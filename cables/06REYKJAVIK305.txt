<a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1.  (U) To date, the Government of Iceland (GOI) has announced 
donations of ISK 24 million ($340,000) in humanitarian aid to 
Lebanon.  The pledges were divided between a 27 July tranche to UN 
agencies and local NGO Church Aid Iceland, and a 15 August tranche 
split between the World Food Program and International Committee of 
the Red Cross.  (Note: the GOI's entire budget for FY2006 is roughly 
$4.5 billion.  End note.) 
 
<a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2.  (U) On 24 August the MFA's Minister Counselor for International 
Organization and Near East Affairs told post that the GOI had no 
immediate plans to increase its assistance to Lebanon but would 
continue to look for opportunities where Icelandic assistance could 
be particularly helpful.  Iceland will be represented at the 
Stockholm Donors' Conference by Icelandic Ambassador to Sweden 
Gudmundur Arni Stefansson.
