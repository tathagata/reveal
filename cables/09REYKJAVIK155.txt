REFS: A) STATE 90254, B) STATE 93894, C) STATE 94420 
 
<a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1. (SBU)  Poloff discussed U.S. goals and objectives for the 
upcoming UN General Assembly (Ref A) with Emil Hreggvidsson, Deputy 
Director for International and Security Affairs at the Icelandic 
Ministry for Foreign Affairs.  Hreggvidsson expressed particular 
interest in the U.S. initiatives relating to gender issues and the 
Middle East.  He said that U.S. and Icelandic priorities closely 
align on these two topics so there is an opportunity for broad-based 
cooperation. 
<a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2. (SBU)  Hreggvidsson also shared with Poloff the themes of 
Iceland's address to the General Assembly, which is scheduled to be 
delivered at 7:00 PM on September 26.  He said that, while Foreign 
Minister Skarphedinsson will briefly touch on the economic crisis 
facing Iceland, the speech will primarily focus on broader topics of 
interest.  The Foreign Minister will specifically raise climate 
change, gender issues, the Middle East and human rights.  He will 
also discuss the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) theory and how it 
relates to global human rights. 
<a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3. (SBU)  Hreggvidsson also confirmed details regarding the schedule 
of Foreign Minister Skarphedinsson, including his intent to attend 
the Transatlantic dinner scheduled for September 22 (Ref C). 
Hreggvidsson said that the Foreign Minister also tentatively plans 
to attend the UNGA Food Security Event on September 26 (Ref B).  He 
promised to provide more concrete information about the FM's plans 
as soon as it becomes available.
