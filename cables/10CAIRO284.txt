meeting with the heads of export councils representing several 
economic sectors to discuss the plan of the Ministry to 
significantly increase Egyptian exports within four years. Prime 
Minister Ahmed Nazif has endorsed the plan, which calls for exports 
to grow to above LE 200 billion (US$36.4 billion), nearly twice the 
current value of Egypt's exports. Nazif described export growth as 
essential to restoring Egypt's high GDP growth rates, and said that 
the GOE will provide various incentives to exporters to help them 
overcome the impacts of the global economic crisis (Al Ahram, Al 
Alam Al Youm, Al Masry Al Youm 2/4/2010, 2/3/2010).

<a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5. (U) Long lines and minor clashes were reported around Egypt as a 
result of a shortage of subsidized butane gas cylinders. The 
cylinders, which are used by many Egyptians for home energy needs, 
have been selling for up to LE 60 (US$10.94) on the black market, 
well above the official price of LE 4 (US$0.73). Several Members of 
Parliament have called for an investigation into the shortage, and 
have called upon the relevant ministries to act to alleviate it. 
The Ministry of Petroleum has pledged to increase the available 
number of cylinders by 100,000, out of an estimated 27-32 million 
cylinders currently in use. The Ministry of Social Solidarity has 
called for the cylinders to be distributed under an annual coupon 
system (Al Ahram, Al Masry Al Youm, Al Shorouk, 2/3/2010, 2/4/2010, 
2/8/2010).
