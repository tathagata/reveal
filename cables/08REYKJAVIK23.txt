<a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1.  (C) Foreign Minister Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir told the 
Ambassador February 19 that the government had discussed the 
independence issue and she expects the GOI to make an announcement 
recognizing Kosovo on February 22.  She noted that Iceland had not 
been the first country to recognize Kosovo, as it had been with the 
Baltic states and Montenegro, because "Kosovo is a different case."

date for recognition. The State Broadcasting Service (RUV) has 
however reported the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will make a 
statement soon confirming that Iceland is "in harmony with other 
European states."
