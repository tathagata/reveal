SUBJECT: AUSTRALIA GROUP:  ICELANDIC LEGISLATION STUCK IN 
CLEARANCE PROCESS 
 
REF: SECSTATE 57932 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR CAROL VAN VOORST, REASON 1.5 (D). 
 
(C) Post discussed reftel points with Icelandic MFA Acting 
Political Director (and Head of Security and Disarmament 
Division) Thordur Bjarni Gudjonsson April 24.  Gudjonsson 
confirmed that catch-all controls legislation has been 
drafted but regretted that it has been stuck for some time in 
the understaffed MFA Legal Adviser's office.  The Legal 
Adviser has undertaken to approve the draft for delivery to 
the Althing (Icelandic Parliament) in time for the 
legislature's fall session, which will begin in October. 
(Note:  The spring session is ending shortly to allow 
politicians to campaign in the run-up to municipal elections 
scheduled to be held nationwide May 27.  End note.) 
Gudjonsson asserted that for practical purposes Iceland is 
meeting its nonproliferation obligations even in the absence 
of a comprehensive domestic legal regime.
