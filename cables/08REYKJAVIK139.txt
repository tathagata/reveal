SUBJECT:  SUPPORT REQUEST TO GAIN ALLIES' AND UKRAINIAN SUPPORT FOR 
THE EXPANDED NATO TRAINING MISSION-IRAQ 
 
REF:  STATE 73794 
 
Classified by:  DCM Neil Klopfenstein for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.(C) DCM raised issue with Icelandic MFA Defense Director on July 
<a id='par14' href='#par14'>Â¶</a>14.  The director said that it was very unlikely that the Government 
of Iceland (GOI) would provide support to an expanded NATO training 
mission in Iraq.  He did not, however, give any indication that the 
GOI would hinder such efforts.
