<a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1. (C) Summary:  With the January 25 constitutional <br>
referendum rapidly approaching, all signs point to victory <br>
for President Morales and his ruling Movement Toward <br>
Socialism (MAS) party.  Although the opposition has made <br>

inroads into the MAS lead, most national polls point to <br>
between 54 and 60 percent support for the proposed <br>
constitution (with one government poll showing 66 percent), <br>
and the MAS appears set to leverage its considerable rural <br>
base to victory.  After a series of national news articles <br>
raised questions about significant fraud in the August 2008 <br>
recall referendum, the National Electoral Court has taken <br>
pains to advertise the electoral rolls as secure.  However, a <br>
recent poll shows less than half of the public shares the <br>

court's confidence, and the opposition believes significant <br>
electoral fraud is likely.  While cheating seems unnecessary <br>
to secure victory for the MAS, padding their lead would give <br>
the party leverage in congressional negotiations regarding <br>
legislation implementing hundreds of vague constitutional <br>
clauses.  Opposition leaders continue to fear the MAS will <br>
use any stalemate in these negotiations to close congress and <br>
institute rule by decree.  At both the national and regional <br>
levels, the margin of victory matters.  A landslide for the <br>

MAS nationally, or large victories for the opposition in the <br>
eastern departments, could spark more conflict.  End summary. <br>

<a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2. (C) With the January 25 constitutional referendum rapidly <br>
approaching, all signs point to victory for President Morales <br>
and his ruling Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party. <br>

Although the opposition has made inroads into their lead, <br>
causing the MAS to tone down its rhetoric, national polls <br>
point to between 54 and 60 percent support for the proposed <br>
constitution.  (One government poll shows the "yes" vote <br>
winning by 66 percent.)  However, many polls downplay or <br>
ignore the MAS' rural base.  Almost as importantly, the MAS <br>
seems prepared to take at least five of the nine departments, <br>
including La Paz, Potosi, Oruro, Cochabamba, and Pando, with <br>
Beni a distinct possibility.  If the MAS can win at levels <br>

similar to their August 2008 referendum victory (i.e. 67 <br>
percent or more) and can make inroads into the "Media Luna" <br>
or eastern half of the country, they will have much more <br>
leverage in upcoming congressional negotiations over <br>
implementing legislation. <br>

Polling Data <br>
- - - - - - <br>

<br>
<a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3. (C) Polling data has varied widely over the past two <br>
weeks, due to a combination of a tightening race and polling <br>
methodologies (i.e. city vs. rural).  Recent national polls <br>
by Gallup and Apoyo within the last week show approval for <br>
the constitution with a much slimmer lead than many expected, <br>
ahead only 48 to 42 percent and 49 to 43 percent, <br>
respectively.  Ipsos and Mori both conducted polls of capital <br>
cities and both found the "yes" vote ahead, with Ipsos <br>

showing a 59 to 35 percent lead and Mori reporting 60 to 40 <br>
percent.  However, our contacts tell us all these polls <br>
partially or totally ignored the rural vote, where the MAS <br>
has much of its base.  A poll by Observatorio de Gestion <br>
Publica, publicized by government-friendly Radio Patria <br>
Nueva, marked the constitution's lead at 66 percent, versus <br>
31 percent against.  Some estimate a six percent "bump" when <br>
the rural vote is included. <br>
<br>

<a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4. (U) Polls showing a breakdown <br>
by city or region indicate <br>
the constitution will easily win in at least four <br>
departments: La Paz, Potosi, Oruro, and Cochabamba, likely <br>
with at least 70 percent support in each.  The MAS has a <br>
distinct chance to capture both Pando and Beni as well.  In <br>
Pando, the Observatorio poll shows Pando department split <br>
evenly, and the Ipsos poll shows the capital city of Cobija <br>
supporting the constitution by a ratio of 64 to 36.  Polling <br>

data for Beni has been more scattershot, but although its <br>
capital city of Trinidad is firmly against the constitution, <br>
by as much as 88 percent, the larger city of Riberalta is <br>
leaning for approval of the constitution.  The Observatorio <br>
poll shows Beni evenly split as a department. <br>

Rural and Indigenous Role <br>

<br>
<a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5. (SBU) Although the opposition is making a mighty effort <br>
across the country to rally against the constitution, the <br>
forces of inertia seem to be conspiring against them, <br>
particularly in the form of a largely uneducated rural base <br>
in the Altiplano.  Leading daily La Razon interviewed several <br>
community leaders from the Altiplano, and their supporters, <br>
and reported on January 18 that neither the leaders nor the <br>
supporters had read the Constitution.  Instead, the repeated <br>

message was that rural communities would take their marching <br>
orders from the MAS, and vote for the constitution. According <br>
to the Ipso poll of capital cities, only four percent of <br>
respondents said they had read much or all of the <br>
constitution, 45 percent of respondents said they have read <br>
some, and 50 percent said they had read none of the draft <br>
text.  In the countryside, the number of those reading the <br>
constitution is much lower.  Post suspects disinterest, blind <br>
faith in Evo Morales' political project, and illiteracy, <br>

despite the Cuban literacy program, all play a role.  In <br>
addition, the sheer volume of the 411-article constitution <br>
probably scares some potential readership away. <br>
<br>
<a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6. (C) However, despite the overall level of MAS dominance <br>
among campesinos and indigenous voters, some opposition does <br>
exist, albeit for a variety of reasons.  The xxxxxxxxxxxx, has tried to rally <br>
support against the MAS and the proposed constitution (Reftel <br>

A).  In a meeting with PolOffs, they lamented the way the MAS <br>
had "cheated" and "fooled" campesinos into believing Morales <br>
was himself truly indigenous or cared about indigenous <br>
issues.  Although they held a national meeting on January 17 <br>
and tried to reach out to the press, they sounded defeated <br>
when they acknowledged that the MAS, through a combination of <br>
funding and pressure on local social and business leaders, <br>
held a "vertical control" in the countryside that would be <br>
difficult to break.  They also noted rural communities tended <br>

to vote in blocks, supporting one political party until they <br>
discarded it to vote en masse for another. <br>
<br>
<a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7. (C) Going in a completely different direction, some rural <br>
social groups and far-left leaders, such as Achacachi Mayor <br>
Eugenio Rojas and El Alto City Councilor Roberto de La Cruz <br>
also publicly recommended voting against it because it was <br>
seen as not revolutionary enough.  They criticized the <br>
government for making too many concessions to the opposition <br>

during the constitutional compromise reached on October 21, <br>
including the agreement to not make land reform retroactive. <br>
However, they have a relatively small following, and some, <br>
like de La Cruz, eventually reversed course as the projected <br>
MAS margin of victory shrunk in January.  Edgar Patana, <br>
leader of the regional workers union (COR), other El Alto <br>
union leaders, and the majority of social groups have <br>
recommended voting for the constitution. <br>

Opposition Feisty, But Realistic <br>

<br>
<a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8. (C) The opposition has not given up, but seems to be <br>
battling <br>
more to limit the margin of defeat than to win.  In <br>
Santa Cruz,xxxxxxxxxxxx<br>
told EmbOff that polls show an overwhelming victory for the <br>

"No" vote in Santa Cruz, but that he is worried about the <br>
opposition's goal of winning in five of Bolivia's nine <br>
departments (Reftel E).  Although a current <br>
privately-commissioned opposition poll showed the <br>
constitution ahead by a margin of only five points, 39 to 34 <br>
percent (with 20 percent undecided), opposition alternate <br>
xxxxxxxxxxxx doubted the opposition would be able to <br>
win the referendum outright even under the most optimistic <br>
scenario.  He predicted that Morales would succeed in <br>

personalizing the constitution as "Evo's constitution" and <br>
leverage his cult of personality.  Ultimately xxxxxxxxxxxx was more <br>
concerned with the margin of the opposition's defeat and <br>
discrediting the results of "any election that uses this <br>
voter roll" (Reftel C). <br>
<br>
<a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx has been <br>
criss-crossing the country with opposition xxxxxxxxxxxx <br>
xxxxxxxxxxxx, campaigning against the proposed constitution, but <br>

also building a foundation for a likely run for the <br>
presidency. xxxxxxxxxxxx claimed opposition leaders put aside <br>
jockeying to be the 2009 opposition unity presidential <br>
candidate in the final days of the "no" campaign to "attack <br>
the government from three sides:" the prefects (governors) <br>
who been traveling around the Media Luna to show &they are <br>
not afraid" of government threats to arrest them and <br>
galvanize support in opposition departments, a group of three <br>

presidential contenders to show opposition unity and <br>
xxxxxxxxxxxx, who is used for more cerebral attacks on the CPE <br>
and to &dismiss the governments mythology that they <br>
exclusively represent the indigenous.8  xxxxxxxxxxxx noted that <br>
opposition parties Podemos and MNR are playing a deliberately <br>
muted role, recognizing that their unpopular association with <br>
the &old regimes8 would play into MAS strategy.  "Political <br>

parties are bad words in Bolivia," xxxxxxxxxxxx <br>
xxxxxxxxxxxx La <br>
Paz-based group of mostly young professionals who focus on <br>
issues and distance themselves from the party moniker.  "We <br>
need parties, but we need to start from scratch, without the <br>
old leaders.  This will take time." <br>
<br>
<a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx told <br>
PolOff the opposition is chipping away at the MAS referendum <br>

lead despite the government's leviathan advantage in <br>
resources by de-personalizing the constitution and <br>
"convincing people on the street that is not in their best <br>
interests."  Although he conceded the "no" campaign would <br>
ultimately be a losing effort, he cited the emerging feud <br>
between Morales and Church, corruption charges against <br>
government officials, and the increasingly precarious economy <br>
as emerging factors in December and January that created an <br>
opposition "surge" after "we were so depressed" in the fall. <br>
xxxxxxxxxxxx said that the government's newfound mobilization of <br>
congressmen and deputies to challenge the opposition view on <br>
television and radio shows is proof of government panic. <br>
"Before they just thought they could ignore us (and win)," <br>
said xxxxxxxxxxxx.  "They said there was no opposition." xxxxxxxxxxxx <br>
agreed, and added that this is playing into the opposition's <br>
hands, because they "are forced to defend a constitution they <br>
often know little about."  According to xxxxxxxxxxxx has <br>
been challenging MAS supporters to debate him during his <br>

speaking tours and embarrassed Vice Minister of Social Groups <br>
Sacha Llorenti in a January 20 debate when he started talking <br>
in fluent Aymara.  He asked the dumbstruck Llorenti what he <br>
planned to do if the constitution passed, since all public <br>
officials will be required to speak one of Bolivia's <br>
indigenous languages.  Later he challenged President Morales <br>
to debate him in Aymara, which the president allegedly speaks <br>
poorly. <br>

Fraud, Doubts, and Questions <br>

<br>
<br>
<a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11. (C) The National Electoral Court (CNE), which will <br>
oversee and ratify the results of the referendum, has <br>
undertaken a public relations campaign to assure the public <br>
of the security of the election rolls, which came under <br>
scrutiny after leading daily La Razon published a series of <br>

articles questioning the validity of the August 10, 2008 <br>
recall referendum.  Several contacts, including xxxxxxxxxxxx <br>
xxxxxxxxxxxx, told us the MAS padded their <br>
August referendum victory by five to seven points through <br>
fraud at several levels (reftel C).  While many international <br>
observers groups are expected to view the January 25 <br>
constitutional referendum -- including the European Union, <br>
the OAS, the Carter Center, the UN, the CAN, the <br>
South-American and Andean parliaments, and UNASUR (septel) -- <br>

the depth of the earlier fraud has muted the opposition's <br>
confidence in observers' ability to ensure the results are <br>
fair.  Members of the Santa Cruz civic committee told EmbOff <br>
that they have no faith in international observers.  The <br>
committee has met with the OAS team already and "told our <br>
side of the story", describing the discoveries of tens of <br>
thousands of false voter cards and the statistical signs of <br>
fraud in areas that managed to vote 100 percent for President <br>
Morales in the August 2008 referendum.  However, the civic <br>

committee said that the fact that international observers <br>
blessed the August referendum means they do not expect an <br>
honest review of the constitutional referendum.  Civic <br>
committee members also noted that small numbers of observers, <br>
generally based in the city, will not be able to stop <br>
widespread fraud in the countryside, which is where they <br>
believe most of the August 10 fraud took place. <br>
<br>
<a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12. (C) In a press conference designed to bolster confidence <br>

in the security of the electoral rolls, National Electoral <br>
Court (CNE) President Jose Luis Exeni presented a PowerPoint <br>
describing the bill of clean health given by the OAS.  As <br>
part of the presentation, he showed the number of voters <br>
dropped from the rolls for not participating in prior <br>
elections and the number added during this cycle.  While all <br>
departments projected to vote against the constitution had a <br>
net reduction in the voter rolls, including 85,000 Crucenos <br>
and 17,000 Benianos, MAS strongholds including La Paz <br>

(38,000) and Potosi (16,000) saw substantial gains -- a <br>
curious reckoning, considering population and migration <br>
trends to the contrary. <br>

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <br>
<br>
<a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13. (C) While it is possible the constitution could pass in <br>
Beni, most opposition leaders tell us the MAS has set its <br>

sights on lightly-populated Pando department as its best <br>
chance to win in five departments.  By winning the popular <br>
vote and a majority of the departments, the MAS could more <br>
credibly claim to have support throughout the country.  Pando <br>
has also traditionally aligned with the opposition, so a <br>
breakthrough win there would send a strong signal that the <br>
strength of the MAS continues to rise.  And with fewer than <br>
32,000 registered voters, or less than one percent of the <br>
country's voting population, Pando is the most vulnerable <br>

department to even small amounts of fraud or voter <br>
registration changes. <br>
<br>
<a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14. (C) In a conversation with PolOff, xxxxxxxxxxxx <br>
xxxxxxxxxxxx alleged the MAS deliberately fomented unrest in Pando <br>
in September to justify a military siege, depose Prefect <br>
Leopoldo Fernandez, and arrest opposition-aligned leaders to <br>
swing the balance of power to the MAS in the Senate.  Besides <br>
disabling the opposition's ability to campaign by arresting <br>

many of its leaders,xxxxxxxxxxxx alleged the government crackdown <br>
changed Pando's electoral map by causing hundreds of <br>
opposition voters to flee to Brazil while importing 2,000 new <br>
security forces, which xxxxxxxxxxxx claimed were likely MAS voters <br>
from the Altiplano (Reftel B).  xxxxxxxxxxxx added <br>
that in the run-up to the August 2008 referendum, Government <br>
Minister Alfredo Rada facilitated the establishment of fake <br>
identities via the police role in issuing national identity <br>
cards (which can then be used to vote).  (Reftel C). <br>

January 26: What Happens Next? <br>
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <br>
<br>
<a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx told PolOff December 31 that <br>
a general election prompted by passage of the new <br>
constitution requires a plethora of enabling legislation that <br>
the opposition-controlled Senate will block, at least in the <br>
forms likely to be proposed by the MAS (Reftel B).  xxxxxxxxxxxx <br>

said the new draft constitution is deliberately vague, which <br>
grants MAS legislators wide discretion to "fill in the <br>
blanks" with new implementing legislation.  He also said the <br>
Senate would clash with the government on assigning new <br>
borders for electoral districts, needed for the general <br>
election.  xxxxxxxxxxxx added that Morales' MAS party is <br>
already injecting "ridiculous" interpretations of the <br>
constitution into a wide gamut of implementing legislation <br>
that "the Senate cannot in good conscious agree to."  He said <br>

Senate rejection of MAS proposals provides a ready excuse for <br>
Morales to dismiss congress for "rejecting the will of the <br>
people" and then have President Morales rule by decree <br>
(Reftel D). <br>
<br>
<a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16. (C) Despite the official government position that <br>
President Morales will undergo treatment to correct a <br>
deviated septum immediately following the referendum, several <br>
contacts confirm that the problem is actually a tumor in the <br>

pituitary near the sella turcica and that Morales will travel <br>
to Spain for the operation.  xxxxxxxxxxxx <br>
xxxxxxxxxxxx told us Morales' first choice, Cuba, could not <br>
perform the surgery.  Article 238 is also of consequence to <br>
the post-January 25 political landscape.  It would establish <br>
that all other government officials must stand down three <br>
months before general elections expected in 2009, with the <br>
notable exception of the president and vice president. <br>
Besides providing the MAS the advantage of ruling during the <br>

campaign, it also ensures leadership cannot pass to the <br>
opposition-controlled Senate.  It is unclear why the <br>
opposition waited until the final week before the referendum <br>
to complain about the article or why they accepted it during <br>
marathon sessions in October to arrive at a "compromise <br>
text," which, it should be noted, the opposition agreed to <br>
under duress, with thousands of MAS-aligned protesters <br>
surrounding the congress and threatening violence. <br>
<br>

Comment <br>
- - - - <br>
<br>
<a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17. (C) It is likely there will be some amount of fraud in a <br>
referendum the MAS seems likely to win legitimately anyway. <br>
While it can be difficult to separate fact from fiction, the <br>
Morales administration has a reputation of doing exactly what <br>
they announce they will do.  In this case, 66 percent seems <br>

to be the target number, and the MAS is likely to pull out <br>
all the stops to reach that level.  With at least two-thirds <br>
support across the country and a minimum of five of the nine <br>
departments under his belt, President Morales would be able <br>
to claim a political mandate to implement the constitution <br>
quickly.  Practically speaking, this will put great pressure <br>
on the Congress, especially the opposition-controlled Senate, <br>
to acquiesce in negotiations and accept MAS versions of <br>
implementation legislation.  If they do not, Morales and <br>

others in the MAS have spoken of rule by decree.  Using <br>
similar logic, Morales could call for early elections to more <br>
quickly advance the "democratic revolution" in Bolivia. <br>
Early elections would also help the MAS avoid dealing with <br>
the quickly-crumbling economy, which would likely be more of <br>
an issue in December. <br>
<br>
<a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18. (C) Both sides seem to be angling over the margin of the <br>
MAS victory, not the victory itself.  While Morales continues <br>

to predict a victory of up to 80 percent, Vice President <br>
Garcia <br>
Linera tried to manage expectations with a 66 percent <br>
estimate on January 21.  The margin matters.  If the <br>
constitution gets less than two-thirds support, many <br>
observers feel this would represent a relative defeat, <br>
especially when Morales himself has set such high <br>
expectations.  On the other hand, we are equally concerned <br>
that large-margin victories in media luna departments could <br>

lead opposition leaders to ignore the national results and <br>
resume a course for autonomy on their own terms -- putting <br>
them on a collision course with the national government.  A <br>
solid but not overwhelming MAS victory, perhaps around 56 to <br>
60 percent, might be the best outcome to keep both sides from <br>
claiming a strong mandate for extreme measures. <br>
