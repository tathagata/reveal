CEASE THE ILLEGAL EXPLOITATION OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES, 
AND TO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN THE INTERCONGOLESE DIALOG.

CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEATH OF OVER ONE MILLION PEOPLE IN THE 
PAST FEW YEARS. 

<a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4. (C) CHARGE INQUIRED IF THE HOLY SEE WOULD BE 
APPROACHING OTHER COUNTRIES IN ADDITION TO THE U.S. AND THE 
UK. MIGLIORE SAID THAT THE VATICAN HAD DECIDED TO LIMIT 
ITS DEMARCHE TO THE U.S. AND THE UK ON THE SITUATION IN THE 
KIVU REGION BECAUSE IT BELIEVES WE ARE THE TWO COUNTRIES

HOWEVER, THE VATICAN WILL BE CONTACTING THE ANGOLANS AND 
THE ZIMBABWEANS TO URGE THEM TO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN THE 
DIALOG. MIGLIORE SAID THAT HE BELIEVES ZIMBABWE IS GOING 
TO RESIST AS PRESIDENT MUGBAE'S SON IS A KEY PLAYER IN THE

BELGIAN AMBASSADOR.
