SUBJECT:  READOUT FROM THE ICELANDIC PARTICIPANT AT E-PINE MEETING 
 
<a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1. (SBU) Charge d'Affaires met with Greta Gunnarsdottir, Director 
General for International and Security Affairs at the Icelandic 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on November 30 to discuss her 
participation in the November 5 Enhanced Partnership in Northern 
Europe (E-PINE) meeting in Washington.  Gunnarsdottir called the 
E-PINE meeting an enormous success and said that her Nordic 
colleagues, in private follow-up conversations, had expressed 
similar satisfaction.  Gunnarsdottir felt that the E-PINE meeting 
clearly laid out the tremendous role that Europe must play in 
resolving the world's most pressing problems, notably Iran and 
Afghanistan.  She added that she felt the U.S. sent a strong message 
in the meeting that it intends to cooperate with Europe on these 
complicated matters. 
 
<a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2. (SBU) The discussions regarding Iran clearly resonated with 
Gunnarsdottir.  Were Iran to develop nuclear capabilities, she said, 
it could destabilize the entire region and potentially lead 
neighboring countries to also acquire nuclear weapons. 
Gunnarsdottir said that if the situation does not improve, sanctions 
may be the only viable response.  She added, however, that the 
decision to impose sanctions on Iran would need to be approved by 
the U.N. Security Council, which would require the support of 
Russia.  Gunnarsdottir expressed hope that U.S. relations with 
Russia are indeed improving as she felt that Russian cooperation 
would be necessary for reaching a solution on Iran. 
 
<a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3. (SBU) Gunnarsdottir also reported that a productive conversation 
on Afghanistan occurred at the E-PINE meeting.  She said 
participants agreed that Hamid Karzai must do more to combat 
corruption in Afghanistan and also that more attention must be 
placed on the important role Pakistan plays in the matter. 
Gunnarsdottir added that Afghanistan will remain a top priority for 
the Government of Iceland.  (Note: Iceland has five individuals 
serving in Afghanistan and expects to maintain that commitment for 
the foreseeable future.  End Note.)</pre></code>
