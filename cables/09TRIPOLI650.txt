REF: Khartoum 372 
 
1.(U) This is an action request. Please see para

<a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2. (SBU) Libyan Director of Military Intelligence xxxxxxxxxxxx hosted a meeting August 11 with UN/AU Joint Moderator Djbril Bassole, Qatari Minister of State al-Mahmoud and six members of the Sudan Liberation Army/Unity faction (SLA/U). SLA/U representative Sayyid Sharif provided a brief readout of the meeting to poloff via telcon, saying the parties discussed modalities for an August 18 meeting in Addis Ababa between SLA/U and members of Abdul Wahid's faction to move forward on rebel unification. Separately, the Egyptian embassy said their Special Envoy also participated in the meeting, though was unable to provide further detail -- including whether Sudanese Presidential Advisor Ghazi Salaheddin Atabani participated in the meeting. SLA/U representative Osman Bushra confirmed that SLA/U chairman Abdullah Yehia was not present in the meeting. Instead, six members from the "Unity Plus" agreement signed in Tripoli March 15 (reftel) were represented: Sayyid Sharif and Mahjoub Hussein from SLA/U, Masahra (phonetic) from SLA/Juba, Ashraf from JEM/Idris Azraq, and a member of the SLA/Bakhit group.

3.(SBU) The Justice and Equality Movement's (JEM) Tripoli representative Suliman Abdalla Ismail confirmed that JEM President Khalil Ibrahim arrived in Tripoli on August 10 and expected to meet Muammar al-Qadhafi some time on August 10 or

<a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11. JEM and SLA/U representatives told poloff they were aware the rival faction was in town for high-level meetings, but SLA/U said they would not meet with Khalil Ibrahim unless the JEM publicly acknowledged SLA as a viable resistance movement operating in Darfur -- a condition they did not expect to be met in the short term.

4.(SBU) Comment and action request: Charge has requested an official read-out from MFA-equivalent officials here. Both rebel factions expected they would be called for several more meetings over the course of the day August 11, and requested meetings with poloff August 12. We would appreciate the Department's guidance on USG views on this latest round of negotiations and any upcoming travel related to the unification initiative. POLASCHIK</pre></code>
