SUBJECT: HOLY SEE: AMBASSADOR PRESSES VATICAN ON IRAQ 

REF: A) LARREA - EMBASSY VATICAN EMAIL APRIL 19, B) VATICAN 76, C) MARTIN - EUR/WE EMAIL APR 13 

CLASSIFIED BY: Christopher Sandrolini, Charge d'affaires a.i., 
EXEC, State. 
REASON: 1.4 (d) 
<a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1. (C) The Ambassador raised ref (a) points on Iraq with the 
Holy See's Secretary for Relations with States (FM equivalent), 
Archbishop Dominique Mamberti, April 20. The Ambassador 
emphasized the many positive developments that have occurred in 
various parts of Iraq. He acknowledged that much work remained 
to be done, but said that we didn't see how the papal comment on 
the subject (ref b) was constructive under the circumstances. 

<a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2. (C) Mamberti said that he understood our concerns. He 
admitted that there were at least some bright spots in some area 
of the country, but insisted that the overall death toll was 
overshadowing those developments. Pope Benedict was speaking 
about the overall situation on the ground, he emphasized. 

<a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3. (C) The Ambassador reiterated out commitment to remain in 
close contact with the Vatican on Iraq, and asked that the Holy 
See offer forward-looking comments on the situation. 

<a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4. (C) Comment: The Ambassador's demarche, coupled with 
lower-level conversations on the same subject (ref c), has been 
noted by Holy See Secretariat of State personnel, according to 
one of our close contacts. We will continue to press for 
constructive comments from Vatican officials on Iraq.
