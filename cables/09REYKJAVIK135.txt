Gunnarsdottir, head of the International and Security Affairs 
Directorate at the Icelandic Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on August

the mission in Afghanistan.

situation in Iceland, the GOI is cutting back on many of its global 
peace keeping projects.  She offered assurances, however, that 
Afghanistan would remain a top priority for the Icelandic 
Government.  She also suggested that the seven or eight Icelanders 
who are currently serving in Afghanistan would remain in their 
positions for the foreseeable future.
