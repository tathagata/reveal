SUBJECT: Iceland: Press in New York for a position on Partnership 
for Democratic Governance 
 
Refs: A) State 108794 
 
 B) State 131040 
 
<a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1.  (SBU) Summary:  Iceland's Ministry for Foreign Affairs remains 
noncommittal on Iceland's involvement in the OECD Partnership for 
Democratic Governance (PDG), despite repeated overtures from Post. 
Embassy believes this may be a result of uncertainty about the form 
and objectives of the PDG as well as the fact that Iceland's 
development aid policy is apparently under review by the Minister 
for Foreign Affairs.  Post suggests engagement on the margins of 
UNGA to clarify details of the PDG and press for Icelandic support. 
End Summary. 
 
<a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2.  (SBU) DCM, Econ Chief, and visiting EUR/NB Desk Officer 
presented Ref A points to the Director-General for External Trade 
and Economic Affairs at Iceland's Ministry for Foreign Affairs on 
August 21.  Earlier in the day, Pol Chief, EUR/NB DeskOff and Pol 
Intern made a similar presentation to the MFA's Counsellor for Human 
Rights and Democracy Issues.  Both were appreciative but 
noncommittal, saying they would raise the issue within the ministry. 
 In follow-up contacts on September 14 and again on September 20 to 
present Ref B information, MFA contacts were similarly undecided 
about Iceland's participation.  Icelandic MFA's Minister-Counsellor 
for International Organization Affairs Nikulas Hannigan told Pol 
Chief on September 20 that the issue was "under review" at the 
ministry, but added on a separate topic that development aid was one 
of Iceland's main issues of interest for the upcoming UN General 
Assembly (UNGA). 
 
<a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3.  (SBU) Comment:  EmbOffs have learned separately that Minister 
for Foreign Affairs Gisladottir has asked for a review of Iceland's 
development aid policy, including an exploration of merging the 
Icelandic International Development Agency (ICEIDA) into the 
Ministry.  Currently, ICEIDA handles bilateral aid projects while 
the MFA has responsibility for multilateral donations.  We speculate 
that this review may be stalling commitments to other initiatives. 
 
<a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4.  (SBU) Comment, cont'd:  Post recommends engagement with the 
Icelandic missions at the UN and OECD to clarify thinking on the PDG 
as well as direct engagement with the Icelandic delegation at UNGA 
to help flush out MFA thinking on the issue.
