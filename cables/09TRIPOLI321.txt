(SBU) In an April 22 conversation with the Charge', the MFA's director of international organization affairs, Mahdi Mujerbi, said the GOL was pleased to support the U.S. on the recent PRST on DPRK sanctions and appreciated that the US was taking into account Libya's opposition to sanctions that could affect the general population (see reftels). He said the MFA was studying the U.S. proposal for targeted measures. He noted that the Libyan mission to the UN was exchanging information and views on the matter with USUN and promised to inform us when the GOL made a decision. STEVENS.</pre></code>
