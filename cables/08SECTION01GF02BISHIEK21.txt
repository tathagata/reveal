a qtatemejt by ZaiiRa Mildnzheva$ who identified heRself aS a Tah 
I.qpectiOn O&ficer ajd accUqed the Head of t(e K9rgyz T x I*sp%ctikb 
gf coRrup4ign.  Z!eira Mkddozheva was apparently an alias, and the 
author of the letter was never identified. 
 
<a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4. (SBU) It is possible that the letter was an attempt to "frame" 
the newspaper, as one day after the letter was published, police 
raided "De Fakto," confiscated computers and documents, and sealed 
the offices.  Officials accused Editor-in-Chief Cholpon Orozobekova 
of "deliberately providing false statements," a criminal charge 
normally reserved for those who provide false statements to law 
enforcement officials and is punishable by up to 5 years 
imprisonment.  Orozobekova's bank accounts and assets were frozen. 
Government officials and organizations also filed defamation claims 
against "De Fakto" and won awards of 4 million soms (over $112,000). 
 Orozobekova has since gone into hiding, unable to pay the 5 million 
soms she owes and fearing criminal prosecution. 
 
<a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5.  (SBU) "Alibi" newspaper took a different tack, agreeing to pay 
the one million soms compensation to Saliyev and printing a 
retraction.  It only asked the court for some time to come up with 
the money and to make payments in installations.  Nonetheless, on 
August 22, police seized the whole press run of the paper "under 
legal process."  Prosecutors went one step further, filing a 
criminal case for "malicious non-fulfillment of a court decision" 
against Editor-in-Chief Babyrbek Djeenbekov.  On August 29, in an 
attempt to avoid paying the fine, Djeenbekov closed down Alibi and 
published the final issue, which announced the establishment of a 
new newspaper, "Achyk Sayasat" ("Open Politics").  On September 10, 
Djeenbekov was arrested for failing to comply with a court verdict 
but was released the following day. (Comment: In Kyrgyzstan, 
newspapers can avoid paying libel damages by ceasing operations and 
reopening under a different legal name.)

<a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6. (SBU) On July 29, a court hearing was held to rule on a claim 
against monthly human rights bulletin "Prava Dlja Vseh" ("Rights for 
Everyone").  Manager of the South Kyrgyz Cement Factory and former 
Minister of Industry, Yan Fisher, filed a civil suit against "Prava 
Dlja Vseh" because the bulletin published an article that was 
critical of South Kyrgyz Cement's hiring practices.  Mr. Fisher 
asked the court to press criminal charges against the publication, 
to fine it 1 million soms, and to close it down.  After human rights 
activists intervened, the parties came to an amicable agreement. 
 
<a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7. (SBU) On August 26, Osh city Vice-Mayor Ainura Shayimkulova filed 
a defamation case against "Jany Zaman" newspaper, requesting 1 
million soms compensation for insulting her honor and dignity.  The
