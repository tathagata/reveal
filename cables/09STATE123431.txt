SUBJECT: ATTEMPTS BY IRANIAN FIRM TO ACQUIRE MACHINE TOOLS FROM BRAZIL (S) 
Classified By: ISN/MTR DIRECTOR PAM DURHAM FOR REASONS 1.4 (B), (C), AND (D). 

<a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1. (U) This is an action request. Embassy Brasilia, Please see paragraph 3. 

<a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2. (S) Background: We want to alert the government of Brazil to a possible effort by the Iranian firm Machine Sazi Tabriz to acquire machine tools from a Brazilian company. Machine Sazi Tabriz is the largest manufacturer of machine tools in Iran and has likely supplied imported machine tools to Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Because we are concerned that any export of machine tools to Machine Sazi Tabriz potentially could be diverted to Iran's Weapons development programs, we want to share this information with Brazilian officials and ask that they investigate this activity. We also want to request that they take all appropriate measures, including the use of their catch-all controls, to closely scrutinize all machine tool exports to Iran to prevent such equipment from being used to support programs of proliferation concern.
