SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED: MOBILIZING PRESSURE TO PERSUADE IRAN'S ENGAGEMENT ON ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM REF: STATE 9124

1.(SBU) Pol/Econ Chief delivered ref demarche to MFA Director of the International Organizations Department, Mehdi al-Mjribi, on February 10. Mjribi reiterated Libya's support of nuclear non-proliferation initiatives and said that all nations should commit to the principles expressed within the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty. The GOL is in favor of a diplomatic resolution to the situation with Iran and does not believe that sanctions will achieve a positive outcome. The GOL believes that sanctions negatively affect a nation's citizens more than its government and that diplomatic pressure on Iran should continue to be addressed within the context of the P5+1 group. Mjribi emphasized that the GOL and Libyan leader Muammar al-Qadhafi recognize the value of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and believe that it is the right of each nation to pursue peaceful nuclear programs.
