SUBJECT: ICELAND WILL NOT ATTEND PSI HIGH-LEVEL POLITICAL 
MEETING 
 
REF: SECSTATE 84640 
 
<a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1. Having forwarded a copy of the Polish invitation May 31, 
post spoke with MFA Acting Political Director Thordur Bjarni 
Gudjonsson June 9 to reiterate the significance of the 
Proliferation Security Initiative High Level Political 
Meeting as well as the planned high level of U.S. 
representation.  Gudjonsson reported that Reykjavik had 
regretfully concluded June 8 that it had inadequate staff 
resources to send someone to the June 23 meeting in Warsaw. 
 
<a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2.  Comment:  The Icelandic MFA is indeed stretched 
especially thin at present:  Political Director Bergdis 
Ellertsdottir is on maternity leave until September; 
Reykjavik hosted a Council of Baltic Sea States summit June 8 
(even though it is not on the Baltic Sea); and the GOI 
announced this week that Prime Minister Halldor Asgrimsson 
would step down this month and that Foreign Minister Geir 
Haarde would replace him.  No new FM has yet been named, and 
career Icelandic diplomats say they do not yet have a clear 
read on whom the Government is likely to name as Haarde's 
successor.  End comment.
