<a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2. (C) Comment: Bakir appears to be a competent broker, with relevant prior experience as an engineer in the Aviation industry. He noted his company is a member of TRACE, International (an organization that promotes transparency and good governance in business), and is the only member of this organization in Libya. Emboff had the impression he works mainly as a consultant as his company has no real physical office. Bakir works out of his residence. End comment. CRETZ</pre></code>
