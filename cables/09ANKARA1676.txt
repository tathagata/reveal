SUBJECT: SUPPORT TO NEW KARZAI GOVERMENT REF: A. STATE 118297 B. ANKARA 1661 Classified By: DCM Doug Silliman for reasons 1.4 (b,d)

1.(C) DCM delivered reftel points to MFA SRAP-equivalent Deputy U/S Engin Soysal on November 17. Soysal reaffirmed Turkey's commitment to Afghanistan and confirmed that FM Davutoglu, accompanied by MFA U/S Sinirlioglu, will attend President Karzai's inauguration. Soysal said the GOT will continue to emphasize to President Karzai the importance and urgency of national reconciliation and building unity among all sectors of Afghan society. Soysal said the elections created negative feelings among the Afghan people and that Karzai should "launch a new period with the confidence and trust of the Afghan people." Turkey has already developed a plan to offer its support to Afghanistan and the new government. In their "Action Plan for Afghanistan," the MFA outlines "immediate steps" that include NATO, trilateral and international efforts, which Turkey proposes to lead (REF B).

2.(C) According to Soysal, the GOT will also encourage strong international support for President Karzai. Both the international community and the people of Afghanistan need a strong leader, and Karzai must be supported to ensure that he can take the steps necessary for national reconciliation. Soysal said that the GOT believes a positive, supportive approach with Karzai will work better than increased international pressure.
