(C) The GoNL will either abstain or vote no today (10/21) on 
an UNGA resolution seeking an advisory opinion from the 
International Court of Justice on whether the Israeli barrier 
currently being built must be taken down. The GoNL has yet 
to decide how it will vote on the resolution to declare 
Israel in violation of international law due to the fence. 
Pieter Ramaer, head of the MFA's UN Political and Judicial 
Division, reported that the EU wants to avoid a split vote; 
however, it may very well occur. EU countries will meet at 
9:00 EST on 10/21 to further discuss the resolution. Ramaer 
reported the Dutch are currently uncomfortable with some of 
the text. (Note: Ramaer only elaborated by stating that the 
Dutch are reviewing the wording used in the naming of 
terrorist organizations. End note.) Ramaer stated that 
nevertheless if the text of the resolution was decent, the 
GoNL would be inclined to vote favorably for the resolution. 
He said that several EU states are strongly inclined to vote 
in favor of the resolution, no matter the text.
