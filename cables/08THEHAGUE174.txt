REF: STATE 15228

Classified By: CDA Andrew Schofer, reasons 1.4 (b,d)

<a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1. (S) Polmiloff discussed reftel points with MFA Senior
Advisor for Nonproliferation and Nuclear Affairs Ceta Noland
on February 25. Noland appreciated the points, and claimed
to be aware of Inter Connection Technologies (InCo Tech).
She needed to confirm, but thought the GONL might have
already issued a MTCR catch-all against InCo Tech. At any
rate, Noland said she would pass on the points to the
relevant Dutch intelligence authorities; any response will
most likely be handled through those channels, she added.

<a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2. (S) Noland commented in passing on Aviation Services
International (ASI), noting that ASI Director Robert
Kraaipoel appears to be maintaining relations with Iran as he
was recently seen at a reception at the Iranian Embassy in
The Hague. That said, Noland understood that ASI has ceased
its attempts to export material to Iran. She asked for an
update on the U.S. case against ASI; polmiloff replied that
he had no updates on the case, which was being handled
through the Department of Justice.
