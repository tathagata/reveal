SUBJECT: ICELAND: TAPPED OUT ON TRUST FUND FOR NTM-I 
 
REF: A. (A) SECSTATE 83457 
     <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B. (B) REYKJAVIK 69 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR CAROL VAN VOORST, REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
<a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1. (SBU) Post passed ref A talking points on pledging 
additional funds to the NATO Training Mission-Iraq to 
Icelandic MFA officials May 24 and discussed them with Acting 
Political Director Thordur Bjarni Gudjonsson June 9. 
Gudjonsson expressed surprise that Washington would be 
demarching Reykjavik again so soon after Iceland's latest EUR 
150,000 pledge (ref B).  Poloff reiterated USG appreciation 
for Iceland's 2005 and 2006 contributions, stressing, 
however, that the need for enhanced NTM-I funding is now 
acute.  Gudjonsson stated that his government would consider 
an additional pledge "in due course" but that such largesse 
was "not on the agenda" at present. 
 
<a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2. (C) In the same conversation, Gudjonsson expressed anxiety 
that no date has yet been set for the next round of bilateral 
talks on U.S. defense of Iceland following closure of Naval 
Air Station Keflavik this autumn.  He implied that future 
Icelandic funding of NATO missions is in part contingent on 
how much Reykjavik finds it will need to budget for homeland 
defense after the U.S. restructures its forces here.
