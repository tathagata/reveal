SUBJECT: ENGAGING GOB ON SITUATION IN HAITI 

REF: A. PORT AU PRINCE 1497 
<a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B. PORT AU PRINCE 1485 (NOTAL) 
Classified By: DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION PHILIP CHICOLA. REASONS: 1.4(B)( D) 

<a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1. (C) We read with deep concern ref a and b assessments of the deteriorating security situation and endangered political process in Haiti. In light of these trends, we believe it is urgent that we engage directly at senior levels with the GOB, to gather information regarding their current assessment of MINUSTAH and potential replacement of its Brazilian commander, and also to seek common approaches to dealing with a total collapse in civil order and any attempts by Aristide to return or subvert the elections. We have a meeting scheduled for Ambassador Danilovich on 8 June with President Lula da Silva's international affairs advisor, Marco Aurelio Garcia, who has traveled to Haiti as the president's envoy and who has adopted a tough line against Aristide that we want to reinforce. We may also seek an appointment with Ambassador Jose Felicio, the Foreign Ministry's lead official on Haiti, if Felicio does not travel next week to Haiti to meet with A/S Noreiga. 

<a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2. (C) To prepare for these and follow-up engagements with the GOB on Haiti, we would appreciate guidance and talking points from Department at the earliest opportunity on the critical issues and views we should register with the Brazilians. In particular, we would welcome points to share with the GOB on responding to South African President Mbeki in the event he seeks out President Lula to discuss Aristide. 

<a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3. (U) Please advise. 

DANILOVICH</pre></code>
