Station Keflavik (NASKEF), as well as an agreement amending

<a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2. (SBU) Following on the 26 September announcement by PM 
Haarde  of the conclusion of defense negotiations with the 
U.S. (reftel), Foreign Minister Valgerdur Sverrisdottir on 29 
September signed the "Technical Agreement" covering the 
withdrawal of U.S. forces and the return of agreed areas to 
the GOI.  (DoD U/S Edelman had earlier signed the documents 
in Washington.)  The Minister also signed a document amending 
certain provisions of the 1951 U.S.-Iceland defense agreement 
as well as its annexes and technical schedules, some of which 
were classified per the GOI's 1951 request. (On 26 September 
post received a diplomatic note from the MFA requesting that 
all defense agreements between the U.S. and Iceland be 
declassified; we have forwarded to EUR/NB for action.)

Captain Mark Laughton and MFA officials completed the

USG-owned NASKEF equipment essential to continued operations 
at Keflavik Airport.  On the evening of 29 September, Navy 
Security will hand over responsibility for the base to the 
Keflavik District Police, who will protect its facilities 
while a new public corporation (reftel) considers a growing 
number of proposals for their use.
