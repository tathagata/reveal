SUBJECT: KASHMIRI PARAMILITARY SEEKING US VISA 
Classified By: PolCouns Ted Osius, Reason 1.5 (B,D)
<a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1. (S) This is an ACTION Request for the Department. SCA please see paragraph 4.
<a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2. (S) Summary: Kashmiri paramilitary leader and J&K State MLA Usman Abdul Majid is seeking a U.S. visa to attend functions hosted in Washington by the United States Institute of Peace starting on June 7th. Majid is a leader of the pro-GOI Ikhawan-ul-Musilmeen paramilitary group, which is made up of former Kashmiri terrorists who have surrendered to the GOI. Beginning in the early 1990s, India’s security forces used Ikhwan to combat terrorism in the Srinagar Valley. Known for its brutal and corrupt practices, Ikhwan is notorious for its use of torture, extra-judicial killing, rape, and extortion of Kashmiri civilians suspected of harboring or facilitating terrorists. In the interest of remaining balanced in our approach tothe Kashmir issue following Embassy New Delhi’s denial of Sayeed Ali Shah Geelani’s visa request, Post recommends denying this visa application as well. End Summary.
A Dubious History
----------------- 
<a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3. (S) Kashmiri paramilitary leader and J&K state MLA Usman Abdul Majid applied for a U.S. visa on May 22nd in order to attend functions held by the United States Institute of Peace starting on June 7th in Washington, DC. Majid is a leader of the pro-GOI Ikhawan-ul-Musilmeen paramilitary group, which was formed by India’s security forces to combat terrorism in the Kashmir Valley. The group is made up of terrorists who have surrendered to the Indian government and agreed to fight against their former brethren. Ikhawan has a reputation in the Valley for committing brutal human rights abuses -- including extra-judicial killings of suspected terrorists and their family members, as well as torturing, killing, raping, and extorting Kashmiri civilians suspected of harboring or facilitating terrorists. Majid won election easily in his Baramullah district of Kashmir, but this is likely only because the district has had a minute voter turnout as terrorist groups continue to enforce a boycott there of Indian-held elections. This boycott continued in Baramullah even in 2002, when turnout was much higher in other areas. Similar to many of the instances of torture and violence surrounding the Kashmir dispute, Post is unable to verify with evidence the claims against Majid.
<a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4. (S) Action request: Post requests guidance as to how to proceed with Majid’s visa application. Visas donkey will follow septel.
<a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5. (S) Comment: Majid’s reputation in the Kashmir Valley is one of the worst among those associated with the GOI. In light of our rejection of the Geelani visa, we will not be able to maintain our record of neutrality in the Kashmir dispute if we grant this visa. Nonetheless, denying his application may have some repercussions with GOI officials, especially those from India’s Intelligence Bureau who have been close to his case. As with the Geelani case, this will be a very delicate matter, but in light of Ikhawan’s history, Post recommends that the U.S. government deny the visa. MULFORD</pre></code>
