SUBJECT: ICELAND SUPPORTS ENGAGING GEORGIA IN NATO'S 
INTENSIFIED DIALOGUE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 51994 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR CAROL VAN VOORST, REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
<a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1. (C) Post delivered reftel demarche on April 4 to Thordur 
Bjarni Gudjonsson, Icelandic MFA Head of Security and 
Disarmament Division.  Gudjonsson affirmed that Iceland 
agrees with U.S. points and will support intensified dialogue 
(ID) on NATO membership with Georgia.  A Georgian delegation 
headed by Deputy Foreign Minister Georgi Manjgaladze and 
Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Konstantin 
Gabashvili visited Reykjavik March 27-28 to brief the 
Government of Iceland on democratic developments in Georgia 
and to urge integration of Georgia into Euro-Atlantic 
structures.  According to Gudjonsson, the Georgians made a 
compelling case that their country has shown tremendous 
democratic progress. 
 
<a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2. (C) Comment:  Iceland strongly supports NATO enlargement 
so long as the process remains merit-based.  Iceland is also 
ordinarily inclined to join NATO consensus.  If Allies are 
largely sympathetic to ID, and later a Membership Action 
Plan, for Georgia, Iceland will comfortably follow their 
lead.  End comment.
