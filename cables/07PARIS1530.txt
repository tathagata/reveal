SUBJECT: FRENCH HEDGE ON COMPACT SIGNING EVENT 
 
REF: A. STATE 47346 
 
     <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B. STATE 50497 
 
Classified By: Political Minister-Counselor Josiah Rosenblatt, reasons 
1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
<a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1. (C) Poloff delivered Reftel points to MFA Senior Iraq Desk 
Officer Bernard Chappedelaine on April 16.  Chappedelaine 
noted that it might be difficult to secure French ministerial 
representation at the Compact signing event due to the French 
presidential elections; he predicted that the French would 
wait until shortly before the signing ceremony before 
finalizing their representational plans.  (Note: French 
ministers are curbing their foreign travel during the 
election period, and FM Douste-Blazy is personally engaged in 
campaigning for Nicolas Sarkozy.)  With respect to the EIB, 
Chappedelaine said the MFA would need to consult with the 
Finance Ministry before providing a substantive response.  On 
technical assistance, Chappedelaine objected that France has 
already offered to train up to 150 Iraqi civil servants per 
year.  Poloff countered that France should consider expanding 
its training program in order to demonstrate its support for 
Iraq and the Compact, and Chappedelaine reluctantly conceded 
that an expansion might be possible. 
 
<a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2. (C) On a more positive note, Chappedelaine said France may 
soon make a 500,000 euro donation to provide humanitarian 
assistance to Iraqi refugees, in part so as to lessen the 
burden the refugees impose on neighboring states (in 
particular, Jordan). 
 
<a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3. (C) Post will also deliver reftel points at the earliest 
possibility to Jean-Pierre Guinhut, France's 
Inter-Ministerial Coordinator for Iraq reconstruction.
