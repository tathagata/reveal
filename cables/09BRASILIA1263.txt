<a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6. (C) Jozame explained that he continues to inform the GOB and Latin American missions in Brasilia about the U.S.-Colombia DCA, in an attempt to combat the misinformation campaign led by Chavez and the other more left-leaning neighbors in the region. In meetings in August Jozame told PolOff he had already met with several Brazilian members of Congress and the leadership of the Latin American missions in Brasilia (Ref A). Jozame said that he had recently held a meeting at the Colombian Embassy with about 35 military attaches from embassies in Brasilia so that he and his staff could again clarify the details of the U.S.-Colombia DCA. Jozame also mentioned that a Brazilian congressional delegation will be traveling to Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador in November. According to Jozame, their goal in Colombia is to see for themselves the bases included in the DCA. Jozame said he is happy the Brazilians have finally taken the Colombians up on the invitation to visit the bases because all they will see at the bases are "some buildings and a landing strip." 

<a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7. (C) Jozame shared his personal views as to why the Brazilians had such a negative initial reaction to the DCA, claiming that most of the problem came from the MRE which is "leftist" and "anti-Yankee" and "jealous" of any other country,s leadership in the region. Jozame said that the leadership in the MRE is very leftist and because of that they did not support greater cooperation between Colombia and the United States. Also, he believes Brazil is jealous because it does not like to have any issues negotiated or discussed without Brazil serving in a leadership role. 

<a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8. (C) Comment: Lula,s open approval of the U.S.-Colombia DCA will make it hard for the GOB to support criticism of the agreement by others in the region against the agreement. However, as Lula admitted and several GOB officials have told us privately, Brazil,s initial reaction was driven by the reaction of others in the region "principally Venezuela" and by a perceived need to maintain "balance" and the ability to mediate between the two sides. This dynamic is likely to hold sway in the future, as well, regarding issues of sovereignty and the sanctity of borders.
