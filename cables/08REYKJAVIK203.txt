<a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1. (U) As a result of the international financial crisis and lack of 
liquidity in the credit markets, the Icelandic krona (ISK) has taken 
a beating, falling almost 50 percent since the start of the year. 
On September 17 the ISK trade weighted index, which measures the 
price in ISK of a weighted average of the currencies of Iceland's 
biggest trade partners, hit a record high.  There is consensus among 
most Icelandic experts that the ISK has hit close to bottom, but 
none predict when it will start strengthening. 
 
<a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2. (U) Iceland is very dependent on imports and the exchange rate 
has a large influence on prices of consumer goods.  The 12-month 
inflation rate now measures at 14.5 percent.  Many Icelanders are 
also feeling the pinch as their monthly payments on foreign currency 
loans -- a common instrument for car loans and mortgages -- have 
risen dramatically. 
 
<a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3. (U) Calls for adopting the Euro have increased as the ISK has 
slipped.  Prominent members of the Progressive Party, an opposition 
party in Parliament, are proposing a referendum in early 2009 on 
joining the EU.  However, Prime Minister Geir Haarde continues to 
take what he calls a pragmatic approach to the currency issue and he 
believes the benefits of keeping the ISK outweigh those of adopting 
the Euro at this time.
