SUBJECT:  ICELAND RECOGNIZES KOSOVO'S INDEPENDENCE 
 
REF:  REYKJAVIK 0027 
 
<a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1.  (U) On March 5, 2008, Iceland recognized the Republic of 
Kosovo as an independent state. 
 
<a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2. (SBU) Comment:  Although the recognition comes almost two 
weeks after the initial date the Foreign Minister suggested to 
the Ambassador (see reftel), it falls neither first nor last 
among the Nordic countries, which is where the Icelanders 
wanted to be.  When poloff asked about the delay today, an MFA 
official said the issue was "complicated," but offered no 
substantive explanation.
