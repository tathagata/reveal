CLASSIFIED BY: Joan Polaschik, DCM, U.S. Embassy Tripoli, Department of State. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d)

<a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1. (C) DCM and DATT met with MFA A/S-equivalent Ahmed Fituri on October 8, at his request, to discuss pending security assistance and mil-mil cooperation issues. Fituri said that he had arranged the meeting at the behest of Libyan National Security Advisor Dr. Muatassim al-Qadhafi, who was eager to move cooperation forward following Muammar al-Qadhafi's visit to the New York for the UN General Assembly. Fituri added that he hoped progress on these pending issues -- including possible Libyan participation in Bright Star exercises -- would lay the groundwork for successful political-military talks later this year.

<a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2. (C) Noting that the National Security Advisor had asked for clarification of certain language in the Section 505 Agreement governing end-use of bilateral military assistance, Fituri asked whether the U.S. had any further information. Drawing on ref a, DATT briefed Fituri on Article E of the standard Section 505 language, explaining that the clause was included to cover any possible future bilateral military assistance that could be provided under other legal authorities. DATT emphasized that this language did not in any way convey that the U.S. was promising additional new military assistance. Fituri said that he understood, and would brief the National Security Advisor on the issue.

<a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3. (C) Fituri also asked for an update on the list of military equipment requested by Muatassim al-Qadhafi during his April visit to the United States. DATT explained that the United States had briefed the National Security Advisor's officer repeatedly on the regulations governing Foreign Military Sales and the appropriate way forward. Noting that the U.S. was limited to non-lethal sales, the DATT suggested that the Libyan Government sign the pending Letters of Offer and Acceptance before initiating any new requests. Fituri agreed that this approach made sense, and said he hoped this topic could be included in any future political-military dialogue.

<a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4. (S) DCM noted that the U.S. also had been looking at topics to include in a future political-military dialogue, and had identified man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS) and humanitarian demining as potential areas of cooperation (ref b). A new partnership on eliminating the threat of MANPADS and eliminating Libya's landmine and UXO problem would advance our shared security goals and complement our existing security cooperation. Fituri said he was not familiar with either of these issues, but would brief Foreign Minister Musa Kusa. He asked that we convey ref b points in a diplomatic note, highlighting the possibility of expert-level discussions. DCM agreed to do so. CRETZ</pre></code>
