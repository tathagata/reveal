SUBJECT: UN OPERATION IN COTE D'IVOIRE:  CONSULTATIONS AND 
MANDATE RENEWAL 
 
REF: A. (A) STATE 54958 
     <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B. (B) STATE 41489

 <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1.  USUN may draw on the points in paragraph 2 for the July 
23 Security Council consultations on UNOCI and/or, as 
appropriate,  experts' discussions of the French draft 
resolution (not yet circulated for comment as of the date of 
this cable). 
 
<a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2.  Begin points: 
 
-- The United States thanks Ambassador Choi for his briefing. 
 We express our continuing support for the invaluable, 
tireless work being carried out by UNOCI personnel.  I would 
like also to express our appreciation to President Compaore 
for his facilitation of the Ouagadougou political process. 
 
-- We continue to urge the Ivorian parties to take the 
necessary steps to ensure that elections are held as scheduled 
in November.  Another postponement would be disheartening for 
the people of Cote d'Ivoire, who deserve the best 
from their leaders, and for Cote d'Ivoire's many 
international friends and partners.  The United States echoes 
the call 
in the Secretary-General's report for a detailed, endorsed 
timeline for key aspects of elections preparations. 
 
-- The United States appreciates the critical contribution 
Licorne is making to stability in Cote d'Ivoire.  We note 
that the 
discussions are ongoing about Licorne support for the 
elections and the possibility that UNMIL may be asked to 
reinforce 
UNOCI.  The Secretary-General's June 10 report on Liberia 
reported that once UNMIL has completed the third phase 
of drawdown, in May 2010, it will no longer be able to 
provide such contingency support.  This lends additional 
weight 
to the need for elections to be held as scheduled in 
November.  We hope that there will be more certainty by the 
time 
the next report is issued. 
 
-- While it is encouraging that the overall security 
situation remains stable, we remain concerned about violence, 
particularly against women and children.  We echo the 
Secretary-General's concerns about the fragile situation 
and community violence in the western part of the country. 
 
-- The United States would appreciate clarification of what 
is meant in the discussion of disarmament, 
demobilization and reintegration of former combatants and 
dismantling of the militias by " ... the role of 
the impartial forces in the supervision of weapons 
surrendered by the demobilized elements needs to be 
strengthened." 
 
-- We would also be interested in additional details on the 
redeployment of a police officer apiece from UNOCI and UNMIL 
to provide expert advice to UNOWA on crime and drug 
trafficking in the sub-region.  Please confirm that these 
officers 
will be under UNOWA's command during their redeployment. 
 
-- The U.S. supports extension of UNOCI's mandate until 
January 31, 2010, and looks forward to the 
Secretary-General's 
recommendations on an exit strategy for the mission. 
 
End points.
