SUBJECT: BRAZIL: RESPONSE TO DEMARCHE ON LEGACY PILOTS 

REF: (A) Brasilia 2425 (B) STATE 186511 Classified By: Classified by CG Simon Henshaw, reasons 1.5 b and (C) 

Ministry of External Relations Director for the Department of Brazilian Overseas Communities, Ambassador Manoel Gomes Pereira called CG November 21 to say he had contacted two of the justices hearing the pilots' appeal and passed on our concerns. He advised that no further action be taken until the ruling as the justices were sensitive to outside pressure.
