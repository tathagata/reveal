SUBJECT:  Icelandic Foreign Ministry welcomes DHS letter on 
Arnardottir Detention Case 
 
REF:  a) Reykjavik 336; b) Reykjavik 335 
 
<a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1.  The Ambassador delivered DHS Assistant Secretary for Policy 
Stewart Baker's letter regarding the Erla Osk Arnardottir case to 
Acting Foreign Minister Gretar Mar Sigurdsson on December 19. 
(Foreign Minister Gisladottir, to whom the letter is addressed, left 
the country this morning but will be forwarded the text.) 
Sigurdsson warmly welcomed DHS's thorough review of the 
circumstances of Arnardottir's detention at JFK Airport December 
9-10.  He took particular note of Secretary Baker's expression of 
regret for the circumstances of Ms. Arnardottir's treatment. 
Sigurdsson observed that from the point of view of the Icelandic 
government (and Ms. Arnardottir, who had discussed the incident with 
him) the most important message was DHS's commitment to reassess its 
current procedures in order to improve the treatment of visitors 
like Ms. Arnardottir.  Sigurdsson hoped this means that Ms. 
Arnardottir's unhappy experience will result in more appropriate 
treatment for future visitors to the U.S. 
 
<a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2.  In a subsequent phone conversation with Ms. Arnardottir, the 
Ambassador outlined the contents of the letter and invited her to 
visit the Embassy at her convenience to obtain the necessary visa. 
Ms. Arnardottir said that she had not brought her case to public 
attention out of spite or anger but to raise awareness of the 
existence of a problem at the U.S. border and to promote needed 
change.  She was pleased to learn that DHS would be reviewing their 
procedures in light of her experience.
