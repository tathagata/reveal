SUBJECT: UPDATE ON NATO AIR SURVEILLANCE AND TRAINING 
MISSIONS IN ICELAND 
 
Classified By: A/DCM W.S. Reid for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
<a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1.  (C) In November, the financial crisis in Iceland and the 
ensuing dispute between Iceland and the UK threw into 
question NATO air surveillance and training missions in 
Iceland.  The UK was scheduled to fill the December 5 ) 21, 
2008 rotation, but after a period of negotiation, the UK 
ultimately cancelled at the behest of the Icelandic 
government.  The negotiations also led to a reduction in the 
number of rotations per year and adjustments to the financial 
arrangements.  Sending nations are now invited to Iceland 
three times per year vice four.  The sending nations will 
also now pay for food at the rate of 26 euros per person per 
day, and ground support (handling fees, loading equipment, 
etc.) at the rate of 2,000 euros per day, assuming five jets 
-- cost that were covered previously by Iceland.  All other 
terms remain the same.  For 2009, the first rotation will be 
filled by Denmark beginning January, then Spain in the 
spring, followed by the United States in late August to 
September. 
 
<a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2.  (SBU) Iceland first invited NATO Allies to such air 
surveillance and policing activities in July 2007.  The 
initial exercise was conducted by France in April and May of 
<a id='par2008' href='#par2008'>¶</a>2008.  Not only do these rotations provide good training 
opportunities, they also demonstrate NATO presence in an area 
of Alliance airspace that has seen increased Russian 
encroachment.
