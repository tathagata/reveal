SUBJECT:  ICELAND WILL NOT HOST HAMAS 
 
REF:  (A) STATE 37552, (B) REYKJAVIK 50 
 
Post discussed ref A points with Icelandic MFA Head of 
International Institutions Division Nikulas Hannigan March 
<a id='par16' href='#par16'>Â¶</a>16.  Hannigan took note of U.S concerns about a Hamas 
government.  He assured us that Iceland has no plans to 
receive any member of Hamas.  Referring again to Arab 
revulsion at the Mohammed cartoons (ref B), Hannigan quipped 
that he did not believe Hamas planned any near-term visits 
to countries with crosses on their flags.  (Note:  An off- 
center cross is the chief feature of all Nordic flags.  End 
note.)
