<a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2. (U) In an August 4 meeting, MFA Americas Division Director Mohamed Al Matari gave the DCM a formal invitation from Foreign Minister-equivalent Musa Kusa for the Secretary to attend the Libyan Government's 40th anniversary celebration of Qadhafi's Al Fateh Revolution, planned for September 1 in Tripoli. DCM promised to convey the invitation to the Department. Original Arabic-language invitation was faxed to NEA/MAG on August 4; informal embassy translation of the invitation follows in para

<a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3. (C) The Libyan Government began a slow rollout of the 40th anniversary invitations around July 29, calling in individual embassies to receive personalized invitations. Several of our EU colleagues and the Japanese reported their governments have been invited to participate at the head of state level. We have heard that the Libyans approached the Italians some time ago to clarify when Berlusconi would visit Libya. The Libyans reportedly pushed for his attendance at the September 1 date when given the choice of his attending only one event (August 30 is also the first anniversary of the Libyan-Italian friendship treaty and the Libyans would have liked him there for that as well).

<a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4. (C) The MFA's Matari told us that he could not confirm at what level EU members had been invited but that some African and Latin American states -- "Libya's friends" -- had been invited at the head of state level. When asked why the U.S. was invited at the Ministerial level, Matari responded that the Libyan Government was certain that POTUS would not be able to attend.

<a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5. (C) Comment and Action Request: Qadhafi views the 40th anniversary celebration as the key moment in a year characterized by his and Libya's "achievements" in gaining international prominence. Rather than opt for what they knew was an almost certain negative response on POTUS attendance, they chose to invite the Secretary. They undoubtedly hope that the Secretary will attend to help them garner the respect and international legitimacy that they crave. The Department's guidance on how to respond to the invitation is requested.

<a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6. (U) Informal embassy translation of the invitation follows: TO: H.E. Secretary Hillary Clinton U.S. State Department Secretary Dear Secretary: On the first of September this year, the Libyan people are celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Great Al Fateh Revolution that delivered it from ignorance, poverty and backwardness, placed it on the track of progress and prosperity and enabled it to contribute actively in the efforts to consolidate peace, stability and security in all parts of the world. On this occasion celebrated by the Libyan people and the rest of free people in the world, we have the honor to invite your Excellency to attend the celebrations that will be held in Tripoli on September 1, 2009. We are fully confident that your acceptance of this invitation and attending these celebrations in person will be very much appreciated by the Libyan people, and would allow us the opportunity to discuss ways to develop bilateral relations between our two countries so as to achieve the common interests of our two friendly peoples in Libya and in the United States of America. Signature: Musa Kusa Secretary of the General People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation. July 30, 2009 CRETZ</pre></code>
