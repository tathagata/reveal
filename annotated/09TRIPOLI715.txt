REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The August 31 [ORG African Union  ] ( [ORG AU  ] ) [ORG Summit Extraordinary Session  ] held in [LOC Tripoli  ] produced two documents - the [ORG Tripoli Proclamation  ] and the [ORG Tripoli Work Plan  ] - aimed at resolving crises on the [MISC African  ] continent . 
[ORG Summit  ] attendees adhered to the wishes of the [MISC Ethiopian  ] and [MISC Eritrean  ] requests to not discuss their conflict in the context of [LOC Sudan  ] . 
Instead , delegates focused on expanding the mandate of [ORG AMISOM  ] to give it authority to patrol [MISC Somali  ] airspace and territorial waters . 
The [ORG Tripoli Work Plan  ] addressed relations between [LOC Chad  ] and [LOC Sudan  ] separate from the situation in [LOC Darfur  ] but did not result in any significant progress . 
The abrupt walk-out of [MISC Sudanese  ] President [PER Bashir  ] from his August 30 meeting with [PER Qadhafi  ] appears to have been the only news of note from the session , which most observers believe was scheduled primarily to kick off the September 1 celebration of [PER Qadhafi  ] 's coup . 
End Summary . 
SUMMIT WORK SESSIONS: [LOC GREAT LAKES  ] , [LOC DARFUR  ] , [LOC SOMALIA  ] 2 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The Special [ORG Summit  ] of the [ORG African Union  ] began with working-level meetings on the three focus areas for the session: the [LOC Great Lakes  ] , [LOC Darfur  ] , and [LOC Somalia  ] . 
The meetings were supposed to be held concurrently , with the [LOC Great Lakes  ] meeting a mile away from the site of the [LOC Darfur  ] and [LOC Somalia  ] meetings . 
The [ORG Executive Council  ] met only to set the agenda for the [ORG Assembly  ] 's meeting and made no substantive changes to the [ORG Tripoli Declaration or Plan of Work  ] . 
The final documents calling for resolution of [LOC Africa  ] 's hot crises were short on specific plans for action and metrics , with most of the text recalling and reiterating previously stated objectives . 
( [ORG Note: Post  ] has only obtained [MISC Arabic-language  ] versions of the final documents . 
End note . 
) 3 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) [ORG Summit  ] attendees mostly adhered to the wishes of the [MISC Ethiopian  ] and [MISC Eritrean  ] requests not to discuss their conflict in the context of [LOC Sudan  ] . 
Instead , delegates focused on expanding the mandate of [ORG AMISOM  ] to give it authority to patrol [MISC Somali  ] airspace and territorial waters . 
The [ORG Assembly  ] called for donor nations to stand up three additional battalions by the end of 2009 and for an international conference on the [ORG Horn of Africa  ] before the first quarter of 2010 . 
The overall mood was supportive of the [ORG Transitional Federal Government  ] ( [ORG TFG  ] ) and to expand participation in the [LOC Djibouti  ] Process . 
[MISC Somali  ] PM Sharmarke attended the [ORG Summit  ] on behalf of the [ORG TFG  ] , and [ORG AU Commission Chair  ] [PER Jean Ping  ] chaired the working group session on the 30th . 
4 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The [ORG Tripoli Plan of Work  ] addressed relations between [LOC Chad  ] and [LOC Sudan  ] separate from the situation in [LOC Darfur  ] . 
Delegates highlighted the need for a political resolution between [LOC Khartoum  ] and [LOC N'Djamena  ] and called for increased peacekeeping forces along the border region . 
In [LOC Darfur  ] , the [ORG Assembly  ] expressed pleasure that the security situation was improving and sought to increase cooperation with [ORG UN  ] missions in the region . 
The [ORG Assembly  ] also asked the [ORG Commission  ] to form election observation teams to deploy to [LOC Sudan  ] " before the elections " , but with no clear request on their numbers or depth of the mission . 
Despite rumors that [PER Qadhafi  ] would have [LOC Chad  ] and [LOC Sudan  ] sign an agreement to ease tension between the two countries , Presidents [PER Bashir  ] and Deby did not have face-to-face meetings . 
An [ORG EU  ] diplomat stationed in [LOC Khartoum  ] reported that [PER Bashir  ] walked out of an August 30 meeting with [PER Qadhafi  ] after an hour-long soliloquy by the Leader . 
However , an [MISC Egyptian  ] Poloff thought reports that [PER Bashir  ] was angry due to [PER Qadhafi  ] 's earlier remarks on [LOC South Sudan  ] 's secession were overblown , assessing that [PER Bashir  ] understood that [PER Qadhafi  ] was wont to ramble and that his actions were more important than his words . 
Rebel unification meetings held separately from the [ORG Summit  ] itself will be reported septel . 
5 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) On the [LOC Great Lakes  ] , delegates spoke of support for stabilization efforts between the [LOC DRC  ] , [LOC Burundi  ] , and [LOC Rwanda  ] but noted that more needed to be done to prevent the [PER Lord  ] 's [ORG Resistance Army  ] 's attempts to thwart further progress . 
An [MISC Arab  ] delegate told us plans for an international conference on development in [LOC Congo  ] and [LOC Burundi  ] were replaced for a [MISC Burundi-centric  ] conference due to simmering problems between the governments . 
The final Declaration also made short reference to earlier [ORG Assembly  ] and [ORG PSC  ] statements on internal crises in [LOC Guinea  ] , [LOC Madagascar  ] , [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] , [LOC Liberia  ] , [LOC Central African Republic  ] , [LOC Comoros  ] , and [LOC Western Sahara  ] ; though delegates in the closed session reported that little attention was given to the one-sentence statements . 
OPENING REMARKS REPEAT PREVIOUS THEMES TRIPOLI 00000715 002.2 OF 003 6 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The opening session began three hours late with relatively brief remarks from [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] and [ORG AU Commission  ] Chairman [PER Jean Ping  ] . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] used the theme of solving [MISC African  ] crises to promote his broader agenda of swift unification of [LOC Africa  ] 's political , military , and economic bodies into a [LOC United States  ] of [LOC Africa  ] . 
He described two types of conflicts: state-to-state belligerence and internal conflicts such as coups and rebellions . 
On the former , [PER Qadhafi  ] blamed [MISC European  ] colonial powers for drawing arbitrary lines across the continent , noting that abandoning the " artificial " borders in favor of a unified supranational body would instantly eliminate conflicts over borders and crises brought on by political divisions . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] was more coy on internal conflicts , maintaining that , from a legal standpoint , international bodies and third-party states had no right to interfere in the internal problems of another state . 
Rather , the role of the [ORG AU  ] should be to mediate between opposing factions in an effort to bring peace . 
However , if internal conflict were intensified by exogenous forces ( he provided the example of oil-thirsty foreign governments in [LOC Sudan  ] ) , then the [ORG AU  ] had a duty to intervene in a protective capacity . 
7 . 
( C ) [PER Chairperson Ping  ] 's remarks were detailed and anodyne . 
Quoting broadly from his 26-page report issued the week before the [ORG Summit  ] , he highlighted the achievements of the [ORG Peace and Security Council  ] in its first years of operation . 
However , with 20 internal conflicts within the past 20 years , 3 million of the world 's 10.5 million refugees , and 11.6 million of the 26 million [MISC IDPs  ] , [LOC Africa  ] still had much work to do . 
He three times thanked [LOC Libya  ] for its work to bring [ORG Peace and Security  ] issues to the fore , calling the [ORG Summit  ] 's work complimentary to the full implementation of the [ORG Continental Protocol on Peace and Security  ] , to be completed in 2010 . 
[PER Ping  ] made special note of the symbolic significance that brought the Special [ORG Summit  ] into being: the 40th anniversary of the coup that brought [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] to power and the 10th Anniversary of the [ORG Sirte  ] Proclamation in which [ORG Organization of African Unity  ] heads of state declared their intent to form the [ORG African Union  ] . 
[ORG SUMMIT ATMOSPHERICS: AFRICA  ] KISSES THE RING 8 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) [LOC Libya  ] 's management of event logistics was less organized than the three-day summit held in July ( ref A ) . 
A member of the [MISC Ugandan  ] delegation told P/E Chief that they were deposited at a dark hotel after being picked up at the airport on August 29 with no information on meeting times or locations . 
[MISC Libyan  ] protocol , which did not provide any information on how to obtain credentials until August 27 , faced lengthy backlogs at the [LOC Kabir Hotel  ] . 
[PER Guma Ibrahim Amer  ] , the [MISC Libyan  ] Assistant Secretary-equivalent for [MISC African Affairs  ] , spent an hour after the [LOC Great Lakes  ] work session shuttling high-ranking [MISC Africans  ] through the credentialing process . 
Observers were less lucky . 
After attending work sessions with badges held over from [ORG Sirte  ] , our delegation ( and [LOC China  ] 's ) was told no credentials would be coming on August 30 due to [LOC Iftar  ] and evening celebrations . 
Although the promised credentials never were issued , [MISC Emboffs  ] were able to attend as observers with other members of the diplomatic corps . 
The opening ceremony lasted just under an hour . 
As attendees filed out , [PER Qadhafi  ] invited the assembled to a cultural event later in the evening at [LOC Mitiga Air Base  ] . 
That event ( septel ) , however , focused entirely on the 40th anniversary of the coup that brought [PER Qadhafi  ] to power , marking a full transition from the [ORG AU Summit  ] to [MISC Libya-centric  ] themes . 
9 . 
( C ) As with [ORG Sirte  ] , [MISC Libyan  ] officials attempted to cover for lack of planning by spending lavishly on food and foreign event planning staff . 
The president of the [ORG Corinthia Hotel  ] told Poloff that five days before the [ORG Summit  ] , [MISC Libyan  ] Protocol had requested that the [ORG Corinthia Group  ] open an expatriate compound still under construction to house [ORG Summit  ] attendees . 
The work was so hurried , that the president himself was installing light bulbs and finishes to the apartments as late as August 29 . 
Similarly , a 333-room [LOC Radisson Hotel  ] across from the [ORG Summit  ] site was opened two months early to accommodate the influx . 
Despite these measures , many [MISC African  ] contacts grumbled about [LOC Libya  ] 's handling of the affair -- particularly when they viewed the [ORG Summit  ] as little more than a small piece of [PER Qadhafi  ] 's celebrations surrounding the September 1 anniversary of the coup that brought him to power . 
Still , several [MISC African  ] delegates acknowledged that they had little choice , with a member of the [MISC Ghanaian  ] delegation saying , " we know that nothing will happen [ because of decisions taken at the [ORG Summit  ] ] , but no one wants to make the Leader angry . 
" 10 . 
( C ) Comment: Short on substance and long on platitudes , this TRIPOLI 00000715 003.2 OF 003 extraordinary summit seemed to serve only as the opening event for [LOC Libya  ] 's 40th anniversary celebrations . 
Many observers cynically noted that the [ORG Summit  ] likely was called only to ensure an adequate number of heads of state was on-hand for the September 1 celebration . 
Most attendees nevertheless seemed content to go through the motions to give [PER Qadhafi  ] his day . 
End comment .
