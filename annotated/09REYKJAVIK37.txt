( [ORG SBU  ] ) Minister of [ORG Fisheries Steingrimur J. SigfuQon  ] announced on February 18 that his predecessor 's controversial increase in whaling quotas for fin and minke whales will stand at least for this year ( reftels ) . 
Ministry of [ORG Fisheries Head of the International Office  ] and [LOC Iceland  ] 's Commissioner to the [ORG International Whaling Commission  ] ( [ORG IWC  ] ) [PER Stefan Asmundsson  ] confirmed for [LOC Econoff  ] that no actual quotas have been issued yet ; quotas are devised by the annual scientific recommendations of the [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG Marine Research Institute  ] ( [ORG MRI  ] ) on sustainability and that information is not expected until late spring . 
However , [PER Asmundsson  ] said that one could make an educated guess on the numbers of the quota based on advice from previous years . 
( Note: Using the older [ORG MRI  ] information , this would mean a quota of 150 fin whales and 100 minke whales . 
End Note . 
) [PER Asmundsson  ] said the whalers do not have authority to start whaling until the quota is issued , but are probably making their preparations using the same educated guesses. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Director of [LOC Iceland  ] 's [ORG Nature Conservation Association  ] ( an anti-whaling NGO ) , [PER Arni Finsson  ] told [MISC Econoff  ] that he appreciated the strong language in the letter presented by the Ambassador and other representatives of the international community , but stressed that more was needed ( Ref A ) . 
He cited the 26 signatories to the letter denouncing [LOC Iceland  ] 's 2006 decision to continue whaling and related fin and minke whale quotas . 
[PER Finsson  ] said that the potential quota of 150 fins and 100 minkes this year was worse than the 2006 quota of nine fins and 30 minkes , and the response should reflect that increase . 
He mentioned that the [MISC British  ] supermarket chain [ORG Waitrose  ] had sent a letter to the [MISC Icelandic  ] authorities this week highlighting that their customers are not pro-whaling . 
[PER Finsson  ] said more responses like that would help pressure the [MISC Icelandic  ] authorities . 
He said more [ORG European Union  ] members and [ORG IWC  ] members from [LOC South America  ] should be approached about signing any joint international response. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Action Request and [ORG Comment: Post  ] believes a further response is necessary following the reaffirmation of the objectionable quota . 
We request [LOC U.S.  ] authorities issue a public statement deploring the decision as soon as possible . 
We also recommend that we either seek additional signatures to the letter delivered last week in [LOC Reykjavik  ] , or production of another one with at least the same number of countries signed up as did in 2006 .
