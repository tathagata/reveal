[ORG NEA READ OUT: A/S WELCH-SPANISH DG  ] [PER IRANZO  ] MEETING MADRID 00002809 001.2 OF 002 Classified By: A/DCM [PER Josie Shumake  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: One month after the [ORG UNGA  ] meeting between Assistant Secretary [PER Welch  ] and [ORG MFA DG  ] for [ORG Middle East/Africa  ] [PER Alvaro Iranzo  ] , [PER Iranzo  ] paid a call on the Ambassador October 26 , saying he had sought the meeting at FM [MISC Moratinos'  ] request , to reiterate that [LOC Spain  ] wishes to play a role in [LOC U.S.  ] strategic planning on [LOC Western Sahara  ] . 
[PER Iranzo  ] asked whether the [ORG GOS  ] could anticipate a response to the non-paper which he presented to [PER A/S Welch  ] at their [ORG UNGA  ] meeting . 
Foreign Minister [PER Moratinos  ] stuck to boilerplate language on [LOC Western Sahara  ] in recent testimony before the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG Congress  ] , and he denied a media report that [LOC Spain  ] is assisting [LOC Morocco  ] in crafting their autonomy plan . 
Post requests guidance on how to respond to [ORG MFA  ] 's non-paper . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG MFA DG for Middle East/Africa  ] [PER Alvaro Iranzo  ] called on the Ambassador on October 26 to discuss [LOC Western Sahara  ] . 
He said his visit to the Embassy was at the request of Foreign Minister [PER Miguel Angel Moratinos  ] , and he repeated the plea made to [ORG NEA A/S  ] [PER Welch  ] at their September meeting in [LOC New York  ] for greater [MISC US-Spain  ] coordination on [LOC Western Sahara  ] . 
[PER Iranzo  ] suggested that [LOC Spain  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] coordinate prior to bringing in other interested parties including the [LOC UK  ] and [LOC France  ] . 
[PER Iranzo  ] said [LOC Spain  ] welcomed the plan for a " technical rollover " of the [ORG MINURSO  ] mandate at the end of October but wished it had some reference to a broader political framework or negotiating strategy . 
In that respect , he mentioned the non-paper he presented to [PER A/S Welch  ] in [LOC New York  ] and asked whether [LOC Spain  ] would receive a response , as [PER A/S Welch  ] had indicated . 
The Ambassador told [PER Iranzo  ] he would relay the request to [LOC Washington  ] . 
[PER Iranzo  ] asked for Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] , s support in pressing [LOC Washington  ] for greater coordination with [LOC Spain  ] on this issue and said he had appreciated the meeting with [ORG A/S Welch.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Apart from this meeting , [PER Iranzo  ] called in [LOC PolCouns  ] on October 16 to convey the same message . 
[LOC PolCouns  ] noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] had put forward a framework that included pressure on [LOC Morocco  ] to produce a credible autonomy plan and negotiate directly with the [ORG Polisario  ] as soon as possible - with the continued threat that [ORG MINURSO  ] rollovers would no longer be a matter of course. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) On October 24 , Foreign Minister [PER Miguel Angel Moratinos  ] told the [ORG Congress  ] of Deputies that the relevant parties in the [LOC Western Sahara  ] dispute must continue negotiating and bring solution to the conflict . 
He said that the [ORG Zapatero  ] government " has tried , continues to try , and will continue trying to find a definitive solution to the [LOC Sahara  ] problem that is just , politically and mutually acceptable , and that permits the exercise of free self-determination for the [MISC Sahrawi  ] people . 
" [PER Moratinos  ] said he was sure that a consensus could be reached in [LOC New York  ] if the parties could agree on a plan . 
" What is missing is that the parties need to find the will to negotiate a solution within the structure of the [ORG United Nations  ] and its principles and resolutions . 
" At a joint press conference on October 31 , [PER Moratinos  ] denied a report published in [MISC Moroccan  ] magazine " [ORG Le Journal Hebdomadaire  ] " which claimed that [MISC Spanish  ] jurists are assisting [LOC Morocco  ] in drafting its autonomy plan for [LOC Western Sahara.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) [MISC Spanish  ] interest in [LOC Western Sahara  ] starts at the top . 
The [PER King  ] and Queen will visit [LOC Algeria  ] in early 2007 , and the King recently met with [LOC Morocco  ] 's King [PER Mohamed VI  ] . 
The [ORG Polisario Front  ] sent a letter to King [PER Juan Carlos  ] on October 12 asking him to intervene on their behalf with the [MISC Moroccan  ] monarch . 
[MISC Mauritanian  ] President [PER Ely Ould Mohamed Vall  ] just made his first visit to [LOC Spain  ] , along with a host of ministers . 
His visit coincided with that of [MISC Algerian  ] Foreign Minister [PER Mohamed Bedjaoui  ] , though post is unaware of any connection. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [MISC COMMENT:  ] The [MISC Spanish  ] non-paper declares the " unfeasibility " of any regionally acceptable solution while [LOC Algeria  ] and [LOC Morocco  ] remain at each other 's throats . 
It is also clearly colored by and suggests a solution similar to the approach which [LOC Spain  ] has taken with its own region of [LOC Catalonia  ] . 
That is , abandoning " decolonization " vocabulary such as sovereignty and independence in favor of " globalization " vocabulary such as regionalization , autonomy , and self-rule ( page 9 ) . 
[LOC Spain  ] 's reliance on [MISC Algerian  ] natural MADRID 00002809 002.2 OF 002 gas and on [MISC Moroccan  ] labor , trade and CT cooperation puts it in the awkward position of having to maintain good relations with both nations . 
[LOC Spain  ] 's national interest clearly lies with resolving this dispute , opening the [MISC Morocco-Algeria  ] border , and engaging a regionally integrated [MISC North African  ] economy .
