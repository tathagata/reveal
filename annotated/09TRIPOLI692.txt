REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) In an August 26 meeting , [MISC Libyan  ] Protocol Chief and [PER Qadhafi  ] confidante [PER Nuri  ] al-Mismari pressed [PER A/DCM  ] for information on who would " replace " the Secretary at [LOC Libya  ] 's September 1 celebration of the 40th anniversary of [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] 's coup . 
[PER Mismari  ] asserted that he had " made the Leader [ [PER Qadhafi  ] ] understand that Secretary [PER Clinton  ] not attending is not an insult , but please do not send just some low-level representative , as he will take that badly . 
" Striking a conspiratorial tone , [PER Mismari  ] advised that the [LOC U.S.  ] should send " at least an assistant secretary or deputy " in order to " keep things on the right footing . 
" [PER A/DCM  ] replied that the issue of USG representation was currently being discussed in [LOC Washington  ] . 
[ Note: We had transmitted the [ORG Department  ] 's letter to FM Kusa , declining the Secretary 's invitation to the September 1 festivities , in an August 12 meeting with A/S-equivalent [PER Ahmed Fituri  ] . 
At that time , [PER Fituri  ] told us that he understood the Secretary 's decision and commented that it would be better for senior officials to come at a different time , when there would be greater opportunities for substantive talks . 
] 2 . 
( C ) [PER Mismari  ] , raising the topic himself , noted that he was " fairly confident " that convicted [PER Pan Am  ] 103 bomber [PER Abdel Basset  ] al-Megrahi would not be in attendance at the September 1 celebrations . 
" I think we have taken care of that issue , " he said . 
[PER Mismari  ] also raised [PER Qadhafi  ] 's accommodations during his upcoming visit to the [LOC US  ] . 
Commenting that , " we fully understand that [LOC New Jersey  ] is unworkable , " he said the problem was now finding " appropriate " lodging in [LOC Manhattan  ] , as [PER Qadhafi  ] " will not use elevators , and cannot walk up more than 35 stairs , so we must find a hotel that has a suite on the first floor . 
" 3 . 
( SBU ) [PER Mismari  ] provided an [MISC Arabic  ] copy of the official [ORG GOL  ] schedule of events for September 1 ; Embassy 's translation has been sent via unclassified e-mail to NEA/MAG .
