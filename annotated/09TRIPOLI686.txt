[PER MEGRAHI  ] WELCOMED WITH A WARM EMBRACE <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Libyan  ] leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] met convicted [MISC Pan Am 103  ] bomber [PER Abdel Bassett  ] al-Megrahi on August 21 , in [LOC Megrahi’s  ] hometown of [LOC Sebha  ] . 
[ Note: [PER Qadhafi  ] had traveled to [LOC Sebha  ] on August 19 to review some economic projects , and apparently stayed there until the August 21 meeting . 
End note . 
] The widely televised meeting , preceded by a warm embrace between [PER Qadhafi  ] and [PER Megrahi  ] , also included several poems expressing congratulations to [PER Qadhafi  ] on the 40th anniversary of the “Great al-Fatah Revolution , ” on the start of [LOC Ramadan  ] , and for “the return home of brother , [PER Abdel Basset  ] al-Megrahi.” [PER Qadhafi  ] delivered remarks to local and international press after his tete-a-tete with [PER Megrahi  ] , which he addressed to “friends” and “those who objected to these friends.” [PER Qadhafi  ] thanked the [ORG Scottish Government  ] , including the PM and FM , for their “courage , ” stating that they “have proven to be independent in spite of all unnecessary and unacceptable pressure they faced.” He went on to thank his “friend Brown , ” the [MISC British  ] Prime Minister , his government , Queen [PER Elizabeth  ] , and Prince [PER Andrew  ] , who “against all odds encouraged this brave decision.” [PER Qadhafi  ] noted that the [LOC UK  ] efforts would positively affect “exchange” between the two countries. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Addressing “the other side , ” [PER Qadhafi  ] derided comments that the USG had made concerning the sensitivity of [MISC Megrahi’s  ] release to the families of [LOC Lockerbie  ] victims , stating “Are we without feelings , and they have feelings ? 
Are we donkeys and they are humans ? ” [PER Qadhafi  ] referred to the [LOC U.S.  ] opposition to [MISC Megrahi’s  ] release as “double standard politics , ” calling it “encroachment” and “arrogance” and “contempt for other nations , their public opinion , and humanity.” [PER Qadhafi  ] further stated that the [LOC U.S.  ] position was responsible for injustice and terrorism . 
He said , “Terrorism has its justifications , which is double standard politics.” [MISC MEGRAHI’S  ] RELEASE AND [LOC UK  ] BUSINESS DEALS <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) On August 20 Qadhafi’s son and potential successor to the throne , [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi issued a statement through his quasi-governmental organization , the [ORG Qadhafi International and Charity Foundation  ] , praising his own efforts and success in achieving [MISC Megrahi’s  ] release from prison . 
He thanked the [MISC Scottish  ] and [MISC British  ] governments and stated that the friendship between [LOC Libya  ] and both nations would be “forever consolidated.” [PER Saif  ] al-Islam went on to address the families of [LOC Lockerbie  ] victims , saying that although [PER Megrahi  ] withdrew his appeal , his innocence would one day be proved . 
During [PER Saif  ] al-Islam’s remarks to his new television station “Al Mutawassit” August 20 , which were reprinted August 21 in state-owned newspaper “Oya , ” he linked [MISC Megrahi’s  ] release to [LOC UK  ] business contracts , asserting that [MISC Megrahi’s  ] case was raised during all negotiations of [LOC UK-Libya  ] commercial , oil , and gas deals . 
[PER Saif  ] al-Islam implied that former [LOC UK  ] PM [PER Tony Blair  ] had raised [PER Megrahi  ] with the [MISC Libyan  ] leader in connection with lucrative business deals during Blair’s 2007 visit to [LOC Libya  ] . 
[ Note: Rumors that [PER Blair  ] made linkages between [MISC Megrahi’s  ] release and trade deals have been longstanding among Embassy contacts . 
End note . 
] The [LOC UK  ] Ambassador in [LOC Tripoli  ] categorically denied the claims during a conversation with the Charge August 21 . 
He also stated that the [MISC British  ] government was reconsidering its decision to send Prince [PER Andrew  ] to September 1 events in [LOC Libya  ] . 
PREPARING FOR A GRANDER AFFAIR ? <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) While the [PER Qadhafi  ] family and government officials have not had any public interaction with or comment on [PER Megrahi  ] since the September 21 meeting , banners are being unfurled in [LOC Tripoli’s Green Square  ] - the site of the upcoming 40th anniversary celebrations - hailing [MISC Megrahi’s  ] homecoming and the [MISC Libyan  ] leader’s support of his release . 
Rumors among Embassy contacts suggest that [PER Megrahi  ] will be honored officially by [PER Qadhafi  ] during the 40th anniversary events . 
The state-run “Al Watan” website claimed that the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG People’s Congress  ] would award [PER Megrahi  ] a medal of honor for his “bravery and patience” in turning himself over to the “states of international arrogance” for the sake of his nation. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Comment: Qadhafi’s personal , warm welcome of [PER Megrahi  ] and strongly worded statement critical of [LOC U.S.  ] opposition to [MISC Megrahi’s  ] release are a powerful indication of the importance that [PER Qadhafi  ] attaches to the issue . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] likely viewed [MISC Megrahi’s  ] return as vital to his own domestic politics: a boon to the influential [PER Megrahi  ] tribe and , more importantly , a major victory for the hardliners who have been critical of his engagement with the [LOC West  ] . 
Qadhafi’s very public , personal involvement in this issue will complicate the efforts of pragmatic [MISC Libyan  ] officials seeking to manage the fallout from [MISC Megrahi’s  ] return , as they now have very little political cover to make the case for a muted response . 
We continue to monitor the situation .
