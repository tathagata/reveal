( [ORG SBU  ] ) We warmly welcome your visit to the [LOC Netherlands  ] , the first by an Attorney General since Attorney General Aschroft visited in September 2004 . 
There are four important issues where you can advance our law enforcement agenda: ( 1 ) [PER Establish  ] a strong working relationship with new Minister of Justice [PER Ernst Hirsch Ballin  ] ; ( 2 ) Launch a new bilateral dialogue on cyber crime , a major issue for both us and the [MISC Dutch  ] ; ( 3 ) Review with [ORG Eurojust  ] the new relationship we will have as a result of our recently negotiated MOU ; and ( 4 ) Engage in robust press outreach that emphasizes our common goals and answers our many critics here . 
Accordingly , your schedule is built around a working lunch with Minister [PER Hirsch Ballin  ] , meetings with Interior Minister [PER Remkes  ] and [ORG Eurojust  ] president [PER Kennedy  ] , and your welcoming address to the cyber crime conference . 
We have also scheduled a press conference , a television interview and a one-on-one interview with the best weekly magazine in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
Overview -------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Dutch Parliamentary  ] elections will be held on November 22 . 
The race appears to be a dead heat between Prime Minister [PER Jan Peter Balkenende  ] 's center-right coalition and the left-of-center [ORG Labor  ] party . 
[PER Balkenende  ] came to power in 2001 , but his government collapsed in August over a dispute regarding [MISC Dutch  ] Parliamentarian [PER Aayan Hirsi Ali  ] 's asylum application . 
The [MISC Somali-born  ] politician - a vocal critic of extreme [MISC Islam  ] - is now in the [LOC United States  ] with the [ORG American Enterprise Institute  ] . 
How to provide her adequate protection in [LOC Washington  ] is the subject of continuing discussions between us and the [MISC Dutch  ] , and the issue may come up during your visit as [PER Hirsch Ballin  ] is the key [MISC Dutch  ] decision maker on this issue. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Aside from the elections , the most significant news here is the [MISC Dutch  ] economy , which has come to life in recent months . 
Current projections show the economy growing at a rate of nearly 3 percent with unemployment falling below 5.5 percent . 
The economy is outperforming Eurozone averages for the first time in seven years. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Our relations with the [MISC Dutch  ] are excellent , aside from [LOC Guantanamo  ] and negative public opinion of [LOC Iraq  ] and other policies . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] are strong allies in the [MISC Global War  ] on Terrorism , and currently have nearly 2,000 troops deployed in the heart of southern [LOC Afghanistan  ] , where the [ORG Taliban  ] are seeking to make a comeback . 
A [MISC Dutch  ] contingent also served in the early stages of the [LOC Iraq  ] war . 
Although they do not approve of our policies at [LOC Guantanamo  ] , they are one of the few [MISC European  ] countries engaging in serious dialogue on the issue with us . 
Commercial relations are strong , with heavy [LOC U.S.  ] investment in the [LOC Netherlands  ] and heavy [MISC Dutch  ] investment in the [LOC United States  ] . 
In your meetings and public remarks it will be important to emphasize the breadth of our cooperation and how much we value the [LOC Netherlands  ] as a partner. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Law enforcement cooperation is good and getting better . 
While [MISC Dutch  ] and [ORG EU  ] data protection ( privacy ) rules and bureaucratic restrictions continue to hamper some direct police-to-police cooperation and information sharing , we have made significant progress in the last two years to advance our law enforcement priorities with the [MISC Dutch  ] . 
We expect interim Justice Minister [PER Hirsch Ballin  ] to continue former Minister [PER Piet Hein Donner  ] 's pro-cooperation approach with us . 
Law Enforcement Presence ------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Our law enforcement presence here has tripled since 9/11 and now constitutes a strong platform for our extensive law enforcement and counter-terrorism agenda with the [MISC Dutch  ] , and for our nascent relationship with [ORG EUROPOL  ] and [ORG Eurojust  ] . 
Four [LOC U.S.  ] law enforcement agencies operate from the [ORG Embassy  ] , and represent 10 percent of the entire mission staff . 
-- [ORG DEA:  ] The six-person office focuses on cocaine and ecstasy trafficking and works closely with the [MISC Dutch  ] and other [ORG DEA  ] offices in [LOC Europe  ] and [LOC South America  ] . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] are facilitating information sharing and allowing some controlled delivery operations for the first time . 
The [ORG DEA  ] office here is tied with [LOC Madrid  ] as the largest in [MISC Western  ] THE HAGUE 00002277 002.2 OF 005 [LOC Europe  ] . 
-- [ORG FBI:  ] The bureau is represented by a Special Agent who was permanently assigned to The [ORG Hague  ] in October 2005 . 
Since his arrival , there has been a dramatic increase in the level of cooperation between [MISC Dutch  ] national police ( [ORG KLDP  ] ) and intelligence service ( [ORG AIVD  ] ) on information and intelligence sharing , cooperation on international investigations , and the initiation of joint investigations . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] have requested [ORG FBI  ] assistance in cases ranging from the [ORG Hofstad Group  ] ( a home-grown terrorist cell ) to the [PER Natalee Holloway  ] disappearance in [LOC Aruba  ] . 
The [PER Legatt  ] has direct access to the [ORG KLPD  ] 's counterterrorism unit , allowing him to be involved in all criminal counter-terrorism investigations . 
Counter- terrorism and cyber crime are the two largest parts of [ORG FBI  ] 's portfolio here . 
-- [ORG DHS: Homeland Security  ] is the largest [LOC U.S.  ] law enforcement agency in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
[ORG DHS  ] officers are stationed at the [ORG Port of Rotterdam  ] and [ORG Schiphol Airport  ] to scan cargo and check passengers destined for the [LOC United States  ] . 
[ORG DHS  ] has 14 staff in the [LOC Netherlands  ] , with plans to add at least two more in the coming year . 
The [ORG DHS  ] office covers [LOC Belgium  ] and [LOC Luxembourg  ] in addition to the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
-- Secret Service: The service has one special agent stationed at [ORG EUROPOL  ] with a primary focus on counterfeit currency . 
His relations with [ORG EUROPOL  ] colleagues are excellent . 
The office was established in 2005 . 
-- The [ORG Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives Agency  ] is planning to assign an officer here starting in FY 2007 . 
The [ORG Postal Inspection Service  ] has also expressed interest in establishing a presence here . 
Counter Terrorism ----------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Dutch  ] have strengthened their counter-terrorism capabilities since 9/11 in three significant ways . 
First , they passed tough new legislation that provided new counter- terrorism tools for police and prosecutors , increased penalties for crimes committed with " " terrorist intent , " " made conspiracy to commit a terrorist offense a crime , and criminalized financial support for banned terrorist organizations on [ORG UN  ] and [ORG EU  ] asset freeze lists . 
As of January 1 , 2005 , every person over the age of 14 in the [LOC Netherlands  ] is obligated to carry valid identification and the police can demand that identification at any time . 
More recent legislation has given prosecutors the ability to introduce classified material and sources into court proceedings , and expanded the ability of law enforcement agencies to share data . 
The conviction of nine members of the [ORG Hofstad  ] group in March marked the first successful prosecution in the [LOC Netherlands  ] for membership in a terrorist organization , under 2004 legislation making such membership a criminal offence. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As with us , new terrorism laws have been accompanied by increased attention to immigration . 
Backlash about a growing immigrant population helped bring [PER Balkenende  ] to power in 2001 . 
New immigration laws are very strict and include a requirement for immigrant visa applicants to pass an exam on [MISC Dutch  ] history and culture and to learn [MISC Dutch  ] . 
The exam was so difficult that many [MISC Dutch  ] natives failed the exam . 
As a result of these strict laws , immigration is significantly down . 
The number of foreign marriage partners and children immigrating to the [LOC Netherlands  ] has fallen by 50 percent over the past two years. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Second , the [MISC Dutch  ] created a new agency specifically charged with coordinating counter-terrorism policy: The Office of the [ORG National Counter Terrorism Coordinator  ] ( [ORG NCTB  ] ) reports jointly to [PER Hirsch Ballin  ] and [ORG Remkes  ] . 
It became operational in January 2005 and is mandated with coordinating counter-terrorism efforts , including facilitating cooperation among the police , intelligence and prosecution services . 
Like all new government agencies , the [ORG NCTB  ] suffers from unclear lines of authority . 
The [ORG CT Coordinator  ] , [PER Tjibbe Joustra  ] , reports to both the Justice Minister , the designated coordinating minister for counterterrorism , and the Interior Minister , who oversees the police and the [ORG AIVD  ] domestic intelligence service . 
The THE HAGUE 00002277 003.2 OF 005 merger of the Justice and Interior ministries into one " " super ministry " " for security was proposed in 2005 , but consideration of the idea has been deferred until the new government takes office . 
In addition to creating the [ORG NCTB  ] the [MISC Dutch  ] have significantly expanded their military and civilian intelligence bureaus. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Third , the [MISC Dutch  ] have greatly expanded cooperation with the [LOC United States  ] , [LOC Britain  ] and others . 
They have been strong partners with us on border security initiatives , and were the first in [LOC Europe  ] to host [ORG DHS  ] 's [ORG Container Security Initiative  ] ( [ORG CSI  ] ) and the [ORG Immigration Advisory Program  ] . 
[ORG Schiphol Airport  ] was willing to share passenger data with us , even in the face of [ORG EU  ] criticism . 
The [ORG Port of Rotterdam  ] was also criticized by the [ORG EU  ] for being the first to adopt [ORG CSI  ] ; other [MISC European  ] ports claimed it was an unfair trade advantage. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The government 's quarterly terrorist threat assessment released October 16 maintained the threat level at " " substantial , " " the second highest of four threat levels . 
Substantial is defined as a " " realistic threat of an attack " " in the [LOC Netherlands  ] or on [MISC Dutch  ] interests abroad . 
The report highlights continuing concern about radicalization among the [MISC Dutch  ] [MISC Muslim  ] population as a factor in the assessment . 
The [MISC Muslim  ] community in the [LOC Netherlands  ] is the second largest in [LOC Europe  ] as a percentage of the population ( 5.8 percent ) , and is one of the least well integrated in [LOC Europe  ] . 
Counter Narcotics ----------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) We have made significant strides in counter narcotics cooperation with the [MISC Dutch  ] . 
[ORG DEA  ] has successfully co-located special agents in two [MISC KLDP National Crime Squad  ] ( [ORG NR  ] ) units , dealing with cocaine and synthetic drug investigations . 
Co-location has greatly enhanced effective cooperation , in particular police-to-police intelligence sharing , and has helped to link [MISC Dutch  ] drug investigations to major ongoing [ORG DEA  ] international operations . 
Since 2005 , [ORG DEA  ] has been able to conduct controlled delivery ( CD ) operations without a formal [MISC MLAT  ] request. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Our main concern over the past five years has been stemming the flood of ecstasy from the [LOC Netherlands  ] to the [LOC United States  ] . 
Through combined efforts by [ORG DEA  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] authorities , the number of ecstasy tablets seized in the [LOC United States  ] that could be traced to the [LOC Netherlands  ] dropped from over 5 million a year in the early 2000s to roughly 200,000 in 2004 . 
[MISC Dutch  ] efforts against ecstasy were commended by President [PER Bush  ] in the 2006 [ORG International Narcotics Control Strategy Report  ] ( [ORG INCSR  ] ) . 
Cooperation against synthetic drug trafficking will likely remain our top focus in the foreseeable future. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Police-to-police sharing goes both ways with the [MISC Dutch  ] . 
As a result of the October 2004 MOU between the [ORG KLDP  ] and the [ORG El Paso Intelligence Center  ] ( [ORG EPIC  ] ) , the [ORG KLDP  ] can now run intelligence checks through the [ORG EPIC Watch Center  ] 24 hours a day ; the KLPD is the only [MISC European  ] police agency with such access . 
[ORG EPIC  ] access has helped foster closer police-to-police intelligence sharing . 
For example , the [MISC Dutch  ] have agreed to share names on the " " blacklist " " of drug couriers arrested at [LOC Schiphol  ] airport ; as a result , over 6,000 drug couriers have been entered into [ORG DEA  ] databases . 
Since May 2005 , the [MISC Dutch  ] have participated in [ORG DEA  ] 's [ORG International Drug Enforcement Conference  ] ( [ORG IDEC  ] ) as observers ; they will become a full [ORG IDEC  ] member at the next conference in [LOC Madrid  ] in May 2007 . 
Cyber Crime ----------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The bilateral cyber crime conference that you will open with [PER Hirsch Ballin  ] and the Ambasasdor on October 26 will bring together 40 [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] policy-makers , prosecutors and police for in-depth discussions on effective approaches to combating cyber crime . 
In addition to detailed discussions of mechanisms for effective cooperation on cyber crime , the conference will include sessions on combating use of the [MISC Internet  ] for child pornography , terrorism and radicalization , and scams and frauds . 
[LOC U.S  ] delegates include [ORG DOJ  ] prosecutors , cyber crime and international affairs experts , and [ORG FBI  ] , [ORG Secret Service  ] , and [ORG DHS  ] officials . 
THE HAGUE 00002277 004.2 OF 005 <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Long the gateway to [LOC Europe  ] via sea and air , the [LOC Netherlands  ] is quickly becoming a digital gateway as well . 
It now tops the world in broadband internet penetration , along with [LOC South Korea  ] . 
Because of the high connectivity of the country , the [MISC Dutch  ] allocate substantial energy to combating child pornography , internet radicalization and on- line scams and frauds . 
The [ORG National Prosecutor  ] just released a four-year strategy that identifies cyber crime as one of his four priority law enforcement areas . 
The [ORG FBI  ] Legatt spends nearly half his time working on cyber crime cases . 
The national police are forming a new high tech crime squad to investigate complex cyber crime cases . 
[MISC Dutch  ] prosecutors uncovered and are in the process of prosecuting one of the largest hacking cases to date . 
Cases like these will be discussed during the conference and help both countries develop a better understanding of what is required to combat cyber crime . 
Extraditions ------------ <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) We have an active extradition portfolio with the [MISC Dutch  ] that generally runs smoothly , although sometimes slowly . 
Extraditions cover a wide array of crimes , many drug-related . 
So far this year , 8 suspects have been extradited . 
Two high-profile cases merit your attention , the first involving a terror suspect , the second involving a well-known [MISC Dutch  ] business executive whom we have indicted on corruption charges. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The terror case concerns Iraqi-born [MISC Dutch  ] citizen [PER Wesam Al Delaema  ] . 
[PER Al Delaema  ] is the first individual to be indicted in a [LOC U.S.  ] criminal case for terrorist activities -- conspiracy to kill [LOC U.S.  ] citizens and bomb [LOC U.S.  ] property -- in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
On October 11 , Justice Minister [PER Hirsch Ballin  ] approved the extradition to the [LOC U.S.  ] of [PER Al Delaema  ] . 
In the extradition order , the Minister strongly refuted allegations by the defense and some opposition parliamentarians that , as a terror suspect , [PER Al Delaema  ] would not get a fair trail in the [LOC U.S.  ] Specifically , the Minister indicated he saw no reason " " not to trust the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" " to meet its commitments . 
[PER Al Delaema  ] 's attorney has filed a request for an injunction against the extradition order . 
We expect the Court to reject the request ; resolution of the case will likely take two to three months , after which [PER Al Delaema  ] can be extradited. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The well-connected [MISC Dutch  ] business executive , [PER Frederik Pluimers  ] , was indicted in the [LOC U.S.  ] on Foreign Corrupt [ORG Practices Act  ] violations . 
Although the [ORG Dutch Supreme Court  ] in 2003 cleared the way for his extradition , the government has not taken any action to complete his extradition . 
[PER Pluimers  ] is wanted , in his capacity as the director of the [LOC U.S.  ] subsidiary of [ORG Seybolt International  ] , in connection with bribes paid to [MISC Panamanian  ] officials in 1995 . 
[PER Pluimers  ] is very well regarded in [MISC Dutch  ] business and political circles , however , and former Justice Minister [PER Donner  ] deferred action on his extradition in light of opposition from fellow Cabinet ministers . 
Foreign Minister [PER Bot  ] wrote former Deputy Secretary of State [PER Zoellick  ] in late 2005 to request that the USG drop its extradition request for [PER Pluimers  ] ; following interagency consultation , [PER Zoellick  ] responded that we would not drop the request . 
There has been no further action on the case . 
Detainee Issues --------------- <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Dutch  ] in general strongly oppose our detainee policies and [LOC Guantanamo  ] , although we are making progress convincing them that the issues are far more complex than is often portrayed in public debates . 
Foreign Minister [PER Bot  ] has called for the closure of [LOC Guantanamo  ] , insisting detainees there are in a legal black hole . 
He has also condemned the use of secret prisons . 
In response to parliamentary demands , he called at the [ORG EU  ] Foreign Ministers meeting in September for a resolution condemning the secret sites . 
He has offered [MISC Dutch  ] assistance in developing a detainee policy that satisfies international legal norms as the [MISC Dutch  ] see them . 
[ORG State Department Legal Advisor  ] [PER John Bellinger  ] visited the [LOC Netherlands  ] October 10-12 to discuss detainee policy , the recently-passed [ORG Military Commissions Act  ] , [LOC U.S.  ] interpretations of our obligations under international law , and the future of secret detention facilities . 
Justice THE HAGUE 00002277 005.2 OF 005 Minister [PER Hirsch Ballin  ] met with [PER Bellinger  ] and displayed an appreciation for the challenges we face , and may raise the issue during your meeting with him . 
Your Meeting with Justice Minister [PER Hirsch Ballin  ] --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Ernst Hirsch Ballin  ] took office September 21 , following the resignation of [PER Piet Hein Donner  ] as Justice Minister over charges that he was negligent in not preventing a 2005 fire at a [LOC Schipol Airport  ] detention center that killed several illegal immigrants . 
[PER Hirsch Ballin  ] served previously as Justice Minister from 1989 to 1994 . 
He is a distinguished law professor with a background in international law . 
Your working lunch with him provides an opportunity to establish ties with the new Minister and to express appreciation for improved bilateral law enforcement cooperation . 
It would also be useful to thank him for the strong affirmation of trust in the [LOC U.S.  ] justice system he presented in the [PER Al Delaema  ] extradition order , and to press him to move expeditiously on it once appeals are exhausted . 
You should also thank him for [MISC Dutch  ] efforts to combat the ecstasy trade . 
Your Meeting with Interior Minister [PER Remkes  ] ------------------------------------------ <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Interior Minister [PER Remkes  ] is responsible for crisis management and oversees the police and the domestic intelligence service . 
His role in setting law enforcement and counter terrorism policy is limited . 
Your meeting offers an opportunity to express appreciation for the improved direct police-to-police cooperation in combating terrorism , narcotics and organized crime . 
Your Meeting with [ORG Eurojust  ] President [PER Kennedy  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Your meeting with [ORG Eurojust  ] President [PER Michael Kennedy  ] offers an opportunity to inaugurate a new relationship between the [ORG DOJ  ] and [ORG Eurojust  ] . 
That relationship will be formally initiated during the November signing of a working agreement between [ORG MOJ  ] and [ORG Eurojust  ] . 
You can use your meeting to focus on how best to utilize the new relationship and how to focus on critical enforcement areas . 
This is also an opportunity to look forward to cooperation on implementing the [ORG Council of Europe  ] cyber crime convention . 
Press ----- <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) We are working to arrange a press roundtable , a television interview , and a longer human-interest interview with a journalist from the [LOC Netherlands  ] 's most influential weekly newsmagazine . 
We are working to arrange a press pool to cover your and [MISC Dutch  ] Minister of Justice 's opening remarks at the conference . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] media will be interested to learn about the outcomes of your meetings . 
This is a good opportunity to highlight bilateral law enforcement cooperation and commend progress made thus far . 
Journalists will also be interested in hearing about our War on Terror . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] press is generally fair in its reporting and your visit should produce some great coverage that will help spread our messages to a broad audience.</pre></code>
