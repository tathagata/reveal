COMMENT ------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The regime 's blocking of at least 27 youth activists follows the same pattern as the week before , when the [ORG GOC  ] prevented at least 22 dissidents from attending the February 23 closure of the " [ORG Congress  ] " of independent librarians affiliated with [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
The latest crackdown underlines the regime 's sensitivity over political activities by the country 's youth , who are largely disenfranchised , frustrated and eager for change .
