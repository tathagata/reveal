[ORG IIR  ] 6 902 9642 06 [LOC CARACAS  ] 00000958 001.2 OF 005 Classified By: POLITICAL COUNSELOR ROBERT R. DOWNES FOR 1.4 ( D ) ------- Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S//NF ) Manifest in the public rhetoric of both countries , a shared hatred for the USG is the driving factor in the budding relationship between [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
The [ORG BRV  ] is favoring [LOC Iran  ] with petroleum deals and other contracts that appear to make little commercial sense . 
Although rumors of [LOC Venezuela  ] 's cooperation with an [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear weapons program appear baseless , [LOC Iran  ] and [MISC Venezuelan  ] spokesmen have announced their intention to develop [LOC Venezuela  ] 's civilian nuclear capabilities . 
Press reports and Embassy contacts suggest [LOC Venezuela  ] is preparing to try to exploit its own uranium deposits with [LOC Iran  ] 's assistance . 
Sensitive reporting indicates [LOC Venezuela  ] may also be seeking armaments , cooperation on maintaining aircraft purchased from the [LOC United States  ] , and help in training its military reserves . 
Post will continue to monitor the relationship while seeking to exploit [LOC Venezuela  ] 's missteps as it isolates itself from countries alarmed about [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear ambitions . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] have been signing bilateral agreements galore . 
[MISC Iranian  ] parliamentary speaker [PER Gholam-Ali Haddad Adel  ] told the press during his visit to [LOC Caracas  ] in mid-February that the two countries had signed 100 accords . 
[MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Mohammad Khatami  ] and [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Hugo Chavez  ] inked twenty of these together in March 2005 , including plans to cooperate in petrochemical , agricultural , and housing projects . 
[LOC Venezuela  ] often signs agreements to show off its importance on the world stage without following through . 
Yet , in the case of [LOC Iran  ] , there appears to be more to the budding relationship than show . 
Below we examine several possible explanations for the bilateral coziness , in rough order of importance. -------- Ideology -------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Iran  ] shares a disdain for the [ORG U.S. Government  ] that the [ORG BRV  ] seeks in its foreign allies . 
[PER Chavez'  ] ill-defined , left-wing , anti-American ideology often drives his foreign policy decisions , even when his foreign counterparts only appear to be seeking commercial benefits . 
With [LOC Iran  ] , however , he has found a partner that shares his desire to try to face down the [LOC United States  ] . 
Evident in his daily rhetoric , [PER Chavez'  ] ideology--and his accompanying attempts to use it to stir up his political base--best explain his decision to isolate himself from much of the world by supporting [LOC Iran  ] . 
( [LOC Venezuela  ] joined only [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] in voting February 4 to oppose [LOC Iran  ] 's referral to the [ORG U.N. Security Council  ] for its involvement in uranium enrichment . 
) [PER Chavez  ] , who regularly alleges the [LOC U.S.  ] military has stolen [LOC Iraq  ] 's oil , has accused [LOC Washington  ] of having designs on [LOC Iran  ] 's supply . 
Other [ORG BRV  ] officials have taken [PER Chavez'  ] ideological cue to the point of making [LOC Venezuela  ] appear [LOC CARACAS  ] 00000958 002.2 OF 005 fanatical . 
General [PER Alberto Muller  ] , a key proponent and planner of [LOC Venezuela  ] 's new military doctrine , announced February 14 that [LOC Iran  ] would be acting " in legitimate defense " if it were to use nuclear arms , although he cautioned that [LOC Venezuela  ] did not support the production of such weapons . 
According to [MISC Argentine  ] newspaper [ORG La Nacion  ] , [MISC Venezuelan  ] Ambassador to [LOC Argentina  ] [PER Roger Capella Mateo  ] stormed out of a Mercosur meeting with [MISC Spanish  ] Foreign Minister [PER Miguel Angel Moratinos  ] when [PER Moratinos  ] said his country opposed [LOC Iran  ] 's refusal to submit to nuclear controls. --------- Petroleum --------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Ideology may be the only explanation for bilateral cooperation in the petroleum sector . 
[LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] appear to enjoy each other 's company as fellow radical oil-producing countries . 
Both [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] are [ORG OPEC  ] price hawks , but their solidarity on the supply issue does not appear to have translated into many mutual benefits . 
Foreign Minister [PER Ali Rodriguez  ] told reporters March 11 that [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] were signing agreements because their oil policies coincided , but mentioned nothing tangible , digressing into how [LOC Venezuela  ] could benefit from [MISC Iranian  ] experience in the cooperative movement and in developing small agricultural machines . 
[LOC Venezuela  ] has granted the [MISC Iranian  ] company [ORG Petropars  ] the rights to certify a block in the [LOC Faja  ] region . 
The [MISC Iranians  ] , however , have no experience exploiting the extra heavy crude found in the area . 
( The industry perception is that if a company is granted rights to study a block in the [LOC Faja  ] , it will eventually be given a block in the area to exploit . 
) [ORG Chevron  ] representatives told us that the [MISC Iranians  ] approached them seeking assistance on carrying out the certification studies. -------------------------------------- Commercial [PER Agreements: Who  ] 's to Gain ? -------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) A USD 200 million binational fund to finance investment in both countries could ensure that commercial ties continue to grow . 
Nonetheless , the unprofitability of many of the deals inked with [LOC Iran  ] again raises the question of whether ideological factors are driving the relationship . 
For example , in January [LOC Venezuela  ] offered [LOC Iran  ] contracts to build low-income housing even though [LOC Iran  ] 's bid was twice as expensive as the [MISC Venezuelan  ] private sector 's . 
( Note: corruption could explain the overpricing , as well . 
) [LOC Venezuela  ] also plans to build a USD 220 million cement plant to supply the local market with [LOC Iran  ] 's help . 
Such a plant would appear to be a poor investment . 
Despite the enormous transportation costs for cement , multinational [ORG CEMEX  ] currently exports cement from [LOC Venezuela  ] for a price lower than the going [LOC Venezuela  ] rate because its local buyers delay payments , according to a prominent economic contact . 
[PER Chavez  ] announced in February he would import 10 [MISC Iranian  ] plants to process corn flour , a [MISC Venezuelan  ] staple . 
The [ORG BRV  ] likely sees the state takeover of this industry as a solution to recent shortages caused by its price controls . 
In another example of state economic planning and ideological ties trumping sound investment planning , [LOC Iran  ] will establish an ethanol plant in [LOC Lara State  ] , according to press reports . 
The [ORG BRV  ] may view the production of ethanol--a by-product of sugar refinery--as a fringe benefit to its project to resurrect failed [MISC Cuban  ] sugar mills in [LOC Venezuela.  ] ---------------------------------------- Going Nuclear ? : Uranium Rumors and More [LOC CARACAS  ] 00000958 003.2 OF 005 ---------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) As reported REF A , recent rumors that [LOC Venezuela  ] is trafficking in nuclear weapons and mining uranium for [LOC Iran  ] appear to be little more than the conspiracy-mongering by [PER Chavez  ] adversaries . 
More disconcerting , however , are [ORG BRV  ] and GOI statements that suggest a long-term plan to develop [LOC Venezuela  ] 's nuclear potential . 
[PER Chavez  ] mentioned on his weekly " [MISC Alo Presidente  ] " program in May 2005 the possibility of asking help from " countries like [LOC Iran  ] " in developing a nuclear energy program . 
In February 2006 , [LOC Iran  ] publicly affirmed its willingness to help [LOC Venezuela  ] develop nuclear energy , according to press reports . 
( See REF B for a description of [LOC Venezuela  ] 's need for foreign expertise to restart the fledgling nuclear program it shut down in the 1980s . 
) In March 2005 , a memorandum of understanding signed by the [MISC Iranian  ] and [MISC Venezuelan  ] Presidents established that [LOC Iran  ] would help [LOC Venezuela  ] create a " [ORG National Geoscience Database  ] " that would contain a survey of the mineral deposits throughout [MISC Venezuelan  ] territory . 
[PER Tomasso Tosini  ] , geologist and director of the [ORG Earth Sciences Institute  ] of the [ORG Central University of Venezuela  ] , told us in June 2005 that creating such a " basic geological map " of [LOC Venezuela  ] would be the logical first step to restarting a uranium program in [LOC Venezuela.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) During a February 2006 meeting with poloff , UCV professor and senior [ORG Accion Democratica  ] party official [PER Nelson Lara  ] claimed to have information substantiating [LOC Iran  ] 's involvement in [LOC Venezuela  ] 's mineral sector . 
[PER Lara  ] said active duty military officers in his classes told him that 20 [MISC Iranian  ] officials were working in the [ORG Ministry of Basic Industry  ] and [ORG Mines  ] . 
He said the [MISC Iranians  ] did not answer to any [MISC Venezuelan  ] management . 
[PER Lara  ] speculated about their involvement in uranium mining but said he did not know the [MISC Iranians'  ] role in the ministry . 
He added that 37 [MISC Iranians  ] were active in the [ORG Venezuelan Institute of Geology and Mines  ] , which [PER Chavez  ] launched in mid-2004. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [MISC Venezuelan  ] threats to take over property in areas believed to have significant radioactive deposits are fueling additional rumors that [LOC Venezuela  ] is planning to mine uranium . 
( Embassy note: Rumors that the [ORG BRV  ] is planning to mine these areas appear overblown . 
Factors besides uranium are driving the government 's targeting of land , although the delays in expropriations reported in REF C could also reflect [ORG BRV  ] attempts to drag out negotiations for land until it can gauge the true value of properties' mineral wealth . 
) In the mid-1980s , the [ORG Ministry of Energy and Mines  ] conducted preliminary geochemical samplings that indicated the possible presence of uranium deposits in at least two locations currently eyed by the government: -- The study revealed " anomalous areas to be assessed in more detail " along the [LOC Caroni River  ] in [LOC Bolivar State  ] , where the [ORG National Guard  ] has begun evicting individual gold and diamond prospectors reportedly to prevent them from damaging the environment . 
In mid-March , [ORG National Guard  ] attempts to dislodge people from the [LOC Caroni  ] basin ended in the deaths of two miners . 
Demanding the withdrawal of soldiers stationed in the [MISC Venezuelan  ] military 's fifth theater of operations ( [MISC TO5  ] ) , miners responded by blocking roads and burning [MISC TO5  ] facilities . 
-- The ministry report cited a section of [LOC Cojedes State  ] as a source of concentrated uranium . 
The area contains ranch and nature preserve [PER Hato Pinero  ] , which the government has targeted for possible expropriation . 
Concerned that the ranch 's alleged mineral wealth might attract [ORG BRV  ] interest , [LOC CARACAS  ] 00000958 004.2 OF 005 ranch owner [PER Jaime Perez Branger  ] gave us a copy of an earlier ( 1959 ) [ORG Ministry of Mines  ] report calling [PER Pinero  ] 's granite " the most radioactive in the region . 
" A footnote in the document , however , noted that the counters used in the 1959 study would not have detected uranium ore , one of many possible sources of radioactivity. ------- Defense ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) Defense cooperation may also help explain the expansion of the bilateral relationship ( REFS D and E ) . 
Indeed , an army official is scheduled to replace the current [MISC Iranian  ] Ambassador to [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
According to sensitive reporting , the [MISC Venezuelan  ] Government is seeking lethal armament from [LOC Iran  ] such as rockets and other explosive materiel . 
[LOC Venezuela  ] has also sought from [LOC Iran  ] parts for the [LOC U.S.  ] aircraft in its fleet that have been denied under the [ORG Department  ] 's policy prohibiting the sale of components for lethal munitions . 
Finally , sensitive reporting suggests that [LOC Venezuela  ] has sought help from [LOC Iran  ] in establishing its military reserve force . 
The [MISC Iranian  ] popular mobilization army ( [ORG Basij  ] ) and the revolutionary guard corps ( [ORG IRGC  ] ) invite comparison with [LOC Venezuela  ] 's still evolving parallel military structures: the reserves and the territorial guard . 
Commander of the [ORG Basij  ] Gen. [PER Mohammed Hejazi  ] visited [LOC Venezuela  ] in 2005 , and an [ORG IRGC  ] colonel has arrived here probably on permanent assignment . 
A retired military officer citing [MISC Venezuelan  ] reservists told us March 24 that [LOC Iran  ] had a small number of soldiers in [LOC Venezuela  ] training the reserves. --------------- Shared Culture ? --------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [LOC Venezuela  ] has a [MISC Muslim  ] population of about 250,000 including some tens of thousands of [LOC Shia'  ] . 
In addition to its political activities , the nine Iranians--including four career diplomats--posted to the [MISC Iranian  ] Embassy in [LOC Venezuela  ] represent a small but growing number of their citizens working in [LOC Venezuela  ] in both the formal and informal sectors . 
Cultural ties between the two countries , however , do little to help explain the expanding relationship . 
Most [MISC Venezuelans  ] are unfamiliar with [MISC Muslims  ] and are unable to distinguish [MISC Iranians  ] from [MISC Arabs  ] or from other [MISC Muslims  ] . 
Indeed , as REF F states about [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] , [MISC Venezuelan  ] and [MISC Iranian  ] societies have little more in common than their despotic leaders' antipathy toward the [LOC United States.  ] ------- Comment ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [LOC Venezuela  ] 's support for a country that has nuclear ambitions , supports terrorism , and talks about wiping [LOC Israel  ] off the map is of grave concern . 
It also alarms nations--such as [LOC France  ] ( REF G ) --that have tended to make light of our concerns about [LOC Venezuela  ] 's antidemocratic tendencies and militarization . 
We can exploit this alarm . 
Just as the shared animosity toward [LOC Washington  ] driving the [MISC Iran-Venezuela  ] relationship leads to irrational commercial endeavors , it is also likely to lead to additional diplomatic gaffes and other missteps that reflect poorly on the [ORG BRV  ] among wary international observers. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) We should not dismiss the uranium rumors . 
At the very least , it appears clear [LOC Venezuela  ] plans to prospect for [LOC CARACAS  ] 00000958 005.2 OF 005 uranium with the intention of starting a nuclear program . 
Like many [ORG BRV  ] schemes , the plan may remain in bureaucratic and financial limbo for years , and it may never be fulfilled . 
Yet , in the event that its ends are not peaceful , it warrants careful monitoring . 
All source information indicates [LOC Iran  ] needs foreign sources of uranium to maintain its nuclear program . 
How [LOC Iran  ] would benefit from any [MISC Venezuelan  ] plan to extract uranium will be an open question as long as [LOC Venezuela  ] 's uranium deposits remain unverified .
