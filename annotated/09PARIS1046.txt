Allegrone  ] , for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C/NF ) [ORG European Union  ] members will send low-ranking diplomats to the first of two inauguration ceremonies for [PER Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  ] , but they will not inform the [MISC Iranians  ] of their plans , according to [MISC French  ] MFA Acting [LOC Middle East Director  ] ( Assistant-Secretary equivalent ) [PER Jean-Christophe Paucelle  ] . 
If the [MISC Iranians  ] find out beforehand that the [ORG EU  ] will not send Ambassador-level representation , [PER Paucelle  ] told poloff early July 31 , then they may rescind the invitations to the August 3 event , as they did in similar circumstances prior to former President [PER Khatami 's  ] inauguration in 1997 . 
" It 's hard to keep a secret when 27 nations are involved , " [PER Paucelle  ] noted , " but we are trying . 
" Only the [MISC Swedish  ] [ORG EU  ] Presidency will be represented by an Ambassador , [PER Paucelle  ] said. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) All [ORG EU  ] members will , however , send their Ambassadors to the August 5 inauguration ceremony in the [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Parliament  ] . 
[PER Paucelle  ] adopted a defensive tone when explaining this decision , which he said was finalized in [LOC Brussels  ] the morning of July 31 . 
He admitted this issue had generated tense and fractious debate among [MISC European  ] foreign ministers . 
" We are caught between two conflicting objectives , " [PER Paucelle  ] explained . 
" On the one hand , we want to communicate that we do not approve of this illegitimate election . 
On the other hand , we need to be realistic: the power is in the hands of [MISC Khameini  ] and [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , including the nuclear file , and we must negotiate with those in power . 
You are in the same position . 
" [PER Paucelle  ] insisted that the [ORG EU  ] will continue to respect what he described as " the [LOC Durban  ] red lines . 
" " We will walk right out if [PER Ahmadinejad  ] denies the Holocaust or declares that his regime will destroy [LOC Israel  ] . 
" ( [PER NOTE: Paucelle  ] admitted that since non-Muslims had never before received an invitation to the inauguration ceremony presided over by the Supreme Leader , [ORG EU  ] diplomats in [LOC Tehran  ] have never entered the building where the event will take place , and so they are not sure how they will stage their walk-out , logistically , should they need to do so . 
They are worried that the doors may be locked . 
END NOTE . 
) [PER Paucelle  ] also reported that the [MISC German  ] Ambassador will return from his vacation on August 4 to ensure that he will miss the first ceremony and attend the second one along with his [ORG EU  ] counterparts . 
The [MISC British  ] Ambassador will attend as well , even without credentials . 
" The [MISC Iranians  ] are desperate for recognition and so they have disregarded their usual devotion to protocol -- and their anti-British vitriol -- on this occasion . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Paucelle  ] said that the case of detained [MISC French  ] citizen [PER Clothilde Reiss  ] has also influenced the [ORG EU  ] decision to attend the inauguration ceremonies . 
" We think she may be released soon , and we don't want to create another irritant , " [PER Paucelle  ] said . 
" There are enough already . 
" He reported that the [MISC French  ] have reason to believe [PER Reiss  ] may form part of a group of detainees likely to be released on the August 7 anniversary of [PER Imam Mahdi  ] . 
[PER Paucelle  ] noted that a letter released July 29 by [PER Ahmadinejad  ] supported the idea of granting clemency to post-election protesters during [PER Mahdi  ] celebrations . 
" The [MISC Iranians  ] will need to take face-saving measures , and so she will likely transfer to house arrest or some other status , " [PER Paucelle  ] said . 
He added that , of course , she may not be released at all next week , but the [MISC French  ] remain optimistic that she will soon be out of prison .
