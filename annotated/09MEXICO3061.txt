Reason: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary . 
DNI [PER Dennis Blair  ] met with President [PER Calderon  ] for about forty minutes at the [LOC Presidential Palace  ] on October 19 . 
The bulk of the discussion focused on cooperation on intelligence sharing and the integration of operations by [MISC Mexican  ] intelligence and law enforcement authorities . 
[PER Calderon  ] also commented extensively on political developments in [MISC Latin American  ] and the role of the [LOC United States  ] . 
While he said the [LOC United States  ] had regained significant stature in [LOC Latin America  ] , he also urged greater [LOC U.S.  ] involvement in the politics of the region . 
Several upcoming elections will be critical in shaping the region 's political course . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] , he said , needs to be seen as a critical player . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The issue at the heart of the discussion was that [LOC Mexico  ] must continue to improve its coordination and response capacity among its own security forces to act effectively on intelligence leads regardless of the source , including [LOC Mexico  ] 's own internal intelligence channels . 
[LOC Mexico  ] 's [ORG Federal Police  ] still largely bases its operational capacity in [LOC Mexico City  ] . 
The Secretary of Defense ( [ORG SEDENA  ] ) is more decentralized , but has yet to define a cooperative platform to work with the [ORG Federal Police  ] . 
When operations are undertaken in rural areas with difficult terrain , the complexity of moving large security operations in a short time frame may often result in targeted individuals escaping from these operations . 
[PER Calderon  ] said this situation made him " very sad , " and that it was a " great mistake " on their part . 
Further , [PER Calderon  ] indicated that he would assess the possibility of creating a joint strike force capability . 
( Note: In separate subsequent meetings , a discussion was launched with [ORG GOM  ] officials on the possibility of undertaking a simulated exercise that would begin to test how multiple agencies could cooperate together ( septel ) . 
End note . 
) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Blair  ] underscored that the fight against crime has to move beyond high-value targets . 
" Cut the head off this snake and new heads will grow . 
" [PER Blair  ] said the key ingredient to success is generating community confidence to call in tips against drug traffickers . 
To get that , people need to feel secure -- they have to believe that the police can maintain public safety . 
And it also means that intelligence has to be used quickly , effectively , and responsibly . 
Intelligence , operations , and institutional capacity have to be interwoven . 
[PER Calderon  ] agreed . 
He responded , " You made it very clear . 
Without attacking the body as well , we can't win . 
And we have to create the capacity to take on the body . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) DNI [PER Blair  ] asked [PER Calderon  ] for his perspective on political developments in the region and how the [LOC United States  ] could continue to increase its diplomatic effectiveness . 
[PER Calderon  ] emphasized that [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Hugo Chavez  ] is active everywhere , including [LOC Mexico  ] . 
He went out of his way to highlight that he believes [PER Chavez  ] funded the PRD opposition during the Presidential campaign nearly four years ago . 
[PER Chavez  ] uses social programs , including sending doctors , to curry political influence , and there are governors in [LOC Mexico  ] who may be friendly to him . 
[PER Calderon  ] said that [LOC Mexico  ] is trying to isolate [LOC Venezuela  ] through the [ORG Rio Group  ] . 
[PER Calderon  ] also commented that he is particularly concerned about [LOC Venezuela  ] 's relations with [LOC Iran  ] , and that the [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Mexico  ] is very active . 
[PER Calderon  ] underscored that [LOC Iran  ] 's growing influence in [MISC Latin American  ] should be of considerable concern to the [LOC United States  ] , and [PER Chavez  ] is doing all he can to aid and abet it. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Calderon  ] exhorted the [LOC U.S.  ] to watch [LOC Guatemala  ] and [LOC Belize  ] , since their internal weaknesses make them vulnerable . 
He is concerned about [LOC Mexico  ] 's southern border , and said the [ORG GOM  ] is starting a strategic planning process to better treat the topic . 
( Note: [PER Calderon  ] is scheduled to visit [LOC Guatemala  ] next week . 
End note . 
) [PER Calderon  ] later in the meeting raised the southern border again as an area for [MISC U.S.-Mexico  ] cooperation . 
Ambassador [PER Pascual  ] noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Mexico  ] were to hold the next day a joint conference on the [LOC Guatemala  ] border to combat arms trafficking from the south . 
[LOC MEXICO  ] 00003061 002 OF 002 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Circling back to [LOC Venezuela  ] , [PER Calderon  ] said that [PER Chavez  ] has no qualms about involving himself in [MISC Latin American  ] elections , and that he tried to do so in [LOC Mexico  ] 's own 2006 presidential contest . 
The region needs a visible [LOC U.S.  ] presence , he noted . 
[PER Chavez  ] , said [PER Calderon  ] , will also have the opportunity to do so in a number of upcoming votes , especially [LOC Honduras  ] . 
Most importantly , said [PER Calderon  ] , the [LOC United States  ] must be ready to engage the next [MISC Brazilian  ] president . 
[LOC Brazil  ] , he said , is key to restraining [PER Chavez  ] , but he lamented that President [PER Lula  ] has been reluctant to do so . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] needs to engage [LOC Brazil  ] more and influence its outlook . 
In closing , [PER Calderon  ] said that there is a link among [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Venezuela  ] , drugs , narcotics trafficking , and rule of law issues . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] should look at [LOC Latin America  ] from an interconnected perspective .
