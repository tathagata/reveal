( U ) This is an action request ; see para 5 . 
2 . 
( C ) The [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Libya  ] have an opportunity to strengthen the bilateral relationship by establishing a regular political-military dialogue , especially in light of their recent signing of a 505 agreement ( ref a ) . 
Furthermore , the [ORG Department concurs with Post  ] 's suggestion to establish an inaugural pol-mil dialogue in early 2010 ( ref b ) , and supports doing so as early as the January-February 2010 timeframe . 
These discussions should focus on building trust on issues such as regional security , defense capabilities and needs , end use monitoring , and broader security cooperation issues ( proposed agenda themes in para 5 ) . 
It should be made clear that [MISC Libyan  ] participation in this dialogue is not transactional in nature , but the goal is to establish a more effective channel for an effective security-related dialogue between the [ORG USG  ] and [ORG GOL  ] . 
3 . 
( C ) Given the sensitivity of the bilateral relationship at this time ( stemming in particular from the [MISC Libyan  ] welcome to [MISC Pan Am 103  ] bomber [MISC Abdelbaset  ] al-Megrahi , the human rights case of [PER Fathi al-Jahmi  ] , balking on WMD commitments ) and [ORG GOL  ] unfamiliarity with the mechanics and intent of pol-mil talks with the [ORG USG  ] , the [ORG Department proposes that Post  ] engage with the [ORG GOL  ] to establish a date for the inaugural pol-mil talks . 
4 . 
( C ) The [ORG Department envisions  ] that the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs lead the pol-mil talks with appropriate participation by [ORG NEA  ] , [ORG DOD/OSD  ] , [ORG DOD/Joint Staff  ] , [ORG AFRICOM  ] , the [ORG NSC  ] , and other interagency partners . 
The timing of inaugural talks will be the subject of close cooperation with [ORG Post  ] , [ORG NEA  ] , [ORG DOD  ] and the [ORG NSC  ] . 
These talks are separate from , and broader in scope than , the military to military " Council of Colonels " discussion ( to be held January 11-13 ) . 
5 . 
( C/REL [LOC LIBYA  ] ) Action Request: [ORG Post  ] is requested to draw upon the [MISC U.S.-proposed  ] agenda items below , and elicit [ORG GOL  ] proposals to develop the timing and substance of the pol-mil dialogue . 
[ORG Post  ] is also requested to begin discussions on the desired composition of delegations , timing , location , and other related matters . 
Regarding post 's input for agenda items in reftel B , the [ORG Department views  ] discussion of [LOC Libya  ] 's fulfillment of its [ORG Missile Technology Control Regime  ] ( [ORG MTCR  ] ) ( SCUD-B destruction ) commitments as better suited for established channels with officials from the [ORG Bureau of International Security  ] and [ORG Nonproliferation  ] . 
We also consider discussion of the disposition of [LOC Libya  ] 's efforts to take delivery of the [MISC C-130s  ] located in [LOC Marietta  ] , [LOC Georgia  ] as an " if raised " topic only for this forum , as the [ORG USG  ] has told the [ORG GOL  ] repeatedly to address any concerns about these aircraft directly with [ORG Lockheed Martin  ] .
