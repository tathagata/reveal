McMullen  ] for reason 1.4 ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY: Things are getting worse and worse in [LOC Eritrea  ] . 
The regime is facing mounting international pressure for years of malign behavior in the neighborhood . 
Human rights abuses are commonplace and most young [MISC Eritreans  ] , along with the professional class , dream of fleeing the country , even to squalid refugee camps in [LOC Ethiopia  ] or [LOC Sudan  ] . 
The economy continues to sink ; exports for 2008 totaled only $14m and vital hard-currency remittances have fallen to 43% of the 2005 level. “He is sick , ” said one leading [MISC Eritrean  ] businessman , referring to President [PER Isaias’  ] mental health. “The worse things get , the more he tries to take direct control--it doesn’t work.” The following three vignettes highlight the current state of affairs in [LOC Eritrea  ] . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) THE DEFENSE MINISTER AND THE COLONELS -------------------------------------------- Defense Minister [PER Sebhat Efrem  ] convoked army colonels in late November for a three-day conference on professional and career issues . 
On the second day a serious row reportedly broke out among the conferees ; the acrimony rose so high that General [PER Sebhat  ] cancelled the rest of the conference and sent the quarreling colonels back to their units . 
The bone of contention ? 
Perceived differences in the quality of the villas ( often confiscated from the original owners ) given to the colonels by the regime to maintain their allegiance. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) SOCCER TEAM 1 - REGIME 0 ---------------------------------- [MISC Eritreans  ] are mad about soccer . 
Many dusty streets in [LOC Asmara  ] are filled with urchins kicking an old sock stuffed with rags back and forth between goals made of piled stones . 
Senior government and party officials are avid fans of the [ORG British Premier League  ] and sometimes leave official functions early to catch key matches . 
Despite tight control of the domestic media , satellite TV dishes are allowed , probably so folks can watch international soccer . 
Impressive numbers of senior regime officials attended the [MISC World Cup  ] pool draw reception thrown by the [LOC South Africa  ] embassy last week . 
The [ORG BBC  ] and diaspora websites are reporting that the entire [MISC Eritrean  ] national soccer team defected after playing in a regional tournament in [LOC Kenya  ] . 
If true , this will be stunning news for the [MISC Eritrean  ] population . 
Only the coach and an escorting colonel reportedly returned to [LOC Eritrea  ] . 
( One wonders why , given their likely fate . 
) [PER Isaias  ] has previously claimed the [ORG CIA  ] was luring [MISC Eritrean  ] youth abroad ; if the soccer team has in fact defected , he will undoubted try to twist logic in some way to blame the [LOC United States.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ Content removed ] ---------------------------- [MISC Eritreans  ] are fearful of associating with foreigners , as they are often grilled afterwards by security thugs . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) COMMENT: The brittle [PER Isaias  ] regime is one pistol shot away from implosion . 
However , [PER Isaias  ] is clever , very good at operational security , and two decades younger than [PER Mugabe  ] . 
While many in [LOC Eritrea  ] long for change , few are in a position to effect it . 
END COMMENT .
