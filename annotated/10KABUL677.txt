( C ) A two-day provincial justice conference in [ORG Nangarhar  ] February 1-2 brought national justice representatives together with their [ORG Nangarhari  ] counterparts to discuss systemic justice challenges in the province . 
A small-group format resulted in frank discussions of provincial government corruption and dysfunction , with plenty of finger pointing between line ministries . 
Lack of communication between justice officials , lack of enforcement mechanisms for judicial and ministerial decisions , lack of infrastructure and resources , and fiercely territorial attitudes towards cases ( or prisoners ) that offer the opportunity for large bribes were identified as major challenges . 
Next steps include more frequent and effective judicial coordination meetings , creation of a [ORG Provincial Development Council  ] ( [ORG PDC  ] ) technical working group , anti-corruption training and application of enhanced pressure on all instruments of government to press for judicial reform . 
Although the conference highlighted serious problems with [ORG Nangarhar  ] , s justice system , the robust senior level attendance and intensity of the dialogue suggests that many provincial leaders want the justice system to function properly . 
End summary . 
[ORG GIROA Officials Present Provincial Perspective  ] --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) More than 200 provincial justice officials gathered at [ORG Nangarhar  ] Governor [PER Gul Agha Sherzai  ] , s conference hall on February 1-2 for a conference organized by [ORG PRT Nangarhar  ] and [ORG INL  ] , s [ORG Justice Sector Support Program  ] ( [ORG JSSP  ] ) . 
The two-day event brought together national representatives from the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] ( [ORG MOI  ] ) , [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] ( [ORG MOJ  ] ) , [ORG National Directorate of Security  ] ( [ORG NDS  ] ) , Attorney General , s office and the [ORG Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission  ] ( [ORG AIHRC  ] ) with their [ORG Nangarhari  ] counterparts to discuss systemic justice issues , and possible solutions . 
Prominent tribal and religious leaders , all 22 provincial sub-governors , [ORG NGOs  ] , and the deans of [ORG Nangarhar University  ] , s [ORG Sharia Law and Political Science  ] faculties attended . 
The first day involved brainstorming and breakout groups ( District Governors , Judges , [ORG MOJ  ] and Corrections , Police , Prosecutors , tribal leaders and human rights groups ) . 
Day two consisted of presentations by the national-level officials who chaired each group. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The small group format resulted in an unusually candid series of public exchanges among police , prosecutors and judges , each of whom openly accused the others of corruption and/or incompetence . 
At one point , the dialogue became so animated that some provincial officials felt the need to hijack the microphone ( and the agenda ) to defend their reputations . 
[ORG Nangarhar  ] , s Chief Prosecutor inadvertently highlighted the impotence of the provincial justice system by admitting that he had personally paid off squatters to leave his property , rather than deal with the laborious process of a lawsuit . 
The conference ended with a fiery speech from Governor [PER Sherzai  ] condemning the inability of provincial prosecutors and judges to convict criminals , and a frank discussion of corruption by [PER Shinwari  ] tribal elder [PER Malik Usman  ] , who laughingly admitted to having bribed district governors and many other provincial justice officials in attendance . 
MOJ: A Failure to Communicate ? --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Lack of justice sector coordination was the most common complaint raised at the conference . 
The [ORG MOJ  ] ( which runs the prison system ) repeatedly cited arbitrary detention policies , claiming that some prisoners are incarcerated without trial for much longer than the nine-month legal limit . 
Others are kept in jail despite acquittal at trial or serving their full sentences - either because prosecutors or judges fail to inform corrections officials of the disposition of their cases , or because a monetary judgment against the inmates could not be paid. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Though the [MISC Huqoq  ] department has lead responsibility for property disputes , some participants noted that claimants often go directly to district governors or the [ORG Ministry of Agriculture  ] , s property department for resolution . 
In cases where land disputes lead to violence , the [ORG MOJ  ] complained that prosecutors often take over both the criminal case and the underlying civil dispute . 
The [ORG MOJ  ] lamented that in the rare cases they are permitted to resolve , they are powerless to [LOC KABUL  ] 00000677 002 OF 003 enforce the decisions . 
The [ORG MOJ  ] proposed criminalizing land-grabbing so that police would enforce compliance . 
The [ORG MOJ  ] also expressed frustration with the [ORG Afghan Supreme Court  ] , s habit of reconsidering and revising its rulings in property cases , leaving the [ORG MOJ  ] ( which is tasked with enforcing the [ORG Supreme Court  ] , s property decisions ) to re-apportion land previously allocated or sold in conformance with the original holding. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG MOJ  ] Deputy Minister [PER Hashemzai  ] noted the constitutional guarantee of counsel for indigent defendants cannot be met without more resources . 
Participants agreed that international donor funding could resolve this issue , though of course this raises questions of sustainability . 
[PER Hashemzai  ] also delivered broad criticism of police , for detaining prisoners in excess of 72 hours for the purpose of extracting money from their families , and of prosecutors , for taking bribes to dismiss cases , and for failing to move cases through the system within the required month . 
The Deputy Minister also criticized judges for inappropriately hearing appeals of cases that received final judgments in trial courts in accordance with the law . 
Attorney General: Nothing Can Come of [MISC No Evidence  ] --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Prosecutors noted that police rarely comply with legal requirements to notify the Attorney General , s ( AG , s ) office within 24 hours of detaining a suspect , and often keep detainees well beyond the 72 hour statutory limit in order to extract bribes . 
Prosecutors defensively claimed that their own detainee releases are a result of insufficient evidence received from police , and not because they have taken bribes . 
They gave the specific example of an individual , [PER Zabibullah  ] from [LOC Chaparahar  ] district , who was detained by police for possession of a special phone rigged to detonate IEDs , but whose evidence packet lacked an actual phone . 
Prosecutors also complained that police often failed to comply with the requirement to bring along a prosecutor on all search warrant executions . 
Prosecutors said that in cases where suspects are released on a guarantee ( the [MISC Afghan  ] equivalent of bail , using honor as collateral instead of cash ) , police are unwilling to track down guarantors when a defendant fails to appear for a hearing. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) In an unscheduled speech , [ORG Nangarhar  ] Chief Prosecutor [PER Abdullah Qayum  ] denied any coordination issues , claiming that his office had no problems with the police . 
[PER Qayum  ] , s speech , while rambling and at times incoherent , appeared to be an attempt to distance himself from the criticism articulated by his prosecutors of other ministries . 
He ended by discussing the importance of resolving property disputes in [LOC Nangarhar  ] , inadvertently highlighting the impotence of [LOC Nangarhar  ] , s legal system by admitting that he had personally paid off squatters to leave his property rather than deal with the laborious process of a lawsuit . 
Judges Also Frustrated ---------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The judges were by far the most organized and productive group at the conference . 
[PER Justice Norzai  ] , who chaired the group , discussed widespread dissatisfaction with the quality of evidence presented at trial , noting that even basic evidence such as crime scene photographs or physical evidence ( i.e. , guns or drugs ) were rarely provided at trial . 
Rather than request financial assistance for the judiciary , the judges requested assistance in developing provincial forensic capabilities , including equipment , facilities and training for provincial crime scene investigators . 
The current system requires evidence to be sent to [LOC Kabul  ] for forensic analysis , which results in frequent chain-of-custody problems , numerous errors and huge delays in the trial process. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The judges also voiced frustration with their inability to effect compliance with their decisions or compel court appearances . 
If a witness does not appear in court without justification , the Court is permitted to order the police to accompany them to trial , and impose a 500 [MISC Afghani  ] fine . 
However , the judges explained that police seem unwilling or unable to serve process on witnesses or defendants , especially in tribal areas , and suggested developing a program permitting local tribal leaders to function as legal process servers ( one who delivers or serves legal documents to a defendant or individual involved in a court case ) . 
Other issues raised by the judges included a need for increased security for high-profile judges dealing [LOC KABUL  ] 00000677 003 OF 003 with sensitive cases and the widespread dearth of defense counsel . 
Comment: Next Steps ------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The conference succeeded in identifying key issues impeding the rule of law in [LOC Nangarhar  ] province . 
[PER USG Rule  ] of [ORG Law Advisors  ] plan to work with [MISC Afghan  ] counterparts and the [ORG United Nations Assistance Mission  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] to hold more frequent and more effective judicial coordination meetings . 
We will also work with [MISC Afghan  ] officials to create a [ORG Provincial Development Council  ] ( [ORG PDC  ] ) technical working group on governance , rule of law and human rights , provide anti-corruption training and apply pressure on all instruments of government to reform . 
Although the conference highlighted serious problems with [LOC Nangarhar  ] , s justice system , the robust senior level attendance and intensity of the dialogue suggests that many provincial leaders want the justice system to function properly .
