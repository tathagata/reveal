REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [ORG Summary:  ] The latest round of [MISC EU-Libya Framework Agreement  ] negotiations hit snags over sensitive political issues and were slowed by [LOC Libya  ] 's inefficient technical bureaucracy . 
The [MISC Libyans  ] denounced the [ORG International Criminal Court  ] and decreed that any language similar to the [LOC Rome  ] Statute was off limits . 
Trade talks stalled when the [MISC Libyans  ] announced that they had not examined the draft paper ( presented in early 2009 ) and were unable to produce trade statistics from 2007/2008 or provide data on the [MISC Libyan  ] tariff system . 
Talks on migration went more smoothly than expected , but significant issues remain before the agreement could be given to member states for approval . 
[ORG EU  ] diplomats in [LOC Tripoli  ] are skeptical that the [ORG EC  ] will be able to get an agreement that can be implemented by both sides within the remaining two rounds of talks . 
Learning from [LOC Libya  ] 's negotiating tactics with the [ORG EC  ] will be key to ensuring [MISC US-Libya  ] agreements are both signed and implemented . 
End Summary . 
POLITICAL DIALOGUE: THE [ORG EC  ] DANCES ON LIBYA'S " RED LINE " 2 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) Representatives of the [ORG European Commission  ] ( [ORG EC  ] ) based in [LOC Brussels  ] conducted the latest round of [MISC Framework Agreement  ] negotiations July 13-14 in [LOC Tripoli  ] with sessions focused on political dialogue , trade and commerce , and migration . 
Diplomats from [ORG EU  ] member states -- participating as observers to the [MISC EC-Libya  ] negotiations -- said that discussions on the political framework were particularly heated . 
[MISC Libyan  ] negotiator [PER Mohammed Siala  ] railed against language stating that the two parties agreed to discuss crimes against humanity in an international context , angrily stating that any mention of the [ORG International Criminal Court  ] ( [ORG ICC  ] ) or text similar to that of the [LOC Rome  ] Statute would cause a total breakdown of the framework negotiations . 
According to the [LOC UK  ] embassy , nothing in the political dialogue paper is binding on either party and is merely agenda-setting for future discussions . 
[ORG EC  ] negotiators were not/not pushing for [LOC Libya  ] to accede to the [LOC ICC.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>Â¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In contrast to the [ORG ICC  ] discussions , the [MISC Libyan  ] delegation readily agreed to the [ORG EC  ] 's proposed language regarding civil society , leading one [ORG EC  ] negotiator to speculate that the [MISC Libyan  ] delegation did not fully understand the text . 
However , the same negotiator also noted that the [ORG EC  ] civil society text did not include any mention of non-governmental organizations . 
TRADE AND MIGRATION: HITS AND MISSES 4 . 
( C ) A planned session on trade and commerce was largely postponed after [MISC Libyan  ] lead negotiator [PER Abdulati al-Obeidi  ] informed the [ORG EC  ] that [LOC Libya  ] had not fully examined the draft paper presented to them in early 2009 . 
[PER Obeidi  ] said information requested by [ORG EC  ] negotiators on trade statistics for 2007 and 2008 were unavailable and that [LOC Libya  ] was unable to provide technical details of its tariff schedule as it was " in flux " due to a restructuring movement . 
Technical-level discussions on trade and commerce are slated for September in [LOC Brussels  ] -- one month ahead of the next negotiating round . 
[MISC Italian  ] and [MISC British  ] diplomats reported that the main policy disagreement on trade and commerce was over [MISC Mediterranean  ] fisheries , with [MISC Libyan  ] negotiators stating strong opposition to the Law of the [LOC Sea  ] . 
On migration , the chief [ORG EC  ] negotiator told [ORG EU  ] diplomats that the negotiations were a " step forward " and that more progress was made than expected with no major objections from either side on the draft as presented . 
5 . 
( C ) The sides have two more regular rounds of negotiation in October and December . 
[MISC Libyan  ] officials had previously seemed keen on signing the agreement in advance of the 40th anniversary of the coup that brought [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] to power on September 1 . 
With that milestone out of reach and with several member states holding out the possibility of vetoing the agreement based on bilateral calculus , some local diplomats expect the negotiations to run several more rounds . 
COMMENT 6 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) : It is worth studying the outcomes of negotiations between the technically minded [ORG EC  ] negotiators and their symbolically driven [MISC Libyan  ] counterparts as we examine our own , more limited agreements . 
Smaller [ORG EU  ] countries seem eager to take a hard-line on political and technical approach that could drive the [MISC Libyans  ] away from the table . 
Diplomats from the [LOC UK  ] , [LOC France  ] , [LOC Italy  ] , and [LOC Germany  ] see two possible end states: the [MISC Libyans  ] will either rush to sign an agreement that they don't intend to implement in order to " close the file " with [LOC Europe  ] or will extend indefinitely negotiations on what is essentially a non-binding agenda for future engagement . 
According to diplomats here , the [ORG EC  ] team seems more concerned about the [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000579 002.2 OF 002 latter . 
This tack may encourage [LOC Libya  ] to succumb to the former in a continuation of previous failures to fully implement agreements . 
As we pursue our own agreements such as a [LOC TIFA  ] with [LOC Libya  ] , maintaining negotiating flexibility and strategic patience will be key to ensuring a signed -- and implement-able -- document .
