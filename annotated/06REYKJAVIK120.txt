( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Summary: The Government  ] and news media of [LOC Iceland  ] , for the most part , have echoed FM [ORG Haarde  ] 's cautious optimism over the round of bilateral defense talks in [LOC Reykjavik  ] 3/31 . 
The two leading newspapers published editorials praising the talks for providing the first step toward clarifying the defense issue and for demonstrating the seriousness with which the [LOC United States  ] views the issue . 
The [ORG USG  ] has promised a detailed [MISC EUCOM  ] defense plan for [LOC Iceland  ] in April - [PER Haarde  ] 's degree of satisfaction with the plan should largely define media reaction . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Deputy Assistant Secretary of State [PER Mark Pekala  ] was widely quoted by the news media , telling the press after the talks that the [ORG U.S. Government  ] is working on plans for the defense of [LOC Iceland  ] and will evaluate defense requirements-the need for personnel and materiel-after the fighters had gone . 
He said the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation had listened to the comments , questions , and ideas advanced by the [MISC Icelandic  ] delegation . 
He added that more meetings would take place in the near future in [LOC Reykjavik  ] , [LOC Washington  ] and perhaps elsewhere . 
Mr. [PER Pekala  ] said he thought this work would lead to stronger defense for this country and for the [LOC United States.  ] -------------------- Ministerial Reaction -------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Foreign Minister [PER Geir Haarde  ] told reporters after the March 31 defense talks ( see Ref B ) that the [ORG Icelandic Government  ] did not have many options regarding defense . 
He said , " We will continue discussing the matter with friendly nations in NATO. but I do not consider it realistic to assume that other countries could take on the role that the [LOC United States  ] has played here . 
" " The next step , " the Foreign Minister said , " is for [ the [MISC Americans  ] ] to continue preparing plans for [LOC Iceland  ] 's defense , and then present them to us in a few weeks' time . 
" He said he hopes [LOC Iceland  ] 's views are accommodated , and added that [LOC Iceland  ] hopes the [LOC United States  ] will clarify what it plans to do with certain facilities , such as the [LOC IADS  ] radar stations. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) When asked whether he was more at peace now than when he received the March 15 phone call from [PER U/S Burns  ] , informing him of the decision to close the base , [PER Haarde  ] said: " Yes , I could say I am , as far as it goes . 
I think things are moving in the right direction , compared to what has gone before . 
We naturally hope that there will not be a defense vacuum here , and that whatever replaces the fighters will be sufficient . 
We want a credible defense , or plans for credible defense , which would ensure that no one would ever think of making a surprise attack on this country . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Prime Minister [PER Halldor Asgrimsson  ] told reporters at a meeting of the [ORG Progressive Party  ] March 31 that [LOC U.S.  ] behavior in recent weeks has been disappointing . 
He said the defense talks have been launched but that nothing new had been proposed . 
He said that once the [LOC U.S.  ] presents its plan for the defense of [LOC Iceland  ] , in about one month , if [LOC Iceland  ] believes the plan is unsatisfactory , then it would consult with other [ORG NATO  ] countries to explore other options. ------- Opinion ------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The generally upbeat mood of the Foreign Minister was reflected in editorials published by the two leading [MISC Icelandic  ] newspapers over the weekend . 
[ORG Frettabladid  ] ( the largest circulation daily with a print run of 75,000 ) , said a new chapter in relations has begun . 
Its editorial said: " This meeting had been anticipated with much excitement . 
No result came out of the meeting since everyone expected small steps to be taken at the beginning of the talks . 
After the meeting one could sense that the focus was clearer than before . 
Even if political leaders have different reactions to the meeting , the focus is clearer . 
" Morgunbladid , the newspaper of record ( 52,000 ) that is close to [ORG Haarde  ] 's [ORG Independence Party  ] , said in its editorial: " Even though we may have strongly disapproved of the way in which the [LOC United States  ] went to work on the matter a few weeks ago , there is reason to welcome the seriousness with which that country is approaching this new task . 
The best option for [LOC Iceland  ] , in the present state of affairs , is ongoing cooperation with the [LOC United States  ] on defense . 
So , after the first negotiating session , there is cause to pin some hopes on these talks . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: Over the weekend , reporters and leader writers showed an inclination away from [PER Asgrimsson  ] 's negativity towards [PER Haarde  ] 's cautiously optimistic message - let 's see what the [MISC Americans  ] will offer before we decide they're leaving us in the lurch . 
The [ORG USG  ] has promised a detailed [MISC EUCOM  ] defense plan for [LOC Iceland  ] in April . 
Given what we 've seen of his influence this weekend , [PER Haarde  ] 's degree of satisfaction with that plan should largely define media reaction . 
End comment .
