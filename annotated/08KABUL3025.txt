( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC SUMMARY: Although  ] the violence in [LOC Kunduz Province  ] has not reached levels found elsewhere in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , security incidents are on the rise . 
Increasingly organized and deadly insurgent attacks throughout the summer and autumn have frayed the nerves of officials in [LOC Kunduz Province  ] . 
Regular rocket , improvised explosive device ( [ORG IED  ] ) and suicide attacks against the [ORG PRT  ] , combined with sophisticated assaults against [ORG ANP  ] positions , have increasingly frustrated [LOC Kunduz  ] Governor [PER Mohammad Omar  ] , who feels the needs of the [ORG Northeast  ] are neglected . 
Under increasing pressure , [PER Omar  ] has traveled to [LOC Kabul  ] to lobby for more resources . 
He used the occasion also to meet with the Ambassador to underscore his concerns. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) A number of high-profile attacks against coalition forces throughout the summer and autumn underscore what has been a troubling year for [LOC PRT Kunduz  ] . 
Earlier in the year , [LOC Berlin  ] dispatched a 200-strong airborne infantry company to shore up near-perimeter security after a series of rocket attacks on the [ORG PRT  ] in the latter half of 2007 ( REFTEL ) . 
While this temporarily neutralized the immediate threat , their numbers were reduced in June to 120 and rocket attacks resumed in August . 
That same month , an [ORG IED  ] killed one [MISC German  ] soldier and wounded three . 
In October , a suicide bomber killed two [MISC German  ] soldiers on patrol . 
Five [MISC Afghan  ] children were also killed in the attack . 
So far this year , five suicide bombers in [LOC Kunduz Province  ] have attacked [MISC German  ] forces . 
All three [MISC German  ] military deaths in [LOC Afghanistan  ] this year occurred in [LOC Kunduz  ] 's [LOC Chahar  ] [MISC Dara District.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Afghan  ] security forces have been plagued with a series of personnel changes , resource limitations and disruptions which have strained efforts to effectively combat increasingly sophisticated insurgent activity in [LOC Kunduz  ] . 
In July , Chief of Police [PER Mohammad Ayoub  ] Salangi transferred to [LOC Kabul  ] and was replaced in August by General [PER Rizzaq Ayuby  ] . 
While General [PER Rizzaq  ] , who served as temporary Police Chief of [LOC Kabul  ] from April to August , has made an impression as an innovator , he has yet to firmly establish himself . 
Also this summer , the [ORG ANP  ] was compelled to dissolve its 100-man protective detail , used to guard [ORG NGO  ] and international facilities , in order to shore up the dwindling number of regular [ORG ANP  ] soldiers caused by this summer 's Tashqil enforcement . 
Further straining [ORG ANP  ] resources is the regular seconding of [ORG ANP  ] troops to troubled provinces further south. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In September , the [MISC Afghan  ] Army replaced the 2nd [PER Kandak  ] ( battalion ) . 
Newly arrived in the province , the 3rd [PER Kandak  ] was quickly dispatched to [LOC Badakhshan  ] and [PER Takhar Provinces  ] in support of the [MISC Voter Registration  ] process . 
The 360 man [PER Kandak  ] is widely seen as stretched too thin , as its area of responsibility includes [LOC Baghlan  ] , [LOC Badakhshan  ] , [LOC Kunduz  ] and [PER Takhar Provinces  ] . 
The arrival of the new [PER Kandak  ] has also created structural difficulties in its relationship with the [ORG PRT  ] . 
Whereas the previous [PER Kandak  ] 's [MISC German  ] Operational [ORG Mentor  ] and [ORG Liaison Team  ] ( [ORG OMLT  ] ) was well integrated with the [ORG PRT  ] command structure , the [MISC Croatian  ] [ORG OMLT  ] has found communication more difficult , at times straining coordination efforts. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In recent weeks , the [ORG ANP  ] has found itself on the defensive as attacks have become increasingly sophisticated . 
A frontal assault on the [LOC Chahar  ] [MISC Dara District Headquarters  ] , while without casualties , was notable in its utilization of a classic three-point attack strategy . 
The newly appointed Police Chief of [LOC Chahar  ] [MISC Dara District  ] was attacked by an [ORG IED  ] , had to seek medical treatment in [LOC India  ] and has just recently returned . 
In addition , the technical level of attacks has increased , with the recent introduction of jammer-proof IEDs to the province . 
Provincial officials have responded to the increased disruption in [LOC Chahar  ] [MISC Dara  ] by dispatching 50 extra [ORG ANP  ] , NDS and [ORG ANA  ] personnel to the district to supplement existing [ORG ANSF  ] forces. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The picture , however , is not entirely bleak . 
While the [ORG ANA  ] and [ORG ANP  ] personnel changes were disruptive , the new [ORG ANA  ] Commander and [ORG ANP  ] Chief have made a positive impression . 
The [ORG ANP  ] 's General [PER Rizzaq  ] , for example , has worked closely with the [ORG U.S. Army CSTC-A Police Mentoring Team  ] to train a [ORG Quick Reaction Force  ] of up to 50 officers who will be able to conduct operations throughout the district . 
[LOC Baghlan Province  ] is now also considering a similar , though shorter , training program . 
[LOC Chahar  ] [MISC Dara  ] and [LOC Imam Sahib Districts  ] are now also completing their [ORG Focused District Development KABUL  ] 00003025 002 OF 002 training cycle , with [ORG Khanabad District  ] the next to be trained . 
This program has brought about a noticeable increase in morale and effectiveness . 
Most importantly , there are signs the general public does not want to move down the road to insurgency , despite ongoing insurgent intimidation campaigns . 
A recent suicide plot directed against [ORG ISAF  ] forces unraveled when villagers in [ORG Khanabad District  ] overpowered the handler , who is now in NDS custody . 
The suicide attacker himself exploded on his motorbike far from his potential victims ( [ORG SEPTEL  ] ) . <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Local officials remain frustrated by the lack of resources and the belief the [ORG Taliban  ] are now targeting [LOC Kunduz Province  ] for destabilization on a priority basis . 
Governor [PER Omar  ] has expressed disappointment with [MISC German  ] tactics , as [ORG IED  ] and suicide incidents increase and joint security activities yield few results . 
He believes the [MISC German  ] forces are too conservative in their methods and when the [ORG PRT  ] acts , it is only with large numbers after days of preparation , allowing insurgent forces plenty of time to vacate an area . 
[PER Omar  ] has repeatedly expressed the need to set up a multi-lateral quick reaction force to quickly act upon intelligence . 
NDS Chief Majid , for his part , lays blame with the judicial system and has ready anecdotes of arrested insurgents being subsequently released due to corrupt and frightened officials . 
Governor [PER Omar  ] recently traveled to [LOC Kabul  ] to lobby for additional reserve policemen , funding to reinstate the [ORG ANP  ] protection unit and an [ORG ANA  ] Kandak devoted to [LOC Kunduz Province  ] alone. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While in [LOC Kabul  ] , Governor [PER Omar  ] also met on November 16 with the Ambassador to reiterate his concerns . 
He said the [ORG Taliban  ] has decided to target his province because it previously was one of its military and political bases , many [MISC TB  ] supporters had escaped following the [ORG Taliban  ] 's fall and those people continued to provide backing . 
He also cited poverty as a factor influencing some popular attitudes . 
[PER Omar  ] indicated that while in [LOC Kabul  ] he was approaching both [ORG MOI  ] and NDS to request help . 
The Ambassador said he would speak to Minister of Interior Atmar regarding the law enforcement presence in [LOC Kunduz  ] but would of course support the Minister 's decisions. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
COMMENT: Although one of the longest serving governors in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Omar  ] faces these worsening security challenges at a time when he is widely perceived as weak and increasingly disconnected . 
[PER Omar  ] 's frustration ultimately lies in his inability to respond effectively to escalating security concerns with his limited resources . 
Lack of [ORG ANSF  ] manpower , the drying up of actionable intelligence due to insurgent intimidation , the continued power wielded by local strongmen and a weak government infrastructure all contribute to his security problems . 
This year 's opening of [LOC Kunduz  ] 's [ORG Joint Provincial Coordination Center  ] , [ORG CSTC-A  ] and [ORG EUPOL  ] mentoring of [ORG ANP  ] forces and continuing joint-action exercises and operations with the [MISC German  ] [ORG PRT  ] have all worked to raise the level of [ORG ANSF  ] operational effectiveness . 
Without the resources to build on these successes , however , [PER Omar  ] will continue to feel hemmed in and his position remains unstable .
