PLEASE HANDLE ACCORDINGLY . 
1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY: Overtoomseveld is a [MISC Moroccan  ] neighborhood in [LOC Western Amsterdam  ] , made notorious on November 2 , 2004 when native son [PER Mohammed Bouyeri  ] murdered filmmaker [PER Theo van Gogh  ] on an [LOC Amsterdam  ] street in broad daylight . 
One year later , it remains a largely segregated community , in many ways more [MISC Arab  ] than [MISC Dutch  ] . 
Over the last year , Embassy and Consulate officials visited this economically depressed neighborhood several times and established contacts with local [MISC Muslim  ] and non-Muslim residents , at least one of whom knew [PER Bouyeri  ] prior to the murder . 
Despite local police and community outreach programs , [MISC Dutch  ] authorities worry that [MISC Muslim  ] minority youth in segregated neighborhoods like Overtoomseveld remain prime targets for recruitment by [MISC Islamic  ] extremist groups because of their alienation from broader [MISC Dutch  ] society and limited economic opportunities . 
END SUMMARY . 
WELCOME TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD --------------------------- 2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Overtoomseveld  ] in [LOC West Amsterdam  ] is a neighborhood of approximately 8,000 residents . 
It lies just outside [LOC Amsterdam  ] 's ring motorway , but only a ten-minute bike-ride from the down-town area . 
In contrast to the 18th and 19th century buildings on the other side of the ring , housing in [LOC Overtoomseveld  ] consists primarily of concrete , prefabricated apartment blocs built during the 1960 's and 70 's to provide housing for low-income [MISC Dutch  ] families . 
3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Until the 1980s the neighborhood was almost exclusively white , working-class [MISC Dutch  ] . 
According to local contacts , however , about 80 percent of the residents of [LOC Overtoomseveld  ] today are non-indigenous [MISC Dutch  ] ( allochtonen ) of [MISC Moroccan  ] or other [MISC Arab  ] descent . 
As [MISC Moroccan  ] immigrants gradually moved in , many white families with the economic means to do so moved to single-family houses in other parts of the city or in the more distant suburbs . 
4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Muslim  ] character of [LOC Overtoomseveld  ] is immediately apparent to the casual visitor . 
Women are more visible on balconies ( usually with small children ) than on the street , and nearly all wear headscarves . 
[MISC Arabic  ] language shop-window signs and graffiti -- much of it anti- [MISC American  ] -- are common . 
THE DISH AND THE MINARET ------------------------ 5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Although fairly tidy by [LOC U.S.  ] standards , [LOC Overtoomseveld  ] is considered run-down by the immaculate [MISC Dutch  ] . 
There is more litter and graffiti than in other parts of the city , and properties , usually owned by absentee landlords , show signs of neglect such as broken windows and stoops . 
Within [LOC Amsterdam  ] 's [MISC Moroccan  ] community , it is common for large extended families to share small rental apartments , creating additional strains on the poorly constructed structures . 
The government subsidizes most of the council housing in the neighborhood , and is a significant source of income through the provision of unemployment , rent support and social welfare benefits . 
6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The large number of satellite dishes , used to beam in [MISC Arabic  ] stations such as al [PER Jazeera  ] , have earned Overtoomseveld the derogatory sobriquet of a dish city in [MISC Dutch  ] . 
Satellite television is cheaper than [MISC Dutch  ] cable and provides a direct link to the home cultures of many immigrants , but many non-immigrant [MISC Dutch  ] criticize the prevalence of satellite broadcasting as insulating immigrant communities from mainstream [MISC Dutch  ] culture and encouraging segregation . 
7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The neighborhood 's one [MISC Moroccan  ] mosque plays a critical role in satisfying residents' spiritual and cultural needs . 
When Emboff visited the mosque during the middle of the afternoon , there were about 20 middle-aged men inside . 
One [MISC English  ] speaker graciously offered a tour around the mosque . 
The mosque has a food store and classrooms for the 100 children aged 6-12 attending [MISC Arabic  ] and [MISC Koran  ] classes on weekends . 
Like elsewhere in the [LOC Netherlands  ] , the imam speaks little [MISC Dutch  ] and was imported from [LOC Morocco  ] . 
On Fridays , the mosque has an overflow capacity and worshippers spill into the streets for prayers . 
The imam has a cordial relationship with local police -- there is a police station next door -- and has cooperated with police requests to disperse worshippers quickly after prayers to avoid congestion . 
THE PROBLEM OF YOUTH -------------------- 8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) During non-school hours , groups of young men and boys hang out on the neighborhood 's streets and stoops with little to do . 
As a result , incidents of petty crime and vandalism are high . 
During a recent visit by Emboffs , several groups of young boys were gathered outside two neighborhood internet cafes . 
According to local contacts , one of these cafes -- across from a police station -- had earlier been used by members of the extremist [MISC Hofstad  ] group , including [PER Bouyeri  ] . 
Local police regularly drop in on these cafes and report seeing [MISC Arabic  ] websites being accessed ; few have the language skills , however , to determine what sort of information is being shared . 
9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Neighborhood youth are also active graffiti artists ; when the Consul General and emboffs toured the neighborhood in late September , graffiti on apartment buildings included obscenities against President [PER Bush  ] , adoration for [PER Saddam Hussein  ] and several HAMAS-related displays . 
According to police contacts , local police are now trained to monitor amounts and types of graffiti as signs of radicalism . 
10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In 1998 , riots between [MISC Moroccan  ] youth and [MISC Dutch  ] police in several cities soured already bad relations between the two groups . 
In response , a number of community initiatives were launched , such as the establishment of police Youth Coordinators in various neighborhoods to enhance dialogue between the police and [MISC Moroccan  ] youth . 
While the focus of these efforts originally was to reduce petty crime , it has now shifted to combating radicalization . 
The neighborhood watch group , Neighborhood Fathers , is another organization established to reduce crime that has now taken on a counter-extremism focus . 
REACHING OUT TO RADICALS ------------------------ 11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) According to [LOC Amsterdam  ] [MISC West Youth  ] Coordinator [PER Tom Smakman  ] , Overtoomseveld is not the toughest neighborhood in [LOC Amsterdam  ] , but it is the most likely to produce radicals . 
[PER Smakman  ] claimed this was because of the density of the population and the level of poverty among its residents: People know that there are a lot of frustrated youths in this neighborhood . 
He stressed that police are less worried about what takes place on the streets -- which they can monitor -- than about what goes on behind closed doors . 
According to [PER Smakman  ] , radical views are more widespread than ever among local youth , many of whom consider [PER Bouyeri  ] a hero . 
Many youth , however , will not express their feelings openly in public or in the presence of their parents , who largely reject such views . 
However , [PER Smakeman  ] added , We don't know what happens when the drapes are shut . 
12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Smakman  ] speaks from experience , having come into contact with [PER Mohammed Bouyeri  ] and other [MISC Hofstad  ] group members through his efforts to reach out to community groups . 
[PER Bouyeri  ] , for example , was temporarily on the editorial staff of a [MISC Dutch/Turkish/Arabic  ] neighborhood newspaper co-sponsored by local police and a neighborhood organization to promote employment among local youth . 
According to [PER Smakman  ] , [PER Bouyeri  ] was known for his columns encouraging youth to empower themselves to achieve success in [MISC Dutch  ] society . 
[PER Smakman  ] noted that [PER Bouyeri  ] 's transformation from integration proponent to extremist murderer was surprisingly sudden , but there were signs -- such as when [PER Bouyeri  ] refused to shake the hand of his longtime friend one day without explanation . 
13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Another [MISC Hofstad  ] suspect now awaiting trial , [PER Yusef Etoumi  ] , participated in 2000 in a three-week summer program for high-risk [MISC Dutch-Moroccan  ] youth to perform service projects in [LOC Morocco  ] . 
The program , entitled And Now Something Positive , was another initiative launched to improve inter-community relations following the 1998 riots and is sponsored by several [MISC Dutch  ] companies . 
[PER Smakman  ] , who took part in the trip as a chaperone , remembered [PER Etoumi  ] as a quiet kid , not a criminal boy who engaged in soft drug use . 
COMMENT ------- 14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Overtoomseveld lived up to its radical reputation two weeks ago when additional arrests of several alleged [ORG Hofstad Group  ] members were made there . 
Despite many community programs and active involvement by the police and residents over the last few years , young people , especially young men , in this neighborhood continue to feel excluded from society and trapped in segregated communities that provide no solid social identity . 
[MISC Dutch  ] authorities worry that such youth are vulnerable to the allure of an [MISC Islamic  ] extremist message that promises to give them a sense of belonging and empowerment . 
One year after the murder of van [MISC Gogh  ] , however , the [MISC Dutch  ] government still has no good plan for preventing the emergence of new [PER Mohammed Bouyeris  ] from the same mean streets . 
END COMMENT .
