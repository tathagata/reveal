( S ) Summary . 
During a 40-minute meeting at his residence in [LOC Taiz  ] , President [PER Saleh  ] confirmed to D/D [PER CIA Kappes  ] his intention to permit [MISC Yemenis  ] to enter the [MISC Saudi  ] rehab program upon their release from [LOC Guantanamo  ] , an issue that he said he will discuss King [PER Abdullah  ] during a visit to [LOC Riyadh  ] on May 31 . 
[PER Saleh  ] also ranked the threats to [MISC Yemen’s  ] security in the following order: [ORG AQAP  ] , the [MISC Houthi  ] rebellion , and the [ORG Southern Movement  ] , all of which he suggested were being driven by external forces . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) D/D [PER Kappes  ] and his traveling party , accompanied by the Ambassador and PolMil chief , flew on May 28 to [LOC Taiz  ] , some 200 km south of [LOC Sana’a  ] , in a [MISC Yemeni  ] [ORG Air Force M-171  ] helicopter , to meet with President [PER Saleh  ] at his quarters there . 
[PER Saleh  ] appeared relaxed , greeting his visitors in an open-collar white shirt and dark trousers . 
( [ORG Note:  ] over [ORG Saleh’s  ] left eye were visible the traces of a cut he suffered mid-May in a fall on the deck of the swimming pool at the [LOC Presidential Palace  ] in [LOC Sana’a  ] . 
End note . 
) After opening pleasantries , [PER Saleh  ] referred to the ongoing debate in the [LOC U.S.  ] regarding the closure of the [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] detention facility , especially criticism of the plan to transfer some detainees into [LOC U.S.  ] prisons , noting that “we have agreed to send [MISC Yemenis  ] to [MISC Saudi  ] [PER Arabia.” Kappes  ] said he understood [ORG POTUS  ] was very grateful for [ORG Saleh’s  ] support in this matter , and added that details of the prisoner transfer to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] were being worked out . 
[PER Saleh  ] said that he would discuss the issue with King [PER Abdullah  ] when he travelled to [LOC Riyadh  ] on May 31 . 
( [ORG Note:  ] We understand that [ORG GCC  ] foreign ministers also will meet in [LOC Riyadh  ] next week and that , on the margins of that meeting , they will convene a separate session on [LOC Yemen  ] , to which Foreign Minister [PER Qirbi  ] has been invited .

) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) [PER Saleh  ] then noted what he characterized as an “agreement” by the [ORG Bush Administration  ] to finance construction of an extremist rehabilitation facility in [LOC Yemen  ] , the estimated cost of which is $11M . 
[PER Saleh  ] expressed his understanding that the [MISC Yemeni  ] detainees would be placed first in the [MISC Saudi  ] rehab program and then transferred home once the facility here was built and ready to receive them . 
[PER Saleh  ] also mentioned his “appointment with President [PER Obama  ] , ” which he said the two had discussed during their recent phone call . 
As to the timing of this visit , [PER Kappes  ] suggested it was most likely that the invitation would be extended once the transfer of [MISC Yemeni  ] detainees to [ORG KSA  ] was underway . 
[PER Saleh  ] replied: “Send them all to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] now . 
They already have a facility.” <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) Turning to [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] in the [LOC Arabian Peninsula  ] ( [ORG AQAP  ] ) , [PER Kappes  ] praised cooperation between [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Yemeni  ] intelligence agencies . 
He noted that the [ORG USG  ] remains as determined as ever to destroy AQ worldwide , to which [PER Saleh  ] replied , “I hope this campaign continues and succeeds . 
We’re doing the same here . 
Our position is unshakable.” [PER Kappes  ] expressed concern that [ORG AQAP  ] was targeting [PER Saleh  ] himself , a point [PER Saleh  ] agreed with , asserting that ROYG security services had recently arrested an individual they believe was going to fire a surface-to-air missile at the [MISC Presidential  ] plane during a recent trip to [LOC Aden  ] . 
( Comment . 
We hadn’t heard of this incident previously , although there were reports of plans to attack [ORG Saleh’s  ] plane in a similar manner earlier this year as he prepared to depart [LOC Sana’a  ] for [LOC Kuwait  ] . 
End Comment . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) On current unrest in the south , [PER Saleh  ] asserted that “we are not that worried . 
This is not new . 
These are the same people who tried to break away in 1994 . 
Then , even with an army and an air force , they failed . 
They will fail again without external assistance.” He noted that one difference now is that the secessionists are exploiting international media such as [MISC Arabic-language  ] satellite channels [PER Al Jazeera  ] and [PER Al Hurra  ] . 
( [PER Note: Saleh  ] was referring to an interview with [ORG Haidar  ] al-Attas , a former southern leader , that [LOC Al-Hurra  ] aired earlier this month . 
End Note . 
) [PER Kappes  ] noted that [LOC U.S.  ] policy in support of [MISC Yemen’s  ] unity remains unchanged , and [PER Saleh  ] said that such support was “most important.” He asked that the [LOC U.S.  ] pressure other countries to do the same , referring to the [LOC U.K.  ] which , he said , is housing the movement’s leaders and providing them media access. “Leave the internal situation to us , ” [PER Saleh  ] said. “We’ll handle it.” Asserting that the military option was a last resort , he said that the ROYG strategy will rally the voices of southerners in support of unity , which he described as the majority of the population , as a counterweight to the minority in favor of independence . 
He also sought [ORG USG  ] support for ROYG efforts to persuade [ORG GCC  ] countries to permit [MISC Yemenis  ] to enter their labor markets. “Our young people need jobs , ” he said , especially if they are to be immunized against the lure of extremist ideology . 
( Comment . 
At a dinner for [PER Kappes  ] on Wednesday night , the [MISC Saudi  ] Ambassador said that his embassy has issued 36,000 visas to [MISC Yemenis  ] seeking work in [ORG KSA  ] in the last two and one-half months .

) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) [PER Kappes  ] said that the latest economic figures from [LOC Yemen  ] must be a cause for concern , a point [PER Saleh  ] didn’t dispute , characterizing the current economic situation as “very bad.” [PER Kappes  ] then asked [PER Saleh  ] to rank-order the threats to [MISC Yemen’s  ] security , noting a conversation last fall when discussion focused on [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] , the [MISC Houthi  ] rebellion and southern unrest . 
[PER Saleh  ] initially said that all three were “on the same level , ” then corrected himself to prioritize [ORG AQAP  ] as the most severe threat , followed by the [MISC Houthis  ] and then the situation in the south. “Even if we told the south tomorrow , ‘You are free to separate , ’ they would turn around the next day and start to fight with each other , ” he said , adding that such a lack of internal cohesion greatly diminished the risk to [MISC Yemen’s  ] security . 
On the other hand , he said , [ORG AQAP  ] terrorists prepared to detonate explosive vests pose a much greater risk to internal security , as does the [MISC Houthi  ] rebellion , given the external support the ROYG insists it receives from [LOC Iran  ] and [ORG Hizballah.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) Comment . 
[ORG Saleh’s  ] decision to reverse himself and characterize [ORG AQAP  ] as the most serious threat facing [LOC Yemen  ] was almost certainly taken with his [ORG USG  ] interlocutors in mind , as was , one suspects , his dismissal of the risk posed to his regime by the increasingly militant southern-independence movement . 
Nor was it coincidental that [PER Saleh  ] was quick to blame foreign powers for the nation’s woes . 
From the [LOC U.K.  ] , [LOC Qatar  ] and [LOC Libya  ] aiding the southerners , to [LOC Iran  ] and [ORG Hizballah  ] engineering the [MISC Houthi  ] rebellion in the north , to an international terrorist conspiracy fueling AQAP’s growth , the implication is that [LOC Yemen  ] is beset by forces that it will be hard-pressed to repel without substantial external support . 
This argument is , of course , also tailored to [ORG Saleh’s  ] [ORG USG  ] audience , and meant to elicit the necessary level of political , economic and military assistance to forestall [MISC Yemen’s  ] collapse , and the negative effects it would have on regional stability and security .
