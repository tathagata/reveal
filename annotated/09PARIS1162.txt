( C ) SUMMARY: Despite their proactive media blitz proclaiming [LOC Syria  ] 's " important " role in persuading [LOC Iran  ] to release [MISC French  ] citizen [PER Clotilde Reiss  ] from prison , [MISC French  ] officials admit in private they do not know what [MISC Syrian  ] President [PER Assad  ] , or his government , actually did . 
The [MISC French  ] have deliberately publicized [PER Assad  ] 's role in order to encourage [PER Assad  ] to play a more constructive intermediary role in the region , and to sew seeds of discord between [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Iran  ] . 
This [MISC French  ] media effort also aims to validate [PER Sarkozy  ] 's policy of early engagement with [LOC Syria  ] . 
In addition , [MISC French  ] officials provided a few more words of advice on handling the [MISC American  ] hostages in [LOC Iran  ] , and described the compromises they made to secure [PER Reiss  ] 's release . 
END SUMMARY . 
[ORG SYRIAN ROLE:  ] THE SPIN --------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( SBU ) Since August 11 , when a [MISC French  ] Presidency press release first singled out [LOC Syria  ] for appreciation , [MISC French  ] government officials , journalists , and academics have pondered the " important " and " influential " role [LOC Syria  ] played as " mediator " between [LOC France  ] and [LOC Iran  ] in the conflict surrounding the July 1 arrest by [MISC Iranian  ] security officers of [MISC French  ] citizen [PER Clotilde Reiss  ] ( see ref 1 ) . 
[LOC U.S.  ] mainstream media have followed suit . 
Time magazine published a story on August 17 that quoted a [MISC French  ] diplomat ( who wished to remain anonymous ) describing [MISC Syrian  ] President [PER Assad  ] 's advocacy as vindication of President [PER Sarkozy  ] 's 2008 outreach to [LOC Syria  ] , viewed at the time as premature and unmerited by many critics at home and abroad . 
" There 's some genuine ( [MISC Syrian  ] ) gratitude at work right now , " proclaimed the unnamed diplomat . 
[ORG SYRIAN ACTIONS:  ] THE JURY IS STILL OUT ------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) How did [PER Assad  ] 's purported gratitude manifest itself in this sensitive issue ? 
Despite their laudatory pronouncements , [MISC French  ] officials claim to have only a vague notion of what the [MISC Syrians  ] actually did . 
President [PER Sarkozy  ] 's [ORG Strategic Affairs Advisor Franois Richier  ] told Political Minister Counselor on August 11 , and again on August 19 , that when the [MISC French  ] released their statement , thanking the [MISC Syrians  ] , they did not know what message the [MISC Syrians  ] might have sent to [LOC Iran  ] , nor by what channels . 
[ORG MFA Syria Desk  ] Officer [PER Patrick Durel  ] on August 18 confirmed that President [PER Sarkozy  ] called [MISC Syrian  ] President [PER Assad August  ] 5 to ask for his assistance in persuading the [MISC Iranians  ] to release [PER Clotilde Reiss  ] from prison . 
[PER Assad  ] agreed to raise the matter with the [MISC Iranians  ] , and shortly thereafter he told [PER Sarkozy  ] that he had placed a call to [LOC Tehran  ] . 
[PER Assad  ] did not , however , name his interlocutor or interlocutors . 
" I 'm doing what I can to help " was the message he sent to [LOC Paris  ] , [PER Durel  ] explained . 
NEW PUBLIC POSTURE FROM [PER ASSAD  ] ? ------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Richier  ] and [PER Durel  ] suggested that the [ORG GOF  ] has sought to exaggerate the [MISC Syrian  ] role deliberately , in order to demonstrate to [LOC Syria  ] the praise they might win for playing a constructive role in the region , and in order to create tension between [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Iran  ] . 
And the [MISC French  ] believe they have succeeded on both fronts . 
As a sign that [MISC Syrians  ] welcomed the praise they received for playing a helpful part in [PER Reiss  ] 's release , [PER Durel  ] cited the absence of a public denial by [PER Assad  ] . 
In the past , [PER Assad  ] disavowed such activity . 
[PER Durel  ] explained , for instance , that [PER Assad  ] had agreed in private during July of 2008 to pass a message from [LOC Paris  ] to [LOC Tehran  ] about the dangers of the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear program , but he publicly denied having done so , declaring he did not want to play the role of intermediary . 
Moreover , according to [PER Richier  ] , the [MISC French  ] believe their reference to [MISC Syrian  ] intervention has sewn some discomfort among the [MISC Iranians  ] , whom the [MISC French  ] hear from various sources want them to " stop this stupid [LOC Syria  ] business . 
" In advance of [PER Assad  ] 's August 19 visit to [LOC Tehran  ] , the [MISC French  ] continued to tout [LOC Syria  ] 's role and encouraged him to raise the issue of [PER Clotilde Reiss  ] 's still-pending court case . 
ADVICE ON [LOC U.S.  ] HOSTAGES IN [LOC IRAN  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Both [PER Richier  ] and [ORG MFA Middle East DAS Ludovic PARIS  ] 00001162 002 OF 002 [PER Pouille  ] told us that other countries also sent messages to and applied pressure on the [MISC Iranians  ] -- most notably , [ORG EU  ] member states , [LOC Qatar  ] and [LOC Turkey  ] . 
It is unclear if [PER Reiss  ] would have been freed without such interventions , [PER Pouille  ] commented . 
[PER Richier  ] made the same point , noting that public and private messages helped shame and embarrass the [MISC Iranian  ] regime . 
He also argued that the [MISC French  ] success in painting [PER Reiss  ] as simply a young student/teacher with a keen interest in and love of [LOC Iran  ] proved a key to their success . 
[ORG FRENCH MAKE  ] COMPROMISES TO SECURE RELEASE OF [PER REISS  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Now that [PER Reiss  ] is at the [MISC French  ] Embassy in [LOC Tehran  ] , the [ORG GOF  ] plans to decrease their public pronouncements about her , according to [PER Richier  ] . 
In the discussions with the [MISC Iranians  ] on her release , the [MISC French  ] made some concessions to [MISC Iranian  ] demands , but stayed firm on certain principles . 
[PER Richier  ] said they agreed to pay of bail and to comply with an anticipated court order for [PER Reiss  ] to appear at subsequent judicial hearings . 
They also elected not to contest [PER Reiss  ] 's court-appointed lawyer , but rather to accept him and use him to carry messages . 
On the other hand , they rejected all attempts at blackmail or negotiation . 
[PER Richier  ] confirmed that the [MISC Iranians  ] did at one point raise the issue of [MISC Iranian  ] national , [PER Majid Kakavan  ] , to suggest a trade , but the [MISC French  ] refused . 
( NOTE: [PER Majid Kakavand  ] is an [MISC Iranian  ] national whom the [MISC French  ] arrested March 20 at [LOC Charles de Gaulle  ] airport on the behalf of the [ORG U.S. Department of Justice  ] on proliferation issues ( see reftel 2 ) .
