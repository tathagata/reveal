( [ORG U  ] ) Summary: [LOC Iceland  ] 's largest round of party primary elections ahead of the April 25 [ORG Althingi  ] elections were held this past weekend . 
Public calls for renewal of candidate lists did not produce the intended results and many incumbent MPs won reelection on their party lists . 
Voter turnout at the primaries was far below average , and could explain the lack of new faces . 
The primaries confirmed the arrival of a new generation of leaders on the scene as many in the old guard have announced their retirement from politics lately . 
PM [PER Sigurdardottir  ] won a large victory in the [ORG SDA  ] primary in [LOC Reykjavik  ] , which was thought to be enough push for her to declare her candidacy for the [ORG SDA  ] chair , but she has not made any announcements yet . 
Hopes that new political movements would spring up appear to be unfounded as the four largest parties rule the political landscape , but forecasts for the April 25 vote are unclear as there are still many undecided voters . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) During the weekend of March 13-15 , [LOC Iceland  ] 's four largest political parties held most of their primary elections to determine the lineup of their candidates in the upcoming parliamentary elections . 
The parties also released the results of mail-in vote primaries that took place last week . 
The results mostly confirmed the position of incumbent MPs but cleared the road for rising leaders in the two major parties . 
In the [ORG Southwest Constituency  ] , [ORG MP Arni Pall Arnason  ] ( and former Deputy Chairman of the parliamentary [ORG Foreign Affairs Committee  ] ) , won the first seat on the [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) ballot . 
His name has been tossed around as a potential future party leader . 
Prime Minister [PER Johanna Sigurdardottir  ] took the [ORG Reykjavik SDA  ] primary by storm , followed by incumbent MPs and three non-MPs in the top seats . 
[PER Sigurdardottir  ] was widely expected to declare her candidacy this week for [ORG SDA Chair  ] after this dominant showing . 
A new party leadership will be elected at the [ORG SDA  ] national congress to be held on March 26-29. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Sigurdardottir  ] 's imitation of Hamlet has taken on new significance now that several days have passed since the [LOC Reykjavik  ] primary without an announcement from the PM . 
An [ORG SDA  ] MP posited before the weekend that [PER Sigurdardottir  ] " just isn't that interested " in being party chair and would have preferred to retire at the end of the current [ORG Althingi  ] term . 
A close associate of outgoing party chair [PER Gisladottir  ] said that [PER Gisladottir  ] 's departure had been a major blow to the PM , not just to the party , and that [PER Sigurdardottir  ] had little enthusiasm for the challenge without having her close friend [PER Gisladottir  ] nearby . 
[ORG SDA  ] stalwarts have since pressured [PER Sigurdardottir  ] very publicly to change her mind ; one hundred and fifty of [PER Sigurdardottir  ] 's most fervent supporters are planning a highly publicized event where they will present her with their signatures stating their support . 
This seems to have been somewhat successful as [PER Sigurdardottir  ] now claims to be thinking about the possibility of running. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) A new generation of [ORG Independence Party  ] ( [MISC IP  ] ) leaders , MP [PER Bjarni Benediktsson  ] and [ORG MP Illugi  ] [PER Gunnarsson  ] , won the first seats in the [ORG Southwest Constituency  ] and the [ORG Reykjavik Constituency  ] , respectively . 
[PER Benediktsson  ] is the only candidate for the chair of the [MISC IP  ] after his competition , former [PER MinHealth Gudlaugur Thor Thordarson  ] , confirmed his intention not to run for chair over the weekend . 
[PER Benediktsson  ] has long been rumored to have his eyes on the chairmanship of the party . 
He is from a staunch [MISC IP  ] family , including a relative of the same name who was Prime Minister and Minister of Justice in the 1960s , as well as former Minister of Justice [PER Bjorn Bjarnason  ] , who will retire from politics this April . 
Another young [MISC IP  ] politician and possible future leader , [ORG MP Ragnheidur  ] [PER Elin Arnadottir  ] , had a dominant showing in the [ORG South Constituency  ] and leads the [MISC IP  ] list there. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Voter participation in the primaries was much lower than in 2007 , and there was only a 40-50 percent turnout in each district on average . 
In some cases this means that the election is not binding and that boards of constituent councils may change the final lineup . 
Protests here through the fall and winter have been noteworthy in calling for new candidates to declare their candidacy for the upcoming parliamentary elections . 
However , even though there were many more candidates this time compared with 2007 , the results of the primaries proved disappointing to those calling for changes since many incumbent MPs seem set to continue in office . 
Only a few newcomers from this weekend 's primaries are likely to secure a seat in the parliament . 
Perhaps the most notable of these is [ORG Tryggvi Thor Herbertsson  ] -- an economist and former economic advisor to PM Geir Haarde -- who won the second seat in the [MISC IP  ] 's primary in the [ORG Northeast Constituency.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The polling agencies are already churning out the pre-election opinion polls , with the most recent released on March 13 showing the three largest parties all running very close . 
According to the [MISC Gallup  ] poll , the [MISC IP  ] has 28.8 percent support and the [ORG SDA  ] 28.3 percent , well within the poll 's margin of error . 
The [ORG Left-Green Movement  ] has 25.7 percent support . 
The [ORG Progressive Party REYKJAVIK  ] 00000057 002 OF 002 has 12.6 percent , and the [ORG Liberal Party  ] 1.6 percent ( well below the five percent threshold needed to earn a seat in the [ORG Althingi  ] ) . 
The poll also held bad news for two new political movements , the [ORG Union of Independent Candidates  ] and the [ORG Citizens' Movement  ] , whose combined support was just over two percent . 
However , the number of undecided voters remains high at 20 percent . 
A slightly larger group said they supported the government now than did in the last [MISC Gallup  ] poll , which was conducted at the end of last month: 58.3 percent now , up from 57.1 percent in the last poll. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: Some of [LOC Iceland  ] 's foremost political commentators said that the results of this past weekend 's primaries signified an important generational shift , where many new up and coming leaders have finally been elected into the top ranks of their parties . 
However , these commentators seem to be overlooking the fact that voter turnout was very low compared to recent years . 
Moderate advertising brought on by the short campaign and hard financial times can perhaps explain this , but another convincing reason could be general voter lethargy and lack of confidence in [MISC Icelandic  ] politics . 
Recent poll results appear to support this argument since the number of undecided voters is still quite high , and the leading parties are all running very close . 
The primaries also confirmed that the [ORG Independence Party  ] is likely to maintain its trans-Atlantic outlook -- both [PER Benediktsson  ] and [MISC IP  ] Vice Chair [PER Thorgerdur Katrin Gunnarsdottir  ] , who is largely unopposed in her reelection bid , favor strong ties with the [LOC U.S.  ] To the likely disappointment of some in the [MISC IP  ] , however , they are also both strong proponents of [MISC Icelandic  ] membership in the [ORG EU  ] . 
As for the Prime Minister 's [ORG SDA  ] , the weekend 's results only increased the pressure on [PER Sigurdardottir  ] to step forward as the new party chair . 
Her reluctance to do so is palpable , but we believe the utter lack of any alternative leadership within the party will win her over in the end .
