( [ORG SBU  ] ) Key Points: --Egypt remains unwilling to associate with the [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] at this time and may not make a final decision about whether to do so until April 2010. --According to the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] ( [ORG MFA  ] ) , [LOC Egypt  ] 's concerns about the accord include a lack of information about financing for the $30 billion 2010-2012 fund and what organization will carry out verification measures for countries' promises to lower emissions --Egypt has " reservations " about the [ORG African Union  ] ( [ORG AU  ] ) 's support for the accord and will make its decision independent from the [LOC AU.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG MFA  ] First Secretary for [ORG Sustainable Development and Environmental Affairs  ] [PER Mohamed Nasr  ] told [ORG ESTH  ] officer on February 8 that [LOC Egypt  ] remains unwilling to associate with the [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] at this time ( Ref A ) . 
Noting that [LOC Egypt  ] is " not necessarily opposed , " [PER Nasr  ] explained that different government ministries continue to evaluate the accord . 
He explained that the [ORG National Committee  ] on [MISC Climate Change  ] - chaired by Environment Minister [PER Maged George  ] - and a technical group - led by Dr. [PER Mostafa Tolba  ] , a scientist and former director of the [ORG United Nations Environment Program  ] - have met regularly to review the accord . 
He then reiterated [MISC Egyptian  ] concerns about financing , emission commitments , and technology transfer mechanisms ( Ref B ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Nasr  ] said the [MISC Egyptian  ] government ( [ORG GoE  ] ) is seeking information about financial commitments to assist developing countries reduce their emissions . 
It remains unclear when and to which countries the $30 billion 2010-2012 fund will begin disbursing money . 
[PER Nasr  ] emphasized several times that [LOC Egypt  ] is not seeking financing but consider this an important element of the accord that has not been sufficiently addressed . 
He stated that Annex I countries have not laid out when they will begin supporting the fund. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Nasr  ] expressed reservations about the reporting system for countries' pledges to lower emissions . 
He said that the accord fails to specify what organization will verify which countries are fulfilling their emission commitments and also does not address the issue of compliance . 
According to the [ORG GoE  ] , there is nothing in the accord that will compel countries to report how they are lowering their commitments - this remains conditional and voluntary . 
[PER Nasr  ] noted several times during the meeting that the only legal document about climate change is the [ORG Kyoto Protocol  ] ( [ORG KP  ] ) and that [LOC Egypt  ] would prefer to see it extended five years until 2017. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In response to [ORG ESTH  ] officer inquiry about the [ORG African Union  ] ( [ORG AU  ] ) endorsement of the accord , [PER Nasr  ] again pointed out the [ORG GoE  ] 's " reservations " and stated that [LOC Egypt  ] will not be swayed by the [ORG AU  ] and will make its decision independently . 
He said that representatives from the [MISC French  ] and [MISC Canadian  ] embassies had recently urged [ORG MFA  ] officials to associate with the accord and that his office had also explained [LOC Egypt  ] 's current " wait and see " position. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Nasr  ] said he did not expect a final decision about [ORG GoE  ] support for the accord until " possibly April " but noted that this is ultimately a political decision and the timeframe may be moved up - possibly to March . 
He stated that any decision must have " political approval " from the [ORG MFA  ] and that Prime Minister [PER Ahmed Nazif  ] will announce the [ORG GoE  ] 's position on the accord . 
If [LOC Egypt  ] chooses to associate with the accord , " we will fully honor our obligations , " he said .
