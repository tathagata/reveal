Moriarty  ] . 
Reasons: 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) ------ SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The [MISC Indian  ] High Commissioner to [LOC Bangladesh  ] told Ambassador [PER Moriarty  ] on 1/13 [LOC India  ] expected improved cooperation on security and other issues with the new [ORG Awami League  ] government . 
Counterterrorism cooperation would be the central issue of discussion when the [MISC Indian  ] Minister of [ORG External Affairs  ] visits [LOC Dhaka  ] in early February . 
The High Commissioner spoke favorably of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s call for a regional task force to fight terrorism , but stressed the importance of bilateral as well as multilateral cooperation . 
The Embassy will soon propose to the Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism ( [ORG S/CT  ] ) a project to bring together civil society representatives and government officials from throughout [LOC South Asia  ] to help advance regional counterterrorism cooperation. --------------------------------------------- ----------- [LOC INDIA  ] STRESSES THE IMPORTANCE OF IMPROVED CT COOPERATION --------------------------------------------- ----------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) [MISC Indian  ] High Commissioner [PER Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty  ] expressed pleasure over the December 29 Parliamentary election landslide victory by the [ORG Awami League  ] , which traditionally had warm relations with [LOC New Delhi  ] . 
He told Ambassador [PER Moriarty  ] that improving security cooperation would be the top [MISC Indian  ] priority with the new [MISC Bangladeshi  ] government . 
[MISC Indian  ] Minister of [ORG External Affairs  ] [PER Pranab Mukherjee  ] planned to visit [LOC Dhaka  ] on February 8 for talks that would center primarily on counterterrorism issues . 
[PER Pinak  ] said the Minister would welcome Hasina’s call for a joint task force on counterterrorism . 
Although [LOC India  ] would prefer a primarily bilateral engagement , [LOC India  ] understood that [LOC Bangladesh  ] might insist on a regional task force to provide [PER Hasina  ] political cover from allegations she was too close to [LOC India  ] . 
Either way , the High Commissioner stressed the importance that the task force be action-oriented and not become yet another regional talk shop . 
( [ORG Note: India  ] frequently argues that international [MISC Islamic  ] terrorists use [LOC Bangladesh  ] as a safe haven and often cross its porous border into [LOC India  ] for bombing and other attacks . 
[LOC New Delhi  ] also says [LOC Dhaka  ] should do more to uproot [MISC Indian  ] domestic extremist groups , including the [ORG United Liberation Front of Assam  ] , that use [LOC Bangladesh  ] as a safe haven . 
End note . 
) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) Ambassador [PER Moriarty  ] said the [ORG U.S. Government  ] understood the need for regional counterterrorism cooperation and was considering “Track Two” programs in which civil society would promote closer coordination among [MISC South Asian  ] nations . 
[PER Pinak  ] said such programs were “always welcome.” The High Commissioner also responded positively when the Ambassador suggested [PER Hasina  ] should consider appointing a counterterrorism czar whose job would be to improve coordination among the many [MISC Bangladeshi  ] agencies with security responsibilities . 
[PER Pinak  ] also agreed when the Ambassador argued the [PER Hasina  ] government should not disband the [ORG Rapid Action Battalion  ] ( [ORG RAB  ] ) . 
( [ORG Note:  ] The [ORG RAB  ] has emerged as the country’s premier counterterrorism force but is viewed with suspicion by some [ORG Awami League  ] leaders because it was established by the rival [ORG Bangladesh Nationalist Party  ] . 
End note . 
) The Ambassador stressed that the [ORG USG  ] had started human rights training for [ORG RAB  ] . 
He added that the [ORG RAB  ] was the enforcement organization best positioned to one day become a [MISC Bangladeshi  ] version of the [ORG U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.  ] --------------------------------------------- -- TRANSPORTATION , ENERGY AND ECONOMIC COOPERATION --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Pinak  ] recounted that in a meeting with Sheikh [PER Hasina  ] immediately after the elections she expressed a desire to invest heavily in Bangladesh’s moribund railway system . 
This included reconnecting the [MISC Bangladeshi  ] railroad system to [LOC Agartala  ] , the capital of the bordering [MISC Indian  ] state of [LOC Tripura  ] . 
[PER Pinak  ] noted he had also met the new Water Resources Minister , [PER Romesh Chandra Sen  ] , on 12/13 . 
( [ORG Note:  ] [MISC Bangladeshi  ] media reported the following day that the [ORG Bangladesh-India Joint Rivers Commission  ] would likely meet soon to try and resolve simmering disputes over sharing the water of rivers that flow from [LOC India  ] into [LOC Bangladesh  ] . 
End note . 
) The High Commissioner also said [LOC India  ] would offer to sell up to 250 [LOC DHAKA  ] 00000057 002 OF 002 megawatts of power from a new 750-megawatt plant near [LOC Agartala  ] to [LOC Bangladesh  ] , which suffers from chronic energy shortages . 
He acknowledged , however , the cost of the electricity had yet to be negotiated , and [LOC Bangladesh  ] would have to build costly infrastructure to connect the plant with its national power grid . 
[PER Pinak  ] predicted [MISC Indian  ] companies would be interested in investing in [LOC Bangladesh  ] under the new [ORG Awami League  ] government . 
Investment from information technology firms would depend in part on their ability to train local employees and [MISC Bangladeshi  ] government support through activities such as the creation of technology centers. --------------------------------------------- --------- COMMENT: BRIGHTER DAYS FOR AN OFTEN ROCKY RELATIONSHIP --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The [ORG Awami League  ] victory augers well for a bilateral relationship that often founders on New Delhi’s charges that [LOC Bangladesh  ] does not do enough to fight terrorists who target [LOC India  ] . 
Sheikh Hasina’s immediate call for a regional counterterrorism task force and India’s initial positive response suggest a strong possibility of enhanced cooperation on this issue of huge importance to [LOC U.S.  ] interests . 
It also creates a better environment for the [ORG USG  ] to encourage counterterrorism cooperation in [LOC South Asia  ] in accordance with the goals set by the [ORG Regional Security Initiative  ] conference held in [LOC New Delhi  ] in August 2008 ( Reftel A ) . 
To build on this momentum , Embassy [LOC Dhaka  ] will propose to [ORG S/CT  ] the use of [ORG Nonproliferation  ] , [ORG Antiterrorism  ] , [ORG Demining  ] and Related Projects funds for a program to bring together [MISC South Asian  ] civil society representatives and government officials to encourage security cooperation ( Reftel B ) .
