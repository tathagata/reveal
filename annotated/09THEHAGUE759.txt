Mann  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) SUMMARY: [MISC Dutch  ] cabinet deliberations on [LOC Afghanistan  ] are stalled going into the holiday break , with no clear indication when the impasse will be broken . 
[MISC Dutch  ] post-2010 commitments to [LOC Afghanistan  ] are being held hostage to the [ORG Labor Party  ] 's ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) uncompromising stance . 
Ambassador 's engagement with key leaders reveals few new assessments: [MISC Dutch  ] will likely stay in [LOC Afghanistan  ] focusing on training , enablers and development - outside of [LOC Uruzgan  ] . 
END SUMMARY CABINET MEETINGS SIGNAL NEW LOW IN DELIBERATIONS --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) A sextet of ministers devoted their " " mini " " cabinet meetings to [LOC Afghanistan  ] December 09 and 15 . 
The sextet consists of Prime Minister [PER Jan Peter Balkenende  ] ( [PER Christian Democrats  ] ( [ORG CDA  ] ) ) , Foreign Minister [PER Maxime Verhagen  ] ( [ORG CDA  ] ) , Finance Minister/Deputy Prime Minister [PER Wouter Bos  ] ( [ORG Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) ) , Defense Minister [PER Eimert van Middelkoop  ] ( [PER Christian Unie  ] ( [ORG CU  ] ) ) , Development Cooperation Minister [PER Bert Koenders  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) , and Youth and Families Minister/Deputy Prime Minister [PER Andre Rouvoet  ] ( [ORG CU  ] ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) The cabinet has not released any public information following the meetings . 
[PER Verhagen  ] 's private secretary told the [ORG Embassy Balkenende  ] , for the first time in a cabinet meeting , made a " " heartfelt pitch " " for staying in [LOC Uruzgan  ] on December 9 . 
The private secretary was not optimistic , however , about the future of the [LOC Uruzgan  ] mission because the [ORG PvdA  ] 's political " " stranglehold " " was still in place . 
The cabinet reviewed three options: a substantially reduced [LOC Uruzgan  ] presence , a training mission outside [LOC Uruzgan  ] , and a PRT outside [LOC Uruzgan  ] . 
Chief of Defense Staff apparently provided broad outlines of these scenarios at the December 15 meeting . 
[MISC DUTCH  ] KEY LEADER ASSESSMENTS ---------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) [ORG PvdA  ] - [PER Bos  ] has completely shunned the diplomatic corps , relegating [LOC Afghanistan  ] discussions to [PER Koenders  ] who has categorically said the [MISC Dutch  ] will not be in [LOC Uruzgan  ] after 2010 except for development efforts . 
The [MISC Australian  ] Ambassador met with [ORG PvdA  ] Foreign Affairs spokesperson [PER Martijn van Dam  ] who was even more unyielding on the [LOC Uruzgan  ] departure . 
He stated that if [MISC Dutch  ] security was needed in [LOC Uruzgan  ] for development efforts after 2010 , then the [MISC Dutch  ] would simply stop those efforts as well . 
The [ORG PvdA  ] defense spokesperson opined that it would not be of any benefit for [LOC U.S.  ] leaders to engage either [PER Bos  ] or van [PER Dam  ] as they were not " " open-minded " " on [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The [ORG PvdA  ] is a party in disarray ; their December 12 party congress was very mixed . 
Although there was no formal party statement made on [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [ORG Labor  ] 's position remained clear - it was standing firm on withdrawal of all troops from [LOC Uruzgan  ] in <a id='par2010' href='#par2010'>¶</a>2010 . 
[PER Bos  ] has stated he wants a Cabinet decision around January 8 , before the [ORG Davids Commission  ] issues it report about the political support the [ORG Dutch Government  ] gave the [LOC U.S.  ] decision to attack [LOC Iraq  ] in 2003 . 
Press commentary after the party congress heavily criticized Labor for failing to recognize: ( 1 ) any positive developments in [LOC Uruzgan  ] over the past two years ; ( 2 ) the importance for the [MISC Dutch  ] to support the new [ORG NATO  ] strategy and mission ; and ( 3 ) the lives lost Qthe new [ORG NATO  ] strategy and mission ; and ( 3 ) the lives lost needlessly and effort wasted if the [MISC Dutch  ] withdrew from [LOC Uruzgan.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) [ORG CDA  ] - [PER Verhagen  ] told the Ambassador December 11 he thought the cabinet planned to have a decision prior to the late January [ORG London Conference  ] on [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Verhagen  ] did not provide any new insight on what a final cabinet decision will entail . 
He and [ORG CDA  ] parliamentary floor leader [PER Pieter van Geel  ] told the Ambassador the [ORG CDA  ] MPs were not enthusiastic about continuing in [LOC Uruzgan  ] past 2010 , but would support any decision by the cabinet . 
[PER Verhagen  ] was not optimistic about what the cabinet would ultimately decide but he remained committed to serious [MISC Dutch  ] involvement in [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) [ORG CU  ] - [PER Van Middelkoop  ] told the Ambassador that discussions within the cabinet had been " " frustrating . 
" " The THE HAGUE 00000759 002 OF 003 military leadership do not want to leave [LOC Afghanistan  ] and are clearly concerned about being the " " odd man out " " within [ORG NATO  ] as many other countries are stepping up their commitments . 
[PER Van Middelkoop  ] appears to support a serious commitment but does not see a way around the impasse caused by the intransigence of the [LOC PvdA.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) Opposition parties - [PER Anouchka van Miltenburg  ] ( [ORG Liberal Party  ] - [ORG VVD  ] ) , Chair of the [ORG Defense Committee  ] , told the Ambassador that the debate has everything to do with local politics and almost nothing to do with statesmanship . 
She said the [ORG PvdA  ] will clearly put the government into a crisis over the decision if pressed by [ORG CDA  ] . 
She sees no way to avoid that other than to compromise on a mission of some nature outside of [LOC Uruzgan  ] . 
[ORG VVD  ] party leader [PER Mark Rutte  ] told the Ambassador December 14 his party would support staying in [LOC Uruzgan  ] . 
He speculated that if the cabinet went to a crisis over the issue the end result may be a coalition of [ORG VVD  ] , [ORG CDA  ] , [ORG D-66  ] and [ORG CU  ] resulting in more serious support of [MISC NATO-led  ] operations . 
[PER Alexander Pechtold  ] , [ORG D66  ] party leader , told Ambassador December 16 his party would support retention of a PRT and force protection in [LOC Uruzgan  ] . 
He suggested a cabinet crisis was not in any of the coalition partner 's interest . 
[PER Pechtold  ] believes the cabinet decision will be delayed as long as possible to distance a decision from the recent public comments to give them room to maneuver . 
In a meeting with [LOC POL/ECON Counselor  ] , [PER Mariko Peters  ] , the [ORG GreenLeft  ] party spokesperson for defense and foreign affairs ( and former [ORG DCM  ] at the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Kabul  ] ) , said her party would support continued [MISC Dutch  ] involvement in [LOC Afghanistan  ] if it focused on community policing , even if [MISC Dutch  ] police trainers needed [MISC Dutch  ] troops to provide force protection to do their job . 
[PER Geert Wilders  ] of the [ORG Freedom Party  ] ( [ORG PVV  ] ) told the Ambassador December 10 the [ORG Labor Party  ] had painted itself into a corner with no way out . 
It was in a lose-lose situation . 
It would probably agree to stay in [LOC Afghanistan  ] someplace other than [LOC Uruzgan  ] , but that would not placate its followers . 
[PER Wilders  ] supports the [ORG NATO  ] mission in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and praised the President 's new strategy , but his party wants all [MISC Dutch  ] troops to be withdrawn , " " it is time for others to step up and assume their responsibilities . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] have done enough . 
" " JOINT EFFORTS ------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) The results of the Ambassador 's meetings with the party leaders are the same as those undertaken by the [MISC British  ] , [MISC Australian  ] and [MISC Danish  ] Ambassadors . 
Comparing notes reinforced the overwhelming support of the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister for a continued [LOC Uruzgan  ] deployment , but frustration as arguments fall on deaf ears in the [ORG PvdA  ] . 
The [ORG PvdA  ] shows no realization of the impact a lack of significant commitment by the [MISC Dutch  ] will have on their international stature . 
They also fail to grasp the overall costs and loss of credibility from leaving a successful PRT and establishing a completely new mission in a new location as Labor has proposed as an alternative . 
The [MISC British  ] embassy has forwarded a suggestion that Foreign Secretary [PER David Miliband  ] , a Labor leader , contact [PER Bos  ] on a party-to-party basis to discuss [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The [MISC Danish  ] Ambassador believes that as Qdiscuss [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The [MISC Danish  ] Ambassador believes that as a small country with the same issues as the [MISC Dutch  ] she can argue a different angle that may be helpful in urging the [MISC Dutch  ] forward . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) [PER Karel van Oosterom  ] , the Prime Minister 's Foreign Affairs and [ORG Defense Advisor  ] ( [ORG NSA  ] equivalent ) , told visiting [ORG EUR/WE Office  ] Director [PER Maureen Cormack  ] the cabinet was faced with finding consensus between the [ORG PvdA  ] 's absolute refusal to countenance an additional military mission in [LOC Uruzgan  ] and the [ORG CDA  ] 's insistence that the [LOC Netherlands  ] make a significant contribution to [ORG NATO  ] 's mission in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
He recognized it was in no one 's interest to bring the cabinet to crisis because of the important work the cabinet still needed to do . 
While mindful of [PER Bos  ] 's Jan. 8 date , [PER Verhagen  ] 's eye on the [ORG London Conference  ] and [ORG Parliament  ] 's desire for a decision by March 1 , [PER van Oosterom  ] said the Prime Minister will take whatever time is necessary to achieve the best result . 
[ORG PvdA  ] Minister [PER Koenders  ] told the [MISC Australian  ] Ambassador that Labor , with [PER Bos  ] 's blessing , could support continued development THE HAGUE 00000759 003 OF 003 efforts through the PRT in [LOC Uruzgan  ] ( leaving 12 or so civilian development officers behind in [LOC Tarin Kowt  ] with force protection provided by some other country ) , enablers , a force of as many as 500 soldiers deployed elsewhere in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and an increased financial contribution for development and training efforts . 
Given Labor 's refusal to consider other options , that may be the best we can hope for . 
END COMMENT .
