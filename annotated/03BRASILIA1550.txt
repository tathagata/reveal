( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary . 
In the run-up to USTR [PER Zoellick  ] 's May 27-28 visit , debate has intensified publicly , within the [ORG GoB  ] , and perhaps most of all in the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] , on [LOC Brazil  ] 's participation in the [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations . 
A number of policy options are reportedly under consideration , including delay or reformulation of the [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations , and tying the [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations to a parallel , more limited four-plus-one ( Mercosul-U.S . 
) agreement . 
[ORG FTAA  ] skeptics within [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Ministry of Foreign Relations  ] ( [ORG Itamaraty  ] ) appear pitted against certain other ministries , such as Finance , Agriculture and to some extent the [ORG Ministry of Development  ] , which favor a more forward leaning [ORG GoB  ] posture in the [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations . 
President [PER Lula  ] is expected to convene an interministerial meeting to forge a policy consensus before USTR [PER Zoellick  ] 's arrival . 
[ORG Itamaraty  ] has indicated that USTR [PER Zoellick  ] should be prepared to discuss the possibility of a four-plus-one negotiation during his meeting with Minister [PER Amorim  ] on May 28 . 
End Summary . 
Who 's In [LOC Charge  ] ? --------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Despite campaign rhetoric asserting that the [ORG FTAA  ] would result in [LOC Brazil  ] 's " annexation " to the [LOC United States  ] , President [PER Lula  ] after assuming power quickly committed to continuing negotiations in good faith . 
However , the [ORG GoB  ] 's commitment to the negotiations came under new question following [LOC Brazil  ] 's decision not to submit initial offers in the areas of services , investment and government procurement according to the previous negotiation schedule . 
Since then , the internal policy debates have plainly intensified. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Major re-casting of the [ORG GoB  ] 's official attitudes could be on the way . 
Reorganization and personnel changes within [ORG Itamaraty  ] have placed officials with known anti-FTAA sentiments in apparent de facto control of [LOC Brazil  ] 's negotiating team . 
Leading this group is [PER Samuel Pinheiro Guimaraes  ] , currently the number two at [ORG Itamaraty  ] as Secretary-General . 
[PER Pinheiro Guimaraes  ] was exiled to an SIPDIS academic sinecure by then- Foreign Minister [PER Celso Lafer  ] during the previous administration because of his outspoken public posture against the [ORG FTAA  ] . 
Guimaraes' advisor , [PER Regis Percy Arslanian  ] , was part of the [MISC Brazilian  ] delegation attending the recent [ORG Trade Negotiating Committee  ] meeting in [LOC Puebla  ] , [LOC Mexico  ] ; [PER Arslanian  ] was DCM of [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Washington  ] until 2001. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In what appears to be a consolidation of control , in early May , responsibility for [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations was removed from [PER Clodoaldo Hugueney  ] , Undersecretary General for Integration , Economy and [ORG Trade Affairs  ] and previously co-chair of the [ORG FTAA  ] at the vice- ministerial level along with [ORG DUSTR Peter Allgeier  ] . 
In the move , [ORG FTAA  ] as well as Mercosul-EU negotiations were shifted to [ORG Itamaraty  ] 's new Undersecretariat for [LOC South America  ] Affairs ( ref a ) , headed by [PER Luiz Felipe Macedo Soares  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] 's former Ambassador to [LOC Mexico  ] . 
On May 14 , [PER Hugueney  ] 's assistant , [PER Pompeu Neto  ] , implied that [PER Hugueney  ] was removed because of his pro-FTAA views ; [PER Hugueney  ] had argued unsuccessfully that [LOC Brazil  ] should comply with the schedule for initial offers. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) On May 16 , [ORG Itamaraty  ] announced that [PER Adhemar Bahadian  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] 's Consul General in [LOC Buenos Aires  ] and a personal friend of Minister [PER Amorim  ] and [PER Pinheiro Guimaraes  ] , would take over the [ORG FTAA  ] co-chair responsibilities . 
[PER Bahadian  ] is reported to have extensive trade experience including negotiations under GATT , work at the [ORG World Intellectual Property Organization  ] and he served as [PER Amorim  ] 's alternate in the [ORG WTO  ] from 2000 to 2002 . 
[PER Bahadian  ] was a [MISC Brazilian  ] point person on Summit of the [ORG Americas  ] in the late nineties and has served a total of ten years at the [ORG United Nations  ] . 
He was an [ORG Embassy  ] contact while he was Chief of Staff for the Secretary General from 1994 to 1996 . 
[PER Carlos Alberto Simas Magalhaes  ] will remain [LOC Brazil  ] 's lead [ORG FTAA  ] negotiator , a position to which he was named in February by the new [ORG GoB  ] . 
Internal Policy Debate -------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Pinheiro Guimaraes'  ] evidently ascending role over [ORG FTAA  ] policy within [ORG Itamaraty  ] does not bode well for close , collaborative efforts on [ORG FTAA  ] . 
[PER Neto  ] expressed to us his judgment that the intellectual formation of [PER Pinheiro Guimaraes  ] and his allies dates back to the seventies and is characterized by suspicion that the [LOC United States  ] aims to dominate the hemisphere , as well as by an inward-focus relating to economic development . 
Despite the economic benefits that [LOC Brazil  ] could gain through an [ORG FTAA  ] , [PER Neto  ] claims that these decision-makers are guided by their suspicion and ideological aversion to projects supported by the [LOC United States.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) In a strange twist , other ministries within the government now seem to be out in front of [ORG Itamaraty  ] on trade liberalization . 
After Finance Minister [PER Palocci  ] 's recent trip to [LOC Washington  ] , press reported ( and [PER Neto  ] has confirmed to us ) that the [ORG Finance Ministry  ] has been trying to insert itself more into trade deliberations out of concern over [ORG Itamaraty  ] 's faltering support for the [ORG FTAA  ] . 
Chief of Staff [MISC Dirceu  ] confirmed to Ambassador during their May 6 meeting that President [PER Lula  ] intends to convene a meeting with ministers prior to USTR [PER Zoellick  ] 's arrival in order to arrive at a single [ORG GoB  ] position regarding trade strategy . 
[ORG FTAA Policy Options  ] -------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As reported in reftel , [ORG Itamaraty  ] interlocutors claim that proceeding with the [ORG FTAA  ] status quo is untenable for [LOC Brazil  ] , given the current impasse in [ORG WTO Doha Development Agenda  ] ( [ORG DDA  ] ) negotiations , the absence of key [MISC Brazilian  ] issues within the scope of [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations , and public hostility toward the [ORG FTAA  ] . 
Specifically , they point to the unwillingness of the [LOC United States  ] to negotiate new disciplines covering domestic support for agriculture and unfair trade remedies within the [ORG FTAA  ] , and the [LOC U.S.  ] market access offers for goods , which were least favorable for Mercosul , as limiting their political flexibility to move forward in negotiations. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Therefore , the [ORG GoB  ] is considering and will likely propose to USTR [PER Zoellick  ] a new approach toward bilateral trade relations and/or reformulation of the [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations . 
Local press has identified the following policy options as under consideration: --negotiation of a [MISC U.S.-Mercosul  ] ( four-plus-one ) agreement is the most often cited option . 
[PER Antonio Simoes  ] , Economic Adviser to Foreign Minister [PER Amorim  ] , has conveyed that USTR [PER Zoellick  ] should be prepared to discuss this possibility during his meeting with [PER Amorim  ] on May 28 . 
[ORG Itamaraty  ] interlocutors stress that the four-plus-one would be narrow in scope , perhaps limited to tariff-only , and especially that it would be supplemental to [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations , not in lieu of. --a reformulation of the [ORG FTAA  ] to focus on tariffs , leaving contentious issues for negotiation within the [ORG WTO  ] . 
The [ORG GoB  ] is concerned that certain investment and government procurement rules sought by the [LOC United States  ] would limit [LOC Brazil  ] 's ability to pursue an economic development strategy utilizing industrial policies. --bifurcation of the [ORG FTAA  ] process into two stages - the first stage of tariff-only negotiations to be completed by 2005 with subsequent launching of negotiations on the remaining issues . 
[PER NOTE: However  ] , once tariff negotiations are complete , there would be no guarantee that [LOC Brazil  ] would feel compelled to participate in negotiations in the areas it has identified as problematic . 
END NOTE. --seeking a delay in the end date of the [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations until 2007 . 
Proponents argue that progress cannot be made in the [ORG FTAA  ] until the thorny issues of domestic support and unfair trade remedies are dealt with in the [ORG DDA  ] negotiations , which are unlikely to conclude by 2005. --the more remote possibility of a [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] supplemental negotiation . 
We judge it unlikely that [LOC Brazil  ] would pursue such an option at this time , particularly since [PER Nestor Kirchner  ] , [LOC Argentina  ] 's President-elect , reaffirmed [LOC Argentina  ] 's solidarity with [LOC Brazil  ] 's intention to strengthen Mercosul during his trip to [LOC Brasilia  ] May 8 . 
Implications --------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Itamaraty  ] interlocutors have stressed that all options , even ones they are not promoting , involve continuation of [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations . 
However , cynics warn that delay of the process or reformulation of the negotiations are only more subtle ways of deliberately undermining the [ORG FTAA  ] and leading to its eventual demise. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) If the [LOC United States  ] does not agree to any alteration of [ORG FTAA  ] substance or process , or to the pursuit of a " supplemental " [MISC U.S.-Mercosul  ] agreement , post believes that a " do nothing " strategy by the [ORG USG  ] would not precipitate an immediate withdrawal of [LOC Brazil  ] from the [ORG FTAA  ] . 
However , it would likely lead to a hardening of [MISC Brazilian  ] positions as it seeks to slow down the process and elicit support from other [ORG FTAA  ] countries on contentious issues such as domestic support disciplines. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Complicating [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG FTAA  ] analysis is its domestic political scene . 
Although [PER Lula  ] has widespread support to undertake thorny social security and tax reform , as the administration moves forward with its specific proposals , the debate is bound to become more polarized . 
Five months into the administration , the government is also walking a fine line between kudos from the market on its stringent macroeconomic policies and the political backlash that may emerge due to the scarcity of resources for social spending that these policies yield . 
On top of that , [ORG PT  ] radicals , supported by some intellectuals and religious leaders , are pressing the government for a referendum on continuing with the [ORG FTAA  ] . 
The [ORG GoB  ] would be politically hard pressed at this time to take on additional enemies in support of the currently envisioned [MISC FTAA.  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) According to [PER Neto  ] , the [PER Pinheiro Guimaraes  ] group is convinced that [LOC Brazil  ] 's negotiating position is stronger in a bilateral ( 4 1 ) than in a regional negotiation . 
[ORG Itamaraty  ] believes that through a four-plus-one negotiation [LOC Brazil  ] can more quickly attain market access for its key products ( [ORG OJ  ] , textiles , sugar , footwear , etc . 
) , scoring economic and political success that would make continued participation in the [ORG FTAA  ] palatable . 
Underlying this perception is the [ORG GoB  ] 's fear that the [LOC United States  ] will not come forward in the [ORG FTAA  ] with substantial , timely market access for key [MISC Brazilian  ] products . 
The policy options being considered by the [ORG GoB  ] are designed to avoid a disastrous end-of-day scenario in which [LOC Brazil  ] has negotiated issues of interest to the [LOC United States  ] ( investment , government procurement ) , and even though not getting what it needs in return , is compelled to sign the [ORG FTAA  ] because diplomatically it cannot be left outside the hemispheric pact . 
Action Request ------------------ <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In pursuing a four-plus-one negotiation , the [ORG GoB  ] may feel emboldened by [LOC U.S.  ] negotiations with other countries in the region . 
However , it seems the [ORG GoB  ] may underestimate the obstacles to providing [LOC Brazil  ] with the market access concessions it seeks on sensitive products that would be inherent in such an agreement . 
If the four-plus- one option is a non-starter from the [ORG USG  ] perspective , post would appreciate guidance from [LOC Washington  ] agencies concerning the need to subtly downplay it prior to USTR [PER Zoellick  ] 's arrival . 
When deliberating on possible [ORG USG  ] reactions to [ORG GoB  ] trade proposals , post also suggests that [LOC Washington  ] consider potential market access carrots , such as movement on some key [MISC Brazilian  ] products in the revised [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG FTAA  ] offer , to provide the [ORG GoB  ] with something tangible , but that would keep deliberations squarely within the [ORG FTAA  ] and premised on [MISC Brazilian  ] movement in all other [ORG FTAA  ] areas . 
Additionally , any forward movement on " discussing " domestic support within the [ORG FTAA  ] along the lines envisioned in instructions from the April 8-11 [ORG TNC  ] meeting in [LOC Puebla  ] could help establish for [MISC Brazilians  ] [LOC U.S.  ] sincerity in claiming that " everything is on the table " and assist in diffusing the most contentious issue for [LOC Brazil  ] in the [ORG FTAA  ] .
