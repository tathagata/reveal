( C ) SUMMARY: In a wide-ranging discussion with visiting [ORG NEA A/S  ] Feltman on December 14 , President [PER Talabani  ] underscored the importance for [MISC Kurds  ] of the [MISC POTUS/VPOTUS  ] telephone calls with [ORG Kurdistan Regional Government  ] ( [ORG KRG  ] ) President [PER Barzani  ] , the December 7 [LOC White House  ] statement on [LOC Iraq  ] 's election law and the message conveyed by Secretary of Defense Gates . 
He predicted a tough government coalition process in [LOC Iraq  ] after the March elections , dismissed the significance of the [MISC Kurdish  ] [ORG Goran  ] ( " Change " ) Movement and said the [ORG PUK  ] and [ORG KDP  ] - which will again run on a united [MISC Kurdish  ] list - had agreed with PM [PER Maliki  ] 's [ORG State of Law  ] coalition to try to form a front as part of a government coalition after elections . 
On [LOC Iran  ] ( " a very difficult country " ) , [PER Talabani  ] said the domestic political situation is highly unstable and the regime 's leadership paralyzed: Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] fears further alienating the [MISC Iranian  ] street , but is hemmed in by regime hardliners and cannot afford to appease the opposition , either . 
[LOC Iran  ] 's multi-ethnic population and the [ORG Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps'  ] ( [ORG IRGC  ] ) efforts to expand its writ posed additional challenges for the regime . 
While [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Iran  ] agreed on much , [LOC Syria  ] 's attempts to resuscitate [LOC Iraq  ] 's [ORG Ba'th Party  ] ( a mistake , in [PER Talabani  ] 's view ) worried [LOC Tehran  ] . 
[PER Talabani  ] said [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] 's effort to re-tether [LOC Syria  ] to the broader [MISC Arab  ] community had prompted closer [MISC Egyptian-Iraqi  ] ties . 
The [MISC Saudi  ] effort to isolate [LOC Iraq  ] from its regional neighbors was " misguided " , but given the personal enmity between [PER King Abdullah  ] and PM [PER Maliki  ] , [MISC Saudi-Iraqi  ] rapprochement was unlikely if [PER Maliki  ] won another term as PM . 
[PER Talabani  ] said [LOC Iraq  ] 's second oil bid round helped allay concerns about [LOC Iraq  ] 's credit worthiness , highlighted its potential to become a wealthy country and gave [LOC Iraq  ] a chance to rival [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] 's oil production in 10-15 years . 
End summary . 
ELECTION LAW AND SECRETARY OF DEFENSE GATES' VISIT --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Talabani  ] said [ORG KRG  ] President [PER Masoud Barzani  ] was " very pleased and satisfied " with the recent visit of Secretary of Defense Gates ( ref A ) and his reiteration of the December 7 [LOC White House  ] statement on the [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to [LOC Iraq  ] 's constitution ( including [ORG Article  ] 140 ) , support for a census and pledge to help resolve outstanding [MISC Arab-Kurd  ] issues . 
[PER Talabani  ] said that while some actors in the [MISC Iraqi Kurdistan Region  ] ( [ORG IKR  ] ) claimed the [MISC Kurds  ] were " deceived " into settling for 43 parliamentary seats as part of the recently-completed election law deal ( ref B ) , he and [PER Barzani  ] believed long-term relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] , as manifested in the [LOC White House  ] statement and the [ORG SecDef  ] 's message , were more important than an additional 2-3 parliamentary seats . 
A/S Feltman underscored the [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to resolve outstanding [MISC Arab-Kurd  ] issues in accordance with [LOC Iraq  ] 's constitution and [ORG Article  ] 140. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Talabani  ] noted that " some [MISC Kurds  ] " failed to understand that [ORG Article  ] 142 stipulates that any proposed changes to the constitution cannot impinge on rights otherwise guaranteed to the provinces . 
( [PER Comment: Mentioned  ] in the [LOC White House  ] statement of December 7 , [ORG Article  ] 142 provides a mechanism for amending the constitution . 
In [LOC Qprovides  ] a mechanism for amending the constitution . 
In mentioning it , [PER Talabani  ] likely intended to caution that any attempt to amend the constitution in a way that limited Kurds' rights to resolve DIBs issues under [ORG Article  ] 140 would be unacceptable . 
End comment . 
) While the [MISC Bush  ] administration had been " very friendly " toward the [MISC Kurds  ] , it had never publicly expressed support for [MISC Kurdish  ] interests , [PER Talabani  ] said . 
( Note: He claimed former VP [PER Cheney  ] committed to doing so after [LOC Iraq  ] adopted hydrocarbons legislation , which has still not occurred . 
End note ) . 
[MISC Kurds  ] were " very glad " about the [PER POTUS/VPOTUS-Barzani  ] calls and December 7 [LOC White House  ] statement , which represented a commitment by the [LOC U.S.  ] to them . 
( Note: As reported ref C , [MISC Kurdish  ] , [MISC Arab  ] and Turkoman interlocutors have publicly and privately expressed the fears that the [MISC POTUS/VPOTUS  ] calls , together with the December 7 statement , represent a deal by which the [ORG KRG  ] agreed to accept a consensus election law agreement in exchange for [LOC U.S.  ] support of a process that would lead to the eventual annexation of [LOC Kirkuk  ] into the [ORG IKR  ] . 
End note . 
) [LOC BAGHDAD  ] 00003316 002 OF 005 GOVERNMENT FORMATION - " THEN WE'LL HAVE PROBLEMS " --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) While the negotiating for a consensus agreement on an election law compromise had been difficult , [PER Talabani  ] claimed delaying the election until March would mitigate weather-related complications during the polling . 
After that would come the effort to form a coalition government . 
" Then we will have problems " , [PER Talabani  ] predicted . 
( Note: Responding to Ambassador [PER Hill  ] 's question about whether [MISC Iraqi  ] [ORG Kurdistan Parliament  ] Speaker Dr. [PER Kamal Kirkuki  ] would participate in the [ORG Kurdish Alliance List  ] 's negotiating team , [PER Talabani  ] characterized [PER Kirkuki  ] as " a foolish man " and joked that he was not really a doctor , not really named [PER Kamal  ] and was not actually from [LOC Kirkuk  ] , as his surname suggested . 
End note . 
) Responding to A/S [PER Feltman  ] 's question about whether government formation negotiations would be over the position of the president or the presidency ( encompassing the president and two vice-presidents ) , [PER Talabani  ] said that in accordance with the [MISC Iraqi  ] constitution , they would only pertain to the office of the president . 
Referring to VP al-Hashimi 's unhelpful veto of the November 8 election law , [PER Talabani  ] noted that the current arrangement by which the president and two vice presidents may veto legislation had benefits and drawbacks . 
( Note: It is unclear whether parliament will approve holding a constitutional referendum to extend the current arrangement by which the president and two vice presidents have a veto . 
End note . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Talabani  ] said in recent negotiations the [ORG PUK  ] and [ORG KDP  ] reached agreement with PM [PER Maliki  ] 's Shi'a-led [ORG State of Law Alliance  ] ( [ORG SLA  ] ) to form a front as part of a coalition government after elections . 
The bloc with the largest number of seats would nominate a candidate for PM . 
( [PER Comment: Consummation  ] of the proposed deal will likely depend on how many seats [ORG SLA  ] is able to win . 
End comment . 
) [PER Talabani  ] said the [ORG KDP  ] and [ORG PUK  ] will again run together on a united [ORG Kurdish Alliance List  ] ( [ORG KAL  ] ) . 
[PER Nawshirwan Mustafa  ] 's [PER Goran  ] ( aka , " Change " ) Movement would run on a separate list , as would the [ORG Kurdish Islamic Union and League  ] of [ORG Muslims  ] of [ORG Kurdistan  ] . 
[PER TALABANI  ] DISMISSES [PER GORAN  ] MOVEMENT'S SIGNIFICANCE --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Responding to A/S [PER Feltman  ] 's question about what [PER Goran  ] meant for [MISC Kurdish  ] internal politics , [PER Talabani  ] characterized the movement as an expression of dissatisfaction with the status quo . 
Criticizing [PER Goran  ] 's " negative agenda " , he claimed the movement lacked an organized party structure , a program and leadership . 
( Comment: As reported ref D , [PER Goran  ] largely agrees with the [ORG PUK/KDP  ] 's " national " [MISC Kurdish  ] agenda ; however , unlike the [ORG PUK/KDP  ] , [PER Goran  ] believes implementation of [ORG Article  ] 140 and progress on resolving [LOC Kirkuk  ] should be the first among them . 
End comment . 
) [PER Talabani  ] complained that although [PER Goran  ] members were part of a group of [MISC IKG  ] parliamentarians that participated in election law negotiations in [LOC Baghdad  ] , they later claimed they had been deceived into backing the compromise agreement. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Sharply criticizing [PER Goran  ] , he claimed its members were " politically immature " and did not understand politics outside the [ORG IKR  ] . 
Dismissing [PER Goran  ] 's significance for internal [MISC Kurdish  ] politics , [PER Talabani  ] claimed " thousands " who had supported the party in July 's [ORG KRG  ] parliamentary elections had been disappointed by it and were now [MISC Qelections  ] had been disappointed by it and were now leaving . 
[PER Talabani  ] claimed many of those were joining [MISC Kurdish  ] [MISC Islamic  ] parties , whose ranks were swelling , to register opposition to the existing [MISC PUK-KDP  ] bipolar order . 
IRAN: " NO SECURITY AND NO STABILITY " ------------------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) A/S [PER Feltman  ] gave the [LOC U.S.  ] assessment that the [MISC Iranian  ] regime 's failure to respond positively to elements of the October 1 proposal reflected divisions within the regime 's leadership and an inability to reach a decision on its nuclear aspirations . 
[PER Talabani  ] cautioned against ignoring " the real crisis " [LOC Iran  ] 's regime now faced . 
Opposition born of the regime 's heavy-handed response to election protests had clearly demonstrated that the regime lacked the support of a majority of [MISC Iranians  ] . 
Supreme Leader [PER Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  ] does not want to lose the sympathy of the [MISC Iranian  ] street , but " cannot afford to appease it , either . 
" [PER Talabani  ] expressed his view that recent remarks by Majlis Speaker [PER Ali Larijani  ] decrying [LOC BAGHDAD  ] 00003316 003 OF 005 " plots " against [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program also constrained [PER Khamenei  ] 's room for maneuver and threw into stark relief the internal political crisis the regime faces . 
There is " no security and no stability in [LOC Iran  ] now " , [PER Talabani  ] said . 
MULTI-ETHNIC POPULATION CHALLENGES IRAN'S REGIME --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Compounding longstanding fissures in the political landscape is [LOC Iran  ] 's multi-ethnic population , which had become an increasingly prominent source of friction , according to [PER Talabani  ] . 
Noting 14 [MISC Kurdish  ] intellectuals were recently sentenced to death for peacefully opposing the [MISC Iranian  ] regime , [PER Talabani  ] highlighted what he termed the emerging " partisan war " between the regime and ethnic [MISC Azeris  ] . 
[PER Talabani  ] flatly said there had been " interference in and falsification of " election results by the regime . 
He agreed with A/S [PER Feltman  ] 's assessment that it was unlikely reformist [ORG Mir  ] [PER Hossein Mousavi  ] had legitimately lost in his predominantly [MISC Azeri  ] home province . 
Stressing the key role [PER Mousavi  ] played during his tenure as [MISC Iranian  ] Prime Minister in developing ethnically [MISC Azeri  ] areas of [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Talabani  ] said he was genuinely popular and enjoyed wide support . 
Describing the current struggle between reformists and the regime , [PER Talabani  ] said [PER Mousavi  ] is " now engaged in a fight from which he cannot retreat " . 
[ORG IRGC  ] ANTAGONIZING [MISC IRANIAN ARMY  ] AND BAZAARIS ------------------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) A/S [PER Feltman  ] observed that [LOC Iran  ] , s [ORG Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps  ] ( [ORG IRGC  ] ) was taking advantage of political instability and the leadership 's paralysis to expand its writ . 
[PER Talabani  ] agreed , but noted that while the [ORG IRGC  ] 's leadership is united at the senior levels , divisions exist among the rank and file . 
The [ORG IRGC  ] was not popular , he said: [MISC Iranian Army  ] leaders were unhappy that the [ORG IRGC  ] , a rival for resources and influence , was expanding its domain and [MISC Iranian  ] merchants were unhappy about the [ORG IRGC  ] 's increasing involvement in economic activities . 
A/S [PER Feltman  ] underscored potential short-term dangers stemming from increased [ORG IRGC  ] influence . 
An example was the increased [ORG IRGC  ] naval presence in the [LOC Persian Gulf  ] , where the [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Iranian  ] navies had longstanding experience with each other 's operations and established bridge-to-bridge communication protocols to mitigate potential miscommunication. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Agreeing that the [ORG IRGC  ] was trying to extend its influence , [PER Talabani  ] said the [ORG IRGC  ] had to approve the appointments of most [MISC Iranian  ] ambassadors , including all those appointed to " important states " . 
He stressed the importance of differentiating between " what they ( [ORG IRGC  ] leaders ) say and what is in their hearts " . 
In their hearts , [ORG IRGC  ] leaders are afraid ; however , they adopt a maximalist public line in the belief it will help the regime reach the best possible deal with the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Europe  ] on the nuclear program and other issues . 
[PER Talabani  ] attributed significant changes in the [ORG IRGC  ] 's leadership cadre to concerns about loyalty stemming from the widely-repeated view that 70 percent of [ORG IRGC  ] officers voted for reformist former [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Mohammad Khatami  ] in 1997 , and presumably remain sympathetic to the reform movement . 
[LOC IRAN  ] " A VERY DIFFICULT COUNTRY " ------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Noting that the [LOC U.S.  ] had pursued bilateral and multilateral approaches , but had not been able to prompt [LOC Iran  ] 's regime to respond , A/S [PER Feltman  ] asked [PER Talabani  ] what QIran 's regime to respond , A/S [PER Feltman  ] asked [PER Talabani  ] what advice he might offer . 
After a long pause , [PER Talabani  ] sighed and conceded that [LOC Iran  ] is " a very difficult country " . 
While some [MISC Iranians  ] claimed nuclear weapons were un-Islamic , the regime was making " quick progress " towards acquiring nuclear weapons capability . 
[PER Talabani  ] said he believed there were more secret sites than the recently disclosed one at [LOC Qom  ] , and assessed that the [MISC Iranian  ] regime sought to approach turn-key status with respect to its ability to initiate production of nuclear weapons . 
He noted the potency of the nuclear program as a " national issue " with which the regime could rally the [MISC Iranian  ] people and deflect attention from shortcomings in domestic programs . 
Citing increased [MISC Russian  ] pressure on [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Talabani  ] said he thought [LOC U.S.  ] policies had been " wise . 
" He offered that it would be helpful if [LOC China  ] reached a similar decision with respect to its willingness to further pressure [LOC Iran  ] , and suggested that increased [MISC Iraqi  ] oil production could help mitigate [LOC BAGHDAD  ] 00003316 004 OF 005 [LOC China  ] 's dependence on [MISC Iranian  ] oil , potentially freeing [LOC China  ] to pursue a harder policy on [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program . 
IRAN-IRAQ-SYRIA RELATIONS ------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) While [MISC Iranian  ] leaders' views on individual [MISC Shi'a Iraqi  ] leaders were " not homogeneous " ( some supported former PM Jaafari , others supported PM [PER Maliki  ] ) , they are united in their desire for a [MISC Shi'a-led  ] government and fear of a resurgent [ORG Ba'th Party  ] . 
[PER Talabani  ] said a contact told him during his last visit to [LOC Iran  ] that [PER Muhammad Nassif Khayrbek  ] , the former head of [LOC Syria  ] 's [ORG General Intelligence Directorate  ] and a senior advisor to President [PER Bashar  ] al-Asad recently visited [LOC Tehran  ] and proposed that [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Syria  ] cooperate to bring [LOC Iraq  ] 's [ORG Ba'th Party  ] back to power as " a bridge between [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Syria  ] " . 
( [PER Note: Talabani  ] flew to [LOC Iran  ] on/about November 22 to appeal for the lives of [MISC Iranian  ] Kurds sentenced to death . 
End note . 
) A/S [PER Feltman  ] noted that while [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Syria  ] agree on much , a major point of divergence is [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[PER Talabani  ] agreed , noting that [LOC Syria  ] heavily supported [MISC Iraqi  ] Ba'thists , while [LOC Iran  ] opposed them . 
[LOC Syria  ] is actively working to change [MISC Iranian  ] leaders' minds ; however , [LOC Syria  ] 's support for the [ORG Iraqi National Movement  ] coalition that includes , among others , former PM [PER Ayad Allawi  ] ( secular [MISC Shi'a  ] ) and [PER Saleh al-Mutlaq  ] ( [PER Sunni  ] with Ba'thist ties ) " worried [LOC Iran  ] . 
" <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Talabani  ] said the [MISC Syrian  ] regime approached him one month ago through a friend to ask that he help mediate between [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] to reduce tensions stoked by PM [PER Maliki  ] 's accusation of [MISC Syrian  ] complicity in recent bomb attacks against [MISC GOI  ] facilities in [LOC Baghdad  ] . 
The emissary said [PER Talabani  ] should contact President [PER Bashar  ] al-Asad directly , and that [LOC Syria  ] was willing to " cease all support for action against [LOC Iraq  ] " if an accommodation could be reached . 
A/S [PER Feltman  ] noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] was trying to identify ways to improve relations with [LOC Syria  ] . 
[PER Talabani  ] stressed that if there were any improvement on the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] track , better [MISC U.S.-Syria  ] relations could be possible . 
Recalling an exchange several years ago with [PER Bashar  ] in which he asked what [LOC Syria  ] wanted from the [LOC U.S.  ] , [PER Talabani  ] said [PER Bashar  ] answered that he wanted the [LOC Golan  ] back and a stable [LOC Iraq  ] that would not work against [LOC Syria  ] , in that order . 
[PER Talabani  ] said he asked [PER Bashar  ] if the order could be reversed , pointing out that strong [MISC Syria-Iraq  ] ties could help [LOC Damascus  ] with respect to [LOC Israel  ] . 
[LOC SYRIA  ] ERRS IN TRYING TO RESTORE IRAQ'S [ORG BA'TH PARTY  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) On [LOC Syria  ] 's support for those conducting attacks in [LOC Iraq  ] , [PER Talabani  ] said [LOC Syria  ] made " a big mistake " in thinking it could return the [ORG Ba'th Party  ] to power in [LOC Iraq  ] , which was their ultimate goal . 
The nadir of [MISC Syrian-Iraqi  ] relations coincided with the period in which the [ORG Ba'th  ] ruled [LOC Damascus  ] and [LOC Baghdad  ] . 
[MISC Syrian  ] leaders wanted to play the role of " fraternal helpers " in restoring [MISC Iraqi  ] Ba'thists to power . 
[LOC Baghdad  ] 's offer to reopen pipelines , supply gas and open points of entry on the [MISC Syria-Iraq  ] border had been viewed suspiciously by [LOC Damascus  ] , which did not believe a [MISC Maliki-led  ] government would honor such commitments. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) A/S [PER Feltman  ] noted that in conversations with [LOC Syria  ] , the [ORG SARG  ] always raised [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] recently asked [LOC Syria  ] to stop broadcasts from [LOC Damascus  ] of [LOC Ba'thist-backed  ] satellite channels glorifying terrorism and violence , but had not seen any action . 
[PER Talabani  ] offered that [LOC Syria  ] was [MISC Qhad  ] not seen any action . 
[PER Talabani  ] offered that [LOC Syria  ] was waiting for the results of [LOC Iraq  ] 's upcoming elections , in which they hoped a strong [PER Sunni  ] bloc would emerge , before making any decisions on its [LOC Iraq  ] policy . 
Noting that the [ORG SARG  ] was good at collecting cards , A/S [PER Feltman  ] asked [PER Talabani  ] when they might actually play their hand . 
[PER Talabani  ] replied that while [PER Hafez al-Asad  ] had been an excellent player , [PER Bashar  ] was still young . 
Referring to [PER Bashar  ] 's leadership style , he said [MISC Arabs  ] jokingly described [LOC Syria  ] as a " [MISC Jamluka  ] " , a play on the [MISC Arabic  ] words " [MISC Jamahuriya  ] " ( [LOC Libya  ] 's " state of the masses " ) and " mamluka " ( " monarchy " ) . 
[MISC SAUDI-SYRIA  ] THAW PROMPTS CLOSER [MISC EGYPTIAN-IRAQI  ] TIES --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) A/S [PER Feltman  ] asked [PER Talabani  ] what the visit to [LOC Damascus  ] in October by [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] 's King [PER Abdullah  ] after a five-year hiatus in [MISC Saudi-Syrian  ] relations meant for [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[PER Talabani  ] laughingly said King [PER Abdullah  ] told him " You and [LOC Iraq  ] are in my hearts , but that man ( [PER Maliki  ] ) is not " . 
Citing [PER Maliki  ] 's " failed promises " to [MISC Saudi  ] leaders , [LOC BAGHDAD  ] 00003316 005 OF 005 [PER Talabani  ] said [PER Abdullah  ] and the [MISC Saudis  ] refused to deal with the PM , despite [LOC U.S.  ] attempts to mediate . 
[LOC Syria  ] , too , blamed [PER Maliki  ] for [LOC Iraq  ] 's anti-Syria policies and found it difficult to work with him . 
According to [PER Talabani  ] , [MISC Syrian  ] officials told [PER Maliki  ] during the latter 's most recent visit to [LOC Damascus  ] ( shortly before the August 19 bombings in [LOC Baghdad  ] ) that they were supporting [LOC Iraq  ] 's [ORG Ba'th Party  ] , further stoking [PER Maliki  ] 's fear of Ba'thist conspiracies against him. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [PER Talabani  ] said King [PER Abdullah  ] is trying to re-tether [LOC Syria  ] to the broader [MISC Arab  ] community , an initiative [LOC Egypt  ] opposes . 
Partly as a consequence , Egyptian-Iraqi relations had improved . 
[LOC Riyadh  ] tried to pressure [LOC Cairo  ] not to facilitate [PER Maliki  ] 's recent visit to [LOC Egypt  ] , but the visit had come off . 
A/S [PER Feltman  ] offered that King [PER Abdullah  ] 's visit to [LOC Damascus  ] and the possibility of warming ties between [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] and [LOC Syria  ] was likely a factor in encouraging [MISC Egyptian  ] ties with [LOC Iraq  ] , to help counterbalance the [MISC Saudi  ] effort . 
Noting [LOC Riyadh  ] 's important regional role , [PER Talabani  ] said [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] was actively working to prevent [LOC Iraq  ] from developing relationships with its regional neighbors , and claimed it had pressured [LOC Kuwait  ] to backtrack on initial agreements with [LOC Iraq  ] on issues dating to the [LOC Saddam-era  ] . 
Despite [MISC Saudi  ] opposition , though , [LOC Qatar  ] and [LOC Bahrain  ] were seeking improved relations with [LOC Iraq  ] . 
SAUDI-IRAQI RAPPROCHEMENT UNLIKELY IF MALIKI PM AGAIN --------------------------------------------- -------- 19 . 
( C ) [PER Talabani  ] characterized the [MISC Saudi  ] policy as misguided , noting that [LOC Iraq  ] could play a positive role in attenuating tension between the [MISC Saudi  ] government and its largely [MISC Shi'a  ] opposition . 
A/S [PER Feltman  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] would encourage the [MISC Saudis  ] to revisit their [LOC Iraq  ] policy after upcoming [MISC Iraqi  ] elections in March . 
[PER Talabani  ] offered that if [PER Maliki  ] remained PM , things would likely remain as is since the enmity was personal ; however , with a different PM - even another Shi'ite like [ORG ISCI  ] 's [PER Ammar al-Hakim  ] or [PER Allawi  ] - there was a chance for positive change . 
He cautioned that such an effort could be hurt if the [LOC Saudis'  ] efforts to support the emergence of a strong [PER Sunni  ] bloc in the [MISC Iraqi  ] parliament failed , which he thought likely. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) [PER Talabani  ] assessed [LOC Turkey  ] 's role with respect to [LOC Iraq  ] as generally good and said his relations with [LOC Turkey  ] were " excellent " . 
Noting improved relations between [LOC Ankara  ] and the KRG , he pointed to [MISC Turkish  ] FM Gul 's recent visit to [LOC Erbil  ] . 
[LOC Turkey  ] could play a positive role in the region and [LOC Ankara  ] 's policy towards [MISC Kurds  ] ( [LOC Iraq  ] ) and [PER Alawites  ] ( [LOC Syria  ] ) was generally positive , despite opposition from the [MISC Turkish  ] General Staff and some quarters of [LOC Turkey  ] 's parliament . 
He offered that [LOC Turkey  ] could play a positive role with respect to [LOC Syria  ] . 
SECOND OIL BID ROUND -------------------- <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) [PER Talabani  ] expressed surprise that companies from the [LOC U.S.  ] , which " liberated [LOC Iraq  ] and therefore earned the right " , had not won more contracts during [LOC Iraq  ] 's recently-concluded Second Petroleum Licensing Round ( " bid round " ) , held December 11-12 in [LOC Baghdad  ] . 
( Note: As reported ref E , only three of the seven pre-qualified [LOC U.S.  ] companies attended the bid round and only one ( [ORG Occidental Petroleum  ] ) submitted a bid . 
No [LOC U.S.  ] companies were awarded contracts during the second bid round ; however , [ORG ExxonMobil  ] and [ORG Occidental  ] won contracts in the first round potentially allowing them to develop nearly three million barrels per Qallowing them to develop nearly three million barrels per day of future [MISC Iraqi  ] oil production , representing nearly a third of the potential total increase in [MISC Iraqi  ] oil production from the two bid rounds . 
End note . 
) Ambassador Hill underscored that [LOC U.S.  ] oil and gas service companies were expected to garner significant business as part of the effort to increase [MISC Iraqi  ] oil production under the new contracts . 
He also noted that with the second bid round , companies from all five [MISC UNSC  ] permanent members had production contracts in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Noting that [LOC Iraq  ] 's oil production could rival [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] 's in 10-15 years , [PER Talabani  ] said the second bid round would help allay concerns about [LOC Iraq  ] 's credit worthiness and highlight its potential to become a wealthy country. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 .
