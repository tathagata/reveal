( S/NF ) [ORG Foreign Office  ] Director for Defence and [ORG Strategic Threats Simon Manley  ] informed [MISC Poloff  ] July 2 that the [ORG Foreign Office  ] would submit Foreign Secretary [PER Miliband  ] 's written statement on rendition to Parliament July 2 , for entry into Parliamentary records July 3 .

FS [PER Miliband  ] 's Written Statement on Rendition -------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) [MISC Begin Statement: Terrorist Suspects  ] ( Rendition ) On 21 February I made a statement to the [ORG House  ] regarding new information we had been passed by the [ORG US Government  ] regarding rendition . 
Contrary to earlier assurances that [PER Diego Garcia  ] had not been used for rendition flights , [LOC US  ] investigations had revealed two occasions , both in 2002 , when this had in fact occurred . 
Since February , I have corresponded with Secretary [PER Rice  ] on this issue and our officials have continued to work through the details and implications of the new information . 
I promised the [ORG House  ] that , as part of this of this ( sic ) process , my officials would compile a list of flights where we had been alerted to concern about rendition through the [LOC UK  ] or our [LOC Overseas Territories  ] . 
The list which they have compiled , containing 391 flights , reflects concerns put to us by hon . 
Members , members of the public , multilateral organisations and non-governmental organisations . 
Inclusion on this list does not represent an official endorsement of any allegations about a particular flight . 
On the contrary , [LOC US  ] government flights as with other government flights occur regularly for a variety of purposes . 
Our intention was to collate in one place those concerns that had been put to us directly . 
The list was passed to the [LOC US  ] on 15 May . 
I undertook in February to publish the list and have today placed a copy in the library of the [ORG House  ] and published it on the [ORG FCO  ] website ( www.fco.gov.uk ) . 
The [LOC United States  ] Government received the list of flights from the [LOC UK  ] Government . 
The [LOC United States  ] Government confirmed that , with the exception of two cases related to [PER Diego Garcia  ] in 2002 , there have been no other instances in which [LOC US  ] intelligence flights landed in the [LOC United Kingdom  ] , its [LOC Overseas Territories  ] , or the [LOC Crown Dependencies  ] , with a detainee on board since September 11 , 2001 . 
Our [LOC US  ] allies are agreed on the need to seek our permission for any future renditions through [LOC UK  ] territory . 
Secretary [PER Rice  ] has underlined to me the firm [LOC US  ] understanding that there will be no rendition through the [LOC UK  ] , our [LOC Overseas Territories  ] and [LOC Crown Dependencies  ] , with a detainee on board since September 11 , 2001 . 
Our [ORG US Allies  ] are agreed on the need to seek our permission for any future renditions through [LOC UK  ] territory . 
Secretary [PER Rice  ] has underlined to me the firm [LOC US  ] understanding that there will be no rendition through the [LOC UK  ] , our [LOC Overseas Territories  ] and [LOC Crown Dependencies  ] or Airspace without first receiving our express permission . 
We have made clear that we would only grant such permission if we were satisfied that the rendition would accord with [LOC UK  ] law and our international obligations . 
The circumstances of any such request would be carefully examined on a case-by-case basis . 
Our intelligence and counter-terrorism relationship with the [LOC US  ] is vital to the national security of the [LOC United Kingdom  ] . 
There must and will continue to be the strongest possible intelligence and counter-terrorism relationship between our two countries , consistent with [LOC UK  ] law and our international obligations .
