( C ) SUMMARY . 
A recent wave of protests organized by a so-called environmental group , " [ORG La Coordinadora Nacional  ] de [PER Medio Ambiente  ] ( [ORG CNMA  ] ) " , are likely part of a movement by hard-line elements of the [MISC FMLN  ] to undermine President [PER Funes  ] . 
Over the past several weeks , the [ORG CNMA  ] has carried out large-scale , coordinated protests throughout the country ostensibly protesting [ORG GOES  ] plans to continue with the construction of the hydroelectric dam " [LOC Chaparral  ] " and perceived inequities in the seed disbursement program to farmers . 
It seems that hard-line members of the [MISC FMLN  ] party are using this relatively unknown organization to vent their frustration about the direction of economic policy and directly challenge the President . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On August 26 , the [ORG CNMA  ] coordinated a sophisticated series of road blocks at nine key points in the highway system across the country in the morning hours , effectively bringing traffic to a halt . 
Many key transportation arteries were blocked off , including the [ORG Pan-American Highway  ] . 
This protest included wide-spread participation and there were reports of vandalism and destruction of property . 
Police were unable to restore order until the afternoon . 
Past [ORG CNMA  ] protests consisted of no more than small-scale demonstrations outside of the [ORG Presidential Palace.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) According to press reports , [ORG CNMA  ] is protesting President Funes' decisions to proceed with the construction of the state-owned hydroelectric dam " [LOC Chaparral  ] " and the planned cutbacks in the government-managed seed distribution program . 
In each case , only a small portion of the population is adversely affected by the policy decisions. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) COMMENT: Mass street protests are part of the traditional [MISC FMLN  ] play book and are one battlefront in an ongoing struggle for power between the orthodox [MISC FMLN  ] and President [PER Funes  ] . 
[PER Funes  ] said at a meeting Thursday August 27 that his administration will not yield to blackmail . 
There is broad public support for the need for [PER Funes  ] to prevail . 
END COMMENT .
