( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: In a January 4 meeting with [LOC Iraq  ] 's [MISC Sunni  ] Vice President [PER Tariq al-Hashemi  ] ( [ORG Iraqi Islamic Party  ] ) [ORG IIP  ] ) , the Ambassador briefed him on the new [LOC Baghdad  ] security plan and solicited the [ORG VP  ] 's support . 
[PER Al-Hashemi  ] welcomed a new plan to curb [LOC Baghdad  ] violence , requested [PER Shia  ] and [MISC Sunni  ] balance within the [ORG Iraqi Security Forces  ] ( [ORG ISF  ] ) manning checkpoints , and agreed that an increased number of [MISC MNF-I  ] troops are needed in order for the plan to succeed . 
Discussing a possible cabinet change , the [ORG VP  ] said that Prime Minister [PER Maliki  ] has not approached him about changing any of [ORG Tawafuq  ] 's ( [ORG Sunni Coalition  ] ) [ORG Ministers  ] or their Deputy Prime Minister . 
[PER Al-Hashemi  ] stressed that before [ORG Tawafuq  ] agrees to change its [ORG Ministers  ] , the Minister of [ORG Defense  ] , [PER Abdul Qadir Mohammed  ] al-Mufriji , ( [MISC Sunni  ] ) [ORG Independent  ] ) [ORG Tawafuq  ] ) must be replaced with another [ORG Tawafuq  ] candidate . 
The [ORG VP  ] criticized the way the [ORG GOI  ] executed [PER Saddam  ] and expressed concern that because of their actions the reconciliation project is now " dead . 
" On the moderate front , [PER al-Hashemi  ] said that during his recent trip to [LOC Sulaymaniyah  ] with President [PER Talabani  ] he had agreed to change [ORG IIP  ] 's conditions ( reftel ) to a program for the coalition to address . 
However , the [ORG VP  ] warned , the [ORG PM  ] has been unable to convince [PER Dawa  ] to support the coalition . 
The Ambassador and [ORG VP  ] discussed how to address the issue of [ORG GOI  ] officials with close ties to foreign countries , such as [LOC Iran  ] , with the [ORG VP  ] recommending that the [ORG GOI  ] " start from scratch " and hold new elections . 
End Summary. --------------------------------------------- ------- The [ORG Baghdad Security Plan: Al-Hashemi Offers Support  ] --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The Ambassador outlined the chief components of the new [ORG Baghdad Security Plan  ] and called on the [ORG VP  ] to support the [ORG PM  ] and this plan . 
First , [ORG Coalition Forces  ] ( [ORG CF  ] ) and [ORG Iraqi Security Forces  ] ( [ORG ISF  ] ) will pursue anyone who breaks the law . 
There will be no sanctuary anywhere in greater [LOC Baghdad  ] , the Ambassador emphasized . 
Second , [LOC Baghdad  ] will be divided into nine districts overseen by two deputy commanders reporting directly to a military commander with full authority operating independently of political pressures . 
Finally , the security plan will be accompanied by economic and services plan . 
In order to secure [LOC Baghdad  ] , the Ambassador said , the [ORG Iraqi Army  ] ( [LOC IA  ] ) will bring three extra brigades to [LOC Baghdad  ] , two from northern [LOC Iraq  ] and one from the [LOC South  ] , working alongside an extra [LOC US  ] brigade . 
The coalition will support by bringing more forces into [LOC Iraq  ] and committing additional forces to be brought in if needed . 
The details will be worked out in the coming days. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG VP  ] responded that [ORG National Security Advisor Muwafuq Rubai'e  ] had already presented the plan to him . 
" I gave him four pages of comments , " the [ORG VP  ] said , and also " sent a copy to General [PER Casey  ] . 
" He reiterated previous concerns about [MISC Shia-Sunni  ] balance within the [ORG ISF  ] , especially at checkpoints . 
The Deputy Commander in [LOC Karkh  ] should be from the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] , al-Hashemi stated , and the Deputy Commander in [LOC Rasafa  ] should be from [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] . 
The [ORG VP  ] agreed that more forces , both [ORG Coalition and Iraqi  ] , would be needed to solve [LOC Baghdad  ] 's security crisis. --------------------------------------------- -------------- Cabinet Reshuffle: Minister of [ORG Defense Needs  ] to Be Replaced --------------------------------------------- -------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The Ambassador asked about the proposed cabinet change , noting that the [ORG PM  ] said [ORG Tawafuq  ] wants to change three ministries but has not provided any substitutions . 
The [ORG VP  ] scoffed , saying that the [ORG PM  ] wants those changes , not [ORG Tawafuq  ] . 
The [ORG PM  ] will not tell us who he wants changed , al-Hashemi complained , and is choosing to form a committee to review the issue . 
One of the changes the [ORG PM  ] wants to make , he continued , is to move [ORG Tawafuq  ] 's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs , [PER Rafi'a  ] al-Issawi , to Minister of Health ( [ORG MoH  ] ) . 
The Ambassador noted that this is a great opportunity for [ORG Tawafuq  ] , since that ministry has been " destroyed " by its current Sadrist Minister and al-Issawi will be " a hero " for fixing it . 
The [ORG VP  ] commented that there are " too many guns and killers " at the [ORG MoH  ] and that key people need to be removed or else al-Issawi " will be killed " by the [MISC Jaysh  ] al-Mahdi ( JAM ) and [PER Moqtada al-Sadr  ] supporters working there. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [ORG VP  ] noted that before [ORG Tawafuq  ] agrees to any ministerial changes , Minister of [ORG Defense  ] [PER Abdul Qadir  ] al-Mufriji must be replaced . 
[ORG Tawafuq  ] has sent a clear [LOC BAGHDAD  ] 00000063 002 OF 003 message to al-Mufirji , al-Hashemi said , that he should resign . 
" We were forced by the [PER Shia  ] coalition " to place an independent [MISC Sunni  ] in this position , the [ORG VP  ] lamented . 
However , al-Hashemi said , the [ORG PM  ] is the boss , the [MISC Commander-in-Chief  ] , and he is not independent . 
The Minister of [ORG Defense  ] makes sectarian issues worse by " simply implementing the [ORG PM  ] 's ideas , " al-Hashemi stressed . 
His replacement , therefore , should come from [ORG Tawafuq  ] . 
The Ambassador noted that the [ORG PM  ] has not decided the extent of his cabinet change and that the Minister of [ORG Defense  ] might not be replaced . 
Besides , the Ambassador noted , our military colleagues say al-Mufriji has a good reputation as an honest and non-sectarian minister. --------------------------------------------- ------ [PER Saddam  ] 's [ORG Execution: Reconciliation  ] " Dead " [MISC VP Warns  ] --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Turning to [PER Saddam  ] 's execution , the [ORG VP  ] stated that nobody had consulted with President [PER Talabani  ] , although he noted that he had sent [ORG Rubaie  ] a letter prior to the execution . 
[PER Al-Hashemi  ] commented that [PER Talabani  ] believed his signature was not required because of a legal statute which states high tribunal sentences cannot be changed . 
The Ambassador noted he had been told the same thing , and that he had recommended that the [ORG PM  ] press the Chief Justice for a written opinion concurring with this assessment . 
[PER Al-Hashemi  ] said he had also suggested that a judge put in writing his opinion that a Presidential decree was unnecessary. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The Ambassador then asked the [ORG VP  ] whether the [ORG PM  ] or his advisors had approached him before the execution . 
The [ORG VP  ] said that he had not been consulted , although prior to the execution he sent a letter to both the [ORG PM  ] and [PER Rubai'e  ] sharing concerns raised by [LOC Salah  ] ad [LOC Din  ] ( [LOC SaD  ] ) officials during a December 28 meeting ( Ref A ) . 
The letter , the [ORG VP  ] continued , requested three days notice to address security issues in [LOC SaD  ] , [PER Saddam  ] 's home province , and recommended that the [ORG GOI  ] release [PER Saddam  ] 's remains to the [LOC SaD Governor  ] for burial . 
According to the [ORG VP  ] , [PER Rubai'e  ] responded that it would not be possible to provide three days notice since the [ORG PM  ] is keeping all details " a secret until the last minute . 
" [PER Rubai'e  ] further stated , al-Hashemi said , that he would try to give notice at least one hour before the event. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In addition to the legal issues and returning [PER Saddam  ] 's remains to [LOC SaD  ] , the [ORG VP  ] said he also spoke to the [ORG PM  ] about rushing through the execution during [ORG Eid  ] . 
According to al-Hashemi , the [ORG PM  ] responded that it was " your [ORG Eid  ] , not mine , " and noted that the religious leaders had confirmed that if [PER Saddam  ] was executed before sunrise it would not occur during [ORG Eid  ] . 
( Note: [PER Saddam  ] was executed approximately one hour before sunrise on December 30 , the day which [PER Sunni Muslims  ] began celebrating [ORG Eid  ] al-Adha . 
End Note ) . 
The [ORG VP  ] noted that [PER Saddam  ] was executed " as a [PER Sunni  ] , not as a dictator , " and called the execution " the revenge of the [ORG Dawa  ] party . 
" He further commented that reconciliation " was dead " because of how the execution occurred. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The Ambassador agreed that many people are upset with how the execution occurred . 
When asked why the [ORG USG  ] had released [PER Saddam Hussein  ] when the [ORG GOI  ] had not resolved some of these issues , the Ambassador responded that [LOC Iraq  ] had legal custody of [PER Saddam  ] , although at [ORG GOI  ] 's request we had physical custody . 
" We voiced our concerns , " the Ambassador said , but in the end the [ORG PM  ] made the final decision . 
Based on [PER Saddam  ] 's execution , the [ORG VP  ] suggested that [MISC MNF-I  ] encourage the [ORG PM  ] to postpone the remaining two executions until reconciliation has concluded. --------------------------------------------- ---------------- Moderate Front: [ORG IIP  ] Relents on Conditions ; [ORG Dawa  ] will not join --------------------------------------------- ---------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The Ambassador noted that efforts to form a moderate front have stalled and asked the [ORG VP  ] where [ORG IIP  ] stands on their list of demands which must be met before joining the coalition . 
The [ORG VP  ] replied that while visiting [LOC Sulaymaniyah  ] with President [PER Talabani  ] , [ORG IIP  ] agreed to change their conditions ( Ref B ) to an agenda the moderate front would address . 
In fact , al-Hashemi said , [ORG IIP  ] had issued an amended statement to this effect and had passed it to [PER Rowsch Shaways  ] ( former [MISC Iraqi  ] Vice President and Deputy Prime Minister ) [MISC Kurd  ] ) [ORG KDP  ] ) and current Vice President [PER Adil Abdul Mehdi  ] ( [ORG SCIRI  ] ) . 
They took the amended statement to the [ORG PM  ] , al-Hashemi said . 
The problem , the [ORG VP  ] continued , is that the [ORG PM  ] has been unable to convince [ORG Dawa  ] to join the coalition . 
According to the [ORG VP  ] , the [ORG PM  ] has said that as a political party leader he cannot join the coalition , but as the [ORG PM  ] he could form a group with the [ORG Presidency Council  ] ( the President [LOC BAGHDAD  ] 00000063 003 OF 003 and two VPs ) and the [ORG Council of Representatives  ] ( [ORG CoR  ] ) speaker , [PER Mahmoud Mashadani  ] . 
The Ambassador responded that it would be better if the coalition formed around political bloc leaders . 
There could be constitutional concerns if a new alliance between official positions forms , the Ambassador cautioned . 
The [ORG VP  ] said that once [PER Abdul Mehdi  ] returns to [LOC Baghdad  ] he is willing to discuss the issue again. --------------------------------------------- ------------- On [MISC Iranian  ] Influence in the GOI: [ORG VP  ] suggests new elections --------------------------------------------- ------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) On the [MISC Iranian  ] detainees , the Ambassador commented that President [PER Talabani  ] called these people his " guests , " but he did not even know who they are , the Ambassador said . 
The [ORG VP  ] responded that [LOC Iran  ] 's activities within [LOC Iraq  ] and their connections to [ORG GOI  ] officials have not been a secret . 
" I have been warning about [LOC Iran  ] 's influence for some time , " he said . 
The [ORG VP  ] offered his appreciation for General [PER Caldwell  ] 's presentation ( Ref C ) , but noted the General only shared " things I already knew . 
" The Ambassador asked the [ORG VP  ] what should be done with [ORG GOI  ] leaders who are working with [ORG Quds Force  ] operatives . 
The [ORG VP  ] replied that the [ORG GOI  ] needs " to start from scratch , " with new elections and needs to strengthen a weak central government . 
While affirming his commitment to democracy and rule of law , the [ORG VP  ] noted that there are " problems " with some of the political partners . 
The [ORG VP  ] further commented that [LOC Iran  ] 's reach extends beyond [ORG SCIRI  ] , [PER Badr  ] and the [MISC Sadrists  ] . 
He explained his belief that [ORG CoR  ] Speaker [PER Mahmoud Mashadani  ] ( [ORG Tawafuq  ] ) is also influenced by the [MISC Iranians  ] and noted that several [PER Sunni  ] insurgent and resistance groups have received [MISC Iranian  ] support. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Al-Hashemi  ] asked the Ambassador about the [ORG GOI  ] 's actions once [MISC MNF-I  ] released the detainees . 
The Ambassador commented that while he shares concerns about [MISC Iranian  ] influence , the [ORG GOI  ] took some positive steps during this incident . 
First , he said , once [MISC MNF-I  ] released the detainees , the [ORG GOI  ] ordered them to leave [LOC Iraq  ] and escorted them to the [MISC Iranian  ] border . 
Second , the [ORG MFA  ] issued a statement announcing their departure and stated publicly that " their activities had been inconsistent with their diplomatic status . 
" Third , the [ORG GOI  ] has requested an updated list of [MISC Iranian  ] diplomats in [LOC Iraq  ] so that in the future it will be easier to verify diplomatic status . 
Finally , the [ORG GOI  ] is sending a delegation to [LOC Iran  ] , most likely led by Deputy Prime Minister [PER Barham Salih  ] , to discuss the incident and its implications . 
The Ambassador asked why the [ORG VP  ] and [ORG IIP  ] have not made a bigger deal about the issue . 
The [ORG VP  ] responded that [ORG IIP  ] is more concerned about reconciliation and that he fears making a big deal about the [MISC Iranians  ] and their ties with other [ORG GOI  ] leaders will hinder the reconciliation effort .
