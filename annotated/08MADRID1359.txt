MADRID 1257 <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
MADRID 1226 Classified By: DCM Arnold [PER A. Chacon  ] , for Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Presidency Secretary-General [PER Bernardino Leon  ] confirmed in a December 22 dinner with the Ambassador that President [PER Zapatero  ] has tasked him with ensuring that [MISC Russian  ] ( and partly [MISC U.S.-owned  ] ) oil company [ORG Lukoil  ] 's pending purchase of a sizable stake in [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG Repsol  ] takes place on politically acceptable terms . 
[PER Leon  ] is seeking to limit [ORG Lukoil  ] to purchasing the 20 percent stake of [ORG Repsol  ] owned by troubled construction company [ORG Sacyr Vallehermoso  ] , rather than the almost 30 percent it had originally sought ( reftels ) , so that [ORG Lukoil  ] will not become [ORG Repsol  ] 's most influential shareholder . 
[PER Zapatero  ] wants to see the sale of [ORG Sacyr  ] 's stake go through in order to help [ORG Sacyr  ] , which has more than 20,000 employees , overcome its current difficulties . 
King [PER Juan Carlos  ] also has been a proponent of the deal , which is seen as a way of strengthening [MISC Spain'  ] s relations with [LOC Russia  ] . 
[PER Leon  ] is seeking either to persuade [ORG Repsol  ] 's other [MISC Spanish  ] shareholders to hold their shares or to find [MISC Spanish  ] buyers for them . 
At present , the main hurdle to the [MISC Sacyr-Lukoil  ] deal appears to be price , especially with the continuing fall in the price of oil . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] banks who are [ORG Sacyr  ] 's creditors would finance [ORG Lukoil  ] 's purchase , as they are reported to prefer to be creditors of [ORG Lukoil  ] than of [ORG Sacyr  ] if acceptable collateral arrangements can be reached. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Comment: His involvement in the sensitive [ORG Lukoil  ] deal plays up [PER Leon  ] 's increasing importance as one of [PER Zapatero  ] 's closest advisers , especially on international issues ( along with Defense Minister [PER Chacon  ] ) . 
The forty-four year-old former deputy foreign minister plays a more policy-oriented role than the coordinating function that usually falls to the presidency secretary-general . 
He also accompanies [PER Zapatero  ] on all his foreign travel . 
[PER Leon  ] was supposed to accompany [PER Zapatero  ] to [LOC Afghanistan  ] December 23 , but the trip was cancelled because of regional government financing discussions , in which he is the government 's point man . 
[PER Leon  ] told the Ambassador he expects to join [PER Zapatero  ] on a trip to [LOC Lebanon  ] early in the [MISC New Year.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Comment Continued: [PER Leon  ] does not seek a prominent public role , and he told the Ambassador that a December 22 article in the [ORG El Mundo  ] newspaper playing up his super-charged [ORG National Security Advisor  ] role did not go over well with with Foreign Minister [PER Moratinos  ] and Second Vice President and Finance/Treasury Minister [PER Solbes  ] . 
The article described [PER Leon  ] as the brain behind the effort to increase [LOC Spain  ] 's international influence , particularly with the [LOC U.S.  ] , and it included several statements that could be read as slights to [PER Moratinos  ] , such as " some say he ( [PER Leon  ] ) is the real foreign minister and has more influence than the Vice President . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Comment Continued: [PER Leon  ] clearly will be one of the key voices shaping [PER Zapatero  ] 's views on the next [LOC U.S.  ] administration , and he appears to have a better understanding of the [LOC U.S.  ] than either [PER Zapatero  ] or other advisers . 
[PER Leon  ] visited the [LOC U.S.  ] in April to meet with advisers to then-candidates [PER Obama  ] , [PER Clinton  ] , and [PER McCain  ] . 
He is reported to have organized [PER Zapatero  ] 's September [MISC New York  ] meeting with [LOC U.S.  ] business leaders ( working through the [MISC AmCham  ] ) , and he directed the ultimately successful campaign to get [LOC Spain  ] invited to the November G-20 financial crisis summit . 
He said he looked forward to meeting with [ORG WHA A/S Shannon  ] during the latter 's visit in early January . 
We will seek to maintain our strong relationship with him over the coming months .
