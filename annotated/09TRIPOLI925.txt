REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: Dr. [PER Mahamud Ahmed Al-Ftise  ] , head of the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Privatization and Investment Authority  ] , told Econoff November 10 that [LOC Libya  ] 's efforts to privatize its state-owned enterprises ( [MISC SOEs  ] ) are progressing and that 24 companies have been privatized in 2009 , resulting in a total of 110 companies privatized in [LOC Libya  ] since the process began four years ago . 
The [ORG Authority  ] has also established a " one-stop shop " facility for foreign investors , designed to ease access to government offices ranging from visas to customs . 
[PER Al-Ftise  ] requested [LOC U.S.  ] assistance in providing training to the [ORG Authority  ] 's [ORG Training Department  ] , as well as to the newly privatized [MISC Libyan  ] companies . 
He also invited [LOC U.S.  ] firms to bid on any of the companies undergoing privatization . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) During a November 10 meeting , Dr. [PER Mahamud Ahmed Al-Ftise  ] , Secretary of the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Privatization and Investment Authority  ] , reported that [LOC Libya  ] 's efforts to privatize its state-owned enterprises ( [MISC SOEs  ] ) were moving forward , with 24 companies privatized this year . 
He said that in total , the [ORG Authority  ] had worked to privatize 110 companies since the process began about four years ago . 
[PER Al-Ftise  ] noted that the [ORG Authority  ] 's future plans included privatization of oil service companies , which currently make up 49 percent of the companies own by the [ORG National Oil Company  ] ( [ORG NOC  ] ) . 
Additionally , 25 industrial plants are slated to be privatized in the next few years , including a steel mill . 
As an example of how the privatization process functions in [LOC Libya  ] , he explained that ten-percent of the shares of the steel mill would be offered on the [MISC Libyan  ] [LOC Stock Market  ] , and over the long-run , the mill would be completely privatized . 
He characterized the entire privatization process as completely " transparent . 
" [ Note: This contradicts information we have received during separate meetings on the privatization process , as reported reftel . 
End note . 
] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) When asked whether foreign companies had purchased any of the newly-privatized [MISC Libyan  ] firms , [PER Al-Ftise  ] said that foreign firms had not expressed much interest in the " old factories . 
" He explained that the [ORG Authority  ] encourages buyers to purchase not only the assets of formerly state-run companies but also to keep existing employees on the payroll . 
[ Comment: This is often an unattractive prospect for foreign investors , as [LOC Libya  ] 's state-owned companies are infamous for low productivity and over-staffing due to [LOC Libya  ] 's generous labor laws . 
End comment . 
] In what he termed as a " trade-off , " he explained that the [ORG Authority  ] would charge a lower price if the buyer accepted a company with its current employees. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) According to [PER Al-Ftise  ] , the [ORG Privatization and Investment Authority  ] does not widely advertise which companies will be available for purchase , but rather , it has adopted a more targeted approach towards possible buyers , both [MISC Libyan  ] and foreign . 
He said [LOC U.S.  ] investors would be welcome to bid on any of the available companies and he cited a chemical plant as a potentially interesting property xxxxxxxxxxxx . 
He noted this chemical plant would need to transition away from using mercury in its production , and an [MISC American  ] firm might have expertise in this particular area . 
[ Comment: Econoff has visited the area near the factory and [MISC Libyans  ] living nearby have reported wildlife with genetic abnormalities , even showing photographs of two-headed fish . 
It is doubtful an [MISC American  ] firm would want to take on liabilities associated with using mercury . 
End comment . 
] ONE-STOP SHOP OFFERS GOVERNMENT SERVICES: GREAT IDEA BUT IS ANYONE HOME ? <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The staff of the [ORG Privatization and Investment Authority  ] took Emboffs on a tour of the new " one-stop shop " for investors seeking information and help in entering the [MISC Libyan  ] market . 
The " shop " features desks for representatives of the various government offices that investors need to contact in order to do business in [LOC Libya  ] , such as tax , electricity , industrial zones , manpower ( labor ) , customs , and immigration ( covering visas ) . 
During our visit , however , only one desk was occupied ( immigration ) . 
[LOC U.S.  ] TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WOULD BE WELCOME <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) According to [PER Al-Ftise  ] , the newly-privatized companies may have training needs that the [LOC U.S.  ] can help with , including [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000925 002.2 OF 002 training for their boards of directors on their roles and responsibilities , as well as the need for technical assistance in areas such as marketing , quality assurance , and operational management . 
[PER Al-Ftise  ] further requested that the [LOC U.S.  ] provide [MISC Arabic  ] speaking consultants to provide training and technical assistance to the [ORG Authority  ] 's [ORG ten-person Training Department  ] . 
BIO NOTE <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Al-Ftise  ] received a scholarship from the [MISC Libyan  ] Government to study in the [LOC U.S.  ] and earned his [MISC BSc  ] in Industrial Engineering from the [ORG University of Toledo  ] ( [LOC Ohio  ] ) in 1981 . 
He then went to [LOC Hungary  ] , where he received his PhD in [ORG Project Management  ] in 1996 . 
Between his return from [ORG Toledo  ] in 1981 and taking up his PhD studies in [LOC Hungary  ] in 1996 , he worked for the General People 's [ORG Committee for Industry and Minerals  ] . 
[PER Al-Ftise  ] is married with five children and has several grandchildren . 
While in the [LOC United States  ] , he and his wife had a daughter , who is a [LOC US  ] citizen . 
She is a dentist and lives in [LOC Libya  ] . 
He speaks [MISC English  ] fluently and speaks ( but does not read ) [MISC Hungarian  ] . 
COMMENT <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The [ORG Privatization Authority  ] appears to be making progress , in terms of transferring 110 state-owned enterprises to private ownership . 
The [ORG Authority  ] now has new offices in downtown [LOC Tripoli  ] ( as opposed to shabby offices in a former factory in the suburbs ) complete with its " one-stop shop " to facilitate foreign investor access to government services . 
As reported in reftel , however , the privatization process is not readily transparent , and many of the companies are reportedly not being awarded on a competitive basis , with certain beneficiaries appearing to be regime loyalists . 
We will follow-up with [PER Al-Ftise  ] on his requests for training and technical assistance .
