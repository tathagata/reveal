MADRID 567 Classified By: Acting Deputy Chief of Mission [PER Josie Shumake  ] , for reason s 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) The information in this message is keyed to questions posed in reftel A , paragraph 5 and updates information reported in reftel B. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Has the host country , in Post 's opinion , worked to promote the advancement of democracy and human rights in [LOC Cuba  ] ? 
[LOC Spain  ] hosted a highly publicized [ORG Human Rights Dialogue Mechanism  ] with [LOC Cuba  ] on February 11 . 
[ORG MFA Political Director  ] [PER Rafael Dezcallar  ] told us the [ORG GOS  ] had presented a list of 20-30 prisoners of conscience , including [PER Oscar Biscet  ] , to the [MISC Cuban  ] Government . 
Though no public linkage was made , [LOC Cuba  ] subsequently released four political prisoners and allowed them to travel to [LOC Spain  ] , where they arrived February 17 , in search of medical treatment . 
[MISC Spanish  ] Secretary of State for [MISC Latin American  ] Affairs [PER Trinidad Jimenez  ] personally assured the new February arrivals and their families the support of her government . 
The [ORG GOS  ] is currently considering the application of one prisoner , [PER Jose Gabriel Ramon Castillo  ] , for political asylum in [LOC Spain  ] . 
The other three dissidents , [PER Alejandro Gonzalez Raga  ] , [PER Pedro Pablo Alvarez  ] and [PER Omar Pernet  ] accepted the residency permit offered by [MISC Spanish  ] authorities . 
[PER Pedro Pablo Alvarez Ramos  ] was authorized [MISC Spanish  ] residency May 9 , and the [ORG MFA  ] is working with the [MISC Spanish  ] consulate in [LOC Miami  ] to bring five of his family members to [LOC Spain  ] , where they reportedly have offers of employment in [LOC Barcelona.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In the wake of the human rights talks , [MISC Spanish  ] officials have suggested changes on the island were attributable in part to the renewed dialogue . 
The [ORG GOS  ] has subsequently attempted to convince [ORG EU  ] partners , including during the May 16 EU-Latin [MISC American  ] [ORG Summit  ] in [LOC Lima  ] , that the [MISC Spanish-Cuban  ] dialogue has achieved results that merit lifting the ( currently suspended ) restrictive measures imposed by the [ORG EU  ] against [LOC Cuba  ] in 2003 . 
[MISC Spanish  ] officials told [ORG Cuba Transition  ] Coordinator [PER Caleb McCarry  ] in April that [LOC Spain  ] was reluctant to put too much pressure on the government of [PER Raul Castro  ] , and said [LOC Spain  ] viewed modifications announced by [LOC Cuba  ] as openings to democratic change . 
A [MISC Spanish  ] diplomat reiterated to [MISC Cuban  ] dissidents gathered at the Deputy Chief of Mission 's residence May 21 ( ref C ) the [ORG GOS  ] view that [LOC Cuba  ] has improved significantly since 2003 , hinting at the position [LOC Spain  ] is expected to take at June [ORG EU  ] discussions to review the common position . 
COMMENT: Post and [PER CTC McCarry  ] have stressed to the [MISC Spanish  ] that the elimination of the common position could legitimize [PER Raul  ] , s rule . 
The [ORG EU  ] could use the overall debate , with [LOC Spain  ] , s leadership , to press [LOC Cuba  ] to take new action on human rights . 
Though we are skeptical of what an [MISC EU-GOC  ] human rights dialogue would achieve if they do drop the measures , the [MISC Spanish  ] claim it would achieve new movement from the [MISC Cubans  ] . 
END COMMENT. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Has the host country made other public statements or undertaken other governmental actions . . . or actions in support of civil society in [LOC Cuba  ] through host country 's diplomatic missions or other fora ? 
The [MISC Spanish  ] Government has viewed the February transfer of powers from [PER Fidel  ] to [PER Raul Castro  ] as generally positive . 
Nonetheless , then-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs [PER Bernardino Leon  ] stated February 27 that the [ORG GOS  ] " does not defend a transition within the current [MISC Cuban  ] regime . 
" Also in February , [LOC Spain  ] denied on technical grounds the asylum request of a [MISC Cuban  ] diplomat defector , [PER Lorenzo Menndez  ] , who arrived in [LOC Spain  ] from [LOC France  ] in December 2007 . 
[MISC Spanish  ] officials and former President [PER Aznar  ] met in early March with [PER Elsa Morejon  ] , the wife of [ORG Presidential Medal of Freedom  ] winner [PER Oscar Biscet  ] . 
Media reported in association with the March 19 commemoration of [LOC Cuba  ] 's [ORG Black Spring  ] that [MISC Spanish  ] President [PER Zapatero  ] had sent a letter ( dated January 28 ) to [PER Laura Pollan  ] ( wife of [PER Hector Maseda  ] ) saying [LOC Spain  ] would continue to do all it could to win the freedom of political prisoners . 
[PER Zapatero  ] also expressed admiration for the work of the [PER Damas  ] en [PER Blanco  ] and recognized their " dignity and courage . 
" The [PER Damas  ] who led the annual march from the gates of [LOC Madrid  ] , s [ORG Royal Palace  ] to a commemorative mass in the adjacent Cathedral of the [PER Almudena  ] on March 18 read aloud President [PER Zapatero  ] , s letter along with President [PER Bush  ] , s statement. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Foreign Minister [PER Moratinos  ] , who visited [LOC Havana  ] in April 2007 , included [LOC Cuba  ] as part of [LOC Spain  ] 's foreign policy agenda for the current [ORG Congress  ] when he appeared May 22 before the body 's Foreign Affairs [ORG Commission  ] . 
In seeking consensus with opposition parties on the agenda for debate , [PER Moratinos  ] spoke in support of an open process of reform on the island through " mutual respect " and " constructive dialogue . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Have there been any high-level diplomatic visits between [LOC Cuba  ] and the host country in the past six months ? 
There have been no high-level visits with the exception of the aforementioned human rights talks . 
[PER Ricardo Guerrero Blanco  ] , [MISC Cuban  ] Vice Minister for Foreign Investment , met the week of May 12 with [LOC Canary Islands  ] businessmen who attended a meeting in [LOC Santa Cruz de Tenerife  ] to explore investment opportunities in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
[PER Guerrero  ] said the [MISC Cuban  ] Government viewed [MISC Canaries  ] investment positively and offered [MISC Spanish  ] businessmen the opportunity to invest in hotel projects in the regions of [LOC Camaguey  ] and [ORG Ciego de Avila  ] , as well as to build golf courses and other leisure facilities , according to press reports. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) What is the nature of investments ( and names , if known ) that host country businesses have in [LOC Cuba  ] ? 
Information on [MISC Spanish  ] foreign investment in [LOC Cuba  ] is limited , in part because [MISC Spanish  ] companies avoid publishing such data . 
[LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG Ministry of Economy and Finance  ] reports that during the 1995-2007 period , [MISC Spanish  ] investment in [LOC Cuba  ] amounted to roughly euros 4.7 billion ( 6 billion dollars ) . 
The ministry reports that in 2007 , [MISC Spanish  ] companies invested euros 4 million . 
The biggest [MISC Spanish  ] investments are in the tobacco and tourism sectors . 
Nine of the twelve foreign companies that invest in the tourism sector in [LOC Cuba  ] are [MISC Spanish  ] . 
There follow below names of [MISC Spanish  ] companies active in [LOC Cuba  ] listed by sector: [ORG Tourism: Globalia Hoteles  ] , [PER Sol Melia  ] , [ORG NH Hoteles  ] , [PER Marsans  ] , [ORG Iberostar Group  ] , [PER Barcelo  ] , [ORG Occidental  ] , and [ORG RIU  ] . 
Financial Sector: [ORG BBVA  ] , [ORG Banco Sabadell  ] , [ORG Caja de Ahorros  ] del [MISC Mediterraneo  ] , and [ORG Caja Madrid  ] . 
( These institutions have small representative offices that presumably do mostly trade finance . 
) Energy and other utilities: [ORG Repsol  ] YPF , [ORG Aguas de Barcelona  ] , [ORG Endesa  ] , and [ORG Iberdrola Tobacco: Altadis Airlines: Iberia Dairy: Penasanta  ] , S.A. Note: In terms of actual money invested , the overwhelming majority comes from the tourism companies and the tobacco firm , [ORG Altadis  ] . 
[ORG Repsol  ] does some exploration work in [LOC Cuba  ] , and the other companies mentioned have representative offices . 
On May 18 , 2008 , left-of-center daily [ORG El Pais  ] reported that the [ORG Securities and Exchange Commission  ] ( [ORG SEC  ] ) had sent [ORG Repsol  ] a letter asking the company about its investments in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
[ORG Repsol  ] reportedly responded that since 2000 , it has had permission to drill for oil in seven blocks situated in [MISC Cuban  ] waters , but that so far , it had not found any oil. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) In April , the government of [LOC Cuba  ] reportedly approached [LOC Spain  ] about the possibility of restructuring the repayment of its debt , if the [ORG GOS  ] would reinstitute export credits to [MISC Spanish  ] companies to invest in sectors of the [MISC Cuban  ] economy such as real estate development , road construction , and port modernization . 
[LOC Cuba  ] 's debt to [LOC Spain  ] totals 460 million euros , plus an additional 400 millions euros being negotiated in the [ORG Paris Club  ] and a final 300 million euros of interest , according to the media. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Are there any bilateral trade agreements between host country and [LOC Cuba  ] ? 
Although not necessarily strictly " trade " treaties , the following agreements may be of interest: Agreement between the [LOC Kingdom of  ] [LOC Spain  ] and the [LOC Republic of Cuba  ] on Air Transportation , signed in [LOC Havana  ] , April 22 , 2005 . 
See [LOC Boletin Oficial de Espana  ] ( [PER BOE  ] - [LOC Spain  ] 's equivalent of the [ORG Federal Register  ] ) , 06/09/2006 - [ORG Section  ] 1 . 
Agreement between the [LOC Kingdom of  ] [LOC Spain  ] and the [LOC Republic of Cuba  ] on [ORG Mutual Customs Assistance  ] , signed in [LOC Havana  ] , August 8 , 2001 . 
See [PER BOE  ] 17/03/2003 - [ORG Section  ] 1 . 
Agreement between the [LOC Kingdom of Spain  ] and the [LOC Republic of  ] [LOC Cuba  ] on the [ORG Promotion and Protection of Investment  ] , signed in [LOC Havana  ] on May 27 , 1994 . 
See [PER BOE  ] 06/10/2000 - [ORG Section  ] 1 . 
Complementary Agreement on Tourism , signed in [LOC Havana  ] on September 10 , 1978 . 
See [PER BOE  ] 02/03/1987 - [ORG Section  ] 1 . 
Agreement between the [LOC Republic of  ] [LOC Cuba  ] and the [LOC Kingdom of Spain  ] , signed in [LOC Madrid  ] on October 3 , 1985 . 
See [PER BOE  ] 13/02/1986 . 
Note: [LOC Spain  ] exported euros 668 million worth of goods and services to [LOC Cuba  ] in 2007 , up from euros 629 million in 2006 . 
[LOC Spain  ] imported good and services from [LOC Cuba  ] worth euros 143 million in 2007 , only about three million more than in 2006 . 
[LOC Spain  ] exports mostly mechanical and electrical equipment , appliances , hotel equipment , construction equipment , automotive spare parts , chemicals and foodstuffs . 
[LOC Spain  ] imports mostly tobacco , liquor and fresh fish from [LOC Cuba  ] . 
The strong [MISC Spanish  ] export performance in [LOC Cuba  ] is somewhat surprising as [LOC Spain  ] 's official export credit agency ( [ORG CESCE  ] ) does not guarantee export credits to [LOC Cuba  ] . 
During 2007 , there were discussions about resuming export credit guarantees , but that would first require a debt agreement between [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] . 
Thus far , Post is not aware such an agreement has been reached . 
However , on September 29 , 2007 the [MISC Spanish  ] government did announce it would resume foreign assistance to [LOC Cuba  ] . 
There is an active [ORG Hispano-Cuban Business Committee  ] that promotes trade between the two countries. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Are there any exchange programs between host country and [LOC Cuba  ] ? 
Post is not aware of any such exchange programs .
