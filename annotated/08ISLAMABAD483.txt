End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Ambassador and Polcouns met former Prime Minister and [ORG Pakistan Muslim League-N PML-N  ] ) leader [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] January 31 for an hour during [ORG Nawaz’s  ] recent visit to [LOC Islamabad  ] . 
[ORG PML-N  ] leader [PER Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan  ] also attended the meeting . 
[PER Nawaz  ] met with [ORG EU  ] ambassadors the same day and urged them to take preemptive action to prevent rigging in the upcoming election. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Ambassador noted the reports about threats to [ORG Nawaz’s  ] security and said we were pleased to have briefed his staff on measures that could be taken to enhance his safety . 
[PER Nawaz  ] responded that the [ORG GOP  ] has said he is “number one on the hit list” of the militants , but he is not convinced . 
Citing the belief that an IED planted on the road he was to travel to a rally in [LOC Peshawar  ] lacked a detonator , [PER Nawaz  ] insisted he had received information from credible sources that the device was planted by security services to go off hours after the rally . 
This was another attempt at government intimidation to convince him not to campaign . 
Ambassador cautioned him to remain vigilant as it was clear that militant extremists wanted to disrupt the election . 
[MISC PML-N/PPP:  ] “the best thing that could happen” -------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In response to [MISC Ambassador’s  ] question about whether [ORG PML-N  ] could work with the [ORG Pakistan People’s Party  ] ( [ORG PPP  ] ) in a possible coalition government , [PER Nawaz  ] recounted how he had immediately gone to the hospital when he heard [PER Benazir Bhutto  ] had been shot , and he had made a special effort to pay a condolence call on [PER Asif Zardari  ] in [LOC Larcana  ] . 
Ambassador said that [PER Zardari  ] had noted his appreciation for this gesture of support . 
A PML-N/PPP alliance would be “the best thing that could happen to [LOC Pakistan  ] , ” if it materialized , said [PER Nawaz  ] . 
The [ORG PML-N  ] had reached out to the [ORG PPP  ] , and time would tell what alliances could be built . 
They could also work together in the provincial government of [LOC Sindh  ] or [LOC Punjab  ] . 
He predicted that the [ORG PPP  ] could win enough seats to rule in [LOC Sindh  ] with or without the [ORG Muttahida Quami Movement  ] ( [ORG MQM  ] ) . <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Nawaz  ] expected both [ORG PPP  ] and [ORG PML-N  ] would do well at the polls if the elections were free and fair ; he dismissed the [ORG Pakistan Muslim League  ] party , saying that [PER Pervaiz Elahi  ] would get few , if any votes . 
Claiming he had no vendetta against President [PER Musharraf  ] , [PER Nawaz  ] said the [ORG PML-N  ] had also reached out to the [ORG Pakistan Muslim League  ] and they in turn had contacted [ORG PML-N  ] ( Ref A ) . 
( Note: He then launched into a long description of his mistreatment after [PER Musharraf  ] overthrew [PER Nawaz  ] in 1999 ) . 
The [MISC PML-N’s  ] goal in government would be to reinstate the deposed judiciary and restore the law and order situation . 
Without restoring the judiciary , [PER Nawaz  ] argued , you cannot restore law and order and rule of law. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Ambassador said we continued to support an independent judiciary and wanted to work with the new government on this issue . 
It was simply too difficult to tackle before elections . 
We believed there should be a way to restore some of the deposed judges , but not the former Chief Justice . 
[PER Nawaz  ] insisted that without restoring the Chief Justice , there was no point to filling other slots on the bench . 
Ambassador disagreed , noting that many of the provincial judges could be restored for the benefit of Pakistan’s judiciary . 
[LOC ISLAMABAD  ] 00000483 002 OF 002 Emotions High ------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Despite the decreased level of campaigning due to security concerns , [PER Nawaz  ] and [PER Khan  ] both said that voter emotions were higher than they have ever seen . 
[LOC Sindh  ] , in particular , remains very tense , and could erupt if the election outcome is perceived as being rigged . 
[PER Nawaz  ] noted that civil society and student groups were politicized in ways they have not been before . 
The [ORG PML-N  ] did not want violence , but it might be impossible to control the people if they felt they had been wronged . 
[PER Nawaz  ] expressed concern that extremists could take advantage of and exacerbate tensions . 
He warned that what he described as negatively-preceived [LOC U.S.  ] support for [PER Musharraf  ] could create a backlash of anti-Americanism , if the public perceives that the government rigged the elections. “We could be sitting on a volcano , and the next four-five weeks will be critical for the region and for [MISC Pak-American  ] relations.” <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The best thing [LOC America  ] has done recently , said [PER Nawaz  ] , was arrange to have General [PER Kayani  ] named as Chief of [ORG Army Staff  ] . 
This appointment is helping [ORG Army  ] morale and raising the level of public respect for the [ORG Army  ] . 
Noting that [PER Musharraf  ] met the [LOC UK  ] equivalent to the Chairman of the [ORG Joint Chiefs  ] , [PER Khan  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [LOC UK  ] need to stop treating [PER Musharraf  ] as if he still ran the military . 
CENTCOM Commander Admiral [ORG Fallon  ] would have met with [PER Musharaf  ] if the President had not been travelling , asserted [PER Khan  ] . 
Ambassador replied that we had excellent relations with the [MISC Pakistani  ] military and meet them all the time at various levels . 
We are [MISC Pro-American  ] ------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Nawaz  ] and [PER Khan  ] both repeatedly said that the [ORG PML-N  ] was pro-American . 
[PER Nawaz  ] recounted his decision to override his Chief of [ORG Army Staff  ] and deploy [MISC Pakistani  ] troops to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] in support of the [LOC U.S.  ] coalition in the first [MISC Gulf War  ] . 
Meanwhile , [PER Khan  ] noted , the [ORG PPP  ] and its leaders were organizing street demonstrations against [LOC Pakistan  ] joining with the [LOC U.S.  ] coalition . 
Now , [PER Nawaz  ] said , he was hurt that the [LOC U.S.  ] did not remember . 
[PER Nawaz  ] said he understood that 9/11 had changed things , but urged that the [LOC U.S.  ] apply some balance to the relationship . 
In the past , the [LOC U.S.  ] was known as the power that rejected dictatorships , that fought for independence of the judiciary and the rule of law . 
Why , he asked , did we continue to support a man who fired the [ORG Supreme Court  ] , abrogated the constitution , and arrested civil society activists ? <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Comment: The fact that a former Prime Minister believes the [LOC U.S.  ] could control the appointment of Pakistan’s Chief of [ORG Army Staff  ] speaks volumes about the myth of [MISC American  ] influence here . 
Based on our understanding of the current situation , we believe [PER Nawaz  ] can and should take the threats to his life seriously . 
It comes as no surprise that [PER Nawaz  ] exaggerated his party’s election prospects ; his willingness to deal with the [ORG PPP  ] is , however , a good sign he is ready to cooperate on government formation .
