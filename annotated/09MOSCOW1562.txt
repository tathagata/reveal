[LOC MOSCOW  ] 00180 Classified By: Ambassador [PER John Beyrle  ] . 
Reason: 1.4 ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary . 
The events two weeks ago in the northwestern town of [LOC Pikalevo  ] , in which frustrated workers in three small , idled plants blocked a federal highway to draw attention to their plight , demonstrated the failures of [LOC Russia  ] 's " vertical of power " and gave insight into the balance of power within the elite ( Ref B ) . 
That the impasse required the involvement of Prime Minister [PER Putin  ] -- the man " responsible for everything " in [LOC Russia  ] -- illustrated the weakness of the federal system , in which poorly connected governors have few levers to influence the [MISC Moscow-based  ] financial industrial groups close to the [LOC Kremlin  ] . 
Moreover , none of the institutions designed to protect citizen interests functioned: labor unions , political parties , or even state institutions like the [ORG Federal Anti-Monopoly Service  ] could not bring about a solution ( even after President [PER Medvedev  ] reportedly told the [LOC Leningrad  ] Oblast Governor [PER Serdyukov  ] to fix the problem in March ) . 
Experts are divided on the logic behind [PER Putin  ] 's decision to make a public spectacle out of [LOC Pikalevo  ] , but nearly all see his involvement after an independent demonstration by ordinary citizens as a likely catalyst for more localized protests by other dissatisfied groups , seeking to attract the Prime Minister 's attention in the coming months . 
End Summary . 
The [ORG System Failed  ] ----------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The economic crisis is testing the " [PER Putin  ] system " of administration , established during 8-years of strong economic growth to establish central control over the county and maintain socio-economic stability . 
The points of pressure are found in widely dispersed " one-company towns " across [LOC Russia  ] , where less efficient and less advanced companies , particularly in metallurgy and machine building , are failing . 
As such , the chances of localized protests -- a " bunt " of frustrated workers -- are increasing , potentially creating a crisis of confidence within the tandem. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [LOC Pikalevo  ] situation highlighted the weakness of [LOC Russia  ] 's federal structure . 
After [PER Putin  ] 's reforms , governors serve at [LOC Moscow  ] 's pleasure and are judged less by their effectiveness as leaders or ability to solve local problems than by their resolute support for central authorities ( demonstrated in their management of regional elections to secure the party of power , [ORG United Russia  ] ) and their ability to maintain political and social stability . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , political and tax reforms over the past years have curtailed the governors' influence over the budget and reduced their authority to make decisions without [LOC Moscow  ] 's approval . 
Economic prosperity , fueled by high energy prices , helped to mask the weakening of regional leadership ; the crisis had made it more acute. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The case with [LOC Leningrad  ] Oblast Governor [PER Serdyukov  ] in connection with [LOC Pikalevo  ] illustrates the problem of ineffective regional leadership . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] blamed the [PER Serdyukov  ] 's incompetence and the local mayor 's " unprofessionalism " for allowing the problem to fester . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] had a more positive assessment of [PER Serdyukov  ] , but noted that a " second tier " governor had no ability to tell the well-connected [PER Deripaska  ] what to do – - only the heavyweights had sufficient authority to challenge members of the tandem 's inner circle . 
No matter what the assessment of [PER Serdyukov  ] " the man , " his loyalties remained primarily tied to keeping [LOC Moscow  ] 's favor , leading him to cover over the deteriorating situation in [LOC Pikalevo  ] by emphasizing new investment projects , like the [ORG Nissan  ] factory that [PER Putin  ] opened on June 2. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also has identified a second element that led to [ORG Pikalevo:  ] a crisis of dialogue between the political leadership ( vlast ) and society , in which any attempt to draw attention to serious problems are treated as a threat to the system and the regime . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted the fate of [PER Yuriy Onoprienko  ] , the Speaker of the [ORG Khabarovsk Kray  ] legislature , who was fired by [ORG United Russia  ] after deputies there sent a letter to [PER Putin  ] requesting that tariffs for energy not be increased because of the economic crisis . 
Similarly , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] drew the ire of the pro-Kremlin press and almost faced charges of " extremism " [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
Now , he and others who have criticized the tandem 's anti-crisis package are finding [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00001562 002 OF 003 themselves vindicated , although without any recognition from the authorities . 
The regime has also shown little tolerance for criticism from society ; last December [MISC Moscow-based  ] OMON police forces used force to dispel protests in [LOC Vladivostok  ] against increased tariffs on imported automobiles . 
Deputy Prime Minister [PER Igor Sechin  ] dismissed the protests as the actions of " scoundrels " while [ORG United Russia  ] Duma officials insinuated that the presence of [MISC Japanese  ] flags by the protesters signaled instigation from overseas ( Ref C ) . <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Ultimately , commentators argue the crisis at [LOC Pikalevo  ] resulted from the shortcomings of the tandem 's crisis plan , which emphasizes maintaining employment ( even with substantially reduced salaries ) over accepting the pain of economic restructuring of inefficient and unprofitable enterprises . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us " the factories should be closed " and he admitted that [PER Putin  ] 's solution does not solve the problem of a lack of demand for aluminum -- the catalyst behind the plants' closure . 
Thus far , the administration 's response has been to demand more action on the part of regional and local leaders to follow through with the plans to maintain employment and stop wage arrears. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) After [LOC Pikalevo  ] , the central leadership made no reassessment of its strategy , but instead used the whip to put more pressure on regional leaders to follow through with the " stability " agenda . 
[PER Medvedev  ] on June 10 threatened regional leaders with dismissal if they fail to get wage arrears and unemployment under control -- telling them to " stop hiding under the table " and take charge of negotiating with industries and workers' collectives . 
[LOC Kremlin  ] ideologue [PER Vladislav Surkov  ] told a conference of municipal heads that government at all levels should become " more open " and engaged in dialogue with society . 
However , as [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] explained to us , this anti-crisis policy rests on a fragile social compromise , in which businesses keep workers on the books , albeit with reduced pay and hours ; local and regional elites trumpet low unemployment ; and the populace patiently accepts the cuts in the hopes of improved wages " after the crisis . 
" As in the [LOC Pikalevo  ] case , that comprise can break down quickly if an owner 's fears about consequences for letting arrears pile up or firing staff are less than the possible gains for letting uneconomic enterprises collapse . 
Ordering governors to be more assertive does little to provide them political power to actually follow through on the assignment , especially against powerful oligarchs . 
Large and in Charge ------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Putin  ] 's intervention in [LOC Pikalevo  ] also raised questions about balance of power within the tandem . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] asked why [PER Putin  ] , and not [PER Medvedev  ] , was dispatched to the town an issue that many here are puzzling over . 
Some argue , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , that the showdown between [PER Putin  ] and [PER Oleg Deripaska  ] was staged political theater . 
Since the money to revive the BazelTsement came through government loans in an agreement between the two before the visit , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] saw no reason for the Prime Minister to go to [LOC Pikalevo  ] except to show the masses his ability to battle the hated oligarchs . 
( [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also claimed that the proposal to nationalize the three plants in [LOC Pikalevo  ] was a conspiracy between [PER Deripaska  ] and the two [ORG United Russia  ] deputies who drafted the proposal , since [PER Deripaska  ] would have loved to unload the debt-ridden and inefficient firm on the taxpayers . 
) In an earlier conversation with Embassy , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] had argued that he saw [PER Medvedev  ] as confidently in control and serving as " the " President of [LOC Russia  ] , suggesting that he sees [PER Putin  ] 's involvement as a way of asserting his continued political importance. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] 's argument runs against the conventional wisdom that [PER Putin  ] remains the fulcrum of power in the tandem . 
Others explained the Prime Minister 's intervention as another illustration of [PER Putin  ] 's continued position as the arbiter amongst the [LOC Kremlin  ] clans . 
Indeed , [PER Medvedev  ] had given [PER Serdyukov  ] clear instructions to resolve the impasse over BazelTsement in March , but did not follow through to see that his instructions were implemented . 
We do not know if [PER Medvedev  ] himself directed [PER Putin  ] to take action in [LOC Pikalevo  ] , or was even apprised of the Prime Minister 's intentions . 
Whatever the case behind the scenes , [PER Putin  ] 's intervention provided a clear signal to the elite and society that he remains the tandem 's decision implementer . 
As [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] described it , [PER Putin  ] 's trip to [LOC Pikalevo  ] showed that " he 's the tsar , he decides all problems . 
" <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The laurels of the " tsar " come with heavy responsibility and nearly all independent observers agree that [PER Putin  ] 's intervention will have the likely consequence of [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00001562 003 OF 003 more localized protests . 
The success of the [LOC Pikalevo  ] workers' highway blockade provides a model for other disgruntled or frustrated workers in other " one-company towns " to attract top-level attention to their problems . 
[PER Medvedev  ] 's caution to the governors June 10 that the center will no longer send " someone " to resolve local issues had far less flash than [PER Putin  ] 's actions on June 4 . 
Comment ------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Putin  ] 's [LOC Pikalevo  ] intervention , followed by his surprise announcement that [LOC Russia  ] would drop its independent bid for [ORG WTO  ] accession in lieu of a joint bid with [LOC Kazakhstan  ] and [LOC Belarus  ] ( Ref A ) , has put the Prime Minister in the spotlight at the expense of [PER Medvedev  ] . 
[PER Medvedev  ] appears to be playing " catch up " through his tough talk to the PolPreds ( his representatives to regional blocs ) on June 10 and a photo op sighting down the barrel of a sniper scope in [LOC Makachkala  ] ( after the murder of the head of the local [ORG Internal Affairs  ] Minister ) . 
[LOC Pikalevo  ] served to confirm the stereotypes about the two men -- [PER Medvedev  ] is a man of words , hobnobbing with [MISC Western  ] businessmen in [LOC St. Petersburg  ] ; [PER Putin  ] is the man of action , setting the oligarchs straight in the provinces . 
Neither appears to see fully the systemic problems inherent in the [PER Putin  ] system , but [PER Medvedev  ] at a minimum seems more open to hearing a broader range of criticism . 
[PER Putin  ] apparently retains his conspiratorial worldview , even muttering about the [LOC Pikalevo  ] protest being the result of forces colluding to stop him from coming to the town . 
If the situation deteriorates in the coming months with a surge of localized protest , [PER Medvedev  ] may be in a better position to promote a reform agenda that tackles the underlying issues , rather that papering over problems with a diminishing pot of government money .
