[LOC BRASILIA  ] 000043 <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
[LOC BRASILIA  ] 001664 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Clifford Sobel  ] . 
Reasons: 1.4 ( B and D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) [MISC Summary:  ] The relationship between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] is as productive and broad-based as it as ever been , the result of the excellent relationship between President [PER Bush  ] and President [PER Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  ] , new cooperation mechanisms on biofuels , business issues , and economic matters , and our shared goals of fostering hemispheric stability , promoting democracy , developing a consensus on next steps regarding climate change , and achieving a mutually satisfactory conclusion to the [LOC Doha  ] round of [LOC WTO  ] negotiations . 
Cooperation on law enforcement issues , such as counternarcotics , container security , and intelligence sharing , are highlights of the bilateral relationship . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] officials at the policy level , however , are always keen to underplay the range of organized criminal activities , including arms and narcotics trafficking and money laundering that takes place in the Argentina/Brazil/Paraguay tri-border area ( [ORG TBA  ] ) . 
U.S.-Brazil cooperation on foreign policy issues is often limited by the [ORG GoB  ] 's unwillingness to speak out against anti-democratic actions in the hemisphere ( [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] ) , take proactive steps to address key issues such as nuclear proliferation and counterterrorist concerns , and expand its international leadership in meaningful ways . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's ethanol program has made it a global model for alternative energy and offers potential for bilateral cooperation on an important strategic issue . 
On the environment , [LOC Brazil  ] has long been on the defensive about the ongoing , extensive deforestation of the [LOC Amazon  ] , which has made [LOC Brazil  ] one of the leading producers of greenhouse gases . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] labor movement is strong , well-organized , and very influential in many key industrial sectors . 
[PER Lula  ] came out of the organized labor movement and labor and social issues have always been among his top priorities . 
Trafficking in [MISC Persons  ] is present in all of its forms in [LOC Brazil  ] , but the [ORG GoB  ] is making a serious effort to combat it . 
End Summary. ---------------------------------- [PER Lula Popular  ] , but What [MISC Comes  ] Next ? ---------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) With a 67 percent approval rating , President [PER Lula  ] is more popular than at any other point since he took office in <a id='par2003' href='#par2003'>¶</a>2003 . 
Continuity and legacy are the guiding lights of [PER Lula  ] 's second term . 
[PER Lula  ] continues to shape his legacy as a friend of the poor and builder of a foundation for prosperity for the lower and middle classes through broad social welfare programs and a vast , new economic growth program of public works and growth incentives . 
At the same time , [PER Lula  ] has failed to promote needed reforms to abolish a political culture of corruption , clientelism , and spoils . 
Although a seemingly endless series of corruption scandals has not dented his personal popularity or that of his government , these scandals have felled political allies , including cabinet ministers , in recent years. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) [PER Lula  ] is concerned with finding an electable successor for 2010 , and appears to be grooming his top domestic policy adviser , Minister [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] , while keeping other options open . 
Attention in the media and among the political elite is already focused on the race ; the opposition governor of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] state and former presidential candidate , [PER Jose Serra  ] , currently leads the pack of possible candidates. ----------------------------------- [LOC Latin America  ] 's [ORG Economic Powerhouse  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) President [PER Lula  ] and his economic team , s prudent fiscal and monetary policies and reform efforts are a major reason for his popularity and have resulted in [LOC Brazil  ] , s position as the tenth largest economy in the world , with a trade surplus and , just this year , achievement of a [MISC BBB-minus  ] ( lowest investment grade ) credit rating . 
Annual GDP growth was approximately 5.4 percent for 2007 , with inflation within its target range at 4 percent . 
Buoyed by exports and investment inflows , [LOC Brazil  ] 's currency , the Real , has remained strong , and the government has succeeded in paying down its external debt . 
However , there are major structural challenges to long term growth . 
Real interest rates are among the highest in the world . 
The informal sector constitutes an estimated 40 percent of the economy , in part due to the tax burden ( 34.2 percent of GDP in 2006 ) , one of the highest among large developing economies . 
[LOC Brazil  ] , s opaque and onerous regulatory and legal system , as well as poor transport and [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000823 002 OF 006 other infrastructure , continue to constrain growth. ------------------------------------------- [ORG Friendly Cooperation  ] , Not Strong Friendship ------------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Bilaterally , the [ORG GoB  ] has pursued generally friendly relations with the [LOC United States  ] and we continue to seek opportunities for positive bilateral cooperation . 
Following the signing of the biofuels [ORG MOU  ] in March 2007 , [LOC Brazil  ] and the [LOC United States  ] have been seeking ways to increase our collaboration toward the next generation of biofuels , as well as in developing international standards on biofuels which should facilitate greater international acceptance and use of biofuels . 
The [ORG Economic Policy Dialogue  ] ( [ORG EPD  ] ) launched last year provides an important opportunity to reinforce our view of [LOC Brazil  ] as partner . 
Cooperation to foster innovation and agricultural coordination , to possibly include assistance to [MISC African  ] countries , are new topics of conversation bilaterally . 
Additionally , we have been working to develop a regional infrastructure initiative . 
We have been exploring one another , s regulatory frameworks in hopes of addressing barriers and achieving a Bilateral [ORG Tax Treaty  ] and a Bilateral [ORG Investment Treaty  ] . 
Civil aviation is an area of renewed focus with the next round of talks scheduled for the week of June 23rd . 
There are also continuing efforts under the auspices of the bilateral CEO Forum to address issues of common interest. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Nonetheless , the [ORG GoB  ] continues to favor building ties with developing nations over closer relations with the [LOC United States  ] and other developed nations . 
While seeking to expand our bilateral dialogue , the [ORG GoB  ] has studiously avoided working closely with us on broad strategic issues important to us . 
Those issues on which it has been willing to work with us--biofuels , investment , and climate change , for example--are areas where the [ORG GoB  ] considers itself a visibly equal partner . 
The exception may be security-related issues , where the appointment of [PER Nelson Jobim  ] as Defense Minister has brought new interest in cooperation . 
But it appears that in this area , as with our efforts on counternarcotics , environmental protection , counterterrorism , and other issues , the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] is seeking to maintain its historic dominance and distance from the [LOC United States  ] , which it does by controlling the agenda and throwing up barriers that delay and sometimes scuttle bilateral efforts that other ministries support. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Brazilian  ] public has a mixed view of the [LOC United States  ] . 
Seventy-five percent say relations between [LOC Brazil  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] are very good or fairly good , and [MISC Brazilians  ] by a wide margin consider the [LOC U.S.  ] the most important country in the region for [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Those who follow the news know that [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] cooperation on trade issues has global importance and new areas of cooperation such as biofuels are potentially significant . 
There has been a much more positive view of [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] cooperation since the signing of the biofuels [ORG MOU  ] last year . 
On the other hand , there is a good deal of skepticism about [LOC U.S.  ] foreign policy , particularly on issues such as [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] . 
There is resentment over the long wait times for [LOC U.S.  ] visa applications , a product of a spike in demand without commensurate increases in staffing. -------------------------------------- Hesitant Globally ; Cautious Regionally -------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [LOC Brazil  ] 's foreign policy is dominated by symbolic steps to burnish its [MISC South-South  ] credentials and status as an emerging leader , rather than by resolute attention to core political and economic interests , including strengthening bilateral political and trade relations with the [LOC United States  ] . 
The attainment of a permanent seat on the [ORG UN Security Council  ] has been a central tenet of [LOC Brazil  ] 's foreign policy under President [PER Lula  ] 's government , and most of its actions on the international stage are geared toward that goal . 
However , [LOC Brazil  ] has largely failed to assume the international leadership role that would make it a strong candidate for such a position . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's latest two-year stint on the [ORG UNSC  ] , which ended in January 2006 , was characterized by caution and equivocation rather than vision and leadership . 
The [ORG GoB  ] has so far not used its significant contribution to stability in [LOC Haiti  ] as a step along the road to becoming a champion of international peace and security . 
For example , the [ORG GoB  ] has yet to respond to repeated requests for assistance with peacekeeping in [LOC Darfur.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [LOC Brazil  ] 's general desire not to be too closely identified with the [LOC U.S.  ] is borne out in non-proliferation . 
[LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000823 003 OF 006 The [ORG GoB  ] has expressed approval of the [ORG Proliferation Security Initiative  ] ( [ORG PSI  ] ) , but has not yet endorsed the [ORG PSI  ] statement of principles . 
[LOC Brazil  ] has also not yet signed the [MISC NPT Additional Protocol  ] , although it has not ruled out signing it in the near future . 
The [ORG GoB  ] consistently refused to take a strong position against [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear efforts , questioning the effort to refer [LOC Iran  ] to the [ORG Security Council  ] until the vote in the [ORG IAEA  ] had become a foregone conclusion . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] officials consider their seat at the table in [LOC Annapolis  ] as a foreign policy success and see themselves as balanced in their dealings with [LOC Israel  ] and the [MISC Palestinians  ] , but they have yet to define a substantive role for [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[PER FM Amorim  ] 's suggestion recently that [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Syria  ] , [ORG Hamas  ] , and [ORG Hizbollah  ] should be included in the negotiations suggest continuing naivete regarding the peace process and [LOC Middle East  ] relations , as does his recent remark to a [LOC U.S.  ] official that [LOC Brazil  ] 's growing " friendship " with [LOC Iran  ] will prove useful should the [LOC United States  ] , in the future , decide to engage [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Regionally , [PER Lula  ] has maintained [LOC Brazil  ] 's historic focus on stability , seeing dialogue and good relations with all parties as the best way to achieve this goal . 
As a result , [LOC Brazil  ] maintains an active dialogue with and refuses to criticize human rights violations in [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] , has worked hard to restore relations with [LOC Bolivia  ] even at the expense of its own economic interests , and stood firmly on the principle of respect for sovereignty , with only minimal mention of counterterrorism concerns , in responding to the recent dispute between [LOC Colombia  ] and [LOC Ecuador.  ] --------------------------- [ORG Law Enforcement Cooperation  ] --------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Cooperation on security and law enforcement issues is a highlight of the bilateral relationship , and a potential area for increased cooperation as public security is frequently cited in opinion polls as the most pressing concern for [MISC Brazilians  ] . 
The newly arrived [ORG Resident Legal Advisor  ] is working in support of [ORG USG  ] law enforcement agencies and the political and economic sections to expand and intensify our relations with the judiciary , prosecutors , and [MISC Brazilian  ] law enforcement . 
We hope this year to seat another [MISC Brazilian  ] observer at [LOC JIATF-S  ] . 
Also , the [ORG GoB  ] has expressed interest in negotiating a General Security of [ORG Information Agreement  ] ( [ORG GSOIA  ] ) . 
The [ORG Narcotics Affairs Section  ] ( NAS ) expects to sign a new Letter of [ORG Agreement  ] shorly , which will allow us to move forward to expad cooperation on counternarcotics and countercrie issues , including at the state level . 
The GoBcooperates with the [ORG USG  ] on the operational level in the fight against terrorism , document fraud , ad drug trafficking . 
Information sharing at the orking level between [MISC Brazilian  ] and [LOC US  ] law enforcemnt and intelligence agencies is productive . 
Brail has been a valuable partner in the efforts to secure our own borders against terrorism through ts support for [ORG DHS  ] 's [ORG Container Security Initiatie  ] ( [ORG CSI  ] ) , its implementation of enhanced passenge screening at airports and its fulfillment of the [ORG International Maritime Organization  ] ( [ORG IMO  ] ) [ORG ISPS  ] code on port and ship security . 
Immigration and [ORG Cusoms Enforcement  ] ( [ORG ICE  ] ) is also currently working ith the [MISC Brazilian  ] authorities to detect financia and smuggling violations , financial crimes and commercial fraud with the assistance of the [ORG Trade Transparency Unit  ] ( [ORG TTU  ] ) initiative. --------------------------- Cooperation on Cybercrimes --------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( U ) Assisting [LOC Brazil  ] in creating legislation to counter cybercrimes , including online child pornography and tracking of sex offenders , represents another potential area of cooperation on law enforcement matters . 
[LOC Brazil  ] lacks cybercrime laws and the [ORG Congress  ] has opened a [ORG Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry  ] ( [ORG CPI  ] ) to look at the issue and come up with draft legislation . 
As part of the [ORG CPI  ] 's work , the [ORG CPI  ] was able to obtain over 3,000 [ORG Google  ] records of identified child pornography that had been distributed on the [MISC Internet  ] from [LOC Brazil  ] . 
The chairman of the [ORG CPI  ] has voiced his concern about , in his view , inadequate cooperation from [ORG Google  ] and its subsidiary [PER Orkut  ] , a relationship site . 
[ORG Google  ] , [PER Orkut  ] , [ORG Microsoft  ] , and all other [MISC Internet  ] service providers are required to report the discovery of child pornography on the [MISC Internet  ] and [ORG DHS/ICE  ] has established a mechanism to have access to this information which has been reported . 
[ORG DHS/ICE  ] has already initiated the practice of sharing this information with [ORG Brazilian Federal Police  ] . 
Related to the [ORG CPI  ] , its Chairman has made inquiries to the Mission on the [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000823 004 OF 006 case of [ORG DHS/ICE Deportation  ] officer accused of child exploitation at a hotel in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] is seeking the toughest penalty possible , whether in [LOC Brazil  ] or the [LOC U.S.  ] , and is fully cooperating with [MISC Brazilian  ] authorities. --------------------------------------------- ---------------- [ORG Counterterrorism: Operational Cooperation  ] ; [PER Policy-Level Equivocation  ] --------------------------------------------- ---------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Cooperation on counterterrorism matters remains good at the operational level , and we regularly obtain valuable information from [ORG GoB  ] sources on terrorism . 
The [PER Lula  ] administration just re-structured its intelligence apparatus to beef up their counterterrorism focus . 
The senior policy levels of the [ORG GoB  ] , however , have refused to publicly endorse [LOC U.S.  ] counterterrorism initiatives and , wary of [LOC Brazil  ] 's large , prosperous and influential [MISC Arab  ] population , make every effort to downplay in public even the possibility of terrorist fund-raising going on inside [LOC Brazil  ] , a situation exacerbated by their refusal to consider [ORG Hizballah  ] or [ORG HAMAS  ] as terrorist organizations . 
The [PER Lula  ] administration failed to introduce long-delayed draft legislation outlawing terrorist-related activity , including its financing. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( U ) The governments of [LOC Argentina  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] , and [LOC Paraguay  ] have long been concerned over illicit activities in the tri-border area ( [ORG TBA  ] ) joining [LOC Foz de Iguacu  ] in [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Ciudad del Este  ] in [LOC Paraguay  ] , and [LOC Puerto Iguazu  ] in [LOC Argentina  ] . 
The [ORG TBA  ] concentrates a range of organized criminal activities , including arms and narcotics trafficking , document fraud , money laundering , as well as the manufacture and movement of contraband goods . 
A wide variety of counterfeit goods , including cigarettes , CDs , DVDs , and computer software , are moved from [LOC Asia  ] into [LOC Paraguay  ] and transported primarily across the border into [LOC Brazil  ] . 
This inflow of illicit goods stands to be increased with the potential passage of legislation that purports to ease customs procedures for small-scale importers but , due to a lack of enforcement provisions , would likely serve to abet traffickers . 
The [LOC United States  ] remains concerned that [ORG Hizballah  ] and [ORG HAMAS  ] are raising funds in the [ORG TBA  ] by participating in illicit activities and soliciting donations from extremists within the sizable [MISC Muslim  ] communities in the region. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( U ) In the 1990s the three governments established a mechanism , which the [LOC US  ] joined in 2002 at their invitation , to address illicit activities in the [ORG TBA  ] . 
The " 3 1 Group on [ORG Tri-border Area Security  ] " is intended to improve the capabilities of the three [ORG TBA  ] states to thwart cross-border criminal activity and potential terrorist fundraising activity . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is an active partner within this mechanism , but the effectiveness of this group is hampered by [ORG GoB  ] denials of any potential terrorist activity taking place in their territory ( see reftels ) . 
The suggestion that planning for the 1994 bombing of [LOC AMIA  ] , an [MISC Argentine Jewish  ] center , might have taken place in [LOC Brazil  ] caused the [ORG GoB  ] to abstain in an international vote over whether to issue [ORG Interpol  ] warrants for [MISC Iranian  ] officials accused in the case , an action that disappointed and irritated [LOC Argentina  ] . 
Nonetheless , [LOC Brazil  ] has established and hosts a [ORG Joint Intelligence Center  ] ( [ORG JIC  ] ) in [LOC Foz  ] de [LOC Iguacu  ] to combat transnational criminal activity , although staffing issues on the part of [LOC Argentina  ] and [LOC Paraguay  ] continue to impede its full functioning. --------------------------------------------- -------- Labor and Trafficking in [MISC Persons: An Improving Record  ] --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The labor movement in [LOC Brazil  ] is strong , well-organized , and very influential in many key industrial sectors . 
President [PER Lula  ] comes from the labor movement . 
He worked his way up through the powerful metal workers union , was one of the founders of the largest [MISC Brazilian  ] labor confederations -- the [ORG Unified Workers Confederation of Brazil  ] ( CUT ) -- and of the ruling [ORG Workers Party  ] ( [ORG PT  ] ) . 
Labor and related social issues , such as combating Trafficking in [MISC Persons  ] ( TIP ) , and forced labor , are important priorities of the [ORG Lula Administration  ] . 
The [ORG Lula Government  ] 's commitment to social issues is exemplified by its popular [ORG Bolsa Familia  ] ( Family Stipend ) program which involves direct cash pay outs to over 11 million families as an incentive for low-income [MISC Brazilians  ] to keep their children in school and up-to-date with their immunizations . 
Most economists and policymakers agree that labor reform is necessary for the [MISC Brazilian  ] economy to grow at a faster rate and to reduce the large informal sector , which employees close to 45 percent of all [MISC Brazilian  ] workers . 
However , comprehensive labor reform is politically unpopular and unlikely to happen during the [ORG Lula BRASILIA  ] 00000823 005 OF 006 Administration. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The use of child labor and the exploitation of children for sexual purposes is widespread in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
NGOs estimate that there are at least 240,000 children working illegally , although the number may be much higher . 
The [ORG Federal Police  ] estimate that at least 250,000 children are involved in prostitution , while some [ORG NGO  ] 's put the number as high as 500,000 . 
Many work in the poor northeastern sector of [LOC Brazil  ] where there is a booming sex tourism industry catering mostly to [MISC Europeans  ] , and to a lesser extent , [ORG Americans.  ] <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( U ) Trafficking in [MISC Persons  ] is present in all of its forms in [LOC Brazil  ] , including the trafficking of women and children internally and internationally for purposes of sexual exploitation , the internal trafficking of men for use in slave or forced labor in the cattle-raising and agricultural sectors , and in the production of charcoal , some of which is used to produce pig iron . 
There are an undocumented number of foreign laborers working in slave-like conditions in factories in the city and state of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] . 
However , the [ORG GoB  ] is making a serious effort to combat TIP and forced/slave labor . 
It signed the [ORG Palermo Protocol  ] in 2004 and is now working to get implementing legislation passed by the [ORG Congress  ] . 
President [PER Lula  ] signed a decree in October 2006 establishing a national anti-TIP policy . 
A binding work plan to implement that policy was publicly in January 2008 . 
Ministry of Labor mobile inspection teams have freed over 29,000 laborers from slave-like working conditions since starting work in 1993 . 
The inspection teams freed over 5,900 forced labor victims last year ( 2007 ) alone. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As a result of reports of slave or forced labor in the production of charcoal used to produce pig iron , in September of last year the Mission requested the [ORG GoB  ] 's concurrence in having DHS/ICE personnel work with the appropriate ministries and agencies in the [MISC Brazilian  ] government to investigate allegations that [MISC American  ] companies may have received products produced in [LOC Brazil  ] with the possible use of forced labor . 
So far , the [MISC Brazilian  ] government has not responded to our requests. --------------------------------------------- -------------- Protecting [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Borders: Extreme Sensitivity  ] on Sovereignty --------------------------------------------- -------------- <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( U ) There is long-standing and widespread fear among [MISC Brazilians  ] that the [LOC United States  ] or other foreigners want to take over or internationalize the [LOC Amazon  ] . 
Although demonstrably unfounded , it surfaces regularly in official and media circles , as with President [PER Lula  ] 's recent assertions that " The [LOC Amazon  ] has an owner . 
" More recently , the prospect of enormous oil reserves off [LOC Brazil  ] 's coast have added new fears that the [LOC United States  ] or others might have designs on these , as well . 
Some [MISC Brazilians  ] have linked the just-announced re-establishment of the [ORG U.S. Fourth Fleet  ] to these [MISC Brazilian  ] oil discoveries . 
However , most [MISC Brazilians  ] do not realize that the [ORG Fourth Fleet  ] consists solely of a planning staff of approximately 80 people based in [LOC Florida  ] , and that it has no permanently assigned ships . 
Its main missions will be support of peacekeeping operations , such as in [LOC Haiti  ] , respond to natural disasters , such as Hurricane [PER Felix  ] in [LOC Nicaragua  ] , organize humanitarian relief , typically of a medical nature , and assist counternarcotics efforts . 
Standing up the [ORG Fourth Fleet  ] intends to demonstrate the priority the [LOC United States  ] places on its partnerships in [LOC Latin America  ] and will help ensure that [LOC Latin America  ] remains a high priority for [LOC U.S.  ] engagement. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( U ) There have also been some rumors about the permanent stationing of a ship in [MISC Brazilian  ] waters by the [ORG US Navy  ] in light of the recent the port visit of the [MISC USS  ] [PER George Washington  ] CVN-73 . 
The [ORG U.S. Navy  ] has no vessels in [MISC Brazilian  ] waters and has not had any since the [MISC USS  ] [PER George Washington  ] departed [MISC Brazilian  ] territorial waters in early May . 
By policy , the [ORG U.S. Navy  ] will not enter territorial waters of any national without diplomatic clearance and the cooperation of the host nation. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( U ) Defense Minister [PER Nelson Jobim  ] stated publicly in early June that [LOC Brazil  ] needed to improve security for its off-shore oil resources and that , as permitted by the [ORG UN Convention  ] on the Law of the [LOC Sea  ] ( [ORG UNCLOS  ] ) , [LOC Brazil  ] was planning to increase the 200-mile exclusive economic zone to 350 miles to include the [LOC Santos  ] basin and other oil deposits located on [LOC Brazil  ] 's continental shelf. . 
Although there were suggestions in the press that the [LOC United States  ] might not [ORG BRASILIA  ] 00000823 006 OF 006 respect such an extension because we have not ratified [ORG UNCLOS  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] does fully respect exclusive economic zones established pursuant to customary international law as reflected in [ORG UNCLOS  ] . 
Furthermore , the [LOC US  ] has established its own exclusive economic zone according to the same customary international law . 
[ORG UNCLOS  ] recognizes the sovereign rights of a coastal State over its continental shelf , which extends out to 200 nautical miles--and beyond , if it meets specific criteria . 
These rights include sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring the continental shelf and exploiting its natural resources , including oil , gas , and other energy resources .
