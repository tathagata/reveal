( C ) Assistant Secretary ( [ORG A/S  ] ) [ORG Carson  ] met with members of the [ORG International Oil Companies  ] ( [ORG IOCs  ] ) on February 7 . 
The [ORG A/S  ] stressed the fact that [LOC Nigeria  ] is the most important country in [LOC Africa  ] for the [LOC United States  ] . 
The [ORG IOC  ] members noted that the [ORG A/S  ] spoke mainly of issues in [LOC Northern Nigeria  ] and did not dwell on [MISC Southern  ] issues . 
The [ORG Petroleum Industry Bill  ] is discouraging future investment mostly in deep-water fields where most of the remaining oil in [LOC Nigeria  ] lies . 
If [LOC Nigeria  ] raised the price of gas to two-thirds of the world price , the [MISC IOC’s  ] would be at each others throats trying to cut the price by a penny or two . 
[LOC Nigeria  ] has the possibility of becoming the next [LOC Pakistan  ] within 25 years . 
[ORG A/S Carson  ] allayed the [ORG IOCs  ] concerns of the [LOC United States’  ] relationship with [LOC China  ] . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Assistant Secretary [PER Carson  ] met with members of the international oil community in [LOC Lagos  ] on February 7 . 
In attendance were the following: [ORG Shell Senior Vice President’s  ] [PER Ann Pickard  ] and [PER Ian Craig  ] ; [ORG Shell Vice  ] President [PER Peter Robinson  ] ; [ORG Chevron Managing  ] Director [PER Andrew Fawthrop  ] ; [ORG Chevron Public Affairs Manager Femi Odumabo  ] ; [ORG Exxon Mobil Managing  ] Director [PER Mark Ward  ] ; [ORG Hercules Manager Coleman McDonough  ] ; [ORG Schlumberger Manager Supply Chain Service  ] Demi Adenusi ; [ORG American Business Council  ] ( [ORG ABC  ] ) President [PER Dick Kramer  ] ; Special Assistant to the Assistant Secretary ; Economic Officer ; Maritime Affairs Officer ; Marine AttachC ) and , [ORG Consul General Lagos.  ] ----------------------------------------- NIGERIA: MOST IMPORTANT COUNTRY IN [LOC AFRICA  ] ----------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Fawthrop  ] asked the [ORG A/S  ] whether he was in [LOC Nigeria  ] to deliver a message or was it more of a fact-finding trip ? 
[ORG A/S Carson  ] stated that he was in [LOC Nigeria  ] for both reasons in that he wanted to listen and engage with [LOC Nigeria  ] . 
[LOC Nigeria  ] is the most important country in [LOC Africa  ] for the [LOC United States  ] due to: the size of its population ; presence of hydro-carbons ; peace keeping role in [LOC ECOWAS  ] , especially in [LOC Sierra Leone  ] and [LOC Liberia  ] ; its seat on the [ORG United Nations Security Council  ] ; along with the strength and size of its financial markets the [ORG A/S  ] continued . 
[LOC Nigeria  ] has enormous potential and is the seventh largest [MISC Muslim  ] country in the world with an [MISC Islamic  ] population that will eclipse [LOC Egypt  ] by 2015 according to [ORG A/S Carson  ] . 
Having no [LOC United States  ] presence in [LOC Northern Nigeria  ] is akin to having no presence in [LOC Egypt  ] and is why the [LOC United States  ] is considering opening a Consulate in [LOC Kano.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [LOC United States  ] is concerned about the power vacuum in [LOC Nigeria  ] and the state of health of President [PER Yar A’dua  ] , per [ORG A/S Carson  ] . 
The president is “very , very , very , very ill” and [MISC Nigerians  ] are under illusions regarding the state of their president. “Nigeria cannot afford to implode or run aground.” 30 years of military government was not good . 
The [LOC United States  ] expects a stable , legal , democratic , constitutionally-based government with no “military involvement , full stop” [ORG A/S Carson  ] stated . 
It is important for the [ORG GON  ] to do a better job this time around in regards to elections . 
Only ten percent of [MISC Nigerians  ] saw a ballot ticket in the 2007 elections . 
If [LOC Nigeria  ] brings credibility to its democratic processes , its economic processes will improve . 
[LOC LAGOS  ] 00000075 002 OF 005 --------------------------------------------- ------------- [ORG UNITED STATES  ] PRESENCE IN [MISC SOUTHERN  ] [LOC NIGERIA  ] NEEDS ATTENTION --------------------------------------------- ------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Some places are more important than others within the Federal system of [LOC Nigeria  ] and [LOC Lagos  ] is one of the more important places , according to [ORG A/S Carson  ] . 
Consulate General [LOC Lagos  ] is bigger and more important than [ORG Embassies Benin  ] and [LOC Togo  ] together . 
[LOC Lagos  ] is significantly more important than [LOC Cape Town  ] even though the latter is 100 times better in terms of livability . 
The [LOC United States  ] must be in [LOC Lagos  ] in a significant way , [ORG A/S Carson  ] declared. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The statements of the [ORG A/S  ] sounded wonderful from a [LOC Hausa  ] viewpoint , but nothing was mentioned about [MISC Southern  ] and [ORG Eastern Nigeria  ] , [PER Fawthrop  ] pointed out . 
The [ORG A/S  ] agreed that [PER Fawthrop  ] was correct . 
The [LOC United States  ] is underrepresented diplomatically , economically , commercially , militarily and from a security standpoint . 
When the [ORG A/S  ] served in [LOC Nigeria  ] from 1969-1971 , the [LOC United States  ] had the [MISC Embassy  ] in [LOC Lagos  ] with [LOC Consulates  ] in [LOC Ibadan  ] , [LOC Kaduna  ] , and briefly in [LOC Port Harcourt  ] , before the Civil war , and also a [MISC USIS  ] post in [LOC Kano  ] . 
With the [MISC Nigerian  ] population at 50 million the [LOC United States  ] was better and more broadly represented in a [LOC Nigeria  ] that produced almost no oil . 
With an [MISC Embassy  ] in [LOC Abuja  ] and a Consulate in [LOC Lagos  ] , the [LOC United States  ] has experienced a “huge loss” in [LOC Nigeria  ] today , per [ORG A/S Carson  ] . 
The [LOC United States  ] must get back into [LOC Enugu  ] and [ORG Port Harcourt.  ] “No presence means no access , which leads to no influence . 
Without influence you have nothing.” <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Akwa Ibom  ] governor [PER Godswill Akpabio  ] was singled out as an impressive governor by [PER Mark Ward  ] . 
[PER Akpabio  ] has built up infrastructure and industrial development . 
He is “one to watch” per [PER Ward  ] . 
Other [MISC Southern  ] governors that were highlighted included were [LOC Rivers State  ] governor [PER Chibulke Amaechi  ] and [LOC Edo State  ] governor [LOC Oshiomhole  ] . 
[PER Fawthrop  ] suggested that [ORG USAID  ] has a lot to offer in the [LOC South  ] in that if [ORG USAID  ] makes a mistake it is [LOC OK  ] . 
If a private company engages in a similar project and makes a mistake you have a [LOC FCPA  ] investigation . 
The [ORG Consul General  ] ( [LOC CG  ] ) added that it might be possible to team up with security assets of the [ORG IOCs  ] to arrange diplomatic trips to the [LOC Niger Delta  ] . 
This arrangement would not happen “100 percent of the time , ” but more often than not , per the [MISC CG.  ] ------------------------------------- STATUS OF THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY BILL ------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The [ORG PIB  ] is more about taking control and not a real solution , per [PER Mark Ward  ] . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX There are currently three versions between the [ORG Senate  ] , [ORG House  ] , and Interagency committee and it is unclear when and what will materialize , according to [PER Ward  ] . 
[PER Fawthrop  ] added that the [ORG PIB  ] amounts to resource nationalization and stated that it costs more than 40 percent to develop the oil as opposed to leaving it in the ground . 
The current fiscals of the [ORG PIB  ] estimate that is costs 25 percent to develop the oil , thereby creating a disincentive . 
If the oil stays in the ground then billions of development money will go away and the resulting slowdown will be a massive problem . 
The [ORG IOCs  ] received a lecture from a team made up of various [ORG GON  ] agencies ( the interagency team ) in [LOC Abuja  ] In a recent meeting in an example of the current level of communication per [PER Fawthrop  ] . 
The whole group then went to the office of the Vice President where the interagency team stated that there was very good communication between them and the [MISC IOCs.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The large fields , elephants , have all been developed in [LOC LAGOS  ] 00000075 003 OF 005 [LOC Nigeria  ] per [PER Fawthrop  ] . 
What remains are fields one-quarter to one-third the size . 
The same costs are involved in producing the oil but the revenue will be less because there is less oil . 
The [ORG IOCs  ] need more incentive , not less , in order to develop these fields profitably . 
What the [ORG PIB  ] accomplishes is a disincentive . 
The downstream sector is very simple in [LOC Nigeria  ] in that the refined gas is moved from one tanker to another , to a smaller tanker and then sold . 
The refining sector , exploration and production sectors are very complex . 
It is unrealistic for the [ORG PIB  ] to try to change all of these areas in one tome of legislation , asserted [ORG Fawthrop.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The gas side of the [ORG PIB  ] tries to legislate the delivery of gas rather than incentivize it. “The donkey is tired and beaten . 
It will not go no matter what you tell it” stated [PER Fawthrop  ] . 
If the gas price went to two thirds of the world price the [ORG IOCs  ] would “cut each others throat” to cut the price by one or two cents . 
The rest of the [ORG IOC  ] members nodded in agreement to this statement by [PER Fawthrop  ] . 
[MISC European  ] gas competition has gas developed on a cost plus basis adding about eight percent to the cost . 
The model should be based on rate of return and not forced upon operators by legislative decree. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Whenever gas doubles the cost of electricity goes up by one quarter . 
Stable electricity will allow industry to flourish in [LOC Nigeria  ] but this will not happen 15 months before the elections . 
Amateur technocrats run the oil and gas sector according to Shell’s [PER Peter Robinson  ] . 
They believe that they can control the industry via spreadsheets and pushing through the [ORG PIB  ] . 
There are many emotional issues in the [ORG PIB  ] with [MISC Nigerian  ] politicians believing that they make no money on deep-water projects . 
Potential banker and businessmen partners do not understand the industry . 
The [ORG GON  ] has made USD 2.5 billion with no investment in the past two years according to [MISC Robinson.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) A large problem will be the ten percent of equity that is to go to the communities argued [PER Fawthrop  ] . 
Equity going into the communities will make them explode . 
The recipients of the monies will be highly disappointed when they see the amount they will receive , a much larger sum will be expected . 
[PER Kramer  ] referred to the community equity as the “lawyer relief act” and wondered how one defines an actual community. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Peter Robinson  ] stated after the meeting that [PER Pedro Van Meurs  ] , the oil consultant hired by the [ORG GON  ] to help negotiate with the [ORG IOCs  ] , is considering leaving . 
[PER Van Meurs  ] has been trying to show the [ORG GON  ] officials that their fiscal math does not work with the [ORG PIB  ] . 
[PER Van Meurs  ] does not agree with the [ORG IOC  ] position completely but sees areas for improvement . 
One example given to [LOC Lagos  ] Econoff by [ORG Exxon Mobil Project Manager Anh Tran  ] concerned the levels of cost involved with deep-water projects . 
[ORG Exxon  ] , and other [ORG IOCs  ] , maintain that their capital costs are at least 40 percent of deep-water projects while the [ORG GON  ] allows for 25 percent capital costs under the [ORG PIB  ] . 
[PER Van Meurs  ] agreed that 25 percent was not adequate. -------------------------------- WHERE DOES [LOC NIGERIA  ] GO FROM HERE ? -------------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) It is possible that [LOC Nigeria  ] could be a future [LOC Pakistan  ] according to [ORG A/S Carson  ] . 
In 25 years , there could be impoverished masses , a wealthy elite and radicalism in the [LOC North  ] . 
The question is whether the oil wells will be dry as well and could [LOC Nigeria  ] be on “sustainable and irreversible glide path to a new economic base” per the [ORG A/S  ] . 
When you look at the 2020/20 plan by the [ORG GON  ] you see that [LOC Nigeria  ] needs to grow by 14 percent a year to [LOC LAGOS  ] 00000075 004 OF 005 be at the current level of [LOC Indonesia  ] [PER Fawthrop  ] asserted . 
That is using today’s figures , which does not take into account Indonesia’s growth [PER Kramer  ] added . 
[LOC Nigeria  ] is growing at five percent now and would need 20 percent growth per annum in energy and USD 22 billion investment in power plants [PER Fawthrop  ] stated . 
What would happen if [LOC Nigeria  ] fell just short of their goals , would there be an alternative plan in place [PER Fawthrop  ] wondered ? 
He cited the example of the 2009 6,000 Megawatt goal . 
It was apparent early on that the goal was not feasible and an alternative plan could have been devised . 
The [ORG GON  ] insisted that they would reach their goal and did not develop alternatives . 
The same would hold true for 2020/20 [PER Fawthrop  ] assumed. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) The [ORG A/S  ] offered that a forum could be organized in [LOC Nigeria  ] with [ORG World Bank  ] President [PER Robert Zoellick  ] speaking to a wide audience . 
Under Secretary for Economic , Energy , and [ORG Agricultural Affairs Bob Hormats  ] would be invited as well to lend his knowledge of [LOC Africa  ] . 
The forum would be shaped with the broader picture in mind , not just oil . 
This would not be sponsored by the [ORG IOCs  ] . 
Members of the business community and individuals that were committed to making oil meaningful to Nigeria’s future would be asked to participate . 
Talk would center on “over the horizon” issues , where [LOC Nigeria  ] has gone right and where it has gone wrong . 
Two or three fora would be defined with key people to spark debate . 
Religious tensions , [MISC North-South  ] issues , the lack of capacity in the [ORG GON  ] , narco-trafficking , the growing irrelevance of [LOC Nigeria  ] , as [PER Princeton Lyman  ] has suggested , could be potential subjects . 
[LOC Nigeria  ] is at a critical financial and political threshold and the entire nation could possibly tip backwards permanently , per [ORG A/S Carson.  ] --------------------------------------- [MISC CHINESE  ] - AMERICAN RELATIONS IN [LOC AFRICA  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) What is the status of [MISC America’s  ] influence in [LOC Africa  ] and how does it compare to [LOC China  ] , [PER Fawthrop  ] queried ? 
The influence of the [LOC United States  ] has increased in [LOC Africa  ] , the [ORG A/S  ] countered . 
The [ORG United States’  ] reputation is stable and its popularity is the highest in [LOC Africa  ] compared to anywhere else in the world . 
[PER Obama  ] has helped to increase that influence. “We must manage the expectations of the [PER Obama  ] administration” offered the [ORG A/S  ] . 
The [LOC United States  ] does not consider [LOC China  ] a military , security or intelligence threat . 
[LOC China  ] is a very aggressive and pernicious economic competitor with no morals . 
[LOC China  ] is not in [LOC Africa  ] for altruistic reasons . 
[LOC China  ] is in [LOC Africa  ] for [LOC China  ] primarily . 
A secondary reason for China’s presence is to secure votes in the [ORG United Nations  ] from [MISC African  ] countries . 
A third reason is to prove that [LOC Taiwan  ] is not an issue . 
There are trip wires for the [LOC United States  ] when it comes to [LOC China  ] . 
Is [LOC China  ] developing a blue water navy ? 
Have they signed military base agreements ? 
Are they training armies ? 
Have they developed intelligence operations ? 
Once these areas start developing then the [LOC United States  ] will start worrying . 
The [LOC United States  ] will continue to push democracy and capitalism while [MISC Chinese  ] authoritarian capitalism is politically challenging . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] are dealing with the [MISC Mugabe’s  ] and Bashir’s of the world , which is a contrarian political model , [ORG A/S Carson  ] stated. ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [ORG A/S Carson  ] effectively provided the [ORG IOCs  ] with a rationale for the [ORG United States’  ] interest in [LOC Nigeria  ] and its commitment to the country . 
This commitment seems more substantial than the [ORG IOCs  ] given the prospect of the [ORG PIB  ] and the current state of play in [LOC Nigeria  ] . 
Providing the [ORG IOCs  ] with statements of support through continuing if not increasing the [ORG USG  ] presence in [LOC Nigeria  ] will be important in determining the increasing , decreasing or non-existent role of the [ORG IOCs  ] in the future in [LOC Nigeria  ] . 
As the [ORG A/S  ] stated , if we can have a substantial presence in [LOC Pakistan  ] , why not [LOC Nigeria  ] ? 
END COMMENT . 
[LOC LAGOS  ] 00000075 005 OF 005 <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( U ) [ORG A/S Carson  ] did not have an opportunity to clear this cable before departing post .
