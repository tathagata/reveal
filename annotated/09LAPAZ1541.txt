( C ) Summary: Our exchanges with [ORG European Union  ] representatives and an [ORG EU  ] working group paper underscore growing [MISC European  ] recognition of the need for intensified cooperation on counter-narcotics in [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
The [MISC Europeans  ] note increases in coca production , fear the introduction of third country criminal organizations , and recognize the loss in GOB capabilities with the expulsion of [ORG DEA  ] last year . 
Among proposals under consideration by the [ORG EU  ] are increases in technical assistance and alternative development , development of [ORG EU  ] member state law enforcement cooperation , better internal coordination , and strengthening [ORG CN  ] cooperation with neighboring countries . 
[ORG EU  ] officials are also keen to reopen the [ORG UNODC  ] office in [LOC La Paz  ] , and seek [LOC U.S.  ] assistance in pressing the [ORG UN  ] to do so quickly . 
Although [ORG EU  ] counter-narcotics efforts have so far been relatively modest and focused on alternative development , [ORG EU  ] officials generally share our assessments and are considering stepping up their engagement , including on law enforcement ( by individual member states ) and by pushing GOB reductions in coca cultivation . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) An internal policy paper prepared by the recently-formed [ORG EU  ] Drugs Working Group ( made up of representatives from local [ORG EU  ] missions ) highlights [MISC European  ] concerns about the worsening counter-narcotics situation in [LOC Bolivia  ] and the [MISC Europeans'  ] interest in doing more . 
The [ORG EU  ] paper notes the growth of cocaine use in [LOC Europe  ] -- the ultimate destination for most [MISC Bolivian  ] cocaine -- and the troubling increase in coca production in [LOC Bolivia  ] and other [MISC Andean  ] countries ( the [ORG EU  ] estimates 32-34,000 hectares under production in [LOC Bolivia  ] , slightly higher than the [ORG UNODC  ] 's figure of 30,500 ) . 
GOB efforts to control the legal coca market are seriously flawed , the [ORG EU  ] notes , while [MISC Bolivian  ] government interdiction remains hampered by the loss of [ORG DEA  ] 's logistical and intelligence support ( following [ORG DEA  ] 's expulsion in November 2008 ) . 
A major [MISC European  ] concern -- also voiced by [ORG EU  ] Ambassador [PER Bell  ] and others to the Charge -- is that [MISC Colombian  ] and [MISC Mexican  ] cartels will enter the [MISC Bolivian  ] market , expanding production and increasing trafficking-related violence. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Amid sustained domestic pressure for increases in legal production , the [ORG EU  ] has provided one million euros to fund a GOB survey of legal coca demand and other related studies ( the " [ORG Comprehensive Study  ] on the [LOC Coca Leaf  ] in [LOC Bolivia  ] " ) . 
Ambassador [PER Bell  ] explained that the full results of the legal demand survey will not be available before July 2010 , although the GOB may attempt to revise its legislation governing legal production ( including an increase from the current 12,000 hectares authorized ) before then . 
[PER Bell  ] suggested that any estimate of 20,000 hectares or less should prove useful in pressing the GOB to cut coca cultivation . 
Separately , [LOC UK  ] Ambassador Baker voiced disappointment that the study will not be ready until next summer , but stressed that the international community should not wait until then to press the [MISC Bolivians  ] on this issue. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG EU  ] officials acknowledge that their counter-narcotics assistance is small scale compared to the aid the [LOC U.S.  ] has provided . 
According to their policy paper , most assistance has gone toward alternative development ( the [ORG European Commission  ] has provided nearly 50 million euros , [LOC Belgium  ] and [LOC Spain  ] several million euros each ) , with lesser amounts in equipment donations ( the [LOC U.K.  ] gave the GOB $500,000 in forensics equipment this year ; [LOC Germany  ] and [LOC Italy  ] have also provided small amounts of in-kind aid ) . 
The [LOC UK  ] , [LOC Spain  ] , [LOC Italy  ] , the [LOC Netherlands  ] and [LOC France  ] have provided limited [ORG CN  ] training to [MISC Bolivian  ] police in recent years . 
Ambassador [PER Bell  ] maintains that the [ORG EU  ] cannot be involved directly in eradication , but allowed that some eradication-related aid may be possible ( e.g. , covering ancillary costs ) . <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) More critically , Ambassador [PER Bell  ] noted , the [ORG EU  ] lacks the capability to fill the law enforcement vacuum left by [ORG DEA  ] 's expulsion , but [ORG EU  ] members states can and should be pressed to strengthen such cooperation , he said . 
The [LOC UK  ] , [MISC Spanish  ] and visiting [MISC Swedish  ] ambassadors have all acknowledged privately that the [ORG EU  ] 's limited [ORG CN  ] approach has proven insufficient and needs to be expanded to include direct support for law enforcement . 
Ambassador Baker reported that the [LOC UK  ] is currently undergoing an internal review of its regional [ORG CN  ] policy , to be completed by early December , that will include consideration of new efforts in this area . 
Additionally , the [MISC Europeans  ] indicate that they intend to step up consultation with neighboring states such as [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Paraguay  ] and [LOC Argentina  ] , which are strengthening their own cross-border counter-narcotics cooperation with the [LOC GOB.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [ORG EU  ] 's paper proposes a number of [ORG CN  ] measures for the near term , including increased funding for technical assistance ( e.g. , on money laundering and judicial support ) , expansion of alternative development aid , and creation of mechanisms to aid the GOB in evaluating both its [ORG CN  ] successes and shortcomings . 
The [ORG EU  ] working group also identified as a priority better [ORG CN  ] coordination , both internally and with other international partners . 
Ambassador Baker amplified that point , maintaining that a coordinated , united stance will be critical to overcoming [MISC Bolivian  ] President [PER Morales  ] 's apparent resistance to reversing the growth in coca cultivation . 
The [MISC Europeans  ] also see the re-opening of the [ORG UNODC  ] office in [LOC La Paz  ] ( closed for budgetary reasons ) as key to strengthened coordination . 
Ambassador [PER Bell  ] reported that the [ORG EU  ] has contributed 500,000 euros for [ORG UNODC  ] projects and office funding and asked for [LOC U.S.  ] help in pushing the [ORG UN  ] to open the office as soon as possible . 
( Note: We understand from the [ORG UN  ] that donor support will determine whether the [ORG UNODC  ] can return . 
) <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Comment: We see a welcome evolution in the [ORG EU  ] 's approach toward counter-narcotics in [LOC Bolivia  ] , as [ORG EU  ] and [ORG EU  ] member state officials evince recognition of the need to move beyond their relatively modest and narrowly-focused efforts to date . 
The [MISC Europeans  ] may be convinced that [PER Morales  ] does not want [LOC Bolivia  ] to be categorized as a narco-state , but they are also clear-eyed about GOB shortcomings ( in terms of political will , capabilities and corruption ) , and understand that the [ORG EU  ] has to shoulder a greater share of the burden in confronting these challenges . 
With policy limitations on what the [ORG EU  ] can do collectively , however , translating this recognition into concrete action will take time , as well as leadership from individual member states .
