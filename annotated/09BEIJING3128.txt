End Summary . 
Introduction ------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) A longtime Embassy contact and former close friend of [ORG Politburo Standing Committee Member  ] and Vice President [PER Xi Jinping  ] has shared with [PER PolOff  ] his first-hand knowledge of [PER Xi  ] 's family background , upbringing , early adulthood , and political career , as well as his impressions and assessments of [PER Xi  ] 's personality and political views . 
The information was acquired in multiple conversations over a two-year period 2007-2009 . 
The contact is an [MISC American  ] citizen of [MISC Chinese  ] descent who teaches political science at [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] " [MISC Fifteen-Year Relationship  ] with [PER Xi  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [PER Xi Jinping  ] were both born in 1953 and grew up in similar circumstances . 
According to the professor , they lived with other sons and daughters of [LOC China  ] 's first-generation revolutionaries in the senior leaders' compounds in [LOC Beijing  ] and were groomed to become [LOC China  ] 's ruling elite . 
The professor did not know [PER Xi  ] personally until they had both reached their late teens , when the professor began to hear about [PER Xi  ] from the professor 's best friend , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , who was later sent to the same village as [PER Xi  ] in [LOC Shaanxi  ] province during the [MISC Cultural Revolution  ] . 
( Note: According to the professor , [PER Zhou Sanhua  ] 's father was a former editor-in-chief of the [ORG People 's Liberation Army  ] ( [ORG PLA  ] ) Daily . 
) By the time the professor and [PER Xi  ] had returned separately from the countryside , they had come to know each other personally , initially through [PER Zhou Sanhua  ] 's introduction , and maintained a relationship for the next 15 years ( ca . 
1972 to 1987 ) , even though their lives and careers took markedly different paths . 
Revolutionary Fathers --------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Xi  ] 's father , [PER Xi Zhongxun  ] , was a communist guerilla leader in northwest [LOC China  ] in the 1930s , when [PER Mao  ] and the [ORG CCP  ] leaders reached [LOC Yan'an  ] at the end of the [LOC Long March  ] . 
[PER Xi Zhongxun  ] was one of the few local leaders to survive later purges , siding with the [PER Mao Zedong  ] faction and rising quickly through Party ranks to become a Vice Premier in the 1950s while still in his thirties . 
According to the professor , [PER Xi Zhongxun  ] was the youngest Vice Premier among the early generation of [ORG CCP  ] leaders . 
Despite his association with [PER Mao  ] 's group , said the professor , [PER Xi Zhongxun  ] was also " good friends " with [PER Deng Xiaoping  ] and was " actually closer to [PER Deng  ] than to [PER Mao  ] . 
" [LOC BEIJING  ] 00003128 002 OF 006 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The professor 's father was also an early revolutionary and contemporary of [PER Mao  ] , from a neighboring county to [PER Mao  ] 's in [LOC Hunan  ] province . 
The professor 's father participated in the revolution periodically but also spent time in [LOC Japan  ] and [LOC Hong Kong  ] , distinguishing himself as a labor leader . 
In 1949 , according to the professor , his father agreed to return to [LOC Beijing  ] at [PER Mao  ] 's insistence and became the [ORG PRC  ] 's first Minister of Labor and a member of the first [MISC Chinese  ] [ORG People 's Political Consultative Conference  ] ( [ORG CPPCC  ] ) Standing Committee. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Despite [ORG Communist Party  ] rhetoric regarding the creation of a " classless " society , the professor described , the pre-Cultural Revolution society and leadership compounds in which he and [PER Xi Jinping  ] grew up were , ironically , the " most precisely class-based mini-society ever constructed . 
" Everything was determined by one 's " internal party class status , " the professor asserted , including the kindergarten one attended , the place where one shopped , and the type of car one could own . 
All of these " benefits " were determined by Party rank , such as [ORG Politburo Standing Committee  ] member , Vice Minister , or [ORG Central Committee  ] member . 
One 's every action , every day , was in some way an indication of one 's " class " status , the professor stated . 
The children of this revolutionary elite were told that they , too , would someday take their rightful place in the [MISC Chinese  ] leadership . 
All of this came to an end in the [MISC Cultural Revolution  ] , the professor said , but consciousness of membership in an entitled , elite generation of future rulers has remained among most of the members of this class . 
[MISC Cultural Revolution  ] and [MISC Return  ] to [LOC Beijing  ] ----------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Both [PER Xi Zhongxun  ] and the professor 's father were purged during the [MISC Cultural Revolution  ] and spent time in prison , according to the professor . 
( Note: [PER Xi Zhongxun  ] was purged in the early 1960s , several years before the [MISC Cultural Revolution  ] began , but things got worse for him and his family once the [MISC Cultural Revolution  ] started . 
) The professor 's father was falsely accused of supporting [PER Liu Shaoqi  ] and spent most of the [MISC Cultural Revolution  ] years ( 1966-1976 ) in prison . 
Both [PER Xi Zhongxun  ] and the professor 's father were later rehabilitated when [PER Deng Xiaoping  ] returned to power . 
[PER Xi  ] was rehabilitated by [PER Deng  ] in 1978 and was appointed by [PER Deng  ] as Party Secretary in [LOC Guangdong  ] in the 1980s. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) In the early 1970s , the circle of youthful friends , including [PER Xi Jinping  ] and the professor , managed to return to [LOC Beijing  ] from the countryside . 
The professor described themselves as " fugitives " of one kind or another . 
The professor himself served prison time and spent " years on the run " due to his father 's status as a " counter-revolutionary . 
" At this time , the professor said , he knew [PER Xi  ] , but they did not spend a great deal of time together. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The professor said that he and others found dramatically different ways to " survive " the aftermath of the [MISC Cultural Revolution  ] . 
While the professor and his closest circle of friends descended into the pursuit of romantic relationships , drink , movies and [MISC Western  ] literature as a release from the hardships of the time , [PER Xi Jinping  ] , by contrast " chose to survive by becoming redder than the red . 
" ( Note: The professor commented that , in a continuation of his attempt to deal with the [MISC Cultural Revolution  ] , the professor eventually decided to " flee " [LOC China  ] and pursue graduate study -- and a new life -- in the [LOC United States  ] . 
) Unlike the professor and others who shared his [MISC Cultural Revolution  ] experience in rural villages , [PER Xi  ] turned to serious politics upon his return to [LOC Beijing  ] , joining the [ORG CCP  ] in 1974 while his father was still in prison . 
The professor and his friends were reading [MISC DeGaulle  ] and [PER Nixon  ] and " trying to catch up for lost years by having fun , " while [PER Xi  ] was reading [PER Marx  ] and laying the foundation for a career in politics . 
[PER Xi  ] even went off to join a " worker-peasant-soldier revolutionary committee " ( note: a label given provincial governing units during the [MISC Cultural Revolution  ] ) , after which the professor had presumed he would never see [PER Xi  ] again . 
It was an " open secret , " the professor said , that it was through the " worker-peasant-soldier revolutionary committee " that [PER Xi  ] got his " bachelor 's education . 
" The professor said [PER Xi  ] 's first degree was not a " real " university education , but instead a three-year degree in applied [MISC Marxism  ] . 
( Note: [PER Xi  ] 's official biography provides no information on [PER Xi  ] between his assignment to [LOC Yanchuan  ] county , [LOC Shaanxi  ] province , in 1969 , and 1975 , when , it states , he became a student at [ORG Tsinghua University  ] , graduating in 1979 . 
) Neighbors , 1977-1982 -------------------- [LOC BEIJING  ] 00003128 003 OF 006 <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) When [PER Xi  ] and the professor 's fathers were rehabilitated following the [MISC Cultural Revolution  ] , the professor said , their respective families were relocated to the " [MISC Nanshagou  ] " housing compound in western [LOC Beijing  ] , directly across from [LOC Diaoyutai  ] . 
The professor opened his [MISC Nanshagou  ] apartment door one day in 1977 and there was [PER Xi  ] , standing across the hall from him . 
The two friends lived directly across from one another and , the professor said , talked almost daily for the next five years . 
[PER Xi  ] became a [ORG PLA  ] officer " and wore his uniform every day , " while the professor became a student at [LOC Beijing  ] [PER Shifan Daxue  ] ( [ORG Beijing Normal University  ] ) . 
There were many prominent leaders in [MISC Nanshagou  ] , including [PER Wang Daohan  ] , [PER Jiang Zemin  ] 's mentor . 
[PER Jiang  ] frequently rode his bike there , and [PER Jia Qinglin  ] ( currently [ORG Politburo Standing Committee  ] member ) also had a connection to [PER Wang  ] from that time , the professor said . 
Sporadic Contact , 1982-1987 --------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) From 1982 to 1987 , the professor only saw [PER Xi  ] periodically , most memorably during a visit to [LOC Xiamen  ] in the mid-1980s , where [PER Xi  ] was serving as a local official , and in 1987 when [PER Xi  ] visited the professor in [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC D.C.  ] In [LOC Xiamen  ] , [PER Xi  ] treated the professor like royalty , but they did not spend much time together during the professor 's visit there , and [PER Xi  ] said very little of substance . 
The professor , in turn , hosted [PER Xi  ] in [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC D.C.  ] , where the professor was a graduate student . 
[PER Xi  ] 's 1987 visit to the [LOC United States  ] was the last time the two men met face to face . 
The last time the professor spoke with [PER Xi  ] was when his father , [PER Xi Zhongxun  ] , passed away several years ago , at which time the two spoke briefly over the phone when the professor called to offer his condolences . 
[PER Xi  ] was serving as the Party Secretary of [LOC Zhejiang Province  ] at the time . 
[PER Xi  ] 's Family ----------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Xi  ] was the middle child in a family of three children that included an older sister and a younger brother , all of whom were apparently from his father 's second marriage , according to the professor . 
[PER Xi  ] 's older sister , [PER Xi  ] An'an , at some point left [LOC China  ] for [LOC Canada  ] , and as far as the professor knows , still resides there . 
[PER Xi  ] An'an 's husband was in the [ORG PLA  ] , the professor said . 
[PER Xi  ] 's younger brother , [PER Xi  ] Yuanping , moved to [LOC Hong Kong  ] when it was under [MISC British  ] rule . 
The last time the professor saw [PER Xi  ] Yuanping was in the 1980s , at a time when [PER Xi  ] 's father [PER Xi Zhongxun  ] was still Party Secretary in [LOC Guangdong  ] province . 
The brother had become both obese and very wealthy , the professor said , sporting " expensive jewelry and designer clothing . 
" The professor has lost contact with him since . 
( Note: Unofficial biographies published in [LOC Hong Kong  ] claim [PER Xi  ] had other siblings as well . 
) Marriage and Divorce -------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Xi Jinping  ] 's first marriage was to [PER Ke Xiaoming  ] , the daughter of [LOC China  ] 's 1978-1983 ambassador to [LOC Great Britain  ] , [PER Ke Hua  ] . 
According to the professor , [PER Ke Xiaoming  ] was elegant and well educated . 
The couple initially lived with [PER Xi  ] 's parents in the [MISC Nanshagou  ] housing compound , but as his father 's political fortunes rose , his parents moved to a new house in " East " [LOC Beijing  ] , near the [ORG Drum Tower  ] and close to the houses of [PER Deng Xiaoping  ] and [PER Yang Shangkun  ] , leaving the young couple to themselves in the [MISC Nanshagou  ] apartment . 
The couple fought " almost every day , " the professor said , and the marriage ended when [PER Ke Xiaoming  ] returned to [LOC England  ] and [PER Xi  ] refused to go with her . 
The professor remarked that he thought [PER Xi  ] 's " distant " quality contributed to the couple 's divorce . 
He noted that he had watched [PER Xi  ] " drift " further and further from [PER Ke Xiaoming  ] , until she finally left for [LOC England  ] . 
There was , " of course , " no way that [PER Xi  ] would go with her , the professor said . 
[PER Xi  ] later married a famous [ORG PLA  ] singer . 
[PER Xi  ] 's Early Career: Single-Minded Pursuit of [LOC Power  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) According to the professor , [PER Xi  ] was always " exceptionally ambitious " and had his " eye on the prize " from the very beginning . 
Once [PER Xi  ] had returned from his education in the worker-soldier-peasant revolutionary committee , he carefully laid out a career plan that would maximize his opportunities to rise to the top levels of the Party hierarchy , first becoming a [ORG PLA  ] officer in the late 1970s and then serving in a variety of provincial leadership positions , progressively rising through the ranks . 
By 1979 , [PER Xi  ] was on the staffs of the [ORG State Council  ] and the [ORG Central Military Commission  ] ( [ORG CMC  ] ) , serving as an assistant to the [ORG CMC  ] Secretary General and later Minister of [ORG National Defense BEIJING  ] 00003128 004 OF 006 ( 1982 ) , General [PER Geng Biao  ] , a revolutionary comrade of his father 's . 
The professor said he had the impression that [PER Geng Biao  ] had helped [PER Xi Jinping  ] get the [ORG PLA  ] job , and that [PER Xi Zhongxun  ] had , in turn , given [PER Geng  ] 's daughter a position in [LOC Guangdong  ] when he was Party Secretary there. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) According to the professor , [PER Xi  ] subsequently became even more serious in plotting a career path to the top . 
By all appearances , with his father having been politically rehabilitated and rapidly regaining his power , [PER Xi Jinping  ] could have continued to rise quickly in the [ORG Central Party  ] apparatus . 
[PER Xi  ] , however , reasoned that in the long run , staying in [LOC Beijing  ] would limit his career potential . 
[PER Xi  ] told the professor that staying with [PER Geng Biao  ] would eventually shrink his power base , which would ultimately rest primarily on his father 's and [PER Geng  ] 's networks and political support . 
Moreover , in time , people would turn against him if he stayed in the [MISC Center.  ] <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) So in a calculated move to lay the basis for a future return as a [MISC Central  ] leader , [PER Xi  ] asked for a position in the countryside and , in 1982 , became a local official in [LOC Shijiazhuang  ] , the capital of [LOC Hebei  ] province . 
[PER Xi  ] later became the Deputy Party Secretary in Zhengding county , also in [LOC Hebei  ] . 
[PER Xi  ] told the professor at the time that he " would be back one day . 
" ( Note: [PER Xi  ] later served for many years in [LOC Fujian  ] province , becoming Governor in 2000 , then moving to [LOC Zhejiang  ] province in 2002 to be Party Secretary , and then to [LOC Shanghai  ] as Party Secretary in 2007 . 
He was elevated to the [ORG Politburo Standing Committee  ] at the 17th [ORG National CCP Congress  ] in October 2007 and was appointed Vice President at the [ORG National People 's Congress  ] in March 2008 . 
) <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [PER Xi  ] told the professor at the time that going to the provinces was his " only path to central power . 
" [PER Xi  ] thought it was important to know people in the [ORG Central Organization Department  ] and to keep his eyes on the Center , even as he worked his way up the ladder as a local official . 
According to the professor , [PER Xi  ] " had promotion to the Center in mind from day one . 
" [PER Xi  ] knew how to develop personal networks and work the system , first using his father 's networks and later building his own . 
[PER Xi  ] the Person ------------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) The professor offered his personal assessment -- based on their similar upbringing and his long association with [PER Xi  ] during his formative years -- of [PER Xi  ] 's personality and political views . 
Although he had not seen [PER Xi  ] in person in more than 20 years , " one cannot entirely escape one 's past , " he asserted , and " [PER Xi  ] does not want to . 
" The professor on repeated occasions painted a portrait of [PER Xi Jinping  ] as an ambitious , calculating , confident and focused person who in early adulthood demonstrated his singleness of purpose by distinguishing himself from his peers and turning his attention to politics even before the [MISC Cultural Revolution  ] had concluded . 
The professor marveled that [PER Xi  ] joined the [ORG Communist Party  ] while his father still languished in a Party prison for alleged political crimes . 
At the time , the professor and his friend [PER Zhou  ] felt " betrayed " by [PER Xi  ] 's embrace of the [ORG CCP  ] , but both realized this was one way to " survive . 
" [PER Xi  ] chose to " join the system " to get ahead . 
Although [PER Xi  ] never said so explicitly , he sent a message that , in [LOC China  ] , there was a better way forward than what the professor had chosen: namely , do not give up on the system . 
[PER Xi  ] was reserved and detached and " difficult to read , " said the professor . 
He had a " strong mind " and understood power , but " from day one , never showed his hand . 
" <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) Unlike those in the social circles the professor ran in , [PER Xi Jinping  ] could not talk about women and movies and did not drink or do drugs . 
[PER Xi  ] was considered of only average intelligence , the professor said , and not as smart as the professor 's peer group . 
Women thought [PER Xi  ] was " boring . 
" The professor never felt completely relaxed around [PER Xi  ] , who seemed extremely " driven . 
" Nevertheless , despite [PER Xi  ] 's lack of popularity in the conventional sense and his " cold and calculating " demeanor in these early years , the professor said , [PER Xi  ] was " not cold-hearted . 
" He was still considered a " good guy " in other ways . 
[PER Xi  ] was outwardly friendly , " always knew the answers " to questions , and would " always take care of you . 
" The professor surmised that [PER Xi  ] 's newfound popularity today , which the professor found surprising , must stem in part from [PER Xi  ] 's being " generous and loyal . 
" [PER Xi  ] also does not care at all about money and is not corrupt , the professor stated . 
[PER Xi  ] can afford to be incorruptible , the professor wryly noted , given that he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth . 
It is likely that [PER Xi  ] could , however , be " corrupted by power . 
" [LOC BEIJING  ] 00003128 005 OF 006 [PER Xi  ] 's Political Instincts and Biases ----------------------------------- <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) In the professor 's view , [PER Xi Jinping  ] is supremely pragmatic , a realist , driven not by ideology but by a combination of ambition and " self-protection . 
" The professor saw [PER Xi  ] 's early calculations to carefully lay out a realistic career path as an illustration of his pragmatism . 
The most permanent influences shaping [PER Xi  ] 's worldview were his princeling pedigree and formative years growing up with families of first-generation [ORG CCP  ] revolutionaries in [LOC Beijing  ] 's elite residential compounds . 
These influences were amplified by [PER Xi  ] 's decision in his early twenties to join the [ORG CCP  ] and then the [ORG PLA  ] . 
[PER Xi  ] solidified these views and values during his subsequent very successful 30-year career as a [ORG Party  ] official , the professor concluded. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) [PER Xi  ] is a true " elitist " at heart , according to the professor , and believes that rule by a dedicated and committed [ORG Communist Party  ] leadership is the key to enduring social stability and national strength , as in the ( self-perceived ) elite-dominated society of his youth , knit together by family ties , elders and male authority . 
After years of conversations with [PER Xi  ] , and having shared a common upbringing with him , the professor said , he is convinced that [PER Xi  ] has a genuine sense of " entitlement , " believing that members of his generation are the " legitimate heirs " to the revolutionary achievements of their parents and therefore " deserve to rule [LOC China  ] . 
" For this reason , the professor maintained , [PER Xi  ] could never be a " true member " of current President [PER Hu Jintao  ] 's camp , even if [PER Xi  ] did not give any indication of opposition to [PER Hu Jintao  ] now . 
[PER Xi  ] and other first-generation princelings derisively refer to people with non-Party , non-elite , commercial backgrounds like [PER Hu Jintao  ] as " shopkeepers' sons , " whose parents did not fight and die for the revolution and therefore do not deserve positions of power. <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( C ) [PER Xi  ] knows how very corrupt [LOC China  ] is and is repulsed by the all-encompassing commercialization of [MISC Chinese  ] society , with its attendant nouveau riche , official corruption , loss of values , dignity , and self-respect , and such " moral evils " as drugs and prostitution , the professor stated . 
The professor speculated that if [PER Xi  ] were to become the [ORG Party General Secretary  ] , he would likely aggressively attempt to address these evils , perhaps at the expense of the new moneyed class. <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( C ) [PER Xi  ] at one point early in his career was quite taken with [MISC Buddhist  ] mysticism , according to the professor . 
In comments [PER Xi  ] made to the professor , including during the professor 's visit to [LOC Xiamen  ] while [PER Xi  ] was serving as an official there , [PER Xi  ] displayed a fascination with [MISC Buddhist  ] martial arts , qigong , and other mystical powers said to aid health , as well as with [MISC Buddhist  ] sacred sites such as [LOC Wutaishan  ] . 
The professor said he does not know whether [PER Xi  ] was actually religious , or whether he was simply looking for a way to aid his health and well-being . 
Regardless , the professor said , he was extremely surprised by how much [PER Xi  ] knew about the subject and [PER Xi  ] 's seeming belief in supernatural forces . 
Familiarity with the [LOC West  ] and [LOC Taiwan  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( C ) Based on personal experience , the professor noted , [PER Xi  ] is very familiar with the [LOC West  ] , with a sister in [LOC Canada  ] , an ex-wife in [LOC England  ] , a brother in [LOC Hong Kong  ] , many friends overseas , and prior travel to the [LOC United States  ] . 
As far as the professor can discern , [PER Xi  ] 's family and friends have had a good experience in the [LOC West  ] . 
The professor contrasted [PER Xi  ] 's experience and attitudes toward the [LOC West  ] with those of people sent to the [LOC United States  ] by their work units , such as the nationalist and sometime anti-U.S . 
[ORG Tsinghua University  ] scholar [PER Yan Xuetong  ] . 
[PER Xi  ] was the only one of his immediate family to stay behind in [LOC China  ] , the professor noted , speculating that [PER Xi  ] knew early on that he would " not be special " outside of [LOC China.  ] <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( C ) [PER Xi  ] is favorably disposed toward the [LOC United States  ] , the professor maintained , and would want to maintain good relations with [LOC Washington  ] . 
The professor said [PER Xi  ] has " no ambition " to " confront " the [LOC United States  ] . 
During [PER Xi  ] 's visit to [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC D.C.  ] , in 1987 , he told the professor that he had no strong impressions of the [LOC United States  ] . 
Although [PER Xi  ] was not particularly impressed by the [LOC United States  ] , he had nothing bad to say about it either . 
[PER Xi  ] took a detached stance , as if observing from a distance , viewing what he saw as just a normal part of life , not strange , the professor said . 
[LOC BEIJING  ] 00003128 006 OF 006 <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( C ) [PER Xi  ] also knows [LOC Taiwan  ] and the [LOC Taiwan  ] people very well , the professor said , noting that [PER Xi  ] was in [LOC Fujian  ] province for more than twenty years . 
Attracting [LOC Taiwan  ] investment to [LOC Fujian  ] was an important part of his accomplishments as a [LOC Xiamen  ] official .
