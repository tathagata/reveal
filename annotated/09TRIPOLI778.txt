REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: After many months of delay on the part of the [MISC Libyan  ] government , [MISC Canadian  ] oil exploration firm [ORG Verenex  ] has reached a tentative sale agreement with the [MISC Libyan  ] Government 's sovereign wealth fund . 
A final agreement should be concluded by October 20 . 
After that , the shareholders of [ORG Verenex  ] will have to approve the deal , and how the largest shareholder , [ORG Vermillion Resources Ltd  ] ( at 45 per cent ) , will vote is unknown . 
[ORG Verenex  ] has been the most successful oil explorer in [LOC Libya  ] since foreign companies started returning five years ago . 
[LOC China  ] 's recent effort to purchase [ORG Verenex  ] was nixed by the [ORG Libyan National Oil Company  ] , and [MISC Libyan  ] Government interference resulted in a 30 percent drop in [ORG Verenex  ] 's sale price . 
While the [ORG Verenex  ] sale is relatively small ( approximately $ 300 million [LOC US  ] dollars ) , the [MISC Canadian  ] company 's experience is an example of [LOC Libya  ] 's worsening business environment . 
End summary . 
[ORG VERENEX SEES  ] 30 PER CENT DROP IN SALE PRICE AS RESULT OF NEW DEAL WITH [MISC LIBYAN  ] INVESTMENT AUTHORITY 2 . 
( C ) [PER Jim McFarland  ] ( strictly protect ) , CEO of [MISC Canadian  ] oil exploration firm [ORG Verenex  ] , confirmed to Econoff that the [MISC Libyan  ] sovereign wealth fund --the [ORG Libyan Investment Authority  ] ( [ORG LIA  ] ) -- would purchase [ORG Verenex Energy  ] after the [MISC Libyan  ] government did not approve a [MISC Chinese  ] company 's offer to acquire [ORG Verenex  ] . 
The [MISC Canadian  ] firm 's assets in [LOC Libya  ] have yielded the most positive exploration results since [LOC Libya  ] welcomed back international oil companies five years ago ( Ref A ) . 
The [ORG China National Petroleum Company International Ltd  ] ( [ORG CNPCI  ] ) had offered to purchase [ORG Verenex  ] in a deal estimated at 400 million [LOC U.S.  ] dollars . 
However , the proposed sale required the approval of [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG National Oil Company  ] ( [ORG NOC  ] ) under the terms of [ORG Verenex  ] 's Exploration and Production Sharing Agreement ( [ORG EPSA  ] ) with the [ORG NOC  ] , and contained a clause allowing the [ORG NOC  ] to pre-empt any bid that had been offered . 
The [ORG CNPC  ] offer would have paid [ORG Verenex  ] $ 10.00 [MISC Canadian  ] dollars ( approximately $ 9 [ORG USD  ] ) per share in a deal valued at $ 500 million [MISC Canadian  ] dollars ( 400 million [ORG USD  ] ) . 
In addition , [ORG CNPC  ] would have paid the [ORG NOC  ] a cash bonus of $ 47 million [MISC Canadian  ] dollars . 
[ORG CNPC  ] dropped its proposed offer earlier this month . 
[PER McFarland  ] 's prediction that the GOL aimed to drive down the share price by dragging out the resolution of the sale appears to have come true ( Ref B ) . 
In this latest development , the [ORG LIA  ] will only pay $ 7.09 [MISC Canadian  ] dollars ( $ 6.57 [ORG USD  ] ) per share amounting to $ 315 million [MISC Canadian  ] dollars . 
[PER McFarland  ] said the [MISC Libyans  ] had set $315 million [MISC Canadian  ] dollars as the maximum price they would pay to acquire [ORG Verenex  ] . 
In the end , the [ORG LIA  ] deal stands to be about 30 percent less than the [MISC Chinese  ] proposal , a loss that has upset some shareholders . 
THE DEAL SHOULD CONCLUDE BY OCTOBER 20 BUT SHAREHOLDERS MAY NOT AGREE 3 . 
( C ) [PER McFarland  ] said [ORG Verenex  ] had signed a Memorandum of Understanding ( [ORG MOU  ] ) with the [ORG LIA  ] and that the [ORG LIA  ] had hired [LOC UK  ] lawyers to assist with the financial and legal due diligence of the company . 
He said this work should be finished by October 20 . 
The next step will be to obtain shareholder approval . 
The views of [ORG Verenex  ] 's main shareholder , [ORG Vermillion Resources Ltd.  ] , which owns about 45 percent of [ORG Verenex  ] stock , are not known . 
However , the only other option for the shareholders would be to force the company to take its case to international arbitration . 
[PER McFarland  ] commented that arbitration , while always an option , is unlikely as it would take several years to conclude thereby dragging out the process even longer . 
WHY IS THE [MISC LIBYAN  ] INVESTMENT AUTHORITY ( [ORG LIA  ] ) BUYING [ORG VERENEX  ] ? <a id='par4' href='#par4'>Â¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [MISC Libyan  ] Government 's choice of the [ORG LIA  ] as the state-owned entity that will buy [ORG Verenex  ] is an interesting one . 
A possible buyer could have been the [ORG NOC  ] itself which already owns many oil companies , such as [ORG Sirte Oil Company  ] , [ORG Zuetina  ] , and [ORG Hrouj  ] . 
( In earlier conversations , [PER McFarland  ] had speculated that the [ORG NOC  ] subsidiary , [ORG AGOCO  ] , that originally owned [ORG Verenex  ] 's assets in Area 47 of the [LOC Ghadames Basin  ] , might be trying to get back the area now that oil had been found ) . xxxxxxxxxxxx opined that a sale directly to the [ORG LIA  ] , instead of the [ORG NOC  ] , may enable [LOC Libya  ] to more easily sell [ORG Verenex  ] to another company . 
Other industry insiders in [LOC Tripoli  ] speculate the [ORG LIA  ] will indeed turn around and sell [ORG Verenex  ] to another [ORG International Oil Company  ] ( [ORG IOC  ] ) and [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000778 002.2 OF 002 in effect , " flip it . 
" [PER McFarland  ] hinted to Econoff that this might be a possibility , saying he was not sure of the [ORG LIA  ] 's " end game " and whether they would sell the company . 
No specific buyers have yet been identified . 
The [MISC Argentine  ] Ambassador told us that [ORG LIA  ] is trying to entice an [MISC Argentine  ] company to work with [ORG LIA  ] as the operator for [ORG Verenex  ] , as [ORG LIA  ] does not have the capacity to continue operations on its own . 
5 . 
( C ) Comment: While the [ORG Verenex  ] sale to the [MISC Libyan  ] government is relatively small ( approximately $ 300 million [LOC US  ] dollars ) , the [MISC Canadian  ] company 's experience is an example of [LOC Libya  ] 's worsening business environment . 
Some energy executives have attributed the recent downward trend in the business climate to the growing confidence that has resulted from [LOC Libya  ] 's increased presence on the international stage . 
One energy executive explicitly linked [LOC Libya  ] 's toughening stand vis-`-vis the international oil companies to [LOC Libya  ] 's assumption of leadership roles in the [ORG United Nations  ] and [ORG African Union  ] , noting that [LOC Libya  ] may feel that it now has the international standing to play hardball with foreign companies .
