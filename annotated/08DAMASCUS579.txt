( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: In a visit that went largely as scripted , [MISC Lebanese  ] President [PER Sleiman  ] arrived August 13 in [LOC Damascus  ] and issued a joint press statement with President [PER Asad  ] on their decision to establish full diplomatic relations “at the ambassadorial level.” Though there were [MISC Syrian  ] concerns that a bus bombing in [LOC Tripoli  ] might have led to a postponement , the two leaders held a series of positive meetings and left their FMs with most of the follow-up work . 
At an August 14 mid-day press conference , [PER FM Salloukh  ] and [PER FM Muallim  ] explained that they and their ministerial counterparts would meet soon to implement this decision through a long list of bilateral committees . 
Beneath the calm surface , internal debate reportedly intensified among [MISC Syrian  ] policymakers over the [MISC SARG’s  ] foreign policy course and the future of key security service officials . 
End Summary ---------------------------------------- Warm Atmospherics , Visit Goes as Planned ---------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Pre-visit [MISC Syrian  ] editorials and statements waxed eloquently about the special nature of [MISC Lebanese-Syrian  ] relations and predicted success in the opening a new chapter between the two countries . 
A [ORG Presidential Palace  ] source spun the visit as a victory in preventing efforts to drive a wedge between [LOC Lebanon  ] and [LOC Syria  ] . 
Damascenes awoke to find a two-mile stretch of the [MISC Beirut-Damascus  ] highway decorated with [MISC Syrian  ] and [MISC Lebanese  ] flags , placed side-by-side atop median street lights . 
[PER FM Muallim  ] told the press that [PER Bashar  ] had instructed all [MISC Syrian  ] officials to make the visit “successful and fruitful , ” adding “it is up to both parties to decide whether they want to reopen wounds or heal them.” VP [PER Sharaa  ] , adding his deft touch to the pre-visit build-up , said [LOC Syria  ] was interested in good relations with [LOC Lebanon  ] and welcomed “any [MISC Lebanese  ] official , ” including PM [PER Siniora  ] . 
On the issue of prisoners ( “the issue of the missing” ) , [PER Sharaa  ] called for a “solution that reassures both parties ; hence , the [MISC Lebanese  ] do not complain about having any detainees in [MISC Syrian  ] prisons , and vice versa.” The closure of this file , [PER Sharaa  ] added , would mark the “real entry” into new bilateral relations. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) D/FM Miqdad’s Chief of Staff told us during a August 13 courtesy call with incoming and outgoing Charge that there had been concern regarding the possibility of a postponement in the wake of the early morning bus bombing in [LOC Tripoli  ] that killed [MISC Lebanese  ] civilians and soldiers . 
The [ORG SARG  ] quickly issued a condemnation of the attack , and the joint presidential statement reiterated this sentiment . 
FM [PER Muallim  ] and [PER Salloukh  ] issued new condemnations in their joint press conference today. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In their August 13 joint statement , [PER Sleiman  ] and [PER Asad  ] agreed on “establishing diplomatic relations between the [MISC Syrian  ] [LOC Arab Republic  ] and the [MISC Lebanese  ] [ORG Republic  ] at the ambassadorial level , ” in accordance with the [ORG UN Charter  ] and international law . 
It added , “The foreign ministers of the two countries have been tasked , beginning this day , to take the necessary measures in accordance with legislative and legal regulations in the two countries.” The text states that border issues and “missing people from both countries” were also discussed. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) According to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] the two Presidents discussed a wide range of issues for further action , including prisoner releases , border demarcation , and the broad array of economic , political , cultural and other agreements implemented by the [ORG Syrian-Lebanese Higher Council  ] ( [ORG Ref  ] A ) . 
[PER Asad  ] and [PER Sleiman  ] reportedly agreed in principle that [PER Asad  ] would visit [LOC Beirut  ] at some date in the future . 
The two leaders are trying to build confidence on a basic level by exchanging embassies and ambassadors , but both sides realize the need for political consensus within each country to move forward , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] reported . 
Having only recently arrived at a [ORG Council of Ministers  ] declaration and a vote of confidence by the Parliament , the [MISC Lebanese  ] government needed more time to discuss how to approach the relationship . 
Having the foreign ministers continue discussions was the logical step , he suggested .

( [ORG SBU  ] ) In addition to the joint [ORG Presidential  ] statement , FM [PER Salloukh  ] and [PER Muallim  ] spoke at a joint press conference about the creation of several working committees to implement the establishment of diplomatic relations . 
Asked about Secretary Rice’s positive characterization of the resumption of diplomatic relations between [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Lebanon  ] , [PER Muallim  ] replied , “This issue was merely a result of bilateral will . 
If others find it positive , we welcome this.” Follow up actions announced by the FMs include: -- a commitment by both sides to reactivate joint committees on border demarcation “according to the priorities agreed by both sides.” ( [PER Note: Muallim  ] stressed , and [PER Salloukh  ] supported , the necessity of ending [MISC Israel’s  ] occupation of the [LOC Golan  ] , [LOC Shebaa  ] farms , [LOC Gajar  ] , and [ORG Kfar Shuba  ] . 
) -- a commitment to control borders , combat smuggling , and coordinate more closely on border administration. -- agreement to reactivate joint committees on “missing citizens” in both countries. -- agreement to reactivate commercial relations and to create a “common market.” -- agreement to review bilateral agreements “objectively.” --------------------------------------- Report of Mounting Tensions Inside [ORG SARG  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) According to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , General [PER Mohamad Sulayman’s  ] assassination remains a frequent source of controversy in internal [ORG SARG  ] deliberations . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] confided that tempers flared during an August 12 Higher [ORG Policy Council  ] meeting when high level security service officials openly questioned the government’s continuation of indirect negotiations with [LOC Israel  ] and its “generosity” with [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
The spark that reportedly set off this discussion was FM Muallim’s presentation on potential deliverables that would strengthen President [PER Sleiman’s hand  ] , to include release of [MISC Lebanese  ] prisoners . 
The security service chiefs claimed that [LOC Syria  ] would make concessions and not receive any tangible gains from engaging [LOC Lebanon  ] or talking indirectly to [LOC Israel.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Underlying this tense exchange was frustration within the security services that the [ORG SARG  ] was all but ignoring the assassination of [PER Sulayman  ] ( ref B ) , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted . 
Security service officials were suggesting that “if the [MISC Israelis  ] did it” ( i.e. , killed [PER Sulayman  ] , why was the [ORG SARG  ] continuing the dialogue ? 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] added , “And if it was an inside job , people are wondering about their future.” [PER Bashar  ] was thus under increasing pressure to provide assurances to his security chiefs about their positions and about the [MISC SARG’s  ] intention not to make premature concessions , such as public deliverables that would strengthen [PER Sleiman’s  ] position within the [ORG GOL  ] . 
Bashar’s brother [PER Maher  ] was “somewhere in the middle” of this debate and was seeking to play consensus maker and would likely make efforts to satisfy security service chiefs that [PER Sleiman  ] visit had strengthened the regime’s prestige , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Comment: As expected , the [PER Sleiman  ] visit was long on symbolism and short on commitment to take immediate concrete actions . 
While this meeting marked a historic precedent , the absence of any public mention of agreed timelines suggests the exchange of ambassadors could be a prolonged process . 
Unless [PER Asad  ] and [PER Sleiman  ] agreed privately to expedite ministry-to-ministry talks , progress on other issues ( prisoners , borders , bilateral agreements ) is unlikely to move rapidly . 
Nonetheless , the [ORG SARG  ] will play up [PER Sleiman’s  ] visit to demonstrate that [LOC Syria  ] has met a key [MISC French  ] demand for further engagement . 
Internal SARG ripples from the [PER Sulayman  ] assassination could lead to a confrontation , but thus far the regime has contained these tensions from spilling over into the public sphere . 
The [MISC Palace’s  ] spin of the visit as a success in blocking efforts to drive a wedge between [LOC Lebanon  ] and [LOC Syria  ] suggests an attempt to satisfy hard-liners that the regime’s image has been bolstered .
