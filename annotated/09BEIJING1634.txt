End Summary . 
[MISC Chinese  ] Protests to [LOC DPRK  ] Have Had No Effect ------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In a June 16 luncheon hosted by the Charge , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] made clear that the [LOC PRC  ] viewed recent provocative actions by the [LOC DPRK  ] as having gone too far . 
He assured the Charge that [MISC Chinese  ] officials had expressed [MISC Chinese  ] displeasure to [MISC North Korean  ] counterparts and had pressed the [LOC DPRK  ] to return to the negotiation table . 
Unfortunately , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] added , those protests had had " no effect . 
" " The only country that can make progress with the [ORG North Koreans  ] is the [LOC United States  ] , " he maintained . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that , although [LOC China  ] had assured [ORG North Korean  ] leaders that the [LOC United States  ] was ready to have bilateral talks with them , the [ORG North Koreans  ] had insisted that any message from the [LOC United States  ] to the [LOC DPRK  ] should be delivered directly , not through [LOC China  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] took this as further evidence that only by having direct talks with the [LOC United States  ] would [LOC North Korea  ] return to the [MISC Six-Party Talks  ] . 
[LOC China  ] Likes a [ORG Package Approach  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told the Charge that [LOC China  ] viewed favorably the USG proposal of putting all facets of a possible [ORG Korean Peninsula  ] denuclearization agreement into one package . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] characterized [MISC Chinese  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] core interests in a nuclear free [ORG Korean Peninsula  ] as " shared . 
" He reminded his hosts that Punggye , the site of the [LOC DPRK  ] nuclear test , was near the [MISC Chinese  ] border and that any accident there could have had dire consequences for [LOC Northeast China  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] insisted that [LOC China  ] was as concerned as the [LOC United States  ] about proliferation from [LOC North Korea  ] . 
The only difference in the [LOC China  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] positions , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] maintained , was " the [LOC United States  ] was the key while [LOC China  ] was only in a position to apply a little oil to the lock . 
" Building Trust -------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] cautioned that building trust between the [LOC DPRK  ] and the [LOC United States  ] would be difficult . 
In [LOC North Korea  ] 's view , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] explained , the destruction of its nuclear capability was an irreversible step while decisions by the [LOC United States  ] could be easily reversed . 
When [PER CGs Donovan  ] and [PER Goldberg  ] both pointed out that trust was a two-way street and that [LOC North Korea  ] had not evinced a great deal of it , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was evasive . 
When pressed whether he believed the [LOC DPRK  ] had been reprocessing highly enriched uranium ( [ORG HEU  ] ) , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said yes , adding that [MISC Chinese  ] experts believed the enrichment was only in its initial phases and that any [LOC DPRK  ] [ORG HEU  ] program would not be " very useful . 
" Domestic Concerns in [LOC North Korea  ] Influence Talks --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] suggested that domestic politics in [LOC North Korea  ] were in a large way responsible for [LOC Pyongyang  ] 's recent actions . 
He was dismissive of [LOC DPRK  ] justifications for the nuclear test as a response to the [ORG UN Security Council BEIJING  ] 00001634 002 OF 002 Presidential Statement critical of [LOC North Korea  ] 's April 5 Taepo-Dong 2 launch . 
" [PER Kim Jong-il  ] was obviously planning the nuclear test at the same time as the missile launch so his justification for the test makes no sense , " [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] opined that the rapid pace of provocative actions in [LOC North Korea  ] was due to [PER Kim Jong-il  ] 's declining health and might be part of a gambit under which [PER Kim Jong-il  ] would escalate tensions with the [LOC United States  ] so that his successor , presumably [PER Kim Jong-un  ] , could then step in and ease those tensions. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told the Charge that he kept abreast of [MISC Western  ] media reports about [LOC North Korea  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] cautioned that [LOC U.S.  ] experts should not assume [LOC North Korea  ] would implode after [PER Kim Jong-il  ] 's death . 
He said that [LOC PRC  ] analysts concluded that the regime would still function normally and discounted strongly any suggestion that the system would collapse once [PER Kim Jong-il  ] disappeared . 
ROK has no new ideas - [LOC Japan  ] can only scuttle talks --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that ROK [MISC Six-Party  ] Talks envoy [PER Wi Sung-lac  ] had met with [ORG VFM Wu Dawei  ] on June 9 but had offered nothing new . 
" The [MISC South Koreans  ] have plenty of ideas , but we 've heard them all before , " he complained , adding that the ROK government was too close to the situation in [LOC North Korea  ] to be objective . 
Turning to [LOC Japan  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that [LOC Japan  ] 's obsession with the abductee issue reminded him of a [MISC Chinese  ] expression for an individual who was too weak to make something work , yet strong enough to destroy it .
