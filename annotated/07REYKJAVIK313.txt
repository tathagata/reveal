( C ) SUMMARY: [LOC Iceland  ] 's Minister for [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] told the press on October 27 that an internal ministry review had confirmed that aircraft linked to [ORG CIA  ] rendition operations had transited [LOC Iceland  ] on a number of occasions since 2001 , including as recently as July 2007 . 
The Minister noted that it was impossible to determine whether such flights had carried detainees when landing in [LOC Iceland  ] or entering the country 's airspace , and said that in the future she wants closer inspection or searches of aircraft " known " to be linked to [ORG CIA  ] operations should they land in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
The opposition leader argues that the MFA should apologize for [LOC Iceland  ] 's " responsibility " in the matter , while muddling the question of blanket [ORG NATO  ] overflight clearances for military aircraft and the rendition flight issue . 
The rest of the government has kept silent on the issue , though [ORG Post  ] expects the Prime Minister to be forced to comment in the coming days . 
[ORG Post  ] believes the [ORG FM  ] 's intent is to mollify those skeptical of [LOC U.S.  ] actions while also -- by raising the possibility of boarding and search operations -- signaling that she wishes to avoid any incidents that could irreparably damage the bilateral relationship . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) [MISC Icelandic  ] Foreign Minister [PER Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir  ] reported in a radio interview on October 27 that aircraft suspected of operating [ORG CIA  ] rendition flights had transited [LOC Iceland  ] " a number of times " from September 2001 on , including one case as recent as July of this year . 
She cautioned , however , that it is not possible to determine whether or not there were prisoners on board any of the flights in question . 
The [ORG FM  ] 's comments are the result of an internal ministry review she ordered in the wake of [MISC Swiss  ] Parliamentarian [PER Dick Marty  ] 's most recent report on alleged rendition flights earlier this summer ( reftel ) . 
[PER Gisladottir  ] added that she would like the Government of [LOC Iceland  ] to look into options for closer scrutiny of future flights by [MISC CIA-linked  ] aircraft , including onboard searches by border police and customs officers . 
In comments reported by leading daily Morgunbladid on October 29 , the [ORG FM  ] added that it would be " very grave if prisoners have been moved through [MISC Icelandic  ] airspace for the purpose of torture , as this would be inconsistent with international law and [LOC Iceland  ] 's obligations . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) In response to the [ORG FM  ] 's statements , [ORG Left-Green  ] party leader [PER Steingrimur Sigfusson  ] was quick to demand that [PER Gisladottir  ] apologize for the [MISC Icelandic  ] government 's " responsibility " in the matter . 
In so doing , [PER Sigfusson  ] referred to an October 2001 meeting of the [ORG North Atlantic Council  ] in which [ORG NATO  ] allies agreed to invoke [ORG Article  ] 5 of the [ORG North Atlantic Treaty  ] . 
[PER Sigfusson  ] , pointing to this decision as having " authorized " rendition flights , garbled the distinction between the military operations specified by the [ORG NAC  ] and the civilian aircraft described in the [PER Marty  ] report as well as the [MISC Icelandic  ] MFA 's findings . 
This is an all-too-common mistake in commentary here on the matter , though state radio , in a follow-up piece on October 28 , gave the first clear explanation of military and civilian overflight and landing permissions in the press in recent memory. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Public reaction has otherwise been muted , with no other politicians commenting on the topic and no other media outlets reporting on the issue . 
However , Prime Minister [PER Haarde  ] has been out of the country for most of the last week , leaving open the possibility of further questions upon his return . 
Additionally , [ORG FM  ] [PER Gisladottir  ] will present the annual [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] report to the [ORG Althingi  ] ( parliament ) on November 8 , posing another opportunity for discussion on the matter. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Comment: The Foreign Minister 's intent is fairly clear: she is trying to satisfy those in her party and elsewhere deeply opposed to any perception of [MISC Icelandic  ] involvement in prisoner transfers , while sending an unambiguous message that this new government intends to challenge any future suspect flights. van Voorst</pre></code>
