End Summary . 
The [ORG LHC Steps Intervenes  ] in [ORG Beradar Case  ] ----------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The [ORG Lahore High Court  ] ( [ORG LHC  ] ) on February 26 reportedly issued an order barring the extradition of [PER Mullah Beradar  ] and four other individuals named in a February 25 petition brought forward by [PER Khalid Khawaja  ] challenging their detention . 
[PER Khawaja  ] , the Chief Coordinator of the [ORG Defense Human Rights Commission  ] , filed a petition dated February 25 in the [ORG LHC  ] calling on the Government of [LOC Pakistan  ] to treat the detained [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Taliban  ] &in accordance with law in the interest of justice , equity and conscience8 and asks that it refuse any transfer of the individuals named in the petition . 
[PER Khawaja  ] heavily cited various media reports about Beradar’s capture as evidence supporting his petition . 
( Note: [PER Khawaja  ] is currently defending the five [MISC Americans  ] arrested in [LOC Sargodha  ] and is known to be a pro-extremist activist and lawyer . 
End Note ) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) [PER Khawaja  ] claims that the detention of the [ORG Taliban  ] [MISC Afghan  ] in [MISC Pakistani  ] custody is against the law , violating [ORG Article  ] 4 , 10 , and 11 of the [LOC Constitution  ] . 
He argues that the individuals have not been brought before any court , that they have not been provided with the grounds for their arrest , and that they have not had access to counsel of their choice . 
[PER Khawaja  ] further charges that the &raid by the [LOC US  ] agencies and investigation by them is against the provisions of the [LOC Constitution  ] and humiliation of the sovereignty of the state.8 <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) In the petition , [PER Khawaja  ] asks the [ORG LHC  ] to “restrain” the [MISC GOP  ] from &handing over or escorting the detenus/accused...to [LOC America  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] or any other country as they are to be tried , if need be , under law of the land.8 [PER Khawaja  ] further pleads that the detainees be produced before the courts , that any investigation of the detainees should be done independently of the &FBI or any other foreign intelligence agency , 8 that the [ORG FBI  ] and other [MISC American  ] officials be restrained from interfering in [MISC Pakistan’s  ] affairs , and that the grounds for the arrest of the individuals in question be produced . 
No [MISC GOP  ] Assurances at Tripartite of [ORG Beradar Transfer  ] --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [PER Beradar  ] arrest was raised at a February 24 tripartite meeting of [ORG FBI  ] Director [PER Robert Mueller  ] , Minister [PER Rehman Malik  ] of the [ORG Pakistan Ministry of Interior  ] , and Minister [PER Atmar Hanif  ] of the [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] in [LOC Islamabad  ] . 
There was no agreement from either side about the transfer of “wanted persons.” <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In the meeting , [PER Malik  ] provided a list of [MISC Pakistan’s Most Wanted  ] to [PER Atmar  ] , and requested the same from [PER Atmar  ] . 
[PER Malik  ] named one of the [MISC Most Wanted  ] , known [MISC Baloch  ] separatist [PER Bramdagh Bugti  ] , and asked [PER Atmar  ] to assist in locating the individual and returning him to [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[PER Malik  ] also stated [LOC ISLAMABAD  ] 00000461 002.2 OF 003 that both countries had expressed interest in passing prisoner lists naming the nationals of one country being detained by the other country . 
[PER Atmar  ] said his government did not know where the [MISC Baloch  ] separatists were located and would need more information from the [MISC GOP  ] to find them. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Atmar  ] highlighted that three [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Taliban  ] leaders , including [PER Mullah Beradar  ] , had been recently detained in [LOC Pakistan  ] and advised that [LOC Afghanistan  ] would be interested in developing a dialogue to have these three deported . 
[PER Malik  ] noted that these detainees currently were not pending in the courts , but the he would seek additional information on the matter . 
[PER Atmar  ] further advised that pursuant to discussions between [LOC Pakistan  ] ISI and [MISC Afghan  ] NDS , 38 [MISC Afghans  ] were to be deported/repatriated in the near future , but these [MISC Afghans  ] had not been sent back to [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The two ministers agreed that , in regards to prisoners , the countries needed to draft an agreement to exchange prisoners . 
[PER Malik  ] agreed to provide a prisoner list to [PER Atmar  ] listing the 38 3 . 
In regards to the [MISC Most Wanted Lists  ] , the ministers agreed to share intelligence at the upcoming [MISC Focal Point  ] meeting on the “Most [PER Wanted.” Atmar  ] invited the [ORG FBI  ] to participate in these discussions and work with both countries on the efforts to locate the “Most [MISC Wanted”  ] persons . 
Director [PER Mueller  ] accepted the invitation and pledged the FBI’s full support. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Director [PER Mueller  ] strongly suggested that , as the two countries moved forward , the “prisoner” and “Most [MISC Wanted”  ] lists should not be made public . 
He urged both Minister [PER Atmar  ] and Minister [PER Malik  ] to restrain from comments to the press ( advice which was apparently ignored ) . 
The names on the lists could be key to sensitive investigations and making the names public might jeopardize investigations , the [ORG FBI  ] Director explained . 
[PER Malik  ] Denies [ORG GOP Agreement to Transfer Beradar  ] --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Given all the confusing press reporting , Ambassador contacted Minster [PER Rehman Malik  ] in [LOC Dubai  ] on February 26 to ask if there was anything conveyed to the [MISC Afghans  ] about deporting [ORG Taliban  ] , apart from the discussion in the trilateral meeting in which she , Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] and many others had participated . 
[PER Malik  ] firmly denied that there had been any agreement to extradite or deport [PER Mullah Beradar  ] or any of the other [ORG Taliban  ] leaders. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Malik  ] claimed [PER Atmar  ] had jumped the gun to the press with his suggestion that some agreement had been reached . 
[PER Malik  ] said he had told the press that [LOC Pakistan  ] would consider a request to deport [PER Beradar  ] and the others if they in fact received such a request . 
[PER Malik  ] said [LOC Pakistan  ] had its “own procedures to follow” and they had to be “sure [PER Beradar  ] hadn’t committed any crimes in [MISC Pakistan.”  ] [PER Malik  ] said he had talked to General [PER Pasha  ] ( Ambassador pressed him on this point ) , and [PER Malik  ] claimed he would not have failed to “coordinate” with everyone in his government. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Ambassador asked Interior Secretary ( Deputy Minister ) , [PER Qamar Zaman  ] , the same question on February 26 . 
He was fairly certain that the only exchange on this issue was the one conducted in the February 24 tripartite meeting . 
He speculated that Minister [PER Atmar  ] might have been under pressure from his local press to put a positive spin on the meeting. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Comment: The tripartite meeting was a follow up to the earlier May 2009 meeting in [LOC Washington  ] . 
It made progress on a number of fronts , which will be reported septel . 
But the issue of “wanted persons” dominated the press play after the meeting . 
[PER Rehman Malik  ] was at pains to convince us that no deal had been made with the [MISC Afghans.  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Comment Cont’d: As most of our readers know , the presence of [MISC Baloch  ] separatists [PER Bramdagh Bugti  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] has long been a neuralgic one with the [MISC GOP  ] , particularly with the [MISC GOP  ] military . 
Accordingly , post believes [ORG Øthat  ] we should watch out for consideration of some type of exchange of Berader with [PER Bugti  ] . 
But we do not believe that the [MISC Pakistani  ] [LOC ISLAMABAD  ] 00000461 003.2 OF 003 government , especially those who control Berader’s fate--Kayani and Pasha--would willingly lose control of such a huge potential propaganda pawn in [PER Beradar  ] . 
While [PER Bugti  ] may be a core issue at some political level , the “truths” Berader could tell about ISI , not to mention a host of other [MISC Pakistani  ] notables , likely outweigh any potential wins in bringing [PER Bugti  ] to [MISC Pakistani  ] justice. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Comment Cont’d: To state the obvious , the consistent press leaks in the media about [MISC American  ] intelligence operations in the [LOC U.S.  ] have lots of unexpected consequences . 
Most obviously , press leaks enabled the highly unpredictable and anti-American [ORG Lahore High Court  ] to issue a judgment decrying the presence of [LOC U.S.  ] intelligence agents in the Berader case .
