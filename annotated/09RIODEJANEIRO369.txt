ELECTION YEAR MAKING FOR A " HARD BATTLE " FOR INDUSTRY <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Although major international and independent oil companies ( [ORG IOCs  ] ) continue to view the regulatory framework to develop [LOC Brazil  ] 's offshore [MISC Pre-salt  ] oil and gas reserves as potentially debilitating to their future exploration and production ( E&P ) operations here , the [ORG Rio de  ] [MISC Janeiro-based  ] industry group that represents these companies has thus far been unsuccessful in efforts to enact changes to the law in the [ORG House of Deputies  ] . 
[PER Patricia Pradal  ] , head of government relations for [MISC Chevron  ] told [PER Econoff  ] on November 19 that since President [PER Lula  ] announced the framework on August 31 , industry had been fighting a " hard battle " to enact changes to the legislation , but the [ORG House of Deputies  ] has not taken any industry concerns into consideration . 
( [PER Note: Pradal  ] also heads the steering committee of the [MISC Brazilian  ] Institute for Petroleum ( [ORG IBP  ] ) , the industry umbrella group that represents all major international and independent oil companies operating in [LOC Brazil  ] , including [ORG Petrobras  ] . 
She spoke to [PER Econoff  ] in this capacity . 
E nd Note ) . 
[PER Pradal  ] lamented the lack of support from opposition parties in [ORG Congress  ] , blaming Presidential and [ORG Congressional  ] elections next year and explaining , " The [ORG PSDB  ] [ primary opposition party ] simply has not shown up to this debate . 
" She expressed begrudging respect to President [PER Lula  ] 's International Relations Adviser [PER Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] and Press Secretary [PER Franklin Martins  ] as the principal orchestrators of the Government 's strategy , stating , " They are the professionals , and we are the amateurs . 
" PSDB'S [PER SERRA  ] REPORTEDLY OPPOSES FRAMEWORK , BUT NO SENSE OF URGENCY <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) According to [ORG IBP  ] 's [PER Pradal  ] , likely [ORG PSDB  ] 2010 Presidential Candidate [PER Jose Serra  ] opposed the framework , but seemed to lack a sense of urgency on the issue . 
She quoted him as telling industry representatives , " Let those guys [ Worker 's Party ] do what they want . 
There will be no bid rounds , and then we will show everyone that the old model worked...And we will change it back . 
" As for what would happen to foreign o il companies in the meantime , [PER Serra  ] reportedly remarked , " You will come and go . 
" [ORG Congressional  ] sources have also told [MISC Embassy  ] officers that [PER Serra  ] has signaled [ORG PSDB  ] and other opposition sources that they should amend - but not oppose the final [MISC Pre-Salt  ] legislation , and urged opposition legislators to avoid vocal opposition to the law . 
CURRENT STATUS OF THE FRAMEWORK <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) On August 31 , President [PER Lula  ] announced the framework and sent it to [ORG Congress  ] for approval . 
On November 18 , the [ORG House of Deputies  ] ( [PER Camara  ] ) passed the first of the four bills ( reftel A ) that make up the framework , by a vote of 250 to 67 , to create [LOC Petrosal  ] , a new government entity that will represent the [MISC Brazilian  ] government in the not-yet-approved production sharing regime . 
Further reporting will be reported septel . 
( [PER Note:  ] The next bill to likely go to vote in the [ORG House of Deputies  ] will be the creation of a social fund , followed by the 50 billion USD [ORG Petrobras  ] capitalization bill . 
We anticipate the bill inst ituting Production Sharing Agreements ( [ORG PSA  ] ) - and making [ORG Petrobras  ] the chief operator of all [MISC Pre-salt  ] blocks - will be the last to go before a [ORG House of Deputies  ] vote . 
Once the [ORG House of Deputies  ] passes a bill , it must then go before the [ORG Senate  ] for approval . 
If the [ORG Senate  ] passes the bill , it is final . 
If it amends the [ORG Qll  ] , it will then go back to the [ORG House of Deputies  ] for discussion and revote . 
Post will report further on legislative developments septel .

PETROSAL: ALL THE CONTROL , NONE OF THE LIABILITY ? <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) While not opposed per se to the existence of [LOC Petrosal  ] , industry is concerned this group of political appointees , who will administer the [MISC Pre-salt  ] blocks on behalf of the [MISC Brazilian  ] government , will also wield disproportionate power over the operations of any Production Sharing consortium into which an oil company enters . 
Under the law as proposed , [LOC Petrosal  ] controls 50 percent of the seats - with veto power - in a [ORG PSA  ] consortia 's operating committee . 
According t o [ORG IBP  ] 's [PER Pradal  ] , this will therefore give [LOC Petrosal  ] significant power over key E&P decisions , such as budget , environmental , and safety matters , in the [MISC Pre-salt  ] blocks . 
" They will have all the control , and none of the liability , " she said . 
[ORG PETROBRAS  ] AS CHIEF OPERATOR UNIVERSALLY CRITICIZED <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Industry continues to argue the most detrimental aspect of the framework on the commercial viability of future [MISC Pre-salt  ] operations is Petrobras' designation as chief operator , part of the bill addressing [MISC PSAs  ] . 
Emphasizing a point she made to the Charge d'Affaires on September 1 ( reftel B ) , [ORG Exxon  ] 's [PER Lacerda  ] said having [ORG Petrobras  ] run all [MISC Pre-salt  ] blocks will effectively relegate oil companies to mere financing bodies . 
[PER Robert Abib  ] of [ORG Anadarko  ] said on November 19 that Petrobras' role as chief operator could shut out the smaller independent oil companies if the parastatal focuses on the [MISC Pre-salt  ] 's largest fields , rather than smaller ones where independents normally specialize and focus their operations . 
[ORG Exxon  ] 's [PER Lacerda  ] complained the [ORG PSA  ] bill failed to sufficiently define the fiscal terms assigned to the contracts , and said under the proposed regime , such terms would only become clear immediately prior to a bid round , making it nearly impossible for a company to effectively prepare . 
Both [ORG IBP  ] 's [PER Pradal  ] and [PER Lacerda  ] said ongoing debate on the distribution of royalties to oil producing and non-producing states , municipalities , and the federal government , which is also part of the [ORG PSA  ] bill , was preventing any real discussion on the framework 's transparency and ability to attract investment. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Should Petrobras' chief operator designation remain , [ORG IBP  ] 's [PER Pradal  ] said it would be impossible to compete in bid rounds against [ORG National Oil Companies  ] ( [ORG NOC  ] ) , such as [LOC China  ] 's [ORG Sinopec  ] and [LOC Russia  ] 's [ORG Gazprom  ] . 
According to [PER Pradal  ] , it will come down to who gives the government the most profit . 
" The [MISC Chinese  ] can outbid everybody , " she explained . 
" They can break-even and it will still be attractive to them . 
They just want the oil . 
" [PER Pradal  ] said [ORG Chevron  ] would not even bid under such circumstances . 
( [PER Note: Foreshadowing  ] greater [ORG NOC  ] involvement in [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Colombia  ] 's 90 percent state-owned oil company [ORG Ecopetrol  ] opened an office in [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] on November 18 . 
Furthermore , [ORG Petrobras  ] CFO [PER Barbassa  ] said on November 23 that the parastatal would be sending top executives to [LOC China  ] in early 2010 , in an effort to attract [MISC Chinese  ] petroleum equipment suppliers to [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Post will report on both issues septel . 
End Note ) . 
WHAT ABOUT THE LOCAL MANUFACTURERS ? <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [MISC Brazilian  ] manufacturers and suppliers also stand to lose from Petrobras' role as chief operator , but [LOC Brazil  ] 's largest petroleum suppliers group complained the political nature of the framework was impeding their voice on the matter in [ORG Congress  ] . 
[ORG Exxon  ] 's [PER Lacerda  ] said local manufacturers and suppliers would stand to lose by having only one principal client , suggesting the [ORG National Organization  ] for the [ORG Petrol eum Industry  ] ( [ORG ONIP  ] ) , a nonprofit forum that brings together [LOC Brazil  ] 's largest petroleum service providers and suppliers , could be a powerful ally in this fight . 
She complained , however , that [ORG ONIP  ] had thus far been " quiet " on the issue . 
[ORG ONIP  ] Director [PER Alfredo Renault  ] told [PER Econoff  ] on November 23 that while [ORG ONIP  ] does not engage on public policy or lobbying , it was concerned about Petrobras' designation of chief operator in the framework , and expressed these worries to [ORG Congress  ] . 
Unfortunately , he explained , the [ORG Special Committee  ] in the [ORG House of Deputies  ] where [PER Renault  ] made his presentation was driven by " politics rather than logic , " and appeared indifferent to his concerns . 
According to [PER Renault  ] , having only one client would not benefit [MISC Brazilian  ] manufacturers' competitiveness nor provide them with the opportunity to establish the buyer-supplier relationships with major international and independent oil companies , crucial to doing business overseas . 
[PER Renault  ] stated some industry asso ciations within [ORG ONIP  ] favored the framework , but said these groups tended to include companies that already have extensive commercial relationships with [ORG Petrobras  ] . 
RISKY [ORG PETROBRAS  ] CAPITALIZATION <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Oil company representatives see legal problems with the bill concerning the capitalization of [ORG Petrobras  ] through a guarantee of 5 billion barrels of [MISC Pre-salt  ] oil , and question the constitutionality of the transaction . 
[ORG IBP  ] 's [PER Pradal  ] explained the proposed capitalization , which will infuse [ORG Petrobras  ] with promised reserves in exchange for increased government shares in the company , has precedent in other countries ; she said , however , such precedent involved proven reserves , rather than unproven ones , as they are in this case ( [PER Note: Pradal  ] was unable to name the country where this occurred , but stated [ORG Chevron  ] 's legal team was researching the precedent . 
End Note ) . 
[ORG Anadarko  ] 's [PER Abib  ] emphasized the risk of diluting Petrobras' shareholder value , and said the company was risking a breach of its fiduciary responsibilities . 
Claiming it was impossible to accurately value the [MISC Pre-Salt  ] oil , he claimed [ORG Petrobras  ] shareholders could sue the company , if it turns out the reserves were over-valued . 
According to [PER Pradal  ] , accounting firms and investment banks held serious concerns over the transaction , but only one group of minority shareholders was vocally expressing these worries . 
She expressed consternation that the [PER CVM  ] had not even opened an investigation into the transaction . 
( Note: [ORG CVM  ] is the [MISC Brazilian  ] equivalent of the [ORG SEC  ] . 
End Note ) . 
[PER Pradal  ] added , " As a matter of fact , we do not believe [ORG Petrobras  ] is doing things by the books , " claiming [ORG Petrobras  ] willfully overestimated the 5-8 billion barrels of oil deposits in the [MISC Tupi  ] offshore area . 
( [ORG Note: Petrobras  ] is currently under [ORG Congressional  ] investigation for fraudulent practices - tax evasion , overpaying for goods , and favorable donations to [PER Lula  ] supporters - but is widely expected to be cleared of charges by a [ORG Senate  ] comm ittee controlled by the governing coalition . 
End Note ) . 
INTERNAL CONFLICT IN [ORG PETROBRAS  ] ? <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Petroleum industry players in [LOC Rio  ] claim there is a division of opinion within [ORG Petrobras  ] over the framework , and how it will end up affecting both [ORG Petrobras  ] and the [MISC Pre-salt  ] 's overall development . 
Industry insiders claim some key [ORG Petrobras  ] personnel oppose the shift to [ORG PSAs  ] and the chief operator role , Qile Petrobras' upper management mostly favor the framework , viewing the [MISC Pre-salt  ] reserves in zero-sum , nationalistic terms . 
For example , at a November 23 conference in [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] , [ORG Petrobras  ] CFO [PER Almir Barbassa  ] expressed concern over whether [ORG Petrobras  ] had the capacity to meet even its current commitments . 
" The pace of growth of new projects continues to increase , and I always wonder how much longer we will be able to grow at this pace , " he said . 
" Projects abound , but we are constrained by a lack of available personnel , material , and equipment . 
" [PER Fernando Jose Cunha  ] , General Directo r for [ORG Petrobras  ] for [LOC Africa  ] , [LOC Asia  ] , and [LOC Euroasia  ] told [PER Econoff  ] in August that the chief operator provision , along with the 30 percent mandatory share in every block , would " chase investors away " ( reftel C ) . 
On the other hand , [ORG Exxon  ] 's [PER Lacerda  ] said [ORG Petrobras E&P  ] Director [PER Guilherme Estrella  ] was largely responsible for the [ORG PSA  ] bill 's terms that prejudice international oil companies . 
( [PER Note: Estrella  ] has publicly compared [ORG Petrobras  ] to a national space program , in terms of nationalist ambition , and is considered close to President [PER Lula  ] . 
End Note ) . 
INDUSTRY STRATEGY: WHAT NOW ? <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) With industry resigned to the passage of the framework 's four bills in the [ORG House of Deputies  ] ( for the most part in current forms ) , its strategy going forward is to focus on the [ORG Senate  ] , which has a greater number of opposition legislators than the [ORG House of Deputies  ] . 
[PER Pradal  ] said [ORG IBP  ] would seek to enlist new partners to focus efforts , such as [MISC Brazilian  ] independent [ORG E&P  ] company [ORG OGX  ] , the [ORG Federation of I  ] ndustries of [LOC Sao Paulo State  ] ( [LOC FIESP  ] ) , the [ORG Confederation of National Industries  ] ( [ORG CNI  ] ) , and various [ORG Chambers of Commerce  ] , in order to win [ORG Senate  ] amendments concerning the [ORG Petrobras  ] chief operator role and Petrosal terms . 
She also said it would be ideal to prevent a [ORG Senate  ] vote before May , which could then push a vote back until after the October Presidential and [ORG Congressional  ] elections . 
According to [PER Pradal  ] , the " real fight " would take place in February , after [ORG Congress  ] returns from [LOC Recess  ] . 
[ORG Exxon  ] 's [PER Lacerda  ] also stated industry planned to make a " full court press " in the [ORG Senate  ] , but , not leaving anything to chance , [ORG Exxon  ] would now also branch out on its own to conduct lobbying efforts . 
[PER Pradal  ] emphasized both [ORG IBP  ] and [ORG Chevron  ] 's hopes that [PER Ambassador-designate Shannon  ] could make a significant impact in this debate , and asked [PER Econoff  ] on multiple occasions when [ORG Congressional  ] confirmation was expected . 
COMMENT <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) As they increase their efforts within this highly nationalistic deba te , the [MISC IOCs  ] will have to tread cautiously . 
Numerous [ORG Congressional  ] contacts have shared their assessments with Post that , by becoming more vocal on the subject , the [MISC IOCs  ] risk galvanizing nationalistic sentiment around the issue and damaging , rather than helping , their cause . 
At the same time , the [MISC IOCs  ] are not optimistic over their ability to force key amendments to the current framework . 
Furthermore , even if the [MISC IOCs  ] succeed in at least forcing a delay of a [ORG Senate  ] vote until after a possible - but uncertain - victory of an opposition President , there is a sense that the wait to bid on commercially attractive opportunities in the [MISC Pre-salt  ] will be long . 
Such outlooks , as well as the limited attractiveness of onshore blocks and the uncertainty of non-Pre-salt offshore frontier acreage , impede the IOCs' ability to effectively map out their local operations , and threaten their overall interest in [LOC Brazil  ] .
