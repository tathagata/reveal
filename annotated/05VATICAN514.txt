05 [LOC ROME  ] 2543 , 03 VAT 4859 ; 03 [LOC ROME  ] 5205 ; 04 VAT 3810 CLASSIFIED BY: [PER Peter Martin  ] , Political Officer , POL , STATE . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) ------- Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Recent conversations between [LOC Holy See  ] officials and [ORG USAID  ] and EB representatives visiting the [LOC Vatican  ] confirmed the cautious acceptance of biotech food by the [LOC Holy See  ] . 
[LOC Vatican  ] officials asserted that the safety and science of genetically modified foods would eventually be non-issues at the [LOC Holy See  ] . 
Preoccupation at the [LOC Vatican  ] , they said , was tied more to economic arguments , as some fear that widespread use of [ORG GMO  ] food in the developing world would subjugate its farmer population and become a form of economic imperialism simply serving to enrich multi-national corporations . 
There remains vocal opposition among some [MISC Catholic  ] laypeople and clergy to biotech food , and signs are not strong that the papacy or other [LOC Vatican  ] entities with which [ORG Post  ] has worked are ready to issue a stronger endorsement of these technologies . 
However , by focusing on the economic benefits of [ORG GMO  ] food for developing-world farmers , safeguards in place to prevent economic exploitation , and ongoing research on non-cash crops such as cassava , [ORG Post  ] will continue to engage the [LOC Holy See  ] on what we have called the " moral imperative " of biotech food . 
A [LOC Vatican  ] document on world hunger planned for drafting this fall offers another opening for our work on the issue and a chance to influence a wide segment of the population in [LOC Europe  ] and the developing world. ---------------------------- USG , [LOC Holy See  ] Officials Meet ---------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Michael Hall  ] , [ORG Biotechnology Advisor  ] for [ORG USAID  ] 's [ORG Regional Economic Development Services Office  ] in [LOC Nairobi  ] , met with Monsignor [PER James Reinert  ] of the [ORG Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace  ] ( [ORG J  ] and P ) , and [PER Jack Bobo  ] , Deputy Chief , EB/TTP/ABT/BTT , met with Fr . 
[PER Michael Osborn  ] of the [ORG Pontifical Council Cor Unum  ] , offering a chance to push the [LOC Vatican  ] on biotech issues , and an opportunity for [ORG Post  ] to analyze the current state of play on biotech in the [LOC Vatican  ] generally . 
Both meetings took place at the [LOC Vatican  ] . 
[ORG J  ] and P takes the official lead on biotech issues at the [LOC Vatican  ] , and has been quite active in recent years , often working closely with [ORG Post  ] ( 03 VAT 4859 ; 03 [LOC ROME  ] 5205 ; 04 VAT 3810 ) . 
[LOC Cor Unum  ] , the [LOC Vatican  ] 's clearinghouse for aid efforts worldwide , is another potential ally on biotech , as food aid to the developing world is a great part of its brief. ---------------------------------- Science and Safety not the Problem ---------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Discussing the climate on biotech foods at the [LOC Vatican  ] , [PER Osborn  ] assured [PER Bobo  ] that doubts about the safety and the legitimacy of the science of these technologies would not be a long-term problem in efforts to bring the [LOC Holy See  ] further along on biotech . 
He noted that the [LOC Holy See  ] did not feel that the genetic modification of plants posed any moral problem . 
[PER Osborn  ] mentioned a few clerical and other critics who had spoken out at [ORG Post  ] 's biotech conference last year co-sponsored by the [ORG Pontifical Academy of Sciences  ] ( 04 VAT 3810 ) , raising the alarm about the alleged dire effects of biotech food on health and the environment . 
" You're going to have a few people who continue to use scare tactics about the science , " [PER Osborn  ] said , " but little by little , they will cease to be a factor . 
" Within the [LOC Vatican  ] , he said , the mainstream opinion is that the science is solid . 
[PER Bobo  ] filled [PER Osborn  ] in on recent studies that backed up this view , and directed him to a recent [ORG World Health Organization  ] ( WHO ) report that found: " GM foods currently available on the international market have passed risk assessments and are not likely to , nor have been shown to , present risks for human health . 
" The report is available in [MISC English  ] , [MISC French  ] , and [MISC Spanish  ] at: http://www.who.int/foodsafety/biotech/who_stu dy/en/index.html. ------------------------- Economic Angle is Crucial ------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) According to [PER Osborn  ] , the main issue for the Church will continue to be the economic angle of biotech food . 
Many in the Church fear that these technologies are going to make developing-world farmers more dependent on others , and simply serve to enrich multi-national corporations . 
In his conversation with [PER Reinert  ] , [PER Hall  ] also acknowledged this concern , but noted that some researchers were working on crops such as cowpeas and cassava that were unlikely to make big profits , but could benefit the developing world . 
[PER Bobo  ] pointed out to [PER Osborn  ] that competition between companies and the regulatory process in individual countries provided some safeguards on these issues . 
Poloff mentioned presentations given at [ORG Post  ] 's conference showing that in several communities in various parts of the developing world , the advent of biotech crops had brought significant economic benefits for developing-world farmers . 
While seed companies had made some profits , the big losers appeared to have been multi-national pesticide companies . 
Describing several examples of his group 's projects , [PER Hall  ] assured [PER Reinert  ] that [ORG USAID  ] initiatives sought to empower [MISC Africans  ] and address their needs rather than blindly promote [LOC U.S.  ] interests. ----------------------- Opposition Still Active ----------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Post  ] notes that [MISC Catholic  ] opposition to biotech food is still active . 
Elements of the [MISC Catholic  ] population , primarily in the [MISC English-speaking  ] world , peppered the [ORG Pontifical Academy of Sciences  ] and [ORG J  ] and P with hostile emails when they moved forward on the issue in the past two years . 
The [MISC UK-based  ] anti-GMO [ORG Catholic Institute for International Relations  ] has been very active on the issue , as well , often through the influential [MISC English Catholic  ] magazine , the [ORG Tablet  ] . 
( In fact a letter from a [ORG CIIR  ] member in the July 30 [ORG Tablet  ] made questionable assertions attacking biotech . 
) [PER Reinert  ] said that many clergy , especially those working in the developing world , continued to be anti-biotech , though many seemed uninformed about the science . 
He pointed to the [LOC Philippines  ] as a country with a particularly anti-GMO [MISC Catholic  ] hierarchy , joking that the [MISC Filipino  ] Church would " go into schism " if the [LOC Vatican  ] came out any stronger for biotech food. ------------------- [MISC Comment: Next Steps  ] ------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) By word and action the [ORG Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace  ] and the [ORG Pontifical Academy of Sciences  ] have established the [LOC Holy See  ] as giving at least a cautious go-ahead to bioengineered foods . 
It may be difficult to get much more in the near future . 
The pope has not shown his cards on the issue , but some feel he may have been influenced by [MISC European  ] prejudices against biotech food . 
Further , before the papal transition , [ORG J  ] and P sent a document laying out a moral/theological case for biotech food to the pope 's old curial dicastery for clearance -- the theological watchdog Congregation for the Doctrine of the [ORG Faith  ] ( [ORG CDF  ] ) . 
For whatever reason , the document never came back from [ORG CDF  ] . 
What 's more , [ORG Post  ] 's greatest ally at the [LOC Vatican  ] on the question , Cardinal [PER Renato Martino  ] of [ORG J  ] and P , may be through pushing the issue . 
A [PER Martino  ] deputy told us recently that the cardinal had cooperated with Embassy [LOC Vatican  ] on biotech over the past two years in part to compensate for his vocal disapproval of the [LOC Iraq  ] war and its aftermath -- to keep relations with the [ORG USG  ] smooth . 
According to our source , [PER Martino  ] no longer feels the need to take this approach. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Despite these less encouraging signs , opportunities exist to press the issue with the [LOC Vatican  ] , and in turn to influence a wide segment of the population in [LOC Europe  ] and the developing world . 
According to [PER Osborn  ] , [ORG Cor Unum  ] will be taking the lead this fall on the updating of a [LOC Holy See  ] document on world hunger . 
In light of recent work that has been done on the subject , including the [ORG Food and Agriculture Organization  ] of the [ORG United Nations'  ] 2003-04 State of [ORG Food and Agriculture  ] report that gave a cautious backing to the use of biotech food for the developing world , it will be difficult for the [LOC Holy See  ] to avoid the issue . 
We will continue to press the " moral imperative " of biotech , publicizing and sharing data that show the economic benefit of these technologies to farmers , and explaining the safeguards that exist to prevent economic exploitation . 
Sharing information on research on non-cash crops such as cassava will also be important to winning [LOC Vatican  ] hearts and minds .
