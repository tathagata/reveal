( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Summary: ConGenoffs  ] , accompanied by [ORG USSC  ] , [ORG USAID  ] and Embassy [LOC Tel Aviv  ] representatives , met October 12 with [MISC Palestinian  ] negotiators from the previous [ORG PA  ] government who were involved in the negotiation of the Agreement on Access and Movement ( [ORG AMA  ] ) . 
The informal meeting , the second in a series of preliminary brainstorming discussions intended to reinvigorate [ORG AMA  ] implementation efforts , focused exclusively on the [LOC Rafah  ] and [ORG Kerem Shalom  ] border crossings with [LOC Egypt  ] . 
The [MISC Palestinian  ] team pressed for [LOC Rafah  ] to be open for [MISC Gazan  ] exports into [LOC Egypt  ] ; [ORG GOI  ] signature of the Customs Protocol ; clearance of commercial cargo imports at [ORG Kerem Shalom  ] by [ORG PA  ] and [MISC Israeli  ] customs inspectors ; expansion of the categories of travelers able to use the [LOC Rafah  ] passenger crossing ; and regular access of the [MISC EU-BAM  ] monitors to the [LOC Rafah  ] crossing and of all parties to the [ORG Joint Liaison Office  ] . 
End summary . 
[LOC Rafah  ] needs to open for exports ------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Palestinians  ] , led by representatives of the [ORG PLO  ] 's Negotiations Support Unit ( [ORG NSU  ] ) and including former [ORG PA  ] Planning Minister [PER Ghassan al-Khatib  ] , raised the need for the export of goods from [LOC Gaza  ] through the [LOC Rafah  ] crossing . 
Except for a March 14 shipment of three truckloads of [MISC Palestinian  ] goods for a trade show in [LOC Cairo  ] , commercial cargo has not been exported through the [LOC Rafah  ] crossing . 
The [MISC Palestinians  ] noted [MISC Egyptian  ] President [PER Mubarak  ] 's positive comments to [ORG PA  ] President [PER Abbas  ] on the subject and stressed that the flow of commercial cargo exports would be a significant boost to the [MISC Gazan  ] economy . 
They urged the [ORG USG  ] to press [LOC Cairo  ] to send the necessary instructions to the [MISC Egyptian  ] crossing at [LOC Rafah  ] for the start of commercial exports , even if only for transit shipments through [LOC Egypt  ] to third country destinations , using the March 14 arrangement . 
Lack of signature on Customs Protocol ; no clearance of commercial cargo imports ---------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Palestinian  ] team reminded [ORG USG  ] representatives that the [ORG Kerem Shalom  ] crossing , per the [ORG AMA  ] , should be a temporary crossing for imports into [LOC Gaza  ] from [LOC Egypt  ] . 
Per the [ORG AMA  ] , after 12 months of [ORG PA  ] customs officials clearing incoming cargo at [ORG Kerem Shalom  ] under the supervision of [MISC Israeli  ] customs agents , a third party would review the [ORG PA  ] 's customs capacity and make a joint decision regarding future arrangements . 
The [MISC Palestinian  ] team noted the [ORG GOI  ] 's refusal to sign the Customs Protocol or to acknowledge via letter to the [ORG USG  ] its applicability at the [LOC Rafah  ] and [ORG Kerem Shalom  ] crossings . 
As a result , there have been no commercial imports to [LOC Gaza  ] via [ORG Kerem Shalom  ] since the [ORG AMA  ] was concluded . 
A [MISC Palestinian  ] contractor working for the [MISC European  ] Commission-funded ASYCUDA customs database implementation project said the [MISC Palestinian  ] side had submitted a proposal on how to work at the [ORG Kerem Shalom  ] crossing under the supervision of [MISC Israeli  ] customs agents but had not received a response to date from the [ORG GOI  ] . 
Though some humanitarian cargo has been cleared at [ORG Kerem Shalom  ] by [MISC Israeli  ] customs , [MISC Palestinian  ] customs agents are not present and have not received any data on the humanitarian cargo clearances , according to the contractor . 
[LOC Rafah  ] -- successful passenger crossing but want broader use -------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Palestinian  ] team noted that the [MISC EU-BAM  ] has favorably commented on the [MISC Palestinian  ] operation of the [LOC Rafah  ] passenger border crossing , the only area in which the [MISC Palestinians  ] have been given the opportunity to demonstrate their capability . 
The [MISC Palestinian  ] team raised two proposals to expand operations at [LOC Rafah:  ] ( 1 ) open the crossing to all travelers , possibly with a 48-hour notification period for non-Palestinian identity card holders , or ( 2 ) expand the categories of travelers able to use [LOC Rafah  ] to include journalists and third country nationals of [MISC Palestinian  ] heritage , who do not hold a [MISC Palestinian  ] identity card . 
( Note: Per the [ORG AMA  ] , only [MISC Palestinian  ] identity card holders and the four categories of travelers requiring 48-hour pre-notification ( diplomats , foreign representatives of recognized international organizations , investors , and humanitarian cases ) can cross at [LOC Rafah  ] . 
End note . 
) The [ORG NSU  ] advisors also highlighted the need for the [ORG GOI  ] to provide the [ORG PA  ] with complete information concerning [MISC Palestinian  ] ID holders outside of the country , as called for in the [ORG AMA  ] . 
They noted that they have examples of [MISC Palestinian  ] ID holders who are not on the original list that the [ORG GOI  ] shared with the [ORG PA  ] . 
( Note: [MISC Israeli  ] Coordinator of [ORG Government Activities  ] in the [MISC Territories  ] ( COGAT ) Major General [PER Mishlev  ] gave [ORG PA Civil Affairs  ] Minister [PER Dahlan  ] a digital copy of the [MISC Palestinian  ] population registry on November 24 , 2005 . 
The [MISC Palestinian  ] side continues to note that the registry was not complete and they are aware of specific names that are not included on the registry but should be . 
End note . 
) Access of [MISC EU-BAM  ] monitors to [LOC Rafah  ] and access by all to [ORG Joint Liaison Office  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Palestinian  ] team raised again the issue of access to the [LOC Rafah  ] crossing by the [MISC EU-BAM  ] monitors , noting that [MISC EU-BAM  ] monitors can only access [LOC Rafah  ] through the [ORG Kerem Shalom  ] crossing that the [ORG GOI  ] controls . 
Even if the [MISC EU-BAM  ] monitors accessed [LOC Rafah  ] through the [MISC Egyptian  ] side , the [MISC Palestinian  ] team noted that [MISC Israeli  ] control of the [ORG Kerem Shalom  ] crossing could prevent operations at the [ORG Joint Liaison Office  ] ( [ORG JLO  ] ) at [ORG Kerem Shalom  ] . 
EconChief raised the possibility of a back-up [ORG JLO  ] , should there be a problem with the main office at [ORG Kerem Shalom  ] . 
The [MISC Palestinian  ] team noted that there had been no discussion to date of a back-up site for the [ORG JLO  ] .
