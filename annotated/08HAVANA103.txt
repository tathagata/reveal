<code><pre>Thursday , 31 January 2008 , 19:52 [ORG C O N  ] F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 06 [ORG HAVANA  ] 000103 SIPDIS SIPDIS DEPT FOR WHA/CCA EO 12958 DECL: 01/25/2018 TAGS PGOV , PINR , PREL , [LOC ECON  ] , [LOC AMED  ] , [ORG SOCI  ] , AMGT , CU SUBJECT: [MISC CUBAN  ] HEALTHCARE: “AQUI [ORG NADA ES FACIL”  ] ( HERE NOTHING IS EASY ) REF: [ORG HAVANA  ] 0076 Classified By: COM: [PER Michael E. Parmly:  ] For reasons 1.4 b/d <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: This cable is a follow up to [LOC Reftel  ] and provides anecdotal accounts from [MISC Cubans  ] about their healthcare , based on [ORG USINT FSHP’s  ] ( [ORG Foreign Service Health Practitioner  ] ) interactions with them , her unauthorized visits to [MISC Cuban  ] hospitals , and her care of [ORG USINT American  ] and [MISC Cuban  ] personnel . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The following anecdotes were obtained from [MISC Cubans  ] of various walks of life: domestic employees , neighbors in the [LOC Havana  ] suburbs , [ORG USINT Local Contract National  ] ( [ORG LCN  ] ) employees , service providers such as manicurists , masseuses , hair stylists , chauffeurs , musicians , artists , yoga teachers , tailors , as well as HIV/AIDS and cancer patients , physicians , and foreign medical students . 
-- A [MISC Cuban  ] woman in her thirties confides , “It’s all about who you know . 
I’m okay because I am healthy and I have ‘friends’ in the medical field . 
If I didn’t have my connections , and most [MISC Cubans  ] do not , it would be horrible.” She relates that [MISC Cubans  ] are increasingly dissatisfied with their medical care . 
In addition to the general lack of supplies and medicines , and because so many doctors have been sent abroad , the neighborhood family physicians now care for 300-400 families and are overwhelmed by the workload . 
( Note: Neighborhood doctors are supposed to provide care for only 120 families . 
End Note . 
) In the absence of the physicians , patients go to their municipality’s “polyclinic , ” but long lines before dawn are common , with an all too common 30-second diagnosis of “it’s a virus.” -- A 40-year old pregnant [MISC Cuban  ] woman had a miscarriage . 
At the [MISC OB-Gyn  ] hospital they used a primitive manual vacuum to aspirate the contents of her womb , without any anesthesia or pain medicine . 
She was offered no emotional support for her ‘loss’ and no pain medication or follow up appointments . 
-- A 6-year old [MISC Cuban  ] boy with osterosarcoma ( bone cancer ) is admitted to the oncology hospital . 
Only his parents are permitted to visit , and then only for limited hours . 
He does not have a television nor any games or toys . 
The hospital offers no social support services . 
The parents do not seem informed as to their son’s case . 
When asked by the [ORG FSHP  ] what they know about the management of the disease , they shrug their shoulders . 
According to the [ORG FSHP  ] , cancer patients do not receive on-going basic care utilizing testing procedures common in much of the world to monitor cancer care -- such as blood chemistries and tumor markers , sonograms , x-rays , [LOC CT  ] and bone scans , MRIs , PET scans , etc . 
Patients are generally informed of the type of cancer they have , but know little of its staging , tumor size , metastasis , or prognosis . 
They may be offered surgery followed by chemotherapy and/or radiation but are not given choices to decide an aggressive versus less aggressive approach , nor are they allowed internet access to learn more of their disease . 
-- Many young cancer patients reportedly have become infected with [MISC Hepatitis  ] C after their surgeries . 
Contracting [MISC Hepatitis  ] C after surgery indicates a lack of proper blood screening prior to administering transfusions . 
All blood should be screened for [MISC Hepatitis  ] B , C , HIV and Syphilis prior to use . 
Patients have no recourse and are not fully informed of the seriousness of such an inadvertent infection . 
-- During chemotherapy and radiation treatments , patients receive little in the way of symptom or side-effects care ( i.e. , severe nausea , vomiting , low blood counts , fever , diarrhea , radiation burns , mouth sores , peripheral neuropathies , etc . 
) that is critically important in being able to continue treatments , let alone provide comfort to an already emotionally distraught victim . 
Cancer patients are not provided with , nor can they find locally , simple medications such as Aspirin , Tylenol , skin lotions , vitamins , etc . 
Most [MISC Cuban  ] patients are not offered [LOC Hospice Care  ] or any social support programs for children , adults , or their care providers . 
-- HIV positive patients have had the letters ‘SIDA’ ( [MISC AIDS  ] ) [ORG HAVANA  ] 00000103 002 OF 006 stamped on their national [MISC ID  ] cards . 
Needless to say , in a country where the national [MISC ID  ] card must be shown for everything from getting monthly rations to buying a train ticket , the person is stigmatized for life . 
There is no patient/doctor confidentiality and discrimination is very strong . 
( Note: According to [ORG Pan-American Health Organization  ] ( [ORG PAHO  ] ) officials in [LOC Havana  ] , stamping [MISC ID  ] cards used to be the case but is no longer the practice in [LOC Cuba  ] , something we could not independently corroborate . 
End Note . 
) -- Some newly diagnosed [MISC HIV/AIDS  ] patients are held in what has come to be known as “Prision de Pacientes con [ORG SIDA  ] de [PER San Jose”  ] ( Prison for [MISC AIDS  ] patients ) . 
There they are started on antiretrovirals AZT , D4T , 3TC . 
It is unclear to them why they were put in this prison-like facility but believe it is plain discrimination due to their homosexuality . 
The average period spent at this facility seems to be 18-24 months . 
-- [MISC AIDS  ] patients are not given prophylaxis medication for the prevention of PCP ( Pneumocysti carinii pneumonia ) , and for lack of newer medicines some patients are re-started on antiretroviral regimens that were stopped due to significant side effects . 
The [MISC Cuban  ] family physicians who care for these patients’ primary care needs do not have the authority to treat their HIV/AIDS disease . 
There is only one facility in [LOC Cuba  ] , Instituto [PER Pedro Kouri  ] , located in [LOC Havana  ] , where HIV positive patients can receive their specialty care , antiretroviral medications and treatments . 
According to HIV positive [MISC Cubans  ] known to [ORG FSHP  ] , one usually waits for months for an appointment , but can often move ahead in line by offering a gift or hard currency . 
We are told five [MISC Cuban  ] convertible pesos ( approximately USD 5.40 ) can get one an x-ray and more can get one a [MISC CD4  ] count . 
Patients on the island must travel to the capital city for their specialist visits and medication . 
Due to the lack of island-wide transportation and the cost of travel , many [MISC HIV-positive  ] patients may be seen only once per year . 
-- While the [ORG GOC  ] claims there is a network of organizations that provide social support for HIV/AIDS patients , many of our sources say they have never been to one . 
Because they are “marked” as HIV positive , many are prevented from pursuing university studies and few can find gainful employment -- many must resort to menial jobs to survive . 
-- A physician [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told the [ORG FSHP  ] that he works 14 hours every other day , then has to hitchhike home because he cannot afford to own a car . 
-- [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated that [MISC Cuban  ] authorities have banned [PER Michael Moore’s  ] documentary , “Sicko , ” as being subversive . 
Although the film’s intent is to discredit the [LOC U.S.  ] healthcare system by highlighting the excellence of the [MISC Cuban  ] system , he said the regime knows the film is a myth and does not want to risk a popular backlash by showing to [MISC Cubans  ] facilities that are clearly not available to the vast majority of them . 
When the [ORG FSHP  ] showed Sicko to a group of [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , some became so disturbed at the blatant misrepresentation of healthcare in [LOC Cuba  ] that they left the room . 
-- Even the [MISC Cuban  ] ruling elite sometimes goes outside of [LOC Cuba  ] for the best medical care . 
[PER Fidel Castro  ] , in July , 2006 brought in a [MISC Spanish  ] doctor during his health crisis . 
Vice Minister of [ORG Health Abelardo Ramirez  ] went to [LOC France  ] for gastric cancer surgery . 
The neurosurgeon who is Chief of [LOC CIMEQ Hospital  ] ( reportedly one of the best in [LOC Cuba  ] ) went to [LOC England  ] for eye surgery and returns periodically for checkups . 
-- According to a local pediatrician , the approximate breakdown of [MISC Cuban  ] physicians’ salaries are: 1st & 2nd year residences earn 325 pesos monthly ( USD 15.00 ) ; 3rd year residences earn 355 ( USD 16.00 ) ; 4th year residences ( specialists ) earn 400 pesos monthly ( USD 18.00 ) . 
For every four years of medical practice thereafter , a physician receives an additional 20 pesos ( USD 0.89 cents ) per month . 
-- There is reportedly such a shortage of nurses that within the last few years , a high-school graduate is now offered an [ORG HAVANA  ] 00000103 003 OF 006 accelerated training course of just ten-months duration entitled , “Enfermeras Emergentes” ( Emergency Nurses ) . 
These “quasi” nurses are not trained to start Intravenous lines , interpret lab results or draw blood . 
-- Few medical professionals are allowed access to the internet and are rarely allowed to travel to participate in international conferences or continuing education courses . 
Access to up-to-date medical literature is not available . 
Some physicians have confided to the [ORG FSHP  ] , “All of us want to leave.” They are dissatisfied with their salaries and their own medical care . 
They receive no special privileges - most of them do not even have access to care at the better foreigner hospitals , even if they work there . 
-- As described in reftel , the best medical institutions in [LOC Cuba  ] are reserved for foreigners with hard currency , members of the ruling elite and high-ranking military personnel . 
These institutions , with their intended patient clientele in parentheses , include: [ORG Clinica Central  ] [PER Cira Garcia  ] ( diplomats & tourists ) , [LOC Centro Internacional  ] de [ORG Investigaciones Restauracion Neurologica  ] ( foreigners & military elite ) , [ORG Centro  ] de [ORG Investigaciones Medico Quirurgicas  ] ( military & regime elite ) , [ORG Clinica  ] de Kohly ( Primer [ORG Buro Politico & Generals  ] of the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] ) , and the top floors of the [LOC Hermanos Ameijeiras Hospital  ] ( foreigners ) and [PER Frank Pais Hospital  ] ( foreigners ) . 
These institutions are hygienically qualified , and have a wide array of diagnostic equipment with a full complement of laboratories , well-stocked pharmacies , and private patient suites with cable television and bathrooms. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Below are first-hand observations from [ORG USINT’s Foreign Service Health Practitioner’s  ] ( [ORG FSHP  ] ) impromptu and unauthorized ( by the [ORG GOC  ] ) visits to major [LOC Havana  ] hospitals where average [MISC Cubans  ] receive their healthcare , and from conversations with [MISC Cubans  ] in many walks of life. <a id='parA' href='#parA'>¶</a>A . 
[LOC Hermanos Ameijeiras Hospital  ] -- Address: [PER San Lazaro  ] #701 [ORG Esquina A Belascoain  ] , [LOC Centro Habana  ] , [LOC Havana  ] -- Date of visit: October , 2007 -- Built in 1982 , this newly renovated 600 bed , 24 story hospital is depicted in [PER Michael Moore’s  ] film “Sicko , ” where some 60 surgeries are performed daily including heart , kidney , and cornea transplants , mostly to patients who receive free treatment as part of [ORG Operation Milagro  ] ( mostly from [LOC Venezuela  ] , but also from the rest of [LOC Latin America  ] ) . 
The two top floors ( shown in the movie ) are the most modern and are reserved for medical tourists and foreign diplomats who pay in hard currency . 
The hospital has three intensive care units and all medical specialties except Pediatrics and Obstetrics/Gynecology and has no emergency room . 
The facility has a [LOC CT  ] scanner ( often said to be out-of-service ) , MRI and hyperbaric chamber capabilities . 
-- Upon entering the building the [ORG FSHP  ] was struck by the grand and impressive lobby with a four-story ceiling , polished terrazzo floors and an elegant center reception booth . 
No one was in the reception booth , which displayed a digital streaming ticker-tape announcing an outdated hospital event ; 30 or 40 people were sparsely scattered in the leather-like chairs throughout the lobby . 
There were no wheel chairs or other obvious signs this was a hospital . 
-- She was told the majority of patients came from [LOC Venezuela  ] and each received weekly one bar of [LOC Palmolive bath  ] soap , [LOC Palmolive shampoo  ] , and a tube of [LOC Colgate toothpaste  ] . 
She was also told the [MISC Venezuelan  ] patients frequently take these items outside to the front parking lot and sell them to local [MISC Cubans  ] . 
[MISC Cuban  ] in-patients receive one tube of [LOC Colgate toothpaste  ] and no other toiletries . 
-- Due to the high volume of foreigners receiving treatments and surgeries , most [MISC Cubans  ] do not have access - the only chance might be a through a family member or connection working there and a gift or 20 CUCS ( USD 21.60 ) to the Hospital Administrator . 
[MISC Cubans  ] are reportedly very resentful [LOC HAVANA  ] 00000103 004 OF 006 that the best hospital in [LOC Havana  ] is “off-limits” to them. <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
[PER Ramon Gonzalez Coro Hospital  ] -- Address: Calle 21 #856 between 4th & 6th Avenues , [LOC Vedado Plaza  ] , [LOC Havana  ] -- Date of visit: July , 2006 -- What is today the [ORG Obstetrics & Gynecology  ] ( [MISC OB-Gyn  ] ) hospital for [LOC Havana  ] , used to be a private clinic prior to the revolution . 
The hospital has: 300 beds and reserves 12 beds for foreigners ; an [ORG Intensive Care Unit  ] for women as well as a [ORG Newborn Intensive Care Unit  ] ( using a very old infant ‘Bird’ respirator/ventilator - the model used in the [LOC U.S.  ] in the 1970s ) ; an [ORG Intermediate Newborn Care Unit  ] ; one room for babies less than five pounds needing weight gain ; a [ORG Genetics Department  ] with a specialized laboratory ; and five surgical suites . 
-- The [ORG FSHP  ] visited this hospital with a pregnant USINT [MISC American  ] patient . 
Normally USINT staff is required to go to [PER Cira Garcia Clinic  ] , but because there were possible OB complications the [ORG FSHP  ] was able to arrange , through a [MISC Cuban  ] medical contact , for the patient to be seen by a highly-recommended obstetrician . 
-- This hospital , located in the densely populated residential area of [LOC Vedado  ] , had a dilapidated and crumbling exterior . 
The [ORG FSHP  ] was stopped at the entrance by a guard , but upon mentioning the name of the doctor they were to see , were allowed to proceed to the second floor - supposedly the nicest part of the hospital , which is reserved for foreigners ; it reminded the [ORG FSHP  ] of some of the poorest hospitals she had seen in [LOC Africa  ] - unkempt rooms , old wrought-iron beds , flat mattresses with only one sheet , no [MISC A/C  ] , no TV , no amenities . 
At the nursing station there was no nurse , but a metal cabinet with glass doors that had one jar filled with cotton and one half-full 16 ounce bottle of isopropyl alcohol . 
There were no other supplies nor any indication this was a nurse’s station - no stethoscopes , no computers , no medical charts , no papers or pens on the desk - there was a lone dial-type black telephone . 
-- After waiting 15 minutes a nurse in a white uniform appeared and told the [ORG FSHP  ] and her patient to wait . 
She wasn’t friendly . 
There was no waiting room , so they found some chairs in the hall . 
It was very hot and the patient was very anxious and in pain . 
After 45 minutes and several attempts in a polite manner to move things along , a young female doctor came out smiling and asked for the patient - she asked that her husband remain in the chair , but did allow the [ORG FSHP  ] to go with her upon insisting . 
At the end of a long hallway , the [ORG FSHP  ] and the patient were guided into an “exam room.” There were no chairs , screens , posters , any medical supplies or equipment ; only one old rusting sheet-metal table without any covering , extensions or stirrups . 
She asked the patient to undress and climb on the table with no intention to drape her . 
Having worked in third-world countries , the [ORG FSHP  ] brought with her a bag of supplies that included paper drapes , which she placed on the table and over the patient . 
The doctor pulled out of a nearby drawer an old Pinard fetal heart stethoscope made of aluminum ( funnel-shaped , like those used at the turn of the Century ) to listen for the baby’s heart beat . 
The [ORG FSHP  ] could not believe her eyes -- this was one of the best [MISC OB/GYN  ] hospitals in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
When the [ORG FSHP  ] offered the doctor a portable fetal [PER Doppler  ] she had brought from the [ORG USINT Health Unit  ] ( [ORG HU  ] ) , she gladly accepted . 
-- Although the doctor appeared to be clinically competent , she was abrupt and rough with the patient . 
[ORG FSHP  ] believes this to be typical of the hierarchical doctor-patient relationship in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
She stated , “She has an infection and needs an antibiotic , ” and gave the [ORG FSHP  ] a written prescription for an antibiotic generally not recommended during pregnancy . 
Upon returning to the [ORG HU  ] the [ORG FSHP  ] did a culture that returned negative for a bacterial infection . 
Needless to say , the [ORG FSHP  ] did not give the prescription to the patient . 
As a result of this experience , the [ORG FSHP  ] concluded that the best care for her unstable female pregnant patients in [LOC Havana  ] -- barring a [ORG MEDEVAC  ] to the [LOC U.S.  ] -- would [LOC HAVANA  ] 00000103 005 OF 006 be by the [ORG FSHP  ] in their own home with telephone consults to an obstetrician in the [LOC U.S  ] . 
-- [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told the [ORG FSHP  ] that [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] foreign medical students are increasingly covering for the gross shortages of physicians in [MISC Cuban  ] hospitals. <a id='parC' href='#parC'>¶</a>C . 
[PER Calixto Garcia Hospital  ] -- Address: [PER Avenida De Universidad  ] Y 27 [PER De Noviembre  ] , [LOC Vedado  ] , [LOC Havana  ] -- Date of visit: November , 2007 -- Built in the late 1800’s , this dilapidated 400-bed hospital was the first teaching hospital in [LOC Cuba  ] and is only for [MISC Cubans  ] . 
[ORG FSHP  ] believes that if [PER Michael Moore  ] really wanted the “same care as local [MISC Cubans  ] , ” this is where he should have gone . 
The 22-bed emergency room receives all the major trauma and accident victims from [LOC Havana City  ] , plus there are large [ORG Intensive  ] and [ORG Intermediate Care Units  ] . 
It also has a [LOC CT  ] scanner and an [MISC MRI  ] , which are reportedly often out of order . 
The hospital provides specialist care in all medical fields except [ORG OB-Gyn  ] and Pediatrics . 
-- During the hospital visit , [ORG FSHP  ] was struck by the shabbiness of the facility -- no renovations were apparent -- and the lack of everything ( medical supplies , privacy , professional care staff ) . 
To the [ORG FSHP  ] it was reminiscent of a scene from some of the poorest countries in the world . 
-- In an open-curtained exam room inside the emergency room , [ORG FSHP  ] saw a middle-aged man lying on a gurney in his own soiled clothes with a large bloody bandage wrapped around his head - he was breathing , but was neither moving nor talking - there was no IV , oxygen ( in fact no piped-in oxygen at all at this facility ) or monitoring equipment . 
Neither did there seem to be any sense of urgency to his care . 
-- The hospital is spread out over several city blocks consisting of many two-story buildings with various specialties: Internal Medicine , [LOC Cardiology  ] , General Surgery , [ORG Orthopedics  ] , [ORG Ophthalmology  ] , and Neurology , etc . 
Each building is set up in dormitory style , with 44 metal beds in two large open rooms . 
-- The laboratory equipment is very rudimentary - a simple [ORG CBC  ] ( complete blood count ) blood test is calculated manually by a laboratory technician looking through a microscope and counting the individual leucocytes , lymphocytes , monocytes , etc . 
-- As the [ORG FSHP  ] exited a building , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] drove up in a badly dented 1981 Moskovich that belched exhaust fumes . 
The private car , which is a luxury in [LOC Cuba  ] , was a gift from his deceased father . 
He was a thin man , appearing disheveled , unshaved , with a cigarette between his lips , wearing a tattered white lab coat without a shirt underneath . 
He said his salary was 565 pesos ( approximately $22 ) per month. <a id='parD' href='#parD'>¶</a>D . 
[PER Salvador Allende Hospital  ] -- Address: [PER Calzada Del Cerro  ] # 1551 , [PER Cerro  ] , [LOC Havana  ] -- Date of visit: November , 2007 -- This 400-bed hospital is located in [PER Cerro  ] - a poorer and more densely populated section than the others visited in [LOC Havana  ] . 
It is an old , run-down facility similar in appearance to [PER Calixto Garcia Hospital  ] in that there are several two-story buildings each with a medical specialty . 
-- The [ORG FSHP  ] was dropped off a few blocks away so the guards wouldn’t see the diplomatic plates . 
When she walked in , the guards smelled of alcohol . 
In the emergency room there were about 40 mostly poor-looking [MISC Afro-Cuban  ] patients waiting to [LOC HAVANA  ] 00000103 006 OF 006 be seen . 
It appeared to be very orderly , clean , and organized . 
-- The rest of the buildings were in shambles . 
The [ORG FSHP  ] did not see any “real” medicine or nursing practiced during her almost one-hour walk through most of the buildings . 
As she saw patients , she could not help but think that their own home might provide more value-added than remaining in that hospital . 
Patients had to bring their own light bulbs if they wanted light in their rooms . 
The switch plates and knobs had been stolen from most of the rooms so one had to connect bare wires to get electricity . 
There was no [ORG A/C  ] and few patients had floor fans . 
Patients had to bring their own sheets , towels , soap and supplemental foods . 
Hospital food service consisted of rice , fish , rice , eggs , and potatoes day after day . 
No fresh fruits , vegetables , or meat were available. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Comment: After living in [LOC Cuba  ] for two and a half years , treating numerous [MISC Cuban  ] employees at [ORG USINT  ] , and interacting with many other [MISC Cubans  ] , the [ORG FSHP  ] believes many are malnourished and psychologically stressed . 
Hypertension , diabetes and asthma are widespread , but poorly treated . 
Common prescription and basic over-the-counter medications are unavailable . 
Given the large number of chronic diseases treated by the [ORG FSHP  ] , preventive medicine in [LOC Cuba  ] is a by-gone ideal , rather than the standard practice of care .
