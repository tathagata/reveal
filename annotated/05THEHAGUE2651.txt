THE [ORG HAGUE  ] 2599 Classified By: CHARGE D'AFFAIRES CHAT BLAKEMAN FOR REASONS 1.4 ( B ) AND ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: The [ORG GONL  ] is fully trying at the national and local levels to combat [MISC Islamic  ] extremism on [MISC Dutch  ] soil . 
The government 's approach involves a two-pronged effort . 
First , the [MISC Dutch  ] are promoting social integration in order to shrink the pool of potential recruits for extremist groups . 
Second , they are tackling extremists directly by reinforcing the government 's ability to investigate and prosecute terrorism and to frustrate individuals and groups that promote violent radicalism . 
Most of these programs are new , so their long-term effectiveness is hard to judge ; preliminary indications are mixed . 
Many official efforts to reach out to communities most susceptible to the extremist message have been received skeptically . 
Embassy The [ORG Hague  ] and [ORG AMCONSULATE Amsterdam  ] are actively cultivating ties with the [MISC Dutch Muslim  ] community , and have recently established a [ORG Working Group on Integration Issues  ] to coordinate outreach and reporting opportunities among all mission elements . 
END SUMMARY <a id='parI' href='#parI'>¶</a>I . 
HOST COUNTRY EFFORTS: ----------------------- NATIONAL LEVEL: -------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Although the September 11 attacks in the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [LOC Madrid  ] bombings convinced the [MISC Dutch  ] government to reexamine its counterterrorism policies ( septel ) , the murder of [MISC Dutch  ] filmmaker [PER Theo van Gogh  ] by a [MISC Dutch-born Islamic  ] Extremist in November 2004 was an equally traumatic wake-up call . 
The van [PER Gogh  ] murder , and the subsequent arrest of members of the [ORG Hofstad Group  ] , was viewed by many as proof that long-standing [MISC Dutch  ] approaches were inadequate to counter extremism within the [LOC Netherlands  ] growing and largely non-integrated [MISC Muslim  ] community ( ref b ) . 
Minister of [MISC Integration  ] [PER Rita Verdonk  ] was given primary responsibility for combat radicalism nationally , along with a 40 million [MISC Euro  ] budget for this purpose . 
On August 19 , 2005 [PER Verdonk  ] unveiled a comprehensive program entitled Empowerment and [ORG Integration Policy  ] , [ORG Prevention of Radicalization  ] from the [ORG Perspective of Integration Policy  ] . 
The plan includes 34 projects and initiatives for implementation over the next 3 years , and tasks individual ministries with carrying out specific parts of the plan . 
The programs are designed to counter radicalism from [MISC Muslim  ] extremists as well as right-wing extremists and others espousing violent ideologies . 
PRONG ONE: EMPHASIZING [ORG INTEGRATION  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The first prong of the government 's comprehensive approach is to reduce the appeal of radical ideologies , especially among youth , by promoting the concept of shared citizenship , strengthening social ties between native and non-native [MISC Dutch  ] , and encouraging vulnerable youth to remain in school . 
To this end , the [ORG Education Inspection Board  ] was tasked with establishing a national center to report incidents of discrimination and extremism in the education sector . 
The [ORG GONL  ] has also begun partnering with government-funded think tanks to empower youth and imbue them with democratic norms , strengthen social ties between minorities and native [MISC Dutch  ] , and empowering [MISC Muslim  ] circles against the influence of radicalization . 
Specific areas in which the [ORG GONL  ] has become or intends to become more active nationally include ; -Mentoring and coaching for teachers and students. -Promotion of active citizenship -Support of civil initiatives in the areas of the labor market , economic entrepreneurship , education , youth , sports , and neighborhood safety. -Measures and initiatives to remove impediments for minorities on the labor market through creation of more training and work experience placements , countering prejudice and coaching higher-educated minority youth <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The 34 specific projects listed projects fall into the following categories: -- [ORG Shared Citizenship within Democratic Rule of Law: These  ] include education projects to promote awareness of a shared past , present and future between [MISC Muslim  ] communities and native [MISC Dutch  ] , as well as programs to highlight the social benefits of ethnic diversity . 
Promoting the celebration of Day of [ORG Freedom World War II  ] remembrance day is also a priority . 
The program envisages a series of lectures and conferences on fundamentalism and radicalization , and promotes contracts and covenants between local authorities , schools , [MISC Islamic  ] organizations and mosques on moral frameworks and code of conduct . 
-- Local Approaches to Enhance Empowerment and Social Ties: The [ORG GONL  ] will sponsor a conference of the 30 largest towns and minority organizations this fall to coordinate activities . 
The [ORG GONL  ] plans to develop and maintain a diverse group of contacts within communities for consultations , and to improve the expertise of government officials and other professionals ( teachers , police , etc . 
) working within [MISC Muslim  ] communities . 
-- Involving Youth and Parents: The program establishes a summer school program for 20 at-risk college students to discuss issues such as free speech and rule of law . 
Personal coaching for leadership for high potential leaders within communities to act as role models will also be provided . 
Youth leaders will receive training in engaging in and leading debate and spokesmen for their communities , and in promoting intergenerational debate between [MISC Muslim  ] youth and their elders . 
Refugee youth , who are particularly vulnerable to radicalization , have been targeted for engagement in debates on social ties and radicalization . 
-- Emancipation of Girls and Women: Active attempts to engage women in public and private debate on issues related to religion are envisaged . 
-- Involving the [MISC Muslim Community:  ] The government is reaching out to the [MISC Muslim  ] community to counter the impression that [MISC Muslim  ] youth are not fully accepted members of [MISC Dutch  ] society , and is seeking support from [MISC Muslim  ] community leaders in explaining that that [MISC Dutch  ] society offers opportunities to those who persevere , that [MISC Islam  ] has a place in [MISC Dutch  ] society , and that [MISC Muslims  ] have much freedom to practice their religion here . 
Attempts to explain political [MISC Islam  ] to the [MISC Muslim  ] community youth are also underway , including government efforts to provide alternative perspective through popular [MISC Dutch-Moroccan  ] websites . 
The [ORG GONL  ] has also proposed funding programs to train imams in the [LOC Netherlands  ] , thus reducing the need to import potentially radical imams from abroad and increasing the links between the religious leadership and [MISC Dutch  ] society . 
Supplemental training for [MISC Koran  ] teachers and to youth workers in the various ethnic communities will be provided , and the [ORG GONL  ] will sponsor messages aimed at improving the profile of [MISC Islam  ] in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
-- Involving the native [MISC Dutch  ] Population: The program proposes establishing an [ORG Integration Council  ] consisting of both minority and majority representatives , instead of the exclusive minority representation currently in place . 
The government is also encouraging dialogue between [MISC Muslim  ] communities and media outlets and opinion-makers . 
In the next few months , there will be a national bus tour entitled [LOC Netherlands  ] New Land providing information and a platform for debate to each of the communities it visits . 
PRONG TWO: COUNTERING RADICALIZATION ------------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In addition to adopting tougher counterterrorism and immigration measures ( septels ) , the [ORG GONL  ] is focusing on increasing awareness of the dangers of radical [MISC Islam  ] , particularly among vulnerable populations , and on increasing the ability of individuals to counter the appeal of extremist groups . 
The [ORG GONL  ] 's plan notes that defending oneself against radicalization requires specific knowledge and skills , including knowing how to live with [MISC Islam  ] in a secular and [MISC Western  ] society and respect for the democratic legal order. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [ORG GONL  ] has announced the creation of neighborhood social network groups comprised of influential community members whom educators , police or parents can contact at the first signs of radicalization . 
This group will also have non-advertised contact with the [MISC Dutch  ] government and security services , but will serve as a first line of defense within the community against radicalization. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The national government has also commissioned a study , to be completed by year 's end , on the causes of radicalization and effective strategies for countering it . 
The [ORG National Counter Terrorism Board  ] ( [ORG NCTB  ] ) has also begun to monitor radical websites active in the [LOC Netherlands  ] and is carrying out notice and take down procedures . 
LOCAL EFFORTS: ------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Since the populations considered most vulnerable to radicalization are concentrated in urban areas , many of the most active counter-extremism programs have developed at the local level . 
The quasi-governmental [ORG Netherlands Institute for Safety and Crisis Management  ] ( COT ) has developed anti-radicalization programs for the cities of [LOC Amsterdam  ] and [LOC Rotterdam  ] , including guidance for local authorities on early-warning signs of radicalization . 
The programs are fairly comprehensive and include measures to combat discrimination , promote integration , and foster positive school environments on the neighborhood level . 
Another aspect of the program is the creation of a central information house or clearinghouse that collects information on groups within the [MISC Muslim  ] community from various local government agencies ( i.e. welfare , tax , passport , etc . 
) The information house has some tangential contact with law enforcement , but seeks to avoid overt ties because of political sensitivities . 
Project coordinators originally envisaged creating a database to manage information on a citywide basis , but legal restrictions including strict privacy laws have stymied progress . 
The information house will analyze information and look for trends and indicators that reveal radicalization among youths. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Another aspect of the plans is an early-warning radicalization indicator checklist . 
The list , which is being compiled by local law enforcement officials with support from the intelligence services , draws from input provided by social scientists , teachers , community leaders , and others living and working directly with vulnerable populations . 
Some indicators on the list include: relatively sudden change in appearance or activity ; sudden interest in religion ; increasingly homophobic or bigoted displays of discrimination ; increasing isolation , disaffection or absences , following of a radical figure or participation in independent religious groups , decreasing respect for women and authorities , perception of [MISC Western  ] society as the enemy , and decreasing involvement in crime . 
The list is not intended to be a comprehensive checklist , but rather a tool for local law enforcement officials and others to help identify potentially extremist individuals and groups early in the radicalization process. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) In addition to these new plans , municipalities with sizable at-risk populations already have the City of [LOC Amsterdam  ] has $61 million euros for integration and anti-radicalization efforts , some of which comes from [ORG EU  ] funds and the rest from city revenues . 
One program implemented by the city is And Now Something Positive , which provides a trip to [LOC Morocco  ] for 20 [MISC Dutch-Moroccan  ] at-risk youth for three weeks to complete service programs . 
Many of these programs are long-standing ; for example , [PER Mohammed Bouyeri  ] , the convicted murderer of filmmaker [PER Theo van Gogh  ] , grew up in an [LOC Amsterdam  ] neighborhood that has numerous community-based initiatives . 
One of them is an award winning crime prevention scheme entitled [MISC Neighborhood Fathers  ] . 
The group , a neighborhood watch program to inform authorities of illegal and extremist activity , was established in 1999 after riots erupted between [MISC Moroccan  ] youth and local police . 
[ORG NGOs  ] ---- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The government has engaged [ORG NGOs  ] and quasi-governmental organizations in developing and implementing some of the anti-radicalization strategies . 
In September , three [MISC Dutch  ] mosques in [LOC Amsterdam  ] drafted a code of conduct in cooperation with local authorities to help fight radicalism , promote democratic values and encourage imams to speak [MISC Dutch  ] in return for stronger action on discrimination against [MISC Muslims  ] . 
Also , a private [MISC Dutch  ] foundation that provides consulting advice to small businesses has recently implemented a project to provide such marketing , financial , and legal services to immigrant entrepreneurs in ethnic communities . 
EFFECTIVENESS OF [MISC DUTCH  ] PROGRAMS: ------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The comprehensive national anti-radicalization plan is still in the early stages of being implemented , so its real impact cannot be judged at this time . 
There is no question that relations between [MISC Muslim  ] and non-Muslim populations in the [LOC Netherlands  ] is a politically volatile issue , and there is broad agreement that engaging the [MISC Muslim  ] community to reduce radicalization should be a high priority of the government at all levels . 
On the other hand , Minister [PER Verdonk  ] -- who is personally identified with controversial proposals to reduce [MISC Muslim  ] immigration and to remove radical imams from the [LOC Netherlands  ] -- is extremely unpopular among the [MISC Dutch  ] [MISC Muslim  ] population . 
The fact that her ministry is developing and championing the latest government outreach programs is , therefore , cause for skepticism . 
Although [PER Verdonk  ] 's ministry has sought the input of [MISC Muslim  ] organizations in developing its ideas , a contact in her recently confided that overcoming the doubts of the [MISC Muslim  ] community regarding the government 's intentions will be a major challenge. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) The government recognizes that existing integration and community policing efforts at the local level have more credibility and better chances of success than a new national initiatives . 
For this reason , many of the proposals in [PER Verdonk  ] 's plan are intended to reinforce and strengthen local efforts . 
For example , the plan envisions establishing a national center acting as extremist hotline/call center to provide support to local community officials . 
A community policeman from [LOC Amsterdam  ] recently told post that having access to such a center might have helped local police deal with [PER Mohammed Bouyeri  ] ( [PER Theo van Gogh  ] 's murderer ) before he turned to violence . 
The policeman , who knew [PER Bouyeri  ] personally from this former involvement in community activities , had been arrested one month prior to the murder for riding a metro train without a ticket . 
The policeman observed that [PER Bouyeri  ] had drastically changed his appearance -- growing longer hair and a full beard -- and refused to shake hands with his former , non-Muslim , friends . 
The community policeman notified the police intelligence unit about his concerns , but there was no mechanism in place to effectively deal with [PER Bouyeri  ] 's dramatic evolution and danger signs . 
II . 
[LOC U.S.  ] [ORG MISSION OUTREACH  ] ------------------------- GENERAL APPROACH ---------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Embassy The [ORG Hague  ] and the [LOC Amsterdam  ] Consulate are actively broadening their existing networks of [MISC Muslim  ] contacts , [ORG NGO  ] 's , and other organizations dealing with [MISC Muslim  ] youth . 
In this regard , the [ORG International Visitor Leadership Program  ] ( [ORG IVLP  ] ) has been especially effective tool . 
Upon their return from the [LOC U.S.  ] , [MISC Muslim  ] participants in this program have helped broaden the [ORG Mission  ] 's circle of contacts by helping to set up joint events and other outreach activities . 
Each year since 2001 , an increasing portion of the [ORG Mission  ] 's [ORG IVLP  ] slate has been filled by [MISC Dutch  ] [MISC Muslims  ] , a trend the mission fully intends to continue ( see below ) . 
The [ORG Mission Program Plan  ] ( [ORG MPP  ] ) will be modified this year to reflect the higher priority given to expanding [ORG Mission  ] contacts with and understanding of the [MISC Dutch Muslim  ] community . 
[ORG SPECIFIC STEPS:  ] -------------- MISSION-WIDE ------------ <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) To better coordinate its outreach and reporting activities related to countering extremism , the [ORG Mission  ] established an [ORG Integration Issues Working Group  ] in August , 2005 to bring together all relevant Embassy elements . 
The group is chaired by the Political Counselor and includes representatives from [LOC ECON  ] , [LOC PA  ] , [LOC GLO  ] , [ORG RSO  ] , [ORG FCS  ] , LEGATT , AMCONSULATE [LOC Amsterdam  ] , and other [ORG Mission  ] elements . 
The [MISC Charge D'Affaires  ] actively follows and participates in the activities of the [ORG Working Group  ] , which meets every two weeks , to review [ORG Mission  ] activities in this area and to develop future plans . 
Among the projects initiated specifically by the Group to improve the sharing of information are: -- A mission-wide data base of contacts in the [MISC Dutch  ] [MISC Muslim  ] community and others involved in integration/counter-radicalization efforts ; -- A calendar of upcoming [MISC Muslim-  ] or extremism-related events ; -- An archive of public and mission-produced documents related to counter-extremism in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
-- Detailed reporting and outreach plans for each section. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) Since August the [ORG Working Group  ] has developed a comprehensive engagement plan for [MISC Ramadan  ] 2005 , identified four new [MISC Muslim  ] IV candidates , and conducted a series of round table discussions on integration and extremism with local contacts chaired by the [MISC Charge  ] d'Affaires . 
The [ORG Country Team  ] has adopted a policy of inviting at least one [MISC Dutch-Muslim  ] contact to all Embassy receptions and events . 
During the upcoming [MISC Ramadan  ] season , the [MISC Charge  ] will host ( for the first time ) an [ORG Iftar  ] dinner at his residence , and will also invite Ambassadors and Consuls from predominantly [MISC Muslim  ] countries to a separate event . 
Embassy participants will attend [ORG Iftar  ] dinners with [MISC Dutch  ] [MISC Muslim  ] families in conjunction with the country 's first nationwide [ORG Ramadan Festival  ] . 
[ORG PUBLIC AFFAIRS  ] -------------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) During the current fiscal year , the [ORG Mission  ] sent four [MISC Dutch  ] [MISC Muslim  ] IV grantees to the [LOC U.S.  ] Two participated in a program on E-Commerce and the [LOC U.S.  ] Economy and two in Managing Diversity in a [ORG Multi-Ethnic Society  ] . 
Furthermore , the Embassy hosted 'Citizen [PER Diplomat' Nassar Beydoun  ] , Member of the [ORG Board of the American Arab Chamber of Commerce  ] and President , [ORG Project Control Systems Inc  ] . 
His program included meetings with the [MISC Dutch  ] government , [LOC City  ] of The [ORG Hague  ] and [LOC City  ] of [LOC Amsterdam  ] officials , young ethnic entrepreneurs , [MISC Muslim  ] students , and a dinner with former [MISC Muslim  ] [ORG IVLP  ] alumni . 
Last year the Ambassador , the [ORG PAO  ] and PD staff attended two [ORG Iftar  ] dinners in [LOC Amsterdam.  ] <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) In November , [ORG Dr. Gary Weaver  ] , an [ORG International Affairs  ] professor and immigration and multi-cultural expert at [ORG American University  ] , will serve as a [LOC U.S.  ] speaker on the topic , Immigrants , Identity and Integration in Multi-Cultural Democracies . 
The target audience are [MISC Muslim  ] groups and [MISC Dutch  ] officials who are engaged in integration initiatives . 
[ORG Public Affairs  ] promoted [MISC Dutch  ] involvement in the [ORG State Department  ] 's 9/28 web chat with [ORG Dr. Weaver  ] on this topic . 
The [ORG Public Affairs  ] section has also helped line up [MISC American  ] speakers for the national [MISC Ramadan  ] festival , such as [ORG Dr.  ] [PER Kamran Ali  ] , a visiting [MISC American  ] [PER Fulbright Scholar  ] at [ORG Leiden University  ] , [ORG Dr. Jessica Stern of Harvard University  ] , and [ORG Dr.  ] [PER Shabbir Mansuri  ] , the Founding Director of the Council on [ORG Islamic Education  ] ( based in [LOC San Francisco  ] ) . 
The section is also attempting to place op-ed pieces in community newspapers in predominantly [MISC Muslim  ] neighborhoods. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) In consultation with [ORG Public Affairs  ] section the [PER Fulbright  ] commission has greatly stepped up its outreach to [MISC Dutch  ] [MISC Muslims  ] . 
The commission hired a part-time [MISC Dutch  ] Turkish immigrant who has helped the commission to increase the number of [MISC Dutch  ] immigrant applicants for [PER Fulbright  ] study grants . 
For example , 27 [MISC Dutch  ] immigrant applicants submitted applications before the 9/16/05 Early Application deadline out of 181 applicants. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) The [ORG Public Affairs  ] section is also actively engaging media outlets to promote the counter-extremism agenda . 
For example , the Embassy sponsored a [LOC U.S.  ] reporting tour for journalists from four [MISC Dutch  ] cities with large [MISC Muslim  ] populations focused on the immigration , integration , and assimilation experience in the [LOC U.S.  ] The Section is also working to place op-ed style pieces in community newspapers in predominantly [MISC Muslim  ] neighborhoods . 
OTHER SECTIONS -------------- <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) In coordination with the [ORG Working Group  ] and [ORG Public Affairs  ] , other [ORG Mission  ] elements have actively stepped up their outreach to the [MISC Muslim  ] community and other activities to reflect [ORG Mission  ] priorities . 
These include: -- Consulate General: Consulate staff have stepped up their already active outreach to [MISC Dutch  ] [MISC Muslim  ] community leaders in [LOC Amsterdam  ] , including by visiting mosques and participating in mosque-sponsored events . 
The Consul General regularly attends meetings with local [MISC Muslim  ] groups , has attended [ORG Iftar  ] events . 
In September , 2005 she represented the [ORG USG  ] at the opening of a new [ORG Islamic University  ] in [LOC Rotterdam.  ] . 
-- Political Section: POL requested and received in August a Presidential Management Fellow ( PMF ) to focus exclusively on issues related to [MISC Dutch  ] [MISC Muslim  ] integration , radicalization , and extremism . 
Her efforts have already substantially enhanced the Section 's contact base and reporting opportunities . 
The Political Section is also engaging with [MISC Dutch  ] government and think-tank contacts on the possibility of organizing an [MISC Islamic  ] Extremism conference in the [LOC Netherlands  ] sometime in the coming year . 
-- Global Issues: The [MISC Global Issues  ] section has engaged the Ministries responsible for anti-radicalization programs , including the [ORG Ministry of Interior , Ministry of Justice  ] , and the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] and has extensively researched local governments' anti-radicalization programs . 
The section is also preparing an IV visit for a policy officer at the [ORG National Counter Terrorism Board  ] who works on anti-radicalization issues . 
-- [ORG Foreign Commercial Service: FCS  ] has intensified its engagement with minority business owners and community leaders . 
It is participating in the [ORG Black Woman Business Owners' Association  ] , which includes [MISC Muslim  ] women business leaders . 
[ORG FCS  ] is also actively recruiting [MISC Dutch-Muslim  ] students for its intern program . 
-- Economic Section: [LOC ECON  ] will cooperate with [ORG FCS  ] in outreach activity , and is drafting a report detailing the socioeconomic realities of [MISC Muslims  ] in the [LOC Netherlands  ] .
