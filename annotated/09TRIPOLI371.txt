REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) [ORG Summary: Community of Sahel-Saharan States  ] ( [ORG CEN-SAD  ] ) Secretary-General [PER Mohammed  ] al-Madani views the deepening relationship between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Libya  ] as a positive sign that his organization can benefit from increased cooperation with the [ORG USG  ] on development , political , security , and cultural issues . 
Playing off [MISC Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi 's recent assertion that [LOC Libya  ] did not need to join the [ORG Trans-Sahara Counter Terrorism Partnership  ] ( [ORG TSCTP  ] ) because it duplicated [ORG CEN-SAD  ] 's efforts , the Ambassador encouraged al-Madani to re-examine the benefits of [ORG TSCTP  ] and to develop a relationship with [ORG U.S. Africa Command  ] to coordinate on regional security issues . 
[PER Al-Madani  ] responded that all member states would welcome training and intelligence sharing with the [LOC U.S.  ] , but that a strong " boots on the ground " presence would be unwelcome and encourage terrorist cells in the [LOC Sahara  ] to strike [LOC U.S.  ] and member-state interests in the region . 
End Summary . 
AMBASSADOR PROMOTES [ORG TSCTP  ] AS CONGRUENT WITH [ORG CEN-SAD MISSION  ] 2 . 
( C ) In a May 5 courtesy call with [ORG CEN-SAD  ] Secretary-General [PER Mohammed  ] al-Madani , the Ambassador urged a re-examination of [LOC Libya  ] 's participation in [ORG TSCTP  ] . 
While [MISC Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi had stated to [ORG USG  ] officials during his recent trip to [LOC Washington  ] that [LOC Libya  ] did not need a regional security partnership like [ORG TSCTP  ] because of its [ORG CEN-SAD  ] membership , [MISC Libyan  ] participation in [ORG TSCTP  ] would enhance [ORG CEN-SAD  ] 's capacity to provide regional security and counter-terrorism training and joint exercises . 
The Ambassador encouraged al-Madani to develop relationships with [ORG U.S. Africa Command  ] 's leadership , especially given the new administration 's renewed focus on the continent . 
[PER Al-Madani  ] responded by saying that [LOC Libya  ] " always prefers cooperation with our friends in the [LOC USA  ] " and said [LOC U.S.  ] support was critical to ensure that [ORG CEN-SAD  ] governments could confront militants in their territory . 
While acknowledging that [LOC U.S.  ] training was a key part of capacity building , he cautioned that [MISC American  ] " boots on the ground " would be unwelcome by member states who valued their sovereignty , and that terrorist organizations would use any [LOC U.S.  ] presence as a pretext to attack government installations . 
The Ambassador assured him that the embassy and AFRICOM were aware of the sensitivities and prepared to work with [LOC Libya  ] to ensure " red lines " were not crossed . 
However , at the same time , it was unrealistic to think that an [MISC American  ] presence could be entirely invisible if we were to engage in training and other activities . 
3 . 
( C ) [PER Al-Madani  ] noted that the [ORG CEN-SAD  ] region faced crises including terrorist networks operating in northern [LOC Mali  ] , southern [LOC Algeria  ] , and [LOC Mauritania  ] . 
The ongoing proxy-war in [LOC Chad  ] and [LOC Sudan  ] left a " vacuum " of power cutting through the middle of the [ORG CEN-SAD  ] area that could destabilize all of the neighboring states . 
He noted that terrorists have settled into the [LOC Sahara  ] region and highlighted their marriages to local women as a sign that they feel no pressure to leave . 
His organization has responded by increasing the number of high-level fora for political , military , and intelligence leaders . 
He told the Ambassador that [ORG CEN-SAD  ] would hold a forum for intelligence service directors sometime in May and that he planned to invite security officers from the [LOC U.S.  ] , the [LOC UK  ] and [LOC Spain  ] in an observer capacity . 
In turn , the Ambassador invited al-Madani to send a representative to an [MISC NDU-sponsored  ] seminar in [LOC Dakar  ] in June . 
[MISC CHAD-SUDAN  ] CONFLICT EXACERBATED BY KHARTOUM'S UNWILLINGNESS TO TALK 4 . 
( C ) Discussing the [MISC Chad-Sudan  ] conflict , al-Madani said the situation is made more complex because the [ORG GOS  ] leadership had no serious intention of finding a political solution with the [ORG GOC  ] . 
Instead , the [ORG GOS  ] has decided that Deby should be toppled ; the [ORG GOS  ] had no intention to observe or enforce the [ORG Doha Accord  ] . 
Describing [LOC Chad  ] as key to resolving the crisis in [LOC Darfur  ] , he said that [LOC Libya  ] would not let " regime change by force stand [ in [LOC Chad  ] ] " and cautioned that the [ORG GOS  ] must not play " both covert and overt roles " by fighting and talking peace at the same time . 
While not absolving rebel groups of responsibility , he cited the GOS' attempts to splinter and marginalize the rebels as a sign that [LOC Khartoum  ] had no intention of meeting the rebels' " uncomplicated " demands . 
5 . 
( C ) Comment and bio note: [PER Mohammed  ] al-Madani has been Secretary-General of [ORG CEN-SAD  ] since its founding in 1998 by [LOC Libya  ] . 
Muammar al-Qadhafi has described the organization as " the base on which the [MISC African  ] pyramid will be built " and member-state diplomats have described it as a vehicle for [LOC Libya  ] TRIPOLI 00000371 002.2 OF 002 to broaden its foreign policy reach . 
[PER Al-Madani  ] previously served as [LOC Libya  ] 's ambassador to [LOC Burkina Faso  ] and [LOC Mali  ] and as Deputy Foreign Minister under [PER Abdulati Obeidi  ] . 
The tenor of his statements made him seem much more like a representative of the [MISC Libyan  ] government than the executive of a 28-member regional organization . 
He studied law in [LOC France  ] , but did not practice . 
Before joining the diplomatic corps , he served as an official in [LOC Libya  ] 's student union as the officer responsible for the union 's foreign affairs . 
He spoke some [MISC English  ] and seemed to understand it well , though he used an interpreter .
