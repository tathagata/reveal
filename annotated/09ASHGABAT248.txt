( C ) The [MISC Turkmen  ] Government announced earlier this month that President [PER Berdimuhamedov  ] had signed a decree allowing the state chemical concern " Turkmenkhimiya " to enter into a contract with [MISC Ekomet-S  ] of [LOC Russia  ] for the transfer and burial of radioactive waste . 
The waste was reportedly produced at the [LOC Hazar  ] chemical plant and at the [LOC Balkanabat  ] iodine plant. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) In a meeting with the Charge on February 17 , [MISC Turkish  ] Ambassador [PER Huseyin Bichakli  ] raised concerns about reports that [LOC Turkmenistan  ] and [LOC Russia  ] plan to resume uranium production in [LOC Turkmenistan  ] . 
He said that he had learned from sources that a [MISC Russian  ] military delegation had visited [LOC Turkmenistan  ] in early January and visited the site of a former " uranium " plant at [LOC Kizilkaya  ] in [LOC Balkan Province  ] . 
The plant operated during the [MISC Soviet  ] era . 
He said that the delegation was also briefed on the planned [MISC North-South  ] railroad line from [LOC Russia  ] to [LOC Iran  ] , which includes a 700 km stretch through [LOC Turkmenistan  ] . 
Ambassador [PER Bichakli  ] said there were rumors that the railroad would be used to transport uranium processed at the currently inactive [MISC Turkmen  ] uranium plant to [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) COMMENT: Ambassador [PER Bichakli  ] did not provide his sources , but noted that for [LOC Turkmenistan  ] to collaborate with [LOC Russia  ] to transport processed uranium to [LOC Iran  ] , particularly in a surreptitious manner , is inconsistent with its policy of neutrality . 
Post will report any further information on this issue . 
END COMMENT .
