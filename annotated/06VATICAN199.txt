( C ) Summary . 
[PER Pope Benedict XVI  ] 's September 12 speech in [LOC Regensburg  ] caused an unwanted firestorm in the [MISC Islamic  ] world because of the pope 's quoting , in passing , an insulting reference made by a 14th-century [MISC Byzantine  ] emperor . 
The [LOC Holy See  ] , and the pope himself , responded with statements of clarification and regret in the ensuing days . 
While the pope surely did not intend such an outcome , his own approach toward [MISC Islam  ] and toward interreligious dialogue is cooler than that of his predecessor . 
Post expects further papal comments on the matter on September 20 , unless the controversy has died down by then , and will report further in the coming days . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) During his recent visit to [LOC Germany  ] , [PER Pope Benedict XVI  ] gave a lecture to a gathering of academics on September 12 at the [ORG University of Regensburg  ] . 
The lecture , entitled " Faith , Reason and the [ORG University: Memories and Reflections  ] " , fairly long at roughly 3800 words , was of a learned sort , and focused on the relationship of reason and faith in the [MISC Western  ] world . 
At the outset of his remarks , the pope cited a comment made by a 14th century [MISC Byzantine  ] emperor , [PER Manuel II Paleologus  ] , in order to make the point that proselytizing by violence is unacceptable to [MISC Christians  ] , if not necessarily to [MISC Muslims  ] . 
The actual quotation included a stinging reference to the prophet [PER Mohammed  ] . 
This reference , a very small part of the lecture , subsequently produced an inflamed reaction in the [MISC Muslim  ] world , several contrite statements from [LOC Rome  ] , and considerable commentary . 
In order to shed some light on this unexpected controversy , this cable takes a look at what the pope said , the reactions it produced , and our interpretation of the situation . 
What the [PER Pope Said  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Following a bit of personal reminiscence about his own university days , the pope embarked on the lecture with the following passage: " I was reminded of all this recently , when I read the edition by Professor [PER Theodore Khoury  ] ( [MISC Munster  ] ) of part of the dialogue carried on -- perhaps in 1391 in the winter barracks near [LOC Ankara  ] -- by the erudite Byuzantiine emperor [PER Manuel II Paleologus  ] and an educated [MISC Persian  ] on the subject of Christianity and [MISC Islam  ] , and the truth of both . 
It was probably the emperor himself who set down this dialogue , during the siege of [LOC Constantinople  ] between 1394 and 1402 ; and this would explain why his arguments are given in greater detail than the responses of the learned [MISC Persian  ] . 
The dialogue ranges widely over the structures of faith contained in the [MISC Bible  ] and in the [MISC Qur'an  ] , and deals especially with the image of [PER God  ] and of man , while necessarily returning repeatedly to the relationship of the three [LOC Laws:  ] the [MISC Old Testament  ] , the [MISC New Testament  ] , and the [MISC Qur'an  ] . 
In this lecture I would like to discuss only one point -- itself rather marginal to the dialogue itself -- which , in the context of faith and reason , I found interesting and which can serve as the starting-point for my reflections on the issue . 
" In the seventh conversation edited by Professor [PER Khoury  ] , the emperor touches on the theme of the jihad ( holy war ) . the emperor must have known that surah 2 , 256 reads: There is no compulsion in religion . 
It is one of the suras of the early period , when [PER Mohammed  ] was still powerless and under threat . 
But naturally the emperor also know the instructions , devloped later and recorded in the [MISC Qur'an  ] , concerning holy war . 
Without descending to details , such as the difference in treatment accorded to those who have the " Book " and the " infidels " , he turns to his interlocutor somewhat brusquely with the central question on the relationship between religion and violence in general , in these words: " Show me just what [PER Mohammed  ] brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached . 
" The emperor goes on to explain in detail the reasons why spreading the faith through violence is something unreasonable . 
Violence is incompatible with the nature of [PER God  ] and the nature of the soul . 
[PER God  ] is not pleased by blood , and not acting reasonably is contrary to [PER God  ] 's nature . 
Faith is born of the soul , not the body . 
Whoever would lead someone to faith needs the ability to speak well and to reason properly , without violence and threats... . 
To convince a reasonable soul , one does not need a strong arm , or weapons of any kind , or any other means of threatening a person with death... . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) The remainder of the lecture says very little about [MISC Islam  ] [LOC VATICAN  ] 00000199 002.2 OF 003 ( except for a passage suggesting that [MISC Muslims  ] differ from [MISC Christians  ] in their willingness to accept [PER God  ] as absolutely transcending reason ) and focuses instead on ancient [MISC Greek  ] philosophy , Medieval [MISC Christian  ] scholarship , and modern [MISC European  ] thinking about the relationship of faith and reason . 
It concludes with an echo of the [PER Manuel  ] quotation to affirm that reason and faith can and must go together . 
Reactions -------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The lecture received substantial media coverage . 
By September 14 criticism had been heard from various [MISC Muslim  ] authorities ; this criticism intensified in the following days . 
According to press reports , the president of [LOC Turkey  ] 's [ORG Religious Affairs Directorate  ] , [PER Ali Bardakoglu  ] , said he read the pope 's speech with amazement and horror , and he considered it to be provocative , hostile , prejudicial , and a barrage of other uncomplimentary terms . 
[PER Aiman Mazyek  ] , Secretary-General of the [ORG Central Council  ] of [MISC Muslims  ] in [LOC Germany  ] , and [PER Dalil Boubakeur  ] , head of the [ORG French Council  ] for the [ORG Muslim Religion  ] , were also quick to express concern . 
Senior [MISC Islamic  ] officials in [LOC Kuwait  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] , and [LOC Pakistan  ] called for an apology . 
Other prominent [MISC Muslims  ] , such as [MISC Indonesian  ] President [PER Susilo  ] and former [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Khatami  ] , called for caution and hoped for clarification . 
Most recently , al-Qaeda militants in [LOC Iraq  ] have reportedly vowed war on " worshippers of the cross " in reaction to the papal remarks . 
In [LOC Somalia  ] , gunmen shot an [MISC Italian  ] nun , but it is not clear that the attack was related to the papal statement. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) The [MISC Turkish  ] government has so far resisted calls to postpone or cancel the [PER Pope  ] 's planned November visit to [LOC Istanbul  ] . 
The [MISC Moroccan  ] government recalled its ambassador to the [LOC Holy See  ] for consultations. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) The [LOC Vatican  ] responded later on September 14 with a statement from Father [PER Federico Lombardi  ] , the [LOC Holy See  ] 's spokesman . 
[PER Lombardi  ] said it was certainly not the pope 's intention to offend the sensibilities of [MISC Muslim  ] believers , and went on to emphasize that the pope wants to cultivate an attitude of respect and dialogue toward other religions and cultures , " obviously also toward [MISC Islam  ] " . <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On September 16 , the newly-installed Secretary of State , Cardinal [PER Tarcisio Bertone  ] , issued an additional statement . 
[PER Bertone  ] noted the reaction in [MISC Muslim  ] quarters to the pope 's remarks , as well as the clarifications and explanations already presented by the director of the [LOC Holy See  ] press office ( [PER Lombardi  ] ) . 
[PER Bertone  ] said the pope: ( a ) has a view of [MISC Islam  ] which is unequivocally that expressed in " [MISC Nostra Aetate  ] " -- a seminal [MISC Vatican II  ] document on interfaith relations -- i.e. , that the Church regards [MISC Muslims  ] with esteem ( for their reverence for [PER Jesus  ] and [PER Mary  ] , their monotheism , their obedience to [PER God  ] , etc . 
) . 
( b ) strongly favors interreligious and intercultural dialogue ( c ) did not mean to imply that he shares the views of [PER Manuel II  ] which he quoted in his remarks ( d ) " sincerely regrets that certain passages of his address could have sounded offensive to the sensitivities of the [MISC Muslim  ] faithful , and ( could have been ) interpreted in a manner that in no way corresponds to his intentions . 
" ( e ) hopes [MISC Muslims  ] " will be helped " to understand the correct meaning of his words in the interests of faith , peace , and justice. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Bertone  ] gave an interview on September 17 in which he said that papal nuncios had been asked to explain the pope 's remarks in their host countries . 
[PER Bertone  ] criticized the media for its role in the crisis , and said the pope 's words had been " seriously manipulated " . 
Cardinal [PER Renato Martino  ] , head of the [LOC Holy See  ] 's influential Justice and Peace dicastery , wrote a front-page article in [ORG L'Osservatore Romano  ] on September 17 , in which he blamed the controversy on mass media distortions and " orchestrated political and ideological exploitation " . 
[PER Martino  ] said , rather awkwardly , that if some believers from another religion feel offended , they should know that the pope 's desire is to inspire sentiments of respect and [MISC Christian  ] friendship for all true adherents of other religions . 
Other prominent [MISC Catholics  ] around the world , such as [MISC British  ] Cardinal [PER Murphy-O'Connor  ] , also came to the pope 's defense . 
[LOC VATICAN  ] 00000199 003.2 OF 003 The [PER Pope  ] 's Regrets ---------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) At his weekly [MISC Angelus  ] address on Sunday , September 17 , [PER Pope Benedict XVI  ] himself spoke to the issue , albeit briefly . 
Speaking in [LOC Castelgandolfo  ] , and making his first public remarks since returning from [LOC Germany  ] , he said " I am deeply sorry for the reactions in some countries to a few passages of my address at the [ORG University of Regensburg  ] , which were considered offensive to the sensibility of [MISC Muslims  ] . 
These in fact were a quotation from a medieval text , which do not in any way express my personal thought . 
Yesterday the Cardinal Secretary of State published a statement in this regard in which he explained the true meaning of my words . 
I hope that this serves to appease hearts and to clarify the true meaning of my address , which in its totality was and is an invitation to frank and sincere dialogue , with great mutual respect . 
" Comment -------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Charge d'affaires has appointments pending with [LOC Holy See  ] officials and others , and will report the results of those conversations as soon as possible . 
We will also be sending in a summary of relevant media coverage. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) For the moment , it is clear that [PER Pope Benedict XVI  ] has created an unwanted controversy with potentially significant , and harmful , implications . 
A common view is that the pope , a studious and retiring academic by nature , simply didn't imagine that his historical reference could cause such heartburn . 
While defenders have blamed the media , or trouble-seeking [MISC Muslims  ] , others have noted that the firestorm could easily have been foreseen , and forestalled , had the pope circulated his text in advance to his deputies . 
( A powerful intellect long accustomed to writing his own material , [PER Benedict  ] is not in the habit of having his material vetted . 
) <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) On the other hand , it taxes the imagination in today 's world to suppose that a reference -- by the pope ! -- to the Prophet [PER Mohammed  ] 's innovations as " evil and inhuman " would pass unnoticed . 
Nor is it likely that the particular quotation is accidental . 
[PER Benedict  ] is known for his meticulous ways , and also for his distinctly cooler ( compared to [PER John Paul II  ] ) approach toward [MISC Islam  ] and interreligious dialogue . 
The pope is preparing for an important visit to [LOC Istanbul  ] in November . 
His invocation of [PER Manuel  ] , an emperor whose life was defined in combat with the [MISC Ottomans  ] who destroyed his empire a few decades later , must have been deliberate . 
So , too , the decision to quote the precise words of [PER Manuel  ] -- rather than a milder paraphrase -- is significant in a pope known for his belief that one must neither compromise with the truth , nor back down from defending the faith . 
( As Cardinal [PER Ratzinger  ] , he was also known for his belief that [LOC Turkey  ] should not enter the [ORG European Union  ] . 
) One of the pope 's hardline [MISC Italian  ] supporters , journalist [PER Sandro Magister  ] , argued in a September 18 column that [PER Benedict  ] has deliberately chosen a path of " less diplomacy and more [ORG Gospel  ] " , with marked willingness to say politically incorrect things. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Our view is that [PER Benedict  ] very likely chose his words carefully and was not averse to having them interpreted as a sign of his skepticism about [MISC Islam  ] ; his earlier actions , such as the transfer of Archbishop [PER Michael Fitzgerald  ] last spring , made this attitude clear enough . 
However , he surely did not intend for them to lead to violence or a worsening of tensions between [MISC Christians  ] and [MISC Muslims  ] . 
The quick succession of mollifying remarks by senior [LOC Vatican  ] officials , including the pope , is unusual and suggests a chastened feeling at the top . 
However , the actual " apology " is itself phrased rather carefully and may fall short of putting out the fire . 
Upon return from a trip , popes customarily reflect upon the trip at the next public opportunity ; in this case , that means the Wednesday audience on September 20 . 
We will watch developments closely. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) From our perspective , any USG comments on the matter should carefully note the [LOC Holy See  ] 's own statements , particularly the [PER Pope  ] 's own comments confirming that his remarks have been misunderstood and dissociating himself from [PER Manuel  ] 's words about the prophet . 
Cardinal [PER Bertone  ] 's clarification of the [LOC Holy See  ] 's continuing dedication to the principles of [ORG Nostra Aetate  ] ( see para 8 ) and deep respect for [MISC Islam  ] should also be noted .
