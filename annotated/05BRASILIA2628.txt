( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [LOC United States Mission  ] in [LOC Brazil  ] warmly welcomes your planned October 5 to 7 visit to [LOC Brasilia  ] . 
Ambassador [PER Danilovich  ] will meet you upon arrival the evening of October 5 . 
The next day , we have scheduled meetings for you with Foreign Minister [PER Amorim  ] , Finance Minister [PER Palocci  ] , [ORG Presidential International Affairs Advisor Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] , and [ORG Senate  ] leaders . 
We have also scheduled you to announce the 2006 selections for the [ORG Mission 's Youth  ] Ambassador 's program , to meet with the press and to informally meet and greet Embassy direct-hire personnel . 
The meeting request with President [PER Lula  ] is still pending. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Your visit comes in the wake of a series of meetings in [LOC Washington  ] between [MISC Brazilian  ] cabinet ministers and their [ORG USG  ] counterparts the week of September 25 . 
Foreign Minister [PER Amorim  ] met with Secretary Rice , [PER USTR Portman  ] , and yourself . 
Trade Minister [PER Furlan  ] , in town for the annual [MISC Brazil-U.S  ] . 
[ORG Business Council  ] meeting , met with Secretary [PER Gutierrez  ] , [PER USTR Portman  ] , and Secretary [PER Bodman  ] . 
Finance Minister [PER Palocci  ] , in [LOC Washington  ] to attend the [MISC Bank/Fund  ] meetings , met with Secretary [PER Snow  ] . 
And Environment Minister [PER Silva  ] attended a SIPDIS bilateral meeting on environmental issues . 
THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP -------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) While relations between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] are friendly , often the [ORG USG  ] encounters major difficulties in gaining the cooperation of senior policymakers on issues of significant interest to the [LOC United States  ] . 
Eager to assert its own influence , the [MISC Brazilian  ] government shies away from cooperation with the [ORG USG  ] - unless it can clearly be characterized as a reciprocal exchange among equals . 
Indeed , hyper-sensitivity on issues viewed as infringing on [LOC Brazil  ] 's sovereignty can get out of hand and may be seen as signs of political immaturity . 
Many [MISC Brazilians  ] believe the [LOC U.S.  ] has designs on the [LOC Amazon  ] . 
Our fingerprinting of visitors to the [LOC U.S.  ] drew reciprocal treatment for [MISC Americans  ] here ; visa and immigration issues remain sensitive points. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) During recent months , our ongoing dialogue with the [MISC Brazilians  ] has focused on a variety of potentially useful projects for both sides . 
We sought to interest the [ORG GOB  ] in a [ORG Defense Cooperation Accord  ] , but the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] rejected the proposal even though the [ORG Defense Ministry  ] was supportive . 
Gaining agreement on privileges and immunities to be granted [LOC U.S.  ] servicemen engaging in military exercises has been just as tough sledding , as the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] saw it as " a foot in the door " and linked it with [LOC Brazil  ] 's strong opposition to [ORG Article  ] 98 agreements . 
While we seek to get the [ORG GOB  ] to move forward with an agreement governing space launches at the country 's equatorial base at [LOC Alcantara  ] , our pleas are met with silence even as [LOC Brazil  ] has executed space-related agreements with [LOC Ukraine  ] and others . 
On trade issues , when unscripted , President [PER Lula  ] has characterized the [ORG FTAA  ] as " off his agenda . 
" IPR is another sore point , as it has become clear that the [ORG USG  ] and the [MISC Brazilian  ] government have differing views on the protection to be afforded to intellectual property . 
Only after gargantuan efforts have we gotten the [ORG GOB  ] to turn the corner on copyright piracy and ( apparently ) persuaded policymakers to seek negotiated solutions on compulsory licensing of AIDs anti-retrovirals. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) However , all our conversations are not difficult . 
At the personal level , [PER Lula  ] has met President [PER Bush  ] several times and the two have a good rapport . 
On issues involving matters perceived as technical in nature - i.e. , law enforcement and science ( but not the environment or counter-terrorism ) - the [ORG GOB  ] is eager to engage . 
For example , from 2003 to 2004 , the [ORG GOB  ] worked quietly with us on the timing and details of its shoot-down program to accommodate our statutory requirements ( although now a new crop of [ORG GOB  ] bureaucrats appears to be unaware of the government 's past promises ) . 
Foreign Minister [PER Amorim  ] 's statements to the press in the wake of his September 26 meeting with you , i.e. , to the effect that [LOC Brazil  ] would seek as a deliverable during the upcoming [MISC POTUS  ] visit intensified bilateral dialogue on scientific , education , and environmental issues , reflect this desire to cooperate only on matters of marginal interest to the [LOC U.S.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) On development assistance issues , our dialogue is positive - but still constrained . 
Despite lackluster results , the [MISC Brazilian  ] government 's multi-billion dollar poverty alleviation program - [MISC Zero Hunger  ] - receives substantial funding from the [ORG World Bank  ] and the [ORG IDB  ] . 
Given [ORG USG  ] budget constraints and the fact that [MISC Zero Hunger  ] is , in essence , a cash transfer program , [ORG USAID  ] support has been limited . 
Instead of focusing on cash transfers to the poor , [ORG USAID  ] has sought to target its efforts towards promoting sustainable livelihoods - inter alia , through working with small and medium-sized enterprises . 
[ORG PA  ] 's Youth Ambassador program takes a similar targeted approach . 
This difference in focus , broad cash transfers versus targeted assistance , ends up putting the [ORG USG  ] at the margins of [LOC Brazil  ] 's overall anti-poverty efforts . 
FOREIGN POLICY -------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) In large part due to [LOC Brazil  ] 's ambivalence towards the [LOC United States  ] , President [PER Lula  ] has run an activist foreign policy with a focus on [LOC South America  ] and the Third World , seeking to forge alliances with other mid-sized powers ( [LOC South Africa  ] , [LOC India  ] , etc ) . 
He has traveled extensively in pursuit of a higher international profile for [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Despite prodding from the [ORG USG  ] and others , [PER Lula  ] has refused to condemn [LOC Cuba  ] for human rights violations and , in fact , has pushed for [MISC Cuban  ] membership in the [ORG Rio Group  ] . 
[LOC Brazil  ] has also advocated a [MISC Cuba-Mercosul  ] trade pact . 
In addition , the [ORG GOB  ] has worked to increase both its economic and political ties with [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
Enhanced integration of the two countries' energy sectors is high on its agenda . 
[PER Lula  ] has been especially solicitous of [PER Chavez  ] . 
During the September 29-30 [MISC South American  ] Community of [LOC Nations Summit  ] in [LOC Brasilia  ] , [PER Lula  ] praised the [MISC Venezuelan  ] President 's democratic credentials ( " if anything , [LOC Venezuela  ] has an excess of democracy " ) and declared that the [PER Chavez  ] government had been demonized by its foes . 
We understand that the [PER Lula  ] administration even paid for the transportation costs of [LOC Brazil  ] 's youth contingent attending the recent [ORG Bolivaran Youth Festival  ] in [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
Given all this , it would be unrealistic to expect [MISC Brazilian  ] activism in support of [MISC Venezuelan  ] democracy. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) In the face of declining inter-bloc trade , [LOC Brazil  ] has sought to revitalize Mercosul . 
It has pursued [MISC Mercosul-USG  ] trade talks , an effort seen by many as a way to delay/derail the [ORG FTAA  ] process . 
Indeed , given its size and natural resources , [LOC Brazil  ] has long seen itself as the natural leader of the region ( even though that perception is not shared by many of its neighbors ) . <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Emblematic of [LOC Brazil  ] 's efforts to gain greater standing on the world stage is its tenacious pursuit of a permanent [ORG UN Security  ] council ( [ORG UNSC  ] ) seat . 
[LOC Brazil  ] and other G4 states ( [LOC India  ] , [LOC Germany  ] , [LOC Japan  ] ) are , despite recent setbacks , continuing to press their campaign for a vote on a resolution on [ORG UNSC  ] reform . 
This stance is at odds with the position of many [MISC Latin American  ] countries , including those which [LOC Brazil  ] believes should follow its " natural leadership . 
" <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [LOC Brazil  ] has long seen international fora as a way to enhance its international stature . 
Reflecting this , in 2005 it launched failed national candidates for the top jobs at both the [ORG WTO  ] and the [ORG IDB  ] . 
The failure of both , together with the unlikely prospects for a permanent seat in the [ORG UNSC  ] , has widely been seen in [LOC Brazil  ] as a " political " disaster created by a badly designed foreign policy . 
PRESIDENT [PER LULA  ] -------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) President [PER Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  ] was inaugurated in January 2003 after a career as a [LOC Sao Paulo  ] metalworker and labor leader . 
He founded the left-of-center [ORG Workers' Party  ] ( [ORG PT  ] ) in 1980 and lost three presidential campaigns before winning in the October 2002 elections . 
[PER Lula  ] is eligible to run for reelection in October 2006 . 
Elected in large part on promises of promoting an ambitious social agenda , including a " [MISC Zero Hunger  ] " program , [PER Lula  ] 's government has failed to deliver much in this area , as managerial shortcomings and the need for fiscal restraint have limited progress . 
The public 's top concern -- crime and public security -- have not improved under this administration <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) In recent months the [ORG Lula Administration  ] has been beset by a grave political crisis as interlocking influencing peddling/vote-buying scandals linked to important elements of [PER Lula  ] 's [ORG PT  ] party continue to unfold . 
The crisis has placed [PER Lula  ] on the defensive and caused near paralysis in the congress and the executive branch . 
Politics have become dominated by investigations , accusations and revelations . 
The President 's Chief of Staff resigned his post , and he and several other congressmen are the subjects of investigations and expulsion proceedings owing to bribery allegations . 
However , influential Finance Minister [PER Palocci  ] appears entrenched , despite recent corruption allegations against him -- which he has forcefully denied . 
Thus far [MISC Brazilian  ] society -- including the opposition -- seems disinclined to hold [PER Lula  ] personally responsible for the scandals or press for impeachment proceedings . 
However , the breadth of the crisis and the continuing revelations have created a domestic political environment that is fluid and unpredictable . 
Indeed , some rumors link the President directly to the scandal . 
[PER Lula  ] 's popularity has been badly damaged , with recent polls suggesting he could lose his re-election bid should he pursue it in 2006 . 
[LOC MACRO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS  ] --------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) President [PER Lula  ] and his economic team have implemented prudent fiscal and monetary policies and pursued necessary microeconomic reforms . 
As a result , [LOC Brazil  ] 's economy , aided by a benign international environment , is having another solid year . 
GDP growth of 4.9% in 2004 has coupled with booming exports , healthy external accounts , inflation under control , decreasing unemployment and reductions in the debt-to-GDP ratio . 
In recent months , the real has risen sharply against the dollar and the [LOC Sao Paulo Stock Exchange  ] ( [ORG BOVESPA  ] ) has hit record levels . 
In March 2005 , the [MISC Brazilian  ] government declined to renew its [MISC Stand-by Agreement  ] with the [ORG IMF  ] and in mid-July it announced that it would pay early [MISC US$5.12  ] billion in [ORG Standard Reserve Facility  ] payments due by March 2006. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Overall , while [LOC Brazil  ] has made considerable progress , problems remain . 
Despite registering its first year-on-year decline in 2004 , [LOC Brazil  ] 's ( largely domestic ) government debt remains high , at 52% of GDP . 
Real interest rates ( at more than 13 percent ) are among the highest in the world . 
Income and land distribution remain skewed . 
Investment ( including FDI ) is low . 
The country 's sovereign risk ratings are , in general , three to four levels below investment grade . 
And the informal sector constitutes between 35 to 40 percent of the economy , in part because the tax burden ( nearly 38 percent of GDP ) is so high . 
The good new is that , so far , the uncertainty surrounding the political scandal has neither retarded economic growth or frightened away foreign investors. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Sustaining high growth rates in the longer term depends on the impact of President [PER Lula  ] 's structural reform program and efforts to build a more welcoming climate for investment , both domestic and foreign . 
In its first year , the [PER Lula  ] administration passed key tax and pension reforms to improve the government fiscal accounts . 
Judicial reform and an overhaul of the bankruptcy law , which should improve the functioning of credit markets , were passed in late 2004 , along with tax measures to create incentives for long-term savings and investments. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) Public-Private-Partnerships , a key effort to attract private investment to infrastructure , also passed in 2004 , although implementation of this initiative still awaits promulgation of the necessary regulations . 
Labor reform and autonomy for the [ORG Central Bank  ] are on the agenda for 2005 but look increasingly unlikely to be addressed this year . 
Despite this well-considered reform agenda , much remains to be done to improve the regulatory climate for investment , particularly in the energy sector ; to simplify tortuous tax systems at the state and federal levels ; and to further reform the pension system . 
Given the current focus of [ORG Congress  ] on the political scandal , prospects for much of this reform agenda are dim for the remainder of [PER Lula  ] 's term . 
TRADE POLICY ------------ <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) To increase its international profile ( both economically and politically ) , the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] ( [ORG Itamaraty  ] ) is seeking expanded trade ties with developing countries , as well as a strengthening the [MISC Mercosul  ] customs union with [LOC Uruguay  ] , [LOC Paraguay  ] and [LOC Argentina  ] . 
In 2004 , [MISC Mercosul  ] concluded free trade agreements with [LOC Colombia  ] , [LOC Ecuador  ] , [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Peru  ] , adding to its existing agreements with [LOC Chile  ] and [LOC Bolivia  ] to establish a commercial base for the newly-launched [ORG South American Community of Nations  ] . 
This year [MISC Mercosul  ] is pursuing free trade negotiations with [LOC Mexico  ] and [LOC Canada  ] and hopes to be able to resume trade negotiations with the [ORG EU  ] . 
The trade bloc also plans to launch trilateral free trade negotiations with [LOC India  ] and [LOC South Africa  ] , building on partial trade liberalization agreements concluded with these countries in 2004 . 
[LOC China  ] has increased its importance as an export market for [MISC Brazilian  ] soy , iron ore and steel , becoming [LOC Brazil  ] 's fourth largest trading partner and a potential source of investment . 
As many [MISC Brazilian  ] observers have indicated , all this effort is aimed at countries which together represent less than a third of [LOC Brazil  ] 's foreign trade . 
[ORG DOHA AGENDA  ] - [ORG WTO  ] ----------------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [LOC Brazil  ] leads the [MISC G-20  ] group of developing countries that is pressing for agricultural trade reform in the [ORG WTO Doha Development Agenda  ] negotiations . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's assertive leadership of the [MISC G-20  ] was blamed in some quarters for causing the failure of the [ORG WTO Cancun Ministerial  ] in September 2003 . 
Since then , [LOC Brazil  ] has been more constructively engaged in the [MISC Doha Round  ] as a member of the " [MISC Five Interested Parties  ] " informal group , although many of its positions are still at odds with [LOC U.S.  ] interests . 
[LOC Brazil  ] can be expected to maintain its assertive stance in the [LOC Doha Round  ] on agricultural trade reform while taking more defensive postures in the discussions covering industrial products and services . 
FREE TRADE OF THE AMERICAS - [ORG FTAA  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) As indicated above , the [ORG Lula Administration  ] shows no serious interest in pursuing the [ORG FTAA  ] . 
Despite serving as co-chair and having secured in the November 2003 [LOC Miami  ] meeting a new framework for negotiation , [LOC Brazil  ] has shown no inclination to move the process along and has failed to convoke the next [ORG FTAA Ministerial  ] - which is now overdue .
