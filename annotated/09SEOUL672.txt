Yun  ] . 
Reasons 1.4 ( b/d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: The [ORG DPRK  ] 's recent restaffing and expansion of the [ORG National Defense Commission  ] ( [ORG NDC  ] ) and its hostile military rhetoric over the last several months are related to the [ORG DPRK  ] leadership 's " top priority " need to stabilize the [ORG DPRK  ] internally in preparation for succession , according to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] A second priority was to achieve improved Relations with the [LOC United States  ] , which the [ORG DPRK  ] regards as its only potential security guarantor , ironically . 
END SUMMARY. ------------------------------- Military Statements and the [ORG NDC  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In an April 23 meeting , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [ORG Poloff  ] that the [ORG Korean People 's Army  ] 's ( [ORG KPA  ] ) spate of high-level announcements over the past several months ( such as the March 8 [ORG KPA Supreme Command  ] report , the first in 15 years , and the four [ORG KPA General  ] Staff statements since January , not seen since 1999 ) should not be misinterpreted as the [ORG DPRK  ] military asserting control over the country , because the military could act only in concert with the [ORG Worker 's Party  ] and the [ORG Cabinet  ] . 
Instead the " generals appearing on TV " was a phenomenon directed at [ORG DPRK  ] citizens with two goals: to show that the [ORG DPRK  ] 's hostile external situation meant citizens had to pull together , and as a " power display " to send a law-and-order message to counter the increasing economic disorder resulting from decades of economic " depression . 
" There was dissatisfaction among some elite groups in the [ORG DPRK  ] , who knew of economic reform in [LOC China  ] and [LOC Vietnam  ] and wondered why the [ORG DPRK  ] had instead deteriorated . 
To tamp down this internal dissent , external tension was needed . 
The [ORG ROKG  ] was not particularly worried about the specific threats to the [LOC South  ] contained in the statements because they saw the statements as targeted at the domestic audience , and in any case knew the [ORG DPRK  ] would try to achieve surprise if it were to resort to military action , rather than giving warning. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The key factor in the background was 67-year-old [PER Kim Jong-il  ] 's ( [ORG KJI  ] ) waning health . 
After [ORG KJI  ] 's August 2008 stroke , the [ORG DPRK  ] was a " different environment that needed stronger leadership . 
" [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that before the stroke , [ORG KJI  ] was confident that he could rule for years , but afterward he suffered " physical and psychological trauma . 
" [ORG KJI  ] had become obsessed with creating political stability to allow an orderly succession , though [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] did not claim to know who was next in line . 
Immediately after the April 5 missile launch the [ORG Supreme People 's Assembly  ] had declared the beginning of [ORG KJI  ] 's third ruling period . 
But rather than celebrating the renewal of his mandate , [ORG KJI  ] was concentrating on changes that would pave the way for succession. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The most important of these was the enlargement ( from 8 to 13 members ) and strengthening of the [ORG KJI-chaired National Defense Commission  ] ( [ORG NDC  ] ) . 
The [ORG NDC  ] was first established in 1998 with a largely symbolic role , but had since taken on policy and coordination functions . 
Now it had the lead on succession , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believed . 
[ORG KJI  ] brother-in-law [PER Chang Song-taek  ] 's addition to the [ORG NDC  ] was important for succession preparation , not only because he was married to [ORG KJI  ] 's only sibling and close confidante 63-year-old [PER Kim Kyong-hui  ] , but also because [PER Chang  ] was seen as having effectively protected and acted for [ORG KJI  ] during [ORG KJI  ] 's fall 2008 recovery period. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Another key change was the replacement of [ORG National Defense Commission  ] Deputy Chairman [PER Kim Yong-chun  ] with [ORG Oh Kuk-ryul  ] , a 78-year old Kim-family loyalist ( in relative terms , since all senior officials are loyalists ) who [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] thought was consolidating various ROK-surveillance and special operations institutions under his control at [ORG NDC  ] . 
One of these was the [ORG Worker 's Party  ] 's [ORG Operations Department  ] , which [LOC Oh  ] has headed since 1989 . 
( [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also referred to an April 21 [ORG JoongAng Ilbo  ] newspaper article claiming that " Office 35 , " charged with intel collection , and the " [ORG External Liaison Office  ] , " charged with training agents , had both been moved from the [ORG Operations Department  ] to [ORG NDC/KPA  ] control , saying that [ORG ROK  ] intel sources did not think there was evidence of such a move . 
) The [ORG Operations Department  ] , which formulates actions against the [LOC South  ] , was " passive " during the 1999-2007 Sunshine Policy period , but was now becoming more active again . 
In other words , [LOC Oh  ] 's job was to keep the [LOC South  ] off balance and make sure that it did not disrupt the succession period . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he believed that changes to the [ORG DPRK  ] constitution , announced but not yet explained , would also focus on succession-related issues . 
He alluded to frequent [ORG DPRK  ] propaganda aiming for the establishment of a " strong and prosperous " nation by 2012 , saying that [ORG DPRK  ] authorities believed they had already succeeded ideologically and militarily , so they were concentrating on the economic side , which is where the [ORG Kaesong Industrial Complex  ] fit in. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [ORG DPRK  ] 's determination to maintain internal order meant that it could go so far as to engage in " limited armed conflict " with the [ORG ROK  ] . 
At the same time , the [ORG DPRK  ] was well aware that [ORG ROK  ] forces were ready for any provocation and would respond with superior force . 
In addition , the [ORG DPRK  ] knew that combined [MISC ROK-U.S.  ] surveillance capabilities would prevent it from achieving surprise , so [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was reassured that no direct military provocation was imminent. ----------------------- Relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] ----------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Asked what the [ORG ROKG  ] 's policy options were , given the above situation , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] answered indirectly , saying that the main question was [MISC U.S.-DPRK  ] relations . 
Second only to maintaining internal stability to allow for succession was the [ORG DPRK  ] 's determination to improve relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] , because only the [LOC U.S.  ] could solve both the [ORG DPRK  ] 's security and economic problems . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said this push for improved relations was ironic , given [ORG DPRK  ] rhetoric attacking the [LOC U.S.  ] as a menace , but was nevertheless high on [ORG DPRK  ] authorities' agenda . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the [ORG DPRK  ] saw the 1999-2000 rapprochement with the [ORG Clinton Administration  ] as the first , failed , chance for peace with the [LOC U.S.  ] ; that the [PER Bush  ] ( 43 ) [ORG Administration  ] had turned to negotiations too late for substantial progress ; and that the [ORG Obama Administration  ] amounted to a " second chance . 
" The [ORG DPRK  ] craved a dialogue with the [LOC U.S.  ] , aiming for a " big deal , " but first needed to raise tensions to create the need for dialogue. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The scope for inter-Korean relations depended on what happened with [MISC U.S.-DPRK  ] relations . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was convinced that the [ORG DPRK  ] would keep tension high towards the [LOC South  ] , while seeking an opening with the [LOC U.S.  ] Therefore , his recommendation to [ORG ROK  ] policymakers was to stay on an even keel to keep the [LOC South-North  ] situation from deteriorating further . 
The [ORG DPRK  ] 's April 21 proposal for dialogue about land-use and wages at the [ORG Kaesong Industrial Complex  ] was potentially helpful in that regard , but had to be approached carefully , because the [ORG DPRK  ] would try to seize the initiative and lock-in economic benefits without offering reciprocal steps . 
Like other [ORG ROKG  ] officials , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] emphasized the need for continued close [MISC U.S.-ROK  ] coordination on all issues related to [LOC North Korea.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] cautioned that [LOC China  ] would seek to prevent [MISC U.S.-DPRK  ] relations from improving too much , adding with a smile that had it not been for its attitude toward the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC China  ] would have moved to prevent the October 2006 [ORG DPRK  ] nuclear weapon test. ----------- [LOC Mt. Kumgang  ] ----------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) As an aside , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] commented on the July 2008 shooting death of a [MISC South Korean  ] tourist at [PER Mt. Kumgang  ] . 
He said that [ORG KPA  ] soldiers and sentries in the area , after frequent contact with [MISC South Korean  ] tourists , had a tendency to be too relaxed , so [ORG KPA  ] officers periodically conducted exercises to tighten discipline . 
The shooting had occurred during one of those exercise periods .
