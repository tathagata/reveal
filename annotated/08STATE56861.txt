( C ) Summary . 
Senior [LOC U.S.  ] , [MISC Nordic  ] , and [MISC Baltic  ] officials met in [LOC Washington D.C.  ] on April 30th for the eleventh [ORG Enhanced Partnership  ] in [LOC Northern Europe  ] ( e-PINE ) Political Directors' meeting . 
They agreed: that [ORG MAP  ] for [LOC Georgia  ] and [LOC Ukraine  ] in December is desirable , but may be problematic ; that the current situation in [LOC Georgia  ] is cause for concern ; that an orderly transition in [LOC Kosovo  ] is needed ; and that [LOC Belarus  ] should be confronted with a unified message . 
PolDirs agreed that [LOC Moldova  ] should not be forced into neutrality and were hopeful that a 5 2 meeting could occur in the near future . 
They also discussed [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( to which all e-PINE countries contribute either personnel or aid ) , [LOC Cuba  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] , and the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
[LOC Lithuania  ] offered to host the next e-PINE Political Directors' meeting in [LOC Vilnius  ] . 
End Summary. e-PINE: Political Directors' Meetings in [LOC Washington D.C.  ] --------------------------------------------- ---------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Political Directors from the eight [MISC Nordic  ] and [MISC Baltic  ] countries and the [LOC United States  ] met April 30th at the [ORG Department of State  ] to consult and coordinate policies toward [LOC Ukraine  ] , [LOC Moldova  ] , [LOC Belarus  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC Georgia  ] and [LOC Kosovo  ] ( see para 23 for participant list ) . 
The meeting began with a working lunch for delegation leaders only , hosted by [ORG EUR  ] Acting Assistant Secretary [PER Kurt Volker  ] and [ORG EUR  ] DAS [PER Judy Garber  ] . 
The subjects of conversation included [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] , and [LOC Cuba  ] . 
[ORG SCA  ] DAS [PER Patrick Moon  ] spoke on [LOC Afghanistan  ] and S/I Deputy Chat [ORG Blakeman  ] spoke on [LOC Iraq  ] . 
After lunch , the participants continued their discussions , joined by Acting Under Secretary [PER Dan Fried  ] , turning to [LOC Moldova  ] , [LOC Belarus  ] , [LOC Ukraine  ] , [LOC Georgia  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , Energy , the [LOC Middle East  ] , and [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
[LOC Iraq  ] ---- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [MISC Swedish  ] PolDir [PER Bjorn Lyrvall  ] said that at the April 30 GAERC , there was discussion of deliverables for the upcoming [MISC International Compact  ] with [LOC Iraq  ] ( [ORG ICI  ] ) . 
The goals will be to improve the [ORG EU  ] presence and ensure a legal basis for [ORG EU  ] engagement in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
He hoped that there would be progress on elections , hopefully set for October , and on the hydrocarbon law . 
Acting [PER A/S Volker  ] said that improving [MISC European  ] perceptions of the progress in [LOC Iraq  ] would also be an important deliverable . 
Chat [ORG Blakeman  ] noted that economic progress has been made , with [LOC Iraq  ] 's meeting most [ORG IMF  ] targets . 
The [ORG UN  ] role in [LOC Iraq  ] is now robust ; he hoped that the [ORG EU  ] would soon follow suit . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] ----------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [MISC Norwegian  ] PolDir [PER Vegard Ellefsen  ] called for support for [ORG Eide  ] 's mission ; there was agreement that he is the right person for the job . 
[ORG SCA  ] DAS Moon explained that there are three pillars to the [LOC U.S.  ] counterinsurgency strategy: 1 ) military -- separating insurgents and holding the area , including with the [ORG ANA  ] and police ; 2 ) immediate development assistance ; and 3 ) government services provided by [MISC Afghan  ] authorities , which depend on the quality of the local government . 
In the east , roads have been key to success , and we have seen improved security and economic growth . 
In the south , there have been deficiencies in strategy -- not enough development assistance , not enough soldiers to hold , and a need to do better on local government quality . 
All agreed that capacity building is central to progress . 
[LOC France  ] 's increased engagement was noted with approval . 
PolDirs agreed that greater contributions from and inclusion of [MISC Afghans  ] were needed to make the government and police a success. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [MISC Estonian  ] PolDir [PER Aivo Orav  ] and [LOC Denmark  ] 's [PER Liselotte Plesner  ] both mentioned that there is little public opposition to their countries' participation in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
By contrast , although she said [LOC Iceland  ] 's FM is convinced of the need to remain engaged , [MISC Icelandic  ] PolDir [PER Greta Gunnarsdottir  ] confirmed public opposition . 
[LOC Cuba  ] ---- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) AA/S [PER Volker  ] noted that e-PINE countries need to create expectations for change now that [PER Castro  ] is possibly no longer in power . 
All e-PINE countries agree that there is a need for a democratic transition and respect for human rights . 
There will be a review of the [ORG EU  ] Common Position in June to determine whether to lift the 2003 Restrictive measures , which were officially suspended in 2005 . 
[LOC Spain  ] will argue there has been enough progress by [LOC Cuba  ] to drop the measures ; in exchange , the [ORG GOC  ] will agree to engage in a political dialogue with the [ORG EU  ] . 
[PER Volker  ] noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] does not see much progress , only some small steps . 
The prospect of dialogue entrances many in the [ORG EU  ] , but they may not reach consensus on dropping the restrictive measures unless the [MISC Cubans  ] take a few more steps on human rights or economic openness . 
[LOC Ukraine  ] -------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Acting Under Secretary [PER Fried  ] led the discussion , which centered on the [ORG NATO  ] summit and the importance of the statement concerning [ORG MAP  ] for [LOC Ukraine  ] and [LOC Georgia  ] that came out of it . 
[PER Fried  ] noted that the debate over [ORG MAP  ] for [LOC Ukraine  ] goes beyond questions of membership to whether [ORG NATO  ] can embrace [LOC Ukraine  ] as part of the concept of " [LOC Europe  ] . 
" In [LOC Bucharest  ] , [ORG NATO  ] leaders said " not yet " to [MISC Ukrainian  ] membership , but did not close the door to the eventuality . 
All expressed satisfaction with the [LOC Bucharest  ] statement regarding [LOC Georgia  ] and [LOC Ukraine.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Fried  ] added that , domestically , [LOC Ukraine  ] needs to focus on reform , on privatization , and on energy security . 
In less than a month [LOC Ukraine  ] will join the [ORG WTO  ] . 
Although the [MISC Ukrainians  ] have made good progress in a short period of time , they need to pull themselves together ; this will require a great deal of work . 
There was general concern over the state of [MISC Ukrainian  ] domestic politics that may make getting [ORG MAP  ] in December difficult . 
[LOC Denmark  ] 's [PER Plesner  ] , [LOC Latvia  ] 's [PER Peteris Ustubs  ] , [LOC Lithuania  ] 's [PER Vytautas Leskevicius  ] , and [LOC Norway  ] 's [PER Ellefsen  ] noted their support for [LOC Ukraine  ] 's membership in the [ORG EU  ] . 
[MISC Swedish  ] PolDir [PER Lyrvall  ] was also supportive , but argued for " substance over speed . 
" All agreed that the chance of a membership perspective at this time was slim. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Fried  ] concluded that there will most likely be heated debate up to December on [ORG MAP  ] . 
[LOC Ukraine  ] also needs to develop more pro-NATO sentiment internally . 
He expressed the hope that the [ORG EU  ] will keep the door open for [MISC Ukrainian  ] membership until the [MISC Ukrainians  ] are ready to join . 
[LOC Moldova  ] -------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [MISC Latvian  ] PolDir [PER Ustubs  ] explained that , although the domestic situation is a bit difficult , there have been some positive steps indicating that a 5 2 meeting ( [LOC Moldova  ] , [LOC Transnistria  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC Ukraine  ] , [ORG OSCE  ] plus [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG EU  ] as observers ) might be possible in the near future . 
[LOC Moldova  ] is moving down the road towards an enhanced agreement with the [ORG EU  ] and this is a very positive development . 
Participants disagreed over the timing of the agreement , with some preferring to wait until after the elections ; however , [LOC Lithuania  ] 's [PER Leskevicius  ] argued that the agreement should be made ready by October or November . 
[LOC Sweden  ] 's [PER Lyrvall  ] noted that this seemed to be an unrealistic timetable , but that getting a good agreement out of the [ORG EU  ] was something that everyone could support. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Participants noted that [LOC Moldova  ] 's opposition is internally conflicted and may need assistance from e-PINE countries to help it understand the importance of being unified for success in elections. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Acting U/S [PER Fried  ] stressed the importance of [LOC Moldova  ] 's not being forced into neutrality - this is a choice that it must make for itself and is no business of [LOC Russia  ] 's nor that of any other country . 
Additionally , he said that e-PINE countries should work with [PER Voronin  ] , who is carving out a space for [MISC Moldovan  ] sovereignty . 
The mood on both sides of the rivers seems to be changing , and there is a better chance at present for a 5 2 meeting . 
[LOC Georgia  ] -------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Participants agreed that the current situation in [LOC Georgia  ] is of concern . 
There was general agreement that there ought to be some sort of investigation of the [ORG UAV  ] incident , but less agreement as to who should investigate and when . 
[LOC Sweden  ] 's [PER Lyrvall  ] , among others , thought that an [ORG EU  ] expert team would be most credible , while the [MISC Baltic  ] PolDirs argued time was of the essence and a team should be sent as soon as possible before any data/debris were lost . 
There was general concern about [LOC Russia  ] 's " peacekeeper " role since recent actions have demonstrated its lack of neutrality ; it is no longer a mediator and has become party to the conflict . 
There was a general impression that [LOC Russia  ] has been testing the West to see where the " red lines " are and how much will be tolerated . 
Vigorous , united diplomatic resistance is called for , especially from the [MISC Germans  ] . 
Lyrall asked if there were a way to use CIS countries to pressure [LOC Russia  ] on [LOC Georgia  ] . 
He also stressed the importance of a clear message coming from the [ORG EU  ] , noting that the [ORG GAERC  ] meeting at the end of May would offer the opportunity for a strategic conversation on [LOC Georgia.  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) On the domestic front , PolDirs agreed that [LOC Georgia  ] needs to make sure the elections go well and that it does not get a " pass " due to current problems . 
It is more important than ever that [LOC Georgia  ] run democratic elections . 
Acting U/S [PER Fried  ] stressed the importance of a clear [ORG EU  ] position on [LOC Georgia  ] , expressing hope that [ORG EU  ] members hadn't placed the issue in the category of " too much trouble . 
" He noted that [LOC Germany  ] had its own frozen conflict ( i.e. , the division of the country ) when it joined [ORG NATO  ] . 
[PER DAS Bryza  ] noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] had worked with the [MISC Georgians  ] to try to get them to moderate their behavior , while at the same time delivering a clear message to the [MISC Russians  ] that their negative actions will have repercussions. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) At present , participants said , the " Friends " group is losing credibility with [LOC Georgia  ] by talking about small steps . 
In order to re-energize and re-legitimize the group , the Friends should push for a dual agreement involving a promise on the [MISC Georgian  ] side not to use force and a promise on the [LOC Abkhaz  ] side to allow the IDPs to return . 
It is very important to get this right so that the [MISC Russians  ] don't win a victory against the 1994 agreement . 
[LOC Belarus  ] -------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [LOC Finland  ] 's Deputy Director General [PER Anu Laamanen  ] said that the positive developments of the past six months , with the release of a few political prisoners and the message that ( unspecified ) observers will be invited for the elections , appeared to be coming to an end . 
The [ORG EU  ] had renewed its sanctions for another year . 
Unity of message is the key to dealing with [LOC Belarus  ] ; we should not allow [PER Lukashenka  ] to drive wedges or it will limit any chances for success . 
[LOC U.S.  ] sanctions are reversible with good behavior ; it is apparent that rewards for small steps do not work. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) Acting U/S [PER Fried  ] briefed on the current dispute between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Belarus  ] and what it might mean for the [LOC U.S.  ] presence in [LOC Minsk  ] going forward . 
He noted that [LOC U.S.  ] sanctions against [LOC Belarus  ] are tied to its release of political prisoners and to its human rights record . 
Unfortunately , instead of making improvements and releasing prisoners , [LOC Belarus  ] has chosen to put pressure on the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Embassy  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] was reviewing a variety of options regarding its presence in [LOC Minsk  ] and [MISC Belarusian  ] presence in the [LOC United States  ] . 
We need to make sure that [LOC Belarus  ] continues to receive the same message from everyone . 
Energy ------ <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [LOC Lithuania  ] 's [PER Leskevicius  ] noted that energy is an important agenda item across the entire [ORG EU  ] . 
[LOC Russia  ] continues to use energy as a geopolitical tool to reward and punish . 
Political directors were in general agreement that it is important to develop practical solutions that are easy to follow through on . 
The structure of the [ORG EU  ] , and the fact that energy policy remains largely a national issue , create problems for developing a unified energy strategy . 
The main goal of energy policy is to increase competition , not to bring down [ORG Gazprom.  ] <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) The progress being made by the [MISC Baltic  ] littoral countries was noted ; there was a sense of strategic direction . 
[LOC Norway  ] noted that [LOC Europe  ] could not look to increased product the [MISC Shtokman  ] fields in [LOC Russia  ] until the lat part of the next decade . 
PolDirs suggested that , in [LOC Ukraine  ] , e-PINE needs to work with [ORG Gazprom  ] to improve infrastructure , increase capacity , and cut out middlemen so that supplies of gas to and through [LOC Ukraine  ] are cheaper and more reliable . 
[LOC Russia  ] ------ <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) Acting U/S [PER Fried  ] said that the basic strategy of the [LOC U.S.  ] is cooperation where possible and pushback where necessary . 
This strategy does not allow [LOC Russia  ] to create artificial linkages - i.e. , there will be no cooperation on [LOC Iran  ] at the expense of [LOC Georgia  ] . 
The [MISC Russians  ] are difficult partners for the e-PINE countries generally and they are unlikely to become easier with [LOC Russia  ] 's political transition . 
[MISC Swedish  ] participants were in favor of trying to " build up " [PER Medvedev  ] in an effort to drive a wedge between him and [PER Putin  ] . 
The [MISC Norwegians  ] stressed the importance of Allied unity . 
[LOC Kosovo  ] ------- <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) [MISC Estonian  ] [PER PolDir Orav  ] noted the early recognition of [LOC Kosovo  ] by most e-PINE countries . 
Acting U/S [PER Fried  ] noted that there are several positive aspects of the transition , namely the behavior of [LOC Kosovo  ] 's government and the security situation in much of the country . 
However , there are some difficulties in working out the orderly transition from [LOC UNMIK  ] to [LOC EULEX  ] , and [LOC Serbia  ] 's behavior in the north is worrisome . 
[LOC Sweden  ] 's [PER Lyrvall  ] agreed that the transition needs to be sorted out ; while there may be a residual role for [LOC UNMIK  ] , [LOC EULEX  ] needs to take on the major role . 
[LOC Estonia  ] 's [PER Orav  ] also thought that if everything goes well in [LOC Kosovo  ] , the next area of difficulty could well be [LOC Macedonia  ] , on which [ORG NATO  ] unity is important . 
[LOC Middle East  ] ----------- <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) [LOC U.S.  ] Israel-Palestine Deputy Office Director [PER Nicole Shampaine  ] said that negotiations between [LOC Israel  ] and the [MISC Palestinians  ] on permanent status issues are proceeding in secret , that we believe progress is being made in these discussions , and that we continue to hope for an agreement by the end of the year . 
Conditions on the ground for the [MISC Palestinians  ] are bad , however , and this undermines both the current [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] ( [ORG PA  ] ) leadership and political efforts to make progress towards an agreement . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] is urging both parties to implement their Roadmap obligations , which for the [MISC Palestinians  ] means taking steps against terrorism and for [LOC Israel  ] means stopping settlement expansion and removing unauthorized outposts . 
We are also encouraging [LOC Israel  ] to reduce obstacles to movement in the [LOC West Bank  ] ( while still preserving [MISC Israeli  ] security ) in order to make it possible for the [MISC Palestinian  ] economy to develop . 
[PER Shampaine  ] expressed appreciation to [LOC Norway  ] for its leadership of the [ORG Ad Hoc Liaison Committee  ] and to [LOC Sweden  ] for its contributions as a donor nation . 
In [LOC Gaza  ] , conditions are untenable but addressing them is extremely challenging in light of [LOC Hamas' de facto  ] control of the area . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] is encouraging [LOC Israel  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] and the [ORG PA  ] to work together to resolve this issue .
