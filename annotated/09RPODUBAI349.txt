REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] The inclusion of USG public diplomacy programs and [ORG IRPO  ] in a recent indictment read during the second show trial in [LOC Tehran  ] is not a new allegation of [LOC US  ] plotting for the overthrow of the [LOC Islamic Republic  ] . 
Such claims have been made before , most recently in January , and contain many accurate details about the programs , but leap wildly to conclusions of intrigue and far-ranging conspiracies . 
[LOC IRIG  ] responses to our exchange programs have varied , from tacit acceptance to obstruction to arrests and intimidation of participants . 
In the current climate , the inclusion of [LOC US  ] programming in a laundry list of the " usual suspects " is not surprising , but it may reflect heightened suspicions of an embattled leadership . 
With the situation in [LOC Iran  ] so unsettled , we believe it would be prudent for [ORG IRPO  ] to delay any pending exchange programs until there are clearer indications of [LOC IRIG  ] intentions toward the programs and the participants . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On August 15 , [LOC Iran  ] 's [ORG Revolutionary Court  ] held the second trial of defendants arrested following street protests over the results of the presidential election . 
Prosecutors read a 22-page indictment that described a far-flung conspiracy among domestic opposition groups and foreign governments . 
Included in the indictment were direct references to the USG , the [ORG Iran Regional Presence Office  ] and its officers , [ORG VOA  ] , and several NGOs that have worked with the [ORG Department .  ] 
( Note: A copy has been e-mailed to NEA/IR . 
) Round up the Usual Suspects ----------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The indictment alleged , among other things , that [MISC Western  ] powers had sought soft overthrow in the guise of public diplomacy because wars in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] in conjunction with [LOC Iran  ] 's military power had made the military overthrow of the [LOC IRIG  ] impossible . 
Public diplomacy and by extension " soft overthrow " sought to influence attitudes of the [MISC Iranian  ] public toward their government and impose [MISC Western  ] values to bring down the [LOC IRIG  ] . 
Although the indictment accurately described public diplomacy and many of its functions , prosecutors went further in alleging that the aims of the [LOC US  ] public diplomacy program was to create and broaden rifts between the people and [LOC IRIG  ] , to pressure the [MISC Iranian  ] government to change its behavior and to portray [LOC America  ] " as [LOC Iran  ] 's only savior . 
" Participants in [LOC US  ] programs were also intended as sources of information , analyses and intelligence about [LOC Iran  ] , according to the indictment . 
( Note: The indictment also devoted considerable attention to the [ORG British Council  ] , the [MISC British  ] Embassy in [LOC Tehran  ] and [ORG BBC Persian  ] , even more than was directed at us . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The indictment specifically mentioned [ORG IRPO  ] , two previous [ORG IRPO  ] directors and [ORG IRPO  ] 's current deputy director . 
[ORG IRPO  ] is " modeled on the [LOC Riga  ] [ station ] " which was set up to engineer the collapse of the [LOC Soviet Union  ] , according to the indictment , and its goals in [LOC Dubai  ] are to attract the [MISC Iranian  ] elite and convince them to act against the interests of the [LOC Islamic Republic  ] . 
In a description of the [ORG International Visitor Leadership Program  ] ( [ORG IVLP  ] ) run by [ORG IRPO  ] , which included details on visa processing and logistical arrangements , the indictment noted that participants had returned " impressed " by their trips to the [LOC US  ] and often volunteered to help with future exchange groups . 
[MISC Iranian  ] authorities also seemed to have conflated public diplomacy programs with separate democracy programming in describing [LOC US  ] regime overthrow efforts and referred to other [LOC Iran  ] Watcher posts' in [LOC London  ] , [LOC Baku  ] and [LOC Istanbul  ] as being involved in these programs . 
Additionally , [MISC Iranian  ] authorities cited [ORG VOA  ] , the [ORG Department 's Digitial Outreach Team  ] , as well as NGO 's [ORG Meridian House International  ] , the [ORG Aspen Institute and Freedom House  ] as having some part in trying to undermine the [LOC Islamic Republic.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [LOC IRIG  ] has accused [ORG IRPO  ] of being the instrument of regime change before . 
Semi-official and IRGC-affiliated [ORG Fars News  ] published an interview with an unnamed counterintelligence official in January that was nearly identical to the details in the indictment . 
These details have most likely been gleaned [ORG IVLP  ] participants , who have either provided them in seeking permission from their employers to participate , and we believe DUBAI 00000349 002.2 OF 003 that often this information is relayed to various security agencies , or during interviews conducted by security officers in [LOC Iran  ] upon their return. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) This latest accusation also follows [LOC IRIG  ] arrests of [MISC AIDS  ] researchers , [PER Arash  ] and [PER Kamiyar Alaei  ] , documentary filmmaker [PER Mohammad Ehseni  ] , and [PER Sylva Hartounian  ] , an employee of [LOC IREX  ] , in <a id='par2008' href='#par2008'>¶</a>2008 . 
[PER Arash Alaei  ] and [PER Ehseni  ] were alumni of [ORG IRPO  ] IVLPs , while [PER Hartounian  ] was working on a maternal and child health exchange . 
Another [ORG IVLP  ] participant was subsequently harassed so much by [MISC Iranian  ] intelligence that she fled the country , as she was no longer able to lead a normal life . 
Another former [ORG IVLP  ] participant fled [LOC Iran  ] , and was subsequently resettled in the [LOC US  ] , after learning he was targeted for arrest . 
Other participants have had their passports seized and were temporarily banned from traveling outside [LOC Iran  ] . 
During fall 2008 , [MISC Iranian  ] authorities obstructed four [ORG IVLP  ] programs by intimidating or threatening participants so that they withdrew from the programs ( reftel ) . 
A Change in Attitude --------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) In May , however , we heard from [ORG IVLP  ] participants and separately through a contact with access to [LOC IRIG  ] sources that the [LOC IRIG  ] had no opposition to these programs . 
Arriving in [LOC Dubai  ] to receive their visas , participants in three programs conducted over the summer told us that they had experienced no trouble or harassment from the [LOC IRIG  ] and were enthusiastic over the possibility of developing working relationships with their [MISC American  ] counterparts . 
These programs proceeded without problems , even during the election and its aftermath , except two folk musicians sought asylum in the [LOC US  ] rather than return to [LOC Iran  ] . 
Comment ---------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The inclusion of our [ORG IVLP  ] programs and [ORG IRPO  ] in the indictment are supporting pieces of the [LOC IRIG  ] 's larger objective of presenting election unrest as a product of a sweeping conspiracy . 
They are convenient " evidence " of a [LOC US  ] bent on " velvet revolution , " and some elements within the [LOC IRIG  ] -- most likely in the [LOC IRGC  ] -- believe in such a plot , or see the utility in using them to foster such belief . 
At a minimum their inclusion serves as a warning to reformists and others who would be more open to better relations with the [LOC US  ] at a time when the regime is under pressure from within . 
At the same time , there are factions within the [LOC IRIG  ] who understand the true nature of these exchange programs . 
We have heard that there are those within the [LOC IRIG  ] , specifically in the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] , [ORG Ministry of Education , Ministry of Health  ] , and even the [ORG Ministry of Intelligence and Security  ] , who have been supportive of these programs or at least had no objection to them in the past . 
Our success in bringing nearly 250 [MISC Iranians  ] to the [LOC US  ] , including those who traveled this summer during the election , indicates that there have been conscious decisions by the [LOC IRIG  ] to allow the programs to go forward , perhaps as a sign of [MISC Iranian  ] interest in better relations . 
It appears , however , that after the election those who see them as a threat are again dictating the [MISC Iranian  ] response. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) By the [MISC Iranians'  ] own admission in the indictment , these exchange programs have been successful in their stated goals , and we believe public and cultural diplomacy continue to provide opportunities for engaging the [MISC Iranian  ] people and even some segments of the [LOC IRIG  ] . 
In the event relations improve in the future , these activities can be one of the most immediate ways we could advance a bilateral relationship. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Amid the current raised suspicions and flux within the [LOC IRIG  ] , however , we should be cautious in proceeding with further exchanges out of concern for the safety of the participants . 
There are real risks involved to anyone thought to be serving [LOC DUBAI  ] 00000349 003.2 OF 003 USG interests , and we think that right now , the risks have risen substantially in the current atmosphere . 
With the situation in [LOC Iran  ] so unsettled , we believe it would be prudent to delay any pending [ORG IVLP  ] exchange programs until there are clearer indications of [LOC IRIG  ] intentions toward them . 
( NOTE: To insulate our public diplomacy programs and maintain [ORG IRPO  ] 's low profile , [ORG IRPO  ] has had no involvement in civil society and democracy programs run by the [ORG Department .  ] 
Our recommendation only extends to [ORG IVLP  ] exchange programs .
