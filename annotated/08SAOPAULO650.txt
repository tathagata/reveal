( U ) Summary: At the Government of [LOC Brazil  ] 's ( [ORG GOB  ] ) much anticipated [ORG International Conference  ] on Biofuels held in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] from November 17 to 21 , [ORG GOB  ] reps , for the most part , stuck to the spirit of the [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] biofuels MOU and kept to promises to remain united with the [LOC U.S.  ] on expanding ethanol markets , focusing on bilateral cooperative efforts and downplaying our differences over the ethanol tariff . 
In contrast , [LOC Sao Paulo  ] state governor [PER Jose Serra  ] criticized [LOC U.S.  ] ethanol production in both his opening and closing remarks , using the occasion to lambaste [LOC U.S.  ] trade policy and the higher production costs of corn ethanol . 
He also made the charge that the [LOC U.S.  ] is actually obstructing the creation of a global biofuels market . 
Governor [PER Serra  ] may have been showing an economic nationalist streak or merely taking the opportunity to curry favor with his constituents in a lead up to his expected Presidential bid in 2010 . 
[ORG GOB  ] officials meanwhile took pains to remind the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation that [PER Serra  ] did not speak for the [LOC Brazilin  ] government . 
There were many [MISC Brazilian  ] non-governmental participants whose comments are not characterized in this cable but will be addressed more specifically in further conference reporting . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) The [ORG GOB  ] had criticized [LOC U.S.  ] ethanol production during the food vs. fuel debate earlier this year . 
However , since the [ORG Food and Agriculture Organization  ] 's meeting in [LOC Rome  ] when President [PER Lula  ] famously differentiated between good and bad ethanol , [ORG GOB  ] reps have consistently told [MISC Mission  ] contacts that [MISC Brazilian  ] government strategy was not to differentiate sugar from corn ethanol . 
( [ORG Note: Ministry of Foreign Relations  ] officials had assured Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] the speech was the work of errant speech writers whose focus was more agricultural than energy and would not be repeated . 
End Note . 
) Instead , they chose to line up with the [LOC U.S.  ] in countering ethanol critics and work with [LOC Washington  ] to create a global marketplace for ethanol. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Andre Correa  ] do [ORG Lago , Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Assistant Secretary-equivalent for Energy  ] , has on multiple occasions told Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] and visiting [LOC U.S.  ] delegations that it is not in [LOC Brazil  ] 's interest to differentiate between types of ethanol , as doing so would only hamper efforts to develop a worldwide market in biofuels . 
Under Secretary for Energy and Science [PER Andre Amado  ] went further , suggesting to the Ambassador and others that the campaigns against biofuels and differentiating feed stocks were the result of orchestrated efforts by entrenched industrial interests. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Indeed , [ORG GOB  ] conference panelists and invited speakers , including Energy Minister [PER Edison Lobao  ] and Presidential Chief of Staff [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] ( likely opponent of [PER Serra  ] 's in a 2010 presidential bid ) , by and large adhered to the message that common efforts to develop the world ethanol market would be good for both [LOC Brazil  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] , with [PER Rousseff  ] particularly highlighting the cooperation between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] in developing biofuels industries in developing countries . 
Both highlighted the virtues of ethanol , limiting discussion about the differences among types of ethanol production . 
In Minister [PER Lobao  ] 's closing speech , he countered several common criticisms of ethanol , stating that fertilizers were the largest contributor to food price inflation and that ethanol had less environmental impact than fossil fuels .

End Note . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) President [PER Lula  ] himself avoid any repeats of past unfortunate comments differentiating types of ethanol and instead focused on the importance , particularly in times of global economic crisis , of developing a global markets for biofuels . 
He said that [LOC Brazil  ] doesn't want the [LOC U.S.  ] or [LOC Europe  ] to stop producing their respective biofuels products , and only asks that they work to bring biofuels industry to developing countries as well . 
He voiced his willingness to work with any country that wanted to transform the life of the people and create income . 
[PER Lula  ] also echoed some of the themes of [LOC Lobo  ] 's speech , countering past claims that biofuels were to blame for the food crisis . 
( [ORG Note: Though  ] he stayed positive on biofuels , [ORG SAO PAULO  ] 00000650 002 OF 003 in discussing climate change and biofuels' role in addressing it , [PER Lula  ] did highlight statistics showing the [LOC U.S.  ] as the largest greenhouse gas emitting country in the world .

( U ) Governor [PER Serra  ] , in contrast , was extremely critical of [LOC U.S.  ] ethanol , along with [LOC U.S.  ] trade policy , and underscored the differences between [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Brazilian  ] ethanol during both his opening and closing remarks to the conference . 
In his conference keynote , [PER Serra  ] boasted about [LOC Brazil  ] 's energy matrix , citing [LOC Brazil  ] as the " greenist " industrialized country with 48 percent share of its energy generated from renewable sources . 
He went on to point out that 15 percent of [LOC Brazil  ] 's energy is derived from sugarcane , highlighting ethanol for automobile fuel as the primary driver . 
[PER Serra  ] further identified the state of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] as the major producer of ethanol . 
Sixty percent of [LOC Brazil  ] 's sugar production and two-thirds of the country 's ethanol for export are produced in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] . 
[PER Serra  ] noted that [LOC Sao Paulo  ] was working toward the total elimination of the manual sugarcane harvest , which requires burning the fields after harvest , and also touted the state 's investments and research endeavors into biofuels. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) In both speeches , [PER Serra  ] distinguished [MISC Brazilian  ] ethanol from other sources , paying particular attention to [LOC U.S.  ] ethanol . 
[PER Serra  ] stated that [LOC U.S.  ] ethanol is less efficient and blamed worldwide food price inflation on [LOC U.S.  ] corn ethanol . 
He said that [LOC U.S.  ] corn-based ethanol production was " much more costly , and that it was largely responsible for the recent period of high inflation because of higher corn prices . 
" [PER Serra  ] added that [MISC Brazilian  ] sugarcane ethanol did not compete with food production and that it was the cheapest feed stock . 
He noted that second generation cellulosic ethanol production would not erase the production cost benefit of [MISC Brazilian  ] ethanol. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) [PER Serra  ] emphasized that [LOC U.S.  ] policies obstruct the existence of a global biofuels market and indentified the [LOC United States  ] as the most protectionist developed country . 
He said the " [LOC U.S.  ] preaches but does not practice " free trade . 
[PER Serra  ] told the high level delegation at the closing ceremony that the [LOC U.S.  ] tariff of 14 cents per liter against imported ethanol was only one of many non-tariff obstacles to entry into the [LOC U.S.  ] market . 
He said domestic subsidies increased the effective tariff to 30 cents per liter , the rough equivalent to the production cost of [MISC Brazilian  ] sugarcane ethanol . 
According to [PER Serra  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] had to establish these types of regimes to protect the market for the less efficient corn-based ethanol. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) Finally , [PER Serra  ] said that [LOC Brazil  ] should help other countries develop ethanol markets in order to expand the ethanol supply needed to develop a global market . 
He highlighted the investment and technical assistance that the [ORG GOB  ] had been doing in third countries . 
[PER Serra  ] failed to mention that such programs are a key part of the [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] [ORG MOU  ] , which established third country assistance. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: Governor [PER Serra  ] 's attack on [LOC U.S.  ] ethanol likely reflects his positioning of himself for the 2010 presidential election . 
[PER Serra  ] is staking out his credentials as a green economic nationalist , an identity that could play well as the global financial crisis hits [LOC Brazil  ] and puts pressure on the [PER Lula  ] administration to respond . 
[PER Serra  ] has been very proactive in recent weeks in demonstrating his efforts to strengthen various entities of the state of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] against the financial crisis . 
[ORG GOB  ] contacts at the conference admitted to [LOC U.S.  ] delegation members that they were embarrassed by [PER Serra  ] 's attacks on the [LOC U.S.  ] One of the organizers lamented that [PER Serra  ] " just didn't get the point of the conference . 
" Multiple [ORG GOB  ] representatives took pains to remind the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation that [PER Serra  ] did not speak for the government . 
Based on these reactions and [ORG GOB  ] actions and rhetoric both in advance of and during the conference , it appears that , despite nationalistic rhetoric from some quarters , the [ORG GOB  ] intends to stick to its message: that biofuels are better than oil , a global market is essential for this quick and clean alternative to flourish , and wealthier nations must assist developing nations in taking advantage of the opportunities presented by biofuels . 
Post will continue to work with the [ORG GOB  ] to advance our mutual efforts in this direction and will seek opportunities to counter [PER Serra  ] 's nationalist drift with more accurate information about the [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] energy [LOC SAO PAULO  ] 00000650 003 OF 003 partnership . 
The ethanol tariff will continue to be an irritant in bilateral relations as long as it remains in place , but overall cooperation in the biofuels arena is still a highlight of the bilateral relationship and offers great opportunities for continued positive engagement. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) COMMENT CONTINUED - BIO NOTE . 
Most observers expect Governor [PER Serra  ] to be the center-right [ORG PSDB  ] candidate for the 2010 Presidential election . 
He likely will square off against President [PER Lula  ] 's preferred successor , Chief of Staff [PER Dilma Roussef  ] . 
[PER Lula  ] , who came into office billed as a [ORG Workers Party  ] ( [ORG PT  ] ) leftist , has shown a pragmatic streak , particularly on macroeconomic issues . 
[PER Serra  ] , although leader of a party considerably to the right of the [ORG PT  ] , is himself seen to have leftist tendencies , some undoubtedly honed in his period of political exile from [LOC Brazil  ] during the military dictatorship . 
His comments last week on trade and biofuels are a case in point . 
While often critical of the [LOC U.S.  ] , [PER Serra  ] is not anti-American , and is an effective administrator willing to work with us on issues of mutual interest and concern .
