The majority of [MISC Podravka’s  ] board are under arrest . 
Prosecutors are seeking information from [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , who provided [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] to the [ORG Podravka  ] management board .

End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Croatia’s Chief State Prosecutor [PER Mladen Bajic  ] met with [ORG RSO  ] and Poloff on February 2 to outline the prosecutor’s “Operation Spice” investigation into [ORG Podravka  ] and former Deputy Prime Minister [PER Polancec  ] . 
[PER Bajic  ] presented two documents . 
The first was an unsigned financing agreement between [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [ORG Podravka  ] from November 2006 . 
The second was a completed financing agreement between a company called [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and from [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] which was secured by [ORG Podravka  ] shares . 
[PER Bajic  ] said that under the equity acquisition financing agreement , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] approximately 34 million euro ( with an additional 39 million euro available in a second tranche ) for purchase of nearly 600,000 ordinary shares of [ORG Podravka  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [PER Bajic  ] said [MISC Podravka’s  ] management , under a plan spearheaded by [PER Polancec  ] , had arranged the deal in order to use the proceeds to purchase a controlling interest in the company . 
( [ORG NOTE: Four  ] members of [MISC Podravka’s  ] former management board are currently in detention . 
The board , which is appointed by parliament , was composed of members supported by various parties within the ruling coalition . 
End Note . 
) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] replaced an unnamed “Podravka Management Approved Holding Company” as the borrower of record. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Prosecutors from the [ORG Office of Suppression of Corruption  ] and [ORG Organized Crime  ] ( [ORG USKOK  ] ) are interested in learning the details of [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , including who approached [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ( [ORG NOTE: Post  ] forwarded copies of the XXXXXXXXXXXXagreements to the [ORG FBI  ] office in [LOC Vienna  ] on February 8 . 
End Note . 
) [PER Bajic  ] told EmbOffs that the [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] agreement is legal -- his interest is in learning who was involved on the [MISC Croatian  ] side . 
According to prosecutors , the criminal aspects of the deal involveXXXXXXXXXXXX and actions taken by [PER Polancec  ] and others in order to [MISC XXXXXXXXXXXX.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Due to the economic crisis , the value of [ORG Podravka  ] shares fell more than 50 percent , from approximately 600 kuna ( 120 USD ) per share [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
According to prosecutors , as the value decreased , [ORG Podravka  ] management , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] had to meet margin calls for the shortfall . 
In one scheme to increase [MISC Podravka’s  ] revenues , at least on paper , [PER Bajic  ] said the management engaged in money laundering by funneling [ORG Podravka  ] money [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] in order to pay fraudulent contracts with [LOC Podravka.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) While Polancec’s scheme at [ORG Podravka  ] was unraveling , he was simultaneously involved in negotiations with [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] END NOTE . 
) [MISC Hungarian  ] prosecutors forwarded to [PER Bajic  ] their report on an investigation of [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] in the [ORG Podravka  ] deal . 
According to the report , when the [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] of the equity agreement dropped to 35 percent in December 2008 , it triggered an early termination agreement . 
[MISC Hungarian  ] prosecutors say that at this point , Deputy Prime Minister [PER Polancec  ] , who was also Minister of Economy and deeply involved in the [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] negotiations , approached [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and asked [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] to be a consultant to [ORG Podravka  ] . 
As a result of these consultations , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] for his failed schemes at [LOC Podravka.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Press reports on the [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] connection to the [ORG Podravka  ] case within the past week have also speculated on the possible involvement of former Prime Minister [PER Ivo Sanader  ] . 
[PER Sanader  ] was closely involved in [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] negotiations and it would have been difficult for [PER Polancec  ] to have taken some of the actions prosecutors are alleging he did in the [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] talks without Sanader’s knowledge . 
[PER Bajic  ] declined to tell us on February 2 whether [PER Sanader  ] is a target of this investigation , but he has told us on previous occasions that his office is investigating the former PM in several cases. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Bajic  ] has said privately that [ORG Podravka  ] could be Croatia’s [ORG Enron  ] , a game-changing case in the GoC’s efforts to tackle corruption , particularly if he can obtain sufficient evidence that [PER Polancec  ] intentionally undersold [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
Cooperation with [MISC Hungarian  ] prosecutors continues to improve . 
[PER Bajic  ] said he was very impressed with the evidence and analysis the [MISC Hungarians  ] provided on the [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] connection. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [MISC COMMENT:  ] The [ORG Podravka  ] case is one of the major cases that the [ORG EU  ] is watching to determine Croatia’s commitment to fighting corruption . 
The results to date are positive . 
The willingness and ability of [ORG USKOK  ] to investigate an incumbent Deputy Prime Minister , almost immediately after suspicions were raised , shows that , as Prime Minister [PER Kosor  ] has contended , there may no longer be “untouchables” in [LOC Croatia  ] . 
Post will continue to work with the [ORG FBI  ] in order to facilitate USKOK’s contact with [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
END COMMENT .
