( [ORG S  ] ) Reftel requests that post " evaluate and provide guidance on the following issues: ( 1 ) Does the [ORG USG  ] provide assistance ( funding , intelligence , information , equipment , training , or otherwise ) to the [ORG GOB  ] that could be used to locate , identify , track , or intercept a civil aircraft ? ( 2 ) Do any [ORG USG  ] entities ( corporations or individuals ) provide assistance ( funding , intelligence , information , equipment , training , or otherwise ) to the [ORG GOB  ] that could be used to locate , identify , track , or intercept a civil aircraft ? 
" Post is not able to identify [ORG USG  ] assistance specifically being used to help [LOC Brazil  ] locate , track , identify or intercept civilian aircraft . 
[ORG DEA  ] and INL assist [MISC Brazilian  ] counter narcotics efforts but do not have determinations from their headquarters as to which , if any , of their programs might be affected . 
According to agency repesentatives in [LOC Brasilia  ] , [LOC DoD  ] and the intel community do provide some information to [LOC Brazil  ] on potential drug traffic which would likely be restricted without certification. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Post 's views on the importance of recertification will be reported septel . 
While the specific effects of non-certification are a matter for [LOC Washington  ] agencies and their legal advisors to determine , post believes that failing to provide information to [MISC Brazilian  ] authorities would increase the flow of illegal drugs through [LOC Brazil  ] . 
It would also result in negative political fallout that would be contrary to overall [ORG USG  ] policy of pursuing closer cooperation with [LOC Brazil  ] , particularly in the areas of counter narcotics and regional security .
