STATE 12713 Classified By: DCM [PER Hugo Llorens  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) & ( d ) . 
( C ) As part of a broader discussion on February 1 ( ref A ) , DCM presented MFA Political Director [PER Rafael Dezcallar  ] with ref B points on [ORG USG  ] concerns with [ORG Shell  ] and [ORG Repsol  ] 's proposed LNG project in [LOC Iran  ] . 
DCM noted the [MISC Iran-related  ] visits of [ORG Treasury DepSec Kimmit  ] and Ambassador [PER Schulte  ] and the recent [MISC Moratinos-Secretary  ] conversation in which the [ORG USG  ] and [ORG GOS  ] had agreed on the importance of a united front on [LOC Iran  ] . 
He said that in this context , [LOC Washington  ] would be concerned by the news that [MISC Spanish  ] firm [ORG Repsol  ] would be investing in [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Dezcallar  ] said that the [ORG GOS  ] had already had a frank discussion with [ORG Repsol  ] to make [ORG Repsol  ] aware of the issues involved and the potential consequences if the investment went forward . 
[PER Dezcallar  ] mentioned that no deal was imminent and no final decision was required of the [MISC Shell-Repsol  ] consortium until early 2008 , implying there was considerable time to kill the initiative . 
He also said that it is important to use a balanced approach to [LOC Iran  ] in order to maintain the broad support for [ORG UNSCR  ] 1737 . 
Embassy plans to follow up directly with [ORG Repsol  ] as well as with other parts of the [ORG GOS  ] .
