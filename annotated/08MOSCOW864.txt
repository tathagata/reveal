[LOC MOSCOW  ] 816 B. [LOC MOSCOW  ] 768 C. 07 [LOC MOSCOW  ] 3054 Classified By: Ambassador [PER William J. Burns  ] for Reasons 1.4 ( b/d ) ------- SUMMARY ------- 1 . 
( C ) The backdrop to last week 's raid on [ORG TNK-BP  ] is a tale of intrigues inside intrigues with speculation running rampant over who is behind the attacks and why . 
We may never know but our best guess is that it is ultimately a commercial struggle for control and ownership of a highly productive asset . 
That struggle has been on-going for some time and has two main threads . 
The first is the desire on the part of some of the [MISC Russian  ] partners , billionaires all , to exercise greater control , and derive more of the profits , than [ORG BP  ] . 
The second is the [ORG GOR  ] 's desire that [ORG Gazprom  ] purchase the [MISC Russian  ] half of the company -- [ORG Gazprom  ] , naturally , wants a lower price , the [MISC Russian  ] billionaires , if they have to sell , want a high price . 
Others see political motives and the chance to take a slap at the [MISC British  ] as well . 
However , ultimately this is a story about billions and billions of dollars . 
End Summary ------------------- BILLIONAIRES VS . 
[ORG BP  ] ------------------- 2 . 
( C ) Various theories have been circulating among the oil and gas community as well as in the local press as to the motives behind the recent attacks ( refs A and B ) on [ORG TNK-BP  ] , one of the world 's ten largest oil companies . 
Prominent among these theories is in-fighting among the shareholders , especially between [ORG BP  ] and its [MISC Russian  ] billionaire partners . 
The [ORG TNK  ] half of [ORG TNK-BP  ] is shared between billionaires [PER Viktor Vekselberg  ] ( [MISC Renova  ] company - 12.5 percent ) , [PER Mikhail Fridman  ] , [MISC German  ] [PER Khan  ] and [PER Peter Aven  ] ( [ORG Alfa Group  ] -- 12.5 , 11 , and 1.5 percent ) and ( Amcit ) [PER Lev Blavatnik  ] ( [ORG Access Industries  ] -- 12.5 percent ) . 
The [MISC Russian  ] billionaires , especially those from [ORG Alfa  ] , are feuding with [ORG BP  ] in a spat that goes back years . 
As one [ORG BP  ] official told us when the company was forming , " We have a love-hate relationship . 
They love us ( our money ) , and we hate them ( their corporate governance and management styles ) . 
" 3 . 
( C ) According to a western [ORG TNK-BP  ] official , the raids should be seen as the latest in this multi-year attempt to drive out or scare away the foreign managers of the company , which made nearly $9 billion in profits last year . 
[PER Khan  ] has traditionally led the charge to get rid of the western managers who have brought to the company western business practices such as accountable corporate governance , transparency , and fiscal discipline . 
In particular , senior western [ORG TNK-BP  ] executives have pointed to the company 's procurement as a sore point for [PER Khan  ] and to a lesser extent the other billionaires . 
[ORG TNK-BP  ] spends several billion dollars a year on equipment and supplies . 
The [ORG BP  ] half of [ORG TNK-BP  ] has been able to limit directed purchases and kick-backs , much to the chagrin of some of their business partners . 
The former [ORG BP  ] officials in the company also point to a contentious board meeting last fall at [PER Fridman  ] 's Chateau in the south of [LOC France  ] . 
When their prediction that declining investment would lead to falling production and profits proved prescient , the [ORG Alfa  ] partners in particular used this to argue for a change in senior management . 
4 . 
( C ) Threatening the visa status of the western employees in the company has been a favorite tactic xxxxxxxxxxxx These efforts appear to have culminated in a March 25 announcement that 148 of the [ORG BP  ] employees seconded to [ORG TNK-BP  ] would have to temporarily be removed from the company while their visa status is clarified. xxxxxxxxxxxx 5 . 
( C ) Adding another wrinkle to the in-fighting between the billionaires and [ORG BP  ] is that the billionaires quarrel among themselves as well . 
The [ORG BP  ] managers have a much better relationship with [PER Vekselberg  ] and [PER Blavatnik  ] . 
They regard [PER Vekselberg  ] as a serious businessman and one whom they hoped would be able to buy out the other [MISC Russian  ] partners . 
[PER Blavatnik  ] has a limited operational role in the company , reducing scope for friction . 
The [ORG BP  ] managers tell us that talk of one partner or another buying out the others has been going on for some time. ------------------------------------- [ORG GAZPROM  ] TRYING TO SAVE A FEW BILLION ? ------------------------------------- 6 . 
( C ) The other widely circulated theory behind the [ORG FSB  ] raid on [ORG TNK-BP  ] is that it is an attempt by [ORG Gazprom  ] to knock down the billionaires' price . 
[ORG Gazprom  ] and the [ORG TNK  ] half of [ORG TNK-BP  ] have reportedly been negotiating for months over a price for the [MISC Russian  ] half of the company . 
When [ORG TNK-BP  ] was formed in 2003 , the agreement stipulated that the [MISC Russian  ] partners would not sell their shares until January 1 , 2007 , a date which was subsequently pushed back a year . 
Over the past six months , the western managers at [ORG TNK-BP  ] have told us that the [ORG GOR  ] would prefer to buy out the billionaires and bring the company more fully under state control . 
Moreover , they have told us that although [ORG Rosneft  ] was mentioned early on as a potential partner , the [ORG GOR  ] apparently decided that only [ORG Gazprom  ] would be allowed to purchase the [MISC Russian  ] half of the company . 
7 . 
( C ) On the whole , [ORG BP  ] is sanguine about this prospect . 
In their view , [ORG Gazprom  ] would likely make a more reliable and predictable partner . 
The negotiations over the [ORG Kovykta  ] gas field ( ref C ) led to [MISC Gazprom-BP  ] negotiations over a global strategic tie-up that in turn puts the potential partnership in [ORG TNK-BP  ] in a positive light . 
The most likely model would be the [ORG Sakhalin Energy Investment Corporation  ] ( [ORG SEIC  ] ) . 
Although [ORG Shell  ] was pressured into selling a majority share to [ORG Gazprom  ] , it has been left to operate the company more or less as it sees fit . 
That said , [PER Vladimir Konavalov  ] , the head of the [ORG Petroleum Advisory Forum  ] , told us it is possible that [ORG Gazprom  ] may nonetheless want to reduce [ORG BP  ] to a minority share in the company . 
A western [ORG TNK-BP  ] official told us [ORG BP  ] can live with this and that there is already a side deal in place once the purchase happens that would give [ORG Gazprom  ] 50 percent plus one of the shares . 
8 . 
( C ) The [MISC Russian  ] billionaires on the other hand are not at all happy at the prospect of being forced to sell their shares and if push comes to shove they are determined to get the best price they can . 
[PER Vladimir Milov  ] , a former Deputy Energy Minister , told us that the [ORG GOR  ] would prefer to avoid any hint of the [ORG Yukos  ] affair in resolving [ORG TNK-BP  ] 's ownership . 
If the billionaires are forced to sell , they will get " market value . 
" The question is who determines that market value ? 
It will not be the market . 
However , it will not be [ORG Gazprom  ] either . 
The billionaires have connections , influence , and above all cash with which to fight . 
One of the senior western [ORG TNK-BP  ] executives told us recently that he was surprised the fight had gone on as long as it had and that it was apparent they had underestimated the billionaires . 
In particular , this official noted , the [ORG Alfa Group  ] 's [PER Peter Aven  ] appears to have considerable influence in the [LOC Kremlin  ] . 
This official also noted that [ORG Gazprom  ] is only interested in the whole of the [MISC Russian  ] half , giving any of the billionaires an effective veto over the sale by , for instance , fomenting continuing uncertainty , as the [ORG Alfa Group  ] may have done with these latest attacks . 
9 . 
( C ) [PER Vekselberg  ] threw down the price gauntlet by publicly valuing the company at $60 billion late last year . 
This is not an arbitrary sum . 
The western executives at [ORG TNK-BP  ] have told us that extrapolating from the small amount of shares currently traded publicly undervalues the company and that based on its reserves , production , and profits , [PER Vekselberg  ] 's figure is close to the mark . 
The difference is considerable . 
However , based on those publicly traded shares ( less than 3 [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00000864 003 OF 004 percent of the total ) the current market capitalization of the company is $27 billion , having dropped 10 percent following the raid . 
Depending on which valuation is used , [ORG Gazprom  ] would have to pay either $3.5 or 7.5 billion dollars for each 12.5 percent stake , reason enough to fight . 
10 . 
( C ) Adding grist to the theory that [ORG Gazprom  ] is behind the investigation is the fact that under [MISC Russian  ] law , it is the target of industrial espionage that must initiate the investigation by filing a complaint . 
[ORG Gazprom  ] was almost certainly aware of [ORG TNK-BP  ] 's " [ORG Gazprom  ] project " assessing it as a potential partner and may have chosen to use this to put pressure on the billionaires . 
Seen in this light , actions such as Mitvol 's environmental review ( ref A ) are seen by many as part of a coordinated attack on the company to reduce its value and induce the sale of its [MISC Russian  ] half. -------------------- [MISC KREMLIN IN-FIGHTING  ] ? -------------------- 11 . 
( C ) No conspiracy theory in today 's [LOC Russia  ] would be complete without some reference to the power struggle within the [LOC Kremlin  ] , particularly in light of the impending change at the top . 
In a March 25 meeting , [PER Ekho Moskvy  ] Editor [PER Aleksey Venediktov  ] called the action by the [ORG FSB  ] a warning shot to [PER Medvedev  ] . 
He speculated that very involvement of the [ORG FSB  ] as evidence that the actions were tied to [ORG FSB  ] Chief [PER Patrushev  ] and through him to [ORG Presidential Administration Deputy Sechin  ] , s maneuvering during this political transition . 
Many Embassy contacts have in fact predicted a loss of influence for [LOC Sechin  ] following the transition . 
Creating a scandal over [ORG TNK-BP  ] could be a means for [LOC Sechin  ] and his supporters to remind the President-elect of their ability to wreak political havoc . 
If such a scandal disrupts business dealings between [ORG Gazprom  ] -- the rival to the siloviki-dominated [ORG Rosneft  ] state oil company ( which [LOC Sechin  ] chairs ) -- and [MISC Western  ] partners , so much the better . 
12 . 
( C ) There are , however , reasons to discount this theory . 
As we noted above , [ORG BP  ] has told us that [ORG Rosneft  ] is no longer a serious potential purchaser of the [MISC Russian  ] half of [ORG TNK-BP  ] . 
A senior western executive at [ORG Rosneft  ] told us the same thing . 
In addition , many of the contacts with whom we discussed [ORG TNK-BP  ] developments pointed out that [ORG FSB  ] involvement isn't conclusive one way or the other . 
Any of the players in this game could have access to the [ORG FSB  ] , including [ORG Gazprom  ] and the [ORG Alfa Group.  ] ------------------- A JAB AT THE [MISC BRITS  ] ? ------------------- 13 . 
( C ) Given abysmal [MISC Russian-British  ] bilateral relations , the press and some of our [MISC British  ] counterparts , were quick to see an [ORG FSB  ] raid on the highest profile [MISC British  ] investment here as a politically motivated attack against the [MISC Brits  ] . 
[PER Ilya  ] and [PER Alexander Zaslavsky  ] , the two brothers who were arrested in connection with the [ORG FSB  ] 's charges of " commercial espionage " were , respectively , heads of the [LOC Oxford-Cambridge  ] and the [ORG British Council  ] alumni associations . 
These linkages were widely publicized and embraced by many media outlets as being related to the raid on [ORG TNK-BP  ] and [ORG BP  ] offices . 
14 . 
( C ) However , despite the prominent attention given in the press to the [MISC British  ] angle of the story , it seems to us more likely that this is coincidental . 
Regardless of the state of the two countries political relations , the commercial relationship is very strong and has been largely fenced off by both governments . 
Some of our contacts said it was entirely possible that the connection to the [ORG British Council  ] was simply a [LOC PR  ] " bonus " for the [LOC FSB.  ] ---------------------------- CONCLUSION: FOLLOW THE MONEY ---------------------------- 15 . 
( C ) Fridman/Khan vs. [PER Vekselberg  ] , [ORG TNK  ] vs. [ORG BP  ] , [ORG TNK-BP  ] vs. [ORG Gazprom  ] , [ORG BP  ] vs. [ORG Gazprom  ] , [ORG FSB  ] vs. [MISC Brits  ] , and siloviki vs. siloviki . 
A [ORG BP  ] official told us last week that this situation will probably be " messy for a while " . 
That seems a safe bet . 
Our sense is that this is ultimately a [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00000864 004 OF 004 multi-faceted fight for control and ownership of a multi-billion dollar company , which [ORG BP  ] and its executives at [ORG TNK-BP  ] are caught in the middle of . 
We'll probably never knew who ordered the raid and why or who ordered the [PER Zaslavsky  ] brothers' arrest and why . 
What we will eventually know , to paraphrase [ORG Churchill  ] , is which bulldog emerges from under the carpet with the prize . 
We think it will be [ORG Gazprom  ] , but it may take longer than they would like .
