( [ORG U  ] ) Summary: [LOC Iceland  ] 's economic crisis has radically changed opinions here on the possibility of joining the [ORG European Union  ] , and the country 's political parties are struggling to adapt . 
Polls show support for joining the [ORG EU  ] and adopting the euro reaching 70 percent , while support for the government has fallen below 50 percent . 
Apart from the Foreign Minister 's ( pro-EU ) [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] , all other parties are debating whether and how to add [ORG EU  ] membership to their platforms . 
For the Prime Minister 's [ORG Independence Party  ] , fears of a formal split are running high , while in the opposition [MISC Progressives  ] , the iconic chairman of the party has already resigned over the issue . 
Even the staunchly nationalist [MISC Left-Greens  ] are rethinking their views to retain their base of youth support . 
Decisive party congresses for the [ORG IP  ] and [ORG PP  ] are slated for January 2009 , meaning that even if new ( anti-EU ) parties do not emerge , [LOC Iceland  ] will have a dramatically reshaped political landscape by next spring . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The debate on the merits of joining the [ORG European Union  ] ( [ORG EU  ] ) has become increasingly pronounced after the global credit crunch hit [LOC Iceland  ] , the currency devalued sharply and the government nationalized the country 's three major banks in October . 
Opinion polls in the last month show 60-70 percent of respondents in favor of [ORG EU  ] accession , and similar support for adopting the euro . 
Compared with polls last year , support for membership has increased about 15-25 percentage points . 
In the business community , support for [ORG EU  ] membership is even stronger , with almost all holding to the view that [LOC Iceland  ] 's road to salvation will only run through [LOC Brussels  ] and adoption of the euro ( reftel ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Olli Rehn  ] , the [MISC European  ] Commissioner for Enlargement , has frequently been asked over the past couple of years how long it would take [LOC Iceland  ] to become an [ORG EU  ] member after filing the application . 
His answers have always been positive , and in the past several weeks , the media has placed more emphasis on his comments in light of the financial crisis and speculations regarding [LOC Iceland  ] 's possible [ORG EU  ] membership . 
[PER Rehn  ] has stated that the [ORG European Economic Area  ] ( [ORG EEA  ] ) agreement would serve as a shortcut in accession negotiations for [LOC Iceland  ] . 
He has also said that [LOC Iceland  ] could well compete with [LOC Croatia  ] for becoming the twenty-eighth member of the union , which suggests that [LOC Iceland  ] could become a member no later than 2011 , if [LOC Iceland  ] decided to apply for membership soon . 
In addition , various [ORG EU  ] officials have made it clear that if [LOC Iceland  ] wants to adopt the euro , it has to become a member of the [ORG EU  ] first. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Against this backdrop , [LOC Iceland  ] 's political parties -- both government and opposition -- are scrambling to adapt their policies on [ORG EU  ] membership for [LOC Iceland  ] . 
For some ( [ORG Independence  ] and [MISC Left-Greens  ] ) , this is a fundamental change in orthodoxy , while for others ( [ORG Social Democrats  ] and [ORG Progressives  ] ) a move to [LOC Brussels  ] will simply confirm or codify existing trends . 
The Government -- divided over [ORG EU  ] membership -------------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Prime Minister [PER Haarde  ] 's [ORG Independence Party  ] ( [ORG IP  ] ) has been the largest party in [LOC Iceland  ] and a participant in most governments since the establishment of the republic in 1944 . 
As such , it has virtually dictated [MISC Icelandic  ] foreign policy , been a fervent advocate of [ORG NATO  ] membership and strong transatlantic ties , yet been skeptical about [MISC European  ] integration . 
The [ORG IP  ] still maintains this position , but after the financial crisis hit [LOC Iceland  ] , many party members ( including the [ORG IP Vice Chair  ] and at least one other minister ) have come forth and said that the party should reconsider its position towards joining the [ORG EU  ] and adopting the euro . 
Notably , even Minister of Fisheries and Agriculture [PER Einar K. Gudfinnsson  ] said in an October interview that all possibilities should be considered at this time , although he also reiterated his opposition to [ORG EU  ] membership . 
( [PER Note: Gudfinnsson  ] is one of the strongest historical opponents of joining the [ORG EU  ] , in part due to concerns over the [ORG EU  ] 's [ORG Common Fisheries  ] and Agriculture Policies . 
End note . 
) These calls reflect the [ORG IP  ] 's strong support among the business community , which has already made clear its desire to abandon the [MISC Icelandic  ] krona for another currency ( with the euro the most likely candidate ) . <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On November 14 , the [MISC IP  ] leadership made a historic and significant decision when they announced that they had appointed a committee to discuss [ORG EU  ] membership , and that the results would be presented to the party general meeting , which will be held in January next year ( vice October 2009 as previously scheduled ) . 
Several days before this announcement , the [ORG IP  ] 's General Secretary told [PER PolOff  ] that the party recognized the need to respond to growing public support for [ORG EU  ] membership , but that the result would have to be something " credible " in order for the [ORG IP  ] to regain public support . 
With leadership elections also on the agenda in January , the party meeting could develop into a true showdown over the [ORG IP  ] 's future course . 
Many fear the result will be a split or large-scale defections by the anti-EU group ; [ORG Central Bank Chair  ] ( and former Prime Minister and [ORG IP  ] Chairman ) [PER David Oddsson  ] gave credence to these [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000286 002 OF 003 fears with a November 30 interview in a [MISC Danish  ] newspaper where he said he would re-enter politics should he be fired from the [ORG Central Bank.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The other member of the governing coalition , Foreign Minister [PER Gisladottir  ] 's [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) , is the only political party whose platform openly calls for [ORG EU  ] membership . 
However , prior to the economic crisis , polls showed most [MISC Icelandic  ] voters as skeptical towards [ORG EU  ] membership , leading the [ORG SDA  ] to minimize this plank . 
In the changed conditions here , however , the [ORG SDA  ] is now well prepared for the [ORG EU  ] membership debate ahead given its long-standing pro-EU policy . 
The [ORG SDA  ] firmly believes that [ORG EU  ] membership is vital for [LOC Iceland  ] to reach and maintain economic stability in the long run . 
FM [PER Gisladottir  ] and other [ORG SDA  ] ministers have used the crisis as an opportunity to make these points forcefully , at times even doing so while sharing a press conference podium with PM [PER Haarde  ] . 
The [ORG Opposition: Coalescing  ] around an [ORG EU  ] bid ? -------------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Like the [ORG IP  ] , the [ORG Left-Green Movement  ] ( [ORG LGM  ] ) has always been an anti-EU party . 
The [ORG LGM  ] emphasizes an independent [MISC Icelandic  ] foreign policy that maintains the sovereignty of [LOC Iceland  ] and supports all means of establishing global peace . 
The party rejects participation in the [ORG EU  ] and emphasizes simple , bilateral treaties concerning trade and co-operation . 
However , due to the economic situation and polls showing that a number of [ORG LGM  ] voters also favor [ORG EU  ] membership and adoption of the euro , the [ORG LGM  ] may need to adapt itself to the current situation . 
This is not entirely new -- the party 's Deputy Chair told [PER PolOff  ] in spring 2008 that as the krona grew weaker , many in the party were concluding that [ORG EU  ] membership might be the only realistic choice . 
Despite [ORG LGM Chair  ] [PER Steingrimur Sigfusson  ] 's visceral opposition to [ORG EU  ] membership , signs suggest he may be increasingly isolated . 
At the outset of the crisis in October , the youth wing of the party announced it was formulating a new policy on the [ORG EU  ] instead of simply copying the policy of the mother party . 
Even one of [PER Sigfusson  ] 's longtime ideological allies , Chairman of the [ORG LGM  ] parliamentary group [PER Ogmundur Jonasson  ] , said that the party will soon discuss the possibility of putting [ORG EU  ] accession talks on the agenda and holding a referendum on [ORG EU  ] membership ( despite also reiterating his personal opposition to [ORG EU  ] membership ) . <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) For the [ORG Progressive Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) , the [ORG EU  ] membership debate has sparked the third leadership crisis in just over two years . 
Former Prime Minister and Chair of the [ORG Progressive Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) [PER Halldor Asgrimsson  ] tried to modernize the traditionally agrarian party by appealing to urban voters , and flirting with a more pro-EU policy . 
[PER Asgrimsson  ] 's strategy failed , as confirmed by stinging losses in 2006 's municipal elections and 2007 's parliamentary elections . 
After the 2007 defeat , former Minister of Agriculture [PER Gudni Agustsson  ] took over as party chair , and unsuccessfully attempted to gain support by reverting to a more traditional [ORG PP  ] policy appealing to rural interests . 
As calls here to consider joining the [ORG EU  ] increased , internal tensions came to a head at a biannual meeting of the party 's central committee on November 15 , where the party 's youth wing led harsh criticism of the leadership and called for [ORG EU  ] accession to be clearly placed on the party 's agenda . 
The party moved up its general meeting to January to vote on new leadership and the [ORG EU  ] question . 
Two days later , [ORG PP Chair  ] [PER Agustsson  ] stunned political circles by announcing his resignation as chairman and [ORG MP  ] , saying he was stepping aside to allow the party to reconcile and move ahead . 
[PER Agustsson  ] 's resignation clears the biggest hurdle to a solid pro-EU position for the [ORG PP  ] . 
Most believe that the party is desperately in need of new , younger leadership , though no strong candidates have emerged thus far . 
However , a reinvented , solidly pro-EU [ORG Progressive Party  ] might be a more attractive coalition possibility for the [ORG SDA  ] , should the current government crumble. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The current stance of the [ORG Liberal Party  ] ( [ORG LP  ] ) is a bit murkier compared to the other parties , but given that it is an idiosyncratic party founded on one issue --opposition to the current system of fisheries management --the party is wary of [ORG EU  ] membership as long as its [ORG Common Fisheries Policy  ] remains unchanged . 
The party is currently gauging the views of party members towards the [ORG EU  ] and is expected to update its policy platform accordingly. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: By putting possible [ORG EU  ] membership on their agendas , the parties are now trying to adapt their policies to reflect public will and grab more of what looks like a very volatile electorate . 
While a larger share of voters wants to drop the [MISC Icelandic  ] krona and adopt the euro as soon as possible , control over fishing grounds is still seen as an integral part of the [MISC Icelandic  ] independence struggle and economic sovereignty . 
The [ORG IP  ] and the [ORG PP  ] seem to have realized that sacrificing this sacred cow , as well as agriculture , may be a necessary evil in order to stabilize the [MISC Icelandic  ] economy for the long run . 
If the old guard holds sway among the [MISC Left-Greens  ] , they may turn out to be the only remaining anti-EU party , and might attract a new base of anti-EU voters . 
[ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000286 003 OF 003 However , a more likely scenario might be the emergence of new centrist or center-right parties based on opposition to [ORG EU  ] membership , particularly if the [ORG IP  ] meeting in January turns bitter . 
Regardless , by next spring we will likely see a wholescale realignment of the political spectrum here .
