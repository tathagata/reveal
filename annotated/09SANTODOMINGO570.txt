( C ) Summary: Managers from [LOC U.S.  ] investment company [ORG Advent International  ] told [ORG EconOffs  ] that they have faced numerous barriers to their conduct of business since acquiring the airport concessionaire [ORG Aerodom Dominicana Siglo XXI  ] in October 2008 . 
Among these is a [ORG GODR  ] official who has harassed , threatened and sought bribes from the company . 
Also , President [PER Fernandez  ] issued a decree directly undercutting [ORG Aerodom  ] revenue , in direct violation of the company 's concession . 
As a result of this difficult business environment , the [ORG Aerodom  ] CEO told [LOC EconOff  ] that [ORG Advent  ] plans to turn around the [ORG Aerodom  ] asset within five to seven years and has nixed earlier plans to broaden its investments in the [LOC Dominican Republic  ] . 
End Summary. ---------------------------------- Never again , says [ORG Advent  ] executive ---------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The CEO of airport concessionaire [ORG Aerodom Dominicana Siglo XXI  ] , a subsidiary of the [LOC U.S.  ] investment fund [ORG Advent International  ] , told [ORG EconOffs  ] that he has become disillusioned with the [LOC Dominican Republic  ] as a target for investment . 
Shortly after [ORG Advent  ] purchased [ORG Aerodom  ] in October 2008 , CEO [PER Rodolfo Salgado  ] told the Ambassador that this would be the first of many [ORG Advent  ] investments in the [LOC Dominican Republic  ] . 
Just seven months later , however , [PER Salgado  ] confided to [LOC EconOff  ] that [ORG Advent  ] would make no further investments in the country and sought to turn around [ORG Aerodom  ] within five to seven years . 
He expressed grave misgivings about a government that succeeds in attracting investment through good public relations , pro-business rhetoric and even signing contracts with favorable terms for investors when in reality the panorama for foreign investors is muddled with corrupt intermediaries and a legal framework that is bent to satisfy the whims of public officials. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Salgado  ] echoed a growing refrain that the Embassy is hearing from [LOC U.S.  ] investors in the [LOC Dominican Republic  ] . 
" The [LOC Dominican Republic  ] needs to realize that it is becoming integrated into the global economy and it needs to start behaving as such , " [PER Salgado  ] said . 
He noted that [ORG Advent  ] has been investing in [LOC Latin America  ] for over 20 years and has never faced this level of government resistance to the uninhibited operation of its business . 
[PER Salgado  ] noted two particular issues that the company is facing . 
One is the harassment by [PER Andres Van Der Horst  ] , the director of the [ORG Airport Department  ] , who has sought to disrupt [ORG Aerodom  ] operations in an apparent attempt for personal gains . 
The other is a presidential decree that directly violates [ORG Aerodom  ] 's concessionary contract , the terms of which were ratified by the [PER Fernandez  ] government at [ORG Advent  ] 's request last October. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Aerodom  ] has completed Foreign Commercial Service advocacy forms but has not requested Embassy advocacy as of this time. --------------------------------------------- -- Aviation official pressures [ORG Aerodom  ] for a bribe --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG Aerodom  ] CEO [PER Rodolfo Salgado  ] and [ORG Advent  ] executive [PER Luis Solorzano  ] told [ORG EconOffs  ] that [PER Van Der Horst  ] has harassed , threatened and even explicitly solicited a bribe from the company . 
The [ORG Airport Department  ] , which manages the state-owned airports not included in the [ORG Aerodom  ] concession , has no direct supervisory role over the [MISC Aerodom-operated  ] facilities . 
The only legal relationship between the [ORG Airport Department  ] and [ORG Aerodom  ] is the fact that [PER Van Der Horst  ] sits on the [ORG Airport Commission  ] , the government agency that oversees the concession and is chaired by Secretary of Public Works [PER Victor Diaz Rua  ] . 
[PER Salgado  ] noted that although the [ORG Airport Commission  ] had not met for five years prior to [ORG Advent  ] 's purchase of [ORG Aerodom  ] in October 2008 , it has already met twice since the purchase . 
The content of the meetings has focused on what [PER Salgado  ] described as [PER Van Der Horst  ] 's nitpicky complaints about out-of-order toilets or damage to a non-essential wall surrounding the perimeter fence at [ORG Las Americas International Airport  ] ( [ORG SDQ  ] ) in [PER Santo Domingo.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) These complaints and other similar attcks , contained in what [PER Van Der Horst  ] presented a an official audit of [ORG Las Americas  ] operations autored by the [ORG Airport Department  ] ( even though the [ORG irport Department  ] has no authority or oversight f that airport ) , gained wide coverage in many [MISC Domiican  ] daily newspapers , particularly in late Janury and early February . 
At first , [PER Salgado  ] said , h did not understand why [PER Van Der Horst  ] was attackng his firm . 
Then , [PER Van Der Horst  ] asked [PER Salgado  ] o provide free storage space at the airport for gricultural exporters , a business area where [PER Van Dr Horst  ] has personal and family interests . 
When algado refused this request , [PER Van Der Horst  ] escalated the attacks . 
According to [PER Salgado  ] , General [PER Jaime Osas  ] entered [ORG Aerodom  ] executive offices , placed a firearm on a desk and said he had come " to settle a score between you and my boss . 
" [PER Osas  ] served in the military as an at-large general at the time but made clear that he was representing [PER Van Der Horst  ] during that hostile encounter . 
[ORG Advent  ] executives complained vehemently about the incident and [PER Osas  ] was recently retired by President [PER Fernandez  ] . 
[ORG Aerodom  ] has succeeded in calming the media attacks by hiring a media relations specialist to explain the situation to press representatives and correct the claims made by [PER Van Der Horst.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Salgado  ] also told [ORG EconOffs  ] about an incident that took place at a recent gala dinner for the travel industry . 
Talking over cocktails with a small group of people , including [PER Salgado  ] and [PER Solorzano  ] , [PER Van Der Horst  ] made the comment that " For 5 million pesos ( about USD 143,000 ) , I could go away . 
" While [PER Salgado  ] said [PER Van Der Horst  ] , s tone was joking , he turned abruptly to face [PER Salgado  ] and [PER Solorzano  ] when he made this comment . 
Also present at the time were [PER Arturo Villanueva  ] , the Vice President of the [ORG National Association of Hotels and Restaurants  ] , and [PER Pablo Lister  ] of the [ORG Civil Aviation Board  ] ( [ORG JAC  ] ) . 
[PER Salgado  ] said that although his tone was lighthearted , [PER Van Der Horst  ] 's message was clear and pointed. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) In both of their meetings with [ORG EconOffs  ] , the [ORG Aerodom  ] executives have reiterated their commitment to avoid corrupt practices and assured the Embassy that they would not succumb to [PER Van Der Horst  ] 's solicitations . 
In addition to discussing this issue with EmbOffs on various occasions , including meetings with [ORG EconOffs  ] on February 4 and April 22 , [PER Salgado  ] said he has broached this subject with Foreign Minister [PER Carlos Morales Troncoso  ] , Deputy Foreign Minister [PER Jose Manuel Trullols  ] , [ORG Dominican Civil Aviation Institute  ] Director ( [ORG IDAC  ] ) [PER Jose Tomas Perez  ] , Defense Minister [PER Pedro Pena Antonio  ] , Public Works Minister [PER Diaz  ] , and members of the [ORG JAC  ] . 
The response from these officials was all similar , [PER Salgado  ] said . 
[PER Diaz  ] told him , " It 's just [PER Andres  ] . 
" [PER Morales  ] said , " That man is corrupt . 
" <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [ORG Advent Senior Partner  ] Juan [PER Carlos Torres  ] came to the [LOC Dominican Republic  ] on April 23 to meet with President [PER Fernandez  ] . 
According to [PER Salgado  ] , during the meeting , [PER Torres  ] , [PER Salgado  ] and [ORG Aerodom  ] advisor [PER Jose Luis Abraham  ] explained in " polite " terms that they had trouble dealing with [ORG Van Der Horst  ] . 
After the meeting , [PER Abraham  ] , a close associate of [PER Fernandez  ] , remained with the President and told him more details of the [ORG Van Der Horst  ] problems . 
President [PER Fernandez  ] assured [PER Abraham  ] that he would instruct [ORG Van Der Horst  ] to back off , and noted that August 16 is typically a day when personnel changes are announced . 
[PER Salgado  ] was not sure whether President [PER Fernandez  ] was implying that he would remove [ORG Van Der Horst  ] in August or whether he would simply use this possibility to exert control over [ORG Van Der Horst  ] . 
[PER Salgado  ] said that , so far , President [PER Fernandez' intervention  ] appears to be helping. --------------------------------------------- -------- [PER Fernandez  ] ratified [ORG Aerodom  ] contract , then violated it --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Aerodom  ] also complained of a different , though related , affront on the company 's business . 
In late February , President [PER Fernandez  ] issued a decree eliminating a 4 cent fee charged on air cargo exports of vegetables . 
This was a recommendation from the national economic summit that [PER Fernandez  ] held in February to address the global crisis . 
This fee represents one of the primary revenue generators for [ORG Aerodom  ] and is an integral component of the concession contract . 
[PER Solorzano  ] said that this decree would cost [ORG Aerodom  ] millions of dollars per year , cutting profits by as much as 30 percent . 
[PER Salgado  ] told [ORG EconOffs  ] he has spoken with [ORG Economy  ] , [ORG Planning and Development  ] Minister [PER Temistocles Montas  ] and Customs Director General [PER Miguel Cocco  ] about the decree . 
They both acknowledged that the decree was illegal , but neither was willing to inform the president that he had made a mistake . 
[PER Salgado  ] said he was suspicious that [ORG Van Der Horst  ] may have had a hand in pushing the decree to the President 's desk without a diligent legal review ; the decree is very favorable to agricultural exporters. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Salgado  ] said that this decree was the primary reason for [MISC Torres'  ] visit and the meeting with President [PER Fernandez  ] . 
He said that President [PER Fernandez  ] reacted " frankly and openly " when they told him that the decree violated their contract . 
But [PER Fernandez  ] stopped short of offering to rescind the decree , instead asking [ORG Aerodom  ] for help in strategizing a solution that would allow him to " save face . 
" [PER Salgado  ] said that one possibility would be to impose the fee on airlines that carry cargo and let them pass the costs on to the exporters . 
[PER Fernandez  ] told the [ORG Aerodom  ] executives that [PER Montas  ] would contact them about the solution , but [PER Salgado  ] said he is becoming impatient as three weeks have passed without any visible progress. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Advent  ] experience is unfortunately typical of foreign investors who arrive in the [LOC Dominican Republic  ] enthused by a legal framework that , on paper , appears favorable to business when in reality the investment climate is much less certain . 
When asked in December about his impression of the new [ORG Aerodom  ] management , the general manager of the privately owned and operated [ORG La Romana International Airport  ] told [ORG EconOff  ] that the [MISC American  ] company needs to " aplatanarse " , a term that refers to learning to behave like a [MISC Dominican  ] , in order to survive . 
Yet if [MISC Dominican  ] government officials wish to attract and retain foreign investors , they cannot require these investors to participate in the rampant corruption of " negocios aplatanados " ( [MISC Dominican-style  ] business ) . 
It is the local business climate that needs to reform , not the foreign investors .
