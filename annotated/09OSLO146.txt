[PER Johnson  ] for reasons 1.4 b and d 1 . 
( C ) Summay: Challenged to re-invigorate [MISC Nordic  ] cooperation , former [MISC Norwegian  ] Foreign Minister ( and father of PM [PER Jens Stoltenberg  ] ) [PER Thorvald Stoltenberg  ] presented 13 recommendations proposing greater civil and military cooperation and a [MISC Nordic  ] version of [ORG NATO  ] 's Article Five . 
[PER Stoltenberg  ] delivered his wide-ranging ( and non-binding ) recommendations at the February 9 meeting of the [MISC Nordic  ] Foreign Ministers . 
[LOC Norway  ] 's current FM , [PER Jonas Gahr Stoere  ] , hailed the report as historic and modern . 
Reactions from other [MISC Norwegian  ] policy-makers has been less enthusiastic , but several of the recommendations have potential to increase [MISC Nordic  ] capabilities and cooperation in international operations , a plus for the [ORG UN  ] and [ORG NATO  ] . 
In addition , the [LOC U.S.  ] could propose specific areas where we see [MISC Nordic  ] cooperation contributing to [ORG NATO  ] or [LOC U.S.  ] priorities . 
End Summary . 
A [MISC Nordic Article Five  ] ? --------------------- 2 . 
( C ) The most attention-grabbing of [PER Stoltenberg  ] 's ideas was his call for a [MISC Nordic  ] declaration of solidarity , including a mutually binding security policy guarantee . 
In his introductory press conference , [PER Stoltenberg  ] stressed that this proposal was not designed to take the place of existing treaty commitments , but should be viewed as something additional . 
Nonetheless , this idea was seen by some as a potential challenge to [MISC Swedish  ] and [MISC Finnish  ] neutrality and to [LOC Norway  ] 's traditional transatlantic orientation . 
Reaction in [LOC Norway  ] has been largely dismissive of the idea but it is easy to see echoes of a call by the [MISC Norwegian  ] Socialist [ORG Left Party  ] 's defense spokesman for a division of labor in the [MISC Nordics  ] with [LOC Finland  ] responsible for a joint army , [LOC Sweden  ] for the air force and [LOC Norway  ] for the navy . 
Senior [MISC Norwegian  ] officials including the PM 's foreign policy advisor and the [ORG MFA  ] 's political director have privately indicated to us that there is little or no interest in a [MISC Nordic  ] solidarity declaration in the GON . 
Saving Money and Sharing Responsibilities ----------------------------------------- 3 . 
( U ) Declining defense budgets across the [MISC Nordic  ] region have already inspired the [ORG Chiefs of Defense  ] ( [ORG CHOD  ] ) of [LOC Norway  ] , [LOC Sweden  ] and [LOC Finland  ] to conduct a study on areas of possible cooperation . 
[PER Stoltenberg  ] expands on the [MISC CHODs'  ] study , proposing joint medical units , transport and lift capability ( both air and sea ) , cooperation in training and education ( including firing and exercise ranges ) and joint equipment upgrades and purchases . 
[PER Stoltenberg  ] singled out army material as particularly promising citing the common use of all [MISC Nordics  ] ( with the exception of non-military [LOC Iceland  ] ) of [ORG Leopard  ] 2 battle tanks , [MISC CV-90  ] combat vehicles and [ORG Sisu Pasi  ] armored personnel carriers . 
[PER Stoltenberg  ] also proposed developing a joint amphibious unit , based on current cooperation between [LOC Sweden  ] and [LOC Finland  ] , which could be deployed anywhere in the [MISC Nordics  ] and in international operations . 
4 . 
( C ) Lest [LOC Iceland  ] feel neglected , [PER Stoltenberg  ] proposed that the [MISC Nordics  ] take on part of the responsibility for air surveillance and patrolling over [LOC Iceland  ] . 
Initially this would be through participation in the regular [ORG Northern Viking  ] exercises , followed by rotations in the [ORG NATO  ] air patrol rotations and a possible permanent presence at [LOC Keflavik  ] air base . 
[LOC Norway  ] and [LOC Denmark  ] already participate in the [ORG NATO  ] program . 
[MISC Swedish  ] and [MISC Finnish  ] participation would require finalization of an agreement between [ORG NATO  ] and [LOC Sweden  ] and [LOC Finland  ] on data exchange with [ORG NATO  ] 's air defense system . 
In theory this sort of cooperation could be a practical example of cooperation under the [MISC Partnership for Peace  ] program . 
Surprisingly , [MISC Norwegian  ] officials have been very critical of this proposal , with the [ORG MFA  ] 's Political Director and the PM 's International Advisor both expressing strong dislike for this item . 
[ORG OSLO  ] 00000146 002 OF 003 Keeping an eye on [ORG Polar Bears  ] and [MISC Russians  ] ------------------------------------------ 5 . 
( U ) Maritime monitoring is a central focus of the report with three separate but interrelated recommendations . 
These include establishing a [MISC Nordic  ] maritime monitoring system , a joint maritime response force , and a joint satellite system for surveillance and communications . 
The monitoring system and the satellite proposal all reflect the need for improvements in the ability to monitor civilian and military shipping , environmental data and pollution . 
This need will increase if shipping volume in the region increases due to sea ice melting or development of energy projects such as the [LOC Shtockman  ] field . 
[LOC Norway  ] is in the process of developing a civilian-military [LOC Barents Sea  ] monitoring system called [ORG Barents Watch  ] , and [LOC Sweden  ] and [LOC Finland  ] are currently expanding their joint defense surveillance system to the entire [LOC Baltic Sea  ] . 
[PER Stoltenberg  ] calls for a joint [MISC Nordic  ] effort to ensure that national efforts are combatable and do not replicate functions . 
A joint satellite would allow for complete and constant monitoring of the entire [MISC Nordic  ] region , as well as enabling secure communications in the event of a crisis . 
Currently the [MISC Nordic  ] nations purchase satellite services from [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC European  ] suppliers which do not provide satisfactory coverage above 71 degrees north . 
Once a monitoring system is in place there will be a need for a response capability for search and rescue and other emergencies . 
This capability should include icebreakers fit for [MISC Arctic  ] use . 
Although [MISC Baltic  ] capabilities are strong , there are not currently enough resources to cover the vast sea areas under [MISC Norwegian  ] , [MISC Danish  ] ( [LOC Greenland  ] ) and [MISC Icelandic  ] control , particularly if shipping in the area increases . 
Addressing 21st Century Challenges ---------------------------------- 6 . 
( U ) [PER Stoltenberg  ] also proposed a number of ideas which would increase civil cooperation including a [MISC Nordic  ] stabilization task force , a joint disaster response unit , a [MISC Nordic  ] resource network to protect against cyber attacks , a war crimes investigation unit , cooperation between foreign services , and on [MISC Arctic  ] issues . 
The need for cooperation in war crimes prosecution , protection of infrastructure from cyber attack and on [MISC Arctic  ] issues is clear and relatively non-controversial . 
Cooperation between foreign services is much more difficult and will likely be limited to countries where none of the [MISC Nordics  ] have representation now . 
7 . 
( U ) As envisioned , the [MISC Nordic  ] stabilization task force would consist of military , humanitarian , state-building ( police officers , judges , prison officers , election observers ) and development assistance components . 
This unit would be intended for use in [MISC UN-led  ] operations and for [ORG NATO  ] , [ORG EU  ] , [ORG AU  ] or [ORG OSCE  ] missions with a [ORG UN  ] mandate . 
[PER Stoltenberg  ] proposes that the military forces allocated to this unit be drawn from those currently available for the [ORG EU  ] [MISC Nordic  ] [ORG Battle Group  ] and the [ORG NATO  ] Response Force . 
Dreams or Reality ? ----------------- 8 . 
( C ) Comment: High defense costs , a genuine preference to work with other [MISC Nordics  ] and clear regional needs are real factors which inspired the [PER Stoltenberg  ] study and which may result in some of his recommendations being followed . 
The [MISC Nordic  ] Ministers will meet next on June 9 in [LOC Iceland  ] and will announce which recommendations will be pursued . 
GON officials have uniformly stressed that where money can be saved and capabilities increased they are positive . 
They were much less positive about the grander ambitions , such as the [MISC Nordic  ] solidarity declaration and taking over responsibility for [LOC Iceland  ] 's air patrols . 
Where this study could result in something of value is primarily in any increase in military , international operations and surveillance capacity . 
Joint [MISC Nordic  ] transport capabilities , medical teams , amphibious units , a stabilization task force and maritime awareness could be important contributions to [ORG UN  ] , [ORG NATO  ] or [LOC U.S.  ] missions. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>Â¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The [LOC U.S.  ] should encourage [MISC Nordic  ] cooperation to the [ORG OSLO  ] 00000146 003 OF 003 extent that it increases the [MISC Nordics'  ] willingness and ability to improve their internal and international capabilities to deal with global challenges . 
It may also be of benefit to propose specific issues where we see [MISC Nordic  ] cooperation contributing to [ORG NATO  ] or [LOC U.S.  ] priorities , such as maritime monitoring of the [ORG Barents  ] , the development of stabilization teams , increases in military capacity , prosecution of war criminals , etc .
