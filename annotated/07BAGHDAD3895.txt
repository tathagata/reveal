( C ) [LOC UK  ] Ambassador to [LOC Tehran  ] [PER Geoffrey Adams  ] , in a series of meetings with [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy [LOC Baghdad  ] and [MISC MNF-I  ] officials , outlined his recommendations on how to negotiate with [MISC Iranians  ] . 
Ambassador [PER Adams  ] thought that [LOC Iran  ] had several goals from talks with the [LOC U.S.  ] , both superficial and substantive . 
In negotiations , he advised being steady and firm , tough but not aggressive , and at the same time , seeking to engage and draw attention to mutual interests . 
He outlined [LOC Iran  ] , s preconceptions and its obsession with and mistrust of the [LOC West  ] , which , he said , can blind it to its interests . 
He warned that the [MISC Iranian  ] participants would likely have very strict instructions what they could say and that it would be difficult to get them off script , though the element of surprise could work . 
[PER Adams  ] added that the [MISC Iranians  ] would be very nervous of negative repercussions if they made a misstep , and they would likely report on each other . 
Answers to questions and proposals would more likely only come at follow-on meetings , and decision-making in [LOC Iran  ] is slowed by the need for consensus , so patience is needed . 
That said , it was important to rid the [MISC Iranians  ] of their standard notion that time was on their side . 
End summary 2 . 
( C ) [MISC British  ] Ambassador to [LOC Iran  ] [PER Geoffrey Adams  ] offered advice in negotiating strategies with [LOC Iran  ] in a series of meetings with [LOC U.S.  ] officials and military officers in [LOC Baghdad  ] November 24-25 . 
The following is an amalgamation of three meetings , held in advance of the fourth round of [LOC Iran-Iraq-U.S.  ] trilateral discussions on [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[PER Adams  ] , who has served in [LOC Tehran  ] for almost two years , said his observations were borne of much experience , to include a &master class8 when [LOC Iran  ] captured at gunpoint 15 [ORG British Navy  ] personnel in March 2007 . 
[MISC British  ] Ambassador to [LOC Kuwait  ] [PER Stuart Laing  ] also joined the discussions , as well as [MISC British  ] First Secretary in [LOC Tehran  ] [PER Alex Pinfield  ] . 
Among those present on the [LOC U.S.  ] side at various briefings were Ambassador [PER Crocker  ] , [ORG MNF-I Commanding General Petraeus  ] , Pol-Mil Minister Counselor Ambassador [PER Marcie Ries  ] , [ORG MG  ] [PER Kevin Bergner  ] , [ORG Special Advisor David Pearce  ] , and IRPO Director [PER Jillian Burns  ] . 
The [MISC British  ] ambassador , s views of [LOC Iran  ] , s strategic interests and the internal political situation to be reported septel . 
3 . 
( C ) [MISC Iranians  ] , goal , in [PER Adams  ] , view , is to institutionalize talks with the [LOC U.S.  ] and keep open the possibility of broadening the agenda . 
While he heard that the [MISC Iranians  ] were disappointed in the &lack of substance8 in previous bilateral talks with the [LOC U.S  ] , they felt they derived good publicity from participating . 
[PER Adams  ] predicted the [MISC Iranians  ] will seek to keep them going both to engender their prestige and to keep tabs on what the [ORG USG  ] is thinking . 
He also thought the talks had triggered a useful internal debate in how to make the best use of the talks and their strategic interests . 
[PER Adams  ] added that he believed there is a significant lobby in [LOC Iran  ] against holding talks with the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Assumptions  ] --------------- 4 . 
( C ) In talks with [MISC Iranians  ] , Ambassador [PER Adams  ] recommended being steady and firm , tough but not aggressive , and at the same time , seeking to engage . 
He stressed that [MISC Iranians  ] are obsessed with the [LOC West  ] and this obsession at times blinds them to their interests . 
In this light , the [LOC US  ] side should be aware of the following preconceptions on the [MISC Iranian  ] side: -- the [ORG USG  ] seeks to remove the current regime and replace it with a pro-Western one . 
-- [ORG USG  ] policymakers spend an inordinate amount of time and energy thinking about ( and plotting against ) [LOC Iran  ] . 
As such , [MISC Iranians  ] assume that everything we do or say has meaning and has been carefully thought out and coordinated , both internally and with the [LOC UK  ] ; there are no accidents . 
-- The current [LOC U.S.  ] administration is politically very weak , facing major internal opposition , and as such , the threat of [LOC US  ] military action against [LOC Iran  ] is not realistic . 
-- [LOC Iran  ] sees the [LOC U.S.  ] as a tough , determined adversary that can be manipulated and wounded . 
Mistrust ---------- [LOC BAGHDAD  ] 00003895 002.4 OF 003 5 . 
( C ) The legacy of the [MISC Iran-Iraq  ] war , when the international community was either silent or sided with [PER Saddam  ] ( even when he used WMD against [MISC Iranians  ] ) must be kept in mind . 
[MISC Iranians  ] mistrust the outside world , to include the very same [MISC Western  ] powers and [PER Sunni Arab  ] states that are now seeking to ensure that pro-Iranian Shias do not dominate power in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Short Leash -------------- 6 . 
( C ) [LOC Islamic Republic of Iran  ] ( [ORG IRI  ] ) government negotiators arrive with precise and detailed instructions from which they do not deviate , out of fear of professional repercussions . 
They will go through all their talking points . 
The [ORG USG  ] should not expect substantive responses to questions or initiatives in real time . 
This problem can be obviated to an extent by scheduling &lots of breaks , 8 allowing [LOC IRIG  ] officials time to confer amongst themselves and to seek guidance via telephone from [LOC Tehran  ] . 
However , given the fear of a misstep on the [ORG IRI  ] side , the [ORG USG  ] should not expect real engagement from the [ORG IRI  ] outside of their instructions . 
Answers to questions and responses to suggestions are likely to come at follow-on meetings , although some questions never get answered . 
Preparation -------------- 7 . 
( C ) [LOC IRIG  ] officials will likely prepare in detail for the talks . 
They may consult with [MISC Iranians  ] with extensive experience with [MISC Americans  ] , such as academics who have participated in [MISC Track Two  ] talks or worked in the [LOC U.S.  ] He also mentioned that the head of [LOC Iran  ] , s [ORG Chamber of Commerce  ] [PER Mohammad Nahavandian  ] is also perceived as a [LOC U.S.  ] expert and is likely consulted . 
[PER Adams  ] doubted that [LOC Iran  ] would seek advice in negotiating with [MISC Americans  ] from other countries . 
[PER Adams  ] repeatedly said , &Iranians are not stupid , 8 meaning they follow all the issues closely , even if they at times misread the signals . 
Slow Process ---------------- 8 . 
( C ) In light of the short leash negotiators have , plus the collaborative and multi-polar nature of [ORG IRI  ] decision-making and the extreme sensitivity of the topic of direct [MISC USG-IRIG  ] talks , the [ORG USG  ] should not expect immediate &big steps.8 Any progress will be slow and come only after much deliberation and discussion in [LOC Iran  ] , with push-back from those circles opposing talks . 
If the [LOC IRIG  ] concludes that a policy shift is in their interests , it can do it and find a way to justify it , but will first have to achieve internal consensus . 
Stay Calm ------------ 9 . 
( C ) It is important with the [MISC Iranians  ] not to lose one , s temper or show that one is upset . 
Trading accusations allows the [LOC IRIG  ] to rely on a familiar script ; far better is to ask unexpected questions that will take them &off-script.8 When asked how to best broach continued [LOC IRIG  ] support of [ORG JAM  ] splinter groups despite [LOC IRIG  ] assurances to the Government of [LOC Iraq  ] to stop the flow of weapons , [PER Adams  ] recommended keeping the tone matter-of-fact and raising issues in question form , i.e. &given your assurances that you are seeking to help [MISC Iraqi  ] forces re-establish peace and security , how can we explain the ongoing training of [MISC JAM-related  ] illegal combatants in [LOC Iran  ] ? 8 [ORG Agenda ---------  ] 10 . 
( C ) [PER Don  ] , t offer an agenda beforehand , otherwise the agenda itself will become subject to ongoing negotiations . 
[ORG Establish Mutual Interests  ] ------------------------------- 11 . 
( C ) Seek to show a commonality or intersection of national interests that will justify [LOC Iran  ] taking actions suggested by the [ORG USG  ] . 
Prove to them that &if we fail in [LOC Iraq  ] , they fail too.8 Draw them out on their contradictory tactics in order to spark debate within the [LOC IRIG  ] . 
Assess what the [MISC Iranians  ] want out of the talks , beyond their publicly stated position of wanting a timetable for a withdrawal of foreign troops . 
[LOC BAGHDAD  ] 00003895 003 OF 003 Clock Ticking ----------------- 12 . 
( C ) [LOC IRIG  ] interlocutors assume that time is on their side and hence default towards inaction . 
Convince them that now is the time to act , and that not doing so will hurt their interests and that the situation could get worse . 
In a related vein , the [ORG IRI  ] must be convinced that the [ORG USG  ] is prepared to stop dialogue ( although not necessarily close the channel ) if there is no progress . 
At the same time , realize internally that the negotiators cannot take a bold move without consultation , a reasonable degree of patience is required , and progress may take time . 
Put the Ball in Their Court -------------------------------- 13 . 
( C ) Ask a lot of questions , always put the ball back in their court . 
Doing so will encourage internal discussion and debate in [LOC Tehran  ] , as well as put pressure on them to deviate from their prepared script . 
Wrong foot them by saying something unexpected to try to take them off script . 
Focus on accountability , asking for clarifications of actions that contradict their stated commitments . 
Keep your message clear , including redlines , and do not be too subtle . 
Weaknesses -------------- 14 . 
( C ) Despite their rhetoric , [MISC Iranians  ] understand their weaknesses include a lack of allies and foreign investment . 
Publicity ---------- 15 . 
( C ) [LOC Iran  ] is very sensitive to press coverage that makes them look weak . 
At the same time , the [LOC IRIG  ] has a &high threshold for embarrassment8 when they are accused of illicit activities . 
After the talks , the [LOC IRIG  ] will seek to present the exchange as &businesslike , 8 with the [LOC US  ] and [LOC Iran  ] on equal footing , where the [LOC IRIG  ] &gave nothing away.8 BUTENIS</pre></code>
