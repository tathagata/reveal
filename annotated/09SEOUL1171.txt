Reasons 1.4 ( b/d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: In a July 20 meeting , Unification Minister [PER Hyun In-taek  ] outlined [PER Kim Jong-il’s  ] health and succession concerns , key figures and the current state of the [ORG DPRK for A/S Campbell  ] . 
Although [PER Kim Jong-il  ] ( [ORG KJI  ] ) remained firmly in control of the regime for now , he was unlikely to live beyond 2015 . 
On succession , [PER Hyun  ] observed the current succession preparations for [PER Kim Jung-un  ] were “rushed , ” and anticipated additional “fireworks” ( either a third nuclear test or missile launches ) at the end of the current 150-day campaign , scheduled to end in mid-October . 
[LOC North Korea  ] would return to dialogue afterwards . 
[LOC North Korea  ] is suffering from severe food shortage and devastating economic crisis caused by lack of foreign aid , economic foundation and decent harvest . 
The situation is worse than the 1996/ 1997 crisis , because the economic uncertainty is taking place during , not after , a power transition period . 
Desperate for cash , [PER Hyun  ] believed [LOC North Korea  ] would sell nuclear technology to potential buyers . 
[LOC North Korea  ] desired to be a “strong state , ” ideologically , militarily and economically . 
Nuclear power would allow two of the three: ideological and military strength . 
The role of the [ORG DPRK Foreign Ministry  ] diminished after [PER Kim Gae-kwan  ] failed to “deal with the [ORG United States.”  ] The [ORG Kaesong Industrial Complex  ] ( [ORG KIC  ] ) remained a source for cash for the [ORG DPRK  ] ; it was also a potential window of opportunity for inter-Korean cooperation , and at the same time a potential political liability for both [MISC Koreas  ] . 
[PER Hyun  ] believed [LOC North Korea  ] after [MISC KJI’s  ] death would look very different than the current state and require economic assistance from [LOC South Korea  ] and the [LOC United States  ] . 
[PER Hyun  ] also underscored the importance the [MISC U.S.-ROK  ] cooperation and believed a unified [LOC Korea  ] should be nuclear free . 
END SUMMARY. -------------------------- [MISC KJI’s  ] Heath and Succession -------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) While [MISC KJI’s  ] overall political power remained “firm and strong , ” his health was weakening , [PER Hyun  ] said . 
[MISC South Korean  ] analysts believed that [ORG KJI  ] was unlikely to live more than 3 to 5 years , although he seemed to be doing better lately . 
[ORG MOU  ] had not discovered any firm basis for rumored pancreatic cancer , reports of which stemmed from a [MISC Japanese  ] press article with a [LOC Beijing  ] source . 
[PER Wang Jiarui  ] , Director for [ORG PRC Communist Party International Liaison Department  ] , told [PER Hyun  ] that when he had met with [ORG KJI  ] in January , [PER Wang  ] could not detect any scars on [MISC KJI’s  ] head from his widely reported surgery after suffering a stroke . 
Also , [ORG KJI  ] did not look as though he would die soon when he attended the 15-year commemoration of the death of his father , [PER Kim Il-sung  ] , on July 8 . 
[ORG KJI  ] remained for the entire duration of the celebration -- over three hours -- and met with his staff for about 20 minutes after the event. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Hyun  ] observed that the current , “rushed , ” pace of succession preparation in the [LOC North  ] was noteworthy. “Semi-officially , ” [PER Hyun  ] said , the transition had started , with some power and authority already transferred to the youngest son , [PER Kim Jong-un  ] , who had already been recognized publicly as a “young commander” and a “brilliant star.” The current 150-day campaign , scheduled to end in mid-October , was to provide a boost to a smoother transition . 
[PER Hyun  ] said he expected further nuclear and/or missile tests in October ; perhaps , after that , [LOC North Korea  ] would return to the nuclear talks. -------------------------------- Return to Dialogue After October -------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Hyun  ] said it was only a matter of time before [LOC North Korea  ] returned to the nuclear talks ; the only question was when . 
[LOC North Korea  ] faced a severely degraded economy , serious food shortages , and a shortage of foreign currency . 
It could resist for a while , but not for a long time . 
The Five Parties , therefore , should focus on how to manage the return of [LOC North Korea  ] to the negotiations . 
If the return was not well managed , there would be poor results . 
The [LOC United States  ] and [LOC South Korea  ] must apply patience and pressure. -------------------------------- The Current State of [LOC North Korea  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) According to [PER Hyun  ] , [LOC North Korea  ] now faced a very difficult economic situation , similar to the conditions in 1996 and 1997 . 
[PER Hyun  ] pointed out that [LOC North Korea  ] “produces nothing” and had “no meaningful trade” with the outside world . 
On food , [PER Hyun  ] said that [LOC North Korea  ] was now asking private [ORG ROK  ] entities for food assistance . 
[PER Hyun  ] confirmed that the [LOC ROKG  ] did not send food aid or fertilizer to the [ORG DPRK  ] from 2008 to present . 
Having also refused [LOC U.S.  ] food aid , the [ORG DPRK  ] was severely suffering , and the food situation would not improve soon , [PER Hyun  ] said . 
Since early July , [LOC North Korea  ] had suffered from unusually heavy rainfall , which would have a devastating effect on the harvest this year. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) On inter-Korean trade , [PER Hyun  ] cited data from the [ORG Korea Development Institute  ] ( [ORG KDI  ] ) , which showed a sharp decrease in inter-Korean trade over the past six months . 
Moreover , inter-Korean projects such as [PER Mt. Kumkang  ] and [LOC Kaesong  ] city tours , major sources of cash , had dried up completely because they were closed in July and December 2008 . 
The remaining , legitimate , cash flow for the [ORG North is  ] now the [ORG Kaesong Industrial Complex  ] ( [ORG KIC  ] ) , from which the [ORG North receives  ] about USD 35 million for its 40,000 workers . 
[PER Hyun  ] believed that [LOC North Korea  ] could , and would , sell nuclear technology , and even plutonium. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Hyun  ] assessed that Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile tests were to earn “one big deal” with the [LOC United States  ] . 
[LOC North Korea  ] wanted to be recognized as a nuclear state . 
[ORG North Korea’s  ] goals were to become ideologically , militarily , and economically a strong state . 
Aiming to achieve “strength” in all areas by 2012 , the year when [LOC North Korea  ] will “enter the gateway to become a strong and prosperous nation , ” according [MISC North Korean  ] schedule . 
[PER Hyun  ] said the ideological goal was already achieved through [PER Kim Il-sung’s Juche  ] , or self-reliance , ideology . 
The [MISC DPRK’s  ] aim to become a military power was “nearly achieved , ” through the [ORG North’s  ] nuclear and missile capabilities . 
In [LOC North  ] Korea’s view , ideological and military strength would come from becoming a nuclear power . 
When [LOC North Korea  ] would “gain strength” on all three fronts , it would also obtain the recognition and respect from the rest of the world. ----------- Key players ----------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Hyun  ] identified [PER Jang Sung-taek  ] as the central figure in [LOC North Korea  ] at the moment , probably the second-in-command . 
However , [PER Jang  ] did not oversee serious military issues , including nuclear and missile programs . 
On military issues , key authority was held by the [ORG National Defense Committee  ] . 
Among the committee members , [PER Hyun  ] said Joo koo-chan was responsible for the rocket launch , and Oh [MISC Kuk-ryul  ] and [PER Kim Young-choon  ] were key decision makers within the military . 
Other [ORG National Defense Committee  ] members , such as [PER Cho Myung-rok  ] , who had met President [PER Clinton  ] , were not doing well because of old age . 
Oh [MISC Kuk-ryul  ] and [PER Kim Young-choon  ] were also old , but remained active . 
According to Hyun’s sources , [PER Kim Young-choon  ] suffers from bad hearing , but remained one of [MISC KJI’s  ] close confidants . 
Apparently , [ORG KJI  ] called for [PER Kim Young-choon  ] twice on July 8 , at the celebration of the 15th anniversary of [MISC KIS’s  ] death -- a clear sign of influence . 
[PER Hyun  ] also identified [PER Kim Jeong-gak  ] as “very powerful , ” but underscored that [ORG KJI  ] still controls “everything , including the military.” ----------------------------------- Diminishing Foreign Ministry’s Role ----------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) In the past , the [ORG DPRK  ] Foreign Ministry enjoyed some of influence and power , as a check-and-balance element of the [ORG DPRK  ] regime . 
Currently , that balance system has broken down and the foreign ministry’s role has diminished considerably . 
One reason for this downfall , according to [PER Hyun  ] , was the perceived failure of the [MISC Six-Party Talks  ] ( 6PT ) where [PER Kim Gye-kwan  ] did “not deal with the [LOC United States  ] successfully.” [PER Hyun  ] said that the [MISC North Korean  ] authorities expected a lot from [PER Kim Gye-kwan  ] , but he had “failed to deliver.” ------------------------------- [ORG Kaesong Industrial Complex  ] ( [ORG KIC  ] ) ------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Hyun  ] saw the [ORG KIC  ] as a window of opportunity for inter-Korean development , especially in introducing [MISC South Korean  ] capitalism to the [LOC North  ] . 
Run by [MISC South Korean  ] managers and machines , the [ORG KIC  ] provides glimpse of the [MISC South Korean  ] way of life to over 40,000 [MISC North Korean  ] workers and their external families . 
The workers’ change in appearance and way of thinking was visible , [PER Hyun  ] said . 
The 40,000 [ORG KIC  ] workers could spread the [ORG South Korea’s  ] way of life to their families , thus directly affecting some 150,000 people around [LOC Kaesong  ] city . 
[PER Hyun  ] also noted that , the [ORG KIC  ] was a divisive issue in [LOC South Korea  ] too . 
The [LOC North  ] could use [ORG KIC  ] to “divide” the [LOC South  ] , [PER Hyun  ] assessed , but still , [PER Hyun  ] said , most of [LOC South Korea  ] , including the [LOC ROKG  ] , did not want the project to fail. ----------- Way forward ----------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Hyun  ] believed [LOC North Korea  ] after [MISC KJI’s  ] death would look very different , requiring considerable economic assistance from [LOC South Korea  ] , the [LOC United States  ] and international community . 
[PER Hyun  ] advised that in case of a sudden collapse in [LOC North Korea  ] , the [LOC ROKG  ] and [ORG USG  ] should move quickly toward unification of the [MISC Korean  ] peninsula . 
There was “no disagreement” among [ORG ROK  ] agencies on this point , [PER Hyun  ] said . 
The [ORG USG  ] could expect “full cooperation” from the [LOC ROKG  ] ; unification was the goal of [LOC South Korea  ] . 
[PER Hyun  ] underscored the importance the [MISC U.S.-ROK  ] cooperation and stated that a unified [LOC Korea  ] should be nuclear free. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 .
