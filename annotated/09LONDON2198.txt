End Summary Welcoming [ORG U.S. Leadership  ] ------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) While in [LOC London  ] for the September 3-4 [ORG P5 Conference  ] on [ORG Confidence Building Measures Towards Nuclear Disarmament  ] , U/S [PER Tauscher  ] held separate meetings September 2-4 with Foreign Secretary [PER David Miliband  ] , [PER Simon McDonald  ] , Head of the Foreign and [ORG Defence Policy Secretariat  ] at the [ORG Cabinet Office  ] , [PER Mariot Leslie  ] , Director General , [ORG Defence and Intelligence  ] , Foreign and [ORG Commonwealth Office  ] ( [ORG FCO  ] ) , and [PER Jon Day  ] , MOD Director General for [ORG Security Policy  ] . 
The [MISC British  ] interlocutors underscored that the [LOC UK  ] welcomes [LOC U.S.  ] leadership on nonproliferation , disarmament and arms control . 
FS [PER Miliband  ] expressed appreciation for President [PER Obama’s Prague  ] speech , observing that the process for getting to “a world at or close to zero in terms of nuclear arms is not a straight line” but is long and complex . 
[PER McDonald  ] said that for the last forty years the nuclear states have downplayed the obligation to spread civil nuclear power and to disarm ; President [PER Obama’s  ] leadership presents an opportunity to change that dynamic . 
DG [PER Leslie  ] observed that [LOC UK  ] decision makers are “fired up by how the President has made the ( nonproliferation ) agenda his own.” Prime Minister Brown wants to “refresh and refurbish” the [ORG Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty  ] ( [ORG NPT  ] ) , she said . 
DG Day said he was “delighted” that the [LOC U.S.  ] has “resumed leadership” on nonproliferation , arms control and disarmament . 
Maintaining [ORG P3  ] and [ORG P5 Unity  ] --------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Leslie  ] stressed that the [LOC UK  ] position is “really very similar to your Administration on nearly everything.” The UK’s goal is for the [ORG P5  ] to work well together but we should “not scare the horses , ” which means “not scaring off the [MISC French”  ] and “keeping the [MISC Chinese  ] and [MISC Russians  ] on board.” She acknowledged that it was “hard to get everyone together” for the 9/3-4 [ORG P5 Conference  ] , but expressed hope that it would help cement [ORG P5  ] unity in the lead-up to the [ORG NPT Review Confererence  ] ( RevCon ) . 
Day acknowledged that the 9/3-4 [ORG P5 Conference  ] was not a vehicle designed to make progress by “leaps and bounds.” He stressed that “the engagement is valuable” and would help cement [ORG P5  ] unity. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) We need a strong , but unanimous , signal from the [ORG UN Security Council  ] ( [ORG UNSC  ] ) at the [ORG UNSC Heads of Government Summit  ] , [PER Simon McDonald  ] stressed , noting that the first draft resolution was a disappointment . 
The [LOC UK  ] interlocutors agreed on the importance of [ORG P5  ] unity at the summit , as well as on the importance of close [ORG P3  ] and [ORG P5  ] coordination in the lead-up to the summit and to the [ORG NPT  ] RevCon . 
[PER McDonald  ] also observed that [LOC Libya  ] was on the [ORG UNSC  ] and that the [ORG P5  ] should take positive note of the fact that [LOC Libya  ] has made a “strategic shift” on nuclear proliferation . 
[LOC France  ] and [ORG P3 Unity  ] ------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) DG [PER Leslie  ] said that the [LOC UK  ] had done a “lot of hard [LOC LONDON  ] 00002198 002 OF 005 work and expressed a commitment to disarmament...and the [MISC French  ] are uncomfortable with this.” [PER Leslie  ] said that the [LOC UK  ] “gets on well” with the [MISC French  ] , but the [MISC French  ] are “excessively worried about what they view as unilateral [LOC UK  ] disarmament.” She said that [ORG P3  ] talks would help maintain [ORG P3  ] unity ; “We need to reassure [LOC France  ] , ” she said . 
[PER Leslie  ] characterized closer [ORG U.S.-France  ] relations as “extremely healthy.” <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) U/S [PER Tauscher  ] , [PER Leslie  ] , and Day agreed to regular [ORG P3  ] meetings , starting in October , to help cement [ORG P3  ] unity . 
[MISC French  ] interlocutors also agreed , during separate bilateral meetings with [PER Tauscher  ] , on the importance of regular [ORG P3  ] consultations . 
[ORG Missile Defense  ] and the [ORG Nuclear Posture Review  ] --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) U/S [PER Tauscher  ] described the [ORG Missile Defense  ] review underway in [LOC Washington  ] , with emphasis on countering the [MISC Iranian  ] missile threat to [LOC Europe  ] with proven technology . 
She also described the [ORG Nuclear Posture Review  ] ( [ORG NPR  ] ) , which would replace the 2002 [ORG NPR  ] and would address questions such as extended deterrence and security assurances . 
Her [LOC UK  ] interlocutors expressed considerable interest in both reviews , and she made clear the [LOC U.S.  ] would consult bilaterally and with [ORG NATO  ] as soon as the reviews progress to that point . 
Political consensus on a [ORG Strategic Defense Review  ] --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Day acknowledged that “the next year will be pretty disruptive” in the [LOC UK  ] as the two major parties prepare for the next general election . 
He stressed that both the [ORG Labour  ] and [ORG Conservative  ] parties are committed to a [ORG Strategic Defense Review  ] after the election . 
He predicted that neither political conflict between the two major parties nor the defense review would affect arms control policy , although he advised that these factors “may distract the attention” of political leaders . 
He predicted that “defense will be a bigger issue than it usually is” during the [MISC British  ] electoral period . 
He cited intense debate over [MISC Britain’s  ] role in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and the “defense budget crisis” as two prominent issues. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Day opined that “mobilizing” [ORG NATO  ] allies after General [PER McChrystal  ] released the results of his review would be “very difficult.” “Our message” to the [LOC U.S.  ] is “bear with us... we will continue to work closely with you , ” [PER Day  ] said . 
He pledged to work closely with the [LOC U.S.  ] on the [ORG Quadrennial Defense Review  ] ( [ORG QDR  ] ) and [ORG National Posture Review  ] ( [ORG NPR  ] ) as well as on the UK’s [ORG Strategic Defense Review  ] . 
In regard to the [LOC UK  ] review , Day observed that he had worked on the last review in 1997-98 , and he bemoaned the lack of institutional memory within HMG regarding the review process. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Day also promised that the [LOC UK  ] had “put measures in place to protect your interests” during the [LOC UK  ] inquiry into the causes of the [LOC Iraq  ] war . 
He noted that [LOC Iraq  ] seems no longer to be a major issue in the [LOC U.S.  ] , but he said it would become a big issue -- a “feeding frenzy” -- in the [LOC UK  ] “when the inquiry takes off.” [LOC Iran  ] ---- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Tauscher  ] made clear that [LOC Iran  ] needed to respond to the [ORG P5  ] 1 offer prior to the [LOC UNGA  ] , at which point there would be a stock-taking ; absent progress , attention would turn to substantially stronger sanctions . 
[PER FS Milband  ] opined that [LOC U.S.  ] Administration is “rightly trying to overcome a deficit of prejudice and mistrust in a relatively short time” by diplomatic outreach to [LOC Iran  ] . 
He continued that the [MISC Iranian  ] elections were a “bad outcome” -- an outcome that had given extremists the upper hand and resulted in a “culling of reformists.” [PER Miliband  ] said that , in his opinion , Iran’s extremist government would not make concessions in a short time . 
Nonetheless , the [LOC U.S.  ] “Administration’s support for a diplomatic solution is very wise.” He praised the impact of financial sanctions spearheaded by [ORG Treasury  ] U/S [PER Levey  ] . 
[PER Leslie  ] asserted that the [MISC Iranian  ] administration is “in a state of flux” and “not focused , ” so probably unable to respond to overtures . 
[LOC LONDON  ] 00002198 003 OF 005 <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER McDonald  ] stressed that the PM supports the [MISC President’s  ] outreach efforts to [LOC Iran  ] , but this outreach should not be “open ended.” The [LOC UK  ] view is that “if [LOC Iran  ] is not responsive , we have to get serious.” [LOC UK  ] experts have concluded that stronger sanctions should be in place by the end of the year if [LOC Iran  ] is not significantly responsive by the end of September . 
[PER McDonald  ] observed that it would take some time to negotiate a [ORG UNSCR  ] ; in the meantime , the [LOC UK  ] is considering national steps it could take as well as possible steps the [ORG EU  ] could take . 
HMG shares NSA Jones’ view that proliferation problems posed by [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC North Korea  ] should be addressed together , not as separate , unrelated issues , [PER McDonald  ] said . 
[MISC Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty  ] ( [MISC CTBT  ] ) ------------------------------------ <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [LOC UK  ] interlocutors sought an update from [PER U/S Tauscher  ] on the progress toward [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Senate  ] ratification of the [MISC Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty  ] ( [MISC CTBT  ] ) -- and on the [MISC President’s  ] leadership on [MISC CTBT  ] ratification . 
[PER Tauscher  ] said the ratification of the [MISC CTBT  ] had high priority . 
START had a certain urgency , given the December 5 expiration ; we were working in parallel to prepare for ratification of [MISC CTBT  ] , including a new [ORG National Academy  ] study , a new [ORG National Intelligence Estimate  ] ( [ORG NIE  ] ) , and a funded program to modernize our nuclear infrastructure . 
[LOC UK  ] interlocutors made clear they would welcome [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC CTBT  ] ratification , which would be a tangible sign to the world of [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to nuclear nonproliferation . 
[PER McDonald  ] noted that since the 1993 Executive Order , the [LOC U.S.  ] has acted as if the [MISC CTBT  ] had been ratified , which he characterized as an argument that could persuade reluctant senators . 
[LOC UK  ] interlocutors also sought an update from [PER Tauscher  ] on the progress of START negotiations and the status of the [ORG NPR  ] . 
[ORG International Atomic Energy Agency  ] ( [ORG IAEA  ] ) ----------------------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) “We need to put some steel in Director [PER General-elect Amano  ] , ” [PER Miliband  ] opined . 
[PER Amano  ] has a key role and he “must be a leader and a consensus-builder who reports faithfully what experts tell him.” [PER McDonald  ] observed that the [ORG IAEA  ] seems more prepared than it has in the past to address [MISC Iranian  ] conduct . 
[PER Tauscher  ] agreed we need to make [PER Amano  ] a success . 
[ORG Russia-Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty  ] ( [MISC START  ] ) --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Leslie  ] commended [MISC U.S.-Russian  ] progress on the [ORG Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty  ] ( [MISC START  ] ) talks . 
She said that the [LOC UK  ] was looking for the [LOC U.S.  ] to deal with [LOC Russia  ] since “our relations ( with [LOC Russia  ] ) are very poor.” [PER Leslie  ] said that despite [LOC UK-Russia  ] bilateral problems , HMG would be able to work with [LOC Russia  ] through the NPT process and she expressed hope that [LOC Russia  ] “could do the right thing” to address global proliferation . 
She noted the [MISC Russian  ] proposal for a conference that could help address [MISC Egyptian  ] concerns . 
Day opined that after START negotiations are successfully concluded , [LOC Russia  ] might be inclined to seek “another deal” in regard to Conventional Forces in [LOC Europe  ] ( [ORG CFE  ] ) , since such discussions would “keep them at the top table” in terms of negotiations . 
[LOC China  ] , [LOC Pakistan  ] --------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Leslie  ] flagged the “inconvenient truth” that “China is building its nuclear arsenal.” She evoked an arms race in the [LOC Pacific  ] in light of India’s nuclear program . 
Nonetheless , [PER Leslie  ] said she was optimistic regarding China’s commitment to multilateral cooperation and she suggested that the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [LOC UK  ] should push [LOC China  ] for progress “until they say ‘stop it’.” She noted that the [MISC Chinese  ] had “pretty much” said a year ago that if the [LOC U.S.  ] ratifies the [MISC CTBT  ] , [LOC China  ] would follow suit . 
Further , [LOC China  ] has “dumped” [LOC Pakistan  ] in the [MISC Conference on Disarmament  ] ( [ORG CD  ] ) , which is a “good sign.” [PER Tauscher  ] urged P5 action to get [LOC Pakistan  ] to stop blocking progress in the [ORG CD  ] on the [ORG Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty  ] ( [ORG FMCT  ] ) . <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [LOC UK  ] has deep concerns about the safety and [LOC LONDON  ] 00002198 004 OF 005 security of [MISC Pakistan’s  ] nuclear weapons , and [LOC China  ] could play a big role in stabilizing [LOC Pakistan  ] , [PER Leslie  ] said . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] has accepted nuclear safety help , but under the [ORG IAEA  ] flag ( albeit [MISC British  ] technicians ) . 
The [MISC Pakistanis  ] worry that the [LOC U.S.  ] “will drop in and take their nukes , ” [PER Leslie  ] said. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Day expressed support for the development of a “cold war”-like relationship between [LOC India  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] that would “introduce a degree of certainty” between the two countries in their dealings . 
He noted that recent intelligence indicates that [LOC Pakistan  ] “is not going in a good direction.” [LOC Pakistan  ] sees the debate about [LOC Afghanistan  ] in the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [LOC UK  ] as demonstrating that the allies lack the will to maintain their commitment there . 
The [MISC Pakistanis  ] also believe that their recent successes against extremists in the [LOC Swat  ] valley validate their belief that they can deal with their own internal problems without changing their approach toward [LOC India  ] . 
Day asked if the [LOC U.S.  ] would be “obliged” to cut relations with [LOC Pakistan  ] if the military took over again ; he said that the last time the military assumed power the [LOC UK  ] had maintained military-to-military ties . 
Day also asked for the [LOC U.S.  ] perspective on [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] , whom he described as “potentially less venal” than other [MISC Pakistani  ] leaders . 
Nonproliferation and Public Diplomacy ------------------------------------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Leslie  ] opined that P5 states are “losing the public diplomacy arguments about nonproliferation” and civil nuclear power , with the [ORG P3  ] and the P5 “being portrayed as the bad guy.” Day expressed a similar sentiment , noting that there is “no real recognition” of what the [LOC UK  ] has done in terms of nonproliferation and disarmament , “either in our own media or worldwide.” [PER U/S Tauscher  ] agreed that we all need to do a much better job of getting our narrative out , and noted that the [ORG State Department  ] has brought in new people to help to do that. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Leslie  ] acknowledged that there had been divisions within HMG about the strategy for addressing proliferation . 
In [LOC Leslie’s  ] view , the risk of proliferation is a bigger threat than terrorism but it ranks lower than terrorism on the public’s list of perceived threats . 
She flagged efforts both by states and by terrorist groups to obtain nuclear weapons . 
She cited former [ORG FS Beckett’s  ] speech at the [ORG Carnegie International Nonproliferation Conference  ] in June 2007 as setting out the [MISC UK’s  ] commitment to a nuclear free world . 
In HMG’s view , President [PER Obama’s Prague  ] speech expressed the same commitment . 
Disarmament alone ) - without successfully addressing proliferation ) - would not make the world safer , so “we need to manage disarmament , ” [PER Leslie  ] stated . 
She rejected the [MISC French  ] assertion that that the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [LOC UK  ] are “starting a ( public ) debate that is not there” by publicly addressing issues of nuclear disarmament . 
Civil Nuclear Cooperation ------------------------- <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [LOC UK  ] interlocutors noted HMG’s commitment to civil nuclear power and that the nuclear weapons states have done a poor job in terms of [ORG Article IV of the NPT  ] . 
[ORG FS Miliband  ] commented that the nuclear weapons states have a credibility problem with the non-nuclear weapons states . 
[PER Leslie  ] said that the [LOC UK  ] had demonstrated its commitment to “moving forward” civil nuclear issues , citing the [MISC UK-hosted  ] and organized nuclear fuel cycle conference in March 2009 as an example . 
[PER Tauscher  ] agreed that we should support nuclear power and nuclear cooperation in a manner that does not lead to the spread of dangerous technologies , citing our agreement with the [LOC UAE  ] as an example . 
[ORG Arms Trade Treaty  ] ( [ORG ATT  ] ) ----------------------- <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG FS Miliband  ] asked about the status of the [ORG Arms Trade Treaty  ] ( [ORG ATT  ] ) , insisting “we are not trying to keep people from bearing arms in the USA.” He asked if it was “conceivable” for the [LOC U.S.  ] to ratify the treaty . 
[PER Tauscher  ] stated she was not optimistic given the Second Amendment issues being raised by opponents , but said the [ORG Administration  ] was planning to review the [ORG ATT  ] and we are prepared to listen to the [LOC UK  ] make its case on this issue . 
[ORG FS Miliband  ] said that the [LOC UK  ] launched its campaign in favor of the [ORG ATT  ] in September 2008 with the support of some [LOC U.S.  ] companies . 
[LOC LONDON  ] 00002198 005 OF 005 <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Day observed that there is “sometimes a sense” that the [ORG FCO  ] “pushes” the [ORG ATT  ] while the [ORG MOD  ] opposes it . 
He stressed that the [ORG MOD  ] and the [LOC UK  ] defense industry “support strongly” the [ORG ATT  ] . 
He said that he had personally seen the impact of [MISC MANPADS  ] in [LOC Sierra Leone  ] , and stated that ground to air missile proliferation is a major problem that the [ORG ATT  ] could address. “Given our operational deployments in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , we’re focused on” the [ORG ATT  ] , ” he said . 
[ORG NATO  ] - [ORG Strategic Concept  ] ------------------------ <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Day raised the [ORG NATO Strategic Concept  ] review , predicting a major debate in the [ORG Alliance  ] about deterrence and its strategic dimensions . 
A “major objective” should be “to minimize fallout” on nuclear issues . 
He noted that the Secretary General ( [ORG SYG  ] ) would prepare the first draft . 
The [ORG North Atlantic Council  ] ( [ORG NAC  ] ) will need to review the final product since the first stage of work is done among a small group of nations and many others will be “suspicious.” The direction of [LOC NATO’s  ] debate will depend on the outcome of the [MISC German  ] elections: the [ORG Social Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG SPD  ] ) could force a debate , while the [ORG Christian Democratic Union  ] ( [ORG CDU  ] ) would not , Day said . 
Day volunteered that he had been “soured” by the last two [ORG Strategic Concepts  ] . 
[PER Tauscher  ] said that the [ORG USG  ] would be addressing some of the issues in developing the [ORG Strategic Concept  ] as part of our Nuclear Posture Review. <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Day said [ORG SYG  ] Rasmussen “must not take his foot off the accelerator of reform.” The [ORG SYG  ] must be a strong leader , needs “some early wins , ” and must have the kind of access in [LOC Washington  ] that former [ORG NATO  ] SYG Robertson had , Day said . 
[ORG Defense Trade Treaty  ] -------------------- <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [LOC UK  ] interlocutors sought an update from [PER U/S Tauscher  ] on the status in the [ORG Senate  ] of the [ORG U.S.-UK Defense Trade Treaty  ] . 
[PER Tauscher  ] explained that we are working with the [ORG Senate  ] to resolve questions concerning implementation . 
Day emphasized that the [ORG Treaty  ] “matters operationally... this is the sort of stuff that saves lives.” [PER McDonald  ] stressed that the [ORG Treaty  ] was not just an agreement between two leaders , former President [PER Bush  ] and former Prime Minister [PER Blair  ] , “but an agreement between our two systems.” [PER McDonald  ] expressed appreciation for [MISC Tauscher’s  ] affirmation that implementing legislation is not necessary for the [ORG Treaty  ] to go into force . 
[PER Tauscher  ] replied that the purpose of the [ORG Treaty  ] was to cut red tape , and we don , t want to put it back in the implementation . 
[PER Leslie  ] stressed that the [LOC UK  ] did not want to “complicate” the [MISC Administration’s  ] efforts to get the [ORG Treaty  ] fully ratified . 
The [LOC UK  ] interlocutors expressed appreciation for [MISC Tauscher’s  ] commitment to the [ORG Treaty’s  ] ratification and her explanation of the [MISC Administration’s  ] steps to achieve that goal . 
Organization for the [ORG Prohibition of Chemical Weapons  ] ( [ORG OPCW  ] ) --------------------------------------------- -------------- <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG FS Miliband  ] asked for [LOC U.S.  ] support for [LOC UK  ] candidate [PER John Freeman  ] as Organization for the [ORG Prohibition of Chemical Weapons  ] ( [ORG OPCW  ] ) Director General .
