Chacon  ] , for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [MISC SUMMARY:  ] During an excellent and extremely cordial meeting that lasted over two hours on February 1 , WHA Assistant Secretary [PER Arturo Valenzuela  ] and NSA-equivalent [PER Bernardino Leon  ] , Secretary General of the Office of the Presidency , discussed prospects for [MISC U.S.-Spanish  ] cooperation in [LOC Latin America  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] priorities in the region during its rotating presidency of the [ORG Council of Europe  ] . 
The two discussed recent efforts in [LOC Haiti  ] , ongoing [MISC European  ] trade ties with the region , threats to democracy in [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Nicaragua  ] , and human rights in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
The first [ORG GOS  ] interlocutor to meet with [PER Valenzuela  ] during his February 1-3 visit to [ORG Madrid  ] , [PER Leon  ] received [PER Valenzuela  ] warmly , saying [PER Valenzuela  ] had " many friends " and admitting that he had wanted to meet [PER Valenzuela  ] for a long time . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Leon  ] spoke of President [PER Zapatero  ] 's busy agenda including trips to [LOC Davos  ] and [LOC Ethiopia  ] and his visit to [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC DC  ] , for the February 4 [ORG National Prayer Breakfast  ] . 
Reviewing the themes of [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG EU  ] Presidency , [PER Leon  ] said [PER Zapatero  ] hoped the May 2010 EU-Latin [MISC America Summit  ] would " transform " the economic relationship between [LOC Europe  ] and the region and he spoke of efforts to negotiate a number of trade agreements and to bring closure to the [ORG EU  ] 's pact with [LOC Central America  ] . 
Regarding the [MISC Andean  ] agreement , he said [LOC Ecuador  ] hoped for a more bilateral agreement and he described [LOC Bolivia  ] as a very difficult case , due to the coincidence of a lack of experience in trade negotiations combined with a lack of technical expertise in government . 
There had been no action to support " expressions of will " from [ORG MERCOSUR  ] . 
Regarding [LOC Argentina  ] in general , [PER Leon  ] told [PER Valenzuela  ] he shared his exact frustrations -- but agreed they would need five days to discuss. //CUBA// <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Regarding [LOC Spain  ] 's reported lobbying to replace the [ORG EU  ] 's [MISC Common Position toward Cuba  ] , [PER Leon  ] cautioned [PER Valenzuela  ] not to believe everything he read in the press . 
[PER Leon  ] did not foresee a huge change in [ORG EU  ] policy toward the island . 
He was careful to clarify statements by Secretary of State for [MISC IberoAmerica  ] Juan [PER Pablo de Laiglesia  ] ( with whom [PER Valenzuela  ] met later on February 1 ) as referencing a " internal reflection " and brainstorming within the [ORG EU  ] about a path to democratic change . 
President [PER Zapatero  ] had never met either of the [ORG Castros  ] and would not visit [LOC Cuba  ] without progress as yet unseen ( and certainly not within the next six months ) . 
[PER Leon  ] frankly acknowledged the perceived daylight between the [MISC Spanish  ] presidency and [LOC MFA  ] on [LOC Cuba  ] policy , and indicated that FM Moratinos appeared to be applying his pro-active [LOC Middle East  ] diplomatic experience to the [MISC Cuban  ] scenario . 
[PER Leon  ] admitted [LOC Spain  ] 's current relationship with [LOC Cuba  ] was " difficult " in part because the [ORG GOS  ] had had ties to former FM [MISC Perez-Roque  ] and also because the [ORG GOC  ] interpreted [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG Historic Memory Law  ] ( by which hundreds of thousands of descendants of exiled [MISC Spanish  ] citizens are expected to claim [MISC Spanish  ] nationality ) as a stroke of the pen directed at [LOC Cuba.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The two discussed how to bring about democratic reform in [LOC Cuba  ] , with [PER Leon  ] specifying he was the highest-level [MISC Spanish  ] official to have met with the most important dissidents . 
Referring to [LOC Cuba  ] 's economy and comparing the present crisis to [LOC Eastern Europe  ] prior to the fall of the [LOC Berlin Wall  ] , [PER Leon  ] speculated that offers of economic engagement on agricultural and energy issues of great interest of the [MISC Cuban  ] regime might lead [LOC Cuba  ] to accept certain conditions. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Valenzuela  ] explained that while [LOC U.S.  ] policy toward [LOC Cuba  ] was governed by law , President [PER Obama  ] 's intention was to press forward in engaging the [ORG GOC  ] on issues of mutual interest and concern . 
He cited the coordinated response to the January 12 earthquake in [LOC Haiti  ] as an opportunity to cooperate with [LOC Cuba  ] . 
The [ORG USG  ] has offered to provide medical supplies to 400 [MISC Cuban  ] doctors currently providing care in [LOC Haiti  ] . 
Even so , [ORG USG  ] support for human rights in [LOC Cuba  ] was paramount in our approach and policy. //HAITI// <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Both agreed on the importance of following up the [LOC Montreal  ] meeting and the need to triangulate assistance . 
[ORG MADRID  ] 00000187 002 OF 003 [PER Leon  ] raised the possibility of funneling half of all reconstruction aid through the [ORG Inter-American Development Bank  ] ( [ORG IADB  ] ) , rather than via the [ORG World Bank  ] . 
[PER Valenzuela  ] stressed the need for long-term coordination of financial contributions beyond the initial emergency and stabilization phases . 
[PER Leon  ] argued the [ORG IADB  ] had a greater stake in [LOC Haiti  ] and more regional experience and would be in a better position to manage the donors' trust fund in the event the [ORG World Bank  ] is called to respond to a respond to a future disaster elsewhere in the world . 
[PER Leon  ] observed that offering the [ORG IADB  ] a leading role would not prevent the [ORG WB  ] from making a contribution , and held that [ORG WB  ] President [PER Bob Zoellick  ] would understand the need to include [LOC Latin America  ] . 
[PER Valenzuela  ] seconded the argument for regional control and urged that the [ORG United Nations  ] not leave [LOC Latin America  ] out of the assistance and peacekeeping equation . 
Involving the [ORG IADB  ] would help increase [MISC Latin  ] buy-in . 
[PER Leon  ] said he was " completely in agreement " with [PER Valenzuela  ] about holding future aid coordination meetings in [LOC New York  ] without putting all eggs in the [ORG UN  ] basket. //HONDURAS// <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Leon  ] predicted normalization of [LOC Honduras  ] 's relations with the international community was on the horizon , and agreed with [PER Valenzuela  ] that the situation was improving , saying things were on the right track . 
He described the challenge of getting [LOC Honduras  ] closer to more stable states in the region in order to shore up its fragile institutions . 
[PER Leon  ] shared [PER Valenzuela  ] , s frustration and concern over [LOC Brazil  ] 's incomprehensible position . 
[PER Valenzuela  ] urged strong [MISC Spanish  ] and [ORG EU  ] support for President [PER Lobo  ] 's new government , noting that the election itself was not a sufficient solution , but part of a collaborative process to ensure a healthy [LOC Honduras  ] . 
[PER Lobo  ] 's agenda , while not easy , included worthy goals to combat poverty and [LOC Honduras  ] 's other problems. //NICARAGUA// <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Leon  ] stressed the need to strengthen political institutions in the lead up to elections , calling [LOC Nicaragua  ] an opportunity for [MISC U.S.-Spanish-Brazilian  ] cooperation , especially during the last months of President [PER Lula  ] 's term . 
He noted former President [PER Aleman  ] was " frustrated " with President [PER Daniel Ortega  ] and speculated about the political prospects for [PER Eduardo Montealegre  ] as a result . 
Everyone agreed [PER Ortega  ] was erratic and unpredictable and [PER Leon  ] noted [PER Ortega  ] was the only president in the region ( other than [PER Castro  ] ) with whom President [PER Zapatero  ] had refused to meet , had not and would not receive. //VENEZUELA// <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Leon  ] observed the situation in [LOC Venezuela  ] was getting more and more complicated . 
He suggested the international community should worry less about [PER Chavez  ] and focus more on supporting the democratic opposition . 
He expressed hope for the " real possibility " that a majority of [MISC Venezuelan  ] public opinion would turn against [PER Chavez  ] . 
He also shared his view that [PER Chavez  ] would do something to further harm his own cause if he perceived he would lose upcoming elections . 
[PER Valenzuela  ] said chavismo was more a symptom than the cause of fragility of institutions . 
He expressed frustration that the opposition had not necessarily been constructive . 
[PER Valenzuela  ] stressed the importance of discussing [LOC Venezuela  ] with other countries , urging a more pro-active approach on the part of all countries that would be more constructive than confronting [PER Chavez  ] or " playing his game . 
" [PER Leon  ] observed recent elections had gone better but shared [LOC U.S.  ] concerns about [LOC Venezuela  ] 's growing ties with [LOC Iran  ] ( admitting the [ORG EU  ] should have done more to intercede ) and about restrictions on [MISC Venezuelan  ] broadcasters . 
[PER Leon  ] indicated that [ORG EU  ] ambassadors had plans to meet with [PER Chavez  ] to make it clear that the closures were unacceptable and unconstitutional . 
He said it was harder to talk to [PER Chavez  ] now than previously. //BOLIVIA// <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Elsewhere in the [LOC Andean  ] region , despite the similarities in political situations and problems , the reasons for each country 's difficulties were very different , making it impossible to put all the countries " in one basket " or to equate [PER Chavez  ] with [PER Morales  ] , for example . 
On [LOC Bolivia  ] , [PER Valenzuela  ] said [LOC Spain  ] was in a position to promote cooperation on counter-narcotics and in other areas where the [ORG MADRID  ] 00000187 003 OF 003 [LOC United States  ] had been shut out . 
[PER Leon  ] noted the " unimaginable " political success of President [PER Morales  ] left no alternative but to focus on the most important themes . 
He acknowledged the [ORG GOS  ] had seen [LOC Bolivia  ] respond well in specific areas , including intelligence sharing , hydrocarbons , and protections for foreign oil and gas companies against exploitation . 
[PER Valenzuela  ] underscored the need to " multi-lateralize " cooperation and coordination on combating narco-trafficking to include [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Europe  ] , which were more directly affected by the [MISC Bolivian  ] drug trade than the [LOC United States  ] , where demand had remained stable or declined. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Leon  ] assured [PER Valenzuela  ] that the [LOC United States  ] would have [LOC Spain  ] , s support , especially during its [ORG EU  ] presidency , saying [LOC Spain  ] knew who to talk to in [LOC Bolivia  ] and noting that [PER Morales  ] respected President [PER Zapatero  ] , with whom he had gone jogging in [LOC Central Park  ] in September 2009 . 
[PER Leon  ] suggested that [PER Valenzuela  ] touch base with [LOC Spain  ] , s [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] , which had the most historical contact with [MISC Bolivian  ] interlocutors based on bilateral cooperation to fight the [MISC Basque  ] terrorist organization [ORG ETA  ] . 
[PER Leon  ] held that [PER Morales  ] was both more sophisticated than [PER Chavez  ] , had enough support to keep governing , and would not allow himself to be manipulated by anyone. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( U ) Assistant Secretary [PER Valenzuela  ] cleared this message .
