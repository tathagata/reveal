Petrochemical projects in the [PER Jose condominium  ] are working to secure an electricity generation capacity in the face of the current crisis . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG PDVSA  ] Finance: Petroleum AttachC ) met with [ORG Mitsubishi  ] [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] on [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] spoke freely on a range of issues impacting the energy sector . 
His comments on the bids in the extra heavy crude [LOC Carabobo Round  ] are reported in septel . 
With respect to [MISC PDVSA’s  ] financing needs , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] shared that [ORG PDVSA  ] is seeking to close several international financing deals , including an $8 billion offer from the “Icc Consortium , ” a $1.5 billion loan from [ORG Deutsche Bank  ] for a power plant , and a $1.5 billion corporate line of credit from [ORG Banco Espirito Santo  ] ( BES ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [MISC Mariscal Sucre: On Wednesday  ] , January 20 , in a signing ceremony for the petroleum workers’ new collective bargaining agreement , President [PER Chavez  ] announced that [ORG PDVSA  ] would develop the [LOC Mariscal Sucre  ] offshore natural gas fields independently . 
The bid round failed to attract any international interest . 
[ NOTE: During the ceremony , Minister of Energy and Petroleum [PER Rafael Ramirez  ] also announced that [ORG PDVSA  ] would develop the [ORG Junin  ] 10 block of the [LOC Faja  ] on its own , effectively eliminating [ORG Statoil  ] and Total from continued participation . 
The range of costs involved in other [ORG Junin  ] projects with international oil companies are between $16 billion and $25 billion . 
[PER Chevron XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] suggested to PetAtt on January 29 that neither company was willing to pay [ORG PDVSA  ] a bonus to be awarded the block and that [ORG PDVSA  ] “kicked” them out as a temporary negotiating measure . 
END NOTE ] [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated that privately , senior [ORG PDVSA  ] leadership is extremely upset with the failure of international companies to register bids . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] added that [ORG Mitsubishi  ] sent a letter to [ORG PDVSA  ] explaining why the conditions offered by [LOC Venezuela  ] were insufficient and what would need to be changed to make a bid commercially viable . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] suggested the obstacle to [ORG Mitsubishi’s  ] bid was the expected price for natural gas that participating companies would receive from the [ORG GBRV  ] ( [ORG GBRV  ] wants to buy natural gas for $1.25/million cubic foot and international companies are looking for a price above $3/million cubic feet ) . 
Estimates published in local media put [LOC Mariscal Sucre  ] development costs at over $8 billion. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Ramirez Travel:  ] After receiving last second permission from President [PER Chavez  ] to add a stop in [LOC Tokyo  ] onto his current travel plans , Energy and Petroleum Minister [PER Ramirez  ] is currently in [LOC Moscow  ] and will be in [LOC Beijing  ] through February 3 . 
He is scheduled to meet with private sector and [MISC Japanese  ] government officials in [LOC Tokyo  ] on February 4 and 5 . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] speculated that [MISC Ramirez’s  ] goal in [LOC Moscow  ] would be to advance the [MISC Russian  ] petroleum consortium’s [ORG Junin CARACAS  ] 00000147 002 OF 002 project . 
In [LOC Beijing  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] expected [PER Ramirez  ] to focus on “bringing CNPC” back in line and advancing the various [MISC Chinese  ] heavy oil projects in the [LOC Faja  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believed [MISC Ramirez’s  ] stop in [LOC Tokyo  ] would be designed to seek additional financing for [ORG PDVSA  ] , to advance the [ORG Junin  ] 11 reserve certification study ( Ref B ) , and to reprimand the [MISC Japanese  ] companies for not submitting bids in the [LOC Mariscal Sucre  ] bid round. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Jose Petroleum  ] and Petrochemical Condominium: [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] mentioned that the private sector petrochemical tenants have all been given contradictory information regarding possible electricity rationing measures that [LOC Pequiven  ] will execute . 
None of his interlocutors had heard of possible electricity rationing in [LOC Jose’s  ] petroleum upgraders . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] shared that [ORG Mitsubishi  ] is organizing a joint lease of a 25-30 MW electricity barge that could be brought in on a 2-3 year contract . 
[ORG Mitsubishi  ] believes this size generator could satisfy all of the petrochemical company electricity requirements. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that [ORG Mitsubishi  ] is also trying to confirm the supply of natural gas from [LOC PDSVA  ] to [LOC Pequiven  ] and its mixed company enterprises in [PER Jose  ] . 
[ORG Mitsubishi  ] financed a methane plant whose construction is expected to be completed within two months . 
The [MISC Japanese  ] firm has a contract with [LOC Pequiven  ] and an additional “back-to-back” contract with [ORG PDVSA  ] to supply natural gas to [LOC Pequiven  ] for the mixed company . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , Vice Minister for Petrochemicals ( and [ORG PDVSA  ] Vice President for Refining , Trade , and Supply ) [PER Asdrubal Chavez  ] reportedly told another [MISC Japanese  ] firm recently that any natural gas supply deal signed before he assumed his current position at the Ministry is invalid and that it was not in [MISC PDVSA’s  ] interests . 
The other [MISC Japanese  ] firm has been working for several years to finalize an olefins project in [LOC Jose.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) COMMENT: [MISC PDVSA’s  ] reported search for loans , lines of credit , and bonus payments for new production companies suggests it continues to suffer from a lack of liquidity . 
The failed [LOC Mariscal Sucre  ] natural gas bid round represents a significant setback for [ORG PDVSA  ] . 
That [MISC Russian  ] and [MISC Chinese  ] national oil companies did not submit bids in [LOC Carabobo  ] suggests the Minister’s travel is to ensure support from “like-minded” countries and to avoid new public setbacks . 
PDVSA’s search for financing and credit , a failed natural gas bid round , a ( to date ) inconclusive [LOC Carabobo  ] round signal , as well as the company’s 2009 expropriations of petroleum service companies and on-going service company arrears ( estimated to exceed $8 billion ) , signal that [ORG PDVSA  ] has much work to do to turn its fortunes around . 
Unfortunately , it appears that its management may not be up to the task . 
END COMMENT .
