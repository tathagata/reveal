SUMMARY: The [ORG International Biofuels Conference  ] hosted by the [MISC Brazilian  ] government in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] from November 17-21 , may have changed the focus of the international debate over biofuels . 
Despite some criticisms of [LOC U.S.  ] corn-based ethanol and tariffs , the participants from over 90 countries overwhelmingly were supportive of biofuels . 
There was significant discussion about the benefits of biofuels on economic development , the environment and energy . 
The discussions began with three days of panels made up of largely non-governmental experts examining the questions of energy security , sustainability , climate change , innovation , and trade , and were followed by two days of high-level government meetings , in which the results of panel debates were presented to the assembled delegations for response . 
Very broadly , conclusions of the conference were that sustainability is important but how to ensure sustainability is very complicated . 
Although a certification scheme received support from [MISC European  ] countries in particular , while many developing countries expressed their concerns about implementation costs and the possibility that sustainability standards will create barriers to trade . 
Other conclusions include: government mandates are essential to the development of local biofuels industries and that biofuels present an economic development opportunity , particularly for developing countries , and are key to achieving energy diversification goals . 
It was the latter point which began to take on increasing momentum throughout the conference , and likely will increasingly impact the international debate moving forward. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
There were some criticisms of the [LOC United States  ] , both for what some participants termed the protectionism of surcharges and subsidies , as well as for the perceived shortcomings of corn-based ethanol . 
It should be noted that few of these attacks originated from the Government of [LOC Brazil  ] , which was largely supportive and positive to USG goals for the conference . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] ethanol received its share of barbs for what some allege is a biofuels industry that spurs deforestation while the [MISC Europeans  ] were frequently on the defensive for lack of transparency and science-based criteria in the proposed draft [MISC European  ] Community 's directive on biofuels sustainability . 
END SUMMARY . 
DEVELOPMENT MOVES TO THE TOP OF THE AGENDA ------------------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
Developing nations were united in their desire to take advantage of the economic opportunities presented by the biofuels industry . 
Countries such as [LOC Senegal  ] , [LOC Tanzania  ] , and [LOC Mozambique  ] voiced their desire for a chance to join what [LOC Sweden  ] called " the [LOC Green New Deal  ] . 
" Many of them were critical of primarily [MISC European  ] sustainability efforts which several speakers regarded as having the effect of excluding them from reaping the benefits , both in terms of energy security and economic growth , presented by biofuels . 
Developing nations expressed a concern that rich countries , under the guise of sustainability , will prevent them from exporting higher value added products , pointing out that [MISC European  ] agricultural exports of soy or sugar , feedstock for biofuels , have no such sustainability criteria . 
A few conference observers noted that this dynamic seems to have set the [MISC Europeans  ] somewhat on the defensive , though [MISC Europeans  ] insisted that these measures are necessary to ensure continued consumer confidence and demand for biofuels . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] government had aggressively worked to ensure the participation of developing nations and paid for the travel by these countries' heads of delegation . 
The presence of these delegations expanded the range of discussion away from land use and food for fuel controversies which had previously characterized recent debates over biofuels , to include the development opportunities for poorer nations . 
Several observers noted that these were impassioned voices for biofuels expansion and would be a force to be reckoned with for biofuels opponents in the future . 
U.S.-Brazil biofuels cooperation with nine developing countries proved a positive example of [MISC North-South  ] and [MISC South-South  ] cooperation , sparking additional developing countries' interest , and an issue where [LOC Europe  ] was , again , defensive in response to calls for greater [MISC European  ] engagement in [LOC Africa  ] on biofuels . 
SUSTAINABILITY [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001553 002 OF 004 -------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
Biofuels sustainability was perhaps the most dominant theme of the conference , even subsuming the trade panel discussion . 
Discussions on sustainability focused on four major themes , 1 ) how to best address sustainability concerns , 2 ) the food vs. fuel debate , 3 ) life cycle analysis of greenhouse gas emissions from biofuels , and 4 ) trade issues . 
Regarding how to address sustainability concerns , many groups called for sustainability certification systems , others called for mandatory sustainability criteria , while others called for voluntary science-based approaches . 
Delegations noted the ongoing work in the [ORG Global Bioenergy Partnership  ] ( [ORG GBEP  ] ) as well as the proposal from the [ORG International Standards Organization  ] to develop a sustainability standard . 
The [MISC European  ] representatives by and large were insistent on the need for certification regimes but were roundly criticized for the lack of science-based criteria and transparency in their own proposed regime . 
Proponents of certification faced criticisms over how to define the standards , who would administer , and who would pay . 
Other delegations raised concerns that sustainability not be used as a means to slow the biofuels market and limit a tool to create economic development . 
While no consensus was reached as to the best way to address sustainability , it was an important step for this conference to recognize the importance of taking action . 
There were still some remnants of the food versus fuel debate , particularly among some panelists , though with a notably decreased degree of volubility . 
The [ORG Food and Agriculture Organization  ] representative , for instance , confined himself to discussion of addressing hunger through investment in rural infrastructure which could be part of the biofuels industry development as well . 
[LOC Venezuela  ] distinguished between biofuels produced by small farmers ( good ) and those produced by large companies ( bad ) . 
The Head of the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation , Secretary of Agriculture [PER Ed Schafer  ] , noted the belief that biofuels are responsible for large impacts on food prices is a largely " discredited notion . 
" The third major theme , life cycle analysis , was also hotly debated . 
Many countries pointed out that other energy sources ( such as oil ) were not subject to life cycle analysis but should be . 
Land use analysis , direct and indirect , was characterized as important but problematic , particularly indirect land use change . 
No real consensus was reached regarding how to best address indirect land use . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] rulemaking process attempting to define how to address indirect landuse received surprisingly little attention . 
[LOC Brazil  ] , in defending against deforestation allegations , announced it is near completing its ecological zoning plan which will feature three zones: areas considered prime for sugarcane cultivation , areas in which cultivation is permissible with some restrictions , and restricted areas where sugarcane may not be grown , including the environmentally sensitive regions of the [LOC Amazon  ] and [LOC Pantanal.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
Trade underpinned all of the topics , with many countries raising concerns that sustainability criteria , particularly those being developed by [LOC Europe  ] , could have a negative impact on biofuels trade and also set a negative precedent for trade in other goods . 
[LOC Cuba  ] also noted its opposition to [LOC U.S.  ] mandates and tariffs which resulted in food stocks being used as a fuel source . 
However , [LOC Cuba  ] did not repeat its previous attacks on biofuels in general and even offered to help with capacity building , pointing to its success in capacity building in the medical field . 
SURCHARGES/TARIFFS/SUBSIDIES ---------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
Surcharges and tariffs as well as subsidies came under heavy criticism for what several speakers termed their protectionist and/or trade distorting results , with many [MISC African  ] countries stressing the need for the free flow of products from drought-resistant crops . 
Most prominently [LOC Sao Paulo  ] State Governor [PER Jose Serra  ] ( see [LOC Sao Paulo  ] septel for more information on [PER Serra  ] 's remarks ) in both his opening and closing remarks , which immediately preceded President [PER Lula  ] 's closing remarks , singled out [LOC U.S.  ] policies for particular criticism . 
During his introduction of President [PER Lula  ] , he went so far as to compare [LOC U.S.  ] trade policy to a [MISC Chilean  ] priest who " preaches a lot but does not practice what he preaches , " stating that the [LOC U.S.  ] message of free trade is inconsistent with a closed market to [MISC Brazilian  ] ethanol . 
( Note: [MISC Brazilian  ] officials [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001553 003 OF 004 privately apologized to [LOC U.S.  ] delegation members for these remarks ) . 
Other speakers such as the representative from [LOC Chile  ] were more broad-based in their remarks , calling for free trade and an end to subsidies in biofuels . 
The [MISC Italian  ] Energy Minister called for biofuels to be an environmental commodity in the [ORG WTO  ] and suggested that biofuels sustainability criteria should be considered in the [ORG WTO  ] rules . 
[ORG FINANCIAL CRISIS  ] ---------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
Several speakers evoked the current financial crisis as an impetus for more , rather than less , biofuels development . 
The potential for biofuels to serve as an engine of economic growth , as well as to offer a diversified energy matrix immediately following the recent period of highly escalated oil prices , was on display as benefits the biofuels industry could bring to help alleviate the economic woes currently faced globally . 
Though many speakers touched on this , President [PER Lula  ] himself made the strongest case when he asked how anyone could erect impediments to the possibility of generating energy quickly and cleanly while creating jobs for many small farmers . 
He reaffirmed [LOC Brazil  ] 's commitment to bioenergy , noting that Petrobras' new assessments of [LOC Brazil  ] 's oil resources , confirmed that day , would not deter the GOB from developing biofuels even as it becomes an oil exporter in the future . 
He noted that biofuels held promise for more than 100 countries and said that , as a country with over 30 years of experience , [LOC Brazil  ] was ready to enter into dialogue with any country looking to promote sustainable biofuels development . 
He said no critics had managed to provide another viable solution to helping do what biofuels can do both in diversifying energy sources and creating economic development . 
[PER Lula  ] called for the conclusion of the [LOC Doha  ] development round and the abolition of trade barriers as other important ways of addressing the financial crisis . 
( Note: In a brief bilateral meeting with Secretary [PER Schafer  ] , Foreign Minister [PER Amorim  ] also pressed for the [PER Bush  ] administration to push to conclude [LOC Doha  ] for the same reason . 
) GOVERNMENT ACTIONS NEEDED ------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
If there was one element of the conference in which there was near virtual agreement , it was the need for government mandates for blending biofuels to help the biofuels industry flourish . 
It was also stressed that governments must not create impediments to trade and that they should create incentives for next generation biofuels development . 
Several noted that without the assurance of a prospective market , companies would not produce . 
Many further reinforced the need for development assistance and technology transfer to developing countries to allow them to take part in this promising new field . 
[LOC U.S.  ] INTERVENTIONS ------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] delegation made interventions in the plenary session on sustainability and during the high level government sessions on energy security , sustainability , innovation and trade . 
During the plenary on sustainability , [ORG State Department Principal Deputy Assistant  ] Secretary [PER Reno Harnish  ] expressed the [LOC U.S  ] commitment to sustainable biofuels production , [LOC U.S.  ] desire for science-based sustainability criteria , transparency in processes and rule-making , and [LOC U.S.  ] support for sustainability work being under taken by the [ORG GBEP  ] , which met in working groups on the margins of the meeting ( results of which will be reported septel ) . 
Agriculture Secretary [PER Ed Schafer  ] intervened to cite the [LOC U.S.  ] Energy [MISC Independence Security Act  ] as evidence of [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to sustainable biofuels development and cited the promise of next generation biofuels at even further reducing green house gas emissions . 
He also heralded the [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] bilateral cooperation through which we are assisting nine developing countries to develop their biofuels industry . 
He concluded that comparisons between biofuels feedstocks was not the important point , rather the fact that environmentally both corn and sugar based ethanol are improvements over oil as a fuel source . 
Dr. [PER Helena Chum  ] of [LOC NREL  ] , during the innovation panel , positively summarized the work of the [LOC U.S.  ] R&D biomass board that works across [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001553 004 OF 004 the whole supply chain , and cross-sectorally , to integrate biofuels and innovation in our market. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
[ORG COMMENT: Post  ] had previously assessed that [LOC Brazil  ] 's goal in hosting this conference was to use the event as a vehicle to counter some of the criticisms over biofuels and claim the mantle of global leader on the issue . 
While there were criticisms and [LOC Brazil  ] strategically chose to make room for all voices in the discussion , the conference appears by and large to have met the expectations of its organizers and perhaps surprised some of its participants . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] government organizers privately told members of the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation that they wanted to open up the topic for thorough examination and debate , while destroying the myths about biofuels . 
As the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Relations'  ] Under Secretary for Energy and [ORG Scientific Affairs  ] , and primary conference organizer , [PER Andre Amado  ] told the delegation , " We're not afraid of the criticisms . 
We have a strong case and can answer every argument . 
" He and other [MISC Brazilian  ] officials made it plain that open debate was their goal , with the presence of developing countries to help strategically frame the debate . 
Based on the tenor of the conference , it seems that the debate over biofuels has moved from whether to pursue this option ( due to concerns over food ) to how to do it in a sustainable manner . 
Future discussions over the issues surrounding the biofuels industry will likely have to contend with the need to open economic development opportunities to the developing world , a need that may be at odds with draconian sustainability measures . 
[LOC Brazil  ] will likely continue to encourage more countries to become biofuels producers to democratize the energy market , as well as ensure a stable global trade .
