( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: Counter to the hopes of the [MISC Icelandic  ] government , saving [ORG Glitnir Bank  ] has not saved the economy , as the krona has fallen by 15 percent over the last two days and [LOC Iceland  ] 's credit ratings have dropped . 
In the midst of the bad news , the first budget deficit since 1996 was announced and banks are trying every means possible to shore up their holdings . 
Politically , the government 's visibility has somewhat been dwarfed by [PER David Oddsson  ] , the Chairman of the [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG Central Bank Board of Governors  ] and former Prime Minister . 
Prime Minister [PER Haarde  ] 's annual " State of the [ORG Union  ] " -equivalent address on October 2 had difficulty getting attention over reports that [PER Oddsson  ] is calling for a unity coalition . 
While [PER Haarde  ] 's [ORG Political Advisor  ] dismissed these rumors , the government is struggling to give the impression that it is in control of events here . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) After the [MISC Icelandic  ] Government 's purchase of a majority share in the country 's third-largest bank on September 29 ( ref A ) , many had hoped the economic situation would stabilize and the krona 's slide would stop . 
In this atmosphere , the October 1 presentation of the 2009 government budget bill offered little comfort . 
For the first time since 2003 , the government anticipates a deficit ( approx . 
[MISC ISK  ] 56.9 billion , or $517 million ) . 
Earlier forecasts had predicted a deficit of [MISC ISK  ] 20 billion , or $182 million , for 2009 , but estimates have changed in the last few weeks . 
Further , the last time a budget bill was presented with a deficit was in 1996 . 
For the past three years , the state treasury has delivered a total surplus of [MISC ISK  ] 283 billion , or $2.57 billion . 
Further doom and gloom comes from the fact that the budget proposal was completed for printing prior to last weekend 's banking crisis and therefore does not account for the [ORG GOI  ] 's purchase of a 75 percent stake in [ORG Glitnir Bank  ] and the further depreciation of the krona . 
The changed economic situation will probably be considered in the parliament 's handling of the bill . 
After the nationalization of [LOC Glitnir  ] on September 29 , [ORG Standard & Poor  ] 's and [ORG Fitch Ratings  ] downgraded [LOC Iceland  ] 's sovereign credit ratings. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) After the credit rating downgrades , the [MISC Icelandic  ] krona tumbled nearly 15 percent from September 29 to October 3 to [MISC ISK  ] 112.99 against the dollar , which is the the weakest since the [ORG Central Bank of Iceland  ] quit restricting its movement in March 2001 . 
Over the last five days , the krona has come under heavy selling pressure , also falling 12 percent against the euro . 
In addition , credit default swap ( [ORG CDS  ] ) spreads for [MISC Icelandic  ] banks have soared . 
A wider [ORG CDS  ] spread means that yields on riskier debt rose sharply , while those of safe government bonds fell . 
The krona 's sell-off was precipitated by turmoil in the overleveraged banking sector , which in turn is posing serious risks to [LOC Iceland  ] 's overall financial stability. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) The three major [MISC Icelandic  ] banks are rapidly trying to shore up cash . 
On October 1 , [LOC Iceland  ] 's number two bank [ORG Landsbanki  ] said it will reverse its recent expansion and sold the majority of its overseas corporate finance and brokerage platforms to [MISC Reykjavik-based  ] [ORG Straumur-Burdaras Investment Bank  ] for 380 million euros , or $525 million . 
The deal strengthened [ORG Landsbanki  ] 's capital position and leaves it focused on commercial and corporate banking . 
Nonetheless , [ORG Fitch  ] cut its long-term rating on [ORG Landsbanki  ] from A to BBB , and [ORG Moody 's  ] put its A2 long-term rating of [ORG Landsbanki  ] up for a possible downgrade . 
Meanwhile , [ORG Kaupthing  ] , [LOC Iceland  ] 's biggest bank by value , said in February it would sell its asset finance and commodity trade finance businesses in [LOC Britain  ] . 
It sold part of this in August . 
On October 2 , the spokesman of [ORG Kaupthing  ] 's [MISC Danish  ] unit , [ORG FIH  ] , [PER Jonas Sigurgeirsson  ] , said the bank had no plans for further sales . 
He added that [ORG Kaupthing  ] had been very successful in raising deposits , meaning it was less reliant on wholesale funding , which has become very difficult to find and very expensive for [MISC Icelandic  ] banks in the current market climate . 
" The liquidity and the position of [ORG Kaupthing  ] is very strong , " [PER Sigurgeirsson  ] said . 
Additionally , [ORG Kaupthing  ] is still pressing ahead with its recent plan to acquire a major [MISC Icelandic  ] savings bank in order to add to its deposit holdings. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Adding to the government 's headaches , on October 2 newspapers reported that [PER David Oddsson  ] , the Chairman of the [ORG Board of Governors  ] at the [ORG Central Bank of Iceland  ] ( and previously PM and [ORG Independence Party  ] chair from 1991-2005 ) , has mentioned twice in the last few days in meetings at the [ORG Central Bank  ] and at the Prime Minister 's Office that forming a unity government ( including all parties in the parliament ) should be considered in light of the serious economic situation in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
This has raised eyebrows , while pundits have pointed out that the current coalition government [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000217 002 OF 002 enjoys a strong parliamentary majority and would be unlikely to yield to such a coalition . 
The general public is increasingly calling for action , while PM [PER Haarde  ] and the government , in press statements and interviews , maintain that the economic situation will get better . 
In a conversation with [MISC PolOff  ] , [PER Haarde  ] 's [ORG Politicl Advisor  ] put the [PER Oddsson  ] rumors down to a groupwithin the IP that wants to sow discord and possily rid themselves of their Social [MISC Democratic  ] Allance coalition partners . 
This group supposedly has never liked the current coalition and would rather re-form an alliance with the [ORG Progressive Party  ] . 
[PER Haarde  ] 's [ORG Advisor  ] cautioned that this was an " extremely dangerous time " to be playing politics and said [PER Haarde  ] would be pressing ahead regardless. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) [PER Haarde  ] 's annual policy address to the [ORG Althingi  ] ( parliament ) went forth against this backdrop on the evening of October 2 , and while offering little in the way of policy specifics was praised by leading daily Morgunbladid for showing optimism and determination in the face of the current challenges . 
While the opposition parties unanimously criticized the PM 's lack of specificity , [ORG Left-Green Chair  ] [PER Steingrimur Sigfusson  ] was notable in his cheerleading for the [MISC Icelandic  ] people to rely on their strengths and the country 's resources ( something of a departure for the often-critical [PER Sigfusson  ] ) . 
Perhaps inspired by [PER Oddsson  ] 's comments about a unity government , [PER Sigfusson  ] also encouraged the PM to call the leaders of all major elements of society together to hammer out a national consensus on a way forward. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: The general public listened anxiously to [PER Haarde  ] 's speech to hear what proposals the government might have . 
Though [PER Haarde  ] 's cautious optimism may have offered a calming effect , he will have to work hard to overcome the image -- eagerly reported by the media here -- of an inactive government shell-shocked by recent events . 
Results in securing outside guarantees or added cash reserves to back up the krona would do much to calm anxieties here , and [PER Haarde  ] and his team appear to know that the pressure is on .
