( C ) Summary: [LOC Iceland  ] 's economic collapse is spurring painful but necessary cost cutting measures by the [MISC Icelandic  ] government . 
One expected target of reductions is the defense budget , a very small part of the national budget but a line item with a high profile . 
Although a funding reduction is not certain , [ORG Post  ] anticipates a reduction in the [ORG Icelandic Defense Department  ] 's budget and a consequent reduction in the frequency of defense exercises and host nation financial support for [ORG NATO  ] air policing . 
Reductions in [ORG Icelandic Coast Guard  ] ( [ORG ICG  ] ) operational tempo brought on by the economic collapse will also likely negatively impact the country 's defense and security posture and will increase costs to nations deploying to [LOC Iceland  ] . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The [MISC Icelandic  ] government has had to ditch its planned 2009 budget because of the massive downturn in the economic and financial situation of the country . 
Although we have not seen an economic recovery " master plan " yet , the [MISC Icelandic  ] government is prudently forging ahead with consideration of internal cost cutting measures . 
While budget estimates for FY2009 are still in flux , many voices both within and outside government advocate for a reduction in the second annual [MISC Icelandic  ] defense budget , a tempting target for a parliament not accustomed to having to fund defense. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) The very first [MISC Icelandic  ] defense budget was enacted for the 2008 [MISC Icelandic  ] fiscal year ( January to December ) . 
At the then current exchange rate the defense budget was approximately USD 20M ; USD 12M of which was budgeted for the operation of the [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG Air Defense System  ] ( [ORG IADS  ] ) with the remaining money divided among exercise and other operational requirements of the [MISC Icelandic  ] Ministry for [ORG Foreign Affairs Defense Department  ] and its sub-directorate , the [ORG Icelandic Defense Agency  ] ( [ORG IDA  ] ) . 
( [ORG Note: The Defense Department  ] implements defense policy while the [ORG IDA  ] executes that policy in the form of operation of [ORG IADS  ] , exercise planning , and managing relationships within [ORG NATO  ] and [ORG EUCOM  ] . 
) Until the economic crash , the expectation was that the level of 2009 defense spending would remain more or less at this level , allowing all programs to continue as planned. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) When a senior [ORG IDA  ] official was asked by the resident [ORG EUCOM  ] LNO about his expectations for budget cuts , the official could not offer any solid information , stating that his senior defense leadership was waiting on direction from the senior executive level within the [ORG MFA  ] . 
He opined , however , that budget cuts were expected but in an unknown amount , that a hiring freeze was in place , and , although no layoffs were expected , there would be no new hiring to replaced anyone who resigned or retired . 
He further indicated that continued [MISC Icelandic  ] sponsoring of the annual [ORG Northern Viking  ] exercise and [ORG NATO  ] air policing missions - at least in their present form - were very much points for discussion. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The cornerstone of the [MISC Icelandic  ] defense program is [ORG IADS  ] . 
Public statements by the Defense Director have been , not surprisingly , in favor of continued funding , citing [LOC Iceland  ] 's role within , and contribution to , the [ORG NATO  ] integrated air defense system . 
Since [ORG IADS  ] is one program the [ORG Defense Agency  ] can cite as adding real world value to [ORG NATO  ] operations , [ORG Post  ] anticipates that the [ORG Defense Agency  ] will fight hard to sustain its funding . 
Other defense programs , however , may suffer from budget cuts. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [LOC Iceland  ] envisioned [ORG NATO  ] air policing deployments to occur quarterly and thus far [LOC Denmark  ] , [LOC France  ] , and the [LOC US  ] have fulfilled this mission . 
The [LOC UK  ] is scheduled to deploy to [LOC Iceland  ] in December -- bilateral political tensions notwithstanding -- with [LOC Denmark  ] recently agreeing to deploy here during the first quarter of 2009 . 
Up until now , [LOC Iceland  ] paid for messing , berthing , and ground transportation for visiting forces as well as ground handling for the aircraft . 
These costs -- roughly $500,000 per deployment , or a total of less than 2.25 percent of the [ORG MFA  ] 's entire 2008 budget -- are small , but have a high political profile in a country that does not have a standing military . 
Although [LOC Iceland  ] 's financial contribution to [ORG NATO  ] air policing is very small relative to the cost incurred by the deployed forces , sources at the [ORG IDA  ] and at [LOC Iceland  ] 's mission to [ORG NATO  ] tell [ORG Post  ] that [LOC Iceland  ] is likely to ask for a reduction to three quarterly deployments vice four or , in the alternative , significantly reduce or even eliminate its host nation logistic support. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Two [ORG Northern Viking  ] exercises have been conducted since the closure of [LOC U.S.  ] NAS Keflavik in 2006 and it has been [LOC Iceland  ] 's stated objective ( laid out in our [MISC Joint  ] Understanding of 2006 ) to continue the exercise on an annual basis . 
As with the [ORG NATO  ] air policing deployment , [LOC Iceland  ] as host nation provides significant logistic support for visiting forces , thus making the exercises a likely target for budget reductions . 
Given the budget issues there has been some discussion within the [ORG IDA  ] of converting this annual event to a biannual exercise. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Although reporting to the Ministry of [MISC Justice  ] , the [ORG Icelandic Coast Guard  ] ( [ORG ICG  ] ) has a significant role to play when it comes to defense and security issues in the [LOC High North  ] . 
The current economic issues--most especially the cost of fuel--have forced the [ORG ICG  ] to eliminate underway time for its two patrol vessels and its one hydrographic vessel . 
These vessels have remained pier side for the last six weeks . 
Fortunately , a local fuel supplier has agreed to a deferred payment plan thus allowing one of the patrol craft to get underway November 10 with the other patrol craft to follow shortly. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Funding shortfalls have had an impact on [ORG ICG  ] air operations as well . 
The [ORG ICG  ] 's three search and rescue ( [ORG SAR  ] ) helicopters and one fixed wing aircraft remain grounded except for only those flights necessary to maintain crew qualifications and for actual search and rescue operations . 
Furthermore , two of the three helicopters are leased from a [MISC Norwegian  ] firm and the [ORG ICG  ] has seen a 100 percent cost increase since the beginning of the year ( both fuel and lease costs ) . 
Compounding this is the leasing company 's threat to terminate the leases and recall the helicopters due to the leasing company 's perception that the [ORG ICG  ] lacks the financial ability to make the lease payments - not to mention the [ORG ICG  ] 's actual problems with converting the [MISC Icelandic  ] krona and transferring the payment internationally , a result of the collapse of [LOC Iceland  ] 's banking sector . 
These concerns have more than just domestic implications: the [ORG ICG  ] provides real world [ORG SAR  ] services for the [ORG Northern Viking  ] exercises and [ORG NATO  ] air policing . 
If reduced funding translates into an inability to take on this tasking , visiting forces will have to provide their own [ORG SAR  ] which , in turn , will dramatically increase the cost of their deployments to [LOC Iceland.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [MISC Comment:  ] The [MISC Icelandic  ] government is facing a financial and social catastrophe , and the demands on its 2009 budget will be severe . 
A huge government debt plus growing need for social services as unemployment skyrockets will require the government to watch every penny . 
We must expect budget reductions in defense spending that will most likely impact [LOC Iceland  ] 's ability to host military exercises or its financial support of [ORG NATO  ] air policing deployments . 
Post is coordinating with other [ORG NATO  ] Allies here to encourage the government to keep a long-term security perspective in mind as it looks for places to trim the budget , and to look at the optional ( exercises ) before the essential ( [ORG IADS  ] , air policing support ) .
