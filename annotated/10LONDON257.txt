( [ORG S  ] ) SUMMARY: Embassy [ORG London Iran  ] Watcher ( poloff ) met February 3 with [PER Jaime Turner  ] , Deputy Head of Multi-lateral Affairs at the Foreign and [LOC Commonwealth Office’s Iran Group  ] to discuss ways to condemn publicly the [MISC Iranian  ] regime’s blocking of western satellite channels and how to circumvent it . 
[PER Turner  ] informed poloff that the [ORG European Parliament  ] ( [ORG EP  ] ) would soon be debating a resolution condemning the [MISC IRIG’s  ] actions against [ORG BBC Persian  ] , [ORG Voice of America and Deutsche Welle  ] broadcasts . 
HMG requested that the [ORG USG  ] join with the [LOC UK  ] and [LOC France  ] ( home of [PER Eutelsat  ] , owner of the [MISC Hotbird  ] satellite ) at the [ORG International Telecommunication Union  ] ( [ORG ITU  ] ) to lodge an official complaint against the [ORG IRIG  ] for jamming commercial broadcasts . 
HMG also hopes the [LOC U.S.  ] will join it in lobbying the [MISC French  ] government to convince [PER Eutelsat  ] to drop [ORG IRIG  ] broadcasts from the [MISC Hotbird  ] satellite . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Jaime Turner  ] , Deputy Head of Multi-lateral affairs at the Foreign and [LOC Commonwealth Office’s Iran Group  ] , briefed poloff on the [MISC IRIG’s  ] jamming of western satellite broadcasts , particularly [ORG BBC Persian  ] and [ORG Voice of America  ] . 
[PER Turner  ] said [PER Eutelsat  ] , the owner of the [MISC Hotbird  ] satellite ( the most popular satellite covering the [LOC Midde East  ] region ) had , after several months of enduring [MISC Iranian  ] jamming of its signals , decided to drop [ORG BBC Persian  ] from the satellite because of complaints from other commercial broadcasters that their programs were being affected as well . 
Although [PER Eutelsat  ] has given [ORG BBC Persian  ] a slot on another satellite , that satellite does not carry many of the most popular channels and therefore has limited reach. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In an informal survey conducted by the [MISC British  ] Embassy in [LOC Tehran  ] , the [LOC UK  ] found that less than 15 percent of people in [LOC Tehran  ] have access to either [ORG BBC Persian  ] or [ORG Voice of America  ] ( [ORG VOA  ] ) television broadcasts . 
In a few cases , individuals were able to hear the broadcasts , but the pictures were scrambled . 
In an effort to reach more people inside [LOC Iran  ] , [ORG BBC Persian  ] has begun streaming all of its magazine programs on the web , but those are only accessible to people who are arguably the best informed because of their ability to circumvent [ORG IRIG  ] internet filtering . 
[ORG BBC  ] also has started producing one-minute news summaries that can be distributed via [ORG Bluetooth  ] . 
Radio has been far less affected , with regular access to [ORG BBC World Service  ] and [ORG VOA  ] still readily available . 
[PER Eutelsat  ] has lodged a complaint at the [ORG International Telecommunication Union  ] ( [LOC ITU  ] ) against the [MISC Iranian  ] government . 
The [MISC French  ] government ( [PER Eutelsat  ] is a [MISC French  ] company ) also plans to engage on the issue at [LOC ITU  ] . 
According to [PER Turner  ] , the [LOC UK  ] has not been particularly active at [LOC ITU  ] in the past , and therefore has little influence , but will join the [MISC French  ] protest . 
[ORG HMG  ] would appreciate [ORG USG  ] engagement as well. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) While lodging complaints at the [LOC ITU  ] has symbolic value , [PER Turner  ] said her government recognizes the body has no enforcement authority . 
Therefore , [ORG HMG  ] is looking at other ways to address the issue . 
[ORG HMG  ] is exploring ways to limit the operations of the [ORG IRIB’s Press  ] TV service , which operates a large bureau ( over 80 staff ) in [LOC London  ] . 
However , [LOC UK  ] law sets a very high standard for denying licenses to broadcasters . 
Licenses can only be denied in cases where national security is threatened , or if granting a license would be contrary to [MISC Britain’s  ] obligations under international law . 
Currently , neither of these standards can be met with respect to Press TV , but if further sanctions are imposed on [LOC Iran  ] in the coming months , a case may be able to be made on the second criterion. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In the immediate term , [ORG HMG  ] plans to lobby the [MISC French  ] government to approach [PER Eutelsat  ] and press it to drop [ORG IRIB  ] broadcasts from the [MISC Hotbird  ] satellite . 
The [ORG IRIB  ] broadcasts several channels from the satellite , both domestically ( even most terrestrial TV channels in [LOC Iran  ] are dependent on a satellite and repeaters ) and internationally , so it is an important source of income for [PER Eutelsat  ] . 
While it would be unlikely for the company to agree to drop the [ORG IRIB  ] broadcasts spontaneously , [PER Turner  ] believes it would be susceptible to an approach by the [MISC French  ] government because of the cover it would gain from complying with an official government request . 
[ORG HMG  ] would appreciate [ORG USG  ] engagement with the government of [LOC France  ] on this issue .
