KEY POINTS -- ( C ) A recent series of selective [ORG GOE  ] actions against journalists , bloggers and even an amateur poet illustrates the variety of methods available to the [ORG GOE  ] to suppress critical opinion , including an array of investigative authorities and public and private legal actions. -- ( U ) A journalist was jailed on defamation charges for the first time in recent memory , and an amateur poet was imprisoned for three months for allegedly defaming President [PER Mubarak.  ] -- ( C ) The [ORG GOE  ] arrested three [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] ( [ORG MB  ] ) -affiliated bloggers , and has repeatedly used the Emergency Law to block a court ordered release of another jailed blogger. -- ( C ) The government is working with [ORG NDP  ] operatives to flood the courts with suits against political enemies , using tactics such as fabricating assault charges against a journalist and filing a profanity case against a novelist. -- ( C ) The [ORG GOE  ] 's actions are examples of where it decides to draw redlines in an environment featuring frequent press articles and blogs critical of both the regime and President [PER Mubarak.  ] -- ( C ) These [ORG GOE  ] actions , combined with arrests of [ORG MB  ] officials ( septel ) , could be the start of an attempt to tighten the political environment in advance of the 2010 parliamentary elections. --------------------------------------------- ------------ [ORG Proactive Security Forces  ] and an Unfortunate Amateur Poet --------------------------------------------- ------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The recent case in [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ( [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] miles [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] of [LOC Cairo  ] ) of [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , a local government clerk arrested , convicted and jailed for writing unpublished poetry allegedly insulting to President [PER Mubarak  ] , illustrates how proactive security forces and courts can successfully move against a civilian defended by incompetent lawyers . 
In late June , the [ORG Arab Network for Human Rights Information  ] ( [ORG ANHRI  ] ) issued a statement that police in [LOC XXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] arrested [LOC XXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] in April for defaming [PER Mubarak  ] in a poem , and a local court subsequently sentenced him to three years in prison . 
According to the statement , the court set bail at [ORG LE  ] 100,000 ( 15,000 USD ) pending appeal , and since [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] could not afford that sum , he remained in jail . 
Skilled [MISC Cairo-based  ] lawyers from [ORG ANHRI  ] appealed the case , and a [LOC Minya  ] appeals court acquitted XXXXXXXXXXX July 18 ; he was released July 20 . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] might still be in jail if his original defense lawyers had not sought help. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us he was not aware of the case until June when lawyers from [LOC Minya  ] contacted him to help with the appeal . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] attributed the conviction in part to the poor skills of the defense lawyers . 
The case remained virtually unknown until the days leading up to the July 18 appeal verdict when the local and international press began reporting on it . 
Until mid-July , even our contacts specializing in freedom of expression were unaware of the case . 
Following [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] 's release from prison , [ORG XXXXXXXXXX  ] appeared on [MISC Egyptian  ] satellite television and said [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] would not write any more poetry critical of the government . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also criticized lawyers from [LOC Minya  ] for not defending him aggressively out of fear of the [ORG GOE  ] 's response. -------------------------------- Arresting and Harassing Bloggers -------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In a blogging environment often critical of the government , the [ORG GOE  ] has selectively moved against certain bloggers . 
Most recently , the [ORG GOE  ] arrested three young , [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] ( [ORG MB  ] ) -affiliated bloggers . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] confirmed for us July 27 that [ORG State Security Investigative Services  ] ( [ORG SSIS  ] ) arrested bloggers [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] at [ORG Cairo International Airport CAIRO  ] 00001447 002 OF 002 following their return from a conference in [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also confirmed that [ORG SSIS  ] arrested a third blogger , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , at his home on XXXXXXXXXXX , and that all three bloggers remained in detention . 
The [ORG MB  ] website reported XXXXXXXXXXX that the [ORG GOE  ] released [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that day . 
The three bloggers have criticized trials of [ORG MB  ] members in military courts and have voiced support for [ORG MB  ] detainees . 
Our contacts have asserted that the [ORG GOE  ] fears young , tech-savvy MB-affiliated bloggers because of their ability to generate mass support for the [ORG Brotherhood and  ] organize rallies and other events via the internet . 
Contacts attributed the arrest and torture of young MB-blogger XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX in [LOC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ( refs D , E ) to these factors . 
Police released [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] in [LOC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ( ref D ) . <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Prominent blogger [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ran afoul of the [ORG GOE  ] by publicly criticizing the regime in late June at a conference in [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ( ref B ) . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , who was held at [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX International Airport XXXXXXXXXX  ] for 13 hours upon his return , told us [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that police have still not returned his laptop . 
[PER Hafez Abu Seada  ] , Secretary-General of the [MISC Egyptian  ] Organization for [ORG Human Rights which  ] is representing [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , told us July 22 that the police have not responded to his organization 's inquiries beyond saying that they are holding the laptop to search for " intellectual property violations . 
" [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] had told us that [ORG NDP  ] members attending the same conference in [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] reported his critical comments to the [LOC GOE.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOE  ] is using the Emergency Law to reject court orders for the release of blogger [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] whom [ORG SSIS  ] has kept in jail since [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] for allegedly insulting both [MISC Islam  ] and [PER Christianity  ] ( ref C ) . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] 's lawyer XXXXXXXXXXX told us that the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] rejected a [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] court order to release [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , and since [ORG SSIS  ] made the arrest under the Emergency Law , neither the courts nor attorneys have any recourse . 
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX commented that this is the fifth time the [ORG MOI  ] has refused to follow court decisions ordering [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] 's release. --------------------------------------------- - [MISC GOE Actions Against  ] a Novelist and Journalists --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOE  ] and [ORG NDP  ] operatives have stepped up their efforts to file lawsuits against political opponents . 
[ORG Human Rights  ] attorney [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us in late June that he is defending the leading independent newspaper " [MISC Al-Masry Al-Youm  ] " against more than 70 defamation suits , most of which have been filed by [ORG NDP  ] loyalists . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] is also defending [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] author of [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] against a government suit alleging that the work is profane . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the [ORG MOI  ] filed the profanity suit as a pretext to punish the author for the novel 's criticism of the [ORG NDP  ] and of [ORG MOI  ] heavy-handed police tactics against demonstrators . 
The profanity suit focuses on one relatively explicit sex scene and the use of expletives . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said such content is common in books and magazines , and almost never incurs suits . 
The trial is currently adjourned until the fall. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) EOHR Secretary-General [PER Hafez Abu Seada  ] told us in early July that he is defending [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , a journalist from the weekly newspaper [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] whom he said the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] has targeted for writing a series of articles critical of the minister and other senior [ORG MOI  ] officials . 
[PER Abu Seada  ] said an [ORG Interior Ministry  ] general confronted [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] on the street as a pretext for filing charges against him for allegedly " assaulting " an officer . 
The [ORG Arab Network for Human Rights Information  ] issued a statement July 13 criticizing the police for breaking into [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] 's home six times between July 10 and 11. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) In mid-July , police arrested [PER Yasser Barakat  ] , editor-in-chief of the independent paper " [MISC Al-Moagaz  ] , " to implement a June 24 court decision convicting him of defaming independent [ORG MP  ] and [ORG SSIS  ] confidante [PER Mustafa Bakry  ] . 
In the first instance in recent memory of a journalist jailed for defamation , [PER Barakat  ] spent 5 days in jail before his July 11 release pending appeal , following lobbying by the [ORG Press Syndicate  ] ( ref A ) . 
Contacts have told us that [ORG SSIS  ] was able to provide political cover to support [PER Bakry  ] in his long-running personal feud against [PER Barakat  ] .
