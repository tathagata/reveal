STATE  ] 8676 B. 09 [LOC MOSCOW  ] 1273 Classified By: Econ MC [PER Matthias Mitman  ] for Reasons 1.4 ( b/d ) ---------------------------- PUTIN-BERLUSCONI DIRECT LINK ---------------------------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C/NF ) XXXXXXXXXXXX told us during a February 4 lunch that his [ORG Embassy  ] and his [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] often only learn of conversations between PM [PER Berlusconi  ] and PM [PER Putin  ] after the fact , and with little detail or background . 
He expressed frustration about the [MISC PMs’  ] “direct line , ” which sometimes leaves the [ORG Embassy  ] in the dark . 
He said if there is action to be taken , the cabinet secretary will instruct the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] or the [ORG Embassy  ] without providing any background , and only note that [PER Berlusconi  ] and [PER Putin  ] had agreed on whatever the action item is . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] explained that while the close relationship is not ideal from the bureaucracy’s perspective and more detrimental than beneficial , it can be useful at times . 
He cited the case of the sale to [ORG Gazprom  ] by [MISC Italian  ] energy giant [ORG ENI  ] of its 20% share in Gazprom’s oil subsidiary [ORG Gazpromneft  ] . 
He said [ORG Gazprom  ] had insisted on paying far below the market price , but that it ultimately paid the market price after [PER Berlusconi  ] weighed in with [ORG Putin.  ] ------------ [ORG ENI  ] AND [ORG ENEL  ] ------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) In response to our comment that [LOC ENI’s Moscow Representative  ] , [PER Ernesto Ferlenghi  ] , won’t meet with us , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [PER Ferlenghi  ] “for some reason” doesn’t like to meet with foreign diplomats . 
( [PER Note: We  ] had a very open and friendly meeting with [PER Ferlenghi  ] about two years ago , but ever since , he has deflected our requests for a meeting . 
See also ref B. End note . 
) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he believes [PER Ferlenghi  ] may have a directive from [ORG ENI  ] headquarters to refer foreign governments to [MISC ENI’s Rome-based  ] international governmental affairs director . 
While [ [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , his cell phone rang -- it was [ORG Ferlenghi.  ] explained that although major projects such as the proposed [LOC South Stream  ] gas pipeline gain the most attention , [MISC ENI’s  ] main business in [LOC Russia  ] is “buying gas.” <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the [MISC Italian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] is organizing a visit by a trade and investment delegation to [LOC Novy Urengoi  ] , the [LOC Yamal  ] region city that is a project site of [LOC Severenergia  ] , an upstream joint-venture between [ORG Gazprom  ] , [ORG ENI  ] , and [ORG Italy’s Enel  ] . 
[ORG Gazprom  ] bought a controlling stake in [LOC Severenergia  ] from [ORG ENI  ] and [ORG Enel  ] , which had set up [LOC Severenergia  ] to purchase some of the assets of the former [ORG Yukos  ] oil company at its bankruptcy auction . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that in addition to its investment in [LOC Severenergia  ] , [ORG Enel  ] also has approximately $6 billion invested in the [MISC Russian  ] electricity sector and may raise its investment in that sector to $9 billion. ------------------------------ [LOC SOUTH STREAM  ] AND [MISC SAMSUN-CEYHAN  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also noted that [ORG ENI  ] [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and “we” ( presumably the [MISC Italian  ] government ) have regular contact with [MISC Russian  ] DPM and “Energy [PER Czar” Igor Sechin  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that lately the discussions relate to an explicit business link between [LOC South Stream  ] and the proposed [MISC Samsun-Ceyhan Turkish  ] oil pipeline , of which [ORG ENI  ] is the operating partner . 
He explained that [ORG ENI  ] , and its [MISC Turkish  ] partner ( which he said is [MISC Turkish  ] PM Erdogan’s son-in-law ) need [MISC Russian  ] oil to make [MISC Samsun-Ceyhan  ] a reality , while [ORG Gazprom  ] needs [MISC Turkish  ] cooperation to move ahead on [LOC South Stream.  ] ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) On major issues , it seems that [MISC Russian-Italian  ] [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00000266 002 OF 002 economic relations are directed by PMs who have a direct line to each other as well as control over some of the largest assets of their respective economies . 
To whatever end they direct those assets , it is likely they are not doing so based solely on commercial or rate-of-return calculations . 
As our contact himself acknowledged -- “it seems that everything that happens at the lower levels is just for show.” Beyrle</pre></code>
