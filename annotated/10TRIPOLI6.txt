( U ) The Government of [LOC Libya  ] ( [ORG GOL  ] ) does not maintain diplomatic relations with [LOC Israel  ] . 
Local firms are required by national law to comply with the [ORG Arab League  ] ( [ORG AL  ] ) boycott , and would therefore not be able to sign the required [LOC U.S.  ] certification without exposing themselves to civil and/or criminal penalties . 
Post accordingly requests a waiver of the [LOC AL  ] boycott certification. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In 2007 , the [ORG Ministry of Trade and Economy  ] informed Post that the [ORG GOL  ] does not enforce the boycott ; however , the government continues to use the boycott as a means by which to selectively sanction foreign corporations and boycott language continues to appear in contracts . 
Bills of lading and customs declarations for imports cannot indicate trade with [LOC Israel  ] , and shippers are legally required to certify that no goods are of [MISC Israeli  ] origin . 
[LOC Libya  ] continues to enforce a travel ban for passports containing [MISC Israeli  ] visas or entry/exit stamps. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Embassy [LOC Tripoli  ] has reviewed the contractor certification requirements and determined that without such a waiver it would be unable to obtain essential supplies and services in-country . 
This is particularly critical as we re-establish our diplomatic presence in [LOC Tripoli  ] , including consolidating Embassy operations in one location .
