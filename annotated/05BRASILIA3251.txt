( U ) Econoff made reftel points on the [LOC Cape Town  ] convention to [PER Michel Arslanian  ] of the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] 's [ORG Division of Services  ] , [ORG Investment  ] and [ORG Financial Affairs  ] . 
[PER Arslanian  ] stated [LOC Brazil  ] will likely accede to the treaty , but with a few reservations since certain points of the treaty were " incompatible " with [MISC Brazilian  ] law . 
[PER Arslanian  ] , who was not versed in the technical aspects of the treaty , did not describe what the reservations might be. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Marcus Tollendal  ] of [MISC Brazilian  ] aircraft manufacturer [ORG Embraer  ] , which has been lobbying the [ORG GoB  ] in favor of accession to [LOC Capetown  ] for some time , shared with Econoff in a December 13 conversation his assessment that the [ORG GoB  ] would eventually accede to the convention . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's major airline , [ORG VARIG  ] , which is currently under bankruptcy protection and under threat of having its aircraft seized by its creditors , was opposing [LOC Brazil  ] 's accession , according to [PER Tollendal  ] . 
[ORG Embraer  ] had sought to involve [LOC Brazil  ] 's solvent airlines , [ORG TAM  ] and [ORG GOL  ] , in the political dialogue since they stood to benefit from reduced financing costs should [LOC Brazil  ] accede to the treaty . 
While the [ORG Civil Aviation Directorate  ] initially was opposed , its position appears to be changing . 
[PER Tollendal  ] believed the balance of forces was shifting in favor of [LOC Brazil  ] 's accession but did not think this would happen in the near term. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Of more concern , [PER Tollendal  ] said , were the likely [ORG GoB  ] reservations , which would affect the implementation in [LOC Brazil  ] of central aspects of the treaty . 
There were restrictions under [MISC Brazilian  ] bankruptcy law that limited a creditor 's ability to seize assets , he explained . 
While [ORG Embraer  ] 's lawyers were still drafting an opinion on the issue , accession with the significant reservations the [ORG GoB  ] was entertaining would , [PER Tollendal  ] maintained , significantly weaken creditor rights to repossess aircraft from the ideal laid out in the convention . 
He was uncertain , without seeing the final legal opinion , whether there was any basis for an accession without reservations .
