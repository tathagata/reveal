( U ) SUMMARY: Responding to international concerns over poor working conditions and forced labor in the sugarcane sector , [LOC Brazil  ] 's President [PER Lula  ] signed on June 25 , 2009 , the [ORG National Commitment  ] to Improve Labor Conditions in Sugarcane Activity . 
A tripartite dialogue between organizations representing businessmen , workers and the [ORG Federal Government of Brazil  ] developed the [ORG Commitment  ] during a year of negotiations led by the Secretary General of the Presidency , [PER Luiz Dulci  ] . 
This is the first nationwide labor accord with the entire sugarcane sector , and is particularly relevant to [LOC Brazil  ] 's interest in increasing international investment in its sugarcane ethanol production . 
However , without significant funding and action by the [ORG GOB  ] , implementation of the [ORG National Commitment  ] throughout the country depends considerably upon efforts of the private sector companies involved . 
END SUMMARY . 
Terms of [ORG Commitment  ] ------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) The [ORG National Commitment  ] addresses business practices and public policies aimed at improving labor conditions in the cultivation of sugarcane . 
The [ORG Commitment  ] requires mills to engage in direct hiring of workers for manual planting and harvesting of sugarcane , thus eliminating irregular intermediaries . 
Mills are also obliged to ensure transparency in measuring and paying for worker production , providing support and transportation for migrants hired from other regions , enhancing labor health and safety , strengthening unions and collective bargaining practices , and disclosing good business practices to sugarcane suppliers . 
The [ORG Federal Government  ] is committed to encouraging actions that ensure adequacy of [ORG Personal Protective Equipment  ] ( [ORG EPI  ] ) used by workers , improving the [ORG Public Employment System  ] 's services in hiring workers , advancing literacy and workers' schooling , promoting qualification and requalification of workers , and strengthening services in regions prone to immigration for seasonal work. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Adherence by the sugar and ethanol companies to the [ORG Commitment  ] is voluntary . 
Companies that sign are subject to inspections by the [ORG National Commission for Dialogue and Evaluation  ] , which is composed of the [ORG Commitment  ] 's signatories . 
The [ORG National Commission  ] is responsible for creating a system of evaluation and recognition for companies that carry out the [ORG Commitment  ] 's good business practices , establishing criteria for implementation and evaluation , and discussing the [ORG Commitment  ] 's revision after its two-year validity . 
According to [PER Marcos Sawaya Jank  ] , President and CEO of the [MISC Brazilian  ] Sugarcane [ORG Industry Association  ] ( [ORG UNICA  ] ) , the [ORG National Commission  ] has met twice and agreed that mills will have one year from the time they sign the [ORG Commitment  ] to comply with its mandates ; those mills found in compliance with the [ORG Commitment  ] 's requirements at the time of inspection will receive a 'conformity certificate.' 
[PER Jank  ] added that the third meeting of the [ORG National Commission  ] will define procedures for mills that do not comply with the [ORG Commitment  ] . 
Hitting the [MISC Ground Running ?  ] -------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) [PER Marcos Sawaya Jank  ] reported that in the beginning of June 2009 , [ORG UNICA  ] , the [ORG Federation of Waged Rural Employees  ] in the State of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] ( [ORG FERAESP  ] ) , [ORG Syngenta  ] , [PER John Deere  ] and [ORG Case New Holland  ] , with support from the [ORG Inter-American Development Bank  ] ( [ORG IDB  ] ) , launched the largest retraining and requalification program for the sugar-energy industry in the world . 
[PER Jank  ] told pol assistant that more than 7,000 workers in six sugarcane regions in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] will benefit from the program each year . 
4,000 manual laborers will be retrained for jobs in the sugarcane sector , such as specialized driving , operating tractors , and mechanical and electrical operations . 
The other 3,000 will be trained to work outside the sector in jobs such as reforestation , construction and tourism . 
[PER Jank  ] also commented that training will be specific to each region , allowing individuals in the unions to identify the courses they need . 
[PER Jank  ] stated that the training will be paid for by the mills and [ORG UNICA  ] , with likely support from an [ORG IDB  ] grant . 
In an article that appeared in " O Estado de [LOC S. Paulo  ] " on June 25 , 2009 , [PER Jank  ] wrote , " These are groundbreaking advances which will have a far-reaching effect and should be recognized as historic steps in the direction of a better future . 
" [PER Jank  ] told pol assistant that over 80 percent of [MISC Brazilian  ] companies involved in sugarcane production have already agreed to the [ORG Commitment  ] , accounting for approximately 90 percent of sugarcane production in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Although [PER Jank  ] remained optimistic about the [ORG Federal Government  ] 's involvement , he noted that the [ORG GOB  ] has not implemented any policies or projects , nor directed any funds for the [ORG Commitment.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) [PER Geraldo Melo Correa  ] , Special Assistant to the Secretary General of the President of the [LOC Republic  ] , commented that the programs necessary for the [ORG Federal Government  ] to meet its responsibilities already exist , but that the companies in the sugarcane industry need to implement good business practices to comply with the [ORG National Commitment  ] . 
[PER Correa  ] stated that although the [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001044 002 OF 002 mechanization process is necessary for the expansion of [LOC Brazil  ] 's sugar-based ethanol industry , it is also leading to the loss of jobs for sugarcane workers: one machine provides as much labor as 100 sugarcane workers . 
In [PER Correa  ] 's opinion , the [ORG Commitment  ] will play a vital role in helping laid-off workers find new jobs. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Despite the positive remarks and press highlighting the [ORG Commitment  ] 's achievements , skeptics remain . 
Dr. [PER Otavio Brito Lopes  ] ( protect ) , Prosecutor General of Labor , told pol assistant that he believes the [ORG National Commitment  ] will not bring about true changes in labor conditions within the sugarcane sector. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: [ORG UNICA  ] is clearly invested in improving business practices in the sugarcane sector and has taken concrete actions , but the degree to which the [ORG Federal Government  ] will actively advance the plan is not yet clear . 
[ORG UNICA  ] has undertaken similar creative initiatives in the past to address negative perceptions of the industry . 
[ORG UNICA  ] is best positioned to effect the implementation of the [ORG Commitment  ] in the State of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , where most of its members are located , but success in other areas may rely more heavily on the [ORG GOB  ] taking an active role . 
Given the [ORG GOB  ] 's tendency to announce high-profile programs with little funding or delayed follow-up , an active role for the [ORG GOB  ] is less than a certainty . 
Nevertheless , the program 's rollout demonstrates that international pressure regarding labor conditions in the sugar industry is having an effect on [MISC Brazilian  ] government and business . 
Businesses recognize that improving labor conditions is beneficial to their bottom line , and the government is realizing that the issues must be dealt with to protect its reputation and the future of [MISC Brazilian  ] industry .
