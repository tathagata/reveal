( C ) Summary: Senior MOD officials , including Minister of [ORG Defense Alan Wagner  ] , briefed Secretary of [LOC Defense Robert Gates  ] on operational plans to expand the government 's control over four isolated areas of [LOC Peru:  ] the [LOC Apurimac  ] and [LOC Ene  ] river valleys ( the [ORG VRAE  ] ) ; the upper [LOC Huallaga  ] valley ; the border with [LOC Columbia  ] ; and the northern coast of [LOC Peru  ] . 
All four operational plans combine targeted security operations with increased investment in health , transportation , and education to re-establish the presence of the state and win the support of local populations . 
The briefing emphasized the importance of [LOC Plan VRAE  ] , which is fully funded and in the process of being implemented ; the other three programs remain in the planning stage . 
End Summary. ------------------------------------- A Multi-Faceted Approach -- [LOC Plan VRAE  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On October 5 , Minister of [ORG Defense Wagner  ] and senior defense officials briefed Secretary of [LOC Defense Gates  ] on the [ORG GOP  ] 's plans to enhance security and state authority within [LOC Peru  ] 's borders . 
The [ORG GOP  ] has given top priority to [LOC Plan VRAE  ] , which seeks to re-establish order and combat the presence of narcotraffickers and [ORG Shining Path  ] terrorists in the four departments comprising the [LOC Apurimac  ] and [LOC Ene  ] river valleys , [LOC Junin  ] , [LOC Cuzco  ] , [LOC Huancavelica  ] , and [LOC Ayacucho  ] . 
The [ORG VRAE  ] produces 50 percent of [LOC Peru  ] 's cocaine and is currently under a state of emergency . 
More than 200,000 persons live in the area: 30 percent are illiterate , 50 percent malnourished , and 80 percent live in homes lacking both water and electricity . 
In response , the government of [LOC Peru  ] has secured funding to build electrical plants , roads , water pipelines , and telephone connections in 2007 and 2008 . 
An interagency committee , representing 11 ministries and the office of the vice president , supervises social development and cooperates with the military to increase the presence of security forces in the region and to control the lawlessness that has allowed the cocaine economy to predominate. ----------------------------------- [ORG Putumayo  ] , [LOC Huallaga  ] , and [LOC Costa Norte  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) A low level of economic development also afflicts the 10,000 persons living along the 1300 kilometer border with [LOC Colombia  ] that follows the [LOC Putumayo River  ] . 
Approximately 80 percent of the population lives in poverty , 70 percent in extreme poverty . 
More than 80 percent of villagers are illiterate , and more than 95 percent of homes lack electricity and water . 
The goal of [ORG Plan Putumayo  ] is to integrate the region within the larger [MISC Peruvian  ] economy by constructing roads and airports , by building primary schools , and by ending smuggling across the border . 
At the same time , the plan recognizes the need to send additional troops to the area , possibly an additional army battalion in 2008 , to aid the 2500 soldiers already posted . 
The long border and dense vegetation pose challenges for troops patrolling the region , particularly since the isolated bases in the area lack the logistical support necessary to sustain operations. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) From 70 to 80 percent of [LOC Peru  ] 's cocaine transits through the northern coast , where small fishing villages supply vessels to transport drugs to larger ships . 
Plan [LOC Costa Norte  ] seeks to enhance the navy 's ability to survey and patrol waters along [LOC Peru  ] 's north coast by coordinating surface and air operations and by pooling intelligence sources from the military , national police , and [ORG Ministry of Fishing  ] . 
The [ORG GOP  ] expects that increased cooperation will not only reduce drug smuggling but also have an impact on curtailing piracy , illegal fishing , and human trafficking . 
The MOD noted , however , that at present , the military lacks the resources necessary to monitor the illegal activity taking place. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Like the [ORG VRAE  ] , the [LOC Huallaga  ] valley contains a [ORG Sendero Luminoso  ] column -- estimated at 60 persons -- who have increased their involvement in drug trafficking and have launched attacks against security personnel . 
Plan [ORG VRAE  ] aims to eliminate the threat posed by [ORG Sendero Luminoso  ] by bolstering the presence of the police and by increasing investment in basic infrastructure in order to create a vibrant local economy that will undercut the appeal of drug trafficking. ------------- [MISC GOP Wish List  ] ------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Minister [PER Wagner  ] concluded the presentation by noting eight areas where the [LOC United States  ] could provide aid to the [ORG GOP  ] . 
Three involved military assistance: increased training in the [LOC US  ] for [MISC Peruvian  ] military officers ; access to [LOC US  ] satellite imagery ; and funding to allow the [MISC Peruvian  ] navy to participate in multi-national operations . 
Five requests involved bilateral assistance: the donation of a field hospital to assist earthquake victims ; additional funding to assist [MISC Peruvian  ] participation in international peacekeeping ; support for demining efforts along the [MISC Ecuadorian  ] border ; re-establishment of the bilateral riverine program ; and funding to help improve naval interdictions along the northern coast. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) In response to questions raised about [ORG Plan Putumayo  ] , [PER Wagner  ] said that cooperation with [LOC Columbia  ] is excellent -- the two sides have a treaty allowing " hot pursuit " across the border -- and the [ORG FARC  ] has not yet established a permanent presence on [MISC Peruvian  ] soil , although efforts to recruit local youths continue . 
[PER Wagner  ] noted that there are simply not enough police along the [ORG Putumayo  ] river , where thick jungle makes any kind of travel difficult . 
[PER Wagner  ] also said that a lack of air mobility , particularly in the mountainous [ORG VRAE  ] , hampers military operations . 
In the [LOC VRAE  ] , for example , only one military helicopter is operational . 
The situation is different in the [ORG Upper Huallaga  ] , where NAS air assets fully support police patrols. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The MOD deserves credit for identifying transnational threats of terrorism and drug smuggling within [LOC Peru  ] 's borders as the key security challenge facing the government . 
[PER Wagner  ] recognizes as well that a purely military approach to re-establishing state control is likely to fail , and he has pursued a multi-faceted approach that responds to the underlying social and economic causes of unrest . 
Still , the greatest challenge for the [ORG GOP  ] is to translate well-meaning and crucial strategic plans into concrete action . 
Plan [ORG VRAE  ] , for example , was launched in December 2006 and has yet to get off the ground . 
The three other plans are still on the drawing boards , with the laborious process of obligating funds still pending . 
President [PER Alan Garcia  ] 's first year in office has shown that while securing funding is a necessary first step in creating change , much will depend on implementation .
