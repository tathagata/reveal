[LOC LA PAZ  ] 2036 ( [ORG NOTAL  ] ) [ORG Classified By: Political Counselor  ] Stephen [PER M. Liston  ] , reason 1.4 ( b ) an d ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [ORG PolCounselor  ] delivered ref A demarche on September 22 to the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry South America  ] 1 [ORG Division ( Mercosul countries  ] ) Chief , Minister [PER Joao Luis Pereira Pinto  ] , who is handling all of [LOC South America  ] in the absence of his counterpart who handles the [LOC Andes  ] and Under Secretary for [LOC South America  ] [PER Enio Cordeiro  ] . 
( [PER Note: Per  ] ref B , [ORG PolCounselor  ] had previously delivered the demarche to the presidency on September 19 . 
) [ORG Pinto  ] thanked [ORG PolCounselor  ] for the information on the expulsions and indicated that he thought the [LOC U.S.  ] response was entirely appropriate. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Despite local press reports that negotiations between the [MISC Bolivian  ] government and opposition were stalled , [ORG Pereira Pinto  ] said that the press was overstating the problems . 
Although the talks were difficult and patience would be required , he said that it was essential to keep the parties at the negotiating table . 
[ORG Pereira Pinto  ] thought that the [MISC Catholic  ] Church had the most credibility with both sides and would therefore have a key role in keeping negotiations moving . 
He confirmed that Ambassador [PER Macedo Soares  ] , a former Under Secretary for [LOC South America  ] , was leading [LOC Brazil  ] 's delegation to observe the talks . 
[ORG Pereira Pinto  ] also said that , as head of the [ORG UNASUL  ] " logistics " committee ( one of three created at the September 15 emergency meeting ) , Brazilin Defense Minister [PER Nelson Jobim  ] would host the [MISC Bolivian  ] Defense Minister on September 25 . 
The goal is to see what type of material support the [ORG GOB  ] needs , and to pass these requests along to other [ORG UNASUL  ] countries. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) PolCouns asked about the number of people coming across the border into [LOC Brazil  ] as a result of the instability . 
[ORG Pereira Pinto  ] said that there are no hotels rooms left in [LOC Brasileia  ] , the border town in the [MISC Brazilian  ] state of [LOC Acre  ] across from [LOC Bolivia  ] 's [ORG Pando Department  ] , but described this as an indication that most of those crossing were middle class or above and able to care for themselves . 
He indicated that the numbers of those seeking shelter in Brazil--including both [MISC Bolivians  ] and [MISC Brazilian  ] farmers--were small enough that it was not a problem . 
[ORG Pereira Pinto  ] confirmed that [MISC Bolivians  ] enjoy de facto access to [MISC Brazilian  ] social services even though an agreement providing legal access has not yet been signed . 
Asked about any official requests for asylum or refugee status , [ORG Pereira Pinto  ] said he was not aware of any . 
He added that there was no truth to news reports that the [MISC Bolivian  ] Government had requested the [MISC Brazilian  ] government return [MISC Bolivian  ] citizens allegedly involved in anti-government violence in [LOC Pando.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG Comment:  ] The [ORG GOB  ] is eager to promote a peaceful resolution to the [LOC Bolivia  ] crisis and help restore stability . 
Nonetheless , the [ORG GOB  ] is walking a difficult line . 
Sensitive to protect what it sees as the overriding principles of non-interference and sanctity of borders , the [ORG GOB  ] is supporting the " constitutional government " in [LOC Bolivia  ] and insisting that the [MISC Bolivian  ] government should determine how the international community plays a role . 
Although the [ORG GOB  ] sees this as the best way to keep a lid on the crisis and encourage [PER Evo Morales  ] to stay at the negotiating table , the [ORG GOB  ] 's support for the [MISC Bolivian  ] government , particularly if it extends to material support , may undermine its credibility with the opposition as a neutral partner . 
At the same time , [MISC Brazilians  ] in states bordering [LOC Bolivia  ] strongly support the [MISC Bolivian  ] opposition , [MISC Brazilian  ] commercial interests remain at risk from violence , and the [ORG GOB  ] has already taken criticism domestically for its previous " appeasement " of [PER Morales  ] . 
For the [ORG GOB  ] , the safest route is support for dialogue in [LOC Bolivia  ] , in its capacity as a member of [ORG UNASUL  ] . 
Even should talks break down and violence increase , however , the [ORG GOB  ] is likely to maintain its support for the " constitutional government , " absent egregious , public , and continuing violations of human rights .
