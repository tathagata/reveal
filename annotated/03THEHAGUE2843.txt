End summary . 
New Foreign Minister , Same Foreign Policy ------------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Balkenende  ] said that [PER Ben Bot  ] , set to replace outgoing FM de [PER Hoop Scheffer  ] on December 3 , would maintain the government 's priorities in foreign affairs: [MISC European  ] integration , the trans-Atlantic relationship , and continuity in [LOC Middle East  ] policy . 
[PER Balkenende  ] said [PER Bot  ] is indeed a [MISC Europeanist  ] , having spent the past ten years as [MISC Dutch  ] Ambassador to the [ORG EU  ] , but will be strong in maintaining trans-Atlantic ties and will maintain the existing division of labor with the State Secretary for [MISC European  ] Affairs . 
[PER Balkenende  ] cautioned that [PER Bot  ] would have his hands full in the first few months of his tenure . 
His first order of business is establishing himself with the [ORG Parliament  ] and preparing for the [ORG EU  ] Presidency . 
He also needs to invest in establishing his management of the [ORG Ministry and  ] to travel abroad , including to [LOC Washington  ] . 
[PER Balkenende  ] noted that he himself would travel to the [LOC US  ] in March to receive an award at [LOC Princeton  ] and planned to make a major speech on trans-Atlantic relations at that time . 
[MISC Dutch  ] '04 [ORG EU  ] Presidency ------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Sobel  ] asked what initiatives the [MISC Dutch  ] could take during their presidency in support of the [MISC US-European  ] relationship . 
The Justice Minister , who had recently met with DHS Secretary Ridge , had confirmed that [MISC Dutch  ] would be working on Justice and Home Affairs ( [ORG JHA  ] ) issues during their presidency and agreed that perhaps there could be progress on the [MISC US-EU  ] track . 
[PER Swartbol  ] said that the [ORG GONL  ] had not made decisions yet about any trans-Atlantic initiatives , but a [MISC US-EU  ] effort on border control and justice issues would fit the [MISC Dutch  ] emphasis on internal and external security . 
He cautioned that the arrival of a new slate of [ORG EU  ] Commissioners in November '04 would complicate and delay things . 
PM [PER Balkenende  ] said that he and [MISC Irish  ] PM [MISC Ahern  ] had discussed the question of whether the [MISC Dutch  ] would begin the process of designing a program to follow [LOC Tampere  ] -- the [ORG JHA  ] multiyear plan that would be completed and reviewed during the [MISC Irish  ] Presidency . 
In order to get anything done in the second half of '04 , the [MISC Irish  ] would have to do the preparatory work . 
[PER Balkenende  ] said he would ask his people to look at the possibilities. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The Ambassador urged the PM to stay engaged in the trans-Atlantic partnership and show leadership in [LOC Europe  ] . 
Wrapping up on the [ORG EU  ] Presidency , [PER Balkenende  ] said that the government is increasingly busy in its preparations , although he invited the Ambassador to contact him when there are important [LOC US  ] issues . 
The cabinet now meets monthly to review Presidency preparations , and the pace of those meetings will accelerate . 
[PER Balkenende  ] listed the following [MISC Dutch  ] priorities for the second semester of '04: - - Enlargement - [LOC Bulgaria  ] , [LOC Romania  ] , and [LOC Turkey  ] ; - - The new [ORG European Commission  ] and [ORG Parliament  ] ; - - [LOC Lisbon  ] 2000 ( economic ) , [LOC Tampere  ] , and [ORG Common Security  ] and Foreign Policy ( CSFP ) ; - - Deregulation in [LOC Europe  ] ; and - - Promoting social values in [LOC Europe  ] . 
Other issues -------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) ICC: The Ambassador also raised the [ORG ICC  ] , noting that the [ORG UN  ] arrangements will again expire in June , risking a [MISC US-EU  ] confrontation . 
The [LOC US  ] position will not change , so wouldn't it be better for the [ORG European Council Presidency  ] to deal with this ? 
[PER Balkenende  ] replied that it would be very hard to imagine the [ORG EU  ] accepting [ORG Article  ] 98 agreements with the [LOC US  ] . 
The [MISC American  ] perspective on the [ORG ICC  ] is very different and will not change ; [MISC Dutch  ] political support for it is strong . 
[PER Swartbol  ] added that since the [LOC Netherlands  ] is the host country , it is very difficult for the government to engage on this matter . 
[LOC Europe  ] does not want conflict with the [LOC US  ] over the [ORG ICC  ] , but objects to pressure and publicizing <a id='parA' href='#parA'>¶</a>A . 
98 agreements by other countries . 
[ORG DCM  ] responded that the [LOC US  ] was not seeking to undermine the [ORG ICC  ] and that [ORG EU  ] countries individually wanted to find a way out of the confrontation with the [LOC US  ] over the [ORG ICC  ] . 
The treaty itself provided the answer in [ORG Article  ] 98 and we would welcome quiet [MISC Dutch  ] efforts with its [ORG EU  ] partners to break the stalemate. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Economics: Sobel  ] briefed the PM on plans for a high-level trade mission by [MISC Dutch  ] companies to [LOC Silicon Valley  ] . 
[PER Balkenende  ] confirmed that he would address the group via video and expressed interest in meeting with the mission when it returned . 
He described the government 's efforts to increase private R&D spending , eliminate barriers to foreign scientists coming to [MISC Dutch  ] universities , and otherwise increase competitiveness in the short and the long term. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Iraq: [PER Balkenende  ] asked if the [ORG Madrid Conference  ] had been successful . 
Ambassador replied that it had been very positive and a number of countries had risen to the challenge at the last minute . 
[ORG DCM  ] noted that there had been valuable consultations in and on the margins of the conference . 
The [MISC Iraqi  ] Planning Minister [PER al Hafidh  ] , who visited the [LOC Netherlands  ] in October , had just been named Minister of Development and [ORG International Cooperation  ] - was the [ORG GoNL  ] planning to do more in helping to grow the [MISC Iraqi  ] economy and build infrastructure ? 
[PER Sobel  ] said that [MISC Dutch  ] industry has been signaling its interest and was looking for leadership from the government . 
[PER Balkenende  ] replied that Economic Affairs Minister [PER Brinkhorst  ] was the person who should be developing opportunities for [MISC Dutch  ] companies and promised he would raise the issue. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The Ambassador probed [MISC Dutch  ] thinking on the [LOC Middle East  ] in the run-up to their [ORG EU  ] Presidency . 
[PER Balkenende  ] said that any effort in the [LOC Middle East Peace Process  ] would need to be carefully prepared and depended on whether the two parties were ready to negotiate seriously . 
Picking up the point previously made to the [MISC Dutch  ] FM in [LOC Washington  ] last September by [LOC White House  ] Senior Director [PER Elliot Abrams  ] , [PER Sobel  ] noted that anything that reduced [LOC Israel  ] 's isolation from the [ORG EU  ] would be beneficial . 
[PER Swartbol  ] later told the Ambassador that the [ORG GONL  ] , if it decided to get involved , would think in terms of inviting [PER PMs Sharon  ] and [PER Qurei  ] ( separately ) to visit [LOC Holland  ] , probably sometime next year . 
Comment ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Balkenende  ] remains staunchly supportive of the trans-Atlantic relationship and again demonstrated his accessibility to the Ambassador and willingness to entertain new ideas . 
The conversation revealed , however , the extent to which he and the [ORG GONL  ] are increasingly consumed by the vortex of [LOC Europe  ] , particularly in the run-up to the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG EU  ] Presidency in July '04. [MISC Dutch  ] decision-making in the best of times is slow and diffused - and [PER Balkenende  ] is a consensus-builder in a coalition cabinet , not an assertive leader dominating the political scene . 
This means that although [PER Balkenende  ] 's heart is in the right place , getting him , incoming FM Bot , and other senior [ORG GoNL  ] officials to focus adequately and consistently on [LOC US  ] equities will be a labor-intensive process -- although well worth the effort .
