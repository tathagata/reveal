( C ) Summary: [MISC Bolivian  ] Vice President [PER Alvaro Garcia Linera  ] and other senior administration members , during an address to the diplomatic corps on April 21 , underscored the seriousness of what they labeled a series of three terrorist attacks and the presence of a terrorist cell with at least ten members . 
On April 16 , [MISC Bolivian  ] police forces killed three alleged terrorists in a downtown [LOC Santa Cruz  ] hotel ( reftel A ) . 
In an interview released posthumously , the group 's leader advocated the secession of [LOC Santa Cruz  ] department , [LOC Bolivia  ] 's largest and most prosperous state , but explicitly denied having any plans to attack [LOC La Paz  ] or overthrow the government . 
Nevertheless , [PER Garcia Linera  ] repeatedly pledged to carry the investigation to its " final conclusions , " raising fears of possible arrests of members of the [MISC Santa Cruz-based  ] political opposition . 
President [PER Evo Morales  ] rejected requests by the [MISC Hungarian  ] , [MISC Irish  ] , and [MISC Croatian  ] governments to investigate the three deaths , saying they had no right to demand explanations . 
Charge reassured [PER Garcia Linera  ] that there was no [ORG USG  ] involvement as per President [PER Obama  ] 's recent public statement ; the Vice President responded that the GOB knows that the [ORG USG  ] is with them . 
Striking his chest for emphasis , [PER Garcia Linera  ] said " President [PER Obama  ] 's words brought us here .

( C ) Following the deaths of three and arrest of two alleged terrorists April 16 in [LOC Santa Cruz  ] by the [MISC Bolivian  ] SWAT team ( reftel A ) , the [MISC Bolivian  ] government has released preliminary results of its ongoing investigation into what it claims is a cell of at least ten terrorists . 
The government said the group is also responsible for recent attacks on the homes of Deputy Autonomy Minister [PER Saul Avalos  ] and Cardinal [PER Julio Terrazas  ] . 
In a packed meeting of the diplomatic corps April 21 in the [LOC Presidential Palace  ] 's [ORG Hall of Mirrors  ] , Vice President [PER Alvaro Garcia Linera  ] , Government Minister [PER Alfredo Rada  ] , and Presidency Minister [PER Juan Ramon Quintana  ] justified the killing of the three alleged terrorists and reviewed what they emphasized was just " ten percent " of the information they had captured regarding the group 's aims and activities. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - VP: " Terrorists " and " [MISC Assassins  ] " - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Garcia  ] [PER Linera  ] noted that after the explosion at Cardinal [PER Terraza  ] 's house , the government intensified its focus on the suspected terrorist cell , leading ultimately to the April 16 shootout at the [LOC Santa Cruz  ] hotel . 
He said during the raid the five men attacked the police with gunfire and explosives . 
The vice president emphasized that the men were neither tourists nor random fanatics , but rather part of a structured terrorist cell that was well-funded and trained to achieve their ultimate goal of secession for [LOC Santa Cruz  ] and the assassination of [PER Morales  ] , [PER Garcia Linera  ] , and " three ministers .

( C ) [PER Garcia Linera  ] told the group of diplomats that [LOC La Paz  ] Prosecutor [PER Marcelo Sosa  ] was the case 's main investigator and said the government would abide by the results of the investigation , including any established links to [LOC Santa Cruz  ] businessmen and/or political opposition members . 
[PER Garcia Linera  ] said the effort would be impartial and would not be a witch hunt . 
However , he pledged to take the results of the investigation to their " final conclusion . 
" ( [ORG Note: Garcia  ] [PER Linera  ] used similarly firm language after the September 2008 violence in [PER Pando  ] ( reftel B-D ) , after which the government illegally jailed [PER Prefect Leopoldo Fernandez  ] and violently detained over forty more , many of them prominent political opposition members .

( C ) Government Minister [PER Rada  ] discussed the alleged structure of the cell , including the five members found in [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
He said [MISC Hungarian-Bolivian  ] [PER Eduardo Rozsa Flores  ] was the leader of the group , that he had obtained the rank of colonel in the [MISC Croatian  ] army , and was believed to be responsible for the murder of a journalist in [LOC Croatia  ] . 
[PER Rada  ] described [MISC Irishman  ] [PER Michael Martin Dwyer  ] as second-in-command , saying he had military and security experience . 
[PER Rada  ] said Romanian-born [MISC Hungarian  ] [PER Arpad Magyarosi  ] was used as a sharpshooter/sniper . 
[PER Rada  ] referred to the two captured men , [PER Mario Tadic Astorga  ] ( a [MISC Croatian-Bolivian  ] ) and [PER Elod Toaso  ] ( a [MISC Hungarian  ] ) , as a member of the [MISC Croat  ] army responsible for the [PER Terrazas  ] attack and as the main computer specialist , respectively . 
[PER Rada  ] said that in addition to the five captured or killed , information seized by the police indicated there were others involved. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Rada  ] reported that after the gun battle , the police found pistols , dynamite , C4 explosives , and ammunition corresponding to 5.56mm weapons . 
Noting that the weapons cache found at the [MISC Cotas  ] stand in the [LOC ExpoCruz  ] fairgrounds did not include any weapons of this type , he said there were likely other weapons caches in the [LOC ExpoCruz  ] area . 
( [PER Note:  ] The [MISC Embassy  ] participates in the [LOC ExpoCruz  ] fair only through its association with the [ORG American Chamber of Commerce  ] , and does not have its own stand or storage area . 
End note . 
) [PER Rada  ] said the materiel seized corresponded to the explosive devices left at both [LOC Avalos'  ] and Cardinal Terrazas' homes , which included dynamite , C4 , nails , and other metal pieces . 
He then indicated the government had information showing the group 's next attacks included the president , vice president , and three ministers ( whom [PER Rada  ] left unnamed ) . - - - - - - - - - - - VP: We Want Your Help - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Garcia Linera  ] spoke again , saying there was much more information to be reviewed . 
He said the group had maps of [MISC Bolivian  ] military bases they apparently planned to attack , that they were recruiting other members , and that they had " specialized arms " even the [MISC Bolivian  ] government did not possess . 
The vice president said they found many photos , some including [MISC Bolivians  ] from [LOC Santa Cruz  ] and [LOC Beni  ] , and that they were in the process of identifying these people . 
He insisted the photos were not " montages " or otherwise-assembled works by the government , and that the photos also indicated there had been plans for an attack around the January 25 constitutional referendum which did not come to pass . 
He specifically referred to a photo of [PER Rozsa  ] with Cruceno autonomy activist [PER Mauricio Iturri  ] and averred that he was trained by [PER Rozsa  ] . 
[PER Garcia Linera  ] ended with a simple plea to the assembled group , saying " we want your help .

( C ) Presidency Minister [PER Quintana  ] then took the floor briefly to note that , in his opinion , the attacks occurred because the political opposition created a context in which they were possible and because the government 's authority in the area was not strong enough . 
He identified six border provinces within [LOC Santa Cruz  ] department where the government would deploy troops to strengthen control. - - - - - - - - Questions Remain - - - - - - - - <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Despite the [ORG GOB  ] 's coordinated presentation that maintained the group 's intentions to assassinate the president , in an interview with [MISC Hungarian  ] television ( released posthumously and characterized as his " final testimony " ) , [PER Rozsa  ] explicitly stated he did not seek to attack the central government in [LOC La Paz  ] or to assassinate [PER Morales  ] or other administration officials . 
In a conversation with Charge after the administration 's presentation , the [MISC German  ] [ORG DCM  ] remarked that it seemed there was " not enough " to justify the government 's claims of a well-funded terrorist network , given that the supposed terrorists were easily captured and did not appear to be well trained. - - - - - - - - - - - Charge Press Statement - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) After the presentation , Charge met briefly with the press , saying that " if asked " the [ORG USG  ] would be pleased to study potential assistance we could give to the investigation . 
The [MISC Cubans  ] offered assistance as well. - - - - - - - - - - - - - [PER Morales  ] Gets Mad at [LOC Europe  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) In a press conference later on April 21 , President [PER Morales  ] bristled at requests by the governments of [LOC Hungary  ] , [LOC Ireland  ] , and [LOC Croatia  ] for more information about the deaths of their citizens . 
[PER Morales  ] said the three countries " have no authority to ask me for an explanation.. . 
I am tempted to sue them , that is what I want to do , but I am not a lawyer . 
How can they defend people who came here to attack the president ? 
That is very grave . 
I could think that they ( the governments ) were the ones who sent them in to attack me , to attack democracy . 
" [MISC Irish  ] Foreign Minister [PER Michael Martin  ] said [PER Morales  ] was being unreasonable and mentioned evidence suggesting the three men died in an " ambush " and not in a prolonged gun battle . 
Similarly , [MISC Hungarian  ] Foreign Minister [PER Peter Balazs  ] said he doubted [PER Rozsa  ] and the others were plotting assassinations . 
" We can assume they were the victims of domestic [MISC Bolivian  ] politics , " he said. - - - - Comment - - - - <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) While the existence of a paramilitary group dedicated to the defense and potential secession of [LOC Santa Cruz  ] seems clear , the other goals attributed to the group by the [MISC Bolivian  ] government are more difficult to verify . 
Observers fear the government may leverage the group 's presence to go after the political opposition in [LOC Santa Cruz  ] , similar to their round-up of [PER Pando  ] political opposition . 
Just as in [PER Pando  ] , the government has claimed sole prosecution authority falls in the hands of police and investigators from [LOC La Paz  ] . 
Post notes that ex-Pando Prefect ( and [PER Morales  ] rival ) [PER Fernandez  ] has now been in prison for seven months under dubious legal pretext and without a trial . 
We are also wary , given the president 's penchant for accusing the [MISC Embassy  ] of supporting the opposition ( and despite the vice president 's chest-pounding affirmation to Charge ) , of a potential [ORG GOB  ] accusation that the [MISC Embassy  ] or the [ORG USG  ] generally supported [PER Rozsa  ] 's " terrorist " attacks .
