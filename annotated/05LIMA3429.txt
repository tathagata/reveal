( C ) Mr. Secretary , both my country team and the [MISC Peruvian  ] Government are delighted that you are able to visit [LOC Peru  ] . 
Within hours of learning that you would be stopping in [LOC Lima  ] , President [LOC Toledo  ] called me to say how important your visit is to him . 
The President has recently become concerned about the erosion of his security capabilities . 
He recognizes that [MISC Peruvian  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] national security interests in [LOC South America  ] are closely aligned , and that his military needs both our example ( a capable security force subject to strict control by elected governments ) and our help. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The [MISC Peruvian  ] military is a troubled institution that , to borrow a clich , won a war but lost the peace . 
In the early 1990s , the military played a role at least equal to that of the police in defeating the [ORG Sendero Luminoso  ] terrorist group -- a conflict that cost an estimated 60,000 lives . 
On the heels of that victory , however , the top military leadership engaged in an orgy of corruption as the [ORG Armed Forces  ] " updated " their weapons systems . 
The most controversial procurement was the purchase of clapped-out and overpriced [MISC MIG-29  ] and [MISC SU-27  ] aircraft from [LOC Belarus  ] . 
The military also lost public support over its alliance with [PER Fujimori  ] , s scheming and manipulative intelligence chief , [PER Vladimiro Montesinos  ] , and was further marginalized by allegations of human rights abuses during the struggle against terrorism . 
After President [PER Fujimori  ] resigned in October 2000 to be replaced by an opposition-led interim government , over 30 flag-rank officers were indicted for corruption or abuse of power. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) These scandals made the [ORG Toledo Administration  ] determined to clip the [ORG Armed Forces  ] , wings . 
During his first three years in office , President [LOC Toledo  ] viewed his military largely from a political rather than security perspective . 
He reapportioned some 25 percent of the military budget to social spending , purged senior officers who had been overly intimate with the discredited [PER Fujimori  ] regime , and ended the unpopular draft . 
Last January , s armed uprising in provincial [LOC Andahuaylas  ] by " [MISC Ethnocaceristas  ] " ( a small but violent and racist group that models itself on [PER Hitler  ] , s brownshirts ) brought home to the President that he had sapped the military , s ability to defend the state . 
The [ORG Army  ] had to use the Presidential jet to get more troops on the ground because all of its own transport aircraft were inoperable. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) We estimate that 85 percent of the [ORG Armed Forces  ] budget in 2004 was spent on salaries , food and utilities . 
Training , maintenance and readiness all have steeply eroded . 
Although Defense Minister [PER Chiabra  ] believes in keeping the current voluntary service , about 30 percent of [ORG Army  ] billets are unfilled because of the inability to pay competitive wages , even though forces have been downsized by 25 percent from 2001 levels . 
Concern that things have gone too far led the [ORG Toledo Administration  ] last year to establish a special defense fund financed by state mining and hydrocarbon royalties . 
This will effectively bump up the military budget by about four percent , but the real importance to the services is that it provides an alternative to having virtually no maintenance and acquisition funds. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [ORG Armed Forces  ] have made some steps towards reform . 
Enhanced civilian control is reflected in the [ORG Congress  ] 's work on updating mission priorities , i.e. , conflict scenarios , deployment of forces , national defense interests , dealing with contraband , and pacification of social conflicts . 
Additional legislation is needed to promote standardization , civilian hiring , and in an area key to [LOC U.S.  ] interests , the capability to interact effectively on programming with foreign military services . 
The [ORG Defense Ministry  ] published a " [MISC White Book  ] " on national security this year , which although criticized by some as mainly a collection of statistics , does provide a context for defining [LOC Peru  ] 's future military needs . 
Another encouraging , outward-looking trend is [LOC Peru  ] 's deployment of troops for [LOC Haiti  ] peacekeeping , its first participation in a [ORG PKO  ] in 30 years. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Overall , our military relationship with [LOC Peru  ] is better than at any time over the last four decades . 
The [ORG Velasco  ] dictatorship , s decision in the 60 's to buy [MISC Soviet  ] created problems that have consequences to this day: adherence to outdated [MISC Soviet  ] doctrine ; atrophying of the logistics , training and exchange relationships with the [LOC U.S.  ] ; an antiquated and unreliable stock of [MISC Soviet  ] equipment . 
The situation is now ripe , however , for a new and strong relationship with [LOC U.S.  ] Both the [ORG Peruvian Armed Forces  ] and [ORG Toledo Administration  ] share our view of threats to the region , particularly narco-terrorist ties in [LOC Colombia  ] and within [LOC Peru  ] . 
GOP cooperation with the [ORG GOC  ] is the best in the region -- [LOC Peru  ] has deployed patrol and support units along the [LOC Putumayo River  ] , and cooperates closely with the [MISC Colombians  ] on operations . 
[MISC Peruvians  ] are convinced that they have a stake in President [PER Uribe  ] , s successful campaign against the [ORG FARC  ] . 
The President and the Defense Minister have called for more regional cooperation against drugs and terrorism and are concerned as well that the rump armed [ORG Sendero Luminoso  ] faction ( some 250-500 combatants ) may be rebuilding. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) We have moved in recent years toward relations with [LOC Peru  ] built on a broad communality of interests . 
We are close to signing an agreement for enhancing [LOC Peru  ] 's counterdrug participation through the [ORG Cooperating Nation Information Exchange System  ] ( [ORG CNIES  ] ) . 
Despite Article 98 restrictions , we have cooperation programs that include 1033 assistance , provision of [MISC C-26  ] aircraft for counterdrug missions , and navy sub participation in [ORG USG  ] training exercises . 
We also expect to carry out a [MISC New Horizons  ] civic/humanitarian exercise ( [ORG NH-06  ] ) here next year with extensive [MISC GOP  ] involvement . 
Completing [ORG NH-06  ] will constitute an important turn-around . 
A [MISC New Horizons  ] exercise was spiked here in 2002 due to allegations by a left-leaning Congressman ( spun up wildly in the media ) that we were attempting to establish a military base in the coca zone . 
When these charges were further complicated by the failure of the then-Foreign Minister to defend the exercise ( despite prior consultations ) , we were forced to stand down . 
[ORG NH-06  ] is being planned in a coastal department governed by a leftist leader who is friendly both to the [LOC U.S  ] and to our military , and who is highly respected by the local populace . 
Both he and we have carried out extensive preparations and outreach designed to ensure that [ORG NH-06  ] will be a winner. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Even with these advances , [LOC Peru  ] 's failure to enter into an Article 98 agreement has restricted our engagement on defense issues . 
We are discussing with the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] proposals aimed at providing the protections we require through an exchange of diplomatic notes that would " develop " provisions that already exist in our 1952 Bilateral [ORG Military Assistance Agreement  ] . 
This would avoid the necessity of submitting a separate [ORG Article  ] 98 agreement to the [MISC Peruvian  ] [ORG Congress  ] , where passage would be difficult at best . 
This approach has given us some negotiating momentum , but we ask your help in stressing the importance of an Article 98 agreement in contacts with President [LOC Toledo.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Your trip gives us a chance to highlight and build on our politico-military agenda here . 
We expect [ORG Toledo  ] and Defense Minister [PER Chiabra  ] to tell you of their concerns over the narco-terrorist link . 
In describing [LOC Peru  ] , s cooperation with [LOC Colombia  ] , they likely will lament that in their view the [MISC GOP  ] does not receive the [ORG USG  ] recognition and aid this merits . 
They are liable to express interest in continuing and/or expanding the [ORG PKO  ] in [LOC Haiti  ] . 
In addition to any global issues you may wish to raise , we suggest you address the following points in your meetings here: For President Toledo: -- Congratulations on the legacy you are leaving [LOC Peru  ] of responsible economic management , growth , and reform . 
-- [MISC GOP  ] defense of democracy and its stand against transnational crime and terrorism show strong and forward-looking leadership . 
A good example is [MISC Peruvian  ] insistence , during its mediation of [LOC Colombia-Venezuela  ] crisis following the capture of [ORG FARC  ] " Foreign Minister " [PER Granda  ] , that the GOV recognize its obligations to fight terrorism . 
-- The [MISC GOP  ] has understood better than anyone else in the region that the [ORG FARC  ] , [ORG ELN  ] , and paramilitaries in [LOC Colombia  ] are a threat to the region and not just to [LOC Colombia  ] ; [MISC Peruvian  ] cooperation with the [ORG GOC  ] is the best in [LOC South America  ] . 
-- [ORG Western Hemisphere  ] security is not threatened by neighboring countries but by criminals and terrorists who exploit weakness of government institutions or the vacuum of authority in ungoverned spaces . 
-- We have increased our assistance and cooperative programs during your Presidency to deal with these threats . 
The lack of an Article 98 agreement has been an impediment . 
We are making headway towards a solution and urge more effort , but we are seizing opportunities for cooperation where they exist . 
-- Congratulations on the performance of [MISC Peruvian  ] forces in the [LOC Haiti  ] [ORG PKO  ] . 
For Defense Minister Chiabra: -- Congratulations on the performance of [MISC Peruvian  ] forces in the [LOC Haiti  ] [ORG PKO  ] . 
I understand reimbursements from the [ORG UN  ] have been slow . 
We are willing to use [ORG USG  ] good offices with [ORG UN  ] . 
-- We are impressed by level of your cooperation with [LOC Colombia  ] . 
[LOC Peru  ] " gets-it " -- understand that the [ORG FARC  ] , [ORG ELN  ] and paramilitaries are a threat to the region , not just to the [LOC GOC.  ] -- ( Assuming [ORG CNIES  ] signed ) Congratulations on [ORG CNIES  ] and integration into the regional air information exchange network . 
We are prepared to send an assessment team to work on identifying priorities for bilateral investments in improving control of air space . 
-- We are making headway in talks with the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] regarding [ORG International Criminal Court  ] jurisdiction . 
It would be useful for you to let [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] know how important this issue is for mil-mil cooperation . 
-- I understand you are concerned about signs that [ORG Sendero Luminoso  ] is rebuilding . 
What is your assessment ? 
How will you counter this ?
