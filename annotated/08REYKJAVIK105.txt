( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: On May 19 , the [MISC Icelandic  ] Minister of [ORG Fisheries Einar Gudfinsson  ] ( [ORG Independence Party  ] ) quietly issued a quota for commercially hunting 40 minke whales for the domestic market . 
The [MISC Icelandic  ] Foreign Minister , along with the other ministers from the coalition [ORG Social Democratic  ] party , publicly responded that they did not agree with the quota . 
Further , although they acknowledged the decision was within [PER Gudfinsson  ] 's power , the [ORG Social Democratic  ] ministers felt the quota sacrificed greater interests for lesser ones . 
On June 2 , the [MISC Icelandic  ] media reported that 60 tons of fin whale meat ( from the seven whales caught in fall 2006 ) had been sent to [LOC Japan  ] . 
The local environmental [ORG NGO  ] believes the export was not a commercial deal but a political ploy to pressure the government for more fin whale quota . 
[PER Gudfinsson  ] said opponents of whaling would have to admit whaling is justified now that a market has been established and he did not preclude the issuance of more quotas . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) On May 19 , the Head of the [ORG International Office  ] at the [ORG Ministry of Fisheries  ] and [LOC Iceland  ] 's Commissioner to the [ORG International Whale Commission  ] ( [ORG IWC  ] ) [PER Stefan Asmundsson  ] telephoned Econoff to say that Minister of [ORG Fisheries Einar Gudfinsson  ] would quietly issue a quota for 40 minke whales to satisfy the domestic market for whale meat . 
[PER Asmundsson  ] said that this quota was based on the [ORG Marine Research Institute  ] 's 2007 recommendation that 400 minke whales could be harvested without impact on the stock . 
By the end of the day , Foreign Minister [PER Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir  ] , who is not in [PER Gudfinsson  ] 's [ORG Independence Party  ] , but rather the coalition [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) party , posted a response on the [ORG SDA  ] website . 
It said that the six [ORG SDA  ] ministers ( out of the twelve in the Cabinet ) opposed [PER Gudfinsson  ] 's decision and , in what appeared to be a veiled reference to [LOC Iceland  ] 's [ORG United Nations Security Council  ] bid , argued that it sacrificed long term gains for short ones. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Two weeks later , on June 2 , the [MISC Icelandic  ] media reported that whaling firm [ORG Hvalur  ] hf. had exported 60 tons of [MISC Icelandic  ] fin whale meat to [LOC Japan  ] . 
This meat came from the seven fins hunted in fall 2006 when commercial whaling was restarted and was presumably kept in cold storage since . 
Gudfinnsson , in comments to the media , noted that whaling opponents had always argued that there was no reason to hunt whales because the products would not sell ; now those parties would have to admit whaling is justified as a market has been established . 
He added that he did not preclude the issuance of more quotas . 
In response , [PER Gisladottir  ] said it was pointless to say anything specific about the sale and referenced her earlier statement regarding the minke quota. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG IWC  ] Commissioner [PER Asmundsson  ] told Econoff on June 6 that this was a legal trade and purely a private commercial deal with which the [MISC Ministry  ] had no involvement . 
He said that even if the [ORG Ministry knew of the  ] trade beforehand " it would not have been proper to reveal that the export permits had been applied for . 
" [PER Asmundsson  ] said that when [LOC Iceland  ] decided to resume commercial whaling in October 2006 , the ability to trade internationally in whale products was resumed at the same time . 
[LOC Iceland  ] has a reservation against fin whales being listed on CITES Appendix 1 , and post attempted to get copies of the CITES certificates for export . 
After several offices denied that they had responsibility for such a certificate , we located copies of the certificates at the [ORG Directorate of Fisheries  ] within the [ORG Ministry of Fisheries  ] . 
These certificates were filed in mid-May. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On June 7 , the owner of [ORG Hvalur  ] hf. , and only fin whale hunter in [LOC Iceland  ] , [PER Kristjan Loftsson  ] told the [MISC Icelandic  ] State media that he had not received the necessary permits from [MISC Japanese  ] authorities to sell the meat , but that the meat was already in [LOC Japan  ] . 
[PER Loftsson  ] said nothing was unusual and that customs and importation procedures take time . 
The local environmental [ORG NGO  ] [LOC Iceland  ] Nature [ORG Conservation Association  ] ( [ORG INCA  ] ) told Econoff that the company that received the shipment in [LOC Japan  ] was " resurrected " by the wealthy [PER Loftsson  ] just for this deal . 
[ORG INCA  ] believes this transaction was not a commercial deal but rather a political ploy by [PER Loftsson  ] to put pressure on the [MISC Icelandic  ] government to issue [PER Loftsson  ] a further quota. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) As of June 9 , five of the 40 minke whales covered by the new quota have been killed and fresh whale meat is available in [MISC Icelandic  ] grocery stores . 
No new whaling quotas have been issued beyond the minke quota . 
According to [PER Asmundsson  ] , the 2006 quota for nine fin whales , of which seven were caught , has expired . 
[PER Asmundsson  ] would not tell Econoff whether there was a petition for a new quota for fin whales . 
[ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000105 002 OF 002 <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: The opposition to the minke quota by half of the Cabinet was a different response from when commercial whaling was restarted in fall 2006 . 
The [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] , then in opposition , publicly defended [LOC Iceland  ] 's right to whale and only expressed reservations about possible reactions from [LOC Iceland  ] 's friends . 
Today , [ORG SDA  ] 's criticism of a fellow Cabinet minister indicates that there is concern with international reaction to whaling and its effect on [LOC Iceland  ] 's [ORG UN Security Council  ] bid . 
Whether new commercial quotas will be issued for fin whales or more minkes will undoubtedly be determined by the level of international reaction to recent events and whether an export market has been truly established in [LOC Japan  ] .
