1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary and action request . 
Please see para 2 for action request . 
The [ORG Panama Canal Authority  ] ( [ORG ACP  ] ) is expected to announce next week the winner of the nearly $4 billion third set of locks contract . 
This project is the centerpiece of the [ORG Canal  ] , s overall expansion plan . 
The three consortia bidding on this project are led by [ORG Bechtel  ] ( [LOC U.S  ] . 
) , [PER ACS  ] ( [LOC Spain  ] ) and [ORG Sacyr  ] ( [LOC Spain  ] ) . 
We are concerned that the [ORG Sacyr  ] group may have used the [MISC Spanish  ] , [MISC French  ] , and [MISC Italian  ] credit agencies to guarantee a 400 million [MISC USD  ] performance bond and 50 million [MISC USD  ] payment bond that [ORG Sacyr  ] would otherwise not qualify for , thereby disadvantaging the other competitors by masking [ORG Sacyr  ] , s true financial position , which may impede [ORG Sacyr  ] , s ability to complete this vital project. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) ACTION REQUEST FOR MADRID , [LOC ROME  ] , AND BRUSSELS: Embassy Action officers are requested to immediately approach the appropriate government authority that supervises the named export credit agencies and ask whether those agencies of [LOC Spain  ] ( [ORG Secretaria de Estado de Comercio  ] - [ORG CESCE  ] ) , [LOC Belgium  ] ( [ORG Office National du Ducroire-OND  ] ) and [LOC Italy  ] ( Servize Assicurativi del [LOC Estero  ] - [ORG SACE  ] ) guaranteed , insured , or in any way backed a 400 million [MISC USD  ] performance bond and 50 million [MISC USD  ] payment bond for the consortium led by troubled [MISC Spanish  ] firm [ORG Sacyr  ] to construct the nearly $4 billion third set of locks on the [LOC Panama Canal  ] . 
Please report back by July 7 by cable slugged to the Department and to Embassy [LOC Panama  ] or by email to [PER Marsha Singer  ] in [LOC WHA/CEN  ] and [PER Joel Reifman  ] , Economic Counselor , [LOC Panama  ] , and [PER Jim Bangert  ] , Economic Officer [LOC Panama.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Background: A  ] consortium led by [MISC Spanish  ] firm [ORG Sacyr Vallehermoso S.A.  ] , in direct competition with consortia led by [ORG Bechtel  ] ( [LOC U.S  ] . 
) and [PER ACS  ] ( [LOC Spain  ] ) has bid to build the roughly $4 billion third set of locks , centerpiece of the [ORG Canal  ] expansion project . 
Other leaders of the [ORG Sacyr  ] group include [ORG Impregilo S.p.A  ] . 
( [LOC Italy  ] ) and [PER Jan de Nul  ] n.v . 
( [LOC Belgium  ] ) . 
As part of the process , the [ORG Panama Canal Authority  ] has asked for a $50 million performance bond from all of the three consortia to verify their respective financial soundness . 
We understand that [ORG Sacyr  ] is nearly bankrupt and is being propped up by the [MISC Spanish  ] government . 
We further understand that their condition was so dire that they could not qualify for a $50 million performance bond on the open market , and the three [MISC European  ] credit agencies specified above had to provide guarantees for Saycr , s performance bond . 
However , at this point , we have not confirmed the actions of these three agencies. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
While obtaining a guarantee from these agencies likely does not violate , on its face , the terms of the [ORG ACP  ] , s bidding proposal , the fact that theguarantees , if they exist , could mask [ORG Sacyr  ] , s true condition is of concern . 
The [ORG USG  ] is supporting [LOC U.S.  ] firm [ORG Bechtel  ] in its efforts to obtain this enormous contract and bring jobs to the [LOC United States  ] . 
Concurrently , we wish to ensure that an otherwise fair and transparent bidding process is not wrongfully manipulated by the [ORG Sacyr  ] consortium . 
If [ORG Sacyr  ] is concealing its true financial condition , with the support of [MISC European  ] governments , we wish to bring that fact to the attention of the [ORG ACP  ] before it announces the winner of this once-in-a-century project . 
While experts have rated the engineering difficulty of this project as moderate , the more daunting challenge lies in logistics - management of cash , materials , and labor - all of which depend upon the ready availability of credit . 
Successful completion of the canal expansion is vital to [LOC U.S.  ] interests . 
Currently , roughly two thirds of all vessels transiting the canal are travelling to/from a [LOC U.S.  ] port , and 5 per cent of world commerce passes through the canal. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 .
