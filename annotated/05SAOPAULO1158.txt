[ORG REASON: E.O.  ] 12958 , 1.4 ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: While transiting through [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , [LOC Brasilia  ] TDY poloff attended an October 9 lunch with friends at which Federal Deputy and former [PER Lula Chief  ] of Staff [PER Jose Dirceu  ] was present . 
During their 30-minute conversation , [PER Dirceu  ] shared his views on the political crisis , the future of the Workers , Party ( [ORG PT  ] ) , prospects for political reform , and his own current status and plans for the future . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Dirceu  ] appeared well and reasonably relaxed . 
During the course of the meal , he talked mostly about his own family , cuisine , travel and personal things he wanted to do in the future . 
It was striking that , on the day of the decisive second round of the [ORG PT  ] internal elections , he had fully four hours to devote to this kind of activity . 
His cell phone only rang three or four times . 
Several of these calls appeared related to efforts by the opposition to accuse his son of committing irregularities , which obviously irritated him . 
Following the meal , TDY poloff had the opportunity to chat one-on-one with [PER Dirceu  ] for about thirty minutes. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Compared to previous conversations -- just after his resignation from the [LOC Planalto  ] in June and again in late August ( ref A ) -- [PER Dirceu  ] was less critical of the government and more optimistic about [PER Lula  ] , s prospects for re-election next year . 
As opposed to flatly predicting the President would lose , he now thinks there will be a competitive race , the result of which is currently unforeseeable . 
With respect to the [ORG PT  ] election for national president , he predicted ( accurately ) that [PER Ricardo Berzoini  ] would win narrowly , with about 52 percent of the vote . 
He did not anticipate that the new , more left-leaning composition of the national directorate would cause much of a problem within the party or for the government . 
In response to a question about the possible " re-radicalization8 of the [MISC Brazilian  ] left over the mid- and longer-term , [PER Dirceu  ] had the following observations: The [ORG PT  ] ) more or less as it is today ) would continue to dominate the left side of the [MISC Brazilian  ] political system . 
A few more defections might well take place , which he indicated he would even be pleased to see , but no single mass-based party would emerge to the [ORG PT  ] , s left . 
And no one within its loyal ranks would take it back to the old ( far left-wing ) posture during the post-Lula period . 
In an interesting aside , [PER Dirceu  ] averred that ) all modesty aside ) he was the only one who could carry off such a volte-face , but he had no intention of doing so because &of the kind of person he is and the fact it would be bad for the country. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) As on previous occasions , [PER Dirceu  ] did not appear very interested in the issue of political reform , or in the details or specifics of any such reform . 
He acknowledged that candidates , including [PER Lula  ] , would have to use reform as a campaign theme . 
In this context , [PER Dirceu  ] admitted that he himself had habitually spent twice what he had reported on his own campaigns and that all [MISC Brazilian  ] politicians employed some form of &caixa dois8 ( unaccounted or unreported funds ) . 
While bothered by the hypocrisy of his current adversaries on this score , [PER Dirceu  ] considered this practice natural and even unavoidable in a country where &politicians do not like to be seen taking money and donors do not like to be seen giving it. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) With respect to his own situation , [PER Dirceu  ] intends to continue vigorously defending himself against anything but acceptance of general political responsibility for the current problems of the [ORG PT  ] and the [PER Lula  ] administration . 
According to him , he is on good terms with the government but it is not helping him much ) and he neither wants nor needs any favors from the President , s office . 
Nevertheless , [PER Dirceu  ] still expects to be expelled from [ORG Congress  ] and deprived of the right to run again for eight years , and he seemed on this occasion somewhat less sure than previously that this result could be paralyzed or reversed in the courts . 
But he regards any such judgment as a purely political one . 
By his lights , in contrast to most of the other accused [MISC Congressmen  ] , there are no concrete proofs of wrongdoing on his part , and the congressional ethics committee lacks jurisdiction in his case , since he was not acting as a federal deputy when any of the acts he is accused of were committed . 
He would , however , have to accept whatever eventually happens . 
His strategy now is to keep his head down and work to maintain the enduring influence he still retains within the party. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In this regard , [PER Dirceu  ] strongly reiterated his interest in coming to the [LOC United States  ] during the December-February period for the purpose of decompressing , working on a book and learning [MISC English  ] . 
For the first time , he began making concrete inquiries about such practical matters as , for example , a visa , where he should stay in the [LOC U.S.  ] , and what he should do there . 
Poloff was non-committal but promised to talk with him again in [LOC Brasilia.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) This message was coordinated with [ORG Embassy Brasilia  ] .
