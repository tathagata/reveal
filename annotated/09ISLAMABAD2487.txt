12958: [LOC DECL:  ] 10/12/2019 TAGS: <a href='/tag/PREL_0.html'>PREL</a> <a href='/tag/PTER_0.html'>PTER</a> <a href='/tag/PGOV_0.html'>PGOV</a> <a href='/tag/PK_0.html'>PK</a> SUBJECT: STATUS OF [PER DANIEL PEARL  ] MURDER CASE AND [PER OMAR SAEED SHEIKH  ] Classified By: [PER Anne W. Patterson  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) On August 13 , the [ORG Sindh High Court  ] yet again continued the adjournment in the appellate case of [PER Omar Saeed Sheikh  ] , the convicted murderer of [LOC U.S.  ] journalist [PER Daniel Pearl  ] . 
According to [MISC Pakistani  ] legal experts , the refusal of the Court to hear the appeal or set a date for further hearings places Sheikh’s case in “sine-die adjournment” status , which means that his appeal proceedings are adjourned for an indefinite period of time . 
[PER Sheikh  ] was found guilty of murdering [PER Pearl  ] by a [ORG Karachi Court  ] in 2002 and was sentenced to death . 
Before the indefinite adjournment , Sheikh’s attorneys were attempting to appeal the verdict and sentence to the [ORG Sindh High Court  ] . 
The prosecutor had filed a separate appeal with the [ORG High Court  ] requesting tougher sentences for all individuals convicted of providing assistance to [PER Omar Saeed Sheikh  ] in the murder. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In Sheikh’s now dormant appeal , his lawyers had challenged the veracity of the testimony of some of the witnesses in the initial trial . 
As a result , the [ORG High Court  ] ordered the lower court to re-hear witnesses’ statements . 
In fact , most of the witnesses whose testimony is in question are not available to provide statements in future proceedings . 
Many have moved outside of [LOC Pakistan  ] because they fear for their safety and security , since it is widely believed that supporters of [PER Sheikh  ] would threaten , harm , or kill the witnesses in order to prevent them from testifying . 
The unavailability of witnesses makes this aspect of the appeal almost impossible to pursue. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In any event , neither Sheikh’s attorneys nor the [MISC Pakistani  ] government has pursued the lower court re-hearing because both sides understand this could open up a can of worms , with the lower court delving into other aspects of the case , including the sentencing . 
The potential downside for [PER Sheikh  ] is that , in this event , the lower court could order swift implementation of the death penalty . 
Post’s understanding , from speaking with [MISC Pakistani  ] legal experts , is that the prosecutor and Sheikh’s attorneys are thus passively allowing the current verdict and sentence to stand . 
Additionally , our legal contacts agree that , since [PER Sheikh  ] has received the death sentence , the chance of any successful appeal to the [ORG Sindh High Court  ] is minimal. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Sheikh  ] was transferred from a prison in [LOC Hyderabad  ] , [ORG Sindh  ] to a high-security prison in [LOC Karachi  ] in August 2009 . 
Embassy legal contacts advised that this transfer was part of regular prison procedure and not due to immediate security concerns or for pre-staging [PER Sheikh  ] for his release . 
It is [MISC Pakistani  ] government policy to shift prisoners between prisons every two to three years for routine security and administrative reasons . 
Additionally , prisoners can request to be transferred to a different prison located closer to their relatives to facilitate family visitation. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Comment: Though Sheikh’s appeals still formally exists in the [ORG Sindh High Court  ] , [MISC Pakistani  ] legal observers agree that his case is indefinitely adjourned . 
In the [MISC Pakistani  ] context , this means that all the suspects can be kept incarcerated without any foreseeable end . 
With Sheikh’s murder conviction and death sentence , there is , in fact , no legal or political will to release him or reverse his sentence . 
Sheikh’s prison transfer does not , in Post’s opinion , indicate a move to release him . 
Post will follow up on this matter in political channels to ensure that Sheikh’s conviction and sentence stay in force . 
End Comment .
