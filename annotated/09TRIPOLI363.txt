REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: [ORG Sudan Liberation Army Unity Faction  ] ( [ORG SLA/U  ] ) representatives back from [LOC Doha  ] are keen to know how the [ORG USG  ] regards rival factions - particularly [PER Khalil Ibrahim  ] 's [ORG Justice  ] and [ORG Equality Movement  ] ( [ORG JEM  ] ) - as they re-evaluate their strategy after a month of setbacks . 
With the March 15 " [ORG Charter  ] of [LOC Tripoli  ] " unification process quickly disbanded due to defections to the [ORG JEM  ] , rebel leaders are casting [PER Suliman Jamous'  ] switch as a positive - claiming that " [PER Khalil  ] 's best spy " was now exposed and [PER Abdullah Yehia  ] once again had the undisputed leadership of [ORG SLA/U  ] . 
Unity representatives said they are willing to talk peace , but cautioned that if [ORG JEM  ] continued attacking [PER Yehia  ] 's positions as they did on April 27 , [ORG SLA/U  ] would be forced to counterattack [ORG JEM  ] 's positions in [LOC Um Jalis  ] , [LOC Chad  ] . 
The rebel leaders are eager to discern the diplomatic states of play - both in the [MISC Libya/Chad/Sudan  ] tri-lateral talks and the [LOC U.S.  ] role in [MISC Doha-based  ] mediation - before committing to the peace process . 
End summary . 
CHAD'S SUPPORT FOR [ORG JEM  ] AND RECENT DEFECTIONS CAUSE ANXIETY 2 . 
( C ) In a May 3 meeting with [ORG Poloff  ] , [ORG SLA/U  ] representatives [PER Sayyid Sharif  ] and [PER Mahgoub Hussein  ] said they could accept further negotiations toward a cease fire in [LOC Doha  ] only with assurances that all parties brought to the table would be held to the same standard . 
[PER Sharif  ] and [PER Hussein  ] were particularly concerned that they were being boxed in " from every direction " - citing [LOC Sudan  ] 's support of the Janjaweed militias and calling [ORG JEM  ] 's [PER Khalil Ibrahim  ] " the [MISC Chadian  ] Minister of Defense . 
" Both representatives agreed that the April 27-29 meetings in [LOC Doha  ] were positive steps , but that attacks carried out against [ORG SLA/U  ] positions by [MISC JEM-affiliated  ] fighters on April 27 complicated an inclusive ceasefire between the [ORG SLA  ] and both the [ORG GOS  ] and other rebel factions . 
3 . 
( C ) [PER Hussein  ] confirmed [ORG JEM  ] 's April 3 announcement that former [ORG SLA High Command  ] member [PER Suliman Jamous  ] had joined up with [PER Khalil Ibrahim  ] but claimed [PER Jamous  ] took with him only 15-20 " family members " and four trucks . 
[ORG SLA/U  ] representatives here have frequently complained about [PER Jamous'  ] attempts to cloud the leadership issue , asserting that [PER Abdullah Yehia  ] had a mandate from civil society . 
[PER Hussein  ] noted that [PER Jamous  ] and [PER Ibrahim  ] have a long-standing relationship . 
He claimed that [PER Jamous  ] had been accepting cash from [PER Ibrahim  ] since the former 's release from prison and that his leaving [ORG JEM  ] would benefit [ORG SLA/U  ] in the long run as [ORG JEM  ] had lost " [PER Khalil  ] 's best spy " . 
Despite earlier comments that the March 15 " [ORG Charter  ] of [LOC Tripoli  ] " had made them significantly stronger ( ref A ) , [PER Hussein  ] discounted the defections of [PER Jamous  ] and the [ORG SLA/Juba  ] faction as minor and " personal " - noting that while high-profile members had switched their fighters had stayed with [PER Yehia.  ] . 
[ORG JEM  ] IS TRYING TO DESTROY [PER YEHIA  ] TO BECOME NEW RULER OF [LOC SUDAN  ] 4 . 
( C ) The [ORG SLA/U  ] officials also confirmed that [ORG JEM  ] had attacked [ORG SLA/U  ] positions an [ORG Um Rai  ] ( ref B ) with " 53 trucks and several hundred fighters , " which were repelled by an [ORG SLA/U  ] force consisting of just six trucks . 
[PER Abdallah Yehia  ] was at [ORG Um Rai  ] and participated in the five-hour battle , in which nine [ORG SLA/U  ] fighters were wounded and [ORG JEM  ] lost six killed in action . 
While [ORG SLA/U  ] still sees political solutions and peace talks in [LOC Doha  ] as possibly productive , both warned that if [ORG JEM  ] attacked [ORG SLA/U  ] again , they would have no option but to attack his base camp at [LOC Um Jalis  ] , [LOC Chad  ] . 
[PER Hussein  ] encouraged the [ORG USG  ] to rebuke [ORG JEM  ] for its continued fighting and for [PER Ibrahim  ] 's attempts to become the " new [PER Turabi  ] of [LOC Sudan  ] " . 
[ORG SLA/U  ] CLAIMS TO BE ONLY GROUP WITHOUT SPONSOR 5 . 
( C ) Holding out [MISC Chadian  ] support for [ORG JEM  ] and [MISC Sudanese  ] support for janjaweed militias , [PER Sharif  ] claimed that [ORG SLA/U  ] was the only rebel faction not participating in the proxy war between [LOC Chad  ] and [LOC Sudan  ] . 
According to [PER Sharif  ] , [ORG JEM  ] receives , " guns , ammunition , petrol , everything " from its sponsors in [LOC N'Djamena  ] . 
When asked where [ORG SLA/U  ] got their supplies , he said their fighters capture enough of what they need as the spoils of battle . 
He was eager to hear if we knew the outcome of [LOC Libya  ] 's ongoing efforts to reconcile [LOC Chad  ] and [LOC Sudan  ] and stand up a peacekeeping force on the border . 
[PER Hussein  ] expected to meet with [MISC Libyan  ] Foreign Minister [PER Musa Kusa  ] on May 4 or 5 , and said that [ORG SLA/U  ] had not yet received an invitation for follow-on talks in [LOC Doha  ] planned for the same timeframe . 
[LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000363 002.2 OF 002 6 . 
( C ) [MISC Comment:  ] After a month of setbacks , both representatives sought explicit statements of [ORG USG  ] support - calling immediately after returning to [LOC Tripoli  ] on April 30 to set up the meeting . 
They seemed somewhat unconvinced of their own spin about the unimportance of [PER Jamous'  ] defection and the disintegration of the March 15 unity talks in [LOC Tripoli  ] - which they had previously told us was a substantial increase in their military strength . 
Their advice-seeking seems genuine ; it appears as though they are approaching talks in [LOC Doha  ] as a question of survival of their movement in the face of [ORG JEM  ] 's ascendancy and renewed attacks on their leadership . 
Encouraging them to burnish their democratic and diplomatic credentials and desire to develop Darfur to serve its people by participating in [LOC Doha  ] talks in good faith will succeed only if they feel that [LOC Chad  ] , [LOC Sudan  ] , and the [ORG JEM  ] will be held to the same standard . 
End comment .
