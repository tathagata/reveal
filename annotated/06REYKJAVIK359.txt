( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: [MISC Icelandic  ] press reaction to the Prime Minister 's September 26 announcement of the results of defense talks with the [LOC U.S  ] . 
( Reftel ) has been measured and largely favorable . 
Opposition party expressions of discontent center on two points: 1 ) the Government 's failure to make public the details of [LOC U.S.  ] plans for the defense of [LOC Iceland  ] ; and 2 ) complaints that the [ORG USG  ] has " escaped " from full responsibility for any environmental mitigation costs . 
Post will continue to work with the media to fill in gaps in their knowledge and correct erroneous reports . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Media reporting on September 27 , the day after Prime Minister [PER Geir Haarde  ] 's announcement of the outcome of defense talks with the [LOC U.S  ] . 
( reftel ) was largely straightforward and accurate . 
Daily newspaper-of-record [PER Morgunbladid  ] ( generally pro-government but viscerally critical of the [LOC U.S.  ] decision to withdraw forces ) ran its lead editorial under the headline , " [MISC A New Chapter  ] " : --After the [LOC U.S.  ] conveyed its unilateral decision in March about departure of military forces , [LOC Iceland  ] was put in a difficult negotiating position ; --Icelandic authorities have done well under the circumstances and have ensured the nation 's interests are protected ; --The most controversial issue is that the [LOC U.S.  ] doesn't have to pay for environmental clean-up ; --The deal provides that the [LOC U.S.  ] is responsible for defending [LOC Iceland  ] , according to the 1951 [ORG Defense Agreement  ] , even if means of providing that defense are not what [MISC Icelandic  ] authorities wanted ; and --The time has passed when [LOC Iceland  ] could have relied solely on others for defense. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) The lead editorial in the high-circulation [ORG Frettabladid  ] ( which generally leans toward the opposition and is often skeptical of [ORG USG  ] policy ) appeared under the headline , " Back on [MISC Highway One  ] " ( i.e. , back on track ) , and commented: -- [LOC Iceland  ] retains a clear defense policy that ensures security of the nation , in which the [LOC U.S.  ] plays the key role ; and --It would have been irresponsible for the [ORG GOI  ] to have abrogated the 1951 [ORG Defense Agreement  ] ( note: as some , including former PM [PER David Oddsson  ] , have suggested should have been done ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) The PM and key members of his [ORG Independence Party  ] continued their media efforts as well: -- [PER Haarde  ] appeared on multiple TV news shows to reiterate and amplify the message from his initial press conference that the agreements ensure [LOC Iceland  ] 's continued defense , represent the best available outcome for both sides , and point to the way ahead for [MISC Iceland-U.S.  ] security relations. --Minister of Justice [PER Bjorn Bjarnason  ] ( comment: an early critic of the [LOC U.S.  ] withdrawal ; end comment ) said he was pleased with the agreements and that people were " making too much of " environmental concerns regarding the base . 
[PER Bjarnason  ] ( comment: one of [LOC Iceland  ] 's most security-conscious leaders ; end comment ) also voiced enthusiasm for increased police and counterterrorism exchanges between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Iceland  ] . 
-- [PER Parliamentarian Bjarni Benediktsson  ] , a rising leader of the next generation of the [ORG Independence Party  ] , was trotted out on the talk show circuit to declare that the agreements secured the defense of [LOC Iceland  ] and set the stage for future cooperation. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Opposition figures also tried to get their views out , though they garnered less coverage: --Ingibjorg [PER Solrun Gisladottir  ] , chair of the leading opposition [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] simultaneously welcomed the fact that there will be no foreign military forces stationed in [LOC Iceland  ] during peacetime , and criticized the [ORG GOI  ] for " leaving the public ill at ease " about its safety by agreeing to a " secret " defense plan . 
She [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000359 002.2 OF 002 further opined that [LOC Iceland  ] should have gotten a better deal from the [LOC U.S.  ] on environmental issues rather than " letting them leave without cleaning up . 
" --Chairman of the ( idiosyncratic , largely fishing-oriented ) [ORG Liberal Party  ] [PER Gudjon Kristjansson  ] said the [ORG GOI  ] had done as well as it could , all things considered , but said he wished more had been done to explore closer cooperation with other [ORG NATO  ] allies , particularly the [MISC Nordic  ] states. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Comment:  ] The [ORG GOI  ] should be - and , our contacts affirm , is - pleased with the tenor thus far of media coverage of the defense rollout . 
[PER Gisladottir  ] 's failure to mount a persuasive counterattack reflects the discord within the [ORG Alliance  ] , which - formed in 2000 from three disparate parties - has never established a formal policy on defense . 
Post will continue to work with the media to correct errors and fill in knowledge gaps , e.g. by offering data on the history of environmental mitigation at [LOC NASKEF  ] , and - to counter anxiety over the absence of [LOC U.S.  ] forces on the island - unclassified briefings on the expeditionary doctrine and rapid response capabilities of today 's [LOC U.S.  ] military .
