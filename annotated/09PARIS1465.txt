( C ) SUMMARY: [MISC French  ] officials generally agreed with [LOC U.S.  ] Ambassador to [LOC Guinea  ] [PER Patricia Moller  ] on the need for the international community to develop a visible process or framework on [LOC Guinea  ] that could lead to a transition to a democratic government , with [LOC Burkina Faso  ] President [PER Campaore  ] 's intervention a possible vehicle for forming such a process . 
[ORG Presidential Africa Advisor  ] [PER Andre Parant  ] plans to travel to [LOC Ouagadougou  ] for meetings with [PER Campaore  ] on November 2 , where [PER Parant  ] will offer [LOC France  ] 's support . 
While agreeing that junta leader [PER Dadis Camara  ] had to be removed from power , they believed that [PER Dadis  ] could be part of the solution to the problem if handled properly through the right combination of " carrots and sticks . 
" The [MISC French  ] were encouraged by the [ORG African Union  ] 's October 29 decision to take a firm stance on [LOC Guinea  ] , and they believed that the [ORG AU  ] , following [ORG ECOWAS  ] 's lead , could play a useful role in resolving the crisis in [LOC Guinea  ] . 
Once the transition process gains traction , [LOC France  ] is prepared to commit resources and expertise , especially for reforming [LOC Guinea  ] 's military . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [LOC U.S.  ] Ambassador to [LOC Guinea  ] [PER Patricia Moller  ] , met , separately , with [ORG MFA AF  ] A/S-equivalent [PER Stephane Gompertz  ] and [ORG Presidential Africa Advisor  ] [PER Remi Marechaux  ] on October 30 , following her meeting on October 29 with [ORG MOD Africa Analyst  ] [PER Jerome Spinoza  ] . 
AF-watcher attended the meeting with [PER Marechaux  ] ; AF-assistant attended the meetings with [PER Gompertz  ] and [PER Spinoza  ] . 
[ORG MFA Guinea  ] desk officer [PER Ann'laure Hare  ] attended the meeting with [PER Gompertz  ] . 
Meeting with [PER Gompertz  ] ( [ORG MFA  ] ) --------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Gompertz  ] began by asking what Ambassador [PER Moller  ] planned to do concerning her credentials . 
She replied that she would not present her credentials to the [PER Dadis  ] government and , if pressed , would say that she would do so only when a democratically-elected government was in place in [LOC Conakry  ] . 
[PER Gompertz  ] explained that [LOC France  ] 's recently arrived Ambassador ( [PER Jean Graebling  ] ) had similarly refused to present his credentials . 
The CNDD Foreign Minister informed [PER Graebling  ] that , as a result , Graelbing would have no access to regime officials . 
[PER Gompertz  ] observed that Ambassadors [PER Graebling  ] and [PER Moller  ] would be in similar situations . 
He and Ambassador [PER Moller  ] looked forward to close working relations between the Ambassadors [PER Graebling  ] and [PER Moller  ] in [LOC Conakry.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Gompertz  ] noted the [ORG AU  ] 's October 29 communique on [LOC Guinea  ] , which he deemed very helpful . 
He commented on [ORG EU  ] efforts to develop travel bans and asset freezes . 
Ambassador [PER Moller  ] said the [ORG USG  ] was taking similar steps. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) On the broader issue of next steps , Ambassador [PER Moller  ] stressed ultimate priority of avoiding a melt-down in [LOC Guinea  ] , with which [PER Gompertz  ] agreed . 
To accomplish that , Ambassador [PER Moller  ] said that it was imperative for the international community to establish a process or framework -- the more visible the better -- to show that there was a serious commitment on moving [LOC Guinea  ] away from the abyss and towards an acceptable democratic transition , which could be centered on [MISC African  ] institutions such as the [ORG AU  ] or [ORG ECOWAS  ] , with the support and participation of other members of the international community. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Gompertz  ] agreed , and he said that [LOC Burkina Faso  ] President [PER Campaore  ] , who had already taken up a mediator 's role , could be the focus of such an effort . 
[PER Gompertz  ] said that [ORG Presidential AF-advisor Andre Parant  ] was going to [LOC Burkina Faso  ] and would meet with [PER Campaore  ] on November 2 , to discuss [LOC Guinea  ] as a first priority , and also [LOC Niger  ] . 
[PER Gompertz  ] indicated that [PER Parant  ] would try to encourage movement on [PER Campaore  ] 's part , although [PER Gompertz  ] noted [PER Campaore  ] 's preference to move deliberately . 
He also mentioned that [PER Campaore  ] had personal economic interests in [LOC Guinea  ] ( as he had in many other [MISC African  ] countries ) that would be a factor in his decision-making . 
[PER Gompertz  ] encouraged the [LOC U.S.  ] to talk to [ORG Campaore.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Gompertz  ] , while harboring no illusions about [PER Dadis  ] ( describing his as " dangerous " and " insane " ) nonetheless believed that [PER Dadis  ] should be part of the solution and not simply isolated and scorned . 
He needed to be offered an exit or a way out . 
[PER Gompertz  ] mused on the possibility that [LOC Morocco  ] ( where the junta has cached much of its wealth ) or [LOC Libya  ] could serve as points of exile , although Ambassador [PER Moller  ] indicated that [LOC Morocco  ] had signaled that it was not interested in hosting an exiled [PER Dadis  ] . 
[PER Gompertz  ] said that other factors to be considered were the danger of civil war ( the [MISC Forestiers  ] had to be reassured that [PER Dadis  ] 's departure did not signal a return to [PER Peul  ] or Malinke dominance over the [MISC Forestiers  ] ) and the need to accommodate [LOC Guinea  ] 's military . 
[PER Gompertz  ] observed that a transition to a democratic government was essential , in order to avoid a " melt down " or else a drift into a [LOC Zimbabwe-like  ] state , which would be hardly any better. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Asked about the departure of [MISC French  ] citizens from [LOC Guinea  ] , [PER Gompertz  ] said that about 500 of 1,800 had left following the [ORG GOF  ] 's public suggestion that citizens leave voluntarily rather than wait for a possible evacuation under emergency conditions . 
He noted that of the remainder , many were dual nationals or long-term residents not inclined to leave in any case . 
[PER Gompertz  ] said that the suggestion to leave was more anticipatory in nature and to prepare for the worst , not an indication that conditions were at an extreme . 
( [PER Marechaux  ] claimed that about 800 [MISC French  ] , out of 2,300 , had departed , and that there were an estimated 600 known dual nationals who would likely never leave . 
He also verified that the [MISC GOF-supported  ] school in [LOC Conakry  ] would remain closed until an acceptable transition government was in place . 
) Meeting with [PER Marechaux  ] ( Presidency ) ----------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [ORG Presidential Africa Advisor  ] , [PER Remi Marechaux  ] , who will travel with [PER Parant  ] to [LOC Ouagadougou  ] , echoed many of the points made by [PER Gompertz  ] . 
In particular , he noted that it was important to support [PER Campaore  ] and allow him to lead , even though there would be frustrations that [PER Campaore  ] wanted to " maintain leeway " and that the mediation would happen " on [MISC African  ] time . 
" Part of the problem was that [PER Campaore  ] relies on only 5-6 advisors to assist with all his mediations , including for [LOC Togo  ] and [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] , and that even FM Yoda could not speak authoritatively on [PER Campaore  ] 's thinking. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) In [PER Marechaux  ] 's opinion , [PER Campaore  ] was " scared by the strength of the international community 's strength of reaction " to the September 28 violence . 
Therefore , [PER Marechaux  ] said that in [LOC Ouagadougou  ] , [PER Parant  ] would make clear that [LOC France  ] would support [PER Campaore  ] , if requested , on delivering demarches , providing ideas on the way forward , and even helping with travel or other logistic requirements . 
[PER Marechaux  ] agreed with Ambassador [PER Moller  ] that it is important to get some visibility on a specific transition plan soon , but described the situation as still in the " threat stage , " and that " we still have 2-3 weeks before we need to be greatly concerned about a lack of progress . 
" <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Marechaux  ] described the sanctions and [ORG UN Commission of Inquiry  ] as " tools " that should not be confused with the international community 's " goals . 
" In creating the sanctions list , there was a vibrant debate within the [ORG GOF  ] , with some wanting the sanctions to be more targeted to " destabilize " the junta . 
Now that the list is , in the end , quite inclusive , it needs to remain dynamic so that those listed understanding there is the option of being removed from the list if they depart the junta and help the transition process -- a process that leads to the removal of [LOC Dadis.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Parant will also discuss with [PER Campaore  ] the question of what to do with [PER Dadis  ] , reminding [PER Campaore  ] that he needs to reach out to countries who might accept the junta leader should he step down . 
[LOC France  ] also wants [PER Campaore  ] to consider how to avoid the possibility of an [ORG International Criminal Court  ] ( [ORG ICC  ] ) case against [PER Dadis  ] , which , [PER Marechaux  ] added , would be a disincentive for the junta to agree to give up power . 
Marachaux speculated that perhaps some kind of in-country court could be established which , in the end , would allow [PER Dadis  ] and others a way to be relocated. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Another critical step raised by [PER Marechaux  ] is to plan for some kind of international observer force , noting the effectiveness of 50 or so [ORG ECOWAS  ] troops who helped during [LOC Togo  ] 's 2007 elections by assuring that military forces stayed in their barracks and by conducting joint patrols with [LOC Togo  ] 's police and gendarmes . 
In [PER Marechaux  ] 's opinion , it would be difficult for [MISC Guinean  ] authorities to refuse a similar [ORG ECOWAS  ] plan . 
However , a large intervention force was not realistic. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Marechaux  ] stated that reforming the military needed to be included in the transition plan , and that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC France  ] needed to work together on this . 
He asserted that the majority of [LOC Guinea  ] 's military was not implicated in the September 28 attacks , and that [LOC Guinea  ] 's gendarme force had performed well . 
[PER Dadis  ] may have recruited up to 2,500 fighters from [LOC Liberia  ] , but the [MISC Guinean  ] forces loyal to the junta numbered only about 2,000 . 
This left a significant military to work with . 
[PER Marechaux  ] raised the idea of possibly training [MISC Guinean  ] troops for [ORG UN  ] peacekeeping duty , effectively reducing the influence of the military in [LOC Guinea  ] . 
Ambassador [PER Moller  ] remarked that peacekeeping training and deployment had been a successful strategy in [LOC Burundi  ] . 
Meeting with [PER Spinoza  ] ( [ORG MOD  ] ) -------------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER Jerome Spinoza  ] at the [ORG MOD  ] 's [ORG Strategic Affairs Delegation  ] , befitting his position as an analyst , offered a broader , less operational view of [LOC Guinea  ] during his October 29 meeting with Ambassador [PER Moller  ] . 
Of the three interlocutors , he was the one who most directly counseled against demonizing and isolating [PER Dadis  ] . 
He too shared no illusions about [PER Dadis  ] but he thought that [PER Dadis  ] was more reasonable and susceptible to persuasion than others might think , even if only at the level of self-interest . 
He believed that [PER Dadis  ] should be part of any process to end the junta 's control of [LOC Guinea  ] and to move to a more acceptable government . 
[PER Spinoza  ] agreed with Ambassador [PER Moller  ] 's views on the need to establish a process for channeling [LOC Guinea  ] in the right direction and the need to avoid a complete collapse in [LOC Guinea  ] , which would be bad for [LOC Guinea  ] and disastrous for the region , which was grappling with recoveries in in [LOC Sierra Leone  ] , [LOC Liberia  ] , and [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] . 
[PER Spinoza  ] acknowledged that some of his colleagues considered him " pro-junta , " but he said that this was only because he believed one had to work with the junta rather than isolate it or back it into a corner where its only choice might be aggression . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) The [MISC French  ] clearly welcomed the opportunity to consult with Ambassador [PER Moller  ] and we expect she will a close and collaborative relationship with the [MISC French  ] in [LOC Conakry  ] . 
More importantly , in each of her discussions , [MISC French  ] agreement on the need for a visible international process strengthened , with a focus on [PER Campaore  ] 's initiative . 
END COMMENT. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( U ) Ambassador [PER Moller  ] has cleared this message. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( U ) [LOC Conakry  ] minimize considered .
