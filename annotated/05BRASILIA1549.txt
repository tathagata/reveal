REASONS: 1.4 ( B ) ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Introduction: Ambassador and PolCounselor met on 8 June at the residence for a private lunch with President [PER Lula da Silva  ] 's [ORG Foreign Affairs Advisor  ] , [PER Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] and his deputy , [PER Marcel Biato  ] . 
[PER Garcia  ] has traveled repeatedly as [PER Lula  ] 's " fireman " to [LOC Venezuela  ] ( he speaks by phone and meets frequently with [PER Hugo Chavez  ] ) , [LOC Haiti  ] ( where he spent a week in October 2004 assessing security , political and assistance issues ) and [LOC Bolivia  ] ( where he was dispatched by [PER Lula  ] last week for meetings with President [LOC Mesa  ] , [ORG MAS  ] leader [PER Evo Morales  ] , church and social sector representatives and [ORG U.S. Embassy Charge  ] . 
) Septel will focus on the discussion regarding [LOC Haiti  ] ; details of the [LOC Bolivia  ] discussion follow below . 
2 . 
( C ) [PER Garcia  ] returned from [LOC Bolivia  ] at the end of last week and has been monitoring the situation closely since then . 
He expects major developments in the next 24-48 hours . 
[PER Garcia  ] said that both he and [PER FM Amorim  ] ( who returned early from the [ORG OAS  ] GA because of [LOC Bolivia  ] ) are on stand-by for travel to [LOC Bolivia  ] on short notice , but [PER Garcia  ] opined that he thought it would be best if he goes instead of [PER Amorim  ] ( Comment: [PER Garcia  ] 's reasoning was not explained , but we assumed he thought [PER Amorim  ] 's presence would raise the signature of [MISC Brazilian  ] involvement higher than the [ORG GOB  ] believes to be opportune . 
[PER Amorim  ] called [PER Garcia  ] on his cell phone during the meeting with Ambassador and the two conferred on [LOC Bolivia  ] developments . 
End comment . 
) [PER Garcia  ] made these observations on the current situation: -- The [ORG GOB  ] believes the best succession scenario in the current conditions would be by-passing [ORG Senate  ] President [PER Vaca Diez  ] and [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] President [PER Mario Cossio  ] , who are deeply unpopular with protesting sectors , and passing executive authority after their resignations to the chief [ORG Supreme Court  ] justice until new elections are held . 
This is constitutional and provides " breathing room " in which [PER Morales  ] and others may be persuaded to demobilize protests in the immediate term . 
-- A worst case scenario , in [PER Garcia  ] 's view and based on his meetings last week , would be assumption of authority by [PER Vaca Diez  ] . 
[PER Garcia  ] said the [ORG GOB  ] fears a large-scale , violent revolt in such a case , with protestors occupying areas around government buildings in an effort to bar [PER Diez  ] 's installation as acting president . 
The potential for a blood bath is such circumstances deeply concerns the [MISC Brazilians  ] , [PER Garcia  ] said . 
-- Another scenario for defusing tensions would be a decision to nationalize the gas sector immediately by whomever is acting as president , [PER Garcia  ] said . 
He noted that such a decision would involve complex arbitration in its aftermath and would be " reversable at most any time , " hence there could be some merit in using this tactic to provide immediate stabilization in the country . 
( Comment: [PER Garcia  ] must understand this would be an extreme option , but he appeared to believe the circumstances are sufficiently grave that unorthodox tactics are required . 
End comment . 
) -- Asked about the possibility of a victory by [PER Morales  ] if elections are called , [PER Garcia  ] replied that the [ORG GOB  ] doubts [PER Morales  ] could win , and [PER Morales  ] must be aware of this reality . 
[PER Garcia  ] opined that [PER Morales  ] has " radicalized " in some positions , but that he also must be aware that such extreme positions do not constitute " an agenda for governance . 
" [PER Garcia  ] also seemed to downplay the influence of [PER Chavez  ] on [PER Morales  ] , but would not be drawn into a detailed discussion , joking only that " [LOC Venezuela  ] and the [LOC United States  ] are equally distrusted , " depending on who one talks to in [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
-- [PER Garcia  ] praised the role of the church and senior clergy who are politically astute , saying the church now is virtually the only institution in [LOC Bolivia  ] with sufficient credibility and good will across the social spectrum to act as a mediator . 
-- In terms of mediation , [PER Garcia  ] said that the [ORG GOB  ] has not offered itself in any specific role to the [MISC Bolivians  ] , but has made clear it would be willing to engage if requested , possibly working with the [MISC Argentines  ] . 
[PER Garcia  ] said that [ORG OAS  ] mediation is not likely to be accepted in [LOC Bolivia  ] owing to the [MISC Chilean  ] nationality of the Secretary General . 
-- [PER Garcia  ] said the [ORG GOB  ] and [MISC Brazilian  ] military are quietly completing contingency planning for evacuation of [MISC Brazilian  ] citizens ( mainly from [LOC La Paz  ] ) in the event of a major collapse. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Comment: It is possible [PER Garcia  ] will be on a plane to [LOC Bolivia  ] on/around the time this message reaches [LOC Washington  ] . 
The [ORG GOB  ] clearly is seized with the unfolding crisis , and [PER Garcia  ] candidly stated to Ambassador that what is happening in [LOC Bolivia  ] is a potentially devastating repudiation of [LOC Brazil  ] 's efforts to present regional economic integration as a basis for enhancing political stability in [LOC South America  ] . 
The efficacy of [MISC Brazilian  ] efforts to assist in the crisis in the immediate term remain to be seen , but we believe we should remain engaged with the [ORG GOB  ] on its willingness to work with [LOC Argentina  ] in some capacity as mediators/guarantors if the different sectors in [LOC Bolivia  ] reach a consensus on seeking outside support for a solution to the crisis.</pre></code>
