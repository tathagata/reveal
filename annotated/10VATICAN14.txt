Foley  ] , Pol Chief . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) The [LOC Vatican  ] 's point person on [LOC Cuba  ] , Monsignor [PER Accattino  ] , supports [ORG EU  ] dialogue with [LOC Cuba  ] and said the [LOC U.S.  ] should refrain from unilateral actions against [LOC Cuba  ] that play into the hands of the Castros - or [PER Hugo Chavez  ] . 
This is particularly true , he said , of decisions like identifying [MISC Cubans  ] as nationals of particular concern in air travel . 
The [LOC Vatican  ] is concerned that the disastrous economic situation on the island and political tension could lead to bloodshed . 
[PER Accattino  ] added the " new [PER Fidel Castro  ] " in the [LOC Western Hemisphere  ] is [PER Chavez  ] . 
In a separate meeting , another [LOC Vatican  ] official recommended that the [LOC U.S.  ] do everything within its power to ensure low rates for [MISC Cubans  ] phoning the [LOC U.S.  ] End summary . 
[ORG EU  ] Should Engage [LOC Cuba  ] --------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG DCM  ] and polchief met with [PER Accattino  ] on January 14 to discuss [ORG USG  ] views on [ORG EU  ] dialogue with [LOC Cuba  ] ( ref . 
A ) . 
[PER Accattino  ] was ambivalent about the pros and cons of a common [ORG EU  ] position on [LOC Cuba  ] . 
He said it was important to coordinate approaches , but implied a preference for the soft approach of [LOC Spain  ] over that of [LOC Poland  ] or the [LOC Czech Republic  ] as being more conducive to a positive response from the [MISC Cubans  ] . 
Nevertheless , he conceded that human rights should be part of the agenda in [ORG EU  ] dialogue with [LOC Cuba  ] and in specific [MISC European  ] capitals' individual dialogues with [LOC Havana  ] . 
However , he thought that the island 's blatantly poor human rights record should not block engagement with [LOC Cuba  ] any more than it does with other rights-abusing nations . 
After all , he said , the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [ORG EU  ] engage other countries that violate human rights , like [LOC China  ] . 
[LOC U.S.  ] Should Not Be a Hostage to [LOC Cuba  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Accattino  ] thought [LOC U.S.  ] domestic politics had a counterproductive impact on [LOC USG-Cuba  ] policy . 
As an example , he pointed to the recent [ORG USG  ] decision to expand screening of [MISC Cubans  ] entering the [LOC U.S.  ] by air . 
Despite being a state sponsor of terrorism , [LOC Cuba  ] does not really pose a real threat to the [LOC U.S.  ] , he said , so the designation was purely for domestic political reasons . 
[PER Accattino  ] thought this was unjustified , and played into regime hard-liners' portrayal of the [LOC U.S.  ] as intrinsically hostile. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Looking ahead , [PER Accattino  ] said [LOC Cuba  ] 's economic and social situations are becoming so bad that people could react violently . 
If that happens , he added , some in and outside of [LOC Cuba  ] could blame the [LOC U.S.  ] for having contributed to the situation . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] should not allow itself to be held hostage by domestic politics to maintain the current " counterproductive policy . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Moreover , [PER Accattino  ] thought that [LOC U.S.  ] policies toward [LOC Cuba  ] help [PER Chavez  ] , " who is the true , new successor of [PER Fidel Castro  ] in [LOC Latin America  ] . 
" Unlike [PER Fidel  ] , he added , [PER Chavez  ] has oil revenues to support his [MISC Bolivarian  ] revolution . 
Keep Those Phone Rates Low -------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In a separate conversation with the Ambassador on the [LOC VATICAN  ] 00000014 002.2 OF 002 margins of a reception on January 15 , Monsignor [PER Nicolas Thevenin  ] , the political advisor to Secretary of State Cardinal [PER Bertone  ] , commended the [LOC U.S.  ] for allowing [LOC U.S.  ] telecommunication companies pursue business in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
[PER Thevenin  ] , who served as a [LOC Vatican  ] diplomat in [LOC Cuba  ] years ago , continues to follow developments on the island . 
He hoped the [ORG USG  ] could lean on telecommunications companies to make sure that rates for [MISC Cubans  ] to call the [LOC U.S.  ] would be very low . 
This , he thought , could have a positive impact in promoting political change . 
Comment ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Accattino  ] reiterated the [LOC Vatican  ] line about always engaging in dialogue , no matter how unpleasant the interlocutor . 
He also made it clear that the [LOC Vatican  ] is far more concerned about [PER Chavez  ] than [PER Raul Castro  ] , considering him more dangerous and with a longer reach ( not to mention younger ) . 
For this reason , the [LOC Vatican  ] has welcomed recent [ORG USG  ] gestures towards [LOC Cuba  ] warmly and advocates further [ORG USG  ] actions that , the [LOC Vatican  ] believes , would make it increasingly difficult for [LOC Caracas  ] or [LOC Havana  ] to blame [LOC Cuba  ] 's economic and social failures on [LOC Washington  ] . 
End comment .
