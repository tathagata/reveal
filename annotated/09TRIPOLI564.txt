Cretz  ] , Ambassador . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: In a July 1 meeting on the margins of the [ORG African Union Summit  ] in [LOC Sirte  ] , [LOC Libya  ] 's top [LOC Africa  ] diplomat [PER Ali Treiki  ] told Special Envoy [PER Scott Gration  ] that [LOC Libya  ] was taking steps to secure peace on the [MISC Chad-Sudan  ] border and effect a political solution between the two governments . 
[PER Treiki  ] complained that none of the actors involved were fully behind the peace process but argued that openings existed within the rebel movements and the Government of [LOC Chad  ] ( [ORG GOC  ] ) to encourage people to negotiate . 
SE [PER Gration  ] described his comprehensive approach to achieving peace and stability in [LOC Sudan  ] -- tackling [MISC North-South  ] , [LOC Darfur  ] , and [MISC Chad-Sudan  ] issues simultaneously as variables in the same system . 
He encouraged [LOC Libya  ] to use its leverage with the governments in [LOC Chad  ] and [LOC Sudan  ] to work for a ceasefire agreement and end President [PER Deby  ] 's support for the [ORG Justice  ] and [ORG Equality Movement  ] ( [ORG JEM  ] ) . 
[PER Treiki  ] said he would use his position as UNGA President to promote international cooperation to solve the problem of [LOC Darfur  ] . 
End Summary . 
RECENT REBEL LOSES CREATE OPENING FOR CEASE FIRE 2 . 
( C ) Special Envoy for [LOC Sudan  ] [PER Scott Gration  ] met with top [LOC Libya  ] diplomat just after the opening ceremony of the 13th [ORG African Union  ] ( [ORG AU  ] ) [ORG Summit  ] on July 1 . 
SE [PER Gration  ] provided a read out of his June 29 meeting with [MISC Chadian  ] President [PER Idriss Deby  ] ( ref [ORG NDJ  ] 264 ) and said progress must be made on humanitarian , security , and political fronts in advance of [MISC Sudanese  ] elections scheduled for April 2010 and the [MISC North-South  ] partition referendum slated for 2011 . 
[PER Treiki  ] agreed and reported that a 2,000-member peacekeeping force comprised of 1,000 troops from both [LOC Chad  ] and [LOC Sudan  ] was ready to deploy , under [MISC Libyan  ] command , to 10 points along the border . 
Noting that both sides are hesitant to sign and implement ceasefire agreements ongoing fighting along the border , [PER Treiki  ] viewed the [MISC Libyan-led  ] peacekeepers as an essential step to bring [PER Deby  ] to the negotiating table . 
3 . 
( C ) [PER Treiki  ] and [PER Gration  ] agreed that the [ORG Contact Group  ] should take the symbolic step of meeting in [LOC Khartoum  ] , with [PER Treiki  ] seeing a [MISC Sudan-based  ] meeting as an opportunity to renew direct contacts between the [MISC Chadian  ] and [MISC Sudanese  ] governments . 
SE [PER Gration  ] asked [PER Treiki  ] to help organize the meeting quickly as recent developments provided a possible opening to reach agreement: the [ORG GOC  ] 's recent military victories over [MISC Chadian  ] rebels had increased confidence in its military and reduced its reliance on the [ORG JEM  ] while the [ORG JEM  ] 's late-May attacks in [LOC Sudan  ] had weakened that group militarily . 
SE [PER Gration  ] said that increased pressure was needed on President [PER Bashir  ] to not only end his support for [MISC Chadian  ] -- including providing weapons and mines . 
[PER Treiki  ] reported that [LOC Sudan  ] had enlisted [MISC Ukrainian  ] and [MISC Algerian  ] mercenaries in the border war and that the desert area would remain sensitive for some time . 
4 . 
( C ) In [PER Treiki  ] 's view , [PER Deby  ] had lost control over [ORG JEM  ] leader [PER Khalil Ibrahim  ] . 
[PER Deby  ] 's near ouster at the hands of [MISC Chadian  ] rebels in February 2008 caused him to intensify support for [ORG JEM  ] 's Zaghawa leadership based on tribal affiliation . 
[PER Treiki  ] saw this tactic as short-sighted , commenting that " you cannot control a country with only 4% of the population with you " . 
SE [PER Gration  ] argued that [LOC Chad  ] would be unable to promote the development and security initiatives it needed if [PER Deby  ] continued spending large sums on his eastern frontier trying to defeat [PER Salah Gosht  ] . 
[PER Treiki  ] agreed , noting that " even [LOC China  ] or the [LOC U.S.  ] can't control the deserts if the [ governments in [LOC N'Djamena  ] and [LOC Khartoum  ] ] aren't ready " . 
[PER Treiki  ] promised to speak with [MISC Chadian  ] FM [PER Moussa Faki  ] during the [ORG AU Summit  ] to push him toward a negotiated peace settlement . 
5 . 
( C ) Turning to [MISC UN/AU Joint  ] Mediator [PER Djibril Bossole  ] , [PER Treiki  ] complained that the mediator had spent too much time talking without achieving any results . 
[PER Treiki  ] discounted the [LOC Doha  ] process as ineffectual , saying that Fur leaders considered the [LOC Qatar  ] government too close to [PER Bashir  ] and worried about travel to the [LOC Gulf  ] . 
He reiterated a need to restart the stalled [LOC Sirte  ] process of rebel-government peace talks , though the SE questioned whether rebel leaders like [PER Abdul Wahid  ] would travel to [LOC Libya  ] . 
[PER Treiki  ] was impressed that SE [PER Gration  ] had met with major rebel leaders like [PER Minni Minnowi  ] , [PER Khalil Ibrahim  ] , and [PER Abdul Wahid  ] and noted that each had significant flaws that would make dealing with them more difficult . 
[PER Minni  ] seemed undecided as to whether he would stay with the [LOC Khartoum  ] government or resume his rebellion . 
[PER Khalil  ] 's ambition to control all of [LOC Sudan  ] makes him less likely to negotiate while losing the ability to claim leadership over the Fur people . 
As for [PER Abdul Wahid  ] , [PER Treiki  ] agreed that he " lives in his own universe " in [LOC Paris  ] . 
[ORG SUDAN: UNITY  ] GOVERNMENT IN NAME ONLY 6 . 
( C ) [PER Treiki  ] assessed the relationship between [LOC Khartoum  ] ( [ORG GOS  ] ) and [PER Juba  ] ( [ORG GOSS  ] ) as better than [LOC Darfur  ] , but still quite TRIPOLI 00000564 002.2 OF 002 troublesome . 
The [ORG GOL  ] recently opened a consulate in [LOC Juba  ] and was closely monitoring relations between [LOC North  ] and [LOC South Sudan  ] . 
[PER Treiki  ] cautioned that a federal government made up of two clashing points of view ( i.e. the [ORG NCP  ] and [ORG SPLM  ] ) could not function and said that Government of [ORG National Unity  ] ( [ORG GNU  ] ) Foreign Minister [PER Deng Alor  ] needed to respect government decisions " wrong or right " . 
SE [PER Gration  ] agreed that the [ORG GNU  ] was dysfunctional but said that the international community needed to push the two parties to cooperate . 
Noting that the [ORG GOSS  ] was more interested in tanks than roads , SE [PER Gration  ] said that diversification of the [MISC GOSS'  ] oil-based economy would be essential to promoting unity between [LOC Khartoum  ] and [LOC Juba  ] . 
SE [PER Gration  ] envisioned a food-exporting , educated [LOC Sudan  ] that could serve as a net contributor to regional stability rather than a major source of violence . 
7 . 
( C ) [PER Treiki  ] offered to help as he could , using both his [MISC Libyan  ] platform and the bully pulpit of the UNGA Presidency . 
He said that [LOC Libya  ] stood ready to provide aid and expertise in development projects to [LOC Sudan  ] as it had in other [MISC African  ] nations like [LOC Malawi  ] . 
SE [PER Gration  ] pressed him to use his leverage over [PER Bashir  ] to encourage a [ORG Contact Group  ] meeting in [LOC Khartoum  ] before the end of July . 
He also asked that [PER Treiki  ] support efforts to increase MINURCAT 's troop level and expand its mandate . 
[PER Treiki  ] said he was available to help in [LOC Libya  ] through the end of July , after which he would travel to [LOC New York  ] to undertake his duties there .
