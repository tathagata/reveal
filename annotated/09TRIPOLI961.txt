Cretz  ] , Ambassador , [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy [LOC Tripoli  ] , [ORG Department of State  ] . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: A recent decision by [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi to unilaterally change the date of the [ORG Eid  ] al-Adha celebration from November 27 to November 26 -- one day before the full [MISC Islamic  ] pilgrimage rite had been completed in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] -- provoked confusion , resentment , and some outrage among the [MISC Libyan  ] community . 
In a rare display of defiance in this totalitarian system , at least 16 imams led [ORG Eid  ] prayers on November 27 , in line with the rest of the world . 
Some observers believe [PER Qadhafi  ] 's controversial decision resulted from his ongoing feud with [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] 's leadership . 
Others believe it was political theater , designed to allow [PER Saif  ] al-Islam to play the role of hero , coming to the rescue of the angry [MISC Libyan  ] masses . 
End Summary . 
QADHAFI'S INTERVENTION GOES TOO FAR 2 . 
( C ) While the [MISC Libyan  ] regime prides itself on promoting moderate forms of [MISC Islam  ] and serving as a counterbalance to fundamentalist movements , its unique interpretation of [MISC Islam  ] sometimes provokes controversy . 
The [MISC Islamic  ] year in [LOC Libya  ] , for example , is measured not from the [LOC Hijra  ] but rather from the death of the Prophet [PER Mohammed  ] . 
The [ORG GOL-run Center for Remote Sensing  ] , also charged with [LOC Libya  ] 's space program , is usually the first authority in the world to observe the lunar phases -- due to [LOC Libya  ] 's convenient position in the earth 's rotation -- that mark traditional [MISC Islamic  ] celebrations , creating situations where [LOC Libya  ] begins and ends the holy month of [MISC Ramadan  ] a full day earlier than other [MISC Muslim  ] countries . 
Some [MISC Libyans  ] privately attribute this practice to [LOC Libya  ] 's perpetual quest to stand out from the crowd , with xxxxxxxxxxxx opining that " if you're different , you'll be noticed . 
" Despite the calendar quirks , [LOC Libya  ] typically celebrates [MISC Youm  ] al-Arafat and [ORG Eid  ] al-Adha in line with the rest of the world due to the feast being driven by the events of the [ORG Hajj  ] . 
This year , however , the government announced after the [ORG Hajj  ] was underway that the [ORG Eid  ] would fall on November 26 -- a day earlier than in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
IMAMS PROSECUTED FOR DEFYING LEADER'S ORDER 3 . 
( C ) Several local contacts privately told us that they were shocked by the [MISC Libyan  ] Government 's " unprecedented " decision to celebrate the [ORG Eid  ] al-Adha before [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , confirming that the decision sparked an unprecedented degree of public grumbling about the regime . 
A xxxxxxxxxxxx estimated that only ten percent of the [MISC Libyan  ] population celebrated the [ORG Eid  ] on November 26 . 
Stressing that [MISC Libyans  ] were scandalized by the [ORG GOL  ] 's decision to mark [ORG Eid  ] al-Adha before the full pilgrimage rite had been completed in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , he said that mosques were largely empty on November 26 but were packed on November 27 . 
He said that [MISC Libyan  ] intelligence agents were out in full force in the mosques on November 27 , " photographing everyone who was there " and later questioning imams who marked the [ORG Eid  ] on November 27 . 
4 . 
( C ) [MISC Foreign-based  ] website [LOC Libya  ] al-Youm reported November 27 that the government had removed 16 imams from their posts and were investigating their preaching after they ignored the government 's [ORG Eid  ] decree . 
Allegedly in response to public pressure , Secretary of the General People 's Committee for [ORG Religious Endowments  ] and [ORG Zakat  ] , [PER Ibrahim Abdulsalam Ibrahim  ] , made a statement December 2 in the [LOC Tripoli  ] daily " [ORG Oea  ] " newspaper ( part of [PER Saif  ] al-Islam 's " [ORG Al Ghad  ] " media group ) denying that any action had been taken against the imams . 
[PER Ibrahim  ] emphasized that state-funded mosques are bound by the decisions of his ministry and reserved the right to question imams for non-adherence to official policies . 
One imam told our xxxxxxxxxxxx contact that [PER Saif  ] al-Islam later intervened to stop the investigations against the imams . 
The xxxxxxxxxxxx commented that the religious community viewed [PER Saif  ] al-Islam 's efforts on behalf of the imams as a cynical ploy to enhance his political stature . 
Rolling his eyes upward , the businessman said that " he " ( meaning [MISC Libyan  ] leader [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi ) wants to portray [PER Saif  ] al-Islam as a savior . 
THE CRESCENT MOON RISES EARLIER IN [LOC LIBYA  ] 5 . 
( C ) After several days of criticism in blogs and opposition websites , [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi made a lengthy public statement defending [LOC Libya  ] 's decision to observe [ORG Eid  ] on November 26 on scientific grounds . 
During the speech ( reminiscent of his description of the effects of jet lag at his address to the [ORG UN TRIPOLI  ] 00000961 002.2 OF 002 General Assembly ) , al-Qadhafi explained that the time difference between [LOC Libya  ] and other countries enabled scientists at the [ORG Libyan Center for Remote Sensing  ] to detect the crescent moon marking the feast with greater accuracy than other religious authorities ; therefore , [LOC Libya  ] should celebrate the feast one day earlier than the rest of the world . 
The explanation did little to quell the rumor in [LOC Tripoli  ] that al-Qadhafi had ordered the date change after [MISC Saudi  ] officials denied his request to perform the [ORG Hajj  ] with an entourage of 800 and to mark the occasion with a short speech at [LOC Mecca  ] . 
In the view of our business contact , al-Qadhafi " wanted to show the [MISC Saudis  ] he 's different . 
" COMMENT 6 . 
( C ) [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi 's controversial decision to unilaterally declare the [ORG Eid  ] al-Adha celebration one day earlier than the rest of the world can be just as easily attributed to his quirkiness and desire for individuality as to political conspiracy designed to cast his son in a positive light , or yet another episode in his lengthy feud with the [MISC Saudis  ] . 
While the impact of this rare display of public grumbling should not be overstated , [PER Saif  ] al-Islam 's quick intervention indicates the [MISC Libyan  ] Government recognized the negative effects of its decision to change the date . 
And [PER Saif  ] al-Islam 's intervention may also be interpreted as another sign of his political ascendancy .
