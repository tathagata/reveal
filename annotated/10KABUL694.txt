( [LOC C/NF  ] ) In a February 17 meeting , Interior Minister [PER Mohammed Hanif Atmar  ] told Ambassador [PER Holbrooke  ] , Ambassador Eikenberry , and General [PER Caldwell  ] that: -- he wants to train 2,000-3,000 police officer candidates outside of [LOC Afghanistan  ] , each year for the next five years . 
[PER Atmar  ] is looking at [LOC Jordan  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] , and the [LOC UAE  ] as possible training sites. -- while [LOC GIRoA  ] cannot take reintegrated insurgents into the Army or Police , [PER Atmar  ] 's plan for a local defense initiative ( septel ) and public companies for infrastructure and agricultural development would meet reintegrees' economic and security needs . 
-- [MISC Saudi  ] intervention ; the finalization of [LOC GIRoA  ] 's insurgent reintegration program ; and the success of the [ORG Marjah  ] operations would all move insurgent reintegration forward. -- while [PER Atmar  ] favors 16 weeks of training for police ( which would enable full literacy training ) he believes [ORG NATO Training Mission Afghanistan  ] ( [ORG NTM-A  ] ) 's plan for a condensed six week program as acceptable , providing the number of training hours remains the same . 
END SUMMARY INTERNATIONAL TRAINING FOR [MISC AFGHAN  ] POLICE ---------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) Noting that police growth is enormously constrained by a lack of trainers and training space , Minister [PER Atmar  ] wants to send 2,000-3,000 [MISC Afghan  ] police officer ( as distinct from enlisted ) trainees to [LOC Jordan  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] , and the [LOC UAE  ] for training each year for the next five years . 
[PER Atmar  ] 's first choice is the [ORG International Police Training Center  ] in [LOC Jordan  ] , which has room for 1,000 trainees per year ; facilities in [LOC Turkey  ] and the [LOC UAE  ] ( [ORG Sharjah Police Academy  ] and an under-utilized [LOC UAE  ] military facility 100kms from [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] ) could take another 1,000 trainees each . 
[PER Atmar  ] estimates an annual cost of $3,000 to $4,000 per pupil per year ( thus potential costs of $6 million to $12 million per year ) . 
[PER Atmar  ] wants [LOC Jordan  ] to contribute by waiving the cost of the facility and the lodging ; [ORG NATO/ISAF  ] would pay for transportation , food , and training materials ; and the cost of foreign trainers would be born by contributing nations. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) The Minister sees several advantages to this approach: [MISC European  ] nations would be more willing to send police trainers to [LOC Jordan  ] than to [LOC Afghanistan  ] ; the prospect of a year 's training abroad would draw young , educated [MISC Afghans  ] into the police officer corps ; a generation of [MISC Afghan  ] police officers trained overseas would help to break the [ORG ANP  ] 's culture of corruption ; [PER Atmar  ] would also send two [MISC Afghan  ] assistants for each international trainer , after three years these assistants would themselves be fully qualified trainers . 
Ambassador [PER Holbrooke  ] said he had already raised the issue with [MISC Jordanian  ] Foreign Minister [PER Judeh  ] , who was positive and promised to follow up . 
[ORG NTM-A Commanding  ] General [PER LTG Caldwell  ] told [PER Atmar  ] that [LOC UAE  ] , through its [ORG Kabul Defense Attach  ] , had made a formal offer to explore sending police trainers to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Atmar  ] asked Ambassador [PER Holbrooke  ] to engage the [MISC Arab  ] countries on [LOC Afghanistan  ] 's behalf , claiming that they would be more responsive to an [MISC American  ] approach . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] agreed to do so , and asked Lt. General [PER Caldwell  ] to provide him with precise asks . 
REINTEGRATION REQUIRES JOBS AND SECURITY ---------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) Minister [PER Atmar  ] said that hundreds of insurgents were approaching the government , and that a proper [LOC GIRoA  ] response to them would have to address issues of justice and amnesty , political inclusion , economic and security needs . 
Noting that we cannot take them into the police and the army , [PER Atmar  ] seeks to address the final two factors by creating a [ORG Local Defense Initiative  ] ( not yet approved by President [PER Karzai  ] ; see septel ) and two large public sector [LOC KABUL  ] 00000694 002 OF 002 companies , focusing respectively on infrastructure and agricultural projects . 
Foreign aid in those sectors would be channeled through these public contractors , which would employ former insurgents ( along with other [MISC Afghans  ] ) and provide them with limited job training ( of a month or two ) and a decent career . 
[PER Atmar  ] argued that microcredit won't work for insurgents ; they must be employed in a controlled and well-managed manner . 
He estimated that the public sector companies could absorb 10,000 to 15,000 unemployed [MISC Afghans  ] , including former insurgents who turned in their weapons , and former mujahideen disarmed through the [ORG Disarmament of Illegally Armed Groups  ] ( [ORG DIAG  ] ) and [ORG Disarmament  ] , Demobilization , and Reintegration ( [ORG DDR  ] ) programs. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Atmar  ] cited several factors that would move insurgent reintegration forward: [MISC Saudi  ] intervention ; the finalization of [LOC GIRoA  ] 's reintegration program ; and the effects of the [ORG Marjah  ] operation . 
Citing the arrest of [PER Mullah Berader  ] , [PER Atmar  ] said [MISC Pakistani  ] help on two more arrests -- those of [PER Mullah Mansoor  ] of the [ORG Quetta Shura  ] and [PER Maulavi Kabir  ] of [LOC Peshawar  ] -- would further spur reintegration by showing [MISC Taliban  ] that they could not rely on a [MISC Pakistani  ] safe-haven . 
[PER Atmar  ] said contacts tell us that [PER Berader  ] was arrested because he was in favor of reconciliation . 
Noting that both the Chief of Army Staff , General [PER Kayani  ] , and ISI Director [PER Ahmed Suja Pasha  ] were out of the country when [PER Berader  ] was arrested , Ambassador [PER Holbrooke  ] advised [PER Atmar  ] that we should be careful of drawing conclusions . 
[LOC POLICE: QUALITY  ] , [LOC QUANTITY  ] , AND TRAINING LENGTH: --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) Noting that police training and quality are on my mind , [PER Atmar  ] said he favored expanding police basic training to sixteen weeks ( from eight ) so it could include a full literacy element . 
Ambassador [PER Holbrooke  ] asked [PER Atmar  ] to comment on the apparent divergence of opinion between this position and [ORG NTM-A  ] 's plan to condense police training from eight to six weeks . 
[PER Atmar  ] noted that a six-week program with the same number of hours as the eight week ( as in [ORG NTM-A  ] 's proposal ) would be acceptable ; indeed , it would be necessary if [LOC Afghanistan  ] is to meet its goal of 109,000 police by October 31 , 2010 . 
However , [PER Atmar  ] then proposed to square this circle by reducing attrition and increasing retention while the international community increased the number of trainers -- enabling [LOC Afghanistan  ] to reach its growth goals while still providing a longer training course. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) Ambassador [PER Holbrooke  ] wondered if compressing the basic training curriculum from eight weeks to six would have a negative impact on quality , and wondered if 109k was an achievable target by October 30 , 2010 . 
The Minister said that a six week course would not lessen the quality of the force ; recruits would accept the longer days , he said . 
He argued that the police were on track to meet the 2010 growth goals , with roughly 92,000 police currently on duty , and another 6,000 de facto police present but not counted on the rolls . 
These over-Tashkil police , [PER Atmar  ] explained , are not paid by the internationally-funded [ORG Law and Order Trust Fund  ] for [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( [ORG LOTFA  ] ) , and thus are not counted by [ORG LOTFA  ] as official police . 
However , they are paid by private donors and customers ( through MoI ) for guarding projects like the [LOC Logar  ] copper mine , [MISC Indian  ] and [ORG Asian Development Bank  ] road projects , and [ORG UN  ] facilities . 
[PER Atmar  ] remarked that the shortages in the [ORG ANP  ] ranks were most serious with officers and NCOs , but not as serious in patrolmens' ranks. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) [ORG S/SRAP  ] has cleared this cable .
