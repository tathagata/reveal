Robert Manzanares  ] , reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Minister of Defense [PER Jose Bono  ] telephoned Charge February 22 to explain [LOC Spain  ] 's decision to sell military and civilian ships to [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
Saying he wished to follow up with Charge after [PER Bono  ] 's appearance before [ORG Congress  ] 's defense commission a day earlier ( during which the Defense Minister answered questions about the [LOC Venezuela  ] sale and [LOC Spain  ] 's [LOC Afghanistan  ] deployment ) , [PER Bono  ] explained that [LOC Spain  ] would likely sell a petroleum-carrying vessel , a ship that transports asphalt and five " patrol boats " to the [PER Chavez  ] government . 
He emphasized the [MISC Spanish  ] government has received " assurances " from [LOC Caracas  ] that the patrol ships will not be used for offensive purposes , but would be used to protect [LOC Venezuela  ] 's maritime borders and [ORG Exclusive Economic Zone  ] . 
( Note: Other sources have told us the ships are actually corvettes capable of being armed with naval guns and missiles . 
A press report indicated the vessels would be similar to [LOC Spain  ] 's " [MISC Descubierta  ] " class corevettes with a displacement of 1,500-1,800 tons . 
End note . 
) The principal reason [LOC Spain  ] was making the sale to [LOC Venezuela  ] -- reportedly worth over 600 million euros ( USD 780 million ) -- was to give a shot in the arm to ailing state-owned ship building firm [ORG Izar  ] . 
The sale would be " very significant for [ORG Izar  ] , " said [PER Bono  ] , but would not tip the military balance in the region . 
He also told Charge that the [ORG Zapatero  ] government had conferred with the [ORG Uribe  ] government and the [MISC Colombians  ] " did not see major problems " with the sale. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Bono  ] likewise telephoned Charge from [LOC Caracas  ] when he made his unannounced " discreet " trip there in late January to assure us he was not doing anything untoward . 
His latest call is another indication that the [ORG GOS  ] and [PER Bono  ] in particular well understand [LOC U.S.  ] concerns about [LOC Spain  ] 's developing relations with the [PER Chavez  ] government . 
Despite that , [ORG Izar  ] 's economic woes are front and center , driving [LOC Spain  ] 's intense interest in selling ships to [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
[LOC U.S.  ] concerns aside , [LOC Spain  ] will likely move forward to take advantage of an opportunity to tamp down labor unrest at the state-owned company .
