Johnson  ] per reasons 1.5 ( b ) - ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Summary:  ] The head of the detention unit of the [ORG International Criminal Tribunal  ] for the former [LOC Yugoslavia  ] ( [ORG ICTY  ] ) provided [ORG Embassy  ] legal officers and [ORG USG  ] physician with details of [PER Slobodan Milosevic  ] 's health status , daily regimen , legal and financial network , frame of mind , and contacts outside the [ORG Tribunal  ] . 
Among many revealing details , this official -- who sees and speaks with [PER Milosevic  ] more regularly and closely than nearly anybody else -- provided information indicating that [PER Milosevic  ] 's heart condition , while manageable on a day-to-day basis , is serious and not readily controlled by medication . 
At the same time the official discounted reports that [PER Milosevic  ] suffers from diabetes or , at least at present , depression . 
The official described a confident , engaged [PER Milosevic  ] who with his wife 's assistance ably manages a web of legal and political contacts . 
Through his [LOC Belgrade  ] legal advisers that rotate through the [ORG Hague  ] he exercises control over [ORG Social Party of Serbia  ] ( [ORG SPS  ] ) activities and coordinates legal strategy with the amici curiae , friends of the court . 
Meanwhile , the accused 's financial situation is precarious , necessitating a recent hat-passing exercise by the [ORG SPS  ] in order to generate funds to pay household staff and the travel of his lawyers . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Tim McFadden  ] an experienced [MISC Irish  ] prison warden and head of the [ORG ICTY  ] 's detention facility in [LOC Scheveningen  ] , provided embassy legal officers and [ORG USG  ] physician an unprecedented overview of [PER Slobodan Milosevic  ] 's life and activities since coming to trail . 
[PER McFadden  ] , whom one [ORG ICTY Registry  ] official described as " " the best of the best , " " is in a unique position not only to describe [PER Milosevic  ] 's detention , as he sees the defendant and interacts with him on a daily basis , but also to assess him on a relative basis to other [ORG ICTY  ] detainees . 
Moreover , [PER McFadden  ] is privy to the contents of [PER Milosevic  ] 's monitored telephone conversations and visits as well as the reports of the physicians that have examined him . 
[PER McFadden  ] has had long experience in managing tough prisoners , as he managed a number of [LOC UK  ] prisons holding [MISC Irish  ] [ORG Republican Army  ] detainees ; another [ORG Registry  ] official described [ORG ICTY  ] detainees as " " pussycats " " compared to [PER McFadden  ] charges in the [LOC UK  ] . 
Throughout the one-hour discussion , [PER McFadden  ] gave the impression of being fully and personally aware of all of the details of [PER Milosevic  ] 's detention , though he noted that [PER Milosevic  ] remains a private man who does not generally share his thoughts. ---------------------------- Associates and [ORG Frame of Mind  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER McFadden  ] firmly rejected reports that [PER Milosevic  ] was suffering from depression noting that the accused has given " " no indication that he would be anything but defiant to the process " " of his prosecution and that he demonstrates only a " " limited inclination toward depression . 
" " He noted that [PER Milosevic  ] 's inability to see his son , daughter , daughter-in-law , wife and grandson , especially the latter two , causes him substantial unhappiness . 
On the other hand , [PER McFadden  ] said that [PER Milosevic  ] " " has a job that distracts and preoccupies so that he is not apparently inclined to depression . 
" " He calls his wife , [PER Mirjana Markovic  ] , every morning , continuing what [PER McFadden  ] described as an " " extraordinary relationship " " ; [PER Milosevic  ] could manipulate a nation , he said , but struggled to manage his wife who , on the contrary , seemed to exert just such a pull on him . 
[PER McFadden  ] referred to a broad range of emotions and approaches that [PER Mira Markovic  ] deployed to goad or cajole [PER Milosevic  ] to take particular actions . 
When he failed to heed her advice , she was not beyond telling him that bad outcomes could have been avoided had he listened to her . 
[PER Markovic  ] served as a source of information , comfort , motivation , and strategy for [PER Milosevic  ] and he relied heavily on her guidance . 
When [PER Markovic  ] pressed [PER Milosevic  ] to do something he did not want to do , [PER Milosevic  ] rarely pushed back directly but simply never acted on the particular entreaty . 
[PER McFadden  ] referred back to the relationship a number of times in the discussion as the central one in [PER Milosevic  ] 's life . 
[PER McFadden  ] made clear that [PER Milosevic  ] 's blood pressure spike in September ( ref ) caused serious alarm at the [ORG Tribunal  ] , driving registry officers to consider ways in which to reduce his stress and , as one contact had previously said , " " make him happy . 
" " [PER McFadden  ] even described his proposal that the [ORG Registry  ] find a way to bring [PER Markovic  ] to The [ORG Hague  ] from [LOC Russia  ] with some immunity from arrest ( which the Deputy Registrar noted was not feasible ) , because [PER McFadden  ] believed so strongly that getting the two together could help keep down [PER Milosevic  ] 's stress and perhaps his blood pressure . 
He added , however , that even that was a risk because " " she can be a very volatile person . 
" " <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In the absence of his wife , [PER Milosevic  ] himself has had to coordinate the various groups providing him with legal and other assistance , previously her domain . 
It appears that her absence has left a substantial hole in his ability to organize the various entities purporting to assist him . 
He tries to maintain what [PER McFadden  ] called " " functional contacts " " with the [ORG SPS  ] and the Freedom ( [ORG Sloboda  ] ) [ORG Association  ] , but " " the [LOC Belgrade  ] crowd doesn't get on with the internationals , " " a relationship that [PER Markovic  ] used to manage and coordinate . 
Previously , [PER Markovic  ] would keep him up to date on wrangling within the [ORG SPS  ] and tell him who he needed to call to patch up feuds , solve conflicts , or provide political guidance to . 
Meanwhile , [PER Milosevic  ] 's financial position has worsened considerably since the spring ( i.e. , soon after the assassination of [PER Zoran Djindjic  ] ) . 
[PER Milosevic  ] fell five months in arrear in paying his [LOC Belgrade  ] household staff and was unable for a period to pay the air tickets of his rotating [LOC Belgrade  ] advisers . 
Ultimately , the condition worsened to such a degree that the [ORG SPS  ] was forced to " " to pass the hat " " to raise money on his behalf . 
The [ORG Registry  ] believes his financial problems will worsen . 
In an interesting sidenote , [PER McFadden  ] said that his [LOC Belgrade  ] contacts organized , and the [ORG Registry  ] consented to , an evaluation of [PER Milosevic  ] 's medical records by a group of physicians partial to him . 
The group concluded , following the review about 19 months ago , that his medical treatment ( described below ) met the requisite standard of care. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In the process of discussing [PER Milosevic  ] 's contacts , [PER McFadden  ] illuminated the nature of the relationship among the so-called legal associates ( [MISC Serb  ] lawyers who have no courtroom privileges but enjoy privileged communications with the defendant ) , the amici and [PER Milosevic  ] . 
[PER McFadden  ] said that [PER Milosevic  ] believes that " " he is surrounded by fools " " both inside and out of the courtroom , though he added in an aside that this was a problem of his own making , as he had surrounded himself with " " fools " " throughout his career out of a fear of being challenged by more competent and intelligent advisors . 
[PER Milosevic  ] most relishes the opportunity to examine senior level witnesses of his level and is disdainful of the lower level officials and witnesses paraded before him by the prosecution . 
The two associates who have spent much of the trial in the trial chamber 's public gallery ( [PER Zdenko Tomanovic  ] and [PER Dragoslav Ognjanovic  ] ) are , in [PER McFadden  ] 's view , " " messenger boys " " to ( unnamed ) associates in [LOC Belgrade  ] . 
[PER McFadden  ] knew little of [PER Branko Rakic  ] , the [LOC Belgrade  ] lawyer/law professor recently added as [PER Milosevic  ] 's third legal associate , but his initial impression was that he was contributing a more methodical , " " legal and logical " " approach to [PER Milosevic  ] 's defense and cross-examination preparations . 
As a result , [PER McFadden  ] expected [PER Milosevic  ] 's organization of his defense to improve. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In contrast to his courtroom disdain of the amici , [PER McFadden  ] said that [PER Milosevic  ] is in fact " " fond " " of them . 
Moreover , his public distancing of them actually masks the fact that his legal associates regularly liaise with the amici to discuss and coordinate defense strategy and questioning of witnesses . 
( Comment . 
[PER Milosevic  ] 's adept and hereto unknown coordination with the amici is a striking demonstration of his abilities and methods . 
By using his [LOC Belgrade  ] advisers to liaise with the amici in secret he is able to maintain the optically favorable appearance of a single man defending himself against an unfair and powerful international process . 
At the same time , he takes full advantage of the legal resources the amici offer and ensures that key technical legal points in his defense are covered so that he can focus on tending to the more political aspects of his defense . 
The fact that senior prosecutors on the [PER Milosevic  ] team are wholly unaware of this cooperation ( as were we ) underscores [PER Milosevic  ] 's ability to work effectively behind the scenes , through third parties , and leave few fingerprints . 
End comment ) . 
The Registrar noted that , as helpful as the amici might be to [PER Milosevic  ] now , he does not expect the amici to continue in their current role during the defense case . 
Their departure would be a significant blow to [PER Milosevic  ] 's defense unless he finally decides to accept legal counsel or is at least able to beef up his legal support from [LOC Belgrade.  ] --------------- [ORG Physical Health ---------------  ] 7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER McFadden  ] noted that [PER Milosevic  ] 's medical records from the former [LOC Yugoslavia  ] indicated a long history of hypertension ( high blood pressure ) that was difficult to control especially when [PER Milosevic  ] was stressed or excessively fatigued . 
He said that during the past summer a number of things happened that put [PER Milosevic  ] under increased stress and caused excessive fatigue , including the build up of stress from court appearances and trial preparations , his wife 's legal problems that caused her to flee to [LOC Russia  ] , the need for [PER Milosevic  ] to give increased time and attention to disputes and problems within the [ORG SPS Party  ] ( that would have formerly been handled in part by his wife ) , financial difficulties , and his gradual loss of attention from media . 
All of these factors appear to have contributed to the increase in [PER Milosevic  ] 's blood pressure . 
Physicians consistently found [PER Milosevic  ] had a diastolic blood pressure above 120 mm mercury ( normal should be below 90 mm mercury ) . 
Despite treatment with high doses of six medications his blood pressure remained dangerously elevated until the trial schedule was reduced to three days a week . 
( Note . 
The only information we have about his medications is that he was near the maximum dose of beta blockers and was also taking a medication that has to be stopped intermittently because of dangerous side effects . 
End note ) . 
[PER Milosevic  ] is now on four medications. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) A reduced trial schedule had been recommended by [MISC Dutch  ] physicians ( including [MISC Dutch  ] cardiologist , [PER Dr. Paul Van Dykman  ] ) last year but was rejected by the Court until [PER Milosevic  ] 's blood pressure could not be controlled with standard medications . 
His long history of hypertension has caused mild heart damage ( identified by [MISC Serb  ] physicians before he was apprehended and transferred to The [ORG Hague  ] ) but physicians have seen no evidence of a heart attack , stroke , or kidney damage . 
Three exercise EKGs have been normal and [PER Milosevic  ] will continue to have an exercise EKG twice a year according to [PER McFadden  ] . 
The last hypertensive episode ended about 6 weeks ago. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER McFadden  ] reports that [PER Milosevic  ] 's hypertensive episodes have not correlated with adverse events at the trial or with the appearance of certain witnesses . 
They have seen no evidence that he is using his blood pressure problems as an issue to slow or otherwise affect the trial . 
Moreover , [PER Milsoevic  ] understands that he has potentially lethal health problems and is a compliant patient . 
The only two physician recommendations he has refused are ( 1 ) to take sedatives recommended by his doctors to lower his blood pressure and ( 2 ) to undergo invasive procedures to look for underlying causes of his hypertension and evidence of end organ damage in the brain . 
He is allowed to cook for himself , which limits control of his diet , but he nevertheless appears to be following a salt restricted diet. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In contrast to previous reports that [PER Milsoevic  ] has diabetes , [PER McFadden  ] stated that there is no evidence in his medical records for this diagnosis and all of his blood sugars have been normal . 
[PER Milosevic  ] , s cholesterol and other lipids have been normal . 
His weight has been stable since he lost 12 pounds when he was first brought to The [ORG Hague  ] . 
He has not been observed to smoke much ; in a recent conversation with [PER McFadden  ] , he claimed not to have smoked in four days and to have no desire to do so . 
His only request , [PER McFadden  ] said , is for a glass of red wine , but alcohol is strictly forbidden in the detention unit. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Milosevic  ] is said by [PER McFadden  ] to have a nearly photographic memory , saying that he has " " never met a man with his memory . 
" " He said that a " " very important " " detainee , whom he would not identify , warned [PER McFadden  ] early in [PER Milosevic  ] 's detention that [PER Milosevic  ] has a very good memory that would " " come back to bite " " ; with a laugh , [PER McFadden  ] said it had . 
[PER McFadden  ] has seen no evidence of any deterioration in [PER Milosevic  ] 's memory or other mental capacities . 
He remains , [PER McFadden  ] said , as " " narcissistic a person " " as when he arrived in The [ORG Hague  ] . 
On the other hand , unlike other detainees who constantly complain , [PER Milosevic  ] is cooperative and always accepts [PER McFadden  ] 's decisions , often responding , " " at least I asked . 
" " In general , moreover , [PER Milosevic  ] believes strongly in his own powers and thinks that he is " " winning " " in the courtroom , an attitude that reinforces his currently stable health. ----------------------------------- Daily Regimen and [ORG Prison Activities  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Milosevic  ] 's routine varies depending on whether court is in session . 
Thus , on the three days of court proceedings per week , a typical day begins around 0700 with a wake-up call ; after he gets ready , he calls his wife around 0730 and leaves for court by 0800 . 
The court sessions run from 0900 to approximately 1400 , with two twenty minute breaks . 
After court , he returns to the detention center , where he has a meal and is allowed one hour of outdoor exercise ( [PER McFadden  ] noted that he will walk for a full hour , " " sun , rain or hail " " ) . 
Following the hour of exercise , he meets with legal advisors , reads the court transcripts , and otherwise prepares for the next court appearance . 
In the evening , he will typically read a book ( he is an avid reader , especially of " " rubbish " " and potboiler thrillers like [MISC Grisham  ] , and he prefers to read in the original [MISC English  ] ) . 
On days when he is not in court , he may sleep later , sometimes until 0930 or 1000 , have additional exercise time , attend " " creativity class , " " visit with his legal associates , have an afternoon nap , listen to [PER Sinatra  ] discs , and perhaps watch one of the [ORG DVD  ] 's that a privileged visitor ( i.e. most likely his [LOC Belgrade  ] lawyers ) have smuggled in to him. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Milosevic  ] has access to a laptop computer but is not allowed on the [MISC Internet  ] and cannot use E-mail . 
His access to the outside world is via phone calls or visits . 
He is allocated 75 euros per month for phone use , but can make an unlimited number of calls beyond that as long as he pays for the calls -- something he has consistently been able to do . 
He is allowed an unlimited number of free calls to recognized legal associates on a special detention unit phone . 
All of his phone calls and visits , except those with the recognized legal associates , are monitored. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Within the detention community , [PER Milosevic  ] is well liked and respected by other prisoners . 
Many of them take care to monitor his health and encourage him to watch his own diet , [PER McFadden  ] said . 
He has refused to see a psychiatrist individually but does participate in the group sessions with the other prisoners on his floor , which are monitored by the detention unit . 
The psychiatrist who conducts these sessions tells [PER McFadden  ] that she has seen no evidence that he is depressed or has any other significant clinical problem. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Comment: [PER Slobodan Milosevic  ] 's health surely puts him , in [PER McFadden  ] 's words , at " " higher risk of accident " " than similarly situated persons of his age who do not suffer hypertension . 
Yet his health seems to have stabilized for the time being , particularly since the trial chamber 's decision to go to three days per week . 
Whether [PER Milosevic  ] can maintain such a schedule will be tested when the defense case begins ( perhaps not before September 2004 ) . 
Some in the [ORG Registry  ] and in the Office of the Prosecutor speculate that the courtroom schedule will be further reduced to one day a week in order to allow [PER Milosevic  ] two days of defense preparation and , as the doctors have ordered , four days of rest . 
The end of the trial seems ever more distant when put in this light . 
Even with his health stabilized , the impact of the move to the defense phase will cause further pressures of a financial and legal nature which could in turn trigger a downturn in his health . 
For now , however , [PER Milosevic  ] remains comfortably on top of his game .
