( C ) SUMMARY . 
[LOC Brazil  ] has a central role in the climate change arena , not only because it controls 70% of the [LOC Amazon rainforest  ] , but also because it plays a pivotal role in the on-going [ORG UN Framework Convention  ] on Climate Change ( [ORG UNFCCC  ] ) negotiations . 
[ORG USG  ] efforts to have [LOC India  ] and [LOC China  ] assume binding targets under the [ORG UNFCCC  ] may hinge on the Government of [LOC Brazil  ] ( [ORG GOB  ] ) , s position in these talks . 
For this reason , Mission [LOC Brazil  ] suggests that the [ORG USG  ] start an active campaign to allay the [ORG GOB  ] , s concern about the effect that any eventual agreement will have on its ability to promote economic growth or about the possibility that a post-Kyoto agreement will expose them to potential trade sanctions or other punitive measures . 
Allaying the [ORG GOB  ] , s concerns on this front will make it possible for the [ORG GOB  ] to take a more helpful position in these negotiations. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Now is a propitious time and the [ORG USG  ] has the tools to shift the [ORG GOB  ] toward a more helpful position in the [ORG UNFCCC  ] negotiations . 
These tools include working with forward leaning state and local governments , facilitating technical assistance in forest management , and creating opportunities for more technology transfer . 
END SUMMARY . 
[LOC BRAZIL  ] IS KEY IN THE FIELD OF CLIMATE CHANGE <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Brazil  ] has a dual importance in the field of climate change . 
First , massive deforestation has made [LOC Brazil  ] , who has about 70 percent of the [LOC Amazon Forest  ] in its territory , the fifth largest carbon emitter since 1950 . 
For this reason , [LOC Brazil  ] , s management of its tropical forests will have a marked impact on the climate. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Second , the [ORG GOB  ] has honed to an art the ability to block international negotiations when it disagrees with an outcome . 
[LOC Brazil  ] , s potential spoiler role could undermine [ORG USG  ] , s efforts to convince [LOC China  ] and [LOC India  ] ( both non-Annex I countries to the [ORG UNFCCC  ] ) to take on emissions reductions targets . 
[LOC Brazil  ] has strenuously opposed non-Annex I countries assuming reduction targets , citing the &common but differential responsibilities8 clause in the [ORG UNFCCC  ] . 
WHAT ARE [LOC BRAZIL  ] , S PRIMARY INTERESTS ? <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Growth , growth , growth . 
President [PER Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  ] and his team have made economic growth the centerpiece of his second term ( 2006-2010 ) . 
[PER Lula  ] wants to bring a modicum of economic prosperity to his base: the approximately 20 million people living in the [LOC Amazon  ] region and the over 100 million more living in or near poverty in the rest of the country . 
A heightened emphasis on growth at the expense of environmental concerns was led to the departure in May 2008 of former Environment Minister [PER Marina Silva  ] ( considered an inflexible , absolutist on key environmental issues ) and her replacement by the more pragmatic Carols [PER Minc  ] . 
The [ORG GOB  ] does not consider climate change an immediate threat to [LOC Brazil  ] , and is not willing to sacrifice other priorities to address the problem. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG GOB  ] sees several areas of concern in the negotiations of the post-Kyoto framework . 
The [ORG GOB  ] fears that there will be trade sanctions imposed on those countries that do not meet emissions reduction targets . 
They are worried that the [MISC Europeans  ] would like to use a punitive regime to implement reductions . 
Moreover , they suspect that [LOC Europe  ] ( and to a lesser extent the [LOC United States  ] ) would use such trade sanctions as a non-tariff barrier to undermine [LOC Brazil  ] and third world competitors . 
Since approximately 80 percent of [LOC Brazil  ] , s emissions result from deforestation , [LOC Brazil  ] would need to have confidence that it could adequately control the rate of clearing before it could agree to binding international targets . 
The jump in deforestation figures for the 2007/2008 period shows that the government , s grip over the [LOC Amazon  ] remains weak ( [ORG REFTEL  ] A ) . <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG GOB  ] is also concerned by proposals for a sectoral approach . 
[ORG GOB  ] officials believe the sectoral approach could lead to significant constraints on the [MISC Brazilian  ] economy . 
Here again the [ORG GOB  ] sees the hidden hand of competitors in the developed world , where the mature industries are looking for ways to impede the rise of new competitors in the developing world . 
[ORG BRASILIA  ] 00000028 002.4 OF 003 <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Brazil  ] has looked favorably on other aspects of the climate change discussions that either do not threaten or could even boost economic growth . 
Thus , the [ORG GOB  ] presses hard for technology transfer and financial assistance to the developing world . 
It also has promoted its [ORG Amazonas Fund  ] , where international contributors provide [LOC Brazil  ] with funding ) but with no strings or oversight ) to help conserve the [LOC Amazon Forest  ] ( [ORG REFTEL  ] B ) . 
THREE POSSIBLE SCENARIOS <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [LOC Brazil  ] could take one of three approaches to the ongoing [ORG UNFCCC  ] negotiations: - The [MISC Spoiler:  ] This is [ORG GOB  ] , s current approach , which is to seek to prevent developing countries from assuming binding international obligations. - The [ORG Passive Partner:  ] The [ORG GOB  ] is willing to have [LOC China  ] and [LOC India  ] assume binding obligations , but does not use its influence to accomplish this end. - The Active [MISC Ally:  ] The [ORG GOB  ] works with the [ORG USG  ] to establish mechanisms to constrain emissions by developing countries . 
While it would be ideal to have the [ORG GOB  ] working side-by-side with the [ORG USG  ] in the international negotiations on a post-Kyoto agreement , it is more important that the [ORG GOB  ] does not block a deal satisfactory to the [ORG USG  ] . 
FIRST A REASSURING CAMPAIGN <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) A critical element for changing the [ORG GOB  ] , s approach to the negotiations is convincing them that the new regime , whether through overall emissions targets or by sectoral means , will not impede the [ORG GOB  ] , s drive to expand the economy . 
The [ORG USG  ] and [MISC Europeans  ] should launch a campaign in [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC Brasilia  ] , and in [MISC European  ] capitals ( to the [MISC Brazilians  ] ) to convince the [ORG GOB  ] of this important point . 
The [ORG USG  ] should also reach out to other stakeholders such as state and local governments , civil society groups , and opinion makers who can help allay the fears of the federal government . 
THE TIME IS RIGHT FOR COOPERATION <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) With adequate assurances over their prospective economic growth , we are at a propitious time move the [ORG GOB  ] to a [ORG Passive Partner  ] or even an Active Ally role in these negotiations . 
Minister [PER Minc  ] has signaled willingness for [LOC Brazil  ] to take a more ambitious approach toward climate change . 
[PER Minc  ] is close to the President , s powerful Chief of Staff , [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] , which could enhance his ability to influence the results of inter-ministerial debate . 
At the same time , Under Secretary for Political Affairs [PER Everton Vargas  ] ( who has the lead within the [ORG Ministry of External Relations  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) on climate change ) is expected to leave in February 2009 to become the [MISC Brazilian  ] Ambassador in [LOC Germany  ] . 
Under Secretary [PER Andre Amado  ] is taking over climate change negotiations for the [ORG MRE  ] . 
This change may provide the [ORG USG  ] with a greater opportunity to influence the [ORG GOB  ] position in the upcoming [ORG UNFCCC  ] negotiations . 
This opportunity is particularly important because the [ORG MRE  ] , rather than the [ORG Ministry of the Environment  ] ( [ORG MMA  ] ) , has retained the dominant role within the [ORG GOB  ] on these negotiations. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Equally important is the divide between the more forward leaning state governors of the [LOC Amazon  ] region and the federal government . 
The governors have been working on climate change and environmental initiatives that are more aggressive than those of the federal government . 
Their efforts demonstrate a growing sentiment within [LOC Brazil  ] that more can be done to combat climate change . 
These governors could be potential partners with the [ORG USG  ] in efforts to influence the [ORG GOB  ] 's position . 
SUGGESTED ACTION PLAN <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [ORG USG  ] and other developed nations have several tools at their disposal to encourage the [ORG GOB  ] to adopt a more helpful approach in these negotiations . 
The [ORG USG  ] should help to the [ORG GOB  ] to address its economic concerns by providing technology transfers/sharing ( such as with energy efficiency , clean energy , or biofuels ) ; and financial assistance . 
The [ORG USG  ] could start by building on existing mechanisms , such as the 2007 biofuels MOU , but the [ORG USG  ] should also look for new opportunities to continue and expand these endeavors. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) The [ORG USG  ] should simultaneously take action to persuade influential players in [LOC Brazil  ] , s elite circles to weigh in for a more constructive approach . 
These players include state government leaders , national legislators , the business community , [ORG Non-Governmental Organizations  ] , opinion leaders , and prominent scientists . 
This outreach could be accomplished through existing ties ( such as those that the Mission has developed with the governors of the nine states in the [LOC Amazon  ] region ) ; building relationships between [MISC Brazilian  ] legislators , scientists , and business leaders and their [LOC US  ] counterparts ; promoting and facilitating exchanges between [MISC Brazilian  ] and [LOC US  ] experts ; and increasing contact and communication with opinion leaders and [MISC Brazilian  ] NGOs with a focus on the compatibility of [LOC US  ] and [ORG GOB  ] interests in climate change negotiations. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) The [ORG USG  ] should also leverage its technical , scientific , and economic resources to help the [ORG GOB  ] tackle its deforestation problem . 
This could be accomplished by facilitating technical exchanges with the [ORG U.S. Forest Service  ] , the [ORG National Park Service  ] , the [ORG U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  ] , and the [ORG Bureau of Land Management  ] with an aim of helping strengthen [LOC Brazil  ] , s ability at the national , state and local levels to manage better its forests in a sustainable manner . 
The [LOC US  ] could also provide financial assistance and scientific and economic analysis to help the [ORG GOB  ] better understand current trends in deforestation and the likely impact of any policy changes. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) Finally , the [ORG USG  ] should continue to promote state and municipal activities to reduce deforestation . 
Helping these governments could produce positive results that could be replicated elsewhere in the region .
