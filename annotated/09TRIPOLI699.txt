REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( U ) This is an action request . 
See paragraph 7 . 
2 . 
( C ) Summary . 
[LOC Tripoli  ] is awash in frenzied preparations for the 40th anniversary of [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] 's " [ORG Al Fateh Revolution  ] , " a four-day extravaganza that will include the new " [MISC Libya-Italian Friendship Day  ] " ( to be attended by [MISC Italian  ] PM [PER Berlusconi  ] ) , an extraordinary [ORG African Union Summit  ] , and two days of military parades , speeches and concerts celebrating [PER Qadhafi  ] 's coup . 
We expect high-level diplomatic representation for the events , including: [LOC Jordan  ] 's King [PER Abdullah  ] , [PER Hugo Chavez  ] , [PER Hosni Mubarak  ] , and [LOC Pakistan  ] 's PM [PER Yousuf Gilani  ] . 
Banners in [LOC Green Square  ] extolling [ORG Pan Am  ] 103 bomber [PER Megrahi  ] as a hero ( leftover from the August 20 youth rally ) are the only hint of [PER Megrahi  ] 's possible participation in the festivities . 
We are hopeful that [MISC Libyan  ] officials are taking efforts to ensure [PER Megrahi  ] is not featured in the events . 
However , given the importance that [PER Megrahi  ] has played in [LOC Libya  ] 's domestic politics , there is a possibility that [PER Megrahi  ] could be a physical or rhetorical presence in the celebration . 
End Summary . 
PRE-EVENT ATMOSPHERICS 3 . 
( C ) Two miles of [LOC Tripoli  ] 's waterfront are being repurposed for what promises to be a grand celebration . 
A 150-foot-wide stage towers at least 50 feet above former park land in front of the state-owned [LOC Hotel Kabeer  ] , with a half-dozen [MISC Jumbotron  ] screens stretching back to the historic red fort of [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
Tents and dozens of trailers stretch 100 yards backstage as greenrooms for the yet-undisclosed program . 
A large , covered reviewing stand for the planned military tattoo has been erected in front of that fort between the infamous " [ORG Mussolini  ] balcony " and the mast of the [ORG USS Philadelphia  ] . 
[LOC Green Square  ] itself , normally a 400-car parking lot , sits empty . 
A stage and thousands of plastic chairs set up for an August 20 youth rally have been taken down , but banners with the [ORG Libyan Youth Foundation  ] 's logo hailing [LOC Lockerbie  ] bomber [PER Abdel Basset  ] al-Megrahi 's release and which refer to him as a " political hostage " and victim of " contradictory international standards " ( in [MISC Arabic  ] ) feature prominently on walls separating pedestrians from the last-minute work . 
4 . 
( C ) In typical [LOC Jamahiriya  ] fashion , organizers seem to have waited for the last possible moment to implement their grand plans . 
As young [MISC Libyan  ] men fasting for the holy month of [MISC Ramadan  ] lounge in parks near the event sites , hundreds of migrant workers hastily construct roads , tents , and stages in the 105-degree sun . 
The [LOC Corinthia  ] , [LOC Tripoli  ] 's main hotel , has had all bookings taken over by [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Protocol  ] . 
A second international-class hotel operated by [ORG Radisson  ] will be opened two months ahead of schedule to house [ORG AU Summit  ] delegates . 
Dozens of workers are frantically putting finishing touches as an army of movers places furniture in the guest rooms . 
The site for the [ORG AU Summit  ] , to be held August 30 and 31 , lies on what was three weeks ago a harbor-side amusement park . 
Two tents , each approximately 5,000 square feet , and a few side halls indicate that [LOC Libya  ] will likely keep delegate counts much lower than July 's summit in [LOC Sirte  ] . 
The [ORG Summit  ] tents are situated on a jetty separating [LOC Tripoli  ] 's commercial harbor from a naval/coast guard station . 
During a site visit on the morning of August 27 , [PER Poloff  ] observed two military helicopters circling the site , along with several small patrol boats in formation . 
GUESSING GAME - WILL [PER MEGRAHI  ] ATTEND ? 5 . 
( C ) In spite of the left over banners from the August 20 [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] youth rally , the stage setting for September 1 does not indicate that [PER Megrahi  ] will be a theme , nor does the official program provided by [ORG MFA Protocol  ] ( ref A ) feature activities focused on [PER Megrahi  ] . 
GOL interlocutors have also provided assurances that [PER Megrahi  ] will not be present on September 1 ( ref B ) . 
Those contacts have hinted that [PER Megrahi  ] 's return was important to [PER Qadhafi  ] 's domestic audiences - particularly key tribal and [ORG Revolutionary Committee  ] ( [ORG RevComm  ] ) figures who keep [PER Qadhafi  ] in power . 
As stated in previous reporting , GOL interlocutors are attempting to pressure [PER Megrahi  ] not to attend the September 1 events if invited , as they realize that they cannot control [PER Qadhafi  ] 's actions ( ref B ) . 
Even if [PER Megrahi  ] does not attend , however , the question remains whether [PER Qadhafi  ] will hail him as a hero during his remarks . 
LIKELY PARTICIPATION [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000699 002.2 OF 002 6 . 
( C ) Press reports and diplomatic contacts indicate strong head of state/government attendance: [LOC Jordan  ] 's King [PER Abdullah  ] , [PER Hugo Chavez  ] , [PER Hosni Mubarak  ] , [LOC Pakistan  ] PM [PER Yousuf Gilani  ] , and President of The [ORG Philippines Gloria Arroyo  ] are among the probable attendees . 
Many [MISC Western  ] nations will also send high-level delegates , including the [MISC Spanish  ] Foreign Minister , the [MISC French  ] Minister of Cooperation , the [MISC Italian  ] Minister of [LOC Defense  ] , and the Head of the [MISC Russian  ] [ORG Duma  ] . 
The September 1 events will be the pinnacle of a week-long gala that begins on August 30 with [MISC Libyan-Italian Friendship Day  ] , PM [MISC Berlusconi  ] 's state visit , and the preparatory meetings for the extraordinary [ORG Summit  ] of the [ORG AU Summit  ] . 
Several nations are sending military demonstration units to perform during the week and participate in a large tattoo on September 2 , including aerial demonstrations units from [LOC Italy  ] and [LOC Jordan  ] and cultural performers to include [MISC Ukrainian  ] , [MISC Moroccan  ] , [MISC Algerian  ] , [MISC Tunisian  ] , and [MISC Egyptian  ] dancers . 
Despite persistent rumors , there is no indication that international pop acts , such as Beyonce , [PER Celine Dion  ] , or [PER Shakira  ] will perform . 
[LOC U.S.  ] PARTICIPATION 7 . 
( C ) As the [ORG Department considers possible  ] [LOC U.S.  ] attendance at the September 1 event , we note that we are hopeful that GOL officials are in fact taking measures to ensure [PER Megrahi  ] will not feature prominently in the program . 
But even if [PER Megrahi  ] himself is not physically present , it is possible that some of the speeches or other events could make reference to him . 
Should the [ORG Department instruct  ] us to attend the September 1 event , we request guidance on how to handle [PER Megrahi  ] 's presence -- physical or rhetorical -- in the program . 
UK Ambassador informed us that , if he is authorized to attend , he will be under instruction to walk out if [PER Megrahi  ] attends .
