Russell  ] for Reasons 1.5 ( b ) and ( d ) . 
1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG TNK-BP  ] President , [PER AmCit Robert Dudley  ] , gave an interview to the [MISC Russian  ] business daily [ORG Vedomosti  ] , which was published in their Monday May 26 edition . 
In the interview , [PER Dudley  ] aired [ORG BP  ] 's differences with its [MISC Russian  ] partners , including over international projects . 
The most sensational aspect of the interview was his accusation of " managerial violations " by some in the company that had deliberately understated to the [ORG GOR  ] the number of visas needed for the company 's expats , putting their status and the company 's operations in jeopardy . 
2 . 
( C ) In a May 28 meeting with [ORG ECMIN  ] , [PER AmCit Shawn McCormack  ] , [ORG TNK-BP  ] 's Vice President for International Relations ( strictly protect ) said that [ORG BP  ] had made a decision to forcefully respond to the continuing efforts of their [MISC Russian  ] partners , especially [ORG Alfa Group  ] billionaires [PER Mikeil Fridman  ] , [MISC German  ] [PER Khan  ] , and [PER Petr Aven  ] , to undermine [ORG BP  ] 's position in the partnership ( reftels ) . 
[ORG BP  ] had decided to go forward with a [LOC PR  ] campaign , including the [ORG Vedomosti  ] interview and a series of press briefings on background that would further expose their partner 's bad faith . 
3 . 
( C ) [PER McCormack  ] said that there was no truth to the rumor that the [MISC Russian  ] partners , collectively known as the [ORG AAR  ] group ( after the initials of their companies: [ORG Alfa  ] , Access , and [ORG Renova  ] ) had asked [ORG BP  ] Chairman [PER Tony Hayward  ] for [PER Dudley  ] to resign . 
However , [ORG BP  ] expected [ORG AAR  ] to formally request [PER Dudley  ] 's resignation at [ORG TNK-BP  ] 's May 29 [ORG Board Meeting  ] in [LOC Cyprus  ] . 
[ORG BP  ] would refuse and given the 50/50 split in the company [ORG AAR  ] would be unable to force [PER Dudley  ] out . 
4 . 
( C ) xxxxxxxxxxxx 5 . 
( C ) [PER McCormack  ] said the bigger picture remained unchanged: [ORG Gazprom  ] still wanted to buy out the [MISC Russian  ] half of [ORG TNK-BP  ] and pursue a global partnership with [ORG BP  ] . 
The [ORG AAR  ] billionaires were using their wealth and connections within the [ORG GOR  ] to fight off [ORG Gazprom  ] on one front while trying to seize greater control of the company from [ORG BP  ] on another . 
He expected the " war " to continue and even intensify in the coming weeks . 
6 . 
( C ) Update: [PER McCormack  ] called late in the evening May 29 to report that the [ORG TNK-BP Board  ] meeting had broken down in acrimony following [ORG AAR  ] 's efforts to remove [PER Dudley  ] , which [ORG BP  ] refused , and [ORG BP  ] 's efforts to force out [PER Khan  ] , which [ORG AAR  ] had rejected . 
[PER McCormack  ] said [ORG BP  ] expected the attacks on their executives at [ORG TNK-BP  ] , especially [PER Dudley  ] , to worsen in the aftermath .

( C ) [PER Summers  ] , a [LOC UK  ] citizen ( please protect ) , said that [ORG BP  ] 's dispute with [ORG AAR  ] head reached the " end of the beginning " and that [ORG BP  ] CEO [PER Tony Hayward  ] had met in [LOC Prague  ] with [PER Mikheil Fridman  ] the day before , July 30 , to negotiate a " cease-fire . 
" ( N.B . 
The meeting has since been reported in the press . 
) [PER Summers  ] , however , likened it to an [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] cease-fire in which [PER Khan  ] would play the role of [ORG Hamas  ] , ready with some provocation or incident that would restart hostilities . 
Moreover , of all the partners , [PER Khan  ] was the least leveraged and therefore had the least to lose if the dispute dragged on and the company 's performance suffered and payouts were delayed . 
He also had the least exposure outside [LOC Russia  ] were [ORG BP  ] to push the button and start seizing the [ORG AAR  ] assets through arbitration . 
3 . 
( C ) [PER Summers  ] said a longer-term resolution of the dispute would depend on reaching agreement in four areas: picking a new CEO , agreeing on governance issues , agreeing on the level and nature of [ORG BP  ] support to [ORG TNK-BP  ] , and on " liquidity . 
" He said [PER Dudley  ] was unlikely to return . 
However , [PER Summers  ] felt [PER Fridman  ] had overplayed his hand , and was now getting pressure from the [ORG GOR  ] to resolve the dispute and was therefore unlikely to play hardball on the identity of the new CEO . 
4 . 
( C ) [PER Summers  ] said the second issue , corporate governance , was central to control of the company and would be the most difficult to resolve . 
The structure of the [ORG Board  ] , the presence of independent directors , the authorities of the CEO , and structure of the subsidiary companies were the keys to [ORG BP  ] protecting its investment in the company . 
He added that the opaque nature of [LOC Russia  ] 's legal system made this even more essential from [ORG BP  ] 's point of view and that any foreign investor in [LOC Russia  ] should have in its hands at a minimum the Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ) and the head of internal auditing . 
5 . 
( C ) On [ORG BP  ] 's level of support , [PER Summers  ] said the questions revolved around whether [ORG BP  ] would provide technical skills to [ORG TNK-BP  ] in the form of secondees and if so how many and under what terms . 
He noted that [ORG AAR  ] and the [MISC Russian  ] Government knew full well that the company could not be run successfully without foreign employees . 
First , there were simply not enough skilled [MISC Russian  ] petroleum engineers and second the [MISC Russian  ] engineers' skills were not to world standards . 
What the foreign personnel had brought to [ORG TNK-BP  ] and other [MISC Russian  ] oil companies were not only more sophisticated drilling techniques but also an integrated approach to the work that maximized production . 
As an aside , [PER Summers  ] said he was very pessimistic that [LOC Russia  ] would ever be able to get its production over 10 million barrels a day and predicted instead a steady decline in production as the current fields were depleted and few if any new fields were brought on line . 
6 . 
( C ) [PER Summers  ] said liquidity was really [ORG AAR  ] 's issue as their ultimate goal was to take value out of the company . 
Decisions would how much to pay out , including in the form of dividends , and how much to invest back into the company . 
[PER Summers  ] added that while the [ORG AAR  ] partners overall goal was clear enough ) make as much money as they could ) they had no real strategy for achieving that and instead approached everything tactically , and that the preferred tactics of the [ORG Alfa  ] partners in particular were to play rough . 
They had felt pressured from the government to sell at a discount , disrespected by a [ORG BP  ] that had been weakened by its transition [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00002237 002 OF 002 to a new CEO , and had decided to make themselves difficult until they were accommodated . 
7 . 
( C ) If the negotiations were to fail , [PER Summers  ] said [ORG BP  ] would react decisively . 
He said [ORG BP  ] had not reacted fast enough or aggressively enough as the dispute had gathered steam but was " angry and fully awake " now and ready to go to arbitration if necessary. ----------------------------- [MISC German  ] [PER Khan  ] and the [PER Godfather  ] ----------------------------- 8 . 
( C ) [PER Summers  ] said he had a complicated and sometimes difficult relationship with [PER Khan  ] , though it was not as difficult as [PER Dudley  ] 's relationship had been . 
It was complicated because although they were technically on the same level in the company , [PER Khan  ] as a part owner out-ranked him . 
However , at the same time , [PER Khan  ] knew very little about the oil business , knew it , and therefore deferred to [PER Summers  ] on running the company . 
With [PER Dudley  ] , he added , part of [PER Khan  ] 's anger was because [PER Dudley  ] was the boss and had thwarted several of [PER Khan  ] 's pet projects , such as investing in " rogue " states . 
9 . 
( C ) [PER Summers  ] added that [PER Khan  ] was a very difficult person to work with. xxxxxxxxxxxx They had flown out to [PER Khan  ] 's hunting lodge , which [PER Summers  ] said was like a [ORG Four Seasons  ] hotel in the middle of nowhere . 
At dinner that evening , [PER Khan  ] had told a stunned [PER Summers  ] that The [PER Godfather  ] was his favorite movie , that he watched it every few months , and that he considered it a " manual for life . 
" [PER Khan  ] had also come to dinner armed with a chrome-plated pistol . 
10 . 
( C ) [PER Summers  ] said that after the trip he had gotten a copy of The [PER Godfather  ] and now watched it on a regular basis himself so as to better understand [PER Khan  ] and anticipate his tactics . 
He added that [PER Khan  ] 's aggressive but relatively simple business style was typically [MISC Russian  ] where multi-million dollar deals are made in smoke-filled rooms in a matter of a few hours and only later are turned over to the accountants to see if they make sense . 
It was not a style that meshed well with [ORG BP  ] and that culture clash was in part responsible for the acrimony of the dispute , as [PER Khan  ] had never felt [ORG BP  ] treated him with sufficient respect . 
11 . 
( C ) [PER Summers  ] added that [PER Khan  ] had gone along with Deputy Prime Minister [PER Sechin  ] on his trip to [LOC Cuba  ] this week . 
[PER Khan  ] had been very nervous about the trip , since he would not be the headliner but instead would be surrounded by other powerful [MISC Russian  ] oligarchs , including [PER Sechin  ] and [ORG Gazprom  ] 's [PER Alexander Medvedev  ] . 
[PER Summers  ] said nothing was likely to come out of the trip . 
[LOC Cuba  ] 's potential deposits were small and the geology was complicated . 
Even [PER Khan  ] was not really interested and [PER Summers  ] doubted any other [MISC Russian  ] oil company would be interested either. ----------- [ORG Visa Update  ] ----------- 12 . 
( C ) [ORG TNK-BP  ] 's VP for International Relations , Amcit [PER Shawn McCormick  ] , updated us the morning of August 1 on the visa situation within the company . 
According to [PER McCormick  ] , work visas have been trickling in all week for the foreign employees , including a batch of 18 that morning . 
Although the company is still waiting for 23 additional visas , [PER McCormick  ] said that all of foreign employees in " key/critical " positions , with the exception of [PER Dudley  ] , have now received visas and work permits ( this includes [PER McCormick  ] ) .
