( [ORG SBU/NF  ] ) Summary: Embassy [ORG Tripoli  ] warmly welcomes your visit and believes it will be an important occasion to advance the bilateral relationship in several key areas . 
Following the signature of the [ORG U.S.-Libya Comprehensive Claims Settlement Agreement  ] in October 2008 , the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Libya  ] established full diplomatic relations , including the exchange of Ambassadors in January 2009 for the first time in 37 years . 
The normalization of relations has provided the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Libya  ] with increasing opportunities to push for progress in areas of mutual concern , such as counterterrorism efforts , military-to-military cooperation , regional stability in greater [LOC Africa  ] , and trade and investment . 
However , significant challenges remain , particularly in ensuring [LOC Libya  ] meets its disarmament commitments and in encouraging the government to expand political space through a human rights dialogue . 
We believe it would be very helpful if you emphasized to your [MISC Libyan  ] interlocutors the importance the [LOC U.S.  ] places on progress in these key areas , and share your vision of how the relationship could develop once outstanding issues are resolved . 
End summary . 
2 . 
( [ORG SBU/NF  ] ) Your visit represents the highest-level visit by a [ORG U.S. Government  ] delegation since former Secretary of State [PER Condoleeza Rice  ] 's historic and well-received visit in September 2008 . 
The [MISC Libyan  ] Government is taking great pains to ensure that you have a positive experience as well , and will be listening for cues on the future direction of the relationship . 
Your visit comes just three weeks before the 40th anniversary of [PER Qadhafi  ] 's coup on September 1 , and falls within a year of unprecedented international prominence for [LOC Libya  ] and for [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] , who sees himself as a man of particular historical importance , currently holds the chairmanship of the [ORG African Union  ] ( [ORG AU  ] ) , and is expected to lead his country 's delegation to [LOC New York  ] this fall , as his country takes on the presidency of the 64th [ORG UN General Assembly  ] . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] has leveraged his position as [ORG AU Chair  ] to improve [LOC Libya  ] 's relations with [MISC European  ] nations , paying recent state visits to [LOC France  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , and [LOC Italy  ] , among other nations . 
As a sign that he has normalized relations with [LOC Libya  ] 's former colonial ruler , [PER Qadhafi  ] will host [PER Silvio Berlusconi  ] for a [MISC Libyan-Italian  ] " [MISC Friendship Day  ] " at the end of the month . 
A meeting with POTUS on the margins of [ORG UNGA  ] would be the capstone of [PER Qadhafi  ] 's historic year , but [ORG Embassy  ] and high-level [ORG State Department  ] officials have emphasized that [LOC Libya  ] must take specific actions to move forward the bilateral relationship prior to a potential meeting . 
SECURITY 3 . 
( [ORG SBU/NF  ] ) [LOC Libya  ] 's decision to give up its WMD programs and to renounce its support for terrorism opened the door for a wide range of cooperation in areas of mutual concern . 
[LOC Libya  ] has acted as a critical ally in [LOC U.S.  ] counterterrorism efforts , and [LOC Libya  ] is considered one of our primary partners in combating the flow of foreign fighters . 
Our strategic partnership in this field has been highly productive and beneficial to both nations . 
We have begun some successful training programs to assist [LOC Libya  ] in improving its security capabilities , under the rubrics of anti-terrorism assistance and border security . 
However , the government has not wanted to commit to participate in the [ORG Trans Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership  ] ( [ORG TSCTP  ] ) due to an incorrect perception that [ORG TSCTP  ] is a regional organization , designed to provide [LOC U.S.  ] foreign assistance to countries in need . 
[LOC Libya  ] is very sensitive to receiving foreign aid , insisting that it is not a needy country but rather a patron nation of others . 
We believe it would be helpful if you could clarify the importance of [ORG TSCTP  ] for obtaining congressional funding for bilateral security programs in [LOC Libya  ] . 
4 . 
( [ORG SBU/NF  ] ) [LOC Libya  ] has stated its number one priority , in return for relinquishing WMD , is a security guarantee by the [LOC U.S.  ] against foreign aggression . 
To that end , [LOC Libya  ] has expressed an interest in purchasing lethal weapons from [LOC U.S.  ] firms . 
It would be helpful if you could provide congressional perspectives on lethal sales to [LOC Libya  ] and the security commitments that must be fulfilled prior to any [LOC U.S.  ] consideration of lethal sales . 
The [ORG GOL  ] has also expressed a desire to receive in operational order the eight [MISC C-130  ] planes that [LOC Libya  ] purchased in the 1970 's , which were never delivered to [LOC Libya  ] . 
Although the [ORG USG  ] views the case as a strictly commercial matter between [LOC Libya  ] and [ORG Lockheed Martin  ] , the manufacturer of the [MISC C-130s  ] , the aircraft are stored at a [LOC U.S.  ] airbase , and the [ORG U.S. Air Force  ] is encouraging [ORG Lockheed Martin  ] to propose a compromise . 
Notably , the [ORG GOL  ] has not yet agreed to end-use monitoring or security of [LOC U.S.  ] technology agreements - two necessary steps for expanded [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000648 002.2 OF 003 military-to-military cooperation , such as [ORG International Military Education and Training  ] ( [ORG IMET  ] ) programs . 
WMD COMMITMENTS 5 . 
( [ORG SBU/NF  ] ) Progress in other areas of the bilateral relationship will depend on [LOC Libya  ] 's continued progress toward fulfillment of its WMD-related commitments . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] is ready to launch a civil-nuclear dialogue as a framework for discussing ways in which we can expand our nuclear cooperation in areas such as the establishment of a [ORG Regional Nuclear Medicine Center  ] , cooperative threat reduction , scientist engagement and redirection programs , and civil-nuclear engagement . 
However , we are unable to consider expanded cooperation until [LOC Libya  ] makes good-faith efforts to meet the following critical deadlines for destruction and/or disposal of its WMD and related materials: -September 2009: Transfer of highly enriched uranium fuel to [LOC Russia  ] , and beginning destruction of [MISC SCUD  ] Bs ; -2010: Conversion of [LOC Rabta  ] chemical site to a pharmaceutical plant , and destruction of precursor chemicals ; -2011: Destruction of mustard agent . 
6 . 
( [ORG SBU/NF  ] ) The most pressing issue remains [LOC Libya  ] 's signing of the agreement to transfer its highly enriched uranium to [LOC Russia  ] for treatment and disposal , an action that must be taken prior to August 15 , 2009 , if [LOC Libya  ] is going to meet the September deadline for disposal . 
The [ORG GOL  ] is keenly interested in the establishment of the [ORG Regional Nuclear Medicine Center  ] as an example of the success of the bilateral relationship . 
Your interlocutors may raise the issue of [LOC U.S.  ] funding for the [ORG Regional Nuclear Medicine Center  ] , which is a request that the [ORG Department of Energy  ] is currently preparing for submission to [ORG Congress  ] . 
[ORG REGIONAL COOPERATION  ] 7 . 
( [ORG SBU/NF  ] ) [LOC Libya  ] 's strategic geographical position and current role as chair of the [ORG African Union  ] make it a significant player on the continent . 
[LOC Libya  ] has thus far cooperated with [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to foster peace in [LOC Darfur  ] and a foundational effort to forge a ceasefire between [LOC Sudan  ] and [LOC Chad  ] . 
The [ORG USG  ] continues to support [LOC Libya  ] 's efforts within the [ORG AU Peace and Security Commission  ] to promote good governance and rule of law . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] has used his role as Chair of the [ORG African Union  ] to attempt to mediate conflicts in the sub-Saharan region , to include [LOC Sudan-Chad  ] , [LOC Somalia  ] , and [ORG Eritrea-Ethiopia  ] . 
[LOC Libya  ] hosted an [ORG African Union  ] Summit in July , during which it advocated to strengthen the [ORG AU  ] , and it is preparing to host another summit on regional peace and security on August 31 . 
8 . 
( [ORG SBU/NF  ] ) As [PER Qadhafi  ] has broadened his engagement as an [MISC African  ] leader , he has notably minimized his efforts to affect policy in the [MISC Arab  ] world . 
Nevertheless , he continues to tout his vision for a one-state solution between the [MISC Israelis  ] and the [MISC Palestinians:  ] " Isratine . 
" The [MISC Libyans  ] will appreciate any information you would like to share regarding how [ORG Congress  ] views [LOC Africa  ] , the [MISC Arab  ] world in general and the [LOC Middle East  ] peace process in particular . 
[ORG HUMAN RIGHTS  ] , [PER MEGRAHI  ] 9 . 
( [ORG SBU/NF  ] ) Human rights remains a sensitive topic in the bilateral relationship , particularly in the wake of [PER Fathi  ] el-Jahmi 's death in May . 
The [MISC Libyan  ] Government has agreed to host an interagency team of [ORG USG  ] officials August 17-19 to launch a bilateral [ORG Human Rights Dialogue  ] . 
This first meeting will set the agenda for the dialogue , which will include general discussion on a broad range of issues , such as international conventions to which both the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Libya  ] are party ; refugees and migration ; prisons and detention facilities ; international bodies and international [ORG NGOs  ] ; as well as specific cases of concern from both sides . 
The [ORG USG  ] delegation will be led by the Acting Assistant Secretary of [ORG State for Democracy , Human Rights  ] , and Labor , and will include representatives from the [ORG NSC  ] , [ORG OVP  ] , and [ORG State Department  ] . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] views this dialogue as an important step forward in our relationship . 
It would be very helpful if you could share your views on the importance of human rights to bilateral engagement . 
10 . 
( [ORG SBU/NF  ] ) The Government of [LOC Libya  ] has not officially raised the case of convicted [MISC Pan Am 103  ] bomber [PER Abdel Basset  ] al-Megrahi with the [ORG Embassy  ] at any level . 
We do not expect the issue to be raised during your visit , but if it is , we believe the most [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000648 003.2 OF 003 helpful response would be to note that this is an issue for the [ORG Scottish Executive  ] and that it would not be constructive to discuss the case as a bilateral issue . 
[LOC Libya  ] requested compassionate release for [PER Megrahi  ] on July 24 , but the [MISC Scottish  ] courts have not yet issued a decision on granting his release . 
[ORG HOMELAND SECURITY: VISAS AND PORT-OF-ENTRY PROCEDURES  ] 11 . 
( [ORG SBU/NF  ] ) As part of our effort to expand relations and facilitate greater people-to-people exchanges , [ORG Embassy Tripoli  ] began full non-immigrant visa services in April 2009 . 
Unfortunately , we have not seen reciprocal movement on the [MISC Libyan  ] side . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] is coordinating a bilateral working group with [ORG GOL  ] counterparts to discuss visa issues , including non-issuance of visas to [LOC U.S.  ] diplomats and official visitors , business travelers , and tourists . 
It would be helpful if you could underscore with [MISC Libyan  ] officials the importance of a fully normalized visa regime to the implementation of fully normalized relations with the [LOC United States  ] . 
12 . 
( [ORG SBU/NF  ] ) [MISC Libyan  ] officials may complain about [ORG Department of Homeland Security  ] regulations and practices governing the way that they are received at [LOC U.S.  ] ports-of-entry . 
[MISC Libyan  ] travelers - including senior Government officials , in contravention of DHS procedures - are routinely pulled into secondary questioning due to [LOC Libya  ] 's status as an NSEERS country . 
DHS regulations dating back to 1983 also prohibit the travel to the [LOC U.S.  ] of [MISC Libyan  ] nuclear scientists and aircraft pilots and mechanics . 
[MISC Libyan  ] officials may not be aware of these latter regulations , but they must be changed in order to move forward on the full range of civil-nuclear and security cooperation that we envision . 
COMMENT 13 . 
( [ORG SBU/NF  ] ) The [ORG Embassy  ] has received positive signs from the [MISC Libyan  ] Government regarding your requested meeting with [PER Qadhafi  ] . 
Your visit will be seen as an important opportunity for [LOC Libya  ] to prove that it is worthy of respect as a bilateral partner . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] will be looking to you for insight into how [ORG Congress  ] views [LOC Libya  ] and the future of the bilateral relationship . 
Thank you in advance for any assistance you can provide in pushing forward our strategic agenda . 
We look forward to welcoming you in the [MISC Libyan  ] [LOC Jamahiriya  ] .
