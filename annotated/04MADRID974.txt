( C ) [PER Moratinos  ] opened the March 22 meeting with Ambassador [PER Argyros  ] by expressing his and President-elect [PER Zapatero  ] , s deep appreciation for the spirit and tone of the phone calls from President [PER Bush  ] to [PER Zapatero  ] and Secretary [PER Powell  ] to [PER Moratinos  ] . 
He said [PER Zapatero  ] has specifically asked him to convey to Ambassador [PER Argyros  ] that the [MISC Spanish  ] relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] would be his government 's high priority . 
[ORG PSOE  ] wanted to build on the close ties that the [ORG Popular Party  ] under President [PER Aznar  ] had built with the [LOC U.S.  ] It would be " stupidity " to end these ties , and [ORG PSOE  ] wants to build on this strong relationship , [PER Moratinos  ] said . 
[PER Moratinos  ] noted that [LOC Spain  ] will want to strengthen its ties with [LOC Europe  ] , " our family , " but that this does not contradict the need for close ties with the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG PSOE  ] wants rich [MISC U.S.-EU  ] ties and strong [MISC U.S.-Spanish  ] bilateral relations , he added . 
" We intend to work on the basis of no change " in our bilateral relations from the [ORG PP  ] government . 
He said that the difference between the [ORG PSOE  ] and [ORG PP  ] approach would be that while [ORG PSOE  ] would try to be " constructively involved " in [LOC Iraq  ] and the [LOC Middle East  ] , the new government would convey its concerns to the [LOC U.S.  ] , in the spirit of friendship and the desire to find common ground. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Moratinos  ] expressed appreciation for his phone call with Secretary [PER Powell  ] , which he called " excellent . 
" [PER Moratinos  ] said that he had encountered the Secretary on various occasions in his capacity as [ORG EU  ] envoy , and he would " never forget " the warmth of the Secretary 's contacts with him . 
In the phone call , [PER Moratinos  ] said he had expressed his desire , as soon as he is formally invested as Foreign Minister , to visit [LOC Washington  ] as his first trip . 
He reiterated this to the Ambassador . 
[PER Moratinos  ] said the objective would be to underscore our strong ties and to have a serious discussion about what we can and cannot do on certain issues , and to find common ground . 
He thought the government might be formally in place in the third week of April and would like to visit right after that. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 .

[PER Moratinos  ] said that [PER Zapatero  ] was concerned by the reaction by some press and " some sectors " in the [LOC U.S  ] . 
( but not the [ORG USG  ] itself ) that [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] handed [ORG PSOE  ] their electoral victory . 
This , [PER Moratinos  ] said , undermined the legitimacy of the [MISC Spanish  ] election results . 
[LOC Spain  ] is a serious democracy , he said , with a sense of pride and commitment in defending and supporting what [LOC Spain  ] has built through the years . 
[PER Moratinos  ] said that [ORG PSOE  ] " will not accept " criticism that [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] put [PER Zapatero  ] in power . 
He said this would be an insult to [PER Zapatero  ] , to [MISC Spanish  ] democracy and the [MISC Spanish  ] people . 
[PER Moratinos  ] asked for [ORG USG  ] help ) " Whatever you can do " to help dispel this image . 
This is a " redline " for [ORG PSOE  ] , he stressed . 
[ORG PSOE  ] is not going to accept the image that the [MISC Spanish  ] Republic is a banana republic . 
Ambassador [PER Argyros  ] noted [ORG USG  ] statements that the elections 3 days after the horrific terrorist attacks was a victory for [MISC Spanish  ] democracy. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Moratinos  ] and [PER Argyros  ] agreed on the importance of avoiding setting [MISC US-Spanish  ] relations through rhetoric and the need for private dialogue and meetings . 
Ambassador [PER Argyros  ] also suggested the importance of avoiding commentary or speculation on the [LOC US  ] elections by senior [ORG PSOE  ] leadership . 
[PER Moratinos  ] said that [ORG PSOE  ] , including [PER Zapatero  ] , understood this . 
He said that there would be no more commentary from [PER Zapatero  ] or the [ORG PSOE  ] on the [LOC US  ] elections. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) On [LOC Iraq  ] , [PER Moratinos  ] said that " if there is not a change in the role of the [ORG UN  ] " in [LOC Iraq  ] , we will pull out our troops . 
But , he asked the Ambassador to convey to the President and the Secretary that [MISC Spanish  ] commitment to a stable , democratic [LOC Iraq  ] remained unwavering , and that this would continue " with or without [MISC Spanish  ] troops . 
" [PER Moratinos  ] said [ORG PSOE  ] knows the [LOC U.S.  ] would prefer that the troops remain , but , he added , it is important to underscore that we share the same objective of a democratic , stable [LOC Iraq  ] . 
" Let 's talk together , " he said , about how we can achieve this objective . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] , he said , has a great role to play in this , and should . 
" We are not going to put our finger in your eye " on [LOC Iraq  ] , according to [PER Moratinos  ] . 
Again , he reiterated his desire to discuss how we can achieve our objectives in [LOC Iraq  ] " with or without " [MISC Spanish  ] troops. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Argyros  ] underscored our commitment to maintain strong [MISC US-Spanish  ] ties in [ORG NATO  ] . 
[PER Moratinos  ] said that " nothing will change at all " on [ORG NATO  ] issues , noting that the [ORG USG  ] and the previous [ORG PSOE  ] government had had excellent relations . 
[PER Moratinos  ] said that the new government was thinking of increasing [MISC Spanish  ] involvement in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , to help counter [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] there . 
He said [ORG PSOE  ] wanted to make clear that it would not appease [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] , and wanted to respond in way that [LOC Spain  ] could be most effective . 
He noted that the new government would have a commitment to the [MISC Spanish  ] people to react to the March 11 attacks . 
He indicated that increasing [LOC Spain  ] 's role in [LOC Afghanistan  ] would also show that the [ORG PSOE  ] government was not appeasing terrorists. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) On counter-terrorism , [PER Moratinos  ] said that [LOC Spain  ] , [LOC Europe  ] and the [LOC US  ] needed to work together to revisit their counter-terrorism strategy ( he would not call it a " war " because that would give legitimacy to the terrorists , he said ) , since the current strategy has not stemmed the tide of terrorism . 
[LOC Spain  ] might call for a dialogue between the [LOC US  ] and the [ORG EU  ] on terrorism , to have a fresh discussion of strategy , identify what has worked and what has failed. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Argyros  ] also underscored areas in which the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Spain  ] share common interests , such as [LOC Latin America  ] , where both [LOC Spain  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] have huge investments and an interest in stability and democracy . 
[PER Moratinos  ] agreed. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) On the [LOC Middle East  ] [PER Moratinos  ] mentioned the need to maintain the commitment to the Roadmap . 
He expressed deep concern , however , about the effect of the assassination just minutes before this meeting , by [MISC Israeli  ] forces of the [ORG Hamas  ] leader Sheikh [PER Ahmed Yassin  ] . 
[PER Moratinos  ] had to break briefly from the meeting to give a statement to the [MISC Spanish  ] press on the issue . 
He said that he considered this leader reprehensible , but was deeply concerned about the impact in the region of this " extra-judicial " killing ( see paragraph 14 for text of [ORG Moratinos'  ] March 22 statement on [ORG Hamas  ] killing ) . <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) At the close of the discussion , both the Ambassador and [PER Moratinos  ] agreed on the importance of building on the [MISC U.S.-Spanish  ] ties relationship and our shared commitment to the war on terrorism . 
Ambassador [PER Argyros  ] throughout the meeting underscored the [ORG USG  ] , s desire to work closely with the new government on issues of common concern , noting that , as among friends , there would be some issues on which we would have differences . 
Both also stressed the need to avoid developing our relationship through public rhetoric rather than private dialogue. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( U ) [ORG Moratinos'  ] statement on [ORG Hamas  ] killing , in interview on [MISC Spanish  ] national radio: " It puts the situation in the [LOC Middle East  ] and relations between [LOC Israel  ] and [LOC Palestine  ] back into a situation of a vicious circle of violence from which we are unable to emerge . 
Therefore I believe we all understand and we all share the state of [LOC Israel  ] 's security needs , but that cannot justify going outside the rule of law to fight terrorism when there are commitments to respect the rule of law , and that is what we have always said: these kinds of extrajudicial operations must be avoided and ended , because they only create greater cries for vengeance , greater unease and frustration among the [MISC Palestinian  ] population .
