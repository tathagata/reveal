( C ) SYG of the [ORG Nuba Forum  ] Nour Elanbia [PER Aburaida Shemaila  ] ( protect ) and local [LOC Cairo  ] leaders presented us with an announcement of the organization 's creation on February 2 . 
( [PER Note: Shemaila  ] is also a member of the [ORG SPLM National Secretariat  ] . 
End Note ) . 
[PER Shemaila  ] informed us that [ORG Nuba  ] representatives in [LOC Sudan  ] , [LOC Australia  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] , [LOC France  ] , [LOC Kenya  ] , [LOC Libya  ] , [LOC Norway  ] , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] and the [LOC United States  ] had decided to create the [ORG Forum  ] to protect and advocate for the rights of the [ORG Nuba  ] people . 
He said the [ORG Forum  ] 's agenda is based on the [ORG United Nations Declaration  ] on the Rights of [ORG Indigenous Peoples  ] . 
[PER Shemaila  ] said the [ORG Nuba Forum  ] has officially opened offices in [LOC Norway  ] , [LOC France  ] and [LOC Sweden  ] and plans to open offices in the near future in most of the aforementioned countries except [LOC Sudan  ] and possibly [LOC Egypt  ] , where [LOC Cairo  ] office Treasurer [PER Mojo Khalifa  ] ( protect ) worried about " security concerns . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG Cairo Office  ] Director of External Relations [PER Mubarak Manakaden  ] ( protect ) told us the [ORG Forum  ] 's goals are the recognition of the [ORG Nuba  ] identity , the right to preserve and teach the [ORG Nuba  ] language and culture , ensure that the [ORG Nuba  ] people have ownership of land and local resources and the right to self-determination , which are in danger under the [ORG NCP  ] regime . 
[PER Shemaila  ] said the model for the [ORG Nuba  ] movement would be to obtain similar rights as the [MISC Aborigines  ] have in present-day [LOC Australia.  ] ---------------------------- A Cautious Approach in [LOC Egypt  ] ---------------------------- [LOC CAIRO  ] 00000169 002 OF 002 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Khalifa  ] said the [LOC Cairo  ] office of the [ORG Nuba Forum  ] is working with the [ORG NGO Habitat International Coalition  ] to organize seminars to raise the awareness of the [ORG Nuba  ] people on their rights including land ownership and equality . 
However , [PER Shemaila  ] said the group has halted registration of new members in [LOC Egypt  ] and alleged that its website was hacked and leadership phone calls were monitored . 
[PER Khalifa  ] believes the GoE is concerned about the [ORG Nuba Forum  ] 's activities because it could " stimulate the [MISC Nubian  ] people in [LOC Egypt  ] to ask for similar indigenous rights " and the [ORG Forum  ] 's activities could create instability in the [ORG Nuba Mountain  ] region , which would threaten [MISC Egyptian  ] peacekeepers deployed to [LOC UNMIS.  ] --------------------------------------------- ------------- [ORG Forum  ] [PER Supports Arman  ] , Will [ORG Boycott Parliamentary Elections  ] --------------------------------------------- ------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Shemaila  ] stated that the [ORG Forum  ] supports the presidential candidacy of [MISC SPLM Parliamentary Head  ] [PER Yasir Arman  ] as " the last chance for unity . 
" However , he said the [ORG Nuba Forum  ] will boycott the parliamentary elections because a complete census did not take place among the [ORG Nuba  ] people and the resulting distribution of parliamentary seats would not reflect the influence of the [ORG Nuba  ] population of [MISC South Kordofan  ] . 
According to [LOC Cairo  ] office Information Spokesman [PER Mohamed Gom'a Suliman  ] ( protect ) , the [ORG Nuba  ] will only receive 2 of 10 parliamentary seats allotted to [MISC South Kordofan  ] , but comprise approximately 60-70 percent of the population .

( C ) Despite fighting on the side of the [ORG SPLM  ] in the last civil war , [PER Shemaila  ] told us that the [ORG Nuba  ] people have historical ties to northern [LOC Sudan  ] . 
He stated that because of this , the [ORG Forum  ] supports a united [LOC Sudan  ] with a decentralized , confederal system of governance that would grant the [ORG Nuba  ] autonomy over the [ORG Nuba Mountains  ] region . 
However , he told us that if the [LOC South  ] secedes , the [ORG Nuba Forum  ] will advocate for its right to self-determination , in which the [ORG Nuba  ] people should decide whether to be independent , part of the [LOC North  ] , or part of [LOC South Sudan  ] . 
He stated that the denial of [ORG Nuba  ] self-determination would create " another [LOC Darfur  ] . 
" [PER Shemaila  ] said the [ORG Nuba  ] have " 25,000-soldier army " at [LOC Al  ] Abayad dedicated to protecting [ORG Nuba  ] rights. --------------------------------------- [ORG S/E Gration Should Visit Nuba Mountains  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Shemaila  ] contended that the [ORG Nuba Mountain  ] region has been ignored by the [ORG USG  ] . 
He encouraged [ORG S/E Gration  ] to come to the region and meet with [ORG Nuba  ] leaders .
