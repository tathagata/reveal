She said there were rumors that he was instructed to do this by a senior [ORG USG  ] official . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] said that to his knowledge this was not the case , noting that [PER Tsvangirai  ] “walked” without any consultation and seemingly without a [LOC PRETORIA  ] 00002245 003 OF 003 plan .

) [PER Mashabane  ] said the [ORG SAG  ] view was that [PER Mugabe  ] is getting desperate and is trying to push the country into elections . 
On the other hand , she said [PER Tsvangirai  ] wasn’t realistic in calling for removal of all the security chiefs . 
She advocated seeking to change the electoral law to facilitate proper counting , while pragmatically leaving the security chiefs in place . 
[PER Mashabane  ] broached consideration for amnesty scenarios for the security chiefs that might induce them not to block a political transition. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Mashabane  ] promised to follow-up with the [ORG Ambassador  ] on next steps following discussions she would have very soon with President [PER Zuma  ] and the Foreign Minister of [LOC Mozambique  ] . 
She advocated helping [PER Tsvangirai  ] prepare for elections if they happen and exposing the dirty actions of the security chiefs .

( C ) [MISC COMMENT:  ] The [MISC Ambassador’s  ] first official meeting with the [MISC South African  ] Foreign Minister was particularly friendly and open , emblematic of the positive trend in our bilateral relationship . 
The Foreign Minister indicated a desire to set up a dinner to welcome the [ORG Ambassador  ] , as long as we did not tell the other Ambassadors . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] met her last August ( prior to presenting his credentials ) while accompanying Secretary [PER Clinton  ] on her visit to [LOC South Africa  ] , when the two Ministers established a warm rapport . 
There is clearly enthusiasm within the [ORG SAG  ] for developing a bilateral mechanism . 
We should bear in mind , however that the [MISC South African  ] Government faces shortfalls in capacity which limit its ability to staff cooperative mechanisms and to implement programs , so we will have to carefully choose our initiatives . 
The Foreign Minister made strong statements on [LOC Zimbabwe  ] and [PER Robert Mugabe  ] , but our sense is that her department does not have the lead within the [ORG SAG  ] on the [LOC Zimbabwe  ] agenda .
