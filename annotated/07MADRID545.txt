[ORG MADRID  ] 538 [ORG MADRID  ] 00000545 001.2 OF 003 Classified By: [ORG DCM  ] [PER Hugo Llorens  ] , reasons 1.4 ( B ) and ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary . 
[ORG MFA Director General  ] for [ORG Iberoamerica Javier  ] [PER Sandomingo  ] informed [ORG DCM  ] on March 23 that [MISC Spanish  ] Foreign Minister [PER Miguel Angel Moratinos  ] plans to visit [LOC Cuba  ] , though no date has been fixed . 
[PER Sandomingo  ] ( strictly protect ) shared this with the [ORG DCM  ] during a readout of the March 17 visit to [ORG Madrid  ] of [MISC Cuban  ] FM [PER Felipe Perez Roque  ] , making clear that [ORG Moratinos  ] himself was the strongest proponent of a high level [MISC Spanish  ] visit to [LOC Cuba  ] and that others in the media " and in the [ORG Zapatero Government  ] " opposed such a visit . 
He said that [ORG MFA  ] Secretary of State for [ORG Iberoamerica Trinidad Jimenez  ] , who was on travel with the Royal family , had asked [PER Sandomingo  ] to brief the [ORG DCM  ] on Moratinos' intention to visit [LOC Cuba  ] , per her agreement to keep the [ORG USG  ] informed ( [ORG REF  ] A ) . 
[PER Sandomingo  ] assessed that a [ORG Moratinos  ] visit could help advance [MISC Spanish  ] objectives in [LOC Cuba  ] , including increased dialogue with potential post-Castro leaders , [MISC Cuban  ] agreement to allow the resumption of [LOC Spain  ] 's development aid to [LOC Cuba  ] , and the reopening of the [ORG Spanish Cultural Center  ] in [LOC Havana  ] that was shut down by [PER Castro  ] in 2003. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The [ORG DCM  ] asked whether [MISC Spanish  ] officials saw any real signs of change in [MISC Cuban  ] Government policy that would warrant such optimism or the symbolism of a high level [MISC Spanish  ] visit , noting the [MISC Cuban  ] [ORG Government  ] 's continued strong repression of dissidents . 
[PER Sandomingo  ] acknowledged that he did not see much evidence of substantial policy shifts in [LOC Cuba  ] , but allowed that such changes might be taking place . 
He reviewed overall [MISC Spanish  ] objectives in [LOC Cuba  ] , saying the fundamental objective was to get the [MISC Cuban  ] [ORG Government  ] " to leave its people alone and let them lead normal lives . 
" The [ORG DCM  ] asked that the [ORG USG  ] be informed immediately if a date was set for a [ORG Moratinos  ] visit , noting that any surprises would be badly received by the [ORG USG  ] since we had tried in good faith to coordinate [LOC Cuba  ] policy with [LOC Spain  ] . 
[PER Sandomingo  ] said that [LOC Trinidad Jimenez  ] had emphasized with [ORG Moratinos  ] the need to advise partners prior to making news of such a visit available to the press . 
Post 's assessment is that [ORG Moratinos  ] is indeed the driving force behind [MISC Spanish  ] plans to visit [LOC Havana  ] . 
The [ORG Zapatero Government  ] 's desire to firm up its left wing in the runup to key May 27 regional/municipal elections may be one factor in Moratinos' plans to go to [LOC Cuba  ] , but his rivalry with [PER Jimenez  ] and his conviction that he can affect change in [LOC Cuba  ] through good relations with [PER Perez Roque  ] may be more important considerations . 
The fact that this visit does not have unanimous support virtually guarantees that internal differences on this policy will be aired in the [MISC Spanish  ] media . 
End Summary. //PEREZ [PER ROQUE  ] VISIT// <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [ORG DCM  ] requested the meeting with [PER Sandomingo  ] to review the March 17 visit of [MISC Cuban  ] FM [PER Perez Roque  ] ( [ORG REF  ] B ) . 
[PER Sandomingo  ] provided a brief readout , saying [PER Perez Roque  ] had mostly reviewed long-standing [MISC Cuban  ] grievances , such as the [ORG EU Common Position  ] , the existence of the 2003 [ORG EU  ] Restrictive Measures on [LOC Cuba  ] ( suspended at [LOC Spain  ] 's behest in 2004 ) , and the continuing elaboration of an [ORG EU  ] strategic document regarding [LOC Cuba  ] . 
[PER Sandomingo  ] discussed [LOC Spain  ] 's views on each of these issues , saying that the [ORG Common Position  ] was not particularly effective , but it was the best available tool in the absence of [ORG EU  ] consensus on how to deal with [LOC Cuba  ] . 
He said that [LOC Spain  ] had " nothing against " the development of a strategic document on [LOC Cuba  ] at the [ORG EU  ] level , but that the drafts shared by other [ORG EU  ] members contained language that would guarantee a break in [MISC Cuban-EU  ] relations . 
[PER Sandomingo  ] asserted that maintaining a principled stand on the need for democracy in [LOC Cuba  ] was a key element of [MISC Spanish  ] policy , but so was [LOC Spain  ] 's determination to keep open its channels to the [MISC Cuban  ] leadership . 
The [ORG DCM  ] noted that President [ORG Zapatero  ] himself had recently publicly declared his preference for a democratic [LOC Cuba  ] and suggested that further statements by [MISC Spanish  ] officials along these lines would be very helpful in sending the right message to the [MISC Cuban  ] leadership. //MORATINOS WANTS TO GO TO CUBA// <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Ending his review of [PER Perez Roque  ] 's visit , [PER Sandoming  ] said that , at [LOC Trinidad Jimenez  ] 's request , he wanted the [ORG DCM  ] to know that the [ORG MFA  ] was working to lay the groundwork for a [ORG MADRID  ] 00000545 002.2 OF 003 [ORG Moratinos  ] visit to [LOC Havana  ] and that he ( [PER Sandomingo  ] ) would be going to [LOC Cuba  ] on March 25 to establish the parameters for such a visit . 
[PER Sandomingo  ] said that he would not be going to [LOC Havana  ] with proposed dates , but said that it was Moratinos' intention to visit [LOC Cuba  ] . 
( NOTE: The conservative [MISC Spanish  ] daily " [ORG ABC  ] " reported March 23 that [ORG Moratinos  ] planned to visit [LOC Cuba  ] during the second half of April , despite mixed signals from [PER Jimenez  ] as to whether this trip was on the agenda . 
END NOTE ) . 
[PER Sandomingo  ] pointed to the controversial nature of this planned visit and said that he expected strong criticism of a [ORG Moratinos  ] visit not only from the opposition [ORG Popular Party  ] , but also from [MISC Spanish  ] " media generally sympathetic to the [ORG Zapatero Government  ] and from members of [ORG Zapatero  ] 's [ORG Government  ] itself . 
" However , he dismissed as irrelevant the media speculation surrounding contradictory public statements by [PER Trinidad Jimenez  ] this week regarding [LOC Cuba  ] , telling the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG Senate  ] on March 19 of [ORG MFA  ] plans to visit [LOC Cuba  ] , then telling a Parliamentary committee on March 21 that there were " no plans to visit [LOC Cuba  ] . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Sandomingo  ] said that the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG Government  ] saw [LOC Cuba  ] as being in the initial phase of a period of change , though [PER Fidel Castro  ] 's reemergence might delay progress for the time being . 
He said that [LOC Spain  ] 's primary objective at the moment was to promote stability in [LOC Cuba  ] and to put itself in a position to influence the orientation of the post-Fidel [MISC Cuban  ] leadership . 
He suggested ( without much enthusiasm ) that a [ORG Moratinos  ] visit could advance specific [MISC Spanish  ] objectives in [LOC Cuba  ] , including: -- [MISC Cuban  ] agreement to allow resumption of [MISC Spanish  ] development programs in [LOC Cuba  ] , unilaterally suspended by [LOC Cuba  ] in 2003 . 
[PER Sandomingo  ] said that , ideally , [LOC Spain  ] could convince [LOC Havana  ] to allow the resumption of all [ORG EU  ] aid , but that the resumption of [MISC Spanish  ] aid alone would represent a victory . 
He said that [MISC Spanish  ] aid was aimed at fomenting the growth of [MISC Cuban  ] civil society . 
-- [MISC Cuban  ] agreement to reopen the [ORG Spanish Cultural Center  ] in [LOC Havana  ] shuttered by the [MISC Cuban  ] authorities in 2003 . 
[PER Sandomingo  ] said that he had opened the [ORG Cultural Center  ] during his stint as charge d'affaires in [LOC Havana  ] and that the first session had been a discussion of [LOC Spain  ] 's political transition ( much to the annoyance of [MISC Cuban  ] Government officials ) . 
He said that the [ORG Cultural Center  ] had served as one of the few channels of uncensored information to the [MISC Cuban  ] people and as a " free space " for [MISC Cuban  ] intellectuals and other citizens . 
-- Launching discussions on [LOC Cuba  ] 's need to repay outstanding official short-term debt to [LOC Spain  ] ( [ORG REF  ] C ) . 
[PER Sandomingo  ] assigned much lower priority to this objective , saying the political objectives were at the forefront of [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG MFA  ] efforts. //FEW SIGNS OF CHANGE// <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [ORG DCM  ] asked whether [ORG Moratinos  ] decision was final . 
[PER Sandomingo  ] said that the decision would not be finalized until dates for a visit had been fixed , but that he was certain that [ORG Moratinos  ] wanted to go to [LOC Cuba  ] . 
The [ORG DCM  ] asked whether [LOC Spain  ] saw any signs of positive change in [LOC Cuba  ] that would warrant such a high level visit , noting that the regime continued to crack down on dissidents . 
[PER Sandomingo  ] acknowledged that he had not seen anything more than minor , unspecified indicators of a desire for change by [MISC Cuban  ] officials . 
However , he allowed that change might be underway and that this could justify a [ORG Moratinos  ] visit . 
[PER Sandomingo  ] reviewed [LOC Spain  ] 's objectives in [LOC Cuba  ] , which he broadly defined as convincing the [MISC Cuban  ] leadership to " leave its people alone and let them lead normal lives . 
" He said that , unfortunately , [LOC Cuba  ] 's repressive apparatus had eliminated internal political pressure as a factor , but said that the poor socio-economic conditions experienced by the [MISC Cuban  ] people represented a significant factor that did have to be taken into account by the [MISC Cuban  ] Government . 
[LOC Spain  ] 's assessment is that some in the [MISC Cuban  ] leadership , including around [PER Raul Castro  ] , agree with the need to cease harrassing the population and are open to reform . 
[PER Sandomingo  ] argued that it was important to encourage [LOC Cuba  ] 's post-Castro leaders , to make them feel less fearful of change and therefore more willing to accept a shift in the status quo. //KEEPING [ORG USG  ] INFORMED// <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [ORG DCM  ] underscored the importance of [LOC Spain  ] [ORG MADRID  ] 00000545 003.2 OF 003 maintaining close consulations and a dialogue with the [ORG USG  ] on [LOC Cuba  ] and asked that the [ORG MFA  ] advise the [ORG USG  ] immediately if [ORG Moratinos  ] confirmed his plans to travel to [LOC Cuba  ] . 
The [ORG DCM  ] reiterated [PER A/S Shannon  ] 's request that [LOC Spain  ] " not leave the [ORG USG  ] alone " on [LOC Cuba  ] and coordinate with us as much as possible , given our joint interest in a democratic [LOC Cuba  ] . 
He laid down a marker , cautioning [PER Sandomingo  ] that any surprise announcement of a [ORG Moratinos  ] visit to [LOC Havana  ] would be badly received in [LOC Washington  ] , particularly in light the [ORG USG  ] 's good faith effort to coordinate with [LOC Spain  ] on [LOC Cuba  ] policy . 
The [ORG DCM  ] regretted that he had had to wait five days for a readout of the FM [PER Perez Roque  ] visit after having first requested such a meeting on March 19 . 
[PER Sandomingo  ] said he fully agreed on the need for good communication and noted that [PER Trinidad Jimenez  ] had emphasized to [ORG Moratinos  ] the need to brief key partners ( meaning the [ORG USG  ] ) before announcing to the media any specific plans by him to visit [LOC Havana  ] . 
On the issue of discussions with the [ORG USG  ] , [PER Sandomingo  ] said that [PER Trinidad Jimenez  ] would likely be forced to postpone plans for an April visit to [LOC Washington  ] and that May presented a better opportunity . 
[PER Sandomingo  ] confirmed that both he and [PER Jimenez  ] would be in [LOC Madrid  ] for the May 17-18 conference organized by the [ORG Inter American Dialogue.  ] //COMMENT// <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) While disappointing , [ORG Moratinos'  ] planned visit to [LOC Cuba  ] does not come a shock , given media reporting over the last few months of a possible visit . 
Post 's assessment is that [ORG Moratinos  ] is indeed the driving force behind [MISC Spanish  ] plans to visit [LOC Havana  ] . 
The [ORG Zapatero Government  ] 's desire to firm up its left wing in the runup to key May 27 regional/municipal elections may be one factor in [ORG Moratinos'  ] plans to go to [LOC Cuba  ] , but his rivalry with [PER Jimenez  ] and his conviction that he can affect change in [LOC Cuba  ] through good relations with [PER Perez Roque  ] may be more important considerations . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] Government is well aware of [ORG USG  ] sensitivities on this issue ( see [ORG REF  ] A ) . 
The depth of internal differences within the [ORG Zapatero Government  ] is somewhat surprising and reflects the varied expertise of those involved . 
[ORG Moratinos  ] has little experience on [LOC Cuba  ] and appears optimistic regarding his ability to change [MISC Cuban  ] leadership behavior . 
By contrast , [PER Trinidad Jimenez  ] , [PER Javier Sandomingo  ] , and [ORG MFA  ] DG for Foreign Policy [PER Rafael Dezcallar  ] have worked on [LOC Cuba  ] for many years and are more skeptical of the [MISC Cuban  ] leadership in general , and of [LOC Spain  ] 's capacity to change their behavior . 
In any case , the fact that this visit does not have unanimous GOS support virtually guarantees that internal differences on this policy will be aired in the [MISC Spanish  ] media [MISC Aguirre</pre></code>  ]
