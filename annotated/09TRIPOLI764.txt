[ORG NATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BOARD: HELPING LIBYA  ] TO " CATCH UP " .. . 
2 . 
( C ) On September 16 , P/E Counselor and Econoff met with Said [PER Hoderi  ] , Director of [ORG International Cooperation  ] at the [ORG National Economic Development Board  ] ( [ORG NEDB  ] ) ; [PER Faouzi Saleh Elmozogi  ] , Director of [ORG Human Institutional Capacity Development  ] at [ORG NEDB  ] ; and Dr. [PER Fathi Ibrahim  ] , Training Manager of the [ORG Small and Medium Enterprise Department  ] at [ORG NEDB  ] to discuss the [ORG NEDB  ] 's work to develop a strategic plan for [LOC Libya  ] 's economic development . 
[PER Hoderi  ] , who has been working at the [ORG NEDB  ] since its inception , explained that the [ORG NEDB  ] was created in 2007 by the General People 's Committee ( [ORG GPC  ] ) - equivalent of Prime Minister 's cabinet - to implement the recommendations of a report authored by the [ORG Monitor Group  ] analyzing [LOC Libya  ] 's development needs . 
The report - the result of an initiative spear-headed by [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi - recommended that [LOC Libya  ] diversify its economy beyond the hydrocarbons sector and move towards a market-based economy . 
3 . 
( C ) [PER Elmozogi  ] described the [ORG NEDB  ] as a technical advisory arm that answers directly to Prime Minister al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi ; as such , it can cut through the [MISC Libyan  ] bureaucracy to implement programs more efficiently than other government agencies . 
Recognizing that [LOC Libya  ] 's development stagnated over the past 20 years , [PER Hoderi  ] emphasized that [LOC Libya  ] must " speed up " its development spending . 
The [ORG NEDB  ] is at the forefront of [LOC Libya  ] 's efforts to move from a centrally-planned economy to one in which the private sector would be the driving force ( [ORG Ref  ] A ) . ...THROUGH CREATION OF A [MISC STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 4  ] . 
( C ) One of the [ORG NEDB  ] 's most ambitious programs entails creating a system to monitor and evaluate the [ORG Libyan National Development Program  ] , which encompasses more than 11,000 projects . 
Through the [MISC Strategic Management  ] of the [ORG Development Program  ] ( [ORG SMDP  ] ) , the [ORG NEDB  ] is developing an integrated macro-management system , with the assistance of [ORG Ernst and Young  ] and the [ORG UN Development Program  ] , to enable the [MISC Libyan  ] government to mitigate the potential negative effects of accelerated spending on the economy . 
The system will also assist with contingency planning by running various scenarios , such as fluctuations in the price of oil , the main source of [LOC Libya  ] 's revenue . 
The new system would act as a " dashboard " for policy-makers and indicate which projects should be sped up and which could be slowed down . 
[PER Hoderi  ] admitted that the first report of the new system was supposed to be completed by July 2009 , but the [ORG NEDB  ] was not completely satisfied with the product delivered by [ORG Ernst and Young  ] . 
He said he was not aware that another such program existed ; therefore , developing a strategic national economic plan specific to [LOC Libya  ] 's unique development needs had been challenging . 
DEVELOPING THE PUBLIC SECTOR , INCLUDING DIPLOMATS 5 . 
( C ) In addition to developing a strategic plan for managing [LOC Libya  ] 's economic resources , [PER Hoderi  ] described the [ORG NEDB  ] 's leadership in improving professional training and education in [LOC Libya  ] . 
[PER Hoderi  ] explained that the [ORG NEDB  ] 's work in this sector began at the most basic level - through primary education reform . 
He said that the [ORG NEDB  ] was working with experts from [LOC Singapore  ] to design a new program for managing the primary [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000764 002.2 OF 003 education system and to incorporate a [MISC Singaporean  ] model for education reform . 
Beyond primary education , [PER Elmozogi  ] described several [ORG NEDB  ] efforts to improve the quality of professional training in [LOC Libya  ] , particularly for public sector employees , including " future leaders , " diplomats , judges , and local and municipal government officials . 
In the first program , the [ORG NEDB  ] is cooperating with the [LOC UK  ] government and the [ORG London School of Economics  ] ( [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi 's alma mater ) , among other [LOC UK  ] institutions , on an exchange program to send 400 " future leaders " of [LOC Libya  ] for leadership and management training . 
Eventually , [PER Elmozogi  ] explained , 250 additional [MISC Libyan  ] " future leaders " would also be trained in [LOC Libya  ] . 
Likewise , the [ORG NEDB  ] is working with universities in the [LOC United States  ] ( [ORG Michigan State  ] and elsewhere ) , the [LOC UK  ] , and [LOC France  ] to manage exchange programs for 90 young [MISC Libyan  ] diplomats ( 30 [MISC Libyan  ] diplomats are currently being trained in each country ) . 
[PER Hoderi  ] responded positively to [LOC Emboffs'  ] suggestions that [MISC Libyan  ] diplomats in the [LOC United States  ] coordinate a site visit to the [ORG National Foreign Affairs Training Center  ] . 
[PER Elmozogi  ] said that the [ORG NEDB  ] had also sent 70 [MISC Libyan  ] judges to the [LOC UK  ] to study [MISC English  ] language and international law . 
Finally , [PER Hoderi  ] emphasized the [ORG NEDB  ] 's interest in working with the embassy to design a training and exchange program for members of [LOC Libya  ] 's local and municipal governments . 
" I believe [MISC Libyans  ] would benefit from seeing how your small towns are run , even if our government system is very different from yours in the [LOC United States  ] , " he observed . 
6 . 
( C ) As a corollary to training local government officials , [PER Hoderi  ] expressed an interest in studying how [LOC U.S.  ] local governments incorporate small businesses into community development plans . 
He explained that as [LOC Libya  ] moves from a public sector-dominated economy to one that is more decentralized , local governments ( " shabiyas " in the [MISC Libyan  ] system ) will need to take responsibility for encouraging small businesses and spurring private sector growth . 
[ Note: This may be an opportunity for a specialized [ORG International Visitors Program  ] . 
End note . 
] [PER Hoderi  ] also asked if [MISC American  ] experts could conduct training of trainer workshops in [LOC Libya  ] for the public sector on leadership and management skills , including teamwork and communications . 
The [ORG NEDB  ] has already trained 1,000 local government employees in these topics in [LOC Tripoli  ] and would like to expand the program to other cities throughout the country . 
REQUEST FOR [LOC U.S.  ] ASSISTANCE WITH DEVELOPING SMALL- AND [ORG MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES  ] 7 . 
( C ) According to [PER Fathi Ibrahim  ] , the [ORG NEDB  ] 's Small- and [ORG Medium-sized Enterprise  ] ( [ORG SME  ] ) program aims to nurture small- and medium-sized businesses by providing advice on business plan formulation , loan guarantees , and access to technology . 
Whereas SMEs comprise more than 90 percent of economic production worldwide , [PER Hoderi  ] explained that they play only a minor role in [LOC Libya  ] 's formal economy . 
By creating " business incubators " that will assist new entrepreneurs , the [ORG NEDB  ] hopes to facilitate the growth of SMEs and create new job opportunities , especially in tourism , trade , fishing , [ORG Information Technology  ] , construction , and oil services . 
[PER Ibrahim  ] explained that the [ORG NEDB  ] had already opened incubators in [LOC Tripoli  ] , [LOC Benghazi  ] , and [LOC Sebha  ] . 
He said that the [ORG NEDB  ] plans to open specialized incubators in bio-agriculture , [ORG Information Technology  ] , and for the physically challenged . 
[PER Ibrahim  ] requested embassy assistance in designing a program to send 10 to 15 managers of business incubators to the [LOC U.S.  ] for training for 4-6 weeks at similar [LOC U.S.  ] institutions . 
[PER Ibrahim  ] envisions a hands-on training program covering all aspects of management , including marketing services , setting budgets , and managing staff . 
[PER Hoderi  ] said that the [ORG NEDB  ] was also considering sending the managers to [LOC Singapore  ] for such a training program . 
In addition to training managers , the [ORG NEDB  ] plans to train entrepreneurs from throughout [LOC Libya  ] on all aspects of starting up a business - topics would include conducting feasibility studies , developing business plans , securing financing , and developing/managing budgets . 
The [ORG NEDB  ] would like to conduct the training in [LOC Libya  ] ( starting in 2010 ) and then conduct a session in the [LOC United States  ] . 
AND RENEWED INTEREST IN THE [ORG COMMERCIAL LAW DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM  ] 8 . 
( [LOC SBU  ] ) In response to Econoff 's inquiry regarding [ORG NEDB  ] interest in working with the [ORG U.S. Department of Commerce  ] 's [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000764 003.2 OF 003 [ORG Commercial Law Development Program  ] ( [ORG CLDP  ] ) , [PER Hoderi  ] and his colleagues confirmed that they wanted to resurrect the study tour idea ( Refs B , C ) . 
[PER Hoderi  ] agreed to re-establish email communications with [ORG CLDP  ] on the latter 's recommendations of early 2009 for a study tour of [LOC U.S.  ] business incubators . 
COMMENT: [MISC LIBYANS  ] SEEM VERY RECEPTIVE BUT PROOF WILL BE IN THE PUDDING 9 . 
( C ) Comment: During this latest meeting with the [ORG NEDB  ] , the staff was more welcoming and open to working with the [LOC U.S.  ] than in the past . 
The discussion broadened areas of possible cooperation to include training of [ORG NEDB  ] staff , entrepreneurs , public sector employees , and local government leaders . 
If successful , such cooperation offers the opportunity to influence [LOC Libya  ] 's reform efforts at local , grassroots levels . 
However , past experience indicates that program implementation could be difficult . 
We will follow up with the [ORG Commercial Law Development Program  ] and relevant Department offices to explore the possibilities of designing the programs outlined above .
