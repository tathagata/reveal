( C ) [ORG Abd  ] al-Mahdi commented that [MISC Iraqi  ] relations with [LOC Iran  ] are at a low point , noting that what the [MISC Iranians  ] did in [LOC Fakkah  ] was a mistake . 
( Ref A ) He said that both countries acknowledge that the [LOC Fakkah  ] oil well is in a disputed area , because of the unclear border between [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] , but he believed the situation was returning to normal as evidenced by the [MISC Iranians  ] removing their flag from the field .

( C ) [PER Talabani  ] commented that the 1975 [MISC Algiers Agreement  ] ( on border delineation ) is the root of many problems surrounding the [MISC Iran-Iraq  ] border . 
The President commented that in some places the [MISC Iranians  ] are moving toward the border because of what they see as laid out in the 1975 [MISC Agreement  ] , but said Qwhat they see as laid out in the 1975 [MISC Agreement  ] , but said that the [MISC Iraqis  ] do not recognize the agreement because it was formalized under the [PER Saddam  ] regime. --------------------------------------------- TALABANI: [LOC U.S.  ] SHOULD BE MINDFUL OF IMPACT OF SUPPORTING [LOC IRAN  ] OPPOSITION --------------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) When asked about the ongoing demonstrations in [LOC Iran  ] and whether such events pose a real threat to the [MISC Iranian  ] regime , [PER Talabani  ] said that the current demonstrations are very serious and represent the division among the political leaders and religious authorities trickling down to the street level . 
The President commented that [LOC Iran  ] has a diverse population , with differences among all groups running deep with a long history .

( C ) With regard to any possible show of [LOC U.S.  ] support to the [MISC Iranian  ] people , [PER Talabani  ] cautioned that the [LOC U.S.  ] must consider how the [MISC Iranian  ] regime could use a show of [LOC U.S.  ] solidarity toward the [MISC Iranian  ] opposition to further label the opposition as agents of the [LOC U.S.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Referring to his conversations with [MISC Syrian  ] President [PER Bashar al-Asad  ] , [PER Talabani  ] said that the [MISC Syrians  ] deny suicide bombers enter [LOC Iraq  ] via [LOC Syria  ] and say they support [MISC Iraqi  ] unity and security . 
[PER Talabani  ] opined that certain parts of the [MISC Syrian  ] regime were supportive of such terrorists . 
[PER Talabani  ] also commented that none of [LOC Iraq  ] , s neighbors are happy about [LOC Iraq  ] 's success and do not want a strong , united [LOC Iraq  ] , as they fear [LOC Iraq  ] as a model of democracy in the region and [LOC Iraq  ] , s ability to assume its share of the oil market .

The Vice President believed that holding a successful national election would help to further stabilize the [MISC Iraqi  ] political system . 
He hoped that participation in the election would be as high as that of previous elections , but acknowledged that turnout could be somewhat less . 
[ORG Abd  ] al-Mahdi commented that the four-month delay in forming a government following the previous national election was damaging to [LOC Iraq  ] and sent the wrong message to [LOC Iraq  ] 's enemies .

The Vice President also commented that campaigning will utilize both radio and television , and that during this campaign season there would also be several debates . 
[ORG Abd  ] al-Mahdi noted that elections in 2010 will differ from the previous national elections , in that the [MISC Iraqi  ] people will vote for individuals as opposed to lists , which he believed was a positive change and would result in less polarization .

( C ) When asked , [ORG Abd  ] al-Mahdi acknowledged that he is a contender for the prime ministership , but noted that as is the case in all elections , the election outcome and alliances formed would ultimately determine the next prime minister .

( C ) President [PER Talabani  ] when queried as to his election predictions said that he believed the winning bloc would either be [MISC Maliki  ] 's [ORG State of Law  ] or the [ORG Iraqi National Alliance  ] ( [ORG INA  ] ) , with [ORG Allawi  ] 's list coming third . 
Regarding the [MISC Kurdish  ] bloc , [PER Talabani  ] said that the [ORG PUK  ] and [ORG KDP  ] lists will be united , but that all [MISC Kurdish  ] parties will be working to advance themselves .

( C ) In response to an inquiry into concerns surrounding the [LOC U.S.  ] withdrawal and the readiness of the [MISC Iraqi  ] Army ( [LOC IA  ] ) to fill that void , [ORG Abd  ] al-Mahdi said that there are less fears of this prospect than there were two years ago . 
The Vice President acknowledged that there are good signs of development in the [LOC IA  ] , but said he thought all parties overestimated progress made and said he would qualify the current situation in [LOC Iraq  ] differently than some of his colleagues would . 
He said that two months ago others within the [ORG GOI  ] believed [ORG Al-Qa'ida  ] was finished and argued for the removal of [MISC T-walls  ] , but that he believed [ORG Al-Qa'ida  ] was not finished , but rather would spread if left to its own devices . 
[ORG Abd  ] al-Mahdi believes the [ORG GOI  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] government must reassess the current security situation in [LOC Iraq  ] and the next [MISC Iraqi  ] government and the [LOC U.S.  ] should revise the security agreement accordingly , especially in light of recent attacks targeting government buildings in the center of [LOC Baghdad.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 .
