( C ) The announcement by [LOC Iceland  ] 's [ORG Central Bank  ] on October 7 that [LOC Russia  ] would provide a USD 5.4 billion loan created an international stir , unleashing a wave of speculation as to who had approached [LOC Russia  ] , why and when the contact was made , and what the [MISC Russians  ] could be contemplating as the quid pro quo . 
The who and when questions seemed to have been put to rest by Prime Minister [PER Geir Haarde  ] 's comment last week that he had discussed assistance with the [MISC Russians  ] in August " on his own initiative . 
" As for the quid , everything from landing , refueling , maintenance or other rights at the former [LOC U.S.  ] base at [LOC Keflavik  ] , to advantageous exploration and exploitation rights in potential gas and petroleum fields under [MISC Icelandic  ] waters , has been suggested. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Following the announcement , a team of [ORG Central Bank  ] and other financial experts traveled to [LOC Moscow  ] October 14-15 for talks . 
They did not return with a deal , but did hold open the possibility of further talks . 
Although we have been told there have been telephone and e-mail contacts , there have been no subsequent meetings . 
In the meantime , [MISC Russian  ] government comments to the press have been getting progressively bleaker , hinting at doubts concerning [LOC Iceland  ] 's creditworthiness . 
There has also been casual talk that [LOC Iceland  ] 's failure to gain a [ORG UN Security Council  ] seat last month may have lessened [MISC Russian  ] interest . 
International press stories outlining [LOC Russia  ] 's own financial difficulties appear to have significantly dampened expectations here . 
As more time passes without a successful deal , [LOC Russia  ] 's motives have been questioned , including suggestions that [LOC Moscow  ] was never serious about the loan and offered it only as a public tions stunt to boost [LOC Russia  ] 's image and discomfit the [LOC West  ] . 
( If so , this tactic has not worked all that well: [MISC Icelandic  ] polls taken in October 2006 and October 2008 show the same 39 percent of the population favorably disposed towards [LOC Russia  ] , though the negatives in 2008 are slightly higher . 
) Although the [MISC Icelandic  ] government asserts in public that the deal is still on the table and bilateral discussions will continue , in private , high-ranking sources in the [ORG MFA  ] and the Prime Minister 's office tell us that the deal is on the back burner and they want it to stay there . 
[LOC Iceland  ] has no interest in a bilateral financial arrangement with [LOC Russia  ] except as a last life-saving effort should friends and allies fail to come through with credit . 
[MISC Icelandic  ] leaders hope that any such loan would be included as part of the [ORG IMF  ] bail-out , with [LOC Russia  ] only one of a consortium of lender countries . 
If it is a separate bilateral deal , however , the government has also repeatedly assured us and the public that the loan would be a purely financial transaction , with no foreign policy implications . 
Few we have talked to believe that [LOC Russia  ] would actually be so altruistic. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) There has been no lack of theories and entertaining " informed " comment as to why the [MISC Russians  ] would be willing to offer financial assistance for the first time to a [ORG NATO  ] country . 
Much of the speculation we have heard features one or all of the following: corrupt [MISC Russian  ] oligarchs , Prime Minister [PER Putin  ] , shady bank dealings , money laundering , and secret accounts in the now-failed [MISC Icelandic  ] banks . 
One well-placed observer points to a purported close friendship between [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador [PER Victor Tatarintsev  ] and PM [PER Putin  ] that supposedly inclined the Prime Minister to be generous to [LOC Iceland  ] ; other commentators suggest secret illicit connections between various oligarchs and the now defunct [MISC Icelandic  ] banks or their [MISC European  ] branches and subsidiaries . 
A story that circulated among the international press camped out in [LOC Reykjavik  ] two weeks ago claimed that the [MISC Russian  ] leadership offered the loan to recover [MISC Russian  ] state property that had been illegally put up as collateral for a loan that a company closely tied to [PER Putin  ] had obtained from [LOC Iceland  ] 's Kaupthing Bank. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The matter remains a puzzle , and post can't claim to have a firm fix on any part of it . 
The [ORG MFA Permanent Secretary  ] told the Ambassador the [ORG MFA  ] had no knowledge of any bilateral loan discussions before the [ORG Central Bank  ] announcement . 
A senior [ORG MFA  ] source blamed the whole business on [ORG Central Bank  ] shenanigans , asserting that the Prime Minister did not know of the contacts between the central banks until very recently . 
Yet another senior official told us that the loan offer started off as something quite different: when an [MISC Icelandic  ] citizen owner of a small bank in [LOC St. Petersburg  ] complained of problems with currency transactions , the [MISC Russian  ] [ORG Central Bank  ] proposed to the [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG Central Bank  ] that the two institutions discuss some sort of cooperation , presumably a currency swap . 
At some point this summer , the Prime Minister was made aware of and became involved in the budding deal . 
How the currency swap became a huge loan offer is left unclear . 
What does seem certain , though , is that the [ORG Central Bank  ] 's announcement of the loan offer came as a surprise to many , including members of the Prime Minister 's office and the Foreign Minister 's inner circle . 
[ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000256 002 OF 002 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Of all the government representatives who have discussed the loan in public , [ORG Central Bank  ] Governor [PER David Oddson  ] has been the most obviously enthusiastic . 
If the [ORG Central Bank  ] announcement was an attempt by this former Prime Minister and champion wheeler-dealer to pressure lagging friends - particularly the [LOC U.S.  ] - into quickly offering their own loans , the game has not been successful . 
Except for [LOC Norway  ] , whose Foreign Minister announced a loan today , the [MISC Nordics  ] and the rest of the potential lenders continue to mull over a decision. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) There is little public or government support for the loan except as a last-ditch effort to rescue [LOC Iceland  ] from financial ruin . 
Since the closing of the base at [LOC Keflavik  ] in late 2006 , the Icelanders have kept a wary eye on the increasingly visible [MISC Russian  ] military activities in the [LOC High North  ] . 
They don't like the [MISC Russian  ] presence in the [LOC North Atlantic  ] and don't want to encourage it . 
This government most particularly doesn't want to be beholden to [LOC Moscow  ] . 
No letter to [LOC Russia  ] was included in the flurry of missives sent last week to potential lenders , including the [LOC U.S.  ] , the [ORG European Central Bank  ] , [LOC China  ] , [LOC Japan  ] , and the [MISC Nordics  ] . 
However , if the Icelanders can't find the USD four million they need to complete the agreement with the [ORG IMF  ] from sources they prefer , then sheer necessity will dictate that they take whatever the [MISC Russians  ] make available . 
As to the terms of that loan , stated or implied , the deepening financial crisis and the pending social upheaval here suggests that the [MISC Icelandic  ] government will be in no position to be too choosy .
