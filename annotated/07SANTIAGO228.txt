C ) [ORG SANTIAGO  ] 202 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Craig Kelly  ] for reasons 1.5 ( b and d ) . ------ Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) The December 2006 death of [PER Augusto Pinochet  ] - seemingly a watershed moment in [LOC Chile  ] 's recent history - has faded remarkably quickly from public discourse . 
[MISC Feverish  ] media commentary at the time - fed by juxtaposed images of still loyal supporters weeping while opponents popped champagne bottles - suggested , initially , that [LOC Chile  ] was in for a long period of rancorous and divisive debate between left and right . 
Instead , [LOC Chile  ] , now a thriving democracy with strong institutions , has apparently heaved an introspective sigh of relief over its past , and has moved on to the challenges of its present and future . 
End summary. ------------- Dead and Gone ------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) After the 1975 death of [MISC Spanish  ] dictator [PER Francisco Franco  ] , " Saturday Night Live 's " [PER Chevy Chase  ] would regularly open his faux newscast with the observation that " [PER Francisco Franco  ] is still dead . 
" In [LOC Chile  ] , former dictator [PER Augusto Pinochet  ] , who died December 10 , 2006 , not only remains that way , he seems to almost have never existed . 
This is surprising given the outpouring of emotion that accompanied his passing ( refs A and B ) , as supporters and detractors fought - thankfully largely figuratively - to define [PER Pinochet  ] 's legacy. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) For approximately ten days after his death , media coverage was intense , with all major newspapers and television outlets running retrospectives on [PER Pinochet  ] 's life . 
These included exhaustive analyses of the rationale behind the 1973 coup , the accomplishments and failings of the regime during its 17-year run , and the long , somewhat tawdry , denouement to [PER Pinochet  ] 's life , after he relinquished power in <a id='par1990' href='#par1990'>¶</a>1990 . 
But since then , virtually , the silence of the grave. ------------------ Appeals to History ------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The intense - if short - debate over [PER Pinochet  ] 's life and times revolved around three principal questions: 1 ) In toppling the [PER Allende  ] government , did he save [LOC Chile  ] from something worse ( than what he in turn imposed ) ; 2 ) Did the market-oriented economic policies he implemented , many of which caused considerable hardship but which most agree laid the groundwork for [LOC Chile  ] 's current economic success , outweigh the negative of unquestioned human rights abuses ; and 3 ) Do the allegations of corruption lodged against him and his family permanently mar his legacy , regardless of how the first two questions are answered ? <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Clearly , where one stands on these matters depends on where one sits at the ideological table . 
[PER Pinochet  ] sympathizers - and they remain a significant segment of the populace - argued loudly that [PER Allende  ] had been leading [LOC Chile  ] to chaos at best , a totalitarian nightmare at worst , with [PER Pinochet  ] a [MISC Cold War  ] savior . 
In their view , one that carried considerable weight in the still moderately conservative major newspapers , [PER Pinochet  ] 's opening of [LOC Chile  ] 's economy to the world was visionary , setting the country firmly on the path to stability and prosperity . 
Human rights abuses were regrettable , but forgivable in the context of a virtual civil war . 
Finally , allegations of corruption are unproven slander against a giant of history. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) For strong Pincohet detractors - who by most reliable estimates outnumber his backers - such talk is little more than [MISC Orwellian  ] whitewash . 
They depict [PER Pinochet  ] as an unprincipled tyrant , who subverted the democratic order , betraying the very man who had given him his position . 
His economic policies were imposed by an iron hand , crushing labor rights , and causing considerable hardship for the poorest [MISC Chileans  ] . 
[PER Pinochet  ] 's abuse of human rights was untrammeled , setting the gold standard for similar abuses across the continent , throughout the seventies and eighties . 
And , on top of it all , he was a crook , who with his family stole millions of dollars from the [MISC Chilean  ] people. ----------------- Death Warmed Over ----------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) By Christmas 2006 , however , that feverish discourse had seemingly played itself out . 
In recent discussions with [MISC Chileans  ] as to why [PER Pinochet  ] has dropped off the screen , one telling comment was made by [PER Rodrigo Novoa  ] , executive director of a leading judicial studies center . 
[PER Novoa  ] , in his thirties and with little memory of the [PER Pinochet  ] years , leans right politically . 
He told the Ambassador that " for most [MISC Chileans  ] , [PER Pinochet  ] died a long time ago . 
" His boss , [PER Estaban Tomic  ] , an older man , and politically to [PER Novoa  ] 's left , nodded agreement ( [PER Tomic  ] was in exile during much of the [PER Pinochet  ] era and was former President [MISC Lagos'  ] representative to the [ORG OAS  ] ) . <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Tomic  ] related that he was present when [PER Patricio Aylwin  ] was sworn in as President in 1990 , promising to be president for all [MISC Chileans  ] , " civilian and military . 
" Hearing [PER Aylwin  ] extend that olive branch to the military ( out of prudence or otherwise ) , [PER Tomic  ] said that he and [MISC Chileans  ] across the ideological spectrum breathed a sigh of relief . 
It was clear even then that there was no desire to go back , neither by the left to the [PER Allende  ] years nor the right to a military regime . 
In the years since , the revelations of human rights abuses and corruption had contributed to what amounted to [PER Pinochet  ] 's growing irrelevance . 
His physical passing had elicited , for most [MISC Chileans  ] , little more than a second sigh of relief. ----------------------------- Whistling Past the Graveyard ? ----------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) With [PER Pinochet  ] now out of sight , the question is whether he is also out of mind and , if so , for how long . 
The example of [LOC Spain  ] and of its grappling with the [PER Franco  ] legacy could again prove illustrative . 
There are clear differences: [LOC Spain  ] 's civil war dragged on for nearly three years , ravaging the country and leaving exponentially many more thousands dead . 
[PER Franco  ] 's dictatorship lasted more than twice as long as Pincohet 's . 
But there are similarities as well - [MISC Cold War  ] concerns , including an uneasy relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] ; post-conflict human rights abuses ; dictated ( albeit successful ) economic reforms . 
Yet it is only now , some 30 years after [PER Franco  ] 's passing , that [LOC Spain  ] is taking a painful , closer look at its past and , in doing so , putting what appears from media reporting here to be a significant strain on its social fabric . 
Are [MISC Chileans  ] simply postponing a similar reckoning ? <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Even if [MISC Chileans  ] put off for a decade or two a determined examination of [PER Pinochet  ] 's legacy , no serious harm will ensue . 
First , and without in any way diminishing the pain and suffering of the regime 's victims , the number killed was significantly less ( approximately 3,000 ) than what occurred in [LOC Spain  ] , albeit not counting those tortured or made to suffer psychologically or otherwise ( loss of family members , employment , social status ) . 
As the Ambassador noted in a recent visit to [PER Villa Grimaldi  ] , [PER Pinochet  ] 's most notorious torture center , such practices should " never again " be tolerated , regardless of the ideological origin of the abuse ( ref C ) . 
Nonetheless , the generational spread which defines the [MISC Spanish  ] experience of war and remembrance is not present here. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) With the exception of the most fervent anti-Pinochistas , the majority of [MISC Chileans  ] accept that the regime laid the groundwork for the economic growth and relative prosperity they enjoy today . 
They may argue passionately about the details and just how much credit [PER Pinochet  ] himself deserves , but they share the common assumption that there was some good done there . 
Other Pinochet-era achievements include a forcible breakup of a state educational monopoly that fostered the rapid growth of quality private universities . 
[PER Pinochet  ] also handled diplomatic relations with his neighbors skillfully , avoiding conflict with [LOC Argentina  ] despite [MISC Chilean  ] assistance to [LOC Great Britain  ] during the [MISC Falklands War  ] . 
He also with his fellow strongman in [LOC Bolivia  ] , [PER Hugo Banzer  ] , made great strides towards resolving the issue of [MISC Bolivian  ] access to the sea , failing only due to [MISC Peruvian  ] objections. -------------- Live and Learn -------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) If there is an immediate cautionary lesson for [MISC Chileans  ] it lies in the curious coincidence that [PER Pinochet  ] 's death came as the leftist [ORG Concertacion  ] alliance which replaced him entered into its 17th year of governance -- the same number of years that [PER Pinochet  ] ruled . 
Even for his admirers , [PER Pinochet  ] 's star dimmed as he lingered in power and , when he finally did step down , allegations of corruption tarnished him further . 
While it may be too early to say if the [ORG Concertacion  ] is suffering from similar fatigue , it has been buffeted over the past year by charges of corruption of its own. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) For the [LOC U.S.  ] , the mature response of [MISC Chilean  ] democracy to [PER Pinochet  ] 's passing is certainly welcome , evidence that the polarization of [MISC Chilean  ] politics is a thing of the past . 
While there remains a strong right with loyalties to [PER Pinochet  ] , and a smallish hard-core left that would like to see some on the right painted as [PER Pinochet  ] collaborators , the moderate center largely holds sway . 
[MISC Chileans  ] , at least for today , seem determined not to spend much time looking back or in excessive introspection . 
This complements our own agenda with the [ORG GOC  ] , one which encourages regional leadership , outward-oriented thinking , and a focus on the future .
