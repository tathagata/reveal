E.O. 12958 Reason 1.4 ( B/D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [ORG Summary: Israel Security Agency  ] ( [ORG ISA  ] ) Director [PER Yuval Diskin  ] told the [ORG USSC  ] , LTG [PER Keith W. Dayton  ] , that [MISC Israel’s  ] primary concern with the normalization of operations at the [LOC Rafah  ] terminal are derived from [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Palestinian  ] failures to follow through with commitments made in the November 15 , 2005 Access and Movements Agreement ( [ORG AMA  ] ) , and not with the procedural activities of [ORG European Union Border Assistance Mission  ] and the [ORG Presidential Guard  ] , whose service [PER Diskin  ] characterized as “very good.” [PER Diskin  ] told the [ORG USSC  ] that he continued to support the strengthening of President [PER Abbas  ] and the [ORG Presidential Guard  ] , but noted that it was more important to strengthen [PER Fatah  ] as a movement than focus on bolstering [MISC Abbas’  ] personal position . 
In response to the [MISC USSC’s  ] brief on the [MISC Palestinian  ] Liberation Army’s Jordan-based [PER Badr Brigade  ] , [PER Diskin  ] told the [ORG USSC  ] that he did not have any objections to the [MISC Brigade’s  ] proposed deployment to [LOC North Gaza  ] , but added that he didn’t believe they would be able to accomplish anything on the ground unless they were incorporated into the [ORG Presidential Guard  ] . 
[PER Diskin  ] presented an analysis of the security situation in [LOC Gaza  ] and the [LOC West Bank  ] and told the [ORG USSC  ] that while clashes between [ORG Hamas  ] and elements of [PER Fatah  ] had been fierce , he did not believe the [MISC Palestinians  ] were on the verge of a civil war because neither side wanted one due to internal dynamics , and for fear of a future political fallout with the populace at the polls . 
[PER Diskin  ] provided a bleak assessment of the principal [MISC Palestinian  ] security players: [PER Mohammed Dahlan  ] , [ORG Rashid Abu Shabak  ] , [PER Tawfic Tirawi  ] and [PER Abu Hisham  ] . 
He concluded that none were capable of providing the necessary leadership to direct the activities of the security services in both [LOC Gaza  ] and the [LOC West Bank  ] . 
Diskin’s view of Egypt’s role in [LOC Gaza  ] was that [LOC Egypt  ] enjoyed connections with all [MISC Palestinian  ] factions , but he felt their influence had declined in the wake of their inability to solve the [MISC Corporal Shalit  ] crisis . 
He added that [LOC Egypt  ] could be helpful by strengthening its efforts to curtail rampant smuggling between the [MISC Egyptian  ] , [MISC Israeli  ] , and [MISC Gazan  ] borders . 
End Summary. ------------- [LOC Rafah Passage  ] ------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG U.S. Security Coordinator LTG Dayton  ] briefed [ORG ISA  ] Director , [PER Yuval Diskin  ] , October 6 on USG and [ORG EUBAM  ] positions on the [LOC Rafah  ] passage and the need for the normalization of operations at the [LOC Rafah  ] crossing . 
[PER Diskin  ] told [ORG LTG Dayton  ] that while [ORG EUBAM  ] and the [ORG Presidential Guard  ] “were doing a good job , ” [MISC Israel’s  ] main problem had to do with promises and understandings made with the [LOC U.S.  ] side on the November 15 , 2005 Agreement on Movement and Access , which were never fulfilled due to what he termed “internal bickering between the [ORG State Department  ] and another organ of the [LOC U.S.  ] government.” The problem that [PER Diskin  ] spoke of had to do with the passage of certain [MISC Palestinians  ] traveling in both directions through the crossing . 
[PER Diskin  ] went on to say that his agency possessed intelligence which showed [MISC Palestinians  ] were utilizing the passage to ultimately travel to [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Lebanon  ] in order to increase [ORG Hamas  ] capabilities . 
Diskin’s stated opinion is “once the base of the Agreement on [LOC Rafah  ] is not good , it doesn’t matter to me that the procedural aspects of the running of the crossing are good.” [PER Diskin  ] told [ORG LTG Dayton  ] that he believed it was important to keep [LOC Rafah  ] open , but added that the original agreement was made in different circumstances with a [PER Fatah  ] government , not the current [ORG Hamas  ] one: “If we want to approach this seriously , we need to start with the movements of people.” [PER Diskin  ] stated that we should initiate meetings between the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC Israel  ] , the [MISC Palestinians  ] and [ORG EU  ] first , and then later bring the [MISC Egyptians  ] into the picture. - -------------------------------------- [PER Abbas  ] , [PER FATAH  ] and the [ORG Presidential Guard  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Diskin  ] told the [ORG USSC  ] that he continued to support the enhancement of the power of President [PER Abbas  ] and the [ORG Presidential Guard  ] . 
He went on to say that the long term strategic problem was the weakness of [PER Fatah  ] , not [PER Hamas:  ] “We don’t need to give more power to [PER Abbas  ] ; we need to strengthen the power of [PER Fatah  ] as a movement . 
Currently they are not motivated to do anything . 
The weakness of the security apparatus stems from the weakness of [LOC Fatah.”  ] ------------ [PER Badr Brigade  ] ------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG LTG Dayton  ] asked [PER Diskin  ] for his assessment of the Jordan-based [MISC Palestinian  ] Badr Brigade . 
[PER Diskin  ] stated that he did not see a problem with their proposed deployment to northern [LOC Gaza  ] , though he did not believe they would be effective. “They will likely become just another [MISC Palestinian  ] group such as the [ORG NSF  ] , unless they are absorbed directly into the [ORG Presidential Guard.”  ] ------------ No [ORG Civil War  ] ------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) LTG [LOC Dayton  ] briefed [PER Diskin  ] on [ORG USSC  ] efforts to bolster the [ORG Palestinian National Security Forces  ] ( [ORG NSF  ] . 
) [PER Diskin  ] agreed with the utility of the move and presented an overall security assessment of the situation in [LOC Gaza  ] and the [LOC West Bank  ] . 
[PER Diskin  ] stated that a pattern has emerged whereby clashes between [PER Fatah  ] and [ORG Hamas  ] in [LOC Gaza  ] , where [PER Fatah  ] is weak , elicit strong [PER Fatah  ] responses in the [LOC West Bank  ] where [PER Fatah  ] is militarily stronger than [ORG Hamas.  ] “I don’t believe that we are on the verge of a [MISC Palestinian  ] civil war . 
Neither side , for their own reasons , want internal armed conflict . 
They are both against a civil war because [PER Fitna  ] ( civil strife , chaos ) will cause both sides more problems than they can handle and harms their efforts to garner positive public opinion.” [PER Diskin  ] caveated his assessment with a warning that , should something happen to [ORG Haniyeh  ] on the [ORG Hamas  ] side , or [PER Mohammed Dahlan  ] or [ORG Rashid Abu Shabak  ] on the [PER Fatah  ] side , anything could happen . 
He added that , “If [PER Abbas  ] were to do something which would cause [ORG Hamas  ] to feel their hold on the government is in jeopardy , the situation could deteriorate and make things worse than they are today.” -------------------------------------------- Search for [ORG Palestinian Security Interlocutor  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The balance of the conversation centered on [ORG LTG Dayton’s  ] efforts to identify an effective [MISC Palestinian  ] security interlocutor . 
In response to [ORG LTG Dayton’s  ] question of who [PER Diskin  ] would choose to work with if he could make the choice for [MISC Palestinians  ] , [PER Diskin  ] told the [ORG USSC:  ] “There is no perfect fit to the question you have asked , a couple of people have what you need , but only partly.” He said that the best that you can do would be [PER Mohammed Dahlan  ] and [PER Tawfic Tirawi  ] . 
He then presented estimations of the primary [MISC Palestinian  ] security players ; [ORG Rashid Abu Shabak  ] , [PER Tawfic Tirawi  ] , [PER Mohammed Dahlan  ] and [PER Abu Hisham  ] . 
[PER Diskin  ] stated that [ORG Rashid Abu Shabak  ] is weaker than he used to be , and under tremendous pressure because President [PER Abbas  ] had put him in an impossible situation , with an impossible mission as Director of [ORG Internal Security  ] . 
Subsequently , [PER Diskin  ] stated “he cannot deliver and is not motivated to do so.” [PER Diskin  ] told [ORG LTG Dayton  ] that [PER Tawfic Tirawi  ] is capable of accomplishing some of the things which need to be done in the [LOC West Bank.  ] “He is motivated , cruel and decisive , but has no standing in [LOC Gaza.”  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Diskin  ] characterized [PER Mohammed Dahlan  ] as a man who is smart enough , and one who understands the arena and all the players better than anyone , but his capabilities are weaker than they have ever been and he is under a lot of pressure . 
[PER Dahlan  ] “has no power base in the [LOC West Bank  ] and continues to rely on the [ORG Preventative Security Organization  ] ( [ORG PSO  ] ) as his power base , but as you have seen , the [ORG PSO  ] has been under tremendous pressure from [ORG Hamas  ] in [LOC Gaza.”  ] XXXXXXXXXXXX [PER Diskin  ] emphasized that “We must keep the [ORG PSO  ] alive in [LOC Gaza.”  ] [PER Diskin  ] then moved to [PER Abu Hisham  ] and told the [ORG USSC  ] that [PER Hisham  ] is “pleasantly honest , he doesn’t lie to us and keeps us informed , he is very accurate , but he has no power base and is not a leader . 
It puts us both in a bad position.” --------------------- [MISC Egyptian  ] Role in [LOC Gaza  ] --------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) In response to [ORG LTG Dayton’s  ] question on Egypt’s ability to influence matters in [LOC Gaza  ] , [PER Diskin  ] replied that the [MISC Egyptians  ] have ties across the [MISC Palestinian  ] spectrum within [LOC Gaza  ] , but no influence: “The most important thing they can do is stop the smuggling which takes place between their borders with both [LOC Gaza  ] and [LOC Israel.” CRETZ</pre></code>  ]
