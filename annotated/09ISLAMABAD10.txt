<code><pre>S E C R E T ISLAMABAD 000010 EO 12958 DECL: 01/03/2034 TAGS PREL , PTER , PK , IN SUBJECT: PRESERVING INFORMATION SHARING REF: A. NEW DELHI 10 B. [ORG FBI  ] //1314/01907/366/0013// Classified By: [PER Anne W. Patterson  ] , reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Post notes with some concern the report ( [MISC Ref A  ] ) that the [ORG GOI Ministry of External Affairs  ] plans to release information from its investigation into the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks next week to all countries that lost citizens and “that therefore any information sharing will be overtaken by events.” [MISC Ref A  ] says a sanitized version will be released and “widely disseminated.” <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) We believe it is premature for the [MISC Indians  ] to be considering a broad dissemination of information on the attack until the investigation has been completed . 
In this regard , we note that the [ORG FBI  ] has just presented a long list of information it is still seeking from the [MISC Indians  ] to advance its own investigation . 
Most importantly , we believe there are still [PER Lashkar-e-Taiba  ] ( LeT ) sleeper and other cells in [LOC India  ] , [LOC Nepal  ] , [LOC Bangladesh  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] , as well as many law enforcement leads which need to be pursued . 
To prevent another potential attack , we need to keep channels of cooperation and information sharing open . 
We are concerned that the [MISC Indians’  ] premature public dissemination of this information will undermine essential law enforcement efforts and forestall further [MISC Indo-Pak  ] cooperation . 
Our goal is not only to bring the perpetrators of this attack to justice , but also to begin a dialogue that will reduce tensions between [LOC India  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
3 ( [ORG S  ] ) ISI Director General [PER Pasha  ] has just approved the sharing of tearline information on [MISC Pakistan’s  ] investigation with [MISC Indian  ] intelligence , after assurances from [ORG CIA  ] that information would be tightly held in intelligence channels only . 
Gaining [MISC GOP  ] approval for this release was a significant step forward for the [MISC Pakistanis  ] . 
But as [MISC Ref A  ] notes , “the question of information sharing may be overtaken by events.” If [PER Pasha  ] is embarrassed by what is essentially public dissemination without the [MISC Indians  ] providing the results of their own investigation to [LOC Pakistan  ] , it will undercut [MISC Pakistan’s  ] ability to pursue its investigation , generate a public backlash in [LOC Pakistan  ] , and could undermine [PER Pasha  ] personally. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Therefore , we believe Department should urge the [ORG GOI  ] to delay the release of information about their investigation until intelligence and law enforcement sharing with the [MISC GOP  ] ( and with us ) has been able to move forward .
