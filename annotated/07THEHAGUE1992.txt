POL/ECON IN THE NL 11/09/07 AND 11/14/07 Classified By: AMBASSADOR ROLAND E. [PER ARNALL  ] FOR REASONS 1.4 ( B/D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: During his November 5-8 visit to [LOC Moscow  ] , [MISC Dutch  ] Prime Minister [PER Balkenende  ] engaged [MISC Russian  ] President [PER Putin  ] on tough issues such as [LOC Kosovo  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , and human rights in addition to announcing a major multi-billion dollar gas pipeline deal ( reported septels ) . 
[PER Balkenende  ] believes that strong economic ties with [LOC Russia  ] and demonstrating respect for [MISC Russian  ] pride are the keys to influencing [PER Putin  ] . 
Although [PER Balkenende  ] claimed to have delivered a strong and clear message on the need to respect democratic norms , he was later criticized in [LOC Parliament  ] for appearing to place [MISC Dutch  ] economic interests ahead of human rights concerns . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In a November 13 meeting with Ambassador [PER Arnall  ] , [MISC Dutch  ] Prime Minister [PER Jan Pieter Balkenende  ] expressed satisfaction regarding his November 5-8 visit to [LOC Moscow  ] . 
Without directly referring to the substantial new energy cooperation agreements announced during the visit -- for which [PER Balkenende  ] has been criticized in [LOC Parliament  ] ( refs ) -- [PER Balkenende  ] argued that the [LOC Netherlands'  ] growing economic ties to [LOC Russia  ] make it possible to engage [MISC Russian  ] President [PER Putin  ] directly on the most difficult issues . 
[PER Balkenende  ] stressed that he did not shy away from discussing sensitive issues , such as human rights , both in public and in his private conversations with [ORG Putin.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Balkenende  ] proudly noted that he and [PER Putin  ] were able to conduct nearly all of their conversations in [MISC German  ] , which , he said , allowed for a more open and direct conversation than working through translators . 
[PER Putin  ] , he added , was obviously a clever guy who was well briefed on every issue discussed . 
According to [PER Balkenende  ] , [PER Putin  ] readily acknowledges that there are serious problems in [LOC Russia  ] , such as corruption , and was willing to listen to constructive criticism . 
At the same time , however , [PER Putin  ] remains sensitive to perceived slights to [LOC Russia  ] 's status as a great power , and is motivated -- in [PER Balkenende  ] 's view -- as much by national pride as by geopolitical or economic considerations . 
Treating [PER Putin  ] , and [LOC Russia  ] , with respect , therefore , is a necessary first step before engaging on tough issues . 
KOSOVO: ------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) According to [PER Balkenende  ] , [PER Putin  ] showed little concern over the lack of progress on [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
Asked what would happen if no agreement satisfactory to both sides can be reached by December 10 , [PER Putin  ] told [ORG Balkenende:  ] then we go to December <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
[PER Putin  ] also reportedly tried to downplay the potential for regional instability by noting that other countries in [LOC Europe  ] -- such as [LOC Belgium  ] or [LOC Ireland  ] -- are also divided along ethnic , religious , or linguistic differences . 
[PER Balkenende  ] dismissed these arguments and stressed that there is no point in talking and talking without ever reaching a solution . 
On the other hand , [PER Balkenende  ] made clear to Ambassador [PER Arnall  ] that he is deeply worried about divisions within the [ORG EU  ] should [LOC Kosovo  ] unilaterally declare independence , a development that would post the most serious challenge to the [ORG EU  ] in fifteen years . 
IRAN/MISSILE DEFENSE: --------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) On [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Balkenende  ] said he had impressed on [PER Putin  ] the importance of maintaining a united front to ensure [LOC Iran  ] does not succeed in acquiring nuclear weapons . 
He also underscored the key roles of the [ORG IAEA  ] and the [ORG UNSC  ] , and the potential damage to their credibility should [LOC Iran  ] continue to ignore its obligations . 
[PER Balkenende  ] said [PER Putin  ] had demonstrated a deep understanding of the situation and appeared genuinely concerned . 
He added that the [MISC Russians  ] believed they had detected a new , more positive tone in their recent dealings with [LOC Iran  ] ( and with Supreme Leader [PER Khameini  ] in particular ) , but did not elaborate . 
( Note: Per ref A , [ORG MFA Political Director  ] [PER Pieter de Gooijer  ] is in [LOC Tehran  ] this week . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) On the related issue of missile defense , [PER Balkenende  ] was pleased that recent talks between senior [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Russian  ] officials appeared to have taken some of the heat out of [MISC Russian  ] opposition to a [MISC U.S.-proposed  ] missile shield in [LOC Eastern Europe  ] . 
That said , the sides clearly remained far apart and it will be difficult to find a compromise . 
[PER Putin  ] , he added , continued to push for increased dialogue between [LOC Russia  ] and [ORG NATO  ] on this issue . 
DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS: --------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Balkenende  ] was adamant that he was not afraid to raise human rights concerns during his visit . 
He noted that he met with [ORG NGO  ] 's working on civil society and rule of law projects receiving assistance from the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
In his private meetings with [PER Putin  ] , and in his press interviews , he had also stressed the [MISC Dutch  ] commitment to democracy and the rule of law . 
( Note: Per ref B , [PER Putin  ] apparently later criticized [PER Balkenende  ] for some of his public remarks . 
) [PER Balkenende  ] stressed , however , that such comments would fall on deaf ears if not accompanied by appropriate gestures of respect and understanding for [LOC Russia  ] 's unique situation . 
Unlike the [LOC U.S.  ] or the [LOC Netherlands  ] , [LOC Russia  ] has had at most sixteen years of democracy . 
[PER Putin  ] , he added , is admired internally for his strong leadership -- to the point that most [MISC Western  ] leaders should and do envy his popularity ratings . 
COMMENT: -------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Balkenende  ] was obviously impressed by [PER Putin  ] and feels that he is someone he can do business with -- literally , in fact . 
The announcement of a multi-billion dollar accord between [ORG Gazprom  ] and the [MISC Dutch  ] gas company [ORG GasUnie  ] during the visit opened the Prime Minister to criticism -- including from some members of his own party -- for appearing to place [MISC Dutch  ] economic interests ahead of human rights' concerns . 
The fact that the deal was announced the same week the Foreign Minister publicly presented the Cabinet 's new , more aggressive international [ORG Human Rights Policy  ] to [LOC Parliament  ] only heightened the contrast and further motivated [PER Balkenende  ] 's opponents to attack him ; at one point , Foreign Minister [PER Verhagen  ] found himself calling the Prime Minister in [LOC Moscow  ] directly from [LOC Parliament  ] for guidance . 
Several contacts have since acknowledged that holding the two events so close together was a serious miscalculation .
