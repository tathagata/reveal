( C ) Summary: On June 13 , Polchief and Pol FSN met with [PER Ben Botwe  ] , who recently took over from [ORG Major General Richardson Baiden  ] as the Acting Executive Director of [ORG Ghana’s Narcotics Control Board  ] ( [ORG NCB  ] ) . 
[PER Botwe  ] is preparing a budget for urgent funding priorities and wants to build a stronger relationship with the police . 
He lacks security or law enforcement experience and we question whether he has the political weight or support to make an impact in his new job . 
The [MISC British  ] continue to be very discouraged by the narcotics situation in [LOC Ghana  ] . 
Other governments share these concerns and the [MISC Mini-Dublin  ] group of donors plans to write to the Minister of [LOC Interior  ] urging more effective action against narcotics trafficking . 
End summary . 
Meeting the New [MISC Man  ] at [ORG NCB  ] -------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Botwe  ] , who only started two weeks ago , said he plans to create a three-year strategic plan for counternarcotics . 
Asked about the dimension of the narcotics concern , he said “shipments are happening , ” although he was not sure why they are coming to [LOC Ghana  ] . 
He wants to establish SOPs for handling relations with other government agencies and to strengthen [ORG Human Resources  ] management . 
He saw the need to strengthen existing programs , rebuild internal structures , and work with the media on an anti-drug campaign. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In the short-term , he will prepare an “immediate needs budget” for the Minister of [LOC Interior  ] , who he claims has assured him additional resources . 
[ORG NCB  ] has just graduated 35 new recruits as core field staff but needs additional vehicles and equipment . 
[PER Botwe  ] said the [ORG GOG  ] has approved 60 more new recruits before the end of 2007 . 
He hopes to work with local authorities to strengthen air and sea interdiction as well as intelligence gathering . 
Equipping the navy to do a better job in counternarcotics is a high priority , he said. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Botwe  ] hoped to strengthen the NCB’s relationship with the [LOC Ghana  ] Police Service and opined that the recent dismissal of over 80 police officers suspected of narcotics offenses is a healthy “purging” of the police system . 
He thought the [ORG NCB  ] should take the lead in narcotics intelligence gathering , monitoring , coordination and reporting , providing overall direction for counternarcotics while also helping other agencies with expertise and capacity building . 
The [ORG NCB  ] should participate in operations but it has no prosecutorial or arrest authority and its agents are unarmed , he said , lamenting that in the past the [ORG NCB  ] had taken on too many police duties . 
This had created tension with the police , reducing the [MISC GOG’s  ] ability to conduct sustained raids , he said . 
Brief Bio --------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) [PER Benjamin Kwame Botwe  ] ( 47 ) was the Chief Regulatory Officer and Deputy Chief Executive ( [ORG Drugs Division  ] ) of the [ORG Food and Drugs Board  ] from 2000-2007 . 
Starting in 1988 , he held different jobs at the [ORG Food and Drugs Board  ] , including three years ( 1997-2000 ) as Principal Enforcement Officer . 
He holds a Masters in [ORG Public Administration  ] from the [LOC Ghana  ] Institute of Management and [ORG Public Administration  ] ( [ORG GIMPA  ] ) and a Masters of Science ( [ORG Pharmaceutical Analysis  ] ) in Quality and Management . 
Other Government Views of Narcotics in [LOC Ghana  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [MISC British  ] remain very concerned about narcotics trends in [LOC Ghana  ] . 
A [MISC British  ] Embassy official provided PolChief with data from [ORG Operation Westbridge  ] , a U.K.-supported program to strengthen narcotics interdiction at [LOC Accra’s  ] airport . 
He reported that in the seven months since the start of this [ORG Operation  ] at the end of November , 2006 the [LOC UK  ] had made 51 seizures of narcotics originating [LOC ACCRA  ] 00001437 002.2 OF 002 from [LOC Ghana  ] , totaling 197.5 kilograms of cocaine , 713 kilograms of cannabis and 300 grams of heroin . 
[ORG Operation Westbridge  ] is ongoing but will now shift from screening passengers to also screening freight . 
Lagos-based [MISC British  ] Serious [ORG Organized Crime  ] ( [ORG SOCA  ] ) Officer [PER John King  ] recently met PolChief after several days of discussions with counternarotics contacts in [LOC Accra  ] , including the Ministers of [LOC Interior  ] and [LOC National Security  ] . 
[PER King  ] told PolChief that the [LOC U.K.  ] recently shared intelligence with the [ORG GOG  ] on a vessel coming to [LOC Ghana  ] from [LOC South America  ] suspected to be carrying cocaine . 
[PER King  ] said a vessel left from [LOC Tema  ] to provide the suspect ship with fuel and water . 
According to [PER King  ] , however , the [LOC Ghana  ] navy failed to find it and may not have even tried ( although it is not clear to us that the navy received the [LOC U.K.  ] information ) . 
[PER King  ] found Minister of [MISC Interior Kan-Dapaah  ] dismissive and irritated when [PER King  ] raised problems with narcotics at the airport . 
[PER King  ] concluded that the [ORG GOG  ] was more indifferent to the narcotics issue than in 2006 and had made little progress to tackle this problem in the past year. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) These concerns were mirrored in a June 25 [ORG Mini-Dublin Group  ] meeting , the second such narcotics cooperation meeting held in [LOC Accra  ] , hosted by the [MISC French  ] Embassy and attended by diplomats from the [LOC U.S.  ] , [MISC Dutch  ] , [MISC Spanish  ] , [MISC Italian  ] , [MISC British  ] , and [MISC German  ] Embassies . 
The [MISC French  ] DCM told the group that two weeks ago a [MISC French  ] naval vessel intercepted a ship loaded with cocaine coming to [LOC Ghana  ] from [LOC South America  ] . 
Given concerns about narcotics trafficking here , a [MISC French  ] narcotics liaison officer will be assigned to [LOC Ghana  ] starting in September , she said . 
The [MISC German  ] official noted that [ORG Lufthansa  ] is seeing small but increasing quantities of narcotics trafficking on its flights out of [LOC Ghana  ] . 
The [MISC Germans  ] are also exploring assigning a permanent narcotics liaison officer to [LOC Accra  ] . 
The [MISC Italian  ] rep said their [MISC Dakar-based  ] narcotics watcher is reporting a large increase of narcotics trafficking from [LOC South America  ] through [LOC West Africa  ] . 
The group agreed to send a joint letter to the Minister of [LOC Interior  ] expressing growing concerns about [MISC Ghana’s  ] narcotics situation . 
Comment ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Botwe  ] hopes he can apply to the [ORG NCB  ] his experience combating counterfeit drugs at the [ORG Food and Drugs Board  ] . 
His approach is bureaucratic , focused on structures , plans and institutional arrangements . 
He brings to the job managerial and some drug-related experience . 
This may be helpful in rebuilding the [ORG NCB  ] if he has the resources and political will to back him . 
As recently as June 19 , Minister of Interior [PER Albert Kan-Dapaah  ] publicly asserted that “restructuring and strengthening the [ORG NCB  ] , particularly its human resource capacity , is one of the key issues the government has decided to implement.” He reportedly told a recent Heads of [LOC Mission  ] meeting that he was very concerned about [MISC Ghana’s  ] growing narcotics problem and its potential impact on [MISC Ghanaian  ] politics . 
The additional [ORG NCB  ] recruits and Botwe’s desire to strengthen coordination with the police are positive developments. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) While these are still early days for [PER Botwe  ] , his nomination appears to be one more discouraging sign of the [MISC GOG’s  ] weak counternarcotics efforts , reinforcing our impressions from the [MISC Ambassador’s  ] recent meeting with President [PER Kufuor  ] and from PolChief’s recent meeting with the [PER Attorney General  ] ( reftels ) , in addition to the worries of our colleagues in the [ORG Dublin Group  ] . 
[PER Botwe  ] lacks experience dealing with illicit narcotics and turned to his deputy , a senior police officer , on any substantive questions . 
He lacks the energy or independent political standing of his predecessor , who nonetheless was unable to make much impact . 
More worrisome , according to our Political Assistant Locally Engaged Staff , [PER Botwe  ] had a reputation at the [ORG Food and Drugs Board  ] for being amenable to influence .
