( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security [PER Ellen Tauscher  ] visited [LOC Israel  ] December 1-2 . 
[PER U/S Tauscher  ] focused her visit on setting the stage for a successful [MISC Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  ] ( [ORG NPT  ] ) [ORG Review Conference  ] ( [ORG RevCon  ] ) in May 2010 . 
She consulted with [ORG GOI  ] interlocutors on potential strategy in addressing [MISC Egyptian  ] insistence on pushing for the establishment of a nuclear weapon free zone ( [ORG NWFZ  ] ) in the [LOC Middle East  ] , as a way to divert attention from [LOC Iran  ] to [LOC Israel  ] . 
[PER U/S Tauscher  ] reiterated that the [LOC United States  ] will not take any action to compromise [LOC Israel  ] 's security and would consult closely with [LOC Israel  ] -- which [ORG GOI  ] officials greatly appreciated . 
Nevertheless , [PER U/S Tauscher  ] said the [LOC United States  ] is interested in exploring possible small steps involving [LOC Israel  ] to address some of [LOC Egypt  ] 's [ORG NWFZ  ] concerns regarding the lack of implementation of the 1995 resolution . 
[ORG GOI  ] officials for the most part were critical of these tactics , questioning why [LOC Israel  ] should be portrayed as part of the problem . 
They recommended a more direct approach to President [PER Mubarak  ] -- thereby circumventing the [MISC Egyptian  ] [ORG MFA  ] -- in which [LOC Egypt  ] is reminded that [LOC Iran  ] is the regional nuclear threat . 
Other topics discussed include President [PER Obama  ] 's arms control and nonproliferation agenda , the [ORG P5  ] 1 process and [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program , the [MISC FMCT  ] and [MISC CTBT  ] , [LOC Jordan  ] 's plans for a nuclear reactor , and [LOC Israel  ] 's qualitative military edge ( [ORG QME  ] ) . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER U/S Tauscher  ] met with [ORG National Security Advisor  ] [PER Uzi Arad  ] on December 1 . 
[PER Arad  ] was accompanied by [ORG NSC Senior Advisor and Nuclear Security Summit  ] Sherpa [PER Gil Reich  ] . 
In a separate meeting on December 1 , [PER U/S Tauscher  ] met with [ORG MFA  ] Director General [PER Yossi Gal  ] , Deputy Director General for [LOC North America  ] [PER Baruch Bina  ] , and Deputy Director General for [ORG Strategic Affairs Alon Bar  ] . 
[LOC U.S.  ] participants for the [PER Arad  ] and [PER Gal  ] meetings included Political Counselor [PER Marc Sievers  ] , [ORG T Senior Advisor  ] [PER James Timbie  ] , [ORG NSC  ] 's [PER Adam Scheinman  ] , and political military officer [PER Jason Grubb  ] . 
[PER U/S Tauscher  ] met for dinner with [ORG Israel Atomic Energy Commission  ] ( [ORG IAEC  ] ) and [ORG MFA  ] senior officials on December 1 , including [ORG IAEC  ] Director General [PER Saul Chorev  ] , Deputy Director General [PER David Danieli  ] , and Director for Policy and Arms Control Merav Zefary-Odiz , as well as [ORG MFA  ] DDG Bar and Director for Arms Control [PER Rodica Radian-Gordon  ] . 
On December 2 , [PER U/S Tauscher  ] met for breakfast with [ORG MOD Political-Military  ] Chief [PER Amos Gilad  ] ; [LOC U.S.  ] attendees included [MISC Charge D'Affaires  ] [PER Luis Moreno  ] , [PER Timbie  ] , [PER Scheinman  ] , and [PER Grubb  ] . 
Arms Control/Nonproliferation Agenda ------------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In various meetings with [ORG GOI  ] interlocutors , [PER U/S Tauscher  ] outlined an ambitious arms control and nonproliferation agenda , beginning with the President 's [LOC Prague  ] speech , and including other priorities such as a follow-on to [MISC START  ] , [MISC CTBT  ] ratification , the upcoming [ORG NPT Review Conference  ] , and negotiating the [MISC FMCT  ] . 
She noted that negotiations with [LOC Moscow  ] on [MISC START  ] were slow to develop in part due to delayed confirmations and [MISC Russian  ] wariness . 
But [PER U/S Tauscher  ] expected a [MISC START  ] follow-on -- including a strong verification regime -- soon. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG National Security Advisor Arad  ] described President [PER Obama  ] 's arms control and nonproliferation agenda as " daunting and challenging . 
" He reaffirmed that the [ORG GOI  ] will participate in the April 2010 Nuclear Security summit in [LOC Washington  ] , noting that PM [PER Netanyahu  ] planned to attend the summit as discussed between President [PER Obama  ] and PM [PER Netanyahu  ] during their recent one-on-one meeting in [LOC Washington  ] . 
[ORG GOI Nuclear Summit  ] Sherpa [PER Gil Reich  ] noted , however , that the Holocaust memorial day in [LOC Israel  ] might be a potential scheduling conflict with the summit . 
[PER Arad  ] expressed appreciation for the summit , noting that if the initiative had been pursued ten years previously , perhaps proliferation cases such as [PER AQ Khan  ] might have been prevented or at least controlled . 
He wished the [LOC United States  ] success negotiating with the [MISC Russians  ] on [MISC START.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Due to the [LOC U.S.  ] administration 's prioritization of arms control and nonproliferation , [PER Arad  ] also noted that the [ORG GOI  ] had recently reconvened a high level committee on these issues comprised of [ORG GOI  ] officials and experts from outside the government . 
He noted that the committee had been formed during President [PER George Herbert Walker Bush  ] 's administration to analyze treaties such as the [ORG CWC  ] and [MISC CTBT  ] , but stopped meeting in 2007 . 
[PER U/S Tauscher  ] expressed interest in meeting with the group during her next visit to [LOC Israel  ] ; [PER Arad  ] took the request on board . 
[LOC Egypt  ] and the [ORG NPT  ] ----------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) On the [ORG NPT  ] , [PER U/S Tauscher  ] reiterated the importance of a successful [ORG Review Conference  ] -- including hopefully a consensus resolution . 
She raised [LOC U.S.  ] concerns over potential [MISC Egyptian  ] actions at the [ORG RevCon  ] , based on previous decades of behavior and " 10-15 year-old talking points . 
" [PER U/S Tauscher  ] said the [LOC United States  ] is not " naive " with respect to [LOC Egypt  ] ; nevertheless , the [LOC United States  ] must make a sincere , good faith effort to create the conditions for a positive [ORG RevCon  ] -- this might include small steps with [LOC Israel  ] to address some of [LOC Egypt  ] 's desire to demonstrate progress in implementation of the 1995 resolution on a region free of weapons of mass destruction. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) That said , [PER U/S Tauscher  ] reiterated that the [LOC United States  ] would consult and coordinate with [LOC Israel  ] , and would take no action that might compromise [LOC Israel  ] 's security . 
She noted that the [LOC United States  ] would like to elevate the [ORG NPT RevCon  ] issue to President [PER Mubarak  ] at an appropriate time , and expressed interest in developing an alternate communication track to [PER Mubarak  ] to circumvent the [ORG MFA  ] , potentially through [MISC Egyptian  ] Intelligence Minister [PER LTG Suleiman  ] . 
[PER U/S Tauscher  ] said her message to [LOC Cairo  ] will be " very tough , " and that [MISC Egyptian  ] obstructionist behavior linking [LOC Israel  ] to [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program is not helping [LOC Egypt.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Arad  ] said relations with [LOC Egypt  ] were " relatively good , " describing continued dialogue between PM [PER Netanyahu  ] and President [PER Mubarak  ] , and strong channels of communication at other levels . 
In many respects , he said [LOC Israel  ] 's relations with [LOC Egypt  ] are almost as good as during PM [PER Rabin  ] 's time . 
[PER Arad  ] said [LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC Israel  ] do not see " eye-to-eye " on some issues such as [LOC Gaza  ] and the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] , but otherwise relations are strong. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Arad  ] described the [MISC Egyptian  ] [ORG MFA  ] , however , as a " nagging problem " in the relationship , particularly regarding the [LOC Middle East  ] [ORG NWFZ  ] issue , and noted [LOC Cairo  ] 's refusal to talk to [PER FM Lieberman  ] . 
Other [ORG GOI  ] officials expressed exasperation over [MISC Egyptian  ] motivations on the [ORG NWFZ  ] ; [PER Reich  ] raised [MISC Egyptian  ] behavior at the latest [ORG IAEA General Conference  ] , as well as [LOC Cairo  ] 's negative reaction to the [ORG IAEA Board  ] of Governor 's recent statement on [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Arad  ] said [LOC Israel  ] has supported a regional [ORG NWFZ  ] as far back as 1992 , provided [LOC Israel  ] enjoyed peaceful relations with its neighbors . 
He said the [ORG GOI  ] has spoken frankly with [LOC Cairo  ] , noting that such behavior is not helpful , and is misdirecting focus away from [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG MOD Political-Military  ] Chief [PER Amos Gilad  ] said [LOC Egypt  ] understands that [LOC Iran  ] is the real threat to the region , noting that a nuclear weapon-armed [LOC Iran  ] is a redline for [LOC Cairo  ] . 
He averred that [LOC Egypt  ] does not accept that [LOC Iran  ] will become a superpower , but remains afraid of its own domestic political situation post-Mubarak . 
[PER Gilad  ] expressed succession concerns , noting that [PER Mubarak  ] is " approaching the past more quickly than the future . 
" He added that [PER Mubarak  ] does not have confidence in [MISC Egyptian  ] Foreign Minister [PER Aboul Gheit.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG MFA  ] Deputy Director General for [ORG Strategic Affairs Alon Bar  ] outlined repeated attempts by the [ORG GOI  ] to engage with the [MISC Egyptian  ] [ORG MFA  ] , but to no avail . 
He described [MISC Egyptian  ] actions linking [LOC Israel  ] to [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program in the [ORG IAEA  ] as " not encouraging , " and questioned how to convince [LOC Egypt  ] to drop this " obsession " over the [ORG NWFZ  ] . 
[ORG Israel Atomic Energy Commission  ] ( [ORG IAEC  ] ) Director General [PER Saul Chorev  ] and Arms Control Director [PER Merav Zefary-Odiz  ] speculated that [LOC Egypt  ] feels challenged by [MISC Iranian  ] attempts to acquire nuclear weapons , and includes [LOC Israel  ] in any public attack on [LOC Tehran  ] in order to give [LOC Cairo  ] coverage from regional criticism . 
[ORG Bar  ] argued that the [MISC Egyptian  ] [ORG MFA  ] raises [LOC Israel  ] 's nuclear program as a " wedge issue " in order to prevent better relations between [LOC Israel  ] and others in the region . 
[ORG IAEC  ] Deputy Director General [PER David Danieli  ] concurred , noting that [LOC Egypt  ] can use the nuclear issue to put [LOC Israel  ] " in a corner " while benefiting from positive relations between the two countries. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Zefary-Odiz  ] also reviewed her participation in an [ORG International Commission  ] on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament conference in September 2009 in [LOC Cairo  ] . 
She described the conference as " very confrontational , " and that it was clear [LOC Israel  ] was targeted by [MISC Egyptian  ] interlocutors . 
[PER Zefary-Odiz  ] acknowledged that the [ORG GOI  ] had anticipated such behavior , and contemplated skipping the conference . 
She noted that [MISC Egyptian  ] officials also lambasted [MISC Iranian  ] participants , but were always careful to include [LOC Israel  ] and [LOC Iran  ] in the same sentence. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Arad  ] said the [ORG GOI  ] will take their cue from [LOC U.S  ] . 
" heavy-lifting " : if there is a small step -- " not a concession , " he stressed -- that [LOC Israel  ] could take to help facilitate , then the [ORG GOI  ] would consider it . 
He noted that the [ORG GOI  ] wanted to see a " reversal of trends " from [LOC Egypt  ] regarding [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program -- after all , it is in [LOC Egypt  ] 's interest to do so . 
He said [LOC Israel  ] continues to have reservations regarding the [ORG NPT  ] -- following nuclear pursuits by [LOC Libya  ] , [LOC Syria  ] , and [LOC Iran  ] , it is clear to the [ORG GOI  ] that the [ORG NPT  ] is not sufficient and must be strengthened . 
The goal of the [ORG NPT  ] , he stressed , should not be to " prevent the next [LOC Iran  ] , but to stop [LOC Iran  ] in order to prevent the next [LOC Iran  ] " from occurring. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Chorev  ] speculated that [LOC Egypt  ] will aim to ruin the [ORG RevCon  ] . 
[ORG Bar  ] said the [MISC Egyptians  ] have not been held accountable for past bad behavior at the [ORG NPT RevCon  ] -- " they have never paid the price . 
" He noted that [LOC Cairo  ] knows the importance the [LOC United States  ] attaches to a successful [ORG RevCon  ] , and therefore will try to leverage a " high price " in order not to ruin it . 
He noted similar tactics with regard to [LOC Egypt  ] 's counter-smuggling efforts along the border with [MISC Gaza.  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Timbie outlined several small steps that might address [MISC Egyptian  ] concerns and demonstrate progress in implementation of the 1995 resolution and the [LOC Middle East  ] NWFZ: an [ORG IAEA  ] forum on the experience of other regional NWFZs ; a special coordinator or rappateur on 1995 resolution implementation ; a statement from the [LOC United States  ] , [LOC United Kingdom  ] and [LOC Russia  ] reiterating the importance of the 1995 resolution ; and exploring text with [LOC Israel  ] and [LOC Egypt  ] on universality and compliance. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Gilad  ] questioned these steps from a " tactical/strategic " context , and suggested this was not a tactical matter . 
He argued against creating the impression that [LOC Israel  ] was the problem . 
Instead , [PER Gilad  ] recommended a strategic , traditional approach -- concessions will only be used by [LOC Egypt  ] as leverage . 
He suggested the [LOC United States  ] remind [LOC Egypt  ] of its special relationship based on [LOC U.S.  ] support , and reaffirm that [LOC Iran  ] is the " bad guy . 
" [PER Gilad  ] said [LOC Egypt  ] should also be reminded that most countries in the region agree with the [ORG NWFZ  ] concept in principle ; the [MISC Egyptian  ] [ORG MFA  ] 's insistence on an immediate [ORG NWFZ  ] neither fits the current political reality nor makes sense as it diverts focus from [MISC Iranian  ] intransigence . 
He noted that [LOC Egypt  ] listens to the [LOC United States  ] ; it is therefore important to speak clearly and directly when taking the issue to [ORG Mubarak.  ] <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Chorev  ] and [PER Zefary-Odiz  ] argued these steps had been tried in the past -- and had failed . 
[PER Danieli  ] questioned why [LOC Israel  ] should take any steps at all . 
Based on experience at the [ORG IAEA  ] and the [ORG UN First Committee  ] on Disarmament and [ORG International Security  ] , he said " nothing satisfies [LOC Egypt  ] " as [LOC Cairo  ] " pockets every concession " and demands more -- " it 's a slippery slope . 
" [PER Danieli  ] said [LOC Israel  ] will not " play by [LOC Egypt  ] 's rules . 
" [ORG Bar  ] concurred , noting that [LOC Egypt  ] will " raise the bar , " and begin negotiations with these small steps as the baseline -- he was skeptical such steps would prove helpful. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Arad  ] characterized these steps as " talking endlessly " -- that is " not progress , " he said . 
He was uncomfortable discussing [LOC Israel  ] [ORG NPT  ] compliance , especially as [LOC Israel  ] is not a party to the treaty . 
He also raised concerns regarding the definition of the [LOC Middle East  ] [ORG NWFZ  ] -- did it also include [LOC Pakistan  ] , [LOC India  ] and [LOC Iran  ] , for example ? 
[PER Arad  ] said such questions should be posed to [LOC Cairo  ] -- if [LOC Egypt  ] is willing to include [LOC Pakistan  ] in its definition of a [LOC Middle East  ] [ORG NWFZ  ] , then we can take that as a signal that [LOC Cairo  ] is ready for a serious conversation on the matter. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Zefary-Odiz  ] argued that the [ORG NPT  ] as a " global solution " is not appropriate in the current political realities of the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
Due to the region 's prior track record of [ORG NPT  ] non-compliance , she said a gradual , step-by-step process employing confidence building measures be used to improve relations between neighbors . 
[ORG NPT  ] partner obligations should be enhanced , not reduced , she said . 
[PER Zefary-Odiz  ] noted that only after peaceful relations are established can arms control measures be pursued , starting with conventional weapons and later focusing on chemical/biological/nuclear arms . 
She said that [LOC Egypt  ] and other [MISC Arab  ] states de-link comprehensive peace from arms control measures -- [LOC Israel  ] views these elements as inseparable and sequential. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) On a related note , [PER Chorev  ] asked if [LOC Israel  ] should attend the [ORG RevCon  ] as an observer . 
[PER U/S Tauscher  ] and Timbie replied that the decision was ultimately the [ORG GOI  ] 's to make , but offered to raise the issue in [LOC Washington  ] . 
[PER Chorev  ] noted that [LOC Israel  ] would be careful not to " make any noise , " and could play a positive , consultative role . 
On the other hand , [PER Danieli  ] acknowledged the argument that as a non-party , perhaps it was not appropriate for [LOC Israel  ] to attend . 
[LOC Iran  ] ---- <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER U/S Tauscher  ] said the [LOC United States  ] was very concerned about the recently announced [MISC Iranian  ] plans to build ten additional uranium enrichment facilities . 
She reiterated the two track strategy of persuasion and pressure , and noted that the time for persuasion is " waning . 
" [PER U/S Tauscher  ] said the [LOC United States  ] has " created the coalition " it had hoped for , and was happy to see the recent [ORG IAEA  ] BOG 's resolution transferred to the [LOC UNSC.  ] <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER U/S Tauscher  ] noted that the [LOC United States  ] was working hard through the [ORG P5  ] 1 process to encourage [MISC Russian  ] and [MISC Chinese  ] cooperation to counter continued [MISC Iranian  ] intransigence and inflammatory rhetoric -- [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC China  ] are " lynch pins , " she said . 
She noted that [LOC Russia  ] had worked closely with the [LOC United States  ] on the [ORG Tehran Research Reactor  ] ( [ORG TRR  ] ) proposal , which [LOC Moscow  ] considered an " elegant solution , " -- but [LOC Iran  ] had not agreed . 
Keeping [LOC Russia  ] engaged , [PER U/S Tauscher  ] explained , also means [MISC Chinese  ] cooperation. <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) MOD Political-Military Chief [PER Amos Gilad  ] described recent [MISC Russian  ] cooperation on [LOC Iran  ] as encouraging , but expressed reservations that [LOC Russia  ] would join in any sanctions against [LOC Iran  ] . 
He explained that [LOC Moscow  ] has raised the provision of sophisticated [MISC Israeli  ] unmanned aerial vehicle ( [ORG UAV  ] ) technology in exchange for canceling the [MISC S-300  ] sale to [LOC Tehran  ] . 
[PER Gilad  ] said that [MISC Russian  ] interlocutors had acknowledged development gaps in their [ORG UAV  ] platform , and is prepared to pay USD one billion for [MISC Israeli  ] [ORG UAV  ] technology . 
He reiterated that [LOC Israel  ] will not provide its latest [ORG UAV  ] technology , arguing that such technology would likely end up in the hands of the [MISC Chinese.  ] <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Arad  ] said the [ORG GOI  ] appreciated the United [MISC States'  ] efforts regarding [LOC Iran  ] , noting how hard the [LOC United States  ] has worked to build an alliance . 
He pointed to the recent [ORG IAEA Board  ] of Governor 's resolution as a successful example of [LOC U.S.  ] efforts . 
Regarding the [LOC Qom  ] facility , [PER Arad  ] said the [ORG GOI  ] was not surprised by [LOC Tehran  ] 's " chutzpah . 
" He described a high degree of alertness in [LOC Israel  ] , and added that the [ORG GOI  ] studies daily [MISC Iranian  ] posturing and boastful announcements in an attempt to discern [MISC Iranian  ] intentions . 
[PER Arad  ] commented that the trends are bad , as [LOC Iran  ] continues to accumulate low enriched uranium. <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG MFA  ] DG Gal said there was not much difference in the national intelligence estimations ( [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC UK  ] , [LOC France  ] , and [LOC Russia  ] ) regarding [LOC Iran  ] . 
He said the [ORG GOI  ] takes " very seriously " [MISC Iranian  ] plans for ten new enrichment facilities -- " time is of the essence , " and " now is the time to implement crippling sanctions , " he added . 
Gal likened the case for enhanced sanctions to prescribed antibiotics from a doctor -- one must take the full course of antibiotics for the prescribed period of time , or they will not work. <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Turning to his crystal ball , [PER Gilad  ] was not sure [LOC Tehran  ] had decided it wants a nuclear weapon -- but is " determined " to obtain the option to build one . 
He acknowledged that the engagement strategy is a good idea -- " as long as you understand that it will not work . 
" [PER Gilad  ] said it should be clear by February 2010 that engagement as a option has failed -- the imposition of " crippling sanctions " for the February/March/April timeframe is crucial . 
He said [MISC Russian  ] cooperation will be the key , and the current [MISC Russian  ] cooperative mind-set cannot necessarily be counted on in several weeks time . 
By June of next year , [PER Gilad  ] said it should be clear whether sanctions have worked . 
However , given [LOC Tehran  ] 's clandestine nuclear program ( e.g. , [LOC Qom  ] ) , he said it will not be clear when [LOC Iran  ] has reached the " point of no return " -- he doubted [LOC Iran  ] will choose to let it overtly known that it has produced a nuclear weapon . 
[ORG FMCT  ] and [MISC CTBT  ] ------------- <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG IAEC  ] DG [PER Chorev  ] raised the [ORG FMCT  ] 's future in the [MISC Conference on Disarmament  ] . 
[PER U/S Tauscher  ] acknowledged frustration with [LOC Pakistan  ] , and noted that while [LOC Washington  ] places a high priority on the [ORG FMCT  ] , other efforts like a START follow-on and the [MISC CTBT  ] will come first . 
Timbie added that it will take some time to negotiate an [MISC FMCT.  ] <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Chorev  ] asked about the current prospects for [MISC CTBT  ] ratification in the [ORG Senate  ] . 
[PER U/S Tauscher  ] noted that the START follow-on was a higher priority , and said the [ORG Senate  ] will likely focus on the Law of the [LOC Sea  ] treaty before turning its attention to the [MISC CTBT  ] . 
She pointed to mid-term [ORG Congressional  ] elections in 2010 , and explained that focusing on the [MISC CTBT  ] in 2011 might be more prudent given the controversy associated with the treaty . 
[PER U/S Tauscher  ] explained the necessity of making the case for the [MISC CTBT  ] , and hoped to build political momentum in favor of the treaty through the release of the [ORG Nuclear Posture Review  ] , a new national intelligence estimate , and the handover on the stockpile stewardship program. <a id='par29' href='#par29'>¶</a>29 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Chorev  ] asked that the [LOC United States  ] consult with the [ORG GOI  ] on the [MISC CTBT  ] , where he said [LOC Israel  ] could be " more flexible than the [ORG FMCT  ] . 
" [PER U/S Tauscher  ] asked if the [ORG GOI  ] might be willing to make affirmative statements in support of the [MISC CTBT  ] ; [PER Chorev  ] made no promises , but suspected such a statement might be possible -- especially if it would help with [ORG Senate  ] ratification. <a id='par30' href='#par30'>¶</a>30 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Chorev  ] described the [ORG FMCT  ] as " very difficult " for [LOC Israel  ] . 
Scheinman confirmed that negotiations would be based on the 2006 draft [ORG FMCT  ] text , with an added verification regime that is being worked on -- he described the verification regime 's definitions as " critical " in that regard . 
[PER Danieli  ] questioned the [ORG FMCT  ] 's added value , arguing that it would have little impact . 
He asked who was the [ORG FMCT  ] 's real target -- [LOC India  ] , [LOC Pakistan  ] or even [LOC Israel  ] ? 
[ORG Jordanian Nuclear Reactor  ] ------------------------- <a id='par31' href='#par31'>¶</a>31 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG IAEC  ] DG [PER Chorev  ] raised [MISC Jordanian  ] plans to build a nuclear reactor . 
He said the [ORG GOI  ] has decided not to oppose the reactor , and have offered the [MISC Jordanians Israeli  ] expertise on where best to build it . 
[PER Chorev  ] said the [ORG IAEC  ] formed a steering committee with its [MISC Jordanian  ] counterpart comprised of three working groups focusing on safety , geological surveys , and water issues . 
[PER Chorev  ] said the steering committee first met in [LOC Amman  ] in June 2009 , and is waiting to convene again . 
[PER Danieli  ] stressed that the [ORG GOI  ] does not want to hamper the [MISC Jordanian  ] nuclear plans , but added that [LOC Israel  ] has concerns about border issues and security associated with the reactor . 
Timbie said the [LOC United States  ] is pushing [LOC Jordan  ] to sign a 123 Agreement along the same lines as the recent agreement signed with [LOC UAE  ] , only stronger . 
[MISC Zefary-Odiz  ] noted that [LOC Egypt  ] is putting tremendous pressure on [LOC Jordan  ] not to accept a 123 Agreement . 
[ORG QME  ] --- <a id='par32' href='#par32'>¶</a>32 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER U/S Tauscher  ] reiterated the United [MISC States'  ] strong commitment to [LOC Israel  ] 's [ORG Qualitative Military Edge  ] ( [ORG QME  ] ) , and expressed appreciation for the [ORG GOI  ] 's willingness to work with us through the newly created [ORG QME  ] working groups . 
Both MOD Pol-Mil Chief [PER Gilad  ] and [ORG MFA  ] DDG Bar commended the newly created [ORG QME  ] working groups , and asked they be scheduled to convene as soon as possible. <a id='par33' href='#par33'>¶</a>33 .
