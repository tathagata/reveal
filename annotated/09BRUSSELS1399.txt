( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG SUMMARY:  ] The [ORG EU  ] Commissioner for Development and [ORG Humanitarian Aid  ] , [ORG Karel de Gucht  ] , along with the [ORG Swedish International Development Cooperation  ] Minister [PER Gunilla Carlsson  ] , traveled to [LOC Zimbabwe  ] on 12-13 September with an [ORG EU  ] delegation including representatives of the [ORG Council , Commission  ] , and the current and future Presidencies . 
While there , they met with President [PER Mugabe  ] , Prime Minister [PER Morgan Tsvangirai  ] , the Foreign and [LOC Justice Ministers  ] , and civil society members . 
They then traveled to [LOC South Africa  ] where they met with Deputy Prime Minister [PER Mutambara  ] . 
[LOC POLOFF  ] , along with [MISC Canadian  ] and [MISC Australian  ] counterparts , met with [PER Louis Amorim  ] of the [ORG Council Secretariat  ] on September 18 , and then with [PER Maud Arnould  ] and [PER John Clancy  ] from Commissioner de Gucht’s Cabinet on October 1 to discuss the visit , the status of the [MISC Global Peace Agreement  ] ( [ORG GPA  ] ) , the [ORG Government of National Unity  ] , sanctions and the way forward . 
END SUMMARY ATMOSPHERICS: ------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG EU  ] delegation saw the visit as a success because it drew media attention back onto [LOC Zimbabwe  ] . 
This was the first high-level [ORG EU  ] visit since 2002 , and the [ORG GOZ  ] made a real effort . 
But Mugabe’s anti-Western rhetoric continued in the press , including public statements about “Bloody Whites” coming to interfere with their internal affairs . 
The Foreign Minister told the delegation not to worry as the remarks were simply playing to the domestic constituency . 
The meetings were very political and not at all technical . 
There were huge differences of opinion , but open discussions , even with President [PER Mugabe  ] . 
MEETING WITH [PER MUGABE  ] ------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) President [PER Robert Mugabe  ] was willing to engage , which the delegation took as a positive , but not willing to give an inch . 
[PER Mugabe  ] acknowledged the important role the [ORG British Labor Party  ] ( plus the [MISC Swedish  ] , [MISC German  ] and [MISC Danish  ] ) had in helping [LOC Zimbabwe  ] achieve independence . 
He clearly wanted to be conciliatory here , particularly toward the [MISC Swedes  ] . 
Then he returned to the theme of a [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC U.K.  ] conspiracy to overthrow him. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The delegation expressed concern about slow reforms , the status of the [ORG GPA  ] , and continuing political violence . 
[PER Mugabe  ] resisted it all claiming , for example , that the only violence today consists of small incidents involving youths . 
The [ORG Movement for Democratic Change  ] party ( [ORG MDC  ] ) , he added , is also full of violent youths . 
In response , the [MISC Swedish  ] Minister was polite but very straightforward saying , “We don’t share those views , even if it could be a question of perception.” When pressed , [PER Mugabe  ] would say , “I will do the right things and I will avoid the wrong things.” <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Throughout , [PER Mugabe  ] was a superb debater , always looking for proof and asking his underlings regarding details . 
( [PER NOTE: Clancy  ] advised it is better to stay out of the weeds when trying to make points to [PER Mugabe  ] because “he will turn details against you.” END NOTE ) [PER Mugabe  ] stated the [ORG GPA  ] has been completely implemented and the [ORG Unity Government  ] was working well , so sanctions should be lifted . 
He claimed there was an independent judiciary in [LOC Zimbabwe  ] , so the fate of imprisoned [ORG MDC  ] Minister [PER Roy Bennett  ] was not in his hands . 
He claimed no knowledge of other arrested parliamentarians and turned to his Chief of Intelligence for details , who also claimed to know nothing . 
Ignoring the view of the [ORG Southern African Development Community  ] ( [ORG SADC  ] ) that certain appointments , such as the [ORG Central Bank  ] Governor and Attorney General , must be made by the [ORG Unity Government  ] , [PER Mugabe  ] claims those appointments could not be deemed unilateral because he was not required to consult . 
He admonished the delegation not to let themselves be manipulated by the opposition on these topics. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Mugabe  ] stated that land reform was an irreversible decision . 
He said he was not completely against some kind of land ownership system , and a leasing idea , “does not shock him.” He argued that resolving the land issues would require a comprehensive land survey , for which [LOC Zimbabwe  ] would need [LOC BRUSSELS  ] 00001399 002 OF 004 financial and human resources . 
The direct implication was that unless donors provide the resources , the [ORG GOZ  ] is not going to do it . 
( NOTE: In a later meeting , the Foreign and [LOC Justice Ministers  ] repeated these points , adding the threatening comment , “This is the one issue about which people take up arms.” END NOTE ) IMPRESSIONS OF [PER MUGABE  ] --------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Our [ORG EU  ] interlocutors said [PER Mugabe  ] appeared physically fit , mentally sharp , and “charming.” When asked if his position had either weakened or been consolidated , [PER Amorim  ] answered that it was very strong . 
He remains powerful but is clearly surrounded by hardliners who are “dodgy , ” “cold , ” and lack Mugabe’s intelligence . 
( [PER NOTE: Mutambara  ] cautioned the delegation not to be fooled into thinking that [PER Mugabe  ] was being lead by hard-liners , saying , “He is the worst hardliner there is.” END NOTE ) <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) In both meetings with our [ORG EU  ] interlocutors , they told the same illustrative anecdote: during the delegation’s meeting with [PER Mugabe  ] , a strong , young man entered with a bowl and pitcher of water on a silver tray . 
He knelt in front of [PER Mugabe  ] , who made a show of washing his hands with this subservient man at his feet . 
The delegation thought [PER Mugabe  ] intended it as a show of his strength and power , but instead , as [PER Clancy  ] put it , “it showed that [PER Mugabe  ] has lost the plot of normal human interaction and the responsibility of leaders toward their people.” MEETING WITH TSVANGIRAI: CHALLENGES AND PRIORITIES --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The delegation then went to [LOC Bulawayo  ] and met with Prime Minister [PER Morgan Tsvangirai  ] and separately with Minister of Education [PER David Coltart  ] . 
[PER Tsvangirai  ] was much more positive in [LOC Brussels  ] in June about the [ORG GPA  ] than he was in this meeting . 
He gave a structured , concise description of challenges and priorities . 
The challenges included the disputed appointments of the Attorney General and [ORG Central Bank  ] Governor . 
He blamed the latter for the complete economic meltdown and said , “We cannot have him there.” XXXXXXXXXXXX END NOTE ) <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Tsvangirai  ] discussed political harassment , particularly the serious accusations against [PER Roy Bennett  ] . 
The fact that he is “white” matters , [PER Tsvangirai  ] said , since [MISC ZANU-PF  ] is concerned that [PER Bennett  ] will defend the white farmers . 
[PER Tsvangirai  ] said the spirit of the [ORG Unity Government  ] is threatened by [MISC ZANU-PF  ] . 
He insisted there is no alternative to the [ORG Unity Government  ] , but added that he did not know “how much longer we can take this.” He is very disappointed that the [ORG SADC  ] extraordinary session on [LOC Zimbabwe  ] did not happen , and that there has been little progress since June . 
Minister [PER Carlsson  ] asked if there was a risk of the [ORG Unity Government  ] collapsing , and he said “no.” <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) As for priorities , he highlighted that the [ORG MDC  ] heads all the ministries that promote the population’s well-being , such as education , health , and housing , among others . 
[ORG MDC  ] was originally unhappy with the distribution , especially with [MISC ZANU-PF’s  ] control of all the “hard” sectors , but then saw that the only resources coming from outside supporters were for service provision . 
If [ORG MDC  ] can make its sectors work ( through aid or other means ) , they can make the [ORG Unity Government  ] work , and people will see a difference in their lives . 
[PER Amorim  ] noted that Tsvangirai’s analysis seems accurate . 
Everyone he spoke with who was not a government official confirmed that things are better - schools are open and stores have food . 
[PER Tsvangirai  ] remains concerned about food security , however . 
He explained the goal of providing one million homes with seeds and fertilizer , saying they had already done half and asked the [ORG EU  ] to fund the rest . 
MEETING WITH [PER MUTAMBARA  ] ---------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Deputy Prime Minister [PER Mutambara  ] impressed [PER Amorim  ] as being “very sharp , young , engaging , and very , very dangerous.” [PER Arnould  ] said [PER Mutambara  ] was a “strong personality” who was talking for the camera - he made a long [LOC BRUSSELS  ] 00001399 003 OF 004 speech to the press about the importance of his faction in the government , and the imperative to lift sanctions . 
[PER Mutambara  ] was livid that the [LOC United States  ] met with [PER Mugabe  ] and [PER Tsvangirai  ] but did not meet with him . 
[PER Amorim  ] summarized [MISC Mutambara’s  ] main message to the delegation as , “You have to count me in . 
If you do not include me , I can wreck this.” He claimed he was “the only one who can shut up [PER Mugabe  ] , ” and that everyone else is afraid of him . 
When asked if others in the government shared [MISC Mutambara’s  ] assessment of his importance , [PER Amorim  ] replied that while [PER Mutambara  ] only has three seats , they tipped the balance and allowed the [ORG MDC  ] to claim a majority . 
[PER Mutambara  ] knows that he could pull out and destroy the whole thing . 
[PER Mutambara  ] stated that he considers the [ORG SADC  ] communique of January to be part of the [ORG GPA  ] and implementation will not be complete without it . 
He sees the [ORG GPA  ] as irreversible , “there is no Plan B.” MEETINGS WITH FOREIGN AND JUSTICE MINISTERS , [ORG CIVIL SOCIETY  ] --------------------------------------------- ------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Back in [LOC Harare  ] on Sunday morning , the delegation also met with Foreign Minister [PER Samuel Mumbengegwi  ] and Justice Minister [PER Patrick Chinamasa  ] who were described as playing good cop and bad cop , respectively . 
The Foreign Minister was conciliatory , describing the visit as a crucial step to normalization . 
The Justice Minister was confrontational , asking , “Who are you to tell us how to run our business ? ” and saying , “listening to you and listening to [PER Tsvangirai  ] is the same thing.” The delegation had the impression it was hard for them not to have all the control and to have [MISC Europeans  ] “telling them what to do.” <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) In meetings with [ORG Civil Society  ] leaders , they talked of continued violence in the rural areas by [MISC ZANU-PF  ] , but also by [ORG MDC  ] . 
In urban areas , there have been fragile gains on human rights , including press freedom , but it depends on Ministerial tolerance . 
It could all vanish tomorrow because the laws remain unchanged . 
( Note: [PER Tsvangirai  ] and [PER Biti  ] said that they want to see the [ORG Property Rights Act  ] , the [ORG Freedom of Media Act  ] , and the [ORG Public Order Act  ] all passed in the next six months . 
END NOTE ) But on constitutional reform , there is deadlock . 
The July meeting started ominously , with participants nearly coming to blows , and [MISC ZANU-PF  ] members saying they would not participate because [ORG MDC  ] members were getting paid and they were not . 
SANCTIONS --------- 15 ( C ) Sanctions were discussed in all meetings with government officials . 
[PER Mugabe  ] portrayed the [LOC West  ] as unfairly targeting people in the [ORG Unity Government  ] for no reason. “What do you expect but hostility when you expel the children of my collaborators from universities in your countries ? 
This hurts us.” He uses the sanctions in the media , saying , “You are making the people of [LOC Zimbabwe  ] suffer , trying to force regime change from the outside.” [PER Clancy  ] noted , “One would think that sanctions would be a gadfly to him - nothing more than annoying . 
But they bother him enormously because they do not apply to the [MISC MDC.”  ] The officials with [PER Mugabe  ] stated that the targeted travel measures do not matter , but indicated the measures against parastatals do . 
Unsurprisingly , [PER Tsvangirai  ] does not want sanctions lifted . 
He says the process needs to be a two-way street , so there is no reason to lift them when there has been no progress. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) Out of the three , [PER Mutambara  ] spoke the most about sanctions and claimed they only help [PER Mugabe  ] . 
Without sanctions , he said , the [ORG GPA  ] could move ahead , as [PER Mugabe  ] would have no excuse . 
( [PER NOTE:  ] Considering that [PER Mugabe  ] claims the [ORG GPA  ] is finished , the delegation did not share this assessment . 
END NOTE ) [PER Mutambara  ] asserted that the [LOC West  ] must follow the advice of [LOC Africa  ] leaders. “If Zuma says so , then you should not bat an eye.” He seemed surprised to hear from the delegation that [PER Tsvangirai  ] did not agree . 
[PER Mutambara  ] said that any progress would require considerable engagement with [ORG Zuma.  ] “You must get [MISC African  ] leaders to put pressure on [PER Mugabe  ] . 
He will not listen to you.” <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) The [MISC Zimbabwean  ] Ministers said the [ORG African Union  ] and [ORG SADC  ] have asked that the sanctions be lifted , so “why don’t you listen to them ? ” Minister [PER Carlsson  ] asked how they reconcile asking for respect for [MISC SADC’s  ] views on sanctions when the [ORG GOZ  ] had pulled out of the [ORG SADC Tribunal  ] because of its views ( a reference to the case brought by [PER Mike Campbell  ] , a white farmer ) . 
Displaying a capacity to “create reality” [LOC BRUSSELS  ] 00001399 004 OF 004 ( Amorim’s words ) , the Ministers gave a very legalistic response ending with , “the [ORG Tribunal  ] does not exist.” WHAT’S NEXT ? ------------ <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [PER Arnould  ] stated that [MISC ZANU-PF  ] is rebuilding and needs money , but time is on their side . 
( She mentioned [MISC ZANU-PF  ] has an arrangement with the [MISC Iranians  ] to supply oil . 
) Asked about the way forward , [PER Amorim  ] said the [ORG EU  ] is committed to the plan for the dual roadmaps ( in which the [ORG GOZ  ] prepares a roadmap for [ORG GPA  ] implementation , and [ORG EU Heads of Mission  ] prepare one for normalizing relations ; then they would link the two ) . 
He stressed that the [ORG GOZ  ] must accept the need to deal with the [ORG Member States’ Heads of Mission  ] in [LOC Harare  ] on this , not always with Ministers from capitals . 
The delegation’s message was that they support the people of [LOC Zimbabwe  ] and will continue to do so , just not necessarily by going through the government . 
The current visit should not be taken to imply that things are fine now . 
It’s a long-term process . 
They sent the very strong message that the reluctance of the [ORG GOZ  ] to engage in the roadmap is matched by [MISC European  ] reluctance . 
Nothing has moved in [LOC Harare  ] , so the [ORG EU  ] sees no reason to move from their current position. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) In response to Prime Minister Tsvangirai’s 16 October remarks on the lack of political progress in [LOC Zimbabwe  ] , Commissioner [PER de Gucht  ] issued a statement outlining again the absolute necessity for all parties to implement the [ORG GPA  ] without further delay . 
[PER De Gucht  ] encouraged key regional bodies , particularly [ORG SADC  ] , to do all they can to assist the parties to the [ORG GPA  ] to resolve their differences for the benefit of the [MISC Zimbabwean  ] people .
