<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L ACCRA 000131 SIPDIS DDEPT FOR AF/RSA-POMMERER , [ORG INL/AAE-ALTON  ] , AND DS/T/ATA-GONZALES EO 12958 DECL: 02/18/2019 TAGS PGOV , [ORG SOCI  ] , [ORG ASEC  ] , [ORG KCRM  ] , [ORG SNAR  ] , GH SUBJECT: ACCRA RESPONSE: ASSESSMENT ON THE NEED FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND JUDICIAL TRAINING REF: A. STATE 05448 [PER B. STATE  ] 09536 Classified By: DCM SKBROWN for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [ORG Ghana’s  ] law enforcement and judicial sectors have a wide range of training needs , from basic criminal investigation to intelligence and surveillance techniques . 
In September 2008 post hosted a State/INL interagency team which assessed to [ORG Ghana’s  ] counter-narcotics capabilities . 
The [MISC Mission’s  ] response concurs in significant ways with the conclusions of the assessment team ( Reftel B ) , including the need for a vetted [ORG CN  ] unit within [ORG Ghana’s  ] law enforcement community . 
The sections below provide responses to the questions asked in Reftel A. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) What are the key internal or regional challenges the host government’s non-military security apparatus confronts ? 
[LOC Ghana  ] faces significant and growing challenges on the issue of narcotics . 
The country has become a transshipment point for cocaine from [LOC Latin America  ] and heroin from [LOC South West Asia  ] , both generally heading to [LOC Europe  ] . 
Narcotics are brought into [LOC Ghana  ] from other destinations in [LOC West Africa  ] for shipment onward . 
[ORG Ghana’s  ] open business climate has made it an attractive location and cover for those involved in the narcotics trade . 
GOG officials have expressed concern that narcotics rings in [LOC Ghana  ] are growing in their strength and capacity. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Other challenges include money laundering and public sector corruption . 
As [LOC Ghana  ] becomes a petroleum producing country ( projected for 2011 ) , new security issues will arise involving maritime security . 
[ORG Ghana’s  ] borders-including its maritime border-are porous and allow the easy transshipment of drugs or other contraband. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Corruption remains an internal challenge to [ORG Ghana’s  ] ability to conduct counter-narcotics activities . 
The [ORG Ghana Police Service  ] has experienced scandals involving the disappearance of interdicted cocaine , and there is evidence of police complicity in the trafficking process . 
The [ORG Narcotics Control Board  ] ( [ORG NACOB  ] ) has also experienced issues with corruption . 
Narcotics were an issue in the 2008 Presidential election campaign , with both major party candidates pledging to take action against trafficking . 
President [PER John Atta Mills  ] , who took office January 2009 , moved quickly to appoint a new executive director of the [ORG NACOB  ] , which may be an indication that the issue will be a priority for his administration. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) What are the host government’s non-military sector’s capabilities to respond to these challenges ? 
Where ability to address these issues is lacking , please provide details: what knowledge , skills/training , equipment , relationships , policies and/or procedures are responsible for the lack of capacity ? : [ORG Ghana’s  ] law enforcement capabilities are limited . 
All branches of [ORG Ghana’s  ] civilian law enforcement community are under resourced , lack of equipment and training and the ability to adequately compensate personnel . 
Training , even in relatively basic law enforcement techniques , is needed . 
Inter-agency cooperation is also an issue , including cooperation with the [ORG Ghana Armed Forces  ] in areas such as narcotics interdiction , particularly along [ORG Ghana’s  ] coastline. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Counter-narcotics efforts concentrate on interdiction , particularly at the international airport , with little or no effort directed at pursuing mid and higher level traffickers or ringleaders . 
[MISC Ghanaian  ] security officials point to a specific lack of capacity in obtaining and analyzing intelligence , in surveillance techniques , and in their ability to investigate and prosecute complex cases such as financial crimes. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Highlight specific non-military security or judicial training requirements and the intended host government recipient agency: Although specific training and equipment needs and capacities vary somewhat between law enforcement organizations , those organizations involved in [ORG CN  ] ( [ORG Narcotics Control Board  ] , Police Service/CID , Customs and [ORG Excise Prevention Service  ] ) need assistance in developing their capacity to gather and analyze intelligence , conduct surveillance exercises , and conduct crime investigations . 
[ORG Ghana’s Police Service  ] and other law enforcement agencies would benefit from additional training opportunities in areas of general law enforcement . 
Entry level training is weak , and this condition has repercussions throughout law enforcement. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The recently appointed director of the [ORG Narcotics Control Board  ] has requested assistance in developing the NACOB’s ability to collect and analyze intelligence on traffickers . 
The [ORG Police/CID  ] would also benefit from such training , including also in the areas of financial investigations and surveillance techniques . 
[ORG Ghana’s  ] law enforcement agencies and prosecutors lack the capacity to undertake most complex investigations and prosecutions. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Training is recommended for a vetted unit capable of countering drug trafficking and money laundering operations . 
The specific [MISC Ghanaian  ] law enforcement agency to host a vetted unit has yet to be determined . 
Training is needed in areas such as financial crime investigations , technical operations , the handling of informants and surveillance techniques , interdiction techniques and crime scene analysis . 
Inter-agency cooperation is also an area where further training would improve performance , including in counter-narcotics. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Judicial and prosectorial capacity is also limited in [LOC Ghana  ] and would be well served by additional training opportunities . 
INL has budgeted for a [ORG Resident Legal Advisor  ] position to be posted with the [ORG Public Prosecutors Office  ] . 
The [ORG RLA  ] would work with [MISC Ghanaian  ] prosecutors and judges in the area of complex prosecutions , including narcotics and money laundering . 
Post supports the [ORG RLA  ] , and believes that longer term “mentoring” style training pays significant dividends. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) What is the host government’s willingness to accept and be an effective partner in the implementation of [ORG USG  ] assistance ? 
[ORG USG  ] and [MISC Ghanaian  ] law enforcement officials have a cordial and professional relationship . 
There is a history of [MISC Ghanaian  ] officials participating in [ORG USG  ] sponsored training programs . 
[MISC Ghanaian  ] authorities frequently request training or specific assistance from their [ORG USG  ] interlocutors . 
In the past year a limited number of [MISC Ghanaian  ] officials have told EMBOFFs that they would welcome additional opportunities for [ORG USG  ] supported training. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Other efforts by international partners in providing non-military security assistance and/or training to law enforcement and judicial institutions in the host country ? 
Several development partners provide training and assistance to the GOG on law enforcement matters . 
The [ORG UK’s Revenue and Customs Service  ] provides training and support to the [ORG NACOB  ] , especially in the area of airport narcotics interdiction . 
The [LOC UK  ] has also opened an office of its [ORG Serious Organized Crime Agency  ] in [LOC Ghana  ] . 
[LOC France  ] , [LOC Germany  ] , the [LOC Netherlands  ] , and other missions support limited training operations . 
The [ORG UN Office  ] on Drugs and Crime assists with a program at the Port of [LOC Tema  ] to scan cargo containers . 
While the other development partners would support additional participation by the [LOC U.S.  ] , there is a need to carefully coordinate activities . 
A local “mini-Dublin” group representing development partners meets periodically to coordinate programs. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Is there any type of existing or planned non-military regional training center in your country , operated either by an international partner or host country ? 
There are no known plans to create a regional training center per se . 
There has been discussion by [LOC UK  ] officials about using [LOC Ghana  ] as a site for training Anglophone [LOC West Africans  ] in [ORG CN  ] interdiction . 
The training would utilize a set of modules created by the [ORG UN  ] and currently used in [LOC Nigeria  ] . 
The modules focus on airport interdiction. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Provide a non-military embassy point of contact for future correspondence and coordination on this issue . 
Embassy Accra’s [ORG POC  ] should be [PER Jeffrey Breeden  ] , [ORG DEA Country AttachQ  ] , at [LOC BreedenJP@state.gov  ] and ( 233 ) 21-741-045 .
