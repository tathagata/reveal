( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG USUN  ] is authorized to join consensus on draft Presidential Statement ( paragraph 4 ) welcoming the just-announced November 30 date for the [MISC Ivorian  ] elections and exhorting all parties to keep elections preparations on track . 
[ORG USUN  ] may draw on the points in paragraph 3 during the April 29 [ORG Security Council  ] consultations on [LOC Cote  ] d'Ivoire. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) We call [ORG USUN  ] 's attention to paragraph 54 of the Secretary-General 's report of April 14 , 2008 , which notes SIPDIS that he may ask the [ORG Security Council  ] to authorize the temporary transfer of air assets and vehicles from [ORG UNMIL  ] to [ORG UNOCI  ] , a mechanism established by [ORG UNSCR  ] 1609 ( 2005 ) . 
Despite impressive progress , the security situation in [LOC Liberia  ] is still fragile , and the [ORG USG  ] would want to review any such request carefully . 
[ORG USUN  ] does not need to raise this issue , but should be prepared to respond if another delegation does. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) ( Introduction ) : The [LOC United States  ] welcomes the setting of a firm date for the nationwide elections in [LOC Cote  ] d'Ivoire . 
Although the road to restoring stability and prosperity to [LOC Cote  ] d'Ivoire has often been a bumpy one , it is crucial to keep moving forward . 
[LOC Cote  ] d'Ivoire was once the economic powerhouse for the region , with a long history of stable government . 
Nearly a decade of conflict undermined peace and prosperity for the [MISC Ivorian  ] people and was potentially destabilizing for [LOC West Africa  ] . 
In that context: -- We thank [ORG SRSG Choi  ] for his presentation and commend the vital contribution [ORG UNOCI  ] and its personnel are making to the peace process . 
The [LOC United States  ] welcomes the Secretary-General 's recommendations . 
SIPDIS -- We also welcome the continuing role played by [ORG Licorne  ] in supporting the peace process . 
-- We urge all parties to do their utmost to ensure that all necessary steps are taken to keep elections preparations on schedule . 
This includes providing the lists of personnel and weapons they have promised . 
In addition , it is critical that the identification process be completed , so that all [MISC Ivorians  ] have the opportunity of participating in the elections . 
November 30 is not that far away , and there is no time to be wasted . 
-- The [LOC United States  ] also notes with appreciation the report of the Group of Experts on the implementation of [ORG Security Council  ] sanctions related to [LOC Cote  ] d'Ivoire . 
We are concerned about continuing inconsistency in the application of those sanctions . 
Given the long sad history of the use of diamonds to fund conflict in the region , and the continuing problem of the availability of weapons in [LOC West Africa  ] , it is incumbent upon all of us to be thorough in our implementation of these vital measures . 
-- IF RAISED: We support and appreciate the efforts by the Government of [LOC Cote  ] d'Ivoire to move towards bringing peace and security to the people of [LOC Cote  ] d'Ivoire . 
However , the [LOC United States  ] cannot support the lifting of sanctions at this time . 
Prior to the lifting of the sanctions , more work needs to be done by the Government , including: holding free and fair elections , enhancing transparency , restoring the State 's authority over the entire territory , and making progress on the program for disarmament , demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants . 
-- We would also like to express our disappointment that the [MISC Ivorian  ] authorities continue to refuse [ORG UNOCI  ] access to facilities of the [ORG Republican Guard  ] . 
It is clear to the [LOC United States  ] that such inspections are within [ORG UNOCI  ] 's mandate to monitor implementation of the arms embargo , and we urge the Government of [LOC Cote  ] d'Ivoire to cooperate with [ORG UNOCI  ] in this regard . 
-- The [LOC United States  ] looks forward to the Secretary-General 's recommendations on a drawdown plan for SIPDIS [ORG UNOCI  ] , following the elections . 
STATE 00044904 002 OF 003 -- In conclusion , the [LOC United States  ] would also like to thank President [PER Compaore  ] of [LOC Burkina Faso  ] for his energetic and fruitful efforts as Facilitator of the [MISC Ivorian  ] peace process. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 .

This support to the actions of President [PER Laurent GBAGBO  ] and Prime Minister [PER Guillaume SORO  ] , with the active engagement of [ORG SRSG CHOI Young-Jin  ] , has been instrumental towards achieving the establishment of a consensus among all political parties to hold presidential elections in 2008 .

The [ORG Security Council  ] takes note with appreciation of the support of bilateral and multilateral donors , in particular ECOWAS , [ORG AU  ] and the [ORG EU  ] . 
It calls upon donors and the Government of [LOC Cote  ] d'Ivoire to make further efforts to finance the electoral process , including through the trust fund established by [ORG UNDP  ] to that effect , and calls upon the authorities of [LOC Cte  ] d'Ivoire to engage fully with the donors . 
It also encourages the international community to enhance its financial support for the facilitation . 
The [ORG Security Council  ] expresses its appreciation for the role played by the [ORG United Nations Operations in Cte  ] d' [ORG Ivoire  ] ( [ORG UNOCI  ] ) , supported by the [MISC French  ] forces , in contributing to bring the security needed by the peace process and the logistical support required for the preparation of the elections . 
It welcomes the assessment made by the Secretary-General on the troop level of [ORG UNOCI  ] STATE 00044904 003 OF 003 in his report ( S/2008/250 ) . 
The [ORG Security Council  ] will review by 30 July 2008 the mandates of [ORG UNOCI  ] and [MISC French  ] forces which support it , as well as the level of troops of [ORG UNOCI  ] , in accordance with paragraph 8 of Resolution 1795 ( 2008 ) .
