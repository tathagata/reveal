End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The economic situation in [LOC Iceland  ] has visibly deteriorated since December . 
Unemployment is currently at 10.3 percent , a dramatic rise from under two percent just five months ago . 
When you were last in [LOC Iceland  ] , there were anecdotal claims that up to 70 percent of businesses were technically insolvent because the depreciating [ORG ISK  ] had ballooned their foreign currency loan payments . 
That has proven to be the case . 
In addition to vacant construction sites with half-finished projects , a walk down the main shopping street in [LOC Reykjavik  ] reveals newly vacant storefronts from failed businesses or desperate posters for final sales . 
Other signs of the hard times include [ORG Baugur  ] , one of the biggest holding companies in [LOC Iceland  ] , declaring bankruptcy and the [ORG Financial Supervisory Authority  ] 's takeover of investment bank Straumur-Burdaras on March <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
The temporary capital controls that expired March 1 were extended an additional six months . 
The [ORG ISK  ] is being helped by a small trade surplus , although the two main pillars for exports , aluminum and fish , have suffered in the global downturn . 
Worldwide aluminum demand has dropped , and the resulting price decreases have slowed production at the country 's smelters . 
The reduced demand for fish has fisherman storing their catch ; we hear reports that the freezer capacity is nearly maxed out. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The public discontent over the economic situation and the government 's apparent lack of action led to a series of escalating public protests . 
As a result , the centrist government fell in January , and a leftist interim coalition was put in place . 
The most relevant Cabinet changes to your visit are the new Minister ( and Permanent Secretary ) at the [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] , a new Minister of [ORG Business Affairs  ] , and a new Prime Minister . 
Minister of [ORG Business Affairs  ] [PER Gylfi Magnusson  ] , whom you will meet , is a non-political academic educated at [ORG Yale  ] . 
Upon installation of the new government , the [ORG Central Bank  ] leadership structure was changed which resulted in the hire of a [MISC Norwegian  ] interim [ORG Bank Director  ] . 
The [ORG Board  ] at the [ORG Financial Supervisory Authority  ] was also changed , with another academic appointed as Chair. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As the [ORG IMF  ] team found during their two-week visit that ended last week , the political turmoil has delayed dealing with crucial issues like resolving the dispute with the [LOC UK  ] and other [ORG EU  ] countries over deposit guarantees for the [MISC IceSave  ] accounts . 
The interim coalition is acting cautiously , knowing their actions today and the public perception of those actions will directly affect the outcome of the April 25 general elections . 
Inconclusive public opinion polls have given the parties little ground to feel confident , and they are watching every move carefully . 
As an example , one of the first acts of the new Minister of Health was to reverse the unpopular cost-cutting decision of his predecessor to close a small hospital , despite the fact that his Ministry is under the gun to make nearly [ORG ISK  ] 7 billion ( $60 million ) in budget cuts . 
There is pressure on the [ORG Central Bank  ] to lower the prime index rate . 
However , public calls to join the [ORG EU  ] and adopt the [MISC Euro  ] are not as intense as in October . 
Only the business sector continues to advocate this position ; the latest poll indicated 54.5 percent of the general public were against joining the [ORG EU.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The change in government has also loosened tongues and you'll find many interlocutors are offering details of the situation leading up to the banks collapse . 
The government was criticized for not investigating criminal activities within the banks and the international corporations , and as a response [MISC French-Norwegian  ] anti-corruption crusader [PER Eva Joly  ] has been hired as a special government consultant for the investigation of economic crimes . 
Mysterious leaks to the media of the banks' loan books are revealing that the banks' owners were manipulating their stock prices and that the quality of loans ( previously touted as sound ) deteriorated [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000058 002 OF 002 before the collapse. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: Installing new experts in key positions such as the [ORG Central Bank  ] , the [ORG Financial Supervisory Authority  ] and some ministries , is positive and will provide needed expertise . 
However , given that the interim government is acutely aware of the impending April 25 general elections , it is unclear how much progress will be made before a new government is installed . 
The vital question of how the [MISC Icelandic  ] economy will adapt to the new global economic realities remains unclear .
