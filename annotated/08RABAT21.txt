Riley  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: Ambassador [PER Riley  ] paid an introductory call on January 4 , 2008 with [PER Khaled Naciri  ] , the new [MISC Moroccan  ] Minister of Communications and Government Spokesman . 
[PER Naciri  ] stated that passing a revised , more liberal press code was one of his top policy priorities . 
He defended , however , the need to maintain prison sentences in rare cases as a " precaution , " arguing in particular that publication of anything that might be deemed a " provocation " against [MISC Islam  ] could reinforce fundamentalism and destabilize [MISC Moroccan  ] democracy . 
He pledged that the [ORG Fassi  ] government would not limit freedom of expression , and described plans to further liberalize the audiovisual sector . 
[PER Naciri  ] assured the Ambassador that [LOC Morocco  ] was committed to combating video piracy , recognizing the importance of the film industry to the [MISC Moroccan  ] economy . 
He also discussed Government of [LOC Morocco  ] ( [ORG GOM  ] ) efforts to promote a moderate vision of [MISC Islam  ] in [LOC Morocco  ] and with [MISC Arab  ] communities abroad via a public television and radio network focused on religion . 
A former international visitor program ( [ORG IVP  ] ) participant , [PER Naciri  ] expressed appreciation for USG efforts to promote professionalism and ethical journalistic practices in [LOC Morocco  ] through training and exchange programs . 
End summary. ------------------------------ Promoting Freedom of the Press ------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Said [PER Sihida  ] , head of the minister 's cabinet , and an aide joined from the [ORG Ministry of Communications  ] ( [ORG MOC  ] ) ; the [ORG PAO  ] and [ORG IO  ] accompanied the Ambassador . 
The Ambassador opened by asking [PER Naciri  ] for an update on the long-promised revised press code , noting that its passage was a top USG policy priority . 
[PER Naciri  ] stated that this was one of his two top priorities as well ( the other being liberalization of the audiovisual sector - see para 6 below ) . 
He stated that the previous government had hoped to finalize and introduce it to parliament last year , but the government had run out of time because of parliamentary elections . 
[PER Naciri  ] repeated a familiar refrain that the [ORG Ministry of Communications  ] had been caught in the middle between the competing interests of the media community ( which wanted to see the draft further liberalized ) , and the [ORG Ministries of Interior and Justice  ] ( which had taken a more conservative stance ) . 
[PER Naciri  ] stated that he had already held consultations with all the key stakeholders , and was in the process of collecting final comments. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Naciri  ] 's goal was to reach consensus on a final draft text that would be more liberal than the existing one , but which would preserve key " precautions , " including prison sentences for a very few " extreme cases , " notably concerning the three red-lines: [MISC Islam  ] , the monarchy and " territorial integrity " ( read: [LOC Western Sahara  ] ) . 
Journalists had expressed concern that the provisions of the new law were too vague , but [PER Naciri  ] argued it was not possible to have an exact recipe for what constituted a transgression . 
Nevertheless , " you will see that the new text will be a step forward . . . a very , very liberal text , " he stated , taking into account the views of all the stakeholders , and in which prisons sentences would be very limited. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Naciri  ] stated that application of the law was as important as the law itself . 
The new press code should be considered in the context of a [MISC Moroccan  ] Government commitment to openness and democracy . 
He noted that prison sentences existed in the [MISC French  ] press code ; they were never applied , but were nevertheless maintained as a precaution . 
He stated that fundamentalism was one of the main political forces confronting the [MISC Arab  ] world today ; [MISC Arab  ] governments could not allow this phenomenon to be reinforced , and provocations against [MISC Islam  ] , he stated , fed the demagoguery of the fundamentalists . 
" We must not allow democracy to be used by those who want to destabilize it , " he stated , which was the underlying reason for the existence of the red-lines in the press code . 
Every day , [PER Naciri  ] stated , there were examples of transgressions of the red-lines in the press , which the [MISC Moroccan  ] Government chose not to prosecute . 
This demonstrated that , regardless the text of the press code , the government was committed politically and philosophically to permitting the maximum possible freedom of the press ; " This government will not threaten freedom of expression , " he averred. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The Ambassador stated that [LOC Morocco  ] was known internationally for its advances in the area of press freedom , but it was important to remain vigilant . 
He commented that international organizations and non-governmental watchdog groups evaluated press freedom as much by the written law as by its application ; this was a reality that underscored the need for a revised press code . 
[PER Naciri  ] responded that the [ORG GOM  ] was endeavoring to strike a balance . 
He reminded the Ambassador that he was first and foremost a human rights activist , and that he understood the point of view of such [ORG NGOs  ] . 
" I am imbued in the human rights philosophy , " he stated , which " does not change just because I am a minister . 
" ( Note: [PER Naciri  ] previously participated in an international visitor program focused on human rights issues . 
End note . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Naciri  ] stated that his second priority was the further liberalization of the audiovisual sector . 
In this regard , he expected that the Higher [ORG Audiovisual Communications Authority  ] ( [ORG HACA  ] ) would be issuing additional licenses for private television and radio stations this year . 
He also discussed the planned launch of a publicly-financed [PER Amazigh  ] ( [PER Berber  ] ) television channel in the coming months . 
[PER Naciri  ] stated that the core team was already in place , with plans to begin broadcasting six to seven hours per day , but that the Minister of Finance had not yet approved the expensive budget for the project. ----------------------------------- Video Piracy Bad for [MISC Moroccan  ] Image ----------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Naciri  ] , who heads a governmental committee on the enforcement of intellectual property rights ( [ORG IPR  ] ) , stated that the promotion of the film industry in [LOC Morocco  ] was an additional priority . 
He acknowledged receipt of a letter from the Ambassador expressing concern about the availability in [MISC Moroccan  ] markets of a high-quality pirated version of [PER Ridley Scott  ] 's latest film " [MISC American Gangster  ] . 
" Noting the key economic role played by the film industry in [LOC Morocco  ] , the Ambassador reiterated his concern that this pirated video went on sale while [PER Scott  ] was filming his latest film in [LOC Morocco  ] . 
He also related a conversation he had had with a well-known [MISC Moroccan  ] singer , now living in [LOC Europe  ] , who was one of the most popular singers in [LOC Morocco  ] but had sold only ten legitimate copies of his latest CD in the whole country . 
He expressed concern that [MISC Moroccan  ] artists could not survive without moving to [LOC Europe.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Naciri  ] stated flatly that [MISC Moroccan  ] did not want to be associated with this sort of piracy . 
[PER Naciri  ] assured the Ambassador that the [MISC Moroccan  ] security forces were on board regarding the need to enforce IPR. -------------------------------------- Using the Airwaves to Combat Extremism -------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Expanding on his earlier discussion of the threat of [MISC Islamic  ] fundamentalism , [PER Naciri  ] raised [ORG GOM  ] efforts to promote a moderate vision of [MISC Islam  ] on the government-owned [PER Mohamed VI  ] television and radio network , which is focused on religious issues . 
Such programming was intended to counterbalance fundamentalist messages about [MISC Islam  ] that were circulating widely in [LOC Morocco  ] via [MISC Arab  ] satellite networks such as al-Jazeera , as well as from [LOC Europe  ] , advanced by preachers of a " catastrophic vision of [MISC Islam  ] . 
" " We are in a difficult battle , " he stated . 
The strategic objective of the [ORG GOM  ] was to promote , via [PER Mohamed VI  ] television and radio , an alternative mindset , in order to influence [MISC Moroccans  ] in [LOC Morocco  ] , and [MISC Arabs  ] living in [LOC Europe  ] , to embrace moderation . 
( Note: [PER Mohamed VI  ] television and radio , part of the government-owned television and radio corporation [ORG SNRT  ] , was founded two years ago as a venue for the [ORG GOM  ] to broadcast moderate perspectives on [MISC Islam  ] . 
It is available via both local and satellite broadcast , and is piped in to mosques throughout the country , allowing the government to provide AV content , such as sermons and lessons on [MISC Islam  ] , that conform with its moderate vision . 
End note . 
) -------------------------------------- Promoting Professionalism in the Media -------------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG IO  ] provided [PER Naciri  ] a briefing on [ORG USG  ] efforts to promote professionalism and the ethical practice of journalism in [LOC Morocco  ] . 
Over the past ten years , the [ORG USG  ] had sponsored the participation of roughly 100 journalists in a variety of exchange programs in the [LOC U.S.  ] , the [ORG IO  ] noted , as well as in reporting tours abroad in places such as [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC Mali  ] . 
The [ORG USG  ] had also provided in-country training , conducted by [MISC American  ] and local experts , on issues ranging from investigative reporting , to journalistic ethics , to citizen and electronic journalism . 
[PER Naciri  ] expressed enthusiasm for these programs , and hoped to reinforce and expand them. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Naciri  ] 's comments on the revised press code confirm concerns expressed to us recently by senior members of the [MISC Moroccan  ] press establishment that short-term progress is unlikely , and reinforce our impression that nothing will happen absent a clear expression of royal will . 
Notwithstanding [PER Naciri  ] 's assurances that a new draft would be very liberal , the prison sentences he pledged to maintain are a non-starter for local publishers , editors and journalists . 
Moreover , given that [MISC Moroccan  ] law continues to be deployed on a sporadic but regular basis to stifle press freedom , it is unlikely that anyone in the local press community would be assuaged by [PER Naciri  ] 's statement that prison sentences will be used sparingly . 
We will continue to press this issue at every opportunity with senior [ORG GOM  ] officials . 
[PER Naciri  ] 's statements on promoting moderate [MISC Muslim  ] messaging demonstrate the [ORG GOM  ] commitment to creatively employing its own substantial resources to combat extremism . 
End comment .
