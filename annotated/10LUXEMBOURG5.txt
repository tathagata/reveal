( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY: Former [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] ( [ORG GTMO  ] ) detainee [PER Moazzam Begg  ] met with Foreign Minister [PER Jean Asselborn  ] 14 January 2010 to press the government of [LOC Luxembourg  ] to accept [ORG GTMO  ] detainees for resettlement . 
[PER Begg  ] , a [MISC British  ] citizen of [MISC Pakistani  ] origin , was arrested in [LOC Pakistan  ] in 2002 and imprisoned in [LOC Kandahar  ] , [LOC Bagram  ] , and [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] , before his release to [LOC Britain  ] in 2005 . 
In a statement to [ORG RTL Television  ] , [PER Asselborn  ] said that [LOC Luxembourg  ] will do what is possible and reiterated the government’s position to provide financial assistance , training and housing costs , and other technical assistance . 
Consular officer attended an evening screening of the documentary film “Taxi to the [PER Dark Side  ] , ” followed by a Q&A session with [PER Begg  ] . 
When asked if he thought [LOC Luxembourg  ] will do more than contribute financially to the resettlement efforts , [PER Begg  ] replied that he was “pleasantly surprised” with his conversations with [ORG MFA  ] officials and “hopeful.” END SUMMARY -------------------------------------------- AUDIENCE WITH FOREIGN MINISTER -------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG Ex-GTMO  ] detainee [PER Moazzam Begg  ] , released from [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] in 2005 , is barnstorming throughout [LOC Europe  ] , pushing governments to accept [ORG GTMO  ] detainees for resettlement . 
Following his release from [ORG GTMO  ] , [PER Begg  ] created an [ORG NGO  ] dedicated to this cause , called Caged Prisoners . 
Representatives from two additional [ORG NGOs  ] , [ORG Reprieve and Center for Constitutional Rights  ] , accompanied [PER Begg  ] on his visit to [LOC Luxembourg  ] . 
[LOC Luxembourg  ] media coverage on the [MISC Asselborn-Begg  ] meeting was ubiquitous , but superficial . 
With numerous reports that the meeting occurred , nearly all media outlets were silent on the actual substance of the meeting . 
Only [PER Begg  ] provided some limited insight into the outcome of the meeting . 
Speaking later in the evening ( see para 4 ) , he responded to an inquiry about the meeting by saying that “without giving anything away , ” he was “pleasantly surprised” and “hopeful.” --------------------------------------------- ----------- ASSELBORN: “WE’LL HELP”/BEGG: “DO MORE” --------------------------------------------- ----------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In an interview following his meeting with [PER Begg  ] , [PER Asselborn  ] avoided specifics of the discussion . 
He reiterated Luxembourg’s willingness to provide financial assistance to the resettlement efforts - the [MISC GoL  ] party line for many months . 
[PER Asselborn  ] said , however , that he was in regular contact with [MISC American  ] officials , including Special Envoy [PER Dan Fried  ] , as recently as last week . 
( See refs a and b on the [MISC Asselborn-Fried  ] meeting in September 2009 in [LOC Luxembourg  ] and subsequent exchange of letters . 
) In comments to the press following the meeting , [PER Begg  ] only explained what the messages he delivered were - not how those messages were received . 
[PER Begg’s  ] primary message is that [MISC European  ] governments have to step up and accept some of the [ORG GTMO  ] detainees for resettlement . 
[PER Begg  ] , an articulate man , argued that there are dozens of prisoners in [ORG GTMO  ] just like him - not dangerous to society , able to communicate and assimilate , able to be a contributing and responsible member of society - and they just need governments to stand up and offer them a place to call home . 
In an interview prior to his meeting with [PER Asselborn  ] , [PER Begg  ] was asked if countries like [LOC Luxembourg  ] have a responsibility regarding ex-detainees . 
[PER Begg  ] reportedly responded that it is a [MISC European  ] tradition to offer asylum to refugees , and that this tradition also should be extended to former [ORG Guantanamo  ] detainees who have not been convicted of crimes , are not dangerous , and are deemed as releasable . 
[LOC LUXEMBOURG  ] 00000005 002 OF 003 ---------------- TAXI TO HELL ---------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Begg  ] later attended an [MISC Amnesty International-hosted  ] screening of 2007 [PER Oscar Winner  ] for [ORG Best Documentary  ] “Taxi to the [MISC Dark Side”  ] ( [MISC French  ] translation of film title: “Taxi to Hell” ) . 
Conoff attended screening and [PER Begg’s  ] Q&A session following the film . 
The film , a harrowing depiction of alleged torture inside [LOC Bagram  ] , [LOC Abu Ghraib  ] , and [LOC Guantanamo  ] , was an undisguised attack on the [ORG Bush Administration  ] , focusing much of its venom on Former Defense Secretary [PER Rumsfeld  ] and Former Vice President [PER Cheney  ] . 
Mr. [PER Begg  ] , on the other hand , presented an image of “forgive , but never forget , ” and has focused his attentions not on the ill treatment he allegedly received , but on what can be done to resettle the remaining “releasable” prisoners in [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] . 
Reporting officer estimates 100-150 people attended the filming and Q&A session and noted the complete absence of press , other diplomats , or [MISC GoL  ] officials. --------------------------------------------- - LOOKING FORWARD , NOT BACKWARD --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) During his presentation , [PER Begg  ] spoke almost exclusively of the future , with hardly any mention of the past . 
He did not discuss the question of legality of torture . 
Rather than stressing past injustices , he focused on what to do now . 
He acknowledged that he lives with the past , but that he now wants to be part of the solution , and is working to convince [LOC Luxembourg  ] and other governments - and their populaces - to want the same. --------------------------------------- LUXEMBOURGERS NOT SO SURE --------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In a 90-minute Q&A session , [PER Begg  ] was asked , how would ex-detainees fit in in [LOC Luxembourg  ] . 
How would it work ? 
Where would they live ? 
How would they be supported ? 
The fear and skepticism was palpable in the audience . 
[PER Begg  ] and his [ORG NGO  ] cohorts stressed that there were [MISC Algerians  ] and [MISC Tunisians  ] in [ORG GTMO  ] who could come to [LOC Luxembourg  ] and speak [MISC French  ] , one of Luxembourg’s official and most-commonly used languages . 
He stressed that neighboring countries - [LOC France  ] , [LOC Belgium  ] , [LOC Portugal  ] , [LOC Ireland  ] - provided examples . 
[PER Begg  ] even argued that if detainees could fit in in [LOC Palau  ] , they could do the same in [LOC Luxembourg  ] . 
[PER Begg  ] deplored that certain people believe the world is not big enough for the ex-detainees . 
He added that if there were colonies on the Moon , “I’m sure they’d send us there.” <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Begg  ] declined to speak about specific physical transgressions against his person . 
When told how physically well and mentally sound he appeared , he joked , “Well , I used to be taller.” [PER Begg  ] spoke articulately , demonstrating minimal ill will toward his captors - even going so far as to say he speaks on the [LOC LUXEMBOURG  ] 00000005 003 OF 003 phone occasionally with his former interrogators . 
Consular officer took note of the following exchange: Asked if he would ever consider a return to the [LOC U.S.  ] , [PER Begg  ] replied that he had never been to the [LOC U.S.  ] , but that the [LOC U.S.  ] had come to him . 
[PER Begg  ] commented that as a [MISC British  ] citizen , he could travel to the [LOC U.S.  ] without a visa , but that he thinks he would need “a lot more than a visa to get out.” ------------- COMMENT ------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Mr. [PER Begg  ] is doing our work for us , and his articulate , reasoned presentation makes for a convincing argument . 
It is ironic that after four years of imprisonment and alleged torture , [PER Moazzam Begg  ] is delivering the same demarche to [MISC GOL  ] as we are: please consider accepting [ORG GTMO  ] detainees for resettlement . 
Despite [PER Begg’s  ] optimism , the Prime and Foreign Ministers continue to publicly state that the [MISC GoL  ] supports the closure of the [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] detention facility and stands ready to assist from a financial and logistical perspective , but cannot accept detainees for resettlement. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 .
