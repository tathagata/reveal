John  ] , reason 1.4 ( b , d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) Summary: Ambassador paid a series of [MISC New Year’s-related  ] calls on influential [MISC Thai  ] figures , including [ORG Privy Council Chair GEN Prem  ] , [ORG Privy Council  ] member [PER ACM Siddhi  ] , and former PM [PER Anand  ] , to discuss the year ahead . 
Abhisit’s performance , issues related to the royal family , and challenges posed by [ORG Thaksin/Hun  ] Sen emerged as the primary themes . 
[PER Prem  ] offered a more positive assessment of Abhisit’s performance than [PER Siddhi  ] , who criticized [PER Abhisit  ] for a lack of resolve and the absence of an effective team to carry out his policies . 
All three focused on the challenge posed by [PER Thaksin  ] to the government and , indirectly , to the monarchy ; [PER Anand  ] attributed part of the King’s poor health to [PER Thaksin  ] , and both [PER Prem  ] and [PER Siddhi  ] were upset about Thaksin’s alliance of convenience with [MISC Cambodian  ] leader Hun [MISC Sen. All  ] three had quite negative comments about [MISC Crown  ] [PER Prince Vajiralongkorn  ] . 
While asserting that the [MISC Crown  ] Prince will become King , both [PER Siddhi  ] and [PER Anand  ] implied the country would be better off if other arrangements could be made . 
[PER Siddhi  ] expressed preference for Princess Sirindhorn ; [PER Anand  ] suggested only the King would be in a position to change succession , and acknowledged a low likelihood of that happening. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) Comment: On the two most difficult and sensitive issues of the day in [LOC Thailand  ] -- [PER Thaksin  ] and the monarchy -- the [MISC Thai  ] elite appear as unsure about the future as any other sector of society . 
The stakes are significant for all sides , and resolution of the political divide and royal succession could still be far over the horizon . 
Elite concerns about [PER Abhisit  ] in office appear to reflect less on his performance than on general worries about the ultimate resolution of issues . 
End Summary and Comment . 
Mixed Views on Abhisit’s performance ------------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG Privy Councilor Chair GEN Prem  ] shared his assessments of PM [PER Abhisit  ] , the [ORG Crown Prince’s  ] relationship with [PER Thaksin  ] , and difficulties dealing with [MISC Cambodia/Hun  ] Sen with Ambassador over lunch January 13 . 
Regarding [PER Abhisit  ] , [PER Prem  ] referenced widespread criticism that the PM was too young and not strong enough to be an effective leader in trying times . 
However , [PER Prem  ] felt that [PER Abhisit  ] had proved in 2009 that he was up to the challenge of doing what was necessary to run a fractious coalition government , no easy task . 
In addition , there were no other politicians available who were more principled and had more integrity than [PER Abhisit  ] , and [LOC Thailand  ] needed such a leader at this point . 
[PER Prem  ] expressed hope that [MISC Thais  ] and foreigners alike would be more patient with [PER Abhisit  ] , who he believed was the right man to serve as premier. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Fellow [ORG Privy Councilor ACM Siddhi  ] , hosting Ambassador at his home January 11 , was more critical of [PER Abhisit  ] than [PER Prem  ] . 
[PER Siddhi  ] said that he had told Abhisit’s father , his own long-time personal physician , that his son needed to be more decisive and “make more friends” in 2010 . 
[PER Abhisit  ] spent too much time at the podium and not enough time assembling an effective team to which he could delegate action and rely on for well-thought out policy initiatives , in Siddhi’s view . 
[PER Abhisit  ] also needed to get out to engage the grassroots , one of Thaksin’s strengths . 
On Siddhi’s wish list: [PER Abhisit  ] pushing through a permanent appointment for Acting Police Chief Pratheep ; using his power over wayward coalition parties by threatening parliamentary dissolution if they did not get in line ; and telling the Army to take action to dismiss renegade [ORG MGEN Khattiya  ] , even if Defense Minister Prawit refused to sign a dismissal order . 
Political Year Ahead -------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) While GEN [PER Prem  ] expressed moderate concern about the potential for violence and political discord in early 2010 , he felt the situation was no worse than six months ago . 
[PER Prem  ] asked about [LOC U.S.  ] laws regarding demonstrations and avoiding [LOC BANGKOK  ] 00000192 002.2 OF 003 excessive disruptions of government functions and daily lives of citizens ; Ambassador explained the [LOC U.S.  ] system of permits for protests which allowed for free speech but not free access everywhere . 
Ambassador shared [LOC U.S.  ] frustration about decisions negatively affecting economic/investment climate , such as [PER Ma Tha Phut  ] and the digital lottery cancellation ; the uneven application of the rule of law , breaches of contract , and regulatory shifts affected the investment climate more negatively at this point than political turmoil. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) ACM [PER Siddhi  ] expressed more concerns than [PER Prem  ] about the security situation in 2010 , suggesting that Army Commander Anupong’s inability to control wayward red-affiliated [ORG MGEN Khattiya’s M-79  ] attacks on yellow-shirt rallies and trips to see [PER Thaksin  ] overseas was not a good harbinger ( note: three days later , someone attacked Anupong’s office at night with an [ORG M-79  ] , with [PER Khattiya  ] widely seen as the likely suspect , see reftel . 
End note ) . 
[PER Siddhi  ] said he had higher hopes for deputy Commander Prayuth , widely expected to replace [PER Anupong  ] in October and seen as particularly close to the Queen . 
[PER Siddhi  ] claimed [PER Prem  ] had sent a signal of his displeasure with [PER Anupong  ] by snubbing him during a group call at Prem’s residence to pass birthday greetings , not stopping to talk to [PER Anupong  ] personally as he did with other key military commanders . 
Royal [PER Family: King  ] , [MISC Crown  ] [PER Prince  ] , Entourages -------------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) Regarding King Bhumibol’s health , [PER Prem  ] indicated that the King was exercising 30 minutes a day on a stationary bicycle at [LOC Siriraj Hospital  ] and passing a medicine ball with a physical therapist to build up strength and regain weight . 
[PER Prem  ] acknowledged that he had not seen the King since the hospitalization , but that the Queen and Princess Sirindhorn saw the King daily . 
When Ambassador asked about the [ORG Crown Prince’s  ] involvement , [PER Prem  ] repeated: the Queen and [PER Sirindhorn  ] visit him daily. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) [PER Prem  ] acknowledged [MISC Crown  ] [PER Prince Vajiralongkorn  ] probably maintained some sort of relationship with fugitive former PM [PER Thaksin  ] , “seeing him from time to time.” [PER Prem  ] , clearly no fan of either man , cautioned that [PER Thaksin  ] ran the risk of self-delusion if he thought that the [MISC Crown  ] [PER Prince  ] would act as his friend/supporter in the future merely because of Thaksin’s monetary support ; “he does not enjoy that sort of relationship.” When Ambassador asked where the [MISC Crown  ] [PER Prince  ] was currently , in [LOC Thailand  ] or [LOC Europe  ] , [PER Prem  ] replied dismissively: “You know his social life , how he is.” ( Note: a presumed reference to Vajiralongkorn’s preference to spend time based out of [LOC Munich  ] with his main mistress , rather than in [LOC Thailand  ] with his wife and son ) . <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) ACM [PER Siddhi  ] , in a similar vein , noted that the [ORG Crown Prince  ] frequently slipped away from [LOC Thailand  ] , and that information about his air hostess mistresses was widely available on websites ; he lamented how his former aide , now [MISC Thai  ] Ambassador to [LOC Germany  ] , was forced to leave [LOC Berlin  ] for [LOC Munich  ] often to receive [PER Vajiralongkorn  ] . 
[PER Siddhi  ] raised Thaksin’s controversial November Times On-line interview , which [PER Siddhi  ] claimed cast the King in a bad light and attempted to praise the [ORG Crown Prince  ] as broad-minded and educated abroad , hinting that [PER Vajiralongkorn  ] would be ready to welcome [PER Thaksin  ] back to [LOC Thailand  ] once he became [PER King.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) Ambassador mentioned to [PER Siddhi  ] the [ORG Crown Prince’s  ] more engaging approach in the early December King’s Birthday reception with Ambassadors , shaking each envoy’s hand and appearing more at ease than in the 2008 reception . 
[PER Siddhi  ] stated that succession would be a difficult transition time for [LOC Thailand  ] . 
According to [LOC Palace Law  ] , the [ORG Crown Prince  ] would succeed his father , but added after a pause , almost hopefully: “if the [ORG Crown Prince  ] were to die , anything could happen , and maybe [MISC Prathep  ] ( [ORG Sirindhorn  ] ) could succeed.” <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S ) Ambassador similarly raised the [ORG Crown Prince’s  ] more confident demeanor with former PM [PER Anand  ] in late December , seeking Anand’s assessment of the dynamics in play as succession inevitably drew nearer . 
Anand’s response was [LOC BANGKOK  ] 00000192 003.2 OF 003 similar to Siddhi’s , but more detailed and blunt . 
[PER Anand  ] said that he had always believed that the [ORG Crown Prince  ] would succeed his father , according to law . 
However , there could be complicating factors -- if Vajiralongkohn proved unable to stay out of politics , or avoid embarrassing financial transactions . 
After a pause , [PER Anand  ] added that the consensus view among many [MISC Thai  ] was that the [MISC Crown  ] [PER Prince  ] could not stop either , nor would he be able , at age 57 , to rectify his behavior . 
After another pause , [PER Anand  ] added that someone really should raise the matter with the King , before adding with regret that there really was no one who could raise such a delicate topic ( note: implied was the need for an alternative to [PER Vajiralongkorn  ] ) . <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( S ) ACM [PER Siddhi  ] expressed his personal concern about the declining image of the royal family in [LOC Thailand  ] , noting that something as simple as excessive motorcade-related traffic jams caused by minor royals was an unnecessary but enduring irritant . 
Personal Private Secretary [PER Arsa Sarasin  ] had raised this with the King about eight years ago , according to [PER Siddhi  ] , and the King had agreed , authorizing [PER Arsa  ] to talk to royal family members and to set up new rules limiting entourages and occasions when traffic would be stopped . 
Nothing had changed ; [PER Siddhi  ] noted that he had been caught up in traffic for 45 minutes the previous week returning for a meeting with the [MISC Chinese  ] Ambassador , due to a royal motorcade . 
Stories that the [MISC Crown  ] Prince now ordered second story windows closed as his motorcade passed achieved nothing but additional popular resentment , [PER Siddhi  ] added sorrowfully . 
[PER Thaksin  ] and [PER Hun Sen  ] ------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Thaksin  ] clearly remained on the mind of all three “establishment” figures . 
Former PM [PER Anand  ] asserted that the King’s health and mood remained poor “primarily because of [ORG Thaksin”  ] and the challenge [PER Thaksin  ] posed to the stability of the country . 
GEN [PER Prem  ] asked Ambassador what the [LOC U.S.  ] would do in the situation [LOC Thailand  ] found itself , with a neighboring country appointing as an adviser a former leader bent on bringing down the government . 
Ambassador replied that while former [LOC U.S.  ] Presidents did occasionally give paid speeches overseas , they would never work for another government ; he advised [PER Prem  ] and [MISC Thai  ] officials to take the high road in their public comments about [LOC Cambodia  ] , and not to be drawn into a tit for tat with [PER Thaksin  ] and [PER Hun Sen  ] . 
( Note: [PER Prem  ] seemed to be musing out loud , but he clearly was focused on what he perceived as a threat from [PER Thaksin  ] and [PER Hun Sen’s  ] facilitation of Thaksin’s efforts ) . <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) ACM [PER Siddhi  ] said that PM [PER Abhisit  ] had called him on his 90th birthday recently and had indicated that now that [LOC Thailand  ] was no longer [MISC ASEAN Chair  ] , Abhisit would feel less constrained in responding to [PER Hun Sen’s  ] bullying rhetoric more freely . 
[PER Siddhi  ] expressed concern that in addition to [LOC Cambodia  ] and [LOC Brunei  ] , clearly in Thaksin’s camp due to his close personal ties with [PER Hun Sen  ] and the [LOC Brunei  ] Sultan , [LOC Laos  ] and [LOC Vietnam  ] might back [PER Hun Sen  ] in the ongoing [MISC Thai-Cambodia  ] diplomatic spat. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) ACM [PER Siddhi  ] attacked [PER Thaksin  ] as trying to use money , red-shirt protests , and [PER Hun Sen  ] to “destroy our country , ” but he predicted [PER Thaksin  ] would not succeed . 
[PER Thaksin  ] never had tried to negotiate , [PER Siddhi  ] alleged , but only issued demands ; had he been willing to come back and spend a nominal time in jail for his conviction , [PER Thaksin  ] likely would have been quickly pardoned/released as a former PM . 
Now [PER Thaksin  ] would try to create chaos , possibly sparking the use of force . 
While [PER Siddhi  ] expected [PER Thaksin  ] to lose the February 26 decision on his 76 billion baht ( $2.3 billion ) in frozen assets , he claimed his sources indicated [PER Thaksin  ] still had 240 billion baht ( $7.3 billion ) overseas . 
Rather than live overseas quietly , [PER Thaksin  ] had decided to fight , funding websites attacking the King and Queen to stir up anti-monarchy views .
