05 STATE 141756 ( AND PREVIOUS ) Classified By: ISN/MTR Director [PER Pam Durham  ] . 
Reason: 1.5 ( B ) , ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) This is an action request . 
[ORG Embassy Brasilia  ] , please see paragraph 7. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) BACKGROUND: [ORG REF  ] A reports that the [MISC Ukrainian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Brasilia  ] is urging the [LOC U.S.  ] to reconsider its position on support for the [MISC Ukrainian-Brazilian  ] [ORG Tsyklon Space Launch Project  ] and allow the launch of [LOC U.S.  ] satellites from [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Alcantara  ] launch site on the [ORG Tsyklon  ] ( [ORG Cyclone  ] ) launch vehicle . 
As noted [ORG REF  ] B , the [LOC U.S.  ] will not authorize the launch of [LOC U.S.  ] satellites or foreign satellites with [MISC U.S.-licensed  ] components from [ORG Alcantara  ] until the [ORG U.S.-Brazil Technology Safeguards Agreement  ] ( [ORG TSA  ] ) , which [LOC Brazil  ] has yet to ratify , enters into effect . 
Additionally , while the [LOC U.S.  ] is prepared to support the joint [MISC Ukrainian-Brazilian  ] project once the [ORG U.S.-Brazil TSA  ] becomes active , it does not support [LOC Brazil  ] 's indigenous space launch vehicle ( [ORG SLV  ] ) program. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND FOR POSTS' INFORMATION ONLY: For several years , [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Ukraine  ] have been seeking to establish a launch facility for the [MISC Ukrainian  ] [ORG Tsyklon  ] ( [ORG Cyclone  ] ) [ORG SLV  ] at [LOC Alcantara  ] . 
The two countries have signed an umbrella space agreement and a [ORG Technology Safeguards Agreement  ] to facilitate this project , but neither country has had the funds needed to establish a [ORG Tsyklon  ] launch facility . 
A key impediment to funding is the current inability to launch [LOC U.S.  ] satellites ( and non-U.S. satellites with [MISC U.S.-licensed  ] components ) from [ORG Alcantara.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] currently does not permit launches of [LOC U.S.  ] satellites or foreign satellites with [MISC U.S.-licensed  ] components from [LOC Alcantara  ] because of our longstanding policy not to " encourage " [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG SLV  ] program ( or other MTCR-country [ORG SLV  ] programs the [LOC U.S.  ] did not support before the advent of the [ORG Missile Technology Control Regime  ] in 1987 ) . 
However , in 1999 the [LOC U.S.  ] decided that it would be prepared to permit such launches from [LOC Alcantara  ] on [ORG Tsyklon  ] ( as well as on [LOC U.S.  ] SLVs ) if [LOC Brazil  ] would conclude a [ORG TSA  ] with the [LOC U.S.  ] that would both protect against unauthorized technology transfer and provide a credible basis for the [LOC U.S.  ] to maintain that permitting such launches would not " encourage " [LOC Brazil  ] 's own [ORG SLV  ] program. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
Such a [ORG TSA  ] was negotiated and signed in April 2000 . 
Entry into force , however , required ratification by the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Senate  ] ( for the [LOC U.S.  ] , the [ORG TSA  ] is an [ORG Executive Agreement  ] ) , which refused to ratify the [ORG TSA  ] , citing sovereignty concerns . 
In November 2003 , [LOC Brazil  ] indicated it was ready to initiate discussions with the [LOC U.S.  ] on renegotiating the April 2000 [ORG TSA  ] to address its Congress' concerns and permit ratification . 
Since then , [LOC Brazil  ] has sporadically sought [LOC U.S.  ] views on various informal renegotiation proposals . 
The latest such [MISC Brazilian  ] effort occurred in September 2005 , when the [ORG GOB  ] asked whether the USG would be prepared to resolve certain issues by means of a mutually agreed public , unilateral declaration by the [ORG GOB  ] . 
We responded in November 2005 that we would be prepared to work on this basis , as long as the total [ORG TSA  ] package preserves sufficient technical and legal safeguards , including on the political level , to address our proliferation concerns . 
We also indicated that if [LOC Brazil  ] wished to pu rsue this issue , it should get back to us with a formal renegotiation request , including specifics on the wording of the unilateral declaration . 
[LOC Brazil  ] has not raised the issue since that November 2005 discussion. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE: In response to [ORG REF  ] A request , we want to remind [MISC Ukrainian  ] officials that the [LOC U.S.  ] does not oppose establishing a [ORG Tsyklon  ] launch site at [LOC Alcantara  ] , as long as that activity does not result in the transfer of rocket technology to [LOC Brazil  ] and that [LOC U.S.  ] policy on support for this effort has not changed . 
Specifically , the [LOC U.S.  ] will be prepared to permit [ORG Tsyklon  ] to launch [LOC U.S.  ] satellites , and foreign satellites with [LOC U.S.  ] licensed components , from [LOC Alcantara  ] once our bilateral [ORG TSA  ] with [LOC Brazil  ] enters into effect. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) ACTION REQUEST: Request [ORG Embassy Brasilia  ] respond to [MISC Ukrainian  ] Embassy queries concerning the [MISC Ukrainian-Brazilian  ] space launch joint venture at [LOC Alcantara  ] , making the following points: --As we have discussed previously with your government , the [LOC U.S.  ] will be prepared to support the [MISC Ukrainian-Brazilian  ] space launch joint venture at [LOC Alcantara  ] once our bilateral [ORG Technology Safeguards Agreement  ] ( [ORG TSA  ] ) with [LOC Brazil  ] enters into effect. --However , until the [ORG TSA  ] becomes active , the [LOC U.S.  ] will not/not be prepared to permit [ORG Tsyklon  ] to launch [LOC U.S.  ] satellites and foreign satellites with [MISC U.S.-licensed  ] components from [ORG Alcantara.  ] --The [ORG TSA  ] was signed in 2000 , but [LOC Brazil  ] has been unable to ratify it to date . 
If pressed for further information on the status of our [ORG TSA  ] with [LOC Brazil  ] , post should urge [MISC Ukrainian  ] officials to discuss the issue with their [MISC Brazilian  ] partners . 
NOTE: Embassy [MISC Kyiv  ] may doubletrack this response with host government officials as appropriate .
