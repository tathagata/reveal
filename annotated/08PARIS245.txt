Pekala  ] , for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Summary . 
On February 7 , Acting U/S [PER John Rood  ] and his delegation met his [MISC French  ] and [MISC British  ] P3 counterparts , [PER Philippe Carre  ] and [PER Mariot Leslie  ] respectively , to discuss a broad range of nonproliferation , arms control and disarmament issues . 
Unusually , the [MISC French  ] were closer to the [LOC U.S.  ] than were the [MISC British  ] on most issues . 
The greatest area of divergence involved a strong [LOC UK  ] push for complete nuclear disarmament as a long term goal , including using verification measures in [MISC P5  ] countries . 
[PER Rood  ] and [PER Carre  ] expressed skepticism that this would have a significant impact either on aspiring proliferators or NGO disarmament advocates . 
They urged the [MISC British  ] to join instead in a [ORG P3  ] strategy publicizing our strong nuclear disarmament records , promoting [MISC FMCT  ] and START follow-on , and focusing on emerging threats such as nuclear terrorism . 
On missile defense , the [MISC British  ] and [MISC French  ] both praised our efforts with [LOC Russia  ] as forward-leaning , supported our post-START approach , and expressed concern about Russia’s moves to globalize the [MISC INF  ] treaty . 
The [MISC British  ] strongly supported the [LOC U.S.  ] in seeking [ORG NATO  ] endorsement in the [LOC Bucharest  ] Communique of our [LOC MD  ] efforts in [LOC Europe  ] ; the [MISC French  ] , while remaining reluctant , agreed to support language in the Communique recognizing the threat and the utility of [LOC MD  ] as one element of a response , and positively recognizing [LOC U.S.  ] interceptors and radars as the core of a [ORG NATO  ] capability . 
The [ORG P3  ] also discussed enforcement of the [ORG NPT  ] vis-a-vis [LOC Iran  ] , civil nuclear energy cooperation with [LOC India  ] , cluster munitions , a proposed [ORG UK Arms Trade Treaty  ] and difficulties with [LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC China  ] . 
The [ORG P3  ] plan to meet again in April . 
End Summary. ---------------------------------- A ( MODEST ) [MISC BRITISH  ] PROPOSAL ---------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The meeting began with general agreement that , in the last 10 to 15 years , proliferation concerns have grown and that the [ORG Nuclear Proliferation Treaty  ] ( [ORG NPT  ] ) regime is under stress . 
While aspiring proliferators such as [LOC Iran  ] constitute the primary threat , the issue of energy security ( and the acquisition of nuclear energy by non-nuclear states ) has raised a new [ORG NPT  ] dimension as well . 
U/S [PER Rood  ] stated that the [ORG USG  ] was interested in creating “rules of the road” to allow for the peaceful use of nuclear energy within the [ORG NPT  ] . 
[PER Leslie  ] agreed , adding that [LOC UK  ] FM [PER David Miliband  ] was focusing on using the new demand for nuclear energy to look at safety issues as well as building capacity ( some of which can be addressed through [ORG PSI  ] ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Participants agreed that [LOC Iran  ] is the primary problem facing the states in the [ORG NPT  ] regime . 
[PER Carre  ] stated that if the international community is unable to prevent [LOC Iran  ] from becoming a nuclear state , the [ORG NPT  ] will lose credibility . 
U/S [PER Rood  ] agreed , adding that enforcement of the [ORG NPT  ] regime must be the first priority , followed by addressing structural defects in the regime that allow nations to acquire enrichment technologies without any justification . 
[PER Leslie  ] said that , while no one was “on Iran’s side , ” some in the [ORG NAM  ] , such as [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Egypt  ] , pay lip service to [MISC Iranian  ] arguments for their own political reasons . 
All agreed that the P3 should do more to mobilize the various constituencies to promote better understanding of the threat and show that the stakes of withdrawing from the [ORG NPT  ] are high. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) There was extensive discussion about a [LOC UK  ] proposal to push for complete nuclear disarmament as a long-term goal , to include confidence-building measures by the [MISC P5  ] as a gesture of good will towards non-nuclear states suspicious of our nuclear reduction efforts . 
[PER Leslie  ] argued that there is a “political danger” within the [LOC UK  ] and in [ORG NATO  ] if the member states don’t live up to the commitments in the [ORG NPT  ] , including the final goal of a world without nuclear weapons . 
[PER Leslie  ] conceded U/S Rood’s point that a [MISC P5  ] effort of this kind would not persuade [LOC Iran  ] or other nuclear weapons aspirants to give up their nuclear ambitions , but she asserted that it would help bring countries such as [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC South Africa  ] to greater trust and support for the [MISC P5  ] in this area . 
The [LOC UK  ] is planning to circulate a draft paper with proposals in four areas to help demonstrate the [MISC P5  ] commitment to reducing nuclear arsenals . 
These areas would concentrate on: ( 1 ) Work on definitions of nuclear terms and forces ; ( 2 ) Greater transparency on warhead production and storage facilities ( that would not need to include information on current location of warheads , but more general sharing of information about historic storage facilities ) ; ( 3 ) Nuclear accident response ; and ( 4 ) Verification of disarmament through peer review of technology , including demonstrating the practice of dismantling a nuclear warhead . 
If initiated , these proposals might build support for additional [MISC P5  ] initiatives like the [LOC PARIS  ] 00000245 002 OF 004 nuclear fuel cycle program , [PER Leslie  ] said. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) U/S [PER Rood  ] and [PER Carre  ] expressed strong disagreement with the [LOC UK  ] proposal , with U/S [PER Rood  ] emphasizing that it was far better for the P3 to adopt a positive agenda by emphasizing our strong nuclear disarmament record , pursuing [MISC FMCT  ] and START follow-on , and focusing on emerging threats such as nuclear terrorism . 
U/S [PER Rood  ] questioned whether the [LOC UK  ] proposal would be counter-productive . 
No one had challenged [MISC P5  ] nuclear disarmament announcements , but focusing on verification of [MISC P5  ] steps could cast doubt on those achievements and raise questions about aspects of the dismantling such as the retention of the plutonium pits at the center of the warhead ( which actually renders it less susceptible to therft or diversion than would grinding down the material ) . 
Verification is a means of checking compliance ; it is not relevant in the context of [ORG NPT Article VI  ] , which sets no specific milestones to be checked and leaves it to the [MISC P5  ] to determine their own progress . 
U/S [PER Rood  ] asked about the demonstration effect on other countries: it could actually be de-stabilitizing for [LOC Pakistan  ] , [LOC India  ] and [LOC Israel  ] to increase transparency through verification and steps advocated by the [LOC UK  ] , such as publishing locations of nuclear weapons production and deployment . 
[PER Carre  ] agreed firmly and added that the [LOC UK  ] proposal went far beyond acceptable parameters. ---------------------------------------- [MISC CHINESE  ] AND [MISC RUSSIAN P5 PARTNERS  ] ---------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) U/S [PER Rood  ] observed that [ORG P3  ] nuclear weapons arsenals had been reduced since signing the [ORG NPT  ] in 1968 , with the [LOC U.S.  ] now at one-fourth of its stockpile at the peak of the [MISC Cold War  ] , but meanwhile [LOC China  ] is building up its nuclear arsenal and [LOC Russia  ] is placing increasing emphasis on nuclear weapons in its doctrine . 
Unfortunately , the [MISC Chinese  ] oppose a [ORG Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty  ] ( [MISC FMCT  ] ) because they wanted to preserve their freedom of action and ability to make more nuclear weapons . 
[PER Leslie  ] said that the [LOC UK  ] is less concerned about the [MISC Chinese  ] nuclear and conventional arms build-up than is the [LOC U.S.  ] , particularly with respect to [LOC Taiwan  ] , but that [LOC London  ] wants [LOC China  ] involved in the [MISC FMCT  ] process , even at the cost of a long transition period and agreement on what type of [MISC Chinese  ] arms build-up would ultimately be acceptable . 
[PER Carre  ] advocated strengthened [MISC P5  ] cooperation and said that the [MISC Chinese  ] want to be seen as “equals” with the other [MISC P5  ] members in ensuring world stability and security , and suggested this motivation could be played on to move China’s behavior closer into alignment with its own more positive rhetoric. ----------------------------------------- [LOC EGYPT  ] AND MULTILATERAL FORA ----------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Leslie  ] proposed having the [MISC P5  ] meet with [LOC Egypt  ] before the next Prepcom to allow the [ORG GOE  ] to vent its “grievances” and then perhaps engage more productively in the future . 
The [LOC UK  ] fears that the [MISC Egyptians  ] are “gearing up for a fight” if they don’t believe their concerns are being properly addressed . 
U/S [PER Rood  ] observed that [MISC Egyptian  ] tactics were backfiring ; they received fewer votes at the September 2007 [ORG IAEA  ] general conference than the year before and seemed genuinely surprised . 
Furthermore , it is not in their interest to remove the ambiguity of [MISC Israel’s  ] nuclear status which was stabilizing to the region . 
[PER Carre  ] agreed and said that there was no benefit to weakening the [MISC Israeli  ] pledge not to be the first to use nuclear weapons in the [LOC Middle East.  ] ----------------------------------------- [LOC INDIA  ] ----------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Carre  ] opened the subject of civil nuclear energy cooperation by noting that [LOC France  ] had recently initialed an agreement on this subject with the government of [LOC India  ] . 
The provisions of the [MISC French-Indian  ] agreement were similar to those in the [MISC U.S.-India  ] agreement and the process had presented fewer problems than expected . 
The [ORG GOF  ] had repeatedly emphasized to the [ORG GOI  ] that [LOC India  ] must obtain the approval of the [ORG IAEA  ] and there would be no shortcuts or special exceptions . 
U/S [PER Rood  ] said that the [ORG USG  ] strongly believes that language on safeguards in perpetuity should not be made conditional on fuel supply and we had informed the [ORG IAEA  ] of our position . 
The [ORG GOI  ] was still testing the will of the international community to find flexibility on this . 
[PER Leslie  ] affirmed that the [LOC UK  ] was in agreement with both the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC France  ] on this issue and the [MISC British  ] would be concerned if [LOC India  ] obtained an agreement in which safeguards could lapse if fuel supplies were disrupted . 
She doubted that the [ORG GOI  ] would complete the necessary steps this year . 
[LOC PARIS  ] 00000245 003 OF 004 Furthermore , [LOC China  ] was not blocking progress on [MISC Indian  ] civil nuclear cooperation , but the [LOC UK  ] fully expects that they will raise the case of [LOC Pakistan  ] as soon as the [MISC Indian  ] situation is resolved. ----------------------------------------- POST-START AND MISSILE DEFENSE ----------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) U/S [PER Rood  ] noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] is continuing discussions with [LOC Russia  ] on a post-START regime . 
Both [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] did not want to simply extend the current agreement , which is both cumbersome and expensive . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] wanted to draft a new agreement based on the [ORG Moscow Treaty  ] . 
Unfortunately , [LOC Russia  ] wanted conventional weapons to be limited under the agreement as well . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] does not agree ; as a compromise , in October we proposed a legally binding treaty with transparency and confidence-building measures . 
However , in the run up to the [MISC Russian  ] presidential election , the [MISC Russians  ] are in no mood to compromise . 
We do not support further efforts on global [MISC INF.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) On Missile Defense , [PER Carre  ] observed that the [MISC Russians  ] realized the issue was more complicated than they initially believed . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] offer not to activate the system until the threat matured showed that the [LOC MD  ] system in [LOC Europe  ] was not oriented towards [LOC Russia  ] . 
Unfortunately , in the [MISC Russian  ] government the more moderate diplomatic voices were marginalized by the power of the [MISC Russian  ] military . 
[PER Carre  ] said that [LOC France  ] had recognized the missile threat and agreed that missile defense was one element of a broad response to this threat . 
The [MISC French  ] regard the [LOC U.S.  ] interceptors and radars as the logical core of a [ORG NATO  ] capability . 
However , an endorsement at [ORG NATO  ] raises consequences that the [MISC French  ] believe need to be carefully considered . 
For example , [LOC Bulgaria  ] and [LOC Turkey  ] were already raising the need for collective financing of an additional NATO-linked system , saying that it was required under [MISC NATO’s  ] treaty ensuring collective defense. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In response , U/S [PER Rood  ] said that there are many examples where individual states have different capabilities that they bring to the Alliance that do not require common funding . 
A [ORG NATO  ] endorsement of [LOC MD  ] at [LOC Bucharest  ] would simply note that the [LOC U.S.  ] system in [LOC Europe  ] exists and forms the core of a future Alliance capability . 
It does not commit the Alliance to any programmatic costs or a common funding mechanism . 
It is fully in keeping with other weapons programs developed by the allies and would ensure that there is no divisability of security . 
[PER Leslie  ] agreed , saying that if the threat is recognized and missile defense is effective in combating such a threat , then the alliance should not hesitate to endorse missile defense . 
The [LOC UK  ] does not see the [ORG NATO  ] endorsement as any commitment to actual expenditure , but merely a commitment to the principle. ------------------------------------ CLUSTER MUNITIONS ------------------------------------ <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) U/S [PER Rood  ] emphasized that the international community was making progress in addressing cluster munitions concerns in the [MISC UN-authorized Convention  ] on Conventional [PER Weaposn  ] ( [ORG CCW  ] ) process . 
The [ORG USG  ] was concerned about Norway’s efforts to go outside this multilateral track via the “Oslo Process.” We believe this is both impractical and unconstructive and would prefer that other countries not participate in this outside mechanism . 
[PER Leslie  ] responded that the [LOC UK  ] was participating in both the [ORG CCW  ] and the [ORG Oslo Process  ] as a “tactical maneuver” designed to keep activity within the bounds of their “redlines” and at the same time , keep the [ORG CCW  ] alive . 
The [LOC UK  ] wants to keep the “smart” type of cluster munitions and would not agree to phase out anything without a transitional period . 
At the same time , the [LOC UK  ] is concerned about the impact of the [ORG Oslo Process  ] on the aftermath of a conflict ( foreseeing “astronomical bills” handed out to those who used cluster munitions in the past ) . 
[PER Carre  ] said that [LOC France  ] could not afford to ignore the [ORG Oslo Process  ] given the political power of the NGOs on this issue , but like the [LOC UK  ] they hope to affect the debate as a participant . 
Cluster munitions have also attracted the attention of FM [ORG Kouchner  ] and the [MISC French  ] government is under “heavy domestic pressure” to take action . 
Unfortunately , once cluster munitions are declared to be unacceptable , it is hard to argue that we still need to use them for awhile. -------------------------------------- [ORG ARMS TRADE TREATY  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Finally , [PER Leslie  ] raised the issue of the proposed [LOC PARIS  ] 00000245 004 OF 004 Arms Trade Treaty , saying their motives for support for this agreement were clear and they hoped it could be used to raise the standards of other states and create a more responsible arms trade . 
As the treaty would deal with export of arms , it should not run afoul of [LOC U.S.  ] constitutional concerns as it would not limit the [LOC U.S.  ] citizen constitutional right to bear arms . 
[PER Carre  ] agreed that there was scope for something to be done to further regulate arms transfers . 
U/S [PER Rood  ] observed that while encouraging responsible behavior in arms transfers in general was good , the risk with a treaty was than an unacceptably low standard for arms transfers would result . 
[PER Rood  ] also said that the [LOC U.S.  ] had concerns about any potential impact on second amendment rights. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 .
