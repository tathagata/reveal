( C ) Independent [ORG MP  ] Ala [PER Abdel Manaam  ] told us he submitted documents and other evidence to the Public Prosecutor in January 2009 attesting to [PER Soliman  ] 's gifts of valuable public land to family members , and various corrupt real estate deals involving senior [ORG GOE  ] officials . 
[PER Ahmed Al-Naggar  ] , an analyst specializing in corruption issues at the [ORG GOE-funded Al-Ahram Center  ] , told us that as Housing Minister [PER Soliman  ] tried to give the Press Syndicate a [ORG LE  ] 3 million ( USD 525,000 ) bribe in 2005 to exclude a particular consulting engineer from a real estate deal between the syndicate and the ministry . 
According to [ORG NGO  ] contacts , starting in about 2002 [LOC CAIRO  ] 00000203 002 OF 002 [PER Soliman  ] began raising eyebrows by publicly discussing his lucrative land deals , including a public boast that he owned seven villas. --------------------------------------------- ---- A History of [ORG GOE Support  ] for [PER Soliman  ] --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Until recently , the [ORG GOE  ] had a history of backing [PER Soliman  ] . 
According to [ORG NGO  ] contacts and press reports , President [PER Mubarak  ] presented [PER Soliman  ] in 2005 with a prestigious award , " The [ORG First Class Medal  ] of the [LOC Republic  ] , " following his departure from the housing ministry after 12 years of service . 
Human rights attorney [PER Siah Mahfouz  ] said the [ORG GOE  ] certified in a 2006 mandatory review that all [PER Soliman  ] 's earnings were legal during his tenure as housing minister , and backed him in his successful 2005 parliamentary race . 
Human rights activist [PER Engi Haddad  ] who worked with presidential son [PER Gamal Mubarak  ] in the ruling [ORG National Democratic Party  ] told us [PER Gamal  ] pushed in 2003 and 2004 for [PER Soliman  ] 's ouster from the housing ministry , but President [PER Mubarak  ] resisted before easing [PER Soliman  ] out in 2005 . 
[PER Haddad  ] believed [PER Soliman  ] had a " close , personal relationship " with President [PER Mubarak.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOE  ] 's most recent show of support for [PER Soliman  ] - appointing him in June 2009 as CEO of the [ORG government-owned Petroleum Marine Services  ] Company - rankled the group of independent MPs who filed the January 2009 criminal complaint against [PER Soliman  ] . 
The MPs responded by requesting an investigation into the appointment 's violation of law 159 ( 1984 ) , which prohibits MPs from directing companies or serving on boards , except under extraordinary circumstances . 
[PER Manaam  ] believed [PER Soliman  ] 's television appearance in December 2009 defending himself by touting his ties to President [PER Mubarak  ] embarrassed [PER Mubarak  ] , and caused [PER Mubarak  ] to finally withdraw his support . 
Press reports that the Public Prosecutor had opened an investigation of [PER Soliman  ] for corruption began to appear on January 2. ------------------- [PER Soliman  ] 's Fate -------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Manaam  ] told us he believes [PER Mubarak  ] is now unwilling to block an investigation because [PER Soliman  ] " had gone too far " in asserting his ties to [PER Mubarak  ] on television . 
[PER Manaam  ] believed the documentary and other evidence against [PER Soliman  ] is strong , and he was certain the Public Prosecutor would file charges against [PER Soliman  ] and order a trial . 
In contrast , several [ORG NGO  ] contacts expected the Public Prosecutor would " freeze " the investigation of [PER Soliman  ] as a result of [ORG GOE  ] pressure . 
They believed the [ORG GOE  ] would not allow the case to move forward because of fears that [PER Soliman  ] could implicate senior [ORG GOE  ] officials involved in his corrupt deals .
