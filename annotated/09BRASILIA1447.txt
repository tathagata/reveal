End summary . 
[ORG Presidential Foreign Policy Advisor Garcia Focuses  ] on [LOC Honduras...  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In a long and friendly meeting , [ORG Presidential Foreign Policy Advisor Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] laid out [LOC Brazil  ] 's position and ongoing concerns regarding [LOC Honduras  ] . 
He said President [PER Zelaya  ] 's decision to go abroad had given [LOC Brazil  ] greater " flexibility " in dealing with the crisis . 
[LOC Brazil  ] believes it is essential for de facto leader [PER Micheletti  ] to step down , and [PER Garcia  ] expressed his hopes that the [ORG USG  ] would " turn the screws " on him . 
Personally , [PER Garcia  ] said he thought a constituent assembly would be a way to give legitimacy to the political solution being crafted. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) A/S [PER Valenzuela  ] disagreed with [PER Garcia  ] 's assertion that the [LOC Honduras  ] crisis had created " a division " between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Latin America  ] . 
Rather , he said the failed effort by [LOC Mexico  ] to gain safe passage for [PER Zelaya  ] out of the country , of which the [ORG USG  ] had not been informed and which had negatively affected other efforts on [PER Zelaya  ] 's behalf , demonstrated the need for more fluid communication . 
In later discussions at [ORG Itamaraty  ] , [LOC Honduras  ] was also a leading topic of conversation . 
There , officials insisted that they had no contact with the [PER Micheletti  ] regime and that their ability to influence [PER Zelaya  ] was limited. ...Proposes [LOC U.S.  ] Visit to [MISC Venezuela...  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Garcia  ] made a point to reiterate a suggestion he had made to [ORG NSA General Jones  ] , that [PER Valenzuela  ] should go to [LOC Caracas  ] to establish a " direct link " and relationship with President [PER Chavez  ] . 
Without such a move , [PER Garcia  ] said , " [PER Chavez  ] will respond to everyone " ( i.e. , to [ORG USG  ] officials whatever their position ) ; " he has no sense of proportion . 
" [PER Garcia  ] said that , because of " ambiguity " and " a bad process , " the issue of the [LOC Colombia  ] bases had complicated matters in the region . 
Although the November 27 meeting of the [MISC South American Defense Council  ] ( [ORG SADC  ] ) had reduced tensions , the idea that the bases might be used to launch an action against [LOC Venezuela  ] " was common . 
" Neither [LOC Colombia  ] nor [LOC Venezuela  ] was willing to make a goodwill gesture toward the other , and [LOC Brazil  ] 's efforts to mediate had been rebuffed by both sides . 
He predicted that [LOC Venezuela  ] " will maintain the pressure " on [LOC Colombia  ] for several months . 
[MISC Venezuelan  ] FM [PER Maduro  ] had indicated to [PER Garcia  ] that a visit by A/S [PER Valenzuela  ] would be " no problem " to arrange ; [PER Garcia  ] felt it would help reduce tensions and improve dialogue with the region . 
A/S [PER Valenzuela  ] was noncommittal , and noted that it is difficult to ignore both the provocative statements by [PER Chavez  ] and his authoritarian tendencies. ...Assesses Regional Developments... <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Over the course of the conversation , [PER Garcia  ] expressed a [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001447 002 OF 005 preference for former President [PER Frei  ] in [LOC Chile  ] 's elections ; described [LOC Ecuador  ] 's and [LOC Bolivia  ] 's political systems as " rotten " ; said that [LOC Mujica  ] 's election in [LOC Uruguay  ] was good as he would be " more active " ; and called the future of [LOC Argentina  ] " a big question mark , " depending on whether the Kirchners recover or not , although he did not foresee problems for relations with [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[PER Garcia  ] hoped to " revive [MISC Mercosur  ] " during the upcoming [MISC Argentine  ] presidency . 
With regard to relations with the [LOC United States  ] , [PER Garcia  ] noted that the " delay " in [ORG USG  ] initiatives toward the region caused frustration and disappointment. .. . 
And [LOC Indicates Middle East Peace  ] and [LOC Iran  ] Top [LOC Brazil  ] 's Global Agenda <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Beyond [LOC Latin America  ] , [PER Garcia  ] described [LOC Brazil  ] 's priorities as climate change and expanding participation in the [LOC Middle East  ] peace process " to put more air " into them . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is concerned with the success of the [MISC Israel-Palestine  ] peace process both because of the impact on its own global interests and because it " contaminates " other issues in the region-including [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[PER Garcia  ] said [LOC Brazil  ] has encouraged [LOC Iran  ] to use its influence with [ORG Hamas  ] to help move the process forward . 
With regard to [LOC Iran  ] itself , [PER Garcia  ] described [LOC Brazil  ] 's engagement as " a bet " that might not work . 
In light of President [PER Obama  ] 's request to help , [LOC Brazil  ] is trying to build a relationship with [LOC Iran  ] . 
He described [LOC Brazil  ] 's reception of President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] in November as " not warm " and stressed that President [PER Lula  ] had delivered " direct messages . 
" [LOC Brazil  ] is encouraging [LOC Iran  ] to " submit to the rules , " regarding non-proliferation , but [LOC Brazil  ] had abstained on the recent [ORG IAEA  ] vote on [LOC Iran  ] as because of the timing ; a vote in favor at that moment would have neutralized their efforts to sway [LOC Iran  ] . 
In [LOC Brazil  ] 's view , the worst thing to do is to further isolate [LOC Iran  ] . 
A/S [PER Valenzuela  ] welcomed [LOC Brazil  ] 's efforts to encourage [LOC Iran  ] to comply with its international obligations but expressed serious concerns with their nuclear aspirations . 
He emphasized that [LOC Iran  ] had a deficit of trust with the international community but assured [PER Garcia  ] that the [ORG Administration  ] would continue to try to engage [LOC Iran  ] , despite the difficulties . 
[PER Itamaraty: Eager  ] to Move Forward Bilaterally... <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Over lunch with Under Secretary for Political Affairs [PER Vera Machado  ] and acting Under Secretary for [LOC Latin America  ] [PER GonC'alo MourC#o  ] , and in a separate meeting with newly installed Deputy Minister and former ambassador to the [LOC United States  ] [PER AntC4nio Patriota  ] , [MISC Brazilian  ] officials stressed the need to move forward in expanding our bilateral relationship . 
[PER Patriota  ] cited the high-level dialogue we are hoping to start and said the GOB is glad there is a broadening of the bilateral political agenda to match the excellent dialogue on the economic side . 
With regard to current cooperation , he praised the [ORG Economic Policy Dialogue  ] , under way at the same time in [LOC Washington  ] , and said that [PER Civilian Household  ] ( Prime ) Minister [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] wants to see more bilateral cooperation on biofuels . 
He highlighted the success of the [ORG Joint Action Plan  ] to eliminate racial and ethnic discrimination ( [ORG JAPER  ] ) and suggested creating linkages with the [ORG CEO Forum  ] . 
Both he and [PER Machado  ] said [LOC Brazil  ] has much to learn from the [LOC United States  ] regarding inclusion of civil society and the private sector in such initiatives . 
[PER Patriota  ] noted the meeting of the [ORG Brazil Studies Association  ] ( [ORG BRASA  ] ) next year as a good opportunity to do some cross-fertilization between private sector and social initiatives . 
[PER Patriota  ] hoped we could increase discussions on other social issues , including human rights and advancement of women. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Patriota  ] and [PER Machado  ] both expressed interest in moving forward with the [ORG Defense Cooperation Agreement  ] ( [ORG DCA  ] ) and asked for serious consideration of language [LOC Brazil  ] had just proposed on " guarantees " of respect for sovereignty of third countries , which [LOC Brazil  ] was seeking to add in light of concerns over the [ORG U.S.-Colombia DCA  ] and commitments made at the November 27 meeting of the [LOC South America Defense Council  ] . 
[LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001447 003 OF 005 <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Although even the suggestion of work on terrorism-related programs has caused problems in [LOC Brazil  ] for some [ORG USG  ] agencies , [PER Machado  ] acknowledged that [LOC Brazil  ] would need to address potential terrorism issues with [LOC Brazil  ] 's hosting of the 2014 [MISC World Cup  ] and the 2016 [MISC Olympics  ] . 
A/S [PER Valenzuela  ] said the [ORG USG  ] is willing to cooperate and assist in any way we can and he suggested that State and [ORG Itamaraty  ] should increase our effort to coordinate cooperation among our various agencies in advance of these events . 
[ORG ChargC  ] ) d'Affaires Kubiske noted that the [MISC Olympics  ] also open an avenue for cooperation to advance social issues , for example , by ensuring that efforts are made to secure [MISC English  ] training and jobs for minorities and the poor. ...Regionally... <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) A/S [PER Valenzuela  ] stressed that Secretary [PER Clinton  ] is committed to working closely and more intently on [LOC Haiti  ] . 
The [LOC United States  ] can benefit from [LOC Brazil  ] 's expertise in [LOC Haiti  ] and the region , he said . 
Acting [PER U/S MourC#o  ] said [LOC Brazil  ] 's focus in [LOC Haiti  ] is on policing , as it is important to strengthen [LOC Haiti  ] 's law enforcement capabilities . 
[PER Patriota  ] noted the efforts of [LOC USAID  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Cooperation Agency  ] ( [ORG ABC  ] ) to establish joint projects . 
He recalled that , in the second paragraph of President [PER Lula  ] 's letter to President [PER Obama  ] last month , he had mentioned the priority of constructing a hydroelectric dam and plant . 
Although the letter had suggested a cost of $150 million to build , [PER Patriota  ] believed it would actually cost $250 million . 
He felt this would be an important project for the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] to work on jointly. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) During lunch , [PER Machado  ] asked if [LOC Bolivia  ] might be re-certified next year for counternarcotics cooperation . 
A/S [PER Valenzuela  ] noted some very strong [LOC U.S.  ] opposition to this , but said that strong communication with the [ORG Morales  ] government is essential and suggested that there is now an opportunity for trilateral cooperation on counternarcotics . 
[PER Machado  ] raised the 3+1 [ORG Security Dialogue  ] between [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Argentina  ] , [LOC Paraguay  ] , and the [LOC United States  ] , saying the name of the talks should be changed to avoid a sense of opposition. ...And Globally <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Patriota  ] indicated [LOC Brazil  ] 's interest in expanding " trilateral cooperation " between [LOC Brazil  ] , the [LOC United States  ] , and third countries as a particularly valuable form of engagement , particularly in [LOC Africa  ] . 
As [LOC Brazil  ] is entering the [ORG Security Council  ] in January , the GOB wants to coordinate agendas with the [ORG USG  ] and engage more on [ORG Security Council  ] reform . 
Looking ahead to the [ORG NPT Review Conference  ] and [ORG Nuclear Security Summit  ] , [PER Patriota  ] described President [PER Obama  ] 's speech in [LOC Prague  ] on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament as " groundbreaking " and said it was very well received in [LOC Brazil  ] .

Defense Minister [PER Jobim  ] Describes [LOC Brazil  ] 's Concern with [LOC Regional Stability...  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Following a one-on-one meeting , a friendly and engaged [PER DefMin Jobim  ] was joined by senior military personnel for a broad discussion of regional issues . 
[PER Jobim  ] raised the [ORG U.S.-Colombia DCA  ] , saying that , from a strictly [MISC Brazilian  ] point of view , there was no problem . 
The region was " sensitive , " however , and as [LOC Brazil  ] has no [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001447 004 OF 005 problems with any of its neighbors , it tries to be a " moderator " among them . 
[PER Jobim  ] had made an enormous effort , along with [ORG Itamaraty  ] and President [PER Lula  ] , to visit all [MISC South American  ] countries to gain agreement to establish the [MISC South American  ] Defense Council , which would help create a regional identity on defense issues , advance " military diplomacy , " link defense to the real economy by establishing niches for each country in defense industries , and encourage exchanges among military academies. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Noting our common concern with stability in the region , A/S [PER Valenzuela  ] asked how [PER Jobim  ] viewed the situation between [LOC Colombia  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] and the situation in [LOC Paraguay  ] . 
[PER Jobim  ] said that he did not see the tensions escalating , but that [PER Lula  ] 's efforts to mediate a discussion between [PER Chavez  ] and [PER Uribe  ] had not been successful . 
With regard to [LOC Paraguay  ] , he said that for political reasons [LOC Brazil  ] had made concessions on the price it was paying for energy from [LOC Itaipu  ] and would finance the construction of a transmission facility on the [MISC Paraguayan  ] side of the border . 
" This is part of the game " with [LOC Paraguay  ] , he said . 
[PER Jobim  ] encouraged A/S [PER Valenzuela  ] to continue this dialogue on regional stability . 
He said the [LOC United States  ] needs to be " re-introduced " to [LOC Latin America  ] ; although it might be a false impression , there is a feeling in the region that the [LOC United States  ] needs to build more trust following a " difficult era " in the [LOC Bush Administration.  ] ...And Provides an Update on [ORG FX2 Fighter Competition  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 .

He was awaiting additional documentation from [ORG Boeing  ] later in the week and was particularly intrigued by the possibilities of the [MISC Global Super Hornet  ] program . 
[PER Jobim  ] noted the importance of the purchase in [LOC Brazil  ] 's national defense strategy , adding that technology transfer is the main consideration and the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" precedents " on this score are not good ; but he acknowledged that the portfolio of transfer items was large and that it was a new [LOC U.S.  ] government . 
[PER Jobim  ] reiterated the five criteria they will be using to make a decision: the quality of the platform , the technology being offered , the training being offered , the price , and the life-cycle cost . 
A/S [PER Valenzuela  ] assured him the [ORG Boeing  ] was best on all counts . 
Political Analysts See [ORG Less Aggressive Foreign Policy Post-Lula  ] <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( U ) Three leading political analysts told [PER A/S Valenzuela  ] that [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] , President [PER Lula  ] 's choice to succeed him in 2011 , has at least a break-even chance of winning the October 2010 elections , despite [ORG Serra  ] 's lead in the polls . 
They expect that many of the GOB 's current foreign policy positions - including on [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Honduras  ] - are facilitated by [PER Lula  ] 's strong internal position and personal reputation , and will not outlast his presidency . 
They described in detail the failure of the delegation of [MISC Iranian  ] businessmen that accompanied [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , and argued that attempts by [PER Rousseff  ] or anyone other than [PER Lula  ] to engage authoritarian states in such a high-profile manner would not be tolerated domestically , as it is seen as a departure from [LOC Brazil  ] 's traditionally cautious approach to such matters . 
A [ORG Serra  ] presidency , they believed , would not alter [LOC Brazil  ] 's basic economic strategy but would lead to a return to more traditional [MISC Brazilian  ] foreign policy stances , especially in [LOC Latin America  ] . 
Media Coverage Goes From Nervous and Negative to Hopeful and Positive <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( SBU ) In advance of [PER A/S Valenzuela  ] 's trip , media coverage focused on " tensions " in the bilateral relationship , highlighting [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001447 005 OF 005 differences over [LOC Honduras  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , climate change , and non-proliferation . 
However , following a press roundtable by A/S [PER Valenzuela  ] with leading news dailies and weeklies and comments to the press by both [PER Garcia  ] and [ORG Itamaraty  ] officials , press reports on Tuesday , December 15 highlighted apparent points of agreement on [LOC Honduras  ] and [LOC Iran  ] . 
[LOC BrasC-lia  ] daily [ORG Correio Braziliense  ] ran one of the most powerful headlines: " Disagreements Between Good Allies . 
" These reports were reinforced by equally positive headlines in online coverage from major news portals such as [ORG UOL  ] and [ORG Terra.  ] <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( U ) Although articles began to reappear within days reporting views from both [LOC Washington  ] and [LOC BrasC-lia  ] that tensions persist in the bilateral relationship , prominent columnists have supported the conclusion that [PER Valenzuela  ] 's visit put the [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] relationship on a new footing . 
One of the more forceful columns came from [ORG Folha  ] de [LOC SC#o Paulo  ] 's [PER Eliane Catanhede  ] , who highlighted the contrast between the prior expressions of " frustration " and " disappointment " from [PER Amorim  ] and [PER Garcia  ] , and the much more friendly remarks they made during his visit . 
Her conclusion was that the GOB knows who is really in charge on issues such as [LOC Honduras  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , and [MISC Copenhagen:  ] " This is how diplomacy is done: [PER Valenzuela  ] was in [LOC BrasC-lia  ] yesterday ; Secretary [PER Hillary Clinton  ] is on her way ; [PER Obama  ] should be here early in 2010 . 
Deep down , [PER Lula  ] , [PER Amorim  ] , [PER Jobim  ] , [PER Garcia  ] , and [ former [ORG Itamaraty  ] Secretary General ; current Minister of [ORG Strategic Planning  ] ] [PER Samuel  ] [ [PER Pinheiro Guimaraes  ] ] may bark , but they never bite . 
And the 'pitbull' [ the [LOC United States  ] ] knows its own strength . 
" [MISC Youth Ambassadors Meeting Opens  ] the Door for [ORG New Media Outreach  ] <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( U ) A/S [PER Valenzuela  ] met with alumni of the [MISC Youth Ambassadors  ] , Student Leader Exchange , and [MISC English  ] Immersion programs in an informal gathering hosted by [PER CDA Kubiske  ] . 
[PER Valenzuela  ] explained his role in over-seeing policy for the [ORG Western Hemisphere  ] and fielded questions from the young leaders on issues ranging from the value of youth exchange programs , to the [PER Obama  ] administration 's approach to [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] relations and the best way to work with the various types of democratic systems found in the region . 
" I think it was a great opportunity to meet Dr. [PER Valenzuela  ] and discuss [MISC Brazil-U.S  ] relations...it 's interesting to see how diplomacy engages youth , " said 2008 Youth Ambassador , [PER Pedro Henrique Torres  ] after his discussion with the Assistant Secretary . 
The [ORG Public Affairs Section  ] posted photos of the meeting on the [ORG Mission  ] 's Flickr site that were also carried on the Assistant Secretary 's newly launched blog . 
[ORG PA  ] recorded the event and will create short clips to post on the [ORG Mission  ] 's [ORG YouTube  ] channel and to distribute to youth contacts. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 .
