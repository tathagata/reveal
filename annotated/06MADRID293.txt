<code><pre>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 [ORG MADRID  ] 000293 SIPDIS SENSITIVE SIPDIS E.O. 12958: N/A TAGS: <a href='/tag/PGOV_0.html'>PGOV</a> <a href='/tag/PTER_0.html'>PTER</a> <a href='/tag/SP_0.html'>SP</a> SUBJECT: SPAIN: CHIEF PROSECUTOR FORCED TO QUIT <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) Attorney General [PER Candido Conde Pumpido  ] forced the Chief Prosecutor of [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG National Court  ] , [PER Eduardo Fungairino  ] , to step down for alleged mismanagement of terrorism cases under his supervision . 
[PER Fungairino  ] , a highly-respected 26-year veteran of the [ORG National Court  ] , will move to a position with the [ORG Supreme Court  ] and retain a role in terrorism cases . 
[PER Fungairino  ] 's deputy , [PER Jesus Santos  ] , will take over duties as Chief Prosecutor , at least on until a successor is named . 
[PER Conde Pumpido  ] remonstrated [PER Fungairino  ] for failing to secure [ORG Supreme Court  ] confirmation of the sentences of al-Qa'ida members convicted in September 2005 ( thus allowing two terrorists to exit prison after having served only half of their sentences ) and for failing to push for the completion of the 2004 [ORG Madrid  ] train bombing investigation . 
However , [PER Fungairino  ] 's supporters claim that the [ORG Zapatero  ] government removed [PER Fungairino  ] because of his strong opposition to a negotiated settlement with [ORG ETA  ] , negotiations that may require the cooperation of the [ORG National Prosecutor  ] 's office. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) The story immediately developed political overtones , with the Socialist-leaning " [ORG El Pais  ] " running lengthy descriptions of [PER Fungairino  ] 's failings and incompetence and serving as a platform for [PER Conde Pumpido  ] 's version of events . 
[PER Conde Pumpido  ] accused [PER Fungairino  ] of failing to consult with colleagues and of dominating judicial relations with the [ORG U.S. Department of Justice  ] and with [ORG EU  ] counterparts . 
The centrist " [ORG El Mundo  ] , " which is strongly anti-ETA , ran a headline declaring that [PER Fungairino  ] was a removed for impeding government negotiations with [ORG ETA  ] . 
" [ORG El Mundo  ] " suggested that [PER Conde Pumpido  ] decided to dismiss [PER Fungairino  ] because he had blocked the banned [ORG ETA  ] front group [ORG Batasuna  ] from holding a public meeting , despite hints from [ORG Zapatero  ] that such a meeting might be allowed in the interest of steering [ORG ETA  ] towards the political arena . 
The opposition [ORG Popular Party  ] and center-right judicial organizations rose to [PER Fungairino  ] 's defense , while center-left groups and [MISC Basque  ] nationalist organizations hailed the dismissal. //EARLY RELEASE OF CONVICTED TERRORISTS// <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) The main failure cited by [PER Conde Pumpido  ] - the early release of convicted terrorists - is troubling , but responsibility for the issue rests with several actors . 
Under [MISC Spanish  ] law , a detainee must be released after serving half their maximum prison term if the sentences have not been confirmed by the [ORG Supreme Court  ] . 
The problem in this instance is that many of the detainees in the [MISC Barakat Yarkas  ] case were held in pre-trial detention for nearly four years , time that counts towards their sentences . 
Since many of those convicted received jail terms of eight or fewer years ( see full listing in para 5 ) , the half-way point came nearly immediately after their September 2005 convictions , giving the notoriously slow [MISC Spanish  ] legal system little time to win confirmation of the convictions by the [ORG Supreme Court  ] . 
It was up to both the Prosecutor 's office and the [ORG Supreme Court  ] to shuttle the cases through , and they failed to do so in time to prevent the release of two al-Qa'ida cell members . 
The government is expected to move quickly now to prevent further releases. //COMMENT// <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Embassy  ] has enjoyed a close , collaborative relationship with [PER Fungairino  ] for many years . 
While it is true that he sometimes seemed to have difficulty delegating responsibility , he was also seen as a key leader by many [MISC Spanish  ] prosecutors and a brilliant legal strategist . 
It appears that his personal and political differences with [PER Conde Pumpido  ] were the main cause of his removal , though the inability to prevent the early release of the terrorist convicts is difficult to defend . 
Regardless of the political motives surrounding [PER Fungairino  ] 's removal , his departure will hurt [MISC U.S.-Spain  ] judicial cooperation , at least in the short term . 
[PER Fungairino  ] was a devoted anti-terrorism activist who pursued close cooperation with the [ORG USG  ] and with [ORG EU  ] allies in terrorism cases . 
One piece of good news is that [PER Fungairino  ] will reportedly remain a member of the [ORG U.S.-Spain Bilateral Counterterrorism Experts Working Group  ] , where he has played a positive role in smoothing over conflicts generated by differences in the [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] judicial systems . 
Also , [PER Jesus Santos  ] , [PER Fungairino  ] 's temporary replacement , is well and favorably known to the [ORG Embassy  ] . 
However , this does not outweigh the loss of so valuable an interlocutor in the [ORG National Prosecutor  ] 's office. //TERRORIST SENTENCES - POSSIBLE RELEASE DATES// <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 .
