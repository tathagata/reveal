( C/NF ) Madam Secretary: President [PER Sarkozy  ] , Foreign Minister [PER Kouchner  ] , and [ORG U.S Embassy Paris  ] look forward to welcoming you on your first bilateral trip to [LOC France  ] as Secretary of State . 
Your visit is taking place at a time that many consider to be one of the best periods in [MISC Franco-American  ] relations . 
Coming on the heels of the highly visible [LOC London  ] conference on [LOC Afghanistan  ] , we anticipate intense media interest in you , your visit , and the speech you will be making on [MISC European  ] security issues . 
Your meetings with the President , [ORG National Security Advisor  ] , and Foreign Minister , as well as your policy speech , will help us reinforce the need for increased [MISC French  ] engagement in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , consolidate support for next steps on [LOC Iran  ] , manage expectations on the [LOC Middle East  ] peace process , exchange latest views on [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC China  ] , promote cooperation on [LOC Haiti  ] humanitarian assistance and work toward our counter- terrorism and non-proliferation goals . 
Your visit will also be an opportunity to demonstrate our close ties with two publicly " pro-American " [MISC French  ] leaders and to express deep appreciation of [LOC France  ] as a major bilateral partner on global issues . 
End Summary. ------------------ DOMESTIC SITUATION ------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) President [PER Sarkozy  ] will not face re-election until 2012 and his [ORG UMP  ] party currently controls both houses of Parliament . 
His domestic political opposition remains divided and leaderless . 
Regional elections scheduled for late March will test [PER Sarkozy  ] 's continuing levels of political support , and we are seeing increased political posturing as those campaigns get underway nationwide . 
Responsibility for foreign affairs decisions is highly concentrated in the activist [MISC French  ] President , whose impatience with slower diplomatic processes is legendary . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] is a firm believer that it takes the personal intervention of leaders to cut through bureaucratic resistance and to achieve necessary results , a worldview that pre- disposes him to propose high-level summits on everything from the [LOC Middle East  ] to [MISC European  ] security . 
Despite their differing personalities and political parties , [PER Kouchner  ] and [PER Sarkozy  ] have developed a good working relationship , with [PER Kouchner  ] supporting his President and carving out complementary areas of responsibility , focusing on humanitarian affairs , the [LOC Balkans  ] , [LOC Africa  ] , and [MISC Syria-Lebanon  ] . 
While there is some media speculation about a possible cabinet re-shuffle after the March elections , any final decision on the Foreign Minister 's portfolio will have to take into account that [PER Kouchner  ] remains one of the most popular politicians in [LOC France  ] . 
Both [PER Sarkozy  ] and [PER Kouchner  ] , as well as [PER NSA Levitte  ] , are unabashedly " pro- [MISC American  ] , " which is refreshing after years of [MISC French  ] politicians defining [MISC French  ] power in opposition to , rather than cooperation with , [MISC American  ] power. ----------------------------------- AFGHANISTAN: COMMITTED BUT SKEPTICAL ----------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) [LOC Afghanistan  ] will be an intense focus of interest as your visit immediately follows the [LOC London  ] conference , which President [PER Sarkozy  ] has been pushing as a way to help sell [MISC French  ] engagement in [LOC Afghanistan  ] to a skeptical public . 
While [PER Sarkozy  ] said very publicly in October 2009 that [LOC France  ] would " not send one soldier more to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , " he has reiterated publicly , as recently as January 22 , his commitment that [LOC France  ] will remain in [LOC Afghanistan  ] " as long as necessary " to complete [ORG NATO  ] 's mission in support of the [MISC Afghan  ] people . 
It remains unclear , however , whether [LOC France  ] will make new public announcements of [MISC French  ] contributions to [LOC Afghanistan  ] in advance of the March elections . 
While [LOC France  ] does not have the more virulent and active opposition to the war that you see in some [MISC European  ] countries , the most recent public opinion polls show that over 80 percent of the [MISC French  ] public is opposed to the deployment of troops in [LOC PARIS  ] 00000079 002 OF 005 [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
With over 3,750 soldiers in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC France  ] is currently the fourth largest contributor of troops to [ORG ISAF  ] and has lost 39 soldiers in the war , several very recently . 
The [MISC French  ] were recently embarrassed by the withdrawal of [LOC France  ] 's candidate to become the [ORG EU Special  ] Representative to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , but they hope that naming a new [ORG UN  ] Special Representative and [ORG NATO  ] Senior Civilian Representative will send a strong signal of unity and improve overall civilian coordination in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[LOC Paris  ] supports a follow-on meeting in [LOC Kabul  ] , but [MISC French  ] officials believe that it should not take place too soon , the better to allow the [MISC Afghan  ] government to form its full cabinet and develop of detailed work program. ---------------------------------- IRAN: FRANCE'S STRONG STANCE ---------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) Driven by a personal conviction that time is playing against a diplomatic solution to the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear issue , [PER Sarkozy  ] has led his government and the [ORG EU  ] in confronting [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear ambitions . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] publicly reiterated on January 22 that the " prospect of a nuclear armed [LOC Iran  ] is unacceptable " and pressed for UNSC action to bring [LOC Iran  ] to the negotiating table . 
The [ORG GOF  ] is developing a package of sanctions that target the broad economic interests of the [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Revolutionary Guard Corps  ] and include the areas of finance , insurance , transport , and oil and gas . 
The [MISC French  ] believe [MISC Iranian  ] elections in June changed many people 's opinions about [LOC Iran  ] and they expect the [ORG EU  ] will support enhanced sanctions . 
The [ORG GOF  ] hopes a new [ORG UN Security Council Resolution on Iran  ] can be passed quickly , and it expects [LOC Russia  ] will support such a move . 
However , it is less optimistic about [LOC China  ] . 
For the past two years , the [ORG GOF  ] has pursued rapprochement with [LOC Syria  ] , in part for the purpose of trying to weaken [LOC Damascus  ] 's ties with [LOC Tehran  ] . 
[LOC France  ] has a citizen , [PER Clotilde Reiss  ] , being detained by the [MISC Iranian  ] regime on charges of supporting anti-government protests . 
Last autumn , [PER Sarkozy  ] and [PER Kouchner  ] personalized this issue by publicly condemning the actions of the [MISC Iranian  ] government . 
Since then , reportedly , [PER Sarkozy  ] has personally managed the effort to obtain her release. ----------------------------------------- MIDDLE EAST PEACE: IMPATIENT FOR ACTION ----------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) [PER Sarkozy  ] continues to push [LOC France  ] to play a major role in finding [LOC Middle East  ] peace , but he is impatient and often tries to rush events ahead of [ORG USG  ] plans . 
For over a year , [PER Sarkozy  ] has promoted a high- profile peace conference in [LOC Paris  ] , despite our cautioning that the [MISC Israeli  ] and [MISC Palestinian  ] sides must first show they are ready to negotiate . 
During a January 12 meeting , [PER NSA Levitte  ] told [ORG SE Mitchell  ] that [PER Sarkozy  ] now wants to host a conference in the spring dedicated to strengthening the institutions of a [MISC Palestinian  ] state . 
He added that , in the meantime , if progress is made on the political track , the meeting could be used to help re-launch peace talks . 
The [MISC French  ] agree with us on the need to help President [PER Abbas return  ] to the negotiating table by offering assistance programs , guarantees , and the support of [MISC Arab  ] leaders . 
However [PER Kouchner  ] also mentioned to [ORG SE Mitchell  ] the controversial idea of offering to recognize a [MISC Palestinian  ] state now , with undefined borders , or offering to recognize a [MISC Palestinian  ] state within a defined timeline , regardless of the outcome of negotiations . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] 's personal engagement in supporting the peace process is reflected in his visits to the region and in receiving [MISC Israeli  ] , [MISC Egyptian  ] , [MISC Lebanese  ] , [MISC Syrian  ] , and [MISC Palestinian  ] leaders , most recently [PER Saad Hariri  ] January 21 . 
[LOC France  ] is also interested in serving as a possible intermediary to help re-launch the [MISC Syrian-Israeli  ] peace track. -------------------------- RUSSIA: PUSHING ENGAGEMENT -------------------------- [LOC PARIS  ] 00000079 003 OF 005 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) President [PER Sarkozy  ] is convinced that engagement with [LOC Moscow  ] is the best way to influence [MISC Russian  ] behavior and therefore seeks to create stronger [MISC Russian  ] linkages to western institutions . 
Expect [PER Sarkozy  ] to emphasize the importance of developing a common approach with the [LOC U.S.  ] toward [LOC Russia  ] that builds on the [MISC Washington-Moscow  ] " reset " and reflects [MISC French  ] priorities , including: promoting economic cooperation ; encouraging [LOC Russia  ] to work through institutions with set rules ; publicly supporting [MISC Russian  ] actions while taking a more honest approach in private meetings ; and cultivating relations with [MISC Russian  ] President [PER Dmitri Medvedev  ] , in the hope that he can become a leader independent of [PER Vladimir Putin  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] or [PER Kouchner  ] may well seek to discuss our next steps with [LOC Russia  ] , once the START talks have been completed , and they may push for an early re-launch of CFE negotiations . 
If pressed , [PER Sarkozy  ] will argue that the proposed sale of Mistral-class ships to [LOC Russia  ] offers another opportunity to anchor [LOC Russia  ] to [MISC Western  ] institutions -- just as [MISC French  ] support for an [ORG OSCE  ] summit to discuss [MISC European  ] security is designed to entangle [LOC Russia  ] in a web of commitments that address the human rights and other elements of the [ORG OSCE  ] mandate . 
[LOC France  ] will have multiple opportunities to engage with senior [MISC Russian  ] leaders this year , which the [MISC French  ] and [MISC Russians  ] have dubbed , " The Year of [LOC Russia  ] in [LOC France  ] and the Year of [LOC France  ] in [LOC Russia  ] . 
" [PER Sarkozy  ] will visit [LOC Moscow  ] in February , and [PER Medvedev  ] will visit [LOC France  ] in March . 
Your meeting offers an opportunity to exchange ideas and coordinate our positions in advance of these meetings. --------------------------------- NON-PROLIFERATION AND DISARMAMENT --------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) [LOC France  ] can act -- and has -- as a " force multiplier " for the [LOC United States  ] with more passive [MISC European  ] partners on non-proliferation issues from [LOC Iran  ] to supporting [ORG UN  ] counter-proliferation capacity-building efforts . 
We continue to work closely together on the May [ORG Review Conference  ] for the [ORG Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  ] ( [ORG NPT RevCon  ] ) to engage [MISC Non-Aligned Movement  ] nations who resist stronger non-proliferation measures . 
However , the approach of the [ORG NPT RevCon  ] highlights a policy divergence on nuclear disarmament . 
[LOC France  ] argues that [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to highlight our own disarmament commitment at the [ORG RevCon  ] would open the door for non-aligned nations to make the conference a referendum on actual disarmament progress by the P3 , rather than on proliferation concerns . 
As [LOC France  ] has already made significant disarmament efforts and has a markedly smaller nuclear arsenal than the [LOC United States  ] , [MISC French  ] officials worry that pressure for additional cuts would negatively impact [LOC France  ] 's nuclear deterrent capabilities . 
The [MISC French  ] frequently express their concern that any calls for a " world free of nuclear weapons " serve to delegitimize nuclear weapons , which are a core pillar of [MISC French  ] defense . 
The [MISC French  ] understand the [LOC United States  ] is also committed to maintaining a nuclear deterrent force for as long as necessary , but will look to the release of the [ORG Nuclear Posture Review  ] for hints of how the [LOC U.S.  ] disarmament vision will translate into concrete action . 
Additionally , any efforts at [ORG NATO  ] to push for even a partial rethink on the role of nuclear weapons in alliance strategy would be deeply worrying to the [MISC French.  ] ---------------------------------- [LOC FRANCE  ] A [MISC MAJOR  ] PARTNER IN [LOC AFRICA  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) Under President [PER Sarkozy  ] , [LOC France  ] has remained one of our strongest partners in [LOC Africa  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] has sought to put [MISC Franco-African  ] relations on firmer , institutional grounds in contrast to the personalized leader-to-leader relationships that prevailed following [MISC French  ] decolonization . 
FM [PER Kouchner  ] particularly appreciates his engagement with you on [MISC African  ] issues -- particularly your close collaboration on [LOC Guinea  ] that has borne fruit , with junta leader [LOC PARIS  ] 00000079 004 OF 005 Dadis' decision not to return to [LOC Guinea  ] and the apparent move towards elections . 
Other areas of important cooperation include our countering al [PER Qaida  ] in the [LOC Islamic Maghreb  ] ( [ORG AQIM  ] ) and other terrorist efforts in the [LOC Sahel  ] region , combating piracy off the [LOC Horn of Africa  ] , and seeking stability in [LOC Somalia  ] , where the [MISC French  ] have been active in training [MISC Somali  ] security forces. ---------------------------- COUNTER-TERRORISM/GUANTANAMO ---------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [LOC France  ] engages in a robust intelligence exchange with the [LOC United States  ] on worldwide counter-terrorism issues of interest , including [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Yemen  ] , the [LOC Sahel  ] , and threats to homeland security . 
[LOC France  ] is particularly well-placed to support [LOC U.S.  ] counter-terrorism goals in [LOC Africa  ] , especially the [LOC Sahel  ] region . 
In meetings with S/CT Ambassador [PER Benjamin  ] , [MISC French  ] [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] officials expressed their willingness to work with the [LOC United States  ] on [MISC African  ] counter-terrorism issues and asked that we coordinate our operations in the region to avoid duplication of effort . 
Given their history in the region , the [MISC French  ] would like to be seen as leading the counter-terrorism effort in the [LOC Sahel  ] , rather than simply following us . 
[LOC France  ] accepted four former [ORG Guantanamo  ] detainees with claims to immigration status in [LOC France  ] in July 2004 and an additional three in March 2005 . 
[LOC France  ] was also the first country to accept detainees without any claim to immigration status in the accepting country . 
In May and December 2009 , [LOC France  ] accepted two [MISC Algerian/Bosnian  ] former detainees and resettled them in [LOC France.  ] --------------------------------------------- -- HAITI: U.S.-FRANCE COOPERATION IN RELIEF EFFORT --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Responding immediately to the earthquake on January 12 , [LOC France  ] quickly mobilized physical and financial resources to assist [MISC Haitian  ] disaster victims and has coordinated closely with the [LOC U.S.  ] Total [MISC French  ] official bilateral assistance has risen to about 34 million dollars . 
FM [PER Kouchner  ] has been at the forefront of [MISC French  ] assistance efforts , including participating in the January 25 [LOC Montreal  ] meeting and offering to host a follow-on donors' conference on reconstruction . 
Leading government officials have consistently praised the work of the [PER Obama  ] administration on the ground and defended the need for a strong [LOC U.S.  ] role in the emergency response , correcting short-lived stories of rising diplomatic tension after a junior minister criticized the [LOC U.S.  ] role in [LOC Haiti  ] on January 16 . 
[LOC France  ] seeks to be a partner with us on relief , including assisting orphans. --------------------------------------------- FRANCE-CHINA RELATIONS BACK ON TRACK , FOR NOW --------------------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) After a year-long campaign , [LOC Paris  ] has successfully restored productive working relations with [LOC Beijing  ] following a chill in relations that began with [PER Sarkozy  ] 's December 2008 meeting with the [PER Dalai Lama  ] and the subsequent [MISC Chinese  ] retaliation . 
[LOC France  ] has aggressively promoted its interests in [LOC China  ] ; a series of high-level bilateral exchanges in 2009 included visits to [LOC China  ] by the Prime Minister , the Economy Minister , and the [ORG National Assembly  ] President . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] has agreed to open the [ORG Shanghai Expo  ] in June , and President [PER Hu  ] is expected to pay an official visit this year . 
Despite the investment in restoring [MISC Franco-Chinese  ] ties , [PER Sarkozy  ] has not shied from blaming the [LOC PRC  ] for stalling a climate change agreement in [LOC Copenhagen  ] , has expressed his discontent recently with [LOC China  ] 's exchange-rate policy , and is reportedly dismayed that [LOC China  ] is getting a " free ride " while the [LOC West  ] pays the overhead on international economic and security structures . 
[LOC PARIS  ] 00000079 005 OF 005 -------------------------------------- THE ECONOMIC CRISIS AND EXCHANGE RATES -------------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC French  ] economy has been hit less hard by the crisis than other [ORG EU  ] members or than the [LOC United States  ] , in part because of an extensive social welfare system and the large proportion of government spending in GDP even in normal times . 
In addition , President [PER Sarkozy  ] moved early and vigorously to combat the crisis domestically and internationally . 
[LOC France  ] is deeply engaged in managing the transition from the [ORG G8  ] to the G20 and will chair both groups in 2011 . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] has also been militant on the need for governments to rein in the financial sector . 
President [PER Obama  ] 's latest announcements on bank size and trading activities will be well received by the [ORG GOF.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Sarkozy  ] is personally preoccupied with the weakness of the dollar and exchange rate volatility more broadly . 
The competitiveness of [MISC French  ] big ticket exports -- aircraft , nuclear reactors , highspeed trains -- is particularly hard hit . 
Consistent with his views that the state can often make better decisions than the market , [PER Sarkozy  ] favors a more managed exchange rate system ( as well as a more regulated international oil price ) . 
He has found little support for these ideas outside [LOC France.  ] ------------------------------ CLIMATE CHANGE POST-COPENHAGEN ------------------------------ <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOF  ] supports the [LOC Copenhagen  ] [MISC Accord  ] and is encouraging [MISC African  ] countries to sign on as well . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] said the [ORG Accord  ] " is not a revolution , but it is the start of a revolution " . 
The [ORG GOF  ] has not yet decided on a strategy to move forward but is considering alternative negotiating groups , broader than the [ORG Major Economies Forum  ] ( [ORG MEF  ] ) , but smaller that the full [ORG UN  ] membership . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] likely has his own views on tactics . 
He understands the [ORG USG  ] 's conundrum of synchronizing international commitments with domestic legislative action , but is eager to have firm action by the [LOC United States.  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Madam Secretary , all three [LOC U.S.  ] missions in [LOC Paris  ] are looking forward to your visit and to this opportunity to discuss these important topics with one of our most active [MISC European  ] partners . 
Your visit will help us leverage [MISC French  ] global influence to advance our key policy priorities with [LOC France  ] , around the world .
