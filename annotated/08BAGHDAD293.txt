( C ) Summary: Scion of a prominent [PER Najafi  ] clerical family and related to both Grand [PER Ayatollah Sistani  ] and [PER Moqtada al-Sadr  ] , [PER Emad Klanter  ] told us January 30 that bumbling [MISC Iraqi  ] politicians fail to make progress of any sort but actively encourage a public perception of " [MISC American Occupation  ] " through statements to vernacular media . 
He predicted [PER Sadr  ] would extend his [ORG JAM  ] militia freeze order beyond February , and advised that we can change the " backward " [MISC Sadrists  ] and contain their movement but only if we adopt a more balanced approach to their arch-enemy ISCI . 
[PER Klanter  ] pleaded for [ORG USG  ] pressure on the [MISC GOI  ] and political blocs to hold early provincial elections under an " open list " system , adding that no one but the [MISC Sadrists  ] and [PER Sistani  ] are eager for elections . 
He claimed that his maternal uncle [PER Sistani  ] is alarmed by the degree of [MISC Iranian  ] penetration in [LOC Iraq  ] and is frustrated by his lack of indirect contact with the [ORG USG  ] . 
[PER Klanter  ] warned that only [PER Sistani  ] and the [MISC Marja'iyyah  ] can stand up to [LOC Iran  ] and [MISC Shia  ] extremism , adding that if the [ORG USG  ] does not strengthen [PER Sistani  ] , " [LOC Iran  ] will devour [LOC Iraq  ] .

" Our Brains Are In Our Eyes " ---------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Son of a respected [PER Najafi Ayatollah  ] , nephew to Grand [PER Ayatollah Ali  ] al-Sistani , related by marriage to [PER Muqtada al-Sadr  ] , and bearing a faint resemblance to the actor [PER Robert De Niro  ] , [PER Klanter  ] is a direct descendant of the Prophet [PER Muhammad  ] but was not wearing the traditional [PER Shia Sayyid  ] 's garb of black turban and cloak during our meeting at the IZ villa of [PER Saad Jabr  ] , a [MISC Saddam-era  ] exile opposition financier and son of [LOC Iraq  ] 's first [MISC Shia  ] Prime Minister . 
Claiming he had recently met with Prime Minister [PER Maliki  ] , [PER Klanter  ] bemoaned the ineffectuality of [LOC Iraq  ] 's political leaders and warned that the gap between these leaders and the [MISC Iraqi  ] people is growing wider by the day . 
He stated that while [PER Maliki  ] might be able to entice [ORG Iraqiyyah  ] and [ORG Tawafuq  ] to rejoin his government , neither ISCI nor the [MISC Kurds  ] want anything beyond superficial changes to the status quo . 
When we informed him that [ORG USG  ] patience is wearing thin with the pace of [MISC Iraqi  ] political process , [PER Klanter  ] appeared incredulous that the [LOC U.S.  ] would even consider scaling-down in [LOC Iraq  ] " because you destroyed a regime and now you bear the responsibility to build up a replacement . 
If you leave there is a 100 percent certainty of civil war , which might happen anyway even if you don't leave . 
" Swinging his arms into an abbreviated " Gator [MISC Chomp  ] " type of gesture , he said that if the [LOC U.S  ] , leaves " [LOC Iran  ] will swallow us whole . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Small wonder that the [MISC Iraqi  ] people feel as though they are living under " [MISC American Occupation  ] , " [PER Klanter  ] maintained , because [MISC Iraqi  ] politicians - [PER Shia  ] , [PER Sunni  ] , and [MISC Kurds  ] alike - routinely use terms like " occupation " and " occupiers " when referring to the [ORG USG  ] presence in [LOC Iraq  ] during interviews with local media . 
The forty-something [PER Shia  ] cleric , who told us he teaches religious classes in [LOC Najaf  ] 's traditional [PER Shia  ] seminary ( Hawzah ) and also operates a media-oriented NGO , defied us to name one [MISC Iraqi  ] politician who has ever referred to [MISC Americans  ] as " friends " in local or [MISC Pan-Arab  ] media . 
When [MISC Iraqi  ] politicians talk to [PER Sistani  ] and the [MISC Marja'iyyah  ] , he continued , " they blame you for all of [LOC Iraq  ] 's problems , even their own failure to deliver public services . 
" He chided the [ORG USG  ] for dealing exclusively with [LOC Iraq  ] 's political class and ignoring contact with the [MISC Iraqi  ] people . 
Employing an [MISC Iraqi  ] proverb that says " our brains are in our eyes " , [PER Klanter  ] exclaimed that [MISC Iraqis  ] find it almost impossible to believe news reports that the [ORG USG  ] has spent billions of dollars in [LOC Iraq  ] " since we don't see any buildings or hospitals or structures that you have built here . 
" He chuckled softly when we replied that the important thing is for the [MISC Iraqi  ] people to see the [MISC GOI  ] constructing buildings and other structures for their benefit . 
Sadrist Insights and Elections ------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Klanter  ] , whose two brothers are reportedly married to sisters of [PER Moqtada al-Sadr  ] and who claims to maintain good relations with many senior [MISC Sadrists  ] , said that [PER Sadr  ] will most likely extend the freeze on his [MISC Jaysh  ] al-Mehdi militia beyond its scheduled expiration at the end of February . 
Characterizing the education level and mentality of most [MISC Sadrists  ] as " backward , almost like they are from a cave , " [PER Klanter  ] told us the [ORG USG  ] can contain such people and change their thinking by " sending them to the [LOC U.S.  ] and exposing them to new ideas . 
" In reply to our rejoinder that we seek cordial relations with [MISC Sadrists  ] who wish to participate [LOC BAGHDAD  ] 00000293 002 OF 002 peacefully in [LOC Iraq  ] 's democratic future , [PER Klanter  ] replied that " they hear you say this but then they look at your unbalanced relationship with ISCI and they don't believe your words . 
" [PER Klanter  ] added gratuitously that , in his opinion , ISCI is more dangerous than the [MISC Sadrists  ] because it is fronting for [LOC Iran  ] . 
Conceding that some part of [PER Sadr  ] 's movement is allied with [LOC Iran  ] , he said [PER Moqtada  ] remains popular because " even though he is in [LOC Iran  ] , we hear that he is constantly quarreling with the [MISC Iranians  ] . 
" [PER Jabr  ] chimed in that the [ORG USG  ] has unwittingly driven [PER Sadr  ] into [LOC Tehran  ] 's arms. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Klanter  ] pleaded for [ORG USG  ] pressure on the [MISC GOI  ] and political blocs to hold early provincial elections: such pressure will be needed , he claimed , since no one but the [MISC Sadrists  ] and Grand [PER Ayatollah Sistani  ] are eager for elections . 
Characterizing the 2005 " closed list " electoral system as a failure , [PER Klanter  ] also urged us to push for an " open list " system . 
He said the [MISC Sadrists  ] can live with either an open or closed list system " because they know they have a very loyal base of popular support and they realize they will not be able to attract other voters beyond that base . 
" " Even though I am a man of religion , " [PER Klanter  ] asserted , " I don't support religious political parties because they have been shown to be a complete failure in [LOC Iraq  ] and in [LOC Iran  ] . 
" Frustrated [PER Sistani  ] Wants More Indirect [MISC USG Contact  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Repeating many of the points he made during a January 8 meeting and which he claimed were conveyed to him directly by [PER Sistani  ] ( [PER Ref  ] A ) , [PER Klanter  ] said [PER Sistani  ] 's greatest fear is the degree of [MISC Iranian  ] penetration in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
He claimed that [PER Sistani  ] is in possession of detailed [MISC Iranian  ] plans to dominate [LOC Iraq  ] 's political , economic , and religious institutions . 
[PER Klanter  ] added that [PER Sistani  ] wants to know what the [ORG USG  ] is planning to do about this ( we note that we have heard unsubstantiated reports that [PER Klanter  ] may have ties to [MISC Iranian  ] intelligence and is held at something like arm 's length by his maternal uncle [PER Sistani  ] ) . 
He said [PER Sistani  ] is now more open to indirect contact with the [ORG USG  ] than ever before and is frustrated that previous emissaries were not reliable: we pointed out to [PER Klanter  ] that [PER Fouad Ajami  ] and [PER Ahmad Chalabi  ] , two claimed " emissaries " who [PER Klanter  ] cited by name , are not carrying messages for the [ORG USG  ] . 
He said [PER Sistani  ] 's failure to hear from the [MISC Americans  ] is leading the Grand [PER Ayatollah  ] to think that there might actually be some merit to a circulating [MISC Iraqi  ] public conspiracy theory that the [ORG USG  ] and [LOC Tehran  ] have done a deal over [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[PER Klanter  ] ended the meeting by warning that only [PER Sistani  ] and the [MISC Marja'iyyah  ] can stand up to [LOC Iran  ] and [MISC Shia  ] extremism , adding that if the [ORG USG  ] does not support [PER Sistani  ] , " [LOC Iran  ] will devour [LOC Iraq  ] .
