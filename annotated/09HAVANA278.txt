( [ORG SBU  ] ) A team made up of prosecutors from the [ORG US Attorney 's Office  ] from the [ORG Southern District of Florida  ] , public defenders assigned to the defendants in two criminal alien smuggling cases , a court reporter , videographer , two interpreters and two [MISC DHS/ICE  ] agents traveled to [LOC Cuba  ] May 6 to take court-ordered depositions from 10 [MISC Cuban  ] citizens connected to the two smuggling cases. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG GOC  ] granted formal approval for the travel of the group , provided the team members with visas , and offered one of the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] 's ( MININT ) " protocol houses " in the suburb of Siboney to hold the depositions . 
The [ORG GOC  ] also undertook to find the 10 witnesses desired by the court . 
In the end , the [ORG GOC  ] reported that two of the witnesses had once again departed for the [LOC U.S.  ] and had apparently succeeded in their renewed attempt . 
Another was preparing for an interview with the [ORG Refugee Unit of the Interests Section  ] , and declined to testify out of fear he would put his refugee status at risk . 
The remaining seven witnesses were brought to the protocol house in the order requested by the team . 
Space was provided in a separate area of the house for defense counsels to speak with the witnesses before they began their testimony . 
[ORG GOC  ] officials told the team there would be no problem in their taking and recording testimony from the witnesses for as long as needed , and that the court reporter would be permitted to swear in the witnesses . 
MININT provided food and refreshments to the team , which dedicated two complete days ( May 7-8 ) to taking the depositions . 
When they had completed their work , members of the team expressed satisfaction with the deposition-taking process. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) COMMENT: This is the first time in the memory of anyone presently at [PER USINT  ] that such a complete process of deposing witnesses has been carried out . 
The last time [ORG USG  ] officials came to [LOC Cuba  ] to take depositions was in 2007 when FBI personnel took depositions from [MISC Cuban  ] citizens regarding the [MISC Posada-Carriles  ] case . 
Both MININT and MINREX personnel who were present throughout the depositions were cordial and helpful to the team members and to [PER USINT  ] personnel who accompanied them . 
During the process , the [ORG GOC  ] officials observed some fairly intense cross-examination of the witnesses by the attorneys on both sides . 
This provoked some conversation about the technical issues of the [LOC US  ] judicial system between the MININT officers and , [PER USINT  ] and [LOC AUSA  ] personnel. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) COMMENT CONTINUED: We are not sure why the [ORG GOC  ] decided to be as cooperative as it was with this case . 
The [ORG GOC  ] officers present certainly picked up some information about smuggling operations , and about how the [ORG USG  ] prosecutes smugglers that may be useful to them in the future . 
Whether this case signals a willingness to cooperate more with us on law enforcement issues , or establishes an upper limit on such cooperation remains to be seem , however .
