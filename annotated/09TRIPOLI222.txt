[LOC LIBYA  ] EARMARKS 16 BILLION DOLLARS TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On March 10 , Secretary of the [ORG General People 's Committee  ] al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi ( PM-equivalent ) officially opened the first " business incubator " in [LOC Tripoli  ] to assist small- and medium-sized businesses ( [ORG SME  ] 's ) . 
Also present at the opening were Secretary [PER Matuq Matuq  ] ( head of the [ORG General People 's Committee for Facilities  ] , an agency created in last week 's cabinet shuffle reported in Ref B ) , the director of the [ORG National Economic Development Board  ] ( [ORG EDB  ] ) , [PER Mahmoud Jibril  ] , as well as members of the diplomatic corps . 
As part of the [MISC Libyan  ] government 's efforts to reform and diversify the economy away from hydrocarbons , al-Mahmoudi 's [ORG EDB  ] has spear-headed the creation of " business incubators " with the hope of reducing unemployment ( estimated at 20 percent ) and creating opportunities for [LOC Libya  ] 's unemployed youth . 
Participants in the Business Incubator program will receive training , such as in preparing business plans , conducting feasibility studies , and access to credit . 
The incubators will also provide information and communication technology , office space , workshops , business and financial management training , and help entering new markets . 
( [ORG Note:  ] The Embassy is currently working with the [ORG EDB  ] to provide technical assistance to the Business Incubator program managers by partnering with the [ORG U.S. Department of Commerce  ] 's [ORG Commercial Law Development Program  ] . 
See Ref A. End note ) . 
In his remarks at the opening ceremony , al-Mahmoudi said the Government of [LOC Libya  ] ( [ORG GOL  ] ) had earmarked 20 billion [MISC Libyan  ] dinars ( about 16 billion USD ) for the promotion of small- and medium-sized businesses and for a " [MISC Financial Fund  ] " as part of the program . 
In a follow-up conversation with [ORG EDB  ] staff , Econoff asked for more details on the " [MISC Fund  ] " but staff said the modalities of how small loans would be disbursed were not yet known . 
In all , five incubators are planned to be opened nation-wide with some focusing on agriculture and some on industry . 
They will target new graduates , the unemployed ( especially youth ) , and women . 
WORKING IN COOPERATION WITH THE EU , [LOC TUNISIA  ] , [LOC EGYPT  ] , AND [LOC JORDAN  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) At the opening ceremony in [LOC Tripoli  ] , al-Mahmoudi said that [LOC Libya  ] was working in cooperation with the [ORG European Union  ] , and bilaterally with [LOC Italy  ] , to promote small business development . 
He noted the recently-ratified [MISC Libyan-Italian  ] partnership agreement " required " [LOC Italy  ] to open its markets for [MISC Libyan  ] goods that would be produced by the new entrepreneurs from the business incubators . 
He said [LOC Libya  ] hoped to exchange experiences in promoting small businesses with neighbors such as [LOC Tunisia  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC Jordan  ] . 
The [MISC Jordanian  ] organization , [MISC Jordanian  ] [LOC Expertise House  ] ( [ORG JEH  ] ) , is assisting the [ORG Tripoli Business Incubator  ] in its early stages . 
No mention was made of plans for [MISC American  ] technical assistance via the [ORG Commercial Law Development Plan  ] but this could be because joint-activities are not slated to begin until this coming June . 
Dr. [PER Mahmoud Jibril  ] of the [ORG EDB  ] also made remarks at the ceremony , in which he said the opening of [ORG Tripoli Business Incubator  ] represented an important step in preparing youth to run their start-up businesses successfully . 
He noted the incubators were especially important in oil-producing countries , like [LOC Libya  ] , where the culture of self-employment and private initiative was almost non-existent . 
A change in the " work culture " of [MISC Libyan  ] youth would be a great accomplishment of the program , in his view . 
BUT IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME [LOC LIBYA  ] HAS TRIED THIS <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) At the reception following the ceremony , the [MISC German  ] DCM asked whether the incubators would connect [MISC Libyan  ] entrepreneurs to foreign companies , noting that many small- and medium-sized [MISC German  ] firms were looking for [MISC Libyan  ] partners . 
A member of the [ORG EDB  ] staff said this had not figured into the initial plans but that eventually the incubators could serve as a clearinghouse [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000222 002.2 OF 002 for matching [MISC Libyan  ] and foreign [ORG SME  ] 's . 
The [ORG French Economic Counselor  ] told Econoff that this program was at least the third attempt to assist SMEs in [LOC Libya  ] and his predecessor had tried to link the [ORG EDB  ] to [MISC French  ] organizations that help SMEs by sending Dr. [PER Jibril  ] to [LOC France  ] on a study tour . 
He said this had not been fruitful due to the lack of institutional structures and bureaucratic capacity to help [ORG SME  ] 's in [LOC Libya  ] . 
POST-CABINET SHUFFLE: AL-MAHMOUDI TRYING TO SHOW RESULTS ? <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Comment: Will the business incubator program succeed ? 
This is not yet clear but it won't be for lack of funding . 
The reported budget of 20 billion dinars ( 16 billion USD ) is huge but it is unclear as to how it will be allocated and whether some portions will be loans or loan guarantees . 
Another unknown is how micro-loans would be disbursed given that the [MISC Libyan  ] economy is largely cash-based and banks are not widely-used , except for disbursing payrolls . 
Whether or not the loans would be paid back is another question mark , particularly in a country where loans from state-run banks have traditionally been given based on patronage and where there is no nation-wide credit bureau . 
The roll-out of the incubator program also coincides with the [ORG General People 's Congress'  ] decision to postpone al-Qadhafi 's much-touted wealth distribution program . 
The announcement of the incubator program could be an effort to demonstrate that the government will help [MISC Libyans  ] in other ways than distributing the country 's oil revenues directly to the people . 
The undertone to the talk of helping unemployed youth is that the regime is under pressure to provide meaningful options for young people lest they turn to extremism and terrorism . 
Setting up business incubators elsewhere in [LOC Libya  ] , particularly around [LOC Benghazi  ] , will be especially important there since rates of unemployment are even higher than the nation-wide average of 20 percent , a potential driver of extremism in a region that has historically provided foreign fighters to [ORG al-Qaeda  ] in [LOC Iraq  ] .
