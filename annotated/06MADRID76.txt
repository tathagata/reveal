( C ) Summary . 
The Ambassador met with Foreign Minister [PER Miguel Angel Moratinos  ] on January 12 to advise him of the [ORG USG  ] decision to deny the [MISC Spanish  ] technology transfer license request related to the sale of [MISC Spanish  ] aircraft to the [MISC Venezuelan  ] government . 
[PER Moratinos  ] expressed frustration , saying it would be seen as a " punitive action " by the [ORG USG  ] against [LOC Spain  ] and would provide a field day for the opposition and the media . 
He said he expected a negative reaction by President [PER Zapatero  ] to the news . 
[PER Moratinos  ] complained that the [ORG USG  ] did not recognize [LOC Spain  ] 's positive steps , but only focused on negative episodes in the relationship ; he urged a clear " positive signal " that the [ORG USG  ] wanted good relations with [LOC Spain  ] . 
The Ambassador reviewed the [ORG USG  ] 's clear , consistent , and frequent messages to [LOC Spain  ] regarding its sale of ships and planes to [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
He said the [ORG USG  ] also desired better relations and had made a concerted effort to work with [LOC Spain  ] in [LOC Latin America  ] , as evidenced by the upcoming visit of [ORG WHA A/S Shannon  ] . 
The Ambassador met briefly with President [PER Zapatero  ] and [PER Moratinos  ] at a representational event later in the day ; both appeared to have accepted the news and were focused on how to deal with it in the media . 
Comment: It would be useful from [LOC Embassy Madrid  ] 's perspective to again demonstrate our interest in good relations with [LOC Spain  ] , perhaps by arranging a meeting for [PER Moratinos  ] with the Secretary when [PER Moratinos  ] is in the [LOC U.S.  ] in May for the [ORG U.S.-Spain Council  ] meeting in [LOC Florida  ] . 
End Comment. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Separately , [PER Moratinos  ] discussed his impressions of [MISC Bolivian  ] president-elect [PER Evo Morales  ] , describing him as honest , but inexperienced and caught in " a bear hug " by [PER Castro  ] and [PER Chavez  ] . 
He said he had encouraged [PER Morales  ] to work with the [ORG USG  ] . 
For his part [PER Morales  ] asked that [LOC Spain  ] convey two messages to the [MISC USG: A  ] ) that the [ORG USG  ] not imply that he is connected to narcotraffickers ( or by association with terrorists ) because of his support for the coca growers , and B ) that the [ORG USG  ] give [PER Morales  ] " room for maneuver " with the [ORG IMF  ] and [ORG World Bank  ] . 
End Summary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The Ambassador , accompanied by DCM , relayed reftel points to FM [PER Moratinos  ] and Deputy FM [PER Bernardino Leon  ] , telling [PER Moratinos  ] that it was not the [ORG USG  ] 's intent to make the denial of the licenses public . 
The Ambassador explained that the [ORG USG  ] had carefully reviewed the application for a license by [ORG EADS  ] CASA and was denying the application consistent with [ORG USG  ] concerns regarding the transfer of such technology to [LOC Venezuela  ] , not as a swipe against the [MISC Spanish  ] government . 
He told [PER Moratinos  ] that he would similarly inform Minister of Defense [PER Jose Bono  ] and [ORG EADS  ] CASA Chairman Sanz. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Moratinos  ] asked whether the [ORG USG  ] decision could be reversed . 
The Ambassador said that it was a firm decision that could only be revisited if [LOC Venezuela  ] changed its present course , noting that the [ORG USG  ] was following the same policy with respect to similar applications by other countries for authorization to transfer technology to [LOC Venezuela  ] , as we had recently explained to [MISC Spanish  ] officials . 
[PER Moratinos  ] said the denial of the applications was unfortunate , given the [MISC Spanish  ] government 's approval to [ORG EADS  ] CASA to continue with the sale and expressed concern about how this decision would affect [MISC Spanish  ] commercial interests . 
The Ambassador ventured that [ORG EADS  ] CASA would probably not be unduly harmed , given the company 's significant business interests elsewhere , but that that issue was for the company to resolve. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Moratinos  ] turned to the political impact of the [ORG USG  ] decision , saying it would be portrayed as a punitive action by the [ORG USG  ] against the [ORG Zapatero  ] government and would give the opposition and the media platform to cast [PER Zapatero  ] as inept in his handling of relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Moratinos  ] said he would inform [ORG Zapatero  ] immediately and expected him to react negatively to the news . 
He said he would inform the Ambassador of [PER Zapatero  ] 's reaction. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In a frustrated tone , [PER Moratinos  ] asked what the [ORG USG  ] expected of [LOC Spain  ] . 
He said 2006 was a crucial year for the [ORG Zapatero  ] government and that they had to get bilateral relations on track because the [LOC U.S.  ] would be absorbed by political campaigning in 2007 . 
[PER Moratinos  ] said [LOC Spain  ] desired " clear signals " from the [ORG USG  ] that bilateral relations had improved , but saw only " punitive signals , " including this decision to deny the technology transfer to [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
He said the [ORG USG  ] and [LOC Spain  ] should be establishing joint objectives in democracy promotion in [LOC Venezuela  ] rather than arguing over arms sales . 
" We are the eighth largest power in the world , but ( the [ORG USG  ] ) treats us like a fifth-rate power . 
We have no indication that there could be a visit by Secretary Rice or other high level attention . 
We want to SIPDIS work with you , but need a minimal political signal that you want to work with us . 
We need to demonstrate that the bilateral relations are on track and are not just about what we are doing in [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The Ambassador responded that there could be no surprise on the part of [PER Moratinos  ] or other [MISC Spanish  ] leaders regarding the [ORG USG  ] 's decision on the [ORG EADS  ] CASA application . 
From the beginning , the [ORG USG  ] message on the [MISC Spanish  ] sales to [LOC Venezuela  ] had been clear , consistent , and frequent . 
[LOC Spain  ] had made its decision in spite of our objections . 
Nevertheless , said the Ambassador , the [ORG USG  ] also wished to put this issue behind us and move forward on a common agenda , as evidenced by the upcoming visits of [ORG WHA A/S Tom Shannon  ] and Senator [PER Mel Martinez  ] . 
He also noted [MISC Spanish  ] Vice President de [PER la Vega  ] 's expression of interest in visiting the [LOC U.S.  ] , which the [MISC Embassy  ] supported . 
The Ambassador said he agreed with [PER Moratinos  ] that we could work together to make 2006 a good year for the bilateral relationship . 
At this point , Deputy FM [PER Leon  ] noted that former President [PER Felipe Gonzalez  ] planned to visit [LOC Venezuela  ] at the end of January to talk to both [PER Chavez  ] and the opposition as part of [LOC Spain  ] 's democracy promotion efforts. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Hours later , the Ambassador met with President [PER Zapatero  ] and [PER Moratinos  ] in an informal pull-aside at a [LOC Royal Palace  ] reception . 
They seemed to have digested the news well and were focused on media portrayal of the decision . 
The Ambassador assured them that the [ORG USG  ] was not interested in a negative portrayal of this episode in the media viz-a-viz [ORG U.S.-Spain  ] bilateral relations. //EVO [PER MORALES  ] VISIT// <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) On the visit of [MISC Bolivian  ] president-elect [PER Evo Morales  ] , [PER Moratinos  ] shared his impression that [LOC Morales'  ] strengths were his " honesty and his conscience . 
" However , [PER Moratinos  ] also described [PER Morales  ] as uninformed and inexperienced . 
[PER Morales  ] told [MISC Spanish  ] interlocutors that he desired a special relationship with [LOC Spain  ] and did not want to rely solely on [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] , but [PER Moratinos  ] expressed concern that [PER Castro  ] and [PER Chavez'  ] " bear hug " of [PER Morales  ] would continue to have a negative effect . 
[PER Moratinos  ] said he had urged [PER Morales  ] to stop aggravating the [ORG USG  ] . 
According to [PER Moratinos  ] , [PER Morales  ] asked that [LOC Spain  ] convey two messages to the [ORG USG  ] on his behalf: -- Do not implicate him with narcotics trafficking ( or by extension narco terrorism ) simply because of his support for coca cultivation ; and , -- Give him room for manuever with the [ORG IMF  ] and the [ORG World Bank.  ] //COMMENT// <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Given President [PER Zapatero  ] 's measured response , it appears that [PER Moratinos  ] overcame his frustration and presented the issue to [PER Zapatero  ] is a straightforward manner . 
Overall , [PER Moratinos  ] has been a positive influence throughout this episode , despite having to ( again ) play the role of the loser in an internal struggle with [PER Bono  ] . 
[PER Moratinos  ] consistently scores near the bottom in [MISC Spanish  ] public opinion polls while [PER Bono  ] is among the most popular figures in the cabinet . 
This may be due in part to the fact that [PER Bono  ] is a professional politician , while [PER Moratinos  ] is a career diplomat with little flair for the spotlight . 
From our viewpoint , it makes sense to reinforce [MISC Moratinos'  ] positive attitudes , perhaps through a meeting with the Secretary during [MISC Moratinos'  ] visit to the [LOC U.S.  ] in May to participate in the [ORG U.S.-Spain Council  ] meetings in [LOC Florida  ] .
