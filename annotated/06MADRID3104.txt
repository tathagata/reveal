[LOC MADRID  ] 01799 [LOC MADRID  ] 00003104 001.2 OF 002 Classified By: DCM [PER Hugo Llorens  ] ; reason 1.4 ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [MISC Mallorcan  ] " [ORG Free Association of Attorneys  ] " and a group of [MISC Mallorcan  ] professionals filed a motion calling upon [ORG National Court  ] Judge [PER Ismael Moreno  ] to name 13 presumed USG officials as suspects in connection with the transit of a [ORG CIA  ] flight that stopped in [LOC Palma de Mallorca  ] in January 2004 . 
The attorney 's association and the [MISC Mallorcan  ] professionals are the plaintiffs in a suit alleging torture , kidnapping , and illegal detention on the part of the [ORG CIA  ] ( [ORG Refs  ] A , B , and C ) . 
( NOTE: Under [MISC Spanish  ] law , an association of individuals can file charges against a defendant in a criminal case even if they were not directly affected by the actions of the defendant . 
For example , the " [ORG Association of Victims of Terrorism  ] " has routinely used this mechanism to press charges against figures connected to [ORG ETA  ] terrorist acts . 
END NOTE ) . <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The plaintiffs drew the names from a report prepared by [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG Civil Guard  ] in 2005 regarding the occupants of a [ORG Boeing  ] 737 with tail number [ORG N313P  ] . 
The [ORG Civil Guard  ] investigation was requested by the local court in [LOC Mallorca  ] where the plaintiffs originally filed their case . 
The plaintiffs claim that this particular aircraft participated in the extraordinary rendition of [MISC German  ] national Khaled el [PER Masri  ] in [LOC Macedonia  ] after departing from [MISC Spanish  ] territory . 
The names of the alleged occupants include: - [PER James Fairing  ] - [PER Jason Franklin  ] - [PER Michael Grady  ] - [PER Lyle Edgard Lumsden III  ] - [PER Eric Fair  ] - [PER Bryam Charles  ] - [PER Kirk James Bird  ] - [PER Walter Richard Gressbore  ] - [PER Patricia Rilroy  ] - [PER Jane Payne  ] - [PER James O'Hale  ] - [PER John Decker  ] - [PER Hector Lorenzo  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Press reports indicate that at least five of the persons named in the suit held [LOC U.S.  ] diplomatic passports . 
In order for the plaintiff 's demand to proceed , it must be supported by [ORG National Court  ] Prosecutor [PER Vicente Gonzalez Mota  ] and approved by Judge [PER Moreno  ] . 
[PER Gonzalez  ] has not yet indicated whether he will support the plaintiff 's request . 
He and Judge [PER Moreno  ] previously denied plaintiff 's demands that the [ORG National Court  ] request a report on the [ORG CIA  ] flights from the [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy in [LOC Madrid  ] or other USG authorities . 
However , Judge [PER Moreno  ] has already entered into evidence the October 9 testimony of Khaled el [PER Masri  ] as well as telephone logs from the [ORG Gran Melia Victoria  ] hotel and the [ORG Marriot Son Antem  ] in [LOC Palma de Mallorca  ] where the crew of the aircraft in question stayed during their stopovers in [LOC Mallorca  ] . 
( NOTE: el [PER Masri  ] testified before the [ORG National Court  ] that he was kidnapped and tortured by the [ORG CIA  ] for five months in 2004 , but acknowledged that could not identify the individuals who transported him from [LOC Macedonia  ] to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , nor could he demonstrate that the aircraft that transported him was the same the same aircraft identified in the [LOC Mallorca  ] suit . 
END NOTE ) . 
The [ORG National Court  ] has also requested the testimony of prosecutors from [LOC Milan  ] and [LOC Munich  ] regarding the kidnapping of el [PER Masri  ] in [LOC Macedonia  ] and [MISC Egyptian  ] national [PER Abu Omar  ] in [LOC Italy.  ] //COMMENT// <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) It is possible that this case could eventually result in an official request to the USG by the [ORG National Court  ] for information related to this aircraft and the personnel on the aircraft . 
While the [MISC Spanish  ] Government has maintained that no crimes were committed in [MISC Spanish  ] territory , the [MISC Spanish  ] courts , including Judge [PER Moreno  ] , have asserted universal jurisdiction in cases involving torture , including in third countries . 
The [ORG National Court Prosecutor  ] in this case , [PER Vicente Gonzalez  ] , is well known to us as [LOC Spain  ] 's liaison to the Embassy for the work of the [ORG Bilateral Counter Terrorism Experts Working Group  ] . 
We find him to be an engaging and helpful colleague and anticipate that he will be sensitive to the [MISC Spanish  ] Government 's preference that this case not proceed . 
However , we have already seen in similar cases that [MISC Spanish  ] judges fiercely guard their independence and are willing to break new ground on issues of jurisdiction . 
If Judge [PER Moreno  ] were to determine that there was sufficient [PER MADRID  ] 00003104 002.2 OF 002 evidence that a crime had been committed and that perpetrators could be identified , he would forward the case to a panel of trial judges . 
We will continue to track and report on developments in this case .
