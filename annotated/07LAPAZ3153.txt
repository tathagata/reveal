( C ) Summary . 
A common cry among opposition circles is that [PER Hugo Chavez  ] is pulling [PER Evo  ] 's strings , particularly as [PER Morales  ] forcefully pushes forward to adopt a new constitution that would provide for indefinite reelection . 
[PER Evo  ] for his part does nothing to hide his admiration for [PER Chavez  ] ; on the contrary he acts like a smitten school girl when he is with [PER Chavez  ] and constantly touts their personal/ideological bond . 
But , how much influence does [PER Chavez  ] have ? 
Is [MISC Venezuelan  ] money buying loyalty within the [MISC Bolivian  ] armed forces ? 
Are there sizable numbers of [MISC Venezuelan  ] troops in country ? 
Is [LOC Venezuela  ] smuggling arms into [LOC Bolivia  ] ? 
While it is difficult to separate fact from fiction , there is little doubt here that [PER Evo  ] listens to [PER Chavez  ] , and that the [MISC Venezuelan  ] and [MISC Cuban  ] Ambassadors here play a central advisory role . 
We have heard enough to indicate that [LOC Venezuela  ] is impatient with the pace of change in [LOC Bolivia  ] and is pushing [PER Morales  ] hard to consolidate his hold on power . 
The results of [MISC Venezuelan  ] December 2 constitutional referendum may impact [PER Evo  ] 's thinking on how he should proceed with a similar referendum in [LOC Bolivia  ] .

( C ) While the opposition sometimes exaggerates [MISC Chavez'  ] influence over [PER Morales  ] , [MISC Brazilian  ] and [MISC Peruvian  ] diplomats based in [LOC La Paz  ] assert that it is becoming increasingly evident that [PER Chavez  ] is pushing [PER Evo  ] to follow [LOC Venezuela  ] 's script . 
These diplomats recounted a [ORG GRULAC  ] dinner hosted by the [MISC Cuban  ] [ORG Ambassador  ] on November 26 , attended by President [PER Morales  ] ( who arrived with the [MISC Venezuelan  ] [ORG Ambassador  ] ) , during which [PER Evo  ] told the group that " there is no going back . 
" [PER Morales  ] expressed displeasure with how his [ORG MAS  ] party handled the [ORG Constituent Assembly  ] process in [LOC Sucre  ] but was vehement that a new constitution must go forward . 
To the astonishment of the [MISC Latin American  ] diplomats present , the [MISC Venezuelan  ] [ORG Ambassador  ] then launched into a 30-minute ramble about the common history [LOC Bolivia  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] share and how their futures are linked. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) According to the [MISC Brazilian  ] political counselor , an " extremely reliable " source had reported that the [MISC Venezuelan  ] [ORG Ambassador  ] was at an [PER Evo  ] cabinet meeting November 29 as the [ORG MAS-led Constituent Assembly  ] was proceeding in [LOC Sucre  ] . 
Apparently , when a couple of ministers expressed concern about moving forward unilaterally with the [ORG Constituent Assembly  ] , the [MISC Venezuelan  ] [ORG Ambassador  ] urged that the government go ahead . 
Comment: While we are quite skeptical that the [MISC Venezuelan  ] [ORG Ambassador  ] would actually attend a cabinet meeting , [ORG ROAL  ] sources independently place the [MISC Venezuelan  ] at the Palace that day . 
Whether or not the [MISC Venezuelan  ] [ORG Ambassador  ] actually attended the cabinet meeting , [PER Evo  ] meets regularly with him and undoubtedly seeks his advice .

) [MISC Venezuelan  ] Military Presence in [ORG Beni Department  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In a discussion with [MISC Peruvian  ] , [MISC German  ] , [MISC Argentine  ] and [MISC Brazilian  ] diplomats here , all expressed concern about a known [MISC Venezuelan  ] military presence in the northeastern [ORG Beni department  ] ( bordering [LOC Brazil  ] ) . 
It is quite public and in fact touted that a [MISC Venezuelan  ] engineer company is building levies around the [ORG Beni  ] capital of [LOC Trinidad  ] . 
[ORG Beni  ] local authorities are , however , convinced that the [MISC Venezuelans  ] are also training [MISC Bolivian  ] military in special operations and have sizable arms caches for a possible further deployment . 
The [MISC German  ] reported that without a doubt there is a [MISC Venezuelan  ] base in [LOC San Borja  ] , but the other diplomats were dismissive of this information and argued that the [ORG Beni  ] authorities tend to greatly exaggerate . 
We cannot confirm that there is a " secret " [MISC Venezuelan  ] base at that location and suspect that the opposition is exaggerating and/or is simply expressing concern about the [MISC Venezuelan  ] military presence . 
Our Defense Attach was told by the Mayor of [LOC Trinidad  ] on November 26 that there are 200 to 300 [MISC Venezuelans  ] in [LOC Trinidad  ] . 
The group of diplomats affirmed that the number of [MISC Venezuelans  ] is about 300 , but no one is completely certain . 
We understand that the [MISC Venezuelans  ] have exclusive control over [MISC Venezuelan  ] flights and cargo , and exercise an inordinate amount of control over the military portion of the [LOC Trinidad  ] airport .

( S ) Defense Attach also met with [LOC Trinidad  ] Mayor [PER Moises Shiriqui  ] following a meeting between [ORG Beni Department  ] Prefect [PER Ernesto Suarez  ] and [LOC Beni Mayors  ] . 
The Mayor brought up the 0100 arrival of a [LOC Venezuela  ] [MISC C-130  ] cargo plane at the [ORG Beni  ] airport November 24 , which local authorities suspected was shuttling arms . 
After unloading seven large wooden crates , the plane immediately departed . 
Authorities told the media , which were forced to leave shortly after the landing , that the boxes contained medical supplies . 
( Note: We have not been able to determine what is in the crates . 
End note . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Prefect [PER Suarez  ] announced publicly November 29 that [MISC Venezuelan  ] planes would not be allowed to land at [LOC Trinidad  ] . 
If provided advance landing notice from the government , local authorities plan to block the runway with vehicles in order to prevent any [MISC Venezuelan  ] plane from landing or taking off . 
( Note: Official Airport hours are between 0800 and 2200 . 
There is a history of opposition accusations the [MISC Venezuelans  ] are shipping in arms , perhaps destined for nefarious pro-government groups . 
The opposition also complained about an early morning [ORG Beni  ] stopover by [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Hugo Chavez  ] as an affront to [MISC Bolivian  ] sovereignty .

) Will [MISC Evo Turn  ] To [PER Comandante Chavez  ] ? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [MISC Peruvian  ] political counselor was extremely concerned that [LOC Venezuela  ] , at [PER Evo  ] 's invitation , would intervene militarily in [LOC Bolivia  ] to back [PER Morales  ] should he be unable to exercise control over the opposition departments of [ORG Beni  ] , [PER Pando  ] , [ORG Tarija  ] and [LOC Santa Cruz  ] . 
The [MISC Peruvian  ] believes , and the [MISC Brazilian  ] agreed , that the rank-and-file military will not/not use lethal force against fellow [MISC Bolivians  ] . 
We too share this assessment ( Ref B ) . 
The [MISC Peruvian  ] and [MISC Brazilian  ] both commented that funds coming in from [LOC Venezuela  ] to the [MISC Bolivian  ] military do not flow down from the senior ranks , and therefore , there is much resentment . 
The top military commanders , however , are opportunists that will follow [PER Evo  ] 's orders out of self-interest . 
In fact , Generals [PER Vargas  ] , [PER Bersatti  ] and [PER Trigo  ] are reportedly fighting to stay in their jobs , causing further disgruntlement among those who would like to move into their positions . 
So , there are strong indications that the military is split and could be quite reticent to follow orders . 
Hence , with no [MISC Bolivian  ] military to enforce [PER Evo  ] 's will , [LOC Peru  ] fears he will turn to [PER Chavez  ] .

( SBU ) [PER Chavez  ] 's November 27 statement that the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" empire " is " promoting violence " in order to overthrow the [PER Morales  ] administration builds on a constant barrage of inflammatory statements indicating a willingness , or perhaps an eagerness , to send [MISC Venezuelan  ] troops to [LOC Bolivia  ] to bolster his erstwhile ally . 
[PER Chavez  ] 's October 14 threat to turn [LOC Bolivia  ] into [LOC Vietnam  ] should " oligarchs " attack [PER Morales  ] provided the opposition with traction for long-standing complaints of [MISC Venezuelan  ] " imperialist " designs . 
[PER Morales  ] defended the remarks in November 4 magazine article . 
Both leaders reiterated and expanded upon the [LOC Vietnam  ] remarks during their November 10 addresses at the [ORG Ibero-American Conference  ] in [LOC Chile  ] , where [PER Chavez  ] warned [MISC Bolivian  ] supporters of the [LOC United States  ] ( " pitiyanquies " ) that any attempt to remove [PER Morales  ] would be met with " a thunder of rifles and machine guns . 
" Questions over possible [MISC Venezuelan  ] involvement in the October 18 [MISC Bolivian  ] military takeover of [PER Santa Cruz  ] 's [ORG Viru Viru Airport  ] further ignited criticism of the [MISC Bolivian-Venezuelan  ] relationship . 
[MISC Venezuelan  ] " imperialism " has stayed in the headlines since , fed by heated exchanges between opposition and government officials , an alleged attack on the [MISC Venezuelan  ] consulate in [PER Santa Cruz  ] , and a scandal involving $11 million in missing [MISC Venezuelan  ] micro-credit loans .

( C ) The opposition 's cries of [PER Chavez  ] the big bad wolf are over the top , but they are right when they express concern that [PER Evo  ] is getting advice from the [MISC Venezuelans  ] and [MISC Cubans  ] . 
With checks and doctors , the [MISC Venezuelan  ] and [MISC Cuban  ] ambassadors are doing what they can to bolster [PER Evo  ] and push his change program . 
For example , it is estimated that [PER Evo  ] has distributed around $60-80 million in [MISC Venezuelan  ] checks to municipalities since he came to office . 
That said , beyond the financial support and advisory role , we find little hard evidence to support the prospect of actual [MISC Venezuelan  ] military intervention in [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
The opposition will continue to point to [PER Chavez  ] to discredit [PER Evo  ] and are hoping that a victory for the " no " vote in [LOC Venezuela  ] 's referendum will give [PER Evo  ] pause about proceeding with his . 
Likewise , the opposition fears that if [PER Chavez  ] wins , he will embolden [PER Evo  ] to push ahead [ORG GOLDBERG</pre></code>  ]
