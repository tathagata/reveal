SAN SALVADOR 789 Classified By: Charge d'Affaires , for reasons 1.4 ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Embassy [LOC San Salvador  ] provides the following responses to Reftel queries. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) DOES MINISTER OF DEFENSE PAYES HAVE CLOSE RELATIONS WITH [MISC FMLN  ] HARDLINERS ? 
IF SO , WITH WHOM ? 
[PER No. Munguia Payes  ] , both during the campaign and since becoming Minister of Defense , has been quick to point out to Embassy interlocutors that he fought against the guerrilla forces that later formed the [MISC FMLN  ] during his time in the [ORG Salvadoran Armed Forces  ] . 
Indeed , [PER Munguia Payes  ] seems to see himself as the sole cabinet-level official in a security position without divided loyalties between [PER Funes  ] and the [MISC FMLN  ] . 
However , he has a cordial/correct relationship with the [MISC FMLN  ] hardliners in the [LOC GOES.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) WHAT IS VICE PRESIDENT SALVADOR SANCHEZ CEREN'S CURRENT RELATIONSHIP WITH [MISC FMLN  ] HARDLINERS ? 
We have no evidence to suggest that longstanding ties between [PER Sanchez Ceren  ] and [MISC FMLN  ] Coordinator General ( and head of legislative bloc ) [PER Medardo Gonzalez  ] , [PER Jose Luis Merino  ] , [PER Sigfrido Reyes  ] , and other hard-line elements of the [MISC FMLN  ] have changed . 
However , the heavy schedule [PER Sanchez Ceren  ] keeps as Minister of Education and Vice President , along with persistent rumors of health problems , suggest he has less time to devote to party business than when he was head of the [MISC FMLN  ] 's bloc in the [ORG Legislative Assembly  ] . 
It is very troubling that on September 26 [PER Sanchez Ceren  ] made anti-American statements at an [MISC FMLN  ] rally in support of [PER Manuel Zelaya  ] . 
The [LOC GOES  ] is wrestling with [PER Sanchez Ceren  ] 's inconsistency when wearing his VP hat as opposed to his [MISC FMLN  ] hat . 
HOW DOES HE GET ALONG WITH [ORG FUNES  ] ? 
[PER Sanchez Ceren  ] 's relationship with [PER Funes  ] grew from nearly non-existent to a working relationship during the campaign . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] recently told [MISC PolCouns  ] that [ORG Funes  ] and [PER Sanchez Ceren  ] did not talk " as much as I would like " but that when they did talk , it was productive and that the two seemed to get along well together . 
The two almost never appear together in public . 
Also , in early September , [ORG Funes  ] countermanded a decision by [PER Sanchez Ceren  ] regarding agriculture subsidies. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) IS [ORG FUNES  ] CONSIDERING CONFRONTING [MISC FMLN  ] HARDLINERS WHOM HE BELIEVES ARE UNDERMINING HIM ? 
HOW IS [ORG FUNES  ] COPING UNDER STRESS ? 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [MISC PolCouns  ] September 22 that the divorce between [ORG Funes  ] and the [MISC FMLN  ] wa final , pointing to the lack of public conflict as convincing evidence: the two sides are no longer even trying to work together . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] is convinced [MISC FMLN  ] hard-liners smuggled [MISC Honduran  ] President [PER Zelaya  ] into [LOC Tegucigalpa  ] September 21 without the knowledge of [ORG Funes  ] and in direct defiance of his efforts to keep the [LOC Honduras  ] conflict from playing out on [MISC Salvadoran  ] soil . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believes the relationship is beyond repair . 
We believe that [ORG Funes  ] distrusts the orthodox [MISC FMLN  ] , but is not able to break with the party at this time . 
He has some valuable [MISC FMLN  ] " lite " members of his cabinet , and would risk more active subversion and street protests if he broke with the party. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) WHO ARE CURRENTLY THE MOST INFLUENTIAL [MISC FMLN  ] LEADERS ? 
HOW DO THEY VIEW [ORG FUNES  ] ? 
HOW DOES [ORG FUNES  ] VIEW THEM ? 
WHAT PLANS DO THEY HAVE , IF ANY , TO STRENGTHEN THE FMLN'S INFLUENCE ? 
[MISC FMLN  ] General Coordinator [PER Medardo Gonzalez  ] , PARLACEN Deputies [PER Jose Luis Merino  ] and [PER Nidia Diaz  ] , and [ORG Salvadoran Assembly  ] Deputy [PER Sigfrido Reyes  ] continue to hold significant power within the [MISC FMLN  ] . 
[PER Hato Hasbun  ] , now Secretary for [ORG Strategic Affairs  ] in the presidential staff , straddles both worlds as an [MISC FMLN  ] insider and [ORG Funes  ] confidante . 
Within the hard-line faction of the [MISC FMLN  ] , it appears the influence of the [ORG BRV  ] and [PER Hugo Chavez  ] is on the rise , with some in the [MISC FMLN  ] capitalizing on the crisis in [LOC Honduras  ] to widen the breach between [ORG Funes  ] and party hard-liners . 
[PER Samayoa  ] was recently introduced ( by phone ) to [LOC Havana  ] 's new Charge d'Affaires and believes the [MISC Cubans  ] are planning to raise their profile in [LOC El Salvador  ] . 
[MISC FMLN  ] hard-liners engineered [MISC Funes'  ] selection as a pragmatic step to gain power , expecting they would eventually govern through [PER Funes  ] as their puppet . 
[ORG Funes  ] made a pragmatic decision to run for President on the [MISC FMLN  ] ticket , expecting to govern despite the opposition he expected would emerge from radical elements of the party . 
[LOC San Salvador  ] 's political pundits continue to speculate that the Friends of [PER Mauricio  ] ( now being rebranded the [ORG Citizen Movement for Change  ] ) will soon merge with the [MISC FMLN  ] 's smaller ally CD ( [ORG Democratic Change  ] ) giving them a base to win seats in 2012 legislative elections and a power base from which to negotiate . 
[LOC El Salvador  ] 's conservative business class continues to assess that working with [PER Funes  ] is the best avenue for protecting [MISC Salvadoran  ] democracy and their own business interests in the long run . 
A senior executive [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [MISC PolCouns  ] September 22 he thought [PER Funes  ] would wind up governing with the support of [LOC ARENA  ] and other conservative parties before his term was up. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) HAVE KEY SECURITY ORGANIZATION BUDGETS CHANGED ? 
IF SO , TO WHAT EXTENT ? 
[MISC Funes' Private  ] Secretar told us ( Ref ( B ) ) the President was disappointed in [PER Eduardo Linares  ] , new Director of the [ORG Salvadoran State Intelligence Organization  ] ( [ORG OIE  ] ) . 
In fact , [PER Funes  ] has privately commented on his complete lack of faith with [PER Linares  ] and the [ORG OIE  ] , whom [PER Funes  ] believes to be beholden to the hard-line factions of the [MISC FMLN  ] . 
Given [MISC Funes'  ] disappointment in and distrust of [PER Linares  ] , [PER Funes  ] has decided to shift a significant part of [ORG OIE  ] 's intelligence collection duties to the [LOC El Salvador  ] Armed Forces ( [ORG ESAF  ] ) . 
Even so , the [MISC CY2010  ] budget for the [ORG ESAF  ] was reduced [ORG USD  ] 6 million from its CY2009 level of [ORG USD  ] 132 million , a significant decrease considering over 90 percent of the budget is directed to salaries . 
Accordingly , [PER Funes  ] plans to also gradually reduce [ORG OIE  ] 's budget to further marginalize the Agency 's ability to operate effectively . 
[PER Hato Hasbun  ] has told us he envisages [ORG OIE  ] evolving into a more analytical than operational organization . 
Other sensitive reporting suggests a pending realignment of the [LOC GOES  ] intelligence apparatus. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) HOW DO AVERAGE [MISC SALVADORANS  ] SEE FUNES'S ACTIONS TO REDUCE CRIME , SPECIFICALLY THE MURDER RATE , IN THE COUNTRY ? 
DO [MISC FMLN  ] HARDLINERS IN GOVERNMENT VIEW THE ISSUE AS A KEY PRIORITY ? 
WHAT IS THE MOST RECENT OFFICIAL HOMICIDE RATE ? 
[MISC Salvadoran  ] press reported September 29 that as of September 28 , the number of murders in 2009 ( 3,182 ) had already exceeded the 2008 total ( 3,179 ) . 
This represents an annualized total of 4,286 killings if the current rate holds , or almost 12 per day in 2009 compared to a rate of nearly 9 per day in 2008 . 
This uptick in the homicide rate seems to have shocked even those [MISC Salvadorans  ] who had grown numb to the persistently high levels of violence in their country . 
September polling numbers from the [ORG University of Central America  ] 's [ORG IUDOP  ] polling institute suggest a majority of [MISC Salvadorans  ] are concerned about public security but remain willing to give the [ORG Funes Administration  ] time to address the problem . 
58.6 percent of respondents believe crime is growing worse since [PER Funes  ] took office , while 26.5 percent believe it is about the same and only 14.9 percent believe it is improving . 
Respondents were almost evenly split as to whether [MISC Funes'  ] public security policies represent more of the same ( 48.9 percent ) or a change ( 49.9 percent ) from policies of the [LOC Saca  ] administration . 
67.8 percent of respondents believe [MISC Funes'  ] security policies will have some or a significant effect on crime , while 32.3 percent believe they will have little or no effect . 
However , 51.9 percent of respondents thought [MISC Funes'  ] public security policies were having little to no effect while 48.0 percent believed they were , in fact , showing results already . 
[MISC FMLN  ] hardliners are concerned more with obtaining operational control over the [ORG PNC  ] than they are with reducing the crime rate . 
The biographies of some of these hardliners include involvement in murder ( [ORG Melgar  ] , [PER Sanchez Ceren  ] , [PER Nidia Diaz  ] ) , kidnapping ( [PER Sanchez Ceren  ] ) , and arms trafficking ( [PER Merino  ] ) , so their commitment to law and order cannot be easily assumed .
