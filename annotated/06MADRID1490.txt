End Summary. //BILATERAL RELATIONS IMPROVING// <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Vice President de [PER la Vega  ] said she was aware of FM [PER Miguel Angel Moratinos'  ] upcoming meeting with the Secretary , as well as MOD [PER Alonso  ] 's June 8 meeting with Secretary [PER Rumsfeld  ] on the margins of the [ORG NATO  ] ministerial . 
She expressed satisfaction with the improvements in the bilateral relationship over the last year . 
The Ambassador agreed that we had made progress , adding that there was much more that our countries could do together . 
The Ambassador congratulated the [ORG Zapatero Government  ] for its handling of the thorny [MISC Catalan  ] autonomy issue . 
[ORG De la  ] [PER Vega  ] said that the [ORG Zapatero  ] administration was convinced that the [MISC Catalan  ] issue was nearing a successful conclusion and predicted that the June 18 referendum in the [ORG Catalan Region  ] would go smoothly and result in public acceptance of a renegotiated autonomy statute . 
The Ambassador reviewed his plans to visit the [ORG Basque Region  ] June 22-23 , a visit focused on business issues , but also including a courtesy call on [ORG Basque Regional Government  ] leader [PER Juan Jose Ibarretxe  ] . 
Vice President de [PER la Vega  ] expressed no concern regarding such a visit. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The Ambassador informed de [PER la Vega  ] of the June 28-29 visit of Education Secretary Spellings , noting Secretary [PER Spellings'  ] strong background on foreign affairs and lengthy government career . 
He said that while he would not normally suggest Vice President de [PER la Vega  ] meet visiting cabinet officials , it could be worthwhile to arrange a brief meeting . 
[ORG De la  ] [PER Vega  ] said she would welcome such a meeting if her schedule permitted. //CIA FLIGHTS// <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The Ambassador said that FM Moratinos had recently advised him that [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG National Court  ] had accepted a case filed by a private individual alleging [ORG USG  ] wrongdoing in [LOC Spain  ] during the transit of [MISC Spanish  ] airports by [ORG CIA  ] aircraft . 
Moratinos indicated the [MISC Spanish  ] Government 's desire to give this issue as low a profile as possible , though , as a judicial case , the government had a limited capacity to influence the direction of the case . 
[ORG De la  ] [PER Vega  ] said she was aware of FM [PER Moratinos'  ] communication on this issue and expressed confidence that the [ORG Zapatero Government  ] could manage it with little difficulty . 
( NOTE: According to June 9 press reports , government prosecutors have expressed opposition to the [ORG National Court  ] 's hearing of a case in which there is no evidence of a crime having been committed . 
END NOTE ) . <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) By contrast , she said , the [ORG Zapatero Government  ] had been surprised by the [ORG Council of Europe  ] report alleging that [LOC Spain  ] " permitted or failed to investigate " the use of [LOC Mallorca  ] as a staging point for the " illegal " transfer of individuals by the [ORG CIA  ] . 
( NOTE: An MFA spokesperson roundly denied any involvement by [LOC Spain  ] in the illegal transfer of [LOC MADRID  ] 00001490 002.2 OF 003 suspected terrorists . 
END NOTE ) . 
[ORG De la  ] [PER Vega  ] said [LOC Spain  ] was prepared to deal with this issue , but wanted to be certain that it had all the information available regarding the flights to avoid being caught unprepared . 
The Ambassador noted that we too had an interest in preserving our credibility and were careful to share whatever information we had and to avoid any actions that might create problems for the [MISC Spanish  ] authorities . 
[ORG De la  ] [PER Vega  ] emphasized that [LOC Spain  ] had no objection to [ORG USG  ] intelligence flights through [MISC Spanish  ] territory ; they simply wanted to be kept informed and , if necessary , to be able to demonstrate that they were exercising proper oversight of foreign aircraft passing through [LOC Spain.  ] //IRAN , SYRIA// <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The Ambassador recounted his last meeting with President [ORG Zapatero  ] , during which [ORG Zapatero  ] identified [LOC Iran  ] as the greatest threat to peace in the Broader [LOC Middle East  ] . 
The Ambassador said this was precisely the view of the [ORG USG  ] and that this underscored the importance of the [ORG USG  ] 's historic decision to directly join the multilateral discussions with [LOC Iran  ] . 
He said it was vital at this critical phase that [LOC Iran  ] see a united international front , determined to prevent its production of nuclear weapons . 
Vice President de [PER la Vega  ] emphatically agreed , saying [PER Javier Solana  ] was the appropriate interlocutor to deliver a unified message to [LOC Iran  ] . 
The Ambassador conveyed a similar message on the need to maintain the consensus limiting high level contacts with [LOC Syria  ] in order to prevent [LOC Damascus  ] from driving a wedge between allies . 
Vice President de [PER la Vega  ] agreed on this point as well. //PERU , [LOC BOLIVIA  ] , [LOC ARGENTINA//  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Vice President de [PER la Vega  ] expressed satisfaction with the " good news " of [PER Alan Garcia  ] 's victory in [LOC Peru  ] , but lamented that [MISC Bolivian  ] President [PER Evo Morales  ] seemed to be under the sway of his extreme left Vice President . 
Without naming [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Chavez  ] , de [PER la Vega  ] indicated [LOC Spain  ] 's conviction that other " negative influences " were also at work in [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
The Ambassador said that [PER Chavez  ] was certainly eager to exert influence , but that [PER Castro  ] was likely just as involved , though with more subtlety than [PER Chavez  ] . 
De la [PER Vega  ] said that one positive development resulting from [LOC Chavez'  ] meddling was realization by [MISC Brazilian  ] President [PER Lula da Silva  ] that [PER Chavez  ] represented a genuine threat to [MISC Brazilian  ] interests in the region , just as [MISC Peruvian  ] President-elect [PER Garcia  ] , and to a lesser extent [MISC Chilean  ] President [PER Bachelet  ] , understood the nature of the threat. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The Ambassador asked for [LOC Spain  ] 's view on whether [MISC Argentine  ] President [PER Kirchner  ] was likewise growing wary of [PER Chavez  ] . 
De la [PER Vega  ] said that [PER Kirchner  ] was a special case , in that he felt a strong affinity towards both President [ORG Zapatero  ] and Vice President de [PER la Vega  ] . 
She said she believed [LOC Spain  ] could influence his actions in a positive direction and noted that he would be making a state visit to [LOC Spain  ] in the near future. //NORTH AFRICA// <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Turning to her previous meeting with the Ambassador , de [PER la Vega  ] recalled having urged the [ORG USG  ] to increase collaboration with [LOC Spain  ] in promoting stability in [LOC North Africa  ] . 
She asked whether the Ambassador saw any chance of progress on this issue . 
The Ambassador said that the [ORG USG  ] was actively considering various approaches on [LOC North Africa  ] , in light of the stalemate on [LOC Western Sahara  ] and other sources of tension . 
He suggested the [MISC Spanish  ] Government present the [ORG USG  ] and other interested parties a detailed explanation of how it intends to move forward on [LOC North Africa  ] and recommend what others could do to promote such an initiative . 
( NOTE: Our sense is that FM Moratinos may raise this issue in his June 19 meeting with the Secretary . 
END NOTE ) . //COMMENT// <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) As with the Ambassador 's last meeting with Vice President de [PER la Vega  ] in April , the atmosphere was relaxed and [LOC MADRID  ] 00001490 003.2 OF 003 cordial throughout . 
The key message being relayed by the [ORG Spanish Government  ] through the nature and frequency of these meetings is that they want to put bilateral relations on an even keel . 
They do not use these encounters to press for a meeting between Presidents [PER Bush  ] and [ORG Zapatero  ] , an objective they appear to have abandoned for the moment . 
Instead , the [ORG Zapatero Government  ] seems content to use the Vice President 's channel with the Ambassador to transmit where they see opportunities for cooperation ( [LOC Africa  ] , [LOC Latin America  ] ) and to assess the [ORG USG  ] 's view of the overall state of the bilateral relationship .
