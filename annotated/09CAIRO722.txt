[LOC CAIRO  ] 451 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Margaret Scobey  ] for reason 1.4 ( b ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
KEY POINTS: -- ( [ORG S  ] ) President [PER Mubarak  ] sees [LOC Iran  ] 's attempts to exert influence throughout the region as [LOC Egypt  ] 's primary strategic threat . 
However , [PER Mubarak  ] 's focus on the [MISC Iranian  ] threat differs somewhat from ours . 
While he will readily admit that the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear program is a strategic and existential threat to [LOC Egypt  ] and the region , he sees that threat as relatively " long term . 
" What has seized his immediate attention are [LOC Iran  ] 's non-nuclear destabilizing actions such as support for [ORG HAMAS  ] , media attacks , weapons and illicit funds smuggling , all of which add up in his mind to " [MISC Iranian  ] influence spreading like a cancer from the [ORG GCC  ] to [LOC Morocco  ] . 
" -- ( [ORG S  ] ) In particular , [LOC Egypt  ] views [LOC Iran  ] as an adversary that is trying to undermine [ORG GOE  ] efforts on [MISC Palestinian  ] reconciliation and preventing weapons smuggling to [LOC Gaza  ] , while endangering key [ORG GOE  ] interests such as stability in [LOC Lebanon  ] and [LOC Sudan.  ] -- ( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [ORG GOE  ] remains concerned with [MISC Iranian  ] efforts to interfere in [LOC Gaza  ] , [LOC Lebanon  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Sudan  ] , and [LOC Egypt  ] views the recently dismantled [ORG Sinai Hizballah  ] cell as an unacceptable [MISC Iranian  ] escalation. -- ( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG MFA  ] believes that a harder [LOC U.S.  ] line in [ORG UN  ] fora on [LOC Israel  ] 's nuclear program would strengthen the [LOC U.S.  ] position on demanding [LOC Iran  ] cease working to develop nuclear weapons. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Ambassador [PER Ross  ] , welcome to [LOC Egypt  ] . 
Your visit comes as [LOC Egypt  ] continues its efforts to mediate a permanent cease-fire between [LOC Israel  ] and [ORG Hamas  ] , to facilitate intra-Palestinian negotiations and to stop the smuggling of arms into [LOC Gaza  ] . 
The [ORG GOE  ] realizes that [LOC Iran  ] is working to undermine all of these [MISC Egyptian  ] efforts . 
Many [MISC Egyptians  ] see the new [ORG U.S. Administration  ] as a cause for optimism in both the bilateral relationship and in [LOC U.S.  ] engagement with the region . 
President [PER Mubarak  ] appears ready to accept President [PER Obama  ] 's invitation to visit [LOC Washington  ] within the next several months , which will mark his first visit to [LOC Washington  ] since April 2004 . 
Special Envoy for the [LOC Middle East  ] Senator [PER George Mitchell  ] has visited [LOC Egypt  ] and the region three times . 
While President [PER Mubarak  ] unfortunately will not be available , we have requested meetings for you with Foreign Minister [PER Aboul Gheit  ] , Intelligence Chief [PER Omar Soliman  ] , [ORG Arab League  ] Secretary-General [PER Amre Moussa  ] , [ORG National Democratic Party Assistant  ] Secretary-General [PER Gamal Mubarak  ] and Interior Minister [PER Habib Al-Adly.  ] ----------------- President [PER Mubarak  ] ----------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) President [PER Mubarak  ] has made it clear that he sees [LOC Iran  ] as [LOC Egypt  ] 's -- and the region 's -- primary strategic threat . 
His already dangerous neighborhood , he has stressed , has only become more so since the fall of [ORG Saddam  ] , who , as nasty as he was , nevertheless stood as a wall against [LOC Iran  ] , according to [PER Mubarak  ] . 
He now sees [LOC Tehran  ] 's hand moving with ease throughout the region , " from the [LOC Gulf  ] to [LOC Morocco  ] , " as he told a recent congressional delegation . 
The immediate threat to [LOC Egypt  ] comes from [MISC Iranian  ] conspiracies with [ORG Hamas  ] ( which he sees as the " offspring " of his own most dangerous internal political threat , the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] ) to stir up unrest in [LOC Gaza  ] , but he is also concerned about [MISC Iranian  ] machinations in [LOC Sudan  ] and their efforts to create havoc elsewhere in the region , including in [LOC Lebanon  ] via [ORG Hezbollah  ] . 
While [LOC Tehran  ] 's nuclear threat is also a cause for concern , [PER Mubarak  ] is more urgently seized with what he sees as the rise of pan-Shi'ism and [MISC Iranian  ] attempts to dominate the [LOC Middle East.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [MISC Egyptians  ] have been clear they do not intend to resume normal diplomatic ties with the [MISC Iranians  ] until specific political and security issues are addressed , including the renaming of " [LOC Islambouli Street  ] " named after [PER Sadat  ] 's assassin . 
The [ORG GOE  ] recognizes that [LOC Iran  ] 's long arm has extended into [LOC Gaza  ] via [ORG Hamas  ] , but the same time , they are worried that we are going to strike a " grand deal " with the [MISC Iranians  ] . 
Accordingly , the [MISC Egyptian  ] [ORG MFA  ] has reported to us that they are in touch with the [MISC Iranians  ] and " listen " to them on regional issues . 
The prevailing [ORG GOE  ] view remains a principled rejection of any diplomatic rapprochement , but we [LOC CAIRO  ] 00000722 002 OF 003 believe the [MISC Egyptians  ] are maintaining contact in the event there is a need for a quick shift in their approach . 
The [MISC Egyptians  ] are also marginally increasing cultural and economic ties with [LOC Iran  ] . 
The [MISC Egyptians  ] are also concerned about [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Shi'a  ] proselytizing in [LOC Egypt.  ] ----------------------- EGIS Chief [PER Omar Soliman  ] ----------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Soliman  ] , the key [ORG GOE  ] advisor on national security policy after President [PER Mubarak  ] , recently told us that [LOC Egypt  ] has started a confrontation with [ORG Hezbollah  ] and [LOC Iran  ] and will not allow [LOC Iran  ] to operate in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
[PER Soliman  ] has noted that after the [ORG GOE  ] 's recent arrest of a [ORG Hizballah  ] cell in the [LOC Sinai  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] had sent a clear message to [LOC Iran  ] that if they interfere in [LOC Egypt  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] will interfere in [LOC Iran  ] , adding that EGIS had already begun recruiting agents in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Syria  ] . 
[PER Soliman  ] has warned us against only focusing on one issue at time , such as [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear weapons program . 
He believes [LOC Iran  ] must pay the price for its actions and not be allowed to interfere in regional affairs . 
[PER Soliman  ] has offered [ORG GOE  ] cooperation on [LOC Iran  ] , and welcomes a [MISC U.S.-Egyptian  ] partnership on combating [MISC Iranian  ] influence in the region. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Soliman  ] recently noted that [MISC Iranian  ] financial support to [ORG Hamas  ] amounted to $25 million a month , but that [LOC Egypt  ] was " succeeding " in preventing financial support from entering [LOC Gaza  ] through [LOC Egypt  ] . 
According to [PER Soliman  ] , [LOC Iran  ] has tried several times to pay the salaries for the al-Qassam Battalions , but [LOC Egypt  ] had succeeded in preventing the money from reaching [LOC Gaza  ] . 
[PER Soliman  ] has expressed concern over [ORG Hezbollah  ] 's first attempt to stand up a cell within [LOC Egypt  ] , and noted to us that [LOC Iran  ] was also trying to recruit support from the [LOC Sinai Bedouins  ] , he claimed , in order to facilitate arms smuggling to [LOC Gaza.  ] ---------------------------- Foreign Minister [PER Aboul Gheit  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Aboul Gheit  ] has speculated that the new [ORG U.S. Administration  ] will engage with [LOC Iran  ] , but will be disappointed in late 2009 or early 2010 when it realizes that [LOC Iran  ] will not stop its enrichment activities . 
[PER Aboul Gheit  ] believes [LOC Israel  ] may then attack [LOC Iran  ] . 
According to [PER Aboul Gheit  ] , the " intransigence " of [LOC Israel  ] and [LOC Iran  ] will place the [LOC U.S.  ] in an awkward position with the [MISC Islamic  ] world . 
[PER Aboul Gheit  ] will reiterate President [PER Mubarak  ] 's strong opinion that the only real solution is a nuclear free zone in the [LOC Middle East  ] , which would require [LOC Israel  ] to give up its nuclear weapons . 
[PER Aboul Gheit  ] believes that while the [LOC U.S.  ] may not perceive a nuclear-armed [LOC Israel  ] as a threat , it is so perceived throughout the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
In the Foreign Minister 's opinion , if the [LOC U.S.  ] pushed [LOC Israel  ] to renounce nuclear weapons , the [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Arab  ] governments would be in a much stronger position to demand that [LOC Iran  ] end its nuclear program. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG MFA  ] officials have made it clear to us that they do not expect [LOC Israel  ] to give up its nuclear weapons in the absence of comprehensive regional peace ; however , the [ORG GOE  ] is frustrated with what it perceives as a lack of political progress in international fora to advance the [LOC Middle East  ] Resolution that came out of the 1995 Nuclear [PER Proliferation Treaty  ] ( [ORG NPT  ] ) [ORG Review Conference  ] , which called in part for a [LOC Middle East  ] Nuclear Weapons Free Zone ( [ORG MENWFZ  ] ) . 
The [ORG GOE  ] 's campaign for progress on the eventual establishment of a [ORG MENWFZ  ] -- even if the ultimate goal remains far in the future -- will likely guide their approach to the 2009 [ORG NPT Preparatory Conference  ] in May and the 2010 [ORG NPT Review Conference.  ] ------------------------------------ [ORG Arab League  ] Secretary-General [PER Moussa  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Moussa  ] has publicly and privately minimized [LOC Iran  ] 's threat , claiming that the [MISC Arab  ] world should strengthen its economic and cultural ties with [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Moussa  ] believes that the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] conflict poses the greatest danger to the region , and has consistently pressed the [LOC U.S.  ] to do more to stop [MISC Israeli  ] settlement activity and advance the political process between [MISC Israelis  ] and [MISC Palestinians  ] . 
The [ORG Arab League  ] 's views on the importance of advancing a [LOC Middle East  ] nuclear weapons free zone are similar to those of the [ORG MFA  ] . 
[PER Moussa  ] also plays an important role in trying to manage intra-Arab squabbles , including [MISC Qatar-Syria  ] vs. [LOC Egypt-Saudi Arabia  ] . 
The [MISC Egyptians  ] have made it clear that they consider the [ORG Qataris CAIRO  ] 00000722 003 OF 003 " nouveau riche upstarts " who are trying to buy their way to influence via big spending and posing as the " true " champions of the [MISC Palestinian  ] cause by allying themselves with [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Iran  ] . 
The [MISC Qatari  ] attempt to invite [LOC Iran  ] to the [ORG Doha Arab League  ] summit incensed the [MISC Egyptians  ] , many of whom blamed [PER Moussa  ] for mismanaging the issue. ---------------------- Interior Minister [PER Adly  ] ---------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Interior Minister General [PER Habib Al-Adly  ] focuses on counterterrorism and suppressing domestic political opposition . 
He will not offer strategic analysis of [LOC Iran  ] role in the region , but should be able to provide details on the nascent [ORG Hizballah  ] cell in the [LOC Sinai  ] , which the [ORG GOE  ] recently dismantled and arrested . 
[PER Adly  ] may also be able to share information on the steps the [ORG GOE  ] is taking to disrupt the flow of Iranian-supplied arms from [LOC Sudan  ] through [LOC Egypt  ] to [LOC Gaza  ] . 
In March , he told us that [MISC Egyptian  ] police had killed arms smugglers trying to transfer weapons from [LOC Sudan  ] into [LOC Egypt  ] ( ref C ) . 
He has described [ORG GOE  ] efforts to combat smuggling over the long [MISC Egyptian-Sudanese  ] border region as " difficult . 
" ------------- [PER Gamal Mubarak  ] -------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Ruling [ORG National Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG NDP  ] ) Assistant Secretary-General and Presidential son [PER Gamal Mubarak  ] does not currently play a significant role in [LOC Egypt  ] 's formal foreign policy process , focusing instead on [ORG NDP  ] matters and economic development . 
[PER Gamal  ] 's recent trip to [LOC Washington  ] raised his political profile in [LOC Egypt  ] , and he is of course a possible successor to his father . 
As a [MISC UK-trained  ] former international banker , [PER Gamal  ] is perhaps most at home discussing economics and the current financial crisis. ------------------------------- Internal Politics and Economics ------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) We continue to promote democratic reform in [LOC Egypt  ] , including the expansion of political freedom and pluralism , and respect for human rights . 
[MISC Egyptian  ] democracy and human rights efforts , however , are being stymied , and the [ORG GoE  ] remains skeptical of our role in democracy promotion , complaining that any efforts to open up will result in empowering the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] , which currently holds 86 seats in [LOC Egypt  ] 's 454-seat parliament . 
Economic reform is ongoing although [LOC Egypt  ] still suffers from widespread poverty affecting 35-40% of the population . 
[ORG Egyptian-U.S.  ] trade has more than doubled in the last four years , reaching almost $9 billion in 2008 . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] exports to [LOC Egypt  ] about twice as much as it imports . 
[MISC Egyptian  ] banks operate very conservatively and have been spared involvement in risky financial products , but the effects of the global economic crisis on [LOC Egypt  ] are beginning to be felt . 
As the global credit crunch worsens , [LOC Egypt  ] remains vulnerable as exports , [LOC Suez Canal  ] revenues , tourism , and remittances -- its largest sources of revenue -- are all down and likely to continue to fall .
