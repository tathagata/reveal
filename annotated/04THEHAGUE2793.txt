( C ) Summary . 
In a series of meetings on September 28 at the [ORG International Criminal Tribunal  ] for the former [LOC Yugoslavia  ] ( [ORG ICTY  ] ) , President [PER Meron  ] , Chief Prosecutor [PER Del Ponte  ] , and [PER Registrar Holthuis  ] struck consistent themes with Ambassador-at-Large for [MISC War Crimes Issues Pierre Prosper  ] and EUR DAS for [MISC Southeast Europe Kathy Stephens  ] . 
All [ORG ICTY  ] officials lamented the continued lack of cooperation with [LOC Serbia  ] and [LOC Montenegro  ] on fugitives and welcomed the [ORG USG  ] , s renewed tough message to [LOC Belgrade  ] . 
[ORG ICTY  ] officials were similarly receptive to efforts by the [ORG USG  ] to coordinate a similar policy line with the [MISC Europeans  ] , linking the [ORG EU  ] accession process with progress on cooperation . 
While describing efforts to facilitate the transfer of cases to the region , [ORG ICTY  ] officials underscored their deep concern about the continuing hiring freeze imposed on the [ORG Tribunal  ] by the [ORG UN  ] and noted its significant negative impact on the [ORG ICTY  ] , s ability to meet completion strategy goals . 
End summary. ------------------- The Prosecution ------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Prosper  ] joined by EUR DAS [MISC Stephens  ] , EUR/SCE officer [PER Jennifer Mitchell  ] and [ORG Embassy  ] legal officers , opened their visit by meeting with Chief Prosecutor [PER Carla Del Ponte  ] and her senior staff . 
[PER Prosper  ] and [MISC Stephens  ] expressed deep concern with the lack of cooperation by [LOC Belgrade  ] and stressed the need to reevaluate current policy in the region in order to increase pressure and incentives on [LOC Belgrade  ] to cooperate with the [ORG ICTY  ] . 
[PER Del Ponte  ] welcomed this objective but expressed concern that earlier [ORG USG  ] remarks about the possibility of transferring the four generals to [LOC Serbia  ] for trial were premature , being used as a pretext by [LOC Belgrade  ] to cease all efforts to bring about the transfer of fugitives below the [MISC Mladic  ] level , and , more generally , encouraging [MISC Serb  ] officials and fugitives to try to wait out the [ORG ICTY  ] , s completion . 
[PER Prosper  ] explained that [LOC Belgrade  ] had been given an opportunity to produce results and that the policy of showing an openness to support transfers back to the region for domestic trail " " hasn , t worked to date . 
" " What is needed , he said , is a stronger message to " " make clear in the region that noncooperation will result in extending the life of the [ORG Tribunal  ] . 
" " [PER Del Ponte  ] and her staff supported the idea of a firmer message but advised that the [ORG USG  ] should avoid stating specific requirements of cooperation because [ORG SAM  ] would respond by only meeting those requirements , and then only to draw out the process of cooperation on those few things . 
Senior political adviser [PER Jean-Daniel Ruch  ] urged that the message should be , " " you know what to do , start doing it . 
" " <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Ruch  ] said that he would urge his contacts in [LOC Brussels  ] , on the staff of [PER Javier Solana  ] and [PER Chris Patten  ] , to reinforce the tough message on [LOC Belgrade  ] , s cooperation . 
He pointed out that in June 2004 , the [ORG EU  ] had stated that as long as [MISC Mladic  ] , [PER Karadzic  ] , and [ORG Gotovina  ] remained at large , the [ORG Tribunal  ] should not close its doors . 
[PER Del Ponte  ] welcomed [MISC Stephens  ] , s focus on coordinating a tough message with the [ORG EU  ] as " " extremely important " " and said she supported a unified message of the sort announced by the [ORG EU  ] ministers and endorsed by Ambassador [PER Prosper  ] . 
Note . 
On October 4 , [PER Del Ponte  ] met with [PER Solana  ] and urged him to deliver a stiff message to [ORG SAM  ] on the need to cooperate fully in order for their to be progress on [ORG EU  ] accession issues . 
End note. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Speaking to [ORG OTP  ] , s overall frustration with [MISC Serb  ] noncooperation , [PER Del Ponte  ] reported that , according to a conversation she had with the chairman of the [ORG National Council for Cooperation  ] with the [ORG ICTY  ] , [PER Rasim Ljajic  ] , " " [LOC Kostunica  ] believes the [LOC United States  ] only wants [MISC Mladic  ] and that is the reason they are not arresting the others . 
" " Chief of Investigations [PER Patrick Lopez-Terres  ] cited [MISC RS  ] police sources who complain that the [LOC Belgrade  ] police are not helping them . 
But he also expressed concern about the " " complete radio silence " " with respect to search operations conducted by [MISC Serb  ] authorities and the lack of feedback with respect to fugitive information passed by the [ORG ICTY  ] . 
Increasingly , he said , his office cannot track [LOC Belgrade  ] , s work on fugitives. ------------ The Court ------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) President [PER Theodor Meron  ] , joined by chief of staff [PER Larry Johnson  ] , focused on the [ORG ICTY  ] , s budget crisis , which he called a " " real plague " " on the [ORG Tribunal  ] . 
[PER Meron  ] noted that the main result of the crisis is the hiring freeze . 
It has affected all of the [ORG Tribunal  ] , s main activities , from judicial decisionmaking ( although the Chambers received permission to fill nine vital clerkship positions , new vacancies have since arisen ) to [ORG OTP  ] investigations and prosecutions ( [ORG OTP  ] is hemorrhaging senior investigators and prosecutors to places like the [ORG Oil For Food  ] investigation and the [ORG International Criminal Court  ] and is unable to fill the vacancies ) to transitioning cases to the region ( [ORG OTP  ] cannot staff a new transition team to facilitate the transfer of cases to the region until it can fill vacancies ) . 
[PER Meron  ] urged the [ORG USG  ] to provide its assessed contribution as soon as possible in order to convince U/SYG [PER Bertini  ] to lift the freeze . 
[PER Meron  ] was pleased to learn that the [LOC United States  ] expected to make a 13 million USD contribution by early October and that another 10 million USD would follow this autumn . 
( Note . 
Post understands that both [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC Japan  ] , the other major contributors in arrears have now paid all or most of their outstanding balances . 
The [LOC US  ] paid $14.3 million in October and expects to pay the remaining balance of $8.8 million shortly . 
End note . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Meron  ] expressed concern that the [ORG BiH State Prosecutor 's Special Department  ] for [ORG Organized Crime and Corruption  ] has complicated the process of creating the war crimes chamber in [LOC Sarajevo  ] by issuing a war crimes indictment before the chamber has been established , thereby sending mixed signals regarding the readiness of [MISC BiH  ] to adjudicate domestic war crimes cases . 
[PER Prosper  ] and [PER Meron  ] agreed that cooperation from local governments is a critical dimension in the success of the 11bis trials referred to the local courts . 
[PER Meron  ] said that the [ORG Tribunal  ] must be " " very careful " " about the transfer of detainees who might be considered senior-level , not only because of the [ORG Security Council  ] expectation that such persons would be tried in The [ORG Hague  ] but also because of the signals that could send to senior-level fugitives . 
[PER Meron  ] also expressed a willingness to work with the [ORG USG  ] in particular on urging [LOC Belgrade  ] to develop domestic capacity to prosecute war crimes , noting that he had good relations with the local [ORG SAM  ] Ambassador and other [ORG SAM  ] officials. --------------- The [ORG Registry  ] ---------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Registrar [PER Hans Holthuis  ] echoed [PER Meron  ] in focusing on the hiring freeze , which has forced the [ORG Tribunal  ] to maintain a fifteen ( 15 ) percent staff vacancy rate , well above the normal 3 to 4 percent rate . 
This includes positions lost to normal attrition that remain unfilled . 
[PER Prosper  ] indicated that he would follow-up with [ORG USUN  ] and the [ORG UN  ] leadership in an effort to lift the hiring freeze , at least to fill vacancies due to normal attrition. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Holthuis  ] described various initiatives under way to enhance [ORG Tribunal  ] efficiency and further progress towards completion . 
He said that the [ORG Registry  ] is examining ways in which to schedule more than the present six trials in its three courtrooms , noting that it might be possible to schedule contempt hearings and other short proceedings during gaps in the major trials . 
[PER Holthuis  ] also reviewed outreach and training efforts underway in [LOC Croatia  ] , [ORG SAM  ] , and [MISC BiH  ] to help build up local trial capacity. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Comment: The budget crisis is severely testing the [ORG OTP  ] , s capacity to carry out its remaining pre-indictment investigations and the [ORG Tribunal  ] , s capacity overall to continue with its six-trial maximum schedule . 
A quick lifting of the hiring freeze is essential not only to permit the [ORG Tribunal  ] to complete its work on time but also for it advance the transfer of cases involving mid and lower level perpetrators back to the region for trial . 
All [ORG ICTY  ] leaders are focused on the capacity of jurisdictions in the region to prosecute war crimes cases at a level that meets international standards . 
[ORG OTP  ] and Chambers are particularly focused on the capacity of the [LOC Sarajevo  ] war crimes chamber to handle 11bis cases as early as this January , since this constitutes by far the largest category of cases eligible to be transferred . 
[ORG OTP  ] has also begun testing [LOC Belgrade  ] , s capacity to conduct effective and fair war crimes trials by providing the special war crimes court there with complete investigative files in two cases . 
If these cases go well , the [ORG Tribunal  ] is prepared to add others in the pipeline . 
[ORG ICTY  ] and [ORG USG  ] officials shared the sense that cooperation with [LOC Belgrade  ] is at a crossroads . 
The promising start of domestic war crimes trials points a clear way towards the future , but that opportunity as well as progress towards [MISC European  ] integration will be squandered if political levels fail to produce the long overdue results with respect to fugitives .
