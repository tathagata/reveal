End Summary . 
INVESTMENT SURGE .. . 
2 . 
( C ) With the lifting of [ORG UN  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] sanctions , foreign investment has surged back in to [LOC Libya  ] over the past three years . 
-- [LOC U.S.  ] companies adopted a number of return strategies , from buying back old concessions ( Marathon and [ORG ConocoPhillips  ] ) , winning bids for new blocs ( [ORG Chevron  ] and [ORG ExxonMobil  ] ) , or a combination of both ( [ORG Amerada Hess  ] and [ORG Oxy  ] ) . 
Since January 2005 , there have been three Exploration and Production Sharing ( [ORG EPSA  ] ) rounds , in which exploration areas have been competitively bid to foreign companies . 
These steps have produced a flurry of new work , as the more than forty international oil companies ( exclusive of oil service companies ) toil to discover marketable quantities of oil and gas . 
-- Several new " one-off " deals have also been concluded , including massive deals with [ORG Shell  ] and [ORG British Petroleum  ] , and a 25-year extension of [MISC Italian  ] company [ORG ENI  ] 's oil and gas [ORG EPSA  ] 's . 
-- The [ORG GOL  ] has also shown a growing interest in developing its natural gas capabilities ; an [ORG EPSA  ] round for gas will come to a close this December. .. . 
SPARKS NATIONALIST RHETORIC , POLICIES 3 . 
( C ) With this inflow of capital , and in particular the return of international oil companies ( [ORG IOCs  ] ) , there has been growing evidence of [MISC Libyan  ] resource nationalism . 
The regime has made a point of putting companies on notice that " exploitative " behavior will not be tolerated . 
In his annual speech marking the founding of his regime , [MISC Libyan  ] leader [PER Muammar Qadhafi  ] in 2006 said: " Oil companies are controlled by foreigners who have made millions from them -- now , [MISC Libyans  ] must take their place to profit from this money . 
" His son , [PER Seif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi , said in March 2007 that , " We will not tolerate a foreign company to make a profit at the expense of a [MISC Libyan  ] citizen . 
" 4 . 
( C ) Beyond the rhetoric , there are other signs of growing resource nationalism . 
-- Some [ORG IOCs  ] with local subsidiaries have been forced to adopt [MISC Libyan  ] names this year , including TOTAL ( now officially titled " [MISC Mabruk  ] " ) , [ORG Repsol  ] ( " [MISC Akakoss  ] " ) , [ORG ENI  ] ( " [MISC Mellita  ] " ) and [ORG Veba  ] ( " [MISC Al-Hurruj  ] " ) , although these names have yet to catch on . 
-- The [ORG Libyan National Oil Corporation  ] ( [ORG NOC  ] ) is currently in the process of reworking long-standing oil concessions with several different [ORG IOCs  ] ( Ref B ) , in an effort to wring more favorable terms . 
There is a growing concern in the [ORG IOC  ] community that [ORG NOC  ] , emboldened by soaring oil prices and the press of would-be suitors , will seek better terms on both concession and production-sharing agreements , even those signed very recently . 
-- [MISC Libyan  ] labor laws have also been amended to " Libyanize " the economy in several key sectors , and [ORG IOCs  ] are now being forced to hire untrained [MISC Libyan  ] employees . 
The [ORG Libyan National Oil Company  ] ( [ORG NOC  ] ) has recently begun insisting that deputy general managers , finance managers and human resource managers in local offices of [ORG IOC  ] 's be [MISC Libyan  ] . 
-- The enactment of Law #443 of 2006 obligated most foreign companies to form joint ventures with [MISC Libyan  ] companies in order to operate in the country . 
( [PER Note: This  ] currently excludes [ORG IOCs  ] , but includes all foreign oil and gas service companies . 
End Note ) . 
5 . 
( C ) The latest [ORG EPSA  ] rounds could well prove to be a testing ground for how far [LOC Libya  ] will travel down this path . 
The intense competition of the bid rounds led to winning bids that [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000967 002 OF 002 are widely considered by hydrocarbon industry experts to be economically untenable . 
[MISC Chinese  ] and [MISC Russian  ] bids that allow companies to book only 7-10% of future production were hailed by [ORG NOC  ] Chairman [PER Shukri Ghanem  ] as " very good for us...and " [ clearly ] also good for the companies , since they submitted the offer " . 
HARMFUL TO LIBYA'S OWN INTERESTS ? 6 . 
( C ) There is widespread concern among industry experts , however , that [LOC Libya  ] 's zeal for deriving maximum financial benefit from oil/gas concessions will adversely impact its energy resource development in the mid- to long-term , as low-bidding companies will under-invest , under-perform and under-produce . 
The expectation is that some of the companies that submitted unfeasible bids will be forced to abandon their concessions , further delaying the development of [LOC Libya  ] 's energy infrastructure . 
[ORG COMMENT  ] 7 . 
( C ) [LOC Libya  ] needs to exploit its hydrocarbon resources to provide for its rapidly-growing , relatively young population . 
To do so , it requires extensive foreign investment and participation by credible [ORG IOCs  ] . 
Reformist elements in the [MISC Libyan  ] government and the small but growing private sector recognize this reality . 
But those who dominate [LOC Libya  ] 's political and economic leadership are pursuing increasingly nationalistic policies in the energy sector that could jeopardize efficient exploitation of [LOC Libya  ] 's extensive oil and gas reserves . 
Effective [LOC U.S.  ] engagement on this issue should take the form of demonstrating the clear downsides to the [ORG GOL  ] of pursuing this approach , particularly with respect to attracting participation by credible international oil companies in the oil/gas sector and foreign direct investment .
