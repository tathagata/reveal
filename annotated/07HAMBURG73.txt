( C ) [MISC SUMMARY: Since  ] the creation of the [ORG Working Group  ] on Scientology ( [ORG AGS  ] ) in 1992 within its interior ministry with its firebrand leader , [LOC Hamburg  ] has been at sharp odds with the [ORG Church of Scientology  ] and more recently has taken a leading role in an attempt to ban the organization . 
On August 7 , Hamburg’s Interior Minister [PER Udo Nagel  ] ( independent ) announced the proposal to ban Scientology under [MISC Germany’s  ] Law of Associations . 
In November , the [ORG Hamburg State Parliament  ] mandated him with submitting the proposal to the state interior ministers at their December meeting . 
Leadership within the [LOC Hamburg  ] interior ministry , including from the [ORG Office for the Protection of the Constitution  ] ( [ORG OPC  ] ) , has confirmed to ConGen [LOC Hamburg  ] that the proposal is mainly politically motivated and that they expect the issue to die down at the latest after state elections in [LOC Bavaria  ] . 
This cable examines the background to the heightened debate over Scientology in [LOC Hamburg  ] . 
END SUMMARY . 
[ORG HAMBURG’S WORKING GROUP  ] ON [ORG SCIENTOLOGY  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( SBU ) In 1992 , the [ORG Hamburg State Parliament  ] created the [ORG Working Group  ] on Scientology ( Arbeitsgruppe Scientology or [ORG AGS  ] ) within the [LOC Hamburg  ] interior ministry mandated to address all “destructive groups , ” which endanger society , in particular young people . 
[ORG AGS  ] not only focuses on Scientology’s activities within [LOC Hamburg  ] , but also other organizations such as the [ORG Church of Satan  ] , [MISC Transcendental Meditation  ] , and the [ORG Unification Church  ] . 
According to [ORG AGS  ] Director [PER Ursula Caberta  ] , [ORG AGS  ] and the [LOC Hamburg  ] interior ministry view Scientology as a “politically motivated destructive cult.” Thus , [PER Caberta  ] explained , as a state institution , it is their duty to protect the public from such organizations . 
In her meeting with Hamburg’s Pol/Econ Officer and Specialist on November 13 , she stressed that she viewed her work as that of a civil servant assigned to do a particular job by the state parliament . 
Currently , AGS’s responsibilities are three-fold: 1 ) to analyze what steps the state must take to protect the public from “destructive groups ; ” 2 ) to educate the public about the dangers of such organizations ; and 3 ) to assist victims . 
[LOC Hamburg  ] is the only state in [LOC Germany  ] with a Scientology working group . 
Under Caberta’s leadership the working group has five employees . 
[ORG AGS  ] offices were filled with books on Scientology , including all of [PER L. Ron Hubbard’s  ] works and many of his lectures . 
EUROPE UNDER ATTACK ? <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Caberta  ] stated that Scientology has declared “war on [MISC Europe.” She  ] cited evidence from Hamburg’s Office for the Protection of the [MISC Constitution  ] ( [ORG OPC  ] ) annual reports of how Scientology attempts to influence politicians and political institutions as well as the press . 
According to the [LOC Hamburg  ] OPC’s 2006 report , Scientology continues to use methods that are “against the free , democratic constitutional structure , ” as was established in the 1997 State Interior Ministers meeting . 
[PER Caberta  ] asserted that [ORG Scientology  ] in [LOC Germany  ] has received orders from the [LOC Los Angeles  ] headquarters to “conquer” [LOC Europe  ] . 
She contends that the new [LOC Berlin  ] headquarters have been set up for this “campaign.” She continually stressed that she views [ORG Scientology  ] not as a religious organization , but as a “political extremist” one . 
According to [PER Caberta  ] , the [ORG Hamburg Scientologists  ] as well as most of the [ORG Scientology  ] members in [LOC Germany  ] are only “small fish” and the organization’s strategic planning is conducted in the [LOC United States  ] . 
[PER Caberta  ] showed Pol/Econ Officer and Specialist a booklet she had received early November that appeared to be published by Hamburg’s mayor . 
The booklet contained the mayor’s photograph and signature , yet was actually a publication from Scientology’s “The Way to Happiness Foundation.” [PER Caberta  ] contended that [ORG Scientology  ] regularly used misleading methods to fool individuals into joining and said that such booklets had been distributed to other [MISC German  ] cities . 
For someone unfamiliar with Scientology publications , the booklet looked very much like information brochures from the [ORG City of Hamburg.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In a meeting at the consulate on December 19 , [LOC Hamburg  ] [ORG OPC  ] leadership explained that it was a political decision for the [ORG HAMBURG  ] 00000073 002.2 OF 003 state OPCs to observe Scientology , based upon the “totalitarian assertions” described in [PER L. Ron Hubbard’s  ] writings . 
They called their observation of Scientology “special , ” making it clear that they did not view the organization as a threat and that it was their responsibility to only collect information and not to pass judgment on the organization . 
They noted that while the [ORG OPC  ] does not view Scientology as a religious organization , this would have no bearing on their work as the [ORG OPC  ] observes both religious and non-religious institutions . 
CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY’S TAKE <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In Hamburg’s Pol/Econ Officer and Specialist’s meetings with [ORG Hamburg Scientology  ] figures , our contacts made it clear that the [LOC Hamburg  ] church faces a particularly challenging situation with [PER Caberta  ] , who is now considered [MISC Germany’s  ] “expert” on Scientology . 
They also noted that [LOC Hamburg  ] is the only [MISC German  ] state that has a Scientology working group , although Berlin’s ministry for education has a “sect-watcher” position . 
( Note: In a meeting on December 14 , [LOC Hamburg  ] Deputy State Minister of the Interior [PER Christoph Ahlhaus  ] told [PER CG Johnson  ] that [LOC Berlin  ] has been trying to convince [PER Caberta  ] to transfer there . 
End Note . 
) Scientology press spokesman [PER Frank Busch  ] claimed that [ORG AGS  ] is exempt from the [MISC German  ] version of the [ORG Freedom of Information Act  ] . 
He complained that [PER Caberta  ] is “above the law” and her work is not being assessed or monitored by the interior ministry . 
[PER Busch  ] questioned why this lack of scrutiny existed since Scientology found her work to be one-sided , factually incorrect , and “playing with the people’s emotions.” They believe that a normal citizen would have difficulty gathering objective information on Scientology in [LOC Hamburg  ] . 
According to [PER Busch  ] , none of Hamburg’s public libraries have any of [PER L. Ron Hubbard’s  ] books . 
Scientology members are not allowed to distribute flyers in the city and private individuals allegedly monitor whether members overstep these boundaries . 
[PER Busch  ] also claimed that [ORG Hamburg’s Chamber of Commerce  ] still screens out Scientology members from hiring and encourages members to do so as well , even though the city of [LOC Hamburg  ] has ceased such practices ( known locally as a “sect-filter” ) . 
( Note: Documents containing the “filter” are available on-line at the [ORG Chamber of Commerce’s  ] webpage . 
End Note . 
) NAGEL’S PROPOSAL TO BAN SCIENTOLOGY <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) On August 7 at the press release of Caberta’s “Black Book [PER Scientology” Nagel  ] announced that he would propose discussing banning Scientology at the December 7 state interior ministers meeting . 
In a conversation with Pol/Econ Specialist on August 13 , [ORG Hamburg Interior Ministry  ] Spokesman [PER Marco Haase  ] suggested that the announcement was the result of several unrelated occurrences , such as the recent publication of Caberta’s book , the case of the [LOC Berlin  ] girl and her brother seeking refuge in [LOC Hamburg  ] ( Ref . 
) , the attention to Scientology generated during the filming of the movie “Valkyrie” in [LOC Berlin  ] , in which [PER Tom Cruise  ] stars , and the summer media slump . 
According to [PER Haase  ] , [PER Nagel  ] believes that a ban alone is not the answer . 
Rather , assistance to ex-Scientologists and education on Scientology also have important roles to play . 
[PER Nagel  ] also believes that there is sufficient evidence suggesting that Scientology undertakes activities that undermine the [MISC German  ] constitution. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) In a meeting on December 14 with Hamburg’s CG and Pol/Econ Officer , Hamburg’s Deputy State Minister for the Interior [PER Christoph Ahlhaus  ] clarified that [PER Nagel  ] certainly believes that Scientology should be banned , but he also realizes the political difficulties of such an endeavor . 
[PER Ahlhaus  ] explained that the [LOC Hamburg  ] parliament charged [PER Nagel  ] in a unanimous decision on November 11 to propose the ban at the interior ministers meeting . 
He also stated that the ministry’s involvement in the issue stems foremost from the criminal cases brought annually against Scientology . 
[PER Ahlhaus  ] said these numbered over 100 and had been increasing significantly . 
He also explained that the issue of Scientology was very popular with voters and confirmed that it had come up because of the February 24 [LOC Hamburg  ] state elections . 
[PER Ahlhaus  ] expected that findings would be addressed at the interior ministers’ spring meeting and that perhaps the issue would come up again with the [MISC Bavarian  ] state elections next year . 
After that , he believed that the issue would fizzle out . 
[PER Ahlhaus  ] portrayed [LOC Hamburg  ] as Scientology’s [MISC German  ] headquarters and noted that the [ORG HAMBURG  ] 00000073 003.2 OF 003 organization is also present in [LOC Berlin  ] , [LOC Baden-Wurttemberg  ] , and [LOC Bavaria  ] , where banning Scientology also has political support . 
He commented that Scientology is almost like a “criminal organization” with Mafia-type structures . 
COMMENT <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) With a strong Scientology Church and the Scientology working group both located in [LOC Hamburg  ] , the debate on Scientology in [LOC Germany  ] reaches a zenith in this city . 
[PER Caberta  ] has become a national figure on the organization and [PER Ahlhaus  ] revealed that she often speaks to the press without clearing remarks through the interior ministry . 
He stated that [PER Nagel  ] believes she is a little “crazy” and assured the CG that Nagel’s office keeps a close watch on her activities . 
In the meantime , although [PER Nagel  ] is an independent , he has stakes in the upcoming elections and other local politicians are keen to show voters that they are actively addressing their concerns . 
It is doubtful that the [LOC Hamburg  ] government will change their view of Scientology in the future even though officials openly and cordially discuss with ConGen representatives USG policy on religious freedom . 
Nevertheless , the ban proposal may move to the back burner once elections have passed , leaving Scientology [LOC Hamburg  ] and [ORG AGS  ] to deal with their regular concerns . 
END COMMENT. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 .
