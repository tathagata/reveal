( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Summary: The UK  ] government is getting tough on compensation for bankers . 
On January 1 , a code of practice for compensation requiring large firms to report in detail their company’s policies will come into effect . 
UK-based [LOC U.S.  ] firms joined [MISC British  ] banks in signing this code of conduct , but some said they felt coerced to sign . 
Despite HMG actions to rein in bonuses , the [ORG Conservative Party  ] has argued that more needs to be done . 
[LOC UK  ] government officials also are debating whether there should be a return to “narrow banking , ” with [ORG Bank of England  ] Governor [PER Mervyn King  ] advocating a break-up of large banks so that taxpayers do not have to bail-out banks involved in risky trading activities in the future . 
Chancellor of the Exchequer [PER Alistair Darling  ] has rejected such a proposal . 
End Summary . 
[ORG FSA  ] Serious on [ORG Bank Bonuses  ] , [ORG Enforces Voluntary Code  ] -------------------------- ------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) In August , the [ORG Financial Services Authority  ] ( [ORG FSA  ] ) published a code of practice on bank compensation requiring [LOC UK  ] banks and building societies with capital resources exceeding GBP one billion to establish compensation policies consistent with effective risk management and long-term performance . 
The [ORG FSA  ] code defines what constitutes effective pay policy . 
The 26 largest [MISC British  ] banks were given a deadline of November 2 to report to the [ORG FSA  ] the total amount and structure of bonuses they plan to give out in 2009 . 
( Their plans will be reported septel as/if made public . 
) The regulator will also require banks to disclose individual compensation arrangements that fall outside the code and set out plans to bring these aspects into line before next year . 
The code will officially take effect from January 1 , 2010. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Building on the [ORG Financial Stability Board’s  ] recommendations to the [MISC G-20  ] in [LOC Pittsburgh  ] , the [LOC UK  ] code specifically states it is good practice for a significant proportion of any bonus - at least two-thirds - to be deferred over three years . 
It also says guaranteed multi-year bonuses that are not based on performance during the period under review are likely to be inconsistent with effective risk management . 
While the code is written as a series of recommendations , non-compliant firms could face enforcement action or be forced to hold additional capital. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) While the [ORG European Union  ] has proposed implementation of compensation policies by the end of 2010 , the [ORG FSA  ] said it is likely the [LOC UK  ] and possibly one or two other countries will implement a compensation code at least a year ahead of this . 
However , the [ORG FSA  ] noted that practices can be modified based on what comes out of discussions in the [ORG EU  ] and the [ORG Basel Committee  ] on Banking Supervision . 
[ Note: A target date for the implementation of an agreement in [LOC Basel  ] has not yet been set . 
] Political Parties Put Bonuses on [ORG Center Stage  ] ----------------------- --------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Political leaders have taken tough stances on bonuses . 
Chancellor [PER Darling  ] specifically criticized bonuses at [ORG Goldman Sachs  ] and other firms as excessive , saying no bank would be standing if it had not been for taxpayer-funded bailouts . 
[ORG HM Treasury  ] considered a “windfall tax” on bank profits , though recognized this would not help banks increase capital holdings . 
Shadow Chancellor [PER Osborne  ] on October 26 called on the [ORG FSA  ] and [ORG HM Treasury  ] to join together to prevent retail banks and their investment banking arms from paying out significant cash bonuses . 
He advocated bonuses be paid only in company shares , and he said cash that would have been used to pay bonuses should be added to bank balance sheets and used to increase lending . 
[PER Osborne  ] , who previously called for handling the bonus issue internationally to avoid putting the [LOC UK  ] at a competitive disadvantage , noted that the [LOC UK  ] would be acting in concert with the [LOC U.S.  ] and its recent bonus policy announcements . 
Global Banks - Not Pleased --------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) During an October 14 meeting , [ORG Financial Services Minister  ] [PER Lord Myners  ] secured commitments from eight international banks with subsidiaries in the [LOC UK  ] ( [ORG Bank of America Merrill Lynch  ] , [ORG Citigroup  ] , [ORG Credit Suisse  ] , [ORG Goldman Sachs  ] , [ORG JP Morgan  ] , [ORG Morgan Stanley  ] , [ORG Nomura  ] and [ORG UBS  ] ) to adhere to the [ORG FSA  ] code . 
Newspapers reported that banks had been bullied into signing the agreement , a sentiment that was privately expressed to us as well by several [LOC U.S.  ] bankers . 
Representatives of [ORG JP Morgan Chase  ] told us while [ORG JPMC  ] has signed on to [MISC G-20  ] and the [LOC UK  ] [ORG FSA  ] code , the details are what is important . 
Prior to the meeting with [PER Lord Myners  ] , [ORG JPMC  ] and other firms understood from the [ORG Financial Services Authority  ] that they were being asked to sign on to changes effective 2010 . 
Only at the meeting with [PER Lord Myners  ] were they told the [ORG FSA  ] rules would also apply to all 2009 bonuses . 
[ORG JPMC  ] signed on , believing it did not have another choice . 
[ORG Citigroup  ] and [ORG Goldman Sachs  ] officials echoed [LOC LONDON  ] 00002478 002.3 OF 003 this view . 
However , [PER Citi  ] expected [LOC U.S.  ] regulations on pay could be more onerous than [LOC UK  ] regulations and commented that [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC UK  ] regulators would need to harmonize approaches. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG British Bankers’ Association  ] ( [ORG BBA  ] ) has supported the general principle of aligning compensation with risk management , but also cautioned that compensation policies must be harmonized globally so as not to disadvantage [LOC UK  ] firms . 
When the [ORG FSA  ] was consulting on the code , other firms pointed out that the cost of rewriting contracts to comply with the code , would disadvantage the [LOC UK  ] . 
Firms also felt the guidelines were too prescriptive . 
In conversations with us , [ORG JPMC  ] and [ORG Goldman  ] representatives strongly defended their longstanding compensation policies and said the [LOC UK  ] regulations would not mean big changes in how they structure compensation . 
Both said they have consistently used stock options , deferred bonuses , claw back provisions and other policies to tie performance to long-term growth and risk assessment . 
A New [MISC Glass-Steagall  ] ? 
Views on Breaking Up “Casino” Banks ------------------------------- ------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) Public anger over bonuses has sparked debate on how banks can be restructured to ensure taxpayer money is not spent implicitly guaranteeing risky activities . 
Anger has deepened since many of the most profitable banks have seen profits in their investment banking activities , while credit to household and business consumers remains weak. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) In an October 20 speech , [ORG Bank of England  ] Governor [PER Mervyn King  ] called for a “serious review” of how the banking industry is structured and regulated . 
He said [ORG HMG  ] and regulators will need to confront the “too important to fail” question , and he advocated separating the utility functions of banks , namely deposit taking and payment systems , from riskier ventures - dubbed “casino” banking - such as proprietary trading . 
He said the belief that appropriate regulation could ensure speculative activities do not result in failures is a delusion. “We all have a common interest” , he argued , in ensuring continuity of service in the utility aspects of banking but taxpayers should not have to bail-out banks involved in risky trading activities. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) King’s comments were in direct contradiction of HMT’s positions . 
In response to the [ORG Governor’s  ] speech , Chancellor [PER Darling  ] said the problems facing the banking sector were “more complex” than [PER King  ] suggested and added: “I don’t think a [MISC Glass-Steagall  ] approach , which might have been right in the 1930s , is right for the 21st century.” King’s comments were also at odds with the [ORG FSA  ] . 
In his spring report , [PER Lord Turner  ] , Chairman of the [ORG FSA  ] , said he did not see a need for a strict , legal separation . 
He said such a separation would not be practical in today’s complex global economy , nor is it clear it would radically reduce banking system risks . 
Rather , [PER Turner  ] , at the [MISC FSA’s November  ] 2 conference on financial market regulation stated that devising and enforcing appropriate risk management would be a better approach to protecting the public interest than reverting to a new form of [MISC Glass-Steagall  ] legal separation. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) [PER John McFall  ] , Chairman of the [ORG House of Commons’ Treasury Select Committee  ] , has consistently argued for a re-introduction of Glass-Steagall-type legislation . 
While the [MISC Committee’s  ] official July report into the banking crisis did not directly call for a legal separation , it said [ORG HMG  ] should not rule out a ban on proprietary trading in retail banks . 
Several [MISC British  ] academics also have advocated “narrow banking” options . 
Professor [PER John Kay  ] , a prominent [MISC British  ] economist , for example , has argued that it was unacceptable that [ORG HMG  ] had to provide taxpayer funds to protect depositors in banks where problems were created by risky trading activities . 
He proposed a division between narrow banks focused solely on retail deposit taking and payment services and all other financial activities ( which could then be deregulated ) . 
Shadow Chancellor [PER George Osborne  ] has described King’s comments as “powerful and persuasive” but stopped short of directly endorsing legal separation. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Introducing legislation to legally separate banks would be a retrograde step , according to an official at the [ORG British Bankers’ Association  ] . 
He told us there is no traction behind King’s argument . 
No other country is having a serious debate about the re-introduction of Glass-Steagall-type legislation . 
Instead , he said , countries are focusing on creating a banking model in which risk is better addressed through capital and liquidity requirements and better planning for resolving insolvent institutions . 
He said this is what the [ORG FSA  ] is currently doing . 
The [LOC UK  ] needs a sensible debate around these issues , he argued , instead of looking at legislation that artificially separates banks . 
In a press release following [PER Mervyn King’s  ] October 20 speech , the BBA’s chief executive , [PER Angela Knight  ] , said the [MISC UK’s  ] current mixed banking model [LOC LONDON  ] 00002478 003.3 OF 003 provides choice . 
She said big businesses may want big banks that offer a range of products and services while individuals may want something smaller . 
She argued there is a “clear and unambiguous” requirement for universal banks. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Conclusion: With major banks expected to announce their bonuses in the upcoming weeks , the [LOC UK  ] government as well as the opposition parties will continue to seek ways to redress the worst abuses . 
The debate will spill over into the electoral campaign , as [ORG Labour  ] and the [MISC Conservatives  ] jockey to capitalize on public anger to promise reforms and an end to business as usual . 
While separating commercial from investment banking will remain attractive to some as a way to prevent recurrence of many of the worst abuses of the past decade , it is highly unlikely that the [LOC UK  ] would go alone on this , as [LOC UK  ] authorities are keenly focused on maintaining London’s role as a leading global financial center . 
On bonuses , the [LOC UK  ] will want to ensure that its approach remains consistent with that of its [ORG EU  ] partners and the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC SUSMAN</pre></code>  ]
