( C ) SUMMARY . 
[MISC German  ] MFA A/S equivalent for [ORG Non Proliferation and Disarmament Gottwald  ] told [ORG House Foreign Affairs Committee  ] Staff Director [PER Richard Kessler  ] that [LOC Germany  ] was ready to support sanctions on [LOC Iran  ] , especially ones which target the leadership and minimize impact on the general population . 
[LOC Germany  ] would prefer to see action taken within the [ORG UNSC  ] , but is concerned about [MISC Chinese  ] commitment . 
[LOC Iran  ] [ORG Task Force  ] Director [PER Krueger  ] said [LOC Germany  ] was looking at measures in sectors involving transportation ( [ORG Air Iran  ] and shipping ) , banking , [ORG Liquefied Natural Gas  ] ( [ORG LNG  ] ) and [ORG Compressed Natural Gas  ] ( [ORG CNG  ] ) , as well as exploring ways to target the [ORG IRGC  ] leaders . 
[ORG NEA  ] Iran/Maghreb [ORG DAS  ] equivalent [PER Ralph Tarraf  ] said [LOC Germany  ] was also exploring ways to bring [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Human Rights  ] violations before the [ORG UN  ] offices in [LOC Geneva  ] . 
[PER Tarraf  ] also advocated taking [MISC Turkish  ] initiatives on [LOC Iran  ] seriously while not publicly endorsing them . 
Experts from [LOC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] advocated for a ban on weapons sales to [LOC Iran  ] , covert sabotage of the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear program , and focusing efforts to find a negotiated solution more directly in the office of the Supreme Leader . 
End Summary. ---------------------------------------- IMPORTANCE OF [ORG UNSCR  ] ; CONCERN ABOUT [LOC CHINA  ] ---------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Gottwald  ] summarized the [MISC German  ] position on [LOC Iran  ] Sanctions emphasizing the importance of getting a new [ORG UNSCR  ] passed sooner rather than later during a January 6 meeting . 
He noted it would be difficult , but important , to keep [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC China  ] on board . 
He said no one is enthusiastic about sanctions , but all agree that [MISC Iranian  ] refusals to reach an agreement must carry a price . 
He quoted Chancellor Merkel’s speech to [ORG Congress  ] in November and said [LOC Germany  ] had “zero tolerance” for a nuclear armed [LOC Iran  ] and was ready to support sanctions . 
He expressed greater concern over the [MISC Chinese  ] commitment to sanctions than [MISC Russian  ] . 
Putting the current [LOC Iran  ] discussion into a broader context [PER Gottwald  ] worried that [LOC Iran  ] could become a spoiler in the upcoming [LOC NPT RevCon.  ] ---------------------------------------- GOAL OF SANCTIONS: HIT LEADERS NOT PEOPLE ----------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) When asked by [PER Kessler  ] what [LOC Germany  ] would like to see in a [ORG UNSCR  ] or [ORG EU  ] measures on [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Gottwald  ] and MFA Deputy A/S equivalent for [ORG Trade and Export Control Lingemann  ] remained vague in their answers . 
[PER Gottwald  ] said the [ORG EU  ] could be counted on to take its guidance from the next [ORG UNSCR  ] on [LOC Iran  ] and enact measures to enforce and strengthen the [ORG UNSCR  ] . 
In particular he expected the [ORG EU  ] to take action to target specific leaders with visa bans and perhaps other measures . 
[PER Gottwald  ] said [LOC Germany  ] would like to see measures have a direct effect on [MISC Iranian  ] leaders , and to minimize the effect on the population . 
[PER Gottwald  ] called petrol sanctions a “mixed blessing” noting that they give the government an excuse to cut subsidies which puts the burden onto the general population and money back in government budgets . 
[PER Lingemann  ] said denying access to certain exploration/extraction technology could be an effective tactic since it would more directly impact the government’s pocketbook and ability to “buy friends” abroad . 
He stressed that we need measures that do not generate a commiseration effect from other countries . 
[PER Lingemann  ] noted that while a broad [ORG UNSCR  ] was preferable , there were still some technological areas ( such as CNG/LNG related technologies ) in which [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG EU  ] companies have a monopoly on the market and where [MISC Russian  ] and [MISC Chinese  ] companies can’t compete should [ORG EU  ] wide measures be needed . 
He also said that targeted measures that impact Iran’s refining capabilities can be effective as they have an immediate impact on the government’s income. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG Iran Task Force  ] Director [PER Krueger  ] , in a separate meeting , specifically mentioned transportation ( [ORG Iran Air  ] and shipping ) , banking , and LNG/CNG sectors as areas on which [LOC Germany  ] was looking to focus [ORG UNSC  ] or [ORG EU  ] action . 
He said [LOC Germany  ] was also interested in targeting the [ORG IRGC  ] but was still wrestling with how to best do so . 
He noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] had based its justification on the [MISC IRGC’s  ] terrorist associations with [ORG Hezballah  ] , but since [ORG Hezballah  ] is not recognized as a terrorist organization in [LOC Europe  ] that wouldn’t work . 
He said his colleagues were looking at possible action against the [ORG IRGC  ] for violations of [ORG Human Rights  ] and thought that might be more workable in the [MISC European  ] context , but they were open to suggestions . 
[LOC BERLIN  ] 00000081 002 OF 003 ------------------------------------------ EXPLORING WHAT TO DO ON [ORG HUMAN RIGHTS FRONT  ] ------------------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG NEA  ] Iran/Magreb [ORG DAS  ] equivalent [PER Ralph Tarraf  ] noted that [LOC Germany  ] was looking at whether and how to bring the [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Human Rights  ] violations before the [ORG UN  ] offices in [LOC Geneva  ] . 
He said it was important to make clear to the [MISC Iranian  ] government that we are concerned about their human rights violations and that the concern is not purely a “Western” phenomena but rather a global one . 
He said February 15 is a key date as that is when the [LOC Iran  ] country review process will take place in [LOC Geneva  ] . 
He added that [LOC Germany  ] is discussing listing the [ORG IRGC  ] both under the non-proliferation regime and now also for its human rights violations . 
He noted that it was important to keep the two separate sanctions tracks separate and not to confuse the proliferation and human rights issues. --------------------------------------------- --- CAN ENGAGEMENT WORK ? 
IS THERE A ROLE FOR [LOC TURKEY  ] ? --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) On the issue of whether continued engagement with the [MISC Iranian  ] government undermines the opposition , [PER Gottwald  ] stressed that it is important that engagement not be construed to “favor” [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , but rather we should continue , as we have , on a purely “logical” basis . 
He said he was concerned that the current [MISC Iranian  ] government may be incapable of coming to any conclusions , but that doesn’t mean we should let up on our pressure . 
[PER Tarraf  ] said we face the “worst situation possible” with a weak regime that is not yet close to regime change . 
He suggested we focus on new forms of access to the regime which would allow for discrete talks to continue at a high-level . 
[PER Gottwald  ] added that he thought it was important to look for other mechanisms such as the [ORG TRR  ] proposal which can serve as disincentives to continue down the nuclearization path. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Tarraf  ] said he saw increased [MISC Saudi/Iranian  ] rivalry in the [LOC Gulf  ] region and suggested the [MISC West  ] avoid putting all its “eggs in one basket” behind the [MISC Saudis  ] . 
He suggested looking for other allies in the region who can be constructive such as [LOC Turkey  ] . 
He admitted that [LOC Turkey  ] had abstained in the [ORG IAEA  ] and expressed reluctance on sanctions , but these positions also afforded them greater leverage with the [MISC Iranians  ] . 
He suggested we consider taking [MISC Turkish  ] initiatives seriously without publicly endorsing them . 
He agreed that to date [MISC Turkish  ] promises - on Syria/Israel and Iran- have not yielded any results , but he advocated giving [LOC Turkey  ] a quiet nod of approval to see if they can deliver. ------------------------------------------- ARMS BAN , SABOTAGE , FOCUS ON SUPREME LEADER ------------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] argued that the only effective sanctions which could positively impact the regime’s security calculations on the nuclear dossier would be a ban on sales of conventional arms . 
Only such a move could shift the security calculation for the regime from the longer term goal of achieving nuclear capability to the shorter term goal of maintaining a conventional capability . 
He warned that ineffective sanctions could be worse than no sanctions , especially if they send more money to the [MISC IRGC’s  ] pockets ( through increasing necessity of procurement on the black market which is dominated by the [ORG IRGC  ] . 
) In the interim [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] recommended that a policy of covert sabotage ( unexplained explosions , accidents , computer hacking etc ) would be more effective than a military strike whose effects in the region could be devastating. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] offered some insights into the inner workings of the regime and postured that the [ORG TRR  ] deal had failed because the Supreme Leader ( [ORG SL  ] ) hadn’t committed himself to the deal 100 percent . 
He said any deal would have to have the full blessing of the [ORG SL  ] and said that once negotiations in the SL’s office ( or with his closest confidants ) began , success would be guaranteed since the [ORG SL  ] - by definition- never fails . 
He noted that the [ORG SL  ] has his representatives at every level of government , but some have greater access to him than others . 
The three with greatest access , according to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , at the moment are his son [PER Mojtaba  ] , [PER Ayatollah Golpaygani  ] and [ORG Hejazi  ] .
