RICCIARDONE  ] FOR REASONS 1.4 ( B ) AND ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) SUMMARY: On numerous occasions we have emphasized with Attorney General [PER Aloko  ] the need to end interventions by him and President [PER Karzai  ] , who both authorize the release of detainees pre-trial and allow dangerous individuals to go free or re-enter the battlefield without ever facing an [MISC Afghan  ] court . 
On July 29th , Legal Adviser [PER Harold Hongju Koh  ] and Deputy Ambassador [PER Frances Ricciardone  ] demarched Attorney General Muhammad [PER Ishaq Aloko  ] about our concern over pre-trial releases and presidential pardons of narco-traffickers ( Reftel [LOC Kabul  ] 02245 ) In Spring 2008 , Post had previous demarched [ORG National Security Advisor Rassoul  ] about our concern over pre-trial releases . 
Despite our complaints and expressions of concern to the [ORG GIRoA  ] , pre-trial releases continue . 
END SUMMARY <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Transfers from [ORG Bagram Theatre Internment Facility  ] ( [ORG BTIF  ] ) to the [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG National Detention Facility  ] ( [ORG ANDF  ] ) began in Spring 2007 . 
During that year , there was only one pre-trial release . 
In 2008 , there were 104 pre-trial releases , almost all of which took place after President [PER Karzai  ] formed the [ORG Aloko Detainee Commission  ] in April 2008 . 
From January to March of 2009 , there were 12 pre-trial releases ; and 23 pre-trial releases between April and June <a id='par2009' href='#par2009'>¶</a>2009 . 
So far in July 2009 , there have been 10 pre-trial releases. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) An August 2005 exchange of diplomatic notes between the [ORG USG  ] and the [ORG GIRoA  ] provides the legal basis for the [ORG GIRoA  ] , s detention and prosecution of detainees transferred into [MISC Afghan  ] custody . 
Even though a multi-agency [ORG GIRoA  ] delegation under the [ORG Aloko Detainee Commission  ] screens all [ORG BTIF  ] detainees who are transferred to the [ORG ANDF  ] and assures the [ORG USG  ] that these detainees will be prosecuted in an [MISC Afghan  ] court , there have been 150 detainees released from the [ORG ANDF  ] without trial since 2007 , including 29 former [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] ( [LOC GTMO  ] ) detainees . 
The total number of transfers to date from [ORG BTIF  ] to [ORG ANDF  ] is 629 detainees , plus 41 from [LOC GTMO.  ] ------------------------------- PROTECTION OF NARCOTRAFFICKERS ------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC SBU  ] ) In April , President [PER Karzai  ] pardoned five border policemen who were caught with 124 kilograms of heroin in their border police vehicle . 
The policemen , who have come to be known as the [PER Zahir Five  ] , , were tried , convicted and sentenced to terms of 16 to 18 years each at the [ORG Central Narcotics Tribunal  ] . 
But President [PER Karzai  ] pardoned all five of them on the grounds that they were distantly related to two individuals who had been martyred during the civil war. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Separately , President [PER Karzai  ] tampered with the narcotics case of [PER Haji Amanullah  ] , whose father is a wealthy businessman and one of his supporters . 
Without any constitutional authority , [PER Karzai  ] ordered the police to conduct a second investigation which resulted in the conclusion that the defendant had been framed . 
XXXXXXXXXXXXX told [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] he was ashamed , , of the president for his interference in this case and the case of the [PER Zahir Five.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In another case , a CJTF investigation concluded that 26 kilograms of heroin seized from a vehicle search belonged to [LOC Col.  ] Jaweed , Chief of the [ORG Highway Police  ] for [ORG Badakshan Province  ] . 
Jaweed is the nephew of a powerful member of Parliament . 
Eventually , he was arrested and is currently serving in [LOC Pol-i-Charkhi  ] prison . 
But , there is credible , but unconfirmed , intelligence indicating that President [PER Karzai  ] has signed a letter pardoning Jaweed that has not yet been delivered to the [ORG Supreme Court  ] . 
[PER Daudzai  ] denied any significant pressure in this case. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Unconfirmed intelligence also indicates that President [PER Karzai  ] is planning to release drug trafficker [PER Ismal Safed  ] , who is serving a 19-year sentence in [LOC Pol-i-Charkhi  ] . 
[PER Safed  ] is a priority [ORG DEA  ] target who was arrested in 2005 in possession of large quantities of heroin and a cache of weapons . 
In 2008 , [ORG DEA  ] conducted an operation in which an undercover officer purchased approximately three kilograms of heroin directly from [PER Safed  ] . 
[PER Daudzai  ] told the Deputy Ambassador that President [PER Karzai  ] will not pardon [PER Safed  ] , and that Post , s concerns about this case will reaffirm President [PER Karzai  ] , s decision not to interfere .
