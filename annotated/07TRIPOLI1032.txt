CLOSING THE EASTERN BORDER TO NON-EGYPTIAN IMPORTS 2 . 
( C ) [MISC Libyan  ] businessman xxxxxxxxxxxx ( protect ) told Pol/Econ Chief November 6 that the [ORG GOL  ] adopted new rules in early October to prevent importation of goods of non-Egyptian manufacture across the [MISC Egyptian-Libyan  ] land border . 
Only products manufactured in [LOC Egypt  ] may be imported overland from [LOC Egypt  ] to [LOC Libya  ] ; products manufactured elsewhere that had previously been trans-shipped via [LOC Egypt  ] to [LOC Libya  ] were no longer permitted . 
( Note: xxxxxxxxxxxx is the senior sibling of a family-owned holding company whose varied commercial interests include import/export and distribution under license of foreign-manufactured products . 
End note . 
) xxxxxxxxxxxx complained that the new strictures , which were implemented without advance warning to businesses using the overland route , had seriously disrupted imports of consumer goods , contributing to shortages of some items during the several weeks it took companies to adjust their import and distribution networks . 
[LOC EGYPT  ] SURPRISED 3 . 
( C ) [MISC Egyptian  ] [ORG DCM  ] [PER Ayman Musharafa  ] confirmed November 9 that the new strictures were in place . 
Indicating that the [ORG GOL  ] had given [LOC Egypt  ] 's government less than 24-hours notice that the new rules would go into effect , he attributed the measures to the [ORG GOL  ] 's desire to encourage greater use of the [LOC Benghazi  ] port , ostensibly to facilitate better regulation of imports and tariffs on same . 
Conceding that the [MISC Egyptian-Libyan  ] land border is porous , [PER Musharafa  ] said the [ORG GOL  ] had complained for some time that it was unable to better regulate the flow of overland imports . 
Rumors over the summer to the effect that the [ORG GOL  ] would seek to close the [MISC Egyptian-Libyan  ] border to all imported goods had prompted a senior-level demarche by [LOC Egypt  ] to the [ORG GOL  ] protesting the proposal . 
[LOC Egypt  ] 's understanding was that the plan , to include bans on non-Egyptian products , had subsequently been dropped altogther ; the October initiative came as a surprise . 
[LOC BENGHAZI  ] PORT THE NEW ENTREPOT 4 . 
( C ) [LOC Benghazi  ] 's port , which both [PER Musharafa  ] and xxxxxxxxxxxx described as " the worst " in [LOC Libya  ] , had recently undergone some physical and administrative refurbishment ( [ORG NFI  ] ) and the [ORG GOL  ] was keen to funnel imports through it . 
Despite the changes and the [ORG GOL  ] 's efforts to encourage its use , the [LOC Benghazi  ] port remains so " chaotic " that some importers have preferred to incur additional expense to route their products through the better-run ports at the [LOC Misrata  ] [MISC Free Trade Zone  ] or [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
USED GAS GUZZLERS PART OF THE PROBLEM ? 5 . 
( C ) [PER Musharafa  ] said the new measures were prompted in part by the [ORG GOL  ] 's desire to better regulate and limit importation of fuel inefficient used vehicles . 
The [ORG GOL  ] discounts car prices as part of the basket of subsidies it provides to [MISC Libyans  ] in exchange for political quiescence . 
Imports and sales of vehicles , many of them used , have increased dramatically in the last 18 months . 
Noting a recent , short-term gasoline shortage occasioned by delayed delivery of two tankerloads of gasoline ( details septel ) , [PER Musharafa  ] said the [ORG GOL  ] had belatedly realized that its gasoline import and distribution networks weren't sufficient to supply the newly enlarged fleet of [MISC Libyan  ] cars . 
[LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00001032 002 OF 002 The [ORG GOL  ] was particularly concerned about importation of used vehicles , many of which were purchased in bulk in [LOC Europe  ] and shipped overland through [LOC Turkey  ] , [LOC Syria  ] , [LOC Jordan  ] and [LOC Egypt  ] to [LOC Libya  ] . 
The [ORG GOL  ] is reportedly also keen to limit imports of used vehicles from [LOC Tunisia  ] . 
6 . 
( C ) The relative porosity of land border crossings , together with less-developed customs and immigration systems at land border checkpoints , made it more difficult to police them . 
The move to encourage greater use of its ports was part of a broader [ORG GOL  ] effort to better manage imports. xxxxxxxxxxxx noted that funneling imports through the ports also limited the ability of individual border guards to solicit bribes , but potentially made it easier for more senior officials involved in port administration to do so . 
He indicated that corruption remained a greater problem at [LOC Benghazi  ] than at [LOC Misrata  ] or [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
7 . 
( C ) Comment: xxxxxxxxxxxx was scathing in his criticism of the [ORG GOL  ] 's ill-considered and poorly implemented decision , citing it as a sign of what he characterized as a lack of commitment to and clarity about economic reform among senior [ORG GOL  ] leaders . 
The measure highlights a continuing feature of the landscape here: the disconnect between senior-level rhetoric about the need for and commitment to economic reform and a series of decisions -- requiring [MISC Arabic-language  ] translations of foreign passport biodata pages , increasingly stringent requirements that foreign companies employ [MISC Libyans  ] who may or may not be qualified -- that hinder business at the practical level .
