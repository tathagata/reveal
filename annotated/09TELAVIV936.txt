End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) CODEL [PER Kyl  ] , consisting of Senator [PER Jon Kyl  ] ( R , [LOC AZ  ] ) ; Senator [PER Jeff Sessions  ] ( R , [LOC AL  ] ) ; Representative [PER Jane Harman  ] ( D , [LOC CA  ] ) ; Representative [PER John Kline  ] ( R , [LOC MN  ] ) ; and Representative [PER Chris Carney  ] ( D , [ORG PA  ] ) , called on Prime Minister [PER Benyamin  ] [ORG Netanyahu April  ] 6 . 
The Ambassador , [ORG Congressional  ] staff , and [PER Pol Couns  ] ( notetaker ) participated in the meeting . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] was joined by [ORG National Security Adviser  ] [PER Uzi Arad  ] , Spokesman [PER Mark Regev  ] , Policy Adviser [PER Ron Dermer  ] , former chairman of the [ORG Knesset  ] 's [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] and [ORG Defense Committee  ] Kadima [ORG MK  ] [PER Tzachi Hanegbi  ] ( Senator 's [PER Kyl  ] 's counterpart in the [MISC U.S.-Israel Joint Parliamentary Committee  ] on [ORG National Security  ] ) , and the [MISC Israeli  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Washington  ] 's [ORG Congressional  ] liaison officer . 
The meeting was the first official [LOC U.S.  ] face to face contact with [PER Netanyahu  ] since he formed his government . 
What Will the [LOC U.S.  ] Do About [LOC Iran  ] ? --------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) After a brief discussion of the world economic crisis , Senator [PER Kyl  ] raised [LOC Iran  ] , noting the " sobering " briefings the [ORG CODEL  ] had received from senior [MISC Israeli  ] defense and intelligence officials the previous day . 
[PER Kyl  ] said the [ORG Congress  ] is looking at legislation that would target [LOC Iran  ] 's imports of refined petroleum products , adding that there are only four or five companies that supply refined petroleum to [LOC Iran  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] has considerable leverage over most of them . 
[PER Kyl  ] added that [MISC Israeli  ] experts had told the [ORG CODEL  ] that they thought such legislation would be helpful . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] said nothing is slowing the progress of [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program . 
The Prime Minister asked what will happen to the [LOC Middle East  ] if [LOC Iran  ] obtains a nuclear weapon ? 
If such a prospect is unacceptable , what will the [LOC U.S.  ] do as [LOC Iran  ] reaches the nuclear threshold ? 
What will the [LOC U.S.  ] do if [LOC Pakistan  ] is taken over by [MISC Islamic  ] radicals ? <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Representative [PER Harman  ] told [PER Netanyahu  ] that no one in the [ORG CODEL  ] disagreed with his analysis , but the [LOC U.S.  ] should give engagement an opportunity to see if it works . 
If it does not , at least it would show the world that the [LOC U.S.  ] had tried . 
She added that [ORG Congress  ] supports engagement on a bipartisan basis . 
Senator [PER Kyl  ] added that the [MISC Europeans  ] tried to engage [LOC Iran  ] for five years but it did not work . 
President [PER Obama  ] will pursue engagement , but [PER Kyl  ] said he doubted it would be successful . 
We should consider what to do in the mean time . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] responded that the [LOC U.S.  ] should move quickly . 
Engagement should have a short time limit and a specific goal , for example talk to the [MISC Iranians  ] for four to twelve weeks and make clear that the [LOC U.S.  ] goal is an end to their nuclear program . 
Leaning forward , [PER Netanyahu  ] repeated his earlier question: " What will you do if it does not work ? 
" [ORG TEL AVIV  ] 00000936 002 OF 003 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Netanyahu  ] said that learning to live with a nuclear [LOC Iran  ] would be a big mistake which would lead to a different , more dangerous world . 
While he noted that he could not say for certain that [LOC Iran  ] would use a nuclear weapon against [LOC Israel  ] , if [LOC Iran  ] had a bomb [MISC Israelis  ] would have to ask that question every day . 
This is a historic moment , and leaders have a responsibility to make decisions . 
All other issues are insignificant by comparison . 
For a third time , [PER Netanyahu  ] asked , " What are you going to do ? 
" [PER Netanyahu  ] 's Approach to the [MISC Palestinians  ] ---------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Senator Kyl asked the Prime Minister about his view of the two-state solution . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] said he plans to engage the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] quickly and will not tie political talks with the [MISC Palestinians  ] to developments with [LOC Iran  ] . 
Reviewing a now familiar formula , [PER Netanyahu  ] said he will approach the [MISC Palestinians  ] on parallel political , economic and security tracks . 
Political talks would aim at achieving an agreement within certain limits , the economic approach would promote foreign and [MISC Arab  ] investment and joint projects with [MISC Israeli  ] partners , while the security track would continue to build up the [ORG PA  ] 's security forces . 
In order to do any of this , [PER Netanyahu  ] noted , he will need a [MISC Palestinian  ] partner. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Representative [PER Harman  ] observed that the [ORG CODEL  ] had visited units of the [ORG PA  ] 's [ORG National Security Forces  ] and the [ORG Presidential Guard  ] . 
[ORG PA  ] Prime Minister [PER Fayyad  ] said he was happy with the [ORG PA  ] 's security forces , and they want to take on increased responsibility for security in [LOC Jericho  ] and [LOC Jenin  ] . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] replied that [LOC Israel  ] would be happy to let them do more , but it is not clear what [ORG Hamas  ] will do next . 
If [ORG Hamas  ] forces a confrontation , [LOC Israel  ] will have to initiate further military action in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
[LOC Israel  ] did not want to go back into [LOC Gaza  ] , but it will do what is necessary to protect its people. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Netanyahu  ] said his government is reviewing [LOC Israel  ] 's policy toward the [MISC Palestinians  ] . 
There is a consensus in the government and among 80% of the [MISC Israeli  ] public that the [MISC Palestinians  ] should be able to govern themselves . 
The only limits on [MISC Palestinian  ] sovereignty would be elements that affect [LOC Israel  ] 's security . 
A [MISC Palestinian  ] state must be demilitarized , without control over its air space and electro-magnetic field , and without the power to enter into treaties or control its borders . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] concluded that he and opposition leader [PER Tzipi Livni  ] " only disagree about the name , " i.e. the two-state solution. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Senator Sessions noted that people everywhere want law and order . 
[MISC Palestinians  ] not only need to deal with terrorism , they also need a functioning legal system . 
Moving from a lawless system , the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] is showing some pride , but police are not enough , they need courts and jails that work . 
Economic development is impossible in a lawless society . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] agreed this was a valid point and uncharacteristically admitted that he had not focused much on [MISC Palestinian  ] governance . 
He added that international assistance should provide funding for jails and courts . 
It is possible to create crime-free zones and begin economic development " in bubbles " which would then be expanded . 
Senator Sessions noted that Lt. General [LOC Dayton  ] is focused on this issue . 
Representative [PER Harman  ] commented that " bubbles " in the [LOC West Bank  ] would not be enough , [MISC Palestinians  ] need law and order everywhere. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Netanyahu  ] said the " classic rhetoric " of the peace process has been that if [LOC Israel  ] withdraws , all will be well . 
Now , however , if [LOC Israel  ] withdrew from the [LOC West Bank  ] , [ORG Hamas  ] would take over . 
Economic development would not be a substitute for a political settlement , but it would change the environment and show [MISC Palestinians  ] the benefits of peace . 
[LOC Israel  ] has been trying to " build a roof without a foundation " and it has not worked . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] said there was one proviso: If [LOC Iran  ] gets a nuke , peace efforts will fail. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Netanyahu  ] pointed to the example of [MISC Jordanian  ] [PER King Hussein  ] , whom he termed [LOC Israel  ] 's best [MISC Arab  ] ally and a man deeply committed to peace . 
Yet when [PER Saddam Hussein  ] took [LOC Kuwait  ] , [PER King Hussein  ] got on board with the [MISC Iraqis  ] . 
In the event of a nuclear [LOC Iran  ] , " all the [MISC Arabs  ] will become [LOC Qatar  ] . 
" We should therefore move in parallel to work for peace with the [MISC Palestinians  ] while acting to stop [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] said he thought his government would pleasantly surprise many of its critics . 
He concluded the meeting by saying that he wants to coordinate [LOC Israel  ] 's positions with the [LOC U.S.  ] and hopes to come to a common position with President [PER Obama  ] .
