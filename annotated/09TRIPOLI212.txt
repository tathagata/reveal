REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) [ORG Summary: The General People 's Congress  ] - [LOC Libya  ] 's version of a national parliament - ended its annual week-long session in Sirte March 5 , approving a cabinet reshuffle that placed intelligence chief [PER Musa Kusa  ] at the helm of the foreign ministry and postponing [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] 's controversial proposal to disband government ministries and distribute the country 's oil wealth directly to the people . 
Instead , the [ORG GPC  ] consolidated some ministry-equivalents while committing wealth redistribution and economic reform to " further study " . 
The [ORG GPC  ] approved a national budget of USD 39 billion , a 30-percent increase over last year 's budget . 
[MISC Italian  ] Prime Minister [PER Silvio Burlesconi  ] was on hand to witness the ratification of a " friendship and cooperation " treaty that requires the [MISC Italian  ] government to subsidize $5 billion for infrastructure projects in [LOC Libya  ] as reparations- for the 30-year [MISC Italian  ] occupation of [LOC Libya  ] . 
Delegates did not discuss a draft constitution , which [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] 's son [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi has championed . 
The cabinet shuffle ousted some reform-minded luminaries from their position , retained other advocates of rational planning , but left the once-imperiled Prime Minister-equivalent al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi in place , suggesting that reforms will come more slowly than once thought . 
However , as the September 1 anniversary marking the 40th year since the coup that brought al-Qadhafi to power draws closer and [MISC Libyans  ] hold positions of international import , the leader has several opportunities to make surprise changes of direction . 
End Summary . 
SAME FACES , FEWER CHAIRS: CONGRESS GIVES CABINET LINEUP 2 . 
( [LOC S//NF  ] ) The annual session of the [ORG General People 's Congress  ] - the top level of the multi-tiered [LOC Jamahiriya  ] direct democracy scheme ( ref A ) - wrapped up on March 5 leading to a major cabinet shuffle and a reorganization of some of the [ORG General People 's Committees  ] ( Ministry-equivalents ) . 
The biggest change came at the [ORG General People 's Committee  ] for Foreign Liaison and [ORG International Cooperation  ] ( [ORG MFA-equivalent  ] ) with former head [PER Abudlrahman Shalgam  ] stepping down to take the [MISC PermRep  ] spot at the [ORG UN  ] and [ORG External Security Organization  ] ( [ORG ESO  ] ; CIA-equivalent ) [PER Musa Kusa  ] stepping in to fill the empty FM slot . 
[PER Shalgam  ] is expected in [LOC New York  ] this week to take up the mantle of [MISC UNSC  ] President while [PER Kusa  ] expects to maintain both spy-chief and chief-diplomat roles . 
Despite year-long murmurs that he was due to be sacked ( ref B ) , Prime Minister-equivalent al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi retained his top spot and his former deputy [PER Mohammed Ali  ] al-Hweij was picked for the Secretary of the new [ORG Committee  ] for [ORG Industry , Economy  ] , and [PER Trade  ] formed from the merger the old [ORG Industry and Mining Committee  ] and the [ORG Economy  ] , [PER Trade  ] , and [ORG Investment Committee  ] . 
[PER Ali Essawi  ] , former head of the [ORG Committee  ] for [ORG Economy  ] and [PER Trade  ] was left without a posting - a move the [MISC French  ] embassy claims is related to accusations of corruption . 
( [PER Note: Essawi  ] twice attempted to resign last year over disagreements with al-Mahmoudi but was convinced to stay . 
End Note ) The youth-oriented [ORG Basic Education Committee  ] and the [ORG Higher Education Committee  ] were combined into the [ORG Committee  ] for [ORG Education  ] and [ORG Scientific Research  ] to be chaired by Abdelkabir [PER Mohammed Fakhri  ] while the [ORG Committee  ] for [ORG Youth and Sport  ] was abolished . 
Still , working-level contacts in ministries remained uncertain of what the shake-up meant , with several contacts in the former [ORG Committee  ] for [ORG Culture  ] and Information telling [MISC APAO  ] that they didn't know who they worked for but expect they will be absorbed into [ORG MFA  ] 's existing cultural office - and therefore under the control of [PER Musa Kusa  ] . 
See para 6 for the full list of cabinet positions . 
WEALTH DISTRIBUTION PLAN TO GET " FURTHER STUDY " 3 . 
( C ) In the wake of broad opposition to the ill-defined wealth distribution mechanism proposed by al-Qadhafi ( ref C ) , the [ORG GPC  ] decided to postpone action pending " further study " . 
A January meeting of the [ORG GPC  ] was cancelled to give budget-makers time to revise their figures after the precipitous fall of oil prices and the spread of the global financial crisis gave both technocrats and proponents of the distribution scheme pause ( ref D ) . xxxxxxxxxxxx recently told us he had been asked to sit on a commission charged with hammering out specifics of the reform program . 
The status of a " shadow " committee -organized last year by [PER Saif  ] al-Islam [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000212 002.2 OF 003 al-Qadhafi and featuring [ORG Central Bank  ] governor [PER Farhat Bengadara  ] and [PER Ali Essawi  ] - both of whom voiced opposition to the distribution plan on live television ( ref E ) - its mission to develop practical steps to reform are unknown . 
The [ORG Congress  ] settled on a budget of over 49 billion dinars ( 39.3b USD ) - a 30-percent increase over [ORG FY08  ] . 
Government salaries will make up 9 billion dinars ( 7.2b USD ) , public expenditures another 4.8 billion ( 3.8b USD ) and development projects taking the lion 's share with 21.5 billion dinars ( 17.2b USD ) . 
[LOC ITALY  ] PAYS COMPENSATION FOR COLONIAL WRONGS 4 . 
( C ) [MISC Italian  ] PM [PER Berlusconi  ] was in Sirte on March 2 ( along with the diplomatic corps flown in as well as spectators ) to witness the ratification of the [MISC Italy-Libya  ] " friendship and cooperation " treaty signed last August ( ref F ) , apologize for [LOC Italy  ] 's misdeeds ( leading al-Qadhafi to raise his arms in triumph and glee ) , and to effect the exchange of ratifications . 
While the treaty calls for [LOC Italy  ] to pay $200 million per year for 25 years to absolve it of its colonial wrong-doing , it also guarantees [MISC Italian  ] companies preference for development projects the money will fund . 
[LOC Libya  ] also agreed to implement an earlier agreement aimed at stemming illegal migration through [LOC Libya  ] to [LOC Italy  ] - including joint maritime patrols - but [MISC Italian  ] DCM [PER Lorenzo Kluzer  ] told [ORG Poloff  ] the treaty mirrored [LOC Italy  ] 's interests in the [LOC Jamahiriya  ] , which he ordered as " oil , oil , oil , and migration " . 
According to [PER Kluzer  ] , joint patrols could begin as early as June provided [LOC Libya  ] follows through with implementation - something they have failed to do in previous iterations of migration agreements . 
[PER Berlusconi  ] invited [PER Qadhafi  ] to [LOC Italy  ] , and to the [ORG G-8 Summit  ] in July in [LOC Sardinia  ] . 
He said one of the sessions on the third day would be devoted to [LOC Africa  ] , hence the reason for the invite to [PER Qadhafi  ] , the new Chairman of the [ORG AU Assembly  ] . 
The [MISC Italian  ] PM said the summit would also deal with the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] conflict as well . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] showed unprecedented hospitality for his [MISC Italian  ] guest , being present at both the arrival and departure of [PER Berlusconi  ] . 
WE THE PEOPLE: [MISC LIBYANS  ] SEE NO CHANGE WITHOUT CONSTITUTION 5 . 
( C ) While the reparations and increased spending on development projects sit well with ordinary [MISC Libyans  ] , several news organizations associated with [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi criticized the cabinet shake-up as little more than moving pawns around a chessboard . 
Juma al-Usta from the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Chamber of Commerce  ] was quoted saying " the new cabinet is no different from the previous ones...the same group of people over 40 years now and they are still without a strategy or a plan " . 
A spokesman for [PER Saif  ] al-Islam 's [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] decried the use of " direct appointments " saying that " the new government will not succeed and will not survive six months " , adding that " there is no way to get out of this without a constitution " . 
His view is apparently shared by commenters on opposition website [LOC Libya  ] al-Youm who expected discussion of a draft constitution and were very critical of [PER Musa Kusa  ] becoming both intelligence chief and foreign minister . 
[ORG ESO  ] is targeted by rights groups and opposition leaders as the organization responsible for silencing political opposition to al-Qadhafi 's rule using repressive tactics that violate victims' human rights. xxxxxxxxxxxx shared his view with [LOC Econoff  ] , which seems to mirror popular opinion , " at the end of the day , I don't care about government restructuring - I just want good healthcare in [LOC Libya  ] and a good education for my kids . 
" LIST OF NEW COMMITTEES AND THEIR SECRETARIES 6 . 
( C ) A list of the current committees and their secretaries follows . 
Post maintains biographic information on its SIPRnet website at ( http://www.intelink.sgov.gov/wiki/Category:Li bya_Biography ) , which will be updated in the coming days to reflect the new portfolios: - Secretary of the [ORG General People 's Committee  ] ( [ORG PM-equivalent  ] ) , al-Baghdadi [PER Ali  ] al-Mahmoudi - Secretary of the [ORG General People 's Committee  ] for Health and [ORG Environment  ] , [PER Mohamed Mahmoud  ] al-Hijazi - Secretary of the [ORG General People 's Committee  ] for [ORG Planning  ] and Finance , [PER Abdelhafiz Zlitni  ] - Secretary of the [ORG General People 's Committee  ] for Industry , Economy , and Trade , [PER Mohammed Ali  ] al-Hweij - Secretary of the [ORG General People 's Committee  ] for [ORG Facilities and Resources  ] , Matuq [PER Mohammed Matuq  ] [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000212 003.2 OF 003 - Secretary of the [ORG General People 's Committee  ] for Agriculture , Livestock , and [ORG Marine Life  ] , [PER Abu Bakr Mabrouk  ] al-Mansouri - Secretary of the [ORG General People 's Committee  ] for [MISC Social Affairs  ] , [PER Zarouk Ibrahim Sharif  ] - Secretary of the [ORG General People 's Committee  ] for [ORG Justice  ] , [PER Mustafa Mohammad Abduljalil  ] - Secretary of the [ORG General People 's Committee  ] for [ORG Public Security  ] , [ORG General Abdelfatah Younis Obeidi  ] - Secretary of the [ORG General People 's Committee  ] for Foreign Liaison and [ORG International Cooperation  ] , [PER Musa Kusa  ] - Secretary of the [ORG General People 's Committee  ] for Education and [ORG Scientific Research Abdul  ] Kabir [PER Mohammed  ] al-Fakhri - Secretary of the [ORG General People 's Committee  ] for Transport [PER Mohamed Ali Zidane  ] - Secretary of the [ORG General People 's Committee  ] for [ORG Popular Control and Inspection Authority  ] , [PER Ibrahim Ali Ibrahim  ] - Secretary of the [ORG Financial Review Authority  ] , [PER Ali  ] [PER Omar Hesnawi  ] - Secretary of the [ORG National Planning Council  ] , [PER Bashir Ali Belgacem Zimbeel  ] [PER Ammar Mubarek  ] Eshamikh replaced Maftah al-Kaiba as the Secretary of the [ORG General People 's Congress  ] ( roughly Speaker of the [ORG House  ] ) while [PER Suleiman Shhoumi  ] became Secretary of the [ORG GPC  ] for Foreign Affairs ( [ORG Senate  ] Foreign Relations chair-equivalent ) . 
[ORG National Oil Company  ] head [PER Shukri Ghanem  ] will remain at the helm , as will the Housing and [ORG Infrastructure Board  ] 's [PER Abuzeid Dorda  ] - though both are rumored to be keen on leaving their positions and [PER Dorda  ] telling DCM that he will take up another position once he feels he has completed his mission . 
Reform-minded [PER Mahmoud Jibril  ] will retain his seat at the head of the [ORG Economic and Development Board  ] but will lose his role on the [ORG National Planning Council  ] that has been absorbed into the new [ORG Committee  ] for [ORG Planning  ] and Finance . 
7 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) Comment: It is too early to judge the effects the cabinet shakeup will have on [LOC Libya  ] 's domestic reform , [LOC Libya  ] 's role in regional and international affairs , and our bilateral relationship . 
[PER Musa Kusa  ] is a useful and powerful interlocutor who has been mostly cooperative in liaison channels and key to our re-engagement . 
He is seen as a mentor for [PER Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi , [PER Saif  ] al-Islam 's younger brother and head of the [ORG National Security Council  ] . 
At the same time , his appointment seems to come at the expense of the reform movement in [LOC Libya:  ] the lack of discussion of a formal constitution , the retention of al-Mahmoudi as PM , and the loss of key allies in ranking positions suggest that [PER Saif  ] al-Islam has come to a hurdle in his drive to secure political and economic reforms . 
This assessment would suggest a loss in stature relative to [PER Muatassim  ] , with whom he is widely rumored to be battling for power ( see ref G ) . 
However , the [MISC Serbian  ] Ambassador here ( a longtime observer of the [MISC Libyan  ] scene ) shared a different view with the Ambassador assessing that retaining al-Mahmoudi , installing [PER Zlitni  ] , and expanding [PER Matuq  ] 's portfolio boost [PER Saif  ] 's " rational " economic reform agenda by putting al-Qadhafi insiders in stronger policy-making roles , while increasing [PER Musa Kusa  ] 's reach balances [PER Saif  ] 's gains with [PER Muatassim  ] 's . 
[PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] 's seats at the [ORG UN Security Council  ] , as head of the [ORG African Union  ] , and Leader of a revolution celebrating its 40th anniversary on September 1 present plenty of opportunity for surprise . 
We expect the next six months to bring more clarity - perhaps accompanied by tumult - as to the direction will head politically .
