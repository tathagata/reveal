1 . 
( C ) Ministry for [ORG Foreign Affairs External Trade  ] Director [PER Martin Eyjolfsson  ] bleakly described for Ambassador and EconOff the difficult , ongoing negotiations with the [MISC British  ] delegation over the obligation and repayment connected with the [MISC Icelandic  ] IceSave accounts in the [LOC U.K.  ] [PER Eyjolfsson  ] said the [MISC British  ] government sent a " technical delegation " to negotiate ; the team consists of [ORG Finance Ministry  ] and the [ORG Bank of England  ] officials , but no diplomatic representatives . 
He said the lack of diplomatic presence has made it difficult for the [MISC British  ] team to appreciate the full effects of the [MISC British  ] authorities' actions in seizing [MISC Icelandic  ] assets under terrorism legislation . 
[PER Eyjolfsson  ] said , " If the [LOC U.K.  ] had seized [LOC France  ] 's sovereign gold reserves like they had [LOC Iceland  ] 's , a war between [LOC France  ] and the [LOC U.K.  ] would have broken out by now . 
" ( [PER Note: Featured  ] in the [MISC Icelandic  ] media today is the online petition " [MISC Icelanders Are Not Terrorists  ] , " ( www.indefense.is ) which is collecting photographs and signatures to send to PM [PER Gordon Brown  ] protesting the seizure of [MISC Icelandic  ] assets under the terrorism law .

( C ) According to [PER Eyjolfsson  ] , the [PER Icelanders  ] are arguing over both the principle and the terms of an agreement . 
[PER Eyjolfsson  ] asserted that the [ORG EU Directive  ] concerning bank funded insurance was not designed for a systemic meltdown and that the obligations of the state in such circumstances were not crystal clear . 
He said the [PER Icelanders  ] want to take this issue before the [ORG European Court of Justice  ] , but the [MISC British  ] team refused . 
[PER Eyjolfsson  ] said he told the [MISC Brits  ] it would be impossible politically for the government to sell their proposals to Parliament or the electorate . 
He said that since there is no diplomatic element to the delegation that this argument had no traction . 
[PER Eyjolfsson  ] said the only concern of the [LOC UK  ] is " to nail down the terms of a loan so they can get their money . 
" He mentioned that the [MISC Brits  ] had tossed out the figure of 13.5 percent interest , but the [PER Icelanders  ] offered 6 percent . 
The [PER Icelanders  ] had asked for a twenty year term but the [MISC Brits  ] countered with a ten year term . 
[PER Eyjolfsson  ] said even if they come to a deal , they will still need approval by the [MISC Icelandic  ] Parliament . 
He noted that the [MISC Dutch  ] agreement signed last week had only been initialed as an [ORG MOU  ] and that also faced parliamentary approval. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Eyjolfsson  ] said that the [MISC Icelandic  ] public needs time to absorb the enormity of the crisis . 
No one really fathoms yet that the government is going to go from ten percent of GDP as debt to 140 percent . 
He illustrated that each [MISC Icelandic  ] household would have to pay at least 500 USD every month - a fifth of their household income - for the next ten years just to service the interest of a loan to pay off the IceSave accounts . 
The [ORG IMF  ] loan would come on top of this debt burden . 
[PER Eyjolfsson  ] was emotional as he described some of the dire economic forecasts and said he just could not see how this was going to end or how the future of his young children could be ensured . 
He , as have others recently , predicted a mass emigration of talent from the country as the best and brightest will refuse to spend their lives under the burden of paying off the national debt. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Eyjolfsson  ] 's unusually frank and open discussion of ongoing negotiations with the [LOC UK  ] team are just one indication of how unusual and desperate is the situation here . 
The enormity of the debt and the responsibility of the [PER Icelanders  ] are not well understood by many here . 
Many of those who do understand are near despair .
