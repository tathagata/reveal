[LOC BEIRUT  ] 573 Classified By: Charge d’Affaires a.i . 
[PER Michele J. Sison  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . 
SUMMARY -------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) March 14 leader [PER Walid Jumblatt  ] questioned the utility of a new [ORG UN Security Council  ] resolution on [LOC Lebanon  ] if it does not address the border issue with [LOC Syria  ] and if it does not contain strong language . 
He noted that the [ORG GOL  ] had not yet agreed on whether an open session on the latest UNSCR 1559 report would be preferable to a closed session . 
Expressing his disappointment that Speaker [PER Nabih Berri  ] is refusing to meet majority leader [PER Saad Hariri  ] to discuss the [ORG National Dialogue  ] , [PER Jumblatt  ] said he remains supportive of holding the [ORG Dialogue  ] . 
He is hesitant about electing a president with a simple majority on May 13 . 
[PER Jumblatt  ] was joined mid-meeting my Justice Minister [PER Charles Rizk  ] , who confirmed that the [ORG GOL  ] is preparing to request the [ORG UN  ] to extend UNIIIC’s mandate next week . 
[PER Rizk  ] added that he is extremely concerned about the safety of [LOC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The Charge , accompanied by [PER PolOff  ] , met with [MISC Druze  ] leader [PER Walid Jumblatt  ] at his residence in [LOC Clemenceau  ] on April 30 . 
Justice Minister [PER Charles Rizk  ] , [LOC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , Chief Justice [PER Antoine Kheir  ] , and Minister of Displaced [PER Nehme Tohme  ] joined the meeting . 
HESITATION OVER A NEW UNSCR , OPEN DISCUSSION ON 1559 ---------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Jumblatt  ] questioned whether a new [ORG UN Security Council  ] resolution focused on putting the [MISC Lebanon-Syria  ] relationship on track ( Ref A ) would benefit [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
He said that it would need to mention borders , an inclusion which might not have unanimous support . 
He expressed his fear that any new resolution would have “watered-down” language , and would quickly lose momentum , thereby becoming “obsolete , like past resolutions.” He also was noncommittal about whether the next [ORG UN  ] session to discuss the latest UNSCR 1559 report should be open or closed , saying that the [ORG GOL  ] had not yet agreed whether it was ready to discuss the border issue with [LOC Syria  ] . 
MARCH 14 MARCHING AHEAD ----------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) “It is an injustice that [PER Berri  ] won’t see [PER Saad  ] , ” complained [PER Jumblatt  ] . 
Noting that Sheikh [MISC Qabalan  ] , head of the Higher [ORG Islamic Shia Council  ] , had urged [PER Berri  ] in a telephone call to meet [PER Saad  ] , [PER Jumblatt  ] said even if [PER Berri  ] agrees , it won’t have the same impact. “They should have met yesterday , ” he stated . 
Nevertheless , [PER Jumblatt  ] continued , you can’t say no to dialogue . 
[PER Jumblatt  ] said he believes a 13-7-10 cabinet division is “swallowable , ” but that he suspects [PER Berri  ] won’t be able to deliver on this because [LOC Syria  ] is waiting for the next [LOC U.S.  ] administration and for parliamentary elections in [LOC Lebanon  ] in hopes that it will be able to secure a more favorable division. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Jumblatt  ] stressed that a president must first be elected prior to discussing cabinet formation . 
Unsure about whether [ORG Lebanese Armed Forces  ] Commander [PER Michel Sleiman  ] will accept an election by a simple majority , [PER Jumblatt  ] was silent when asked about March 14’s backup strategy . 
( [PER Note: Saad’s  ] plan is to go to parliament on May 13 and elect a president , with a simple majority if necessary , Ref B. March 14 members seem to be counting on General Sleiman’s acceptance , though he has not yet indicated his willingness . 
[PER Jumblatt  ] himself did not appear eager to pursue a simple majority election . 
End note . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Jumblatt  ] reported that he will not see [ORG Arab League Secretary General  ] [PER Amr Moussa  ] when [PER Moussa  ] arrives in [LOC Beirut  ] SIPDIS May 1 because he is going to [LOC Jordan  ] to see King [PER Abdullah  ] , and then hopes to meet [MISC Egyptian  ] Foreign Minister [PER Ahmed Abu Gheit  ] . 
Nonchalant about the value of [MISC Moussa’s  ] visit , he said he was hopeful that the Qataris now appear to be siding with March [LOC BEIRUT  ] 00000586 002 OF 003 14 , “slowly but surely.” However , he wondered where [MISC French  ] policy stands today . 
HOW THE [LOC U.S.  ] CAN HELP --------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) When asked how the [ORG USG  ] could best support [LOC Lebanon  ] at this juncture , [PER Jumblatt  ] said he was pleased to see the USG’s recent public statements on Syria’s efforts to build nuclear weapons . 
[PER Jumblatt  ] half-jokingly said that the [LOC U.S.  ] should now send the [PER USS Nimitz  ] to intimidate [LOC Syria  ] . 
[PER Jumblatt  ] also suggested [LOC U.S.  ] assistance for [MISC Lebanese  ] prisons ( in response to recent prison riots in [LOC Roumieh  ] ) . 
[PER Rizk  ] added that a roadmap would be helpful to lay out how the [LOC U.S.  ] can best support the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] ( in addition to the ongoing $7 million USAID judicial training program ) . <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Jumblatt  ] noted that the [ORG GOL  ] had yet to receive the $1 billion central bank deposit promised by the [MISC Saudis  ] . 
Minister [PER Tohme  ] opined that the holdup is due to “Saudi culture , ” and the best way to get the money would be for Prime Minister [PER Foaud Siniora  ] to send his advisor , [PER Mohammed Chatah  ] , to spend four or five days sitting in [LOC Riyadh  ] “to move things along.” CONTINUED IMPORTANCE OF UNIIIC ------------------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Jumblatt  ] said the [ORG Special Tribunal  ] was “not enough” to intimidate [LOC Syria  ] . 
[PER Rizk  ] chimed in to acknowledge that work on the [ORG Special Tribunal  ] was “frightening to [LOC Syria  ] until recently.” Both agreed that [MISC Syrian  ] President [PER Bashar Assad  ] won’t care about the [ORG Tribunal  ] in a year’s time . 
[PER Rizk  ] repeated his concerns that UNIIIC Commissioner [PER Daniel Bellemare  ] had stated to some that he “has no case.” [PER Rizk  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] can help by directing Ambassador [PER Zalmay Khalilzad  ] to ask the [ORG UN  ] SYG to impress upon [PER Bellemare  ] the importance of his role as prosecutor for the [MISC Tribunal.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Rizk  ] pointed out that [PER Bellemare  ] should not be disassociating UNIIIC from the detention of the four generals suspected of involvement in [PER Rafiq Hariri’s  ] assassination because the blame then falls squarely on [LOC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOL  ] had not yet formally agreed to send a letter to the [ORG UNSC  ] requesting a six-month extension of UNIIIC’s mandate , [PER Rizk  ] reported , because the cabinet lacked the necessary quorum at its April 29 meeting . 
He said he had no doubt that the letter would be approved by the [ORG GOL  ] , adding that [PER Siniora  ] had only made one edit to the letter ( changing “as soon as possible” to “soon” ) . 
[PER Rizk  ] expressed his optimism about the letter’s success at the [ORG UNSC  ] because he changed the language to state that the [ORG GOL  ] “welcomes” [PER Bellemare  ] as prosecutor , instead of making a request ; it’s a letter you can’t say no to , [PER Rizk  ] affirmed . 
[ORG GOL  ] STILL PONDERING HOW TO REACT TO [ORG HIZBALLAH  ] FIBER OPTIC NETWORK -------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( S ) Meanwhile , in a separate conversation on [MISC Hizballah’s  ] progress in establishing a fiber optic network , Siniora’s senior advisor [PER Mohammed Chatah  ] told Charge that the network was yet another example of [MISC Hizballah’s  ] many infringements against the state . 
The network could thus not be separated from [MISC Hizballah’s  ] military activities . 
A [ORG GOL  ] public accusation against [ORG Hizballah  ] would beg the same question as to why the [ORG GOL  ] did not remove [MISC Hizballah’s  ] tanks , and entailed military risks for the [ORG GOL  ] . 
The [ORG UNSC  ] could not remain neutral to reports of increasing illegitimate [ORG Hizballah  ] activities , he noted , but the [ORG GOL  ] would have to be the one to initiate the accusation . 
[PER Chatah  ] also said there was no clear strategy within the [ORG GOL  ] on how to approach the problem , cited some disagreement between Defense Minister [LOC Murr  ] and Telecom Minister [PER Hamadeh  ] .
