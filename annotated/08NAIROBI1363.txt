( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The death of [PER Aden Hashi Ayrow  ] ( [PER Hawiye/Haber Gedir/Ayer  ] ) on May 1 will have several positive impacts: short-term disruption of terrorist operations of the [ORG Shabaab  ] , set back efforts at reconciliation between the [ORG Shabaab  ] and [ORG Islamic Court  ] militias , and potentially improve prospects for [MISC Somali  ] reconciliation . 
It has also set off a leadership struggle for control of the [ORG Shabaab  ] . 
The removal of [PER Ayrow  ] , a committed killer who has terrorized his own clan and was ostracized by some clan elders , removes a hard-line obstacle to reconciliation between the [ORG Ayr  ] and Prime Minister [PER Nur Adde  ] 's [ORG TFG  ] , and gives some breathing space to once-threatened communities . 
End Summary ---------- BACKGROUND ---------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Senior [ORG Al-Shabaab  ] leader and al-Qaida associate [PER Aden Hashi Ayrow  ] was killed May 1 during a [LOC U.S.  ] strike . 
In the early 1990s , [PER Ayrow  ] joined the military wing of [ORG Al-Ittihad Al-Islamiya  ] ( [ORG AIAI  ] ) and traveled to [LOC Afghanistan  ] in 1997 for unspecified training . 
[PER Ayrow  ] remained in [LOC Afghanistan  ] for a year before returning to [LOC Somalia  ] to participate in Jihadist activities , and returned to [LOC Afghanistan  ] in 2001 , reportedly meeting with [PER Osama bin Laden  ] . 
[PER Ayrow  ] emerged in the 2002/2003 timeframe as a firebrand extremist and he quickly became a rising figure in what eventually became the [ORG Shabaab  ] . 
Mercurial and largely uncontrollable , he was feared for his ruthlessness and unpredictability. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Ayrow  ] has been violently opposed to [LOC U.S.  ] and western interests in [LOC East Africa  ] . 
The [ORG Shabaab  ] 's emergence as a terrorist threat in [LOC Somalia  ] is closely linked to [PER Ayrow  ] 's rise to power . 
During the course of 2005 , [PER Ayrow  ] 's jihadist group emerged in [LOC Mogadishu  ] as a violent destabilizing force . 
He has been linked to the killing of foreign aid workers , dozens of [MISC Somalis  ] , and [ORG BBC  ] journalist [PER Kate Peyton  ] . 
He also was the figure largely responsible for the desecration of the [MISC Italian  ] cemetery in [LOC Mogadishu  ] . 
[PER Ayrow  ] 's al-Shabaab faction has also conducted suicide bombings and anti-aircraft attacks targeting [MISC Ethiopian  ] and [MISC Somali  ] forces in [LOC Somalia  ] . 
[PER Ayrow  ] was closely associated with [LOC East Africa  ] [ORG Al-Qaida  ] ( [ORG EAAQ  ] ) operatives [PER Harun Fazul  ] and [PER Saleh Nabhan  ] , and now-deceased [ORG EAAQ  ] cell leader [PER Abu Talha Al-Sudani.  ] ------------------------- The [ORG Shabaab  ] Lashes Out... ------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) According to reporting , [ORG Shabaab  ] operatives began retribution attacks against [MISC Ethiopian  ] forces following [PER Ayrow  ] 's death . 
Revenge attacks against [MISC Ethiopian  ] and [ORG TFG  ] forces are likely to continue and intensify in the short-term . 
The [ORG Shabaab  ] has also reportedly vowed to take revenge on [MISC American  ] , [MISC Ethiopian  ] , and [MISC Kenyan  ] interests in the region . 
Reactions to [PER Ayrow  ] 's death differ , even within the extremist movements . 
For some , particularly youthful fighters , he was [LOC Somalia  ] 's [LOC Zarqawi  ] , a figure to rally around . 
For others , while an effective terrorist , he was bullheaded , difficult , and eventually replaceable . 
For some clan elders his passing is a relief. --------------------------- ... and Leaders are Nervous --------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Regardless of personal views toward [PER Ayrow  ] , the strike unsettled the [ORG Shabaab  ] , giving some leaders immediate cause to wonder who would be next . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that [PER Ayrow  ] 's demise has put known al-Shabaab leaders on high alert . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that after the [MISC Ethiopian  ] [ORG National Defense Forces  ] ( [ORG ENDF  ] ) on May 5 killed [PER Amin Barqadle  ] ( [ORG Hawiye/Hawadle  ] ) , an extremist leader in the [MISC Hiraan  ] region associated with both the [ORG Islamic Courts  ] as well as the [ORG Shabaab  ] , [PER Robow  ] executed several of his own close bodyguards under suspicion that they were offering information on his operations. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The same [ORG MP  ] told us that last week in [LOC Beletwein  ] [PER Robow  ] and his militias entered the town to spend the night . 
All of the civilians vacated the area for fear that they would be targeted in an air strike . 
Previously in such a situation the community would have demonstrated at last nominal support for the [ORG Shabaab  ] in exchange for guarantees for " security , " sometimes food , and/or other resources . 
The [ORG MP  ] said that the strike on [PER Ayrow  ] has negatively influenced the relationship between [ORG Shabaab  ] and local residents . 
[LOC NAIROBI  ] 00001363 002.2 OF 002 ------------------------------- [ORG Business/Civil Society Reaction  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Over the past several weeks contacts within the business and civil society communities , those both for and against the [ORG TFG  ] , have reported there has been a quiet collective sigh of relief . 
Bakara market business leaders generally are pleased that [PER Ayrow  ] is gone -- his violent actions were a source of instability and disruption antithetical to the interests of business . 
[PER Ayrow  ] 's unwillingness to abide by the guidance and decisions of traditional clan ( [ORG Hawiye  ] ) and sub-clan ( [ORG Ayr  ] ) leaders was divisive and problematic for civil society efforts at reconciliation . 
While concerned about the possibility of revenge attacks on soft targets , the consensus among civil society and business leaders is that [LOC Somalia  ] is better off without [LOC Ayrow.  ] ------------------ [ORG Leadership Outlook  ] ------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Clan Dynamics and Leadership: Attacks  ] by the [ORG Shabaab  ] or associated militia are likely to continue , and there are various individuals eligible to fill the void created by [PER Ayrow  ] 's death . 
However , while attacks will continue from radical [MISC Islamists  ] and their followers -- whether individual cells or groupings that self-identify as [ORG Shabaab  ] or as [ORG Islamic Courts'  ] militia -- there is likely to be a continued struggle over the leadership of the [ORG Shabaab  ] . 
In the short-term , at least , this will have a negative impact on the [ORG Shabaab  ] 's effectiveness. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Ayrow  ] , a [PER Hawiye/Haber Gedir/Ayr  ] , operated in [ORG Hawiye  ] areas and those over whom he exercised leadership were primarily fellow clansmen . 
Likewise , the other clan ties of key [ORG Shabaab  ] leaders remained significant . 
[PER Muhktar Robow  ] is a [MISC Rahanweyn/Mirifle/Leysan  ] . 
He operates in the Bay region , the home of the [MISC Rahanweyn  ] , and his fighters are likely also to be predominately [MISC Rahanweyn  ] . 
[PER Hassan al-Turki  ] , who is the in [LOC Jubas  ] , is a [MISC Darod/Absame/Ogadeni  ] , and he too operates in the territory of and with followers from his clan . 
[PER Robow  ] was the first in the media after [PER Ayrow  ] 's death , a move viewed by some as an effort to stake out a leadership claim , and he has since tried to exert greater overall control. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) However , while [PER Robow  ] and [PER Turki  ] may view themselves as the rightful heirs to take over from [PER Ayrow  ] , neither are [ORG Hawiye  ] , and it is the [ORG Hawiye  ] , and particularly the [PER Hawiye/Haber Gedir/Ayr  ] , who have primarily been the leading force in the armed opposition to the [ORG TFG  ] . 
The current struggle in [LOC Somalia  ] is largely a struggle over control of [LOC Mogadishu  ] , and in turn the struggle over [LOC Mogadishu  ] is primarily a conflict about what many [ORG Hawiye  ] view as a [MISC Darod-led  ] [ORG TFG  ] trying to re-assert Darod dominance over a primarily [ORG Hawiye  ] city . 
While it is not clear who it would be , a [ORG Hawiye  ] extremist would likely challenge either [PER Robow  ] or [PER Turki  ] for leadership of the [ORG Shabaab  ] , and this process will take time to resolve . 
In the interim , the northern ( Galgudud and [LOC Hiraan  ] regions ) [MISC Hawiye-led  ] military operations of the [ORG Shabaab  ] have been set back by [PER Ayrow  ] 's death. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Shabaab  ] versus [ORG Islamic Courts'  ] Militia : Just prior to his death [PER Ayrow  ] had met with [PER Yusuf Mohamed Siad  ] " [PER Indha Adda  ] , " a fellow [ORG Ayr  ] clan member , and the former [ORG Council of Islamic Courts  ] ( [ORG CIC  ] ) head of security , and nominal head of militias . 
Presumably [PER Indha Adde  ] and [PER Ayrow  ] were discussing " reconciliation " between the [ORG Shabaab  ] and the [ORG CIC  ] militia and how they might collaborate more closely . 
The death of [PER Ayrow  ] complicates that effort . 
In addition to [PER Ayrow  ] 's removal by the [LOC U.S.  ] , our listing of the [ORG Shabaab  ] as a terrorist organization also has the potential to strengthen the attractiveness to recruits of the [ORG CIC  ] militia over the [ORG Shabaab  ] , and thereby hurt rather than help efforts at cooperation. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) We are urging President [PER Yusuf  ] and Prime Minister [PER Nur Adde  ] to seize whatever opportunity results from [PER Ayrow  ] 's death to intensify reconciliation efforts .
