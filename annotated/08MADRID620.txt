( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: We warmly welcome your visit . 
We are convinced there is much [LOC Spain  ] can do to support the [ORG AFRICOM  ] mission , so this will be a key opportunity . 
The challenge will be to engage them constructively on what the [LOC U.S.  ] is trying to accomplish with this new and innovative command . 
We have a strong military to military relationship upon which to build and a number of common interests in [LOC Africa  ] . 
Our [MISC Spanish  ] interlocutors will be very interested in what you have to say , and we strongly encourage you to solicit their views on [LOC Africa  ] , particularly the [LOC Maghreb  ] and [LOC Sahel  ] , where they have significant experience . 
End summary . 
Military Cooperation -------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [MISC Spanish  ] military cooperation is important to the [ORG USG  ] . 
The bases of [LOC Rota  ] and [LOC Moron  ] are strategic hubs , midway between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[LOC U.S.  ] planes and ships account for over 4,000 flights and 250 port calls a year in [LOC Spain  ] . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] military , particularly the [ORG Navy  ] , is pro-U.S. and pro-NATO . 
The [ORG Navy  ] employs the [MISC AEGIS  ] system in its frigates , is eager to acquire [MISC Tomahawk  ] , and is interested in the [ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] . 
[MISC Spanish  ] defense industry is a supplier to the [LOC U.S.  ] Although the [PER Zapatero  ] government has imposed a ceiling of 3,000 on troop deployments , [LOC Spain  ] has troops in [LOC Lebanon  ] ( 1,100 ) , [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( 750 ) , [LOC Kosovo  ] ( 500 ) , [LOC Bosnia  ] ( 260 ) , and a smattering of others in various [ORG UN  ] & [ORG EU  ] observer missions ( including the [LOC Democratic  ] [LOC Republic of  ] the [LOC Congo  ] ) . 
This month [LOC Spain  ] approved plans to send two cargo aircraft and 100 support personnel to the [ORG EU  ] mission in [LOC Chad.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Last August , we raised with the [ORG GOS  ] the possibility of basing at [LOC Rota  ] an [ORG AFRICOM  ] component ( the [ORG Joint Intelligence Operations Center  ] ) . 
FM [ORG Moratinos  ] later told the Ambassador that both President [PER Zapatero  ] and then-Defense Minister [PER Alonso  ] had said [LOC Spain  ] would enthusiastically like to be considered for the project . 
Both [ORG Moratinos  ] and [PER Alonso  ] thought this could be a great opportunity for increased bilateral cooperation in [LOC Africa  ] , a region of great long-term importance to [LOC Spain  ] and growing importance to the [LOC U.S.  ] We also have been advised informally by [ORG OSD  ] and [ORG JCS  ] that [LOC Rota  ] may be one of several locations under consideration for locating your headquarters . 
We think the [MISC Spanish  ] will be receptive to whatever concrete proposal we make ( although clearly hosting the headquarters presents more domestic political issues for [LOC Spain  ] ) . 
The key will be making it clear [ORG AFRICOM  ] wants to work closely with [LOC Spain  ] and respects [MISC Spanish  ] views on [LOC Africa  ] , hence the importance of your visit . 
We should discuss carefully the timing and content of any requests we make to the [MISC Spanish  ] in this regard. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Our [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Navy  ] colleagues have discussed with us the possibility of adding [LOC Tarragona  ] and [LOC Las Palmas  ] to the list of ports where we can take nuclear powered warships ( presently the list is [LOC Cartagena  ] , [LOC Palma de Mallorca  ] , and [LOC Rota  ] ) . 
We are very supportive of this effort , particularly in light of the potential benefit to [ORG AFRICOM  ] of adding [LOC Las Palmas  ] . 
However , the preliminary signals from the [MISC Spanish  ] military have been that there will be resistance to this request at the political level . 
We need to proceed carefully . 
We will discuss this issue further with [ORG Admiral Fitzgerald  ] during his June 4-6 visit and look forward to discussing it with you . 
Timing of the formal request will be critical . 
[MISC Spanish  ] Policy Towards [LOC Africa  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Because of history , proximity , immigration , terrorism , and the presence of [MISC Spanish  ] enclaves in [LOC Ceuta  ] and [LOC Melilla  ] , [LOC North Africa  ] is strategic for [LOC Spain  ] . 
At the outset of his second term , President [PER Zapatero  ] said that in the [MISC Mediterranean  ] , [LOC Spain  ] would work to guarantee security , fight terrorism , and increase law enforcement cooperation . 
He reportedly recently tasked FM [ORG Moratinos  ] with reinvigorating engagement with [LOC North Africa  ] , particularly with regard to immigration and security cooperation . 
The Ministers of [LOC Interior  ] of [LOC Spain  ] , [LOC France  ] , [LOC Portugal  ] , [LOC Italy  ] , [LOC Malta  ] , [LOC Algeria  ] , [LOC Libya  ] , [LOC Morocco  ] , [LOC Mauritania  ] , and [LOC Tunisia  ] agreed May 22 to strengthen counter-terrorism information exchange. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In the case of [LOC Western Sahara  ] , there are press reports indicating [PER Zapatero  ] plans to intensify efforts to promote a political solution . 
It is not yet clear how [LOC Spain  ] proposes to do this . 
[MISC Spanish  ] diplomats have told us [LOC Spain  ] 's primaryconcern is for regional stability through a negotiated solution that leads to a just , lasting outcome . 
While they note an independent [LOC Western Sahara  ] is not a realistic option , they are concerned that excessive pressure on the [MISC Polisario  ] to accept [LOC Morocco  ] 's proposals for some form of autonomy under [MISC Moroccan  ] sovereignty will lead to a total breakdown in the process. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) [LOC Sub-Saharan Africa  ] has not traditionally been a [MISC Spanish  ] priority , but that may be changing . 
In 2006 [LOC Spain  ] launched [ORG Plan Africa  ] ( 2006-2008 ) which provided for increased diplomatic and development assistance with [LOC sub-Saharan Africa  ] . 
[PER Zapatero  ] , who promised at the beginning of his second term to make [LOC sub-Saharan Africa  ] a top priority , has reportedly approved a new version for 2008-2012 . 
[LOC Nigeria  ] ( which supplies 25% of [LOC Spain  ] 's oil ) and [LOC South Africa  ] are likely to be priorities within [LOC sub-Saharan Africa  ] . 
[LOC Spain  ] has been increasing its diplomatic presence with new embassies ( [LOC Sudan  ] , [LOC Mali  ] , and [LOC Guinea  ] Bissau are the latest ) and new development offices ( [LOC Niger  ] , the [LOC Democratic  ] [LOC Republic of  ] the [LOC Congo  ] , and [LOC Kenya  ] ) . 
There are reportedly plans afoot to open several more development offices . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] equivalent of [LOC USAID  ] has a budget of about 700 million euros for [LOC Africa  ] . 
[LOC Spain  ] also maintains political and economic interests in its former colony of [LOC Equatorial Guinea.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) You may hear about the April 20-26 incident in which a [MISC Spanish  ] fishing vessel ( the " [ORG Playa de Bakio  ] " ) was taken by [MISC Somali  ] pirates . 
In their May 19 meeting FM [ORG Moratinos  ] thanked Secretary Rice for the intelligence and military support the [LOC U.S.  ] provided during the incident . 
[ORG Moratinos  ] stressed continued [MISC Spanish  ] concern with pirates off [LOC Somalia  ] given that [LOC Spain  ] has dozens of vessels in the area and no way to protect them . 
He noted that [LOC Spain  ] strongly supported [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to get an anti-piracy resolution adopted in the [ORG UNSC  ] . 
Testifying before the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG Congress  ] May 22 , [ORG Moratinos  ] said [LOC Spain  ] would be willing to take its turn leading an anti-piracy force off [LOC Somalia  ] if there was [ORG UN  ] backing for the mission ( he ducked questions about whether [LOC Spain  ] had paid a ransom to free the [ORG Playa de Bakio  ] crew ) . 
[MISC Counter-Terrorism  ] , Narcotics , and Illegal Immigration --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [LOC Spain  ] is an al-Qaeda target and a critical player in [MISC U.S.-EU  ] counter-terrorism efforts due to its proximity to the [LOC Maghreb  ] and a population that includes more than one million [MISC Muslims  ] , mostly immigrants . 
[ORG Al-Qaeda  ] has called for attacks to recapture the medieval " [PER Al Andalus  ] . 
" [LOC Ceuta  ] and [LOC Melilla  ] are a fixation for some extremists . 
In 2004 Madrid suffered bloody train bombings perpetrated by [MISC Islamic  ] extremists . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] Government considers the threat from [MISC Islamic  ] terrorism to be one of its top national security priorities and has identified numerous [MISC Islamic  ] extremist groups operating within its borders . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] are actively pursuing [MISC Islamic  ] extremism terrorism-related investigations and have scores of suspects in jail . 
Public opinion polling shows nearly three quarters of [MISC Spaniards  ] worried about the threat of [MISC Islamic  ] fundamentalism , more than in the [LOC U.S.  ] or [LOC Europe  ] as a whole. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Bilateral cooperation is strong . 
[LOC Spain  ] pursues an aggressive agenda in law enforcement , judicial , and information-sharing efforts with us . 
One example is the [MISC HSPD-6  ] agreement we signed in 2007 to facilitate the sharing of information between our national counter-terrorism authorities . 
[LOC Spain  ] participates in the [ORG Container Security Initiative  ] ( in the ports of [LOC Algeciras  ] , [LOC Barcelona  ] , and [ORG Valencia  ] ) and the [ORG Megaports Initiative  ] to detect radioactive cargo ( in the port of [LOC Algeciras  ] with anticipated expansion to [LOC Barcelona  ] and [ORG Valencia  ] in the upcoming year ) . 
[LOC Spain  ] also participates in the [ORG Proliferation Security Initiative  ] . 
Stovepipes within the [MISC Spanish  ] system and interagency rivalries are a continuing challenge both for them and us . 
In addition to the threat from [MISC Islamic  ] extremists , [LOC Spain  ] has been fighting the domestic terrorists of the [ORG Basque Fatherland and Liberty  ] ( [ORG ETA  ] ) for four decades. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The [MISC Spanish  ] Government ranks drug trafficking as one of its most important law enforcement concerns and maintains excellent relations with [LOC U.S.  ] law enforcement . 
[LOC Spain  ] remains the principal entry , transshipment , and consumption zone for the large quantities of [MISC South American  ] cocaine and [MISC Moroccan  ] cannabis destined for [MISC European  ] consumer markets , and is also a major source and transit location for drug proceeds returning to [LOC South  ] and [LOC Central America  ] . 
There is mounting evidence that [LOC West Africa  ] is beginning to play an increasingly important role in this trafficking . 
[LOC Spain  ] also faces a sustained flow of hashish from its southern neighbors , [LOC Morocco  ] and [LOC Algeria  ] , which makes maritime smuggling across the [MISC Mediterranean  ] a large-scale business . 
Seizures of multi-ton loads of [MISC Moroccan  ] hashish are not uncommon , some of it brought into [LOC Spain  ] by illegal immigrants . 
[MISC Spanish  ] authorities cooperate closely with the [ORG DEA Madrid Country Office  ] . 
In May 2007 , [LOC Spain  ] hosted the [ORG International Drug Enforcement Conference  ] ( [ORG IDEC  ] ) in [LOC Madrid  ] , the first time [ORG IDEC  ] had been held outside of the [LOC Western Hemisphere  ] . 
Also in 2007 , [LOC Spain  ] and six other [ORG EU  ] countries deepened their counter-narcotics cooperation by signing an international agreement creating the [ORG Maritime Analysis and Operations Center  ] ( [ORG MAOC  ] ) , headquartered in [LOC Lisbon.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The premier [MISC Spanish  ] law enforcement agencies are the [ORG National Police  ] and the [ORG Civil Guard  ] , both of which fall under the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] . 
Their jurisdictions overlap to a significant degree , although historically the [ORG Civil Guard  ] has a stronger presence in rural areas and small towns . 
Both agencies have investigative jurisdiction over all types of crimes including alien smuggling , human trafficking , terrorism and terrorist financing , and narcotics . 
The [ORG National Police  ] also have jurisdiction over documentation for nationals and foreigners ( passports , residence cards , and national identity documents ) . 
The [ORG Civil Guard  ] 's authorities include contraband and customs control . 
The [ORG Spanish Customs Service  ] , under the [ORG Ministry of the Treasury  ] , also carries a mandate to enforce anti-drug legislation at [LOC Spain  ] 's borders and in [MISC Spanish  ] waters . 
[LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG Organized Crime Intelligence Center  ] ( [ORG CICO  ] ) coordinates ( with varying degrees of success ) counter-narcotics operations among various government agencies , including the [ORG National Police  ] , [ORG Civil Guard  ] , [ORG and Customs Service  ] . 
Although it does not have a domestic law enforcement function , the [MISC Spanish  ] Navy acts on the high seas and also has assets operating in coastal waters . 
Protecting [LOC Spain  ] from threats such as terrorism , narcotics trafficking , and alien smuggling requires joint and multi-agency action , and it is strongly in the [LOC U.S.  ] interest to deepen cooperation with both [ORG MOD  ] and MOI on maritime threats. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( U ) Historically [LOC Spain  ] received few immigrants , but the rapidly increasing prosperity of recent decades has changed that . 
Immigrants now account for about ten percent of the population . 
There are over three million registered immigrants , many from [LOC Latin America  ] and [LOC Romania  ] . 
However , the single largest nationality is [MISC Moroccan  ] ( about 600,000 ) . 
There is also a significant [MISC Pakistani  ] community . 
The number of sub-Saharan [MISC African  ] immigrants in [LOC Spain  ] is only about two percent of the total . 
In general , [LOC Spain  ] has been welcoming to immigrants , but a souring economy may change that . 
[LOC Spain  ] is also awakening to the danger illegal immigration represents in terms of terrorism and organized crime . 
Reports of illegal immigrants arriving from [LOC Africa  ] via mother ships receive significant press play as do frequent arrivals of boatloads of illegal immigrants in the [MISC Canaries  ] . 
The [ORG Civil Guard  ] has responsibility for policing as well as social and humanitarian functions with respect to illegal immigration . 
Of the three routes for illegal immigration ( air , land , and maritime ) , the maritime flow has expanded most significantly with the appearance of small boats ( pateras or cayucos ) . 
During the Summer of 2006 these small boats carried over 30,000 illegal immigrants to the [MISC Canaries  ] . 
The [ORG Civil Guard  ] manages a coordination and communications center in [LOC Las Palmas  ] . 
From this center , [MISC Spanish  ] and [ORG EU  ] air and sea operations are directed against maritime alien smuggling . 
The center 's objectives are deterrence , interdiction , and rescue . 
The center has brought about a significant reduction in illegal immigration to the [LOC Canary Islands  ] . 
Members of the [ORG National Police  ] and [ORG Civil Guard  ] are also deployed in [LOC Africa  ] ( [LOC Morocco  ] , [LOC Cape Verde  ] , [LOC Senegal  ] , and [LOC Mauritania  ] ) in [ORG Project Sea Horse  ] . 
This includes liaison , equipment , and training . 
Numerous other projects are underway to work in concert with other countries to stem the flow of illegal immigration ( e.g. , joint projects with [LOC Morocco  ] related to [LOC Ceuta  ] and [LOC Melilla  ] , [LOC FRONTEX  ] , and the [ORG Euro-Africa Conference  ] ) . 
Political and [ORG Economic Climate  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) President [PER Zapatero  ] 's center left [MISC Spanish  ] Socialist Workers , Party ( [ORG PSOE  ] ) was the victor in the March 9 general election . 
The principal opposition party remains the center right [ORG Popular Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] public is skeptical of [LOC U.S.  ] foreign policy but supportive of good bilateral relations . 
[LOC Spain  ] has enjoyed one of the fastest growing economies in [LOC Europe  ] , but growth is slowing significantly . 
A housing boom that had contributed greatly to growth for several years ended abruptly last year and prices are stagnating , construction slowing , and unemployment and inflation rising . 
The rapid increase in unemployment may make [LOC Spain  ] a somewhat less welcoming destination for [MISC African  ] immigrants . 
[LOC U.S.  ] investment has long been important to the economy ( more so than bilateral trade ) , but the tables have turned . 
In 2007 , [LOC Spain  ] was the fourth largest foreign investor in the [LOC U.S.  ] , with particular emphasis in banking , construction , and renewable energy . 
Conclusion ---------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Again , we are looking forward to your visit . 
We are firmly convinced [ORG AFRICOM  ] 's mission and [LOC Spain  ] 's strategic interests coincide in many important respects and that there is much the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Spain  ] can do together .
