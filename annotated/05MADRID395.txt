( C ) Summary . 
Coordinator for [LOC Afghanistan  ] [PER Maureen Quinn  ] , accompanied by [ORG Department of Defense  ] , [ORG JCS  ] , and [ORG State Department  ] officers met with [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG MOD  ] , [ORG MFA  ] and Presidency officials on 1/26 to discuss [LOC Spain  ] 's commitment to lead a [ORG PRT  ] in western [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Just before Ambassador [PER Quinn  ] 's arrival , the [ORG GOS  ] released a brief statement indicating that it was " studying " the possibility of both a [MISC Spanish  ] deployment to western [LOC Afghanistan  ] and taking over the [ORG FSB  ] in [LOC Herat  ] . 
The [ORG MOD  ] meeting will be reported via septel . 
[ORG GOS  ] officials told the [ORG USG  ] team that the press release was intended to convey [LOC Spain  ] 's determination to lead a [ORG PRT  ] , though operational and political details remain to be worked out . 
[ORG MFA  ] Director General for Foreign Policy [PER Rafael Dezcallar  ] described the [ORG PRT  ] decision as one of several recent [ORG GOS  ] gestures aimed at repairing bilateral relations with the [ORG USG  ] . 
[PER Dezcallar  ] said that Foreign Minister [PER Moratinos  ] may travel to [LOC Afghanistan  ] soon and that [LOC Spain  ] may establish a permanent diplomatic mission in [LOC Kabul.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) At the [LOC Presidential Palace  ] , Deputy [ORG National Security Advisor  ] [PER Maria Alonso  ] stressed the [ORG Zapatero Government  ] 's need to build public support for the deployment , given the general [MISC Spanish  ] skepticism towards overseas military missions of any type . 
She reviewed the steps necessary for the [ORG GOS  ] to obtain Parliamentary approval of the [ORG PRT  ] mission and said she was confident that the deployment would be approved with minimal debate . 
She said [LOC Spain  ] would also like to further discuss the [ORG USG  ] offer to consider providing civilian experts to aid the [ORG PRT  ] , per [ORG REF  ] A points . 
End Summary. //MFA: [LOC SPAIN  ] COMMITTED TO AFGHANISTAN// <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG MOD  ] DG for Policy Admiral [PER Torrente  ] confirmed to Ambassador [PER Quinn  ] that [LOC Spain  ] plans to lead a [ORG PRT  ] in western [LOC Afghanistan  ] , specifically at [LOC Qal'eh-ye Now  ] , and to contribute troops to the [ORG FSB  ] at [LOC Herat  ] . 
Full details of the [ORG MOD  ] meeting will be provided septel. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) At the [ORG MFA  ] , DG [PER Dezcallar  ] pointed to the success of [ORG ISAF  ] and OEF operations in [LOC Afghanistan  ] as a " demonstration that multilateralism can be effective " and said [ORG NATO  ] could be proud of its work in " helping the [MISC Afghans  ] help themselves . 
" Ambassador [PER Quinn  ] agreed that much had been accomplished , especially through new models such as PRTs . 
She welcomed the news of [LOC Spain  ] 's decision to lead a [ORG PRT  ] in western [LOC Afghanistan  ] and to participate in the [LOC Herat  ] [MISC FSB.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Dezcallar  ] said the [ORG PRT  ] decision was " intentionally leaked " by the [ORG GOS  ] in order to convey [LOC Spain  ] 's commitment to the long-term reconstruction of [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
He said this was driven by strategic considerations , since [LOC Spain  ] 's investigation of the March 11 train bombings in [LOC Madrid  ] suggested that the order to carry out the bombing had come from individuals based in [LOC Afghanistan.  ] //NEXT STEPS ON [MISC SPANISH  ] PRT// <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) While [PER Dezcallar  ] emphasized that the [ORG GOS  ] has made the political decision to participate in a [ORG PRT  ] , he also noted that several steps remain . 
First , [LOC Spain  ] will send a team of [ORG MOD  ] and [ORG MFA  ] experts to [LOC Afghanistan  ] to scout the precise locations where [MISC Spanish  ] forces will be deployed: [LOC Herat  ] and [LOC Qal'eh  ] ) ye Now ( NOTE: The scouting team departed for [LOC Afghanistan  ] on 1/28 . 
END NOTE ) . 
Second , the [ORG GOS  ] will analyze the report of the team and deliver a recommendation to President [PER Zapatero  ] as to how [LOC Spain  ] 's deployment should proceed . 
Lastly , President [PER Zapatero  ] will " consult " with Parliament to gain legislative support for the mission. //MENDING FENCES WITH USG// <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Dezcallar  ] made clear that an important factor in [LOC Spain  ] 's decision to proceed with a [ORG PRT  ] was their sense that it would help bring an end to bilateral tensions between [LOC Madrid  ] and [LOC Washington  ] . 
[PER Dezcallar  ] said he knew the [ORG USG  ] appreciated actions more than words , so [LOC Spain  ] had moved ahead on [LOC Afghanistan  ] and other issues , including [LOC Spain  ] 's contribution of $20 million to the [ORG UNDP  ] to support the [LOC Iraq  ] elections , [ORG GOS  ] diplomatic efforts to encourage good behavior on the part of [LOC Iraq  ] 's neighbors , and the decision of President [PER Zapatero  ] not to stop in [LOC Venezuela  ] during his visit to [LOC Latin America  ] . 
[PER Dezcallar  ] said he hoped these positive steps would be recognized by the [ORG USG  ] and would encourage reciprocal gestures from [LOC Washington  ] . 
He said " normalization " of ties with [LOC Spain  ] would help both sides work together to advance the [ORG USG  ] 's " ambitious reform process " in the [LOC Mideast  ] and suggested [LOC Spain  ] 's experience with the [ORG Barcelona Process  ] could prove useful for the [LOC U.S.  ] Ambassador [PER Quinn  ] said the [ORG USG  ] appreciated the positive steps taken by the [ORG GOS  ] and told [PER Dezcallar  ] that she would carry his message to [LOC Washington.  ] //DEEPER [MISC SPANISH  ] ROLE IN AFGHANISTAN// <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Dezcallar  ] said that Foreign Minister [PER Moratinos  ] may travel to [LOC Afghanistan  ] in the next several months . 
In addition , [LOC Spain  ] hopes to establish a permanent diplomatic mission soon in [LOC Kabul  ] and would eventually like to open an embassy . 
Ambassador [PER Quinn  ] encouraged this increased [ORG GOS  ] engagement , saying the [MISC Afghan  ] people were counting on the international community to help them realize their growing hopes for stability and economic growth . 
[PER Dezcallar  ] noted that the [ORG GOS  ] has directed aid to [LOC Afghanistan  ] through the [ORG Asian Development Bank  ] , but would be willing to study other possible assistance projects , including on counter narcotics. //OEF ) [ORG ISAF  ] MERGER// <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) At [PER Dezcallar  ] 's request , the [ORG USG  ] team briefed him on the security situation in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and the state of play among the various regional leaders and factions . 
[PER Dezcallar  ] said he was encouraged by the [ORG USG  ] 's information regarding improved security conditions and suggested that coordination between [ORG ISAF  ] and OEF operations will have to improve and perhaps even be merged as [ORG ISAF  ] moves westward . 
( NOTE: We assume [PER Dezcallar  ] was suggesting the merger of the missions under an overall [ORG NATO  ] command , since it is highly unlikely the [ORG GOS  ] would place [MISC Spanish  ] forces at the disposition of a [LOC U.S.  ] command through participation in OEF . 
END NOTE . 
) Ambassador [PER Quinn  ] agreed that integration is the right move , but said that we have no set timeline . 
She noted the already high level of coordination between OEF and [ORG ISAF  ] personnel. //PRESIDENCY: A FEW BUMPS ON THE ROAD TO PRT// <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) In her meeting with Deputy [ORG National Security Advisers  ] [PER Maria Alonso  ] and [PER Diego de Ojeda  ] , Ambassador [PER Quinn  ] expressed the [ORG USG  ] 's appreciation of [LOC Spain  ] 's decision to lead a [ORG PRT  ] and to contribute forces to the [ORG FSB  ] in [LOC Herat  ] . 
[PER Alonso  ] , who covers the [LOC North America  ] account , said the [ORG GOS  ] was pleased that the [ORG MOD  ] and [ORG MFA  ] had presented a good plan for [LOC Spain  ] 's participation and that the [ORG GOS  ] now had to explain the mission to a public skeptical of any [MISC Spanish  ] military deployment abroad . 
[PER Alonso  ] was confident that the [ORG GOS  ] would have no problem in gaining Parliamentary approval for the deployment since the [ORG Popular Party  ] , the largest opposition party , supported the [ORG NATO  ] mission in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
However , [PER Diego de Ojeda  ] pointed out that the [ORG PRT  ] proposal would have to be slipped in between major legislative action on controversial internal issues , perhaps briefly delaying formal approval of the [ORG PRT  ] . 
Also the two small leftist parties that generally work with the Socialists to give them a Parliamentary majority will vote against [LOC Spain  ] 's leadership of a [ORG PRT  ] , creating a minor , but unwelcome rift within the center-left. //USG SUPPORT// <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Alonso  ] indicated that [LOC Spain  ] wants to emphasize the civil reconstruction aspect of its [ORG PRT  ] , but lacks civilian experts to support that element of the mission . 
[LOC Spain  ] hopes to establish strong links to [ORG NGOs  ] already operating in western [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Alonso  ] also alluded to the [ORG USG  ] offer per REF A to consider making [LOC U.S.  ] civilian experts available to buttress the [MISC Spanish  ] deployment , saying [LOC Spain  ] would appreciate such assistance . 
Ambassador [PER Quinn  ] and [PER Alonso  ] discussed the makeup of the existing PRTs and the [ORG USG  ] team urged [LOC Spain  ] to study all of the models in developing its own plans .
