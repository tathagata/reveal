Reason: 1.4 ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary . 
Rumors about Prime Minister [PER Putin  ] 's disengagement from his duties have proliferated in [LOC Moscow  ] , suggesting that he has lost his " edge " in making critical decisions on measures linked to the economic crisis . 
[PER Putin  ] has reportedly been " working from home " on many issues , leaving much of the running of the government to his deputies , particularly First Deputy Prime Minister [PER Igor Shuvalov  ] . 
While some here see [PER Putin  ] 's withdrawal as increasing the odds that he might step down from office , most continue to emphasize his centrality in the political constellation , with his hands-off behavior reflecting the lack of an acceptable compromise amongst the [LOC Kremlin  ] elite on difficult economic issues . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) There are consistent reports that [PER Putin  ] resents or resists the workload he carries as Prime Minister to galvanize the [MISC Russian  ] bureaucracy . 
Well-connected [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that [PER Putin  ] is said to be " distracted " and " disinterested , " leaving day-to-day management of the [ORG GOR  ] to [PER Shuvalov  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , who was a member of [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , said that only [PER Putin  ] has the authority to lead the [ORG GOR  ] and , in his absence , economic policy responses to the crisis have been entirely ad hoc . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] saw the ongoing budget revision process as further evidence of [PER Putin  ] 's fatigue ; in more resolute times , [PER Putin  ] would have ended the fiscal haggling quickly . 
Instead , it has dragged on for two months during the worst financial crisis in a decade . 
Prominent [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] agreed about [PER Putin  ] 's isolation , saying that the PM is increasingly isolated and has regular contact only with [PER Shuvalov  ] and [ORG Kudrin.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Similarly , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that [PER Putin  ] has not been on a regular schedule at the [MISC Russian  ] [LOC White House  ] , preferring to leave the day-to-day operations of government in the hands of the " actual Prime Minister " [PER Shuvalov  ] , an assessment shared by [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] alleged that there are a number of documents waiting for [PER Putin  ] 's signature , several of which are linked to the government 's anti-crisis package , that are creating backups in the implementation of important projects . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us it is well known that [PER Putin  ] did not like coming to the [MISC Russian  ] [LOC White House  ] , where he was confronted with stacks of papers on issues of minuscule importance , on which he did not want to expend his energy . 
The problem , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted , was that the [MISC Russian  ] system was geared to top-down decisions and paralysis was often the result of [PER Putin  ] 's inaction. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The rise of rumors such as these suggest that [PER Putin  ] may be losing some of his [MISC Teflon  ] persona under the pressures of [LOC Russia  ] 's economic woes , at least among the elite . 
However , recent [MISC Levada  ] surveys reinforce that most [MISC Russians  ] continue to see [PER Putin  ] as " running " the country ( 87 percent of respondents saw him holding his power , up from 74 percent a year ago ) . 
While some speculate that [PER Putin  ] 's disengagement may presage a readiness to step down from office , most continue to stress his centrality in the ruling structure and his personal sense as the " savior " of [LOC Russia  ] . 
Indeed , his disengagement reflects his long-standing predilection to prevaricate on difficult issues and his recognition that a sharp reduction in resources limits his ability to find workable compromises among the [LOC Kremlin  ] elite .
