( C ) Summary . 
[ORG National Court Examining Magistrate  ] [PER Ismael Moreno  ] requested on January 31 that the [ORG Spanish Ministry of Defense  ] and the [ORG National Intelligence Center  ] ( [ORG CNI  ] ) declassify any information related to the transit of [ORG CIA  ] aircraft through [MISC Spanish  ] territory , as well as any information indicating whether [MISC Spanish  ] airports were used for the transfer of detainees in other countries . 
In a related action , Judge [PER Moreno  ] denied a motion by the plaintiffs to require the current and former heads of the [ORG CNI  ] to testify in the case , as well as a second motion by the plaintiffs to name as suspects the 13 [LOC U.S.  ] persons listed in the investigation . 
In an unusual demonstration of bipartisan accord , both the ruling Socialist ( [ORG PSOE  ] ) and opposition [ORG Popular Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) Parliamentarians expressed support for the declassification of the requested documents . 
The [ORG National Court  ] prosecutor handling the [ORG CIA  ] flights case told [PER Legat  ] that the prosecutors would not seek to block the request for declassified information because it was understood by [MISC Spanish  ] authorities that neither the [ORG CNI  ] nor the [ORG MOD  ] held any incriminating or sensitive information related to the flights . 
The prosecutor said that the release of the little information they did have would do no harm and said that the [MISC Spanish  ] Government would not seek additional information from the [ORG USG  ] related to this case . 
We are less concerned by the immediate importance of any declassified information from the [ORG CNI  ] or [ORG MOD  ] than by the apparent coordination between Judge [PER Moreno  ] in [LOC Spain  ] and [MISC German  ] investigators in the [PER El Masri  ] case . 
[MISC Spanish  ] media reported January 31 and February 1 that [MISC German  ] investigators used information from [MISC Spanish  ] news sources and from the [ORG Spanish Civil Guard  ] in ordering the detention of 13 " [ORG CIA  ] members " on charges of abduction and bodily harm . 
The plaintiffs and extreme left political parties will work together to keep this issue on the front burner in [LOC Spain  ] . 
End Summary. //JUDGE REQUESTS DECLASSIFICATION OF OFFICIAL INFORMATION// <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Judge [PER Moreno  ] approved requests by the plaintiffs in the [ORG CIA  ] flights case , the " [ORG Free Association of Attorneys  ] " and a group of [MISC Mallorcan  ] professionals , calling for the declassification of any information held by the [ORG CNI  ] or the [ORG MOD  ] related to the transit of alleged [ORG CIA  ] aircraft through the airports of [LOC Tenerife  ] , [LOC Barcelona  ] , [LOC Malaga  ] , [LOC Palma de Mallorca  ] , and others . 
According to reports , the [MISC Spanish  ] judicial investigation is focused on the following flights: - [LOC Algiers  ] to [LOC Palma  ] to [LOC Skopje  ] on January 22 , 2004 - [LOC Guantanamo  ] to [LOC Tenerife  ] to [LOC Constanza  ] , [LOC Romania  ] on April 12 , 2004 , and - [LOC Madrid  ] to [LOC Luxor  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] on December 16 , 2003 . 
In his request to the [ORG MOD  ] , Judge [PER Moreno  ] asks for a report on " whether [MISC Spanish  ] airports were used in the alleged events described in [ORG Council of Europe Report  ] 10957 of June 12 , 2006 " related to the detentions of 12 alleged terrorists: Jaled [MISC El Masri  ] , [PER Ahmed Agiza  ] , [PER Mohammed al Zary  ] , [PER Hasam Usama  ] , [PER Mustafa Nasr  ] ( [PER Abu Omar  ] ) , [PER Bisher al Rawi  ] , [PER Yamil El Banna  ] , [PER Masher Arar  ] , [PER Mohamed Bashmila  ] , [PER Salah Ali Qaru  ] , [PER Mohammed Zammar  ] , and [PER Binyam Mohammed.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Judge [PER Moreno  ] denied motions by the plaintiffs demanding that the 13 [LOC U.S.  ] persons accused by the plaintiffs of abduction and torture ( REF A ) be formally named as suspects . 
[PER Moreno  ] said that he would not do so because the identities of the crew of the [ORG Boeing  ] 737 , tail number [MISC N313P  ] , had not been firmly established . 
He also denied a plaintiff 's motion requiring the testimony in the case of [ORG CNI  ] Director [PER Alberto Saiz  ] as well as his predecessor [PER Jorge Dezcallar  ] ( brother of MFA Director General for Foreign Policy [PER Rafael Dezcallar  ] ) . 
This request by the plaintiffs stems from a November 28 , 2001 meeting between President [PER Bush  ] and then-President [PER Aznar  ] , after which [PER Aznar  ] reportedly declared that " all of the mechanisms for cooperation in intelligence operations " were in place . 
Shortly thereafter , on December 11 , the first alleged [ORG CIA  ] flight through [MISC Spanish  ] territory [LOC MADRID  ] 00000173 002.2 OF 003 took place. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) Judge [PER Moreno  ] also set aside a request by the plaintiffs for the testimony of the former [ORG Council of Europe  ] human rights commissioner [PER Alvaro Gil-Robles  ] ( on the grounds that [MISC Gil-Robles'  ] reports on a detention center in [LOC Kosovo  ] had not led to any conclusive police investigations ) and the testimony of " [ORG El Pais  ] " journalist [PER Jose Maria Irujo  ] , who has followed the [ORG CIA  ] flights case as well as [MISC Islamic  ] extremism in [LOC Spain  ] . 
Judge [PER Moreno  ] indicated that his decisions on all of these issues ( the naming of the 13 persons as suspects , requiring the testimony of [ORG CNI  ] directors , and calling of additional witnesses ) could be revisited by him or by a panel of trial judges if new information emerged to support the plaintiffs' case. //BIPARTISAN POLITICAL SUPPORT FOR DECLASSIFICATION// <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Politicians weighed in quickly on the decision , with ruling center-left [ORG PSOE  ] and opposition center-right [ORG PP  ] Parliamentarians voicing their support for the declassification of the relevant [ORG MOD  ] and [ORG CNI  ] records . 
[ORG PSOE Foreign Relations Commission Spokesperson  ] [PER Fatima Aburto  ] said all documents should be declassified that pointed to any " illegal act that may have taken place in [LOC Spain  ] . 
" [PER Aburto  ] said that the focus should be on whether the aircraft in question had " illegally detained persons " aboard and said that the [ORG Zapatero Government  ] would review its files to determine whether any such incriminating information was available that could assist in the investigation . 
[PER Aburto  ] said that documents that information indicating that a [ORG USG  ] aircraft had made a stopover in [LOC Spain  ] and then participated in an illegal act in a third country " should not be declassified , because such actions would not constitute the commission of an illegal act in [LOC Spain  ] . 
" She stressed the [ORG PSOE  ] 's dedication to deal with this issue in a transparent manner and said that the results of [MISC Spanish  ] Government inquiries to the [ORG USG  ] on this matter did not indicate that any crime had been committed. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) [ORG PP Foreign Relations Commission Spokesperson  ] [PER Gustavo Aristegui  ] said that he supported the declassification of any relevant documents if they demonstrated the commission of an illegal act and if their release did not undermine the counter-terrorist operations . 
[PER Aristegui  ] said that democratic countries could not " resort to any type of illegal methods in the fight against terrorism " since this would only strengthen the terrorists . 
He pointed to [LOC Guantanamo  ] and [PER Abu Ghraib  ] as " errors that should not be repeated . 
" //PROSECUTOR DISCUSSES [ORG CIA  ] FLIGHTS CASE WITH LEGAT// <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The [ORG National Court  ] prosecutor handling the [ORG CIA  ] flights case , [PER Vicente Gonzalez Mota  ] ( strictly protect ) , indicated to [MISC Legat  ] that the prosecutors do not intend to request information on this case from the [ORG Embassy  ] or from the [ORG USG  ] in general . 
He said that the [ORG National Court  ] prosecutors did not impede Judge [PER Moreno  ] 's request to declassify the [ORG MOD  ] or [ORG CNI  ] records because it was clear that those records did not contain any incriminating or even particularly sensitive information . 
( NOTE: [PER Vicente Gonzalez Mota  ] is also the principal liaison to the [ORG Embassy  ] for the [ORG Bilateral Counter Terrorism Experts Working Group  ] . 
END NOTE ) . 
A January 31 news report indicates that [PER Gonzalez Mota  ] filed a judcicial assistance request to [MISC Swiss  ] authorities for any information ( [ORG NFI  ] ) gathered by prosecutors in [LOC Bern  ] that might have a bearing on the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG CIA  ] flights investigation. //CONFLUENCE OF [MISC SPANISH-GERMAN INVESTIGATIONS//  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) [MISC Spanish  ] media reported widely on the detention order filed by [MISC German  ] prosecutor [PER Christian Schmidt-Sommerfeld  ] against " 13 alleged [ORG CIA  ] members " for involvement in the " abduction and bodily harm " of [MISC German  ] citizen [PER Haled El Masri  ] . 
Press reports indicate that [MISC German  ] investigators obtained the 13 names from the [ORG Spanish Civil Guard  ] on September 27 , 2006 during a visit to [LOC Spain  ] by [LOC Munich  ] prosecutor [PER Martin Hoffman  ] . 
The names had been included in a 2005 report ordered by a prosecutor in [LOC Palma de Mallorca  ] . 
Some press reports indicated that while the names were presumed to be false , the [ORG Civil Guard  ] had obtained photographs of at least three of the individuals from hotel records in [LOC Palma  ] . 
It appears that [MISC Spanish  ] daily " [ORG El Pais  ] " also shared some of the names and other information it had gathered with [MISC German  ] [ORG MADRID  ] 00000173 003.2 OF 003 investigators. //COMMENT// <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Despite the absence of evidence of a crime , or even of a clear direction in the [ORG National Court  ] 's [ORG CIA  ] flights investigation , it is clear that the plaintiffs ( which in [LOC Spain  ] now include attorneys from the extreme left wing [LOC United Left  ] ) plan to keep this issue on the front burner . 
However , the most worrisome element of this episode is the joint timing of the announcemnts by the [MISC German  ] prosecutors and Examining Magistrate in the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG CIA  ] flights investigation , timing that suggests that they are coordinating to advance the cases in their respective jurisdictions . 
This coordination among independent investigators will complicate our efforts to manage this case at a discreet government-to-government level . 
With regard to the internal political dynamics on this issue , both major parties will be at pains to demonstrate their commitment to the rule of law . 
In spite of its general pro-U.S. orientation , our experience suggests that the [ORG PP  ] will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the [ORG Zapatero Government  ] tolerated or deliberately ignored [ORG USG  ] actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations , even if these revelations reflect badly on the [ORG USG  ] .
