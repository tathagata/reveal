( [ORG SBU  ] ) According to international organizations working in [LOC Libya  ] on TIP-related programs , [LOC Libya  ] is primarily a transit country for TIP victims . 
[LOC Libya  ] currently has no legal or regulatory framework to separate victims of trafficking from the general migrant population . 
However , the [ORG GOL  ] has taken steps , largely through its work with international organizations , to review the current law to include provisions specifically related to criminalizing all forms of trafficking . 
A joint program recently conducted by the [ORG International Organization for Migration  ] ( [ORG IOM  ] ) and the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] ( [ORG MOJ  ] ) included an assessment of the current [MISC Libyan  ] legal framework as it relates to irregular migration and TIP in particular . 
At the end of the program in October 2009 , the [MISC Libyan  ] participants -- a collection of 60 judges and prosecutors -- produced recommendations to amend national legislation in order to strengthen prosecution sanctions for traffickers and smugglers , as well as to include protection and assistance measures for both trafficked victims and smuggled migrants . 
The [ORG IOM  ] , pending renewed assistance from the [MISC Libyan  ] , [LOC US  ] , and [ORG EU  ] governments , plans to continue its cooperation with the [ORG MOJ  ] , with the goal of supporting the actual implementation of a new article in the [MISC Libyan  ] criminal code . 
2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) During the last year , the [ORG GOL  ] has made significant advances in its efforts to combat TIP , to punish human traffickers and smugglers , and to address the needs of TIP victims . 
The [ORG Ministries of Justice  ] and [ORG Internal Security  ] have made concerted efforts to respond to and prosecute human traffickers , drawing on elements of [LOC Libya  ] 's existing criminal code . 
International organizations note that the [ORG GOL  ] views TIP largely as a security issue and has focused on prosecuting traffickers rather than responding to victims . 
[LOC Libya  ] has expanded its support for TIP-related training and awareness-building programs for law enforcement officials , judges , and prosecutors . 
During the year , in cooperation with the [ORG IOM  ] , the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] supported the training of judges and prosecutors from throughout [LOC Libya  ] for the purpose of raising awareness on the main features and characteristics of TIP as a phenomenon distinct from other forms of migration . 
International organizations report that individual officials are receptive and eager for new information and training , but that [LOC Libya  ] lacks an institutional or cultural awareness of trafficking . 
The [ORG IOM  ] cooperation is designed to build capacity within the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Ministries of Justice  ] and Interior and to encourage better communication between those two bodies in order to improve the [ORG GOL  ] 's ability to respond to TIP . 
3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG GOL  ] has also supported the cooperative work of international organizations with quasi-governmental organizations , such as the [MISC World Islamic Call Society  ] ( [ORG WICS  ] ) , to provide religious counsel , and medical , legal and psychological support to victims of trafficking . 
The [ORG GOL  ] continues to allow outside groups ( international and quasi-governmental associations ) to provide targeted assistance for migrants -- including victims of trafficking -- held in detention . 
[ORG GOL  ] officials allow international organizations to have informal access to victims of trafficking held in detention on a case-by-case basis , and to provide some protective services to those individuals . 
4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG GOL  ] officials have expressed support for awareness-raising programs through the media and quasi-governmental organizations . 
The programs would be designed to enlighten the migrant population about the risks linked to irregular migration and underline the inhumane means and methods of criminal organizations involved in this activity . 
5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Continued training is necessary to ensure that both effective and systematic identification procedures of TIP victims are developed and that protective services can be offered on a regular basis . 
Individual [MISC Libyan  ] officials and members of [MISC Libyan  ] quasi-governmental organizations have expressed interest in receiving more TIP-related training . 
The [ORG GOL  ] has been supportive of [LOC US  ] and [ORG EU  ] assistance on such programs and has indicated a willingness to continue its active engagement in this area .
