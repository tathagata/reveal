07 [ORG MAPUTO  ] 1395 [ORG MAPUTO  ] 00000086 001.2 OF 003 Classified [ORG By: Charge  ] d'Affaires [PER Todd Chapman  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b+d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG SUMMARY: The Charge  ] recently met with XXXXXXXXXXXX -- ( " the source " ) who described his frustrations with [MISC FRELIMO  ] , President [PER Guebuza  ] , and [ORG Mohamed Bashir  ] Suleiman ( [ORG MBS  ] ) . 
He complained that they exercise complete control over the licit and illicit economy of [LOC Mozambique  ] . 
The source , who has excellent connections within the Government of [LOC Mozambique  ] ( [ORG GRM  ] ) , including the private number of the President , as well as a personal relationship with [ORG MBS  ] , said " I do not want to do business anymore in [LOC Mozambique  ] “ because of this triumverate of control . 
He is liquidating his assets and leaving [LOC Mozambique  ] , and says that he now sees the " malaise " in [LOC Mozambique  ] as if " he had cataracts but now see it all . 
" <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The source describes President [PER Guebuza  ] , who he has known and befriended for the past twenty years as a " vicious scorpion who will sting you , " and has an even more grav assessment of [ORG MBS  ] . 
He cautions that [MISC FRELIMO  ] is not interested in bettering the life of [LOC Mozambique  ] 's citizens , but rather its self-enrichment . 
In the licit economy , the ruling party , [MISC FRELIMO  ] , and [ORG MBS  ] work in tandem to control the legal and illegal economies and restrict the space for private sector growth by demanding a cut of all significant business transactions . 
In the illicit economy , [ORG MBS  ] dominates money laundering and drug transshipment , providing kickbacks to [MISC FRELIMO  ] . 
Other key players involved in pressuring the business community for bribes or percentage stakes , according to the source , are [PER Domingos Tivane  ] , head of Customs , and former Prime Minister [PER Luisa Diogo  ] . 
END SUMMARY. ----------------------------------- [PER MOHAMED BASHIR SULEIMAN  ] AND [PER GUEBUZA  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The source XXXXXXXXXXXX . 
He speculated that over the next term [PER Guebuza  ] would use his business proxies to amass a still larger personal fortune . 
[PER Guebuza  ] manages his business interests through several front companies , including [PER Celso Ismael Correia  ] 's Insitec and [PER Salimo Abdullah  ] 's [ORG Intelec Holdings  ] . 
The source said that [ORG MBS  ] meets directly with President [PER Guebuza  ] , who has direct knowledge of [LOC MBS'  ] funding to both the [MISC FRELIMO  ] party ( underwriting the recent election campaign ) and [PER Guebuza  ] 's front companies . 
The source , who described [PER Correia  ] as a " 30 year-old pipsqueak , " stated that [PER Correia  ] has no business experience or university degree , but shows great loyalty to [PER Guebuza.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Guebuza  ] 's business interests in [LOC Mozambique  ] are legion . 
They include stakes in [PER Mocambique Gestores  ] ( [ORG MG  ] ) , [ORG Maputo Port Development Company  ] ( [ORG MPDC  ] ) which runs [LOC Maputo Port  ] , Focus 21 , Navique , [ORG Vodacom  ] , and [ORG SASOL  ] . 
[PER Guebuza  ] also has a share in [ORG Maputo Corridor Logistics Initiative  ] ( [ORG MCLI  ] ) which controls the toll road from [LOC Maputo  ] to [LOC South Africa  ] , according to the source . 
[PER Guebuza  ] has shares in a significant number of banks , including [ORG BCI Fomento  ] ( where [PER Correia  ] is Chairman ) , [LOC Mocambique Capitais  ] , [PER Moza Banco  ] , and Geocapital . 
Through family members , [PER Guebuza  ] also controls [ORG Intelec Business Advisory and Consulting  ] , [ORG Beira Grain Terminal  ] , [ORG MBT Construction Ltd  ] , [ORG Englob Consultants Ltd  ] , [ORG Mozambique Power Industries  ] , [ORG Macequece Ltd  ] , and [ORG Mozambique Natural Resources Corp.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) One new area that [PER Guebuza  ] appears to be interested in is the gaming industry . 
The source says that [PER Guebuza  ] forced the [ORG Constitutional Council  ] ( [ORG CC  ] ) to review and declare a recent law liberalizing the gaming industry as " constitutional " even though it calls for all casino assets to revert to the state after a defined period of time , in direct contravention of private property laws enshrined in the [LOC Constitution  ] . 
The judges of the [ORG CC  ] , who also ruled in favor of decisions during the elections to invalidate large numbers of opposition candidates in the legislative and presidential races , complained of the unconstitutionality of the new law , but were told to give it a favorable ruling , which they did. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The source elaborated on the depth of [PER Guebuza  ] 's business interests , which range across the economy . 
He said [ORG MAPUTO  ] 00000086 002.2 OF 003 that [PER Guebuza  ] is in on almost all of the " mega-project " multi-million dollar deals via contractual stipulations to work with the [MISC Mozambican  ] private sector . 
One example is [PER Guebuza  ] 's involvement in the 2007 purchase of [LOC Cahora Bassa  ] Hydroelectric Dam ( HCB ) from the [MISC Portuguese  ] Government for $950 million. $700 million of this was paid by a private consortium of banks , which was arranged by a [PER Guebuza  ] proxy , for which [PER Guebuza  ] received , while he was a sitting president , an estimated commission of between $35 and $50 million . 
The [MISC Portuguese  ] bank which arranged the financing turned over its shares in [ORG BCI Fomento  ] , one of the largest [MISC Mozambican  ] commercial banks , to a [MISC Guebuza-controlled  ] company. --------------- [ORG MBS  ] AND [MISC FRELIMO  ] --------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The source , says that [MISC FRELIMO  ] brazenly squeezes the business community for kickbacks . 
As an example , the source said that he has personally seen [PER Manuel Tome  ] , former [MISC FRELIMO  ] Secretary General , senior member of the [ORG National Assembly  ] , and relative of President [PER Chissano  ] , in [LOC MBS'  ] office receiving pay-offs quite openly . 
Head of Customs [PER Domingos Tivane  ] openly demands and receives payoffs from importers , including [ORG MBS  ] . 
The source stated that one business contact remarked to him that when visiting [PER Tivane  ] 's expansive home to deliver a bribe he noticed that the bureaucrat had solid gold fixtures in his bathroom . 
The source also stated that former Prime Minister [PER Luisa Diogo  ] , until she was removed from the [ORG Cabinet  ] ( septel ) , was heavily involved in taking bribes for [MISC FRELIMO  ] , of which she kept a percentage . 
Similar allegations were raised in the 21 January issue of [LOC Zambeze  ] , regarding soft loans paid to [PER Diogo  ] 's husband [PER Albano Silva  ] , purchases of houses and buildings for a fraction of their value , as well as [PER Diogo  ] 's close ties to officials such as [PER Diodino Cambaza  ] , whose corruption trial is ongoing. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) At the ports , the source commented that [MISC FRELIMO  ] has its own clearing agent that handles [MISC FRELIMO  ] and [ORG MBS  ] business . 
The clearing agent chronically under-invoices items , avoids the 17% VAT , and also has an arrangement with [PER Tivane  ] 's Customs authorities to bypass the ports' mandatory scanning . 
The source has documentary proof of the under-invoicing by [ORG MBS  ] , and poloff has seen MBS' trucks drive through the port without being scanned . 
Nonetheless , the source said that Government of [LOC Mozambique  ] ( [ORG GRM  ] ) officials routinely describe [ORG MBS  ] as an " untouchable " due to his connections to [PER Tivane  ] and [PER Guebuza  ] , a situation which is reported to irk a cash-strapped [ORG Tax Authority  ] ( AT ) President [PER Rosario Fernandes.  ] ------------------------- [ORG MBS  ] AND OTHER BUSINESSMEN ------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Regarding MBS' retail operation , the source states that [ORG MBS  ] does not tolerate competition . 
The source 's milk processing facility was threatened by [ORG MBS  ] who used VAT-avoidance and under-invoicing to dump vast quantities of imported condensed milk on the market in order to put the source out of business . 
Only after the source made an agreement with [ORG MBS  ] for exclusive distribution of his milk products , with a 10% kickback on all sales to [ORG MBS  ] , did [ORG MBS  ] stop his dumping practices . 
Other businessmen have complained about similar practices in other commodities to include edible oil . 
The source complained that " even those who bribe " [ORG MBS  ] or [MISC FRELIMO  ] cannot make a profit under such conditions. ------------------------------ NARCOTICS AND MONEY LAUNDERING ------------------------------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The source says he only has second hand knowledge of drug trafficking and money laundering in [LOC Mozambique  ] . 
He said that " [ORG MBS  ] and the 'Nacala dealers' all have offices in [LOC Dubai  ] " to facilitate money laundering operations in [LOC Mozambique  ] . 
It is through these operations that after 15 years in business in [LOC Mozambique  ] , [ORG MBS  ] was able to pay $30 million in cash to establish his shopping plaza downtown , [ORG Maputo Shopping  ] , which opened in 2007 . 
The source said that he asked prominent [PER Ismaili/Aga Khan  ] businessman [PER Mustaque Ali  ] how [ORG MBS  ] became so rich so fast , and [PER Ali  ] 's wry answer was " [PER Johnson  ] 's baby powder , " a euphemism for drugs . 
The source noted that the sometimes erratic changes in [ORG MAPUTO  ] 00000086 003.2 OF 003 [LOC Mozambique  ] 's foreign exchange position are due to sudden multi-million dollar transfers of cash overseas tied to money laundering . 
The source commented that in the past few years there have been several embarrassing situations in which shiploads of drugs , primarily hashish and heroin have washed ashore ; however , the media is usually afraid to report on such incidents because no one wants to become another [PER Carlos Cardoso  ] , the courageous [MISC Mozambican  ] journalist who was murdered in 2000 while investigating a massive bank fraud tied to then-President [PER Chissano  ] 's family. --------------------------------------------- COMMENT: CANDID COMMENTS FROM A CONNECTED MAN --------------------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The source , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] While he has an axe to grind because he is frustrated with the scope and depth of corruption in [LOC Mozambique  ] , his statements corroborate what we have learned from other sources ( Ref A ) . 
Ties with [ORG MBS  ] and other known money launders and narcotraffickers by senior [ORG GRM  ] officials are disturbing and demonstrate a short-sighted focus on self-enrichment . 
The source cautions against building long term relationships with [MISC FRELIMO  ] , and fears that , having allowed the illicit economy to prosper , and having advertised [LOC Mozambique  ] as a money laundering destination and drug transshipment hotspot , the ruling party will no longer be able to control the nefarious activities within its borders . 
Rumors and stories of corruption abound in [LOC Mozambique  ] , but rarely will a successful well-connected [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] be willing to share specific practices based on first-hand knowledge and participation in these practices .
