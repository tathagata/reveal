MOD: GOOD COOPERATION BETWEEN FORCES , HOPE FOR MORE <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Charge d'Affaires , accompanied by the [ORG Defense Attache  ] , [ORG Military Liaison Office  ] Chief and [ORG Air Attache  ] , met with [PER Prado Maia  ] ( the equivalent in [LOC Brazil  ] of the [LOC U.S.  ] Chairman of the [ORG Joint Chiefs of Staff  ] ) to discuss [MISC Brazilian  ] and [LOC United States  ] cooperative efforts in the ongoing post-earthquake [MISC Haitian  ] humanitarian crisis . 
After receiving [LOC U.S.  ] official condolences for the loss of [MISC Brazilian  ] civilian , diplomatic , and military lives as a result of the earthquake , [PER Prado Maia  ] thanked the [LOC United States  ] for its cooperation with [ORG MINUSTAH  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] . 
According to [PER Prado Maia  ] , in a video teleconference held on January 20 with the " [ORG Crisis Cabinet  ] " stood up by President [PER Lula  ] specifically for the [LOC Haiti  ] crisis , [ORG MINUSTAH  ] Commander Lieutenant General [PER Floriano Peixoto  ] was effusive in his praise of [LOC U.S.  ] cooperation with [ORG MINUSTAH  ] and [MISC Brazilian  ] forces , as well as of his personal relationship with Lieutenant General [PER Keen  ] . 
[PER Peixoto  ] had said that coordination and cooperation were going extremely well under very trying circumstances . 
[PER Prado Maia  ] thanked the [LOC United States  ] for our efforts to reach out and cooperate with [ORG MINUSTAH  ] and [PER Peixoto  ] . 
He pointed out that the press was making much of supposed friction between our two forces , but that was clearly untrue , according to [LOC Peixoto.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Prado Maia  ] said [LOC Brazil  ] would be replacing its contingent in [LOC Haiti  ] - despite [ORG UN  ] objections - starting this weekend , albeit eight days later than originally planned because of the earthquake . 
He did not see this as a problem given the [MISC Brazilian  ] military extensively prepares its troops prior to deployment for duty in [ORG MINUSTAH  ] . 
He added that the [MISC Brazilian  ] Navy , slow to get into the fray , was sending a medical surgical team and one SUPER PUMA cargo helicopter to [LOC Haiti  ] on an [ORG Italian Aircraft Carrier  ] passing through [MISC Brazilian  ] waters next week en route to [LOC Haiti  ] . 
Finally , [PER Prado Maia  ] closed by expressing the desire of the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Defense Ministry  ] and [ORG Armed Forces  ] to coordinate and cooperate more in [LOC Haiti  ] with the [LOC United States  ] as each country built up forces to assist the [LOC Haitians.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Charge , DATT , and MLO Chief briefed [PER Prado Maia  ] on the possibilities and benefits of signing an Acquisition and [ORG Cross-Servicing Agreement  ] ( [ORG ACSA  ] ) to facilitate logistics for the mission in [LOC Haiti  ] . 
[PER Prado Maia  ] expressed interest in learning more and speculated that the [MISC Crisis Cabinet  ] , on which he holds a seat , might be a good venue to fast track the agreement if both sides could settle the language . 
( [ORG Note: Post  ] has a boiler-plate of the [ORG ACSA  ] in [MISC Portuguese  ] and will get it over to [PER Prado Maia  ] first thing next week . 
End note . 
) MRE: NO CONFLICT , BUT MORE COMMUNICATION IMPORTANT <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Charge , accompanied by [ORG POLCOUNS  ] , began her discussion of [LOC Haiti  ] with [PER Simoes  ] by delivering points ref A regarding the importance of following [ORG ICAO  ] procedures in requesting slots at [LOC Port-au-Prince  ] airport , and encouraged [PER Simoes  ] to come directly to her ( or to [ORG POLCOUNS  ] as back-up ) regarding any VIP visitors so she could ensure appropriate handling . 
[PER Simoes  ] said he understood , and would seek to ensure the protocols were followed even as he gave a " heads up " to her on critical flights. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Simoes  ] said he sees in the [LOC Haiti  ] relief effort an opportunity to further improve [MISC U.S.-Brazilian  ] cooperation , and noted he had said as much in a recent television interview . 
" We must seize the opportunity , " he said , stressing that [LOC Brazil  ] " is not competing with the [LOC United States  ] " and is very happy with [ORG U.S. BRASILIA  ] 00000019 002 OF 002 efforts . 
He noted , however , that the media and certain countries in the region ( he mentioned [LOC Venezuela  ] , [LOC Ecuador  ] , and [LOC Bolivia  ] ) were seeking to exploit the [LOC U.S.  ] presence and small incidents to create conflict between us. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) To manage the regional and media perceptions better , [PER Simoes  ] stressed the need for " increased channels of communication " so that neither [LOC Brazil  ] nor [ORG MINUSTAH  ] will be surprised by [LOC U.S.  ] actions . 
He noted that the size and actions of the [LOC U.S.  ] contingent could create problems-he cited the rumors of a [LOC U.S.  ] occupation of [LOC Haiti  ] and the landing of a [LOC U.S.  ] helicopter on the lawn of the presidential palace as examples-and suggested that greater communication could have allowed [ORG MINUSTAH  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] to better support the [LOC U.S.  ] actions . 
[PER Simoes  ] suggested that having an official in State or the [LOC White House  ] designated to advise other active governments of [LOC U.S.  ] actions in and regarding [LOC Haiti  ] would be one way to improve communication . 
He also suggested that [ORG MINUSTAH  ] liaison officers with [LOC U.S.  ] forces-he specifically mentioned the [PER USS Carl Vinson-could  ] help . 
" The reason is not to change [LOC U.S.  ] plans , " he stressed , " but to help execute them successfully . 
" [PER LULA  ] RELEASES NEW MONIES TO SUPPORT GOB EFFORTS <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( SBU ) In advance of the [ORG Montreal Foreign Ministers  ] meeting , President [PER Lula  ] made available late on January 21 R$375 million ( approximately [MISC US$  ] 208 million ) to support [ORG MOD  ] , [ORG MRE  ] , and the [ORG Ministry of Health  ] ( [ORG MOH  ] ) efforts regarding [LOC Haiti  ] . 
This includes the [MISC US$15  ] million already announced by [ORG MRE  ] for relief supplies . 
R$135 million ( approximately [MISC US$75  ] million ) will go to [ORG MOH  ] for ten Immediate Care Units and the acquisition of fifty ambulances . 
R$205 million ( approximately [MISC US$114  ] million ) will go to [ORG MOD  ] to support the [MISC Brazilian  ] troop presence . 
[PER Lula  ] has also decided to increase [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG MINUSTAH  ] contingent by 900 troops , with an additional reserve of 400 troops-up to double its current forces in [ORG MINUSTAH  ] . 
[PER Simoes  ] said the [ORG Montreal Foreign Ministers  ] meeting would be a good opportunity to demonstrate the multilateral nature of efforts in [LOC Haiti  ] . 
He suggested there should be a [MISC European  ] presence , as well ; " we need to open it up and encourage others to get involved , " he said . 
COMMENT: DESIRE FOR MORE COORDINATION BEHIND THE SMILES <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The meetings between the Charge and both [PER Prado Maia  ] and [PER Simoes  ] were friendly and productive , much like those she has held with other senior GOB officials this week ( ref B ) . 
Both were open to forwarding our relationship and sought to be helpful in offering suggestions . 
Clearly , we have turned a corner on the earlier friction caused by coordination problems at the [LOC Port-au-Prince  ] airport , and the GOB is determined to see this as an opportunity both to increase cooperation with the [ORG USG  ] and to enhance its own leadership standing . 
At the same time , the desire for greater communication by the [ORG USG  ] with [ORG MINUSTAH  ] , in the first instance , and the GOB in the second , is clear. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Heading into the [LOC Montreal  ] meeting , [LOC Brazil  ] believes it has earned , through its long-term commitment to leading [ORG MINUSTAH  ] and its mounting efforts to [LOC Haiti  ] in the wake of the earthquake , the right to full partnership in the relief and reconstruction of [LOC Haiti  ] going forward . 
The feeling seems to persist that the [ORG USG  ] is not treating [LOC Brazil  ] in that way . 
Continued [ORG USG  ] acknowledgment of [LOC Brazil  ] 's leadership in [LOC Haiti  ] and a commitment to communication and coordination will go a long way toward ensuring GOB support for [ORG USG  ] efforts .
