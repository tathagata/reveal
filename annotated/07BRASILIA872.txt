( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary . 
The [ORG Brazilian Democratic Movement Party  ] ( [ORG PMDB  ] ) leadership used a threat of non-cooperation with the government in the [ORG Chamber of Deputies'  ] just-created [ORG Parliamentary Inquiry Committee  ] ( [ORG CPI  ] ) on the [ORG Air Traffic Crisis  ] to pressure the [PER Lula  ] administration for jobs in the second tier of government . 
The [ORG PMDB  ] leadership had threatened to place four deputies on the [MISC CPI  ] who could be counted on to work against the government 's position . 
The threat did not work , and the party appears to have retreated from linking its role in the [MISC CPI  ] to political spoils . 
With the jobs issue still unresolved , about a third of the ninety-some [ORG PMDB Federal Deputies  ] are threatening obstruction in the [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] in order to pressure the government for jobs . 
But the deputies are not going to try to achieve their goals by manipulating the [MISC CPI  ] , group spokesman Federal Deputy [PER Eduardo Cunha  ] ( [ORG PMDB  ] , [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] ) said , according to a May 15 Correio Braziliense story . 
The [ORG PMDB  ] 's threat to politicize the [MISC CPI  ] had strengthened the likelihood , still present , that the [MISC CPI  ] 's conclusions could be a whitewash that blames [MISC American  ] pilots for last September 's midair collision between an [MISC Embraer Legacy  ] jet and Gol flight 1907 , resulting in [LOC Brazil  ] 's worst commercial air disaster and the loss of 154 lives . 
That scenario seems less likely than at the end of last week , but we will not know for sure for some time . 
The episode serves as a reminder that most of the [ORG PMDB  ] is a non-ideological , spoils-oriented organization that places its own interests first . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On May 10 the [MISC CPI  ] ordered the [MISC American  ] pilots of the [MISC Embraer Legacy  ] jet to provide testimony . 
Their [MISC Brazilian  ] lawyer already has stated that the pilots are unlikely to return from the [LOC U.S.  ] simply to testify before a [MISC CPI  ] ; they are also under indictment here . 
As it investigates the causes of the [MISC Legacy/Gol  ] crash , the [MISC CPI  ] could opt not to delve deeply into alleged failings in [MISC Brazilian  ] air traffic control , and in its conclusions blame the accident entirely on the [MISC American  ] pilots . 
This scenario would leave [PER Lula  ] 's image relatively unscathed . 
In a scenario less favorable to [PER Lula  ] , the [MISC CPI  ] would embarrass the government by revealing mismanagement of air traffic control and airports . 
While the position of other coalition deputies is probably predictably in line with a government attempt to control damage , the same cannot yet be said of the [ORG PMDB  ] deputies . 
Opposition deputies will probably try to reveal as much information as possible that could damage the [PER Lula  ] administration . 
Whether the [MISC CPI  ] attributes all blame for the accident to the [MISC Americans  ] or also blames [MISC Brazilians  ] could depend in part on what , if any , instructions the [ORG PMDB  ] deputies receive from their party leadership . 
[ORG PMDB  ] Wants Top Jobs in Second Tier ; Threatened Non-Cooperation in [MISC CPI  ] ----------------------------------- --------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) According to press reports and an informed congressman who discussed the issue with poloff , the [ORG PMDB  ] leadership threatened the [PER Lula  ] administration with an uncooperative stance in the [MISC CPI  ] . 
This could increase the [MISC CPI  ] 's damage to the government if it does not meet the [ORG PMDB  ] 's demands for second-tier federal jobs . 
The [ORG PMDB  ] recently parlayed its good showing at the polls last October into a [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000872 002 OF 003 hefty increase from two seats to five at the Cabinet table , and is now seeking to increase its control over more posts and resources . 
There are dozens of second-tier directorships at stake , including public utilities , transportation , financial bodies , public infrastructure , and other government organizations . 
In turn , the new directors can create a cascade of spoils by appointing party cronies as managers deep down into the organizations , affecting thousands of jobs . 
According to the April 16 , 2007 , edition of [LOC Epoca  ] magazine , there are 24,000 such jobs ( cargos comissionados ) in the federal government . 
Congressman: [ORG PMDB Tried  ] to " [MISC Extort  ] " Government ------------ --------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Federal Deputy [PER Raul Henry  ] ( [ORG PMDB , Pernambuco )  ] ( protect ) , one of a handful of [ORG PMDB  ] deputies who usually votes against his party and with the opposition , told poloff on May 10 that the [ORG PMDB  ] leadership attempted " extortion " to achieve its goals . 
[ORG PMDB President  ] [PER Michel Temer  ] , a Federal Deputy from [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , and [ORG PMDB Chamber  ] leader [PER Henrique Eduardo Alves  ] , from [LOC Rio Grande  ] do [LOC Norte  ] , offered the government two slates of deputies for the [MISC CPI  ] on the [ORG Air Traffic Crisis  ] , a " hard " one and a " soft " one . 
The hard slate was composed of deputies who could be relied upon to take their investigatory duties seriously and go rough on the government . 
The soft slate was composed of yes-men who would go along with the government 's damage control efforts . 
If the government did not accede to [ORG PMDB  ] demands for second-tier jobs , [PER Henry  ] said , the [ORG PMDB  ] would install its hard slate in the [MISC CPI  ] . 
As it turned out , though , after a [ORG Supreme Court  ] ruling that ordered the Chamber to establish the [MISC CPI  ] , the [MISC CPI  ] started its work before the second-tier jobs issue was resolved . 
The [ORG PMDB  ] was prematurely forced to decide which slate it would put forward . 
[PER Henry  ] said the [ORG PMDB  ] leaders opted for the soft slate , probably in anticipation that it would increase the party 's chances of doing well in the appointments process . 
Putting forward the hard slate would have been counterproductive , effectively punishing the government in advance when the jobs outcome was still unknown . 
With the jobs issue still unresolved but the soft slate installed , the [ORG PMDB  ] was threatening rebellion in the [MISC CPI  ] if its demands were not satisfied , according to press reports on May 11 . 
( Note: The [ORG PMDB  ] was already dissatisfied , as a Chamber vote this week on federal funds for cities revealed ; this threat raised the ante for the government . 
) By May 15 the situation appeared different: Federal Deputy [PER Eduardo Cunha  ] , a spokesman for [ORG PMDB  ] deputies threatening obstruction , said the party would not force the jobs issue through the [MISC CPI  ] . 
On May 15 poloff checked this with [PER Nivaldo Ferreira  ] , a adviser in the [ORG PMDB  ] 's offices in the [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] . 
He said the pressure for federal jobs comes both from the leadership as well as the backbench deputies , but the party will not condition its behavior in the [MISC CPI  ] on jobs , adding that the [ORG PMDB  ] supports the government and will be responsive to it . 
Government Deputies on [MISC CPI  ] Will Try to [MISC Divert Attention from Real  ] Shortcomings -------------------------------------- --------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Still , the [ORG PMDB  ] 's threats could yield fruit because the government is vulnerable to damage by the [MISC CPI  ] 's findings , and [ORG PMDB  ] bad behavior would be harmful . 
One way for the government to minimize the public and institutional damage is to blame others . 
Jornal do [LOC Brasil  ] political columnist [PER Anna Ramalho  ] pointed this out on May 14 . 
She said government deputies on the [MISC CPI  ] are trying to focus the [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000872 003 OF 003 investigation of the [ORG Gol  ] crash on the [MISC American  ] pilots in order to divert attention from shortcomings in the [MISC Brazilian  ] air traffic control system , which falls under the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Air Force.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) Government coalition deputies hold 16 seats on the [MISC CPI  ] , and the opposition holds eight . 
The [ORG PMDB  ] holds the chairmanship , and three seats on the 24-member committee . 
The chairman may vote only to break a tie . 
The [ORG Workers Party  ] ( [ORG PT  ] ) , the party of president [PER Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  ] , holds four seats , including the critical role of rapporteur . 
[ORG Senate  ] to [ORG Open Own Air Traffic Investigation  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) On the other side of [ORG Congress  ] , the [ORG Senate  ] is preparing to open its own [MISC CPI  ] into the air traffic crisis . 
Poloff spoke with Senator [PER Sergio Guerra  ] ( [MISC Brazilian  ] Social [ORG Democracy Party  ] , [ORG Pernambuco  ] ) ( protect ) on May 10 . 
Asked about his expectations of the [ORG Senate  ] 's [MISC CPI  ] , [PER Guerra  ] said only that " the [MISC CPI  ] should not be an anti-corruption [MISC CPI  ] . 
" He felt it should focus on the specific problems affecting air traffic , although it may discover corruption in process . 
He did not comment on a possible [ORG Senate  ] [MISC CPI  ] interest in the role of the [MISC American  ] pilots . 
( Note: Ref B reported a Federal Deputy 's expectation that corruption would be a major focus of an air traffic [MISC CPI  ] . 
) Another leading opposition figure , Senator [PER Antonio Carlos Magalhaes  ] ( [MISC Democrats  ] , [LOC Bahia  ] ) , was probably alluding to the [ORG PMDB  ] 's tactics when he said in the plenary on May 14 that the [ORG Senate  ] 's [MISC CPI  ] will be " serious and impartial " because the [ORG Senators  ] do not want to " trade their consciences for emoluments from the government . 
" He insisted that the [ORG Senate  ] [MISC CPI  ] must not spare from scrutiny the [ORG National Civil Aviation Agency  ] ( [ORG ANAC  ] ) , the airports administration ( [LOC Infraero  ] ) , the [ORG Air Force  ] , or the airlines. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG Comment:  ] The [ORG PMDB  ] leadership 's pressure tactics reconfirm the party 's strong tendency to put its own welfare above ideology or the national interest . 
This is business as usual for the [ORG PMDB  ] and a number of other non-ideological parties . 
Although [PER Lula  ] arguably had no alternative , in acceding to [ORG PMDB  ] demands for a large role in the cabinet , he reinforced the spoils system and let the camel 's nose into the tent for his second term . 
As the largest party in both houses of [ORG Congress  ] , the [ORG PMDB  ] will probably offer more such examples of " extortion , " as Deputy [PER Henry  ] put it , trying the government 's patience and reinforcing the system . 
If it is true the [ORG PMDB  ] has backed away from conditioning its deputies' behavior in the [MISC CPI  ] on spoils at the federal trough , we may have had a " near miss " that could have been unfair to the [MISC American  ] pilots . 
Regardless , the [ORG PMDB  ] 's attempted politicization of the [MISC CPI  ] bodes ill for a dispassionate rendering of the facts in the Legacy/Gol 1907 crash .
