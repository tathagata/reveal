( C ) [MISC SUMMARY: Considered  ] " a love fest " by the MFA , the growing [MISC Franco-Brazilian  ] relationship under Presidents [PER Sarkozy  ] and [PER Lula  ] is likely to result in more political , diplomatic , economic , and military engagement in the next three years and throughout [PER Sarkozy  ] 's time in office . 
Committed to expanding [LOC France  ] 's role as a global player , [PER Sarkozy  ] is preparing for the [MISC French  ] [ORG G-8  ] and [MISC G-20  ] presidency in 2011 with a foreign policy of reaching out to emerging powers in an effort to promote [LOC France  ] 's international clout . 
His direct involvement in the not yet concluded [MISC Rafale  ] fighter jet sale to [LOC Brazil  ] highlights his use of his personal ties with [PER Lula  ] to persistently court the regional giant and will serve as a model of [MISC French  ] entree into [LOC Latin America  ] and beyond . 
In [LOC Paris  ] on November 14 , [PER Lula  ] and [PER Sarkozy  ] met to address climate change issues which included an announcement that [PER Sarkozy  ] will travel to [LOC Latin America  ] next week which we view as a continuation of the [MISC French  ] President , s charm offensive . 
Septels will address economic and environmental aspects of this bilateral relationship . 
Post welcomes Embassy [LOC Brasilia  ] 's comments on this assessment . 
END SUMMARY . 
MOBILIZING THE EMERGING POWERS ------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Highly encouraged by the growing importance of the [MISC G-20  ] precipitated by the economic crisis , President [PER Nicholas Sarkozy  ] is recalibrating his policies by increasingly courting populous , non-aligned states in the hopes of extending [MISC French  ] international influence . 
Ahead of assuming both the [ORG G-8  ] and [MISC G-20  ] presidency in 2011 , [PER Sarkozy  ] has been wooing what he calls " countries which are bridgeheads , " or states with which [LOC France  ] has traditionally not had a close relationship , and forming a body of allies that will help the [ORG GOF  ] refashion its image as a key leader in a multi-polar world . 
( See septel on economic and [MISC G-20  ] issues . 
) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In his August 26 annual address to [MISC French  ] diplomats , [PER Sarkozy  ] declared that the [ORG G-8  ] should be expanded to include [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC China  ] , [LOC India  ] , [LOC Mexico  ] , [LOC South Africa  ] , and [LOC Egypt  ] to form the [MISC G-14  ] , or what he has dubbed with [PER Lula  ] as the &Alliance for Change , 8 promising to implement the change during the [MISC French  ] [ORG G-8  ] presidency . 
Even before becoming President , he has demonstrated a policy of actively pursuing the potential six new members of the [MISC G-14  ] formation , starting with [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Employing multi-billion dollar military and civilian trade deals as his calling card , [PER Sarkozy  ] has successfully managed to forge extremely close ties with [LOC Brazil  ] in the past two years , picking up from where his predecessor [PER Chirac  ] left off in a previous attempt to woo the world , s fifth most populous nation of 200 million . 
LIKE " LOOKING IN THE MIRROR " ---------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Having first met in 2007 , [MISC Brazilian  ] embassy contacts in [LOC Paris  ] described the initial bilateral meeting as the " start of the love affair " where [PER Sarkozy  ] and [PER Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  ] discovered that they shared " a vision of a new multilateralism " in global governance and the view of [LOC Brazil  ] as a vast market and regional platform for [LOC France  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] has often remarked that the two agree on a " near totality of issues , " including economic recovery , climate change , and security . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] diplomats noted that the two men have very similar personalities and that [PER Lula  ] has often commented that looking at [PER Sarkozy  ] is like " looking in the mirror . 
" The two leaders have put an emphasis on their warm personal chemistry and [LOC France  ] 's status as the only [LOC EU  ] country sharing a border with [LOC Brazil  ] , with [LOC French Guiana  ] located just north of [LOC South America  ] 's largest country . 
The " unique " bilateral partnership and close friendship between the energetic [PER Sarkozy  ] and the charismatic and popular [PER Lula  ] is of particular note given that the [MISC Brazilian  ] president does not speak [MISC English  ] or [MISC French  ] and the relationship is conducted almost exclusively through interpreters . 
Nonetheless , [MISC Brazilian  ] diplomats based in [LOC Paris  ] commented that the two men speak " a distinct common language " motivated by their drive to reshape the world order. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Explaining that [PER Chirac  ] was responsible for starting the strategic relationship with [LOC Brazil  ] based on the two countries' long history of common values , MFA Assistant Secretary for the [ORG Americas  ] [PER Elisabeth Beton-Delegue  ] echoed the [MISC Brazilians  ] on October 7 , calling the friendship between [PER Sarkozy  ] and [PER Lula  ] a real " love story " and noted that [LOC Brazil  ] represents one of [LOC France  ] 's diplomatic and commercial priorities in the [ORG Americas  ] under the current [MISC French  ] President . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] met with [PER Lula  ] four times in 2008 and has already held four bilateral meetings with his [MISC Brazilian  ] counterpart in 2009 . 
First Lady [PER Carla Bruni  ] did not participate in the [MISC French  ] President 's most recent trip to [LOC Brasilia  ] to the disappointment of the [MISC Brazilian  ] public , who reportedly greatly appreciate the fact that [LOC France  ] 's first couple often vacation in their country , according to the [MISC Brazilian  ] embassy in [LOC Paris  ] . 
Comment: We judge that [PER Sarkozy  ] takes full advantage of [PER Carla Bruni  ] , s individual popularity and their popularity as a couple to advance [MISC French  ] national interests in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[MISC FRANCO-BRAZILIAN  ] BILATERAL RELATIONS ------------------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The close relationship between [PER Sarkozy  ] and [PER Lula  ] grew from solid foundations . 
As [LOC France  ] 's leading trade partner in [LOC Latin America  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] hosts over 420 [MISC French  ] companies which employ approximately 400,000 people . 
[MISC French  ] exports totaled over $5 billion and [MISC Brazilian  ] exports to [LOC France  ] over $6 billion in 2008 . 
The [MISC Brazilians  ] have a well established military relationship with the [MISC French  ] that dates back to the mid-1980s , most recently including a $12 billion arms and technology transfer deal passed by the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Senate  ] on September 3 , in which [LOC France  ] will help [LOC Brasilia  ] establish their nascent nuclear submarine program , according to [MISC Brazilian  ] Embassy sources in [LOC Paris.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) In addition , [LOC Brazil  ] is [LOC France  ] 's leading regional partner for cultural , scientific , and technical cooperation . 
Three [MISC French  ] secondary schools in [LOC Sao Paolo  ] , [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] , and [LOC Brasilia  ] have a total of 2,200 students , half of which are [MISC French  ] nationals . 
Considered the most culturally influential foreign country by our [MISC Brazilian  ] diplomatic contacts , the [ORG Alliance Francaise in Brazil  ] constitutes the oldest and most extensive in the world , with 74 establishments in 52 towns . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is currently celebrating the " Year of [LOC France  ] , " with a series of cultural and cooperative events in commerce and technology to reciprocate the " Year of [LOC Brazil  ] " in [LOC France  ] in 2005 . 
Their embassy in [LOC Paris  ] noted that [LOC Brazil  ] is currently engaging in tri-lateral cooperation with the [MISC French  ] on agricultural projects in a host of [MISC African  ] countries ( [LOC Cameroon  ] , [LOC Mozambique  ] , [LOC Uganda  ] ) and are interested in developing their foreign policy initiatives in the region , as they have a large [MISC Afro-Brazilian  ] population . 
Further illustrating the strength of the existing [MISC Franco-Brazilian  ] ties , [LOC Paris  ] mayor [PER Bertrand Delanoe  ] was made an " honorary citizen " of the city of [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] on October 27 by his counterpart mayor , [PER Eduardor Paes  ] , after the two men signed an agreement focused on the revitalization and renovation of [LOC Rio  ] 's port areas . 
Both countries also shared recent grief over the loss of 228 people onboard [ORG Air France  ] Flight 447 in June , when the [MISC Airbus A330  ] disappeared over the [LOC Atlantic Ocean  ] during a [LOC Rio  ] de [MISC Janeiro-Paris  ] flight . 
Over 500 relatives of the victims and 40 members of [ORG Air France  ] held a memorial service on November 7 in [LOC Rio  ] , with junior [MISC French  ] minister [PER Alain Joyandet  ] , in charge of overseas cooperation , representing the [ORG GOF  ] . 
THE " [MISC F-X2  ] " PROJECT ------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [LOC Paris  ] used the positive political climate to try to position the [MISC Rafale  ] as the winner in the competition to equip the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Air Force  ] with new fighter aircraft , in the hopes of edging out the [MISC American  ] F/A-18 Super Hornet and the [MISC Swedish  ] Grippen . 
Politically motivated , the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] decision to publicly announce their intention to go with [MISC French  ] company [ORG Dassault  ] , which makes the [MISC Rafale  ] , over the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Air Force  ] 's preferred Super Hornet stemmed from [PER Lula  ] 's close relationship with [PER Sarkozy  ] . 
Although the deal known as " [MISC F-X2  ] " or the fleet expansion is still unsettled , the [MISC French  ] President did much to persuade his [MISC Brazilian  ] counterpart to lean toward the [MISC French-made  ] fighter jets in his two-day trip to [LOC Brasilia  ] , where he dined with [PER Lula  ] and was the special guest at [LOC Brazil  ] 's September 7 [MISC Independence Day  ] celebrations , which featured [MISC French  ] Foreign Legion troops and an over-flight of [MISC French  ] planes . 
In so doing , he attempted to demonstrate that his political ties with [PER Lula  ] are ultimately reinforced by industrial deals . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] presented the myth that [LOC France  ] is the perfect partner for states that do not want to rely on [LOC U.S.  ] technology , even though the [LOC U.S.  ] has agreed in principle to transfer relevant technology if [LOC Brazil  ] purchases the [MISC F-18  ] . 
However , if the [MISC Rafale  ] sale goes through , [ORG Dassault  ] may have to request export-control licenses from the [LOC U.S.  ] for parts built with [MISC American  ] technology . 
Although the [MISC F-X2  ] decision has yet to be confirmed by [LOC Brazil  ] , the [ORG GOF  ] appears confident that it has beaten out the [MISC American  ] and [MISC Swedish  ] competition thanks to [PER Sarkozy  ] 's diplomatic efforts . 
Moreover , [MISC Brazilian  ] poloff [PER Bruno de  ] [PER Lacerda Carrilho  ] in [LOC Paris  ] revealed on October 8 that [LOC Brasilia  ] has been particularly receptive to such personal engagement at the Presidential level by [LOC France  ] , posing the question of whether [MISC Obama  ] would become personally involved . 
Marking his fifth visit to [LOC Brazil  ] this year , [PER Sarkozy  ] is scheduled to travel to [LOC Manaus  ] on November 26 for the [ORG Summit of Amazon  ] countries and is expected to advance his broad political and commercial objectives with [LOC Brazil.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Leveraging his personal rapport with [PER Lula  ] to advance the bilateral relationship , [PER Sarkozy  ] depicted the union as " a balanced partnership with two legs , one civilian and the other military . 
The military has progressed faster but the civilian will eventually win out . 
" The two leaders have already signed off on the $12 billion purchase of five submarines , four conventional and [LOC Latin America  ] 's first nuclear-propelled submarine , to be built in a new shipyard at [LOC Itaguai  ] , as well as 50 military transport helicopters that will be assembled in [LOC Minas Gerais  ] . 
( Comment: The conventional submarines incorporate [MISC U.S.-origin  ] [LOC GE Marine  ] engines . 
) At the same time , [LOC Brazil  ] announced its intention to begin negotiations to purchase the 36 [MISC Rafale  ] fighter jets which could increase the financial transaction to $20 billion if the deal officially goes through . 
The [MISC French  ] have from the start guaranteed to give the [MISC Brazilians Rafale  ] software source codes that represent the very digital heart of the aircraft , a step we understand the others bidders were reluctant at first to take . 
After [PER Lula  ] complained to [PER Sarkozy  ] about the " absurd price " of the [ORG Rafales  ] at $80 million each , MFA sources state that the [MISC French  ] president sent him a personal letter stressing [MISC French  ] willingness to participate in the " unrestricted transfer " of technological intelligence " that the [MISC Brazilian  ] Defense Minister [PER Nelson Jobim  ] had made known was a prerequisite for major arms deals in April . 
Labeled the " [MISC French  ] comparative advantage , " the technology transfer appealed to [LOC Brazil  ] 's desire to not only purchase the [MISC Rafale  ] but to manufacture the aircraft in-country and possibly sell them throughout [LOC Latin America  ] by 2030 , stated the [MISC Brazilian  ] pol-mil attache [PER Marcus Rector Toledo Silva  ] in [LOC Paris  ] to poloff on September 11. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) According to [MISC Brazilian  ] pol-mil attache [PER Silva  ] , the fighter jet saga was spurred by the release of the [MISC Brazilian  ] National Defense Strategy in December 2008 . 
He noted that the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Air Force  ] has 110 jets dating from the 1970s and 1980s that are too old and outdated for a country whose needs include patrolling 5 million square miles of territory , 10.5 million miles of national border , and vast offshore oil platforms . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's most modern aircraft are 12 [MISC French  ] Mirage 2000s , purchased second-hand and approaching their retirement dates . 
By contrast , neighbors [LOC Chile  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] have 29 F-16s and 24 [ORG Sukhoi  ] 30s respectively , both representing the most advanced models available . 
With [PER Hugo Chavez  ] recently buying over $3 billion in aircraft , tanks , and assault weapons from [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] also seeks to enhance its regional military capabilities . 
Thus the deal brokered by [PER Sarkozy  ] was key for [ORG Dassault  ] , bilateral defense ties , and boosting civilian sector trade over the long term . 
In the middle of all the media uproar however , two [MISC Rafale  ] jets fell into the [MISC Mediterranean  ] , provoking much discussion in the [MISC French  ] and [MISC Brazilian  ] press about the fact that the jets had never been sold outside of [LOC France  ] . 
The crash also raised questions about why the [MISC Rafale  ] 's trade deal during the [MISC Moroccan  ] fighter competition in 2008 fell through . 
[MISC FRENCH  ] CONTRIBUTION TO CREATING A MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX --------------------------------------------- ---------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) As [PER Lula  ] has repeatedly stated , [LOC Brazil  ] has ambitions of becoming a world power in the coming decades and believes the key is through the acquisition of certain technological and military autonomy . 
MFA contacts claim that unlike the [LOC U.S.  ] relationship , [LOC France  ] is ready to address [LOC Brazil  ] 's trade and technological development needs . 
Consequently , the recently signed bilateral agreements symbolize more than the purchase of armaments , commented [MISC Brazilian  ] poloff [PER de  ] [PER Lacerdo Carrilho  ] . 
Rather , he stated that they denote the creation of the largest military industrial complex in the southern hemisphere for the emerging industrial superpower , home to the seventh largest oil reserves in the world and the largest area of natural biodiversity in the [LOC Amazon  ] . 
In the last two years , [LOC Brazil  ] has announced the discovery of huge offshore oil reserves called Pre-salt in ultra-deep waters in the [LOC Atlantic  ] that could finance its rise to first world status , according to [PER Lula  ] . 
The country also has vast natural resources in timber , gold , and uranium in the [LOC Amazon  ] , allegedly being exploited illegally by groups said to include the [ORG Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia  ] ( [ORG FARC  ] ) . 
[LOC Brazil  ] seeks to protect its riches and assert itself as a new military power and [LOC France  ] is " ready to fully support [LOC Brazil  ] as an emerging power , " said MFA Assistant Secretary for the [ORG Americas Beton-Delegue  ] to poloffs on October 7. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Under [PER Sarkozy  ] , [LOC France  ] has become a consistent champion of all [MISC Brazilian  ] aspirations , backing efforts for [LOC Brazil  ] 's ascent to a permanent seat on the [ORG UNSC  ] , a long-standing [MISC Brazilian  ] ambition . 
[LOC France  ] also voted for and strongly supported [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] to host the 2016 [MISC Olympics  ] in early September and was one of the first countries to congratulate [LOC Brazil  ] on its victory . 
MFA [LOC Brazil  ] desk officer told poloff that as usual , [PER Sarkozy  ] had the foresight to develop good relations with [LOC Brazil  ] , which is set to showcase two of the world 's greatest sporting events with the 2014 [MISC World Cup  ] final scheduled to be played in [LOC Rio  ] . 
Embassy [LOC Brazil  ] contacts in [LOC Paris  ] believe that the [MISC Franco-Brazilian  ] relationship is only getting started and envision an expansion of the civilian cooperation to possibly include industrial contracts for aerospace and transportation in the upcoming months , once the [MISC Rafale  ] deal is concluded . 
Hinting at rumors that [LOC Brazil  ] could buy as many as 100 [MISC French-made  ] fighter jets , [MISC Brazilian  ] poloff [PER de Lacerdo Carrilho  ] suggested that there is much more to come of the bilateral relationship , whether the [MISC F-X2  ] deal goes through or not. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) COMMENT: The deepening partnership with [LOC Brasilia  ] provides [LOC France  ] with greater entre into [LOC Latin America  ] . 
A strategically symbiotic relationship , [MISC French  ] interest in [LOC Brazil  ] seems to benefit both countries . 
[PER Lula  ] 's decision to back the purchase of [MISC French  ] fighter jets indicates the deepening [MISC Franco-Brazilian  ] relationship and demonstrates the increasing political , diplomatic , and specifically commercial success of [PER Sarkozy  ] 's courtship . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] is expected to shift into diplomatic overdrive in 2011 to boost his 2012 re-election campaign and can point to his foreign policy triumph with [LOC Brazil  ] as an indication of his prowess . 
As the [MISC Brazilians  ] continue to hold bidders in suspense over their fleet renovation project due to be finalized by the end of the year , look for [PER Sarkozy  ] to reappear in the southern hemisphere with his familiar calling card of military and civilian contracts . 
Post welcomes Embassy [LOC Brasilia  ] 's perspectives on this [MISC Paris-based  ] assessment of the growing [MISC Franco-Brazilian  ] relationship .
