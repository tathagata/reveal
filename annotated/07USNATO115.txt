END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] -------------- ( C ) The [ORG SYG  ] expressed his condolences over recent [LOC U.S.  ] troop losses . 
Moving to the agenda , he said [ORG NATO  ] needs to take concrete steps to move ahead on its &comprehensive approach , 8 and cited two areas for immediate action . 
The first would be the creation of a reconstruction and development database , with the aim of improving coordination between the many organizations involved . 
The [ORG SYG  ] suggested keeping the database in [LOC Kabul  ] , with the secretariat of the [ORG JCMB  ] as the repository . 
[ORG NATO  ] would not have a direct role in the project , but would contribute the information in its [ORG Afghanistan Country Stability  ] database . 
SCR [PER Daan Everts  ] will take the lead in promoting this idea in [LOC Kabul  ] . 
Second , the [ORG SYG  ] recommended increased cooperation with the [MISC Japanese  ] government on the comprehensive approach in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The [ORG SYG  ] reported the GoJ will contribute 20 million dollars specifically for development projects in provinces where they currently have no bilateral projects , and will increase cooperation with key contacts as a result . 
Again , SCR [PER Everts  ] will work with the [MISC Japanese  ] Embassy in [LOC Kabul  ] to move this forward . 
Finally , the [ORG SYG  ] reminded PermReps that he is traveling to [LOC Afghanistan  ] with [LOC SACEUR  ] , and will report upon his return. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG CMC  ] Gen. [PER Henault  ] noted that manning issues for [ORG ISAF HQ X  ] remain a concern with many important positions unfilled ; total staffing has increased from 66% to 75% . 
In his operational update , [PER Henault  ] reported that 30 to 60 [MISC Taliban  ] had moved from [LOC Helmand  ] into southern [LOC Farah  ] province , occupying a district center . 
The [MISC GoA  ] had since regained control of the district . 
[PER Henault  ] speculated the [MISC Taliban  ] [ORG USNATO  ] 00000115 002 OF 004 operation may have been related to counter narcotics operations in the area . 
He added the [MISC Taliban  ] can be expected to carry out similar operations , occupying lightly-held districts until run off by [ORG ISAF  ] or [MISC Afghan  ] forces . 
This tactic has the advantage to the [MISC Taliban  ] of undermining local governments , and gaining maximum publicity with minimal risk . 
[PER Henault  ] reported on a February 14 operation 10 kilometers east of [LOC Musa Qala  ] , which resulted in the death of a [MISC Taliban  ] commander . 
Operations are also ongoing to clear insurgent strongholds near the [LOC Kajaki  ] dam. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Cautioning that the information be closely held , [MISC Canadian  ] PermRep [LOC Juneau  ] reported his government is in discussions with the UAE to bring 130 soldiers from that country into [LOC Kandahar  ] . 
The [LOC Emirates  ] , he said , would deploy a [ORG SOF  ] platoon and two infantry platoons ( with troop carriers ) , most probably in [LOC Spin Boldak  ] along the border with [ORG Baluchistan  ] . 
They would arrive in April 2007 , achieving [ORG FOC  ] a month later . 
In addition , the [LOC Emirates  ] will provide up to 30 million dollars of development aid for [LOC Kandahar  ] , for mosques , schools and health clinics . 
Noting the sensitive nature of the information , [LOC UK  ] PermRep [PER Eldon  ] said [LOC Jordan  ] will deploy 80 [ORG SOF  ] troops to [LOC Helmand  ] , where they will have a &normal8 ( vice SF ) role . 
The [MISC Belgian  ] PermRep expressed concern that [MISC Afghan  ] refugees may be forcibly evicted from refugee camps in [LOC Pakistan  ] , then called for increased contact between [ORG NATO  ] and the [ORG UNHCR  ] . 
The [MISC German  ] PermRep asked pointedly about the proposed establishment of an [ORG Afghan Development Zone  ] near [LOC Kunduz  ] , saying the recent meeting of the [ORG JCMB  ] had agreed these are appropriate for southern [LOC Afghanistan  ] , but not for the north. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Eldon  ] reported on [PER Karzai  ] , s February 14 ) 15 visit to the [LOC UK  ] , pointing out that , in his public statements , [PER Karzai  ] took pains not to criticize the [MISC Pakistani  ] government , and instead emphasized conciliation between the two countries . 
[PER Eldon  ] suggested this may show a change in [PER Karzai  ] , s tactics , by handling problems with [LOC Pakistan  ] in private rather than airing grievances publicly . 
The [MISC Italian  ] representative added that , during a February 16 ) 17 visit to [LOC Rome  ] , [PER Karzai  ] emphasized the need for increased justice reform in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , as well as more development funding , to include more work on the [LOC Kabul  ] to [LOC Bamian  ] road . 
[PER Karzai  ] also emphasized the need for [LOC Afghanistan  ] 's neighbors to play a role in stability in [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) Intelligence Division Assistant Director Admiral [PER Clayton  ] , in an intelligence briefing , reported that the [MISC Taliban  ] , despite not winning any clear-cut battles , has nevertheless been able to increase its influence , particularly in southern [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[LOC Helmand  ] province continues to be the focus of the [MISC Taliban  ] , where they are consolidating safe areas ; they also hope to cut off or capture [LOC Kandahar  ] city . 
The morale and confidence of fighters remains high . 
Funding to the [MISC Taliban  ] has increased significantly over the last year , including from &Arab countries8 , while revenues from the opium trade are likely to increase in 2007 . 
In response to this discussion of [MISC Taliban  ] funding from sources in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , [ORG DCM  ] noted the [MISC Saudi  ] government had cooperated with the [ORG USG  ] on terrorist financing and suggested the [ORG USG  ] may be able to provide additional information to Allies . 
[ORG Kosovo USNATO  ] 00000115 003 OF 004 ------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [ORG ASYG  ] reminded the [ORG Council  ] today that [ORG U.N. Special  ] Envoy [PER Ahtisaari  ] will host both [LOC Belgrade  ] and [LOC Pristina  ] negotiating teams in [LOC Vienna  ] to begin their consultations on his status proposal . 
The [ORG CMC  ] briefed that the security situation in [LOC Kosovo  ] remains calm , but tense , noting the recent explosion of the three [MISC UNMIK  ] vehicles on February 19th . 
Leaders from [LOC Kosovo  ] , s [ORG Unity Team  ] visited [MISC Camp Nothing Hill  ] where they received a briefing on [ORG KFOR  ] , s readiness to maintain a safe and secure environment . 
The [MISC Slovenian  ] PermRep announced that his country will be increasing its commitment to [LOC Kosovo  ] by deploying a mechanized battalion of 600 troops which will be located in [ORG Multi-National Task Force-West  ] near the town of [LOC Pec  ] . 
The force will be declared ready by March 1 . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] PermRep announced that his Foreign Minister , in his capacity as the [ORG OSCE  ] representative , will visit both [LOC Belgrade  ] and [LOC Pristina  ] next week . 
[ORG Darfur  ] ------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG D/SYG  ] reported on discussions between the [LOC C.A.R.  ] , [LOC Sudan  ] , and [LOC Chad  ] regarding insurgent groups operating within the three territories , and noted [ORG UN  ] planning for a border monitoring mission along these countries , shared borders . 
Regarding [LOC Somalia  ] , he said the increasing security vacuum there has put the [ORG African Union  ] under pressure to plan for [ORG AMISOM  ] , particularly given the impending arrival of [MISC Ugandan  ] troops . 
If the [ORG AU  ] wants support from [ORG NATO  ] for this mission , it will need to provide specific requests beyond the generic note verbale sent in January. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [ORG CMC  ] Gen. [PER Henault  ] reported a battalion of [MISC Rwandan  ] troops serving in [LOC AMIS  ] are being rotated out using [MISC Algerian-provided  ] aircraft , which should be completed as of February 21 . 
The [ORG AU  ] is expecting [ORG NATO  ] to provide the lift to rotate two additional [MISC Rwandan  ] battalions . 
[PER Henault  ] noted a joint [ORG NATO  ] ) [ORG AU  ] team has traveled to [LOC Khartoum  ] to provide &lessons learned8 training at the [ORG Darfur Integrated Task Force HQ  ] . 
The same team will subsequently provide similar training for the [ORG Force Headquarters in El Fashir  ] . 
[LOC Iraq  ] ---- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) There was no substantive discussion on [LOC Iraq  ] this week . 
[ORG NATO Cooperation  ] with [ORG UN  ] and [ORG EU  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
[LOC UK  ] PermRep [PER Eldon  ] urged [ORG NATO  ] to continue coordinating and cooperating with other organizations such as the [ORG UN  ] and the [ORG EU  ] . 
He suggested that [ORG NATO  ] raise consciousness on issues currently affecting the [ORG UN  ] . 
[MISC Dutch  ] PermRep Schaper suggested [ORG NATO  ] pay close attention to what value it could add to resolving issues being discussed in the [ORG UN  ] or [ORG EU  ] . 
[ORG IBAN Annual Activities Report  ] for 2005 -------------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
The [ORG IBAN  ] report to [ORG Council  ] focused on improving financial management at [ORG NATO  ] , highlighting three substantial audit issues ( including [ORG ACO  ] and ACT ) ; noting the progress made in auditing and closing NSIP projects ; sharing the [ORG Board  ] 's expectation that not all agencies will be IPSAS compliant in 2006 ( resulting in more qualified audit opinions ) ; and requesting the public release of the [ORG IBAN Annual Activities USNATO  ] 00000115 004 OF 004 Report in order to improve fiscal transparency .
