End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The Ambassador had requested the dinner in order to discuss the upcoming visit of the [ORG U.S. Attorney General  ] and to gauge [PER Felix  ] 's willingness to meet with the AG , and assist in setting up a meeting with the Presidential Chief of Staff for [MISC Brazilian  ] President [PER Lula  ] , [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] . 
( Note: The meetings did occur , per [PER Felix  ] 's commitment . 
End note . 
) The likelihood of a late 2007 visit of the [ORG DCIA  ] was also discussed , and [PER Felix  ] repeated throughout the meeting that he believed [LOC Brazil  ] 's intelligence relationship with the [ORG USG  ] was extremely important to [LOC Brazil  ] , and that continued communication between the two respective intelligence services was vital because of the ability to communicate frankly and rapidly without the obstacles of protocol and bureaucracy. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Felix  ] stated he was disappointed over the [ORG U.S. Treasury  ] unilateral designations of triborder area [ORG Hizballah  ] targets . 
For continued joint [ORG CT Operations in Brazil  ] his expectation is that the [ORG USG  ] will treat the [MISC Brazilians  ] as equals and not take this type of unilateral action in the future without first coordinating with the [MISC Brazilian  ] government. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Ambassador noted a recent meeting between [MISC Brazilian  ] Foreign Minister [PER Amorim  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] Foreign Minister Bot , in which the [MISC Dutch  ] Minister explained the benefits of cooperative relations with [ORG NATO  ] . 
Ambassador asked [PER Felix  ] -- as [PER Lula  ] 's security advisor and a senior military officer -- for his views on the issue. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Felix  ] appeared circumspect and said that [MISC Brazilians  ] must face the fact that " a price must be paid " to attain a global leadership role . 
[LOC Brazil  ] must be willing to modernize and deploy its forces for international operations and confront the prospect " of body bags returning to [LOC Brazil  ] . 
" [PER Felix  ] said that he , both personally and as a military man , believed the time had come for [LOC Brazil  ] to pay the price and assume a leadership position in world affairs . 
He opined that closer cooperation with [ORG NATO  ] would be received positively as an issue for discussion with [LOC Brazil  ] 's military leaders , many of whom share [PER Felix  ] 's view. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Regarding [LOC Venezuela  ] , [LOC Bogota  ] and [LOC Bolivia  ] , General [PER Felix  ] down played the rhetoric of [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Chavez  ] , saying he had little influence on [MISC Brazilian  ] internal politics , and that as long as neighboring governments were democratically elected , [LOC Brazil  ] would try to be as accommodating as possible to their particular political idiosyncrasies . 
He commented that [PER Chavez  ] is receiving primarily negative press in [LOC Brazil  ] , and that only a small percentage of political fringe groups might actually support [PER Chavez  ] in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[PER Felix  ] also believed that [PER Morales  ] in [LOC Bolivia  ] poses little political threat to [MISC Brazilian  ] interests , but was concerned about [MISC Bolivian  ] narcotrafficking and its impact on crime in [LOC Brazil  ] 's major cities . 
[PER Felix  ] stated that he was unaware of any [ORG FARC  ] related risks to [LOC Brazil  ] , but committed to working with both the [ORG USG  ] and [MISC Colombian  ] to support the democratically elected government of President [PER Uribe  ] . 
This included working together against transnational crime targets , including narcotrafficking , money laundering , and arms trafficking. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Felix  ] also discussed the political versus operational coordination of such collaboration . 
[PER Felix  ] gave his approval for expanding cooperation , but did not make any new commitments during the meeting . 
[PER Felix  ] expressed his intention to keep the [ORG USG  ] engaged with them over intelligence and threat planning for the [ORG Pan American Games  ] currently scheduled for summer 2007 in [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] , stating that preparations were progressing well. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Comment . 
[PER Felix  ] was remarkably candid , causing some visible surprise in his deputy . 
It will be interesting to see whether [PER Felix  ] retains his position , and this frank communication with us can go on .
