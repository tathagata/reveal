( [ORG S  ] ) Summary . 
On the margins of the [ORG Munich Security Conference  ] , February 6 , [ORG UK Foreign Office  ] Director General for [ORG Defense and Intelligence Mariot  ] [PER Leslie  ] told [PER U/S Tauscher  ] that the allies should negotiate with [LOC Russia  ] a new follow-on agreement to the Conventional Forces in [ORG Europe Treaty  ] . 
[PER Leslie  ] also suggested that [LOC Egypt  ] might abandon its controversial [ORG NPT Revcon Middle East  ] resolution language if it were guaranteed a conference on the subject some time after the May 2010 Review Conference . 
To satisfy [LOC Moscow  ] 's desire for greater inclusion , this conference could be held in [LOC Russia  ] . 
[PER Leslie  ] also noted that she was fighting pressure to abandon stalled FMCT discussions in the [MISC Conference on Disarmament  ] and take up negotiations elsewhere . 
End [LOC Summary.  ] ------ [LOC Russia  ] ------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Briefing on her recent visit to [LOC Moscow  ] , [PER Leslie  ] said [MISC Russian  ] officials had cited their desire for missile defense provisions as the main stumbling block in signing the post-START agreement with the [LOC U.S.  ] The open question , she said , was whether progressives in the [MISC Russian  ] government could out-maneuver the military on this sticking point . 
[PER Leslie  ] also underscored her concerns about the proliferation of missile technology in the [LOC Middle East  ] and stressed the need to turn the page on previous disputes with [LOC Russia  ] over this issue . 
According to [PER Leslie  ] , [MISC Russian  ] FM Lavrov had agreed with her. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Leslie  ] underscored her belief that the [MISC Russians  ] had " lost out " during [ORG CFE  ] and A/CFE negotiations and that the allies should be open to a re-negotiation with [LOC Moscow  ] on the issue of conventional forces . 
However , she recognized that there would likely be strong opposition from flank states like [LOC Turkey  ] and [LOC Norway  ] -- particularly given the spill-over effects into the issue of sub-strategic nuclear weapons . 
Separately , [PER Leslie  ] said she had been surprised by the sudden release of the new [MISC Russian  ] [ORG Defense Strategy  ] . 
While in [LOC Moscow  ] , she said [MISC Russian  ] think tankers had discouraged her from placing too much importance on the strategy . 
Instead , [PER Leslie  ] was told to look at [LOC Russia  ] 's upcoming nuclear declaratory posture for better insights into top-level thinking. -------------------- [ORG NPT Revcon  ] and [LOC Egypt  ] -------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Leslie  ] shared [PER U/S Tauscher  ] 's view that presidential-level engagement could help move [LOC Egypt  ] away from it 's controversial [LOC Middle East  ] resolution language and , thereby , avoid derailing the [ORG NPT Review Conference  ] in May . 
However , she doubted whether engagement alone would be enough . 
[PER Leslie  ] stressed that [PER Mubarak  ] would also need a high-visibility deliverable to take back to his public -- though this deliverable would not necessarily require much substance . 
Specifically , she suggested that [LOC Egypt  ] be supported in its long-held goal to have an international conference on the issue of nuclear security in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
Since [LOC Moscow  ] wanted to be seen as a player in this issue , [PER Leslie  ] believed that holding such a conference in [LOC Russia  ] could kill two birds with one stone. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Leslie  ] said she had discussed this idea with [MISC South African  ] counterparts and had agreed with them that it could work . 
[PER U/S Tauscher  ] stressed the need for assurances that [LOC Egypt  ] would stay in line during the [ORG NPT Review Conference  ] . 
In response , [PER Leslie  ] shared [MISC South African  ] views that [LOC Egypt  ] would lose [ORG NAM  ] support should [LOC Cairo  ] be given support for a conference and later still prove intransigent at the [ORG Revcon  ] . 
Moreover , [PER Leslie  ] suggested that [LOC Egypt  ] might further be kept in check by scheduling the conference after the [ORG NPT Revcon  ] . 
However , it would be important for other countries -- not the [LOC U.S.  ] or [LOC UK  ] -- to push this idea forward . 
As additional ways to move [LOC Egypt  ] , [PER Leslie  ] suggested the possibility of a meeting between the [MISC Egyptian  ] FM and foreign ministers from the [ORG NPT depositary  ] states . 
She also raised the possibility of a special reporteur -- though [PER Leslie  ] recognized that the [MISC French  ] [LOC BERLIN  ] 00000194 002 OF 002 were opposed. -------------- [LOC Treaty Updates  ] -------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Leslie  ] said that she was increasingly under pressure by [MISC British  ] parliamentarians to cease stalled FMCT talks at the [MISC Conference on Disarmament  ] ( [ORG CD  ] ) and move negotiations to another venue . 
However , she continued to push back because the [ORG CD  ] offered exposure to a broad range of nations -- including nuclear states -- and because of the simple lack of any alternative mechanism through which to discuss the issue . 
[PER Leslie  ] believed that , in the future , such a move might be necessary but that now was not the time . 
[PER U/S Tauscher  ] underscored complaints from [LOC Islamabad  ] that the [LOC U.S.-India  ] civilian nuclear agreement somehow short-changed [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
For her part , [PER Leslie  ] stressed the need to get [MISC Indians  ] and [MISC Pakistanis  ] talking again -- even through back-channels . 
Moreover , she said that it might be necessary to validate [MISC Pakistani  ] concerns , while still emphasizing to [LOC Islamabad  ] that these concerns are misplaced . 
Nevertheless , we must make clear to [MISC Pakistani  ] officials that they cannot hold FMCT negotiations hostage as a result. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Leslie  ] was thrilled to hear that the proposed [ORG Defense Trade Treaty  ] between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC UK  ] was again moving in [LOC Washington  ] . 
Meanwhile , in [LOC Moscow  ] , [PER Leslie  ] said she had worked to manage [MISC Russian  ] expectations over [LOC U.S.  ] ratification of the [MISC CTBT  ] . 
Specifically , she underscored mid-term elections in the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [ORG Obama Administration  ] 's packed agenda as reasons why [ORG USG  ] ratification was unlikely this year. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) This cable was cleared with [PER U/S Tauscher  ] .
