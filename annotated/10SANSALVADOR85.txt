( C ) Summary: Embassy [LOC San Salvador  ] warmly welcomes the March 8-9 visit of Assistant Secretary of Defense Dr. [PER Paul N. Stockton  ] and Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Dr. [PER Frank Mora  ] . 
Your visit comes while the [LOC GOES  ] is in the midst of combating a public security crisis of the first order . 
It also comes at a time when the [ORG ESAF  ] has emerged as a major player in President [PER Funes  ] 's anti-crime strategy and his efforts to pursue a center-left , generally pro-U.S. agenda . 
Your visit will help reinforce the [LOC U.S.  ] policy of active engagement with the [LOC GOES  ] , which strengthens the moderate , pragmatic elements in the current administration. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Summary , continued: Recent polls show President [PER Mauricio Funes  ] with an 80 percent approval rating and overwhelming public support for a strong bilateral relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Funes  ] has fostered strong ties with the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] , though some in the [MISC FMLN  ] have pushed him to strengthen ties with [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] while de-emphasizing the [LOC U.S.  ] relationship . 
President [PER Funes'  ] non-FMLN campaign support group , the Friends of [PER Mauricio  ] ( now the [ORG Citizen Movement for Change  ] ) , is largely in control of the economic apparatus of the government . 
Similarly , [LOC Defense  ] is in the hands of a formerly-retired , recently-promoted military officer and Friend of [PER Mauricio  ] , [ORG Brigadier General  ] [PER David Munguia Payes  ] . 
[MISC FMLN  ] members control security , education , and intelligence elements of the [LOC GOES  ] . 
Foreign policy is in the hands of a loyal [MISC FMLN  ] member , but has thus far been characterized by pragmatism and outreach to the [LOC U.S.  ] Combating violent crime and rejuvenating the economy are the [LOC GOES  ] 's top priorities , but the [PER Funes  ] administration has made little progress on either issue since taking office last June . 
End Summary. ---------------------------------- Good Relations with [LOC U.S.  ] Essential ---------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) On the day he was inaugurated , President [PER Funes  ] told Secretary of State [PER Clinton  ] that his government needs a good relationship with the [LOC United States  ] . 
Three out of every ten [MISC Salvadorans  ] live in the [LOC U.S.  ] and those who remain at home are avid consumers of all manner of [MISC American  ] products , media , and culture . 
Nearly half of all [MISC Salvadoran  ] exports are to the [LOC U.S.  ] Given transnational crime links to and from the [LOC U.S.  ] via [ORG Central America  ] , there are no serious alternatives to cooperation with [LOC U.S.  ] law enforcement agencies . 
The [MISC Salvadoran  ] military admires and trusts our armed forces , and naturally look to us for training , equipment , and mentoring . 
USAID and [ORG MCC  ] are prominent actors in social and economic development and are held in high esteem by the [LOC GOES  ] and the people of [LOC El Salvador  ] . 
As a result , the [MISC Salvadoran  ] public is among the most pro-American in the hemisphere . 
Even the hard-line [MISC FMLN  ] recognize these points , if at the same time they do not forget our role in preventing them from seizing power with violence during the country 's protracted and bloody civil war. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) There is a growing division between [PER Funes  ] and the party that brought him to power . 
[PER Funes  ] joined the [MISC FMLN  ] at the end of the 2009 presidential campaign . 
Throughout the campaign , he maintained a close group of pragmatic , non-FMLN advisors ( the Friends of [PER Mauricio  ] ) , a fact which rankled some [MISC FMLN  ] hard-liners . 
Since [PER Funes  ] took power , tensions between [PER Funes  ] 's centrist camp and the far-left [MISC FMLN  ] leadership have grown . 
[PER Funes  ] has publicly rebuked his own Vice President , [MISC FMLN  ] hard-liner [PER Salvador Sanchez Ceren  ] , and other members of the [MISC FMLN  ] for advocating policies that sharply depart from [PER Funes  ] 's moderate reform strategy . 
The [MISC FMLN  ] appears content to ride [PER Funes'  ] high approval numbers while applying pressure via street protests , radical rhetoric , high-profile travel to [LOC Havana  ] and [LOC Caracas  ] , and back-room legislative maneuvering . 
So far , the fragile pact between [PER Funes  ] and the [MISC FMLN  ] remains intact , but the relationship is clearly strained. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The political right is in disarray , though there are signs that the worst of the post-election turmoil may be over . 
After losing the presidential elections in March 2009 , ( center-right ) [ORG ARENA  ] has seen 13 of its 32 legislative deputies leave the party , 12 of them forming a new party , the [ORG Grand Alliance for National Unity  ] ( [ORG GANA  ] ) . 
In December 2009 , [ORG ARENA  ] expelled former President [PER Tony Saca  ] ( 2004-2009 ) from the party for alleged involvement in [ORG GANA  ] 's rebellion . 
While collectively the right-of-center parties could control a majority in the [ORG Legislative Assembly  ] , infighting SAN SALVAD 00000085 002 OF 003 and opportunism have prevented them from uniting to mount an effective opposition to the [MISC FMLN  ] 's and President [PER Funes  ] 's proposals . 
However , inter-party bickering on the right has died down in recent months , and recent conversations with [ORG ARENA  ] leaders suggest the party is finally righting the ship after more than a year of internal confusion and passivity . 
If this rebound strategy works , a rejuvenated [ORG ARENA  ] could serve as an important base of support for President [PER Funes  ] in his struggle with the far-left [MISC FMLN  ] leadership. --------------------------- Military and [ORG Defense Update  ] --------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) Responding to public pressure to stem escalating rates of violent crime , in November 2009 , President [PER Funes  ] deployed approximately 2,500 soldiers to occupy and control 28 of the most violent urban areas in the country . 
These forces supplement the 1,700-2,000 troops already operating joint patrols with the [ORG National Civilian Police  ] ( [ORG PNC  ] ) , meaning that about half of the [MISC Salvadoran  ] [ORG Army  ] 's 10,000 soldiers are engaged in domestic law enforcement . 
Aside from natural disaster relief efforts , this is the largest domestic deployment of the [ORG ESAF  ] since the end of the 1980-92 civil war . 
While initially popular , a consensus has emerged that the added military presence has not significantly reduced violent crime. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Highlights of the bilateral military relationship include: -- Cooperation and training programs intended to maintain a rich military-to-military relationship in humanitarian assistance/disaster relief , counter-terrorism , counter-narcotics , and peacekeeping operations . 
-- As a testament to the strength of the mil-mil relationship and the effectiveness of our training programs , [LOC El Salvador  ] deployed troops to [LOC Iraq  ] from August 2003 until early-2009 who were considered professional and competent by [LOC U.S.  ] and coalition members . 
-- In November 2009 , [ORG Southern Command  ] helicopters , based in [LOC Honduras  ] , ensured rapid and effective delivery of emergency ( mostly USAID ) supplies in the wake of tropical storm [PER Ida  ] . 
-- In June 2009 , the [LOC USNS Comfort  ] visit provided medical attention to nearly 20,000 people and two engineering projects to rural communities . 
Beyond-the-Horizons deployments are scheduled for 2010 and 2011 . 
In November 2009 , the Chief of the [MISC Salvadoran  ] [ORG Navy  ] signed a letter of request for four high-speed maritime interceptors under the [ORG Enduring Friendship Program  ] . 
-- In April 2009 , we renewed the agreement to operate a [ORG Cooperative Security Location  ] ( [ORG CSL  ] ) for another five years . 
The [ORG CSL  ] is located at the military end of the international airport , and serves as a regional hub for counter-drug detection-and-monitoring flights. --------------- [ORG U.S. Priorities  ] --------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Our work in [LOC El Salvador  ] is focused on ( 1 ) promoting improved public security ; ( 2 ) supporting stable , democratic governance ; ( 3 ) broadening economic prosperity ; and ( 4 ) investing in people . 
SAN SALVAD 00000085 003 OF 003 <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Although [LOC El Salvador  ] has made remarkable progress since the 1992 Peace Accords , violent crime continues unabated . 
The [ORG Central American Regional Security Initiative  ] ( [ORG CARSI  ] ) , coupled with ongoing efforts to strengthen the police , expand crime prevention programs , and implement judicial reforms , aims to improve public security and the rule of law . 
On February 18 , the [ORG Legislative Assembly  ] passed a landmark wiretap law which will help authorities combat the growing problem of telephone extortions and assist investigations into a wide range of criminal activities . 
The significant [ORG USG  ] commitment to improving regional security , as evidenced by the presence of the [ORG CSL  ] and the [ORG International Law Enforcement Academy  ] ( [ORG ILEA  ] ) , provides us with additional credibility with the [PER Funes  ] administration. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Promoting economic growth , spurring job creation , and encouraging investment are important near-term [ORG USG  ] priorities . 
[PER Funes  ] 's electoral victory had a great deal to do with public dissatisfaction over economic conditions in [LOC El Salvador  ] . 
[PER Funes  ] inherited an economy already in recession and a fiscal deficit which severely limits what he can do to stimulate growth . 
The [ORG GOES  ] expects to raise $190 million in new revenue with a tax reform passed in December 2009 ; however , many economists project far lower revenue growth . 
The private sector has criticized the tax reform as excessively complex and poorly timed given the economic downturn . 
Business leaders also complain the [ORG GOES  ] has yet to detail regulations on how it will implement the new taxes . 
Redirecting loans from multilateral institutions from debt refinancing to budget assistance will provide some immediate fiscal relief . 
[LOC El Salvador  ] 's economic recovery will largely depend on the [LOC U.S.  ] economy , the destination for about half of its exports and major source of remittances ( $3.8 billion , or 18 percent of GNP , in 2008 ) . 
In the short run , the ( $461 million ) [ORG Millennium Challenge Corporation  ] project will provide much-needed fiscal stimulus and new jobs , while [LOC CAFTA  ] and our USAID assistance programs will help strengthen the foundations for future prosperity. ------------- The [ORG Way Ahead  ] ------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S ) Although the [MISC Salvadoran  ] electorate granted President [PER Funes  ] a mandate for change , by all appearances the voters expect him to work with the country 's dynamic private sector , and to maintain good relations with the [LOC United States  ] . 
Despite continuing problems with crime and a weak economy , the public is pleased with [PER Funes  ] 's work thus far - his approval rating is above 80 percent in recent polling . 
Tensions between [PER Funes  ] and the [MISC FMLN  ] could undermine governability and potentially damage the bilateral relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] Meanwhile , transnational organized crime and violent street gang activity pose as serious threat to the stability of the country . 
Your visit will help reaffirm our commitment to assisting the [ORG GOES  ] in combating this non-traditional national security threat while continuing our traditionally-strong military-to-military relationship .
