She has been elected as Congresswoman three times: in 1996 for [MISC Jaen  ] , in 2000 for [MISC Segovia  ] , and in 2004 for [LOC Madrid.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) From 1994-96 de la [PER Vega  ] served as Secretary of State for [ORG Justice  ] with [ORG Justice  ] Minister [PER Alberto Belloch  ] , a position she held until 1996 .

De la [PER Vega  ] promoted the active participation of State prosecutors in criminal investigation , while maintaining the ultimate control of magistrates in the judicial process. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) De la [PER Vega  ] began her political career with the [ORG Catalan Socialist Party  ] , but in 1979 moved her affiliation to a political movement called " [MISC Justicia Democratica  ] " , a group of judges , prosecutors , and lawyers that played an important role in [LOC Spain  ] 's transition to democracy after [PER Franco  ] 's regime . 
When the [ORG Socialist Party  ] ( [ORG PSOE  ] ) won its first national elections in 1982 , de la [PER Vega  ] served as Chief of Cabinet to Socialist Minister of [ORG Justice  ] [PER Fernando Ledesma  ] . 
In 1985 she was appointed Director General of Services in the [ORG Justice Ministry  ] and under her leadership the number of judges doubled . 
From 1988 to 1990 she worked in the [ORG Secretariat of Labor Magistrates  ] and in 1990 she was appointed spokesperson of the General Council of [ORG Judicial MADRID  ] 00000552 002.2 OF 011 Authority. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) She was born in [LOC Valencia  ] in 1949 . 
She studied Law and received her PhD from the [ORG University of Barcelona  ] . 
She taught Labor Law at the [ORG University of Barcelona  ] . 
She is a specialist in [ORG Human Rights and International Juridical Cooperation  ] with additional training from the [ORG University of Strasbourg.  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- [PER Pedro Solbes  ] Second Vice President and Minister of [ORG Economy  ] and Finance --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) As Vice President for Economic Affairs , [PER Solbes  ] is supposed to exercise control over all the economic decisions of the [ORG GOS  ] , except foreign and domestic trade , tourism , and energy , which fall to the [ORG Ministry of Industry  ] , [ORG Tourism  ] , and [ORG Commerce.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Solbes  ] had reportedly seriously considered leaving the government at the end of [PER Zapatero  ] 's previous term . 
He is 65 , and his wife wanted him to retire . 
[PER Zapatero  ] convinced him to stay , and his presence on the ticket was considered to be an important appeal to the business community , some of whose members have portrayed [PER Solbes  ] as the only bulwark preventing Socialist ministers from overspending . 
[PER Zapatero  ] is reported to have promised [PER Solbes  ] increased authority. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In [PER Zapatero  ] 's first term , [PER Solbes  ] often was at odds with the economic office of the presidency , which tended to favor more interventionist policies . 
[PER Sebastian  ] has now been named Minister of Industry , [ORG Tourism  ] , and [ORG Commerce  ] , and individuals linked to [PER Sebastian  ] have been named to other ministries . 
After [PER Sebastian  ] 's appointment was announced , [PER Solbes  ] told the press , " I am the Economic Vice President . 
I am the one who makes decisions on economic policy . 
I am the one who signs the economic draft laws . 
This is a coalition government between me and the rest . 
" [PER Solbes  ] had clashed with [PER Sebastian  ] in 2005-06 over the [MISC German  ] company [ORG E.ON  ] 's bid to acquire [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG Endesa  ] ; [PER Solbes  ] had not objected to the bid , while [PER Sebastian  ] influenced [ORG GOS  ] attempts to block the bid and later helped broker the eventually successful purchase by [LOC Italy  ] 's [ORG Acciona  ] and [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG Acciona  ] . 
After [PER Zapatero  ] was re-elected , [PER Solbes  ] had reportedly asked [PER Zapatero  ] to give him the energy portfolio as well , but the portfolio remained in [PER Sebastian  ] 's ministry. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) [PER Solbes  ] has traditionally emphasized the importance of fiscal responsibility and maintaining [LOC Spain  ] 's budget surplus . 
With the economy expected to grow much more slowly in 2008 , unemployment rising , and inflation relatively high , he will face pressure to spend more , and he has emphasized for months that the budget surpluses of [PER Zapatero  ] 's first four years have given the [ORG GOS  ] more margin to maneuver in the difficult times expected ahead . 
He already has announced 10 billion euros in tax cuts and spending increases for 2008 , with about 8 billion expected for 2009 . 
He also will be expected to address the housing slowdown , which has increased unemployment and caused serious difficulties for construction and real estate firms , along with their creditors. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 .

He earned praise for his sense of duty and his courage for denouncing the institutional rupture that occurred when the Council of Ministers refused to sanction [LOC France  ] and [LOC Germany  ] for exceeding [ORG European Stability & Growth Pact  ] budget deficit limits. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 .

( U ) [PER Mariano Fernandez Bermejo  ] was appointed Minister of [LOC Justice  ] in February 9 , 2007 , and is retained as a member of the new cabinet . 
The strong recommendation of Vice President [PER Fernandez  ] de la [PER Vega  ] ensured [PER Fernandez Bermejo  ] 's appointment and he is expected to strengthen rapport and cooperation between the [ORG Ministry  ] , the Prosecutor 's Office and the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] . 
He is reported to have a good working relationship with Interior Minister [LOC Rubalcaba  ] and Secretary of State for Security [PER Antonio Camacho.  ] <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As a founding member of the [ORG Progressive Union of Public Prosecutors  ] , [PER Fernandez  ] [PER Bermejo  ] is considered to be the guardian of the [ORG PSOE  ] 's judicial policy . 
[PER Fernandez Bermejo  ] will manage and attempt to inject change into a judicial system in which some " conservative " judges have not been supportive of [MISC GOS-sponsored  ] initiatives , including homosexual marriage and autonomous community statutes. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( U ) First-ranked in his professional certification exams , he began his career as a prosecutor in 1974 in [LOC Santa Cruz de Tenerife  ] , then worked in territorial courts in [MISC Caceres  ] and [ORG Segovia  ] .

( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Fernandez Bermejo  ] is known for taking tough stands and speaking out on issues . 
He is the only prosecutor who has taken a Minister to Court . 
In another example , when he led opposition to the [ORG Rapid Justice Law  ] , the [MISC PP-led  ] government retaliated by passing a law limiting prosecutors to five-year terms instead of lifetime appointments ( effectively moving [PER Fernandez Bermejo  ] along in the system ) . 
Expressing his unhappiness with the [MISC PP  ] maneuver at the time , [PER Fernandez Bermejo  ] said , referring to the [MISC Spanish Civil War  ] and [PER Franco  ] 's regime , " we fought against the parents , and now we have to fight against their children . 
" <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) He is considered to be a strong personality , not given to conciliation , and with a tendency to harsh assessments . 
" I am a leftist , and I behave like one , " he admits . 
Perhaps due to these traits , [PER Fernandez Bermejo  ] has not received the support of the [MISC Concejo Fiscal  ] , the advisory body that reviews judicial appointments , in either of his positions at the [LOC High Court  ] or [ORG Supreme Court  ] . 
According to the media , many [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] civil servants , the judicial secretaries , and the judges believe that [PER Fernandez Bermejo  ] , while focused on policy matters , has not fulfilled his promises on wages or work conditions. <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 .

Her cabinet appointment was the surprise in [PER Zapatero  ] 's second administration amidst widely varying speculation regarding who might be awarded the plum job . 
[PER Zapatero  ] made it clear he intended to put in place a broadly representative cabinet and [PER Chacon  ] brings ties to the [MISC Catalan  ] constituency as well her deep-rooted [ORG PSOE  ] political credentials .

( [ORG SBU  ] ) There was some buzz in conservative circles about [PER Zapatero  ] choosing a [ORG MOD  ] who was a " pacifist . 
" Asked about the label in a recent newspaper interview , [PER Chacon  ] said , in essence , that if being a pacifist meant valuing peace , then she was a pacifist . 
She went on to express her admiration for the [MISC Spanish  ] troops she had just visited in [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Chacon  ] 's priorities will reportedly be the [MISC Spanish  ] military missions abroad , modernization , and personnel restructuring . 
The personnel restructuring will be a particular challenge as some senior officials disagree with plans to reduce the number of generals and there is controversy over proposals to adjust [MISC Spanish  ] troop levels in [LOC Ceuta  ] and [LOC Melilla.  ] <a id='par29' href='#par29'>¶</a>29 .
