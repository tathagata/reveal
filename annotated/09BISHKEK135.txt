( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] During a meeting with the Ambassador February 13 , [MISC Chinese  ] Ambassador [PER Zhang Yannian  ] ridiculed the idea , but did not deny categorically , that [LOC China  ] would provide [LOC Kyrgyzstan  ] a $3 billion financial package in return for closing [LOC Manas Air Base  ] . 
[PER Zhang  ] said [LOC Kyrgyzstan  ] was in [LOC Russia  ] 's sphere of influence , and [LOC China  ] had only commercial interests here . 
He also complained bitterly about [MISC Chinese  ] Guantanamo detainees being shipped to [LOC Germany  ] instead of [LOC China  ] . 
[PER Zhang  ] was very interested in whether the [LOC U.S.  ] would negotiate to keep [PER Manas  ] , and he advised just giving the [MISC Kyrgyz  ] $150 million a year for the [PER Base  ] . 
" This is all about money , " he said . 
End Summary . 
LOSING THE ABILITY TO SPEAK [MISC RUSSIAN  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Ambassador met February 13 with [MISC Chinese  ] Ambassador to [LOC Kyrgyzstan  ] [PER Zhang  ] [PER Yannian  ] . 
After opening pleasantries , the Ambassador mentioned that [MISC Kyrgyz  ] officials had told her that [LOC China  ] had offered a $3 billion financial package to close [LOC Manas Air Base  ] and asked for the Ambassador 's reaction to such an allegation . 
Visibly flustered , [PER Zhang  ] temporarily lost the ability to speak [MISC Russian  ] and began spluttering in [MISC Chinese  ] to the silent aide diligently taking notes right behind him . 
Once he had recovered the power of [MISC Russian  ] speech , he inveighed against such a calumny , claiming that such an idea was impossible , [LOC China  ] was a staunch opponent of terrorism , and [LOC China  ] 's attitude toward [LOC Kyrgyzstan  ] 's decision to close [PER Manas  ] was one of " respect and understanding . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Composing himself , [PER Zhang  ] inquired if maybe the [MISC Kyrgyz  ] had meant the trade turnover between the two countries , which he claimed was about $3 billion a year . 
When disabused of that notion , [PER Zhang  ] went on at length to explain that [LOC China  ] could not afford a $3 billion loan and aid package . 
" It would take $3 from every [MISC Chinese  ] person " to pay for it . 
" If our people found out , there 'd be a revolution , " he said . 
" We have 200 million people unemployed " because of the downturn in exports , he said , and millions of disabled and others who need help from the government . 
A SLAP IN THE FACE <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) When the Ambassador asked whether he would categorically deny what the [MISC Kyrgyz  ] officials had told her about a deal with [LOC China  ] , [PER Zhang  ] snapped that " releasing 17 from [LOC Guantanamo  ] is an unfriendly act toward us . 
" He then went on at length about what a " slap in the face " it was to [LOC China  ] that the [LOC Uighur  ] detainees were not going to be returned to their homeland but instead shipped to [LOC Germany  ] , where reportedly they had already been granted refugee status . 
While not stating a tit-for-tat reaction on [PER Manas  ] , he did imply that the [LOC Guantanamo  ] situation had made [LOC China  ] look for ways to hit back at the [LOC U.S.  ] When the Ambassador inquired if maybe the [MISC Chinese  ] were favorably disposed toward closing [PER Manas  ] because of their [ORG SCO  ] membership , [PER Zhang  ] acknowledged that the [ORG SCO  ] had pronounced for closing [PER Manas  ] , but claimed that " that was years ago and nothing has happened since . 
" He denied that the [ORG SCO  ] was pressuring the [MISC Kyrgyz  ] to close [PER Manas  ] . 
RUSSIA: A GIFT FROM GOD FOR THE [MISC KYRGYZ  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The Ambassador then asked what [PER Zhang  ] thought about the $2 billion plus [MISC Russian  ] deal with [LOC Kyrgyzstan  ] . 
After some hemming and hawing , [PER Zhang  ] said it was " probably true " that [ORG BISHKEK  ] 00000135 002.2 OF 002 the [MISC Russian  ] assistance was tied to closing [PER Manas  ] . 
Asked if he had any concerns about the [LOC Kyrgyz Republic  ] falling ever deeper into the [MISC Russian  ] sphere of influence and whether [LOC China  ] had any interest in countering this , he answered that [LOC Kyrgyzstan  ] was already in that sphere , and [LOC China  ] had no interest in balancing that influence . 
" [LOC Kyrgyzstan  ] is [LOC Russia  ] 's neighbor , " he intoned ( somewhat expansively , since [LOC Kyrgyzstan  ] does not share a border with the [LOC Russian Federation  ] -- though it does share a border with [LOC China  ] ) . 
" And when the [MISC Kyrgyz  ] ask me about this , I always tell them that a neighbor is a gift from God . 
" As for [LOC China  ] 's interests in the [LOC Kyrgyz Republic  ] , he stated flatly: " We have only commercial interests here . 
We want to increase investment and trade . 
We have no interest in politics . 
" He claimed that some [MISC Kyrgyz  ] had argued for [LOC China  ] to open a base in [LOC Kyrgyzstan  ] to counterbalance [MISC Russian  ] and [MISC American  ] influence in the country , but [LOC China  ] has no interest in a base . 
" We want no military or political advantage . 
Therefore , we wouldn't pay $3 billion for [PER Manas  ] , " he argued . 
PERSONAL ADVICE: PAY THEM $150 MILLION <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Zhang  ] asked the Ambassador whether the [LOC U.S.  ] would negotiate to keep the [PER Base  ] open . 
The Ambassador answered that the [LOC U.S.  ] side was evaluating its options . 
[PER Zhang  ] then offered his " personal advice , " " This is all about money , " he said . 
He understood from the [MISC Kyrgyz  ] that they needed $150 million . 
The Ambassador explained that the [LOC U.S.  ] does provide $150 million in assistance to [LOC Kyrgyzstan  ] each year , including numerous assistance programs . 
[PER Zhang  ] suggested that the [LOC U.S.  ] should scrap its assistance programs . 
" Just give them $150 million in cash " per year , and " you will have the [PER Base  ] forever . 
" Very uncharacteristically , the silent young aide then jumped in: " Or maybe you should give them $5 billion and buy both us and the [MISC Russians  ] out . 
" The aide then withered under the Ambassador 's horrified stare. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Commenting on the recent diplomatic corps lunch ( Ref B ) , [PER Zhang  ] noted that [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador [PER Vlasov  ] had been in an expansive mood and dominated portions of the meeting . 
" I think that 's when he found out that they 'd reached a deal " with [PER Bakiyev  ] to close the [ORG Base  ] , he opined . 
[PER Zhang  ] , who is doyen of the diplomatic corps , said he would be leaving [ORG Bishkek  ] soon , but did not yet know his next assignment . 
" In our service , " he said , " we don't know our postings until the last minute . 
" Comment ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Zhang  ] was clearly flustered when confronted with the claims of [MISC Kyrgyz  ] officials that they were negotiating a financial deal with [LOC China  ] in return for closing the [ORG Base  ] . 
While he ridiculed the notion of such a deal , he did not deny it outright . 
Perhaps because of his being discomposed , he returned several times to the topic of a possible revolution in [LOC China  ] if the economic picture does not improve and work is not found for the millions of unemployed there . 
In our experience , talk of revolution at home is taboo for [MISC Chinese  ] diplomats . 
While candid at times , the meeting ended on a very cordial note .
