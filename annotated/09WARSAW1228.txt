<code><pre>S E C R E T WARSAW 001228 SIPDIS DEPT FOR EUR/CE ( GLANTZ ) AND EUR/RPM EO 12958 DECL: 12/18/2019 TAGS [ORG NATO  ] , [ORG MCAP  ] , [ORG MARR  ] , [ORG PREL  ] , PL SUBJECT: [LOC POLAND  ] COULD ACCEPT “COMPLEMENTARY” CONTINGENCY PLANNING FOR [LOC POLAND  ] AND [ORG BALTIC STATES  ] REF: STATE 127892 Classified By: [ORG DCM  ] [PER William Heidt  ] for Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) SUMMARY: Deputy [PER DefMin Stanislaw Komorowski  ] and [ORG MFA Security Policy  ] Director [PER Adam Kobieracki  ] reacted similarly when [ORG DCM  ] raised reftel points -- [LOC Poland  ] strongly agrees with the necessity of contingency planning for the [ORG Baltic States  ] but would like to avoid delays in the completion of the [ORG EAGLE GUARDIAN  ] plan for [LOC Poland  ] . 
However , both [PER Komorowski  ] and [PER Kobieracki  ] suggested that [LOC Poland  ] might be able to accept a “creatively packaged” plan that included separate but complementary components ( “chapters” ) for [LOC Poland  ] and the [ORG Baltic States  ] . 
They agreed that discussions should not be made public . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) In a meeting with [ORG DCM  ] on December 17 , [PER Komorowski  ] expressed satisfaction with the level of cooperation with other [ORG NATO  ] contingency planners on [ORG EAGLE GUARDIAN  ] . 
Poles were active participants in the process and looked forward to its completion by the end of February or early March . 
[PER Komorowski  ] was skeptical that a regional approach to contingency planning was the best way ahead . 
[PER Komorowski  ] said [LOC Warsaw  ] would prefer a unique plan for [LOC Poland  ] , although he allowed that [LOC Warsaw  ] could accept the notion of two complementary chapters for [LOC Poland  ] and the [ORG Baltic States  ] within [ORG EAGLE GUARDIAN  ] . 
More important for [LOC Poland  ] was the need to avoid any delay in completing the plan or to rehash already-agreed components , such as the threat assessment . 
He added that he “agreed entirely” that the issue should remain as secret as possible , and that it was in the “common interest” to avoid public discussion of [ORG NATO  ] contingency planning. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) [PER Kobieracki  ] made similar points to [ORG DCM  ] on December 15 , and suggested the [ORG USG  ] engage in detailed consultations with [MISC Polish  ] officials in [LOC Brussels  ] and with the General Staff in [LOC Warsaw  ] . 
He said [LOC Poland  ] had hoped that a revised [ORG EAGLE GUARDIAN  ] plan could be used as a starting point for developing contingency plans for the [ORG Baltic States  ] rather than become intertwined with them . 
He hinted that a creatively packaged regional plan that met [MISC Polish  ] needs in terms of conditionality and automaticity might be acceptable , but cautioned that [LOC Warsaw  ] would need assurances that [MISC NATO’s  ] defense of [LOC Poland  ] was an “issue in its own right” and not dependent on the security or defense of other [ORG NATO  ] members . 
[PER Kobieracki  ] insisted that [LOC Poland  ] would also need assurances that regional planning would not negatively impact on [MISC NATO’s  ] response to prospective crises , particularly with respect to pre-planned deployments . 
He urged that completion of [ORG EAGLE GUARDIAN  ] not be delayed to accommodate incorporation of the [ORG Baltic States  ] into a regional contingency plan . 
[PER Kobieracki  ] agreed that contingency planning discussions should not be made public .
