After recovering from the initial shock of our base closure notification in March 2006 , the [ORG Icelandic Government  ] has solidified its defense links with its neighbors and within [ORG NATO  ] , successfully hosted [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG NATO  ] ship visits as well as a multinational air defense and counterterrorism exercise , strengthened its [ORG Coast Guard  ] in resources and in international ties , and begun canvassing for [ORG NATO  ] air policing support . 
Former base properties now house university students and academic research centers . 
Although several difficult issues remain -- intelligence cooperation and the future of the air defense radar system among them -- they are partially due to domestic political considerations , and will be solved as the new coalition government settles in . 
With climate change , a likely increase in [ORG North Atlantic  ] energy shipments , a new focus on [MISC Arctic  ] resources , and a more visible [MISC Russian  ] presence , the High [MISC North  ] could easily reemerge as an area of high strategic importance in the decades ahead . 
[LOC U.S.  ] interests in the region will be well served by encouraging [LOC Iceland  ] to continue to develop its security and defense capabilities while we keep our defense options--including access to the base--open . 
End Summary . 
From protests to robust joint efforts ------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) When we notified the [ORG Icelandic Government  ] in March 2006 of the decision to close [ORG U.S. Naval Air Station Keflavik  ] ( [ORG NASKEF  ] ) in six months , bitter disappointment and , in some quarters , outrage were evident . 
Commentators predicted the end of the bilateral relationship and opined that the 1951 [ORG U.S-Iceland Defense Agreement  ] was now worthless . 
Former Prime Minister [PER David Oddsson  ] let it be known that had he been in office , he would have immediately abrogated the treaty and ejected the [LOC U.S.  ] military ahead of the September deadline . 
Minister of Justice [PER Bjorn Bjarnason  ] , considered by many the most pro-U.S. and pro-NATO member of the cabinet , acidly questioned [LOC U.S.  ] dependability in defense matters. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) A year after [ORG NASKEF  ] 's closure , the state of the bilateral relationship is quite different from the gloomy predictions . 
This past August , Prime Minister [PER Haarde  ] told former lead negotiator ASD [PER Tom Hall  ] and Commander [ORG U.S. Air Force Europe  ] ( [ORG USAFE  ] ) General [PER Tom Hobbins  ] that " no one could have imagined a year ago how well things would turn out . 
" Negotiations in 2006 resulted in a technical agreement to close the base and a political [MISC Joint Understanding  ] pointing the way forward . 
The continuing defense relationship was then made visible to the public by cooperation on two major ship visits , a search-and-rescue training visit by a [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC P-3  ] aircraft , and a large-scale multinational air defense and counterterrorism exercise . 
Links between the [MISC Icelandic  ] and [ORG U.S. Coast Guards  ] -- both bilaterally and within the newly-formed [ORG North Atlantic Coast Guard  ] Forum -- continue to grow in depth and breadth . 
Exchanges in law enforcement training and operational information have shown results in counter-narcotics and document fraud detection work . 
Politically , we have worked together at [ORG NATO  ] to gain consensus on a peacetime air defense plan for [LOC Iceland  ] ; transferred [LOC Iceland  ] 's air defense radar system and are nearing completion of future support arrangements ; and held the first round of high-level [ORG Security Dialogue  ] consultations as outlined in the [MISC Joint Understanding  ] . 
Looking beyond the bilateral relationship ----------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Outside the bilateral field , PM [PER Haarde  ] has pressed ahead with a strategy of greater engagement with [LOC Iceland  ] 's neighboring [ORG NATO  ] Allies . 
In early 2007 , [LOC Iceland  ] signed agreements with [LOC Norway  ] and [LOC Denmark  ] on increased defense and security cooperation , and began talks with the [LOC UK  ] and [LOC Canada  ] along the same lines . 
Despite a change in government ( and Foreign Minister ) in May , the [ORG GOI  ] has continued to flesh out the earlier agreements . 
These efforts have resulted in increased visits by [MISC Danish  ] Navy and [ORG Coast Guard  ] vessels , as well as the participation of [MISC Norwegian  ] and [MISC Danish  ] forces in the NORTHERN VIKING air defense and counterterrorism exercise in August 2007 . 
[LOC Norway  ] was among the first [ORG NATO  ] Allies to show interest in providing aircraft for air policing in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
[ORG MFA  ] efforts to secure periodic air policing represent a welcome change in [LOC Iceland  ] 's traditional approach to defense: a recognition that [LOC Iceland  ] must assume more responsibility and , to accomplish this , must be more active within the [ORG Alliance  ] in promoting its own affairs . 
The recent [ORG MFA  ] briefing for all resident [ORG NATO  ] ambassadors on air policing was a first: a true lobbying effort directed at capitals . 
The brief was a shrewd sales pitch , including pledges of significant host nation support for the mission , which would be funded out of the first-ever defense budget in the [MISC Icelandic  ] government 's history . 
This budget ( $8.6 million of a total [ORG GOI  ] budget of $6.9 billion ) is a concrete acknowledgment that [LOC Iceland  ] has realized it needs to provide more for its own defense. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Along the same lines , the [ORG GOI  ] has boosted efforts to provide for greater domestic security . 
In the last year , the [ORG Icelandic Coast Guard  ] ( [ORG ICG  ] ) has awarded contracts for a new patrol vessel and fixed-wing aircraft , while also leasing three search and rescue ( [ORG SAR  ] ) helicopters to replace the [LOC USAF  ] helos that previously provided [ORG SAR  ] backup . 
Minister of Justice [PER Bjarnason  ] , who controls the [ORG ICG  ] , has been developing a plan for procurement of permanent helo support and has been discussing joint purchases with the [MISC Norwegian  ] [ORG SAR  ] authorities . 
The [ORG ICG  ] has also continued a practice of robust international deployments of the [ORG ICG Explosive Ordnance Disposal  ] ( [ORG EOD  ] ) team to peacekeeping operations , most recently in [LOC Lebanon  ] in the winter of 2006-2007 . 
Post has encouraged the [ORG MOJ  ] and [ORG ICG  ] to make their procurement and training plans with an eye towards maintaining the capacity to deploy abroad in [ORG NATO  ] or [ORG UN  ] peacekeeping operations. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) Smart governance has also mitigated the local impact of [ORG NASKEF  ] 's closure on the community of [LOC Reykjanesbaer/Keflavik  ] . 
Job losses , initially feared to be in the hundreds , were minimal as all but a handful of 700-plus former [ORG NASKEF  ] employees found new work . 
This was due to quick engagement by the outgoing [ORG NASKEF/Iceland Defense Force  ] command and the town of [LOC Reykjanesbaer  ] in providing job referral and counseling services , helped by the robust [MISC Icelandic  ] economy and a low unemployment rate . 
Similar focused planning and creative thinking are turning the base facilities into a significant plus for the economy and society . 
On the first anniversary of the March 2006 base closure notification , the Government of [LOC Iceland  ] announced plans to create a university-level academic institution on the former [ORG NASKEF  ] site . 
The " [ORG Keilir Atlantic Center for Excellence  ] " has already begun operations . 
Among other initiatives , it hosted productive meetings with [LOC U.S.  ] Assistant Secretary of [ORG Energy for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy  ] [PER Alexander Karsner  ] and the Director of the [ORG U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory  ] during summer 2007 . 
Discussions are underway about a formal relationship on renewable energy research . 
Meanwhile , the [ORG Keflavik Airport Development Corporation  ] ( [ORG KADECO  ] ) , established to handle other commercially viable real estate on the base , opened 1100 apartments for rental by eager university students and brought in nearly $270 million from the sale of other buildings on the base . 
Remaining Issues: Intelligence , Division of Labor --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) Despite progress , some areas of difficulty remain , particularly in the fields of intelligence-sharing and the operation of the [LOC Iceland  ] Air [ORG Defense System  ] ( [ORG IADS  ] ) . 
These issues are rooted in domestic political battles . 
On intelligence matters , [MISC Icelandic  ] law does not authorize any collection other than for law enforcement purposes , and the [ORG MFA  ] and Justice Ministry are consequently engaged in a turf battle over the intelligence portfolio . 
The [ORG MFA  ] has responsibility for coordination with [ORG NATO  ] Allies on defense matters while police , under the authority of the [ORG MOJ  ] , handle international law enforcement cooperation . 
At the same time , the [ORG MOJ-controlled Coast Guard  ] and " [MISC Viking Squad  ] " special police are the units most likely to operate together with [ORG NATO  ] military units during exercises in [LOC Iceland  ] and elsewhere . 
As such , the [ORG MFA  ] and [ORG MOJ  ] have been the main players in a tug-of-war over intelligence authority , a battle which has thus far stalled serious efforts to provide [ORG USG  ] training and institute regular intelligence exchanges ( a stated goal in the [MISC Joint Understanding  ] ) . <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Similarly , the [ORG MOJ  ] has tried to grab authority for operation of the [ORG IADS  ] air defense radars from the [ORG MFA  ] , with Minister [PER Bjarnason  ] arguing that in peacetime the system plays more of a " homeland security " role than a defense role . 
Though this argument has not yet produced any results , it has been a distraction in the [ORG MFA  ] 's task of reorganizing the [ORG Iceland Radar Agency  ] ( the state-owned corporation that operates [ORG IADS  ] ) in order to cut costs . 
The press has been quick to note that recent management decisions have been handled clumsily . 
However , the [ORG MFA  ] plans to introduce legislation this winter to formally bring the [MISC Radar Agency  ] under its authority and clarify the agency 's status under [MISC Icelandic  ] law . 
Likely to go unaddressed are ongoing questions regarding combat controllers and rules of engagement for [ORG IADS  ] and any [ORG NATO  ] air defense assets it operates with , meaning that continued bilateral and [ORG NATO  ] engagement on this matter will be necessary. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) A further complication is posed by incoming Foreign Minister [PER Gisladottir  ] , who is struggling to reconcile her instinctive discomfort with the use of force to the defense and security responsibilities in her portfolio . 
The [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) party she leads has never been able to agree on a defense policy , not least because of its fairly large pacifist wing . 
After some early stumbles -- e.g. , announcing the news of [LOC Iceland  ] 's withdrawal from the [ORG NATO Training Mission Iraq  ] on the day of [ORG SACEUR  ] 's visit to [LOC Reykjavik  ] in September -- [PER Gisladottir  ] has proven to be an interested student on defense issues . 
Even her strong reluctance to allow [MISC Icelandic  ] peacekeepers to be armed while abroad may be softening somewhat in response to interlocutors' arguments that unarmed peacekeepers can be as much of a force protection burden as they are an asset to deployed units . 
Both her senior [ORG Political Advisor  ] and the [ORG MFA Defense Department  ] Chief have told the Ambassador in recent weeks of her keen desire for additional information and discussion in security matters . 
Continued engagement and exposure will likely prove the best means to develop the Foreign Minister into a long-term partner . 
The [ORG Road Ahead  ] -------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) This fall , Minister of Justice [PER Bjarnason  ] and others in [LOC Iceland  ] have been nearly overcome with " I told you so " fever in response to increased [MISC Russian  ] air activity and renewed territorial claims in the [ORG Arctic  ] . 
To these observers , the decision to close the base was a strategic mistake: climate change , increased shipping routes and oil exploration in the [ORG North Atlantic and Arctic  ] , and a resurgent [LOC Russia  ] will make the [LOC High North  ] ( and [LOC Iceland  ] ) more strategically significant in the future , not less . 
Post has countered that the current status quo--ongoing support for the 1951 Agreement combined with first class maintenance of base military facilities , periodic exercises , and an agile [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG NATO  ] force structure--keep our options open. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) To that end , our military engagement with [LOC Iceland  ] should continue along current lines . 
Regular exercises and operational unit visits will demonstrate the [LOC U.S.  ] interest in and ability to live up to our bilateral commitment . 
We should show support and provide training opportunities for the [MISC Icelandic  ] units most likely to be called on in a crisis . 
Initial discussions for the NORTHERN VIKING 2008 exercise have focused on a USN role with the possibility of [ORG USCG  ] involvement , which meshes perfectly with this aim . 
While arrangements for a more robust intelligence relationship depend on [MISC Icelandic  ] domestic political decisions , we should continue to offer our assistance and make clear what is available once local obstacles are overcome . 
Similarly , post will continue to explore ways to increase [MISC Icelandic  ] participation in [LOC U.S.  ] training opportunities , of which the [ORG GOI  ] has not thus far taken full advantage . 
A crucial tool in our progress thus far has been [ORG EUCOM  ] 's provision of an activated reserve officer to support Embassy [LOC Reykjavik  ] . 
This position serves as the key link between the [ORG USG  ] and [MISC Icelandic  ] government institutions recalculating their strategic worldview and seeking to improve their security capabilities . 
Embassy [LOC Reykjavik  ] believes funding for this position beyond spring 2008 will be essential in helping [LOC Iceland  ] 's transformation into a more active and capable [ORG NATO  ] ally. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Politically , we should continue to support [LOC Iceland  ] 's efforts to increase its defense ties with other [ORG NATO  ] Allies and neighbors . 
We also want to quietly but strongly support efforts to improve the quality of the national discussion on defense and security affairs , such as the FM 's appointment on 8 November of a working group to study [LOC Iceland  ] 's strategic environment . 
Continued expert- and high-level discussions under the [ORG Security Dialogue  ] rubric are a further means of engagement and should be maintained , particularly as [LOC Iceland  ] faces up to the possibility of winning election to the [ORG UN Security Council  ] for the 2009-2010 term . 
We should accommodate the request for a second series of discussions at the U/S level , in late winter/early spring , if possible in the [LOC U.S.  ] These steps will help ensure that we and the Icelanders will be in sync as the security environment in the [LOC High North  ] evolves.
