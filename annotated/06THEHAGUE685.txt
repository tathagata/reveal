End Summary . 
[MISC Dutch  ] Concerned , [MISC Hopeful About  ] [LOC Iran  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) During a wide-ranging conversation with Congressman [PER Wexler  ] , Foreign Minister [PER Bot  ] stated that the [MISC Dutch  ] wish to see the [ORG UN  ] dialogue with [LOC Iran  ] continue , and said that isolating [LOC Iran  ] would only empower the Mullahs . 
[PER Bot  ] indicated that , if the [ORG UN  ] dialogue fails , the [MISC Dutch  ] would support the imposition of sanctions , but expressed doubts that [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC China  ] would go along with this in the [ORG UN Security Council  ] . 
[PER Bot  ] stated that it might not be necessary to isolate [LOC Iran  ] because [LOC Iran  ] in general wishes to maintain a form of international respectability and nearly half of [LOC Iran  ] 's population is under 21 years of age and has very different aspirations from the current government . 
He suggested that new ways to keep pressure on [LOC Iran  ] may have to be found and the [ORG EU  ] and [LOC US  ] would need to be tough with [LOC Iran  ] if they fail in the [ORG UN Security Council  ] . 
Congressman [PER Wexler  ] largely agreed with [PER Bot  ] , saying that through no fault of either side the [LOC US  ] and [ORG EU  ] were working in complete concert on dealing with [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear ambitions. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In his remarks during a discussion on [LOC US  ] and [ORG EU  ] policies towards [LOC Iran  ] and [ORG Hamas  ] at the [ORG Center for Information and Documentation  ] on [LOC Israel  ] ( [ORG CIDI  ] ) on March 22 , MP [PER H.J. Ormel  ] , foreign policy spokesperson for the governing [ORG Christian Democratic Alliance  ] ( [ORG CDA  ] ) party , echoed [PER Bot  ] 's comments about [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Ormel  ] said that [LOC Iran  ] is a nice country , with educated people , but run by crazy ayatollahs . 
He suggested that the [LOC West  ] should find a way to directly engage the [MISC Iranian  ] people because if it isolated [LOC Iran  ] , its people would rally around those ayatollahs . 
[PER Ormel  ] also stated that a pre-emptive strike would be a bad idea , but that if [LOC Iran  ] does obtain nuclear weapons , the [LOC West  ] must consider taking military action in response . 
[PER Wexler  ] again agreed with his [MISC Dutch  ] counterpart , saying that he also would not rule out military action . 
[ORG Hamas  ] and [LOC Israel  ] ---------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On [ORG Hamas  ] 's victory in the [MISC Palestinian  ] elections , [PER Bot  ] stated that the [MISC Dutch  ] had no direct dealings with [ORG Hamas  ] or their representatives . 
[PER Bot  ] added that [ORG Hamas  ] needed to take certain steps ( recognition of [LOC Israel  ] , renunciation of terrorism , and acceptance of the [MISC Palestinians'  ] existing obligations ) before the [MISC Dutch  ] would even consider dealing with them in the future , and that there was no rush within the [ORG EU  ] to engage with [ORG Hamas  ] . 
That did not mean that [ORG Hamas  ] might not eventually be dealt with , [PER Bot  ] said , adding that the [ORG PLO  ] 20 years ago was worse than [ORG Hamas  ] is right now . 
[PER Bot  ] raised concern over how to deal with [ORG Hamas  ] representatives at international organizations , and advocated for developing a unified approach . 
[PER Bot  ] and [PER Wexler  ] agreed that the most pressing challenge was to figure out how to continue assisting the [MISC Palestinian  ] people without providing any money to [ORG Hamas  ] . 
[PER Bot  ] expressed concern that if aid budgeted to build water and power plants were suddenly cut off , the [MISC Iranian  ] government might step in to offer assistance , further destabilizing the peace process. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Bot  ] also indicated skepticism about [MISC Israeli  ] PM [PER Olmert  ] 's proposed unilateral approach to setting [LOC Israel  ] 's borders . 
[PER Bot  ] felt that it would be difficult to obtain broad support for such an agreement , and that as long as the [MISC Palestinians  ] did not have an interest in complying , it will be hard to implement . 
Statements by [PER Olmert  ] that indicated that a unilateral plan would be a first step in the road map encouraged [PER Bot  ] , but he still felt that [LOC Israel  ] would have a hard time implementing a unilateral agreement with its neighbors in the long run . 
Nonetheless , both [PER Bot  ] and [PER Wexler  ] THE HAGUE 00000685 002.3 OF 003 stated that the entire peace process hinged on [PER Olmert  ] winning the March 28 parliamentary elections . 
[PER Wexler  ] went on to say that , following the election , [PER Olmert  ] most likely would lobby the [ORG USG  ] for support of his unilateral road map and then work with the [LOC US  ] to sell it to other countries. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In his remarks at [ORG CIDI  ] , [PER Ormel  ] , who successfully lobbied the [ORG Dutch Parliament  ] to label [ORG Hamas  ] a terrorist organization , expressed views similar to [PER Bot  ] 's on [ORG Hamas  ] , but raised some different concerns . 
[PER Ormel  ] stated that [MISC Dutch  ] public opinion is not very favorable towards [LOC Israel  ] , and that if there were a humanitarian crisis in [LOC Palestine  ] , [MISC Dutch  ] support for [LOC Israel  ] would drop even lower . 
[PER Ormel  ] further stated that [ORG Hamas  ] campaigned effectively by trying to address issues that worry everyone - schools , hospitals , and jobs , while [PER Fatah  ] was a corrupt party that voters came to distrust . 
[PER Wexler  ] rebutted that no differentiation should be made between honest and corrupt terrorists . 
[PER Ormel  ] went on to say that [ORG Hamas  ] is not a threat to [LOC Israel  ] because it can't make a fist . 
The real threat posed by [ORG Hamas  ] is a broader one: that it is a fundamentalist party . 
[PER Wexler  ] Asks For [MISC Dutch  ] Perspective on [LOC Indonesia  ] --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Given the [MISC Netherlands'  ] long history with [LOC Indonesia  ] , Congressman [PER Wexler  ] asked [PER Bot  ] for his advice on how best to engage [LOC Indonesia  ] . 
[PER Wexler  ] mentioned to [PER Bot  ] that he nominated President [PER Yudhoyono  ] for the [MISC Nobel Peace Prize  ] and jokingly asked [PER Bot  ] to write a letter supporting his nomination . 
[PER Bot  ] , who was born in [LOC Indonesia  ] and visits [LOC Indonesia  ] at least once a year , suggested that it deserved more attention as the largest [MISC Muslim  ] country in the world . 
Characterizing [LOC Indonesia  ] as stable , pro-west , and democratic , [PER Bot  ] said that [LOC Indonesia  ] could become a regional counterweight to [LOC China  ] , [LOC India  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
He said that the country first had some internal housekeeping to take care of and that it was very important for the army to modernize , but suggested that a likeable and trustworthy former general as president should help accomplish both of those challenges . 
[PER Bot  ] Asks [PER Wexler  ] About [LOC Iraq  ] -------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Bot  ] asked [PER Wexler  ] about [ORG Congress  ] 's long-term plans regarding [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[PER Wexler  ] replied that the [ORG HIRC  ] had not held a hearing on [LOC Iraq  ] since May 2004 , but that there was no real [ORG Congressional  ] action for the [LOC US  ] to get out tomorrow . 
[PER Bot  ] reported that he had been called before Parliament the day before about [LOC Iraq  ] and was asked whether civil war had started there . 
[PER Bot  ] said that he replied , not yet , although it depends on what one calls civil war . 
[PER Bot  ] said that people in the north and south of [LOC Iraq  ] were doing much better and would likely have little reason to start a civil war . 
He added that the [MISC Sunnis  ] would undoubtedly lose to the north and south and therefore wouldn't have much reason to start a civil war . 
Mentioning that 1400 [MISC Dutch  ] troops had served for almost two years in [LOC Iraq  ] , [PER Bot  ] concluded that failure in [LOC Iraq  ] would have terrible consequences . 
[MISC Muslim  ] Outreach --------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In [LOC Amsterdam  ] , [PER Wexler  ] met with city council member [PER Ahmed Aboutaleb  ] , the top vote recipient in [LOC Amsterdam  ] 's recent local elections and one of the [ORG Embassy  ] 's best contacts in our [MISC Muslim  ] outreach programs . 
[PER Aboutaleb  ] told [PER Wexler  ] about his work with [LOC Amsterdam  ] 's mayor to promote open dialogue among different religious and ethic communities within [LOC Amsterdam  ] . 
He also discussed a course he developed to integrate the [LOC Middle East  ] peace process into secondary education . 
[PER Aboutaleb  ] said that the course , which includes a class trip to [PER Auschwitz  ] , is now being given at all of [LOC Amsterdam  ] 's schools and was developed to promote dialogue between young adults who had essentially heard only their parents' perspectives on the [LOC Middle East  ] before starting the class . 
[PER Aboutaleb  ] went on to express frustration with Prime Minister [PER Balkenende  ] over his slow response to the murder of filmmaker [PER Theo van Gogh  ] and blamed [PER Balkenende  ] 's government for setting a negative climate regarding integration . 
[PER Aboutaleb  ] said that the national government needs to differentiate between extremist and mainstream [MISC Muslim  ] parties . 
Diversity should lead to chances , not tension . 
THE HAGUE 00000685 003.3 OF 003 [PER Wexler  ] later met with district council member [PER Fatima Elatik  ] , who showed [PER Wexler  ] some of the community centers she has developed in a largely immigrant sector of [LOC Amsterdam  ] to help young and old immigrants integrate into [MISC Dutch  ] society .
