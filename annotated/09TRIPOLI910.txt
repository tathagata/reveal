( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary: [MISC Swiss  ] Charge [PER Stefano Lazarotto  ] is making the rounds at [ORG EU  ] embassies in [LOC Tripoli  ] , in an attempt to garner a quorum of ambassadors to attend the upcoming trial of two [MISC Swiss  ] citizens . 
The [MISC Italian  ] , [MISC British  ] , and [MISC French  ] embassies report that they are waiting on official guidance from their respective capitals before responding to the [MISC Swiss  ] request . 
The [MISC Italian  ] Embassy believes the matter will most likely be referred to [LOC Brussels  ] for a decision . 
The trial date has not yet been set , but the [MISC Libyans  ] have already indicated that the hearing may be further delayed , insisting that the detained [MISC Swiss  ] move out of the [MISC Swiss  ] Embassy to another location in [LOC Tripoli  ] in order to receive the [ORG GOL  ] 's official summons . 
The [MISC Swiss  ] Embassy itself has not yet received required [ORG GOL  ] permission to attend the trial , whenever it occurs . 
Post thanks the [ORG Department for its  ] quick response to our request for guidance ( Refs A , B ) . 
Given [ORG EU  ] hesitancy and [ORG GOL  ] sensitivities , we do not currently plan to send a representative to the initial court hearing . 
End Summary . 
[MISC SWISS  ] CHARGE REQUESTS [ORG EU  ] , [LOC US  ] PRESENCE AT COURT HEARING 2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Swiss  ] Charge d'Affaires , [PER Stefano Lazarotto  ] , told [ORG Pol/Econ Chief  ] November 15 that he was in the process of calling on [ORG EU  ] embassies in [LOC Tripoli  ] to request the presence of [ORG EU  ] ambassadors at the court hearing of detained [MISC Swiss  ] citizens , [PER Max Goeldi  ] and [PER Rachid Hamdani  ] . 
[ [PER Note: Lazarotto  ] requested the Ambassador 's attendance during a meeting November 9 ( [PER Ref  ] A ) . 
] He said that the [MISC Spanish  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] ambassadors had already pledged to attend ( we have not yet been able to confirm this with those two embassies ) . 
Although [PER Lazarotto  ] extended the request to the [MISC Italian  ] , [MISC British  ] , and [MISC French  ] ambassadors on November 13 , he said that none of them had officially responded yet . 
According to [PER Lazarotto  ] , the [MISC British  ] ambassador said that current political " sensitivities " in the [MISC UK-Libyan  ] relationship may prevent a public [LOC UK  ] display of support . 
The [MISC French  ] DCM told [ORG Pol/Econ Chief  ] November 15 that he was awaiting an official response from [LOC Paris  ] , which he did not expect to receive until after the [MISC French  ] weekend . 
" If the hearing takes place before we have a response , then of course , we cannot attend , " he stated . 
[ORG EU  ] AMBASSADORS WILL LIKELY REFER REQUEST TO [LOC BRUSSELS  ] 3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In a separate November 15 meeting with [ORG Pol/Econ Chief  ] , [MISC Italian  ] xxxxxxxxxxxx confirmed that [PER Lazarotto  ] had approached the [MISC Italian  ] ambassador with the request that he attend the court hearing. xxxxxxxxxxxx noted that he was aware that the [MISC Swiss  ] had also approached the [MISC Spanish  ] , [MISC French  ] , and [MISC British  ] ambassadors . 
He said that while he did not expect any of the ambassadors to attend in their national capacities , he believed they would each recommend that their governments refer the matter to [LOC Brussels  ] for a decision . 
He asserted that the [MISC Spanish  ] ambassador could not attend the hearing in [LOC Spain  ] 's capacity as [ORG EU  ] President without an official mandate from [LOC Brussels  ] . 
If the [MISC Spanish  ] ambassador were to attend , xxxxxxxxxxxx noted , then he would be representing [LOC Spain  ] alone. xxxxxxxxxxxx said that a decision from [LOC Brussels  ] would take some time , hinting that he did not anticipate an [ORG EU  ] presence at the hearing . 
4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) xxxxxxxxxxxx explained that the [ORG EU  ] nations were already experiencing blowback from the [MISC Libyans  ] for [LOC Switzerland  ] 's recent , unilateral vetoes on [LOC Schengen  ] visa approvals for high-profile [MISC Libyan  ] travelers , such as Saif al-Islam al-Qadhafi ( [PER Ref  ] C ) . 
He said that a number of [ORG EU  ] ambassadors , including the [MISC Italian  ] , had been summoned to the [ORG MFA  ] November 15 for a meeting to discuss the [LOC Schengen  ] visa " situation . 
" xxxxxxxxxxxx lamented that the [ORG GOL  ] continued to " deliberately " misunderstand the [LOC Schengen  ] visa approval process , in spite of numerous clarifications from [ORG EU  ] embassies here . 
The [MISC Europeans  ] were increasingly concerned and angry by the [MISC Swiss  ] use of the veto for political purposes for a system the former claimed was to be based solely on opposition on security grounds. xxxxxxxxxxxx said that he expected the [ORG MFA  ] to attempt to urge the [ORG EU  ] ambassadors to counteract [LOC Schengen  ] visa refusals from the [MISC Swiss  ] in some way . 
[ORG GOL  ] FURTHER COMPLICATES [MISC SWISS  ] ISSUE 5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) To further complicate the situation , the [ORG GOL  ] announced publicly November 12 that the detained [MISC Swiss  ] must move out of the [MISC Swiss  ] Embassy in order to be served a court summons . 
[PER Lazarotto  ] confirmed that the demand had been made privately as well , causing the detained [MISC Swiss  ] deep distress and concern about the consequences of leaving embassy environs . 
" Of course , the decision is theirs , " [PER Lazarotto  ] commented , referring to [PER Goeldi  ] and [PER Hamdani  ] . 
" The [ORG Embassy  ] cannot tell them what to do or advise them not to move out , " [PER Lazarotto  ] stated . 
He suspected that the [MISC Libyans  ] would eventually set a court date , irrespective of [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000910 002.2 OF 002 whether [PER Goeldi  ] and [PER Hamdani  ] moved away from the [ORG Embassy  ] , in order to avoid " losing prestige " or " face " in the international arena . 
According to his analysis , the latest [ORG GOL  ] demand is a pressure tactic designed to intimidate the [MISC Swiss  ] . 
[PER Lazarotto  ] explained that the [MISC Swiss  ] citizens were working with a local lawyer and that the [ORG GOL  ] could simply deliver the summons to him vice the [MISC Swiss  ] [ORG Embassy  ] . 
He said that the [ORG MFA  ] had told him to expect a meeting on November 15 to discuss the situation . 
He believed the [ORG GOL  ] would likely argue that the [MISC Swiss  ] Embassy should step aside and let the businessmen confront the charges as individuals . 
[MISC SWISS  ] WAITING ON PERMISSION TO ATTEND TRIAL 6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In spite of [PER Lazarotto  ] 's efforts to gather a group of ambassadors to attend the court hearing , the [MISC Swiss  ] [ORG Embassy  ] does not yet , itself , have the required permission to be present . 
[PER Lazarotto  ] explained that he had only recently asked the [ORG MFA  ] to grant him access to the courtroom and said that he " hoped " he would be allowed access . 
However , he was not optimistic that third-country ambassadors would be permitted into the courtroom -- or even into the courthouse itself ( location still to be determined ) . 
When asked how he envisioned the scene at the courthouse if the various ambassadors did show up , [PER Lazarotto  ] said that he hoped they could at least stand outside the courthouse , if not inside , in a show of solidarity with the [MISC Swiss  ] . 
7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Lazarotto  ] again thanked the [ORG USG  ] for its support and conveyed that he had advised [LOC Bern  ] to remain discreet regarding the [LOC US  ] role in the [ORG GOL  ] 's release of the [MISC Swiss  ] . 
[ORG Pol/Econ Chief  ] advised him that the Ambassador would not attend the court hearing due to the sensitive nature of our role in the matter . 
[PER Lazarotto  ] empathized and expressed his confidence that the [ORG EU  ] nations would stand in support of the [MISC Swiss  ] cause . 
8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Comment:  ] The [MISC Swiss  ] have alienated the very [MISC European  ] governments they are now trying to recruit for support , through their initial insistence on managing the situation alone , now compounded by their continued application of the [LOC Schengen  ] veto without consultation or communication with [MISC European  ] partners ( an act that is impacting larger [ORG EU  ] interests in [LOC Libya  ] ) . 
The [MISC Italians  ] , [MISC French  ] , and [MISC British  ] are unlikely to send their ambassadors -- or representation at any level -- to the court hearing , and an [ORG EU  ] mandate for the [MISC Spanish  ] ambassador to attend as the representative of the [ORG EU  ] Presidency may be long in coming . 
The [MISC Swiss  ] in [LOC Tripoli  ] , however , are under a different impression . 
Given [ORG EU  ] hesitancy on the matter , [ORG Post  ] does not currently plan to send a representative to the court hearing . 
[ORG Post  ] thanks the [ORG Department for its  ] quick response to our request .
