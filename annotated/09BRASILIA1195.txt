[PER Viana  ] explained that [PER Zelaya  ] reached [LOC Tegucigalpa  ] by land and that it was a [ORG Congress  ] member in [LOC Honduras  ] , who supports [PER Zelaya  ] , who first entered into contact with the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] . 
They were informed that the ousted [ORG First Lady  ] wanted to meet with the [MISC Brazilians  ] in the [MISC Embassy  ] , which they communicated back to [LOC Brasilia  ] , and Under Secretary for [MISC Latin America  ] Amb .

The former [ORG First Lady  ] appeared at the [MISC Embassy  ] with [PER Zelaya  ] and it was Secretary-General ( Deputy FM ) Amb .

( C ) [PER Viana  ] was the one who communicated these approvals to the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] and was the first to speak with [PER Zelaya  ] once he entered and said to the President , " our [MISC Embassy  ] is your house , bien venido . 
" According to [PER Viana  ] , [PER Zelaya  ] responded , " Thank you for your government , s continued support since I was kicked out . 
This is my official return to my country and I am ready to announce that I am back . 
" [ORG MRE  ] officials then called [MISC Brazilian  ] President [PER Lula  ] , who was on the plane to [LOC New York  ] to meet with the [ORG UN  ] , who said the situation was to be kept a secret until [PER Chavez  ] and [PER Zelaya  ] announced [PER Zelaya  ] , s return publicly , which occurred approximately one hour after [PER Zelaya  ] arrived at the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] . 
[PER Viana  ] said that he offered [PER Zelaya  ] asylum but that [PER Zelaya  ] did not want it. -------------------------------------- TENSIONS EASE , HEAVY RESTRICTIONS REMAIN -------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Viana  ] said that the security situation at the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] had improved ; electricity and water were turned back on , however the phone lines were still down but they somehow had access to the internet and their best means of communication was via cellular phones . 
The greatest worry to the [MISC Brazilians  ] right now , he said , is that while people can leave the [MISC Embassy  ] , they are not allowed to return . 
[PER Viana  ] expressed the [ORG GOB  ] , s appreciation for [LOC US  ] assistance in providing a van to take most of their personnel out of the [MISC Embassy  ] because the [MISC Honduran  ] military is not allowing the operation of any vehicles associated with the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] . 
[PER Viana  ] said that once the military expelled protestors who were in front of the [MISC Embassy  ] , 300 [PER Zelaya  ] supporters jumped the fence and sought refuge in the [MISC Embassy  ] . 
It was the [ORG Red Cross  ] that brought three buses to the [MISC Embassy  ] to ensure most of the protestors safe passage out of the [MISC Embassy  ] .

[PER Viana  ] said that the [MISC Brazilians  ] in [LOC Honduras  ] need to have free access into their [MISC Embassy  ] use of their vehicles . 
The [ORG MRE  ] is also looking to get a higher level [MISC Brazilian  ] official into [LOC Honduras  ] to help mediate the situation . 
However , they fear that the official will be barred from entering the [MISC Embassy  ] . 
[PER Viana  ] also said that they hope an [ORG Organization of American States  ] delegation will arrive in [LOC Honduras  ] this weekend , but fear those individuals will also have difficulty entering the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] . 
International flights should be allowed to enter [LOC Honduras  ] starting this weekend , according to [PER Viana.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Viana  ] explained that [LOC Brazil  ] , s current strategy was to involve the [ORG OAS  ] and the international community in negotiations . 
He said [PER Zelaya  ] and the government in power in [LOC Honduras  ] were not communicating at all . 
[PER Zelaya  ] communicates only with the [MISC Brazilians  ] and press . 
The [MISC Brazilians  ] in [LOC Honduras  ] have only been able to communicate with [MISC Honduran  ] military , and this has only developed recently due to assistance from the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Embassy  ] . 
[PER Viana  ] said that the best news he received so far was that the [ORG UN  ] claimed the poor conditions in [LOC Honduras  ] at this point suggest elections in November cannot be free and fair and have suspended election assistance . 
[PER Viana  ] said that increased pressure from the [LOC United States  ] and the international community toward a solution is necessary. -------------------------------------- [LOC BRAZIL  ] PLAYS DOWN [LOC U.S.  ] HELP , BLAMES CHAVEZ IN TALK WITH [LOC UK  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 .

" [PER Mourao  ] told them that , while they did not specifically ask the [LOC U.S.  ] for any assistance , the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Honduras  ] had been quite helpful . 
( [PER Note: Viana  ] communicated several requests for assistance to [PER PolOff  ] in reftel . 
) [PER Mourao  ] told the [MISC British  ] that the help they would like from the [LOC United States  ] is in blocking remittances to [LOC Honduras  ] as a way of pressuring the government in power , as , according to [PER Mourao  ] , 60 percent of remittances into [LOC Honduras  ] come from the [LOC United States  ] . 
[PER Mourao  ] also said the [ORG GOB  ] believes [PER Chavez  ] was behind [PER Zelaya  ] , s plan to appear at the [MISC Brazilian  ] Embassy , and appeared irritated over this .
