Stephen Beecroft  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) This cable is part 1 of 5 in a series on [PER Jordan  ] 's regional security contributions and military support. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: [PER Jordan  ] has been exceptionally responsive to USG requests for military contributions in support of regional and international security priorities . 
In [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Jordan  ] has responded with significant ground and [ORG Special Operations Forces  ] ( [ORG SOF  ] ) . 
These forces are now engaged in combat and security operations alongside [ORG Operation Enduring Freedom  ] ( [ORG OEF  ] ) units . 
Deployments of this magnitude are a first for [PER Jordan  ] . 
While the financial requirements of sustaining large numbers of forces abroad could hamper [PER Jordan  ] 's ability to maintain its contributions , [PER Jordan  ] is otherwise prepared to continue its deployments and seek new ways to support the planned surge of [LOC U.S.  ] forces . 
END SUMMARY . 
Force Deployments in [LOC Afghanistan  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In July 2009 , [PER Jordan  ] deployed a 720 person infantry battalion to [LOC Logar Province  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , for an expected six month deployment . 
The battalion , named [ORG Task Force  ] 222 ( [ORG TF222  ] ) , conducted security operations with [ORG U.S. Task Force Spartan  ] ( 3rd Brigade , 10th [ORG Mountain Division  ] ) . 
Originally deployed to support elections in the province , the battalion now conducts routine security operations . 
[PER Jordan  ] 's Chief of Defense has approved a second rotation ( [MISC TF222-Bravo  ] ) which is scheduled to deploy on January 9 , 2010 . 
TF 222-Bravo will be partnered with the 173d [MISC Airborne Brigade  ] at [LOC Forward Operating Base  ] [ORG Shank.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Jordan  ] included two rotary-wing aviators from the Prince [PER Hashim Royal Brigade  ] with their [ORG TF222  ] deployment to observe [LOC U.S.  ] rotary-wing aviation missions . 
The goal of this deployment is to build [PER Jordan  ] 's capacity for air support of forces with an emphasis on enhancing interoperability with [LOC U.S.  ] forces . 
In September 2009 , [PER Jordan  ] deployed a second round of rotary-wing aviators , with the intent to establish routine rotations. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG Jordanian Special Operations Forces  ] deployed [ORG Task Force  ] 111 ( TF111 ) , a 111-person unit , in May 2009 to conduct combat operations with the [LOC U.S.  ] 5th [ORG Special Forces Group  ] , near [LOC Qalat  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
TF111 redeployed in late August . 
A second iteration of the [ORG SOF  ] unit , [PER TF111-Bravo  ] , deployed to [LOC Afghanistan  ] on October 1 , 2009 , for an expected deployment of 6 months , establishing consistent [MISC Jordanian  ] [ORG SOF  ] presence in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Coordination is underway for the deployment of its replacement , [PER TF111-Charlie  ] , which will deploy to [LOC Afghanistan  ] on February 11 , 2010 . 
Other Contributions for [LOC Afghanistan  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Other contributions to security goals in [LOC Afghanistan  ] include: -- [ORG Jordanian Armed Forces  ] ( [ORG JAF  ] ) operates a military field hospital in [LOC Qalat  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Since 2003 the hospital has treated over 750,000 patients . 
-- In 2003 , [PER Jordan  ] was one of the first countries to send demining teams to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
-- [PER Jordan  ] trained a 50-man cadre of the [LOC Afghanistan  ] National [ORG Army Counter Terrorism  ] force . 
Pay Entitlements Break the [ORG Bank -------------------------------  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Although [PER Jordan  ] has been an eager partner in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , limited resources are a significant constraint . 
TF111 and [ORG TF222  ] deployments have been made possible only through [LOC U.S.  ] support , such as pre-deployment training , airlift , equipment , and billeting. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) A central issue is the requirement under [MISC Jordanian  ] law that forces deployed abroad are paid a combat premium of approximately 1600 [MISC USD  ] per month . 
( Note: These so-called pay entitlements have been consistently paid during [PER Jordan  ] 's [ORG AMMAN  ] 00000091 002 OF 002 19-year history in [LOC UN  ] Peacekeeping operations ( [ORG PKO  ] ) . 
Pay entitlements for [MISC PKOs  ] were funded through the [LOC UN  ] system . 
However , there is no similar mechanism when [PER Jordan  ] deploys independently or with coalition partners , forcing [PER Jordan  ] to make these payments on its own to its forces deployed in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Pay entitlements are a significant element in the [ORG JAF  ] 's growing budget deficit , now estimated to be approximately 150 million [MISC USD  ] . 
The pay entitlements issue nearly derailed the original deployment of [ORG TF222  ] and could limit the sustainability of future rotations of TF111 and [LOC TF222.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Jordan  ] has repeatedly requested assistance from the [LOC U.S.  ] to fund its pay entitlements , a request the USG cannot fulfill . 
[PER Jordan  ] has also requested assistance from the [LOC United Arab Emirates  ] , but so far funds have not been forthcoming . 
[ORG Jordan Wants  ] to Do More ----------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) In meetings [MISC Jordanian  ] officials have indicated their interest in doing more to support the mission in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and the planned surge of [LOC U.S.  ] forces there . 
In particular , both the Chairman of Defense and King [PER Abdullah II  ] have said that [PER Jordan  ] stands ready to contribute additional forces , especially if the pay entitlements issue can be solved . 
In addition , the King has offered to contribute two Blackhawk helicopters for special operations , an offer which is currently under review by [ORG CENTCOM  ] . 
Comment ------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Jordan  ] 's [LOC Afghanistan  ] deployments are a significant expression of support from a key [MISC Arab  ] ally for the mission in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
In addition , [PER Jordan  ] 's forces are showing results . 
Feedback from the field indicates that the [MISC Jordanian  ] military presence is yielding valuable engagement with key leaders in rural areas in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , giving these leaders a promising alternative to [MISC Taliban  ] affiliation . 
In addition , the deployments are helping [PER Jordan  ] acquire experience and skills in a combat situation -- a critical need for a national military that has not deployed in combat in over a generation -- and improving interoperability with [LOC U.S.  ] forces . 
It is clear that [PER Jordan  ] could do more . 
However , with its pay entitlements problem and military budget shortfall , financing remains a barrier .
