( [ORG U  ] ) Summary .

These [ORG FNCP  ] actions include presentation of a petition to all candidates for political office recommending public policies to combat piracy , a national public/private awareness campaign , and continuing public debates to gather support and momentum . 
The [ORG Council  ] and the [LOC Sao Paulo State Interagency Committee Against Piracy  ] closed the meeting with a detailed review of their 2006 -2007 action plans to combat piracy , defined by a combination of law enforcement , educational , preventive and economic measures . 
End Summary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) July marked the first autonomous meeting of the [ORG FNCP  ] , an organization conceived within the [ORG National Council to Combat Piracy and Intellectual Property Crimes  ] ( itself formed in November 2004 ) , and composed of private , state , and social enterprises joined together to combat piracy in its various forms . 
The role of the [ORG FNCP  ] is threefold: ( 1 ) to formulate a permanent discussion and debate framework on combating piracy , ( 2 ) to be a channel of communication between the state-sponsored federal [ORG Council  ] and society at large , and ( 3 ) to continuously enlist the active participation of all current and future members of [ORG FNCP  ] in the ongoing national struggle to combat piracy. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG FNCP  ] President [PER Paulo Rosa  ] , also the President of the [ORG Brazilian Association  ] for the [ORG Recording Industry  ] , introduced a petition for signature that would be presented to all political candidates , containing suggested public policies to be implemented in the fight against piracy , contraband and copyright violation . 
All members present were urged to sign , and the petition is expected to be delivered to candidates within 15 days . 
[PER Rosa  ] hopes that the petition will stimulate debate during the election campaign , especially if presented in terms of loss of jobs and tax revenue , both of which directly affect all voter communities . 
According to [ORG FNCP  ] sources , piracy accounted indirectly for the loss of 496,000 jobs in 2005 , and resulted in another approximately 154,000 jobs not being generated in the formal economy . 
It caused a loss of [ORG USD  ] 2 billion in tax revenues for the federal government , while the manufacturing sector was denied production and sales worth [ORG USD  ] 5.4 billion. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) At the meeting three federal Congressional Deputies , all up for re-election , each reiterated that piracy is not a problem that is coming across the [MISC Paraguayan  ] border in stuffed shopping bags , but rather a structured , illegal trade activity conducted within [LOC Brazil  ] by well-organized gangs . 
According to [ORG FNCP  ] Executive Secretary [PER Alexandre Cruz  ] , this illegal trade has grown 25% in the past 12 months . 
Not only is the problem endemic among the [MISC Brazilian  ] public , it also encompasses many legitimate businessmen and government officials . 
The President of the [ORG Parliamentary Investigative Committee  ] ( [ORG CPI  ] ) on Piracy , Federal Deputy [PER Luiz Antonio Medeiros  ] , whose testimony led to the incarceration of [MISC Brazilian-Chinese  ] businessman ( and counterfeit smuggler ) Law King [PER Chong  ] in 2004 , stated that both [LOC Sao Paulo  ] and [LOC Brasilia  ] are major centers in [LOC Latin America  ] for pirated , counterfeit and smuggled goods . 
He cited as an example the plaza in front of the [ORG Congress  ] in [LOC Brasilia  ] , known as the " [MISC Paraguayan  ] Marketplace . 
" Although located in direct sight of law enforcement officials , the market manages to sell all types of counterfeit and pirated goods . 
Deputy [PER Julio Semeghini  ] mentioned that it is not surprising to see high-ranking government officials in the crowded market purchasing products side by side with the public. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The meeting closed with the [ORG National Council to Combat Piracy and Intellectual Property Crimes  ] and the [LOC Sao Paulo State Interagency Committee  ] to Combat Piracy presenting their current and future plans to combat piracy . 
Both organizations pursue a combination of preventive , educational , economic , and law enforcement measures in combating piracy . 
Each works in coordination with local , state and federal law enforcement and has been successful in lobbying the government to obtain increased funding for law enforcement operations to combat piracy. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
Comment . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The formation of the [ORG FNCP  ] is a positive step in [LOC Brazil  ] 's continuing fight against piracy . 
Its members cross the broad spectrum of industries that are affected by these illegal actions , from the recording , motion picture , and software industries to manufacturers and publishing companies . 
Working as an autonomous unit , [ORG FNCP  ] should be able to serve as a channel between public and private forces , stimulating continued debate , awareness and action against this ever increasing problem . 
[LOC Brazil  ] cannot afford to weaken its present position given the high economic cost in lost sales , impact on jobs , and lost tax revenues .
