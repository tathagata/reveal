REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: Oppositionist hopes that [LOC Iran  ] 's clerical class would mobilize to oppose Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] 's post-election policies appear sharply diminished in the wake of the first [ORG Assembly of Experts  ] meeting since the June 12 Presidential election . 
Not only did the [ORG Assembly  ] , which has the power to appoint , supervise and dismiss the [ORG Supreme Leader  ] , give a ringing endorsement of [PER Khamenei  ] 's rule and his handling of the post-election crisis , it did so in the conspicuous absence of its Chair , [PER Ayatollah Rafsanjani  ] . 
Moreover , leaks of the closed-door proceedings to the conservative press indicate that at least two prominent members of this clerical deliberative body excoriated [PER Rafsanjani  ] for his failure to support [PER Khamenei  ] during the unrest . 
Despite his absence at the closure of the [ORG Assembly of Experts  ] meeting , [PER Rafsanjani  ] was compelled to publicly endorse the closing statement while seated at the knee of the [ORG Supreme Leader  ] during a September 24 press conference . 
END SUMMARY . 
[ORG Assembly  ] of [ORG Experts: A 'Deliberative' Body  ] 2 ( C ) The [MISC Majles-e  ] Khobregan , or [ORG Assembly  ] of Experts ( [ORG AOE  ] ) , is a Constitutionally-mandated deliberative body composed of 86 directly-elected senior clerics from across the country . 
By law , the [ORG Assembly  ] must meet for a minimum of two days twice a year . 
Though theoretically vested with the power to appoint , supervise and dismiss the [ORG Supreme Leader  ] , in practical terms the [ORG Assembly  ] 's only real responsibility is to appoint the [ORG Supreme Leader  ] 's successor should he die or become incapacitated . 
As such , the [ORG AOE  ] 's last noteworthy act was appointing current [ORG Supreme Leader Khamenei  ] after [PER Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini  ] 's 1989 death . 
Every subsequent meeting has ended with the issuance of a perfunctory statement lauding the [ORG Assembly  ] 's decision to appoint [PER Khamenei  ] and praising his leadership . 
Nevertheless , according to [ORG Article  ] 111 of the [LOC Constitution  ] , the [ORG Assembly  ] can find [PER Khamenei  ] unfit for office ; accordingly , control of the [ORG AOE  ] remains a ( potential ) check on the [ORG Supreme Leader  ] 's otherwise unbridled power. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [ORG Assembly  ] is currently chaired by [PER Ayatollah  ] Ali [PER Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani  ] , who was re-elected to the two-year term of Speaker in March 2009 . 
At the time of his re-election , he garnered 51 votes , an improvement over the 46 votes he received in 2007 , despite efforts by hardline conservative clerics , led by [PER Ayatollahs Mesbah-Yazdi  ] and [PER Ibrahim Yazdi  ] , to unseat him . 
First Meeting since the Election <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) On September 22-23 the [ORG AOE  ] convened for the first time since [LOC Iran  ] 's disputed June 12 election . 
[PER Rafsanjani  ] opened the sixth official meeting of this [ORG Fourth Assembly of Experts  ] by again cautioning that a " suspicious faction " is trying to create rifts among [LOC Iran  ] 's leaders and by condemning the " atmosphere of insults and dispute " that has prevailed since the June presidential election . 
He also promised that " system insiders of good will " are developing a plan to resolve [LOC Iran  ] 's domestic political problems . 
His opening statement was followed by reports to the body by Judiciary deputy [PER Mohsen Ejei  ] ( Intelligence Minister during the presidential election and its aftermath ) and [ORG Revolutionary Guards  ] Commander [ORG Jaafari  ] . 
According to press reports , at least sixteen [ORG Assembly  ] members spoke. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Though summaries of the closed-door proceedings released by [PER Rafsanjani  ] 's office did not reflect any discord among the members and indeed indicated the body 's support of him , conservative [MISC Iranian  ] press charged [PER Rafsanjani  ] 's office with 'censoring' coverage of the proceeding , reporting that at least two prominent members sharply criticized [PER Rafsanjani  ] for failing to support the [ORG Supreme Leader  ] after the disputed election . 
One quotation prominently featured in conservative news outlets was [ORG Mashhad Friday Prayer Leader  ] [PER Ayatollah  ] al-Hoda rhetorically asking [PER Rafsanjani  ] , " why after twenty years , have you remained silent in the face of these unprecedented insults ( to the [ORG Supreme Leader  ] ) ? 
" DUBAI 00000389 002.2 OF 002 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) More tellingly , [PER Rafsanjani  ] did not attend the second and final day of the meeting , with recently retired former Judiciary Head [PER Ayatollah Shahrudi  ] chairing in his absence . 
Hardline conservative [PER Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami  ] ( the same cleric who replaced [PER Rafsanjani  ] as [MISC Qods Day  ] prayer leader - reftel ) read the [ORG Assembly  ] 's final statement , which was an unqualified if not fawning endorsement of the [ORG Supreme Leader  ] himself and his " wise policies " for quickly extinguishing the post-election " flames of sedition . 
" [PER Khatami  ] noted that [PER Rafsanjani  ] , despite his absence , agreed with " every point " of the final statement , which also credited [PER Khamenei  ] for dismissing the fraud allegations as part of a plot to undermine the [LOC Islamic Republic  ] . 
The final statement was also noteworthy in its perfunctory congratulations to President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] for his election victory , and its more sincere admonishment of [PER Ahmadinejad  ] to scrupulously follow [ORG Supreme Leader Khamenei  ] 's guidance. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) COMMENT: Following the disputed June 12 presidential election , many speculated that the axis of a [PER Rafsanjani  ] counter-attack would focus on rallying clerical support to his cause . 
However , the rumored [ORG AOE  ] " emergency session " never convened , and absent such a meeting it remained unclear how much support [PER Rafsanjani  ] had among this body that reflects the political leanings of [LOC Iran  ] 's traditional senior clergy . 
Now that the [ORG AOE  ] has met , it is clear that the clerical cavalry isn't coming over the horizon anytime soon . 
Furthermore , the [ORG AOE  ] final statement , seen in conjunction with the removal of [PER Rafsanjani  ] as [MISC Qods Day  ] Speaker ( reftel ) , indicates in the clearest terms yet that in the most severe crisis of his career , [PER Rafsanjani  ] is unable to mobilize his once vast and influential patronage network to achieve his political ends . 
And given that [PER Rafsanjani  ] 's presumed power is serving as at least a partial deterrent to further regime moves against [MISC Mousavi  ] , [PER Karrubi  ] and [PER Khatami  ] , the results of this two-day [ORG AOE  ] session bode ill for the leadership of the oppositionist " [ORG Green Path of Hope  ] . 
" END COMMENT .
