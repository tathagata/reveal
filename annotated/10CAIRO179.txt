<code><pre>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 [LOC CAIRO  ] 000179 SIPDIS NOFORN DEPARTMENT FOR NEA/ELA E.O. 12958: [LOC DECL:  ] 2020/02/09 TAGS: <a href='/tag/PTER_0.html'>PTER</a> <a href='/tag/PREL_0.html'>PREL</a> <a href='/tag/PHUM_0.html'>PHUM</a> <a href='/tag/PGOV_0.html'>PGOV</a> <a href='/tag/KJUS_0.html'>KJUS</a> <a href='/tag/EG_0.html'>EG</a> SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR FBI DIRECTOR MUELLER REF: [LOC CAIRO  ] 64 ; [LOC CAIRO  ] 47 ; 09 [LOC CAIRO  ] 2164 CLASSIFIED BY: [PER Margaret Scobey  ] , Ambassador ; REASON: 1.4 ( B ) , ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Director Mueller , I warmly welcome you to [LOC Cairo  ] . 
Your visit provides the opportunity to review and reinforce our strong law enforcement cooperation with the [ORG State Security Investigative Service  ] ( [ORG SSIS  ] ) , which is under the auspices of Minister of [ORG Interior Habib Al Adly  ] ( we have requested separate meetings with [ORG Adly  ] and [ORG SSIS  ] Director [PER Hasan Abdul-Rahman  ] ) and other [MISC Egyptian  ] agencies involved in law enforcement and counter-terrorism issues . 
We have also requested meetings with President [PER Hosni Mubarak  ] , Director of [MISC Egyptian  ] General Intelligence [PER Omar Soliman  ] and Prosecutor General [PER Abdel Magid Mahmoud.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Building upon the optimism generated by a new [LOC U.S.  ] administration and President [PER Obama  ] 's well-received June 4 speech in [LOC Cairo  ] , we resumed in June our [ORG Strategic Dialogue  ] and set in place a new framework for regular bilateral meetings with the [MISC Egyptians  ] to explore areas for cooperation and coordination , including examining our respective assessments of strategic threats such as [LOC Iran  ] . 
The most recent meeting was hosted by Under Secretary of [ORG State Burns  ] in December in [LOC Washington  ] . 
We are exploring other ways to translate this sense of goodwill into concrete action , including a renewed focus in our bilateral assistance programs on human capacity development and strengthening [LOC Egypt  ] 's ability to compete in education , science , and technology . 
We also recommend you seek an opportunity to express concern about the continuation of the Emergency Law. --------------------------------------------- ---------- Regional Security: [LOC Iran  ] , the [ORG Peace Process  ] --------------------------------------------- ---------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) President [PER Mubarak  ] sees [LOC Iran  ] as [LOC Egypt  ] 's -- and the region 's -- primary strategic threat . 
[LOC Egypt  ] 's already dangerous neighborhood , he believes , has only become more so since the fall of [ORG Saddam  ] , who , as nasty as he was , nevertheless stood as a wall against [LOC Iran  ] . 
He now sees [LOC Tehran  ] 's hand moving with ease throughout the region , " from the [LOC Gulf  ] to [LOC Morocco  ] . 
" The immediate threat to [LOC Egypt  ] comes from [MISC Iranian  ] conspiracies with [ORG Hamas  ] ( which he sees as the " brother " of his own most dangerous internal political threat , the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] ) to stir up unrest in [LOC Gaza  ] , but he is also concerned about [MISC Iranian  ] machinations in [LOC Sudan  ] and their efforts to create havoc elsewhere in the region , including in [LOC Yemen  ] , [LOC Lebanon  ] , and even the [MISC Sinai  ] , via [ORG Hezbollah  ] . 
While [LOC Tehran  ] 's nuclear threat is also a cause for concern , [PER Mubarak  ] is more urgently seized with what he sees as the rise of [MISC Iranian  ] surrogates ( [ORG Hamas  ] and [ORG Hezbollah  ] ) and [MISC Iranian  ] attempts to dominate the [LOC Middle East.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [LOC Egypt  ] continues to support our efforts to resume negotiations between the [MISC Israelis  ] and [MISC Palestinians  ] and maintains a regular dialogue with all sides . 
[MISC Egyptian  ] sponsored negotiations on [MISC Palestinian  ] reconciliation are ongoing . 
[LOC Egypt  ] 's objectives are to avoid another [LOC Gaza  ] crisis while eroding Hamas' power and ultimately returning the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] to [ORG Gaza.  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- Strong Counter-Terrorism Relationship --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [LOC U.S.  ] has both an extradition and a mutual legal assistance treaty with [LOC Egypt  ] . 
We maintain close cooperation on a broad range of counter-terrorism and law enforcement issues. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [LOC Egypt  ] suffered major domestic terror attacks in 2005 ( a [LOC CAIRO  ] 00000179 002 OF 003 simultaneous triple bombing in [LOC Sharm El Sheikh  ] , which killed 88 and wounded 200 ) , and in 2006 ( triple bombing popular in the popular tourist town of [LOC Dahab  ] , which killed 24 people ) . 
In February 2009 , a bomb exploded in the popular [PER Khan El Khalili  ] market place , killing a [MISC French  ] teenager and wounding a number of foreign tourists . 
A number of [MISC Egyptians  ] and foreigners are in custody while security services investigate . 
In late 2008 , the [ORG GOE  ] used the Emergency Law to arrest members of a [ORG Hezbollah  ] cell on suspicion of targeting [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Israeli  ] ships transiting the [LOC Suez Canal  ] . 
The trial in a [ORG State Security Emergency  ] court is ongoing . 
In July 2009 , the [ORG GOE  ] used the Emergency Law to arrest a group of 25 [MISC Egyptians  ] and one [MISC Palestinian  ] on suspicion of weapons smuggling to [LOC Gaza  ] , building drones to assist [ORG Hamas  ] , and according to one of their lawyers , assisting in the February 22 [PER Khan Al-Khalili  ] market bombing , among other crimes . 
They are also accused of killing a [MISC Coptic  ] jeweler and three of his employees in [LOC Cairo  ] 's [LOC Zeitoun  ] neighborhood in May 2008 to finance their activities . 
Members of this cell are in detention awaiting trial. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [MISC Egyptian  ] government 's active opposition to [MISC Islamist  ] terrorism and effective intelligence and security services makes [LOC Egypt  ] an unattractive safe haven for terror groups . 
However , [LOC Egypt  ] 's northern [MISC Sinai  ] region is a base for the smuggling of arms and explosives into [LOC Gaza  ] , and a transit point for [MISC Gazan Palestinians  ] . 
[MISC Palestinian  ] officials from [ORG Hamas  ] have also carried large amounts of cash across the border . 
The smuggling of weapons and other contraband through the [PER Sinai  ] into [LOC Israel  ] and the [LOC Gaza Strip  ] have created criminal networks that may be associated with terror groups in the region . 
Recent violence by some [MISC Sinai  ] Bedouin may be linked in part to these smuggling networks and [MISC Egyptian  ] efforts to dismantle them. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Many of the [MISC Egyptian  ] government 's far-reaching powers in the realm of counter-terrorism come from a broad-reaching Emergency Law , which has been in force almost continuously since 1967 ( ref A ) . 
The government has committed to lifting the [ORG State of Emergency  ] and replacing it with a counterterrorism law . 
Disagreements over the law between the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] and other agencies have focused on the [ORG MOI  ] 's interest in long pre-trial detention , and progress on the law has stalled . 
It will be useful to stress the [ORG USG  ] 's interest in [ORG GOE  ] passage of a counterterrorism law that will protect civil liberties. ---------------------------------------- Internal Politics and Economics ---------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) We continue to promote democratic reform in [LOC Egypt  ] , including the expansion of political freedom and pluralism , and respect for human rights . 
We have urged the [ORG GOE  ] to replace the [ORG State of Emergency  ] , in place almost continuously since 1967 , with counterterrorism legislation that protects civil liberties . 
While often used to target violent [MISC Islamic  ] extremist groups , the [ORG GOE  ] has also used the Emergency Law to target political activity by the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] , writers , activists and others . 
The [ORG Interior Ministry  ] uses [ORG SSIS  ] to monitor and sometimes infiltrate the political opposition and civil society , and to suppress political opposition through arrests , harassment and intimidation. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOE  ] remains skeptical of our role in democracy promotion , complaining that any efforts to open up will result in empowering the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] , which currently holds 86 seats -- as independents -- in [LOC Egypt  ] 's 454-seat parliament . 
Elections for the upper house of the parliament , or the [ORG Shura Council  ] , are to be held in June 2010 and elections for the lower house of parliament or the [ORG People 's Assembly  ] are now scheduled for October <a id='par2010' href='#par2010'>¶</a>2010 . 
Presidential elections will be held in 2011 . 
President [PER Mubarak  ] , in power for over 28 years , has not announced whether he will run again . 
Some believe that he is grooming his son , [PER Gamal Mubarak  ] , to succeed him as President . 
[LOC CAIRO  ] 00000179 003 OF 003 <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) [LOC Egypt  ] has made some progress on economic reform , and the country saw growth rates averaging more than 7% from 2005-2008 . 
However , the impact of the economic expansion has not been felt by all segments of the population , and approximately 40% of [MISC Egyptians  ] live on less than $2 per day . 
High inflation has also negatively impacted the standard of living for many [MISC Egyptians  ] . 
In 2009 , as exports , [LOC Suez Canal  ] revenues , tourism , and remittances all declined in the face of the global economic crisis , GDP growth slowed to 4.5% . 
The growth rate is expected to improve to 5.4% in 2010 . 
[MISC US-Egyptian  ] trade reached roughly $7.5 billion in 2009 , with the [LOC US  ] exporting to [LOC Egypt  ] more than twice what it imports. --------------------------------------------- -------- Police Brutality and [ORG Human Rights Abuses  ] --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [LOC Egypt  ] 's police and domestic security services continue to be the subject of persistent , credible allegations of abuse of detainees . 
Police brutality in [LOC Egypt  ] against common criminals is routine and pervasive , resulting in part from poor training and understaffing . 
Over the past five years , the government has acknowledged that torture takes place , but maintains that it is unusual , and is committed by a small minority of officers . 
Since late 2007 , courts have sentenced approximately 18 police officers to prison terms for torture and killings . 
The [ORG GOE  ] has not yet made a serious effort to transform the police from an instrument of regime power into a public service institution , but there are indications that the government is allowing the courts increased independence to adjudicate some police brutality cases . 
Credible human rights lawyers believe the [ORG GOE  ] is adapting to increased media and blogger scrutiny of torture cases by intimidating victims into dropping cases against the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] ( ref C ) . 
During his January 12-14 visit to [LOC Cairo  ] , Assistant Secretary of [ORG State for Democracy , Labor and Human Rights Posner  ] raised the issue of police brutality with [ORG SSIS  ] Director [PER Rahman  ] ( ref B ) . 
Your meetings would be a useful opportunity to reinforce this message and offer continued [ORG USG  ] assistance in training and education .
