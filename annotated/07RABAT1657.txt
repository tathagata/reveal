Jackson  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: [MISC French  ] President [PER Sarkozy’s  ] October 22-24 visit to [LOC Morocco  ] was viewed as a success by both sides . 
During a star-like visit and speech to the [MISC Moroccan  ] parliament , [PER Sarkozy  ] offered the most explicit [MISC French  ] statement to date in support of [MISC Morocco’s  ] autonomy plan as the basis for a negotiated settlement to the [LOC Sahara  ] dispute . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] also essentially conceded the loss of the sale of [MISC French  ] [ORG Rafale  ] fighters to a “better offer” to [LOC Morocco  ] for [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC F-16s  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] and entourage completed nearly 3 billion [PER Euros  ] worth of commercial deals and military sales during the visit , including a naval frigate . 
The [MISC French  ] Ambassador in [LOC Rabat  ] downplayed the commercial aspects of the trip , instead emphasizing [PER Sarkozy’s  ] “Mediterranean Union” summit proposal and his support for [MISC Moroccan  ] democratic and economic reforms . 
The visit received mainly favorable attention in the local media , featuring images of two heads of state interacting as equal partners and friends . 
End summary. --------------------------------- Leaning Farther Forward on [LOC Sahara  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In an interview with the pro-Palace daily [ORG Le Matin  ] just before his arrival , [PER Sarkozy  ] described [MISC Morocco’s  ] autonomy proposal for the [LOC Sahara  ] as “serious and credible.” Addressing a joint session of parliament in [LOC Rabat  ] on October 23 , [PER Sarkozy  ] appeared to take explicit [MISC French  ] support for [MISC Morocco’s  ] plan a step further , describing it as “a new element , ” in a long deadlocked process , using the [ORG USG  ] formulation that it could “serve as a basis for negotiation in the search for a reasonable settlement to the [LOC Western Sahara  ] issue.” Sarkozy’s remarks on [LOC Sahara  ] appeared to move [LOC France  ] closer toward the [MISC Moroccan  ] position , and were embraced as such by most of the [MISC Moroccan  ] press , which characterized the president’s remarks as a breakthrough for [MISC French  ] policy on the [LOC Sahara  ] question . 
( We understand the [ORG Polisario  ] leadership has protested [PER Sarkozy’s  ] remarks . 
) ------------------------------------ [ORG Mediterranean Union  ] and Other Themes ------------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) During an October 26 briefing , [MISC French  ] Ambassador [PER Jean-Francois Thibault  ] emphasized to the DCM and other members of the diplomatic corps the excellent atmospherics of the [PER Sarkozy  ] visit while downplaying its commercial aspects . 
[PER Thibault  ] stated that [PER Sarkozy  ] came to underscore [MISC French  ] support for [LOC Morocco  ] , s democratic development , reforms not only in the economic realm but also in human rights , and [LOC Morocco  ] , s importance for [MISC Europe.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In that context , [PER Thibault  ] spent several minutes describing the proposed [ORG Mediterranean Union  ] Summit in June 2008 . 
While noting that the union is not intended to replace the [ORG Barcelona Process  ] , he said that the themes would be political , security , energy , educational and agricultural cooperation . 
In response to a question , [PER Thibault  ] opined that the [ORG African Union  ] and [ORG Arab League  ] would be invited to send observers as would some [MISC European  ] nations that do not border the [ORG Mediterranean.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Queried about international issues , [PER Thibault  ] said there had been little discussion beyond the public statements about [LOC Iran  ] and the [LOC Middle East Peace Process  ] . 
Amb . 
[PER Thibault  ] also confirmed that [LOC France  ] and [LOC Morocco  ] also signed agreements on extradition , prisoner transfer , social security , and sanitation. -------------------------------------- Economic Agreements and Military Sales -------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Though downplaying the economic issues that received the greatest coverage in local media , [PER Thibault  ] confirmed that [MISC French  ] companies had completed a “draft” agreement to construct a high-speed rail line ( &train a grande vitesse or TGV8 ) from [LOC Tangier  ] to [LOC Marrakech  ] and from [LOC Casablanca  ] to [LOC Oujda  ] in three phases . 
The first phase would be to provide the engineering , equipment and rolling stock for the [LOC Tangier  ] to [LOC Rabat  ] to [LOC Casablanca  ] portion ; phase two would extend the line to [LOC Marrakech  ] ; finally , the [ORG TGV  ] would link [LOC Casablanca  ] to [LOC Rabat  ] , [LOC Meknes  ] , Fes , and , ultimately , [LOC Oujda  ] . 
The agreement relates to the initial 200-km [MISC Tangier-Kenitra  ] portion of the route , at a cost of 2 billion euros , half of which will go to [LOC RABAT  ] 00001657 002 OF 002 [MISC French  ] companies [ORG Alstom  ] , [ORG SNCF  ] , and [PER Reseau Ferre  ] de [LOC France.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The proposal , which has been under study since 2004 , was apparently seized on as a centerpiece for the visit once it became apparent that [LOC Rabat  ] was determined to proceed with purchase of [MISC American  ] F-16 fighters rather than the [MISC French  ] [ORG Rafale  ] , though the project is not expected to be commissioned until 2013 . 
Perhaps chastened by the [ORG Rafale  ] experience , the [MISC French  ] president told [MISC French  ] attendees at a [MISC Moroccan-French  ] economic forum in [LOC Marrakech  ] on the last day of his visit that they cannot rest on their laurels . 
Instead they must aggressively outbid and outhustle the competition , conceding ( according to the [MISC Moroccan  ] press ) that if the [MISC French  ] lost the [ORG Rafale  ] aircraft deal , “it is because the [MISC Americans  ] made a better offer.” Responding to a press question [PER Sarkozy  ] proudly defended his good relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Other military contracts concluded during the visit included the sale of a [MISC French  ] frigate and the upgrade of 25 [ORG Puma  ] helicopters and 140 armored vehicles . 
In addition , an energy contract was signed to build a 200 million [MISC Euro  ] power plant near [LOC Oujda  ] in [LOC Morocco’s  ] northeast and the [MISC French  ] nuclear group [ORG Areva  ] signed a deal with the [ORG National Phosphate Company  ] ( [ORG OCP  ] ) to extract uranium from [MISC Moroccan  ] phosphoric acid . 
In a press release , the company noted that [MISC Morocco’s  ] reserves of the material total 6 million metric tons , twice the world reserves of actual uranium ore. ------------------------------------------ Press Coverage - Ecstatic , with Exceptions ------------------------------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The visit generated numerous positive images and sound bytes . 
During [MISC Sarkozy’s  ] address to parliament he called for “a real partnership without arrogance” - and promised “France will be at your side” as [LOC Morocco  ] moves forward with its economic and political agenda . 
These and other sound bytes resonated in numerous headlines above glowing articles in the [MISC Moroccan  ] press , as did images of [PER Sarkozy  ] affectionately greeting the King , the royal family , [MISC Moroccan  ] officials , and citizens in carefully managed photo-ops. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Though press coverage of [MISC Sarkozy’s  ] visit was overwhelmingly positive , some commentators voiced resentment - the independent ( [MISC Arabic  ] ) daily [ORG Al Massae  ] groused that [MISC French  ] diplomacy “remains governed by traditional and obtuse concepts” and accused the President of patronizing [LOC Morocco  ] by issuing a “certificate of good conduct” to the regime . 
A leading [MISC Islamist  ] daily deemed insulting [MISC Sarkozy’s  ] assertion during his address to parliament that [MISC Islam  ] stands for goodness , tolerance , and peace , while political [MISC Islam  ] stands for separateness and engenders hostility toward “the other.” The [MISC Arabic  ] daily affiliated with the [MISC Islamist  ] PJD denounced [MISC Sarkozy’s  ] remark as a slap in the face to the [MISC Islamist  ] MPs present in the audience. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) While [PER Sarkozy  ] was generally well received , there was much gossip in [MISC Moroccan  ] salons about a “too relaxed” President slouching comfortably in his chair as he and the King presided over an October 22 signing ceremony at the [LOC Royal Palace  ] in [LOC Marrakech  ] . 
In one image , [PER Sarkozy  ] was seen crossing his legs and pointing the sole of his shoe at the King - a taboo gesture in the [MISC Islamic  ] world . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] was accompanied throughout the visit , including at a banquet with the royal family by his Justice Minister ( of [MISC Moroccan  ] heritage ) [PER Rachida Dati.  ] ***************************************** Visit Embassy [PER Rabat’s Classified Website  ] ; http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/rabat ***************************************** Riley</pre></code>
