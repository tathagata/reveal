( C ) Ambassador , during a January 31 luncheon in honor of [PER Tony Blair  ] at the residence of Prime Minister [PER Shaykh Nasser Al Sabah  ] , pulled aside Foreign Minister [PER Shaykh Dr. Mohammed Al Sabah  ] and raised ref A points concerning [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program , continuing USG concerns , and our efforts to address [LOC Tehran  ] 's intransigence , which now require greater application of international pressure . 
Ambassador also noted [LOC Washington  ] interest in [LOC Kuwait  ] 's recent high-level diplomatic engagement with [LOC Iran  ] ( PM 's visit in November -- ref B ) , [MISC Iranian  ] Parliamentary Speaker [PER Larijani  ] 's visit in January ( Ref C and septel ) , and reports of a possible [PER Amiri  ] visit later this Spring , as well as efforts to expand commercial ties , including oil/gas deals on the continental shelf ( septel ) -- and said that enhanced bilateral cooperation to align our strategies would be welcome . 
The [ORG FM  ] took the points on board , but declined to be drawn out further on [LOC Kuwait  ] 's strategy for dealing with [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Earlier at the same event , Ambassador raised reftel points with the [ORG FM  ] 's Office Director , [PER Shaykh  ] Dr. [PER Ahmad Naser Al Sabah  ] ( Note: also the Prime Minister 's son . 
End Note ) , who asked whether the [MISC Iranian  ] side had committed " in writing " to the [LOC Tehran  ] reactor fuel swap , the [LOC Qom  ] facility inspection and the follow-on meeting of [ORG P5  ] 1 . 
[PER Shaykh Dr. Ahmed  ] suggested that the two critical issues are whether [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program is now so widespread as to be for practical purposes unstoppable -- and whether [LOC Tehran  ] has or is close to having the actual wherewithal to construct a nuclear device . 
Ambassador replied that we are aware of at least three reactors , but said the issue of capability was more difficult to judge -- technical know-how had to be combined with all the various necessary physical components , and there would need to be a political decision to proceed . 
She emphasized that the President 's hand is still outstretched to [LOC Iran  ] , but at some point [LOC Iran  ] will have to face the consequences of its recalcitrance ; moreover , the President was walking a carefully considered fine line in dealing with others who wished to take actions we hoped to avoid. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Dr. [PER Ahmad  ] took Ambassador 's point and noted that a year or two ago , many in [LOC Kuwait  ] hoped a silent , targeted strike would take out the troublesome reactor and leave the region more relaxed . 
He suggested that now , however , [LOC Iran  ] might have multiple reactors and was so intent on achieving its nuclear goal that no matter what the [LOC West  ] did , [LOC Iran  ] would get the bomb , and any attempt to disrupt it militarily or through tough sanctions would go badly for the [LOC West  ] . 
He offered his analysis that " [LOC Iran  ] is very different from [LOC Iraq  ] ; if the " [MISC Murshid  ] " orders his people to do something ( like revenge attacks across the [LOC Gulf  ] , striking [MISC American  ] interests as well as [MISC Arab  ] ) , they will do it , to a person . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Polcounselor separately alluded to USG concerns raised reftel during a January 31 meeting with [ORG MFA Asia Department  ] Counselor [PER Rashid Al-Hajri  ] during a January read-out on [MISC Iranian  ] Speaker [PER Ali Larijani  ] 's visit last week to [LOC Kuwait  ] ( Ref C and septel ) . 
[PER Al-Hajri  ] , in response , delivered the [ORG GoK  ] 's standard ( and not particularly convincing ) talking points on this issue , emphasizing the [ORG GOK  ] 's " clear and unchanging position " that [LOC Iran  ] must abide by [ORG UN  ] and [ORG IAEA  ] safeguards on its nuclear program and opposes any military options in the [LOC Gulf  ] . 
[PER Al-Hajri  ] said [ORG GOK  ] officials invariably stress these points in meetings with [MISC Iranian  ] counterparts ; at the same time , [LOC Kuwait  ] is obliged to conduct bilateral relations on a variety of issues with its larger neighbor. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Comment: [MISC Kuwaitis  ] at all levels are deeply worried about the nuclear ambitions of their much larger neighbor , but are unsure how to respond . 
They worry that an [LOC Iran  ] emboldened by a nuclear arsenal would assert greater regional hegemony at the expense of [MISC Kuwaiti  ] interests , and would be more inclined to meddle in [MISC Kuwaiti  ] internal affairs given the thirty percent of the nation that is Shi'a . 
However , [MISC Kuwaitis  ] are equally concerned about military pre-emption , which they believe would not prove decisive and would lead [LOC Iran  ] to lash out at [LOC US  ] interests in the [LOC Gulf  ] ( including [LOC US  ] military facilities in [LOC Kuwait  ] ) , and against those states in the region seen as allied with the [LOC US  ] . 
[LOC Kuwait  ] 's current limited engagement with [LOC Iran  ] appears to be motivated by a desire to try to lower regional tensions ( particularly between [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] ) , with [LOC Kuwait  ] able to distance itself from the message by emphasizing that it is speaking on behalf of the [ORG GCC  ] in its capacity as [ORG GCC  ] chair for 2010. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) Comment continued: At the same time , [LOC Kuwait  ] more parochially is seeking a way forward to secure [MISC Iranian  ] agreement to tap gas reserves in the disputed continental shelf ( [LOC Kuwait  ] needs the gas , which it has little of domestically , to fuel more and cleaner power plants to meet growing electricity demand ) . 
The careful balancing act [LOC Kuwait  ] is playing was perhaps best exemplified during the visit last week of [MISC Iranian  ] parliamentary Speaker [PER Larijani  ] -- his warning that [ORG GCC  ] states should not allow their territory to be used by the [LOC US  ] to launch attacks against [LOC Iran  ] was carried in most local papers on the front page , above the fold , with prominent coverage given below the fold to comprehensive coverage ( including photos ) of the [MISC US-Kuwait  ] military exercise " Eager Mace . 
" [LOC Kuwait  ] 's nuanced approach requires careful footwork , but PM [PER Nasser Mohammed Al Sabah  ] , former dean of [LOC Tehran  ] 's diplomatic corps and self-described [LOC Iran  ] expert , apparently feels confident he is up to the task -- and doesn't need much help from the [LOC US  ] with the choreography .
