<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L [LOC LONDON  ] 000131 NOFORN SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 01/19/2020 TAGS PINR , PTER , [LOC PINS  ] , [LOC UK  ] , IR SUBJECT: [ SOURCE REMOVED ] TARGETED BY [MISC IRANIAN  ] REGIME Classified By: Political Minister Counselor [PER Greg Berry  ] , reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C/NF ) SUMMARY: [ DETAIL REMOVED ] and prominent [ORG VOA  ] commentator [PER Ali Reza Nourizadeh  ] recently told [ NAME REMOVED ] he had been targeted by [MISC Iranian  ] intelligence , an allegation confirmed by [LOC London  ] [ORG LEGATT  ] . 
[PER Nourizadeh  ] was approached some months ago by [PER Mohammad Reza Sadeqinia  ] , an [MISC Iranian  ] national who introduced himself as a “big fan” of [MISC Nourizadeh’s  ] . 
[PER Nourizadeh  ] met [PER Sadeqinia  ] on several occasions in [LOC London  ] and [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC DC  ] , but became suspicious when [PER Sadeqinia  ] took large numbers of photos , including of [MISC Nourizadeh’s  ] vehicle . 
[PER Sadeqinia  ] was arrested in [LOC California  ] on charges of soliciting murder after he attempted to hire a hitman to kill [MISC Iranian-American  ] broadcaster [PER Jamshid Sharmahd  ] . 
Because his pattern of behavior towards [PER Nourizadeh  ] was similar to his interactions with [PER Sharmahd  ] , [ORG FBI  ] shared the threat information with [LOC UK  ] authorities , who subsequently warned [PER Nourizadeh  ] . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Ali Reza Nourizadeh  ] [ DETAILS REMOVED ] had been visited by [MISC British  ] anti-terrorism police who informed him he had been targeted by the [MISC Iranian  ] regime . 
The [LOC UK  ] authorities ( who , [ NAME REMOVED ] later learned had received the threat information from the [ORG FBI  ] ) told [PER Nourizadeh  ] that [PER Reza Sadeqinia  ] , a man who had visited [PER Nourizadeh  ] several times in [LOC London  ] and [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC DC  ] , was working for the [MISC Iranian  ] intelligence services and gathering information on [MISC Nourizadeh’s  ] habits . 
They advised [PER Nourizadeh  ] that [PER Sadeqinia  ] had been arrested in [LOC California  ] for soliciting the murder of [MISC Iranian-American  ] broadcaster [PER Jamshid Sharmahd.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Nourizadeh  ] , obviously shaken by this news , told [ NAME REMOVED ] [PER Sadeqinia  ] had contacted him several months before , claiming to be a “big fan” of [MISC Nourizadeh’s  ] . 
[PER Nourizadeh  ] became suspicious after [PER Sadeqinia  ] insisted on taking large numbers of photos , including shots of [MISC Nourizadeh’s  ] car and garage . 
His suspicions were confirmed after he received a message from a well-placed friend who told [PER Nourizadeh  ] he had seen dozens of photos of him on the desk of [MISC Iranian  ] Deputy Intelligence Minister [PER Alavi  ] . 
At that point , [PER Nourizadeh  ] stopped taking [MISC Sadeqinia’s  ] calls and heard nothing more about the matter until he was visited by [LOC UK  ] anti-terror police January 14. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) [LOC London  ] [ORG LEGATT  ] confirmed the arrest of [PER Sadeqinia  ] in the [LOC U.S.  ] after he attempted to hire a man to kill [MISC Iranian-American  ] broadcaster [PER Jamshid Sharmahd  ] of [ORG Tondar Radio  ] . 
Prior to the solicitation of the hitman , videos of [PER Sharmahd  ] had begun to appear on [ORG YouTube  ] with commentary that he was acting against [LOC Iran  ] and an enemy of the state . 
[PER Sadeqinia  ] apparently admitted his surveillance of both [PER Sharmahd  ] and [PER Nourizadeh  ] and claimed he was working on behalf of [MISC Iranian  ] intelligence . 
After similar videos of [PER Nourizadeh  ] were discovered , the [ORG FBI  ] authorized [LOC UK  ] authorities to share the threat information with [PER Nourizadeh  ] . 
[LOC UK  ] authorities are working with [PER Nourizadeh  ] to improve his personal security , and [PER Nourizadeh  ] is cooperating by providing information about his interactions with [MISC Sadeqinia.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) COMMENT: [PER Nourizadeh  ] is a well-known figure both inside and outside [LOC Iran  ] , and is an outspoken critic of the [MISC Iranian  ] regime , so it is unsurprising that the regime would want to keep a close eye on him . 
If , however , the regime has targeted [PER Nourizadeh  ] for assassination , as it appears to have done with [PER Sharmahd  ] , it marks a clear escalation in the regime’s attempts to intimidate critics outside its borders , and could have a chilling effect on journalists , academics and others in the [LOC West  ] who until recently felt little physical threat from the regime . 
[PER Nourizadeh  ] , while clearly taking the threat seriously , will not be cowed -- he’s faced this type of threat before ( many years ago when he first left [LOC Iran  ] ) , and he has confidence in the [MISC British  ] authorities’ ability to protect him . 
In fact , he has encouraged other prominent opposition leaders like [PER Shirin Ebadi  ] and [PER Mohsen Makhmalbaf  ] to relocate to [LOC London  ] for their own safety .
