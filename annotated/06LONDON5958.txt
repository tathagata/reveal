( C ) [MISC SUMMARY: Frustrated  ] by the bruising that their community has taken after 24 UK-born [MISC Muslims  ] were arrested in connection with the recently-thwarted air terrorist plot ( reftels ) , prominent [MISC British  ] [ORG Muslims  ] sent an open letter to PM [PER Tony Blair  ] August 12 blaming his policy on [LOC Iraq  ] and the [LOC Middle East  ] for fueling extremism and putting [MISC British  ] citizens at risk . 
HMG reacted angrily to the letter ; in a series of meetings with [MISC Muslim  ] community leaders August 14 , government ministers planned to demand that the [MISC Muslim  ] community itself do more to root out terrorists in its midst . 
At the same time , officials were scheduled to hold talks with leaders of seven [LOC UK  ] localities where they judge unrest among [MISC Muslims  ] may turn into street violence . 
Two [MISC British  ] mosques have been set on fire since the story of the thwarted attacks broke , and [LOC UK  ] police suspect revenge arson . 
Meanwhile , media sources are reporting that [PER Blair  ] has made contingency plans to return to the [LOC UK  ] from holiday in [LOC Barbados  ] if events warrant . 
END SUMMARY . 
( U ) [MISC BRITISH MUSLIMS  ] ANGRY <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) The arrest of 24 UK-born [MISC Muslims  ] ( one has since been released ) in connection with the recently-thwarted air terrorist plot angered and frustrated [MISC Britain’s Muslim  ] community . 
Most feel they are being unjustly blamed and stereotyped. “You cannot assume that [MISC Muslims  ] are collectively responsible for the actions of a few , ” [ORG Muslim Council of Britain  ] ( [ORG MCB  ] ) media spokesman [PER Inayat Bunglawa  ] said August 14 . 
Many [MISC Muslims  ] feel HMG is employing a double standard in dealing with [MISC Muslim  ] suspects , pointing to the [ORG Bank of England’s  ] decision to release the names of 19 of the suspects when their assets were frozen at the time of their arrest . 
( [LOC UK  ] officials defend this unusual practice as necessary to ensure that all assets were properly frozen . 
) “It is important to wait until a thorough investigation has taken place before pointing fingers and drawing conclusions . 
It is important to maintain the legal principles we hold dear , namely the concept of innocent until proven guilty , ” [ORG Federation of Students Islamic Societies  ] ( [ORG FOSIS  ] ) spokesman [PER Wakkas Khan  ] said August 11. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) The [MISC Muslim  ] community’s anger is also fueled by continued resentment of HMG’s handling of the June raid on a home in [LOC Forest Gate  ] in [LOC East London  ] , when 250 officers arrested two [MISC Muslim  ] brothers , shooting one of them in the process , only to release them without charge a few days later . 
Chairman of the [ORG Birmingham Central Mosque  ] [PER Mohammed Nassem  ] said August 12: “With the track record of the police , one doesn’t have much faith in the basis on which people are detained . 
And it poses the question of whether the arrests are part of a political objective , by using [MISC Muslims  ] as a target , using the perception of terrorism to usurp all our civil liberties and get more and more control while moving towards a totalitarian state.” ( Note: The follow-up to the botched raid has irked some other [MISC Britons  ] after the media reported that , since their release , the brothers and their families have been housed at a central [LOC London  ] hotel at taxpayer expense while raid-related damage to the house is repaired , also at government expense . 
End Note ) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) Prominent [MISC British Muslim  ] leaders sent an open letter to PM [PER Tony Blair  ] August 12 stating that his policy on [LOC Iraq  ] and the [LOC Middle East  ] offers “ammunition to extremists” and puts [MISC British  ] lives “at increased risk.” Appearing as a full page advertisement in newspapers August 13 , the letter was signed by three of the four [MISC Muslim  ] MPs , three of the five [MISC Muslim  ] members of the [ORG House of Lords  ] , and 38 [MISC Muslim  ] organizations ( for full text and list of signatories see para 10 ) . 
Although the letter states specifically that “attacking civilians is never justified , ” its signatories have used this sentence as a double-edged sword in defending the letter publicly , in effect equating civilian deaths in [LOC Lebanon  ] with potential civilian deaths from terrorism . 
As [ORG MCB  ] Secretary General Dr. [PER Mohammed Abdul Bari  ] told the press , “As [MISC Muslims  ] , we condemn attacks on civilians wherever they happen . 
Civilians in the [LOC UK  ] , the [LOC Middle East  ] , and the rest of the world should all enjoy protection.” ( U ) HMG ANGRY <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) HMG reacted sharply to the letter . 
A spokesman for PM [PER Blair  ] ( currently on holiday in [LOC Barbados  ] ) , noting that al-Qaida terrorist attacks began well before [LOC Iraq  ] , said , “To imply al-Qaida is driven by an honest disagreement over foreign policy is a mistake.” Home Secretary [PER John Reid  ] told the [ORG BBC  ] , “I’m not going to question the motives of anyone who has signed this letter , but I think it is a dreadful [LOC LONDON  ] 00005958 002 OF 003 misjudgment if we believe the foreign policy of this country should be shaped in part , or in whole , under the threat of terrorist activity if we do not have a foreign policy with which the terrorists happen to agree.” Transport Secretary [PER Douglas Alexander  ] echoed these sentiments , saying “No government worth its salt should allow its foreign policy to be dictated to under the threat of terrorism.” Foreign Secretary [PER Margaret Beckett  ] said it would be “the gravest SIPDIS possible error” to blame foreign policy for the threat of terrorism. “This is part of a distorted view of the world , a distorted view of life , ” she said. “Let’s put the blame where it belongs: with people who wantonly want to take innocent lives.” Other ministers called the letter “facile , ” “dangerous , ” and “foolish.” <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) Communities Secretary [PER Ruth Kelly  ] , along with ministers from her department and the [ORG Home Office  ] , was scheduled to meet with representatives of various [MISC Muslim  ] groups August 14 . 
HMG has made clear that one message officials will deliver in these meetings is that [MISC Muslim  ] leaders must do more to tackle extremism inside their community . 
Although the meetings also represent HMG’s stepped up efforts to engage with [MISC Muslims  ] , [ORG Labour  ] MP [PER Sadiq Khan  ] said the community feels “let down” by HMG efforts to date , particularly the “Preventing Extremism Together” task forces , which the [ORG Home Office  ] created after the 7/7 attacks . 
Very few of the 64 measures recommended by [MISC Muslim  ] leaders on the task force have been implemented , [PER Khan  ] said , creating an “air of despondency” and leading the community to believe that the entire exercise was just a publicity stunt . 
For its part , HMG is keen to show that a substantial action plan is already in place . 
Secretary [PER Kelly  ] has pointed to a new [MISC Commission on Integration  ] and Cohesion to be launched later this month. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) Meanwhile , the media has quoted aides to PM [PER Blair  ] as saying that No. 10 Downing Street has made contingency plans for him to return to the [LOC UK  ] from his vacation in [LOC Barbados  ] if events warrant it . 
These aides have reportedly admitted that the PM would not have left for holiday if he had known that the police were about to arrest the alleged terrorist plotters . 
( U ) ELEMENTS OF UNREST <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Also on August 14 , law enforcement officials were scheduled to meet leaders from seven communities - [LOC Newham  ] , [LOC Hackney  ] , [LOC Barking  ] , [LOC Dagenham  ] , and [LOC Waltham Forest  ] in [LOC London  ] , plus [LOC Birmingham  ] and [LOC High Wycombe  ] - where they judged the possibility for unrest might lead to street violence . 
[PER Lord Ahmed  ] of [LOC Rotherham  ] warned , “The police on the whole have acted professionally and satisfactorily , but they must produce some evidence soon.” Meanwhile , fire fighters took almost two hours to put out a fire at the [LOC Al-Birr  ] mosque in the town of [LOC Basingstoke  ] in southeast [LOC England  ] on August 13 , and [LOC UK  ] officials tell Embassy [LOC London  ] they are seriously considering that the blaze was a revenge arson attack against [MISC Muslims  ] . 
Another mosque in [LOC Blacon  ] in northwest [LOC England  ] was attacked August 10 . 
Leader of white supremacist [ORG British National Party  ] [PER Nick Griffin  ] , at a rally August 12 , called for all [MISC Muslims  ] between 15 and 50 to be banned from flying , and said there was “no such thing as a moderate [LOC Muslim.”  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) COMMENT: Since 7/7 , HMG has invested considerable time and resources in engaging the [MISC British Muslim  ] community . 
The current tensions demonstrate just how little progress has been made . 
At the same time , the [MISC Muslim  ] community’s reaction to the arrests of 24 of its own sons - a knee-jerk reaction blaming HMG - shows that its leaders too have far to go . 
That said , the [MISC Muslim  ] community is not the only element in [LOC Britain  ] blaming HMG’s foreign policy for inciting radical elements ; the left in particular but even the mainstream press has expressed the belief , reportedly wide-spread , that homegrown terrorism is an “inevitable” response to the [MISC UK’s  ] involvement in [LOC Iraq  ] and reluctance to call for an “immediate ceasefire” in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
HMG’s rather heated response to the letter is undoubtedly aimed at swaying broader opinion . 
( U ) FULL TEXT OF LETTER TO PRIME MINISTER [PER BLAIR  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) Begin text of letter: Prime Minister , As [MISC British  ] [MISC Muslims  ] we urge you to do more to fight against all those who target civilians with violence , whenever and wherever that happens . 
It is our view that current [MISC British  ] government policy risks putting civilians at increased risk both in the [LOC UK  ] and abroad . 
To combat terror the government has focused extensively on [LOC LONDON  ] 00005958 003 OF 003 domestic legislation . 
While some of this will have an impact , the government must not ignore the role of its foreign policy . 
The debacle of [LOC Iraq  ] and now the failure to do more to secure an immediate end to the attacks on civilians in the [LOC Middle East  ] not only increases the risk to ordinary people in that region , it is also ammunition to extremists who threaten us all . 
Attacking civilians is never justified . 
This message is a global one . 
We urge the Prime Minister to redouble his efforts to tackle terror and extremism and change our foreign policy to show the world that we value the lives of civilians wherever they live and whatever their religion . 
Such a move would make us all safer . 
( Signed ) [PER Sadiq Khan  ] MP , [PER Shahid Malik  ] MP , [PER Mohammed Sarwar  ] MP , [PER Lord Patel  ] of [ORG Blackburn  ] , [PER Lord Ahmed  ] of [LOC Rotherham  ] , [PER Baronness Uddin  ] , [ORG Association of Muslim Schools  ] , [ORG British Muslim Forum  ] , [ORG Bolton Mosques Council for Community Care , Confederation  ] of [ORG Sunni Mosques  ] , [ORG Midlands Council of Nigerian Muslim Organizations  ] , [PER Council  ] of [ORG Mosques  ] - [LOC London  ] and [ORG Southern Counties  ] , [ORG Council  ] of [ORG Mosques Tower Hamlets  ] , [ORG Da’awtul Islam UK  ] and [PER Eire  ] , [ORG Federation of Muslim Organizations  ] ( [ORG Leicestershire  ] ) , [ORG Federation of Students Islamic Societies  ] ( [ORG FOSIS  ] ) , [ORG Indian Muslim Federation  ] , [ORG Islamic Forum Europe  ] , [ORG Islam Society of Britain  ] , [ORG Jama’at Ahle Sunnat UK  ] , [ORG Jamiat Ahl-e-Hadith UK  ] , [ORG Jamiat-e-Ulema Britain  ] , [ORG Lancashire Council of Mosques  ] , [ORG Muslim Association of Britain  ] , [ORG Muslim Council of Britain  ] , [ORG Muslim Council of Wales  ] , [ORG Muslim Doctors  ] and [ORG Dentists Association  ] , [ORG Muslim Parliament  ] , [ORG Muslim Solidarity Committee  ] , [ORG Muslim Students Society UK  ] and [PER Eire  ] , [ORG Muslim Welfare House  ] ( [LOC London  ] ) , [ORG Muslim Women Society  ] ( [ORG MWS  ] ) , [ORG Muslim Women’s Association  ] , [LOC Northern Ireland  ] [ORG Muslim Family Association  ] ( [ORG NIMFA  ] ) , [ORG Sussex Muslim Society  ] , [ORG The Council of European Jamaats  ] , [ORG UK Action Committee  ] on [ORG Islamic Affairs  ] , [ORG UK Islamic Mission  ] , [ORG UK Turkish Islamic Association  ] , [ORG World Federation of KSIMC  ] , [ORG World Islamic Mission  ] , [ORG Young Muslim Organization UK  ] , [ORG Young Muslim Sisters UK  ] , [ORG Young Muslims UK  ] .
