REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: A key MFA interlocutor discouraged the idea of [LOC U.S.-Libya  ] cooperation on counter-ideological or " soft power " efforts to blunt the appeal of the extremist message in eastern [LOC Libya  ] , arguing such efforts would be counterproductive . 
The [ORG GOL  ] had recently undergone " an awakening " to the fact that there was a real problem with extremism in the east and was now making serious efforts to counter the threat ; the best course for the [LOC U.S.  ] would be to publicly " ignore " extremism in eastern [LOC Libya  ] . 
The [ORG GOL  ] 's strategy appears to combine reliance on traditional efforts by security organizations to monitor and disrupt extremists' activities while engaging in significant development programs to improve socio-economic conditions enough to blunt the appeal of the extremist message . 
Absent agreement by the [ORG GOL  ] to cooperate on counter-ideological or soft power programming , post 's efforts have focused on expanding host government capacity through State , DHS and [ORG Treasury  ] training and assistance programs , which are expected to bolster counter-terrorism efforts . 
End summary . 
2 . 
( C ) In a pair of recent meetings on other issues , P/E Chief engaged with [ORG MFA Americas Desk  ] Director [PER Muhammad Matari  ] in a discussion on the possibility of " soft power " programming in eastern [LOC Libya  ] to help blunt the appeal of extremist messages and reduce the number of young men volunteering from the area to travel to [LOC Iraq  ] to undertake operations against [LOC U.S.  ] and coalition forces . 
Conceding that poor socio-economic conditions in the east , including poor public education and limited social outlets for young people , helped fuel the appeal of more extreme iterations of [MISC Islam  ] used to justify jihad operations , [PER Matari  ] nonetheless threw cold water on the idea of soft power programming under the auspices of the [ORG USG  ] or any other external entity . 
The [ORG GOL  ] had recently undergone " an awakening " to the fact that there was a real problem with extremism in the east , and was now making " serious efforts " to counter that threat . 
3 . 
( C ) Asked whether there was any possibility for [LOC U.S.-Libya  ] cooperation on counter-ideological or soft power efforts , [PER Matari  ] counseled that the best course of action regarding eastern [LOC Libya  ] was to " ignore it " , claiming it would " go away " . 
He strongly advocated against [ORG USG  ] counter-ideological public diplomacy or soft power development efforts , arguing they could further legitimize extremism by: 1 ) showing the extremist message was successful enough that it merited public counter-action ; 2 ) tacitly acknowledging that the [ORG GOL  ] is unable to blunt the threat through " traditional , quiet " channels ( i.e. , through its security apparatus ) , and ; 3 ) suggesting the [ORG GOL  ] facilitated interference by the [LOC U.S.  ] and others in what is widely regarded as an internal [MISC Libyan  ] matter . 
On the latter point , [PER Matari  ] noted [LOC Libya  ] 's difficult experience under [MISC Ottoman  ] and [MISC Italian  ] colonial occupation , stressing that soft power programming could easily be equated with latter-day imperialist manipulation by extremists , and could prompt [MISC Libyans  ] not otherwise inclined towards more extreme iterations of [MISC Islam  ] to embrace extremism as a form of viable resistance to foreign meddling . 
4 . 
( C ) Attributing much of the problem in eastern [LOC Libya  ] to the unhelpful influence of extremists from [LOC Algeria  ] and [LOC Egypt  ] , [PER Matari  ] emphasized that cross-border influence from [LOC Egypt  ] is particularly dangerous . 
Citing previous visits to [LOC Algiers  ] and [LOC Cairo  ] , [PER Matari  ] claimed part of the problem is the dearth of moderate literature compared to more readily available texts advocating more extreme iterations of [MISC Islam  ] . 
An infusion of moderate literature , such as the writings of [PER Jamal  ] al-Banna , a comparatively moderate [MISC Egyptian  ] theologian and younger brother of the founder of the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] , would help . 
( [PER Note: Jamal  ] al-Banna , a consistent advocate of [MISC Islamic  ] reform , has publicly disputed traditional [MISC Islamic  ] teachings on treatment of women and jihad , and created the " [MISC Committee for the Defense of Victims  ] of Terror Fatwas " . 
End note . 
) But this was something for the [ORG GOL  ] to do ; it was " highly unlikely " that the [ORG GOL  ] would sanction any [MISC USG-supported  ] effort in counter-ideological programming . 
Referencing the [MISC Italian  ] colonial occupation , he stressed that anything related to curriculum and political/religious messages is deemed to be " for the government ( of [LOC Libya  ] ) alone to manage " . 
5 . 
( C ) As an alternative to counter-ideological programming , P/E Chief suggested the possibility of micro-enterprise and other targeted development , possibly to be implemented by quasi-governmental [ORG NGO  ] 's such as the [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] . 
[PER Matari  ] underscored the [ORG GOL  ] 's sensitivity concerning anything that appeared to be foreign assistance , suggesting " as a friend " that the [LOC U.S.  ] recall that [LOC Libya  ] 's official position is that it is an oil-rich state that provides assistance to others not blessed with oil , particularly sub-Saharan [MISC African  ] states . 
( [MISC Note:  ] Several international oil companies tried soon after [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000307 002.2 OF 002 re-starting operations in 2004 to engage in targeted development under the auspices of their corporate outreach programs - soccer leagues , tutoring programs , micro-loan and micro-enterprise projects . 
The [ORG GOL  ] categorically declined the oil companies' offer , telling them instead that they could pay for school construction or provide money to the [ORG GOL  ] to implement programs . 
End note . 
) Unbidden , [PER Matari  ] offered that [ORG USAID  ] would , for example , almost certainly not be welcome to undertake programming in the east or elsewhere in [LOC Libya  ] . 
6 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Matari  ] , who holds a PhD from the [ORG University of Oregon  ] , is one of our most sophisticated and sympathetic interlocutors . 
His remarks underscore continuing [ORG GOL  ] neuralgia about any programming that implies the [ORG GOL  ] is unable or unwilling to provide for its people . 
The [ORG GOL  ] 's " traditional , quiet " channels for dealing with extremism comprise security organizations and , more recently , an increase in macro-economic development projects in eastern [LOC Libya  ] . 
The latter appears to reflect a belated realization that the policy of deliberately impoverishing the east to ensure political quiescence has not worked . 
The [ORG GOL  ] 's strategy appears to be to rely on security organizations to monitor eastern communities and mosques to contain the threat while engaging in significant infrastructure upgrades ( [LOC Benghazi  ] port renovation , [LOC Benghazi  ] and [LOC Derna  ] water and power upgrades ) and development projects ( the [ORG Green Mountain Eco-tourism  ] project ) to improve socio-economic conditions enough to blunt the appeal of extremist messages . 
As reported ref D , while senior regime figures appear to have recognized that the east merits more attention and investment , the reported ability of radical imams to propagate messages urging support for and participation in jihad despite security organizations' efforts suggests that claims by senior [ORG GOL  ] officials that the east is under control may be overstated . 
7 . 
( C ) Comment ( continued ) : Post 's efforts have focused on expanding host government [LOC CT  ] capacity through State , DHS and [ORG Treasury  ] programing in areas other than counter-ideology . 
These programs , in our view , hold more promise for gaining [MISC Libyan  ] cooperation . 
It is expected that a successful recent [ORG Diplomatic Security/Anti-Terrorism Assistance  ] ( [ORG DS/ATA  ] ) visit ( ref E ) will presage a robust program of anti-terrorism , law enforcement and judicial training that will bolster counter-terrorism efforts . 
Continued customs and border security training akin to a port security program the Embassy recently facilitated will contribute to the [ORG GOL  ] 's ability to better control its borders and monitor travelers , directly benefitting efforts to control foreign fighter flows .
