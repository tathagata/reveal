( [ORG U  ] ) Summary: [LOC Iceland  ] 's oldest aluminum smelter , owned by [MISC Canadian  ] aluminum conglomerate [ORG Alcan  ] , was denied permission to expand in a tight local referendum on March 31 . 
The planned expansion was one of three aluminum projects in various planning stages , including two new smelters proposed by [MISC American  ] firms [ORG Alcoa  ] and [ORG Century Aluminum  ] . 
Although environmentalists may seize on the results as a boost for their anti-aluminum campaign , in reality the result of the vote is likely a positive sign for the [LOC U.S.  ] projects . 
The economy could not sustain all three projects , but it needs some of them . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] projects enjoy local public support and are not located in areas with the same urban development issues . 
End Summary. ----------------------------------------- Enlargement would constrict town 's growth ----------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [ORG Alcan  ] aluminum smelter was opened in the town of [LOC Hafnarfjordur  ] , on the southern outskirts of [LOC Reykjavik  ] , by [MISC Swiss  ] [ORG Alusuisse  ] in 1969 and sold to [MISC Canadian  ] [ORG Alcan  ] in 2001 . 
Originally begun as a 30,000 tons/year operation , the smelter has been expanded several times and currently produces 180,000 tons/year . 
The planned expansion would have boosted the production capabilities to 460,000 tons/year , making it the biggest smelter in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
During the last thirty years the population in [LOC Hafnafjordur  ] expanded from 9,500 to 23,200 residents . 
[ORG Alcan  ] employs some 500 workers , who live in [LOC Reykjavik  ] and nearby municipalities. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The main debate regarding the expansion revolved around how the expansion would not only cause the smelter to reach very close to existing residential areas in [LOC Hafnarfjordur  ] , but would also block any further town expansion . 
Dilution zones ( the amount of area needed surrounding the plant to absorb emissions ) were widely debated ; [ORG Alcan  ] maintained that due to new scrubbing technologies the dilution zone would be smaller after the expansion than before . 
Opponents said the air pollution and environmental damage caused by expansion would reduce significantly the standard of living , as well as real estate prices , in the area . 
Pro-expansion arguments included the dramatic increase in the municipality 's income from the smelter and the positive effects on employment and industry . 
In addition , the CEO of the [ORG Alcan  ] smelter , [PER Rannveig Rist  ] , told the media that if the vote went against the expansion [ORG Alcan  ] would probably close down. ---------------- Lost by 88 votes ---------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Due to perceived widespread opposition to the expansion within the municipality and a lack of unity within the town council itself , the council decided a few months ago to put the decision before a referendum . 
All polls leading up to the March 31 eQction day indicated an extremely close vote , with both sides taking out full page newspaper ads and direct mail marketing of residents to persuade the vote . 
Voter turnout was very high ; of 16,647 eligible voters , 12,747 came to vote , or 76.6 percent . 
The expansion lost by a mere 88 votes , with 6382 of the voters ( 50.35 percent ) casting a " no " ballot versus 6294 votes ( 49.65 percent ) on the other side . 
The result was a great disappointment for [ORG Alcan  ] and CEO [PER Rist  ] told media that there was " no existing plan B " for the smelter and without the expansion there might not be grounds for continuing operations in the long run. ------------------------------- Environmentalists claim victory ------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Environmentalists celebrated the result of the vote as a victory for the environment and [PER Steingrimur J. Sigfusson  ] , Chairman of the [ORG Left Green Party  ] , claimed that it reflected the rising environmental consciousness of [LOC Iceland  ] . 
Activists and the green political parties told the media the vote showed that the people of [LOC Iceland  ] have had enough of heavy industry projects such as aluminum smelters and the power plants that are built to power them . 
While this vote was a local referendum in [LOC Hafnarfjordur  ] , and a very close call , [PER Sigfusson  ] claims that this is a far bigger victory for the environmentalists than the government is willing to admit. ---------------------------------- [LOC U.S.  ] companies likely not affected ---------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Two other aluminum smelters in [LOC Iceland  ] are owned by [LOC U.S.  ] firms ( reftel ) . 
[ORG Century Aluminum  ] in the southwest near the town of [LOC Akranes  ] has a production capacity of 220,000 tons/yr and [ORG Alcoa  ] in the northeast , which begins production in June , will have a capacity of 346,000 tons/yr . 
Both Century and [ORG Alcoa  ] have expressed their intent to build new smelters in [LOC Iceland  ] ; Century plans a new smelter near the old [LOC U.S.  ] military base in [LOC Reykjanesbaer  ] , and [ORG Alcoa  ] wants one near [LOC Husavik  ] in the north . 
Both projects have the support of the respective local residents , but face opposition from environmental groups and green minded political parties who strongly oppose further big-scale industrial projects in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
According to [PER Gunnar Haraldsson  ] , the Director of the University of [LOC Iceland  ] 's [ORG Institute of Economic Studies  ] , the economy could not sustain two new smelters and the [ORG Alcan  ] expansion , but it needs one or two of the projects to sustain the growing economy. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Of the two [LOC U.S.  ] projects , the Century project is further along . 
Century has submitted an [ORG Environmental Impact Assessment  ] which is open to review by the municipalities involved , the [ORG National Planning Agency  ] , the [ORG Environment Agency  ] , and the general public . 
Proposed changes to the local development and zoning plan have been submitted by the town council of [LOC Reykjanesbaer  ] , which supports the project , and the plans are now open for public comment . 
Century has signed an energy contract with the [ORG Sudurnes Energy Company  ] for the first stage of the smelter , due to be operational in 2010 , and is currently in negotiations with [ORG Reykjavik Energy  ] for the purchase of energy for the second stage . 
( [ORG Note:  ] The Century project is on the same part of the electrical grid as the [ORG Alcan  ] smelter . 
With [ORG Alcan  ] 's expansion plans off the table , Century has stated to the media that it is willing to purchase all the energy that was to be sold to [ORG Alcan  ] for the expansion . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [ORG Alcoa  ] project is not as far along in preparation . 
That project seems to face far more opposition on environmental terms , because it is to be built in a more pristine area and the firm is already unpopular due to negative publicity surrounding their current aluminum smelter and the [MISC Karahnjukar  ] hydropower project that was built for it . 
The [ORG Alcoa  ] project entered the third phase of its feasibility study on April 18 . 
The parties to the original declaration of intent for the smelter , [ORG Alcoa  ] , the [ORG Ministry of Industry  ] , and the municipality of [LOC Husavik  ] , all agreed that the feasibility studies were promising thus far and should be continued. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: Environmental activists have heralded the Alcan/Hafnarfjordur vote as the first step towards a halt to heavy industry 's growth in [LOC Iceland  ] , and hope to use that momentum to sweep the current government out in national parliamentary elections on May 12 . 
It is not clear , however , that voters nationwide will make the same calculations as [LOC Hafnarfjordur  ] residents when they head to the polls . 
The outlook for [LOC U.S.  ] firms' plans is fuzzy , but not automatically negative . 
Local sentiment in [LOC Husavik  ] , for example , is far more pro-smelter than the overall feeling in [LOC Hafnarfjordur  ] . 
If the next [MISC Icelandic  ] government continues the current [MISC GOI  ] policy of devolving authority to town councils on such matters , the vote in [LOC Hafnarfjordur  ] may not have any impact on [ORG Century Aluminum  ] 's or [ORG Alcoa  ] 's plans .
