( U ) This is the second of two cables reviewing [LOC Iraq  ] 's relations with key neighboring countries. this cable focuses on [LOC Iraq  ] 's relations with [LOC Syria  ] , in the wake of the August 19 bombings. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Summary: [LOC Iraq  ] 's improving relations with its neighbors in 2008 and early 2009 represented a critical element in its efforts to maintain security and stability and normalize its position in the [LOC Gulf  ] and the broader region . 
The August 19 bombings -- targeting the [ORG MFA  ] , and by extension [LOC Iraq  ] 's improving relations with its neighbors -- represent a serious setback and have alarmed senior [MISC Iraqi  ] officials , suggesting that [MISC Iraqi  ] [PER Sunni Arab  ] neighbors in particular now view those earlier gains as " reversible . 
" These fears help explain the rapid deterioration in relations with [LOC Syria  ] and the [ORG GOI  ] 's demand that the [ORG UN  ] intervene to investigate the August 19 bombings , so as to put [LOC Syria  ] on notice that the international community is scrutinizing its use of [MISC Iraqi  ] Ba'athist proxies to interfere in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[LOC Iraq  ] 's relations [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , [LOC Kuwait  ] , [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Turkey  ] are covered in Part I of this message . 
End Summary . 
PROGRESS WITH THE NEIGHBORS , 2008-09 ------------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) From 2008 through much of the summer , [LOC Iraq  ] 's relations with its neighbors were on a positive trajectory overall . 
The breakthroughs in regional engagement began in the fall of 2008 ( following sustained USG pressure ) , with the [LOC UAE  ] , [LOC Bahrain  ] , and [LOC Kuwait  ] all sending ambassadors to [LOC Baghdad  ] , along with [LOC Jordan  ] , the [ORG Arab League  ] , and [LOC Syria  ] . 
[LOC Iraq  ] also began its regular participation in the [ORG GCC  ] 3 in 2008 . 
While there was less formal movement in 2009 , the positive trend continued , as the [ORG GOI  ] named 58 new ambassadors and the [MISC Egyptian  ] government took steps to return its ambassador . 
The continuing signs of improvement in security in [LOC Iraq  ] in 2008 and the first half of 2009 provided a growing sense that [LOC Iraq  ] was becoming a much more secure place and getting strong enough to ward off , or at least better control , neighbors' meddling in its internal affairs. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) However , not all the trendlines were positive during this period . 
Despite pressure from us , the [MISC Saudis  ] refused to send an ambassador ( although they received [LOC Iraq  ] 's ambassador in [LOC Riyadh  ] ) , reflecting [LOC Riyadh  ] 's and [PER King Abdullah  ] 's , in particular , deep-seated doubts about a [MISC Shia-led  ] democracy in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Relations with other key countries in the region , including [LOC Syria  ] , [LOC Kuwait  ] , and even [LOC Turkey  ] , also experienced varying degrees of drag on positive movement , ranging from foreign fighters issues in [LOC Syria  ] to [ORG Chapter VII  ] issues in [LOC Kuwait  ] and water shortfalls from [LOC Turkey  ] . 
The perception among many [MISC Iraqis  ] during this period was that despite the gains in normalization and regional integration , [LOC Iraq  ] was a pitiful ( former ) regional giant , preyed upon and held back in various ways by neighbors intent on keeping it weak and taking advantage of it . 
AUGUST 19: A THREAT TO NORMALIZATION TRENDS ------------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The August 19 bombings which severely damaged the [ORG MFA  ] and the [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] buildings and [LOC Baghdad  ] 's residents' sense of improving security , brought these negative trendlines into sharp relief . 
The bombings undercut the perception of normalization that had become a commonplace over the past eighteen months ( and undercut PM [PER Maliki  ] 's platform of having delivered on security ) . 
[MISC Iraqis  ] , both official and unofficial , believe it was no accident that one of the main targets , and the one that suffered the most Qof the main targets , and the one that suffered the most damage , is the [ORG MFA  ] , symbol of [LOC Iraq  ] 's efforts to build relations with its neighbors and normalize its position in the region. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In the immediate aftermath of the bombings , FM [ORG Zebari  ] made accusations that one or more of the neighboring countries had conspired with al-Qaeda , possibly using proxies , to support the bombings . 
In a meeting with the Ambassador , PM [PER Maliki  ] referred to a " momentum of interference " that was building in the lead-up to the January national elections . 
[ORG Zebari  ] described the next 5-6 month time-frame as " a period of maximum danger " for [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The bombings were meant to convey the perception -- welcomed by some neighbors , he insisted -- that the security and normalization in [LOC Iraq  ] of the past two years were " reversible . 
" DO THE NEIGHBORS HAVE IT IN FOR [LOC IRAQ  ] ? ------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [MISC Iraqi  ] contacts speculated that regional unease about [LOC BAGHDAD  ] 00002561 002 OF 002 a [MISC Shia-led Iraqi  ] government , and about the democratic character of that government , a model that could eventually undermine the legitimacy of more autocratic regimes in the region , helped explain why some neighbors would prefer a weak and unstable [LOC Iraq  ] , where security and political gains of the past two years are rolled back . 
Acting [ORG NSC Advisor Dr. Safa  ] al-Sheikh described the neighbors as bent on intervening in [LOC Iraq  ] , especially in the months leading up to the January 2010 elections . 
While some used proxies to foment violence , others restricted themselves to money , media ( propaganda ) , and meddling , all designed to help shape electoral coalitions , and block or further individual political careers , in order to better control [LOC Iraq  ] and keep it weak , politically fractured , and pliable , insisted al-Sheikh . 
PM [PER Maliki  ] told the Ambassador that neighbors feared a resurgent [LOC Iraq  ] that would capture too much of " the limelight . 
" According to [PER Maliki  ] , neighbors also feared [LOC Iraq  ] 's " golden connection between [LOC Shia  ] and [PER Sunni Islam  ] , " a legacy that gives [LOC Iraq  ] special precedence in the region . 
His argument is based on a well-acknowledged fact that [LOC Iraq  ] is the grand junction of [LOC Shia  ] and [PER Sunni Islam  ] as well as of the [MISC Arab  ] world and [LOC Persia  ] , making it , therefore , both strategically vital but also vulnerable . 
The view of key contacts here is that some of [LOC Iraq  ] 's [PER Sunni Arab  ] neighbors have concluded that in a stable , peaceful [MISC Iraqi  ] democracy , [PER Sunni  ] political power in [LOC Iraq  ] would be finished . 
These [MISC Arab  ] neighbors , therefore , conclude that the only way the [MISC Sunnis  ] will ever come back into power in [LOC Iraq  ] is in the wake of a period of sustained instability and violence that de-legitimizes democratic governance and the [LOC Shia  ] as [MISC Iraqi  ] political leaders . 
RELATIONS WITH [LOC SYRIA  ] IN CRISIS ------------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Relations with [LOC Syria  ] suffered the most precipitous decline in the wake of the attacks , with mutual recalls of Ambassadors and public statements making clear the [ORG GOI  ] felt [LOC Syria  ] was complicit . 
While [MISC Syrian  ] support for [MISC Iraqi Ba'athists  ] has long been a significant bilateral irritant , the [ORG GOI  ] 's public claim that [MISC Syrian-based  ] insurgents were responsible for August 19 represented a significant shift . 
To the al-Maliki government , the problem was now seen as an existential threat to the state and the [ORG GOI  ] could no longer treat the issue with routine diplomacy , especially given fears these attacks were only the first wave . 
According to [PER Maliki  ] and al-Sheikh , senior [MISC Iraqi  ] security officers had seen a growing body of intelligence in the months leading up to attacks indicating significant cooperation between [MISC Iraqi Ba'athists  ] and al-Qaeda , although Sheikh acknowledged that the proof for [MISC Iraqi Ba'athist  ] involvement in the August 19 bombings had been assembled " somewhat quickly . 
" He explained that at the cell level , [MISC Ba'athists  ] participate with some al-Qaida groups -- usually disguising their Baathist sympathies -- and often dominate the local groups because they have highly prized skills such as experience handling weapons and explosives. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [MISC Iraqi  ] officials make clear that despite the current problems with [LOC Syria  ] , they foresee the possibility of improved relations in the future . 
PM [PER Maliki  ] recently stated that [LOC Iraq  ] wanted a harder-line USG policy toward [LOC Syria  ] only to the extent it would help compel [LOC Syria  ] to stop misbehaving and be a better neighbor . 
The problem , according to [PER Maliki  ] and others , is that [LOC Syria  ] is a neighborhood menace with a history of fomenting violence and inciting instability in the region -- and it viewed these tactics as part of the standard tools Q-- and it viewed these tactics as part of the standard tools of diplomacy . 
[LOC Iraq  ] 's problem is that it is too weak on its own to intimidate [LOC Syria  ] into behaving . 
With no troops " to mass on the border " as a threat , as [LOC Turkey  ] had once done , and taking his cue from [LOC Lebanon  ] 's experience following the [ORG Hariri  ] assassination , [PER Maliki  ] felt he had no recourse but to take the issue to the [ORG UNSC  ] , hoping this diplomatic " stick " might persuade [PER Bashar  ] and his regime to back off . 
[LOC Iraq  ] is looking to the [LOC United States  ] and other members of the P-5 to endorse the appointment by the UNSYG of a senior official to investigate the August 19 bombings and external support for terrorism in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
( NOTE: Not all [MISC Iraqi  ] officials agreed with the PM 's approach . 
On September 5 , [LOC Iraq  ] 's three presidents -- [PER Talabani  ] , [PER Hashimi  ] and Abd al-Mahdi -- issued a statement calling for containing tension between [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Syria  ] through diplomatic channels , an obvious rejection of [PER Maliki  ] 's insistence on [ORG UN  ] involvement .
