<code><pre>S E C R E T ANKARA 001472 NOFORN SIPDIS OSD FOR ASD VERSHBOW FROM AMBASSADOR [PER JEFFREY E.O.  ] 12958: [LOC DECL:  ] 10/07/2019 TAGS: <a href='/tag/PREL_0.html'>PREL</a> <a href='/tag/PARM_0.html'>PARM</a> <a href='/tag/PTER_0.html'>PTER</a> <a href='/tag/TU_0.html'>TU</a> SUBJECT: SCENESETTER: YOUR VISIT TO [ORG TURKEY Classified  ] By: Ambassador [PER James F. Jeffrey  ] reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Sandy  ] , [PER Glad  ] you'll be able to visit [LOC Turkey  ] at this key time . 
Your short visit will give you an opportunity to engage with key [MISC Turkish  ] leaders on , first and foremost in their minds , missile defense . 
The [LOC Turks  ] are keen to learn more about [LOC U.S.  ] plans , in particular what role the [LOC U.S.  ] wants/expects [LOC Turkey  ] and others in [LOC Europe  ] to play . 
The [MISC Turkish  ] General Staff ( TGS ) will be interested in our ideas for [LOC HLDG  ] reform , even if they may be slow to accept them. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) You know how broad our agenda is with [LOC Turkey  ] . 
As you will have a short time in country , I suggest you focus on a few key issues . 
Be sure to raise: ------------------ - [ORG Missile Defense  ] , with emphasis on how the [LOC U.S.  ] will look to several Allies - not just [LOC Turkey  ] - for help ( para 3 ) - Repeat our commitment to our intel and other support for strikes against the [ORG PKK  ] ( para 5-6 ) - Appreciation for [LOC Turkey  ] 's efforts on Afghanistan/Pakistan ( para 13 ) - Float the idea of [LOC HLDG  ] reform and ensure [PER Guner  ] knows we expect him in [LOC Washington  ] ( para 4 ) - Press for a realistic assessment of [LOC Turkey  ] 's view of the threat assessment from [LOC Iran  ] ( para 10 ) [MISC Watch Out For:  ] --------------- - Pressure for direct [LOC U.S.  ] milops against the [ORG PKK  ] ( paras 11-12 ) - Conflation of [LOC Turkey  ] 's exploration of air defense capabilities with our [ORG Missile Defense  ] needs ( para 3 ) [ORG Missile Defense  ] ---------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [LOC Turks  ] will appreciate your update on [LOC U.S.  ] missile defense plans and in particular will expect you to have specific ideas on how [LOC Turkey  ] would contribute to the [ORG PAA  ] . 
While the top-level bureaucrats with whom you will meet will understand the rationale for the [ORG PAA  ] and will be ready to explore ways [LOC Turkey  ] can help , the political environment for a request to base assets in [LOC Turkey  ] is mixed , and [LOC Turkey  ] 's perception of the [MISC Iranian  ] threat to its territory differs from ours . 
The GOT continues to tread a fine line in managing its strong relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] and its ties with both the [MISC Islamic  ] world and [LOC Russia  ] . 
The government must be able to demonstrate that any missile defense program is not specifically anti-Iran , nor blatantly pro-Israel. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Likewise , it will want to ensure that [LOC Russia  ] is not opposed to [LOC Turkey  ] 's role . 
Also important will be clarity on the degree to which this system is a [ORG NATO  ] one , under [ORG NATO Command and Control  ] ( C2 ) . 
The [ORG PAA  ] would presumably complement [LOC Turkey  ] 's effort to establish a domestic missile defense capability that would protect [LOC Turkey  ] 's major population centers . 
The [MISC PAC-3  ] has been offered in response to [LOC Turkey  ] 's air defense tender and you should highlight the system 's ability to be interoperable with any future [ORG NATO  ] command and control architecture . 
[LOC HLDG  ] ----- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) You will need to outline [LOC U.S.  ] views to streamline and alter the current [LOC HLDG  ] format to make it into a more substantive discussion . 
The [LOC Turks  ] are shy to stray from the status quo ; you should emphasize why we feel this change is necessary while underscoring that it is vitally important the DCHOD [PER Guner  ] attend the upcoming [LOC HLDG  ] in December , when decisions about future dialogues will be agreed upon . 
( We have learned that the new position of TGS number three , a four-star slot held by General [PER Balanli  ] ( with a focus on hardware ) , might get the nod for the [LOC HLDG  ] representative . 
We 've told [PER Guner  ] it should be his . 
) You should also be prepared for the [MISC Turkish  ] General Staff to raise the [ORG Shared Defense Vision  ] document , as they await a response to their latest proposed text . 
[ORG PKK  ] ---- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [LOC Turkey  ] 's counter-terrorist efforts against the [ORG PKK  ] have evolved in the past year and have expanded beyond military action alone . 
Although the government 's [MISC Democratic  ] ( i.e. , [MISC Kurdish  ] ) Initiative is not yet fully developed , the government has increased social and economic support to ethnic [MISC Kurds  ] in southeast [LOC Turkey  ] , has dramatically broadened the rights of [MISC Kurds  ] to use their own language , and increased educational opportunities as well . 
It is our view that the TGS military success against the [ORG PKK  ] , supported by our intelligence--sharing operation , has given the civilians the political space to explore this " opening . 
" [MISC Turkish  ] military operations against the [ORG PKK  ] continue , however , and on October 6 Parliament extended the government 's mandate to conduct cross-border operations against the [ORG PKK  ] in [LOC Iraq  ] for another year. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Our 2007 decision to share operational intelligence was a turning point for the bilateral relationship , and President [PER Obama  ] 's declaration before the [MISC Turkish  ] Parliament of our continuing commitment to support [LOC Turkey  ] 's fight against the [ORG PKK  ] was warmly welcomed . 
This cooperation has helped to improve our bilateral relationship across the board . 
[LOC Turkey  ] 's military leaders value this intelligence and the advice our military leaders give them . 
Our work has made it difficult for [ORG PKK  ] terrorists to use northern [LOC Iraq  ] as a safe haven . 
[MISC Turkish  ] causalities are still occurring , however , and an increasing proportion are from IEDs . 
Due to pressure on Chief of Staff General Basbug and the [MISC Turkish  ] General Staff ( TGS ) to " finish off " the [ORG PKK  ] this year , the government wants and has requested direct [LOC U.S.  ] kinetic action against the [ORG PKK  ] ; we have refused this request to date due to our own rules of engagement . 
The GOT has also requested the sale of armed [MISC MQ-9/Reaper UAVs  ] , which will be a challenge to fulfill ( see para 10 ) . 
Northern [LOC Iraq  ] -------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [LOC Turkey  ] will not consider any alternative to the political unity and territorial integrity of [LOC Iraq  ] , but has become more flexible on how it engages " the local authorities of northern [LOC Iraq  ] " ( how [LOC Turkey  ] refers officially to the [MISC Kurdish  ] [LOC Regional Government  ] ( [ORG KRG  ] ) ) . 
[LOC Turkey  ] 's policy remains focused on the government in [LOC Baghdad  ] , but its outreach to the [ORG KRG  ] is expanding . 
This outreach is reinforced by the continued dominance of [MISC Turkish  ] products and investments in the [ORG KRG  ] 's healthy economy . 
It is also tied to turkey 's new opening to its own [MISC Kurds  ] , by far the biggest and most controversial domestic political issue here. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG U.S.-Turkey-Iraq Tripartite Security  ] talks continue regularly and a new [ORG Tripartite  ] operational office in [LOC Erbil  ] , established to share counter-PKK intelligence was established over the summer . 
The [LOC Turks  ] remain shy to share data ; they are not convinced that they can trust [MISC Iraqi/Kurdish  ] individuals to keep information concerning operations secret . 
Nevertheless , it is a step in the right direction . 
[MISC Turkish  ] military officials have become more strident in their calls for [ORG KRG  ] officials to take action against the [ORG PKK  ] . 
[LOC U.S.  ] Drawdown through [LOC Turkey  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [LOC Habur Gate  ] and the [ORG Incirlik Cargo Hub  ] -- vital to our sustainment operations -- could be helpful in our drawdown if other options prove too difficult . 
Minister of [ORG National Defense Vedci Gonul  ] suggested to Secretary Gates in June that [LOC Turkey  ] was ready to agree to the increased use of [LOC Incirlik  ] for this purpose . 
Using the surface route from [LOC Habur Gate  ] to [MISC Mediterranean  ] ports ( [LOC Iskenderun  ] , [LOC Mersin  ] ) is also worth exploring , and we may be able to involve [MISC Turkish  ] commercial shippers in support of the [ORG Northern Distribution Network  ] . 
We caution that the rough terrain , security environment , and the cantankerous nature of the [MISC Turkish  ] government bureaucracy will challenge any [LOC U.S.  ] operation . 
Nevertheless , we are evaluating these options in cooperation with [ORG CENTCOM  ] and [ORG EUCOM  ] partners . 
[LOC Iran  ] ------ <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [LOC Turkey  ] understands and partially shares [LOC U.S.  ] and international concerns about [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear ambitions , but is hesitant to use harsh language in public statements , in part due to its dependence on [LOC Iran  ] as an energy supplier and as a trade route to [LOC Central Asian  ] markets . 
PM [PER Erdogan  ] himself is a particularly vocal skeptic of the [LOC U.S.  ] position . 
[LOC Turkey  ] believes international pressure against [LOC Iran  ] only helps to strengthen [PER Ahmadinejad  ] and the hard-liners . 
However , it continues to press [LOC Iran  ] quietly to accept the [MISC P5  ] plus 1 offer . 
The GOT is a strong partner in our non-proliferation efforts , with several significant results . 
Politically , [LOC Turkey  ] will try to position itself on [LOC Iran  ] between wherever we are and where [LOC Russia  ] is . 
In a pinch or if pressed , the [LOC Turks  ] will slant to us . 
UAVs and [ORG Attack Helicopters  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [LOC Turkey  ] seeks to acquire , on an urgent basis , its own UAV capability . 
The administration has made clear at high levels that we support this goal , and [LOC Turkey  ] has pending request to acquire armed Reaper UAVs . 
Ultimate approval for armed Reapers is complicated due to MTCR obligations and Hill concerns . 
However , even if those could be overcome , the delivery pipeline for these systems is long , and [LOC Turkey  ] 's leaders have sought reassurance that we will not pull our intelligence support until they can replace it . 
We have not made this commitment to date. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Additionally , bad procurement decisions led [LOC Turkey  ] to a severe shortage of attack helicopters , desperately needed for its fight against the [ORG PKK  ] [LOC Turkey  ] has looked to us to help them bridge the capability gap , asking to purchase additional [ORG AH-1W Super Cobra  ] aircraft . 
These aircraft are in short supply in our own inventory , but Secretary Gates and [PER VCJCS Cartwright  ] have promised to try to support with request within a few years ( four each in 2011 , 2012 , and 2013 ) . 
The [LOC Turks  ] took this as an affirmative , and recently started pressing for delivery in 2010 instead of 2011 . 
Afghanistan/Pakistan ---------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [LOC Turkey  ] has commanded [ORG ISAF  ] twice since its inception and will take command of RC-Capital this November . 
[LOC Turkey  ] leads [ORG PRT Wardak  ] and plans to open a second [ORG PRT  ] in [LOC Jawzjan  ] in early 2010 . 
[LOC Turkey  ] has sponsored the " [MISC Ankara Process  ] " dialogue , one of several efforts to encourage constructive communications between [LOC Kabul  ] and [LOC Islamabad  ] and is a leading participant in the Friends of [LOC Democratic Pakistan  ] . 
[LOC Turkey  ] pledged significant aid to both countries: [MISC USD  ] 200 million to [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [MISC USD  ] 100 million to [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
Because of its culture , history and religious orientation , as well as Foreign Minister [PER Davutoglu  ] 's strategic ambition , [LOC Turkey  ] is well disposed to act as an agent of the international community 's goals in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
Constraining [LOC Turkey  ] 's potential is a lack of resources . 
Our conversations with [MISC Turkish  ] interlocutors have helped us identify several areas in which [LOC Turkey  ] can be of particular help: education and health , military training and support , economics , counter-narcotics , and trilateral engagement . 
( Note: [LOC Turkey  ] will not support any [LOC CT  ] operations in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
They do not believe there is a [MISC NATO/ISAF  ] mandate to engage in these operations , and they additionally have national caveats preventing them from participating in [MISC NATO/ISAF  ] [LOC CT  ] operations . 
The GOT also believes that [ORG ISAF  ] should not/not be engaged in the counter-narcotics fight , believing that foreign fighters who engage in this fight just produces antipathy against foreign forces in the local population . 
I do , however , believe the GOT are willing to engage the training of [MISC Afghan  ] security forces . 
) [LOC Caucasus  ] -------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [LOC Turkey  ] seeks to develop itself as a regional power and recognizes that the [LOC Caucasus  ] region , stymied in its growth by frozen conflicts , could turn to [LOC Turkey  ] for develop . 
The signing of the Protocol document in [LOC Zurich  ] on October 10 was a landmark for the region , and should serve as a starting point for establishing bilateral relations and , ultimately , the opening of its closed border . 
Nevertheless , future relations will still be heavily linked to the 1915 " genocide " issue and the resolution of the [LOC Nagorno-Karabakh  ] conflict between [LOC Armenia  ] and [LOC Azerbaijan  ] . 
[LOC Turkey  ] consistently warns that any [LOC U.S.  ] determination of the events of 1915 as " genocide " would set off a political firestorm in [LOC Turkey  ] , and the devastating effect on our bilateral relationship -- including political , military , and commercial aspects -- would be unavoidable . 
Political Environment ---------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) PM [PER Erdogan  ] 's [ORG Islamist-leaning Justice and Development  ] ( [ORG AK  ] ) Party is squarely in the driver 's seat , but fears an erosion of its political base from more conservative/Islamist parties . 
Civilian-military relations remain complex . 
Chief of Staff General [PER Basbug  ] has worked out a modus vivendi with PM [PER Erdogan  ] , but the long-running struggle between [LOC Turkey  ] 's secularists ( with the [ORG Army  ] as its champion ) and [MISC Islamists  ] ( represented by the government ) naturally puts them at odds . 
[PER Erdogan  ] has the clear upper hand , a fact with which [PER Basbug  ] has seemingly learned to live . 
Alleged past military involvement in coup contingency planning or even deliberate generation of internal chaos remains political theme number one and preoccupies both [PER Erdogan  ] and [PER Basbug  ] and their respective underlings . 
[LOC Israel  ] ------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) While the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] and the [MISC Turkish  ] General Staff agree with us that a strong [MISC Turkey-Israel  ] relationship is essential for regional stability , PM [PER Erdogan  ] has sought to shore up his domestic right political flank at the expense of this relationship . 
His outburst at [LOC Davos  ] was the first in a series of events the results of which we and his staff have sought to contain . 
The latest of these was [ORG Exercise Anatolian Eagle  ] . 
[PER Erdogan  ] canceled [LOC Israel  ] 's participation hours before the exercise was to begin . 
With an [MISC Israeli  ] strike - across [MISC Turkish  ] airspace - against targets in [LOC Iran  ] a possibility , [PER Erdogan  ] decided he could not afford the political risk of being accused of training the forces which would carry out such a raid . 
Through some remarkable work with [ORG Allies  ] and with the inter-agency , we engineered a public " postponement " of the international portion of the exercise , but the relationship has begun to sour .
