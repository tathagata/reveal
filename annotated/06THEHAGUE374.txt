( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY: In August 2005 , Post established an [MISC Integration Issues Working Group  ] ( [ORG IIWG  ] ) to coordinate outreach and reporting activities related to the [MISC Dutch  ] [MISC Muslim  ] community . 
This approach succeeded in considerably expanding [ORG Embassy The Hague  ] 's and Consul General [LOC Amsterdam  ] 's contacts in the [MISC Dutch  ] [MISC Muslim  ] community as well as among government , academic , and think-tank circles . 
Mission has also significantly increased reporting on [MISC Dutch  ] Muslim-related issues . 
This cable summarizes highlights from the last six months and describes new opportunities for further mission outreach . 
END SUMMARY . 
TOP MISSION PRIORITY -------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In accordance with [LOC Washington  ] guidance , mission has made engaging with the [MISC Dutch  ] [MISC Muslim  ] community a top priority , as reflected in the just-completed FY 2008 MPP . 
Mission efforts are focused around three prime objectives: - Improving the image of the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] policies among the increasingly influential -- and largely anti-American -- [MISC Dutch  ] [MISC Muslim  ] community ; - Increasing our understanding of issues of concern to the [MISC Dutch  ] [MISC Muslim  ] community and similar communities elsewhere in [LOC Europe  ] , including relations with the non-Muslim majority ; - Using the [LOC U.S.  ] experience to help foster a productive , non-confrontational dialogue between [MISC Muslim  ] and non-Muslim [MISC Dutch  ] on sensitive issues of integration and civil rights . 
COORDINATED APPROACH -------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Since August 2005 , Mission activities in pursuit of the above goals have been coordinated through biweekly meetings of the [MISC Integration Issues Working Group  ] ( [ORG IIWG  ] ) . 
The [MISC Working Group  ] reports to the Charge d'Affaires , is chaired by [ORG POLCOUNS  ] , and includes representatives from [LOC PD  ] , [ORG POL  ] , [ORG ECON  ] , FCS , Global , [ORG RSO  ] and [ORG CG Amsterdam  ] . 
The [MISC Working Group  ] approach has significantly enhanced the quality and quantity of mission reporting and outreach by encouraging sections to share resources , contacts , and experiences while promoting creative cross-section initiatives. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Under the direction of the [ORG IIWG  ] , mission elements have taken a number of practical steps to facilitate coordination , including: - the creation of a mission-wide calendar of current and upcoming events related to the [MISC Muslim  ] community ; - increased access to the mission 's contact data base , and the creation of specific lists of [MISC Muslim  ] and Muslim-related contacts to which all elements can add names ; - production of a power-point presentation on the [MISC Muslim  ] Community in the [LOC Netherlands  ] , which is regularly updated and to which all sections have access. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Mission has also benefited from the services of two long-term [ORG TDY  ] personnel ( one [ORG Presidential Management Intern  ] followed by a three-month [ORG TDY  ] from S/CT ) devoted full time to [MISC Muslim  ] community issues . 
In addition to their own impressive outreach and reporting efforts , these individuals provided critical communication and coordination support between mission elements , and served as a useful first point of contact and liaison between the mission and the [MISC Dutch  ] [MISC Muslim  ] community . 
Post has proposed in the current MPP establishing a new IROG position to continue these functions on a more permanent and ultimately less expensive basis . 
REPORTING --------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The heightened focus on [MISC Muslim  ] issues is reflected in mission reporting . 
In the last six months , [ORG Embassy The Hague  ] and [ORG ConGen Amsterdam  ] have produced 27 cables related to [MISC Muslim  ] community issues . 
Of these , only two - The [MISC Hague  ] 2651 ( 2005 ) and The [MISC Hague  ] 2705 ( 2005 ) , both dealing with [MISC Islamic  ] Extremism -- responded directly to [LOC Washington  ] taskings . 
The rest , beginning with a broad overview of the [MISC Dutch  ] [MISC Muslim  ] community ( The [MISC Hague  ] 2599 ( 2005 ) ) were either generated by post outreach initiatives or responded to specific developments such as the recent controversy over the [MISC Danish  ] cartoons ( The [MISC Hague  ] 257 , 303 , 314 , and 357 ) . 
Other subjects THE [MISC HAGUE  ] 00000374 002 OF 003 covered in post reporting include: - [MISC Dutch  ] legislative efforts to combat radicalism ( The [MISC Hague  ] 2648 , 2793 , and 2850 ( 2005 ) ) ; - Profiles of prominent [MISC Muslims  ] and [MISC Muslim  ] organizations ( [LOC Amsterdam  ] 720 ( 2005 ) , The [MISC Hague  ] 3277 , 3340 ( 2005 ) and 308 ) ; - Social/Economic/Political aspects of the integration debate ( The [MISC Hague  ] 3008 , 3064,3069 , 3381 ( 2005 ) , 141 , 149 ) ; - Mission outreach initiatives ( The [MISC Hague  ] 2587 , 3084 , 3087 , 3128 , 3331 ( 2005 ) , 228 ) . <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Muslim  ] community issues are also prominently featured in the daily press summary produced by the [MISC Public Diplomacy  ] section , the Political [ORG Section  ] 's daily Politics in the [LOC Netherlands  ] e-mail , and the Global [ORG Section  ] 's weekly e-mail summary of issues . 
In addition , the [ORG Information Research Center  ] ( [ORG IRC  ] ) has begun to circulate two new products via e-mail: - [MISC Integration Issues Working Group  ] Alert: a bi-weekly summary of recently published articles in the [MISC Dutch  ] and international press , with links ; and - [MISC Dutch  ] Integration Issues Review: a bi-weekly compilation of [MISC Muslim  ] Community-related stories from the three products mentioned above . 
( [PER Note: Recipients  ] of this cable who wish to be added to the circulation lists for the above products should e-mail their requests to ircthehague@state.gov . 
All products will also shortly be available at post 's SIPRNET site: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/eur/thehague/ . 
OUTREACH -------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) At the direction of the front office , all mission elements have made reaching out to the [MISC Dutch  ] [MISC Muslim  ] community a top priority and have worked to incorporate outreach goals into their usual routines . 
For example , sections have been encouraged to add [MISC Dutch  ] [MISC Muslim  ] guests to receptions and other events whenever possible . 
Where appropriate , officials visitors have been encouraged to visit [MISC Muslim  ] neighborhoods and make contact with [MISC Dutch  ] [MISC Muslim  ] contacts directly . 
Post has also taken full advantage of [MISC Fulbright  ] grants , [MISC IVPs  ] , and other exchange programs to identify and develop contacts in the [MISC Dutch  ] [MISC Muslim  ] community . 
For example , 5 out of 15 [MISC IVPs  ] in FY 2006 were awarded to [MISC Dutch  ] [MISC Muslim  ] contacts , and the number of [LOC Fulbright  ] grant applications with non-Dutch last named -- a largely [MISC Muslim  ] subset -- rose to 27 during the early application cycle in September 2005 , with one selected ; during the previous application cycle , 0 such applications were received . 
Post has programmed two [MISC American  ] speakers with a focus on the [MISC Muslim  ] community , and has used occasions such as [PER Martin Luther King  ] 's Birthday and [ORG Black History Month  ] to schedule events with a civil-rights focus of interest to [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG Muslims.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Mission has worked with local [MISC Muslim  ] organizations such as Forum and [MISC MEX-it  ] to identify opportunities for person-to-person contact . 
During the month of [MISC Ramadan  ] , for example , Embassy the [MISC Hague  ] and [ORG ConGen Amsterdam  ] actively participated in a series of events organized by [MISC MEX-it  ] , including 19 Iftar dinners hosted by local [MISC Muslim  ] families ( ref a ) . 
In November , [ORG ConGen Amsterdam  ] hosted an inter-faith Thanksgiving service in [LOC Amsterdam  ] and invited a local [MISC Imam.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Starting in January , 2006 , Charge has hosted a series of themed lunches with 8 - 10 guests on issues relevant to the [MISC Muslim  ] community , which have further expanded mission contacts as well as reporting opportunities . 
Subjects covered to date include: - [MISC Islamic  ] Education in the [LOC Netherlands  ] ; - Business/Commercial/Economic Opportunities for [MISC Dutch  ] Muslims ; - Immigrant Participation in Politics ; - [ORG Dutch Muslim Media Representatives  ] ( 2 lunches ) ; Future lunches are planned on themes including: - [ORG Dutch-Muslim Literary/Cultural Life  ] ; - Outreach to [MISC Muslims  ] in [MISC Dutch  ] Foreign Policy ; - [MISC Muslim  ] Women in the [LOC Netherlands  ] ; - Imam-training Programs in the [LOC Netherlands  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Since August , mission 's list of [MISC Muslim  ] and Muslim-related contacts has increased from 50 to 131 -- and THE [MISC HAGUE  ] 00000374 003 OF 003 is still growing . 
Mission personnel have participated in over 85 events since August -- conferences , individual meetings , speaker programs , etc. -- with a primary focus on the [MISC Dutch Muslim  ] community . 
Post recently initiated contact with the largest [MISC Muslim  ] high-school in the country , in [LOC Rotterdam  ] , and is exploring ways to expand this relationship -- for example , by inviting students to visit a [LOC U.S.  ] Navy ship scheduled to call at [LOC Rotterdam  ] in [LOC March.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG FCS  ] is applying service and outreach programs to inform [MISC Muslim  ] and other [MISC Dutch  ] minority audiences about business opportunities here and in the [LOC U.S.  ] For example , [ORG FCS  ] and [ORG ECON  ] have facilitated contact between the [MISC American  ] Chamber of [LOC Commerce  ] and local [MISC Turkish  ] and [MISC Moroccan  ] chambers , and is working to schedule a job fair in conjunction with a major [LOC U.S.  ] placement company to assist minority youth seeking employment . 
[ORG FCS  ] has also established strong contacts with a local organization for minority businesswomen . 
SUCCESS STORIES --------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While there has been steady progress over the past six months in improving mission 's outreach and reporting efforts , several cases stand out as clear indicators of success . 
These include: - [LOC Amsterdam  ] West: As reported ref c , intensive outreach to this predominantly [MISC Muslim  ] neighborhood in [LOC Amsterdam  ] -- home to [PER Mohammed Bouyeri  ] , the confessed murderer of [PER Theo van Gogh  ] -- has resulted in a remarkably positive relationship between local community leaders and mission personnel. - Iftar Dinner: The Iftar dinner hosted by Charge ( ref b ) was video-taped and broadcast on a local cable station catering to the [MISC Dutch-Moroccan  ] community in [LOC Amsterdam  ] . 
[MISC Muslim  ] and non-Muslim contacts continue to cite this event as a highlight of the [MISC Ramadan  ] season ; other Embassies ( including from predominantly [MISC Muslim  ] countries ) have subsequently declared their intention to host similar events next year. - [ORG IVP Recipients:  ] Mission has had great success in identifying up-and-coming [MISC Dutch Muslim  ] community figures for [ORG IVP  ] programs . 
A prime example is [PER Hany Abu-Assad  ] , a [MISC Dutch-Palestinian  ] film director whose film , [MISC Paradise Now  ] was just nominated for an [PER Oscar  ] for best foreign language film . 
Prominent nominees this year include: -- [LOC Amsterdam  ] Alderman [PER Ahmad Abutaleb  ] , widely considered the most popular [MISC Muslim  ] politician in the country will be an [ORG IVP  ] participant in summer of 2006 ; -- [PER Nor-Eddine Ghoudani  ] , chief Editor of [LOC Mzine Magazine  ] , was selected for the [PER Edward R. Murrow Program  ] for Journalists for April , 2006 ; -- Two [MISC Muslim  ] women members of parliament -- [PER Fadime Orgu  ] and [PER Khadija Arib  ] -- will participate in IV programs this spring/summer. - Most Popular Muslims: In January , 2006 , a local website ( www.blijvenhier.nl ) published the results of a poll to identify the most popular [MISC Muslims  ] in the country . 
Of the 24 individuals named , Post was proud to note that 14 were current mission contacts -- and we are working on the rest . 
NEXT STEPS: ---------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Post plans to take advantage of the arrival of a new Ambassador in early March to advance our outreach and reporting activities . 
The IIWG is currently scheduling events for [MISC Ambassador-designate  ] and [PER Mrs. Arnall  ] which will bring them in contact with prominent members of the [MISC Dutch Muslim  ] community . 
Post is also working with the [LOC U.S.  ] Navy to use an upcoming ship visit to [LOC Rotterdam  ] to expand contact with the local [MISC Muslim  ] community , hopefully scheduling a community service project with a local school . 
In addition , [ORG FCS  ] and the local [MISC American  ] Chamber of [LOC Commerce  ] are jointly developing a proposal to provide internships and job training with [MISC American  ] companies ( and the [LOC U.S.  ] mission ) for qualified minority/Muslim students . 
Post is also in contact with Embassy [LOC Brussels  ] to explore possibilities for bringing [MISC American  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] [MISC Muslim  ] community leaders together along the lines of the very successful conference held in [LOC Brussels  ] in November 2005 .
