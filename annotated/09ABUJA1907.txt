END SUMMARY. ------------------------- CURRENT STATUS OF THE [ORG PIB  ] ------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG Shell  ] EVP for [ORG Shell Companies in Africa  ] [PER Ann Pickard  ] met with the Ambassador at the [ORG Embassy  ] on October 13 . 
The [ORG DCM  ] and Economic Counselor joined the Ambassador , and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] accompanied [PER Pickard  ] . 
The Ambassador asked [PER Pickard  ] for her views about the status of the [ORG Petroleum Industry  ] Bill ( [ORG PIB  ] ) . 
[PER Pickard  ] said the [ORG GON  ] wanted the [ORG National Assembly  ] to pass the bill by November 17 in order for the [ORG GON  ] to be able to announce it at the upcoming [LOC CWC Gulf  ] of [LOC Guinea  ] Conference in [LOC London  ] November 17-19 . 
She said that if the [ORG House  ] passes the [ORG PIB  ] in the coming weeks , “we need to move quickly” to obtain any necessary changes before it becomes law . 
Fortunately , she added , “We are working with the [ORG House  ] and the [ORG House  ] appears to want to work with us.” She continued that if the [ORG Senate  ] passes the [ORG PIB  ] , “We aren’t worried.” Unfortunately , she explained , “We think the [ORG Senate  ] will pass a bad bill” but it won’t really matter . 
She added that she would be at the [MISC Nigerian  ] [ORG House  ] and [ORG Senate  ] later that day and would let the [ORG Embassy  ] know if there were any unexpected developments. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The Ambassador asked if [ORG Shell  ] had had engagements with the [ORG GON  ] outside the [ORG National Assembly  ] , such as with the [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] and the [ORG Central Bank of Nigeria  ] . 
[PER Pickard  ] said , “We are meeting with them at all levels.” She noted that an [ORG IMF  ] team headed by [PER Charles McPherson  ] was in [LOC Abuja  ] to look at the [ORG PIB  ] and that [ORG Shell  ] would be meeting with them as well . 
In contrast , she said , “We are worried about the [ORG World Bank’s  ] political agenda and it is not clear what their agenda is.” She said the [ORG World Bank  ] was working on how to make the IJVs “bankable” so that they would be able to go to international and domestic banks for financing. ------------------------------ GAS FLARING AND CLIMATE CHANGE ------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Pickard  ] said the [ORG PIB  ] requires an end to gas flaring by 2010 . 
She said the industry won’t be able to do that due to the lack of [PER QShe  ] said the industry won’t be able to do that due to the lack of investment and security . 
[ORG Shell  ] is ahead of the other [ORG IOCs  ] and could be ready by 2011 . 
[ORG Shell  ] would have to spend $4 billion to do this , but the [ORG GON  ] would also have to fund its part and that is a risk . 
[ORG Shell  ] would shut in oil production in fields where it is uneconomic to end gas flaring , and it would let others have the gas for free where it is economic to do so. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Pickard  ] continued that [ORG NNPC General Managing  ] Director Dr. [PER Mohammed Barkindo  ] was interested in doing something on climate change in preparation for the climate change summit in [LOC Copenhagen  ] December 6-18 . 
[PER Barkindo  ] was spread pretty thin so [ORG Shell  ] will ask him how they can help him prepare for the summit . 
She added that [ORG Shell  ] had recently told the oil producing countries that coal will squeeze out oil as a result of the CO2 footprint issue if the oil producing [ORG ABUJA  ] 00001907 002 OF 004 countries and [ORG IOCs  ] do not do more to address the issue. ------------------ POTENTIAL BENEFITS ------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Pickard  ] summarized the PIB’s potential benefits . 
The creation of fully integrated and independently functioning international joint ventures ( IJVs ) would solve the oil and gas industry’s longstanding funding problems if the proposed IJVs are done right . 
The [MISC Nigerian  ] [ORG National Petroleum Company  ] ( [ORG NNPC  ] ) was previously forced to reduce its ownership of some existing joint ventures to 49 percent to make them profitable enough to obtain financing . 
The proposed division of responsibilities between the [ORG NNPC  ] and the [ORG Directorate of Petroleum Resources  ] also would be good . 
The [ORG IOCs  ] currently do not know if the [ORG NNPC  ] is their partner or regulator. ---------------------------- COHESION WITHIN THE INDUSTRY ---------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The Ambassador asked if the industry was united in its approach to the [ORG PIB  ] . 
[PER Pickard  ] replied that there was “total alignment with the international oil companies at every level.” She acknowledged that [ORG Shell  ] had more exposure to the loss of acreage than any other company. “We could lose 80 percent of our acreage , ” she said . 
The problem comes from the fact that the [ORG PIB  ] will redefine how a company can hold on to its exploration and production blocks , limiting what can be kept to two kilometers around each well. “Everyone offshore loses a lot , ” she continued. “We will have to bring satellites on fast or we will lose the blocks.” However , the problem with that is that the companies have to be able to pass things through to the blocks quickly and it takes years to get a rig in due to delays in the [MISC Nigerian  ] approval process . 
( [PER NOTE: Pickard  ] told [ORG Econoff  ] in [LOC Lagos  ] that [ORG Shell  ] “sent away” three platforms in late September . 
END NOTE . 
) ------------------------------------- ALIGNMENT WITH [MISC NIGERIAN  ] OIL COMPANIES ------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The Ambassador asked about the [LOC IOCs’  ] alignment with the [MISC Nigerian  ] oil companies . 
[PER Pickard  ] replied that “the [MISC Nigerian  ] companies are with us” because they will be taxed at the same rate in the current version of the [ORG PIB  ] . 
The [ORG IOCs  ] are starting to see what the [MISC Nigerian  ] companies want to do. -------------- THE USG’S ROLE -------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The Ambassador asked what the [ORG Embassy  ] could do to help with the [ORG Joint House Committee  ] on [ORG Petroleum Upstream  ] and [LOC Downstream  ] and Justice that is working on the [ORG PIB  ] . 
[PER Pickard  ] said she hoped the current level of dialogue between the [ORG GON  ] and the [ORG IOCs  ] continues . 
Unfortunately , “We have not been able to meet with President [PER Yar’Adua  ] for nine months , ” she said. “They have him protected.” She said it would be helpful if the [ORG Embassy  ] would continue to deliver low-level messages of concern . 
In particular , she thought it would be helpful for the [ORG Embassy  ] to call on Speaker of the [ORG House  ] [PER Dimeji Bankoke  ] to see where he stood on the bill . 
Beyond that , she would like to keep the [ORG Embassy  ] in reserve and use it as a “silver bullet” if the [ORG PIB  ] passes the [ORG House  ] . 
The Ambassador noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC U.K.  ] , [MISC Dutch  ] and [LOC Qthe House  ] . 
The Ambassador noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC U.K.  ] , [MISC Dutch  ] and [MISC French  ] Embassies had already made a joint call on [ORG NNPC General Managing  ] Director Dr. [PER Mohammed Barkindo.  ] ---------------------------------------- [ORG CHINA’S  ] INTEREST IN NIGERIA’S OIL BLOCKS ---------------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Pickard  ] mentioned China’s recently reported interest in Nigeria’s oil blocks . 
She said [ORG Shell  ] had received a copy of the letter that [ORG Special Advisor  ] to the President on [ORG Petroleum Matters  ] Dr. [PER Emmanuel Egbogah  ] had sent to the [MISC Chinese  ] which said that their offer for oil exploration blocks was not good enough . 
Minister of [ORG State for Petroleum Resources  ] Odein [PER Ajumogobia  ] had denied that the letter [ORG ABUJA  ] 00001907 003 OF 004 had been sent , but later conceded that the [ORG GON  ] was only “benchmarking” to see what the [ORG IOCs  ] should pay for shallow-water licenses . 
[PER Pickard  ] said [ORG Shell  ] had good sources to show that their data had been sent to both [LOC China  ] and [LOC Russia  ] . 
She said the [ORG GON  ] had forgotten that [ORG Shell  ] had seconded people to all the relevant ministries and that [ORG Shell  ] consequently had access to everything that was being done in those ministries. --------------------------------------------- -- CHANGING RESPONSIBILITIES WITHIN THE [MISC GON’S  ] TEAM --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Pickard  ] observed that there might be changes with how the [ORG GON  ] management of the petroleum sector is organized . 
Minister of [ORG Petroleum Resources  ] [PER Rilwanu Lukman  ] may be given the responsibility for implementing the [ORG PIB  ] , while Minister of [ORG State for Petroleum Resources  ] Ajumogobia may get the [ORG Directorate of Petroleum Resources  ] and ongoing business . 
The problem with these changes is that the [ORG GON  ] could still get “unempowered people” who are not able to address the issues . 
The question is whether [PER Ajumogobia  ] would be able to step up . 
( [ORG NOTE: Press  ] reports on October 17 reported that [PER Lukman  ] will be given overall responsibility for the formulation of policy , and oversee the implementation of the [ORG PIB  ] , the [ORG Integrated Joint Venture  ] negotiation and rollout , the fiscal terms transition and implementation , the new organization implementation , and stakeholder management . 
We will also supervise the [ORG NNPC  ] and its subsidiaries , the [ORG Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  ] , the [ORG African Petroleum Producers Association  ] , and the [ORG University of Petroleum  ] . 
[PER Ajumogobia  ] will be in charge of the [ORG Gas Master Plan Transition Implementation  ] , the [ORG Gas Exporting Countries Forum  ] , the [MISC Nigerian  ] Liquefied [ORG Natural Gas  ] , the alternative fuels , and the [ORG Petroleum Equalization Fund  ] . 
He will also oversee the [ORG Directorate of Petroleum Resources  ] , the [ORG Petroleum Training Institute  ] and the [ORG Pricing Regulatory Agency  ] . 
END NOTE . 
) -------------------------- SHELL’S CURRENT PRODUCTION -------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The Ambassador asked about the level of [ORG Shell’s  ] current operations . 
[PER Pickard  ] said [ORG Shell  ] was producing 663,000 barrels per day as of October 13 , including the [LOC Bonga  ] field . 
Approximately 80,000 barrels per day had been brought back from the [LOC Forcados  ] field on the previous day . 
Some 900,000 barrels per day of capacity was still shut in . 
Of that , [ORG Shell  ] could bring back 600,000 barrels per day , while the remaining 300,000 barrels per day is “too unreachable.” -------------------------- AMNESTY IN THE [LOC NIGER DELTA  ] -------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) The Ambassador asked [PER Pickard  ] what she thought about the future of the GON’s amnesty offer to militants in the [LOC Niger Delta  ] . 
She responded that [ORG Shell  ] expected the situation in the [LOC Niger Delta  ] to be “quiet” until the end of the year . 
It will then get “out-of-hand” when the election cycle starts up in December , January and February . 
She expressed particular concern about [LOC Bayelsa State  ] , home to [ORG Shell’s  ] 500,000 barrel-per-day capacity [LOC Bonny  ] field . 
[PER Pickard  ] also noted that [MISC Q500,000  ] barrel-per-day capacity [LOC Bonny  ] field . 
[PER Pickard  ] also noted that [ORG Shell  ] saw [MISC Israeli  ] security experts in [LOC Bayelsa  ] , but not in the [LOC Delta  ] , and that there had been “a big drop in kidnapping” as a result. ------------- Looking Ahead ------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) XXXXXXXXXXXX ------- COMMENT [ORG ABUJA  ] 00001907 004 OF 004 ------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [ORG Shell’s  ] views of the [ORG PIB  ] and the alignment among the [ORG IOCs  ] and with the [MISC Nigerian  ] oil companies track closely with the views of [ORG ExxonMobil  ] , as reported in reftel . 
The main difference is that [ORG Shell  ] tends to minimize the different tax concerns and financial vulnerabilities of the individual [ORG IOCs  ] . 
[ORG Shell  ] is much more vulnerable than the other [ORG IOCs  ] because its operations are concentrated in less favorable JV concessions that are located in the violence-prone [LOC Niger Delta  ] . 
[ORG ExxonMobil  ] and Chevron’s operations are concentrated in more favorable production sharing contracts ( [ORG PSC  ] ) in the relatively violence-free offshore areas . 
In the event that the [ORG PIB  ] retains negative terms or violence returns to the [LOC Delta  ] , [ORG Shell  ] can be expected to hurt the most and cry the loudest. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 .
