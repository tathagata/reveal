( [ORG U  ] ) Summary . 
The recent announcement of a permanent ceasefire by the [MISC Basque  ] separatist terror group [ORG ETA  ] was met with cautious optimism by a public that recalls [ORG ETA  ] 's abandonment of previous truces . 
However , there is a sense that [ORG ETA  ] 's declining military fortunes and [ORG Zapatero  ] 's readiness to engage [MISC Basque  ] political factions , have convinced [ORG ETA  ] of the need to end violence and shift to the political arena . 
Government figures involved in the negotiations remain tight-lipped about the details of their discussions , but press reports indicate that [PER Sinn Fein  ] figures played a role in convincing [ORG ETA  ] to shift to the political process and that [PER Sinn Fein  ] briefed former President [PER Clinton  ] and [ORG USG  ] officials regarding the progess of the [ORG ETA  ] talks ; a March 30 press report indicated strong interest by former President [PER Clinton  ] in playing a mediating role . 
Some ETA-Government discussions evidently took place in third countries , including in [LOC Norway  ] and [LOC Switzerland  ] . 
The [ORG ETA  ] announcement has proven a major political victory for the [ORG Zapatero  ] government , one that will likely benefit the [ORG Socialist Party  ] through the 2008 general elections . 
End summary. //ETA ON THE WANE// <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG ETA  ] has killed more than 850 people during its four-decade-long battle to win self-determination for the [ORG Basque Region  ] , which already enjoys considerable autonomy , including its own police force , control over tax revenues , and management of its education system . 
The terrorist group benefited from both a strong [MISC Basque  ] sense of cultural identity and from the region 's historical grievances against the [ORG Madrid  ] government . 
However , support for [ORG ETA  ] has been limited by the [MISC Basque  ] region 's heterogenous political environment ( with about one-third of the electorate supporting close ties to the central government ) and by the strength of moderate [MISC Basque  ] nationalist political groups . 
[ORG ETA  ] and its political front groups , known as the " abertzale " or [MISC Basque  ] nationalist left , have maintained a core of approximately 150,000 supporters out of the [ORG Basque Region  ] 's population of 2.1 million , a political base strong enough to play a spoiler , but too small to set the political agenda. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG ETA  ] 's military capacity has been in steady decline since 1990 , a trend that has accelerated in recent years . 
The combination of [LOC Spanish/French  ] police pressure and the exclusion of [ORG ETA  ] front group [ORG Batasuna  ] from the political system ( because of its refusal to renounce terrorism ) had greatly weakened [ORG ETA  ] by 2004 . 
Most police observers believe that fewer than 150 [ORG ETA  ] terrorists remain at large , while more than 500 are being held in [MISC Spanish  ] and [MISC French  ] jails . 
The March 2004 Madrid train attacks added complications for [ORG ETA  ] in the form of increased public intolerance of political violence , even among [MISC Basque  ] radical supporters. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [ORG Socialist  ] ( [ORG PSOE  ] ) victory in 2004 also led to greatly improved relations between the central government and moderate [MISC Basque  ] political parties , further isolating radical [MISC Basque  ] nationalists . 
[ORG Zapatero  ] hinted , however , that the [ORG PSOE  ] would be open to a greater political role for [ORG ETA  ] front groups if the organization abandoned the armed struggle , an important signal in advance of key municipal elections coming up in 2007 . 
Sensing the shift in its political and military environment , [ORG ETA  ] approached the [ORG Zapatero  ] government in August 2004 to suggest exploratory discussions. //MULTIPLE CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION// <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) While the small circle of [ORG Zapatero  ] advisers who manage the [ORG ETA  ] peace process have refused to discuss details , press reports indicate that [ORG Zapatero  ] responded positively to [ORG ETA  ] 's soundings , authorizing a series of contacts that eventually led to the March 22 cease fire announcement . 
It appears that those discussions were undertaken through intermediaries in different locations , including in [LOC Oslo  ] and [LOC Geneva  ] in the summer of 2005 , and that the talks were intended as confidence building measures rather than to formally resolve specific issues. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) At the international level , [PER Sinn Fein  ] figures played an important role in convincing [ORG ETA  ] to announce a cease fire and express support for a political solution to the conflict . 
Specifically , [MISC Parliamentarians  ] [PER Gerry Kelly  ] and [PER Alex Maskey  ] have been identified as [PER Sinn Fein  ] " advisers " to [ORG ETA  ] , a role they allegedly took on at the request of [ORG Batasuna  ] . 
According to the daily " [ORG El Mundo  ] , " [PER Kelly  ] and [PER Maskey  ] briefed [PER Sinn Fein  ] leader [PER Gerry Adams  ] , who then reportedly briefed the [MISC Irish  ] and [LOC UK  ] governments , as well as [ORG U.S. State Department  ] official [PER Mitchell Reiss  ] and former President [PER Clinton  ] , on the progress [ORG MADRID  ] 00000766 002.2 OF 003 of the talks . 
According to [MISC Spanish  ] daily " [ORG El Periodico  ] , " [MISC Spanish  ] government sources report that former President [PER Clinton  ] contacted [ORG Zapatero  ] to offer to act as a mediator in [ORG ETA  ] discussions ; the press report said [ORG Zapatero  ] was very interested in involving a " [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Democrat  ] with international prestige " in the peace talks . 
COMMENT: The [ORG Embassy  ] has not received any such indications from the [MISC Spanish  ] government . 
END COMMENT. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) While these international contacts were important in bringing [ORG ETA  ] along , the key internal communications began with a set of conversations between the [MISC Basque  ] branch of the [ORG Spanish Socialist Party  ] and [ORG Batasuna  ] leader [PER Arnaldo Otegi  ] in early 2004 . 
Through these discussions ( which will be reviewed extensively in a separate cable ) , the [ORG Zapatero  ] government signaled its willingness to negotiate with radical [MISC Basques  ] , but only if [ORG ETA  ] announced a halt to its terrorist activities . 
[ORG Batasuna  ] and [ORG Basque Socialist  ] leaders agreed during these talks that [ORG ETA  ] would leave political issues to be handled by " abertzale " ( [MISC Basque  ] leftist ) political parties , while [ORG ETA  ] would only address issues related to weapons and [ORG ETA  ] prisoners . 
Under these terms , [ORG ETA  ] agreed to a cease fire , at a time to be determined by the organization . 
Almost certainly , [ORG ETA  ] made the announcement now in the hope that [ORG Batasuna  ] would have time to negotiate its participation in the 2007 [MISC Basque  ] municipal elections. //PARSING THE CEASE FIRE// <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [MISC Spanish  ] experts and media pored over the March 22 cease fire announcement to compare it with previous truce delcarations . 
The most critical element in the 2006 [ORG ETA  ] document in comparison with previous delarations is the absence of an explicit demand for [MISC Basque  ] self-determination , [ORG ETA  ] 's central ambition throughout its history . 
The short [ORG ETA  ] statement appears to have been drafted to fit the resolution approved by [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG Congress  ] in May 2005 , which requires [ORG ETA  ] 's abandonment of the armed struggle as a pre-condition for government negotiations with [ORG ETA  ] . 
Skeptics point out that the [ORG ETA  ] statement neither expressed regret for [ORG ETA  ] 's use of terrorist methods nor repudiated tactics such as extortion and " kale borroka , " ( organized vandalism and street violence ) , tactics it continued to employ during previous truces . 
It is vague in that respect and could leave the door open for [ORG ETA  ] to continue to use these methods. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG Zapatero  ] is expected to delay responding to [ORG ETA  ] for at least two months to allow the government to determine whether [ORG ETA  ] is complying with its cease fire . 
In an important clarification , Vice President [PER Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega  ] indicated that the government viewed both the cessation of [ORG ETA  ] street violence and the halt of [ORG ETA  ] extortion of [MISC Basque  ] businesses as part of the cease fire. //A POLITICAL COUP FOR ZAPATERO// <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While there is far to go in achieving a definitive end to the [ORG ETA  ] problem , the cease fire announcement constitutes a resounding political victory for [ORG Zapatero  ] . 
The cease fire not only vindicated [ORG Zapatero  ] 's pursuit of a negotiated solution to the conflict , it also undermined opposition accusations that he was weak on terrorism . 
The result was an immediate jump in [ORG Zapatero  ] 's approval ratings and a surge in confidence within the [ORG Socialist Party  ] , which until the [ORG ETA  ] announcement was barely one point ahead of the [ORG PP  ] in the polls . 
[PER Rafael Estrella  ] , the [ORG Socialist  ] spokesperson in the Parliamentary [ORG Foreign Affairs Commission  ] , told the [ORG DCM  ] and Political Counselor on March 22 that the [ORG ETA  ] announcement virtually guaranteed a political victory for the [ORG Socialist Party  ] in the 2008 general elections . 
Less partisan observers have echoed this analysis. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG Zapatero  ] has moved swiftly to consolidate his advantage . 
After dramatically expressing his " full confidence " in the [ORG PP  ] to work responsibly with his government in managing the [ORG ETA  ] peace process , [ORG Zapatero  ] met with [ORG Popular Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) leader [PER Mariano Rajoy  ] on March 28 to seal the bargain . 
The [ORG PP  ] grudgingly agreed to support the government 's initiative , understanding that it would face a significant backlash if the party were perceived as blocking an opportunity to bring an end to [ORG ETA  ] violence . 
In order to obtain full political cover , [ORG Zapatero  ] will meet with all political parties to seek their support and is expected to eventually ask the Parliament for authorization to start official talks with [MISC ETA.  ] //COMMENT// <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) It may be early for the [ORG PSOE  ] to forecast victory in the 2008 elections , but the [ORG Zapatero  ] government is clearly in a very strong position and well situated to direct events to [ORG MADRID  ] 00000766 003.2 OF 003 [ORG PSOE  ] 's advantage . 
Many observers expect [ORG Zapatero  ] to delay any definitive solution regarding [ORG ETA  ] 's status and [MISC Basque  ] autonomy until after the 2008 elections rather than risking a bruising political fight on these issues before electoral victory is assured . 
[ORG Zapatero  ] could suffer if his handling of [ORG ETA  ] is viewed as insensitive to the victims of terrorism , but his caution and pursuit of broad political backing for his approach to [ORG ETA  ] will shield him to some degree . 
A more controversial point will be the political " reinsertion " of [MISC ETA-affiliated  ] groups , which is necessary in [ORG Zapatero  ] 's view and yet anathema to the [ORG PP  ] and to conservative voters . 
At this point , the most likely approach is the formation of a new [MISC Basque  ] nationalist party rather than the " legalization " of [ORG Batasuna  ] , since [ORG Batasuna  ] remains under judicial sanction and is associated by the public with its defense of [ORG ETA  ] terrorism .
