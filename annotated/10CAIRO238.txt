( [ORG SBU  ] ) Key Points: --Prime Minister [PER Ahmed Nazif  ] told the Ambassador and Science Envoy [PER Ahmed Zewail  ] that the [MISC Egyptian  ] government ( [ORG GoE  ] ) plans to create a center of excellence targeting entrepreneurship and innovation , although he did not provide a detailed timeline for implementation. --The [ORG Supreme Council  ] on Science and Technology will serve as the lead government agency in creating a blueprint for the center. --According to [PER Nazif  ] , the [ORG GoE  ] envisions the center as a joint US-Egypt project and is seeking a " substantial commitment " of financial and technical assistance outside current [MISC USAID  ] programming in [LOC Egypt.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) In a January 26 meeting , the Ambassador and Dr. [PER Zewail  ] met with PM [PER Nazif  ] and four ministers ( [ORG International Cooperation  ] , Finance , Higher Education , and [ORG Local Development  ] ) from the [ORG Supreme Council  ] on Science and Technology ( [ORG SCST  ] ) . 
This was [PER Zewail  ] 's second meeting with [PER Nazif  ] and the [ORG SCST  ] , and followed his public statements to support [LOC Egypt  ] in identifying key national science and technology priorities. ------------------------------------- EGYPT'S PROPOSED CENTER OF EXCELLENCE ------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) After thanking [PER Zewail  ] for his continued focus on assisting [LOC Egypt  ] in building its science and education infrastructure , [PER Nazif  ] launched into a discussion concerning a recently announced [ORG GoE  ] plan to build a center of excellence targeting entrepreneurship and innovation initiatives . 
He said the [ORG Supreme Council for Science and Technology  ] had created a taskforce to develop a " blueprint " for the new center . 
The [ORG Ministry of International Cooperation  ] would serve as the lead agency in these efforts . 
( Note: According to January 14 press accounts , this [MISC Cairo-based  ] center will open in January 2011 and will collaborate with private companies , universities , and government technology organizations . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Nazif  ] stated that he envisioned this center as a joint US-Egypt project . 
The [ORG GoE  ] would provide the land and construction of the center 's buildings , he said , and the [ORG USG  ] would " allocate funds to run the center . 
" He acknowledged that the center 's priorities are not fully sketched out , but would likely include a mandate to support projects concerning agriculture ( defined as food safety ) , health , water security , energy , and information technology . 
More importantly , the center would serve as a focal point to provide financial and technical assistance to " young entrepreneurs starting their own businesses . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Nazif  ] repeatedly referenced the [MISC US-Israel  ] BIRD project as a model for [LOC Egypt  ] 's proposed center . 
He said that BIRD succeeded in building up [LOC Israel  ] 's science and technology base - providing important loans and research opportunities for both countries - and suggested that the center could play a similar role in supporting [LOC Egypt  ] 's efforts to do the same. ------------------------- How to Finance the Center ------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In response to a question from [PER Zewail  ] about how the center will cover science issues , [PER Nazif  ] said he hoped [MISC American  ] and [MISC Egyptian  ] universities would participate but stressed his desire that joint projects would focus on value-related research - specifically leading to job creation in important national areas such as agriculture and renewable energy plans . 
He then pivoted to financing of the center , stating [LOC Egypt  ] was seeking a substantial commitment to ensure the center could carry out its mission . 
" $10 million is not enough , " [PER Nazif  ] stated . 
For the center to succeed in the manner of programs suggested by President [PER Obama  ] in his [LOC Cairo  ] speech in June 2009 , [PER Nazif  ] explained the [LOC US  ] needs to " think on a grand scale . 
" He did not offer a monetary figure but said that for every dollar offered by the [LOC US  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] would match that donation with one [MISC Egyptian  ] pound . 
Speaking for the [ORG SCST  ] , he said that the center would enable [LOC Egypt  ] to develop its technology infrastructure as the [LOC US  ] had done in the 1960s --------------- " Go Beyond [ORG AID  ] " --------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ambassador noted that the [ORG Embassy  ] and [ORG AID  ] are working to direct existing resources to [MISC Egyptian  ] priorities but the PM immediately interrupted by stating that the government must " go beyond [ORG AID  ] programming " and build something that currently does not exist in country . 
The new center is crucial because the " scientific community needs something to build around and aspire to , " [PER Nazif  ] explained . 
It would ultimately serve as a focal point for [LOC Egypt  ] 's science and technology community . 
Noting that [LOC Egypt  ] remains committed to supporting President [PER Obama  ] 's [LOC Cairo  ] initiative , he said that " now is the time for action and the ball is in your court . 
" <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: During his initial envoy visit , [PER Zewail  ] spoke repeatedly about his desire to build stronger collaborative relationships in education , science and technology and move away from building vaguely-defined and poorly staffed research organizations . 
The [ORG GoE  ] , however , is clearly seeking to capitalize on a renewed [LOC US  ] emphasis on science and technology issues by requesting funding for a new center of excellence . 
It is doubtful that a new physical center would advance any of the collaborative projects - in health , science , education - the [LOC US  ] is already partnering with [LOC Egypt  ] .
