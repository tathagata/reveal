The Ambassador raised similar points with van der [ORG Veer  ] on January 19 , immediately following press announcements about the planned investment project . 
The Ambassador noted concerns in [LOC Congress  ] about investment activities in [LOC Iran  ] , including Congressman [PER Tom Lantos'  ] recent statement during hearings on Next Steps in the [LOC Iran  ] Crisis . 
He said the [ORG USG  ] valued the close and frank communication that existed between [ORG Shell  ] and [LOC Washington  ] agencies on this issue . 
He said the [ORG USG  ] had also noted van der [ORG Veer  ] 's February 1 public comments to [ORG Reuters  ] on political concerns related to the project ( ref B ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Van der [PER Veer  ] said his public comments had not been well received in [LOC Teheran  ] . 
He confirmed that no final decision was expected on the [MISC South Pars  ] LNG project until <a id='par2008' href='#par2008'>¶</a>2008 . 
Moreover , he fully expected the [MISC Iranians  ] to initiate last-minute changes in the final terms of the agreement , which would result in further delaying any final decision. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Van der [ORG Veer  ] said [ORG Shell  ] understood [ORG USG  ] concerns , adding that [ORG Shell  ] 's primary motive in the [MISC South Pars  ] project was a need to keep [LOC China  ] out . 
The Ambassador countered that [ORG Shell  ] 's more sophisticated and advanced technology was clearly more attractive to [LOC Iran  ] . 
Van der [ORG Veer  ] assured the Ambassador that [ORG Shell  ] would continue to follow a go-slow approach with the project and keep the [ORG USG  ] briefed on any new developments . 
[ORG GONL  ] NON-COMMITTAL ON PUBLIC COMMENT ------------------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) On February 5 , [PER EconCouns  ] discussed ref A points with [PER Koen van der Wolk  ] , Head of the [ORG Emerging Markets Division  ] , [ORG Directorate General for Foreign Economic Relations  ] , [ORG Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs  ] ( [ORG MEA  ] ) . 
She held a separate meeting the same day with [ORG Foreign Affairs Ministry  ] ( [ORG MFA  ] ) officials [PER Gert Heijkoop  ] , Deputy Director of the [LOC Middle East Division  ] in the [LOC Middle East Department  ] , [ORG Loek  ] ten [LOC Hagen  ] , [ORG Senior Policy Officer  ] for [ORG Gulf State Affairs  ] , and [PER Femke Hoogeveen  ] , [ORG Senior Policy Advisor  ] in the [LOC Energy  ] , [ORG Economic  ] and [ORG Environmental Affairs Department  ] .

( C ) Both [ORG MEA  ] and [ORG MFA  ] officials confirmed that [ORG Shell  ] briefed them on a regular basis about the [MISC South Pars  ] project . 
[PER Heijkoop  ] reiterated [ORG GONL  ] support for the implementation of [ORG UNSCR  ] 1737 , including targeted sanctions against the assets and travel of individuals associated with [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program . 
However , both [ORG MEA  ] and [ORG MFA  ] officials said the [ORG GONL  ] THE HAGUE 00000246 002 OF 002 was not prepared to take any steps at this juncture that would limit [ORG Shell  ] activities in the region. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Heijkoop  ] noted that the [ORG GONL  ] shared [ORG USG  ] concerns and said he would consult further about the possibility of a [ORG GONL  ] public comment or signal about concerns of moving forward with major new investment projects in [LOC Iran  ] . 
Van der [PER Wolk  ] questioned whether a [ORG GONL  ] public comment would be constructive at this point , stressing that [ORG Shell  ] was clearly taking a go-slow approach on this and related projects such as in [LOC Yadavaran  ] ( see ref C ) . 
He also asked for further information on possible legislation that would encourage pension funds to divest any shares held in companies that invest in [LOC Iran  ] 's energy sector . 
COMMENT: IT'S A BALANCING ACT ------------------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Van der [PER Veer  ] 's willingness to acknowledge publicly concerns over the [MISC South Pars  ] project strongly suggests that the company realizes the need to balance its long-term commercial interests against continuing good relations with the [ORG USG  ] . 
The [ORG GONL  ] , meanwhile , appears reluctant to weigh in publicly at this point but remains fully engaged in the issue . 
Post will continue to consult with [ORG Shell  ] and [ORG GONL  ] contacts on this issue . 
ACTION REQUESTED: ----------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) In response to the [ORG MEA  ] request ( para 8 ) , Post would appreciate any additional information that [LOC Washington  ] can provide on possible legislation mentioned in ref A that would encourage pension funds to divest in shares held in companies that invest in [LOC Iran  ] 's energy sector .
