END SUMMARY. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) On December 5 the Ambassador met with President [PER Aliyev  ] and discussed both energy and press freedom issues ( septel ) . 
Energyoff was notetaker . 
[MISC Russian  ] PM [PER Fradkov  ] Visit Readout -------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Concerning the just concluded visit to [LOC Baku  ] of [MISC Russian  ] Prime Minister [PER Mikhail Fradkov  ] , [PER Aliyev  ] said that “nothing had changed” concerning the [ORG Gazprom  ] offer of gas to [LOC Azerbaijan  ] at 1.5 billion cubic meters ( bcm ) at [ORG USD  ] 230 per thousand cubic meters ( mcm ) . 
[PER Aliyev  ] said that [LOC Russia  ] knows [LOC Azerbaijan  ] will not buy at this price , which would be more expensive than [MISC Azerbaijan’s  ] burning mazut in its power plants . 
[PER Aliyev  ] said that he did not even seek to raise the issue with [PER Fradkov  ] , but that [PER Fradkov  ] had broached it . 
[PER Aliyev  ] said that [PER Fradkov  ] contended that the [ORG Gazprom  ] offer was not “anti-Azerbaijan , ” and was purely a commercial decision , but [PER Aliyev  ] added that Gazprom’s sales of gas to [LOC Ukraine  ] at [ORG USD  ] 130 per mcm belies this claim . 
[PER Aliyev  ] said that [LOC Russia  ] justifies its lower gas sales price to [LOC Armenia  ] by its being Armenia’s close ally and by purchase of the [MISC Iran-Armenia  ] gas pipeline , by which , he said , [LOC Russia  ] seeks to control strategic future gas export routes to [LOC Europe  ] . 
[LOC Russia  ] was trying to “circle the [MISC European  ] gas market , ” which also was influencing its negotiations with [LOC Belarus  ] , but here too there has not been an agreement on sales price. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Aliyev  ] said that [PER Fradkov  ] also proposed that [LOC Russia  ] could help [LOC Azerbaijan  ] in transporting its gas to third countries , although [PER Aliyev  ] told the Ambassador his response was that he did not see how such ‘help’ would be possible . 
[PER Fradkov  ] told [PER Aliyev  ] that [LOC Russia  ] was going to need more gas for domestic use , which would reduce volumes it could sell to [LOC Europe  ] . 
[PER Aliyev  ] said that [LOC Russia  ] was working with [LOC Algeria  ] to form a gas monopoly . 
Gas Trilat ------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The Ambassador said she knew that [PER Aliyev  ] had had a good discussion with DAS Bryza on energy issues in [LOC Minsk  ] and with [MISC Georgian  ] PM [PER Noghaideli  ] when he visited [LOC Baku  ] on November 30 , and that based on the latter meeting there was going to be a trilateral meeting of the [MISC Turkish  ] , [MISC Georgian  ] and [MISC Azerbaijani  ] Energy Ministers in [LOC Tbilisi  ] on December 8 . 
[PER Aliyev  ] said [MISC Georgian  ] and [LOC Azerbaijan  ] shared a common strategic vision on energy issues , would be coordinating closely in this regard , and as such , during Noghaideli’s December 4-14 visit to the [LOC United States  ] he would be delivering an [MISC Azerbaijani  ] message as well as a [MISC Georgian  ] one ( [ORG Comment:  ] The [MISC Georgian  ] Ambassador told the Ambassador on December 5 that in his [LOC US  ] visit [MISC Georgian  ] PM [PER Noghaideli  ] would ask Secretary [PER Rice  ] and [PER Vice-President Cheney  ] to “encourage” [ORG BP  ] to help this winter ) . 
[PER Aliyev  ] said that he had expected the [MISC Turkish  ] and [MISC Georgian  ] governments to have had positive discussions prior to Noghaideli’s November 30 visit to [LOC Baku  ] but that this did not happen , and that the answer [LOC Georgia  ] received from [LOC Turkey  ] at that time concerning redistribution of [ORG Shah Deniz  ] gas was negative , and contrary to the common understanding arrived at in July 2006 among the leaders of the three countries . 
[LOC BAKU  ] 00001771 002 OF 003 [PER Aliyev  ] said he felt that “the [MISC Turkish  ] approach was not sincere , ” and as such [LOC Azerbaijan  ] and [LOC Georgia  ] needed to coordinate tactics and strategy . 
At a recent high-level meeting of his government [PER Aliyev  ] said he stressed his commitment to the longer-term strategic project of delivering [ORG Caspian  ] gas to [LOC Europe  ] and that “Azerbaijan should not sacrifice its long-term energy strategy for day-to-day needs.” [MISC Azerbaijan’s  ] strategic goal , which [PER Aliyev  ] said was currently more important for [LOC Europe  ] than it was for [LOC Azerbaijan  ] , was to enter [MISC European  ] markets . 
[PER Putin  ] is saying that [LOC Azerbaijan  ] and [LOC Kazakhstan  ] cannot supply gas to [LOC Europe  ] - “if we don’t do it , we lose the battle.” As such , [LOC Azerbaijan  ] has put forward the best possible solution for the short-term gas crunch: some gas for [LOC Georgia  ] , some for [LOC Turkey  ] , some for [LOC Azerbaijan  ] , and some for [LOC Greece.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The Ambassador said that the [MISC Georgians  ] have been led to believe that the [MISC Turkish  ] government is going to be more positive in the December 8 [LOC Tbilisi  ] meeting , although she could not confirm this assessment ( [ORG Comment:  ] the [MISC Georgian  ] Ambassador told the Ambassador on December 5 that [PER Georgia’s Embassy  ] in [LOC Ankara  ] has reported that the [MISC Turkish  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] is saying that [LOC Turkey  ] is now ready to discuss redistributing its 2007 [ORG Shah Deniz  ] gas volumes ) . 
She said that DAS Bryza has suggested that after the December 8 trilateral , it might be useful to have another trilateral meeting on December 14 in [LOC Baku  ] with the inclusion of [ORG BP  ] and [ORG Statoil  ] , and she asked the President for his opinion . 
[PER Aliyev  ] said that “we don’t have time to wait , ” noting that the winter holidays were fast approaching . 
He said he approved the proposed December 14 meeting -- trilateral plus [ORG BP  ] and [ORG Statoil  ] -- and would be willing for [LOC Baku  ] to host it . 
He added that he had wanted [LOC Baku  ] to host the December 8 meeting , but deferred to the [MISC Georgian  ] desire to have it in [LOC Tbilisi  ] . 
He said [ORG USG  ] involvement in the December 14 meeting would be useful . 
He said that the December 8 [LOC Tbilisi  ] meeting would be very important as it would ‘clarify’ the [MISC Turkish  ] position , i.e. whether they were willing to help , and that the December 14 meeting would be similarly important as it would clarify whether [ORG BP  ] was willing to help . 
BP’s Dangerous Game ---------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Aliyev  ] said that [ORG BP  ] could deliver more associated gas from the [MISC ACG  ] field to [LOC Azerbaijan  ] for domestic use , but that it was linking its cooperation in this regard with its desire to extend its Production Sharing Agreement ( [ORG PSA  ] ) with [LOC Azerbaijan  ] to develop [MISC ACG  ] deep gas . 
[PER Aliyev  ] said it was inappropriate for [ORG BP  ] to link all of its issues such as [ORG PSA  ] extension , [MISC ACG  ] deep gas , transportation tariff agreements and others into one bundle ; it also was inappropriate for [ORG BP  ] to link the solution of those issues to [MISC Azerbaijan’s  ] “temporary troubles.” He said that [ORG BP  ] was using “mild blackmail” and argued that [ORG BP  ] must instead act in good faith . 
[PER Aliyev  ] said that he had instructed his officials to tell [ORG BP  ] that if it were not “supportive” with [MISC ACG  ] associated gas , it would not get its way with [ORG PSA  ] extension and [MISC ACG  ] deep gas. “If [ORG BP  ] won’t give us more [MISC ACG  ] associated gas , I have instructed our officials to tell them no [ORG PSA  ] extensions or [MISC ACG  ] deep gas , ” [PER Aliyev  ] underscored . 
He said that he did not want this to happen , since from an economic viewpoint both the [ORG AIOC Consortium  ] and [LOC Azerbaijan  ] would benefit from extending the [ORG PSA  ] and for the [ORG Consortium  ] being the ones to develop [MISC ACG  ] deep gas . 
But it was not just [LOC Azerbaijan  ] , but also [LOC Europe  ] and [LOC Georgia  ] who had a stake in this issue . 
[PER Aliyev  ] concluded by saying that if [LOC Turkey  ] agreed to redistribute its 2007 [ORG Shah Deniz  ] gas that “would almost be the way out , ” but that then [LOC Azerbaijan  ] would still need [ORG BP  ] support in both redistributing this [ORG Shah Deniz  ] gas and also in giving [LOC Azerbaijan  ] more [MISC ACG  ] associated gas. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The President also mused that “we could cut the gas supply to [LOC Turkey”  ] if need be . 
The Ambassador pointed out that this would be an extreme measure with serious repercussions . 
She asked [PER Aliyev  ] if he knew the reasons for [MISC Turkish  ] truculence concerning gas redistribution . 
He said he did not , but suspected it could be monetary , i.e. buying gas at [ORG USD  ] 120 per mcm and selling it at [ORG USD  ] 230 . 
He also [LOC BAKU  ] 00001771 003 OF 003 conjectured that [LOC Turkey  ] could be under serious pressure from [LOC Russia.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
ACTION REQUEST: Ambassador will meet with [ORG BP Azerbaijan  ] President [PER Bill Schrader  ] December 8 . 
Department’s guidance , particularly information on the message being delivered to [ORG BP  ] officials in [LOC Washington  ] , is requested .
