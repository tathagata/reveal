[PER Thomas F. Stephenson  ] , reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Madam Secretary: Your visit is scheduled to coincide with two important [MISC Portuguese  ] foreign policy moments ) recognition of [LOC Kosovo  ] and [LOC Portugal  ] leading discussion on the [ORG EU  ] 's trans-Atlantic policy . 
This is an opportune moment to stress that the [LOC US  ] and [ORG EU  ] generally share goals and to call for an even closer working relationship going forward . 
[LOC Portugal  ] - Steadfast Ally ------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Portugal  ] , a founding member of [ORG NATO  ] , is a steadfast ally who has consistently stood by our side over the years despite various changes in government . 
The President and Prime Minister -- from opposing political parties -- each regularly stress that trans-Atlantic relations are a pillar of [MISC Portuguese  ] foreign policy and that [ORG NATO  ] is the primary guarantor of [MISC European  ] security . 
[LOC Portugal  ] is also a member of the [ORG Proliferation Security Initiative  ] , the [ORG Container Security Initiative  ] , and the [ORG Global Initiative  ] to [ORG Combat Nuclear Terrorism.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Portuguese  ] military is engaged internationally on numerous fronts . 
[LOC Portugal  ] supports [ORG NATO  ] efforts in [LOC Iraq  ] ( 6 soldiers ) , [LOC Kosovo  ] ( 295 ) , and [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( 15 in place and 42 new this week ) , as well as [ORG UN  ] missions in [LOC Lebanon  ] ( 146 ) , [LOC Kosovo  ] ( 2 ) , and [LOC East Timor  ] ( 164 ) . 
[LOC Portugal  ] participates in [LOC EUFOR  ] missions in [LOC Bosnia  ] ( 14 ) , and the [LOC DR Congo  ] ( 2 ) and sends 85 people to support bilateral cooperation in five [MISC Lusophone African  ] nations. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Portuguese  ] government provides liberal access to [MISC Portuguese  ] air and seaports for [LOC U.S.  ] military operations in support of [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Over the past year , more than 2,100 [LOC U.S.  ] military aircraft have overflown [MISC Portuguese  ] controlled airspace and 1,560 have transited through [ORG Lajes Air Base  ] , the joint [MISC USAF-Portuguese  ] base in the [LOC Azores  ] . 
Suggested Areas of Focus ------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [MISC Kosovo:  ] The [MISC Portuguese  ] supported the [PER Ahtisaari Plan  ] and encouraged [ORG EU  ] member states to prepare for the move , but then unexpectedly postponed their own recognition of [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
FM [PER Luis Amado  ] recently confided that the main reason behind the delay was [LOC Portugal  ] 's interest in maintaining a good relationship with [LOC Serbia  ] , which became stronger during [LOC Portugal  ] 's [ORG EU  ] presidency . 
[PER Amado  ] has indicated that [LOC Portugal  ] is ready to recognize [LOC Kosovo  ] during September before UNGA. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [MISC Georgia/Russia: As  ] always with [LOC Russia  ] , the [MISC GOP  ] is reluctant to be critical in public and prefers to work within the [ORG EU  ] or [ORG NATO  ] . 
There was some speculation in the media that President [PER Cavaco Silva  ] was unhappy with the [ORG MFA  ] 's tepid stance on the [MISC Russia-Georgia  ] conflict , but he is not saying so for the record . 
[LOC Portugal  ] is likely to quietly follow , not lead , [ORG EU  ] consensus . 
In its capacity as Chair of the [ORG Community of Democracies  ] , [LOC Portugal  ] has drafted a statement calling for both parties to abide by the cease-fire , along the lines of the [ORG EU  ] statement released on August 13. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) AFRICOM: [LOC Portugal  ] is interested in hosting an [ORG AFRICOM  ] headquarters and has asked to be included in the DoD 's candidate nation list , based on its historic ties to [LOC Africa  ] , its low cost relative to other [MISC European  ] nations , and its proximity . 
It is also the only candidate nation with a foreign-owned base up for consideration , causing concerns that a public leak could lead to misunderstandings , both in the [LOC U.S.  ] and in [LOC Europe  ] . 
The [ORG USG  ] will send a representative in early September to [LOC Portugal  ] to assess discreetly its viability to host [ORG AFRICOM  ] or one of its components. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG US-EU Trans-Atlantic Relationship:  ] FM [PER Amado  ] will lead the Gymnich discussion on September 5 and 6 on how to improve [ORG US-EU  ] ties during the next [LOC U.S.  ] administration , as well as enhance the [ORG US-EU  ] dialogue on third country initiatives. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Afghanistan: In August , [LOC Portugal  ] rotated 163 Special Forces out of [LOC Afghanistan  ] , leaving a 15-person [ORG OMLT  ] and a 42-person [MISC C-130  ] detachment in theatre . 
The [MISC Portuguese  ] have promised to deploy a second 30-person [ORG OMLT  ] later this year . 
Days after the withdrawal , [PER Amado  ] privately stressed to the Ambassador his personal opposition to the move and claimed that President [PER Cavaco Silva  ] had been the main proponent for drawing down the troops . 
He added that he was in favor of [LOC LISBON  ] 00002300 002 OF 003 rotating Special Forces back into theatre soon , which [PER Cavaco Silva  ] has left open as a future possibility. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C/NF ) Enhanced Bilateral Relationships on Energy: Over the last several months , the [MISC GOP  ] has made an effort to strengthen its bilateral commercial relationship with energy-producing nations [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Libya  ] . 
At the same time , [LOC Portugal  ] 's major energy company , [ORG Galp  ] , has made commercial overtures to secure energy contracts in [LOC Iran  ] . 
In response to the latter , we successfully pressed the [ORG MFA  ] and [ORG Galp  ] executives to back away from dealings with [LOC Iran  ] and reiterated the need for a unified international front on sanctions . 
Nevertheless , the [MISC GOP  ] is moving forward with energy partnerships elsewhere , and signed 39 new development and food-for-oil agreements with [LOC Venezuela  ] , as well as an infrastructure for energy MOU with [LOC Libya  ] . 
[LOC Portugal  ] 's relationship with [LOC Venezuela  ] has historically centered around the roughly 500,000 [MISC Portuguese  ] nationals resident in [LOC Venezuela  ] ; this energy agenda is new . 
[LOC Portugal  ] does not have an established relationship with [LOC Libya  ] and is attempting to catch up with other international investors. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Lajes Wage [MISC Increase:  ] The bilateral [ORG Cooperation and Defense Agreement  ] with [LOC Portugal  ] requires that the [ORG U.S. Air Force  ] conduct an annual civilian wage survey to set the salary increase rates for the [MISC Portuguese  ] employees . 
Over the past three years , the [MISC Portuguese  ] have disputed the wage increase offered , stating that the wage survey called for more . 
Rep. [PER Barney Frank  ] proposed legislation that would remove the requirement for the wage survey by substituting language in the bilateral agreement , thereby resolving the issue in future years . 
In exchange for the new language , the [MISC Portuguese  ] employees would be given a one-time settlement to cover the difference between the wage survey rate and the actual increase distributed in 2006 and 2007 . 
The bill is in the [ORG Defense Appropriations Committee  ] , and we do not expect further action until the fall . 
This would appear to be a minor issue , yet if often comes up in discussions at the highest levels . 
Foreign Minister [PER Amado  ] ---------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) You last met with [PER Amado  ] at the August 19 special session at [ORG NATO  ] . 
He has been a great friend of the [LOC US  ] , both in his previous capacity as Minister of [ORG Defense  ] and now as Foreign Minister . 
He is even-tempered , thoughtful , and low-key , and regularly seeks opportunities to coordinate policy with the [LOC US  ] . 
He places great importance on presenting a united public front , whether within the [ORG EU  ] , [ORG NATO  ] or with the [LOC US  ] . 
If there are differences , he prefers to discuss them discreetly . 
Prime Minister [PER Socrates  ] ----------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Socrates  ] is a telegenic and charismatic leader , who worked hard to improve his [MISC English  ] in advance of the [ORG EU  ] presidency . 
He relies on advice from a small circle of advisors . 
He is a very moderate Socialist who has been successful at co-opting or marginalizing the leftists in his party . 
He also aggressively pursued his domestic agenda before assuming the [ORG EU  ] presidency , achieving difficult labor and social security reforms and reducing [LOC Portugal  ] 's budget deficit to near EU-mandated levels . 
[PER Socrates  ] visited President [PER Bush  ] last September to discuss [ORG EU  ] presidency and bilateral issues . 
He has recently been under pressure in the national press for strengthening ties to [LOC Angola  ] , [LOC Libya  ] , and [LOC Venezuela  ] in order to bolster [LOC Portugal  ] 's energy sources and export markets . 
President [PER Cavaco Silva  ] ---------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Cavaco Silva  ] is the most popular politician in [LOC Portugal  ] , even though his center-right party badly trails [ORG Socrates' Socialist Party  ] in polls . 
Although the [MISC Portuguese  ] presidency does not wield the executive power of the [LOC US  ] presidency , the position is not ceremonial . 
[PER Cavaco Silva  ] is commander in chief of the armed forces and must approve military deployments and he chairs the [ORG Council of State  ] , which handles all constitutional issues . 
[PER Cavaco Silva  ] considers former President [PER George H.W. Bush  ] a personal friend . 
[PER Cavaco Silva  ] was displeased that he did not get an [ORG Oval Office  ] meeting with President [PER George W. Bush  ] during his 2007 visit to [LOC Washington  ] to open a Smithsonian exhibition of [MISC Portuguese  ] art , and he declined the former President [PER Bush  ] 's offer to visit [LOC Kennebunkport  ] . 
[MISC Portuguese  ] Embassy officials [LOC LISBON  ] 00002300 003 OF 003 and some of our interlocutors here have suggested that [LOC Portugal  ] 's delay in recognizing [LOC Kosovo  ] and decision to remove troops from [LOC Afghanistan  ] was tied to [PER Cavaco Silva  ] 's pique over the perceived slight .
