[ORG Embassy Beijing  ] , please see paragraph 3. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Background/Objective: The [LOC United States  ] has information that in December 2009 , an [MISC Iranian  ] company was seeking to procure five tons of carbon fiber from [ORG Yoon Networks Shanghai Company  ] . 
We understand this company is likely seeking this material on behalf of the [ORG Shahid Bakeri Industries Group  ] ( [ORG SBIG  ] ) , which is responsible for [LOC Iran  ] 's solid propellant ballistic missile program and an entity designated under [ORG United Nations Security Council Resolution  ] ( [ORG UNSCR  ] ) 1737 . 
The fiber being sought by the [MISC Iranian  ] company may be controlled by the [ORG Wassenaar Arrangement and Nuclear Suppliers Group  ] and could be used to produce rocket nozzles or motor cases for [LOC Iran  ] 's solid propellant ballistic missile systems . 
We want to share this information with [MISC Chinese  ] officials and request that they take measures to prevent this material from being transferred from [LOC China  ] to [LOC Iran  ] 's missile program . 
We also want to note that we believe taking such action would be consistent with [ORG UNSCR  ] 1737. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Action Request: Request [ORG Embassy Beijing  ] approach appropriate host government officials to deliver talking points/non-paper in paragraph 4 below and report response .

It also could be used by [ORG SBIG  ] to produce lighter motor cases that could potentially extend the range of these systems. --We believe that the transfer of this material to [ORG SBIG  ] poses a significant missile proliferation risk and is inconsistent with [ORG UNSCR  ] 1737. --We therefore urge you to investigate this activity and take measures to prevent this material from being transferred from [LOC China  ] to [LOC Iran  ] 's missile program. --We look forward to continued cooperation on missile nonproliferation issues and to hearing of any actions your government takes in response to this information .
