[ORG Itamaraty  ] officials agreed that [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Brazilian  ] troops in [LOC Haiti  ] had formed a strong partnership in their efforts on the ground and are eager to increase the dialog between [LOC Brasilia  ] and [LOC Washington  ] to map out the next steps of assistance to [LOC Haiti  ] . 
End summary. ---------------------------- [MISC BRAZILIAN  ] ASSISTANCE TO [LOC HAITI  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) PolCouns and PolOff met February 8 with [MISC Brazilian  ] Ministry of [ORG External Relations'  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] , also called [ORG Itamaraty  ] ) head of the [ORG Department of Central America  ] and the [LOC Caribbean Minister  ] [PER Rubens Gama  ] , head of [ORG Inter-American Division  ] Carlos [PER Luis Coutinho Perez  ] , and officials from the [ORG Department of North American Affairs  ] and the [ORG Market Access Division  ] to discuss [MISC Brazilian  ] assistance to [LOC Haiti  ] . 
[PER Gama  ] explained that the crisis cabinet created by President [PER Lula  ] following the earthquake in [LOC Haiti  ] , under the direction of [ORG Institutional Security Office  ] ( [ORG GSI  ] ) Minister General [PER Jorge Felix  ] , continues to coordinate the efforts of all federal agencies involved in providing relief assistance to [LOC Haiti  ] . 
[PER Gama  ] highlighted the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Air Force  ] 's three daily humanitarian flights into [LOC Haiti  ] that have allowed [LOC Brazil  ] to donate approximately 500 tons of goods , via 70 flights . 
The donations included 130 tons of medication , and over 1,000 [MISC Haitians  ] have been brought to [LOC Brazil  ] for assistance ( Ref A , B ) . 
3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Brazilian  ] military set up a temporary hospital in [LOC Haiti  ] that has attended to 3,900 emergency cases , including surgeries . 
[PER Gama  ] explained that the [MISC Brazilian  ] military has plans to keep the hospital running for another two months . 
[PER Gama  ] confirmed that the 900 troops promised by [LOC Brazil  ] would start to make their way to [LOC Haiti  ] on February 10 ; he estimated it would take about 10 days for all of the soldiers to reach [LOC Haiti  ] . 
All of the [MISC Brazilian  ] soldiers have previously served in [LOC Haiti  ] and therefore know the lay of the land . 
[PER Gama  ] said [LOC Brazil  ] still hopes to send another additional 400 soldiers to [LOC Haiti  ] . 
However , one of the main obstacles is providing the infrastructure all these soldiers will need in [LOC Haiti  ] , including shelter , food , and water ( Ref . 
B , C ) . ---------------------------- LOOKING TO TRANSITION FROM RELIEF TO RECONSTRUCTION ---------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Gama  ] said that the [MISC Brazilian  ] government is now thinking about its future efforts in [LOC Haiti  ] , which will be focused on reconstruction . 
According to [PER Gama  ] , the emergency phase of assistance has now passed and the biggest problem is reconstructing [LOC Haiti  ] when it lacks any semblance of the infrastructure needed to execute such efforts . 
[PER Gama  ] noted that [LOC Brazil  ] needs to purchase land for hospitals and buildings and negotiate contracts with the government and private firms , none of which can be done with the current lack of infrastructure in [LOC Haiti  ] . 
[PER Gama  ] also noted that slots for flights into [LOC Haiti  ] are still very difficult to obtain and that [LOC Brazil  ] needs more than the three flight slots it currently has , especially when flying in government officials who need to evaluate [LOC Brazil  ] 's efforts in [LOC Haiti  ] . 
( [ORG DAO  ] comment: [LOC Brazil  ] has cancelled more slots than any other [LOC Haiti  ] airport user . 
[ORG DAO  ] assesses that , even if [LOC Brazil  ] had more slots per day , it would only have the resources to use only three to four slots per day in a best case scenario . 
When [LOC Brazil  ] flies government officials into [LOC Haiti  ] , it does so on passenger planes that do not carry with them humanitarian assistance . 
End [ORG DAO  ] comment . 
) [PER Gama  ] said that , for now , the [MISC Brazilian  ] government is operating with the knowledge and infrastructure of the [MISC Brazilian  ] soldiers in the [ORG UN Stabilization Mission  ] in [LOC Haiti  ] ( [ORG MINUSTAH  ] ) because they had food and assistance distribution methods set up even before the earthquake . 
[PER Gama  ] stressed that in moving from the relief to the reconstruction phase , the [MISC Haitian  ] government needs to provide the international community with its priorities . 
Following the meeting , [PER Gama  ] confirmed to PolOff that March 31 is [LOC Brazil  ] 's preferred date for the [LOC Haiti  ] donors conference , not only because of conflicts in April , but also because they " think this conference should be held as soon as possible . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Gama  ] confirmed that [MISC Brazilian  ] President [PER Lula  ] will be traveling to [LOC Haiti  ] on February 25 , staying only five hours . 
[PER Gama  ] speculated that during the short visit [PER Lula  ] will fly in one of the [MISC Brazilian  ] helicopters being used for humanitarian assistance in [LOC Haiti  ] , visit with [MISC Brazilian  ] troops , and have lunch with the [MISC Haitian  ] government . 
[PER Gama  ] noted that [PER Lula  ] already had a trip to the [LOC Caribbean  ] planned and that he added [LOC Haiti  ] to the plans following the earthquake. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Gama  ] also clarified what has been labeled in the [MISC Brazilian  ] press as the [PER Lula  ] government 's " [ORG Bolsa Haiti  ] . 
" [LOC Brasilia  ] has brainstormed and proposed a number of projects to assist [LOC Haiti  ] in its reconstruction efforts and the press lumped all of these together and labeled it " [ORG Bolsa Haiti  ] " and even " [PER Plano Lula  ] , " which he explained was not the government 's doing . 
( [PER Comment: It  ] was actually [PER FM Amorim  ] who , in a press conference , suggested that [LOC Haiti  ] need a " [PER Lula Plan  ] , " rather than a " [PER Marshall Plan  ] . 
" End comment . 
) The main concerns driving these proposals are unemployment , lack of security , and infrastructure left by the earthquake . 
Providing aid does not help [LOC Haiti  ] get back on its feet , [PER Gama  ] explained , and [LOC Brazil  ] is looking for ways to create work and restart the economy in [LOC Haiti  ] . 
According to [PER Gama  ] , those who left Haiti-including the [MISC Haitians  ] and [ORG U.N.  ] officials-need to return to rebuild the country . 
[PER Gama  ] said that [LOC Brazil  ] still plans to reduce trade barriers with [LOC Haiti  ] to help facilitate the creation of a [MISC Haitian  ] economy. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Perez  ] said [LOC Brazil  ] believes that the [ORG Organization of American States  ] ( [ORG OAS  ] ) mission in [LOC Haiti  ] of institutional capacity building is even more important now following the earthquake . 
He believed that the [ORG OAS  ] will have a greater role in [LOC Haiti  ] when the focus turns to long-term planning for the country . 
[PER Perez  ] admitted that the [ORG OAS  ] often suffers from a " deficit of results , " which is a problem , and leaves the role of the [ORG OAS  ] in [LOC Haiti  ] 's future to still be shaped. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Regarding the next day 's meeting of the [ORG Union of South American Nations  ] ( [ORG UNASUL  ] ) to discuss regional assistance to [LOC Haiti  ] , [PER Gama  ] joked that , " we just hope the meeting is not too unruly . 
" He warned that rhetoric is often spouted and inflamed during these meetings but also assured [MISC PolOffs  ] that [ORG UNASUL  ] has an important role to mobilize political will and public opinion in support of the region 's efforts and to maintain the commitment to providing assistance to [LOC Haiti  ] . 
[PER Gama  ] said that [PER Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] had been selected to represent [LOC Brazil  ] at the meeting because it was called at the last minute and both [MISC Brazilian  ] President [PER Lula  ] and Foreign Minister [PER Amorim  ] had previously scheduled engagements. ---------------------------- [LOC BRAZIL  ] UNCLEAR ABOUT MINUSTAH'S FUTURE ROLE ---------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Gama  ] brought up the future role and composition of [ORG MINUSTAH  ] as an important issue to be discussed between [LOC Brazil  ] , the [LOC United States  ] , and the [ORG UN  ] . 
PolCouns noted that Itamaraty Secretary General [PER Antonio Patriota  ] had told the [LOC Ambasador  ] just a few days before that [LOC Brazil  ] agreed [ORG MINUSTAH  ] 's mandate should be kept as it is for now until future needs are clear . 
[PER Gama  ] said that the [MISC Brazilian  ] government is not even sure what it sees as the future of [ORG MINUSTAH  ] , but emphasized that the security situation in [LOC Haiti  ] must be tackled. ---------------------------- POSITIVE BRAZIL-U.S . 
PARTNERSHIP IN [LOC HAITI  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Gama  ] said that the partnership between [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Brazilian  ] troops is working well in [LOC Haiti  ] , and that [LOC Brasilia  ] and [LOC Washington  ] need to increase their level of communication . 
Both [PER Gama  ] and [PER Perez  ] expressed interest in continuing to share information with us on efforts in [LOC Haiti  ] . 
[PER Gama  ] noted that the times scheduled for conference calls with [LOC Washington  ] on [LOC Haiti  ] conflict at present with a weekly meeting held by General [PER Felix  ] to coordinate [LOC Haiti  ] efforts . 
Moreover , Under Secretary for [LOC Latin America  ] [PER Antonio Simoes  ] would be out of town all of February , and therefore would not be on the calls . 
The [ORG GOB  ] would endeavor to have someone on the call February 11 , but [PER Gama  ] also asked about the possibility of rescheduling the calls for a more convenient time. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 .
