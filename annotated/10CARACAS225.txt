( C ) SUMMARY: The lack of infrastructure development in the area of the [LOC Faja  ] heavy oil belt projected for development under the [ORG Carabobo  ] bid round projects as well as [ORG PDVSA  ] 's failure to clarify the bidding terms and conditions contributed to [ORG BP  ] and [ORG Statoil  ] decisions not to submit bids for one of projects . 
[ORG Statoil  ] remains committed to securing a long-term project in the [LOC Junin  ] region of the [LOC Orinoco  ] heavy oil belt ; its heavy oil upgrader has been out of service since late 2009 . 
[ORG BP  ] believes [PER Petromonagas  ] and other oil fields may eventually be shut-in because of the current electricity crisis . 
Both companies report that [ORG PDVSA  ] CVP ( the [ORG PDVSA  ] division that manages all mixed company enterprises ) has become more willing to discuss the mixed company model with its private sector partners and has asked for procurement assistance from its international oil company ( [ORG IOC  ] ) partners . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG CARABOBO  ] BID ROUND: On February 5 , [PER EconCoun  ] and [ORG Petroleum AttachC  ] ) ( [ORG PetAtt  ] ) met with [ORG BP  ] President for [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Colombia  ] [PER Joe Perez  ] ( protect throughout ) . 
( Note: [PER Perez  ] discovered immediately following this meeting that he would be transferred to [LOC Alaska  ] after 13 years in [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
End Note ) [ORG PetAtt  ] met separately with [ORG Statoil Venezuela  ] President [PER Anders Hatteland  ] and Vice President for [ORG Business Development Arnfinn Jenset  ] on February <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
[PER Perez  ] maintained that [ORG BP  ] had been prepared to submit a [ORG Carabobo  ] bid up until two days before the January 28 deadline . 
Until January 26 , [ORG BP  ] continued to seek last minute clarification and changes to certain terms and conditions , such as the shadow tax rate and the requirement to pay the windfall profit tax on oil production to the [ORG GBRV  ] in the form of royalty payments . 
[ORG BP  ] also evaluated the difference in risk between greenfield project development in [LOC Venezuela  ] 's [LOC Faja  ] region versus new project development in [LOC Iraq  ] where the infrastructure has already been built . 
[PER Hatteland  ] stated that [ORG Statoil  ] 's opportunities in [LOC Iraq  ] were not a factor in its decision not to bid on [ORG Carabobo  ] . 
He expressed disappointment and surprise that [ORG Chevron  ] and [MISC Repsol-led  ] consortia submitted [ORG Carabobo  ] bids , believing that a universal failure to bid would have forced the [ORG Ministry of Energy and Petroleum  ] ( MENPET ) to revise the terms and conditions . 
He was specifically upset with the [ORG Chevron  ] bid more than that of [ORG Repsol  ] , as he believed it appeared to provide a degree of credibility to the [ORG GBRV  ] that is not warranted . 
According to [PER Hatteland  ] , [ORG Statoil  ] decided " some time ago " that it would not submit a bid , primarily due to the windfall profit tax law . 
He stated that [ORG CNPC  ] and Total had also decided " well ahead of the deadline " not to bid on a [LOC Carabobo  ] project . 
He claimed that a revision of the windfall profit tax would have yielded terms and conditions acceptable for [ORG Statoil  ] . 
[PER Hatteland  ] expressed doubt that the [MISC Repsol-led  ] consortium has the technical expertise and experience to execute a greenfield [ORG Carabobo  ] project. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG PDVSA  ] SHOWS NEW INTEREST IN DISCUSSING THE MIXED COMPANY MODEL: [PER Perez  ] also reported that , on February 11 , the [ORG Venezuelan Association of Hydrocarbon Producers  ] ( [ORG AVHI  ] by its [MISC Spanish  ] acronyms ) would host a seminar on the mixed company model for [ORG PDVSA  ] Vice President [PER Eulogio Del Pino  ] and other [ORG PDVSA  ] CVP board members . 
[PER Perez  ] stated that [PER Del Pino  ] 's approach to the mixed company partners had changed over the last couple of months and he requested that [ORG AVHI  ] host a seminar for " decision makers " to review the execution of the mixed company model . 
[PER Perez  ] underlined that , in the past , [PER Del Pino  ] has refused to meet with the [LOC IOCs  ] as a group to discuss this important topic . 
[ORG AVHI  ] participants included [ORG Chevron Latin America Business  ] Unit president and current [ORG AVHI  ] president [PER Wes CARACAS  ] 00000225 002 OF 003 Lohec , [PER Perez  ] in his capacity as [ORG AVHI  ] vice president for heavy oil , [ORG AVHI  ] vice president for natural gas and [ORG Repsol Venezuela  ] Director [PER Ramiro PC  ] ! ez , and [ORG Statoil  ] 's [PER Hatteland  ] in his capacity as [ORG AVHI  ] vice president for light oil as well as [ORG AVHI  ] Executive Director [PER Luis Xavier Grisanti  ] . 
[PER Hatteland  ] noted that this was the first time [PER Del Pino  ] had agreed to meet collectively with the [LOC IOCs  ] since the 2007 migration of the strategic associations to [MISC PDVSA-led  ] mixed companies . 
He indicated that the meeting itself was a good sign and that [PER Del Pino  ] had expressed interest in " fixing the model . 
" [ NOTE: [PER Hatteland  ] left the meeting an hour early and has not seen the minutes to confirm what , if any , action items were agreed upon . 
END NOTE ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) PDVSA'S REQUESTS FOR PROCUREMENT HELP: [PER Perez  ] explained that [ORG PDVSA  ] CVP 's new attitude towards its minority partners included requests for procurement assistance . 
He gave as an example the lack of drill pipe availability in [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
Rather than work through [ORG PDVSA  ] 's procurement division , [ORG PDVSA  ] CVP asked [ORG BP  ] to procure this basic industry input through its international supply chain . 
[PER Perez  ] stated that [ORG BP  ] is reviewing whether it can legally provide this service under [LOC Venezuela  ] 's various public bid and contracts laws . 
This arrangement would allow [ORG PDVSA  ] to avoid lengthy procurement timelines and processes , including the foreign exchange bottleneck . 
[PER Perez  ] noted that he believed that [ORG PDVSA  ] had requested [ORG Chevron  ] to provide procurement assistance three to four months ago when it initiated a maintenance turn-around ( a temporary shutdown ) of the [ORG PDVSA-Chevron  ] joint venture PetroPiar heavy oil upgrader . 
In order to return the upgrader to operational status and not face a lengthy shutdown , [ORG PDVSA  ] needed to secure parts and material from international markets . 
[PER Hatteland  ] confirmed that [ORG Statoil  ] has agreed to provide procurement assistance to [ORG PDVSA  ] and commented that [ORG PDVSA  ] is in serious trouble if it cannot buy basic petroleum sector supplies. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) PRODUCTION CHALLENGES: [PER Perez  ] provided several examples of the on-going challenges confronted in the [MISC Venezuelan  ] petroleum industry . 
He noted that [ORG PDVSA  ] recently had removed gas compressor units from the [ORG PDVSA-BP  ] mixed company-operated Boqueron oil field for use elsewhere in [ORG Eastern Venezuela  ] , thus limiting the amount of natural gas that could be reinjected into the oil field . 
In October 2009 , a [ORG BP  ] proposal to install a 100 [ORG MW  ] electricity generating plant , a $150 million investment , to service [MISC Petromonagas' Jose  ] upgrader and its related oil fields was rejected by the [ORG PDVSA  ] members of the [MISC Petromonagas  ] board of directors . 
[ NOTE: [LOC Venezuela  ] is in the midst of an electricity crisis and many of its oil fields rely on the national electricity grid . 
See reftels . 
END NOTE ] The [ORG PDVSA  ] board members told [ORG BP  ] that some oil fields would be shut-in as a result of the electricity crisis and thus , the timing of this proposal did not make sense . 
[ NOTE: As a result of [ORG OPEC  ] quota reductions , the [MISC Petromonagas  ] project was shut-in for the first half of 2009 . 
See reftel . 
END NOTE ] More generally , [PER Perez  ] observed that with a 16% natural declination rate in the [LOC Faja  ] , [ORG PDVSA  ] required a permanent drilling program just to maintain production levels . 
He indicated that in the [MISC Petromonagas  ] field , in a prime location in the [LOC Faja  ] , that would equate to completing 18 new wells per year while [PER Petrocedeno  ] ( a [ORG PDVSA  ] mixed company with [ORG Statoil  ] and Total ) , would require 80 new wells per year . 
[PER Perez  ] avoided speculating on how much crude oil [LOC Venezuela  ] might produce at the end of 2010 . 
He noted however , that current [LOC Faja  ] productions costs , from well bore to tanker , amount to $4/barrel , suggesting that [ORG PDVSA  ] 's problems are a result of mismanagement and not a lack of oil revenues. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Hatteland  ] confirmed that [ORG PDVSA  ] recently broke off [PER CARACAS  ] 00000225 003 OF 003 negotiations for the formation of a mixed company to produce crude petroleum in the [LOC Junin  ] 10 block of the [LOC Orinoco  ] heavy oil belt . 
He stated that [ORG Statoil  ] is committed to a long-term project in [LOC Junin  ] , but not at any price or under any conditions and shared that a bonus payment was only one of the unresolved issues that led to the impasse . 
[ORG Statoil  ] believes that [ORG PDVSA  ] is stretched thin with the negotiations to form the [ORG Carabobo  ] mixed companies and with negotiations with the [MISC Chinese  ] and the [MISC Russian  ] consortium for other [LOC Junin  ] block projects , but that the [MISC Venezuelan  ] oil company will re-engage with [ORG Statoil  ] . 
[PER Hatteland  ] confirmed that the upgrader for [ORG Statoil  ] and Total 's existing [LOC Faja  ] mixed company , [MISC Petrocedeno  ] , located in the [MISC Jose  ] petroleum condominium , had been out of service due to maintenance issues since October 31 , 2009 and that it was just now being brought back on-line . 
He noted however , that the upgrader would not produce any " quality product for at least a year . 
" [ORG PDVSA  ] had agreed to several management and operations changes ( NFI ) proposed by [ORG Statoil  ] and Total that [PER Hatteland  ] believes will help the mixed company recover. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) COMMENT: [LOC Venezuela  ] 's economy and government spending depend on oil revenues . 
As the electricity crisis develops , any reduction in the production of crude petroleum will reduce government revenues . 
Perez' accounts of events such as the cannibalizing of gas compressors from installations for use elsewhere and procurement problems , all indicate [ORG PDVSA  ] will find it difficult to maintain current production levels . 
The additional texture provided by [ORG BP  ] and [ORG Statoil  ] concerning the [ORG Carabobo  ] bid round underscores how the [LOC IOCs  ] approach the [MISC Venezuelan  ] situation differently , while all are trying to manage the same types of political risk . 
CVP 's changed attitude towards its minority partners is a good sign , albeit late , but one that suggests [ORG PDVSA  ] 's problems are significant . 
END COMMENT .
