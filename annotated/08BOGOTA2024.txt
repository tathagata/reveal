( C ) Most [ORG GOC  ] officials and outside analysts believe the death of [ORG FARC  ] founder [PER Pedro Marin  ] ( [PER Manuel Marulanda  ] ) will have little impact on the [ORG FARC  ] 's approach to a humanitarian hostage exchange or broader peace talks with the [ORG GOC  ] . 
Peace Commissioner [PER Luis Carlos Restrepo  ] called new [ORG FARC  ] leader [PER Guillermo Saenz  ] ( [PER Alfonso Cano  ] ) a " Leninist ideologue " who will need to consolidate his leadership position . 
Polo [MISC Democratico  ] official [PER Daniel Garcia Pena  ] agreed [PER Cano  ] is committed to " all forms of struggle , " and predicted he will try to strengthen ties with [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
[PER Restrepo  ] and other observers speculated that [PER Marulanda  ] 's death will accelerate desertions and fragmentation within the [ORG FARC  ] , creating opportunities for the [ORG GOC  ] to pursue deals with individual commanders . 
End Summary --------------------------------------------- --- [PER Marulanda  ] 's Death: Improved Prospects for Peace ? --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) The death of [ORG FARC  ] founder and long-time leader [PER Pedro Marin  ] ( [PER Manuel Marulanda  ] ) has triggered speculation about what this means for the [ORG FARC  ] 's approach to a humanitarian hostage exchange , prospects for broader [MISC GOC-FARC  ] peace talks , and the [ORG FARC  ] 's military strategy . 
In the immediate aftermath of [PER Marulanda  ] 's death , [MISC French  ] Foreign Minister [PER Bernard Kouchner  ] said [PER Marulanda  ] 's death " raises great hope " and urged new [ORG FARC  ] leader [PER Alfonso Cano  ] to release the [ORG FARC  ] 's civilian hostages . 
Similarly , [PER Yolanda Pulecio  ] , mother of [ORG FARC  ] hostage and former presidential candidate [PER Ingrid Betancourt  ] , called [PER Cano  ] a " cultured and progressive man " and said any [ORG FARC  ] move to release the hostages would be well-received by the international community. -------------------- Or More of the Same ? -------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Still , in its May 27 communique acknowledging [PER Marulanda  ] 's death--and the appointment of [PER Guillero Saenz  ] ( [PER Alfonso Cano  ] ) as his successor--the [ORG FARC  ] ratified its proposal conditioning humanitarian exchange talks on the [ORG GOC  ] 's demilitarization of [LOC Florida  ] and [LOC Pradera  ] municipalities . 
[ORG GOC  ] Peace Commissioner [PER Luis Carlos Restrepo  ] told us May 30 that [PER Marulanda  ] 's death will not lead to any progress on a humanitarian accord or peace process in the near future . 
[PER Cano  ] is a " Leninist ideologue " who founded the [MISC Colombian  ] Clandestine [ORG Communist Party  ] and the [ORG Bolivarian Movement  ] . 
In the short-term , he will need to consolidate his position and will not be able to show any sign of weakness . 
In fact , [PER Restrepo  ] said [PER Cano  ] may push for heightened military action to show he is in charge. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Restrepo  ] downplayed the notion of a rivalry between [PER Cano  ] and [ORG FARC  ] military leader [PER Jorge Briceno  ] ( [PER Mono Jojoy  ] ) , noting that [PER Cano  ] 's political hard-line complements [PER Jojoy  ] 's military toughness . 
It would have been more difficult for [PER Cano  ] to assert control if [PER Raul Reyes  ] , who saw himself as the [ORG FARC  ] 's political leader , were still alive . 
[PER Restrepo  ] dismissed the other [ORG Secretariat  ] members as lacking stature , saying the [ORG Secretariat  ] is effectively a Cano-Jojoy organization . 
New [ORG Secretariat  ] member [PER Jorge Torres  ] ( [PER Pablo Catatumbo  ] ) functions as [PER Cano  ] 's secretary ; [PER Milton Toncel  ] ( [PER Joaquin Gomez  ] ) will follow [PER Jojoy  ] 's line ; [PER Rodrigo Londono  ] ( [PER Timochenko  ] ) is an " errand boy " who does not command any troops and lives in [LOC Venezuela  ] ; and [PER Luciano Marin  ] ( [PER Ivan Marquez  ] ) also spends most of his time in [LOC Venezuela.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Former Peace Commissioner for Presidents [ORG Barco  ] and [PER Gaviria Carlos Eduardo Jaramillo  ] told us the [ORG FARC  ] identified [PER Cano  ] as [PER Marulanda  ] 's eventual successor near the end of the [LOC Caguan  ] process . 
He agreed with [PER Restrepo  ] 's assessment that the [ORG FARC  ] would not change its strategy in the short-term , noting that " the [ORG Secretariat  ] functions as a collegial decision-making body . 
" [PER Marulanda  ] 's death signals a generational shift in the [ORG FARC  ] leadership , with power passing from the peasant founders to more urban , [ORG Communist Party  ] educated leaders who were active in protest movements in the 1970s , but the group 's commitment to armed confrontation is unlikely to change. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Polo Secretary General and former President [PER Samper  ] peace advisor [PER Daniel Garcia Pena  ] also predicted [PER Marulanda  ] 's death will mean little to the [ORG FARC  ] 's day-to-day management of the war . 
[PER Marulanda  ] was a [ORG FARC  ] icon and unifying figure , but the transition to Cano--who was [PER Marulanda  ] 's choice--was relatively smooth . 
The murder of [ORG Secretariat  ] member [PER Manuel Munoz  ] ( [PER Ivan Rios  ] ) by his own men and the desertion of [PER Nelly Avila  ] ( [PER Karina  ] ) were bigger blows to the group because of what they say about [ORG FARC  ] morale . 
[PER Garcia Pena  ] views [PER Cano  ] as an intransigent ideologue who is less pragmatic than [PER Jojoy  ] and is committed to " all forms of struggle . 
" He added that the [ORG FARC  ] has yet to name a replacement for [PER Raul Reyes  ] as head of the [ORG FARC  ] 's [ORG International Relations Department  ] , making any change in position on a humanitarian accord more difficult . 
[PER Restrepo  ] noted that the disruption of the [ORG FARC  ] 's international network after [PER Reyes'  ] death will also complicate any [ORG FARC  ] shifts on an exchange. ---------------- [PER FARC-Chavez Ties  ] ---------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Garcia Pena  ] expects [PER Cano  ] to try to strengthen the [ORG FARC  ] 's political ties with [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Hugo Chavez  ] , since [PER Chavez  ] provided the group important " political oxygen " before the [MISC Colombian  ] military attack on the [PER Reyes  ] camp in [LOC Ecuador  ] . 
[PER Chavez  ] will need to be careful about supporting the [ORG FARC  ] given the [PER Reyes  ] computer files , but [PER Chavez  ] and important sectors of his movement continue to see the [ORG FARC  ] as a potential military ally in the event of a [LOC U.S.  ] invasion . 
Hence , [PER Chavez  ] will continue to look for ways to help the [ORG FARC  ] and , to a lesser extent , the [ORG ELN  ] . 
[PER Restrepo  ] also believes [PER Chavez  ] will continue to help the group , but said [PER Marulanda  ] 's historical role held a special attraction for [PER Chavez  ] . 
With his passing , [PER Chavez  ] would no longer have an interlocutor of equal stature within the [LOC FARC.  ] --------------------------------------------- --------- Prospects for Increased [ORG FARC  ] Desertions , Fragmentation --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Prior to [PER Marulanda  ] 's death , local [ORG ICRC  ] delegate [PER Barbara Hintermann  ] said the increasing [MISC Colombian  ] military pressure on the [ORG FARC  ] was disrupting [ORG Secretariat  ] command-and-control over [ORG FARC  ] fronts , giving greater autonomy to individual [ORG FARC  ] commanders and leading to more desertions . 
She speculated that the death of [ORG FARC Secretariat  ] members [PER Raul Reyes  ] and [PER Ivan Rios  ] would accelerate [ORG FARC  ] desertions , including some senior [ORG FARC  ] officials . 
Presidential advisor [PER Jose Obdulio Gaviria  ] told us [PER Marulanda  ] 's demise completes the [ORG Secretariat  ] 's disintegration . 
The [ORG Secretariat  ] 's members cannot communicate or take decisions . 
Only [PER Cano  ] and [PER Jojoy  ] give it a sense of national structure and international projection . 
He said the [ORG GOC  ] needs to try to negotiate a partial peace deal with [PER Jojoy--who  ] he considers more reasonable than Cano--or to seek deals with individual front commanders. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Restrepo  ] told us that on May 22 , he spoke with [ORG FARC  ] commander [PER Jose Cabrera  ] ( [PER Fabian Ramirez  ] ) who questioned [PER Restrepo  ] about the legal benefits he might receive if he were to turn himself in with [PER Ingrid Betancourt  ] . 
[PER Ramirez  ] said he did not have physical control of [PER Ingrid  ] , but implied he might be able to negotiate her release as well . 
[PER Restrepo  ] noted that [MISC Ramirez'  ] profile--substantial narcotics wealth managed by his family , unhappiness with his superiors , and concern about the [ORG FARC  ] 's future--applies to other [ORG FARC  ] commanders such as 1st Front commander [PER Gerardo Aguilar  ] ( [PER Cesar  ] ) . 
He promised to keep us posted as the [PER Ramirez  ] situation evolves. --------------------------------------------- ------- The [ORG ELN  ] Path: [ORG Internal Division  ] and [ORG Military Decline  ] --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
Former Foreign Minister and current Cambio editor [PER Rodrigo Pardo  ] speculated that [PER Marulanda  ] 's passing opens the prospect that the [ORG FARC  ] will end up like the [ORG ELN  ] after the death of " Father [PER Manuel Perez  ] " in 1998 . 
Without its long-time leader , the [ORG ELN  ] has entered a steady process of decline , characterized by internal divisions , diminishing military capacity , and erratic participation in peace processes with the [ORG GOC  ] .
