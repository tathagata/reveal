BACKGROUND ---------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The 2006-2007 legislative session of the [ORG Althing  ] began October 2 and adjourned early this year , on March 18 , because of the May 12 parliamentary elections . 
Members of parliament ( MPs ) are thus granted approximately two months to launch their re-election campaigns and lobby for the support of their respective political parties . 
The [ORG Althing  ] passed a total of 114 bills and 33 resolutions , and 34 unscheduled debates took place [ Comment: MPs can request time to discuss topics they think are relevant at the moment , such as top news stories and possible parliamentary response to them .

] Despite a packed agenda and heated debates over both small and large issues , which are characteristic of short pre-election legislative sessions , the MPs still managed to show great efficiency in passing laws . 
ONE CONTENTIOUS ISSUE... ------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) As always there were several hotly contested issues in the 2006-2007 session . 
MPs spent approximately 70 hours debating the merits of a bill to reestablish the state-run [ORG Icelandic National Broadcasting Service  ] ( [ORG RUV  ] ) as a public corporation . 
Proponents of the bill argued that it would grant the institution increased flexibility and a better market position , as well as strengthen its role as a public service broadcaster . 
The opposition parties initiated a filibuster , but in the end the coalition partners were successful in hammering the bill through. ...BUT OTHERS NOT TO BE FORGOTTEN --------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The parliament unanimously passed a bill that reduces the food Value Added Tax ( VAT ) and commodity tax , that is expected to deliver a 7-10 percent decrease in food prices for the average [MISC Icelandic  ] family . 
In addition , MPs passed a campaign finance reform bill that limits the contributions of individuals and corporations to political parties , but increases direct state funding. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [ORG Althing  ] passed a bill establishing a more robust legal framework for the [ORG Iceland Crisis Response Unit  ] ( [ORG ICRU  ] ) and other [MISC Icelandic  ] participation in international peacekeeping projects . 
The bill clearly delineates the legal rights of peacekeepers , responsibilities , rights , and duties , and enshrines a more civilian role for the [ORG ICRU  ] . 
Observers consider the passing of this bill important because the [ORG GOI  ] 's increase in contributions to international peacekeeping operations , both through the [ORG ICRU  ] and by funding to [ORG UN  ] peacekeeping operations , has gone up drastically in the past few years. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) In November last year the [ORG Liberal Party  ] criticized the government for allowing the free passage of labor from [ORG EU  ] states in [LOC Eastern Europe  ] , and mishandling of integration policies for immigrants . 
The government reacted quickly and allocated ISK 100 million ( 1.4 million USD ) for [MISC Icelandic  ] classes for foreigners and will put a halt on labor coming from new [ORG EU  ] member states [LOC Romania  ] and [LOC Bulgaria  ] until January 1 , 2009 . 
On a related note the law on [MISC Icelandic  ] citizenship was amended in March , stipulating that applicants for citizenship must pass an [MISC Icelandic  ] language test in order to become an [MISC Icelandic  ] citizen. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The Minister of Justice introduced a bill to amend the Chapter on Sexual Offenses in the General [PER Penal Code  ] in March last year , but the [ORG Althing  ] did not pass the bill until the final days of the 2006-2007 legislative session . 
The bill broadened the definition of rape , and essentially legalized prostitution as a main source of income , but banned its public advertising and use of intermediaries ( pimps ) . 
EXIT OF POLITICAL HEAVYWEIGHTS ------------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) During the recent parliamentary session one [ORG MP  ] passed away and seven MPs resigned from the [ORG Althing  ] . 
The most notable of the seven were [PER David Oddsson  ] ( [ORG Independence Party  ] ) and [PER Halldor Asgrimsson  ] ( [ORG Progressive Party  ] ) , who each had served as Prime Minister and Foreign Minister . 
Consequently , the [ORG Independence  ] and [ORG Progressive Parties'  ] ( the ruling coalition partners ) leadership changed as well when [PER Oddsson  ] and [PER Asgrimsson  ] resigned as chairmen of their parties . 
In addition , three MPs switched parties , without affecting the balance of power . 
[ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000087 002 OF 002 <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: In the run-up to parliamentary elections , the MPs can point to electorate-friendly successes such as the food VAT reduction and acts to step up the integration of immigrants to [LOC Iceland  ] . 
[PER David Oddsson  ] 's and [PER Halldor Asgrimsson  ] 's departures marked a changing of the guard that signals a generational shift in [MISC Icelandic  ] politics . 
A number of new people emerged in the parties' primary elections this winter and there is speculation that almost half of the current MPs could be replaced .
