( C ) Summary: Madame Secretary , Embassy [LOC Brussels  ] welcomes your visit to [LOC Brussels  ] on December 3-4 and your meetings with the in-coming [MISC Belgian  ] Prime Minister , [PER Yves Leterme  ] , and the Foreign Minister , most likely [PER Steven Vanackere  ] . 
Your visit occurs at a moment when [MISC Belgians  ] are poised to take a leading role in [LOC Europe  ] -- their former Prime Minister , [PER Herman Van Rompuy  ] , has just been named as the first [ORG European Council  ] President under the new circumstances of the [ORG Lisbon Treaty  ] , and the [MISC Belgian  ] government is preparing itself to hold the rotating presidency of the [ORG EU Council  ] for the six months beginning July 1 , 2010 . 
Embassy [LOC Brussels  ] believes that properly motivated , [LOC Belgium  ] can be a leader in mobilizing [LOC Europe  ] to assist the [LOC United States  ] in meeting two of the key challenges faced by the [MISC Transatlantic  ] community -- [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Guantanamo  ] . 
Hopefully , long-simmering tensions between the [MISC Flemish  ] and francophone regions and linguistic communities will not distract [LOC Belgium  ] from this opportunity . 
Other opportunities for cooperation exist on [LOC Africa  ] policy , nuclear disarmament in [LOC Europe  ] and [LOC Iran  ] . 
The PM or Foreign Minister may try to promote the candidacy of former [MISC Belgian  ] Foreign Minister [PER Louis Michel  ] for the next President of the [ORG UN General Assembly  ] and may again raise Belgium’s failure to be included as a participant or observer at the [MISC G-20  ] talks , despite being the 18th largest economy in the world . 
End Summary . 
TAKING A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN [LOC EUROPE  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) For the past few months , Embassy [LOC Brussels  ] has been working to set the stage for a change in Belgium’s self-concept as a small , meek country living in the shadow of [LOC France  ] and [LOC Germany  ] , to a country that can show leadership in [LOC Europe  ] in spite of stretched financial and material resources , mainly by becoming more vocal on the need for [LOC Europe  ] to assist in the closing of [LOC Guantanamo  ] and on the need to support the new [LOC Afghanistan  ] strategy . 
Your visit is a chance to foster and encourage this transformation . 
In fact , of course , the transformation began at home in [LOC Belgium  ] in 2007 when a new government , made up of a motley coalition of [PER Christian Democrats  ] , [MISC Socialists  ] , [MISC Liberals  ] and Humanists from both sides of the linguistic border , came to power . 
The Prime Minister then , and now again with the departure of [PER Van Rompuy  ] to the [ORG EU  ] , was [PER Yves Leterme  ] , a [MISC Flemish  ] [PER Christian Democrat  ] . 
Formation of the government was delayed for nearly a year because of difficult issues of power-sharing between the [MISC French  ] and [MISC Flemish  ] communities , many of which still remain to be solved . 
STEPPING UP IN [LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] -------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Nevertheless , the new Defense Minister , [PER Pieter De Crem  ] , with sometimes grudging support from [PER Leterme  ] and others in the cabinet , reoriented Belgium’s defense policy . 
Where his predecessor had promoted a mainly humanitarian , [ORG EU  ] and [ORG UN  ] support role for the [MISC Belgian  ] military , [PER De Crem  ] sought to re-establish [LOC Belgium  ] as a small but reliable [ORG NATO  ] ally . 
As a result , Belgium’s troop commitment to [ORG NATO  ] ISAF operations in [LOC Afghanistan  ] has increased from about 250 troops to nearly 540 , with further increases , perhaps to 680 , in the offing . 
[MISC Belgians  ] provide security for [LOC Kabul  ] airport , operate and maintain six [MISC F-16’s  ] in [LOC Kandahar  ] , run one [ORG Operational Mentoring  ] and [ORG Liaison Team  ] in [LOC Kunduz  ] with a second due to arrive in January , and participate in a [MISC German-run  ] PRT . 
This increase has been achieved against a background of declining resources which have required a thoroughgoing restructuring of the armed forces and recall of peacekeeping troops in [LOC Kosovo  ] and [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
The government has also bucked critics inside and out of government who prefer a more pacifist , less [MISC NATO-oriented  ] approach and are ever ready to make political hay out of possible casualties . 
Minister [PER De Crem  ] moreover has reacted positively to suggestions from the Ambassador that he become more vocal in his support as a way perhaps to help shore up the support of other partners . 
[LOC Belgium  ] deserves your appreciation and praise for its efforts , and although further increases in military contrib SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR BILATERAL MEETINGS WITH [MISC BELGIAN  ] LEADERS DURING THESECRETARY’S DECEMBER 3-4 VISIT TO [LOC BRUSSELS  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) On the other hand , Belgium’s contribuQions to civilian development in [LOC Afghanistan  ] have not kept pace . 
In April 2009 , the [ORG GOB  ] announced that it was doubling its financial assistance to the country to 12 million euros a year . 
This figure is only about 0.75 percent of its global budget for official development assistance . 
The [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] has been considering sending 2-4 police trainers to [LOC Afghanistan  ] but has hesitated over concerns for their security . 
Your unambiguous urging of more civilian assistance to [LOC Afghanistan  ] with both the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister can help to increase resources devoted to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
SPURRING ON CLOSURE OF [LOC GUANTANAMO  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The Embassy has been encouraging [LOC Belgium  ] to take a leadership role in [LOC Europe  ] in the closure of the [LOC Guantanamo  ] detention center . 
In October , [LOC Belgium  ] resettled one detainee , whose successful integration should be reassuring to [MISC Belgian  ] officials . 
We are discussing the transfer of two [MISC Tunisian  ] detainees who have already been convicted of crimes in [LOC Belgium  ] , not as part of the “placement” of detainees , but instead as part of our [ORG Department of Justice  ] working with the [MISC Belgian  ] [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] ( our hope is that that process will make it easier for [MISC Belgian  ] society to accept the return , and also allow us to ask the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] separately to take others ) . 
We have also begun to suggest the possibility of [LOC Belgium  ] stepping forward from the chorus line and up to the footlights on [LOC Guantanamo  ] . 
Helping solve the USG’s -- and [MISC Europe’s  ] -- problem with [LOC Guantanamo  ] is a low-cost way for [LOC Belgium  ] to attain prominence in [LOC Europe  ] . 
There are signs that Belgium’s reticence is beginning to chafe its leadership . 
Complaints about Belgium’s exclusion from [MISC G-20  ] membership , and opposition to perceived influence of a “directoire” of large countries in the [ORG EU  ] are examples . 
It is a matter of convincing [LOC Belgium  ] that not only does it have self-interest in a more assertive role , but it also has a uniquely trusted character within [LOC Europe  ] that permits it to be effective . 
Embassy [LOC Brussels  ] suggests the time is right to ask [LOC Belgium  ] to take more than a handful of detainees and ask in coordination with others ( as led by [LOC Belgium  ] ) , so that [LOC Guantanamo  ] -- which [MISC Europeans  ] always so roundly condemned -- is closed once and for all . 
POLITICAL PITFALLS IN REGIONAL TENSIONS --------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) With three regions , three linguistic communities , seven parliaments and a myriad of political parties , domestic politics and the division of powers in [LOC Belgium  ] require a complicated and delicate series of compromises . 
[PER Herman Van Rompuy  ] , though [MISC Flemish  ] , was one politician who seemed able to gain the confidence and trust of both [MISC Flemish  ] and francophone [MISC Belgians  ] . 
His most likely successor , [PER Yves Leterme  ] , is more identifiably [MISC Flemish  ] and does not share that reputation . 
One difficult issue , Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde , or BHV , symbolizes the divisions and carries unusual emotional power in [LOC Belgium  ] ( ref A ) . 
In essence , it is a question of whether residents of the [LOC Brussels  ] suburbs should live and vote under [MISC Flemish  ] control or have special francophone voting and social rights . 
The issue impeded formation of a government after the 2007 elections and was kicked down the road ever since . 
A special effort will have to be made before March 2010 to either once again delay a solution or reach a final compromise . 
Failure to do so could threaten Leterme’s coalition in the first part of the year . 
The fact that all [MISC Belgian  ] politicians dearly want to avoid embarrassment during Belgium’s [ORG EU  ] presidency will motivate them to find the necessary compromises , but there is no guarantee they can . 
INTEREST IN ENHANCED AFRICA COOPERATION --------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Central [LOC Africa  ] is a special interest of [LOC Belgium  ] , as the former colonial power in the [LOC Democratic  ] [LOC Republic of  ] the [LOC Congo  ] ( [ORG DRC  ] ) , [LOC Rwanda  ] and [LOC Burundi  ] . 
As such , the [ORG GOB  ] is eager to cooperate with the [LOC United States  ] on encouraging security sector reform in the [ORG DRC  ] , consolidating peace in the [MISC Eastern  ] [ORG DRC  ] , promoting regional economic integration and cooperation among states in the region on security issues . 
In particular , [LOC Belgium  ] is as interested in preventing sexual violence as we are . 
It would like us to encourage continued cooperation between [LOC Rwanda  ] and the [ORG DRC  ] to take a firmer hand with rebel groups that operate in [LOC Eastern Congo  ] and far too often commit atrocities .

INTEREST IN ENHANCED AFRICA COOPERATION --------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Central [LOC Africa  ] is a special interest of [LOC Belgium  ] , as the former colonial power in the [LOC Democratic  ] [LOC Republic of  ] the [LOC Congo  ] ( [ORG DRC  ] ) , [LOC Rwanda  ] and [LOC Burundi  ] . 
As such , the [ORG GOB  ] is eager to cooperate with the [LOC United States  ] on encouraging security sector reform in the [ORG DRC  ] , consolidating peace in the [MISC Eastern  ] [ORG DRC  ] , promoting regional economic integration and cooperation among states in the region on security issues .

It would like us to encourage continued cooperation between [LOC Rwanda  ] and the [ORG DRC  ] to take a firmer hand with rebel groups that operate in [LOC Eastern Congo  ] and far too often commit atrocities . 
When you met Belgium’s former [LOC BRUSSELS  ] 00001580 003 OF 003 foreign minister , [PER Karel De Gucht  ] , last February , you discussed naming a bilateral task force to meet in [LOC Washington  ] to discuss security sector reform in the [ORG DRC  ] . 
This has not yet occurred , because the [MISC Belgians  ] opted to wait until the new [MISC USG Africa  ] team was in place . 
We are now ready to move ahead with this . 
In November , [LOC Belgium  ] announced an increase in assistance to [LOC Burundi  ] , making it the largest bilateral donor to that country . 
It plans to do the same for the [ORG DRC  ] . 
MULTILATERAL APPROACH TO EUROPEAN DISARMAMENT --------------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) [LOC Belgium  ] has a special interest in nuclear non-proliferation issues because it participates in [LOC NATO’s  ] nuclear forces at the [MISC Kleine Brogel  ] air force base . 
It rejected a recent overture from [LOC Germany  ] to join with the [LOC Netherlands  ] , [LOC Italy  ] and [LOC Germany  ] to propose to the rest of [ORG NATO  ] that nuclear weapons be removed from those countries ( ref B ) . 
However , [MISC Belgian  ] MOD and MFA officials apparently had to rein in then-Foreign Minister [PER Leterme  ] when he initially responded too positively to the idea . 
Belgium’s official policy rejects a unilateral approach to disarmament and insists that the issue must be discussed among all [ORG NATO  ] members at one time , with due regard for [MISC U.S.-Russian  ] bilateral discussions and the NPT . 
The government is also opposing a proposal from the floor of the [MISC Belgian  ] parliament to ban nuclear weapons from [MISC Belgian  ] soil . 
[LOC IRAN  ] SANCTIONS IF NECESSARY --------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [LOC Belgium  ] shares our concern about [MISC Iranian  ] efforts to develop a nuclear capability . 
It supports strengthened sanctions in the [ORG EU  ] and [ORG UN  ] if necessary . 
In that case , at least at first , it prefers to see existing sanctions made more effective , rather than extending them into entirely new areas , with the possible exception of a conventional arms embargo . 
FORMER FM LOUIS MICHEL’S CANDIDACY FOR UNGA PRESIDENT --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) One issue the Prime Minister or Foreign Minister may raise is a request for support for the candidacy of former [MISC Belgian  ] Foreign Minister [PER Louis Michel  ] for President of the [ORG UN General Assembly  ] ( ref C ) . 
As you know , we do not discuss our voting intentions for such posts . 
They have already discussed this issue with Assistant Secretary [PER Gordon  ] and with Ambassador [PER Gutman.  ] .</pre></code>
