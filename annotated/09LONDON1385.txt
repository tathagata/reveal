( C ) Summary .

End Summary . 
[ORG USG Engagement  ] -------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG Commonwealth Secretariat  ] Director of Political Affairs [PER Amitav Banerji  ] reiterated to [ORG Poloff  ] [ORG Commonwealth  ] SYG [PER Kamalesh Sharma’s  ] desire for “strategic engagement” with the [ORG USG  ] on June 11 . 
Noting the important role of electoral commissions in conducting credible elections , [PER Banerji  ] said [PER Sharma  ] hopes to create a network of electoral commissions across the [ORG Commonwealth  ] , whereby newer commissions in fragile democracies could receive guidance and support from commissions in more established democracies . 
He offered this initiative as an example of where the [ORG USG  ] and [ORG Commonwealth  ] have mutual interests and where the [ORG USG  ] could use the Commonweath’s technical electoral commission capacity-building capability and independent , “baggage free” status to promote democracy abroad . 
[LOC Fiji  ] ---- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Noting that the [ORG Commonwealth  ] had past the deadline set at the May [ORG CMAG  ] meeting to re-consider full suspension of [LOC Fiji  ] ( reftel ) , [PER Banerji  ] said he was very “frustrated” that [ORG CMAG  ] had not yet met to discuss [LOC Fiji  ] , especially as the [MISC Commonwealth’s  ] credibility could be damaged by not taking a decision as indicated at the last meeting . 
He said [ORG CMAG  ] had not met purely for scheduling reasons , and that the [ORG Secretariat  ] hopes to hold the meeting by the end of the month , though he was not confident it would be possible . 
He thought [ORG CMAG  ] would move for full suspension of [LOC Fiji  ] , intimating there had been difficult discussions at the previous [ORG CMAG  ] meeting on [LOC Fiji  ] with [LOC New Zealand  ] pushing hard for full suspension and [LOC Malaysia  ] wanting to ensure that [LOC Fiji  ] did not withdraw from the [ORG Commonwealth  ] to pre-empt a full suspension a la [LOC Zimbabwe  ] . 
[LOC Sri Lanka  ] --------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Banerji  ] said that the human rights situation in [LOC Sri Lanka  ] during and after the recent military offensive had been raised “informally and off the record” by the [LOC UK  ] during the last [ORG CMAG  ] meeting , forcing a difficult conversation with the [MISC Sri Lankan  ] Foreign Minister , as [LOC Sri Lanka  ] is currently a member of [ORG CMAG  ] . 
[PER Banerji  ] said the [ORG Commonwealth  ] continues to watch the situation in [LOC Sri Lanka  ] and noted that [MISC Sri Lanka’s  ] offer to host the next [ORG Commonwealth  ] Heads of [ORG Government Meeting  ] ( [ORG CHOGM  ] ) had been turned down over concerns about lending international credibility to the Government’s actions . 
[LOC Nigeria  ] ------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [ORG Commonwealth  ] is also keeping a watchful eye on [LOC Nigeria  ] , [PER Banerji  ] noted , as it is “punching well below its weight” and President Yar’Adua’s sudden death has the potential to prompt a constitutional crisis . 
The [ORG Commonwealth  ] would like to see [LOC Nigeria  ] more active in the region and in the [ORG Commonwealth  ] across the board . 
[PER Banerji  ] noted that [PER Yar’Adua  ] did not make a single intervention at the last [ORG CHOGM  ] , contrasting sharply with former President [PER Obsanjo LONDON  ] 00001385 002 OF 002 who had been active in [ORG Commonwealth  ] affairs . 
Succession of the Head of the [ORG Commonwealth  ] ------------------------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Banerji  ] acknowledged that succession of the Head of the [ORG Commonwealth  ] would have to be dealt with when Queen [PER Elizabeth passes  ] , as there is no rule stipulating that the [MISC British  ] monarch is the head and no procedure for selecting a new head . 
He acknowledged that heir-apparent to the [MISC British  ] Crown , [PER Prince Charles  ] , does not “command the same respect” as the Queen and said the [ORG Commonwealth  ] was trying quietly to get him more involved in [ORG Commonwealth  ] affairs . 
[PER Banerji  ] noted [LOC Marlborough House  ] , the [ORG Commonwealth  ] Secretariat’s current location , was a royal property , owned and funded by the [ORG British Royal Family  ] , and mused that may be a factor in the discussions . 
He noted that succession was not actively being discussion within the [ORG Commonwealth  ] .
