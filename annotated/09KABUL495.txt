( [ORG S/NF  ] ) SUMMARY . 
[MISC Iranian  ] government officials routinely encourage [ORG Parliament  ] to support anti-Coalition policies and to raise anti-American talking points during debates . 
Pro-Western MPs say colleagues with close [MISC Iranian  ] contacts accept money or political support to promote [MISC Iran’s  ] political agenda . 
Some staff members believe [MISC Iranian  ] intelligence officials have infiltrated the [ORG Parliament’s  ] legal and information technology support offices , compromising the professional staff’s legal advice and the legislature’s electronic communications . 
Allegations are difficult to verify and may be inspired more by conspiracy theories and inter-ethnic rivalries than actual facts . 
However , the number of MPs willing to tell us of first-hand encounters with [MISC Iranian  ] agents appears to confirm a dedicated effort by [LOC Iran  ] to influence [MISC Afghan  ] attitudes toward Coalition forces and other issues . 
End Summary . 
[ORG Iranian Embassy Relations  ] with [ORG Parliament  ] ----------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] officials exploit contacts with a number of [MISC Afghan  ] politicians to influence [ORG Parliament’s  ] agenda . 
Many [MISC MPs  ] accuse [PER Hazaras  ] , who like [MISC Iran’s  ] leaders are mostly [PER Shia Muslims  ] , of having the closest ties with [LOC Iran  ] . 
Moderate [PER Hazaras  ] insist [MISC Iranian  ] outreach influences only conservative [PER Hazaras  ] , many of whom received religious educations or lived in [LOC Iran  ] while in exile . 
[MISC MPs  ] single out [PER Sayed Hussein  ] [PER Alemi Balkhi  ] ( [LOC Kabul  ] ) , [PER Ahmad Ali Jebraili  ] ( [LOC Herat  ] ) , and [PER Ustad Mohammad Akbari  ] ( [LOC Bamyan  ] ) as the [MISC Hazara MPs  ] who receive the most support from [LOC Iran  ] . 
The [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] has also cultivated deep relations with members of opposition groups ( including the [ORG United Front  ] ) , [PER Tajik Sayeds  ] , and [MISC MPs  ] from [LOC Herat  ] and other western provinces. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] officers frequently visit [ORG Parliament  ] , but rarely sit in the public gallery and usually avoid high-traffic morning hours , according to [ORG Parliament  ] watchers . 
After Iranian-influence allegations exploded a few years ago , the [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] began hosting [MISC MPs  ] more often at off-site meetings , where other [MISC MPs  ] suspect payments are delivered in exchange for commitments to advocate [MISC Iranian  ] policies. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) According to several contacts , [MISC Iran’s  ] top policy goals in [ORG Parliament  ] are: increasing criticism of civilian casualty incidents caused by Coalition forces , encouraging the [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Parliament  ] to “legalize” foreign forces , advocating rights for [PER Shia  ] ( including a separate judicial system ) , promoting “Persian culture , ” and limiting [MISC Western  ] support to [MISC Afghan  ] media . 
These subjects often dominate parliamentary debates , even when not on the official agenda . 
[MISC Iranian  ] Official Hands Over Talking Points to Deputy Speaker ----------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Lower House  ] Deputy Speaker [PER Mirwais Yaseni  ] ( [ORG Nangarhar  ] , [MISC Pashtun  ] ) told [PER PolOff  ] an [MISC Iranian  ] intelligence officer visited his office in mid-February , coinciding with the visit of [MISC Iran’s  ] vice president to [LOC Kabul  ] , to pressure him to allow a debate on the status of Coalition forces that would push other scheduled items from the 2/17 agenda ( Speaker [PER Yunus Qanooni  ] was out of town , leaving [PER Yaseni  ] to chair the session ) . 
The intelligence officer offered to provide “support” to [PER Yaseni  ] if he cooperated . 
[PER Yaseni  ] declined , only to face the wrath of [MISC MPs  ] [PER Balkhi  ] and [PER Akbari  ] , who raised the issue during debate on another item . 
When [PER Yaseni  ] suggested the [MISC MPs  ] wait for a better time to discuss foreign forces , [PER Balkhi  ] accused the deputy speaker of “betraying his country” and being a [MISC Western  ] puppet . 
[PER Yaseni  ] said Balkhi’s and Akbari’s remarks were identical to the talking points provided to him by the [MISC Iranian  ] official earlier that day. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Other [MISC MPs  ] have described similar interactions with [MISC Iranians  ] they believe to be embassy-based intelligence officers . 
Some believe [MISC Iranian  ] officers work in conjunction with [ORG Karzai’s Palace  ] staff to stir up heated reactions from [MISC MPs  ] following civilian casualty incidents . 
Pro-Western [MISC MPs  ] worry that [LOC Iran  ] exploits such incidents to decrease public support for Coalition troop presence . 
The [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] plays a lower-key role on social issues , paying [MISC MPs  ] to support [MISC Persian  ] cultural programs and oppose [MISC Western  ] countries’ support to local media . 
Despite [MISC Iran’s  ] ambitious lobbying efforts , there are limits to MPs’ willingness to toe the [MISC Iranian  ] line . 
A [ORG Lower House  ] debate last November on water rights quickly struck a nationalistic tone , with several [MISC MPs  ] accusing [LOC Iran  ] of “stealing Afghanistan’s water.” No [ORG MP  ] spoke up to disagree . 
Suspicions With Staff , Too ---------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Parliamentary staffers believe the [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] has planted moles in [ORG Parliament’s  ] legal and information technology offices . 
An employee in the [MISC Lower House’s  ] legal affairs and research office told [PER PolOff  ] last fall that his new supervisor was editing the staffer’s responses to questions from [MISC MPs  ] to reflect Iran-friendly interpretations of [MISC Afghan  ] law . 
[ORG Lower House  ] Secretary General [PER Gulam Hassan Gran  ] has repeatedly complained to [PER PolOff  ] that most IT staffers have been trained in [LOC Iran  ] and pass electronic communications to the [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] . 
As a result , [PER Gran  ] and other [LOC Pashtun  ] staff refuse to use [ORG Parliament’s  ] email system . 
Gran’s deputy keeps a list of [MISC MPs  ] who criticize the [LOC U.S.  ] and analyzes trends in anti-U.S. rhetoric . 
Comment ---------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) If [MISC Iranian  ] efforts to influence [MISC MPs  ] are as dedicated as some believe , it means the [MISC Iranian  ] government has successfully identified and exploited [ORG Parliament’s  ] greatest strength: the bully pulpit . 
The four-year-old [ORG Parliament  ] has often struggled to find its role and usually comes out on the losing end in battles with the judicial and executive branches . 
Still , [MISC MPs  ] have been quick learners when it comes to using the media to draw attention to their causes , even if their views are at times incoherent or serve no other purpose than to bad-mouth the government or political rivals . 
[LOC Iran  ] has deftly taken note , forgoing attempts to influence actual legislation and instead exploiting MPs’ proclivity for media coverage . 
By strong-arming [MISC MPs  ] to incorporate [MISC Iranian  ] talking points into their public statements , [LOC Iran  ] has opened a potential channel to influence public and elite opinion against [LOC U.S.  ] goals and policies for [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
At a minimum , [MISC Iranian  ] interference has helped keep [ORG Parliament  ] bogged down in unproductive debates and away from more pressing matters .
