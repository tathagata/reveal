( [ORG S  ] ) Admiral [ORG Fallon  ] , Embassy [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] welcomes you for your second visit to the [LOC UAE  ] as CENTCOM commander . 
As you are aware , deepening ties with the [LOC UAE  ] is all about relationships , and the relationship that most matters on the military front is that with [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] Crown Prince [PER Mohammed  ] bin [PER Zayed  ] ( [PER MbZ  ] ) , who is also Deputy Supreme Commander of the [ORG UAE Armed Forces  ] , has a personal background in the [ORG UAE Air Force  ] , visited [LOC Washington  ] ( [LOC White House  ] and [ORG Pentagon  ] ) in mid-May , and has engaged senior [LOC U.S.  ] military officials for some years on key defense issues . 
Since your visit falls during the fasting month of [LOC Ramadan  ] , a late evening meeting with [PER MbZ  ] will likely be the substantive highlight of your stop in [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] . 
[PER MbZ  ] will be interested in current [LOC U.S.  ] operations in [LOC Iraq  ] and forward thinking on how to deal with [LOC Iran  ] , topics that he also discussed with you at length during your April visit . 
Additionally , [PER MbZ  ] will want your views on potential weapons sales to the [LOC UAE  ] , designed to deter and counter the [MISC Iranian  ] threat , and how those proposed transfers will fare when they undergo [LOC U.S.  ] congressional scrutiny . 
( Note: In spite of [LOC Dubai  ] ruler [PER Mohammed  ] bin [PER Rashid  ] ( MbR ) holding the nominal title of Minister of Defense -- in addition to his positions as [LOC UAE  ] Vice President and Prime Minister -- he is not involved in the practical management of [LOC UAE  ] defense issues . 
We have requested a meeting with him , at which you could thank [LOC Dubai  ] for its hosting of [LOC U.S.  ] ship visits in particular . 
End note . 
) [ORG UAE Cooperation  ] --------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [LOC U.S.  ] enjoys strong defense cooperation with the [LOC UAE  ] , working together in key aspects of the war on terror ; the [LOC UAE  ] has special operations troops on the ground in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and has been a source of security assistance for [LOC Lebanon  ] and the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] , in addition to assisting virtually every trouble spot in the region in need of reconstruction support . 
The nation provides critical basing and over-flight for [LOC U.S.  ] reconnaissance and refueling assets , extensive naval logistics support , and the [ORG Navy  ] 's liberty port of choice in the region ( 425 ships annually ) . 
We suggest you thank [PER MbZ  ] for his strong support for the [ORG U.S. Air Force  ] and [ORG Navy  ] in the [LOC UAE  ] and encourage continued partnership in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and elsewhere in the region . 
A few quantitative measures of bilateral cooperation include: --- 1,300 USAF personnel at [ORG Al Dhafra Air Base  ] ; --- a vigorous training schedule at the [ORG Air Warfare Center  ] at [ORG Al Dhafra  ] ; --- the [MISC F-16  ] [ORG Block  ] 60 program ; --- approximately 425 port visits last year ; --- over 24,000 [LOC US  ] military overflights/landings in 2006 ; --- more than 150,000 [LOC U.S.  ] servicemen and women enjoying liberty annually in the [LOC UAE  ] ; and --- 250 [ORG UAE Special Operations  ] forces serving with the [ORG Coalition  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( possibly increasing to 300 ) to include BMPs and [MISC LeClerc  ] tanks ; --- 150 conventional ground forces with [MISC South African  ] built armored personnel carriers are planned to deploy in support of [LOC OEF  ] , to work directly with [MISC Canadian  ] forces. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) These contributions are significant in scope but also enduring in their continuity over a number of years . 
The ports of [LOC Jebel Ali  ] and [LOC Fujairah  ] are vital to [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Navy  ] interdiction operations , re-supply and sustainment , and combat support efforts across the region . 
[LOC Jebel Ali  ] in [LOC Dubai  ] has hosted more port visits for each of the past three years than any other port outside the [LOC United States  ] . 
In expressing appreciation for this outstanding partnership , you might also remind [PER MbZ  ] that the evolving nature of military requirements mandates an ongoing focus on joint planning , coordination , and strategic interoperability . 
[LOC Iraq  ] ---- [ORG ABU  ] DHABI 00001479 002 OF 004 <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) While the [LOC UAE  ] has offered some political and economic support for [LOC Iraq  ] and identifies [MISC Iraqi  ] stability as a regional priority , the [LOC UAE  ] 's ( all-Sunni ) leadership has over the past several months exhibited a hardened attitude toward Prime Minister al-Maliki , perceiving him as beholden to [LOC Iran  ] and incapable of moving beyond sectarian bias to lead a unified [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The [LOC UAE  ] has in the past favored former Prime Minister [PER Iyad Allawi  ] and has stalled on its commitment to relieve [MISC Iraqi  ] debt ( of $3.5 billion ) in order to avoid al-Maliki claiming credit . 
The [LOC UAE  ] has expressed concern over the continued violence and chaos in and around [LOC Baghdad  ] as well as the failure of the al-Maliki government to improve overall security in the country . 
While clearly skeptical of al-Maliki 's leadership , [PER MbZ  ] also told [ORG SecDef  ] on August 2 that [LOC Iraq  ] had not followed up on signals that the [LOC UAE  ] would welcome an al-Maliki visit -- albeit with a rather cautious welcome mat ( ref C ) . <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Meanwhile , the [LOC UAE  ] has been engaged in regional efforts to facilitate reconciliation between [MISC Sunni  ] and [MISC Shi'a  ] forces . 
The [ORG UAEG  ] has frequently expressed alarm regarding [MISC Iranian  ] influence in [LOC Iraq  ] , and has made attempts to reach out to moderate [MISC Shi'a  ] to encourage their engagement in the [MISC Iraqi  ] political process independently of [LOC Iran  ] . 
The [LOC UAE  ] values and seeks reassurance of continued close consultation on [LOC U.S.  ] plans and strategy involving [LOC Iraq  ] ( and [LOC Iran  ] ) . 
As for its direct consultations with [LOC Baghdad  ] , [ORG Iraqi National Security Adviser  ] Muwaffaq al-Rubaie was in [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] in late June , a visit during which the [LOC UAE  ] leadership apparently sensed that al-Rubaie took the attitude that current [LOC UAE  ] outreach actions in [LOC Iraq  ] were hostile and indirectly justified [MISC Iranian  ] counter-influence . 
Al-Rubaie reportedly focused his efforts on urging the [MISC Emiratis  ] not to support the [MISC Iraqi  ] Sunnis . 
[PER MbZ  ] will certainly be interested in your thoughts on General [PER Petraeus'  ] report to [ORG Congress  ] on [LOC Iraq.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [LOC UAE  ] sent a team to [LOC Baghdad  ] in August to explore options for re-opening its Embassy . 
You may wish to inquire with [PER MbZ  ] about any reports back from the delegation . 
( Note: Concern has been expressed by the [ORG Coalition  ] about the use by terrorists of the [LOC UAE  ] 's abandoned Embassy compound ; coalition forces captured the security chief of the compound , [PER Abu Shinan  ] , and continue to hold him due to his connections with [MISC Sunni  ] insurgent groups . 
The [LOC UAE  ] has expressed concern over his potential release to [MISC Iraqi  ] forces , fearing his execution . 
The [LOC UAE  ] has not maintained diplomatic staff in [LOC Baghdad  ] since the May 2006 kidnapping of one of its diplomats . 
End note . 
) [LOC Iran  ] ---- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER MbZ  ] reiterated to [ORG SecDef  ] that [LOC Iran  ] is the [LOC UAE  ] 's most serious and long-term threat , a theme we hear repeated often in [LOC UAE  ] defense circles ( but not a theme we hear from the more business-oriented leadership of [LOC Dubai  ] ) . 
[PER MbZ  ] may opine that any attempt at dialogue by [LOC Iran  ] should be regarded as a pure faade and he is urgent about setting up a defense architecture against [MISC Iranian  ] missiles . 
Nonetheless , the leadership has also told us they are not in a position to sacrifice $16 billion in annual trade with [LOC Iran  ] , while realizing that this same neighbor and major trading partner is also a potential threat to the [LOC UAE  ] . 
It is worth recalling that the May 10-12 visit of Vice President [PER Cheney  ] to the [LOC UAE  ] was immediately followed by a one-night stopover by [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , who was given a red carpet welcome and gave a defiant anti-U.S. speech at a [LOC Dubai  ] sports arena during his stay. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [LOC Iran  ] is the large neighbor that will not go away , so the [LOC UAE  ] feels a need to engage ( particularly on the economic side and especially in [LOC Dubai  ] ) with a potential foe in this rough and unforgiving neighborhood . 
While assisting our mission in the region , the [LOC UAE  ] leadership has consistently pursued a cautious , non-confrontational public posture towards [LOC Iran  ] . 
In the past the [LOC UAE  ] has been hesitant to participate in certain military exercises designed to show a strong defensive front against [LOC Iran  ] . 
The [LOC UAE  ] did , however , send observers to Leading Edge 07 in October 2006 in the [LOC Gulf  ] , which had a [ORG Proliferation Security Initiative  ] theme . 
The decision to host Eagle Resolve 2008 , with a [ORG Theater Air and Missile Defense  ] theme , should be seen as a praiseworthy [ORG ABU  ] DHABI 00001479 003 OF 004 step . 
[LOC Iran  ] is an adversary to prepare defenses against , which the [LOC UAE  ] is doing , yet it considers economic engagement one of those defenses . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] ----------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) While the [LOC UAE  ] contributes 250 [ORG Special Operations  ] troops to the [ORG Coalition  ] effort in [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( with a potential increase of 50 ) , it has not yet publicly acknowledged this participation . 
The [LOC UAE  ] pursues [LOC Afghanistan  ] reconstruction aid with an emphasis on road networks , mosques , medical facilities and schools and has made efforts at political mediation between [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
In January 2007 LTG Eikenberry escorted [ORG Afghan Armed Forces  ] Chief of Staff General [PER Bismillah Mohammadi Khan  ] to [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] in a bid to deepen direct engagement between the [LOC UAE  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The [ORG UAE Armed Forces  ] Chief of Staff declared himself willing to help in any way possible , including training [MISC Afghan  ] troops . 
[LOC UAE  ] subsequently disbursed another $30 million in general assistance and is renovating two runways in [LOC Afghanistan  ] for military use . 
During the June visit of [MISC Afghan  ] Defense Minister [LOC Wardak  ] to [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] , [PER MbZ  ] agreed to donate ten [MISC Mi-17  ] helicopters to [LOC Kabul  ] . 
One of [PER MbZ  ] 's oft-stated interests in sending [ORG Emirati Special  ] Ops troops to [LOC Afghanistan  ] is to get his military forces battle-hardened so they may effectively confront imported or domestic extremism when called upon to do so back home . 
The [LOC UAE  ] contribution in [LOC Afghanistan  ] warrants our frequent expressions of appreciation . 
Elsewhere in the region ----------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [LOC UAE  ] provides significant humanitarian and security assistance to [LOC Lebanon  ] ; [PER MbZ  ] spoke with [ORG SecDef  ] at some length about the need to bolster [LOC Lebanon  ] 's ability to stand against [MISC Syrian  ] influence . 
The [LOC UAE  ] has been at the forefront of reconstruction efforts , continuing a longstanding de-mining operation , and contributing resources for school construction and hospitals . 
[ORG UAE Air Force C-130s  ] and helicopters have been used in relief efforts . 
The [LOC UAE  ] has also provided [MISC UAE-manufactured  ] pistols ( Caracal ) and ammunition to the [ORG LAF  ] . 
Earlier in the summer the [LOC UAE  ] Foreign Minister had a conversation with [MISC Lebanese  ] PM [PER Siniora  ] on a proposal for a [MISC Muslim  ] force for [LOC Lebanon  ] ( under [ORG UN  ] mandate ) . 
The [LOC UAE  ] seeks to strengthen the [PER Siniora  ] government , having delivered $300 million in assistance to [LOC Lebanon  ] this year , while also seeking limited engagement with [LOC Syria  ] ( to include a mid-July visit by [LOC UAE  ] President Sheikh [PER Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan  ] and a donation of $10 million towards the support of [MISC Iraqi  ] refugees and $100 million to build a hospital in [LOC Syria  ] ) . <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [LOC UAE  ] would like to see tangible progress on the [LOC Middle East  ] Roadmap , rejects the [ORG Hamas  ] agenda , and continues to support the [MISC Palestinian  ] people through more than $400 million in housing and humanitarian assistance since 2000 . 
[PER MbZ  ] and his brothers , Foreign Minister [PER Abdullah  ] and [ORG National Security Advisor/State Security Director Hazza  ] , are in close contact with President [PER Mahmoud Abbas  ] and Prime Minister [PER Salam Fayyad  ] . 
As the result of the May 2007 visit of [ORG USSC General Dayton  ] , the [LOC UAE  ] transferred $80 million to the [MISC Palestinian  ] president . 
Weapons packages -- high [LOC UAE  ] expectations ----------------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [LOC UAE  ] has committed billions to current and anticipated Foreign Military Sales cases , in addition to over $8.5 billion in direct commercial sales in the [ORG Block  ] 60 [MISC F-16  ] program , one of the premier security assistance portfolios in the region . 
At the invitation of the [ORG Pentagon  ] and [ORG State Department  ] to deepen the security relationship by cooperating on an integrated missile defense shield , the [LOC UAE  ] has recently submitted Letters of Request on the Patriot ( nine [MISC PAC-3/GEM-T  ] batteries ) , Surface Launched Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile ( [MISC SL-AMRAAM  ] ) , and [ORG Theater High Altitude Air Defense  ] ( [ORG THAAD  ] ) system ( 3 fire units ) , for an estimated total value of $8 to 12 billion . 
It is now incumbent upon the [ORG USG  ] to make good on our offer of enhanced engagement by pressing for expeditious [ORG Congressional  ] notification this fall ( pressing at every opportunity for favorable results in any congressional [ORG ABU  ] DHABI 00001479 004 OF 004 review of the weapons package ) . 
The [LOC UAE  ] will see our posture as a critical measure of [ORG USG  ] willingness to truly stand by the [LOC UAE  ] in a contingency involving [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [LOC UAE  ] recently signed the [ORG High Mobility Artillery Rocket System  ] ( [ORG HIMARS  ] ) Letter of [PER Offer  ] and Acceptance for counter battery , a case valued at $597M . 
Both [ORG Boeing  ] and [ORG Northrop-Grumman  ] have provided Requests for Information on an [MISC Airborne Early Warning  ] and Control aircraft later this year . 
The [LOC UAE  ] has also expressed a short-term interest in purchasing three [MISC E2-C Hawkeye AEW&C  ] aircraft as an interim solution until delivery of a more permanent [MISC AEW&C  ] platform . 
( Note: That decision is expected in mid-2008 . 
End note . 
) The [LOC UAE  ] has also made a request to buy 40 [MISC UH-60  ] Blackhawk helicopters for its [ORG Special Operations Command  ] . 
They have already signed the Letter of [PER Offer  ] and Acceptance for 26 [ORG Blackhawks  ] , plus a training package , a case valued at $807M . 
They have also purchased 10 [ORG Blackhawks  ] via Direct Commercial Sales from [ORG Sikorsky  ] . 
The [LOC UAE  ] is upgrading its [MISC AH-64 Apache  ] helicopters to the D ( LONGBOW ) model and has requested 1300 Hellfire missiles with the expectation of a request for an additional 1200 missiles . 
Three separate Letters of Request for additional weapons for their F-16s have been received , valued at over $800M . 
( The current [LOC UAE  ] portfolio of active cases handled by [ORG USLO  ] stands at 44 cases , valued at just over $4 billion with another $1.56 billion in cases under development , most of which are expected to be signed by the end of the calendar year . 
These figures do not include the $8-12 billion for the missile defense requests or $1-3 billion estimated for the [MISC AEW&C  ] platform . 
) [ORG Defense Cooperation Agreement  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In spite of differences on status of forces issues and the use of passports/visas versus military IDs/orders for [LOC UAE  ] entry and exit , overall mil-to-mil cooperation with the [LOC UAE  ] has been excellent , with consistently reliable support at [LOC Jebel Ali  ] and [LOC Fujairah  ] ports and at [ORG Al Dhafra Air Base  ] . 
We recently moved routine military cargo flight operations from [LOC UAE  ] civil airports in the northern [LOC Emirates  ] to the [MISC Minhad  ] air station , in accordance with a [LOC UAE  ] request . 
The request enhances force protection considerations but comes with a one-time cost of approximately $4.5 million . 
[MISC Minhad  ] is generally better positioned geographically to support [ORG CENTCOM  ] needs . 
In very limited circumstances when a [MISC C-5  ] is required to land at [LOC Fujairah  ] , the [LOC UAE  ] has granted all requested clearances. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG Embassy  ] believes the timing may be right to make progress on negotiating a new [ORG Defense Cooperation Agreement  ] ( [ORG DCA  ] ) with the [LOC UAE  ] and has suggested submission of a [ORG USG  ] counter-draft in answer to the [LOC UAE  ] draft [ORG DCA  ] presented for possible discussion at October 2-3 Joint Military Committee ( [ORG JMC  ] ) working group meetings in [LOC Tampa  ] and a full [ORG JMC  ] meeting tentatively set for January 2008 in [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] . 
We recommended urging the [LOC UAE  ] to sign a new [ORG DCA  ] superseding the un-ratified 1994 version as the official basis for existing and expanding military-to-military cooperation ( taking care NOT to link the [ORG DCA  ] issue with pending sales or other routine cooperation , which would be seen as unhelpful pressure . 
) Getting the relationship right ------------------------------ <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [LOC UAE  ] 's reliable and enduring support for mutual military interests in the region creates both a sense of momentum in the relationship and high expectations on the part of our hosts . 
They will be looking for your endorsement of our partnership in the form of ongoing consultations on [LOC U.S.  ] intentions in the region ( particularly [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Iran  ] , but also [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Lebanon  ] ) , an honest sense of the congressional mood in terms of weapons sales in the region ( keeping in mind that the [LOC UAE  ] seeks congressional notification of its systems this fall and notification to be handled separately from any other nation , [ORG GCC  ] or otherwise ) , and genuine appreciation for the [LOC UAE  ] role in the region .
