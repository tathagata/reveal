( C ) [MISC Russian  ] DCM [PER Anatoly Martynov  ] told P/E Chief June 11 that a [ORG Russian National Security Council  ] ( [ORG NSC  ] ) delegation is scheduled to visit [LOC Libya  ] June 22-24 . 
According to [PER Martynov  ] , the visit is at the invitation of [ORG Libyan National Security Adviser  ] [PER Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi ( son of [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi ) and stemmed from a meeting in mid-May in [LOC Sochi  ] between [MISC Russian  ] Prime Minister [PER Vladimir Putin  ] and [MISC Libyan  ] Prime Minister al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi . 
The delegation is expected to meet with [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi , [PER Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi and Prime Minister al-Mahmoudi . 
The principal subject to be discussed , according to [PER Martynov  ] , is military training and the potential sale of military equipment to [LOC Libya  ] ( including heavy-lift and tactical cargo aircraft , helicopters , attack aircraft , light armored vehicles , small coastal patrol craft and night vision equipment ) . 
Responding to the Ambassador 's question about the status of the [MISC Russia-Libya Highly-Enriched Uranium/Low-Enriched Uranium  ] ( [MISC HEU-LEU  ] ) Agreement to facilitate the return to [LOC Russia  ] of spent nuclear fuel from [LOC Libya  ] , the [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador said he believed the agreement was now with the General People 's [ORG Committee  ] ( [ORG Cabinet-equivalent  ] ) for approval . 
He suggested that the [ORG NSC  ] delegation would seek to discuss the agreement with GOL interlocutors during the upcoming visit . 
2 . 
( C ) The [ORG NSC  ] visit comes on the heels of a visit last week by a senior [MISC Russian  ] trade delegation headed by [PER Ara Abramyan  ] . 
[PER Abramyan  ] co-chairs the [ORG Russia-Libya Inter-Governmental Commission  ] and , according to [PER Martynov  ] , orchestrated the mid-May meeting of PMs in [LOC Sochi  ] . 
Key subjects of discussion during the trade delegation 's visit were the establishment of a commercial center for refurbishment of [MISC Soviet-era Libyan  ] military equipment and a series of factories in [LOC Libya  ] under the rubric of a joint venture investment scheme . 
[PER Martynov  ] said [MISC Libyan  ] officials had asked in the course of [PER Abramyan  ] 's visit whether [LOC Russia  ] was interested in making a counter-proposal to [LOC Ukraine  ] 's offer to establish a center in [LOC Libya  ] to refurbish [MISC Soviet-era Mi-8  ] helicopters ( reftel ) . 
3 . 
( C ) Comment: [MISC Russia-Libya  ] cooperation has continued apace since the November 2008 visit to [LOC Moscow  ] by [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi , his first in the [MISC post-Soviet  ] era . 
In addition to cooperation in establishing an international gas cartel akin to [ORG OPEC  ] and increased activity by [ORG Gazprom  ] in [LOC Libya  ] , there appears to have been an uptick in military-to-military discussions , which have principally been conducted on the [MISC Libyan  ] side by the [ORG National Security Council  ] .
