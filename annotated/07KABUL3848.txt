( C ) [MISC SUMMARY/INTRODUCTION: Since  ] the fall of the [ORG Taliban  ] in 2001 , [ORG Afghan National Police  ] ( [ORG ANP  ] ) development has lagged behind that of the [ORG Afghan National Army  ] ( [ORG ANA  ] ) . 
Despite the training of over 70,000 [ORG ANP  ] individuals and advances in equipping and recruiting , the police remain largely ineffective and corrupt . 
At the same time , as security conditions have deteriorated , the proportion of [ORG ANP  ] fatalities has climbed and is now markedly higher than that of [ORG ANA  ] in high threat areas . 
To enhance [ORG ANP  ] effectiveness both in the counterinsurgency role and in traditional policing functions , Combined Security [ORG Transition Command ) Afghanistan  ] ( [ORG CSTC-A  ] ) is working closely with the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] ( [ORG MOI  ] ) , Embassy , [ORG ISAF  ] and international community ( [ORG IC  ] ) donors to launch a new program that will train and develop whole police units district by district . 
With [ORG MOI  ] leadership , the Focused District Development ( [ORG FDD  ] ) Program is a new strategy that seeks to make the district uniformed police unit the &building block8 for developing the [ORG ANP  ] , emulating to the extent possible the approach that has proven effective with the [LOC ANA.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) District police units will be removed from their district as a unit for eight weeks training , reequipped , and paired with a Police Mentoring Team ( PMT ) for follow-on training support . 
Other police units will be put in place to provide policing during the unit , s training period . 
Consultations are also taking place with [ORG IRoA  ] officials , USAID , UNAMA and other [ORG IC  ] donors to coordinate the delivery of governance and development assistance to the districts selected for [ORG FDD  ] . 
The [ORG FDD  ] program is scheduled to begin its initial training phase in late December , starting with seven districts in five provinces . 
There will be challenges to address as the program goes forward , including shortfalls in police mentoring teams , accountability , prioritization and absorptive capacity for assistance while meeting recruiting goals . 
But by focusing train-and-equip resources ) including limited numbers of police mentoring teams ) on a handful of districts at one time , [ORG FDD  ] has the potential over time to provide an effective platform for security , development and governance advances throughout [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
END SUMMARY/INTRODUCTION. --------------------------------------------- ----------- THE FULL [ORG FDD  ] CYCLE AND GOALS: RETRAIN , REEQUIP , RENOVATE --------------------------------------------- ----------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [ORG FDD  ] program envisions manning , training , equipping , and providing facilities to an entire district police unit at one time . 
Objectives include recruiting to full authorized levels , replacing ineffective leaders , and transferring the unit to one of [ORG INL  ] , s [ORG Regional Training Centers  ] ( RTCs ) for training . 
The full [ORG FDD  ] training cycle is scheduled as follows: a ) assessment and recruiting: approximately 60 days b ) placement of temporary covering security force: 10 days c ) training of district police force ) 8 weeks plus movement time d ) reinsertion of district police force into district: one week e ) close PMT overwatch: 2 to 4 months <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG CSTC-A  ] 's goal under [ORG FDD  ] is to train and reform all police districts in the country in three to four years , predicated in part on the expectation that the program will create its own momentum as other districts , seeing enhanced security and development benefits , will elect to improve their operations on their own initiative . 
[LOC KABUL  ] 00003848 002 OF 004 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) To allow the staff of an entire police district to be trained simultaneously , [ORG Afghan National Civil Order Police  ] ( [ORG ANCOP  ] ) companies , supported as necessary in some areas by [ORG ANA  ] units , will temporarily replace the entire district police force while the latter undergo training. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Those policemen or new recruits who have not had any training would receive the basic course ; policemen who have already attended the basic course would attend a newly developed advanced course ; and senior officers ( second lieutenant and above ) within the district would go through an officers , course , also newly developed by [MISC INL-contracted  ] civilian police mentors assigned to [ORG CSTC-A  ] and approved by the [MISC INL/NAS  ] office in [LOC Kabul  ] . 
All courses are eight weeks in length . 
To enhance unit coherence , all ranks will be brought together in the final week of instruction to train and work as a single unit . 
[ORG PMTs  ] will remain with the district police during their time at the [ORG Regional Training Center  ] , supplementing the [ORG INL  ] courses with additional and reinforcement training as required. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) District police units , equipment and vehicles will be assessed for usability ; after the training period , their equipment will either be returned , refurbished , or replaced at the end of the course . 
Even as their weapons are evaluated for usability , trainees will continue to receive training with the same type of weapon . 
At the same time , [ORG CSTC-A  ] and [ORG MOI  ] will work in the trainees , home district to improve facilities , establish connectivity with other elements of the security sector , and establish both formal and informal working relationships with local leaders. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Once the district police complete the eight-week training cycle , they will return to their district and reassume their duties . 
As police units are returned home , [ORG ANCOP  ] units will also remain for a short transition period . 
CSTC-A-sponsored [ORG PMTs  ] , composed of professional police and military experts , will remain full time for at least two to four months with the newly-trained and equipped district police units. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) In preparation for the initial training phase , [ORG CSTC-A  ] is sending regional assessment teams in mid-November to all first-tranche districts . 
Led by an [ORG MOI  ] general officer and the PMT , and consisting of interagency [LOC U.S.  ] , [MISC Afghan  ] government ( [ORG IRoA  ] ) and [ORG IC  ] experts , the teams will assess the police force , the status of rule of law and governance in the districts , to determine the number of new recruits , specific training , equipment , facilities , and other supporting requirements needed , and to shape the evolution of rule of law and governance in the district , as well as the linkage to the provincial government. --------------------------------------------- --- DEVELOPMENT BENEFITS TO FOLLOW ENHANCED SECURITY --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Consultations are also taking place with [ORG IRoA  ] officials , USAID , UNAMA and other [ORG IC  ] donors to coordinate the delivery of development and governance assistance to the districts selected for [ORG FDD  ] . 
This will ensure that as regional security is enhanced , districts will benefit directly from energy , infrastructure , rule of law and other programs that [LOC U.S.  ] and allied Provincial Reconstruction Teams ( PRTs ) will help local and regional officials to coordinate . 
[PER Ghulam Jelani Popal  ] , the new Director General of the [ORG Independent Directorate for Local Governance  ] ( [ORG IDLG  ] ) and who reports directly to President [PER Karzai  ] ( reftel ) , has expressed keen interest in the [ORG FDD  ] program . 
Post is seeking to facilitate consultations between [ORG IDLG  ] and [ORG CSTC-A  ] on how [ORG FDD  ] can strengthen local governance in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and how the [LOC KABUL  ] 00003848 003 OF 004 [ORG FDD  ] program can be linked to [PER Popal  ] 's proposal for district-based local self-defense forces and other governance initiatives. ----------------------- FIRST TRANCHE DISTRICTS ----------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [ORG FDD  ] training of the first selected district police units is scheduled to start in late December , with each full cycle taking approximately six to eight months for completion , including monitoring , reassessment , retraining , and sustainment training . 
[ORG CSTC-A  ] consulted closely with [ORG ISAF HQ  ] , the [ORG ISAF Regional Commands  ] , [ORG MOI HQ  ] and senior police officials in developing recommendations to present to Interior Minister [PER Zarar  ] for choosing the first tranche of districts . 
In addition to [ORG MOI  ] input on political and policing factors , [ORG ISAF  ] operational planning considerations will be a significant concern for the first two [ORG FDD  ] cycles , in order to complement -- and not complicate -- other planned operations . 
As [ORG FDD  ] planning extends further into the future , it will instead help shape [ORG ISAF  ] operational planning and more readily synchronize with specific development and governance projects for identified districts. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The districts chosen for the first training cycle include: ( a ) Qalat , [PER Shah Joy  ] , and Tarang wa Jaldak districts in [LOC Zabul  ] province ; ( b ) [ORG Zurmat  ] in [LOC Paktia  ] province ; ( c ) Tag [LOC Ab  ] in [LOC Kapisa Province  ] ; ( d ) [LOC Chahar Dara  ] in [LOC Kunduz  ] province ; ( e ) [LOC Bala Buluk  ] in [LOC Farah Province  ] . 
With the exception of [LOC Chahar Dara  ] in the relatively quiet north , these districts pose varying levels of security challenges , including key strategic infrastructure ( e.g. , the ring road running through the three [LOC Zabul  ] districts ) , known [ORG Taliban  ] transit points ( Tag [LOC Ab  ] , [ORG Zurmat  ] ) , or significant political import ( [LOC Bala Buluk  ] lies adjacent to three districts recently overrun by [ORG Taliban  ] forces in [LOC Farah  ] ) . ---------------- CHALLENGES AHEAD ---------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [ORG MOI  ] officials , initially slow to warm to the [ORG FDD  ] concept , are becoming more involved and actively welcoming the program . 
Interior Minister [PER Zarar  ] is taking an active lead , and this has translated down the ranks ; however , broadening [ORG MOI  ] and government-wide support will depend on achieving early successes in the first seven trial districts. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) The [ORG PMTs  ] will play a key role in the [ORG FDD  ] program , including the assessment and validation of the newly-trained district police units , as well as subsequent periodic reassessments and retraining . 
As critical as [ORG PMTs  ] are to the success of police training , personnel resources have thus far not been available to meet [ORG CSTC-A  ] , s request for 2,500 additional military and civilian police mentors to staff the [ORG PMTs  ] throughout the country . 
These would augment the police trainers and mentors already working in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
At present , [ORG CSTC-A  ] covers this personnel shortfall by concentrating on approximately one third of districts , including having a single PMT conduct area coverage of several districts in some cases . 
[ORG FDD  ] , however , will require [LOC KABUL  ] 00003848 004 OF 004 concentration on specific districts since [ORG PMTs  ] will not have the option of spreading efforts over multiple districts. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [ORG CSTC-A  ] has been consulting with [ORG IC  ] players , in particular the [ORG EU  ] Police mission ( [ORG EUPOL  ] ) , to build [ORG IC  ] support for the concept and to tap [ORG IC  ] resources . 
EU-member state embassy contacts tell us they find [ORG FDD  ] a credible approach to putting police development back on track ; however , it is unclear how much concrete support international partners are willing to lend to the plan . 
[ORG CSTC-A  ] remains open to incorporating [ORG EU  ] police trainers into CSTC-A-sponsored [ORG PMTs  ] , but [ORG EU  ] interlocutors have been hesitant , noting that it would require a change to the [ORG EUPOL  ] mandate to place [ORG EU  ] police mentors at the district level , and may have implications for broader [MISC NATO-EU  ] relations . 
Some individual nations , such as [LOC Norway  ] and [LOC Canada  ] , have offered assistance outside of the [ORG EUPOL  ] mandate , and [ORG CSTC-A  ] welcomes such assistance because it is not constrained by [ORG EUPOL  ] limitations. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) Corruption remains a concern . 
Simultaneously with [ORG FDD  ] , [ORG CSTC-A  ] will press ahead on separate timelines to complete in the next six months the issuance of identification cards to all [ORG ANP  ] , ensure all police districts are using the electronic payment system , and maximize where possible the payment of salaries through electronic transfers . 
[ORG FDD  ] will provide an opportunity to press forward with rank and pay reform and [ORG ANP  ] pay parity with the [ORG ANA  ] which , despite having been approved by the international community in September , have not yet been fully implemented -- or have been implemented inconsistently -- in many districts . 
Also , the presence of [ORG PMTs  ] for 2-4 months following the group training will not only ensure sustainment training , but will also provide a crucial reinforcement of accountability requirements for [MISC U.S.-provided  ] equipment . 
Following the completion of initial training in the districts , we will have to assess the priority development and governance needs , and the absorptive capacity of the districts. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) A critical issue identified in the [ORG CSTC-A  ] concept of operations will be the removal or neutralization of corrupt , criminal and/or inept district police chiefs . 
[MISC Afghan  ] legal constraints bar the outright removal of officers except in the case of a judicial finding , which is a slow and unreliable process . 
[ORG CSTC-A  ] , s JAG team has prepared a draft [ORG MOI  ] disciplinary instruction that is currently under review within the [ORG MOI  ] ; in it , alternative approaches are explored that could include suspension without pay , demotion by up to two ranks , and involuntary retirement . 
Even if new disciplinary measures are approved , it will remain a challenge to empower [ORG MOI  ] officials to impose discipline involving rank or pay in the face of inevitable interference from outside or senior influences . 
In addition , district [ORG ANP  ] patrolmen are often loyal to their chiefs on the basis of tribal and other personal relationships . 
When their district commanders are either removed or quit , [ORG ANP  ] personnel have sometimes deserted or abandoned their posts as a consequence. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [ORG CSTC-A  ] is working with the [ORG MOI  ] on other personnel issues . 
[ORG FDD  ] success will depend on the ability of the [ORG MOI  ] to recruit new personnel into the [ORG ANP  ] . 
A September 2007 [ORG CSTC-A  ] survey of about 76 percent of police districts indicated a shortfall of some 5,500 personnel from authorized billets . 
With advice from [ORG CSTC-A  ] mentors , [ORG MOI  ] recruiters are redoubling their efforts to hire additional recruits . 
It will also be critical to ensure that the pace of [ORG ANCOP  ] recruitment and training is maintained , to ensure sufficient [ORG ANCOP  ] strength to provide the back-fill police presence as district units undergo their two-month training period out of their district .
