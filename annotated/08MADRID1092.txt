( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY: Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] ensured that [LOC Spain  ] 's outgoing Chief of Defense and the Chiefs of the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG Army  ] , [ORG Navy  ] and [ORG Air Force  ] Staff were properly celebrated September <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
Hosting a cocktail reception for more than 90 attendees , complete with a color guard and a 6-piece military jazz band , the Ambassador recognized the exemplary careers of the retiring military leadership and honored the new " cupola . 
" During a round of courtesy calls begun September 15 with the new [ORG CHOD  ] , Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] was able to meet the new leadership one-on-one , reinforcing the excellent military-to-military relationship and engaging the new chiefs on key USG interests . 
The calls also served to introduce his new Deputy Chief of Mission and to explain the [LOC U.S.  ] election timetable that could result in an extended period as Charge d'Affaires. //VALEDICTORY " RAZZMATAZZ " // <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ambassador hosted the reception in honor of General [PER Felix Sanz Roldan  ] , the recently departed [ORG CHOD  ] who has assumed a new role as special envoy for [ORG EU  ] defense matters , and the recently departed Chiefs of [ORG Staff  ] of the [ORG Air Force  ] and [ORG Army  ] and the former [ORG CNO  ] . 
The [ORG CHOD  ] and all the service chiefs were relieved on July 21 ( ref A ) . 
[ORG Naval Station Rota  ] provided a [ORG Joint Color Guard  ] and the [ORG Sixth Fleet Band  ] provided a six-piece [ORG Jazz Ensemble  ] . 
The event , unusual by [MISC Spanish  ] military standards that do not allow for " change of command " ceremonies , per se , was a huge success with the honorees and their wives in attendance as well as the current [ORG CHOD  ] , and the new [ORG Air Force  ] Chief of [ORG Staff  ] and Chief of [ORG Naval Operations  ] . 
Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] addressed each of the outgoing officers and presented flags that had flown over the [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy to retiring [ORG CNO Admiral Zaragoza  ] , former [ORG Air Force  ] Chief of Staff General [PER Garcia de la Vega  ] , and outgoing [MISC Spanish  ] Army Chief of Staff General [PER Villar  ] . 
To General [PER Sanz  ] , the Ambassador presented a framed edition of the " [MISC Don't Tread  ] on [LOC Me  ] " flag flown over [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Navy  ] ships since September 11 , and explained its historical symbolism dating back to the [ORG Revolutionary War  ] . 
[PER Sanz  ] spoke extemporaneously following the Ambassador 's remarks , recalling how his close association with [LOC U.S.  ] forces from the earliest days of his military career had been instrumental to his professional success and his enduring goodwill toward the [LOC United States.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In the lead-up to the unprecedented hail and farewell party , Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] sought courtesy calls with the entire new cupola . 
He congratulated each officer on his new position , reviewed key programs in the jurisdiction of each of the services , and reviewed the robust exchange relationships between [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] military academies and staff colleges. //CHIEF OF DEFENSE GENERAL RODRIGUEZ// <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG Air Force Lieutenant General  ] [PER Jose Julio Rodriguez Fernandez  ] was named Chief of Defense ( JEMAD ) of the [ORG Spanish Armed Forces  ] on July 18 and replaced General [PER Sanz  ] on July 21 ( ref A ) . 
General [PER Rodriguez  ] is a fighter-attack pilot by background . 
With 42 years of military service , he most recently served as the Director General for [ORG Armament and Materiel  ] in the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] ( the senior uniformed acquisition official ) . 
During the Ambassador 's September 15 courtesy call , [PER Rodriguez  ] was pleasant and low-key and conveyed obvious admiration and good feeling toward his predecessor . 
The Ambassador congratulated [PER Rodriguez  ] on his promotion and invited him to take part in the planned reception . 
[PER Rodriguez  ] , who was originally not scheduled to be in town September 25 , told the Ambassador that " things could change " and , in fact , attended. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [ORG CHOD  ] briefed the Ambassador on the meeting of [ORG NATO  ] CHODS he had attended in [LOC Bulgaria  ] the weekend of September 13 , especially the considerable time spent discussing [LOC Georgia  ] . 
[PER Rodriguez  ] also made reference to turning the page in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , expressing the idea that the [LOC U.S.  ] election presented opportunities for the [ORG Zapatero Administration  ] to modify some of its foreign policy positions . 
The Ambassador and the [ORG CHOD  ] agreed there was no baggage between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Spain  ] on [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The Ambassador also referenced shared [MISC Spanish  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] interests in the context of the [ORG U.S. Africa Command  ] . 
The Ambassador sought the [ORG CHOD  ] 's views on the likelihood [LOC Spain  ] would sign a Letter of Agreement by October 31 to purchase [MISC Tomahawk  ] missiles . 
[PER Rodriguez  ] indicated the action was with the [ORG MOD  ] and noted the draft 2009 budget -- with not more than a 5 per cent increase expected over last year -- was not out yet . 
[PER Rodriguez  ] indicated that the [ORG Navy  ] , in accordance with [MISC Spanish  ] procedure , must present its case for this requirement to the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] . 
The Ambassador asked him to let us know if there was a problem . 
Turning to other potential acquisitions , the Ambassador told [PER Rodriguez  ] that the [LOC United States  ] hoped that the [ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] ( [ORG JSF  ] ) could be the solution to [LOC Spain  ] 's long-term requirement for modern tactical aircraft replacements for its [ORG Air Force  ] and [ORG Navy  ] . 
Again citing [LOC Spain  ] 's process for filling these kinds of requirements , [PER Rodriguez  ] allowed that , for the fighter requirement , the process was just beginning . 
Finally , GEN [PER Rodriguez  ] agreed to host [ORG Admiral Fitzgerald for Spain 's National Day  ] observance the weekend of October 11 , including securing an invitation to the King 's reception. //CHIEF OF [MISC SPANISH  ] NAVY STAFF ADMIRAL REBOLLO// <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In office calls on September 18 , the Ambassador reinforced the same points with the new Chief of [ORG Naval Operations  ] and the [ORG Army  ] 's Chief of Staff . 
[ORG Admiral Rebollo  ] , who assumed his duties July 21 , was warm and engaging . 
He had been former [ORG CNO Admiral Zaragoza  ] 's Vice Chief of [ORG Naval Operations  ] and is expected to continue to support [ORG Zaragoza  ] 's naval initiatives . 
He has the distinction of having started his military career as an enlisted man . 
[ORG Rebollo  ] also said the [MISC Tomahawk  ] decision was now going to the [ORG MOD  ] , and he was hopeful but not certain the [ORG MOD  ] would approve the purchase . 
Concerning piracy , the [ORG Admiral observed Spain  ] 's deployment of a [MISC P-3  ] maritime patrol aircraft was more of a political show than a substantive military action . 
The Ambassador asked that [LOC Spain  ] consider hosting the headquarters portion of forthcoming [ORG AFRICOM  ] and [ORG SOCEUR  ] Flintlock exercise ( originally intended for [LOC Mauritania  ] ) , and [ORG Admiral Rebollo  ] agreed to consider it . 
( NOTE: On October 9 we received formal agreement from [LOC Spain  ] to host this important exercise at [LOC Rota  ] . 
End note . 
) //CHIEF OF [MISC SPANISH  ] ARMY STAFF GENERAL COLL// <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Also on September 18 , the Ambassador thanked General [PER Fulgencio Coll  ] for [LOC Spain  ] 's contributions to overseas deployments in [LOC Lebanon  ] , [LOC Kosovo  ] , [LOC Bosnia  ] , and [LOC Afghanistan  ] and sought [PER Coll  ] 's views on the possibility of lifting the cap of 3,000 on [MISC Spanish  ] overseas deployments . 
General [PER Coll  ] was very warm and engaging and seemed pleased the Ambassador was making the call . 
Prior to his July 18 appointment ( ref A ) , [PER Coll  ] had carried out two of this Socialist Government 's most significant military decisions ) the withdrawal from [LOC Iraq  ] in 2004 and the establishment of the [ORG Emergency Military Unit  ] ( [ORG UME  ] , or [ORG Unidad Militar de Emergencia  ] ) in 2006 . 
GEN [PER Coll  ] was born in [LOC Palma de Mallorca  ] and comes from a distinguished [MISC Balearic  ] military and political family . 
His father , [PER Fulgencio Coll  ] de [PER San Simon  ] , was also a general in the [MISC Spanish  ] Army and former President of [LOC Provincial Deputation  ] , as well as Civil Governor of [LOC Bilbao  ] in the 1970s . 
GEN [PER Coll  ] entered the [MISC Spanish  ] military academy in 1966 and graduated as an infantry branch lieutenant in 1970 . 
Unlike other [MISC Spanish  ] general officers , he has spent long periods of time in troop units and especially in command positions as a senior officer. //CHIEF OF [MISC SPANISH  ] [ORG AIR FORCE  ] STAFF GENERAL JIMENEZ// <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The new head of the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG Air Force  ] , General [PER Jose Jimenez Ruiz  ] , also warmly received Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] on September 25 , just hours before the reception in his honor . 
During the 30-minute call , followed by a tour of [ORG Air Force  ] headquarters , General [PER Jimenez  ] spoke openly about his family . 
The Ambassador reiterated to [PER Jimenez  ] his thanks for [LOC Spain  ] 's contributions to overseas deployments . 
Until May 2008 , [PER Jimenez  ] had served as the commander of the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG Air Forces  ] in the [LOC Canary Islands  ] ( ref A ) . 
He was a surprise pick for the top [ORG Air Force  ] job , advancing from being a soon-to-retire 2-star general to a four-star Chief virtually overnight . 
According to [ORG DAO  ] sources , he was considering retirement from the Canaries in May , when he was told by someone in the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] not to submit his paperwork . 
Within the month , he had received a promotion to Lieutenant General , a fact unknown to then-Air [ORG Force  ] Chief of Staff , General [PER Garcia de la Vega  ] . 
When the Minister of [ORG Defense  ] replaced the Chief of [ORG Defense  ] and all three service chiefs in July , General [PER Jimenez  ] was given a fourth star and named [ORG Air Force  ] Chief of [MISC Staff.  ] //Comment// <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) We enjoyed a very close relationship with the previous [ORG CHOD  ] and service chiefs . 
The initial encounters with their replacements suggest that excellent working relationship is going to continue . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] military is highly disciplined to its civilian leadership , but it is worth remembering that whatever our differences with [MISC Spanish  ] politicians , the armed forces are always well-disposed to work with the [LOC U.S.  ] , both bilaterally and the context of [ORG NATO  ] . 
The agreement to host the Flintlock exercise , obtained on very short notice when events in [LOC Mauritania  ] made that venue inadvisable , is important in and of itself , but it is also a symbol of how healthy the military-to-military relationship is .
