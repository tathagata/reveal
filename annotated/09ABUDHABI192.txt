( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary: [LOC UAE  ] Chief of Staff of the [ORG Armed Forces  ] convoked the Ambassador to request the urgent deployment of five [LOC U.S.  ] patriot batteries in the [LOC UAE  ] as an interim measure until the [LOC UAE  ] 's own batteries are operational ( anticipated in 2012 ) . 
The [LOC UAE  ] belief that an increasingly likely pre-emptive [MISC Israeli  ] attack on [LOC Iran  ] would prompt quick retaliation on [LOC U.S.  ] allies ( foremost among them the very proximate [LOC UAE  ] ) prompted the request . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On 22 February 2009 , Ambassador [PER Richard Olson  ] , [ORG Defense Attache  ] ( [ORG DATT  ] ) Colonel [PER Bret Rider  ] and Chief , [ORG US Liaison Office  ] ( [ORG USLO  ] ) Colonel [PER David Sprague  ] were summoned to the office of the Chief of Staff of the [ORG UAE Armed Forces  ] ( [ORG COS  ] ) , where they were met by the [ORG COS  ] , LTG [PER Hamid Thani  ] al [PER Rumaithy  ] , Director Military Intelligence and Security ( [ORG MISS  ] ) [PER MGen Eissa  ] al [MISC Mazrouei  ] , Commander of the [ORG UAE Air Force  ] and [ORG Air Defence  ] ( [ORG AF&AD  ] ) AVM [PER Mohammed Swaidan  ] al [PER Qamzi  ] and the COSs office director [PER BGen Faris Mohammed  ] al [PER Mazroui.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) Following very brief pleasantries the [ORG COS  ] bluntly commented: " I need to be open and frank with you , there are changes in the region that concern us . 
" On behalf of his government , the [ORG COS  ] then made an official request of the [LOC US  ] government to deploy between four and five [MISC Patriot  ] batteries to the [LOC UAE  ] during calendar year 2009 . 
He requested these batteries remain in place until such time as they can be replaced by the [LOC UAE  ] 's own nine batteries , currently on order. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [LOC UAE  ] would place three of the [LOC US  ] batteries in and around [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] , one battery at the port of [LOC Jebel Ali  ] , and a final battery somewhere else in the northern emirates ( presumably [LOC Dubai  ] ) . 
The [ORG COS  ] noted previous studies on the placement of the batteries are on file and will help guide final placement . 
The [ORG COS  ] stated the batteries would be used to protect critical military and civilian targets. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [ORG COS  ] noted that [LOC Iran  ] will continue doing its best to keep the entire region unstable . 
[LOC Iran  ] is recognized as [LOC Israel  ] 's biggest threat in the region and [LOC Israel  ] will attack [LOC Iran  ] with little or no notice . 
Following an [MISC Israeli  ] attack , the [LOC UAE  ] is convinced [LOC Iran  ] will lash out against those who " help [LOC Israel  ] , " or the allies of [LOC Israel  ] 's friends , most significantly the [LOC UAE  ] . 
The [ORG COS  ] noted the [LOC UAE  ] has the [MISC Patriot  ] system on order and expects to take delivery in 2012 . 
He went on to mention the pending deployment of a single [MISC Patriot  ] battery to protect [ORG Al Dhafra Air Base  ] -- which should be operational within the next 30 to 60 days . 
The [ORG COS  ] noted the [LOC UAE  ] operational capacity will come too late and the single [LOC US  ] battery will be too little to stop [MISC Iranian  ] missiles if they attack sooner rather than later. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Hamid Thani  ] senses indications and warnings the [MISC Israeli  ] government now being formed will likely attack [LOC Iran  ] . 
He thinks the new ( [PER Netanyahu  ] ) government will be very determined to eliminate the threat of [MISC Iranian  ] missiles , especially nuclear tipped ones , which they fear may come raining down on [MISC Israeli  ] cities . 
He also stated [LOC Israel  ] would be justified to take such action as it must protect its citizens just as any nation has the duty to do . 
He feels that a breakthrough in international efforts in regard to [LOC Iran  ] 's armament programs may slow [LOC Israel  ] 's actions . 
However , the [ORG COS  ] knows that [LOC Israel  ] must maintain all its options . 
He also knows the [MISC Iranians  ] have toyed with the international community for over ten years as they built their capability . 
He stated the [MISC Israelis  ] are also very aware of [MISC Iranian  ] tactics. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) When pressed on what type of event may precipitate an [MISC Israeli  ] attack , the [ORG COS  ] thought the delivery of the [MISC Russian  ] S-300 system could be the catalyst . 
The [ORG COS  ] stated very flatly that " I don't trust the [MISC Russians  ] , I 've never trusted the [MISC Russians  ] or the [MISC Iranians  ] . 
" <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [ORG COS  ] went on to request continued and expanded intelligence sharing between the [LOC US  ] and the [LOC UAE  ] . 
He asked the [ORG DATT  ] what advance warning the [LOC US  ] could expect of an [MISC Iranian  ] attack . 
He quickly added that he asks the same question of his [ORG MISS  ] chief at least twice a week and gets no answer -- as he knows there is no good answer . 
( [ORG Note:  ] The [ORG COS  ] served as the [ORG MISS  ] chief prior to becoming [ORG COS  ] and knows very well the capabilities related to predicting [MISC Iranian  ] actions . 
End note . 
) <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The meeting ended nearly as quickly as it began with both sides wishing each other good will and great success during the [MISC International Defense Exhibition  ] ( [ORG IDEX  ] ) opening later in the day ( immediately following this meeting all of the attendees departed directly for [ORG IDEX  ] ) . 
The [ORG COS  ] met with and most certainly briefed the President , Prime Minister and [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] Crown Prince ( the de facto Minister of [ORG Defense  ] ) as [ORG IDEX  ] began .
