( U ) This is a joint Political and [ORG Economic Section  ] cable. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) Summary . 
[LOC Italy  ] 's relationship with [LOC Russia  ] is complex , encompassing historical ideological sympathies , geostrategic calculations , commercial pressure , energy dependence , and personal relationships between top leaders . 
The combination of these factors creates a strong tendency for [LOC Italy  ] 's foreign policy to be highly receptive to [MISC Russian  ] efforts to gain greater political influence in the [ORG EU  ] and to support [LOC Russia  ] 's efforts to dilute [MISC American  ] security interests in [LOC Europe  ] . 
In its relationship with [LOC Russia  ] , energy is the most important bilateral issue and the quest for stable energy supplies from [LOC Russia  ] frequently forces [LOC Italy  ] to compromise on security and political issues . 
A not insignificant concomitant factor is PM [PER Berlusconi  ] 's desire to be seen as an important [MISC European  ] player on foreign policy , leading him to go where others dare not . 
End summary . 
Roots of [MISC Italian  ] Russophilia: Ideology on the Left , a [ORG Long-Standing Market Opportunity  ] on the Right - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) Until the 2008 parliamentary elections , the [MISC Italian  ] Communist party and various leftist splinter groups were a permanent fixture of the [MISC Italian  ] political scene . 
Throughout the [MISC Cold War  ] members of the [MISC Italian  ] communist movement maintained close ties with the [LOC Soviet Union  ] , other communist countries , and many communist revolutionary movements . 
Unlike many other communist parties around the world , the [MISC Italian  ] communist movement remained unapologetic in its continued belief in [LOC Marxism-Leninism  ] as a viable economic alternative to capitalism . 
While many [MISC European  ] leftist intellectuals recognize that -- aside from an authoritarian approach to governing - - [PER Putin  ] 's [LOC Russia  ] bears little resemblance to Communist ideals , this fact has not deterred [MISC Italian  ] communists and other radical left politicians from being openly pro-Russia on the basis of ideological solidarity . 
This , combined with the advanced average age o most high-level [MISC Italian  ] politicians ( 65-70 ) , prevents many in the far left of [LOC Italy  ] 's political spectrum from moving beyond a worldview developed ( and apparently frozen ) during the [MISC Cold War.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) Throughout the [MISC Cold War  ] , [MISC Italian  ] business interests frequently skirted the line of what was appropriate in their pursuit of the [MISC Soviet  ] market . 
After the collapse of the [LOC Soviet Union  ] , the explosion of consumer wealth in [LOC Russia  ] created massive deman for high-end and luxury [MISC Italian  ] exports . 
From 1998 to 2007 [MISC Italian  ] exports to [LOC Russia  ] grew by 230 percent , from 2.7 billion Euros to 9.5 Billion . 
Many of [LOC Italy  ] 's leading businessmen began to see [LOC Russia  ] as a limitless market that could substitute for loss of export revenue from other parts of the world . 
These businessmen maintain strong ties to the pro-business , free-market-oriented politicians on the right , including the most visible patron of [LOC Italy  ] 's business elite: PM [PER Silvio Berlusconi  ] . 
[PER Putin  ] Most Influential Figure in [LOC Italy  ] 's [LOC Russia  ] Policy - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) While [LOC Italy  ] 's political parties , the [ORG MFA  ] and [ORG ENI  ] exert some influence on [LOC Italy  ] 's [LOC Russia  ] policy , by far the most importan factor is the personal attention [PER Putin  ] devotes to the relationship . 
By our reckoning , [PER Putin  ] has held more bilateral meetings with sitting [MISC Italian  ] PMs in the recent past than any other world leader . 
He was the first world leader to meet with [PER Berlusconi  ] after the 2008 elections , arriving in [LOC Sardegna  ] to visit the PM designate before the latter had even been sworn in . 
[PER Berlusconi  ] believes that [PER Putin  ] is his close and personal friend and continues to have more contact with [PER Putin  ] than with any other world leader . 
During the [MISC Georgi  ] crisis , [PER Berlusconi  ] spoke to [PER Putin  ] on a daily basis for a period of almost a week . 
The basis of the friendship is hard to determine , but many interlocutors have told us that [PER Berlusconi  ] believes that [PER Putin  ] , a fellow 'tycoon' , trusts [PER Berlusconi  ] more than other [MISC European  ] leader . 
( A contact in the PM 's office told us that their frequent meetings are accompanied by exchanges of lavish gifts ) . 
[PER Berlusconi  ] admires [PER Putin  ] 's macho , decisive , and authoritarian governing style , which the [MISC Italian  ] PM believes matches his own . 
From the [MISC Russian  ] side , it appears that [PER Putin  ] has devoted much energy to developing [PER Berlusconi  ] 's trust. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S/NF ) Contacts in both the opposition center-left [ORG PD Rome  ] 00000097 002 of 005 party and [PER Berlusconi  ] 's own [ORG PdL  ] party , however , have hinted at a more nefarious connection . 
They believe that [PER Berlusconi  ] and his cronies are profiting personally and handsomely from many of the energy deals between [LOC Italy  ] and [LOC Russia  ] . 
The [MISC Georgian  ] ambassador in [LOC Rome  ] has told us that the [ORG GOG  ] believes [PER Putin  ] has promised [PER Berlusconi  ] a percentage of profits from any pipelines developed by [ORG Gazprom  ] in coordination with [ORG ENI  ] . 
Whenever we raise the issue of [LOC Russia  ] and the P with our contacts in [ORG PdL  ] , [PER Berlusconi  ] 's own party , they have usually pointed us to [PER Valentino Valentini  ] , a member of parliament and somewhat shadowy figure who operates as Berluscon 's key man on [LOC Russia  ] , albeit with no staff or even a secretary . 
[PER Valentini  ] , a [MISC Russian-speaker  ] who travels to [LOC Russia  ] several times per month , frequently appears at [PER Berlusconi  ] 's side when he meets other world leaders . 
What he does in [LOC Moscow  ] during his frequent visits is unclear but he is widely rumored to be looking after [PER Berlusconi  ] 's business interests in [LOC Russia  ] . 
Our contacts uniformly deem [PER Valentini  ] , a multilingual former interpreter , close to [PER Berlusconi  ] with regard to [LOC Russia  ] , but not a polic person. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) All of our interlocutors - xxxxxxxxxxxx - report that [PER Berlusconi  ] determines [LOC Italy  ] 's policy on [LOC Russia  ] single-handedly , neither seeking nor accepting counsel . 
Virtually all are reluctant to confront the PM even when he is at his worst on [LOC Russia  ] . 
In November 2008 , after a disastrous press conference in which , inter alia , the PM described [ORG NATO  ] expansion , recognition of [LOC Kosovo  ] 's independence , and missile defense as " [LOC U.S.  ] provocations " of [LOC Russia  ] , [ORG GOI  ] officials did a classic duck- and-cover . 
In response to our objections , [ORG MFA  ] and PM staff sheepishly directed us to the PM himself , rather than deliver the unpleasant news to him that he had angered not only the [MISC Americans  ] but other members of the [ORG Contact Group  ] for the [LOC Balkans  ] , not t mention the [MISC Czechs  ] and [MISC Poles  ] . 
Even FM [PER Frattini  ] admits to wielding no influence on [PER Berlusconi  ] on [LOC Russia  ] . 
During an early September visit to [LOC Italy  ] , former VP [PER Cheney  ] confronted [PER Frattini  ] on [LOC Italy  ] 's very public and unhelpful stance on the [LOC Georgia  ] conflict . 
A subdued [PER Frattini  ] noted that , while he had strong opinions on the issue , he nevertheless received his marching orders from the [ORG PM.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C/NF ) Distressingly , [PER Berlusconi  ] treats [LOC Russia  ] policy as he does his domestic political affairs - tactically and day-to-day . 
His overwhelming desire is to remain in [PER Putin  ] 's good graces , and he has frequently voiced opinions and declarations that have been passed to him directly by [PER Putin  ] . 
One such example: in the aftermath of the [LOC Georgia  ] crisis , [PER Berlusconi  ] began ( and continues ) to insist that [LOC Georgia  ] was the aggressor and that the [ORG GOG  ] was responsible for several hundred civilian deaths in [LOC South Ossetia  ] . 
No [LOC Institutional Leadership  ] on [LOC Russia  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) Trying to determine who might have some influence on [PER Berlusconi  ] 's [LOC Russia  ] policy is not an easy task . 
One thing is certain , however - it is not the foreign policy institutions of the [ORG GOI  ] . 
FM [PER Frattini  ] is widely seen as only the messenger for PM [PER Berlusconi  ] 's [LOC Russia  ] policy - indeed he termed himself as much to VP [PER Cheney  ] during the latter 's September 2008 visit to [LOC Rome  ] . 
Within the professional ranks , resources and expertise are scant . 
[LOC Italy  ] 's [ORG MFA  ] contains only one full-time diplomat assigned to cover [LOC Russia  ] and the countries of the former [MISC Soviet  ] Union: the [ORG Office Director  ] . 
The Deputy [ORG Office Director  ] position and single Desk Officer position assigned to cover all the countries of the [ORG FSU  ] are vacant . 
[LOC Italy  ] 's dire budget situation is likely to prevent the hiring of additional staff at the [ORG MFA  ] for at least two years , according to one [MISC MF  ] source . 
The [ORG Office Director  ] 's direct supervisor - the A/S equivalent - is also responsible for the [LOC Balkans  ] and the rest of [LOC Europe  ] , but she , like [PER Frattini  ] , appears to have little or no input to [LOC GOI Russia  ] policy . 
The PM 's staff does not fare much better . 
The [ORG Office of the Diplomatic Advisor  ] is thinly staffed - with only one officer assigned to each geographic region . 
The position covering [LOC Russia  ] is staffed by a midlevel diplomat who is in the process of being transferred . 
No replacement is likely to be named . 
As a result , the officer covering the [LOC Middle East  ] ( also the deputy for the office ) will be forced to take on those duties in addition to his already overwhelming portfolio and management duties. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C/NF ) In 2008 the [ORG MFA  ] undertook an effort to produce a long-term foreign policy strategy for the [ORG GOI  ] . 
In a paper entitled " Rapporto 2020 " the [ORG MFA  ] outlined its strategic vision for the next decade and a half . 
The document notes that geostrategic realities have created the need for [LOC Italy  ] to adapt its foreign policy with regard to [LOC Russia  ] and calls for [LOC Italy  ] to seek 'a privileged relationship' with [LOC Moscow  ] in order to press its overwhelmingly preeminent bilateral concern: energy . 
[LOC Rome  ] 00000097 003 of 005 Energy Becomes Key Bilateral Issue - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C/NF ) With virtually no domestic energy reserves , no domestic nuclear power , and an ambitious parastatal energy company , [LOC Italy  ] 's key bilateral concern with [LOC Russia  ] has become the quest for long-term guarantees of energy supplies . 
The [ORG GOI  ] has supported [ORG ENI  ] and other energy giants' efforts to create a unique partnership with [LOC Russia  ] and [ORG Gazprom  ] for long-term cooperation . 
[ORG ENI  ] , [LOC Italy  ] 's most prominent energy parastatal , wields immense political power ; its business strategy has focused on complicated geopolitical environments generally perceived as overly risky by many of its international competitors . 
[ORG ENI  ] 's lobbying efforts vis- ( -vis the [ORG GOI  ] are better funded than most government offices . 
It hosts one diplomatic advisor assigned from the [ORG MFA  ] . 
Going by press reports alone , we would judge that PM [PER Berlusconi  ] grants its director , [PER Paolo Scaroni  ] , as much access as he does his own FM.xxxxxxxxxxxx . 
Members of political parties on both sides of the aisle have told us that [ORG ENI  ] is one of the leading financial contributors to [LOC Italy  ] 's many think-tanks - many of which produce public diplomacy discussions and events on the importance of [MISC Italy-Russia  ] relations . 
At one such event in 2007 , a conference on [LOC Central Asia  ] , representatives from [ORG ENI  ] and [PER Edison  ] were given 30 minutes each to speak , while the four Foreign Ministers and Deputy Foreign Minister of five [MISC Central Asian  ] former [MISC Soviet  ] states were all crammed into a single hour . 
There is even suspicion that [ORG ENI  ] maintains journalists on its payroll. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C/NF ) Members of political parties from both sides of the aisle have told us that [ORG ENI  ] does not limit its dialogue with the government to energy issues . 
One member of the opposition center-left [ORG PD  ] party told poloffs that [ORG ENI  ] 's presence in [LOC Russia  ] exceeds that of [LOC Italy  ] 's understaffed embassy . 
While it is unclear how much policy coordination occurs between [ORG ENI  ] and the [MISC Russian  ] political structure , the same [ORG PD  ] party members noted that [ORG ENI  ] had as much contact with [MISC Russian  ] political and economic leaders as the embassy , if not more , and political messages were frequently passed through such commercial/economic channels . 
Back in [LOC Rome  ] , [ORG ENI  ] maintains strong contacts with members of the [MISC Italian  ] parliament - something the [ORG MFA  ] does not do ( apart from requested briefings to members of the foreign affairs committees ) . 
An Energy Policy without the Policy - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C/NF ) [ORG ENI  ] and other energy giants have managed to press their case quite effectively within the highest ranks of the [ORG GOI  ] . 
[MISC Italian  ] leaders on both sides of the aisle seem strangely unconcerned about dependence on [MISC Russian  ] energy . 
They point out that [LOC Italy  ] depended on [MISC Russian  ] coal during the darkest days of the [MISC Cold War  ] with n dire consequence . 
[MISC Italians  ] are also lulled into complacency by the fact that geographic proximity to [MISC North African  ] resources means that they are far less dependent on [LOC Russia  ] than are the [MISC Germans  ] or the former [MISC Eastern  ] bloc countries. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C/NF ) During a March 2008 visit to [ORG ENI Headquarters  ] embassy staff were given a briefing on [ORG ENI  ] 's [MISC Russian  ] energy operations ( available on Embassy [LOC Rome  ] 's Classified web site ) . 
[ORG ENI  ] 's view of the [MISC European  ] energy situation was disturbingly similar to that of [ORG GAZPROM  ] and the [LOC Kremlin  ] , and at times laced with rhetorical flourishes reminiscent of [MISC Soviet-era  ] double-speak: according to [ORG ENI  ] , the real threat to [LOC Western Europe  ] 's energy security is not [LOC Russia  ] -- it is [LOC Ukraine  ] . 
The real solution to [LOC Europe  ] 's energy insecurity , according to [ORG ENI  ] , lies in more direct pipeline connections to [MISC Russian  ] gas fields and a need for pipelines that do not go through [LOC Ukraine  ] - the rationale for the [LOC South Stream  ] and [ORG Nord Stream  ] pipelines ( ref b ) . 
[ORG ENI  ] 's engineering arm hopes to construct both pipelines using experience gained in the construction of the [ORG Blue Stream  ] pipeline that connects [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC Turkey  ] under the [MISC Eastern  ] portion of the [LOC Black Sea  ] . 
Additionally , [ORG ENI  ] seeks full partnership with [LOC Russia  ] on the [LOC South Stream  ] project . 
[ORG GOI  ] and [ORG ENI  ] contacts have reported that the company was having trouble getting a firm [MISC Russian  ] commitment to this [LOC South Stream  ] partnership . 
The plummeting price of hydrocarbons may have reduced the economic incentives for this project , but many analysts believe that [MISC Russian  ] geo-strategic concerns will trump business considerations on this project . 
The most recent [LOC Russia- Ukraine  ] gas dispute seems to have revived interest in the [ORG Nord Stream  ] and [LOC South Stream  ] projects , especially among those who see [LOC Ukraine  ] as the problem . 
[LOC Rome  ] 00000097 004 of 005 <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C/NF ) [LOC Italy  ] is not totally blind to the dangers of its dependence on [LOC Russia  ] , however , and it is taking some steps that may prevent an increase in the percentage of their energy that they get from [LOC Russia  ] . 
Upon returning to power , [PER Berlusconi  ] announced that he would return the country to nuclear power . 
While the [ORG GOI  ] seems serious , this project will require eye-popping expenditures , long- term commitment , and the resolution of thorny environmental problems . 
Some fear that the nuclear project was launched in response to an oil price of $140 per barrel , and wonder if the [MISC Italian  ] commitment to nuclear power will recede if oil prices stay low . 
[LOC Italy  ] is also increasing its use of [ORG Liquid Natural Gas  ] and is finishing work on a new terminal in the [LOC Northern Adriatic  ] . 
While less-than-enthusiastic about the [ORG EU  ] 's complex [ORG Nabucco  ] pipeline , the [ORG GOI  ] seems to be supporting the smaller-scale Turkey-Greece-Italy pipeline project designed to bring [MISC Caspian  ] gas to [LOC Western Europe  ] . 
[PER Edison  ] , a [MISC French  ] company with [MISC Italian  ] roots , is trying to determine if it should commit to this project . 
While [MISC Azeri  ] gas supplies and [LOC Turkey  ] 's willingness to allow the gas to flow [LOC West  ] are unresolved issues , [PER Edison  ] believes its project has a chance of succeeding because unlike [ORG Nabucco  ] , it is small enough -- it believes -- not to provoke opposition from [LOC Russia  ] . 
The [ORG GOI  ] -- especially powerful Minister for [ORG Economic Development Scajola  ] -- supports the TGI project ( in fact [ORG GOI  ] officials complain if the [LOC U.S.  ] sometimes seems to imply that [ORG Nabucco  ] should have priority ) . 
There is fear that a successful launch of [LOC South Stream  ] would -- by promising to meet demand -- doom both [LOC South Stream  ] and [ORG Nabucco  ] . 
A Foreign Policy Designed to Deny [LOC Russia  ] Nothing - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C/NF ) The combination of historical ideological sympathy , energy dependence , lack of institutional influence , and a close personal relationship between [PER Berlusconi  ] and [PER Putin  ] serve to provide [LOC Russia  ] with an apparently trusted ally , overtly willing to work overtime within the [ORG EU  ] on [LOC Moscow  ] 's behalf . 
[LOC Russia  ] can count on [LOC Italy  ] to support its efforts to remove irritants in its relations with the [LOC West  ] , including: - pressure on/within [ORG OSCE  ] to overlook [LOC Russia  ] 's lack of compliance with its legally binding [LOC Istanbul  ] commitments on frozen conflicts , - weak support or even opposition to [ORG NATO  ] efforts to build closer ties to [LOC Georgia  ] and [LOC Ukraine  ] , - weak initial support for international efforts to recognize [LOC Kosovo  ] 's independence , - unhelpful comments on [LOC U.S.  ] bilateral [ORG Missile Defense  ] plans with [LOC Poland  ] and [LOC Czech Republic  ] , - support for [MISC Russian  ] President [PER Medvedev  ] 's plans to redefine [MISC European  ] security architecture to undermine [ORG OSCE  ] and NATO. - support for [MISC Russian  ] efforts to undermine [ORG EU  ] and [LOC US  ] energy security initiatives for [LOC Europe.  ] <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C/NF ) In the past , [PER Berlusconi  ] 's highly-prized personal relationship with [LOC U.S.  ] President [PER Bush  ] was an important counterweight to [MISC Russian  ] influence , but many pro-U.S . 
[MISC Italian  ] party officials on both sides of the aisle have worried to us that [PER Bush  ] 's departure could tempt [PER Berlusconi  ] to move closer to [LOC Russia  ] . 
For his part , [PER Berlusconi  ] has publicly stated that he would like to become a bridge between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia  ] and to " educate a young and inexperienced new [MISC American  ] president " on how to deal with the [MISC Russians  ] . 
If the past is any guide , this will likely mean an intensified effort to press the [MISC Russian  ] agenda with the [LOC U.S.  ] Mitigating the [MISC Problem: Pushing Back  ] on a [MISC Corrosive Influence  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C/NF ) To tackle the problem head-on , Post has deployed a robust diplomatic and public affairs strategy targeting key figures inside and outside government . 
Our aim is two-fold: educate our interlocutors more profoundly on [MISC Russian  ] activities and thus the context for [LOC U.S.  ] policy , as well as build a counter- weight of dissenting opinion on [LOC Russia  ] policy , especially within [PER Berlusconi  ] 's political party . 
. 
Since the beginning of the summer , wit [PER Berlusconi  ] 's return to power and the [LOC Georgia  ] crisis , we have been engaging with [ORG GOI  ] leaders aggressively at all levels . 
Pol , [LOC PA  ] and Econoffs have engaged party members , [ORG GOI  ] contacts , think tanks and even press to provide an alternative narrative to the [PER Berlusconi  ] insistence that [LOC Russia  ] is a democratic and stable country that has been provoked by the [LOC West  ] . 
The effort seems to be paying off . 
The opposition has begun taking jabs at [PER Berlusconi  ] by portraying him as choosing the wrong side of the debate . 
Some in the PdL have begun to approach us privately to say that they would like greater dialogue with us on the [LOC Russia  ] issue , and have indicated their [LOC Rome  ] 00000097 005 of 005 interest in challenging [PER Berlusconi  ] 's giddiness about [PER Putin  ] . 
While we have a long way to go in changing the narrative , unfortunately , we have help - in the form of a PM who appears increasingly to be the mouthpiece of [PER Putin  ] . 
Comment - - - - <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C/NF ) The bilateral relationship between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Italy  ] is excellent and encompasses tremendous cooperation on many levels and on many fronts . 
Unfortunately , [PER Berlusconi  ] efforts to " repair " the relationship between the [LOC West  ] and [LOC Russia  ] ( which as he told the Ambassador in their farewell meeting on February 23 , " sticks in my gut as a large undigested mass " ) are threatening his credibility and becoming a real irritant in our relationship . 
We can help get him back on the right track by sending him a clear signal that the [LOC U.S.  ] does not need an interlocutor for its important bilateral relationship with [LOC Russia  ] and that his insistence on undermining existin structures and channels based on common interests and shared values within the alliance in exchange for short term stability is not a strategy [LOC Washington  ] wishes to pursue .
