[ORG DUBAI  ] 00000316 001.2 OF 003 CLASSIFIED BY: [PER Timothy Richardson  ] , Acting Director , [ORG Iran Regional Presence Office  ] , [ORG Department of State  ] . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) This is a joint cable by the [ORG Iran Regional Presence Office  ] and the [ORG Dubai Regional Media Hub.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Summary: Since  ] [LOC Iran  ] 's June 12 presidential elections , [MISC Arab  ] media have intensely focused their coverage on the demonstrations in [LOC Iran  ] and the international community 's response to the government crackdown . 
Whereas in recent years the [MISC Arab  ] media have limited their commentary to [LOC Iran  ] 's external relations -- particularly its regional ambitions and the international implications of its nuclear program -- during the post-election crisis [MISC Arab  ] commentators have , for the first time , poked a hole in the veneer of the [LOC Islamic Republic  ] 's internal political system and explored its underpinnings more closely , often challenging the system 's very legitimacy in on-air commentary . 
A number of these commentators have opined that [PER Ahmadinejad  ] has , at least in the near term , lost standing among some moderate [MISC Arabs  ] , who have come to view [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's administration as oppressive , unpopular , and undemocratic , much as they criticize many [MISC Arab  ] governments . 
However , all of the [MISC Arab  ] media figures we spoke to emphasized that [MISC Arab  ] criticism of [PER Ahmadinejad  ] has not necessarily led to increased support for [LOC U.S.  ] policy in the region . 
On the contrary , closer analysis suggests that [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's eroding popularity in the [MISC Arab  ] world has created a scenario in which any [LOC U.S.  ] effort to engage the current [MISC Iranian  ] government will be perceived by a wide spectrum of [MISC Arabs  ] as accommodation with [PER Ahmadinejad  ] . 
ALL EYES ON [LOC IRAN  ] ---------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [LOC Iran  ] 's post-election crisis has dominated the [MISC Arab  ] media 's news coverage for the past seven weeks . 
The demonstrations have garnered special coverage on [LOC Al-Arabiya  ] and have consistently been among the top headlines on [LOC Al-Jazeera  ] . 
The marketing director of the [LOC Middle East Broadcasting Company  ] ( [ORG MBC  ] ) , parent company of [LOC Al-Arabiya  ] , told [MISC IRPO/DRMH  ] that [LOC Al-Arabiya  ] 's viewership has skyrocketed since the June 12 election . 
[LOC Al-Arabiya  ] 's news website has also experienced a dramatic increase in visits from users living in the region between [LOC Tripoli  ] and [LOC Amman  ] , which the marketing director , a native of [LOC Lebanon  ] , attributed to the tremendous interest [PER Sunni Arabs  ] have in watching the drama in [LOC Iran  ] unfold . 
Coverage of [LOC Iran  ] 's election aftermath is not limited to straightforward news reporting ; editorial pages , media commentaries , and the [MISC Arab  ] blogosphere have also been abuzz with debate over the demonstrations , the international community 's response , and the implications of these events for the [MISC Arab  ] world . 
While [LOC Iran  ] 's elections may no longer command daily headlines in the [MISC Western  ] media , nearly all the [MISC Arab  ] media commentators with whom we spoke recognized that the [MISC Arab  ] street remains firmly focused on the recent unrest and continuing political drama playing out in [LOC Iran  ] . 
THE BENEVOLENT DICTATOR'S FALL FROM GRACE ? ------------------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) A [MISC Syrian  ] journalist and blogger , who owns a media consultancy firm in [LOC Dubai  ] , believes that many in the [MISC Arab  ] street initially viewed [PER Ahmadinejad  ] when he came to power in 2005 as a " benevolent dictator . 
" Citing the tradition of the [MISC Mahdi  ] , the media consultant argued that both [LOC Shi'a  ] and [MISC Sunni Arabs  ] are taught from early childhood to await the arrival of a strong and unimpeachable figure who will lead the [MISC Muslim  ] world . 
The media consultant maintained that even secular [MISC Arabs  ] view the world , albeit unintentionally , with this ingrained mindset . 
Our contact argued that [PER Ahmadinejad  ] played in to this narrative , and when [PER Ahmadinejad  ] arrived on the international stage many [MISC Arabs  ] saw him , in contrast to their own flawed leaders , as a humble and pious man who was brave enough to stand up for his people and the greater [MISC Muslim  ] world by confronting [LOC Israel  ] and the [LOC West  ] head on . 
However , both the intensely competitive campaign period and the forceful reaction by the [MISC Iranian  ] people to the official election results have led some moderate [MISC Arabs  ] to rethink [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's true disposition . 
The election , the media consultant said , led some [MISC Arabs  ] to understand that despite his astutely crafted and well-marketed image in the [MISC Arab  ] world , [ORG DUBAI  ] 00000316 002.2 OF 003 [PER Ahmadinejad  ] is resented by many [MISC Iranians  ] for domestic mismanagement , incompetence , and corruption . 
Because of this public fall from grace , so the media consultant told us , [PER Ahmadinejad  ] is no longer the " untouchable , holy figure " in the [MISC Arab  ] world he once was -- his flaws have brought him down to the level of the [MISC Arab  ] world 's own imperfect leaders . 
An [LOC Al-Arabiya  ] executive , speaking at a recent conference , said that the election aftermath had destroyed the image many [MISC Arabs  ] had of the [LOC Islamic Revolution  ] , and [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's legitimacy as a leader was now open to question . 
[ NOTE: The media consultant attributed [LOC Iran  ] 's perceived " victories " over the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [LOC West  ] to [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , as opposed to Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] . 
While conventional wisdom in the [LOC West  ] is that [PER Khamenei  ] has the final say over [LOC Iran  ] 's most vital interests , including the nuclear program , the consultant 's comments suggest that the [MISC Arab  ] street views [PER Ahmadinejad  ] as much more influential in the [LOC Islamic Republic  ] 's decision-making system . 
] POST-ELECTION CRISIS NOT A SILVER BULLET FOR [MISC ARAB  ] REGIMES --------------------------------------------- ------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's fall from grace notwithstanding , most of the [MISC Arab  ] media commentators with whom we spoke agreed that [MISC Arab  ] governments have a limited ability to capitalize on [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's missteps because of the skeletons in their own closets . 
[LOC Al-Arabiya  ] 's former [LOC Tehran  ] bureau chief observed that [MISC Arab  ] regional powers like [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] and [LOC Egypt  ] , who no doubt would like to exploit [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's current vulnerabilities , have remained noticeably silent . 
In his view , they realize that any statement condemning [LOC Tehran  ] 's crackdown on peaceful dissidents would appear untenably hypocritical in the eyes of their own citizens . 
He considers this public silence yet another " missed opportunity " for [MISC Arab  ] leaders to take a stand to counter [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's rhetoric and further detract from his popularity with the [MISC Arab  ] street . 
NEW SPACE TO DISAGREE WITH [PER AHMADINEJAD  ] AND THE [LOC U.S.  ] --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) All of the [MISC Arab  ] commentators and news media figures we spoke to agreed that the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" played it right " throughout the post-election crisis by staying away from detailed public comments that could be perceived as interventionist . 
However , the [MISC Arab  ] commentators were quick to distinguish between criticism of [PER Ahmadinejad  ] in the [MISC Arab  ] street and support for [LOC U.S.  ] policies . 
The [MISC Syrian  ] media consultant said that the heated debates before the election , in which the three challengers -- [ORG Mousavi  ] , [PER Karroubi  ] , and [PER Reza'i  ] -- publicly criticized [PER Ahmadinejad  ] for corruption and economic mismanagement , made it clear to [MISC Arabs  ] that this election was about [LOC Iran  ] , not the [LOC U.S.  ] This distinction , coupled with the [MISC U.S.'  ] restraint in commenting on the election , provided an unprecedented window for [MISC Arab  ] commentators to criticize [PER Ahmadinejad  ] without appearing to side with the [LOC U.S.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Examples of this played out during two separate appearances by the [ORG Dubai Regional Media Hub Acting  ] Director on live panel discussions on [ORG Abu Dhabi  ] TV and [MISC Lebanese  ] New TV regarding regional issues , including events in [LOC Iran  ] . 
Whereas fellow [MISC Arab  ] panelist resolutely disagreed with her comments in support of [LOC U.S.  ] policy in the region , in particular the peace process , they felt free to openly criticize [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's government , which they refrained from doing in the past , for its internal crackdown and regional ambitions . 
One [MISC Saudi  ] commentator contrasted [MISC Turkish  ] regional mediation , which he described as a positive force in the region , with [MISC Iranian  ] regional intervention , which he called pernicious and destabilizing . 
A [MISC Lebanese  ] commentator noted the irony of [LOC Iran  ] accusing outsiders of interfering in its internal affairs when there is not " one corner of the [MISC Arab  ] world " where [LOC Iran  ] does not intervene behind the scenes . 
[PER AHMADINEJAD  ] DOWN BUT NOT OUT [ORG DUBAI  ] 00000316 003.2 OF 003 ---------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) As [LOC Al-Arabiya  ] 's [LOC Tehran  ] bureau chief noted , while [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's image may have taken a hit in the [MISC Arab  ] street as a result of the government 's handling of domestic dissent , the damage is not necessarily permanent . 
In his view , the [MISC Arab  ] street is notoriously emotional and " could easily be turned to support [PER Ahmadinejad  ] once again " with some trumped up slogans and public bravado . 
The bureau chief believed that , in the perceived leadership void left by [MISC Arab  ] leaders on regional issues , [PER Ahmadinejad  ] could rally public opinion by capitalizing on any number of sensitive issues for the [MISC Arab  ] street , most prominent among them [LOC Israel  ] , at upcoming international fora . 
The [MISC Syrian  ] media consultant , too , cautioned the [LOC U.S.  ] not to overestimate any erosion in [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's popularity with [MISC Arabs  ] . 
In his opinion , [PER Ahmadinejad  ] has only lost standing with a segment of moderates in the [MISC Arab  ] street ; he believes that most [MISC Arabs  ] are so polarized , either for or against [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , that the allegations of voter fraud and the violent post-election crackdown on protesters will not permanently sway their positions one way or the other . 
ENGAGEMENT WITH IRAN: NO PLEASING THE [MISC ARAB  ] STREET --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Comment: Once the dust settles on [LOC Iran  ] 's post-election crisis , [MISC Arabs  ] will look to see if the [LOC U.S.  ] deals with [PER Ahmadinejad  ] as it pursues its nuclear nonproliferation agenda despite the lingering questions over the legitimacy of his election . 
If the [LOC U.S.  ] enters negotiations with [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's government , moderate [MISC Arab  ] observers may argue that the [LOC U.S.  ] , for the sake of its own national interest , has cut a deal at the expense of pro-democracy advocates -- just as many in the [MISC Arab  ] street believe the [LOC U.S.  ] has done with a number of [MISC Arab  ] regimes . 
Those [MISC Arabs  ] who continue to support [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , on the other hand , may perceive negotiations as a personal victory for a humble leader who brought the [LOC U.S.  ] to its knees through steadfast resistance . 
Thus , [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's " fall from grace " in the [MISC Arab  ] world may have created yet another obstacle to improved [MISC Arab  ] perceptions of the [LOC U.S.  ] -- in which engagement with an [MISC Ahmadinejad-led  ] government is now a potentially lose-lose scenario in which [MISC Arabs  ] at both ends of the pro- and anti-Ahmadinejad spectrum will consider negotiations with [MISC Teheran  ] an accommodation with the [MISC Iranian  ] president .
