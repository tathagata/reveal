End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG CDA  ] met with Permanent Secretary [PER Einar Gunnarsson  ] and [ORG Political Advisor  ] Kristjan [PER Guy Burgess  ] at the [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] on January 12 for a two hour marathon meeting to discuss [ORG Icesave  ] . 
The [MISC Icelandic  ] officials painted a very gloomy picture for [LOC Iceland  ] 's future . 
They suggested that the most likely outcome for the country was that the [ORG Icesave  ] issue would fail in a national referendum . 
Should that occur , they suggested , [LOC Iceland  ] would be back to square one with the [MISC British  ] and the [MISC Dutch  ] . 
The country , however , would be much worse off because it would have lost international credibility and access to financial markets . 
[PER Gunnarsson  ] suggested that the [ORG Icesave  ] issue , if it continues along its present course , would cause [LOC Iceland  ] to default in 2011 when a number of loans become due and could set [LOC Iceland  ] back 30 years. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The two government officials stressed that [LOC Iceland  ] needs international support . 
[ORG CDA  ] reiterated that the [LOC United States  ] was neutral on this bilateral issue and hoped for a speedy resolution . 
Moreover , the [LOC U.S.  ] had supported [LOC Iceland  ] 's position at the last [ORG IMF Review  ] and expected to do so again depending on the circumstances . 
[PER Gunnarsson  ] and [PER Burgess  ] responded that they understood the [LOC United States'  ] stated position of neutrality on the issue ; however , they expressed the view that it was impossible to remain neutral regarding the [ORG Icesave  ] matter . 
[LOC Iceland  ] , they said , was being bullied by two much larger powers and a position of neutrality was tantamount to watching the bullying take place . 
They suggested that a public statement from the [LOC U.S.  ] in support of [LOC Iceland  ] would be very helpful . 
They also felt that [LOC U.S.  ] intervention in the [ORG IMF  ] could be of assistance , specifically if it was targeted at getting [LOC Iceland  ] 's review placed on the [ORG IMF  ] agenda . 
[PER Gunnarsson  ] acknowledged that [LOC U.S.  ] support during the review was appreciated but , realistically , the issue would never make it on the agenda unless external pressure was applied on the [LOC IMF.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Gunnarsson  ] and [PER Burgess  ] were extremely pessimistic regarding the national referendum and said that the Government of [LOC Iceland  ] was exploring other options to resolve the [ORG Icesave  ] situation . 
They hinted that renegotiation might be a viable alternative and referenced recent meetings between the government and the opposition at which this option was discussed . 
Everyone could potentially save face , they suggested , if a new repayment agreement was reached with the [MISC British  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] that could possibly include a lower interest rate for the loan . 
This solution , they felt , would be palatable to the [MISC Icelandic  ] people and potentially to the opposition as well . 
They did not know , however , whether the [MISC British  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] would agree to another round of negotiations . 
They also acknowledged that any new agreement would have to be approved in parliament and , of course , signed by the president. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) On January 13 , [ORG CDA  ] also discussed the situation with [MISC British  ] Ambassador [PER Ian Whiting  ] who said that [LOC Britain  ] might consider options that would forestall a national referendum on the [ORG Icesave  ] issue . 
The Ambassador said , however , that the [MISC British  ] Government was receiving mixed messages from the Icelanders who , one week ago , seemed content to move forward with a referendum ( as the Prime Minister had conveyed to her [LOC UK  ] counterpart ) but now appeared to be looking at other options . 
For example , the [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] was already looking at ways to improve the agreement but not undermine the obligation or certainty of payment . 
He outlined for [ORG CDA  ] a potential solution that he was exploring that would involve [LOC Norway  ] loaning [LOC Iceland  ] the money to cover the [ORG Icesave  ] debt . 
This idea , he felt , had merit because it would create a situation in which the [MISC Icelandic  ] Government was dealing with [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000013 002 OF 002 a country that it perceived to be sympathetic to its situation , a fact that could remove some of the animosity from the renegotiations . 
Negotiating a good loan repayment agreement with [LOC Norway  ] , said [PER Whiting  ] , would allow both sides to claim victory . 
The [MISC British  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] would receive their money and [LOC Iceland  ] would be able to repay its debts under more favorable terms . 
He was going to discuss the idea with the [MISC Norwegian  ] Ambassador that same day. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) On January 13 , [ORG CDA  ] also met [LOC Iceland  ] 's Ambassador to the [LOC United States  ] [PER Hjalmar Hannesson  ] who was in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
The Ambassador described the potential constitutional crisis that would likely ensue should the referendum go forward and fail , in essence a vote of no confidence . 
In that case , the constitutionally apolitical Head of State would have brought down the elected government , a possibility that several former politicians in both parties had long ago agreed should not happen . 
Despite his and his family 's long association with the [ORG Progressive Party  ] , [PER Hannesson  ] said that this was not the time for elections or a change of government . 
He added that he did not sense a willingness on the part of the opposition to take control of the government . 
Noting that the President , whom he has known for years , is considered " unpredictable , " he hoped that a solution palatable to all sides in [LOC Iceland  ] could provide a way out. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Comment: It is quickly becoming clear that very few of the involved parties are comfortable with the [ORG Icesave  ] issue being put to a vote in a national referendum . 
Both the ruling coalition and the opposition appear to understand that they must present a united front for there to be any possibility of discussing alternative solutions with the [MISC British  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] . 
At present , such cooperation remains elusive ; however , a number of closed door meetings between the opposition and government will take place in the coming days to explore the full range of potential solutions and , hopefully , to forge consensus . 
All of this , however , remains in flux .
