REF B: [LOC LIMA  ] 3707 Classified By: NAS Director [PER Susan Keogh  ] . 
Reasons 1.4 ( d ) 1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY: The growing threat of narco-terrorism , reflected in the brutal attacks in [LOC Ocobamba  ] and [LOC Tajyacaja  ] ( Ref A ) , has sparked a public debate featuring demands that the Government take decisive action to tackle " liberated " zones . 
A factor complicating security operations has been confusion about whether the police or military have the lead , at a time when terrorism and narco-trafficking have increasingly merged into a single " narco-terrorist " threat . 
One noted analyst has made the case that the new narco-threat is much greater than [ORG Sendero Luminoso  ] ( [ORG SL  ] ) alone ever was . 
However the police-military riddle gets resolved , the debate shows [MISC Peruvians  ] increasingly recognize that no-go zones represent a threat to national security . 
In para 5 below is a brief description of the diverse groups involved in [LOC Peru  ] 's narco-terrorist network , many of them young , fueled by poverty and lured into illegal activities by the promise of escape . 
Government security forces have received additional budget support to address this challenge , but probably not enough ; likewise , their existing plans , lacking execution , may be unequal to the task . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In recent days , media comments and statements by government officials , triggered by the recent brutal attacks on police in [LOC Ocobamba  ] and [LOC Tayacaja  ] , have raised questions about the nature of the security threat in the emergency zones . 
Some believe the attacks suggest that [ORG Sendero Luminoso  ] may be resurging . 
Others say the problem is muddier , and consists of ex-army combatants , ronderos ( civil defense units ) , narco-cocaleros , and assorted others all participating in drug mafia violence. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The rub is that the identity of the perpetrators determines which security force has authority to respond , with the military taking the lead on terrorism and the [MISC Peruvian  ] [ORG National Police  ] ( [ORG PNP  ] ) on counter-narcotics . 
This arbitrary-seeming division is deeply entrenched , and has resulted in both sides pointing fingers at the other . 
It may also have shaped public perceptions concerning the government 's lack of will to address the problem . 
A recent national poll by IPSOS/APOYO shows 78 percent of [MISC Peruvians  ] think the [MISC GOP  ] is doing " little or nothing " to fight narco-terrorists . 
Notwithstanding recent security successes against [ORG SL  ] leader " [PER Comrade JL  ] " in the [LOC Huallaga Valley  ] ( Ref B ) , public skepticism remains high over the perceived lack of broader progress , particularly in tackling [ORG Sendero  ] in the [LOC Apurimac  ] and [PER Ene Valleys  ] ( [ORG VRAE  ] ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Former Minister of Interior and noted security analyst [PER Fernando Rospigliosi  ] has made the case that narco-trafficking is a national emergency " more dangerous than [ORG Sendero  ] ever was . 
" In his view , terrorism had political ideas that could be fought and defeated , whereas drug-trafficking has generated money and violence with unstoppable corruptive power . 
[PER Rospigliosi  ] does not believe [ORG Sendero  ] is growing , but believes that it has morphed into hired killers for narco-traffickers . 
Defense Minister [PER Wagner  ] has responded that the [ORG PNP  ] should take the lead role against narco-trafficking , but supports joint patrolling with the [ORG Army  ] in intelligence-based operations . 
Lack of personnel and 70,000 sq km of mountainous terrain in the [ORG VRAE  ] complicate the [ORG Army  ] 's task of capturing the [ORG SL  ] leadership . 
He reiterated a promise made in the past - that the state would be reinforcing its presence in the [ORG VRAE  ] with more [ORG Army  ] bases and Police stations. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Illustratively , at a recent meeting , Prime Minister [PER Jorge del Castillo  ] offered a catchall definition of who was involved in the [LOC Tayacaja  ] attack: " Subversion , linked with common crime and narco-trafficking , with the possibility of a violent resurgence of [ORG Sendero Luminoso  ] . 
" Below is more detail on the different groups who are -- either peripherally or directly -- involved in the narco-terrorism network in the [ORG VRAE  ] . 
The information below is based on credible reports from [ORG Narcotics Affairs Section  ] ( NAS ) field personnel , police intelligence and [ORG NGO  ] sources , who work in the [ORG VRAE  ] and have paid close attention to the growth of narco-related violence. -------------------- <a id='parA' href='#parA'>¶</a>A . 
[MISC Sendero Remnants  ] -------------------- [ORG PNP  ] sources estimate 350-400 [ORG Sendero  ] remnants continue to operate in the [ORG VRAE  ] , with a military structure based in the remote highlands of [LOC Vizcatan  ] , ( [LOC Northern Ayacucho  ] ) . 
The [ORG PNP  ] believes 5 [ORG SL  ] columns operate under the command of [PER Comrade Alipio  ] ( [PER Quispe  ] ) . 
Drug mafias pay [ORG SL  ] to protect mule-trains bringing drugs out of the [LOC Apurimac River Valley  ] . 
Services are paid in dollars , which [ORG SL  ] uses to obtain weapons , buy supplies , and pay members . 
[ORG SL  ] elements also seize weapons during ambushes such as the December 2005 attack on a [ORG PNP  ] convoy out of [LOC Palma Pampa  ] . 
Senderistas still disseminate ideological propaganda , assemble campesinos for indoctrination , and give out flags , as well as act as hired assassins for the drug industry . 
Increasingly , however , [ORG SL  ] acts as a narco-mafia , with its own cocaine production enterprise , ( in the view of many observers , including the Minister of Defense in one newspaper interview ) following the path of the [ORG FARC  ] and potentially headed for a takeover of the lucrative narcotics business in the [ORG VRAE  ] . 
( [PER Septel  ] we will seek to answer more broadly the question: " What does [ORG Sendero Luminoso  ] ( [ORG SL  ] ) mean today ? 
" ) ------------ <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
Ex-Army ------------ After the [LOC Ocobamba  ] attack , unconfirmed local media reports claimed that the perpetrators were ex-Army . 
Paramilitary clothing is usually worn during ambushes on the police or army: attackers steal uniforms along with arms . 
In August , a [ORG Pichari Army  ] NCO was captured by the [ORG PNP  ] with 9,000 rounds of 7.62 mm ammunition stolen from the base . 
When soldiers have completed voluntary service , having learned tactics and weapons use , but having earned little money , they are often drawn into the narco-trafficking network . 
A [ORG VRAE Army  ] commander reported to NAS seeing ex-soldiers who admitted they were protecting drug routes , acting as drug couriers ( " mochileros " ) , and working in rustic laboratories . 
The [ORG Army  ] has tended to adopt a non-interference strategy with cocalero farmers , said the same commander , to erode support the [ORG SL  ] might have among the local population ( i.e. eliminating coca will push growers onto the side of [ORG Sendero  ] ) . -------------------- <a id='parC' href='#parC'>¶</a>C . 
Narco-cocaleros -------------------- Cocaleros selling leaf to drug middlemen - acopiadors , - who come to the door and also collect coca paste for shipment by drug organizations , are relatively a thing of the past . 
Recent interdiction operations by [ORG DIRANDRO  ] drug police at [LOC Palma Pampa  ] have uncovered a surge in small rustic laboratories inside houses . 
Other cocalero groups rent larger equipped laboratories to drug producers . 
Mochileros are paid an average of 30 USD per kilo to transport cocaine base for journeys averaging 3 days to a specific location where they are replaced by pack animals or vehicles with armed guards . 
Mochileros are often robbed and killed . 
[ORG DIRANDRO  ] commanders have noted an increase in the presence of [MISC Mexican  ] and [MISC Colombian  ] drug cartels in the region since the first part of 2007 , working alongside [MISC Peruvian  ] drug groups. --------------------------------- <a id='parD' href='#parD'>¶</a>D . 
Civil Defense Units/Ronderos --------------------------------- [PER Ronderos  ] ( [LOC Comite de Auto  ] Defensa or CAD ) were established under President [PER Fujimori  ] to combat [ORG Sendero Luminoso  ] . 
They are organized , armed and controlled by the [ORG Army  ] . 
Although the [MISC GOP  ] prohibits the issue of automatic weapons , NAS personnel have seen , on at least one occasion , CAD formations carrying FAL 7.62mm automatic rifles during a visit to [ORG Pichari Army  ] base . 
[PER Ronderos  ] also purchase automatic weapons with money from drug traffickers . 
Entire communities of cocaleros are encouraged to cooperate with/join the [LOC Ronda  ] . 
Local sources estimate 40 CAD committees , with 40-60 men , operate in the [LOC Apurimac/Ene Valley  ] . 
[PER Ronderos  ] are occasionally involved in drug trafficking , and have used their arms against police forces during interdiction operations . 
CAD equipment , including weapons , radios and clothing , were captured by [ORG DIRANDRO  ] during a cocaine lab interdiction in [LOC Llochegua  ] in [LOC October.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The population of the [ORG VRAE  ] is largely young , poor and unemployed . 
The disaffected gravitate towards narco-trafficking as a source of income and activity . 
A local [ORG Army  ] commander told NAS that narco-terrorist groups recruit from remote communities in the [ORG VRAE  ] , preferring teenagers lured by the promise of pay . 
The recent police operation against [ORG Sendero  ] in [LOC Aucayacu  ] , ( [PER Huanaco  ] ) revealed that " [PER Comrade JL  ] " was accompanied by a group of adolescents , rather than a group of hardened terrorists . 
November 29 , [ORG Huanuco Regional  ] President [PER Jorge Espinoza  ] publicly called for government initiatives to counter [ORG SL  ] ideological inroads with local youth on the margins of society. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Government of [LOC Peru  ] has stepped forward with justifications for budgetary initiatives . 
On November 21 , the [ORG Interior  ] and Defense Ministers presented a joint request to [ORG Congress  ] for 400 million soles ( 133 million USD ) of increased funding to fight narco-terrorism in the [LOC Apurimac  ] and [PER Ene Valleys  ] . 
( [ORG Note: The Armed Forces  ] mainly want money to buy arms and refurbish bases . 
The Police particularly need ammunition , as well as arms and other equipment . 
End Note ) . 
Minister of [ORG Economy Carranza  ] authorized a supplement of only 50 million soles ( 16 million USD ) . 
The head of the [ORG Peruvian Joint Command  ] , [PER Adm. Montoya  ] , announced that the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] would construct 5 new anti-subversive bases in the [ORG VRAE  ] to add to the 18 already in the area . 
The Minister of [ORG Interior  ] also announced construction of new police bases in the [ORG VRAE  ] and [ORG Huallaga.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Comment: If one goal of narco-terrorists is to undermine public confidence in the security of the country , they have made some progress judging by the [MISC IPSOS/APOYO  ] poll . 
While the recent attacks on police have caused the usual polemics against corruption and incompetence on the part of the government , there is a deeper undercurrent of concern that narco-terrorism presents a serious menace to governability in [LOC Peru  ] . 
Most people concur that the [ORG VRAE  ] is a no-go zone , too dangerous to attempt eradication and development projects . 
Although Minister [PER Wagner  ] continues to support the concept of joint operations , to date , Plan [ORG VRAE  ] and other plans to improve social and economic conditions in the area appear to be stymied by the lack of an executable security plan . 
While interdiction operations continue out of the [ORG PNP  ] base at [LOC Palma Pampa  ] and joint PNP-EP operations have been occurring around the eradication operations in the [LOC Upper Huallaga  ] , to date , no joint [MISC Police-Army  ] CNT operations are being conducted in the [ORG VRAE  ] . 
Additionally , Police representatives have told us that the [ORG Armed Forces  ] and [ORG PNP  ] do not share intelligence they have collected on [ORG SL  ] in the Emergency Zones , indicating a lack of mutual trust .
