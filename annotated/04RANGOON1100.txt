<code><pre>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 [LOC RANGOON  ] 001100 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 08/26/2014 TAGS PARM , PINR , PREL , KNNP , BM , KN SUBJECT: ALLEGED NORTH KOREAN INVOLVEMENT IN MISSILE ASSEMBLY AND UNDERGROUND FACILITY CONSTRUCTION IN [MISC BURMA Classified  ] By: [ORG CDA  ] , A.I. [PER RON MCMULLEN  ] FOR REASON 1.5 ( [ORG A/C  ] ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) SUMMARY: [ORG North Korean  ] workers are reportedly assembling “SAM missiles” and constructing an underground facility at a [MISC Burmese  ] military site in [ORG Magway Division  ] , about 315 miles NNW of [LOC Rangoon  ] , according to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
This unsolicited account should not be taken as authoritative , but it tracks with other information garnered and reported via [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] some 300 [ORG North Koreans  ] are working at a secret construction site west of [LOC Mimbu  ] , [ORG Magway Division  ] , in the foothills of the [ORG Arakan Yoma  ] mountains . 
( Comment: the number of [ORG North Koreans  ] supposedly working at this site strikes us as improbably high . 
End comment . 
) The [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] claims he has personally seen some of them , although he also reported they are forbidden from leaving the construction site and that he and other “outsiders” are prohibited from entering . 
The [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was confident that [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] had the ability to distinguish [ORG North Koreans  ] from others , such as [MISC Chinese  ] , who might be working in the area . 
The exact coordinates of the camouflaged site are not known , but it is reportedly in the vicinity of 20,00 N , 94,25 E. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG North Koreans  ] are said to be assembling “SAM missiles” of unknown origin . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] the [ORG North Koreans  ] , aided by [MISC Burmese  ] workers , are constructing a concrete-reinforced underground facility that is “500 feet from the top of the cave to the top of the hill above.” He added that the [ORG North Koreans  ] are “blowing concrete” into the excavated underground facility. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] is supposedly engaged in constructing buildings for 20 [MISC Burmese  ] army battalions that will be posted near the site . 
Of these , two battalions are to be infantry ; the other 18 will be “artillery , ” according to this account. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) COMMENT: The [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] second-hand account of [ORG North Korean  ] involvement with missile assembly and military construction in [ORG Magway Division  ] generally tracks with other information Embassy [LOC Rangoon  ] and others have reported in various channels . 
Again , the number 300 is much higher than our best estimates of [ORG North Koreans  ] in [LOC Burma  ] , and exactly how the [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] allegedly came to see some of them personally remains unclear . 
Many details provided [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] match those provided by other , seemingly unrelated , sources. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) COMMENT CONTINUED: We cannot , and readers should not , consider this report alone to be definitive proof or evidence of sizable [ORG North Korean  ] military involvement with the [MISC Burmese  ] regime . 
The [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] description made no reference at all to nuclear weapons or technology , or to surface-to-surface missiles , ballistic or otherwise . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] This account is perhaps best considered alongside other information of various origins indicating the [MISC Burmese  ] and [ORG North Koreans  ] are up to something ) something of a covert military or military-industrial nature . 
Exactly what , and on what scale , remains to be determined . 
Post will continue to monitor these developments and report as warranted .
