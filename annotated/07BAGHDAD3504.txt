[LOC BAGHDAD  ] 03136 Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission [PER Patricia A. Butenis  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) CONFIDENTIAL SIPDIS ------- Summary ------- ( C ) 1 . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] obtained a copy of with the results of the Government of [LOC Iraq  ] 's ( [ORG GOI  ] ) investigation report of the September 16 incident at [LOC Nisoor Square  ] . 
The report portrays the incident as an unprovoked attack on unarmed civilians , references a number of other alleged incidents involving [LOC Blackwater  ] , recommends payments of $8 million and $4 million for each death and injury respectively , and calls for the USG to replace [LOC Blackwater  ] within six months of the incident . 
It is unclear to what extent the [ORG GOI  ] is committed to these recommendations or how it intends to implement them . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] has begun accepting claims from victims of the incident , with 15 claims submitted so far . 
Post has approved payments of $10,000 for each death , $5,000 for each injury , and $2,500 for property damage . 
The [ORG Regional Security Office  ] ( [ORG RSO  ] ) is implementing changes to procedures and increasing linkages to the [ORG GOI  ] for cooperation and information sharing on PSD issues . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] is awaiting the Department 's determination as to what information about past PSD incidents can be shared with the [ORG Joint Commission  ] , and is developing a work plan to guide the meetings of the [ORG Joint Commission  ] ; this work plan will also form the basis of Post 's proposed structure for the [ORG Joint Commission  ] 's report. ----------------- [ORG GOI  ] Investigation ----------------- ( C ) 2 . 
On October 11 the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] ( [ORG MOD  ] ) gave the [ORG Embassy  ] a copy of the final report of its investigative committee . 
The report was produced and endorsed by the eight [MISC Iraqi  ] members of the [ORG Joint Commission  ] . 
The details of the incident as described in the report portray a random and unprovoked shooting involving small and medium arms fire resulting in the deaths of vehicle passengers and bystanders . 
The report states that there was no evidence the convoy was fired upon , that a total of 17 [MISC Iraqis  ] were killed , 27 wounded , 7 cars burned or damaged , and that 2 [ORG Iraqi Security Forces  ] were among the casualties . 
( C ) 3 . 
The report concludes that the conduct of the [ORG PSD  ] violated [MISC Iraqi  ] law and a number of [MISC CPA  ] orders and that therefore the incident is a pre-meditated murder for which the [LOC Blackwater  ] personnel must be held accountable . 
It also claims that the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] has information on seven other instances in which [LOC Blackwater  ] personnel killed 10 [MISC Iraqis  ] and wounded 15 others . 
It states that due to these previous violations , the company 's license was not renewed after it expired in June 2006 . 
The report makes 5 recommendations: -- 1: That a court investigate the crime and take actions as stipulated by relevant [MISC CPA  ] and [MISC Iraqi  ] law immediately. -- 2: That the [ORG Council of Ministers  ] requests the [LOC U.S.  ] Government replace [LOC Blackwater  ] within six months of the incident and replace it with a more disciplined company. -- 3: That [LOC Blackwater  ] pay $8 million for each death and $4 million for each injury. -- 4: That the [ORG MOI  ] address the issue of [LOC Blackwater  ] operating illegally ( without a license ) . -- 5: That new legislation governing security contractors drafted by the [ORG MOI  ] and currently being considered by legislative bodies be adopted as quickly as possible ( Ref A ) . ------------------------------------ [ORG Embassy  ] Approves Condolence Payments ------------------------------------ ( C ) 4 . 
On October 18 and October 20 the [ORG Embassy  ] sent a team to the [ORG National Iraqi Assistance Center  ] , a facility where [MISC MNF-I  ] collects claims paperwork from [MISC Iraqis  ] injured in [MISC MNF-I  ] incidents , to collect applications from the [LOC Nisoor Square  ] incident . 
The [ORG Iraqi National Police  ] previously provided the [ORG Embassy  ] with contact information of family members for 7 of the 17 [MISC Iraqis  ] killed and for 15 of the 27 injured , all of whom were contacted . 
So far the [ORG Embassy  ] has received paperwork for 15 claims , including one claim form that was previously submitted to [MISC MNF-I  ] . 
( C ) 5 . 
On October 21 the [ORG Embassy Claims  ] and Condolence [ORG Committee  ] , chaired by the [ORG DCM  ] , reviewed the claims submitted . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] 's claims and condolence program is modeled after [MISC MNC-I  ] 's , which typically provides up to $2,500 per incident ( death , injury or property damage ) but which permits payments of up to $10,000 per incident in extraordinary circumstances , if approved by the [ORG MNC-I Division Commanding General  ] . 
Consistent with military practice and with the Ambassador 's approval , the [ORG Committee  ] agreed to make payments of $10,000 to the family members of those killed , $5,000 to those injured , and $2,500 for each instance of property damage . 
The [ORG Committee  ] agreed to arrange a forum for payment to the 15 claimants who have already filed paperwork , to expedite this payment , and to work with the [ORG GOI  ] to contact the remaining potential claimants . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] believes that [LOC Blackwater  ] should also make its own payments in this incident , and requests the Department 's assistance in conveying this message. --------------------------------------------- -- Preparing for the next [ORG Joint Commission Meeting  ] --------------------------------------------- -- ( C ) 6 . 
As agreed at the first [ORG Joint Commission Meeting  ] on October 7 ( Ref A ) , the [ORG Embassy  ] is working with the Department to decide what information regarding the [LOC Nisoor Square  ] and other [ORG PSD  ] incidents can be shared with the [ORG Commission  ] . 
The [ORG Embassy Legal Advisor  ] is developing a work plan for the [ORG Commission  ] , which , after consultation with our [LOC Iraq  ] working level counterparts , we plan to introduce at the next meeting . 
The goal of this plan is to have each of the [ORG Joint Commission  ] 's meetings focus on one of the major themes of the report that the [ORG Commission  ] will ultimately issue. --------------------------------------------- ---- Investigation and [ORG Regional Security Office Update  ] --------------------------------------------- ---- ( C ) 7 . 
The [ORG FBI  ] continues its investigation with support from the [ORG Regional Security Officer  ] ( [ORG RSO  ] ) as needed . 
The [ORG RSO  ] is implementing changes to its operating procedures . 
[ORG Diplomatic Security  ] ( [ORG DS  ] ) agents are now in charge of and accompanying all Chief of Mission ( [ORG COM  ] ) motorcade movements in [LOC Baghdad  ] outside of the [ORG IZ  ] and to the extent possible in the rest of [LOC Iraq  ] . 
An increased staffing pattern to sustain this larger workload has been approved by Post Management and has been submitted to the Department . 
[ORG DS  ] is in the process of procuring video systems for all [ORG PSD  ] vehicles and communications recording equipment for the [ORG Tactical Operations Center  ] . 
The [ORG RSO  ] is also taking technological steps to improve the mutual awareness of [ORG RSO  ] and [MISC MNC-I  ] elements in the field , and is procuring radios that will allow tactical communications between [ORG RSO  ] air and ground assets and [MISC MNC-I  ] assets . 
( C ) 8 . 
The [ORG RSO  ] is also forming an investigative response unit that will potentially include [MISC MNF-I  ] and [ORG GOI  ] representatives , to investigate all incidents involving [ORG COM  ] security assets , including statistical analysis and metrics of [ORG PSD  ] incidents and systematic collection and archiving of recorded video footage and radio communications . 
Additionally , the [ORG RSO  ] is reviewing the viability of alternative non-lethal escalation of force procedures . 
( C ) 9 . 
The [ORG RSO  ] is working to improve linkages to the [ORG GOI  ] for the general sharing of information and investigation of specific [ORG PSD  ] incidents . 
The [ORG RSO  ] will be participating regularly in the [ORG GOI/USG Crisis Action Cell  ] , which is a weekly meeting between senior [LOC U.S.  ] military officials , the Minister of [LOC Defense  ] , and the [ORG National Security Advisor  ] where [ORG PSD  ] incidents are often raised . 
The [ORG RSO  ] is scheduled to meet with the [ORG Chiefs of the Iraqi Police  ] and the [ORG National Police  ] in an effort to develop closer working-level relationships. -------------- Media Coverage -------------- ( C ) 10 . 
The [LOC Nisoor Square  ] incident and private security contractors in general have continued to receive negative coverage and have served as rallying points for [MISC Iraqi  ] politicians and government officials ( both those in power and in the opposition ) . 
Coverage of the establishment of the [ORG Joint Commission  ] stemmed mostly from [LOC U.S.  ] Government statements about it . 
Coverage of [ORG GOI  ] statements included those of [MISC Al-Dabbagh  ] on October 7 saying that the [MISC Iraqi  ] investigation found [LOC Blackwater  ] responsible for " deliberate murder " . 
Other reports focused on the [ORG GOI  ] 's call for [LOC Blackwater  ] to pay a total of $136 million for the incident and comparing it to the [LOC Lockerbie  ] bombing . 
An October 9 incident involving [ORG Unity Resources Group  ] ( [ORG URG  ] ) , the [ORG PSD  ] of a USAID contractor , in which two [MISC Iraqi  ] women were killed , was reported as a " [MISC Blackwater-type  ] massacre " . 
( C ) 11 . 
Newspaper and other coverage waned due to the Eid al-Fitr holiday , but [LOC Blackwater  ] returned to the press once the news cycle resumed , with reports focusing on the Prime Minister 's advisor [PER Sami al-Askri  ] who said " the [MISC Iraqi  ] government has a clear position regarding the future of [LOC Blackwater  ] in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The security firm should be expelled within six months . 
" Editorials in all of [LOC Iraq  ] 's newspapers have lashed out at [LOC Blackwater  ] , likening it to another militia contributing to the deterioration of [LOC Iraq  ] 's security . 
Numerous editorial cartoons have been published depicting [LOC Blackwater  ] as bloodthirsty mercenaries . 
While the escalation of the [MISC Turkish  ] border issue has been dominating the media , the [LOC Blackwater  ] incident will likely remain a prominent issue for editorials and political cartoons as the unpopularity of private security firms makes it an easy target .
