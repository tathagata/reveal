<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 [ORG MADRID  ] 002265 SIPDIS SIPDIS DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/WE E.O. 12958: [LOC DECL:  ] 12/15/2017 TAGS: <a href='/tag/PREL_0.html'>PREL</a> <a href='/tag/SP_0.html'>SP</a> SUBJECT: POLITICAL STRATEGIES DEVELOP FOR MARCH GENERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGNS Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission [PER Hugo Llorens  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [MISC SUMMARY: As  ] we head into the holidays , the polls continue to suggest a close race in the March general election , with President [PER Zapatero  ] and the [ORG Partido Socialista Obrero Espanol  ] ( [ORG PSOE  ] ) perhaps enjoying a slight lead over [PER Mariano Rajoy  ] and the [ORG Partido Popular  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) . 
Recent conversations with key figures in the leading parties suggest that when the campaign kicks into high gear in January , both parties will be emphasizing the economy ( with sharply different views on how it fares ) . 
The [ORG PSOE  ] will trumpet itself as the party of social tolerance and environmental protection . 
The [ORG PP  ] will argue that [PER Zapatero  ] has given too much ground to regional interests at the expense of [MISC Spanish  ] national unity , has been weak in dealing with [ORG ETA  ] , and has not adequately addressed the immigration issue . 
We do not expect foreign policy to be a key issue , although the [ORG PSOE  ] will remind socialist voters that a return of the [ORG PP  ] could mean a return to the pro-U.S. foreign policy of former [ORG PP  ] President [PER Aznar  ] . 
Both parties think turnout levels will be the determining factor , since [ORG PP  ] voters are widely believed to be more disciplined and hence could be over-represented if relatively few people vote on election day . 
END SUMMARY . 
[ORG PSOE  ] SECRETARY GENERAL CONFIDENT BUT HOLDING HIS CARDS CLOSE --------------------------------------------- --------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Pepe Blanco  ] , Secretary General of the [ORG PSOE  ] , acts as the de-facto party chairman and as the senior political advisor to [PER Zapatero  ] . 
Talking to the Ambassador , he compared this election to a heavy-weight title bout , and claimed the [ORG PP  ] was not really in the fight . 
[PER Blanco  ] said he had assembled the finest polling team ever to work in [MISC Spanish  ] politics . 
Boasting of his team 's technical expertise , [PER Blanco  ] said they had conducted extensive focus group sessions all over [LOC Spain  ] and would develop specific policy positions to reflect the interests of the voting public . 
[PER Blanco  ] confidentially expressed his certainty that the [ORG PSOE  ] had the clear advantage in the campaign , citing weekly polls consistently in favor of [PER Zapatero  ] , and estimated a winning margin of 6-7 points over [PER Rajoy  ] based on current data . 
[PER Blanco  ] also said the polls were trending upwards over the last several weeks. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Acknowledging that PSOE-inclined voters tend to be more complacent than [ORG PP  ] voters , [PER Blanco  ] said he would never make public any data showing [PER Zapatero  ] held a comfortable lead . 
[PER Blanco  ] 's strategy and tactics hinge on convincing the [ORG PSOE  ] voters that their vote is critical to prevent the [ORG PP  ] from regaining the Presidency . 
The message will be , as [PER Blanco  ] framed it bluntly , " vote for the [ORG PSOE  ] or live under the rule of reactionary Neanderthals . 
" He also admitted [PER Zapatero  ] is already seen as too moderate by some [ORG PSOE  ] " left-leaners " and they might be disinclined to cast a vote in his favor . 
Only by keeping the [ORG PSOE  ] voters feeling threatened with the possibility of a [ORG PP  ] victory could the strategists ensure that people will turn up at the polls on voting day. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Blanco  ] noted that if [ORG PSOE  ] does win the election , it will bring a major turnover in the [ORG PP  ] structure as [PER Rajoy  ] will be forced to turn over the reins to another political figure . 
[PER Blanco  ] and other officials like [PER Elena Valenciano  ] , [ORG PSOE  ] Secretary for Foreign Affairs , are counting on [PER Zapatero  ] 's SIPDIS voter appeal and what they describe as [PER Rajoy  ] 's " wooden " campaign style . 
[ORG PP  ] FOCUS ON ECONOMY , FAMILY ------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In a December 4 meeting with [PER Ana Pastor  ] , a close advisor to [PER Rajoy  ] , the Ambassador learned that the [ORG PP  ] campaign team was reassessing its strategy and implementing recommendations from [LOC U.S.  ] political consultants . 
In a moment of candor , [PER Pastor  ] said that the [ORG PP  ] assumed previously that [MISC Spanish  ] voters recognized implicitly [PER Rajoy  ] 's intellect and capacity , saying , " [PER Rajoy  ] would be a better President than he is a candidate . 
" [ORG PP  ] consultants advised that voters perceived [PER Rajoy  ] as distant and unsympathetic . 
The [ORG PP  ] team intends to create opportunities for [PER Rajoy  ] to show more empathy and human connection with voters . 
They will emphasize the importance of the family with linkages to health , education , financial independence and security . 
The [ORG PP  ] will also continue to focus on pocketbook issues such as rising interest rates ( home ownership -- vice renting -- and variable rate mortgages are the norm here ) and inflation . 
[PER Pastor  ] will work with [PER Rajoy  ] to put in place a credible finance team that can compete with the success of current Minister of Economy [PER Pedro Solbes  ] and articulate a strong [ORG MADRID  ] 00002265 002 OF 003 financial stability message to the electorate. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Pastor  ] , like other [ORG PP  ] interlocutors , criticized the [ORG PSOE  ] for diminishing [LOC Spain  ] 's international prestige during the last three years . 
According to [PER Pastor  ] , [PER Zapatero  ] abandoned the transatlantic relationship and reduced [LOC Spain  ] 's international influence . 
The [ORG PP  ] would seek to expand [LOC Spain  ] 's prestige and reaffirm key alliances . 
Citing missed opportunities and mishandling of important portfolios such as the [LOC Middle East  ] , [LOC North Africa  ] , [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] , [PER Pastor  ] admitted that foreign policy might not be a decisive issue in the March elections . 
Nevertheless , she argued that increased drug trafficking from [LOC Latin America  ] ( e.g. , [LOC Venezuela  ] ) and rising consumption in [LOC Spain  ] could give the [ORG PP  ] a way to tie the [ORG PSOE  ] 's foreign policy blunders to the concerns of ordinary voters. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Acknowledging that all politics are local and that the election would be won or lost on " hometown issues , " [PER Pastor  ] said that the " human connection " strategy would play a big part in regional politics . 
[LOC Andalucia  ] is a primary target for getting out the vote , and the [ORG PP  ] will play up the need for more education and training opportunities ( local press noted [LOC Andalucia  ] was ranked lower than [LOC Turkey  ] in a recent education survey ) . 
In [LOC Catalonia  ] , the [ORG PP  ] hopes a series of well-publicized debacles involving public infrastructure ( commuter train interruptions and electricity blackouts ) will lead [MISC Catalan  ] voters ( who are unlikely to vote for the [ORG PP  ] in any circumstance ) to stay home on election day . 
[ORG PP  ] SEEKS TO UP THE LEVEL OF CHARISMA ------------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) During a lunch hosted by the [ORG DCM  ] with five members of the [ORG PP  ] electoral committee , the guests recognized [PER Rajoy  ] was behind in the polls but claimed to take comfort from the fact that the polls failed to predict their strong showing in [LOC Spain  ] 's May 2005 municipal elections . 
The advisors theorized the campaign would be fought hardest in about 20 cities where congressional seats are won or lost by a handful of votes . 
Each party will put its most charismatic candidates on the ballots in these key areas ( e.g. , [LOC Valencia  ] ) . 
The [ORG PP  ] team said their campaign would focus on a softening economy , [PER Zapatero  ] 's alleged weakness in the face of [MISC Basque  ] and [MISC Catalan  ] demands for more autonomy and fiscal privileges , and rising concerns over immigration. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) If [ORG PP  ] did win the election , [PER Ignacio Astarloa  ] , [ORG PP  ] Executive Secretary for Security and [ORG Justice  ] , has been mentioned to us as the potential Minister of Interior ( among others by [PER Astarloa  ] himself ) and [PER Angel Acebes  ] , [ORG PP  ] General Secretary has been mentioned as Vice President and senior SIPDIS policy advisor . 
There has been hedging about who might be Minister of Foreign Affairs , with a hint that that [ORG PP  ] insiders such as [PER Jorge Moragas  ] or [PER Gustavo Aristegui  ] might be passed over in favor of a senior career diplomat. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Astarloa  ] told us he expects the March election to be close ( within two to three percent ) . 
He declined to speculate as to which party was ahead at this point , but he admitted what many observers have noted: the [ORG PP  ] might have overplayed its hand during the last eighteen months with its harsh criticism of the [ORG PSOE  ] for being soft on terrorism . 
Nevertheless , he believed [PER Rajoy  ] had much more credibility than [PER Zapatero  ] on security issues , and that , combined with effective messages on the economy and immigration , could win the day . 
Like [PER Pastor  ] , he emphasized framing issues in a way that connected with voters and cited immigration as one such issue . 
He noted the rising number of immigrants was beginning to affect ordinary [MISC Spaniards  ] as they sought access to social services such as health and education . 
He also believed immigration could be linked to law and order concerns such as gang violence . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) While the general sense seems to be that the [ORG PSOE  ] is slightly ahead , it is too early to make predictions . 
[PER Rajoy  ] has so far failed to land any body blows on [PER Zapatero  ] . 
Instead , the [ORG PSOE  ] has had some success ( thanks in part to [ORG PP  ] missteps ) in depicting the [ORG PP  ] as mean-spirited and needlessly divisive . 
Nevertheless , [MISC Spanish  ] voters will not get serious about this campaign until January or even February . 
[PER Rajoy  ] still has time to get his message across ( it appears there will be two televised debates ) . 
There is also the very real possibility that the softening economy , especially if unemployment jumps , will spook the voters . 
Finally , a boring or negative campaign could suppress turnout , which everyone seems to believe could hand the [ORG PP  ] a victory . 
[ORG MADRID  ] 00002265 003 OF 003 <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) A lurking issue for the [ORG PP  ] is that even if it beats the [ORG PSOE  ] , it may not win enough seats to govern without forming alliances with other parties . 
There are 350 seats in [ORG Congress  ] , and 176 are required to govern . 
In 2004 , the [ORG PSOE  ] won 164 , the [ORG PP  ] 148 , [PER CiU  ] ( the main [MISC Catalan  ] party ) ten , [ORG ERC  ] ( another [MISC Catalan  ] party ) eight , the [ORG PNV  ] ( the main [MISC Basque  ] party ) seven , the [ORG IU  ] ( far left ) five , and smaller parties a total of eight . 
The [ORG PSOE  ] combined with [ORG ERC  ] and [ORG IU  ] to add 13 to their total of 164 . 
The [ORG PP  ] electoral committee has acknowledged to us they might have to seek alliances with the [MISC Catalan  ] or [MISC Basque  ] parties to govern , but it is far from certain that parties from the same regions the [ORG PP  ] criticizes for demanding too much autonomy from the central government will ally themselves with the [ORG PP  ] if the time comes . 
Certainly they would try to exact a heavy price. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Finally , there is the unexpected . 
The terrorist attacks three days before the 2004 election probably cost the [ORG PP  ] the presidency ( certainly that is what the [ORG PP  ] believes ) . 
With the polls so close , no one can rule out some unforeseen event that would turn the campaigns upside down . 
Whatever the case , we will be watching closely .
