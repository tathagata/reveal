( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary . 
The week of March 12 , media coverage came fast and furious about the most recent [MISC Chinese  ] government sugar pot of financial contributions to some political parties in [LOC Suriname  ] 's [ORG New Front Plus  ] ( ruling ) Coalition . 
The media reported three of the [ORG New Front Plus Coalition  ] members unashamedly acknowledged receipt of contributions from the Government of [LOC China  ] ( [ORG GOC  ] ) , while others eschewed the practice . 
Ironically , in July 2007 the ruling coalition had adamantly protested as dollar diplomacy [LOC Taiwan  ] 's overtures to [LOC Suriname  ] . 
Apparently , some of the [ORG New Front Plus Coalition  ] is less concerned when the political donor is the [ORG GOC  ] . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On March 12 , a media flurry broke over the [MISC Chinese  ] government sugar pot of financial contributions for some political parties in [LOC Suriname  ] 's [ORG New Front Plus  ] ( ruling ) Coalition . 
On March 5 , former [ORG United Party  ] for the Interior ( [ORG BEP  ] ) Treasurer [PER Nagesing Ajeki  ] stated on the news broadcast [LOC Suriname  ] Vandaag ( [LOC Suriname  ] Today ) that [ORG BEP  ] had dismissed him because he had questioned inappropriate usage of party funds . 
( Note: [ORG BEP  ] is a member of the [MISC A-Combination  ] , a coalition of three smaller political parties -- the General Liberation and [ORG Development Party  ] ( [ORG ABOP  ] ) , [PER Seeka  ] , and [ORG BEP  ] , that together form one member of [LOC Suriname  ] 's ruling coalition .

) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On March 10 , during an [MISC A-Combination  ] meeting , [PER Ronnie Brunswijk  ] , [ORG ABOP Chair  ] and [MISC A-Combination  ] parliamentarian , raised the issue of these funds coming from a package of gifts from the Government of [LOC China  ] ( [ORG GOC  ] ) . 
( Note: The gifts were given to a 12-member [ORG BEP  ] delegation that traveled to [LOC China  ] from September 3-10 , 2007 . 
The media reported that in addition to the all-expense paid trip , [ORG BEP  ] party officials received between $80 and $125,000 dollars , and several student scholarships to [LOC China  ] . 
End Note . 
) [PER Brunswijk  ] argued gifts to any [MISC A-Combination  ] member should be shared with all members. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG BEP  ] chair and Deputy Speaker of the [ORG National Assembly Caprino Alendy  ] reportedly responded that the invitation to visit [LOC China  ] , financial gifts , and scholarships were explicitly directed to the [ORG BEP Party  ] , and would not be shared . 
In return , the [ORG GOC  ] apparently required [ORG BEP  ] to support the One [LOC China  ] Policy , according to one media report . 
[PER Brunswijk  ] , apparently unsatisfied with this response , made a public statement to the media. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In a domino effect , on March 13 and 14 , three of four national papers reported on additional [ORG GOC  ] financial gifts to other [MISC Surinamese  ] political parties . 
[ORG De Ware Tijd  ] ( the newspaper of record ) quoted the statement of [PER Winston Jessurun  ] , leader of [MISC Democratic  ] 91 ( DA91 ) , another [ORG New Front Plus Coalition  ] member party , that the [ORG GOC  ] had made a generous contribution to the ruling coalition in the aftermath of [LOC Suriname  ] 's 2005 national election . 
This donation was distributed amongst the coalition member parties based on a distribution code . 
[PER Jessurun  ] 's statement was echoed by [ORG United Reform Party  ] ( [ORG VHP  ] ) First Secretary [PER Mahinder Rathipal  ] , who said [LOC China  ] has supported us , and has offered support when necessary , and by [PER Pertjajah Luhur  ] ( [ORG PL  ] ) Vice Chair [PER Ronny Tamsiran  ] , who stated there is nothing wrong when a friendly nation donates money or goods to a political party. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Other coalition members sang a different tune . 
[ORG Surinamese Labor Party  ] ( [ORG SPA  ] ) Secretary for Foreign Relations [PER John Defares  ] said no [ORG SPA  ] members had received gifts from the [ORG GOC  ] . 
First Secretary [PER Sunil Oemrawsing  ] of the [ORG National Party of Suriname  ] ( [ORG NPS  ] ) , the party of President [PER Venetiaan  ] , said media reports were absolutely , absolutely untrue . 
( Note: The [ORG NPS  ] is the party of choice for many [MISC Chinese-origin  ] Surinamers , and has a large [LOC China  ] lobby within the party . 
End Note . 
) In the meantime , representatives of opposition parties [ORG Political Wing of the Federation of Agricultural Workers  ] ( [ORG PVF  ] ) and the [ORG National Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG NDP  ] ) said neither party had received gifts or trips to [LOC China.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment . 
In this media flurry , the tables turned on the [ORG GOC  ] . 
Media coverage in the past has focused on ruling coalition complaints of [LOC Taiwan  ] 's dollar diplomacy overtures to [LOC Suriname  ] , a hot topic in July 2007 . 
Current reporting shows the [MISC Surinamese  ] public that , in fact , the [ORG New Front Plus Coalition  ] is of two minds on whether it is appropriate for PARAMARIBO 00000085 002 OF 002 political parties to accept sugar pots . 
Apparently for some in the ruling coalition , dollar diplomacy is defined differently when the donor is the [ORG GOC  ] rather than [LOC Taiwan  ] .
