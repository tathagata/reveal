( C ) Summary: In a remarkably wide-ranging tour de force equally remarkable for its candor , former finance minister and leading Socialist party presidential candidate [PER Dominique Strauss-Kahn  ] shared with Ambassador [PER Stapleton May  ] 16 his views that: the [ORG Clearstream  ] scandal is far from over ; the Socialist Party can win in the 2007 presidential elections and that there will not be a repeat of 2002 ; his most difficult hurdle in his quest for the presidency will be to win his party 's nomination over [PER Segolene Royal  ] ; tackling significant reform in [LOC France  ] is all the more difficult for being necessary ; [LOC France  ] 's main problem is its current lack of confidence in itself ; and the [PER Chirac  ] presidency looks increasingly to be marked by failure . 
End summary . 
[ORG Clearstream  ] and the [ORG Censure Motion  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In a May 16 meeting with the Ambassador , Former finance minister , Socialist Party ( [ORG PS  ] ) heavyweight and presidential contender [PER Dominique Strauss-Kahn  ] ( known here as [ORG DSK  ] ) insisted on the seriousness of the censure motion vote tabled earlier by the [ORG PS  ] , to be voted on later the same afternoon , in connection with the [ORG Clearstream  ] scandal ( see also ref A ) . 
While the outcome was a foregone conclusion , and such motions generally were little more than political " theater " given the institutional realities of the [LOC Fifth Republic  ] , he asserted that it was nonetheless important . 
This was especially so given the decision by some leading center-right [ORG UMP  ] governing party deputies ( ref B ) not to be present for the vote and center-right [ORG UDF  ] party president [PER Francois Bayrou  ] 's decision to vote for the censure motion. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Although [ORG DSK  ] dismissed [PER Bayrou  ] 's decision as political posturing to maximize his own first-round presidential election chances ( [ORG DSK  ] judged that [PER Bayrou  ] would receive only 6-9 percent of the first-round vote ) , he judged that an alliance with the left -- even if [PER Bayrou  ] switched to supporting the right in the second round -- could potentially have significant ramifications for a left-right face-off in the second round of the 2007 presidential elections . 
He hedged about the impact in the end , however , noting that most [ORG UDF  ] voters were probably more to the right than their leaders . 
2007 Between Center-Left and Center-Right ----------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG DSK  ] was confident that the second round would be a contest between the [ORG UMP  ] and the [ORG PS  ] , notwithstanding the current popularity of extremist elements on the left and the right . 
But voters had learned from the 2002 elections , where their protest votes cost [MISC Jospin  ] the elections . 
He predicted that the [ORG PS  ] candidate would garner around 22-23 percent , with likely [ORG UMP  ] candidate [PER Sarkozy  ] getting closer to 24-25 percent of the first-round vote . 
[PER Chirac  ] 's initial 2002 score of less than 20 percent was , [ORG DSK  ] asserted , an historical anomaly . 
[ORG DSK  ] was adamant that far-right [ORG National Front  ] leader [PER Jean-Marie Le Pen  ] would come in third . 
Even if he managed to exceed his initial score of 2002 , it would still not be enough . 
[MISC Villepin Will Survive  ] , Good for Left ------------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG DSK  ] acknowledged when asked that it would probably be better for the [ORG PS  ] if [PER Villepin  ] stayed in office until the end of [PER Chirac  ] 's term , given that the prospects were for " one year of nothing . 
" Even if [PER Chirac  ] did decide to jettison [PER Villepin  ] , it is not clear whom [PER Chirac  ] should name as a successor . 
[ORG DSK  ] concluded that , if the current government managed to survive until the beginning of the [MISC World Cup  ] in late June , then it would sail through the July/August holiday period . 
When September rolled around , the electorate would be more focused on the 2007 presidential elections than trying to boot the incumbent government out of office. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Asked if this meant that the [ORG Clearstream  ] affair would therefore soon be forgotten , [ORG DSK  ] ( in contrast to some ) responded that " this was only the beginning . 
" He was struck by secret investigator General [PER Rondot  ] 's decision not to meet with the investigating judges , commenting that " this meant there was someone more he feared than the judges " ( by implication , with something to hide ) . 
Explaining , he added that [PER Rondot  ] was a military guy who was obeying orders . 
Someone had told him to stonewall , which is why he had gone silent . 
Turning to a putative meeting on [ORG Clearstream  ] between [PER Chirac  ] and [PER Sarkozy  ] , he said [PER Chirac  ] had asked [PER Sarkozy  ] what the risks were of [ORG Clearstream  ] continuing , and [PER Sarkozy  ] had responded " 100 percent . 
" [ORG DSK  ] concluded that , although the scandal might disappear from the public eye , the [LOC PARIS  ] 00003360 002 OF 004 investigations would continue . 
He lamented that [LOC France  ] was not a more mature democracy like the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG DSK  ] said that [PER Sarkozy  ] had rightly understood that voters felt touched by the scandal and were demanding justice , even if they could not understand it fully . 
His dilemma was that , if he stayed in the government , this would only bewilder voters and reinforce their alienation . 
[PER Chirac  ] , [ORG DSK  ] continued , could have put an end to the story by changing prime ministers . 
Government Dead in Water ------------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Turning to [PER Villepin  ] , [PER DSK  ] recalled his last press conference during which he had touted small improvements in the unemployment situation . 
But this did not fool anyone , he asserted . 
[ORG DSK  ] explained that it was difficult to flaunt a tiny improvement in one area when , at the same time , the overall economic situation was not good and deteriorating , and social tensions were on the uptick . 
Moreover , the controversy over the [ORG First Employment Contract  ] , a measure of little significance per se , had now made further reform almost impossible . 
Admiration for [PER Sarkozy  ] ---------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG DSK  ] agreed that the [ORG PS  ] had benefited from the [ORG Clearstream  ] scandal , although he acknowledged that every party or figure had skeletons in the closet . 
He nonetheless complained that [PER Sarkozy  ] had overdone it in portraying himself as a victim and that this would reap little sympathy on the left . 
[ORG DSK  ] characterized [PER Sarkozy  ] 's overall strategy simply as one of being determined to win , but readily admitted that he was an extremely talented politician who had managed successfully to turn voters' concerns about growing crime , for example , to his own benefit . 
[ORG DSK  ] expressed astonishment that [PER Sarkozy  ] was running on a platform of claiming that he " knew the solutions to [LOC France  ] 's problems , but would not reveal or implement them until elected . 
" This was a permissible strategy for the opposition party , he complained , but was hard to sustain for someone already in power . 
[ORG Chirac Prefers Left  ] to [PER Sarkozy  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [ORG DSK  ] also judged that [PER Sarkozy  ] had positioned himself so far to the right that he would have difficulty moving back to the center . 
He claimed there was a large number of [PER Chirac  ] supporters who would not vote for [PER Sarkozy  ] as president . 
[ORG DSK  ] vigorously affirmed that [PER Chirac  ] was " an objective ally " who would prefer a victory of the left to having [PER Sarkozy  ] succeed him for a number of reasons: he did not deem [PER Sarkozy  ] a " worthy " successor ( just as [ORG Mitterrand  ] had favored [PER Chirac  ] over [MISC Jospin  ] ) ; he was a " radical-socialist " ( in the [MISC French  ] sense ) at heart in any case , in contrast to [PER Sarkozy  ] , the free market " liberal . 
" [PER Chirac  ] also feared [PER Sarkozy  ] was more likely than the left to pursue him in the courts for past scandals in which he was implicated . 
( [ORG Note:  ] The [MISC French  ] Radical party fits loosely into the [MISC Christian  ] democratic tradition of capitalism with a strong social component . 
) [ORG Royal Leading  ] for Now , [LOC But...  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Asked about the presidential nomination process in the [ORG PS  ] , [ORG DSK  ] referred to [PER Segolene Royal  ] 's commanding lead in public opinion polls as a " collective hallucination " and reminded the Ambassador that , in [LOC France  ] , those who were poll leaders six months before the elections -- [PER Giscard d'Estaing  ] in 1981 , [PER Balladur  ] in 1995 , and [MISC Jospin  ] in 2002 were the most recent examples -- had invariably lost . 
[ORG DSK  ] predicted that [ORG Royal  ] would eventually crumble and that , if nominated by the [ORG PS  ] , would not survive against [PER Sarkozy  ] . 
He noted wryly in that [PER Sarkozy  ] had already reached the same conclusion , which explained why he continued to extol her qualities as a potential candidate . 
[ORG DSK  ] added that while she had a decent chance of winning the " internal " debate within the [ORG PS  ] , she would have much more difficulty winning the " external " debate with [PER Sarkozy  ] , even with good advisors and handlers . 
Not of [ORG Presidential Timber  ] -------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Within the [ORG PS  ] , according to [ORG DSK  ] , [ORG Royal  ] was not as popular , as she drew much of her public support from the right and center . 
He claimed that 80 percent of the party was not behind her , and dismissed announcements of support from various mayors as falling far short of a snowball effect . 
[PER DSK  ] asserted that activists in the party " sensed , " for example , that [ORG Royal  ] could not imagine herself in the international arena , for example , negotiating gas agreements with [PER Putin  ] ; good advisors would not be able to make up for her rather shallow experience . 
He noted that she had not become the President of the [LOC Poitou-Charentes  ] region by defeating former prime minister [PER Raffarin  ] , as has been claimed ; she had simply won the seat that he had vacated . 
[LOC PARIS  ] 00003360 003 OF 004 She had never won a tough election battle , he contended , and there were no assurances that she would be able to do so . 
He described her several times as " fragile but not in the feminine sense , " not up to a real debate on the issues . 
The problem , he admitted readily , was that she was currently popular and that even her most banal pronouncements -- such as being a " [MISC Blairite  ] " in the positive sense when it was he , [PER DSK  ] , who had carried this label for years -- were greeted as major media events . 
[ORG DSK  ] 's Strategy for Winning -------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Asked to outline his own strategy for winning the presidency , [PER DSK  ] said that the party was currently divided in thirds between supporters of [ORG Royal  ] , of him , and of former prime minister [PER Laurent Fabius  ] . 
His hope was that a debate -- the holding of which he admitted would be difficult to arrange -- among candidates within the party would produce a choice based on substance and that candidate 's potential for defeating [PER Sarkozy  ] . 
He did not believe [ORG Royal  ] could win on either count . 
New [ORG PS  ] members had joined on the basis of being able to participate in the outcome , and this could not occur without a debate ; if [ORG Royal  ] tried to prevent a debate , then she would be perceived as hiding something . 
[PER DSK  ] summarized his strategy as getting past the highest hurdle first: the key for him would be to come in at least second in the initial first round of the party 's selection ( not at all a sure thing ) , and then win in the second round . 
( [ORG Note:  ] The clear implication was that if [ORG DSK  ] and [ORG Royal  ] survive the first round , the supporters of [PER Fabius  ] would shift their support to [ORG DSK  ] in the second round . 
) Similarly , in the presidential elections , if [ORG DSK  ] made it to the second round ( which he believed would be possible for whoever was the [ORG PS  ] candidate ) , then he would be the best positioned to defeat [PER Sarkozy  ] in the final round . 
[PER Jospin  ] Out ; [PER Hollande  ] 's Mistakes ------------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER DSK  ] did not believe that former prime minister [PER Jospin  ] would be the party 's nominee , as he could not seek the nomination directly and the party was unlikely to offer it to him on a platter absent some serious crisis . 
[PER DSK  ] believed that he would benefit most from [MISC Jospin  ] supporters , given [PER Jospin  ] 's opposition to [ORG Royal  ] and [PER Fabius  ] . 
[PER DSK  ] was critical of First Secretary [PER Hollande  ] , saying that he had yielded to the temptation of being a presidential candidate himself , when more even-handed treatment of other candidates would have assured him a place as prime minister in any new government and kept alive his presidential aspirations for the future . 
[PER Hollande  ] was described as a good tactician but poor strategist , who would be left out in the cold if [ORG Royal  ] won , given his status as her domestic partner . 
[PER DSK  ] claimed that [PER Hollande  ] had initially proposed [ORG Royal  ] 's candidacy as a way to preserve his own chances , but that the sorcerer 's apprentice had taken on a life of her own . 
This attempted " privatisation " of the party 's agenda had damaged [PER Hollande  ] 's reputation . 
Domestic Situation Key ---------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Looking to the 2007 presidential elections , [PER DSK  ] criticized [PER Villepin  ] for putting students in the streets over a triviality ( the CPE , or First Employment Contract ) rather than something important and more worthy of a fight . 
The main issue , [PER DSK  ] said , is economic growth , not this or that reform of the labor code . 
[LOC France  ] needed to focus on basic reforms , such as of its universities , not on whether a youth under 26 could be fired without a proper explanation . 
Given the overall sense of insecurity in [LOC France  ] , particularly among parents who feared that their children would have worse lives than they , [PER DSK  ] thought foreign policy would play only a very modest role in the elections , notwithstanding the public 's interest in [LOC Iran  ] and terrorism. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Nor did [PER DSK  ] believe that [LOC Europe  ] would be a major election issue , since [LOC France  ] was currently too obsessed with its own situation to look more broadly even toward [LOC Europe  ] . 
[PER DSK  ] said the 2007 presidential elections would evolve around the same set of issues , with the left and right platforms being mirror images of each other . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] would emphasize immigration and security , and the left would emphasize employment and integration . 
He predicted that if [PER Sarkozy  ] succeeded in getting voters to focus on security , then he would win , whereas the left would need to emphasize the economy . 
He said the left had lost in 2002 because it had allowed the right to set the agenda . 
Whoever [MISC Wins Will Have  ] it Tough ------------------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [PER DSK  ] said that whoever won the 2007 elections would have little room for maneuver in effecting change . 
Things [LOC PARIS  ] 00003360 004 OF 004 would not be as easy as in 1997 , when it was possible to stimulate the economy out of recession . 
The left would need to take risks if elected , and work harder to reform the system . 
It would be critical to act quickly , based on the mandate of an election . 
For the mid-term , [PER DSK  ] cited the importance of more investment in growth sectors . 
Over the shorter term , it was important for [MISC French  ] companies to regain confidence in [LOC France  ] . 
He blamed [ORG Chirac  ] for creating anxiety in business and cynicism among the elites . 
Part of [ORG Royal  ] 's current success was that she had tapped into the country 's need to have pride in itself . 
[PER DSK  ] suggested that little would remain of [ORG Chirac  ] 's [MISC European  ] legacy besides a failed referendum and a proposal to reduce the value-added tax for [MISC French  ] restaurants . 
[LOC France  ] , he said , needed someone who could show the way forward . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] could do that , he said , but [ORG Royal  ] would be unable to do so . 
There was not enough " beef " there . 
One Last Bold Step from [ORG Chirac  ] ? ------------------------------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [PER DSK  ] concluded with the thought that it was not too late for [ORG Chirac  ] to show true leadership . 
He could quit now , call for a renewal of [LOC France  ] , call for early elections , and announce his resignation for a date that would permit both sides to prepare properly for them . 
In this way he could serve [LOC France  ] and save his reputation . 
[PER DSK  ] stopped there , obviously concluding , but not saying , that [ORG Chirac  ] would never do it . 
Comment ------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [PER DSK  ] was lively and engaging , full of good humor , and remarkably modest and without pretensions . 
That may prove to be his undoing . 
While he was openly critical of [ORG Royal  ] , he also readily admitted that she was doing many things right . 
And while he clearly viewed himself as the right man to lead [LOC France  ] , he seemed reluctant to beat his own drum and was spare with prescriptions about what he would do if chosen to be [LOC France  ] 's next president . 
The impression left was that , while he may be the most capable and qualified candidate among the Socialists , he lacks the fire in the belly that would propel him to victory . 
He is one of those who would clearly be better governing than campaigning -- and therefore may never get the chance to govern .
