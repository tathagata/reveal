[MISC SWEDISH  ] PIRATES SET SAIL FOR [LOC BRUSSELS  ] <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
Summary and Comment: Sweden’s two largest political parties , the ruling Moderates and opposition [MISC Social Democrats  ] , saw little change over their 2004 levels of support in the June 7 [ORG European Parliament  ] ( [ORG EP  ] ) election here . 
Instead , the [ORG Greens  ] and the [ORG pro-EU Liberal Party  ] were the big winners -- along with the new [ORG Pirate Party  ] , which found support from young voters unhappy with the government’s decision to shut down The [LOC Pirate Bay  ] , a file-sharing bit torrent site that had become a target of the [ORG Motion Picture Association of America  ] ( and USTR ) . 
The [ORG anti-EU Left Party  ] , on the other hand , suffered catastrophic losses . 
Overall , voter turnout was up in the month before [LOC Sweden  ] takes over the rotating Presidency of the [ORG Council of the European Union  ] , but at 43.8% still far below the regular 80% turnout for national elections . 
Comment: The [ORG EP  ] election outcome has little predictive power for next year’s parliamentary elections , given the self-selecting nature of those willing to go out and vote for Members of the [ORG European Parliament  ] ( MEPs ) . 
Perhaps the main lesson for the larger parties relates to the need to court the youth vote in more effective ways . 
End Summary and Comment . 
The Results ----------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
Sweden’s [ORG EP  ] election was a bit disappointing for the two largest parties , the Moderates ( 18.8% of the vote and 4 MEP seats ) and the [MISC Social Democrats  ] ( 24.6% and five seats ) . 
Although both parties matched the figures received in 2004 , they did not manage any gains despite active campaigning . 
Rather , the [ORG Greens  ] ( 10.9% and two seats ) and the [ORG Liberal Party  ] ( 13.6% and three seats ) were the big winners . 
The [ORG Left Party  ] suffered disastrous defeats ; the party dropped to 5.6% , compared to 12.8% in 2004 , and now has one seat . 
The [ORG Centre Party  ] ( 5.5% and one seat ) and the [MISC Christian Democrats  ] ( 4.7% and one seat ) , both part of the four-party ruling coalition , performed slightly worse than in 2004 , though both surpassed the 4% threshold necessary to qualify for a seat . 
The elections attracted more voters than in 2004 , with turnout up 6.7% to 43.8% , differentiating [LOC Sweden  ] from other Member [MISC States’  ] downward trend . 
Victory for the [ORG Pirate Party  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
The big winner was the [ORG Pirate Party  ] -- which campaigned on reformation of copyright and patent law and opposition to a wiretapping law proposed by the [MISC Swedish  ] security services . 
The [ORG Pirates  ] secured a whopping 7.1% and one seat in Parliament . 
The party , founded in January 2006 , attracted young voters angry over the guilty verdict in the [LOC Pirate Bay  ] trial , the unpopular [ORG EU  ] Ipred directive , and new national laws criminalizing file sharing and authorizing monitoring of emails . 
The party has not yet announced what [ORG EP  ] party group it would like to belong to , and the current thinking espoused by [ORG Pirates  ] is that the classic political right-left scale is outdated . 
Rather , the [ORG Pirates  ] see themselves as an historic movement analogous to working-class and the green movements . 
The party is now looking to negotiate with both the liberal [ORG ALDE  ] group and the [MISC Greens/EFA  ] group. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
A side effect of the [MISC Pirates’  ] success is that it most likely reduced the chances for the far-right nationalist [LOC Sweden  ] [MISC Democrats  ] to gain representation in the [ORG EP  ] . 
The [ORG Pirates  ] have some of the same voter base -- young men with mistrust for politicians . 
Although the [LOC Sweden  ] [MISC Democrats  ] tripled their results to 3.3% , up from 1.1% in 2004 , they remain below the threshold for representation in either the [ORG EP  ] or [MISC Swedish  ] Parliament . 
In any case , the [MISC Pirate’s  ] landslide among younger voters caught the attention of the larger parties , our contacts tell us , who are now scrambling to come up with policies to woo the youth back to the mainstream . 
[PER Personalities Rule  ] ------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
Over all , the four party governing center-right [ORG Alliance  ] won with 42.6% of vote and nine seats over the leftist opposition with 41.1% and eight seats . 
For what was essentially a mid-term election in [LOC Sweden  ] , the continued strong showing for the ruling coalition suggests to some of our contacts no loss of momentum going into next year’s general elections . 
Others note that parties with clear and positive [ORG EU  ] policies , like the [ORG Greens  ] and the [MISC Liberals  ] , did surprisingly well , while the euro-skeptics suffered . 
But those who could be bothered to vote in [ORG EP  ] elections on the first sunny day in several weeks were likely a self-selecting group with pro-EU views , not necessarily representative of the wider [MISC Swedish  ] public. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
Results of the preference vote - where voters can mark the candidate they would prefer to be elected - came out June 10 . 
Strong and charismatic personalities have overtaken the top candidates proposed by each of the parties . 
To be elected on a total number of preference votes , a candidate must have received at least 5% of the votes cast for the party . 
[PER Alf Svensson  ] , former leader of the [MISC Christian Democrats  ] , and [PER Anna Maria Corazza Bildt  ] , the wife of Foreign Minister [PER Carl Bildt  ] , were nominated low on their respective parties’ lists but will now claim seats in parliament .
