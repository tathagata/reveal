( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY: The Director for the [LOC White House Office  ] of [ORG National Drug Control Policy  ] ( [ORG ONDCP  ] ) , [PER John Walters  ] visited The [ORG Hague  ] on April 5-6 , at the end of a three-nation tour that included stops in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Belgium  ] . 
[PER Walters  ] met with [PER Thomas Driessen  ] , Director of the [ORG Dutch National Crime Squad  ] , the [MISC Dutch  ] Ministers of Health and Justice--who share responsibility for drug policy in The [MISC Netherlands--and  ] the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] Director General for [ORG Political Affairs Hugo Siblesz  ] . 
[PER Walters  ] provided a readout of his trip to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , noting that considerable progress had been made in poppy eradication . 
He also commended the [MISC Dutch  ] for the substantial steps they have taken to curb their Ecstasy trade . 
The Director promised to send an [ORG ONDCP  ] staffer to The [ORG Hague  ] soon to further follow-up on the bilateral statement of cooperation that he and Health Minister [PER Hoogervorst  ] signed last July . 
[ORG Siblesz  ] updated [PER Walters  ] on the current state of play in [MISC Dutch  ] international anti-drug cooperation , particularly related to the [LOC Caribbean  ] and [LOC Latin America  ] . 
[PER Walters  ] welcomed the [MISC Dutch  ] efforts and expressed his intent to continue to engage the [MISC Dutch  ] on counter-drug initiatives , particularly in the area of research and drug treatment efforts . 
[PER Walters  ] was accompanied by Ambassador [PER Arnall  ] , [ORG ONDCP Special Assistant  ] to the Director [PER James O'Gara  ] , [ORG ONDCP Assistant Deputy  ] Director for the [ORG Office of Supply Reduction  ] [PER Patrick Ward  ] , [ORG ONDCP Policy  ] Analyst [PER Charlotte Sisson  ] , [ORG DEA Country Attache  ] [PER Jeffrey Boobar  ] , and [ORG US Embassy  ] Officer [PER Lisa Brooks.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG ONDCP  ] Director Walters' visit to The [ORG Hague  ] began with a briefing from the Director of the [ORG National Crime Squad  ] , [PER Tom Driessen  ] . 
[PER Driessen  ] noted that his organization had been operational for only two years , is under the control of the Justice Minister , and has responsibility for organized crime , including counter-drug , counterterrorism , and illegal weapon interdiction operations . 
He said that the establishment of the [ORG Crime Squad  ] had significantly enhanced the ability of the [MISC Dutch  ] police to cooperate effectively with international partners ; previously investigations of serious crimes were decentralized in the 25 regional police forces . 
He stressed that international cooperation was vital . 
The [LOC Netherlands  ] is a major transit point for narcotics entering the [MISC European  ] market -- the [LOC Miami  ] of [LOC Western Europe  ] -- and consequently the [MISC Dutch  ] police rely on relationships with partners , especially in the area of intelligence sharing , to combat criminal organizations that operate in several countries . 
[PER Driessen  ] conceded that insufficient progress had been made on efforts to track and interdict illicit money . 
He noted that [MISC Dutch  ] privacy laws and limited resources make it necessary for police and prosecutors to concentrate on stopping the sale , production , and distribution of drugs ; following the flow of illicit finances is a lower priority ; this is an area where international assistance is particularly valuable . 
He further noted that while countries such as the [LOC United States  ] have a easier time stopping illicit finances because of more liberal banking laws , in the [LOC Netherlands  ] it is easier to obtain permission to do wiretapping operations: each system has its advantages and disadvantages with regards to law enforcement tools at its disposal . 
( Comment: [PER Driessen  ] is extremely pro-US and was instrumental in convincing the GONL to allow [ORG DEA  ] agents to co-locate with the [ORG National Crime Squad Cocaine Unit  ] . 
End Comment . 
) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Driessen  ] noted that the [MISC Dutch  ] public continues to distinguish between soft drugs ( marijuana ) and hard drugs ( cocaine and heroin ) . 
They tolerate personal consumption of soft drugs because there are no definitive studies showing that marijuana has serious health consequences for casual users . 
[PER Driessen  ] noted that drug consumption in The [LOC Netherlands  ] has stabilized , and the [ORG DEA Attache  ] added that the average age of first-time drug users is going up in [LOC Holland  ] . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] have the lowest drug addiction rates in [LOC Europe  ] . 
These factors make it difficult to convince the general public to view cannabis use as anything other than a social or public nuisance problem . 
[PER Driessen  ] added that any effort to close down all marijuana coffeehouses would likely be strongly resisted because they are widely viewed as a unique part of the [MISC Dutch  ] character . 
He did note , however , that mayors in border cities and in [LOC Amsterdam  ] , The [ORG Hague  ] , and [LOC Rotterdam  ] have been successful in permanently closing coffeehouses that have been found to sell cannabis to minors , sell more than the allotted amount to a single customer , or violate other laws governing the operation of coffeehouses . 
THE [ORG HAGUE  ] 00000814 002 OF 004 As a consequence , the total number of coffeehouses in [LOC The Netherlands  ] has steadily declined . 
( Comment: It is likely that in a few years , only well-established , law-abiding coffeeshops will remain in business . 
End Comment . 
) [PER Driessen  ] added that the police are also paying more attention to combating organized crime groups involved in the production and trafficking of cannabis . 
He said there is now less of a tendency for officials to close their eyes to the back door problem of coffee houses being supplied from illegal indoor marijuana plantations. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Driessen  ] noted that [MISC Dutch  ] and other nationals have formed organized crime groups that control cocaine and heroin distribution in [LOC The Netherlands  ] . 
For example , [MISC Colombian  ] , [PER Surnamese  ] and Eastern [MISC European  ] criminal organizations are active in the country , particularly in [LOC Amsterdam  ] and other major cities . 
[PER Driessen  ] added that organized crime is not of the magnitude or scale that is found in the [LOC United States  ] or other [MISC European  ] countries . 
However , there are large profits to be made in cocaine and heroin smuggling and it remains a serious problem in [LOC The Netherlands  ] with its open borders and large seaports . 
He further explained that the [MISC Dutch  ] have had considerable success with the 100 percent check of passengers coming in from [LOC Suriname  ] and the [LOC Netherlands Antilles  ] , but containerized sea cargoes are a viable alternative for traffickers . 
( Comment: The [MISC Dutch  ] currently only have two machines to x-ray some 8 million containers per year that come into the country ; at best only 50,000 containers per year could be x-rayed . 
End Comment . 
) [PER Driessen  ] attributed recent success against Ecstasy production and export to a combination of good intelligence , a focus on how drug organizations work , and investigations of money and trade lines . 
He added that the [MISC Dutch  ] could improve on their use and application of certain law enforcement methods . 
For example , [MISC Dutch  ] police are currently prohibited from using civilian informants in undercover operations . 
On the other hand , they make extensive use of wiretaps. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Director [PER Walters  ] met jointly with Justice Minister [PER Donner  ] and Health Minister [PER Hoogervorst  ] . 
[PER Walters  ] provided a detailed report on his recent visit to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
He noted that this was his third trip to the country in two years , and he saw marked improvement in [MISC Afghan  ] willingness and ability to eradicate poppy cultivation . 
While the opium trade continues to represent a serious threat to the flagging government of President [PER Karzai  ] , poppy cultivation is down 50 percent overall and down 90 percent in [LOC Nangarhar  ] province from 10 years ago . 
The ministers were accompanied by [PER Arie IJzerzman  ] , Director International Criminal Affairs and [ORG Drugs Policy Department  ] , [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] , ( MoJ ) ; [PER Paul van Voorst  ] , [ORG Head  ] , [ORG Drug Policy Coordination Bureau  ] , ( MoJ ) ; [PER Gert Bogers  ] , [ORG Senior Policy Advisor  ] , ( MoJ ) ; [PER Annemiek van Bolhuis  ] , Director [ORG Nutrition  ] , [ORG Health Protection and Prevention Department , Ministry of Health  ] , ( [MISC MoH  ] ) ; [ORG Senior Advisor Marcel  ] de [ORG Kort  ] , ( [MISC MoH  ] ) ; and [PER Albert Olthof  ] , Chief , [ORG Bureau of International Police Cooperation , Ministry of Interior.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In response to a query about how the [MISC Dutch  ] could further assist the [LOC United States  ] on drug-related issues , the Director noted that the [LOC United States  ] was keen to increase cooperation on interdicting precursor chemicals used in the production of methamphetamines that transit through [MISC Dutch  ] air- and seaports from [LOC India  ] and [LOC China  ] , destined for laboratories in [LOC Mexico  ] and ultimately into the [LOC United States  ] . 
[PER Walters  ] added that the [LOC United States  ] still considers further reductions in the flow of [MISC South American  ] cocaine and heroin into the [LOC United States  ] as a top priority . 
Because of [MISC Dutch  ] interests in the region , Director [PER Walters  ] suggested that the [MISC Dutch  ] and the [LOC United States  ] could further cooperate in this area. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Both [PER Hoogervorst  ] and [PER Donner  ] noted that the [MISC Dutch  ] are working cooperatively with countries around the world to reduce international drug trafficking . 
Health Minister [PER Hoogervorst  ] noted that he had recently returned from a four-day visit to [LOC Colombia  ] and he was impressed by the [MISC Colombians  ] commitment to drug eradication , adding that their political survival depended on it . 
He said that domestic consumption is a serious problem for the [MISC Colombians  ] as well . 
Justice Minister [PER Donner  ] noted that he also had visited [LOC Colombia  ] last August , and he was favorably impressed with the [MISC Colombians  ] anti-drug efforts . 
He noted a disturbing trend in the smuggling of cocaine into [LOC Europe  ] from [MISC Venezuelan  ] ports , THE [ORG HAGUE  ] 00000814 003 OF 004 but was optimistic about an agreement -- currently awaiting ratification -- with the [MISC Venezuelans  ] to boost counter-drug cooperation ; the Surnamese have also requested closer cooperation , especially on controlling transshipment of drugs via air travel . 
[PER Donner  ] was proud that inspections at [LOC Schiphol Airport  ] of aircraft from the [LOC Netherlands Antilles  ] and [LOC Suriname  ] had virtually eliminated those distribution routes . 
He further noted that The [LOC Netherlands  ] , [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC France  ] are working cooperatively on efforts to interdict cocaine coming into [LOC Europe  ] by sea , especially in the [LOC Costa  ] del [PER Sol region.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Donner  ] conceded that progress in other areas of anti-drug efforts has been mixed . 
For example he mentioned that tremendous progress had been made in the [ORG GONL  ] 5-year program to halt the sale , production , and distribution of Ecstasy . 
However , he explained that public opinion and tight resources would make it difficult to mount a systematic attack against indoor marijuana plantations . 
He acknowledged that such plantations are particularly prevalent in the [LOC Rotterdam  ] area ; police are employing imagery and heat-seeking technologies to unearth illegal marijuana growers . 
[PER Donner  ] added that drug tourism from [LOC Belgium  ] , [LOC France  ] and elsewhere is a serious problem , especially in border towns such as [ORG Maastricht  ] . 
He supports the mayor of [ORG Maastricht  ] 's initiative to limit coffeehouses in his city to [MISC Dutch  ] residents in an effort to curb the drug tourism and concomitant crime. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Director [PER Walters  ] reiterated the [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to the statement he and [PER Hoogervorst  ] signed in July 2005 on cooperative steps towards demand reduction and research into the causes and prevention of drug use . 
[PER Walters  ] noted that he would soon send an [ORG ONDCP  ] staffer to meet with [MISC Dutch  ] demand reduction experts to re-energize the initiative . 
He added that he hoped to have a new deputy onboard soon who is an expert in the field of demand reduction . 
[PER Hoogervorst  ] was pleased to hear that the statement would soon be getting greater attention on the [LOC U.S.  ] side and welcomed the exchange among personnel . 
[PER Walters  ] indicated that he wanted to explore joint research opportunities , especially on the topic of long-term drug consumption . 
[PER Hoogervorst  ] provided the group with a readout on a study undertaken last fall on the effects of increasing levels of [ORG THC  ] ( psychoactive compound in marijuana ) on humans . 
He noted that the bottom line of the study was obvious , if you smoke marijuana that is twice as strong , you get twice as stoned . 
[ORG Health Ministry  ] senior advisor , [ORG Marcel  ] de [ORG Kort  ] added that the study found that there were no additional side effects from increasing the levels of [ORG THC  ] in the marijuana that the participants took , simply a greater intensity of symptoms such as increased blood pressure and drowsiness . 
Because the sample size only included 24 male subjects , it is impossible to draw meaningful conclusions from this one study. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Walters  ] also met with MFA Director General for Political Affairs [PER Hugo Siblesz  ] . 
[PER Siblesz  ] was accompanied by [PER Marion Kappeyne  ] van de [PER Coppello  ] , Director [PER Western Hemisphere  ] , ( [ORG WHA  ] ) ; and senior advisors [PER Walter Lok  ] and [PER Alexandra Valkenburg  ] . 
The foreign ministry was keen to hear Walters' readout from his trip to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Walters  ] noted that poppy production is not a cash cow for the average [MISC Afghan  ] farmer and that strides were being made to bring infrastructure and utilities to rural areas to make other crops viable alternatives . 
He added that a military presence alone will not work and that the [PER Karzai  ] government was showing signs that it was expanding its control outside of the capital . 
In most areas , [MISC Afghan  ] forces are leading counter-drug operations with the [LOC United States  ] in back-up or support roles . 
[PER Siblesz  ] noted that Foreign Minister Bot will travel to [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] in early May to assess the situation first hand. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) With regard to anti-drug efforts in other parts of the world , [PER Siblesz  ] commented that efforts are up , but so are the problems . 
[ORG Kappeyne  ] van de [PER Coppello  ] provided [PER Walters  ] with a readout of [MISC Dutch  ] anti-drug initiatives in the [LOC Caribbean  ] and [LOC South America  ] . 
She noted that [ORG GONL  ] is closely cooperating with the [LOC UK  ] , [LOC France  ] and [LOC Spain  ] and wants the [ORG European Commission  ] to step up its financial commitments to counter-drug efforts in the region . 
( Comment: The [MISC Dutch  ] hosted a one-day conference on enhancing [ORG EU  ] anti-drug cooperation in the [LOC Caribbean  ] on February 9 . 
End Comment . 
) In particular , the MFA is interested in exploring and THE [ORG HAGUE  ] 00000814 004 OF 004 eliminating the alliances between drug traffickers , organized crime groups and abusers of human rights . 
[ORG Kappeyne  ] van de [PER Coppello  ] added however , that the [MISC Dutch  ] respect the fact that countries such as [LOC Bolivia  ] seek to preserve their traditional uses of coca , but [LOC La Paz  ] is virtually powerless to do anything about overproduction . 
Director [PER Walters  ] noted that because [MISC Bolivian  ] cocaine is of such a poor quality , little of it makes it to [LOC US  ] shores and it is a bigger problem for [LOC Europe  ] . 
[ORG Kappeyne  ] van de [PER Coppello  ] also noted that the [MISC Dutch  ] have an ongoing project with the [MISC Peruvians  ] to help them identify suspect shipping containers that may contain contraband . 
She said that the Surnamese Minister of Justice was doing an excellent job at counternarcotics control with few resources . 
She concluded that the [LOC Netherlands Antilles  ] , particularly [LOC Aruba  ] , remain a primary focus for [MISC Dutch  ] anti-drug efforts. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: [PER Walters  ] had wide-ranging and open discussions about a variety of drug-related issues with his [MISC Dutch  ] counterparts . 
He complimented the [MISC Dutch  ] on areas where substantial progress had been made , especially in the decrease of Ecstasy coming into the [LOC United States  ] from The [LOC Netherlands  ] , and he made commitments to continue the positive bilateral efforts currently underway . 
For their part , the [MISC Dutch  ] were pleased with the [MISC US-Dutch  ] working relations on drug policy and law enforcement efforts currently underway .
