[PER RICCIARDONE  ] FOR REASONS 1.4 ( B ) AND ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) SUMMARY: Minister of Interior ( [ORG MOI  ] ) [PER Hanif Atmar  ] appealed to the [LOC U.S.  ] not to completely reverse our public opposition to poppy cultivation . 
He feared that doing so would send the wrong message to farmers across [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and lead to a surge in poppy cultivation . 
[PER Atmar  ] charged that the [LOC U.S.  ] was going from one extreme to another in our policy and charged that we were doing so without consultations with us , your friends who are most directly affected by what you say . 
He said it is important to keep eradication as one element of an overall narcotics policy . 
The primary element , he believes , would be the creation of an intelligence-led counternarcotics police force . 
Informed that the [LOC U.S.  ] had ended funding for the Poppy Eradication Force ( [ORG PEF  ] ) , [PER Atmar  ] said the [ORG GIRoA  ] nonetheless must find the resources to continue to use [ORG PEF  ] for some level of eradication . 
[ORG MOI  ] also would use [ORG PEF  ] as a special force to go after narcotics kingpins , and for other special purposes , for example , to offset the shortfalls on elections security and convoy security . 
END SUMMARY <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) In a meeting with Deputy Ambassador [PER Ricciardone  ] on other subjects on August 2nd , [PER Atmar  ] said that President [PER Karzai  ] was caught off guard by the recent announcement by Special Representative for [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] ( [ORG SRAP  ] ) , Ambassador [PER Richard Holbrooke  ] , that the [LOC U.S.  ] will no longer support poppy eradication . 
President [PER Karzai  ] doesn , t know how to deal with this , [PER Atmar  ] said . 
We , d like to advise you not to move from one extreme to another . 
Please don , t make this move so quickly and , when you are announcing policy positions that affect us , your friends , so directly , we expect that you will consult with us in advance . 
[PER Atmar  ] specifically asked that we report these concerns to [LOC Washington.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) [PER Ricciardone  ] reminded [PER Atmar  ] that while we were ending our funding for the [ORG PEF  ] , we had stated publically that we have no objection to any [ORG GIRoA  ] eradication programs it may wish to continue . 
We were simply re-directing our counternarcotics support to more effective purposes , i.e. interdiction of the processing and trade in opium and heroin . 
[PER Atmar  ] agreed that it is important to focus on going after the major narco-traffickers , and requested support to create an intelligence-led counternarcotics police force . 
He stressed that intelligence exploitation and intelligence sharing with the [MISC Afghans  ] are critical tools in forming an effective anti-narcotics strategy . 
But , he emphasized that eradication efforts are also an important symbol of [LOC Afghanistan  ] , s overall anti-narcotics policy and laws that the [LOC U.S.  ] should not dismiss . 
This country must have a credible eradication force to enforce the law , [PER Atmar  ] said . 
He plans to raise this issue during [ORG SRAP  ] , s next trip to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
We welcome focused discussions on this new policy , [PER Atmar  ] said . 
Meanwhile , he urged , Please say nothing that will give our farmers the idea that the pressure is off , or that the [LOC U.S.  ] does not care about poppy cultivation , otherwise we will see an explosion in production , and we do not want that. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) [PER Atmar  ] was passionate about counternarcotics programs , reminding us that he has worked this issue for the last 15 years . 
He said that in order to succeed , [LOC Afghanistan  ] needs technical capacity - with an emphasis on standing up an intelligence-led counternarcotics police force , mentors , and operational funds . 
He urged that training [MISC Afghans  ] to support all levels of counternarcotics , especially in intelligence collection and analysis , would be significantly cheaper for the [LOC U.S.  ] than hiring contractors to do this work. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) We advised [PER Atmar  ] that he could re-direct the 600 member [MISC U.S.-trained  ] and equipped [ORG PEF  ] to more useful immediate purposes . 
Nonetheless , [PER Atmar  ] insisted that he would continue to use [ORG PEF  ] for eradication . 
He would also expand [ORG PEF  ] into a special force designed to pursue major narco-traffickers . 
In order to fill immediate needs , with the poppy harvest now over , [PER Atmar  ] said he would use the [ORG PEF  ] to provide security for elections and for [MISC ISF  ] fuel convoys .
