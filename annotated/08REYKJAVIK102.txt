End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) On Thursday May 29 , at 15:45 local time , an earthquake measuring 6.3 on the [PER Richter  ] scale struck southwestern [LOC Iceland  ] . 
The epicenter of the earthquake was a few kilometers north of the town of [LOC Selfoss  ] , 50 kilometers east of the capital [LOC Reykjavik  ] . 
The earthquake was felt strongly in [LOC Reykjavik  ] and in much of the rest of the country . 
A series of aftershocks followed , but none of the aftershocks registered above 4.0 on the [PER Richter  ] scale . 
On Monday , June 2 , an aftershock of 4.5 occurred , the largest since May 29 . 
According to press reports , geologists at the [ORG Meteorological Institute of Iceland  ] do not expect any more significant earthquakes in the near future . 
The May 29 earthquake was the largest since a magnitude 6.5 earthquake was registered in 2000. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) No one was killed or seriously injured in the quake , but up to 30 people are reported to have sought medical treatment fo broken bones and scratches . 
Property damage was widespread , but light . 
There was some structural damage to residential homes and other buildings , and a handful of old farmhouses were destroyed . 
Numerous residents reported damage to possessions inside their homes . 
Local authorities deemed twenty-four houses in the area to be unfit for habitation several days after the earthquake . 
Some roads in the area were reported to have split open and some bridges were closed to traffic. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) The Government reacted quickly ; Prime Minister [PER Geir Haarde  ] said in a speech in the [ORG Althingi  ] that same day that the government would do everything possible to help those affected by the earthquake and placed a priority on ensuring the safety of the affected area 's residents . 
Minister of Justice [PER Bjorn Bjarnason  ] , who oversees the police and emergency response services , appeared on television to outline the government 's response plan. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) PM [PER Haarde  ] and Foreign Minister [PER Ingibjorg Gisladottir  ] visited the affected areas together on May 30 and met with local officials . 
The PM announced the establishment of a service center to expedite work on insurance claims and the government will allocate ISK 100 million ( $1.3 million ) for unforeseen costs state institutions may incur . 
Observers noted that the civil defense apparatus worked much better this time than the earthquakes in 2000 , and credited lessons learned from that experience . 
The [ORG National Police Commissioner  ] was very pleased with how the national [MISC TETRA  ] communications system ( purchased from [ORG Motorola  ] in 2006 ) worked in the aftermath of the earthquake . 
The only major fault found with the response plans was the lack of the [MISC TETRA  ] system at the [LOC Selfoss  ] hospital , which was sorely needed when cell phone reception was cut . 
In response , PM [PER Haarde  ] announced plans to provide all health institutions with [MISC TETRA  ] communications devices. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) Comment: The [MISC Icelandic  ] Government 's response to the quake is deserving of praise and has been well-received by the public . 
This is welcome news for [PER Haarde  ] and [PER Gisladottir  ] after the economic travails of the last six months . 
Some observers wryly noted that the quake , coming on the [ORG Althingi  ] 's last day of business before summer recess , helpfully pushed the opposition 's criticism off the front pages .
