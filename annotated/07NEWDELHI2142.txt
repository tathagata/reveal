Please see paragraph 6 . 
New [MISC Iranian  ] Mischief ------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER K.V. Rajan  ] , former Secretary of the [ORG Ministry of External Affairs  ] and current Chairman of the Prime [ORG Minister’s National Security Advisory Board  ] ( [ORG NSAB  ] ) , called [ORG Charge May  ] 4 for an urgent meeting in which he told [ORG Charge  ] that he had been invited by the [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] for an all expenses paid trip for “politicians , scholars and commentators.” The list of invitees in a fax from the [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] press section included notorious [MISC America-critics  ] , such as [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
The visit was scheduled for April 28-May 4 , and the [ORG Embassy  ] said the guests would meet [MISC Iranian  ] officials , scholars and would visit “one or two [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear establishment ( s ) .” Reports this week in the “Asian [PER Age”  ] and “The Hindu” indicate the group visited the [ORG Arak Heavy Water Complex  ] and met with Minister of [ORG Energy Parviz Fatah.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Rajan  ] told [ORG Charge  ] that this trip was part of an effort on the part of the [MISC Iranian  ] government to encourage anti-American , pro-Muslim scholars and think-tankers in [LOC India  ] to influence Prime Minister Singh’s supporters to take a more pro-Iranian , anti-U.S. view , and that his presence on the delegation would have handed [LOC Iran  ] a [LOC PR  ] coup . 
In light of his suspicions , [PER Rajan  ] canceled at the last minute , citing a sudden family emergency . 
Following is the invitee list , which [PER Rajan  ] provided to [MISC Charge:  ] -- [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX India  ] Seeks [LOC U.S.  ] Help ------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) To counter this new and worrying effort to reach out to [MISC Indian  ] opinion makers , [PER Rajan  ] proposed a visit to the [LOC United States  ] starting May 14 in his [ORG NSAB  ] capacity for five to seven days to talk to officials , think tanks , and the intelligence community to discuss ways to understand better [LOC U.S.  ] assessments of [LOC Iran  ] . 
He would expect this to feed into [ORG NSAB  ] discussion of [LOC Iran  ] policy options. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Rajan’s analysis of [MISC Iranian  ] intentions to influence PM Singh’s domestic constituencies is deeply worrying and spot-on , and confirms what we have been reporting . 
[PER Rajan  ] also noted stepped up [MISC Iranian  ] funding to sympathetic [MISC Shia  ] clerics . 
The [ORG United Progressive Alliance  ] government is deeply interested in appeasing its [MISC Muslim  ] and [ORG Left Front  ] NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00002142 002 OF 002 supporters , and is concerned about the outcome of elections in [LOC Uttar Pradesh  ] state , where a large number of [MISC Muslim  ] constituents reside . 
We see evidence that [LOC Iran  ] has been buying off journalists , clerics and editors in [MISC Shia-populated  ] areas of [LOC Uttar Pradesh  ] and [LOC Kashmir  ] , doling out large sums to stoke anti-Americanism . 
Now , it seems [LOC Iran  ] is focusing squarely on influential elite audiences in [LOC Delhi  ] , with a view to shaping the debate of India’s [ORG IAEA  ] policy and the nuclear deal . 
ACTION REQUEST: HIGH-LEVEL MEETINGS ------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) To counter this insidious new [MISC Iranian  ] effort , we recommend [PER Rajan  ] receive meetings , if possible , with: -- XXXXXXXXXXXX</pre></code>
