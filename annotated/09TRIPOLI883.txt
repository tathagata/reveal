End Summary . 
A CONFUSION OF MILITARY AGREEMENTS 2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) During a November 2 meeting with [ORG National Security Advisor  ] ( [ORG NSA  ] ) [ORG Muatassem  ] al-Qadhafi , the Ambassador ( accompanied by Pol/Econ chief , notetaker ) reviewed the bilateral agenda , highlighting the clear willingness and intention of the [LOC U.S.  ] to move ahead in the relationship . 
He pointed to the successful , recent signing of the highly-enriched uranium fuel transfer agreement as an example for other areas where we need to see progress , including in the sphere of military engagement . 
The Ambassador reiterated the need for the [ORG GOL  ] to formally approve the 505 agreement in order to unlock training opportunities for the [MISC Libyans  ] . 
Likewise , he explained again the steps that the [ORG GOL  ] must take in order to complete five pending Letters of Offer and Acceptance ( [ORG LOA  ] ) for [MISC C-130  ] related material and services . 
While [ORG Muatassem  ] did not seem to understand where the 505 agreement stood within the [MISC Libyan  ] bureaucracy ( " Isn't that with the [ORG MFA  ] ? 
" he asked . 
) , he expressed a desire to move forward with it . 
Nor did [ORG Muatassem  ] reflect a clear understanding of the five government-to-government agreements , instead changing the subject to that of military equipment sales . 
He complained that the [MISC Libyans  ] were being forced to purchase equipment from [LOC Russia  ] because the [ORG USG  ] had not approved the sale of [LOC U.S.  ] equipment . 
While the Ambassador repeatedly separated the issues of the 505 agreement from that of the [ORG LOA  ] 's from that of the equipment sales , [ORG Muatassem  ] seemed to confuse the three . 
" I do not understand the problem with the sales . 
We still have to take spare parts for the [MISC C-130  ] 's from the black market , " he insisted . 
FORGING AHEAD AND MUATASSEM'S SIX COMPLAINTS 3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [ORG NSA  ] insisted that " we want steps on the ground " to prove that the [LOC U.S.  ] wanted the relationship to move forward . 
The Ambassador reminded [ORG Muatassem  ] of the requests he made during his April 2009 meeting with the Secretary for the creation of bilateral dialogues on [MISC Civil-Nuclear  ] and Political-Military cooperation . 
He informed the [ORG NSA  ] that the [ORG USG  ] was prepared to discuss those initiatives but needed word from the [ORG GOL  ] expressing its own readiness to do so . 
4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Muatassem  ] then laid out a series of complaints that he characterized as " negative signals " that the [MISC Libyan  ] regime had picked up from the [LOC U.S.  ] , which in his estimation , seemed to be statements that the [LOC U.S.  ] did not want to deepen engagement . 
First were the " failed opportunities " for a meeting between [ORG POTUS  ] and the [MISC Libyan  ] Leader on the margins of the July [ORG G-8 Summit  ] in [LOC Italy  ] and then in September at [LOC UNGA  ] . 
Second , he protested the treatment of [ORG UN Permanent  ] Representative [PER Abdulrahman Shalgam  ] by security officials at [LOC JFK Airport  ] ( Ref A ) . 
Third , he informed the Ambassador that he had received complaints from the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Navy  ] that a [MISC Libyan  ] oil tanker was inspected under " special procedures " by the [ORG U.S. Coast Guard  ] when entering the port of [LOC Houston  ] , [LOC Texas  ] . 
He noted that similar incidents had occurred " maybe five times " in the past and that the most recent complaint was registered approximately two weeks ago . 
He suspected that all [MISC Libyan  ] ships raised " red flags " when attempting to dock in [LOC U.S.  ] ports and insisted " this should not be the case . 
" 5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The Ambassador assured [ORG Muatassem  ] that the highest levels of the [ORG Departments of State  ] and [ORG Homeland Security  ] were investigating the [PER Shalgam  ] incident , informing him that senior [ORG State  ] officials would soon meet with [LOC Libya  ] 's Ambassador to the [LOC U.S.  ] to discuss the incident report and procedures that hopefully would help avoid the repeat of such incidents . 
[ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000883 002.2 OF 003 Likewise , he offered to research the charges the [ORG NSA  ] raised regarding inspections of [MISC Libyan  ] ships at [LOC U.S.  ] ports . 
6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Muatassem  ] went on to complain that [ORG POTUS  ] 's September meeting with [ORG African Heads of State  ] specifically from " [LOC Sub-Saharan Africa  ] " was " racist " and particularly discriminatory against [LOC Libya  ] . 
" We see it aimed at us because we are the head of the [ORG African Union  ] , " he said , insisting that [LOC Libya  ] should have been invited to the meeting . 
The Ambassador argued against the logic of the [MISC Libyan  ] charge , reminding [ORG Muatassem  ] that " [LOC Sub-Saharan Africa  ] " is a term used by the entire international community not only the [LOC United States  ] . 
The logic was lost on [ORG Muatassem  ] , who responded , " [LOC Africa  ] is not divided ; it is a single continent . 
" 7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Muatassem  ] 's fifth complaint involved his failure to successfully set up a tent for his father 's meetings during their September visit to [LOC New York  ] and the negative treatment accorded the party while in [LOC New York  ] , including negative media and security restrictions on movement . 
He stated that the [MISC Libyans  ] could not believe the [LOC U.S.  ] reaction to the tent , as it did not pose any sort of security threat . 
He claimed that he did not think pitching the tent in [LOC New York  ] would be a problem . 
In fact , he thought he was respecting [PER A/S Feltman  ] 's request by not attempting to pitch the tent in [LOC New Jersey  ] ( Ref B ) . 
Finally , [ORG Muatassem  ] complained that the [MISC Italian  ] Interior Minister had told him that the [LOC U.S.  ] Ambassador to [LOC Rome  ] had urged [LOC Italy  ] not to send planes to participate in the September 1 anniversary of [PER Qadhafi  ] 's 40th year in power . 
8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The Ambassador reminded [ORG Muatassem  ] of the trajectory of events leading to [PER Qadhafi  ] 's visit to [LOC New York  ] -- July and early August were positive , with the handshake between [ORG POTUS  ] and the [MISC Libyan  ] Leader in [LOC Italy  ] and the launching of the [ORG Human Rights Dialogue  ] ; however , the hero 's welcome that [LOC Libya  ] extended to convicted [MISC Pan Am 103  ] bomber [PER Abdel Basset  ] al-Megrahi poisoned the atmosphere by evoking deep [MISC American  ] sensitivities . 
Arguing that [LOC Scotland  ] , rather than [LOC Libya  ] , should be blamed for [PER Megrahi  ] 's release , [ORG Muatassem  ] exclaimed , " What should we have done -- thrown him into the sea ? ! 
" He claimed that [PER Megrahi  ] 's large [LOC Megaraha  ] tribe had provided the welcome , not the [ORG GOL  ] . 
He insisted that the issue with [PER Megrahi  ] was over now , since [LOC Libya  ] had compensated the [LOC U.S.  ] victims and [PER Megrahi  ] had been returned to [LOC Libya  ] . 
" Let us close the shutter on this , " he suggested . 
The Ambassador retorted that the matter was not that simple . 
MOVING PAST THE " NEGATIVE SIGNALS " 9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The Ambassador emphasized that the [ORG USG  ] wanted to move beyond the events of the past to improve the relationship . 
He urged [ORG Muatassem  ] not to buy into conspiracy theories that the [ORG USG  ] wants to punish [LOC Libya  ] in some way or , beyond that , to subvert the progress already achieved . 
[ORG Muatassem  ] expressed his own commitment to moving the relationship forward . 
The Ambassador conveyed the need for better and more frequent communication between the Embassy and the [ORG NSC  ] in order to maintain a clear picture of the other 's intentions and to express comments or complaints that each side might have vis-`-vis the other . 
[ORG Muatassem  ] suggested that a visit by [ORG POTUS  ] , or at minimum , a meeting between [ORG POTUS  ] and [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] would move engagement forward . 
He noted that the Leader was expected to represent the [ORG African Union  ] at the upcoming [ORG UN Food and Agriculture Organization  ] ( [ORG FAO  ] ) meeting in [LOC Rome  ] but that he was unlikely to attend the [ORG UN Climate Change  ] ministerial in [LOC Copenhagen  ] . 
The Ambassador insisted that we needed to move ahead with the agreements on the ground and to establish a political-military dialogue as next steps . 
He also told [ORG Muatassem  ] that major progress along the lines of what the [ORG NSA  ] was proposing would also have to await the closure of the [PER Megrahi  ] case and a steady period of building trust and confidence . 
10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Comment: While [ORG Muatassem  ] did not seem to be in a listening mode , he did respond positively to the idea of moving forward on the bilateral agenda . 
His aim during the meeting seemed to be focused on his list of complaints -- particularly the tent issue , perhaps signaling that this was an area where he personally bore the brunt of the blame from his father . 
His -- as well as others'-- renewed interest in pursuing a meeting between [ORG POTUS  ] and the elder [PER Qadhafi  ] reflects a lack of understanding of the current state of the relationship , as well as an apparent refusal to understand the impact on the relationship of [PER Megrahi  ] 's return to [LOC Libya  ] . 
It may also reflect [ORG Muatassem  ] 's goal to " achieve " something significant for his [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000883 003.2 OF 003 father in light of the political roiling surrounding [MISC Saif  ] al-Islam 's apparent moving to the head of the succession line . 
We will continue to urge the [MISC Libyans  ] to complete these action requests and to work with the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG NSC  ] and other relevant actors in preparation of the launching of a political-military dialogue .
