CLASSIFIED BY: [PER Jillian Burns  ] , Director , [ORG Iran Regional Presence Office  ] - [LOC Dubai  ] , [ORG Department of State  ] . 
REASON: 1.4 ( d ) 1 . 
( S ) Summary . 
A long-time contact believes it is in the current [MISC Iranian  ] government’s interest to start a military skirmish with the [LOC West  ] to allow the government to exert far greater control over civil society , distract attention from economic woes , and silence [ORG Expediency Council  ] head [PER Rafsanjani  ] . 
He believed the government was using the stand-off with the [LOC UK  ] over the detained [MISC British  ] sailors for this purpose . 
He also claimed that the [MISC Iranian  ] government was restricting the spectrum of political views within policymaking circles . 
Many sides seem increasingly nervous about the danger of an accident sparking escalation . 
End summary 2 . 
( S ) A long-time contactXXXXXXXXXXXX claimed that it is in the current [MISC Iranian  ] government’s interest to fuel a military confrontation with the [LOC West  ] . 
A view shared by a number of [MISC IRPO  ] interlocutors , he said that such a confrontation would allow the [MISC Iranian  ] government to control civil society to the extent seen immediately following the 1979 revolution . 
A military row would also distract domestic focus away from current economic difficulties and unite the people , said the businessman . 
Furthermore , such a clash would silence criticism from [ORG Expediency Council  ] head [PER Rafsanjani  ] . 
3 . 
( S ) Along these lines , the contact saw the March 23 detention of the [MISC British  ] sailors/marines as a deliberate attempt to push the [LOC West  ] into greater conflict . 
He also believed the [MISC Iranians  ] sought out [MISC British  ] for this operation as a less risky stand-in for [MISC Americans  ] , fearing a harsher reaction from the [LOC US  ] . 
4 . 
( S ) The contact also thought that breadth of viewpoints available to policymakers in [LOC Iran  ] was constricting . 
For instance , he claimed that the type of political analyst who could understand the implication of an offer from Secretary Rice to sit at the negotiation table with [MISC Iranians  ] has been sidelined in recent months . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] 5 . 
( S ) Comment . 
The idea that hardliners in [LOC Iran  ] are seeking greater tensions to silence critics , unite the population , and divert attention away from economic and civil society concerns has been reported to IRPoffs by other contacts . 
While it is difficult to discern the truth of the claim , it certainly appears [LOC Iran  ] is using its seizure of the [MISC British  ] sailors to prove its “toughness , ” after facing repeated “humiliations” on the international political front . 
On the other hand , it is likely that [MISC Iranians  ] thought targeting [MISC British  ] rather than [MISC Americans  ] would temper the reaction . 
In any case , many seem increasingly nervous that a blunder on any side could accidentally spark a quick military escalation .
