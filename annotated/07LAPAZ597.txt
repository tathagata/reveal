End summary. ------------------- DISASTER ASSISTANCE ------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) As part of Director of Foreign Assistance and [ORG USAID  ] Administrator [PER Randall Tobias'  ] visit to [LOC Bolivia  ] , President [PER Morales  ] ( along with Amcit [ORG MFA  ] trade advisor [PER Tom Kruse  ] ) met with [PER Tobias  ] , [PER WHA PDAS  ] [PER Charles Shapiro  ] , and Ambassador [PER Goldberg  ] early March 2 . 
[PER Morales  ] thanked Ambassador [PER Tobias  ] for [LOC U.S.  ] natural disaster assistance , saying that this year 's flooding is the worst [LOC Bolivia  ] has seen in 60 years . 
[PER Morales  ] said he is " very grateful " for the international cooperation [LOC Bolivia  ] has received . 
Ambassador [PER Tobias  ] conveyed the sympathy of the [MISC American  ] people for [LOC Bolivia  ] 's flooding victims and informed [PER Morales  ] that two relief planes will arrive March 5 to provide additional assistance . 
[PER Tobias  ] said the [ORG USG  ] is glad to have the opportunity to help [LOC Bolivia  ] in its time of need . 
[PER Morales  ] thanked [PER Tobias  ] for two additional plane loads of assistance and said food rations and donations will be needed for approximately six months in some areas , until [MISC Bolivians  ] can begin to recover from the disasters. ------------------------- BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP ------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) On the bilateral relationship in general , [PER Morales  ] said he wants an " excellent relationship " with the [LOC United States  ] . 
He explained that [LOC Bolivia  ] has a culture of dialogue and that debate is welcome . 
[PER Morales  ] said that while sometimes the press wants to generate conflict between us , he wants the " maximum level of cooperation with the [ORG USG  ] . 
" He acknowledged that the [LOC United States  ] is the most developed country in the world , but noted that the [LOC United States  ] faces environmental challenges , implying that the [LOC United States  ] could learn from the [MISC Bolivians  ] about how to live at peace with nature . 
Ambassadors [PER Tobias  ] and [PER Shapiro  ] offered support for [LOC Bolivia  ] 's goal of a more inclusive society , but [PER Tobias  ] noted that the goal should be placed in the context of a democracy that includes all [MISC Bolivians  ] . 
Ambassador [PER Tobias  ] emphasized the long relationship between [LOC Bolivia  ] and the [LOC United States  ] , which he said the [LOC United States  ] values and wants to continue . 
[PER Tobias  ] told [PER Morales  ] that the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Bolivia  ] have many things in common , and that they should continue to work to find common interests. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Morales  ] asked for aid in creating jobs and improving infrastructure and said he has " great interest " in the [ORG Millennium Challenge Account  ] ( [ORG MCA  ] ) ( particularly for a highway from [ORG La Paz  ] to [PER Pando  ] via [ORG Beni  ] ) and in an additional ATPDEA extension . 
[PER Morales  ] thanked [PER Tobias  ] for [MISC Congress'  ] extension of ATPDEA benefits and said [LOC Bolivia  ] wants commerce with the [LOC United States  ] so it can export goods to the [LOC U.S.  ] market . 
He noted that as developed and developing countries , the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Bolivia  ] complement each other well . 
[PER Morales  ] also acknowledged the United [MISC States'  ] prominent role in international institutions including the [ORG World Bank  ] and the [ORG IDB  ] , and said he was grateful for that assistance . 
[PER Morales  ] said [LOC Bolivia  ] 's macroeconomic stability has improved overall , largely due to increased hydrocarbons revenues , but not enough to create sufficient jobs . 
He also pointed out that his government 's hydrocarbons' nationalization did not include expropriation of property or assets . 
Ambassador [PER Tobias  ] responded by saying that the [ORG USG  ] is working hard to improve lives , create jobs and increase investment in [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
We recognize that a stable economy is key to those goals , he said . 
[PER Tobias  ] also encouraged [PER Morales  ] to aggressively pursue a [ORG MCC  ] proprosal . 
He emphasized that his visit should be read as a strong signal that the [LOC United States  ] wants to work with [LOC Bolivia  ] toward these goals. ------------- SOCIAL UNREST ------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Morales  ] described [LOC Bolivia  ] 's many marches and blockades as largely local problems and accused opposition party Podemos of organizing them and plotting against his government . 
He said that in contrast to protests over the past year , the marches he led prior to becoming president were " apolitical " -- in support of human rights , coca , and other causes . 
He said the [MISC Bolivian  ] people received his marches warmly by supporting the marchers and providing them with food . 
[PER Morales  ] lamented the most violent conflict in his administration to date-- the October 2006 conflict between miners in [LOC Huanuni  ] . 
Before the conflict , [PER Morales  ] said he personally met with miners more than 15 times . 
He said he told both sides that he would work to help them but that they would have to work together . 
[PER Morales  ] regretted that they couldn't , calling the violence the " worst moment " in his administration. -------------- [ORG USAID  ] SUPPORT -------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Morales  ] thanked Ambassador [PER Tobias  ] for [ORG USAID  ] assistance , highlighting alternative development programs in particular . 
He noted the current high prices for [MISC Chapare-produced  ] palm hearts , as well as the [ORG GOB  ] 's desire to export more bananas . 
[PER Morales  ] said [LOC Bolivia  ] wants to export alternative development products , as successes in alternative development reduce coca cultivation . 
He mentioned the importance of a good infrastructure for alternative development projects , and thanked [PER Tobias  ] for [ORG USAID  ] assistance in constructing a road in the [LOC Chapare  ] . 
While stating that the [ORG GOB  ] " wants to maximize [LOC U.S.  ] cooperation , " [PER Morales  ] suggested that [ORG USAID  ] assistance could be more efficient . 
He said that for the cost of one [MISC USAID-constructed  ] soccer field , the [ORG GOB  ] could have built three . 
( [PER NOTE: Morales  ] made this argument previously and Ambassador [PER Goldberg  ] responded via letter to explain that our numbers indicated otherwise ) . 
[PER Morales  ] also mentioned health and education as critical areas for international cooperation in [LOC Bolivia.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) After expressing gratitude for [ORG USAID  ] assistance , [PER Morales  ] indicated that he would prefer that international assistance be donated to the central government , not [LOC Bolivia  ] 's prefects or mayors . 
He said he would like to establish a type of open registry to monitor aid , not for purposes of controlling it but for the benefit of [LOC Bolivia  ] 's development process . 
He said it would be useful to know the amount of [ORG USAID  ] assistance in [LOC Bolivia  ] and what the money is spent on. -------------------- COCA: MORE IS LESS ? -------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Tobias  ] highlighted both countries' interest in close counternarcotics cooperation and acknowledged the [ORG GOB  ] 's interdiction efforts . 
He said that while the [LOC United States  ] remains concerned that any increase in coca cultivation will go to the illegal drug trade , he looked forward to continuing to work through those issues with the [ORG GOB  ] . 
[PER Morales  ] responded by saying his government is serious about fighting narcotics trafficking . 
He said that although he has been accused of being a narcotrafficker , the [ORG GOB  ] policy is " zero cocaine , zero drugs . 
" He said in [LOC Bolivia  ] , " one can't talk about zero coca . 
" At the same time , he said , his government 's respect for the traditional use of coca does not imply unrestricted growth . 
[PER Morales  ] also explained that cocaine is not part of [LOC Bolivia  ] 's indigenous culture. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) In giving Ambassador [PER Tobias  ] some of his personal history , [PER Morales  ] said he was not born a cocalero but moved to [LOC Chapare  ] in 1979-80 after completing his mandatory military service . 
His family , he said , focused on rice production but also grew a few catos of coca on the side . 
Because of globalization and increased international trade in the 1980 's , [MISC Brazilian  ] rice became cheaper than [MISC Bolivian  ] rice , thus damaging his family 's business . 
He recounted that in those years of hyperinflation , people had to sell large bundles of bananas to buy a coke or a beer . 
[PER Morales  ] said eradication with government compensation failed because people became accustomed to being paid large sums of money , " like by a bank . 
" In [LOC Morales'  ] opinion , militarization also failed , as it led to permanent confrontation without results . 
These failures , [PER Morales  ] said , led him to suggest one cato of coca per affiliate to limit production of coca and to prevent conflict . 
He said that when he speaks to the Six Federations ( the main coca labor organization in the [LOC Chapare  ] ) , he tells them if they fail to respect the cato of coca , the [ORG GOB  ] will have to return to militarization . 
He said this serves as a strong deterrent. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Regarding the [ORG GOB  ] 's future plans , [PER Morales  ] spoke in terms of a net reduction of coca and said his government plans to work harder in the [LOC Yungas  ] ( particularly in [LOC La  ] Asunta and in [LOC Caranavi  ] ) . 
He also stressed the [ORG GOB  ] 's desire for closer counternarcotics cooperation with the [LOC United States  ] . 
[PER Morales  ] lamented a lack of progress in the [LOC Yungas  ] but said he hoped the situation would improve . 
He thanked the [ORG USG  ] for its help eradicating in [LOC Bolivia  ] 's national parks , calling counternarcotics a " shared responsibility . 
" [PER Morales  ] , however , also defended the [ORG GOB  ] 's proposal to raise the legal limits of coca production to 20,000 hectares , saying it is " impossible to guarantee 10,000- 12,000 hectares of coca " but that 20,000 hectares is a more realistic goal . 
Likewise , he defended the [ORG GOB  ] 's human rights-conscious policy of " rationalization , " or voluntary eradication , stating that statistics show that the process is more effective if it is voluntary . 
While [PER Morales  ] admitted increased coca cultivation in some areas , he maintained those cases are the exception and not the rule . 
[PER Morales  ] said he knows if he fails , the [ORG United Nations  ] and [LOC United States  ] will be watching . 
In response to Ambassador [PER Tobias'  ] inquiry about how much coca should be approved for traditional uses under ideal circumstances , [PER Morales  ] replied " less than 20,000 hectares . 
" He admitted , however , that the [ORG European Union  ] 's legal demand study was " stuck . 
" Overall , [PER Morales  ] said , he is optimistic about the [ORG GOB  ] 's ability to fight narcotics trafficking , having met its obligations in 2006. --------------------------------------------- A FIRST JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE WITH [PER MORALES  ] --------------------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( SBU ) In an unprecedented move , [PER Morales  ] joined [PER Tobias  ] for a joint press conference following the meeting . 
[PER Morales  ] stated publicly that he was " very happy " with the meeting , and publicly thanked the [ORG USG  ] for disaster assistance ( noting that more would arrive next week ) and general cooperation . 
[PER Morales  ] said the [ORG GOB  ] 's dialogue with the [LOC United States  ] was important to [LOC Bolivia  ] and that it would continue . 
[PER Morales  ] emphasized the [ORG GOB  ] 's " culture of dialogue " and its respect for differences with other countries . 
Additionally , in response to questions about the release of the [ORG INCSR  ] report March 1 , [PER Morales  ] said that he respected the report as an internal evaluation of our government , but that [ORG GOB  ] statistics on counternarcotics progress were very different. --------- COMMENT --------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) In perhaps the [ORG Embassy  ] 's most positive meeting with [PER Morales  ] to date , the president repeatedly thanked [PER Tobias  ] privately and publicly for [LOC U.S.  ] assistance . 
[PER Morales  ] seemed to appreciate the finer points of [ORG USAID  ] operations in [LOC Bolivia  ] and to have a superficial understanding of [LOC U.S.  ] concerns on counternarcotics ( as reflected by his discussion of a net reduction of coca ) . 
On trade , [PER Morales  ] clearly wants an [ORG ATPDEA  ] extension , as further evidenced by Foreign Minister [PER Choquehuanca  ] 's late February trip to [LOC Washington  ] , but again made no mention of a concrete free trade proposal . 
While it seems that [PER Morales  ] may be warming to the benefits of a good bilateral relationship , his willingness to cooperate on the more difficult issues and to deliver solid political , economic , and counternarcotics policies may still be another matter . 
End comment . 
This cable has been cleared by Ambassadors [PER Tobias  ] and [PER Shapiro  ] .
