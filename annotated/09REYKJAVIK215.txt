( U ) In October , prosecutors indicted [PER Catalina Ncogo  ] , an [MISC Icelandic  ] citizen of [MISC Equatorial Guinean  ] origin , on charges of human trafficking , profiting from prostitution as a third party , and drug smuggling . 
The trafficking indictment was the first charge of such a nature in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
On December 1 the [ORG Reykjanes District Court  ] acquitted [PER Ncogo  ] of the human trafficking charge , but convicted her on the charges of profiting from prostitution and drug smuggling. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) [PER Ncogo  ] was accused of deceiving another woman , a compatriot from [LOC Equatorial Guinea  ] , into coming to [LOC Iceland  ] for a vacation and then holding her captive for a number of months . 
The woman was allegedly coerced into prostitution and threatened with physical violence and even death if she protested . 
The district court ruled against the trafficking indictment citing insufficient evidence to prove that [PER Ncogo  ] had threatened the woman and kept her enslaved . 
There are plans , currently on the legislative docket , to amend the existing TIP legislation to lower the burden of proof needed to obtain a trafficking conviction . 
Post 's contacts said that if these amendments were in place already , [PER Ncogo  ] probably would have been convicted on the TIP charges. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) The court did convict [PER Ncogo  ] of profiting from prostitution and drug smuggling . 
The court stated it was clear that [PER Ncogo  ] 's prostitution operation had been extensive and that she had profited from pimping out not only the woman from [LOC Equatorial Guinea  ] but several " other anonymous women " as well . 
[PER Ncogo  ] 's lawyer said that he intends to appeal this decision and take the matter before the [ORG Icelandic Supreme Court  ] . 
The [ORG District Court  ] also convicted an accomplice of [PER Ncogo  ] , an [MISC Icelandic  ] man , who assisted her in her operations by , for example , taking photographs of the prostitutes for an advertisement website. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) [PER Sigdrudur Gudmundsdottir  ] , Director of the women 's counseling center Stigamot , told [PER Emboff  ] that she was pleased an indictment on trafficking had taken place . 
She was also pleased that a conviction had occurred , even if it was not on the charge of human trafficking . 
[PER Gudmundsdottir  ] commented that [LOC Iceland  ] has made considerable progress in its anti-trafficking efforts recently , notably the adoption in March of an [MISC Icelandic  ] national action plan against trafficking in human beings .
