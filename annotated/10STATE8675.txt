[ORG CIT  ] teaches customs agents to recognize WMD-related dual-use items , and this event marked the first time [ORG INECP  ] had delivered any type of training in the [ORG Unite Arab Emirates  ] ( [ORG UAE  ] ) . <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC U  ] ) The [ORG INECP  ] team consisted of [PER Chris Walker  ] ( [ORG DOE  ] HQ ) ; [PER Heidi Mahy  ] and [PER Kevin Whattam  ] ( [ORG Pacific Northwest National Laboratory  ] ) ; [PER Basil Picologlou  ] ( [ORG Argonne National Laboratory  ] ) ; and [PER Kirk Walker  ] ( [LOC Kansas City Plant  ] ) . 
[PER Lisa Meyers  ] ( DOS/Office of [ORG Counterproliferation Initiatives  ] ) and [PER Tyler Hoffmann  ] ( [ORG EXBS Advisor  ] for the [LOC Middle East  ] ) also attended . 
The [LOC Dubai  ] office of [ORG U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ] provided organizational support and attended the course. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC U  ] ) The course began with brief overviews of Weapons and [ORG Mass Destruction  ] and delivery systems ( missiles ) , which occupied most of the workshop , s first day . 
The remaining three days consisted of about three dozen modules covering a range of controlled goods , including machine tools , gyroscopes , ( precursor ) chemicals , and many others . 
The course also featured several practical exercises and &games8 to test the participants , grasp of the material . 
Unsurprisingly , the attendees were not particularly lively during the overview presentations , but they showed strong interest in the commodity presentations and especially the exercises . 
[ORG Dubai Customs  ] brought an x-ray van to the course , allowing both instructors and participants to see how some controlled goods ( that is , the ones [ORG INECP  ] brought along as teaching aids ) look when x-rayed , probably the part of the course that generated the most interest and excitement . 
This was the first time any [ORG Customs  ] agency had provided an X-ray van at a [ORG CIT  ] seminar. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) Attendance on the part of [ORG Dubai Customs  ] varied from about 15 participants on the first day to around 20 or so for most of Days 2 through 4 , plus a few individuals from the training division responsible for organizing the event . 
Most of the attendees work in [LOC Port Rashid  ] , but there were also attendees from the [LOC Jebel Ali  ] , [LOC Cargo Village  ] , [MISC UAE-Oman  ] border crossing , and two representatives from [ORG Dubai Customs  ] , [ORG WMD  ] division . 
Mr. [PER Mohammed Foolad  ] , the [ORG Dubai Custom  ] , s Manager for [MISC Non-proliferation  ] of [ORG WMD  ] , was the senior-most person in attendance and had a good working knowledge about [ORG WMD  ] related dual-use items from his work . 
He leads a special unit of five individuals ( one of whom attended the course with him ) . 
He requested extra copies of the printed course materials and electronic versions of all the [MISC Arab-language  ] materials , which the team provided to him. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Overall , the level of interest was quite good . 
The audience was fairly participatory , and showed a great deal of energy in particular while x-raying the goods and during a wrap-up exercise , in which groups of participants identify pictures of goods from the course . 
Multiple participants stated that cooperation should continue in the future ; time will tell if the sentiment was genuine. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) In a side conversation between Mr. [PER Foolad  ] and [PER Ms. Meyers  ] , he noted that his job is to coordinate WMD- related cases . 
He works closely with the [ORG Dubai General Directorate of State Security  ] on sensitive issues . 
When asked about the [ORG Export Control office  ] , he noted that he works with them , but that they are new to this issue , while [ORG Dubai Customs  ] has been working on this issue for years . 
He noted that the [ORG UAE  ] was developing a computer system that will allow Emirate- level customs offices to communicate with each other. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) CONTD: On targeting , Mr. [PER Foolad  ] noted that [ORG Dubai Customs  ] is stopping [ORG WMD  ] related cargo on their own ( without information from foreign governments ) using their targeting methods . 
They currently use the control lists of the various regimes to target controlled goods , as well as information provided by the [LOC United States  ] , [LOC Germany  ] , and others to target end users . 
They have a handbook created by [ORG Dubai Customs  ] to help their officers physically identify [ORG WMD  ] related dual-use goods , but noted they have had difficulty finding pictures of certain [LOC Wassenaar  ] military- related items . 
He described a case of glass fiber stopped on its way from the [LOC Netherlands  ] to [LOC Iran  ] , as well as some 7075 aluminum . 
He noted that they really need more information on who the suspect end users are , as they could use this information to help them better target [ORG WMD  ] end users . 
He mentioned that they routinely find that the same phone numbers are associated with different companies. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) CONTD: Mr. [PER Foolad  ] explained the serious problems they are facing at their [LOC Cargo Village  ] facility , which is where they handle air cargo shipments . 
He noted that they have to look at over 9,000 shipments a month going to one country of concern ( i.e. , [LOC Iran  ] ) . 
He noted how difficult this is due to the quick time frame , but how necessary given the sensitivity . 
NOTE: Mr. [PER Foolad  ] seemed to take the course , and moreover his responsibilities leading the [ORG WMD  ] unit , very seriously. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 .
