Further , the [LOC U.S.  ] had not communicated the [ORG TSA  ] decision to [LOC Algeria  ] prior to releasing it to the press , which was how the [ORG GOA  ] had learned of the measure . 
The [ORG GOA  ] now had to contend with not only the collective humiliation felt by domestic opinion but also incomplete and inaccurate information regarding [MISC Algeria’s  ] CT efforts circulating in the international press as a result of the story . 
[PER Medelci  ] reinforced the earlier [ORG MFA  ] demarche ( ref A ) formally requesting removal from the list and a high-level [LOC U.S.  ] statement to help correct the record regarding [MISC Algerian  ] cooperation on counterterrorism . 
He pointedly asked the Ambassador to communicate this message to the Secretary and said the [ORG GOA  ] would be monitoring the [LOC U.S.  ] reaction closely . 
End Summary . 
[ORG TSA  ] Decision Ignores Reality of [ORG CT Cooperation  ] --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Algerian  ] Minister of Foreign Affairs [PER Mourad Medelci  ] summoned the Ambassador to the [ORG MFA  ] January 11 to underscore [MISC Algeria’s  ] dissatisfaction with its placement on TSA’s enhanced screening list . 
[PER Medelci  ] began by noting he had had a productive visit to [LOC Washington  ] in early December . 
He had been favorably impressed with both the quality and level of his meetings and had appreciated their focus on bilateral security and counterterrorism cooperation . 
The visit had underscored the strategic importance of our countries’ counterterrorism partnership on this sensitive issue. “We are confident in the direction this cooperation is leading , ” he remarked. “After my visit , I was eager to report my discussions in [LOC Washington  ] to President [PER Bouteflika  ] , meetings which demonstrated that our relations have reached a new level.” <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The discussions in [LOC Washington  ] , he asserted , reflected the reality of the relationship . 
[MISC Algeria’s  ] own struggle against terrorism and its contribution to defeat terrorists were well understood . 
It remained determined to continue that cooperation and reinforce the relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] “We are aware of the risks this threat poses . 
We must remain vigilant and preserve the progress that has been made , ” [PER Medelci  ] said . 
The progress that both sides have made on the ground underscores the confidence and openness of the strategic partnership. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Therefore , the minister said , the [ORG GOA  ] had been extremely disappointed with [MISC Algeria’s  ] inclusion in the [ORG TSA  ] list , as well as the press coverage the decision had generated . 
The decision was intolerable , inappropriate , and inopportune . 
It was a contradiction not only to [MISC Algeria’s  ] ALGIERS 00000039 002.2 OF 004 own progress on security and efforts to fight terrorism , but also to our countries’ counterterrorism cooperation . 
No attacks against the [LOC U.S.  ] had been “signed” by an [MISC Algerian  ] . 
[LOC Algeria  ] had made major progress in recent years on its internal security . 
The domestic security environment had been stabilized , airports were secure , and [LOC Algeria  ] was now an international partner in the fight against terrorism . 
TSA’s announcement had made no mention of any of this . 
Measures Viewed as Discriminatory --------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) This was not just a matter of [MISC Algeria’s  ] inclusion on the list , [PER Medelci  ] said . 
The [ORG GOA  ] protested the discriminatory nature of the whole list . 
Thirteen of the 14 countries listed were [MISC Muslim  ] . 
This sent a message that was inconsistent with President [PER Obama’s Cairo  ] speech , and the administration’s stated policy of outreach to [MISC Muslim  ] communities . 
The decision will likely give further impetus to those who already question the sincerity of the administration’s approach. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [ORG GOA  ] was also disappointed , [PER Medelci  ] continued , that the decision had not been communicated prior to its release and that the [MISC Algerian  ] leadership had to learn of it via the media . 
The minister said the [ORG GOA  ] had initially refrained from making a public statement out of concern for [LOC U.S.  ] relations , but now , due to the extensive press play and sense of collective humiliation among the public , it felt it needed to respond . 
[LOC U.S.  ] Focus on [ORG Air Travel Safety  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The Ambassador said the intention behind the [ORG TSA  ] measures was not to harm or discriminate against any group or country , least of all our friends and partners . 
The intention was to make air travel as safe as possible for all . 
The problem was that , on [MISC Christmas  ] day , a terrorist had gotten through the system . 
President [PER Obama  ] had reacted immediately , ordering reviews of both our watch list system and our air passenger screening measures . 
He had also made clear that our approach would not be static but would evolve as our evaluation of the risk evolved . 
[MISC Algeria’s  ] concerns would be reported in full ; [LOC Washington  ] had already heard the message from Ambassador [PER Baali  ] . 
The Ambassador added that the [LOC U.S.  ] understood well [MISC Algeria’s  ] difficult history with terrorism and appreciated its leadership in the international fight against extremist violence . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] wanted to continue , and build on , our very important counterterrorism cooperation as well as our new partnerships in other areas , including military relations , law enforcement , and economic and trade cooperation . 
Going Forward ------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Medelci  ] said the [ORG GOA  ] shared the desire to continue building our bilateral relationship . 
He reconfirmed [ORG GOA  ] approval for a recent [LOC U.S.  ] request to allow overflights of [MISC EP-3E  ] surveillance aircraft . 
He also welcomed the visit of [ORG U.S. Attorney General Holder  ] to conclude work on a mutual legal assistance treaty . 
The minister underscored as well the GOA’s readiness to assist with the upcoming [ORG Department of ALGIERS  ] 00000039 003.2 OF 004 Commerce trade mission to [LOC Algeria  ] in February and offered to meet with the head of the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation , schedule permitting . 
At the same time , he asked that the Ambassador convey his message on [MISC Algeria’s  ] concerns about the [ORG TSA  ] measures to Secretary [PER Clinton  ] . 
The [ORG GOA  ] shared the [LOC U.S.  ] desire to continue building the bilateral relationship . 
But it would also be watching closely to see how the [LOC U.S.  ] responds to its stated concerns and looking forward to an “equitable solution” . 
[ORG GOA  ] Statement ------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) Below is Embassy’s informal translation of the statement issued January 11 by the [MISC Algerian  ] MFA: The Minister of Foreign Affairs , [PER Mourad Medelci  ] , summoned Monday the Ambassador of the [LOC United States  ] of [LOC America  ] in [LOC Algiers  ] to express the [MISC Algerian  ] government’s strong protest over the decision taken by [LOC U.S.  ] authorities to include [MISC Algerian  ] nationals on a list of countries whose nationals are subjected to specific control measures when arriving and departing [LOC U.S.  ] airports: “In the wake of the decision taken by the [LOC U.S.  ] authorities to include [MISC Algerian  ] nationals on a list of countries whose nationals will be subjected to specific control measures when arriving and departing [LOC U.S.  ] airports , Foreign Affairs Minister [PER Mourad Medelci  ] summoned the Ambassador of the [LOC United States  ] of [LOC America  ] in [LOC Algiers  ] to express the [MISC Algerian  ] government’s strong protests over the unfortunate , unjustified , and discriminatory measure. “This comes after several previous efforts that were deployed , once the [ORG TSA  ] measures were known , by the central government and by our Ambassador in [LOC Washington  ] with the relevant [LOC U.S.  ] authorities.” END INFORMAL TRANSLATION OF [ORG GOA  ] STATEMENT . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The past year has seen developments in important new areas of government-to-government cooperation . 
These include: -- Approval for visits by senior [ORG Department of Defense  ] visitors , including Deputy Assistant Secretary [PER Huddleston  ] and the first by [ORG AFRICOM Commander General Ward  ] . 
These have significantly improved the substance of our mil-mil engagement . 
-- Prompt agreement to allow [LOC U.S.  ] military overflights for surveillance aircraft against [ORG AQIM  ] targets in the [LOC Sahel  ] . 
-- Repatriation of eight [MISC Algerian  ] Guantanamo detainees since 2008 and agreement to cooperate on the return of the remaining [MISC Algerian  ] detainees . 
-- Bilateral cooperation on judicial matters ; a mutual legal assistance treaty and a customs agreement are both ready for signature . 
ALGIERS 00000039 004.2 OF 004 -- Cooperation with our new legatt office , including on a cybercrime investigation that will protect [MISC American  ] citizens from hackers and identity thieves . 
-- Improved police contacts and access for [ORG RSO  ] , which plans to launch an anti-terrorism assistance program this year. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) On the commercial side , the [LOC U.S.  ] exported about [MISC USD  ] 400 million in oil field equipment and services to [LOC Algeria  ] in 2008 and imported [MISC USD  ] 19 billion worth of [MISC Algerian  ] oil and natural gas . 
And our commercial interests are rapidly expanding beyond the hydrocarbons sector . 
[LOC Algeria  ] signed two contracts , totaling [MISC USD  ] 847 million , in December 2009 , to purchase 11 [ORG Boeing  ] aircraft . 
These were presidential decisions , made in the face of heavy [MISC French  ] pressure for [ORG Airbus  ] . 
A [LOC U.S.  ] firm , [ORG Solar Turbines  ] , concluded a [MISC USD  ] 320-million contract in October 2009 with [MISC Algeria’s  ] state electricity company to supply gas-fired turbines . 
[LOC U.S.  ] companies are also competing for politically sensitive security contracts . 
Cogent , a [LOC U.S.  ] biometrics company , is close to signing a [MISC USD  ] 45-million deal to supply the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] with an automated fingerprint identification system but faces heavy competition from [LOC France  ] . 
[ORG Harris Radio  ] is bidding on a contract with a potential value of [MISC USD  ] 500 million to manufacture and supply radios for [MISC Algeria’s  ] defense ministry and signals corps . 
The [ORG Harris  ] and Cogent contracts have significant implications for [LOC U.S.  ] commercial and security interests. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) It is noteworthy that [PER Medelci  ] began and ended this conversation by stressing the importance the [MISC Algerian  ] leadership attaches to continuing bilateral cooperation , especially on counterterrorism . 
But in-between , however , he delivered an unmistakable message that the [ORG GOA  ] feels the [ORG TSA  ] moves are inconsistent with that relationship and that they will be watching closely to see how we respond to this demarche . 
Over the past year , we have had a green light to develop important new ties across the board , from military to law enforcement . 
That light has now turned yellow .
