( [ORG S  ] ) Summary . 
During a June 12 meeting with the Ambassador , [ORG IDI  ] Director MG [PER Amos Yadlin  ] said that [LOC Gaza  ] was " number four " on his list of threats , preceded by [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Syria  ] , and [ORG Hizballah  ] in that order . 
[PER Yadlin  ] said the [ORG IDI  ] has been predicting armed confrontation in [LOC Gaza  ] between [ORG Hamas  ] and [ORG Fatah  ] since [ORG Hamas  ] won the January 2006 legislative council elections . 
[PER Yadlin  ] felt that the [ORG Hamas  ] military wing had initiated the current escalation with the tacit consent of external [ORG Hamas  ] leader [PER Khalid Mishal  ] , adding that he did not believe there had been a premeditated political-level decision by [ORG Hamas  ] to wipe out [ORG Fatah  ] in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
[PER Yadlin  ] dismissed [ORG Fatah  ] 's capabilities in [LOC Gaza  ] , saying [ORG Hamas  ] could have taken over there any time it wanted for the past year , but he agreed that [ORG Fatah  ] remained strong in the [LOC West Bank  ] . 
Although not necessarily reflecting a GOI consensus view , [PER Yadlin  ] said [LOC Israel  ] would be " happy " if [ORG Hamas  ] took over [LOC Gaza  ] because the [ORG IDF  ] could then deal with [LOC Gaza  ] as a hostile state . 
He dismissed the significance of an [MISC Iranian  ] role in a Hamas-controlled [LOC Gaza  ] " as long as they don't have a port . 
" Regarding predictions of war with [LOC Syria  ] this summer , [PER Yadlin  ] recalled the lead-up to the 1967 war , which he said was provoked by the [MISC Soviet  ] Ambassador in [LOC Israel  ] . 
Both [LOC Israel  ] and [LOC Syria  ] are in a state of high alert , so war could happen easily even though neither side is seeking it . 
[PER Yadlin  ] suggested that the Asad regime would probably not survive a war , but added that [LOC Israel  ] was no longer concerned with maintaining that " evil " regime . 
On [LOC Lebanon  ] , [PER Yadlin  ] felt that the fighting in the [MISC Nahr Al-Barid  ] camp was a positive development for [LOC Israel  ] since it had " embarrassed " [ORG Hizballah  ] , adding that [ORG IDI  ] had information that the [ORG Fatah Al-Islam  ] terrorist group was planning to attack [ORG UNIFIL  ] before it blundered into its confrontation with the [ORG LAF  ] . 
End Summary . 
[LOC Gaza  ] Fighting Not [LOC Israel  ] 's [ORG Main Problem  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The Ambassador , accompanied by [PER Pol Couns  ] and DATT , called on [ORG IDI  ] Director Major General [PER Amos Yadlin  ] June 12 . 
Noting reports of fierce fighting between [ORG Hamas  ] and [ORG Fatah  ] in [LOC Gaza  ] that day , the Ambassador asked for [PER Yadlin  ] 's assessment . 
[PER Yadlin  ] described [LOC Gaza  ] as " not [LOC Israel  ] 's main problem , " noting that it ranked fourth in his hierarchy of threats , behind [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Syria  ] , and [ORG Hizballah  ] . 
[PER Yadlin  ] described [LOC Gaza  ] as " hopeless for now , " commenting that the [MISC Palestinians  ] had to realize that [ORG Hamas  ] offered no solution . 
[ORG IDI  ] analysts , he said , had predicted a confrontation in [LOC Gaza  ] since [ORG Hamas  ] won the [ORG Palestinian Legislative Council  ] elections in January <a id='par2006' href='#par2006'>¶</a>2006 . 
[PER Yadlin  ] commented that [MISC Palestinian  ] President [PER Mahmoud Abbas  ] and [ORG Hamas  ] Prime Minister [PER Ismail Haniyeh  ] had become personally close despite their ideological differences , but neither leader had control over those forces under them. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Yadlin  ] explained that both [ORG Fatah  ] and [ORG Hamas  ] contained many factions . 
The [ORG Hamas  ] military wing had been frustrated since the signing of the [ORG Mecca Agreement  ] in January , but there were also many armed groups in [LOC Gaza  ] that were not under the control of either party . 
[PER Yadlin  ] cited the example of the [MISC Dughmush  ] clan , which had shifted from [ORG Fatah  ] to the [ORG Popular Resistance Committees  ] to [ORG Hamas  ] before becoming an armed entity opposed to all of them . 
After May 15 , the [ORG Hamas  ] military wing had sought to export the fighting to [LOC Sderot  ] by launching waves of [MISC Qassam  ] rockets . 
One week later , as a result of [ORG IDF  ] retaliation , they realized the price was too high and reduced the [LOC Qassam  ] attacks. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In response to the Ambassador 's question , [PER Yadlin  ] said he did not think that day 's [ORG Hamas  ] attacks on [ORG Fatah  ] security forces were part of a premeditated effort to wipe out [ORG Fatah  ] in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
Instead , they probably represented an initiative of the military wing with the tacit consent of [PER Khalid Mishal  ] in [LOC Damascus  ] . 
[PER Mishal  ] was still considering the costs and benefits of the fighting , but the situation had become so tense that any incident could lead to street fighting without any political decision . 
[LOC Gaza  ] and [LOC West Bank  ] Separating ----------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The Ambassador asked [PER Yadlin  ] for his assessment of reports that [ORG Fatah  ] forces had been ordered not to fight back . 
[PER Yadlin  ] said [PER Mohammed Dahlan  ] had 500 men and the [ORG Presidential Guard  ] had 1,500 more . 
They understand that the balance of power favors [ORG Hamas  ] , which " can take over [LOC Gaza  ] any time it wants to . 
" [PER Yadlin  ] said he would be surprised if [ORG Fatah  ] fights , and even more surprised if they win . 
As far as he was concerned , this had been the case for the past year . 
The situation was different in the [LOC West Bank  ] , however , where [ORG Fatah  ] remained relatively strong and had even started to [LOC TEL AVIV  ] 00001733 002 OF 002 kidnap [ORG Hamas  ] activists . 
[PER Yadlin  ] agreed that [PER Tawfiq Tirawi  ] had a power base in the [LOC West Bank  ] , but he added that [ORG Fatah  ] was not cohesive. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The Ambassador commented that if [ORG Fatah  ] decided it has lost [LOC Gaza  ] , there would be calls for [PER Abbas  ] to set up a separate regime in the [LOC West Bank  ] . 
While not necessarily reflecting a consensus GOI view , [PER Yadlin  ] commented that such a development would please [LOC Israel  ] since it would enable the [ORG IDF  ] to treat [LOC Gaza  ] as a hostile country rather than having to deal with [ORG Hamas  ] as a non-state actor . 
He added that [LOC Israel  ] could work with a [ORG Fatah  ] regime in the [LOC West Bank  ] . 
The Ambassador asked [PER Yadlin  ] if he worried about a Hamas-controlled [LOC Gaza  ] giving [LOC Iran  ] a new opening . 
[PER Yadlin  ] replied that [LOC Iran  ] was already present in [LOC Gaza  ] , but [LOC Israel  ] could handle the situation " as long as [LOC Gaza  ] does not have a port ( sea or air ) . 
" War with [LOC Syria  ] " Could Happen Easily " ------------------------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Noting [MISC Israeli  ] press speculation , the Ambassador asked [PER Yadlin  ] if he expected war with [LOC Syria  ] this summer . 
Recalling the 1967 war , [PER Yadlin  ] commented that it had started as a result of the [MISC Soviet  ] Ambassador in [LOC Israel  ] reporting on non-existing [MISC Israeli  ] preparations to attack [LOC Syria  ] . 
Something similar was happening again , he said , with the [MISC Russians  ] telling the [MISC Syrians  ] that [LOC Israel  ] planned to attack them , possibly in concert with a [LOC U.S.  ] attack on [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Yadlin  ] stated that since last summer 's war in [LOC Lebanon  ] , [LOC Syria  ] had engaged in a " frenzy of preparations " for a confrontation with [LOC Israel  ] . 
The [MISC Syrian  ] regime was also showing greater self-confidence . 
Some [MISC Syrian  ] leaders appeared to believe that [LOC Syria  ] could take on [LOC Israel  ] military , but others were more cautious . 
The fact that both sides were on high alert meant that a war could happen easily , even though neither side is seeking one . 
In response to a question , [PER Yadlin  ] said he did not think the Asad regime would survive a war , but he added that preserving that " evil " regime should not be a matter of concern . 
Fighting in [LOC Nahr  ] al-Barid Positive for [LOC Israel  ] --------------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The Ambassador asked [PER Yadlin  ] for his views on the fighting in the [LOC Nahr  ] al-Barid refugee camp in northern [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
Although [PER Yadlin  ] was called to another meeting and did not have time to elaborate , he answered that the fighting was positive for [LOC Israel  ] because it had embarrassed [ORG Hizballah  ] , which had been unable to adopt a clear-cut position on the [MISC Lebanese  ] Army 's action , and because the [ORG Fatah  ] al-Islam terrorist organization had been planning to attack [ORG UNIFIL  ] and then [LOC Israel  ] before it blundered into its current confrontation with the [ORG LAF  ] . 
He also agreed that the confrontation was strengthening the [ORG LAF  ] , in fact and in the eyes of the [MISC Lebanese  ] people , which was also good. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Comment: [PER Yadlin  ] 's relatively relaxed attitude toward the deteriorating security situation in [LOC Gaza  ] represents a shift in [ORG IDF  ] thinking from last fall , when the [ORG Southern Command  ] supported a major ground operation into [LOC Gaza  ] to remove the growing threat from [ORG Hamas  ] . 
While many media commentators continue to make that argument , [PER Yadlin  ] 's view appears to be more in synch with that of Chief of General [PER Staff Ashkenazi  ] , who also believes that the more serious threat to [LOC Israel  ] currently comes from the north. ********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy [ORG Tel Aviv  ] 's Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv You can also access this site through the [ORG State Department  ] 's Classified SIPRNET website. ********************************************* ******************** JONES</pre></code>
