( [ORG SBU  ] ) Post briefed [MISC Icelandic  ] MFA [ORG Head of Security and Disarmament Division  ] Thordur [PER Bjarni Gudjonsson  ] March 23 on the President 's budget requests for [LOC Iraq  ] ( ref A ) . 
Asked the current [MISC Icelandic  ] thinking on additional assistance for [MISC Iraqi  ] reconstruction , [PER Gudjonsson  ] referenced [ORG Reykjavik  ] 's recent donation to the [ORG NATO  ] Training Mission-Iraq ( ref B ) and said nothing further was planned at present . 
Referring to the [LOC U.S.  ] decision announced this month to draw down [ORG Naval Air Station Keflavik  ] ( [ORG NASKEF  ] ) he added , " After the last blow we have use for all the spare cash we can find .

( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Comment: The Government of Iceland  ] has long argued that the [LOC U.S.  ] should view its contributions ( e.g. of airlift , peacekeepers , and cash ) to [ORG NATO  ] operations as counterbalancing [MISC Icelandic  ] unwillingness to contribute to the costs of its own defense , e.g. by contributing to the [ORG NASKEF  ] budget . 
We will be watching to see whether the Government now adopts a systematic policy of declining to participate in international endeavors on the grounds that the [LOC U.S.  ] has undercut [LOC Iceland  ] 's ability to act generously . 
In light of its bid to join the 2009-10 [ORG UN Security Council  ] , we predict any reluctance to be an international player will be short-lived . 
End comment .
