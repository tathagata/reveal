End summary . 
Situation on the Ground: [ORG NSF  ] Surrounds [ORG Balata Camp  ] , Patrolling [LOC Nablus Streets  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) As of 1500 local on November 6 , [MISC NSF-led  ] forces are manning six fixed positions around [LOC Nablus  ] , conducting vehicle and foot patrols around the city and surrounding [ORG Balata  ] refugee camp in an effort to persuade militant and criminal suspects to surrender before a November 8 1800 deadline . 
At a November 6 meeting with [LOC Nablus  ] security commanders , [ORG NSF  ] commander [ORG BG  ] [PER Ali  ] told [ORG USSC LTG Dayton  ] that the [ORG PASF  ] are enforcing a total ban on public display or transportation of weapons by anyone not in the security forces . 
[PER Ali  ] said after the deadline expires , the [ORG NSF  ] will arrest all suspects in [LOC Balata  ] who have not surrendered and anyone carrying weapons , using force if needed. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Security contacts say the [ORG NSF  ] detained 11 suspected members of terror cells and criminal gangs overnight November 5-6 and jailed them in [LOC Junayd  ] camp . 
The 11 included [ORG AAMB  ] militants [ORG XXXXX  ] and [ORG XXXXX  ] . 
Both men and a third detainee are long-AWOL GI members , and [ORG NSF  ] contacts say all three will be referred to a joint security disciplinary board to be officially removed from the security forces . 
The [ORG NSF  ] seized a pistol in the operation and in a brief shootout , three militants , one [ORG NSF  ] soldier and one bystander were injured ( none life-threatening ) . 
Future Plans ------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) BG [PER Ali  ] told [ORG LTG Dayton  ] that after operations in [LOC Balata  ] are completed , the [ORG NSF  ] will go into Ein al-Ma' refugee camp and other problem areas on the periphery , and then [MISC Nablus'  ] old city ( al-Qasbah ) , a densely populated warren of stone houses and markets along narrow alleyways . 
He said the [LOC Nablus  ] operation is important in itself , but is tied to a larger [ORG PA  ] security effort that will eventually lead to strong [ORG PA  ] security control over all [ORG West Bank  ] cities . 
Commanders Say [ORG GOI Undermining Progress  ] , Not Coordinating or Sharing Information --------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [ORG IDF  ] entered the [LOC Nablus  ] Qasbah area at 0230 November 6 in an apparent arrest operation , [ORG BG  ] [PER Ali  ] said , causing him to order a halt to all [ORG PASF  ] operations to avoid [MISC IDF-PASF  ] clashes . 
He said the [ORG IDF  ] operation also created an appearance that the [ORG IDF  ] and [ORG PASF  ] are working in tandem or the [ORG PASF  ] cannot provide basic security . 
Liaison ( [ORG DCO  ] ) commander Col [PER Shawki al-Hajj  ] said coordination is better than six months ago , but needs to be improved . 
[LOC Nablus  ] PSO commander [PER Akram Rajub  ] and GI commander [PER Abdallah Kmayl  ] said the [ORG GOI  ] routinely accuses the [ORG PA  ] of failing to act against terror but refuses to give [ORG PA  ] intelligence any names or information the [ORG PASF  ] could use to arrest terrorist suspects . 
[PER Kmayl  ] said [ORG PA  ] intelligence officers have detained and interrogated dozens of suspected terrorists in recent weeks and routinely turn over confiscated munitions and explosives to the [ORG IDF  ] . 
[ORG PA  ] Complains about [MISC IDF-Confiscated Body Armor  ] , [ORG Says Protection Critical JERUSALEM  ] 00002318 002 OF 002 ------------------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [ORG IDF  ] has refused to hand over 80-90 protective vests it confiscated from the [ORG Presidential Guard  ] on November 3 , according to [ORG NSF  ] commander [ORG BG  ] [PER Ali  ] . 
He and Deputy MoI [ORG BG  ] Raji Nijmi say protective vests are no match for the [ORG IDF  ] 's heavy weapons but are critical to protect [ORG PASF  ] arrest teams against well-armed gunmen in [LOC Nablus  ] . 
( [ORG Comment: Security  ] contacts say the vests are a lower protection rating than those worn by [ORG IDF  ] soldiers during routine incursions into [LOC Nablus  ] , can be easily defeated by standard [ORG IDF  ] weaponry , and are closely inventoried to prevent misappropriatio S</pre></code>
