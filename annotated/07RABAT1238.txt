( C ) In response to the points conveyed reftel , MFA Chief of [ORG International Organizations Section Nasser Bourita  ] told us on July 26 that the [ORG GOM  ] takes the accusations of sexual misconduct against its troops in [LOC Ivory Coast  ] seriously , and is sending a high level military delegation to join the [ORG UN  ] inquiry . 
He feels , however , that the [ORG GOM  ] troops are scapegoats for larger problems surrounding the discipline of [ORG UN  ] peacekeepers in [LOC Africa.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Polcouns and poloff conveyed the [ORG USG  ] 's concern regarding the recent allegations levied against the [MISC Moroccan  ] [ORG United Nations Operations  ] in [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] ( [ORG UNOCI  ] ) contingent and urged the [ORG GOM  ] to conduct a full and fair investigation . 
End Summary. ------------------------------- [ORG GOM  ] CONCERNED AND INVESTIGATING ------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Bourita  ] said the [ORG GOM  ] takes these charges seriously and planned on sending a high level military delegation to serve as part of the [ORG UN  ] inquest team in [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] on July <a id='par30' href='#par30'>¶</a>30 . 
The [ORG GOM  ] will take decisive action to punish any individuals against whom accusations are proven . 
The king stressed military ethics when he ascended to the throne and expects breaches by his forces to be quickly , vigorously and transparently investigated at home and abroad. --------------------------------------------- TROOPS SCAPEGOATS FOR LARGER [ORG UN  ] DEFICIENCIES ? --------------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Bourita  ] said , however , the [ORG GOM  ] believes the [ORG UN  ] is scapegoating the [MISC Moroccan  ] [ORG UNOCI  ] troops to show new resolve in the wake of damning reports of smuggling and rape against its peacekeepers in [LOC Congo  ] . 
He protested the sanctions levied against the [MISC Moroccan  ] troops now in [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] stressing that they arrived little over a month ago , while the incidents for which they are being punished occurred over a year ago . 
When reports of malfeasance first surfaced in 2005 , the [ORG GOM  ] removed its troop commander , repatriated him for disciplinary action , and has cooperated with the [ORG UN  ] investigation ever since . 
Collective punishment for the as yet unproven actions of individuals was unfair . 
" How can the entire battalion be punished , " he asked , " when the alleged incidents took place in an area where only 250 [MISC Moroccan  ] troops were stationed ? 
" He further argued that [ORG GOM  ] troops served with [ORG NATO  ] in [LOC Kosovo  ] and received no complaints . 
Comment: He did not refer to problems [MISC Moroccan  ] troops may have had in [LOC Congo  ] . 
End Comment. ------------------------------ Peacekeeping , Politics and PXs ------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Bourita  ] felt that the [ORG GOM  ] troops are caught in a political crossfire between [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] 's President [PER Gbagbo  ] and some [ORG UN  ] members , who oppose [ORG UNOCI  ] and its [MISC French  ] leadership , and are seeking opportunities to discredit the mission ; and [LOC Cote d'Ivoire Prime Minister Soro  ] , who supports [ORG UNOCI  ] . 
As a counter weight to accusations , he pointed to press statements by [PER Soro  ] , who led rebels in the area now under [MISC Moroccan  ] supervision , lauding the [ORG GOM  ] 's troops . 
He also mentioned a signed statement sent by civilians in the [MISC Moroccan  ] zone to the [ORG UNOCI Force  ] Commander stating that the [ORG GOM  ] 's troops had shown " irreproachable behavior . 
" [PER Bourita  ] expanded the scope of his complaint saying that there are larger structural issues regarding [ORG UN  ] peacekeeping command and control in [LOC Africa  ] that contribute to breakdowns in discipline and degradation in troop effectiveness . 
Key issues he focused on were: -units are located far from their commanders with poor lines of communication and little supervision ; -the [ORG UN  ] has no , or insufficient , morale , welfare and supply programs , which forces troops to look for incidentals and entertainment in the areas in which they are posted , increasing the opportunity for unsavory incidents to occur ; -six-month operational rotations ( as opposed to one to two month cycles for [MISC European  ] troops ) with frequent end-of-tour extensions that lead to disgruntlement and breaches in discipline. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) We will continue to urge a strong response to the case as we track the [MISC Moroccan  ] side of the investigation . 
[PER Bourita  ] left the impression that the [ORG GOM  ] will , in fact , conduct a rigorous inquiry with [ORG UNOCI  ] in [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] . 
It remains to be seen what type of punishment will be meted out to troops against whom allegations are proven .
