LIBYA'S STOCK MARKET: SMALL BUT GROWING 2 . 
( C ) [PER Suliman Alshahomy  ] , Chairman of the [ORG Libyan Stock Market  ] , told Ambassador on March 30 that he plans to expand the stock market beyond the eight companies currently listed to eventually include [ORG Jumhuriya Bank  ] and a cement factory . 
He said the state-owned companies currently being privatized ( ref A ) could eventually be listed on the stock exchange . 
[PER Alshahomy  ] expects 20 other private companies in different sectors to be added to the stock exchange . 
At present , only banks , insurance companies , and the [ORG Stock Market  ] itself are listed . 
The stock market is self-regulated , although a draft law creating an independent regulator is being considered by the General People 's [ORG Congress  ] . 
Despite earlier reporting that the [ORG Stock Market  ] falls under the General [ORG Peoples Committee  ] for the Economy ( ref B ) , [PER Alshahomy  ] said the [ORG Stock Market  ] answers directly to the Prime Minister " because it is a company . 
" SOME RESISTERS BUT AL-QADHAFI APPROVED STOCK MARKET IDEA <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Even though some people still resist the idea of a stock market , [PER Alshahomy  ] told the Ambassador he personally explained to [ORG Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi why [LOC Libya  ] needed an exchange to diversify its economy and to move away from a state-owned system . 
[PER Alshahomy  ] noted al-Qadhafi " said o.k . 
" to the plan . 
He said the stock market was even creating television " soap operas " that would educate the public on investing and the merits of a stock market . 
They are also using radio and television to encourage [MISC Libyans  ] to invest in companies . 
DISTRIBUTING SHARES TO POOR [MISC LIBYANS  ] TOO <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The stock market will soon distribute shares in companies owned by the [ORG Social Security Fund  ] to 184,000 poor families in [LOC Libya  ] . 
The stock market will list those companies on a " second table " which will be separate from the " first table " listing the regular companies outlined above . 
The families will be able to receive dividends from the companies but they will not be able to sell their shares for at least three years . 
[PER Alshahomy  ] pointed out this program is separate from the [ORG Wealth Distribution Program  ] ( [ORG WDP  ] ) , which is still being developed . 
He offered his personal opinion that al-Qadhafi 's vision of abolishing the government and distributing oil revenues directly to the public would not happen for a very long time . 
People were used to having some sort of government and they would not want it to go away , he said . 
[LOC U.S.  ] TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WELCOMED <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Alshahomy  ] welcomed the [ORG Embassy  ] 's offer to help tap into technical assistance for the stock market , including from its [MISC American  ] counterparts and experts in the [ORG U.S. Government  ] . 
He noted they had benefited from the advice of an [MISC American  ] consultant in setting up the stock market ( ref C ) . 
He appreciated the recent visit of a [ORG U.S. Treasury Department  ] team in February and invited them back to provide workshops on anti-money laundering . 
He also liked the idea of a visit by representatives of the [ORG New York Stock Exchange  ] . 
( Note: In early March , [PER Alshahomy  ] participated in a conference on investor education organized by the [ORG Financial Industry Regulatory Authority  ] in [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC DC  ] . 
End note ) . <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Comment: The Chairman of the nascent [ORG Libyan Stock Market  ] enjoys high-level support for his efforts to create a modern trading body . 
With only eight companies and a relatively low volume of trade ( around 200,000 dinars , equivalent to 160,000 USD ) , the stock exchange is relatively small . 
However , considering the [MISC Libyan  ] private sector is still quite small , the [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000274 002.2 OF 002 stock exchange is an ambitious start . 
End comment .
