( C ) During a February 18 meeting with the Ambassador , [MISC Polish  ] Defense Minister [PER Bogdan Klich  ] said there is a good political framework for continued [MISC U.S.-Polish  ] defense cooperation , and noted Under Secretary Tauscher’s February 8 visit had been a very successful one . 
[PER Klich  ] said he does not expect anything will happen to undermine that solid foundation . 
He added that the bilateral supplemental [ORG SoFA  ] , signed December 11 , provides a strong legal framework for defense ties . 
The [ORG SoFA  ] ratification vote in the [ORG Sejm  ] ( the lower house of Parliament ) was overwhelmingly in favor , and [ORG Senate  ] approval would also come quickly . 
( [ORG Note:  ] The [ORG Senate  ] voted 88-1 in favor of [ORG SOFA  ] ratification later on February 18 . 
) [PER Klich  ] said President [PER Kaczynski  ] would sign the [ORG SoFA  ] ratification bill quickly . 
HOPING FOR PATRIOTS IN APRIL ---------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Klich  ] said [LOC Poland  ] has a strong desire to see the fruits of bilateral defense cooperation , and he highlighted the political importance of an early first rotation in [LOC Poland  ] of the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Patriot  ] battery . 
He said [LOC Poland  ] hopes the first rotation will occur in April . 
The Ambassador said the [LOC United States  ] wants the rotation to be viewed as a bilateral success . 
In answer to Klich’s questions about timing , the [PER Ambassader  ] said the [LOC United States  ] has said the first rotation would take place within 90 days of [ORG SOFA  ] ratification . 
He said a more precise time frame will be determined at the last bilateral planning meeting for the [MISC Patriot  ] rotation , which will take place in the first week in March . 
MILITARY FACILITIES FOR ALTERNATIVE [LOC U.S.  ] PRESENCES --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Klich  ] called for talks on other forms of an enhanced [LOC U.S.  ] security presence in [LOC Poland  ] . 
He said he had authorized Deputy Defense Minister [PER Stanislaw Komorowski  ] and [PER ChoD  ] [PER Franciszek Gagor  ] to take part in such talks . 
[PER Klich  ] highlighted [MISC Polish  ] interest in all of the options presented by [ORG DOD A/S  ] Vershbow at the October High Level Defense Group discussions: [MISC F-16s  ] , C-130’s , as well as “stable , not temporary” special operations forces . 
When asked , [PER Klich  ] confirmed that the GoP is particularly interested in [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC F-16  ] rotations . 
Speaking personally , he said he also had a strong interest in a special operations force presence , since he had signed a bilateral special operations cooperation agreement with Secretary [PER Gates  ] a year ago . 
[PER ChoD Gagor  ] added that the biggest multilateral exercise [LOC Poland  ] is hosting this year , “Jackal Stone 10 , ” will feature special operations forces . 
[PER Klich  ] added that as part of the first in-depth infrastructure review in postwar [LOC Poland  ] , the [ORG Defense Ministry  ] had decided to close 20% of defense facilities , but would be &saving8 three complexes for [LOC U.S.  ] forces . 
GETTING THE WORD OUT ON DEFENSE COOPERATION ------------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The Ambassador noted that the bilateral agenda for defense cooperation is a full one , and both governments should work together to inform public opinion about the many useful exchanges under way . 
[PER Klich  ] strongly agreed that [ORG Defense Ministry  ] and [MISC Embassy  ] staff should follow up in this area . 
Deputy Defense Minister [PER Komorowski  ] added that if A/S Vershbow visits [LOC Warsaw  ] in the coming months , it might be a good occasion to do some joint public diplomacy work about planning for other forms of an enhanced [LOC U.S.  ] security presence in [LOC Poland  ] . 
( [ORG Note: Amb  ] . 
Vershbow’s planned mid-March trip has been postponed . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) COMMENT: Klich’s emphasis on a hoped-for April arrival WARSAW 00000110 002 OF 002 of the first [MISC Patriot  ] battery is consistent with other government statements and press leaks that signal a decision to focus on the timing of the first deployment , as opposed to other aspects of it . 
In that regard , [PER Klich  ] did not repeat government appeals that [MISC Patriot  ] rotations be integrated into the [MISC Polish  ] air defense system and include “live” missiles , as he did in a meeting the previous week with Under Secretary [PER Tauscher  ] . 
The emphasis on the timing of the first deployment corresponds with developments in the presidential race , and Foreign Minister [PER Sikorsky  ] , s active candidacy for the [ORG Civic Platform  ] nomination .
