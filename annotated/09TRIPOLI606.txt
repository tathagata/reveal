REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Summary:  ] During a year of regional prominence for the [LOC Jamahiriya  ] , [LOC Libya  ] has nevertheless continued to create bilateral rifts with previously close countries - namely [LOC Switzerland  ] and [LOC Tunisia  ] . 
In the [MISC Swiss  ] case , the [PER Qadhafi  ] family was insulted when the [LOC Geneva  ] police had the " audacity " to arrest one of the Leader 's sons ( [LOC Hannibal  ] ) for allegedly beating his household staff . 
While the situation with the [MISC Swiss  ] seems to be slowly nearing a possible resolution , [LOC Libya  ] is now threatening its relationship with [LOC Tunisia  ] by levying a " tax " on incoming trucks , an action which reportedly resulted from a " personal " slight to the Leader by President [PER Ben Ali  ] . 
End Summary . 
2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Newly-arrived [MISC Swiss  ] Charge d'Affaires , [PER Stefano Lazaratto  ] , informed the Ambassador and Pol/Econ Chief July 28 that he was hoping to be able to remain in his position but that he had not yet been informed by the [ORG GOL  ] that he would be allowed to stay . 
[PER Lazaratto  ] , who arrived ten days ago , reported that [LOC Bern  ] was fairly optimistic that a resolution to the [MISC Swiss-Libyan  ] imbroglio was now within possible reach ( reftel ) . 
According to [PER Lazaratto  ] , the [MISC Swiss  ] are waiting for an invitation from [LOC Libya  ] for President [PER Pascal Couchepin  ] to come to [LOC Libya  ] to resolve the issue personally , perhaps during a meeting with the Leader . 
[PER Lazaratto  ] expects the situation to be resolved after the [MISC Swiss  ] president offers a formal apology to [PER Qadhafi  ] , although he and other [MISC Swiss  ] officials are acutely aware that what they may interpret as a final agreement with the [MISC Libyans  ] may be subject to change even after the [MISC Swiss  ] leader 's possible arrival in [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Proving that an offense or insult to the Leader -- regardless of how minor -- is worthy of a strong reaction , [PER Qadhafi  ] has also apparently decided to provoke an escalating bilateral crisis between [LOC Libya  ] and [LOC Tunisia  ] . 
Contacts tell us that the problem began when [MISC Tunisian  ] President [PER Zine el Abidine Ben Ali  ] did not attend the Community of [LOC Sahel  ] and [LOC Saharan States  ] ( [LOC CEN-SAD  ] ) [ORG Summit  ] May 28-30 , hosted by [PER Qadhafi  ] in [LOC Sabratha  ] . 
The [ORG GOL  ] , insulted at the slight , ordered that stiff fees be levied on the hundreds of [MISC Tunisian  ] trucks crossing the [MISC Tunisian-Libyan  ] border everyday , causing this important trade to come to an almost dead halt . 
The " tax " is reportedly 250 dinars per truck ( approximately 200 USD ) . 
[PER Ben Ali  ] was reportedly incensed by the action , especially given that it is an election year . 
The [MISC Tunisians  ] insist that [LOC Libya  ] 's unfriendly actions also contravene longstanding bilateral agreements on border issues . 
The action has prompted [LOC Tunisia  ] to withdraw Ambassador [PER M. Mohamed Brahem  ] , who took up his post in January 2005 . 
[PER Brahem  ] will reportedly depart on an extended vacation , leaving open the possibility of his return should the disagreement be resolved . 
Neither the [MISC Tunisians  ] nor the [MISC Libyans  ] have publicly signaled a formal rupture of relations , although there is considerable anger on the side of the [MISC Libyans  ] , who understand the true meaning of the ambassador 's departure . 
4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Comment:  ] The two cases reflect the Leader 's track record of blowing events out of proportion no matter what the political cost , especially when an offense has been caused to himself or his family ( e.g. , his continuing battle with [ORG Saudi King Abdullah  ] who openly snubbed him at an [ORG Arab League Summit  ] several years ago ) . 
We understand that the decision to take action against the [MISC Tunisians  ] would not have been made unless condoned by [PER Qadhafi  ] himself , who takes a close , hands-on and personal interest in [LOC Libya  ] 's dealings with [LOC Tunisia  ] and [LOC Egypt  ] .
