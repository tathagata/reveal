Cretz  ] , Ambassador , [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy - [LOC Tripoli  ] , [LOC U.S.  ] Dept of State . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: The Ambassador had a wide-ranging discussion on [MISC African  ] issues with [LOC Libya  ] 's senior [LOC Africa  ] expert . 
Topics included: [LOC Somalia  ] ( [LOC Libya  ] urged quick [ORG UNSC  ] action to bolster the [ORG Transitional Federal Government  ] and blunt the current al-Shabaab offensive ) ; [PER Chad/Sudan  ] ( [LOC Libya  ] blamed both sides for incursions in violation of the recent agreement ) ; [LOC Mauritania  ] ( no one wants former President [PER Abdellahi  ] back , opposition to allowing military leaders to stand for election is unreasonable and the international community should send election observers ) ; [LOC Madagascar  ] ( [LOC Libya  ] has not recognized [PER Andry Rajoelina  ] or his government , which plan to hold elections next spring ) ; and the upcoming [LOC AU Summit  ] ( to be held in the [MISC Libyan  ] town of [LOC Sirte  ] ) . 
End summary . 
[ORG SOMALIA: LIBYA URGES UNSC ACTION  ] 2 . 
( C ) The Ambassador met with one of [LOC Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi 's trusted [LOC Africa  ] hands , MFA Secretary for [MISC African Affairs  ] Dr. [PER Ali Treiki  ] , at the latter 's request on May 18 . 
[PER Treiki  ] 's focus was on the evolving situation in [LOC Somalia  ] - he interrupted his conversation with the Ambassador to take a call from [MISC Somali  ] President [PER Sheikh Sharif  ] , who provided an update on the situation and asked for [LOC Libya  ] 's help . 
Describing the situation as " very bad and really dangerous " , [PER Treiki  ] said [LOC Libya  ] was consulting with [ORG AU Commisioner for Peace and Security Ramtane Lamamra  ] , who was in [LOC Tripoli  ] for consultations . 
[LOC Libya  ] 's Ambassador to [LOC Asmara  ] had conveyed a message to the [MISC Eritrean  ] government ( [ORG NFI  ] ) , and had been assured that [LOC Eritrea  ] was not/not providing material or other support to al-Shabaab . 
According to [PER Treiki  ] , officials in [LOC Asmara  ] claimed that because [LOC Eritrea  ] was not a [MISC Muslim  ] country , there was no logical reason for it to support [MISC Islamic  ] fundamentalists in [LOC Somalia  ] . 
3 . 
( C ) Offering that [ORG AU  ] peacekeeping forces in [LOC Somalia  ] were " insufficient " , [PER Treiki  ] repeatedly pressed the Ambassador as to what could be done to shore up [LOC Somalia  ] 's [ORG Transitional Federal Government  ] ( [ORG TFG  ] ) and blunt the current al-Shabaab offensive . 
[LOC Libya  ] asked the [ORG AU Commission for Peace and Security  ] to convene an emergency meeting on May 19 to discuss the situation , but believes [ORG UN Security Council  ] action is warranted and necessary . 
Noting that [LOC Libya  ] is ready and eager to cooperate with potential [ORG UNSC  ] efforts on [LOC Somalia  ] , he urged the [LOC U.S.  ] to consult with [MISC P-5  ] counterparts and act quickly . 
When pressed , [PER Treiki  ] was unclear on whether [LOC Libya  ] advocated a Presidential Statement or a [ORG UNSCR  ] . 
CHAD/SUDAN: [MISC LIBYAN  ] ENVOYS IN KHARTOUM AND [LOC CHAD  ] 4 . 
( C ) [PER Treiki  ] said [LOC Libya  ] blamed both [LOC Khartoum  ] and N 'd jamena for the quick collapse of the recent agreement on non-interference between the two . 
[PER Treiki  ] was to travel to [LOC Khartoum  ] May 19 to " deliver a message " ( [ORG NFI  ] ) to President [PER Bashir  ] . 
He said another [MISC Libyan  ] envoy ( [ORG NFI  ] ) was to travel in parallel to N 'd jamena with a message for President [PER Deby  ] . 
Conceding that recent cross-border attacks into [LOC Chad  ] from [LOC Sudan  ] had not been helpful , he noted that both [PER Bashir  ] and [PER Deby  ] were expected to be at the [LOC AU Summit  ] in [LOC Sirte  ] , [LOC Libya  ] July 1-3 , which could afford an opportunity for positive engagement . 
MAURITANIA: FOCUS ON JUNE ELECTIONS 5 . 
( C ) On [LOC Mauritania  ] , [PER Treiki  ] said he had accompanied [LOC Senegal  ] 's President [PER Abdoulaye Wade  ] and [ORG AU Commisioner for Peace and Security Lamamra  ] on joint mediation visit to [LOC Nouakchott  ] last week . 
The delegation met with deposed President [PER Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdellahi  ] , junta leader-turned-presidential candidate [PER Muhammad Ould Abdelaziz  ] and opposition leader [PER Ahmed Ould Daddah  ] , as well as members of [MISC Parliament  ] and the opposition . 
He said that agreement had been reached on the contours of an interim national government that would include members of the opposition . 
Claiming that " 90 percent of the [LOC Parliament  ] " and " a clear majority of the people " were in favor of the coup , he flatly said the return to power of former President [PER Abdellahi  ] was impossible . 
" The reality of the situation - despite the fact that coups are bad - is that no one wants the old president back " , he said . 
6 . 
( C ) [PER Treiki  ] said the exigent issue now was getting through national elections , currently scheduled for June 6 . 
Based on conversations during the delegation 's visit , [LOC Libya  ] and the [ORG AU  ] believed the opposition must be " more cooperative " and abandon its objection to allowing military leaders to stand as candidates . 
Characterizing the opposition leaders' position as " unreasonable " , he claimed the [MISC Mauritanian  ] constitution permitted any military officer or judge who had resigned 45 days or more before a poll to be eligible for election . 
( Note: We defer to [LOC Nouakchott  ] on whether that is indeed the case . 
End note . 
) [LOC Mauritania  ] 's coup leaders had assured [LOC Libya  ] and [ORG AU  ] members that it would accept all delegations of election observers . 
[PER Treiki  ] said the [ORG AU  ] , [ORG Arab Maghreb Union  ] , [ORG Arab League  ] , [ORG European Union  ] and [ORG Community  ] of [LOC Sahel-Saharan States  ] ( [MISC CEN-SAD  ] ) would send observers and encouraged the [LOC U.S.  ] to do so as well . 
[LOC MADAGASCAR  ] & [ORG AU SUMMIT: LIBYA  ] HAS NOT RECOGNIZED RAJOELINA GOVERNMENT ; [LOC SIRTE  ] THE VENUE FOR [ORG AU MEETING  ] 7 . 
( C ) Regarding the May 17 meeting in [LOC Tripoli  ] between [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi and [LOC Madagascar  ] 's would-be president , [PER Andry Rajoelina  ] , [PER Treiki  ] confirmed that [LOC Libya  ] had observed [ORG AU  ] consensus and not/not recognized [PER Rajoelina  ] 's government . 
Coverage of the visit in [MISC Libyan  ] state-owned media was muted - RajoelinaQ pointedly referred to only by name or as " the man who declared himself the head of the [ORG High Transitional Presidency  ] " , and was not described as the president . 
According to [PER Treiki  ] , [PER Rajoelina  ] told al-Qadhafi he would hold elections in [LOC Madagascar  ] in April/May 2010 . 
On the upcominQummit , [PER Treiki  ] said the venue would be the [MISC Libyan  ] town of [LOC Sirte  ] ( media reports and an [ORG AU  ] press release subsequentlQirmed that ) . 
Members of the [ORG AU PermReps Committee  ] will meet June 24-26 , the [ORG Executive Council  ] ( Ministerial ) will convene June 28-30 , and the Assembly ( summit ) will meet July 1-3 . 
Delegations , which the [MISC Libyans  ] have asked not exceed 10 persons , are expected to stay in [LOC Sirte  ] and the [ORG GOL  ] will stage special flights to/from [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
Separately , [LOC UK  ] diplomats said the [ORG FCO  ] 's Minister for [MISC African Affairs  ] , [PER Lord Malloch-Brown  ] , will attend the [LOC AU Summit  ] .
