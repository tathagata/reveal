( C ) The [MISC London-based  ] [ORG Financial Times  ] reported on June 15 that President [PER Mubarak  ] intends to name a Vice President - a step he has refused to take throughout his 24 year tenure as President - after the September Presidential elections . 
We reached out to the reporter who filed the story , who confirmed to us that [PER Soliman Awad  ] , a key aide to [PER Mubarak  ] and his official spokesman , had made the remark , on-the-record , over dinner with her and several [MISC British  ] colleagues . 
Most contacts we have spoken with were unaware of and surprised by the news , with a number expressing skepticism , noting that the timing of such a revelation and the means of conveying it , were unorthodox , at the least . 
Of those who gave the story credence , all agreed that Intelligence Chief General [PER Omar Soliman  ] was the most likely to be named to the post . 
We do not doubt that [PER Mubarak  ] 's aide made this statement to the [MISC British  ] journalists . 
However , given the sensitive and even historic nature of such news , we doubt it was intended as an official and on-the-record statement , and though revelatory , it could still be subject to change . 
End summary. --------------- A [MISC British  ] Scoop --------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [ORG Financial Times  ] reported on June 15 that President [PER Mubarak  ] intends to name a Vice President - a step he has refused to take throughout his 24 year tenure as President - after the September Presidential elections . 
The story , filed from [LOC Cairo  ] by [MISC London-based  ] correspondent [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , cited as her source Presidential [PER Spokesman Soliman Awad  ] . 
By mid-afternoon on June 15 , no other media comment on the story , and no mention whatsoever in the [MISC Egyptian  ] media had appeared. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG PA  ] officer contacted [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , who was by then back in [LOC London  ] , for an informal clarification . 
In response , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] advised that [PER Awad  ] had made the assertion over dinner with her and several [MISC British  ] colleagues , and had made clear that his statement was for the record . 
[PER Awad  ] also told the group , she added , that [PER Mubarak  ] will announce his intention to seek reelection soon after the electoral regulations being debated by parliament ( reftel ) are passed , though it was not clear if this second statement was for the record. --------------------------------------- [MISC Egyptians  ] Surprised , Bemused , Skeptical --------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Embassy contacts we approached for reaction were , in turns , surprised , bemused , and skeptical of the report . 
Of eight contacts we spoke with , only one , a prominent newspaper publisher and activist , had heard of the story . 
Most agreed that the timing of such an announcement , and the means selected to convey it , were strange . 
Usually , announcements of this magnitude would be made by the President himself , in a carefully chosen venue , several noted . 
The fact that the story had not appeared in any other media led many to doubt its credibility . 
Of those inclined to give the story credence , all agreed that the most likely candidate to be appointed to the post was General [PER Omar Soliman  ] , Director of the [MISC Egyptian  ] General Intelligence Service ( EGIS ) . <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Contacts we spoke with , most of whom would fall into the " reformist/opposition " category , disagreed on whether such an announcement if true , constituted good news , bad news , or neither . 
[LOC XXXXXXXXXXX  ] , Director of [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and a member of the [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , told us " it makes no difference one way or another . 
There are no signs the regime is changing . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Hafez Abou Seada  ] , Secretary-General of the [MISC Egyptian  ] Organization for [ORG Human Rights  ] , expressed an opposite view: " At least the country would not be left in the dark like this , not knowing where we are going . 
It would mean at least a transitional period with someone like ( Intelligence Chief ) [PER Omar Soliman  ] until the issue of presidential elections and free parliamentary elections are established . 
As it is now , we lack a sense of direction . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Rifa'at Said  ] , President of the leftist [ORG Tagammu' Party  ] , told us the fact that such information would be conveyed by the [ORG Financial Times  ] , through the President 's spokesman , struck him as very odd , noting that he has not heard any of his senior contacts in the ruling [ORG National Democratic Party  ] breathe a word of such a plan . 
He speculated that the paper might be misinterpreting or distorting the spokesman 's words. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) In the past two years , a variety of internal and external factors , as well as [PER Mubarak  ] 's advancing age and questions about his health , have made presidential succession a core national issue . 
The office of the Vice President , vacant since 1981 , has been central to the discussion , as it was the springboard by which two of [LOC Egypt  ] 's three Presidents since 1952 came to office . 
In this context , news that [PER Mubarak  ] will soon break with his long-standing refusal to name a deputy would be historic. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) We judge [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] a serious and seasoned journalist , very unlikely to fabricate such a story or " misunderstand " an important point made by the president 's spokesman . 
That said , we agree with contacts who found the means of conveying such important news - from a presidential aide in an exclusive to a foreign newspaper - very strange , and we do not consider this a definitive or official announcement . 
We believe there may have been some misunderstanding about the ground rules for the conversation and that [PER Awad  ] may have thought this remark off the record . 
If [PER Awad  ] made such remarks without the advice and consent of the President , he could find himself in deep trouble. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Speculation that EGIS Chief [PER Omar Soliman  ] would be the most likely candidate for the VP job comes as no surprise . 
[PER Soliman  ] , one of [PER Mubarak  ] 's closest advisors , has had an increased public profile in recent years with his role as [LOC Egypt  ] 's point man on the [MISC Israeli Palestinian  ] conflict . 
Though he does not have a domestic constituency per se , he enjoys a reputation for being uncorrupt , in stark contrast to many , if not most , ministers and ruling party figures . 
Though many remain convinced of the existence of a master plan to install [PER Gamal Mubarak  ] as his father 's successor , his appointment as Vice President in September would be almost impossible in the current context , given very palpable public animosity to the concept , and given that [PER Gamal  ] and his father continue to deny that any " bequeathment of office " will take place .
