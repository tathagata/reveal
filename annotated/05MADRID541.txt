Classified By: Charge d'Affaires [PER J. Robert Manzanares  ] ; reasons 1.4 ( B ) and ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary . 
After a tumultuous year in our bilateral relations with [LOC Spain  ] , the Mission is considering how best to establish a more productive relationship with the [ORG Zapatero  ] administration . 
The [ORG GOS  ] scored early political points with the [MISC Spanish  ] public by withdrawing [MISC Spanish  ] forces from [LOC Iraq  ] , attacking [ORG USG  ] policy in [LOC Iraq  ] , and breaking with the previous government 's emphasis on transatlantic relations . 
More recently , however , the [ORG GOS  ] has recognized the high domestic and international cost of its confrontational approach towards the [ORG USG  ] and has made clear its desire to improve bilateral ties . 
We have insisted that such sentiments be backed up with actions , and the [ORG GOS  ] responded by agreeing to participate in a [LOC PRT  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , providing funds for the [LOC Iraq  ] elections , agreeing to train [MISC Iraqi  ] security officials in [LOC Spain  ] , and toning down their criticism of [ORG USG  ] foreign policy . 
In return for these gestures , the [ORG Zapatero Government  ] is hoping for [ORG USG  ] acknowledgement that ties are on the mend , preferably through the positive optics that would be generated by high-level meetings in [LOC Washington.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) We believe it makes sense to lock in the gains of the last two months by publicly recognizing [LOC Spain  ] 's positive steps , as we did through the meeting between Secretary [PER Rumsfeld  ] and [PER DefMin Bono  ] in [LOC Nice  ] . 
We also suggest moving forward on areas of particular bilateral importance , such as counter-terrorism cooperation . 
Minister of Interior [PER Jose Antonio Alonso  ] and Minister of Justice [PER Juan Fernando Lopez Aguilar  ] have both requested meetings in [LOC Washington  ] in early 2005 for counter-terrorism discussions with [ORG USG  ] counterparts and the country team strongly supports these requests . 
Similarly , we should encourage stronger military to military relations and commercial ties . 
Important differences remain with the [ORG Zapatero  ] government , including his overtures to [LOC Cuba  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Spain  ] 's continuing refusal to allow [MISC Spanish  ] forces assigned to [ORG NATO  ] commands to participate in operations in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
We have also been frustrated by the sometimes erratic and uncoordinated nature of the Socialist administration , as demonstrated by the confusion surrounding [PER DefMin Bono  ] 's recent visit to [LOC Venezuela.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Despite these lingering concerns , we believe the time is right for calibrated re-engagement with the [ORG GOS  ] in the hope that we can establish a greater degree of influence on [ORG GOS  ] policy and , when possible , steer them towards a more positive course . 
[ORG Zapatero  ] 's domestic position has strengthened over the last year and his approval rating of 63% suggests we will be dealing with his government for several years to come , so it is in our interest to improve the working relationship with him . 
Alternatively , [ORG USG  ] snubs could trigger a nationalist backlash in [LOC Spain  ] and encourage [ORG Zapatero  ] to withhold cooperation with [ORG USG  ] initiatives . 
End Summary. //A Tough Year// <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The first ten months of the [ORG Zapatero  ] administration have proven among the most difficult periods in [MISC U.S.-Spanish  ] relations in many years . 
Throughout the most frustrating episodes , the [ORG USG  ] won points for sticking to the high road and refusing to be baited into public disputes with the [ORG GOS  ] . 
Despite our efforts to keep productive ties on track , senior [ORG GOS  ] officials continued to make unhelpful remarks throughout 2004 , particularly with respect to the [LOC U.S.  ] role in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
There was also friction regarding regional issues , such as [LOC Spain  ] 's leadership of an effort to ease [ORG EU  ] restrictive measures against [LOC Cuba  ] and [ORG Zapatero  ] 's engagement of [PER Chavez  ] in [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
Though [ORG Zapatero  ] drew massive public support for his decision to withdraw [MISC Spanish  ] troops from [LOC Iraq  ] ( and his public approval rating remains high at 63% ) , he has been criticized for subsequent missteps that have soured relations with [LOC Washington.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The turning point in [ORG Zapatero  ] 's approach to the [LOC U.S.  ] came when Ambassador [PER Argyros  ] declined to attend the October 12 national day parade , putting the public spotlight on our disappointment with the tone and direction of [MISC Spanish  ] foreign policy . 
This episode undermined [ORG GOS  ] assertions in the press that [MISC U.S.-Spanish  ] ties had not suffered as a result of [LOC Spain  ] 's withdrawal from [LOC Iraq  ] and forced the [ORG Zapatero  ] administration to acknowledge tensions in one of [LOC Spain  ] 's most important bilateral relationships . 
While polls consistently demonstrate widespread hostility among Spaniards towards [LOC U.S.  ] foreign policy , particularly in the [LOC Middle East  ] , the public still expects the [ORG GOS  ] to maintain healthy working relations with [LOC Washington  ] . 
The [MISC U.S.-Spanish  ] rift left [ORG Zapatero  ] open to withering opposition criticism that he had ruined that relationship and relegated [LOC Spain  ] to second-class status in foreign affairs. //Spain Looking to [MISC Repair Relations//  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Since November , [ORG GOS  ] officials at all levels have made clear their desire to restore strong bilateral ties , most recently when the [ORG MFA  ] 's Director General for Foreign Policy ( Under Secretary for Political Affairs equivalent ) told [ORG Charg  ] bluntly , " We want back in . 
" In responding to these overtures , we have noted that the [ORG Spanish Government  ] 's positions and public commentary since [ORG Zapatero  ] took office have generated significant skepticism within the [ORG USG  ] regarding [LOC Spain  ] 's readiness to work with us on the issues that matter most , such as in the War on Terrorism . 
We told our [ORG GOS  ] interlocutors that we were prepared to move ahead on issues of mutual importance and that unambiguous , positive actions by [LOC Spain  ] would be the best signal to the [ORG U.S. Government that Spain  ] too was ready to get past our differences. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) In the last several weeks , the [ORG GOS  ] has undertaken a series of measures that appear aimed at improving relations with the [ORG USG  ] . 
The most important of these is [LOC Spain  ] 's decision ( not yet made public ) to lead a Provincial Reconstruction Team and contribute to a forward support base in western [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( after months of prodding by [ORG USG  ] officials , including numerous [MISC Embassy  ] demarches ) . 
[LOC Spain  ] has taken other actions as well . 
The [ORG Spanish Government  ] contributed $20 million to the [LOC Iraq  ] elections ( part of its $300 million pledge made during the 2003 [LOC Iraq  ] Donors Conference ) and issued a positive public assessment of the elections themselves . 
Prior to the vote , [LOC Spain  ] had , at the [ORG USG  ] 's request , engaged [MISC Arab  ] governments to urge them to press [MISC Iraqi  ] Sunnis to participate in the elections . 
The [ORG GOS  ] also deployed King [PER Juan Carlos  ] to transmit positive messages , such as the King 's January 13 declaration at a reception for the [LOC Madrid  ] diplomatic corps that the [LOC U.S.  ] was a " fundamental point of reference for [MISC Spanish  ] foreign policy " and that the [ORG GOS  ] desired " improved bilateral ties at every level . 
" <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The [MISC Embassy  ] has welcomed these gestures , while making clear to our [ORG GOS  ] counterparts that we are still troubled by mixed signals on issues we thought had been resolved . 
For example , [ORG Zapatero  ] canceled a planned stop in [LOC Caracas  ] to meet with [PER Chavez  ] at our urging , but then dispatched Defense Minister [PER Bono  ] on a " secret " trip to [LOC Venezuela  ] to promote sales of military and civilian equipment . 
Also , on [LOC Iraq  ] , FM [PER Moratinos  ] and other government and Socialist party figures still occasionally refer to the conflict as an " illegal war " and have joined like-minded [ORG EU  ] leaders in pressing for a timetable for the [LOC U.S.  ] to withdraw troops by the end of 2005. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Some issues , notably [LOC Cuba  ] and to a lesser degree [LOC Venezuela  ] , will likely remain points of friction in the bilateral relationship . 
The driving force behind [MISC Spanish  ] overtures to [PER Castro  ] and [PER Chavez  ] is a combination of the Socialists , desire to satisfy left-wing constituents who remain attached to romantic notions of [MISC Latin American  ] revolutionary movements and a naive faith in [LOC Spain  ] 's ability to influence the two leaders in a positive direction . 
We have made clear the [ORG USG  ] 's skepticism and concern regarding the [MISC Spanish  ] approach and believe we may succeed in limiting [ORG GOS  ] interaction with [LOC Caracas  ] to commercial rather than political collaboration . 
There is less cause for optimism on [LOC Cuba  ] , where [ORG Zapatero  ] 's team appears intent on reviving " constructive engagement " at almost any cost. //Defining [ORG USG  ] Objectives in [LOC Spain//  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Despite our turbulent relations with [ORG Zapatero  ] , we have continued to engage the [ORG GOS  ] constructively at the working level on the issues that matter most to us , with positive results . 
Most importantly , the [ORG Zapatero Government  ] has not placed restrictions on [LOC U.S.  ] forces access to [ORG Rota Naval Air Station  ] and [LOC Moron Air Base  ] , and has continued to issue blanket overflight clearances for [LOC U.S.  ] forces transiting [MISC Spanish  ] airspace , including to support operations in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Military to military relations are strong in other respects and the uniformed services are among our strongest proponents in the current government . 
They are still smarting from their sudden and ignominious withdrawal from [LOC Iraq  ] and have been forward leaning in recommending deployments to [LOC Afghanistan  ] as a means of demonstrating their reliability as an ally and their commitment to the War on Terror . 
We want to strengthen this important bilateral relationship , for example by fixing a date for High-Level Bilateral Defense Committee talks in [LOC Washington.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The [ORG USG  ] also has a strong interest in deepening its counter-terrorism cooperation with the [ORG GOS  ] , particularly given the large and dangerous presence in the country of extremist organizations affiliated with al-Qaeda . 
In the wake of the March 11 train bombings , the [ORG GOS  ] has clamped down on such organizations , leading to 117 arrests of suspected [MISC Islamic  ] terrorists in 2004 . 
However , judicial and investigative gaps in the [MISC Spanish  ] system and the burgeoning population of [MISC North African  ] immigrants will make [LOC Spain  ] an active front in the War on Terror for years to come. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Judicial and law-enforcement counter-terrorism cooperation with [LOC Spain  ] is good and Attorney General [PER Ashcroft  ] visited in December to improve it further by signing the bilateral protocol to the [ORG U.S.-EU Mutual Legal Assistance  ] and [ORG Extradition Treaties  ] . 
Also in 2004 , the [ORG GOS  ] requested talks with the [ORG USG  ] on forming a joint counter-terrorism investigative unit . 
This would be difficult for the [ORG USG  ] to implement for technical reasons , but a DOJ team met with [MISC Spanish  ] counterparts in December to identify mechanisms for improving information sharing and judicial cooperation . 
We can solidify our counter-terrorism relations by inviting Minister of the Interior [PER Jose Antonio Alonso  ] - a close friend of President [PER Zapatero  ] - to [LOC Washington  ] at the earliest possible date . 
[PER Alonso  ] 's staff has made clear [PER Alonso  ] desires such an invitation . 
Minister of Justice [PER Juan Fernando Lopez Aguilar  ] has also expressed interest in visiting [LOC Washington  ] to discuss improved counter-terrorism cooperation. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) We have strong commercial interests in [LOC Spain  ] as well , with a business community that is staunchly supportive of [LOC U.S.  ] investment and concerned that [ORG Zapatero  ] 's policies will lead to a decrease in [LOC U.S.  ] business involvement . 
At every opportunity , we work to cultivate relations with [ORG GOS  ] trade officials and encourage them to maintain a business-friendly environment in [LOC Spain.  ] //What Does [LOC Spain  ] Want ? // <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOS  ] has gotten the message that a conflictive relationship with the [ORG USG  ] is not in its best interest domestically or internationally . 
In the short term , they want a signal from us acknowledging their recent positive steps . 
In the [ORG GOS  ] view , this could take the form of meetings in [LOC Washington  ] in the next few months for Defense Minister [PER Bono  ] , Foreign Minister [PER Moratinos  ] , and later in the year , President [ORG Zapatero  ] . 
[LOC Spain  ] would also seek public statements recognizing its contributions in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] reconstruction , and inclusion in [LOC U.S.  ] councils with allies on issues such as the [LOC Middle East  ] conflict , the [LOC Darfur  ] crisis , matters related to the [LOC Greater Middle East  ] , and other issues of mutual interest. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) As an alternative to such high-level engagement , we could instead make a concerted effort at a lower level to acknowledge each [MISC Spanish  ] gesture as a step in the right direction . 
This could take the form of a letter or a phone call from a [ORG USG  ] official to thank the [ORG GOS  ] for a specific action , such as its participation in the [LOC PRT  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and its donation of funds to the [LOC Iraq  ] elections . 
At a minimum , we strongly recommend agreeing to requests for meetings in [LOC Washington  ] by Minister of the Interior [PER Jose Antonio Alonso  ] and Minister of Justice [PER Juan Fernando Lopez Aguilar  ] to discuss counter-terrorism cooperation . 
The objective of this calibrated approach would be to note progress on issues of interest to the [ORG USG  ] and create momentum for higher level meetings while not giving the [ORG GOS  ] the impression that we will overlook remaining points of conflict , such as President [ORG Zapatero  ] 's possible visit to [LOC Venezuela  ] in [LOC March.  ] //Steering Relations Toward a Productive [MISC Course//  ] <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) The [ORG USG  ] will not re-establish with the [ORG Zapatero Government  ] the deep and close relationship we had with the [MISC Aznar  ] administration . 
However , we are currently in a strong position to influence [ORG Zapatero  ] towards a more productive course that achieves [LOC U.S.  ] interests in [LOC Spain  ] and other parts of the world . 
We have insisted with our [ORG GOS  ] contacts that improved relations mean more than photo opportunities and expressions of goodwill ; a real partnership implies positive actions . 
Those within the [ORG GOS  ] who accepted this message counseled [ORG Zapatero  ] to undertake the series of positive gestures described above . 
We believe we should now lock in these advances and respond favorably to these gestures in order to steer [ORG Zapatero  ] towards supporting other [ORG USG  ] objectives. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) This may be a gradual and sometimes frustrating effort , since [ORG Zapatero  ] 's political instincts and those of other Socialist leaders , combined with their lingering insecurity over the nature of their electoral victory , will at times tempt them to emphasize their differences with [ORG USG  ] policies . 
For the moment , the [ORG USG  ] 's balanced use of carrots and sticks with the [ORG GOS  ] has gotten [LOC Spain  ] pointed in the right direction . 
It is our sense that this opening will not last much longer and that eventually national pride and humiliation over [ORG USG  ] snubs will lead [PER Zapatero  ] to suspend [MISC Spanish  ] overtures and turn a deaf ear to [ORG USG  ] requests for cooperation .
