End Summary . 
2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Local state-run media outlets , including " [LOC Libya  ] [PER Al Youm  ] " and " [LOC Libya  ] Watanona " are reporting on the impending release of [PER Megrahi  ] in a factual manner , without commentary or specification of the [LOC U.S.  ] response to the [MISC Scottish  ] decision . 
Print outlet " [MISC Oya  ] " featured an article that quotes a cancer specialist as calling for [PER Megrahi  ] 's release on medical grounds after having examining him . 
3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [LOC Libya  ] 's weekly-printed [MISC English  ] language newspaper , " The [ORG Tripoli Post  ] , " features a front-page article profiling [PER Megrahi  ] 's 95 year-old mother , entitled " [PER Al  ] [ORG Megrahi Calls Mother Who Says She Keeps Door Open  ] , Expecting Him to Enter at [MISC Any Time  ] . 
" The article describes his mother , [PER Hajja Fatma  ] , as " frail but upbeat , " and explains that her family thinks it best for her health not to tell her that [PER Megrahi  ] 's condition is terminal . 
In the article she explains that she never locks her door in hopes that her son will return home after his ten year absence . 
4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Internet commentary from [MISC Libyan  ] citizens in response to a [LOC UK  ] press article on [PER Megrahi  ] 's release primarily reflects support for the decision , although one reader called on [LOC Libya  ] to take action to release prisoners of conscience . 
Several readers expressed religious praise for [PER Megrahi  ] 's release , while others called the conviction of [PER Megrahi  ] " political " and a " conspiracy . 
" One reader described his release as confirmation of his innocence . 
5 . 
( C ) [MISC Comment: While  ] " The [ORG Tripoli Post  ] " article created a human interest story out of the experience of [PER Megrahi  ] 's mother , other local media outlets continue to report factually on the matter and have neither reprinted nor commented on any international opinions about [PER Megrahi  ] 's release . 
" The [ORG Tripoli Post  ] " article will likely engender sympathy among readers for [PER Megrahi  ] 's ill condition and that of his mother , although the [MISC Libyan  ] web responses show that sympathy for [PER Megrahi  ] already exists among the local population . 
The characterization of [PER Megrahi  ] 's conviction as " political " or conspiratorial corresponds to the dominant opinion on the [MISC Libyan  ] street , as well as to the statements [PER Qadhafi  ] made to [PER CODEL McCain  ] on the issue ( ref A ) . 
We have not seen any indications that the public response to [PER Megrahi  ] 's return will be anti-American or anti-Western . 
We continue to monitor the situation .
