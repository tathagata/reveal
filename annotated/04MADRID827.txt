( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG ETA  ] terrorists struck March 11 in the center of [LOC Madrid  ] , placing bombs on four commuter trains . 
There were a total of 13 explosions ( including three police-controlled explosions to disactivate bombs . 
) The bombs exploded in the middle of rush hour , from 0835 to 0855 local . 
Interior Minister [PER Acebes  ] confirmed that the [ORG GOS  ] had " no doubt " that [ORG ETA  ] was responsible . 
He also confirmed that there were no advisory calls before the bombs went off . 
The death toll continues to mount . 
According to [PER Acebes  ] and other official sources , the death toll was 173 , with more than 600 wounded . 
FM [PER Ana Palacio  ] also commented to the press that [ORG ETA  ] was responsible , as did [ORG Popular Party  ] candidate for President of the Government , [PER Mariano Rajoy.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) As noted in reftels , [ORG ETA  ] experts in the [MISC Spanish  ] police , as well as other [MISC Spanish  ] officials , had expressed concern to us that [ORG ETA  ] would seek to strike before the March 14 general elections . 
Our contacts said [ORG ETA  ] would seek to strike during the high profile election campaign to demonstrate that , despite suffering unprecedented arrests and disruption , it had not given up . 
In the past two months , police have had success in disrupting two major [ORG ETA  ] attempted attacks . 
On February 29 , two [ORG ETA  ] operatives were arrested about 100 miles east of [LOC Madrid  ] . 
One was driving a truck laden with 536 kg of explosives , destined for detonation in [LOC Madrid  ] . 
On December 24 police stopped an attempt by two [ORG ETA  ] operatives to place backpacks laden with explosives on a train going from [MISC Irun  ] ( [MISC Basque  ] region ) to a [LOC Madrid  ] train station . 
[PER Acebes  ] said that this demonstrated [ORG ETA  ] had been looking for a spectacular attack , with major civilian casualties . 
He added: " I will not accept the intolerable assertion by those who try to divert the culpability to other groups . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As a result of these and other police operations , and the arrest of 126 [ORG ETA  ] operatives and accomplices in [LOC Spain  ] in 2003 , [ORG ETA  ] had not killed anyone in a terrorist attack since May 2003 . 
The total of three [ORG ETA  ] killings for 2003 was the lowest figure in [ORG ETA  ] 's history ( apart from brief periods of unilateral " cease-fire " ) . 
Prior to this attack , [ORG ETA  ] 's highest number of victims in a single attack was in [LOC Barcelona  ] in 1987 when [ORG ETA  ] exploded a bomb in a [ORG Hipercor  ] shopping center , killing 21 . 
( [ORG ETA  ] claimed that it did not intend to kill so many civilians at [ORG Hipercor  ] but that there had been a problem with the warning call . 
) Apart from this , several [ORG ETA  ] attacks caused 10 or 12 fatalities , often against police targets . 
But [ORG ETA  ] had more typically targeted its victims more discriminately , generally killing one or two at a time . 
The total number persons [ORG ETA  ] had killed , before the March 11 Madrid attack , was about 850. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) This attack comes only three days before March 14 general elections . 
Both major political parties have canceled campaign events , including major end of campaign rallies scheduled for March 12 . 
A spokesman for [ORG ETA  ] 's political arm , the de-legalized party [ORG Batasuna  ] , [PER Arnaldo Otegi  ] , claims that the attack could not have been by [ORG ETA  ] since , he claimed , [ORG ETA  ] phones in ahead of time . 
[PER Otegi  ] attributed the attack to [MISC Islamic  ] extremists . 
President 's Office contacts have called us to stress that the [ORG GOS  ] is sure that the perpetrator is [ORG ETA  ] , as [PER Acebes  ] has stated emphatically . 
They request that the USG support this in its declarations and not express any doubt in public comments about the party responsible. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ambassador has called King [PER Juan Carlos  ] , FM [PER Palacio  ] , [LOC Madrid Region  ] President [PER Aguirre  ] and President [PER Aznar  ] 's Office to express our solidarity with [LOC Spain  ] . 
FM [PER Palacio  ] made a point in her conversation with the Ambassador in objecting to media use of the term " [MISC Basque  ] Separatists " to describe [ORG ETA  ] . 
Now more than ever , she stressed , [ORG ETA  ] must be called only by the name of " [ORG ETA  ] Terrorists . 
" The Ambassador will also write letters to Interior Minister [PER Acebes  ] , the Mayor of [LOC Madrid  ] , and other senior officials. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Comment: The magnitude of death and injuries caused by the attack is unprecedented in [ORG ETA  ] 's history and is , by far , the worst terrorist attack [LOC Spain  ] has suffered . 
The fact that there was no warning call combined with massive civilian casualties represents a major departure in [ORG ETA  ] 's modus operandi . 
The two foiled attacks mentioned ( para 2 ) above indicate that [ORG ETA  ] was already changing its tactics in favor of indiscriminate attacks . 
As per reftels , an [ORG ETA  ] under intense police and judicial pressure and lacking in technical skill for pinpointed attacks appears to have decided to lash out , not unlike a wounded animal , to cause maximum civilian harm . 
As far as the political campaign is concerned , [PER Mariano Rajoy  ] and the [ORG Popular Party  ] , have made waging the war against [ORG ETA  ] , without compromise or dialogue , central to their campaign . 
An [ORG ETA  ] attack , even this enormous one , should thus not work against the governing party . 
However , if [ORG ETA  ] 's political wing ( the de-legalized [ORG Batausna  ] ) is able to seed doubt about the perpetrator , some might blame the [ORG PP  ] government for exposing [LOC Spain  ] to [MISC Islamic  ] extremist terrorism because of its [LOC Iraq  ] policy . 
Hence the call to us from [LOC Moncloa  ] for the USG to be clear in public comments that the perpetrator of this tragedy is [ORG ETA  ] .
