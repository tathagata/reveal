Patterson  ] , for reasons 1.4 ( b ) ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary . 
As Foreign Minister [PER Qureshi  ] and his team arrive in [LOC Washington  ] for coordination on the [LOC Holbrooke/Riedel  ] strategic review , Post offers the following thoughts on issues for strategic engagement . 
In the coming weeks , Post will detail our suggestions on how to expand political , economic , security , and intelligence engagement with [LOC Pakistan  ] from the current $2 billion annually to $4 billion beginning in FY2011 . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) As we work to prevent [MISC Pakistan-based  ] attacks on the [LOC U.S.  ] and its forces , we should be clear that al-Qaida ( [ORG AQ  ] ) now wants more than just a safe-haven in [LOC Pakistan  ] , and defeating a growing witches’ brew of [ORG AQ  ] , [ORG Taliban  ] , local extremists and criminals will be a long 10-15 year fight . 
President [PER Zardari  ] has summed it up by saying , “the militants now are after me and my job.” The militant takeover of [LOC Swat  ] in the [ORG Northwest Frontier Province  ] ( [ORG NWFP  ] ) is the most striking example of how far and how fast the government is losing control over its territory . 
As the fight continues , we expect [ORG AQ  ] to increase both its offensive and defensive operations to protect its equities . 
It simply has nowhere else to go . 
Understanding [LOC Swat  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Talks continue between [PER Tehrik Nizam Shariat Mohammed  ] ( [ORG Movement for Shari’a  ] or [ORG TNSM  ] ) leader [PER Sufi Mohammad  ] and his son-in-law [PER Maulana Fazlullah  ] , who works with the [MISC Tehrik-e-Taliban  ] movement headed by [PER Baitullah Mehsud  ] . 
The [ORG Army  ] appears unwilling or unable to control the area , and the population is fed up with both indiscriminate [ORG Army  ] shelling and taliban-imposed terror . 
So , the [ORG Awami National Party  ] ( [ORG ANP  ] ) and the [ORG Army  ] are trying a new version of a failed strategy . 
Through [PER Sufi Mohammad  ] , the [ORG NWFP  ] provincial government is trying to split the population from [MISC Fazlullah’s  ] taliban by offering adherence to a form of [ORG Shari’a  ] law , interpreted locally as swift justice . 
The [ORG NWFP  ] offer on [ORG Shari’a  ] has not been signed by President [PER Zardari  ] and is conditioned on establishment of peace in [LOC Swat  ] . 
The [ORG Army  ] has not withdrawn from its positions , and it insists it will not withdraw until peace is established. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Few [MISC Pakistanis  ] believe the deal will hold for more than two-three weeks . 
A similar deal failed in 2008 ; Post does not believe that [PER Sufi  ] has the clout to deliver . 
[MISC Fazlullah’s  ] taliban are not going to lay down their arms--they have already violated their alleged cease-fire . 
ANP’s weak argument is that even a failed deal will expose [MISC Fazlullah’s  ] real intentions ; the Army’s view is that the deal at least buys them some time to regroup forces . 
Post’s concern is that by signaling its willingness to surrender , the deal has made it even harder for the inevitable [ORG Army  ] re-engagement in [LOC Swat  ] . 
While talks continue , however , we are working through State/USAID/DOD with [ORG UN  ] agencies and [ORG ICRC  ] to get relief supplies to the beleaguered [MISC Swati  ] population . 
We also are working with the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] to provide the [ORG NWFP  ] police with short-term support ( salary supplements/death benefits , hardening police stations ) while we implement a longer-term plan to deliver additional equipment and training needed to back up [ORG Army  ] action . 
Establishing Trust <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [MISC Pakistani  ] team will come hoping , once again , to forge long-lasting ties with the [LOC U.S.  ] As Vice President [PER Biden  ] has noted , however , the relationship for too long has been transactional in nature . 
It also has been based on mutual mistrust . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] hedges its bets on cooperation because it fears the [LOC U.S.  ] will again desert [LOC Islamabad  ] after we get [PER Osama Bin Laden  ] ; [LOC Washington  ] sees this hesitancy as duplicity that requires we take unilateral action to protect [LOC U.S.  ] interests . 
After 9/11 , then President [PER Musharraf  ] made a strategic shift to abandon the [ORG Taliban  ] and support the [LOC U.S.  ] in the war on terror , but neither side believes the other has lived up to expectations flowing from that decision . 
The relationship is one of co-dependency we grudgingly admit--Pakistan knows the [LOC U.S.  ] cannot afford to walk away ; the [LOC U.S.  ] knows [LOC Pakistan  ] cannot survive without our support . 
Supporting Democracy/Defeating Extremism ISLAMABAD 00000385 002.3 OF 003 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Militants will exploit either weak civilian government or a return to military rule that lacks popular legitimacy , so we should help the [ORG Zardari/Gilani  ] government complete its full five-year term in office . 
We can work with [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] if he wins the next election , but [PER Zardari  ] is our best ally in [LOC Pakistan  ] right now , and [LOC U.S.  ] interests are best served by preventing another cycle of military rule . 
[PER Qureshi  ] will remind us that the [MISC GOP  ] needs an international democracy dividend in the form of economic aid , improved governance , and effective law enforcement. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) We can respond first by offering robust [LOC U.S.  ] support at the [ORG IMF/World Bank Donors’ Conference  ] in April . 
We now are providing approximately $2 billion annually to [LOC Pakistan  ] , including: $1.2 billion in [ORG Coalition Support Fund  ] reimbursements ; $150 million to improve socio-economic conditions in [LOC FATA  ] ; $300 million in ESF aid for the rest of [LOC Pakistan  ] ; over $10 million for internally displaced persons fleeing combat in [LOC Bajaur  ] , [LOC Mohmand  ] and [LOC Swat  ] ; $300 million ( not yet received ) ; and an imminent $15 million in aid to the [ORG NWFP  ] police. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) If approved and financed , the [MISC Kerry-Lugar  ] legislation will enable us to triple non-military aid to $1.5 billion per year . 
We will plan in FY 2010 to spend over $100 million to augment civilian police and $873 million to build counter-insurgency capability . 
This means giving police protective vests and rapid reaction capability , teaching the military how to coordinate ground and air operations and helping the [ORG Army  ] keep more than two attack helicopters in the air at one time . 
We can build trust , address the issue of alleged [LOC U.S.  ] strikes , and help [MISC Pakistanis  ] target militants through enhanced [MISC DOD-based  ] intelligence cooperation at the [ORG Torkham Joint Coordination Center  ] . 
We need to help the [MISC GOP  ] implement an effective strategic communications plan . 
Changing Mindsets <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) President [PER Zardari  ] and PM [PER Gilani  ] recognize Pakistan’s greatest threat has shifted from [LOC India  ] to militancy concentrated on the [MISC Pak-Afghan  ] border but is spreading to [ORG NWFP  ] and beyond . 
The [ORG Army  ] and [ORG ISI  ] , however , have not turned that corner . 
We should press the [MISC GOP  ] on the need to stop using militant/tribal proxies as foreign policy tools . 
It is now counterproductive to Pakistan’s own interests and directly conflicts with [ORG USG  ] objectives in [LOC Afghanistan--where Haqqani’s  ] network is killing [MISC American  ] soldiers and [MISC Afghan  ] civilians--and the region--where [LOC Mumbai  ] exposed the fruits of previous [ORG ISI  ] policy to create [LOC Lashkar-e-Taiba  ] and still threatens potential conflict between nuclear powers . 
However , we should preface this conversation with a pledge to open a new page in relations . 
Chief of [ORG Army Staff General Kayani  ] , who headed [ORG ISI  ] from 2004-2007 , in particular wants to avoid a reckoning with the past , and we will not shift [MISC Pakistani  ] military/ISI policy without his support. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Given recent events in [LOC Swat  ] , the [ORG Army  ] needs to decide if it is truly prepared to commit the troops and suffer the casualties required to win and accept the training needed to shift from a conventional war with [LOC India  ] to a [MISC COIN-based  ] strategy along the [MISC Pak-Afghan  ] border . 
We should probe the team for what [LOC Pakistan  ] needs from [LOC India  ] to enable it to redeploy badly-needed [MISC Pakistani  ] forces from its eastern to its western border . 
Making [LOC Afghanistan  ] a Success <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) We should ask what kind of government [LOC Islamabad  ] can accept in [LOC Kabul  ] and how [LOC Pakistan  ] plans to help the [ORG U.S./NATO  ] succeed in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The team will be concerned about the effect of a troop build-up in southern [LOC Afghanistan  ] across from [LOC Balochistan  ] , where [LOC Pakistan  ] has meager forces to defend a long and unpopulated border . 
We should discuss the reality that the [LOC U.S.  ] will be doubling cargo shipments through [LOC Pakistan  ] ( both the [ORG Torkham  ] and [LOC Chaman  ] crossings ) in support of our troop build-up in [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) As [ORG ISI General Director  ] [PER Pasha  ] has said , “we can’t kill all the militants.” [PER Qureshi  ] , noting recent comments by [ORG Defense Secretary Gates  ] , will suggest it is time to review efforts to reach out to [ORG Taliban  ] “reconcilables” on both sides ISLAMABAD 00000385 003.2 OF 003 of the border . 
If this initiative progresses , we should consider establishing a Disarmament , Demobilization and Reintegration ( DDR ) process in both [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] for [ORG Taliban  ] , [LOC Lashkar-e-Taiba  ] and other militant fighters . 
Thinking Regionally <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Pakistan’s principal strategic focus remains fixated on [LOC India  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] as strategic depth in the fight against [LOC India  ] , and the core [LOC Kashmir  ] issue . 
However , the current civilian and military leadership is the most pro-Indian that [LOC New Delhi  ] is likely to see , and we should not allow [LOC Mumbai  ] to derail rapprochement . 
Both sides should resume [ORG Composite Dialogue  ] negotiations , re-establish back-channel negotiations , and increase trade across both the [MISC Wagah  ] border and the [ORG Kashmir Line of Control.  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) This presumes that [LOC Pakistan  ] , with continued [ORG USG  ] pressure , proceeds with prosecution of the [LOC Mumbai  ] suspects . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] also needs more clearly to shut down its support for [LOC Lashkar-e-Taiba  ] militancy in [LOC Kashmir  ] . 
[PER Qureshi  ] will want to hear a [ORG USG  ] commitment to press the [MISC Indians  ] to respond to the [MISC GOP’s  ] list of follow-up questions on the investigation . 
We should encourage [LOC Islamabad  ] to send , and [LOC New Delhi  ] to receive , a [MISC Pakistani  ] police investigatory team to collect evidence in support of successful [LOC Mumbai  ] prosecutions. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER Qureshi  ] likely will repeat Zardari’s pleas for [ORG USG  ] intervention with [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , UAE and other Gulf states to deliver oil at concessional prices ; to date , our efforts have been rebuffed but the upcoming [ORG Donors’ Conference  ] would provide another avenue to press for assistance. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) We should leverage [MISC China’s  ] interest in a stable [LOC Pakistan  ] by urging its continued support at the [ORG Donors’ Conference  ] but reminding [LOC Beijing  ] that efforts to block 1267 designations and give [LOC Pakistan  ] two unsanctioned civilian nuclear reactors are not helpful . 
[PER Zardari  ] would like to accept Iran’s offer of financial assistance but we doubt he will proceed without [LOC U.S.  ] blessing .
