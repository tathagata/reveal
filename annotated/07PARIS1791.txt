President [PER Bush  ] called president-elect [PER Sarkozy  ] at 8:05 P.M. [LOC Paris  ] time to congratulate him . 
A record turn-out of 85 percent of registered voters confirms the intense interest this election has generated among the [MISC French  ] , just as [PER Sarkozy  ] 's convincing victory confirms their collective decision to endorse the market-oriented reform platform that he ran on . 
END SUMMARY A CLEAR-CUT , CONVINCING VICTORY ------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
Former Interior Minister [PER Nicolas Sarkozy  ] 's second-round win over Socialist Party candidate [PER Segolene Royal  ] in [LOC France  ] 's 2007 presidential election is , by any measure , a clear-cut , convincing victory . 
Official , if preliminary , results announced by [LOC France  ] 's [ORG Interior Ministry  ] at 8 P.M. [LOC Paris  ] time on Sunday May 6 show that [PER Sarkozy  ] got 53 percent of the 38 million votes cast and [PER Royal  ] got 47 percent . 
Final , official vote tallies will be posted as they come in on the [MISC French  ] [ORG Interior Ministry  ] 's website at http://www.interieur.gouv.fr .

Of [LOC France  ] 's 44.5 million registered voters , 85.5 percent cast ballots on May 6 for either [PER Sarkozy  ] or [PER Royal  ] , or cast null ballots . 
THAT GIVES [PER SARKOZY  ] A MANDATE ---------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) In electing -- by a clear-cut majority -- the activist , mold-breaking [PER Sarkozy  ] the [MISC French  ] have clearly endorsed the largely market-oriented reform agenda that [PER Sarkozy  ] ran on . 
They have also given him a vote of confidence , betting that he will grow in office -- and that his unsettling , often divisive , personality traits that put off so many will be attenuated by the responsibilities of office . 
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT ----------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) [PER Sarkozy  ] has said that he expects to be inaugurated shortly before the end of President [PER Chirac  ] 's term , probably on Wednesday May 16 ( [PER Chirac  ] 's five-year term ends at midnight on the 16 ) . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] and [PER Chirac  ] might agree to transfer power earlier , possibly as early as May 14 . 
In the interim , between his election and inauguration , [PER Sarkozy  ] has promised that , accompanied by a small group of advisors , he will take some days off to " reflect on the heavy responsibilities ahead . 
" Something more than speculation about who will head the [PER Sarkozy  ] administration 's first government should emerge from this " retreat " led by the president-elect . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] has promised that he will try to achieve gender parity in his administration 's first cabinet . 
Former Education Minister [PER Francois Fillon  ] and current Minister of Social Solidarity [PER Jean-Louis Borloo  ] are generally viewed as the two leading candidates for the prime minister 's slot . 
In coming days president-elect [PER Sarkozy  ] 's statements should confirm how , and how quickly , he plans to proceed with his reform agenda , and we will report accordingly .
