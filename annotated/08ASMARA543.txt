( [LOC S/NF  ] ) An Alleged [MISC Ethiopian Assassination  ] Attempt: [PER Isaias  ] and [PER Meles  ] , brothers in arms during the 1980s , are now blood enemies . 
Why ? 
In 1996 , while returning from a vacation in [LOC Kenya  ] , [PER Isaias  ] , his family , and his inner entourage stopped in [LOC Addis  ] , where [PER Meles  ] offered to fly them back to [LOC Asmara  ] in one of his aircraft . 
[PER Isaias  ] accepted the offer ; en route the aircraft caught fire , but managed to turn back and land safely in [LOC Addis  ] . 
According to someone who was on the aircraft , an infuriatd [PER Isaias  ] accuse [PER Meles  ] to his face of trying to kill him and his family . 
[PER Isaias  ] has not trusted [PER Meles  ] since , according to this source. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) Fears of an [MISC American  ] Assassination Attempt: [PER Isaias  ] thinks the [LOC United States  ] will attempt to kill him by missile strike on his residence in the city of [LOC Massawa  ] , according to late 2007 information from the Force Commander of [LOC UNMEE.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Holier Than Thou: [PER Isaias  ] has berated the [MISC Chinese  ] ambassador in [LOC Asmara  ] for [LOC China  ] 's embrace of market capitalism . 
[PER Isaias  ] was sent to [LOC China  ] by the [ORG Eritrean Liberation Front  ] for political commissar training in the 1960s , where , according to the [MISC Chinese  ] ambassador , " he learned all the wrong things . 
" [PER Isaias  ] was turned off by the cult of personality surrounding [PER Mao  ] , but apparently internalized [MISC Maoist  ] ideology. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Fluent in [MISC Arabic: Asmara-based  ] Arab ambassadors are impressed by [MISC Isaias'  ] fluency in [MISC Arabic  ] . 
There is some debate about where he learned it , but all agree he is a comfortable and capable [MISC Arabic  ] speaker. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Talented Speechwriter: In mid-2008 , after [PER Isaias  ] delivered an impressive address in [MISC English  ] to a gathering of ministerial-level representatives on the subject of [LOC Darfur  ] , [PER Yemane Ghebremeskel  ] , the director of the office of the president , said [PER Isaias  ] had written the speech himself. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Hot Temper: At a January 2008 dinner he hosted for a codel and embassy officials , [PER Isaias  ] became involved in a heated discussion with his Amcit legal advisor about some tomato seedlings the legal advisor provided to [MISC Isaias'  ] wife . 
[PER Isaias  ] complained that despite tender care by his wife , the plants produced only tiny tomatoes . 
When the legal advisor explained that they were cherry tomatoes and were supposed to be small , [PER Isaias  ] lost his temper and stormed out of the venue , much to the surprise of everyone , including his security detail. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Holds a Grudge: A senior party official said [PER Isaias  ] and [LOC Djibouti  ] President [PER Guelleh  ] had ( g ( eed during a 'u'e 2008 telephone conversation to try to resolve at the presidential level issues related to the June border clash . 
According this senior [MISC Eritrean  ] official , [PER Isaias  ] was livid when [PER Guelleh  ] supposedly shortly thereafter lambasted [MISC Eritrean  ] aggression in a media interview . 
[PER Isaias  ] reportedly felt personally betrayed by President [PER Guelleh  ] , and has been obstinate about resolving the [MISC Djibouti-Eritrea  ] border dispute ever since. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Thin [PER Skinned:  ] [PER Isaias  ] asked to be named the patron of the [MISC World Bank-funded Cultural Assets Rehabilitation Project  ] ( [ORG CARP  ] ) . 
When individuals involved with [ORG CARP  ] published the book " [LOC Asmara: Africa  ] 's Secret Modernist City , " it failed to include a note of thanks to [ORG CARP  ] 's patron . 
[PER Isaias  ] was miffed and shut down [PER CARP.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Good Op-Sec: [PER Isaias  ] has an aversion to talking on the telephone and frequently sleeps in different locations to foil a coup or assassination attempt . 
During the winter months he spends most of his time in [LOC Massawa  ] rather than in [LOC Asmara  ] . 
When dining in restaurants , [PER Isaias  ] will often switch plates with a subordinate , apparently to avoid being poisoned , according to the [MISC Qatari  ] ambassador. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The Early Years of [ORG Little Beer Pot: Isaias'  ] father , [PER Afwerki  ] , comes from the village of [LOC Tselot  ] , which is perched on the lip of a 7,000' escarpment four miles southeast of [LOC Asmara  ] . 
When [PER Isaias  ] was a boy [PER Afwerki  ] reportedly spent much of his time in [LOC Tigray  ] , where he owned a coffee farm that was later nationalized by the [LOC Derg  ] . 
With [PER Afwerki  ] largely absent , [PER Isaias  ] lived with his mother ( rumored to have family roots in [LOC Tigray  ] ) in a working class neighborhood in eastern [LOC Asmara  ] near the train depot and the [MISC Lutheran  ] church . 
[MISC Isaias'  ] mother made and sold a traditional beer called sewa . 
By some accounts , [PER Isaias  ] was nicknamed the [LOC Tigrinya  ] equivalent of " [MISC Beer Pot  ] , " after the ceramic jug from which sewa is dispensed.Q Qoday he is a [MISC QeQvy  ] whisky drinker , but perhaps as a youth his nickname referred as much to his habits as to his mother 's business. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) No Pork for His Ancestral Village: In November 2008 emboffs visited [LOC Tselot  ] and saw no indication that the village has received any special favor from [PER Isaias  ] . 
Like most [MISC Eritrean  ] villages , it has electricity but no running water or sewer system . 
Gaunt cattle and untended donkeys roam the village . 
Their droppings are quickly gathered and formed into oval patties , which are then stuck on rock walls , dried , and used as fuel for cooking . 
[PER Afwerki  ] is said to be buried in the village cemetery , but emboffs could not locate his grave . 
[MISC Isaias'  ] immediate family is rarely featured in the state-run media and keeps a low profile . 
Although his portrait adorns many shops in [LOC Asmara  ] , there is no cult of personality in [LOC Eritrea  ] . 
[PER Isaias  ] often appears in the media clad casually in slacks , jacket , open-necked shirt , and sandals or loafers . 
He rarely travels in a motorcade. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Hard-hearted: When a visiting [LOC U.S.  ] movie star in early 2008 raised the plight of two [ORG Embassy Asmara  ] FSNs who have been imprisoned without charge since 2001 , [PER Isaias  ] glared stonily at her and replied , " Would you like me to hold a trial and then hang them ?
