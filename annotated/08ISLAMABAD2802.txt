Patterson  ] , for reasons 1.4 ( b ) ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary . 
In separate meetings with [PER Asif Zardari  ] , PM [PER Gilani  ] and Chief of Army Staff [PER Kayani  ] , Ambassador pressed for quick action on immunity for former President [PER Musharraf  ] . 
[PER Zardari  ] and [PER Gilani  ] said flatly that they were committed to providing immunity , but not until after the presidential election ( now scheduled for September 6 ) . 
Pushing immunity now , they believed , could jeopardize [MISC Zardari’s  ] candidacy . 
[PER Kayani  ] expressed concern that if immunity becomes tied up with the ongoing debate over the judges’ future , it may never happen . 
[PER Zardari  ] plans to continue to slow roll action on the judges’ restoration but remains confident that [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] will not walk out of the coalition . 
Nawaz’s deadlines for action on the judges continue to pass unfulfilled ; the next one is scheduled for August 27 . 
The decision by the [ORG Muttahida Quami Movement  ] ( [ORG MQM  ] ) August 20 to back [PER Zardari  ] for President has strengthened [MISC Zardari’s  ] hand against [PER Nawaz  ] . 
[PER Nawaz  ] is left with the option of walking out of the coalition but having little prospect of forcing a new general election in the short term . 
[PER Zardari  ] is walking tall these days , hopefully not too tall to forget his promise to [PER Kayani  ] and to us on an immunity deal . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Ambassador met with [ORG Pakistan People’s Party  ] ( [ORG PPP  ] ) leader [PER Asif Zardari  ] on August 23 , with PM [PER Gilani  ] on August 21 , and with [ORG COAS  ] [PER Kayani  ] on August 20. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Zardari  ] told Ambassador August 23 that he was committed to indemnity for [PER Musharraf  ] . 
Ambassador stressed that only the promise of indemnity had persuaded [PER Musharraf  ] to step down as President . 
We believed , as we had often said , that [PER Musharraf  ] should have a dignified retirement and not be hounded out of the country . 
[PER Zardari  ] cited a [MISC British  ] anecdote about the [MISC Spanish  ] empire and said “tell the most powerful man in the world that there is no way that I would go back on what I have said.” [PER Zardari  ] noted that he already had firmly committed to the [LOC U.S.  ] , the [LOC UK  ] , and Chief of Army Staff ( [ORG COAS  ] ) [PER Kayani  ] that indemnity for [PER Musharraf  ] would be forthcoming . 
Ambassador urged him to do it quickly . 
[PER Zardari  ] said flatly that to do it before he was elected President would lose him votes , but he would do both the legislation and a presidential pardon as soon as he was elected . 
[PER Zardari  ] revealed that former President [PER Musharraf  ] had approached Chief [PER Justice Dogar  ] about issuing a restraining order against the impeachment motion , but [PER Dogar  ] had refused . 
[PER Zardari  ] also alleged that [PER Musharraf  ] had planned to replace [ORG COAS  ] [PER Kayani  ] if [PER Dogar  ] had blocked the impeachment . 
4 . 
( C ) [PER Zardari  ] said he was trying to keep [PER Nawaz  ] in the coalition and was candid that he planned to tie up the judges issue for a long time . 
He said the parliament would debate the restoration of the judges ; Chief [PER Justice Dogar  ] would then submit some rulings on the restoration of the judges ; all this could take months . 
In the meantime , he was trying to persuade former Chief [PER Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry  ] to become Governor of [LOC Balochistan  ] . 
( Note: In a move clearly orchestrated by [PER Zardari  ] , the Governor [LOC Magsi  ] of [LOC Balochistan  ] resigned on August 20 , making it possible to offer the position to [PER Chaudhry  ] . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Zardari  ] said he did not think [PER Nawaz  ] would leave the coalition , but he admitted the [LOC Pakistan  ] [MISC Muslim League-Nawaz  ] had become increasingly testy . 
He said that he had already agreed with [PER Nawaz  ] to curtail the powers of the President and then allow [PER Nawaz  ] to be eligible for a third term as Prime Minister ; both measures would require constitutional amendments . 
[PER Zardari  ] revealed that he also had leverage over [PER Shahbaz Sharif  ] , who through paperwork snafus , had been technically elected illegally for a third term as Chief Minister . 
This , too , would have to be resolved in parliament , [PER Zardari  ] said. “So I can give them something they want , ” noted [PER Zardari  ] , “that’s what politics is all about.” [PER Kayani Worried  ] -------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) After an August 20 meeting with visiting [ORG S/CT Coordinator Dell Dailey  ] , [PER Kayani  ] asked Ambassador to stay behind and discuss his concerns that [PER Zardari  ] was delaying [ORG ISLAMABAD  ] 00002802 002 OF 003 [PER Musharraf  ] , s immunity bill . 
[PER Kayani  ] had heard the large meeting of coalition partners ( chaired August 19 by the newly returned [PER Bilawal Bhutto  ] ) had discussed mostly the judges . 
Then they decided to take a 72-hour “break” to consult party members. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) As post earlier reported ( Reftels ) , [PER Kayani  ] said he took [PER Zardari  ] , s commitments to now ex-President [PER Musharraf  ] as the most important argument in persuading him to resign . 
[PER Zardari  ] made very specific commitments to [PER Kayani  ] . 
Now , for [PER Zardari  ] to delay , it makes him ( [PER Kayani  ] ) look bad within his own institution “and I have to bring the Army along with me.” [PER Kayani  ] also noted that the delay does nothing for [PER Zardari  ] , s reputation for trustworthiness . 
If this issue gets conflated with the judges and with [PER Zardari  ] , s own desires to be President , it will become too complicated to pass , [PER Kayani  ] said . 
[PER Gilani  ] on Immunity , [LOC Bajaur  ] , Subsidies ------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Ambassador met with PM [PER Gilani  ] and Interior Minister [PER Rehman Malik  ] for thirty minutes August 21 , after a graduation ceremony for [LOC U.S.  ] trained members of his protective detail . 
He had been briefed about PDAS Camp’s discussion with Ambassador [PER Haqqani.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Gilani  ] said the [ORG PPP  ] was going to provide immunity for ex-President [PER Musharraf  ] , but timing was important . 
They were afraid that putting forward immunity legislation would lose them votes for [PER Asif Zardari  ] , s presidential campaign . 
Ambassador pressed on this issue , saying that [PER Musharraf  ] would never have agreed to resign without the promise of immunity . 
He assured Ambassador that he and the party did not want vengeance . 
Regarding immunity , [PER Gilani  ] said “many will say that we have done a deal with [LOC America  ] , but still I understand that we have to do it.” <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Regarding the ongoing military operation on [LOC Bajaur  ] ( in the [LOC Federally Administered Tribal Areas  ] ) , [PER Gilani  ] assured Ambassador that it will continue “to its conclusion , ” i.e. , until all the militants were driven out . 
[PER Gilani  ] said the next step would be to go after [MISC Taliban  ] leader [PER Baitullah Mehsud  ] . 
[PER Gilani  ] wanted President [PER Bush  ] to know that over 500 militants had been killed in the operation and that the [MISC GOP  ] had reached out to [ORG NATO  ] ( during General [PER Kayani’s  ] recent visit to [LOC Afghanistan  ] for a tripartite meeting ) . 
He said [LOC Pakistan  ] would do everything possible to encourage cooperation between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Pakistani  ] militaries . 
[PER Gilani  ] noted that [LOC Pakistan  ] was using its [MISC F-16  ] aircraft to fight the militants and thanked the [LOC U.S.  ] for providing funding for the [MISC F-16  ] mid-life upgrades . 
However , [PER Gilani  ] pleaded for urgent [LOC U.S.  ] assistance in providing relief for displaced people around [LOC Bajaur  ] and noted that fighting was spreading to neighboring [PER Mohmand Agency.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Malik  ] suggested we hold off alleged Predator attacks until after the [LOC Bajaur  ] operation . 
The PM brushed aside [PER Rehman  ] , s remarks and said “I don , t care if they do it as long as they get the right people . 
We , ll protest in the [ORG National Assembly  ] and then ignore it.” ( Note: The strike has been front page news , but the media is reporting that the targets were nests of [MISC Arab  ] fighters . 
) <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Gilani  ] said it would be almost politically impossible to reduce fuel subsidies ( raise prices ) in the short term along the lines Deputy Secretary [PER Kimmitt  ] had suggested to the Finance Minister . 
The coalition had restoration of the deposed judges , immunity for [PER Musharraf  ] , and the election of the new president on their plate . 
They were already taking enormous heat for previous fuel price increases. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Nawaz  ] may increasingly be considering leaving the coalition in the center and consolidating his hold in the [ORG Punjab  ] because he cannot engineer a new general election in the short term . 
The addition of MQM’s support leaves [PER Nawaz  ] with less leverage over [PER Zardari  ] in the current coalition . 
The fight over [PER Iftikhar Chaudhry  ] probably is based on [MISC Nawaz’s  ] expectation that [PER Chaudhry  ] would rule in both [MISC Nawaz’s  ] and Shahbaz’s favor in pending court cases [ORG ISLAMABAD  ] 00002802 003 OF 003 challenging their ability to run as candidates in the [ORG National  ] and [ORG Punjab Assemblies  ] respectively . 
Until he can sit in the [ORG National Assembly  ] , [PER Nawaz  ] cannot be Prime Minister .
