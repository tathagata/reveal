END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
Following on his successful visits to [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] and [LOC Brasilia  ] , Secretary of Commerce [PER Carlos Gutierrez  ] visited [LOC Sao Paulo  ] June 7-8 . 
Members of the Secretary 's delegation included: [PER Robert Mosbacher  ] , Jr. , CEO , [ORG Overseas Private Investment Corporation  ] ( [ORG OPIC  ] ) ; [PER Steven Pinkos  ] , Deputy U/S for [ORG Intellectual Property  ] ; [PER David Bohigian  ] , A/S , [ORG Market Access and Compliance  ] ; [PER Patrick Duddy  ] , DAS , [LOC Western Hemisphere  ] , [ORG State Department  ] ; [PER Claire Buchan  ] , Chief of Staff ; [PER John Andersen  ] , Director , [ORG Latin America and Caribbean  ] ; [PER Dulce Zahniser  ] , [ORG OPIC  ] ; [PER Albert Angulo  ] , Trade and [ORG Development Agency  ] ( [ORG TDA  ] ) ; [PER Anne McKinney  ] , [ORG TDA  ] ; [PER Dan Nelson  ] , [ORG Office of Public Affairs  ] ; [PER Dorian Mazurkevich  ] , Patent and [ORG Trademark Office  ] ( [ORG PTO  ] ) ; [PER Phillip T. Chicola  ] , Charge d'Affaires , a.i. ; [PER Christopher J. McMullen  ] , Consul General ; and [PER John Harris  ] , Senior Commercial Officer ---------------------------- BREAKFAST WITH THE GOVERNORS ---------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
The Secretary attended a breakfast hosted by [LOC Sao Paulo  ] Governor [PER Claudio Lembo  ] and attended by three other state Governors: [PER Germano Rigotto  ] of [LOC Rio Grande  ] do Sul , [PER Eduardo Pinho Moreira  ] of [PER Santa Catarina  ] , and [PER Jose Orcirio Miranda  ] dos [PER Santos  ] ( " [PER Zeca  ] do PT " ) of [ORG Mato Grosso  ] do Sul . 
Two other Governors , [PER Roberto Requiao  ] of [LOC Parana  ] and [PER Aecio Neves  ] of [ORG Minas Gerais  ] , were invited but were unable to attend ; however , Governor [PER Neves  ] was represented by his State Secretary for [ORG Economic Development  ] , [PER Wilson Nelio Brumer  ] . 
Several of the Governors were accompanied by their chief foreign affairs advisors or state Commerce Secretaries . 
The discussion was very lively and constructive and focused on four major areas: intellectual property rights ( [ORG IPR  ] ) , investment and partnerships , facilitating commerce ( including the key role of [ORG OPIC  ] ) , and bilateral cooperation on biofuels. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
Leading off the breakfast , Secretary [PER Gutierrez  ] briefed governors on his meeting with Minister for [ORG Development  ] , Industry , and Foreign Trade Luiz [PER Fernando Furlan  ] and the launching of the [ORG U.S.-Brazil Commercial Dialogue  ] announced by Presidents [PER Bush  ] and [PER Lula  ] during the President 's visit to [LOC Brazil  ] last November . 
The Secretary noted that the [ORG Commercial Dialogue  ] would focus on facilitating trade by expediting customs , exchanging information that would benefit both sides , promoting [ORG IPR  ] , and working together on common standards . 
He said the [LOC U.S.  ] wants to strengthen bilateral commercial relations with [LOC Brazil  ] , work together to combat intellectual property piracy , promote two-way investment , and increase overall trade ( currently at around USD 45 billion , which he said should be higher ) . 
The Secretary observed that [LOC Brazil  ] profits more from trade with the SIPDIS [LOC U.S.  ] , which largely involves value-added products , than from trade with [LOC China  ] , which involves mostly commodities. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] Ambassador to the [LOC United States  ] [PER Roberto Abdenur  ] told the Governors that Secretary [PER Gutierrez  ] 's visit had been very productive , with excellent meetings with Minister [PER Furlan  ] and other senior GoB officials . 
He said the GoB will follow up with a visit to [LOC Washington  ] this fall to try to move forward on issues identified in these meetings . 
Minister [PER Furlan  ] is especially interested in making greater progress on biofuels , including increased cooperation on scientific research. ---------------------------- [ORG INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
Secretary [PER Gutierrez  ] congratulated the Governors on the progress to date in combating piracy , but urged them to do more . 
He observed that better [ORG IPR  ] enforcement would protect [MISC Brazilian  ] companies that are producing innovative products and would help attract greater [LOC U.S.  ] investment . 
[LOC Rio Grande  ] do Sul Governor [PER Germano Rigotto  ] stressed that all five states represented are taking strong measures to attack the [ORG IPR  ] piracy problem because they are aware of the economic equities they have in their states . 
For example , [ORG Dell  ] has a major facility in [PER Rigotto  ] 's state . 
He noted the need to do a better job of information-sharing regarding cross-border piracy -- where the merchandise is coming from , who is bringing it in , where is it going . 
[LOC Sao Paulo  ] Governor [PER Lembo  ] affirmed that the state governments have the political will to combat the problem and welcomed continuing [LOC U.S.  ] support . 
Yet there remains a public perception , noted [ORG Minas Gerais  ] State Secretary [PER Brumer  ] , that there is nothing wrong with piracy ; this complicates and impedes law enforcement efforts . 
Governor Pinho of [PER Santa Catarina  ] echoed [PER Rigotto  ] 's point about the need to combat piracy as key to achieving the goal of attracting more [LOC U.S.  ] investment . 
Governor [MISC Zeca  ] of [ORG Mato Grosso  ] do Sul , which has a long border with [LOC Paraguay  ] and [LOC Bolivia  ] , called for a stronger partnership with the [LOC U.S.  ] in the area of combating cross-border contraband. -------- BIOFUELS -------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
The Governors expressed great interest in the issue of developing biofuels . 
Several of the states , including [LOC Rio Grande  ] do Sul , are already intensifying their efforts in this area and are seeking partnerships . 
Speaking for the GoB , Ambassador [PER Abdenur  ] recognized the need for closer cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] and for more [LOC U.S.  ] investment in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
He suggested the two countries form a working group to focus on building a global partnership on ethanol . 
Both [PER Abdenur  ] and Governor [PER Lembo  ] called on the [LOC U.S.  ] to eliminate the 54-cent per gallon surcharge on imported ethanol . 
Secretary [PER Gutierrez  ] noted that President [PER Bush  ] has committed the [LOC U.S.  ] SIPDIS to developing alternative energy sources , including ethanol . 
This initiative opens up possibilities to work with [LOC Brazil  ] . 
There are [LOC U.S.  ] investors who would be interested in working with [MISC Brazilian  ] companies in developing this area . 
Bilateral cooperation in this area would benefit both sides . 
The Secretary said the [LOC U.S.  ] could learn something in this area since [LOC Brazil  ] is far ahead of the [LOC U.S.  ] in alternative energy . 
He promised to take the biofuels question back to [LOC Washington  ] with him. ------------------------- [ORG INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT  ] ------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
The Governors then raised the question of [LOC Brazil  ] 's critical need for infrastructure improvement and the GoB 's public-private partnership ( PPP ) Program . 
Governor [PER Rigotto  ] noted that all five states have the necessary legislation in place to implement PPPs , but the [ORG National Bank for Economic and Social Development  ] ( [ORG BNDES  ] ) needs to help facilitate financing of large infrastructure projects . 
Several others chimed in , pointing out that it is difficult for states and municipalities to find funds for big infrastructure projects . 
They are looking for partnerships with [LOC U.S.  ] entities . 
For example , [ORG Minas Gerais  ] has three big projects that would welcome [LOC U.S.  ] investments -- highways , prisons , and basic sanitation facilities . 
In this context , CEO [PER Mosbacher  ] explained the role of [ORG OPIC  ] in supporting [LOC U.S.  ] investors interested in infrastructure projects , particularly housing for low- and medium- income families . 
He also underscored the importance of facilitating licenses and permits for such investments . 
Several of the governors present indicated their interest in such programs , and [PER Mosbacher  ] committed to following up with them to outline possible housing programs and infrastructure activities in their states. ------------------ TRADE FACILITATION ------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
In the area of trade facilitation , Senior Commercial Officer [PER John Harris  ] urged the Governors to promote greater participation in [LOC U.S.  ] trade shows , and offered to facilitate broader [MISC Brazilian  ] participation . 
Governor [PER Rigotto  ] replied that the states would very much like to take advantage of these trade shows and asked that FCS provide information early enough to allow state governments to get word out to companies. ---------- ANTI-PIRACY [PER COMMITTEE  ] MEETING ------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
Following the breakfast , the Secretary and the Governors met with the [LOC Sao Paulo  ] State [ORG Anti-Piracy Committee  ] , a group formed in January of this year by then Governor ( and now Presidential candidate ) [PER Geraldo Alckmin  ] . 
The [ORG Committee  ] is composed of the Governor , his Chief of Staff , the Attorney General , and six State Secretaries ( Justice ; Finance ; Public Security ; Labor ; Culture ; and Science , Technology , and [ORG Economic Development  ] ) and members of their staffs . 
[LOC Sao Paulo  ] is the second state to create an anti-piracy committee ; the first was [LOC Rio Grande  ] do Sul , whose committee includes representatives of the private sector as well . 
The [ORG Sao Paulo Committee  ] was created in response to strong and energetic advocacy by the [ORG Consulate.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
[LOC Sao Paulo  ] State Attorney General Elival da [PER Silva Ramos  ] began by commenting on the importance of public and private participation in fighting copyright piracy . 
He criticized the federal government for its inability to control the traffic of pirated goods at the borders and ports . 
He also commented on the deleterious effects of piracy in terms of lost tax revenue , competitiveness , and innovation . 
The State Secretary of Finance , [PER Luiz Tacca Junior  ] , commented on the state of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] 's capacity to attack counterfeit goods , focusing on a recent campaign against what the state government calls " counterfeit fuel " - watered down ethanol and gasoline . 
Recent successes in combating adulterated fuel were attributed to a successful public education campaign , aggressive prosecution of traffickers in diluted fuel , and stricter licensing requirements and closer state scrutiny of fuel distributors . 
[PER Tacca  ] was grateful for cooperation received from the [LOC U.S.  ] in training the state 's Fiscal Intelligence Unit , which has become an effective police unit in the fight against money laundering . 
[PER Tacca  ] emphasized the lost revenue angle , noting that much can be done to fight piracy on the tax evasion side of law enforcement . 
He concluded by acknowledging that much work remains to be done in terms of encouraging businesses to participate in the " legal economy . 
" [LOC Brazil  ] 's rampant tax evasion , off-the-books transactions , and under-invoicing make it critical for the government to offer incentives for gray market and " irregular " businesses to enter the formal economy and operate within the law. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
At this point , Attorney General [PER Ramos  ] noted that [LOC Sao Paulo  ] is at the legal limit in terms of its power to enforce [ORG IPR  ] . 
In [LOC Brazil  ] 's federal system , all criminal legislation , including in the area of intellectual property , is made at the national level . 
The state 's only real power to fight piracy comes from the state tax laws . 
This is the only angle that allows [LOC Sao Paulo  ] to act above and beyond the federally mandated guidelines . 
Nevertheless , [LOC Sao Paulo  ] will remain active in pursuing tax evaders as a means of inhibiting counterfeiting. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
Following [PER Tacca  ] 's remarks , [LOC Sao Paulo  ] State Deputy Secretary for Public Security , [PER Marcelo Martins de Oliveira  ] , gave an overview of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] 's recent successes in fighting piracy . 
[PER Oliveira  ] praised the police department 's organized crime division ( [ORG DEIC  ] ) , which includes a unit dedicated to piracy , or crimes against " immaterial property . 
" This unit has recently conducted 1,812 operations , resulting in 4,500 indictments , 2,103 prosecutions , and over 400 imprisonments . 
[ORG DEIC  ] raids have netted 3.7 million toys , 8.16 million CDs and DVDs , 300,000 tennis shoes , 400,000 watches , and 450,000 pieces of counterfeit clothing . 
[PER Oliveira  ] concluded by saying that despite [ORG DEIC  ] 's excellent track record , piracy will be an unsolvable problem until the federal government is better able to control its ports and borders . 
Nevertheless , [LOC Sao Paulo  ] 's police force is " unequivocally " dedicated to the continued fight against piracy . 
[PER Oliveira  ] concluded by personally thanking the [LOC U.S.  ] Consulate General in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] for its " invaluable and unceasing assistance in the fight against piracy and drug trafficking . 
" <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
Secretary of Culture [PER Joao Batista  ] was the next to comment on the ills of piracy in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] . 
[PER Batista  ] criticized piracy as an attack on [MISC Brazilian  ] culture , specifically in the music market , where 75 percent of music sales in [LOC Brazil  ] are of works by national artists and 52 percent of those are of counterfeit products . 
In contrast with music sales , the [MISC Brazilian  ] film market is dominated by foreign films . 
Nevertheless , piracy is still a threat to [MISC Brazilian  ] cinema . 
To reinforce the reality of this threat , [PER Batista  ] recounted the story of a pirated DVD version of the [MISC Brazilian  ] blockbuster movie " [MISC Dois Filhos  ] de [PER Francisco  ] " being watched aboard [MISC Brazilian  ] President [PER Lula  ] 's executive airplane . 
[ NOTE: Perhaps the most important , certainly the most popular film ever made in [LOC Brazil  ] , " [PER Francisco  ] 's Two [MISC Sons  ] " was [LOC Brazil  ] 's top grossing film at the box office in 2005 . 
Filmed on a budget of less than USD 3 million , it outperformed several of the top twenty highest grossing films of all time , worldwide . 
" [PER Francisco  ] 's Two [MISC Sons  ] " was also nominated for an [PER Oscar  ] in the international film category . 
END NOTE . 
] [PER Batista  ] cited the failure of the federal government to secure the borders as the prime culprit behind the large market for pirated material in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] . 
He then reiterated the need for cooperation between state and federal authorities on this issue. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
Governor [PER Lembo  ] issued an invitation for the [LOC U.S.  ] Consul General to participate in the periodic meetings of the [LOC Sao Paulo  ] Anti-Piracy Council . 
He extended the invitation to other consulate staff to attend the public hearings of the council . 
Executive Secretary of the [LOC Sao Paulo  ] state [ORG Anti-Piracy Committee  ] Marco [PER Vaz Guimaraes de Souza Netto  ] then outlined the [ORG Committee  ] 's approach to the issue . 
The [ORG Committee  ] , which convened for the first time in May of this year , has the following priorities: pursuing tax evasion , cracking down on money laundering , improving the warehousing of seized goods , and perfecting the logistics of combating piracy -- meaning developing the process from seizure of goods through prosecution to storage and ultimate destruction . 
[PER Netto  ] noted that many warehouses are currently donated by anti-piracy groups , such as , for example , the [ORG Motions Picture Association  ] ; however , warehouse capacity will soon be outstripped by the tidal wave of incoming seized contraband. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
Echoing the State Secretary of Culture , Governor [PER Rigotto  ] complained that the federal government 's inability to effectively police the borders was responsible for the problems of piracy arriving on the " our states' " doorsteps . 
Noting that two of the states represented at the meeting - his own ( which borders on [LOC Argentina  ] and [LOC Uruguay  ] ) and [ORG Mato Grosso  ] do Sul - bordered on other countries and that several others were home to major ports , he then made the bold suggestion that the Governors present form a working group comprised of the Secretaries in each government responsible for combating piracy , including the Secretaries of Finance , Security , and Culture , among others . 
While recognizing that the states bordering on [LOC Paraguay  ] ( [ORG Mato Grosso  ] do Sul ; [LOC Parana  ] was not represented at the meeting ) face the largest challenges , [PER Rigotto  ] pointed out that the products that cross through these states ultimately end up on the streets of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] and elsewhere. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
[ORG Mato Grosso  ] Do Sul Governor [PER Miranda dos Santos  ] ( [PER Zeca  ] do PT ) immediately seized on this idea , saying the border states and major markets could help each other immensely . 
He noted that counterfeit fuel from [LOC Sao Paulo  ] is sold in [ORG Mato Grosso  ] do Sul , and that drugs from [LOC Bolivia  ] and [LOC Paraguay  ] make their way through his state to [LOC Sao SAO PAULO  ] 00000675 006 OF 008 [LOC Paulo  ] . 
Thus , they had a lot to learn from each other and much to gain by coordinating efforts . 
Governor [PER Zeca  ] thanked the [LOC U.S.  ] for its helpful drug enforcement presence in [LOC Paraguay  ] and [LOC Bolivia  ] and called for a greater [LOC U.S.  ] presence in the [MISC Brazilian  ] border states themselves . 
[PER Santa Catarina  ] Governor [PER Pinho  ] denied that his state had a large problem with piracy but expressed a willingness to participate in a regional working group . 
He also noted that [PER Santa Catarina  ] 's [ORG Federation of Industries  ] ( [ORG FIESC  ] ) has great expertise to lend in this area. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
Secretary [PER Gutierrez  ] thanked everyone for their comments and stated that in order to better fight piracy , we need better information . 
For example , it would be good to know how much illicit material is being produced locally and how much is being imported , and from where . 
In the [LOC United States  ] , 70 percent of all counterfeit goods come from [LOC China  ] ; this is a useful figure for us to have when making policies to fight piracy . 
He asked the participants to share information they may have with him . 
In response , Governor [PER Germano Rigotto  ] clarified that most of [LOC Brazil  ] 's pirated goods comes from [LOC China  ] via [LOC Paraguay  ] and enters through weakly policed ports and borders in the form of textiles , computer software and hardware , CDs , and DVDs . 
He noted that all counterfeit cigarettes in [LOC Brazil  ] are manufactured in [LOC Paraguay  ] , with falsified brand names . 
No counterfeit cigarettes are made in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
There is , however , a large counterfeit computer industry in [LOC Brazil  ] , for which all manufacturing takes place locally . 
[PER Rigotto  ] advocated that the states play a stronger role in breaking up these illegal businesses. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
Commerce Deputy Under Secretary [PER Stephen Pinkos  ] of the Patent and [ORG Trademark Office  ] then commented that [LOC Brazil  ] is to be congratulated on its recent successes in combating piracy . 
He also highlighted training programs currently being conducted in [LOC Brazil  ] by the [ORG Department of Homeland Security  ] and the [ORG Department of Justice  ] . 
[PER Pinkos  ] then described the success the [LOC U.S.  ] has had in organizing federal task forces , which combine federal , state , and local police efforts to combat piracy , even though ultimately the charges that will be brought are federal . 
He suggested that the [LOC U.S.  ] could work with [LOC Brazil  ] to share experiences from this model and help [MISC Brazilian  ] authorities implement a similar framework to fight piracy . 
He also emphasized the health costs of piracy , which go beyond lost tax revenue and unfair competition . 
Ten percent of medication worldwide is counterfeited , as are many auto parts . 
The public safety ramifications of this phenomenon are sobering and need to receive wider public attention. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
Governor [PER Lembo  ] closed the [ORG Roundtable suggesting  ] that the [ORG Governors' respective Chiefs  ] of Staff contact each other to set up a sub-regional working group meeting . 
[PER Lembo  ] offered to host the meeting in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , and suggested that the first meeting occur in the latter half of July , adding , " After the [MISC World Cup  ] , of course . 
" --------------------- VISIT TO [ORG SENAC CENTER  ] --------------------- <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
Secretary [PER Gutierrez  ] next visited a branch of the [ORG National Commercial Apprenticeship Service  ] ( [ORG SENAC  ] ) . 
[ORG SENAC  ] is a University system begun in 1946 with the support of different [ORG Federations of Industry  ] , including [ORG FIESP  ] , which wanted to begin a system of schools that would increase the country 's stock of technically trained students . 
[ORG SENAC  ] has 56 units in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] State alone . 
The Secretary , Consul General , and [ORG Senior Commercial  ] Officer were [ORG SIPDIS  ] greeted by [PER Joao Kulcsar  ] , Director of the [ORG U.S. Study Center  ] ; [PER Abram Szajman  ] , President of [ORG SENAC  ] and of the [ORG Federation of Commerce  ] for [LOC Sco Paulo  ] ; and [PER Emelio Umeoka  ] , President of [ORG Microsoft  ] . 
The group toured [ORG SENAC  ] 's library , where they were given an overview of [ORG SENAC  ] 's activities and resources , and then went across campus to [ORG Microsoft  ] 's [ORG Center of Innovation  ] learning center . 
[PER Umeoka  ] provided an overview of [ORG Microsoft  ] 's investment in youth education and the goals of the [ORG Innovation Center  ] , as well as a summary of other [ORG Microsoft  ] corporate responsibility programs in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Following a photo with some of the [ORG Center  ] 's students , the Secretary and others were escorted to a classroom , where they spent 30 minutes speaking to twelve students in a roundtable format about their different classes , incubator businesses , and hopes for future employment . 
A brief interview with [ORG SENAC  ] 's internal television station followed , and [PER Szajman  ] and [PER Umeoka  ] and other [ORG SENAC  ] representatives took their leave of the Secretary and his delegation. ------------------- POSITIVE PRESS PLAY ------------------- <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
Media coverage of the visit was generally positive , comprehensive and objective . 
There was much press interest in the Secretary - both his morning press conference with the Governors and [ORG SIPDIS  ] his late afternoon media roundtable , as well as his speech at [LOC AmCham  ] , were covered by all major dailies , all TV networks , business dailies and newsweeklies , and wire services . 
The questions he received from [MISC Brazilian  ] journalists at the roundtable were probing and well-informed , but neither hostile nor friendly . 
The Secretary 's statements were accurately represented , and the main [ORG SIPDIS  ] points that he emphasized - greater [MISC Inter-American  ] commercial and trade cooperation and integration ; viewing [LOC China  ] and [LOC India  ] not only as potential markets , but also competitors ; highlighting the positive steps that have been taken to combat piracy , but noting that more remains to be done - were covered . 
" [ORG Folha de Sao Paulo  ] , " the largest circulation daily newspaper , noted that he didn't mention FTAA in public at all , but seemed to focus more on bilateral efforts . 
The reporting was much more factual than analytical . 
Overall , the reporting was comprehensive , fair , and , on balance , positive. ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
This was a highly successful visit that advanced key aspects of our economic and commercial agenda . 
The Secretary brought with him a clear , coherent message on the [ORG USG  ] 's trade policies and priorities , and he delivered it effectively to state government officials , business leaders , and the omnipresent [MISC Brazilian  ] Ambassador . 
He also demonstrated a keen awareness of [MISC Brazilian  ] concerns on trade issues as well as a willingness to listen . 
If , in the aftermath of his visit , [MISC Brazilian  ] federal and state law enforcement agencies actually implement their proposal to communicate better with each other on issues related to combating [ORG IPR  ] piracy , the visit will have accomplished something tangible and positive for both sides . 
END COMMENT . 
This cable was coordinated/cleared with [ORG Embassy Brasilia  ] .
