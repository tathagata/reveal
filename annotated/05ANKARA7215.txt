( C ) Summary: Despite media reports and opposition rumors of splits among PM [PER Erdogan  ] 's Justice and [ORG Development Party  ] 's ( [ORG AKP  ] ) 357 parliamentarians , the group remains intact ) - for now . 
Among [ORG AKP  ] MPs , there are distinctive pious , pragmatic and nationalist currents , with crosscutting personal loyalties . 
Recent events in [LOC Turkey  ] 's heavily-Kurdish southeast have heightened tensions between [ORG AKP  ] , s [MISC Kurdish-origin MPs  ] and the rest of the parliamentary group . 
While [ORG AKP  ] MPs , numbers may slowly erode over the next year ( ref A ) , a major split is unlikely as long as [ORG AKP  ] -- and in particular PM [PER Erdogan  ] -- retain power and popularity . 
End Summary . 
Despite Wishful Thinking , [ORG AKP  ] Not Crumbling Yet --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Over the past year , the [MISC Turkish  ] press has repeatedly predicted open splits in the 357-member [ORG AKP  ] parliamentary group . 
While [ORG AKP  ] has ideological and personality-based fault lines , there appears to be little chance of a major split while [ORG AKP  ] remains [LOC Turkey  ] , s number one party and [PER Erdogan  ] the country , s most popular politician . 
Even [LOC Ankara  ] [ORG AKP  ] MP [PER Ersonmez Yarbay  ] , a maverick frequently openly critical of his own party , downplayed to us the rumors of party splits , saying they have been fueled by the opposition to force early elections . 
[ORG AKP  ] , s Ideological Currents -------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG AKP  ] , s parliamentary group is composed of politicians with widely differing viewpoints . 
There are three main ideological currents: pious , nationalist and pragmatic . 
Most [ORG AKP  ] MPs do not fall neatly into any one category , and personal loyalties crosscut ideology , mostly among pious MPs . 
Pious ----- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Almost all [ORG AKP  ] MPs are religiously observant to some degree ; for example , the vast majority fast during [MISC Ramadan  ] . 
However , there is a large and distinctively more pious group of [MISC MPs  ] , comprising former members of the banned [ORG Islamist Virtue  ] ( Fazilet ) Party , former members of the [ORG National View Islamist  ] youth group , and members of a wide range of ( officially banned ) [MISC Muslim  ] brotherhoods . 
Most of [ORG AKP  ] , s top leaders fall into this group: PM [PER Erdogan  ] , DPM/FM [PER Abdullah Gul  ] , parliament Speaker Arinc , Vice Speaker [PER Alptekin  ] ( former PM and [ORG Islamic Saadet Party  ] head [ORG Erbakan  ] 's right-hand man ) and all five of [ORG AKP  ] , s parliamentary whips . 
Pious [MISC MPs  ] generally represent the central [MISC Anatolian  ] heartland , speak no [MISC English  ] , and have traveled little. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) While most [MISC Turkish Islamists  ] oppose the [ORG EU  ] , [ORG AKP  ] , s [MISC Islamist MPs  ] toe the [ORG AKP  ] line and support it , albeit less enthusiastically since October 3 . 
Typical of [MISC Turkish  ] [MISC Islamists  ] , they dislike [LOC Turkey  ] , s military and have no ties to it other than their required military service . 
Attitudes about the [LOC U.S.  ] vary widely , from friendly to suspicious , but most favor better ties with the [MISC Muslim  ] world . 
Although the GOT , under [PER Erdogan  ] , s leadership , has taken a politically courageous public stand favoring privatization and foreign investment , many pious [MISC MPs  ] oppose both. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG AKP  ] , s pious [MISC MPs  ] are widely rumored to be deeply unhappy about PM [PER Erdogan  ] , s inability to ease restrictions on the wearing of headscarves and on religious schools . 
However , since [ORG AKP  ] came to power in November 2002 , no [ORG AKP  ] MP has resigned and gone over to the Happiness ( Saadet ) Party , on [ORG AKP  ] 's [MISC Islamist  ] flank . 
Nationalists ------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) It is hard to find a [MISC Turk  ] who is not nationalistic . 
Yet a significant number of [ORG AKP  ] MPs ( as many as 50 , according to one former [ORG MP  ] ) , many of them former members of the ultra-nationalist [ORG National Action Party  ] ( [ORG MHP  ] ) or center-right [ORG True Path Party  ] ( [ORG DYP  ] ) , are strong nationalists , even by [MISC Turkish  ] standards . 
This group includes Justice Minister and party spokesman [PER Cemil Cicek  ] , Deputy PM [PER Abdullatif Sener  ] , State Minister [PER Kursad Tuzmen  ] , and parliament Vice Speaker [PER Sadik Yakut.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Among [ORG AKP  ] [MISC MPs  ] , nationalists take the hardest line against &concessions8 to the [ORG EU  ] and on [LOC Cyprus  ] . 
MFA officials have told us on several occasions that the GOT is delaying bringing the [ORG Ankara Agreement  ] extension protocol to parliament for ratification out of concern for the reaction of nationalist [ORG AKP  ] MPs ( ref B ) . 
Nationalist [ORG AKP  ] MPs are deeply suspicious about the motives of [LOC Turkey  ] , s ethnic [MISC Kurds  ] and were vocal critics of PM [PER Erdogan  ] , s August declaration in [LOC Diyarbakir  ] that [LOC Turkey  ] has a &Kurdish problem.8 Like their pious colleagues , nationalists , attitudes about the [LOC U.S.  ] vary widely , from friendly to suspicious . 
However , even pro-U.S. nationalists become extremely prickly at any perceived [LOC U.S.  ] slight to [MISC Turkish  ] national honor . 
Pragmatists ----------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [ORG AKP  ] , s pragmatic [MISC MPs  ] generally speak [MISC English  ] , are foreign-educated , and tend to be better-traveled than their colleagues . 
They often come from large cosmopolitan areas , particularly [LOC Ankara  ] or [LOC Istanbul  ] ; some were previously members of the center-right [ORG Motherland Party  ] ( [ORG ANAP  ] ) . 
Three of [ORG AKP  ] , s five vice chairs , who frequently deal with foreigners , are from the pragmatic wing: [PER Bulent Gedikli  ] , [PER Reha Denemec  ] and [PER Saban Disli  ] . 
All are [MISC U.S-educated  ] and represent either [LOC Istanbul  ] or [LOC Ankara  ] . 
The same is true for pragmatic [PER Erdogan  ] translator and foreign policy advisor [PER Egemen Bagis  ] , who accompanies the PM on his trips to [LOC Europe  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Although the pragmatic MPs are often [ORG AKP  ] , s most visible face to foreigners , they have less influence inside [ORG AKP  ] than their pious and nationalist colleagues . 
In early 2005 , there were signs of frustration among [ORG AKP  ] , s moderates , when a spate of [ORG AKP  ] MP resignations went mostly to [ORG ANAP  ] . 
Culture Minister [PER Mumcu  ] , [ORG AKP  ] , s highest-profile resignation who went on become [ORG ANAP  ] , s Chairman , said publicly he had only felt like a &guest8 in [ORG AKP  ] ( ref C ) . <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Erdogan  ] can ill afford to lose the pragmatists . 
In addition to giving [ORG AKP  ] a reasonable , big-tent image that plays well in the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Europe  ] , [ORG AKP  ] , s pragmatists are links to [LOC Istanbul  ] and [LOC Ankara  ] elites . 
These [MISC MPs  ] are [ORG AKP  ] , s friendliest face toward the [LOC U.S  ] . 
( [PER Bagis  ] heads parliament , s [ORG Turkey/U.S Friendship Committee  ] ) , and most receptive to liberal political and open market economic reforms needed for [ORG EU  ] accession . 
Crosscutting Personal Loyalties ------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [ORG AKP  ] [MISC MPS  ] are as divided by personality as by politics , but personality-based fault lines crosscut ideological ones . 
PM [PER Erdogan  ] is the glue that holds [ORG AKP  ] together ; a chunk of [ORG AKP  ] MPs were part of [PER Erdogan  ] , s team when he was [LOC Istanbul  ] mayor and have followed him onto the national stage . 
They include Finance Minister [PER Unakitan  ] , Transportation Minister [LOC Yildirim  ] , State Minister [LOC Cubukcu  ] , [ORG AKP  ] whip [PER Irfan Gunduz  ] , and [PER Erdogan  ] speechwriter [PER Huseyin Besli  ] . 
All are personally pious or , in [LOC Cubukcu  ] , s case , at least have consistently supported positions of the party , s pious wing . 
[LOC Cubukcu  ] , a female , was one of the few [MISC MPs  ] who publicly supported [PER Erdogan  ] , s 2004 proposal to re-criminalize adultery. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Erdogan  ] has consistently protected all three " [LOC Istanbul  ] " Ministers despite repeated calls for their resignation . 
Many other [ORG AKP  ] [MISC MPs  ] profess staunch loyalty to &Tayyip Bey8 and seek to stay close to him . 
One contact suggests that [PER Erdogan  ] 's strategy is to keep subordinates competing with each other for his attention so they are too busy to be a threat to him. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) DPM/FM [PER Gul  ] remains [PER Erdogan  ] , s chief political rival within [ORG AKP  ] . 
Their differences are not ideological ) [PER Gul  ] and [PER Erdogan  ] are both pious ) but spring from [PER Gul  ] , s ambitions for greater power . 
[PER Gul  ] , who represents the parliamentary faction of the banned [ORG Virtue Party  ] , has a small , quiet following among [LOC AK  ] [MISC MPs  ] that includes whip [PER Salih Kapusuz  ] ( from [PER Gul  ] , s home town of [LOC Kayseri  ] ) , former [ORG AKP  ] public relations vice chair [PER Murat Mercan  ] ( sacked for incompetence by [PER Erdogan  ] earlier this year ) and [PER Taner Yildiz  ] ( also from [LOC Kayseri  ] ) . <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Parliament Speaker [PER Arinc  ] is [ORG AKP  ] , s third leading personality and potential future rival to [PER Erdogan  ] . 
However , [PER Arinc  ] is well behind [PER Gul  ] in influence and , according to our contacts , currently without a significant group of [ORG MP  ] loyalists . 
[ORG AKP  ] 's [MISC Kurdish  ] MPs ----------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) About 60 [ORG AKP  ] MPs , mostly from [LOC Turkey  ] , s southeast , are of [MISC Kurdish  ] origin ; Political and [ORG Legal Affairs Vice Chair  ] Dengir Mir Firat is [ORG AKP  ] 's most visible [MISC Kurdish  ] [ORG MP  ] . 
The [MISC Kurds  ] who joined [ORG AKP  ] and were elected to parliament tend to be pious , stressing the common bonds among all [MISC Muslims  ] over [MISC Kurdish  ] nationalism . 
( The strongest [MISC Kurdish  ] nationalists ran from the [ORG pro-Kurdish Democratic People  ] , s [ORG Party (  ] [ORG DEHAP  ] ) in 2002 elections and failed to enter parliament because [ORG DEHAP  ] did not cross the ten percent electoral threshold . 
) One former [MISC Kurdish-origin  ] [ORG MP  ] , himself pious , has consistently told us even he considers [ORG AKP  ] , s [MISC Kurdish  ] MPs extraordinarily passive on [MISC Kurdish  ] issues. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) Yet recent events in the southeast , including [ORG AKP  ] nationalists' reaction against PM [PER Erdogan  ] , s August &Kurdish problem8 speech in [LOC Diyarbakir  ] and alleged [ORG Jandarma  ] involvement in a November bombing in the southeastern town of [LOC Semdinli  ] , have created tension between [ORG AKP  ] , s [MISC Kurdish-origin  ] MPs and the rest of the parliamentary group . 
An [LOC Ankara  ] provincial [ORG AKP  ] official told us recently that tension with [ORG AKP  ] , s [MISC Kurdish-origin  ] MPs has infected [ORG AKP  ] 's pious wing , weakening it relative to other [ORG AKP  ] factions. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) Comment: [ORG AKP  ] 's parliamentary strength , so far , springs from [PER Erdogan  ] 's ability to keep such a diverse group of [MISC MPs  ] united , and the lack of any viable opposition . 
The question is whether [PER Erdogan  ] can continue to keep the parliamentary group together without turning [ORG AKP  ] into an internally-undemocratic , personality-based party in the classic [MISC Turkish  ] tradition . 
[ORG AKP  ] , s opposition will eventually come from inside [ORG AKP  ] itself . 
However , for now , [ORG Erodgan  ] appears well in control and there is no viable political alternative for dissatisfied [ORG AKP  ] [MISC MPs  ] .
