( [ORG SBU  ] ) S/CRS Coordinator Ambassador [PER John Herbst  ] visited [LOC Brasilia  ] May 21 for consultations with the [LOC GOB  ] on [LOC Brazil  ] 's growing stabilization capabilities and possibilities for future cooperation . 
In meetings with [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Ministry for External Relations  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) and [ORG Brazilian Agency for Cooperation  ] ( [ORG ABC  ] - [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG USAID  ] equivalent ) , [PER Herbst  ] outlined S/CRS structures and capabilities and compared them to elements of [LOC Brazil  ] 's own experience leading the [ORG UN  ] peacekeeping mission in [LOC Haiti  ] ( [ORG MINUSTAH  ] ) . 
[PER Herbst  ] noted that the change in [LOC Brazil  ] 's approach in [LOC Haiti  ] over the past two years , from simply providing peacekeepers to taking responsibility for building sustainable communities , mirrored [ORG S/CRS  ] 's approach . 
[ORG MRE  ] Under Secretary for Political Affairs [PER Vera Machado  ] described the situation in [LOC Haiti  ] as " fragile stability " and said [MISC Brazilian  ] efforts to maintain peaceful conditions and improve police training had met with some success but were undermined by a lack of resources resulting from a " disappointing " donors conference. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Herbst  ] suggested that possibilities for cooperation between [LOC Brazil  ] and the [LOC United States  ] will grow over the next twenty to thirty years as more states could destabilize over that period . 
He told the [MISC Brazilians  ] that while the [ORG USG  ] was not recommending involvement in any specific crisis , it seemed natural to enhance bilateral consultations on stabilization , so that when [LOC Brazil  ] decided its interests would be served by involvement in a crisis operation , it would be prepared . 
Peacebuilding in failed states was difficult , he said , with only a few positive examples to guide future efforts . 
[PER Herbst  ] cited [LOC Colombia  ] 's success in restoring government control to areas like the [LOC Macarena  ] which had previously been under [ORG FARC  ] control . 
[PER Herbst  ] also spoke of [MISC S/CRS'  ] role in planning for [LOC Kosovo  ] 's transition to independent government as an example of stabilization work . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] interest in promoting stability in [LOC Africa  ] offered possibilities for cooperative approaches to prevent states from failing . 
[PER Herbst  ] then offered to invite [MISC Brazilians  ] to participate in S/CRS-developed training programs , either in [LOC Washington  ] or online . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] Director for [ORG International Organizations Carlos Duarte  ] agreed that there was scope for greater cooperation in [LOC Haiti  ] and in [LOC Africa  ] , particularly in [LOC Guinea  ] [ORG Bissau.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG ABC  ] Director [PER Marco Farani  ] showed a strong interest in participating in S/CRS training . 
Within a day of meeting [PER Herbst  ] , he had his office call Embassy [LOC Brasilia  ] for information on the upcoming course . 
[PER Farani  ] explained that while [ORG ABC  ] had previously lacked resources , he was expecting a budget increase and authority to hire forty additional personnel this year . 
[PER Herbst  ] suggested using the [LOC India-Brazil-South Africa  ] ( [ORG IBSA  ] ) consultative mechanism to encourage interest in stabilization operations and said the [MISC Indians  ] had previously expressed interest in such consultations . 
[PER Farani  ] also believed there were possibilities for cooperation in [LOC Guinea Bissau  ] and elsewhere in [LOC Africa  ] . 
He agreed that the [ORG African Union  ] was a potentially valuable partner and asked when [ORG S/CRS  ] would be able to send experts to help the [ORG AU  ] develop its capabilities. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) COMMENT . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is a latecomer to the area of reconstruction and stabilization , having been initially reluctant to become involved in [LOC Haiti  ] . 
As [LOC Brazil  ] 's view of itself as a world power develops , so is its understanding of the responsibilities that come with a larger global role . 
[ORG ABC  ] clearly is more forward-leaning in this regard than is the [ORG MRE  ] , but President [PER Lula  ] 's emphasis on outreach to [LOC Africa  ] has created openings for engagement with [LOC Brazil  ] on promoting stability on that continent . 
The [ORG S/CRS  ] approach that [LOC Brazil  ] should decide where and when to be involved , with the [ORG USG  ] willing to cooperate when appropriate , was particularly effective with the [ORG MRE  ] , which is typically wary of [LOC U.S.  ] requests to get involved in third countries. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Ambassador [PER Herbst  ] has cleared this cable .
