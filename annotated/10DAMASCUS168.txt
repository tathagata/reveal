End Summary -------------------------------------- [MISC Miqdad: Direct Your Message  ] to [LOC Israel  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Charge and Pol/Econ Chief delivered [MISC Ref A  ] demarche to [MISC Syrian  ] Vice Foreign Minister ( V/FM ) [PER Faisal  ] al-Miqdad on February 25 . 
A clearly surprised [PER Miqdad  ] listened attentively and took detailed notes , interrupting twice to confirm whether the demarche concerned the transfer of ballistic missiles and to clarify whether the message represented a [LOC U.S.  ] or an [MISC Israeli  ] “warning.” Charge explained the message reflected [LOC Washington  ] concerns that [PER SEMEP Mitchell  ] and [PER U/S Burns  ] had shared previously with President [PER Asad  ] . 
Addressing the substance of the demarche , [PER Miqdad  ] argued that [LOC Israel  ] itself could not have sent a stronger warning . 
The message , he continued , “shows the [LOC U.S.  ] has not come to a mature position ( that would enable it ) to differentiate between its own interests and [ORG Israel’s.” Syria  ] was “of course” not in the mood to increase tensions or escalate , “because we believe in peace.” Toward that end , [LOC Syria  ] was doing its best with [LOC Turkey  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] to achieve peace . 
[LOC Syria  ] was not taking steps to escalate . 
Unless [LOC Israel  ] had plans to escalate against [LOC Syria  ] or [LOC Lebanon  ] , “there’s no need to worry , ” said [PER Miqdad.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Referring to [ORG Hizballah  ] Secretary General [PER Hassan Nasrallah’s  ] February 16 speech , [PER Miqdad  ] emphasized that [ORG Hizballah  ] was responding to [MISC Israeli  ] threats and clearly conveyed Hizballah’s intent to respond only if [LOC Israel  ] attacked first . 
[LOC Syria  ] believed in and supported the role of [ORG UNIFIL  ] , and was using its contacts with the [MISC Lebanese  ] Government to “insist” on Lebanon’s full cooperation with [ORG UNIFIL  ] . 
[PER Miqdad  ] insisted [LOC Israel  ] , not [LOC Syria  ] or [LOC Lebanon  ] , was issuing provocative threats and using [ORG Hizballah  ] as a pretext . 
The [MISC Syrian  ] government had been pleased to hear [MISC Lebanese  ] PM Hariri’s remarks expressing concerns about [MISC Israeli  ] provocation , including the violation of [MISC Lebanese  ] airspace and assassinations . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] message , summed up [PER Miqdad  ] , “should be directed to [LOC Israel  ] not to escalate.” ---------------------------------------- Denial of [ORG Supply of Weapons  ] to [ORG Hizballah  ] ---------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Charge replied that the [LOC U.S.  ] message had come in the context of improving bilateral relations , which depended on a frank and candid exchange of assessments of regional developments . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] was issuing neither threats nor ultimatums , but rather it sought to convey what it believed to be a shared interest in avoiding conflict . 
[PER Miqdad  ] commented that it was “strange” the [LOC U.S.  ] had chosen to deliver “harsh words while we’re trying to build better relations.” He promised to convey the message to his superiors but reiterated Syria’s desire to avoid escalation. “You may hear about weapons going to [ORG Hizballah  ] , ” he claimed , “but they are absolutely not coming through [MISC Syria.” The  ] real threat to stability was coming from [MISC Israeli  ] officials who had threatened recently to attack [LOC Damascus  ] and to change the [MISC Syrian  ] regime. “Please convey to [LOC Washington  ] , while we take note of your demarche , this message should be directed at [LOC Israel  ] , ” he said. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Charge replied that , as [PER U/S Burns  ] had conveyed to President [PER Asad  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] was urging all parties in the region , including [LOC Israel  ] , to exercise restraint and support [MISC Lebanese  ] independence. “This is our commitment , ” [PER Miqdad  ] responded , “we shall not interfere ( in [LOC Lebanon  ] ) .” The [MISC Lebanese  ] should be allowed to decide for themselves on how to resolve their own issues ; those who would interfere want to disturb the peace after [LOC Lebanon  ] successfully conducted national elections and formed a consensus government. “We’re confident the [MISC Lebanese  ] can deal with their own situation , ” he said . 
Charge rejoined that the military capabilities of a non-state actor like [ORG Hizballah  ] represented a major concern because [ORG Hizballah  ] responded only to its own leadership and not to government authorities. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Miqdad  ] said this issue should be discussed in the overall framework of the situation . 
He then contended the provision of [LOC U.S.  ] weapons to the region represented a destabilizing factor. “The most sophisticated weapons are coming to [LOC Israel  ] , to be used against whom ? ” he asked . 
When the [LOC U.S.  ] pressed [LOC Israel  ] to stop threatening its neighbors , the situation would stabilize. “We want peace . 
It’s the only solution . 
We are the ones who are threatened , ” he declared . 
Charge replied the whole region was threatened . 
[PER Miqdad  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Syria  ] needed to worked toward peace. “You should address your message to the people who don’t want peace , ” he added , noting the results of [LOC U/S Burns’  ] visit should be preserved and continued to improve relations . 
[LOC Syria  ] had responded positively to [LOC U/S Burns’  ] message because it felt more confident of [LOC Washington’s  ] desire to move forward. --------------------- CVT and [ORG DCS  ] Follow-Up --------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Charge affirmed the [LOC U.S.  ] shared this intent and wanted to maximize the opportunity by staying in close contact . 
In that context , he raised [MISC PRM’s  ] pending request to [PER Miqdad  ] to assist the [ORG Center for the Victims of Torture  ] to receive approval to begin a proposed project in [LOC Syria  ] ; [PER Miqdad  ] agreed to look at the matter and requested [MISC Embassy  ] follow-up . 
Likewise , on the issue of visas for the next group of [ORG DHS  ] circuit riders , [PER Miqdad  ] asked that the circuit riders not apply for visas until he had had a chance to intervene . 
( [PER Note: Embassy  ] will provide [PER Miqdad  ] with a list of the circuit riders . 
) <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Charge also asked [PER Miqdad  ] for advice on how to proceed regarding [ORG Damascus Community School  ] ( [ORG DCS  ] ) . 
FM Muallim had instructed the [MISC Embassy  ] to “start hiring teachers , ” but the [ORG MFA  ] had not yet provided any written notification of President Asad’s decision to allow the school to re-open . 
There also remained the issue of whether [MISC Syrian  ] students would be allowed to enroll . 
[PER Miqdad  ] agreed that this matter required a response and advised the Charge to follow up with him in the coming week . 
( [PER Note: Miqdad  ] reported he would be traveling to [LOC Libya  ] for two days to discuss bilateral relations . 
) ------- Comment ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In the midst of hosting a quick-notice visit by [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Ahmedinejad  ] ( who openly criticized the Secretary’s [ORG Congressional  ] testimony expressing concern about [LOC Syria  ] and [ORG Hizballah  ] ) , the SARG might interpret our demarche as an attempt to divert the spotlight from the show of mutual support between [LOC Tehran  ] and [LOC Damascus  ] . 
Miqdad’s surprise that we would raise this issue so forcefully on the heels of [LOC U/S Burns’  ] visit may have been genuine , but the abject denial of any [MISC Syrian  ] role in supplying arms to [ORG Hizballah  ] and the verbal counter-attack against [MISC Israeli  ] provocation were standard ( if disingenuous ) responses . 
Yet even a seasoned diplomat like [PER Miqdad  ] could not restrain a raised eyebrow at our mention of the transfer of ballistic missiles to [ORG Hizballah  ] . 
We expect the specificity of this concern could well prompt further discussions among [MISC Syrian  ] officials , [ORG Hizballah  ] , and the visiting [MISC Iranian  ] delegation. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Miqdad  ] notably did not respond to our concern about a possible [ORG Hizballah  ] revenge operation for the assassination of [PER Imad Mughniyeh  ] . 
While [PER Miqdad  ] and [MISC Syrian  ] officials might take some comfort in UNIFIL’s role in preventing the spillover of recent tensions in south [LOC Lebanon  ] , a [ORG Hizballah  ] operation against [MISC Israeli  ] targets could easily result in a situation in which [ORG UNIFIL  ] found itself unable to contain rising escalation . 
One point we might stress in the future: Syria’s desire for a deterrent against [MISC Israeli  ] military action -- presumably a motivation for the transfer of ballistic missiles to [ORG Hizballah  ] -- will not increase stability because there are no mechanisms or rules of the road to prevent and/or manage unanticipated escalation . 
Not having control over Hizballah’s missiles or influence over Hizballah’s military plans to avenge [PER Mughniyeh  ] increases this danger . 
Our demarche might resonate more fully here if we can persuade other key countries , such as [LOC Turkey  ] , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , [LOC Qatar  ] , [LOC Jordan  ] , [LOC France  ] , and others , to underscore their concerns about regional instability , to which Syria’s supply of ballistic missiles to [ORG Hizballah  ] is directly contributing. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Leaving aside the substance of Miqdad’s response to the demarche , his agreement to meet us on two hours’ notice on a [MISC Syrian  ] holiday ( the Prophet’s birthday ) and during the [PER Ahmedinejad  ] visit is worth noting . 
Miqdad’s Chief of Staff is typically the recipient of [MISC Embassy  ] demarches ; CDA’s only other meeting with [PER Miqdad  ] apart from appointments involving [LOC Washington  ] visitors was to discuss the Vice Minister’s trip to the [LOC U.S.  ] last September . 
His future willingness to meet directly with us -- which FM Muallim instructed him to do to follow up on [ORG DCS  ] issues -- will serve as one more barometer of the SARG commitment to engagement in the weeks and months ahead .
