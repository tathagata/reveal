( [ORG U  ] ) The [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Embassy  ] continues to receive reports from official visitors and tourists of recent VARIG domestic and international flight cancellations due to the airline 's financial difficulties . 
These cancellations continue to result in missed connecting flights in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] and [LOC Rio  ] , and disruption of travelers' itineraries . 
Although the airline has been purchased by a new buyer , both domestic and international flights are likely to operate at a significantly reduced confidence level during their restructuring period . 
[LOC U.S.  ] citizens should keep this in mind when making travel plans. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) All official visitors must attend the [ORG RSO Security  ] briefing. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 .

Persons entering [LOC Brazil  ] under the [ORG USG  ] auspices have an important role to play in strengthening [LOC U.S.  ] - [LOC Brazil  ] cooperation . 
Please keep this priority in mind during your visit and inform the embassy or nearest consulate promptly of any opportunities or problems that arise . 
As a result of the imposition of biometric enrolment of the [MISC US-VISIT  ] program , the Government of [LOC Brazil  ] started fingerprinting and photographing arriving [LOC U.S.  ] citizens in January 2004 . 
Present GOB policy is not to fingerprint [LOC U.S.  ] travelers arriving on official or diplomatic visas . 
It is possible , however , that official visitors could be asked to submit to a fingerprinting through administrative error . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] hopes that visitors will comply with reasonable requests from the [MISC Brazilian  ] immigration authorities . 
Any unusual delays or unreasonable treatment should be brought to the attention of the Management Officer so they can be relayed to the GOB . 
Full cooperation with the identification procedures is advisable. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 .

Therefore , all [ORG USG  ] contractors ( regardless of the government agency they are contracted to ) must provide their control officer prior to arrival the name , phone number , and policy number of their medevac insurance provider ( s ) for use in case of emergency . 
Contractors do not have access to services in the [MISC Health Units at Post  ] .

The agency should provide post with a written communication generated by the traveler 's headquarters that confirms the agency will pay [ORG ICASS  ] charges for the [ORG TDYer  ] .

Some of the more important tips that you should follow to avoid becoming a crime victim are: -- Do not carry or wear valuable items that will attract the attention of thieves . 
If you need to wear expensive jewelry or carry a camera ; conceal it until you arrive at your destination . 
[LOC BRASILIA  ] 00002094 003 OF 003 -- Be aware of the street environment and avoid contact with those who may be looking for robbery targets . 
Seek a safer location . 
Go into a store , bank or simply cross the street . 
-- Do not physically resist any robbery attempt .

-- Do not answer your hotel room door until you positively confirm who is on the other side . 
Look out the peephole , or call the front desk to confirm the visitor . 
-- Do not walk on the beaches after dark . 
Assaults are common .

Many pass through high crime areas and are susceptible to robberies .
