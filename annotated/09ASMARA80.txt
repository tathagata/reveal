REF: ADDIS ABABA 567 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Ronald K. McMullen  ] for reason 1.4 ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) Summary: [PER Young Eritreans  ] are fleeing their country in droves , the economy appears to be in a death spiral , [LOC Eritrea’s  ] prisons are overflowing , and the country’s unhinged dictator remains cruel and defiant . 
Is the country “on the brink of disaster” as posited by [LOC Eritrea’s  ] first cousins across the border in [LOC Tigray  ] , [LOC Ethiopia  ] ( ref ) ? 
Party leaders tell us their Leninist “war economy” will be reversed , while [ORG Asmara  ] is abuzz with reports of multiple cabinet-level changes . 
However , tinkering at the margins of governance will count for naught as long as the [PER Isaias  ] regime remains a one-man band . 
Gold mining will not provide the anticipated economic panacea . 
Although the regime is one bullet away from implosion , [LOC Eritrea’s  ] resilience as a country is based on 1 ) a strong sense of nationalism forged over four decades of war , and 2 ) the capacity of most [MISC Eritreans  ] to withstand suffering and deprivation with forbearance and toughness . 
Any sudden change in government is likely to be initiated from within the military . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) The [ORG Regime’s Political Capital  ] is Tanking --------------------------------------------- --- [MISC Isaias’  ] popularity stemmed from his leading role in [LOC Eritrea’s Davidic  ] victory in the thirty-year struggle for independence . 
Immediately after liberation , [PER Isaias  ] seemed to be providing ( like [PER Mugabe  ] ) reasonably good governance to his traumatized nation . 
The accelerating decline into dictatorship began in 1996 with an alleged assassination attempt against [PER Isaias  ] by [MISC Ethiopian  ] PM [PER Meles Zenawi  ] , followed by the bloody 1998-2000 Border War , and the “treason” of the inner-circle critics called the [MISC G-15  ] . 
Severe persecution of any potential opposition increased . 
With half of [LOC Eritrea’s  ] population being born after liberation , [PER Isaias’ Struggle  ] credentials are less important than before ; youth today face a hopeless future of open-ended [ORG National Service  ] at survival-level wages . 
[PER Hope  ] for a better future fueled [MISC Eritrean  ] resistance for a whole generation ; the country’s reservoir of hope is now largely depleted. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) The War Economy is Failing --------------------------------- [PER Hagos Ghebrehiwet  ] , as the Economic Director of the [ORG Peoples Front for Democracy and Justice  ] ( [ORG PFDJ  ] ) , is the architect of the regime’s failed economic policies . 
When previously asked by the ambassador if he was a [MISC Communist  ] , [PER Hagos  ] replied , “No . 
Quite the opposite.” He explained that from 1993-98 development of the tiny private sector was a top goal , but with the outbreak of war in 1998 “national security became the economic and political imperative.” He contends that the subsequent “no peace , no war” situation with [LOC Ethiopia  ] obligated the state to maintain the economy on a war footing , due to shortages of hard currency . 
[PER Hagos  ] told the ambassador in mid-February that the regime was reversing its war economy policies. “We are going back to the immediate post-independence approach , ” he claimed . 
[ORG NOTE: Post  ] has seen no indication of this . 
END NOTE. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Gold To the Rescue ? 
No ------------------------------ Many [MISC Eritrean  ] businessmen and officials hope , and opposition members fear , that come 2010 , gold mining will provide the economic fillip needed to rescue the economy and the regime . 
Mining company executives tell us these hopes and fears are grossly misplaced . 
Nevsun is the [MISC Canadian  ] company leading the development of the large [LOC Bisha  ] gold , copper , and zinc field . 
Nevsun employees say [LOC Bisha  ] is like [MISC Neapolitan  ] ice cream , with a thin layer of gold atop thicker layers of copper and zinc . 
Nevsun’s agreement is heavily front-loaded for cost recovery , meaning for the first two years ( the life of the gold extraction ) almost all revenues will accrue to Nevsun for capital and infrastructure costs . 
The gold will be flown from [LOC Bisha  ] directly to [LOC Switzerland  ] . 
While the government will get some revenues from taxes and royalties , it is only with the beginning of copper extraction in 2012 or 2013 and zinc five years later that the government of [LOC Eritrea  ] will see much return on its investment . 
In short , there is no help on the immediate horizon for [LOC Eritrea’s  ] faltering economy. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) No [MISC American Enemy  ] to Blame --------------------------------- Prior to January 20 every bad thing in [LOC Eritrea  ] was touted as proof of an [MISC American-led  ] conspiracy against [LOC Eritrea  ] . 
Daily anti-American diatribes peppered the regime-controlled airwaves and print media . 
The regime attempted to deflect all complaints by claiming [LOC America  ] and its puppet , [LOC Ethiopia  ] , were an immediate threat to [LOC Eritrea’s  ] sovereignty and/or territorial integrity . 
Criticism of the regime was thus tantamount not only to sedition , but also to treason . 
Since January 20 the regime has been on what it considers a charm offensive with the [LOC U.S.  ] in hopes that the [PER Obama  ] administration will for some reason reverse USG opposition to the regime’s regional meddling and domestic oppression . 
Without the “world’s sole superpower” being constantly blamed for all of [LOC Eritrea’s  ] woes , [MISC Eritreans  ] seem to be focusing more on their own government’s manifest shortcomings . 
Grumblings are increasingly loud and frequent , but still only in private. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Tough , Proud , and Suffering ---------------------------------- Around 80% of [MISC Eritreans  ] live on farms or in small villages . 
Many are only marginally involved in the monetized economy and produce part of what their families need to survive . 
Governmental benign neglect would be a positive and welcome change . 
The regime’s practice of seizing crops or forcing farmers to sell grain at below-market prices has caused families to attempt to withdraw from the monetized economy , at least in part , although the [PER Isaias  ] regime is very good at controlling nearly all aspects of [MISC Eritrean  ] society . 
[MISC Eritrean  ] farmers have long lived a knife-edge existence due to marginal rainfall , decades of war and brigandage , and the use of [MISC Dark Age  ] technology . 
Even before last year’s dreadful harvest , [ORG UNICEF  ] reckoned that 40% of [MISC Eritrean  ] children were malnourished . 
Despite this , [MISC Eritreans  ] remain fiercely patriotic . 
In the face of deprivation and oppression , the time-tested best practice is to shut up , hunker down , and pray for rain. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) Where Will [MISC Change Come From  ] ? ------------------------------------ In hushed tones , Asmarinos are discussing reports of wholesale changes in the cabinet and other senior civilian positions . 
From what we understand , the exercise ( septel ) will be a grand round of musical chairs , with former fighters loyal to President [PER Isaias  ] mostly swapping ministerial portfolios . 
Meanwhile , the urban population remains largely cowed . 
The PFDJ’s Secretary General languishes in medical exile in [LOC UAE  ] ; [PER Isaias  ] chairs the party’s monthly meetings in his absence . 
Neither the government , party , nor populace seem to have the wherewithal to effect a sudden change in government . 
The military does . 
We’ve heard increasingly frequent and specific reports of mutinous behavior from within the military , sparked by growing numbers of troops deserting across the border into [LOC Sudan  ] and even into [LOC Ethiopia  ] . 
The mantle of [MISC Eritrean  ] nationalism could conceivably pass from the shoulders of [PER Isaias Afwerki  ] to the [MISC Eritrean  ] [ORG Defense Force  ] . 
Defense Minister [PER Sebhat Efrem  ] probably has the standing to paper over the rivalries of the senior generals ( at least temporarily ) , should the military or a faction of it suddenly find the need to step in to “save the revolution.” [MISC MCMULLEN</pre></code>  ]
