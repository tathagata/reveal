[LOC AMMAN  ] 4559 <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
[LOC AMMAN  ] 4676 Classified By: Ambassador [PER David Hale  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) In the wake of November 20 parliamentary elections , Prime Minister [PER Marouf Bakhit  ] submitted his resignation to the King November 22 , paving the way for a new government . 
On November 23 , the King designated [PER Nader Dahabi  ] as the new Prime Minister , and the new cabinet was sworn in on November <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
Bios of [PER Dahabi  ] and his cabinet follow . 
[PER Nader Dahabi  ] Prime Minister --------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( SBU/NF ) An [LOC East Banker  ] , [PER Dahabi  ] was born October 7 1946 in [LOC Amman  ] . 
[PER Dahabi  ] holds a BSc from the [MISC Greek  ] [ORG Air Force Academy  ] , along with a Masters degrees in [ORG Public Administration  ] from [ORG Auburn University  ] and a degree in [LOC Aeronautical Engineering  ] from [ORG Cranfield Institute of Technology  ] in the [LOC United Kingdom  ] . 
A career air force officer , [PER Dahabi  ] became President and CEO of government-owned [ORG Royal Jordanian Airlines  ] upon his retirement from the military , a post which he held from 1994 to 2001 . 
He then served a short stint as Minister of Transport from 2001 to 2002 . 
After his ministerial tenure , [PER Dahabi  ] took up the chairmanship of the [ORG Aqaba Special Economic Zone  ] ( [ORG ASEZA  ] ) in 2004. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The choice of [PER Dahabi  ] as Prime Minister represents the palace 's desire to fill the position with an [LOC East Banker  ] whose tribal and military background comforts the monarchy 's loyal base , but whose career demonstrates the ability to effectively implement a reform agenda . 
It also represents the hope for smooth intra-governmental relations . 
[PER Dahabi  ] 's brother [PER Mohamad  ] is the head of the powerful General Intelligence Directorate ( [ORG GID  ] ) , and it is expected that the relationship between the royal court , the [ORG GID  ] , and the government will be smoother under this government than previous ones . 
Critics will likely claim that the familial connection in these two critical posts is a fundamental conflict of interest , but this argument neglects the new PM 's standing as a strong and successful public figure in his own right. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) During his tenure as [ORG ASEZA  ] Commissioner , [PER Dahabi  ] worked extensively with [LOC USAID  ] on local development projects . 
He is seen in the development community as an extremely effective technocrat who knows how to get things done . 
He is well-connected in the private sector , and in [LOC Aqaba  ] succeeded in attracting investment from many international firms . 
Some have described [PER Dahabi  ] as essentially a " small Prime Minister " in [LOC Aqaba  ] , where he had extensive exposure to the bread-and-butter economic issues that drove the parliamentary campaigns and drive the king 's reform agenda ( Ref A ) . 
He understands the relationship between poverty , unemployment , and youth issues in particular . 
He has also worked on the hot button issue of foreign laborers. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Dahabi  ] is known as an operator who concentrates on top-down change rather than consultative reform from the grass roots . 
He was criticized as disconnected from local community organizations during his tenure in [LOC Aqaba  ] , and retained cool working relationships with [ORG NGOs  ] until appointing a competent liaison to handle that portion of his portfolio . 
He is known as a blunt person who , rather than hiding behind a public persona , sets clear goals and expects partners and subordinates to follow through . 
He sets clear guidelines for action when they are necessary. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The new PM is expected to focus on domestic development issues and fiscal reform , and not meddle in foreign relations , as indicated in the King 's designation letter . 
He will likely face a challenge in dealing with the new parliament . 
The new lower house comes out of a competitive campaign season and is eager to show activity , but the direction of that energy is far from certain ; the previous parliament proved effective at blocking or slowing key pieces of economic reform legislation . 
[PER Dahabi  ] will have to corral a multitude of independent ( and often conflicting ) interests in order to effectively implement the extensive reform agenda envisioned by the King . 
Given long-term relationships with [LOC USAID  ] , contractors , and the development community , [PER Dahabi  ] sees the [MISC U.S.-Jordan  ] partnership as positive and productive . 
Since he understands the international workings of aid and investment , he is likely to seek detailed and feasible solutions to [LOC Jordan  ] 's needs internationally. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) [PER Dahabi  ] is married , with two sons and one daughter . 
He speaks [MISC English  ] and [MISC Greek  ] . 
[LOC AMMAN  ] 00004693 002 OF 007 Salah [PER Bashir  ] Foreign Minister ---------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( SBU/NF ) Born in 1966 , [PER Bashir  ] is considered to be an [LOC East Banker  ] , though his mother is of [MISC Palestinian  ] origin . 
[PER Bashir  ] 's father was Minister of Health when he died in the 1977 helicopter crash that also killed Queen [PER Alia  ] , King [PER Hussein  ] 's third wife . 
His mother is [PER Haifa Bashir  ] , a long time civil society activist who is currently president of the [ORG White Beds Society  ] , a charity that assists [MISC Jordanians  ] who are elderly and poor . 
[PER Bashir  ] obtained his [ORG BA  ] in Law from the [ORG University of Jordan  ] in 1987 , an [LOC MA  ] in Law from [ORG Harvard Law School  ] , and a PhD in [ORG Civil Law  ] from [ORG McGill University  ] in 1996 .

In 1997 , he also became a managing partner at [ORG Abu Ghazaleh Legal Services  ] , serving as a legal advisor on international affairs . 
[PER Bashir  ] was appointed as a member of the King 's [ORG Economic Consultative Council  ] in 1999 . 
[PER Bashir  ] was appointed as Minister of Trade and Industry in 2001 . 
He held that post ( surviving a cabinet re-shuffle ) until 2003 , when he became Minister of [ORG Justice  ] , while at the same time holding the title of Minister of State for Prime [ORG Ministry Affairs  ] . 
After another cabinet shuffle in 2005 , he briefly held the position of Minister of [ORG Government Performance  ] . 
Since the appointment of the [LOC Bakhit  ] government in November 2005 , [PER Bashir  ] has been in private legal practice. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( SBU ) His expertise in international law mostly extends to trade and economic issues . 
He is considered an expert on [ORG WTO  ] law and international trade , having prepared a study of investment-related licensing procedures in [LOC Jordan  ] and assisted in drafting recommendations for procedural reforms. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) As [ORG Justice  ] Minister , [PER Bashir  ] was an active partner in implementing a [LOC USAID  ] judicial reform program , but suffered from a strong backlash because of his refusal to make judicial appointments and other personnel choices based on tribal and political favoritism . 
In one famous episode , he was assaulted by the father of a jilted office seeker and had to restrain his own tribe from seeking revenge . 
He was also accused during his time as [ORG Justice  ] Minister of a conflict of interest between his role on [LOC Jordan  ] 's [ORG WTO  ] accession negotiation team and his private sector job as a lawyer . 
At the time , politically-motivated rumors circulated that [PER Bashir  ] was ordering up policies that would benefit his firm . 
In response to this , [PER Bashir  ] turned over his stake in the firm to his wife , and recused himself from any negotiations that would have furthered the conflict of interest claims. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Bashir  ] is trusted by the King and is a close confidant of the new Chief of the [ORG Royal Court Bassem Adwallah  ] ( former office director for the King ) . 
He has no foreign policy experience per se , but is intelligent and observant . 
He is also in step with the King 's strategy and [LOC Jordan  ] 's relationship with the [LOC United States  ] . 
The appointment of a new Foreign Minister ends what had become a dysfunctional relationship between the royal court and the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] , in which the latter was frequently excluded from policy discussions. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 .
