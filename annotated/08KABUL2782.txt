[LOC KABUL  ] 2746 [PER B. RIYADH  ] 1510 Classified By: Ambassador [PER William B. Wood  ] for Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY . 
On October 13 , [PER Abdul Qayum  ] Karzai described to the Ambassador the potential [MISC Saudi  ] reconciliation process . 
He and [PER Abdullah Anas  ] developed the current initiative a year ago and secured [MISC Taliban  ] engagement through Anas’ connection to [PER Mullah Abdul Salam Zaif  ] ( former [MISC Taliban  ] Ambassador to [LOC Pakistan  ] ) . 
He led a recent [MISC Afghan  ] delegation of 17 , including former [MISC Taliban  ] officials , to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] for an informal meeting of mullahs and an iftar dinner with the King . 
[PER Qayum  ] expressed concern about the fragility of the process and its vulnerability to being “usurped” by the government . 
[LOC Saudi Arabia  ] agreed to continue facilitating talks , but was firm it would not serve as an intermediary for the [MISC Taliban  ] - they must work directly with [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Qayum  ] said the King is concerned about being too closely linked to the [MISC Taliban  ] and that media speculation regarding the recent [MISC Saudi-hosted  ] event made some officials there nervous . 
[PER Qayum  ] assured the Ambassador the [LOC U.S.  ] would be consulted at every step and asked that the [LOC U.S.  ] urge the [MISC Saudis  ] to remain engaged . 
( [PER Qayum  ] is President Karzai’s brother and an [MISC American  ] citizen . 
) <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) For the past two and a half years , [PER Qayum  ] said he had been seeking a “bottom-up” process for engagement with reconciliable [MISC Taliban  ] outside a governmental framework . 
Although many senior [MISC Taliban  ] were interested in ending hostilities , individual reconciliation was not an option for them politically . 
In October 2007 , [PER Qayum  ] met with [PER Abdullah Anas  ] ( former [MISC Algerian  ] mujahideen commander now living in [LOC London  ] ) to discuss Anas’ proposal of engaging [MISC Muslim  ] clerics and scholars to create a framework for talks with the [MISC Taliban  ] . 
[PER Qayum  ] suggested [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] or [LOC Dubai  ] . 
[PER Anas  ] agreed and began to consul prominent [MISC Muslim  ] scholars , rallying them around their shared concern that [MISC Taliban  ] violence gave [PER Islam  ] “a bad name” throughout the world . 
SEEKING [MISC SAUDI  ] INVOLVEMENT <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Anas  ] and [PER Qayum  ] met with [PER Dr. Mansour  ] , advisor to King [PER Abdullah  ] , to ask [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] to host the first engagement in this process: gathering a “group of mullahs.” [PER Mansour  ] reacted positively to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] serving this role , in part because as it would dilute [MISC Saudi  ] Arabia’s identification with [LOC Pakistan  ] - and extremism . 
According to [PER Qayum  ] , [PER Mansour  ] stated “the international community sees us as a front.” [PER Qayum  ] noted that the [MISC Saudis  ] see a directly link between Afghanistan’s security and their own stability concerns . 
[MISC TALIBAN  ] MULLAH [PER ZAIF  ] AGREES TO PARTICIPATE <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In April 2008 , [PER Qayum  ] hosted [PER Dr. Mansour  ] , [PER Anas  ] and [PER Mullah Abdul  ] [PER Salam Zaif  ] , former [MISC Taliban  ] ambassador to [LOC Pakistan  ] and informal line to [PER Mullah Omar  ] , at his home in [LOC Kandahar  ] . 
[PER Qayum  ] said that when his guests arrived the television was showing footage of a [MISC Taliban  ] bombing attack on a mosque earlier that day . 
The men were visibly upset by the carnage , including [PER Zaif  ] . 
The shared reaction to the bombing set the tone for constructive talks and [PER Zaif  ] agreed to participate . 
[PER Qayum  ] shared his view that [PER Zaif  ] is trying to carve a political space within the [MISC Taliban  ] for reconciliation . 
[PER QAYUM  ] PREPARES THE GROUND AND THE [MISC SAUDIS  ] ENGAGE - CAUTIOUSLY <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) As a result of [MISC Qayum’s  ] , and then President Karzai’s , meetings with Dr. [PER Mansour  ] , King [PER Abdullah  ] called [PER Karzai  ] directly to discuss the proposed process . 
( The [MISC King’s  ] role energized Karzai’s interest in the process for the first time . 
) Over the next few months [PER Qayum  ] hosted a number of [MISC Taliban  ] representatives in [LOC Kandahar  ] to continue preparations. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Through the spring and summer representatives from both [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] shuttled back and forth . 
[PER Qayum  ] and former [LOC Kandahar  ] Governor [PER Asadullah Khalid  ] worked [LOC KABUL  ] 00002782 002 OF 003 closely together , traveling to [MISC Saudi  ] to meet with [PER Mansour  ] and Prince [PER Miqrin  ] , head of [MISC Saudi  ] intelligence . 
[PER Mansour  ] made more visits to [LOC Kabul  ] and [PER Anas  ] continued to serve as go-between with [PER Zaif  ] and [ORG Taliban  ] . 
In August , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] agreed to host an initial contact meeting during [MISC Ramadan  ] -- stressing the importance of maintaining a low profile . 
While indicating the King Abdullah’s desire to assist , [PER Miqrin  ] made it clear the King was approaching the process cautiously and did not want to be linked too closely to the [ORG Taliban  ] . 
[PER Miqrin  ] said [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] didn’t want “to be alone in this , ” highlighting the importance of keeping the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC U.K.  ] informed . 
[PER Miqrin  ] also stressed the [MISC Taliban  ] leadership should not see [MISC Saudi  ] Arabia’s willingness to support the talks as an indication the country would serve as an intermediary ; the [MISC Taliban  ] must pursue the reconciliation process directly with [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
THE SEPTEMBER MEETING <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) In organizing the trip , [PER Qayum  ] , [PER Mansour  ] and [PER Zaif  ] agreed the focus would be on religious activities and peaceful exchanges , in keeping with the [MISC Ramadan  ] season . 
Both sides agreed a large group would not be advisable so there were 17 in the [MISC Afghan  ] delegation , and only a subset would attend all meetings . 
In addition to [PER Zaif  ] , [PER Maulavi Ahmad Mutawakkil  ] ( [MISC Taliban  ] ex-Foreign Minister ) , [PER Maulvi Abdul Hadi Shinwari  ] ( former chief justice ) and current [MISC Afghan  ] senator [PER Arsala Rahmani  ] agreed to attend . 
[PER Qayum  ] denied reports that [PER Hekmatyar  ] sent a representative ; he said Hekmatyar’s nephew was in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] at the same time , but did not participate in the talks. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Qayum  ] said the [MISC Saudis  ] orchestrated the encounter carefully . 
When the [ORG Taliban  ] group arrived , [PER Qayum  ] went to his room while [PER Mansour  ] remained with the group to welcome them . 
[PER Mansour  ] , like [PER Miqrin  ] , made opening points to the [LOC Taliban:  ] [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] condemned the killing of innocents in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and viewed the [MISC Afghan  ] constitution with the same respect as its own ; both share a common basis in the [MISC Koran  ] . 
The [MISC Saudis  ] further clarified they would not support any [ORG Taliban  ] proposals that infringed on the authority of the central [MISC Afghan  ] government - such as the establishment of autonomous regions. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Qayum  ] said Prince [PER Miqrin  ] called him just before dawn to brief him on the dinner and meeting . 
[PER Miqrin  ] said a large group had come from [LOC Medina  ] to meet the [MISC Afghan  ] delegation and there had been an enthusiastic response from the [LOC Quetta  ] participants . 
[PER Qayum  ] said everyone reacted nervously when details of the process first leaked to the media - especially the [ORG Taliban  ] participants and the [MISC Saudis  ] . 
[PER Miqrin  ] suggested an alternative location might be needed for talks - perhaps [LOC Dubai  ] . 
[PER QAYUM  ] DETERMINED TO KEEP PROCESS DISCIPLINED AND OUT OF GOVT HANDS <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The Ambassador praised [MISC Qayum’s  ] leadership on this important issue . 
He stressed that such talks require discipline and patience . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] must deal from a position of strength . 
[PER Qayum  ] agreed , saying that if the military pressure on the [ORG Taliban  ] eased the process would fail . 
He confided what he had told Dr. [PER Mansour  ] - that the engagement must be kept simple and focused at the beginning - with the same facilitators guiding it until it matured . 
It would collapse if too many people - or governments - became involved . 
[PER Qayum  ] repeatedly expressed concern that the government might “usurp” the process: “An [MISC Afghan  ] government-based negotiation would lead to everyone at the table demanding a slice ( of the government ) , but the government would be unable to satisfy all of these competing demands and would take the blame for the negotiations’ failure.” <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The Ambassador asked that the [LOC U.S.  ] be advised if [LOC Afghanistan  ] engaged any [ORG Taliban  ] with ties to [ORG Al Qaeda  ] and/or global terrorism in the reconciliation process - figures like [PER Mullah Omar  ] and [PER Mullah Barader  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] did not oppose this [LOC KABUL  ] 00002782 003 OF 003 process , stressed the Ambassador , but would not be a participant either . 
[PER Qayum  ] accepted this and commented that he saw no way for [PER Mullah Omar  ] to survive the process - he didn’t have the intelligence or popular support to emerge on top . 
He and [PER Barader  ] were hated by too many elements within the [MISC Pashtun  ] spectrum . 
Perhaps exile was an option for them . 
In closing , [PER Qayum  ] assured the Ambassador that the [LOC U.S.  ] would be kept informed of all developments . 
COMMENT <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Qayum  ] has President Karzai’s confidence , but is a neophyte in such a process . 
The encounter in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] was with [MISC Afghan  ] and [ORG Taliban  ] proxies , rather than decision-makers . 
It is especially unclear what connection [PER Zaif  ] and the other so-called [ORG Taliban  ] representatives have with the [ORG Taliban  ] leadership , although there are reports that [PER Zaif  ] met with two representatives from the [LOC Quetta  ] [MISC Shura  ] who had shadowed the delegation to follow developments and report back . 
President [PER Karzai  ] is interested in this process at least as much because it represents a step forward in support from King [PER Abdullah  ] as because it holds some prospect for neutralizing some or all of the [ORG Taliban  ] . 
That said , this encounter could bring [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] closer to [LOC Afghanistan  ] and could have some benefits with the [ORG Taliban  ] , especially if other pressures on the [ORG Taliban  ] continue to grow . 
We intend to be supportive , but without unrealistic expectations , and certainly with no direct [LOC U.S.  ] involvement .
