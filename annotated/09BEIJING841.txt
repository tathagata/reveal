End Summary . 
[MISC CHINESE  ] INTEREST IN [LOC COLOMBIA  ] , [ORG POTENTIAL HAIER INVESTMENT  ] ----------------------- --------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Chinese  ] interest in [LOC Colombia  ] has picked up substantially since [LOC China  ] 's November 2008 publication of a white paper outlining an updated policy on [LOC Latin America  ] , [MISC Colombian  ] Commercial Attache [PER Alejandro Ossa  ] told [ORG EmbOff  ] on March 18 . 
[MISC Chinese  ] companies that previously were not interested in the [MISC Colombian  ] market are now showing very active interest as if responding to a clear directive , he said , citing [ORG Haier  ] as an example . 
After [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Hugo Chavez  ] visited [LOC China  ] in 2006 , [ORG Haier  ] and other [MISC Chinese  ] companies like [ORG Huawei  ] were instructed by the [MISC Chinese  ] government to invest in [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
Contacts at [ORG Haier  ] had told the [MISC Colombian  ] Attache that they had been reluctant to invest in [LOC Venezuela  ] and therefore dragged their feet . 
However , they are now in discussions about investing in [LOC Colombia  ] instead . 
[ORG Haier  ] considers [LOC Colombia  ] to be more stable than [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
Because its economic policies are " more open " than [LOC Venezuela  ] 's , they believe [LOC Colombia  ] to be a better base for targeting the rest of [LOC Latin America  ] . 
A [ORG Haier  ] delegation accompanied [MISC Chinese  ] Vice President [PER Xi Jinping  ] to [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Colombia  ] on his February 2009 visit to [LOC Latin America  ] . 
[MISC COLOMBIAN  ] FRUSTRATION WITH [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG FTA  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Ossa  ] said that [MISC Chinese  ] interest in [LOC Latin America  ] is driven primarily by a desire to expand [LOC China  ] 's influence . 
It is clear that the [MISC Chinese  ] are willing to enter into deals without strong economic benefits . 
Unlike the [LOC United States  ] , [LOC Beijing  ] makes no demands , he said . 
[LOC Colombia  ] is looking for additional economic partners , particularly as there is resentment over the fact that the [MISC U.S.-Colombian  ] [ORG FTA  ] has still not been approved by [ORG Congress  ] . 
[PER Ossa  ] added that [LOC Colombia  ] resents that human rights issues have been a major impediment to the [MISC U.S.-Colombia  ] [ORG FTA  ] , while many believed human rights were largely ignored during Secretary [PER Clinton  ] 's February visit to [LOC China  ] . 
[LOC COLOMBIA  ] NOT INTERESTED IN [ORG FTA  ] , [ORG ONLY INVESTMENT  ] ------------------- ---------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Unlike [LOC Chile  ] , [LOC Colombia  ] is not interested in an [ORG FTA  ] with [LOC China  ] because [MISC Sino-Colombian  ] trade is not complementary . 
On the contrary , [LOC BEIJING  ] 00000841 002 OF 002 the two countries' products compete . 
[PER Ossa  ] says that [LOC Colombia  ] is not willing to be " walked all over " by [LOC China  ] " like [LOC Africa  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
" [PER Ossa  ] admitted that [MISC Colombian  ] attempts to increase some product exports , in particular fruit , have been unsuccessful due to the undeveloped nature of [MISC Colombian  ] food and safety regulatory agencies. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Colombia  ] is interested in [MISC Chinese  ] investment , [PER Ossa  ] said . 
In particular , the [MISC Colombian  ] government is interested in [MISC Chinese  ] investment in infrastructure , chemicals , automobile plants and consumer electronics . 
They are less interested in investment in mining or hydrocarbons because they are suspicious of [LOC China  ] 's environmental and labor practices , and are unwilling to make concessions on those fronts . 
( Note: [MISC Colombian  ] labor laws require companies to employ 10 [MISC Colombians  ] for every foreigner hired . 
End note . 
) [LOC COLOMBIA  ] TO HOST [LOC CHINA  ] LATIN AMERICA BUSINESS SUMMIT -------------------------- -------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) During the [ORG APEC  ] meeting in [LOC Peru  ] last year , President [PER Uribe  ] and President [PER Hu  ] discussed the possibility of [LOC Colombia  ] hosting the third [MISC China-Latin America Entrepreneurs Summit  ] . 
It was officially announced in February 2009 that the summit will be held in [LOC Bogota  ] in November <a id='par2009' href='#par2009'>¶</a>2009 . 
[PER Ossa  ] noted that this was another signal of how interested [LOC Colombia  ] is in beefing up its economic relations with [LOC China  ] .
