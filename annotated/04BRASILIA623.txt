REASONS: 1.5 ( B ) ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's senior security and intelligence official , [ORG Institutional Security Minister  ] [PER Jorge Felix  ] , told visiting CJCS [PER Myers  ] on 10 March in [LOC Brasilia  ] that narcotrafficking poses a grave threat to [MISC Brazilian  ] national security . 
The threat is manifest in international arms-for-drugs trafficking involving [MISC Brazilian  ] organized crime gangs , in the spread of corruption in [MISC Brazilian  ] institutions , and in widespread violence against the public . 
[PER Felix  ] expressed concern that narcotraffickers might place innocent civilians on their aircraft , for use as human shields against lethal force interdictions , and said such issues made the decision to implement the shootdown law a difficult one that the President must make . 
Nonetheless , he reiterated the position that the [ORG GOB  ] considers narcotrafficking to be a threat to national security . 
On terrorism , [PER Felix  ] said [MISC Brazilian  ] authorities have found " no evidence " of operational terrorist activities in [LOC Brazil  ] , but said that the potential " bears watching . 
" End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) CJCS General [PER Richard Myers  ] , accompanied by Charge , [PER ORA Chief  ] , DATT and JCS staff met with Minister [PER Felix  ] and senior officials of the [ORG Institutional Security Cabinet  ] ( [MISC Portuguese  ] acronym [ORG GSI  ] ) at the [LOC Planalto Palace  ] ( Presidential offices ) on 10 March 2004 . 
The [ORG GSI  ] is an interagency organization within the Presidency that functions , in roughly equivalent [ORG USG  ] terms , as a combination [ORG NSC  ] , [ORG ONDCP  ] , [ORG DCI  ] and general crisis management center . 
A cabinet-level officer and general in the [MISC Brazilian  ] army , [PER Felix  ] is in charge of the [ORG GSI  ] and serves as the President 's senior security and intelligence advisor . 
SHOOTDOWN <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) General [PER Myers  ] asked Minister [PER Felix  ] whether narcotrafficking represents a grave threat to [LOC Brazil  ] 's national security . 
[PER Felix  ] responded that narcotrafficking does pose a major threat to [MISC Brazilian  ] national security on both a " wholesale " and " retail " level . 
Elaborating , [PER Felix  ] said that the " wholesale " threat is seen in the growth of international drugs for weapons trafficking between [MISC Brazilian  ] criminal organizations and [MISC Colombian  ] groups , and also in the spread of narcotics-related corruption through [MISC Brazilian  ] institutions . 
On the " retail " level , the dramatic level of hard drug use within [LOC Brazil  ] is harming the population , in terms of health and exposure to increased criminal violence. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) General [PER Myers  ] then asked [PER Felix  ] whether he was comfortable that implementing a shootdown law in [LOC Brazil  ] would be a positive development . 
[PER Felix  ] replied that he has some concerns that narcotraffickers " will not play by the same rules as we do , " and may react to shootdown measures by placing innocent women and children on narcotrafficking aircraft , for use as human shields against the use of lethal force in interdiction operations . 
Such concerns make the [ORG GOB  ] 's decision to implement a difficult one that , [PER Felix  ] said , will have to be made by President [PER Lula da Silva  ] . 
However , [PER Felix  ] reiterated the position that narcotrafficking constitutes a grave threat to [MISC Brazilian  ] national and public security . 
TERRORISM <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Turning to the issue of terrorism , [PER Felix  ] said that in the years before the September 11 attacks the [ORG GOB  ] had routinely declared that [LOC Brazil  ] was free of terrorist activities . 
Now , he said the [ORG GOB  ] 's position is that it has so far " found no evidence " of operational terrorist activities in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
He clearly stressed the concept of " evidence " -- as opposed to saying no such activity exists -- asking his interpreter to repeat this phrase with emphasis to the [ORG USG  ] interlocutors . 
The potential for increased terrorist activity in [LOC Brazil  ] " bears watching , " [PER Felix  ] added. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Felix  ] affirmed that operational cooperation between [ORG GOB  ] and [ORG USG  ] intelligence and security agencies is excellent . 
The tri-border area of [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Argentina  ] and [LOC Paraguay  ] is a " complex area " where various types of money laundering , counterfeiting and other clandestine activities overlap one another , [PER Felix  ] said . 
There is clearly potential for [MISC Islamic  ] terrorist fund-raising within this shadowy mix , [PER Felix  ] said , but the [ORG GOB  ] also must be careful to not tarnish unfairly the image of the more than eight million law-abiding [MISC Brazilians  ] of [MISC Arab  ] descent. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) General [PER Myers  ] did not have the opportunity to clear this message .
