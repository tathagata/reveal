( C ) Summary . 
Apologizing for the bank’s past excesses , senior [ORG Royal Bank of Scotland  ] executives acknowledged that ambition drove the company to overreach and pursue investments with quick returns , which landed the bank in the deep trouble it is now . 
Bailed out by the [LOC UK  ] government , which now has a 70 percent share , [ORG RBS  ] is a pursuing a multi-year plan , with annual benchmarks , to right itself and become a profitable business again . 
[ORG RBS  ] executives told visiting emboff in an April 28th meeting at the company’s headquarters in [LOC Scotland  ] that this plan would include spinning off retail and commercial activity in [LOC Asia  ] and pursuing cost savings of GBP 2.5 billion by 2011 . 
Regarding the overall economic climate , RBS’s chief risk analyst was grim and thought the signs of recovery were delusory . 
He predicted that current upheavals in the financial services sector will continue , and that a return to “narrow banking” was possible . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG RBS  ] is acknowledging and apologizing for its mistakes , said [ORG Senior Economic Advisor  ] , [PER Stephen Boyle  ] . 
Sir [PER Tom McKillop  ] , chairman , and Sir [PER Fred Goodwin  ] , former chief executive , have apologized to shareholders , the public , members of [ORG Parliament’s Treasury Select Committee  ] , especially for the bank’s ill-timed acquisition of [MISC Dutch  ] bank [ORG ABN Amro  ] , [PER Boyle  ] stated . 
Proper due diligence on the purchase was not done , and the market timing could not have been worse . 
[ORG RBS  ] executives had rigorously ( if not blindly , [PER Boyle  ] added ) pursued a vision of becoming one of the leading global banks , and this led to disastrous acquisitions. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The lesson learned is that [ORG RBS  ] must concentrate on its core businesses to recover strength and repay the [MISC British  ] taxpayer . 
The bank , [PER Boyle  ] stated , is the process of designating core and non-core businesses , and defining a one-year , three-year and five-year strategy to reach its goals . 
Among the measures will be to run down or sell outright retail and commercial activity in [LOC Asia  ] , and reduce dramatically capital intensive instruments like project finance . 
[ORG RBS  ] intends to narrow the activities of its [MISC U.S.-based  ] [ORG Citizens Financial Group  ] , which lost $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter 2008 . 
Several bank branches will be closed , and [ORG Citizens  ] , like other [ORG RBS  ] operations , will exit most activities outside its core “market footprint.” In the [LOC UK  ] , [ORG RBS  ] will limit itself to traditional retail and commercial activities , and some insurance-related work . 
It will also hold on to [LOC Ulster  ] Bank. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Another key component in re-structuring is cost reductions , with a goal of savings of GBP 2.5 billion by 2011 , said [PER Boyle  ] . 
This will be done primarily through downsizing , with an expected 9,000 job cuts just in the [LOC UK  ] alone , and thousands elsewhere in global operations . 
Staff reductions will be focused on those in IT , out-sourcing and physical plant management. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Much of the success of [LOC RBS’  ] restructuring will depend on overall economic conditions , argued [PER Peter Nathaniel  ] , senior risk analyst . 
Selling off businesses , for example , requires suitable buyers . 
However , at least for next 18 months , the global economic recovery will be weak , at best , he said . 
While there are been a few positive indicators in the past month , no one should breathe a sigh of relief . 
The level of sovereign indebtedness and the cost of government borrowing will lessen chances for a quick and sustainable turnaround , he said . 
The [LOC UK  ] government is in particular trouble , and will find itself at a disadvantage in terms of competing for capital , without a significant rise in interest rates - but that will also raise interest rates on its debt . 
He faulted HMG for being slow off the mark to address the crisis , and was particularly critical of what he said was the government’s tepid response in the fall and early winter. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Speculating about the future of banking , [PER Nathaniel  ] predicted that de facto , there will be a return to narrow banking practices . 
The number of companies with diversified financial activity will be small in number , and even those exist will have high capital reserves , either adopted voluntarily or imposed by regulators , that will reduce liquidity , As an additional effect , higher reserves will limit risk-taking and could hamstring innovation . 
He predicted that boutique banks specializing in limited and defined market niches will emerge in the wake of the crisis , while banks like [ORG RBS  ] will return to traditional banking activity . 
Comment: <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Meetings were held in [ORG RBS’ Headquarters  ] in [LOC Gogarburn  ] , a 350,000 square foot building on a 78-acre site , which opened in late 2005 . 
The building reflects the ambition of its leaders and its many vacant offices a sign of its new reality . 
While the executives were chagrined about some of [LOC RBS’  ] acquisitions , they still seemed reluctant to acknowledge there might have been other missteps . 
Former Chief Executive Sir [PER Fred Goodwin  ] has been particularly criticized for his bonus of GBP 2.8 million which he received in addition to his salary of GBP 1.3 million in 2008 . 
While RBS Chair [PER McKillop  ] has made a more broad-brush apology , [PER Goodwin  ] has only admitted that the purchase of [ORG ABN AMRO  ] was a mistake . 
In the public’s eye , [ORG RBS  ] has a lot more explaining to do .
