Please see paragraphs 2-3. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary and [ORG Action Request  ] . 
The [LOC United States  ] is developing a strategy for reaffirming both [ORG NATO  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to the core responsibility of the [MISC Alliance:  ] collective defense . 
Examining [ORG NATO  ] 's approach to contingency planning will be one element of that strategy . 
Moving from country-specific to regional contingency plans is one potential method . 
Expanding [ORG EAGLE GUARDIAN  ] could be a first step in favor of regional planning . 
[ORG USNATO  ] should engage [ORG NATO  ] Secretary General [PER Rasmussen  ] to begin to build support for expanding [ORG Eagle Guardian  ] . 
In early 2010 , the [ORG U.S. Military Representative  ] ( [ORG MILREP  ] ) at [ORG NATO  ] HQ should take the following actions: 1 ) meet jointly with the Chairman of the [ORG Military Committee  ] ( [ORG CMC  ] ) , the [MISC German  ] [ORG MILREP  ] , and other MILREPs as appropriate to urge the [ORG CMC  ] to task the Supreme Allied Commander , [LOC Europe  ] ( [ORG SACEUR  ] ) to include the [MISC Baltic  ] States in the revision of [ORG EAGLE GUARDIAN  ] , and 2 ) approach the [ORG CMC  ] and request that he task [ORG SACEUR  ] to brief the [ORG Military Committee  ] on each of [ORG NATO  ] 's contingency plans with guidance that he identify any gaps in those plans . 
We will be better positioned to consider a broader regional approach after receiving [ORG SACEUR  ] 's assessment [ORG USNATO  ] and [ORG Action Embassies  ] are asked to engage with appropriate [MISC Baltic  ] and [MISC Polish  ] officials before December 16 to outline the [LOC U.S.  ] position , while stressing the need to keep details related to [ORG NATO  ] 's military plans confidential . 
Contingency points are also provided at paragraph 4 for responding to public inquiries . 
End Summary and [ORG Action Request.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) [LOC Washington  ] shares [ORG USNATO  ] 's goal of a non-politicized process for moving forward . 
[LOC Washington  ] believes that increased public attention on the issue could complicate our efforts to achieve that goal . 
We need to make that point clearly to our [MISC Baltic  ] Allies and [LOC Poland  ] , while also underscoring that we take their request for [ORG NATO  ] contingency planning seriously and support steps to address their concerns . 
We understand [MISC Baltic  ] and [MISC Polish  ] leaders will meet on December 16 and will discuss , among other topics , [ORG NATO  ] contingency planning . 
It will be important to engage with [MISC Baltic  ] and [MISC Polish  ] officials in advance of that meeting to both outline our support for expanding [ORG EAGLE GUARDIAN  ] , and our vision for a process that can deliver a successful result . 
In discussions with [MISC Baltic  ] and [MISC Polish  ] officials , [ORG Action Posts  ] should draw upon the points below . 
( S/REL [ORG NATO  ] ) [MISC Begin Talking Points:  ] FOR [ORG RIGA  ] , [LOC TALLINN  ] , AND [LOC VILNIUS  ] -- The [LOC United States  ] has taken careful note of the repeated requests by all three [MISC Baltic  ] states for [ORG NATO  ] contingency planning for the defense of the [MISC Baltic  ] region . 
-- The [LOC United States  ] believes that [ORG NATO  ] - as a matter of course - should conduct appropriate contingency planning for the possible defense of Allied territory and populations . 
[ORG NATO  ] 's [ORG Article  ] 5 commitment requires no less . 
-- As President [PER Obama  ] said in [LOC Prague:  ] " We must work together as [ORG NATO  ] members so that we have contingency plans in place to deal with new threats , wherever they may come from . 
" -- After spending the last several months examining options on how to carry out [ORG NATO  ] contingency planning for the [MISC Baltic  ] states , the [LOC United States  ] has decided that the best course of action would be to take advantage of the ongoing revision of the existing defense of [LOC Poland  ] plan , [ORG EAGLE GUARDIAN  ] . 
[ORG EAGLE GUARDIAN  ] could be expanded to include the defense of the [MISC Baltic  ] states . 
This expansion is a logical military extension of the existing contingency plan and fits well within the scenario posited by [ORG EAGLE GUARDIAN  ] . 
-- We would also like to make clear that we see the expansion of [ORG EAGLE GUARDIAN  ] as a step toward the possible expansion of [ORG NATO  ] 's other existing country-specific contingency plans into regional plans . 
This is the first step in a multi- stage process to develop a complete set of appropriate contingency plans for the full range of possible threats -- both regional and functional -- as soon as possible . 
At the same time , we believe contingency planning is only one element of [ORG NATO  ] 's [ORG Article  ] 5 preparedness . 
-- The [LOC United States  ] is prepared to work closely with [ORG NATO Military Authorities  ] and with other Allies to forge a consensus in favor of expanding [ORG EAGLE GUARDIAN  ] to include the defense of the [MISC Baltic  ] states , starting immediately in the new year when [ORG NATO  ] reopens following its winter break . 
( S/REL [ORG NATO  ] ) FOR [LOC WARSAW  ] -- The [LOC United States  ] has taken careful note of the repeated requests by all three [MISC Baltic  ] states for [ORG NATO  ] contingency planning for the defense of the [MISC Baltic  ] region . 
-- The [LOC United States  ] believes that [ORG NATO  ] - as a matter of course - should conduct appropriate contingency planning for the possible defense of Allied territory and populations . 
[ORG NATO  ] 's [ORG Article  ] 5 commitment requires no less . 
-- As President [PER Obama  ] said in [LOC Prague:  ] " We must work together as [ORG NATO  ] members so that we have contingency plans in place to deal with new threats , wherever they may come from . 
" -- After spending the last several months examining options for how to carry out [ORG NATO  ] contingency planning for the [MISC Baltic  ] states , the [LOC United States  ] has decided that the best course of action would be to take advantage of the ongoing revision of the existing defense of [LOC Poland  ] plan , [ORG EAGLE GUARDIAN  ] . 
[ORG EAGLE GUARDIAN  ] could be expanded to include the defense of the [MISC Baltic  ] states . 
-- This expansion is a logical military extension of the existing contingency plan and fits well within the scenario posited by [ORG EAGLE GUARDIAN  ] . 
In fact , defending [LOC Poland  ] necessarily entails defending the [MISC Baltic  ] states , as well . 
-- We would also like to make clear that we see the expansion of [ORG EAGLE GUARDIAN  ] as a step toward the possible expansion of [ORG NATO  ] 's other existing country-specific contingency plans into regional plans . 
This is the first step in a multi- stage process to develop a complete set of appropriate contingency plans for the full range of possible threats - both regional and functional - as soon as possible . 
At the same time , we believe contingency planning is only one element of [ORG NATO  ] 's [ORG Article  ] 5 preparedness . 
-- The [LOC United States  ] is prepared to work closely with [ORG NATO Military Authorities  ] and with other Allies to forge a consensus in favor of expanding [ORG EAGLE GUARDIAN  ] to include the defense of the [MISC Baltic  ] states , starting immediately in the new year when [ORG NATO  ] reopens following its winter break . 
-- We do not believe that this will result in any significant delays for concluding the [ORG EAGLE GUARDIAN  ] revision . 
Nor do we believe that this in any way endangers planning for the defense of [LOC Poland  ] . 
In fact , we believe that the planning for the defense of [LOC Poland  ] will be much more robust with the inclusion of the [MISC Baltics  ] . 
( S/REL [ORG NATO  ] ) POINTS ABOUT PUBLIC DISCUSSION OF PLANS ( FOR USE AT POST'S DISCRETION ) -- The [LOC United States  ] believes strongly that such planning should not be discussed publicly . 
These military plans are classified at the [ORG NATO  ] SECRET level . 
-- The [MISC Alliance  ] has many public diplomacy tools at its disposal . 
Contingency planning is not one of them . 
What we should do is explore other public steps for demonstrating the vitality of [ORG Article  ] 5 , such as exercises , defense investment , and partnerships . 
-- Public discussion of contingency plans undermines their military value , giving insight into [ORG NATO  ] 's planning processes . 
This weakens the security of all Allies . 
-- Public discussion of the plan would also make it politically much more difficult for some Allies to support the [ORG EAGLE GUARDIAN  ] revision , creating divisions within the [MISC Alliance  ] and throwing the whole project into doubt . 
-- A public discussion of contingency planning would also likely lead to an unnecessary increase in [LOC NATO-Russia  ] tensions , something we should try to avoid as we work to improve practical cooperation in areas of common [LOC NATO-Russia  ] interest . 
-- We believe that the proposed revision of [ORG EAGLE GUARDIAN  ] is achievable and will represent a significant response to the [MISC Baltic  ] request for contingency planning . 
-- We hope that we can count on your support in these efforts , including on keeping discussions on [ORG NATO  ] contingency planning out of the public domain . 
-- We should work together on using exercises , defense investment , and partnerships to demonstrate to our publics that [ORG Article  ] 5 's value ultimately lies in [ORG NATO  ] 's capabilities and deterrence , rather than specific planning . 
( C ) FOR ALL ACTION POSTS -- IF ASKED Q: Why wait until the new year ? 
Why not start now ? 
[ORG A: NATO Headquarters  ] is heading into its winter break , when only a skeletal staff is in place . 
Our ability to achieve success in this matter will be substantially improved once senior Allied personnel have returned to work early in the new year . 
We pledge to take the matter up expeditiously at that time . 
Q: Will waiting until the new year give [ORG NATO Military Authorities  ] sufficient time to complete the revision of the [ORG EAGLE GUARDIAN  ] ? 
[ORG A: According  ] to our conversations with [ORG NATO  ] 's senior military authorities , beginning the process of incorporating the [MISC Baltic  ] states into [ORG EAGLE GUARDIAN  ] in early January still gives them sufficient time to complete the revision by February as originally planned. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [LOC Washington  ] strongly prefers that discussion of [ORG NATO  ] 's contingency plans in general , and the possible expansion of [ORG EAGLE GUARDIAN  ] in particular , remain in confidential channels . 
However , posts may use the points below if necessary in responding to public queries about these issues . 
( U ) PUBLIC/PRESS INQUIRIES -- IF ASKED: -- [ORG NATO  ] does not discuss specific plans . 
-- As a matter of course , however , [ORG NATO  ] does planning in order to be as prepared as possible for whatever situations might arise , particularly as relates to its ability to carrying out its [ORG Article  ] 5 commitments . 
-- Plans are not static . 
[ORG NATO  ] is constantly reviewing and revising its plans . 
-- [ORG NATO  ] planning , however , is an internal process designed to make the [MISC Alliance  ] as prepared as possible for future contingencies . 
It is not " aimed " at any other country . 
-- President [PER Obama  ] acknowledged this when he said at [LOC Prague  ] that " We must work together as [ORG NATO  ] members so that we have contingency plans in place to deal with new threats , wherever they may come from .
