( [ORG SBU  ] ) This is the third of three messages that aim to reveal a comprehensive background picture of [PER Jacob Zuma  ] , the President of the ruling [ORG African National Congress  ] party ( [ORG ANC  ] ) , who was inaugurated as the fourth post-apartheid president of [LOC South Africa  ] . 
The first message was released before [PER Zuma  ] was inaugurated , and the last two will be released following his ascendancy . 
End Summary. --------------------------- [PER Zuma  ] Destined for Greatness --------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The global emergence of the anti-apartheid and disinvestment movements gained momentum in the 1970s and the 1980’s , such that even the [ORG USG  ] adopted a sanctions policy against the apartheid regime . 
Under international diplomatic , political , military , and economic pressure , the SAG decided that apartheid was no longer sustainable . 
Negotiations with [PER Nelson Mandela  ] , who was serving a life sentence in [LOC Robben Island  ] , opened the door for his release from prison and the un-banning of the [ORG African National Congress  ] ( [ORG ANC  ] ) and other opposition and anti-apartheid political parties . 
When SAG President [PER F.W. de Klerk  ] un-banned the [ORG ANC  ] in 1990 , [PER Jacob Zuma  ] , the [ORG ANC’s Intelligence and Security  ] chief in exile , was one of the first high level [ORG ANC  ] operatives to return to [LOC South Africa  ] . 
[PER Zuma  ] immediately became involved in negotiations concerned with dismantling apartheid laws and governance , facilitating the repatriation of those in exile , as well as the release of all political prisoners . 
It was between 1990 and 1994 that [PER Zuma  ] achieved his most important success: negotiating an end to the spiral of violence between the [ORG ANC  ] and the [MISC Zulu-based  ] [ORG Inkatha Freedom Party  ] ( [ORG IFP  ] ) -- that believed in [MISC Zulu  ] tradition and primacy -- and resulted in thousands of politically-related deaths . 
[PER Zuma  ] is likely the most prominent [ORG ANC  ] [MISC Zulu  ] politician -- even eclipsing [PER Mangosuthu Buthelezi  ] . 
Moreover , his own [MISC Zulu  ] ethnicity and identity was a major asset , convincing the [ORG Zulus of KwaZulu Natal  ] to support the [ORG ANC’s  ] leadership , the new [ORG ANC  ] constitution , and reconciliation as he urged a non-violent way for the opposing political movements to communicate . 
Though sporadic outbreaks of [MISC Zulu-ANC  ] violence occurred up until 2009 , the intensity , frequency , and number of deaths have reduced to a very small fraction compared to the early 1990s . 
This achievement remains one of the most important bases for Zuma’s stature , popularity and support among the [ORG ANC  ] rank and file. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) For the decades of his imprisonment , [PER Mandela  ] was the most recognized icon of the [ORG ANC  ] as well as a global symbol of freedom , perseverance , and resistance to apartheid . 
Upon his release , he led the [ORG ANC’s  ] efforts to create a majority-based , multi-racial democratic system founded on a progressive constitution based on democratic best practices around the world . 
In the period before the end of apartheid following the 1994 election which made [PER Mandela  ] the first democratically-elected president of [LOC South Africa  ] , [PER Zuma  ] was appointed to key roles in the [ORG ANC  ] and participated in their political decisions and negotiations . 
In 1994 , his supporters say , he stepped aside so that [PER Thabo Mbeki  ] could stand unopposed as Mandela’s Deputy President . 
He had one unsuccessful campaign to become the premier of [ORG KwaZulu Natal  ] Qunsuccessful campaign to become the premier of [ORG KwaZulu Natal  ] and in 1994 was appointed the Deputy Premier of that province by his old comrade and sometimes adversary [PER Thabo Mbeki  ] . 
Between 1994 and 1996 , [PER Zuma  ] was [ORG KwaZulu Natal’s  ] provincial chairman of the [ORG ANC  ] as well as [ORG MEC  ] for [ORG Economic Development and Tourism  ] . 
In 1996 , he was re-elected as Chair of the [ORG ANC  ] in [ORG KwaZulu Natal  ] and the same year became the [ORG ANC’s National Chairperson  ] -- one of the top six jobs in the party. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) His highest office -- prior to his current status as President-elect of [LOC South Africa  ] following a vote in [LOC Parliament  ] on May 6 , 2009 -- was [ORG ANC  ] Deputy President and Member of [LOC Parliament  ] , as he served as Deputy State President in the [PER Mbeki  ] Administration from 1999 to 2005 . 
Upon attaining the party Deputy Presidency , by tradition of succession in the [ORG ANC  ] , [PER Zuma  ] was believed to be Mbeki’s heir apparent , destined to succeed to the presidency in his time . 
But there were bumps in the road . 
He served as an unofficial [LOC PRETORIA  ] 00000954 002.2 OF 004 peace mediator and diplomatic troubleshooter in the region ( [LOC Zimbabwe  ] , [LOC Burundi  ] , and the [LOC Democratic Republic  ] of the [LOC Congo  ] ) and helped the [ORG ANC  ] build a rapport with trade unions , traditional leaders , and other political parties . 
[PER Zuma  ] developed the reputation of being humble , charismatic , loyal , hard-working , and committed to improving the lives of [MISC South Africans  ] . 
In 1999 , based on this profile , he was appointed Deputy President of the [ORG ANC  ] and became the Deputy President of [LOC South Africa  ] in the first [PER Mbeki  ] administration . 
He was dismissed by [PER Mbeki  ] as SAG Deputy President in 2005 as a result of being implicated in the corruption trial of his friend and financial advisor [PER Schabir Shaik  ] . 
In 2006 , he was charged with rape of a family friend , but was acquitted . 
Following Shaik’s conviction of bribing [PER Zuma  ] for personal gain , [PER Zuma  ] was indicted and charged with multiple counts of corruption , accepting bribes , tax evasion , and money laundering. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Zuma’s rise to the pinnacle of [MISC South African  ] politics at the same time that serious questions about his character were headline news is an astonishing political achievement in itself . 
[PER Zuma  ] is known as a populist whose rise occurred in partnership with leftist constituencies in the [ORG ANC  ] . 
Despite criminal allegations against him , he remained popular in the party , unlike [PER Mbeki  ] who came to be hated . 
[PER Zuma  ] is particularly popular among [MISC Zulu  ] ethnic and [ORG Youth Leagues  ] ; their defense of him claims he has served the people well , there are others worse than him , and he is much better than [PER Mbeki  ] . 
Some of his most ardent supporters promised to kill and die for him while others threatened that if [PER Zuma  ] were to be convicted , “blood would flow” and they would make the country “ungovernable.” To them , [PER Zuma  ] had a “right” to be president . 
[PER Mbeki  ] believed that a [PER Zuma  ] presidency would be a disaster for [LOC South Africa  ] and would split the [ORG ANC  ] . 
Zuma’s supporters counter-claimed that [PER Mbeki  ] was a disaster for the poor and he was the one splitting the party , creating a strong presidency that acted without reference to party instruction . 
In 2007 , well after the conviction of his friend [PER Shaik  ] for bribery and corruption , [PER Zuma  ] was also indicted for having a corrupt relationship with [PER Shaik  ] . 
The charges were set aside in September 2008 due to lack of preparedness by the prosecutors to proceed with the case. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Despite Mbeki’s intellect and experience as well as his apparent success as a leader , politician , and diplomat , [PER Zuma  ] out-maneuvered him by manipulating the party base through the district offices and portraying himself as the victim via the image-making machinery of the [ORG ANC  ] . 
Pundits thought [PER Mbeki  ] was the smartest and most effective political leader of his generation , but on December 17 , 2007 in [LOC Polokwane  ] , [LOC Limpopo  ] , the [ORG ANC  ] declared [PER Zuma  ] the clear favorite , beginning Mbeki’s surprising slide into political obscurity . 
Days following his election , corruption charges were re-filed against [PER Zuma  ] , causing a leadership crisis in the [ORG ANC  ] that was only resolved in September 2008 when the [MISC Zuma-led  ] [ORG NEC  ] forced [PER Mbeki  ] to resign as President of [LOC South Africa  ] -- a deliberate act of triumphant revenge just eight months short of the end of his second five year term . 
[PER Kgalema Motlanthe  ] ( septel ) , Qof his second five year term . 
[PER Kgalema Motlanthe  ] ( septel ) , the [ORG ANC  ] Deputy President , was sworn in as [MISC South Africa’s  ] third post-apartheid president , but his seven month tenure was purposefully that of a care-taker , marking time until the president in waiting took office. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Following a year-and-a-half of controversial high profile court challenges , appeals , and counter-suits , all charges against [PER Zuma  ] were dropped only weeks before the election in April 2009 . 
His supporters’ adoration only grew as his detractors characterized him as an unlettered and corrupt buffoon surrounded by crass and intimidating socialist sycophants . 
[PER Zuma  ] loyalists ignored critiques that he is a charismatic populist and political chameleon who tells each audience exactly what they want to hear , that he is a man without his own vision or policy center . 
His supporters understand that [PER Zuma  ] has one over-riding policy -- loyalty to the [ORG ANC  ] and improving the lives of the rural poor above all else. -------------------------- Keys To Zuma’s Personality -------------------------- [LOC PRETORIA  ] 00000954 003.2 OF 004 <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Zuma  ] has clearly weathered numerous storms during recent years and he used several tactics of political survival that give clues to his personality and leadership style . 
First , he used the power of persuasion to build strong alliances . 
Faced with enormous challenges to his political career , [PER Zuma  ] built a strong support team and pulled his family close to him . 
He also relied heavily on his contacts in [ORG KwaZulu Natal  ] Second , he leveraged on the infrastructure and networks of his friends . 
The perceived political conspiracy against [PER Zuma  ] became a reality in the minds of many [MISC South Africans  ] -- including [ORG Pietermaritzburg High Court  ] Judge [PER Chris Nicholson  ] -- and this triggered a groundswell of sympathy for him . 
The [ORG ANC Youth League  ] , the [MISC Congress of  ] [MISC South African Trade Unions  ] ( [ORG COSATU  ] ) , and the [MISC South African  ] [ORG Communist Party  ] ( [ORG SACP  ] ) gave him a political platform to express his views . 
He also worked closely with business people who had local and international networks . 
They extended their influence so he could counter the negative images that his adversaries had built of him . 
Third , he remained focused on key tasks . 
Throughout the political crisis he faced after [PER Mbeki  ] fired him , [PER Zuma  ] focused on his oft-repeated assertion that he was innocent and that he was the victim of a systematic abuse of power . 
Fourth , [PER Zuma  ] understood that the main thrust of the political conspiracy would have been to remove him from the [ORG ANC  ] , and the [ORG ANC  ] from him . 
His best response would be to live the values of the [ORG ANC  ] throughout the crisis period , and become the epitome of an [ORG ANC  ] cadre -- which he did . 
He built extensive relationships in Parliament and with [ORG ANC  ] branches across the country . 
As he began to live the values of the [ORG ANC  ] , the ruling party found it more difficult to distance itself from him. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Fifth , [PER Zuma  ] delegated effectively while never abandoning his responsibilities . 
[PER Zuma  ] is outstanding at delegating jobs to those around him . 
According to those closest to [PER Zuma  ] , “his demeanor in the face of adversity helped to create a positive atmosphere inside his war-rooms.” Sixth , he always maintained the moral high ground and remained authentic throughout . 
No matter how hard detractors tried to break his spirit by name-calling and leaking information , [PER Zuma  ] never lost his composure . 
In the midst of his toughest times , [PER Zuma  ] visited his working-class supporters and the unemployed . 
Seventh , he improvised his communication methods -- and found success doing so . 
When he realized that much of the media in [LOC South Africa  ] was against him becoming the next leader , he resorted to positive imagery . 
He became the dignified underdog , and he painted those against him as shameless bullies and cowards . 
Last , [PER Zuma  ] used smart aggression as a tool to wear down his opponents . 
Throughout the most difficult times of the past few years , [PER Zuma  ] came across as reluctant to draw first blood , only displaying subtle determination to take the fight to his aggressors . 
This is consistent with a leader that is aware of his own strengths -- smart power. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As Zuma’s presidency begins , many outstanding questions remain about his government and his policies . 
His close association with the ideological left of the [ORG ANC  ] Qclose association with the ideological left of the [ORG ANC  ] alliance has raised some worries about the impact on economic policy by close [PER Zuma  ] allies in the [ORG SACP  ] and [ORG COSATU  ] . 
He has reassured investors their assets will be secure under his administration , but has also called for the redistribution of wealth in the interests of the poor . 
The [ORG ANC  ] has led the world to expect a more intimate intertwining of the ruling party and the state as well as a deployment of public officials whose standard of conduct and effectiveness will be their loyalty to [PER Zuma  ] and the [ORG ANC  ] and their willingness to carry out [ORG ANC  ] policies . 
With a relatively weak opposition but respected courts and activist civil society , there is optimism that a [LOC Zuma  ] administration will , at worst , muddle through . 
There are many top performers in the [ORG ANC  ] , and the [ORG ANC  ] tradition of collective decision-making will define the policy context of the [PER Zuma  ] administration . 
One can only guess how [LOC South Africa  ] will evolve under a [ORG Zuma  ] presidency -- which he promises will only be for one term . 
[MISC South Africans  ] have suffered many more and greater tragedies than an elected government with a near two-thirds majority . 
It is trite to [LOC PRETORIA  ] 00000954 004.2 OF 004 say , but “time will tell.” In this case , such a statement rings true for [LOC South Africa  ] in 2009 .
