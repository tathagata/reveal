[LOC BEIJING  ] 3090 [LOC B. BEIJING  ] 3102 Classified By: Economic Minister Counselor [PER William Weinstein  ] ; Reasons 1 .4 ( b , d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary . 
Vice Minister [PER Liu He  ] of the [ORG Central Leading Group  ] on [ORG Financial  ] and [ORG Economic Affairs  ] ( [ORG CLGFEA  ] ) told Under Secretary for [ORG Economic  ] , Energy , and [ORG Agricultural Affairs  ] Hormats on November 9 that the small number of bilateral trade conflicts generates disproportionate political and social impact in both countries . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] Government understands the need to resolve these conflicts and to build mutual trust . 
On rebalancing , [PER Liu  ] agreed that [LOC U.S.  ] savings and [MISC Chinese  ] consumption both need to rise , with both sides having “a long way to go.” [PER Liu  ] is involved in preparation of [ORG China’s  ] next [ORG Five-Year Plan  ] ( covering 2011-15 ) , two core elements of which will be boosting domestic demand , especially consumption , and promoting urbanization . 
Other policies , including those related to education , social safety net , low-income housing , and infrastructure would flow from these rebalancing themes. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Summary , continued . 
Both [PER Liu  ] and [ORG Chinese Academy of Social Sciences  ] ( [ORG CASS  ] ) , [ORG Institute of World Economics and Politics  ] Director [PER Zhang Yuyan  ] voiced concerns about possible future inflation in the [LOC United States  ] , which could erode the value of [LOC China’s USD-denominated  ] investments , and about [ORG USG  ] and [ORG Federal Reserve  ] exit strategies from stimulus programs . 
On exchange rates , [PER Zhang  ] acknowledged the need for [LOC China  ] to alter its system and said several options are under consideration , including return to the July 2005-August 2008 peg system , using either the [ORG SDR  ] or a trade-weighted basket of currencies rather than the USD as the peg . 
He said two arguments in favor of [ORG RMB  ] appreciation were that an undervalued currency caused [LOC China  ] effectively to subsidize foreign consumers , and that pressure on [LOC China  ] from the rest of the world was rising . 
On the other hand , [LOC China  ] feared currency appreciation would cause more bankruptcies in [LOC China’s  ] exporting coastal regions . 
End Summary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In his separate meetings with [PER Liu  ] and [PER Zhang  ] , [PER U/S Hormats  ] emphasized that his goal was not to use this visit to negotiate , but to get a sense of what was on the minds of [MISC Chinese  ] policy makers as they considered future plans and strategies . 
The conversations were remarkably candid . 
[PER U/S Hormats’  ] other meetings are reported in reftels . 
Trade Frictions: Small Numbers , Large Impact -------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Noting the need for a strategic approach to bilateral relations , [PER U/S Hormats  ] told Vice Minister [PER Liu  ] the most complicated current issues are trade and rebalancing . 
On trade , the areas of friction actually are very small as a percentage of overall trade , but the disputes sometimes get blown out of proportion . 
[PER Liu  ] described the trade conflicts as “terrible , ” with the small number of disputes having huge political and social impact in both countries . 
He believed [LOC U.S.  ] labor unions and upcoming mid-term ( 2010 ) [LOC U.S.  ] elections both increase pressure for trade protectionism in the [LOC U.S.  ] In [LOC China  ] , [PER Liu  ] said local governments want to protect their own tax bases and industries . 
The two sides need to work together to resolve these problems for the good of both countries and the rest of the world. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER U/S Hormats  ] observed that the upcoming visit of President [PER Obama  ] to [LOC China  ] presents an opportunity to conclude agreements on clean energy and/or climate change . 
These are very high priorities for the [LOC United States  ] and would benefit our overall relationship . 
He also stressed the need to have further talks led by USTR Ambassador [PER Kirk  ] and Secretary of [LOC Commerce Locke  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] aims to resolve trade issues if possible through discussion and negotiation , [PER Hormats  ] emphasized . 
[PER Liu  ] said the [MISC Chinese  ] Government understands the need to resolve the trade disputes . 
He also agreed on the need to maintain dialogue on major strategic issues for the medium and long terms , observing that “we need each other” but at the same time distrust each other in many ways . 
Rebalancing ----------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Vice Minister [PER Liu  ] concurred with [PER U/S Hormats  ] that [LOC U.S.  ] savings and [MISC Chinese  ] consumption need to rise , and said both sides have “a long way to go.” For the first nine months of 2009 , [MISC China’s  ] GDP growth reached 7.7 percent , including [LOC BEIJING  ] 00003122 002 OF 003 increases of seven percent in domestic investment and four percent in consumption , with negative 3.6 percent growth in net exports ; [PER Liu  ] said this demonstrates [MISC China’s  ] efforts to boost consumption in the short term. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Liu  ] said he had met that morning with senior leaders to discuss preparations for the 12th [ORG Five-Year Plan  ] ( covering 2011-15 ) . 
Two core elements of the plan will be boosting domestic demand , especially consumption , and promoting urbanization . 
Other policies , including those related to education , social safety net , low-income housing , and infrastructure would flow from these rebalancing themes . 
[PER Liu  ] believes the [LOC U.S.  ] economy will require 2-3 years to recover from the global crisis , during which time [MISC China’s  ] external markets will remain shrunken . 
He claimed [MISC China’s  ] leaders had formulated a new development strategy in 2007 , before onset of the global crisis , to promote rebalancing away from exports and industrial investment in favor of technological progress and domestic consumption . 
( Comment: [PER Liu  ] did not expand upon the urbanization topic , but the next plan presumably will address many of the social needs and consequences generated by [MISC China’s  ] relatively rapid and continuing urbanization trend . 
Expansion of programs to address needs for housing , health care , education , and other social services for recent urban migrants and their families would correlate closely with overall rebalancing initiatives . 
End Comment . 
) [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Economy: Watching  ] and Worrying ----------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Vice Minister [PER Liu  ] said he was “a little worried” about the path of the [LOC U.S.  ] economy , fearing it might be reverting to the past model: the [ORG Fed  ] was “printing lots of money” and the stock market , which “has no memory , ” was rising too fast . 
After hearing assurances from [PER U/S Hormats  ] about the [LOC U.S.  ] desire to assure that a strong recovery took hold and ongoing [ORG Federal Reserve  ] and [ORG USG  ] vigilance to avoid repetition of the financial excesses of the past , [PER Liu  ] appeared reassured about the soundness of the [LOC U.S.  ] approach but said both countries needed to pay attention to any future “bubbles.” A return by [LOC China  ] to its old ways and traditional growth path would not be good for [LOC China  ] or the world , he said . 
[ORG CASS  ] Director [PER Zhang  ] also was concerned about possible future inflation in the [LOC United States  ] that could erode the value of [LOC China’s USD-denominated  ] investments . 
He inquired about [ORG USG  ] and [ORG Fed  ] exit strategies from stimulus programs and progress on health care reform and climate change legislation . 
( Comment: The concerns of [PER Liu  ] and [PER Zhang  ] about the [LOC U.S.  ] economy parallel those expressed by various other economic policy officials in recent meetings . 
End Comment . 
) Exchange Rates -------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [ORG CASS  ] Director [PER Zhang  ] said the renminbi ( [ORG RMB  ] ) exchange rate is a current discussion and research topic at [ORG CASS  ] and within the government , and there might be “some surprise” in the coming months . 
As [LOC China  ] moved toward more domestic demand-based economic growth , it would need to alter its exchange rate system . 
One possibility would be return to a system similar to the July 2005-August 2008 peg , using either the [ORG SDR  ] or a trade-weighted basket of currencies rather than just the [LOC USD  ] as the peg . 
[PER Zhang  ] observed that his predecessor as [ORG CASS  ] Director , Professor [PER Yu Yongding  ] , had been a strong proponent of a sharp appreciation ( ten or more percent ) of the [ORG RMB  ] against the [LOC USD  ] . 
[PER Zhang  ] said two arguments in favor of [ORG RMB  ] appreciation were that an undervalued currency caused [LOC China  ] effectively to subsidize foreign consumers , and that pressure on [LOC China  ] from the rest of the world was rising . 
On the other hand , the [MISC Chinese  ] Government feared currency appreciation would cause more bankruptcies in the exporting coastal regions. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Zhang  ] said he recently visited [LOC Japan  ] for discussion of exchange rates , among other issues . 
In his opinion , [LOC China  ] now is “at a crossroads” and faces two main options: first , moving with other countries in the region to some form of common [MISC Asian  ] currency ; or second ( and more likely ) , keeping the [ORG RMB  ] independent with a view toward playing a greater international role in the future . 
[ORG CASS  ] senior fellow [PER Jie Sun  ] added that two possible currency baskets were under consideration: a more traditional basket of major currencies including the [LOC USD  ] , or a regional currency basket , although the latter option would be difficult due to lack of any regional surveillance system . 
[PER Zhang  ] added that a paper published in March 2009 by [ORG People’s Bank of China  ] Governor [LOC BEIJING  ] 00003122 003 OF 003 [PER Zhou Xiaochuan  ] advocating development of another world currency , possibly based on the [ORG SDR  ] , represented [MISC Zhou’s  ] “personal view” but also reflected dissatisfaction with the existing system among some [MISC Chinese  ] officials and economists. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER U/S Hormats  ] has cleared this cable .
