Summary: The one-year anniversary of the March 15 , 2006 announcement of the closing of [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Naval Air Station  ] [ORG Keflavik  ] ( [ORG NASKEF  ] ) passed quietly , marked only by the announcement that part of the former base will become a university-level institution focusing on international education and technology . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
There was no media coverage of the base closing in the weeks leading up to the anniversary of the announcement . 
On March 14 , the day before the anniversary , Prime Minister [PER Geir H. Haarde  ] mentioned in a speech to the [ORG Althing  ] ( [ORG Parliament  ] ) that the base closing , although unexpected , had resulted in the transfer of valuable property to the [LOC Iceland  ] and opened economic development opportunities. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
[PER Haarde  ] 's speech was a prelude to a ceremony held in the base 's former chapel on March 15 unveiling the plans for a university-level education center . 
The ceremony was covered March 16 by leading daily Morgunbladid , under the headline , " Moving Forward at [ORG Keflavik Base  ] . 
" During the ceremony local officials of [PER Reykjanesbaer  ] , the [ORG Keflavik Airport Development Corporation  ] ( [ORG Kadeco  ] ) and the University of [LOC Iceland  ] signed a declaration of intent in cooperation with several business enterprises to establish a new international academic community on part of the former base . 
The plan is to exploit the area 's strengths including energy , air traffic and services and international affairs . 
Representatives of businesses , including [ORG Icelandair  ] , The [ORG Blue Lagoon  ] , [LOC Glitnir  ] bank , [ORG Geysir Green Energy  ] , and the air traffic control [ORG Flugstodir  ] , were also present. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
Local officials could barely contain their glee . 
" We are forging plowshares out of swords , " declared [PER Reykjanesbaer Mayor  ] [PER Arni Sigfusson  ] at the signing ceremony . 
He said one of the most attractive characteristics of the base is its close proximity to [ORG Keflavik International Airport  ] . 
" You could say this is an ideal location . 
" In a later interview with nationwide broadcaster [MISC RUV-Radio  ] , [PER Mayor Sigfusson  ] said the base had " first-class " facilities , and that the sports facilities , which include a gymnasium , large indoor swimming pool and gymnastic equipment , are probably the best in the entire country. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
[PER Runolfur Agustsson  ] , former rector at [ORG Bifrost University  ] , has been studying the feasibility of a university at the base site . 
He said the aim of the educational center will be three-fold: to strengthen the general educational level in [PER Reykjanesbaer  ] , to strengthen vocational training in the area , and to stress university-level education in [MISC English  ] to attract more foreign students and teachers . 
He said the structure of the educational center has not yet been determined , but he believes a university preparatory department could begin operations in the fall . 
" We foresee an academic community of 1800-2000 people in seven years' time , " he said . 
[PER Agustsson  ] said he expects the University of [LOC Iceland  ] to be the key participant in the project. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
The CEO of [ORG Kadeco  ] , [PER Jon Astradur Jonsson  ] , told post that the university project is not the only project planned for the base . 
He said that there are still several others in the works . 
[PER Jonsson  ] said that the buildings are pretty much in " move-in " condition for the university , so minimal work will need to be done. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
Embassy Comment: The lack of media and press attention to the anniversary of the announcement underlines that the steam has gone out of the issue of the base closure-as [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] leader [PER Ossur Skarphedinsson  ] told the Ambassador this week , [LOC Iceland  ] has " moved on to other issues . 
" The reiteration at the ceremony yesterday that the [LOC U.S.  ] had left the facilities in first-class condition was a welcome acknowledgement of the fine work of former base commander Captain [PER Mark Laughton  ] and his team in maintaining and then shutting down the base . 
The establishment of a university on the former base will be an excellent use of the real estate and facilities we turned over , and will have a permanent impact on the wellbeing of the [MISC Icelandic  ] public .
