( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: [LOC Iceland  ] 's Prime Minister [PER Haarde  ] presented the results of the last six months of [LOC U.S.-Iceland  ] defense talks to his political opposition , the parliamentary foreign affairs committee , and the nation in meetings and an hour-long televised press conference September 26 . 
[PER Haarde  ] - with the leader of the minority party in the coalition government by his side - described the provisions of the " [ORG Technical Agreement  ] " to close [LOC Naval Air Station  ] Keflavik and the " [MISC Joint Understanding  ] " describing the way ahead in the bilateral security relationship , as well as a list of new [MISC Icelandic  ] government initiatives on security issues . 
The opposition has yet to respond forcefully , perhaps intimidated by the breadth and depth of the defense framework [PER Haarde  ] has presented. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Following the PM 's announcement , Ambassador gave interviews to key [MISC Icelandic  ] media , the first step in a rollout campaign to affirm [LOC America  ] 's continuing commitment to [MISC Icelandic  ] security and our intention to help [LOC Iceland  ] develop ( through , e.g. , exercises , training , and defense industrial cooperation ) the capability to contribute more to its own security . 
That the [ORG GOI  ] also unveiled some initiatives of its own - including a strategic studies think tank - reinforces our view that [PER Haarde  ] 's government is now ready to break with [PER Cold War-think  ] and look seriously at how it can do its part to protect its people from contemporary threats . 
End summary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) During the last round of [MISC U.S.-Iceland  ] defense talks in [LOC Washington  ] September 14 , both sides were able to reach agreement on a technical agreement for the closure of [LOC Naval Air Station  ] Keflavik ( [ORG NASKEF  ] ) , a political " [MISC Joint Understanding  ] " on the way forward for defense relations , and amendments to certain classified annexes to the original 1951 Defense Agreement between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Iceland  ] . 
Prime Minister and [ORG Independence Party  ] head [PER Geir Haarde  ] met with opposition party members and the [ORG Althingi  ] ( parliament ) foreign affairs committee on 26 September to brief on the substance of the agreements . 
[PER Haarde  ] followed this at the end of the day with a pre-announced , nationally-broadcast press conference. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) In his hour-long press conference , [PER Haarde  ] - joined as in the other meetings by his junior coalition partner , Minister of [ORG Commerce  ] [PER Jon Sigurdsson  ] of the [ORG Progressive Party  ] , stepping in for the absent Foreign Minister - proclaimed himself satisfied with the results of the negotiations and affirmed that there was no fundamental change to the terms of the 1951 Agreement . 
He noted that he had spoken to [PER U/S Burns  ] earlier in the day to confirm that all the details were taken care of on the [LOC U.S.  ] side , and said Foreign Minister [PER Sverisdottir  ] and an appropriate official on the [ORG USG  ] side would sign the [ORG Technical Agreement  ] within the next few days . 
[PER Haarde  ] said he and the Foreign Minister will travel to [LOC Washington  ] to sign the [MISC Joint Understanding  ] in the next month. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Haarde  ] also unveiled a list ( some not previously raised with the [ORG USG  ] ) of additional [ORG GOI  ] initiatives for both the base transition and defense planning tracks , including: --creation of a publicly-owned development corporation to manage the conversion of the former [ORG NASKEF  ] site to civilian use ; --creation of a cabinet-level body similar to a national security council , with its first task the review of all public security legislation ; --increased interagency cooperation between police , [ORG Icelandic Coast Guard  ] ( [ORG ICG  ] ) , and emergency services ; --purchase of new fixed-wing aircraft and ships for the [ORG ICG  ] after new [ORG ICG  ] helicopter acquisition is completed ; and --creation of a think tank on security issues to include representatives from all political parties. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) At the press conference , [PER Haarde  ] described at some length the substance of the [MISC Joint Understanding  ] and [MISC Technical Agreement  ] , noting at several points the government 's satisfaction at the outcome of the negotiations . 
In particular , he described the [ORG USG  ] 's ongoing commitment to defend [LOC Iceland  ] , which he noted goes beyond the guarantees offered by [ORG NATO  ] membership . 
The PM pointed to the [MISC Joint Understanding  ] 's provisions on the intent to hold annual exercises in [LOC Iceland  ] , and expressed his confidence that such exercises would underline the [LOC U.S.  ] military 's ability to defend [LOC Iceland  ] with mobile , agile forces . 
He also described the [ORG GOI  ] 's hopes for further engagement with [LOC U.S.  ] law enforcement agencies as well as the [ORG U.S. Coast Guard  ] , as set out in the [MISC Joint Understanding  ] . 
[ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000357 002.4 OF 002 <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) [PER Haarde  ] also devoted considerable time to the issue of environmental mitigation at the [ORG NASKEF  ] site , noting that the two governments had expended considerable effort on the matter . 
Commenting that it is simply not possible to run an airport without pollution , [PER Haarde  ] outlined [LOC U.S.  ] military efforts at environmental cleanup over the years and emphasized that of the known 60 sites with some form of pollution , none are known to pose a danger to human health . 
The [ORG PM  ] said the [ORG GOI  ] was pleased with the information it had received from the [LOC U.S.  ] military on environmental issues and said this information and further plans for environmental mitigation efforts would be made public. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) For his part , Minister of [ORG Commerce  ] [PER Jon Sigurdsson  ] ( standing in for Foreign Minister and fellow [ORG Progressive Party  ] member [PER Valgerdur Sverrisdottir  ] , in [LOC New York  ] for the [ORG UN General Assembly  ] ) affirmed his party 's support for the agreements , and was even more direct than the [ORG PM  ] on the need for [LOC Iceland  ] to take a bigger responsibility for its own security . 
" We need to develop an independent capability so we can have a serious discussion about defense issues , " [PER Sigurdsson  ] noted during the [LOC Q&A  ] period following the [ORG PM  ] 's presentation. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) Initial reaction from opposition politicians was muted , as they sought to absorb and interpret the broad program [PER Haarde  ] had outlined: -- The leading opposition [ORG Alliance  ] party deployed parliamentary whip [PER Ossur Skarphedinsson  ] , who welcomed the government 's proposals for a multi-party security think tank and increased law enforcement and security agency cooperation . 
At the same time , [PER Skarphedinsson  ] complained that the talks' outcome still left Icelanders in doubt as to their security , as " no [MISC Icelander  ] except for two ministers has seen " the [ORG EUCOM  ] defense plan for [LOC Iceland  ] . 
-- Left-Green Chairman [PER Steingrimur Sigfusson  ] , a declared pacifist , welcomed the departure of [LOC U.S.  ] forces but criticized the [ORG GOI  ] for permitting the [LOC U.S.  ] to leave without bearing full responsibility for environmental issues on the base . 
He stated his opposition to future exercises and defense cooperation as outlined in the agreements , saying he had hoped [LOC Iceland  ] would take the opportunity to abrogate the 1951 bilateral agreement and establish an independent foreign policy. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Following the [ORG PM  ] 's announcement , Ambassador gave interviews to several of [LOC Iceland  ] 's leading media outlets . 
We plan to continue our outreach efforts in the media and with contacts from numerous affinity groups ( e.g. parliamentarians , business leaders , students ) over the days ahead. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Comment:  ] The [ORG PM  ] played it straight during his press conference outlining the defense agreements , delving into the finer details of the agreements with confidence . 
His comprehensive overview of the documents will likely help to counter some criticism - already being voiced by opposition party members seemingly too overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information they received today to mount a nuanced riposte - that the [ORG GOI  ] could have " gotten a better deal " if it had been better prepared for the talks . 
Similarly , [PER Haarde  ] 's efforts to keep the focus on future bilateral cooperation in defense and security affairs , as well as the unveiling of a list of domestic [ORG GOI  ] initiatives in this area , will be to our benefit as we seek to expand on this message in the weeks and months ahead . 
One indication of how far the conversation on security affairs has come in six months was the [ORG PM  ] 's use of the phrase " a new chapter " in [MISC Iceland-U.S.  ] relations , the same metaphor that [MISC Icelandic  ] media - convinced the base closure would bring to an end the [MISC U.S.-Iceland  ] security saga - excoriated [LOC U.S.  ] officials for using back in March .
