( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary . 
On January 20 , 2010 , Under Secretary [PER Bill Burns  ] and Defense Under Secretary for Policy [PER Michele Flournoy  ] hosted the third U.S.-France [ORG Strategic Dialogue  ] with counterparts [PER Jacques Audibert  ] and [PER Michel Miraillet  ] . 
Discussions focused on [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Pakistan  ] , [ORG NATO Reform  ] , [ORG Missile Defense  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , and the [LOC Middle East Peace Process  ] . 
The [MISC French  ] indicated an announcement of further civilian contributions to [LOC Afghanistan  ] would be made at the [ORG London Conference  ] , but hedged on a decision regarding additional combat troops . 
On [ORG NATO  ] 's new [ORG Strategic Concept  ] , the [MISC French  ] highlighted the potential for a split in the Alliance between old and new members , and agreed that a document that linked to [ORG NATO  ] reform measures was needed . 
The [MISC French  ] requested more information on the [LOC U.S.  ] proposal to make [LOC Missile Defense  ] a mission for [ORG NATO  ] . 
Both [PER U/S Burns  ] and [PER USD  ] ( P ) [PER Flournoy  ] underscored that the potential sale of a [MISC French  ] [MISC Mistral-class Helicopter  ] carrier to [LOC Russia  ] would be unhelpful in terms of regional stability . 
Next steps on [LOC Iran  ] were discussed with the [MISC French  ] agreeing that the [ORG European Union  ] ( [ORG EU  ] ) was more unified than ever on the need for increased pressure and welcoming [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to engage the [ORG EU  ] as a whole on this issue . 
End Summary. ------------------------ [LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] AND [LOC PAKISTAN  ] ------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER U/S Burns  ] praised the [MISC French  ] contributions and previewed [LOC U.S.  ] goals for the [ORG London Conference  ] on [LOC Afghanistan  ] , which included agreement on growing the [ORG Afghan National Security Forces  ] ( [ORG ANSF  ] ) , reintegration , and choosing a new [ORG UN  ] Senior Representative for [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER USD  ] ( P ) reviewed the [ORG POTUS  ] decision and highlighted that July 11 , 2011 was an inflection point -- the beginning of a process . 
She noted that [ORG POTUS  ] was careful to not create an artificial timeline for transition to [MISC Afghan  ] responsibility and that the [LOC U.S.  ] message to the region is that " we are not leaving . 
" Deputy [PER SRAP Jones  ] described the new [LOC U.S.  ] regional stability strategy and our efforts to align [PER Karzai  ] with the international community 's civilian priorities. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Audibert  ] remarked on [LOC France  ] 's " special " commitment to [LOC Afghanistan  ] based on [LOC France  ] leading the invocation of [ORG NATO  ] 's [ORG Article  ] 5 after 9/11 . 
Nine years later , the [MISC French  ] cite Allied unity as the mission 's principal success . 
[LOC France  ] believes the President 's announcement of 30,000 more troops substantively changed the operation . 
While the [LOC London  ] conference is a chance to impress upon [MISC Afghan  ] President [PER Hamid Karzai  ] that he must implement the commitments in his inauguration speech , the [MISC French  ] are concerned it might be too early to put too much political pressure on [PER Karzai  ] . 
[PER Audibert  ] suggested a second international conference on [LOC Afghanistan  ] in the spring would be helpful and was pleased to hear about plans for an April conference in [LOC Kabul  ] . 
[PER Audibert  ] also stated that [LOC France  ] will make an announcement about its " civilian surge " at the [LOC London  ] conference , but that commitments on further troop deployments were not ready . 
[PER Miraillet  ] lamented [MISC French  ] public opposition to the war in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , but believed that the government was making progress in convincing the [MISC French  ] people of the necessity for the operation . 
He also explained that the military staff had developed several plans for additional contributions , which were now with President [PER Sarkozy  ] for action. ---------------------- [ORG NATO  ] STRATEGIC CONCEPT ---------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Audibert  ] noted that the [ORG Strategic Concept  ] ( [ORG SC  ] ) was " not a redrafting of the [LOC Washington Treaty  ] , " and should not open troublesome issues such as new missions and redefining [ORG Article  ] 5 . 
He further emphasized that [LOC France  ] wanted to stay as close to the 1999 [ORG Strategic Concept  ] as possible on language STATE 00013750 002 OF 004 relating to [ORG NATO  ] nuclear issues . 
[PER Audibert  ] highlighted the risk of a split between old and newer members of the Alliance on these questions and advocated for a short , simple document . 
The [MISC French  ] want to use the [ORG Strategic Concept  ] to drive reform at [ORG NATO  ] . 
He noted that [LOC France  ] had submitted several proposals on reform and that [LOC France  ] was keen for [LOC U.S.  ] support . 
[PER Miraillet  ] added that with the dire state of [ORG NATO  ] financing , it was important to stress financial reform even before the drafting of the [ORG Strategic Concept  ] . 
[PER Miraillet  ] also warned that [PER SecGen Rasmussen  ] might put a tight grip on drafting the concept and cautioned that [LOC Turkey  ] would play a stronger role in drafting than in 1999. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) [PER USD  ] ( P ) asserted that the [LOC U.S.  ] has played a leading role in the Senior Officials Group ( [ORG SOG  ] ) because of our strong commitment to [ORG NATO  ] reform . 
On the [ORG SC  ] , she said it was important that the key Allies make their input to the [PER SecGen  ] before pen was put to paper . 
Further , [PER USD  ] ( P ) clarified that the [LOC U.S.  ] did not believe Alliance transformation could happen without financial reform and that it was a priority for the [ORG U.S. State Assistant  ] Secretary for [MISC European  ] and [ORG Eurasian Affairs  ] [PER Phil Gordon  ] agreed ; any misperception that the [LOC U.S.  ] did not want to link the [ORG Strategic Concept  ] to reform must be corrected . 
[ORG OSD Assistant  ] Secretary for [ORG International Security Affairs Alexander Vershbow  ] added that the new concept must put a public face on the Alliance and address issues for the future , such as [ORG Article  ] 4 and crisis management capacity . 
He agreed that reform of financing was critical as the current budget crisis evidenced . 
[ORG ASD Vershbow  ] stressed that we must work with the [LOC UK  ] to solve the financial crisis at [ORG NATO  ] and suggested that the idea of " zero real growth " be put aside . 
[PER Audibert  ] was pleased to hear that the [LOC U.S.  ] was on the same page as [LOC France  ] regarding reform and that this was a priority goal for the [MISC French  ] side during the [ORG Strategic Dialogue.  ] --------------- [ORG Missile Defense  ] --------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER USD  ] ( P ) briefed the [MISC French  ] on the current state of play regarding worldwide [LOC U.S.  ] missile defense plans . 
She noted that the [ORG Ballistic Missile Defense Review  ] ( [ORG BMDR  ] ) would soon be submitted to [ORG Congress  ] and noted the [ORG Phased Adaptive Approach  ] ( [ORG PAA  ] ) would be a [LOC U.S.  ] contribution to a [ORG NATO  ] Missile Defense project . 
This plan would protect both [LOC U.S.  ] forces and interests in [LOC Europe  ] and our [ORG NATO  ] Allies . 
[PER USD  ] ( P ) requested [MISC French  ] support for securing [ORG NATO  ] approval for the Active [ORG Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense  ] ( [ORG ALTBMD  ] ) program to become the [ORG Command and Control  ] ( [ORG C2  ] ) backbone of a wider [ORG European Missile Defense  ] program . 
[PER USD  ] ( P ) stressed that [ORG NATO  ] approval for the [ORG C2  ] relationship between [ORG ALTBMD  ] and the [ORG PAA  ] was important as [LOC Turkey  ] was unlikely to approve participation unless it was part of a larger [ORG NATO  ] enterprise. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Miraillet  ] conveyed that [LOC France  ] was pleased with the [MISC Obama  ] administration 's swift action on [ORG Missile Defense  ] and welcomed the [LOC U.S.  ] development of the [ORG PAA  ] . 
[LOC France  ] shared the [LOC U.S.  ] perception of the threat and had ideas on ways it could participate in the [MISC U.S.-proposed  ] system . 
However , [PER Miraillet  ] emphasized that [LOC France  ] needed more information before the government could endorse a [MISC NATO-PAA  ] linkage through [ORG ALTBMD  ] , and argued that the [LOC Lisbon Summit  ] may be too early for a [ORG NATO  ] decision . 
He said that [LOC France  ] wanted information on phases three and four of the [ORG PAA  ] and whether the [PER SM-3 Block  ] 2B could be perceived as a threat by the [MISC Russians  ] . 
[PER Audibert  ] added that [LOC France  ] needed much more detail on the potential costs to [ORG NATO  ] Allies before endorsing [ORG ALTBMD  ] as the [ORG C2  ] for the [ORG European Missile Defense  ] system . 
He also asked how the [ORG C2  ] relationships in the system would work in a [ORG NATO  ] context . 
[PER Audibert  ] concluded by underscoring that [MISC French  ] hesitation on accepting a [ORG NATO  ] role for [ORG European-wide Missile Defense  ] is not reluctance , but a reflection of the need for greater clarity on what was being proposed. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In response , [PER USD  ] ( P ) [PER Flournoy  ] said we would soon share additional details on [ORG C2  ] arrangements , noting that authorities would need to be delegated given the short decision time for a response . 
She and [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] pressed the importance of a political decision at [LOC Lisbon  ] to adopt territorial [ORG Missile Defense  ] as a [ORG NATO  ] mission , both to secure [MISC Turkish  ] agreement to host the forward-based radar and to demonstrate that [ORG NATO  ] was addressing real [ORG Article  ] 5 threats . 
STATE 00013750 003 OF 004 ------ [LOC Turkey  ] ------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Miraillet  ] and [PER Audibert  ] were remarkably downbeat on [LOC Turkey  ] and lamented poor [MISC French  ] bilateral relations with [MISC Turkish  ] leadership , though they believed ties were slowly improving . 
[PER Miraillet  ] believed the military leaders were no longer what they once were as the recent [MISC Ergenekon  ] scandal had weakened the influence of the Generals in [MISC Turkish  ] politics . 
[PER Miraillet  ] asserted that FM [PER Ahmet Davutoglu  ] had kept with his theory of " strategic depth , " which he had described in his previously published books , through [LOC Turkey  ] 's continued engagement with neighbors like [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Iran  ] and in [LOC Turkey  ] 's proactive approach to the [MISC Caucasus  ] and recognition of the [MISC Iraqi Kurds  ] . 
[PER Miraillet  ] , in noting that the [MISC Turkish  ] military had of late established a better relationship with the [MISC Pakistani  ] military , stated that [LOC Turkey  ] was a nuclear threshold country and that [LOC France  ] did not know if there were similar civilian nuclear cooperation linkages with [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
In highlighting [LOC Turkey  ] 's unwillingness to engage in combat in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , its improved relationships with [LOC Syria  ] and [ORG Hamas  ] , its willingness to negotiate with [LOC Iran  ] outside the [LOC P5-plus-1  ] process , and its position on selecting a new [ORG NATO  ] Secretary General at the April 2009 [LOC Strasbourg Summit  ] , [PER Miraillet  ] summed up that [LOC Turkey  ] was becoming more of a global actor , but not always a positive actor in the international system. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER USD  ] ( P ) asked whether the [ORG EU  ] was closer to identifying a way that it could signal to [LOC Turkey  ] that the door was open to a closer relationship , such as observer status in the [ORG European Defense Agency  ] . 
[PER Audibert  ] noted that President [PER Sarkozy  ] had been particularly upset with the [MISC Turkish  ] position on [PER Rasmussen  ] at [LOC Strasbourg  ] and that [PER Sarkozy  ] 's objection to [MISC Turkish  ] membership in the [ORG EU  ] was one of five pillars on his political campaign that the public still remembered . 
Further , when [LOC France  ] tried to move forward with closer [MISC NATO-EU  ] ties during its 2008 [ORG EU  ] presidency , [LOC Turkey  ] rejected every plan that was put on the table . 
For these reasons , it would be difficult for [LOC France  ] to see any opening on [ORG EU  ] membership for [LOC Turkey  ] in the near future . 
All [MISC French  ] interlocutors agreed that a " more arrogant " [LOC Turkey  ] could present a problem during [ORG NATO Strategic Concept  ] discussions this year . 
In response , [PER Flournoy  ] , [ORG Vershbow  ] and [PER Gordon  ] reiterated that by closing the door on the [LOC Turks  ] , the [ORG EU  ] was creating a vicious circle that fueled [MISC Turkish  ] obstructionism at [LOC NATO.  ] ------ [LOC Russia  ] ------ <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Audibert  ] began by stating that [LOC France  ] was taking pragmatic approach to [LOC Russia  ] , but that President [PER Sarkozy  ] had a " problem of confidence " and did not fully trust [LOC Russia  ] . 
[PER Audibert  ] said [LOC Russia  ] 's two treaty proposals on new [ORG European Security Architecture  ] were unacceptable and mere provocations , but that the [MISC French  ] position was to use the proposals to engage the [MISC Russians  ] on new approaches to crisis management , the Conventional Forces in [LOC Europe  ] ( [LOC CFE  ] ) treaty , and on the adoption of the [ORG Open Skies/verification  ] measures . 
However , he noted , these issues will continually be bogged down over the situation in [LOC Georgia  ] , which [PER Audibert  ] saw as intractable as [LOC Russia  ] will never " derecognize " the sovereignty of [LOC Abkhazia  ] and [LOC South Ossetia  ] while also never recognizing [MISC Georgian  ] sovereignty over its territory , including the two enclaves. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Audibert  ] , noting he was raising his " if-raised " point , brought up the issue of [LOC France  ] 's potential sale of a helicopter carrier Mistral-class ship to [LOC Russia  ] . 
He asserted that the [MISC French  ] had merely agreed to negotiate with [LOC Russia  ] on the potential sale , but then argued that sale would be only for the ship without armament systems . 
[PER Audibert  ] also said that while [LOC France  ] understood [LOC U.S.  ] concerns over the potential for [LOC Russia  ] to use the ship for projection of power , it was important to note that any decision on the issue would , in the end , be political in nature . 
[PER Miraillet  ] stated that this sale would be a gesture of good will to [LOC Russia  ] as [LOC France  ] assessed the [MISC Russian  ] [ORG Navy  ] was in dire condition . 
In any case , concluded [PER Miraillet  ] , if [LOC France  ] did not make the sale , the [LOC Netherlands  ] and [LOC Spain  ] would likely sell similar technology. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) On [PER Mistral  ] , [PER USD  ] ( P ) observed the optics and policy behind the sale were perplexing as it would " fly in the face " STATE 00013750 004 OF 004 of President [PER Sarkozy  ] 's personal engagement on resolving the [LOC Georgia  ] crisis in 2008 . 
She asserted that this sale would send a confusing political signal to [LOC Russia  ] as well as to other [MISC Europeans  ] . 
[PER U/S Burns  ] concurred with [PER USD  ] ( P ) , noting the sale would feed [LOC Georgia  ] 's fears and could lead to an arms race , increasing the chance of miscalculation by one or both sides . 
[PER USD  ] ( P ) concluded that while we understood that [LOC France  ] wanted to actively engage [LOC Russia  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] would prefer that [LOC France  ] find a different confidence-building measure than a [PER Mistral  ] sale. ---- [LOC Iran  ] ---- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER U/S Burns  ] stated that the international community had reached a point where it had to begin looking for further consequences for [LOC Iran  ] as the credibility of our efforts was at stake . 
[PER U/S Burns  ] noted that other actors were watching [MISC Western  ] actions on [LOC Iran  ] . 
He cautioned that moving [LOC China  ] toward greater sanctions would not be easy , but that we need to continue engaging them. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Audibert  ] noted that [LOC France  ] was using every means possible to bring the [ORG EU  ] together on [LOC Iran  ] . 
He noted a recently [ORG EU Council  ] decision to task Foreign Ministers with developing new ideas on the way forward with [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Briens  ] stated that since the [MISC Iranian  ] regime cracked down following the June 2009 elections , the [ORG EU  ] was more solid as a block on sanctions . 
In particular , [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC Sweden  ] , who were reluctant to support sanctions in the past , were more supportive because of recent gross human rights violations. ------------------------- [LOC Middle East Peace Process  ] ------------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Audibert  ] hailed [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to reestablish peace talks between [LOC Israel  ] and the [MISC Palestinians  ] . 
He asked pointedly where the [LOC U.S.  ] saw the process in the next six months , and how to further involve [LOC Europe  ] , especially regarding a possible settlement . 
Notably , the [MISC French  ] did not advocate for a [LOC Middle East  ] summit in [LOC Paris.  ] <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( U ) [ORG Participants: United States: Department of State  ] [PER William Burns  ] , Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs [PER Phil Gordon  ] , Assistant Secretary of State for [MISC European  ] and [ORG Eurasian Affairs  ] [PER Paul Jones  ] , Deputy Special Representative for [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] [PER Maureen Cormack  ] , Director for [MISC Western  ] [ORG Europe Tamir Waser , Special Assistant  ] to [PER U/S Burns Andrew Lorenz  ] , [ORG Senior France Desk Officer Department of Defense  ] [PER Michele Flournoy  ] , Under Secretary of [ORG Defense  ] for Policy [PER Alexander Vershbow  ] , Assistant Secretary of [ORG Defense  ] for [ORG International Security Affairs  ] [PER Jim Townsend  ] , Deputy Assistant Secretary of [ORG Defense  ] for [MISC European  ] and [ORG NATO  ] Policy [PER Andrew Winternitz  ] , Deputy Director for [MISC European  ] Policy [ORG France: Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] [PER Jacques Audibert  ] , Under Secretary for Political and [ORG Strategic Affairs  ] [PER Martin Briens  ] , Deputy Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Nonproliferation [PER Nicolas Roche  ] , Political Counselor , Embassy of [ORG France Ministry of Defense  ] [PER Michel Miraillet  ] , Director for [ORG Strategic Affairs  ] Gen [PER Gratien Maire  ] , [MISC French  ] [ORG Defense  ] Attache to the [LOC U.S.  ] Gen [PER Emmanuel de Romemont  ] , Deputy Director for Disarmament and [ORG Proliferation  ] Col [PER Cyrille Claver  ] , Deputy Director for [MISC European  ] and [ORG NATO Affairs  ] Col [PER Frederic Pesme  ] , Director for [LOC North America  ] 18.This cable was cleared by [PER U/S Burns  ] and [PER USD  ] ( P ) [PER Flournoy  ] .
