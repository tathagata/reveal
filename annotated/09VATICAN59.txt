REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: The [LOC Holy See  ] welcomes President Obama’s new outreach to [LOC Cuba  ] and hopes for further steps soon , perhaps to include prison visits for the wives of the [MISC Cuban  ] Five . 
Better U.S.-Cuba ties would deprive [PER Hugo Chavez  ] of one of his favorite screeds and could help restrain him in the region , according to a [LOC Vatican  ] official . 
This is highly desirable for the [LOC Vatican  ] , which is very concerned about the deterioration of Church-state relations in [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
To avoid similar downward spirals elsewhere , the [LOC Vatican  ] said Church leaders elsewhere in [LOC Latin America  ] are reaching out to leftist governments . 
The recent attack on a [MISC Cardinal’s  ] home in [LOC Bolivia  ] may have been intended to derail such quiet rapprochement . 
End Summary . 
[ORG Cuba: Great News  ] . 
What Will You Do Next ? ---------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG CDA  ] and Acting DCM on April 22 called on the [ORG Holy See’s  ] official in charge of relations with [LOC Caribbean  ] and [MISC Andean  ] countries , Msgr. [PER Angelo Accattino  ] , to review recent developments in the region . 
As he had done previously ( ref c ) , [PER Accattino  ] warmly welcomed recent [LOC White House  ] policy decisions on [LOC Cuba  ] and reviewed with interest the [LOC White House  ] Fact Sheet on “Reaching Out to the [MISC Cuban  ] People” which [ORG CDA  ] gave him . 
[PER Accattino  ] also noted favorably [PER Raul Castro’s  ] comments that [LOC Cuba  ] was prepared to talk to the [LOC U.S.  ] about all topics - although “after all , he has no other options anymore.” [ORG CDA  ] said [ORG Castro  ] would need to reciprocate the moves from [LOC Washington  ] with more than words - he needed to take action on political prisoners or reduce the cost of receiving remittances in [LOC Cuba.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Accattino  ] said the [LOC Vatican  ] considered intriguing the possibility of a swap of political prisoners in [LOC Cuba  ] for the “Cuban Five” in jail in the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC ADCM  ] protested that their circumstances were not parallel , as the [MISC Cuban  ] Five were convicted spies and the prisoners in [LOC Cuba  ] were dissidents . 
[PER Accattino  ] quickly agreed but said discussions that led to the release of the dissidents were worth pursuing regardless . 
The [LOC Holy See  ] was also following the [ORG Supreme Court  ] appeal by the [MISC Cuban  ] Five , to see how that might affect relations between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] . 
As an interim measure , [PER Accattino  ] suggested that the [LOC U.S.  ] allow a jail visit by the wives of two of the five [MISC Cuban  ] spies . 
[ORG CDA  ] again noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] had taken the first step , now the [MISC Cuban  ] government needed to reciprocate in a concrete way . 
[PER Venezuela: Chavez  ] is Worried . 
So is the Church. --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [LOC Cuba  ] debate , [PER Accattino  ] said , had cast a long shadow at the recent [MISC Summit of the Americas  ] . 
Venezuela’s [PER Hugo Chavez  ] was clearly rattled by the thought that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] could enter into a dialogue that excluded him , and this motivated his “little scene” at the [LOC Summit. “Chavez  ] is not dumb , ” and he was playing to the other hemispheric leaders with his bombastic approach to President [PER Obama  ] . 
The [LOC Holy See  ] believes that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] should pursue a dialogue both for its own sake and/and in order to reduce the influence of [PER Chavez  ] and break up his cabal in [LOC Latin America  ] , [PER Accattino  ] said. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The situation for civil society in [LOC Venezuela  ] is getting worse every day , according to [PER Accattino  ] . 
The asylum request by [LOC Maracaibo Mayor  ] [PER Manuel Rosales  ] in [LOC Peru  ] was only the latest sign of the narrowing political space in [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
( Asked for updates on the whereabouts or situation of the [MISC Venezuelan  ] asylum seeker [PER Nixon Moreno  ] from the [LOC Nunciature  ] in [LOC Caracas  ] , however , [PER Accattino  ] answered a bit evasively . 
) The real concern , [PER Accattino  ] said , is that [LOC Venezuela  ] is turning into [LOC Cuba  ] , while [LOC Cuba  ] may be ready to open up. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Church-state relations are also deteriorating daily in [LOC Venezuela  ] , [PER Accattino  ] said . 
The [MISC Venezuelan Catholic Conference of Bishops  ] ( [ORG CEV  ] ) did not check in with [LOC Rome  ] before taking actions or making statements like its highly critical April 6 communique ( ref A ) . 
The [LOC Holy See  ] agreed with the [ORG CEV  ] conclusions , and would defend them -- even when it believed “a less confrontational approach would be more effective.” [MISC Bolivia: No More Venezuelas  ] , [PER Let’s Talk  ] . 
But Who [MISC Attacked Our Cardinal  ] ? --------------------------------------------- -------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Turning to the recent dynamite attack against the residence of Cardinal Terrazas on April 15 in [LOC Bolivia  ] , [PER Accattino  ] said it had worried the [LOC Holy See  ] greatly . 
There was property damage , but thankfully no-one was hurt . 
It could easily have been worse . 
The [LOC Vatican  ] is reserving judgment , pending the government’s investigation , on who was behind the attack . 
It could have been radicals inside the government who want to derail the recent rapprochement between the Church and the state . 
The extreme right also could have been responsible - trying to make it seem like the government did it - for the same reason . 
[PER Accattino  ] said the [LOC Holy See  ] considers either explanation equally plausible at this point . 
Meanwhile , it will keep talking to the government , because it has no choice . 
Comment: Looking Out for the Church First ----------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The [LOC Holy See  ] has consistently maintained that improving U.S.-Cuba ties would greatly reduce the appeal of [PER Hugo Chavez  ] . 
It is so alarmed by the continued downward spiral in its own relations with [PER Chavez  ] , in fact , that [PER Accattino  ] said Church leaders in [MISC Latin American  ] countries with leftist governments are rethinking their approach . 
Many episcopal ( bishops ) conferences in the region had in the past been willing to criticize excesses of these governments in an effort to protect civil society . 
They may be pulling back from that activism and advocacy in the short term , in order to protect their longer-term ability to minister to the [MISC Catholic  ] faithful without interference . 
That attitude is what is behind the Church’s moves to improve relations with the [ORG Morales  ] government in [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
It may also explain [MISC Accattino’s  ] ever-so-mild tone of criticism when discussing [ORG CEV  ] decisions in [LOC Caracas  ] . 
As for [MISC Accattino’s  ] polite unwillingness to discuss the [PER Nixon Moreno  ] case , that may also be telling , given his considerable interest in the topic last time we spoke ( ref c ) .
