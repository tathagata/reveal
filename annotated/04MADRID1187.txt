Robert Manzanares  ] per 1.5 ( b ) and ( d ) . 
Summary <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Political pressure is high on incoming Socialist President [PER Rodriguez Zapatero  ] to fulfill his campaign promise to pull the 1300 [MISC Spanish  ] troops out of [LOC Iraq  ] absent a new [ORG UN  ] mandate giving the [ORG UN  ] the lead role . 
[PER Zapatero  ] is on the hook to demonstrate to his supporters that his surprise election March 14 ushered in a significant change from the [ORG Aznar  ] years . 
[PER Zapatero  ] , who vehemently opposed the [LOC Iraq  ] war , has repeatedly emphasized , publicly and privately , that he will comply with his campaign promises . 
The clearest way to manifest this would be to pull the troops out . 
Nonetheless , the [ORG Socialists  ] are sensitive to charges a [MISC Spanish  ] withdrawal following the March 11 Madrid terror attacks would appear to be cutting and running in the face of terror . 
A new [ORG UNSCR  ] giving the [ORG UN  ] a lead role might provide [PER Zapatero  ] with cover to keep the troops in , but what exactly [PER Zapatero  ] can accept remains vague since he has not defined it . 
We expect him to take his cues from [LOC France  ] and [LOC Germany  ] . 
Public opinion in the wake of March 11 regards [LOC Spain  ] as being in the line of Jihadist fire because of the [ORG Aznar  ] government 's [LOC Iraq  ] policy and favors withdrawal . 
Recent fighting in [LOC Najaf  ] between [MISC Spanish  ] forces and Shiite extremists has heightened concerns about the [LOC Iraq  ] deployment . 
Significant [MISC Spanish  ] losses there could clinch the decision to pull out . 
End Summary . 
The Case for Withdrawal <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Zapatero  ] has been vehemently against the [LOC Iraq  ] war from the beginning . 
He has consistently maintained that the war was founded on lies , and is immoral and illegal . 
Many of the 11 million [MISC Spaniards  ] who voted for the [ORG Socialists  ] on March 14 share his view . 
Many [ORG Socialists  ] , especially those on the left , want the troops out now regardless of a [ORG UN  ] resolution . 
As far as [MISC Spanish  ] opinion as a whole , according to a radio ( [PER Cadena Ser  ] ) poll last week , 38% of respondents favored [MISC Spanish  ] troops staying in [LOC Iraq  ] if there were a new [ORG UN  ] mandate while 42% favor pulling the troops out even if the [ORG UN  ] takes control of [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Only a small percentage favor the troops staying under the current mandate . 
Many [ORG Socialists  ] are uncomfortable with the assertive international role for [LOC Spain  ] that [ORG Aznar  ] espoused and , since the March 11 attacks , believe [ORG Aznar  ] 's alliance with the [LOC US  ] put [LOC Spain  ] in the direct line of fire for [MISC Islamist  ] terrorists . 
Caving in to Terrorists ? <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [ORG Socialists  ] are , however , sensitive to the charge that withdrawal from [LOC Iraq  ] means caving in to terrorist blackmail following March 11 . 
They note that [PER Zapatero  ] 's pledge to withdraw long predated March 11 ( though the [ORG Socialists  ] would not have been elected had the March 11 attacks not taken place ) . 
[PER Jose Blanco  ] , [ORG Socialist Party National Coordinator  ] , noted on April 6: " Let 's not mix apples and oranges . 
One thing is terrorism which has to be fought on all fronts . 
Another thing is our politics concerning the war in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Politically we shouldn't link one thing with the other . 
" Popular sentiment , however , does link them . 
Many believe [LOC Spain  ] is now exposed to jihadist terrorism as a result of a military deployment in [LOC Iraq  ] that most [MISC Spaniards  ] oppose. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG Antiterrorism  ] marchers numbering 25,000 turned out April 5 in [LOC Leganes  ] , the site of the April 3 shootout and suicide of the suspected leaders of the March 11 Madrid terror attacks . 
The march underlined that many [MISC Spaniards  ] do link the March 11 terror attacks to [LOC Spain  ] 's presence in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The communique for the march , at the urging of the Socialist mayor of [LOC Leganes  ] , included an explicit call for [LOC Spain  ] to withdraw its troops from [LOC Iraq  ] . 
( This prompted [ORG Aznar  ] 's [ORG Popular Party  ] to boycott the march and organize its own on April 6 ) . 
The message that came out of the April 5 rally was that since [MISC Spaniards  ] never wanted to be in [LOC Iraq  ] in the first place , [LOC Spain  ] should withdraw , lower its profile , and thereby remove itself as a target . 
Images of the Shiite riots in [LOC Najaf  ] and elsewhere further agitated [MISC Spanish  ] opinion against [LOC Spain  ] 's presence in [LOC Iraq  ] , as did reports that [MISC Spanish  ] troops returned fire on rioters in [LOC Najaf  ] April 4 , killing about 20 . 
[ORG UN  ] Resolution Giving [ORG UN  ] a Lead Role <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) FM designate [PER Moratinos  ] has been in the lead in holding up the possibility that a new [ORG UNSCR  ] giving the [ORG UN  ] the leading role in the [LOC Iraq  ] could satisfy [PER Zapatero  ] 's electoral pledge . 
However , [PER Zapatero  ] and his key political advisors such as [PER Jose Blanco  ] and [PER Jesus Caldera  ] , have been less forward leaning than [PER Moratinos  ] . 
The posture of [LOC France  ] and [LOC Germany  ] on a new resolution should be important , since [PER Zapatero  ] has made it clear that he wants to follow their lead . 
If [LOC France  ] and [LOC Germany  ] are on board , [PER Zapatero  ] will feel pressure to follow suit . 
One prominent commentator , well connected in the [LOC PSOE  ] , noted to us that if , for example , [LOC France  ] were willing to commit troops to [LOC Iraq  ] under a new [ORG UNSCR  ] , [PER Zapatero  ] would be able to show that the situation had fundamentally changed and keep [MISC Spanish  ] troops there . 
Comment <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Indications are that [PER Zapatero  ] has not made a final decision on what to do about the troops . 
The " pull the troops out " sentiment from his base , and which his key political advisors share , will be a critical factor weighing on him . 
For [PER Zapatero  ] , the easiest scenario would be no new [ORG UN  ] resolution , which would mean he would have no choice but to pull the troops out . 
A [ORG UN  ] resolution expanding the [ORG UN  ] role will force him to make a choice . 
In this case , [PER Zapatero  ] 's allies in the all important [ORG Prisa  ] media group might be able to help him sell the line that he had won by successfully pushing for an increased [ORG UN  ] role and give him cover to keep the troops in . 
[PER Zapatero  ] may also be susceptible to the argument that , whatever the rationale or lack thereof for the war , undercutting the coalition now could prove disastrous . 
Nonetheless , escalation of fighting in [MISC Southern  ] [LOC Iraq  ] , particularly if [MISC Spanish  ] forces suffer significant losses , may clinch the decision in favor of withdrawal .
