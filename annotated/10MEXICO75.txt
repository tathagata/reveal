( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: Two recent decisions by the [ORG Inter-American Court  ] have forced international attention on perennial human rights problems in [LOC Mexico  ] and put pressure on the [ORG GOM  ] and its official human rights ombudsman to respond to criticism of its military justice system and its handling of gender violence . 
The first case , known as the [ORG Cotton Field  ] case , deals with longstanding issues of violence against women in [LOC Chihuahua  ] state . 
Reftel reviews the [LOC Radilla  ] case which calls on [LOC Mexico  ] to address inconsistencies between [LOC Mexico  ] 's constitution and the military 's code of justice . 
End Summary <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In the [ORG Cotton Field  ] case , the [ORG Court  ] considered the violent murders of three young women from [LOC Ciudad Juarez  ] , [LOC Chihuahua  ] whose bodies were discovered in a local cotton field . 
The [ORG Court  ] ruled [LOC Mexico  ] had not done enough to investigate their deaths and had fabricated evidence to falsely convict two men . 
In light of the long pattern of violence against women in the northern border area , the [ORG Court  ] found [LOC Mexico  ] had violated the human rights of the female victims and their families . 
The [ORG Court  ] ordered the [ORG GOM  ] to strengthen its investigation of such cases and make symbolic gestures to the families and victims . 
With its condemnation of widespread gender violence in [LOC Ciudad Juarez  ] , the [ORG Inter-American Court  ] forces [LOC Mexico  ] to recognize its failure to meet its human rights obligations . 
The decision is hardly a panacea for all of [LOC Mexico  ] 's human rights woes , but it should create space to address more effectively such challenges in the future . 
End summary . 
Background: The Case behind the Decision --------------------------------------------- ------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Since 1993 , NGOs and human rights groups have reported an increase in disappearances and murders of young women in [LOC Ciudad Juarez  ] . 
In 2007 , the [ORG Inter-American Court  ] considered the situation in [LOC Juarez  ] for the first time . 
The case before the [ORG Court  ] centered on three young women who were kidnapped and murdered within a month of each other . 
[PER Laura Berenice Ramos Monarrez  ] , a 17 year old high school student , was last heard from on September 22 , 2001 when she called a friend to make plans for a party . 
[PER Claudia Ivette Gonzalez  ] was 20 and an employee at a local " maquiladora . 
" When she arrived late to work on October 10 , 2001 , management refused to allow her to enter the factory and she disappeared later that day . 
[PER Esmeralda Herrera  ] Monreal was 15 and worked as a maid in the house of a local family . 
After leaving work on October 29 , 2001 , she disappeared . 
On November 6 , 2001 the bodies of these three women , along with five others , were found in a cotton field in [LOC Ciudad Juarez  ] . 
All of the women were between the ages of 15 and 20 and showed signs of rape and abuse. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In March 2002 , the victims' families , in coalition with a number of national and international NGOs , presented their case to the [ORG Inter-American Commission  ] on [ORG Human Rights  ] . 
In April 2007 , the [ORG Commission  ] issued a number of recommendations to the [ORG GOM  ] . 
The [ORG Commission  ] subsequently determined [LOC Mexico  ] had not done enough to address its concerns and submitted the case to the [ORG Court  ] in December 2007 . 
During the trial , the families of the victims presented evidence that established that the [ORG GOM  ] had neglected to conduct a thorough investigation into the victims' cases and had convicted innocent men . 
They claimed their daughters' human rights had been violated and that [LOC Mexico  ] had allowed femnicide to occur with impunity . 
The Decision ----------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Court  ] extensively discussed various aspects of gender violence in northern [LOC Mexico  ] and recognized 379 cases from 1993 to 2005 as instances of violence against women , most of which have not been solved . 
In its decision the [ORG Court  ] ruled that , " ...The State had an obligation to ensure the victims were found as quickly as possible...the [ORG Court  ] finds that the state 's evidence did not prove efforts were made to quickly launch a search , mobilize institutions and mechanisms to obtain information...or carry out an effective investigation and prosecute those responsible... . 
The insufficient answers and indifferent attitudes of authorities in the investigation of these crimes , seem to have allowed the perpetual violence against women in [LOC Ciudad Juarez  ] . 
" The [ORG Court  ] found that the victims in the [ORG Cotton Field Case  ] were victims of gender violence based on the circumstances of their disappearances and evidence of abuse and rape , as well their ages , occupations , and social classes , which were consistent with local patterns of violence . 
In its decision the [ORG Court  ] concluded , " The [ORG Tribunal  ] considers the present case of violence against women a form of discrimination and declares the State violated the right to non discrimination contained in [ORG Article  ] 1 of the [MISC American Convention  ] . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Court  ] ordered [LOC Mexico  ] to fully investigate and prosecute the murders of [PER Herrera  ] , [PER Gonzalez  ] , and [PER Ramos  ] , and within a reasonable time frame , investigate and punish the public officials responsible for the irregularities in the case . 
( Note: During his nomination last year , [MISC Mexican  ] Attorney General [PER Arturo Chavez Chavez  ] was criticized for his failure to address violence against women while he served as Attorney General of [LOC Chihuahua  ] from 1996-1998 . 
This criticism did not widely resurface in the press reporting on this decision . 
End note . 
) It also ruled the [ORG GOM  ] must standardize and improve its response to cases of disappearances and violence against women and present a yearly update on these efforts . 
Moreover , it ordered the [ORG GOM  ] to publicly acknowledge the victims in this case and other victims of gender violence by building a monument commemorating the victims , hosting a public ceremony in the victims' honor , publishing the decision in the " [ORG Diario Oficial  ] " and a national newspaper , and paying restitution to the families . 
Finally , it ordered the creation of a database of victims to aid in tracking cases and a website the public can use to report missing persons . 
Implementation: [ORG GOM  ] Will Rely on [LOC Chihuahua  ] --------------------------------------------- ---------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Although the [ORG Court  ] 's decision obligates [LOC Mexico  ] to improve its response to crimes against women , there has been no official public reaction from the [ORG GOM  ] on the practical steps it plans to take to implement the [ORG Court  ] 's decision . 
According to [ORG POL  ] sources , the [ORG GOM  ] will look to the state of [LOC Chihuahua  ] to assume the lead on implementing the prescribed actions . 
[PER Jose Guevara  ] , Director of the Unit for the [ORG Promotion and Protection of Human Rights  ] at the [ORG Secretariat of the Interior  ] ( [ORG SEGOB  ] ) , the office responsible for implementing [ORG Inter-American Court  ] decisions , told [LOC Poloffs  ] that [LOC Chihuahua  ] will have to implement some procedural changes but indicated it should not be difficult to do so within the [ORG Court  ] 's one year deadline . 
Comment -------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Both cases before the [ORG Inter-American Court  ] were the result of a dedicated effort by the families of victims , supported by civil society groups , to seek justice . 
There was no significant backing from the [ORG CNDH  ] and the [MISC Mexican  ] government resisted with counter arguments . 
The decisions have put new pressure on the [ORG GOM  ] , the military and the [ORG CNDH  ] to take or support remedial action . 
The [ORG CNDH  ] , while helpful in documenting abuse , has often shied away from using the existing authority in its mandate to support victims and their families . 
The Ambassador is scheduled to meet with the new [ORG CNDH  ] President , [PER Raul Plasencia  ] , to discuss ways to reinforce [ORG CNDH  ] efforts in line with the our comprehensive strategy on human rights ( ref B ) . 
In our working ongoing dialogue with the [MISC Mexican  ] human rights community , several NGO 's have focused on the [ORG CNDH  ] and its new leadership as an area where much more can be done .
