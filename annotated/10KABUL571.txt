Mussomeli  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG C//REL ISAF  ] ) Summary: The first [ORG Nexus-Corruption Leadership Board  ] , co-chaired by Coordinating Director for Development and [ORG Economic Affairs  ] , Ambassador [PER Wayne  ] , and [ORG ISAF J2  ] ( [ORG Intel  ] ) , Major General [PER Flynn  ] , met on February 4 to consider possible courses of action ( “COAs” ) that [LOC U.S.  ] military and Embassy personnel may employ against criminal and corrupt [MISC Afghan  ] officials in an effort to change their behavior . 
These recommendations were developed through the joint effort of the [ORG Embassy’s Nexus-Corruption Coordination  ] committee ( [ORG NCC  ] ) and [ORG ISAF’s Anti-Corruption Task Force  ] ( [ORG ACTF  ] ) . 
The [ORG Leadership Board  ] approved three recommendations: ( 1 ) to apply a set of minimum COAs against high-profile corrupt officials to signal a change in [LOC U.S.  ] policy on corruption ; ( 2 ) to begin a series of high-level demarches to persuade the [PER Karzai  ] government to follow through on promises to tackle corruption ; and ( 3 ) to consider at the next [ORG Leadership Board  ] meeting recommendations on applying appropriate [MISC COAs  ] , including possible law enforcement actions , against three prominent [MISC Afghan  ] malign actors in southern Afghanistan: [PER Abdul Razziq  ] , [PER Ahmed Wali Karzai  ] , [PER Asadullah Sherzad  ] . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG C//REL ISAF  ] ) The purpose of the [ORG NCC  ] is to develop policy recommendations on ways to reduce and combat official corruption and “nexus” criminal activities ( i.e. , insurgency , narcotics and criminality ) . 
The membership of the [ORG NCC  ] includes representatives from [LOC U.S.  ] law enforcement agencies , [ORG U.S. Treasury  ] , and a cleared [MISC American  ] from [ORG ISAF  ] . 
[ORG ISAF’s ACTF  ] works in partnership with the [ORG NCC  ] and the international community ( e.g. , the [LOC UK  ] and the [ORG UN  ] ) to develop policy goals , prioritize policy towards important malign actors ( i.e. , corrupt/criminal [MISC Afghan  ] officials ) , and determine appropriate courses of action to change their behavior . 
[ORG Board Considers Courses of Action  ] ( [ORG COA  ] ) Policy --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG C//REL ISAF  ] ) In the first meeting of the [ORG Leadership Board  ] , co-chairs Ambassador [PER Wayne  ] and [ORG MG Flynn  ] approved the concept of applying non-law enforcement COAs to corrupt officials on a case-by-case basis . 
Possible COAs can run the spectrum from refusing to appear in a picture with a corrupt official , to cutting off [ORG USG  ] funded assistance , to seizing ill-gotten assets , to applying [MISC Presidential Proclamation  ] 7750 , which prevents the corrupt official and his/her family from obtaining [LOC U.S.  ] visas . 
No COAs are intended to preclude or replace prosecutions when appropriate , but to serve as tools to be considered to alter illicit behavior in addition to prosecution , or when prosecution is not possible or has a low likelihood of success . 
The policy also provides that no [ORG COA  ] is recommended that will hinder , prevent , or interfere with an ongoing criminal investigation or prosecution . 
However , in many cases , the proposed measure may be as or more effective than law enforcement actions in influencing the conduct of officials involved in corruption or nexus-related activities , particularly at the local level. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG C//REL ISAF  ] ) Ambassador [PER Wayne  ] and [ORG MG Flynn  ] also agreed to the recommendation to develop a “basket” of minimum [MISC COAs  ] that would be applied as a default to all corrupt officials that are prioritized as persons of interest by [ORG NCC  ] and/or [ORG ACTF  ] . 
These minimum [MISC COAs  ] include: ( 1 ) no public meetings with the official ( and no photos ) , and no high-profile public visits from CODELs and other dignitaries ; ( 2 ) no giving or receiving of gifts ; and ( 3 ) restrictions on opportunities for corrupt officials to participate in [MISC U.S.-funded  ] training , travel , and speaking engagements . 
Applying minimum COAs is designed to help change perceptions held by parts of the [MISC Afghan  ] public that the [LOC U.S.  ] supports , explicitly or implicitly , known corrupt officials . 
Positive Incentives for Positive Acts ------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG C//REL ISAF  ] ) The [ORG COA  ] policy approved by the [ORG Leadership Board  ] also provides for positive incentives for [MISC Afghan  ] officials who have demonstrated that they are not corrupt , who facilitate [LOC U.S.  ] efforts and are positive influences in a given province or district . 
Examples of positive courses of action include recognition for a notable activity , project funding , consideration for training opportunities , media opportunities , etc . 
[ORG Board Will Consider Application of COAs  ] at Next Meeting ------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG C//REL ISAF  ] ) The meeting decided that [ORG ACTF  ] and [ORG NCC  ] will meet prior to the next [ORG Leadership Board  ] meeting ( convened monthly ) to consider intel and law enforcement files assembled on three powerful officials operating in the south of the country who are believed to be corrupt: ABP Commander at [LOC Weesh Chaman  ] border crossing Colonel [PER Abdul Razziq  ] , [PER Ahmed Wali Karzai  ] , and Chief of Police [PER Asadullah Sherzad  ] . 
[ORG ACTF  ] and [ORG NCC  ] will make a joint policy recommendation on how these officials should be addressed , taking into consideration second and third order effects and the input of military and civilian experts in the field . 
Ambassador [PER Wayne  ] and [ORG MG Flynn  ] will review the [LOC KABUL  ] 00000571 002 OF 002 recommendations at the next [ORG Leadership Board  ] meeting , and their decision will be reported septel . 
They will also consider recommendations on a series of high-level demarches intended to encourage President [PER Karzai  ] to honor his public commitment to fight corruption . 
( [ORG Note: Work  ] on formulating these recommendations is underway . 
End Note ) Background: [ORG NCC  ] , the [ORG ACTF  ] , and the [ORG Leadership Board  ] --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG C//REL ISAF  ] ) The [ORG NCC  ] learns of corrupt and criminal actions through regular field reporting , law enforcement and intel activities , policy meetings , and from international partners . 
The [ORG National Level Civ-Mil Anti-Corruption  ] , [ORG Counternarcotics  ] , and Illicit Finance Working Groups also refer information to , receive referrals from , and coordinate actions with the [ORG NCC  ] . 
When incriminating information is obtained about an [MISC Afghan  ] official of national prominence , or whose actions have a destabilizing effect on the [LOC U.S.  ] mission , the [ORG NCC  ] considers possible COAs in cooperation with [ORG ISAF’s ACTF  ] . 
[ORG NCC  ] members include working level representatives from [ORG FBI  ] , [ORG DEA  ] , [ORG DOJ  ] , [ORG POL  ] , [ORG SIGAR  ] , [MISC Afghan  ] Threat Finance Cell ( [ORG AFTC  ] ) , [ORG RAO  ] , and [ORG Treasury  ] , as well as other [LOC U.S.  ] agencies . 
Cleared [MISC Americans  ] from [ORG ISAF  ] , [ORG IJC  ] J2 , [MISC CJIATF-NEXUS  ] and targeting staff are also invited to participate. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG C//REL ISAF  ] ) As described above , the [ORG NCC  ] will make recommendations to the [ORG Leadership Board  ] , comprised of [MISC General-level  ] officers from the [ORG Embassy  ] and [ORG ISAF  ] . 
Currently , the [ORG Leadership Board  ] meetings are co-chaired by CDDEA Ambassador [PER Wayne  ] or Deputy Ambassador [PER Ricciardone  ] and [ORG ISAF  ] J2 [ORG MG Flynn  ] . 
The [ORG Leadership Board  ] will review recommendations on nexus-related or corruption issues involving situations that could negatively impact the [LOC U.S.  ] relationship with key government officials or ministries . 
At its discretion , the [ORG Leadership Board  ] may forward a case up to the [ORG Leadership Team  ] , consisting of the [LOC U.S.  ] Ambassador and the Commander , [LOC U.S.  ] Forces-Afghanistan/Commander [ORG ISAF  ] , or their designated representatives . 
The [ORG Leadership Team  ] will review any nexus-corruption report involving a prominent official or having implications that would negatively impact the [LOC U.S.  ] relationship with key government officials or ministries . 
At any time , the [ORG Leadership Team  ] may convene meetings to discuss sensitive cases or to review [ORG Leadership Board  ] decisions and recommendations as part of the weekly Principals Meeting . 
Comment ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG C//REL ISAF  ] ) Recognizing the major limitations of law enforcement actions in [LOC Afghanistan  ] at this time ( due to lack of capacity and lack of political will ) , this civ-mil effort will use pragmatic courses of action to end tacit [MISC American  ] support for corrupt [MISC Afghan  ] officials and to attempt to change the illicit behavior of officials and influential [MISC Afghans  ] . 
Given the fluidity of developments on the ground ( e.g. , rumors of [PER Ahmed Wali Karzai’s  ] appointment as Ambassador to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] or [LOC Oman  ] , and [PER Abdul Razziq’s  ] initiative to form an anti-corruption task force in [LOC Spin Boldak  ] ) , the time is right to determine an appropriate policy for dealing with such officials .
