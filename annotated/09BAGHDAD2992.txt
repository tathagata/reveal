( [ORG S  ] ) SUMMARY: [LOC Iran  ] is a dominant player in [LOC Iraq  ] 's electoral politics , and is using its close ties to [MISC Shia  ] , [MISC Kurdish  ] , and select [MISC Sunni  ] figures to shape the political landscape in favor of a united [MISC Shia  ] victory in the January election . 
A pro-Iran , [MISC Shia-dominated  ] , and preferably [MISC Islamist  ] government , led by a united [MISC Shia  ] alliance remains [LOC Iran  ] 's top priority . 
Toward that end , [LOC Iran  ] is seeking to increase pressure on [PER Maliki  ] to join forces with the other prominent [MISC Shia  ] coalition ( [ORG Iraqi National Alliance  ] ) led by the Sadrists and the [ORG Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq  ] ( [ORG ISCI  ] ) . 
END SUMMARY <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [LOC Iran  ] is arguably the most influential regional power seeking to shape and influence the outcome of [LOC Iraq  ] 's election . 
This message offers an assessment of [LOC Iran  ] 's efforts to shape [LOC Iraq  ] 's electoral politics in anticipation of the national election in January . 
[LOC Iran  ] 's [ORG Policy Goals and Tools  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [LOC Iran  ] 's over-arching political objective for [LOC Iraq  ] 's January election is the re-election of a [MISC Shia-dominated  ] , preferably [MISC Islamist  ] , coalition led by [LOC Tehran  ] 's closest allies , notably [ORG ISCI  ] and the [ORG Sadrist Trend  ] under the rubric of the [ORG Iraqi National Alliance  ] coalition ( [ORG INA  ] ) ( reftel ) . 
[LOC Iraq  ] , given its proximity to [LOC Iran  ] and its shared [MISC Shia  ] heritage , represents a vital foreign policy priority for the [MISC Iranian  ] government 's ( [LOC IRIG  ] ) efforts to project its ideology and influence in the region . 
An economically dependent and politically subservient [LOC Iraq  ] would foster greater strategic depth for [LOC Tehran  ] . 
[MISC Iranian  ] president [PER Ahmadinejad  ] has referred to [LOC Iraq  ] in recent press statements as " a [MISC Shia  ] base " confronting the broader menace perpetrated by those opposed to [LOC Iraq  ] 's identity and stability ( i.e. , [MISC Sunni  ] states , the [LOC West  ] ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [LOC Iran  ] 's approach to its bilateral relationship with [LOC Iraq  ] ranges from political micro-management to broad strategic guidance emanating directly from Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] in [LOC Tehran  ] . 
The [LOC IRIG  ] recognizes that influence in [LOC Iraq  ] requires operational ( and at times ideological ) flexibility . 
As a result , it is not uncommon for the [LOC IRIG  ] to finance and support competing [MISC Shia  ] , [MISC Kurdish  ] , and to some extent , [MISC Sunni  ] entities , with the aim of developing the [MISC Iraqi  ] body politic 's dependency on [LOC Tehran  ] 's largesse . 
While exact figures are unknown , [LOC Tehran  ] 's financial assistance to [MISC Iraqi  ] surrogates is estimated at [MISC USD  ] 100-200 million annually , with [MISC USD  ] 70 million going to [PER ISCI/Badr  ] coffers. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Since at least 2003 , Brigadier General [PER Qasem Soleimani  ] , the commander of the [ORG Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps-Qods Force  ] ( [ORG IRGC-QF  ] ) , has been the point main directing the formulation and implementation of the [LOC IRIG  ] 's [LOC Iraq  ] policy , with authority second only to Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] . 
Through his [ORG IRGC-QF  ] officers and [MISC Iraqi  ] proxies in [LOC Iraq  ] , notably [MISC Iranian  ] Ambassador and [ORG IRGC-QF  ] associate [PER Hassan Kazemi-Qomi  ] , [PER Soleimani  ] employs the full range of diplomatic , security , intelligence , and economic tools to influence [MISC Iraqi  ] allies and detractors in order to shape a more pro-Iran regime in [LOC Baghdad  ] and the provinces. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Soleimani  ] enjoys long-standing close ties with several prominent [MISC GOI  ] officials , including President [PER Talabani  ] , [PER Vice-President Adel Abdal-Mahdi  ] ( [ORG ISCI  ] ) , Prime Minister [PER Maliki  ] ( [ORG Da'wa  ] ) , former [PER PM Jaafari  ] , and more recently , [PER Speaker Samarra'i  ] ( Septel reports [MISC Iranian  ] Speaker Qrecently , [PER Speaker Samarra'i  ] ( Septel reports [MISC Iranian  ] Speaker [PER Larijani  ] 's November 4-7 visit to [LOC Iraq  ] at [PER Samarra'i  ] 's invitation . 
) . 
[PER Khamenei  ] , President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , Speaker [PER Larijani  ] , and former president [PER Rafsanjani  ] consult regularly with visiting [MISC GOI  ] officials as part of the [ORG IRIG  ] 's broader " strategic " council of advisers seeking to influence the [ORG GOI.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [LOC Iran  ] 's tools of influence include financial support to ( and pressure on ) a cross-spectrum of [MISC Iraqi  ] parties and officials ; economic development assistance , notably to religious organizations ; lethal aid to select militant [MISC Shia  ] proxies ; and sanctuary to [MISC Iraqi  ] figures fearful of [ORG USG  ] targeting or those seeking to revitalize their political/religious credentials , most notably [PER Moqtada al-Sadr  ] . 
This leverage also extends , to a lesser extent , to select [MISC Sunni  ] actors , including such public figures as [MISC Iraqi  ] Speaker [PER Samarra'i  ] , whose September visit to [LOC Tehran  ] included [LOC BAGHDAD  ] 00002992 002 OF 003 meetings with several senior [ORG IRIG  ] officials . 
Pre-Election Jockeying ---------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Predictably , [LOC Iran  ] is actively lobbying and recruiting [MISC Iraqis  ] of various political stripes and affiliations , including [MISC Sunnis  ] , in the run-up to the election to ensure a united [MISC Shia-led  ] coalition government . 
Given the likelihood of a [MISC Shia-led  ] victory in the election , [LOC Iran  ] appears more concerned about the strength of a united [MISC Shia  ] bloc in the post-election phase of government formation . 
For [LOC Iran  ] , a " rebellious " [PER Maliki  ] pursuing a more nationalist vs. sectarian agenda risks splitting the [MISC Shia  ] vote , which in turn weakens the [MISC Shia  ] political bloc 's negotiating strength during the government formation period post-election . 
[LOC Iran  ] 's greatest fear for the upcoming election is a fractured [MISC Shia  ] coalition that is unable to coalesce and thereby dominate the next government . 
[LOC Iran  ] 's worst-case election scenario ( increasingly unrealistic ) is a coup d'etat of former regime elements hostile to [LOC Tehran.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) A weak [MISC Shia  ] coalition before or after the election would further undermine the [ORG INA  ] and their pro-Iranian entities , notably [ORG ISCI  ] and the [ORG Sadrist Trend  ] . 
The [MISC Kurds  ] , historically closer to [ORG ISCI  ] , remain the important swing vote and are unlikely to reveal their true coalition intentions until after the election . 
As seasoned masters of the [MISC Iraqi  ] political chessboard , [MISC Kurdish  ] leaders such as [PER Talabani  ] and [PER Barzani  ] will likely exploit their political strength among [PER Shia/Sunni  ] counterparts to protect and expand [MISC Kurdish  ] influence in a future government . 
[LOC Iran  ] 's historic ties to the [ORG PUK  ] , and to a lesser extent [ORG KDP  ] officials , make the [MISC Kurds  ] an important element in ensuring a pro-Iranian [MISC Shia  ] victory in the election . 
[ORG INA  ] officials are confident that the [MISC Kurds  ] will join their coalition , all but guaranteeing an election victory . 
An unknown factor in national elections is the [MISC Kurdish  ] opposition party , [PER Goran List  ] , under the leadership of former [ORG PUK  ] Secretary General [PER Nawshirwan Mustafa  ] . 
[PER Goran  ] is committed to unseating the [ORG PUK  ] ( and [PER Talabani  ] ) in [LOC Suleymaniyah  ] province but needs financial backing to ensure its long-term viability in the [ORG KRG  ] and national politics . 
[LOC Iran  ] could conceivably alleviate [PER Goran  ] 's financial woes , particularly through its close ties with the [MISC Kurdish  ] Jaff tribe , some of whom are [PER Goran  ] members . 
However , doing so would undermine the [ORG IRIG  ] 's valued relationship with [PER Talabani  ] , while also proving exceedingly duplicitous , even by [ORG IRIG  ] and [ORG KRG  ] standards. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) It is important to note that [LOC Iran  ] 's power in [LOC Iraq  ] , although extensive , is not without limitations . 
The [ORG IRIG  ] 's greatest political roadblock remains the domineering authority and religious credibility embodied in [MISC Grand Ayatollah  ] [PER Ali Sistani  ] . 
Despite his [MISC Iranian  ] heritage , [PER Sistani  ] is [LOC Iraq  ] 's most revered [MISC Shia  ] religious ( and political ) authority . 
A critic of [LOC Iran  ] 's " [MISC Velayet-e-Faqih  ] " ( rule of the jurisprudent ) system of theocratic governance , [PER Sistani  ] 's abstemious ( aka Quietest school ) approach to [MISC Shia  ] politics has kept him well above the political fray while at the same time ensuring him significant impact on those rare occasions when he pronounces on politics . 
For example , [PER Sistani  ] 's public support for an open list ballot was instrumental in prompting [ORG ISCI  ] , [ORG Sadrist Trend  ] , [PER Maliki  ] 's [ORG State of Law  ] , and other [MISC Shia  ] parties to follow suit , despite [LOC Tehran  ] 's preference for a closed list . 
Domestic political realities will continue to force [MISC Shia  ] political parties like [ORG ISCI  ] , [PER Dawa Qwill  ] continue to force [MISC Shia  ] political parties like [ORG ISCI  ] , [PER Dawa  ] and [ORG Sadr Trend  ] , with close historic ties to [LOC Iran  ] , to balance between support for a broader [MISC Iraqi-Shia  ] agenda , as championed by [PER Sistani  ] , and the alternative , championed by [LOC Iran  ] , that would subordinate [MISC Iraqi  ] interests to [LOC Iran  ] 's broader objectives ( septel ) . 
Soft vs. [ORG Hard Power  ] ------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Following the [ORG GOI  ] 's crackdown on Iranian-supported Sadrist militias in [LOC Basrah  ] during the " Charge of the [MISC Knights  ] " operation in March 2008 , [LOC Iran  ] has calibrated its operations in [LOC Iraq  ] to encompass more " soft power " ( economic , religious , educational ) support and investment as part of a broader " hearts and minds " campaign . 
( NOTE: [MISC Iranian  ] lethal aid to militant proxies continues ; however , on a less visible scale . 
END NOTE ) . 
With annual bilateral trade estimated at USD 4 billion ( up 30 percent since 2008 ) and comprised mostly of [MISC Iranian  ] imports ( approximately 48 percent of [LOC Iraq  ] 's imports are [MISC Iranian  ] goods ) , the [ORG IRIG  ] continues to jockey for economic domination in [LOC Iraq  ] through targeted development assistance , focused largely on refurbishment of [MISC Shia  ] religious shrines , [LOC BAGHDAD  ] 00002992 003 OF 003 and trade deals and bilateral agreements aimed at fostering greater [MISC Iraqi  ] economic dependency on [LOC Iran  ] . 
This measure has been successful , largely because of [LOC Iran  ] 's geographic proximity and access to [MISC Iraqi  ] markets that are otherwise financially or politically less appealing to other states , notably the [LOC United States  ] , [LOC Europe  ] , and other industrialized nations . 
[LOC Turkey  ] , on the other hand , remains [LOC Iran  ] 's biggest economic competitor , particularly in the [ORG Kurdistan Regional Government  ] ( [ORG KRG  ] ) . 
Implications for [LOC U.S.  ] Policy ---------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) COMMENT: Concerns about long-term [LOC U.S.  ] influence , albeit tempered by the withdrawal deadline , continue to inform [ORG IRIG  ] decision-making to ensure its strategic foothold in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[LOC Iran  ] views [LOC Iraq  ] as a natural ( and more junior ) strategic partner . 
As a result , [LOC Iran  ] will continue to flex its muscles to ensure it 's strategic outcomes are met . 
This should not lead to alarmist tendencies or reactions on our part . 
The next [MISC Iraqi  ] government will continue to cultivate close ties with [LOC Iran  ] given long-standing historical realities that precede [LOC Iraq  ] 's ties with the [LOC United States  ] . 
On the other hand , [LOC Iran  ] 's influence in [LOC Iraq  ] should not be overestimated . 
As the [ORG GOI  ] continues to gain its footing , points of divergence between [LOC Tehran  ] and [LOC Baghdad  ] become increasingly evident on such sensitive bilateral issues as water , hydrocarbons , maritime borders , and political parity . 
Some prominent [MISC Iraqi  ] leaders , including those with close ties to [LOC Iran  ] ( i.e. , [PER Maliki  ] , [PER Ammar al-Hakim  ] ) are increasingly sensitive to being labeled [MISC Iranian  ] lackeys. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) COMMENT CONT'D: Our objective in [LOC Iraq  ] should be less about countering all-things [MISC Iranian  ] , and more about developing viable alternatives and approaches that gradually alter the [ORG GOI  ] 's political , economic , and social worldview . 
Development of viable international alternatives in [LOC Iraq  ] is one of the most effective measures of countering [MISC Iranian  ] ambitions and , ultimately , integrating [LOC Iraq  ] as a constructive member of the international community . 
Specifically , our ongoing efforts to bolster the [ORG GOI  ] through capacity-building and assistance within the [ORG Strategic Framework Agreement  ] ( [ORG SFA  ] ) and to remove [LOC Iraq  ] from Chapter VII remain our most valuable tools in this regard . 
Given the value placed on the [ORG SFA  ] by the [ORG GOI  ] and the [MISC Iraqi  ] public , our ability to recognize , enhance , and exploit the value of the partnership will constitute an essential element of any effort to counter " malign " [MISC Iranian  ] influence .
