( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY . 
The [ORG Amazon Fund  ] created in August 2008 and funded by a [MISC US$1  ] billion pledge from [LOC Norway  ] has just announced its first block of approved projects to help monitor and reduce deforestation in [LOC Brazil  ] 's [LOC Amazon  ] region . 
[LOC Brazil  ] also has now passed a law that will establish a [ORG National Climate Change Fund  ] , which Environment Minister [PER Carlos Minc  ] says will be funded with up to [MISC Reals  ] 1 billion ( nearly [MISC US$600  ] million ) per year from 10 percent of the proceeds of oil production . 
Further , Minister [PER Minc  ] announced that he wants to create a [ORG Cerrado Fund  ] to finance forest conservation projects in [LOC Brazil  ] 's vast savannah region . 
END SUMMARY . 
[ORG AMAZON FUND  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While in [LOC Oslo  ] to receive the [MISC Nobel Peace Prize  ] , President [PER Obama  ] took time to praise the [ORG Amazon Fund  ] ( or " [LOC Fundo Amazonia  ] " ) as a model for addressing deforestation . 
The [ORG Amazon Fund  ] deserves attention because it is one of the world 's first large-scale and best financed [ORG REDD  ] ( reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation ) mechanisms . 
The [ORG Amazon Fund  ] was created by presidential decree in August 2008 ( REFTEL A ) . 
It is the Government of [LOC Brazil  ] 's ( [ORG GOB  ] ) preferred mechanism for channeling international financial support to reduce deforestation . 
The [ORG GOB  ] particularly likes that ( 1 ) [MISC Brazilians  ] - and not the donors - decide how to use the funds within certain guidelines spelled out in the decree establishing the fund , and ( 2 ) the emissions reductions resulting from the funded projects cannot be used as credits or offsets by the donors . 
To make the fund more attractive to donors , the [ORG GOB  ] agreed to only make disbursements if the rate of [LOC Amazon  ] deforestation is lower than a base line ( for now it is compared with a high initial base line figure ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In September 2008 , [LOC Norway  ] announced that it would give up to [MISC US$1  ] billion through 2015 . 
[MISC Norwegian  ] Charge [PER Inge Nordang  ] tells Post that [LOC Norway  ] is pleased with the progress made so far by the fund . 
Consequently , he said that [LOC Norway  ] has allocated 700 million [MISC Norwegian  ] [PER Krone  ] ( about [MISC US$  ] 110 million for 2009 ) , and 750 million [MISC Norwegian  ] [PER Krone  ] ( about [MISC US$  ] 125 million ) for 2010 and 2011 . 
After 2011 , [LOC Norway  ] will need to make new budget allocations . 
No other country has made a contribution to the fund , however , [MISC German  ] Charge [PER Hermann Sausen  ] says that [LOC Germany  ] is looking at making a contribution of 18 million [MISC Euros  ] in 2010 and possibly similar additional contributions in later years . 
In addition , [LOC Germany  ] plans on providing four million [MISC Euros  ] to help develop [LOC Brazil  ] 's capacity at the national , state and local levels to handle these funds. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Amazon Fund  ] has now entered the operational phase . 
On December 9 , the fund 's manager , [ORG National Bank of Social and Economic Development  ] ( [ORG BNDES  ] ) , announced that it had approved the first group of projects . 
[ORG BNDES  ] plans to distribute over the next three years a total of [MISC Reals  ] 70.3 million ( about [MISC US$  ] 40 million ) to the following five projects: - The [ORG State of Amazonas  ] ( which is about the size of [LOC Alaska  ] and contains nearly half of the [LOC Amazon Forest  ] in [LOC Brazil  ] ) operates the [ORG Sustainable Amazonas Foundation  ] ( " [ORG Fundacao Amazonas  ] Sustentavel " ) , which will receive [MISC Reals  ] 19.2 million ( about [MISC US$11  ] million ) from the [ORG Amazon Fund  ] to support a near doubling of the [ORG Forest Support Program  ] ( " [ORG Programa Bolsa Floresta  ] " ) . 
That state-level program provides funds to local communities and small monthly allotments to families living in the forests in [ORG Amazonas State  ] to preserve the forest and to develop sustainable economic alternatives to deforestation. - [ORG IMAZON  ] ( the " [ORG Amazon Institute of People  ] and the Environment " or " Instituto de [PER Homem  ] e [PER Meio Ambiente  ] da [LOC Amazonia  ] " ) will receive [MISC Reals  ] 9.7 million ( nearly [MISC US$6  ] million ) to help in monitoring deforestation and support land title registration in the [ORG State of Para  ] , which is where much of the deforestation is occurring . 
[ORG IMAZON  ] is a USAID partner . 
It has gained a well-deserved reputation for excellent analysis of satellite imagery to detect and monitor deforestation. - The [MISC Nature Conservancy-Brazil  ] ( TNC Brasil ) , also a USAID partner , will get [MISC Reals  ] 16 million ( about [MISC US$9  ] million ) for use in 12 municipalities with some of the highest rates of deforestation in the [ORG States of Para  ] and [ORG Mato Grosso  ] . 
The money will support land title registration efforts and also promote efforts to ensure that wood , soy and cattle from illegally cleared land do not enter the market. - The [ORG Green Gold Institute  ] ( " Instituto [LOC Ouro Verde  ] " ) plans to promote the recovery of 1.2 million hectares of degraded areas and support sustainable family farming in six municipalities . 
The fund will provide it with [MISC Reals  ] $5.4 million ( about [MISC US$3  ] million ) . - [ORG FUNBIO  ] ( the [ORG Brazilian Fund  ] for [ORG Biodiversity  ] ) will use the [MISC Reals  ] 20 million ( about [MISC US$12  ] million ) from the [ORG Amazon Fund  ] to support the creation of 13.5 million hectares of conservation units in the [LOC Amazon  ] , and supporting the consolidation of 32 million hectares of existing conservation units . 
NOTE: The [ORG GOB  ] intends to use [ORG FUNBIO  ] to implement a [MISC US$  ] 20 million [LOC Tropical Forest Conservation Act  ] ( [ORG TFCA  ] ) program if the terms of an agreement can be worked out with the [ORG USG  ] . 
END NOTE. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While generally satisfied with the [ORG Amazon Fund  ] , [LOC Norway  ] does emphasize one particular change it would like to see . 
[LOC Norway  ] is increasing the pressure on the [ORG GOB  ] to accept projects for monitoring and control of deforestation in other biomes in [LOC Brazil  ] and in other tropical forest countries . 
The [ORG Amazon Fund  ] 's decree specifically provides that up to 20 percent of its resources can be used for other biomes and countries . 
[LOC Norway  ] wants to see the fund support such projects , said Charge [PER Nordang  ] . 
[ORG NATIONAL FUND FOR CLIMATE CHANGE  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG GOB  ] is in the process of creating a [ORG National Fund for Climate Change  ] , financed from expected oil revenues . 
It would use the money for actions to mitigate emissions and for measures to adapt to climate change throughout [LOC Brazil  ] , not just in the [LOC Amazon  ] biome or in forests . 
On December 9 , President [PER Luis Inacio Lula da Silva  ] signed the [ORG National Climate Change Policy  ] law , which included a provision to create the fund . 
Environment Minister [PER Minc  ] said he expected this new fund to annually receive between [MISC Reals  ] 800 million and 1 billion ( about [MISC US$  ] 470 to 600 million ) , which would come from up to 10 percent of oil revenues . 
While the creation of the [ORG National Fund for Climate Change  ] has been approved , much remains to be done to bring it to life . 
Most importantly , the funding levels and mechanisms are still in question . 
The internal debate over the use of the expected revenues from exploiting the vast off shore reserves is only heating up . 
It is not clear how much , if any , of those revenues will flow into this new fund . 
[ORG CERRADO FUND  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On [ORG Decmeber  ] 3 , Environment Minister [PER Minc  ] told the press that the [ORG GOB  ] planned to replicate the [ORG Amazon Fund  ] with a similar fund for the central-western savannah region called the [LOC Cerrado  ] . 
This new [ORG Cerrado Fund  ] would combat deforestation in the [LOC Cerrado  ] and also help preserve biodiversity . 
Reducing deforestation in the [LOC Cerrado  ] has taken on greater importance for the [ORG GOB  ] because it is [LOC Brazil  ] 's second biggest mitigation action , after reducing deforestation in the [LOC Amazon  ] region . 
The [ORG GOB  ] has set a goal of lowering the rate of deforestation in the [LOC Cerrado  ] by 40 percent by 2020 , which it calculates will save about 104 million tons of [MISC CO2  ] per year . 
COMMENT <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Brazil  ] with its [ORG Amazon Fund  ] is beginning to implement large scale [ORG REDD  ] projects . 
The lessons learned from this experience should prove useful to managing the expected large infusions of international financing for [ORG REDD  ] projects in [LOC Brazil  ] and elsewhere coming out of [LOC Copenhagen  ] . 
Further , the capacity being developed at all levels - national , state and local - in handling [ORG REDD  ] projects in [LOC Brazil  ] will be beneficial to funding from the [LOC United States  ] in the future , whether through USAID , [ORG TFCA  ] , or forest offsets related to a cap-and-trade arrangement . 
It is good sign of growing maturity and independence that the [ORG GOB  ] is contemplating using some of the substantial oil revenues it expects to receive from exploiting its massive offshore oil reserves to address climate change through the new [ORG National Climate Change Fund  ] . 
Finally , a [ORG Cerrado Fund  ] could assist the [ORG GOB  ] in trying to meet one of its largest mitigation action proposed at [LOC Copenhagen  ] . 
END COMMENT .
