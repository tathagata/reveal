08 [LOC MADRID  ] 1262 [LOC MADRID  ] 00000029 001.2 OF 002 Classified By: DCM [PER Arnold A. Chacon  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) POLOFF met on January 8 with [PER Carlos Torres  ] , Counselor for [ORG Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament  ] in the MFA , s [ORG DG for Strategic Affairs & Terrorism  ] . 
[PER Torres  ] raised the issue of [LOC Spain  ] 's ongoing reservations about revisions to the [ORG Nuclear Supplier Group  ] 's ( NSG 's ) Guidelines for Transfers of [ORG Enrichment & Reprocessing Equipment  ] and Technology , as discussed in REFTELS B , C , D and [PER E. While Torres  ] said that the [ORG GOS  ] believes that [MISC Spanish  ] concerns about proposed revisions to [ORG Paragraph  ] 6 would be resolved with the inclusion of a sentiment as proposed by the [ORG GOS  ] in REFTEL B , he opined that [LOC Madrid  ] is still " far from reaching an agreement " on the current version of the revised [ORG Paragraph  ] 7 . 
He also remarked that he understood [LOC Moscow  ] and [LOC Beijing  ] were agreeable to the current draft that [LOC Madrid  ] opposes. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Torres  ] likened the existing revision of [ORG Paragraph  ] 7 to the [ORG Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  ] , which would divide countries into a before and after of have 's and have-not 's , with those who could enrich uranium and those who could not . 
He asserted that for [LOC Spain  ] -- which he described as having a vibrant , longstanding civil nuclear industry -- the issue is not a theoretical one but is a practical matter with very serious implications for the future of [LOC Spain  ] 's nuclear electricity industry . 
[PER Torres  ] opined that the acceptance of a [ORG Paragraph  ] 7 similar to the revision that has been drafted would mark the " death " of [MISC Spanish  ] participation in this industry. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) To illustrate his concern , [PER Torres  ] described the predicament of [MISC Spanish  ] participation in the [MISC European  ] [ORG Gaseous Diffusion Uranium Enrichment Consortium  ] ( known as [ORG EURODIF  ] ) , in which [ORG ENUSA  ] , a state-owned [MISC Spanish  ] company , has an 11 percent stake . 
( COMMENT: [LOC France  ] has a direct 44 percent stake and also owns a 60 percent stake in a joint venture with [LOC Iran  ] , named [ORG SOFIDIF  ] , that has a further 25 percent share in [ORG EURODIF  ] . 
[LOC Belgium  ] , with 11 percent , and [LOC Italy  ] , with 8 percent , are the other shareholders . 
END COMMENT ) [ORG EURODIF  ] 's uranium enrichment plant in [LOC Tricastin  ] , [LOC France  ] - known as [PER Georges Besse  ] - opened in the 1970s and is expected to be phased out of operation by 2013 because it uses older technology and is not competitive in the market place . 
It is scheduled to be dismantled by 2020 . 
A more efficient successor plant , named [PER Georges Besse II  ] , which uses gas centrifuge technology , is being constructed at a cost of $4.7 billion . 
It is expected to gradually come online , beginning in 2009 , and to reach full production capacity by around <a id='par2016' href='#par2016'>¶</a>2016 . 
However , [LOC France  ] is seeking too high of a price for [ORG EURODIF  ] members to be partners in the new plant , according to [PER Torres  ] , who suggested that [LOC France  ] does not appreciate the role [LOC Spain  ] has played in [ORG EURODIF  ] since its creation in 1973 . 
Consequently , [LOC France  ] 's asking price may force [ORG ENUSA  ] to exit [ORG EURODIF  ] and seek membership in another nuclear consortium . 
[PER Torres  ] explained that [LOC Spain  ] wants the freedom to do business with whomever it wants in this industry , which he described as " strategically very important " to the [ORG GOS  ] . 
However , he claimed that the current revisions to [ORG Paragraph  ] 7 would block [LOC Madrid  ] from doing so. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) Returning to political rather than commercial issues , [PER Torres  ] emphasized that the [ORG GOS  ] is not looking to create a confrontation but is interested in discussing the issue with its allies , which [LOC Madrid  ] already is doing with [LOC Paris  ] . 
[LOC Madrid  ] wants [ORG Paragraph  ] 7 to be revised in a way that would enable [LOC Spain  ] to participate in nuclear consortia of its choosing and to retain the option of being able to pursue enrichment at some point in the future . 
[PER Torres  ] also indicated that he is under the impression that the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG Mission  ] to the [ORG UN  ] in [LOC Vienna  ] does not enjoy open lines of communication with its [LOC U.S.  ] counterpart and perhaps does not enjoy the full confidence of the [ORG USG  ] . 
[PER Torres  ] will be traveling to [LOC Vienna  ] to be part of the [MISC Spanish  ] delegation for the January 15 meeting to discuss revisions to [ORG Paragraph  ] 7 and has signaled that he [LOC MADRID  ] 00000029 002.2 OF 002 hopes to be able to discuss [LOC Madrid  ] 's concerns with the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation . 
He also indicated that he is available to clarify [LOC Spain  ] 's position with [LOC U.S.  ] officials in [LOC Washington.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) COMMENT: Although the [MISC Zapatero  ] administration 's long-stated policy is to phase out nuclear energy plants in [LOC Spain  ] at the end of their useful lives ( see REFTEL A ) , the concerns described by [PER Torres  ] may be part of a behind the scenes effort to keep [LOC Spain  ] 's future energy options open . 
We have no information to suggest that there is any coordination between this effort and the political decision of whether to phase out the plants , or that this implies that political sentiment is swinging against the phaseout . 
END COMMENT .
