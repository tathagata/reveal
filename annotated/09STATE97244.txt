( U ) BEGIN TEXT OF TALKING POINTS: [LOC U.S.  ] MISSILE DEFENSE POLICY - EUROPEAN DECISION - The [LOC White House  ] announced that the President has approved Secretary [PER Gates  ] and the [ORG Joint Chiefs of Staff  ] 's unanimous recommendation for improved missile defenses in [LOC Europe  ] against the threat from [LOC Iran  ] to our forces and families deployed to the region and to our Allies. - [LOC Iran  ] already has hundreds of ballistic missiles that can threaten its neighbors in the [LOC Middle East  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] , and the [MISC Caucasus  ] and it is actively developing and testing ballistic missiles that can reach more and more of [LOC Europe  ] . 
-- Our concern regarding [MISC Iranian  ] missile capabilities is further increased by the fact that our [ORG Intelligence Community  ] continues to assess that [LOC Iran  ] , at a minimum , is keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons. - The new " [MISC Phased  ] , [ORG Adaptive Approach  ] " recommended by Secretary [PER Gates  ] updates and revises the previous program for missile defense in [LOC Europe  ] based on two key findings of the DoD review: STATE 00097244 002 OF 006 -- First , the threat from [LOC Iran  ] 's regional ballistic missiles has developed more rapidly than previously expected . 
At the same time , the threat from potential [MISC Iranian  ] intercontinental ballistic missiles ( ICBMs ) has been slower to develop than we previously expected . 
-- Second , our missile defense capabilities and technologies have advanced significantly . 
Improved interceptor capabilities , such as the currently deployed [LOC Standard Missile-3  ] ( [MISC SM-3  ] ) interceptor and advanced variants that are already in development , permit a more flexible and capable architecture. - Therefore , the President has approved a [MISC Phased  ] , [ORG Adaptive Approach  ] that is responsive to the current threat , but also can incorporate new technologies quickly and cost-effectively to adapt as the threat and our technologies continue to change . 
It will unfold in phases: -- The first phase will speed protection of [LOC U.S.  ] deployed forces , civilians , and families and our [MISC Allies  ] in [LOC Europe  ] against the current threat from [LOC Iran  ] by deploying proven systems by 2011 ) about six or seven years earlier than the previous program . 
-- Subsequent phases will add advanced variant sea- and land-based versions of the [MISC SM-3  ] and cover additional territory in [LOC Europe  ] should the [MISC Iranian  ] threat expand . 
-- In the fourth and final phase we will anticipate augmenting our existing capabilities to defend the [LOC United States  ] against potential advances in [LOC Iran  ] 's ICBM capability with advanced versions of the [MISC SM-3  ] . 
This would be a similar capability to that provided in the program of record. - This improved approach removes the need for a Ground Based Interceptor field in [LOC Poland  ] and features a distributed interceptor and sensor architecture that does not require the single large , fixed radar originally planned to be located in the [LOC Czech Republic  ] . 
-- Under the new approach , land- and sea-based missile defense interceptors and sensors offer some flexibility to be redeployed as the regional ballistic missile threat dictates . 
This distributed network approach also will increase the survivability of the system and provide more opportunities for collaboration with [MISC Allies  ] and partners . 
-- We are beginning consultations with [LOC Poland  ] , the [LOC Czech Republic  ] , and other [MISC Allies  ] on the new approach , and will work with our [ORG NATO  ] Allies on determining locations for the sensors and interceptors , and on integrating the [MISC Phased  ] , [ORG Adaptive Approach  ] with their missile defense capabilities and with the emerging [ORG NATO  ] command and control network. - Strong missile defenses will strengthen our efforts to find a solution that brings [LOC Iran  ] into compliance with its international obligations: the more we can diminish the coercive value of [LOC Iran  ] 's missiles , the less [LOC Iran  ] stands to gain by continuing to develop these destabilizing capabilities. - This set of recommendations comes from an ongoing Congressionally-mandated review that is taking a comprehensive examination of our global approach to missile defense and is consistent with the [ORG Defense Department  ] 's budget choices for fiscal year 2010: -- For example , we added additional funding to field more systems such as Aegis BMD ships and [MISC SM-3  ] interceptors .

To date , those efforts have focused on missile defense systems to protect deployed forces from shorter-range ballistic missile threats. - At the 2009 [ORG NATO  ] summit , Heads of [ORG State and Government  ] tasked experts to examine the potential expansion of the ALTBMD program ) which is designed to be the command and control " backbone " for theater missile defense for deployed forces. - The [LOC United States  ] now proposes a " [ORG Phased Adaptive Approach  ] , " which will reinforce and strengthen on-going [ORG NATO  ] efforts . 
Specifically , we believe that the [ORG Phased Adaptive Approach  ] is fully supportive of the decision to pursue options for a complementary [MISC NATO-wide  ] multi-layered BMD architecture , which currently is envisioned to use [ORG NATO  ] 's command and control backbone architecture . 
This is a flexible and cost-effective approach that leverages proven technologies against a known threat. - Most importantly , the [ORG Phased Adaptive Approach  ] is designed to work in concert with [MISC Allied  ] efforts to provide protection against ballistic missile attack for all [ORG NATO  ] Allies , reflecting the [MISC Alliance  ] principle of indivisibility of security. - The [ORG Phased Adaptive Approach  ] will provide our most proven and operational missile defense capabilities in the near-term , defending [MISC Allied  ] territory sooner against the current [MISC Iranian  ] threat. - [LOC U.S.  ] missile defense efforts will of course be fully interoperable with those of NATO. - We propose that -- subsequent to [MISC Alliance  ] discussions and follow-on briefings in greater detail -- the [MISC Alliance  ] examine how we can integrate the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Phased Adaptive Approach  ] with [ORG NATO  ] missile defense . 
This can be discussed further at the upcoming defense ministerial in [LOC Bratislava.  ] - The [ORG Phased Adaptive Approach  ] would serve to greatly strengthen [ORG NATO  ] 's missile defense capabilities in the face of a growing threat to [MISC Alliance  ] security. - We look forward to engaging the [MISC Alliance  ] in political and technical discussions in the weeks ahead . 
FINANCING ( if raised ) - We will work closely with [MISC Allies  ] to examine broader resourcing requirements for defense of [MISC Allied  ] forces , territories and populations , including the integration of our [ORG Phased Adaptive Approach  ] . 
ROLE FOR [ORG NATO  ] MEMBERS - We have already consulted with the two [MISC Allies  ] that had agreed to host missile defense assets under the previous plan . 
I want to reiterate that we are deeply appreciative of their readiness to take difficult political decisions to respond to the need to better protect allied territories and populations against the threat of ballistic missiles. - We intend to engage in active consultations at [ORG NATO  ] on the best way forward. - The " [ORG Phased Adaptive Approach  ] " is flexible and could be integrated into a [ORG NATO  ] territorial missile defense system . 
There will be a requirement for [MISC Allies  ] to host the sensors and interceptors to be included in the [ORG Phased Adaptive STATE  ] 00097244 004 OF 006 Approach . 
There are many possibilities , and we look forward to continuing our [ORG NATO  ] consultations. - If pressed: At this time , I would prefer not to get into specific issues related to potential Host Nations . 
We have many options in this flexible architecture ) sea- and land-based , northern and southern [LOC Europe  ] . 
We intend to engage soon at [ORG NATO  ] with Allies on those questions. - We expect that [MISC Allied  ] national systems or current [ORG NATO  ] systems will be able to integrate well with the overall phased approach. - Allied contributions can be interoperable with the [ORG Phased Approach  ] missile defense architecture to ensure they form a cost-effective and comprehensive architecture . 
[ORG GROUND BASED  ] INTERCEPTORS - If needed: The [LOC U.S.  ] will continue to develop the [MISC GBI  ] technology for [LOC CONUS  ] defense because domestically it remains a cost-effective option . 
However , we have no plans to pursue [MISC GBIs  ] in [LOC Europe  ] given the promise and track record of [MISC SM-3  ] technology .

( [ORG C/REL  ] [LOC RUSSIA  ] ) BEGIN TEXT OF TALKING POINTS FOR RUSSIA: - The President 's missile defense in [LOC Europe  ] decision will publicly be announced at 10:00 a.m . 
[LOC Washington  ] , [LOC D.C.  ] time . 
The [ORG National Security Advisor  ] , General [PER Jones  ] , will be delivering a similar message to Ambassador Kislyak before the announcement. - The decision is the result of a long review process ; new information on the [MISC Iranian  ] ballistic missile program drove the decision. - [LOC Iran  ] has made more progress on short-range and medium-range ballistic missiles , and less progress on ICBMs than anticipated . 
Now the threat is greater to the [LOC Middle East  ] and to [LOC Europe  ] , with a less immediate threat to the [LOC United States.  ] - We do not plan to deploy [MISC GBIs  ] in [LOC Poland  ] and we will not base the [MISC European  ] [ORG Mid-Course  ] radar in the [LOC Czech Republic  ] . 
Instead , there will be an adaptive , phased approach. - We believe that [LOC Iran  ] plans to deploy hundreds of these short-range and medium-range ballistic missiles . 
Our old plan was designed to intercept only small numbers of ICBMs. - We continue to assess that [LOC Iran  ] , at a minimum , is keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons . 
[LOC Tehran  ] could choose at any time to restart its nuclear weapons program and , eventually , arm its missiles with nuclear warheads. - The new plan for [MISC European  ] missile defense is better designed to protect [LOC Europe  ] from this [MISC Iranian  ] threat that is emerging . 
We intend to deploy the [MISC SM-3  ] interceptor which is what we are deploying in the [LOC Middle East  ] as well . 
SM-3s do not have the capability to threaten [MISC Russian  ] ICBMs. - In the first stages of deployment , we also are seeking to place these interceptors closer to [LOC Iran  ] ( from what I understand , this is exactly the idea that President [PER Putin  ] proposed to President [PER Bush  ] during their July 2007 meeting at [LOC Kennebunkport  ] , [LOC Maine  ] ) . - The new plan calls for radars and detection systems to be deployed closer to [LOC Iran  ] . 
These radars will not have the capacity to track [MISC Russian  ] ICBMs. - With this decision behind us , we now want to move aggressively to launch serious cooperation on missile defense with [LOC Russia.  ] - As the President said during his meeting with President [ORG STATE  ] 00097244 005 OF 006 Medvedev in April , we want to begin by standing up the [ORG Joint Data Exchange Center  ] ( [ORG JDEC  ] ) . 
The hope is to share data from our respective early-warning systems .

( [ORG C/REL JAPAN  ] ) BEGIN TEXT OF TALKING POINTS FOR JAPAN: - The [LOC U.S.  ] greatly appreciates [LOC Japan  ] 's partnership in BMD ; we remain deeply committed to strengthening regional [ORG BMD  ] capabilities including operational cooperation , joint research , and co-development. - Recent [MISC North Korean  ] provocations serve as a reminder of the importance of our cooperative missile defense efforts , which help underpin a strong [ORG U.S.-Japan Alliance  ] and contribute to regional stability. - We remain committed to an effective defense of the [LOC U.S.  ] and our Allies against rogue ballistic missile threats , including [LOC North Korea  ] and , if it continues down its current path , [LOC Iran.  ] - As you are aware , the [ORG BMD Review  ] has undertaken a comprehensive examination of our approach to missile defenses , including an in-depth look at our approach to [MISC European  ] missile defense and in other regions around the world . 
-- [ORG USG  ] discussions with the [ORG MOD  ] and [ORG MOFA  ] over the last several months made clear that you have particular interest in the [MISC European  ] missile defense analysis -- we understand these strategic decisions have an impact in the [MISC Asia-Pacific  ] region and want to make sure you are fully informed of our results . 
-- Throughout the review process the [LOC U.S.  ] recognized and factored in [MISC Japanese  ] concerns/equities especially those related to our on-going discussions with the [MISC Russian  ] Federation. - Although the [ORG BMD Review  ] report is not due to [ORG Congress  ] until this January , we have already reached some important conclusions . 
We have decided to move forward with discussing results now so we do not delay deploying improved defenses for ourselves or our allies . 
OTHER CONSULTATIONS - We would like to explain the President 's decision to you before our public announcement and before we speak with [LOC Russia  ] . 
We are discussing this new [MISC European  ] approach with [LOC Poland  ] , the [LOC Czech Republic  ] , and [ORG NATO  ] , as we speak . 
-- As a close and trusted ally , we consider it important to share this information with you . 
However , in light of past problems with information security , we must insist that you take every precaution to ensure that this information will not be leaked . 
Any leaks would have significant implications for our [MISC European  ] missile defense approach , and would be damaging to our bilateral relationship . 
Should there be a security breach elsewhere , it is important that our governments not officially confirm leaked information if it appears in the media before official release by the [ORG U.S. Government  ] . 
THE [ORG PHASED ADAPTIVE APPROACH  ] - As you have seen , the new plan for [MISC European  ] missile defense will use the [MISC SM-3  ] interceptor , both land- and sea-based , rather than [MISC GBIs  ] included in the previous program. - In many ways , your leadership and partnership in the development of the [MISC SM-3  ] and in operational coordination have been critical to our development of this new approach to [LOC Europe  ] . 
Just as we have cooperatively deployed proven and transportable missile defenses to help defend against ballistic missile threats in the [MISC Asia-Pacific  ] region , we will deploy those same technologies and capabilities in [LOC Europe  ] . 
[ORG STATE  ] 00097244 006 OF 006 - At this time , the new [MISC European  ] approach is based on [MISC U.S.-owned  ] SM-3s . 
However , we will want to look at future missile defense opportunities with [ORG NATO  ] and our [MISC European  ] allies that could include potential sales of a number of missile defense capabilities . 
We would very much like to work with [LOC Japan  ] to make strategic decisions about whether and how our jointly developed missile ( i.e. , the [MISC SM-3  ] [LOC Block IIA  ] ) could be part of that future , and perhaps part of a future networked global system of regional missile defense architectures. - We look forward to continuing our strong partnership on missile defense and growing our cooperative activities . 
[ORG BMD  ] FOR [LOC JAPAN  ] AND [LOC EAST ASIA  ] - As mentioned previously , the phased approach in [LOC Europe  ] is in many ways similar to the approach we have taken with you . 
We believe that our current approach in the [MISC Asia- Pacific  ] region is sound and forms a model that we can draw upon elsewhere . 
Naturally , we will re-engage with you soon on the full findings of our [ORG BMD Review  ] . 
IF ASKED ABOUT BURDEN SHARING AT [LOC NATO:  ] - As you well know , this type of approach creates opportunities for participation ) for example , in command and control , sensors , and interceptors ) and enhanced cooperation , similar to the type that we already enjoy . 
We look forward to engaging with [ORG NATO  ] soon about how our new approach contributes to common defenses and how we can share responsibilities in that effort .

The approach in [LOC Europe  ] complements the emerging [ORG BMD  ] architecture in the [LOC Gulf  ] , which is currently defending against potential [MISC Iranian  ] air and missile threats to our partners and [LOC U.S.  ] forces in the [LOC Gulf  ] region . 
-- We are working to optimize limited assets to ensure that programs in [LOC Europe  ] will not be executed at the expense of our friends and commitment to the defense of the [ORG Gulf Cooperation Council  ] . 
-- [ORG BMD  ] programs in [LOC Europe  ] will not require a diversion of [LOC U.S.  ] assets from the [LOC Gulf.  ] - The [LOC United States  ] has deployed [ORG BMD  ] systems to the [LOC Middle East  ] to protect against the [MISC Iranian  ] missile threat , including AEGIS [ORG BMD  ] presence in the [LOC Persian Gulf  ] and two PATRIOT batteries each in [LOC Bahrain  ] , [LOC Kuwait  ] , [LOC Qatar  ] , and the [LOC UAE  ] . 
-- These [LOC U.S.  ] systems complement the indigenous [ORG BMD  ] systems in the region including [MISC PAC-II  ] capability in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] and [LOC Kuwait  ] , and [ORG Shared Early Warning  ] capability with the [LOC UAE  ] . 
-- The [ORG USG  ] is exploring the possibility of providing additional [ORG BMD  ] coverage to [ORG Gulf Cooperation Council  ] nations if the circumstances warrant .
