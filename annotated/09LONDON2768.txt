However , the relationship will be especially close in the defense sphere under [MISC Tory  ] leadership , [PER Fox  ] stated . 
He affirmed his desire to increase joint defense procurement with the [LOC United States  ] . 
Increasing [MISC U.S.-UK  ] “interoperability is the key” since the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC UK  ] will continue to fight together in the future. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 .

[LOC Afghanistan  ] ----------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Fox  ] , who accompanied [ORG Conservative Party  ] leader [PER David Cameron  ] on a December 4-6 visit to [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( septel ) , expressed confidence regarding [LOC U.S.  ] leadership in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and optimism about the way forward .

) [LOC Iran  ] ---- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) Turning to [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Fox  ] observed that there are three possible outcomes in [LOC Iran:  ] regime change , behavioral change for the regime’s leaders , and “a change of leadership within the regime.” The first two options “won’t happen” soon , although we could be “in the beginning of the end game.” When regime change comes it will likely be a “bloody end , ” [PER Fox  ] stated . 
The regime’s strong hold on power , its implacable hatred of the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Israel  ] , and the [ORG Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps  ] stranglehold on the economy make it extremely unlikely that the regime will change from within , he said . 
He predicted that international negotiations with [LOC Iran  ] would fail .

[PER Fox  ] stated that he had recently met with a group of wealthy , [MISC Iranian  ] expatriates , most of whom expressed support for [ORG Iran’s  ] obtaining a nuclear bomb. “Persian nationalism” more than [MISC Islamic  ] fundamentalism is the basis of [MISC Iranian  ] popular support for a nuclear weapons program. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 .

[LOC Russia  ] would play a more constructive role in regard to [LOC Iran  ] if it began to fear “encirclement” by [LOC China  ] and [LOC Iran  ] . 
[LOC China  ] could be more helpful under the right circumstances , [PER Fox  ] said . 
( Note: Shadow Foreign Secretary [PER William Hague  ] told the Ambassador in a subsequent meeting ( septel ) that in his view [LOC China  ] would probably not be more helpful in regard to [LOC Iran  ] in the foreseeable future , although [LOC Russia  ] would likely play a more constructive role .

[ORG NATO  ] ---- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 .

[PER Fox  ] focused on [ORG NATO  ] in a December 8 [LOC Chatham House  ] speech on “The Way Forward for [MISC NATO.”  ] In those remarks , [PER Fox  ] asserted that “NATO’s mission in [LOC Afghanistan  ] has created further debate on [MISC NATO’s  ] role and even of [MISC NATO’s  ] survival as a defense alliance.” The speech highlights that “neither the financial burden nor the fighting burden is properly shared between [ORG NATO  ] allies” and that the pending [ORG Strategic Concept  ] should address collective responsibilities . 
Fox’s speech affirms the importance of strategic nuclear forces to the [ORG Alliance  ] , as stated in the 1999 [ORG Strategic Concept  ] ; the speech commits a future [ORG Conservative  ] government to “maintaining Britain’s round-the-clock , independent , submarine-based , and strategic nuclear deterrent.” The speech concludes that , despite its shortcomings , [ORG NATO  ] is a “necessity” and “in order to successfully face the threats of the 21st century , [ORG NATO  ] is the only way forward.” ( Note: The full text of the speech is available at www.chathamhouse.org.uk End Note .
