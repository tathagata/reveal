Summary - - - - - 2 . 
( S ) [PER Frances Townsend  ] , Assistant to the President for [ORG Homeland Security and Counterterrorism  ] , met with President [PER Saleh  ] in [LOC Aden  ] on October 22 to discuss mutual cooperation in the War on Terror . 
During the meeting , [PER Saleh  ] accepted [PER Townsend  ] 's request for [ORG USG  ] interrogation of [PER Jamal  ] al-Badawi , convicted architect of the bombing of the [PER USS Cole  ] . 
[PER Saleh  ] blamed " aging agents " in the [ORG Political Security Organization  ] ( [ORG PSO  ] ) for inadequate cooperation , asked the [ORG USG  ] to pressure regional [LOC Gulf  ] countries to stop their support of southern " secessionist " movements , accepted [PER Townsend  ] 's offer of [ORG USG  ] assistance in preparation of counterterrorism and cash courier laws , and agreed to the need for joint operations to combat terrorism outside [LOC Yemen  ] . 
[PER Saleh  ] also warned against the threat of [LOC Iran  ] , specifically with regard to its role inside [LOC Iraq  ] , and promised to do more to curb the flow of young [MISC Yemeni  ] men going to fight in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The meeting was generally a constructive one , with the [MISC Yemeni  ] President making some positive commitments . 
Post will continue to work with the [ORG ROYG  ] to ensure these commitments are not forgotten . 
End Summary [PER Jamal  ] " He is Under my [MISC Microscope  ] " al-Badawi and Friends - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 3 . 
( S ) [PER Frances Townsend  ] , Assistant to the President for [ORG Homeland Security and Counterterrorism  ] , met with President [PER Ali Abdullah Saleh  ] in [LOC Aden  ] on October 22 to discuss mutual cooperation in the War on Terror . 
During the lunch portion of the meeting , also attended by the Foreign Minister , the Governor of [LOC Aden  ] , and a member of [LOC Parliament  ] , she asked for an update on the status of [PER Jamal  ] al-Badawi , convicted architect of the bombing of the [PER USS Cole  ] ( ref B ) . 
The President confirmed al-Badawi 's release , clarifying that he is under house arrest , living and working on his farm near [LOC Aden  ] , while the [ORG ROYG  ] closely monitors him . 
[PER Saleh  ] added that while [MISC Yemeni  ] authorities pursued al-Badawi , the [ORG ROYG  ] was transmitting messages to him " promising " that if he turned himself in , his " situation would get better . 
" [PER Saleh  ] said he personally met with al-Badawi " two weeks ago " and had a frank discussion with him . 
" Al-Badawi promised to give up terrorism and I told him that his actions damaged [LOC Yemen  ] and its image ; he began to understand , " [PER Saleh  ] said . 
4 . 
( S ) [PER Townsend  ] expressed dismay over al-Badawi 's release and asked for [ORG USG  ] access to interrogate him . 
[PER Saleh  ] told [PER Townsend  ] not to worry , " he is under my microscope , " but had no objections to her request , reiterating numerous times that interested [ORG USG  ] entities could interrogate al-Badawi by coordinating with the [ORG Political Security Organization  ] ( [ORG PSO  ] ) . 
5 . 
( S ) [PER Saleh  ] specifically mentioned two other escapees that remain at large: [PER Abdullah  ] al-Wadi'i and Nasr al-Wahishi . 
He said al-Wahishi had taken the place of [LOC Abu Ali  ] as head of [LOC al-Qaeda  ] in [LOC Yemen  ] . 
[PER Townsend  ] reiterated [ORG USG  ] concern over the [ORG ROYG  ] 's house arrest system , with a reference to the cases of [PER Ibrahim Makri  ] and [ORG Mansur  ] al-Bahani , both of whom were linked to terrorist activity while under house arrest . 
Weapons Trafficking: You Can't Make This [MISC Stuff Up  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 6 . 
( C ) As [PER Townsend  ] began to ask [PER Saleh  ] about his efforts to combat weapons trafficking , [PER Saleh  ] interrupted her to invite one of [LOC Yemen  ] 's top three weapons traffickers , [PER Faris Mana'a  ] , into the lunch meeting . 
When [PER Mana'a  ] , who met with the President earlier in the day , entered the room , [PER Saleh  ] jokingly addressed the Embassy Assistant Legal Attach ( [PER Legatt  ] ) , saying , " hey [ORG FBI  ] , if he does not behave properly , you can take him... back to [LOC Washington  ] in [PER Townsend  ] 's plane or to [LOC Guantanamo  ] . 
" The [PER Legatt  ] replied , " we could put both [PER Mana'a  ] and al-Badawi on the plane ; " however , the translator did not report this to [PER Saleh  ] , making it unlikely that the President heard the [PER Legatt  ] 's reply . 
Meanwhile , Presidential staff provided [PER Mana'a  ] with a chair at the table . 
[PER Saleh  ] explained that the [ORG ROYG  ] had recently confiscated a shipment of " pistols " from [PER Mana'a  ] and given them to the military . 
[PER Townsend  ] lightheartedly commented , " he has donated weapons to the nation 's military -- he can be considered a patriot now . 
" [PER Saleh  ] responded with laughter , saying , " no , he is a double agent -- he also gave weapons to the al-Houthi rebels . 
" The President said the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] was the only entity in [LOC Yemen  ] authorized to purchase weapons . 
( Comment: If the President , s statement were an accurate portrayal of the situation , arms dealers would effectively be out of business . 
[PER Saleh  ] 's comment has been made to Post numerous times before . 
This , and [PER Mana'a  ] 's presence at the Palace , raises serious questions about the President 's commitment to stopping weapons trafficking . 
[PER Mana'a  ] also runs a construction company and a petroleum services business , with contracts in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
His ties to [PER Saleh  ] may extend beyond money made from the weapons trade . 
End Comment ) 7 . 
( C ) [PER Saleh  ] said the new weapons ban ( ref C ) in [LOC Yemen  ] 's major cities had been a success , receiving a surprisingly positive public response . 
He specified that in the past month 45,000 pieces of weaponry had been collected . 
The Governor of [LOC Aden  ] added that his city was " 100% clean of weapons . 
" [PER Saleh  ] expressed a desire to " follow the [LOC United States  ] example " of licensing guns . 
When asked by the [PER Legatt  ] if he was going to expand the weapons ban outside major cities , [PER Saleh  ] responded that it is a " step-by-step " process . 
PSO: The [ORG Old Guard  ] is the Problem - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 8 . 
( S ) [PER Townsend  ] complimented [LOC Yemen  ] 's [ORG National Security Bureau  ] , saying , " it has done good work , despite its youth , " yet complained of a lack of cooperation from the [ORG PSO  ] with the [ORG USG  ] . 
[PER Saleh  ] replied that his proposed constitutional amendments ( ref A ) were the first step in addressing this problem . 
At Foreign Minister al-Qirbi 's insistence , [PER Saleh  ] elaborated upon his answer , adding that , " although the [ORG PSO  ] has firm orders to cooperate and respond quickly , its agents are aging , " alluding to [ORG PSO  ] Head , [PER Ghalib Mutahi  ] [MISC Qamish  ] . 
( Note: [MISC Qamish  ] has been a topic of ( sometimes tense ) discussion between [PER Townsend  ] and [PER Saleh  ] in the past . 
End Note ) The [ORG Gulf Factor: Fueling Southern Unrest  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 9 . 
( S ) While [PER Saleh  ] claimed the situation in the rebellious northern [PER Saada governorate  ] was " very calm , " he expressed apprehension over the unrest in the [LOC South  ] . 
The President asked the [ORG USG  ] to pressure countries funding southern opposition , saying , " it is important that [LOC Yemen  ] not reach a state of instability . 
We need your support . 
" [PER Townsend  ] replied , " you do not even have to think about it . 
Of course we support [LOC Yemen  ] . 
" 10 . 
( S ) [PER Saleh  ] asserted that neighboring [MISC Arab  ] countries were intent on destabilizing his country by supporting the southern " secessionist " movement , " not because they have anything against [LOC Yemen  ] , but because we are following the [MISC United States'  ] democracy model , and they do not want a democracy in the region . 
" He specifically referred to Crown [PER Prince Sultan  ] of [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , but inculpated other [LOC Gulf  ] countries as well . 
According to [PER Saleh  ] , [MISC Gulf Islamic  ] organizations are funding the opposition in the [LOC South  ] and supporting secessionist movement leaders living in [LOC Oman  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] , and [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
He said some of those regional [MISC Islamic  ] organizations had links to the radical factions within the [MISC Islamist  ] opposition party Islah - calling them " jihadists , salafis , and al-Qaeda . 
" ( Note: Islah is the largest opposition party in [LOC Yemen  ] and is largely recognized as moderate . 
It includes radical factions that are considered to be a minority . 
End Note ) [ORG USG Support: CT  ] , [ORG Cash Courier Law and Joint Operations  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 11 . 
( C ) [PER Townsend  ] asked about the progress of [LOC Yemen  ] 's draft counterterrorism ( [LOC CT  ] ) law . 
[PER Saleh  ] answered , " it has come a long way , but we have not yet fully achieved our goals . 
" [PER Townsend  ] offered [ORG USG  ] technical assistance in drafting the law and training for its implementation , which [PER Saleh  ] casually accepted . 
( Note: The Minister of Legal Affairs recently rejected an offer for the same assistance ( ref D ) . 
The lack of an effective [LOC CT  ] law sometimes leaves the [ORG ROYG  ] without a legal basis to hold terrorists . 
Post views passage of a comprehensive [ORG CT Law  ] as a significant step in strengthening counterterrorism bilateral relations . 
End Note ) 12 . 
( C ) [PER Townsend  ] recommended a cash courier law to strengthen [LOC Yemen  ] 's efforts at combating terrorism and proposed [ORG USG  ] assistance with the drafting of this law as well , which [PER Saleh  ] also nonchalantly accepted . 
( Comment: [PER Saleh  ] 's informal manner makes it unclear how resolute he was in accepting , yet it is certain that he did not reject the offers made by [PER Townsend  ] and generally agreed to her proposals . 
End Comment ) 13 . 
( S ) [PER Townsend  ] said [ORG USG  ] agencies want to work with the [ORG ROYG  ] on counterterrorism outside , not just inside , [LOC Yemen  ] . 
[PER Saleh  ] agreed . 
He noted that [PER Usama bin Laden  ] 's personal bodyguards are all [MISC Yemeni  ] , alluding to the need for [MISC USG-ROYG  ] cooperation in the tribal areas between [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Saleh  ] added that " violence by governments is not always the answer , " and asked for greater [ORG USG  ] assistance in development . 
( Note: [LOC Yemen  ] is a beneficiary of significant non-CT aid through the [LOC Middle East Partnership Initiative  ] , the [ORG US Department of Agriculture Food for Progress Program  ] and , as of November 1 , returns to the [MISC Millennium Challenge Cooperation  ] 's [ORG Threshold Country Program  ] . 
End Note ) [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Iran  ] - - - - - - - - - 14 . 
( S ) Throughout the meeting , [PER Saleh  ] repeatedly asked about [LOC Iran  ] and the [ORG USG  ] 's position vis-a-vis the country . 
[PER Townsend  ] replied that if [LOC Iran  ] does not get serious , the [ORG USG  ] will be forced to return to the [ORG United Nations  ] to request more sanctions . 
15 . 
( S ) [PER Saleh  ] warned [PER Townsend  ] about [LOC Qatar  ] 's relationship with [LOC Iran  ] , cautioning that although the two countries are allies , [LOC Iran  ] could turn on [LOC Qatar  ] at any time . 
[PER Townsend  ] agreed , saying she had relayed the same message to [LOC Qatar  ] , and asked [PER Saleh  ] if he had spoken to the [MISC Qatari  ] [ORG Emir  ] about this matter . 
[PER Saleh  ] responded , " of course . 
" He also asked [PER Townsend  ] to deliver a verbatim message to President [PER Bush  ] about Iran: " you must discipline and tame a child when he is young . 
" 16 . 
( S ) On [LOC Iraq  ] , [PER Saleh  ] asked [PER Townsend  ] to tell President [PER Bush  ] that , " [PER Maliki  ] represents [LOC Iran  ] in [LOC Iraq  ] , he is worse than [MISC Ahmedinejad  ] . 
" He repeatedly referred to [PER Maliki  ] as a " dog , " although the embarrassed interpreter substituted the word " he . 
" Foreign Fighters to [LOC Iraq  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - 17 . 
( S ) [PER Townsend  ] expressed [ORG USG  ] concern over young [MISC Yemeni  ] men going to fight in [LOC Iraq  ] and asked [PER Saleh  ] to do more to tackle the problem . 
[PER Saleh  ] replied that it is an extremely difficult task , as [MISC Yemeni  ] men do not travel directly to [LOC Iraq  ] . 
They first travel to [LOC Cairo  ] , [LOC Damascus  ] , or [LOC Riyadh  ] , making it practically impossible to track who is traveling to [LOC Baghdad  ] . 
[PER Townsend  ] suggested publicly announcing airport interrogations of young men suspected of going to [LOC Iraq  ] . 
She noted that the fear of getting caught itself might stem the flow of foreign fighters . 
[PER Saleh  ] agreed and said the [ORG ROYG  ] will try to do more . 
( Note: [MISC Yemeni  ] security services currently try to scrutinize young male [MISC Yemeni  ] travelers , particularly those traveling to [LOC Damascus  ] , as a means to identify foreign fighters , and sometimes deny them travel . 
End Note ) Letters Exchanged - - - - - - - - - - 18 . 
( C ) [PER Townsend  ] delivered a letter from President [PER Bush  ] to President [PER Saleh  ] . 
The letter was read by both [PER Saleh  ] and Foreign Minister al-Qirbi . 
[PER Saleh  ] responded to it by emphasizing [LOC Yemen  ] 's willingness to " cooperate with everything that is included in President [PER Bush  ] 's letter . 
" With this , he insisted the [LOC United States  ] continue to support [LOC Yemen  ] , both financially and politically , and " stand in the way of those against us . 
" [PER Saleh  ] presented [PER Townsend  ] with a letter for President [PER Bush  ] and a report on [LOC Yemen  ] 's efforts to combat terrorism . 
Comment - - - - - 19 . 
( S ) Overall , this meeting was more constructive than some observers would have expected . 
Given [PER Saleh  ] 's colorful character and knack for theatrics , the inclusion of a weapons trafficker during his lunch with [PER Townsend  ] was not a complete surprise . 
[PER Saleh  ] 's action was seen by some as a veiled threat to [LOC Mana'a  ] , but was clearly also a message to the [ORG USG  ] that in his country he will do as he pleases . 
Like other leaders in the region , [PER Saleh  ] is loathe to be perceived as subservient to [LOC US  ] or [MISC Western  ] interests . 
His use of the dual threats of terrorism and instability when referring to internal conflict is also not new . 
[PER Saleh  ] consistently uses this tactic when attempting to garner [ORG USG  ] support . 
[PER Saleh  ] 's allowing [ORG USG  ] interrogation of al-Badawi is positive . 
The fact that [PER Saleh  ] released this convicted terrorist , despite [ORG USG  ] objections , however , is cause for concern . 
[PER Saleh  ] 's acceptance of [PER Townsend  ] 's proposal of assistance in drafting the [LOC CT  ] and cash courier law and his commitment to joint action to combat terrorism outside [LOC Yemen  ] are welcome developments , as is his willingness to cooperate to stem the flow of [MISC Yemeni  ] fighters to [LOC Iraq  ] , even if his acceptance of these ideas is nonchalant . 
Post will continue to work with the [ORG ROYG  ] to ensure these commitments are not forgotten . 
20 . 
( U ) Minimize considered for [LOC Baghdad  ] .
