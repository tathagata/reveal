( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC SUMMARY:  ] Although presidential elections are not slated until February 2012 , the ruling [ORG Democratic Party of Senegal  ] ( [ORG PDS  ] ) and the opposition [PER Benno coalition  ] ( unity in [LOC Wolof  ] ) continue to spar against one another while internal debates rage as to who will represent them in the election . 
President [PER Abdoulaye Wade  ] 's plan to have his son [PER Karim succeed  ] him is not popular among the [MISC Senegalese  ] , a fact that led him to announce that he will run in 2012 ( at the age of 86 ) for a seven-year term . 
This comes amid rumors of yet another constitutional amendment in the works - this time aimed at eliminating a second round runoff - thus increasing the chances of [PER Wade  ] being reelected . 
End Summary . 
Call for political dialogue --------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Most of [LOC Senegal  ] 's leading opposition parties are not represented in the [ORG National Assembly  ] after they boycottd the 2007 legislative elections . 
Following those elections , the opposition called for a politica dialogue to address the electoral law and to reorm voter registration . 
Until the [ORG PDS  ] lost big inrecnt local elections , [PER Wade  ] had continually refsed this call , saying that he would not bail out an opposition that was paying for bad political choices . 
However , now a new paradigm exists whereby political dialogue is less urgent for the opposition but more so for [PER Wade  ] . 
Out Come the Skeletons ---------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In July , the opposition demanded that [PER Wade  ] include in any agenda of dialogue a discussion of the assassination of Judge Seye in 1993 . 
At the time [PER Wade  ] was accused of being its instigator , a rumor that gained traction when he pardoned all the perpetrators who were jailed in the case after winning the Presidency in 2000 . 
[PER Wade  ] 's response to this request left the opposition astounded . 
He accused the [ORG Socialist Party  ] , who had ruled the country from 1960 to 2000 , of being behind the assassination of Police Chief [PER Sadibou Ndiaye  ] in 1989 and the mysterious deaths of two young female albinos whose disappearance was never clarified . 
He threatened to reveal more if the opposition continued down this path . 
The opposition duly dropped the matter and , in a letter dated October 8 , they proposed nine points of discussion for a dialogue . 
These included: urgent social issues , the electoral system , the [LOC Casamance  ] crisis , public finances , political and institutional governance , liberties and the rule of law , the business environment and employment . 
President [PER Wade  ] accepted all nine points , even though he had initially refused to discuss electoral and human rights issues , arguing that the electoral system was good enough to allow the opposition to win local elections and that [LOC Senegal  ] 's election to the [ORG United Nation  ] 's [ORG Human Rights Council  ] underlined his government 's positive track record . 
However , his acceptance came with preconditions . 
He demanded that the issues of public finance be discussed with government ministers live on camera in the presence of religious leaders and diplomats . 
The opposition rejected these preconditions and the process is now at a standstill . 
[PER Wade  ] Unites his Satraps ----------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Wade  ] 's most recent political strategy aims to reduce dissent in his coalition . 
By appointing senior dissident leader [PER Aminata Tall  ] to a top position in the cabinet and negotiating with his former Prime Minister [PER Idrissa Seck  ] , who is rumored to be making a comeback to reenergize the [ORG PDS  ] , [PER Wade  ] is hoping to create a grand presidential coalition that will once again carry him to power . 
However , the reality is that this strategy is fragile , as popular former Prime Minister [PER Macky Sall  ] is opposed to returning to [PER Wade  ] 's coalition and [PER Idrissa Seck  ] and [PER Karim Wade  ] detest one another . 
The President is cornered , but... ------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) President [PER Wade  ] is in a difficult political situation as his old age , the rejection of his son by the [MISC Senegalese  ] people , and the fact that he has black widow-like eliminated all potential young leaders who could succeed him have left him cornered . 
Meanwhile , as most [MISC Senegalese  ] struggle to make ends meet and have lost hope in the face of massive unemployment , [PER Wade  ] and his entourage are engulfed in financial scandals . 
A couple of weeks after his attempt to bribe former [ORG IMF  ] Resrep [PER Alex Segura  ] , [PER Wade  ] had [MISC CFA  ] 52 million stolen from his apartment in [LOC Paris  ] by a member of his entourage . 
A close relative of [PER Wade  ] told Embassy that this is not the first time the President has been a victim of such theft. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) However , the opposition remains paralyzed and has so far failed to capitalize on recent [ORG PDS  ] setbacks because no decision has been made as to whether [PER Benno  ] will unite behind one candidate or whether they will respect the charter of good governance that they signed in May 2009 following a [ORG National Dialogue  ] . 
This dialogue envisioned a transition government to reform the political system DAKAR 00001376 002 OF 002 from a presidential to a parliamentarian one . 
Views of opposition leaders --------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Ibrahima Sene  ] , Deputy Leader of the [ORG Party of Independence and Labor  ] ( [ORG PIT  ] ) , told [PER Poloff  ] that his party will stick to the conclusions of the [ORG National Dialogue  ] . 
He supports a short transition period of twelve to eighteen months , during which time a new constitution and electoral law would be voted in and a parliamentary regime introduced . 
For his part former Prime Minister [PER Moustapha Niasse  ] , the leader of [ORG AFP  ] who is 72 , wishes to be the candidate of [PER Benno  ] but faces strong opposition from the [ORG Socialist Party  ] . 
[PER Niasse  ] is a rich and well-known politician who financially and politically contributed to [PER Wade  ] 's victory in 2000 . 
For [PER Niasse  ] , this is his last chance to be President as he nears the end of his political career . 
He denied to [MISC PolCouns  ] rumors that he was solely focused on being the candidate of [PER Benno  ] , adding that he supports a serious debate on institutional reforms and the nature of [LOC Senegal  ] 's political system . 
He " is open to all possibilities " as long as the goal of [PER Benno  ] remains to remove [PER Wade  ] from power. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Ousmane Tanor Dieng  ] , the leader of the [ORG Socialist Party  ] , told [MISC PolCouns  ] he was against a transition and that the [PER Benno  ] candidate should be determined by primaries . 
It is not clear that [PER Benno  ] has the required organization or even desire to go to primaries given the large number of small party leaders who would lose their influence in such a selection process . 
However , [PER Tanor  ] confessed that if [PER Wade  ] eliminates the second round runoff , they will have no other choice but to agree on one candidate . 
[PER Talla Sylla  ] , the fiery young leader of [PER Jeuf Jeul  ] , indicated that there is a consensus being formed around [PER Niasse  ] as the candidate and he predicted that [PER Tanor  ] will be isolated if he persists with the idea of holding primaries . 
[PER Macky Sall  ] , the leader of [LOC APR/Yakaar  ] , a party he created after [PER Wade  ] removed him as Chairman of the [ORG National Assembly  ] , told [PER Poloff  ] that he neither believed in changing the current system nor in [PER Benno  ] having one candidate . 
He then boldly declared himself ready to run against [PER Wade  ] adding that both [PER Niasse  ] and [PER Tanor  ] are " outdated . 
" <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) COMMENT: Over the last thirty years [PER Wade  ] has proved to be a savvy politician who has always managed to turn around the most difficult of situations . 
But his defeat in the local elections of March 2009 is a clear indication that the voters are tired and have grown weary of [PER Wade  ] 's increasingly aloof administration . 
Now the challenge is for [PER Benno  ] to unite and clearly articulate their vision for political , economic , and institutional reforms . 
However , of greater worry is what would happen in the event that [PER Wade  ] dies before designating a successor . 
As it stands , both the [ORG PDS  ] and [PER Benno  ] are internally , deeply divided and there are real concerns that neither group is ready to fill the gap in event of [PER Wade  ] 's demise , which would likely lead to a period of vicious internecine political fighting in both camps and general instability in the country .
