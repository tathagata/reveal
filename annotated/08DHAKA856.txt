Moriarty  ] . 
Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) Summary ======= <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) The leadership of [ORG Bangladesh’s Rapid Action Battalion  ] ( [ORG RAB  ] ) has pledged to provide additional information about alleged human rights violations committed by members of the force since its inception in 2004 . 
This pledge came during two days of intensive fact-finding and discussions with members of an interagency [ORG USG  ] team that visited [LOC Bangladesh  ] to assess both the [MISC RAB’s  ] current operating procedures regarding human rights violations as well as possibilities for engagement . 
The [ORG RAB  ] seeks a broad engagement with the [ORG USG  ] including human rights and counterterrorism training and recognizes the need to address allegations of past abuses . 
While there are lingering concerns about the [MISC RAB’s  ] human rights record , there is a widespread belief within civil society that the [ORG RAB  ] has succeeded in reducing crime and fighting terrorism , making it in many ways [ORG Bangladesh’s  ] most respected police unit . 
A possible stumbling block moving forward is inertia within some levels of the government bureaucracy , primarily within [ORG Bangladesh’s Home Ministry  ] , which we are trying to overcome through repeated high-level interventions with [MISC Bangladeshi  ] government decision-makers . 
[ORG RAB  ] Pledges Full Support After Meetings with [ORG USG Team  ] ============================================= ======== <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) A [ORG USG  ] interagency team from the [ORG Departments of State  ] , [LOC Defense  ] , and [ORG Justice  ] visited [LOC Dhaka  ] July 12 - 16 to conduct an assessment of [ORG Bangladesh’s Rapid Action Battalion  ] ( [ORG RAB  ] ) , focusing on whether and how the [ORG USG  ] might engage with the force . 
During the visit , the team met with the [ORG RAB  ] senior leadership , visited the training academy outside of [LOC Dhaka  ] , and visited two of the [MISC RAB’s  ] operational battalions ( in [LOC Narayangang  ] and [LOC Sirajgang  ] ) . 
In addition to the meetings with the [ORG RAB  ] , the team met with representatives from civil society , including journalists , human rights groups , and business leaders , in both [LOC Dhaka  ] and the field . 
On their final day , the team met with officials from the [ORG Ministries of Foreign and Home Affairs  ] . 
Representatives of the [MISC Embassy’s  ] inter-agency [ORG Counter Terrorism Working Group  ] also participated in the assessment team’s meetings. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The assessment team’s visit followed several months of intensive discussions between the [ORG RAB  ] and the Embassy , as well as meetings with senior visiting officials , including DRL DAS Barks-Ruggles and S/CT Coordinator Ambassador [PER Dailey  ] . 
In these previous meetings , [ORG USG  ] officials informed the [ORG RAB  ] of our desire to help improve its human rights record and build its counter terrorism and law enforcement capacity but underscored the need for greater transparency and accountability . 
The officials explained that our ability to offer training or assistance is currently constrained by the [MISC RAB’s  ] alleged human rights violations , which have rendered the organization ineligible to receive training and assistance according to the [PER Leahy  ] legislation. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The two days of meetings with the [ORG RAB  ] , therefore , focused on gaining a better understanding of the [MISC RAB’s  ] past human rights record and the procedures in place to prevent , investigate and adjudicate abuses . 
The team was briefed on the [MISC RAB’s  ] efforts to incorporate human rights training into the curriculum at the training academy and at the unit level . 
This training , some of which is conducted by a local human rights group , is given to all new personnel transferring into the [ORG RAB  ] . 
( Note: Although it shares our concerns , the [ORG British High Commission  ] has already started a pilot round of [ORG Human Rights  ] training with the [ORG RAB  ] ; the [MISC British  ] will closely monitor program impact before launching a second round , which will require Ministerial approval . 
) According to [ORG RAB  ] officials , allegations of abuses are handled both through internal disciplinary measures as well as through an administrative investigation by magistrates and the local court system . 
In response to repeated requests from the team for greater information about the magistrates’ reports , the [MISC RAB’s  ] senior leadership pledged to explore providing this information to the [MISC USG.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The discussions with the [ORG RAB  ] also provided the assessment team with insight into the areas in which [ORG USG  ] assistance , at both the tactical and operational level , could be most effective . 
The [ORG RAB  ] also provided additional information about its organizational structure and personnel policies , which will help us determine how individuals and units might be held accountable for past abuses . 
Meetings with [ORG Civil Society Provide Nuanced View  ] ============================================= === <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In order to provide the assessment team with a balanced view of the [ORG RAB  ] , we arranged meetings with members of civil society in [LOC Dhaka  ] and during field visits . 
As a result , team members were able to hear from journalists , academics , human rights advocates , and business leaders , and informally through people requesting assistance from the [ORG RAB  ] , about perceptions of the [MISC RAB’s  ] past and current conduct . 
There were reports of abuses and a pattern of misrepresentation by the [ORG RAB  ] regarding so-called “encounter/crossfire killings.” The [ORG Assessment Team  ] interviewed [ORG NGOs  ] , media personnel , and members of civil society who reported that members of the [ORG RAB  ] , possibly on instruction from senior government officials , have unlawfully used lethal force to eliminate their targets . 
All we talked with agreed , however , that the [MISC RAB’s  ] human rights performance had improved during the current [ORG Caretaker Government  ] and under the leadership of the current Director General ( a career police officer and [ORG DS/ATA  ] graduate ) . <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) A strong message from many civil society interlocutors was that the [ORG RAB  ] enjoys a great deal of respect and admiration from a population scarred by decreasing law and order in the last decade . 
Moreover , given the persistent corruption and ineffectiveness of other elements of the police , the [ORG RAB  ] has come to be seen by many as a preferred alternative . 
According to some [ORG NGO  ] sources , people in remote areas , particularly women , feel more comfortable coming forward to the [ORG RAB  ] because they think their complaints will be dealt with in a more effective and honest manner . 
The team noted that the [ORG RAB  ] and many civil society representatives seem prepared to accept that some notorious individuals will die in encounters with the [ORG RAB  ] , and they seem to prefer that outcome as opposed to the chance of the currently ineffective and backlogged court system acquitting the guilty . 
What this highlights is that our desire to improve respect for human rights will require not only engagement with the [ORG RAB  ] , but efforts to help improve other elements of the [MISC Bangladeshi  ] judicial systems and police . 
Our recently approved 1210 proposal would establish a community policing program that could assist such effort . 
Bureaucracy is Potential Stumbling Block ======================================= <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The team’s final meetings with representatives of the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] and [ORG Home Ministry  ] indicated that some levels of the government bureaucracy may still be reluctant to share information about past alleged human rights abuses . 
In 2007 , an inter-agency Embassy team met with [ORG GOB  ] counterparts to develop a mechanism for investigating allegations of human rights violations by the security forces , including [ORG RAB  ] . 
This responsibility was given to a Deputy Secretary at the [ORG Ministry of Home Affairs  ] , but despite some positive initial meetings there has been little tangible outcome from these sessions . 
During the [ORG Assessment Team’s  ] meeting with the Acting Home Secretary , he displayed little enthusiasm for taking the steps needed to move ahead with an engagement program . 
The team underscored that it needed information from the [ORG Home Ministry  ] regarding abuses by the [ORG RAB  ] in order to effectively vet candidates in accordance with [PER Leahy  ] legislation . 
Fortunately , this meeting coincided with [ORG Home  ] Secretary [PER Abdul Karim’s  ] visit to [LOC Washington  ] , which provided senior officials in [LOC SCA  ] , DRL and [LOC DOD  ] to reinforce the importance of [ORG GOB  ] information-sharing about past abuses . 
Comment ======= <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Embassy [LOC Dhaka  ] greatly appreciates the efforts of State , DoD , and Justice to send the assessment team to [LOC Bangladesh  ] to interact with the [ORG RAB  ] . 
Post looks forward to receiving the results of the assessment team’s analysis of the [ORG RAB  ] . 
Our multi-agency and multi-disciplinary team signaled the seriousness with which the [ORG USG  ] views potential [ORG RAB  ] engagement . 
We were clear in our meetings with the [ORG GOB  ] that we are eager to engage , but committed to doing so in a manner consistent with [PER Leahy  ] legislation . 
We expect that the [ORG Bangladeshi Government  ] will reciprocate by providing us with some of the additional information we need to move forward . 
At the same time , we may need to ensure that a few unenthusiastic bureaucrats do not foil plans for further cooperation that are strongly supported by the [ORG RAB  ] and at least some senior government officials . 
Embassy [LOC Dhaka  ] looks forward to working with the inter-agency team in [LOC Washington  ] as we consider next steps in this process. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) The inter-agency assessment team has cleared this message .
