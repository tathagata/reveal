CHIEF OF PROTOCOL DISAPPOINTED WITH [PER MEGRAHI  ] RECEPTION 2 . 
( C ) During an August 24 meeting with A/DCM to discuss visa issues , [ORG Nuri  ] al-Mismari , the chief of [MISC Libyan  ] Protocol ( a ministerial-level position ) and a close advisor to [PER Qadafhi  ] , launched into an unprompted 15-minute lament about " the trouble " resulting from [PER Megrahi  ] 's release . 
Literally wringing his hands , [PER Mismari  ] noted that he " strongly disagreed " with [PER Megrahi  ] 's reception in [LOC Libya  ] and stressed that " if I had been here rather than traveling , this would have been handled differently . 
" Commenting that he had just come from a 1.5 hour long interagency meeting on the topic of [PER Megrahi  ] , [PER Mismari  ] said that he , FM [PER Musa Kusa  ] , A/S-equivalent for [ORG European Affairs  ] Abdulati al-Obeidi and former Minister of Interior and current head of [PER Qadafhi  ] 's security Izzedine al-Hinshiri were all in agreement that [PER Megrahi  ] 's reception had been a " big mistake , " and were concerned about the international ramifications for [LOC Libya  ] . 
Sighing deeply , [PER Mismari  ] mused that during his upcoming trip to [LOC New York  ] for the [ORG UN General Assembly  ] session , [PER Qadafhi  ] " could have had meetings with President [PER Obama  ] and many [MISC Congressmen  ] , but now , I know that is impossible . 
" 3 . 
( C ) A/DCM highlighted the negative USG reaction to [PER Megrahi  ] 's release , reiterating the [LOC White House  ] and Secretary 's comments . 
Underscoring the President 's public remarks about house arrest , she said [PER Megrahi  ] 's presence at any upcoming September 1 celebrations would be highly problematic . 
[PER Mismari  ] , nodding in agreement opined , " [PER Megrahi  ] is a sick man , and it would be best if he was particularly sick , and bedridden , on September 1 . 
" He noted that he had reviewed the September 1 " seating chart " earlier in the day , and that [PER Megrahi  ] 's name was not on it . 
[PER Mismari  ] said he did not know [PER Megrahi  ] well , and so did not feel he could personally reach out to him , but pledged to contact both Head of [ORG Military Intelligence Abdullah Sanussi  ] , who he asserted is from the same tribal confederation as [PER Megrahi  ] , as well as another unnamed [ORG MFA  ] official who [PER Megrahi  ] 's relative: " I will tell them to ask [PER Megrahi  ] not to request an invitation to any September 1 events , and that if he does receive an invite , for the good of the country , he must make the sacrifice and not attend . 
" A/DCM inquired if recent [MISC Libyan  ] press reports that [PER Megrahi  ] may receive a medal of honor from the [MISC Libyan  ] People 's [ORG Congress  ] were correct ( reftel ) . 
[PER Mismari  ] replied that he had not heard of any such plans , but grimacing and rolling his eyes upwards in an apparent reference to [PER Qadafhi  ] , remarked that " anything can happen , although inshallah , it will not . 
" SIMILAR MESSAGE FROM [PER OBEIDI  ] TO THE [LOC UK  ] 4 . 
( C ) [LOC UK  ] Ambassador [PER Vincent Fean  ] reported that he had a similar conversation with [PER Obeidi  ] on August 24 . 
[PER Fean  ] had met with [PER Obeidi  ] on instructions from [LOC London  ] , to express the [LOC UK  ] 's disappointment at [PER Megrahi  ] 's reception and to urge the [MISC Libyan  ] Government to avoid any further public activity for [PER Megrahi  ] . 
[PER Fean  ] said that [PER Obeidi  ] made no effort to defend [PER Megrahi  ] 's reception but said that he and Foreign Minister [PER Musa Kusa  ] had been " surprised " by the scene at the airport . 
[PER Obeidi  ] told the [LOC UK  ] Ambassador that " enough is enough ; it is important to avoid anything that will make the situation worse . 
" [PER Obeidi  ] promised to convey this message to higher-level officials . 
5 . 
( C ) [PER Fean  ] said the [LOC UK  ] has " fairly strong " assurances that [PER Megrahi  ] will not be present at the September 1 festivities marking the 40th anniversary of [PER Qadhafi  ] 's coup . 
Both Prime Minister [PER Al Baghdadi  ] al-Mahmoudi and [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000689 002.2 OF 002 had separately provided these assurances to the [MISC British  ] Government: [PER Al Bagdadi  ] in response to [LOC UK  ] PM Brown 's letter to [PER Qadhafi  ] , and [PER Saif  ] al-Islam in a telephone conversation with " someone in [LOC London  ] . 
" [PER Fean  ] said that [PER Saif  ] al-Islam 's pledge had been somewhat convoluted , as [PER Saif  ] al-Islam said simply: " If we need to say [PER Megrahi  ] will not be there , we will not contradict that . 
" When pressed , [PER Fean  ] acknowledged that [PER Al Baghdadi  ] 's assurances might also be less than ironclad , as he made them in the same conversation in which he had pledged that only [PER Megrahi  ] 's family would greet him at the airport , a promise that clearly had not been kept . 
[PER Fean  ] also acknowledged that only [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] would make the final decision on [PER Megrahi  ] 's participation . 
6 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Mismari  ] , [PER Kusa  ] , [PER Obeidi  ] , and other officials who favor continued engagement with the [LOC West  ] are savvy operators who fully appreciate the damage caused by [PER Megrahi  ] 's high-profile reception . 
It is good to know that they are working to mitigate the effects and to prevent any further inappropriate gestures by the [MISC Libyan  ] Government . 
We believe it would be useful to share with [PER Kusa  ] and his deputy [PER Ahmed Fituri  ] a frank assessment of current sentiment in the [LOC U.S.  ] , as well as the risks to continued engagement if [PER Megrahi  ] is feted on September 1 . 
Yet while [PER Kusa  ] , [PER Mismari  ] and others play key advisory roles , only one man - [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] - will make the decision on [PER Megrahi  ] 's role on September 1.End Comment .
