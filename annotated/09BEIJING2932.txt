[LOC Beijing  ] Wants to Seize the Moment , as Does [LOC Tehran  ] --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 .

[LOC China  ] recognized the importance of seizing the present opportunity , [PER Ni  ] said , given the poor long-term prospects for [LOC Iran  ] to improve relations with the international community should progress fail to materialize in the near future . 
He said that the [MISC Iranian  ] side also understood the uniqueness of this opportunity and the importance of demonstrating progress . 
He said that [LOC Beijing  ] assessed that [LOC Iran  ] was willing to make a deal with the [LOC U.S.  ] on the nuclear issue , adding that this willingness came from the Supreme Leader , and that President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] was not the decision-maker on the issue . 
[PER Ni  ] cautioned , however , that the [MISC Iranian  ] regime remained divided over the June election and its aftermath , complicating efforts by the [MISC P5-plus-1  ] to negotiate with the regime . 
Trust-Building a Priority for [ORG PRC  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Ni  ] stressed the need at present to find ways to increase [LOC Iran  ] 's trust in the intentions of the [MISC P5-plus-1  ] .

He expressed concern that increased pressure from the international community would strengthen the consensus of hard-liners in the [MISC Iranian  ] regime . 
[PER Ni  ] reported that [MISC Iranian  ] diplomats had claimed that while they had a high degree of confidence in President [PER Obama  ] 's intentions , they remained suspicious about his ability to deliver on those intentions given political realities in the [LOC United States  ] . 
He argued that [LOC China  ] 's political efforts to persuade [LOC Iran  ] to negotiate [LOC BEIJING  ] 00002932 002 OF 002 in good faith represented an important contribution to the [MISC P5-plus-1  ] effort to deal with the nuclear issue . 
[ORG PRC Urges IAEA Cooperation  ] , [ORG Downplays Technical Progress  ] --------------------------------------------- ----------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 .

[LOC China  ] assessed that [LOC Iran  ] would allow inspectors into the [LOC Qom  ] site , [PER Ni  ] said .

He noted that of the 5,000 centrifuges in [LOC Iran  ] , less than half were actually in operation . 
[MISC Iranian  ] Side Upbeat on October 1 Meeting ---------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Ni  ] said [MISC Iranian  ] embassy contacts in [LOC Beijing  ] had expressed satisfaction with the outcomes of the October meeting in [LOC Geneva  ] , calling the event a " success . 
" Though concerned that sitting down with the [LOC U.S.  ] would be " a mistake , " the [MISC Iranians  ] had left the [MISC U.S.-Iran  ] bilateral meeting wanting to continue the process . 
[PER Ni  ] suggested that some within the [MISC Iranian  ] regime understood the need for a change in political direction , particularly after the difficult June election . 
He also reported that the [MISC Iranians  ] were putting renewed focus on creating an effective plan for economic development . 
MFA: [LOC U.S.  ] Should Incentivize , Reward [ORG Iranian Progress  ] --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) On direct [MISC U.S.-Iran  ] talks , [PER Ni  ] urged the [LOC U.S.  ] side to make a clear statement abandoning the notion of regime change . 
He suggested seeking a " cooperative partnership " with [LOC Iran  ] on shared concerns such as security in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and in doing so , recognizing [LOC Iran  ] as a major regional power . 
He recommended offering concrete and immediate benefits , especially economic incentives and a relaxation of existing sanctions , in response to positive overtures by the [MISC Iranian  ] side . 
These efforts could start small , he added , but should be focused on sending a clear signal of sincere intentions to [LOC Tehran  ] . 
[MISC Iranian Leadership Feels Street  ] Pressure on Negotiations --------------------------------------------- ----------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Ni  ] reported that based on his travel to [LOC Iran  ] , considerable debate was taking place among ordinary [MISC Iranians  ] over the utility of the nuclear program . 
Many [MISC Iranians  ] did not see the use in having nuclear technology and saw it only as a source of problems , while others saw value in the possession of nuclear technology but were reconsidering this view because of progress in talks with the [LOC United States  ] . 
In contrast , a more conservative constituency in [LOC Iran  ] was disinclined to make any concessions to the international community on the nuclear issue . 
In light of this division in society , [PER Ni  ] argued , the [MISC Iranian  ] leadership would not make concessions without meaningful and visible compensation .
