( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The successive visits of three high-level [MISC Iranian  ] officials to [LOC Damascus  ] in early December appear at first glance to reaffirm strong [MISC Iranian-Syrian  ] security ties and other forms of bilateral cooperation , but they may , in fact , mask deepening rifts over [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Yemen  ] , and the possibility of war with [LOC Israel  ] . 
[MISC Syrian  ] observers suggest the a shifting balance of power between [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Syria  ] . 
The [MISC Iranian  ] government , challenged domestically by anti-regime protests and abroad by building pressure over its nuclear program , has sought Syria’s help just when [LOC Syria  ] has begun to enjoy other strategic options , such as its relations with [LOC Turkey  ] and [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
Asad’s government proved willing to host the visits , sign a defense [LOC MOU  ] , and allow [ORG Hamas  ] Politburo Chief [PER Khaled Meshaal  ] to visit [LOC Tehran  ] , all the while continuing close cooperation with [MISC Iranian  ] security services and [ORG Hizballah  ] operatives . 
But [PER Asad  ] reportedly resisted [MISC Iranian  ] arguments for closer bilateral coordination in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Yemen  ] and flatly rejected being drawn into a war between [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Israel  ] . 
End Summary. ----------------------------------------- Reaffirmation of [MISC Staunch Syrian-Iran Ties  ] ----------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On the surface , the early-December visits of three [MISC Iranian  ] officials -- [ORG National Security Advisor Saeed Jalili  ] on December 3 , Vice President and head of the [ORG Environmental Department Mahammed-Javad Mahamadzideh  ] on December 5-6 , and Minister of [ORG Defense Ahmad  ] [PER Ali Vahidi  ] on December 8-11 -- represented a concerted reaffirmation by both countries of their strong security ties and their commitment to expanded relations . 
Set against a backdrop of rising international pressure on [LOC Iran  ] over its nuclear program and an exchange of threats between [LOC Israel  ] and [LOC Iran  ] , the visits signaled continuing cooperation in confronting [MISC Israeli  ] policies . 
[PER Asad  ] publicly praised Iran’s support for resistance against [MISC Israeli  ] occupation after his December 3 meeting with [PER Jalili  ] . 
According to the [MISC Syrian  ] press , [PER Jalili  ] also met with [MISC Palestinian  ] leaders based in [LOC Syria  ] , including [ORG Hamas  ] Politburo Chief [PER Khaled Meshaal  ] , whom he invited to visit [LOC Tehran  ] the following week . 
Though less focused on security issues , the visit of VP Mahammadzideh affirmed both countries’ commitment to expanding economic cooperation and working together on responding to climate change . 
On December 11 , [PER Vahidi  ] and his [MISC Syrian  ] counterpart , [PER Ali Habib  ] , expressed a desire for a deepening of defense and military ties , formalized in a memorandum of understanding calling for “efforts aimed at the establishment of a comprehensive regional security pact , ” and establishing recurrent meetings of the [ORG Joint Defense Cooperation Committee.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The public showcasing of these three visits contrasted with the secrecy with which [ORG Iranian Revolutionary Guard Commander/al-Quds Force  ] [PER Ghassem Soleimani  ] conducted his . 
Reportedly accompanying [PER Jalili  ] , [PER Soleimani  ] returned to [LOC Damascus  ] after a long absence , perhaps a reflection of lingering tensions between [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Syria  ] that erupted after the February 2008 assassination of [ORG Hizballah  ] military strategist [PER Imad Mugniyah  ] in the [MISC Syrian  ] capital . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] spoke very reluctantly about [MISC Soleimani’s  ] presence in [LOC Damascus  ] , saying only that “he was here , ” and “when he visits , it’s usually significant.” [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] reported seeing [PER Jalili  ] and [PER Soleimani  ] at a [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] meeting with [MISC Syrian  ] officials that included [PER FM Muallim  ] , as well as unspecified members of [LOC Hizballah.  ] “Soleimani represents the [LOC DAMASCUS  ] 00000880 002.2 OF 004 business end of the resistance , ” commented [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , also reluctant to discuss the sensitive issue of [LOC Iranian-Syrian-Hizballah  ] military cooperation. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) Taken collectively , the [MISC Iranian  ] visits over eight days were meant to dispel doubts that [LOC Syria  ] would or could abandon its ties to [LOC Iran  ] , according to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] The visits allowed the [MISC Syrian  ] government to project an image of strength at a time when [LOC Israel  ] was rejecting Syria’s demand for a commitment to withdraw to the June 4 lines and a return to [MISC Turkish-facilitated  ] proximity talks prior to moving to direct peace negotiations . 
In a joint press conference with [PER Jalili  ] , [PER FM Muallim  ] supported Iran’s right to enrich uranium and to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes . 
Moreover , the [MISC Iranian  ] visits coincided with the introduction of a law in the [ORG Knesset  ] to require a national referendum on any peace treaty. “Iran provides us diplomatic cover as well as the military might to back up our demands for peace , ” argued XXXXXXXXXXXX. “In return , we’re providing [LOC Iran  ] support when the [LOC West  ] is pressuring [LOC Iran  ] on its nuclear program , ” he said. ---------------------------------- But Did [LOC Iran  ] Wear Out Its Welcome ? ---------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) Whatever [MISC Syrian  ] rationale there may be for showcasing military ties to [LOC Iran  ] , many [MISC Syrian  ] observers are emphasizing the shifting balance of power in their bilateral relationship . 
According to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [LOC Iran  ] , not [LOC Syria  ] , sought the visits as a sign of [MISC Syrian  ] reassurance. “Be assured , ” commented [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] “they needed these visits far more than we did.” Summing up a view heard repeatedly around [LOC Damascus  ] , “things in our relations with [LOC Iran  ] are starting to return to normal” after a long period of [MISC Syrian  ] dependence , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] asserted . 
He added , “U.S. isolation and the invasion of [LOC Iraq  ] made it necessary to adopt such extreme measures . 
But now , things are moving back to equilibrium.” <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) By the time of [MISC Vahidi’s  ] visit , some [MISC Syrian  ] officials were quietly grousing that the [MISC Iranians  ] were “too needy.” The [MISC Syrian  ] government wanted to extend support to a loyal [MISC Iranian  ] ally , according to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , but the dramatic display of multiple [MISC Iranian  ] visits in a short period of time “was Iran’s doing.” The [MISC Syrian  ] government , said [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , perceived a note of panic in the [MISC Iranian  ] requests and some were saying Syria’s renewed relations with [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , its deepening ties to [LOC Turkey  ] , and even Washington’s desire to re-engage [LOC Syria  ] had made [LOC Iran  ] “jealous.” <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) While the [MISC Syrian  ] government responded positively to [MISC Iranian  ] requests for public statements of support on the nuclear issue and against [LOC Israel  ] , it remained silent after the [MISC Iranian  ] Minister of Defense’s arrival statement denounced [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , [LOC Israel  ] and the [LOC United States  ] . 
By the time [PER Vahidi  ] arrived on December 8 , press contacts noted , the [MISC Syrian  ] government’s attitude had shifted to “let’s get this over with , ” according to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
Indeed , at the same time [PER Vahidi  ] was parading his 20-car motorcade around [LOC Damascus  ] , several other visits were occurring , including one by the [MISC Turkish  ] military commandant and President [PER Sarkozy’s Middle East  ] advisors , [PER Nicolas Gallet  ] and [PER Jean-David Levitte  ] . 
Most of [ORG Presidential Media Advisor Bouthaina Shaaban’s  ] December 10 press conference was dedicated not to [MISC Syrian-Iranian  ] relations , but to Syria’s ties to other countries , according to press contactsXXXXXXXXXXXX . 
[LOC DAMASCUS  ] 00000880 003.2 OF 004 ---------------- Signs of Discord ---------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) Going beyond atmospherics [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] reported several disagreements between [MISC Jalili’s  ] delegation and their [MISC Syrian  ] counterparts . 
On [LOC Iraq  ] , [PER Jalili  ] reportedly proposed a “joining of [MISC Syrian  ] and [MISC Iranian  ] efforts” to influence the upcoming [MISC Iraqi  ] elections. “They ( the [MISC Iranians  ] ) basically asked us to focus on co-opting [ORG Shia  ] politicians and to drop our support for the [MISC Sunnis  ] and former Baathists , ” arguing that the center of gravity in [LOC Iraq  ] lies with the [ORG Shia  ] . 
On this issue [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] reported , [MISC Syrian  ] officials expressed great reluctance and continued to insist on the reintegration of former [MISC Iraqi  ] Baathists into the political system . 
Some [MISC Syrian  ] officials [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] agreed that [LOC Syria  ] needed to extend the range of its political connections in the [MISC Iraqi  ] [ORG Shia  ] community , said [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
But Iran’s vision for [LOC Iraq  ] was “a Shia-dominated state made of up of mini-states , ” an outcome the [MISC Syrian  ] government opposed , he said . 
The [ORG SARG  ] continues to desire a stronger centralized power base in [LOC Baghdad.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) On [LOC Yemen  ] , [MISC Vahidi’s  ] public remarks rebuking [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] for interfering in its neighbor’s affairs drew sharp criticism from [MISC Syrian  ] officials during the [MISC Iranian Defense  ] Minister’s meetings [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [PER Vahidi  ] was clearly trying to drive a wedge between [LOC Damascus  ] and [LOC Riyadh  ] , but “it didn’t work , ” he said . 
Asad stopped short of publicly contradicting the [MISC Iranian  ] official during his visit , but he reassured [MISC Saudi  ] King Abdullah’s son [PER Abdul Azziz  ] , in [LOC Syria  ] to pay personal condolences after the death of President Asad’s brother Majd , that [LOC Syria  ] fully supported [MISC Saudi  ] Arabia’s efforts to defeat the [ORG Huthi  ] separatists. “There weren’t any newspaper reports of [MISC Iranian  ] ministers here ( paying condolences ) , ” noted XXXXXXXXXXXX. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) More significantly , [LOC Syria  ] reportedly resisted [MISC Iranian  ] entreaties to commit to joining [LOC Iran  ] if fighting broke out between [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Israel  ] or [ORG Hizballah  ] and [LOC Israel  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [MISC Iranian  ] officials were in [LOC Syria  ] “to round up allies” in anticipation of an [MISC Israeli  ] military strike. “It ( an [MISC Israeli  ] strike on [LOC Iran  ] ) is not a matter of if , but when , ” [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , reporting what [MISC Syrian  ] officials had heard from their [MISC Iranian  ] counterparts . 
The [MISC Syrian  ] response , he continued , was to tell the [MISC Iranians  ] not to look to [LOC Syria  ] , [ORG Hizballah  ] or [ORG Hamas  ] to “fight this battle.” “We told them [LOC Iran  ] is strong enough on its own to develop a nuclear program and to fight [LOC Israel  ] , ” he said , adding , “we’re too weak.” The [MISC Iranians  ] know [LOC Syria  ] has condemned [MISC Israeli  ] threats and would denounce [MISC Israeli  ] military operations against [LOC Iran.  ] “But they were displeased with Asad’s response . 
They needed to hear the truth , ” [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) Asked what advice [LOC Syria  ] was giving [LOC Iran  ] , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] replied that [LOC Syria  ] , along with [LOC Turkey  ] and [LOC Qatar  ] , was preparing for an [MISC Israeli-Iranian  ] military exchange in the near future. “Military officials tell me they have noticed [MISC Israeli  ] drones snooping around our sites , ” he explained , noting some [MISC Syrian  ] officials saw [MISC Israeli  ] reconnaissance as an indication that [LOC Israel  ] might seek to disable anti-air radar stations as part of a plan to fly bombers over [MISC Syrian  ] territory en route to [LOC Iran.  ] “We expect to wake up one morning soon and learn the [MISC Israeli  ] strike took place . 
Then we expect an [MISC Iranian  ] response . 
At that point , we , [LOC Turkey  ] , and [LOC Qatar  ] will spring into action to begin moderating a [LOC DAMASCUS  ] 00000880 004.2 OF 004 ceasefire and then a longer-term solution involving both countries’ nuclear programs . 
That’s the best scenario . 
All the others are bad for us and the region , ” summed up XXXXXXXXXXXX. “We would hope the [LOC U.S.  ] would recognize our diplomatic efforts to resolve a regional crisis and give us some credit for playing a positive role.” ------------------ Comment: So What ? ------------------ <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) Many [MISC Syrian  ] and some diplomatic observers believe [LOC Syria  ] is in the process of re-calibrating its relations with [LOC Iran  ] and is seeking to avoid choices that would constrain the country’s flexibility as it faces an uncertain regional setting . 
Does , however , Syria’s instinct for self-survival and desire for less dependence on [LOC Iran  ] represent anything other than a shift of emphasis as long as [LOC Damascus  ] insists on maintaining its military relations with [LOC Iran  ] , [ORG Hizballah  ] , and [ORG Hamas  ] ? 
Some analysts here argue that [MISC Syria’s  ] improved relations with [LOC Turkey  ] , [LOC France  ] , and [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] afford [LOC Damascus  ] a greater range of choices in dealing with the [LOC West  ] , the [MISC Arab  ] world , [LOC Israel  ] , and [LOC Iran  ] . 
This school asserts that better ties with the [LOC U.S.  ] would further increase Syria’s range of options and its potential to move farther away from [LOC Iran  ] . 
Even if [LOC Damascus  ] and [LOC Tehran  ] maintained some semblance of their political-military relationship , the extent of their ties would be constrained by Syria’s competing equities in deepening relations with others , including the [LOC U.S.  ] Others argue that a wider range of options would only perpetuate [MISC Syria’s  ] decision-averse orientation ; if the [MISC Iranians  ] can’t pin down [LOC Syria  ] on matters of war and peace , then what chance would the [LOC United States  ] have ? 
[LOC Syria  ] could pocket openings offered by [LOC Washington  ] and simply use our gestures to play rivals off one another. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) At the end of the day , it may be impossible to assess Syria’s intentions with any confidence until the regional context becomes clearer . 
In the meantime , the [LOC U.S.  ] should take a modicum of quiet satisfaction that [LOC Syria  ] is showing signs of wanting to moderate Iran’s influence in its affairs , even though expecting the relationship to end altogether remains unrealistic . 
If [MISC Syria’s  ] improved relations with [LOC France  ] , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] and [LOC Turkey  ] can initiate cracks in the [MISC Syrian-Iranian  ] axis , then perhaps discrete [MISC U.S.-Syrian  ] cooperation could add further stress to these fault lines . 
A willingness to offer concrete deliverables as evidence of a [LOC U.S.  ] desire for improved relations would force [MISC Syrian  ] officials to calculate how far they would go in response , providing us with a more accurate measure of their intentions . 
At a minimum , increased [LOC Washington  ] interest in [LOC Syria  ] would increase Tehran’s anxiety level and perhaps compound [MISC Syrian-Iranian  ] tensions , at a time when [MISC Syrian  ] officials themselves may be unsure how they will react to unfolding events .
