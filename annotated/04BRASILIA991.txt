( C ) Summary . 
With introduction of the Friends of [LOC Haiti  ] draft resolution to the [ORG UNSC  ] for discussion and a probable vote this week , [LOC Brazil  ] is at an important stage in its planning to deploy a [ORG PKO  ] mission . 
Major issues on the scope now are internal political dynamics , congress' role and operational planning . 
Once the [ORG UN  ] resolution passes , the executive plan for the deployment should move quickly to congress , where the [ORG GOB  ] 's solid majority and historic precedent suggest relatively quick approval , despite the possibility of some debate . 
Budget issues are looming large as a prime area of concern . 
The [ORG GOB  ] also needs to speed up its sluggish military operational planning , including committing to send representatives to [ORG UN  ] military coordination meetings and offering greater clarity on what equipment and support their forces may need from us . 
End summary . 
MRE AND [ORG UN  ] STATUS <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG PolCouns  ] discussed ref a demarche points and [LOC Haiti  ] developments with [ORG Foreign Ministry UN Division  ] Chief [PER Carlos Duarte  ] on 20 and again on 23 April . 
[PER Duarte  ] said that [LOC Brazil  ] 's delegation in [LOC New York  ] has been working with the [LOC U.S.  ] and other Friends ( [LOC Canada  ] , [LOC France  ] , [LOC Chile  ] ) to craft a resolution text that will help facilitate [LOC Brazil  ] 's deployment , even if the resolution 's mandate is under Chapter VII . 
[PER Duarte  ] also said that , following release of the [ORG UN  ] assessment team 's report on 20 April , [LOC Brazil  ] 's [LOC New York  ] delegation had been approached " on an urgent basis " by the [ORG UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations  ] ( [ORG UNDPKO  ] ) , requesting details asap on [LOC Brazil  ] 's contribution and urging closer liaison with the [ORG UNDPKO  ] . 
PRESIDENCY <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Marcel Biato  ] ( protect ) , President [PER Lula da Silva  ] 's deputy foreign affairs advisor , confirmed to [ORG PolCouns  ] on 26 April that the joint [MISC MRE-MOD  ] message detailing [LOC Brazil  ] 's deployment plan is on [PER Lula  ] 's desk . 
[PER Biato  ] opined that [PER Lula  ] would sign off on the deployment plan and move it quickly to congress when the resolution passes . 
That said , [PER Biato  ] indicated that budget questions are looming large in [LOC Planalto  ] 's consideration of the deployment and likely would be a focal point of any debates within the executive branch , congress or the press . 
[PER Biato  ] said that the [ORG GOB  ] is estimating a cost of about USD 50 million for the deployment . 
He pointed out that is roughly the amount of funding [PER Lula  ] may release on an emergency basis to [MISC Brazilian  ] states for spending on public security -- a hot issue in the wake of a recent explosion of organized criminal violence in [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] . 
( Note: Although the [ORG UN  ] reimburses on most costs of the [ORG PKO  ] , the lag between disbursal of funds by the [ORG GOB  ] and reimbursement affects budget decisions in the near term . 
End note . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG PolCouns  ] noted to [PER Biato  ] a recent speech by [PER Lula  ] in which the president insisted that [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG PKO  ] contribution be viewed as part of a broad international commitment to social and economic development in [LOC Haiti  ] . 
[PER Biato  ] replied that [PER Lula  ] 's support for the deployment remains robust . 
However , along with concerns noted above about costs and priorities , the [ORG GOB  ] may have to deal with other domestic criticisms of the deployment , including questions about [PER Aristide  ] 's departure and leftist charges ( including from within [PER Lula  ] 's [ORG PT  ] party ) that the deployment will bolster [MISC American  ] " hegemony . 
" [PER Biato  ] said [PER Lula  ] needs to show the [ORG PKO  ] fits in with the [ORG GOB  ] 's vision of global social development , and [PER Biato  ] said that language in the current Friends of [LOC Haiti  ] resolution draft should help with that concern . 
CONGRESS' ROLE <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Under widely-accepted interpretations of [LOC Brazil  ] 's 1988 Constitution , the congress must approve the overseas deployment of [MISC Brazilian  ] military forces . 
The [MISC MRE-MOD  ] joint message , once signed off by [PER Lula  ] , will be sent to the [ORG Congress  ] in the form of an " explanation of motives " ( " explicacao dos motivos " ) . 
A budget request for the plan is included . 
The executive branch measure goes first to the lower house , the [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] , where the [ORG Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee  ] will assign a sponsor ( " relator " ) who redrafts the executive document into a bill ( " projeto do lei " ) . 
The [ORG Foreign Affairs Committee  ] considers and votes the bill out to the plenary for approval , and that secured , the bill moves to the [ORG Senate  ] . 
Following examination by the [ORG Senate Foreign Affairs Committee  ] , there is a [ORG Senate  ] plenary vote . 
In this case , the bill will almost certainly be placed on the congress' " urgent " track , where it can by-pass other legislation , and the entire congressional process can be completed in a matter of several days , if debate does not stall progress. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Senator [PER Eduardo Suplicy  ] , chairman of the [ORG Senate  ] [ORG Foreign Affairs Committee  ] , told poloff last week that [LOC Brazil  ] 's congress had never rejected an executive branch proposal for overseas deployment of [MISC Brazilian  ] forces . 
Indeed , while the budget questions and some of the domestic criticisms noted above may well surface in [LOC Brazil  ] 's congress , the government 's solid majority in both houses and historic precedent strongly suggest the measure will pass , and relatively quickly . 
[ORG MOD  ] - SLUGGISH OPERATIONAL PLANNING <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The factors above point to a window of one to two weeks from the time the [ORG UN  ] resolution passes until the [ORG GOB  ] gives the final go-ahead for a deployment . 
However , it is not clear that [MISC Brazilian  ] military planning is moving ahead in a manner that would will facilitate rapid deployment once the political order is given . 
Repeated Mission [ORG MLO  ] Chief queries in the past several days to [MISC Brazilian  ] military planners suggest the military establishment is moving at a sluggish pace . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] military sources told [ORG MLO  ] chief that only after a resolution is passed and [LOC Brazil  ] 's congress approves a deployment will the military commit to sending representatives to [ORG UNDPKO  ] operational planning meetings ( such as the one scheduled for [LOC Haiti  ] on 2-7 May . 
) In addition , despite Defense Minister [PER Viegas'  ] request for support and transfer of [LOC U.S.  ] equipment to [MISC Brazilian  ] forces that deploy to [LOC Haiti  ] ( ref B ) , [MISC Brazilian  ] liaison officers have yet to indicate when or if the [ORG GOB  ] will sign an [ORG ACSA  ] agreement to facilitate [LOC U.S.  ] logistical support to [MISC Brazilian  ] forces , and the [ORG MOD  ] has not yet provided a list of specific requirements for equipment. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) In one effort to accelerate progress , [ORG SOUTHCOM  ] J-4 and [MISC Brazilian  ] liaison have compiled ( on 26 April ) a working list of equipment that [MISC Brazilian  ] forces may require in [LOC Haiti  ] , for DOD to determine whether the items can be made available for purchase to [LOC Brazil  ] . 
( Note: [LOC Brazil  ] army contacts indicate to [ORG MLO  ] chief that [LOC Brazil  ] has USD 400 thousand available in an FMS account . 
End note . 
) DOD and [ORG SOUTHCOM  ] are also pursuing information on availability of equipment from the [ORG UN  ] . 
Mission DAO is also providing situation reports to the [ORG MOD  ] , and has offered secure communication equipment for intelligence sharing. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Comment . 
Possible debate about the budget issue and an evident lack of speed in military planning appear to be the main challenges in the weeks ahead to deployment of [MISC Brazilian  ] forces to [LOC Haiti  ] . 
While these are obstacles , the continued commitment of the [ORG GOB  ] to the operation , the political force the [PER Lula  ] government enjoys in congress and a certain native [MISC Brazilian  ] talent for pulling complex projects together in competent fashion at the last minute suggest [PER DefMin Viegas'  ] timeline of a late June deployment for the bulk of forces ( ref C ) is possible and likely . 
Nonetheless , we should continue to encourage the [ORG GOB  ] to participate in crucial military planning now , to sign an [ORG ACSA  ] agreement to facilitate operational support , and we should be proactive in identifying equipment that could be transferred to [MISC Brazilian  ] units in [LOC Haiti  ] .
