( C ) Minister of [ORG Defense Nelson Jobim  ] will travel to [LOC Norfolk  ] and [LOC Washington  ] from March 18-22 , 2008 on a counterpart visit . 
He will meet with Secretary [PER Gates  ] in an office call on March 20 June . 
Minister [PER Jobim  ] , s objectives for the visit are to enhance prospects for bilateral cooperation and explore possibilities for access to [LOC U.S.  ] defense technology. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Summary: Minister [PER Jobim  ] is the first strong Minister of [ORG Defense in Brazil  ] . 
He is working to centralize civilian oversight of the [MISC Brazilian  ] military and hopes to learn from the [LOC U.S.  ] military in this regard . 
He has also clearly indicated a desire to pursue military cooperation agreements despite objections from the [ORG Ministry for External Affairs  ] , such as in the case of concluding a [ORG SOFA  ] with [LOC France  ] . 
He has also expressed his desire to pursue a [ORG Defense Cooperation Agreement  ] with the [LOC U.S.  ] and to have it approved directly by the President . 
[PER Jobim  ] has also been helpful in making progress on a General Security of [ORG Information Agreement  ] , which requires approval by [LOC Brazil  ] , s [ORG Ministry of Interior and Office for Institutional Security  ] . 
Although the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] share the basic goals of fostering hemispheric stability , preventing terrorist activity and strengthening international non-proliferation regimes , [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] cooperation is hindered by difficulties in completing a bilateral defense cooperation agreement , providing protections for [LOC U.S.  ] personnel involved in training and joint exercises and taking proactive steps to address countries of proliferation concern such as [LOC Iran  ] . 
[LOC Brazil  ] has maintained its leadership role in the [LOC Haiti  ] peacekeeping force [MISC MINUSTAH  ] under the active advocacy of the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] . 
[PER Jobim  ] , s visit comes at an important time as [LOC Brazil  ] is formulating a new [ORG National Defense Strategy  ] and beginning to make decisions about acquisition of new military systems and technology . 
Other military issues of interest include service relations with the fledgling civilian defense ministry and the necessity of negotiating further agreements with the [LOC U.S.  ] in order to enhance our already strong military-to-military relationship . 
End Summary. -------------------------- [MISC Politico-Economic  ] Overview -------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) President [PER Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  ] was elected in 2002 in large part on promises of promoting an ambitious social agenda , including generous handouts to the poor . 
On the strength of the popularity of these measures , he was re-elected in 2006 , although with diminished support from the middle class . 
The public 's top concerns - crime and public security - have not improved under this administration . 
The [ORG Lula Administration  ] has been beset by a grave political crisis as interlocking influence peddling/vote-buying scandals plagued elements of [PER Lula  ] 's [MISC PT  ] party , but the President , s personal popularity has not suffered , even after many of his closest associates have been caught in corrupt practices . 
MOD [PER Jobim  ] is perhaps among the most trusted leaders in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
A former [ORG Supreme Court Justice  ] , he maintains a strong reputation for integrity that is rare among [LOC Brazil  ] , s leadership. --------------------------------------------- -- [ORG Friendly Cooperation  ] , But Not Strong Friendship --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [LOC Brazil  ] 's democratic institutions are strong and stable after more than 20 years of civilian rule . 
A return to military dictatorship is today unthinkable as [LOC Brazil  ] 's armed forces pursue a professional non-political identity . 
With steady export-led economic growth having become the norm in the recent past , [LOC Brazil  ] has been a supporter of reasoned foreign policy goals and has been steadfast in its support of democracy in the hemisphere . 
It has a strong interest in hemispheric security issues that largely mirrors our own , and actively cooperates with us on the operational level in the fight against terrorism . 
[LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000351 002.2 OF 003 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) While relations between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] are generally friendly , often the USG encounters major difficulties in gaining the cooperation of senior policymakers on issues of significant interest to the [LOC United States  ] . 
The difficulty is most apparent in the [ORG Ministry for External Affairs  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) which maintains an anti-American slant and has tried to block improved [MISC DoD-MOD  ] relations . 
In planning for [PER Jobim  ] , s visit , the [ORG MRE  ] actively campaigned to limit [PER Jobim  ] , s time in [LOC Washington  ] to one largely ceremonial day with little substance. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The current left-of-center administration has studiously avoided close cooperation on pol-mil issues important to us and has kept us at arms length on most security-related issues . 
Specifically , the [ORG MRE  ] has dragged its feet on completing a [ORG Defense Cooperation Agreement  ] , General Security of [ORG Military Information Agreement  ] ( [ORG GSOMIA  ] ) , [ORG Acquisition  ] and [ORG Cross Servicing Agreement  ] ( [ORG ACSA  ] ) or Article 98 agreement . 
The [ORG GOB  ] traditionally maintained that such agreements , particularly the [ORG SOFA  ] , were against [MISC Brazilian  ] law , but reversed itself ( over [ORG MRE  ] objections ) and signed a [ORG SOFA  ] with [LOC France  ] earlier this year . 
We are exploring the possibility of using the [MISC French  ] [ORG SOFA  ] as a starting place for a [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] agreement. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [LOC Brazil  ] has stayed the course as leader of [MISC MINUSTAH  ] in [LOC Haiti  ] despite a lack of domestic support for the [ORG PKO  ] . 
The [ORG MRE  ] has remained committed to the initiative because it believes that the operation serves [PER FM Amorim  ] 's obsessive international goal of qualifying [LOC Brazil  ] for a seat on the [ORG UN Security Council  ] . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] military remains committed as well , because the mission enhances its international prestige and provides training and operational opportunities . 
So far , President [PER Lula  ] has backed the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] 's position , and [LOC Brazil  ] will likely continue to provide leadership and troops to [MISC MINUSTAH  ] for the conceivable future . 
Despite the success of the [MISC MINUSTAH  ] deployment , [LOC Brazil  ] has not shown any interest in undertaking further peacekeeping operations , although [MISC Brazilian  ] contributions to [ORG UN  ] operations in such places as Darfur have been requested. ------------------------ [LOC CT  ] and [LOC Non-Proliferation  ] ------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The desire not to be identified with the [LOC U.S.  ] is borne out as well in the [ORG GOB  ] 's approach to counterterrorism . 
Cooperation remains excellent at the operational level , especially between law enforcement agencies . 
However , the [ORG GOB  ] political leadership has refused to endorse [LOC U.S.  ] counterterrorism initiatives publicly and has insisted that official communiques of the 3 1 mechanism note that there is no evidence of terrorist operations in the Tri-Border area , where [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Paraguay  ] and [LOC Argentina  ] meet . 
Wary of its large , prosperous and influential [MISC Arab  ] population , the [ORG GOB  ] makes every effort to downplay in public even the possibility of terrorist fund-raising going on inside [LOC Brazil.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOB  ] has a good record in non-proliferation efforts , but has been slow to join international consensus in favor of sanctions on [LOC Iran  ] . 
[LOC Brazil  ] has also not yet signed the [MISC NPT Additional Protocol  ] , although it has not ruled out signing it in the near future. --------------- [ORG Military Issues  ] --------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [LOC Brazil  ] established a [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] ( [ORG MoD  ] ) for the first time in June 1999 , uniting the three services ( Army , [ORG Navy  ] , and [ORG Air Force  ] ) under a single minister . 
[PER Jobim  ] became Minister last year when the disastrous crash of a [MISC Brazilian  ] airliner highlighted weaknesses in the civil aviation system , which comes under [ORG MOD  ] purview . 
Organizationally , the [ORG MOD  ] still faces challenges managing the individual services . 
Each service is still fairly autonomous and controls its own budget and acquisition programs . 
In addition , the [PER Lula  ] administration , s focus on social reforms [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000351 003.2 OF 003 and programs has meant decreases for military budgets , leading to fewer training opportunities and equipment purchases . 
This situation is changing as there is now near consensus among [LOC Brazil  ] , s leadership that the military is under-resourced and under equipped to accomplish its missions. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) To address this situation , the [PER Lula  ] government has tasked a new [ORG National Defense  ] strategy to be completed by this fall . 
This paper will set the framework for military modernization and theoretically drive decisions on acquisition of new equipment . 
In reality , such decisions will be made largely for political and economic reasons . 
[LOC Brazil  ] , s defense industrial base has atrophied since the end of the [MISC Cold War  ] , and it is a major objective of the government to reinvigorate it . 
Decisions on major systems will be influenced much more by access to foreign technology and opportunities for [MISC Brazilian  ] industry than by the capabilities such systems will add to [LOC Brazil  ] , s military. ---------------------- General Points to Make ---------------------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Our core message for [PER Jobim  ] 's visit should be: -- Reinforcing and underscoring the importance of these agreements in support of [LOC Brazil  ] , s interest to reequip and modernize its military with technology transfer is critically important . 
It would also help to define how we , the anchor of the [LOC North America  ] , and [LOC Brazil  ] the anchor of [LOC South America  ] , may be able to work more closely in the future to enhance hemispheric defense cooperation . 
We recommend SecDef also emphasize the following points in conversations with Minister [PER Jobim:  ] -- We want to continue improving our defense relationship . 
This is an imperative , given the difficult global security situation in which we live today , and the importance of [LOC Brazil  ] , s role in the [LOC Americas  ] . 
-- We are serious about our partnership in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
We see strong possibilities for joint research and production , exchanges of military personnel and training . 
-- As you make important decisions about the modernization of [LOC Brazil  ] , s forces later this year , keep in mind that partnership with the [LOC U.S.  ] can help both our countries realize our common goal of preserving stability in the [LOC Western Hemisphere  ] . 
-- As we continue to develop our partnership , we need to have in place several standard documents to assure smooth cooperation . 
The [ORG Defense Cooperation Agreement  ] is the first of these . 
We understand your Ministry has approved the current draft and hope the rest of your government will also . 
Next , we hope to complete an agreement on information security and a [ORG Status of Forces Agreement  ] to protect the forces of both countries during joint exercises . 
-- The [LOC United States  ] would like to congratulate [LOC Brazil  ] for its efforts in [LOC Haiti  ] . 
The improving situation there is in no small measure due to the professionalism and dedication of [MISC Brazilian  ] troops and leadership . 
We hope [LOC Brazil  ] is resolved to continue to contribute to the success of [MISC MINUSTAH  ] .
