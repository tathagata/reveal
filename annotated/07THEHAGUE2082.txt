TWO MORE YEARS IN [MISC URUZGAN Classified  ] By: [ORG CDA  ] [PER Andrew Schofer  ] , reasons 1.4 ( b , d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: The [ORG GONL  ] obtained broad support on December 20 from the [MISC Dutch  ] parliament in favor of extending its [ORG ISAF  ] mission in [LOC Uruzgan  ] province until December 2010 . 
This officially brings to a close months of internal [MISC Dutch  ] deliberations on the controversial extension issue , and ensures that the [MISC Dutch  ] troops will remain committed to [LOC Uruzgan  ] for the next three years despite serious political misgivings and a lack of popular support at home . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The [MISC Dutch  ] parliament on December 20 officially gave its consent to an additional two-year plus extension of its [ORG ISAF  ] mission in [LOC Uruzgan  ] from August 2008 until December 2010 , voting down by a count of 98 to 42 ( with 10 absences ) a motion by the [ORG Socialist Party  ] to withdraw troops at the end of the current mandate . 
While parliament does not constitutionally have the authority to approve any [MISC Dutch  ] deployment overseas -- and votes represented in parliament by the coalition parties technically gave the [ORG GONL  ] a majority -- the [ORG GONL  ] nevertheless stressed the political importance of garnering broad support for the mission . 
( Note: According to [MISC Dutch  ] Parliamentary tradition , members planning to be absent from an important vote " " twin " " with a member from the opposing side . 
Had all members been present , therefore , the vote would have been 103 in favor to 47 against -- slightly more than a two-thirds majority . 
End note . 
) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [ORG GONL  ] obtained this broad support when the opposition [ORG Liberal Party  ] ( [ORG VVD  ] ) and [ORG Political Calvinist Party  ] ( [ORG SGP  ] ) joined coalition parties the [ORG Christian Democratic Alliance  ] ( [ORG CDA  ] ) , the [ORG Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) , and [ORG Christian Unie  ] ( [ORG CU  ] ) . 
As the largest and most influential opposition party on the right , [ORG VVD  ] 's support was crucial . 
Throughout the debate , [ORG VVD Foreign Affairs  ] spokesperson [PER Hans van Baalen  ] consistently asked the [ORG GONL  ] to justify the new mission in terms of improved structure , financing , new contributions from other partners , sufficient transport and Allied support to extract [MISC Dutch  ] troops in case of an emergency , and clarity of the [MISC Afghan  ] government 's promise to deploy security forces to [LOC Uruzgan.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Despite [ORG GONL  ] efforts to satisfy van [PER Baalen  ] 's concerns , [ORG VVD  ] 's support for the new mission was not assured until the parliamentary debate over the extension on December 17 . 
Former Defense Minister and still influential [ORG VVD  ] parliamentarian [PER Henk Kamp  ] insisted on upholding the original agreement between [ORG NATO  ] and the [LOC Netherlands  ] consisting of a two-year deployment to August 2008 -- as indicated by a December 2005 letter from former [ORG SACEUR Gen. Jones  ] to [MISC Dutch  ] CHOD Gen. Berlijn . 
Key demands for [ORG VVD  ] 's continued support included a clear exit by [MISC Dutch  ] troops from [LOC Uruzgan  ] by December 2010 and recognition by [ORG NATO  ] that it is responsible for finding a successor to the [MISC Dutch  ] , as well as the understanding that the [ORG GONL  ] will not participate in any other major peacekeeping operation until 2010 . 
Ultimately , van [PER Baalen  ] was satisfied by the [ORG GONL  ] 's case to remain in [LOC Uruzgan  ] -- including especially the promise that new or unforeseen costs associated with the extension would not affect the defense budget -- and pledged his party 's unanimous support . 
Strong Government Case ---------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) During three rounds of parliamentary debate on December 17-18 , the [ORG GONL  ] confidently pitched the case in favor of extending , answering 577 questions submitted by parliament on the matter . 
FM [PER Verhagen  ] said he had received a letter from [ORG NATO  ] SYG de [PER Hoop Scheffer  ] acknowledging that [MISC Dutch  ] troops will leave [LOC Uruzgan  ] by December 2010 . 
[PER Verhagen  ] reiterated that he informed his counterparts at the [ORG NATO  ] foreign ministerial on December 10 the [MISC Dutch  ] would withdraw by December 2010 . 
He also made clear that the [LOC Netherlands  ] would not participate in any other major operation that might affect the [MISC Dutch  ] deployment in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Verhagen  ] stressed the importance of the international community reviewing its collective long-term efforts in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , including specifically a " " master strategy " " -- he said this will be discussed at the upcoming [ORG NATO  ] summit in [LOC Bucharest.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Defense Minister [PER van Middelkoop  ] argued that the extended mission will not harm [MISC Dutch  ] military readiness , and made several reassurances regarding the [MISC Australian  ] partnership and the quality of various contributions from [LOC France  ] , [LOC Slovakia  ] , the [LOC Czech Republic  ] , and [LOC Hungary  ] . 
He had hoped for additional partners , but did not foresee any problems working with these contributions , and suggested that the [LOC Czech Republic  ] might be willing to extend its parliamentary mandated six-month deployment to a year . 
[PER Van Middelkoop  ] was confident that the [ORG GONL  ] could finance the new mission , including 370 million [MISC Euros  ] of additional funding per year . 
Development Minister [PER Koenders  ] made the case in favor of meaningful reconstruction despite the challenging security situation . 
He noted that the [LOC Uruzgan  ] PRT would be placed under civilian leadership by August 1 , 2009 . 
Opposing View ------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The Socialists and [ORG Green Left  ] led the charge opposing the extension , arguing that parliament was deliberately misled to support a " " combat " " mission in the guise of reconstruction . 
[ORG Green Left  ] floorleader [PER Halsema  ] argued that the [ORG ISAF  ] mission -- in conjunction with OEF -- has enabled a corrupt [ORG Karzai  ] government , and has been responsible for unnecessary civilian casualties . 
[PER Geert Wilders  ] and his [ORG Party for Freedom  ] ( [ORG PVV  ] ) also opposed the mission , but for different reasons . 
[PER Wilders  ] said he supported the [ORG ISAF  ] mission , but felt that the [LOC Netherlands  ] had " " done its fair share " " -- time for another [PER Ally  ] to step up and serve in the south . 
The [ORG GONL  ] had hoped to persuade [MISC D-66  ] to join proponents of the extension , but [MISC D-66  ] floorleader Pechtold cited the absence of a clear strategy among [ORG NATO  ] , the [ORG UN  ] , and the [ORG EU  ] as the main reason why he opposes a new mission. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) In all , the [ORG Socialist Party  ] ( [ORG SP  ] ) , [ORG Green Left  ] , [ORG PVV  ] , D66 and the [ORG Party for the Animals  ] opposed the mission . 
Opposition actually grew in comparison to the initial mission , due primarily to election gains by the Socialists and [ORG Green Left  ] in the last election , and votes lost by [ORG VVD  ] to [PER Wilders'  ] [ORG PVV  ] off-shoot . 
Opposition parties sponsored four total motions on the extension: withdrawing [MISC Dutch  ] troops by August 2008 ( [ORG SP  ] ) , conveying disappointment to [ORG NATO  ] over perceived lack of support ( [ORG SP  ] ) , publicly releasing the December 2005 letter from former [ORG SACEUR Gen. Jones  ] to Gen. Berlijn ( [MISC D-66  ] ) , and calling for better compensation for victims of civilian casualties ( [ORG Green Left  ] ) -- all four motions were voted down . 
[PER Rita Verdonk  ] , who until recently had been a member of [ORG VVD  ] , also voted against the extension . 
Something All Could [MISC Agree On  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Parties all across the political spectrum expressed deep dissatisfaction with [ORG NATO  ] and the lack of solidarity in supporting the [MISC Dutch  ] extension in [LOC Uruzgan  ] . 
Proponents of the extension were quick to thank the [MISC French  ] , [MISC Czechs  ] , [MISC Slovaks  ] , [MISC Hungarians  ] and [MISC Georgians  ] , but questioned why other [MISC Allies  ] had not agreed to do more . 
[ORG PvdA  ] spokesperson [PER Martijn van Daam  ] noted disappointment with [ORG NATO  ] partners ; [ORG VVD  ] spokesperson van [PER Baalen  ] called on greater [MISC Allies  ] powers -- such as [LOC Germany  ] -- to do more . 
Critics made the perceived lack of [ORG NATO  ] solidarity a centerpiece in their opposition to the extension . 
[PER Wilders  ] based his decision solely on this point ; [MISC D-66  ] spokesperson Pechtold described the lack of solidarity as damaging for [ORG NATO  ] , and creates a false sense of security for the people of [LOC Uruzgan  ] . 
The Socialists accused [ORG NATO  ] of " " not keeping its part of the bargain , " " as evidenced by the [MISC Jones-Berlijn  ] letter . 
Public Opinion -------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Despite the broad support in parliament , [MISC Dutch  ] public support for the extension remains low . 
According to the latest opinion polls , 43 percent oppose any extension , approximately 25 percent are in favor , with the remaining almost 33 percent feeling indifferent. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [MISC Dutch  ] media coverage has been mixed , largely ignoring the extension story once it became clear the [ORG GONL  ] would obtain a strong parliamentary majority . 
Most major dailies focused on the latest developments in the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG Hell  ] 's [ORG Angels  ] trial or [MISC Dutch  ] soccer team [ORG AZ  ] 's loss in [MISC UEFA Cup  ] play . 
[MISC Dutch  ] daily [ORG Trouw  ] ( center-left ) welcomed the extension , accused [PER Wilders'  ] of political opportunism , and deplored [MISC D-66  ] 's opposition in light of its long international tradition . 
The [ORG Trouw  ] editorial suggested that stabilizing [LOC Afghanistan  ] is a long-term effort , and therefore questioned [ORG GONL  ] 's decision to " " call it a day " " in 2010 . 
It criticized the [ORG GONL  ] for " " operating clumsily , " " while [ORG NATO  ] Allies demonstrated " " little solidarity " " with the [LOC Netherlands.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Dutch  ] newspaper [ORG NRC Handelsblad  ] ( center-left ) called for tempered expectations in the next two years , especially as " " not much " " has come from reconstruction efforts thus far . 
This editorial highlighted the importance of adopting an [LOC Afghanistan  ] " " master plan " " at the [ORG NATO  ] summit in [LOC Bucharest  ] . 
[MISC Dutch  ] daily [ORG Telegraaf  ] ( center-right ; largest circulation in [LOC Netherlands  ] ) supports the extension , and published holiday wishes from most members of Cabinet on its front page , emphasizing support and respect for [MISC Dutch  ] soldiers serving in [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) FM [PER Verhagen  ] acknowledged that the wide support in parliament for the extension is not reflected in the [MISC Dutch  ] population -- " " at times , ( parliament 's ) views will not reflect the opinion of a majority of the population . 
" " He said he will focus on generating broader [MISC Dutch  ] public support for the extension . 
Comment: Two Years is Two Years ? -------------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) For all the drama ( public flubs by van [LOC Middelkoop  ] and Berlijn ) and delays ( [ORG GONL  ] assurances that the decision would be complete by what seemed like an endless summer ) associated with this extension question , the [ORG GONL  ] once again did a masterful job of forcing a difficult decision with low public support through the [MISC Dutch  ] parliament on a tight schedule . 
A key point in gaining the support of many parliamentarians was the promise that [MISC Dutch  ] troops will leave [LOC Uruzgan  ] by December <a id='par2010' href='#par2010'>¶</a>2010 . 
However , the [ORG GONL  ] decision mentions nothing of possible [MISC Dutch  ] missions in other [MISC Afghan  ] provinces , or a continued [MISC Dutch  ] civilian presence in [LOC Uruzgan  ] . 
According to MFA [ORG Task Force Uruzgan Coordinator  ] [PER Pieter-Jan Kleiweg  ] on December 21 , " " the door purposefully remains open " " -- and a lot can happen in two years time .
