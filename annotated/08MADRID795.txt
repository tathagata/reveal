( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG SUMMARY:  ] The [ORG DCM  ] paid a farewell call on [MISC Spanish  ] Secretary of State for [ORG IberoAmerican Affairs Trinidad Jimenez  ] on July 1 and took the opportunity to exchange views on recent events in the [LOC Western Hemisphere  ] . 
The meeting was substantive and lasted well over an hour . 
The two discussed FM Moratinos 's June 17-18 visit to [LOC Colombia  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] and [PER Jimenez  ] 's trip to [LOC Ecuador  ] , ongoing protests in [LOC Argentina  ] , opportunities for the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Spain  ] to collaborate with [LOC Mexico  ] and Central [MISC American  ] countries on security issues , and [LOC Cuba  ] . 
As usual , [PER Jimenez  ] was cordial and open , and although aware of the challenges facing [LOC Latin America  ] , was overall optimistic about the medium-term prospects in the region . 
Reviewing our shared goals , both Secretary of State [PER Jimenez  ] and the [ORG DCM  ] were hopeful for future opportunities for [MISC U.S.-Spanish  ] engagement in the region , including the next [ORG Working Group  ] which [PER Jimenez  ] hoped would take place in September on the margins of the [ORG UNGA  ] . 
End summary. //The [ORG Merida Initiative//  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG DCM  ] opened by stressing the importance of the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Spain  ] working together to support democracy by seeking ways to strengthen the rule of law and promote judicial reform in [LOC Latin America  ] . 
The [ORG DCM  ] cited Foreign Affairs Secretary of State [PER Angel Lossada  ] 's June 26 meetings in [LOC Washington  ] with the Deputy Secretary and with [ORG WHA A/S Shannon  ] . 
[PER Jimenez  ] said [PER Lossada  ] had briefed her on these meetings . 
She agreed that judicial reform and rule of law were vital issues in the region and had a prominent place in [LOC EU  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] development portfolios in [MISC Latin American  ] countries . 
She stressed [LOC Spain  ] 's continuing future resource commitment in this area and promised to provide us with a portfolio of these kinds of projects throughout the region . 
In response to the [ORG DCM  ] 's brief , she was extremely positive about the [LOC U.S.  ] effort to further increase support for [MISC Mexican  ] and Central [MISC American  ] efforts to fight drug trafficking and organized crime through the [ORG Merida Initiative  ] . 
She cited the critical importance for the region of President [PER Calderon  ] 's success in his tenacious fight against the drug bands . 
[PER Jimenez  ] expressed great concern about the deteriorating situation in Central [LOC America  ] and agreed that making headway against corruption and crime were critical to restoring stability in the region. //Recovering " Formality " with [LOC Venezuela  ] , et al// <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Asked about Foreign Minister Moratinos 's June trip to [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Colombia  ] , [PER Jimenez  ] responded that [LOC Spain  ] 's purpose had been to " recover a certain formality " and to diminish tensions before the next [ORG IberoAmerican Summit  ] , in which the [MISC Spanish  ] King will participate . 
[PER Jimenez  ] said that in this visit [PER Chavez  ] had been unusually moderate , avoiding rhetorical excesses , and expressing interest in normalizing relations with [LOC Spain  ] . 
She described the principal issues on the agenda as bilateral and principally related to supporting [MISC Spanish  ] business interests and ensuring the protection of [MISC Spanish  ] citizen properties in [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
[PER Jimenez  ] described [PER Chavez  ] as " a brute , but not a stupid one . 
" [PER Chavez  ] recognized that having lost the December 2007 referendum , his leadership position had been weakened . 
She said that Moratinos had invited [PER Chavez  ] to [LOC Spain  ] , in connection with a trip by [PER Chavez  ] to the [LOC Water Expo  ] in [LOC Zaragoza  ] , in an effort to smooth over relations between the King and [PER Chavez  ] -- an effort the King supported . 
( Embassy Comment: We understand that [PER Chavez  ] is scheduled to visit [LOC Spain  ] on/about July 21 . 
The media report he will meet with King [PER Juan Carlos  ] I on July 25 in [LOC Palma de Mallorca  ] , and will come to Madrid the same day to meet with President [PER Zapatero  ] . 
) The [ORG DCM  ] raised [LOC U.S.  ] concerns about [PER Chavez  ] and particularly his growing ties with [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Jimenez  ] agreed that [LOC Venezuela  ] 's relations with [LOC Iran  ] needed to be monitored , but noted that ultimately the two countries did not have much in common because of culture and the fact that both were principally energy exporters . 
She hastened somewhat naively to point out that despite economic dealings with [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Venezuela  ] 's economic ties with the [LOC U.S.  ] would remain paramount . 
The [ORG DCM  ] stressed the importance of [LOC Spain  ] 's not selling arms or weapons systems to [LOC Venezuela  ] , which would send destabilizing signals around the region. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Regarding the state of relations between [LOC Venezuela  ] , [LOC Colombia  ] , and [LOC Ecuador  ] since the early March border conflict , [PER Jimenez  ] stated that despite the huge political differences between [PER Chavez  ] and [PER Uribe  ] , paradoxically in the past both Presidents actually had developed a measure of personal rapport . 
Certainly , national interest suggested that both nations needed to maintain good relations . 
She cited the fact that [LOC Venezuela  ] was very dependent on [LOC Colombia  ] as its principal supplier of foodstuffs , a fact that [PER Chavez  ] appeared mindful of at a time that [LOC Venezuela  ] faced severe food shortages . 
[PER Jimenez  ] insisted that [PER Uribe  ] had even managed to maintain open lines of communication with [LOC Cuba  ] 's [PER Fidel Castro  ] , developed over the years and related to peace talks with the [ORG ELN  ] . 
The biggest problem in this diplomatic jigsaw , according to [PER Jimenez  ] , was the poor state of relations between [LOC Ecuador  ] and [LOC Colombia  ] , and personally between President [PER Correa  ] and President [PER Uribe  ] . 
[PER Jimenez  ] described as excellent Foreign Minister [PER Moratinos  ] , visit to [LOC Colombia  ] and meetings with President [PER Uribe  ] in [LOC Cali  ] . 
[PER Jimenez  ] mentioned that [LOC Spain  ] had offered to be helpful in easing tensions over the border with [LOC Ecuador  ] , and had offered to provide a radar in order to ensure better border communication between the two countries . 
In her visit to [LOC Quito  ] , [PER Jimenez  ] said [MISC Ecuadorian  ] President seemed most concerned about salvaging his international image damaged by evidence linking him and his government to the [LOC FARC.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Jimenez  ] asserted President [PER Zapatero  ] was keen on strengthening ties with the troubled [MISC Andean  ] region . 
Of the [MISC Andean  ] nations , [LOC Bolivia  ] was the most worrisome for [LOC Spain  ] . 
She did not see [LOC Bolivia  ] breaking up , but did see the potential for violence between the regions as a real possibility . 
While President [PER Evo Morales  ] might be strengthened by any referendum , it seemed to [PER Jimenez  ] that [PER Morales  ] had " thrown in the towel " and was no longer fighting the prefects . 
She noted that [PER Morales  ] appeared to be looking for external enemies such as USAID to detract from his domestic problems . 
Overall , however , [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC Europe  ] had reason to be optimistic as things were " settling " throughout [LOC Latin America  ] . 
[PER Young  ] democracies that had not yet performed well needed time to consolidate their maturing democracies , yet [PER Jimenez  ] judged there was a low risk of back-sliding in most countries of the region . 
[PER Jimenez  ] and the [ORG DCM  ] agreed that the recent mob attack on the [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy was of grave concern and seriously weakened the credibility of the [MISC Bolivian  ] government to guarantee the security of diplomatic missions. //Argentina// <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Regarding [LOC Argentina  ] , [PER Jimenez  ] said President [PER Cristina Kirchner  ] had canceled a planned July 14 visit to [LOC Spain  ] due to the conflict with the farmers . 
[PER Jimenez  ] agreed that [LOC Argentina  ] had once again lost an opportunity to move its economy forward . 
She called [PER Kirchner  ] 's response to the ongoing farm protests a shame for such a great and resource-rich country and said she hoped that there would be a viable and organized opposition . 
She lamented the weakness of [MISC Argentine  ] political parties and noted she was troubled by the " unionized " opposition mounted in the countryside by the farmers , which she said threatened chaos . 
[PER Jimenez  ] opined that part of the problem was [PER Cristina  ] 's over-reliance on former President [PER Nestor Kirchner  ] , whose confrontational approach to politics was exacerbating the crisis. //Cuba// <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Turning to [LOC Cuba  ] , [PER Jimenez  ] expressed hope the [ORG EU  ] 's strategy would be successful and would generate positive change . 
The [ORG DCM  ] voiced the [ORG Administration  ] 's skepticism that these measures would generate positive response from [PER Raul Castro  ] . 
[PER Jimenez  ] expressed the hope that if real change were evident , [LOC Washington  ] might be able to adjust its own approach . 
The [ORG DCM  ] assured her that if [LOC Cuba  ] embarked on a genuine path of political reform , the [LOC U.S.  ] was ready and had a plan to engage and provide support . 
[PER Jimenez  ] echoed opinions heard previously in our past discussions on [LOC Cuba  ] , insisting that the international community could not merely wait for change but must talk to the regime and push directly in order for changes to come . 
The [ORG DCM  ] said the [ORG USG  ] was pleased that a wide spectrum of [ORG EU  ] countries had participated in the June review process and that the declaration was cautious , mentioned prisoners of conscience , and included at a minimum the one-year evaluation mechanism. //Latin [MISC American Working Group//  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Jimenez  ] expressed hope that [LOC Spain  ] would further strengthen its relationship with the [LOC United States  ] so that in a global scenario , the whole [ORG Western Hemisphere  ] will become one pole: ( just ) [LOC America  ] . 
She noted that in all of her meetings with [MISC Latin American  ] leaders , she stressed the importance of having strong relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] as essential to maintaining hemispheric cohesion , which was good for the region and in [LOC Spain  ] , s interest . 
[PER Jimenez  ] said her office would continue to work with [ORG WHA A/S Shannon  ] to bridge the gap in our perspectives through the end of the [ORG Bush Administration  ] . 
She told the [ORG DCM  ] she looked forward to going to [LOC Washington  ] in September in conjunction with her travel to [LOC New York  ] for the [ORG UN General Assembly  ] . 
[PER Jimenez  ] planned to spend the first few days with President [PER Zapatero  ] at the [ORG UN  ] and return for the [ORG LAWG  ] at the end of the week , but saw no need to stay in [LOC New York  ] for bilateral meetings with [LOC Western Hemisphere  ] leaders who frequently come to see her in [LOC Spain  ] . 
Asked by the [ORG DCM  ] if she would still be interested in visiting [ORG Southern Command  ] in [LOC Miami  ] , she demurred vaguely saying that " they " would think it wrong . 
She said it was important nonetheless to maintain contact with the [MISC Cuban  ] community in [LOC Miami  ] and to have a presence -- even if her interlocutors were critical of [MISC Spanish  ] policy . 
[PER Jimenez  ] and the [ORG DCM  ] agreed that both [LOC Spain  ] and the [LOC United States  ] had common political and economic interests in [LOC Latin America  ] and needed to continue to work closely together . 
The [ORG DCM  ] noted that [ORG A/S Shannon  ] 's numerous visits to [LOC Europe  ] demonstrated our interest in working closely with [LOC Europe  ] on [MISC Latin America.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) COMMENT: [PER Jimenez  ] appeared increasingly confident in her role as [LOC Spain  ] , s senior policymaker on [LOC Latin America  ] and will remain our principal interlocutor in the region . 
It will be important to continue to work with her and influence her on issues of mutual interest .
