[LOC CARACAS  ] 1865 Classified By: AMBASSADOR CLIFFORD SOBEL FOR REASONS 1.4 ( B ) AND ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) SUMMARY: Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] , [ORG DCM  ] , and [ORG POLCOUNS  ] met with [MISC Dutch  ] FM [PER Bot  ] on June 30 for a tour d'horizon discussion of outstanding issues . 
[PER Bot  ] praised the excellent ( and improving ) state of [MISC U.S.-Dutch  ] relations , but identified four irritants to be addressed through ongoing consultations: [MISC Dutch  ] dissatisfaction with the [LOC U.S.  ] handling of the [MISC Trafficking  ] in [MISC Persons  ] issue ; the lack of opportunities for [MISC Dutch  ] businesses in [LOC Iraq  ] ; perceived [LOC U.S.  ] indifference to [ORG Non-Proliferation Treaty  ] obligations ; and the treatment of detainees at [LOC Guantanamo  ] and other [LOC U.S.  ] facilities . 
[PER Bot  ] confirmed that the [MISC Dutch  ] are moving forward with plans to send 1,000 to 1.2000 troops to [LOC Southern Afghanistan  ] in conjunction with [MISC British  ] and [MISC Canadian  ] forces under ISAF auspices . 
With regard to [LOC Venezuela  ] , [PER Bot  ] confirmed that the [MISC Dutch  ] have invited [PER Chavez  ] to the [ORG Hague  ] ( no date set ) but intends to deliver a tough message to discourage [MISC Venezuelan  ] meddling in the [LOC Antilles  ] . 
[PER Bot  ] also indicated a willingness to push for a tougher line on [LOC Venezuela  ] within the [ORG EU  ] . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] have formally renewed their commitment to the [ORG NATO Training Mission in Iraq  ] ( [ORG NTM-I  ] ) and can do more provided other allies make comparable contributions . 
[PER Bot  ] would be interested in doing more in the [LOC Middle East  ] in a national capacity , possibly including contributions to the [ORG Multinational Force and Observers  ] ( [ORG MFO  ] ) if asked and also intends to work through the [ORG EU  ] to support projects in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
The current crisis in the [ORG EU  ] will could end the political career of [LOC Luxembourg  ] PM [PER Juncker  ] , according to [PER Bot  ] . 
[PER Bot  ] expects [PER Solana  ] to remain in place in the hope of one day becoming [ORG EU  ] Foreign Minister ( [PER Jaap de  ] [PER Hoop Scheffer  ] , on the other hand , told the Ambassador he thinks Fischer may be a stronger candidate for this position . 
) [PER Bot  ] found his recent meetings with FM [MISC Lavrov  ] more productive than those held during the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG EU  ] presidency . 
On [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Bot  ] believes the new government will take a harder line domestically while trying to maintain good foreign relations ; at the same time , [PER Bot  ] remains concerned that [MISC Dutch  ] parliamentary pressures to fund an exile-run satellite TV station would have damaging repercussions for [MISC Dutch  ] and [ORG EU  ] efforts to moderate [MISC Iranian  ] behaviour . 
END SUMMARY . 
[MISC DUTCH  ] CONCERNS: --------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Foreign Minister [PER Bot  ] noted that [MISC Dutch-U.S.  ] relations remained excellent and , if anything , had become stronger over the last four years . 
This relationship had proven its worth during the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG EU  ] presidency , when both sides had grown even closer while pursuing shared objectives . 
The steady stream of high-level [LOC U.S.  ] visitors to the [LOC Netherlands  ] ( including President [PER Bush  ] ) and vice versa had clearly made a positive impact . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] considered themselves valued partners of the [LOC U.S.  ] , and this partnership had produced tangible results in many spheres . 
[PER Bot  ] stressed that he was personally committed to ensuring the continuation of a strong transatlantic relationship . 
In this context , the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [LOC Netherlands  ] should work to remove irritations in the relationship , including: - [MISC Trafficking  ] in [MISC Persons:  ] The [MISC Dutch  ] feel they are contributing significantly to the international fight against [MISC Trafficking  ] in [MISC Persons  ] and object to being subjected every year to [LOC U.S.  ] criticism in this area . 
[PER Bot  ] said the annual fight to remain in Tier One is a source of a lot of irritation in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
The current [LOC U.S.  ] system , he continued , appears to punish the [LOC Netherlands  ] for being transparent and open and does not sufficiently take into account [MISC Dutch  ] efforts to address transit issues. - [LOC Iraq  ] Reconstruction: [PER Bot  ] said he is repeatedly asked , including in parliament that morning , why [MISC Dutch  ] companies have not received more contracts in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
There is a perception that countries like [LOC France  ] and [LOC Germany  ] are receiving more contracts than the [LOC Netherlands  ] , even though the [MISC Dutch  ] have made significantly greater contributions to [MISC Iraqi  ] stability and reconstruction . 
This is a sore point in the [MISC Dutch  ] business community , as major companies ( such as Phillips ) feel that they are not receiving a fair share of opportunities in [LOC Iraq.  ] - [MISC Non-Proliferation:  ] The failure of the [ORG NPT Review Conference  ] , [PER Bot  ] said , was viewed by many as a sign that the [LOC U.S.  ] is not serious about multilateral non-proliferation efforts . 
If the [LOC U.S.  ] wants support in combating nuclear proliferation , it should also be prepared to assist those countries seeking a peaceful nuclear power capacity as provided for in the treaty. - [PER Guantanamo: Bot  ] recalled that at the [ORG UNHRC  ] meeting in [LOC Geneva  ] , the [MISC Dutch  ] voted in favor of the [MISC U.S.-supported  ] [LOC Cuba  ] resolution and the [LOC U.S.  ] promised to consider allowing [ORG UN Human Rights Rapporteurs  ] to visit [LOC Guantanamo  ] . 
The fact that no such visits have occurred is a source of embarrassment to the [MISC Dutch  ] government . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] parliament is also pressing the government hard to explain its arrangements for handling prisoners taken by [MISC Dutch  ] forces in [LOC Afghanistan  ] to ensure they covered by the [LOC Geneva  ] protocols -- i.e. , that they are not turned over to [MISC American  ] forces . 
These charges are becoming increasingly difficult to counter , he said . 
Recalling his discussion with Deputy Secretary of [PER State Zoellick  ] , [PER Bot  ] reiterated that resolving these concerns would make it easier for the [LOC Netherlands  ] to respond positively to anticipated future requests . 
The Ambassador noted that in responding to parliamentary concerns , the Foreign Minister should be aware that there had been no referrals to [LOC Guantanamo  ] in the past year. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Bot  ] reiterated that he was very satisfied with the tremendous successes of the [MISC Dutch-U.S.  ] relationship over the past several years . 
He felt it was important , however , to restate officially [MISC Dutch  ] concerns in the above areas . 
In response , Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] seconded [PER Bot  ] 's overall positive assessment of [LOC U.S.-Dutch  ] relations . 
The key to overcoming the various irritations cited by [PER Bot  ] was to continue communication and consultations at all levels . 
Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] noted that the TIP , [LOC Iraq  ] Reconstruction , and [LOC Guantanamo  ] issues were already the subject of intense , high-level dialogue in the [ORG Hague  ] and in [LOC Washington  ] , which should continue . 
AFGHANISTAN: ----------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) Picking up on [PER Bot  ] 's [LOC Guantanamo  ] comments , Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] asked [PER Bot  ] whether these concerns would interfere with the [MISC Dutch  ] government 's plans to staff a second Provincial Reconstruction Team ( [ORG PRT  ] ) in [LOC Afghanistan  ] during phase III . 
[PER Bot  ] said that , on the contrary , the government was moving ahead with plans to send 1,000 - 1,200 troops to [LOC Southern Afghanistan  ] in 2006 for an 18-month deployment in conjunction with [MISC British  ] and [MISC Canadian  ] deployments in the same region . 
[PER Bot  ] said the [MISC Dutch  ] contingent would expect to lead the overall deployment in the region , which could include other forces ( from the [LOC Baltics  ] , for example ) and would staff a headquarters for the middle six months of the deployment . 
In response to a question from POLCOUNS , [PER Bot  ] confirmed that these plans had been briefed to key parliamentary leaders ( including the opposition [ORG PvdA  ] ) who concurred with the government 's plans , with two conditions: 1 ) the troops should be deployed in an ISAF , vice [ORG OEF  ] , capacity ; and 2 ) [ORG Dutch Special Forces  ] should be withdrawn from the region prior to the [ORG PRT  ] 's deployment for purposes of deconfliction . 
( Note: The current [MISC Dutch  ] SOF deployment to [ORG OEF  ] was already expected to conclude in April 2006 . 
) VENEZUELA: --------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) [PER Bot  ] confirmed ( ref b ) that he planned to visit [LOC Caracas  ] in the Fall , and that [PER Chavez  ] had been invited to visit The [ORG Hague  ] this summer if he is in [LOC Europe  ] . 
He stressed , however , that he intended to use these opportunities to deliver a strong message to [PER Chavez  ] that [MISC Venezuelan  ] meddling in the [LOC Antilles  ] would not be tolerated . 
Although he had not yet seen the specific recommendations sent back by the [MISC Dutch  ] Ambassador to [LOC Caracas  ] ( ref c ) , [PER Bot  ] said that he would support steps -- including [ORG U.S. Military Ship  ] visits and high-level U.S.- [MISC Antillean  ] exchanges -- intended to send a clear signal to [PER Chavez  ] . 
With regard to the internal [ORG EU  ] debate on [LOC Venezuela  ] , [PER Bot  ] made clear that he did not accept that [LOC Spain  ] would have the natural lead on the issue as the [MISC Dutch  ] , as a [LOC Caribbean  ] power , have national interests at stake . 
( Later , in a private one-on-one with Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] , [PER Bot  ] indicated that he was not averse to playing a leading role within the [ORG EU  ] on this issue , and that would be interested in discussing [LOC Venezuela  ] issues with senior [LOC U.S.  ] officials to coordinate our approaches . 
) IRAQ: ---- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Noting that the [MISC Dutch  ] parliament had just supported extending the [MISC Dutch  ] contribution to the [ORG NATO  ] Training Mission in [LOC Iraq  ] ( [MISC NTM-I  ] ) , Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] asked whether the [MISC Dutch  ] were still considering expanding their contribution to 100 or more . 
[PER Bot  ] responded that the [MISC Dutch  ] offer to do more remained on the table , but only if other allies made comparable contributions ; so far , he said , most had not done a damn thing . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] were training in [LOC Iraq  ] while others , like [LOC France  ] and [LOC Germany  ] , still only made limited contributions outside [LOC Iraq  ] . 
This continues to be a source of frustration , he said , despite [MISC Dutch  ] efforts to shame other countries to do more. . 
GAZA: ---- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Recalling the recent visit of [ORG MFO  ] Chief Larocco to the [LOC Netherlands  ] ( ref a ) , Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] probed [PER Bot  ] on possible [MISC Dutch  ] contributions following an [MISC Israeli  ] withdrawal from [LOC Gaza  ] . 
[PER Bot  ] made clear that the [MISC Dutch  ] would consider a national contribution to the [ORG MFO  ] if asked , but in the meantime would continue to work through the [ORG EU  ] on development and reconstruction projects ( he noted the [LOC Gaza  ] port project as one possible example . 
) [PER Bot  ] added that he , personally , would like to be more involved in the [LOC Middle East  ] but could not do so without an invitation and specific role . 
[PER Bot  ] said he had raised this more than once with [PER Solana  ] . 
[ORG EU  ] POLITICS: ----------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Turning to internal [ORG EU  ] dynamics , [PER Bot  ] said that [PER Solana  ] still wants to be [ORG EU  ] Foreign Minister , even if this meant waiting for a long time to come . 
[PER Bot  ] had harsh words for [LOC Luxembourg  ] PM [PER Juncker  ] , who , he said , had hoped to be President of the [ORG EU  ] but now stood to lose everything on July 10 if the referendum in [LOC Luxembourg  ] goes against the constitutional treaty . 
[PER Bot  ] suggested that recent polls showing a growing majority voting against the treaty in [LOC Luxembourg  ] were swelled by those who just want to see if [PER Juncker  ] will keep his word and resign -- it 's like a cockfight , Asked whether [PER Bot  ] thought [MISC German  ] Foreign Minister [PER Fischer  ] might be a good candidate to replace [PER Solana  ] ( as had been suggested to the Ambassador by [ORG NATO  ] SYG [PER Jaap de  ] [PER Hoop Scheffer  ] ) , [PER Bot  ] said he understood [PER Schroeder  ] intended to leave his current job following the upcoming [MISC German  ] elections , regardless of the outcome . 
RUSSIA: ------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Asked about the June 28 visit to the [LOC Netherlands  ] of [MISC Russian  ] FM [PER Lavrov  ] , [PER Bot  ] said that his encounters with [PER Lavrov  ] had been much more productive and pleasant than their meetings during the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG EU  ] presidency . 
[PER Lavrov  ] was less confrontational than in the past regarding [LOC Moldova  ] and other areas of concern , but warned the [MISC Dutch  ] that the [MISC Ukrainians  ] were still a problem with regard to [LOC Transnistria  ] despite the change of regime in [LOC Kiev  ] . 
[PER Bot  ] added that the main point of the meeting was to lay the groundwork for a [PER Putin  ] visit next November . 
IRAN: ---- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Based on a meeting with visiting [MISC Iranian  ] parliamentarians the previous week , [PER Bot  ] said he believed the new [MISC Iranian  ] government would concentrate first on imposing a harder line domestically while trying to maintain a more reasonable approach in foreign policy . 
[PER Bot  ] noted that the [MISC Dutch  ] parliament 's insistence ( reconfirmed on June 30 ) on having the government fund an exile-supported satellite TV station to broadcast independent media into [LOC Iran  ] put him in an awkward position , as he did not wish to undermine [ORG EU  ] policy regarding [LOC Iran  ] or put [MISC Dutch  ] business interests there in jeopardy . 
That said , he confirmed that the government had no choice but to find a way to implement the binding parliamentary amendment while doing as little damage as possible to [MISC EU-Iranian  ] relations .
