Burns:  ] Reasons 1.4 ( b/d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary . 
[MISC Chinese  ] Premier [PER Wen Jiabao  ] arrived in [LOC Moscow  ] November 5-6 to close the " Year of [LOC China  ] " in [LOC Russia  ] . 
His visit focused on trade and energy . 
While the [MISC Russian  ] [ORG MFA  ] portrayed the visit as a successful expression of flourishing economic relations , the [MISC Chinese  ] [ORG Embassy  ] cautioned that the agreements reached are only the first steps of a potentially fruitful relationship . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] Embassy expressed frustration at the lack of follow-through on the seemingly impressive number of bilateral agreements already in place , blaming [LOC Russia  ] 's inherent suspicion of [MISC Chinese  ] economic power , as well as increasing [MISC Chinese  ] self-sufficiency in areas such as weaponry . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] Embassy speculated that relations would improve as [LOC Russia  ] becomes more economically self-confident . 
No agreements were signed on the [ORG East-Siberian Pacific Ocean  ] ( [ORG ESPO  ] ) pipeline , but [ORG Transneft  ] told us delays were due to construction issues and the [MISC Chinese  ] need to establish purchase agreements with crude suppliers , not political concerns . 
[MISC Russian  ] gas exports to [LOC China  ] are likely to take off after completion of the [ORG ESPO  ] pipeline , and [ORG Gazprom  ] is positioning itself to monopolize the trade , putting pressure on [ORG ExxonMobil-operated Sakhalin  ] 1 , who also hopes to get in the game . 
Four agreements were signed expanding civil-nuclear cooperation , but broke little new ground . 
End Summary . 
2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Chinese  ] Premier [PER Wen Jiabao  ] visited [LOC Moscow  ] November 5-6 , concluding a four-nation tour that included [LOC Uzbekistan  ] , [LOC Turkmenistan  ] , and [LOC Belarus  ] . 
[ORG Wen  ] met with President [PER Putin  ] , PM [PER Zubkov  ] and [PER FM Lavrov  ] . 
[ORG MFA First Asia Director Department  ] [PER Andrei Kupik  ] told us on November 13 that the visit was very successful , noting this was one of a number of recent high level meetings between the [ORG GOR  ] and [LOC China  ] , including five meetings this year between President [PER Putin  ] and [MISC Chinese  ] President [PER Hu Jintao  ] . 
Nine deliverables were signed , including documents on economic and nuclear cooperation . 
Economic Focus of [ORG Wen Visit  ] --------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Kupik  ] gave an upbeat assessment of the economic success of the visit , noting that trade was at $33 billion in 2006 , and the [ORG GOR  ] expected it to reach $60 billion a year by the end of the decade . 
He acknowledged that [LOC Russia  ] needed to increase the level of high-tech exports to [LOC China  ] , and that industrial cooperation was lower than it could be , but remained optimistic about the energy , real estate , and space sectors . 
He hyped the upcoming March businessmen 's council , which the [ORG GOR  ] intends to be a government-supported mechanism to facilitate bilateral investment , especially for small and medium businesses. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) While the range of agreements , joint statements , and [MISC MOUs  ] signed during [ORG Wen  ] 's visit appears impressive , [MISC Chinese  ] Embassy Economic and [ORG Commercial Section First  ] Secretary [PER Li Jianmin  ] and attach [PER Ma Chi  ] cautioned that these are only first steps in realizing the [MISC Sino-Russian  ] economic potential . 
Comparing official occasions such as this visit to a stage , they emphasized that the goal is to provide companies and the private sector -- the real actors -- the place and opportunity to forge mutually beneficial relationships . 
The governments , they implied , will not be the main drivers of the bilateral economic relationship. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Although our [MISC Chinese  ] Embassy contacts described the [ORG Wen  ] visit in positive terms , they expressed frustration with the [MISC Russians  ] on a number of economic issues . 
[PER Li  ] indicated that none of the agreements signed last year , when former Prime Minister [PER Fradkov  ] visited [LOC China  ] had been implemented . 
While bilateral trade between [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC China  ] has grown , amounting to $50 billion for the first nine months of this year as compared to $33.4 billion for 2006 , [MISC Chinese  ] companies continued to experience considerable difficulties doing business in [LOC Russia  ] . 
Part of the problem , according to [PER Li  ] and [PER Ma  ] , is [MISC Russian  ] xenophobia and wariness of [LOC China  ] 's rapid economic growth . 
These attitudes prevent the [MISC Russians  ] from taking full advantage of [LOC China  ] 's comparative advantage in labor-intensive manufacturing . 
[MISC Russian  ] wariness is a natural reaction for a former superpower on the ascent again after a decade of chaos , exacerbated by the long shared border between the two countries and a history of mutual enmity . 
They expressed the belief that once [LOC Russia  ] became more self-confident , it would cease to view [LOC China  ] as a threat . 
Energy is Key ------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Beyond diplomatic visits and agreements , energy is [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00005429 002 OF 003 critical to the [MISC Russia-China  ] economic relationship , playing on both the competitive instincts of each country and their mutual dependence . 
[LOC Russia  ] is a nearby source for [LOC China  ] to fuel its explosive economic growth in the medium- and long-term , and [LOC Russia  ] sees [LOC China  ] as one of the major future consumers of [MISC Russian  ] , especially [LOC East Siberian  ] oil and gas . 
As partners , [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC China  ] are working to complete by 2009 the first phase of the [ORG East-Siberian Pacific Ocean  ] ( [ORG ESPO  ] ) pipeline , which would deliver up to 600,000 barrels/day to [LOC China  ] . 
A second phase of the pipeline would send 1.6 million b/d to [LOC East Asia.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Although the press focused on the lack of an intergovernmental agreement on [ORG ESPO  ] during [ORG Wen  ] 's visit , [ORG Transneft  ] tells us it is unnecessary , and that delays are due to construction and engineering problems and the need for [LOC China  ] to conclude purchase agreements with crude suppliers . 
Currently all oil to [LOC China  ] ( about 200-300 thousand b/d ) is sent via rail , and [ORG Rosneft  ] , the principal supplier via this route after inheriting most of [ORG Yukos  ] , has already announced that due to greater potential profits elsewhere and the inefficiency of rail transport , they will not renew the [MISC Yukos-era  ] contract for supplying [LOC China  ] . 
[LOC China  ] 's oil companies are also finally establishing a foothold in [LOC Russia  ] after years of striking out . 
[ORG CNPC  ] helped finance [ORG Rosneft  ] 's purchase of former [ORG Yukos  ] producing arm , [PER Yugansneftegaz  ] , and has a small joint venture with [ORG Rosneft  ] as well . 
[ORG Sinopec  ] reportedly had a pre-arranged deal to give [ORG Rosneft  ] a 51% stake in Udmurtneft , after [ORG Sinopec  ] bought the company from [MISC Russian-British  ] venture [ORG TNK-BP  ] in 2006 . 
( [PER Note: Perhaps  ] inadvertently confirming widely reported rumors that [LOC China  ] played a role in [ORG Rosneft  ] 's acquisition of [ORG Yukos' Yuganskneftegaz  ] , First Secretary [PER Li  ] complained that state-owned [ORG China National Petroleum Corporation  ] ( [ORG CNPC  ] ) has yet to see the [MISC Russian  ] side keep up its part of the bargain from [ORG CNPC  ] 's $6.1 billion provision of financing to [ORG Rosneft  ] . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Gas shipments to [LOC China  ] are at present non-existent , but should surge once proposed pipelines come online , early in the next decade , and as [LOC China  ] aggressively moves to shift from coal to greater reliance on relatively clean natural gas . 
[ORG ExxonMobil-operated Sakhalin  ] 1 is negotiating with [LOC China  ] to supply 8 billion cubic meters of gas , but is facing pressure from [ORG Gazprom  ] , which insists that it be the sole exporter to [LOC China  ] . 
[ORG Gazprom  ] fears that an independent supplier to [LOC China  ] from [LOC Russia  ] 's [LOC Far East  ] could undermine its own efforts to develop gas and dominate the export of gas from the region. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Meanwhile , the two countries are engaged in a " great game " over energy in [LOC Central Asia  ] . 
[LOC China  ] sees [LOC Turkmenistan  ] and [LOC Kazakhstan  ] as needed alternative and complementary sources to [MISC Russian  ] oil and gas , and has busily been signing agreements to help secure their energy riches . 
Prior to coming to [LOC Moscow  ] , [ORG Wen  ] visited [LOC Ashgabat  ] , where he and [MISC Turkmen  ] President [PER Berdymukhamedov  ] reportedly discussed energy deals , including a proposed gas pipeline and the active participation of [MISC Chinese  ] companies in exploration and production activities in [LOC Turkmenistan  ] . 
The gas pipeline from [LOC Turkmenistan  ] would be routed through [LOC Kazakhstan  ] , which like [LOC Turkmenistan  ] is interested in diversifying its export routes and reducing its reliance on [LOC Russia  ] . 
There is a separate proposed gas pipeline from [LOC Kazakhstan  ] to [LOC China  ] as well as an oil pipeline currently moving [MISC Kazakh  ] crude east . 
These deals complicate the [MISC Russia-China  ] relationship , but are likely as unstoppable as [LOC China  ] 's economic growth . 
[LOC Russia  ] , cognizant of its own current gas-balance problem , needs continued access to [MISC Central Asian  ] gas . 
[LOC Russia  ] would also prefer that the former [MISC Soviet  ] republics remain dependent on [LOC Russia  ] for transit , and to eliminate them to the extent possible as direct competitors in both the [MISC East Asian  ] and world energy markets. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC China  ] pledged to strengthen civil nuclear energy ties by agreeing to build two new nuclear reactors in [LOC China  ] and to enlarge the capacity of a gas centrifuge uranium enrichment facility , which would help [LOC China  ] meet growing demand for nuclear power output . 
[LOC Russia  ] 's Atomstroiexport reportedly made a preliminary deal worth over $5 billion with [LOC China  ] 's [ORG Jiangsu Nuclear Power  ] to build two additional reactors at the [MISC Tianwan  ] nuclear power plant , bringing the total to four . 
No time frame for construction of the reactors has been set . 
[ORG Rosatom  ] Director [PER Sergei Kiriyenko  ] and Chairman of [LOC China  ] 's [MISC Defense  ] , Science , Technology and [ORG Industry Committee Zhang Qingwei  ] signed a protocol on November 6 to amend a 1992 agreement to build an enrichment facility on [MISC Chinese  ] territory . 
[LOC Russia  ] 's nuclear fuel services company [ORG Tekhsnabexport  ] ( [ORG TENEX  ] ) and [MISC Chinese  ] [ORG Atomic Energy Industry Company  ] ( [ORG CAEIC  ] ) finalized an agreement to an expansion of existing cooperation to construct a fourth [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00005429 003 OF 003 set of gas centrifuges at the facility in [LOC Hanzhun  ] . 
Weapons Deals Less Important ---------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [MISC Chinese  ] first secretary [PER Li  ] confirmed that the number of weapons deals between [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC China  ] are on the decline , as the [MISC Chinese  ] military switches its focus from hardware to technology . 
Even on the technology side , [LOC China  ] is relying more and more on its own R&D rather than technology transfers from the [MISC Russians  ] . 
Using fighter jets as an example , [PER Li  ] claimed that [MISC Chinese  ] planes are now at the level of the newest generation of [ORG Sukhoi  ] jets , " if not better . 
" The [MISC Russian  ] MFA is still bullish on arms sales , despite [PER Li  ] 's comments and previous reporting ( reftel ) . 
[LOC Russia  ] maintains that it still produces world-class weapons at discount prices . 
Close of the " Year of [LOC China  ] " ---------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [ORG Wen  ] 's visit celebrated the official end of the " Year of [LOC China  ] " in [LOC Russia  ] . 
More than 200 cultural events -- 50 of them considered major -- took place in [LOC Russia  ] during 2007 . 
[PER Kupik  ] told us that both sides will repeat these reciprocal " culture years , " as they believe they led to an increased level of not only cultural , but also political and economic , cooperation . 
[LOC China  ] is planning another " Year of [LOC Russia  ] " in 2009 , and [LOC Russia  ] will repeat the " Year of [LOC China  ] " in 2010 . 
[PER Kupik  ] told us exhibitions and performances of [MISC Chinese  ] culture would continue through the end of 2007 . 
According to [PER Kupik  ] , when [ORG Wen  ] recognized this would likely be his last meeting with [PER Putin  ] as President , [PER Putin  ] assured him that the strengthening of [MISC Chinese-Russian  ] ties would not change , even after he left office . 
Comment ------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) In contrast to statements by [MISC Chinese  ] Embassy officials , who downplayed the economic significance of these recent discussions , MFA and press reported favorably on the state of [MISC Russia-China  ] economic cooperation . 
A public positive front keeps the door open to constructive discussions on contentious issues such as oil supplies to [LOC China  ] , and serves as a superficial counterweight to the more important [MISC U.S.-China  ] economic relationship . 
By extolling the partnership with [LOC China  ] , [MISC Russians  ] want the [MISC Chinese  ] to see that their neighbor to the north also offers great two-trade trading and market potential .
