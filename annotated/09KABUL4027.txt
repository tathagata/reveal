End Summary. ---------------------- [PER Karzai  ] Focused on [ORG ANSF  ] ---------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In a meeting with Chairman of the [ORG Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mullen  ] , Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] , Defense Minister [PER Wardak  ] , [ORG Presidential Chief of Staff  ] [MISC Daudzai  ] , [ORG National Security Advisor Rassoul  ] , [ORG Deputy National Security Advisor Shaydah  ] , [ORG Presidential Press Spokesperson Houmanzada  ] , and [ORG Afghan National Army  ] Chief of Staff [PER Bismillah Khan  ] on December 14 , President [PER Karzai  ] appeared relaxed although admittedly tired and in need of a vacation . 
[PER Karzai  ] said he planned to take three or four days vacation in [LOC Europe  ] between conferences in [LOC London  ] , [LOC Munich  ] and [LOC Davos  ] . 
He appeared more helpful and committed to [ORG ANSF  ] development than ever , expressing interest in obtaining sufficient recruits to reflect geographic and ethnic balances , and a commitment to establishing a training timeline. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Defense Minister [PER Wardak  ] said [ORG Army  ] recruitment was improving ; last month’s return of 873 formerly AWOL soldiers to their units was a promising sign . 
[ORG Admiral Mullen  ] noted that the 2011 drawdown date was not a political decision , but rather , a [LOC U.S.  ] military recommendation . 
[PER Karzai  ] said that if the [MISC Afghan  ] government was over half way to the 2011 [ORG ANSF  ] recruitment and training goals , it would be a success . 
( Comment: Although [PER Karzai  ] was clearly attempting to manage expectations , he also seemed to be personally vested in this endeavor -- a positive , and relatively new development . 
End Comment . 
) [PER Karzai  ] said he will have his Defense Minister and Chief of Defense , “on the road frequently” to ensure this project moved forward. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Karzai  ] inquired whether [ORG ANSF  ] expansion would include only an increase in training , or also an increase in more sophisticated military equipment for [MISC Afghan  ] internal defense . 
[ORG Admiral Mullen  ] said the [LOC United States  ] would continue to equip the [MISC Afghan  ] forces for counter-insurgency operations , since the territorial defense was not currently a priority , especially considering the [LOC U.S.  ] strategic defense relationship with [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Wardak  ] further noted that more heavy weapons were need for the [ORG ANA  ] over time to increase their capability to defend themselves , and could also be used to fight the [ORG Taliban  ] . 
[ORG Admiral Mullen  ] responded that [MISC Afghanistan’s  ] military requirements will naturally evolve over time , but emphasized that heavy weaponry was not needed at present. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] mentioned how successful the 2003 [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] ( [ORG MOD  ] ) reform was to this institution , noting that the 2006 [ORG MOI  ] reform was neither as comprehensive nor as successful . 
President [PER Karzai  ] agreed , and noted -- characteristically -- that this was due to the failures of [LOC UNAMA  ] , the [LOC United States  ] , and the [ORG E.U.  ] When [PER Eikenberry  ] noted the serious problems in the senior [ORG MOI  ] leadership , [PER Karzai  ] acknowledged this was also an important issue . 
He preferred , however , to work on [ORG MOI  ] reform with the [LOC United States  ] , not the [ORG E.U.  ] or [ORG UNAMA.  ] ---------------------------------- Non-U.S . 
[ORG NATO  ] Troops Can Stay Home ---------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Karzai  ] asked if the other [ORG NATO  ] countries were committed to sending 7,000 non-U.S . 
[ORG NATO  ] troops , and if so , would those numbers be several contributions of 100-200 troops , or larger commitments by a fewer countries . 
He remarked that if the commitments are small contingents from many nations , it would be more of a “headache.” He quipped that if these countries only announced their plan to deploy additional troops , without actually sending them , it would be easier . 
[ORG Admiral Mullen  ] noted the political significance of these troop commitments , despite the challenges they might entail . 
[ORG Admiral Mullen  ] asked [PER Karzai  ] for his assessment of [ORG NATO  ] ISAF efforts to limit civilian casualties . 
[PER Karzai  ] responded that General [PER McChrystal  ] was doing an excellent job [LOC KABUL  ] 00004027 002 OF 003 with his instructions to limit civilian casualties because of the emphasis he placed on restricting the use of aerial bombardments . 
However , he said more needed to be done with the [ORG Special Operations  ] troops , noting recent reports from [ORG Laghman Province of civilian  ] casualties during two separate operations. ---------------------- Skepticism on [LOC Pakistan  ] ---------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Karzai  ] expressed concern over [LOC Pakistan  ] , noting that the [ORG Taliban  ] may decide to lay low there until 2011 . 
[ORG Admiral Mullen  ] replied that if the [ORG Taliban  ] decided to give that security space to the [MISC Afghans  ] , it would be to our advantage , as it would allow time for the [ORG ANSF  ] and security to be built up sufficiently to defend themselves . 
[PER Karzai  ] appeared to accept this answer . 
Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] emphasized that the [LOC United States  ] shared [MISC Afghan  ] concerns over [LOC Pakistan  ] providing sanctuary to the [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Taliban  ] , but noted [MISC Pakistani  ] Foreign Minister [PER Qureshi  ] had stated publicly at the recent [ORG IISS Manama Dialogue  ] in [LOC Bahrain  ] that there was an [MISC Afghan-Pakistani  ] [ORG Taliban  ] nexus -- a possible signal of an evolution in their thinking . 
He also stated , however , that [LOC Pakistan  ] was focused , at present , on its greater threat , the [LOC Pakistan  ] [ORG Taliban  ] . 
Minister [PER Wardak  ] said he had received contrary reports that the [MISC Pakistani  ] [ORG Army  ] was helping the [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Taliban  ] obtain sanctuary in cities “deeper into [MISC Pakistan.”  ] ------------------ Cabinet Selections ------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) President [PER Karzai  ] told [PER Eikenberry  ] after [ORG Admiral Mullen’s  ] departure , with [PER FM Spanta  ] and [ORG NSC Rassoul  ] in attendance , that he still had no date for his cabinet announcement but that he had asked the Parliament to remain in session for the time being . 
He plans on giving Parliament about 75 percent of the cabinet list and expects Parliamentary support for “almost all” of his nominations . 
He said the [ORG National Security Ministers  ] would stay on ( reftel ) , as well as the [LOC Finance  ] , [LOC Commerce  ] , Communications , Agriculture and Health Ministers. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Karzai  ] said the current Higher Education Minister [LOC Dafur  ] would be replaced by the current Governor of [LOC Kabul  ] [PER Zabihollah Mojadedi  ] , or an unnamed senior university official . 
Education Minister [PER Wardak  ] would move to the [ORG Palace’s Office of Administrative Affairs  ] ( [ORG OAA  ] ) , while [ORG MRRD Zia  ] would be given an ambassadorship and his deputy [PER Wais Ahmad Barmak  ] would replace him . 
He said he would appoint a technically qualified individual as the Minister of Mines , and that Nangarhar Governor [PER Gul Agha Sherzai  ] would be given a position involving the construction of roads in urban areas ( Note: it was unclear whether this would be [LOC Urban Planning  ] or a new position . 
End Note . 
) [PER Karzai  ] said the [ORG Ministry of Public Works  ] would go to a qualified engineer with a masters degree from a prestigious [LOC U.S.  ] university , while Transportation would go to [PER Junbesh  ] party’s Batash ( rumored to be a [PER Dostum  ] ally ) . <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Karzai  ] invited the group’s views on placing Commerce Minister [PER Shahrani  ] in the [ORG Ministry of Mines  ] . 
Spanta’s endorsement was lukewarm ; Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] noted Shahrani’s extravagant home , suggesting that the [MISC Afghans  ] knew best who is corrupt , a concern [PER Karzai  ] shared . 
[PER Karzai  ] claimed he would split the [ORG Ministry of Information and Culture  ] into just the [ORG Ministry of Culture  ] and “downgrade” information responsibilities to an agency . 
He said he wanted [PER Spanta  ] to stay on , but [PER Spanta  ] said he was not interested in a cabinet-level position . 
[PER Karzai  ] said [PER Jalali  ] was a possible choice for [ORG NSA  ] , but claimed that he insisted on keeping his $13,000/month [ORG National Defense University  ] salary . 
[PER Eikenberry  ] responded that if this were the case , it hardly seemed like a sign of patriotism . 
[PER Karzai  ] said [PER Atmar  ] was politically “hanging on by a thread” because he was highly disliked for his former communist and excessively pro-Pashtun reputation. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Karzai  ] said [PER Ismail Khan  ] was still his choice for Minister of Energy , claiming that Secretary [PER Clinton  ] “agreed to a compromise” after [PER Karzai  ] promised to keep [PER Atmar  ] and appoint competent deputy ministers under [PER Khan  ] . 
Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] countered that Secretary [PER Clinton  ] did not endorse [PER Khan  ] -- underscoring that the [LOC United States  ] has indicated that Energy and Water is a key [LOC U.S.  ] development priority , and that our policy was not to invest in ministries not competently led . 
[PER Eikenberry  ] added that during his [ORG Congressional  ] testimony , all members of the [ORG U.S. Congress  ] expressed great concern over the long-term costs of [LOC Afghanistan  ] , especially during the current financial crisis . 
[LOC KABUL  ] 00004027 003 OF 003 If incompetent and corrupt ministers were appointed , it would provide a good reason for them to limit funding . 
The Ambassador urged [PER Karzai  ] to consider the tradeoffs , and make a decision on what would most benefit the [MISC Afghan  ] people and their economic future . 
He should worry less about pleasing political factions or foreigners , and more on the objective long-term interests of his citizens . 
[PER Karzai  ] said he would further consider this choice. -------------- 2010 Elections -------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Karzai  ] mentioned that the 2010 [ORG District Council  ] elections could be postponed past 2010 , but the Parliamentary elections should only be delayed three to four months . 
In response to the Ambassador’s concerns about addressing the unsustainable electoral calendar that would eventually bankrupt the [MISC Afghan  ] government , [PER Karzai  ] replied that he would like to hold a [PER Loya Jirga  ] sometime in the fall of 2010 to resolve these constitutional issues . 
He referred to “conspiracy theories” he had heard about the international community’s intentions in delaying the elections that [PER Eikenberry  ] flatly rejected . 
The Ambassador said the [MISC Afghans  ] would have to make the decision whether to delay the elections or not. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
[ORG Admiral Mullen  ] , Chairman of the [ORG Joint Chiefs of Staff  ] did not clear this cable .
