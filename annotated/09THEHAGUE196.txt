Gallagher  ] for reasons 1.5 ( b , d ) Madam Secretary: -------- Overview: -------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) Your participation in the [LOC Afghanistan  ] conference and the March 31 meeting with [MISC Dutch  ] Foreign Minister [PER Maxime Verhagen  ] is well-timed to advance key [LOC U.S.  ] priorities , particularly in securing [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Verhagen  ] and the whole [MISC Dutch  ] government remain among our strongest allies , but [MISC Dutch  ] domestic politics threatens to limit progress on our common agenda . 
On [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Verhagen  ] faces an uphill battle to convince parliament and the [MISC Dutch  ] people to continue combat missions after 2010 . 
At stake is the deployment of 1,700 [MISC Dutch  ] troops in [LOC Uruzgan  ] , one of the toughest provinces in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
By agreeing to host the [LOC Afghanistan  ] conference , [PER Verhagen  ] is taking the first step to extend the [MISC Dutch  ] commitment . 
The Foreign Minister said the [LOC Netherlands  ] had been asked to host the conference due to the success of its comprehensive ( &3-D8 ) approach in [LOC Uruzgan.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Verhagen  ] is a skilled politician , having previously served in parliament as party spokesman for the [LOC Netherlands  ] , largest political party , the center-right [ORG Christian Democrats  ] ( [ORG CDA  ] ) . 
Accordingly , [PER Verhagen  ] is extremely close to Prime Minister [PER Balkenende  ] and is trusted to take the lead on foreign affairs while most of the [MISC Dutch  ] government is focused on the economic crisis . 
The weak governing coalition -- which includes [ORG CDA  ] , the center-left [ORG Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) , and the small [ORG Christian Union  ] ( [ORG CU  ] ) -- is held together less by a common vision than by fear of electoral losses if the government were to collapse ahead of the next scheduled election in 2011 . 
Despite these divisions , [PER Verhagen  ] and [PER Balkenende  ] have successfully steered the [MISC Dutch  ] government toward an active foreign policy that largely aligns with our interests. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Verhagen  ] plans to use his bilateral meeting with you to start building a close working relationship . 
He wants the new Administration to see the [LOC Netherlands  ] as a reliable partner with the [LOC U.S.  ] , sharing many of our goals . 
We recommend you focus discussions on [LOC Afghanistan  ] and human rights ( including [ORG Guantanamo  ] ) ( paragraphs 5-11 ) , but other possible topics are also discussed below ( paragraphs 12-17 ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( SBU ) 2009 marks the 400th anniversary of [PER Henry Hudson  ] , s &discovery8 of the [LOC Hudson Valley  ] and [LOC New Amsterdam  ] in 1609 . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] government and the city and state of [LOC New York  ] have planned a yearlong celebration ( [LOC New York  ] 400 ) NY400 ) honoring our strong bilateral ties and stressing our " " shared [MISC DNA  ] " " -- including our values of freedom , democracy , entrepreneurship , diversity , and tolerance . 
You may wish to comment on our joint history and shared future when you meet [PER Verhagen  ] , especially when you talk to the press. ----------- [LOC Afghanistan  ] ----------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [LOC Netherlands  ] is a small ally making a big impact in [LOC Afghanistan  ] since 2001 . 
They are the fourth largest aid donor in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Ranked by percentage of their military forces deployed , the [LOC Netherlands  ] is the second largest military contributor in [LOC Afghanistan  ] ) - proportionally they are making three to four times the contribution of [LOC France  ] or [LOC Germany  ] . 
And [MISC Dutch  ] soldiers are deployed to the most dangerous parts of [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
However , the [MISC Dutch  ] are considering dramatically scaling back their combat presence in 2010 , perhaps to just a few hundred soldiers , and concentrating more on development assistance. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Although the public supports its soldiers in the [LOC Q6  ] . 
( C ) Although the public supports its soldiers in the field , involvement in [LOC Afghanistan  ] is not popular in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
Thus far the [MISC Dutch  ] have lost 18 soldiers . 
The 2007 decision to extend the [MISC Dutch  ] military deployment was prolonged and politically difficult . 
Any government decision to stay engaged in [LOC Afghanistan  ] past 2010 will be even more difficult to sustain . 
Among the challenges is a [MISC Dutch  ] perception that they have done more than their share . 
Many political leaders supported the previous deployment decisions with statements that another [ORG NATO  ] ally would replace the [MISC Dutch  ] at the conclusion of their tour . 
[MISC Dutch  ] opinion leaders are also concerned about the effect of the deployment on military readiness and recruitment . 
Often cited is the shortfall of 7,000 personnel in a 42,000-member service . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] are also daunted by reports that the ISAF mission is THE HAGUE 00000196 002 OF 004 failing to bring security to the [MISC Afghan  ] people , and that development assistance programs are ineffective . 
The public at large is skeptical that the situation in [LOC Afghanistan  ] presents a threat to [MISC Europeans  ] . 
Finally , although casualties have been relatively light by [LOC U.S.  ] standards , their emotional impact on a small country with limited recent combat experience cannot be overstated . 
In April 2008 , for example , the country was shocked to learn of the death of [ORG First Lieutenant Dennis  ] van [PER Ulm  ] on the same day that his father , General [PER Pieter van Ulm  ] , was sworn in as the new [MISC Dutch  ] Chief of [MISC Defense.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Such traumatic events have not swayed [PER Verhagen  ] and PM [PER Balkenende  ] 's commitment to the [ORG NATO/ISAF  ] mission and the [MISC Afghan  ] people . 
In 2009 , just as in 2007 , we expect that both [PER Verhagen  ] and [PER Balkenende  ] will be strong and effective allies in winning support from the parliament . 
The support of the [ORG Labor Party  ] , particularly [ORG Development Cooperation Minister Koenders  ] , will be essential . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] are expecting a request through [ORG NATO  ] for continuing military support , but it is important the request come in the form of consultations among equals rather than through public pressure , which would backfire with the [MISC Dutch  ] public and politicians . 
The [ORG Afghanistan Conference  ] this month will do a great deal to show that the [MISC Dutch  ] are not only active participants but leading members in the review and strategic planning process . 
Your meeting with [PER Verhagen  ] will further emphasize this point . 
Other &selling points8 for the public will be ( 1 ) recognition that [LOC Afghanistan  ] poses a clearly defined threat to international stability and ( 2 ) an improved military strategy that shows that we can and will prevail . 
Most importantly to the [MISC Dutch  ] public , perhaps , will be concrete success stories that we are creating a better life for the [MISC Afghan  ] people . 
Finally , [MISC Dutch  ] policy-makers believe in the &3D8 approach and welcome your effort to integrate defense , development , and diplomacy . 
A previous [MISC Dutch  ] commander of [ORG Task Force Uruzgan  ] argued that the [MISC Dutch  ] 3D approach can &make the [ORG Taliban  ] irrelevant8 by winning hearts and minds. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The [MISC Dutch  ] will be interested in the [LOC U.S.  ] analysis of [LOC Pakistan  ] , s role in solving the [LOC Afghanistan  ] quandary . 
After suspending aid to [LOC Pakistan  ] in 2008 , the [MISC Dutch  ] expect to provide as much as 112 million euro in development aid to [LOC Pakistan  ] over the next three years , with the timing of a public announcement yet to be determined . 
The government will continue to watch political developments there closely out of concern the government may not live up to its democratic commitments. --------------------------- [ORG Human Rights and Guantanamo  ] --------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) [PER Verhagen  ] has made human rights a priority for the [MISC Dutch  ] government and his hallmark as Foreign Minister . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] are anxious to work closely with us on human rights issues and welcome the return of the [LOC U.S.  ] as an observer to the [ORG Human Rights Council  ] ( [ORG HRC  ] ) in [LOC Geneva  ] . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] are serving a second consecutive term on the [ORG Council  ] , and while they share our frustration with the results , [PER Verhagen  ] will probably encourage you to seek an [ORG HRC  ] seat in 2009 or 2010 . 
In addition , [PER Verhagen  ] may suggest a joint U.S.-Dutch initiative to counter violence against women or to attack child labor . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] are also trying to salvage the [LOC Durban  ] review conference on racism , including by circulating an abbreviated draft that removes references to [LOC Israel  ] that are offensive to us and the [MISC Dutch  ] . 
Perhaps the best opportunity Qoffensive to us and the [MISC Dutch  ] . 
Perhaps the best opportunity for expanding cooperation is in the area of development assistance . 
The [LOC Netherlands  ] is the world , s sixth largest aid donor , providing over 4 billion euro ( $6.1 billion ) annually , and [MISC Dutch  ] programs are rated as highly effective compared to other nations. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) [PER Verhagen  ] has been critical of [ORG Guantanamo  ] , and did not lose an opportunity to raise his concerns about [ORG Guantanamo  ] with the previous administration . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] parliament , s debate and fierce criticism of [ORG Guantanamo  ] have permeated the [MISC Dutch  ] press and public , s perceptions . 
Closing [ORG Guantanamo  ] , therefore , will go a long way toward improving [MISC Dutch  ] skepticism of [LOC U.S.  ] policies on human and civil rights . 
[PER Verhagen  ] publicly saluted the President , s decision to close [ORG Guantanamo  ] , but he also publicly told Parliament that the [MISC Dutch  ] government has no plans to accept detainees . 
Nonetheless , [PER Verhagen  ] , s personal staff recommended that you raise the issue with him privately , to encourage him to stay open to the idea of supporting an [ORG EU  ] proposal to help the [LOC United States  ] . 
A less difficult alternative for the [MISC Dutch  ] than accepting detainees would be providing funding to assist with the transfer of detainees to third countries . 
With an eye to the future , FM [PER Verhagen  ] is funding a two-year study of THE HAGUE 00000196 003 OF 004 the nexus of human rights , humanitarian law , and use of force , thus aiming to resolve the knotty legal issues surrounding [LOC Guantanamo.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( SBU ) Finally , [PER Verhagen  ] may ask you about [LOC U.S.  ] support for the [ORG International Criminal Court  ] ( [ORG ICC  ] ) . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] are proud of serving as the &home of international law8 and hosting many international legal institutions such as the [ORG International Court of Justice  ] . 
If you or the President chose to make a major announcement on the [ORG ICC  ] , or [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to international law and human rights , no setting in [LOC Europe  ] would be more appropriate than The [LOC Hague  ] , the [LOC Netherlands.  ] ------------------------------ Other Issues - [ORG Economic Crisis  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [MISC Dutch  ] financial sector has been hit hard by the global financial crisis , due in part to exposure to [LOC U.S.  ] mortgage-backed securities and other toxic assets . 
The government has responded assertively with several measures to assist banks and their customers , most dramatically by nationalizing the [MISC Dutch  ] operations of [ORG Fortis Bank  ] and by providing capital to [ORG ING  ] and guaranteeing part of its [LOC U.S.  ] mortgage portfolio. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [MISC Dutch  ] real economy is struggling . 
After 2 percent GDP growth in 2008 , the latest official estimate is a 3.5 percent contraction in 2009 . 
[MISC Dutch  ] exports are expected to decline by 12 percent this year , a major blow to this trade-dependent economy . 
The [ORG Port of Rotterdam , Europe  ] 's largest , has already seen a 15 percent decline in port traffic since October . 
Several [MISC Dutch  ] industry giants have announced layoffs . 
The current unemployment rate of 3.9 percent is forecast to climb to 5.5 percent in 2009 ( still considerably lower than the [ORG EU  ] average ) . 
The [ORG GONL  ] has passed two stimulus packages and is expected to announce a third shortly. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) An invitation to the [MISC G-20  ] summit in [LOC London  ] is a major win for the [MISC Dutch  ] , who fought hard to be included in the November 2008 [MISC Washington G-20  ] summit . 
Although not a [MISC G-20  ] member , the [MISC Dutch  ] argued successfully that they play a major role in the international financial system ( for instance , it is an active member of the [ORG Financial Stability Forum  ] ) . 
Now , with a second invitation , the [MISC Dutch  ] hope to have assured their seat at the table for future [MISC G-20  ] events . 
At the [LOC London  ] summit , we can expect the [MISC Dutch  ] to support [LOC Germany  ] and other key member states in a call for much broader financial regulation ) but to refrain from supporting new stimulus packages until the results of current stimulus measures can be determined . 
They will support the [MISC G-20  ] , s expansion to include more developing countries . 
In keeping with their reputation , the [MISC Dutch  ] will also stress open markets and free trade . 
They have called on fellow [ORG EU  ] Member States to avoid protectionist measures , and they were highly critical of the proposed " " Buy [MISC American  ] " " provisions in the [LOC U.S.  ] Recovery and [ORG Reinvestment Act  ] . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] have repeatedly expressed their hope to see the economic crisis spur the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC China  ] , [LOC India  ] , and others to make the concessions necessary to conclude the [LOC WTO Doha Round  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( SBU ) Prime Minister [PER Balkenende  ] and his cabinet enjoyed widespread public support in late 2008 for their quick intervention in the financial sector . 
However , domestic and international criticism of the [ORG GONL  ] 's cautious , incremental approach to the crisis has gathered steam in recent weeks . 
[PER Balkenende  ] , s cabinet continues to consult closely with parliament , labor , and industry on the way forward . 
While Finance Minister [PER Wouter Bos  ] , the politically savvy Deputy QFinance Minister [PER Wouter Bos  ] , the politically savvy Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the [ORG Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) , has taken the lead on the [LOC Netherlands  ] , international response to the economic crisis , Foreign Minister [PER Verhagen  ] has been less visible on this issue. ----------- [LOC Middle East  ] ----------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( SBU ) [PER Verhagen  ] will welcome your readout on the [LOC Middle East  ] ; he is eager to play a constructive role . 
With an eye toward supporting a peace agreement , the [MISC Dutch  ] participate in the [LOC Gaza  ] maritime interdiction initiative to stop arms smuggling and thereby address [LOC Israel  ] , s security concerns . 
Along with the [MISC Danish  ] , the [MISC Dutch  ] have proposed resurrecting the [ORG EU  ] Gaza-Egypt border monitoring mission . 
At the same time , the [MISC Dutch  ] push for greater access for humanitarian aid in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] are substantial donors to [LOC Gaza  ] economic development and governance initiatives , providing 72 million THE HAGUE 00000196 004 OF 004 euro in 2008. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( S ) The [MISC Dutch  ] strongly support the [ORG UN  ] sanctions regime against [LOC Iran  ] and quickly follow up on efforts to curtail proliferation activities . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] reported that sanctions are starting to work -- slowly ) - although they are not targeting the right people . 
Nonetheless , the [MISC Dutch  ] believe there is substantial interest among [MISC Iranian  ] parliamentarians for an exchange with [LOC U.S.  ] counterparts . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] are willing to deepen our U.S.-Netherlands cooperation on information-sharing on [LOC Iran  ] . 
On [LOC Syria  ] , the [MISC Dutch  ] welcome [LOC U.S.  ] outreach to [LOC Syria  ] and agree that the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [ORG EU  ] will get more from the [MISC Syrians  ] if we keep a united front as we push for a peace agreement with [LOC Israel  ] , a secure and stable relationship with [LOC Lebanon  ] , and an end to support for militants .
