End Summary . 
[ORG NEDB  ] WELCOMES [LOC TRADE MISSION  ] , INTERESTED IN INFO TECHNOLOGY 2 . 
( C ) During a January 21 meeting with [PER Mahmoud Jibril  ] , head of [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG National Economic Development Board  ] ( [ORG NEDB  ] ) -- [LOC Libya  ] 's premier think-tank , which reports directly to the Prime Minister 's office -- the Ambassador requested support for the upcoming [LOC Trade Mission  ] , discussed the state of the bilateral relationship , and confirmed the [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to further engagement . 
[PER Jibril  ] pledged to support the [LOC Trade Mission  ] in any way he could , offering to reach out to the Minister of [LOC Economy  ] , Industry and Trade , and to the Minister of [ORG Facilities and Infrastructure  ] to facilitate the program . 
He expressed interest in meeting with companies specializing in the sale of technology , particularly those which could meet the needs of the [ORG NEDB  ] in the areas of distance learning -- linking universities in the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Libya  ] -- and increasing the capacity of the [MISC NEDB-run  ] business incubators in the information technology field . 
[PER Jibril  ] believes the [LOC United States  ] enjoys " a competitive edge " in the field of technology and that " now is the time " for [LOC U.S.  ] business to capitalize on opportunities for trade and investment in [LOC Libya  ] . 
ERASING THE PAST 3 . 
( C ) [PER Jibril  ] commended the Ambassador for assuming the challenging position of leading diplomatic re-engagement after decades of isolation . 
He said that the " inherited political problems " represent a " big hurdle " for the [LOC United States  ] -- both diplomatically and commercially -- and were in need of " creative solutions . 
" The Ambassador acknowledged the difficulties , highlighting that the apparent [ORG GOL  ] freeze on visa issuance for official [MISC American  ] travelers to [LOC Libya  ] is currently setting engagement back . 
[PER Jibril  ] characterized the " visa issues " as something " of the past " and noted " security " is the " overriding concern " influencing [ORG GOL  ] policy on visa issuances for [MISC Americans  ] . 
He recommended that both sides work together to implement joint-projects aimed at " building trust , " that would help to erase the historically negative images that each side has of the other . 
He honed in on the negative perception in [LOC Libya  ] of [LOC U.S.  ] intentions in the region . 
" Changing the [LOC U.S.  ] image among [MISC Arabs  ] and in the region will take consistent work by you and your colleagues who have been in the region and understand it , " he said . 
He noted that the " [MISC Arabs  ] of the sixties are no longer the [MISC Arabs  ] of today , " explaining that the leaders and people of the region no longer reject a relationship with the [LOC United States  ] simply due to the [MISC U.S.-Israel  ] relationship . 
[LOC Libya  ] is one of the countries that wants a relationship with the [LOC United States  ] . 
However , the inclusion of [LOC Libya  ] on the [ORG Transportation Security Administration  ] 's ( [ORG TSA  ] ) list of countries of " special interest " has reinforced negative perceptions about the [LOC U.S.  ] in [LOC Libya  ] . 
The Ambassador confirmed the [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to the bilateral relationship , as evidenced by several points of high level engagement in recent months . 
He advised [PER Jibril  ] not to react hastily to the [ORG TSA  ] list and not to evaluate the entire relationship based on that single measure , but rather to consider the full range of positive steps over the last year . 
[ORG POLITICAL-ACADEMIC DIALOGUE  ] ON ENGAGEMENT 4 . 
( C ) To overcome continuing misperceptions that leave the bilateral relationship vulnerable to misunderstanding , [PER Jibril  ] suggested that both sides convene a forum for 2-3 days , composed of 5-6 scholars and policymakers , with the goal of discussing the relationship and mutual needs and concerns , in order to find solutions to political problems and to design an agenda for pushing engagement forward . 
He noted that he had not yet sought approval for this idea from [ORG GOL  ] decision makers , and commented [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000077 002 OF 002 that he would seek Saif al-Islam 's approval when he was ready to pitch the idea to the [ORG GOL  ] . 
He thought the group could meet either in [LOC Libya  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] , or in a third country , isolated from their regular jobs and environments . 
They would focus on " fixing " areas still " tainted by distortions " on each side . 
The final product would be a strategic program to create the foundation for a " lasting relationship , " as well as the implementation of a " trust building program " to benefit the people of both nations . 
" This business of politics and distorted images is preventing progress , " he concluded . 
5 . 
( C ) The Ambassador explained [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to engage with [LOC Libya  ] through various , issue-specific dialogues , such as the [ORG Human Rights Dialogue  ] , a political-military dialogue , a consular working group , and under the umbrella of the [ORG Trade and Investment Framework Agreement  ] , as well as through a multitude of academic and cultural exchange programs . 
In effect , our response was to tackle the idea piece-by-piece , via a series of dialogues . 
The Ambassador said he would explore [PER Jibril  ] 's dialogue concept on the [MISC U.S.-side  ] , and emphasized that the inclusion of decision-makers in each of our areas of proposed dialogue would be key to the success of such groups . 
( As of January 27 , [PER Jibril  ] had not yet had the opportunity to vet his proposal with [MISC Libyan  ] officials . 
) [ORG U.S.-LIBYA UNIVERSITY  ] LINKAGES 6 . 
( C ) [PER Jibril  ] expressed interest in inviting [LOC U.S.  ] higher academic institutions to visit [LOC Libya  ] and to establish linkages with local universities , possibly even to offer courses in [LOC Libya  ] to local students . 
He described an agreement that the [ORG NEDB  ] recently signed with [ORG Liverpool University  ] in the [LOC United Kingdom  ] to set up a business school in [LOC Libya  ] . 
The [ORG NEDB  ] also has an agreement with [ORG Manchester University  ] to establish a branch in [LOC Libya  ] and to launch an [ORG IBM  ] course for [MISC Libyan  ] students . 
He said that he was ready to finance , provide the infrastructure for , and establish the academic criteria for a [LOC U.S  ] university to offer courses in [LOC Libya  ] . 
[ORG GPC AGENDA ITEM: NATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PLAN  ] 7 . 
( C ) Switching topics , [PER Jibril  ] noted that his agency 's draft " [ORG National Economic Development Plan  ] " would be discussed at the upcoming session of the General People 's [ORG Congress  ] ( [LOC Libya  ] 's parliament-equivalent ) , scheduled for January 26 . 
He described the current state of [MISC Libyan  ] development as in its " second round . 
" The first round had successfully initiated many infrastructure projects throughout the country ; the current round would focus on developing the nation 's human capacity , by improving education and training for the [MISC Libyan  ] people . 
[PER Jibril  ] estimated that whereas about 70 percent of infrastructure and construction projects had already been awarded , [MISC Libyan  ] officials were still determining who would take the lead for the development of human capacity . 
" The [LOC U.S.  ] has the edge here , " he stated . 
" If you don't step in , [LOC Singapore  ] , the [LOC UK  ] , [LOC Germany  ] , and [LOC France  ] are ready . 
" COMMENT 8 . 
( C ) [PER Jibril  ] seemed to be a very open interlocutor -- willing to engage in back-and-forth conversation and brainstorming together comfortably . 
His confidence in his own ability to approach Saif al-Islam with a new idea , as well as to raise the [ORG Trade Mission  ] with [ORG GOL  ] ministers , indicates that he is well-connected within the regime . 
As the head of a think-tank that reports directly to the Prime Minister-equivalent ( who called him during the meeting ) , without the burden of an official policymaking role , he may have a unique ability to influence decision-makers without challenging their authority . 
In response to [PER Jibril  ] 's proposals , the [ORG Public Affairs Section  ] will reach out to [LOC U.S.  ] colleges and universities to explore potential areas for cooperation with [MISC Libyan  ] academic institutions .
