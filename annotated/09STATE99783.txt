( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY: This is an action request . 
Post is requested TO participate in a joint demarche to the Government of [LOC Iceland  ] concerning their recent decisions regarding whaling activities . 
The text of the demarche is contained in paragraph 5 . 
The [LOC United Kingdom  ] has agreed to lead the demarche , and is joined by the governments of [LOC Argentina  ] , [LOC Australia  ] , [LOC Austria  ] , [LOC Chile  ] , the [LOC Czech Republic  ] , [LOC Ecuador  ] , [LOC Finland  ] , [LOC France  ] , [LOC Germany  ] , [LOC Ireland  ] , [LOC Israel  ] , [LOC Luxembourg  ] , [LOC Mexico  ] , [LOC Monaco  ] , The [LOC Netherlands  ] , [LOC New Zealand  ] , [LOC Panama  ] , [LOC Peru  ] , [LOC Portugal  ] , [LOC Spain  ] , [LOC Sweden  ] , the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Uruguay  ] . 
The demarche is meant to encourage the [ORG GOI  ] to review its policies towards whaling and whale conservation , and take into account the significant economic and social benefits that come from the whale watching industry , as well as welcome the [ORG GOI  ] 's participation in discussions on the Future of the [ORG International Whaling Commission  ] ( [ORG IWC  ] ) . 
BACKGROUND: <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG GOI  ] government issued a whaling quota of 150 fin and 200 minke whales for the 2009/2010 whaling season this spring . 
This quota is based on the scientific advice provided by the [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG Marine Research Institute  ] . 
As of September 15 , 2009 , [LOC Iceland  ] has taken 117 fin whales and 70 minke whales . 
All expectations are that by the end of the whaling season , the fin whale quota will be met . 
This represents a very signficicant increase in whaling activity by [LOC Iceland  ] . 
Since resuming commercial whaling activities in 2006 , [LOC Iceland  ] had harvested 45 minke whales and 7 fin whales total prior to this season . 
It is important to note that fin whale is not largely consumed in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
Therefore it is speculated that this large fin whale harvest will be exported to [LOC Japan  ] ( note: there are several non-governmental organizations who believe that the [MISC Japanese  ] market is currently saturated by [LOC Japan  ] 's own whaling activities ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) It is widely thought within the [ORG IWC  ] community that , as a condition to joining the [ORG European Union  ] , [LOC Iceland  ] will need to end commercial whaling activities . 
Many speculate that the dramatic increase in whaling operations this season is one last effort to whale before this decision is made . 
Alternative views are that the whaling industry is demonstrating its capability to discourage [ORG EU  ] membership . 
The [ORG GOI  ] has commissioned a study to review all economic benefits that surround whale conservation and the whaling industry , including whale watching. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [LOC United States  ] is a leader within the [ORG International Whaling Commission  ] , and is committed to resolving the discord that has paralyzed the organization for decades . 
We remain committed to the Future of the [ORG IWC  ] process , and are looking forward to the [ORG Support Group  ] to be held in [LOC Santiago  ] , October 5-16 , 2009 . 
We are approaching this [ORG Support Group  ] meeting with flexibility in mind , and encouraging all participants of the [ORG Support Group  ] , including [LOC Iceland  ] , to do the same . 
DEMARCHE TEXT: <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) the Governments of [LOC Argentina  ] , [LOC Australia  ] , [LOC Austria  ] , [LOC Chile  ] , the [LOC Czech Republic  ] , [LOC Ecuador  ] , [LOC Finland  ] , [LOC France  ] , [LOC Germany  ] , [LOC Ireland  ] , [LOC Israel  ] , [LOC Luxembourg  ] , [LOC Mexico  ] , [LOC Monaco  ] , The [LOC Netherlands  ] , [LOC New Zealand  ] , [LOC Panama  ] , [LOC Peru  ] , [LOC Portugal  ] , [LOC Spain  ] , [LOC Sweden  ] , the [LOC United Kingdom  ] , the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Uruguay  ] , wish to express our support for the Government of [LOC Iceland  ] 's decision to review and reassess its position on the hunting of whales . 
We are deeply disappointed with the former [MISC Icelandic  ] Government 's decision to authorize the hunting of fin and minke whales over the next five years on 27 January 2009 . 
The authorization was put in place without presentation to the [ORG International Whaling Commission  ] ( [ORG IWC  ] ) and without regard for the long-term interests of cetacean conservation . 
We further note that the [MISC Icelandic  ] marine [ORG Research Institute  ] recommended in June an increased quota of up to 200 fin and 200 minke whales for the 2009/2010 season and that almost 200 whales have been killed so far . 
We encourage the Government of [LOC Iceland  ] to adhere to the internationally agreed moratorium on commercial whaling and to re-examine the decision to increase its fin and minke whale quota . 
Both species are listed under the Convention on [ORG International Trade  ] in [ORG Endangered Species of Wild Fauna  ] and [PER Flora  ] ( CITES ) Appendix I and we remain extremely concerned with [LOC Iceland  ] 's reservation , entered in 2000 , for these and other cetacean species . 
We urge [LOC Iceland  ] to withdraw this reservation and safeguard these species from international trade . 
We recognize the conservation efforts made by [LOC Iceland  ] in other international agreements and hope the [MISC Icelandic  ] Government will be able to extend this stance to fully support global efforts for cetacean conservation . 
Furthermore , we would like to draw attention to the considerable economic , social and educational benefits of [LOC Iceland  ] 's growing whale watching industry and share our strong endorsement of the [MISC Icelandic  ] Governments plans to designate specific ocean areas for whale watching . 
We hope this action will reinforce [LOC Iceland  ] 's commitment , as a member of the [ORG Support Group  ] , to the future of the [ORG IWC  ] discussions on the management and conservation of all whale species . 
In summary , we support the [MISC Icelandic  ] Government 's decision to reassess its position on commercial whaling and once again call upon [LOC Iceland  ] to respect the [ORG IWC  ] 's global moratorium and end its commercial whaling. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Department greatly appreciate 's post assistance IN this matter . 
OES/OPA point of contact on this matter is [PER Elizabeth Phelps  ] , reachable on unclass email at phelpse@state.gov , class email at phelpse@state.sgov.gov , or phone at 202-647-0241 .
