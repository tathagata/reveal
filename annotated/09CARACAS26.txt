( C ) Summary: In late 2008 , [PER Chavez  ] once again made statements regarding his plans to develop a nuclear power program in [LOC Venezuela  ] and went so far as to sign an agreement with [LOC Russia  ] 's [ORG Rosatom  ] on nuclear energy cooperation . 
Several local nuclear physicists are skeptical arguing that nothing came of the [MISC Venezuelan  ] government 's interest in nuclear power in the 70 's and nothing will come of it today . 
The scientists argued the government has demonstrated little interest in domestic nuclear research and the result has been antiquated labs with only a handful of [MISC Venezuelan  ] experts in the field . 
Nevertheless , they did not discount the [ORG Chavez Government  ] 's willingness to purchase a nuclear power plant lock , stock and barrel from [LOC Russia  ] if it could get the financing , although they believe this unlikely given [LOC Venezuela  ] 's looming economic crisis . 
End Summary. --------------------------------------------- -- [MISC RUSSIAN  ] CONSTRUCTION OF NUCLEAR PLANTS UNLIKELY --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In November 2008 , [PER Chavez  ] trumpeted that he had high hopes for a nuclear reactor constructed with [MISC Russian  ] technology in the [MISC Venezuelan  ] state of [LOC Zulia  ] to be called the " [PER Huberto Fernandez Moran Nuclear Complex  ] " . 
On December 2 , Econoffs met with three scientists from [LOC Venezuela  ] 's only fully functional nuclear physics research lab at [ORG public University Simon Bolivar  ] ( [ORG USB  ] ) . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ( strictly protect throughout , ) noted [PER Chavez'  ] recent statements on nuclear power were reminiscent of those he made in 2005 . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] speculated that if [LOC Russia  ] would offer [LOC Venezuela  ] enough credit for plant construction , [LOC Venezuela  ] would be happy to accept . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , who after the meeting identified himself as a [MISC Russian-educated  ] scientist of [MISC Cuban  ] origin , added that the [MISC Russians  ] are fully capable of building adequate plants but they would take five to eight years to complete and would cost billions of dollars . 
( Note: Although the Director General of [ORG Rosatom State Nuclear Energy Corporation  ] signed an agreement to cooperate with [LOC Venezuela  ] on nuclear energy on November 26 , international press reports on December 8 indicated no [MISC Russian  ] loans or credits will be forthcoming for costly nuclear power projects in part due to [LOC Venezuela  ] 's uncertain financial future .

) --------------------------------------------- -------- [MISC VENEZUELAN  ] GOVERNMENT NOT SERIOUS ABOUT NUCLEAR POWER --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The second in command at the lab , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ( strictly protect throughout , ) said he has " heard this talk before in the 70 's " when the government was much more serious about developing a nuclear power program and even went so far as to identify several potential sites for hypothetical reactors . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was adamant that " nothing came of it then , and nothing will come of it now . 
" There is only sporadic interest in nuclear power in [LOC Venezuela  ] , which , he noted , is rational given that [LOC Venezuela  ] is a petroleum rich state. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] added that behind every nuclear power project is a team of strong scientists . 
Unfortunately , he said , [MISC Venezuelan  ] politicians are not talking to the scientists . 
He agreed that the current discussion of developing a domestic nuclear energy program in [LOC Venezuela  ] is only talk , as there are no serious scientists involved and no project is underway . 
Even if the government of the [ORG Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela  ] ( [ORG GBRV  ] ) were serious , he said , it would take 10 to 15 years to make substantial progress towards developing a nuclear energy program using domestic resources. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] asserted that his lab at [ORG USB  ] has the most domestic expertise and would be the most likely talent pool if the [ORG GBRV  ] was in the market for government advisors or program heads . 
He added that the [ORG GBRV  ] had recently approached him about serving as a government advisor on nuclear power , but he had declined citing his workload . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he hopes the government will tap the [ORG USB  ] lab at [LOC CARACAS  ] 00000026 002 OF 003 some point to spearhead nuclear power research , with the accompanying funding , as he agrees with President [PER Chavez  ] on [LOC Venezuela  ] 's need to diversify its energy sources . 
He noted that his scientists are currently collaborating with the [ORG National Experimental Politech University  ] of the [ORG Bolivarian Armed Forces  ] , [ORG UNEFA  ] , on developing a course , as the military seems to have a new interest in giving its cadets a nuclear physics background . 
( Note: [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] is hopeful this collaboration might translate into more funding for his lab , which currently looks more like a museum than a functioning research center .

) --------------------------------------------- - BARRIERS TO DEVELOPING A NUCLEAR POWER PROGRAM --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The scientists argued that the [ORG GBRV  ] 's failure to support serious nuclear research has resulted in antiquated labs , restrictive policies that inhibit academic research , and a dearth of experts in the field . 
They also noted lack of uranium as another limiting factor . 
In May 2005 when [PER Chavez  ] announced his plans to start a nuclear energy program , media reports at that time indicated that according to government research in the 70 's , there might be three substantial uranium deposits in [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , however , was firm in his assertion that [LOC Venezuela  ] has little uranium . 
His friend , respected [MISC Venezuelan  ] geologist , often jokes with him that " yes there is a uranium mine , but no one knows where it is . 
" [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] added that [LOC Venezuela  ] has thorium which can be mixed with other radioactive materials and might someday replace uranium in nuclear reactions. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) In addition to a lack of natural resources , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said there is also a severe deficiency in " manpower " . 
He claimed that all of the scientists in [LOC Venezuela  ] capable of running or even assisting with a nuclear power program were in the room . 
( Three scientists were present ) . 
He said he knew perhaps 130 former students that had the academic credentials , but almost all of them were " either selling shoes or building shopping malls . 
" He said the [ORG USB  ] lab is now focusing more on health diagnostics as there is a commercial interest in such research. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also implied he was not impressed with the quality of the government 's staff in the sector . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] is his former student . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
While the [ORG Directorate  ] has its own lab , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he has personally verified that none of its equipment works . 
He noted that the [ORG Directorate  ] is a purely bureaucratic operation where scientists do not conduct research but rather attend numerous conferences abroad . 
When work needs done , the [ORG Directorate  ] will occasionally bring in experts and contract out research projects . 
As an additional example of the government 's failures in the sector , he cited [LOC Venezuela  ] 's sole , and now defunct , reactor at the [ORG GBRV  ] 's [MISC Venezuelan  ] Institute for [ORG Scientific Research  ] ( [ORG IVIC  ] ) . 
[ORG USB  ] , he said , carried off pieces of the 1950 's era reactor several years ago for student experiments. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] finished his list of serious challenges facing the development of a [MISC Venezuelan  ] nuclear power program by complaining about his inability to get permission from the [ORG USG  ] to obtain equipment or even data from the [LOC US  ] . 
He said the [MISC Venezuelan  ] government is even more difficult to work with as it will not give him licenses to import any radioactive material . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] has consequently taken to bringing in undeclared material in his pocket . 
He stated he flew in with a " source " from [LOC California  ] in this manner even though the [ORG University  ] warned him he could end up in jail . 
He ignored the warning saying the [MISC Venezuelan  ] government does not seem to be particularly interested in the fact that all of the radioactive material in the [ORG USB  ] lab is currently illegal under [MISC Venezuelan  ] law . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] added that anything students or professors do with the radioactive material is also illegal . 
After 20 years of his best efforts , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] has yet to get [ORG GBRV  ] approval for radioactive material handling regulations he wrote himself based on manuals he obtained from the [ORG Imperial College of London  ] and a [LOC US  ] university . 
In another " illegal " practice , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that his scientists regularly go scavenging for radium from old [MISC Venezuelan  ] hospitals that they store on the [ORG USB  ] campus . 
[LOC CARACAS  ] 00000026 003 OF 003 ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) In spite of [LOC Chavez'  ] grand public statements , the academic community believes the [ORG GBRV  ] continues to demonstrate that it is uninterested in , or unable to develop a domestic nuclear energy program . 
It has instead hamstrung the efforts of the handful of its scientists with an interest in the area . 
Scientists seem inclined to agree with a member of [LOC Argentina  ] 's [ORG National Atomic Energy Commission  ] who in 2005 was quoted as saying " on a scale of zero to five , nuclear power development within [LOC Venezuela  ] does not reach one . 
It is not only behind [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Argentina  ] , it is also behind [LOC Chile  ] , [LOC Mexico  ] and [LOC Peru  ] . 
" Nevertheless , the [ORG USB  ] scientists seemed confident that if [LOC Venezuela  ] one day finds a country willing to sell its technology on credit , however unlikely given [LOC Venezuela  ] 's looming financial trouble , the [ORG GBRV  ] would be more than willing to buy . 
Regardless of whether or not nuclear power plants make sense in a petroleum rich country , high profile projects that give the rest of the world cause for concern hold a certain appeal for [PER Chavez  ] .
