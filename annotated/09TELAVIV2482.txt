( C ) SUMMARY: On November 1 and 2 , Assistant Secretary of Defense ( [ORG ASD  ] ) for [ORG International Security Affairs  ] , Ambassador [PER Alexander Vershbow  ] , met with a number of senior [MISC Israeli  ] defense officials in [LOC Israel  ] including: [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] ( [ORG MOD  ] ) Director General ( [ORG DG  ] ) [PER Pinchas Buchris  ] ; Head of [ORG MOD Political Military Bureau  ] [PER Amos Gilad  ] ; Assistant Chief of [ORG Defense Major General  ] ( [ORG MG  ] ) [PER Benny Gantz  ] ; and Head of [ORG MOD Intelligence Analysis Production Brigadier General  ] [PER Yossi Baidatz  ] . 
The [MISC Israelis  ] expressed positive views on continued [MISC U.S.-Israel  ] cooperation particularly on [LOC Israel  ] 's [ORG Qualitative Military Edge  ] ( [ORG QME  ] ) and the ongoing [MISC Juniper Cobra  ] missile defense exercise . 
[MISC Israeli  ] officials explained that they were going through an unprecedented period of calm due to the deterrent effect of Operation CAST LEAD , but that below the surface were a number of significant dangers . 
They continued to emphasize that [LOC Iran  ] represents the greatest strategic threat to the region , both its nuclear program and its " axis " with [LOC Syria  ] , [ORG Hezbollah  ] , and [ORG HAMAS  ] . 
They also expressed skepticism about [MISC Palestinian  ] President [PER Abbas  ] 's future , given his weakened position as a result of his handling of the [ORG Goldstone Report  ] and his inability to get the full settlement freeze he had pushed for ; they questioned his ability to restart peace negotiations . 
[MISC Israeli  ] officials were concerned about the deteriorating [MISC Turkey-Israel  ] relationship and discussed threats emanating from both [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
END SUMMARY ------------------- Bilateral Relations ------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG ASD  ] [PER Vershbow  ] 's trip to [LOC Israel  ] came as a number of high-level [MISC Israeli  ] and [MISC American  ] officials were meeting on key issues . 
On October 31 , Secretary of State [PER Clinton  ] arrived in [LOC Jerusalem  ] for talks on the peace process with Prime Minister [PER Netanyahu  ] , Defense Minister [LOC Barak  ] , and Foreign [PER Minster Lieberman  ] . 
In addition , EUCOM Commander Admiral [ORG Stavridis  ] arrived in [LOC Israel  ] on November 1 to observe the [MISC Juniper Cobra-10  ] ballistic missile defense exercise . 
The [ORG ASD  ] 's visit also came in the wake of recent high-level discussions on [LOC Israel  ] 's [ORG QME  ] in [LOC Washington  ] , and the October 21 meeting of the [ORG Joint Politico-Military Group  ] in [LOC Tel Aviv.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) On [ORG QME  ] , [ORG ASD  ] Vershbow asked for [LOC Israel  ] 's assessment of recent discussions , and across the board , [MISC Israeli  ] officials expressed gratitude for [LOC U.S.  ] efforts on this front and voiced optimism on the steps moving forward . 
[PER Amos Gilad  ] acknowledged the sometimes difficult position the [LOC U.S.  ] finds itself in given its global interests , and conceded that [LOC Israel  ] 's security focus is so narrow that its [ORG QME  ] concerns often clash with broader [MISC American  ] security interests in the region . 
[MISC Israeli  ] officials acknowledged the impressive nature of the [ORG QME  ] dialogue mechanisms recently established , but stated that the results of the process are what truly matter . 
MG [PER Benny Gantz  ] defined successful [ORG QME  ] relations as " the effective process plus the right mitigations . 
" While not explicitly saying it , [PER Gantz  ] seemed to acknowledge that [LOC Israel  ] does not expect that all [ORG QME  ] decisions will break in its favor , but that [LOC Israel  ] only expects a fair and equitable process that incorporates " intimate dialogue . 
" [ORG DG  ] Buchris thanked Versbhow for the recent success of the [ORG JPMG  ] and said he looks forward to convening the first meeting of the agreed upon working groups by the end of November . 
[PER Vershbow  ] stated that the technical working group discussions would be launched soon , and that he was looking forward to future [MISC Israeli  ] participation on this issue. ------------------------ [LOC Iran  ] Remains Top of Mind ------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [MISC Israeli  ] officials continue to uniformly emphasize that [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program and regional hegemonic ambitions are the greatest strategic threats to [LOC Israel  ] . 
They view [LOC Iran  ] as the center of a radical axis that includes [LOC Syria  ] , [ORG Hezbollah  ] and [ORG HAMAS.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC S//NF  ] ) [LOC Israel  ] continues to offer a worst-case assessment of the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear program , emphasizing that the window for stopping the program ( by military means if necessary ) is rapidly closing . 
General [PER Baidatz  ] argued that it would take [LOC Iran  ] one year to obtain a nuclear weapon and two and a half years to build an arsenal of three weapons . 
By 2012 [LOC Iran  ] would be able to build one weapon within weeks and an arsenal within six months . 
( COMMENT: It is unclear if the [MISC Israelis  ] firmly believe this or are using worst-case estimates to raise greater urgency from the [LOC United States  ] ) . 
[PER Amos Gilad  ] explained his view of the repercussions of an [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear capability stating that it would give [LOC Iran  ] a free hand in supporting " [MISC HAMAStan  ] " in [LOC Gaza  ] and " [MISC Hezbollahstan  ] " in [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
[PER Gilad  ] also argued that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] would definitely react to a nuclear [LOC Iran  ] by obtaining a weapon ( with [MISC Pakistani  ] assistance ) and [LOC Egypt  ] would almost certainly follow . 
He was less sure about whether [LOC Turkey  ] would respond by pursuing a nuclear weapon . 
Regardless , the security situation in the region surrounding [LOC Israel  ] would be dramatically altered should [LOC Iran  ] acquire a nuclear weapons capability. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC S//NF  ] ) [ORG ASD  ] Vershbow queried various [MISC Israeli  ] officials about their view of the [ORG Tehran Research Reactor  ] ( [ORG TRR  ] ) proposal and [LOC Iran  ] 's recent equivocation on the agreement . 
[MISC Israeli  ] officials uniformly expressed support for the agreement but made clear that by itself it was not sufficient . 
They stated that it was only one stop on the way to containing the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear program and that it must be followed by a freeze-for-freeze agreement and eventually the full suspension of uranium enrichment , as well as the end of work on the newly disclosed site at [LOC Qom  ] . 
They warned that the [ORG TRR  ] agreement by itself could serve as a major victory for [LOC Iran  ] if it legitimized in the world 's eyes [LOC Iran  ] 's right to enrich uranium on its own soil . 
None of the [MISC Israeli  ] officials expressed surprise about [LOC Iran  ] 's apparent reversal on the [ORG TRR  ] agreement , as they viewed this as typical [MISC Iranian  ] negotiating style and part of an [MISC Iranian  ] strategy of delay . 
[PER Amos Gilad  ] stated that [LOC Iran  ] would never agree to anything that contradicted its overall strategic goal of achieving a nuclear weapons capability. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) When queried about how the [LOC U.S.  ] views the [MISC Iranian  ] response , [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] explained that the [LOC United States  ] was still seeking greater clarity on what was the real [MISC Iranian  ] bottom line . 
We may need time to ascertain whether [LOC Iran  ] 's response was in fact a serious walk-back or whether it would be willing to abide by the initial [ORG TRR  ] agreement that had been agreed to in principle in [LOC Geneva  ] on October 1 . 
However , he also emphasized that [MISC American  ] patience is not unlimited and that if the [ORG TRR  ] agreement did collapse , the [LOC U.S.  ] would likely begin pursuing the pressure track. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [LOC S//NF  ] ) [LOC Israel  ] was also highly concerned about [LOC Iran  ] 's support for proxies , with General [PER Baidatz  ] emphasizing that there are multiple bases in [LOC Iran  ] where [LOC IRGC  ] , [ORG Quds Force  ] , [ORG Hezbollah  ] , [ORG HAMAS  ] , and [ORG Palestinian Islamic Jihad  ] operatives all train together and share knowledge . 
MG [PER Gantz  ] also emphasized [LOC Iran  ] 's role as a weapons supplier to [LOC Syria  ] and that [LOC Syria  ] actively facilitated arms transfers to [ORG Hezbollah  ] . 
He expressed concern about [MISC Iranian  ] shipments of weapons via [LOC Sudan  ] to [LOC Egypt  ] and into [LOC Gaza  ] . 
On the [MISC Russian  ] delay in delivery of the [MISC S-300  ] ( SA-20 ) to [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Gilad  ] voiced satisfaction with the train of events , acknowledging Prime Minister [PER Netanyahu  ] 's " secret " visit to [LOC Moscow  ] and President [PER Obama  ] 's engagement with [PER Medvedev  ] had both played a role . 
[PER Gilad  ] was worried about [MISC Russian  ] readiness to support tough sanctions on [LOC Iran  ] . 
[ORG ASD Vershbow  ] said the [MISC Russians'  ] signals on sanctions were mixed , but they seemed genuinely concerned about recent [MISC Iranian  ] missile tests and the revelation of the [LOC Qom  ] facility. ------------------- [LOC West Bank  ] and [LOC Gaza  ] ------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Of particular interest throughout the meetings was the subject of the [MISC Palestinian  ] political situation . 
It was widely agreed that President [PER Abbas  ] is currently in a weakened political state , and [MISC Israeli  ] officials generally cast a dour assessment of [PER Abbas  ] 's future . 
In one exchange , [PER Amos Gilad  ] stated his opinion that [PER Abbas  ] will not survive politically past the year 2011 . 
[PER Gilad  ] further stated that [PER Abbas  ] is facing unprecedented criticism within the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] over his handling of the [LOC Goldstone  ] report , and that this , coupled with a stubborn [ORG HAMAS  ] , has weakened [PER Abbas  ] considerably . 
The [MISC Israelis  ] said the perception in the [MISC Arab  ] world was that the [LOC U.S.  ] had encouraged [PER Abbas  ] to take difficult positions on [LOC Goldstone  ] and settlements only to walk away from him . 
[ORG ASD Vershbow  ] queried [PER Gilad  ] over measures that could be taken to bolster [PER Abbas  ] . 
[PER Gilad  ] responded by stating that [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] peace discussions need to be resumed immediately , but without preconditions , and that both parties need to seek further cooperation on a range of issues -- specifically on the security sector front . 
[PER Gilad  ] expressed optimism over the current atmosphere in the [LOC West Bank  ] , citing improvements in the security and economic spheres , and further stated that the reduced [MISC Israeli  ] [ORG Defense Force  ] ( [ORG IDF  ] ) footprint in the [LOC West Bank  ] has made conditions ripe for advancing the relationship . 
[PER Gilad  ] closed , however , on a sourer note by stating that the [ORG Government of Israel  ] has little faith in the [MISC Palestinian  ] negotiating team. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] transitioned off the political discussion to focus on the [ORG Palestinian Authority Security Force  ] ( [ORG PASF  ] ) . 
Specifically , [LOC Vershbow  ] highlighted the concern that [MISC Palestinian  ] forces were seen as lacking real authority , and therefore asked for steps that could be taken to give the [ORG PASF  ] more visible control of security . 
[MISC Israeli  ] officials responded by citing the decreased number of direct- action incursions , checkpoints and patrols , and seemingly drew a correlation between reduced [ORG IDF  ] activity and increased [ORG PASF  ] authority ( COMMENT: Despite [MISC Israeli  ] assurances , [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Palestinian  ] officials continue to highlight the corrosive effect of regular [MISC Israeli  ] incursions ) . 
MG [PER Gantz  ] cited [MISC Palestinian  ] security sector reform as a major accomplishment , stating that on-the-ground coordination between the [ORG PASF  ] and [ORG IDF  ] units has improved dramatically . 
Despite these positive developments though , [MISC Israeli  ] officials repeatedly underscored the importance of retaining the right to disrupt terrorist operations in the [LOC West Bank  ] and [LOC Gaza  ] . 
Additionally , they stated that if [LOC Israel  ] allowed a weak and untrained security force to take over in the [LOC West Bank  ] in the short term , the result will be deterioration of the [MISC Israel-Jordan  ] relationship over the long term . 
The prospect of poor [MISC Israeli-Jordanian  ] relations , according to [PER Amos Gilad  ] , is unacceptable , and would result in the loss of " strategic depth " for [LOC Israel.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] urged his [MISC Israeli  ] counterparts not to soley focus on the short-term " here and now , " but rathr to envision the possible benefits that a strongand viable [LOC West Bank  ] could have for [LOC Israel  ] 's secrity situation in the future . 
[ORG Vershbow  ] used thi point to springboard to the issue of [ORG HAMAS  ] and aza , asking whether success in the [LOC West Bank  ] coud serve as a " magnet " and help solve the [LOC Gaza  ] problem . 
He asked if [LOC Israel  ] had made any headway in tems of an information operations campaign to better communicate with the people of [LOC Gaza  ] . 
[MISC Israeli  ] officials offered very little in the way of a communications strategy or long-term vision for the territories , but reinforced [LOC Israel  ] 's core belief that [ORG HAMAS  ] has only sinister motives , and that any attempt Fatah might make to improve its standing in [LOC Gaza  ] would only be met with [ORG HAMAS  ] opposition . 
General [PER Baidatz  ] articulated [LOC Israel  ] 's concern by highlighting recent intelligence that [ORG HAMAS  ] is trying to acquire from [LOC Iran  ] ( and potentially test-fired the previous weekend ) the 60 km-range [MISC Fajr-5  ] rocket that could reach [LOC Tel Aviv  ] . 
These actions , according to [PER Baidatz  ] and other officials , make any discussion of [MISC Palestinian  ] reconciliation both premature and unrealistic . 
Ambassador Vershbow sought further clarification on this point , querying [MISC Israeli  ] officials over the level of public support for [ORG HAMAS  ] . 
Specifically , the [ORG ASD  ] asked if there was any way to undermine support for [ORG HAMAS  ] vis-a-vis the peace process . 
[PER Amos Gilad  ] responded simply by saying that one of [LOC Israel  ] 's biggest concerns is the atmosphere created by disjointed peace talks . 
Specifically , [PER Gilad  ] stated that political promises of peace , unification , and reconciliation -- concepts that are never realized -- are only resulting in a climate of uncertainty that is unhealthy . 
On this matter , [PER Gilad  ] mentioned that [LOC Egypt  ] 's role in pushing reconciliation is not helpful and often counterproductive , but that he expects [LOC Egypt  ] to continue floating the idea at future junctures. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) In bringing up the [LOC Goldstone Report  ] , [PER DG Buchris  ] emphasized that the [ORG Government of Israel  ] took extraordinary steps to mitigate civilian casualties , despite [ORG HAMAS  ] 's deliberate use of civilians as human shields . 
He stated that the [ORG IDF  ] made over 300,000 phone calls to alert civilians before bombing legitimate military targets . 
He also compared [MISC Israeli  ] operations in [LOC Gaza  ] to [LOC U.S.  ] operations in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] and stated that [LOC Israel  ] would do whatever was necessary to protect its population . 
In response , [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] recalled [LOC U.S.  ] support for [LOC Israel  ] in handling of the [LOC Goldstone  ] report , and offered to share [LOC U.S.  ] experience in investigating incidents in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] as the [ORG GOI  ] considered whether to conduct an additional investigation. -------------------- Anxiety Over [LOC Turkey  ] -------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [MISC Israeli  ] officials also expressed growing anxiety over the [MISC Turkey-Israel  ] relationship after the [MISC Turkish  ] cancellation of [LOC Israel  ] 's participation in the [MISC ANATOLIAN EAGLE  ] joint exercise . 
They expressed their belief that the strategic relationship with [LOC Turkey  ] is critical , but that PM [PER Erdogan  ] 's views have increasingly penetrated into the military and have been part of the reason for the deterioration in relations as [LOC Turkey  ] looks [PER East  ] rather than [LOC West  ] . 
[PER Gilad  ] believes this is understandable as [LOC Turkey  ] 's [ORG EU  ] accession prospects look increasingly doubtful , and they must balance their relations with both regions to succeed. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Baidatz  ] stated that the [LOC Turks  ] have an agenda to contain any [MISC Kurdish  ] influence in [LOC Iraq  ] and that to achieve it they need to improve their relations with [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Syria  ] . 
In his view , the worst possible outcome would be a new [MISC Turkey-Iran-Syria-Iraq  ] axis in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
[PER Gilad  ] also noted that [LOC Turkey  ] wanted to improve its relationships with [LOC Iran  ] and asserted that it had made some very aggressive plans recently to support [ORG HAMAS  ] . 
However , he had a less pessimistic view than [PER Baidatz  ] , stating that [LOC Turkey  ] had played a positive role in [LOC Iraq  ] and that generally the [LOC Turks'  ] agenda was for a stable [LOC Iraq  ] that would be commercially beneficial to [LOC Turkey  ] . 
[PER Gilad  ] stated that he was skeptical of any political rapprochement between [LOC Israel  ] and [LOC Turkey  ] in the near term , but that [LOC Israel  ] would continue to foster the military-to-military relationship because of its strategic importance. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER Gilad  ] also queried [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] about what [LOC Israel  ] might do to improve its relationship with [LOC Turkey  ] . 
[ORG Vershbow  ] explained that [LOC Turkey  ] wants to be influential in the region and that if it jeopardizes its relationship with [LOC Israel  ] , it will undermine its status and its leverage as an evenhanded mediator . 
He also commented that [PER Erdogan  ] 's ideological views may lead him to focus on [LOC Turkey  ] 's [MISC Islamic  ] neighbors , but he is also a realist who will not want to jeopardize [LOC Turkey  ] 's ties to the [LOC U.S.  ] or [ORG NATO  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Israel  ] should be patient with [LOC Turkey  ] and stay engaged , encouraging the [LOC Turks  ] to play a constructive role in the region . 
He stated that at the upcoming bilateral defense talks between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Turkey  ] in December , he and Under Secretary [PER Flournoy  ] would emphasize the need to improve [MISC Israel-Turkey  ] relations. ---------------------------- Quiet on the [ORG Northern Border  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [MISC Israeli  ] officials remain pleased with the " quiet " nature of its northern border -- something they attribute to the deterrent effect [LOC Israel  ] has built up following OPERATION CAST LEAD and the 2006 war in [LOC Lebano  ] . 
However , according to [MISC Israeli  ] officials , it i a foregone conclusion that strong cooperation eists between the [MISC Lebanese  ] Armed Forces ( [ORG LAF  ] ) and ezbollah . 
The level of cooperation far exceeds wht many assume is simply the day-to-day problem of corruption within the ranks . 
On the contrary , [LOC Israel  ] believes that LAF/Hezbollah cooperation is a matter of national policy . 
[PER Amos Gilad  ] attributed this dynamic to elements of nationalism , stating that [MISC Lebanese  ] government and military officials choose not to confront [ORG Hezbollah  ] out of patriotic zeal . 
Moreover , according to [PER Gilad  ] , any information shared with the [ORG United Nations Interim Force-Lebanon  ] ( [ORG UNIFIL  ] ) goes directly to [ORG Hezbollah  ] by way of the [LOC LAF.  ] <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [MISC Israeli  ] officials have major concerns over developments within [ORG Hezbollah  ] -- specifically , its relationship with [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Iran  ] . 
General [PER Baidatz  ] spoke of this relationship and drew attention to the existing supply of [LOC Fateh-110  ] long-range missile that [LOC Iran  ] sent to [LOC Syria  ] . 
[MISC Israeli  ] officials believe these missiles are destined for [ORG Hezbollah  ] . 
According to [PER Baidatz  ] and others , if the delivery were to occur , this would significantly alter [LOC Israel  ] 's calculus . 
Under such a scenario , the looming question for [MISC Israeli  ] policymakers then becomes: " to strike or not to strike . 
" ----------------- Optimism on [LOC Syria  ] ----------------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) General [PER Baidatz  ] offered an [MISC Israeli  ] intelligence assessment that if [LOC Syria  ] were able to achieve peace with security and obtain greater [LOC U.S.  ] involvement , it may pull away from [LOC Iran  ] 's orbit . 
He explained that President [PER Assad  ] used his " negative assets , " namely [ORG Hezbollah  ] and [ORG HAMAS  ] , to make himself relevant and that ultimately [PER Assad  ] wants it all: the [LOC Golan Heights  ] ; peace with [LOC Israel  ] ; better relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] ; a strong relationship with [LOC Iran  ] ; and a continued relationship with [ORG Hezbollah  ] . 
Ultimately , Gen [PER Baidatz  ] asserted that if [PER Assad  ] had to choose one thing , it would likely be peace with [LOC Israel  ] . 
[ORG ASD Vershbow  ] asked if [ORG Hezbollah  ] could be sustained without [MISC Syrian  ] support . 
[PER Baidatz  ] acknowledged the difficulty in answering this question , but stated his belief that it would be a gradual process before [ORG Hezbollah  ] could completely wean itself from the [MISC Syrian  ] support apparatus and that , ultimately , both [ORG Hezbollah  ] 's and [LOC Iran  ] 's flexibility would be significantly reduced. ------------------------------- Mil-to-Mil Relations with [LOC Egypt  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) [PER Amos Gilad  ] commented that he would like to see a complete peace with [LOC Egypt  ] , but noted there was very little in the way of [MISC Egyptian-Israeli  ] military relations and that [LOC Egypt  ] continued to train its military for war with [LOC Israel  ] . 
[PER Gilad  ] stated that [LOC Egypt  ] was not likely to attack [LOC Israel  ] and did not represent a short-term threat , but that at the very least it was necessary to have modest contact between [MISC Egyptian  ] and [MISC Israeli  ] officers . 
He expressed frustration by describing [LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC Israel  ] 's " frozen peace " and that neither side knows anything about the other . 
He noted that the last high-level military visit for [LOC Egypt  ] was in 1991. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( S//NF ) [MISC Israeli  ] officials agreed that [LOC Egypt  ] 's counter-smuggling efforts have improved , particularly since Operation CAST LEAD in January . 
However , they stated that gaps still exist and that [LOC Egypt  ] needs to focus its efforts on stopping [MISC Bedouin  ] smuggling in the [LOC Sinai  ] . 
[PER Gilad  ] said he was disillusioned with the technical monitoring solution ; tunnels continue and smuggling is increasing even with [LOC U.S.  ] assistance along borders with [LOC Egypt.  ] --------------------------------------------- --------------- [ORG Iron Dome  ] and Juniper Cobra - Strengthening the Relationship --------------------------------------------- --------------- <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) On [ORG Iron Dome  ] , [PER DG Buchris  ] ( Assisted by retired General [PER Nagel  ] ) briefed [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] on the latest developments , stating that [ORG Iron Dome  ] is planned to have an initial operating capability by the spring of 2010 , and that technological advancements have made the system much more viable defending against short range rocket attacks from [LOC Gaza  ] or [LOC Southern Lebanon  ] . 
[PER Buchris  ] also emphasized the need for additional USG support to help fund additional production of [ORG Iron Dome  ] to protect the civilian population in both the [LOC North  ] and the [LOC South  ] . 
[PER Buchris  ] also noted progress on the upper- and medium-tier ballistic missile defense systems ( [MISC Arrow-3  ] and [PER David  ] 's Sling , respectively ) . 
In an earlier meeting , [PER MG Gantz  ] quantified the importance of fielding adequate missile defense systems by citing critical [MISC Israeli  ] infrastructure such as [PER Ben Gurion Airport  ] and the [LOC Ashkelon  ] electricity plant . 
Suffering the loss or damage of places such as these , according to [PER Gantz  ] , would be a major blow to [LOC Israel  ] and , therefore , every effort to stand up a capable missile and rocket defense shield should be taken. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) After [PER Gantz  ] highlighted three areas of focus for the [ORG IDF  ] ( deterring conventional threats , responding nimbly to asymmetric threats , and developing an integrated missile defense system ) , [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] asked for [PER Gantz  ] 's initial impression of the Juniper [MISC Cobra-10  ] exercise . 
[PER Gantz  ] stressed the importance of this exercise , and stated that so far it had been a success . 
[ORG ASD Vershbow  ] stated that the timing of Juniper Cobra was somewhat fortuitous , given the recent developments with [LOC Iran  ] . 
On the larger issue of missile defense , [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] stressed [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to try and persuade [LOC Russia  ] to become more involved in missile defense cooperation , but stated that [LOC Russia  ] 's realization that the new [LOC U.S.  ] missile defense approach in [LOC Europe  ] is more effective than the previous one is causing the [MISC Russian  ] leadership to ask many questions about the system. ------- Summary ------- <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) All of [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] 's interlocutors carried a consistent message emphasizing that: [LOC Iran  ] remains [LOC Israel  ] 's greatest threat ; recent events have weakened President [PER Abbas  ] ; the PASF have performed well in the [LOC West Bank  ] ; and the relative calm on all [LOC Israel  ] 's borders does not obscure the fact that [MISC Israeli  ] intelligence is seeing significant activity and planning by [MISC Iranian  ] surrogates , namely [ORG HAMAS  ] and [ORG Hezbollah  ] , with facilitation from [LOC Syria  ] . 
These threats suggest that [LOC Israel  ] must remain vigilant and prepared for the calm to end one day. <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( U ) [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] has cleared this message .
