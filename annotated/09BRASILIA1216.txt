<code><pre>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 04 [LOC BRASILIA  ] 001216 SIPDIS DEPARTMENT FOR S/CT [PER SHARI VILLAROSA  ] AND WHA . 
EO 12958 DECL: 10/02/2019 TAGS PREL , PGOV , PTER , PINR , BR SUBJECT: BRAZIL: SCENESETTER FOR OCTOBER 5-7 VISIT OF S/CT DEPUTY COORDINATOR OF REGIONAL AFFAIRS [PER SHARI VILLAROSA REF: A. A.  ] [LOC BRASILIA  ] 01206 B. [PER B. BRASILIA  ] 00156 [PER C. C.  ] [LOC BRASILIA  ] 01095 [ORG Classified By: Political Counselor  ] [PER Steve Liston  ] , reason: 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) ------------- Introduction ------------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) The relationship between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] is as productive and broad-based as it has ever been in recent decades , the result of the cordial personal connection already established between President [PER Obama  ] and President [PER Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  ] , which is building on [PER Lula  ] , s excellent relationship with former President [PER Bush  ] . 
New cooperation mechanisms on biofuels , business issues , and economic matters , and our shared goals of fostering hemispheric stability , promoting democracy , developing a consensus on next steps for climate change , and achieving a mutually satisfactory conclusion to the [LOC Doha  ] round of WTO negotiations have fostered the view in [LOC Brazil  ] that relations between our two countries are closer than ever . 
[LOC Brazil  ] appears to be headed for a rapid recovery from the effects of the global financial crisis , and [PER Lula  ] remains as popular as ever as the country turns its focus on the race to succeed him in January 2011. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Internationally , U.S.-Brazil cooperation is often limited by the [ORG GOB  ] , s unwillingness to speak out against anti-democratic actions in the hemisphere ( [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] ) , take proactive steps to address key issues such as nuclear nonproliferation and counterterrorism concerns , and expand its international leadership in meaningful ways . 
However , military-to-military relations are good and growing , and most of the [MISC Brazilian  ] military understands the potential benefits of partnership with the [LOC United States  ] . 
At the operational level , cooperation on law enforcement issues , such as counternarcotics , container security , and intelligence sharing , is excellent and improving . 
As the most senior official in S/CT to visit [LOC Brazil  ] in several years , your visit provides an opportunity to highlight the importance of a regional approach to counterterrorism efforts and to explore new avenues for cooperation in that field. -------------------- [ORG Counterterrorism: Operational Partnership  ] , [ORG Policy Intransigence  ] , Legal Weakness -------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) The primary counterterrorism concern for both [MISC Brazilian  ] officials and the [LOC U.S. Mission  ] in [LOC Brazil  ] is the presence and activities of individuals with links to terrorism-particularly several suspected [PER Sunni extremists  ] and some individuals linked to [LOC Hizballah-in Sao Paulo  ] and other areas of southern [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Despite publicly expressed sentiments of high-level officials denying the existence of proven terrorist activity on [MISC Brazilian  ] soil , [LOC Brazil  ] , s intelligence and law enforcement services are rightly concerned that terrorists could exploit [MISC Brazilian  ] territory to support and facilitate terrorist attacks , whether domestically or abroad , and have focused their efforts in the areas of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , where the vast majority of [LOC Brazil  ] , s estimated 1.2-1.5 million [MISC Muslims  ] live ; [LOC Brazil  ] , s tri-border areas with [LOC Argentina  ] and [LOC Paraguay  ] and with [LOC Peru  ] and [LOC Colombia  ] ; and its borders with [LOC Colombia  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
[LOC Brazil  ] , s recognition of the potential threat from terrorism prompted a reform of the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Intelligence Agency  ] ( [ORG ABIN  ] ) that raised the profile of the issue by upgrading the counterterrorism division to the department level and establishing the [MISC Brazilian  ] Intelligence System ( [ORG SISBIN  ] ) -an NCTC-like entity within [ORG ABIN  ] to coordinate intelligence gathering and sharing across the [ORG GOB.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) During an early July 2009 hearing before a [ORG Congressional  ] committee ( ref A ) , the [MISC Brazilian  ] Federal Police , s head of intelligence publicly admitted that [MISC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] had performed duties for the terrorist group , ranging from propaganda , to logistics , recruitment , and other activities . 
Because [LOC Brazil  ] lacks counterterrorism legislation , the [ORG DPF  ] arrested him on charges of hate crimes , which carry a much lighter sentence. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Brazilian  ] government continues to be a cooperative partner in countering terrorism and related activities that could contribute to the facilitation of attacks in the region or elsewhere-to include investigating potential terrorism financing , document forgery networks , and other illicit activity . 
Operationally , elements of the [ORG GOB  ] responsible for combating terrorism -- the Federal Police , Customs , and to a lesser extent [ORG ABIN  ] -- effectively work with their [LOC U.S.  ] counterparts and diligently pursue investigative leads provided by [LOC U.S.  ] intelligence , law enforcement , and financial agencies regarding terrorist suspects . 
The senior levels of the [MISC Brazilian  ] government , however , publicly deny the possibility that terrorist groups or individuals connected to such groups operate or transit through [MISC Brazilian  ] soil and vigorously protest any claims made by [LOC U.S.  ] authorities to that effect. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [MISC Brazilian  ] government and non-government elite shows particular sensitivity when [ORG USG  ] officials raise a key issues , including the re-establishment of the [MISC Fourth Fleet  ] , sovereignty over their recent off-shore sub-salt oil discoveries and the [LOC Amazon  ] , and the status of indigenous people and lands . 
Terrorism and the Argentina-Brazil-Paraguay [PER Tri-Border Area  ] ( [ORG TBA  ] ) are also sensitive in government circles . 
-- Terrorism . 
Officially , [LOC Brazil  ] does not have terrorism inside its borders . 
In reality , several [MISC Islamic  ] groups with known or suspected ties to extremist organizations have branches in [LOC Brazil  ] and are suspected of carrying out financing activities . 
Although there is good working-level law enforcement cooperation between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] on terrorism related activities , the official position of the government is to deny that [LOC Brazil  ] has any terrorist activity . 
-- [PER Tri-Border Area  ] ( [ORG TBA  ] ) . 
Related to the above , [MISC Brazilian  ] officials rebuff any suggestion by [LOC U.S.  ] officials that there is terrorist activity in the [ORG TBA  ] . 
A frequent [MISC Brazilian  ] retort to comments about the [ORG TBA  ] is , “Which one ? 
We have nine tri-border areas.” As we are generally unable to share intelligence regarding terrorism-related activities , the [ORG USG  ] is regularly accused of making unsupported assertions that malign [ORG TBA  ] residents and have a negative impact on tourism in the region . 
The [ORG GOB  ] insists there is no proven terrorist activity in the [ORG TBA  ] and , in its defense , points to statements to that effect in the repeated joint communiques out of the annual 3 [ORG Plus  ] 1 meetings. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Brazil  ] , s overall commitment to combating terrorism and the illicit activities that could be exploited to facilitate terrorism is undermined by the [ORG GOB  ] , s failure to significantly strengthen its legal counterterrorism framework . 
Two key counterterrorism-related legislative initiatives continued to languish in 2009 . 
An anti-terrorism bill that would have established the crime of terrorism and other associated crimes was drafted but shelved before its introduction in [ORG Congress  ] and a long-delayed anti-money laundering bill has not been approved by [ORG Congress  ] . 
If passed , the latter bill would facilitate greater law enforcement access to financial and banking records during investigations , criminalize illicit enrichment , allow administrative freezing of assets , and facilitate prosecutions of money laundering cases by amending the legal definition of money laundering and making it an autonomous offense. -------------------- [ORG Counterterrorism: Making  ] the 3 [ORG Plus  ] 1 Work -------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The 3 [ORG Plus  ] 1 Mechanism ( ref b ) on Security in the [ORG TBA  ] of [LOC Argentina  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] , and [LOC Paraguay  ] remains , six years after its initial plenary session , the only instrument available to discuss [LOC CT  ] with regional partners at the policy level . 
Given [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001216 003 OF 004 the likelihood that the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] ( [ORG Itamaraty  ] ) will reject new policy-level proposals for regional security cooperation as the [ORG GOB  ] focuses on building up a regional security architecture in [LOC South America  ] that does not include the [LOC United States  ] ( i.e. , Mercosul working groups on security , [LOC UNASUL  ] , [MISC South American Defense Council  ] ) , re-invigorating the 3 [ORG Plus  ] 1 becomes all the more necessary , both as a means of achieving meaningful policy-level commitments from [LOC Brazil  ] on this important issue and as a way of maintaining a foothold in regional security discussions . 
The [LOC United States  ] , turn to host the upcoming 3 [ORG Plus  ] 1 offers the best opportunity since the initial plenary to shift the dynamics of the mechanism in a way that ensures its effectiveness and our broader security interest in the region . 
Taking advantage of greater [ORG GOB  ] openness to the new [ORG U.S. Administration  ] , a concerted [ORG USG  ] strategy to implement this new approach that includes careful inter-agency preparation and high-level participation could lay the groundwork for the [ORG GOB  ] to accept expanding the scope of the 3 [ORG Plus  ] 1-substantively , geographically , or both-to make it a more effective regional security dialogue. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The history of the 3 [ORG Plus  ] 1 suggests that it will require careful planning and execution to make it a truly effective forum for cooperation . 
The [MISC Brazilians  ] have been consistent in limiting discussions on topics that are not within the established and narrow confines of the 3 [ORG Plus  ] 1 ( only counterterrorism , only [ORG TBA  ] ) , and have made it nearly impossible for the [ORG USG  ] to propose projects for the four partners to undertake jointly. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) During SouthCom Commander General [PER Douglas Fraser  ] , s visit to [LOC Brazil  ] July 29-31 ( ref c ) [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] Under Secretary for Political Affairs I Amb . 
[PER Vera Machado  ] said [LOC Brazil  ] , s “great concern” was the control of transnational illicit activities , nothing that this area is very sensitive , as it is seen by some as having this potential to lead to external interference in domestic affairs . 
[ORG Foreign Ministry Transnational Crimes  ] Director Minister [PER Virginia Toniatti  ] raised the 3 [ORG Plus  ] 1 security forum for the [ORG TBA  ] , noting that WHA DAS [PER Chris McMullen  ] had struck the right tone in their January 2008 meeting by not speaking about terrorism in the border but rather talking about broader illicit activities . 
( Comment: This is the same person who in the past has often insisted that 3 [ORG Plus  ] 1 could discuss nothing but counterterrorism , and who has effectively derailed productive dialogue at the 3 [ORG Plus  ] 1 meetings . 
End comment . 
) Stressing how much she disliked the term “tri-border area , ” as it suggested an uncontrolled area when in fact each country exercised control up to its own borders , [PER Toniatti  ] nonetheless said that [LOC Brazil  ] is ready to work with its neighbors and the [LOC United States  ] in a concrete way to address confirmed illicit activities . 
She rejected unsupported assertions made by [ORG USG  ] officials of support for terrorist activity in the region , which only serve to stigmatize it . 
She noted that there had so far been no evidence of terrorist activity or finance in the region and that all of the 3 [ORG Plus  ] 1 declarations had explicitly states as much. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Despite these difficulties , the 3 [ORG Plus  ] 1 mechanism serves several important purposes . 
Policy-level dialogue: Although law enforcement cooperation with [LOC Brazil  ] has always been excellent and fluid at the operational level , 3 [ORG Plus  ] 1 is the only sub-regional discussion on these issues in which we participate at a policy level . 
[ORG Networking: Members  ] of the [ORG Mission  ] , s [ORG Law Enforcement Working Group  ] ( [ORG LEWG  ] ) -- which includes [ORG DEA  ] , [ORG DHS  ] ( ICE , CBP , and [ORG USSS  ] ) , DOj ( [ORG FBI  ] , [ORG RLA  ] ) , DOD ( [ORG DAO  ] , [ORG MLO  ] ) , and State -- who have attended the 3 [ORG Plus  ] 1 sessions see value in the networking possibilities created through the mechanism . 
[ORG Accountability:  ] The 3 [ORG Plus  ] 1 allows us the opportunity to question [LOC Brazil  ] and other partners as to what progress they have made to comply with basic international norms , and to remind them of their international obligations . 
Information sharing: [ORG Mission  ] believes much of this information is valuable for understanding what the [ORG GOB  ] is doing independently and jointly with its neighbors , not all of which is information we receive through other contacts or in the vetted and open way in which it is reported at 3 [ORG Plus  ] 1 . 
Moral suasion: [MISC Brazilian  ] government officials repeatedly cite their participation in the 3 [ORG Plus  ] 1 as a measure of their commitment to combat terrorist activity in the region . 
To the extent that [ORG GOB  ] puts value on the 3 [ORG Plus  ] 1 , it provides some leverage to encourage [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001216 004 OF 004 [LOC Brazil  ] to be a positive partner. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) As a result of these benefits , [ORG Mission Brazil  ] believes 3 [ORG Plus  ] 1 mechanism should be maintained . 
But we also need to look for ways to make it more effective . 
We see two main options for improving the mechanism: a somewhat simpler but less satisfactory evolution to a broader [ORG TBA  ] agenda , or a more difficult and ambitious effort at restructuring the 3 [ORG Plus  ] 1 into a country-wide counter-crime forum . 
( See ref C for more detail on [ORG Mission  ] proposals . 
) -------------------- Moving Forward on [ORG CT Cooperation  ] -------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) High-level , long-term [ORG USG  ] commitment to engaging [LOC Brazil  ] on counterterrorism , including in the 3 [ORG Plus  ] 1 , will be necessary to build a productive [LOC CT  ] relationship above the operational level . 
Although we expect limited results until a new [ORG GOB Administration  ] takes office in 2011 , your visit provides an excellent opportunity to reiterate the high priority that the [ORG Obama Administration  ] gives to this issue , frame the discussion toward a more productive relationship , and explore possibilities for policy-level cooperation. . 
Your visit also serves as an opportunity to push [LOC U.S.  ] goals and regain momentum in advance of the upcoming 3 [ORG Plus  ] 1 meeting .
