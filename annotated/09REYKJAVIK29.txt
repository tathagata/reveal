End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Ambassador called on [LOC Iceland  ] 's new Prime Minister [PER Johanna Sigurdardottir  ] on February 5 to deliver a congratulatory letter from [LOC U.S.  ] President [PER Obama  ] ( Ref A ) . 
Expressing warm thanks and deep admiration for President [PER Obama  ] and " what he stands for , " [PER Sigurdardottir  ] said she looks forward to the possibility of meeting the President as well as Secretary [PER Clinton  ] at the [ORG NATO  ] Summit to be held in [LOC Strasbourg  ] this April . 
[PER Sigurdardottir  ] drew parallels between [PER Obama  ] 's campaign for change and the changes represented by her own government , the first in [MISC Icelandic  ] history to be headed by a woman and to have an equal gender balance in the cabinet . 
[PER Sigurdardottir  ] claimed the new government is only the third in the world to have an equal allocation of cabinet posts between men and women. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Sigurdardottir  ] said her government -- which will be in office for roughly 80 days before early parliamentary elections this spring -- realizes it will need to work " 24-7 " to accomplish its ambitious agenda . 
The first priority is to reconstruct and reorganize the banking sector , with particular attention to regulatory bodies such as the [ORG Central Bank  ] and the [ORG Financial Supervisory Authority  ] . 
This must be done in order to rebuild international trust in [LOC Iceland  ] , which has been greatly weakened as a result of the crisis . 
At the same time , said this former Social Affairs Minister , the government will work to mitigate the impact of the economic contraction on [MISC Icelandic  ] households. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The PM pledged that her government will fully implement the plan worked out with the [ORG International Monetary Fund  ] ( [ORG IMF  ] ) last fall , which will be the key to [LOC Iceland  ] 's economic recovery . 
She added that the government intends to stand by all international commitments that [LOC Iceland  ] has made in connection with the economic crisis. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Ambassador raised the topic of bilateral security cooperation and the work done by both governments to develop a new defense relationship after the withdrawal of [LOC U.S.  ] forces in 2006 . 
The Ambassador expressed gratitude for the work done by previous Foreign Minister ( and Chair of [PER Sigurdardottir  ] 's Social [ORG Democratic Alliance  ] party ) [PER Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir  ] and said she hoped our strong bilateral cooperation could continue . 
The PM said she agreed that [MISC U.S.-Iceland  ] defense ties have been strong and that continued joint efforts would be beneficial. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On whaling , Ambassador noted the decision by the outgoing Minister of Fisheries in his final days in office to dramatically increase the quota for commercial hunting of fin and minke whales ( ref B ) . 
PM [PER Sigurdardottir  ] said her government had strongly criticized the manner in which this was done , in which a minister in caretaker status made such a dramatic change to government policy . 
The PM has asked the new Minister of Finance , Fisheries and Agriculture to review the legal basis for the quota increase and examine how it might be rescinded . 
She noted that there may be some liability concerns for the government arising from companies that already hold whaling quotas and could sue for damages . 
The PM further noted that her government has received a large number of letters and email messages protesting the decision , many of them from the [LOC U.S.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment and bio note: [PER Sigurdardottir  ] appears to have brought the same intensity and seriousness of purpose to her new job that she exhibited in her previous stints as Minister of Social Welfare -- the very qualities that have made her the most popular politician in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
She is focused on domestic issues first and foremost , but also showed on the [ORG IMF  ] package and whaling that she [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000029 002 OF 002 understands the outside world cannot be ignored while [LOC Iceland  ] looks inward . 
Of note , although [PER Sigurdardottir  ] is fluent in [MISC English  ] , she chose to speak in [MISC Icelandic  ] and use an interpreter .
