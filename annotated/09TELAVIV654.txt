( [ORG S  ] ) Summary . 
MFA Deputy Director General for the [LOC Middle East  ] Yacov [PER Hadas  ] provided PolCouns March 16 with an overview of [LOC Israel  ] 's relations with several of the [LOC Gulf  ] states . 
[PER Hadas  ] described [LOC Israel  ] 's relations with the [LOC Gulf  ] as a function of the [MISC Gulf Arabs'  ] fear of [LOC Iran  ] , but also as due to the [MISC Arabs'  ] belief in [MISC Israeli  ] influence in [LOC Washington  ] . 
Fleshing out some of the points he had made earlier to [ORG NEA  ] Acting [PER A/S Feltman  ] ( reftel ) , [PER Hadas  ] described [LOC Qatar  ] 's shift toward the radical camp in the region as a " game " linked to [MISC Qatari  ] rivalry with [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
[PER Hadas  ] believes [LOC Qatar  ] is feeling pressure from [LOC Israel  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] and the [MISC Saudis  ] , adding that he has been invited to visit [LOC Doha  ] for talks about how to resume normal [MISC Qatari-Israeli  ] ties . 
[PER Hadas  ] noted that while the [LOC Omanis  ] are generally correct in their dealings with [LOC Israel  ] , they appear not to recognize the seriousness of the threat from [LOC Iran  ] . 
He said that while the [LOC UAE  ] is increasingly hostile to [LOC Iran  ] , it remains unclear how far they are willing to go in terms of increasing financial pressures on [LOC Tehran  ] . 
[PER Hadas  ] said the [MISC Gulf Arabs  ] feel that the [LOC U.S.  ] does not listen to them and therefore sometimes try to pass messages through [LOC Israel  ] . 
While he agreed that progress on the [MISC Palestinian  ] track would make it easier for the [LOC Gulf  ] states to be open about their ties to [LOC Israel  ] , he cautioned that the [LOC Gulf  ] states use the peace process as an " excuse not to take action " against [LOC Iran  ] or in support of the [LOC PA  ] . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) PolCouns called on Deputy Director General for the [LOC Middle East  ] Yacov [PER Hadas  ] March 16 to follow up on Hadas' March 4 discussion with Acting [PER A/S Feltman  ] of [MISC Israeli-Gulf  ] relations . 
Beginning with [LOC Qatar  ] , [PER Hadas  ] said there were signs that various pressures on the [MISC Qataris  ] were starting to have an effect . 
[PER Hadas  ] noted that [LOC Qatar  ] could only get its humanitarian relief supplies into [LOC Gaza  ] through [LOC Israel  ] . 
[MISC Qatari  ] diplomats assigned to their [LOC Gaza  ] consulate also had to cross through [LOC Israel  ] since [LOC Egypt  ] would not allow them to enter [LOC Gaza  ] from [LOC Rafah  ] . 
For now , the [MISC Israelis  ] are not allowing either [MISC Qatari  ] assistance or personnel to cross into [LOC Gaza  ] . 
[PER Hadas  ] noted that he had been invited to visit [LOC Doha  ] to discuss reopening the [MISC Israeli  ] trade office , which he saw as a positive sign . 
He added that the [MISC Qataris  ] needed to understand that they could not expect to restore cooperative relations with [LOC Israel  ] without agreeing to reopen the trade office. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) While [PER Hadas  ] was critical of the [MISC Qataris'  ] treatment of [LOC Israel  ] since the [LOC Gaza  ] operation , he stressed that he thought [LOC Qatar  ] 's policies were not a matter of a shift in ideology toward the radical camp , but linked to their rivalry with the [MISC Saudis  ] and , by extension , with [LOC Egypt  ] . 
In private settings , [PER Hadas  ] noted that the [MISC Qatari  ] leadership harbored " no illusions " about [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Prince Hamad  ] had told the [MISC Israelis  ] in October 2006 that he believed [LOC Iran  ] was determined to develop a nuclear bomb no matter the cost . 
According to [PER Hadas  ] , [PER Hamad  ] complained at the time that he felt the [LOC U.S.  ] would not listen to him and tended to believe what it heard from [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Hadas  ] reiterated the point he had made to [PER Feltman  ] regarding [LOC Oman  ] , calling the [LOC Omanis  ] the " most problematic " of the [LOC Gulf  ] states in terms of their view of [LOC Iran  ] . 
With regard to [MISC Omani  ] contacts with [LOC Israel  ] , [PER Hadas  ] said they were " correct , " but the [LOC Omanis  ] never fulfilled their commitment to open an [MISC Israeli  ] office in [LOC Muscat  ] . 
He said [LOC Oman  ] has " its own definition " of what poses a threat to the [LOC Gulf  ] , partly due to [LOC Oman  ] 's geographical location . 
He did not think [LOC Oman  ] would be willing to join the rest of the [ORG GCC  ] against [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Hadas  ] agreed that the [LOC UAE  ] was increasingly hostile to [LOC Iran  ] , but there remained a question as to how far they were prepared to go . 
The [LOC UAE  ] has extensive trade and financial relations with [LOC Iran  ] , including money laundering , and it was unclear whether they were ready to use these relations as leverage . 
Foreign Minister [PER Sheikh Abdallah  ] has developed good personal relations with Foreign Minister [PER Livni  ] , but the [MISC Emiratis  ] are " not ready to do publicly what they say in private . 
" ( [PER Note: It  ] was clear from Hadas' remarks that [LOC Israel  ] 's channel to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] does not run through the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Hadas  ] said the [MISC Gulf Arabs  ] believe in [LOC Israel  ] 's role because of their perception of [LOC Israel  ] 's close relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] but also due to their sense that they can count on [LOC Israel  ] against [LOC Iran  ] . 
" They believe [LOC Israel  ] can work magic , " [PER Hadas  ] commented . 
When considering a trilateral [MISC U.S.-Israel-GCC  ] partnership , [PER Hadas  ] suggested we bear in mind that [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program is the primary source of concern to the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Israel  ] , while the [MISC Gulf Arabs  ] also worry about [LOC Iran  ] for a host of historic and sectarian reasons. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) PolCouns noted that [MISC Arabs  ] say that progress on the [MISC Palestinian  ] track would make it easier for them to publicly engage [LOC Israel  ] . 
[PER Hadas  ] countered that while peace with the [MISC Palestinians  ] is an [MISC Israeli  ] interest and important in its own right , it should not be the sum total of [LOC Israel  ] 's relations with the [ORG Arab World  ] . 
[ORG Arab League Secretary General  ] [PER Amre Moussa  ] had invented the " never-ending hurdle race " in which [LOC Israel  ] could never do enough to deserve a positive response . 
The [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] track should not serve as an excuse for the [LOC Gulf  ] to avoid action , whether against [LOC Iran  ] or through practical steps to support the [MISC Palestinian  ] Authority. ********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy [LOC Tel Aviv  ] 's Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv ********************************************* ******************** CUNNINGHAM</pre></code>
