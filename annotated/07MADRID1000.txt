( [ORG SBU  ] ) On May 24 [MISC Spanish  ] investigative magistrate Judge [PER Santiago Pedraz  ] rejected the appeal of [ORG National Court Chief  ] Prosecutor [PER Javier Zaragoza  ] to drop the charges against three [LOC U.S.  ] servicemen accused of killing [MISC Spanish  ] television cameraman [PER Jose Couso  ] during a firefight in [LOC Baghdad  ] in April <a id='par2003' href='#par2003'>¶</a>2003 . 
Despite the rejection by Judge [PER Pedraz  ] , this case will proceed to the [ORG National Court  ] appeals tribunal , which will rule on the merits of the arguments put forth by [PER Pedraz  ] and by the [ORG National Court  ] prosecutors . 
As we reported in [LOC REFTEL A  ] , [PER Zaragoza  ] contacted us on May 14 to report that he had appealed the [PER Pedraz  ] decision to file formal charges against the three servicemen , saying that his technical and legal review of the facts led him to conclude that the killing of [PER Couso  ] was not intentional , and therefore the soldiers could not be charged with war crimes or murder . 
In today 's ruling Judge [PER Pedraz  ] claimed to be surprised by [PER Zaragoza  ] 's appeal , as the [ORG National Prosecutors Office  ] did not oppose his initial ruling to reactivate arrest warrants for the servicemen and therefore tacitly agreed with the case. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment . 
Today 's ruling by [PER Pedraz  ] was not a surprise as judges do not normally change their original ruling after an appeal based on the technical or legal review of the [ORG National Court Prosecutors Office  ] . 
This case , as we expected , will now be forwarded to the [ORG Criminal Division  ] of the [ORG National Court  ] . 
Post will continue to report on this case as it develops .
