[ORG MADRID  ] 1021 [ORG MADRID  ] 00001280 001.2 OF 003 Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission [PER Arnold A. Chacon  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY: A hot issue in the [MISC Spanish  ] press since 2005 , the detainee transfer flights that allegedly transited [LOC Spain  ] from 2002 until 2006 have once again hit the headlines . 
The most recent flurry of reporting began November 30 when [ORG El Pais  ] , [LOC Spain  ] 's leading newspaper , printed several stories based on internal [ORG GOS  ] documents purporting to relate [LOC U.S.  ] requests in 2002 for permission to use [MISC Spanish  ] airports should an emergency arise on flights transporting terrorism detainees to [LOC Guantanamo  ] . 
Although [ORG GOS  ] officials past and present continue to deny knowledge of any illegality , this long-running saga could have implications for our Agreement on [ORG Defense Cooperation  ] ( [ORG ADC  ] ) . 
END SUMMARY . 
The Story that [MISC Will Not Die  ] --------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [LOC Guantanamo  ] detainee flight story has long since become a press staple in [LOC Spain  ] . 
The story appears on front pages ( starting in [ORG El Pais  ] ) and disappears every two or three months . 
An investigation is underway in a [MISC Spanish  ] court , brought by an NGO which claims illegally detained persons were transported via [LOC Spain  ] . 
The press reporting almost invariably mixes so-called " [ORG CIA  ] flights " and [LOC U.S.  ] military flights via [LOC Rota  ] and [LOC Moron  ] ( of which there are thousands annually ) indiscriminantly . 
It also draws heavily on claims by various [ORG NGOs  ] interested in [LOC Guantanamo  ] and presents their allegations as fact ( e.g. , lists of aircraft tail numbers from planes alleged to have passed through [LOC Spain  ] carrying detainees ) . 
The progress of the case appears desultory and that translates into a periodic rash of stories each time the judge receives new information , say from air traffic control authorities or the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG MOD  ] . 
Naturally , no allowance is made in the press for the fact that [LOC Guantanamo  ] , aside from being home to the detention facility , is also a [LOC U.S.  ] military base visited by routine logistical flights . 
Leaks ----- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The current iteration of the story is the most virulent so far . 
It began November 30 when [ORG El Pais  ] reported a document recounting a 2002 meeting between the then-Spanish [ORG MFA  ] Director General for [LOC North America  ] and the Embassy 's [PER Political-Military Counselor  ] ( [ORG NFI  ] ) in which the [LOC U.S.  ] asked to use [LOC Spain  ] as an emergency landing destination for flights moving detainees from [LOC Afghanistan  ] to [LOC Guantanamo  ] . 
The newspaper also described a second document from the same [ORG MFA  ] official , addressed to the [ORG MOD  ] Secretary General for [ORG Defense Policy  ] , expressing the [ORG MFA  ] 's willingness to grant the [LOC U.S.  ] request and suggesting use of a " discreet " military airport such as [LOC Moron  ] . 
In a related article December 3 , [ORG El Pais  ] published a February 2007 letter from the [MISC Spanish  ] President of the joint [ORG Permanent Committee  ] which manages implementation of the [ORG ADC  ] , asking the [LOC U.S.  ] section to confirm that the [LOC U.S.  ] was in compliance with Article 25.2 of the [ORG ADC  ] with respect to [LOC U.S.  ] military flights to and from [LOC Guantanamo  ] ( that article exempts from blanket flight clearances any plane carrying persons or cargo that would be controversial for [LOC Spain  ] ) . 
The newspaper also published the [LOC U.S.  ] section response , which was in the affirmative . 
( Note: In March 2007 , the [ORG MOD  ] decided that all flights to and from [LOC Guantanamo  ] would require individual clearances ; that is the procedure in use today ) . 
Know Nothings ------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Trying to get ahead of the story , [PER FM Moratinos  ] announced December 1 the formation of an independent investigative team including the [ORG Chiefs of Staff  ] to the [ORG FM  ] , the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs , and the Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs as well as the [ORG FM  ] 's parliamentary advisor . 
On December 2 , [PER Moratinos  ] confirmed press reports the investigative team has not been able to locate the original of the 2002 document described in paragraph 1 ( although [ORG El Pais  ] has printed a facsimile ) . 
This has only added to the government 's embarrassment. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) President [PER Zapatero  ] and his cabinet have let it be [ORG MADRID  ] 00001280 002.2 OF 003 known that they had no knowledge of any arrangements the previous administration ( that of [PER Jose Maria Aznar  ] ) might have made with the [LOC U.S.  ] This tactic could be effective but is blunted by allegations the flights continued into 2006 , well into [PER Zapatero  ] 's first term . 
Given the Socialists' consistent , outspoken anti-Guantanamo line , it would be a political disaster if they were shown to have winked at detainee flights . 
It would be only somewhat less damaging if they were perceived to be so incompetent they did not notice the flights . 
[PER Moratinos  ] has denied any knowledge . 
Two former [PER Zapatero MODs  ] , current President of [MISC Congress  ] [PER Jose Bono  ] and current senior [ORG Socialist Party  ] congressional spokesman [PER Jose Antonio Alonso  ] , have said they knew of no illegal [LOC U.S.  ] activity in [LOC Spain  ] . 
The opposition [ORG Popular Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] -- the party [PER Aznar  ] led ) has accused the [PER Zapatero  ] administration of leaking documents in an effort to discredit them and to distract public attention from [PER Zapatero  ] 's alleged mishandling of the ailing [MISC Spanish  ] economy . 
The [ORG PP  ] has also pointed out that of two of the alleged flights occurred under [PER Aznar  ] and nine came under [PER Zapatero  ] 's presidency . 
[ORG PP  ] leader [PER Mariano Rajoy  ] has told the press he knew nothing about the flights , although he was [ORG First Vice  ] President in [PER Aznar  ] 's government at the time of the alleged agreement . 
A unsubstantiated rumor claims the leaker is the head of [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG National Intelligence Center  ] who is allegedly trying to pressure his former mentor [PER Bono  ] into supporting a renewal of his term as director . 
We put little credence in such rumors , but they give a sense of how heated this has become . 
Adding to [PER Zapatero  ] 's discomfort , the small but noisy far-left party ( [ORG United Left  ] ) is in full cry over the story . 
Subpoenas ? ---------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The prosecutor handling the related court case indicated last year that there was no plan to request information from the [ORG USG  ] ( ref a ) . 
However , the latest round of stories has included speculation that the court might seek testimony from [PER Aznar  ] and members of his administration as well as from [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy officials . 
We have received no official notification of any such requests , and consider it unlikely . 
Comment ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Beyond the fact that it sells newspapers , there are a variety of reasons for this story , s longevity . 
Although anti-Americanism in [LOC Spain  ] is more theoretical than practical ( the [MISC Spanish  ] people fundamentally like the [LOC U.S.  ] and want strong relations , and the [MISC Spanish  ] government is anxious to establish closer ties with the incoming [ORG U.S. Administration  ] ) , there remains an important segment in the media that is old-school [MISC European  ] left . 
More importantly , the left-of-center press here enjoys bashing [PER Aznar  ] and his party , especially for their support for the war in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Additionally , although itself left-of-center , [ORG El Pais  ] has its differences with [PER Zapatero  ] and may not mind inflicting pain on him as well as [PER Aznar  ] . 
Neither is [ORG El Pais  ] very fond of [ORG Moratinos.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Whatever the motive , the continual media muddling of so-called " [ORG CIA  ] flights " and [LOC U.S.  ] military flights is unhelpful . 
The [ORG ADC  ] provides us the extremely valuable use of two military bases in southern [LOC Spain  ] midway between the continental [LOC U.S.  ] and the theaters of operation in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] . 
To the extent our [ORG ADC  ] -- which generally receives little public attention in [LOC Spain  ] -- is hauled onto the front pages in connection with the detention facility at [LOC Guantanamo  ] , we run the risk of seeing political support for the [ORG ADC  ] and our mil-mil relationship undermined . 
By unfortunate coincidence , the [ORG ADC  ] was already in the press in recent weeks thanks to [ORG MOD  ] Chacon , s repeated references to her hope that the [LOC U.S.  ] would elevate it to the level of a treaty ( septel ) . <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) In general , we have taken the approach that the less said by us to the press on the overflight topic , the better . 
The [ORG MFA  ] North [PER America Desk  ] has told us in the past that they strongly prefer the Embassy not say anything , fearing it might stir the pot . 
In any case , our ability to beat down this story is constrained by the fact that we do not ourselves know , factually , what might have transpired five or six years ago as the battles in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] began [ORG MADRID  ] 00001280 003.2 OF 003 yielding large numbers of potentially dangerous terrorist detainees and unlawful combatants . 
Naturally , we are not going to answer questions on the activities of intelligence agencies , so in any conversation about these issues we run the risk of appearing less than transparent and thus seeming to confirm the media , s worst insinuations . 
When we do speak publicly on the issue , our mantra is that we have not violated [MISC Spanish  ] law and have complied fully with the [ORG ADC  ] . 
Needless to say , we decline to comment on any leaked internal GOS documents . 
We also try at every opportunity to make the larger point about the war on terror and the very difficult choices that are faced when the [LOC U.S.  ] captures suspected terrorists on foreign battlefields . 
Frankly , this is a losing argument with a [MISC Spanish  ] public that -- although attuned to the dangers of terrorism -- largely rejects the muscular [LOC U.S.  ] approach to fighting it overseas. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Thus far , the [ORG MOD  ] and [ORG MFA  ] have done a reasonably good job in their public affairs efforts of making clear that they do not believe we have violated the [ORG ADC  ] . 
The [ORG MOD  ] issued a December 2 statement saying it knew of no [LOC U.S.  ] military flights that were either illegal or in violation of our bilateral agreements ( this echoes what [ORG MOD  ] officials have told us privately -- e.g. ref b ) . 
However , we have no illusions . 
Politicians are not going to throw themselves on a grenade to protect a predecessor government they despise . 
More than anything , these stories are directed at [PER Aznar  ] and his party , and the damage to [LOC U.S.  ] interests is in some measure collateral. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Our guess is that the story will continue to rear its head every month or two for the foreseeable future . 
It is irresistible copy for [MISC Spanish  ] editors , and [PER Aznar  ] is the left , s favorite bogeyman . 
The court case , winding its way slowly through the system , also provides periodic opportunities to revive it . 
Also , the release in the [LOC U.S.  ] at some point in the future of information relating [LOC Guantanamo  ] and [LOC Spain  ] would certainly generate renewed press interest here . 
Baring a categorical statement from the [ORG USG  ] that no detainees passed through [LOC Spain  ] -- and we understand that might be undesirable from a policy standpoint even if factually correct -- nothing but time is going to make this go away .
