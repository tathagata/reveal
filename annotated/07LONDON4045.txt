( C ) Summary . 
EUR Senior Advisor for [ORG Muslim Engagement  ] [PER Farah Pandith  ] and S/P Member [PER Jared Cohen  ] met with a wide range of [LOC UK  ] government leaders , community activists , think tanks , artists , and [MISC Muslim  ] youth during their October 9-14 visit to the [LOC UK  ] . 
Government officials stressed that the [MISC UK’s  ] problem with extremists is a domestic as well as a foreign policy issue , since all recent successful and thwarted terrorist attacks were perpetrated by individuals from [MISC Muslim  ] communities in the [LOC UK  ] . 
[MISC Muslim  ] youth from deprived areas expressed less concern with [LOC UK  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] foreign policy than with the chance to have their voices heard in [MISC British  ] society , while those with more education focused on disagreements with [LOC UK  ] foreign policy and the need to use the arts to address cultural tensions and reconciliation . 
Bollywood actors and executives agreed to work with the [ORG USG  ] to promote anti-extremist messages through third party actors and were excited about the idea of possibly partnering with [LOC Hollywood  ] as well . 
Community activists discussed how they are working to empower their communities and help shape the debate against extremism in [LOC UK  ] [MISC Muslim  ] communities . 
One highlight of the visit was a day trip to [LOC Leicester  ] , which [PER Pandith  ] said was arguably home to the most conservative [MISC Islamic  ] population she had seen anywhere in [LOC Europe  ] . 
End summary . 
Radicalization Efforts ------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG HMG  ] is currently working on an updated strategy , yet to be blessed by ministers , to update and improve its approach to stopping terrorists and extremists , [ORG FCO  ] Engaging the [ORG Islamic World Group Head  ] [PER Barry Lowen  ] and [ORG Arab Reform Team  ] Leader [PER Alex Cole  ] told [PER Pandith  ] and [PER Cohen  ] October 12 . 
The new strategy includes the creation of the [ORG Research and Intelligence Communications Unit  ] ( [ORG RICU  ] ) , which falls under the joint auspices of the [ORG FCO  ] , the [ORG Home Office  ] , and the [ORG Department for Communities and Local Government  ] ( [ORG DCLG  ] ) . 
Although still in the “embryonic stage , ” [PER Lowen  ] said , the [ORG RICU  ] would have three primary functions: 1 ) tracking and coordinating research and information on extremism in the [LOC UK  ] [MISC Muslim  ] Community ; 2 ) alerting [ORG HMG  ] to important events , such as an impending [PER Osama Bin Laden  ] speech , and preparing a unified government response ; and 3 ) supporting non-government tools in battling extremists ( For more on the [ORG RICU  ] and HMG’s counter-radicalization structure , see ref ) . 
One project currently underway is preparation of a paper on what language works best in public outreach , [PER Lowen  ] said ; for example , the advantage of using the word “mainstream” to define common values , as opposed to “the West , ” which can have negative connotations. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Work on empowering moderate [MISC Muslim  ] voices in the [LOC UK  ] and overseas is divided into aid directly from [ORG HMG  ] and facilitation of contacts between non-governmental actors , [PER Cole  ] said . 
Programs which [ORG HMG  ] sponsors directly include: sponsoring [MISC Arabic  ] language children’s television programming in [LOC Jordan  ] to promote peace and tolerance ; assisting visiting religious leaders and journalists from [MISC UK-based Muslim  ] communities to meet the Archbishop of [LOC Canterbury  ] and other church leaders ; and providing [MISC English  ] language training to tutors at [ORG Al-Azhar University  ] in [LOC Cairo  ] through the [ORG British Council  ] . 
On the non-governmental side , [ORG HMG  ] is also currently working to facilitate linkages between third party actors , [PER Cole  ] said . 
[PER Pandith  ] noted these efforts mirror current [ORG USG  ] initiatives . 
She and [PER Cohen  ] described [ORG USG  ] efforts at “seeding” small initiatives overseas to see what works and what doesn’t . 
Both sides agreed they would exchange ideas for promoting counter-radicalization efforts , both those directly and indirectly sponsored by governments. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) With the [ORG FCO’s Policy Planning Middle East  ] analyst [PER Richard Shaw  ] , [PER Cohen  ] described current [ORG USG  ] thinking on the linkage between public diplomacy , counter terrorism , and counter radicalization . 
[PER Shaw  ] said the [MISC UK’s  ] overall approach is focused on how likely [MISC Muslims  ] are to turn to violence . 
Unlike the [LOC U.S.  ] September 11 attack , [PER Shaw  ] noted , all of the [LOC UK  ] terrorist attacks and would-be attacks have been perpetrated by “home grown” terrorists . 
What is considered foreign policy for the [ORG USG  ] is both domestic and foreign for the [LOC UK  ] , he pointed out . 
[PER Pandith  ] , [PER Cohen  ] and [PER Shaw  ] discussed the importance of trying to work with youth through web-based technology and communications , since these are some of [LOC Al Qaida’s  ] primary tools . 
They also discussed the limitations of traditional outreach methods , including government-supported exchange programs , which pay off handsomely for those who participate but reach a mere handful of people , many of whom are already inclined to anti-extremist sentiment . 
Foreign Secretary [PER David Miliband  ] is focused on exactly these types of questions , [PER Shaw  ] said . 
The [ORG Personal Journey of the UK’s  ] , First [MISC Muslim  ] [ORG MP  ] --------------------------------------------- -------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) On October 12 , [PER Pandith  ] and [PER Cohen  ] met with newly-appointed [ORG Department for International Development  ] ( [ORG DFID  ] ) Minister [PER Shahid Malik  ] . 
A [ORG Labour MP  ] since 2005 , when he and fellow [PER Labourite Saddiq Khan  ] were the first [MISC Muslim  ] MPs ever elected to the [MISC British  ] Parliament , [PER Malik  ] is an active participant in the [MISC British Muslim  ] dialogue . 
He told [PER Pandith  ] and [PER Cohen  ] his own personal story of alienation , saying that even though he grew up in the [LOC UK  ] he was so anti-British as a young man that he rooted for the other side in any sporting match in which an [LOC England  ] team played . 
At the age of 27 , however , he was appointed to the [ORG Commission  ] for [ORG Race  ] and Equality , and began to travel around the [LOC UK  ] and listen to the stories of other [MISC Muslims  ] . 
This was a turning point in his life , he said , because he realized that many [MISC Muslims  ] were finding ways to celebrate both their [MISC Muslim  ] and their [MISC British  ] heritages simultaneously . 
In his public appearances , [PER Malik  ] said , he emphasizes that anger over [LOC UK  ] or [LOC U.S.  ] foreign policy is not a valid reason for extremism . 
By the same token , he said , it is important to separate out extremists from the vast majority of law-abiding [MISC Muslims  ] . 
He praised [PER Gordon Brown’s  ] handling of the thwarted July car bombings in [LOC London  ] , noting the Brown had referred to the perpetrators as “criminals , ” without mentioning their religion. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG HMG  ] needs to organize itself better on [MISC Muslim  ] engagement , [PER Malik  ] admitted , and work to empower young people and make sure their voices are heard . 
A lot of important work is being done on education , where the [MISC Mosques  ] and [ORG Imams Board  ] ( [ORG MINAB  ] ) has been set up to evaluate the credentials of imams to ensure that [MISC Muslim  ] youth are being taught by qualified teachers . 
[PER Pandith  ] suggested that the two governments work more closely together , wondering if [PER Malik  ] would be interested in working with other elected [MISC Muslim  ] officials around [LOC Europe  ] who were keen to engage youth , act as role models , and learn from each other . 
[PER Malik  ] was very keen to help make this happen ; [PER Pandith  ] will follow up with him. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Pandith  ] also raised the critical need for a place in [LOC Europe  ] where religiously curious youth could go to learn more about [MISC Islam  ] and specificially learn about it as a [MISC Muslim  ] in [LOC Europe  ] . 
Finding a “campus” where students could go to learn about theology as well as religion , history , culture , and science was a necessary missing piece in [LOC Europe  ] . 
[PER Malik  ] agreed and said he would follow up with further thinking about this issue . 
Female [MISC Muslim  ] Role Models ------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Pandith  ] met [PER Lady Sheikh  ] , wife of [ORG Conservative Peer Lord Sheikh  ] and herself a party activist , at her offices adjacent to [ORG Westminster Abbey  ] on October 11 . 
[PER Sheikh  ] said [MISC Muslim  ] communities are economically the most deprived in [LOC Britain  ] , and stressed the importance of educating and encouraging [MISC British Muslims  ] to participate in democracy . 
She expressed an interest in receiving [MISC American  ] female [MISC Muslim  ] visitors whom she could introduce to young [MISC Muslim  ] women to serve as role models . 
[PER Pandith  ] said the [ORG USG  ] engages in outreach of this kind and told [PER Sheikh  ] the Embassy would keep her request in mind when programming such exchanges . 
Visit to [LOC Leicester  ] ------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On October 11 , [PER Pandith  ] and [PER Cohen  ] traveled to [LOC Leicester  ] , a large urban center about 70 minutes north of [LOC London  ] with a substantial ethic minority population . 
[MISC Leicester’s Muslim  ] population is 11 percent , well above the overall [LOC UK  ] percentage of three percent . 
The visit was organized by [PER Parvin Ali  ] , founder and Chief of Executive of [ORG FATIMA Women’s Network  ] , which aims to address [MISC Muslim  ] women’s issues both locally and nationally . 
[PER Pandith  ] and [PER Cohen  ] toured a number of [MISC Leicester’s  ] commingled but distinct ethnic neighborhoods , including Highfields ( lower income , predominantly ethnic [MISC Indian  ] [ORG Gujarati  ] , influenced religiously by the [MISC Wahhabi  ] sect ) , [ORG Medway  ] ( [MISC Bangladeshi  ] ) , [LOC Evington  ] ( mainly [MISC Muslim  ] , middle class ) , Stonygate ( progressive [MISC Jewish  ] neighborhood with recent influx of more affluent [MISC Muslims  ] ) , and [LOC Oadby  ] ( more prosperous and outside the city center ) . 
With over 200 mosques and madrasses in [LOC Leicester  ] , [PER Ali  ] noted , the city has for the first time put up Eid decorations on the streets in [MISC Muslim  ] neighborhoods . 
[MISC Diwali  ] decorations have been a tradition for some time , [PER Ali  ] said , and the [MISC Diwali  ] celebrations in [LOC Leicester  ] are said to be the largest in [LOC Europe  ] , and possibly the largest outside of [LOC India.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Leicester’s  ] progressive [MISC Muslims  ] may be politically “quieter” because of the comparatively huge orthodox presence , [PER Ali  ] said . 
The large numbers of [ORG Gujarati  ] immigrants who came to the [LOC UK  ] had originally settled in [LOC East Africa  ] , and so brought with them a unique cultural memory of immigration strategies that had worked there . 
These immigrants knew and recognized the importance of immediately building up community institutions , leading to the proliferation of mosques and other community institutions . 
In addition , [MISC Leicester’s  ] ethnic climate is unique academically - the University of [LOC Leicester  ] attracts numerous students from outside the area , even internationally , due to its academic prestige . 
[ORG DeMontFord University  ] , by contrast , can then absorb more local populations , leading to a high level of ethnic diversity there. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Members of the [ORG Leicestershire Constabulary’s Community Safety Bureau  ] described to [PER Pandith  ] and [PER Cohen  ] how their main focus is neighborhood policing and anti-terrorism , including racially and religiously-related crime . 
These programs rely on non-police community actors , who advise , inform , and assist with police operations . 
The police force will inform key community members prior to a raid , so that once police action is taken , comprehensive information on the situation is made available immediately to the community , thus preventing rumors and a possible escalation of conflict . 
As a result , there has been a significant level of community engagement with law enforcement . 
Constabulary officials acknowledged that their success might be a useful information tool for others in the [LOC United States  ] or [LOC UK  ] . 
[PER Pandith  ] expressed interest in passing information on their work to the [ORG Department of Homeland Security.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Despite the many positive programs in [LOC Leicester  ] , the isolation of some parts of the [MISC Muslim  ] community was striking . 
During a discussion with religious and community leaders at an [LOC Ahmadiyya  ] mosque , [PER Yaqub Khan  ] , General Secretary of a local organization called the [ORG Pakistan Association  ] , insisted that he had to teach young people in [LOC Urdu  ] . 
When [PER Pandith  ] challenged him as to why he would use [LOC Urdu  ] with children who were growing up with [MISC English  ] as their first language , [PER Khan  ] insisted that there were no good books on the [MISC Koran  ] in [MISC English  ] . 
At a local book store , texts in [MISC English  ] seemed designed to segregate [MISC Muslims  ] from their wider community , urging women to cover themselves and remain in their homes , playing up the differences between [MISC Islam  ] and other religions , seeking to isolate [MISC Muslims  ] from community , and feeding hate of [MISC Jews  ] to the young . 
Some [LOC Leicester  ] [MISC Muslims  ] seemed to have haphazardly thrown together different elements of [MISC Islam  ] , pairing an [MISC Arabian Gulf-style  ] hijab with a [MISC Pakistani  ] shalwar kameez , for example . 
Girls as young as four years old were completely covered . 
[PER Pandith  ] commented afterward that this was the most conservative [MISC Islamic  ] community she had seen anywhere in [LOC Europe  ] . 
[ORG Muslim Youth  ] ------------ <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Pandith  ] and [PER Cohen  ] attended three events specifically aimed at hearing the concerns of [MISC Muslim  ] youth in [LOC London  ] . 
On October 9 they traveled to the [LOC East London  ] neighborhood of [LOC Waltham Forest  ] , a largely [MISC Muslim  ] area that is plagued by urban problems including drugs , youth gangs , violence ( three young people were shot close to the meeting site that same evening ) , and a significant radical [MISC Muslim  ] presence . 
There they met with young [MISC Muslims  ] , journalists , and community leaders , including the Mayor of [LOC Waltham Forest  ] and two [ORG Borough Councillors  ] , under the auspices of the [ORG Active Change Foundation  ] ( [ORG ACF  ] ) , a recently-launched leadership training program targeted at [MISC Muslim  ] youth in deprived areas of [LOC East London  ] . 
The [ORG ACF  ] had just finished recruiting its first class of young men and women to participate in the [MISC ACF’s  ] inaugural leadership training course . 
During the meeting , the young people present repeated several times to [PER Pandith  ] and [PER Cohen  ] that they want the skills and the opportunities to be able to represent their views to the media and to decision makers . 
Although the journalists kept interjecting foreign policy issues such as [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Israel/Palestine  ] , the young people stressed that while those issues might be of some concern , the real issues in their lives are jobs , education , and empowerment . 
After a lively exchange , the [ORG ACF  ] students presented a grant application for Embassy consideration , and both sides pledged that the link forged that evening would be maintained. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In contrast , [PER Cohen  ] met October 9 with a small group of more privileged [MISC Muslim  ] youth in [LOC Kensington  ] , a wealthy [LOC London  ] district . 
This meeting was held under the auspices of [LOC Kensington  ] Borough Councillor [PER Mushtaq Lasharie  ] , himself a [MISC British Muslim  ] of [MISC Pakistani  ] origin who is the first [MISC Muslim  ] councillor for this predominantly non-Muslim area . 
The young people at this meeting , all with higher education , said they wanted to see reconciliation themes conveyed through the arts , especially music . 
[PER Cohen  ] urged them to turn their ideas into action. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( U ) An Iftar sponsored by the [ORG Next Century Foundation  ] and held in [PER Pandith  ] and Cohen’s honor October 10 drew such a large number of participants that the group was split in two . 
Participants included representatives of the [ORG Muslim Public Affairs Committee UK  ] ( [ORG MPAC  ] ) , and the [ORG Leeds  ] and [PER Bradford Diasporas  ] , the [LOC UK  ] [MISC Turkish  ] community , and [MISC Muslim  ] community leaders . 
Discussion centered on foreign policy issues including [LOC Kashmir  ] , [LOC Israel/Palestine  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , Armenia/Turkey , and the spread of fundamentalist [MISC Islam  ] . 
The wide variety of opinions expressed provided [LOC U.S.  ] participants with a broad cross-section of the positions of the different [MISC Muslim  ] communities in [LOC Britain  ] . 
[PER Cohen  ] noted a distinct difference between the focus of these young people -- all in their mid-20s with graduate degrees -- as opposed to the group of more impoverished youth in [LOC East London  ] , where discussions focused on integration and opportunity issues inside of [LOC Britain  ] . 
This group focused entirely on foreign policy , and more specifically on [LOC U.S.  ] foreign policy . 
Many of them had radical views , including that “America had 9/11 coming to it.” [MISC Bollywood  ] --------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On October 10 , [PER Pandith  ] and [PER Cohen  ] met with a cross section of the [MISC South Asian  ] community working in film to discuss the potential of working with the [MISC Indian  ] film industry - “Bollywood” - on delivering an anti-terrorism message . 
Participants included Director of Arts Versa [PER Mohsin Abbas  ] , [ORG Channel  ] 4 [ORG TV Head of Multicultural Programming  ] [PER Farouk Dhondi  ] , Producer Director [PER Mahmood Jamal  ] , Locations Manager [PER Amjad Khan  ] , and singer/actress [PER Humeira Akhter  ] , who has strong links with top [MISC Bollywood  ] actors/actresses . 
A lively discussion produced a number of possible ideas , including developing ways to promote existing anti-terrorist films , and to develop funds for similar productions . 
Once such an anti-extremist genre is established , participants believed that major [MISC Bollywood  ] figures would be willing to speak out on the issue . 
[PER Humaira Akhtar  ] has already gotten back to [PER Pandith  ] on possible stars in [MISC Bollywood  ] interested in such a project . 
Community Groups ---------------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( U ) The [ORG National Muslim Communities Development Network  ] ( [ORG MCDM  ] ) arose from a series of meetings held by various [LOC UK  ] [MISC Muslim  ] communities , following the July 5 , 2007 bombings in [LOC London  ] . 
[ORG MCDM  ] is now an independent structure intended to bring attention to the continuing work of existing organizations focused on countering extremism . 
It works to help develop and broaden emerging leadership within [MISC Muslim  ] communities , bringing communities together through positive action and raising the standard of debate on [MISC Islam  ] in [LOC Britain  ] today . 
In a meeting October 10 , [ORG MCDM  ] members including Director [PER Nadeem Kazmi  ] , [ORG Muslim Media Network’s  ] [PER Munir Zamir  ] , [LOC Waltham Forest  ] Community [ORG Cohesion Office  ] [PER Munir Zamir  ] , [ORG Citibank’s Nazish Zaid  ] , [ORG Khayall Theater’s  ] [PER Luqman Ali  ] , Jang’s [PER Ali Murtaza Shah  ] , and Art Versa [PER Mohsin Abbas  ] , exchanged views with [PER Pandith  ] and [PER Cohen  ] about the challenge of promoting a more sophisticated and nuanced approach to the debate on [MISC Islam  ] in [MISC British  ] society . 
All parties committed to continue to explore ways to support [ORG MCDM  ] programs , while the [ORG MCDM  ] leaders agreed to facilitate [LOC U.S.  ] mission efforts to reach out to the [MISC British Muslim  ] community . 
These leaders agreed to stay in touch with [PER Cohen  ] and [PER Pandith  ] about their progress in creating a network of activists . 
Media ----- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Taking advantage of the wide range of [LOC Diaspora  ] media available in [LOC London  ] , [PER Pandith  ] spoke to a cross section of the [MISC UK-based Muslim  ] media during her visit , including [ORG Jang Daily News  ] , the oldest [MISC Pakistani-community  ] newspaper in the [LOC UK  ] with a [MISC European  ] circulation of about 23,000 readers ; [PER Emel Magazine  ] , a high-end weekly glossy with a print run of 20,000: the [ORG Muslim Weekly  ] , whose website receives 34,000 hits a day ; and [PER Al Hayat  ] , an influential [ORG Pan Arab  ] daily with a world-wide circulation of 160,000 . 
[PER Pandith  ] stressed that the USG is interested in building a dialogue with [MISC European Muslims  ] from which both sides benefit: this gives the [LOC United States  ] a chance to dispel myths that its policies are anti-Islam , and [MISC Muslims  ] gain a better understanding of how [LOC U.S.  ] foreign policy is shaped . 
It also empowers [MISC Muslims  ] to discuss their own religion directly , rather than allowing the media to interpret for them through soundbites and other filters . 
As this dialogue has improved , so has understanding , leading to cooperative efforts to develop and support grass roots movements that combat the destructive impulses of extremists . 
Drawing on her own experience as a [MISC Muslim American  ] , [PER Pandith  ] sought to dispel some myths about [MISC Muslims  ] in [LOC America  ] , noting that they are free to honor their religion as well as their ethnic and cultural backgrounds . 
The tension between allegiance to one’s country and to one’s faith is mostly absent for [MISC American  ] [MISC Muslims  ] , she said , because [LOC America  ] is a country of immigrants , many of whom emigrated seeking religious freedom . 
She was careful to point out that the history of immigration and integration in the [LOC United States  ] has at times been painful , but stressed that as a country the [LOC United States  ] has benefited greatly from the experiences of the [ORG Civil Rights Movement.  ] <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 .
