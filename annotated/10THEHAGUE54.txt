( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC SUMMARY:  ] The [LOC Netherlands  ] will join the [ORG EU  ] in inscribing a conditional emissions reduction target of 30 percent if others commit to comparable efforts . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] had pushed to make the 30 percent offer unconditionally . 
[MISC Dutch  ] climate officials are recalibrating their negotiating strategy after COP15 and putting greater emphasis on pragmatism . 
They have praised several facets of the [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] and are eager to make it operational . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] are concerned that failure by donors to get fast-track financing flowing quickly will lead to more friction with developing countries later this year . 
END SUMMARY. --------------------------------------------- --------- AMBASSADOR DISCUSSES CLIMATE WITH ENVIRONMENT MINISTER --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Ambassador delivered reftel points January 13 during her initial call on Environment Minister [PER Jacqueline Cramer  ] . 
[PER Cramer  ] said the [ORG EU  ] should inscribe its target as a single entity . 
She also emphasized the need for developed country pledges , taken as a whole , to add up to a convincing number for the developing world . 
She expressed concern that the January 31 annex would be insufficient because this bottom-up approach will not get to a 25 percent developed country commitment . 
She advocated a specific negotiating track led by the [LOC U.S.  ] and others to determine how the developed world can come up with a convincing target . 
[PER Cramer  ] acknowledged this is a delicate process and offered [MISC Dutch  ] help . 
Regarding the [MISC Dutch  ] national goal , [PER Cramer  ] reiterated the [MISC Dutch  ] government’s long-standing target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 30 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 . 
( [PER Note: Most  ] domestic environmental and energy analysts consider this unachievable . 
End note . 
) Given this ambitious domestic goal , [PER Cramer  ] cautioned that [MISC Dutch  ] government and industry were looking for comparable efforts and a level playing field with other [ORG EU  ] member states and major global emitters. --------------------------------------------- ------------ [LOC NETHERLANDS  ] JOINS [LOC UK  ] IN PUSH FOR 30 PERCENT [ORG EU  ] COMMITMENT --------------------------------------------- ------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) EmbOffs reinforced reftel points January 25 with the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] climate negotiator [PER Sanne Kaasjager  ] . 
He said the [LOC Netherlands  ] would join the [ORG EU  ] in inscribing a conditional , collective target of 30 percent ( the so-called “20/30” commitment , either/or ) . 
He described a “vicious” January 20 COREPER meeting where the [MISC UK’s  ] and the [MISC Netherlands’  ] push for an unconditional 30 percent target ( or at least “20-30” percent , leaving the option for a figure in between ) met stiff resistance from [LOC Italy  ] and [LOC Poland  ] . 
The [LOC Netherlands  ] will not inscribe its own national target -- 30 percent by 2020 -- for fear of distracting attention from the [ORG EU  ] target and because its national commitment is a political rather than legal one. -------------------------------- ENTHUSIASM FOR [LOC COPENHAGEN  ] [MISC ACCORD  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Kaasjager  ] said the [LOC Netherlands  ] considered the [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] a significant accomplishment . 
Specifically , he called the [MISC Accord  ] a “breakthrough” for setting out political consensus around the 6 to 8 most contentious issues in climate negotiations . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] were pleased the [MISC Accord  ] reiterated the 2 degree Celsius objective . 
[PER Kaasjager  ] praised President Obama’s hands-on role in securing the [MISC Accord  ] while sharply criticizing the “inept” Qsecuring the [MISC Accord  ] while sharply criticizing the “inept” [MISC Danish  ] performance as chair of [LOC COP15.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Dutch  ] government is taking steps to convince developing countries to “associate with” the [MISC Accord  ] . 
[PER Kaasjager  ] has drafted messages for embassies in capitals receiving [MISC Dutch  ] development assistance to solicit support . 
This is an unprecedented move for the [MISC Dutch  ] government , which traditionally recoils at any suggestion to use aid money as political leverage . 
But at the annual [MISC Dutch  ] chiefs of mission conference in mid-January , ambassadors were clamoring for guidance on how to engage and persuade developing countries on climate negotiations . 
However , [PER Kaasjager  ] said the [LOC Netherlands  ] would find it difficult to make association with the [MISC Accord  ] a condition to receive climate financing. ---------------------------- [ORG EU  ] INTROSPECTION AFTER COP15 ---------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) According to [PER Kaasjager  ] , the [LOC Copenhagen  ] endgame has THE HAGUE 00000054 002 OF 002 caused the [ORG EU  ] to take a hard look at its role in climate talks . 
He was taken aback by the sight of [MISC European  ] leaders ( e.g. , PM Brown and [LOC Chancellor Merkel  ] ) hovering around the VIP room sofas where the [MISC Chinese  ] , [MISC Indian  ] , [MISC South African  ] , and [MISC Brazilian  ] representatives were consulting , trying in vain to get pull asides with the [ORG BASIC  ] leaders . 
[PER Kaasjager  ] took exception with the media’s portrayal of the [MISC EU’s  ] exclusion from the final stages of the [LOC Copenhagen  ] talks , but delivered a harsh verdict on the [MISC EU’s  ] performance at COP15 . 
He lamented the lack of [ORG Member State  ] discipline and the failure to bring a “tactical plan” -- meaning the [ORG EU  ] was unprepared to adjust quickly to changing dynamics as the talks unfolded . 
He said his [ORG EU  ] counterparts are coming around to the notion that [MISC Europe’s  ] strategy must shift from “How to involve the [LOC U.S.  ] ? ” to “How to involve [LOC China  ] ? ” ------------------------------ PATH FORWARD FOR CLIMATE TALKS ------------------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In a word , [PER Kaasjager  ] said what emerged from [LOC Copenhagen  ] was “pragmatism.” More than ever , [MISC Dutch  ] climate officials appreciate that climate negotiations will be an incremental “process of small steps.” They are still deliberating on what the right long-term negotiating track is going forward: bilateral cooperation between major emitters ; coalitions of the willing ( such as the [ORG Major Economies Forum  ] , G20 , or [ORG Greenland Dialogue  ] ) ; or the legalistic [ORG UN  ] process . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] think a bottom-up bilateral approach will not achieve enough emissions reductions . 
They worry about exclusion from [LOC MEF  ] and G20 fora . 
And they are currently disenchanted with the top-down [ORG UN  ] process vulnerable to spoiler countries . 
[PER Kaasjager  ] said the [LOC Netherlands  ] will work to forge a middle road that is achievable and inclusive . 
In the near-term the [MISC Dutch  ] are eager to use the next several months to make the [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] operational and bring its elements to the formal negotiating table in [LOC Bonn  ] in [LOC June.  ] ---------------------------- FAST-TRACK FINANCING PIVOTAL ---------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Kaasjager  ] was particularly concerned about bottlenecks in the flow of fast-track financing envisioned in the [LOC Copenhagen  ] [MISC Accord  ] . 
Without serious effort by donor countries , he predicted a worst case scenario in which G77 members use the late 2010 Cancun meeting to accuse the developed world of failing to follow through on its fast-track financing promises . 
He identified three potential areas of friction with developing countries on financing: most of the pledged funding is not “additional” ; it is skewed towards mitigation programs rather than adaptation ; and much of it is already committed without much say from recipients . 
[PER Kaasjager  ] has circulated a proposal for donor country counterparts to meet informally at working levels with recipients countries to address these issues head-on rather than wait for them to surface as a [LOC PR  ] disaster later .
