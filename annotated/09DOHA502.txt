( C ) During their July 20-21 visit to [LOC Qatar  ] , Assistant Secretary of Defense ( ASD ) for [ORG International Security Affairs  ] , Ambassador [PER Alexander Vershbow  ] , and State Political-Military ( PM ) Assistant Secretary [PER Andrew Shapiro  ] held meetings with [LOC Qatar  ] 's military Chief of [LOC Staff  ] , Major General ( [ORG MG  ] ) [ORG Hamad  ] al-Attiyah and the [MISC Crown  ] [PER Prince Tamim  ] bin [ORG Hamad  ] al [PER Thani  ] . 
[ORG MG  ] al-Attiyah and the [MISC Crown  ] [PER Prince  ] tried to assure the Assistant Secretaries that [LOC Qatar  ] used the Chief of [LOC Staff  ] 's visit to press [LOC Iran  ] to respond to [LOC U.S.  ] offers of engagement and to dismiss as " rubbish " [MISC Iranian  ] efforts to blame the election crisis on [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC UK  ] special services . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] affirmed displeasure with [MISC Iranian  ] behavior , and said the [LOC U.S.  ] would not tolerate [MISC Iranian  ] pursuit of nuclear weapons . 
ASD [PER Vershbow  ] suggested now was the time for [LOC Qatar  ] to distance itself from [LOC Iran  ] and its proxies and urge [LOC Iran  ] to end its destabilizing behavior. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG MG  ] al Attiyah and the [MISC Crown  ] [PER Prince  ] repeated the [MISC Qatari  ] position that they felt the need to engage all their neighbors and that [LOC Qatar  ] could perhaps influence [MISC Iranian  ] behavior through its engagement . 
[ORG MG  ] al-Attiyah also expressed disappointment that the [ORG Large Aircraft Infrared Counter Measure  ] ( [ORG LAIRCM  ] ) system is not available to be installed on [LOC Qatar  ] 's recently purchased [MISC C-17  ] aircraft . 
ASD [PER Vershbow  ] said he would look into the issue further and that a formal response from the [ORG SecDef  ] would be forthcoming . 
The Chief of [LOC Staff  ] also said no decision had been made on fulfilling an earlier [LOC U.S.  ] request to provide funding for the refurbishment of [MISC Jordanian  ] tanks being provided to [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
When ASD [PER Vershbow  ] requested that [LOC Qatar  ] use its good offices to help the [LOC U.S.  ] in [LOC Yemen  ] and induce a change in [ORG Hamas  ] 's behavior , the Chief of [LOC Staff  ] expressed irritation that [MISC U.S.-Qatar  ] friendship did not extend to issues of importance to [LOC Qatar  ] , such as [ORG LAIRCM  ] . 
END SUMMARY [MISC U.S.-QATAR  ] RELATIONSHIP ----------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [LOC U.S.  ] Assistant Secretary of Defense ( [ORG ASD  ] ) for [ORG International Affairs Vershbow and Assistant  ] Secretary of State for [ORG Political-Military Affairs Shapiro  ] , joined by Ambassador , met July 20-21 over dinner and in a separate office call with Chief of [LOC Staff  ] ( [ORG COS  ] ) Major General [ORG Hamad  ] al-Attiyah . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] visitors thanked the [ORG COS  ] for [LOC Qatar  ] 's continued hospitality and support and for hosting our presence at both [MISC Camp As  ] Sayliyah ( CAS ) and Al-Udeid Air Base ( [ORG AUAB  ] ) . 
[MISC C-17  ] PURCHASE ------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) BG General al-Malki ( Commander of the [ORG Fighter Wing  ] and Chairman of the [ORG Transport Committee  ] ) informed [ORG ASD  ] [PER Vershbow  ] that the first [MISC C-17  ] was on schedule for delivery and would depart [LOC California  ] on August 11 with an [ORG ETA  ] at [ORG AUAB  ] O/A August <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
In addition , BG General al-Malki mentioned his disappointment at the delay of the pilot training program , which will further delay the aircraft from becoming operational . 
In response , [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] reassured him that [ORG USG  ] would work to resolve the issue. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG COS  ] al-Attiyah expressed his concern to [ORG ASD  ] regarding the [MISC C-17  ] [ORG LAIRCM  ] . 
The [ORG COS  ] stated that he was greatly disappointed over [ORG USG  ] disapproval of [LOC Qatar  ] 's application for [ORG LAIRCM  ] . 
Al-Malki pointed out that other nations had acquired the system and that [LOC Qatar  ] 's exclusion added to his frustration . 
The [ORG COS  ] said he did not want to elevate the matter to [LOC Qatar  ] 's civilian leadership . 
He believed that [LOC Qatar  ] 's leaders would question the benefits of the [MISC U.S.-Qatari  ] military relationship if the concern were to be raised. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG ASD  ] [PER Vershbow  ] responded that a letter would be forthcoming from [ORG SECDEF  ] explaining that [LOC Qatar  ] would be receiving the same aircraft as received by the [LOC United States  ] Air Force ( [ORG USAF  ] ) . 
[PER Vershbow  ] further clarified that the [ORG LAIRCM  ] was an additional add-on , for which transfer to [LOC Qatar  ] had been disapproved . 
[PER Vershbow  ] recommended that [LOC Qatar  ] pursue other options , noting he was unaware that other nations had access to the [ORG LAIRCM  ] system for transport aircraft . 
[ORG ASD Vershbow  ] said he would look into the matter , adjust the [ORG SECDEF  ] letter as necessary and respond formally to the [ORG GOQ  ] . 
[ORG COS  ] and al-Malki stressed [LOC Qatar  ] 's desire to use aircraft jointly with the [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG Coalition Forces  ] . 
[LOC IRAN  ] ---- [ORG DOHA  ] 00000502 002 OF 003 <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG ASD  ] asked the [ORG COS  ] to recount his visit to the [LOC Islamic Republic of Iran  ] . 
[ORG COS  ] briefed that his first visit to [LOC Iran  ] was short in duration . 
The [MISC Qatari  ] delegation praised President [PER Obama  ] 's [ORG Cairo Speech  ] while in [LOC Iran  ] and urged the [MISC Iranians  ] to take steps to avoid isolating themselves internationally . 
Further , the [MISC Qataris  ] suggested that the [MISC Iranians  ] seek engagement and rapprochement . 
[ORG ASD Vershbow  ] said this was the right message , and those who have contacts with [LOC Iran  ] should use every opportunity to persuade [MISC Iranian  ] leaders to end their destabilizing behavior. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG ASD  ] [PER Vershbow  ] reiterated the need for [LOC Iran  ] to take steps to convince the international community that it was not pursuing a nuclear weapons capability , and to end its support for [ORG Hamas  ] , [ORG Hizballah  ] , and other extremist groups . 
He said we understand why [LOC Qatar  ] , because of its close proximity and its economic and political ties to [LOC Iran  ] , felt the need to engage with [LOC Iran  ] . 
[LOC Qatar  ] should help the [MISC Iranians  ] to avoid a conflict with the [LOC U.S.  ] and the international community , remarking that " friends do not let friends drive drunk . 
" <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [ORG COS  ] al-Attiyah responded that while [LOC Iran  ] expresses a desire privately to change its behavior , these could be meaningless platitudes . 
The [ORG COS  ] reiterated that the [ORG GOQ  ] opposes any [MISC Iranian  ] pursuit of a military nuclear capability , noting that it would destabilize the region . 
[ORG COS  ] further suggested that the [ORG USG  ] continue its own dialogue with the [LOC Islamic Republic  ] . 
[ORG COS  ] al-Attiyah closed the discussion by making clear that , with respect to [LOC Iran  ] , " while we're neighbors , we're not friends . 
" He summed up his recent visit to [LOC Tehran  ] as an overture to maintain open channels of communication with [LOC Iran  ] . 
[LOC LEBANON  ] ------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [ORG ASD  ] asked if the [ORG GOQ  ] had a response to an earlier request to the Prime Minister by Secretary Gates to help fund the transfer of 55 M1A1 tanks from [LOC Jordan  ] to [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
[ORG COS  ] said he was aware of the request , but that no decision had been made . 
He added that he had discussed the issue during a recent CHOD conference with [MISC Jordanian  ] and [MISC Lebanese  ] representatives . 
[ORG HAMAS  ] ----- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [ORG ASD  ] Vershbow raised [LOC Qatar  ] 's ties with [ORG Hamas  ] , and told the [ORG COS  ] that [ORG Hamas  ] needs to be encouraged to rejoin the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] and the [ORG Peace Process  ] . 
He added that there should be " no blank checks , no checks at all , " for [ORG Hamas  ] . 
[ORG ASD  ] suggested that [LOC Qatar  ] was in a position to influence [ORG Hamas  ] ; if [LOC Qatar  ] helped bring about a change in [ORG Hamas  ] 's behavior , it could enhance the [MISC U.S.-Qatar  ] strategic relationship . 
[ORG COS  ] undertook to relay that message to the [ORG Amir  ] and Crown Prince . 
While the [ORG COS  ] underscored that [LOC Qatar  ] wants a good relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] , he noted there were times when [ORG USG  ] decisions sent a different signal , such as the [ORG USG  ] 's decision on [ORG LAIRCM  ] . 
[ORG COS  ] al-Attiyah rhetorically asked , " Are we friends or not ? 
" [LOC YEMEN  ] ----- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [ORG ASD  ] Vershbow asked if [LOC Qatar  ] , or the [ORG GCC  ] as a whole , would be renewing efforts to help solve the troubles in [LOC Yemen  ] , citing [LOC Qatar  ] 's previous mediation efforts . 
[ORG COS  ] al-Attiyah responded that [ORG GOQ  ] had engaged [LOC Yemen  ] in the past , but noted that maintaining productive dialogue is difficult , given [LOC Yemen  ] 's economic plight and decentralized tribal society . 
The [ORG COS  ] added that the [ORG GOQ  ] was unsure how [MISC Yemeni  ] President [PER Saleh  ] plans to curtail the violence there . 
He also noted that there is little military cooperation between the [ORG Qatar Armed Forces  ] ( [ORG QAF  ] ) and [LOC Yemen  ] , but that he would make the [ORG GOQ  ] leadership aware of the [ORG ASD  ] 's interest . 
The [ORG COS  ] said that the [ORG GCC  ] had earlier presented a " unified package , " but its efforts in [LOC Yemen  ] had failed . 
[ORG COS  ] al-Attiyah recommended that this subject be addressed at the [ORG Manama Dialogue  ] in December . 
NSS and CIP ----------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [ORG ASD  ] commended the [ORG COS  ] on the upcoming [ORG CENTCOM-GOQ-Naval War College  ] effort to develop a [ORG National Security Strategy  ] . 
[LOC Qatar  ] and others in the region need to place more emphasis on [ORG Critical Infrastructure Protection  ] , added the [ORG ASD  ] . 
[ORG COS  ] al-Attiyah agreed and said he was looking forward to this effort . 
( [LOC Note:  ] OMC [LOC Qatar  ] will escort an interagency [MISC Qatari  ] delegation back to [LOC Tampa August  ] 11-13 to [ORG DOHA  ] 00000502 003 OF 003 begin this process . 
) CLOSING REMARKS --------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [ORG COS  ] ended the discussions by stating that he valued the [MISC U.S.-Qatar  ] relationship . 
The [ORG GOQ  ] was committed to the friendship forged between the two nations , he said . 
[ORG COS  ] said he is looking forward to the [MISC P4  ] visit and expressed his desire to invite the [MISC P4  ] to his beach house as schedules permit . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [LOC Qatar  ] clearly registered its disappointment in not receiving [ORG LAIRCM  ] for its C-17 . 
We believe this could fester into an open wound in the vital [MISC U.S.-Qatar  ] security relationship . 
The Chief of Staff is particularly sensitive about the issue , since [LOC Qatar  ] 's senior leadership ( the [ORG Amir  ] and Crown Prince ) holds him responsible for maintaining a close and productive [MISC U.S.-Qatar  ] military relationship . 
However , given the [MISC Qatari  ] leadership 's perception of the Chief of Staff 's inability so far to get [ORG LAIRCM  ] , senior leadership may start to question the Chief of Staff 's assurances about the strength of the [MISC U.S.-Qatar  ] military relationship . 
End Comment. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( U ) This cable was cleared by Assistant Secretary of Defense [PER Alexander Vershbow  ] .
