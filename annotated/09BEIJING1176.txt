( [ORG S  ] ) Summary Continued: [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] raised concerns over [MISC China’s  ] “core interests” of [LOC Tibet  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] arms sales to [LOC Taiwan  ] , which he said could “derail” bilateral cooperation .

The [ORG Charge  ] and [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] agreed on the importance of high-level meetings to the bilateral relationship and reviewed a number of recent and upcoming visits . 
End Summary . 
[LOC TAIWAN  ] OBSERVERSHIP AT [LOC WHA  ] -------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The agreement allowing [LOC Taiwan  ] to participate as an observer at the [ORG World Health Assembly  ] ( [ORG WHA  ] ) meetings in [LOC Geneva  ] in May was “one step forward” toward better cross-Strait relations and demonstrated what could be achieved through consultations based on “one [LOC China  ] , very broadly interpreted , ” [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said at a [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] working lunch hosted by the [ORG Charge  ] d’Affaires . 
Cross-Strait relations were “improving , ” and as they did , [LOC China  ] hoped the [LOC United States  ] would feel “less burdened , frustrated and nervous , ” [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said . 
The [ORG Charge  ] congratulated [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] on the agreement , noting its timeliness in light of concerns over the [MISC H1N1  ] outbreak , while expressing hope that both sides would continue to take steps to increase mutual trust . 
IMPORTANCE OF BILATERAL VISITS ------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [ORG Charge  ] and [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] agreed on the importance of high-level meetings to the bilateral relationship and reviewed a number of recent and upcoming visits . 
Both concurred that Chief of [ORG Naval Operations ADM Roughead’s  ] visit to [LOC China  ] was a success . 
The [ORG Charge  ] emphasized that , as President [PER Obama  ] told Foreign Minister [PER Yang  ] , the [LOC United States  ] wanted to move relations between our two militaries forward . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] agreed that State Councilor [PER Liu Yandong’s  ] visit , including her meeting with Secretary [PER Clinton  ] , had been productive . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [PER Liu  ] came away “very impressed” by her interaction with Secretary [PER Clinton  ] and wanted very much to “follow up” on the issues they discussed such as education , something very basic and important to the people of both countries. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Although we recognize the importance of the proposed visit by [ORG Politburo Member  ] and [ORG CCP Organization Department BEIJING  ] 00001176 002 OF 005 Head [PER Li Yuanchao  ] , it would be easier to arrange a successful visit if [PER Li  ] could postpone his travel to a less busy time , the [ORG Charge  ] said . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] replied that the visit of [PER Li  ] , a “future leader of [LOC China  ] , ” was “very important , ” so [LOC China  ] hoped the [LOC United States  ] would provide a full schedule of meetings with senior leaders despite the fact that those leaders recently met with State Councilor [PER Liu  ] . 
The [ORG Charge  ] urged [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] to arrange a useful schedule for Speaker of the [ORG House  ] [PER Nancy Pelosi  ] , including a trip to [LOC Tibet  ] or [MISC Tibetan  ] areas , noting that the Speaker was also particularly interested in climate change and environmental issues . 
[LOC China  ] would treat Speaker Pelosi’s visit as a type of “state visit , ” [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] replied . 
Nevertheless , given her “tight schedule , ” the Speaker would likely “not have time” to visit [LOC Tibet  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Reviewing the upcoming meetings between Presidents [PER Obama  ] and Hu this year , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that , over the past 30 years , the [MISC U.S.-China  ] relationship had been driven by high-level visits to a greater degree than other bilateral relationships . 
With these meetings between our two presidents in mind , both sides should be “careful” and act in ways that benefit the long-term interests of the bilateral relationship . 
Our two presidents would meet several times in the coming months , including at the [MISC G-8  ] , [MISC G-20  ] and [ORG APEC  ] summits , after which [LOC China  ] anticipated President [PER Obama  ] would visit [LOC China  ] . 
We should plan our work for the bilateral relationship in the year ahead with the President’s visit to [LOC China  ] in mind . 
G-20: DATES AND TOPICS ----------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated that , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] he would ask to meet with NSC’s [PER Michael Froman  ] in [LOC Washington  ] and was considering requesting an appropriate meeting with the [ORG Treasury Department  ] . 
The topics would include the dates of the next [MISC G-20  ] meeting , as well as the agenda. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) In the first two [ORG G-20 Financial Summits  ] , [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Chinese  ] positions had been close , closer even than the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Europe  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted . 
Views on major issues such as the need for fiscal stimulus and reform of international financial institutions were similar . 
Leading up to the [LOC London Summit  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] felt that the [LOC U.S.-U.K.-China  ] “troika” had been effective: [LOC Beijing  ] could persuade the developing countries , [LOC Washington  ] could influence [LOC Japan  ] and [LOC South Korea  ] , and [LOC London  ] could bring along the [MISC Europeans.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The first two [MISC G-20  ] summits , according to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] had succeeded in boosting confidence and agreeing on measures to help international financial institutions cope with the crisis . 
Now , the [MISC G-20  ] had entered an implementation period . 
He outlined four objectives that he intended to discuss with [PER Froman:  ] A ) [MISC Establish  ] what stimulus and macroeconomic policy coordination the [MISC G-20  ] economies needed to implement to ensure economic recovery ; B ) Strengthen the message against protectionism so that leaders did not “break their promises as soon as they returned home” ; C ) Set a clear timetable for [ORG IMF  ] reform , establishing whether the [ORG New Arrangement  ] to [PER Borrow  ] ( [ORG NAB  ] ) decisions had any relation to future quota ; and D ) Reforming the international monetary system , vis-a-vis the dollar and an alternative reserve currency such as Special Drawing Rights ( SDRs ) . <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Expounding on this last topic , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated that a stable [LOC U.S.  ] dollar was good for [LOC China  ] , and [LOC Beijing  ] had no interest in “destabilizing the system.” The system , however , was “not perfect and needs reform.” He said [LOC China  ] had a huge stake in how the [LOC United States  ] managed the dollar . 
Further , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] suggested that the [ORG RMB  ] could become a component of the [ORG SDR  ] . 
Mentioning that the [ORG RMB  ] could compose two percent of the [ORG SDR  ] value , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that this was more of a symbolic than practical change. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) Note: XXXXXXXXXXXX’s comments on the [MISC Strategic  ] and [ORG Economic Dialogue  ] will be reported septel . 
VFM HE’S [LOC WASHINGTON  ] VISIT: [LOC DPRK  ] , [LOC IRAN  ] , [LOC AF/PAK  ] --------------------------------------------- [LOC BEIJING  ] 00001176 003 OF 005 <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] reviewed several issues he hoped to discuss during his upcoming visit to [LOC Washington  ] , including [LOC North Korea  ] , [LOC Iran  ] and [ORG Afghanistan/Pakistan  ] . 
On [LOC North Korea  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] hoped to hold “informal consultations” in [LOC Washington  ] on how generally to approach the [LOC North Koreans  ] , not just through the [MISC Six-Party Talks  ] . 
[LOC Washington  ] and [LOC Beijing  ] nevertheless needed to discuss how to maintain momentum in the [MISC Six-Party Talks  ] so as to preserve our common interest in stability of the [ORG Korean Peninsula  ] . 
[LOC North Korea  ] wanted to engage directly with the [LOC United States  ] and was therefore acting like a “spoiled child” in order to get the attention of the “adult.” [LOC China  ] therefore encouraged the [LOC United States  ] , “after some time , ” to start to re-engage the [LOC DPRK  ] . 
In this regard , it was good that the [ORG New York  ] channel remained open , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] observed . 
Noting that Special Representative for [LOC North Korea  ] Policy [PER Stephen Bosworth  ] would visit [LOC Beijing  ] in May , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that , if the [MISC Six-Party Talks  ] would be on hold for an extended period , then the Six Parties needed to find ways to continue to engage the [LOC DPRK  ] and each other , either bilaterally or even perhaps trilaterally . 
The [ORG Charge  ] noted that we should be careful not to reinforce Pyongyang’s bad behavior. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also hoped to discuss the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear issue in [LOC Washington  ] . 
[LOC Beijing  ] appreciated the “bold steps” taken by [LOC Washington  ] . 
[LOC China  ] had told [LOC Tehran  ] that this represented a good opportunity for [LOC Iran  ] to resume playing a positive role in the region . 
Though such an [MISC Iranian  ] role made moderate [MISC Arab  ] countries “jittery , ” [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , this should be a matter the [LOC United States  ] could “manage.” What was essential was to get [LOC Iran  ] involved positively in the region again. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he also hoped to discuss [ORG Afghanistan/Pakistan  ] . 
The [ORG Charge  ] stated that , even though [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was unable to announce new money for [LOC Afghanistan  ] at the April 17 [ORG Pakistan Donors’ Conference  ] , [LOC China  ] still had an opportunity to contribute to the security and stability of both [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
One way to do so would be to agree to a re-supply route via [LOC China  ] for [LOC U.S.  ] forces in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
On the re-supply route question , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [LOC China  ] would like to see a list of items that would be transported on the proposed route , noting that “non-lethal” is a broad and vague term . 
[LOC TIBET  ] AND [LOC TAIWAN  ] AS “CORE INTERESTS” ------------------------------------ <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] raised concerns over [ORG China’s  ] “core interests” of [LOC Tibet  ] and [LOC Taiwan  ] , which he said could “derail” bilateral cooperation . 
On [LOC Tibet  ] , [LOC China  ] had heard “rumors” that the [PER Dalai Lama  ] would attend a “seminar” in the [LOC United States  ] in late September or early October , and that President [PER Obama  ] was “likely” to meet with him then . 
Noting that there was no need for both sides to reiterate our respective positions on [LOC Tibet  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the critical question was whether both sides would agree to “take care” of each other’s “core interests.” When considering such sensitive issues in the context of the bilateral relationship , they could be viewed either as “obstacles” or as “core interests.” It did not matter whether one side “liked or disliked” such matters ; rather , in a “mature , close and important” bilateral relationship such as ours , the question was whether the key interests for each side would be accommodated . 
The [LOC United States  ] had its core interests , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] asserted , such as [LOC U.S.  ] naval vessels that had operated near the [MISC Chinese  ] coast . 
Both sides agreed to “step down” over that issue , despite the strongly held views of the [MISC Chinese  ] public . 
Regarding the [PER Dalai Lama  ] , [LOC China  ] hoped the [LOC United States  ] would deny him a visa , and if not , then agree to hold no official meetings with him , including no meeting with President [PER Obama.  ] <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) The [ORG Charge  ] expressed concern with [ORG China’s  ] defining [LOC Tibet  ] as a “core issue” with the apparent expectation that others would “step back.” Instead , our two sides should agree to continue to discuss the issue in an attempt to resolve our differences . 
The [LOC United States  ] recognized that [LOC Tibet  ] is a part of [LOC China  ] . 
Nevertheless , the [PER Dalai Lama  ] is a respected religious leader and [PER Nobel Laureate  ] , and [LOC U.S.  ] officials meet with him in that capacity . 
Future meetings by [LOC U.S.  ] officials with the [PER Dalai Lama  ] could not be ruled out . 
Moreover , there were serious concerns among the [LOC U.S.  ] public , the [ORG Administration  ] and [ORG Congress  ] over the situation in [MISC Tibetan  ] areas of [LOC China  ] . 
[LOC China  ] should take steps to address [MISC Tibetans’  ] legitimate grievances and engage the [PER Dalai Lama’s  ] representatives in productive dialogue . 
Denying a visa to the [PER Dalai Lama  ] was not being contemplated . 
[LOC BEIJING  ] 00001176 004 OF 005 <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) Another issue that could “derail” relations was arms sales to [LOC Taiwan  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said . 
[LOC China  ] had long opposed [LOC U.S.  ] arms sales to [LOC Taiwan  ] , especially advanced weapons sales . 
[LOC China  ] was concerned by reports of possible “very important” and “potent” arms sales to [LOC Taiwan  ] , including 60 Blackhawk helicopters and [MISC F-16  ] C/D fighter aircraft . 
Such arms sales were a “very serious issue” for [LOC China  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said . 
The [ORG Charge  ] replied that there had been no change to our one [LOC China  ] policy based on the three joint communiques and the [MISC Taiwan Relations Act  ] ( [ORG TRA  ] ) . 
In accordance with the [ORG TRA  ] , the [LOC United States  ] made available to [LOC Taiwan  ] defense articles that allowed [LOC Taiwan  ] to maintain a credible defense . 
The [ORG Charge  ] urged [LOC China  ] to take steps to reduce military deployments aimed at [LOC Taiwan  ] . 
HUMAN RIGHTS: [PER LIU XIAOBO  ] , [PER GAO ZHISHENG  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) The [ORG Charge  ] raised two human rights cases , inquiring as to the status , location and treatment of dissident writer and [ORG Charter  ] 08 signatory [PER Liu Xiaobo  ] and rights lawyer [PER Gao Zhisheng  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] replied that , as a sign of the “maturity” of our bilateral relationship , he had “repeatedly” listened to our concerns regarding these two cases . 
Both cases would be handled “according to law” and in accordance with [ORG China’s  ] legal/judicial system . 
Such cases were “sensitive” and should be handled “carefully , ” [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , pledging that he nevertheless would look into the cases “to the extent possible.” NORTH KOREAN “GUESTS” --------------------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [ORG Charge  ] emphasized the importance of expediting exit procedures from [LOC China  ] for two [LOC North Koreans  ] who had entered the Embassy compound and asked for XXXXXXXXXXXX’s assistance in doing so . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he would look into the matter . 
[LOC U.S.  ] JOURNALISTS DETAINED IN [LOC DPRK  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) The [ORG Charge  ] urged [LOC China  ] to press the [LOC DPRK  ] to release the two [MISC American  ] journalists detained in [LOC North Korea  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] replied that the [LOC United States  ] could “rest assured” that [LOC China  ] would do so . 
[ORG UNSC  ] REFORM ----------- <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) [LOC China  ] was concerned by “momentum” that was building on [ORG UN Security Council  ] reform , which was “not good” for the [MISC P-5  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said . 
[LOC China  ] wanted the [LOC United States  ] to maintain its position on [ORG UNSC  ] reform and not be “proactive” on the matter , which the [ORG PRC  ] feared could result in a [ORG UN General Assembly  ] resolution on the subject . 
The [MISC P-5  ] “club” should not be “diluted , ” [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said . 
If we end up with a “P-10 , ” both [LOC China  ] and the [LOC United States  ] would “be in trouble.” Moreover , it would be difficult for the [MISC Chinese  ] public to accept [LOC Japan  ] as a permanent member of the [ORG UNSC  ] . 
The [ORG Charge  ] replied that the [ORG Administration  ] had not completed its policy review on [ORG UNSC  ] expansion , so we do not yet have a position on specific proposals . 
Nonetheless , the [LOC United States  ] believed that [ORG UN  ] members should be allowed to state their positions freely and openly without undue [MISC P-5  ] influence . 
Regarding [LOC Japan  ] , the [ORG Charge  ] said that , while no decision had been made about which countries to support for permanent membership on the [ORG UNSC  ] , it was hard to envision any expansion of the [ORG Council  ] that did not include [LOC Japan  ] , which was the second-largest contributor to the [ORG UN  ] budget . 
[ORG COCA  ] II: AVOIDING A “TRADE WAR” -------------------------------- <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) The [ORG Charge  ] expressed concern that differences regarding a Conditions of [MISC Construction Agreement  ] ( [ORG COCA  ] ) [ORG II  ] for our new Consulate General in [LOC Guangzhou  ] had begun to leak into other areas . 
The [ORG Charge  ] asked [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] to speak with the appropriate [ORG PRC  ] officials to stop this trend before significant damage was done . 
The [ORG COCA II  ] team from [LOC Washington  ] held good discussions in [LOC Beijing  ] last week with MFA [ORG DG for Administrative Affairs Li Chao  ] regarding the new [ORG CG Guangzhou  ] complex . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy today had formally invited [ORG DG Li  ] to [LOC Washington  ] in May for further talks . 
One serious problem , the [ORG Charge  ] noted , was the [MISC Chinese  ] having moved to block new housing leases for the [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy in [LOC BEIJING  ] 00001176 005 OF 005 [LOC Beijing  ] in an apparent attempt to gain leverage on office properties . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said this situation sounded like a “trade war.” The [ORG Charge  ] asked [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] to help stop this matter before it led to a downward cycle . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he believed real progress had been made and differences narrowed during the most recent round of [ORG COCA II  ] talks and that [LOC China  ] did not want a “trade war” over [ORG COCA II  ] issues . 
He pledged to “look into” the matter .
