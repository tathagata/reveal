( C ) On March 20 , the [MISC Libyan  ] General People 's Committee for Foreign Liaison and [ORG International Cooperation  ] ( [ORG MFA-equivalent  ] ) delivered a diplomatic note proposing the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Libya  ] sign a bilateral aviation agreement and that state-owned [ORG Afriqiyah Airlines  ] start regular flights to the [LOC United States  ] in the summer of 2009 . 
Attached to the note was an [MISC Arabic  ] translation of a 14-page aviation agreement . 
The text of the diplomatic note said the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Civil Aviation Authority  ] had expressed its initial approval of the provisions included in the agreement . 
This agreement appears to be an [MISC Arabic  ] translation of the 2001 [ORG Multilateral Agreement  ] on the [ORG Liberalization of International Air Transportation  ] ( [ORG MALIAT  ] ) with [LOC New Zealand  ] , [LOC Singapore  ] , [LOC Brunei  ] , and [LOC Chile  ] . 
The note also said that the [ORG GOL  ] would like to sign a bilateral aviation agreement with the [LOC United States  ] during the visit of a high-level [MISC Libyan  ] official in late April or early May . 
Post has sent via unclassified e-mail the diplomatic note and attachment to [MISC NEA/MAG.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Post had no prior knowledge that [LOC Libya  ] wanted to negotiate an aviation agreement or commence direct flights by one of its state-owned airlines to the [LOC United States  ] . 
( [PER Note: Wholly-owned  ] by the [MISC Libyan  ] government , [ORG Afriqiyah Airlines  ] was established in 2001 with the goal of providing air service to the [MISC African  ] continent . 
Its livery features the logo , " 9.9.99 " , a reference to the date of the " [MISC Sirte Proclamation  ] , " an agreement by [MISC African  ] states reached in [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] 's home-town that led to the creation of the [ORG African Union  ] . 
The other state-owned airline is [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Arab Airlines  ] . 
End note ) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Post seeks Department 's advice in responding to the [ORG GOL  ] 's request . 
It would be helpful to be able to address the following questions: -If [LOC Libya  ] wants to sign onto the 2001 [ORG Multilateral Agreement  ] on the [ORG Liberalization of International Air Transportation  ] ( [ORG MALIAT  ] ) , is it eligible to do so ? -If [LOC Libya  ] seeks a bilateral agreement with the [LOC United States  ] , what are the next steps ? -If [LOC Libya  ] wants to commence direct flights between [LOC Tripoli  ] and a [LOC U.S.  ] airport , what requirements would need to be met ?
