REASONS: 1.4 ( B , D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY: The five doctors who worked inside the final conflict zone ( the government-declared “no-fire zone” ) and who released accounts of the situation and the numbers of killed and wounded civilians there gave a press conference press conference on July 8 . 
The doctors said they were “pressured” by the [ORG LTTE  ] to release the casualty figures during the fighting , and that in reality the number of killed and wounded civilians was much lower . 
Many international observers doubt the veracity of this “confession” , and casualty figures from other sources are inconsistent with the numbers given by the doctors at the press conference . 
Some have said the doctors were told they must make this sort of statement or be prosecuted for assisting the [ORG LTTE  ] . 
It is not known if they will in fact be released soon , but it appears they have been treated relatively well while in detention . 
There is some concern for their safety if the doctors are in fact released . 
END SUMMARY . 
2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The five doctors who served in the conflict zone during the final weeks and months of the war , and who provided eyewitness accounts of the situation there during the final months of the conflict between the [ORG GSL  ] and the [ORG LTTE  ] publicly retracted their previous statements during a press conference arranged by the Government on July 8 . 
The doctors announced that they were “pressured” by the [ORG LTTE  ] to make the original statements . 
The five were taken into custody by the [ORG Army  ] at the end of the conflict in May , but are now in [ORG CID  ] ( police ) custody . 
They said they have been treated well and have been given medical attention . 
They noted in their statements that during the conflict they had exaggerated the number of killed and injured and also stated that there had never been a shortage of food in the zone . 
The doctors reported that in reality many civilians were killed trying to escape the [ORG LTTE  ] and that the [ORG LTTE  ] had commandeered medical supplies brought into the zone for civilians for the wounded [ORG LTTE  ] cadres . 
They said [ORG LTTE  ] officials would hand them lists of figures to cite , and then give them phone numbers of sympathetic journalists to contact with the reports . 
The doctors stated that the actual number of civilian deaths from January until the end of the conflict in mid-May was between 600 and 650 , with 1,200 injured during that same time period. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) International media and [ORG NGOs  ] are skeptical of the doctors’ statements at the news conference . 
Credible local [ORG NGO  ] sources have said the families were told the doctors may be released following such confessions and they may have had to videotape individual confessions for the president . 
While it is difficult to pin down solid numbers on anything that happened in the last months of the conflict , other relatively verifiable sources of information are clearly at odds with these figures . 
The [ORG ICRC  ] reported on May 12 that since mid-February it had evacuated nearly 14,000 sick or wounded civilians and their relatives . 
Unofficial UN estimates for [MISC Tamil  ] civilian deaths over roughly the same January to mid-May time period are more than ten times as high , between 7,000 and 8,000 . 
Those UN estimates did not rigorously seek to exclude deaths of possible [ORG LTTE  ] conscripts , but it is unlikely that a ten-fold increase in figures over what the doctors stated this week would be due solely to deaths of [ORG LTTE  ] cadres mixed in with the civilian population . 
4 . 
( S ) Of particular concern is what will happen to the doctors if in fact they are released soon . 
In a meeting with the Ambassador on May 20 , the [ORG Defense Secretary  ] indicated that it would probably not be safe to free the doctors until [PER COLOMBO  ] 00000695 002.3 OF 002 after passions had cooled . 
More recently a senior contact in the [ORG CID  ] was demoted because he had worked to improve the detention conditions of the doctors and apparently had expressed too strong of a desire to improve their welfare . 
5 . 
( C ) COMMENT: The dead and wounded figures given by the doctors at the July 8 press conference would appear to underestimate the true number of casualties during the final months of conflict in the no-fire zone . 
The [ORG GSL  ] appears to be continuing its efforts to downplay the extent of civilian suffering during the last weeks and days of the war . 
However , a willingness to arrange for the doctors to be released following this confession could signal an effort by the [ORG GSL  ] to appease international criticism . 
If the doctors are released , it will be critical for the [ORG GSL  ] to take meaningful action to ensure that the doctors are not then “disappeared” in order to prevent them from making any modifications to this press statement .
