Ranneberger  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) Summary: [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy [ORG Nairobi  ] warmly welcomes CODEL [PER Marshall  ] and looks forward to your September 1-3 visit . 
We note your questions regarding media reports that pressure in Iraq/Afghanistan has prompted al-Qa , ida to shift some of its operations/efforts to [LOC Somalia  ] ( ref A ) . 
To address this question , we have reviewed a body of available information from press , embassy , and other reporting . 
The rise of al-Shabaab and the increase in foreign fighters operating in [LOC Somalia  ] warrants significant concern ; several al-Qa , ida operatives , most notably [PER Saleh Nabhan  ] , have a history of involvement in [LOC East Africa  ] and are currently cooperating with al-Shabaab leaders and involved in training foreign fighters in [LOC Somalia  ] . 
We speculate that , due to pressure especially in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , al-Qa , ida could consider [LOC Somalia  ] a safer training ground for foreign fighters , some of whom may intend subsequently to travel to [LOC Afghanistan  ] or [LOC Iraq  ] . 
However , based on a review of foreign fighter trends and al-Qa , ida/al-Shabaab operations , we are unable to establish a strong correlation between recent military pressure on al-Qa , ida in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] and increased al-Qa , ida influence/efforts in [LOC Somalia  ] . 
Nonetheless , there is a clear threat from al-Qaida linked extremists and growing numbers of foreign fighters in [LOC Somalia  ] over the past several years , which are directly challenging the efforts of the [ORG Transitional Federal Government  ] ( [ORG TFG  ] ) to establish itself . 
End Summary . 
Foreign Fighters: Origins and [MISC Motivations  ] ----------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) Many of the foreign fighters currently operating in [LOC Somalia  ] , particularly those who entered to fight the [MISC Ethiopians  ] from 2006-2008 , are ethnic [MISC Somalis  ] , recruited from either neighboring countries or diasporas overseas and motivated in the past by a sense of [MISC Somali  ] nationalism , jihadist propaganda , and the presence of foreign troops in the country . 
As widely covered in the press , this includes [MISC North Americans  ] , including at least 20 young men who were recruited from [LOC Minneapolis  ] alone , and recruits from [MISC European  ] countries with large [MISC Somali  ] diasporas . 
Fighters have also come from within [LOC East Africa  ] , most notably [LOC Kenya  ] and [LOC Sudan  ] . 
In addition , press reports and our conversations with [MISC Somali  ] government officials note the presence of an unknown number of non-Somali fighters from [LOC South Asia  ] and the [LOC Middle East  ] , including [MISC Pakistanis  ] , [MISC Yemenis  ] , and other unidentified &Arabs8 . 
We speculate some of these fighters may have chosen , or been directed to , [LOC Somalia  ] for training and to gain jihadist experiences because [LOC Somalia  ] currently affords comparatively greater safety for camps and other sites than [LOC South Asia  ] or [LOC Iraq.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) Neither we nor the [MISC Somali  ] government knows exactly how many foreign fighters are in [LOC Somalia  ] , as reporting varies widely . 
Statements by [MISC Somali  ] government officials mention several thousand foreigners , which we believe are exaggerations , or at best estimations based on fighter sightings and rumors . 
During the intense May and June fighting in [LOC Mogadishu  ] , there were numerous reports of foreign fighters interspersed with al-Shabaab , likely directed from camps in [LOC Southern Somalia  ] as reinforcements . 
Conversations with [MISC Somali  ] political leaders , suggest that as of mid-August , significant numbers of al-Shabaab forces have left [LOC Mogadishu  ] and dispersed across southern and central regions of [LOC Somalia.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) The timing and motivation of foreign fighters arriving in [LOC Somalia  ] appears tied to perceptions of internal [MISC Somali  ] dynamics . 
Our conversations with [MISC Somali  ] political leaders highlight that some foreigners were already present during the [ORG Council of Islamic Courts  ] period , and that the [MISC Ethiopian  ] intervention in 2006 both prompted some foreigners to flee , and provided motivation for a new influx of foreign fighters , including ethnic [MISC Somalis  ] determined to drive [LOC Ethiopia  ] out of [LOC Somalia  ] . 
Al-Shabaab , s territorial gains in 2008 , and the subsequent [MISC Ethiopian  ] withdrawal from [LOC Somalia  ] in January 2009 , prompted additional foreign fighters to join what was seen as a successful struggle . 
Regardless of their initial motivations , these young recruits are subject to indoctrination and use by violent , often foreign , extremists , [ORG NAIROBI  ] 00001801 002 OF 003 as demonstrated by [PER Shirwa Ahmed  ] , an ethnic [MISC Somali  ] from [LOC Minneapolis  ] who became one of the suicide-bombers perpetrating multiple attacks in [LOC Puntland  ] and [LOC Somaliland  ] on October 29 , 2009. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) Al-Qa , ida leaders in early 2009 publicly endorsed the [LOC Somalia  ] &jihad , 8 capitalizing on al-Shabaab , s gains by launching a rhetoric campaign designed to encourage aspiring jihadis to travel to [LOC Somalia  ] , and portraying [MISC Somali  ] President [PER Sharif  ] as illegitimate . 
In the first half of 2009 , [ORG Al-Qa'ida  ] issued several videos praising al-Shabaab , denouncing President [PER Sharif  ] , s government , and urging fighters to travel to [LOC Somalia  ] . 
Most notable among these propaganda efforts was a statement attributed to [PER Usama Bin Laden  ] titled &Fight on Champions of [LOC Somalia  ] , 8 and similar videos by senior al-Qa , ida leaders , including [PER Aymen  ] al-Zawahiri and [PER Abu-Yahya al-Libi  ] ( Ref B ) . <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) Beyond the public support from al-Qa , ida videos encouraging foreign fighters to travel to [LOC Somalia  ] , there is scant evidence of significant direct al-Qa , ida financial or military support for extremists in [LOC Somalia  ] , or a foreign fighter pipeline from [LOC Iraq  ] or [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Other support for [MISC Somali  ] militants , largely in the form of financing and smuggled weapons , comes from a variety of sources including [LOC Eritrea  ] and conduits through [LOC Eritrea  ] , diaspora remittances , smuggling from [LOC Yemen  ] , and likely business donors in the [MISC Gulf States  ] . 
These appear to be important external sources of support for anti-TFG militants in [LOC Somalia.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) Within [LOC Somalia  ] , al-Shabaab , s core leaders cooperate with several al-Qa , ida operatives with a long history in the region . 
Most notably , [PER Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan  ] , who was active during the 2006 [ORG Council of Islamic Courts  ] , and currently remains in [LOC Somalia  ] , has made a concerted effort to cooperate with key al-Shabaab leaders , and is actively recruiting and training foreign fighters . 
These senior level extremists are long-time operatives in [LOC East Africa  ] , rather than new arrivals from [LOC Iraq  ] or [LOC Afghanistan  ] , although the new influx of foreign jihadis likely contains individuals with agenda 's beyond the [MISC Somali  ] insurgency . 
[PER Nabhan  ] , with his transnational agenda and involvement in training foreigners , makes the situation even more dangerous . 
[MISC Kenyan  ] CT Efforts ----------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [MISC Kenyan  ] security officials have worked to address the threat of terrorism in [LOC Kenya  ] , and are aware of the trend in foreign fighters and the smuggling of support to al-Shabaab , some of which transits [LOC Kenya  ] . 
[LOC Kenya  ] fears that al-Shabaab will begin conducting cross border attacks , and has deployed military forces to positions in eastern and northern [LOC Kenya  ] near the [MISC Somali  ] border . 
[LOC Kenya  ] has attempted to close this border , but the consistent flow of [MISC Somali  ] refugees demonstrates the difficulties inherent to controlling this long , porous , and largely unregulated border region . 
In addition , the [ORG TFG  ] and the Government of [LOC Kenya  ] are secretly considering an offensive in the [LOC Juba  ] region of [LOC Somalia  ] , aimed at pushing al-Shabaab out of the key port of [LOC Kismayo  ] and neighboring areas in [LOC Southern Somalia  ] ( reftel C ) . 
Comment ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) While we speculate that al-Qa , ida may consider [LOC Somalia  ] a relatively safer location for foreign fighter training camps , at this point , al-Qa , ida , s efforts to &shift8 focus towards [LOC Somalia  ] appear to have consisted primarily of the aforementioned publicity campaign . 
There is some indication that vigorous effort by the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [MISC Kenyans  ] may have disrupted efforts by al-Qa'ida and the al-Shabaab to work more closely together . 
Even as a degree of increased stability in [LOC Iraq  ] , and military pressure in [LOC Afghanistan  ] may have encouraged a small number of foreign fighters to choose [LOC Somalia  ] as an alternate venue for jihad , we lack evidence of significant numbers of fighters previously engaged in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] diverting to [LOC Somalia  ] . 
Likewise , while there are widespread reports of [MISC Pakistani  ] and [MISC Arab  ] fighters in [LOC Somalia  ] , the timing and influx of these fighters appear primarily tied to developments in [LOC Somalia  ] and perceptions of [LOC Somalia  ] as a suitable location for [ORG NAIROBI  ] 00001801 003 OF 003 jihad . 
Nevertheless , al-Qa , ida operatives coordinate with al-Shabaab , s core leaders , and continue to use [LOC Somalia  ] as a staging and training base .
