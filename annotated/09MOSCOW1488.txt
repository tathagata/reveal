( C ) Summary: [MISC Israeli  ] FM [PER Lieberman  ] 's June 2-3 visit to [LOC Russia  ] appears not to have broken new ground diplomatically , but cemented [LOC Moscow  ] 's impression that the [MISC Russian-speaking  ] [PER Lieberman  ] is one of their own . 
The trip included meetings with [PER Medvedev  ] and [PER Putin  ] , as well as a lengthy discussion with FM [PER Lavrov  ] , during which [PER Lieberman  ] indicated that [LOC Israel  ] was not considering a military strike on [LOC Iran  ] . 
Both sides agreed to hold off on scheduling the [LOC Moscow  ] ME conference until after President [PER Obama  ] 's visit to [LOC Moscow  ] , and [PER Lavrov  ] quizzed [PER Lieberman  ] on a possible [LOC U.S.  ] plan to bring together [MISC Israeli  ] and [MISC Palestinian  ] leaders .

[PER Lavrov  ] said that " nothing new " could happen on [LOC Iran  ] until the [LOC U.S.  ] opened its dialogue with [LOC Tehran  ] , and repeated [MISC Russian  ] concerns about the need to reach a negotiated settlement with this " important neighbor . 
" He reiterated that [LOC Russia  ] had not transferred [MISC S-300s  ] to [LOC Iran  ] , but also had to consider its contract to provide the missiles to [LOC Tehran  ] . 
[PER Lavrov  ] thanked [LOC Israel  ] for limiting military sales to [LOC Georgia  ] , but thought other countries were supplying offensive weapons to [LOC Tiblisi  ] , which could be emboldened to start " another adventure . 
" The [MISC FMs  ] discussed expanding bilateral economic ties , and [PER Lavrov  ] raised [MISC Russian  ] concern that [LOC Israel  ] was partaking in " historical revisionism " that sought to blame [LOC Russia  ] for the [MISC Ukrainian  ] famine of the 1930s . 
End summary . 
[PER Behaved Like  ] an [MISC Old Friend  ] -------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [MISC Israeli  ] DCM [PER Yuval Fuchs  ] told us that FM [PER Lieberman  ] 's June 2-3 visit to [LOC Russia  ] ran the gamut of international and bilateral issues , from the peace process to the payment of [MISC Soviet-era  ] pensions to [MISC Russian  ] speakers living in [LOC Israel  ] . 
His visit centered upon a two-hour June 2 meeting with FM [PER Lavrov  ] that [PER Fuchs  ] characterized as a standard presentation of views , during which " nothing breathtaking " was said . 
[PER Lieberman  ] had a hectic day that began with a meeting at [PER Medvedev  ] 's home on the outskirts of [LOC Moscow  ] , then the [PER Lavrov  ] meeting at the [ORG MFA  ] , a flight to [LOC St. Petersburg  ] on a chartered plane to see [PER Putin  ] , and dinner with [PER Lavrov  ] upon returning to [LOC Moscow  ] . 
On June 3 , [PER Lieberman  ] had breakfast with former FM [PER Igor Ivanov  ] ( a personal friend ) , meetings with the heads of the [ORG Duma  ] and [ORG Federation Council  ] international affairs committees , discussions with [MISC Russian  ] Jewish leaders , and a press conference . 
He then departed [LOC Moscow  ] for [LOC Minsk.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Fuchs  ] explained that [PER Lieberman  ] conducted his meetings in [MISC Russian  ] , shared stories about [LOC Moscow  ] , and smoked , creating a comfortable atmosphere with his [MISC Russian  ] interlocutors . 
The [MISC Israeli  ] FM " behaved like an old friend " commented [PER Fuchs  ] , who thought that the [MISC Russians  ] acted as if they already knew him , although it was too early to say whether this personal diplomacy would have a measurable effect on already strong [MISC Russia-Israel  ] relations . 
[MISC Lavrov-Lieberman  ] ---------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Fuchs  ] said that during the meeting with [PER Lavrov  ] , the [ORG GOR  ] 's planned [LOC Moscow  ] ME conference was not a central topic for either side . 
[PER Lieberman  ] stressed the importance of coordinating such efforts with the [LOC U.S.  ] , and said it would not be appropriate to set the timing of a conference until after President [PER Obama  ] 's visit to [LOC Moscow  ] . 
[PER Lavrov  ] agreed , and said that [LOC Moscow  ] did not want to hold a conference that would not produce results . 
[PER Lavrov  ] asked [PER Lieberman  ] if [LOC Israel  ] was aware of an idea supposedly floated by [PER S/E Mitchell  ] to bring together [MISC Israeli  ] and [MISC Palestinian  ] leaders ; [PER Lieberman  ] said no. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Lavrov  ] pressed [LOC Israel  ] to open checkpoints into [LOC Gaza  ] , and suggested posting international monitors to allay [MISC Israeli  ] concerns regarding smuggling . 
When [PER Lavrov  ] argued that [ORG Hamas  ] had stuck by the [LOC Gaza  ] cease-fire , [PER Lieberman  ] retorted that [ORG Hamas  ] would break the cease-fire when it believed doing so suited its needs . 
[PER Lavrov  ] also pressed [LOC Israel  ] to freeze the settlements , leading [PER Lieberman  ] to respond that " life goes on " and settlement expansion was necessary to accommodate growing communities. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Fuchs  ] said that [PER Lavrov  ] criticized the [LOC U.S.  ] on several fronts , telling [PER Lieberman  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] invasion of [LOC Iraq  ] was a " present " to [LOC Iran  ] , and the [LOC U.S.  ] decision to isolate [LOC Syria  ] was a " setback " for a comprehensive ME settlement . 
Furthermore , the [LOC U.S.  ] failure to " listen " to [LOC Russia  ] , which [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00001488 002 OF 002 advised against [MISC Palestinian  ] elections , had allowed [ORG Hamas  ] to come to power and eventually take over [LOC Gaza  ] , thereby strengthening [LOC Iran  ] 's position in the region . 
[LOC Syria  ] ----- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Lavrov  ] thought that the [MISC Turkish-led  ] negotiations between [LOC Israel  ] and [LOC Syria  ] had been positive , and said that during his recent visit to [LOC Damascus  ] , the [MISC Syrians  ] indicated that they were ready to renew talks either through [LOC Turkey  ] or [LOC Russia  ] so long as they would include the future of the [LOC Golan Heights  ] . 
[PER Lavrov  ] said that he raised with [ORG Hamas  ] leaders the need to allow visits to captured [ORG IDF  ] soldier [PER Gilad Shalit  ] . 
[PER Lieberman  ] asked if [MISC Russian  ] officials could visit [PER Shalit  ] , and [PER Lavrov  ] directed [PER DFM Saltanov  ] to explore this possibility . 
[LOC Iran  ] ---- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Lavrov  ] predicted that " nothing new " would happen with [LOC Iran  ] until after the [LOC U.S.  ] began its dialogue with [LOC Tehran  ] , although he thought there was a better chance to get a " clear answer " from [LOC Iran  ] on P5 1 proposals under the current [ORG U.S. Administration  ] . 
He reiterated that [LOC Russia  ] did not believe there existed hard evidence that [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program had a military dimension , and thought it transparent enough to detect whether resources were directed to military uses. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Lavrov  ] expressed [MISC Russian  ] interest in reaching a negotiated solution to the crisis surrounding [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program , and the need for the West to normalize relations with [LOC Tehran  ] , a close [MISC Russian  ] neighbor with which it shared the [ORG Caspian  ] and its resources . 
He raised [MISC Russian  ] concern that an [MISC Israeli  ] attack on [LOC Iran  ] would cause instability in the region and an influx of refugees into the [LOC Caucasus  ] . 
[PER Fuchs  ] said that [PER Lieberman  ] responded that [LOC Israel  ] " was not talking about such a response " and understood that an attack would cause a " chain reaction " within the region . 
[PER Lieberman  ] made similar statements suggesting that [LOC Israel  ] was not considering attacking [LOC Iran  ] during his press conference. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Lavrov  ] reiterated that [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC Iran  ] had signed a deal to provide [MISC S-300s  ] , but that [LOC Russia  ] had not transferred any weapons . 
The [ORG GOR  ] did not intend to provide regionally destabilizing weapons , but also had to take into account how it would be perceived by others if [LOC Moscow  ] failed to fulfill its contract with [LOC Tehran  ] . 
[LOC Georgia  ] ------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Lavrov  ] expressed [MISC Russian  ] appreciation for [MISC Israeli  ] steps to limit arms sales to [LOC Georgia  ] to defensive weapons , but raised concern that other countries were supplying offensive weapons . 
He was also concerned that the recent military exercises [LOC Georgia  ] conducted with [ORG NATO  ] might push [MISC Tiblisi  ] to undertake " another adventure " . 
Bilateral Issues ---------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Fuchs  ] said that much of the discussion between [PER Lavrov  ] and [PER Lieberman  ] focused on expanding bilateral ties , especially in the economic sphere . 
They also touched upon parochial issues of concern to [PER Lieberman  ] and his constituents , such as the payment of pensions owed by the [LOC Soviet Union  ] and [LOC Russia  ] to Russian-speaking [ORG Israelis.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Lavrov  ] raised [MISC Russian  ] concern with " historical revisionism " regarding the [MISC Soviet  ] [ORG Era  ] and Second [MISC World War  ] , which , he said , was particularly acute in [LOC Eastern Europe  ] but was also present in [LOC Israel  ] . 
He cited [LOC Israel  ] 's official recognition of the [LOC Holodomor  ] , the 1930s famine that occurred in [LOC Ukraine  ] . 
[PER Lieberman  ] explained that by recognizing this tragedy , [LOC Israel  ] had not said [LOC Russia  ] was guilty of causing it , nor that it was an act of genocide .
