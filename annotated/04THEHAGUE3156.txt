<code><pre>S E C R E T THE HAGUE 003156 SIPDIS STATE FOR EUR/UBI/HOLLIDAY STATE PLEASE PASS DOD FOR N.BRELAND E.O. 12958: [LOC DECL:  ] 12/02/2014 TAGS: <a href='/tag/KSTC_0.html'>KSTC</a> <a href='/tag/ETTC_0.html'>ETTC</a> <a href='/tag/PARM_0.html'>PARM</a> <a href='/tag/NL_0.html'>NL</a> <a href='/tag/CH_0.html'>CH</a> SUBJECT: [MISC DUTCH  ] PROPOSE PARTS CONTROL PLANS FOR 14-BIT [ORG ADC SALES REF:  ] 239012 [ORG Classified By: Economics Counselor Richard Huff for Reasons  ] 1.4 ( B ) and ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) On November 15 , [PER Chris Kessler  ] , [ORG Export Control Non-Proliferation  ] office director , [PER Nicole Breland  ] , [ORG Department of Defense  ] export control policy advisor , and embassy econoff ( note taker ) briefed the non-paper ( reftel ) to [MISC Dutch  ] ministry of foreign affairs , economic affairs and defense officials responsible for dual use technology export policy . 
[PER George Bontenbal  ] , director of the [ORG Ministry of Economic Affairs'  ] office of [ORG Export Control and Strategic Goods  ] policy led the [MISC Dutch  ] delegation <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Bontenbal  ] thanked the [LOC U.S.  ] side for its information and remarked that [ORG Huawei  ] , for example , was among the largest telecommunications base station manufacturers in [LOC China  ] and a probable [ORG Philips  ] customer . 
Note: [ORG Philips  ] manufactures 14-bit ADCs , but according to the [MISC Dutch  ] as yet has not sold these to [MISC Chinese  ] companies . 
End Note . 
He thought the [ORG USG  ] and [ORG GONL  ] should draw a distinction between [ORG Huawei  ] 's civilian telecommunications manufacturing and their defense related work for the [MISC PLA.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Kessler  ] countered that it was unreasonable to expect that the civilian division of a partially [MISC PLA-owned  ] company would not share its western bought technology with the defense division . 
Firms that are established defense contractors to the [ORG PLA  ] and have extensive ties to [LOC PRC  ] national security agencies cannot be expected or trusted to maintain impermeable fire-walls ; we know they do not . 
The only companies that can be trusted , even on the basis of the rigorous conditions and parts control plan approach we have discussed , are those that are strictly focused on the civilian market , and therefore have strong incentives to avoid leakage. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Nevertheless , [PER Bontenbal  ] said the [ORG GONL  ] preferred requiring end-use conditions and parts control plans , requiring [ORG ADC  ] buyers to track and account for their [ORG ADC  ] inventory , rather than prohibiting altogether [ORG ADC  ] sales to certain companies . 
It would be hard , he concluded , to shut out [ORG Huawei  ] , one of the biggest players in [LOC China  ] 's third generation cell phone program . 
[PER Bontenbal  ] suggested the [MISC Dutch  ] would agree to require parts control programs for [ORG ADC  ] sales to [MISC Chinese  ] companies , rather than excluding the companies all together . 
He confided that [ORG Philips  ] wants to sell 14-bit ADCs to [ORG Huawei  ] soon . 
With this in mind , the [ORG GONL  ] had been drafting sales contract language requiring 14-bit [ORG ADC  ] buyers to put parts control programs in place for the converters . 
He offered to share the [MISC Dutch  ] contract conditions with the [LOC U.S.  ] , probably sometime in mid-December .
