[PER Marie L. Yovanovitch  ] , reasons 1.4 ( b , d ) SUMMARY AND COMMENT -------------------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The separate meetings on January 14 with [ORG NSS  ] Chairman [PER Hakobian  ] and President [PER Sargsian  ] regarding the [LOC Iran  ] export control issue were both positive and constructive . 
[PER Sargsian  ] acknowledged the weapons purchase from [LOC Bulgaria  ] , and neither he nor the [ORG NSS  ] Chairman challenged our information that these weapons were then transferred to [MISC Iran/Iraq  ] . 
Both men indicated that there would be an investigation into how the weapons went from [LOC Armenia  ] to [MISC Iran/Iraq  ] . 
[PER Hakobian  ] seemed to indicate that the blame most probably lay with the [MISC Bulgarians  ] and perhaps unauthorized [MISC Armenians  ] acting on their own . 
Probably in an attempt to minimize [LOC U.S.  ] demands , they also noted that there have been significant reforms and personnel changes since the incident . 
The President reiterated that cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] , including on security and export control , was an [MISC Armenian  ] priority , and that the [ORG GOAM  ] , with the [ORG NSS  ] as the lead , would discuss the proposed Memorandum of Understanding with the expert team on January 15. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Somewhat surprisingly , the President has reversed the mantra he has repeated for the last four months that the weapons transfer “did not happen and could not have happened.” It , s not clear what has prompted this abrupt climb down , but it is probably some combination of solid evidence , a compelling presentation , an understanding of the consequences non- cooperation could bring , a desire to get off on the right foot with the new administration -- and a [MISC Soviet-style  ] calculation that they can sign the [ORG MOU  ] , but probably won , t really have to implement it . 
While there will no doubt be hard questions during the meeting on the [ORG MOU  ] and actual implementation will pose even greater challenges , we are -- unexpectedly -- in the best place we could be going into discussions on the [ORG MOU  ] . 
END SUMMARY AND COMMENT . 
MEETING WITH [ORG NSS  ] CHAIRMAN HAKOBIAN: BETTER THAN EXPECTED --------------------------------------------- ----------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Ambassador [PER Mahley  ] and his delegation met with [ORG NSS  ] Chairman [PER Hakobian  ] on January 14 to discuss [LOC Armenia  ] , s role in an arms transfer to [LOC Iran  ] , from which point they were later transferred onward to insurgents in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[ORG NSS  ] Chairman [PER Hakobian  ] indicated that [LOC Armenia  ] was ready to cooperate on this case and to have a dialogue with the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Hakobian  ] emphasized throughout the meeting that [LOC Armenia  ] has undergone significant changes over the last several years and there are new people in the government since 2003 , when this transfer occurred . 
[PER Hakobian  ] also highlighted that two Deputy Defense Ministers had been fired since the transfer happened . 
[PER Mahley  ] thanked [PER Hakobian  ] for his remarks and said he was here to discuss a tough issue , which reflected the good relationship between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Armenia  ] and that this type of discussion that friends have . 
[PER Hakobian  ] reiterated that [LOC Armenia  ] values that relationship. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) [PER Mahley  ] , drawing from the points in paragraph 18 , laid out the [LOC U.S.  ] evidence for our assertion that [LOC Armenia  ] facilitated [LOC Iran  ] , s acquisition of [ORG RPG-22s  ] and [ORG PKM  ] machine guns , which have been recovered in arms caches of [MISC Iranian-  ] sponsored insurgent groups in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
This exchange , which was promised by [PER Sectary Rice  ] , included reviewing the documentary evidence . 
During the course of our investigation the markings on the weapons indicated that they originated in [LOC Bulgaria  ] , and we were able to subsequently determine the lot numbers on the [ORG RPG-22s  ] corresponded with the production of 1000 items , all of which were shipped to [LOC Armenia  ] along with the [ORG PKM  ] machine guns . 
In addition , we shared with [PER Hakobian  ] that in early January 2003 , the [MISC Bulgarian  ] firm [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and the [MISC Armenian  ] [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] concluded a deal to purchase the [ORG RPG-22s  ] and the [ORG PKM  ] machine guns ; the [MISC Armenian  ] [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] served as an intermediary in the transaction . 
INR analyst [PER Stewart Eales  ] then reviewed the documentary evidence that we had to support this conclusion . 
First , as part of this deal an end-user certificate from [LOC Armenia  ] was signed by then- Defense Minister [PER Sargsian  ] . 
[PER Hakobian  ] acknowledged that the signature was that of [PER Sargsian  ] . 
In response to the presentation of the invoice for the transfer , [PER Hakobian  ] asked who from [LOC Armenia  ] signed the document . 
[PER Mahley  ] said that we did not have that information . 
[PER Eales  ] then explained that the financial document showed that the money for the deal came from an [MISC Iranian  ] front company through an [MISC Armenian  ] bank to [LOC Bulgaria  ] . 
POINTING THE FINGER AT [LOC BULGARIA  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Hakobian  ] made clear that the information was “clear” and “without doubt.” He assured [PER Mahley  ] that he would launch an investigation and that the [ORG GOAM  ] needed as much information as possible so that it could find the individuals responsible for the transfer . 
In response to the financial documents , [PER Hakobian  ] responded “so [LOC Bulgaria  ] sold these items to [LOC Armenia  ] knowing they were going to [LOC Iran  ] ? ” [PER Mahley  ] and [PER Eales  ] explained that the [MISC Bulgarians  ] were not aware of the involvement of an [MISC Iranian  ] in the transaction. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Hakobian  ] was also very concerned with how the goods were transferred to [LOC Armenia  ] . 
In reviewing the invoice , he noted that the goods were to be flown to [LOC Yerevan  ] airport and therefore there must be some documentation about this flight . 
[PER Hakobian  ] asked if the [LOC U.S.  ] knew whether all of the goods were provided to [LOC Iran  ] . 
He stated outright that he thought it was possible that the weapons were delivered to [LOC Armenia  ] , but some of them were subsequently diverted in a scheme to make money . 
[PER Hakobian  ] said he needed to understand what was reported to the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] . 
He was particularly interested in raising an issue about whether the entire shipment went to [LOC Iran  ] , or whether officials skimmed off part of the cargo . 
He noted that [LOC Armenia  ] has done a lot of work since 1991 to prevent [LOC Iran  ] from turning [LOC Armenia  ] into a conduit for [MISC Russian  ] arms transfers to [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Mahley  ] responded that it was the [LOC U.S.  ] assessment that the documents clearly show a deal between the [MISC Armenian  ] entity [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [LOC Iran  ] . 
There is no indication that the [MISC Bulgarian  ] entities were aware of [MISC Iranian  ] involvement ; it is our assessment that this deal was done to hide the [MISC Iranian  ] involvement from [MISC Bulgarian  ] and any other non-Armenian sources . 
With regard to the issue of whether any of the goods were kept in [LOC Armenia  ] , it was the [LOC U.S.  ] assessment that the payment process showed the [MISC Iranian  ] entity paid for the entire amount being acquired and that it knew the quantities it was paying to acquire . 
We have no shipping documentation from [LOC Armenia  ] to [LOC Iran  ] . 
[LOC U.S.  ] LAWS AND GOALS ------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Leaving aside [LOC Armenia  ] , s intention to investigate , [PER Mahley  ] reviewed with [PER Hakobian  ] what the goals of the [LOC U.S.  ] were for this situation . 
First , the transfer is impossible to reverse . 
Therefore , it is critical for the [LOC U.S.  ] to have full confidence that [ORG GOAM  ] cannot let this happen again . 
Second , this incident triggered two [LOC U.S.  ] laws that could result in sanctions . 
[PER Mahley  ] emphasized that [MISC Armenian  ] cooperation in this matter would be an important factor in our decision whether to waive sanctions. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) After the presentation of the additional information on this case , [PER Hakobian  ] appeared to understand the consequences of this activity and there is potential for significant damage to [LOC Armenia  ] . 
He said [LOC Armenia  ] has a lot of problems and there is no desire to create more problems . 
[PER Hakobian  ] committed to use all available resources of the [ORG GOAM  ] to fully investigate this transfer and share an official report with the [ORG USG  ] . 
MEETING WITH PRESIDENT [PER SARGSIAN  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Later in the afternoon , President [PER Sargsian  ] received Ambassador [PER Mahley  ] . 
[PER Sargsian  ] opened the meeting by noting that building relations with the [LOC United States  ] is of vital interest to [LOC Armenia  ] and that security is an important component in the overall bilateral relationship . 
He said that he , personally , was proud of his contributions in this respect and recalled that he had signed the [ORG Cooperative Threat Reduction Agreement  ] with [ORG DOD  ] . 
[PER Sargsian  ] indicated that he had been briefed by the [ORG NSS  ] on Mahley’s earlier meeting and invited Ambassador [PER Mahley  ] to begin. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Mahley  ] noted the earlier constructive meeting with the [ORG NSS  ] and said that he would like to brief the President directly on the export control case and how it came about . 
Following Mahley’s abbreviated presentation , the President stated there was such a contract with the [MISC Bulgarians  ] and that he had signed the end user certificate in his capacity as Minister of Defense . 
He listened intently as Ambassador [PER Mahley  ] passed the three documents ( invoice , end user document , and financial transaction statement ) and nodded as he reviewed the documents. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Ambassador [PER Mahley  ] clarified that the information we were sharing was obtained by the [ORG USG  ] using its own sources and methods . 
Earlier Chairman [PER Hakobian  ] had asked whether he could approach the [MISC Bulgarians  ] ; if he did so , it was possible that the [MISC Bulgarians  ] would be unaware of the case , [PER Mahley  ] indicated. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Ambassador [PER Mahley  ] stated that the reason the team of experts is in [LOC Armenia  ] is that the [ORG Administration  ] wants to move forward to find a constructive resolution to the issue , and he was sure that the next [ORG Administration  ] would be interested in doing so as well . 
Ambassador [PER Mahley  ] reviewed why the transaction was of such concern to the [LOC U.S.  ] and stated that [LOC U.S.  ] law requires us to sanction the entities of a country that facilitated such a transfer . 
While sanctions are mandatory , the President has the ability to waive sanctions on national security grounds . 
If [LOC Armenia  ] makes the necessary changes to strengthen its export control system , there might no longer be a need to impose sanctions . 
This was what Deputy Secretary [PER Negroponte  ] conveyed in his letter to [PER Sargsian  ] . 
[ORG GOAM  ] READY TO DISCUSS [ORG MOU  ] ------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Mahley  ] indicated that he was ready to discuss with the [ORG GOAM  ] a proposed Memorandum of Understanding ( [ORG MOU  ] ) with [ORG GOAM  ] experts , which the [LOC U.S.  ] believes would allow a constructive way forward for the two countries . 
Many of the items [LOC Armenia  ] has already accomplished , he stated . 
There are additional items that the [ORG MOU  ] covers , including process and transparency , that still need to be implemented in the export control regime and that the [ORG MOU  ] would cover . 
The [ORG USG  ] sees the signing of an [ORG MOU  ] “even without the particular export control case that triggered this discussion” to be a constructive step in the bilateral relationship , [PER Mahley  ] concluded. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Mahley  ] shared that he had briefed [ORG Congress  ] and that there was considerable interest in the case since the weapons had led to the death and injury of [LOC U.S.  ] servicemembers in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[PER Mahley  ] added that the [ORG USG  ] understands the sensitivity of this case and so worked hard to ensure that all the facts provided the [ORG GOAM  ] were correct and in order ; this took some time which delayed the briefing for the [MISC President.  ] <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) President [PER Sargsian  ] responded that he had understood two things from previous conversations on this subject: 1 ) information-sharing would precede any prescriptive measures that the [LOC U.S.  ] would suggest , but perhaps he had misunderstood this ; and 2 ) the weapons in question were missiles or rockets -- not RPGs . 
He stated that the information about the contract with [LOC Bulgaria  ] is correct and the [ORG GOAM  ] needs to explore further how the weapons got to [LOC Iran  ] or [LOC Iraq.  ] “We know that we got the weapons . 
We will figure out how they were transferred and we will let you know , ” the President assured [ORG Mahley.  ] <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) President [PER Sargsian  ] said the [ORG GOAM  ] wants to cooperate with the [LOC U.S.  ] on export control and will examine the [ORG MOU  ] . 
He said he had certain questions , and the [ORG NSS  ] would take the lead in working with Ambassador [PER Mahley  ] and the experts group the following day . 
The President concluded that the [ORG GOAM  ] did not have and had no interest in cooperating with [LOC Iran  ] on weapons sales . 
[ORG I.C.-CLEARED TALKING  ] POINTS DELIVERED TO [ORG GOAM  ] ------------------------------------------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG S/REL  ] [LOC ARMENIA  ] ) -- Between April 2006 and June 2008 , Coalition forces in [LOC Iraq  ] recovered multiple [MISC RPG-22  ] antitank weapons and [ORG PKM  ] machine guns . 
-- These weapons bore [MISC Bulgarian  ] factory markings and were tracked through a sales arrangement that took the weapons through [LOC Armenia  ] to [LOC Iran  ] . 
-- We have information that in early January 2003 the [MISC Bulgarian  ] firm [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and the [MISC Armenian  ] [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] ( [ORG MOD  ] ) completed a weapons sale that included these weapons recovered by Coalition forces in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The [MISC Armenian  ] company [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] served as intermediary for the deal . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX-- According to the end-user certificate and sales invoice , the deal included 1000 [MISC RPG-22s  ] produced by the [MISC Bulgarian  ] firm [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and 260 [ORG PKM  ] machine guns produced by the [MISC Bulgarian  ] firm [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
We have obtained documentation that includes production lot numbers for the [MISC RPG-22Ms  ] and the serial numbers for the [ORG PKM  ] machine guns sold to [LOC Armenia  ] . 
The [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] invoice was signed by [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
The end-user certificate was signed by former [MISC Armenian  ] Minister of [LOC Defense  ] ( now President ) [PER Serzh Sargsian  ] , which offered the Government of [LOC Armenia  ] , s assurance that the weapons would remain within the possession of the [MISC Armenian  ] Government . 
-- Financial records for the [MISC RPG-22  ] and [ORG PKM  ] sale identify the ordering customer as [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , someone known by the [LOC U.S.  ] to be associated with [MISC Iranian  ] arms acquisitions . 
-- An [MISC RPG-22  ] attack on a [LOC US  ] armored vehicle in [LOC Iraq  ] on January 31 , 2008 killed one [LOC US  ] soldier and wounded three . 
Factory markings on the recovered [MISC RPG-22  ] rocket debris indicate it was originally part of the shipment to [LOC Armenia  ] by the [MISC Bulgarian  ] firm [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
-- [LOC US  ] military personnel discovered an arms cache in [LOC Baghdad  ] on February 15 , 2008 that belonged to [ORG Hizballah Brigades  ] -- an Iranian-backed [MISC Iraqi  ] militant group . 
Among the weapons recovered , most of which were [MISC Iranian  ] in origin , were six [MISC Bulgarian  ] [MISC RPG-22  ] anti-tank weapons . 
The production lot and serial numbers on all six indicated they were produced by the [MISC Bulgarian  ] firm [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and part of the sale to [LOC Armenia  ] in January <a id='par2003' href='#par2003'>¶</a>2003 . 
-- Two [MISC RPG-22  ] launch tubes were recovered following an attack that wounded three [LOC US  ] military personnel in [LOC Baghdad  ] in mid- March 2008 . 
The lot and serial numbers on the recovered tubes matched those originally sold to [LOC Armenia  ] in January . 
Handwritten on both launchers was the [MISC Arabic  ] message “Rejoice - [MISC Islamic Resistance of Iraq  ] - [ORG Hizballah  ] Brigades” -- the name of the same Iranian-backed [MISC Iraqi  ] militant group .
