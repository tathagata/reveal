( C ) Summary: Embassy [LOC Berlin  ] warmly welcomes you to [LOC Germany  ] for the historic 20th Anniversary of the Fall of the [LOC Berlin  ] Wall . 
[LOC Berlin  ] is hosting all four-powers and [ORG EU  ] leaders at [LOC Berlin  ] 's [LOC Brandenburg Gate  ] to mark this occasion . 
Your visit includes meetings with Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] and Foreign Minister [PER Westerwelle  ] . 
Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] will likely raise concern about General Motors' November 3 decision to keep its [MISC German  ] subsidiary , [ORG Opel  ] , and [PER Westerwelle  ] may likely raise his interest in removal of nuclear weapons from [LOC Germany  ] . 
You may wish to encourage from them: -- Assurances that the proposed [LOC Afghanistan  ] conference will not slip past January and that [LOC Germany  ] will go immediately to the [ORG Bundestag  ] if increases in contributions are warranted ; -- Support for including banking and insurance relations with [LOC Iran  ] in calculations for possible new sanctions , and no backsliding on export controls ; -- Assurances that [LOC Germany  ] and the [ORG EU  ] will work with the [LOC U.S.  ] at [LOC Copenhagen  ] and not seek to isolate ; -- Agreement to tone down the public rhetoric on [ORG Opel  ] ; -- [MISC German  ] prodding of [LOC Russia  ] to engage constructively on security issues and human rights . 
Recognizing [LOC Germany  ] 's prominent and international role on this occasion is important to [PER Merkel  ] . 
She is still trying to get a sense of working with the new [ORG Washington Administration  ] and seems uncertain at times . 
Of course , [PER Westerwelle  ] is learning the ropes and being watched by [PER Merkel  ] to see if he can be an effective FM for her . 
Alternatively , [PER Merkel  ] may look to new Defense Minister [PER zu Guttenberg  ] ( [ORG CSU  ] ) to play an alternative role on foreign policy . 
End summary . 
Political Climate ----------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The political divisions that marked the recent election campaign , culminating in the October 28 swearing-in of a center-right coalition led by Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] , will be swept aside for your celebratory visit . 
[PER Merkel  ] just returned from what she considers an exceptional visit to [LOC Washington  ] , which front-paged her address to [ORG Congress  ] in every publication . 
[PER Merkel  ] will be focused on setting her priorities for the next legislative term -- she gives a major state of the union-like address on November 10 on all issues -- and will seek [LOC U.S.  ] cooperation in promoting economic recovery and growth ( [ORG Opel  ] , regulation ) , progress in addressing climate change ( [LOC Copenhagen  ] ) , and strengthening [LOC Germany  ] 's international profile ( [LOC Afghanistan  ] ) . 
[PER Westerwelle  ] will have spent a total of some two days work in the foreign ministry by the time your arrive . 
His ministry is not sure what he wants yet . 
Economic Climate ---------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [LOC Germany  ] 's export-driven economy is showing initial signs of recovery from its deepest recession since [ORG WW II  ] . 
For the full year 2009 , GDP will shrink around 5% , but should show modest growth of 1% next year . 
Unemployment has remained relatively low thanks to government-subsidized programs , but is expected to rise next year . 
Given the government 's record budget deficit , there is heated debate over the wisdom of the new coalition 's proposed tax cuts , intended to boost growth . 
[LOC Germany  ] was pleased with the outcome of the [LOC G-20 Summit  ] in [LOC Pittsburgh  ] , but is keener on the [MISC G-20  ] 's regulatory agenda than addressing global imbalances. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG GM  ] 's sudden decision on November 3 to cancel the sale of its [MISC European  ] subsidiary [ORG Opel  ] in a deal underwritten by the [MISC German  ] government shocked and angered [MISC Germans  ] . 
[PER Merkel  ] 's chief economic advisor told the Ambassador November 4 that [PER Merkel  ] was so furious at [ORG GM  ] 's about-face that she refused to take a call from [ORG GM  ] CEO [PER Fritz Henderson  ] . 
[PER Merkel  ] subsequently called the President . 
Federal and state governments are demanding that [ORG GM  ] immediately pay back 1.2 billion [PER Euros  ] in bridge loans they had extended to the car maker . 
What particularly irked the [MISC Germans  ] was that [ORG GM  ] had failed to forewarn them of their latest flip-flop after months of laborious negotiations and a total of 4.5 billion [PER Euros  ] in loans/guarantees in exchange for promises to retain most [ORG Opel  ] jobs and plants in [LOC Germany  ] . 
( [PER Merkel  ] found out about the [ORG GM  ] decision just hours after delivering her address before [ORG Congress  ] . 
) The [ORG Opel  ] story has dominated the news November 4-5 . 
[ORG Opel  ] workers are likely to strike in the next few days , and politicians and others are citing the [ORG GM  ] action as another example of [MISC American  ] " turbo-capitalism . 
" [LOC Berlin  ] 00001403 002 of 003 [ORG Iran/Export Controls  ] ----------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) You should express appreciation for [PER Merkel  ] 's strong statement during her speech to [ORG Congress  ] that there should be " zero tolerance " for [MISC Iranian  ] acquisition of weapons of mass destruction . 
You should stress the importance of [MISC German  ] support for [ORG EU  ] measures or measures taken by " like-minded " countries should a [ORG UNSCR  ] be unattainable due to a possible [MISC Iranian  ] rejection of the engagement track . 
With [PER Westerwelle  ] , it remains imperative that you raise the importance of P5 1 unity again . 
In addition , you should stress the particular importance of continued [MISC German  ] leadership on export control , particularly in light of recent interdictions of [MISC Iranian  ] arms shipments . 
The new [MISC German  ] coalition seeks to expand exports by normalizing [MISC German  ] export control policy ( of arms and dual-use items ) with the [ORG EU  ] . 
[LOC Germany  ] contends that its intention is to raise the [ORG EU  ] to the [MISC German  ] standard , but the danger is that [MISC German  ] standards could be watered down to an [ORG EU  ] lowest common denominator . 
Arms Control/Disarmament ------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Westerwelle  ] is on a bit of a tangent by publicly calling for removal of nuclear weapons from [LOC Germany  ] , although he insists that [LOC Berlin  ] will not act unilaterally . 
This gets him attention and he then offers assurances that everything must be done in the [ORG NATO  ] context , but it distracts from other issues . 
This is one of the few foreign policy positions that distinguishes his [ORG FDP  ] from Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] 's [ORG CDU  ] , and [PER Westerwelle  ] may feel pressed to mention this . 
The [ORG MFA  ] emphasizes that [PER Westerwelle  ] 's position does not necessarily mean that [LOC Germany  ] intends to cease participation in the [ORG NATO  ] nuclear share . 
[LOC Germany  ] may be willing to maintain its fleet of dual-capable aircraft , but have the applicable nuclear weapons stored in the [LOC U.S.  ] or elsewhere . 
[PER Westerwelle  ] also understands that some Allies may want to maintain their current stock of [ORG NATO  ] nuclear weapons . 
Your meeting with [PER Westerwelle  ] is a good opportunity to emphasize any red lines or concerns we have before this effort gets too far down the road . 
For its part , the [LOC Chancellery  ] , [ORG MFA  ] and [ORG MOD  ] are uncomfortable with [PER Westerwelle  ] 's push and sees no reason to tackle this issue right now . 
[ORG Afghanistan: Small Window  ] for More Troops ----------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) FM [PER Westerwelle  ] has strongly defended [MISC German  ] engagement in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , both military and civilian , as vital to [MISC German  ] national security interests . 
However , he supports the Chancellor 's recent decision to put off any consideration of deploying additional [MISC German  ] soldiers until after the proposed international conference on [LOC Afghanistan  ] early next year , notwithstanding the significantly deteriorated security situation in the north . 
The new government sees the conference as critical for setting a new framework and benchmarks for the international engagement in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , as well as for prescribing what is expected of the [MISC Afghan  ] government in return . 
It is in our interest to capitalize on the [MISC Germans'  ] sense of " ownership " of the north in getting a commitment from [PER Westerwelle  ] to seriously re-consider a troop increase after the [LOC Afghanistan  ] conference early next year , if , in fact , he and [PER Merkel  ] rule out any increase before then . 
Within this context , it would be important to acknowledge that [LOC Germany  ] is the fourth largest provider of civilian development assistance in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and is an enthusiastic supporter of the [LOC U.S.  ] Focused [ORG District Development  ] ( [ORG FDD  ] ) civilian police training program , which it joined in January of this year . 
[LOC Middle East  ] ----------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) You should thank [PER Merkel  ] for her strong statements before [ORG Congress  ] where she stressed the overarching importance of [LOC Israel  ] 's security and a two-state solution . 
In general , [PER Merkel  ] has been very supportive of [LOC U.S.  ] efforts in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
She is now planning the second round of [MISC German-Israeli  ] government consultations , likely before the end of the year . 
She may raise this with you and seek your advice on messages to [PER Netanyahu  ] . 
We understand that [PER Westerwelle  ] may also be planning to visit [LOC Israel  ] . 
The [ORG MFA  ] said that [PER Westerwelle  ] may seek a greater [MISC German  ] role to promote peace , for example to offer [MISC German  ] support in coordinating [LOC Middle East  ] policy with the [ORG EU  ] . 
According to the [ORG MFA  ] , [PER Westerwelle  ] may also raise the concept of creating some type of [MISC OSCE-like  ] security structure [LOC BERLIN  ] 00001403 003 of 003 for the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
Reluctance with Overseas Deployments ------------------------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [LOC Germany  ] continues to wrestle with the issue of overseas deployments . 
[PER Westerwelle  ] , and the [ORG FDP  ] in general , tend to be more skeptical than [PER Merkel  ] 's [ORG CDU  ] on this topic and this is reflected in the government coalition agreement . 
The coalition agreement calls for a " gradual reduction " of [MISC German  ] participation in [LOC UNIFIL  ] " with the perspective of bringing it to an end . 
" Similarly , the agreement calls for a " critical review " of the " multitude " of parliamentary mandates for the Bundeswehr to participate in counterterrorism and piracy operations off the [LOC Horn of Africa  ] , again with a view toward reducing them . 
It would be helpful for you to emphasize how important we view [LOC Germany  ] 's contributions to these international operations . 
Russia/Energy Security ---------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) We expect [LOC Germany  ] to be less forgiving of [MISC Russian  ] bullying of its eastern [MISC European  ] neighbors through cut-offs of natural gas supplies , especially given the departure of former Foreign Minister [PER Steinmeier  ] -- known for his relatively pro-Russian views . 
Still , we expect [LOC Germany  ] to continue to place a heavy emphasis on maintaining good relations with [LOC Russia  ] , believing that constructive engagement and assistance with modernization are the best way to deal with this difficult " strategic partner . 
" [LOC Germany  ] is [LOC Europe  ] 's largest energy user and is highly dependent on [LOC Russia  ] for energy supplies , but [LOC Berlin  ] does not view this as a vulnerability , believing that [LOC Moscow  ] is equally dependent on [LOC Germany  ] as a consumer . 
[LOC Germany  ] nevertheless recognizes that it must diversify its sources of supply , routes , and means of energy generation to gain greater energy security . 
Climate Change -------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) As the Chancellor 's remarks underline , [MISC German  ] officials want strong [LOC U.S.  ] leadership going into the [LOC Copenhagen Summit  ] . 
They are advocating for a unified [MISC US/EU  ] position towards the major emerging economies , particularly [LOC China  ] and [LOC India  ] , to urge them to commit to ambitious national actions at [LOC Copenhagen  ] . 
They are looking for signals of our commitment to domestic and international actions that will allow us to collectively meet science-based targets . 
[MISC German  ] leaders recognize the challenge of passing climate change legislation in the [LOC U.S.  ] and have lowered their expectations for the possibility of reaching a legally binding agreement next month at [LOC Copenhagen  ] . 
They have begun to describe the [ORG Summit  ] as one step in a larger process -- a politically binding framework -- and may be preparing the [MISC German  ] public for a less ambitious outcome . 
[LOC Mission Germany  ] --------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Madam Secretary , the [LOC U.S.  ] government presence in [LOC Germany  ] currently numbers 744 US direct-hire ( [ORG USDH  ] ) employees , 683 locally engaged ( [ORG LE  ] ) staff , and 951 [ORG USG  ] EFMs and a State operating budget of $153 million annually . 
This includes a [LOC Frankfurt  ] cohort of over 500 [ORG USDH  ] employees whose responsibilities support [ORG USG  ] operations globally . 
[LOC Berlin  ] 's [ORG USG  ] presence -- over 500 [ORG USDHs  ] and [ORG LE  ] staff -- is centered in the new Chancery next to the [LOC Brandenburg Gate  ] . 
The [ORG LE  ] staff includes many employees who have worked for the [ORG USG  ] for over 30 years . 
[LOC Mission Germany  ] is on the cutting edge of using IT solutions xxxxx .
