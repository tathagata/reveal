( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: Morocco’s largest conglomerate , the palace-controlled [ORG ONA  ] , dismissed its CEO on April 11 , charging that he mismanaged [PER Wana  ] , the company’s telecommunications subsidiary . 
The abrupt nature of the dismissal has been the talk of [LOC Casablanca  ] business circles for the past week , and has refocused attention on the king’s business activities . 
While the timing and manner of [MISC Bendidi’s  ] dismissal were unexpected , business contacts in [LOC Casablanca  ] did not find it unusual , noting historically high turnover in [MISC ONA’s  ] executive suite . 
End Summary. ------------- [ORG ONA  ] FIRES CEO ------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Omnium nord-africain ( [ORG ONA  ] ) , Morocco’s largest conglomerate , announced on April 11 that it had dismissed CEO [PER Saad Bendidi  ] for mismanaging [PER Wana  ] , the company’s telecommunications subsidiary . 
[PER Bendidi  ] had been the CEO of palace-controlled [ORG ONA  ] since February 2005 . 
[PER Mouatassim Belghazi  ] , an ex-civil servant and head of the [ORG Morocco-Emirates Development Company  ] ( [ORG SOMED  ] ) , an [ORG ONA  ] affiliate , was named to replace him within hours , prompting speculation that the dismissal was premeditated , despite [MISC ONA’s  ] protestations to the contrary. ------------------------------ WHY DID BENDIDI GET THE BOOT ? ------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) According to the unusually frank statement released by [ORG ONA’s Board of Directors  ] , the company decided to fire [PER Bendidi  ] after 2007 results suggested that he had failed to develop [PER Wana  ] adequately . 
Board members took issue with the ex-CEO’s plan to infuse the telecommunications venture with an additional five billion dirham ( USD 688 million ) investment , and blamed him for “serious management failings in planning and strategic direction of the enterprise.” [ORG ONA  ] reported that operating profits fell 29 percent as a result of [LOC Wana’s  ] steep start-up costs . 
While [PER Wana  ] is only the third largest telecommunications provider in [LOC Morocco  ] , behind [MISC French  ] [ORG Vivendi-controlled Maroc Telecom  ] and the [MISC Spanish-Portuguese  ] company [ORG Meditel  ] , [ORG ONA  ] feels that the market has plenty of room for a successful third player. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) Reports in Morocco’s leading business paper , “La [PER Vie Eco”  ] on April 18 , suggest that [MISC Bendidi’s  ] fate was sealed not so much by [LOC Wana’s  ] poor results , as by the view of [MISC ONA’s  ] powerful board of directors that he had failed to adapt the company’s strategy in the face of the shortfall . 
In background interviews , company officials noted that slippage from [LOC Wana’s  ] business plan was evident as early as October 2007 , but that [PER Bendidi  ] failed to react , even after the [ORG ONA  ] board engaged four separate sets of consultants to propose possible alternatives . 
[MISC Bendidi’s  ] critics have alleged similar passivity in addressing poor performance in other divisions , including the [LOC Acima  ] supermarket chain . 
A number of our contacts thus see little reason to doubt that [PER Wana  ] was at the root of [MISC Bendidi’s  ] dismissal. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Other contacts caution against taking [MISC ONA’s  ] harsh public statements at face value , however . 
They note that the company’s fixed and mobile phone services have been on offer just over a year , barely enough time to evaluate its potential , and that additional investment is frequently required when companies seek to break into new fields . 
They add that [ORG ONA  ] posted strong earnings in 2007 , due in part to strong banking results and the sale of a stake in an insurance company . 
At the end of March , net income had risen from 959 million dirham a year earlier to 1.7 billion . 
[ORG ONA  ] stock has risen 19 percent in 2008. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Given such results , many believe there must be more to the story of [MISC Bendidi’s  ] dismissal . 
Some viewed the fact that he was not given the chance to politely bow out , but was publicly fired , as further evidence that something more than poor performance was at play . 
One individual , for example , ascribed the shift to a desire to give a chance to the much-touted [PER Belghazi  ] , suggesting that poor [PER Wana  ] results offered a convenient pretext for change . 
Others speculated that a personality clash between [PER Bendidi  ] and [PER Mounir Mahjidi  ] , the [MISC King’s  ] special secretary , may have played a role. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Despite the intrigue surrounding [MISC Bendidi’s  ] firing , members of the business community in [LOC Casablanca  ] did not find it particularly unusual . 
A long-time franchise-holder pointed out that [MISC Bendidi’s  ] predecessor , [PER Bassim Jai Hokaimi  ] , also did not last more than a few years at [MISC ONA’s  ] helm . 
A piece in the [MISC French-language  ] weekly [ORG Maroc Hebdo  ] called [PER Belghazi  ] the newest initiate to the “ejector seat , ” reinforcing the perception that the top job at [ORG ONA  ] is a risky proposition . 
As one businessperson put it , the palace can be very demanding . 
When the palace calls , “if you don’t pick up the phone on the first ring , you’re in trouble , ” she said. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [MISC Comment: Whatever  ] the true story , the manner in which [MISC Bendidi’s  ] departure was handled has not shown [ORG ONA  ] in the best light . 
As more than one commentator has noted , the flood of recriminations that have accompanied the firing offers a rich vein for [LOC Wana’s  ] competitors to mine in months to come . 
The contretemps has led some to raise broader issues as well , however. “Le Journal’s” lead editorial seized on the dispute to renew the publication’s longstanding call on the king to exit the business world , citing the inherent conflict between his role as ultimate arbiter of the [MISC Moroccan  ] system and leading businessman and banker within it . 
[MISC ONA’s  ] “incredible communiqu , ” the journal wrote , not only “shattered” the credibility of the group , but also “cast doubt on the transparency of the king’s business affairs , ” an “explosive situation” at a time when [MISC Moroccans  ] face rising prices for goods whose production and distribution is often assured by the king’s own companies . 
These issues too have long sparked hushed debate in [MISC Moroccan  ] business circles , but few expect the royal role in [ORG ONA  ] to change anytime soon .
