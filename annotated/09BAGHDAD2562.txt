<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 [LOC BAGHDAD  ] 002562 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 08/18/2019 TAGS PGOV , PREL , IZ SUBJECT: THE GREAT GAME , IN MESOPOTAMIA: [LOC IRAQ  ] AND ITS NEIGHBORS , PART I Classified By: Ambassador [PER Christopher R. Hill  ] , for reasons 1.4 b and d. <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) This is the first of two cables reviewing [ORG Iraq’s  ] relations with key neighboring states , including [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , [LOC Kuwait  ] , [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Turkey  ] , in the wake of the August 19 bombings . 
Part II reviews [ORG Iraq’s  ] relations with [LOC Syria  ] , in the wake of the August 19 bombings. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Summary: [ORG Iraq’s  ] relations with its neighbors represent a critical element in its efforts to maintain security and stability and normalize its position in the [LOC Gulf  ] and the broader region . 
While [LOC Iraq  ] made substantial progress in 2008-09 on these fronts , there remained unfinished business , especially in terms of relations with [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , [LOC Kuwait  ] , and [LOC Syria  ] . 
The August 19 bombings -- targeting the [ORG MFA  ] , and by extension [ORG Iraq’s  ] improving relations with its neighbors -- represent a serious setback to that progress and have alarmed senior [MISC Iraqi  ] officials that [MISC Iraqi  ] [PER Sunni Arab  ] neighbors in particular now view those earlier gains as “reversible.” [LOC Iraq  ] views relations with [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] as among its most challenging , given Riyadh’s money , deeply ingrained anti-Shia attitudes , and suspicions that a [MISC Shia-led  ] [LOC Iraq  ] will inevitably further [MISC Iranian  ] regional influence . 
[MISC Iraqi  ] contacts assess that the [MISC Saudi  ] goal ( and that of most other [PER Sunni Arab  ] states , to vary degrees ) is to enhance [MISC Sunni  ] influence , dilute [PER Shia  ] dominance and promote the formation of a weak and fractured [MISC Iraqi  ] government . 
Coincidentally , [MISC Iranian  ] efforts are driven by a clear determination to see a sectarian , [MISC Shia-dominated  ] government that is weak , disenfranchised from its [MISC Arab  ] neighbors , detached from the [LOC U.S.  ] security apparatus and strategically dependent on [LOC Iran  ] . 
Neither of these objectives is in the [LOC U.S.  ] interest . 
In the longer term , we will need to flesh out ideas for a post-GCC security architecture that includes [LOC Iraq  ] more fully , develops ways to contain [MISC Iranian  ] regional influence , and shapes the special position [LOC Iraq  ] will likely occupy in the [LOC Gulf  ] in ways that further our interests and those of our [LOC Gulf  ] partners . 
End Summary . 
[MISC SAUDI  ] [LOC ARABIA  ] -- ANTI-SHIISM AS FOREIGN POLICY ? --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [MISC Iraqi  ] officials view relations with [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] as among their most problematic , although they are usually careful with [LOC U.S.  ] officials to avoid overly harsh criticism , given our close relations with the [MISC Saudis  ] . 
[MISC Iraqi  ] officials note that periodic anti-Shia outbursts from [MISC Saudi  ] religious figures are often allowed to circulate without sanction or disavowal from the [MISC Saudi  ] leadership . 
This reality reinforces the [MISC Iraqi  ] view that the [MISC Saudi  ] state religion of [PER Wahabbi Sunni Islam  ] condones religious incitement against [PER Shia  ] . 
The suspicion is that these anti-Shia attitudes color [MISC Saudi  ] views of a [MISC Shia-led  ] [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The [MISC Saudis  ] have traditionally viewed [LOC Iraq  ] as a [MISC Sunni-dominated  ] bulwark against the spread of [ORG Shiism  ] and [MISC Iranian  ] political influence . 
In the wake of bombings in predominantly [PER Shia  ] areas across the country in June 2009 that killed dozens , PM [PER Maliki  ] pointed publicly to one such statement , made by a [MISC Saudi  ] imam in May , and noted , “We have observed that many governments have been suspiciously silent on the fatwa provoking the killing of [LOC Shiites.”  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) For now the [MISC Saudis  ] are using their money and media power [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] to support [MISC Sunni  ] political aspirations , exert influence over [MISC Sunni  ] tribal groups , and undercut the [MISC Shia-led Islamic Supreme Council  ] of [LOC Iraq  ] ( [ORG ISCI  ] ) and [ORG Iraqi National Alliance  ] ( [ORG INA  ] ) . 
[ORG NSC  ] advisor [ORG QIraq  ] ( [ORG ISCI  ] ) and [ORG Iraqi National Alliance  ] ( [ORG INA  ] ) . 
[ORG NSC  ] advisor [ORG Safa  ] al-Sheikh told us recently that [MISC Saudi  ] influence in [LOC Iraq  ] was significant , perhaps more significant than [MISC Iran’s  ] at the moment , given the financial and media assets at its disposal , and given [MISC Iran’s  ] recent internal distractions . 
He described the [MISC Saudi  ] “media message” as having shifted a few years ago from one that was hostile to the [ORG GOI  ] and sympathetic to the insurgency , to one that focused now more on an anti-ISCI message . 
According to PM Advisor Sadiq al-Rikabi , the [MISC Saudis  ] are opposed to a strong [MISC Shia-led  ] [ORG INA  ] . 
Al-Sheikh also assessed that the [MISC Saudis  ] would try to curb [ORG ISCI  ] and [ORG INA  ] and throw support to [MISC Sunni  ] groups to counter [MISC Iranian  ] influence , steps that could end up indirectly supporting [PER Maliki  ] , if he continues to pursue a cross-sectarian coalition in the elections . 
These contacts assess that the [MISC Saudi  ] goal ( and to varying degrees most other [MISC Sunni  ] states ) is to enhance [MISC Sunni  ] influence , dilute [PER Shia  ] dominance , and promote the formation of a weak and more fractured [MISC Iraqi  ] government . 
( COMMENT: Coincidentally , [LOC Iran  ] also sees as in its interest a weak [MISC Iraqi  ] government , albeit one with [PER Shia  ] firmly in control . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Some observers see a more malign [MISC Saudi  ] influence . 
A recent [MISC Iraqi  ] press article quoted anonymous [MISC Iraqi  ] intelligence sources assessing that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] was leading a [LOC Gulf  ] effort to destabilize the [PER Maliki  ] government and was [LOC BAGHDAD  ] 00002562 002 OF 003 financing “the current al [MISC Qaida  ] offensive in [LOC Iraq.”  ] The article also quoted MP [PER Haidar  ] al-Abadi , a [PER Maliki  ] political ally , insisting that [ORG Gulf Arab  ] neighbors wanted to destabilize [LOC Iraq  ] . 
A few of our more senior contacts hint at similar malign intentions “by some neighbors , ” making clear without being explicit that they are referring to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
KUWAIT: RELATIONS HOSTAGE TO CHAPTER VII CONCERNS --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Although [LOC Kuwait  ] re-opened its Embassy and sent an ambassador in 2008 , bilateral relations remain hostage to Chapter VII concerns . 
While the [MISC Kuwaitis  ] have indicated some willingness to reduce significantly the amount of compensation [LOC Iraq  ] is paying under [ORG UNSCR  ] 687 , they have insisted in return on [ORG GOI  ] re-affirmation in its entirety of [ORG UNSCR  ] 833 , entailing acceptance of the land borders and maritime boundary between the two countries . 
The latter in particular is highly problematic for the [MISC Iraqi  ] leadership , especially in an election year , according to senior contacts . 
At present , [LOC Iraq  ] has unimpeded navigational access from the [LOC Gulf  ] to the port of [LOC Um Qasr  ] , but some two-thirds of the deep water channel of the [PER Khor Abdullah  ] now lies -- as a result of the 833 demarcation -- in [MISC Kuwaiti  ] territorial waters . 
Some observers , such as [ORG Da’wa Party  ] MP [ORG Sami  ] al-Askari , have expressed concern to us that after [LOC U.S.  ] forces withdraw fully , [LOC Kuwait  ] will try to control [ORG Iraq’s  ] access to the sea , “and that border demarcation will allow it.” In his view , “No [MISC Iraqi  ] leader could ever formally recognize the maritime border.” Even PM [PER Maliki  ] believes this . 
Despite these difficulties , the [MISC Iraqi  ] and [MISC Kuwaiti  ] sides have made significant progress cooperating in the past six months on [MISC Kuwaiti  ] missing persons and property . 
[ORG NSC  ] advisor al-Sheikh believes that the Chapter VII issues with [LOC Kuwait  ] will eventually be resolved and that “we do not consider [LOC Kuwait  ] a problem country” like some of the other neighbors . 
Nevertheless , the border issue is an acute friction point and could , in the view of [PER Maliki  ] , become grounds for confrontation between the two . 
[MISC IRAN’S  ] LOOMING PRESENCE ----------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [MISC Iranian  ] influence in [LOC Iraq  ] remains pervasive , as [LOC Tehran  ] manipulates a range of levers to mold [ORG Iraq’s  ] political , religious , social , and economic landscape . 
Overall , however , the [ORG GOI  ] views its relations with [LOC Iran  ] in a special category , posing risks that are manageable and not viewed as existential threats to the state . 
Obviously many [MISC Sunni  ] contacts -- and many of our allies in the region -- see the situation in far starker terms and fear that [LOC Iraq  ] could fall into [MISC Iran’s  ] political orbit and rendered unable to speak or act independently , once [LOC U.S.  ] troops draw down . 
[MISC Iranian  ] efforts are driven by a clear determination to see a sectarian , [MISC Shia-dominated  ] government that is weak , disenfranchised from its [MISC Arab  ] neighbors , detached from the [LOC U.S.  ] security apparatus and strategically dependent on [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) While significantly weaker than the [MISC Saudis  ] and others on media , the [MISC Iranians  ] fund political parties and key individuals ( as other neighboring countries do ) , according to a range of well-informed [MISC Iraqi  ] contacts . 
[PER Shia  ] contacts like PM advisor Rikabi and [ORG NSC  ] advisor al-Sheikh , as well as others such as ( [MISC Kurdish  ] ) FM [ORG Zebari  ] , do not dismiss the significant [MISC Iranian  ] influence but instead argue that it: -- is best countered by [MISC Iraqi  ] [PER Shia  ] political actors , who know how to deal with [LOC Iran  ] ; -- is not aimed , unlike that of some [PER Sunni Arab  ] neighbors , at fomenting terrorism that would destabilize the government ; Qfomenting terrorism that would destabilize the government ; -- will naturally create nationalistic [MISC Iraqi  ] resistance to it ( both [PER Shia  ] and more broadly ) , if other outsiders do not intervene to stoke [MISC Sunni-Shia  ] sectarian tension ; and -- has been frozen in place to some extent in the past few months by the political turmoil inside [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) According to al-Sheikh , [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Iran  ] have “very special , very frank talks” in which [MISC Iraq’s Shia-led  ] government is able to push back effectively against [MISC Iranian  ] influence on some fronts . 
Observers generally credit the [MISC Iranians  ] with playing a more sophisticated game than the [MISC Syrians  ] , as they try to shape the political process to their liking . 
These contacts acknowledge that [LOC Iran  ] is providing some form of covert support to armed groups like the [ORG Promise Day Brigades  ] and other small groups , but maintain they have stopped support for the big militias . 
It should be noted that some contacts demonstrate discomfort when asked about [MISC Iranian  ] influence and show an alacrity for moving on to other [LOC BAGHDAD  ] 00002562 003 OF 003 neighbors in the region . 
TURKEY: BETTER THAN THE REST ---------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Relations with [LOC Turkey  ] are relatively positive . 
[LOC Turkey  ] intervened diplomatically to attempt to mediate the post-August 19 crisis with the [MISC Syrians  ] , and unlike the [MISC Iranian  ] effort , seems to have gotten some traction with the parties . 
The effort has been well-received here , even if concrete progress has been limited . 
The [MISC Iraqis  ] and [LOC Turks  ] have established a [ORG Strategic Commission  ] that meets periodically at the ministerial level , paving the way for head of state visits marking significant economic cooperation . 
PM Erdogan is expected in [LOC Baghdad  ] in October , following up on the ministerial in mid-September in [LOC Ankara  ] . 
Bilateral trade is currently at $7 billion annually , and the two countries hope it will expand significantly in the coming decade . 
Moreover , [LOC Turkey  ] has worked to improve its relations with the [ORG KRG  ] , and they have significantly increased their diplomatic and commercial presence in the [MISC Kurdish  ] areas . 
However , the [LOC Turks  ] also have been active on the [MISC Iraqi  ] political front , funding groups like the [MISC Mosul-based  ] [PER Sunni Al-Hudba  ] movement , in an effort to offset [MISC Kurd  ] influence in areas outside [LOC Kurdistan.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) It is the water issue that threatens to complicate an improving [MISC Iraq-Turkey  ] relationship . 
According to [MISC DFM Labid  ] Abbawi , [LOC Iraq  ] needs a flow of 700 cubic meters of water for its needs but could get back with a minimum of 500 . 
However , [LOC Turkey  ] was only allowing a flow of about 230 cubic meters ( with an uptick in August and September beyond that level ) . 
A recent visit to [LOC Turkey  ] by the [MISC Iraqi  ] Minister of Water was not very productive , he noted . 
THE WAY FORWARD --------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) It will help Iraq’s efforts to maintain stability and security , and to continue moving forward in normalization with neighbors , if we and the [MISC P-5  ] can provide the requisite support for the appointment by the [ORG UN  ] of a senior official ( someone other than SRSG head [PER Melkert  ] , who already has a full plate with UNAMI ) to look into the August 19 bombings . 
We should also weigh in with key neighbors to urge a redoubling of efforts in normalizing relations with [LOC Iraq  ] , keeping up the pressure on [LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] in particular to return their Ambassadors . 
We should also caution [ORG Iraq’s Arab  ] neighbors against efforts to inflame [MISC Shia-Sunni  ] anxieties through their support for [MISC Sunni  ] parties and by [MISC Shia-critical  ] media attacks . 
Regarding [LOC Kuwait  ] , we will need to work for steady progress on Chapter VII where possible , focusing on [MISC Oil-for-Food  ] and WMD resolutions 1546 and 707 , initially , with a push after elections to make progress on the [MISC Kuwait-related  ] resolutions. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) In the longer term , we will need to flesh out ideas for a post-GCC security architecture that includes [LOC Iraq  ] more fully , develops ways to contain [MISC Iranian  ] regional influence , and shapes the special position [LOC Iraq  ] will likely occupy in the [LOC Gulf  ] in ways that further our interests and those of our [LOC Gulf  ] partners . 
The challenge for us is to convince [LOC Iraq  ] neighbors , particularly the [PER Sunni Arab  ] governments , that relations with a new [LOC Iraq  ] are not a zero-sum game , where if [LOC Iraq  ] wins , they lose . 
We still have work to do to convince them that a strong , stable , democratic ( and inevitably [MISC Shia-led  ] ) [LOC Iraq  ] is the best guarantee that [LOC Iraq  ] will be able to shake [MISC Iranian  ] manipulation and see its future bound up with that of the [LOC West  ] and its moderate [MISC Arab  ] neighbors .
