Smith  ] for reasons 1.4 ( B ) and ( D ) SUMMARY: --------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) During an Oct. 20 courtesy call with the Ambassador , [MISC Pakistani  ] Ambassador [PER Umar Khan Alisherzai  ] highlighted the success of recent military operations in [MISC Pakistan’s  ] tribal areas ; lamented strains on the [MISC Saudi-Pakistani  ] bilateral relationship ; discussed other regional issues affecting [LOC Pakistan  ] ; and offered his advice on countering extremism in rural tribal regions . 
End Summary . 
WAZIRISTAN: “REASONABLE RESISTANCE , BUT NOT AS MUCH AS WE EXPECTED” ----------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Alisherzai  ] described the [MISC Pakistani  ] military operations in [LOC Waziristan  ] as “progressing well , ” adding that they had encountered “reasonable resistance , but not as much as we expected.” The army faced difficult terrain in the region , he continued , but had already killed over 100 militants . 
[PER Alisherzai  ] described the extremists as a group of “Chechens , [MISC Saudis  ] , [MISC Uzbeks  ] and others” who had come across the border from [LOC Afghanistan  ] and sought refuge with the local population . 
Although tribal tradition required the [MISC Pakistanis  ] to offer them shelter , he explained , “these people turned out to be monsters , ” and the local population turned against them . 
SWAT VALLEY: A SUCCESS STORY ? ----------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Alisherzai  ] pointed to the military’s advances against the [ORG Taliban  ] in the [LOC Swat Valley  ] as one example of success in the region . 
The cooperation of the local people was a decisive factor , as they provided the most effective intelligence to the military after realizing that “the militants were not interested in [LOC Islam  ] at all.” In addition , the military and police in [LOC Swat  ] provided weapons to local tribes . 
When pressed about conditions in [LOC Swat  ] , [PER Alisherzai  ] admitted that the [MISC Pakistani  ] military still faced challenges due to their limited resources . 
He said that 10,000 soldiers had been relocated from the [MISC Indian  ] border to [LOC Swat  ] and that 100,000 new soldiers were placed there as well . 
However , [PER Alisherzai  ] was quick to point out that the 100,000 new soldiers were inexperienced. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) While upbeat that [MISC Pakistan’s  ] military and civilian leaders were “truly working in tandem for the first time , ” [PER Alisherzai  ] was disappointed that action was not taken sooner. “All of this would have been easier if done under ( former [MISC Pakistani  ] President ) [PER Musharraf  ] , ” he concluded. “WE NEED MORE ARMS , AMMO AND PLANES” ------------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In response to the [MISC Ambassador’s  ] question about support from CentCom , [PER Alisherzai  ] replied that the [LOC U.S.  ] “does a lot for [MISC Pakistan.”  ] However , it was not enough to fight this problem . 
All of [ORG NATO  ] was fighting the battle in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , he complained , while [LOC Pakistan  ] alone was standing up to the extremists within its borders . 
For this reason he insisted that [LOC Pakistan  ] needed more material support from the [LOC U.S.  ] in the form of “arms , ammo and planes.” REBUILDING OLD RELATIONSHIPS ---------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) When asked about the [MISC Saudi-Pakistani  ] relationship , [PER Alisherzai  ] admitted that it had been strained since [MISC Pakistani  ] President [PER Asif Ali Zardari’s  ] election . 
[PER Alisherzai  ] blamed the problems on the [MISC Saudi  ] perception that [PER Zardari  ] was pro-Iranian and pro-Shia , which made them apprehensive about working with him. “We have been punished by [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] because our president talks to the [MISC Iranians  ] , ” [PER Alisherzai  ] lamented . 
He claimed that his access to [MISC Saudi  ] leadership was good , but that he would have to continue to work hard to rebuild [LOC Pakistan  ] , s relationship with the [ORG SAG  ] . 
[PER Alisherzai  ] opined RIYADH 00001415 002.2 OF 002 that the [MISC Saudis  ] were more concerned with their own internal problems than with the problems of [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[LOC IRAN  ] ---- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Alisherzai  ] accused [LOC Russia  ] of “fully supporting the [MISC Iranians’  ] nuclear program , ” adding that all [LOC Shia  ] communities in the region supported this program . 
He described [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear ambitions as a move to consolidate domestic political power and stated multiple times , “they will not leave this subject.” INDIA: “WE ARE NOT EXPECTING ANYTHING GOOD” ------------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Alisherzai  ] blamed [LOC India  ] for helping to train and fund extremist groups fighting against the Government of [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
He said that [LOC India  ] also helped support the [ORG Taliban  ] in [LOC Pakistan  ] , explaining “They ( [LOC India  ] ) will never let a chance to harm [LOC Pakistan  ] go.” [PER Alisherzai  ] summed up his feelings about [LOC India  ] by saying , “We are not expecting anything good from them.” THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM ----------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Asked how to stop terrorism and extremism in [LOC Pakistan  ] , [PER Alisherzai  ] said that the people living in the tribal areas “don’t know the value of life.” He blamed this on their lack of education and knowledge of the outside world , and said that they only know fighting and dying . 
In his view , investment in education and development was the only way to help the tribal areas , and said that years of “bad luck” had redirected development funds from the tribal areas to the urban population centers . 
He reiterated his support for military operations , but insisted that a program to educate young boys in the region must also be implemented . 
He noted that this program should be funded by [ORG NATO  ] and added , “I am only here today because of my education . 
Perhaps I would have been [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] too , if not for my education.” COMMENT: -------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Alisherzai  ] is from the [ORG Kurram Agency  ] , one of the seven tribal agencies that make up the [LOC Federally Administered Tribal Area  ] ( [ORG FATA  ] ) along the [LOC Afghanistan  ] border . 
As such , he is able to offer an insider’s view of life along the [MISC Pakistani-Afghan  ] border . 
His observation that intelligence and support provided by the local population has been essential to the success of [MISC Pakistani  ] military operations is worth noting , as are his suggestions as to how we might counter the growth of extremism in the region . 
However , his insights about larger regional issues ( ie: [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC India  ] , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] ) appear to be much more limited . 
End comment . 
[ORG BIOGRAPHIC NOTE  ] --------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Alisherzai  ] grew up in the [ORG FATA  ] bordering the [LOC Afghanistan  ] provinces of [LOC Khowst  ] and [LOC Paktya  ] .
