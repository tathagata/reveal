Business Wants Trade Liberalization ----------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Business representatives urged a renewed focus on trade negotiations during the GfG August 2 breakfast , attended by the Secretary and [PER Palocci  ] . 
[PER Benny Parnes  ] ( a former [ORG Central Bank  ] director ) of Banco BGM urged greater commercial integration between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] , specifically noting the advantages that [LOC Mexico  ] obtained from [ORG NAFTA  ] . 
[PER Roger Agnelli  ] of mining giant [ORG CVRD  ] observed that [LOC Brazil  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] have complementary economies that would stand to gain substantially from integration . 
[PER Nelio Weiss  ] of [ORG Price Waterhouse Coopers  ] added that many of his [MISC Brazilian  ] clients had just begun to invest in [LOC Central America  ] in order to obtain greater access to the [LOC U.S.  ] market under the recently-approved [ORG CAFTA  ] . 
Secretary Snow/Minister [PER Palocci  ] SIPDIS ------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) During their bilateral meeting August 1 , the Secretary noted the importance of trade liberalization for fostering growth . 
He declared that the recent [LOC U.S.  ] congressional approval of [ORG CAFTA  ] showed that the [ORG USG  ] still could muster the political strength necessary to maintain a pro-free trade policy . 
The [ORG USG  ] wants , the Secretary said , to take that momentum both to the [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations and the [ORG WTO Doha Round  ] . 
With respect to the latter , he expressed disappointment that there had been limited response to the call for trade liberalization in the financial services arena. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Palocci  ] averred that conditions were ripe for a renewed liberalization push both in the [ORG WTO  ] and [ORG FTAA  ] contexts . 
President [PER Lula  ] , [PER Palocci  ] said , has an open vision on trade and the Secretary , s visit could help renew momentum . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] Ambassador to the [LOC U.S.  ] , [PER Roberto Abdenur  ] ( who participated in most of the Secretary 's meetings ) restated the ( well-worn ) GoB position that it is ready to jump to four plus one ( [MISC Mercosul-U.S  ] . 
) market access negotiations given the current lack of progress on the [ORG FTAA  ] . 
[LOC Snow/Lula  ] --------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) During the Secretary 's meeting with President [PER Lula  ] , [PER Palocci  ] reported on the substance of their earlier meetings . 
[PER Palocci  ] argued again that conditions were ripe to restart the trade agenda and offered to spearhead a GoB interagency effort to rebuild momentum in trade negotiations , particularly in financial services . 
[PER Lula  ] did not respond specifically to [PER Palocci  ] 's offer. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Palocci  ] 's request for a presidential mandate to advance the trade agenda , which continues to be the exclusive domain of the foreign ministry , was likely motivated by a desire to find ways to spur productivity growth in the economy . 
With the microeconomic reform agenda completely stalled in the scandal-obsessed congress , pushing for trade liberalization is one of [PER Palocci  ] 's few remaining reform options . 
That [PER Lula  ] did not oblige likely speaks in equal measure to [ORG Itamaraty  ] 's entrenched position and to [PER Lula  ] 's distraction with the corruption scandal .
