Classified By: Ambassador [PER John R. Beyrle  ] ; reasons 1.4 ( b/d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: President [PER Medvedev  ] 's article " [MISC Russia Forward  ] , " released on the [MISC Internet  ] with little fanfare September 10 , launched a vociferous debate among politicians and analysts about the feasibility and probability of the kinds of reforms needed to implement his vision for a more diverse economy , healthier population and engaged citizenry . 
It also launched the fall political season , fueling speculation of divisions within the tandem and jockeying for position before 2012 elections . 
The article is not so much a break with the [PER Putin  ] past , as an attempt to moderate its excesses . 
Regardless of who wrote it , [PER Medvedev  ] has now linked his political fortunes to realizing its vision . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In a lengthy essay entitled " [MISC Russia Forward  ] , " first released mid-day September 10 on the liberal [MISC Gazeta.ru Internet  ] website , and later posted to the [LOC Kremlin  ] 's website , President [PER Medvedev  ] described a litany of ills that plague [MISC Russia:  ] reliance on the export of raw materials as the primary source of national income ; the decrepit state of infrastructure ; the cancer of corruption ; and the weaknesses of civil society and the institutions meant to channel citizen participation in government . 
It is a bluntly pessimistic assessment , combined with a vague call to action and an appeal to the public to support him in combating these ills and to rally , as they did in [MISC World War II  ] , to defeat these new enemies that threaten their country 's and children 's future . 
[PER Medvedev  ] focuses on the imperatives of modernization , of economic diversification and of the involvement of an active , engaged citizenry , in fighting corruption . 
He is unusually pointed in identifying an " ensconced group of corrupt officials and do-nothing entrepreneurs " as the chief source of these problems . 
The article presents no solutions to the maladies outlined . 
[PER Medvedev  ] is fact eschews the more liberal path of the 1990 's , repeating oft-used complaints against the " liberals " who brought political chaos and economic and financial destitution to [LOC Russia  ] by the end of that decade . 
Reactions - Call for Action ? 
Plea for Sympathy ? --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Medvedev  ] succeeded , if in doing nothing else , in giving political commentators ample material for policy - and political analysis . 
His manifesto answered the call of many elites who had been demanding a strong declaration of presidential views on the present situation . 
Others are connecting this article with his previous declarations , noting that , as in the past , the rhetoric comes without any concrete proposals for resolving these issues. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Speculation began immediately as to the author of the text . 
Some credit [PER Medvedev  ] with writing much of the article himself , noting that it elaborates on themes he has been publicly stressing during his presidency - his famous ( if dormant ) four " I 's , " the fight against corruption , poor infrastructure ( roads , health care , etc . 
) , demographic problems and the need for citizen participation . 
Some have focused on this exposition as a not-so-veiled critique of the [PER Putin  ] years - building on [PER Medvedev  ] 's earlier comments after the dam disaster about the country lagging technologically . 
However , others see in the text the hand of [PER Vladislav Surkov  ] , [LOC Kremlin  ] architect of [LOC Russia  ] 's " sovereign " democracy . 
Most of the article 's main themes - [LOC Russia  ] 's backwardness , the do-nothing entrepreneurs , high-tech as an economic salvation - were previewed by [PER Surkov  ] in a July 28 discussion with Ambassador . 
The appeal for greater public involvement in the managed , strictly-defined institutions created by [PER Surkov  ] could only have been promoted by the " [MISC Grey Cardinal  ] " himself. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) For the most part reaction among leading political commentators - on editorial pages of major newspapers , on the radio talk show circuit and on the plethora of politically-oriented blogs - has been politely welcoming of [PER Medvedev  ] 's intentions , but critical of the clear disconnect between his stated ideals , and the very different reality which he plays a role in sustaining . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] described [PER Medvedev  ] 's perspective as a " [MISC Soviet  ] way of looking at things ; " the reality , and what those in power paint as the reality , do not correspond . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] argued that it was hypocritical of [PER Medvedev  ] to talk about political competition when in [LOC Moscow  ] opposition parties are denied the right to participate in elections . 
He belittled the calls for political engagement by citizens in the current [MISC Putin-made  ] [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00002354 002 OF 003 system - of which [PER Medvedev  ] is a direct beneficiary - a system that has in fact dismantled pluralism and restricted political involvement. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] emphasized that the article is a trial balloon for [PER Medvedev  ] 's annual address to the nation ( poslanie ) , planned for late October or early November . 
It was reported weeks ago that [PER Medvedev  ] and a team of consultants had already begun work on a draft during summer holidays in [LOC Sochi  ] . 
While his 2008 poslanie centered on political reform , his 2009 address is said to focus on economic reforms . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] charged that the article - perhaps one basis for the poslanie - is an appeal for ideas , but not a clear call to liberals trumpeting their goals and aspirations . 
Rather , it charts a middle course , and will be used by both liberals and conservatives for their own purposes . 
It is a political document , intended not to advance the goals he speaks of , but to bolster his position among both camps . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] criticized the article for not having outlined solutions and for its sharp rejection of any constructive lessons that could be gleaned from the so-called liberal ways of the 1990 's and be applied to address [LOC Russia  ] 's problems of today . 
[PER Medvedev  ] in 2012 ? 
[ORG Tandem Tensions  ] ? ---------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] has warmed to giving him the benefit of the doubt in recent months , told us that he appreciated the sentiments that motivated the article , but was frustrated that there was no plan outlined for action . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] argued that the kind of development envisioned by [PER Medvedev  ] is hindered by an alliance between business and government bureaucracy - business pays off the bureaucracy and bureaucracy defends business from real competition . 
Until that bond is broken , real economic reform based on innovation will be impossible . 
[PER Medvedev  ] 's indictment of the judicial system was also on target , he told us , but would require a long-term commitment to fighting entrenched interests if it is to be reformed. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] called the article 's ideas " [PER Putin  ] 2.0 , " modifications to the general principles that have guided [LOC Russia  ] over the past decade , but not a rejection of them . 
Combined with [PER Putin  ] once again publicly toying with the idea of running for president in 2012 , [PER Medvedev  ] 's article revives speculation that the two leaders do not see eye-to-eye on major issues , and that should [PER Medvedev  ] not build momentum for the changes he espouses , [PER Putin  ] may step forward to present a status quo platform more to the liking of the oligarchs and possibly more appealing to average citizens . 
While the [MISC Internet  ] is abuzz with commentary on the article , state-run television has accorded it minimal coverage , focusing more on [PER Putin  ] 's annual performance before the [ORG Valdai Group.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Kremlin-sanctioned opposition political parties ( [ORG KPRF  ] , [ORG LDPR  ] , Just [LOC Russia  ] and [ORG Right Cause  ] ) issued mildly supportive statements about the President 's appeal for national dialogue , though [ORG KPRF  ] Deputy [PER Chairman Melnikov  ] argued that the call will fall on deaf ears given that " the state has worked hard to switch off the peoples' minds in recent years . 
" [MISC Yabloko  ] leadership issued a scathing rebuke , calling the article nothing but empty words when judged against [PER Medvedev  ] 's ineffectiveness in defending basic freedoms and democracy during his presidency . 
Where to from Here ? ------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) While the initial disappointment over the absence of concrete proposals may be understandable , [PER Medvedev  ] himself cautioned that change would be evolutionary , not revolutionary . 
Taken with the results of a recent [LOC Levada  ] poll that shows regional leaders more disposed toward [PER Putin  ] , [PER Medvedev  ] may be taking a slow approach , connecting with his " base " - urbanites , better-educated elites and the [MISC Internet-connected  ] middle class - seeking their support for processes which will have benefits not for them , but for their children . 
Having responded to the growing uneasiness among his " base " that he had not yet used his " bully pulpit " enough to put forward an agenda to correct the political deterioration and economically-myopic policies of the [PER Putin  ] years ( fixated on the export of raw materials ) , [PER Medvedev  ] has sparked a national debate - at least among those with access [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00002354 003 OF 003 to the [MISC Internet  ] ( 33 percent of [MISC Russians  ] ) . 
Given that [PER Putin  ] 's support is the main source of [PER Medvedev  ] 's hold on power , it is hard to imagine that the article could have been released without general agreement with its content by [PER Putin  ] himself . 
Whoever wrote the actual article , it is a first-person [PER Medvedev  ] document , and his political credibility depends on follow-through -- with citizens , in his poslanie and in taking on entrenched bureaucratic and business interests .
