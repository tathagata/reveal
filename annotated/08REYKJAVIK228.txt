1 . 
( C ) Two [MISC Icelandic  ] bankers met with Econoff today to emphasize that the [MISC Icelandic  ] authorities have chosen the wrong path out of this crisis and appealed for [LOC Washington  ] to provide guidance to the GOI . 
The bankers shared a graph that showed of the 11 billion euro [ORG Landsbanki  ] debt , 31 percent belonged to the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Canada  ] . 
They emphasized that [ORG Landsbanki  ] had the smallest foreign debt of the three banks in [LOC Iceland  ] and that [MISC American  ] investors will lose billions . 
They outlined a plan emphasizing the importance of bringing the creditors to the table , getting the [ORG IMF  ] involved and finding a resolution through a multilateral approach . 
They stressed the need for the [LOC U.S.  ] to become involved both to encourage the [MISC Icelandic  ] authorities to " be rational and swallow their pride " and for the [LOC U.S.  ] to build consensus within the [ORG IMF  ] to allow [LOC Iceland  ] access to the supplemental reserve facility such as [LOC Korea  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] and [LOC Russia  ] have used in the past . 
They believe that the [ORG IMF  ] stamp of approval will help bring creditors to the table and what is needed the most is a coordinated multilateral approach . 
2 . 
( C ) Today 's media showed an increasing chorus of calls for [LOC Iceland  ] to come to terms with the [ORG IMF  ] as the only way out of disaster . 
Embassy contacts in the business community this afternoon echoed this sentiment . 
We are told that [ORG Central Bank  ] director [PER David Oddson  ] is fighting any move to come to terms with the [ORG IMF  ] , but our sampling suggests that more people are coming to the reluctant conclusion that [LOC Iceland  ] will have to bite this bullet . 
The Prime Minister was repeatedly asked about a deal with the [ORG IMF  ] at today 's press conference . 
He brushed off suggestions that a deal had been made but stressed that the GOI is talking to the [ORG IMF  ] in [LOC Reykjavik  ] and in [LOC Washington  ] .
