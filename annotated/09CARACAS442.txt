( C ) Summary: [ORG Embassy Caracas  ] notes a significant number of [MISC Cuban  ] medical personnel applying to be paroled into the [LOC United States  ] under the Significant Public Benefit Parole ( [ORG SPBP  ] ) for [ORG Cuban Medical Professionals  ] outside of [LOC Cuba  ] ( [ORG CMPP  ] ) .

End Summary. ----------------------------- [MISC CUBANS  ] DOCTORS FLEE [LOC VENEZUELA  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [ORG Consular Section  ] at [ORG US Embassy Caracas  ] began accepting applications for [ORG SPBP  ] on August 18 , 2006 . 
To date , the [ORG Embassy  ] has received paperwork and forwarded to the [ORG Department of Homeland Security  ] ( [ORG DHS  ] ) applications for 739 [MISC Cuban  ] asylum seekers , of which 69% or 510 were approved , 91 were denied and 138 are pending . 
Since February of 2009 , [ORG DHS  ] has notified Post that 73 [ORG Cuban Medical Personnel Program  ] ( [ORG CMPP  ] ) applicants have been approved for parole through the [LOC CMPP.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) In 2006 and 2007 [ORG Embassy Caracas  ] facilitated travel to [LOC Miami  ] for program applicants through the issuance of transportation letters authorizing [MISC Cubans  ] to board [LOC US  ] bound aircraft . 
By October 2007 , [MISC Venezuelan  ] immigration officials began refusing to board defecting [MISC Cubans  ] on onward flights to [LOC Miami  ] in an unpredictable and ad-hoc manner . 
To enhance fraud protection due to insecurity of the travel letter , ( one letter was used by an imposture ) , Post sought and received [LOC CA  ] approval to issue [ORG YY  ] visa foils instead of transportation letters . 
Having a visa foil in their passports has facilitated the departure of most parolees . 
The [ORG Consular Section  ] began issuing [ORG YY  ] visa foils in February 2009 to approved [MISC Cuban  ] Medical Parolees . 
Of the 73 approved [ORG CMPP  ] applicants in 2009 , 43 have been issued [ORG YY  ] visa foils , 39 have successfully passed through immigration and boarded their flight to [LOC Miami  ] , and two have confirmed plans to travel in the near future . 
Thirty approved applicants have not yet confirmed travel plans because they currently are unable to travel , do not have the financial resources to leave [LOC Venezuela  ] , or have been forced to return to [LOC Cuba  ] . 
Two applicants were unsuccessful in their attempt to leave [LOC Venezuela  ] from the [LOC Barcelona  ] ( [LOC Venezuela  ] ) airport . 
Note: Most [ORG CMPP  ] applicants departing from the [LOC Caracas  ] airport have been successful in boarding their flight to [LOC Miami  ] . 
Following the approval of parole by [ORG DHS  ] , [ORG CMPP  ] applicants must enter the [LOC US  ] within 60 days .

( C ) The majority of the [ORG CMPP  ] applicants interviewed by Post were originally conscripted to work in social programs such as Mission [PER Barrio Adentro  ] , a [ORG GBRV  ] sponsored program that provides health care to city slums and rural communities , or similar [ORG GBRV  ] poverty reduction programs in medicine , sports , and the arts . 
In its annual 2008 report , the [LOC Caracas  ] based human rights [PER NGO PROVEA  ] estimated that 14,345 [MISC Cuban  ] medical professionals were originally assigned to work in [LOC Venezuela  ] following the inauguration of [LOC Barrio Adentro  ] in December <a id='par2003' href='#par2003'>¶</a>2003 . 
Currently only about 8,500 [MISC Cubans  ] are estimated to be employed in social programs across the country . 
While some [ORG CMPP  ] applicants told [ORG Consular  ] officials they volunteered to come to [LOC Venezuela  ] , many others have complained of being forced ( or directed ) by [MISC Cuban  ] authorities to work in [LOC Venezuela  ] under President [PER Chavez  ] 's social mission programs for a period of 1-3 years . 
[LOC CARACAS  ] 00000442 002.2 OF 003 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Many [ORG CMPP  ] applicants have reported that upon arrival in [LOC Venezuela  ] , [ORG Barrio Adentro Mission  ] officials have confiscated the passports of program participants to prevent their fleeing the mission . 
According to one applicant who was interviewed on January 27 , 2009 , the coordinator of the [MISC Cuban  ] medical mission ( [ORG Barrio Adentro  ] 2 , [LOC Aragua  ] state ) had been holding his and his other colleagues' passports since April 2008 , when another [MISC Cuban  ] had abandoned the mission , as a " means of preventing other desertions . 
" The applicant did not receive his passport back until he went on a scheduled vacation in September 2008 to [LOC Cuba  ] . 
Upon his return to [LOC Venezuela  ] in October 2008 he was not required by mission authorities to turn over his passport a second time . 
The [ORG CMPP  ] applicant received Significant Public Benefit Parole on March 2 , 2009 , was issued a [ORG YY  ] visa foil , successfully fled [LOC Venezuela  ] , and arrived in [LOC Miami  ] on March 16 , 2009. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) During [ORG Consular  ] section interviews in March , [MISC Cuban  ] medical personnel affiliated with [PER Chavez  ] 's [LOC Barrio Adentro  ] program complained of extremely poor working conditions , low pay , limited medical supplies , and of constantly being watched and monitored by co-workers . 
According to one doctor who successfully fled on March 10 , " All the effort I put into my work is not recognized by anyone.. . 
I am not well paid and only make 715 BsF ( 332 USD ) a month in [LOC Venezuela  ] , I want to change my life . 
" The doctor told [ORG Consular Officers  ] that he is forced to attend to 250-300 patients a week and " can only use obsolete and inferior [MISC Cuban  ] medicine " . 
A rehabilitation therapist who successfully fled on March 16 opined , " I feel politically manipulated . 
The system is closing my chances and I want to be a better professional . 
I have a lack of equipment and medicine in my job . 
I want to be a free man . 
I want to be a surgeon specialist . 
" On March 30 one [ORG CMPP  ] applicant , who managed to escape his mission for several hours and was clearly anxious to return before his supervisor realized he was gone , told [MISC Poloff  ] " They are always watching us , checking in with us at random times , asking what we are doing and calling us on our cell phones . 
" While noting that he has not received any physical threats so far during his time in [LOC Venezuela  ] , he commented " It is a psychological battle that we must endure every day . 
" ---------------------------------------- CORRUPTION , DESPERATION , [ORG GBRV  ] CLAMP DOWN ---------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The Government of the [LOC Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela  ] ( [ORG GBRV  ] ) began clamping down on [MISC Cubans  ] attempting to flee the island via [LOC Venezuela  ] in 2007 . 
While many applicants have successfully fled [LOC Cuba  ] through [LOC Venezuela  ] , others have been detained upon attempting to depart and presumably deported to [LOC Cuba  ] . 
Recent asylum seekers have complained of having to pay exorbitant bribes ( usually around 1,000 USD ) to [MISC Venezuelan  ] customs officials when attempting to exit the country en-route to [LOC Miami.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) As recently as March 24 a [MISC Cuban  ] couple attempted to board a flight from [LOC Barcelona  ] ( [LOC Venezuela  ] ) to [LOC Miami  ] after the [ORG US Embassy  ] issued [ORG YY  ] visa foils for their onward travel . 
The couple paid over 4,600 USD to " a contact " to assist them in clearing [ORG GBRV  ] immigration . 
After their flight was delayed and a shift change occurred at the airport , the couple was questioned by [MISC Venezuelan  ] immigration authorities who turned them over to the [ORG National Guard  ] . 
The military later contacted [MISC Cuban  ] officials . 
The couple was eventually moved to a hotel by [MISC Cuban  ] " security " and told they would be deported to [LOC Cuba  ] . 
The [ORG CMPP  ] applicants later escaped their captors and fled to the [ORG US Embassy  ] , where a local contact picked them up and reportedly took them into hiding . 
The traumatized couple told [ORG US Consular  ] officers the [MISC Cuban  ] " police " who detained them were also " [LOC Barrio Adentro Mission  ] officials " . 
According to the female [ORG CMPP  ] applicant , the " [MISC Cuban  ] police " threatened to rape her and beat up her boyfriend . 
Note: Recent [ORG CMPP  ] applicants have reported to [ORG Consular Officers  ] that after leaving [LOC Barrio Adentro  ] , occasionally some [MISC Venezuelans  ] are willing to help [MISC Cubans  ] who are in hiding . 
Little is known about the individuals who assist [MISC Cuban  ] medical personnel once they abandon [PER Chavez  ] 's " missions . 
" End Note. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) Comment: Due to the risk [ORG CMPP  ] applicants have of being stopped by [ORG GBRV  ] authorities prior to boarding [LOC Miami  ] [LOC CARACAS  ] 00000442 003.2 OF 003 bound aircraft , some [MISC Cuban  ] parolees have considered ( or are considering ) undertaking a cross border overland trip to [LOC Bogota  ] . 
While [ORG Post  ] does not advise parolees on which route ( if any ) is less risky , the issuance of [ORG YY  ] visa foils by [ORG Post  ] has reduced the probability of [ORG GBRV  ] immigration officials detecting a parolee prior to his or her departure . 
[ORG Post  ] believes , however , that it is only a matter of time before [ORG GBRV  ] immigration officials become alert to the [ORG YY  ] visa foils and are able to further tighten the [ORG GBRV  ] 's clamp down on [MISC Cubans  ] planning to abandon the social missions and flee the country . 
With the February approval of 73 applicants by [ORG DHS  ] , ( over 25 applicants have been issued [ORG YY  ] visa foils in the past two weeks alone ) , and more cases pending approval , [ORG Post  ] continues to meet the demand of [MISC Cuban  ] medical personnel hoping to flee [LOC Venezuela  ] rather than face the prospect of returning to [LOC Cuba  ] .
