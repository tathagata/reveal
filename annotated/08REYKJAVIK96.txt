( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: [MISC Icelandic  ] President [PER Olafur Ragnar Grimsson  ] won re-election by default on May 24 after the deadline for candidate registration passed with no challengers announcing . 
The election , previously scheduled for June 28 , has been cancelled ; [PER Grimsson  ] will start his fourth , and likely last , term in August . 
The news came as no surprise to Icelanders , as borne out by modest media coverage . 
The lack of challengers reflects [PER Grimsson  ] 's success in moving on from the controversy of 2004 , when he won re-election but with a record number of spoiled " protest " ballots . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Iceland  ] 's presidential elections were previously scheduled for June 28 , with a deadline for potential candidates to file with the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] by May 24 . 
Incumbent President [PER Olafur Ragnar Grimsson  ] was the only candidate to do so , and has therefore won the election by default as per [ORG Article  ] 5 of the [MISC Icelandic  ] Constitution . 
The results will be certified by the [ORG Supreme Court  ] on June 11 . 
[PER Grimsson  ] was first elected President of [LOC Iceland  ] in 1996 ; he was re-elected by default in 2000 , and beat two opponents in <a id='par2004' href='#par2004'>¶</a>2004 . 
He announced in his televised 2008 [MISC New Year 's Day Address  ] that he would run for a fourth term this year ( Ref A ) . 
[PER Grimsson  ] will be re-inaugurated on August 1. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) [PER Grimsson  ] seems to have largely overcome the controversy of his earlier term in office . 
Voter turnout in the 2004 presidential election was only 62.9 percent , which was the lowest ever for an [MISC Icelandic  ] presidential election ( Ref B ) . 
( By comparison , in parliamentary elections voter turnout typically ranges between 80 and 90 percent . 
) Twenty-three percent of votes cast in 2004 were empty ballots , or protest votes . 
This means that only 67 percent of those who went to the polls voted for [PER Grimsson  ] . 
At the time , many were unhappy over [PER Grimsson  ] 's public feuding with the government of then-Prime Minister [PER David Oddsson  ] and [PER Grimsson  ] 's refusal to sign a controversial bill restricting media ownership . 
Though a large part of the public also opposed the bill , many viewed [PER Grimsson  ] 's veto -- the first ever in [MISC Icelandic  ] history -- as an unwelcome change to a largely ceremonial office . 
In contrast , in the wake of [PER Grimsson  ] 's announcement this year that he would run for the fourth time , a January [MISC Gallup  ] poll showed that 86 percent supported him as President , and 80 percent said they were in favor of his running for the presidency for the fourth time . 
Nevertheless , over half of the people asked said that the appropriate tenure for a President should be 10-12 years. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Comment: It  ] had been somewhat expected in recent months that no one -- or at least no one with serious intentions -- would challenge President [PER Grimsson  ] . 
Hence , his re-election by default did not come as a total surprise , which is buttressed by the fact that news coverage of the event was minimal and no politicians made any remarks in regards to it . 
When [PER Grimsson  ] finishes his fourth term in 2012 he will have been President for 16 years , but it is widely believed that he will not run again . 
In the past it was rumored that after he stepped down as President he would try to land a high-profile international job , for example , with the [ORG United Nations  ] . 
An English-language biography slated to be published before Christmas 2007 was put on hold indefinitely last fall . 
The biography , probably intended to raise [PER Grimsson  ] 's international profile , was widely construed as preparation for a career change , but that too looks to be on hold for the time being .
