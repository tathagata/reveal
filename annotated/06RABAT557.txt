( C ) [MISC Summary: Over  ] lunch March 20 , [MISC Spanish  ] Ambassador [PER Planas Puchades  ] told Ambassador [PER Riley  ] that [LOC Spain  ] continued to encourage [LOC Morocco  ] to produce a credible autonomy plan for the [LOC Western Sahara  ] . 
He dismissed alleged splits within the [MISC Polisario  ] , suggesting the recently emerged faction " Line of Martyrs " seemed to be made up of disgruntled or former [MISC Polisario  ] members living in the [LOC Canary Islands  ] , and " it is not significant . 
" [PER Planas  ] pointedly did not reiterate [MISC Spanish  ] concern about [PER Van Walsum  ] 's remarks on pulling the [ORG Security Council  ] back from the [LOC Sahara  ] dispute or [LOC US  ] interest in downsizing [LOC MINURSO  ] . 
On migration , [PER Planas  ] expressed disappointment with [LOC Algeria  ] 's apparent decision not to participate in the July regional conference in [LOC Rabat  ] , which [PER Planas  ] said enjoyed [ORG EU  ] buy-in . 
[PER Planas  ] was interested in a recent [ORG International Republican Institute  ] ( [ORG IRI  ] ) poll that appeared in the March 18 issue of [MISC Moroccan  ] weekly [ORG Le Journal  ] , which indicated strong support for [LOC Morocco  ] 's [MISC Islamist  ] party . 
The conversation touched briefly on the upcoming [MISC NATO High-level  ] event in [LOC Rabat  ] , [MISC Spanish  ] investment in [LOC Morocco  ] , and narcotics . 
End Summary . 
[LOC Western Sahara  ] -------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Continuing a series of reciprocal lunches , [MISC Spanish  ] Ambassador [PER Planas Puchades  ] hosted Ambassador [PER Riley  ] and Polcouns to lunch at the [MISC Spanish  ] residence on March 20 . 
[PER Planas  ] was accompanied by his new DCM and previously [MISC Spanish  ] Ambassador in [LOC Nigeria  ] , [PER Alfonso Portabales  ] , who had arrived in [LOC Morocco  ] the previous week. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Planas  ] said the [ORG GOS  ] was following with great interest the King 's much-anticipated visit to [LOC Western Sahara  ] ( March 20-25 ; see ref A ) . 
Ambassador [PER Riley  ] noted we were also following the visit with interest . 
[PER Planas  ] said [LOC Spain  ] 's primary message to [LOC Morocco  ] at this point was one he believed we shared: [LOC Morocco  ] should present a credible autonomy plan . 
[PER Planas  ] said [LOC Spain  ] would need to review the plan before taking a position on it , but in the meantime the [ORG GOS  ] was providing " comfort and support " to the GOM to produce a serious plan . 
[PER Planas  ] was somewhat dismissive of the consultation process with [MISC Moroccan  ] political parties , saying he understood the parties' meetings with Palace advisor [PER Mohamed Moatassim  ] were " not really an exchange . 
" He said , nevertheless , that conferences such as that held by the [ORG PJD  ] and [ORG FC  ] several weeks ago ( Ref B ) " were okay . 
" [PER Planas  ] said the [MISC Spanish  ] have been clear with [LOC Morocco  ] that the autonomy plan must be concrete and not conservative . 
Ambassador [PER Riley  ] said this was a key [LOC US  ] message as well. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Planas  ] said the reported split within the [MISC Polisario  ] ( the so-called [ORG Ligne de Martyrs  ] , or Line of Martyrs ) was not significant . 
These were mostly individuals based in the [LOC Canary Islands  ] . 
While the split itself was not significant , [PER Planas  ] believed there was growing frustration in [LOC Tindouf  ] , but it might not be related solely to pressure for negotiation . 
[PER Planas  ] noted that the [MISC Polisario  ] cause continued to resonate with [MISC Spaniards  ] , who visited [LOC Tindouf  ] in large numbers every year as families back in [LOC Spain  ] opened their doors to 5000-10,000 Sahrawis for home stays. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Planas  ] did not echo [ORG GOS  ] concern about the possible backing off of the [LOC Western Sahara  ] conflict by the [ORG Security Council  ] as advocated by [PER UN Envoy Van Walsum  ] ; nor he did express concern about a possible [LOC MINURSO  ] drawdown . 
Migration --------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Planas  ] said there continued to be good cooperation between [LOC Morocco  ] and [LOC Spain  ] on migration issues , especially after the unfortunate deaths on the frontiers of the [MISC Spanish  ] enclaves last fall . 
[PER Planas  ] said the [ORG GOS  ] was pleased [LOC Morocco  ] had announced it was holding a regional conference on migration in [LOC Rabat  ] in July , but he regretted that [LOC Algeria  ] had apparently decided not to participate ( he actually said [LOC Algeria  ] 's non-participation was " dangerous . 
" ) on the ground that the [ORG AU  ] was already organizing migration conferences . 
The [LOC Rabat  ] conference , [PER Planas  ] said , enjoyed solid support from [LOC France  ] and the [ORG EU  ] , as well as [LOC Spain  ] . 
He was concerned about the growth of trafficking networks in the region , noting that some migrants bought " travel packs " ( a package of movements -- by road , car , ship , with a series of handlers at each phase -- to get one to the desired destination ) , which from his information cost thousands of dollars , with no certainty that one would ever reach the destination . 
Islamists --------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Planas  ] had read with interest recent coverage in [MISC Moroccan  ] weekly [ORG Le Journal  ] of an " [MISC American  ] poll " on [MISC Moroccan  ] political attitudes ( the poll was conducted by the [ORG International Republican Institute  ] but was not intended to be shared with the press ; according to [ORG IRI  ] , one of political parties that had helped with the poll likely leaked it . 
Full details and embassy analysis of the results can be found in Ref C ) . 
[PER Planas  ] said the results , purporting to forecast a likely [ORG PJD  ] victory in the 2007 parliamentary elections , were very interesting . 
[PER Planas  ] said even if it won many seats the [ORG PJD  ] probably would not be able to govern without a coalition . 
Other political parties are being slow to democratize , [PER Planas  ] said ; their leaders are old and there is little dynamism in the ranks . 
The [ORG PJD  ] seems to be following the [MISC Erdogan  ] path , he added ( see Ref C ) . 
[MISC NATO High-Level Event  ] --------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Planas  ] raised [LOC Morocco  ] 's hosting of the upcoming [MISC NATO High-Level Event  ] ( April 6-7 in [LOC Rabat  ] ) and said it was an important event for [LOC Morocco  ] , especially as it followed the meeting of [ORG NATO  ] and [ORG Med Dialogue Defense Ministers  ] in [LOC Taormina  ] in February . 
[PER Planas  ] added that the upcoming 50th anniversary of the [MISC Moroccan  ] Armed Forces was also a showcase event for [LOC Morocco  ] , and he hoped the [LOC US  ] would participate robustly . 
( Comment: we are firming up a robust [LOC US  ] participation in the 50th Anniversary of the FAR celebrations and have tentatively secured a DV embarkation onboard a [LOC U.S.  ] aircraft carrier as part of the event . 
End Comment ) . 
Ambassador [PER Riley  ] thanked [PER Planas  ] for [MISC Spanish  ] support for the recent planning conference for an upcoming exercise , [ORG Phoenix Express  ] , which brought together [MISC Moroccan  ] , [MISC Algerian  ] , and [MISC Spanish  ] naval officers for a week in [LOC Rabat  ] . 
[MISC Spanish  ] Investment ------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Riley  ] noted [LOC Spain  ] 's announcement in February of a 200 million [MISC Euro  ] plan to facilitate small and medium-sized enterprises in [LOC Morocco  ] . 
( [LOC Spain  ] is [LOC Morocco  ] , s second largest investor ) . 
[PER Planas  ] said he hoped the plan would assist [MISC Spanish  ] enterprises but said [LOC Morocco  ] remained a challenging place to do business given lack of transparency . 
In terms of providing aid to [LOC Morocco  ] Ambassador [PER Riley  ] said there ought to be better coordination among donors and suggested small meetings for donors for specific regions in [LOC Morocco  ] , not for all programs in the whole country , especially given the [ORG MCA  ] activities . 
[PER Planas  ] agreed and pointed out that two thirds of [MISC Spanish  ] aid to [LOC Morocco  ] went to the northern part of the country . 
Narcotics --------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( SBU ) [PER Planas  ] noted that [LOC Spain  ] was developing plans to promote tobacco production in [LOC Larache  ] province ( between [LOC Rabat  ] and [LOC Tangiers  ] ) as a way of promoting alternatives to narcotics cultivation in northern [LOC Morocco.  ] ****************************************** Visit Embassy [LOC Rabat  ] 's Classified Website ; http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/rabat ****************************************** Riley</pre></code>
