[ORG REF: LISBON  ] 88 Classified By: DEPUTY POL/ECON COUNSELOR TROY FITRELL FOR REASONS 1.4 ( b , d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C/NF ) Summary . 
This is a primer on each of [LOC Portugal  ] 's major parties and what is driving them for the election season , plus specific expectations for the June 7 [MISC European  ] elections . 
[LOC Portugal  ] has three elections this year ; the June 7 elections for the [MISC European  ] [ORG Parliament  ] , plus legislative and municipal elections later this autumn . 
Election season is in full swing , but major parties are riven with internal dissent . 
None of them is campaigning effectively and voter apathy is the major issue , as the [MISC European  ] [ORG Parliament  ] is divorced from [MISC Portuguese  ] daily life . 
It appears that only a quarter of eligible voters will likely turn out June 7 , and they will be voting for lists comprised of party insiders that inspire no one . 
Thus , the [MISC European  ] elections will not be a litmus test for national elections or even a gauge of the national mood . 
The far left will likely pick up a few seats in the [MISC European  ] [ORG Parliament  ] , but ruling Socialist Prime Minister [PER Socrates  ] is most concerned about maintaining his absolute majority in [LOC Portugal  ] 's parliament . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) Like many around the world , the [MISC Portuguese  ] were enthralled by the [LOC U.S.  ] election drama of 2008 . 
One of the themes repeated endlessly in [MISC Portuguese  ] commentary was admiration for the primary process in which voters winnow the candidate field through a succession of open plebiscites . 
In [LOC Portugal  ] , however , the desire for a primary process has degenerated into internecine warfare within each party , such that none appear to have a strategy designed to win under [LOC Portugal  ] 's parliamentary party list system. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) The June 7 elections for the [MISC European  ] [ORG Parliament  ] mark the first of [LOC Portugal  ] 's three elections this year . 
[LOC Portugal  ] 's legislative and local elections are expected in the autumn , by the end of October at the latest , with the dates to be determined . 
Editorialists are already opining about what the [MISC European  ] elections will mean for [LOC Portugal  ] 's national elections . 
Indeed , political discourse is entirely focused on issues more appropriate to national elections , such as crime , unemployment , and infrastructure . 
The picture is complicated because this year 's national elections will be the first to reserve one-third of the legislative seats for women . 
Also fueling internal bickering is that the [MISC Portuguese  ] delegation to the [MISC European  ] [ORG Parliament  ] will shrink from 24 seats to 22 following institutional reforms , ensuring that at least two [MISC Portuguese  ] politicians are going to have to give up the good life in [LOC Brussels  ] and [LOC Strasbourg.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) But [MISC European  ] elections will tell us little about the national mood because so few people are expected to take part . 
Turnout at the [MISC European  ] elections is traditionally quite low in [LOC Portugal  ] , and it is unlikely to match the 2004 turnout of 38 percent . 
None of the parties has engaged in major publicity campaigns ; billboards are scarce and vague in message and few grassroots efforts are underway . 
Further depressing this year 's turnout is that voting will be held on a holiday weekend. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) This is a primer on each of [LOC Portugal  ] 's major parties and what is driving them for the election season , plus specific expectations for the June 7 [MISC European  ] elections . 
SOCIALIST PARTY ( [ORG PS  ] ) -------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) All signs ought to be positive for the ruling Socialists , but one would not know it by listening to them . 
Prime Minister [PER Socrates  ] took over a dysfunctional government apparatus and an economy in poor shape when the [ORG PS  ] won parliament in 2005 . 
[PER Socrates  ] presided over an austerity budget and significant internal reforms that largely got [LOC Portugal  ] 's economic problems under control , meeting [ORG EU  ] benchmarks two years in advance . 
[PER Socrates  ] told us privately that the [ORG PS  ] victory earned him political capital that " is only useful if you use it . 
" To that end , [PER Socrates  ] overcame opposition from the trade unions that traditionally form the [ORG PS  ] base in order to enact labor reforms , raising the retirement age and cutting benefits to address what he termed , " a demographic time bomb . 
" Having fought -- and won -- those battles early in his tenure , [PER Socrates  ] was able to offer tax cuts and civil service pay increases this election year. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Socrates  ] and his pragmatists have shifted the party to the center . 
While this has emasculated the opposition parties on the center-right and right , it has invigorated the smaller leftist parties and frustrated the vocal left wing of the [ORG PS  ] itself . 
[PER Socrates  ] is betting that he can steal more support from the center than he will lose on the extreme left . 
He may be wrong for the short-term , but this may be an [ORG LISBON  ] 00000289 002 OF 003 astute move for the longer term , especially if he can hold on in national elections this fall . 
While shifting the party in regard to the political spectrum , [PER Socrates  ] is also looking at changing demographics throughout the country . 
The [ORG PS  ] promotes itself as the party of [LOC Europe  ] ( and [PER Socrates  ] was midwife to the [ORG Lisbon Treaty  ] in late 2007 ) . 
On social issues like abortion , divorce , and gay marriage , [ORG PS  ] policies are in line with [MISC European  ] norms , but alienate the country 's socially conservative [MISC Catholics  ] , a key voting bloc. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C/NF ) One of the old lions of the left wing of the Socialist Party , [PER Manuel Alegre  ] , is often said to want to form his own party in rebellion against the centrist-drifting [ORG PS  ] . 
He tells us privately that is not the case , although he would not rule it out publicly just yet . 
[PER Alegre  ] ran as an independent for the [MISC Portuguese  ] Presidency in 2006 , outpolling the [ORG PS  ] candidate , but falling just short of the center-right [ORG PSD  ] President [PER Cavaco Silva  ] . 
Rather than try to present a unified front now , [ORG PS  ] International Secretary [PER Jose Lello  ] ( presumably with Socrates' consent ) has taken to attacking [PER Alegre  ] in the media on a regular basis , attacks that dominate coverage of the [ORG PS  ] at the expense of any programmatic ideas they might wish to put forward. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) Even though the [ORG PS  ] needs to augment the number of women on its legislative list to meet the one third requirement , party leaders dumped three sitting female parliamentarians who are perceived to be [PER Alegre  ] supporters . 
Much media coverage of the party reflects leftist frustration that the [ORG PS  ] " isn't Socialist anymore . 
" [PER Socrates  ] remains upbeat , but will have difficulty governing should he lose the party 's absolute majority in parliament . 
Corruption allegations against [PER Socrates  ] from his time as Environment Minister will not likely result in any formal sanction , but tarnish his image ( [PER Ref A  ] ) . 
SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY ( [ORG PSD  ] ) ----------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C/NF ) The center-right [ORG PSD  ] is the second largest [MISC Portuguese  ] party and natural rival to the center-left [ORG PS  ] . 
One might think the internal divisions in the [ORG PS  ] would encourage the [ORG PSD  ] to take advantage of the situation by forging internal unity . 
That has not happened , as the [ORG PSD  ] is on its third leader in two years , with another leadership change possible before autumn elections . 
Current leader [PER Manuela Ferreira Leite  ] won an extremely tight three-way internal election last summer . 
Her selling point is that , as a former Economy Minister , she could fight the [ORG PS  ] where they were traditionally weakest . 
Unfortunately , she was Economy Minister during the worst economy of the last twenty years , following which the then-PSD government was turfed out of power by a large majority that voted for the [ORG PS  ] . 
[PER Ferreira Leite  ] subsequently denied her main rival , [PER Pedro Passos Coelho  ] , a party leadership position , freeing him to present his own proposals to the public in a nation-wide " listening tour . 
" President [PER Cavaco Silva  ] is [ORG PSD  ] but eschews party infighting and strives for balance within and among the parties. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C/NF ) [ORG PSD  ] backbenchers argue so much about whether the party should promote " more tax cuts " or " better tax cuts " that no one really knows -- least of all the [ORG PSD  ] parliamentarians themselves -- the party 's position . 
The [ORG PSD  ] polls well on infrastructure issues and is socially more [MISC Catholic  ] than the [ORG PS  ] . 
This keeps them in the picture , despite concerns regarding leadership ability . 
The [ORG PSD  ] has a good chance to regain the [LOC Lisbon  ] mayor 's seat , with former Prime Minister [PER Santana Lopes  ] displacing the competent but abrasive [ORG PS  ] Mayor [PER Antonio Costa  ] . 
The [ORG PSD  ] has not been able to capitalize on Socrates' corruption allegations as a number of its own leaders face similar allegations . 
PEOPLE'S PARTY ( [ORG CDS-PP  ] ) ----------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C/NF ) The right-of-center [ORG CDS-PP  ] had the same leadership mess as the [ORG PSD  ] , until former leader and former Defense Minister [PER Paulo Portas  ] returned to take the reins in April <a id='par2007' href='#par2007'>¶</a>2007 . 
[PER Portas  ] can be abrasive but he is also highly respected . 
He has placed the [ORG CDS-PP  ] in the center of most policy debates , filling the vacuum left by both the [ORG PS  ] and [ORG PSD  ] . 
Current polling data show the [ORG CDS-PP  ] below the threshold for representation in the national parliament . 
With popular support at such low levels , the [ORG CDS-PP  ] will likely not do well in the [MISC European  ] elections , but many believe that [PER Portas  ] could rally support for national elections . 
The [ORG CDS-PP  ] supporters are generally wealthy and well-educated , a small demographic in [LOC Portugal  ] . 
FAR LEFT: COMMUNIST , LEFT [MISC BLOC  ] , & [MISC GREENS  ] ( [ORG PCP  ] , BE , & [ORG PEV  ] ) --------------------------------------------- ------------ <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C/NF ) The [ORG Portuguese Communist Party  ] ( [ORG PCP  ] ) used to be a major political force but is a shadow of its former self . 
[LOC LISBON  ] 00000289 003 OF 003 The Socialists' abandonment of the extreme left , however , gave the [ORG PCP  ] a new lease on life , and it is polling at its former numbers , despite having no good leaders . 
The Left Bloc ( BE ) , comprises the younger left . 
The BE was vocal and effective in opposition to [ORG PS  ] reform proposals. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C/NF ) Both the [ORG PCP  ] and BE are poised to gain support in national legislative elections , but are too small to govern . 
Each party hopes to form a coalition with the [ORG PS  ] , not recognizing that the [ORG PS  ] leadership is fleeing from the far left and would prefer a weak minority government to a coalition with the far left. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C/NF ) The " other " leftist party , the [MISC Greens  ] ( [ORG PEV  ] ) counts more on links to other green parties around the world than on any substantive platform . 
Global attention has helped the [ORG PEV  ] 's polling numbers somewhat , but the party recently kicked its one articulate and respected parliamentarian off of the national committee and is now left without a respected public representative . 
[MISC EUROPEAN  ] ELECTION EXPECTATIONS ------------------------------ <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( U ) The current 24-member [MISC Portuguese  ] delegation to the [MISC European  ] Parliament breaks down like this: PS: 12 [ORG PSD:  ] 7 [ORG CDS-PP:  ] 2 [ORG PCP:  ] 2 [ORG BE:  ] 1 <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C/NF ) [ORG PS  ] list leader [PER Vital Moreira  ] got in the news for public shouting matches with [ORG PS  ] left-wingers at campaign rallies and then for proposing a [MISC European-wide  ] tax on financial transactions , which was lampooned by the opposition and repudiated by Prime Minister [PER Socrates  ] . 
The [ORG PS  ] would be happy to keep ten seats in the new 22-seat delegation . 
No [ORG PSD  ] leaders inspire confidence , but the [ORG PSD  ] might maintain its hold on its seven seats at the expense of the [ORG CDS-PP  ] ( who ran a combined list with the [ORG PSD  ] last time ) . 
The two seats the [ORG CDS-PP  ] hold were won at the high water mark of the party 's popularity and influence , so maintaining even one seat would be a success . 
The [ORG PCP  ] and BE have small voter bases , but they tend to turn out strongly on election day . 
The [ORG PCP  ] hopes to get four seats and the BE hopes to get three . 
It would be an extraordinary success if they reached seven seats combined , but they are certainly bound to have more than the three they currently hold . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C/NF ) Does anyone want to win this thing ? 
The ruling [ORG PS  ] should be running away with all three rounds of [MISC Portuguese  ] elections , given the [ORG PSD  ] 's hopeless management of the economy during its last turn in government , but internal bickering , silly gaffes , and the global economic crisis have left the door open to others . 
Corruption allegations affect virtually all the parties , but [MISC Portuguese  ] voters appear not to be bothered by them . 
Polls indicate that most voters think all politicians are corrupt , so specific allegations -- like those facing PM [PER Socrates  ] -- are not a bar to office . 
In the final run-up to June 7 [MISC European  ] elections , the campaigns have all turned to negative attacks on specific individuals , many of whom -- like [PER Socrates  ] and [PER Portas  ] -- are not currently candidates , a dubious strategy in an election process the uses a party list system .
