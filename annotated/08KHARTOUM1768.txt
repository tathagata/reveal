( C ) [MISC SUMMARY: On  ] December 7 , [ORG UNAMID’s Joint Special  ] Representative [PER Rodolphe Adada  ] said that [ORG UNAMID  ] continues to work on its plans for a ceasefire monitoring mechanism and asserted that [ORG UNAMID  ] , not the UN/AU Chief Mediator , should take the lead with ceasefire plans . 
[PER Adada  ] also said that [ORG UNAMID  ] needs to give more attention to the important role of [MISC Darfur’s Arabs  ] . 
[PER Adada  ] expressed concern about the lack of [ORG DPA  ] implementation , saying that the GoS’s failure to honor its agreements does little to persuade non-signatories to the negotiating table . 
He was also scathing about wildly inaccurate statements about loss of life in [LOC Darfur  ] made by [ORG ICC  ] prosecutor [PER Luis Moreno-Ocampo  ] . 
END SUMMARY . 
CEASEFIRE MECHANISM - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Adada  ] opened the meeting saying that he had just returned from a trip to [ORG UN Headquarters  ] in [LOC New York  ] where he briefed Undersecretary General for [ORG Peacekeeping Operations  ] , [PER Alain LeRoy  ] , on the [LOC U.S.  ] proposal for a [ORG Darfur Monitoring Team  ] ( [ORG DMT  ] ) . 
[PER Adada  ] reported that he was surprised that Special [PER Envoy Williamson  ] did not raise the [ORG DMT  ] with [PER Le Roy  ] in their last meeting , as [PER Adada  ] had prepped [PER Le Roy  ] on the [ORG USG  ] proposal . 
Reflecting on the [LOC U.S.  ] offer , [PER Adada  ] stated , “This is normally our job - but if you can help us with equipment , we would appreciate that.” Once the [LOC US  ] raises this with the [ORG UN  ] in [LOC New York  ] , they will respond formally. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Adada  ] said that [ORG UNAMID  ] continues to draft its plan for a ceasefire mechanism . 
( Note: [PER Adada  ] did not appear to be aware that his political chief , [PER Abdul Mohammed  ] , had discussed [ORG UNAMID’s  ] ceasefire mechanism in depth with us on December 2 ( ref . 
A ) . 
End Note . 
) He noted that most rebels are currently against the ceasefire offer , in particular SLA/Unity , which attack [ORG GoS  ] assets to sustain their movements. “I have talked to SLA/Unity leaders like [PER Sharif Harir  ] and they have told me outright , ‘We attack the [ORG GoS  ] because it is like our marketplace , ” said [PER Adada  ] . 
[PER Adada  ] noted that any successful ceasefire must incorporate non-military logistical support for the rebel movements . 
He stated that although it was far from perfect , the generous monthly stipend allowance provided by [ORG AMIS  ] served as almost a form of non-military logistical support for the rebels . 
[PER Adada  ] also hinted that the [ORG GoS  ] will likely resist any form of assistance to the rebels as “the [ORG GoS  ] wants the rebels to cause problems for everyone and make them ( i.e. the rebels ) look bad.” He noted that while the international community may be eager for a ceasefire , they probably won’t be ready to pay for the rebels not to fight. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG CDA Fernandez  ] asked how the [ORG Joint Mediation Support Team  ] ( [ORG JMST  ] ) led by Chief Mediator [PER Djibril Bassole  ] and [ORG UNAMID  ] were coordinating their efforts on a ceasefire . 
[PER Adada  ] responded by saying that “Bassole can speak in general terms about the need for a ceasefire , but this is our job in [ORG UNAMID  ] to monitor violence in Darfur.” [PER Adada  ] then stated that [ORG UNAMID Force  ] Commander [PER Agwai  ] had a meeting the morning of December 7 devoted to coordination between the [ORG JMST  ] and [ORG UNAMID  ] on ceasefire issues . 
[PER Adada  ] then asserted that [PER Bassole  ] should focus his energy on the political negotiations necessary for a ceasefire , not the details of any mechanism that will monitor the agreement . 
[ORG CDA  ] urged closer coordination between [ORG UNAMID  ] and [PER Bassole  ] . 
NEED TO ADDRESS THE [MISC ARAB  ] TRIBES - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Unprompted , [PER Adada  ] then asked about the place of [MISC Darfur’s Arabs  ] , asking: “No one is taking care of them ; what should we do about [MISC Darfur’s Arabs  ] ? ” [PER Adada  ] said that the [MISC Arab  ] tribes are essential for the stability of [LOC Darfur  ] , and provided an example of how [MISC Arabs  ] , loosely integrated into [ORG GoS  ] security forces , attacked [ORG GoS  ] assets in the spring of 2008 . 
He said it is important to differentiate between the [MISC Arab  ] tribes and the janjaweed , and admitted that [ORG UNAMID  ] has not done enough outreach to the [MISC Arab  ] tribes . 
[ORG CDA Fernandez  ] agreed with [PER Adada  ] and noted that it is important to encourage [MISC Darfur’s Arabs  ] to take a position independent from the [ORG GoS  ] . 
He noted that the [LOC U.S  ] . 
( at least the [LOC US  ] Embassy in [LOC Khartoum  ] ) has attempted to reach out to a broad spectrum of [MISC Arab  ] leaders ( e.g. ref . 
B ) , and said that successful USAID programming in [MISC Arab  ] areas in [LOC Darfur  ] ( such as Ad-Daien ) should be expanded . 
[PER Adada  ] agreed with [ORG CDA Fernandez  ] that the [ORG GoS  ] has very weak control in [LOC Darfur  ] , and that it uses the [MISC Arab  ] tribes to rule the region . 
IMPORTANCE AND COMPLEXITY OF SLM/MM’S ROLE - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Adada  ] next turned to the role of [LOC SLM/Minnawi  ] , saying that the [ORG GoS  ] needs to implement the [ORG Darfur Peace Agreement  ] in order to make a statement to the non-signatories . 
He joked , “The [ORG GoS  ] better implement the agreement , otherwise every movement that signs an agreement with the government will be ‘minni-mized’ like [PER Minni  ] has been ! ” [ORG CDA Fernandez  ] concurred , and then briefed [PER Adada  ] on the GoS’s failure to make any significant progress in [ORG DPA  ] implementation since Vice President Taha’s agreement with [PER Minnawi  ] on September 19 . 
[PER Adada  ] appeared surprised by the CDA’s remarks , and said that implementing the [ORG DPA  ] is one way to support CPA implementation , a clear priority to the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC OCAMPO’S  ] IMAGINARY NUMBERS - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Adada  ] poured scorn on the “wildly inaccurate” recent statements of [ORG ICC  ] prosecutor [PER Luis Moreno-Ocampo  ] that “5,000 people were being killed each month in Darfur.” He added that who would be so naive and ill-informed to believe such a thing ? 
He noted that this would be over a hundred people a day being killed , a level of violence not seen in [LOC Darfur  ] for several years ( Note: probably not since 2005 ) . 
Even the horrific [LOC Kalma  ] camp massacre of August 25 , 2008 which killed 33 innocent people was “one crime on one day , this doesn’t happen very often.” He mused that such patently absurd and false information put out by [PER Ocampo  ] doesn’t make him look very credible in the eyes of those who actually know something about the reality of [LOC Darfur  ] . 
COMMENT - - - - <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Adada  ] appeared reluctant to discuss the ceasefire mechanism in any detail and made it clear that he would like [ORG UNAMID  ] ( and not the Chief Mediator nor the [ORG USG  ] ) to take the lead . 
[LOC Adada’s  ] dismissive remarks about the Chief Mediator indicate once more the existence of a strained working relationship between the latter and [ORG UNAMID  ] . 
[PER Adada  ] appeared poorly informed about the status of [LOC SLM/MM  ] and the lack of any real progress in [ORG DPA  ] implementation since the September Minnawi-Taha agreement . 
This is particularly disappointing considering the relatively substantial resources at [LOC Adada’s  ] disposal , the fact that he needs to focus solely on [LOC Darfur  ] , and the abundance of [LOC SLM/MM  ] contacts in [LOC Adada’s  ] headquarters in [LOC El-Fasher  ] and in [LOC Khartoum  ] .
