Godfrey  ] , [ORG CDA  ] , Embassy [LOC Tripoli  ] , Dept of State . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: In the course of a meeting on other issues , an [ORG MFA  ] interlocutor cautioned that recent public remarks by USG officials on the case of detained human rights activist [PER Fathi  ] el-Jahmi had not been helpful and could be construed as interference in [LOC Libya  ] 's domestic affairs . 
Unspecified elements of the [ORG GOL  ] were angered by public comments on el-Jahmi 's case at a conference on [LOC Libya  ] in [LOC Washington  ] . 
Post 's channel for engagement on el-Jahmi has been restricted to the quasi-governmental [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] ; the [ORG MFA  ] 's intervention potentially represents a new wrinkle . 
From the [ORG GOL  ] 's perspective , the fact that the remarks at the conference were public likely had as much to do with its adverse reaction as the substance of the intervention . 
End summary . 
2 . 
( C ) In a meeting with the [ORG CDA  ] and Poloff on April 1 on separate issues , [ORG MFA Americas Desk  ] Officer [PER Muhammad Ayab  ] asked the [ORG CDA  ] for clarification on PDAS [PER Feltman  ] 's March 31 remarks at a conference in [LOC Washington  ] hosted by the [ORG Middle East Institute  ] ( [ORG MEI  ] ) and [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG Green Book Society  ] ( [ORG GBS  ] ) calling for the immediate , unconditional release of detained human rights activist [PER Fathi  ] el [PER Jahmi  ] . 
Cautioning that such statements " ... will not help in building understanding " , he added the [ORG GOL  ] " hopes the [LOC U.S.  ] will accurately understand the situation and avoid interference in [LOC Libya  ] 's domestic affairs " . 
Reiterating points we 've heard before from the [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] ( [ORG QDF  ] ) , he said el-Jahmi had been transferred to the custody of his family and remained at the [ORG Tripoli Medical Center  ] ( [ORG TMC  ] ) - under his family 's supervision - for needed medical care . 
( [PER Note: Reftel  ] details Post 's understanding of el-Jahmi 's medical condition and issues preventing his discharge from the [ORG TMC  ] . 
End note . 
) [PER Feltman  ] 's remarks and [LOC U.S.  ] involvement " could " be construed as interference in [LOC Libya  ] 's domestic affairs . 
( [PER Note: Ayab  ] did not appear to have a clear understanding of what the remarks actually were . 
End note . 
) 3 . 
( C ) Pushing back , the [ORG CDA  ] reiterated points conveyed by NEA/MAG Director [PER Elizabeth Hopkins  ] to the [ORG QDF  ] 's Dr. [PER Yusuf Sawani  ] on the margins of the [MISC GBS/MEI  ] conference: 1 ) our understanding is that there is no medical reason for keeping el-Jahmi in hospital ; 2 ) el-Jahmi should be released from the [ORG TMC  ] now ; 3 ) there should be no formal conditions for el-Jahmi 's release and , 4 ) it is expected that the [ORG QDF  ] and [ORG GOL  ] will ensure el-Jahmi 's physical safety . 
4 . 
( C ) Noting the use of the word " should " , [PER Ayab  ] questioned whether the [LOC U.S.  ] was dictating to the [ORG GOL  ] that el-Jahmi must be released . 
The [ORG CDA  ] clarified that at the conclusion of the [ORG Human Rights Watch/Physicians for Human Rights  ] ( [ORG HRW/PHR  ] ) visit in mid-March , there was a perceived common understanding between the [ORG QDF  ] , [ORG HRW/PHR  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] that el-Jahmi was expected to leave the [ORG TMC  ] and return home on/about March 26 . 
That had not occurred . 
Our position , based on our understanding of el-Jahmi 's current condition - his cardiac condition was stable and his prostate condition was not serious - was that it was medically safe for the [ORG TMC  ] to discharge him . 
Noting that el-Jahmi 's case was the focus of considerable international attention , the [ORG CDA  ] stressed that the Embassy had respected the [ORG QDF  ] 's preference for quiet engagement . 
The fact that we had commented publicly at the [MISC GBR/MEI  ] conference underscored broad concern about the perception that the [ORG GOL  ] and [ORG QDF  ] were using el-Jahmi 's prostate condition as a pretext to delay discharging him from hospital . 
5 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Ayab  ] 's intervention on el-Jahmi 's case represents a new development ; post 's communication since late last year on this issue has been restricted to [ORG QDF  ] channels . 
Our principal interlocutor , the [ORG QDF  ] 's Dr. [PER Yusuf Sawani  ] , has been more measured in cautioning us against giving the appearance of meddling in an ostensibly internal [MISC Libyan  ] matter . 
[PER Ayab  ] does not typically engage on these issues and did not appear to be fully briefed ( his colleague , [PER Muhammad Matari  ] , typically handles such issues , but is in [LOC Washington  ] for the [MISC GBR/MEI  ] conference ) . 
Nonetheless , [PER Ayab  ] called the [ORG CDA  ] after the meeting to stress that unspecified [ORG GOL  ] elements were " angry " about [PER Feltman  ] 's comments at the [MISC GBR/MEI  ] conference . 
From the [ORG GOL  ] 's perspective , the fact that the remarks were public likely had as much to do with its adverse reaction as the substance of the intervention . 
End comment .
