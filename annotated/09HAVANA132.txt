Reason: 1.4 ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary . 
The risk of crisis-driven unrest in [LOC Russia  ] remains low and is likely to remain so , at least through the summer . 
Public opinion surveys show an up-tick in dissatisfaction with the country 's general direction , but with no indication that the darkening mood signals an increased tendency for protest or other signs of active discontent . 
[LOC Moscow  ] 's top sociologists point to deep wellsprings of trust in [LOC Putin  ] , successes in the government 's efforts to limit layoffs , and the [MISC Russian  ] " psyche " of perseverance as explanation for their predictions of relative social stability over the coming months . 
Some argue with justification that society has yet to feel the full effect of the economic crisis . 
They predict a moment of truth next fall , when unemployed ( or underemployed ) [MISC Russians  ] return from their summer dachas to face continued deprivations and expected cutbacks in government benefits and support . 
End Summary . 
The Public Mood: Darkening but Not Black ---------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [LOC Russia  ] 's top three polling firms offer a consistent picture of a society adjusting to the reality of economic crisis ; an increase in general dissatisfaction about the course of events ; but general social stability . 
[PER Ludmilla Presnyakova  ] of the Fund for Public Opinion ( [ORG FOM  ] ) provided data from a February 14-15 survey that showed 58 percent of respondents considered [LOC Russia  ] " in crisis " -- up from 31 percent in late January -- and 34 percent expected the crisis to last at least a year . 
The state-controlled [ORG VTsIOM  ] company reported that the number or those who were strongly disturbed by the economic crisis had increased from 40 percent in January to 56 percent in February . 
Further , [ORG VTsIOM  ] surveys found a sharp increase in the number of respondents concerned about unemployment from 25 percent last year to 61 percent in February. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Already , economic issues are having a negative impact on the political arena . 
[ORG Levada Center  ] polling for February showed a continued downturn in public perceptions about the direction of the country , with 40 percent of respondents saying they considered the country moving in the wrong direction . 
This compares with only 25 percent in June and 30 percent in November . 
The economic crisis has also made a slight dent in [LOC Putin  ] 's personal popularity according to [ORG Levada  ] polls , with one-fifth of the population not approving and about 80 percent supporting the Premier . 
[PER Medvedev  ] 's ratings are seen as a derivative of [LOC Putin  ] 's and have likewise dipped in recent weeks . 
More telling , public approval of the government ( separate from the personalities of the leadership ) has fallen to only 54 percent ; 43 percent disapproved. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Taken in perspective , however , [ORG Levada  ] data over the eight years of the [LOC Putin  ] era shows long-standing [MISC Russian  ] skepticism about the government and more measured , though positive , assessments of [LOC Putin  ] . 
For most of the period from 1999 to 2007 , the majority of [MISC Russians  ] disapproved of their government 's work , sometimes with as much as a negative 40 percent approval index ( the difference between those who approved vice those who disapproved ) . 
[LOC Putin  ] 's approval index has enjoyed positive numbers , but varied from less than 40 percent in 2004-2005 to a peak of 80 percent at the time of the war in [LOC Georgia  ] . 
[ORG Levada  ] 's numbers suggest that the slide in public opinion thus far has merely reflected a decrease from unusually high ratings over the past two years. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Despite the crisis , [ORG FOM  ] surveys found little change in respondents' inclination to take part in protest activities: from 2005 to the present , the number of those who would consider the possibility has been stable at around 30 percent of the population , with fluctuations within the 3 percent margin of error . 
Even among the unemployed , only 35 percent said they would consider joining a protest action , compared to 28 percent among the population writ large . 
Is [LOC Russia  ] Revolutionary ? ------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Many in the political sphere share the sociologists' skepticism about the potential for social unrest over the short to medium term . 
Economist [PER Evgeniy Gontmakher  ] of the [ORG Medvedev-linked Institute of Contemporary Development  ] waved off suggestions that crisis-linked dissatisfaction would lead to social upheaval and a threat to the current order . 
Despite having published a provocative article hypothesizing a political crisis emerging from the government 's failure to deal with a localized protest , he argued to us that [MISC Russians  ] remain apolitical , apathetic , and waiting for the government to take action . 
Further , [LOC Russia  ] 's immense size and diversity [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00000512 002 OF 002 are potent roadblocks to the emergence of a nationwide protest movement , leaving [PER Gontmakher  ] ambivalent about the risks that economic crisis in and of itself will engender revolution from below. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Rostislav Turovksiy  ] of the [ORG Center for Political Technologies  ] likewise argued that the current system has deep wellsprings of social support . 
Echoing [PER Gontmakher  ] , he told us that [LOC Russia  ] 's populace remains deeply conservative and influenced by the government 's propaganda machine , which he claimed would never permit programming that cast blame on government policies for the economic crisis . 
[PER Andrey Kortunov  ] of the [ORG Eurasia Foundation  ] agreed , noting that the [MISC Russian  ] leadership retained significant carrots and sticks ; culturally , he argued , there would also be an initial willingness to trust the leadership , particularly [LOC Putin  ] , by a populace woefully uninformed about international economics. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) A few of our contacts , however , are less sanguine and see the potential for mass social unrest growing , with the risk increasing sharply in the fall . 
[PER Valeriy Solovei  ] of the [ORG Gorbachev Foundation  ] said his main concern was for the middle class , which he considered about 25 percent of the population . 
The poorer lower class ( estimated at 70% of the population ) " had nothing to lose " and would survive economic hardship by digging their potatoes and drinking the days away . 
[PER Oleg Voronin  ] agreed , noting that much of [MISC Russian  ] society would spend the summer at the dacha , with only some sporadic protests of office workers ( perhaps in [LOC Moscow  ] ) and some blue collar demonstrations like the coal miners blockade of the main [MISC Siberian  ] rail lines . 
Next fall , however , when the [MISC Russian  ] government eventually runs out of cash , economic tensions will rise and give rise to more public displays of discontent. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Presnyakova  ] sees some logic in the scenario painted by the " pessimists " [PER Solovei  ] and [PER Voronin  ] . 
She cited research that most [MISC Russians  ] have sufficient resources to last four to six months during a crisis , allowing those who have lost their jobs in 2009 to last through summer . 
Moreover , she said that up to half of all [MISC Russian  ] families have a dacha plot where they could grow food supplies for a difficult year . 
Moreover , in a February [ORG FOM  ] poll only 1 percent of respondents cited unemployment ( being laid off ) as the personal impact of the crisis vice a quarter who suffered pay delays or the 33 percent who cited a reduction in pay or a loss of a bonus . 
[PER Presnyakova  ] assessed that this reflected the success of government pressure on firms to limit unemployment . 
As the crisis deepens and the government draws down its reserves , such measures to limit layoffs are likely to diminish sharply . 
Assessments of how [MISC Russian  ] society will react to those coming changes are mixed . 
Comment ------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) It is difficult to predict the course of events in a country as large and differentiated as [LOC Russia  ] , especially given the uncertainties of the global economic crisis . 
We are inclined to the view that [LOC Russia  ] will maintain socio-political stability through the summer , albeit with the recognition that localized demonstrations of protest are possible throughout the country , particularly in the " one company towns . 
" Without a viable political alternative and the tandem 's control over mass media , the likelihood that economic discontent can evolve into a political movement remains low . 
However , as we will discuss septel , the greater risk to socio-political stability is that of inter- and intra-elite conflict , in which one or more of the competing clans seeks to leverage public discontent to gain advantage .
