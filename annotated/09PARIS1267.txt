The [ORG Socialist Party  ] has already announced that it will challenge [ORG Hadopi  ] 2 in front of the [ORG Constitutional Council  ] , notably because they believe the bill 's ordonnance pnale deprives potential offenders of the ability to defend themselves properly .

[MISC French  ] Culture Minister [PER Frederic Mitterrand  ] , who pushed for this bill last summer , stressed that artists would " remember that we had the political courage to finally break the laissez-faire attitude , and to protect their rights from those who want to turn the [MISC Internet  ] into a ground for their libertarian utopia . 
" Last week , [PER Mitterand  ] announced he would submit a bill ( [ORG Hadopi  ] 3 ) to improve online legal offerings by the end of the year . 
" By then , [ORG Hadopi  ] 1 and 2 will be operational , " he said .
