( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Anti-Corruption Unit  ] ( [ORG ACU  ] ) of the [MISC Afghan  ] Attorney General 's Office on January 25 obtained its first conviction since its establishment in April 2009 . 
This marks a milestone for a country internationally criticized for its lax attitude toward endemic corruption and inadequate efforts to combat it . 
[ORG ACU  ] Prosecutor won the case against [PER Mohammad Zakir  ] , an Investigative Prosecutor from the [ORG Eastern Zone of Kabul  ] assigned to work national security cases , who was charged with taking a $400 bribe to drop a criminal case . 
Although the monetary value of the case is small , the case is significant because it marks the first one successfully processed through the new [ORG ACU  ] from investigation , through trial , to conviction. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The defendant was sentenced to six months in prison and a fine equal to the amount of the bribe . 
The Chief Judge of the three-judge panel showed leniency by imposing a sentence six months less than the full year prison term required by law in bribery cases . 
In this case , the judge considered the defendant 's poverty and six children to be mitigating circumstances worthy of sentence reduction . 
The [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Penal Code  ] permits a judge to reduce a sentence in the presence of mitigating circumstances. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG ACU  ] , established to prosecute official corruption cases , is divided into two teams of six prosecutors who are mentored by advisors from the [LOC USG  ] , [LOC UK  ] , and [ORG EUPOL  ] . 
The [ORG ACU  ] currently has 38 active cases .
