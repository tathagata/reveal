( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: Embassy enthusiastically endorses the concept of posting an [ORG FAA  ] attache in [LOC Brazil  ] to provide for a regional [ORG FAA  ] presence in [LOC South America  ] . 
[LOC Bilaterally  ] , such a presence would allow [ORG FAA  ] and [ORG Mission Brazil  ] to work together to assist the [MISC Brazilians  ] in dealing with their air traffic control crisis through greater training and information exchange efforts . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As indicated in reftels , [LOC Brazil  ] has been plagued with a host of air travel issues since the collapse of national carrier Varig in early 2006 . 
The stress on [LOC Brazil  ] 's aviation infrastructure was exacerbated by the mid-air collision between [LOC Gol Flight  ] 1907 and a private plane on September 29 , 2006 , which led to the [LOC Gol  ] jet 's crash and loss of all 154 persons on board . 
Air traffic controllers ( [ORG ATCs  ] ) in [LOC Brazil  ] subsequently enacted a work-to-rule slowdown to better comply with [ORG International Civil Aviation Organization  ] ( [ORG ICAO  ] ) regulations following allegations of potential errors in their operations just prior to the crash , and also to protest their overall working conditions ( as military personnel , [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG ATCs  ] are paid the usual military pay rate depending on their rank , not a skilled-personnel salary such as is paid to [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG ATCs  ] . 
) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Now oft-referred to as a " crisis , " the civil aviation situation shows no imminent signs of improvement , having flared up several times since last year , with particularly onerous flight delays and cancellations during heavily traveled weekends and holiday periods . 
This past weekend , air traffic controllers went on strike , effectively paralyzing air traffic in the country on Friday and Saturday ( septel ) . 
Over the past few years , air travel in [LOC Brazil  ] has increased dramatically , without a corresponding increase in the [ORG GOB  ] 's budget and other resources devoted to aviation infrastructure. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG Mission Brazil  ] enthusiastically supports the idea of posting a regional [ORG FAA  ] attache in-country , either at the Consulate in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] or the Embassy in [LOC Brasilia  ] , to allow for increased cooperation and technical exchange . 
We envision the [ORG FAA Attache  ] as the primary liaison with [ORG GOB  ] civil aviation authorities , working hand in hand with [ORG Mission Brazil  ] 's Military Liaison Office and [ORG Defense Attache Office  ] as long as air traffic control remains the responsibility of the [MISC Brazilian  ] Air Force , in addition to receiving appropriate assistance and support from the CivAir Officer in the [ORG Economic Section  ] for any non-military aviation concerns . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is the largest country in the [LOC Southern Hemisphere  ] , with several airports offering flights from the [LOC U.S  ] . 
( Comment: With the advent of [LOC U.S.  ] carrier flights from [LOC Miami  ] to [LOC Northeast Brazil  ] , planned in the near future , this will bring the number of airports in [LOC Brazil  ] that have flights from [LOC Miami  ] to four , possibly increasing to five airports in short order . 
End Comment . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Despite the issues mentioned , [LOC Sao Paulo  ] still offers fairly ready access to other [LOC Southern Hemisphere  ] cities . 
Posting an attache there would be more cost- and time-effective for regional coverage than having a person in [LOC Miami  ] or farther south in [LOC Buenos Aires  ] or [LOC Santiago  ] , for example . 
In addition , aviation contacts in [LOC Brazil  ] are not centralized in [LOC Brasilia  ] ; although the federal government is based here , the air traffic control function still lies with the military . 
[LOC Sao Paulo  ] offers the ability to conduct business both within [LOC Brazil  ] and externally , and would maximize the [ORG FAA  ] 's budget for regional activities . 
The Ambassador stands ready to assist the establishment of an [ORG FAA  ] presence there. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) In addition , [ORG Mission Brazil  ] would welcome and support the assignment of a TDY person from [ORG FAA  ] prior , or in addition , to the assignment of a longer-term attache , to expedite our aviation cooperation efforts with the [LOC GOB.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG Mission Brazil  ] thanks [ORG FAA  ] 's [ORG Western Hemisphere Office  ] ( [PER Mayte Ashby  ] , [PER Cecilia Capestany  ] , and [PER Tere Franceschi  ] ) for their communication , information and cooperation thus far . 
We are ready to assist [ORG FAA  ] with developing its regional presence .
