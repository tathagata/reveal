( C ) SUMMARY: [LOC Iran  ] 's Green [MISC Path Opposition  ] ( [ORG GPO  ] ) came into being as a result of the fixed June 12 Presidential election . 
What started as a movement to annul the election now gives shelter both to those seeking the full set of rights guaranteed them by [MISC Islamic  ] [LOC Iran  ] 's Constitution and others seeking a new system altogether . 
Although the numbers of those publicly willing to march under its banner have decreased in the face of regime brutality , its current core group , mostly college-age urban youth , have shown no sign of giving up the fight . 
But like the regime that seeks to crush it , the [ORG GPO  ] is not monolithic and there is a clear gulf between the opposition 's elite leadership and the popular movement protesting in the streets . 
Remaining outside the umbrella of the [ORG GPO  ] is an array of unsatisfied groups whose willingness to join the [ORG GPO  ] is unclear . 
These groups clearly oppose President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] but do not yet seek , as do many [ORG GPO  ] elements , to overturn the entire system . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) NOTE: This is the first in a series of three cables examining the [MISC Iranian Opposition  ] since the June 12 Presidential election , what might happen in the short-term , and what the most effective levers of [LOC US  ] policy have been so far and what combination may have the most impact in the coming months. <a id='parI' href='#parI'>¶</a>I . 
BIRTH OF THE [ORG GPO  ] --------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) ELECTION BUILD-UP AND ORIGINS OF THE GREEN PATH OPPOSITION: [LOC Iran  ] 's current unrest began in June 2009 , when [LOC Iran  ] 's lackluster Presidential campaign became energized by a ( first-time ) series of televised debates among the four Presidential candidates: former Prime Minister [PER Mir Hossein Mousavi  ] ( reformist ) , former Speaker [PER Mehdi Karrubi  ] ( reformist ) , [ORG Expediency Council  ] Secretary [PER Mohsen Rezai  ] ( moderate conservative ) and President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] ( hard-line conservative ) . 
President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's accusations that former Presidents [PER Rafsanjani  ] and [PER Khatami  ] were 'plotting' against his government and , along with [PER Mousavi  ] and other reformists , sought to undermine the Revolution and to enrich themselves , galvanized ordinary [MISC Iranians  ] . 
Incivility and accusations at odds with obligatory [MISC Persian  ] politesse left many observers with the impression ( discomforting for some , energizing for others ) that the elections might actually be more of a true contest than past elections , and that [PER Ahmadinejad  ] might actually be vulnerable to an upset. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) These Presidential debates sparked popular interest in the election , and in the last week or so before the June 12 vote reformist candidate [PER Mousavi  ] , with active and behind-the-scenes support from [PER Khatami  ] and [PER Rafsanjani  ] , increasingly gained momentum , with his supporters for the first time beginning to speak publicly of a 'Green [MISC Movement.'  ] 
Part of his support were young , first-time voters ; part were revitalized older 'Second of [MISC Khordad'  ] reformists who had turned out in record number to support [PER Khatami  ] in 1997 and 2001 , but who had subsequently sourced on politics due to [PER Khatami  ] 's inability to effect change . 
Another large group of first-time voters were from the ranks of the " [MISC Khamoush  ] " ( 's ilent' ) - ie , [MISC Iranians  ] who had never voted but who were inspired by prospects for positive change and had hope that this election would be genuine . 
[PER Mousavi  ] may have even drawn some support for older and more conservative voters who remembered his steady stewardship of [LOC Iran  ] 's economy during his stint as Prime Minister during the 1980 's [MISC Iran-Iraq  ] War. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) ELECTION DAY: IRIG elections have never been 'free and fair , ' but until June 2009 most electoral machinations consisted primarily of the conservative [ORG Guardian Council  ] screening out ideologically undesirable candidates , plus vote manipulation at relatively low levels , including using the [ORG Basij  ] to 'get out the vote.' 
Conventional wisdom going into June 12 was that a high turnout -- representing energized young and urban voters -- would favor [PER Mousavi  ] , who would need a few million vote 'cushion' in order [ORG DUBAI  ] 00000013 002 OF 006 to either win outright or to get into a subsequent two-man runoff with [PER Ahmadinejad  ] . 
While we don't know nor might not ever know the real June 12 vote count , it is clear that the turnout was at record high levels and that there was systematic vote count fraud ( if in fact the votes were even counted ) to ensure that [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 'won big' in the first round. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Why the fix ? 
In retrospect , many of the reasons seem clear . 
Part of the answer could relate to [ORG SLK  ] 's desire to have unified control over the three branches of government to strengthen [LOC Iran  ] 's hand , and his hand personally , in expected upcoming negotiations with the [LOC West  ] and the [LOC US  ] over nuclear issues . 
More certainly , part of the answer is that after the 1997-2005 [PER Khatami Presidency  ] , Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] ( [ORG SLK  ] ) was determined to prevent any reformist , especially his former political opponent [PER Mousavi  ] , from heading the [ORG Executive Branch  ] . 
[ORG SLK  ] considers [PER Rafsanjani  ] his most serious rival , and is also intimidated by [PER Khatami  ] 's popularity . 
Therefore , that both [PER Rafsanjani  ] and [PER Khatami  ] supported [PER Mousavi  ] may have led [ORG SLK  ] to conclude that a [PER Mousavi  ] victory would consolidate power in the hands of those bitter rivals and leave him unacceptably vulnerable to marginalization . 
And part of the answer relates to the increasingly powerful [ORG IRGC  ] hardline faction that had supported [PER Ahmadinejad  ] ( [ORG AN  ] ) in 2005 , whose support [ORG AN  ] strengthened over the subsequent four years by using government funds and patronage to increase this faction 's power and wealth . 
As such , this hardline [ORG IRGC  ] faction , composed mostly of high-level officers with a shared intelligence-security background , wanted 'four more years , ' despite mixed support for [ORG AN  ] from within the [ORG IRGC  ] ranks . 
Anecdotal information indicates that this hardline faction had convinced [ORG SLK  ] that the election could be fixed with minimal backlash. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) They were wrong , as shown by the unprecedented sight of millions of ordinary [MISC Iranians  ] pouring into the streets chanting 'where is my vote.' 
On June 19 , [ORG SLK  ] abandoned his carefully cultivated pretense of non-partisanship and took the first steps down the long road of post-election suppression when he lauded the 'epic' June 12 vote and told those disputing the results to stop protesting and fall in line or face the consequences . 
In response , what started as the pre-election 'Green Movement' slowly began changing into the 'Green Path of [MISC Hope' Opposition  ] ( [ORG GPO  ] ) , as reformist leaders [PER Mousavi  ] , [PER Karrubi  ] and [PER Khatami  ] signaled that they would not stand down. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG REGIME RESPONSE: Regime  ] reaction to ongoing post-election [ORG GPO  ] activity was swift , conducted at both the popular and elite level: - At the elite level the regime began a widespread intimidation campaign to include Stalinesque show trials , rounding up not only 'all the usual suspects' ( i.e. first-tier reformists , primarily those associated with [PER Khatami  ] 's 'Second of [MISC Khordad'  ] movement ) , but also their family members , in addition to second-tier reformists , political and human rights activists , and reporters . 
Many if not most of these detained , to include those arrests that garnered the most publicity in the [LOC West  ] , played no significant role in either promoting [PER Mousavi  ] 's candidacy or in engendering post-election protests . 
However anecdotal evidence indicates there have been extensive arrests of younger , lesser-known activists more active in the [ORG GPO  ] . 
Within the regime , [ORG SLK  ] acted quickly to bring into line as many key power brokers as possible , including traditional conservatives like [PER Majlis Speaker Larijani  ] , former [ORG IRGC  ] commander ( and defeated Presidential candidate ) [PER Mohsen Rezai  ] , and [LOC Tehran  ] Mayor Qalibaf - all of whom oppose [PER Ahmadinejad  ] and would have been happy to see him go , but whose loyalty to the System and to the Leader trumped concerns they may have had about the extent of the voting fraud. - At the popular level the regime increasingly resorted to force on those public holidays when [ORG GPO  ] supporters took to the streets . 
The following were the key dates on which the [ORG GPO  ] took to the streets: [ORG DUBAI  ] 00000013 003 OF 006 -- 20 June 2009: The day after [ORG SLK  ] 's gauntlet-throwing Friday Prayer speech saw several hundred thousand [MISC Iranians  ] march in [LOC Tehran  ] to protest , and also witnessed the first significant use of regime force against protestors . 
The killing of one young marcher , [PER Neda Agha Soltani  ] , captured on video , focused global attention on the protests and gave the [ORG GPO  ] a tragic but iconic image of martyrdom to wield against the regime . 
-- June 28 , 2009 ( 7th of Tir ) : The first time the [ORG GPO  ] used the cover of an officially sanctioned ceremony to rally against the government . 
[ORG GPO  ] supporters , led by a key [PER Mousavi aide  ] , caught security forces off guard by taking over an annual ceremony to mark the 1981 bombing that killed several leaders of the Revolution . 
-- July 17 , 2009: The first and only time since June 12 when former President [PER Rafsanjani  ] , in many ways the main target of hardline regime animus , was allowed to give the [LOC Tehran  ] Friday Prayer sermon . 
[PER Rafsanjani  ] 's much anticipated speech , in which he did not acquiesce to the official election results , energized opposition supporters and led to street clashes . 
-- September 18 , 2009 ( [MISC Ghods Day  ] ) : The government-orchestrated event to demonstrate solidarity with [MISC Palestinians  ] was co-opted by hundreds of thousands of [ORG GPO  ] supporters flaunting green and chanting anti-government slogans . 
[MISC Ghods Day  ] was the zenith of the [ORG GPO  ] 's ability to bring significant number to the streets , and the last time when security forces by and large eschewed violence ; -- November 4 , 2009 ( US Embassy Takeover Anniversary ) : The [ORG GPO  ] hoped to replicate [ORG Ghods Day  ] during the first large-scale protest since university campuses reopened . 
Increasingly ominous warnings from the security forces and revelations of detainee abuse resulted in smaller [ORG GPO  ] turnout , and more violent clashes than previously ; -- December 27 , 2009 ( [PER Ashura  ] and 7th [MISC Mourning Day  ] for [MISC Grand Ayatollah  ] Montazeri ) : [PER Ashura  ] witnessed the most violent clashes since June 20 , with at least nine killed . 
Violent clashes also took place in major cities outside of [LOC Tehran  ] . 
II . 
WHERE WE ARE NOW ---------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) WHAT IS THE OPPOSITION: Up to now the [ORG GPO  ] 's most significant tool of resistance is popular turnout in the form of peaceful marching and civil disobedience on those holidays when the regime cannot prevent people taking to the streets . 
However , ongoing regime violence against protesters has decreased [ORG GPO  ] turnout , from the millions of June 15 to a smaller committed core of ( at most ) hundreds of thousands . 
Much if not most of them are young , college-age [MISC Iranians  ] , and understandably the vast majority of opposition turnout appears to have been in [LOC Tehran  ] , although other major urban centers have also seen sporadic unrest . 
Although the number of GPO'ers willing to take to the streets has decreased from the days immediately following the June election , those remaining on the streets seem to have radicalized , with at least some opposition animus from [ORG AN  ] to SLK: the new emblematic chant is no longer 'where is my vote' but 'd eath to the dictator ( i.e . 
[ORG SLK  ] ) .' 
At the elite level , not only are [PER Mousavi  ] , [PER Karrubi  ] and [PER Khatami  ] the focus on hardline regime pressure , but former President [PER Rafsanjani  ] is under ongoing attack by these same forces . 
[ORG DUBAI  ] 00000013 004 OF 006 <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The [ORG GPO  ] has a strong 'brand' - green , freedom , peace signs , silent marches , stolen election and martyrs like [PER Neda Agha Soltani  ] . 
But like the regime that seeks to crush it , the [ORG GPO  ] is not monolithic . 
To characterize the [ORG GPO  ] 's active core as now primarily ( but not exclusively ) university students and university-age youth in a country so demographically young ( for example , approximately one quarter of the population is in its twenties ) is not to belittle its potential . 
Outside of the active [ORG GPO  ] core group there is a larger , relatively passive group , whose support now mostly manifests in the anonymous shouts of 'God is Great' from night-time [ORG North Tehran  ] rooftops or who scrawl or stamp anti-regime slogans on ten thousand [MISC Toman  ] currency notes . 
Presumably many of them have fled the field due to fear of regime reprisal but might be drawn back into the fray if the prospects of a [ORG GPO  ] victory , however defined , became more real to them than the prospect of blows from a [ORG Basiji  ] baton. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) OTHER OPPOSITIONS: Stepping back , it is wrong to assume that the [ORG GPO  ] is the logical equivalent of 'the [MISC Iranian  ] opposition , ' and indeed it is more accurate to speak of many different [MISC Iranian  ] oppositions , each with different constituents and goals , to include the following: - BUREAUCRACY: [ORG AN  ] has effected vast bureaucratic top-down Executive branch personnel changes , ignoring the technocratic cadre that was the recruitment pool for the [PER Rafsanjani  ] and [PER Khatami  ] presidencies . 
Given his preference for ideology over expertise ( 'm ota'hed' versus 'm otakhasses' ) , he has staffed his government largely from within the current and former [ORG IRGC  ] ranks . 
Many of these former ministers , deputy ministers , office heads and other senior bureaucrats have not been pleased with their professional fates . 
At lower government levels , there is anecdotal evidence of widespread disgruntlement with if not opposition to [ORG AN.  ] -MILITARY/INTELLIGENCE: [ORG AN  ] and his hardline [ORG IRGC  ] backers have extensively purged the [ORG Intelligence Ministry  ] on the grounds of partisan loyalty , creating a significant cadre of disgruntled former [ORG Intelligence Ministry  ] officials . 
Similarly , there is evidence of at least some [ORG IRGC  ] opposition , both within the rank and file and also the upper ranks , at [ORG SLK  ] 's handling of the election and post-election events. - INDUSTRIALISTS: [ORG AN  ] 's massive economic mismanagement and the ongoing economic power grab of 'IRGC Incorporated' has engendered much ill will among [LOC Iran  ] 's affluent and influential industrial leaders. - [PER RAFSANJANI/CLERGY: Rafsanjani  ] 's institutional power is minimal , but as part of his strategy he seeks to retain/expand his support within [LOC Iran  ] 's clerical class , although this class itself is increasingly impotent and dependent on government favor . 
As one element of the regime 's efforts to limit the pro-GPO clergy 's influence , it has taken steps in recent weeks to challenge the religious titles and credentials of at least one top-level reformist cleric ( " [MISC Grand Ayatollah  ] " ) . 
This move will not likely endear the regime to many if not most [MISC Iranian  ] traditional seminarians who take matters of religious credentials , learning , and hierarchy very seriously , especially given [ORG SLK  ] 's own lack of qualifications for his religious title. - 'MODERATE' PRINCIPLISTS: Within the ruling conservative 'Principlist' ( 'Osulgarayan' ) grouping there is a significant faction opposing [ORG AN  ] , though still quite loyal to [ORG SLK  ] and the concept of 'Supreme [PER Jurisconsulate.'  ] 
One of this faction 's leaders is [ORG Majlis  ] Speaker [PER Ali Larijani  ] , with the [ORG Majlis  ] as a whole in an ongoing battle with [ORG AN  ] 's increasingly 'imperial' Executive Branch . 
Other major Principlist opponents are [LOC Tehran  ] Mayor [PER Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf  ] and [ORG Expediency Council  ] Secretary [PER Mohsen Rezai  ] . 
[ORG DUBAI  ] 00000013 005 OF 006 [ORG GPO  ] LEADERSHIP- STREET --------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The [ORG GPO  ] has promulgated a new mode of oppositionist organization for [LOC Iran  ] . 
Anecdotal evidence indicates that [ORG GPO  ] leaders , especially [PER Mousavi  ] , have from the start favored a horizontal , diffuse , decentralized [ORG GPO  ] structure as opposed to a more hierarchical one . 
Indeed , part of the [ORG GPO  ] 's resilience stems from this defuse and decentralized nature , frustrating a regime that has come to rely on the two-step of identifying and decapitating leadership as its main tool for extinguishing dissent . 
In this regard communication technologies such as the [MISC Internet  ] and SMS technology have been a significant 'force multiplier , ' with virtual space in many ways playing the same 'information-center' role now that the networks of mosques played in the 1979 Revolution . 
[ORG GPO  ] leaders [PER Karrubi  ] , [PER Mousavi  ] and [PER Khatami  ] play a role both symbolic and also operational , with anecdotal evidence indicating that they are playing at least a limited role in coordinating with if not leading the [ORG GPO  ] masses . 
Additionally , for the first time since the Revolution elements of the [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Diaspora  ] seem to be playing a role within events in [LOC Iran  ] , coordinating with [ORG GPO  ] leadership elements inside the country. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Distance between the titular [ORG GPO  ] leadership and the street may yield tactical advantages , though it also reflects a gulf between the leadership and the popular opposition . 
[PER Mousavi  ] , [PER Karrubi  ] , and [PER Khatami  ] are longstanding fixtures of the [LOC Islamic Republic  ] , making them ill suited to lead a radicalizing movement calling for the overthrow of that system . 
Certainly they retain support from the broader opposition , but many , and particularly the more radicalized elements , do not look to [PER Mousavi  ] et al for leadership . 
In particular , IRPO contacts in their 20s and 30s discount the notion that anyone previously associated with 'the [PER Nezam'  ] ( 'the System' ) could accurately represent their interests and aspirations . 
The regime , however , has proved particularly effective at neutralizing emerging leaders from the post-Revolution generations. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Within the [ORG GPO  ] there is no consensus on its goals . 
What started as a movement merely to annul the election results now gives shelter both to those seeking the full set of rights guaranteed them by [MISC Islamic  ] [LOC Iran  ] 's Constitution and others seeking a new system of governance altogether . 
Much like the ambiguity in its leadership , the unspecified nature of its goals allow it to have a 'bigger tent.' 
[PER Mousavi  ] 's recent five point declaration calling for restoring press freedom , creating a fair and transparent election law , freeing all political prisoners , and recognizing the peoples' right to gather and to form political associations and parties , was however an attempt by the [ORG GPO  ] leaderships to to begin to delimit the scope of their ambitions. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Heretofore the [ORG GPO  ] has yet to adopt any sort of an economic agenda or set of grievances as part of a core opposition message , and perhaps the absence of one partially underscores the relative 'bourgeois' leanings of the [ORG GPO  ] . 
Anecdotal information indicates that unemployment and a potential spike in inflation ( expected with the recent decision to end subsidies ) increasingly concern a large number of [MISC Iranians  ] . 
IRPO contacts and [MISC Iranian  ] press reporting also indicate another spike in labor unrest , due to the parlous state of [LOC Iran  ] 's factories and their inability to pay their workers on time . 
One would think that a message that capitalizes on these economic concerns juxtaposed against President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's ( and by extension the Revolution 's ) economic mismanagement and continued corruption would attract a wide spectrum of socio-economic groups to a more broad-based [ORG GPO  ] . 
However , for whatever reason , in contemporary [LOC Iran  ] it has been political and not economic themes that have been more effective in mobilizing the [MISC Iranian  ] people , and economic concerns on their own have rarely drawn large protests in [LOC Iran  ] 's thirty-year post-revolutionary history . 
[ORG DUBAI  ] 00000013 006 OF 006 <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( U ) COMMENT: The June 12 election and its subsequent protests/crackdown was a tectonic shift in [MISC Iranian  ] domestic politics . 
At the elite level it destroyed [PER Khamenei  ] 's non-partisan veneer , placing him securely in the center of a no holds-barred political fray . 
It also redefined the sets of insider ( 'khodi' ) and outsider ( 'qeyr-e khodi' ) so that not only were Second of [MISC Khordad Reformists  ] on the outs , but so was former President [PER Hashemi Rafsanjani  ] and those aligned with him . 
In this regard , at the elite level the central dynamic in many ways can be seen as Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] , [ORG AN  ] and the hard-line intelligence-security [ORG IRGC  ] faction on one side and former President [PER Rafsanjani  ] on the other , with all of [LOC Iran  ] 's political elite being pressured to openly take sides ( NOTE: there is a substantial economic element to this dynamic , as in many ways [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's ascension to power coincides with attempts by a new cohort elite , largely composed of hardline [ORG IRGC  ] 'intelligence-security' elements , to secure positions of wealth and influence formerly occupied by [PER Rafsanjani  ] loyalists ) . 
Certainly many hardline regime elements see [PER Rafsanjani  ] and his eldest son [PER Mehdi  ] as the 'head' to the [ORG GPO  ] 'body , ' and assume that if [PER Rafsanjani  ] were neutralized then the [ORG GPO  ] 's threat potential would be far less. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) COMMENT ( CONT ) : According to IRPO contacts close to the [PER Rafsanjani  ] circle , [PER Rafsanjani  ] is still unsuccessfully seeking to persuade Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] that [ORG AN  ] and his crowd are a far greater threat to the [LOC Islamic Republic  ] than any threat that [PER Khamenei  ] might feel from [PER Rafsanjani  ] , and that SLK should withdraw his support for them . 
For their part , the regime continues to pressure [PER Rafsanjani  ] through ( inter alia ) judicial and other pressure on his family , such that his eldest son [PER Mehdi  ] has fled abroad and cannot return . 
A weakened [PER Rafsanjani  ] has minimal institutional power , given that the [ORG Expediency Council  ] is subordinate to [PER Khamenei  ] and that the clerics in the [ORG Experts Council  ] are too cowed or beholden to the government to oppose them . 
As such , [PER Rafsanjani  ] keeps a low public profile while at the same time trying to rally elite support , to include moderate conservatives and influential [ORG IRGC  ] commanders . 
The regime is unlikely to more directly target [PER Rafsanjani  ] unless and until [PER Rafsanjani  ] were to become more confrontational. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) COMMENT ( CONT ) : At the popular level , June 12 has revived a popular reformist movement largely quiescent after the eight [PER Khatami  ] years while also bringing large parts of [LOC Iran  ] 's youngest generation into the fray . 
This opposition , however , is not unified . 
The [ORG GPO  ] now is a bifurcated movement , coupling a largely student-dominated mass following with a titular , elite leadership , and the two parts are not a cohesive whole . 
This rather diffuse organization may be a key to its staying power and simultaneously an impediment to building an opposition movement that could challenge the viability of the current government . 
Beyond the [ORG GPO  ] is an array of unsatisfied groups whose willingness to join the [ORG GPO  ] is unclear . 
These groups clearly oppose President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] but do not yet seek , as do many [ORG GPO  ] elements , to overturn the entire system . 
END COMMENT .
