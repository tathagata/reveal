[ORG HOTR WASHINGTON DC//USDAO PARIS  ] ( SUBJ: [ORG IIR  ] 6 832 0626 08 ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: [LOC France  ] 's new [LOC Africa  ] policy may have its most immediate impact on [LOC France  ] 's military presence in [LOC Africa  ] . 
The [MISC French  ] are planning to consolidate their military presence and want to orient it towards cooperation with [LOC Africa  ] 's sub-regional groupings ( e.g. , [ORG ECOWAS  ] , [ORG SADC  ] , et al . 
) and away from bilateral efforts . 
They foresee their military presence coalescing into two hubs , one on the [LOC Atlantic Ocean  ] ( [LOC Senegal  ] or [LOC Gabon  ] ) and one on the [LOC Indian Ocean  ] ( [LOC Djibouti  ] or [MISC French  ] overseas department [ORG Reunion Island  ] ) . 
Even these bases may eventually disappear if [MISC Africans  ] prove capable of maintaining peace and security . 
Another priority will be the renegotiation of [LOC France  ] 's [ORG Defense Agreements  ] with eight [MISC African  ] countries , which now feature outdated provisions from the colonial era . 
The [MISC French  ] announced in June 2008 the set of priorities that will henceforth frame [MISC French  ] economic assistance to [LOC Africa  ] . 
The [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] is creating a fourth " sous-direction " ( akin to a [ORG Department Office  ] ) that will more closely match [LOC Africa  ] 's sub-regional groups , and may also reconfigure [MISC French  ] Embassies in [LOC Africa  ] on a large , medium , and small basis to align priorities with budget constraints . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Part I of this series ( ref A ) described the " [MISC France-Afrique  ] " model that governed [LOC France  ] 's relations with sub-Saharan [LOC Africa  ] for most of the 20th century . 
Even before taking office in May 2007 , President [PER Nicolas Sarkozy  ] believed that relations needed revision in response to globalization , changing circumstances , and the waning of the colonial and immediate post-colonial periods . 
He sought a more modern and transparent relationship , ostensibly of " equals , " that would allow both sides to conduct relations on a business-like and rational basis . 
Part II ( ref B ) discussed [LOC France  ] 's first steps ( and missteps ) in implementing this policy and [MISC African  ] reactions to it . 
This message ( Part III ) focuses on [LOC France  ] 's military presence in [LOC Africa  ] and organizational changes likely to occur in conjunction with [LOC France  ] 's new policy . 
Post welcomes comments from colleagues at [LOC U.S.  ] missions in [LOC Africa  ] . 
The Bases --------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [LOC France  ] has long maintained five permanent military bases with responsibility for [LOC Africa  ] -- in [LOC Cote  ] d'Ivoire [LOC Djibouti  ] , [LOC Gabon  ] , [LOC Senegal  ] , and on [ORG Reunion Island  ] , the [MISC French  ] overseas department near [LOC Madagascar  ] . 
There is a de facto sixth " base " consisting of the long-term operational deployment in [LOC Chad  ] ( [MISC Operation Epervier  ] , in [LOC Chad  ] since 1986 ) . 
Basing issues in the four continental [MISC African  ] states ( [LOC Cote  ] d'Ivoire [LOC Djibouti  ] , [LOC Gabon  ] , and [LOC Senegal  ] ) are governed by bilateral [ORG Defense Agreements  ] ( see below ) , which include certain provisions obligating [LOC France  ] to defend those states from external aggression. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [LOC COTE  ] D'IVOIRE The status of the [MISC French  ] base remains in doubt given the instability in [LOC Cote  ] d'Ivoire and its distinctly anti-French overtones . 
The [MISC French  ] have stated that they would not remain in places where they were not wanted , and [LOC Cote  ] d'Ivoire President [PER Gbagbo  ] has indicated that he would not oppose a [MISC French  ] departure . 
Prior to the 2002 conflict that divided the country , [LOC France  ] 's military presence consisted of about 550 troops . 
Once the current crisis began , the [MISC French  ] augmented their presence in the form of [MISC Operation Licorne  ] ( presently about 1,880 troops ) , which is working to support the [MISC UNOCI  ] peacekeeping mission. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [MISC Operation Licorne  ] has in effect subsumed [LOC France  ] 's " permanent " presence in [LOC Cote  ] d'Ivoire [ORG Presidential Advisor PARIS  ] 00001698 002 OF 009 [PER Romain Serman  ] in June told Ambassador [PER Mary Yates  ] ( [ORG AFRICOM  ] ) that the [MISC French  ] military relationship with [LOC Cote  ] d'Ivoire would never be the same , and that [LOC France  ] 's contingent , excluding forces associated with [MISC Operation Licorne  ] , was already being treated as a de facto " operational deployment " rather than a permanent garrison . 
( See refs D and E for the [MISC French  ] Presidency 's views on [LOC France  ] 's [LOC Africa  ] policy as expressed to Ambassador [PER Yates  ] and DASD [PER Theresa Whelan  ] in June 2008 . 
) If elections occur successfully in [LOC Cote  ] d'Ivoire in 2008 and [MISC UNOCI  ] and [MISC Operation Licorne  ] then disband , we expect that [LOC France  ] 's military presence will shrink quickly , with a possible [MISC French  ] decision to end basing altogether in [LOC Cote  ] d'Ivoire <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) DJIBOUTI: The base in [LOC Djibouti  ] is [LOC France  ] 's largest in [LOC Africa  ] , with about 2,950 troops that can operate at sea , on land , and in the air . 
These forces use two installations ( in the city of [LOC Djibouti  ] and in [LOC Arta  ] ) and include two infantry regiments , a helicopter battalion , [ORG Army Special Forces  ] , marine commandos , and a naval element . 
The [MISC Bouffard  ] military hospital is the only [ORG Level III  ] military medical facility in the region and treated survivors of the [PER USS Cole  ] terrorist attack . 
[ORG French Forces  ] in [LOC Djibouti  ] ( [ORG FFDJ  ] ) serve primarily to support the bilateral [ORG Defense Agreement  ] . 
[LOC France  ] provided intelligence and logistical and medical support to [MISC Djiboutian  ] forces as recently as July 2008 during [LOC Djibouti  ] 's border dispute with [LOC Eritrea  ] . 
Additionally , the base serves as a pre-positioning point for intervention in the [LOC Middle East  ] as well as in [LOC Africa  ] . 
Ref B describes strains in the [MISC France-Djibouti  ] relationship ( largely over the [PER Borrel  ] case ) . 
The future of the [MISC French  ] presence in [LOC Djibouti  ] may be affected by the base the [MISC French  ] intend to establish in the [LOC UAE  ] per the agreement the two sides signed on January 15 , 2008 . 
It seems unlikely that the [MISC French  ] would maintain two bases in close proximity whose functions would be somewhat redundant. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [MISC GABON:  ] The [MISC French  ] base in [LOC Libreville  ] currently numbers about 800 troops , including an air element ( two [MISC C130s  ] and one helicopter ) , and a [ORG helicopter-equipped Special Forces  ] unit . 
Two parachute companies stationed in [LOC Gabon  ] were sent to [LOC Chad  ] during the February 2008 rebel incursion. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) SENEGAL: The [MISC French  ] base in [LOC Dakar  ] numbers about 1160 troops , with one infantry battalion and air and naval units . 
A [ORG Defense Ministry  ] official says that the [MISC French  ] garrison in [LOC Senegal  ] is much less operationally oriented than the base in [LOC Gabon  ] , remarking that , of the [MISC French  ] bases in [LOC Africa  ] , the one in [LOC Senegal  ] most closely resembles a " holdover from the colonial era . 
" <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) REUNION ISLAND: This overseas department is the home base for about 4,575 [MISC French  ] troops and sailors with air , land , and sea capabilities . 
The main units are the 2nd [ORG Marine Parachute Infantry Regiment  ] , two surveillance frigates , two [MISC P400  ] patrol boats , and a number of aircraft . 
[ORG Reunion Island  ] is responsible not only for portions of eastern and southern [LOC Africa  ] but also for [LOC France  ] 's [LOC Indian Ocean  ] interests . 
It is the home port for the [MISC French  ] naval command [MISC ALINDIEN.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [MISC CHAD:  ] The [MISC French  ] have deployed [MISC Operation Epervier  ] on a " temporary " basis since 1986 , in response to [MISC Libyan  ] provocation in the region . 
Given its longevity , it has become a de facto permanent base but has not been accorded that status . 
The [MISC French  ] military presence has provided support to the Deby regime and also to the Bozize regime in [LOC C.A.R.  ] , in some cases involving combat operations against rebel groups . 
Combat support has , in theory , ceased under President [PER Sarkozy  ] , who has ordered , as part of his policy of " equal partnership " between [LOC France  ] and [LOC Africa  ] , that [MISC French  ] troops " would no longer fire on [MISC Africans  ] " ( except , obviously , in self-defense ) , an order that the [MISC French  ] claim they scrupulously obeyed even during the heavy fighting in [LOC Chad  ] in February 2008 . 
The [MISC French  ] provided essential support to [LOC PARIS  ] 00001698 003 OF 009 [MISC Americans  ] ( both official and unofficial ) in [LOC Chad  ] during the February rebel incursion. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) About 1260 troops now serve in [MISC Operation Epervier  ] ( one [ORG Army Task Force  ] with four infantry companies , six [PER Mirage F1s  ] , four [ORG Puma Helicopters  ] , one [MISC C135  ] refueler , and three [MISC C160  ] transport aircraft ) . 
Another 1675 [MISC French  ] troops participate in [ORG EUFOR  ] , the [ORG EU  ] peacekeeping operation deployed in [LOC Chad  ] and [LOC C.A.R.  ] , largely through [LOC France  ] 's initiative , to support MINURCAT , the [ORG UN  ] operation to help [ORG Darfur  ] refugees and others displaced by the region 's instability . 
The [MISC French  ] hope that [ORG EUFOR  ] will be replaced by a [ORG UN  ] operation , perhaps an expanded MINURCAT , when [ORG EUFOR  ] 's mandate expires in March 2009. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) We expect that the [MISC French  ] will continue to deploy [MISC Operation Epervier  ] in [LOC Chad  ] , irrespective of the [ORG EUFOR  ] mission , so long as instability emanating from [ORG Darfur  ] remains a serious concern . 
Several [MISC French  ] officials have stated privately that [LOC France  ] would like to see the [MISC Chad-Sudan  ] frontier serve as a breakwater , if not a wall , that would impede the spread of radical [MISC Islam  ] from the [ORG Horn of Africa  ] westward and southward into [LOC Africa  ] 's interior . 
That said , the [MISC French  ] may drawdown or end [MISC Operation Epervier  ] as soon as an acceptable level of regional stability is achieved. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) OTHER DEPLOYMENTS: The [MISC French  ] maintain a permanent naval mission in the [LOC Gulf  ] of [LOC Guinea  ] , [LOC Operation Corymbe  ] , usually with two ships on patrol , that enables rapid crisis response , protection for [MISC French  ] off-shore oil interests , and support for NEOs and ongoing peacekeeping operations . 
This naval mission cooperates extensively with [ORG US NAVEUR  ] 's [ORG Africa Partnership Station  ] . 
In addition , the [MISC French  ] have deployed military forces on an ad hoc basis elsewhere in [LOC Africa  ] . 
For example , [MISC French  ] military units have deployed to [LOC Togo  ] to support [MISC Operation Licorne  ] in [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] and [MISC French  ] forces have recently served in multinational operations in the [LOC DRC  ] and [LOC Rwanda  ] , generally under [ORG UN  ] mandate . 
In total , and excluding [MISC French  ] forces stationed on [ORG Reunion Island  ] , there are roughly 10,000 [MISC French  ] troops either garrisoned or deployed in [LOC sub-Saharan Africa  ] . 
Realignment ----------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Well before [PER Sarkozy  ] 's announcement of a new [ORG French Africa  ] policy , [MISC French  ] officials told us that [LOC France  ] wanted to re-orient its military presence away from bilateral relationships and towards increased cooperation with [LOC Africa  ] 's sub-regional groupings . 
This shift would allow [LOC France  ] to treat its military relations with [LOC Africa  ] on a broader basis and not through a series of narrow bilateral relationships each with its own peculiarities and history. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) In 2006 ( i.e. , before [PER Sarkozy  ] 's election in 2007 ) , the [MISC French  ] began implementing a new command structure in [LOC Africa  ] featuring four geographic commands , each of which would generally conform to an analogous regional sub-grouping . 
Notably , [PER Cote  ] d'Ivoire was dropped from this scheme . 
Given the regional ( vice bilateral ) focus of the new commands , the orientation of the new commands may allow more ready interaction and cooperation with the [ORG USG  ] 's new AFRICOM , once the later becomes more present and operational in [LOC Africa  ] . 
-- [ORG French Forces  ] in [LOC Djibouti  ] ( FFDJ ) : Responsible for [LOC Djibouti  ] , [LOC Eritrea  ] , [LOC Ethiopia  ] , [LOC Somalia  ] , [LOC Kenya  ] , [LOC Sudan  ] , and [LOC Uganda  ] , or , roughly , the [ORG IGAD  ] countries . 
-- [ORG French Forces  ] in [LOC Cape Verde  ] ( FFCV ) : Despite its name , a command located in [LOC Senegal  ] responsible for [LOC Senegal  ] , [LOC Cape Verde  ] , [LOC Gambia  ] , [LOC Mauritania  ] , [LOC Mali  ] , [LOC Niger  ] , [LOC Nigeria  ] , [LOC Burkina Faso  ] , [LOC Benin  ] , [LOC Togo  ] , [LOC Ghana  ] , [PER Cote  ] d'Ivoire [LOC Liberia  ] , [LOC Sierra Leone  ] , and [LOC Guinea  ] , roughly paralleling [ORG ECOWAS  ] . 
-- [ORG French Forces  ] in [LOC Gabon  ] ( FFG ) : Responsible for [LOC Gabon  ] , [LOC PARIS  ] 00001698 004 OF 009 [LOC Chad  ] , [LOC C.A.R.  ] , [LOC Cameroon  ] , [LOC Equatorial Guinea  ] , [LOC DRC  ] , [LOC Congo  ] [ORG Brazzaville  ] , and [LOC Angola  ] , corresponding with [ORG ECCAS  ] . 
-- [ORG Armed Forces  ] in the [ORG Southern Zone of the Indian Ocean  ] ( FAZSOI ) : Located on [ORG Reunion Island  ] and responsible for [LOC Rwanda  ] , [LOC Burundi  ] , [LOC Tanzania  ] , [LOC Malawi  ] , [LOC Zambia  ] , [LOC Zimbabwe  ] , [LOC Mozambique  ] , [LOC Botswana  ] , [LOC Namibia  ] , [LOC Swaziland  ] , [LOC Lesotho  ] , [LOC South Africa  ] , and [LOC Madagascar  ] , mirroring [ORG SADC  ] . 
Further Consolidation . . . and Departure ( ? ) ------------------------ <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) Establishing the four commands appears to be only the first step in [LOC France  ] 's plan to consolidate and centralize its military presence in [LOC Africa  ] . 
Consistent with the [ORG White Papers  ] on [ORG Defense  ] and on Foreign Policy issued in June-July 2008 , the [MISC French  ] tell us that they envision an eventual configuration with two hubs that would serve as crisis response centers and headquarters . 
From these hubs , the [MISC French  ] would direct their bilateral and regional military cooperation programs , which would center on supporting and training [MISC African  ] forces that would in turn perform stability operations until now largely performed by the [MISC French  ] and other non-Africans . 
The two [ORG White Papers  ] generally call for a streamlining of [MISC French  ] diplomatic and military operations worldwide , with an emphasis on efficiency , the elimination of redundancies , and greater rationality in the apportionment of ever-decreasing resources. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) Concerning [LOC Africa  ] , the [ORG Defense White Paper  ] states: " [LOC France  ] will conserve a capacity for conflict prevention and for action on the western and eastern sides of the [MISC African  ] continent , as well as in the [LOC Sahel  ] region , notably for combating illicit trafficking and terrorist acts . 
[LOC France  ] will radically convert the present system of defense agreements and military cooperation agreements ( see below ) in order to evolve towards a partnership between [LOC Europe  ] and [LOC Africa  ] and towards cooperation on defense and security , favoring the rise in strength of [MISC African  ] capacities to carry out peacekeeping . 
" <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [PER Sarkozy  ] 's [ORG Africa Advisors  ] ( [ORG Deputy Diplomatic Advisor Bruno Joubert  ] and [PER Romain Serman  ] ) have told us that the [ORG Defense White Paper  ] was deliberately vague in defining these " hubs " in order to avoid the suggestion that [LOC France  ] intended to stay forever in [LOC Africa  ] , a suggestion that would contradict one of [PER Sarkozy  ] 's statements about [LOC France  ] 's not having a mandate to provide for [LOC Africa  ] 's stability indefinitely . 
( See refs C and D . 
) Indeed , Foreign Minister [PER Kouchner  ] has publicly stated that in perhaps 15 years there may not be a [MISC French  ] military presence in [LOC Africa  ] , and [PER Joubert  ] says that even as early as 2012 , if the [ORG AU  ] 's standby force becomes fully operational , it may be possible to reduce or even close some of [LOC France  ] 's [MISC African  ] bases. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) The scenario involving a large-scale , near-term [MISC French  ] military withdrawal from [LOC Africa  ] , however , remains speculative . 
For now , the [MISC French  ] are looking at [LOC Senegal  ] or [LOC Gabon  ] as the possible western hub and [LOC Djibouti  ] as the eastern hub ( assuming that [LOC Djibouti  ] is not closed in deference to the new base in the [LOC UAE  ] ) . 
[PER Joubert  ] and [PER Serman  ] indicate that the [MISC French  ] military prefers [LOC Senegal  ] because of its proximity to [LOC France  ] , the long [MISC French  ] presence there , and [LOC Senegal  ] 's generally stable political environment . 
However , [PER Joubert  ] and [PER Serman  ] believe [LOC Gabon  ] may be a better hub because of its more central location and proximity to the [LOC Gulf  ] of [LOC Guinea  ] and [LOC Africa  ] 's troubled interior . 
[PER Joubert  ] has said that if [LOC Djibouti  ] could no longer serve as a hub , [ORG Reunion Island  ] could assume that function. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) [PER Serman  ] notes that another reason for reducing [LOC France  ] 's military presence in [LOC Africa  ] is to meet domestic political expectations . 
The [ORG GOF  ] recently announced the [LOC PARIS  ] 00001698 005 OF 009 closure of several military facilities in [LOC France  ] , to the dismay of localities dependent on the revenue associated with the facilities . 
The [PER Sarkozy  ] government could not close domestic installations without also making reductions in [LOC France  ] 's overseas presence , [PER Serman  ] observes . 
[ORG Defense Agreements  ] ------------------ <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) [PER Sarkozy  ] announced many of aspects of [LOC France  ] 's [LOC Africa  ] policy in his speech in [LOC Cape Town  ] on February 28 , 2008 ( see refs A and B ) . 
Among these was [LOC France  ] 's intention to renegotiate all eight of its [ORG Defense Agreements  ] in [LOC Africa  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] said that: " [LOC Africa  ] should take charge of its security problems... . 
[LOC France  ] 's military presence in [LOC Africa  ] still rests on the agreements concluded 'the day after' colonization , more than 50 years ago... . 
It 's not a question of [LOC France  ] 's disengaging militarily from [LOC Africa  ] but rather that [LOC Africa  ] 's security is first of all , naturally , the business of [MISC Africans  ] . 
" These agreements should be " adapted to the realities of the present time... . 
Contrary to past practice , " the renegotiated agreements " will be entirely public . 
" <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) [MISC French  ] officials tell us that the eight [ORG Defense Agreements  ] are simply obsolete . 
The Agreements are with [PER Cote  ] d'Ivoire ( 1960 ) , [LOC C.A.R  ] . 
( 1960 ) , [LOC Djibouti  ] ( 1977 ) , [LOC Gabon  ] ( 1960 ) , [LOC Senegal  ] ( 1960 , revised 1974 ) , [LOC Cameroon  ] ( 1960 , revised 1974 ) , [LOC Comoros  ] ( 1973 , revised 1978 ) , and [LOC Togo  ] ( 1963 ) . 
[ORG Presidential Advisors Serman  ] and [PER Remi Marechaux  ] say that the Agreements contain mutual defense provisions that are no longer realistic -- " If [LOC France  ] is attacked , are we really going to expect , much less rely on , [LOC Togo  ] to go to war with whoever attacks us ? 
" More troublesome is the obligation placed on [LOC France  ] to defend its treaty partners . 
[PER Serman  ] was quite uncomfortable with the possibility that [LOC Djibouti  ] would invoke its Agreement with [LOC France  ] and demand that [LOC France  ] come to its defense during the recent [MISC Djibouti-Eritrea  ] border skirmish . 
[PER Serman  ] indicated that [LOC France  ] was quick to provide significant rear-area logistical support to [LOC Djibouti  ] in order to avoid a [MISC Djiboutian  ] request to engage in combat per the [MISC Agreement.  ] <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( C ) Equally troublesome and outdated are certain " secret " portions of some of the [ORG Agreements  ] . 
According to [PER Marechaux  ] , the [ORG Defense Agreements  ] with [LOC Cameroon  ] and [LOC Gabon  ] , for example , contain " absurd " provisions obligating [LOC France  ] , upon request , to provide internal security in case of domestic unrest in those countries -- " There is no way we are going to act as an internal security police force at the request of a regime with domestic unrest . 
" [PER Serman  ] says that some of the [MISC Agreements  ] contain " secret " clauses giving [LOC France  ] monopoly rights to exploit natural resources in the countries concerned . 
" This is so ridiculous today that we can only laugh about it . 
Can you imagine us invoking our Agreement with [LOC Togo  ] and ordering [LOC Togo  ] to tell [LOC China  ] to get out of 'our' country ? 
" <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( C ) [MISC French  ] officials say that the renegotiated [MISC Agreements  ] will be stripped of these outdated provisions and " secret " clauses . 
Everything will be open and transparent , with the revised [MISC Agreements  ] reflecting today 's realities and both sides' priorities in terms of shared interests . 
They will also avoid the paternalism inherent in the original [MISC Agreements  ] . 
The [MISC French  ] have already sent negotiating teams to the eight countries and hope to make significant progress in revising them by the end of 2008. <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( C ) [MISC African  ] reaction seems positive , albeit qualified . 
President [PER Wade  ] of [LOC Senegal  ] , according to the press , in July 2008 commented on [MISC French  ] intentions: " It is a very good thing . 
There are protection , agreements in the event of an internal or external threat to a regime . 
These agreements are secret . 
There must be an end to this , things must be clear . 
But some countries need this protection . 
It is a [LOC PARIS  ] 00001698 006 OF 009 factor in deterring opposition movements accustomed to resorting swiftly to violence and weapons . 
If [LOC France  ] withdraws from those countries , we should not be surprised to see oppositionists attacking the government . 
But this is not the case in [LOC Senegal  ] , which has a solid regime and a loyal army . 
I am therefore willing to annul the [ORG Defense Agreement between France and Senegal  ] . 
The other issue is [LOC France  ] 's military bases , including the one in [LOC Dakar  ] . 
This [MISC French  ] presence does not bother me if it is useful to [LOC France  ] . 
But President [PER Sarkozy  ] believes that this base is no longer necessary ( sic ) . 
" <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( U ) Major General [PER Salimou Mohamed Amiri  ] , Army Chief of Staff of the [LOC Comoros  ] , reportedly stated in July 2008 that the [LOC Comoros  ] favored a new military cooperation arrangement with [LOC France  ] in lieu of the present [ORG Defense Agreement  ] , noting that it would be anomalous for the defense of the [LOC Comoros  ] to fall under [LOC France  ] 's authority . 
He expected that military cooperation would take the form of training and exchange programs . 
[ORG Military Cooperation Agreements  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( C ) Indeed , the renegotiated [ORG Defense Agreements  ] will likely resemble the [ORG Military Cooperation Agreements France  ] maintains with some three dozen [MISC African  ] countries . 
The focus of the [ORG Military Cooperation Agreements  ] is training and professionalism . 
[LOC France  ] 's [ORG Directorate for Military and Defense Cooperation  ] ( [ORG DMCD  ] ) supports a staff of about 300 permanent personnel in [LOC Africa  ] who are embedded within [MISC African  ] militaries , in some cases wearing the local uniform . 
[ORG DMCD  ] runs about 150 projects in [LOC Africa  ] featuring support of military schools , technical training , [MISC French  ] language training , armed forces reform and restructuring , equipment maintenance , communications , and infrastructure support . 
[MISC African  ] military personnel attend 35 military schools in [LOC France  ] and there are 14 regional military vocational schools spread across francophone [MISC Africa.  ] <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
( C ) The [MISC French  ] will also likely continue to support the [ORG RECAMP  ] program ( Reinforcing [MISC African  ] Capabilities for Maintaining Peace ) , designed to improve [MISC Africans'  ] peacekeeping capabilities and their ability to participate successfully in multinational peacekeeping . 
The [MISC French  ] have welcomed [LOC U.S.  ] participation in [ORG RECAMP  ] 's activities , and the program seems to mesh well with the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC ACOTA  ] program , which has similar objectives . 
The [MISC French  ] recently integrated the [ORG EU  ] into [ORG RECAMP  ] , which is now formally called [MISC EuroRECAMP  ] , giving an [ORG EU  ] face to the program ( important to the [MISC French  ] in their effort to multilateralize their presence in [LOC Africa  ] ) and providing additional resources for the program. <a id='par29' href='#par29'>¶</a>29 . 
( C ) In sum , [MISC French  ] military objectives in [LOC Africa  ] parallel the non-military aspects of [PER Sarkozy  ] 's [LOC Africa  ] policy in terms of strengthening [MISC African  ] capabilities ; reducing , if not ending , [MISC African  ] dependence on [LOC France  ] ; promoting openness and transparency ; abandoning colonial-era sentiments and " special " treatment ; engaging the [ORG EU  ] and other bodies into [MISC French-led  ] programs ; and identifying and exploiting shared interests and priorities . 
Ancillary benefits would include increased commitment to democratization , meritocracy , professionalism , and self-reliance . 
New Priorities for [ORG Economic Assistance  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par30' href='#par30'>¶</a>30 . 
( C ) New Secretary of [ORG State for Cooperation and Francophonie Alain Joyandet  ] , who replaced [PER Jean-Marie Bockel  ] following [PER Bockel  ] 's dismissal ( see ref B ) , outlined [MISC French  ] economic assistance priorities for [LOC Africa  ] in a June 19 , 2008 speech: -- Strengthening private sector investment in [LOC Africa  ] and support for young [MISC African  ] entrepreneurs ; -- Reinforcing agricultural programs in [LOC Africa  ] on a [LOC PARIS  ] 00001698 007 OF 009 sustainable basis ; -- Expanding the role of women in small business enterprises ; -- Tripling the number of international volunteers in [LOC Africa  ] within four years ; -- Increasing support to [MISC French  ] [ORG NGOs  ] ( " the role of [MISC French  ] [ORG NGOs  ] is too modest when compared to the powerful [MISC Anglo-Saxon  ] and [MISC German  ] organizations " ) ; -- Increased support for education and teaching the [MISC French  ] language ; and -- Modernizing [LOC France  ] 's military cooperation with [LOC Africa  ] , in line with [PER Sarkozy  ] 's February 2008 speech in [LOC Cape Town.  ] <a id='par31' href='#par31'>¶</a>31 . 
( C ) For the past several years , the [MISC French  ] have been using the [ORG Partnership Framework Agreement  ] ( [ORG PFA  ] ) as the umbrella document formalizing [MISC French  ] assistance to a recipient country . 
Formulated during the final years of the [ORG Chirac Presidency  ] , the [ORG PFA  ] has emerged as an efficient way to package [MISC French  ] assistance . 
Each [ORG PFA  ] runs for five years and describes the various projects the two sides will undertake . 
Notably , the sum of money the [MISC French  ] intend to spend is presented as a range , for the [ORG PFA  ] is intended to be a flexible instrument that will allow for changes and refinements during its five-year run . 
The [ORG PFA  ] is usually generated by the [MISC French  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in a partner country , which identifies needs and possible projects . 
The proposal is then sent to [LOC Paris  ] where it is vetted by [ORG Joyandet  ] 's organization and by the [ORG French Development Agency  ] , a separate body that reports to both the [ORG MFA  ] and the [ORG Finance Ministry  ] . 
After being refined and adopted , the [ORG PFA  ] is offered to the recipient country as the starting point for a final mutual decision on how and how much [MISC French  ] aid is to be provided and administered . 
The arrangement seems to be working well and we expect that the priorities [ORG Joyandet  ] mentioned will shape any new PFAs concluded with partner countries . 
Other Structural Changes ------------------------ <a id='par32' href='#par32'>¶</a>32 . 
( C ) As noted ref A , the [ORG MFA  ] is planning to create a new " sous-direction " ( comparable to a [ORG State Department  ] regional office ) within its [ORG Africa Bureau  ] . 
There will then be four " sous-directions " in the [ORG Bureau  ] , which would create a structure resembling the four military commands covering [LOC Africa  ] and which would align the [ORG MFA  ] with [LOC Africa  ] 's sub-regional organizations ( [ORG ECOWAS  ] , [ORG SADC  ] , et al . 
) . 
We are told that a fourth sous-direction could lead to more desk officers -- at present , there are only 15 desk officers in the entire [ORG Bureau  ] , many of whom are first- or second-tour officers and at least two of whom ( the [LOC Chad  ] and [LOC Great Lakes  ] desks ) are seconded from other GOF agencies . 
( The present [LOC Chad  ] desk officer , like his predecessor , is an Army Lieutenant Colonel and the [LOC Great Lakes  ] desk officer is on loan from the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] . 
) <a id='par33' href='#par33'>¶</a>33 . 
( C ) [ORG MFA Africa Bureau  ] contacts say that other changes are under consideration , including making it easier for officials from other ministries to serve at the [ORG MFA  ] , and even an idea to make [LOC France  ] 's diplomatic corps less distinct and more like other branches of [LOC France  ] 's civil service . 
While this is perceived as a possible dilution of traditional " diplomacy , " some believe that making [ORG MFA  ] staff more fungible could reinvigorate the diplomatic corps , strip it of its perceived elitist nature , and allow it to profit from the experiences and backgrounds of non-diplomats. <a id='par34' href='#par34'>¶</a>34 . 
( C ) The [ORG Diplomatic White Paper  ] issued in July also suggests , without specificity , that [LOC France  ] could consider working with [ORG EU  ] partners to create shared or co-located diplomatic facilities abroad , which would permit cost savings among those involved . 
While joint ambassadorships would not be possible in the near term for legal reasons , the consular function , for example , could be exercised jointly by several partner countries. <a id='par35' href='#par35'>¶</a>35 . 
( C ) Finally , [PER Nathalie Delapalme  ] , a respected expert and [LOC PARIS  ] 00001698 008 OF 009 an [ORG MFA Africa Advisor  ] for several Foreign Ministers during the [ORG Chirac Presidency  ] , reportedly has suggested that [LOC France  ] could further rationalize its presence in [LOC Africa  ] by dividing its diplomatic missions into three classes , which would allow a better use of resources . 
FM [PER Kouchner  ] echoed some of these ideas during his speech at the [MISC French  ] Chiefs of [MISC Mission  ] conference in August 2008 . 
-- " Full service " missions: [LOC South Africa  ] , [LOC Cameroon  ] , [LOC Cote  ] d'Ivoire [LOC Ethiopia  ] , [LOC Kenya  ] , [LOC Madagascar  ] , [LOC Mali  ] , [LOC Nigeria  ] , [ORG DRC  ] , and [LOC Senegal  ] . 
The missions in [LOC South Africa  ] , [LOC Cameroon  ] , [LOC Kenya  ] , and [LOC Senegal  ] would also have regional economic responsibilities . 
-- " Priority " missions: [LOC Angola  ] , [LOC Benin  ] , [LOC Botswana  ] , [LOC Burkina Faso  ] , [LOC Burundi  ] , [LOC Comoros  ] , [LOC Congo  ] [LOC Brazzaville  ] , [LOC Djibouti  ] , [LOC Gabon  ] , [LOC Ghana  ] , [LOC Guinea  ] , [LOC Mauritius  ] , [LOC Niger  ] , [LOC C.A.R.  ] , [LOC Chad  ] , and [LOC Togo  ] . 
Some of these could offer some of the services provided by " full service " missions . 
-- " Limited " missions: [LOC Botswana  ] ( if not classed higher ) , [LOC Cape Verde  ] , [LOC Eritrea  ] , [LOC Guinea-Bissau  ] , [LOC Equatorial Guinea  ] , [LOC Liberia  ] , [LOC Namibia  ] , [LOC Seychelles  ] , [LOC Zambia  ] , and [LOC Zimbabwe  ] . 
These missions , each with only about a dozen staff , would be more " diplomatic presence posts " ( akin to the [MISC USG APP  ] concept ) working in a " simplified format . 
" For now , this kind of reorganization still appears in an embryonic stage , but changes of this sort could take place if the [PER Sarkozy  ] government implements its broader plans for restructuring . 
Conclusion ---------- <a id='par36' href='#par36'>¶</a>36 . 
( C ) In saying that he would " reform " [LOC France  ] 's [LOC Africa  ] policy , [PER Sarkozy  ] has taken on a task of formidable proportions , which is no less than to break once and for all from the colonial and post-colonial world and its mindset and to bring relations into today 's era . 
To do so , he must overcome inertia and a certain level of comfort on both sides that have accumulated over many years . 
Yet , as in other areas of [MISC French  ] policy , he seems determined to move forward and has taken his first steps . 
In our view , this is a positive development , for [MISC France-Afrique  ] was becoming an increasingly creaky , costly , and potentially dangerous vehicle for dealing with a continent rife with challenges , less amenable to heeding its former colonial masters , and inescapably engaged in global issues of all kinds , from terrorism , to the environment , to drug trafficking , to energy resource management , and well beyond. <a id='par37' href='#par37'>¶</a>37 . 
( C ) But , will [MISC France-Afrique  ] and old habits ever completely fade ? 
One MOD contact , not known for sentimentality , believes that certain parts of [MISC France-Afrique  ] will endure , if for no other reason than the common use of the [MISC French  ] language and long intertwined histories . 
Prefacing his remarks by noting their lack of " political correctness " and their triteness , he says that the relationship was for a long time similar to a parent-child relationship . 
" Now , the child is an adult , capable of and deserving of more autonomy , yet still welcoming our help and guidance . 
What [PER Sarkozy  ] is doing is kicking the fledgling out of the nest , which is sort of the way he approaches a lot of problems . 
A heavy dose of what you might call 'tough love , ' not always dispensed lovingly . 
Eventually , the now-grown adult child will be replaced by something resembling a cousin or a nephew . 
We will grow farther apart and less apt to look to each other reflexively , but some familial bond will remain , however much we may seek to deny it , and familial bonds are always to be nurtured . 
Our job is to make sure that this inevitable drifting apart takes place positively on both sides , does not completely extinguish the bond , and , most importantly , does not turn into an estrangement . 
That would be a loss for everyone -- [MISC French  ] , [MISC Africans  ] , and [MISC Americans  ] .
