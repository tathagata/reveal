( U ) This is an action request . 
Embassy [LOC Beijing  ] , please see paragraph 2. -------------- ACTION REQUEST -------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Post is requested to draw on the points in para 4 below and to provide photographs in a demarche to the Government of [LOC China  ] ( [ORG GOC  ] ) on the issue of transfers of advanced conventional weapons such as MANPADS to [LOC Iran  ] . 
NOTE THAT THE POINTS FLAGGED AS PROVIDED BY THE IC MUST BE USED VERBATIM. ---------- BACKGROUND ---------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In April 2008 , Coalition forces recovered from a cache in [LOC Basra  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] at least two Chinese-produced Iranian-supplied [MISC QW-1  ] MANPADS that we assess were provided by [LOC Iran  ] to [MISC Iraqi  ] [ORG Shia  ] militants . 
The date of production for the recovered [MISC QW-1  ] systems is 2003 , but it is not known when these particular launchers were transferred by [LOC China  ] to [LOC Iran  ] or when the launchers entered [LOC Iraq  ] . 
We have demarched [LOC China  ] repeatedly on its conventional arms transfers to [LOC Iran  ] , urging [LOC Beijing  ] to stop these transfers due to unacceptably high risk that such weapons would be diverted to militants and terrorists in [LOC Iraq  ] and elsewhere . 
[LOC Beijing  ] has typically responded by asserting that its sales are in accordance with international law , that it requires end-users to sign agreements pledging not to retransfer the weapons , or -- disingenuously in the judgment of [ORG USG  ] technical experts -- that it cannot confirm that the weapons recovered by Coalition forces in [LOC Iraq  ] are actually [MISC Chinese  ] in origin . 
This latest recovery of [MISC Chinese-origin  ] weapons in [LOC Iraq  ] gives us yet another opportunity to present the [MISC Chinese  ] government with concrete evidence that [LOC Iran  ] is illicitly diverting [MISC Chinese-origin  ] weapons and to urge [LOC Beijing  ] to take concrete steps to halt future diversions and investigate past transfers to [LOC Tehran.  ] -------------- TALKING POINTS -------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC S/REL  ] [LOC CHINA  ] ) BEGIN TALKING POINTS: TRANSFERS OF MANPADS TO [LOC IRAN  ] ----------------------------- -- We have repeatedly raised with you our concerns regarding [LOC Iran  ] , s retransfer of Chinese-produced weapons to extremists and terrorists in [LOC Iraq  ] and elsewhere . 
-- We understand that you have provided [LOC Iran  ] with [MISC QW-1  ] MANPADS in the past , and [LOC Iran  ] has publicly asserted that it produces the [MISC Misagh-1  ] , which is based on the [MISC Chinese  ] [MISC QW-1  ] . 
-- We previously raised with you the recovery in [LOC Iraq  ] in 2004 of an [MISC Iranian-origin Misagh-1 MANPAD  ] that had been fired at a civilian airliner . 
-- We have recently acquired additional information about [MISC Iranian  ] diversions of [MISC Chinese-origin  ] MANPADS that we would like to share with you . 
BEGIN IC POINTS THAT MUST BE USED VERBATIM: -- Coalition forces recovered at least two [MISC Chinese  ] [MISC QW-1  ] MANPADS missiles from a militant cache in [LOC Basra  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] in April 2008 . 
The missiles had 2003 production markings , had not been fired , and were still intact in their launch tubes . 
-- We assess that these missiles were provided to [MISC Iraqi  ] [ORG Shia  ] militants by [LOC Iran  ] . 
END IC POINTS THAT MUST BE USED VERBATIM . 
MANPADS TRANSFERS TO STATE SPONSORS OF TERRORISM --------------------------------------------- --- -- [LOC Iran  ] is the world’s most active state sponsor of terrorism . 
We know that [LOC Iran  ] has provided [MISC Chinese  ] weapons to extremist groups in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] that are using these weapons to kill [MISC Americans  ] and [MISC Iraqis  ] , something we take very seriously . 
-- [LOC Iran  ] is not a responsible purchaser of military equipment . 
There is an unacceptably high risk that any military equipment sold to [LOC Iran  ] , especially weapons like [MISC MANPADS  ] , that are highly sought-after by terrorists , will be diverted to non-state actors who threaten [LOC U.S.  ] and Coalition forces in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] as well as civilians across the region . 
-- It is for that reason UNSCR 1747 calls on states to exercise vigilance and restraint in the transfer of systems contained in the [ORG UN Register of Conventional Arms  ] , such as MANPADS . 
Likewise , the [ORG United Nations General Assembly  ] passed resolution A/62/391 encouraging state members to ban the transfer of [MISC MANPADS  ] to non-state actors . 
-- We strongly urge you to: terminate all weapons-related , including further [MISC MANPADS-related  ] transfers and technical assistance to [LOC Iran  ] , in accordance with UNSCR 1747 ; insist that [LOC Iran  ] cease any weapons-production related activities based on or including [MISC Chinese  ] technology , to include [MISC MANPADS  ] technology ; insist that [LOC Iran  ] stop illicit retransfers of [MISC Chinese-origin  ] weapons , or Iranian-produced weapons based on [MISC Chinese  ] designs , to non-state actors ; insist that [LOC Iran  ] provide an accounting of all [MISC Chinese-origin  ] weapons ; and institute thorough , regular inspections of [MISC Chinese-origin  ] weapons already in [MISC Iranian  ] stocks to determine how many may have been diverted and to prevent future diversions . 
-- We ask that you share with us the results of your investigations into this matter . 
SERIAL NUMBERS OF WEAPONS SOLD TO IRAQ: ------------------------------------------ -- We have provided you with information on specific [MISC Chinese  ] weapons systems that we have recovered in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
-- Further information you can provide to us on your sales of these systems to [LOC Iran  ] would help our investigators on the ground distinguish between weapons newly transferred to [ORG Shia  ] militants and those transferred prior to the commencement of armed conflict in 2003 . 
Serial numbers of equipment sold to [LOC Iran  ] would be most helpful in this regard . 
END TALKING POINTS .
