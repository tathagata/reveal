( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Summary:  ] The newly-formed corporation overseeing redevelopment of the former [ORG U.S. Naval Air Station Keflavik  ] ( [ORG NASKEF  ] ) site is inheriting an additional problem in the form of serious water damage from frozen pipes in a number of residential buildings . 
The Ministry for [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] , which took ownership of the [ORG NASKEF  ] site ( less some properties retained by [ORG NATO  ] ) September 30 but had not gotten around to letting a maintenance contract , has confirmed that the Government of [LOC Iceland  ] will bear the costs of repair , with early estimates ranging upwards from $150,000 . 
( In contrast only one [MISC NATO-owned  ] building suffered damage - and that minimal - as the [LOC U.S.  ] military had contracted with a local firm to maintain [ORG NATO  ] facilities . 
) <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary , cont 'd : The redevelopment corporation , which was to have taken over responsibility for the facilities this fall but in all likelihood will not do so until January 2007 , claims the incident will not pose an obstacle to plans for use of the property . 
Press coverage has been straightforward , with no implication of USG responsibility . 
We believe the corporation will attempt to make the best of the incident by using it to press for quicker action . 
End summary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Upon the closure of [ORG U.S. Naval Air Station Keflavik  ] ( [ORG NASKEF  ] ) on September 30 , the Government of [LOC Iceland  ] took ownership of roughly 500 structures , including 2000 housing units in multi-unit buildings . 
Media on the evening of November 20 reported the discovery of serious water damage in a number of the buildings , stemming from frozen cold-water pipes during a recent cold snap . 
The water leakage resulted in damage ranging from minor wall damage to collapsed ceilings and warped floors in approximately 90 individual apartment units , according to the director of the corporation overseeing redevelopment of the [ORG NASKEF  ] site. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) A member of [ORG Post  ] 's interim military detachment ( on loan from EUCOM to wrap up transition issues ) visited the base and confirmed that only one of the 67 [MISC NATO-owned  ] buildings on the site was affected . 
In that case , a burst pipe in a maintenance shed resulted in minimal damage . 
( Note: the USG has responsibility for maintenance of the [MISC NATO-owned  ] buildings through September 2007 ; local contractor ICG has monitored the buildings for any problems and is adjusting its procedures to ensure that similar water-leakage problems do not develop . 
End note . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ministry for [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] ( [ORG MFA  ] ) was quick to note to the media that the [MISC Icelandic  ] Government would have to bear the costs for any repairs . 
[ORG MFA  ] officials also noted that work is continuing on wrapping up the necessary legal maneuvers to transfer ownership to the redevelopment corporation . 
Corporation director [PER Kjartan Eriksson  ] put a brave face on the damage , noting to [ORG Post  ] that in any event there were plans for renovations in the apartment buildings and that the incident would simply accelerate those plans . 
[PER Eriksson  ] estimated that the cost of repairs could be in the tens of millions of [MISC Icelandic  ] kronur ( 10 million ISK = $150,000 ) but demurred from elaborating further until a final assessment is done. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Comment:  ] the damage poses the first headache for the base redevelopment corporation ( septel ) , which has watched in frustration as it has not legally taken ownership of the buildings and thus had not been able to arrange maintenance contracts for them . 
We believe the corporation will attempt to make the best of the incident by using it to press for quicker action in seizing the development opportunities presented at the former [ORG NASKEF  ] site .
