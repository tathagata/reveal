( S ) SUMMARY: In the context of the close and sustained cooperation between the [ORG USG  ] and [ORG GOE  ] on counterterrorism , [PER Post  ] believes that the written [ORG GOE  ] assurances regarding the return of three [MISC Egyptians  ] detained at [LOC Guantanamo  ] ( reftel ) represent the firm commitment of the [ORG GOE  ] to adhere to the requested principles . 
These assurances were passed directly from [MISC Egyptian  ] General Intelligence Service ( [ORG EGIS  ] ) Chief [PER Soliman  ] through liaison channels -- the most effective communication path on this issue . 
General [PER Soliman  ] 's word is the [ORG GOE  ] 's guarantee , and the [ORG GOE  ] 's track record of cooperation on [LOC CT  ] issues lends further support to this assessment . 
End summary . 
[MISC EGYPTIAN  ] ASSURANCES ------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) As stated in reftel , [PER Post  ] has received written assurances from the [MISC Egyptian  ] General Intelligence Service ( [ORG EGIS  ] ) regarding the acceptance and humane treatment of three [MISC Egyptians  ] currently detained in [LOC Guantanamo:  ] -- [PER Abdul Rahman Mohammed AL-MARZOUQ  ] , ISN US9EG-00369DP ; -- [PER Allah Muhammad SALEEM  ] , ISN US9EG-00071DP ; -- [PER Sami Abdul Aziz Salim ALLAITHY  ] , ISN US9EG-000287DP . 
[PER Post  ] believes that these assurances represent a firm commitment by the [ORG GOE  ] to handle the matter in accordance with our stated principles . 
We recommend that the interagency consider approving transfer now on the basis of these assurances . 
DIRECT CHANNEL -------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) [PER Post  ] has established that the most effective conduit for addressing this issue is through [ORG Cairo Station  ] - [ORG EGIS  ] Liaison . 
The written assurances ( reftel ) were passed directly from [ORG EGIS  ] Chief General [PER Soliman  ] through this channel . 
General [PER Soliman  ] 's stature and power in the [MISC Egyptian  ] establishment , and his history of close cooperation with the [ORG USG  ] on counterterrorism , corroborate the [MISC Egyptian  ] intent take responsibility for the detainees in such a way that protects both [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Egyptian  ] security interests . 
In addition to the written assurances regarding the detainees treatment , [ORG EGIS  ] has conveyed orally to [LOC Cairo  ] station that all three will be taken into custody upon arrival in [LOC Egypt  ] and will be investigated and prosecuted in accordance with [MISC Egyptian  ] law. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) We understand the need for specific language on this matter . 
However , the danger of seeking specificity beyond what we have already received in [LOC EGIS'  ] written assurances is that [ORG EGIS  ] may decide to turn the case over to the [ORG MFA  ] . 
[ORG MFA  ] involvement will complicate the process and delay disposal of the cases .
