Minister [PER Bildt  ] expressed his fears over [MISC Afghan  ] perceptions of the upcoming conference of Special Representatives for [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] ( [PER SRAP  ] ) to be held in [LOC Paris  ] September 2 . 
We corrected his misperceptions over a reported rift between [PER SRAP Holbrooke  ] and President [PER Karzai  ] . 
End Summary. ------------------------------ Looking at the Next Five Years ------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Looking ahead to the resolution of the presidential election , Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] laid out five key steps which we recommend that the international community should observe , as we have , when engaging with both [ORG Abdullah  ] and [PER Karzai  ] , but particularly the incumbent: -- first , both leading candidates should understand we are paying close attention to their conduct in this interim period before the certification of the vote , and that their conduct will impact their relationship with the international community thereafter , whether as President or in another capacity. -- secondly , the next President shoudl understand that we will scrutinize closely his ministerial appointments for competence and commitment to good governance. -- third , the next President’s first major policy speeches , including his inauguration speech , will set the tone for his second administration and offer an opportunity to establish a compact with his people . 
Minister [PER Bildt  ] noted that [PER Karzai  ] might use such a speech to confront the international community. -- fourth , as the President begins his new administration , he must take significant , visible acts to deliver his compact , for example by acting boldly against corruption. -- fifth and finally , if the next President accomplishes the first four steps well , we should accept an invitation from him to a ministerial conference in [LOC Kabul  ] , to solidify the relationship between the international community and the new administration and to bolster its legitimacy domestically and internationally. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Minister [PER Bildt  ] assented to all five points , and noted that the conference of foreign ministers could be a key moment in which to emphasize more [MISC Afghan  ] ownership of the political landscape following the election. --------------------------------------------- - Setting the Stakes for a Second Administration --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Expressing concern that President [PER Karzai  ] still seems to think that we are here on an expeditionary mission to kill foreign fighters operating in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and that he is just renting land to us for that purpose , Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] proposed that the second administration could be an opportunity to clarify anew the relationship between the international community and the [PER Karzai  ] administration . 
First , we must disabuse President [PER Karzai  ] of the notion that we are just another imperialist force or that we are really here because of [LOC China  ] and because we want bases here for strategic regional purposes . 
Heretofore , President [PER Karzai  ] has expressed negligible political interest in the development of the [ORG Afghan National Army  ] ( [ORG ANA  ] ) and [ORG Afghan National Police  ] ( [ORG ANP  ] ) , key components of a successful sovereign nation . 
We need to give him long-term security guarantees so that he will understand the importance of investing in these institutions , [PER Eikenberry  ] said , while assuring him that we will continue to support Afghanistan’s security infrastructure as an element of their sovereign nation. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) A key agenda item for a second [PER Karzai  ] administration could be the reconciliation process . 
Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] questioned [PER Bildt  ] whether this would pose a public relations problem with the domestic audiences of the [ORG European Union  ] . 
The reconciliation effort , he noted , could be a key opportunity for the [PER Karzai  ] administration to show progress in the development of [MISC Afghan  ] governance . 
Until now , the reconciliation process has been marred by a lack of infrastructure and resources , both of which the international community could help to provide . 
[PER Bildt  ] assured us that reconciliation would not be a problem in [LOC Europe  ] unless it was perceived as rolling back women’s rights , educational development , and other key human rights issues . 
He noted [LOC KABUL  ] 00002658 002 OF 002 there were constitutional constraints in [LOC Europe  ] to supporting programs representing an erosion of human rights in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , but affirmed that he did not see any evidence that could support an argument along those lines . 
The delegation called for the [MISC Afghans  ] to establish a precise concept for integration before the process can begin. ------------------------------------------- Maintaining the Legitimacy of the Elections ------------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Minister [PER Bildt  ] expressed concerns that the legitimacy of the election was being called into question . 
He noted that while the conference in [LOC Paris  ] of special representatives was “perfectly normal and routine , ” it had been “blown up” by the press , who were insinuating that the special representatives would emerge from closed doors at the conference and declare the winner of the election . 
Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] said that the same message had been relayed to him by a group of pro-Karzai parliamentarians who had called at the Embassy on August 30 ( reftel ) . 
Likewise , [PER Eikenberry  ] noted that [PER Karzai  ] has begun to express great frustration with the international media , whom he claims are pitted against him and are trying to undermine the credibility of the elections by exaggerating claims of fraud . 
[PER Eikenberry  ] also noted that [PER Karzai  ] and his supports may attack the findings of the [ORG Electoral Complaints Commission  ] ( [ORG ECC  ] ) as biased , because it has foreigners in key leadership positions. ----------------------------------- Smoothing Relations with the Palace ----------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Responding to Minister Bildt’s statement that both President [PER Karzai  ] and Foreign Minister [PER Spanta  ] had “stern words” that were “not directed at me , ” on the subject of post-election posturing , [PER Eikenberry  ] explained the miscommunication that had occurred between [PER Karzai  ] and [PER SRAP Holbrooke  ] regarding the possibility of a second round of elections: [PER Holbrooke  ] had stated in a phone call with other Special Representatives that , if there were to be a second round , the international community would need to coordinate to support the effort . 
This was misreported to the [MISC Afghan  ] government as USG advocacy for holding a second round , no matter the final results of the [MISC IEC’s  ] election process . 
[PER Eikenberry  ] reassured [PER Bildt  ] that he had worked closely with FM [PER Spanta  ] and President [PER Karzai  ] to dispel this myth ; the story seemed to have blown over , and relations between the [LOC U.S.  ] and President [PER Karzai  ] were and back on track .
