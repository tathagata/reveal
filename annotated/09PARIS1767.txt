( C/NF ) SUMMARY AND COMMENT: Our current relationship with [LOC France  ] is so profoundly healthy that conventional wisdom now asserts that there are no significant differences in the foreign policies of our two countries . 
While it is true that the relationship is at a historical peak , it is not the case that our objectives and approaches are identical on all major issues . 
Upcoming events in 2010 will bring to the forefront some foreign-policy divergences in our relationship with [LOC France  ] -- primarily in our approaches to multilateral issues like arms control , [MISC European  ] security , and the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
These differences will present challenges , and they risk causing last-minute ripples in our bilateral relationship if not addressed early in our planning . 
Some issues are being driven by outside deadlines , such as the upcoming May 2010 NPT RevCon , the global nuclear security summit , and the [ORG Lisbon NATO  ] summit next fall . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] , which is addressed in other reporting , may also fall into this category , since a [MISC French  ] decision on further contributions will be contingent in part on the outcome of the January conference in [LOC London  ] . 
Other divergences come from tactical differences towards shared objectives ( in particular the [MISC French  ] President 's predilection for proposing high-level summits on everything from [LOC Middle East  ] peace to [MISC European  ] security ) . 
The most difficult to manage will be those issues that [LOC Paris  ] believes could potentially impact core [MISC French  ] values , such as their policy of nuclear deterrence . 
In such cases , the [MISC French  ] will show the least flexibility . 
END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. --------------------------------------------- - NONPROLIFERATION AND DISARMAMENT --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) BACKGROUND: The [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC France  ] are in substantial agreement on our goals for the May 2010 Non-Proliferation [ORG Treaty Review Conference  ] ( NPT RevCon ) . 
However , these issues will also present some of our biggest challenges . 
[LOC France  ] can act -- and has -- as a " force multiplier " for the [LOC United States  ] with more passive [MISC European  ] partners on non-proliferation issues from [LOC Iran  ] to supporting [ORG UN  ] counter-proliferation capacity-building efforts . 
However , the approach of the NPT RevCon poses a concrete deadline for the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC France  ] to address our ongoing differences on nuclear disarmament . 
[LOC France  ] argues that a [LOC U.S.  ] focus on disarmament at the [ORG RevCon  ] would open the door for non-aligned nations to make the conference a referendum on actual disarmament progress by the P3 . 
These nations would thus make signing on to further concrete non-proliferation commitments contingent upon further disarmament by the [LOC United States  ] , or more worrying from [MISC Paris'  ] perspective , comparable disarmament or transparency efforts by [LOC France  ] . 
As [LOC France  ] has already made significant disarmament efforts and has a markedly smaller nuclear arsenal than the [LOC United States  ] , [MISC French  ] officials tell us additional cuts would negatively impact [LOC France  ] 's nuclear deterrent capabilities . 
Therefore , [LOC France  ] wants to focus as much as possible on non-proliferation at the NPT [MISC RevCon  ] and , ideally , avoid any significant discussion of disarmament. -POTENTIAL FOR [ORG FRENCH FLEXIBILITY:  ] Low on policy , but medium on tactics . 
The [ORG GOF  ] position on disarmament reflects [LOC France  ] 's national obsession with its nuclear deterrent . 
[MISC French  ] officials do not hesitate to describe their commitment to maintaining their independent deterrent as " psychological . 
" This applies not only to the capability itself , but to the concept of a deterrent . 
The [MISC French  ] frequently express their concern that [LOC U.S.  ] calls for a " world free of nuclear weapons " serve to delegitimize nuclear weapons as an element of strategy . 
However , the [MISC French  ] understand the [LOC United States  ] is also committed to maintaining a nuclear deterrent force for as long as necessary . 
While the [MISC French  ] can probably adjust to our differences on ultimate disarmament objectives , they are more worried by the arguments we might make to achieve our shared non-proliferation goals at the [ORG RevCon  ] . 
[MISC French  ] officials have explicitly threatened to " stonewall " or " put ( the [LOC United States  ] ) on the spot " if they feel their disarmament red-lines are jeopardized by [LOC U.S.  ] statements. -WAY FORWARD: To maximize cooperation and minimize the risk of [MISC French  ] obstructionism in P5 negotiations or at the [ORG RevCon  ] itself , it may be worth again making clear our " rhetorical red-lines " as well as our policy red-lines . 
If it is vital to our [ORG RevCon  ] strategy to highlight our objective of a " world free of nuclear weapons , " to stress the link between P5 [LOC PARIS  ] 00001767 002 OF 004 disarmament and stricter non-proliferation measures under the NPT , or to call on other nuclear weapons states to make further disarmament efforts , we should make this very clear in advance to the [MISC French  ] . 
The [MISC French  ] will not like it , but advance notice may at least prevent a last minute overreaction that could threaten P3 unity on our shared goals for the [LOC RevCon.  ] -DEADLINE: Soon . 
The [ORG RevCon  ] is scheduled for May 2010 . 
Reaching a modus vivendi with [LOC France  ] on disarmament tactics at the [ORG RevCon  ] is critical to ensure the success of ongoing P5 consultations and outreach to [ORG Non-Aligned Movement  ] nations. --------------------------------------------- - [LOC MIDDLE EAST  ] PEACE --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) BACKGROUND: [LOC France  ] , including President [PER Sarkozy  ] himself , wants to be a serious player in [LOC Middle East  ] peace , and [MISC French  ] officials are continually frustrated by a perceived lack of progress on an issue that impacts [MISC French  ] national interests and world standing . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] 's keen interest is also evident in his re-balancing of [LOC France  ] 's role by building close ties to [LOC Israel  ] and in his attempts to marginalize entrenched [LOC Middle East  ] experts ( in the [ORG MFA  ] and elsewhere ) who do not respond to his calls for new , active policy directions . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] is prepared to support [LOC U.S.  ] efforts , but he has latched onto the idea of a [LOC Middle East  ] summit as a way of jump-starting the process . 
To add legitimacy to his initiative , he tried to partner with [LOC Egypt  ] , as co-president of the Union for the [MISC Mediterranean  ] ( [ORG UfM  ] ) , but he is not wedded to any particular format . 
For example , [MISC French  ] [ORG MFA  ] contacts are starting to float ideas of a smaller summit , headed by the quartet or other grouping , to achieve the same result , and [LOC France  ] has reportedly squared this initiative with [MISC Russian  ] desires , sanctioned by the [ORG UN Security Council  ] , to host a conference. -POTENTIAL FOR [ORG FRENCH FLEXIBILITY: High  ] , but at a cost . 
Since [LOC U.S.  ] participation in any summit would be a basic requirement , [LOC France  ] has little room for maneuver without the [ORG USG  ] 's blessing . 
However , given [PER Sarkozy  ] 's personal interest , continued [LOC U.S.  ] reluctance may become a growing irritant to the [MISC GOF.  ] -WAY FORWARD: Our current strategy for responding to [MISC French  ] inquiries is to note the conditions-based requirement for a successful dialogue . 
If the [ORG USG  ] does not believe the timing is currently right for a summit meeting , we may find it helpful to provide a more definitive frame of reference to our [MISC French  ] interlocutors as to the potential timeline or specific conditions-based requirements for a summit . 
As long as [PER Sarkozy  ] remains hopeful that a summit could be possible , anything less specific is unlikely to dampen his enthusiasm or efforts and contribute to raised expectations that could harm our effort. -DEADLINE: Ongoing . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] will continue to seek opportunities to present his ideas to us and to others , particularly in the context of other international summit-level meetings. --------------------------------------------- -- [ORG EUROPEAN SECURITY  ] --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) BACKGROUND: [LOC France  ] has been pushing for a high-level discussion on [MISC European  ] security ever since President [PER Sarkozy  ] surprised allies in October 2008 by publicly proposing a summit to address the [PER Medvedev  ] proposal for a new treaty covering [MISC European  ] security architecture . 
The [MISC French  ] goal is two-fold: to engage [LOC Russia  ] and to break the logjam on intractable issues like the Conventional Forces in [LOC Europe  ] ( [ORG CFE  ] ) treaty . 
While we succeeded this June in anchoring this discussion in the [ORG OSCE  ] [LOC Corfu Process  ] , divisive [MISC Russian  ] tactics and high-level [MISC French  ] impatience are likely to keep this issue simmering in the foreseeable future . 
The impetus in [LOC Paris  ] comes from the highest level ; it is President [PER Sarkozy  ] himself who believes that any non-response by the allies to [MISC Russian  ] proposals leaves the ball in our court . 
[MISC French  ] officials admit they were " surprised " by the draft text that [LOC Russia  ] is now circulating , but continue to stress that a response by allies is required . 
Further , [PER Sarkozy  ] is reportedly very impatient with the slow [LOC Corfu  ] process and is already tasking his staff to come up with alternate proposals to make progress -- including following [LOC PARIS  ] 00001767 003 OF 004 up on his original idea for an [ORG OSCE  ] summit in 2010 . 
[ORG GOF  ] officials fear that without a concrete deadline/goal , the [LOC Corfu  ] process will simply lose momentum and we will have a " lost year " in 2010 . 
All indications are that there is nothing [PER Sarkozy  ] abhors more than what he perceives to be a vacuum . 
On [ORG CFE  ] , [MISC French  ] officials are becoming increasingly vocal that we need to re-engage on next steps once START negotiations are complete and have evidenced a willingness to de-link [ORG CFE  ] from [LOC Russia  ] 's fulfillment of its [LOC Istanbul  ] commitments . 
Further , [ORG MFA Strategic Affairs  ] Director [PER Patrick Maisonnave  ] recently said that [LOC Paris  ] supports including the human dimension in our broader security discussions , but that it should not be used to halt progress entirely . 
" Human rights is not at the heart of the question of security , " [PER Maisonnave  ] stated . 
Post understands from Presidency contacts that [LOC Paris  ] is preparing a non-paper to argue once again that the deadline of a summit will add the necessary stimulus for progress on issues from [ORG CFE  ] to [ORG Nagorno-Karabakh.  ] -POTENTIAL [ORG FRENCH FLEXIBILITY: Medium  ] . 
Strong [ORG USG  ] and allied opposition to [MISC French  ] support for a summit may not make the idea go away , but could encourage the [MISC French  ] to morph their plans for engagement into something more acceptable. -WAY FORWARD: To maximize the chances for constructive cooperation , post recommends beginning a regular dialogue with the [MISC French  ] on these over-arching issues of [MISC European  ] security , using the " 2 plus 2 " political-military discussions currently scheduled for January 20 in [LOC Washington  ] as a good step . 
[MISC German  ] influence and actions can also play a big role in channeling [MISC French  ] activity , so additional follow-up in a [LOC Quad  ] format may be worth considering . 
Finally , we may want to think about taking a page from the [MISC French  ] handbook and suggest an alternative proposal that may include a deadline for progress -- this could be a lower-level conference , formation of a working group , or other event . 
This could give [LOC Paris  ] the target it claims is currently lacking , channel some of the [MISC French  ] energy and allow us to selectively move forward on the issues that we deem sufficiently ripe , without forcing a broader preliminary discussion at the highest level. -DEADLINE: Ongoing . 
We can expect this to be a continuing discussion in 2010 given the enduring interest by the [MISC French  ] President , even if few allies are on board. --------------------------------------------- -- [ORG MISSILE DEFENSE  ] --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) BACKGROUND: Thus far , [LOC France  ] has taken pains to be supportive of [LOC U.S.  ] missile defense efforts in [LOC Europe  ] , including agreeing to positive language for the declaration at the 2009 [ORG NATO  ] summit in [LOC Strasbourg  ] and in the communique issued at the December [ORG NATO  ] ministerial meeting . 
However , [MISC French  ] officials have warned us that the " devil is in the details , " and we will be hard-pressed to get agreement at the 2010 [ORG NATO  ] summit in [LOC Lisbon  ] in the absence of a clearer idea of what the [LOC U.S.  ] is proposing , and more specifically , what we expect [ORG NATO  ] common funding to pay . 
[PER Maisonnave  ] has noted to us that it is still unclear how our " [MISC Phased Adaptive Approach  ] " ( [ORG PAA  ] ) will interact with [ORG NATO  ] 's Active [ORG Layered Theatre Ballistic Missile Defense  ] ( [ORG ALTBMD  ] ) and what modifications and concomitant costs may be required . 
Even more fundamental to [MISC French  ] interests is the impact of missile defense on [LOC France  ] 's nuclear deterrent capability . 
The impact of [LOC MD  ] on the [MISC French  ] deterrent could be simple cause and effect -- if other countries develop more strategic missiles due to [ORG NATO  ] implementation of a [LOC MD  ] system it could call into question [MISC French  ] deterrent capabilities . 
However , potential [LOC MD  ] disagreements can also run deeper , such as when [LOC France  ] recently balked at calling missile defense a " mission of [ORG NATO  ] " in the December ministerial communique , which to [MISC French  ] ears called into question the core purpose of [ORG NATO  ] and had potential implications on [MISC French  ] deterrence policy . 
[MISC French  ] officials concede that [LOC MD  ] could complement their deterrent , but emphasize that it can never become a substitute for this core element of [MISC French  ] defense. -POTENTIAL [ORG FRENCH FLEXIBILITY: High  ] . 
[ORG GOF  ] officials are blunt in stating that [MISC French  ] reluctance is tied to financing rather than political will , and in an era of financial constraints and growing public deficits , the financial question is not a negligible one . 
However , [LOC France  ] is fully prepared to work with us on missile defense as long as we are cognizant of their nuclear deterrence red-lines and consult [LOC PARIS  ] 00001767 004 OF 004 fully on costs and technical parameters of our proposed system. -WAY FORWARD: The sooner we are able to share more concrete information with the [MISC French  ] and our other [ORG NATO  ] partners , the more time we will have to make our case for why territorial missile defense is essential to [ORG NATO  ] and how we can make [ORG PAA  ] work with [ORG ALTBMD  ] to implement it . 
The [MISC French  ] hope that early in the new year we will be able to provide more technical information about what the [LOC United States  ] envisions so that discussions can begin in earnest about what Allies will be expected to pay for or to contribute. -DEADLINE: The first half of 2010 . 
The more we can do to provide early and concrete information , the less likely we are to have any disagreements in the run up to the [LOC Lisbon  ] [ORG NATO  ] summit in November 2010 .
