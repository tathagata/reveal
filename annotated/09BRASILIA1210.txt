( C ) Summary: [LOC Brazil  ] , which had pinned much of its hope for a quick resolution of the [LOC Honduras  ] crisis on the success of an [ORG OAS  ] or [LOC Costa Rica  ] President [PER Arias  ] , mission to [LOC Tegucigalpa  ] , now seems at a loss of how to protect its [MISC Embassy  ] in [LOC Tegucigalpa  ] and negotiate itself out of the standstill in [LOC Honduras  ] , domestic crisis . 
[LOC Brazil  ] has vowed to ignore [PER Micheletti  ] , s ten-day ultimatum for the release of [LOC Zelaya  ] , yet fears the repercussions its embassy will face , and is looking to the [ORG UN Security Council  ] for help . 
End summary. -------------------------------------- [LOC BRAZIL  ] SITTING ON ITS HANDS AND WAITING -------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [LOC Brazil  ] , s [ORG Ministry of External Relations  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) Head of [LOC Mexico  ] and [ORG Central America Division  ] First Secretary [PER Renato de Avila Viana  ] in September 28 and 30 meetings said that [LOC Brazil  ] was ignoring the ten-day ultimatum the [PER Micheletti  ] government gave the [MISC Brazilians  ] for turning over [LOC Zelaya  ] , however , greatly fears the repercussions its [MISC Embassy  ] in [LOC Tegucigalpa  ] will face once the ten days have passed . 
[PER Viana  ] thinks that the [PER Micheletti  ] government is looking to buy as much time as possible , which is why they barred the [ORG OAS  ] delegation from entering the country , but time is what [LOC Brazil  ] does not have in this situation while its [MISC Embassy  ] houses [LOC Zelaya  ] and is under constant threat by the [MISC Honduran  ] security forces . 
According to [PER Viana  ] , the [MISC Brazilian  ] [MISC Embassy  ] in [LOC Washington  ] received a bomb threat via telephone call against the [MISC Brazilian  ] Embassy in [LOC Tegucigalpa  ] ; [PER Viana  ] said the [LOC United States Secret Service  ] is working with the [MISC Brazilian  ] [MISC Embassy  ] in [LOC Washington  ] to trace the call. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Viana  ] said he was no longer confident that the [ORG OAS  ] will be able to enter [LOC Honduras  ] and begin a negotiation between the [PER Micheletti  ] and [LOC Zelaya  ] factions in the near future , and it is evident that President [PER Arias  ] is trying to untangle himself from the [MISC Honduran  ] situation as well . 
According to [PER Viana  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] does not yet have a new strategy to deal with the [MISC Honduran  ] crisis taking place in their embassy and is now looking to the [ORG Security Council  ] to take a strong stance on the situation to lead to greater international assistance . 
[PER Viana  ] said that the [ORG MRE  ] is only focused on engaging the [ORG USG  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] government on the issue of [LOC Honduras  ] . 
His office at the [ORG MRE  ] has been turned into the [LOC Honduras  ] situation room , running from nine in the morning until eleven at night , every day , but they were only processing information on the situation and not planning for the resolution of the crisis. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [MISC Brazilian  ] Senators [PER Eduardo Azeredo  ] ( [ORG PMDB-Minas Gerais  ] ) and [PER Heraclito Fortes  ] ( [ORG DEM-Piaui  ] ) , chairman and member of the [ORG Senate External Relations and National Defense Committee  ] respectively , told [MISC PolOffs  ] on September 30 that [LOC Brazil  ] is not able to deal with the situation in [LOC Honduras  ] and needs [ORG USG  ] assistance . 
[PER Fortes  ] said " We are not ready for this . 
Not in [LOC Honduras  ] . 
We don , t even have an Ambassador . 
It is just one officer and his driver . 
" [PER Azeredo  ] stressed that the [LOC United States  ] " should not separate itself " from its recent tradition of taking a strong role in promoting democracy in the region . 
He believes that the [ORG USG  ] is trying to take a more non-interventionist role , but said that this is not the time to stay on the sidelines. -------------------------------------- [LOC COSTA RICA  ] SHYING AWAY FROM INVOLVEMENT IN [LOC HONDURAS  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In a September 28 meeting with [PER Poloffs  ] , [LOC Costa Rica  ] Ambassador to [LOC Brazil  ] Jorge [PER Alfredo Robles Arias  ] said that , while [MISC Costa Rican  ] President [PER Arias  ] has the will to help mediate the situation , he will not make any effort to that end until he sees both the [PER Micheletti  ] and [LOC Zelaya  ] camps willing to come to the negotiating table . 
[PER Robles  ] explained that [PER Arias  ] will not risk his international prestige unless both sides are willing to move forward . 
[PER Robles  ] said that the [MISC Brazilian  ] government had yet to contact his embassy for information on [PER Arias  ] , potential role in the crisis and that [LOC Costa Rica  ] had no contact with the [PER Micheletti  ] government. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Robles  ] emphasized that [LOC Zelaya  ] , s return to power was an unconditional demand made by [LOC Costa Rica  ] and the rest of the region . 
[PER Robles  ] explained that it was after Secretary [PER Clinton  ] suggested that [PER Arias  ] become involved in the resolution of the crisis in [LOC Honduras  ] that he offered up the [LOC San Jose  ] accord . 
According to [PER Robles  ] , all items in the accord are ultimately negotiable , with the exception of [LOC Zelaya  ] , s return to the presidency . 
[PER Robles  ] repeatedly pressed for the [LOC U.S.  ] position on [LOC Zelaya  ] , s return to power , questioning if the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Congress  ] , lack of support for [LOC Zelaya  ] could lead to decreased pressure from the [LOC United States  ] on [LOC Honduras  ] and the international community to act . 
PolCouns told [PER Robles  ] that the [LOC United States  ] had notchanged our position with regard to the need for a peaceful resolution under the frameworks already laid out. -------------------------------------- POORLY PLANNED [ORG OAS  ] MISSION DERAILED -------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Robles  ] and [PER Viana  ] both confirmed that four out of the five [ORG OAS  ] representatives sent to [LOC Honduras  ] were barred from entering the country on September 27 . 
[PER Robles  ] claimed this was because of a lack of strategy by the [ORG OAS  ] , which sent a small group of representative who lacked status and diplomatic credentials without giving [LOC Honduras  ] previous warning of their arrival . 
Only the [MISC Chilean  ] representative of the five sent was allowed to enter [LOC Honduras  ] , most likely because of his experience in the region , according to [PER Robles  ] . 
[PER Viana  ] said that there are actually two [ORG OAS  ] representative in [LOC Honduras  ] right now , the [MISC Chilean  ] and the second highest ranking [MISC Brazilian  ] representative to the [ORG OAS  ] . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] representative , [PER Viana  ] explained , was going as part of the derailed mission but flew into [LOC Tegucigalpa  ] before the five other members of the [ORG OAS  ] delegation who encountered problems . 
[PER Viana  ] also noted that the [MISC Brazilian  ] , s entry into [LOC Tegucigalpa  ] was aided by the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Embassy  ] in [LOC Tegucigalpa.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Viana  ] claimed that the [MISC Spanish  ] government was also struggling to reestablish their presence in [LOC Honduras  ] . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] Ambassador and two other diplomats have been barred from entering the country until [LOC Spain  ] recognizes the [PER Micheletti  ] government , a situation [PER Viana  ] said the [MISC Spanish  ] are very troubled by . 
According to [PER Viana  ] , the [ORG Carter Center  ] , s Friends of [LOC Democratic Charter  ] are also planning to send a delegation to [LOC Honduras  ] next week , however , he believes they will also struggle to enter the country. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Comment: It is notable that [PER Viana  ] , [PER Robles  ] , and [PER Azeredo  ] all expressed concern that the [LOC United States  ] might waiver in its current stance , and that the [ORG OAS  ] and regional mediators alone cannot make inroads with the [PER Micheletti  ] and [LOC Zelaya  ] factions . 
Having been vocal in its support for [LOC Zelaya  ] , s return and dragged--almost certainly without advance warning--into an unaccustomed place at the center of the crisis , [LOC Brazil  ] appears to be at a loss as to what to do next . 
It is remarkable that the GOB has apparently made no effort to reach out within the region or taken a more assertive role in seeking a resolution . 
Instead , planted firmly in the back seat , it appears [LOC Brazil  ] is looking to the [LOC United States  ] , the [ORG OAS  ] , and the [ORG United Nations  ] to safeguard its interests and , it hopes , navigate toward a long-term solution .
