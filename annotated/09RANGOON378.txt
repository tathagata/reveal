Embassy Recommendation ---------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG Zaw Zaw  ] is one of several mid-level cronies actively attempting to curry favor with the regime and to use his government ties to expand his commercial enterprises . 
He , his family , and many of his companies are already listed on OFAC’s targeted sanctions list . 
Embassy [LOC Rangoon  ] recommends [ORG OFAC  ] also designate the above-mentioned companies and senior management under the [ORG JADE Act  ] . 
DINGER [PER RANGOON  ] 00000378 003.2 OF 004 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Burmese  ] government usually releases a supplementary budget later in the fiscal year reflecting higher expenditures ; its total annual deficits are thus greater than in the initial official budgets . 
For example , the [LOC FY08-09  ] supplementary appropriation added an additional 743.9 billion kyat ( approximately [MISC USD  ] 743 billion at current rates ) to that year’s budget , raising expenditures by more than 15 percent over projected totals. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As in previous years , “Government” received the largest allocation of additional funding ( [MISC USD  ] 282 million ) , approximately half of FY08-09’s supplemental appropriation . 
Businessmen explained that money likely funded ongoing construction costs in [LOC Nay Pyi  ] Taw , as well as other government infrastructure projects . 
SOEs received the second largest amount - 185 billion kyat ( [MISC USD  ] 185 million ) , a 65 percent budget increase . 
The [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] received an additional 9 billion kyat ( [MISC USD  ] 9 million ) and the [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] received 53 billion kyat ( [LOC US  ] 53 million ) . 
In response to [LOC Cyclone Nargis  ] , the [ORG GOB  ] allocated an additional 77 billion kyat ( [MISC USD  ] 77 million ) to the [ORG Ministry of Agriculture  ] while the [ORG Ministry of Social Welfare  ] received 44 billion kyat ( [MISC USD  ] 44 million ) . 
Weak Revenue Generation ----------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) During last year’s [ORG IMF Article IV consultations  ] , [ORG IMF  ] representatives highlighted the need for the [MISC Burmese  ] Government to improve its tax administration and modify its widespread discretionary tax exemptions . 
According to [ORG IMF  ] officials , the [ORG GOB  ] replied that one of its goals is to reduce the budget deficit by addressing the main causes: weak revenue collection , losses from inefficient SOEs and SEEs , unrestrained government spending , and budget expenditures for non-productive uses , such as defense and construction . 
However , business contacts reported that the [ORG GOB  ] did little to modify its tax structure in 2008 , leading them to question the government’s prediction of a 27 percent increase in tax revenues in [LOC FY09-10.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Over the past few years , authorities have attempted to increase revenues through stricter enforcement of income taxation and through an informal 2007 Customs valuation rate hike from 450 kyat/$1 to between 800 and 1200 kyat/$1 , depending on the product and its origin . 
While [ORG GOB  ] officials privately argue that this rate hike indicates an effort to reconcile the various exchange rates , it instead complicates Burma’s already complex informal exchange rate system. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) According to the [MISC FY09-10  ] budget data , most SOEs will operate at a loss . 
Even with extractive industries presumably posting sizable profits , the net SOE loss is predicted to be roughly 484 billion kyat ( [MISC USD  ] 484 million ) -- though this estimate could be too low . 
[ORG State-Owned Enterprises  ] registered a loss of 601 million kyat in [LOC FY08-09  ] , substantially more than [ORG GOB  ] initial estimates of 450 billion kyat . 
According to budget publications , SOEs lost 800 billion kyat in [LOC FY07-08  ] , 436 billion kyat in [LOC FY06-07  ] , and 549 billion kyat in [LOC FY05-06.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Corruption at all levels remains a problem in [LOC Burma  ] , which affects the [MISC GOB’s  ] ability to collect revenue . 
[ORG RANGOON  ] 00000378 004.2 OF 004 While the government cracked down on crooked Customs officials in 2006 , the payment of bribes on the borders continues , according to business contacts . 
Corruption is also rife in other [ORG GOB  ] agencies , including the [ORG Internal Revenue Department  ] , [ORG Immigration  ] , and the [ORG Yangon Central Development Committee  ] . 
Comment ------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While the published budget provides a general guideline of how the [ORG GOB  ] will allocate its funds , the lack of details in the document -- and the general unreliability of [ORG GOB  ] statistics -- make it impossible to obtain an accurate picture of Burma’s fiscal situation . 
This problem is compounded by the lack of spending discipline by senior leaders , who will likely continue allocating money for pet projects with little oversight or regard for planned appropriations . 
Despite the [MISC GOB’s  ] stated intention to reduce the budget deficit , another increase is far more likely due to uncontrolled spending , SOE losses , and the lack of tax reform . 
Burma’s economic future remains troubled .
