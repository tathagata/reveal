REF: [ORG Reykjavik  ] 223 Classified By: DCM [PER Neil Klopfenstein  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . 
1 . 
( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] The [MISC Icelandic  ] economic crisis continues with no end in sight . 
The possibility of a [MISC Russian  ] loan bailout as well as concerns voiced by some [MISC American  ] bankers raise the question of whether greater USG involvement in the crisis is merited . 
The [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG Central Bank  ] announced this morning that its attempts to peg the krona to an index were not working and it would no longer fix the rate . 
The krona devalued , then stabilized later in the day , but there are significant differences in the exchange rate depending on the financial institution . 
The [ORG Financial Supervisory Authority  ] used the powers from emergency legislation to take control of [ORG Glitnir Bank  ] and the takeover went well . 
[ORG Kaupthing  ] remains independent for now ; their [MISC Swedish  ] branch will receive a 700 million USD loan from the [ORG Swedish Central Bank  ] . 
Relations with [LOC Britain  ] are under strain following [LOC UK  ] Chancellor [PER Darling  ] 's announcement that he seized the [LOC UK  ] assets of [MISC Icelandic  ] banks , and the media reported that PM Brown wants to sue the [MISC Icelandic  ] government to refund [MISC British  ] depositors . 
Prime Minister [PER Haarde  ] stressed in a press conference at 4 pm that the current situation would not affect many decades of friendship between [LOC Iceland  ] and the [LOC UK  ] . 
[PER Haarde  ] said he had talked to his colleagues in the [MISC Nordics  ] and that the [MISC Norwegian  ] Prime Minister had offered [MISC Norwegian  ] assistance . 
Regarding the [MISC Russian  ] loan offer , the PM asked at the press conference why [LOC Iceland  ] shouldn't call on the [MISC Russians  ] if they could help ? 
Despite public assertions that some of [LOC Iceland  ] 's friends had failed to provide help , the [ORG Embassy  ] does not believe the Icelanders have adequately checked out all possibilities of cooperation with [LOC U.S.  ] entities . 
We urged [LOC Iceland  ] reps to reach out to [LOC U.S.  ] authorities immediately so that " our friends said no " - means they really asked the right questions . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [ORG Central Bank  ] announced that the fixed rate for the krona was not holding and they would no longer hold the rate . 
The krona devalued a bit , and then stabilized at the end of the day . 
We noticed that the exchange rate varies from institution to institution , which less confidence in the krona abroad . 
The [ORG Central Bank  ] rate is 114 [ORG ISK/USD  ] , [ORG Kaupthing  ] 's rate is 96.7 [ORG ISK/USD  ] and [ORG UBS  ] ( a [MISC Swiss  ] bank ) 's rate is 271 [ORG ISK/USD  ] . 
Today [ORG Landsbanki  ] lowered its daily foreign currency withdrawal limits from 200,000 ISK to just 50,000 ISK. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [ORG Financial Supervisory Authority  ] ( [ORG FME  ] ) took control of [ORG Glitnir Bank  ] last night . 
The [ORG FME  ] has replaced the board of directors and promised similar action as has been taken at [ORG Landsbanki  ] . 
The Minister of [LOC Commerce  ] reported at a press conference at 4 pm that the takeover was smooth and had gone well . 
The only bank of the largest three to remain independent , [ORG Kaupthing  ] , announced that their [MISC Swedish  ] unit was receiving a 5 billion [MISC Swedish  ] krona , or 700 million USD , loan from the [MISC Swedish  ] [ORG Central Bank.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The Director General of the [ORG Economic Department of the Ministry  ] of Finance , [PER Thorsteinn Thorgeirsson  ] , told [ORG Econoff  ] he was very concerned with the deteriorating situation with the [MISC British  ] . 
He pointed to the media reports that Prime Minister [PER Gordon Brown  ] wanted to sue [LOC Iceland  ] over guaranteeing [MISC British  ] deposits in [MISC Icelandic  ] banks in the [LOC UK  ] and [LOC UK  ] Chancellor [PER Darling  ] 's televised speech on the Parliament floor stating that he had seized and frozen assets of [MISC Icelandic  ] banks in [LOC UK  ] . 
In his 4 pm press conference today , Prime Minister [PER Haarde  ] stated that the [MISC Icelandic  ] Government will work with the [MISC British  ] government to find a solution to ensure the [MISC British  ] deposits in the [MISC Icelandic  ] accounts IceSave are safe . 
[PER Haarde  ] added the current situation would not affect many decades of friendship with the [LOC UK.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In reaction to [MISC Icelandic  ] government assertions yesterday that the Icelanders were turning to [LOC Russia  ] because friends ( i.e. , the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) had failed to respond to pleas for help , the [ORG Embassy  ] checked with both [MISC Icelandic  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] institutions to ascertain whether the Icelanders had requested help or advice from other than the [ORG Federal Reserve  ] . 
We have only been able to confirm that [ORG Central Bank  ] officials have talked to the Chairman of the [ORG New York Fed  ] - but not since last week -- and , as [ORG Treasury  ] briefed the ambassador on October 6 , [PER U/S McCormack  ] phoned the Finance Minister that day . 
We are at a loss to explain why the Icelanders have not picked up the phone to discuss what they need and what we might be able to help them with , though the stature of [ORG Central Bank  ] director [PER David Oddsson  ] may have something to do with a reluctance to open other lines of communication . 
[MISC American  ] bankers here tell us that [LOC U.S.  ] support is badly needed , that the [MISC Icelandic  ] bank assets are not toxic , and that their problem is short term liquidity worsened by a crisis of confidence. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [LOC U.S.  ] has strategic interests in the high north and a sturdy security relationship with post-Keflavik [LOC Iceland  ] that both sides have labored to develop . 
Today the [ORG Embassy  ] urged senior reps in the PM 's office and elsewhere to at least explore what confidence-building cooperation ( other than the credit swaps the [ORG Fed  ] turned down ) may be possible to develop . 
We doubt that it would be [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000225 002 OF 002 in the interest of the [LOC U.S.  ] or [ORG NATO  ] for the Icelanders to be beholden to [LOC Russia  ] , however " friendly " the loan terms may be .
