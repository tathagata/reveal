( C ) Summary: Although contacts expressed surprise that Vice President [PER Xi Jinping  ] was not appointed [ORG Central Military Commission  ] Vice Chairman at the four-day [MISC Fourth Plenum  ] of the Seventeenth [ORG CCP Central Committee  ] that concluded September 18 , most cautioned against reading too much into the decision and all stressed that it did not imply significant discord within the [ORG Party .  ] 
Several contacts noted that [ORG Party  ] leadership dynamics and [LOC China  ] 's political situation have changed since 1999 when [PER Hu Jintao  ] was appointed to the [ORG CMC  ] and it is not possible to extrapolate [PER Xi  ] 's political trajectory from past practice . 
All contacts agreed that , despite not being appointed to the [ORG CMC  ] at the [MISC Fourth Plenum  ] , [PER Xi Jinping  ] is still the clear frontrunner to succeed [PER Hu Jintao  ] . 
Some attributed the deferral of [PER Xi  ] 's appointment to leadership uncertainty that [PER Xi  ] 's appointment was the right move at the right time . 
There was consensus among our contacts that , despite a communique touting " intra-Party democracy " and anti-corruption initiatives , the [PER Plenum  ] was essentially devoid of substantive reforms and will not result in any significant policy initiatives . 
Although the [PER Plenum  ] made no decisions on the future of [ORG Xinjiang Party  ] Secretary [PER Wang Lequan  ] , contacts unanimously predicted his political career is " finished . 
" End Summary [PER Plenum  ] Communique ----------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The [MISC Fourth Plenum  ] of the Seventeenth [ORG Chinese Communist Party  ] ( [ORG CCP  ] ) [ORG Central Committee  ] concluded September 18 . 
In keeping with past practice , an official [ORG Xinhua  ] news agency statement announced the release of a [ORG CCP  ] communique outlining the conclusions of the [PER Plenum  ] . 
The [ORG Xinhua  ] summary of the communique noted that the [PER Plenum  ] had approved a " [MISC Decision  ] " calling for increased " intra-party democracy , " party building and anti-corruption initiatives in the face of urgent domestic and international challenges . 
The communique included a reference to the importance of addressing ethnic policy , termed " nationalities work " ( minzu gonzuo ) , and promoting " ethnic unity . 
" The text of the [MISC Decision  ] itself was not publicly released . 
The communique noted that President [PER Hu Jintao  ] had delivered an important speech to the [PER Plenum  ] outlining the challenges confronting the party . 
It highlighted the role of [PER Xi Jinping  ] , who delivered an " explanation " of the [MISC Decision  ] to party members . 
Unlike the [MISC Fourth Plenum of the Sixteenth  ] [ORG Central Committee  ] in 1999 , there was no mention of personnel decisions in the communique following this plenum . 
The widely anticipated appointment of [PER Xi Jinping  ] as Vice Chairman of the [ORG Central Military Commission  ] ( [ORG CMC  ] ) was not included in the document . 
Following the [PER Plenum  ] , the fourth plenary session of the [ORG CCP Central Commission for Discipline and Inspection  ] ( [ORG CCDI  ] ) took place on September 19 and also took up the discussion of anti-corruption initiatives , specifically personal financial declarations for Party members . 
Lack of [ORG CMC  ] Appointment Surprising but Not Significant --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG Chinese Academy of Social Sciences  ] ( [ORG CASS  ] ) Professor of Public Policy [PER Dong Lisheng  ] on September 21 told [PER PolOff  ] that he had been very surprised by the decision not to appoint [PER Xi  ] to the [ORG CMC  ] . 
[PER Dong  ] noted that the [ORG Plenum  ] was the sole venue for such personnel decisions and the outcome of this year 's [ORG Plenum  ] meant that [PER Xi  ] would not receive the [ORG CMC  ] appointment in the near term . 
He discounted speculation , particularly among the [LOC Hong Kong  ] press , that [PER Xi  ] 's appointment would only be deferred until after the October 1 [ORG National Day  ] celebrations noting that the [ORG Party  ] would not use such unorthodox means to effect such an important personnel decision . 
Separately , on September 21 Guangming Ribao Senior Editor [PER Dong Yuyu  ] agreed that the issue of [PER Xi  ] 's [ORG CMC  ] appointment , if it had ever been a subject at the [ORG Plenum  ] , had been deferred for the near term and would not be revived until 2011 at the earliest. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG Communist Party  ] member , [ORG Renmin University Sociology Professor  ] and Vice [PER Dean  ] for [ORG Undergraduate Education Hong Dayong  ] on September 21 cautioned against overemphasizing the 1999 precedent and reading too much into the decision not to elevate [PER Xi  ] . 
The political dynamics of the [ORG Party had  ] changed greatly , and past models of political transition were of little utility in the current environment . 
Guangming Ribao [LOC BEIJING  ] 00002731 002 OF 004 editor [PER Dong Yuyu  ] emphasized that there was no established system dictating the content and pace of [LOC Plenum  ] personnel decisions . 
Many had incorQctly surmised that because [PER Hu Jintao  ] had been appointed to the [ORG CMC  ] at the [MISC Fourth Plenum of the Sixteenth Central Committee  ] , [PER Xi Jinping  ] had to be appointed at the same juncture . 
However , perceptions of the importance of this perceived precedent were inaccurate . 
[ORG CASS  ] 's [PER Dong Lisheng  ] emphasized that a primary factor in deferring the appointment was likely [PER Xi  ] 's short tenure as a member of the [MISC Politburo  ] . 
[PER Dong Lisheng  ] noted that when [PER Hu Jintao  ] was appointed to the [ORG CMC  ] in 1999 he had already been a [MISC Politburo  ] member for seven years . 
In contrast , [PER Xi  ] had only been appointed to the [MISC Politburo  ] two years earlier . 
[PER Xi  ] Still the Frontrunner ------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Guangming Ribao 's [PER Dong Yuyu  ] stressed that [PER Xi Jinping  ] was still the frontrunner to succeed [PER Hu Jintao  ] in 2012 and , in his own opinion , had a " sixty-percent chance " of succeeding [PER Hu  ] in the [ORG Party Chairmanship  ] , Presidency and [ORG CMC  ] Chairmanship . 
He noted that the decision to defer [PER Xi  ] 's elevation to the [ORG CMC  ] was likely made in order to provide him more time to develop as a [ORG Party leader  ] . 
The [ORG Party was  ] also looking to protect itself by affording [PER Xi  ] " less time to make mistakes " in that capacity before eventually taking the [ORG CMC  ] Chairmanship . 
[PER Fang Jinyu  ] , recently retired [LOC Beijing  ] bureau chief of the [ORG Nanfang Ribao Media Group  ] , told PolOff September 14 that [PER Xi  ] remained the only feasible candidate by virtue of his political pedigree and backing by [PER Jiang Zemin  ] , [PER Zeng Qinghong  ] and other retired cadres and that [PER Li Keqiang  ] was not a realistic competitor . 
No Discord within the [MISC Politburo  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG CASS  ] 's [PER Dong Lisheng  ] said that , in his view , the decision was the result of the [ORG Party leadership  ] 's determination to " keep its options open " but did not imply intra-Party discord . 
Guangming 's [PER Dong Yuyu  ] stressed that the failure to elevate [PER Xi  ] did not suggest power struggles within [ORG Party leadership  ] . 
On the contrary , the leadership was united as never before around the principles of protecting its power and the individual vested interests of [MISC Party  ] leaders . 
Deferring the appointment of [PER Xi  ] to the [ORG CMC  ] was a function of the [ORG Party 's  ] more cautious attitude in general rather than any significant disagreements within the [MISC Politburo  ] . 
[ORG CCP-PLA Issues  ] -------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG Renmin University  ] 's [ORG Hong Dayong  ] noted that the [ORG CCP  ] leadership had to be " cautious in how it manages the military " and [PER Xi Jinping  ] still lacked the requisite experience at the highest levels of the [ORG Party leadership  ] for this role . 
[PER Huang Shan  ] , Deputy International Editor of Caijing Magazine , on September 17 ( during the [ORG Plenum  ] ) emphasized that the [ORG Party was  ] conscious of its " lack of authority over the military , " particularly in the wake of the much publicized confrontation between Premier [PER Wen Jiabao  ] and the [ORG PLA  ] during reconstruction efforts after the [LOC Sichuan  ] earthquake and that this issue would inform the outcome of the [ORG Plenum  ] . 
[PER Chen Jieren  ] , News Director at [LOC Youth.cn  ] , a news website operated by the [ORG Communist Youth League  ] and the nephew of [ORG Politburo Standing Committee  ] Member He [MISC Guoqiang  ] , on September 9 told [PER PolOff  ] that conservative members of the [ORG PLA  ] were among the leading critics of the response to the [LOC Xinjiang  ] riots and of the policies of President [PER Hu  ] and Premier [PER Wen  ] ; this was causing much introspection within the [ORG Party .  ] 
Guangming 's [PER Dong Yuyu  ] noted that this theme had been presaged in a speech by [PER Hu Jintao  ] during a July 24 [MISC Politburo  ] study session at which he called for the development of " military-civilian integration " ( junmin rongheshi fazhan ) . 
[PER Dong  ] speculated that this initiative could suggest that the [ORG Party was  ] considering new options for the composition of the [ORG CMC  ] , including a formulation whereby both [PER Xi Jinping  ] and [PER Li Keqiang  ] could be jointly named as Vice Chairmen in the future . 
[ORG Plenum  ] without Substance ------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Guangming Ribao 's [PER Dong Yuyu  ] noted that in other aspects the [ORG Plenum  ] had developed exactly how he had expected , with no meaningful changes to the [ORG Party 's  ] fundamental approach to reform and ideology . 
Echoing references by other contacts ( reftel ) to [PER Hu Jintao  ] 's statement that the [ORG Party BEIJING  ] 00002731 003 OF 004 would " avoid distractions " ( bu zheteng ) , [PER Dong  ] noted that the process of drafting the [ORG Plenum  ] conclusions had been ongoing for the past year and the decision not to deviate from existing policies had been reached long before the [ORG Plenum  ] convened . 
The one significant exception was the inclusion of the reference to " nationalities work " in the communique , [PER Dong Yuyu  ] said , which had been included recently in response to the unrest in [LOC Xinjiang  ] . 
However , like the other purported reform initiatives , this would not translate into any substantive adjustments to ethnic policy . 
A loosening of policies in [LOC Xinjiang  ] and [LOC Tibet  ] would create a backlash against the [ORG Party by the Han  ] majority and was therefore politically untenable . 
[ORG Party Leaders Lack Mandate for Reform  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Speaking to PolOff September 17 ( during the [ORG Plenum  ] ) , Caijing editor [PER Huang Shan  ] predicted that the significant dilution of the political authority of individual [MISC Chinese  ] leaders would inform [ORG Plenum  ] outcomes . 
The lack of a clear political mandate meant there could be no substantive political reforms at the [ORG Plenum  ] or in the near term . 
The [ORG Party had  ] adopted a " wait and see " approach to reform in general and was " absolutely unwilling " to consider any meaningful changes to party ideology or policy . 
Although the [ORG Party was  ] aware that social unrest was a potential challenge to its legitimacy , it would address the issue exclusively through economic policy rather than political reform. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [ORG CASS  ] scholar [PER Dong Lisheng  ] echoed [PER Huang Shan  ] 's comments , noting that that the need for consensus informed all major [ORG Party decisions  ] and was the reason for the lack of any substantive policy initiatives during the [ORG Plenum  ] . 
He noted , however , that the tenor of the [ORG Plenum  ] reflected significant dichotomy within the [ORG Party 's  ] outlook . 
On the one hand , the [ORG Party remained  ] confident that its policies had successfully guided [LOC China  ] through the global financial crisis and had maintained economic growth and general political stability . 
Guangming 's [PER Dong Yuyu  ] echoed these comments , stating that the [ORG Party had  ] a confident ( zihao ) outlook and was touting international praise for the " [LOC Beijing  ] model " of economic development as legitimizing its mandate . 
Both [PER Dong Lisheng  ] and [PER Dong Yuyu  ] individually noted , however that on the other hand the [ORG Party was  ] obsessively preoccupied with perceived threats to its hold on power . 
In this context , the [ORG Party 's  ] overarching near-term goal was the preservation of the status quo , and it would therefore avoid any policy or reform initiatives that could potentially have " unforeseen consequences . 
" <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [ORG CASS  ] 's [PER Dong Lisheng  ] discounted the communique 's references to " intra-party democracy " as restatements of the general principles outlined during the [ORG Seventeenth Party Congress  ] . 
He predicted that the anti-corruption measures discussed during the [ORG Plenum  ] would also not result in any substantive measures to bring rampant graft under control . 
[PER Dong Lisheng  ] noted that , despite the renewed discussion of personal financial disclosure statements during the [LOC CCDI  ] plenary session , disclosure regulations for high-level cadres had been on the books since 1995 but had not been enforced . 
Guangming 's [PER Dong Yuyu  ] noted that the reason that financial disclosure statements had been discussed at the [LOC CCDI  ] session instead of the full [ORG Plenum  ] was because they were impossible to implement . 
[PER Wang Lequan  ] Finished -------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) All contacts agreed that [LOC Xinjiang  ] Uighur [ORG Autonomous Region  ] ( [ORG XUAR  ] ) [ORG Party  ] Secretary [PER Wang Lequan  ] would be replaced in the near term . 
[ORG CASS  ] scholar [PER Dong Lisheng  ] noted that the unprecedented spectacle of ethnic [PER Han Urumqi  ] residents taking to the streets to demand [PER Wang  ] 's resignation shortly after a visit to the [ORG XUAR  ] by [PER Hu Jintao  ] could not go unanswered . 
Caijing Magazine 's [PER Huang Shan  ] suggested that [PER Wang  ] would be reassigned to a semi-retirement position as a [ORG National People 's Congress Committee  ] Chairman around the beginning of the 2010 . 
[MISC Politburo  ] member nephew [PER Chen Jieren  ] noted that the frontrunners to replace [PER Wang  ] included [ORG Hunan Party  ] Secretary [PER Zhang Chunxian  ] , [ORG Tibet Party  ] Secretary [PER Zhang Qingli  ] , and Public Security Minister [PER Meng Jianzhu  ] . 
[PER Chen  ] noted that the [ORG Party 's  ] decision on [PER Wang  ] 's replacement would be an important indicator of how it planned to proceed in [LOC Xinjiang  ] . 
The appointment of [PER Zhang Qingli  ] or [PER Meng  ] would suggest a more hardline , security-focused approach .
