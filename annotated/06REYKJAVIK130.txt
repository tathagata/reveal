( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: [MISC Icelandic  ] Foreign Minister [PER Geir H. Haarde  ] has spent early April trying to diffuse criticism from press and politicians who accuse him of failing to predict the [LOC U.S.  ] decision to draw down [ORG Naval Air Station Keflavik  ] ( [ORG NASKEF  ] ) , and who say he is too passive in letting the [LOC U.S.  ] define [LOC Iceland  ] 's defense needs . 
[PER Haarde  ] 's critics are variously using the base closure issue to argue that [PER Haarde  ] 's [ORG Independence Party  ] is not the guarantor of national security that it has long claimed , that the Government is asleep at the switch , and that [LOC Iceland  ] should join the [ORG European Union  ] . 
We will reward [PER Haarde  ] 's dogged [MISC Atlanticism  ] if we come up with a plan for security post-NASKEF that he can sell to an increasingly skeptical public . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Foreign Minister [PER Haarde  ] used his twice-yearly speech on foreign policy to the [ORG Althingi  ] ( [MISC Icelandic  ] Parliament ) April 6 as a platform to defend himself against criticism that he did not foresee the [LOC U.S.  ] decision to zero out [ORG NASKEF  ] 's budget . 
" The world is constantly changing , even in the short time between reports by the Foreign Minister to the [ORG Althingi  ] on the current aspects of foreign affairs , " [PER Haarde  ] told Parliament. ------------------------------- Changes in Security Environment ------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) [PER Haarde  ] told MPs that the world now faces a variety of threats , ranging from hostile dictatorial states and complex ethnic conflicts to tiny terrorist groups and environmental damage and epidemics . 
" It is not unreasonable , therefore , that [ORG NATO  ] , led by the [LOC United States  ] , is now trying to adapt its defensive capabilities to these new circumstances , " the Foreign Minister said . 
" The membership in [ORG NATO  ] and the [ORG Defense Agreement  ] with the [LOC United States  ] have been the cornerstones of [LOC Iceland  ] 's security policy for over half a century . 
Although one might be led to think otherwise by the recent public debate , the defense cooperation has , indeed , changed in light of the changed world order . 
. .Not changed enough , however , to warrant the sacrifice of an air defense capability for which there is a defined need within [ORG NATO  ] . 
" ------------------------------------------ Base Announcement a `Great Disappointment' ------------------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) Mr. [PER Haarde  ] continued , " Whatever the expectations may have been , it cannot be denied that March 15 was a historic day , and the unilateral decision by the [LOC United States  ] while talks were in progress was a great disappointment and a setback for the defense cooperation . 
The possibility of a revision , or even termination , of the [ORG Defense Agreement  ] cannot be excluded . 
But in light of the fact that the [LOC U.S.  ] Government reiterated its commitments under the 1951 [ORG Defense Agreement  ] , the first step was for [LOC Iceland  ] and the [LOC United States  ] to enter into negotiating on the future of their cooperation . 
" ------------------- Opposition Reaction ------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Since the March 15 announcement that no significant [LOC U.S.  ] military presence will remain in [LOC Iceland  ] after September 30 , 2006 , the Foreign Minister has been ridiculed by editorial cartoonists and opposition political parties , who portray him as being a pawn of the [MISC Americans  ] . 
One editorial cartoon showed Secretary Rice dragging the Foreign Minister along the ground by his ears , telling him , " It is so comfortable dealing with you Icelanders because you can take anything we throw at you . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) An April 4 Morgunbladid op-ed by the [ORG Left Green Party  ] 's chair and his deputy fumed , " It still looks as if everything revolves around what the [LOC United States  ] is willing to do -- with [MISC Icelandic  ] envoys in the role of supplicants . 
" [PER Ossur Skarphensson  ] , former [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) Chair and now an influential MP , remarked in the Althing April 5 , " The Foreign Minister was the only person in the country who believed the [ORG Defense Force  ] would not leave [LOC Iceland  ] . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) [PER Ogmundur Jonasson  ] , MP for the [ORG Left Green Party  ] and a reliably strong critic of [MISC Icelandic  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] foreign policies , quipped that Mr. [PER Haarde  ] 's April 6 speech amounted to " a very good analysis by the Foreign Minister that could have come straight from the [ORG Pentagon  ] . 
" [PER Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir  ] , [ORG SDA  ] Chair and [PER Haarde  ] 's main competition for the Prime Minister 's job in 2007 elections , criticized the government for lacking a policy on security and defense: " They are sitting there with their hands in their laps , with no proposals of their own , waiting for the [LOC United States  ] to make up a new contingency plan for [LOC Iceland  ] . 
These are [LOC Iceland  ] 's willing and steadfast leaders . 
" <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) [PER Gisladottir  ] added ( comment: accurately , in post 's view ; end comment ) that there was a different foreign and defense policy emphasis between the two parties making up the coalition government . 
[PER Haarde  ] 's [ORG Independence Party  ] seems more in favor of cooperation with the [LOC United States  ] , she said , and [PER Asgrimsson  ] 's [ORG Progressive Party  ] with [LOC Europe  ] . 
[PER Gisladottir  ] affirmed that [ORG SDA  ] policy is to work so that [LOC Europe  ] " will be our security community in the future . 
" -------------------- What It [MISC Means For Us  ] -------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: FM [PER Haarde  ] is handling the barbs and public ridicule smoothly so far , and he used his speech to underscore his rationale for taking a `wait and see' attitude toward bilateral defense cooperation . 
EUCOM is due to brief the GOI later this month on how it plans to `replace the base.' 
The EUCOM plan will not satisfy everyone in [LOC Iceland  ] , especially the opposition parties . 
But if it can convey clearly that we continue to offer genuine defense preparedness to this long-time ally , the plan will help not only [LOC Iceland  ] but also [PER Haarde  ] , thus far the most levelheaded of our senior [MISC Icelandic  ] interlocutors .
