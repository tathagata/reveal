( SBU/NF ) Summary . 
During the transition to the [ORG Obama Administration  ] , [LOC London  ] think tanks have been active in discussing [ORG USG  ] and [ORG HMG  ] priorities in [LOC Africa  ] . 
Poloff took the opportunity to poll opinions among [LOC Africa  ] specialists at [LOC Chatham House  ] , [ORG RUSI  ] , the [ORG Royal Africa Society  ] , [ORG Africa Confidential  ] , the [ORG Commonwealth Policy Studies Unit  ] , and [ORG International Crisis Group  ] ( please protect ) . 
The following are issue-by-issue consensus summaries from those discussions: -- HMG’s [LOC Africa  ] policy lacks focus and is unable to internally prioritize its [LOC Africa  ] policy . 
-- [LOC Zimbabwe  ] should/will remain a priority for the [LOC UK  ] for historical reasons , but the [MISC USG’s  ] focus is “surprising , ” as it is largely a contained crisis that should be treated as a regional issue . 
A “tough and quiet” approach should be considered . 
-- [LOC Somalia  ] should be more of a priority for [ORG HMG  ] , given the [MISC UK’s  ] history with the region , the large number of [PER Somali Diaspora  ] in the [LOC UK  ] , and the real security threats that community may present to the [LOC UK  ] . 
-- [LOC Nigeria  ] , especially the [ORG Niger Delta  ] and corruption issues , should be a greater [ORG HMG  ] priority because of [MISC Nigeria’s  ] financial links to the [LOC UK  ] , large [MISC UK-based  ] [PER Diaspora  ] community , and energy potential . 
-- [LOC Sudan  ] , including the [MISC Comprehensive Peace Agreement  ] and the [LOC Darfur  ] crisis , should remain top [ORG USG  ] and [ORG HMG  ] priorities because of the regional impact destabilization would have on the [PER Horn  ] . 
-- [ORG South Africa’s  ] desire for a permanent [ORG UNSC  ] seat should be the leverage point for the [ORG USG  ] and [ORG HMG  ] to actively improve relations with [LOC South Africa  ] . 
-- The global economic downturn will have a greater affect on [LOC Africa  ] than the [ORG IMF  ] and [ORG World Bank  ] are predicting . 
-- Engaging [MISC African  ] [PER Diaspora  ] communities should be a key [ORG USG  ] and [ORG HMG  ] focus , as [LOC Africa  ] is the most politically globalized continent . 
-- Engaging [MISC Muslims  ] in [LOC Africa  ] may be a mechanism to also improve relations with the [LOC Middle East  ] and [LOC South Asia  ] . 
End summary . 
[ORG UK Africa Policy Lacks Direction  ] , Unable to Prioritize --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( SBU/NF ) Most [MISC London-based  ] think tank [LOC Africa  ] specialists thought [ORG HMG  ] had lost its ability to prioritize on [LOC Africa  ] , especially since the October 2008 departure of Prime [ORG Minister’s Special Advisor on Africa  ] and Development [PER Justin Forsyth  ] . 
HMG’s creation of an inter-agency [ORG Defense-Foreign Office-International Development Cabinet  ] Sub-Committee on [LOC Africa  ] , they thought , had not succeeded in resolving internal [ORG HMG  ] disputes over priorities in [LOC Africa  ] . 
Given the [MISC UK’s  ] credit crunch and diminishing international influence , the [LOC Chatham House Africa  ] specialist asserted , [ORG HMG  ] should be trying to burden share on [LOC Africa  ] with the [MISC French  ] and the [ORG EU  ] . 
[ORG HMG  ] , however , has not done that effectively and is therefore spreading itself too thin , resulting in a lack of tangible impact in areas of strategic [MISC British  ] interest. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [ORG Embassy  ] comment: [PER Forsyth  ] , while hit-or-miss on follow through , was generally able to corral [LOC UK  ] government departments into setting [MISC African  ] priorities: [LOC Sudan  ] , [LOC Zimbabwe  ] , and [LOC Nigeria  ] . 
FCO Minister for [LOC Africa  ] [PER Mark Malloch-Brown  ] has tried to provide direction ( ref A ) , but his “nice guy” approach of dealing directly with [MISC African  ] leaders through his well-established network of contacts , coupled with the lack-luster direction of the new FCO [LOC Africa  ] Director [PER Adam LONDON  ] 00000339 002 OF 003 [PER Wood  ] ( ref B ) , has meant no serious consideration of the [MISC UK’s  ] priorities in [LOC Africa  ] . 
The [ORG UK’s National Security Strategy  ] also failed to provide any direction , though efforts are underway to improve the document ( ref C ) . 
[PER Brendan Cox  ] , [ORG former Crisis Action  ] head , is due to replace [PER Forsyth  ] at [LOC No. 10  ] in mid-February , but many of those with whom we spoke questioned if he will have the political capital to make any real impact on the [MISC UK’s  ] [LOC Africa  ] policy , given Prime Minister [PER Brown’s  ] standing in the domestic polls and need to focus on the global economic situation . 
End comment . 
[LOC Zimbabwe  ] -------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( SBU/NF ) Several think tank analysts thought that [LOC Zimbabwe  ] should and will remain a top priority for the [LOC UK  ] , but that HMG’s history of bombastic statements has only served to solidify President [PER Mugabe’s status  ] as a colonial liberation leader and rallied [ORG South Africa’s  ] unwavering support . 
From a strategic perspective , these analysts termed the [MISC USG’s  ] focus on [LOC Zimbabwe  ] as “surprising” because [LOC Zimbabwe  ] is not a threat , but largely a contained crisis . 
They said that [MISC Zimbabwe’s  ] crisis should be treated as a regional issue , not an international one , and that the [ORG USG  ] should not sacrifice it’s relations with [LOC South Africa  ] , the more strategic partner , over [LOC Zimbabwe  ] , even if the political events in [LOC Zimbabwe  ] run contrary to the [MISC USG’s  ] democracy agenda . 
They recommended the international community take a “tough and quiet” approach to [PER Mugabe  ] and [MISC ZANU-PF  ] , sanctioning and obstructing their personal freedoms but without commenting publicly . 
They asserted that the international community’s concern about [LOC Zimbabwe  ] being a regional destabilizer is largely unfounded , as most of the [ORG Southern Africa Development Community  ] ( [ORG SADC  ] ) - especially [LOC South Africa  ] - “can take of themselves.” [LOC Somalia  ] ------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( SBU/NF ) Given the [MISC UK’s  ] history , the large number of [PER Somali Diaspora  ] in the [LOC UK  ] , and the real security threats that community may present to the [LOC UK  ] , think tank security specialists thought [LOC Somalia  ] should be more of a priority for [ORG HMG  ] . 
[ORG HMG  ] , they argued , should be more innovative on [LOC Somalia  ] policy , focusing on local community engagement and finding humanitarian and social initiatives where material benefit can be derived without deployment of an excessively large peacekeeping force . 
The [ORG RUSI Africa  ] specialist said [ORG HMG  ] and the [MISC USG’s  ] previous entry point to [LOC Somalia  ] was through [LOC Ethiopia  ] . 
With the withdrawal of [MISC Ethiopian  ] troops , a new entry point should be found quickly . 
He thought both [ORG IGAD  ] and the [ORG AU  ] could serve in this capacity . 
He also asserted that recognition of [LOC Somaliland  ] should be considered to allow it access to international mechanisms for development and capacity support , as well as to support its democratic development in the face of increasing [MISC Islamic  ] militant pressures. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [ORG Embassy  ] comment . 
Cabinet office officials have told us that they consider [LOC Somalia  ] a serious security concern , but they have not been able to induce other [ORG HMG  ] departments to move on it , in large part because of the failure of the [ORG HMG  ] process to set [LOC Africa  ] priorities . 
HMG’s budget crunch also seems to be hindering the decision-making process ( ref D ) . 
End comment . 
[LOC Nigeria  ] ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( SBU/NF ) Think tank [LOC West Africa  ] specialists , citing [MISC Nigeria’s  ] significant financial links to the [LOC UK  ] , large [PER Diaspora  ] community , and energy potential , said that the country , especially the [ORG Niger Delta  ] and corruption issues , should be a clear [ORG HMG  ] priority , but it has not been . 
HMG’s capacity for political analysis on [LOC Nigeria  ] , they thought , was both “weak and shallow.” The [ORG RUSI  ] security specialist said [LOC Nigeria  ] , as well as [LOC Africa  ] as a whole , needs better maritime security and should be able to secure its ports . 
Weak land and maritime security , combined with fragile state and government institutions , is an integrated problem in [LOC Nigeria  ] , he asserted. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [ORG Embassy  ] comment: Although the [ORG Foreign Office  ] appears interested in developing a more focused and strategic policy on [LOC Nigeria  ] , the Home Office’s drive to conclude a [LOC LONDON  ] 00000339 003 OF 003 prisoner transfer agreement has prevented [ORG HMG  ] from moving forward on any other meaningful issues ( refs E , F , and G ) . 
End comment . 
[LOC Sudan  ] ----- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( SBU/NF ) All the think tank analysts consulted agreed that [LOC Sudan  ] , including implementation of the [MISC Comprehensive Peace Agreement  ] ( [ORG CPA  ] ) and finding a political solution to the [LOC Darfur  ] crisis , should remain top [ORG HMG  ] and [ORG USG  ] priorities because of the regional impact destabilization of [LOC Sudan  ] would have on the entire [LOC Horn of Africa  ] . 
[LOC South Africa  ] ------------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( SBU/NF ) These analysts also all agreed that now was the time for both [ORG HMG  ] and the [ORG USG  ] to improve relations with [LOC South Africa  ] . 
It is time to mend fences , especially for the [LOC UK  ] , and [ORG South Africa’s  ] desire for a permanent [ORG UN Security Council  ] seat as part of [ORG UNSC  ] reform , should be the leverage point , they asserted . 
[LOC South Africa  ] , they assessed , has the potential to break up unhelpful [MISC African  ] voting blocks in the [ORG UN  ] , in spite of its “diplomatically difficult” time during its recent rotation on the [ORG Security Council  ] . 
The [ORG Global Economic Downturn and Africa  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( SBU/NF ) Royal [MISC African  ] Society specialists thought the global economic downturn would affect [LOC Africa  ] significantly , much more than the [ORG IMF  ] and [ORG World Bank  ] have been reporting , because of falling commodity prices . 
Increased unemployment , they thought , would likely increase urban unrest and destabilize individual nations’ security . 
Engaging the [PER Diaspora  ] --------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( SBU/NF ) Several think tank specialists noted the importance of the [MISC African  ] [PER Diaspora  ] . 
With the global credit crunch , they thought , the [MISC African  ] Diaspora’s role will be increasingly important , both economically and politically . 
They asserted that [LOC Africa  ] is the most politically globalized continent , even if it is not economically globalized . 
They indicated that [ORG HMG  ] and the [ORG USG  ] should find ways for the [PER Diaspora  ] to constructively engage on the continent , which will influence [MISC African  ] governments in favor of [MISC Western  ] values , as most large , affluent [MISC African  ] [PER Diaspora  ] communities are based in the [LOC West  ] . 
[LOC Islam  ] ----- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( SBU/NF ) The [ORG RUSI Africa  ] specialist suggested that [ORG HMG  ] and the [ORG USG  ] should do more to engage [MISC Muslims  ] in [LOC Africa  ] , as it is an easier entry point for fostering goodwill that may transmit to more difficult geographic areas , like the [LOC Middle East  ] and [LOC South Asia  ] .
