( C ) Madam Secretary , Mission [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] warmly welcomes your visit to the [LOC Kingdom  ] , a country which , by virtue of its energy resources , financial power , counterterrorism efforts , and leadership of the [MISC Muslim  ] world , plays a critical role in many global and regional issues of importance to us . 
Your visit comes at a time of emerging opportunities for engagement to advance the goals that you and the President have laid out in your speeches in the region. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Our alliance with [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , while complicated and subject to occasional disjunctions , has proven durable . 
Taking stock of where we stand , we see a mixed picture . 
The good news is that the [MISC Saudi  ] leadership still sees the [LOC United States  ] as its most important strategic partner and guarantor of its stability . 
We also share many global and regional objectives , including the need for global financial and energy stability , a common view of threats posed by terrorism and extremism , the dangers posed by [LOC Iran  ] and destabilization in [LOC Pakistan  ] , and the linkage that progress toward [LOC Middle East  ] peace has to virtually all other regional issues . 
Finally , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] has become one of our most important allies in the fight against [ORG Al-Qaida  ] and terror financing. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The bad news is that we differ on tactics in some key objectives , and we are often frustrated by [MISC Saudi  ] unresponsiveness and a dearth of interlocutors among an aging collective leadership . 
The status of women , religious freedom , and human rights are ongoing concerns . 
On the [MISC Saudi  ] side , [PER King Abdullah  ] believes we are not always reliable , consistent , or willing to heed his advice on important issues such as [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[PER Saud Al-Faisal  ] and others have openly been critical of [LOC U.S.  ] policies they describe as having shifted the regional balance of power in favor of arch-rival [LOC Iran  ] . 
Differences of opinion on some of these issues can be exacerbated by our differing cultures and value systems , which can introduce a degree of skepticism and hesitancy in the relationship. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Despite the problems , a negative assessment of the bilateral relationship would miss a critical point relevant to [LOC U.S.  ] goals in the region: [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] is a country in transition , and the changes underway present opportunities for engagement that can advance [LOC U.S.  ] interests and national security . 
[LOC Saudi Arabia  ] faces transitions on multiple levels , from the geopolitical , where its trade and energy relations are shifting from west to east , to economic , where greater integration in the world economy is steadily exposing [MISC Saudis  ] to international best practices . 
Domestically , greater access to internet and cell phones is unleashing new forms of social activism , something demonstrated by an outpouring of [MISC Saudi  ] spontaneous voluntary assistance in the aftermath of the [LOC Jeddah  ] floods . 
EDUCATION & DIVERSIFICATION TO COMBAT EXTREMISM --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Having faced down what amounted to an insurgency by [ORG Al-Qaida  ] from 2003 to 2006 , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] 's leadership acknowledged the pressing need for systemic reforms to combat extremist ideology and provide for a rapidly expanding population ( the annual growth rate is about 2 percent ) . 
[PER King Abdullah  ] 's strategy is two-pronged: he has attacked the roots of the extremism that fed [ORG Al-Qaida  ] through education and judicial reforms to weaken the influence of the most reactionary elements of [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] 's religious establishment . 
He is also promoting economic diversification . 
The King is keenly aware of the urgent need to make [MISC Saudi  ] education more relevant to today 's workplace and increase the role of women in the economy , goals which remain controversial in this deeply conservative , inward-looking desert [LOC Kingdom  ] . 
Guided by a vision that dovetails with some key elements of the President 's [LOC Cairo  ] speech , King [PER Abdullah  ] has begun to implement an ambitious plan to transform [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] 's economy away from excessive [LOC RIYADH  ] 00000178 002 OF 005 reliance on hydrocarbons and towards a knowledge-based economy that can provide sustainable development for the long-term . 
Achieving these goals will require nothing short of a revolution in the education system and significant changes in most aspects of [MISC Saudi  ] society , especially the status of women. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) Seen from the outside , the pace of political reform seems glacial ( a notable exception is that changes introduced after the WTO negotiations have been very fast for any country ; regulatory agencies are also standing up quickly ) . 
Yet for certain elements of [MISC Saudi  ] society , the changes are coming too fast . 
Whatever the pace , however , the reality is that serious reforms are gradually but irrevocably changing [MISC Saudi  ] society . 
Recently implemented reform measures include re-shuffling the [ORG Ministry of Education  ] 's leadership last February ( bringing in the King 's pro-reform son-in-law as the new minister ) ; a top-to-bottom restructuring of the country 's courts to introduce , among other things , review of judicial decisions and more professional training for [MISC Shari'a  ] judges ; the creation of a new investment promotion agency to overhaul the once-convoluted process of starting a business here ; the creation of a regulatory body for capital markets ; the construction of the [ORG King Abdullah University for Science and Technology  ] ( the country 's new flagship and controversially-coed institution for advanced scientific research ) ; and a substantial budgetary investment in educating the workforce for future jobs . 
The [MISC Saudi  ] government is also encouraging the development of non-hydrocarbon sectors in which the [ORG Kingdom  ] has a comparative advantage , including mining , solar energy , and religious tourism . 
The [ORG Kingdom  ] 's 2010 budget reflects these priorities -- about 25 percent is devoted to education alone -- and amounts to a significant economic stimulus package . 
[LOC U.S.  ] PARTNERSHIPS TO SUPPORT REFORM & [ORG ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Saudi  ] officials have been candid in stressing the importance they place on strong ties with the [LOC United States  ] to help them meet reform challenges , both through increased engagement at the government level , including educational exchanges and more [ORG FDI  ] , particularly in energy , high tech , and manufacturing . 
The past year has seen several large investments by prominent [LOC U.S.  ] firms in advanced technology areas , and we are working to raise the profile of our trade and investment relations , including through a major [MISC Saudi  ] exposition in [LOC Chicago  ] at the end of April . 
The [ORG Mission  ] has also steadily expanded USG engagement in education , public health , science & technology , entrepreneurship , and civil society . 
There are now more than 22,000 [MISC Saudi  ] students studying in the [LOC US  ] , exceeding pre-9/11 levels . 
Public health engagement has included breast cancer awareness and [ORG CDC  ] cooperation to set up an advanced epidemic screening network that protected this year , s 3 million [PER Hajj  ] pilgrims . 
Our Science & Technology umbrella agreement is already expanding cooperation , including new projects with [ORG NASA  ] . 
Our MEPI programs include a first-time ever exchange visit by a group of [MISC Saudi  ] judges , leadership development for women , prevention of violence against women and children , and youth exchange and study . 
One female participant in our [MISC Social Entrepreneurship Forum  ] was a finalist in the 2009 Global Student Entrepreneur Awards . 
She and seven other [MISC Saudi  ] entrepreneurs will attend the President 's April summit . 
[ORG Mission  ] elements have also provided training to help the [ORG SAG  ] implement a new law to combat trafficking in persons . 
Intensive engagement with the [ORG SAG  ] on [ORG IPR  ] is another success story . 
You will want to congratulate [MISC Saudi  ] officials for the significant progress [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] has made over the last several years in improving [ORG IPR  ] protection , which resulted in the Special 301 Committee deciding to remove [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] from the [ORG Watch List  ] . 
[MISC SAUDI  ] STRATEGIC CALCULATIONS ---------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) TURNING EAST: [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] is trying to come to terms with the shift in global energy and trade ties towards [LOC Asia  ] , [ORG RIYADH  ] 00000178 003 OF 005 which has both political and economic consequences . 
Bilateral trade with [LOC China  ] has more than tripled , and [LOC China  ] will soon be [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , s largest importer . 
[LOC Saudi Arabia  ] has also committed significant investments in [LOC China  ] , including the $8 billion [LOC Fujian  ] refinery . 
Increased trade has also brought increased friction , including anti-dumping complaints from both sides . 
[LOC Saudi Arabia  ] is thinking through how best to take a leaf from the [MISC Chinese  ] playbook and use these expanded trade ties to achieve important political goals . 
In this regard , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] has told the [MISC Chinese  ] that it is willing to effectively trade a guaranteed oil supply in return for [MISC Chinese  ] pressure on [LOC Iran  ] not to develop nuclear weapons. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) COUNTERING IRAN: We expect that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] will continue to develop its ties with [LOC China  ] , in part to counterbalance relations with the [LOC West  ] . 
While the King 's preference is to cooperate with the [LOC U.S.  ] , he has concluded that he needs to proceed with his own strategy to counter [MISC Iranian  ] influence in the region , which includes rebuilding Riyadh-Cairo-Damascus coordination , supporting [MISC Palestinian  ] reconciliation , supporting the [MISC Yemeni  ] government , and expanding relations with non-traditional partners such as [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC China  ] , and [LOC India  ] to create diplomatic and economic pressure on [LOC Iran  ] that do not directly depend on [LOC U.S.  ] help . 
The [PER King  ] told General [PER Jones  ] that if [LOC Iran  ] succeeded in developing nuclear weapons , everyone in the region would do the same , including [LOC Saudi Arabia.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [PER King  ] is convinced that current [LOC U.S.  ] engagement efforts with [LOC Tehran  ] will not succeed ; he is likely to feel grimly vindicated in his view by [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's February 11 boast that having successfully enriched uranium to a level of 20 percent , [LOC Iran  ] " is now a nuclear nation . 
" The [PER King  ] told General [PER Jones  ] that [MISC Iranian  ] internal turmoil presented an opportunity to weaken the regime -- which he encouraged -- but he also urged that this be done covertly and stressed that public statements in support of the reformers were counterproductive . 
The [PER King  ] assesses that sanctions could help weaken the government , but only if they are strong and sustained . 
The [PER King  ] will want you to elaborate on the President 's statement that the time for sanctions has come . 
He will also want to hear our plans for bolstering [LOC Gulf  ] defenses vis a vis [LOC Iran  ] . 
( The [PER King  ] has invited General [PER Petraeus  ] to his desert camp for discussion on this topic on Tuesday . 
) <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) CLIMATE CHANGE: Your visit offers an important opportunity to head off a serious clash over climate change . 
[MISC Saudi  ] officials are very concerned that a climate change treaty would significantly reduce their income just as they face significant costs to diversify their economy . 
We want to get beyond the obstructionism that [MISC Saudi  ] negotiators have often shown during the negotiations and persuade senior leaders to work with us in a partnership to meet their strategic concerns , including by cooperating on developing solar and biomass energy . 
The [PER King  ] is particularly sensitive to avoid [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] being singled out as the bad actor , particularly on environmental issues . 
Your conveying the importance the President places on working as partners with [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] on the [LOC Copenhagen  ] process will be very important in making this dialogue more constructive . 
Secretary [PER Chu  ] intends to explore specific areas of collaboration during his February 21-23 visit . 
[MISC SAUDI  ] REGIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS -------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( S ) PREVENTING A COLLAPSE OF YEMEN: [MISC Saudi  ] participation in international diplomatic efforts to stabilize [LOC Yemen  ] reflect [MISC Saudi  ] fears that instability on its southern border is a clear and present danger . 
The [PER King  ] will tell you that [LOC Yemen  ] 's strategic location makes an [ORG Al-Qaida  ] presence there more threatening than in [LOC Afghanistan  ] ; he will stress the need to support [MISC Yemeni  ] unity , despite his mistrust of [PER Ali Abdullah Saleh  ] . 
With respect to [MISC Saudi  ] involvement in the war against the [ORG Houthis  ] , the [PER King  ] will stress that the [ORG SAG  ] 's motivation was self-defense . 
As [ORG Al-Qaida  ] infiltrators from [LOC Yemen  ] multiplied , the [ORG SAG  ] concluded that the [MISC Houthi  ] rebellion had distracted [PER Saleh  ] 's government to the detriment of [MISC Saudi  ] [ORG RIYADH  ] 00000178 004 OF 005 security . 
The military intervention was triggered by a [MISC Houthi  ] incursion into [MISC Saudi  ] territory , but it presented a long-sought excuse to fortify the porous [MISC Saudi-Yemeni  ] border . 
On February 7 , [PER Prince Khalid  ] also informed Ambassador Smith the fighting is wrapping up , and that a ceasefire arrangement could be in place by mid-February. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) GESTURES AFTER ALL ? : The [PER King  ] appreciates the President 's commitment to [LOC Middle East  ] peace but is skeptical the [LOC U.S.  ] can bring sufficient and sustained pressure to bear on [LOC Israel  ] , especially regarding settlements . 
The [PER King  ] told General [PER Jones  ] that progress on [LOC Middle East  ] peace was only possible if President [PER Obama  ] was willing to pressure [LOC Israel  ] , and [MISC Saudi  ] officials have rebuffed [LOC U.S.  ] requests for confidence-building gestures to help restart negotiations . 
Despite their adamant rhetoric , however , several members of a private [MISC Jeddah-based  ] think tank run by a retired [MISC Saudi  ] general have very quietly been participating in Track Two discussions , apparently with [ORG SAG  ] knowledge , and even put forward a proposal on [LOC Gaza  ] . 
In a more dramatic public encounter that has provoked commotion in the region , former [MISC Saudi  ] Ambassador to the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Prince Turki  ] Al-Faisal shook hands with [MISC Israeli  ] Deputy FM Ayalon to settle a dispute over joint seating at a [LOC Munich  ] conference . 
Both sides have since insisted the gesture did not signal changes in policy , with a " senior [MISC Saudi  ] diplomat " issuing a statement emphatically denying that the incident constituted any form of recognition for [LOC Israel.  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) AFGHANISTAN/PAKISTAN: King [PER Abdullah  ] firmly believes that [PER Asif Zardari  ] is the primary obstacle to the government 's ability to move unequivocally to end terrorist safe havens there ( " when the head is rotten , it affects the whole body " ) . 
The [PER King  ] told General [PER Jones  ] that [LOC U.S.  ] development assistance would rebuild trust with the [ORG Army  ] , which he asserted was staying out of politics in deference to [LOC U.S.  ] wishes , rather than doing what it " should . 
" On [LOC Afghanistan  ] , the [PER King  ] has expressed support for the new [LOC U.S.  ] strategy , saying that spending on roads , schools , hospitals and mosques would dissipate popular mistrust and help rebuild the country . 
The [PER King  ] has not yet acknowledged the [MISC Saudi  ] role in [MISC Taliban  ] mediation in conversations with [MISC USG  ] officials ; GIP Director [PER Prince Muqrin  ] has explained to several recent [MISC USG  ] visitors that the [ORG SAG  ] prefers to keep such discussions in intelligence channels until any agreement is reached . 
Perhaps reflecting this , the [MISC Saudi  ] media downplayed President [PER Karzai  ] 's recent visit and the [MISC Afghan  ] Ambassador reported that the meeting with the King lasted only ten minutes . 
A NOTE ABOUT THE KING --------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) The Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques will offer you a traditional [MISC Saudi  ] welcome at the desert " encampment " outside [LOC Riyadh  ] , where he likes to spend his winter vacations . 
You will find in 86-year old King [PER Abdullah  ] a wry and forthright interlocutor . 
Having struggled with a speech impediment throughout his life , he tends to express himself tersely . 
Reflecting his [MISC Bedouin  ] roots , he judges his counterparts on the basis of character , honesty , and trust . 
He expects commitments to be respected and sees actions , not words , as the true test of commitment ; and he expects good-faith consultations , not surprises . 
Once the [PER King  ] has lost trust in a counterpart , as has been the case with [PER Nouri Al-Maliki  ] or [PER Asif Zardari  ] , his personal antipathy can become a serious obstacle to bilateral relations . 
On the other hand , as with President [PER Obama  ] , the [PER King  ] 's esteem will help navigate differences and at times change policies . 
The [PER King  ] is undoubtedly looking forward to his discussions with you , and [LOC Mission  ] [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] enthusiastically looks forward to supporting your visit . 
[ORG MISSION STAFFING  ] ---------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( U ) The [LOC U.S. Mission  ] in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] includes Embassy [LOC Riyadh  ] , and Consulate Generals [LOC Dhahran  ] and [LOC Jeddah  ] . 
The entire [ORG Mission  ] , representing ten agencies , consists of 605 staff ( 212 [MISC U.S. Direct  ] Hire ( [ORG USDH  ] ) and 393 Locally Engaged [ORG RIYADH  ] 00000178 005 OF 005 ( [ORG LE  ] ) staff ) .
