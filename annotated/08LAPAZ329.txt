( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] The [MISC Bolivian  ] government attempted to renew and , in some cases , repackage old allegations against the [LOC U.S.  ] February 16-18 . 
[MISC Bolivian  ] President [PER Evo Morales  ] threatened to show [ORG USAID  ] the door if it continues undermining his administration . 
As proof , [PER Morales  ] provided the example of a political organization that was allegedly turned down for [ORG USAID  ] assistance due to its pro-Morales stance . 
He also cited unnamed groups that were asked to work against the government as a condition for assistance . 
[PER Morales  ] also argued against a free trade agreement with the [LOC U.S.  ] and charged the [LOC U.S.  ] of involvement in the disappearances of [MISC Bolivians  ] during drug-related conflicts in the region of [LOC Chapare  ] . 
[LOC Morales'  ] assertion that pro-government groups were prepared to take up arms to defend his agenda were rebuffed by a wide-range of social and labor groups . 
Government Minister [PER Alfredo Rada  ] continues to accuse the [LOC U.S.  ] of involvement in a police " spying " scandal to deflect from his role in the unauthorized surveillance of opposition politicians and reporters . 
The [MISC Bolivian  ] government 's refusal to sign a cooperation agreement concerning [LOC U.S.  ] military aid and the impact of that refusal on disaster assistance was made public February 18 . 
Foreign Minister [PER David Choquehuanca  ] explained the government did not want to sign an agreement " with its eyes closed " and was only reviewing the agreement . 
Despite public assurances that they want better relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] , the relentless public spinning of the [MISC Bolivian  ] government 's complaints against the [LOC U.S.  ] at the expense of diplomatic channels suggest the [ORG BOG  ] has another agenda: discredit the [LOC U.S.  ] and distract the [MISC Bolivian  ] public . 
End Summary . 
Lights , Camera , Allegations --------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) [MISC Bolivian  ] President [PER Evo Morales  ] made several references to ongoing " political problems " with the [LOC U.S.  ] February 15 , although he clarified diplomatic and commercial relations would be maintained . 
[PER Morales  ] rehashed the argument that [ORG USAID  ] is supporting opposition groups and that the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Embassy  ] is " making politics " at the expense of diplomatic work , such as advancing commercial ties . 
[PER Morales  ] asserted during recent months [ORG USAID  ] has been convoking groups through implementing [ORG NGOs  ] and offering them money with the stipulation that they work " against the [MISC Bolivian  ] government . 
" [PER Morales  ] claimed leaders from the [ORG Federation of Ayllus  ] ( indigenous local government units ) of [LOC Potosi  ] told him an USAID-supported NGO denied their group 's request for $20,000 because the organization " supports [PER Evo Morales  ] . 
" [PER Morales  ] urged citizens to report [ORG NGOs  ] that are " bought by [ORG USAID  ] to distribute funds to make politics against the government . 
" He added , " The government will not allow [ORG NGOs  ] to work against the executive power . 
Faced with these provocations from [ORG USAID  ] , we will ask them to go home . 
" [PER Morales  ] saluted [LOC U.S.  ] citizens that are denouncing both [ORG USAID  ] and the [MISC Embassy  ] for practicing " politics , " but offered no details on who he was referring to. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Although most of his criticisms were respun from old charges , [PER Morales  ] added a new spin on some existing allegations . 
[PER Morales  ] asserted Embassy [MISC Bolivian  ] police guards act " like embassy workers ... at the side of the [LOC U.S.  ] government . 
" [PER Morales  ] claimed he learned of this " strange " police arrangement through Fulbrighter van [PER Schaick  ] , who accused [ORG Assistant Regional Security  ] Officer [PER Vincent Cooper  ] of asking him to " spy " on [MISC Cubans  ] and [MISC Venezuelans  ] in [LOC Bolivia  ] last week ( Reftels a and b ) . 
Though not directly associated with recent charges the [LOC U.S.  ] is behind [MISC Bolivian  ] police " spying " on politicians and reporters , this mischaracterization of our [MISC Bolivian  ] guard force feeds into the [PER Morales  ] administration 's allegations of undue [LOC U.S.  ] influence on [MISC Bolivian  ] police units . 
Evo on FTA , Drugs , and [PER Cooper  ] " Expulsion " ----------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Morales  ] rejected a free trade agreement with the [LOC U.S.  ] as a return to the days of former-president [PER Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada  ] , when [PER Morales  ] alleges the government made deals with [LOC U.S.  ] businesses at the expense of [MISC Bolivians  ] . 
[PER Morales  ] characterized the [MISC Embassy  ] 's decision that ARSO [PER Vincent Cooper  ] would not return to [LOC Bolivia  ] as the " expulsion " of a " man who conducted [MISC North American  ] espionage . 
" [PER Morales  ] repeated his opinion that the war on drugs has been a failure because it targeted coca leaf instead of cocaine . 
He alleged the [ORG DEA  ] , [LOC U.S.  ] military , and [MISC Bolivian  ] national police headed [MISC Bolivian  ] anti-narcotics efforts " from a [LOC U.S.  ] military base " in [ORG Cochabamba Department  ] when there were " demonstrations and disappearances , " implying [LOC U.S.  ] involvement . 
( Note: The [LOC U.S.  ] supports [MISC Bolivian  ] anti-narcotics efforts at the [ORG Chimore Airport  ] and has offices there , but there are no [LOC U.S.  ] military bases per se in [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
Despite [LOC Morales'  ] intermittent calls to dismantle such non-existent bases , this issue is a misunderstanding or a straw man . 
End Note . 
) Call to Arms Disconnected ------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) While railing against " oligarchic groups , " and particularly efforts to convoke an autonomy referendum in the [ORG opposition-led Department  ] ( state ) of [LOC Santa Cruz  ] , [PER Morales  ] claimed pro-government groups would defend his administration " with arms . 
" [PER Morales  ] said February 14 that sympathizers in [LOC Santa Cruz  ] had told him they would take up arms to ensure the opposition showed [PER Morales  ] the proper " respect . 
" However , leaders from MAS-aligned social and union groups rejected any attempt to resort to arms February 16 , calling instead for an electoral solution to settle [MISC Bolivian  ] differences . 
Spin Doctor [PER Rada  ] 's Dizzying " Spy " Accusations --------------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) On February 15 , the Ambassador met with Government Minister [PER Alfredo Rada  ] to discuss the [ORG USG  ] 's support to the Police 's [ORG Special Operations Command  ] ( [ORG COPES  ] ) police unit , a unit that [PER Rada  ] has stated was likely behind a growing domestic surveillance scandal . 
Following their meeting , the Ambassador issued a public statement which re-iterated that the [ORG USG  ] was never involved in domestic spying and explained that [ORG USG  ] would no longer fund [ORG COPES  ] because the unit had been disbanded on January 29. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) In an interview with the [ORG La Paz  ] newspaper [ORG La Prensa  ] following the February 15 meeting [PER Rada  ] continued to insinuate ) - as he has done publicly on various occasions -- that [ORG COPES  ] was responsible for internal surveillance against political officials and journalists . 
[PER Rada  ] once again called [ORG COPES  ] a parallel intelligence organization that conducted " political intelligence , " argued it reported directly to the [ORG USG  ] and not to the [ORG National Intelligence Directorate  ] ( [ORG DNI  ] ) , and that it exceeded the scope of its mandate . 
[PER Rada  ] explained that since September 11 , 2001 the [LOC U.S.  ] government had directed [ORG COPES  ] to gather intelligence on terrorist organizations which violated [MISC COPES'  ] mission to conduct surveillance only on narco-trafficking organizations . 
[PER Rada  ] stated , that " terrorism is a fundamentally political phenomenon . . . therefore [ORG COPES  ] . . . conducted political intelligence . . . 
All of this a function of the [ORG State Department  ] 's priorities . 
" ( Note: According to the [MISC COPES'  ] memorandum of understanding between the [MISC Bolivian  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] governments , conducting surveillance on both illegal narcotics and terrorist targets is part of its mission . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) Throughout the interview Minister [PER Rada  ] engaged in double speak , at times strongly insinuating the [ORG USG  ] was behind the domestic spying scandal , at other times acknowledging there was little information tying the [ORG USG  ] to the case . 
" It would be irresponsible to affirm they ( the [MISC Embassy  ] ) were behind these ( domestic spying ) operations , " [PER Rada  ] stated . 
He followed with , " The fact that intelligence personnel from the [MISC Embassy  ] received reports from ODEP ( [MISC COPES'  ] official name since 2001 ) makes us believe that they were aware of these things ( domestic spying ) . 
Despite earlier statements in the interview that [ORG COPES  ] responded to the [ORG USG  ] , [PER Rada  ] closed the interview with the statement , " That [MISC ODEP-COPES  ] followed direct orders from the [MISC Embassy  ] , we cannot yet demonstrate , but we are investigating . 
But there was a direct economic link , and it has been demonstrated that they worked on priorities designed by [LOC Washington  ] . 
" [PER Rada  ] also tried to link Fulbrighter [PER Van Schaick  ] case to the domestic spy scandal . 
Arguing his [PER Van Schaick  ] 's sworn statement is the first piece of concrete evidence that links the [ORG USG  ] to espionage within [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
Eyes Wide Shut on [ORG MILGP Assistance  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The [MISC Bolivian  ] press reported February 19 that the [MISC Bolivian  ] government had frozen military humanitarian assistance , by not renewing our humanitarian assistance diplomatic note ( which acts as a [ORG SOFA  ] , or status of forces agreement , for [LOC U.S.  ] military personnel in [LOC Bolivia  ] ) . 
The article stressed that non-military aid ( USD ) 600,000 to flood victims is not affected . 
However , it highlighted that our MILGRP has provided humanitarian assistance ( include medical , dental and eye treatment ) since 1996 and has already prevented aid from arriving for flooding victims . 
Foreign Minister [PER David Choquehuanca  ] responded that the government had not canceled any agreement , but was simply reviewing it . 
[PER Choquehuanca  ] stated , " We now do not sign agreements with the [LOC United States  ] with our eyes closed , like what happened in the past , especially with anti-drug assistance . 
" ( Note: The humanitarian assistance agreement has nothing to do with our counter-narcotics aid . 
A [MISC Bolivian  ] diplomatic note suspended renewal of the assistance agreement January 29 , citing the need for a dialogue to bridge a " gap of understanding . 
" ( ( Reftel C ) ) End Note ) . 
Comment ------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Although charges that [ORG USAID  ] is undermining the [MISC Bolivian  ] government are nothing new ( Minister of the Presidency [PER Juan Quintana  ] originally laid out the charges in August and officials have drummed them up periodically since ) , [ORG Morales'  ] call for [MISC Bolivians  ] to help the government " identify these [ORG NGOs  ] " ostensibly working to undermine his administration is a troubling development . 
Using [ORG Morales'  ] example of the [LOC Potosi  ] group that was " denied " $20,000 , any person or organization that asks for [ORG USAID  ] funding and does not receive it could allege a political motive . 
We will continue to counter misunderstandings about [ORG USAID  ] 's transparency and apolitical nature with reality . 
However , the [MISC Bolivian  ] government is unlikely to back off from its [ORG USAID  ] assault any time soon , as it enjoys the propaganda value of creating an external enemy to distract from domestic problems . 
Likewise , although government officials have privately admitted to us they do not believe the [LOC U.S.  ] was involved in the police " spying " scandal , they are not disengaging from insinuations of [LOC U.S.  ] involvement . 
[PER Rada  ] 's accusations are designed not to lead to a formal process that would prove or disprove them , but rather to create the appearance of [LOC U.S.  ] impropriety to distract the [MISC Bolivian  ] public from very real and potentially damaging charges against him . 
As such , they are a success . 
The incongruity of the government accusing us of being in cahoots with the opposition and , at the same time , spying on them seems largely overlooked in the public discourse . 
Unfortunately , the [MISC Bolivian  ] press does not consistently apply critical analysis to these incoherent , vague , and sometimes contradictory charges before distributing them to the [MISC Bolivian  ] and international public. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Comment Continued . 
Although they may not always believe in the merits of some of their specific accusations , government leaders from Evo down appear to genuinely believe the [MISC Embassy  ] is working to undermine the [PER Morales  ] administration . 
Given his proclivity to view the [MISC Embassy  ] as separate from the [LOC U.S.  ] government and people , we expect [PER Morales  ] to bring the [ORG GOB  ] 's vague litany of accusations against the [MISC Embassy  ] to both the visiting [ORG Congressional  ] delegation and to the [LOC U.S.  ] public during his planned February 25-27 speaking tour in the [LOC U.S.  ] End Comment .
