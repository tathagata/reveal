( C ) [ORG SUMMARY: Spanish Political  ] Director [PER Rafael Dezcallar  ] and Director General for [LOC North America  ] and [ORG Europe Pepe Pons  ] told [ORG DCM  ] separately that [LOC Spain  ] would oppose any [ORG EU  ] consensus statement on [LOC Kosovo  ] recognition in [LOC Brussels  ] February 18 . 
Separately , [MISC Spanish  ] Deputy DG for ESDP [PER Carlos Fernandez-Arias  ] told [PER Poloff  ] that the maximum statement [LOC Spain  ] could entertain would be a " two-sentence " statement of the outcome from [LOC Pristina  ] and a restatement of the [ORG EU  ] 's commitment to the [MISC Western  ] Balkans . 
The [ORG GAERC  ] also plans to send a message of " no more business as usual " by issuing conclusions on [LOC Burma  ] , [LOC Kenya  ] , and [LOC Chad  ] . 
END SUMMARY. //KOSOVO AND SERBIA// <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On February 13 , [ORG Spanish Political  ] Director [PER Rafael Dezcallar  ] told the [ORG DCM  ] that [LOC Spain  ] would almost certainly not be able to join consensus on [LOC Kosovo  ] recognition at the [ORG GAERC  ] in [LOC Brussels  ] ( ref B ) , but that the decision would be made by [ORG Moncloa  ] . 
[MISC Spanish  ] Vice President [PER Fernandez De La Vega  ] , speaking at the [ORG GOS  ] weekly press briefing February 15 , said , " [LOC Spain  ] does not support a unilateral declaration of independence...Despite the fact that recognition is an exclusively national competency...the government is working and will continue working until the last moment so that the [ORG EU  ] will have a common and active position toward the future of Kosovo...Our position has not changed . 
" Director General for [LOC North America  ] and [ORG Europe Pepe Pons  ] told [ORG DCM  ] February 15 that [LOC Spain  ] would oppose any movement toward [ORG EU  ] recognition at the [ORG GAERC  ] . 
Noting [MISC European  ] concerns about [MISC Spanish  ] opposition due to the elections ( ref C ) , the [ORG DCM  ] emphasized that no one seriously believed that [LOC Kosovo  ] would be an electoral issue , nor did any credible politician see any correlation between [LOC Kosovo  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] internal disputes . 
[PER Pons  ] replied that [LOC Kosovo  ] would be an election issue , saying that [LOC Kosovo  ] is in the headlines and the debate in [LOC Europe  ] is drawing the government 's attention away from its campaign priorities . 
The [ORG DCM  ] countered that there was no guarantee that the [ORG GOS  ] would be in a position to support Kosovar independence after the elections , given that a PSOE victory would mean weeks of negotiations to form a coalition government , while a [ORG PP  ] government would certainly oppose Kosovar independence . 
[PER Pons  ] acknowledged this was true , but said that at least then [LOC Kosovo  ] 's independence would not be distracting the government during the campaign . 
[PER Pons  ] said that the [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador had been to see him earlier on February 15 and had left the impression that the [MISC Russians  ] would react negatively but passively to the [ORG UDI.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Deputy Political Director for ESDP [PER Carlos Fernandez-Arias  ] told [PER Poloff  ] the same separately . 
[PER Fernandez-Arias  ] said that [LOC Spain  ] would not accept any [ORG EU  ] statement that hinted at recognition but would , if pressed , consider a very brief " no more than two sentence " acknowledgment of the outcome in [LOC Pristina  ] on February 17 along with a restatement of the [ORG EU  ] 's commitments in the [MISC Western  ] Balkans . 
[PER Fernandez-Arias  ] noted that the question of recognition is a prerogative of each member nation and is completely separate from [LOC EULEX  ] and the naming of an [ORG EU  ] High Representative , which he said are going forward regardless . 
[PER Fernandez-Arias  ] said that the [ORG EU  ] would not be able to broach the [ORG EU  ] Stabilization and [ORG Association Agreement  ] with the [MISC Serbs  ] again until well after [LOC Kosovo  ] 's independence , once things have calmed down a bit. //MEPP// <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Fernandez-Arias  ] said that there would likely be little discussion of the [LOC Middle East  ] , but that [LOC Spain  ] is concerned about finding a way to keep the [LOC Rafah  ] crossing open to provide a pressure release valve for [LOC Gaza  ] . 
He said that last month 's border events had weakened [PER Abbas  ] and the [LOC PA  ] and had shown the need for such a valve . 
The means to administer that border were more challenging , he said , given the inability to negotiate with [ORG Hamas.  ] //BURMA// <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) According to [PER Fernandez-Arias  ] , [LOC Spain  ] supports the [ORG EU  ] in [LOC Burma  ] and does not want the situation to return to the status quo ante . 
The [ORG GAERC  ] will issue conclusions on [LOC Burma  ] calling for continued pressure and sanctions but FM [ORG Moratinos  ] feels it is also important to send positive signals to the [MISC Burmese  ] regime. //CHAD// [ORG MADRID  ] 00000174 002.2 OF 002 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) With plans moving forward once more for [ORG EUFOR  ] 's deployment to [LOC Chad  ] and [LOC CAR  ] , [LOC Spain  ] is pushing conclusions that will first and foremost keep forward momentum for [ORG EUFOR  ] and also make a qualified statement of support for President Deby that cannot be interpreted as a carte blanche for the [MISC Chadian  ] government to exact reprisals. //KENYA// 7 , ( C ) The [ORG GAERC  ] will issue conclusions on [LOC Kenya  ] calling for dialogue and supporting the [ORG UN  ] , and calling for an end to " business as usual .
