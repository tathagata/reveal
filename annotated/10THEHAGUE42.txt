07 THE HAGUE 2012 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Levin  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b , d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) SUMMARY: Recent allegations by [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Chavez  ] that [LOC U.S.  ] aircraft operating from [MISC Dutch  ] air fields in the [LOC Caribbean  ] have violated [MISC Venezuelan  ] airspace concern the [MISC Dutch  ] . 
For [MISC Antillean  ] and domestic political reasons , the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] sought assurances that [LOC U.S.  ] use of the [LOC Curacao  ] and [LOC Aruba  ] FOLs ( [ORG Forward Operating Locations  ] ) was limited to counter-narcotics surveillance as spelled out in our [ORG FOL Agreement  ] . 
On January 14 , the Ambassador delivered agreed points ( Ref . 
A ) to Foreign Minister [PER Verhagen  ] , who expressed appreciation for the assurance and warned [PER Chavez  ] could do a lot of harm . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) [ORG Dutch Concerns:  ] At the request of the [ORG MFA  ] , [PER POL/ECON Counselor  ] met with [PER Laurent Stokvis  ] ( [ORG WHA A/S  ] equivalent ) , [PER Marc Werschuur  ] ( [LOC Venezuela  ] desk officer ) and [PER Anton Schellekens  ] ( advisor on [LOC Kingdom Affairs  ] -- Antilles/Aruba specialist ) January 12 to discuss President [PER Chavez  ] , s recent assertions of [MISC American  ] aircraft in [MISC Venezuelan  ] airspace . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] believe [PER Chavez  ] wants the [MISC FOLs  ] shut down , and think two important events are driving [PER Chavez  ] , s actions -- the renewal of the [ORG FOL  ] agreement ( the [MISC Dutch  ] believe the agreement is renewed automatically unless a party objects a year before the renewal date -- objection would need to be made by November 2010 ) , and the upcoming [MISC Antillean  ] elections . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] believe [PER Chavez  ] is seeking to shut the [MISC FOLs  ] down by stirring parliamentary objection to renewal of the agreement or promoting the election of an [MISC Antillean  ] coalition opposed to the [LOC FOL.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) Due to the publicity surrounding [PER Chavez  ] , s allegations , Parliament has already sent to the [ORG MFA  ] several sets of questions concerning the [MISC FOLs  ] ) what are they for ? 
What is the [MISC American  ] military doing at the [MISC FOLs  ] ? 
Is the [LOC U.S.  ] using the [MISC FOLs  ] to spy on [LOC Venezuela  ] ? 
Looking at the upcoming [MISC Antillean  ] election , [PER Stokvis  ] noted the opposition party ( supported by [LOC Venezuela  ] ) which opposes [ORG FOL  ] operations is running at 7 seats in the most recent polls . 
The government party has 5 and a pro-independence party has 3 . 
The other two small parties in the ruling coalition register 0 seats . 
If the opposition and pro-independence parties keep this level of support and join in a coalition , renewal of the [ORG FOL  ] agreement could be placed in jeopardy. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) [PER Stokvis  ] stressed it was the firm intention of the [LOC Netherlands  ] to continue the [ORG FOL  ] agreement , but things need to go smoothly . 
The [ORG MFA  ] , therefore , was looking for a way to strengthen the government , s position ( and that of the current governing coalition in the [LOC Antilles  ] ) . 
In the upcoming parliamentary debate , the [ORG MFA  ] will be asked have you asked the [LOC U.S.  ] if the [ORG FOL  ] is only being used for counternarcotics purposes as authorized by the [ORG FOL  ] agreement ? 
To be able to answer that question , the [ORG MFA  ] had suggested a letter from the [LOC U.S.  ] Ambassador to the Foreign Minister ( Reftel B ) . 
Subsequently , [LOC Washington  ] , Post and the [ORG MFA  ] agreed oral assurances would be sufficient. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) During a January 14 meeting with Foreign Minister [PER Verhagen  ] , Ambassador [PER Levin  ] said: - There have been recent allegations of [LOC US  ] aircraft , from [PER Antillean/Aruban FOLs  ] , violating [MISC Venezuelan  ] airspace . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] has categorically denied these allegations. - I understand these allegations have prompted parliamentary inquiry into operations at the [LOC FOLs.  ] - Please let me assure you , Mr. Minister , all operations being conducted at/through the [PER FOLs  ] are in compliance with the [ORG FOL  ] agreement . 
[PER Verhagen  ] responded with appreciation for the assurance . 
[PER Verhagen  ] observed the [MISC Dutch  ] are rather concerned about [PER Chavez  ] . 
It appears [PER Chavez  ] is looking for a pretext for a quarrel . 
He added that [PER Chavez  ] can do a lot of harm . 
For example , he might make economic cooperation with the [LOC Netherlands Antilles  ] difficult by blocking transportation . 
Noting [PER Chavez  ] , s recent statements ( including those in [LOC Copenhagen  ] ) , as well as the [MISC Venezuelan  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] , s calling in the [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC GONL  ] ambassadors in [LOC Caracas  ] on January 11 , [PER Verhagen  ] concluded there is something else.... <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) During a January 21 meeting with the [ORG DCM  ] , [PER Stokvis  ] clarified the [ORG MFA  ] , s concerns . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] do not believe [LOC Venezuela  ] will invade [LOC Curacao  ] , but the [MISC Venezuelans  ] can cause considerable problems , particularly to the [MISC Antillean  ] economy . 
[PER Stokvis  ] noted there were many family ties between the islands and [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
Finally , commenting on [PER Chavez  ] 's recent nationalization of a [MISC French  ] supermarket , [PER Stokvis  ] said a [MISC Dutch  ] grocery chain also had an outlet in the country. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) COMMENT: The [MISC Dutch  ] appreciate the [LOC U.S.  ] willingness to provide oral assurances about the [ORG FOL  ] operations . 
They are also looking for some way to dampen down [PER Chavez  ] , s rhetoric , but they haven , t yet found the right mechanism . 
With upcoming [MISC Antillean  ] elections and the pending change in constitutional status of the islands , the [MISC Dutch  ] remained worried about [PER Chavez  ] , s troublemaking . 
END COMMENT .
