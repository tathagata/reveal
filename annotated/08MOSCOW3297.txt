End Summary. ------------------------ [PER KHAN  ] AND [ORG AAR  ] TAKING OVER ------------------------ 2 . 
( C ) [ORG TNK-BP  ] Vice President for [ORG International Affairs Shawn McCormick  ] told us November 7 that [ORG AAR  ] 's months-long campaign to wrest operational control of the company from [ORG BP  ] were close to fruition . 
The [MISC Russian  ] shareholders , in the person of Executive Director and [ORG Alfa  ] partner [MISC German  ] [PER Khan  ] , have moved quickly and aggressively to exert maximum control over the company 's operations following their October agreement with [ORG BP  ] that " ended " the shareholder dispute . 
3 . 
( C ) [PER McCormick  ] confirmed press rumors that former [ORG Norilsk Nickel  ] head [PER Denis Morozov  ] has been chosen to replace CEO [PER Robert Dudley  ] , but stressed that the selection is " irrelevant . 
" [PER McCormick  ] maintained that the job description of the new CEO could be summarized as " do what [PER Khan  ] says , " as [PER Khan  ] has , in effect , rendered the CEO just a " titular position . 
" 4 . 
( C ) According to [PER McCormick  ] , [MISC Russian  ] shareholders [PER Mikhail Fridman  ] ( [PER Khan  ] 's [ORG Alfa  ] partner ) and [PER Len Blavatnik  ] ( Amcit ) , are not interested in managing the company and are willing to leave it to [PER Khan  ] . 
According to [PER McCormick  ] , [PER Viktor Vekselberg  ] , the final [ORG AAR  ] partner , is interested to some degree in the gas side of the business , but is also backing [PER Khan  ] 's effort to gain operational control of the company. -------------------- [ORG BP  ] and the [ORG Barn Door  ] -------------------- 5 . 
( C ) [PER McCormick  ] noted that [ORG BP  ] has assigned an experienced [MISC Russia-hand  ] , [PER David Peattie  ] , as the new Group Vice President overseeing [ORG BP  ] 's interests in [ORG TNK-BP  ] . 
[PER Peattie  ] intends to be in [LOC Moscow  ] more often and to be more active in looking after [ORG BP  ] 's interest in the company than his predecessor . 
He also plans to make changes to the personnel in [ORG BP Russia  ] and to involve it in [ORG TNK-BP  ] 's management , a departure from its past hands-off approach . 
6 . 
( C ) However , [PER McCormick  ] said while these changes might have made a difference six months ago , they are too little too late to have an effect now . 
" [ORG BP  ] had already given up " in September when it agreed to removing [PER Dudley  ] and renegotiating the original shareholder agreement ( reftel ) . 
The outlook for the company was now poor and [PER McCormick  ] told us that most of the remaining foreign staff , including himself , [PER COO Tim Summers  ] , and other senior management is leaving the company . 
[PER McCormick  ] said his last day would be in mid-December . 
By January 1 , there would be only 25 or so foreign employees left in the company ( down from 130 plus another 150 [ORG BP  ] secondees before the dispute ) , of whom only 4 would have any ties to [ORG BP  ] and none would be a position of authority . 
7 . 
( C ) [PER McCormick  ] said the drive to reduce the foreign presence in [ORG TNK-BP  ] was driven partly by the desire for control and partly to cut costs . 
With oil prices collapsing while production costs and taxes remained high , [ORG TNK-BP  ] was now losing $5 on every barrel of oil that it exported . 
The [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00003297 002 OF 002 company had cut exports by 100,000 barrels but [PER Khan  ] had sought to eliminate whole sections of the company to reduce losses further . 
[PER McCormick  ] said [PER Khan  ] had now realized he had gone too far and that he could not run the company effectively without foreign expertise , but was having little or no luck in convincing employees to stay or in recruiting foreign replacements. -------------------- GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER ? -------------------- 8 . 
( C ) [PER McCormick  ] said [PER Khan  ] 's control of the company might prove short-lived . 
Well-placed contacts of his inside the [MISC Russian  ] government had told him earlier in the week that the [ORG GOR  ] 's plan is to split [ORG TNK-BP  ] into separate oil and gas companies in 2009 . 
According to these contacts , the oil company would then be taken over by state-owned [ORG Rosneft  ] and the gas company would be taken over by state-owned [ORG Gazprom  ] . 
The contacts initially told him that [ORG BP  ] would also be out , but in a subsequent meeting on November 10 , told him that it might be allowed to stay on as a minority shareholder in one or both of the companies . 
[PER McCormick  ] added that [ORG TNK-BP  ] was already on its way to becoming a " parastatal " as several of its new executives were joining the company from the ranks of the government. ------- COMMENT ------- 9 . 
( C ) xxxxxxxxxxxx However , if [PER McCormick  ] 's sources are right , [PER Khan  ] and his partners will in turn be hoisted on their own petard as [ORG Rosneft  ] and [ORG Gazprom  ] divide up the company , dictate settlement terms to [ORG AAR  ] , and in the process perhaps inadvertently save [ORG BP  ] 's investment , albeit with no control over the companies or their assets .
