Stapleton  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: Former prime minister [PER Michel Rocard  ] received Ambassador [PER Stapleton October  ] 24 . 
Fresh off the early-October publication of his new book , " If the Left Had Known , " and a recent trip to [LOC China  ] , [PER Rocard  ] sees the November congress of his [ORG Socialist Party  ] ( [ORG PS  ] ) as a historic opportunity . 
Offering a historical perspective , [PER Rocard  ] stated that the [ORG PS  ] , unlike its main counterparts in [LOC Europe  ] , has never cut itself off completely with the ideology and politics of " rupture with capitalism . 
" When in power , dealing with the world as it is , the [ORG PS  ] has been forced to modernize . 
This was particularly true during the five years ( 1997-2002 ) [PER Lionel Jospin  ] led the party and government . 
When out of power , it is pulled back by the romanticism of its [MISC Marxist  ] roots . 
[PER Rocard  ] described his historic role in the party as that of the leader of the modernizers -- in the tradition of [PER Jean Jaures  ] , [PER Leon Blum  ] and [PER Pierre Mendes-France  ] . 
He was hopeful that at the [LOC Le Mans Congress  ] in November , the [MISC Socialists  ] would make the final break from the past and emerge as a unified [ORG Social Democratic Party  ] . 
[PER Rocard  ] was reluctant to pronounce on the Socialists' stable of presidential contenders , but was skeptical that [PER Jospin  ] would emerge to rally the party to victory ; too many can not forgive him for having deserted the ship when he abruptly announced his retirement the morning after his defeat in the first round of the 2002 Presidential elections . 
[PER Rocard  ] expressed the fear and loathing of [PER Nicolas Sarkozy  ] that is common currency on the left . 
[PER Dominique de Villepin  ] is a more acceptable alternative on the right -- even if he mistakes himself for [PER Napoleon  ] when he is in fact [PER Cyrano de Bergerac  ] . 
[PER Rocard  ] , who did not support the war in [LOC Iraq  ] , said that if he had been President , he would have privately explained his views to President [PER Bush  ] , but then would have remained with the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Rocard  ] , long chastised by some as " the [MISC American  ] in the party , " pronounced anti-Americanism a minority sentiment historically linked to the [MISC Communists  ] and [MISC Gaullists  ] . 
He advocated a joint effort , in the form of a [MISC European/American  ] think-tank , to identify and address common , emerging challenges . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Rocard  ] , like former president [PER Valery Giscard  ] d'Estaing ( reftel ) , believes that [MISC French  ] history provides the keys for understanding [MISC French  ] politics and [LOC France  ] 's policies . 
[PER Rocard  ] 's point of departure is [LOC France  ] 's emergence as a nation-state . 
The history of other [MISC European  ] nation-states is that of linguistic communities serving their trade needs . 
[LOC France  ] created itself by destroying five cultures -- Breton , [LOC Occitan  ] , [LOC Alsatian  ] , [LOC Corsican  ] , and [MISC Flemish  ] . 
" We are the only [MISC European  ] nation which is the military creation of a non-homogeneous State . 
This makes [LOC France  ] difficult to govern to this day . 
This explains our difficulty in reforming , our slowness , " he said. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [ORG Socialist Party  ] -- and its historic resistance to embrace [MISC Social Democracy  ] -- is a case in point . 
[PER Rocard  ] contrasted the [ORG PS  ] with [MISC European  ] counterpart parties , noting that in most countries , a [ORG Social Democratic  ] party can expect about 35 to 42 percent of the national vote . 
In [LOC France  ] , however , the [ORG PS  ] can only count on about 18 to 22 percent , with the [MISC Communists  ] taking about 7 to 8 percent , and parties of the extreme left a roughly equal number . 
The need to work with the [MISC Communists  ] , the far left -- and the unformed wing of the [ORG PS  ] , makes it difficult to have " feasible , realistic " economic policies . 
[PER Rocard  ] pointed out that in the 25 [ORG EU  ] member states , only the [ORG PS  ] , among the main parties of the [MISC European  ] left , had split ( and a majority of its electorate opposed ) over the proposed [ORG Constitutional Treaty.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Rocard  ] stressed the importance of the upcoming November party congress . 
The [MISC French  ] media insist on focusing on it only as it pertains to the fortunes of the would-be Presidential candidates . 
While the [ORG Congress  ] will have an impact on individual candidacies , its significance will depend on its success in defining the program , even the identity of the party -- amidst debate and soul-searching stirred up by the referendum . 
[PER Rocard  ] listed three important questions for the party to resolve: Are we [MISC Social Democrats  ] ? 
Are we [MISC Europeans  ] ? 
Do we admit at last that the market economy is not only a reality , but a necessity ? 
While he thought it possible ( and in his view essential ) that the [ORG Congress  ] will answer each question in the affirmative , this is not a foregone conclusion . 
The party leadership had taken the right approach in deciding to address the policy issues before proceeding to the selection of a candidate . 
It has created an opportunity for the [ORG Socialist Party  ] to finally emerge as a modern [ORG Social Democratic Party  ] comparable to the [ORG SPD  ] in [LOC Germany  ] or Labor in [LOC Britain  ] . 
Such a " clarifying result " would represent the break from the past that [PER Rocard  ] has long sought . 
That said , a more tepid result was possible given the strength of the traditionalists , including those now centered around [PER Laurent Fabius.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Rocard  ] clearly did not wish to be drawn out on the merits or demerits of the possible Socialist candidates for the Presidency in 2007 . 
Replying to the Ambassador 's question on how the [ORG PS  ] could transcend its normal 18-to-22-percent electoral take ( in the first round of Presidential elections ) and furnish a winning presidential candidate , [PER Rocard  ] cited the need for a charismatic candidate and an attractive platform . 
This winning combination would produce a sufficiently strong showing in the first round so as to obviate the need to negotiate with the [MISC Communists  ] and far left -- thereby increasing its appeal to the moderate center in the second round. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Noting a media effort by allies of [PER Lionel Jospin  ] to position the former Prime Minister as the only figure who could rally the fissiporous left , [PER Rocard  ] was skeptical . 
[PER Rocard  ] , in a fair-minded assessment of [PER Jospin  ] , cited his historic contribution of opening up the party in the post-Mitterrand period , a modernization that was cut short by the defeat in 2002 . 
He cited [PER Jospin  ] 's honesty , but saw it as a political liability: " [PER Jospin  ] can't bear lying . 
He is a straight and honest man -- to the point of rigidity . 
He refuses to make unfillable promises to the electorate . 
" Despite [PER Jospin  ] 's virtues , his abrupt departure after his defeat in the first round of the 2002 elections was viewed by too many in the party and among its supporters as an act of desertion in the hour of the party 's -- and country 's -- greatest need . 
This would likely disqualify him for another run at the [LOC Presidency.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Rocard  ] was more voluble when discussing the two Presidential rivals on the right . 
He compared Prime Minister [PER Villepin  ] favorably to Interior Minister and Union for a [ORG Popular Movement  ] ( [ORG UMP  ] ) President [PER Nicolas Sarkozy  ] . 
Even if [PER Villepin  ] had gained notice by his 2003 speech before the [ORG UN Security Council  ] , not a pleasant association for the [LOC U.S.  ] it is [PER Sarkozy  ] whom we should fear . 
[PER Villepin  ] " knows the limits of power . 
" [PER Sarkozy  ] , by contrast , has traveled little , has minimal foreign language ability , and only a meager interest in international issues . 
He employs a language when addressing illegal immigrants that [PER Rocard  ] characterized as 'borderline racist . 
" In short , " [PER Sarkozy  ] is not safe in his respect for human rights . 
He 's not [PER Le Pen  ] , but he 's a danger to the balance of the [LOC French Republic  ] in its practice of human rights . 
" By contrast , [PER Villepin  ] shares our common values concerning human right . 
In addition , " he is someone who would never mistake those who are allies with those who are not " ( sic ) . <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Rocard  ] , however , also expressed his " anger " at [PER Villepin  ] for the 2003 [MISC UNSC  ] speech , which he thought had been counter-productive , particularly with respect to then-Secretary [PER Powell  ] . 
" We should have been supporting [PER Powell  ] ; instead , [PER Villepin  ] pushed him into a corner . 
" [PER Rocard  ] said that if he had been President of [LOC France  ] at the time , he would have written a four or five page letter to President [PER Bush  ] at the outset , setting forth his misgivings over a military solution . 
The letter would have remained confidential . 
Once the [LOC U.S.  ] decided to proceed against [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC SIPDIS  ] however , he would have remained silent , and not led international opposition as [ORG Chirac  ] and [PER Villepin  ] had done . 
[PER Rocard  ] joked that [PER Villepin  ] identifies with [PER Napoleon  ] , whereas he is in fact more a [PER Cyrano de Bergerac  ] character . 
He is the inheritor of a proud [MISC French  ] oral tradition: " We like to talk ; if you want a silent partner , you should be dealing with the [MISC Finns  ] instead . 
" <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Rocard  ] emphasized to the Ambassador the importance of not conflating the loud [MISC French  ] anti-Americanism espoused by the [MISC Communists  ] and Gaullists with the pro-American sentiment felt by most [MISC French  ] people . 
" Please don't forget , " he said , " that anti-Americanism has never won a majority here . 
" He criticized the [LOC U.S.  ] , however , for not having listened to " friendly " advice in the lead-up to the [LOC Iraq  ] war . 
The [MISC French  ] , who lost two colonial wars , in [LOC Indochina  ] and [LOC Algeria  ] , he said , tried to warn the [LOC U.S.  ] that it would be unavoidable -- " sociologically predictable " -- that the [MISC Iraqi  ] factions would unite against the [ORG USG  ] . 
He emphasized , however , the necessity for the [LOC U.S.  ] to stay the course , warning that [LOC Iraq  ] would descend into civil war if the [LOC U.S.  ] left before 2010-2012. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) In response to the Ambassador 's question on the consequences for [LOC Europe  ] of the failure of the constitutional treaty , [PER Rocard  ] said he thought it " less important than many believe , and not too important to the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" There is indeed a resultant paralysis , but not of the functioning of the [ORG EU  ] . 
Rather , it has incapacitated the creative energy and enthusiasm for the [MISC European  ] project . 
" It kills the idea of a political [LOC Europe  ] which you ( the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) were afraid of , and does not change a thing in the integrated market . 
" He provided his assessment that the current Administration 's support for [LOC Europe  ] had been hesitant , and for two reasons: concern over the possible emergence of [LOC Europe  ] as a military power separate from NATO/US ; and , increasing conflict over economic and commercial issues , which was an unavoidable result of [LOC Europe  ] 's development as strong , unitary player in the international economy. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Rocard  ] proposed a joint [MISC European/American  ] think-tank , which might fill a current gap -- a place where [MISC Europeans  ] and [MISC Americans  ] can together consider the challenges of tomorrow . 
Speaking of the growth of [LOC India  ] and [LOC China  ] , along with all the other challenges confronting both of us , he said , " We need a vehicle where we can find solutions for these challenges together -- so when these monsters arrive in 10 years , we will be able to deal with them .
