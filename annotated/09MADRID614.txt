NAPOLITANO'S JULY 1 MEETINGS IN [LOC MADRID  ] MADRID 00000614 001.2 OF 004 Classified By: Charge [PER D'Affaires Arnold A. Chacon  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) a nd ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C//NF ) Madam Secretary , Embassy [LOC Madrid  ] warmly welcomes your visit , which comes on the heels of your June 24 meeting with [MISC Spanish  ] Interior Minister [PER Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba  ] in [LOC Washington  ] ( Ref A ) . 
While one of the highlights of his trip was signing the bilateral accord on Preventing and [MISC Combating Serious Crime  ] , one of the centerpieces of your [LOC Madrid  ] trip will be to sign an MOU to formalize the [ORG DHS Immigration Advisory Program  ] ( [ORG IAP  ] ) at [LOC Madrid  ] 's [LOC Barajas Airport  ] and a declaration of intent for our two governments to work toward concluding an agreement on Cooperation in [ORG Science & Technology  ] for [ORG Homeland Security Matters  ] . 
You will hold meetings with President [PER Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero  ] , his Second Vice President , [PER Elena Salgado  ] , who also serves as Minister of Economy and Finance , and Interior Minister [PER Rubalcaba  ] . 
The Embassy also will co-host a reception in your honor , which will give you and your delegation an opportunity to meet a range of additional senior-level officials in the [MISC Spanish  ] Government . 
Your visit will help to highlight the importance that the [ORG USG  ] places on the overall bilateral relationship and the numerous programs that the DHS is working on with our [MISC Spanish  ] hosts . 
While the focus of your trip will be on discussing bilateral issues , your interlocutors may express [ORG GOS  ] interest in preliminary discussions to increase collaboration on justice and home affairs issues during [LOC Spain  ] 's upcoming stint as President of the [ORG European Union  ] ( [ORG EU  ] ) during the first half of 2010. //US-SPAIN RELATIONS// <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C//NF ) U.S.-Spain relations are strong and based on shared global interests . 
[LOC Spain  ] is a valued [LOC US  ] partner and an important geostrategic player that has achieved a remarkable transformation since the end of the [MISC Franco  ] dictatorship 30 years ago . 
It is one of the leading democracies in [LOC Europe  ] , and has the ninth-largest economy in the world . 
[LOC Spain  ] is an important friend and ally , and we value its cooperation against terrorism and a range of other security issues . 
Since the [LOC U.S.  ] presidential election in November , a strong atmosphere of goodwill has emerged in [LOC Spain  ] for closer bilateral cooperation . 
As a gesture of this goodwill , the [ORG GOS  ] presently is considering accepting some of the detainees currently held at [LOC Guantanamo  ] ( [LOC GTMO  ] , see Ref B ) . 
In [LOC Washington  ] , [PER Rubalcaba  ] publicly stated that [LOC Spain  ] may accept as many as five detainees . 
[LOC Spain  ] is an important [ORG NATO  ] ally , a key player in the [ORG EU  ] , and during January-June 2010 will hold the [ORG EU  ] 's rotating Presidency . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , judicial , and information-sharing efforts , at least with us . 
The [ORG USG  ] and [ORG GOS  ] signed the [ORG Homeland Security Presidential Directive  ] 6 ( [MISC HSPD-6  ] ) information-sharing agreement in 2007 . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
The [MISC DHS/ICE  ] office within Embassy [LOC Madrid  ] has worked with [ORG GOS  ] counterparts over the past year on successful running of the [ORG IAP  ] and in operations targeting bulk-cash smuggling at [LOC Barajas Airport  ] . 
[LOC Spain  ] also is a founding member of the [ORG Proliferation Security Initiative  ] and an active member in the [ORG Global Initiative  ] to [ORG Combat Nuclear Terrorism  ] . 
As per Ref C , [LOC Spain  ] currently is being considered for [LOC MADRID  ] 00000614 002.2 OF 004 membership in the [ORG G-8 Partnership Against  ] the Spread of [LOC Weapons  ] and Materials of [MISC Mass Destruction  ] . 
[LOC Spain  ] also allows us the use of two military bases that are critical transit points between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
One recent irritant in bilateral relationship is are the efforts by some investigating judges - invoking " universal jurisdiction " - to indict former [ORG USG  ] officials for their allegedly involvement in torture at [LOC GTMO  ] ( Ref D ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Your visit to [LOC Madrid  ] and [PER Rubalcaba  ] 's visit to [LOC Washington  ] are but the latest in a series of high-level exchanges , including a presidential bilateral on the margins of the [LOC U.S.-EU Summit  ] in [LOC Prague  ] in April , a meeting between [ORG National Security Adviser  ] Gen. [PER Jones  ] and King [PER Juan Carlos  ] I in [LOC Florida  ] in February , and Foreign Minister Moratinos 's February meeting in [LOC Washington  ] with Secretary [PER Clinton  ] . 
At the end of May , [LOC U.S.  ] Transportation Secretary [PER LaHood  ] became the first cabinet-level visitor to [LOC Spain  ] on behalf of the [ORG Obama Administration  ] . 
While you are in [LOC Madrid  ] , Defense Minister [PER Carme Chacon  ] will be in [LOC Washington  ] during June 30 - July 2 for discussions with Secretary [PER Gates  ] , among other meetings ( Ref E ) . //THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT// <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In office since 2004 , [PER Zapatero  ] won reelection to a second term in March 2008 , but his center-left [MISC Spanish  ] Socialist [ORG Workers Party  ] ( [ORG PSOE  ] ) is seven seats shy of a majority in the 350-seat [ORG Congress  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
Unemployment is over 17% , the highest rate in the [ORG EU  ] , and it is expected to reach 20% sometime in the next year . 
Although popularity ratings for [PER Zapatero  ] and the Socialists are low , the conservative opposition [ORG Popular Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) has struggled to capitalize on this . 
The [ORG PP  ] , hampered by internal divisions , also has been dogged by corruption accusations . 
Nevertheless , [PER Zapatero  ] suffered his first serious political reverse since winning reelection when his party lost power in March 2009 regional elections in [LOC Galicia  ] . 
[PER Zapatero  ] shuffled the cabinet April 7 as a response to criticism of the GOS' inability to resolve the economic crisis and with an eye to the June [ORG European Parliament  ] elections . 
The most prominent change was the replacement of the Second Vice President/Minister of Economy and Finance . 
Even so , the [ORG PP  ] secured more seats than the Socialists in the June 7 [ORG European Parliament  ] elections , another sign that [PER Zapatero  ] needs to focus on the economic situation. //YOUR MEETINGS// <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
He may even take credit , as in the case of adjustments in [LOC U.S.-Cuba  ] policy , for shaping [ORG USG  ] views . 
He is not innately ill-disposed to the [ORG USG  ] . 
For him , foreign policy is subordinate to domestic political interests , and the [LOC U.S.  ] relationship is just one more element to be viewed [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
[LOC MADRID  ] 00000614 003.2 OF 004 currently a wave of goodwill for President [PER Obama  ] in [LOC Spain  ] , which is the answer to [PER Zapatero  ] 's prayers in that it enables him to engage the [ORG USG  ] without being dinged by the traditional anti-U.S. sentiment among his socialist base . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
[PER Zapatero  ] does not speak [MISC English  ] , though we think he may understand it. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) You will recall Interior Minister [PER Rubalcaba  ] - who has wide-ranging responsibilities on security , law enforcement and intelligence issues - as very capable and serious but also charming . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
He is known for his intelligence , discretion , hard work , and mastery of detail , as well as his negotiating prowess . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
You and Minister [PER Rubalcaba  ] are scheduled to sign an [ORG MOU  ] formalizing ongoing cooperation on the DHS 's [ORG Immigration Advisory Program  ] ( [ORG IAP  ] ) at [LOC Madrid  ] 's [LOC Barajas Airport  ] , where a successful pilot program recently was carried out . 
You are also scheduled to sign a declaration of intent for our two governments to work toward concluding an agreement on Cooperation in [ORG Science & Technology  ] for [ORG Homeland Security Matters  ] . 
[PER Rubalcaba  ] also is likely to continue his [LOC Washington  ] discussions with you on the [MISC US-EU  ] transatlantic agenda , border control issues , [LOC CSI  ] , document falsification , money laundering , and an alert system in case of the theft of arms or explosives for terrorist purposes . 
He may discuss further his recent proposal for an exchange of liaison personnel to have officials present in each others' headquarters . 
In addition to the preceding topics , you may also wish to raise trafficking in persons , illegal immigration , [ORG Frontex  ] issues , and [ORG Special Interest Alien Smuggling  ] through [LOC Madrid-Barajas Airport  ] en route to the [LOC United States  ] . 
[PER Rubalcaba  ] speaks [MISC English  ] but prefers to have an interpreter present during discussions of some technical aspects of his portfolio. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
[PER Elena Salgado  ] is the Second Vice President and Minister of Economy and Finance . 
She was moved up from being Minister of [ORG Public Administration  ] in April , as part of the broader cabinet shuffle intended to highlight an intensified [ORG GOS  ] effort to combat the impact of the global economic crisis on [LOC Spain  ] . 
[PER Rubalcaba  ] reportedly was an influential figure in supporting her appointment . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
She previously served as Minister of [ORG Public Administration  ] ( 2007-09 ) and Minister of Health ( 2004-07 ) . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] Government in 2006 unsuccessfully nominated [PER Salgado  ] as a candidate for the Presidency of the [ORG World Health Organization  ] . 
[PER Salgado  ] also has extensive private sector experience in consulting and telecommunications industries . 
[PER Salgado  ] , born in 1949 , has degrees in industrial engineering and economics . 
[PER Salgado  ] would be an appropriate [ORG GOS  ] official with whom to discuss [LOC CSI  ] , money laundering and bulk-cash smuggling , and the [ORG USG  ] 's [LOC MADRID  ] 00000614 004.2 OF 004 relationship with [MISC Spanish Customs  ] . 
[PER Salgado  ] speaks [MISC English  ] .
