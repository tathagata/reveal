<code><pre>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 05 [LOC DUSHANBE  ] 000173 SIPDIS STATE DEPARTMENT FOR S/RAP EO 12958 DECL: 2/16/2020 TAGS PREL , PGOV , PHUM , EAID , [LOC ECON  ] , [LOC EINV  ] , [ORG TI SUBJECT: CORRECTED COPY  ] - [LOC TAJIKISTAN  ] SCENESETTER FOR VISIT OF SRAP HOLBROOKE CLASSIFIED BY: NECIA QUAST , [ORG CDA  ] , [ORG EXEC  ] , DOS . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: [LOC U.S.  ] interests in [LOC Tajikistan  ] are a stable state on Afghanistan’s northern border , support for our military efforts in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and for [LOC Tajikistan  ] to be a stabilizing influence and contributor to economic development in the region . 
[LOC Tajikistan  ] gives unrestricted over flight rights , and quickly agreed to [LOC NDN  ] ground transit . 
In the medium term , it could play a more active role in regional development , because of its huge hydropower potential , relative ( to [LOC Afghanistan  ] ) stability , and religiously moderate population . 
But to do so [LOC Tajikistan  ] must overcome multiple political and economic problems which stymie its own development: poverty , bad relations with [LOC Uzbekistan  ] , intense corruption , [MISC Soviet-era  ] economic structures and planning , an undemocratic political system , chronic food insecurity , and dependence on migrant labor in [LOC Russia.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [LOC U.S.  ] assistance has shown mixed results in the development sphere . 
Recent steps to improve the business climate have been offset by the government’s campaign to force its citizens to contribute to the construction of the [ORG Roghun  ] hydroelectric dam . 
The government is not willing to reform its political process . 
Our security cooperation shows some promise . 
Regardless of our efforts , there is a limit to what [LOC Tajikistan  ] can offer: it produces very little , is poor , and its government has minimal capacity . 
The [PER Tajiks  ] have some unrealistic ideas about what we can offer them -- mainly large infrastructure projects including questionable power plants , tunnels to [LOC Pakistan  ] , and bridges to nowhere . 
There is some truth to the quip that [MISC Tajikistan’s  ] real contribution to our efforts in [LOC Afghanistan  ] is to be stable , and to allow unfettered over flight and transit to our forces - which the [PER Tajiks  ] have done unfailingly . 
We try to promote [MISC Tajik  ] polices which will ensure continued stability . 
End summary . 
A DIFFICULT NEIGHBORHOOD <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Some of [MISC Tajikistan’s  ] difficulties are geographic . 
Chronic problems with [LOC Uzbekistan  ] , fueled by personal animosity between the presidents of each country , has stymied [MISC Tajikistan’s  ] trade , energy self-sufficiency , and economic development . 
[MISC Afghan  ] instability is a malign influence: traffic in drugs undermines rule of law in [LOC Tajikistan  ] , [PER Tajiks  ] fear the spread of extremist ideas from [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and militants in [LOC Afghanistan  ] can threaten [MISC Tajik  ] security across the long , porous border . 
[MISC Russian  ] interference looms large in the [MISC Tajik  ] consciousness . 
The [MISC Russians  ] control one major hydropower dam in [LOC Tajikistan  ] , a source of disagreements between the two countries . 
The [PER Tajiks  ] seek alternative partners , including the [LOC United States  ] , [LOC China  ] , and [LOC Iran  ] , to balance [MISC Russian  ] influence . 
[LOC China  ] is a major infrastructure donor , with over $1 billion in low-interest loans to [LOC Tajikistan  ] to build roads and power line projects . 
[LOC Iran  ] funds tunnel and hydropower projects , but displays of [MISC Persian  ] solidarity do not mask deep suspicions between the hard-drinking , Soviet-reared , [MISC Sunni  ] elite in [LOC Dushanbe  ] and religiously conservative [MISC Shiites  ] in [LOC Tehran.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [MISC Tajik  ] government presses us for greater benefits in return for support on [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The [PER Tajiks  ] think [LOC Uzbekistan  ] is keeping all NDN-related business for itself ; they want more traffic to transit [LOC Tajikistan  ] , more infrastructure to support that traffic , and the [LOC United States  ] to purchase [MISC Tajik  ] goods for forces in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
We currently purchase small amounts of [MISC Tajik  ] bottled water for [ORG ISAF  ] . 
They have indicated they would be happy for the [LOC U.S.  ] establish an air base in [LOC Tajikistan  ] . 
They see [LOC U.S.  ] involvement in the region as a bulwark against [MISC Afghan  ] instability , and as a cash cow they want a piece of . 
FEAR OF INTERNAL RIVALS , MILITANTS , AND [LOC RUSSIA  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [MISC Tajik  ] civil war ended in 1997 with a power sharing arrangement between President Rahmon’s government and the leaders of the [MISC United Tajik  ] Opposition ( [ORG UTO  ] ) . 
Since the end of [LOC DUSHANBE  ] 00000173 002 OF 005 the war , [PER Rahmon  ] gradually has reneged on this deal and forced nearly all oppositionists out of government -- some are in prison , some left the country , and others died mysteriously . 
In May 2009 an armed group led by a former [ORG UTO  ] figure , [PER Mullah Abdullo Rahimov  ] , returned to [LOC Tajikistan  ] from [LOC Afghanistan  ] , reportedly with several foreign fighters . 
[MISC Tajik  ] security forces neutralized this group without outside assistance . 
They have told us [LOC U.S.  ] training enabled their security forces to win , and they are eager for more training. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [MISC Russian-Tajik  ] relations have deteriorated . 
[MISC Tajik  ] officials believe the [MISC Russians  ] supported [PER Mullah Abdullo’s  ] group , to signal [LOC Tajikistan  ] that they need [MISC Russian  ] protection . 
The two governments could not agree on the terms of [MISC Russian  ] involvement in the [ORG Roghun Dam  ] , and they have other differences . 
In October 2009 the President downgraded the formal status of the [MISC Russian  ] language in [LOC Tajikistan  ] . 
His government broached charging [LOC Russia  ] rent for its military bases in [LOC Tajikistan  ] . 
In 2009 the Russian-controlled [MISC Sangtuda-1  ] hydroelectric plant cut production when the government of [MISC Tajikistan’s  ] failed to pay its bills on time . 
ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [LOC Tajikistan  ] is the poorest of the former [MISC Soviet  ] republics . 
It is more mountainous than [LOC Afghanistan  ] , with earthquakes , floods , droughts , locusts and extreme weather . 
Parts of the country are often cut off by snow and avalanches . 
External links pass through obstructive [LOC Uzbekistan  ] , unstable [LOC Afghanistan  ] , or over the rough , remote Pamir passes to western [LOC China  ] . 
Its only industrial products are aluminum and hydroelectricity . 
The [ORG Tajik Aluminum Company  ] ( [LOC Talco  ] ) accounts for most of [MISC Tajikistan’s  ] exports . 
Though it is technically state-owned , most of its revenues end up in a secretive offshore company controlled by the President , and the state budget sees little of the income . 
[ORG Talco  ] consumes up to half of [MISC Tajikistan’s  ] electricity , contributing to major seasonal shortages and suffering. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) President Rahmon’s response to [MISC Tajikistan’s  ] chronic energy insecurity was in late 2009 to launch a massive campaign to fund and build the [ORG Roghun Hydroelectric Plant  ] . 
[ORG Roghun  ] would be the highest dam in the world , and double [MISC Tajikistan’s  ] electricity generation capacity . 
The government’s fundraising efforts , however , have drawn serious concern from international donors . 
Individuals and organizations across all walks of life have been coerced into buying shares in the project . 
Many people have been told they will lose their jobs unless they contribute an amount equal to many months’ salary . 
While the government claims all share sales are voluntary , there is ample evidence that officials are forcing the population to cough up funds . 
Apart from the human rights question , donors are concerned that the nearly $200 million in funds raised so far will not be accounted for and spent transparently . 
Considering [MISC Talco’s  ] share of electricity consumption , the [ORG Roghun  ] campaign looks like a means to ensure [MISC Talco’s  ] continued profitability. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [MISC Tajikistan’s  ] economy suffers from the global recession through major drops in exports , imports , and remittances from a million [PER Tajiks  ] working in [LOC Russia  ] . 
The money they sent home was equal to over 50% of GDP in 2008 , and literally keeps rural communities alive . 
Remittances dropped 34% in 2009 . 
The greatest obstacle to improving the economy is resistance to reform . 
From the President down to the policeman on the street , government is characterized by cronyism and corruption . 
[PER Rahmon  ] and his family control the country’s major businesses , including the largest bank , and they play hardball to protect their business interests , no matter the cost to the economy writ large . 
As one foreign ambassador summed up , President [PER Rahmon  ] prefers to control 90% of a ten-dollar pie rather than 30% of a hundred-dollar pie . 
[LOC DUSHANBE  ] 00000173 003 OF 005 ELECTIONS ARE COMING , BUT DEMOCRACY ISN’T <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The government has limited opposition party operations and rejected electoral law reforms for the February 28 , 2010 parliamentary elections . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] does not expect the elections to be free and fair . 
There has been almost no coverage of opposition political parties by state media , and most of the population is unaware of the purpose of the elections . 
Parliamentary opposition is weak -- only 15 of the 62 members are not in the ruling party , and some of these are independent in name only . 
The most prominent opposition party , the [ORG Islamic Renewal Party  ] of [LOC Tajikistan  ] ( [ORG IRPT  ] ) , has two seats in the outgoing parliament . 
[ORG IRPT  ] leadership has supported the government on most issues and downplays the importance of [MISC Islam  ] in the party’s platform . 
Parliament acts as a rubber stamp. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In 2009 Parliament passed a restrictive new law on religion , curbing the activities of religious groups , [MISC Islamic  ] or otherwise . 
Our advice that this could radicalize many believers has fallen on deaf ears . 
Last year , the government arrested dozens of individuals , accusing them of membership in the banned “Salafiya” movement , but it has no evidence that there is an organized [LOC Salafiya  ] movement . 
It also arrested 92 members of the [MISC Muslim  ] fundamentalist missionary group , [PER Jamaati Tabligh  ] . 
Most mainstream [MISC Muslim  ] religious leaders view the Tabligh members as harmless missionaries and have called for their release. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Independent media is reeling after government officials recently filed lawsuits against five newspapers for reporting on public government reports and statements in open court which were critical of judges and government ministries . 
The newspapers will be forced to close if the lawsuits succeed . 
We and [MISC European  ] partners have protested the lawsuits . 
DIFFICULT RELATIONS WITH DONORS <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In 2007 [ORG Tajikistan’s National Bank  ] admitted it had hidden a billion dollars in loans and guarantees to politically-connected cotton investors ( of which $600 million was never repaid ) , violating its [ORG IMF  ] program . 
The [ORG IMF  ] demanded early repayment of some debt , an audit of the [ORG National Bank  ] , and other reforms before renewing assistance . 
In May 2009 the [ORG IMF  ] voted to lend a further $116 million to [LOC Tajikistan  ] to help it through the next three years ; the [LOC U.S.  ] was the only [ORG IMF  ] member to vote against this , which infuriated the [MISC Tajik  ] government . 
The [ORG IMF  ] has so far disbursed $40 million . 
A team from [LOC Washington  ] was recently in [LOC Dushanbe  ] to assess government progress , establish new benchmarks for the next tranche of funds , and assess the impact of [ORG Roghun  ] fundraising . 
The team’s assessment should be available soon . 
Donors are concerned that the campaign to finance [ORG Roghun  ] is exacerbating severe poverty , and violates the terms of the IMF’s assistance . 
It raises questions about the government’s frequent appeals to donors for financial aid and its willingness to enact economic reforms as a condition of that aid . 
Donors have expressed their concerns formally to the government and await a response . 
Donors are pushing regional energy market integration and the construction of power lines that will allow [LOC Tajikistan  ] and [LOC Kyrgyzstan  ] to sell surplus summer electricity output to [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
A 220 kW line from [LOC Tajikistan  ] to [LOC Afghanistan  ] is under construction with [ORG Asian Development Bank  ] financing , and will be finished in late 2010 . 
The larger [MISC CASA-1000  ] power line project to link to [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] has been delayed by financing problems . 
[LOC U.S.  ] ASSISTANCE <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( U ) [LOC U.S.  ] assistance to [LOC Tajikistan  ] will grow significantly to $45.3 million in [LOC FY  ] 2010 , from $27.8 million in [LOC FY  ] 2009 . 
The [LOC DUSHANBE  ] 00000173 004 OF 005 new money will go to agriculture , trade , and private sector initiatives to compensate for the loss of the much-needed food security programs . 
Until [LOC FY  ] 2008 [LOC Tajikistan  ] had a multi-year food aid program that had significant results reducing food insecurity in some of [MISC Tajikistan’s  ] most at-risk regions , followed by similar single-year programs in [LOC FY  ] 2009 and 2010 . 
A new [ORG Food Security Initiative  ] is in development , but it remains unclear whether [LOC Tajikistan  ] will receive any of those funds . 
New programs also will address chronic energy shortages by building a regional energy market and helping the [MISC Central Asian  ] states address water and power issues . 
[LOC Tajikistan  ] was awarded $9.9 million in [LOC FY  ] 2008 1207 funds to address stability issues . 
The major threats to stability arise from the [MISC Tajikistan’s  ] poverty -- the [ORG World Bank  ] estimates over 60% of the population lives below the poverty line -- and the government’s demonstrated inability to respond to emergencies . 
The 1207 project works in 50 isolated communities in the [LOC Rasht  ] and [LOC Fergana  ] valleys , and along the [MISC Afghan  ] frontier . 
Health and education deficiencies are so acute they imperil our progress in other areas . 
Our programs work to improve health policies , systems and services , teacher training , education finance , national curriculum , student assessment , and school governance . 
[ORG SECURITY COOPERATION  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [ORG Security Cooperation  ] remains a strong point in our relationship with [LOC Tajikistan  ] . 
The [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] volunteered last year for the first time to host [ORG CENTCOM’s Exercise Regional Cooperation  ] , including [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Kyrgyzstan  ] , and [LOC Kazakhstan  ] , which concluded August 10 . 
[ORG CENTCOM  ] and the [ORG Tajik Armed Forces  ] held Consultative Staff Talks in May and established the [LOC FY  ] 2010 [ORG Security Cooperation Plan  ] , which reflects [MISC Tajikistan’s  ] increased interest in demining and participation in the [MISC Global Peace Operations Initiative  ] ( [MISC GPOI  ] ) . 
The [ORG U.S. Army Humanitarian Demining Research and Development Office  ] will provide [LOC Tajikistan  ] a mechanical demining machine for field evaluation in [LOC FY  ] 2010 with a planned [ORG FMF  ] purchase in [LOC FY  ] 2011 . 
[LOC Tajikistan  ] reconfirmed its commitment to deploy a company-sized peacekeeping unit in 2011 . 
Training begins this month with a [ORG National Policy White Paper Workshop  ] that will help shape development in the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] and their [ORG Mobile Forces  ] . 
A General Staff level workshop and actual unit training will take place next year. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) The [ORG Nizhny Pyanj Bridge  ] and [ORG Point of Entry  ] facilities have improved the links between [LOC Tajikistan  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] significantly . 
Though the bridge is not being used to its fullest capacity , traffic is much heavier than the old ferry system , and continues to grow . 
Counts vary between 40 and 200 containers and transport trucks per day . 
[ORG CENTCOM  ] 2010funding at this facility will improve lighting , fences , and cameras , and parking areas . 
[LOC Tajikistan  ] is eager to see us make greater use of our agreement on transit of non-lethal goods to [LOC Afghanistan  ] through the [ORG Northern Distribution Network  ] ( [ORG NDN  ] ) , and hopes for economic benefits to [LOC Tajikistan  ] from this agreement . 
So far we have low rate truck traffic from [LOC Manas  ] through [LOC Tajikistan  ] to [LOC Bagram  ] . 
[ORG Defense Logistics Agency  ] is arranging to buy bottled water from a [MISC Tajik  ] producer for forces in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The [PER Tajiks  ] are looking for any way to circumvent [MISC Uzbekistan’s  ] stranglehold on their trade . 
US SOF ENGAGEMENT <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG U.S. Embassy  ] plans to continue to build the capacity and capability of select [LOC Tajikistan  ] security forces , in support of [ORG CENTCOM Joint Interagency Coordination Group  ] for [ORG Counter Narcotics  ] ( [ORG JIACG-CN  ] ) , and [LOC U.S.  ] government strategic themes , goals and objectives for [LOC Tajikistan  ] . 
Once SOCCENT forces have done an assessment and started organizing these groups into special units , the main goal is to sustain an increase in capabilities by [ORG U.S. Special Forces Joint Combined Exercise and Training  ] ( [ORG JCET  ] ) and [MISC Counter-narcotic  ] training ( CNT ) missions . 
[LOC DUSHANBE  ] 00000173 005 OF 005 NARCOTICS <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [LOC Tajikistan  ] is a major transit route for [MISC Afghan  ] heroin going to [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC Europe  ] . 
According to [ORG UN Office of Drugs and Crime  ] ( [ORG UNODC  ] ) estimates , 40 tons of [MISC Afghan  ] opiates enter [LOC Russia  ] each year via [LOC Tajikistan  ] . 
Less than 5% is seized before reaching [LOC Russia  ] . 
Capabilities of [MISC Tajik  ] law enforcement agencies are severely limited . 
Corruption is a major problem . 
Law enforcement agencies are reluctant to target well-connected traffickers , but are effective against low- and mid-level traffickers . 
The [ORG Drug Control Agency  ] ( [ORG DCA  ] ) is a ten-year-old , 400-officer agency developed through a [ORG UNODC  ] project . 
Many countries are donors , but an [MISC INL-funded  ] salary supplement program provides the primary funding . 
DCA’s liaison officers in [LOC Taloquan  ] in northern [LOC Afghanistan  ] were key to seizures totaling over 100 kilos of heroin in the last four months . 
[ORG U.S Drug Enforcement Agency  ] ( [ORG DEA  ] ) agents work with [ORG DCA  ] to deepen operations. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Until 2005 , the [MISC Russians  ] guarded the [MISC Tajik/Afghan  ] border ; after the [MISC Russians  ] departed , the outposts were broken down lean-tos , unfit for human habitation . 
The [ORG Tajik  ] [ORG Border Guard  ] force is staffed largely by conscripts who are poorly trained , poorly paid , underequipped and often under-fed . 
[ORG INL  ] rebuilt border posts , giving the [ORG Border Guards  ] suitable and safe places to live , creating conditions for successful border patrol operations . 
Each new outpost costs about $500,000 and houses more than 100 guards . 
The outposts use low-maintenance energy-efficient prefab construction and alternative energy , including solar , wind and micro-hydro power . 
We are planning a pilot project of joint [MISC Tajik/Afghan  ] border guard training in [LOC Khorog  ] . 
If successful , it will be part of the regular training of guards assigned to the [MISC Afghan/Tajik  ] border . 
We are exploring offering a popular Emergency First Responder course to a joint class of [MISC Tajik  ] and [MISC Afghan  ] border guards . 
[ORG INL  ] has rebuilt the [ORG Tajik Border Guard  ] academy . 
A [ORG U.S. Border Patrol  ] team plans to visit to discuss and demonstrate patrolling techniques at the [ORG Academy and  ] in the field ; this might lead to an exchange of instructors. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) [ORG CENTCOM’s Counter Narcotics  ] program is making strong contributions to [MISC Tajikistan’s  ] security . 
This year , $16.9 million in funding , recently approved in the [PER Supplemental Bill  ] , will support construction of an interagency [ORG National Training Center  ] , infrastructure at the [ORG Nizhny Pyanj Point of Entry  ] , and communications equipment . 
The [ORG Training Center  ] will be a multi-use facility for all ministries and serve as a venue for [MISC SOCCENT’s  ] bi-annual Counter [MISC Narco-Terrorism  ] training . 
A recent end-use monitoring visit demonstrated the [PER Tajiks  ] are using previously provided communications equipment and maintaining the equipment . 
This year , we will begin establishing an interagency communications architecture at [ORG Nizhny Pyanj  ] and the adjoining district . 
This will allow five government agencies to communicate using a compatible system .
