<code><pre>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 [LOC LISBON  ] 001812 SIPDIS SIPDIS FOR THE SECRETARY FROM CHARGE D'AFFAIRES [PER ADRIENNE O'NEAL  ] E.O. 12958: [LOC DECL:  ] 07/10/2017 TAGS: <a href='/tag/PREL_0.html'>PREL</a> <a href='/tag/PO_0.html'>PO</a> SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR YOUR VISIT TO [LOC PORTUGAL  ] JULY 19-20 Classified By: Charge d'Affaires [PER Adrienne O'Neal  ] for reasons 1.4 ( B ) an d ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Madam Secretary: Your visit -- at the beginning of [LOC Portugal  ] 's [ORG EU  ] presidency -- is particularly timely and provides an excellent opportunity to try to shape from the outset the [MISC Portuguese  ] government 's priorities in a direction consistent with [LOC U.S.  ] interests . 
[LOC Portugal  ] - Steadfast Ally ------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Portugal  ] , a founding member of [ORG NATO  ] , is a steadfast ally who has consistently stood by our side over the years despite various changes in government . 
The President and Prime Minister -- from opposing political parties -- each regularly stress that trans-Atlantic relations are a pillar of [MISC Portuguese  ] foreign policy and that [ORG NATO  ] is the primary guarantor of [MISC European  ] security. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Portugal  ] has provided virtually free access to [MISC Portuguese  ] air and seaports for military support operations in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] , with over three thousand flights a year transiting Lajes Air Base in the [LOC Azores  ] . 
Despite severe budgetary constraints , it is engaged internationally on numerous fronts with military personnel in [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( where it lost one soldier ) , [LOC East Timor  ] , [LOC Kosovo  ] , [LOC Bosnia  ] , and [LOC Lebanon  ] , and it is a member of the [ORG Proliferation Security Initiative  ] , the [ORG Container Security Initiative  ] , and the [ORG Global Initiative  ] to [ORG Combat Nuclear Terrorism  ] . 
[ORG EU  ] presidency priorities ----------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) While agreement on a treaty for [ORG EU  ] reform vice a Constitution was achieved during the [MISC German  ] presidency , detailed negotiation and signature of the treaty will fall to the [MISC Portuguese  ] presidency . 
This internal [ORG EU  ] task will not derail [LOC Portugal  ] , s external policy goals , but it will absorb scarce resources and high-level attention within the [MISC Portuguese  ] government , ensuring that we will need to motivate [LOC Portugal  ] on key issues. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Foreign Minister [PER Amado  ] has noted that the [ORG EU  ] , s biggest foreign policy concern is along its southern and southeastern borders , which are threatened by radical [MISC Islam  ] and poverty . 
He has proposed strengthening the [ORG EU  ] , s ties to [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC Moscow  ] , and [MISC Mediterranean  ] countries to help contain radical [MISC Islam  ] in that region ; this strategy includes supporting [MISC Turkish  ] accession to the [ORG EU  ] , involving the [ORG EU  ] more closely in the [LOC Middle East Peace Process  ] , and strengthening the [ORG EU  ] , s economic and cultural ties to the region through the [ORG Barcelona Process.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [MISC Portuguese  ] are expected to take a facilitative approach , in stark contrast with the aggressive leadership of [LOC Germany  ] , s presidency . 
They will seek broad consensus on most issues , dedicating their individual efforts to the few issues they care about: a strategic partnership with [LOC Africa  ] and the [LOC Middle East  ] processes noted above . 
Beyond those issues , the [MISC Portuguese  ] governmental structure is occupied with a series of summits with [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC India  ] , [LOC China  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC Ukraine  ] , and [MISC Africa.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The just completed [PER EU-Brazil Summit  ] was successful in establishing a long-term relationship with a significant partner and energizing the debate in [LOC Europe  ] on biofuels . 
[MISC Portuguese  ] interlocutors candidly told us that they did not expect much and that the summit was only the first step toward an EU-Brazil strategic partnership , but that they were delighted with the outcome . 
We believe this may raise [MISC Portuguese  ] ambitions for the other summits . 
Suggested areas of focus ------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [MISC Kosovo:  ] The [MISC Portuguese  ] support the [PER Ahtisaari  ] proposal but have no alternative to having the [MISC Russians  ] on board . 
They have seized on the idea of delaying the introduction of a [ORG UN Resolution  ] while further talks continue and have no plans on how to react if the [MISC Kosovars  ] declare independence unilaterally . 
[PER A/S Fried  ] , s July 9 appeal to the [MISC Kosovars  ] not to do so pleased the [MISC Portuguese  ] , but they need to understand that leaving [LOC Kosovo  ] in limbo is not an option and that the [MISC Kosovars'  ] patience -- even with [LOC US  ] pressure -- is finite. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Russia: Prime Minister [PER Socrates  ] visited [LOC Moscow  ] recently and was criticized in many quarters for his failure to address aggressive behavior against allies [LOC Poland  ] and [LOC Estonia  ] , human rights issues , or [LOC Moscow  ] , s penchant for [LOC LISBON  ] 00001812 002 OF 003 rhetoric and gamesmanship on energy and security . 
Indeed , [PER Socrates  ] , advisors suggested to us following the trip that we needed to tone down our own rhetoric in order to make various negotiations more fruitful. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [LOC Middle East:  ] The [MISC Portuguese  ] believe they have little historical baggage in the region and thus can advance progress on key issues . 
They have stressed many times and at the highest levels that the [ORG Road Map  ] is the way forward , but that it needs to be reinvigorated . 
Foreign Minister [PER Amado  ] backed away from the recent [MISC Mediterranean  ] FMs , letter to Quartet Representative [PER Tony Blair  ] -- which he signed -- stating that &the [ORG Road Map  ] has failed , 8 and a senior advisor was dismissive of the letter , s text , saying neither the [ORG EU  ] nor the [MISC Portuguese  ] position has changed . 
[PER Amado  ] has traveled extensively to the [LOC Middle East  ] and was one of the first to call for a special session of [ORG EU  ] Foreign Ministers at the onset of last summer , s hostilities in [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
[LOC Portugal  ] was prepared to commit forces to any potential peacekeeping force , even before the structure and sponsorship of such a force had been established . 
[LOC Portugal  ] eventually sent a company of [ORG Army  ] engineers to help with reconstruction . 
[PER Amado  ] told us that he sees [LOC Iran  ] as the greatest threat since WWII , and his ministry has been supportive of tough measures in light of [LOC Iran  ] 's refusal to halt nuclear enrichment. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Afghanistan: [MISC Portuguese  ] Special Forces and other troops serve without caveat and are engaged in heavy fighting . 
The current company is scheduled to depart in February 2008 and replacements have not yet been designated or funded . 
The [MISC Portuguese  ] stress that they are with us in [LOC Afghanistan  ] for the duration of [ORG NATO  ] operations , so congratulations for their current contributions are in order as well as encouragement to continue . 
[LOC Portugal  ] has contributed $2 million in assistance ; however , they are financially over-stretched and have not done more because of that. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Iraq: [LOC Portugal  ] contributed gendarme trainers for the [MISC NTM-I  ] police training mission . 
[LOC Portugal  ] recently downsized its diplomatic presence in [LOC Baghdad  ] because of cost ( its operations were four times as expensive as any other embassy ) , but let us know far in advance and wanted to coordinate what they said publicly as they were sensitive to the political ramifications. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Africa: [LOC Portugal  ] has a special relationship with [LOC Africa  ] , particularly with its former colonies . 
It intends to host an [PER EU-Africa Summit  ] , although it has deferred diplomatic conflict over the [LOC Zimbabwe  ] question , even though the [LOC UK  ] , the [LOC Netherlands  ] , and others may not attend at the head of government level should [PER Mugabe  ] attend . 
Although the [MISC Portuguese  ] have led the development of an action plan between the [ORG EU  ] and [ORG African Union  ] , the negative ramifications of [PER Mugabe  ] 's presence in [LOC Lisbon  ] could overshadow any accomplishments . 
Particular Bilateral Points ------------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [LOC SBU  ] ) [LOC Portugal  ] , s interest in [LOC Africa  ] for the [ORG EU  ] presidency is a good opportunity to underscore the progress in US-Portugal cooperation to strengthen security and stability in [LOC Africa  ] . 
When Foreign Minister [PER Amado  ] was still Defense Minister , he strongly encouraged trilateral cooperation between the [LOC US  ] , [LOC Portugal  ] , and individual [MISC African  ] countries on security issues in [LOC Africa  ] . 
Since that time , we have conducted joint demining training in [LOC Guinea-Bissau  ] and begun developing an [MISC HIV  ] prevention program among [MISC African  ] armed forces . 
We hope to include the [MISC Portuguese  ] in peacekeeping training in [LOC Mozambique  ] and [LOC Angola  ] under the [MISC African  ] Contingency Operations training and Assistance ( [ORG ACOTA  ] ) program and a joint State-Defense team from [LOC Washington  ] hopes to visit [LOC Lisbon  ] this fall to discuss further opportunities. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( S/NF ) [PER Amado  ] agreed to allow the repatriation of prisoners through [LOC Lajes Air Base  ] on a case-by-case basis under limited circumstances . 
This was a difficult decision , given the sustained criticism by [MISC Portuguese  ] media and leftist elements of his own party of the government , s handling of the [ORG CIA  ] rendition flights controversy . 
[PER Amado  ] , s agreement has never been made public . 
The Attorney General , s [ORG Office  ] was forced to review a dossier of news clippings and unsubstantiated allegations regarding [ORG CIA  ] rendition operations through [LOC Portugal  ] provided by a member of the [ORG European Parliament  ] . 
The AG , s report should be released in the very near future . 
Although we cannot predict its conclusions , government insiders and legal scholars have told us there was no useful or prosecutable information in the dossier . 
[LOC LISBON  ] 00001812 003 OF 003 Prime Minister [PER Socrates  ] ----------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [PER Socrates  ] is a telegenic and charismatic leader , who worked hard to improve his [MISC English  ] in advance of the [ORG EU  ] presidency . 
He relies on advice from a small circle of advisors . 
He is a very moderate Socialist who has been successful at co-opting or marginalizing the leftists in his party . 
He also aggressively pursued his domestic agenda before assuming the [ORG EU  ] presidency , achieving difficult labor and social security reforms and reducing [LOC Portugal  ] , s budget deficit to near EU-mandated levels . 
Foreign Minister [PER Amado  ] ---------------------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) You met with [PER Amado  ] last October in [LOC Washington  ] and have spoken with him in person and on the telephone several times since . 
He has been a great friend of the [LOC US  ] , both in his previous capacity as Minister of Defense and now as Foreign Minister . 
He is even-tempered , thoughtful , and low-key , and regularly seeks opportunities to coordinate policy with the [LOC US  ] . 
He places great importance on presenting a united public front , whether within the [ORG EU  ] , [ORG NATO  ] or with the [LOC US  ] . 
If there are differences , he prefers to discuss them discreetly behind closed doors . 
President [PER Cavaco Silva  ] ---------------------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [PER Cavaco Silva  ] is the most popular politician in [LOC Portugal  ] , even though his center-right party badly trails [PER Socrates  ] , Socialist Party in polls . 
Although the [MISC Portuguese  ] presidency does not wield the executive power of the [LOC US  ] presidency , the position is not ceremonial . 
[PER Cavaco Silva  ] is commander in chief of the armed forces and must approve all military deployments and chairs the [ORG Council of State  ] , which handles all constitutional issues . 
[PER Cavaco Silva  ] considers former President [PER George H.W. Bush  ] a personal friend , with whom he developed a close relationship during his years as Prime Minister from 1985-95 . 
The elder President [PER Bush  ] attended [PER Cavaco Silva  ] , s presidential inauguration in March <a id='par2006' href='#par2006'>¶</a>2006 . 
[PER Cavaco Silva  ] was displeased that he did not get an [ORG Oval Office  ] meeting with President [PER George W. Bush  ] during his recent visit to [LOC Washington  ] to open a Smithsonian exhibition of [MISC Portuguese  ] art , and he declined the former President [PER Bush  ] , s offer to visit [LOC Kennebunkport  ] .
