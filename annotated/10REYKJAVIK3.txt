This decision throws [LOC Iceland  ] 's political and economic future into complete uncertainty , leaving politicians and pundits alike wondering what happens next . 
End summary . 
President Sends Issue to [LOC National Referendum  ] --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The President of [LOC Iceland  ] , [PER Olafur Ragnar Grimsson  ] , announced at a press conference on January 5 that he has decided not to sign the [ORG Icesave  ] legislation passed by the parliament on December 30 . 
This decision sends the [ORG Icesave  ] issue to a national referendum where it is widely expected to fail . 
The President cited a petition , signed by nearly one-quarter of the electorate , and public opinion polls as the basis for his decision . 
" It has steadily become more apparent that the people must be convinced that they themselves determine the future course . 
The involvement of the whole nation in the final decision is therefore the prerequisite for a successful solution , reconciliation and recovery , " said the [MISC President.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The constitution is vague regarding when a referendum must take place , saying only that it should occur " as soon as circumstances permit . 
" [PER Emboff  ] spoke with Dr. [PER Ragnhildur Helgadottir  ] , a constitutional lawyer and an advisor to the [MISC Icelandic  ] parliament , who said that legislation legalizing a national referendum must pass before the referendum itself can occur . 
There are currently two bills in the parliament , both of which have gone through the first round of discussions , that address the mechanics of holding a national referendum . 
One bill was initiated by the Prime Minister and the other by the political party called The Movement . 
Both of these bills suggest that a referendum should take place within two months after a President rejects signing a bill into law . 
[PER Helgadottir  ] said that it is highly likely the parliament , which is currently on vacation , will reconvene shortly and further discuss these two bills , as legislation must be passed before the country can conduct a national referendum. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Should a national referendum reject the [ORG Icesave  ] bill , or should the bill be withdrawn before a referendum can occur , the previous legislation passed in August will remain in force ( reftel C ) . 
That law , although it guaranteed [LOC Iceland  ] 's repayment of its debts , was unacceptable to the [MISC British  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] governments because it contained troubling amendments such as an end date for repayment regardless of whether the debts were paid in full . 
In a meeting for the diplomatic corps on January 5 , officials at the [ORG MFA  ] said that even if a referendum rejects the current [ORG Icesave  ] bill , [LOC Iceland  ] has still pledged to meet its international obligations via the August law . 
They seemed to be indicating that [LOC Iceland  ] would stand behind the previous bill with the hope that the [MISC British  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] might now find it acceptable in light of recent developments . 
Political Fallout ----------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Prime Minister [PER Johanna Sigurdardottir  ] addressed the media shortly after the President 's statement and said that his decision came as a complete surprise to the government . 
[PER Sigurdardottir  ] stated that the government was extremely disappointed with the decision of the President not to sign the [ORG Icesave  ] bill into law , saying that he has placed the rebuilding of [LOC Iceland  ] 's economy and international reputation into turmoil . 
The [ORG PM  ] questioned whether it was right for the President to be involved in an issue such as [ORG Icesave  ] , as it was first and foremost a bilateral issue between the [ORG GOI  ] and the [MISC British  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] governments . 
( Note: the President 's role is largely ceremonial . 
End note . 
) Many members of parliament and analysts had previously predicted that the government would resign if its decision was overturned and the [ORG Icesave  ] matter went to a national referendum . 
When asked if the coalition would resign , however , the [ORG PM  ] would neither confirm nor exclude the possibility . 
The [ORG PM  ] ended the press conference by saying that the parliamentary groups of the ruling coalition would meet later in the day to review the situation. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The President 's decision also casts serious doubts on [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000003 002.2 OF 002 [LOC Iceland  ] 's application to join the [ORG European Union  ] . 
Several experts have posited that the [MISC British  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] may now block [LOC Iceland  ] 's application in retaliation for this decision . 
[PER Baldur Thorhallsson  ] , a professor who is considered one of the country 's foremost experts on [LOC Iceland  ] 's [ORG EU  ] candidacy , told [PER Emboff  ] that the [LOC UK  ] and the [LOC Netherlands  ] are almost certain to block [LOC Iceland  ] 's efforts to join the [ORG EU  ] unless a compromise is reached over [ORG Icesave  ] . 
Prior to this development , the [ORG EU  ] Commission was widely expected to endorse [LOC Iceland  ] 's candidacy and negotiations were expected to begin shortly after the next [ORG EU  ] summit in March . 
In the meeting with the diplomatic corps , the [ORG MFA  ] , on the other hand , stressed that [LOC Iceland  ] 's [ORG EU  ] application and the [ORG Icesave  ] issue are not and should not be linked . 
Economic Fallout ---------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The President 's decision is expected to have substantial economic implications and further delay [LOC Iceland  ] 's already stunted economic recovery . 
The $2.1 billion [ORG IMF  ] program , created under the assumption that the [ORG Icesave  ] bill would pass and the country would have access to the $2.5 billion loan from the [MISC Nordic  ] countries , will require significant reworking ( reftel B ) . 
An [ORG IMF  ] employee told [PER Emboff  ] that the [ORG IMF  ] does not intend to issue an immediate statement and that nothing may be forthcoming for several days . 
The credit agencies are also expected to downgrade [LOC Iceland  ] to junk status , further limiting the country 's efforts to regularize international financial flows. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG PM  ] [PER Sigurdardottir  ] , in response to the President 's announcement , stated that uncertainty regarding financial commitments to other countries could have serious , damaging consequences for the [MISC Icelandic  ] nation . 
Both she and the Finance Minister stated that the government wants to prevent [LOC Iceland  ] from obtaining the reputation of a country that does not fulfill its commitments . 
Her office shortly thereafter released a statement saying that " the government of [LOC Iceland  ] remains fully committed to implementing the bilateral loan agreements and thus the state guarantee provided for by the law . 
" Comment ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The President 's decision , and the manner in which he delivered it , highlight the deep divisions impeding the efficacy of the [MISC Icelandic  ] government . 
Despite meeting with government leaders on Sunday to discuss the matter , the members of the ruling coalition only learned of the President 's decision from watching the press conference . 
The Prime Minister and Finance Minister recognize the importance of maintaining international political and financial relationships , yet their credibility has now suffered a serious blow as they scramble to do damage control . 
It is too soon to tell how the dust will settle ; however , concerns regarding the viability of the current government , the country 's [ORG EU  ] application , and [LOC Iceland  ] 's economic recovery are all valid .
