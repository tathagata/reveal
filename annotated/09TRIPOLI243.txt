REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) According to [PER Suliman Abdalla Ismail  ] , the [MISC Sudanese  ] [ORG Justice  ] and [ORG Equality Movement  ] 's [ORG /Khalil Ibrahim Faction  ] ( [ORG JEM/KI  ] ) [MISC Tripoli-based  ] representative , the March 15 agreement signed in [LOC Tripoli  ] between five [MISC Sudanese  ] rebel groups and [MISC Qatari  ] Minister of State al-Mahmoud may help mediators structure peace talks more efficiently , but will likely be ineffective due to the minor role the rebel groups play in [LOC Darfur  ] and the impunity with which the [ORG Bashir  ] government has acted since the issuance of the [ORG ICC  ] arrest warrant for President [ORG Bashir  ] . 
In a meeting with Poloff March 16 , [PER Ismail  ] characterized the talks ( reftel ) as an attempt by [LOC Libya  ] to reassert its role in [LOC Darfur  ] mediation . 
[PER Ismail  ] was dismissive of the rebel groups represented , noting that " most of them only represent themselves and have no movement " . 
SLA/Juba consisted of only a chairman , secretary general , and a military commander but lacked troops and civilian support , he said . 
2 . 
( C ) [PER Ismail  ] conceded that it was important for the Government of [LOC Sudan  ] ( [ORG GOS  ] ) to engage with all rebel groups to reach cease-fire agreements and that consolidation would make that process more manageable . 
He downplayed , however , the potential for the " [MISC Unity Plus  ] " coalition to engage in meaningful negotiation with the [ORG GOS  ] since " there is not one [ORG SLA  ] , there are 15 or 16 factions and no one has control , " and the [ORG GOS  ] was unwilling to negotiate due to the [ORG ICC  ] prosecution of [ORG Bashir  ] . 
He also warned that [MISC Egyptian  ] and [MISC Libyan  ] influence must be carefully monitored , saying " JEM invites discussions with neighbors to find peace . 
If they will only unify factions , this is okay . 
If they want another peace table , it will hurt negotiations " . 
3 . 
( C ) Commenting on JEM 's relations with [LOC Libya  ] , [PER Ismail  ] said contact with the [ORG GOL  ] had become less frequent over the past six months . 
[ORG JEM/KI  ] and [PER SLA/Abdul Wahid  ] were not invited to the March 15 meeting , a slight [PER Ismail  ] attributed to [LOC Libya  ] 's anger that JEM had sent a delegation to the [LOC U.S  ] to discuss the [LOC Doha  ] peace process and to lobby for sanctions against [LOC Khartoum  ] and other measures - a no-fly zone , an " oil for food " sanction program , and a " free zone " for rebel talks . 
[PER Ismail  ] said that the [LOC US  ] should show more support for the [LOC Doha  ] process and be wary of [MISC Libyan  ] intervention . 
" Look at what [ Muammar al-Qadhafi ] did in [LOC Mauritania  ] " . 
4 . 
( C ) Comment: This was our first meeting with [PER Ismail  ] , who contacted the embassy through email addresses found on the embassy website . 
Seemingly well-informed , he dutifully " demarched " poloff on JEM talking points and was versed in [LOC Libya  ] 's [LOC Darfur  ] activities . 
He was frank and openly critical of [LOC Libya  ] 's record in [LOC Darfur  ] despite the watchful eyes of his [MISC Libyan  ] minders a few tables away . 
End Comment .
