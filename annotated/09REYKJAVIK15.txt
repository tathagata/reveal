[PER Carol van Voorst  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . 
REFS: A ) [ORG Reykjavik  ] 13 B ) Evans - [ORG Reykjavik Morning Update  ] emails 1/23/09 1 . 
( C ) [ORG Summary:  ] The [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] 's report on [LOC Iceland  ] 's economic health this week forecast a dismal eighteen months before recovery . 
This assessment was echoed by the new Chairman of the [ORG Government Coordinating Committee  ] , [PER Mats Josefsson  ] , who is charged with creating a framework for restructuring the banking sector . 
Restructuring has been slow , but seems to be headed in the right direction , and [PER Josefsson  ] is confident that the [ORG IMF  ] will be satisfied with their mid-February review . 
However , problems persist , such as the lack of an overall " [MISC Economic Czar  ] " for [LOC Iceland  ] to deal with other issues like the currency depreciation . 
Recent public unrest and uncertainty on the political scene are also complicating . 
Also unresolved are the issues with the old banks' creditors and the negotiations to settle the unsecured [MISC IceSave  ] deposit accounts . 
Overall , the situation is tough and stressful and is testing the fortitude of the [MISC Icelandic  ] people as well as their government . 
We expect that matters will deteriorate further before recovering . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) " The [MISC Icelandic  ] economy is heading for a deep recession in 2009 that is forecast to reach a trough in the first half of 2010 , " concludes the [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] produced national economic forecast released this week . 
The summary goes on to say that Real GDP declined by a small margin in 2008 , but is predicted to decline by 9.6 percent in 2009 . 
Unemployment , previously at 1.7 percent in 2008 , is predicted to average 7.8 percent in 2009 and 8.6 percent in <a id='par2010' href='#par2010'>¶</a>2010 . 
Inflation , calculated at 12.4 percent in 2008 , is expected to increase to 13.1 percent in 2009 and then decline to average 2.7 percent in 2010 . 
The report recognizes that there " is considerably more uncertainty than before about most elements of the forecast " as the model relied on historically measured relationships , some of which have likely changed since the collapse of the banking system. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Mats Josefsson  ] , newly appointed Chairman of the [ORG Coordination Committee  ] , and [PER Gudmundur Arnason  ] , newly assigned Director of Special Projects at the Prime Minister 's Office , echoed these predictions to Econoff on January 23 . 
[PER Josefsson  ] 's mandate is to create a framework for restructuring the banking sector , and [PER Arnason  ] " makes sure the recommendations of the [ORG Committee  ] are implemented by the ministers . 
" [PER Josefsson  ] remarked that the government had let the banks handle everything over the last ten years and there was not the infrastructure in place to deal with the crisis . 
This led to inaction , and in hindsight , more could have been done more quickly in October . 
However , [PER Josefsson  ] said that the attitude is changing in the government and " there is a realization that things have to happen . 
" He also said that he has advised the Icelanders that it is better to do things on their own before being told by the [ORG IMF  ] to do things " the [ORG IMF  ] way . 
" [PER Josefsson  ] said that changes take time , but the direction is good and he was optimistic that the [ORG IMF  ] will be satisfied with the first review. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Regarding the banking sector , [PER Josefsson  ] said the new banks still need to be capitalized and must start lending , as a functioning banking system is necessary for the economy to recover . 
He said the business plans of the banks are [LOC OK  ] , but the new banks need " to be cleaned up . 
" He further clarified that since the creation of the new banks , some of the healthy assets moved from the old banks to the new banks have deteriorated . 
Most of these are related to corporate loans and this debt needs to be restructured . 
( [ORG Note: Businesses  ] are heavily in debt with foreign currency loans and with the krona 's devaluation , and many are unable to service their debt . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Josefsson  ] said that since the old banks are in moratorium ( court administration ) , creditors must address issues with the [ORG Resolution Committees  ] , and not lobby the Prime Minister 's office . 
He said that the [ORG Resolution Committees  ] need to be affirmed by the court to prevent committee members , or the Government who appointed them , from being sued . 
Financial advisors are in place at the banks , but the Government of [LOC Iceland  ] , which is also a creditor , needs to have its own voice before these [ORG Committees  ] . 
Once that official , whom [PER Josefsson  ] called a " spokesperson , " is in place , then all the parties can get together to talk . 
[PER Josefsson  ] said there has been discussion about the bond or instrument that the new banks would provide as value for the assets removed from the old banks . 
He saw these bond negotiations taking two to three months , because some want to wait until the new banks start increasing in value to pass some of this value to the old banks , but the government did not want to pass back all of the value . 
He said the old banks' value still needs to be assessed and there has been some delay because it is very expensive to hire the necessary experts , who [PER Josefsson  ] felt were " taking advantage " of the situation for financial gain. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) When the [ORG U.S. Department of Treasury Deputy Assistant  ] Secretary visited [ORG Reykjavik  ] December 8 - 9 , 2008 , there was a visible lack of an " [MISC Economic Czar  ] . 
" It took two full days of meetings to obtain a coherent picture of the economic situation . 
In December , the Advisor at the Prime Minister 's Office [PER Bjorn Runar Gudmundsson  ] , described his office as playing a coordinating role , but conceded REYKJAVIK 00000015 002 OF 002 there was a lot of misunderstanding and difficulty in getting " everyone to talk the same language . 
" [PER Gudmundsson  ] had noted that the initial crisis was not managed well , coordination had been difficult , and that tensions in the political arena had been stirred up . 
[PER Gudmundsson  ] had mentioned three priorities - the currency , the fiscal policy , and the banks . 
Now in January 2009 , it appears [PER Josefsson  ] has the banking sector reform laid out , but [PER Josefsson  ] was clear that his mandate does not extend to exchange rate issues . 
Also complicating matters is the current uptick in public unrest ( Ref A ) and the announcement the Prime Minister will retire from politics in March because he has cancer of the esophagus ( Ref B ) . 
[PER Josefsson  ] said political stability is important as there has to be a government in place to implement these necessary changes. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Further unresolved are the negotiations with the [LOC U.K.  ] , the [LOC Netherlands  ] and [LOC Germany  ] on the unsecured [MISC IceSave  ] deposit accounts . 
At the [ORG Ministry for Foreign Affairs  ] , [PER Martin Eyjolfsson  ] , the lead negotiator , said that the parties have agreement on the principle of paying the [ORG EU  ] minimum deposit guarantee . 
However , to make the payments , [LOC Iceland  ] will have to borrow from the other states in the short term , and disagreements persist on the interest rate , length of loan , grace period , and other terms . 
In mid-December , [PER Eyjolfsson  ] described the [MISC British  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] representatives as presenting a united front in the meetings , but having separate views on interest rates . 
The [MISC British  ] wanted a 6.7 percent loan , which [PER Eyjolfsson  ] said could block [LOC Iceland  ] from meeting the [MISC Maastricht  ] requirements and bar [LOC Iceland  ] from the [MISC Euro .  ] 
[PER Eyjolfsson  ] said for every one percent in interest on the loan , there will need to be a corresponding 1.5 percent decrease in the state budget . 
[PER Eyjolfsson  ] told Econoff January 22 that negotiations were still ongoing and the next meeting with the [MISC British  ] , [MISC Dutch  ] and [MISC Germans  ] together , was set for the first week of [LOC February.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Comment: Overall  ] , the aftermath of the October 2008 banking sector meltdown continues to test [MISC Icelandic  ] fortitude , inside and outside government . 
All indications are that the economic situation will deteriorate further before recovering . 
Icelanders have a tradition of being flexible and hardworking . 
If they can adapt and endure the next six to 18 months , then they will have made it through the worst . 
However , the recent political turmoil and grave illnesses of the leaders of both Coalition parties only adds to the difficulties of recovery . 
End Comment .
