( C ) [MISC Summary: Over  ] the past week , President [PER Chavez  ] and his supporters have stepped up attacks against two opposition governors , [PER Cesar Perez Vivas  ] ( [ORG Tachira  ] ) and [PER Henrique  ] [PER Capriles Radonski  ] ( [PER Miranda  ] ) . 
[PER Chavez  ] is blaming [PER Perez Vivas  ] for several highly-publicized violent incidents along the [MISC Colombian  ] border ( septel ) , alleging that he has ties to [MISC Colombian  ] paramilitary groups . 
The [ORG Comptroller General  ] agreed to investigate corruption charges against [PER Capriles  ] brought by [PER Chavez  ] 's [ORG United Socialist Party of Venezuela  ] ( [ORG PSUV  ] ) , which could result in a 15-year disqualification from public office . 
[ORG PSUV  ] youth members and [ORG National Assembly  ] ( [ORG AN  ] ) Deputies have called for investigations of a number of other opposition figures on allegations of corruption and espionage . 
These attacks are akin to the smear campaign [PER Chavez  ] waged before the past two elections to discredit or disqualify particularly popular or vocal opposition figures . 
End Summary. --------------------------------------------- [PER CHAVEZ  ] ALLEGES PEREZ VIVAS' PARAMILITARY TIES --------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On November 3 , [PER Chavez  ] publicly linked [ORG Tachira  ] Governor [PER Cesar Perez Vivas  ] with violence along the border with [LOC Colombia  ] , alleging that paramilitaries tied to the Governor had been responsible for the November 2 killing of two members of the [ORG Venezuelan National Guard  ] . 
[PER Chavez  ] announced that [PER Perez Vivas  ] " is committed to the paramilitary plan and we cannot permit it... heed the consequences . 
There was one person who went running for [LOC Peru  ] , ( [PER Perez Vivas  ] ) is going to have to do the same . 
" ( [PER Notes: Since Perez Vivas'  ] election in 2008 , [PER Chavez  ] has repeatedly claimed he was linked to the [MISC Colombian  ] paramilitaries . 
[PER Manuel Rosales  ] , former [LOC Maracaibo Mayor  ] and 2006 Presidential candidate , sought political asylum in [LOC Lima  ] in April 2009 after being charged with corruption . 
End Notes . 
) [PER Chavez  ] also suggested that the opposition Mayor of [LOC Tachira  ] 's capital city , [LOC San Cristobal  ] , [PER Monica de Mendez  ] , should respond before a tribunal , just like the Governor . 
" In a press conference in [LOC San Cristobal  ] the same day , Vice President and Minister of [ORG Defense  ] [PER Ramon Carrizalez  ] echoed [PER Chavez  ] 's comments and said the Governor has " one foot in jail " and pledged he would fight against [PER Perez Vivas'  ] " dirty war . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Perez Vivas  ] responded November 4 that the charges were part of a " file " the [ORG GBRV  ] had fabricated , with the assistance of [MISC Cuban  ] intelligence services , to discredit him . 
He asserted to the local press that the central government was blaming paramilitary groups for the recent deaths in [LOC Tachira  ] to " protect [MISC Colombian  ] guerrillas " that had taken refuge in the area . 
He added that [PER Chavez  ] was trying to remove him from power , asserting that the [ORG GBRV  ] " doesn't have a way to eliminate me ... so they are in their laboratories looking for what they can fabricate to blame me . 
" --------------------------------------------- ----------- [ORG National Assembly  ] Investigates the Opposition as " Spies " --------------------------------------------- ----------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On November 3 , the [ORG AN  ] approved a proposal submitted by [ORG AN  ] Vice President [PER Saul Ortega  ] to investigate travel to [LOC Colombia  ] by key opposition leaders , alleging that they have been involved in espionage against [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
The named individuals are: [ORG Miranda State  ] Governor [PER Henrique Capriles Radonski  ] , [ORG Tachira State  ] Governor [PER Cesar Perez Vivas  ] , former Ambassador [PER Milos Alcalay  ] , former [MISC Chacao  ] Mayor [PER Leopoldo Lopez  ] , Mayor of [ORG Greater Caracas Antonio Ledezma  ] , former student leader [PER Yon Goicochea  ] , and exiled opposition leader [PER Manuel Rosales  ] . 
[PER Ortega  ] asserted that the opposition 's " unity table " had been in [LOC Colombia  ] in the past few months and days and that the former head of [LOC Colombia  ] 's [ORG Administrative Department of Security  ] ( [ORG DAS  ] ) had said they were plotting against the [MISC Venezuelan  ] government. --------------------------------------------- ---------- [ORG Comptroller Pursues Corruption Charges  ] against [PER Capriles  ] --------------------------------------------- ---------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On October 27 , the General [PER Comptroller  ] ( " [ORG Contraloria General  ] " ) accepted corruption charges brought against [PER Miranda State  ] Governor [PER Henrique Capriles Radonski  ] . 
[LOC CARACAS  ] 00001417 002.2 OF 002 The charges were levied on August 26 by the [ORG PSUV  ] based on Capriles' tenure as Mayor of [LOC Baruta  ] municipality ( part of greater [LOC Caracas  ] ) between 2000-2008 . 
The [ORG PSUV  ] alleged " financial irregularities " involving several companies owned by [PER Capriles  ] and his family , including purported tax evasion related to the sale of two plots of land valued at USD 1.8 million . 
[ORG PSUV  ] representatives claimed October 27 that [PER Capriles  ] would have to present himself before the [ORG Comptroller 's Office  ] the following week . 
( Note: These " administrative " charges are distinct from the legal case brought against [PER Capriles  ] for his alleged involvement in violence outside the [MISC Cuban  ] Embassy during the 2002 coup against [PER Chavez  ] . 
Although the latter case could be reopened , post is not aware that any legal steps have been taken to do so . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Lawyer [PER Rafael Chavero  ] told [PER Poloff  ] on November 2 that the next step would be for the [PER Comptroller  ] to begin an administrative investigation into the case against [PER Capriles  ] , which could result in a determination of an " administrative irregularity . 
" He said that if [PER Capriles  ] was found responsible , the [ORG Comptroller General  ] could " disqualify " ( " inhabilitar " ) [PER Capriles  ] for up to 15 years without the need for any court decision . 
He noted that this power has been used extensively by the [ORG GBRV  ] in the past -- most famously to disqualify over 200 candidates in advance of the 2008 municipal and gubernatorial elections -- and called it a " fundamental tool used ( by the [ORG GBRV  ] ) to remove political adversaries from the game . 
" ------------------------------------------ ...AND POSSIBLY AGAINST LEDEZMA AND [PER GARCIA  ] ------------------------------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Several youth members of the [ORG PSUV  ] urged the [ORG Comptroller 's Office  ] on October 30 to open an investigation into Mayor of [ORG Greater Caracas Antonio Ledezma  ] 's trip to [LOC Brazil  ] . 
According to the state-owned media , the trip cost USD 20,000 . 
The [ORG PSUV  ] representatives asserted that an investigation was necessary " to explain to the country where these resources were taken from , in order ( for [PER Ledezma  ] ) to carry out political tourism... throughout [LOC Latin America  ] and [LOC Europe  ] . 
" [PER Ledezma  ] has claimed the funding for his mid-October trip to [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Spain  ] , and [LOC France  ] came from private sources ( reftel ) . <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG PSUV  ] officials claimed October 27 to also have corruption evidence against opposition political party " Podemos " founder and AN Deputy [PER Ismael Garcia  ] . 
Although [PER Garcia  ] enjoys immunity from prosecution as an AN Deputy , that immunity could be lifted through a vote in the [LOC AN.  ] ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Of all the charges , those against [PER Perez Vivas  ] appear to be the most threatening , given the increased tensions with [LOC Colombia  ] and [PER Chavez  ] 's pledge that the Governor could be forced into exile . 
The charges against [PER Capriles  ] , one of the opposition 's most popular figures , smack of political revenge due to Capriles' long-running rivalry with his predecessor and [PER Chavez  ] ally [PER Diosdado Cabello  ] and his repeated calls for a corruption investigation into [PER Cabello  ] 's gubernatorial administration . 
Disqualifying [PER Capriles  ] from running for public office in the foreseeable future could both derail his political career and intimidate other opposition officials .
