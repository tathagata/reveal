( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] The investigation against four former [ORG GTMO  ] detainees ( reftels A and B ) appears to be proceeding well ; all appeals for pre-trial release have been denied and the investigating judges feel confident that the trial , likely to begin this summer , will result in conviction . 
However , in a related action , [LOC France  ] 's highest appeals court for criminal matters overturned two previous courts' decisions and referred , to the [ORG Paris Court of Appeals  ] for action , a complaint brought by the families of two ex-GTMO detainees requesting an investigation into their detention. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Summary continued: Separately , the public trial against suspected terrorist [PER Djamel Beghal  ] and five accomplices accused of plotting to attack [LOC US  ] interests in [LOC France  ] , including an attack against the [ORG Embassy  ] , began January 3 . 
Thus far , the trial has been highlighted by the defiance of the defendants during questioning . 
Post will continue to report on these cases , as well as that of [PER Mohamed al-Jundi  ] , the [MISC Syrian  ] driver of the two [MISC French  ] journalists kidnapped in [LOC Iraq  ] ( septel ) . 
Al-Jundi filed suit against [LOC U.S.  ] forces alleging torture while in [LOC U.S.  ] custody following his liberation from insurgent captivity . 
End summary . 
EX-GTMO DETAINEES ----------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The ongoing investigation against the four ex-GTMO detainees currently in [MISC French  ] custody is progressing well and the trial is likely to begin this summer . 
Thus far , all appeals by defense attorneys for the release of their clients from pre-trial detention have been rejected . 
A recent defense appeal to obtain transcripts from alleged interrogations by [MISC French  ] authorities while the detainees were still at [ORG GTMO  ] was similarly denied . 
The anti-terrorism judges investigating the case communicate regularly with Post , and they are confident the evidence obtained by [MISC French  ] authorities since the four were remanded to [MISC French  ] custody is overwhelming. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [LOC France  ] 's highest appeals court , the [ORG Cour de Cassation  ] , ruled January 4 that the [ORG Paris Court of Appeals  ] would have to address a complaint filed by the families of two former [ORG GTMO  ] detainees seeking a criminal investigation into certain unknown and unnamed persons ( undoubtedly [LOC U.S.  ] officials ) for the illegal detention of the two in [LOC Guantanamo  ] . 
The complaint had initially been filed in 2002 and was dismissed by a judge in [ORG Lyon  ] . 
The [ORG Lyon Court of Appeals  ] upheld this initial decision in 2003 , arguing that that the detention could not be investigated because it was the result of an [MISC American  ] military operation covered by a unanimously adopted [ORG UN  ] resolution . 
However , yesterday 's appeal court decision indicated that the complaint could not be dismissed without investigating whether there was evidence related to the complaint that could be applicable under [MISC French  ] law . 
The complaint is now remanded to the [ORG Paris Court of Appeals  ] , which technically could rule with the [ORG Lyon  ] decisions , but will likely have to open an investigation itself or designate a judge to investigate the complaint . 
Media reports indicate that requests for [LOC U.S.  ] judicial explanations are likely . 
It is not yet clear how this complaint could affect the [MISC French  ] investigation against the detainees . 
Post will continue to follow the developments of this case closely . 
DJAMEL [PER BEGHAL  ] TRIAL ------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The trial of six men suspected of plotting in [LOC Afghani  ] terror training camps to target [LOC U.S.  ] interests in [LOC France  ] -- specifically , to bomb the [ORG US Embassy  ] in [LOC Paris  ] in 2001 -- began January 3 . 
The proceedings have thus far been dominated by combative responses from the defendants . 
Suspected cell leader [PER Djamel Beghal  ] , a 39-year-old Algerian-born [MISC French  ] citizen who was arrested in the UAE in July 2001 after leaving [LOC Afghanistan  ] , told authorities in [LOC Dubai  ] that he was the head of an al-Qaeda-linked cell intent on attacking [LOC US  ] interests in [LOC France  ] , including the [ORG U.S. Embassy  ] in [LOC Paris  ] ; however , [PER Beghal  ] later retracted his confession and told the chief judge in the trial that he had given it under " methodical torture . 
" In [PER Beghal  ] 's testimony he referred to himself in the third person , responded to the judge 's questions with questions of his own , referred at one point to the proceedings as an " Inquisition court , " and refused to explain his reasons for visiting [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Kamel Daoudi  ] , arrested in [LOC Britain  ] and extradited to [LOC France  ] in September 2001 , posed multiple definitions for the term " jihadist " and proclaimed his innocence as a terrorist , despite being arrested in possession of texts by [MISC Ayman  ] al [MISC Zawahiri  ] and other [MISC Islamic  ] extremists , claiming that " when someone reads 'Das Kapital , ' he is not necessarily a [MISC Marxist  ] . 
" [MISC French  ] authorities allege that [PER Beghal  ] admitted in questioning that [PER Abu Zubaydah  ] gave the order to attack [LOC U.S.  ] interests in an [LOC Afghani  ] terror camp in March 2001 ; both [PER Beghal  ] and [PER Daoudi  ] deny having met [PER Zubaydah  ] . 
The trial is expected to last seven weeks , and if convicted , the six defendants face up to 10 years in prison .
