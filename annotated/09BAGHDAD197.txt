( [ORG S  ] ) In a meeting with Ambassador [PER Satterfield  ] , [PER PMIN  ] and Pol-Mil Couns , [ORG NSA  ] [PER Rubaie  ] said that during his January 19-22 visit to [LOC Tehran  ] he met with President [PER Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  ] , Foreign Minister [PER Manuchehr Motaki  ] , Parliament Speaker [PER Ali Larijani  ] , and [PER Saeed Jalili  ] , secretary of the [ORG Supreme National Security Council  ] . 
In addition , when pressed by Ambassador [PER Satterfield  ] , [PER Rubaie  ] said that [PER Qasem Soleimani  ] , head of the [ORG Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Qods Force  ] , had " stopped by " for a " very short meeting " on January 22 before [PER Rubaie  ] saw [PER Ahmadinejad  ] . 
[PER Rubaie  ] said he believed the [MISC Iranians  ] were ready to make overtures to the new [LOC U.S.  ] administration and were waiting for the right " signs " to respond. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Rubaie  ] said the focus of his presentations to the [MISC Iranian  ] officials was on [LOC Iraq  ] 's new status as a country more " confident " due to the reduction in violence . 
He said he had not heard a harsh reaction to the [ORG GOI  ] decision to sign the [MISC U.S.-Iraq  ] security agreement , instead the [MISC Iranians  ] " were impressed " by what the [ORG GOI  ] had obtained from the [LOC U.S.  ] through effective bargaining . 
In response to a question from Ambassador [PER Satterfield  ] , [PER Rubaie  ] said the subject of a referendum on the security agreement had " not been raised at all " by the [MISC Iranians  ] . 
[PER Rubaie  ] said he had told them that the [ORG GOI  ] intended to monitor the implementation of the security agreement over the next six months to see if it met [ORG GOI  ] expectations. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) On other issues , he said he focused on the dangers of drug trafficking and border problems from [LOC Iran  ] , describing these issues as a threat to [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Regarding the [ORG Mujahedin-e Khalq  ] ( [ORG MeK  ] ) , [PER Rubaie  ] said he had reiterated the [ORG GOI  ] 's position that the [ORG MeK  ] should leave [LOC Iraq  ] , but would not be forcibly expelled . 
He claimed he had not stated as reported in [MISC Iranian  ] press that the [ORG MeK  ] 's [LOC Camp Ashraf  ] would be closed in two months. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Rubaie  ] said the [MISC Iranians  ] had raised the issue of the " [PER Erbil  ] 3 " -- [ORG IRGC  ] officers detained by MNF-I in 2007 who claimed to be in [LOC Iraq  ] as diplomats -- and asked when they would be released . 
[PER Rubaie  ] said he had responded that when MNF-I handed them over to the [ORG GOI  ] , the [ORG GOI  ] would determine whether they faced any [MISC Iraqi  ] judicial charges . 
If not , they Qwhether they faced any [MISC Iraqi  ] judicial charges . 
If not , they would be released . 
Ambassador [PER Satterfield  ] asked if the [MISC Iranians  ] had raised their longstanding request for accreditation of two " diplomats " ( know to the [ORG GoI  ] and [LOC US  ] to be [ORG IRGC  ] officers ) to [MISC Iranian  ] consulates in [LOC Irbil  ] and [LOC Sulaimaniyah  ] . 
[PER Rubaie  ] said the subject did not come up. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In terms of atmospherics , [PER Rubaie  ] said all of his interlocutors had been speaking from the same set of talking points . 
They had all also had a binder of press clippings of statements by [PER Rubaie  ] critical of [LOC Iran  ] going back over the past three years . 
[PER Rubaie  ] had responded that these statements were reactions to [LOC Iran  ] 's continual squeezing of [LOC Iraq  ] . 
In an elaborate metaphor , he said he had told the [MISC Iranians  ] that there is an [MISC Arab  ] proverb that when one steps on someone 's stomach , the victim involuntarily protests by exhaling . 
[PER Soleimani  ] had responded that " [LOC Iran  ] is the mother of all [LOC Shia  ] in the world " and had quoted back a [MISC Koranic  ] proverb that " no matter what one 's parents do , a child should never criticize them . 
" [LOC BAGHDAD  ] 00000197 002 OF 002 <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S/NF ) Separately , [PER Rubaie  ] outlined his goals for the visit in a note to Ambassador [PER Crocker  ] . 
He said that he wanted to demonstrate [LOC Iraq  ] will not be a proxy for anyone , build a cooperative relationship with [LOC Iran  ] , explain [ORG GoI MeK  ] policy , express the advantages to [LOC Iran  ] of a stable [LOC Iraq  ] , and explain the advantages to [LOC Iraq  ] and its neighbors of the " [MISC Withdrawal Agreement  ] . 
" Among his planned talking points were concerns about the discovery of [MISC Iranian-made  ] weapons and ammunition used against [MISC Iraqis  ] and [MISC Americans  ] , while noting that " the rate of this has been much lower in recent weeks than in the past . 
" ( NOTE: Shortly before [PER Rubaie  ] departed for [LOC Iran  ] , MNF-I intelligence officers briefed him about recently discovered [MISC Iranian  ] munitions in [LOC Iraq  ] that were apparently manufactured as recently as 2008 . 
) <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Comment: In contrast to [PER Rubaie  ] 's tough-talking descriptions of the [LOC Tehran  ] meetings , press accounts portrayed the visit as a warm affirmation of [MISC Iraqi-Iranian  ] relations . 
Both depictions are self-serving ; the truth is likely somewhere in the middle . 
But [PER Rubaie  ] 's description of [MISC Iranian  ] acquiescence to the [ORG Security Agreement  ] is consistent with reports of PM [PER Maliki  ] 's visit to [LOC Tehran  ] this month ( reftel ) and other indications that the [MISC Iranians  ] are treating visiting [MISC Iraqi  ] officials with increasing degrees of respect . 
The [MISC Iranians  ] haven't publicly objected to the [MISC Security Agreement  ] and may be hopeful that we are going to withdraw relatively quickly .
