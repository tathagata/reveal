Please see paragraphs 4-7 . 
OBJECTIVES ---------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC S/Rel  ] to [LOC Ukraine  ] ) For Embassy [LOC Kyiv  ] , please approach host-country officials to pursue the objectives set out below . 
In discussing these points , please emphasize that at this stage we are only gathering information , including the views of interested parties . 
While we believe it is extremely important to ensure the cargo of the [ORG FAINA  ] is not offloaded in [LOC Somalia  ] , we are eager to consult with the flag and crew states prior to taking action to prevent that scenario . 
Our contact is therefore meant to inform our decisions about how to proceed in this matter . 
-- Convey the United [MISC States'  ] sympathy and concern for the safety and well-being of the crew member nationals on board the [ORG FAINA  ] . 
-- Explain that the nature of the vessel 's cargo and its potential diversion by terrorists pose a grave threat to security in the region . 
-- Note that among the available options for preventing this scenario would be to disable and/or board the vessel . 
-- Ask for [LOC Ukraine  ] 's views with respect to possible [LOC United States  ] military action to prevent the hijackers from delivering the [ORG FAINA  ] 's cargo into [LOC Somalia  ] . 
Such intervention could include disabling fire against the vessel or equipment being used to offload ( " lighterage " ) it , or boarding the vessel . 
Emphasize that we would only consider such actions as a last resort to prevent the cargo from being taken ashore by the pirates or other malafides . 
If the pirates simply hold the vessel for ransom , as they have in the past , we would not intervene in this manner . 
Thus , we are consulting with [LOC Ukraine  ] now regarding the possible range of options open to us . 
-- Note , however , that the [LOC United States  ] reserves the right to take urgent action if necessary . 
-- We are of course aware that the opposed boarding of any vessel creates a risk to the lives of the crewmembers , so we are especially interested in [LOC Ukraine  ] 's views regarding such measures , should that situation arise . 
-- Request information on the ship specifications , including draft . 
-- Inquire into host nation 's authorities , willingness , and ability to assist the [LOC U.S.  ] in bringing the pirates aboard the [ORG FAINA  ] to justice consistent with [ORG UN Security Council Resolution  ] 1816 . 
Seek information on any conditions precedent or particular procedural requirements that would enable the host government to accept custody of , investigate , and prosecute any persons apprehended in conjunction with the piracy of the [ORG FAINA.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 .
