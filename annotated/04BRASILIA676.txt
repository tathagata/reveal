REASONS: 1.5 ( b ) ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary . 
On 19 March Ambassdor , accompanied by PolCouns , met with [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] Under Secretary for Political Affairs [PER Vera Pedrosa  ] to deliver demarches requesting immediate contributions to the Hait MIF ( ref B ) , and soliciting [LOC Brazil  ] 's support for [ORG USG  ] plans and goals for building a democratic and prosperous [LOC Iraq  ] ( ref A ) . 
Ambassador also took the opportunity to discuss cooperation with [LOC Brazil  ] in the [ORG UN Committee  ] on [ORG Human Rights  ] ( refs C and D ) . 
On [LOC Haiti  ] , [PER Pedrosa  ] responded that operational and budgetary challenges , the need for congressional approval and [ORG GOB  ] concerns about operations under a [ORG Chapter  ] 7 mandate all make an immediate [MISC Brazilian  ] deployment unlikely . 
Longer term , the issue of a [ORG Chapter  ] 7 v. [ORG Chapter  ] 6 mandate for the follow-on stabilization force would need to be considered , but may be " manageable " so long as there continues to be strong [ORG GOB  ] political will to participate , she said . 
[PER Pedrosa  ] said [LOC Brazil  ] has not offered , and is not encouraging a request , for provision in [LOC Brazil  ] of asylum to [PER Aristide  ] . 
On [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] is considering reopening its embassy , but still evaluating the security environment . 
In the [ORG UNCHR  ] , [PER Pedrosa  ] said she hoped the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] will find issues for cooperation , but noted that [LOC Brazil  ] 's delegation has already been instructed to abstain on any [LOC Cuba  ] resolution . 
Key points follow below . 
End summary . 
[LOC HAITI  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In the absence of Foreign Minister [PER Amorim  ] ( on his way to [LOC China  ] ) Ambassador provided [PER Pedrosa  ] with a [MISC Portuguese  ] language paper containing ref B points , and explained there is an urgent need for additional forces now if the MIF is to secure and stabilize areas of the country beyond the capital . 
Ambassador also welcomed the arrival in [LOC Haiti  ] on 19 March of a [MISC Brazilian  ] military fact-finding mission , encouraged deployment of a [MISC Brazilian  ] liaison officer to the [ORG U.S. Southern Command  ] as soon as possible , and reiterated [ORG SOUTHCOM  ] 's willingness to try to provide as much operational support as possible for [LOC Brazil  ] 's deployment to [LOC Haiti  ] , especially if that could facilitate a positive [ORG GOB  ] response to ref B request. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Pedrosa  ] responded that [LOC Brazil  ] continues to plan for participation in a stabilization mission following the 90-day [ORG MIF  ] period established by [ORG UNSCR  ] 1529 . 
However , she expressed doubts that [LOC Brazil  ] could move sooner in making an immediate deployment because ( 1 ) [LOC Brazil  ] 's congress must approve any deployment of forces , ( 2 ) the operational planning and budgetary issues confronting the [ORG GOB  ] are challenging and will take time to work through . 
She noted particularly that the [ORG GOB  ] formula for reimbursing its soldiers for PKO missions is extremely expensive for the national government , hence extensive consultations are necessary with the planning ministry , as well as congress , before moving ahead with a large-scale deployment of forces. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) PolCouns asked [PER Pedrosa  ] and MRE [LOC North America Division Chief  ] [PER Washington Pereira  ] ( also present in the meeting ) whether the [ORG MIF  ] 's current mandate under [ORG Chapter  ] 7 ( as opposed to [ORG Chapter  ] 6 ) would be a problem for an immediate [MISC Brazilian  ] deployment now , and whether it would continue to be a problem if the [ORG UN  ] maintains a [ORG Chapter  ] 7 mandate in [LOC Haiti  ] for the follow-on force . 
[PER Pedrosa  ] said the [ORG GOB  ] has traditionally interpreted [LOC Brazil  ] 's constitution as permitting [MISC Brazilian  ] forces to participate only in [ORG Chapter  ] 6 peace-keeping ( as opposed to [ORG Chapter  ] 7 peace-enforcement ) missions . 
Hence for both an immediate deployment and for participation in the follow-on mission , this would be a serious issue for the [ORG GOB  ] ( and potentially its congress ) to deliberate . 
However , [PER Pedrosa  ] and [PER Washington Pereira  ] did note that there is strong [ORG GOB  ] interest in participating in [LOC Haiti  ] , hence a [ORG Chapter  ] 6-7 dilemma , should one arise in the context of the follow-on deployment , may be " manageable , " so long as there continues to be [ORG GOB  ] political will to support participation. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Ambassador asked whether [PER Pedrosa  ] could comment on some reports that [PER Aristide  ] may seek asylum in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[PER Pedrosa  ] responded that [LOC Brazil  ] had neither offered nor received a request in this regard , and she opined that the [ORG GOB  ] would be unlikely to view the idea " with enthusiasm " should a request be made . 
[LOC IRAQ  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Ambassador provided ref A paper , with a [MISC Portuguese  ] summary , to [PER Pedrosa  ] , and indicated the [ORG USG  ] is seeking general support for reftel plans and goals , as opposed to specific actions . 
She noted that she understood [LOC Brazil  ] is considering reopening its embassy in [LOC Iraq  ] , and that there are many [MISC Brazilian  ] companies with long experience and strong interest in [LOC Iraq.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Pedrosa  ] indicated she would study ref A paper carefully , and confirmed that the [ORG GOB  ] is considering reopening its mission in [LOC Iraq  ] , but continues to study carefully the security situation on the ground . 
[ORG UNCHR  ] Issues <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Turning to [ORG UNCHR  ] issues , Ambassador provided [PER Pedrosa  ] with papers containing a number of points on [ORG USG  ] perspectives on [ORG CHR  ] cooperation with [ORG GRULAC  ] and on a range of other issues , noting the points had been provided by the Embassy in earlier demarches to the MRE human rights division , and that we looked forward to further reactions ( refs C and D ) . 
She also asked whether [PER Pedrosa  ] wished to outline some of the [ORG GOB  ] 's priorities for the [ORG UNCHR  ] . 
[PER Pedrosa  ] expressed the hope that the [ORG USG  ] and [ORG GOB  ] could work together on issues where their perspectives are similar , though some divergence would be inevitable. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) On the issue of [LOC Cuba  ] , [PER Pedrosa  ] indicated that the [ORG GOB  ] delegation to the [ORG CHR  ] had already been instructed to abstain on any single-country resolution , based on " our customary reasons . 
" She said that a quiet dialogue on human rights with [PER Castro  ] is [LOC Brazil  ] 's preferred method to try to effect improvements. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Ambassador responded that , at a minimum , it would be helpful if the [ORG GOB  ] could encourage [LOC Cuba  ] to accept a [ORG UN  ] special rapporteur mission , and she asked whether the [ORG GOB  ] believed its quiet diplomacy is producing results . 
[PER Pedrosa  ] said the decision to accept [ORG UN  ] rapporteurs should be made by national governments for their own reasons , as [LOC Brazil  ] had done . 
Neither she nor [PER Washington Pereira  ] could offer examples of positive developments on human rights in [LOC Cuba  ] , but [PER Pedrosa  ] noted that a new generation of [MISC Cubans  ] -- both in [LOC Cuba  ] and in [LOC Miami  ] -- offer hope for a peaceful evolution on the island .
