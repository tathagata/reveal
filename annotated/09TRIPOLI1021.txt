REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: [ORG Human Right Watch  ] 's December 12 launch of its latest report on [LOC Libya  ] -- the first such launch in-country -- provided an unprecedented public forum for discussion of [LOC Libya  ] 's past abuses . 
The event degenerated into a shouting match between regime critics and supporters , some of which appears to have been scripted . 
[ORG HRW  ] officials credited [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi as key to the event , stating that his personal involvement prompted them to move them the event from [LOC Cairo  ] and enabled the families of several victims of the [MISC Qadhafi  ] regime 's abuses to travel from [LOC Benghazi  ] to the event . 
[ORG HRW  ] told us privately that Justice Secretary [PER Mustafa Abduljalil  ] is a proponent of rule of law , and urged the [ORG USG  ] to provide technical support for [LOC Libya  ] 's new draft criminal code , for which [ORG HRW  ] already has provided 30 pages of comments . 
We believe this proposal is worthy of further consideration , particularly under the auspices of our bilateral [ORG Human Rights Dialogue  ] . 
End Summary . 
2 . 
( C ) Representatives from [ORG Human Rights Watch  ] ( [ORG HRW  ] ) credited members of the [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] ( [ORG QDF  ] ) for the latter 's " brave and risky " facilitation of an event in [LOC Tripoli  ] launching the rights group 's first comprehensive report on [LOC Libya  ] since 2006 . 
The December 12 press conference brought members of the [MISC Libyan  ] and international press together with relatives of past victims of [MISC Libyan  ] human rights abuses -- and members of [LOC Libya  ] 's powerful security forces . 
While [ORG HRW  ] staff recognized the historical and political significance of launching the report from [LOC Tripoli  ] , they were careful not to overstate its importance or make assumptions on what it would mean for resolving outstanding human rights issues . 
[PER Tom Malinowski  ] , director of [ORG HRW  ] 's [LOC Washington  ] office , told [PER Poloff  ] that the [ORG QDF  ] 's release of a similar report on December 10 was likely designed to reduce the sting of [ORG HRW  ] 's report by giving a national voice to human rights recommendations . 
Despite [PER Saif  ] al-Islam 's positive intervention , authorities detained at least five families of the 1996 [LOC Abu Salim  ] prison riot on their way from [LOC Benghazi  ] to the event and denied visas for [ORG Washington Post  ] and [ORG New York Times  ] journalists to attend the [ORG HRW  ] 's press conference . 
3 . 
( S//NF ) A phone call from [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] 's staff putting [ORG HRW  ] on notice for a possible audience with the [MISC Libyan  ] leader thirty minutes before the scheduled start of the press conference nearly caused a last-minute cancellation , but the event began with only minor technical complications . 
The crowd was twice as large as [ORG HRW  ] expected , with approximately 80 journalists , diplomats , and government critics in the room . 
At least four security agents took notes , photos , and film of the proceedings ; the primary cameraman had served as poloff 's assigned surveillant for nearly six months . 
[ORG HRW  ] briefly outlined its report , citing improvements on freedom of expression and the increased willingness of some public officials to accept and act on criticism . 
They acknowledged that many of [LOC Libya  ] 's major cases stem from events many years old , but that their concerns related to those cases would remain until victims and their relatives were given full accounts of and received justice for past violations . 
Thanking the [ORG QDF  ] for its facilitation of both their study tour in April and the in-country launch of the report -- a fact that put [LOC Libya  ] ahead of many other [MISC Arab  ] states -- they also took so-called reformers to task for not doing enough to codify and institutionalize progress on human rights that has so far been won with support from [PER Saif  ] al-Islam and members of his inner circle . 
4 . 
( C ) The short briefing and recommendations were followed by a lively question-and-answer segment that quickly degenerated into a litany of grievances against the [ORG Internal Security Organization  ] ( [ORG ISO  ] ) for years of repression . 
A family member of a victim of the [LOC Abu Salim  ] riot , holding a photo of his dead brother , described his brother 's case in detail claiming the family had taken food and clothing to the prison for 13 years , until they received a death certificate this spring that lacked a cause of death . 
A woman from [LOC Benghazi  ] asked whether [ORG HRW  ] would apply pressure on the GOL to prosecute the director of an orphanage accused of sexually abusing girls under his care . 
Journalists and security agents swarmed those who spoke , some of whom were flanked by known employees of the [ORG QDF  ] . 
5 . 
( C ) After several longer testimonies , a journalist from state news agency [ORG JANA  ] spoke , claiming to have accepted government compensation for his brother 's death at [LOC Abu Salim  ] . 
He railed against [ORG HRW  ] and those continuing to petition the government for justice on past abuses as " anti-Libyan " and denounced [ORG HRW  ] for [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00001021 002 OF 003 holding [LOC Libya  ] to different standards than the rest of the world . 
He asked how [ORG HRW  ] 's report could even be written when abuses like " the war in [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Abu Ghraib  ] , and [MISC Guantanamo  ] " went unpunished . 
He defended [LOC Libya  ] 's actions as necessary to keep the country safe , and noted that no attacks like 9/11 could occur on [MISC Libyan  ] soil due to these protections . 
[ORG HRW  ] reiterated its non-governmental and politically neutral status , and pointed out that it had been the first organization to report on alleged abuses at [LOC Abu Ghraib  ] . 
While [ORG HRW  ] 's explanation appeared to calm some in the audience , his statements ended what appeared to be a carefully scripted piece of theater . 
The next speakers , only some of whom seemed to be at the event at the invitation of the [ORG QDF  ] , made more vocal complaints on the deaths or disappearances of relatives and made specific claims against the [ORG ISO  ] . 
6 . 
( C ) The event quickly evolved into an angry shouting match between government supporters and a sizable group of [MISC Libyan  ] citizens urging the creation of compensation and truth commissions . 
The pro-government crowd , taunted by members of the audience as [ORG ISO  ] agents , verbally attacked the [ORG HRW  ] and their detractors , causing several individuals from both sides to storm out . 
After this public catharsis had endured for over 90 minutes and with no further questions about the content of the report , [ORG HRW  ] ended the press conference and spoke individually with several government critics . 
( Notably , the actual events differed from a [ORG Times of London  ] report , which exaggerated the details of the role of GOL security officials in " shutting down " the press conference . 
) Watching from the parking lot , emboffs observed several of the most vocal government critics entering a large van with staff from the [ORG QDF  ] unhindered by security agents . 
Others , including a lawyer claiming to have represented [PER Idriss Bufayed  ] , departed individually without apparent incident . 
7 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) In a December 13 meeting , [ORG HRW  ] staff told the Ambassador that [PER Saif  ] al-Islam had personally intervened to allow the group to launch the report from [LOC Tripoli  ] and that his influence had led to unprecedented access and openness from both high-ranking [MISC Libyan  ] officials and ordinary citizens . 
[ORG HRW  ] moved the planned launch from [LOC Cairo  ] to [LOC Tripoli  ] in mid-November at [PER Saif  ] al-Islam 's encouragement , and the [ORG QDF  ] facilitated meetings and visas for [ORG HRW  ] . 
Contrasting their experience with their first visit in 2005 , they remarked that everyone from lawyers to [ORG ISO  ] director [PER al-Tuhamy Khalid  ] spoke more freely about [LOC Libya  ] 's human rights culture and no longer " cited chapter and verse of the [ORG Green Book  ] . 
" [PER Malinowski  ] assessed that a stalemate between " law-and-order " officials like Justice Secretary [PER Mustafa Abduljalil  ] and security officials like [PER Khalid  ] would make further progress on human rights difficult . 
Recounting a two-hour " philosophical debate " with [PER Khalid  ] , [PER Malinowski  ] said the [ORG ISO  ] Chief recognized he was operating his organization outside the law by holding some 330 prisoners who had been acquitted or served their sentences , but justified his inaction on the grounds of national security and [LOC Libya  ] 's fight against terror . 
[PER Khalid  ] ended his meeting with [ORG HRW  ] by telling them , " There are some criminals who don't deserve human rights . 
Other than that you and I agree on everything . 
" 8 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) [ORG HRW  ] recommended that the [LOC U.S.  ] support those elements of [MISC Libyan  ] society that sought to institutionalize human rights protections . 
They see [PER Abduljalil  ] as a proud nationalist who believes in the principles of justice and the primacy of law and chalks up [LOC Libya  ] 's fitful march toward human rights legitimacy as " birthing pains " of a nation that is just reentering international society . 
[PER Abduljalil  ] told [ORG HRW  ] that he would continue to fight against the culture of corruption that allowed security services to operate above the law . 
[ORG HRW  ] sees the draft criminal code -- written under the [ORG QDF  ] umbrella -- as a key , yet still insufficient part , of institutionalizing human rights protections within the [MISC Libyan  ] legal structure . 
They provided post and the [ORG QDF  ] with 30 pages of recommendations on the draft law -- which has been circulating for at least three years -- that would bring [LOC Libya  ] 's penal code in line with international human rights norms , and suggested that [LOC U.S.  ] technical experts play a role in finalizing the draft code , through the provision of technical assistance . 
While they recognize that change will come slowly in [LOC Libya  ] 's security organizations , [ORG HRW  ] said that [LOC U.S.  ] security officials might be able to deliver messages to the [ORG ESO  ] and [ORG ISO  ] on the long-term ( in ) effectiveness of aggressive detention and questioning policies . 
To help insulate [LOC Libya  ] 's fledgling progress from the whims of its personality-driven political system , [ORG HRW  ] advised that enshrining human rights [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00001021 003 OF 003 protections into the law and its application will be fundamental to real societal change . 
9 . 
( C ) [ORG Comment: Press  ] reports on the tensions between security officers and regime critics at the [ORG HRW  ] launch event were overstated . 
Most of the proceedings , including some of the back-and-forth between victims' families and security officials , seemed to follow a script that exalted the work of [PER Saif  ] al-Islam but remained carefully within the " red lines " that would cause significant offense . 
Although known security agents photographed and videotaped the event , and some families were detained for a short time and ordered not to travel from [LOC Benghazi  ] to [LOC Tripoli  ] , there are no reports that security officials took punitive action against regime critics. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Comment continued: This event -- the first-ever of its kind in [LOC Libya  ] -- helped solidify [PER Saif  ] al-Islam 's reputation as a " reformer " and also undoubtedly pushed the envelope with some Old Guard elements . 
The draft criminal code strikes us as an interesting opportunity for real reform in [LOC Libya  ] . 
It is encouraging that the [MISC Libyan  ] Government is engaged in a dialogue with [ORG HRW  ] on the specifics of the draft legislation , and we believe that [ORG HRW  ] 's suggestion that the [ORG USG  ] consider providing technical assistance merits further review . 
The draft criminal code , including our providing the background to [LOC U.S.  ] jurisprudence handling of free speech , assembly , and criticism of public officials , could be good topics of discussion for the working groups that will be convened under the auspices of our [ORG Human Rights Dialogue  ] .
