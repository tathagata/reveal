( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] The cost of the [MISC Dutch  ] deployment in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and probems related to the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] reoganization -- coupled with negotiations on defene issues during coalition formation talks of the nw [MISC Dutch  ] government -- could jeopardize several key projects for the 2007 defense budget . 
While " " al options are still on the table , " " possible projct options include postponing or withdrawing fro the [ORG NATO  ] C-17 [ORG Strategic Airlift Initiative  ] , as ell as new [LOC Chinook  ] helicopter , Tactical Tomahawk ( [ORG TACTOM  ] ) missile , and unmanned aerial vehicle ( UAVs acquisition . 
Defense Minister [PER Henk Kamp  ] and MODState Secretary [PER Cees van der Knaap  ] will discuss ptions January 16 . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG MOD  ] conacts tell us the rising cost of the [MISC Dutch  ] deployment to [LOC Afghanistan  ] -- already half a billion euros - is severely restricting [MISC Dutch  ] defense investmets . 
A number of defense projects slated for 200 and 2008 are likely to be cut or delayed as a rsult . 
In addition , an on-going defense ministry reorganization is compounding the problem . 
Previously , [MISC Dutch  ] services jealously guarded their own budgets . 
With the reorganization , the army , navy and air force for the first time are working from a combined budget -- oversight has been lax . 
As a result , project costs have run higher than anticipated . 
[ORG MOD  ] Director of General Policy Affairs [PER Lo Casteleijn  ] told Charge January 12 that the [ORG GONL  ] often funds projects up to 130 percent in case of cost overruns -- in this case , most 2006 projects are running at about 120-130 percent , which is cutting into 2007 project financing. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG MOD  ] contacts stressed " " all options are still on the table " " regarding defense-related projects . 
[LOC DM Kamp  ] and [ORG MOD  ] State Secretary van der [PER Knaap  ] will discuss various options on January 16 , and shortly thereafter send a letter to Parliament presenting the " " finalized " " budget . 
[PER Kamp  ] will then appear before the parliamentary [ORG Defense Committee  ] for further discussion . 
Major projects include: -- [ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] ( [ORG JSF  ] ) : The [ORG GONL  ] initially expressed interest in purchasing three early [ORG JSF  ] aircraft in order to participate in the test and evaluation phase . 
[ORG MOD  ] contacts suggest the [MISC Dutch  ] will now purchase two -- which still qualifies them for the test and evaluation program . 
[PER Casteleijn  ] told Charge January 11 that [ORG JSF  ] will be a topic of coalition formation talks , especially as the [ORG Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) opposes [ORG JSF  ] program participation . 
[PER Casteleijn  ] said the [MISC Christian Democrats  ] ( [ORG CDA  ] ) and [ORG PvdA  ] need to " " define the boundaries " " for discussion on [ORG JSF  ] . 
He suggested program participation will remain intact while the number of aircraft purchased will become a topic of negotiation . 
[PER Casteleijn  ] also expected [ORG PvdA  ] to push for an independent , non-partisan review of [ORG JSF  ] to determine whether it is the " " best plane for the best price . 
" " -- [ORG NATO  ] C-17 [ORG Strategic Airlift Initiative: MOD  ] and defense consultant contacts note the price for " " leasing " " [MISC C-17s  ] per hour has nearly doubled from earlier estimates , while [ORG Boeing  ] insists participating [ORG NATO  ] allies purchase planes in advance to leasing them -- this may force the [MISC Dutch  ] to withdraw from the initiative . 
[PER Casteleijn  ] expressed disappointment over the revised terms of reference , and confirmed that the [MISC Dutch  ] delegation at [ORG NATO  ] has received instructions to push back -- if the initial terms are not possible , then the [MISC Dutch  ] will have to pull out . 
He said strategic airlift remains a priority -- he would not be surprised if the number of [ORG JSF  ] aircraft acquired was reduced to support [MISC C-130  ] or C-17 acquisition . 
-- [ORG CH-47 Chinook  ] [MISC Helicopters:  ] The [MISC Dutch  ] are relying heavily on their [MISC Chinooks  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and have requested six new [MISC Chinooks  ] with specialized -- and expensive -- [ORG Honeywell  ] cockpits in addition to refurbishing the rest of their [LOC Chinook  ] fleet . 
While postponing the new [LOC Chinook  ] acquisition is a possibility , [ORG MOD  ] and defense consultant contacts say the [ORG MOD  ] leadership is ready to go ahead with the purchase . 
Refurbishing the fleet will most likely be delayed . 
-- Tactical Tomahawk ( [ORG TACTOM  ] ) missiles: [ORG TACTOM  ] was considered a key part of [PER DM Kamp  ] 's plan to improve the [MISC Dutch  ] navy ; equipped with [ORG TACTOM  ] , the relatively new [MISC Dutch  ] LCF frigates would become a force to be reckoned with . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG MOD  ] had received parliamentary support to become the third country after the [LOC United States  ] and the [LOC UK  ] to acquire [ORG TACTOM  ] . 
However , [ORG PvdA  ] vociferously opposed [ORG TACTOM  ] acquisition , while the [ORG GONL  ] was panned in the [MISC Dutch  ] press for attempting to acquire a weapon viewed as " " aggressive and offensive " " in nature . 
[ORG MOD  ] Deputy Director for General Policy Affairs Jan [PER Geerts Siccama  ] told polmiloff January 5 that while DM [PER Kamp  ] may continue to push [ORG TACTOM  ] , he would not be surprised if the almost USD 60 million acquisition becomes a casualty of coalition formation talks with [ORG PvdA  ] . 
[PER Casteleijn  ] agreed ; he believed [ORG TACTOM  ] was " " dead " " . 
-- [ORG Unmanned Aerial Vehicles  ] ( UAVs ) : The [MISC Dutch  ] have informally walked away from their MALE UAV program with the [MISC French  ] , and expressed keen interest in the [LOC U.S.  ] Predator B UAV program . 
However , [ORG MOD  ] working level and defense consultant contacts suggest pursuit of Predator B will be suspended indefinitely due to financial constraints . 
[PER Casteleijn  ] noted that UAV is " " still on the agenda , " " but funding it in 2007 will be difficult given budget constraints . 
Comment ------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [MISC Dutch  ] pride themselves on " " doing more " " with a limited defense budget . 
While [MISC Dutch  ] spending on defense as a percentage of GDP is well below [ORG NATO  ] 's two percent target , the [MISC Dutch  ] have invested generously -- over 20 percent of its defense budget -- on new defense-related projects in recent years . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] are now over-committed and looking to prioritize ongoing operations and big ticket acquisitions with smaller investments -- while keeping [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [ORG JSF  ] at the top of the list . 
The Ambassador will engage further with CHOD Gen. Berlijn and senior [ORG MOD  ] leadership next week .
