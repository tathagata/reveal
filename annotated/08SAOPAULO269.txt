( U ) SUMMARY: Soaring petroleum prices and a rapidly growing domestic fleet of flex-fuel cars are driving double-digit expansion in ethanol production in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
In the coming year alone , [LOC Brazil  ] 's production of sugarcane-based ethanol is projected to increase 14.8 percent . 
Domestic demand for ethanol is large and growing , currently consuming 85 percent of all production . 
The other 15 percent is exported , primarily to the [LOC United States  ] . 
The ethanol private sector in [LOC Brazil  ] is increasingly partnering with international companies in building production facilities , both in and out of [LOC Brazil  ] , as well as addressing the internal logistics problems that undermine the potential profitability of [MISC Brazilian  ] ethanol exports . 
Infrastructure bottlenecks in [LOC Brazil  ] , as well as various international tariff regimes , will likely continue to pose hurdles to the expansion of [MISC Brazilian  ] ethanol exports and the internationalization of ethanol as a commodity . 
END SUMMARY. --------------------------------------------- ------ DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH IN SUGAR AND ETHANOL PRODUCTION --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) According to the [ORG USDA  ] 's [ORG Agricultural Trade Office  ] in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] ( [ORG ATO  ] ) , both sugar and ethanol production is expected to increase during the current market year ( [LOC MY  ] ) corresponding to May 2008 to April 2009 . 
During this period , land dedicated to sugarcane cultivation is projected to expand by 12 percent from 7.19 million hectares to 8.05 million , equivalent to approximately 2.3 percent of [LOC Brazil  ] 's arable land . 
An increasing percentage of that sugarcane is projected to go towards ethanol production instead of sugar ( 56.5 percent in [LOC MY  ] 2008/2009 vice 54.5 percent in [LOC MY  ] 2007/2008 ) . 
In absolute terms , ethanol production for [LOC MY  ] 2008/2009 is projected to see a 14.8 percent increase ( 25.71 billion liters vice 22.39 ) . 
( Note: Sugarcane is currently the sole feedstock for ethanol in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Much of [LOC Brazil  ] 's ethanol production continues to be destined for the domestic market , with domestic demand expected to rise 16.2 percent in [LOC MY  ] 2008/2009 ( 22.05 billion liters vice 18.97 ) . 
The expanding fleet of flex fuel vehicles , which today account for 90 percent of new car sales , explains the expanding domestic demand ( Ref A ) . 
In the month of April , for the first time in 20 years , sales of ethanol surpassed gasoline in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Largely due to fuel demand , in 2007 , sugar and its derivatives passed hydro power as the second largest source of energy in [LOC Brazil  ] , contributing 16 percent of [LOC Brazil  ] 's overall energy matrix ( compared to petroleum at 36.7 percent and hydro at 14.7 percent ) . 
In 2007 , bioelectricity accounted for three percent of [LOC Brazil  ] 's electricity ( 1,400 megawatts ) . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] Sugarcane [ORG Industry Association  ] ( [ORG UNICA  ] ) predicts that given the proper government incentives to tie into the main power grid , this number could increase to 11,500 megawatts by 2015 and 14,400 megawatts by 2021 - equivilant to 20 percent of [LOC Brazil  ] 's electricity usage today. --------------------------------- ETHANOL EXPORTS: PRESENT & FUTURE --------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) For over thirty years , [LOC Brazil  ] has been by far the world 's largest producer of ethanol from sugarcane . 
Correspondingly , it has been and remains today the world 's largest exporter of ethanol . 
According to the [MISC Brazilian  ] Secretariat of [ORG Foreign Trade  ] ( [ORG SECEX  ] ) , major export markets for 2007 included the [LOC U.S  ] . 
( 841 million liters ) , [LOC Holland  ] ( 793 million liters ) and [LOC Japan  ] ( 363 million liters ) . 
Exports to [LOC Caribbean  ] and [ORG Central American  ] countries [ORG SAO PAULO  ] 00000269 002 OF 004 ( [LOC Jamaica  ] , [LOC Costa Rica  ] , [LOC El Salvador  ] and [LOC Trinidad  ] & [LOC Tobago  ] ) amounted to 910 million liters . 
Virtually all of this volume was then re-exported to the [LOC United States  ] under the [ORG Caribbean Basin Initiative  ] ( [ORG CBI  ] ) and [MISC CAFTA-DR  ] tariff concessions after going through the process of dehydration . 
( Note: These numbers are inconsistent with [LOC U.S.  ] census data that shows ethanol imports from [LOC Brazil  ] of 714 million liters in 2007 .

) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Despite the negative perceptions in some international quarters about the role of biofuels in contributing to food inflation ( Ref B ) , concerns about the environmental impact of ethanol production , and allegations of precarious working conditions of sugarcane workers ( septel ) - [MISC Brazilian  ] sugar and ethanol producers see growth potential in the export market , apart from the rising domestic demand . 
[ORG ATO  ] projects that [LOC Brazil  ] will export 3.9 billion liters in [LOC MY  ] 2008/2009 , a 13 percent increase over [LOC MY  ] 2007/2008 . 
Other interlocutors also see high oil prices further supporting ethanol exports to the [LOC U.S.  ] - both direct and through the [ORG CBI  ] countries . 
The [LOC Brazil  ] Renewable Energy Company ( [ORG Brenco  ] ) told Econoff that conservative analysts believe ethanol will remain competitive in the international market vis-`-vis gasoline at least as long as petroleum costs exceed USD 70 to 80 per barrel. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) [MISC Brazilian  ] exporters believe there is significant international market potential in the blending of ethanol with gasoline , particularly the [MISC E10  ] blend ( 90 percent gasoline and 10 percent ethanol ) and possibly as much as E25 ( 75 percent gasoline and 25 percent ethanol ) . 
[ORG Brenco  ] is largely basing their business model on exporting ethanol as a partial fuel substitute . 
Even in countries that do not have a significant number of flex-fuel cars , ethanol can be blended up to a certain level with gasoline and run in standard gasoline engines without the need to overhaul the downstream infrastructure or modify vehicle engines. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Brazilian  ] industry experts are concentrating particularly on the [LOC U.S.  ] market , largely because they believe that the [LOC U.S.  ] will not be able to reach [ORG Congressional  ] and Executive branch mandates for ethanol or biodiesel production of 36 billion gallons by 2022 . 
According to [PER Plinio Nastari  ] ( editor of the leading ethanol industry newsletter ) , and [PER Roberto Gianetti  ] da [PER Fonseca  ] ( associated with Ethanol Trading SA and the [ORG Federation of Industries  ] of the State of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , [ORG FIESP  ] ) , [LOC U.S.  ] domestic production will peak at 15 billion gallons given current technology . 
Some [MISC Brazilian  ] ethanol exporters , and especially [PER Gianetti  ] da [PER Fonseca  ] , argue for a change in [LOC U.S.  ] policy that would allow for tariff-free access to the [LOC U.S.  ] market for E85 blends to fuel the growing [LOC U.S.  ] fleet of flex fuel vehicles . 
( Comment: While most ConGen contacts are critical of the ethanol tariff , the sentiment is not universal . 
[PER Miguel Dabdoub  ] , coordinator for the [ORG Biodiesel Brazil Project  ] out of the [ORG University of Sao Paulo  ] 's [ORG Laboratory for Clean Technology Development  ] , argues that the tariff is necessary for a period of time as a mechanism to build up domestic support among the [LOC U.S.  ] population and as part of a larger strategy to make ethanol an acceptable alternative globally . 
Interlocutors at [ORG FIESP  ] have also stated that an immediate removal of the tariff would hurt supply in [LOC Brazil  ] as more companies would seek to immediately export to the [LOC U.S.  ] Similarly , while many interlocutors at [LOC MRE  ] and in [ORG Congress  ] urge the immediate removal of the tariff , the [ORG Ministry of Agriculture  ] does not urge this point .

( U ) Like in most other sectors of the [MISC Brazilian  ] economy , the [ORG SAO PAULO  ] 00000269 003 OF 004 ethanol industry suffers from inadequate infrastructure , the so-called 'Custo Brasil' - costs other than those related to production which significantly increase total cost and affect competitiveness . 
Custo Brasil is seen along the ethanol production line - from storage to transportation to port handling - and represents an on-going bottleneck in increasing [MISC Brazilian  ] ethanol exports . 
Starting in the countryside at sugar distilleries , ethanol destined for domestic consumption moves by truck ( only occasionally by rail or pipeline ) to regional distribution centers , then onward to secondary distribution centers , and finally to gas stations . 
Ethanol producers hold stocks at the distributors' convenience , thus imposing storage costs on mills . 
Many of the roads utilized to transport ethanol , especially secondary or local roads , are in poor condition . 
Highways in the main producing areas are often very good , but tolls are expensive . 
Most of the existing sugar-ethanol transportation routes are essentially unchanged from twenty years ago . 
According to calculations of [PER Weber Amaral  ] of the [MISC Brazilian  ] Center for [MISC Biofuels  ] , internal logistics account for 35 percent of ethanol 's total cost. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) Ethanol destined for export faces additional bottlenecks upon reaching port . 
There is a limited amount of port storage dedicated to ethanol , forcing exporters to rent space in multi-use chemical terminals . 
This limitation of storage capacity represents a significant restraining factor on any increases in ethanol exports . 
The same obstacle exists in the contracting of vessels . 
As there is no well-developed large scale international market for ethanol , exporters rely on multi-use chemical tankers . 
This involves substantial additional costs since storage facilities and tanks must be bid away from other potential users , and be thoroughly cleaned before and after use. --------------- INDUSTRY TRENDS --------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) These existing obstacles do not seem likely to discourage expansion in the sector as [LOC Brazil  ] still produces the cheapest ethanol in the world ( 22 cents a liter compared to 30 cents for [LOC U.S.  ] corn-based and 53 cents for [MISC European  ] beetroot ethanol ) . 
Several major private sector initiatives aim to substantially increase [LOC Brazil  ] 's export capacity and reduce transportation costs . 
[ORG Brenco  ] outlined to Econoffs a plan to vertically integrate the entire process in order to control their costs and get their product to market. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) [ORG COSAN  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] 's biggest sugar and ethanol producer , recently announced USD 826 million-deal with [ORG Esso  ] ( [ORG Exxon Mobil Corp  ] . 
) to purchase all of its 1,500 gas stations in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
According to [ORG COSAN  ] , this deal will make them the world 's first fully integrated renewable energy company . 
In April , [ORG BP  ] announced a joint venture with [PER Santelisa Vale  ] ( the second largest sugarcane crusher ) , to build and operate two ethanol refineries . 
This partnership makes [ORG BP  ] the first petroleum company to buy a commanding role in the ethanol market and positions the new company , [LOC Tropical Bioenergia  ] , to compete with [ORG COSAN  ] for the position of [LOC Brazil  ] 's leading sustainable renewable fuels supplier of ethanol . 
[ORG Petrobras  ] has also publicly announced the intention to begin construction of a USD 315 million ethanol pipeline in 2009 connecting mills in five states with maritime terminals . 
( [ORG Note: Petrobras  ] enjoys a substantial advantage in building any pipeline , since the new line would be built along rights-of-way where current petroleum and mixed-use pipelines are located . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( U ) Many companies that are not making the headlines for the [ORG SAO PAULO  ] 00000269 004.2 OF 004 marriage of petroleum and biofuels are looking to ramp up their investments in infrastructure in an effort to address existing bottlenecks . 
In addition to [ORG Petrobras  ] , industry leaders such as Crystalsev , [ORG Copersucar  ] , and [ORG Brenco  ] have all announced export-driven projects to build pipelines to move ethanol from producing regions to port . 
[ORG Brenco  ] 's plan calls for a USD one billion investment to build 10 additional refineries and a 700 mile six-terminal pipeline to link its inland refineries with the Port of [LOC Santos  ] . 
This pipeline could potentially halve transportation costs for ethanol to move from inland distilleries to port . 
The timeframe to build such pipelines depends largely on the growth of worldwide ethanol demand as well as access to credit. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( U ) Port infrastructure remains a contentious subject . 
While there are several billion-dollar private port projects on the table , all are being held up until the [ORG Supreme Court  ] rules on the legality of private companies building and operating ports to move their own goods . 
Until this issue is resolved , private port investment , including for the ethanol industry , is moving ahead cautiously . 
Coimex , a [MISC Brazilian  ] logistics company that is among those wishing to build a private port , is for the time-being looking to build a liquid terminal for ethanol storage in the Port of [LOC Santos  ] . 
Mining and logistics company [PER Vale  ] ( formerly [ORG CVRD  ] ) - which already uses its extensive railroad , port , and maritime terminals to provide services for [MISC Brazilian  ] agriculture - is likewise planning the construction of a maritime terminal in [LOC Vitoria  ] in partnership with [MISC Oiltanking.  ] ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( U ) High oil prics and growing numbers of flex-fuel cars will signficantly increase domestic demand for ethanol . 
Ths can be expected to continue to drive [LOC Brazil  ] 's xpanded sugarcane cultivation and ethanol producion , and any increase in foreign demand will addfurther pressure to expand production . 
Ethanol exports face several significant hurdles including dmestic [MISC Brazilian  ] infrastructure that inhibits inreased exports as well as potential fallout in sme quarters over the linkage between biofuels an food inflation ( Ref C ) . 
Other environmental and labor concerns are additional obstacles which could impede the growth of [MISC Brazilian  ] ethanol exports . 
To the extent that [LOC Brazil  ] 's private sector can be considered a bellwether , a series of recent investment announcements indicate that industry leaders believe that the future of ethanol domestically and for export is bright .
