[ORG RIO AUTHORITIES WEIGH  ] OPTIONS FOR NEXT FAVELA PACIFICATION <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [LOC Rio  ] state and police authorities will decide the next target ( s ) for the [ORG Favela Pacification Program  ] ( [ORG FPP  ] ) in the coming weeks . 
During an October 29 meeting with consulate officers to lay out the [ORG FPP  ] strategy and time-line , [PER Roberto Alzir  ] , Superintendent for [ORG Operational Planning from Rio  ] 's [ORG State Security Secretariat  ] , said [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] Governor [PER Sergio Cabral  ] would decide by the end of the November whether to " pacify " five less populated , lower-threat favela communities or focus on one largely populated , higher-threat favela by the end of the year . 
Four other favelas with some 90,000 residents are currently pacified , i.e. mostly free of gang activity and with the population accessible for city services and social assistance ( [ORG Note: As  ] reported in reftel A , the " pacification " of a favela community involves state police special operations units ( [ORG BOPE  ] ) first entering a favela by force . 
Once criminal elements that control a favela are purged , state-administered [ORG Pacification Police Unit  ] ( [ORG UPP  ] ) officers then replace traditional police forces , in order to maintain order , foster long-term ties between the state and the community , and assist with the delivery of basic services to the favela . 
End Note . 
) RIO'S FAVELAS PACIFIED IN FIVE YEARS TIME ? <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG FPP  ] objectives encompass over 100 favela communities , using 12,000 [ORG UPP  ] officers , within a target time horizon of five years . 
According to [PER Alzir  ] , the [ORG FPP  ] strategic plan envisions the pacification of 131 favela communities , with a total affected population of approximately 780,000 residents - including the key , drug gang-controlled favelas Complexo [PER de Alemao  ] , [ORG Rocinha  ] , and Complexo de Mare . 
He said this goal would normally take 13-15 years to achieve , but the [LOC Rio  ] government sought to accomplish the objective within five years . 
In order to do so , security officials plan to increase the number of [ORG UPP  ] officers - the centerpiece of the [ORG FPP  ] strategy - to 12,000 , as well as increase overall [ORG Military Police  ] ( [ORG MP  ] ) numbers to 55,000 by 2016 . 
( Note: [ORG UPP  ] ranks currently number only 500 officers , of a total of 36,000 [ORG MP  ] men and women . 
End Note ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Alzir  ] stated increasing police recruitment was critical to making the five year horizon viable , and said [LOC Rio  ] state would be seeking federal funding to increase police salaries ( [ORG Note: Standard MP  ] officer monthly salary is approximately 1,000 [MISC Brazilian  ] Reals , or 600 USD . 
[ORG UPP  ] officers earn an additional 500 [MISC Brazilian  ] Reals , or 300 USD , paid for by the [LOC Rio  ] municipal government . 
End Note . 
) Stating , " The state does not have enough money , " [PER Alzir  ] explained the [LOC Rio  ] state government was asking for federal assistance to cover the increase ( amount unspecified ) until 2016 , when the state would assume the additional amount . 
CRITERIA FOR SELECTION RIO DE JAN 00000365 002 . 
2 OF 002 5 . 
( C ) In selecting favelas for pacification , state and police authorities weigh location , strategic impact , tactical terrain , and resource requirements , with final approval coming from the Governor . 
Showing consulate officers a satellite image of a pacified favela 's radius of gunfire reach , extending well into [LOC Rio  ] 's famed [LOC Copacabana  ] neighborhood and beach area , [PER Alzir  ] explained the [ORG FPP  ] 's goal was to prioritize favelas adjacent to concentrated tourist areas . 
In selecting favelas for pacification , security officials first gather intelligence to develop a comprehensive profile for each community , crafting tactical maps that show primary access and escape routes , known drug gang hideouts and strongholds , and key civilian points , such as schools and churches . 
Authorities also weigh the strategic impact of a pacification . 
They analyze this information against manpower and resources available , and draw up a list of suitable target favelas . 
The Governor , with recommendations from the [ORG MP Police  ] Chief and State Secretary for Security , then selects the community. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Alzir  ] explained his biggest concern about the [ORG FPP  ] was losing progress due to change of governments . 
" We need the next state government to pursue this , to continue with this commitment , " That said , [PER Alzir  ] expressed optimism that [ORG Rio  ] 's hosting of the 2016 [MISC Olympics  ] will make state , local , and federal authorities " move forward , faster " on favela pacification . 
COMMENT <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While [PER Alzir  ] did not specifically name the [LOC Complexo de  ] [PER Alemao  ] - controlled by the [PER Comando Vermelho  ] ( [ORG Red Command  ] ) drug faction - as the large , high-threat candidate for pacification by year 's end , it is likely the principal stronghold [ORG Rio  ] authorities have their sights on . 
Rio State Secretary for Security [PER Jose Mariano Beltrame  ] told Principal Officer on September 22 this favela was the " epicenter of the fight , " and stated a pacification operation would take place there in early 2010 ( reftel A ) . 
On October 17 , [PER Comando Vermelho  ] gunmen shot down a police helicopter , killing four officers ( reftel B ) , and , in retaliation , [ORG MP  ] tactical raids since targeted 14 [PER Comando Vermelho-controlled  ] favelas . 
Given that any police operation into [LOC Complexo de  ] [PER Alemao  ] would be " traumatic " in terms of scale of violence , however , it is unlikely that the [ORG Rio  ] security apparatus would be prepared to launch an operation into [LOC Complexo de  ] [PER Alemao  ] before the December holidays and February Carnival festivities. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Whether [ORG Rio  ] 's next step involves a high-profile operation in [LOC Complexo de  ] [PER Alemao  ] or the pacification of smaller , easier-to-secure favelas , we anticipate continued unintended consequences , such as those reported in reftel [PER C. In  ] yet another example of such consequences , a neighborhood association from the affluent [LOC Leme  ] neighborhood recently met with State Security Secretary [PER Beltrame  ] to complain about the expansion of the [MISC Babilonia-Chapeu  ] Mangueira favela - one of [LOC Rio  ] 's four pacified favela communities - that borders [LOC Leme  ] . 
According to the neighborhood association , the new-found stability in this favela is attracting squatters from other areas , resulting in a flurry of hastily - and illegally - constructed new abodes and rising crime rates in the neighborhood . 
We will continue to monitor and report on such developments , as well as how ongoing [ORG FPP  ] operations bear on [ORG Rio  ] 's overall security , commercial , and social environment .
