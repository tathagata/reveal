End Summary . 
[LOC IRAN  ] AND REGIONAL AIR AND MISSILE DEFENSE: ------------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) On October 12 , [ORG U.S. Air Forces Central  ] ( USAFCENT ) Commander Lt Gen [PER Mike Hostage  ] and Charge d'Affaires called on the [MISC Crown  ] Prince . 
The [ORG CP  ] commended COMAFCENT for now being forward deployed to [ORG Al Udeid Air Base  ] in [LOC Qatar  ] because it was important to spend time with the [MISC U.S.'  ] counterparts in the [LOC Gulf  ] . 
If more [LOC U.S.  ] troops were added into [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and [LOC Iran  ] tried to delay the process begun in [LOC Geneva  ] , [PER Shaikh Salman  ] commented that there would be tough months ahead for the region . 
As the [ORG P5  ] 1 pursued its carrot and stick approach with [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Salman  ] wondered if [LOC Tehran  ] would pursue a " tit for tat " in its military posture . 
Because of the lack of sophisticated intelligence gathering among the [LOC Gulf  ] states , the [ORG CP  ] observed that the press " plays a propaganda war into our psyche . 
" He decried [LOC Iran  ] 's interference in [LOC Iraq.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) Lt Gen Hostage explained that , because of the threat posed by [LOC Iran  ] to the region , his primary goal was to work on establishing [ORG Regional Integrated Air  ] and [ORG Missile Defense  ] ( [ORG RIAMD  ] ) between the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [ORG GCC  ] states . 
First , this involved integrating the [MISC U.S.'  ] own air and missile defense assets ( [ORG Navy Aegis  ] , [ORG Army Patriots  ] , etc . 
) . 
Then he would offer to link each [LOC Gulf  ] state into a [MISC Shared Early Warning  ] ( [MISC SEW  ] ) [ORG Common Operating Picture  ] ( COP ) , to the extent that each government was willing to participate . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] would share the same picture to all , and each could add as much information as it liked , while keeping data it did not wish to share behind a secure firewall. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) The [ORG CP  ] responded that this would be the largest game changer because it would be a permanent fixture and would affect [LOC Iran  ] 's ability to project power . 
He thanked the [LOC U.S.  ] for the two [LOC U.S.  ] Patriot batteries stationed here and said he would like to help further integrate the [LOC Gulf  ] states into [ORG RIAMD  ] project because it would not be enough without everyone 's participation . 
He cautioned , however , that the [LOC U.S.  ] would have to lead the effort and it would have to be bilaterally with each government , with a multilateral system as the long-term goal . 
He asked whether and where the [LOC U.S.  ] would deploy a [ORG THAAD  ] ( [ORG Theater High Altitude Air Defense  ] ) system to the [LOC Gulf  ] . 
Gen Hostage replied that the location was not yet certain , but yes , [ORG THAAD  ] would be deployed within a year , and would prove to be a very capable mid-course intercept system . 
Prince [PER Salman  ] worried that , in an attack scenario , [LOC Iran  ] would try to swarm and overwhelm specific targets and we would all have to be ready for that. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) Lt Gen Hostage pointed to the [ORG Air Warfare Center  ] in the [LOC UAE  ] as a [ORG Center of Excellence  ] ( [ORG COE  ] ) . 
A [ORG COE  ] for [ORG RIAMD  ] could be established there as well as a training vehicle to help the [LOC Gulf  ] states get comfortable with the technical solutions so they could share information . 
[PER Shaikh Salman  ] said he wanted [LOC Bahrain  ] to be part of the solution . 
He noted that [LOC Bahrain  ] had been the first [ORG GCC  ] government to participate in [ORG Task Force  ] 152 and it liked to be a leader . 
" Consider us serious partners , " he stated . 
IRAN: TO DEGRADE OR DETER ? -------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) Lt Gen Hostage asked for the [ORG CP  ] 's views of [LOC Iran  ] 's willingness to deal in good faith with the [ORG P5  ] 1 . 
[PER Shaikh Salman  ] said his views had not changed - [LOC Iran  ] 's behavior would continue to be problematic . 
However , he speculated that the reason [LOC Iran  ] had changed course and cooperated with the [ORG P5  ] 1 in [LOC Geneva  ] was due to [MISC Russian  ] President [PER Medvedev  ] 's comment at [LOC UNGA  ] that sometimes sanctions were unavoidable . 
[ORG CDA  ] pointed [LOC MANAMA  ] 00000611 002 OF 002 out that as the [ORG P5  ] 1 pursued a dual track strategy of engagement and preparing for sanctions , the [ORG GCC  ] countries' roles would be important . 
Confirming that [LOC Bahrain  ] would do what it could to keep the pressure on [LOC Iran  ] , the [ORG CP  ] lamented that [LOC Gulf  ] countries had few levers on [LOC China  ] . 
He thought that if [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] were to sell more oil to [LOC China  ] , it would help provide some leverage. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) The [ORG CP  ] asked whether [LOC Russia  ] had shipped its [MISC S-300  ] air defense system to [LOC Iran  ] yet . 
Lt Gen [PER Hostage  ] said no . 
[PER Salman  ] said he was sure that the international community would have to wait until the next election in [LOC Iran  ] to see real internal changes . 
The regime was still in firm control and [PER Ahmadinejad  ] was consolidating his power , even as the economy was failing . 
The world would need a strategy led by the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" We are still a ways away from knowing whether force is necessary , " the [ORG CP  ] stated . 
BAHRAIN'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE EFFORT IN [LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The [ORG CP  ] asked whether the [LOC U.S.  ] was changing its goals in [LOC Afghanistan  ] to a strategy of reconciliation and power sharing with some elements of the [ORG Taliban  ] while targeting senior [ORG Al Qaeda  ] figures . 
Lt Gen [PER Hostage  ] said a way had to be found to let the [MISC Afghans  ] live in their , not our , version of peace , but he wondered whether it could be done on our timeline . 
[PER Shaikh Salman  ] counseled patience as with the implementation of the surge in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Lt Gen Hostage and Charge thanked him for [LOC Bahrain  ] 's commitment to contribute a company from its security forces to provide inner perimeter security at a coalition base in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Shaikh Salman  ] stated that his father [PER King Hamad  ] had approved a budget of USD 13 million for the deployment the day before , so the troops would have the necessary equipment. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The [ORG CP  ] asked whether the [LOC U.S.  ] would still need to deploy aerial refueling tankers to [LOC Isa Air Base  ] . 
Lt Gen Hostage related that AFCENT 's problems with the [ORG Manas Air Base  ] ( [ORG Transit Center  ] ) in [LOC Kyrgyzstan  ] had been resolved .
