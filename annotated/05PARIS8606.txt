( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: [PER Sarkozy  ] advisor and former Education Minister [PER Francois Fillon  ] told the Ambassador December 20 that [PER Sarkozy  ] had a chance to buck the [MISC French  ] predisposition to vote against the ruling party in 2007 by focusing his presidential campaign on the electorate 's deep-seated desire for real " change . 
" [PER Fillon  ] argued that the victor in 2007 would need to make the presidency more personally accountable and involved in explaining government policy to the populace . 
The [ORG EU  ] , in [PER Fillon  ] 's opinion , is struggling under the weight of new members , and it was time to bring the [LOC UK  ] into the [MISC Franco-German  ] union in order to move the body forward . 
[PER Fillon  ] believed transatlantic relations would be more cordial under a [PER Sarkozy  ] presidency ; although disagreements would certainly arise , they would be handled in a more nuanced manner . 
[PER Fillon  ] elaborated on [PER Sarkozy  ] 's plan to improve the [MISC French  ] economy through welfare reform and greater flexibility for businesses , and offered his own views on needed changes for the [MISC French  ] education system . 
End Summary . 
2007 Elections -------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ambassador met December 20 with [PER Francois Fillon  ] , former Minister of Education ( 2004-2005 ) and Social Affairs , Labor , and [PER Solidarity  ] ( 2002-2004 ) in the [LOC Raffarin  ] government , who was named in July 2005 to be the Political Counselor to [PER Nicolas Sarkozy  ] in his role as president of the Union for a [ORG Popular Movement  ] ( [ORG UMP  ] ) . 
[PER Fillon  ] noted the instability of the [MISC French  ] [LOC Fifth Republic  ] compared to the governments of [LOC Germany  ] and the [LOC UK  ] , and commented that the [MISC French  ] electorate always voted for change . 
This suggested that the [ORG Socialist Party  ] ( [ORG PS  ] ) should logically win in 2007 , but [PER Sarkozy  ] had a chance because he was a strong proponent for change , whereas the [ORG PS  ] had turned into a party of " restoration " of the status quo ante . 
He insisted that most [MISC French  ] voters really do want change , although he conceded that they are also afraid of losing what they have . 
[PER Chirac  ] always erred on the side of [MISC French  ] fears rather than a desire for change and [PER Villepin  ] 's big liability would be that he is seen as a continuation of [PER Chirac  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] , by contrast , was betting that people really wanted reform. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Fillon  ] believed that [PER Sarkozy  ] would remain in the government until January of 2007 , when the [ORG UMP  ] would officially nominate its presidential candidate , at which time he would break with Chirac/Villepin to run for the presidency . 
He said that [PER Chirac  ] and [PER Villepin  ] would do everything possible in the meantime to trip him up . 
The recent unrest in the suburbs had not hurt [PER Sarkozy  ] , [PER Fillon  ] noted , because he was seen as taking action on the issue . 
[PER Fillon  ] did not foresee a cohabitation government , saying , " The people will choose a president and give him a majority " in Parliament . 
[ORG Institutional Reform  ] -------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Elaborating on his statement that the [MISC French  ] [LOC Fifth Republic  ] is inherently " unstable , " [PER Fillon  ] said there was a need to move to a presidential system in which the president would have to take a more active role in explaining the government 's actions to the people and the parliament . 
( The only such public appearance by [PER Chirac  ] was his disastrous [MISC Town Hall-style  ] appearance in early May in favor of the [ORG EU  ] Constitution . 
) While there were also arguments in favor of a more parliamentary system , [PER Fillon  ] said that it would be impossible to convince the [MISC French  ] electorate to abandon the election of a president by universal suffrage . 
Nor was in possible any longer for the president to remain above the fray , he said , then blame everything on the PM . 
The move to a five-year presidential term of office had reinforced this trend . 
He characterized what he said was a [ORG PS  ] plan to weaken the powers of the presidency in favor of the prime minister as " unrealistic . 
" The [ORG EU  ] ------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG EU  ] currently suffered from a lack of direction and leadership , [PER Fillon  ] said . 
He explained that enlargement was the main problem , which made it difficult to take decisions efficiently . 
" We can hardly express ourselves in meetings " with 25 members , he lamented , since there was no time to take the floor more than once . 
In order to move the [ORG EU  ] forward , [PER Fillon  ] saw a need to expand the [MISC Franco-German  ] " couple " into a [MISC Franco-Germano-British  ] " menage a trois . 
" His basic point was that it was hollow to think that [LOC Europe  ] could progress without the [LOC UK  ] . 
He saw the emergence of [PER Angela Merkel  ] as positive , while commenting that [PER Chirac  ] was trying to make his relationship with her appear closer than it was in the vane of the mythical [MISC Franco-German  ] tandem . 
Returning to his analysis of the [MISC French  ] electorate , [PER Fillon  ] argued that the May 29 [MISC French  ] referendum vote was not a rejection of change or [LOC Europe  ] , but in fact a vote for a more radical overhaul of the system . 
This coincided with the tendency of the [MISC French  ] to vote against the current government , which had backed the [ORG EU  ] Constitution . 
However , [PER Fillon  ] conceded this was his interpretation , and that it was difficult at the moment to accurately draw conclusions from the referendum vote . 
U.S.-French Relations --------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Fillon  ] thought a [PER Sarkozy  ] government would better be able to work together with the [LOC U.S.  ] , and be less overtly critical and more nuanced in its public statements . 
Under [PER Sarkozy  ] , he continued , disagreements would not as easily lead to blow-ups with close and vital allies . 
At the same time , he cautioned , this would not change the very real anti-American sentiments of some parts of the [MISC French  ] populace . 
In response to the Ambassador 's comment that [LOC France  ] is perceived as an obstacle to [LOC U.S.  ] ambitions for [ORG NATO  ] , [PER Fillon  ] noted that there needed to be a better balance in [ORG NATO  ] between [LOC Europe  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] First , however , he said that [MISC Europeans  ] themselves needed to be clearer about their priorities . 
Separately , [PER Fillon  ] noted that [PER Sarkozy  ] did not necessarily see the need for high levels of defense spending . 
Economy ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On economic issues , [PER Fillon  ] called for fusing welfare with unemployment so that the unemployed would be more compelled to take jobs they were offered . 
He noted that a [PER Sarkozy  ] economic system would push for more flexibility for businesses and a simplification of the work codes . 
He also advocated breaking the power of unions , including requiring that elections be held every several years with open candidacies . 
Education --------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Fillon  ] spoke at length about giving schools more autonomy ( citing this as yet another area where [LOC Europe  ] was falling behind ) , but stopped short of recommending decentralization . 
He criticized the burdensome bureaucracy of the education system and lamented that the short time that leaders remain in power limited their ability to effect change . 
Increasing immigration required adaptation of the system , but [LOC France  ] had avoided such adjustments . 
He thought universities should become independent , and that communes should assume more responsibility for early education . 
He talked about using limited resources for overtime pay for those teachers willing and most able . 
Comment ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Fillon  ] came across as a seasoned , non-dogmatic , and serious political figure . 
He appeared pragmatic , forthcoming , accessible , and open to continued dialogue . 
He has commented publicly on his disappointment at not being included in the [PER Villepin  ] government because of his support of [PER Sarkozy  ] . 
[PER Fillon  ] is among [PER Sarkozy  ] 's closest advisors , and is considered a potential prime ministerial candidate should [PER Sarkozy  ] be elected president in 2007 .
