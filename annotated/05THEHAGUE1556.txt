( C ) [MISC SUMMARY:  ] The [MISC Dutch  ] are increasingly worried that [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Chavez  ] is actively seeking to reduce or eliminate [MISC Dutch  ] influence in the [MISC Antilles  ] , including by force if necessary . 
While some in the [LOC GONL  ] argue that greater engagement with [PER Chavez'  ] government is necessary to reduce misunderstandings , others , including FM Bot , openly state that a [MISC Dutch/U.S.  ] military presence in the region is a necessary deterrent to [MISC Venezuelan  ] territorial ambitions . 
Post believes the [MISC Dutch  ] would appreciate and benefit from high-level consultations on this issue at an early opportunity . 
See guidance request in para 6 . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On June 1 , Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] ( accompanied by [ORG Embassy  ] DEA representative and [ORG POLCOUNS  ] ) was invited to brief members of the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG MFA  ] 's [ORG Western Hemisphere Affairs  ] department on his recent trip to the [LOC Netherlands Antilles  ] . 
Following a detailed discussion of successful [MISC Dutch-U.S.-Antilles  ] cooperation in combating illegal narcotics trafficking , [PER Marianne Kappeyne  ] van [PER de Coppello  ] ( Director of the [ORG Western Hemisphere Department  ] ) raised growing [MISC Dutch  ] concerns about [MISC Venezuelan  ] intentions vis-a-vis the [MISC Antilles  ] . 
Noting that [MISC Antilles  ] Prime Minister Ys would be visiting the [LOC Netherlands  ] June 6 , she stressed that the [MISC Dutch  ] worried that he was facing mounting pressure both from [LOC Venezuela  ] directly and from members of his own government , including former deputy PM [PER Cova  ] , who favored a more pro-Venezuelan line . 
She expressed concern that a pro-Venezuelan , anti-Dutch/U.S. government could emerge from the January elections. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Kappeyne  ] van [PER de Coppello  ] said that [MISC Venezuelan  ] influence over certain groups in the [MISC Antilles  ] was being used to undermine [MISC Dutch-Antilles-U.S.  ] cooperation in the fight against drugs . 
She noted that the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG MFA  ] had called in the [MISC Venezuelan  ] Ambassador recently to protest recent remarks by [PER Chavez  ] reviving old [MISC Venezuelan  ] territorial claims to the islands . 
Although the [MISC Venezuelan  ] constitution , she noted , still formally considers the islands ( including [LOC Aruba  ] , [ORG Curacaou  ] and [ORG Bonaire  ] ) to be part of [LOC Venezuela  ] , until recently the [MISC Dutch  ] have had no reason to worry about [LOC Venezuela  ] 's intentions -- but that is now changing . 
Given the [LOC Netherlands  ] [MISC Antilles'  ] dependence on [MISC Venezuelan  ] oil , she added , [PER Chavez  ] has several means at his disposal for exercising leverage.. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) As a first step , [PER Kappeyne  ] van [PER de Coppello  ] said the [MISC Dutch  ] government planned to increase contacts with the [MISC Venezuelan  ] government to reduce possible misunderstandings . 
Simultaneously , however , the [MISC Dutch  ] would like to begin a dialogue with the [LOC U.S.  ] on how to deal with the issue . 
[PER Karel de Vey Mestagh  ] , [ORG Kingdom Affairs Advisor  ] for the [ORG MFA  ] , suggested that a lowering of the [LOC U.S.  ] profile in the area -- i.e. , fewer ship visits , etc. -- could help reduce tensions . 
He was immediately contradicted , however , by [PER Lucita Moenir-Alam  ] , the [ORG Dutch Consul General-designate  ] for [LOC Miami  ] ( and native [MISC Antillean  ] who formerly worked for the [LOC Netherlands Antilles  ] government in [LOC Curacao  ] ) , who argued that the [LOC U.S.  ] profile provided an essential deterrent . 
In response to a question from the Ambassador , [PER Kappeyne  ] van [PER de Coppello  ] stressed that the [MISC Dutch  ] response to [MISC Venezuelan  ] requests to reduce the degree of counternarcotics trafficking cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] had been a crystal clear no . 
5 , ( C ) Later the same day , the issue was raised again in a meeting between Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] and Foreign Minister [PER Bot  ] . 
[PER Bot  ] was emphatic that the [MISC Dutch  ] took [PER Chavez'  ] sabre rattling seriously , and stressed that only the [MISC Dutch  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] presence in the region deterred [LOC Venezuela  ] from taking the near islands by force: if we left tomorrow , the next day they would be part of [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
Even though 92 percent of [MISC Antilleans  ] wished to remain part of the [ORG Kingdom of the Netherlands  ] , he said , a small group headed by former PM [PER Cova  ] wishes to sever this connection . 
This could lead quickly to the realization of [MISC Venezuelan  ] claims , he added , as [LOC Venezuela  ] would never tolerate an independent [LOC Antilles  ] . 
Comparing [PER Chavez  ] to [PER Simon Bolivar  ] , [PER Bot  ] argued that he wishes to go down in history as a liberator and struggler against colonialism , and , unfortunately , [LOC Aruba  ] , [LOC Curacao  ] , and [ORG Bonaire  ] present the closest and juiciest opportunity for him to realize this vision . 
[PER Bot  ] disdainfully called [MISC Spanish  ] PM [MISC Zapatero  ] a fool for thinking that [LOC Europe  ] should seek a more productive relationship with [PER Chavez  ] under these circumstances. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) COMMENT AND GUIDANCE REQUEST: Justified or not , the [MISC Dutch  ] are clearly worried that [LOC Venezuela  ] is engaged in a serious campaign to reduce or eliminate [MISC Dutch  ] influence in the [LOC Netherlands Antilles  ] . 
If successful , such an outcome would have considerable negative implications for the [LOC U.S.  ] , particularly with regard to our ability to conduct counternarcotics and other missions in the region . 
At the moment , the [MISC Dutch  ] are divided on how to deal with [PER Chavez  ] , and would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this and other regional issues at an appropriate level . 
Post believes the [MISC Dutch  ] would be very receptive to an offer to engage in consultations on this issue in The [LOC Hague  ] , [LOC Washington  ] , or the [LOC Netherlands Antilles  ] at an early opportunity . 
Post would appreciate guidance from [ORG WHA  ] and [ORG EUR  ] on whether they would support such consultations at this time and , if so , recommendations on format , timing , and location .
