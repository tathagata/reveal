Godec  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) ------- Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The Ambassador and his wife had dinner with [PER Mohammad Sakher El Materi  ] and his wife , [PER Nesrine Ben Ali El Materi  ] , at their [LOC Hammamet  ] home July 17 . 
During the lavish dinner [PER Al Materi  ] raised the question of the [ORG American Cooperative School  ] of [LOC Tunis  ] and said he would seek to “fix the problem prior to the Ambassador’s departure” as a gesture to a “friend.” He praised President [PER Obama’s policies  ] and advocated a two-state solution for [LOC Israel  ] and the [MISC Palestinians  ] . 
He also expressed interest in opening a [ORG McDonald’s  ] franchise and complained about the government’s delay in passing a franchise law . 
He expressed pride in his [MISC Islamic  ] [PER Zaitouna  ] radio and in the interviews with opposition party leaders published in his newly purchased newspaper publishing group . 
During the evening , [PER El Materi  ] was alternately difficult and kind . 
He seemed , on occasion , to be seeking approval . 
He was living , however , in the midst of great wealth and excess , illustrating one reason resentment of President [PER Ben Ali’s  ] in-laws is increasing . 
End Summary. ------------------ The [ORG ACST Situation  ] ------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Presidential son-in-law and wealthy businessman [PER Mohamed Sakher El  ] [PER Materi  ] , and his wife , [PER Nesrine Ben Ali El  ] [PER Materi  ] hosted the Ambassador and his wife for dinner at their [LOC Hammamet  ] beach residence July 17 . 
El [PER Materi  ] raised the [ORG American Cooperative School  ] of [LOC Tunis  ] ( [ORG ACST  ] ) , asking what was happening . 
The Ambassador explained the situation and emphasized that there is anger and concern in [LOC Washington  ] and the [MISC English-speaking American/international  ] community in [LOC Tunis  ] . 
He said if the school is closed , there would be serious consequences in our relations . 
[PER El Materi  ] said he could help and would seek to resolve the situation immediately , i.e. , prior to the Ambassador’s departure . 
He wished , he said , to do so for a “friend.” He noted that he had helped the [LOC UK  ] Ambassador secure several appointments ( including a lunch with the Prime Minister ) for [LOC UK  ] Prince [PER Andrew  ] during his recent visit . 
Before his intervention , [PER El Materi  ] said , the Prince had only one appointment with a single [LOC Minister.  ] --------------------- Freedom of Expression --------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Ambassador raised the need for more freedom of expression and association in [LOC Tunisia  ] . 
El [PER Materi  ] agreed . 
He complained that , as the new owner of [LOC Dar Assaba  ] , the largest private newspaper group in the country , he has been getting calls from the Minister of Communications complaining about articles he has been running ( Comment: This is doubtful ) . 
He laughed and suggested that sometimes he wants to “give [LOC Dar Assaba  ] back.” [PER El  ] [PER Materi  ] noted the interviews his newspapers have been running with opposition leaders ( he mentioned FDTL Secretary General [PER Mustapha Ben Jaafar  ] ) . 
He was clearly proud of the interviews. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG El  ] [PER Materi  ] said it was important to help others , noting that was one reason he had adopted a son . 
The Ambassador mentioned the [MISC Embassy’s  ] humanitarian assistance projects , noting they could not get media coverage . 
El [PER Materi  ] said forcefully they should be covered , that it was important the Embassy seek such coverage . 
He said it would counteract some of the negative [LOC US  ] image . 
The Ambassador asked if [ORG El  ] [PER Materi  ] would send reporters to do stories on the [LOC US  ] assistance projects . 
[ORG El  ] [PER Materi  ] said yes , absolutely. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG El  ] [PER Materi  ] complained at length about [MISC Tunisian  ] bureaucracy , saying it is difficult to get things done . 
He said communication inside the bureaucracy is terrible . 
He said people often “bring wrong information” to the President implying he had to get involved sometimes to get things corrected. ---------------------------------- On [ORG Exterior Politics and Economics  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG El  ] [PER Materi  ] praised President [PER Barack Obama’s  ] new policies . 
He said the invasion of [LOC Iraq  ] was a very serious [LOC US  ] mistake that had strengthened [LOC Iran  ] and bred hatred of the [LOC United States  ] in the [MISC Arab  ] world . 
He pressed for a two state solution to resolve the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] dispute and indicated [LOC Tunisia  ] needs to accelerate convertibility of the dinar . 
In general , however , [ORG El  ] Materi’s knowledge of and interest in international political and economic issues seemed limited. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The Ambassador raised economic liberalization , noting the importance of opening up to franchising . 
[ORG El  ] [PER Materi  ] agreed , noting that he would be pleased to assist [ORG McDonald’s  ] to enter [LOC Tunisia  ] , suggesting they begin at the new cruise port in [LOC La Goulette  ] . 
He complained about the unhealthy food served by [ORG McDonald’s  ] , however , adding it is making [MISC Americans  ] fat . 
He also complained about the [MISC GOT’s  ] delay in passing a franchising law. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The Ambassador noted he has been asking [MISC Tunisians  ] what ideas they have for the new [LOC US  ] President and Administration . 
El [PER Materi  ] commented that [PER Nesrine  ] would like more done on the environment . 
The Ambassador responded by explaining some of the [MISC Administration’s  ] policies on the environment . 
El [PER Materi  ] said [PER Nesrine  ] is focused on organic products and wants everything ( even the paint and varnish ) in their new house in [LOC Sidi Bou  ] Said ( next to the Ambassador’s residence ) to be organic. ----- [PER Islam  ] ----- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG El  ] [PER Materi  ] said he had begun to practice [PER Islam  ] seriously at 17 . 
He repeatedly said he was practicing , and had a strong faith . 
( [LOC NB  ] . 
He went off to pray at the sunset call to prayer . 
) He suggested that if you have faith and pray to [PER God  ] , he will help . 
He emphasized that his religion is personal , and he does not believe it is appropriate to impose his views on others . 
( Comment . 
During the evening , [ORG El  ] [PER Materi  ] seemed at his most passionate when describing the [MISC Koran  ] , his belief in one [PER God  ] , and the importance of [PER Mohamed  ] as the final prophet of [PER God  ] . 
) <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG El  ] [PER Materi  ] said he was proud of [LOC Zeitouna  ] radio , the first and only [MISC Tunisian  ] Koranic radio station , and discussed how [LOC Zeitouna  ] bank would be opening . 
He hopes to create a regional version of [LOC Zeitouna  ] radio to spread the Malakite school of [PER Islam  ] . 
He expressed the view that [MISC Islamists  ] and extremists pose a great threat to [PER Islam  ] and modernity . 
He said he follows [PER Islam  ] , but modern [ORG Islam.  ] --------------------------------------- [PER El-Materi Unplugged: Home/Personal Life  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) El-Materi’s house is spacious , and directly above and along the [LOC Hammamet  ] public beach . 
The compound is large and well guarded by government security . 
It is close to the center of [LOC Hammamet  ] , with a view of the fort and the southern part of the town . 
The house was recently renovated and includes an infinity pool and a terrace of perhaps 50 meters . 
While the house is done in a modern style ( and largely white ) , there are ancient artifacts everywhere: [MISC Roman  ] columns , frescoes and even a lion’s head from which water pours into the pool . 
[ORG El Materi  ] insisted the pieces are real . 
He hopes to move into his new ( and palatial ) house in [LOC Sidi Bou  ] Said in eight to ten months. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The dinner included perhaps a dozen dishes , including fish , steak , turkey , octopus , fish couscous and much more . 
The quantity was sufficient for a very large number of guests . 
Before dinner a wide array of small dishes were served , along with three different juices ( including [MISC Kiwi  ] juice , not normally available here ) . 
After dinner , he served ice cream and frozen yoghurt he brought in by plane from [LOC Saint Tropez  ] , along with blueberries and raspberries and fresh fruit and chocolate cake . 
( [LOC NB  ] . 
[ORG El Materi  ] and [PER Nesrine  ] had just returned from [PER Saint Tropez  ] on their private jet after two weeks vacation . 
[ORG El Materi  ] was concerned about his [MISC American  ] pilot finding a community here . 
The Ambassador said he would be pleased to invite the pilot to appropriate [MISC American  ] community events . 
) <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG El Materi  ] has a large tiger ( “Pasha” ) on his compound , living in a cage . 
He acquired it when it was a few weeks old . 
The tiger consumes four chickens a day . 
( Comment: The situation reminded the Ambassador of [PER Uday Hussein’s  ] lion cage in [LOC Baghdad  ] . 
) [ORG El  ] [PER Materi  ] had staff everywhere . 
There were at least a dozen people , including a butler from [LOC Bangladesh  ] and a nanny from [LOC South Africa  ] . 
( [LOC NB  ] . 
This is extraordinarily rare in [LOC Tunisia  ] , and very expensive . 
) <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) They have three children , two girls and a boy . 
[PER Leila  ] is four and another daughter that is about 10 months . 
Their boy is adopted and is two years old . 
The youngest daughter is a [MISC Canadian  ] citizen , by virtue of birth in [LOC Canada  ] . 
The family’s favorite vacation destination spot is the [LOC Maldives Islands.  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG El  ] [PER Materi  ] said he has begun an exercise and diet regime . 
He has , he said , recently lost weight ( it was visibly true ) . 
[ORG El Materi  ] said he eats in a “balanced” way . 
He had just spent an hour on a bike , he claimed . 
[PER Nesrine  ] said she gets no exercise. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Both [ORG El  ] [PER Materi  ] and [PER Nesrine  ] speak [MISC English  ] , although their vocabulary and grammar are limited . 
They are clearly eager to strengthen their [MISC English  ] . 
[PER Nesrine  ] said she loves [LOC Disney World  ] , but had put off a trip this year because of [LOC H1N1  ] flu . 
[PER Nesrine  ] has , for sometime , had [MISC Tamiflu  ] nearby ( even taking it on trips ) . 
Originally it was out of fear of bird flu . 
She packs it for [ORG El  ] [PER Materi  ] too when he travels . 
[PER Nesrine  ] said she has visited several [LOC US  ] cities . 
El [PER Materi  ] had only been to [LOC Illinois  ] recently in connection with the purchase of a plane. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Throughout the evening , [ORG El  ] [PER Materi  ] often struck the Ambassador as demanding , vain and difficult . 
He is clearly aware of his wealth and power , and his actions reflected little finesse . 
He repeatedly pointed out the lovely view from his home and frequently corrected his staff , issued orders and barked reprimands . 
Despite this , [ORG El Materi  ] was aware of his affect on the people around him and he showed periodic kindness . 
He was unusually solicitous and helpful to the Ambassador’s wife , who is disabled . 
Occasionally , he seemed to be seeking approval . 
One western Ambassador in [LOC Tunis  ] , who knows [ORG El Materi  ] , has commented that he has western-style political skills in his willingness to engage with ordinary citizens . 
It is an uncommon trait here. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG El Materi  ] , in recent months , has been ever more visible in the local diplomatic community . 
He has clearly decided ( or been told ) to serve as a point of contact between the regime and key ambassadors . 
[PER Nesrine  ] , at age 23 , appeared friendly and interested , but nave and clueless . 
She reflected the very sheltered , privileged and wealthy life she has led . 
As for the dinner itself , it was similar to what one might experience in a [LOC Gulf  ] country , and out of the ordinary for [LOC Tunisia.  ] <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Most striking of all , however , was the opulence with which [ORG El Materi  ] and [PER Nesrine  ] live . 
Their home in [LOC Hammamet  ] was impressive , with the tiger adding to the impression of “over the top.” Even more extravagant is their home still under construction in [LOC Sidi Bou  ] Said . 
That residence , from its outward appearance , will be closer to a palace . 
It dominates the [LOC Sidi Bou  ] Said skyline from some vantage points and has been the occasion of many private , critical comments . 
The opulence with which [ORG El Materi  ] and [PER Nesrine  ] live and their behavior make clear why they and other members of [PER Ben Ali’s  ] family are disliked and even hated by some [MISC Tunisians  ] . 
The excesses of the [PER Ben Ali  ] family are growing .
