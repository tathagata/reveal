( U ) Post requests an [ORG Embassy Science Fellow  ] to help strengthen the bilateral science research ties between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Iceland  ] . 
[ORG Embassy Reykjavik  ] has designated the expansion of bilateral science ties as a key priority in our [ORG Mission Strategic Plan  ] again this year . 
Post believes that enhanced ties in this area are of considerable importance in the bilateral relationship and will prove materially beneficial to both nations . 
Post was disappointed not to be included in [LOC FY2008  ] 's program and hopes a match can be made for one fellow for the FY2009 program . 
We envision a fellow in one of the following areas ( listed in priority order ) , although we suspect that any scientist in the renewable energy field would be welcome by an [MISC Icelandic  ] institution: -- Starting Up a [ORG Renewable Energy Lab  ] -- Extreme temperature and pressure engineering ( dealing with superheated geothermal fluid in [ORG Deep Drilling  ] ) -- Utilizing low temperature by-product of geothermal power production -- Designing system for growing algae to produce biofuels -- Designing system for raising fish in heated power plant effluent [ORG Renewable Energy Laboratory: Iceland  ] has considerable expertise in the renewable energy fields of geothermal and hydropower and virtually all of their electricity and home heating is produced by renewable energy . 
The [MISC Icelandic  ] government also acquired some top-notch facilities and real estate when [ORG U.S. Naval Air Station  ] Keflavik closed in 2006 . 
One of the institutions to grow out of the former base is the [ORG Keilir Atlantic Center for Excellence  ] , which was formed as a collaborative effort of academic and local government , to provide technical education and eventually university programs . 
[ORG Keilir  ] , with the support of the [ORG National Energy Authority  ] and the [ORG Icelandic Innovation Center  ] , wants to combine the existing renewable energy know-how with the existing buildings to create a renewable energy laboratory along same concept as the [ORG U.S. National Renewable Energy Lab  ] in [LOC Colorado  ] . 
Post feels that an expert in scientific administration issues -- specifically , founding a new institution and matching a vision statement with the resources at hand -- would help the Icelanders start their project , and would build on [ORG U.S. Dept. of Energy  ] efforts in [LOC Iceland  ] to date . 
Extreme Temperature and Pressure [MISC Engineering:  ] The [ORG International Deep Drilling Program  ] is a multi-national geothermal energy project in [LOC Iceland  ] that is drilling 5 kilometer deep wells to harness potential geothermal power predicted to be ten times the power harnessed at shallower depths . 
Among the issues the project faces are the high temperatures ( 240 to 350 degrees Celsius ) for drilling , piping and instrumentation , as well as the scaling and corrosion in pipes and turbines from geothermal fluid . 
Post met with a visiting [ORG NASA  ] engineer who mentioned that high temperature materials , coatings , and instrumentation technologies developed by [ORG NASA  ] may be of use to this research effort . 
A science fellow in this field would considerably boost the project 's chances for success and set the stage for productive follow-on collaboration . 
Utilizing Low Temperature By-Product of [ORG Geothermal Energy Production:  ] The [ORG Icelandic National Energy Authority  ] ( [ORG NEA  ] ) is especially keen to expand the ways of squeezing all the energy out of one geothermal resource . 
[MISC Icelandic  ] utilities are using both high and low pressure turbines , but the question is how to further utilize the 120 to 100 degrees Centigrade resource to maximize the benefits . 
Most of this energy is presently lost in the cooling tower , but the [ORG NEA  ] wants to create " greater sustainability " by establishing other uses for this resource . 
Aquaculture as a Byproduct of [ORG Geothermal Energy: Byproducts  ] of geothermal power plants include a relatively pure carbon dioxide stream and warm water . 
One of [LOC Iceland  ] 's publicly owned water and power utilities is seeking to design a system to grow algae that digest the carbon dioxide emissions . 
The algae could be used to produce oils for a variety of uses , including biofuels or as food additives . 
The same utility is also seeking to design a system that uses the warm water effluent to farm fish . 
The utility has approached post to determine whether [LOC U.S.  ] scientific expertise -- specifically in designing the systems to accomplish the goals of utilizing the power plant wastes -- might be available to further research in this field. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Administrative details: No foreign language skills are necessary . 
It will be easier for post to provide housing for a Summer Fellow , but otherwise [ORG Embassy Reykjavik  ] does not have a preference on timing . 
A minimum of six weeks is desired for the Fellow . 
Visitors staying less than 90 days do not need a visa to enter [LOC Iceland  ] . 
A security clearance is not required for work. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) POC: Post 's point of contact is Economic and Commercial Officer [PER Fiona Evans  ] . 
She can be reached at evansfs@state.gov and +354-562-9100 , ext . 
2295. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) Embassy [MISC Support: Although  ] post has a very small housing pool , there is a slim possibility of some housing availability this summer . 
However , if a science fellow is available to support our first-priority project ( founding of a renewable energy lab ) , post has a pledge of no-cost housing for the fellow from the [ORG Keilir Atlantic Center for Excellence  ] in [LOC Keflavik  ] . 
Housing at [ORG Keilir  ] would be conveniently located to any of post 's proposals and we are exploring the possibility of obtaining transportation support from the fellow 's local sponsor . 
Post is committed to providing a work space and logistical support where possible . 
Due to post 's tiny staff , we cannot provide in-country travel arrangements . 
These proposals have country team approval .
