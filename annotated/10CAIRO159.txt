( C ) Deputy Secretary [PER Lew  ] , we warmly welcome you to [LOC Cairo  ] and are seeking meetings with Prime Minister [PER Nazif  ] , Foreign Minister [PER Aboul Gheit  ] , and Minister of [ORG International Cooperation Aboulnaga  ] . 
While we continue to work closely and effectively with [LOC Egypt  ] on the range of critical regional issues , our bilateral discussions , particularly relating to human rights , civil society and democracy , and their relationship to the [ORG ESF  ] program , remain difficult at times . 
President [PER Obama  ] 's speech here in June helped immensely to broaden this conversation , making it clear that the [LOC US  ] intends to work in partnership with [LOC Egypt  ] and our regional allies to meet the challenges the people and governments of the region face . 
However , we have also been clear that the [LOC U.S.  ] considers democracy and development two sides of the same coin , and that our policy toward assistance will reflect that principle. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Your interlocutors may convey their disappointment that the new [ORG Administration  ] has yet to respond fully to their proposal for restructuring [LOC U.S.  ] economic assistance to [LOC Egypt  ] . 
In particular they seek the [ORG Administration  ] 's intentions for the next five-ten years , noting not only that such a multi-year perspective has been the norm for the [MISC US-Egypt  ] [ORG ESF  ] relationship , but also that the [ORG GOE  ] cannot adequately plan multi-year projects without reference to expected sources of foreign assistance . 
They may also raise [ORG GOE  ] objections to continued [LOC U.S.  ] funding , through non-ESF funds , of non-registered [MISC Egyptian  ] civil society organizations . 
You will hear a different view during your visit from some of our civil society interlocutors and have an opportunity to reassure them of the [ORG Administration  ] 's continuing support for [LOC Egypt  ] 's economic development and political reform. ------------------------------------------ [PER Aid: Pillar  ] of a [ORG Strategic Partnership  ] ... ------------------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [LOC Egypt  ] 's leading position among pro-Western [MISC Arab  ] governments aligns it with key [LOC U.S.  ] strategic goals , including comprehensive [MISC Arab-Israeli  ] peace , countering [MISC Iranian  ] ambitions , supporting [LOC U.S.  ] military efforts in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and counter-terrorism cooperation . 
As a cornerstone of our bilateral relations , [LOC U.S.  ] assistance , both [ORG ESF  ] and [ORG FMF  ] , has nurtured [LOC Egypt  ] 's strong support for [LOC U.S.  ] regional policies while also serving as a visible symbol of [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to [LOC Egypt  ] and the welfare of its people. --------------------------- ... and a Source of Tension --------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In recent years , however , as [ORG ESF  ] funds have declined , and democracy and civil society have been emphasized , the assistance relationship has become at times as much a source of tension as a symbol of partnership . 
Tensions over the [LOC U.S.  ] approach to democratic reform and human rights led to an impasse when the previous multi-year [ORG ESF  ] agreement expired . 
Without consultation with [LOC Egypt  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] cut the [ORG ESF  ] program by over 50 percent from $415 million in [LOC FY2008  ] to $200 million in [MISC FY2009  ] but promised to sustain this level for five years . 
The [ORG GOE  ] never accepted this unilateral decision and effectively suspended negotiations on [MISC FY2009  ] program implementation . 
Only the assurance that conditionality language would not reappear in 2009 and the [PER Obama  ] administration 's agreement to raise the [ORG ESF  ] level to $250 million for 2010 and to respect previous agreements to fund only registered [ORG NGOs  ] via bilateral [ORG ESF  ] smoothed the way to resume programming for 2009 and beyond . 
The subsequent addition of $50 million via the [MISC FY2009  ] supplemental for [LOC North Sinai  ] development was welcomed by the [ORG GOE  ] but has created new challenges as the [ORG MIC  ] seeks to rewrite standard [ORG USAID  ] agreements to reflect the sensitive nature of the [MISC Sinai  ] programs. ------------------------------------- Recasting the [ORG Assistance Relationship  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Minister of [ORG International Cooperation  ] ( [ORG MIC  ] ) [PER Fayza Aboulnaga  ] has told us that the [ORG GOE  ] seeks to end all [ORG ODA  ] programs for [LOC Egypt  ] within ten years based on their projections of economic growth . 
[PER Aboulnaga  ] has been the most vocal and unrelenting advocate of restructuring the [MISC U.S.-Egyptian  ] assistance relationship . 
( We note that most of the line ministries in the government continue to seek and appreciate the traditional role that [ORG USAID  ] has played . 
) She is the originator of the mega-endowment proposal ( $3.6 billion over ten years ) , that would eliminate [ORG ESF  ] over ten years , and , in her view , significantly limit the likelihood of political conditions being placed on endowment funding . 
She will argue that the proposal reflects a more mature [MISC U.S.-Egypt  ] relationship that would set the stage for the eventual closure of the [ORG USAID Mission  ] to [LOC Egypt.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Although the [MISC Egyptians  ] are aware that their ambitious multibillion dollar endowment concept has found no support in [LOC Washington  ] , they will likely pursue the concept even if a scaled down version . 
The Minister of [ORG International Cooperation  ] may press the case for directing current [MISC Egyptian  ] ESF-loan repayments to the endowment , noting that it is " not right " that [ORG ESF  ] appropriations are less than [ORG GOE  ] debt repayments to the [LOC U.S.  ] She has been told clearly and repeatedly that debt repayments to the [LOC U.S.  ] will not be part of discussions on assistance but continues to pursue this goal . 
[ORG Aboulnaga  ] has also led the campaign to halt all USG-funding of non-registered [ORG NGOs  ] and may possibly raise with you the [ORG DRL  ] and [ORG MEPI  ] funding of such organizations . 
[LOC Egypt  ] has also steadfastly refused to register [ORG NGOs  ] such as [ORG IFES  ] , [ORG ABA  ] , [ORG NDI  ] , and [ORG IRI  ] , thought the [ORG GoE  ] tolerates their activity here. ------------------ Slow Roll on [MISC Sinai  ] ------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Our effort to conclude negotiations to obligate the FY 2009 $50 million supplemental for assistance to the [LOC Northern Sinai  ] has moved at a glacial pace . 
Out of respect for the very real security concerns in the [MISC Sinai  ] , we agreed early on that the [LOC U.S.  ] would keep a very low profile on the [MISC Sinai  ] projects and allow [ORG GOE  ] ministries to implement the contracts directly . 
[ORG MIC  ] has , nevertheless , haggled over every element of the agreement process , possibly in an effort to establish new bilateral precedents that would govern future [ORG USAID  ] projects in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
We hope that you stress to the [MISC Egyptians  ] that demonstrating credible and timely implementation of the [MISC Sinai  ] projects will be an important justification for ongoing [ORG ESF  ] support for [LOC Egypt  ] . 
While the [LOC U.S.  ] respects the security challenges in the [MISC Sinai  ] , we do not understand the excruciating focus on changing language that has been used in countless previous agreements. --------------- More to Be Done --------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Although [LOC Egypt  ] , with large-scale [LOC U.S.  ] funding , has made significant development progress in a broad range of areas , daunting development challenges remain . 
There is broad bilateral agreement that future [LOC U.S.  ] assistance should focus on human capacity development , with a focus on education and training , strengthening civil society , building institutional capacity to sustain key services , and augmenting [LOC Egypt  ] 's competiveness . 
In conveying a vision of what our assistance program will look like in the coming years you would help signal a return to normalcy in our assistance relationship. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
Key points for your meetings with [ORG GOE  ] officials may include the following: - Express that the [LOC U.S.  ] regards long-term development assistance as a key component in fostering a mutually beneficial bilateral relationship. - Reiterate that it is premature to discuss the phase-out of the [ORG ESF  ] program . 
President [PER Obama  ] laid out an ambitious agenda for partnering with our allies in the region , including on education , S&T , entrepreneurship , and civil society . 
We need [LOC Egypt  ] to be a part of that . 
( Note: the [ORG Mission  ] strongly recommends sharing with the [ORG GOE  ] the Administration 's intentions with regard to future [ORG ESF  ] levels . 
) - Reaffirm the [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to development in the [MISC Sinai  ] and convey the urgency to begin implementation of program activities there. - Reaffirm that the [LOC U.S.  ] cannot support an endowment proposal of the magnitude the [ORG GOE  ] envisions , or one that includes debt relief. - Confirm the intention of the [LOC U.S.  ] to provide a counterproposal on a possible endowment funded by [ORG ESF  ] but one that begins on a smaller scale than that proposed by the GOE. - Emphasize that the [LOC U.S  ] will remains committed to providing assistance , through a variety of programs , that bolsters [LOC Egypt  ] 's civil society , helps [LOC Egypt  ] expand the protection of basic human rights , and enhances government transparency . 
Registering respected [LOC U.S.  ] and international [ORG NGOs  ] such as [ORG IFES  ] , [ORG ABA  ] , [ORG NDI  ] and [ORG IRI  ] would send the right signal .
