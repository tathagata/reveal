( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY: In response to reftel , Econoff visited [ORG AVIBRAS  ] munitions manufacturing site and met with company president [PER Sami Hassuani  ] on January 8 . 
The company appears to have adequate security measures to protect sensitive [MISC USML  ] items . 
[PER Hassuani  ] provided copious documentation to support the transaction . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG AVIBRAS  ] 's supporting documentation included an approximately 1,000 page long sales contract from the [ORG Government of Malaysia  ] . 
It included detailed descriptions of the product , including blueprints . 
A Principle Deputy Assistant Secretary level representative of the [ORG Government of Malaysia  ] ( [ORG GoM  ] ) had signed the contract and it contained the original seal of the [ORG GoM  ] . 
[PER Hassuani  ] also showed original documentation from a similar contract with the [ORG GoM  ] in 2000 . 
Plaques , given as gifts to his company for its services from various countries' militaries , decorated an entire wall in his office . 
[PER Hassuani  ] even showed Econoff his [ORG Association of the U.S.  ] Army card , showing his membership since 1984. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG ABIBRAS  ] has four sites , divided into munitions , armor and plating , civilian , and administrative . 
The compounds themselves are located some distance from the main road and protected by security guards . 
The munitions facility is located about one mile off kilometer 14 of the [LOC Tamoios  ] highway , near the city of [LOC Sao Jose  ] dos [LOC Campos  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Upon arrival to the compound , the security guard requested Econoff turn off his cell phone , even though there appeared to be no reception available in the isolated compound . 
[ORG AVIBRAS  ] also retains a member of the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Air Force  ] to serve as their security liaison . 
The liaison officer conducts background investigations and grants security clearances to all [ORG AVIBRAS  ] employees and contractors , in addition to periodic reviews of compound security. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 .

[ORG AVIBRAS  ] does not serve as a broker , which [PER Hassuani  ] says is against [MISC Brazilian  ] law .

[PER Hassuani  ] runs the day-to-day operations of the [ORG AVIBRAS  ] . 
The company at one time employed 6,000 people , although today that number has fallen to 1,200. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 .
