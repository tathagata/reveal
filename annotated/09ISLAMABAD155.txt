End summary. <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [LOC U.S.  ] CENTCOM Commander General [PER David Petraeus  ] , accompanied by the Ambassador , [ORG J5 Major General  ] [PER Robert Allardice  ] and POLAD [PER Michael Gfoeller  ] , met with [LOC Pakistan  ] Chief of the [ORG Army Staff  ] ( [ORG COAS  ] ) General [PER Ashfaq  ] [PER Kayani  ] on January 20 . 
[PER Kayani  ] was accompanied by his Director General Military Operations , [ORG Major General  ] [PER Javed Iqbal  ] , his Chief of [MISC Staff  ] , Lieutenant General [PER Muhammad Mustafa Khan  ] , and his Senior [MISC Aide  ] , [PER Brigadier Zubeir  ] . 
Musharraf’s Situation --------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In opening remarks regarding General [PER Kayani  ] , s likely move into the official [ORG COAS  ] residence , [PER Kayani  ] observed that former President [PER Musharraf  ] , s situation seemed to be fine , even though he had been concerned earlier about [PER Zardari  ] , s failure to grant amnesty to [PER Musharraf  ] . 
[PER Kayani  ] observed that amnesty should have been granted immediately when [PER Zardari  ] assumed office , but it seemed as if the situation had settled down and he was no longer as concerned about President [PER Musharraf  ] , s legal situation . 
( Comment: Former President [PER Musharraf  ] is visiting his family in the [LOC U.S.  ] and also undertaking speaking engagements . 
The construction of Musharraf’s house near [LOC Islamabad  ] is well advanced , so he may be able to move out of the [ORG COAS  ] house in the next few weeks . 
End Comment ) [ORG Coalition Support Funds  ] ----------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Kayani  ] spoke candidly about the process of reimbursement of [ORG Coalition Support Funds  ] ( [ORG CSF  ] ) . 
He said it was important to avoid the impression that the [LOC Pakistan  ] military is “for hire.” Still , the military had little incentive to provide the copious documentation , since only 40 percent of the money had been returned to military coffers in the past . 
[PER Kayani  ] said the money had mostly supported the federal government’s budget . 
The typical breakdown had been about 60 percent to the federal government , 40 percent to the military , but President [PER Zardari  ] had told him recently that the entire amount would be reimbursed to the military . 
[PER Kayani  ] suggested that the [ORG CSF  ] reimbursement amount “mirror” the system used for the [MISC UN’s  ] reimbursement of peacekeeping expenses or establish a base period and estimate the increase in military activity from that base . 
[PER Petraeus  ] indicated that he believed that the prospects for the “Enhanced [MISC Partnership with Pakistan  ] Act” also known as the [MISC Biden-Lugar  ] legislation , which would provide $1.5 billion for development activities , were positive , and there were plans underway to fund [LOC Pakistan  ] , s military needs . 
[ORG IDPs: Humanitarian and Strategic Issue  ] -------------------------------------- ISLAMABAD 00000155 002 OF 003 <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Kayani  ] explained that his military budget had been flat lined , and therefore had dropped sharply in real terms ; military spending now represented only 16 percent of the government’s budget . 
He said the [LOC Pakistan  ] military needed basic equipment like helmets , protective gear , and personnel carriers . 
[PER Kayani  ] was particularly concerned about the status of internally displaced persons ( [ORG IDPs  ] ) , who were displaced from their homes by fighting . 
This was not only a humanitarian problem , but also a strategic one . 
[PER Kayani  ] said he had no capacity to compensate civilians who had been injured or whose property had been destroyed. “If we don , t do that , ” [PER Kayani  ] said , “we will lose the battle for public opinion.” [PER Kayani  ] said that the provincial government lacks the capacity to help the [ORG IDPs  ] . 
He emphasized the importance of carrying forward the [LOC Bajaur  ] operation . 
[PER Kayani  ] noted that at first he had thought the army “should stay out of politics , ” but it was increasingly obvious that the military would have to become involved in the IDP situation . 
Ambassador noted that the international community had also dropped the ball on providing relief for the [ORG IDPs  ] and was now rushing to catch up . 
[LOC Swat Valley  ] ----------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Kayani  ] was clear that the [MISC GOP  ] had lost control of the [LOC Swat  ] valley . 
He said the police had no ability to come in after the army to “hold” territory . 
He recounted that half of the 600 police officers , supposedly from the [LOC NWFP’s  ] elite police units , destined for [LOC Swat  ] had deserted , largely because there was no command structure . 
[PER Petraeus  ] replied that the [LOC U.S.  ] had confronted this same issue in [LOC Iraq  ] , describing it as a “clear and leave” strategy , requiring the retaking of the same ground multiple times . 
[PER Petraeus  ] observed that the police are the most vulnerable , since they are exposed in communities . 
[PER Petraeus  ] noted that increased measures to control population movements would probably have to be put in place throughout the country , which would require considerable manpower . 
[ORG Frontier Corps  ] -------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Petraeus  ] said that the [ORG Frontier Corps  ] ( [ORG FC  ] ) was working well with [ORG Special Operations Forces  ] , largely because of the leadership of the [ORG Frontier Corps Inspector General Major General  ] [PER Tariq Khan  ] . 
[PER Petraeus  ] noted that the 11th Corps Chief of [ORG Staff Brigadier Amir  ] was less cooperative with [LOC U.S.  ] forces , and [PER Kayani  ] took note of that . 
[PER Kayani  ] said he had concentrated on improving the [ORG Frontier Corps  ] and brought salaries and rations on a par with the regular army . 
He had also extended to the [ORG FC  ] a benefit package for the families of those killed in the line of duty . 
[PER Kayani  ] added that [ORG FC  ] successes in combat had understandably increased morale . 
[PER Kayani  ] mused about the “glorification of terrorism” ( particularly the pictures of dead combatants in the press ) and said [LOC Pakistan  ] needed press laws similar to those in the [LOC UK.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Kayani  ] and [PER Petraeus  ] agreed that some of the civilian/military projects , which had been impeded at the 11th [ORG Corps  ] , needed to be speeded up . 
[PER Petraeus  ] had given instructions that [ORG Special Operations Forces  ] would be deployed regularly and constantly , and the [LOC U.S.  ] “needed to move their soldiers in here , so they could engage productively with the [ORG FC.” Pakistan/India  ] -------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Petraeus  ] said the most important threat to [LOC Pakistan  ] was on the western border and internally . 
Terrorists were an existential threat to [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[PER Kayani  ] agreed . 
However , [PER Kayani  ] observed that he had postponed a missile test . 
The [MISC Indians  ] , he said , in contrast , had conducted one just a few hours before . 
[PER Kayani  ] said he had no intention to resume missile testing as long as the current tensions persisted . 
He promised to be transparent with allies about his plans and had briefed us about his move of 6000 troops to the [MISC Indian  ] border . 
[PER Kayani  ] said he was determined to exercise restraint in his actions with [LOC India  ] . 
He recounted that he had taken no [LOC ISLAMABAD  ] 00000155 003 OF 003 action the evening that [MISC Indian  ] External Affairs Minister [PER Pranab Mukherjee  ] had supposedly called President [PER Zardari  ] and threatened to declare war . 
[PER Kayani  ] asked to be alerted if the [LOC U.S.  ] had any warning of another attack - he understood that the [MISC Indians  ] had been warned about the [LOC Mumbai  ] attack . 
He mentioned that discussion of the consequences of a follow-on attack made both [LOC India  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] hostage to extremists and increased the likelihood of an attack. “If there is any clue about another attack , ” he said , “please share it with us.” Next Steps ---------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Kayani  ] returned to the issue of [ORG CSF  ] at the conclusion of the conversation , saying that he hoped to have the May [ORG CSF  ] submission soon , but we needed to develop a simpler way of handling [ORG CSF  ] claims . 
[PER Petraeus  ] said he would look at options quickly . 
[PER Kayani  ] and [PER Petraeus  ] agreed that progress had been made on the [ORG Border Coordination  ] centers and that additional communications capacity needed to be added . 
[PER Petraeus  ] pressed [PER Kayani  ] on moving forward with setting up the additional facilities inside of [LOC Pakistan.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Petraeus  ] said he was looking forward to welcoming [PER Kayani  ] to [LOC Tampa  ] during his February 2009 counterpart visit . 
[PER Kayani  ] said he hoped , after consultation with the Prime Minister and the President , to bring a roadmap for consideration by [LOC U.S.  ] officials. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 .
