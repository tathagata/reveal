( S/NF ) Although an info addressee , per reftel invitation Embassy offers the following comments . 
The initiative on disrupting external financing to the [ORG Taliban  ] could help induce the [ORG GOS  ] to reenergize the fight against [ORG Taliban  ] financing , among other reasons because [LOC Spain  ] has some 600 soldiers deployed in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
But , as a September 2 [ORG El Pais  ] article ( also appeared in the September 5 [MISC English  ] language version of [ORG El Pais  ] ) made clear , there are doubts , including among senior [ORG GOS  ] officials , regarding the efficacy of the fight against terrorism finance , especially designations . 
[PER See Septel  ] for a summary of the article . 
We remain confident that the [ORG GOS  ] checks for funds based on the prenotifications we deliver . 
And anecdotal evidence suggests that the formal financial sector takes the terrorism finance regulation/oversight role by the [ORG Bank of Spain and Ministry of Economy  ] seriously and considers the terrorism related compliance regulations to be extensive . 
Our sense is that a renewed focus on operational cooperation would provide the greatest impetus in intensifying the fight against terrorism finance in [LOC Spain  ] . 
There is already a joint [MISC U.S.-Spain Counterterrorism Working Group  ] . 
While not a perfectly functioning entity , perhaps this group could do more in the terrorism finance prevention area . 
Embassy offers the following suggestions with respect to reftel . 
A ) We should continue to expend energy on getting al-Qa'ida financier [PER Imad Eddin  ] [MISC Barakat Yarkas  ] designated . 
This should be relatively easy as he has already been convicted of membership in a terrorist organization . 
The practical effect of designating him may be limited as he is in jail , but it would certainly have some symbolic value . 
We can certainly continue to press on [PER Barakat Yarkas  ] cohort [PER Driss Chebli  ] . 
He has been tried , but his conviction was overturned on appeal . 
Although a conviction is not required for designation in [LOC Spain  ] , we suspect his release will continue to make the [ORG GOS  ] balk at designating him . 
B ) We should continue to press the [ORG GOS  ] to adopt implementing regulations for its 2003 terrorism law . 
Once implementing regulations are adopted , the [ORG GOS  ] would have preventative freezing mechanisms . 
We understand that a turf battle between the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] ( which stands to gain authorities ) and the [ORG Bank of Spain  ] ( which stands to lose authorities ) is partly to blame for the continued non-adoption of the implementing regulations . 
We also understand that the regulations have gotten entangled with jurisidictional battles between the central and regional governments . 
C ) Consider intensifying terrorism finance cooperation in the context of the [MISC U.S.-Spain Counterterrorism Working Group  ] . 
Information from the [LOC Afghanistan  ] Threat Finance Cell ( [ORG ATFC  ] ) in [LOC Kabul  ] could perhaps form the basis for investigations in [LOC Spain  ] - there are a number of hawalas with [LOC Pakistan  ] links ( and therefore almost certainly with [LOC Afghanistan  ] as well ) operating in [LOC Spain  ] . 
[MISC Spanish  ] authorities would probably be willing to , upon request , intensify intelligence operations against these entities . 
[ORG Interior Ministry  ] Secretary of State for Security , [PER Antonio Camacho  ] . 
( a regular [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy interlocutor ) noted during his intervention at the November 2005 [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Embassy-Ortega  ] y Gasset terrorism finance conference that dealing with hawalas was big challenge for [MISC Spanish  ] law enforcement . 
D ) Reftel says that the [LOC U.S.  ] is working to establish an information-sharing mechanism to be used against the [MISC Afghan  ] narcotics trade with [LOC U.K.  ] and [MISC Russian  ] counterpart agencies . 
As a [ORG NATO  ] ally , [LOC Spain  ] has deployed 600 troops in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and is a major drug importer for transshipment and domestic consumption purposes . 
We believe we should consider cooperating in the same way with [LOC Spain  ] . 
E ) As part of the [MISC Treasury-led  ] effort to bring the hawala sector in [LOC Afghanistan  ] under formal regulation , perhaps an international workshop on this topic could be arranged . 
[MISC Spanish  ] authorities have the same issues with respect hawalas operating in [LOC Spain  ] . 
F ) Assuming [MISC Spanish  ] participation would be welcome , Embassy would be willing to encourage [MISC Spanish  ] participation in the envisioned December workshop on charities . 
The workshop may want to bill itself as dealing with a broader range of organizations than " charities " . 
The [MISC Spaniards  ] tell us that there are few , if any , [MISC Islamic  ] charities per- se operating in [LOC Spain  ] . 
There are , however , mosques that engage in charitable activities . 
The press has reported that the [ORG Spanish National Policy  ] ( [ORG SNP  ] ) has completed a survey of the approximately 600 mosques in [LOC Spain  ] . 
It might be worthwhile having a [MISC Spaniard  ] discuss the results of this work .
