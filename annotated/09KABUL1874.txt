Minister [PER Atmar  ] described a decision to use [ORG USAID  ] funding to help recruit women voter searchers .

END COMMENT . 
Some discussion centered on the need to ensure rapid installation of local governance in [LOC Helmand  ] districts freed by on-going operations . 
The President questioned the Defense Minister about the lack of “an [MISC Afghan  ] face” in those operations . 
END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) On 12 July President Karzai’s weekly election security meeting included his Foreign , [ORG Interior  ] , and Defense Ministers ; NDS Intelligence Chief , Vice-Chairman of the [ORG Disarmament Process  ] ( [ORG DIAG  ] ) , Chairman of the [ORG Independent Electoral Commission  ] , [ORG NSC  ] advisor and Director-General of the [ORG Office of Administrative Affairs and Council of Ministers Secretariat  ] . 
Of foreigners , the [ORG DSRSG  ] , [ORG COMISAF  ] , [ORG Ambs  ] . 
[PER Eikenberry Ricciardone  ] , [PER Carney  ] and RAO Chief attended. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Discussion heavily centered on the agenda item calling for security assessment of the nearly 7,000 polling centers . 
The Defense Minister noted that instructions have gone out for the range of relevant [MISC Afghan  ] and [ORG ISAF  ] authorities to reconnoiter sites and prepare a detailed plan to secure them , a plan based in realities of terrain and on the level of threat . 
Minister [PER Wardak  ] described the 11 July Election Security Rehearsal as “a positive step toward proper preparation for election.” He noted the need for another week’s time to complete reconnaissance and preparation of a detailed plan for securing the polling center sites . 
The President pushed , wondering how many sites have received assessment team visits so far . 
The Interior Minister replied that of the 6,966 centers , 400 sites have been visited so far . 
He noted that mainly the police alone , ( sometimes with the [ORG ANA  ] ) had done the trips . 
Nor had they made any security plans for the sites as yet . 
He would issue instructions to add such planning , not merely to visit . 
NDS Chief [PER Saleh  ] said that he has received the full list of centers from the [ORG IEC  ] and would have a report of sites visited for next Sunday’s meeting . 
[ORG IEC  ] Chairman [PER Lodin  ] gave a report that noted dispatch of up to 90% of ( non-sensitive ) electoral materiel without incident . 
He spoke vaguely about some non-Taliban [MISC Afghan  ] “troublemakers.” He cited problems in [LOC Herat  ] , in two districts , and scored “high level officers” as “saying [LOC KABUL  ] 00001874 002 OF 004 things that benefit the [MISC Taliban.”  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG DSRSG  ] [PER Galbraith  ] cast doubt on the possibility of using , much less securing , all of the polling centers . 
He had just visited [ORG Khost  ] where , he noted , in response to the Defense [MISC Minister’s  ] questioning of his sources , local electoral and government officials had said they must co-locate 50 of the more remote polling centers together with the remaining 125 centers in the province . 
[PER Galbraith  ] expressed the suspicion that from one quarter to one third of polling centers in other provinces of insurgent presence would probably need the same treatment . 
The President doubted if the local population would be willing to go to the relocated polling centers . 
The [ORG DSRSG  ] explained that such centers would be relocated to market town where people normally go to shop , not as close , but along routes the people know . 
He added that turnout would likely be reduced , but not so much as if 50 centers would be unable to open at all . 
After a comment on the need for recruiting women to do security searches of voters ( below ) , the [ORG DSRSG  ] concluded by observing the very short period left in which to recruit and train all polling workers. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] noted the need to complete the surveying of all the polling centers in order to establish the facts and develop plans . 
Professor [PER Lodin  ] recalled the experience of voter registration in which people moved and shifted to other populated areas to get their cards. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) The need for women security checkers has apparently been resolved . 
Professor [PER Lodin  ] said that a total of 28,000 male and female searchers are needed for 7,000 polling centers . 
The [ORG IEC  ] and the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] are in discussion about this need and funds must be found that [ORG USAID  ] can provide . 
Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] recalled that [ORG USAID  ] moneys may not go through the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] as a matter of policy . 
He suggested that the [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] can put funds into the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] as it will receive a budget augmentation from forthcoming [LOC U.S.  ] funds . 
Minister [PER Atmar  ] explained that an 11 July meeting of [ORG IEC  ] , [ORG USAID  ] and others had decided that the [ORG IEC  ] would employ women workers and [ORG MOI  ] would train them in search techniques . 
In this context he noted a decision to give women provincial council candidates one bodyguard each . 
He stated that , on the President’s instruction from the previous meeting , twenty IEC-identified warehouses would be subject of a “decision” for security that he did not explain. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Interior  ] Minister also raised his earlier remarks about a “controversial map” that questioned assumptions about safe areas . 
He contended that , rather than relocate polling centers and thereby risking to disenfranchise voters , he proposed to: a ) deploy forces to secure priority ( not all ) districts ; b ) Organize community leaders . 
Something that can work is the [LOC U.S.  ] is willing to help with financing . 
Without such [LOC U.S.  ] resources , [LOC KABUL  ] 00001874 003 OF 004 [ORG MOI  ] would do what it could . 
President [PER Karzai  ] interjected that [PER Atmar  ] should take “our resources , ” that he understood $1.5M would be necessary and do it . 
The [ORG Finance Ministry  ] would reimburse [ORG MOI  ] . 
[ORG MOI  ] , NDS , IDLG and others would “put it into action , ” and let the President know if more resources are needed . 
He cut short the contention of Minister [LOC Stanekzai  ] that up to $3.0M might be needed , ending the discussion by reaffirming the figure of $1.5M. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Continuing on the issue of contacting the local community for election security assistance , the President accepted COMISAF’s offer of [ORG Special Forces  ] help . 
He recalled that local community leaders had been important in ensuring that voter registration went well . 
Prof. [PER Lodin  ] noted that local leaders have enabled mobile registration teams to venture out up to 60 KM from province centers where the police normally restrict travel to 20 Km from the centers. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Other electoral needs came under discussion with Minister [PER Atmar  ] noting exchanges at the 11 July election security rehearsal that put [ORG IEC  ] need for helicopters to move sensitive ballot materials after the vote at one per province at least . 
He believed that security sector helicopters would likely be busy . 
He mooted the possibility that the [ORG UN  ] might augment its existing contract with short-term helicopter rental with donor support . 
Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] again noted that the key is to identify the requirement and then to analyze capacity and discuss how to make up any shortfall . 
The [ORG DSRSG  ] agreed , undertaking to look into the possibility of short-term helicopter rentals at this late date in the process. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The President turned to the military situation in [LOC Helmand  ] province , noting that the [MISC Afghan  ] army is not visible and questioning the Defense [MISC Minister’s  ] contention that the army is fully deployed around the country with only a limited number of troops available to join in the operation with the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Marines.  ] “People see the lack of an [MISC Afghan  ] face. , ” noted the President who observed that the [MISC Minister’s  ] suggestion that he might add another battalion as an “insignificant” 600 men . 
He urged the Minister to try finding more forces to deploy in [LOC Helmand.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Further discussion on [LOC Helmand  ] included the [MISC DSRSG’s  ] observation that the flow of internally displaced is less than initially feared . 
He added the need to ensure assignment and appointment of local governance officials as districts are cleared , underscoring the importance of delivering government services rapidly . 
All districts liberated in ongoing operations are having district leaders appointed , according to both Ministers [PER Atmar  ] and [ORG Wardak.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) In other developments NDS Chief [PER Saleh  ] stated that the [LOC Pakistan  ] Army has said they are ready to mediate between [PER Mullah Omar  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Amb  ] . 
[PER Eikenberry  ] said that the [LOC U.S.  ] has reaffirmed to [LOC Pakistan  ] our policy that reconciliation is led through the government of [LOC KABUL  ] 00001874 004 OF 004 [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG COMISAF  ] noted that ISAF forces had entered the embattled district of [ORG Barg-e Metal  ] ( [LOC Pakistan  ] border , northernmost district in [LOC Nuristan  ] ) earlier in the morning without fighting . 
What had happened was not yet clear. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( U ) President [PER Karzai  ] noted an agenda for the 19 July meeting would be out by Thursday , 16 July .
