( C ) SUMMARY . 
This cable , which should be read in conjunction with Septel analysis , details updates over the past year in [LOC Spain’s  ] two major operations - codenamed [MISC Troika  ] ( 2008-09 ) and [ORG Avispa  ] ( 2005-07 ) - to combat “Russian” organized crime in [LOC Spain  ] . 
In [LOC Spain  ] , the term “Russian mafia” usually applies not only to [MISC Russians  ] , but also to many nationalities from the former [LOC USSR  ] , according to [PER Carlos Resa  ] , a professor at the [ORG Autonomous University of Madrid  ] who formerly worked at the [ORG UN Office  ] on Drugs and Crime in [LOC Moscow  ] . 
END SUMMARY. //Op [MISC Troika  ] and its Updates// <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Phase I of [MISC Op Troika  ] , which was executed in June 2008 resulted in the arrest of 20 top leaders of Russia’s [MISC Tambov-Malyshev  ] crime family for criminal conspiracy , money laundering , document falsification and crimes against public finances . 
Most of those arrested were “Vor z [PER Konen”  ] or “Thieves in Law , ” the highest echelon of [MISC Russian  ] [ORG OC  ] leadership . 
In particular , [PER Gennadios Petrov  ] , the alleged leader , [PER Alexander Malyshev  ] , [ORG Petrov’s  ] deputy , and [PER Vitaly Izguilov  ] , a key lieutenant who was out on bail from his arrest in Op [ORG Avispa  ] , allegedly formed the leadership of one of the four largest [ORG OC  ] networks in the world and the largest [MISC Russian  ] [ORG OC  ] network . 
[LOC Spain  ] served as the group’s safehaven from authorities and rival [ORG OC  ] networks in [LOC Russia  ] from which they directed their illicit business . 
[PER Baltasar Garzon  ] , the [ORG National Court  ] judge who directed the investigation , accused the group of laundering money in [LOC Spain  ] that came from a range of illicit activities conducted elsewhere , including contract killings , arms and drug trafficking , extortion , coercion , threats , and kidnapping. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Following the [MISC Troika  ] arrests in June 2008 , details began to appear in the press on the group’s alleged activities and how the investigation developed . 
Less than a month after the arrests , [LOC Spain’s  ] flagship daily , center-left [ORG El Pais  ] , published a detailed article claiming that [PER Alexander Litvinenko  ] - the former [MISC Russian  ] intelligence official who worked on [ORG OC  ] issues before he died in late 2006 in [LOC London  ] from poisoning under mysterious circumstances - tipped off [MISC Spanish  ] security officials on the locations , roles , and activities of several “Russian” mafia figures with ties to [LOC Spain  ] . 
He allegedly provided information on [PER Izguilov  ] , [PER Zahkar Kalashov  ] , and [PER Tariel Oniani  ] to [ORG GOS  ] officials during a May 2006 meeting. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) As reported in Ref A , conservative daily [ORG ABC  ] in July 2008 reported that the [ORG GOS  ] security services tapped “thousands” of conversations in its two-year investigation . 
Unnamed sources told the newspaper that 230 of those intercepts “will make your hair stand on end” for their revelations on the [MISC Troika  ] defendants’ - especially [ORG Petrov’s  ] - immense power and political connections , as well as the range of criminal activity in [LOC Russia  ] that the [MISC Troika  ] defendants directed from [LOC Spain  ] . 
According to the article , [MISC Troika  ] mafia leaders invoked the names of senior GOR officials to assure [LOC MADRID  ] 00000869 002.2 OF 004 partners that their illicit deals would proceed as planned . 
The press suggests this “sensitive” evidence could impact bilateral relations and adds that the “extremely delicate” details of [LOC Op Troika  ] are so close-hold that barely 10 [ORG GOS  ] officials are aware of them all . 
In the context of the clout that [ORG Petrov’s  ] network enjoyed and the political connections it had , multiple [MISC Spanish  ] media outlets reported that one of [ORG Petrov’s  ] intercepted phone conversation suggests the [MISC Russian  ] XXXXXXXXXXXX reportedly was sailing on [ORG Petrov’s  ] yacht on September 6 , 2007 , an allegation that Russia’s Ambassador to [LOC Spain  ] publicly denied as “completely false.” <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) In October 2008 , [ORG GOS  ] authorities raided the [LOC Mallorca  ] vacation mansion of [PER Vladislav Reznik  ] , chair of the [MISC Duma’s  ] financial markets committee and a [PER Putin  ] ally within the [ORG United Russia  ] party ( See Ref B ) . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX There is some debate about whether [PER Reznik  ] bought the house from [PER Petrov  ] or whether it was a gift . 
In any event , the two were regularly seen together on the island , according to press reports . 
[PER Garzon  ] reportedly has ordered Reznik’s arrest for money-laundering and for belonging to a criminal organization . 
[PER Reznik  ] enjoys immunity in [LOC Russia  ] , but [MISC Garzon’s  ] extradition request is valid throughout the [MISC EU-27  ] . 
In August 2009 , the [MISC Spanish  ] press reported that [PER Garzon  ] is investigating claims that [PER Reznik  ] and the [LOC Tambov  ] crime family were involved in a 2008 plot to kidnap the eldest son of [MISC Spanish  ] construction magnate [PER Francisco Hernando  ] del [PER Saz  ] ( aka [MISC Paco  ] el Pocero ) , one of the richest men in [LOC Spain  ] . 
The plot , disrupted in April 2008 , was to ask for a ransom of $30 million dollars . 
The leader of the would-be kidnappers reportedly alleges that he received his orders from [LOC Reznik.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) XXXXXXXXXXX [ORG El Pais  ] on June 7 , 2009 ( Ref C ) claimed that , as a result of [MISC Troika  ] , the [ORG GOS  ] has compiled a “secret list” of [MISC Russian  ] prosecutors , senior military officers , and politicians - including current and former ministers - who may have been involved with the [MISC Troika  ] network . 
According to the article , some of those [MISC Russian  ] officials referred to [PER Petrov  ] as “leader.” XXXXXXXXXXX <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) [ORG Multiple  ] press reports allege that [LOC Moscow  ] was left out of the loop on the [MISC Troika  ] investigation - whose Phase II raid resulted in the detention of three lawyers in southern [LOC Spain  ] in April 2009 - due to Madrid’s fear of leaks to [ORG GOS  ] [ORG OC  ] targets . 
[LOC Moscow  ] reportedly is interested in learning what exactly the [MISC Spanish  ] have as evidence and has sent investigators to [LOC Spain  ] for meetings with [ORG GOS  ] officials on more than a half a dozen occasions since the [MISC Troika Phase  ] I arrests . 
[MISC Spanish  ] President [PER Zapatero  ] and [MISC Russian  ] President [PER Medvedev  ] have met three times since then , including in [LOC Madrid  ] in March 2009 , when the two leaders upgraded the bilateral relationship to a strategic partnership and signed an MoU on cooperation on [ORG OC  ] matters . 
( See Ref D ) . //Op [ORG Avispa  ] and its Updates// <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) Op [ORG Avispa  ] ( “Wasp” in [MISC English  ] ) - the predecessor to [MISC Troika  ] which was directed by [MISC Garzon’s  ] colleague , Judge [PER Fernando Andreu  ] - targeted the [MISC Russian  ] , [MISC Georgian  ] and [MISC Ukrainian  ] [ORG OC  ] presence in [LOC Spain  ] , which allegedly laundered money from illegal casinos in [LOC Russia  ] by investing in the [LOC MADRID  ] 00000869 003.2 OF 004 [MISC Spanish  ] real estate market . 
The op had mixed results: Phase I , executed in 2005 , arrested 28 suspects , 22 of which were alleged “Vor z [PER Konen”  ] ( See Ref E ) . 
Phase II in 2006 arrested nine additional suspects while Phase III in 2007 resulted in three more arrests , including the [MISC Spanish  ] national government’s number-two official in the [MISC Catalan  ] region , for allegedly helping members of the “Russian” mafia secure work visas to allow them to enter the country legally . 
Although [ORG GOS  ] officials in 2005 publicly proclaimed [ORG Avispa  ] a success , subsequent press reports suggest authorities struggled with leaks and bureaucratic snafus . 
[PER Zahkar Kalashov  ] and [PER Tariel Oniani  ] - Georgian-born [MISC Russian  ] citizens who were the primary [ORG Avispa  ] targets - apparently were both tipped off hours before the 2005 raid occurred and fled the country . 
Recent [MISC Spanish  ] press reports suggest the source of the tip-off remains unidentified , although the [MISC Russian  ] security services or a corrupt source within the [ORG GOS  ] have been cited as possible culprits . 
Due to the leak , [PER Izguilov  ] was the most senior person arrested , although he later was released on bond from jail due to a technicality . 
[PER Kalashov  ] - allegedly the top boss of Russia’s “Solnstevo” crime syndicate - was detained in [LOC Dubai  ] in 2006 and quickly extradited to [LOC Spain  ] , which had put out an arrest warrant for him via [ORG Interpol.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) The [MISC Spanish  ] media often describes [PER Kalashov  ] as the “most valuable and well-protected prisoner in a [MISC Spanish  ] jail” and the “highest level mafia boss arrested outside [PER Russia.” Kalashov  ] - like [PER Petrov  ] , [ORG Malyshev  ] , and [PER Izguilov  ] from Op Troika - is in an individual cell in an isolation block ; all four are in different prisons . 
[PER Kalashov  ] faces numerous extra security measures and is periodically moved from prison to prison to foil any plots to break him out of jail , according to [MISC Spanish  ] press ( see Ref F ) . <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) Investigating Judge [PER Andreu  ] in October 2008 formally charged 15 of the 37 people arrested in the first two phases of [ORG Avispa  ] for money laundering , criminal conspiracy , and falsifying commercial documents . 
He is seeking 3-12 years for the defendants , including 12 years and two months for [PER Kalashov  ] , but a trial date has not yet been set. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) Against the backdrop of Lukoil’s reported interest in acquiring a roughly 30 percent stake in [ORG Repsol  ] ( See Refs G and H ) , the [MISC Spanish  ] press in November 2008 highlighted that [PER Kalashov  ] owned a “significant” share in [ORG Lukoil  ] and that he and [PER Tariel Oniani  ] had acted as consultants during 2003-04 to help bring the [MISC Russian  ] energy giant into [LOC Spain  ] to open 150 gas stations , among other projects . 
Citing files provided by [MISC Swiss  ] prosecutors , [MISC Spanish  ] court documents estimate Kalashov’s personal fortune at 200 million euros. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( U ) [PER Kalashov  ] shuffled his attorneys in December 2008 . 
Days later , one of his new lawyers , [PER Alfonso Diaz Monux  ] , was shot dead in his [LOC Madrid  ] garage by unknown hitmen , although by all accounts , [PER Diaz  ] had received death threats for roughly a year due to his work on behalf of another client. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( U ) In March 2009 , the press reported that [MISC Spanish  ] prosecutors had secured the cooperation of a protected witness against [PER Kalashov  ] who made a sworn statement in July 2008 that the crime boss had approached him in 2007 - while both were in prison - to launder 300 million euros . 
The alleged witness , former [MISC Galician  ] drug trafficker [PER Pablo Vioque  ] , was released from prison in April 2008 for health reasons and died of terminal cancer in December 2008 . 
Things took yet another unexpected turn when Vioque’s adult children - days after his death - publicly claimed that their father had never been a protected witness in the [PER Kalashov  ] case and said that he never made a sworn statement to that effect , [LOC MADRID  ] 00000869 004.2 OF 004 although they acknowledged that police officers met their father at their home in his dying days. //GOS Seeks Arrest , Extradition of Additional “Russian” [ORG OC  ] Figures// <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Spanish  ] press reports suggest that [LOC Madrid  ] has expressed interest in the extradition of [PER Tariel Oniani  ] , whom [MISC Russian  ] authorities arrested in [LOC Moscow  ] in June 2009 . 
[LOC Spain  ] has sought [PER Oniani  ] through [ORG Interpol  ] since 2005 . 
However , XXXXXXXXXXXX suggested to POLOFF on August 17 that [LOC Moscow  ] is unlikely to extradite [PER Oniani  ] to [LOC Spain.  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [LOC Madrid  ] in recent months also has sought the arrest of [PER Michael Cherney  ] , a [MISC Russian-born  ] , [MISC Israeli  ] citizen for whom [ORG Spain’s National Court  ] has issued an international arrest warrant that accuses him of money laundering and illicit association in connection with Op [ORG Avispa  ] . 
[PER Cherney  ] ( aka [PER Mikhail Chernoy  ] ) reportedly owns several companies in [LOC Spain  ] that the [ORG Avispa  ] defendants used to help launder money . 
Center-right El Mundo on July 6 , 2009 published a highly detailed account of the GOS’s fruitless efforts to have [MISC British  ] authorities arrest [PER Cherney  ] during a visit to [LOC London  ] in late May . 
[ORG Post’s LEGAT Section  ] confirms the basis of the article .
