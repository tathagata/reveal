[ORG Electoral Reform  ] ---------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] and [MISC Canadian  ] Ambassador [PER Bill Crosbie  ] shared a frank exchange of views during a breakfast meeting at the [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy on February 20 . 
Ambassador [PER Crosbie  ] said that [LOC Canada  ] is very concerned about the electoral reform process . 
He said they had not seen the copy of the final decree submitted to the Parliament on electoral reforms . 
Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] explained the key issues: conflicting Constitutional process issues ( no action allowed the year of an election but requirement to act on emergency decrees within 30 days ) ; the lack of a specific mention of an [ORG ISAF  ] or coalition role in the vetting process ; and the proposed formula of two of five [ORG ECC  ] members being internationals appointed by [ORG UNAMA  ] ( either [MISC South African  ] judge , [MISC Bangladeshi  ] expert or [MISC Palestinian  ] expert are the likely choices ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Crosbie  ] told the Ambassador that getting this right is a bottom line issue for the [MISC Canadians  ] . 
He was emotional , saying the issue makes my blood boil , as he described the [MISC Canadian  ] view that the international community must stand up for the silent majority or be blamed for letting [PER Karzai  ] and his family establish across the country the system of patronage and control that exists in [LOC Kandahar  ] . 
We must be prepared for confrontation with [PER Karzai  ] on this issue , he said , or risk losing credibility among our own population if we go along with a rigged election . 
He argued that a new generation of [MISC Afghans  ] is working to run for Parliament and they are watching to see if the electoral changes will happen . 
We can't be seen to collude with it , he said . 
He argued that we need to give the [MISC Afghans  ] looking to make a difference space to speak out and be able to turn the course of their country. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] questioned [LOC Canada  ] 's assessment , noting that [MISC Afghans  ] will not stand up publicly to support a dominant international role in their election process , regardless of what might be said privately . 
The reality , he said , is that leaders like [PER Abdullah  ] and [PER Mirwais Yasini  ] are not interested in reform but rather their own political interests and alliances in Parliament . 
He cautioned that if we dig ourselves deeper into [MISC Afghan  ] politics , we'll entrench ourselves deeper into the country with fewer options . 
We need to focus on what is good enough while still supporting key institutions. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Crosbie  ] conceded these points , but said we cannot go backwards in terms of the last election . 
Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] agreed , noting that having less Coalition/international ownership of the election is also a measure of progress . 
We need to focus , he said , on strategic options rather than being mired in [MISC Afghan  ] politics . 
For example , increasing the competence and level of the [ORG ANA  ] and [ORG ANP  ] are clear priorities , and we must avoid losing the coming spring and summer mired in election reform issues . 
Ambassador [PER Crosbie  ] did not dispute this , but said that for [LOC Canada  ] a red-line has to be ensuring improvements over the last election . 
[LOC Kandahar  ] -------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Crosbie  ] said we need to have a discussion in [LOC Kabul  ] to complement work in [LOC Kandahar  ] by the [MISC Canadians  ] , the [ORG NATO  ] ISAF [LOC KABUL  ] 00000672 002 OF 003 [MISC RC-South Commander  ] , and the Senior Civilian Representative for the [LOC South  ] . 
He said we need to get discussion organized for addressing power brokers ( [ORG Note:  ] A discussion was started during a meeting held at the [MISC Canadian  ] Embassy two weeks ago attended by Ambassador [PER Wayne  ] , the [LOC UK  ] , [LOC Netherlands  ] , [LOC Australia  ] , and the [ORG NATO  ] ISAF IJC . 
End Note . 
) . 
The strategy , he said , must address how we manage malign actors and improve the management of contracts. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) They also discussed the proposals to realign the reporting structures of the [MISC Canadian-led  ] [ORG PRT  ] in [LOC Kandahar  ] . 
[PER Crosbie  ] said that [LOC Canada  ] is willing to be integrated into a new organization and won't stand on form . 
He agreed with the objective to bring coherence and integration of all civilians in [LOC Kandahar  ] . 
While he has not talked yet to [LOC Ottawa  ] about these issues , he believes that the following changes will be acceptable: 1 ) [LOC Canada  ] will continue to lead the [ORG PRT  ] , with the [LOC U.S.  ] serving in the Deputy role ( co-leads don't work , he said ) ; 2 ) the [ORG PRT  ] will report to [MISC RC-South  ] as opposed to [ORG Task Force Kandahar  ] ; 3 ) civilians will report up the civilian chain , which they view at the [MISC RC-South  ] level as the [LOC U.S.  ] Senior Civilian Representative [PER Frank Ruggiero  ] -- he proposed dual-hatting [PER Ruggiero  ] to be both a [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG ISAF  ] SCR ; 4 ) the Representative of [LOC Canada  ] in [LOC Kandahar  ] ( [LOC RoCK  ] ) and the [ORG PRT  ] head should be me Ambassador to [LOC Argentina  ] will be the next senior [MISC Canadian  ] and will be based at the [ORG PRT  ] ; and 5 ) [LOC Canada  ] will place more civilians at the [ORG PRT  ] to enhance integration , but he understands that the [LOC U.S.  ] will lead the effort in certain areas/districts where [LOC U.S.  ] resources are focused. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] said he too was flexible on how to reorganize and believed that we have reasonable structures in the [LOC South  ] and [LOC East  ] . 
He also strongly endorsed the concept of [MISC RC-West  ] and RC-North adopting the same model . 
While we're putting a lot of resources in the [LOC South  ] and [LOC East  ] , he said , the system needs to work regardless of whether there is an [MISC American  ] flag . 
It 's a mistake for [ORG NATO  ] to see the [MISC Afghan  ] issues only through the prism of the military ; the SCR structures need to be enhanced . 
Ideally , the [MISC Spanish  ] and [MISC Italians  ] would create a regional SCR in the [LOC West  ] , and the [MISC Scandinavians  ] and [MISC Germans  ] would create one in the [LOC North  ] . 
He also encouraged [PER Crosbie  ] to consider placing [MISC Canadian  ] civilians at [LOC Regional Platform-South  ] . 
SCR [PER Ruggiero  ] would mix them into his staff , he said , which would ensure greater coordination . 
[PER Crosbie  ] promised to review this and thought it probably made sense . 
He also noted that additional [MISC Canadians  ] will go to [LOC Kandahar  ] in March to support the civ-mil planning activity underway for governance and development in the wake of the upcoming military operations in [LOC Kandahar  ] . 
Strategy in the [LOC South  ] and Impact on Overall Effort --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Crosbie  ] said that [LOC Canada  ] is comfortable with the overall strategy in [LOC Kandahar  ] , which envisions additional pressure and activity in [LOC Kandahar  ] in [LOC April-May  ] . 
He said the police mentoring by [LOC U.S.  ] Army [ORG Military Police  ] and [MISC Canadian  ] police , who live and work with the [ORG ANP  ] in their district police stations , has proved effective . 
This effort is contributing to the sense of [MISC Afghan  ] authority expanding in the city , he said , although he noted that it is proving difficult in [LOC Dand  ] district where there are continued [MISC IEDs  ] and security issues . 
Still , there 's a sense we're on the right path , he said. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] noted that the efforts in [LOC Helmand  ] and the troop surge generally are intended to reverse the malaise and enhance the confidence of the [MISC Afghan  ] leaders . 
He recounted a recent meeting with [PER Abdullah Abdullah  ] in which he described his perceptions of better security from a year ago . 
The operation in [LOC Helmand  ] , [PER Abdullah  ] said , is not yet getting the national effects but it could when the [ORG ANA  ] and [ORG ANP  ] officers return to their homes and share accounts of their operations . 
Similarly , [PER Abdullah  ] said that the security in [LOC Kunduz  ] is much better than six months ago . 
The jury is still out on whether current coalition efforts will work , but if [PER Karzai  ] becomes more confident and the government has the space to focus on sustainable national governance , there will be progress . 
A key problem , though , is the limited human capacity in most ministries and at the provincial and district level , Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] said . 
He noted the Embassy is working on a cable to better outline the limits of [MISC Afghan  ] ( and even [LOC U.S  ] . 
) capacity to accomplish the strategies we have laid out . 
For example , the Minister of Agriculture is really only about one-two staff deep and he relies heavily on foreign advisors. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Crosbie  ] agreed , citing the example of [ORG ANP  ] literacy . 
[LOC KABUL  ] 00000672 003 OF 003 We're never going to make them literate but can make them literate enough . 
He cited two examples of progress: 1 ) in [LOC Kandahar  ] , some police are starting to at least be able to read license plates when investigating cases ; and 2 ) in a recent customs officer training , the officers at least acknowledged corruption exists and that it 's wrong , which he said is not the case in many third world countries . 
[PER Crosbie  ] said that we'll win when the [MISC Afghans  ] have confidence they can run this country , but we can't get too dug into supporting [PER Karzai  ] ; it 's critical we build support for others . 
[PER Crosbie  ] said he has a sinking feeling whether [PER Karzai  ] is actually in control , or whether it 's his brothers and other advisers who are running him. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] agreed and said that while we support efforts to press him to be a more visible Commander and Chief and push him to get outside of the [ORG Palace  ] , we need to avoid self-delusion that he is really stepping up to lead the country and embrace mutual strategic goals until he clearly does so of his own volition . 
As the meeting ended , [PER Crosbie  ] mentioned the former [ORG ANA  ] senior command and former [LOC Kandahar  ] Governor General [PER Raufi  ] ( Note: He served as Governor from August 2008 - December 2008 before being sacked reportedly for taking on [PER Karzai  ] 's half brother and [LOC Kandahar  ] powerbroker [PER Ahmed Wali Karzai  ] ( [ORG AWK  ] ) ) and noted that he would be a good person to use in a position of interest . 
Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] said he knew him and agreed he could contribute in a positive way .
