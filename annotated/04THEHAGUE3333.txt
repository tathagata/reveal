SUMMARY: ( C ) According to [MISC Dutch  ] diplomat [PER Pieter de Gooijer  ] , the intense [MISC Dutch-led  ] negotiations leading to the [ORG EU Council  ] 's invitation to [LOC Turkey  ] for accession talks were one for the history books . 
In a recent conversation with [ORG DCM  ] and [PER Poloff  ] , he provided the inside story of the last hours of the talks in [LOC Brussels  ] , which he witnessed first hand . 
[PER De Gooijer  ] claimed three events were especially critical in bringing about a positive decision: President [PER Chirac  ] 's seigniorial push to [MISC Cypriot  ] President [PER Papadopoulos  ] ; PM [PER Blair  ] fetching [MISC Turkish  ] PM [PER Erdogan  ] back from his hotel before he could hold a fatal fatal press conference ; and [MISC Dutch  ] finessing of the [ORG Council Conclusions  ] text that welcomed and quoted a [MISC Turkish  ] declaration on the [ORG Ankara Agreement  ] that never really existed . 
END SUMMARY <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Pieter  ] de [PER Gooijer  ] ( [ORG MFA European Integration  ] director and main working negotiator for the Presidency ) related the inside story of the final [LOC Turkey  ] accession negotiations to [ORG DCM  ] and [PER Poloff  ] on the margins of a reception hosted by the [ORG DCM  ] on December 20 . 
[PER De Gooijer  ] was at the center of [ORG Council  ] negotiations with PM [PER Balkenende  ] and FM Bot , starting Thursday , December 16 . 
Looking back , [PER de Gooijer  ] said , PM [PER Balkenende  ] was still angry on the following Monday about how the [MISC Turkish  ] delegation treated him last week and how [PER Erdogan  ] behaved after the fact back home . 
[PER De Gooijer  ] , a veteran of [MISC Turkish  ] postings ( as is FM Bot ) , said [PER Balkenende  ] had missed the back slapping and bear hugs that marked the elated reactions of [LOC Bulgaria  ] , [LOC Croatia  ] and [LOC Romania  ] . 
I had to remind him , as I had done all during the negotiations themselves , that the [LOC Turks  ] came to this like a negotiation for a rug in the bazaar . 
If things had run in a straight line , they would have suspected they could have gotten a better deal . 
By the same token , he added , bazaar psychology dictated that PM [PER Erdogan  ] appear dissatisfied with the result after the fact as well. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) At the beginning on Thursday , December 16 , [PER De Gooijer  ] said that the [LOC Netherlands  ] Presidency delegation met the [LOC Turks  ] around 4:30 pm , where the [MISC Dutch  ] told them they had to do something on [LOC Cyprus  ] . 
There was an immediate and negative [MISC Turkish  ] reaction to signing anything , he recalled . 
With this in mind and while the heads of state were sequestered at dinner , [PER de Gooijer  ] said he proposed that [LOC Turkey  ] could initial the protocol to the [ORG Ankara Agreement  ] . 
Initialing is not as final as signing , he had postulated . 
It was a way for [LOC Turkey  ] to acknowledge that this was where the [LOC Cyprus  ] issue stood , that they could accept the text ad ref . 
Following this plan , the [MISC Dutch  ] had circulated an [ORG Annex  ] to the [MISC Council Conclusions  ] paragraph 19 ( which referred to [LOC Turkey  ] 's signing the protocol of [ORG Ankara Agreement  ] ) that acknowledged the initialing by the [ORG Commission  ] and [LOC Turkey  ] of the Protocol . 
( [ORG Council  ] document [ORG SN  ] 220/04 ) . 
Difficult talks between the [PER Balkenende  ] , FM Bot , [PER Erdogan  ] and FM Gul ensued , with the [LOC Turks  ] eventually rejecting initialing as too much like signing . 
They never appreciated the subtle , negotiator 's distinction between the two , [PER de Gooijer  ] said. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [ORG Annex  ] was withdrawn on Friday morning , December <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] fell back to a proposal that [LOC Turkey  ] could make a declaration of intent to sign the Protocol prior to the actual start of accession negotiations . 
The [ORG Secretariat published  ] this as a revision to [ORG Council Decision  ] paragraph 19 ( [ORG Council Document SN  ] 208/04 ) . 
They got [MISC Turkish  ] approval of the concept in principal and then turned to sell it to [LOC Cyprus  ] . 
[PER De Gooijer  ] recalled a small meeting among President [PER Chirac  ] , [PER Chancellor Schroeder  ] , PM [PER Blair  ] , [ORG Commission  ] President [ORG Barroso  ] , and PM [PER Balkenende  ] with President [PER Papadopoulos  ] ; the full [ORG Council  ] was meeting in a nearby room . 
Both PM [PER Blair  ] and [PER Chancellor Schroeder  ] had made clear their intent to leave [LOC Brussels  ] around 1:30 pm , due to pressing business elsewhere in [LOC Europe  ] . 
With time slipping away for a deal , [PER Papadopoulos  ] balked at a mere declaration . 
Finally , [PER de Gooijer  ] recalled , President [PER Chirac  ] said , [PER Tassos  ] , look . 
[LOC Tony  ] , [PER Gerhard  ] and I all think this is a good solution . 
We have not much time . 
I know you will agree . 
[PER Chirac  ] reportedly then stood up and reached out for [PER Papadopoulos  ] , saying , Now let us go into the meeting . 
And with that , [PER de Gooijer  ] said , [PER Chirac  ] shepherded a slightly stunned [PER Papadopoulos  ] back to the [ORG Council  ] meeting . 
That is how the [ORG EU  ] works in the end , [PER de Gooijer  ] said , with the big countries ganging up on a small hold out. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [MISC Dutch  ] still needed [LOC Turkey  ] 's formal acquiescence on the Declaration . 
[PER De Gooijer  ] said the [LOC Turks  ] were quibbling over words down to individual letters in the [MISC Conclusions  ] text . 
Worse , they refused to make the formal declaration as foreseen in the text of [ORG Paragraph  ] 19 , which welcomed it and supposedly quoted from it . 
By this time , [PER Erdogan  ] had apparently abandoned the negotiations and was heading back to the [LOC Conrad Hotel  ] for an already scheduled 2 p.m. news conference . 
[PER Balkenende  ] called PM [PER Blair  ] , [PER de Gooijer  ] said , and asked him to help . 
[PER Blair  ] volunteered to get in his car and go after [PER Erdogan  ] ; some time later , both men returned to the [ORG Council  ] building for the final round. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) At this point , [PER de Gooijer  ] said he proposed that [PER Erdogan  ] , [PER Balkenende  ] , and [ORG Barroso  ] sign the page from the newly issued draft [MISC Conclusions  ] on which the revised [ORG Paragraph  ] 19 stood , as a way of acknowledging agreement to its contents and intent . 
I just tore the page from my book and drew three lines at the bottom of it , [PER de Gooijer  ] recalled . 
[PER Erdogan  ] refused to sign , as did Gul . 
[PER De Gooijer  ] said that he then pointed out that someone from the political level would have to accept [ORG Paragraph  ] 19 in such a way that the rest of the [ORG Council  ] , especially [LOC Cyprus  ] , would be satisfied that [LOC Turkey  ] agreed to sign the Protocol before October 3 . 
Finally , [PER Erdogan  ] instructed his State Secretary to sign on behalf of [LOC Turkey  ] ; State Secretary [PER Arzo Nicolai  ] signed for the [MISC Dutch  ] , and Commissioner [PER Rehn  ] signed for the [ORG Commission  ] ; this paper was then copied and circulated to the [ORG Council  ] , [PER de Gooijer  ] said . 
With this , the men returned to the [ORG Council  ] , where representatives of the other three candidate states joined the 25 [ORG EU  ] Member States for a final session and the traditional family photograph. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) As an addendum , a [ORG Council  ] staffer who was note-taking for the final session told [ORG USEU  ] PolOff that things still remained tense even after the agreement was reached . 
In the final formal [ORG Council  ] session , the [MISC EU-25  ] , at the request of [LOC Greece  ] , had amended para 20 of the [MISC Conclusions  ] ( referring to resolution of border disputes ) so that it referred to Member States ( plural ) vice [ORG Member State  ] . 
When the four candidates joined the 25 for champagne toasts , after [MISC Romanian  ] , [MISC Bulgarian  ] and [MISC Croatian  ] remarks about the historic decisions , [PER Erdogan  ] took the floor . 
He , too , noted the historic nature of the day , but then offered two substantive comments . 
First , he said [LOC Turkey  ] understood para 20 to still be referring to one [ORG Member State  ] in particular . 
And second , the [MISC GoT  ] underlined that it did not view signing of the Protocol to the [ORG Ankara Agreement  ] as recognition of [LOC Cyprus  ] . 
( NOTE: [ORG USEU  ] 's source said [ORG Council  ] discussion had already made clear the [ORG EU  ] was not going to include such a point in the formal [MISC Conclusions  ] , but the [MISC Dutch  ] had agreed with the [LOC Turks  ] that , if the topic came up , [PER Balkenende  ] in the closing press conference would note that the [ORG EU  ] did not view the Protocol signing as being the same as recognition . 
) . 
[MISC Cypriot  ] President [PER Papadopoulos  ] responded to [PER Erdogan  ] that the [MISC Conclusions  ] were already agreed among the [MISC EU-25  ] and could not be rewritten post-facto . 
[PER Balkenende  ] , who [ORG USEU  ] 's source described as growing visibly twitchy , stepped in to say that all could agree that today had seen a historic decision , and brought the discussion to a welcome close. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) As for [LOC Turkey  ] 's Declaration ? 
It will forever be missing ; historians will search in vain for a paper since there never was one , [PER de Gooijer  ] said with a grin . 
It was the intent that counted . 
Summing up , [PER de Gooijer  ] said , We all know what [LOC Turkey  ] has to do , preferably sooner rather than later and certainly not as late as October 2 ( the day before negotiations are supposed to start ) . 
And if the [LOC Turks  ] come in and quibble over the Declaration and their intent as reflected in [ORG Paragraph  ] 19 ? 
The [ORG EU  ] would not start negotiations , [PER de Gooijer  ] concluded. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) This cable was coordinated with [ORG USEU  ] .
