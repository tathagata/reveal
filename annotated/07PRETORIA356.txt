[ORG Reason  ] s 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . 
( U ) This message has been coordinated with [ORG AmEmbassy Harare.  ] <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: Exiled [MISC Zimbabwean  ] businessmanXXXXXXXXXXXX is quietly floating an idea to shift executive power from President [PER Mugabe  ] to a “technocratic” Prime Minister . 
To get [PER Mugabe  ] to accept the deal , [PER Mugabe  ] would remain President until 2010 with some power over the security apparatus , but the Prime Minister would run the economy and get the country back on its feet . 
All parties would work together to draft a new constitution . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was open to ideas on who best to sell the plan , but suggested new [ORG UN  ] Secretary General [PER Ban Ki-moon  ] , working through an envoy like former [MISC Malaysian  ] PM [PER Mahathir  ] , as possible mediators . 
We cannot comment on the merits of the plan , but find it encouraging that senior [MISC Zimbabwean  ] exile businessmen are discussing solutions to their country’s political and economic crisis . 
[ORG Embassy Harare  ] notes that the concept is increasingly in circulation in [LOC Harare  ] and may not require outside intervention . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) A group of prominent [MISC Zimbabwean  ] businessmen living in [LOC South Africa  ] , led by [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , discussed with visiting [LOC NIO  ] for [LOC Africa  ] , [LOC PolCounselor  ] and PolOff January 27 a possible strategy for transferring executive power from President [PER Robert Mugabe  ] to a “technocratic” prime minister . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was joined by [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , and [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
The four businessmen agreed that there is a “window of opportunity” to bring positive change to [LOC Zimbabwe  ] , opened by the deteriorating economic situation and [MISC Mugabe’s  ] advancing age and declining health. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) XXXXXXXXXXXX’s strategy builds on the assumption that [PER Mugabe  ] will never voluntarily give up power . 
He fears for his future if he steps down -- citing the [PER Charles Taylor  ] example XXXXXXXXXXXX. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Under XXXXXXXXXXXX’s ( somewhat convoluted ) plan: -- [PER Mugabe  ] gets the extension of his presidential term to 2010 , but would share power with a “technocratic” Prime Minister during the 2007-10 period . 
-- The PM would have to be acceptable to 85 percent of the parliament , thus requiring opposition [ORG MDC  ] support , and could only be removed by an 85 percent vote in parliament . 
-- The President would still appoint the key security ministers of Defense , [ORG Home Affairs  ] , and [ORG National Security  ] . 
The PM would appoint the other cabinet members , particularly in the economic area . 
However , deployment of troops would require the approval of both the PM and President . 
-- The PM would not be eligible to run for President in 2010 , thus ensuring his or her political independence . 
-- Between 2007-10 , the Constitution and electoral system would be reviewed , and a new constitution put in place . 
-- In return for these “reforms , ” the international community would agree to the phased lifting of sanctions , the “acceptance” of the extension of [PER Mugabe  ] , s term to 2010 , and perhaps most importantly to provide economic assistance to help rehabilitate the [MISC Zimbabwean  ] economy. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that a number of [MISC Zimbabweans  ] could play the role of technocratic Prime Minister . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) On the question of who sells this plan to [PER Mugabe  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was open to ideas . 
He said that [PER Moeletsi Mbeki  ] , a [LOC PRETORIA  ] 00000356 002 OF 002 [MISC South African  ] businessman and ( estranged ) brother to the President , recommended against [LOC South Africa  ] playing the mediation role , arguing that [PER ForMin Dlamini-Zuma  ] is too close to [PER Mugabe  ] . 
[PER Moeletsi Mbeki  ] recommended involving the new [ORG UN  ] Secretary General [PER Ban Ki-moon  ] , working through an envoy like SIPDIS former [MISC Malaysian  ] Prime Minister [PER Mahathir.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) COMMENT: We cannot comment on whether [PER Mugabe  ] might accept a power-sharing plan like [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] proposes or who is best to convince [PER Mugabe  ] , but it is encouraging that four senior [MISC Zimbabwean  ] businessmen are actively discussing ideas to resolve their country’s political and economic crisis . 
For the last seven years , most exiled [MISC Zimbabwean  ] businessmen in [LOC South Africa  ] have avoided any political involvement in their home country . 
We are not as quick as [PER Moeletsi Mbeki  ] to dismiss a possible [MISC South African  ] role in any proposed transition deal , even if they are not the ones to sell it directly to [PER Mugabe  ] . 
The [MISC South African  ] Government is increasingly frustrated with [MISC Mugabe’s  ] intransigence and Zimbabwe’s economic decline , which impedes regional integration and growth ; President [PER Thabo Mbeki  ] wants to see [LOC Zimbabwe  ] “resolved” before he leaves power in 2009 ; and the last thing [LOC South Africa  ] wants while hosting the 2010 [MISC World Cup  ] is a messy and violent election in [LOC Zimbabwe  ] . 
END COMMENT. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG EMBASSY HARARE  ] COMMENT: The concept described by [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] is increasingly in circulation in [LOC Harare  ] . 
[PER Morgan Tsvangirai  ] told [PER Emboffs  ] on 30 January that this is [PER Mugabe  ] , s SIPDIS Plan B as he runs into growing resistance to 2010 and that the candidate for PM would be [PER Simba Makoni  ] . 
Significant outside intervention , therefore , may not be necessary ; however , gentle encouragement from [LOC Pretoria  ] is unlikely to be amiss . 
[ORG UN  ] SYG Ban may not wish to engage on this issue at the beginning of his tenure , especially in view of the way [PER Mugabe  ] treated former [ORG UN  ] SYG [PER Annan  ] . 
END EMBASSY [LOC HARARE  ] COMMENT .
