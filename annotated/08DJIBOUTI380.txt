( S ) SUMMARY . 
On April 20 , senior [MISC Djiboutian  ] officials--including [MISC Djibouti’s  ] defense minister , intelligence chief , and deputy [ORG CHOD--were  ] involved in talks with [MISC Eritrean  ] military officials in an attempt to defuse tensions arising from Eritrea’s establishment of a military outpost on disputed territory at [LOC Ras Doumeira  ] , along the [MISC Bab  ] al [MISC Mandab  ] strait . 
According to [MISC Djibouti’s  ] foreign minister , the [ORG GODJ  ] sought to use “quiet diplomacy” to press [LOC Eritrea  ] , although it believed that [MISC Eritrean  ] President [PER Isaias  ] was unpredictable , as evidenced by Eritrea’s 1994 attack on a [MISC Djiboutian  ] outpost at the same area . 
Foreign Minister [PER Youssouf  ] reports that [PER Isaias  ] opposes [MISC Djiboutian  ] efforts to broker discussions between [ORG Somalia’s Transitional Federal Government  ] ( [ORG TFG  ] ) and the Alliance for the [MISC Re-Liberation  ] of [LOC Somalia  ] ( [ORG ARS  ] ) , and that [PER Isaias  ] also suspects that routine [LOC U.S.  ] military exercises in [LOC Djibouti  ] are aimed at gathering intelligence for [LOC Ethiopia  ] . 
[PER Youssouf  ] said [LOC Djibouti  ] would welcome participating in the [ORG International Contact Group  ] on [LOC Somalia  ] , and planned to meet with visiting [ORG UN  ] SRSG for [LOC Somalia  ] [PER Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah  ] later in the week . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) On April 20 , Charge and [ORG GRPO  ] met with [MISC Djiboutian  ] Foreign Minister [PER Mahmoud Ali Youssouf  ] to discuss the GODJ’s April 17 complaint that [LOC Eritrea  ] had established a military outpost on [MISC Djiboutian  ] territory at [PER Doumeira  ] ( ref A ) . 
Charge and [ORG GRPO  ] were accompanied by two representatives of the Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of [LOC Africa  ] ( [MISC CJTF-HOA  ] ) : Embassy [ORG Djibouti Country Coordination Element  ] ( [ORG CCE  ] ) CDR [PER James Dickie  ] , and [MISC CJTF-HOA  ] Director of Intelligence ( [MISC CJ-2  ] ) CAPT [PER Kevin Frank.  ] --------------------------------------------- ------- [MISC FRENCH  ] IMAGERY SHOWS STRUCTURE ON DISPUTED TERRITORY --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) FM [PER Youssouf  ] presented low-resolution color photographs of [LOC Ras Doumeira  ] dated the afternoon of April 17 , which he said had been provided by [MISC French  ] authorities . 
The photos show a manned structure and several trucks at the base of a mountain ; according to FM [PER Youssouf  ] , the structure is an [MISC Eritrean  ] military post constructed recently on “no man’s land” along the easternmost portion of the border between [LOC Djibouti  ] and [LOC Eritrea  ] , along the [MISC Bab  ] al [MISC Mandab  ] strait. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) While [MISC Eritrean  ] forces had “pulled back” on the evening of April 19 , FM [PER Youssouf  ] expressed concern that an estimated 3,000 [MISC Eritrean  ] troops were along the [MISC Eritrean  ] border with [LOC Djibouti  ] , concentrated along three axes: from [LOC Eritrea  ] to the [MISC Djiboutian  ] border towns of [LOC Daddato  ] , [PER Sidiha Menguela  ] , and [ORG Bissidourou  ] . 
In addition to the post at [LOC Ras Doumeira  ] , [MISC Eritrean  ] forces had also recently built a coastal road from the port of [LOC Assab  ] to [LOC Doumeira  ] , and had begun to reclaim the waterfront , in an apparent attempt to construct some sort of port facility , he said. ----------------------------------- MIL-MIL TALKS UNDERWAY WITH [LOC ERITREA  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) In response to this “belligerent act , ” [PER Youssouf  ] said the [ORG GODJ  ] had strengthened its military presence at its base at [PER Moulhoule  ] ( 15 km south of [LOC Doumeira  ] ) . 
In addition , the [ORG GODJ  ] had dispatched a delegation on the morning of April 20 to [PER Moulhoule  ] , in order to discuss the incursion with [MISC Eritrean  ] officials . 
According to FM [PER Youssouf  ] , [ORG GODJ  ] representatives included Deputy Chief of the [ORG Djiboutian Armed Forces Brigadier General Zakaria Cheick Ibrahim  ] , [ORG National Security Service  ] ( [ORG NSS  ] ) Director [PER Hassan Said Khaireh  ] , and Defense Minister [PER Ogoureh Kiffleh Ahmed  ] . 
FM [PER Youssouf  ] said he had also been in direct contact personally with the [MISC Eritrean  ] [LOC Navy Commander  ] , [ORG Major General  ] [PER Karikare Ahmed Mohammed  ] , whom he believed had some influence on [MISC Eritrean  ] President [PER Isaias  ] . 
FM [PER Youssouf  ] also planned to engage the secretary-general of Eritrea’s foreign ministry , who was expected to transit [LOC Djibouti  ] airport ( from [LOC Dubai  ] ) on the evening of April 20. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) To satisfy the GODJ’s concerns , [MISC Eritrean  ] forces needed to withdraw at least 1 km away from the demarcated border at [LOC DJIBOUTI  ] 00000380 002 OF 002 [PER Mt. Doumeira  ] , [PER Youssouf  ] said ; adding that international law required pulling back to 5 km from the border. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) FM [PER Youssouf  ] noted that the [ORG GODJ  ] sought to utilize “quiet diplomacy” to defuse the situation , and had not yet issued any public statements on the recent [MISC Eritrean  ] incursion . 
However , he noted that the 1994 incident , which had involved an exchange of gunfire between [MISC Eritrean  ] and [MISC Djiboutian  ] forces at [LOC Ras Doumeira  ] , reached a denouement only when [LOC Djibouti  ] protested to the [ORG United Nations  ] , the [ORG Arab League  ] , and the [ORG African Union  ] . 
[LOC Djibouti  ] subsequently demarcated the border , while [LOC Eritrea  ] issued a map with altered boundaries for propaganda purposes. --------------------------------------------- ---------- [PER ISAIAS  ] “A LUNATIC” ; SUSPICIOUS OF [LOC ETHIOPIA  ] AND THE [LOC U.S.  ] --------------------------------------------- ---------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) The [MISC Eritrean  ] government ( [ORG GSE  ] ) was “very unpredictable , ” [PER Youssouf  ] said . 
He underscored that [MISC Eritrean  ] troops had previously attacked a [MISC Djiboutian  ] outpost at [LOC Ras Doumeira  ] in 1994 , at the same time that the [MISC Eritrean  ] foreign minister was visiting the capital of [LOC Djibouti  ] . 
Thus , according to [PER Youssouf  ] , [PER Isaias  ] had blindsided his own foreign minister. “This man is a lunatic , ” opined [PER Youssouf  ] , adding , “you can’t pick your neighbors.” [PER Youssouf  ] noted the scarcity of food and consumer goods in [LOC Eritrea  ] , caused by its “monopolistic , communist” state . 
As “waves of refugees” already crossed [MISC Djibouti’s  ] porous borders from [LOC Somalia  ] , [LOC Djibouti  ] could ill afford additional refugees from conflict between [LOC Ethiopia  ] and [LOC Eritrea.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) [PER Youssouf  ] said President [PER Isaias  ] had complained , at the last [LOC EU-Africa  ] summit in [LOC Lisbon  ] , that there was “no terrorism in [PER Djibouti.” Isaias  ] was deeply suspicious of [MISC Djiboutian  ] cooperation with the [LOC United States  ] , claiming even to have information on [ORG USG  ] renditions involving [LOC Djibouti  ] , [PER Youssouf  ] said . 
More recently , [ORG GSE  ] officials had expressed concern about both [LOC U.S.  ] military exercises in [LOC Djibouti  ] and also alleged [MISC Ethiopian  ] plans to attack [LOC Assab  ] from [LOC Bure  ] and to definitively remove [PER Isaias  ] from power . 
The [ORG GSE  ] had asserted that recent [LOC U.S.  ] military exercises in northern [LOC Djibouti  ] ( ref A ) were not intended to combat terror , but rather were intended to collect information for [LOC Ethiopia  ] , [PER Youssouf  ] said . 
[PER Youssouf  ] highlighted that the [ORG GODJ  ] was “happy” with the [LOC U.S.  ] presence in [LOC Djibouti  ] , and would continue to support the [LOC United States.  ] --------------------------------------------- ------- [LOC ERITREA  ] OPPOSED TO DJIBOUTIAN-BROKERED [LOC SOMALIA  ] TALKS --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) Recent business talks relating to the possible construction of a massive bridge linking [LOC Yemen  ] to [LOC Djibouti  ] had heightened [ORG GSE  ] interest in [LOC Doumeira  ] . 
The [ORG GSE  ] opposed [MISC Djibouti’s  ] ongoing efforts to broker discussions between [ORG Somalia’s Transitional Federal Government  ] ( [ORG TFG  ] ) and the Alliance for the [MISC Re-Liberation  ] of [LOC Somalia  ] ( [ORG ARS  ] ) ( ref B ) , [PER Youssouf  ] said , as the [ORG GSE  ] sought to keep [LOC Ethiopia  ] preoccupied in [LOC Somalia  ] , and thus to fracture the [MISC Ethiopian  ] military into 3-4 fronts . 
[PER Youssouf  ] said [LOC Djibouti  ] would welcome participating in the [ORG International Contact Group  ] on [LOC Somalia  ] , and planned to meet with visiting [ORG UN  ] SRSG for [LOC Somalia  ] [PER Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah  ] later in the week. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S ) COMMENT . 
FM [PER Youssouf  ] noted that no public statements from the [ORG USG  ] were needed yet , as [LOC Djibouti  ] sought to press [LOC Eritrea  ] through “quiet diplomacy.” Should these talks fail , however , the international community will have to weigh what actions , if any , would be effective in reversing the [MISC Eritrean  ] incursion . 
The recent withdrawal of [ORG UN  ] peacekeeping forces from the [ORG Temporary Security Zone  ] , following more than two years of increasing restrictions on the [ORG UN  ] Mission in [LOC Ethiopia  ] and [LOC Eritrea  ] ( [ORG UNMEE  ] ) , highlight the [MISC GSE’s  ] intransigence in the face of international pressure . 
END COMMENT .
