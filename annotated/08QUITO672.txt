She urged the [ORG GOE  ] to return to the private sector the television channels and other properties it had seized , which [PER Correa  ] and [PER Bustamante  ] assured her they planned to do . 
The Ambassador expressed concern that the new [ORG GOE  ] policy of not requiring visas for any nationality would allow many entrants then to travel illegally to the [LOC U.S.  ] Other subjects were the [ORG GOE  ] 's change agenda , [ORG Machala Power  ] , counternarcotics and military cooperation , and programs to assist the disabled . 
The Ambassador received a presidential award in recognition of her efforts to strengthen [MISC U.S.-Ecuadorian  ] relations . 
End Summary Seizure of [ORG Isaias' Properties  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The Ambassador emphasized to both President [PER Rafael Correa  ] and Government Minister [PER Fernando Bustamante  ] in separate meetings on July 17 the importance of resolving the dispute over properties the [ORG GOE  ] seized from [PER Roberto  ] and [PER William Isaias  ] , who are believed to have embezzled hundreds of millions of dollars in funds the [ORG GOE  ] provided their failing bank and then fled to the [LOC United States  ] ( reftels ) . 
Both [PER Correa  ] and [PER Bustamante  ] acknowledged the Ambassador 's concerns , agreeing that they did not have the skills to run the companies , and said that the [ORG GOE  ] plans to sell the properties that are confirmed to be property of the [PER Isaias  ] family . 
They explained the need first to allow time for appeals so current owners can demonstrate where they obtained funds to purchase the properties ; if they can show they are the legitimate owners and not just front people funneling profits back to the [PER Isaias  ] family , then the [ORG GOE  ] will return the properties. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The Ambassador particularly stressed that the two television channels need to be disposed of promptly . 
[PER Correa  ] said he understood the need to do so , noting that the [ORG GOE  ] might give one of them to depositors who are owed funds by the failed [MISC Isaias-owned  ] bank , Filanbanco . 
[PER Correa  ] expressed frustration that justice had not been done over the past ten years for so many [MISC Ecuadorians  ] who lost their savings while the [PER Isaias  ] family profited , saying that impunity had prevailed for far too long . 
[ORG Visa Policy  ] and Illegal Immigration <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The Ambassador expressed USG concern to Government Minister [PER Bustamante  ] about the [ORG GOE  ] decision not to require visas for nationals of any country . 
[PER Bustamante  ] replied that he also was concerned about this aspect , but that [PER Correa  ] was unlikely to change his mind on the subject . 
He stated that it was not the [ORG GOE  ] 's intention to allow [LOC Ecuador  ] to serve as a trampoline for those intending to immigrate to the [LOC United States  ] . 
[PER Bustamante  ] asked that the USG inform him if we have specific information about the entry of any individuals who are intending to travel illegally to the [LOC United States  ] . 
( Comment: We will follow up with [PER Bustamante  ] . 
) [ORG GOE Transformational Vision  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Correa  ] said that many [MISC Ecuadorians  ] were unable to understand the changes he was trying to bring about because they lack a sense of their responsibility to promote the common good and continue to promote narrow , personal agendas . 
Along with the usual frustration with the entrenched elite who refuse to acknowledge the injustice that has prevailed in [LOC Ecuador  ] , he expressed disappointment over indigenous leaders who he said were acting like " caudillos " in manipulating their constituencies , the same sort of rent-seeking behavior common among the [MISC Ecuadorian  ] elite . 
He mused philosophically about the greater success of [MISC Anglo-Saxon  ] societies in development compared to [MISC Latin  ] countries , attributing a large part of this difference to a sense of personal responsibility and an ability for self-criticism and correction that he feels is lacking in [LOC Ecuador  ] . 
He reiterated his desire to maintain a positive relationship with the [LOC United States.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Correa  ] said he was anxious that the [ORG Constituent Assembly  ] conclude . 
He noted that he had tried hard to get the [ORG Assembly  ] ( where the pro-government Proud and [LOC Sovereign Fatherland  ] , called PAIS , holds the majority ) to work on behalf of bigger principles . 
Nonetheless , many [ORG Assembly  ] members' small personal agendas ended up getting into the constitutional text . 
[PER Correa  ] was furious about language that had been inserted at the last minute that he thought made no sense , such as a prohibition on genetically-modified organisms. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S/NF ) [PER Bustamante  ] described what the [ORG GOE  ] is trying to accomplish as changing [LOC Ecuador  ] from a post-colonial society , where the elite only cared about themselves and their families on their big haciendas ( estates ) . 
He described what he saw as the extraordinary blindness of [LOC Ecuador  ] 's traditional ruling class not to care about the rest of the society , saying he was now in the government to try to ensure attention to the needs of the entire society . 
[PER Bustamante  ] pointed to the tremendous fear of change among the [MISC Ecuadorian  ] elite , even if they are not actually being harmed , because they no longer feel they can manage the government . 
He suggested that they would only get over this fear with time , when they see that the [PER Correa  ] administration 's actions do not adversely affect their interests . 
[PER Bustamante  ] expressed an awareness of the importance of avoiding an overly intrusive state , referring to the [ORG GOE  ] 's new wiretap program and the need to ensure advance judicial authorization . 
Business Relations , [MISC Counternarcotics  ] and [ORG Military Cooperation  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The Ambassador thanked [PER Correa  ] for meeting with representatives of [ORG Machala Power  ] and encouraged him to expeditiously resolve their lingering issues . 
( [ORG Note: Machala Power  ] is a [LOC U.S.  ] electricity company owed back payments by [ORG GOE  ] entities ; it would likely invest further if the [ORG GOE  ] made the payments . 
) [PER Correa  ] assured her that it was a " win-win " proposition that had unfortunately dragged on too long . 
He noted that he had given his team a deadline to come up with a solution. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The Ambassador raised with [PER Bustamante  ] the problems the embassy had with obtaining approval for entry of products that are destined to assist the [ORG GOE  ] , such as vehicles for the police . 
While joking that perhaps the embassy should buy [ORG General Motors  ] vehicles made in [LOC Ecuador  ] , [PER Bustamante  ] took the problem seriously and offered his assistance. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) During a July 17 call by Armed Forces Commander General [PER Fabian Varela  ] , the Ambassador expressed concern that Defense Minister [PER Ponce  ] intended to reduce training programs and other cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] military . 
[PER Varela  ] said that increasing military ties with other countries did not need to mean reducing cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] , and that , while he did not believe cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] would in fact be diminished , if [PER Ponce  ] moved to limit ties with the [LOC U.S.  ] military he would oppose it . 
[ORG Presidential Award and Assistance  ] to Disabled <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( SBU ) As an indication of the President [PER Correa  ] 's personal regard for the Ambassador and his appreciation of the importance of [LOC Ecuador  ] 's relationship with the [LOC United States  ] , [PER Correa  ] decided to bestow on the Ambassador the [ORG National Order of Merit  ] " [PER Honorato Vasquez  ] " at the level of the [LOC Great Cross  ] . 
FM [PER Maria Isabel Salvador  ] presented the award in a July 16 ceremony attended by five [ORG GOE  ] cabinet members , other senior [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] officials , and representatives of the diplomatic corps . 
In offering the toast at the luncheon that followed , Coordinating Minister for Internal and [ORG External Security  ] [PER Gustavo Larrea  ] emphasized [LOC Ecuador  ] 's friendship with the [LOC United States  ] and highlighted our bilateral cooperation. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Vice President [PER Lenin Moreno  ] expressed heartfelt appreciation to the Ambassador July 15 for [PER USAID  ] 's work to improve the opportunities available to disabled [MISC Ecuadorians  ] . 
He indicated a clear understanding of the importance of [MISC U.S.-Ecuador  ] friendship and cooperation in this and many other fields .
