End Summary . 
[MISC JORDANIAN  ] VIEWS ON REGIME DYNAMICS 2 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) During a September 13 meeting with Pol/Econ Chief , Embassy of [LOC Jordan  ] 's [ORG DCM  ] , [PER Nash'at  ] al-Hadid , characterized the [MISC Libyan  ] regime as opaque and complicated . 
He shared his personal opinion that [MISC Libyan  ] Leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] is the ultimate decision maker in [LOC Libya  ] . 
He observed that while foreign governments attempt to influence [PER Qadhafi  ] 's decisions through [ORG MFA  ] and other contacts - naming Protocol Chief and [PER Qadhafi  ] confidante [PER Nuri al-Mismari  ] in particular - the diplomatic community must recognize that the Leader is unpredictable and will ultimately do whatever he wants . 
3 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) Addressing local rumors about succession , [PER Hadid  ] confided that the [MISC Jordanians  ] viewed [PER Qadhafi  ] 's second eldest son , [PER Saif  ] al [MISC Islam  ] al-Qadhafi , as his most likely successor . 
[PER Hadid  ] characterized [PER Saif  ] al [MISC Islam  ] as open minded and reformist . 
[PER Hadid  ] saw [PER Saif  ] 's involvement in repatriating convicted [MISC Pan Am 103  ] bomber [PER Abdel Basset  ] al-Megrahi as a move to gain popularity after months of remaining outside of the political limelight . 
He viewed [PER Qadhafi  ] 's subsequent meeting with [PER Megrahi  ] as a father 's move to push back on his son 's overstepping . 
4 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) By contrast , [PER Hadid  ] viewed [PER Qadhafi  ] 's other potential successor , son [PER Muatassim Bilal  ] al-Qadhafi , as occupying a more powerful position than [PER Saif  ] . 
He said that [PER Muatassim  ] 's official position as [ORG National Security Advisor  ] gave him a stronger platform from which to jockey for succession . 
[PER Hadid  ] saw [PER Muatassim  ] as being more strongly supported by [LOC Libya  ] 's old guard regime stalwarts than [PER Saif  ] , although [PER Hadid  ] also characterized [PER Muatassim  ] as gradually liberalizing his public views on opening [LOC Libya  ] to [MISC Western  ] partnerships . 
[ORG JORDAN-LIBYAN RELATIONS  ] 5 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [PER Hadid  ] described [LOC Jordan  ] 's relationship as fitful and complicated . 
He recalled the brief severing of ties after the 1986 burning of [LOC Jordan  ] 's embassy in [LOC Tripoli  ] and stated that while the current bilateral relationship was limited , it was better than it had been in the past and on the right track . 
[ Note: According to [PER Hadid  ] , the [MISC Jordanian  ] Embassy was torched after the [LOC U.S.  ] bombing of [LOC Libya  ] in 1986 because King [PER Hussein  ] was traveling in the [LOC United States  ] at the time of the operation . 
The embassy was rebuilt approximately six years later . 
End Note . 
] [PER Hadid  ] said that [LOC Jordan  ] and [LOC Libya  ] differed on political issues - namely , [LOC Libya  ] 's stance on the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] peace process and a two-state solution - but their commercial relationship was growing . 
[PER Hadid  ] stated that several bilateral commercial agreements were signed in June during PM [PER Nader Dahabi  ] 's visit to [LOC Tripoli  ] , however the [MISC Jordanians  ] have not been impressed by the pace of [LOC Libya  ] 's actions to implement the agreements . 
According to the agreements , [PER Hadid  ] explained , the Government of [LOC Libya  ] was supposed to provide more commercial opportunities for [MISC Jordanians  ] - in construction , engineering , and consulting - but those opportunities have been slow in coming . 
He complained about the [ORG GOL  ] 's tendency ( and that of [PER Qadhafi  ] in particular ) to sign agreements for the sake of announcing them publicly rather than a commitment to the principles and stipulations of those agreements . 
Nevertheless , [MISC Jordanians  ] enjoy limited commercial investment and employment opportunities in [LOC Libya  ] . 
[PER Hadid  ] said that while low salaries in the service sector turn [MISC Jordanians  ] away from employment opportunities in [LOC Libya  ] , a relatively small number of [MISC Jordanians  ] work in healthcare and education . 
KING ABDULLAH'S SHORT VISIT 6 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) Regarding King [PER Abdullah  ] 's attendance at [PER Qadhafi  ] 's 40th anniversary events in celebration of the latter 's 1969 coup , [PER Hadid  ] explained that the [MISC Jordanian  ] monarch only stayed in [LOC Tripoli  ] for a few hours on September 1 . 
He arrived around 1700 local time and left before the [MISC Iftar  ] meal was served ( around 2000-2100 local time ) . 
[PER Hadid  ] said that King [PER Abdullah  ] stopped in [LOC Tripoli  ] on his way to [LOC Morocco  ] to visit [MISC Saudi  ] Prince Sultan . 
[LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000759 002.2 OF 002 [PER Hadid  ] confirmed that the King did not have a private bilateral meeting with [PER Qadhafi  ] . 
7 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) Comment: [LOC Jordan  ] is one of a handful of influential [MISC Middle Eastern  ] countries that enjoys a substantive relationship with [LOC Libya  ] . 
While the two countries differ on high-profile political issues , namely [LOC Middle East  ] peace , [LOC Jordan  ] 's commercial interests in [LOC Libya  ] may be able to establish a foundation for expanded bilateral political engagement . 
King [PER Abdullah  ] 's short stop in [LOC Tripoli  ] may have been intended to remind [PER Qadhafi  ] of his commercial commitments to [LOC Jordan  ] and will likely further ingratiate [LOC Jordan  ] with the [MISC Libyan  ] Leader . 
[LOC Jordan  ] 's views on regime dynamics and succession agree with those expressed by many [MISC Western  ] diplomats in [LOC Tripoli  ] .
