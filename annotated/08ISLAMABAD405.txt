End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Ambassador and Polcouns January 25 paid a condolence and introductory call on [PER Asif Ali Zardari  ] , widower of [PER Benazir Bhutto  ] and Co-Chairman of the [ORG Pakistan People’s Party  ] ( [ORG PPP  ] ) . 
The meeting at [LOC Bilawal House  ] in [LOC Karachi  ] lasted an hour and a half . 
[PER Roukhsana Bangash  ] took notes for [PER Zardari  ] ; [ORG PPP  ] Sindhi President [PER Nisar Ahmad Khuro  ] also attended the meeting . 
Wearing a western blazer and slacks , [PER Zardari  ] appeared relaxed and focused through a wide-ranging discussion , referring only once to his prepared notes. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Ambassador expressed condolences over the death of [PER Benazir Bhutto  ] and recounted how she had first met [PER Bhutto  ] just a few months ago in the same room . 
She asked about the [PER Bhutto  ] children , and [PER Zardari  ] said that [PER Bilawal  ] , in particular , was being besieged by well-meaning but stressful requests to attend memorials or speak to the press . 
[PER Bilawal  ] wanted to come home for his school holidays , but [PER Zardari  ] was still considering what was best . 
He had just visited the daughters in [LOC Dubai  ] . 
[PER Zardari  ] himself planned to live at least part time in [LOC Lahore  ] after the mourning period was completed. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Zardari  ] opened his remarks by saying that the [LOC U.S.  ] is “our safety blanket” and recounted how [PER Benazir  ] had returned despite the threats against her because of support and “clearance” from the [LOC U.S.  ] However , [PER Zardari  ] quickly moved on to the [ORG PPP  ] succession . 
He shared a photocopy of a one-page handwritten will from [PER Benazir  ] in which she bequeathed the party to him . 
This document , [PER Zardari  ] said , would be published in an upcoming book authored by [PER Benazir  ] . 
[PER Zardari  ] said that for symbolic reasons he passed the [ORG PPP  ] leadership to his son , [PER Bilawal  ] . 
Although [PER Bilawal  ] was only 19 , [PER Zardari  ] noted that [PER Benazir  ] had taken over the [ORG PPP  ] when she was only 22 years old . 
[MISC Benazir’s  ] enemies , he said , do not understand that she is now even stronger as a martyr . 
[ORG Taliban Threat  ] -------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The challenge today , said [PER Zardari  ] , was to convert [MISC Benazir’s  ] energy and the sympathy from her death into a positive outcome for [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
He warned that what happens in [LOC Pakistan  ] has a spillover effect in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , and [LOC India  ] . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] has a population of 175 million people that is growing at 3-4% per year , so the effect of talibanization here can have a profound impact on the entire region. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) According to [PER Zardari  ] , there was no such thing as a “moderate [MISC Taliban”  ] which had warped the concept of [MISC Islam  ] . 
[PER Zardari  ] expressed concern about the increasing level of [MISC Saudi  ] money even in [LOC Sindh  ] and said that mosques and madrassas had become a “cottage industry” in [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
It was important to reverse the impact of former President General [PER Zia’s Islamization  ] , and he noted that in helping the mujahideen fight the [MISC Soviets  ] we had “taught people to fish” and were now reaping the consequences . 
Ambassador noted that [PER Benazir  ] , more than most [MISC Pakistani  ] politicians , had understood the creeping threat of extremism . 
That threat was now exhibiting itself , not only in the tribal areas , but in the settled areas of [LOC Swat  ] and through suicide bombings around the country . 
Planning to [LOC Run  ] --------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Zardari  ] agreed , saying that democracy was the way [LOC ISLAMABAD  ] 00000405 002 OF 004 forward . 
He had opposed former Prime Minister [PER Nawaz Sharif’s  ] announcement ( twice ) of a boycott and had not launched a [ORG FIR  ] ( first incident report ) against the government over [MISC Benazir’s  ] death . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] did not need any more chaos . 
[PER Zardari  ] said he would support [ORG PPP  ] participation even if the party was weak or he was not in parliament . 
[PER Zardari  ] volunteered that the [ORG PPP  ] had not yet chosen any candidate for Prime Minister and said it was premature at this stage . 
He noted that his sister is a member of the [ORG National Assembly  ] from [LOC Nawabshah  ] , and said she could give up her seat within two months so that he could contest it . 
[PER Zardari  ] was struggling , however , with how to explain to [ORG PPP  ] rank and file the idea of continuing to work with a superpower which supported [MISC Musharraf  ] . 
He was trying to convince his party that the [LOC U.S.  ] supported democracy. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Ambassador responded that the [LOC U.S.  ] most definitely is supporting the democratic process in [LOC Pakistan  ] and believes that , as the broadest based party in [LOC Pakistan  ] , the [ORG PPP  ] must be part of that process . 
We were working to make the elections as free and fair as possible . 
It did not go unnoticed in [LOC Washington  ] that [PER Zardari  ] had agreed to a delay in elections and publicly had spoken out against violence . 
Call in the [ORG Army  ] ---------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) In response , [PER Zardari  ] ticked off the litany of [ORG PPP  ] complaints about the election process: the intelligence agencies were going to rig the voting ; the caretaker government was a sham and the former [MISC Musharraf  ] government effectively was still in place at the national and provincial levels ; [ORG PPP  ] workers were being falsely arrested on charges connected to the post-assassination riots in [LOC Sindh  ] ; and the Chief Election Commissioner was weak and took his power from a [ORG Supreme Court  ] that has now been hand-picked by [PER Musharraf.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) What was needed , [PER Zardari  ] believed , was to have the [LOC Pakistan  ] [ORG Army  ] deployed at all voting places on election day to supervise the process . 
He was appealing to Chief of [ORG Army Staff  ] General [PER Kayani  ] , Prime Minister [PER Soomro  ] and the Election Commission to put a solider in every polling booth on election day . 
Ambassador cautioned that in a recent meeting with [ORG CENTCOM Commander  ] Admiral [ORG Fallon  ] , General [PER Kayani  ] had made it clear that the [ORG Army  ] wanted to stay out of politics . 
[PER Zardari  ] responded “out of politics , yes but not out of security for the process.” There was precedent from former Prime Minister [PER Nawaz Sharif’s  ] era to deploy the [ORG Army  ] . 
It was needed to stop intimidation of voters by the local gangs belonging to some ruling party elites ( he cited the [ORG Chaudhrys  ] in the [LOC Punjab  ] ) . 
[PER Zardari  ] said that the ruling party controls the police and could easily throw out the poll watchers so the process can be rigged. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Noting that many western officials would see deployment of the [ORG Army  ] as a negative development , Ambassador pressed [PER Zardari  ] on this point . 
He confirmed that the [ORG PPP  ] believed the [ORG Army  ] was a national institution that could be counted upon to preserve security and prevent electoral fraud . 
However , [PER Zardari  ] admitted that he was “scared” that the closer he gets to General [PER Kayani  ] , the weaker [PER Kayani  ] will become . 
[ORG Bhutto Investigation  ] -------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Zardari  ] confirmed that [ORG PPP  ] officials were in the [LOC U.S.  ] to push for a [ORG UN  ] investigation of [PER Benazir Bhutto’s  ] assassination . 
He was not interested so much in who the sniper was or exactly how [PER Benazir  ] was killed . 
This was not as important as finding out who financed the killing , who were the “hands behind” it . 
[PER Zardari  ] had met with [ORG Scotland Yard  ] as a courtesy , and the [ORG PPP  ] provided some assistance , but the [ORG Scotland Yard  ] mandate did not extend to what the [ORG PPP  ] wanted to know . 
Ambassador said that we believed [PER Baitullah Mehsud  ] was responsible ; [PER Zardari  ] dismissed this by saying that [PER Mehsud  ] was “just a pawn” in the process. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Ambassador noted that our experience with the [PER Hariri  ] investigation was not promising ; after three and a half years and great expense , there was still no final verdict . 
Moreover , it would still require an investigative body , and the [ORG UN  ] had to pull together a disparate group of [LOC ISLAMABAD  ] 00000405 003 OF 004 law enforcement officials and prosecutors to actually conduct the investigation . 
We believed it was important to hear the results of the [ORG Scotland Yard  ] investigation before considering any other inquiries . 
Post-Election Alliances ----------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) In response to [MISC Ambassador’s  ] question , [PER Zardari  ] said he could work with the [ORG Pakistan Muslim League  ] ( [ORG PML  ] ) as “they were not all bad.” He cited former Foreign Minister [PER Kasuri  ] as an example of someone with whom he could interact . 
The [ORG Chaudhrys  ] continued to issue false campaign statements and unnecessarily stir up [MISC Sindhi-Punjabi  ] emotions , but [PER Zardari  ] insisted he had been careful “not to name names” or close out options . 
He continued to talk to [ORG National Security Advisor  ] [PER Tariq Aziz  ] and confirmed that [PER Aziz  ] wants them to meet in [LOC Islamabad  ] . 
[PER Zardari  ] also confirmed meeting with [ORG ISI Director General Taj.  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) As for other party politicians , [PER Zardari  ] described [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] as a shy man . 
He had welcomed [MISC Nawaz’s  ] condolence visit to [LOC Sindh  ] , although he recounted that [PER Nawaz  ] had put him in jail on false charges . 
Still , given the history of [PER Zulfakir Bhutto’s  ] death , the [ORG PPP  ] doesn’t “condemn or hang former prime ministers.” [PER Zardari  ] dismissed the electoral prospects of [PER Fazlur Rehman  ] , leader of the [ORG Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam  ] party , by saying [PER Fazlur  ] was afraid for his life , hiding out on a pilgrimage to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
[PER Zardari  ] questioned whether the [ORG Muttahida Quami Movement  ] ( [ORG MQM  ] ) really had the support of more than 20% of [LOC Karachi  ] , but said that it ruled through gerrymandering of districts . 
The same was true of the [MISC PML’s  ] support in [LOC Punjab  ] . 
[PER Zardari  ] said he didn’t like the aggressive side of [ORG MQM  ] but could work with the party and wanted to form a “national unity” government to heal the country . 
Economic Policy --------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [PER Zardari  ] lamented that , despite economic growth , [PER Musharraf  ] had wasted an opportunity to improve social conditions in [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
The country had received $62 billion in international assistance since September 11 , 2001 , but it wasn’t clear what the government had done with the money . 
There was a $6 billion shortfall , and poverty had increased. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) Ambassador said that we shared the same concern . 
In particular , funds we provided for the military were not reaching the forces who needed them to fight extremism . 
She noted that there was some concern that PPP’s traditionally populist ideas might undermine sound economic policy . 
[PER Zardari  ] responded that he supported increased privatization and economic expansion to build the middle class . 
The [ORG PPP  ] , he insisted , had evolved beyond the days of [PER Zulfakir Bhutto’s  ] slogans to give the people “roti , kapra , makan” ( bread , clothing , shelter ) . 
Request for Endorsement ----------------------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) In closing , [PER Zardari  ] said flatly “I am not [PER Benazir  ] , and I know it . 
The people respect me only because I spent eleven years in prison.” Therefore , “I need help , especially from the [LOC U.S.”  ] to continue her legacy . 
Ambassador responded that we continued to support the [ORG PPP  ] and our shared struggle against extremism and in favor of the democratic process in [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
Comment ------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) [PER Zardari  ] had prepared for this meeting and knew what his audience wanted to hear . 
Nevertheless , he was calm , articulate and demonstrated a good grasp of issues and politics . 
Missing was the egotism and emotional bombast that we expected . 
He referred to conspiracy theories far less than [PER Benazir  ] had done and appears ready to deal with a variety of political actors in a practical way . 
Zardari’s decision to name his son as head of the party was a savvy recognition of his own negatives , and it demonstrated a deliberate willingness to continue exploiting the [ORG Bhutto  ] name . 
By sharing a copy of what purportedly was [ORG Benazir’s ISLAMABAD  ] 00000405 004 OF 004 will ( it has not been shared with the public despite numerous media requests ) , [PER Zardari  ] appeared to be trying to convince us that [PER Benazir  ] indeed had anointed him as her successor. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) [PER Zardari  ] seemingly wants to be the PPP’s candidate for Prime Minister , with the [ORG USG  ] blessing . 
Law is not necessarily an obstacle to politics in [LOC Pakistan  ] ; however , the law requires that candidates have a university degree to run for office , and the [ORG Election Commission  ] has disqualified the [PER Sharif  ] brothers ( and other candidates ) for being convicted/accused of crimes . 
[PER Zardari  ] has no university degree and spent eleven years in prison on various charges ranging from corruption and extortion to murder . 
He benefited from the [ORG National Reconciliation Ordinance  ] ( [ORG NRO  ] ) that gave [PER Benazir  ] and others immunity from prosecution , but the [ORG NRO  ] is due to expire on February 4 . 
In deciding whether to extend the [ORG NRO  ] , [PER Musharraf  ] thus has leverage over [PER Zardari  ] , his candidate eligibility , and his possible role in a future government. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
Within [ORG PPP  ] party circles , there is still a great deal of suspicion and dislike of [PER Zardari  ] . 
For now , most [ORG PPP  ] members are lining up behind him as party leader . 
The focus of infighting has been over who , other than [PER Zardari  ] , will be the [ORG PPP  ] candidate for Prime Minister . 
If [PER Zardari  ] presses his own candidacy , he will place further strains on a party that already is showing signs of fracture . 
As for running in his sister’s constituency , it is not clear if the government will schedule by-elections until several months ( possibly not before June ) after the February 18 elections . 
At a minimum , it still appears that the [ORG PPP  ] will need another candidate for Prime Minister if and until [PER Zardari  ] can sort out his eligibility. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) The government already has announced that the [ORG Army  ] will be stationed at “sensitive” polling places to maintain law and order on election day . 
A wholesale deployment of the [ORG Army  ] designed to prevent vote rigging by the [PER Musharraf  ] government , however , could very much politicize the [ORG Army  ] in a way that General [PER Kayani  ] has been seeking to avoid . 
It would also place additional duties on forces increasingly overstretched in dealing with extremist militants in and around the tribal areas . 
Politically , however , the call for [ORG Army  ] deployment is a clever move that puts the government in a no-win position , especially if/when election-day violence breaks out .
