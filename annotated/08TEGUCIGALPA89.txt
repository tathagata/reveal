[ORG TEGUCIGALPA  ] 84 ( [ORG NOTAL  ] ) Classified By: Ambassador [PER Charles Ford  ] , reasons ( b , c & d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
[PER Summary:  ] During his January 16 visit to [LOC Honduras  ] , sources tell us that [LOC Venezuela  ] President [PER Hugo Chavez  ] asked [MISC Honduran  ] President [PER Zelaya  ] to either remove the [ORG Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia  ] ( [ORG FARC  ] ) from any terrorist lists or publicly acknowledge it as not being a terrorist organization . 
As the [ORG GOH  ] has no official " terrorist lists " the announcement was made January 28 via a " leaked " press article . 
We believe [PER Chavez  ] may have also asked [PER Zelaya  ] to sign onto the [ORG Bolivarian Alternative  ] for the [ORG Americas  ] ( [ORG ALBA  ] ) or at least send a representative to the Sixth annual [MISC ALBA Summit  ] starting on January 25 . 
[PER Zelaya  ] sent his outgoing Foreign Minister [PER Milton Jimenez  ] , who claimed his mission was to finalize [ORG Petrocaribe  ] , but who sat in on all the [ORG ALBA  ] meetings and was acknowledged by [PER Chavez  ] as an official observer . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) According to sources within the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] ( [ORG MFA  ] ) , during his January 16 visit to [LOC Honduras  ] ( ref a ) [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Hugo Chavez  ] asked President [PER Manuel Zelaya  ] to either remove the [ORG FARC  ] from any terrorist lists or publicly acknowledge it as not being a terrorist organization . 
We understood from our contacts that [PER Zelaya  ] was asking the [ORG Ministries of Defense  ] , Security and [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] to give him their opinions on this issue before he made a final decision . 
The issue then went public before any internal discussions could apparently be held . 
In an article in the conservative [ORG El Heraldo  ] on January 28 , the headline read " The [ORG FARC  ] is not on any [MISC Honduran  ] Terrorist Lists . 
" In the article , Vice Foreign Minister [PER Enrique Reina  ] is quoted as saying the [ORG GOH  ] has condemned all terrorist attacks , but that in the case of [LOC Colombia  ] , they regard the [ORG FARC  ] as an internal matter that the [MISC Colombians  ] need to resolve . 
He added that the [ORG GOH  ] approaches the matter multilaterally and regionally , through the joint security policy of the System for [MISC Central American  ] Integration ( [ORG SICA  ] ) . 
The article was followed by an " urgent " diplomatic note sent to [ORG Embassy  ] in which these points were reiterated . 
The [ORG MFA  ] Director of [ORG External Affairs  ] , [PER Eduardo Rosales Ramirez  ] , denied that these pronouncements were made in response to a request by [PER Chavez  ] , and confirmed that the [ORG MFA  ] does not have its own list of terrorist organizations , but bases its actions on both the [ORG UN  ] and [ORG USG  ] lists . 
[PER Rosales  ] also accused [ORG El Heraldo  ] ( which is owned by [PER Jorge Canahuati  ] , who is most closely aligned with the [MISC Nationalist  ] party ) of maliciously creating a story to damage the [PER Zelaya  ] administration. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Sources tell us that when Chief of Defense [PER Romeo Vasquez Velasquez  ] was asked his opinion on the issue , [PER Vasquez  ] said that since the [ORG FARC  ] does not threaten [MISC Honduras'  ] borders , it is considered an internal threat and not a terrorist organization . 
But when approached directly on January 28 , [PER Vasquez  ] told [MISC A/DAO  ] that " Your ( the [ORG USG  ] ) terrorist list is our terrorist list , " adding that the [ORG HOAF  ] does not work from the [ORG UN  ] lists and does not maintain its own list . 
[PER Vasquez  ] was upset that the press had published the article , saying the editors had done it purposely to stir up trouble with the [LOC United States.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [MISC Comment: Although  ] flat out denied by [ORG MFA  ] sources , we still suspect that [PER Chavez  ] asked [PER Zelaya  ] to make a pronouncement in support of the [ORG FARC  ] in return for his concessional [ORG Petrocaribe  ] deal ( ref b ) . 
In addition , we believe [PER Chavez  ] asked [PER Zelaya  ] to send a representative to the Sixth [MISC ALBA Summit  ] if he was serious about getting a [ORG Petrocaribe  ] deal . 
So on January 25 , FM [PER Milton Jimenez  ] flew to [LOC Venezuela  ] and participated in the summit as an official observer . 
We doubt it is mere coincidence that [PER Chavez  ] did not sign the draft [ORG Petrocaribe  ] deal until the conclusion of the [ORG ALBA  ] summit , when he could have signed it during his January 16 visit ( ref B ) . 
End Comment .
