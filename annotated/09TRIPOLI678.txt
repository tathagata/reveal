REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary . 
[ORG Qadhafi International Charity and Development Foundation  ] Executive Director [PER Yusuf Sawani  ] discussed with the Charge and Pol/Econ Chief the foundation 's human rights work , its overall workplan , and preparations for its annual youth rally August 20 . 
He stated unequivocally that [ORG Saif  ] would not attend the youth rally , but noted that he may broadcast remarks via satellite from [LOC Europe  ] . 
[ Note: Other reporting indicates that [ORG Saif  ] does/does plan to return to [LOC Tripoli  ] around August 20 . 
] He confirmed that [ORG Saif  ] al-Islam 's new satellite TV station , " [MISC Al Mutawasat/The Mediterranean  ] , " would begin broadcasting from the [LOC UK  ] on August 20 . 
[PER Sawani  ] claimed not to know whether [ORG Saif  ] planned to return to [LOC Tripoli  ] for the 40th anniversary of his father 's coup and insisted that that although [ORG Saif  ] was involved in the government 's " rehabilitation " efforts of [ORG Libyan Islamic Fighting Group  ] members , he would continue to operate outside of the official political sphere . 
[PER Sawani  ] did not comment on [ORG Saif  ] 's recent 1.5 million pound sterling donation to the Center for the [ORG Study of Global Governance  ] at the [ORG London School of Economics  ] . 
[PER Sawani  ] 's comments on [ORG Saif  ] 's interest in repatriating [PER Abdel Basset  ] al-Megrahi were reported in ref [PER A. End  ] Summary . 
2 . 
( C ) In an August 16 meeting with Charge and Pol/Econ Chief , [PER Yusuf Sawani  ] , the Executive Director of [ORG Saif  ] al-Islam 's [ORG Qadhafi International Charity and Development Foundation  ] ( [ORG QDF  ] ) , commended the [LOC U.S.  ] initiative to launch a bilateral [ORG Human Rights Dialogue  ] , noting that [ORG Saif  ] had recommended during his November 2008 visit to [LOC Washington  ] the establishment of a joint commission to investigate and report on bilateral human rights issues ( ref B ) . 
[PER Sawani  ] said that [ORG Saif  ] thought it was necessary to orient the [MISC Libyan  ] Government toward areas where it should focus its attention , including human rights , via direct discussions between the nations . 
[PER Sawani  ] thought the bilateral [ORG Human Rights Dialogue  ] would be a valuable mechanism for minimizing areas of disagreement and encouraging transparency within the relationship . 
3 . 
( C ) Regarding the recent statement of objectives that [ORG QDF  ] distributed the week of August 10 , [PER Sawani  ] noted that the three issue areas highlighted in the statement were ongoing projects for the Foundation that it intended to bring to completion in the short-term . 
Those areas include: work to complete compensation payments to families of those killed in the [LOC Abu Salim  ] prison riots ; assistance to families affected by [LOC Libya  ] 's participation in [LOC Chad  ] 's civil war and demining efforts in [LOC Chad  ] ; and work on the release and repatriation of convicted [MISC Pan Am 103  ] bomber [PER Abdel Basset  ] al-Megrahi ( ref A ) . 
[PER Sawani  ] set a deadline of June 2010 for completion of compensation payments to families of those killed at [LOC Abu Salim  ] prison . 
Noting that demonstrations still take place at the prison site , he explained that [ORG QDF  ] was working to obtain government permission to demolish the prison in order for resolution to be achieved . 
Similarly , he said that [ORG QDF  ] wanted the government to be involved and do more to push forward [ORG QDF  ] 's efforts in [LOC Chad  ] . 
[ORG QDF  ] will establish a new charitable organization to lead its efforts to provide social services -- basic health services , education , clean water -- to the hundreds of [MISC Libyan  ] families affected by [LOC Libya  ] 's involvement in the [MISC Chadian  ] civil war ( i.e. , the families of [MISC Libyan  ] soldiers who died for the cause ) . 
He stated that the [ORG GOL  ] had designated an office within the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] to address the needs of the [MISC Libyan  ] families , which he called corrupt and incompetent . 
Through the [ORG QDF  ] affiliate " [ORG Demining Society  ] , " the Foundation also plans to continue to support demining efforts in [LOC Chad  ] . 
[PER Sawani  ] noted that work had already been done in the valley of [LOC Ojanga  ] and will continue in the [PER Wadi Edoom  ] valley . 
4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Sawani  ] was notably reticent in response to our inquiries about plans for [ORG QDF  ] 's annual youth rally . 
He said that [ORG Saif  ] would not return to [LOC Libya  ] to speak at the August 20 rally , as he was busy vacationing in [LOC London  ] or [LOC Vienna  ] ( [PER Sawani  ] claimed not to know ) and also was preoccupied with his new ( undefined ) role at the Center for [ORG Global Governance  ] at the [ORG London School of Economics  ] . 
[ Note: Other reporting and Embassy political and economic contacts with independent relations to [ORG QDF  ] have indicated that [ORG Saif  ] will return to [LOC Libya  ] on/around August 20 . 
End Note . 
] [PER Sawani  ] agreed with local reports estimating that 100,000 youth are expected to attend the [ORG QDF  ] youth rally . 
He confirmed that the rally will take place in [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
The opening of youth day will also coincide with the launching of [ORG Saif  ] 's latest media channel - " [MISC Al Mutawasat/The Mediterranean  ] , " which will begin broadcasting from [LOC London  ] August 20 . 
[PER Sawani  ] mentioned that [ORG Saif  ] may broadcast remarks via satellite , perhaps using his new television channel -- or [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000678 002.2 OF 002 perhaps not -- to deliver his annual message to [LOC Libya  ] 's youth . 
He said the youth rally program would include distribution of gifts , such as computers , to attendees . 
When asked whether [ORG Saif  ] would return for the 40th anniversary of his father 's revolution , [PER Sawani  ] claimed not to know . 
He took the opportunity to emphasize that [ORG Saif  ] had no intention of returning to political life . 
5 . 
( C ) [PER Sawani  ] willingly commented on recent press reports that [ORG Saif  ] was working to reform the [ORG Libyan Islamic Fighting Group  ] ( [ORG LIFG  ] ) and had succeeded in urging them to adopt a more moderate doctrine . 
[PER Sawani  ] said that [ORG QDF  ] had provided reading and reference material to [ORG LIFG  ] members being held in [MISC Libyan  ] detention facilities , in order to teach them more moderate views of [MISC Islam  ] . 
He said that [ORG Saif  ] 's work with the [ORG LIFG  ] , coupled with the Leader 's political backing , had succeeded in reforming the [ORG LIFG  ] platform . 
The group produced a 400-page doctrine stating its revised goals and outlining a more moderate [MISC Islamic  ] philosophy . 
[PER Sawani  ] noted that [ORG QDF  ] had facilitated meetings between [ORG LIFG  ] members and well-respected [MISC Islamic  ] scholars such as [PER Yusuf al-Qardawi  ] and Sheikh [PER Ali Asalabi  ] . 
[PER Sawani  ] noted that the [ORG LIFG  ] in [LOC Libya  ] claimed never to have had ties to [ORG Al Qaeda  ] networks . 
He affirmed that he had read press reports from [LOC UK  ] and [MISC Switzerland-based  ] [ORG LIFG  ] networks announcing a severance of ties to [ORG Al Qaeda  ] , although he claimed not to have further insight into those decisions . 
6 . 
( C ) [MISC Comment:  ] Although [ORG Saif  ] al-Islam has claimed time and again that he is a non-political figure and will remain outside of politics , his recent moves to reform the [ORG LIFG  ] , secure [PER Megrahi  ] 's release , and work to compensate victims of the [LOC Abu Salim  ] prison riots all appear to be political overtures . 
His status as a non-governmental entity may benefit his chances for succession , as he would take after his father 's role as extra-governmental " Leader " of the people 's [LOC Jamahiriya  ] , and may therefore be in his best interest . 
His humanitarian agenda also lends him a good platform for dealing with the [LOC West  ] and building relations with reform-minded individuals within [LOC Libya  ] . 
While [ORG Saif  ] has been steadily withdrawing from the public scene since last year 's youth rally ( ref C ) , a confluence of high-profile events - including the [PER Megrahi  ] release , the August 20 youth rally and launch of his new satellite television station , and the September 1 anniversary of the revolution - could throw him back into the spotlight . 
End Comment .
