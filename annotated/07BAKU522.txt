( C ) SUMMARY . 
In an April 18 conversation with the Ambassador , [ORG Energy and Industry  ] Minister [PER Natiq Aliyev  ] said that [ORG GOAJ  ] would continue its close cooperation with [ORG BP  ] , and that in principle the [ORG GOAJ  ] supported [ORG BP  ] plans for [ORG ACG PSA  ] extension and [ORG ACG  ] deep gas . 
The [ORG GOAJ  ] also wants [ORG BP  ] as [PER Shah Deniz  ] operator to accelerate [MISC Phase Two  ] production and to work with [ORG SOCAR  ] to develop other fields . 
He said that the [ORG GOAJ  ] cannot commit gas that “belongs to [ORG BP  ] , ” and any specific public commitments or comments about future levels of [MISC Azerbaijani  ] gas production should be made and supported by both [ORG BP  ] and the [ORG GOAJ  ] . 
The [ORG GOAJ  ] needs some type of “lever” over [ORG BP  ] to ensure that it lives up to its production commitments . 
He suspected [ORG BP  ] was purposefully dragging its feet on [MISC Shah Deniz Phase Two  ] development due to ambiguity about transit costs and the ultimate market for this gas . 
END SUMMARY <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On April 18 the Ambassador met with [ORG Energy and Industry  ] Minister [PER Natiq  ] [PER Aliyev  ] to discuss future [MISC Azerbaijani  ] gas production . 
EnergyOff was notetaker. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The Ambassador told [PER Aliyev  ] that she had talked with President [PER Aliyev  ] recently on energy matters ( reftel ) . 
She said that in her April 16 discussion with President [PER Aliyev  ] , he said the [ORG GOAJ  ] “cannot commit gas that it does not own , ” and that [ORG GOAJ  ] gas production o/a 2012 depends largely on [ORG BP  ] as the [PER Shah Deniz  ] consortium operator . 
She told Energy Minister [PER Aliyev  ] that [PER DAS Bryza  ] was meeting with [MISC Hungarian  ] Prime Minister [PER Gyurcsany  ] on April 20 to discuss , inter alia , the [PER Nabucco  ] pipeline , amidst [MISC Hungarian  ] concerns that [LOC Azerbaijan  ] would not be able to supply sufficient gas to get it started . 
Prior to this meeting in [LOC Budapest  ] , the Ambassador wanted to ensure that the [ORG USG  ] knew and accurately reflected the message the [ORG GOAJ  ] wanted to put out concerning its willingness and ability to supply gas for [PER Nabucco  ] , and President [PER Aliyev  ] had suggested she confer with the [ORG Energy and Industry  ] Minister. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG Energy and Industry  ] Minister [PER Aliyev  ] said that he had just met with visiting [ORG BP  ] Production and Exploration [PER Head Andy Inglis  ] , whom he told that the [ORG GOAJ  ] was ready to accelerate gas production efforts within the [ORG EU Commission  ] framework . 
[PER Aliyev  ] said the [ORG GOAJ  ] wanted to show its desire to participate in commercially viable gas projects , such as TGI , [PER Nabucco  ] , and transiting gas from [LOC Kazakhstan  ] and/or [LOC Turkmenistan  ] . 
However , for much if not most of the [MISC GOAJ’s  ] gas production , “we depend on [MISC BP.” When  ] the Ambassador pointed out that there was the possibility that the [ORG GOAJ  ] would “lose out” on securing gas contracts with [MISC European  ] consumers unless they could reassure them that [LOC Azerbaijan  ] was willing and able to supply gas , the Energy Minister stressed that the [ORG GOAJ  ] is ready and willing to coordinate and cooperate with [MISC European  ] customers , but the [ORG GOAJ  ] has no ability to fulfill BP’s obligations. “We can’t answer [LOC Europe  ] ( re availability of gas ) without [ORG BP  ] , ” [PER Aliyev  ] stressed . 
For this reason , the [ORG GOAJ  ] was unwilling to publicly commit to supply “20 bcm o/a 2012” without support from [ORG BP.  ] “It would be naive for [LOC Azerbaijan  ] to commit 5 to 10 bcm to [PER Nabucco  ] without “some type of lever” over [ORG BP  ] , [PER Aliyev  ] said. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Aliyev  ] also said that the [ORG GOAJ  ] had no power to compel [ORG BP  ] to produce gas on schedule , and that [ORG BP  ] has no strong obligation to implement the [MISC GOAJ’s  ] annual production program , which was designed based on [ORG BP  ] gas production estimates . 
He complained that “BP has no responsibility for fulfilling production quotas ; under the [ORG PSA  ] there is no recourse for non-performance.” There had been a delay of “three to four years” with [ORG BTC  ] , and with [PER Shah Deniz  ] , [LOC Azerbaijan  ] was committed to deliver gas to [LOC Turkey  ] in 2006 , but hadn’t been able to because of production delays. “We must have strong cooperation with [ORG BP  ] , ” but [PER Aliyev  ] said he didn’t know “how to ensure that [ORG BP  ] fulfills its obligations - we can’t punish them or make claims against them.” [ORG BP  ] provides gas production estimates to the [ORG GOAJ  ] , but “these aren’t obligations , and [ORG BP  ] can change them anytime.” <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Aliyev  ] said that this year [ORG BP  ] had projected that [PER Shah Deniz  ] would produce 5.6 bcm , but now they say “no more than” three bcm , “which means probably around two bcm.” “If we had gotten the promised 5.6 bcm , the [ORG GOAJ  ] could have provided gas to [LOC Georgia  ] this last winter without any problem... and now [LOC BAKU  ] 00000522 002 OF 003 they are saying that there will be a second [PER Shah Deniz  ] well producing in May , but I don’t believe them.” [PER Aliyev  ] did grudgingly admit that offshore deep-sea gas production was “difficult , ” and that [ORG BP  ] was being “careful - we can’t push them too much.” <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The Ambassador agreed with [PER Aliyev  ] that it was a difficult situation , given the [MISC GOAJ’s  ] strong desire to accelerate production and export gas to [LOC Europe  ] . 
In response to the Ambassador saying that it was important for the [ORG GOAJ  ] to state publicly its policy goal regarding Azerbaijan’s willingness and ability to export this gas to [LOC Europe  ] , [PER Aliyev  ] said that he thought that [ORG SOCAR  ] and [ORG BP  ] should make a joint declaration , “because without [ORG BP  ] , Azerbaijan’s commitment means nothing.” [ORG SOCAR  ] and [ORG BP  ] should be working together on [PER Shah Deniz  ] and [ORG ACG Deep Gas  ] , with [ORG BP  ] making production estimates and the [ORG GOAJ  ] approving them . 
[ORG BP  ] AND [ORG GOAJ  ] COOPERATION ----------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Energy Minister [PER Aliyev  ] said that [ORG BP  ] has large proposals for oil and gas projects in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] . 
It has upgraded its estimates of oil reserves at the [ORG ACG  ] field from an original estimate of 2.4 billion barrels to 9 billion barrels . 
As such , [ORG BP  ] claims that at the end of the current [ORG PSA  ] ( 2024 ) , only 60-70 percent of the field’s recoverable production could have been extracted , with two billion barrels left in the ground . 
[PER Aliyev  ] said the [ORG GOAJ  ] agrees in principle to extending the [ORG PSA  ] , but “now is not 1994 , ” and the terms will change . 
The [ORG GOAJ  ] will calculate to ensure that it preserves its equities. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Minister [PER Aliyev  ] said that in general , the [ORG GOAJ  ] was willing to cooperate with [ORG BP  ] on [ORG ACG  ] [ORG PSA  ] extension , on [ORG ACG Deep Gas  ] , and on accelerating production for [MISC Shah Deniz Phase Two  ] ( [ORG SD2  ] ) . 
He also said that the [ORG GOAJ  ] was ready to continue cooperating with [ORG BP  ] on other [ORG SOCAR  ] exploration blocks . 
( COMMENT: This statement has not been reflected by public pronouncements from [ORG SOCAR  ] , which instead has expressed a desire to increase its control in exploring remaining offshore fields . 
) [ORG BP  ] RELUCTANT ON [ORG SD2  ] ? -------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Aliyev  ] said that given the high price of gas if nothing else , the [ORG GOAJ  ] should accelerate gas production as much as it could . 
With [ORG SD2  ] production beginning o/a 2012 , overall [PER Shah Deniz  ] production would be 16 to 20 bcm . 
He said that he thought it unlikely that [ORG SD2  ] production could be accelerated earlier than 2011-2012 , although to an extent this depended on capital expenditure levels . 
He said [ORG SD2  ] development is going to take a lot of capital expenditure , and he thought that [ORG BP  ] doesn’t think that there is an existing transportation option for [ORG SD2  ] gas . 
The existing system delivers only to [LOC Erzerum  ] , and the [MISC Turkish  ] market is very limited . 
Before committing to [ORG SD2  ] development , [ORG BP  ] needs to see the details of transit/transport and a market for [ORG SD2  ] gas beyond [LOC Turkey  ] , i.e . 
[LOC Greece  ] , [LOC Italy  ] , the [LOC Balkans  ] . 
The existing [MISC Turkey-Greece  ] pipeline capacity is only three to five bcm , which in BP’s eyes is insufficient . 
[ORG BP  ] doesn’t see a delivery system for [ORG SD2  ] gas and doesn’t see terms and conditions of transit . 
[PER Nabucco  ] is a project on paper only at this point , and overall there are “too many unknowns” relating to export of [ORG SD2  ] gas to make a commercial decision . 
As such , [PER Aliyev  ] said he thought [ORG BP  ] is seeking to delay decisions on [ORG SD2  ] development until more factors , such as commercial transit fees , were known . 
[ORG SD2  ] MARKETING ------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) In response to the [MISC Ambassador’s  ] question about [ORG SD2  ] marketing , [PER Aliyev  ] said that he thinks this issue would be solved between [ORG Statoil  ] and [ORG SOCAR  ] , because “it is not easy to be a seller , and [ORG Statoil  ] has experience - if [ORG SOCAR  ] wants to sell , first they have to learn how.” He thought that [ORG SOCAR  ] was currently not ready to market [ORG SD2  ] gas , but that “there was time” for them to learn . 
[PER Aliyev  ] went on to say that it was “too early” to worry about [ORG SD2  ] marketing . 
He mused that perhaps there could be a “rotation system” for [ORG SD2  ] gas sales , with the marketer changing among [ORG SD Consortium  ] partners every two years . 
[LOC BAKU  ] 00000522 003 OF 003 <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) When the Ambassador tried clarifying with the Energy Minister what the [ORG USG  ] and [ORG GOAJ  ] can say publicly about future [MISC Azerbaijani  ] gas exports , [PER Aliyev  ] said that one could say ( as did the President recently ) that exploration has shown that [ORG SD  ] has 1.2 trillion cubic meters of recoverable reserves , and that [LOC Azerbaijan  ] is committed to providing as much gas as possible as soon as possible to [LOC Europe  ] ( [MISC Baku-based  ] energy insiders were puzzled by President Aliyev’s recent statement on [ORG SD  ] capacity , as it exceeded current [ORG SD  ] recoverable reserve estimates ) . 
The [ORG GOAJ  ] does not want to prematurely commit itself , but [ORG SD2  ] production will allow exports through [LOC Turkey  ] . 
What is possible now are statements of political intent , which the [ORG GOAJ  ] has made and is making , [PER Aliyev  ] said ; [ORG BP  ] should also publicly “sign on” to these expressions of intent. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) In response to the [MISC Ambassador’s  ] comment that the [ORG GOAJ  ] needs to send a clear and strong signal to [LOC Europe  ] that Azerbaijan’s will and intention are strong , [PER Aliyev  ] said that [PER Shah Deniz  ] production combined with other [ORG GOAJ  ] gas production , to include new discoveries , is enough to supply gas to [LOC Europe  ] , without gas from [LOC Kazakhstan  ] or [LOC Turkmenistan  ] . 
But [ORG BP  ] as operator must commit to this goal too . 
For its part , the [ORG GOAJ  ] is willing to move forward with [ORG BP  ] on [ORG ACG Deep Gas  ] , on accelerating [ORG SD2  ] production , and on exploring other [ORG GOAJ  ] options . 
But [ORG BP  ] programs and commitments must be approved and controlled “on a high level” by [ORG BP  ] and the [ORG GOAJ  ] together . 
[PER Aliyev  ] said that it was in the strategic interest of the [ORG GOAJ  ] to deliver gas to [LOC Europe  ] , and that in this regard there had to be strong cooperation among [ORG SOCAR  ] , [ORG BP  ] and the [ORG GOAJ  ] . 
[ORG BP  ] Production and Exploration [PER Head Andy Inglis  ] would be returning to [LOC Azerbaijan  ] in June to continue discussions with [ORG SOCAR  ] on a range of issues , to include [ORG PSA  ] extension , accelerated [ORG SD  ] production , and [ORG ACG Deep Gas  ] . 
The [ORG Energy Ministry  ] was not involved with [MISC BP-SOCAR  ] negotiations . 
NEED FOR TRANSIT REGIME ---------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Aliyev  ] said that before making any decisions about gas sales , all parties involved must know the relevant information about delivery through [LOC Turkey  ] , to include [MISC Turkish  ] transit information , so that all involved costs are known . 
The Ambassador pointed out that time was a factor , as [MISC European  ] customers had to make decisions soon for long-term gas contracts . 
[PER Aliyev  ] said that the President has not yet authorized transit talks with [LOC Turkey  ] ( COMMENT: We are following up with the [ORG GOAJ  ] on their desired timeline for transit talks with [LOC Turkey  ] ) . 
He asked that the [ORG USG  ] to “push the [LOC Turks”  ] towards beginning transit talks with [LOC Azerbaijan  ] . 
As a first step , the Minister said that [ORG BP  ] has to forward a letter to the President about terms and conditions that need to be negotiated , saying that an [ORG Intergovernmental Agreement  ] with [LOC Turkey  ] is needed. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) COMMENT: The Energy Minister strongly underscored the [ORG GOAJ  ] position that [LOC Azerbaijan  ] is ready to provide as much gas possible as soon as possible to [LOC Europe  ] , and repeated the [ORG GOAJ  ] talking point heard from [ORG SOCAR  ] and President [PER Aliyev  ] that statements about specific volumes of future gas production must be made in conjunction with [ORG BP  ] . 
Embassy will follow up with [ORG BP  ] to ascertain concerning the status and nature of its discussions with [ORG SOCAR  ] and the [ORG GOAJ  ] . 
END COMMENT .
