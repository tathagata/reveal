( b ) & ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Introduction and [ORG Summary:  ] The [PER Nicolas Sarkozy  ] who arrives in [LOC Washington  ] November 6 is in robust political health . 
He completely dominates the politics of [LOC France  ] . 
All the levers of institutional power in a highly centralized state are at his disposal . 
He remains committed to a revitalization of [LOC France  ] , through a reform of policies and laws that have acted as a break on [MISC French  ] economic growth . 
The challenge now is to put his ideas and programs into effect . 
Off to a quick start this summer , with the implementation of a first series of reform measures , [PER Sarkozy  ] is now beginning to feel the full force of [MISC French  ] resistance to change . 
His public support as reflected in the polls is high , but has slipped of late . 
The political impact of the first direct challenge , last week’s national transportation strike , is not yet clear , but strikes in other sectors are threatening , raising the possibility of the kind of crisis atmosphere [PER Sarkozy  ] had hoped to avoid , given his electoral mandate and professed openness to dialogue . 
The image of a well-oiled , disciplined machine has suffered , as [PER Sarkozy  ] has repeatedly rebuked members of his team , including his own Prime Minister , raising questions about a thin-skinned and authoritarian personal style . 
The concentration of power and decision-making in the [LOC Presidency  ] has made for uneven decision-making and follow-through . 
The prospect of slower domestic and international economic growth and a tight GOF budget have narrowed his room for maneuver . 
His appointment to the cabinet of women and minority representatives and the more populist style of his Presidency have been well-received , but his omnipresence and hyper-activity risk overexposure and [ORG Sarkozy-fatigue  ] . 
Finally , freshly divorced from [PER Cecilia  ] , he is deprived of someone who ( by his own account ) was crucial to his personal equilibrium and served as a valued political sounding board. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While not central to his Presidential campaign , [PER Sarkozy  ] has quickly asserted [MISC French  ] leadership in [LOC Europe  ] and staked out new positions and a role for [LOC France  ] on the most pressing international issues . 
He believes that a relationship of trust and close cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] enhances [MISC France’s  ] ability to make an impact -- toward the achievement of what are in most cases common objectives . 
After five months in office he ( and his foreign minister , [PER Bernard Kouchner  ] ) have begun to make their mark . 
They have overseen a dramatic shift in [MISC French  ] policy on [LOC Iraq  ] , reversed declining [MISC French  ] support in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , have set in motion a possible “return” to [ORG NATO  ] , toughened [MISC France’s  ] approach to [LOC Iran  ] and also [LOC Russia  ] , and promised a new one toward [LOC Africa  ] . 
The top foreign policy issue for [PER Sarkozy  ] is the environment , which he has embraced as a headline issue , linking foreign and domestic policy . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] and [PER Kouchner  ] also assign priority to [LOC Kosovo  ] , [LOC Lebanon  ] , and [ORG Darfur  ] . 
Sarkozy’s decision to assist the [MISC Dutch  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] is the latest illustration of a willingness to push a cautious bureaucracy and military and to break the mold of [LOC Chirac-era  ] policy . 
Despite , and perhaps because of , convergence with the [LOC U.S.  ] on key issues , and the dramatic improvement in the tone of the relationship , [PER Sarkozy  ] has identified specific areas of disagreement with the [LOC U.S.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) We continue to believe that [PER Sarkozy  ] represents an important opportunity . 
Energetic , in full command at home , he is determined to make a mark on the international scene . 
As distinct from [ORG Chirac  ] , who advocated multi-polar containment of [LOC U.S.  ] hegemony , [PER Sarkozy  ] is well-disposed personally to the [LOC U.S.  ] He wants close policy cooperation with us , but in a relationship that gives [LOC France  ] its full due as an independent player. “Alliance , not alignment” is the way he usually puts it , although he is not beyond striking a more defiant pose , as recently in [LOC Moscow  ] , when he stated publicly that he would not be a “vassal” of the [LOC U.S.  ] He will also continue to highlight differences on selected issues -- [LOC PARIS  ] 00004357 002 OF 011 such as the environment , GMOs and Turkey’s relationship with [LOC Europe  ] -- as demonstrations of [MISC France’s  ] independent policy course . 
His emphasis of [MISC French  ] independence makes less controversial at home both the warming up of the bilateral relationship and the bold policy decisions in such areas as [LOC Iraq  ] , [ORG NATO  ] , and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
A distinct [MISC French  ] approach , supportive on many issues , but not in lock-step , is in our interest . 
A partner with the international bone fides that [LOC France  ] retains , as a leading [MISC European  ] power close to but proudly independent of the [LOC U.S.  ] , is one that can enlarge our ability to effect positive outcomes internationally. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) In addition to setting the scene for Sarkozy’s first official visit to [LOC Washington  ] , this message iterates the state of play in a long list of issues where opportunities and challenges abound in [MISC U.S.-France  ] relations . 
End Summary PART ONE: [PER SARKOZY  ] FIVE MONTHS INTO HIS PRESIDENCY <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Nicolas Sarkozy’s  ] visit to [LOC Washington  ] follows an exceptionally long “state of grace” ( as the [MISC French  ] call a political honeymoon ) , one that only began to peter out in October , the fifth month of Sarkozy’s Presidency . 
Through the summer and well into the new [MISC French  ] political year that begins in September , [PER Sarkozy  ] seemed incapable of a political misstep . 
His poll ratings set records both vertically ( level ) and horizontally ( durability ) . 
For a politician long attacked as an extremist and a divider , this was no small feat. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Sarkozy’s success is attributable to several factors . 
While Candidate [PER Sarkozy  ] ran a hard right election campaign geared to winning over the 15-20 percent of the votes that [PER Jean-Marie LePen’s National Front  ] had captured in recent years , President [PER Sarkozy  ] quickly made clear he wanted to be a President of all the [MISC French  ] , not just the political right . 
He also made clear that his ambition would not be satisfied with his election to the Presidency . 
He was determined to use the office to get [LOC France  ] moving again -- unleashing its economic potential , allowing it to surmount long-term budgetary , financial and social challenges . 
He would do this by making good on his program of concrete reform measures , which had received a mandate from the [MISC French  ] electorate. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Immediately after his election in May , [PER Sarkozy  ] embarked on a policy of inclusiveness ( “ouverture” ) , bringing in leading figures of the opposition , including the [ORG Socialist Party  ] ( such as Foreign Minister [PER Kouchner  ] ) , the non-Gaullist center-right , and civil society . 
In addition , he shattered the white-male cast of previous [MISC French  ] governments with his appointments of women and minorities , including to key ministries . 
On the strength of his electoral mandate , and with this inclusiveness as cover , [PER Sarkozy  ] moved swiftly , and with virtually no Socialist opposition , to implement his reform program , moving five major pieces of legislation through Parliament by early October . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] seemed well on his way to proving that [LOC France  ] could embrace change , and that he could imprint on it the “culture of results” that would be the basis for less painful , self-renewing change in the future. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Over the past few weeks , shadows have entered this unnaturally bright picture . 
Current polling suggests that while support for [PER Sarkozy  ] remains at historically high levels ( in the low 60’s , depending on the poll ) , there has been a slow erosion in his standing , which has perhaps accelerated in the past few weeks . 
In the first serious push-back against a key reform , [MISC French  ] public transport unions engaged in a country-wide strike on October 18 over the generous pensions available to public transport workers . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] [LOC PARIS  ] 00004357 003 OF 011 insists that this time unions will not be able to scuttle this or any other part of the government’s reform program -- while continuing to stress the need for dialogue , not government fiat , as the mode of action . 
However , international economic uncertainty affords [PER Sarkozy  ] far less room for maneuver as he seeks to reduce both government expenditures and taxes to unleash economic activity , while not fatally exacerbating [MISC France’s  ] already alarming debt situation. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Sarkozy’s unexpected willingness to compromise on several of his reform measures may signal recognition of the hard economic realities . 
However , he risks diminishing this image of determination and command -- key components of his political success thus far . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] appeared critical of both his Finance Minister and his Prime Minister in turn when the former called for “greater rigor” in state spending and the latter described the state as “bankrupt” in parliamentary hearings . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] , fearing that alarmist pronouncements could undermine the public’s confidence , risks creating an impression of friction and hesitation at the top . 
Sarkozy’s close personal association with policy reform has reduced his ability to cast aside the Prime Minister or other officials should his policies lose public support. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The transport unions are but one of the constituencies [PER Sarkozy  ] will offend in shaking the [MISC French  ] economy loose from policies that have held back growth and bloated public spending . 
As he pushes for reforms that make it easier to fire workers , shrink the size of the state ( whose spending represents 52 percent of GDP ) by cutting the civil service , and open up retail markets to more competition , he can expect further pushback from well-entrenched constituencies . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] has set in motion a series of negotiations on these issues that ultimately could lead to important systemic change . 
But the real impact will only become clear once the negotiations conclude -- probably in early 2008 -- and the government is forced to make politically difficult decisions. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC France’s  ] broader economic environment will not make the reform process any easier . 
Having promised the electorate measures that would bring an extra percentage point of growth to the economy , the [PER Sarkozy  ] government finds itself at a delicate point in the business cycle . 
The government has already scaled back earlier 2007 growth estimates , and most private sector economists believe the government’s 2008 estimates are inflated . 
Although the fiscal stimulus from tax cuts passed this summer may give the president a short-term boost , he is unlikely to enjoy the political benefit of a strong growth environment in which to pursue his supply-side reforms . 
He has also promised the [MISC French  ] people increased purchasing power , which will be hard to achieve . 
Some of this he blames on the strength of the dollar. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Sarkozy  ] is keen on unleashing market forces to reinvigorate the [MISC French  ] economy , but he is less than laissez-faire when it comes to restructuring [MISC French  ] industry . 
The [MISC French  ] state owns a far smaller share of the economy than was once the case , but it still has effective control of energy and other key sectors . 
Sarkozy’s industrial policy seems to be based on facilitating the emergence of key [MISC French  ] firms as leaders in their industries in [LOC Europe  ] and globally . 
While [MISC European  ] experience with national champions industrial policies is shaky , the [MISC French  ] have done comparatively well of late . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] does not hesitate to reduce state ownership in these deals . 
The merger of [ORG Gaz de France  ] with [ORG Suez  ] creates a [MISC European  ] giant in gas and energy but also reduces the [MISC French  ] stake in its gas company from 80 percent to 30 percent. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) At the macroeconomic level , [PER Sarkozy  ] has been highly critical of the [MISC European  ] [LOC Central Bank’s  ] tight money , strong [MISC Euro  ] policy and he is all but ignoring previously [LOC PARIS  ] 00004357 004 OF 011 agreed [MISC Eurozone  ] commitments to brining budgets back into balance . 
In both cases , [MISC Eurozone  ] partners have little recourse and [LOC France  ] can ride for free on the budget discipline of its partners , at least for a while . 
In the meantime , the President’s approach plays well at home , and often appears designed for domestic consumption. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC U.S.-French  ] economic relationship remains robust , with over $1 billion in commercial transactions per day taking place between the two countries’ firms . 
During President Sarkozy’s visit , [MISC CEOs  ] from some of the most important of these will meet , for the first time in several years as the [ORG French-American Business Council  ] ( [ORG FABC  ] ) to exchange views on policy priorities . 
[LOC U.S.  ] firms have been almost unanimously positive about the [PER Sarkozy  ] government . 
Nonetheless there are a number of regulatory unknowns that could potentially impact [LOC U.S.  ] commercial interests . 
Among these are the [MISC GOF’s  ] evolving views on genetically-modified organisms , [ORG IPR  ] in the digital environment and pricing policy as it relates to pharmaceutical spending. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) On permanent overdrive and intense in the best of times , Sarkozy’s recent divorce raises questions about his ability to maintain his equilibrium and focus . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] has himself spoken of his dependence on [PER Cecilia  ] -- “my source of strength and my [PER Achilles Heel  ] , ” as he put it . 
During their separation in 2005 , a highly irritable , darker [PER Sarkozy  ] came into view -- the same one that reappeared at the [LOC Lisbon Summit  ] the day after the announcement of the divorce . 
How much [PER Cecilia  ] really anchored him , personally and politically , should soon become evident , but we are betting on Sarkozy’s ability to bounce back. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) Notwithstanding the debate swirling around him and his slight decline in the polls , Sarkozy’s political health remains strong . 
He controls all the main levers of power: the Presidency , the Parliament , the dominant political party , and the omnipresent agents of the [MISC French  ] state . 
The opposition Socialists are in disarray , incapable for the moment of taking unified policy positions . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] is in a position to reassert [MISC French  ] leadership in [LOC Europe  ] and in international affairs generally . 
He ( and Foreign Minister [PER Bernard Kouchner  ] ) have also begun to make their mark , unevenly , on [MISC French  ] policy . 
The foreign policy equivalent of his domestic “rupture” are his [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and possibly [ORG NATO  ] . 
On [LOC Iraq  ] , [PER Sarkozy  ] and [PER Kouchner  ] have made a dramatic difference , offering political support and associating [LOC France  ] with reconstruction efforts -- and prompting surprisingly little opposition or criticism . 
On [ORG NATO  ] , [PER Sarkozy  ] has challenged his bureaucracy -- and the [LOC U.S.  ] -- to find a way to fashion a win-win approach for [ORG NATO  ] and [ORG ESDP  ] that would entail a full [MISC French  ] “return” to [ORG NATO  ] , although the specifics of Sarkozy’s conditions have not yet been worked through . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] will be calculating the political cost of any shift on [ORG NATO  ] , knowing that he would be breaking a foreign policy consensus that has long enjoyed the support of the Gaullist right , much of the center , and all of the left . 
Other issues already showing Sarkozy’s imprint include: [LOC Russia  ] , where he is less willing to accommodate and is increasingly concerned about [MISC Russian  ] intentions and objectives ; the [LOC Middle East  ] , where he has introduced a new emphasis on [MISC Israel’s  ] security into the inhospitable ground of [MISC France’s  ] “politique Arabe” ; and , [LOC Africa  ] , where [PER Sarkozy  ] appears intent on finally making a break from [MISC France’s  ] post-colonial reflexes and relationships . 
Other high priority issues which [PER Sarkozy  ] will also want to discuss include his top issue , climate change , along with [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Kosovo  ] , [LOC Burma  ] , [LOC Darfur  ] , counterterrorism and climate change . 
Sarkozy’s approach to these and other international issues of concern to both [LOC France  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] are discussed in the second section of this cable . 
PART TWO: [LOC PARIS  ] 00004357 005 OF 011 KEY POLICY ISSUES: WHERE THEY ARE AND WHERE WE WANT THEM TO BE <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) The [LOC White House  ] has already publicly enumerated key topics on the visit agenda: [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Middle East  ] Peace , [LOC Lebanon  ] , [LOC Darfur  ] , [LOC Burma  ] , [LOC Kosovo  ] , counterterrorism , and the promotion of democracy . 
Herein follows a snapshot of where the [MISC French  ] are on each of them and on some additional areas , and where we would like to move them . 
Our list is topped by thee priority policy issues -- [LOC Iraq  ] , [ORG NATO  ] , and [LOC Russia  ] -- sufficiently sensitive not to have been publicly highlighted in the [LOC White House  ] announcement , along with [LOC Afghanistan  ] , followed by climate change , which will likely be highest on Sarkozy’s list. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [MISC Iraq:  ] The sudden and dramatic [MISC French  ] decision , days following the President’s meeting in [LOC Kennebunkport  ] , to break with previous policy and reengage with [LOC Iraq  ] has uncertain paternity -- with both [PER Sarkozy  ] and [PER Kouchner  ] claiming credit . 
Following Kouchner’s three-day visit to [LOC Iraq  ] in August , the [ORG GOF  ] has already hosted both President [PER Talibani  ] and FM [MISC Zebari  ] . 
Last week , [PER Sarkozy  ] told [PER Talibani  ] that [LOC France  ] wanted to help [LOC Iraq  ] across the board -- politically , diplomatically , educationally , and culturally . 
[MISC French  ] assistance will not include any commitment of [MISC French  ] troops in [LOC Iraq  ] , but it could include training for [MISC Iraqi  ] security/police units as well as counterterrorism forces . 
The [MISC French  ] have promised other , initially symbolic measures such as opening a diplomatic office in the northern city of [LOC Irbil  ] and aid for a hospital in the same area . 
[PER Kouchner  ] has already pressed the [ORG EU  ] to become more active in multinational efforts at reconstruction , which [LOC France  ] would like the [ORG UN  ] to head up . 
Any [LOC U.S.  ] diplomatic conference or initiative could garner [MISC French  ] support: [PER Kouchner  ] plans to attend the upcoming ministerial meeting in [LOC Istanbul  ] of [LOC Iraq’s  ] “neighbors.” In fact , the [MISC French  ] are just starting to figure out how they can best help [LOC Iraq  ] , especially to relieve what they see as a harsh humanitarian situation . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] would likely be open to detailed discussion on this topic: Given his and Kouchner’s identification with the new policy , and abiding lack of enthusiasm in at least parts of the bureaucracy , he is in fact the best place to start . 
Regarding the [LOC U.S.  ] role , [PER Sarkozy  ] and [PER Kouchner  ] do not share their predecessors’ fixation on our continued troop presence . 
They understand and acknowledge the reality that a hasty pullout of [LOC U.S.  ] troops would lead to a worsening , not a lessening , of the violence with potentially grave implications for the larger region . 
We should push [PER Sarkozy  ] to implement humanitarian and reconstruction programs in [LOC Iraq  ] , starting with an already promised medical clinic in the [MISC Kurdish  ] north , as soon as possible. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) Iran: Sarkozy’s blunt language on the “unacceptability” of a militarily nuclear [LOC Iran  ] , and the need to maintain maximum pressure on the [MISC Iranian  ] regime over its nuclear program has only been exceeded by that of his foreign minister . 
The degree to which [LOC France  ] has taken a public lead with the [ORG EU  ] to press for additional [MISC European  ] sanctions should the [ORG UNSC  ] be unable to act has been as impressive as has Sarkozy’s willingness to confront [MISC Russian  ] President [PER Putin  ] over this issue . 
[MISC French  ] officials make the point that [LOC Paris  ] has a “normal” diplomatic relationship with [LOC Tehran  ] despite sharp disagreements on the nuclear question . 
In this context , the [MISC French  ] have particularly valued their quiet dialogue over [LOC Lebanon  ] , which has convinced them that , by contrast with [LOC Syria  ] , [LOC Iran  ] has no interest in renewed internal violence that might accompany failure to elect a new president . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] has proven impervious to [MISC Iranian  ] blandishments aimed at softening [MISC France’s  ] position or even to break it away from the [ORG P-5  ] 1 group , much to [MISC Iran’s  ] chagrin . 
The meetings with [PER Sarkozy  ] offer an opportunity to bolster [MISC France’s  ] tough line , and it can be expected that [PER Sarkozy  ] will want to get a sense from the President of his analysis of our [LOC PARIS  ] 00004357 006 OF 011 ability to influence [MISC Iranian  ] choices , and how best to maintain international pressure toward that end . 
Having just met with [MISC Israeli  ] PM Olmert to discuss the same issue , [PER Sarkozy  ] will be keen to understand the limits of our patience while we pursue the diplomatic track , which , like us , [LOC France  ] prefers to exhaust before considering military options. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) NATO: In one of his first acts as President , [PER Sarkozy  ] launched a defense “white paper” commission to review [MISC France’s  ] defense and security priorities ; one component of the report ( expected in March 2008 ) is a review of [MISC France’s  ] relationship with [ORG NATO  ] . 
The defense white paper could set the stage for a possible full re-integration into the [ORG NATO  ] military command . 
President [PER Sarkozy  ] and Defense Minister [PER Morin  ] launched a public debate over a deeper [MISC French  ] role in the Alliance in September in two major foreign policy speeches . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] clarified that [MISC French  ] rapprochement to [ORG NATO  ] would be tied to two conditions: 1 ) strengthening [MISC European  ] defense structures by developing [MISC Europe’s  ] own capabilities to plan and carry out defense and security operations , and 2 ) seeking [MISC French  ] representation in the highest “decision making posts of [LOC NATO.”  ] The [ORG MFA  ] and defense establishment uniformly caution us against raised expectations , with some in the [ORG Sarkozy Administration  ] ( reportedly including Prime Minister [PER Fillon  ] ) concerned that abrupt moves toward [ORG NATO  ] could be controversial domestically . 
All , beginning with [PER Sarkozy  ] , argue that , at a minimum , [ORG ESDP  ] needs to be strengthened in parallel . 
The idea seems to be that a [MISC French  ] embrace of [ORG NATO  ] will ease [LOC U.S.  ] concerns about a more robustly structured [MISC European  ] defense , while progress on that front will help ease opposition at home to [MISC France’s  ] “return” to [ORG NATO  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] will likely use his speech before [ORG Congress  ] to further refine his public approach , casting [MISC France’s  ] willingness to move ahead in terms of working with the [LOC U.S.  ] as an independent ally and partner ( not automatically “aligned” to [LOC U.S.  ] positions ) . 
We believe this visit offers an unprecedented opportunity to identify with [PER Sarkozy  ] the common ground on which a mutually beneficial “bargain” on [ORG NATO  ] and [MISC European  ] defense might be elaborated . 
In addition to addressing the substance of Sarkozy’s two “conditions , ” we will want to learn how open he is to modifying [MISC France’s  ] narrowly military , [MISC Europe-focused  ] vision of [ORG NATO  ] , and whether he will be on a sufficiently fast track to implement or in some way foreshadow elements of a “bargain” at [LOC Bucharest  ] in [LOC April.  ] <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) Afghanistan: After a moment of hesitation during his Presidential campaign , [PER Sarkozy  ] now publicly highlights the importance of [MISC French  ] efforts in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[LOC France  ] has recently stepped up military commitments by deploying 3 additional [ORG Operational Mentoring  ] and [ORG Liaison Teams  ] ( OMLTs ) to complement the 2,000 military personnel ( [LOC ISAF  ] and OEF ) now deployed ( largely in and around [LOC Kabul  ] ) . 
Significantly , [PER Sarkozy  ] recently responded positively to the [MISC Dutch  ] Prime Minister’s pleas for a [MISC French  ] presence in [LOC Uruzgan  ] , needed to secure parliamentary approval for renewing the [MISC Netherlands’  ] participation in [LOC ISAF  ] . 
In agreeing to deploy a [MISC French  ] OMLT , [PER Sarkozy  ] again demonstrated his willingness to move ahead of more cautious advisors and a bureaucracy that prefers slow adaptation to bold moves . 
[LOC France  ] has taken other decisions to bolster its presence in [LOC Afghanistan  ] including moving six [MISC French  ] Mirage planes from [LOC Dushanbe  ] to [LOC Kandahar  ] . 
On September 10 , the [MISC French  ] and [MISC Germans  ] reaffirmed plans to support the [MISC German-led  ] [ORG EU  ] police training mission in [LOC Afghanistan  ] despite delays . 
On July 30 , [LOC SACEUR  ] officially requested six medium-lift helicopters to provide rotary-wing support in [LOC ISAF  ] ( to replace the [LOC U.S.  ] helicopters which are scheduled to depart early 2008 ) . 
[LOC France  ] is considering still this request . 
We should use the opportunity of the visit to persuade the [MISC French  ] to broaden and deepen their efforts in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , including by standing up a Provincial Reconstruction Team ( [ORG PRT  ] ) . 
We understand the Presidency favors this proposal , while civilian leadership at the [ORG MOD  ] opposes a [MISC French  ] PRT . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] may echo recent [ORG MFA  ] and [ORG MOD  ] [LOC PARIS  ] 00004357 007 OF 011 calls for a more “comprehensive [LOC Afghanistan  ] strategy , ” integrating military support and civilian reconstruction , and including a timeline for shifting the burden from the international coalition to the Government of [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Environment/Climate Change: Climate Change:  ] On his election day , [PER Sarkozy  ] called for a greater [LOC U.S  ] leadership role on climate issues . 
He will want to come out of his meeting with the President able to say that he again pushed the President to lead . 
The Embassy , backed closely by [LOC Washington  ] agencies , has impressed on not only [PER Sarkozy  ] and his staff , but also officials across [LOC France  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] has been leading and continues to lead in the fight against climate change . 
[ORG We’ve  ] impressed on them -- and [PER Sarkozy  ] should be told again -- that the [LOC U.S.  ] has spent $37 billion in the past six years -- more than any other country -- for climate science and energy research . 
[ORG We’ve  ] developed new international partnerships , part of a real strategy of international engagement to reduce carbon emissions . 
[ORG We’ve  ] shown the [MISC French  ] that even with considerably greater economic and population growth than in [LOC Europe  ] , we’re doing a better job at reducing both energy intensity and carbon emissions . 
After the President’s [MISC Major Economies Meeting  ] ( [ORG MEM  ] ) in late September in [LOC Washington  ] , [MISC French  ] officials offered to host the next meeting while expressing some disappointment with both the lack of agreement on a post-Kyoto emissions goal and [LOC U.S.  ] reluctance regarding market-based cap and trade measures . 
Areas of potential conflict include concerns that a failure for a broad adoption of similar carbon reduction schemes will put [MISC European  ] industry at a competitive disadvantage and the possible [MISC French  ] advocacy of a [MISC European  ] imposed carbon tax on imported goods . 
Despite extensive [MISC U.S.-French  ] collaboration in developing next generation climate-friendly technologies , the [MISC French  ] also criticize what they see as [LOC U.S.  ] over-reliance on yet-to-be-developed technologies ( carbon capture and storage , second generation bio-fuels , and advanced nuclear ) to address emissions . 
[LOC France  ] is skeptical that [LOC China  ] and [LOC India  ] and other major emerging economies will take steps to reduce emissions unless the [LOC U.S.  ] moves first . 
This is an opportunity to convince [PER Sarkozy  ] that we take this issue seriously and have a concrete plan to make real progress. <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( C ) Democracy Promotion/Burma: Under President [PER Sarkozy  ] , the [MISC French  ] position on [LOC Burma  ] has converged with that of the [LOC U.S.  ] [LOC France  ] vigorously condemned the regime’s crackdown on peaceful protesters ; pushed through as [ORG UNSC  ] president a presidential statement supporting the democracy movement ; supported toughening [ORG EU  ] sanctions ; and , bilaterally pressed [ORG ASEAN  ] members to take a tougher stand on [LOC Burma  ] . 
FM [PER Kouchner  ] will have visited [ORG ASEAN  ] countries and [LOC China  ] in the week before Sarkozy’s visit to [LOC Washington  ] to push the [MISC Burmese  ] leadership to reconcile with [PER Aung San Suu Kyi  ] and the political opposition . 
While [PER Sarkozy  ] seems forward-leaning ( he reportedly considered [MISC French  ] disinvestment before being dissuaded by advisors ) , thus far [LOC France  ] remains unprepared to implement unilateral sanctions . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] , however , has urged [MISC French  ] companies to freeze future investments . 
In our efforts to work with [LOC France  ] to promote democracy , we should appeal to [PER Sarkozy  ] to redouble [MISC French  ] efforts within the [ORG EU  ] to push for tough sanctions against the [LOC Junta  ] and for measures in support of the democracy movement. <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( C ) [MISC Russia:  ] During his first presidential visit to [LOC Russia  ] on October 9-10 , Sarkozy’s advisors were reportedly struck by [ORG Putin’s  ] defiant and distrustful attitude toward the [LOC U.S.  ] and his “revisionist” desire to dismantle or undermine the perceived anti-Russian institutional framework -- regional and international -- that has prevailed since the fall of the [LOC Soviet Union  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] made little or no progress with [PER Putin  ] on a broad range of topics including [LOC Iran  ] , missile defense , [LOC Georgia  ] and [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
Sarkozy’s positions tracked with [LOC U.S.  ] views except on [LOC Georgia  ] , where he favors future status that is short of [ORG NATO  ] membership . 
Sarkozy’s visit to [LOC Moscow  ] highlights a sea-change in [MISC Franco-Russian  ] relations [LOC PARIS  ] 00004357 008 OF 011 from the [ORG Chirac  ] era . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] has abandoned Chirac’s notion of [LOC Russia  ] as a counterweight to the [LOC U.S.  ] , and does not shy away from directly addressing difficult issues , including democracy , human rights and rule of law problems in [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC Chechnya  ] and energy policies . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] , for example , took the unprecedented ( for a [MISC French  ] President ) step of visiting human rights activists while in [LOC Moscow  ] . 
[LOC France  ] is concerned about both [ORG Putin’s  ] increasingly authoritarian style and [MISC Russia’s  ] increasing willingness to defy international opinion , as on [LOC CFE  ] and [LOC Georgia  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] is also less willing than [ORG Chirac  ] to allow energy security and trade priorities to dominate [PER France’s  ] appoach . 
That said , the [MISC French  ] never fail to remind us of [MISC Russia’s  ] relative proximity and [PER France’s  ] and Europe’s need to come to terms with a newly assertive [LOC Russia  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] will want to address how the [LOC U.S.  ] can work with [LOC France  ] , in cooperation with its major [MISC European  ] partners , to find a new modus vivendi with [LOC Russia  ] . 
We should use the meetings with [PER Sarkozy  ] to solidify a common approach of tough engagement with [LOC Russia  ] and highlight the need for the closest cooperation on four related subjects: [LOC Georgia  ] , [LOC Kosovo  ] , [ORG Missile Defense  ] and the [MISC Conventional Forces  ] in [LOC Europe  ] ( [LOC CFE  ] ) treaty. <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( C/NF ) [LOC Georgia:  ] In [LOC Moscow  ] October 9-10 , [PER Sarkozy  ] told [PER Putin  ] that [LOC France  ] opposes full [ORG NATO  ] membership for [LOC Georgia  ] ( although we have been assured he did not address [ORG MAP  ] for [LOC Georgia  ] with him ) . 
High-level [MISC French  ] interlocutors have emphasized in recent meetings that [LOC France  ] remains open to “something less than membership.” The [ORG GOF  ] has maintained that [ORG NATO  ] membership “should not create new lines of division” and that territorial conflicts should be resolved prior to membership -- and that [LOC Georgia  ] does not meet these criteria . 
[LOC France  ] is considering whether [ORG NATO  ] could offer [LOC Georgia  ] a different kind of status and a different approach to regional security , possibly combined with incentives including abolishing visas with the [ORG EU  ] . 
While we are aware of reports that [PER Sarkozy  ] told [MISC Georgian  ] President [PER Saakashvili  ] that he supports [ORG MAP  ] for [LOC Georgia  ] , the [ORG GOF  ] continues to oppose [ORG MAP  ] which would , in its view , create additional tensions with [LOC Russia  ] and exacerbate Georgia’s problems with its separatist regions . 
It also talks about the need to define the territorial limits of [ORG NATO  ] and its [ORG Article  ] 5 collective security obligations. <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( C ) Kosovo: This is an opportunity for the President to reaffirm Sarkozy’s commitment to an independent [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] has stated numerous times that he supports [MISC Kosovo’s  ] independence and has instructed FM [PER Kouchner  ] to actively seek [ORG EU  ] consensus on the matter . 
The [MISC French  ] also remind us from time to time that [LOC Kosovo  ] is a [MISC European  ] issue which [MISC Europeans  ] bear primary responsibility for solving . 
The [ORG GOF  ] is pessimistic that [LOC Serbia  ] and [LOC Kosovo  ] will come to a status agreement and is working closely with the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [ORG Contact Group  ] on post-December 10 actions . 
The [MISC French  ] remain concerned that while [ORG EU  ] member-states may agree to not publicly oppose [MISC Kosovo’s  ] independence , the [ORG EU  ] may fail to reach consensus on a legal basis for an [MISC ESDP  ] mission in [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
The [ORG GOF  ] has accepted [ORG UNSCR  ] 1244 as a basis for an international force in [LOC Kosovo  ] and agrees with the [LOC U.S.  ] that it would not be advantageous to seek a new [ORG UNSCR  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] lobbied [PER Putin  ] in [LOC Moscow  ] for more [MISC Russian  ] flexibility , but received no commitments . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG EU  ] , [PER Sarkozy  ] will argue , must publicly demonstrate that a good faith effort was made to come to an agreement . 
The [MISC French  ] are not prepared to recognize independence before the end of 2007 and are hopeful that the [LOC U.S.  ] will assist in convincing the Kosovars that it is in their interest to be patient with the [ORG EU  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] will likely ask that the [LOC U.S.  ] work closely with Kosovar authorities to take a coordinated ( [LOC U.S  ] , [ORG EU  ] , [LOC Kosovo  ] ) approach to [MISC Kosovo’s  ] now almost inevitable unilateral declaration of independence ( [ORG UDI  ] ) , and avoid dramatic rhetoric that will further embarrass [LOC Serbia  ] , encourage similar UDIs by [LOC Abkhazia  ] and [LOC South Ossetia  ] , and put internal political pressure on [ORG EU  ] states like [LOC Greece  ] and [LOC Cyprus  ] to publicly oppose [MISC Kosovo’s  ] [LOC PARIS  ] 00004357 009 OF 011 independence. <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( C ) [ORG Missile Defense:  ] The [MISC French  ] agree that [MISC Russia’s  ] objections to the planned system are politically driven , reflecting a [MISC Russian  ] view of its relationship with its former satellites that is at once “revisionist” but is also informed by real fears of [ORG NATO  ] encirclement . 
The [ORG GOF  ] is interested in [LOC U.S.  ] plans for [ORG NATO  ] to adopt a complementary system to protect the exposed southern flank of [LOC Europe  ] from short- and medium-range threat , although it has warned that there is “not one [MISC Euro”  ] allocated to pay for such a system . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] will be interested in learning of the status of [MISC U.S.-Russian  ] discussions and our analysis of prospects for bringing [LOC Moscow  ] around to support a cooperative effort . 
We should urge [PER Sarkozy  ] to use his leadership position in [LOC Europe  ] to promote understanding of the true nature and scope of the [LOC MD  ] initiative , one that in no way threatens [LOC Russia.  ] <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
( C ) [MISC CFE:  ] The [MISC French  ] government remains concerned over the [MISC Russian  ] threat to suspend participation in the [MISC Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces  ] in [LOC Europe  ] ( [LOC CFE  ] ) in December and strongly supports a unified Allied position in support of the [LOC U.S.  ] “parallel actions” plan . 
FM [PER Kouchner  ] recently wrote to Secretary Rice to propose an informal [LOC CFE  ] seminar in [LOC Paris  ] on [ORG SIPDIS  ] November 5-6 to promote constructive dialogue leading to a comprehensive political solution . 
These efforts are seen as key to keeping allied solidarity and building pressure on [LOC Russia  ] to recognize the consequences of pulling out of a major arms control treaty . 
Despite these efforts , the [MISC French  ] are increasingly pessimistic ; Political Director [PER Gerard Araud  ] was told recently in [LOC Moscow  ] that “the decision was already made” by [PER Putin  ] and the MOD to suspend participation , due in part to [MISC Russian  ] views that it is “humiliating” to have flank limits imposed on [MISC Russian  ] forces within its own borders . 
We should welcome [MISC French  ] initiatives to help resolve the [ORG CFE  ] issue and continue our close collaboration. <a id='par29' href='#par29'>¶</a>29 . 
( C ) Lebanon: [PER Sarkozy  ] has not been as closely associated as FM [PER Kouchner  ] with [MISC French  ] efforts to help [LOC Lebanon  ] elect a new president and emerge from its present political crisis , but he has played a key supporting role . 
Initially unimpressed with the March 14 majority leaders he met , [PER Sarkozy  ] ? s view of [PER Saad Hariri  ] has improved with subsequent meetings . 
After their last session , [PER Sarkozy  ] authorized announcement of [LOC France  ] ? s tranche of more than $6 million for the [ORG Special Tribunal  ] , which [LOC France  ] had been withholding pending a formal request for contributions by the [ORG UN  ] Secretary-General . 
Our close consultations with the [MISC French  ] [ORG SIPDIS  ] over [LOC Lebanon  ] continue , although we differ over tactics and the risks attached to any strategy that would allow the majority to elect a president via simple majority . 
The [MISC French  ] emphasize finding a “consensus” candidate acceptable to all [MISC Lebanese  ] and external parties and place more trust than we believe wise in [MISC Lebanese  ] parliamentary speaker [PER Nabih Berri  ] , despite his association with the pro-Syrian minority . 
While the [MISC French  ] have revived limited contact with [LOC Syria  ] to discuss [LOC Lebanon  ] , we do not believe they intend to go further at this stage . 
We will want to discuss with [PER Sarkozy  ] how to keep pressure on the [MISC Lebanese  ] to elect a president by the November 24 deadline without compromising the gains we have made over the past two years in terms of reducing [MISC Syrian  ] influence and reasserting [MISC Lebanese  ] independence . 
We will want to impress on him that the election of a President -- whether by majority of consensus -- by November 24 is a must ; fear of the repercussions of election of a President by a “mere” majority should not be ruled out if it is the only way to prevent a void that the [MISC Syrians  ] would only be too happy to fill. <a id='par30' href='#par30'>¶</a>30 . 
( C ) [LOC Middle East Peace  ] Process: [PER Sarkozy  ] will want to hear about our efforts to convene a regional meeting in support of [MISC Israeli/Palestinian  ] efforts at achieving a two-state solution . 
The [MISC French  ] have generally supported our efforts and not tried to get out in front . 
They are , [LOC PARIS  ] 00004357 010 OF 011 however , eager to play some sort of role . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] has taken to using his bona fides as a “friend of [MISC Israel”  ] to call on it for more “creativity” and “gestures” toward the [MISC Palestinians  ] in the run-up to the meeting . 
The [ORG GOF  ] recently announced its intention to host a donor’s conference for humanitarian assistance to help the [MISC Palestinian  ] people -- as an end in itself and in support of the political process . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] will mostly be in a listening mode , though as someone who has sought since taking office to underscore his readiness to listen at least as attentively to the [MISC Israeli  ] point of view as the [MISC Arab  ] one. <a id='par31' href='#par31'>¶</a>31 . 
( C ) France-EU: President [PER Sarkozy  ] was instrumental in re-activating the moribund political reform process in the [ORG European Union  ] with the June negotiation for a shortened “reform treaty” that will simplify some of the [MISC EU’s  ] operating procedures , while side-stepping efforts of deepened political integration that doomed the [ORG EU  ] constitution in 2005 . 
This “reform treaty” was approved by [ORG EU  ] leaders in [LOC Lisbon  ] last week and is scheduled to be signed in December with ratification over the course of 2008 . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] has said publicly he wants [LOC France  ] to be the first country to ratify the simplified treaty ; the process of parliamentary ratification will begin in December . 
The [MISC French  ] will also take over the rotating [ORG EU  ] presidency from July-December 2008 and plan to focus on immigration , energy , the environment and [MISC European  ] defense during their term . 
While [PER Sarkozy  ] remains firmly opposed to [ORG EU  ] enlargement to include [LOC Turkey  ] , he has effectively sidestepped this issue by supporting continued negotiations on the acquis communautaire that do not pre-suppose membership . 
He also conditioned his position on [ORG EU  ] support for a “Committee of [PER Wise Men”  ] to reflect “without taboos” on the broader questions about the [MISC European  ] future: i.e. , what is the [MISC European  ] identity , what should the [MISC EU’s  ] borders be , how to handle common issues , and how deep can political integration go. <a id='par32' href='#par32'>¶</a>32 . 
( C ) Colombia: [PER Sarkozy  ] promised during his presidential campaign to work for the release of [MISC Franco-Colombian  ] [ORG FARC  ] hostage [PER Ingrid Betancourt  ] . 
He would sorely like to be able to achieve in a few short months what [MISC Chirac  ] couldn’t despite years of effort . 
In June of this year , the [MISC French  ] pushed [MISC Colombian  ] President [PER Alvaro Uribe  ] to release 200 [ORG FARC  ] prisoners in an effort to move forward negotiations for the release of [ORG FARC  ] hostages . 
While the prisoner release did not achieve the desired results , the [MISC French  ] are now backing [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Hugo Chavez’s  ] offer to negotiate a hostage deal between the [MISC Colombian  ] government and [ORG FARC  ] guerillas . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] invited [PER Chavez  ] to [LOC Paris  ] in late November . 
The [MISC French  ] admit [PER Chavez  ] is a difficult political actor but accept a “bargain with the devil” to advance prospects for the release of an iconic hostage . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] may ask us to return two [ORG FARC  ] leaders in [LOC U.S.  ] prison to a third country in order to obtain the release of [MISC French  ] hostage . 
We should ask [PER Sarkozy  ] not to take any steps that would result in separate treatment for [PER Ingrid Betancourt  ] and put [LOC U.S.  ] hostages in harm’s way. <a id='par33' href='#par33'>¶</a>33 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) GMO Moratorium: When [PER Sarkozy  ] came into office not only did he create a ‘mega’ environment ministry , but he also directed it to undertake a process , the ‘Grenelle’ , involving all sectors of the economy to reshape [MISC French  ] environmental policies . 
Among the topics considered in the [LOC Grenelle  ] was what to do about [ORG Genetically Modified Organisms  ] , a subject of considerable domestic concern in [LOC France  ] . 
The result is that [LOC France  ] is currently considering a moratorium on biotech planting that would significantly undermine [LOC U.S.  ] agricultural exports to [LOC Europe  ] . 
We believe President [PER Sarkozy  ] may support the politically popular moratorium in order to gain capital to use in his reform efforts. <a id='par34' href='#par34'>¶</a>34 . 
( C ) [ORG Darfur  ] ( and [LOC Chad  ] , [LOC Central African Republic  ] ) : [PER Sarkozy  ] demonstrated an immediate renewed interest in [LOC Africa  ] [LOC PARIS  ] 00004357 011 OF 011 upon entering office , with [LOC France  ] calling for and organizing the June 25 ministerial conference on [ORG Darfur  ] , which served to refocus international attention on that country . 
The [MISC French  ] followed up with a ministerial meeting on [ORG Darfur  ] on the margins of the [LOC UNGA  ] in [LOC New York  ] in September and then hosted a broader [ORG Security Council  ] session on [LOC Africa  ] for heads-of-state/government . 
[LOC France  ] has been instrumental in organizing a separate [ORG Security Council-blessed  ] EU-UN peacekeeping mission in [LOC Chad  ] and the [LOC Central African Republic  ] ( [MISC MINURCAT  ] ) . 
[LOC Paris  ] hopes to deploy this force as soon as practicable . 
In addition , the [MISC French  ] have firmly supported the deployment of the hybrid [MISC UN-AU  ] force in [ORG Darfur  ] ( [ORG UNAMID  ] ) . 
We should thank [PER Sarkozy  ] for [MISC French  ] leadership on [LOC Chad  ] and the [LOC C.A.R.  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] may ask for enhanced [LOC U.S.  ] financial contributions to [MISC MINURCAT  ] .
