Allegrone  ] , for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) SUMMARY: President [PER Sarkozy  ] 's [ORG Strategic Affairs Advisor  ] Franois [PER Richier  ] and MFA Middle East Director ( A/S equivalent ) [PER Patrice Paoli  ] told Political Minister Counselor in separate meetings August 11 that the [MISC French  ] approached their hostage situations in [LOC Iran  ] by first seeking an immediate , behind-the-scenes resolution before the [MISC Iranians  ] brought charges against their captives , and then , once that approach failed , by adopting a two-pronged strategy: ( 1 ) relentlessly publicizing the cases with repeated employment of key words chosen carefully to put the [MISC Iranians  ] on the defensive , and ( 2 ) constant exertion of diplomatic and political pressure , with the help of allies , in the form of regular demarches in [LOC Tehran  ] and convocations of [MISC Iranian  ] Ambassadors in [MISC European  ] and Middle Eastern capitals . 
[PER Paoli  ] and [PER Richier  ] predicted that the [MISC Iranians  ] will advise us , via the [MISC Swiss  ] , to remain calm and quiet while waiting for [MISC Iranian  ] legal procedures to move forward . 
Ignore this warning , they insisted , because silence will not expedite the process . 
They argued that [ORG USG  ] statements and actions can sway and even mobilize public opinion within [LOC Iran  ] . 
Whether or not we choose to speak out , they warned , the [MISC Iranians  ] will energetically disseminate fabricated accusations . 
As the [ORG USG  ] seeks to engage the [MISC Iranians  ] , [PER Richier  ] predicted it will be difficult to determine which [MISC Iranian  ] institution currently has control of [MISC American  ] hostages and , more importantly , which one has the authority to decide their fate . 
The [MISC French  ] still have not identified a key broker within the [MISC Iranian  ] government with the power to resolve their own hostage cases. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) SUMMARY ( CONT'D ) : [PER Paoli  ] and [PER Richier  ] also warned of possible [MISC Iranian  ] efforts to blackmail the [ORG USG  ] . 
They may try , for instance , to drag out the cases of the [MISC American  ] and [MISC French  ] hostages through the [MISC US/EU  ] late September deadline for a response from the regime on the nuclear issue . 
[PER Richier  ] said the [MISC French  ] believe this familiar [MISC Iranian  ] tactic -- hostage-taking as political blackmail -- will only increase in the near future . 
The [MISC Iranians  ] may also seek specific exchanges , such as the release from [MISC French  ] custody of [PER Majid Kakavand  ] , an [MISC Iranian  ] national whom the [MISC French  ] arrested March 20 at [LOC Charles de Gaulle  ] airport on the behalf of the [ORG U.S. Department of Justice  ] on proliferation issues . 
Overall , as the [ORG USG  ] prepares to handle its hostage cases , the [MISC French  ] recommended we prepare for uncertainty . 
In the face of unpredictable [MISC Iranian  ] behavior , [PER Paoli  ] and [PER Richier  ] said that constant pressure from foreign leaders and the media appears to be the only means to accelerate decision-making in [LOC Tehran  ] . 
They also reported that the [ORG EU  ] has no plans at the moment to recall its Ambassadors from [LOC Iran  ] . 
END SUMMARY . 
[ORG STEP  ] 1: SEEK BEHIND-THE-SCENES RESOLUTION ----------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) Franois [PER Richier  ] and [PER Patrice Paoli  ] told the Political Minister Counselor that each time they learned of the arrest of their citizens in [LOC Iran  ] , the [ORG GOF  ] sought their immediate release through discrete but direct contact with [MISC Iranian  ] officials . 
( [PER NOTE: Richier  ] was accompanied by Mr. Lioutaud from the [ORG Office of French National Intelligence Coordinator  ] , [PER Bernard Bajolet  ] ( equivalent to our Director of [ORG National Intelligence  ] ) . 
END NOTE . 
) They hoped to act quickly enough to prevent the regime from pressing formal charges . 
Once the [MISC Iranians  ] refused to release the prisoners , [PER Paoli  ] said , the prosecutors publicized the charges and began preparations for a public trial . 
A trial seems to be a pre-condition for the release of foreign detainees in [LOC Iran  ] , whom the [MISC French  ] described as " hostages " held in order to achieve political goals . 
[ORG STEP  ] 2: USE THE MEDIA TO PUT IRANIANS ON DEFENSIVE --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) Once the quiet approach failed , the [MISC French  ] launched a relentless public relations strategy . 
They did not merely wait for questions from the press ; instead , they made frequent pronouncements of their own about the hostages . 
They publicized the cases with repeated use of key words chosen carefully to put the regime on the defensive by influencing [MISC Iranian  ] public opinion . 
[PER Paoli  ] and [PER Richier  ] emphasized the susceptibility of the [MISC Iranian  ] population to messages sent through the media . 
[ORG USG  ] public statements can sway and even mobilize public opinion within [LOC Iran  ] , they claimed , especially in the post-election environment. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) In their statements , the [MISC French  ] repeatedly employed key words to focus attention on the rights of detainees , and on [MISC Iranian  ] legal commitments to respect those rights , such as " basic human rights , " " good treatment , " " [MISC Vienna Convention  ] . 
" They also used words to refute the regime 's false accusations , like " innocent , " " baseless , " and " immediate release . 
" [PER Paoli  ] said the [MISC French  ] have deliberately avoided using the word " negotiation " when describing their contact with [MISC Iranian  ] leaders: " We demand only their immediate liberation ; we do not negotiate for the release of innocent civilians . 
" ( [PER NOTE: Paoli  ] said he strongly regretted the mistaken use of the word " negotiate " recently by a [ORG GOF  ] spokesman . 
END NOTE . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) Moreover , the [MISC French  ] predicted that the [MISC Iranians  ] will advise us , via the [MISC Swiss  ] , to remain calm and quiet . 
They will imply that the cases will be resolved more quickly if we just wait for the [MISC Iranian  ] legal procedures to move forward . 
Ignore this warning , [PER Richier  ] and [PER Paoli  ] insisted . 
" Be vocal , " [PER Richier  ] advised , " even more so if the [MISC Iranians  ] ask you not to be , " because silence will not expedite the process . 
" They are the masters of stalling tactics , " [PER Paoli  ] said . 
Whether or not we choose to remain silent about the cases , the [MISC Iranians  ] will launch a media blitz . 
They will energetically disseminate fabricated accusations about their captives , [PER Richier  ] predicted . 
[PER Paoli  ] and [PER Richier  ] both acknowledged that an aggressive [ORG USG  ] public posture involves risks as well , as it will " increase the value " of the hostages to [MISC Iranian  ] leaders . 
Nonetheless , they said they still believe that public pressure , on balance , will prove more effective than behind-the-scenes engagement . 
Ideally , both public statements and private discussions can take place simultaneously . 
[ORG STEP  ] 3: CALL ON ALLIES ( AND OTHERS ) TO PRESSURE [LOC IRAN  ] --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) [PER Paoli  ] and [PER Richier  ] advocated the constant exertion of diplomatic and political pressure on the [MISC Iranian  ] regime . 
Recognizing the central role of the wiss protecting power , they suggested the [ORG USG  ] enlist the help of other allies as well , in the form of regular demarches in [LOC Tehran  ] and convocations of [MISC Iranian  ] leaders in capitals around the world . 
[PER Paoli  ] explicitly stated that [LOC France  ] would be willing to weigh in , if asked . 
[PER Richier  ] explained that the [MISC French  ] approached [LOC Syria  ] almost immediately after they learned [MISC French  ] citizien [PER Clotilde Reiss  ] had been arrested on July 1 . 
He then previewed the presidential communiqu about the release of the [MISC French  ] Embassy employee , [PER Nazak Afshar  ] , in which the [MISC French  ] explicitly thanked the [MISC Syrians  ] for their help . 
" Of course we don't know if the [MISC Syrians  ] did anything , " [PER Richier  ] admitted , " but we wanted to thank them anyway . 
It should at least confuse the [MISC Iranians  ] . 
" He said the [MISC French  ] did not/not reach out to [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC China  ] for assistance , but he and [PER Paoli  ] both argued that the support of [ORG EU  ] and other countries had a major impact on [MISC Iranian  ] leaders . 
The [MISC French  ] have coordinated closely with the [MISC British  ] , [PER Richier  ] said , though primarily on the ground in [LOC Tehran  ] . 
He suggested the [ORG USG  ] consider approaching other countries , including relatively disinterested allies such as [LOC Brazil  ] , and ask them to lean on the [MISC Iranians  ] . 
He also mentioned the potential impact of blogs written by [MISC Iranian  ] ex-patriates in the [LOC U.S.  ] GOOD LUCK FIGURING OUT WHO IS IN CHARGE IN [LOC TEHRAN  ] --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) [PER Richier  ] predicted it will be difficult to determine which [MISC Iranian  ] institution currently has control of the [LOC U.S.  ] hostages and , more importantly , which one has the authority to decide their fate . 
The [MISC French  ] still have not identified a key broker within the [MISC Iranian  ] government with the power to resolve their own hostage cases . 
They learned that the deliberative procedures of [MISC Iranian  ] institutions remain unusually opaque . 
BE PREPARED FOR POLITICAL BLACKMAIL ----------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) [PER Richier  ] said the [MISC Iranians  ] have in the past tried to " blackmail " them , trading release of a [MISC French  ] national for an [MISC Iranian  ] national . 
He warned of possible [MISC Iranian  ] efforts to blackmail the [ORG USG  ] . 
The [MISC Iranians  ] may try , for instance , to drag out the cases of the [MISC American  ] and [MISC French  ] hostages through the [MISC US/EU  ] late September deadline for a response from the regime on the nuclear issue . 
[PER Richier  ] said the [MISC French  ] believe this familiar [MISC Iranian  ] tactic -- hostage-taking as political blackmail -- will only increase in the near future. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) The [MISC Iranians  ] may also seek specific exchanges , such as the release from [MISC French  ] custody of [PER Majid Kakavand  ] . 
Without going into details , [PER Richier  ] said [PER Kakavand  ] had been apprehended by the [MISC French  ] and was under a [LOC U.S.  ] extradition request . 
He noted that [ORG GOF  ] officials had briefed President [PER Sarkozy  ] on this case and that the [MISC French  ] are prepared to continue holding him . 
( Background from Embassy Justice Attache: [PER Kakavand  ] is an [MISC Iranian  ] national whom the [MISC French  ] arrested March 20 at [LOC Charles de Gaulle  ] airport on behalf of the [ORG Department of Justice for  ] extradition to the [LOC U.S.  ] on export control ( proliferation ) charges . 
) Then again , [PER Richier  ] noted , it is possible that the [MISC Iranian  ] agency or agencies holding [MISC American  ] citizens may not be aware of [PER Kakavand  ] , or may have no interest in his release ; it is simply impossible to predict how their bureaucracies will behave. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S ) [PER Paoli  ] said the [MISC French  ] knew the [MISC Iranians  ] intended to use the arrest of [PER Clotilde Reiss  ] and [PER Nazak Afshar  ] as a means to punish the [MISC French  ] for their criticism of [LOC Iran  ] 's recent election results . 
More importantly , the [MISC Iranians  ] hoped to muzzle future [MISC French  ] criticism: " They want to paralyze us , " [PER Paoli  ] said , explaining that the [MISC Iranians  ] had failed in this attempt . 
Of course , he added , the regime also wanted to use [MISC French  ] and [MISC British  ] hostages to validate their allegation that foreign agents organized the mass post-election protests . 
[PER Paoli  ] and [PER Richier  ] both reported that the [MISC Iranians  ] continue to harass and intimidate the local employees of their Embassy in [LOC Tehran  ] . 
They described the burden on resources required to respond to each arrest: " The time we have had to devote to this is absolutely ridiculous , " [PER Richier  ] said . 
ADAPT YOUR APPROACH FOR EACH HOSTAGE ------------------------------------ <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( S ) Before offering accounts of the [MISC French  ] experience with hostages in [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Richier  ] and [PER Paoli  ] were both at pains to avoid offering any absolute advice . 
They noted significant differences in the cases of [PER Stephane Lherbier  ] , [PER Reiss  ] , [PER Afshar  ] , the [MISC Americans  ] captured near the border with [LOC Kurdistan  ] , and other [MISC U.S.-Iranian  ] dual nationals currently in custody . 
[PER Paoli  ] said the [MISC French  ] made a concerted , and successful , effort to keep the case of [PER Stephane Lherbier  ] " apolitical . 
" ( [PER NOTE: Lherbier  ] , a [MISC French  ] fisherman arrested by the [MISC Iranians  ] in 2006 , spent almost a year in prison prior to his release in 2007 . 
END NOTE . 
) Since the [MISC Iranians  ] have already accused the [MISC French  ] and [MISC British  ] hostages of espionage , [PER Paoli  ] and [PER Richier  ] suggested the [ORG USG  ] make strenuous efforts to distance those cases from the situation of the [LOC U.S.  ] hikers currently in captivity . 
Moreover , in 2007 , [MISC Iranian  ] leaders did not perceive the [MISC French  ] as negatively as they do now , which they said has further complicated the recent hostage cases . 
[PER Richier  ] and [PER Paoli  ] both warned that the [ORG USG  ] must make every effort to dissuade the [MISC Iranians  ] from politicizing the case of the [MISC American  ] hikers ; thus far , they noted , [MISC Iranian  ] officials have not formally linked them to the case against opposition members and the [MISC British  ] and [MISC French  ] hostages . 
[PER Richier  ] reported that the [MISC French  ] found the [MISC Iranian  ] " system " to be " perverse and complex but stable " in 2006 , when seeking the release of [PER Lherbier  ] . 
" Now it is still perverse and complex , " [PER Richier  ] said , " but unstable , and this makes everything more difficult . 
" BRACE FOR UNCERTAINTY --------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( S ) [PER Paoli  ] stressed in particular the uncertain and unpredictable nature of [MISC French  ] dealings with [LOC Iran  ] in hostage situations . 
There are no procedural certainties , and the timing of various steps appears arbitrary . 
Progress toward a trial could take months , depending on variables such as the political environment and the whims of key actors inside [MISC Iranian  ] institutions . 
" Anything is possible and we know next to nothing , " [PER Paoli  ] said , citing the recent arrest and quick release of a [MISC French  ] citizen who told [MISC Iranian  ] provincial police he was a researcher following the paths of the dinosaurs . 
In the face of this uncertainty , [PER Paoli  ] and [PER Richier  ] said that constant pressure from foreign leaders and the media appears to be the only means to accelerate decision-making in [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( S ) [PER Paoli  ] and [PER Richier  ] described their continuing uncertainty about the case of [PER Clotilde Reiss  ] . 
They both stopped short of confirming that she would soon be transferred from [LOC Evin  ] prison to the [MISC French  ] Embassy in [LOC Tehran  ] , although they expressed strong optimism . 
[PER Richier  ] added that this step will require the [ORG GOF  ] to pay the [MISC Iranians  ] a large sum , to ensure that [PER Reiss  ] stays in the country pending further legal action against her ( reftel ) . 
[PER Richier  ] would not say whether the [MISC French  ] will permit the [MISC Iranians  ] to take [PER Reiss  ] back to court , or to prison: " We're focused on our short-term objective right now -- getting her out of jail . 
" He said that the [MISC French  ] worry the [MISC Iranians  ] could decide to arrest in the near future another one of the approximately 1,800 [MISC French  ] citizens living in [LOC Iran  ] . 
[ORG EU  ] HAS NO PLANS TO RECALL AMBASSADORS ------------------------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( S ) [PER Paoli  ] noted that the [ORG EU  ] relations with [LOC Iran  ] are extremely tense at the moment . 
He said the [MISC Iranians  ] currently refuse to receive the [MISC Swedish  ] Ambassador , even in his capacity as representative of the [ORG EU  ] Presidency . 
Nonetheless , barring extreme actions by the [MISC Iranians  ] , such as expulsion of one of the [ORG EU  ] Ambassadors , [PER Paoli  ] predicted that the [ORG EU  ] will not/not decide to withdraw its Ambassadors from [LOC Tehran  ] . 
( NOTE: Deputy MFA Middle East Director ( PDAS equivalent ) [PER Jean-Franois Paucelle  ] provided background on this issue in an earlier meeting . 
He served as [MISC French  ] Charge d'Affairs in [LOC Tehran  ] in 1997 , after the [ORG EU  ] withdrew its Ambassadors to protest the assassination in [LOC Berlin  ] , by [MISC Iranian  ] government agents , of four members of the [MISC Iranian  ] opposition-in-exile . 
[MISC European  ] Embassies , after their Ambassadors had departed , soon learned that [MISC Iranian  ] officials refused to receive [MISC European  ] Charges d'Affaires , and so all communication between [ORG EU  ] members and [LOC Iran  ] slowed down or halted altogether . 
The [MISC Europeans  ] also realized that the politics of returning Ambassadors to [LOC Iran  ] can become complex . 
Following the withdrawal of their Ambassadors at present , [PER Paucelle  ] said , the [MISC Europeans  ] would need to determine ahead of time when and under what conditions they would return . 
Possible criteria range widely , from returning the Ambassadors after the regime changes , as a long-term deadline , to after the release of [PER Clotilde Reiss  ] , as the shortest possible window . 
In addition , after the [ORG EU  ] decided to return its Ambassadors in 1997 , the [MISC Iranians  ] refused to allow some of them to return , in an attempt to sow division among [ORG EU  ] members . 
This chastening experience , [PER Paucelle  ] said , continues to inform [ORG EU  ] discussions about whether or not to recall their Ambassadors from [LOC Iran  ] .
