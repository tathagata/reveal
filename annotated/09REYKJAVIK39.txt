( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Iceland  ] 's [ORG Central Bank  ] Chairman of [ORG Board of Governors  ] [PER David Oddsson  ] refused to accept blame for the October bank collapse and subsequent economic recession during his appearance on [ORG Icelandic State Television  ] 's current affairs program " [MISC Kastljos  ] " on February <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
Well-prepared and often portraying himself as a victim , [PER Oddsson  ] confronted the interviewer from the start of the program by refuting the assertion that he did not have the trust of the public: [PER Oddsson  ] called a recent poll stating that 90 percent of Icelanders want him to resign as inaccurate . 
The embattled [ORG Central Bank  ] Chairman continually returned to three main themes throughout the interview: 1 ) he and the [ORG Central Bank  ] had repeatedly warned the [PER Haarde  ] administration about the state of the [MISC Icelandic  ] banking system ; 2 ) the fault of the collapse lies with the [PER Haarde  ] government , and the banks themselves ; and 3 ) the [ORG Central Bank  ] has kept the economy afloat after the crash and he and the institution enjoy the trust of the people and international community. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Oddsson  ] supported his points by quoting passages from several [ORG Bank  ] reports warning the government of the impending crisis ( but declined to release the documents . 
) He said that he was confident a full investigation into the cause of the banks crash would exonerate him and the [ORG Central Bank  ] . 
When asked why he does not step down and allow the rebuilding process to fully begin , [PER Oddsson  ] declared that he is still trusted in his position . 
The interviewer read a list of domestic politicians , economists , and foreign experts who have called for [PER Oddsson  ] 's resignation to restore trust in the [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG Central Bank  ] ; [PER Oddsson  ] responded that those individuals had either a hidden agenda or were not familiar with international economic policy . 
He called the current Prime Minister 's [ORG Central Bank  ] reform bill , which restructures the [ORG Bank  ] 's leadership to eliminate [PER Oddsson  ] 's position , " nonsense " and accused the PM of settling an old political score . 
[PER Oddsson  ] said the [ORG Central Bank  ] has kept the economy afloat in the wake of the crash and that it was the [ORG Central Bank  ] that foreign creditors trusted to insure transactions . 
Finally , when asked if he would entertain the idea of re-entering the political area , [PER Oddsson  ] noted that he had no intention of returning to politics . 
Speculation in [LOC Iceland  ] , however , is that [PER Oddsson  ] was using the interview as a platform to reignite his political career. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: [PER Oddsson  ] 's performance on [MISC Kastljos  ] was political theater at its most florid , confirming [PER Oddsson  ] sees himself as the last great bulwark standing up to a destructive and incompetent government economic and financial structure . 
Those close to former PM and departing [MISC IP Chair  ] Geir [ORG Haarde  ] have marveled at [PER Oddsson  ] 's stubborn determination and his disregard for the damage his continued tenure is causing the [MISC IP  ] . 
This was clearly evident in his willingness to publically blame [PER Haarde  ] and his government for [LOC Iceland  ] 's economic collapse - and this despite the fact that [PER Haarde  ] 's refusal to fire [PER Oddsson  ] , his old friend and mentor , was one of the chief reasons for the fall of the previous government . 
[PER Oddsson  ] is correct in his assessment that most of the provisions in the proposed new [ORG Central Bank  ] law are directed at him personally . 
What he did not acknowledge is that his continued presence at the [ORG Bank  ] has become a severe distraction as the economic crisis deepens . 
[PER Oddsson  ] is now such a polarizing figure that we doubt any government can concentrate on [LOC Iceland  ] 's reconstruction while he remains at the [ORG Central Bank  ] . 
[PER Oddsson  ] left no one in doubt last night that he will continue to run rings around the interim government as he fights off attempts to separate him from the job . 
Not for nothing was [PER Oddsson  ] the most charismatic , crafty , and resourceful politician in [LOC Iceland  ] 's recent history . 
The question is whether that old magic will work with a battered people looking for answers as to how their economy fell so far so swiftly , and hungry for new political leadership able to point the way out of the catastrophe .
