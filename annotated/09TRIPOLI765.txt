( C ) Summary: Acting Chairman of [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG National Oil Corporation  ] , [PER Ali Sugheir  ] , insisted that in spite of the resignation of former Chairman [PER Shukri Ghanem  ] , business operations would continue as usual . 
[PER Sugheir  ] did not know when a new chairman would be appointed but did not expect operations to change at all in the interim , as [PER Sugheir  ] personally had been directing the company 's operations as General Director for the last three years . 
To that end , [PER Sugheir  ] outlined plans to create a new joint venture with [ORG ENI  ] to export eight billion cubic meters ( bcm ) of gas per year , to expand the [MISC Greenstream  ] pipeline capacity , and to develop a new [ORG Liquefied Natural Gas  ] facility capable of producing five bcms per year . 
[PER Sugheir  ] also confirmed [ORG GOL  ] plans to establish a new General People 's [ORG Committee  ] ( Ministry-equivalent ) for Energy , which will take charge of [LOC Libya  ] 's oil , gas , electricity , nuclear and solar energy , and environmental sectors . 
End Summary . 
AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS , [ORG NOC  ] CHIEF SUCCESSFULLY RESIGNS 2 . 
( C ) During a September 15 meeting with P/E Chief , the Acting Chairman and General Director of [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG National Oil Corporation  ] ( [ORG NOC  ] ) , [PER Ali Sugheir  ] , confirmed that [PER Shukri Ghanem  ] had resigned from his position as Chairman of the [ORG NOC  ] - a position [PER Ghanem  ] had held since 2005 . 
[PER Sugheir  ] said he was not at liberty to discuss the reason for [PER Ghanem  ] 's resignation , the timing of which was considered unusual by several General Manager 's of [ORG International Oil Companies  ] ( [ORG IOC  ] ) represented in [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
However , [PER Sugheir  ] insisted that the [ORG NOC  ] would continue operating as usual . 
He said that as General Director of the [ORG NOC  ] , he was already in charge of daily operations - even under [PER Ghanem  ] - and that the company 's direction would not change simply because the chairman had departed . 
He explained that his colleague , [PER Azzam Ali  ] al-Mesallati , would also continue in his role as head of investment and joint ventures . 
[ Note: Many observers believe al-Mesallati will be named [ORG NOC  ] Chairman in [PER Ghanem  ] 's place . 
End Note . 
] " We are moving forward with business as usual , " [PER Sugheir  ] stated , " you will see no difference in our operations from the outside . 
" 3 . 
( C ) Numerous explanations surround [PER Shukri Ghanem  ] 's August 25 resignation . 
An August 27 article published by independent foreign-based website " [LOC Libya  ] al [MISC Youm  ] " reported that [PER Ghanem  ] resigned in protest of policies generated by Prime Minister al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi. xxxxxxxxxxxx BUSINESS AS USUAL - DEVELOPING LIBYA'S GAS SECTOR 4 . 
( C ) As an example of moving forward with business as usual , [PER Sugheir  ] discussed his work to develop [LOC Libya  ] 's gas sector , sharing his long-term vision of transforming [LOC Libya  ] into a hub for gas exports , to [LOC Europe  ] and across the region . 
To that end , the [ORG NOC  ] is developing a gas network from [LOC East Benghazi  ] ( 650 miles east of [LOC Tripoli  ] ) to [ORG Mellitah  ] ( 60 miles west of [LOC Tripoli  ] ) that will eventually transport more than 400 million cubic meters of gas . 
Additionally the [ORG Sirte Oil Company  ] ( state-run ) is extracting gas from the [LOC Marsa  ] al [LOC Brega  ] field ( from which the [MISC Esso  ] company pulled out in 1983 ) for transport to [LOC Benghazi  ] , 480 miles eastward , and further eastward along the coast to the city of [LOC al-Khums  ] . 
5 . 
( C ) In the west , [PER Sugheir  ] explained that the [ORG Mellitah Oil and Gas B.V.  ] company , a joint venture between the [ORG NOC  ] and the [MISC Italian  ] company [ORG ENI  ] , is extracting gas from [PER Al Wafah  ] field ( 60 miles west of [LOC Tripoli  ] ) and transporting it via its [MISC Greenstream  ] pipeline to [ORG Mellitah  ] for export and domestic consumption . 
[ Note: The [MISC Greenstream  ] pipeline came on-stream in September 2004 . 
End Note . 
] The joint-venture exports 8 billion cubic meters ( bcm ) per year across the [MISC Mediterranean  ] and supplies 2 bcms per year to the [MISC Libyan  ] domestic market . 
To achieve an [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000765 002.2 OF 003 additional transport capacity of 3 bcms per year , [ORG Mellitah Oil and Gas B.V.  ] is expanding the [MISC Greenstream  ] pipeline . 
The firm is also constructing a new [ORG Liquefied Natural Gas  ] ( [ORG LNG  ] ) facility at [ORG Mellitah  ] designed to produce 5 bcms per year of [ORG LNG  ] to be marketed worldwide . 
[ Note: [ORG Mellitah Oil and Gas B.V.  ] also produces 420,000 barrels of oil per day , and [ORG ENI  ] is entitled to 12% of produced oil and 40% of natural gas extracted . 
End note . 
] 6 . 
( C ) According to [PER Sugheir  ] , the [ORG NOC  ] is also currently working on a project to provide gas to all electric , cement , and steel factories throughout [LOC Libya  ] via pipelines that are being developed by the [ORG Sirte Oil Company  ] . 
He said that the [ORG NOC  ] had adopted a [MISC European  ] model for its gas exploration activities , which he described as a " no-waste " policy . 
[PER Sugheir  ] estimated that over 25 million cubic meters of gas had been flared ( i.e. , wasted ) over the last twenty years - his new policy was designed to ensure that gas flaring activities were minimized . 
He said that the [ORG NOC  ] was working in coordination with other government bodies to develop an overall strategic gas policy , which would include plans for further development of the sector , as well as gas pricing strategies . 
[LOC LIBYA  ] STILL INVESTING IN NEW OIL EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES 7 . 
( C ) To counter criticism that many companies had downsized or closed operations because most new oil exploration activities in [MISC Libyan  ] fields had not produced , [PER Sugheir  ] blamed the global economic crisis , claiming that many of the new fields were still in the early stages of development and would not be ready for production for three or four more years . 
He cited a recent discovery by the [ORG Waha Group  ] ( a joint-venture that includes [LOC U.S.  ] companies [ORG Marathon  ] , [ORG Amerada-Hess  ] , and [ORG Conoco-Phillips  ] ) in the [LOC Jalo  ] field in the [LOC Sirte Basin  ] ( 400 miles south of [LOC Benghazi  ] ) as evidence that new exploration activities were worthwhile . 
[ Note: The discovery at [LOC Jalo  ] field , which lies on the southern end of the [LOC Sirte Basin  ] , was unsurprising given the area 's proven reserves . 
End note . 
] [PER Sugheir  ] also described a " huge " [ORG NOC  ] project to develop an international oil pipeline that would connect the cities of [LOC al-Khums  ] , [LOC Tripoli  ] , and [ORG Mellitah  ] and would eventually be a source for increased exports to [LOC Europe  ] . 
He said that five major sedimentary basins with oil and gas resources had been discovered in [LOC Libya  ] and that seismic data suggested that much more remained to be discovered across the country . 
Most areas in [LOC Libya  ] , he stated , were still underexplored . 
[PER Sugheir  ] insisted that the [ORG GOL  ] 's goal of producing 3 million barrels of oil per day by 2012 was still feasible . 
NEW MINISTRY OF ENERGY TO BE CREATED 8 . 
( C ) In other energy-related news , [PER Sugheir  ] confirmed that the [ORG GOL  ] was in the process of establishing a new General People 's Committee ( Ministry-equivalent ) for Energy , which will direct [LOC Libya  ] 's oil , gas , electricity , nuclear and solar energy , and environmental sectors . 
The new ministry will also promote joint ventures between the [ORG GOL  ] and private local and foreign companies in the aforementioned sectors . 
[PER Sugheir  ] claimed that the idea of a Ministry of Energy was not new , and in fact , the ministry would represent the reincarnation of a previous energy structure that had existed in the past . 
[ Note: An informal energy council already exists , comprised of the Ministers for Transport , Manpower , and [ORG Economy  ] , [ORG NOC  ] representatives , and members of [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG National Security Council  ] . 
End note . 
] 9 . 
( C/NF ) [ORG Bio  ] note: [PER Ali Mohamad Salah Al Sugheir  ] has served as [MISC Vice-Chairman  ] and General Director of [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG National Oil Corporation  ] since 2006 . 
Prior to this , he served as chairman of the [ORG Sirte Oil Company  ] , the most important of the [ORG NOC  ] 's subsidiaries , a position to which he was appointed after a short stint as exploration manager . 
A graduate of [ORG Glasgow University  ] , [PER Sugheir  ] speaks [MISC Arabic  ] and fluent [MISC English  ] . 
During the meeting with P/E Chief , he was charismatic , confident , and engaging , and he seemed personally proud of the [ORG NOC  ] 's initiatives to expand its gas exploration activities . 
While he accepted a meeting easily by phone with P/E Chief , he emphasized that a meeting with the Ambassador must be requested officially through [MISC MFA Protocol  ] . 
Although the meeting took place during [PER Ramadan  ] - the [MISC Islamic  ] holy month during which [MISC Muslims  ] are called to fast - [PER Sugheir  ] asked if he could open and begin eating a box of candy that P/E Chief delivered in honor of Eid . 
He refrained when a [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000765 003.2 OF 003 colleague quietly mentioned [PER Ramadan  ] . 
10 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Ghanem  ] 's resignation was not unexpected ; xxxxxxxxxxxx . 
More recently , [PER Ghanem  ] had been tasked with collecting funds to pay for the lavish celebrations marking the 40th anniversary of [PER Qadhafi  ] 's coup . 
( A manager at Total claims that the [ORG NOC  ] has ordered a 100-thousand barrel per day increase to recoup funds for the gala event . 
) As March and September ( General People 's [ORG Congresses  ] and [ORG Revolution Day  ] , respectively ) are customary windows for high-level personnel changes , the September 1 window may have been the chance [PER Ghanem  ] was looking for to get out xxxxxxxxxxxx . 
Regardless of the reason for the resignation , [PER Ali Sugheir  ] - who does not seem as encumbered as [PER Ghanem  ] by reformist ideals - does not intend to waste time wondering who will replace the chairman . 
[PER Sugheir  ] 's plans to move forward with expanding [LOC Libya  ] 's gas sector are robust , and if successful , could provide the [ORG GOL  ] with another large source of income to fill in the gaps for any losses in the oil sector .
