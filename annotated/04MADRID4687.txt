( C ) [PER Leon  ] said that [LOC Spain  ] is politically divided at the moment , as demonstrated by the [ORG PP  ] 's decision to adopt an aggressive posture towards the [ORG GOS  ] in hopes of bringing down the government and forcing early elections . 
He claimed that [ORG PP  ] leaders , including former President [PER Aznar  ] and former FM [PER Ana Palacio  ] , were trying to use their contacts in [LOC Washington  ] to shape [ORG USG  ] opinion against [PER Zapatero  ] . 
The [ORG PP  ] 's objective , he said , is to use bilateral friction between the [ORG USG  ] and the [ORG GOS  ] as part of its campaign to unseat FM [MISC Moratinos  ] , and eventually [PER Zapatero  ] . 
[PER Leon  ] said it was important for [ORG USG  ] officials , such as [PER A/S Noriega  ] , to understand that even comments in seemingly innocuous settings can get picked up by the press and have an impact far beyond that intended by the speaker. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Charge noted that we had been sending an identical message to [ORG GOS  ] officials , with mixed success . 
For example , the visit of [ORG King Juan Carlos  ] sent an excellent , positive message regarding the importance of our bilateral relations , but the positive effect had been negated by the simultaneous visit of [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Chavez  ] to [ORG Madrid  ] . 
All of the good news from the [ORG King  ] 's visit was drowned out by three days of [LOC Chavez'  ] revolutionary rhetoric and tirades against the [ORG USG  ] while standing next to [MISC Spanish  ] officials. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Leon  ] agreed that the [PER Chavez  ] visit had been a public relations failure , adding that the [ORG GOS  ] only invited [PER Chavez  ] after months of requests from [PER Chavez  ] . 
Turning to the [ORG King  ] 's meeting with President [PER Bush  ] , [PER Leon  ] said that there might be some " misunderstandings " on the part of the [ORG USG  ] regarding the [ORG GOS  ] . 
He said that when [ORG King Juan Carlos  ] had raised [LOC Spain  ] 's exclusion from November [LOC White House  ] briefings on the [LOC Middle East  ] to which other [MISC European  ] ( [MISC G-8  ] ) countries had been invited , President [PER Bush  ] , the [ORG King  ] said , expressed surprise and reassured the [ORG King  ] that [LOC Spain  ] would be invited to future such meetings .
