( C ) Summary: The [ORG Socialist Workers Party of Spain  ] ( [ORG PSOE  ] ) , surprise victor in March 14 elections , is a center-left party in the [MISC European  ] social democrat tradition . 
Since the end of the [MISC Franco  ] regime and the beginning of [LOC Spain  ] 's modern democracy in 1977 , [ORG PSOE  ] has generally advocated comprehensive social programs and limited defense spending , as well as a reduced domestic role for the armed forces . 
In practical terms , members of [PER Zapatero  ] 's inner circle have been careful to say [ORG PSOE  ] will make no significant changes to the [ORG Aznar  ] government 's successful economic policies . 
We expect static or reduced defense spending under [ORG PSOE  ] , increased social welfare programs , more " green " environment policies , a greater focus on [LOC Spain  ] 's role in the [ORG EU  ] ( including increased adherence to [MISC French  ] and [MISC German  ] leadership ) , and distancing from the [LOC Spain  ] 's close relationship with the [LOC United States  ] that [ORG Aznar  ] fostered . 
End summary. --------------------- Mainstream Socialists --------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Founded more than 120 years ago , the [ORG PSOE  ] espouses as its main goals liberty , equality , solidarity and social justice . 
Communists broke with the [ORG Socialists  ] after the 1917 [MISC Russian  ] revolution and formed their own party ( now the [LOC United Left  ] , or [ORG IU  ] ) . 
[ORG PSOE  ] renounced any connection with [MISC Marxism  ] in 1979 , reaffirming the democratic and federal nature of the party . 
Since the end of the [MISC Franco  ] regime and the beginning of modern [MISC Spanish  ] democracy in 1977 , [ORG PSOE  ] has advocated comprehensive social programs , limited defense spending and a reduced role for the military in [MISC Spanish  ] life. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Socialists  ] governed [LOC Spain  ] with [PER Felipe Gonzalez  ] as President from 1982-1996 . 
Though the [ORG Socialists  ] lost power in 1996 amidst a swirl of corruption scandals , [PER Gonzalez  ] is credited with having strengthened the foundations of [MISC Spanish  ] democracy and governmental institutions during his time as head of government . 
[LOC Spain  ] joined the [ORG European Community  ] and , in a national referendum , reaffirmed its membership in [ORG NATO  ] under [PER Gonzalez  ] , a position [ORG PSOE  ] had originally opposed . 
[PER Gonzalez  ] called the latter a " triumph of the people of [LOC Spain  ] . 
" The Socialist government under [PER Gonzalez  ] also updated [LOC Spain  ] 's agreement with the [LOC United States  ] for [MISC American  ] use of [MISC Spanish  ] military bases. --------------- [PER Zapatero  ] 's [ORG PSOE  ] --------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) President-elect [PER Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero  ] took over as [ORG PSOE  ] 's secretary general in 2000 , narrowly edging out party " baron " [PER Jose Bono  ] . 
In 2003 the party issued a resolution outlining its political program designed " to increase freedom and the decision-making power of ordinary citizens over their own lives ; to reduce crime ; to allow citizens to develop their talents and abilities to the fullest ; and to ensure individuals are not abandoned to their own fate . 
" Following is a summary of [ORG PSOE  ] positions in major issue areas: -- Foreign Policy: See Ref A for a discussion of [ORG PSOE  ] 's likely foreign policy goals . 
[ORG PSOE  ] 's general foreign policy outlook was summarized well by [PER Manuel Marin  ] , the party 's international affairs spokesman in [MISC Congress:  ] " [ORG Aznar  ] wanted to make [LOC Spain  ] a great nation among the great nations , but [LOC Spain  ] lacks the means and capacity for that role . 
[LOC Spain  ] cannot be a determinative force in great international conflicts . 
We do not have the political or economic weight for that , nor the internal security and defense capabilities that would be necessary . 
" In general , we expect [ORG PSOE  ] to conduct more of its foreign policy via [LOC Brussels  ] and to hew closer to [MISC Franco-German  ] positions . 
[PER Zapatero  ] 's comments have also indicated he plans to distance [LOC Spain  ] from the close relations the [LOC U.S.  ] enjoyed under the [ORG Aznar  ] government . 
-- [ORG Economy:  ] The outlines of [ORG PSOE  ] 's economic platform are in Ref [PER C. Close  ] associates of [PER Zapatero  ] have been careful to say that the incoming [ORG PSOE  ] government will not make significant changes to the [ORG PP  ] 's successful economic policies . 
Some business leaders have voiced the same expectations with us . 
[ORG PSOE  ] will work to decrease unemployment ( currently over 11 percent and one of the highest in the [ORG EU  ] ) and convert jobs on temporary contracts ( currently one-third of new jobs created ) into permanent positions which carry full benefits . 
President-elect [PER Zapatero  ] has stated his government will focus significant attention on calming the rapid rise in housing prices and has already announced the creation of a [ORG Ministry of Housing  ] . 
The [ORG PSOE  ] also advocates more investment in [LOC R&D  ] and training for workers . 
They have promised to simplify the tax system , resulting in decreased taxes for many [MISC Spaniards  ] , while maintaining a balanced budget and fiscal discipline . 
-- [ORG Social Programs  ] and Issues: [ORG PSOE  ] has pledged to: include more health services in the nation 's health plan and reduce the maximum wait time for operations ; increase pensions and improve health care for the aged ; raise the minimum wage ; lengthen legally mandated paternity leave ; change the civil code to allow gay marriages ; mandate gender-based affirmative action for government jobs ; and devote more attention to the problem of domestic violence . 
-- Education: [PER Zapatero  ] has said [ORG PSOE  ] will lengthen the school day , increase bilingual education ( one-third of classes will be taught in [MISC English  ] ) , improve computer access , and increase grants for students who go on to higher education . 
-- Environment: We can anticipate more " green " environment policies . 
[ORG PSOE  ] officials have made clear they plan to scrap the [ORG PP  ] 's hugely controversial north-south water transfer plan , replacing it with a new water policy to be based on better water management , increased reliance on underground water supplies and greater investment in desalination . 
[ORG PSOE  ] has pledged [LOC Spain  ] 's complete compliance with the [ORG Kyoto Protocol  ] , despite rumblings from [MISC Spanish  ] industry that emissions cuts agreed under the [ORG EU  ] umbrella will severely and negatively affect competitiveness . 
[ORG PSOE  ] 's campaign platform called for a formal moratorium on nuclear power within five years , but recent pronouncements have indicated that the party might simply deny renewal of current licenses. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Zapatero  ] has not explained how he plans to pay for increased social programs while cutting taxes at the same time , except to suggest he may trim defense spending to pay part of the bill . 
His inner circle have suggested some revenues may come through greater government efficiencies , without specifying programs or jobs that would be eliminated. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG PSOE  ] is a mainstream [MISC European  ] socialist party . 
Although [PER Zapatero  ] has led [ORG PSOE  ] for four years , he has never held a government position , and since [ORG PSOE  ] has been out of power for eight years , neither have many of those around him ( see Ref B for a discussion those surrounding [PER Zapatero  ] ) . 
[ORG PSOE  ] and [PER Zapatero  ] will have a steep learning curve to climb upon taking power . 
Given the need to appeal to his large anti-war constituency , [PER Zapatero  ] will distance [MISC Spanish  ] foreign policy from [ORG Aznar  ] 's close relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] Nonetheless , we are hopeful that once [ORG PSOE  ] grasps that it has won and [PER Zapatero  ] is in office , [PER Zapatero  ] will come to realize that while he may have differences with the [LOC U.S.  ] , it is still in [LOC Spain  ] 's interest to cooperate with us on a number of issues .
