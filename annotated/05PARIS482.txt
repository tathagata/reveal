( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: During a January 24 lunch hosted by the Ambassador , top terrorism investigating judge [PER Jean-Louis Bruguiere  ] discussed a number of ongoing investigations he was leading and also commented on a variety of terrorism-related issues . 
He believed that 2005 would be a dangerous year , given the expertise demonstrated during terrorist attacks in 2004 , and thought in particular that [LOC Europe  ] and [LOC Asia  ] would be targeted . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Bruguiere  ] heads the [MISC Paris-based  ] section of investigating judges that focus on terrorism issues . 
He and fellow investigating judge [PER Jean-Francois Ricard  ] concentrate on international and [MISC Islamic  ] terrorism , while the other investigating judges examine [MISC Basque  ] , [MISC Corsican  ] and [MISC Breton-related  ] terrorism . 
[PER Bruguiere  ] is by far the most visible and media-savvy of the terrorism investigating judges . 
Just in the past month , he has been the subject of extensive profiles in [ORG Le Monde  ] , a [MISC French  ] center-left daily newspaper , and the [MISC Financial Times.  ] --------------------- INTERNATIONAL THREATS --------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Bruguiere  ] said he believed both [LOC Europe  ] and [LOC Asia  ] were front-line targets for terrorism in 2005 . 
One essential problem with the [ORG European Union  ] response , said [PER Bruguiere  ] , was that different countries had different institutional approaches to dealing with terrorist threats , despite the fact that many [ORG EU  ] states had open borders via the [LOC Schengen  ] agreement . 
He cited [LOC Germany  ] and the [LOC Netherlands  ] as two countries whose legal and administrative institutions made them difficult partners , despite their political will . 
[PER Bruguiere  ] speculated that those countries with direct experience of terrorism , such as the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC Spain  ] , [LOC France  ] and the [LOC U.K.  ] , had more fully developed their counter-terrorism capabilities . 
Potential terrorists knew which countries offered comparatively greater protections , and they took advantage of these opportunities within the [ORG EU  ] , said [ORG Bruguiere.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Al-Qaida-linked terrorists demonstrated their ability to strike within [LOC Europe  ] not only during the [LOC Madrid  ] bombings , but also during the 2004 [LOC Istanbul  ] bombings , said [PER Bruguiere  ] . 
He noted that [MISC British  ] financial and diplomatic institutions were targeted in [LOC Istanbul  ] at the exact time that President [PER Bush  ] was in the [LOC U.K.  ] [PER Bruguiere  ] also mentioned his ongoing concern with the [LOC Caucasus  ] and [LOC Chechnya  ] . 
He believes that al-Qaida terrorist [PER Abu Musab  ] al-Zarqawi has an extensive network in the region . 
The [LOC Caucasus  ] , said [PER Bruguiere  ] , are only " a three-hour flight to [LOC Paris  ] . 
" In order to combat this mosaic of threats , [PER Bruguiere  ] said [MISC European  ] countries needed to undertake two key actions: further sensitize their populations and strengthen the crackdown on informal financial networks , especially neighborhood storefronts and [MISC Pakistani-origin  ] hawalas. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Bruguiere  ] also cited [LOC Asia  ] as a particular area of concern . 
He and [PER Ricard  ] had discovered a [MISC Japan-based  ] network after arresting and interrogating [MISC French  ] citizen and longtime [MISC Japanese  ] resident [PER Lionel Dumont  ] . 
[PER Bruguiere  ] said he believed terrorism in [LOC Asia  ] would target financial centers . 
He was particularly concerned by the [MISC Pakistani-based  ] terrorist organization [ORG Lashkar-i-Tayyiba.  ] ----------------------- [ORG DOMESTIC  ] INVESTIGATIONS ----------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Bruguiere  ] and [PER Ricard  ] 's investigation into [MISC French  ] nationals going to fight in [LOC Iraq  ] ( reftel ) led to several arrests in the morning of January 24 , [PER Bruguiere  ] said ( additional reporting septel ) . 
He said their investigation had found juveniles as young as 13 trying to reach [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Their investigation had not revealed formal recruitment networks , said [PER Bruguiere  ] , but rather a number of autonomous attempts to go on jihad to [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The most common route for those trying to reach [LOC Iraq  ] was through [LOC Syria  ] and its many madrasas and other prayer centers . 
He noted that the conflict in [LOC Iraq  ] has emerged as a powerful recruitment tool for terrorism. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Responding to a question regarding false documents , [PER Bruguiere  ] said that the market for [MISC French  ] passports was quite strong , but that [MISC French  ] police were increasingly able to detect false papers when they came across them . 
Passports from [LOC Maghreb  ] countries were also in demand , said [PER Bruguiere  ] , because holders of such passports were given visa-free entry rights to [LOC Middle East  ] countries , especially [LOC Syria  ] . 
[PER Bruguiere  ] said he remained confident regarding the ongoing trial of [PER Djamel Beghal  ] and four of [PER Beghal  ] 's associates . 
( The " [PER Beghal  ] network " is accused of plotting to bomb the [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy in [LOC Paris  ] . 
) [PER Bruguiere  ] said he had heard from prosecutorial sources that [PER Beghal  ] 's defense was not going well. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Bruguiere  ] praised U.S.-French counter-terrorism cooperation , and said he looked forward to continuing the strong relationship his office had with USG interlocutors .
