END SUMMARY Germany: Why Has [MISC Our Money Not Been  ] Used on Our Projects ? --------------------------------------------- ------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG C/REL GERMANY  ] ) On February 3 , [MISC German  ] [LOC PermRep Brandenburg  ] demarched Ambassador [PER Daalder  ] regarding 50 million euros that [LOC Berlin  ] had donated to the [ORG Afghan National Army  ] ( [ORG ANA  ] ) [ORG Trust Fund  ] in October 2009 , handing over a non-paper reported in para 10 below . 
According to [LOC Brandenburg  ] , this money had been earmarked for use in several specific projects -- the [ORG ANS Logistics School  ] in [LOC Kabul  ] , an engineering school in [LOC Mazar-e-Sharif  ] , and an [ORG ANA Barracks  ] in [LOC Feyzabad  ] -- but so far no money had been disbursed for these projects . 
He argued , for example that construction of the logistics school had come to a halt . 
And Why Are You Charging Us an [ORG Administrative Fee  ] ? --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG C/REL GERMANY  ] ) [LOC Brandenburg  ] said that he had been instructed to raise this with us because of the unique role of the [LOC U.S.  ] , particularly the [ORG U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  ] , in this process . 
He said that there was a particular concern in [LOC Berlin  ] about a 15 percent administrative fee allegedly being charged by the [ORG U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  ] . 
At the same time , he acknowledged that [LOC Berlin  ] also had issues with how [ORG SHAPE  ] and the [ORG NATO Office of Resources  ] was handling the issue , adding that [LOC Germany  ] would also be raising this issue with [ORG NATO  ] officials . 
Creates Problems for Future Donations to the [ORG ANA Trust Fund  ] --------------------------------------------- -------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG C/REL GERMANY  ] ) [LOC Brandenburg  ] said that this was more than a technical budget and project management issue He said that several [MISC German  ] parliamentarians were asking questions about these funds . 
He said that the [MISC German  ] Government was in the process of preparing its 2010 budget and would like to be able to make an additional contribution to the [ORG ANA Trust Fund  ] , but that parliamentary questions and concerns about how the initial 50 million euro contribution was being handled could make this increasingly difficult . 
He added that -- since this was becoming “the talk of the town” in [LOC Kabul  ] -- it might also create difficulties in our ability to get other countries to contribute to the [ORG ANA Trust Fund.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG C/REL Germany  ] ) [ORG Brandenburg  ] said that this demarche would be delivered in [LOC Washington  ] , as well as other places . 
( Note: We understand it was also delivered to the [LOC Embassy Berlin  ] . 
) [MISC German  ] FM to Raise with [MISC SecGen  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG C/REL GERMANY  ] ) [LOC Brandenburg  ] said that since this money came from the [ORG MFA  ] , [MISC German  ] FM [MISC Westerwelle  ] had taken an interest in the issue and would likely raise this with [ORG NATO  ] USNATO 00000052 002 OF 003 Secretary General [PER Rasmussen  ] when he sees him at the [ORG Munich Security Conference  ] . 
[PER Daalder: Inaccuracies  ] , but Will Seek [LOC Washington Guidance  ] --------------------------------------------- ----------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG C/REL GERMANY  ] ) The Ambassador said that there appeared to be some factual inaccuracies in the [MISC German  ] demarche , but promised to forward it to [LOC Washington  ] with a request for a formal response . 
REQUEST FOR GUIDANCE -------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) RFG: We request [LOC Washington  ] guidance NLT Monday , February 8 , on how to respond to the [MISC German  ] demarche. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) COMMENT: As the Ambassador said to [LOC Brandenburg  ] , there do seem to be some inaccuracies in the [MISC German  ] demarche . 
At the same time , it is important we also recognize the serious political concerns the demarche raises . 
For example , while there may be good reasons for the 15 percent fee -- we understand it is a contingency fee not an administrative one -- the appearance that the [LOC U.S.  ] is charging Allies an excessive fee for the use of monies they have donated to the [ORG ANA Trust Fund  ] may be difficult to explain away during a parliamentary debate . 
[LOC Brandenburg  ] is probably correct in arguing that issues such as this could make it more difficult to encourage nations to donate to the [ORG Trust Fund  ] . 
Indeed , it took us months to even work out the agreements we needed to get the original [MISC German  ] donation to the [ORG Trust Fund  ] . 
We therefore urge [LOC Washington  ] to look into this issue from a political , as well as technical/financial , dimension and with as much transparency as possible . 
END COMMENT The Demarche Text ----------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG C/REL Germany  ] ) The text of the [MISC German  ] non-paper is reproduced in full below: BEGIN TEXT 3 February 2010 -- Refer to [ORG GER Agreement  ] dated October 1st with [ORG NATO  ] acting through its [ORG Office of Resources  ] by which [ORG GER  ] has committed to a voluntary contribution of [MISC Euros  ] 50 mio to the [ORG ANA Trust Fund  ] . 
Funds had been transferred to a [ORG SHAPE  ] account in late October 2009 . 
-- Note the agreement that the [ORG GER  ] contribution should be used exclusively for the aims set out in the [ORG ANA  ] TF [ORG Project Document  ] dated September 15th 2009 , among them three prioritised projects mentioned in [ORG Annex  ] 10 of the [ORG Project Document  ] ( 1 . 
[ORG ANS Logistic School Kabul  ] , to the amount of [MISC Euro 2  ] mio in 2009 ; 2 . 
[ORG Engineering School  ] in [LOC Mazar-e-Sharif  ] , to the amount of [MISC Euros  ] 4 mio in 2009 , 3 . 
[ORG ANA Barracks  ] in [LOC Feyzabad  ] , to the amount of [MISC Euro 1  ] mio. in 2009 ) . 
As of today , no project financing has occurred . 
-- Note that , at variance with the [MISC GER/IS  ] agreement and the overarching MoU between the [LOC US  ] , [ORG NATO  ] and [ORG SHAPE  ] on the “Management and [ORG Administration of Trust Fund Donations  ] for support and sustainment of the [LOC ANA”  ] , transfer of the [MISC German  ] [ORG ANA  ] TF contribution to an [LOC US  ] treasury account ( resulting in the prevalence of [LOC US  ] procurement procedures , including assignment of the [ORG US Army Corps of Engineers  ] and an administrative fee of 15 percent ) would be made without due consideration of the [MISC German  ] donation caveat , thereby hindering the early funding of the prioritised projects and thus the application of the [ORG German/IS Agreement  ] . 
-- Note that the issue has been raised already in the [MISC German  ] Parliament leading to questions why the [ORG Federal Government  ] had donated money without any tangible effect on the prioritised projects yet . 
Likewise , charging a 15 percent fee for managing and executing [ORG ANA  ] TF , especially when USNATO 00000052 003 OF 003 applied to the funding of projects pursued by [LOC Germany  ] , will inevitably attract heavy criticism by [MISC German  ] audit bodies and parliamentary commissions . 
-- Request partners , given construction delays that have already occurred and the urgency of respective funding requirements , to revert to the letter and spirit of the [ORG GER/IS Agreement  ] and make sure that funds earmarked for the prioritised projects totalling [MISC Euro 7  ] mio will be transferred without any further delay . 
As laid down in the [MISC GER/IS  ] agreement the earmarked funds ( with regard to the prioritised projects to the amount of [MISC Euro 7  ] mio , in particular with regard to the [ORG ANA Logistic School  ] , [LOC Kabul  ] , to the amount of [MISC Euro 2  ] mio. , as the financially most pressing case , since construction is already under way ) need to be re-allocated at the [LOC Kabul  ] level to the [ORG GER  ] Einsatzverwaltungsstelle ISAF in order to allow for a swift implementation of the prioritised projects . 
-- Urge partners to expedite the execution of funds donated by [ORG GER  ] to the [ORG ANA  ] TF aside from the prioritised projects and submit proofs of employment of funds in accordance with the US/NATO/SHAPE MoU as soon as possible . 
-- Express concern about the fact that any further delay in allocating funds to the prioritised [ORG GER  ] projects and executing the remainder of funds donated by [ORG GER  ] must substantially impair prospects for any further [MISC German  ] contributions to the [ORG ANA  ] TF .
