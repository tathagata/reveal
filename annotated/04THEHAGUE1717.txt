[ORG SECSTATE  ] 147536 Classified By: AMBASSADOR CLIFFORD [PER SOBEL  ] . 
REASONS: 1.4 ( B ) AND ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) SUMMARY: Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] met with [MISC Dutch  ] Foreign Minister [PER Ben Bot  ] on July 7 to preview the agenda for the July 12-13 General Affairs and [ORG External Relations Council  ] ( [ORG GAERC  ] ) in [LOC Brussels  ] . 
[PER Bot  ] anticipated that the [ORG GAERC  ] would agree to take positive steps with regard to [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Sudan  ] , although he expressed concern that the [ORG EU  ] was not receiving full credit for ongoing activities in [LOC Sudan  ] . 
In separate meetings with Finance Minister [PER Zalm  ] and at the [ORG MFA  ] , [ORG EB A/S  ] [PER Wayne  ] pressed for greater [ORG EU  ] engagement on [LOC Iraq  ] debt reduction and assistance . 
[PER Bot  ] said the [LOC China  ] Arms Embargo probably would be discussed at the September Gymnich , but made clear that holding a successful [MISC Chinese  ] summit is a top priority for the [MISC Dutch  ] Presidency . 
[LOC Burma  ] remains a ticklish issue for the [ORG EU  ] which puts the [ORG ASEM  ] summit at risk ; for other reasons , the [MISC EU-Canada  ] summit probably will not take place either . 
END SUMMARY . 
[LOC IRAQ  ] ---- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) According to [PER Bot  ] , agreeing on a plan for [ORG EU  ] support for [LOC Iraq  ] would be high on the [ORG GAERC  ] 's agenda . 
[MISC Iraqi  ] President [PER Allawi  ] , he said , had confirmed his intention to attend the session and would join the ministers for lunch . 
For security reasons , however , this information was not being circulated widely . 
( Note: We were subsequently told by a [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG MFA  ] contact that [PER Allawi  ] later decided not to attend the session . 
End Note ) . 
[PER Bot  ] stressed that the [ORG EU  ] sincerely wanted to be helpful to the new [MISC Iraqi  ] government and would look to [PER Allawi  ] for input in identifying critical needs . 
The [MISC Solana-Patten  ] letter of June 9 , 2004 , he added laid out general areas in which the [ORG EU  ] felt comfortable making contributions , i.e. supporting the political process ( including elections ) , promoting security and stability in [LOC Iraq  ] and the region , and engaging with [LOC Iraq  ] to lay the foundations for longer-term relations. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Bot  ] noted that he had recently had dinner with [ORG NATO  ] SYG [PER Jaap de  ] [PER Hoop Scheffer  ] and supported his efforts to involve [ORG NATO  ] in training and other activities inside [LOC Iraq  ] . 
It will be important , he noted , to ensure that [ORG NATO  ] and [ORG EU  ] efforts do not interfere with one another. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In separate meetings July 7 with Finance Minister [PER Gerrit Zalm  ] and [ORG MFA  ] Director General for Political Affairs [PER Hugo Siblesz  ] , visiting [ORG EB A/S  ] Tony [PER Wayne  ] pressed for greater [MISC Dutch  ] and [ORG EU  ] engagement on [LOC Iraq  ] debt reduction and assistance . 
A/S [PER Wayne  ] explained that the [ORG USG  ] planned to work through the [ORG Core Group  ] , which includes the [ORG EU  ] , to coordinate closely with the [ORG UN  ] on supporting political transition and economic reconstruction in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The [ORG USG  ] hoped for concrete actions by the year 's end . 
Additional [ORG USG  ] commitments would be based on [ORG IMF  ] sustainability analysis . 
A/S [PER Wayne  ] urged the [MISC Dutch  ] to use their role as [ORG EU  ] President to support [ORG EU  ] adoption of a similar pragmatic approach . 
While agreeing that such a non-political approach was best , [PER Zalm  ] said that additional bilateral [MISC Dutch  ] pledges , including debt reduction , would need to be drawn from the country 's development assistance funds , currently capped at 0.8 percent of GDP . 
Any additional funds directed toward [LOC Iraq  ] would mean a cut in assistance to currently funded programs in other countries with possibly greater needs . 
[PER Siblesz  ] said the [ORG EU  ] was clearly interested in hearing directly from [PER Allawi  ] ; his input on the situation on the ground in [LOC Iraq  ] could help to engage the [ORG EU  ] and reluctant [LOC Members States  ] ( i.e. , [LOC France  ] ) . 
[PER Siblesz  ] added that there would be a meeting this week of [MISC Member States  ] with assistance programs in [LOC Iraq  ] to examine how such programs could be expanded on an [MISC EU-basis  ] in such areas as police training , rule of law , and electoral support . 
[LOC CHINA  ] ARMS EMBARGO ------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] reiterated to [PER Bot  ] the strong [LOC U.S.  ] interest in avoiding a decision to lift the [LOC China  ] Arms Embargo . 
Noting that the issue was not on the agenda for the upcoming [ORG GAERC  ] , [PER Bot  ] said that it probably would be discussed at the September 13-14 Gymnich instead . 
As [ORG EU  ] president , the [MISC Dutch  ] were working to strengthen the code of conduct while encouraging [LOC China  ] to make progress on human rights . 
Personally , [PER Bot  ] said , he wished that the [MISC Dutch  ] had not inherited this difficult and emotional issue from the [MISC Irish  ] presidency , but they would have to deal with it one way or another . 
Lots of [ORG EU  ] member states , he added , were pushing to abolish the embargo , and as president the [MISC Dutch  ] had to remain objective . 
[PER Bot  ] made clear that his top priority was to ensure that a successful [MISC China-EU  ] summit occurred during the [MISC Dutch  ] presidency ; he was explicitly less concerned with what steps would be necessary to make this happen . 
[PER Bot  ] indicated that [LOC France  ] and [LOC China  ] were suggesting that the summit might be canceled unless action was taken on the embargo . 
Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] stressed that we did not want to be surprised in this area . 
[ORG ASEM  ] SUMMIT AND [LOC BURMA  ] --------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) Noting that [LOC Burma  ] was another ticklish issue for the [ORG EU  ] , [PER Bot  ] said that he hoped for a compromise that would allow the [MISC EU-ASEM  ] summit to go forward as planned . 
The [MISC Burmese  ] , he said , needed to make some sort of credible good-will gesture with regard to [LOC Aung Sang Suu Kyi  ] to move the process forward . 
The parliament and [ORG NGO  ] community in the [LOC Netherlands  ] was following this issue closely ; even though they were not as influential as in [LOC Britain  ] , he added , the [ORG GONL  ] still needed to take their concerns seriously . 
So far , the [ORG EU  ] had been unable to agree on a compromise solution for the [ORG ASEM  ] summit , such as agreeing to let [LOC Burma  ] participate in a lesser capacity . 
Having the [MISC Burmese  ] represented at the ministerial level , for example , would still be too high according to [PER Bot  ] . 
[PER Bot  ] said that he had discussed this issue with Secretary [PER Powell  ] in [LOC Istanbul  ] and had sought his support in [LOC SIPDIS  ] influencing [LOC Indonesia  ] and other [MISC Asian  ] countries to put pressure on [LOC Burma  ] to be more accommodating . 
[LOC SUDAN  ] ----- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Turning to [LOC Sudan  ] , [PER Bot  ] said that the [ORG EU  ] is already doing a lot with regard to the [LOC Darfur  ] crisis but does not get credit for it . 
Noting that the [MISC Dutch  ] have been pushing this issue within the [ORG EU  ] , [PER Bot  ] said the [ORG GAERC  ] would consider not only additional steps , but also how to publicize those measures the [ORG EU  ] is already taking . 
[PER Bot  ] noted that he had discussed this issue briefly with Secretary [PER Powell  ] in [LOC Istanbul  ] . 
[LOC CANADA  ] ------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Bot  ] noted with some exasperation that the [MISC EU-Canada  ] summit scheduled for the [ORG Dutch Presidency  ] probably would be postponed . 
The [MISC Canadian  ] Prime Minister , he said , was worried about his domestic political situation and had proposed impossible dates for the summit . 
Unless they could come up with better dates , [PER Bot  ] said , the summit would not take place . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) The [MISC Dutch  ] presidency has barely started , and already faces the possibility of three failed summits: [ORG ASEM  ] , [LOC Canada  ] , and [LOC China  ] . 
Of the three , the [MISC Chinese  ] is clearly the most important -- and the one by which the [MISC Dutch  ] presidency is most likely to be judged . 
[PER Bot  ] 's determination to hold a [MISC EU-China  ] summit at almost any cost , and his insistence that the [MISC Dutch  ] must remain objective on the Arms Embargo question reinforces the message we have heard elsewhere that the [MISC Dutch  ] will not take a leading or facilitating role in delaying a decision on lifting the arms embargo if the [MISC Chinese  ] ( and , [PER Bot  ] suggested , [LOC France  ] ) make it a precondition for a summit .
