( [ORG S  ] ) On November 20 , [MISC Saudi  ] Arabian Ambassador to the US [PER Adel al-Jubeir  ] invited the Charge d’Affaires and [ORG Executive Office Staff Assistant  ] ( note taker ) to his residence for lunch . 
During the meal , Ambassador al-Jubeir said that [MISC Pakistani  ] President [PER Pervez Musharraf  ] arrived in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , today , November 20 , and will meet with King [PER Abdullah  ] , Foreign Minister [PER Prince Saud  ] al-Faisal , and head of the General Intelligence Presidency [PER Prince Muqrin  ] bin [PER Abdulaziz  ] after he completes [ORG Umra  ] in [LOC Mecca  ] . 
He noted that [PER Musharraf  ] will meet with the Foreign Minister and [PER Prince Muqrin  ] first and thereafter see King [PER Abdullah  ] sometime in the evening. “The purpose of these meetings , ” said al-Jubeir , “is to get a readout of the situation and present our point of view to him.” <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Al-Jubeir  ] denied that [PER Musharraf  ] had come to the [LOC Kingdom  ] to meet with exiled former [MISC Pakistani  ] Prime Minister [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] , although he carefully avoided ruling out such a meeting . 
Instead , he boldly asserted that , “We in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] are not observers in [LOC Pakistan  ] , we are participants.” He asserted that the [MISC Saudi  ] government ( [ORG SAG  ] ) had offered [PER Sharif  ] a pledge of protection and asylum in the [LOC Kingdom  ] after his ouster by [PER Musharraf  ] in return for a promise that he would refrain from political activity for ten years . 
He added that [PER Sharif  ] had begun to attempt to test the limits of this promise five or six years in his exile. “Sharif broke his promise by conducting political activity while in the [LOC Kingdom  ] , ” al-Jubeir charged . 
He added that when the [ORG SAG  ] had permitted [PER Sharif  ] to travel to [LOC London  ] , he first promised the [MISC Saudis  ] not to engage in political activity or return to [LOC Pakistan  ] , but he then flew to [LOC Pakistan  ] from [LOC London  ] in a direct violation of his commitment. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Al-Jubeir  ] expressed considerable “disappointment” in [LOC Sharif’s  ] broken pledges to the [ORG SAG  ] . 
He stated very clearly that the [ORG SAG  ] has worked directly with [PER Musharraf  ] to have [PER Sharif  ] arrested on his return to [LOC Pakistan  ] and immediately deported to the [LOC Kingdom.  ] “We told [PER Musharraf  ] that we would receive him back and then keep him here as an ‘honored guest’ , ” al-Jubeir said . 
He added that [PER Prince Muqrin  ] had been the SAG’s point man in restraining [PER Sharif  ] . 
[PER Prince Muqrin  ] was allowed to reveal the terms of [LOC Sharif’s  ] asylum agreement , he noted . 
[PER Al-Jubeir  ] made it very clear that the [ORG SAG  ] would seek to control [LOC Sharif’s  ] movements in he future , even suggesting that he would be kept in a state only a little less severe than house arrest. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Al-Jubeir  ] added that he sees neither [PER Sharif  ] nor former Prime Minister [PER Benazir Bhutto  ] as a viable replacement for [PER Musharraf.  ] “With all his flaws , ” he said of [PER Musharraf  ] , “he is the only person that you or we have to work with now.” He claimed that [PER Sharif  ] would be unable to control the [MISC Pushtun-dominated Islamic  ] insurgency in the tribal region near [LOC Afghanistan  ] , while [PER Bhutto  ] would prove to be too divisive a figure to rule the country , which he characterized as “very tribal , much like our own country.” <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Al-Jubeir  ] added that for the [ORG SAG  ] , stability in [LOC Pakistan  ] is an essential strategic matter . 
Since [LOC Pakistan  ] possesses both nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles , from the [MISC Saudi  ] point of view , the policy choice to be made there boils down to a drastic choice: “We can either support [PER Musharraf  ] and stability , or we can allow bin [PER Laden  ] to get the bomb , “he told the [MISC Charge’.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Comment: As a senior royal advisor who has worked for King [PER Abdullah  ] for eight years now , al-Jubeir’s views generally track very closely with those of the King . 
It seems likely that King [PER Abdullah  ] , [PER Prince Muqrin  ] , and [PER Prince Saud  ] al-Faisal will offer [PER Musharraf  ] pledges of strong support in their meetings today . 
We note that the [MISC Saudis  ] have an economic hold on [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] , sine he was reportedly the first non-Saudi to receive a special economic development loan from the [ORG SAG  ] , with which to develop a business while here in exile . 
We will report further information on these meetings as it develops .
