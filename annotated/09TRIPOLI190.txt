REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The following [ORG Security Environment Profile Questionnaire  ] ( SEPQ ) - Spring 2009 is submitted by [ORG US Embassy Tripoli  ] via reftel format: 2 . 
( U ) POLITICAL VIOLENCE I . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) DEMONSTRATIONS: A. ARE THERE ANY ETHNIC OR RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES IN COUNTRY CAPABLE OF CARRYING OUT SIGNIFICANT [MISC ANTI-AMERICAN  ] DEMONSTRATIONS ? 
Yes , [PER Sunni Muslims  ] ( who are the vast majority in [LOC Libya  ] ) could be mobilized as occurred in the February 2006 demonstrations at the [MISC Italian  ] Consulate in [LOC Benghazi  ] in reaction to the [MISC Danish  ] cartoons controversy . 
[MISC Libyan  ] law criminalizes unauthorized demonstrations and only grants permission to demonstrations in line with revolutionary ideals . 
Although organized , these demonstrations can get out of hand. i . 
HAVE THERE BEEN [MISC ANTI-AMERICAN  ] DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE COUNTRY WITHIN THE LAST 12 MONTHS ? 
The Government of [LOC Libya  ] annually commemorates with small rallies of military personnel the June 11 , 1971 anniversary of the evacuation of all [LOC U.S.  ] personnel from the former [ORG Wheelus Air Force Base  ] and the official handover of the base to the [ORG GOL  ] . 
Previous [MISC Anti-American  ] demonstrations included: Unlike previous years , the April 2008 anniversary of the 1986 [LOC U.S.  ] bombing of [LOC Tripoli  ] and [LOC Benghazi  ] ( [ORG Operation El Dorado Canyon  ] ) was relatively low-key , marked only by a speech by [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi . 
On April 15 , 2007 the [ORG GOL  ] held large , but peaceful rallies in the main square of [LOC Tripoli  ] , the center of [LOC Benghazi  ] and the [PER Qadhafi  ] compound to commemorate the 21st anniversary of the 1986 [LOC U.S.  ] bombing of [LOC Tripoli  ] and [LOC Benghazi  ] ( [ORG Operation El Dorado Canyon  ] ) . 
The rallies were broadcast on [MISC Libyan  ] television and included speeches by government officials and footage of military and youth groups performing tactical demonstrations of rappelling down buildings and engaging in hand to hand combat . 
This anniversary is commemorated annually . 
The 20th anniversary in 2006 was commemorated with an April 15 concert held at the bombing site on [PER Qadhafi  ] 's [MISC Bab  ] al Azizia compound in [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
10/18/2005: [MISC Anti-American  ] demonstration at the [LOC Corinthia  ] [MISC Bab Africa Hotel  ] , then location of the [ORG US Embassy  ] . 
Approximately 100 demonstrators protested President [PER Bush  ] 's comments on October 17 , 2006 concerning the case of [MISC Bulgarian  ] medics accused of deliberately infecting [LOC Benghazi  ] children with the [MISC AIDS  ] virus . 
NOTE: On Sunday , May 18 , 2008 , Embassy [LOC Tripoli  ] ceased operations at the [LOC Corinthia  ] [MISC Bab Africa Hotel  ] . 
END NOTE Spring 2005: [MISC Anti-American  ] demonstration at the [ORG United Nations Tripoli Headquarters  ] . 
This demonstration was sponsored by the [ORG GOL  ] and was against [LOC U.S.  ] foreign policy in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
There were fewer than 500 protesters present and the event was peaceful and non-violent . 
There were no reported incidents. ii . 
HAVE DEMONSTRATIONS TAKEN PLACE NEAR OR IN FRONT OF [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC DIPLOMATIC FACILITIES  ] ? 
Yes , as noted in section i above. iii . 
WHAT IS THE AVERAGE SIZE OF AN [MISC ANTI-AMERICAN  ] DEMONSTRATION ? 
Most demonstrations are under 500 people and strictly controlled by the government , with the notable exception of the past years' April 15 demonstrations which numbered in the thousands across [LOC Libya  ] commemorating the 1986 air strikes by the [LOC United States  ] in response to the [MISC Libyan-backed  ] terrorist bombing of the [ORG Berlin LaBelle  ] nightclub , other demonstrations number fewer than five hundred people. iv . 
ARE [MISC ANTI-AMERICAN  ] DEMONSTRATIONS USUALLY TRIGGERED BY [LOC U.S.  ] FOREIGN POLICY INITIATIVES , MILITARY ACTIONS , OR BY DOMESTIC ISSUES ? 
[LOC U.S.  ] foreign policy initiatives are typically the catalyst for anti-American demonstrations . 
There have been demonstrations on the anniversary of military actions undertaken by the [LOC U.S.  ] against [LOC Libya  ] in 1986 . 
In the past , demonstrations appeared to focus on the [LOC U.S.  ] position on the [MISC Bulgarian  ] medic 's case , where [MISC Libyan  ] courts had imposed death sentences on several [MISC Bulgarian  ] nurses and one [MISC Palestinian  ] Doctor accused of having infected over 400 children with the [MISC HIV/AIDS  ] virus . 
The medics were subsequently released in July 2007. <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
ARE DEMONSTRATIONS GENERALLY VIOLENT OR PEACEFUL ? 
Demonstrations are generally peaceful , non-violent , and [MISC GOL-sponsored  ] . 
A February 2006 government-sponsored demonstration at the [MISC Italian  ] Consulate in [LOC Benghazi  ] , in response to the [MISC Danish  ] Cartoon controversy , turned tragically violent when security forces opened fire on a mob element that broke away from the main group and set fire to the building . 
Official reports claimed eleven casualties . 
Unofficial death toll numbers , which cannot be confirmed , were significantly higher . 
Follow-on violence damaged civil facilities in several [MISC Eastern Libyan  ] towns , including a police station. i . 
HAVE VIOLENT DEMONSTRATIONS RESULTED IN DAMAGE TO USG PROPERTY OR INJURIES TO USG EMPLOYEES ? 
No. ii . 
HAVE VIOLENT DEMONSTRATORS EVER PENETRATED OUR PERIMETER SECURITY LINE ? 
No. C. HAVE ANY ANTI-GOVERNMENT DEMONSTRATIONS TAKEN PLACE IN THE COUNTRY WITHIN THE LAST 12 MONTHS ? 
Demonstrations have been planned , but the [ORG GOL  ] has not allowed them to take place. i . 
HAVE ANY ANTI-GOVERNMENT DEMONSTRATIONS TAKEN PLACE NEAR OR IN FRONT OF [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC DIPLOMATIC FACILITIES  ] ? 
No. ii . 
WHAT IS THE AVERAGE SIZE OF AN ANTI-GOVERNMENT DEMONSTRATION ? 
The [ORG GOL  ] has not allowed anti-government demonstrations. iii . 
ARE DEMONSTRATIONS GENERALLY VIOLENT OR PEACEFUL ? 
The [ORG GOL  ] may at times use crowd-control , up to and including lethal force , to prevent demonstrations . 
Demonstrators are generally peaceful , but can include rock throwing. iv . 
HAVE ANY DEMONSTRATIONS RESULTED IN DAMAGE TO USG PROPERTY ? 
No demonstrations have resulted in damage to USG property . 
II . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) MACRO CONFLICT CONDITIONS: <a id='parA' href='#parA'>¶</a>A . 
IS THE HOST COUNTRY ENGAGED IN AN INTERSTATE OR INTRASTATE CONFLICT ? ( THIS MAY INCLUDE BATTLES BETWEEN ORGANIZED AND VIOLENT DRUG CARTELS ) . 
No. The [ORG GOL  ] is actively involved in trying to find a peaceful settlement in [LOC Darfur  ] and to prevent violence from spilling over to [LOC Chad  ] and The [LOC Central African Republic.  ] <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
IF AN INTRASTATE CONFLICT , IS IT AN INSURGENCY LIMITED TO A [ORG SPECIFIC REGION  ] OR IS IT A COUNTRYWIDE CIVIL WAR ? 
N/A C. IF LIMITED TO A [ORG SPECIFIC REGION  ] , ARE ANY [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC DIPLOMATIC FACILITIES  ] LOCATED IN THIS REGION ? 
N/A D. HAVE ANY OF THE FACTIONS INVOLVED IN INTRASTATE CONFLICTS SIGNALED OR DEMONSTRATED AN [MISC ANTI-AMERICAN  ] ORIENTATION ? 
No. III . 
( S/NF ) HOST COUNTRY CAPABILITIES A. ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES PROFESSIONAL AND WELL-TRAINED ? 
No. The [ORG US Embassy  ] has been instructed by the [ORG GOL  ] that all physical and personnel security arrangements will be coordinated through the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG External Security Organization  ] ( [MISC Libyan  ] Intelligence ) . 
The [ORG ESO  ] is responsible for all 83 foreign diplomatic facilities in [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
The [ORG RSO  ] has been unable to formally assess the host nation 's response capabilities . 
Through direct observation of [ORG GOL  ] assets deployed to the [LOC Corinthia  ] [MISC Bab Africa Hotel  ] , [ORG CMR Annex  ] , and the [ORG Villa compound Annex  ] in support of [ORG US Embassy  ] [LOC Tripoli  ] operations and visiting dignitaries , the [ORG RSO  ] has determined that the [MISC Libyan  ] government has a multi-agency response capability which appears to lack common doctrine , equipment , and training capability . 
On 02/01/2007 , [ORG ESO  ] officers interdicted two males observed taking pictures of the [ORG Villa Annex  ] . 
There was an altercation which the [ORG ESO  ] officers did not effectively and rapidly contain . 
The [ORG ESO  ] security detail stationed at the [ORG Villa Annex  ] routinely consists of two vehicles with two armed and two unarmed [ORG ESO  ] officers , and one marked traffic police vehicle with two armed officers. <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
HAVE THEY BEEN TRAINED BY [LOC U.S.  ] AGENCIES ? 
IF SO , PLEASE ELABORATE ON EFFECTIVENESS OF TRAINING . 
From 2005 through May 2008 the [ORG RSO  ] has provided limited security training to the [LOC Corinthia  ] [MISC Bab Africa Hotel  ] security staff , some of whom are [ORG ESO  ] officers , in support of [ORG US Embassy  ] physical security requirements . 
An [ORG ATA  ] assessment team traveled to post in March 2008 . 
[ORG ATA  ] is scheduled to provide 5 training courses to host government law enforcement and security starting March 2009 through September 2009 . 
The [ORG ATA  ] training in March 2009 may be postponed because of [LOC Libya  ] 's sensitivity to USG vetting requirements of its law enforcement and security personnel. <a id='parC' href='#parC'>¶</a>C . 
ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES CONFRONTED WITH SERIOUS , WIDESPREAD CORRUPTION INSIDE THEIR AGENCIES ? 
Yes . 
D. ARE THE [ORG INTELLIGENCE SERVICES  ] PROFESSIONAL AND CAPABLE OF DETERRING TERRORIST ACTIONS ? 
The [ORG ESO  ] is professional and capable in deterring terrorist actions . 
The Director of [ORG External Intelligence  ] has stated to various [ORG Mission  ] officials on separate occasions that he believes his service has a 95 per cent success rate in deterring acts of terrorism . 
However , in the wake of terrorist attacks over the past 12 months in [LOC Algeria  ] , [MISC Libyan  ] security officials have acknowledged their concerns about potential terrorist incursions across [LOC Libya  ] 's western borders and an increasing likelihood of terrorist attacks in [LOC Libya  ] . 
[MISC Libyan  ] Intelligence works effectively with other countries to counter terrorism . 
The Director of [ORG External Intelligence  ] advised the Charge in January 2007 that his service worked closely with the [MISC Tunisian  ] service to thwart a significant terrorist attack in [LOC Tunisia  ] . 
Their strength seems to be using intelligence to deter acts of terrorism . 
Their ability to counter an attack that has already begun is less apparent because of the lack of common doctrine , equipment , and training. <a id='parE' href='#parE'>¶</a>E . 
HAVE THE [ORG INTELLIGENCE SERVICES  ] BEEN COOPERATIVE WITH [LOC U.S.  ] EMBASSY REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION AND SUPPORT ? 
As pertains to intelligence sharing , yes . 
As pertains to security support and repeated requests for assistance , no . 
Dating back to February 2005 , the [ORG ESO  ] has not responded to [ORG RSO  ] requests to discuss a counter-assault response plan . 
The [ORG ESO  ] is the lead agency for the security of all foreign missions but limits post security officers to contact with one [ORG ESO  ] liaison individual . 
As a result , post 's security-related requests , made through the [ORG RSO  ] 's designated [ORG ESO  ] liaison , are often long delayed or appear to have been forgotten completely . 
[PER F. ASSUMING  ] THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT TERRORIST THREATS IN RECENT YEARS , HAVE HOST COUNTRY SECURITY SERVICES BEEN ABLE TO SCORE ANY [MISC MAJOR ANTI-TERRORISM  ] SUCCESSES ? 
Yes . 
In July 2007 , [MISC Libyan  ] security forces dismantled a network in eastern [LOC Libya  ] that was sending volunteer fighters to [LOC Algeria  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] and was plotting attacks against [MISC Libyan  ] security targets using stockpiled explosives . 
The operation resulted in the arrest of over 100 individuals . 
[PER G. HAS  ] HOST COUNTRY BEEN RESPONSIVE ( RE: TIMELINESS AND ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES ) TO EMBASSY REQUESTS FOR PROTECTIVE SECURITY ? 
AS of February 1 , 2009 , [ORG RSO  ] has been directed to coordinate all security related issues with the [ORG Office of International Relations and Cooperation for Public Security  ] . 
This new procedure and contact has expedited [ORG GOL  ] 's response to Embassy security-related issues . 
After numerous request through official channels over the past nine months for additional security personnel , the [ORG GOL  ] has assigned a QRF for the [ORG Villa Compound  ] and [ORG CMR Annex  ] . 
[PER H. HOW  ] DOES THE EMBASSY ASSESS THE OVERALL SECURITY AT MAJOR AIRPORTS IN THE COUNTRY ? ( EXCELLENT ; VERY GOOD ; GOOD/AVERAGE ; POOR ) Based on knowledge and experience , the [ORG RSO  ] would rate overall airport security as average . 
[PER I. HOW  ] EFFECTIVE ARE CUSTOMS AND IMMIGRATION CONTROLS AGENCIES ? ( EFFECTIVE ; AVERAGE ; INEFFECTIVE ) Based on knowledge and experience , the [ORG RSO  ] would rate the Customs and [ORG Immigration Control  ] agencies as below average . 
Officials do appear to effectively utilize a computerized lookout system for arrivals and departure control at [ORG Tripoli International Airport  ] . 
With respect to land borders , the major issues lie in the [LOC South  ] , where controls are thought to be ineffective . 
USG-sponsored [ORG ATA  ] and [ORG EXBS  ] training missions planned for FY09 will provide [ORG RSO  ] with a more complete picture of host government capacities . 
[PER J. HOW  ] EFFECTIVE ARE BORDER PATROL FORCES ? ( EFFECTIVE ; AVERAGE ; INEFFECTIVE ) Ineffective . 
The [ORG ESO  ] has in the past advised [ORG US Embassy  ] management that they believe this is a vulnerable area and one which they readily admit they cannot control . 
[LOC Libya  ] also has a significant problem in dealing with illegal migration along its [MISC Southern  ] border . 
3 . 
( U ) INDIGENOUS TERRORISM I . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC ANTI-AMERICAN  ] TERRORIST GROUPS: A. ARE THERE INDIGENOUS , [MISC ANTI-AMERICAN  ] TERRORIST GROUPS IN COUNTRY ? 
Yes . 
B. IF YES , HOW MANY ? 
PLEASE NAME GROUPS . 
[ORG AL'JAMA'A AL ISLAMIYA AL-MUQATALA  ] ( [MISC Libyan  ] [MISC Islamic Fighting  ] Group/LIFG ) . 
In November 2007 , the [ORG LIFG  ] officially announced that they had merged with [ORG Al-Qa'ida  ] in the Lands of the [MISC Islamic  ] [ORG Maghreb  ] ( [ORG AQIM  ] ) . 
It is not known whether there are currently active operational [ORG LIFG  ] or [ORG Al-Qa'ida  ] cells in [LOC Libya  ] . 
The presence in [LOC Libya  ] of [MISC Libyans  ] who fought in the [LOC Iraq  ] jihad and returned to [LOC Libya  ] may increase the threat against [LOC U.S.  ] interests and personnel in [LOC Libya  ] . 
[ORG AQIM  ] has been active and successful in recruiting [MISC Libyan  ] extremists , many of a young age , to join the ranks of the [ORG AQIM  ] and then undergo terrorist training in neighboring [LOC Algeria  ] . 
C. HAVE GROUPS CARRIED OUT LETHAL [MISC ANTI-AMERICAN  ] ATTACKS WITHIN THE LAST 12 MONTHS ? 
No. D. WERE THERE ANY OTHER [MISC ANTI-AMERICAN  ] ATTACKS ? 
No. E. HAVE GROUPS ATTACKED [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG DIPLOMATIC  ] TARGETS ? 
No. [PER F. HAVE  ] GROUPS ATTACKED [LOC U.S.  ] BUSINESS , [LOC U.S.  ] MILITARY , OR U.S.- RELATED TARGETS ? 
No. [PER G. HAVE  ] GROUPS LIMITED THEIR ATTACKS TO SPECIFIC REGIONS OR DO THEY OPERATE COUNTRY-WIDE ? 
No , they operate country-wide , though mostly in [MISC Eastern  ] regions. <a id='parH' href='#parH'>¶</a>H . 
IF ATTACKS ARE LIMITED TO REGIONS , ARE THERE ANY U.S.DIPLOMATIC FACILITIES LOCATED IN THESE REGIONS ? 
No. II . 
( SBU ) OTHER INDIGENOUS TERRORIST GROUPS: A. ARE THERE OTHER INDIGENOUS TERRORIST GROUPS ( NOT [MISC ANTI-AMERICAN  ] ) IN COUNTRY ? 
No. <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
IF YES , HOW MANY ? 
PLEASE NAME GROUPS . 
N/A C. HAVE GROUPS CARRIED OUT ATTACKS IN THE CAPITAL OR IN AREAS WHERE [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG DIPLOMATIC  ] FACILITIES ARE LOCATED ? 
No. <a id='parD' href='#parD'>¶</a>D . 
WERE ATTACKS LETHAL AND/OR INDISCRIMINATE ? 
No. <a id='parE' href='#parE'>¶</a>E . 
HAVE THERE BEEN ANY AMERICANS KILLED OR INJURED IN THESE ATTACKS ? 
No. 4 . 
( U ) TRANSNATIONAL TERRORISM I . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) TRANSNATIONAL TERRORIST INDICATORS: A. ARE THERE ANY FOREIGN TERRORIST GROUPS THAT HAVE A PRESENCE IN COUNTRY ? 
PLEASE PROVIDE NAMES . 
In 2005 , [LOC Libya  ] provided assurances to the [ORG USG  ] reiterating its renunciation of the use of state-sponsored terrorism as a political adjunct . 
There may be dormant individuals affiliated with [MISC Palestinian  ] rejectionist groups such as the [ORG PFLP-GC  ] and the [ORG ANO  ] domiciled in [LOC Libya  ] . 
There are [ORG Al-Qa'ida  ] in the Land of the [MISC Islamic  ] [ORG Magreb  ] ( [ORG AQIM  ] ) members and [MISC Libyans  ] who fought in the [LOC Iraq  ] jihad present in [LOC Libya.  ] <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
HOW DOES POST ASSESS THIS PRESENCE ? 
IS IT AN OPERATIONAL CELL ? 
[ORG FINANCIAL CELL  ] ? 
SUPPORT CELL ? 
[ORG PROPAGANDA CELL  ] ? 
[MISC Palestinian  ] rejectionist group members are residual settled members from the time of [LOC Libya  ] 's support to these groups . 
They are not operationally active . 
[ORG AQIM  ] has been active and successful in recruiting [MISC Libyan  ] extremists , many of a young age , to join the ranks of the [ORG AQIM  ] and then undergo terrorist training in neighboring [LOC Algeria.  ] <a id='parC' href='#parC'>¶</a>C . 
IS THE HOST GOVERNMENT SYMPATHETIC TO THESE GROUPS ? 
Generally speaking , no . 
However , undoubtedly , there are factions within the [MISC Libyan  ] government opposed to the reestablishment of relations between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Libya  ] who may be sympathetic to [MISC Palestinian  ] rejectionist groups , but not sympathetic to [ORG Al-Qa'ida  ] in the [ORG Maghreb  ] ( [ORG AQIM  ] ) or the [MISC Libyan Islamic Fighting Group  ] ( [ORG LIFG  ] ) . 
The [ORG GOL  ] has arrested [ORG Al-Qa'ida  ] members in the past year and reiterated its renunciation of terrorism . 
The [ORG GOL  ] views extremists operating under a religious banner as a serious potential threat to the regime and have demonstrated resolve against [ORG Al-Qa'ida  ] and its surrogates. <a id='parD' href='#parD'>¶</a>D . 
ARE THERE SUSPECT NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS ( [ORG NGOS  ] ) IN THE COUNTRY THAT HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH ANY OF THESE GROUPS ? 
No , The [ORG GOL  ] does not allow independent [ORG NGOs  ] . 
It is not likely that support for such groups exist. <a id='parE' href='#parE'>¶</a>E . 
ARE THERE ANY ETHNIC OR RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES IN COUNTRY THAT ARE SYMPATHETIC TO THESE GROUPS ? 
The [ORG ESO  ] has indicated to post officers that they have infiltrated several religious communities ( mosques ) in an attempt to extinguish any anti-government sentiment . 
The general trend in the region has also seen migration of hard core believers to [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Recent indications suggest a shift to [ORG AQIM  ] in [LOC Sahelian Africa  ] . 
[MISC Iraqi  ] [ORG Sunni  ] groups have surfaced over the last year that appear to be in a dialogue with the [ORG Libyan Revolutionary Committees Organization  ] ( [ORG REVCOM  ] ) and other senior regime elements , dialogue that would have required the support of the [MISC Libyan  ] leadership to occur . 
The nature of this dialogue is unclear. <a id='parF' href='#parF'>¶</a>F . 
HOW DOES POST ASSESS THE LEVEL , [LOC INTENT  ] , AND SCOPE OF HOSTILE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES ( [LOC IRAN  ] , [LOC IRAQ  ] , [LOC SYRIA  ] , [LOC SERBIA  ] , [LOC SUDAN  ] , [LOC ET.AL  ] . 
) IN COUNTRY RELATIVE TO POTENTIAL ANTI-AMERICAN TERRORIST ACTS ? 
Post does not have the capability to fully assess the type of presence , if any , of any such groups and unable to provide a measurable response to this question , based on its present capabilities to determine this particular threat . 
These particular groups are not well-positioned to penetrate the mission . 
Post adds that there is a [MISC Russian  ] and [MISC Chinese  ] presence in-country , who are active in the community . 
[MISC Iranian  ] and [MISC Sudanese  ] intelligence services are present in [LOC Libya  ] . 
They are not well positioned to perpetuate attacks against the [LOC U.S.  ] presence . 
The host government is well-known for its past acts of anti-American terrorism , but following its renunciation of terrorism and subsequent removal from the state sponsors list , the present aggressive posture of its intelligence agencies toward the [LOC US  ] presence seems to be focused on information gathering. <a id='parG' href='#parG'>¶</a>G . 
HOW DOES POST ASSESS THE AVAILABILITY OF WEAPONS AND EXPLOSIVES IN COUNTRY OR FROM NEARBY COUNTRIES FOR HOSTILE TERRORIST ELEMENTS ? 
[LOC Libya  ] has terminated its weapons of mass destruction program and [LOC U.S.  ] scientific observers are monitoring the progress of other [MISC Libyan  ] programs , such as their chemical , biological and ballistic weapons programs . 
Small arms and ammunition are typically difficult to obtain in [LOC Libya  ] . 
One area of concern , however , is in the [LOC East  ] , in the desert battlefields of [LOC WWII  ] , where the indigenous population searches for buried ordinance for cooking and fishing purposes . 
Vast minefields on the [MISC Southern  ] and [MISC Eastern  ] borders are thought to be culled by smugglers who sell the explosives to rebel groups in the [LOC Sahel  ] region . 
Jihadist cells that have been disrupted have also used this as a source of explosives . 
The [ORG GOL  ] has difficulty controlling its southern border . 
As a result there is a problem with the smuggling of weapons and drugs .
