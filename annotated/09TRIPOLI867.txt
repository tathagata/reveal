REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] According to the xxxxxxxxxxxx of [ORG PetroCanada  ] , xxxxxxxxxxxx the [MISC Libyan  ] government demanded [ORG PetroCanada  ] cut its oil production due to misunderstandings between [LOC Libya  ] and [LOC Canada  ] over [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] 's aborted trip to [LOC Canada  ] in late September. xxxxxxxxxxxx believes that PM-equivalent al-Baghdad al-Mahmoudi was " calling all the shots " in the ongoing dispute , and [MISC Canadian  ] diplomats are hopeful that their Foreign Minister 's October 19 meeting with al-Mahmoudi may have laid the groundwork for a solution . 
The effects of the dispute continue to reverberate throughout [LOC Libya  ] , with [ORG PetroCanada  ] conducting contingency planning to evacuate its staff , other [MISC Canadian  ] citizens fearing expulsion , and still others experiencing visa difficulties . 
In the past few days , [MISC Canadian  ] citizens on a cruise ship were not allowed to disembark in [LOC Tripoli  ] , while the other passengers ( mainly [MISC Europeans  ] ) were permitted to leave the ship for the day . 
Separately , [LOC U.S.  ] company Marathon may be benefiting from [ORG PetroCanada  ] 's woes , as it has been instructed to increase production to make up for [ORG PetroCanada  ] 's shortfall . 
End summary . 
FROM THE HORSE'S MOUTH: [ORG PETROCANADA  ] GM DETAILS RECENT ORDEAL <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) xxxxxxxxxxxx of [ORG PetroCanada  ] , shared with [MISC Econoff  ] his company 's recent ordeal in [LOC Libya  ] that began with a threat of nationalization , but which was pared down to an order by the [ORG National Oil Corporation  ] ( [ORG NOC  ] ) to cut production by 50 percent . 
He said [ORG PetroCanada  ] and [ORG Hrouj  ] , its NOC-owned partner , had actually surpassed production quotas for the past six months but the [ORG NOC  ] had never asked them to cut back . 
Although the [ORG NOC  ] never gave [ORG PetroCanada  ] a clear reason for the production cuts ( and may simply have been passing down an order from PM-equivalent al-Mahmoudi ) , xxxxxxxxxxxx believed they were linked to the diplomatic row surrounding [MISC Libyan  ] Leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] 's aborted trip to [LOC Canada.  ] xxxxxxxxxxxx noted that press reports had " spun out of control , " alleging that the [MISC Canadian  ] FM had planned to see al-Qadhafi on his stop-over in [LOC Newfoundland  ] to complain about [LOC Lockerbie  ] bomber [PER Abdel Basset  ] al-Megrahi 's " hero 's welcome . 
" A [MISC Canadian  ] engineer working for [ORG Hrouj  ] separately told us he had heard the row stemmed from the issuance of a tourist visa for al-Qadhafi , rather than a diplomatic visa as Head of [LOC State.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) xxxxxxxxxxxx said the [MISC Canadian  ] company was suddenly threatened with nationalization during the week of September 27 which was then pared down to the required decrease in production. xxxxxxxxxxxx said he had received phone-calls from the [ORG NOC  ] " every 15 minutes " with new instructions . 
By the end of the week , xxxxxxxxxxxx said he was ready to tell the [ORG NOC  ] to " do whatever you want with us . 
" He believed the Secretary of the General People 's Committee ( PM-equivalent ) al-Baghdad al-Mahmoudi was " calling all the shots , " particularly in his role as head of the newly-created [ORG Supreme Council for Energy Affairs  ] , now that [PER Shokri Ghanem  ] had resigned from his position as Chair of the [ORG NOC.  ] xxxxxxxxxxxx praised the efforts of [LOC Canada  ] 's new Ambassador to [LOC Libya  ] to help resolve [ORG PetroCanada  ] 's problems and noted that her gender had played to her advantage , opining that the [MISC Libyans  ] would have been " much tougher on a man . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) xxxxxxxxxxxx confirmed that [ORG PetroCanada  ] had prepared contingency plans for repatriating its [MISC Canadian  ] staff following reports that the [MISC Libyan  ] authorities were planning to " raid " [ORG PetroCanada  ] 's offices . 
He noted that before the recent crisis , the company had actually begun a process of regularizing the visa status of its expatriate employees about six weeks ago , by providing the [ORG Immigration Office  ] with a list of staff who needed to convert their visas from business visas to resident visas . 
( Note: It is a common practice for foreign firms to bring in long-term staff on multiple-entry business visas as they are easier to procure , and do not require exit visas for vacations and other trips outside [LOC Libya  ] . 
These visas are not meant to be used by long-term residents . 
End note ) . 
He intimated that [ORG PetroCanada  ] perhaps should not have been so forthcoming with their list of expatriate staff with technically irregular visa statuses , and that their efforts to " come clean " had only caused them more trouble. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Of [ORG PetroCanada  ] 's 232 employees in [LOC Libya  ] , around 100 are expatriates , mainly from [LOC Canada  ] , the [LOC UK  ] , and the [LOC U.S.  ] xxxxxxxxxxxx commented that even before this episode , the company had planned to decrease the number of expatriate staff due to the high costs [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000867 002.2 OF 003 involved of bringing employees and their families to [LOC Libya  ] , and that the firm would vacate at least 56 houses in [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
A [MISC British  ] employee of [ORG PetroCanada  ] complained that , although the company 's management continued to hold regular meetings to update [MISC Canadian  ] staff on the situation , other expat employees have been left in the dark. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In spite of the current dispute , xxxxxxxxxxxx said [ORG PetroCanada  ] still planned to continue with its plans to drill 49 new wells starting in the first quarter of 2010 . 
[ORG PetroCanada  ] has also detailed 50 of its staff to work in [ORG Hrouj  ] in order to provide on-the-job training and share new technologies such as enhanced oil recovery ( [ORG EOR  ] ) and improved oil recovery ( [ORG IOR  ] ) . 
This has had mixed results. xxxxxxxxxxxx was skeptical whether the [MISC Libyans  ] really wanted their advice , and in particular , the [MISC Libyan  ] middle managers of NOC-owned companies projected the attitude that [LOC Libya  ] had continued to produce oil during the embargo " just fine " and if need be , could do it again . 
OTHER [MISC CANADIAN  ] CITIZENS ON EDGE <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The recent diplomatic spat between [LOC Libya  ] and [LOC Canada  ] has had a ripple effect on [MISC Canadians  ] working in other companies who are afraid of being deported . 
According to the [MISC Canadian  ] Commercial Counselor , there are 1,000 [MISC Canadians  ] living in [LOC Libya  ] ( not counting dual national [MISC Libyan/Canadians  ] ) . 
Many of them have been calling the [MISC Canadian  ] Embassy asking whether they will be deported or whether they will be not allowed to enter [LOC Libya  ] if they leave . 
Even long-time residents of [LOC Libya  ] are worried . 
The [MISC Canadian  ] principal of the [ORG International Martyr 's School  ] sent out a text message to [MISC Canadian  ] staff warning of possible deportations . 
( Note: This school , formerly the [ORG American Oil Company School  ] , was taken over by the [MISC Libyans  ] after the [LOC U.S.  ] sanctions were imposed . 
End note ) . 
One [MISC Swiss-Canadian  ] teacher ( a 15-year [LOC Tripoli  ] resident ) , who received the text message , said she was especially concerned as she had thought her [MISC Canadian  ] passport had provided more protection of late than her [MISC Swiss  ] one . 
The heads of several [LOC U.S.  ] oil companies have expressed concern that their [MISC Canadian  ] employees are having trouble receiving or renewing their visas . 
According to xxxxxxxxxxxx , press reports that [LOC Libya  ] is no longer no issuing visas to [MISC Canadians  ] appear to be due to the recent visit of a cruise-ship to [LOC Libya  ] that had [MISC European  ] and [MISC Canadian  ] tourists onboard . 
All tourists except the [MISC Canadian  ] tourists were allowed to disembark for their day-trip in [LOC Tripoli.  ] xxxxxxxxxxxx believes this incident was picked up by [MISC Canadian  ] press . 
PETROCANADA'S CUTS MAY HELP OTHER PRODUCERS <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) xxxxxxxxxxxx said he saw the [ORG PetroCanada  ] cuts as a positive development for [LOC Marathon  ] and the [ORG Waha Group  ] ( comprised of the [ORG NOC  ] , [LOC Marathon  ] , [ORG Amerada Hess  ] , and [ORG ConocoPhillips  ] ) . 
He said the [ORG NOC  ] had encouraged [ORG Waha  ] to " produce unrestricted " amounts of oil during an annual meeting last week , and he heard other oil companies were told to do the same . 
( Note: This is a contradiction of statements by Acting [ORG NOC  ] Chair [PER Ali Sugheir  ] that even two NOC-owned companies were ordered to cut production according to [ORG OPEC  ] quotas ; see Ref [PER C. End  ] note ) However , he heard the [MISC German  ] company [ORG Wintershall  ] was told to cut back by 15,000 b/d from its production of 90,000 b/d , an apparent effort by the [ORG NOC  ] to try to break through the impasse in renegotiating [ORG Wintershall  ] 's agreement with the [ORG NOC  ] . 
In his view , the [MISC Libyans  ] are trying to make up for the shortfall from [ORG PetroCanada  ] and [ORG Wintershall  ] and at the same time , assess the true production capacity of all oil producers in [LOC Libya  ] . 
He said [ORG PetroCanada  ] had publicly stated their cuts were due to OPEC-mandated restrictions , but that no one in [LOC Tripoli  ] believed this . 
[MISC CANADIAN  ] FOREIGN MINISTER VISITS [LOC TRIPOLI  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) According to the newly-arrived [MISC Canadian  ] Commercial Counselor , a solution to the recent quarrels between [LOC Libya  ] and [LOC Canada  ] is in sight after the October 19-20 visit of FM [PER Lawrence Cannon  ] . 
He noted the FM had met with the " source of the problem , " al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi . 
The [MISC Canadian  ] Ambassador told us that the meeting with al-Mahmoudi had been " tough " and that it had only gone part-way to resolving the problem . 
The [MISC Libyans  ] had requested that the [MISC Canadians  ] prepare a report on the circumstances surrounding [PER Qadhafi  ] 's aborted trip to [LOC Canada  ] ; in exchange for the report , the [MISC Libyans  ] would address [ORG PetroCanada  ] 's [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000867 003.2 OF 003 problems . 
The [MISC Canadian  ] Commercial Counselor believes PM-equivalent al-Baghdadi was using the [ORG PetroCanada  ] incident to bolster his own position , now that he heads the [ORG Supreme Council for Energy  ] , and has gotten rid of [LOC Shokri Ghanem.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Comment: [LOC Libya  ] 's moves against [ORG PetroCanada  ] , set against the backdrop of an escalating conflict with [LOC Switzerland  ] , have left the expatriate business community on edge . 
[LOC Libya  ] 's willingness to explicitly link commercial contracts to political disputes has only added to the international energy companies' growing frustration with the [MISC Libyan  ] business climate . 
Although most oil industry insiders do not believe the [MISC Canadian  ] saga will escalate to the extent of the [MISC Swiss-Libya  ] standoff , it is unclear how this dispute ultimately will be resolved .
