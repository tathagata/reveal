( C ) [MISC Summary: Recent  ] media reports suggest that [LOC Rome  ] may be close to finalizing an agreement to compensate [LOC Libya  ] for damages incurred during [LOC Italy  ] 's colonization of the country ; however , [LOC Italy  ] 's ambassador to [LOC Tripoli  ] expressed doubt that such would occur soon . 
Pointing to the [ORG GOL  ] 's demands for compensation and its reluctance to consider [LOC Italy  ] 's requests for revised commercial/travel policies and resolution of sanctions-era debts to [MISC Italian  ] companies , he criticized [LOC Libya  ] for failing to adopt policies that would encourage the greater trade ties and foreign investment it claims to seek . 
In his view , [PER Qadhafi  ] and the [ORG GOL  ] 's senior leadership lack real strategic vision and instead do themselves a disservice by insisting on tactical linkages between " concessions " and " compensation " . 
End summary . 
2 . 
( C ) Open-source media reported October 29 remarks by [MISC Italian  ] Foreign Minister [PER Massimo D'Alema  ] to the effect that [LOC Italy  ] and [LOC Libya  ] may be close to signing an agreement designed to settle the longstanding question of compensation for damages sustained by [LOC Libya  ] during [LOC Italy  ] 's colonization of the country . 
[LOC Tripoli  ] 's rumor mill has been rife with speculation that movement towards an agreement , which has been under discussion for some time , was a [MISC Libyan  ] pre-condition for granting [LOC Italy  ] 's [ORG Eni  ] an ostensibly lucrative oil/gas exploration and production sharing agreement . 
( Note: Ref A reports on the deal , trumpeted by [ORG Eni  ] as a success , and explains that drawbacks in details of the arrangement may have serious repercussions for other foreign oil and gas concession holders operating in [LOC Libya  ] . 
End note . 
) 3 . 
( C ) In a conversation with P/E Chief November 4 , [LOC Italy  ] 's Ambassador to [LOC Tripoli  ] , [PER Francesco Trupiano  ] , dismissed the idea of a linkage between [ORG Eni  ] 's deal and the recent resurgence of interest in a colonial compensation agreement . 
Noting that [MISC Italian  ] commercial interests were pressuring [LOC Rome  ] to accommodate [LOC Libya  ] 's desire for symbolic remuneration , he offered that the agreement was further fueling what he described as the [ORG GOL  ] 's " inherently corsair mentality " . 
In return for signing an agreement designed to bring the contentious issue of colonial-era abuses to a close , [LOC Libya  ] has insisted that it is " owed " a highway that former [MISC Italian  ] prime minister [PER Silvio Berlusconi  ] pledged to finance during a 2004 visit to [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
The 1,900 kilometer highway , to be built to [MISC European  ] standards , is to span [LOC Libya  ] 's coastline from the [LOC Tunisia-Libya  ] border in the west to the [MISC Libya-Egypt  ] border in the east . 
4 . 
( C ) [PER Trupiano  ] said that some in the [MISC Italian  ] government hope that [ORG Eni  ] 's deal will lend impetus to efforts to conclude a colonial compensation treaty to help facilitate trade , but cautioned that the [ORG GOL  ] has balked at agreeing to [LOC Italy  ] 's three conditions . 
The first is facilitating easier registration of [MISC Italian  ] companies by removing the requirement that the [MISC Libyan  ] Prime Minister provide " political " approval to [MISC Italian  ] entities seeking to do business in [LOC Libya  ] in addition to the commercial approval that must be obtained from the Minister for [ORG Economy  ] and Trade . 
Companies from other countries only have to obtain approval from the Minister of [ORG Economy  ] ; the requirement for political approval applies only to [MISC Italian  ] firms . 
The second condition is revoking [MISC Libyan  ] legislation that prohibits [MISC Italian  ] " [MISC Fourth Shore  ] " immigrants who resided in [LOC Cyrenaica  ] and [LOC Tripolitania  ] , and who were expelled in the early 1970 's , from visiting [LOC Libya  ] . 
[PER Trupiano  ] noted that some of those individuals had family ties that stretched back three generations or more by the time they were expelled from [LOC Libya  ] and said the [MISC Italian  ] government has received " numerous " requests for assistance in recent years from elderly [MISC Fourth Shore  ] immigrants who were born in [LOC Libya  ] and hope to visit again before they pass away . 
[LOC Italy  ] 's final stipulation for a colonial compensation treaty is resolving the issue of some 647 million [MISC Euros  ] worth of payment for products and services owed to [MISC Italian  ] companies by the [ORG GOL  ] performed in the late 1980 's and early 1990 's in the early sanctions period . 
5 . 
( C ) Noting that the [ORG GOL  ] and even the affected [MISC Italian  ] companies were willing to demonstrate " considerable flexibility " on the issue of unpaid bills , [PER Trupiano  ] complained that the [ORG GOL  ] [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000949 002 OF 002 has balked at lifting the political approval requirement for [MISC Italian  ] companies and , more annoyingly , facilitating travel for " [MISC Fourth Shore  ] " immigrants . 
On the latter , the [ORG GOL  ] has proposed reviewing cases on a case-by-case basis , an arrangement [PER Trupiano  ] likened to an outright refusal in light of [LOC Libya  ] 's notoriously difficult visa practices . 
[PER Trupiano  ] attributed the [ORG GOL  ] 's " haughtiness " to soaring oil prices , its successful candidacy for a [ORG UNSC  ] non-permanent seat and recent successes such as the slew of [MISC French-Libyan  ] commercial agreements brokered during President [PER Sarkozy  ] 's visit in connection with efforts to secure the release of [MISC Bulgarian  ] medics accused of deliberately infecting [LOC Benghazi  ] children with the [MISC AIDS  ] virus ( ref B and previous ) . 
The [ORG GOL  ] complains that more [MISC European  ] companies have not rushed to enter the [MISC Libyan  ] market , he said , but consistently fails to take decisions that would facilitate greater commercial interest , let alone strike a grace note such as facilitating travel for [MISC Fourth Shore  ] immigrants . 
He expressed pessimism about the possibility that an [MISC Italian-Libyan  ] colonial compensation treaty would be finalized soon . 
6 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Trupiano  ] 's frustration with the [ORG GOL  ] 's unwillingness to adopt policies that would invite the greater commercial interest and foreign investment it claims to seek is consistent with Post 's observations . 
The [ORG GOL  ] consistently expresses disappointment that more [LOC U.S.  ] companies are not participating in [LOC Libya  ] 's current development efforts , but has been either unwilling or unable to make practical decisions on visa issuances or contract language that would help encourage greater [LOC U.S.  ] commercial interest . 
[PER Trupiano  ] 's summary judgment is that [PER Qadhafi  ] and senior [ORG GOL  ] leadership lack real strategic vision on how to reestablish meaningful ties with the outside world in the wake of the lifting of sanctions , but instead approach issues from an inherently tactical perspective , directly linking each [MISC Libyan  ] " concession " to " compensation " .
