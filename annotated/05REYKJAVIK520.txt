The following text updates for 2005 the [LOC Iceland  ] country section of the 2004 Patterns of [MISC Global Terrorism report: Iceland  ] has no military forces . 
Nevertheless , its leaders have offered strong rhetoric in support of [LOC U.S.  ] antiterrorism policies , and the [ORG Icelandic Crisis Response Unit  ] ( [ORG ICRU  ] ) , a [ORG Ministry for Foreign Affairs-  ] run organization of peacekeepers , has contributed to counterterrorism efforts in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and elsewhere . 
There are no indications of the existence of terrorist groups operating inside [LOC Iceland  ] or of trafficking of weapons of mass destruction ( [ORG WMD  ] ) through the country 's territory . 
The country 's top [ORG Coast Guard  ] official has worried publicly , however , that the surrounding [LOC North Atlantic Ocean  ] receives insufficient surveillance by law enforcement. ---------- Operations ---------- During the year , two eight-person [ORG ICRU Mobile Observation Teams  ] deployed to [LOC Afghanistan  ] and were attached to PRTs in [LOC Meymana  ] ( deployed in September ) and [ORG Chagcharan  ] ( deployed in mid-October ) , with rotations of personnel planned at three-month intervals . 
In November , however , Foreign Minister [PER Geir H. Haarde  ] announced that due to safety concerns [MISC Icelandic  ] civilian peacekeepers would cease to participate in the [LOC PRT  ] in northern [LOC Afghanistan  ] , although they would continue to work in the western region while the security situation remained stable there . 
There are four [ORG ICRU  ] members in [LOC Sri Lanka  ] with the [MISC Norwegian-led  ] [LOC Sri Lanka  ] Monitoring Mission ( [ORG SLMM  ] ) . 
Currently one [MISC Icelandic  ] policeman is in [LOC Kosovo  ] with the international police force there . 
These peacekeeping deployments remain well short of the [ORG Icelandic Government  ] 's long- stated goal of 50 [ORG ICRU  ] peacekeepers in the field " at any given time " in 2006 . 
Wages and costs have apparently far exceeded government projections , and remaining funding has not allowed additional deployments. -------- Dialogue -------- Several exchange visits in support of security and antiterrorism occurred between [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG Icelandic Government  ] officials in 2005: -- In January the [ORG U.S. Coast Guard  ] ( [ORG USCG  ] ) 's Rotterdam- based [ORG U.S. International Port Security Liaison  ] Officer , with responsibility for [LOC Iceland  ] , visited [LOC Reykjavik  ] to tour port facilities and share strategies with maritime officials . 
She noted: " All entities are keenly aware of each other 's roles and their successful collaborative work is evident.Icelandic authorities are working to centralize their emergency response efforts , further improving communication as well as national security , e.g. three major ports in [LOC Reykjavik  ] have come together to form an [ORG Association of Icelandic Ports  ] and also the [ORG Icelandic Coast Guard/Maritime Traffic Center  ] is being relocated with the [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG Police/Emergency Response Center  ] where incidents can be managed with a more integrated approach . 
" -- In March the [ORG USCG  ] provided [ORG Icelandic Coast Guard  ] ( [ORG ICG  ] ) Director General [PER Georg Larusson  ] with a weeklong orientation to [ORG USCG  ] personnel , materiel , and facilities on the eastern seaboard . 
-- In May Embassy personnel arranged and partially funded extensive [LOC U.S.  ] travel and briefings for [PER Jon Bjartmarz  ] , Chief Superintendent , National Commissioner of Police Security Section , to familiarize him with [LOC U.S.  ] law enforcement best practices . 
-- Also in May , Embassy personnel organized , escorted , and partially funded travel of senior foreign affairs journalists from [MISC Icelandic  ] print and broadcast media to [LOC Brussels  ] , [LOC Vienna  ] , and [LOC Sarajevo  ] to study Alliance transformation , post-conflict reconstruction , counter- trafficking , and the broad work of the [ORG OSCE  ] in [LOC Eurasia  ] . 
-- [LOC Iceland  ] hosted [ORG USCG  ] Commandant Admiral [PER Thomas Collins  ] on a goodwill and familiarization visit July 1- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
In meetings with [PER Larusson  ] and Minister of [ORG Justice  ] and [ORG Ecclesiastical Affairs  ] [PER Bjorn Bjarnason  ] , Admiral [PER Collins  ] proposed training and acquisitions for the [ORG ICG  ] as well as ways to enhance interoperability . 
Following these exchanges Minister [PER Bjarnason  ] announced in September that the Government would purchase a new patrol vessel and a new airplane to replace aging existing assets . 
Two additional patrol vessels will be refitted . 
[PER Larusson  ] has maintained political pressure on his government to increase its spending on maritime security . 
Referring to the 1.8 million square kilometers of [MISC Icelandic  ] territorial waters , he warned a civic group in November , " This is probably the only ocean area in the world that is so little monitored . 
" He added that those sailing in the region were probably aware of its vulnerability and could plan " unsuitable acts . 
" He pledged to revise [ORG ICG  ] regulations to make weapons available on board patrol vessels and for the first time to give police training to crews , who already enjoy police authority . 
-- In November , a team from S/CT briefed senior officials from the [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG MFA  ] , [ORG Justice  ] Ministry , Police and [ORG Coast Guard  ] on State 's Foreign Emergency Support Team and other interagency crisis response capabilities . 
Later that month , the [MISC Icelandic  ] Police special forces unit carried out a hostage rescue exercise inside the [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy . 
The Icelanders undertook to continue to work through the Embassy to strengthen counterterrorism contingency planning. ------------- Moral Support ------------- [MISC Icelandic  ] Prime Minister [PER Halldor Asgrimsson  ] condemned the July 7 terrorist attacks on the [LOC London  ] transit system by saying they were great acts of cruelty against innocent citizens . 
He also stated , " These were attacks not only on the [MISC British  ] nation but also on our shared democratic and national values . 
" Minister of [PER Justice Bjarnason  ] , responding to questions about [MISC Icelandic  ] anti-terror preparedness in the wake of the [LOC London  ] bombings , outine a multi-pronged [MISC Icelandic  ] approach , including: -- updating police organization to reduce the number of districts nationwide and achieve economies of scale ; -- strengthening the [ORG Special Unit  ] ( an elite [MISC SWAT-type  ] police organization ) by increasing manpower ; -- increasing monitoring of foreigners ; -- maintaining [ORG Keflavik International Airport  ] 's preeminence in use of the most advanced security technology ; and -- devising plans on how to respond to chemical , biological , or radiolical attack . 
[LOC Iceland  ] is a party to all 12 international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism ; and has signed the [MISC Nuclear Terrorism Convention  ] . 
In May [LOC Iceland  ] signed both the [ORG Council of Europe Convention  ] on the [ORG Prevention of Terrorism CETS No.  ] 196 and the [ORG Council of Europe Convention  ] on Laundering , Search , Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime and on the Financing of [ORG Terrorism CETS No.  ] 198 ; both are slated for ratification by the [ORG Althing  ] ( parliament ) in 2006 . 
Speaking at the [ORG UN General Assembly  ] in September , both [PER Asgrimsson  ] and then-Foreign Minister [PER David Oddsson  ] supported adoption of the [MISC Comprehensive Convention  ] on [ORG International Terrorism  ] . 
" Such a convention must unconditionally condemn terrorism . 
For it to be fully effective , it must include a legal definition of terrorist acts , " [PER Oddsson  ] declared . 
[PER Asgrimsson  ] reiterated , " ( A ) universal definition is still needed . 
Terrorism is a threat to us all and must be condemned in all its forms . 
" --------- Exercises --------- The [ORG Icelandic Coast Guard  ] hosted its fourth annual explosive ordnance disposal ( [ORG EOD  ] ) training exercise , [LOC Northern Challenge  ] , from August 29 to September 2 . 
This year 's exercise was attended by teams from [LOC Denmark  ] , [LOC Norway  ] , the [LOC United Kingdom  ] and [LOC Sweden  ] ( the first [MISC Partnership for Peace  ] team to attend ) for a total of 47 [ORG EOD  ] technicians . 
The exercise objectives were: ( 1 ) to provide a realistic training exercise , where NATO/PfP [ORG EOD  ] teams could hone their skills and procedures in dealing with a number of EOD/IEDD tasks , and ( 2 ) provide a platform for discussion and exchange of ideas regarding [ORG EOD  ] and [ORG Innovative Explosive Ordnance Disposal  ] ( [ORG IEDD  ] ) operations . 
Formally the exercise fulfilled the requirements of the 2000 Implementing Agreement Pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding between [LOC Iceland  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] regarding ICD [ORG EOD  ] and [ORG IDF  ] cooperation , specifically in the areas of [ORG EOD  ] training and exercise . 
In support of maritime security , the [ORG ICG  ] has given increased attention to scenarios involving large passenger and cargo vessels . 
In August , the [ORG ICG EOD  ] unit conducted a bomb disposal exercise at [LOC Sundahofn  ] port in [LOC Reykjavik  ] on an [MISC American  ] cruise liner , the [ORG Seven Seas Navigator  ] . 
The exercise was a cooperative effort between members of the [ORG ICG  ] , the [ORG Maritime Control Authority  ] and the ship 's security officer . 
On September 28 , the fuel tanker [PER USNS Gianella  ] arrived at the [LOC Helguvik NATO  ] fuel pier carrying 9.8 million gallons . 
For maritime security , the [LOC Iceland  ] [MISC Defense Force  ] ( [ORG IDF  ] ) requested [ORG ICG  ] assistance in pier sweeps and harbor patrol .
