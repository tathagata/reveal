[LOC KABUL  ] 2807 Classified By: AMBASSADOR KARL EIKENBERRY FOR REASONS 1.4 ( b ) & ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C/NF ) SUMMARY: While the international community works to grow the [ORG Afghan National Security Forces  ] ( [ORG ANSF  ] ) , local communities and the [MISC Afghan  ] government ( [ORG GIRoA  ] ) are resorting to various unconventional security forces to protect communities from insurgents . 
These forces range from the [MISC U.S.-supported  ] , GIRoA-controlled [MISC Afghan  ] Public Protection Program ( [ORG AP3  ] , refs [ORG A-C  ] ) to warlord [PER Mir Alam Khan  ] 's [LOC Kunduz  ] militia ( ref D ) , which is reportedly connected to the [ORG National Directorate of Security  ] ( [ORG NDS  ] ) but seems to operate without government guidance , command or control . 
Private security companies , arbakai ( local tribal self-defense forces ) , and local election security forces round out the picture , while [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Forces-Afghanistan  ] ( [MISC USFOR-A  ] ) is laying groundwork for a [MISC GIRoA-backed  ] village guard program known as the [ORG Community Defense Initiative  ] . 
The proliferation of these local and private bodies attests to deficiencies in the strength and quality of regular security forces and a lack of public confidence in the police . 
Interior Minister [PER Hanif Atmar  ] is trying to shape [MISC Afghan  ] communities' responses to insecurity , heading-off the creation of independent militia forces that could challenge or undermine the [ORG ANSF  ] . 
[PER Atmar  ] also envisions gradually replacing private [MISC Afghan  ] security companies ( PSCs ) , with a public guard force paid and controlled by his ministry. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) We believe that until we can build sufficient [ORG ANSF  ] to secure the population , the [LOC U.S.  ] should follow [PER Atmar  ] 's pragmatic approach -- that local solutions are permissible only as a closely monitored and tightly controlled stop-gap measure tied to [ORG ANSF  ] , that can either be demobilized or merged into the [ORG Afghan National Police  ] and [ORG Army  ] as those institutions grow . 
Otherwise , [LOC U.S.  ] support for unconventional forces ( particularly if they prove prone to manipulation by local power-brokers ) could undercut popular and international support for funding formal security forces and reinforce a traditional worst practice -- the arming of ethnic or sub-tribal militias that could divide [MISC Afghan  ] communities and spark additional violence . 
END SUMMARY MOI: KEEP A SHORT LEASH ON UNCONVENTIONAL SECURITY FORCES --------------------------------------------- ------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) While many senior [ORG GIRoA  ] officials -- including [ORG Rural Reconstruction  ] and Development Minister [PER Ehsan Zia  ] , Defense Minister [PER Wardak  ] and [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Army Operations  ] Chief LTG Sher [PER Karimi  ] -- oppose unconventional security forces in principle , Interior Minister [PER Hanif Atmar  ] appears to have the best developed sense among [MISC Afghan  ] leaders of how to restrain them in practice ) not by suppressing them but by shaping and overseeing them . 
LTG [PER Jamal Abdulnaseer Siddique  ] , Deputy Interior Minister for Strategy and Policy , and [PER Atmar  ] 's highest-ranking political appointee , told [MISC Pol-Mil  ] Officer that [PER Atmar  ] wants to use the traditional militia concept but tame it and bring it under state control . 
Locals who are loyal to the government and register their existing arms could serve as police auxiliaries , receiving food and even some pay from [ORG MOI  ] in return for helping the police . 
[PER Atmar  ] 's longest-serving advisor , [PER Habib Wayand  ] , explained that the Minister prefers to encourage small groups linked to local shuras , rather than large militias that might bite back or prove loyal to commanders with their own agendas. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) These local auxiliaries must be compensated individually by the Ministry , not through their commanders , who could siphon off compensation or use funds to build a force loyal to themselves . 
Minister [PER Atmar  ] 's model for local security is the [MISC Afghan  ] Public Protection Program ( [ORG AP3  ] ) , in which local shuras select young men who are vetted by [ORG GIRoA  ] institutions , trained by [ORG U.S. Special Forces  ] and paid by [ORG MOI  ] for static guard duties , and answer to local police commanders . 
[PER Atmar  ] wants [ORG AP3  ] to expand to other provinces and eventually merge its members into the [LOC KABUL  ] 00003661 002 OF 005 regular police force . 
AP3: EARLY SUCCESSES , BUT EXPANSION ON HOLD ------------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) [ORG AP3  ] is not expanding at this juncture , but taking stock . 
From March to August , the [MISC USFOR-A  ] element known as [ORG Combined Forces Special Operations Component Command Afghanistan  ] ( [ORG CFSOCC-A  ] ) trained and deployed 548 locals as community guardians in four districts in [LOC Wardak  ] province as part of the [ORG AP3  ] program ( ref A ) . 
[ORG CFSOCC-A  ] has a fifth class of at least 150 men on hold while it works with [ORG MOI  ] to reform the command and control structure for [ORG AP3  ] , establishing clear lines of authority from [ORG MOI  ] to the district level . 
[ORG CFSOCC-A  ] is also working with [ORG Combined Security Transition Command Afghanistan  ] ( [ORG CSTC-A  ] ) to fix food allowance payments and distribution of cold weather gear . 
[ORG AP3  ] expansion also awaits ISAF/ANSF efforts to clear more of [PER Wardak  ] 's [MISC Seyeedabad  ] district of insurgents , creating space for [ORG AP3  ] recruitment. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) The guardians have had notable successes -- in October , they discovered and dismantled eight [MISC IEDs  ] , more than any other [ORG ANSF  ] unit in [LOC Wardak  ] . 
[ORG Wardak  ] Governor [PER Mohammad Halim Fedai  ] , in a letter to the [ORG Independent Directorate of Local Governance  ] , states that the additional security [ORG AP3  ] guardians have provided has allowed the provincial government to step up mobile police patrols ; open schools ; convene public meetings ; enjoy a significant reduction in rocket attacks and IED emplacements ; ramp up work on the [LOC Maydan Shahr  ] - [LOC Bamyan  ] highway ; and , reduce travel time on other highways by deterring insurgents and criminals from shaking down motorists. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) However , the Governor also complained about problems with pay and equipment and expressed concern that [ORG AP3  ] no longer receives the same high-level attention from [LOC U.S.  ] forces and [ORG MOI  ] that it did at its inception . 
He pointed to confusion over command and control and a dearth of promised development projects for [MISC APPF  ] districts . 
( COMMENT: To the extent that [ORG AP3  ] is succeeding , it is because communities accept the guardians and are willing to put their young men in uniform , on the government payroll , and under the authority of the police . 
In communities with stronger insurgent support -- such as [PER Wardak  ] 's [MISC Sayeedabad  ] district -- it may be more difficult for locals to accept police in any form . 
END COMMENT . 
) [MISC MIR ALAM'S KUNDUZ MILITIA:  ] OVERTONES OF ETHNIC WARFARE --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) In July , [LOC Kunduz  ] Governor [PER Mohammad Omar  ] asked Minister [PER Atmar  ] to expand [ORG AP3  ] to his province , but the Minister was unable to do so as the program was still in its trial phase . 
[PER Omar  ] and his [ORG NDS  ] chief then asked for the support of [MISC Tajik  ] and [MISC Uzbek  ] militia forces under former [ORG Northern Alliance  ] commander [PER Mir Alam Khan  ] ( ref D ) . 
While [PER Khan  ] claims that his 500-man militia is under the legal control of the [ORG NDS  ] , he maintains operational control of the force and distributes its pay . 
( COMMENT: This is likely a meaningless distinction -- the [LOC Kunduz  ] [ORG NDS  ] Chief is [PER Mir Alam Khan  ] 's brother-in-law . 
END COMMENT . 
) <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) Armed with weapons cached earlier this decade while [PER Mir Alam Khan  ] participated in Disarmament , Demobilization , and Reintegration ( [ORG DDR  ] ) , his militia has killed four [MISC Taliban  ] commanders and 47 fighters , and captured 20 villages previously under [MISC Taliban  ] control . 
The initiative is entirely local -- [ORG MOI  ] contacts told [MISC Pol-Mil  ] officer that the Ministry was not involved with the [LOC Kunduz  ] militia , and demurred when he asked whether this initiative crossed Minister [PER Atmar  ] 's red-lines on unconventional security forces . 
[PER Mir Alam Khan  ] likely does not need [ORG MOI  ] support -- reporting indicates that Vice President [PER Massoud  ] and [PER Marshal Fahim Khan  ] both support [PER Mir Alam  ] 's efforts , which are locally popular as well. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) [LOC Kunduz  ] 's demographics -- the province 's [LOC Pashtun  ] population , at 36 percent , is the highest in [LOC RC-North  ] -- may account for [MISC Tajik  ] and [MISC Uzbek  ] anxiety . 
Pashtuns' exclusion [LOC KABUL  ] 00003661 003 OF 005 from local political power after 2001 may account for their discontent and support for insurgent groups . 
In an October meeting with a senior [LOC U.S.  ] military leader , [PER Mir Alam Khan  ] made an illustrative claim -- that [LOC Kunduz  ] 's security problems derived from the [ORG DDR  ] and Disarmament of Illegally Armed Groups ( DIAG ) programs , which disarmed local ( [MISC Tajik  ] and [MISC Uzbek  ] ) commanders and , in his view , enabled [MISC Taliban  ] to enter the province and local anti-GIROA [MISC Pashtuns  ] to assert themselves . 
PRIVATE SECURITY AND PUBLIC GUARDS: [PER ATMAR  ] TAMES A BEAST --------------------------------------------- ---------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Over the next five years , Minister [PER Atmar  ] envisions replacing [LOC Afghanistan  ] 's fifty-two registered private security companies ( [ORG PSCs  ] ) with a public guard force paid by customers but administered by [ORG MOI  ] . 
The force would guard private businesses , [ORG ISAF  ] supply convoys and bases , infrastructure , and construction projects . 
Its size would vary according to demand but could reach 47,000 above and beyond the regular police ceiling ( currently 96,800 , likely to rise to 160,000 in 2010 ) . 
While the public guard concept would leave room for international security providers with specialized services ( e.g . 
Ghurkha guards for international organizations and Embassies ) it would effectively nationalize the [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG PSCs  ] and put their estimated 30,000 employees under [ORG MOI  ] control. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Atmar  ] 's advisors argue that there is precedent for a public guard in the [ORG Faryab  ] 500 ( a local police force in [LOC Ghowrmach  ] district , administered from [ORG Faryab  ] province , which is paid for by the [ORG Asian Development Bank  ] to secure a bank-funded portion of [LOC Ring Road  ] construction ; ref E ) , and the [LOC Aynak  ] copper mine and [PER Salma  ] ( [LOC Herat  ] ) dam projects , where [MISC Chinese  ] and [MISC Indian  ] developers pay police salaries . 
[PER Atmar  ] 's advisors described his motivations to us: a public guard would help [ORG MOI  ] grow the police force beyond the level donors are presently willing to fund ; it would be a revenue source for [ORG MOI  ] ; by controlling pay for private guards it would lessen competition for [ORG ANSF  ] recruiting ; and , it would bring privately-controlled armed groups under government authority . 
( COMMENT: There are practical and political difficulties with the Public Guard concept . 
The [ORG Faryab  ] 500 are experiencing high turnover due to irregular payment by [ORG MOI  ] . 
This is in spite of the [ORG Asian Development Bank  ] regularly paying [ORG MOI  ] via the [ORG Finance Ministry  ] . 
Current [LOC U.S.  ] law does not allow the military to contract security from another government . 
Many [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG PSCs  ] are a lucrative source of income for former warlords and other influential power-brokers , who will likely oppose nationalization . 
END COMMENT ) <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Atmar  ] 's [ORG UN  ] advisor told us in October that [ORG MOI  ] had recently bowed to political pressure and licensed 15 new private security companies ( adding to an original list of 39 ) . 
Several were linked to political power-brokers , including [PER Mallik Zarin  ] of [LOC Konar  ] and [PER Siddique Mojaddedi  ] , the [ORG Meshrano Jirga  ] speaker 's son . 
( [PER Mojaddedi  ] , who ran a [ORG PSC  ] in [LOC Australia  ] , also seeks to be [PER Atmar  ] 's advisor on the subject -- a move resisted by the Minister thus far . 
) Several sources close to [PER Atmar  ] describe him as reluctantly bowing to political pressure from well-connected security entrepreneurs , but with a plan to ultimately supplant them . 
[PER Atmar  ] 's anxiety over [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG PSCs  ] is part and parcel of his concern over non-state actors with arms -- such as the [LOC Kunduz  ] militia -- who are privately controlled and owe their loyalty to paymasters outside of government control. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C/NF ) [ORG ISAF  ] , [ORG USFOR-A  ] , and [ORG Embassy Kabul  ] are discussing and will soon raise with [PER Atmar  ] an alternative approach to a public guard: stricter [ORG MoI  ] licensing and regulation of [ORG PSCs  ] . 
We believe this could meet [PER Atmar  ] , s professed sovereignty concerns regarding oversight of the [ORG PSC  ] function while avoiding the bureaucratic complications of trying to add the management of thousands of [ORG PSC  ] personnel to a Ministry already struggling with police growth . 
ARBAKAI FOR ELECTIONS AND THE PALACE CONNECTION --------------------------------------------- -- [LOC KABUL  ] 00003661 004 OF 005 <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C/NF ) During the first round of this year 's elections , deputized locals worked with [ORG ANSF  ] to provide additional security at polling stations , but their role was limited and many were not paid as promised ( ref F ) . 
[ORG MOI  ] contacts assert that the [ORG Palace  ] , rather than [ORG MOI  ] , was responsible for paying these local auxiliaries . 
[ORG MOI  ] sources allege that Presidential advisor and head of the [ORG Independent Directorate for Protection of Public Properties  ] and Highways [PER Mohammad Arif Khan Noorzai  ] ( who is also [PER Ahmad Wali Karzai  ] 's brother-in-law ) was in charge of these efforts . 
In September , when tribal leaders from [LOC Khost  ] sought government support to pay 100 arbakai ( traditional community security guards who answer to local shuras ) per district , they approached [PER Noorzai  ] rather than [ORG MOI  ] , MOD , or NDS . 
[PER Noorzai  ] reportedly told elders that the [ORG Palace  ] had no budget to support them . 
[PER Noorzai  ] 's role , and that of his directorate , are ambiguous , but at least some [MISC Afghans  ] view him as a source of financial support for unconventional security forces outside of regular security ministries. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Even without [ORG Palace  ] support , some locals are establishing and funding militia of their own . 
In the [MISC Loya Paktia  ] region of [LOC RC-East  ] ( the only region of the country with a real tradition of arbakai or tribal levies ) , the [MISC Zazi  ] ( [MISC Jaji  ] ) tribe has raised an arbakai to keep insurgents out of their communities ( septel ) . 
Their initiative is a reaction against insurgent violence , but also reflects their dissatisfaction with the government , which they do not trust to protect them . 
[ORG CDI  ] IN INITIAL PHASE PENDING [ORG GIRoA  ] APPROVAL ------------------------------------------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG CFSOCC-A  ] is conducting survey work and tribal engagement for its [ORG Community Defense Initiative  ] ( [ORG CDI  ] ) a program whereby [ORG U.S. Special Forces  ] ( [ORG ODA  ] ) teams would provide embedded training , communications equipment and ammunition to local communities with a proven track record of opposing insurgents . 
( [ORG CDI  ] would not provide arms , however , as [ORG CFSOCC-A  ] assesses that the communities in question have plenty of their own , nor does [ORG CFSOCC-A  ] intend to provide stipends to village guards . 
) [ORG CFSOCC-A  ] contends that [ORG ODA  ] training and the ability reliably to call for assistance from [LOC ISAF/GIRoA  ] forces would better enable these communities to exclude insurgents from their territory and report on their movements . 
[ORG CFSOCC-A  ] tentatively plans to introduce the concept in nine districts of [MISC Regional Commands South  ] , [LOC East  ] , and [LOC West  ] , where [ORG ANSF  ] are absent . 
[ORG CFSOCC-A  ] has begun outreach on [ORG CDI  ] to local shuras. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) That said , while senior [ORG ISAF  ] officers have sought [ORG GIRoA  ] ministers' approval of [ORG CDI  ] , and have underscored the need for transition of [ORG CDI  ] to [ORG GIRoA  ] oversight , [ORG GIRoA  ] has not formally approved the program . 
In a meeting on October 27 , the Ambassador briefed [ORG National Security Advisor  ] [PER Rassoul  ] on the parameters of the [ORG CDI  ] program . 
The Ambassador noted that the program had great merits but would need the firm approval of the President and the cabinet before implementation . 
Rassoul demurred , suggesting that the [ORG Embassy  ] raise the issue with President [PER Karzai  ] , who he said has concerns over the program . 
The Ambassador reiterated that there must be clear , collective [MISC Afghan  ] ownership of such a program . 
Toward this purpose , we are developing with [ORG USFOR-A  ] a draft agreement on [ORG CDI  ] among [ORG U.S. Forces Afghanistan  ] , [ORG GIRoA  ] ministries ( including the [ORG Ministries of Defense and Interior  ] ) , and the [ORG National Security Advisor  ] , which includes a commitment for [ORG CDI  ] 's transition to [ORG GIRoA  ] control . 
Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] has informed [ORG U.S. Forces Afghanistan  ] that he will not authorize the use of 1208 funding , nor the deployment of [ORG USG  ] civilian personnel in support of [ORG CDI  ] operations , until [ORG GIRoA  ] has signed an agreement clearly delineating its own responsibility for such a program ( including selection of a lead ministry whose minister would become personally responsible for the program ; SEPTEL to follow ) . 
COMMENT: SUPPORT AFGHANS' BEST IMPULSES , NOT THEIR WORST HABITS --------------------------------------------- ----------- [LOC KABUL  ] 00003661 005 OF 005 <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C/NF ) Insufficient security forces , coupled with poor police performance and corruption , contribute to locals' sense that [ORG GIRoA  ] cannot protect them , and that the [ORG ANSF  ] may , indeed , sometimes pose a threat . 
As we strengthen and grow the [ORG ANSF  ] , particularly the police , they will be better able to earn the people 's trust , binding communities to their government through the provision of security and justice . 
However , full [ORG ANSF  ] development will take at least four years , and communities' security needs are immediate . 
[MISC Afghans  ] will resort to traditional self-defense mechanisms in the meantime , but unsupervised , those mechanisms can tend in dangerous directions . 
[PER Mir Alam  ] 's [LOC Kunduz  ] militia -- ethnically divisive , controlled by one man , grounded in contempt for DIAG and the rule of law -- exemplifies a quick fix with dangerous implications: tactical gains at strategic cost. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C/NF ) In contrast , Minister [PER Atmar  ] 's policy of shaping and controlling these local initiatives seems a pragmatic way of asserting [ORG GIRoA  ] 's sovereignty over armed persons , along with a degree of influence . 
There is a wide gulf between AP3 and the [LOC Kunduz  ] militia . 
Local arbakai could move toward either pole depending on incentives and the signals we and [ORG GIRoA  ] send . 
Clear redlines on unconventional security forces from [ORG GIRoA  ] , and clear [LOC U.S.  ] support for those redlines could avert the re-armament of the [MISC Afghan  ] countryside that competing local militias would likely engender. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C/NF ) Correspondingly , ambiguous [LOC U.S.  ] policies , or our tolerance of or support for un-regulated forces , would encourage some of the worst [MISC Afghan  ] traditional tendencies and undermine popular and international support for further [ORG ANSF  ] development . 
It would also raise suspicions of our intentions among [MISC Afghans  ] who perceived themselves as victims of various militias . 
The best way to meet local communities' legitimate security needs while we grow the police and army is to insist that local security initiatives remain tightly-controlled by [ORG GIRoA  ] and monitored by the international community . 
These can remain somewhat improvisational , as stop-gap measures eventually to be demobilized or merged into the police and army . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] should only deploy its resources and prestige in support of programs that reflect [ORG GIRoA  ] 's highest standards , not traditional bad habits .
