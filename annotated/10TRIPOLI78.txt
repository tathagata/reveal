Cretz  ] , Ambassador , [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy [LOC Tripoli  ] , [ORG Department of State  ] .

( C ) Summary: [LOC Libya  ] 's Justice Minister-equivalent , [PER Mustafa Mohammad Abduljalil  ] , told the Ambassador on January 25 that as [LOC Libya  ] opens its economy to other countries , it needs international assistance in developing its private sector and strengthening the commercial legal environment . 
The Ambassador thanked [PER Abduljalil  ] for his support of the [ORG USG-funded Commercial Law Development Program  ] 's ( [ORG CLDP  ] ) work in [LOC Libya  ] , including securing visas for the recent second visit to [LOC Libya  ] of a [LOC U.S.  ] federal judge and the [ORG CLDP  ] program manager . 
[PER Abduljalil  ] said an upcoming February trip to the [LOC U.S.  ] of three [MISC Libyan  ] judges ( at the invitation of [ORG CLDP  ] ) would provide the [MISC Libyans  ] with new ideas and generate proposals for future cooperation . 
[PER Abduljalil  ] said [LOC Libya  ] 's reform of its [ORG Criminal Code  ] had moved to the General People 's [ORG Congress  ] ( [LOC Libya  ] 's parliament-equivalent ) for discussion . 
While [PER Abduljalil  ] has given the green light to his staff to work with us , he noted that many [MISC Libyans  ] are still " concerned " about the [ORG USG  ] 's support for [LOC Israel  ] , and that terrorism stems from the perception that [LOC Europe  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] are " against " [MISC Muslims  ] . 
End Summary . 
POSITIVE COOPERATION IN COMMERCIAL LAW PROGRAMS <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On January 25 , the Ambassador ( accompanied by econoff ) met for the first time with [PER Mustafa Mohammad Abduljalil  ] , Secretary of the General People 's Committee for Justice ( Minister of Justice-equivalent ) . 
The Ambassador stressed the importance of a sound commercial legal environment to [LOC Libya  ] 's economic development . 
He noted that [ORG CLDP  ] is an example of the type of bilateral program that can improve the legal environment , and thanked the Secretary for his help in obtaining [MISC Libyan  ] visas for the [LOC U.S.  ] participants of recent [ORG CLDP  ] workshops . 
[PER Abduljalil  ] expressed his own support for the [ORG CLDP  ] programs and bilateral cooperation in general , stating that " less talk and more action is best " when it comes to moving the relationship forward. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The Ambassador previewed for [PER Abduljalil  ] the upcoming [MISC CLDP-sponsored  ] trip to [LOC New York  ] and [LOC Washington  ] of three [MISC Libyan  ] judicial officials . 
[PER Abduljalil  ] said that as [LOC Libya  ] was now opening up its economy and developing a private sector , it needed to strengthen its commercial laws , and that such trips to the [LOC U.S.  ] would provide the [MISC Libyans  ] with new ideas . 
This was " essential " as , after many years of sanctions and international isolation , the [MISC Libyans  ] know very little about the [LOC U.S.  ] system of government . 
He said they were also interested in discussing a system for prisoner exchange to provide for the repatriation of [MISC Libyans  ] imprisoned in the [LOC U.S.  ] and for [LOC U.S.  ] citizens in [MISC Libyan  ] prisons . 
( Note: We are not aware of any [MISC Americans  ] currently in [MISC Libyan  ] prisons . 
End note . 
) He said [LOC Libya  ] had negotiated such agreements with other countries and hoped to do the same with the [LOC U.S.  ] He would ask the three officials to write a report after their upcoming trip , including proposals for other areas of cooperation . 
STATUS OF LIBYA'S CRIMINAL LAW REFORM PROJECT <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Abduljalil  ] said the [ORG GOL  ] has been working on reforming [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG Criminal Code  ] for 4-5 years and that the revised legislation is currently being discussed in the General People 's [ORG Congress  ] . 
He noted that [LOC Libya  ] is trying to incorporate alternatives to prison sentences for some crimes , including a system for imposing fines instead of jail-time , as well as community service . 
Ideally , the death penalty would be a sentence reserved only in cases of murder , he explained . 
Regarding other penalties , such as charges brought against those who speak against the government , [PER Abduljalil  ] maintained that [MISC Libyans  ] could " say anything they wanted " in the forum of the General People 's [ORG Congress  ] . 
He insisted that journalists were free to write anything they chose , provided they did not make personal accusations against anyone ( i.e. , slander ) . 
FROM CRIMINALS TO ISRAEL: JUDGE ACCUSES [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC EUROPE  ] OF BEING AGAINST ISLAM <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In the course of the discussion of the [ORG Criminal Code  ] , [PER Abduljalil  ] abruptly changed the subject from freedom of speech to the " [MISC Libyan  ] people 's concern about the [LOC U.S.  ] government 's support for [LOC Israel  ] . 
" He averred that [LOC Libya  ] cares deeply about [MISC Muslims  ] everywhere , and about [MISC Muslim  ] countries . 
In his view , the root cause of terrorism stems from the perception that [LOC Europe  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] are against [MISC Muslims  ] . 
He believed that " justice is for everyone , " and that if [LOC Libya  ] does not uphold that tenet , then terrorists will find a foothold in [LOC Libya  ] . 
The Ambassador replied that the [LOC U.S.  ] is committed to a positive [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000078 002.2 OF 002 relationship with the [MISC Muslim  ] world , referencing the President 's 2009 speech in [LOC Cairo  ] . 
He said it is important to continue the discussion of sensitive topics in order to develop a mature relationship between our two countries . 
Through the [ORG Human Rights Dialogue  ] ( [ORG HRD  ] ) , the [LOC U.S.  ] hopes to continue the discussion with [LOC Libya  ] on such topics in a discreet , mutually respectful manner , which [PER Abduljalil  ] appeared to appreciate . 
The Ambassador gave [PER Abduljalil  ] a copy of the diplomatic note proposing the [ORG HRD  ] working groups and invited his input . 
BIO NOTE AND COMMENT <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Abduljalil  ] was named Secretary of the General People 's Committee for Justice in January 2007 . 
He does not speak [MISC English  ] , and spoke only [MISC Arabic  ] in our meeting . 
According to a recent report by [ORG Human Rights Watch  ] ( [ORG HRW  ] ) , he has expressed reformist ideas about eliminating corruption within the [ORG GOL  ] and bringing security organizations in line with the rule of law . 
In [ORG HRW  ] 's assessment , [PER Abduljalil  ] 's drive to change the system is driven more by his conservative point of view rather than a reformist agenda . 
According to his staff and several judges , he is well-regarded and considered to be fair . 
The Ambassador 's initial meeting with [PER Abduljalil  ] was positive and encouraging . 
Through his staff , including Director of [ORG International Cooperation Kamal  ] al-Bahri , [PER Abduljalil  ] has demonstrated an interest in working with us on the [ORG Commercial Law Development Program  ] over the past year and a willingness to allow his staff to communicate with emboffs outside of official channels . 
This was evidenced by his securing visa approvals for visiting [ORG CLDP  ] officials . 
( Note: His organization seems to have a parallel track in securing visa approvals , bypassing Protocol and the [ORG MFA  ] , as the [ORG Embassy  ] received the approval numbers for the [ORG CLDP  ] visitors directly from the [ORG GPC  ] for Justice and not through the [ORG MFA  ] as usual ; in fact , the visas for the two [ORG CLDP  ] visitors are among the very few USG visas we have received in the past few months . 
End note . 
) The next step will be to continue the discussion of how we can work with the [ORG GPC  ] for Justice in other , more sensitive areas , such as the [ORG Human Rights Dialogue  ] . 
We also committed to providing the Minister with [LOC U.S.  ] laws and explanations showing how we handled the issues of free association and free speech balanced against the security needs of the nation .
