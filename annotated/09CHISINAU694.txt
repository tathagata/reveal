[PER Sukhee  ] was candid in his meetings with poloff , referring repeatedly and openly to his handwritten notes from the [MISC DPRK  ] consultations. ------------------------------------------- [MISC DPRK  ] DELEGATION OFFERS NO CRITICISM OF [LOC U.S.  ] ------------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) [PER Sukhee  ] indicated that VFM [PER Kim  ] met with [ORG MFAT State  ] Secretary [ORG Tsogtbaatar  ] for the consultations and also held a separate meeting with President [PER Elbegdorj  ] on the margins Monday . 
The [MISC Mongolian  ] Deputy Foreign Minister was to lead this latter meeting but was unable due to an obligation . 
[PER Sukhee  ] said the meetings were notable for several reasons: the [MISC DPRK  ] delegation did not read from a prepared script , they were not aggressive and made no criticism of the [LOC United States  ] , and they criticized [LOC China  ] and [LOC Russia  ] “three or four times” for supporting recent [ORG UN Resolutions  ] aimed at the [MISC DPRK  ] . 
What follows in paras 4 through 12 is Sukhee’s description to poloff of the [MISC DPRK’s  ] statements during the course of the consultations: ---------------------------- [MISC DPRK  ] VFM ON DENUCLEARIZATION ---------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) VFM [PER Kim  ] said the [MISC DPRK  ] is spending too much on weapons rather than on its children , but that the current reality dictates that they cannot get away from weapons for now . 
[PER Kim  ] said the [MISC DPRK  ] is not a threat and was only interested in self-protection . 
The [MISC Mongolian  ] side expressed concern that a nuclear [ORG DPRK  ] could lead to a nuclear [LOC ROK  ] , [LOC Japan  ] , [LOC Syria  ] , and [LOC Iran  ] , and urged that the [MISC Mongolian  ] nuclear-free model could serve as an example . 
[PER Kim  ] stated the [LOC United States  ] would not allow [LOC Japan  ] or the [LOC ROK  ] to go nuclear and that the [MISC DPRK  ] is committed to peace and denuclearization. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [MISC Mongolians  ] offered the example of the [LOC Soviet Union  ] and the [LOC United States  ] during the [MISC Reagan-Gorbachev  ] era , when the two allowed for nuclear inspections , leading to improved trust and a reduction in the number of warheads . 
The [MISC Mongolians  ] stated that if they were in the [MISC DPRK’s  ] place now , they would allow inspections , which would lead to mutual confidence and improved relations . 
The [MISC DPRK  ] side offered no reaction to the suggestion. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [ORG DPRK  ] side said what is most important is for the [LOC United States  ] and the [ORG DPRK  ] to come up with a “common language , ” a “non-aggression agreement , ” and establishment of diplomatic relations . 
[PER Kim  ] stated if the sides can take such measures , then denuclearization will be possible and easy , and that relations with [LOC Japan  ] and the [LOC ROK  ] will normalize thereafter. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [MISC Mongolian  ] side counseled that recent “provocations” ( this is Sukhee’s word to poloff ; another word may have been used in the consultations ) such as the missile test meant that the present situation was very fragile , and that the [ORG DPRK  ] should be careful not to present the wrong signal . 
[PER Kim  ] agreed that the [ORG DPRK  ] must be careful and must build confidence . 
The [MISC Mongolians  ] stated that even if one has peaceful intentions , one can be seen as provocative. -------------------------------- ON BILATERAL TALKS WITH THE [LOC U.S.  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) Regarding former President [PER Clinton’s  ] recent travel to the [ORG DPRK  ] to secure of the release of the two journalists , [PER Kim  ] said this action had been prepared for a long time , meaning the groundwork for such a visit was already in place because of the progress the [LOC United States  ] and the [ORG DPRK  ] made during the [PER Clinton  ] presidency . 
[PER Kim  ] said forward motion stopped during the [ORG Bush Administration  ] but was now able to proceed because of President [PER Clinton’s  ] recent involvement in a personal capacity , because President [PER Obama  ] is of the same party , and because former [ORG First Lady Clinton  ] is now the Secretary of State . 
The [LOC North Koreans  ] were expecting a dialogue with the [LOC United States  ] to start soon as an extension of President [PER Clinton’s  ] visit. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) [PER Kim  ] asked the [MISC Mongolians  ] to support a [MISC U.S.-DPRK  ] dialogue ( [PER Sukhee  ] described [PER Kim  ] as “enthusiastic” at this point ) , and he stated “there are no eternal enemies in this world.” ---------------------- ON THE SIX PARTY TALKS ---------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) [PER Kim  ] took a “very hard line” on the [ORG Six Party  ] Talks according to [PER Sukhee  ] , stating that the [ORG DPRK  ] will never return to the talks , that the talks were dead , but that the door has not closed on an opportunity for negotiations . 
During discussion of the [ORG Six Party  ] Talks , [PER Kim  ] criticized [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC China  ] for their support of recent [ORG UN  ] resolutions aimed at the [ORG DPRK  ] . 
[PER Kim  ] said [LOC Japan  ] and the [LOC ROK  ] were natural allies of the [LOC United States  ] during the talks , and that [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC China  ] ended up supporting the other three , so that the [ORG DPRK  ] felt it was five against one . 
[PER Kim  ] stated the real intention of the [ORG Six Party  ] Talks was to destroy the [ORG DPRK  ] regime , and that at present the [ORG DPRK  ] wants to talk only to the [LOC United States.  ] ------------------------------------------ VFM KIM’S MEETING WITH PRESIDENT [PER ELBEGDORJ  ] ------------------------------------------ <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Sukhee  ] also provided insight into Kim’s meeting with [PER Elbegdorj  ] on August 10: [PER Kim  ] refrained from criticizing the [LOC United States  ] and stated the [ORG DPRK  ] would be happy if the [ORG GOM  ] could support a [MISC U.S.-DPRK  ] dialogue “in the international arena.” [PER Kim  ] said to [PER Elbegdorj  ] , “We are telling you all this because [LOC Mongolia  ] understand us.” [PER Kim  ] reiterated the notion that there is a “good personal understanding” between former President [PER Clinton  ] and [ORG DPRK  ] leader [PER Kim Jong-Il.  ] -------------------------------------- HOW ABOUT [MISC U.S.-DPRK  ] TALKS IN [LOC MONGOLIA  ] ? -------------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Sukhee  ] further noted that a counselor named [PER Choi  ] from the [ORG DPRK  ] Embassy in [LOC Ulaanbaatar  ] told [PER Sukhee  ] on the way to the airport on August 11 that he had suggested to VFM [PER Kim  ] that it would be good to host [MISC U.S.-DPRK  ] talks in [LOC Mongolia  ] , but that [PER Kim  ] offered no reaction . 
[PER Choi  ] also told [PER Sukhee  ] that the timing was right to establish a regional security mechanism whose organization the Mongols should spearhead .
