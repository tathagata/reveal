REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( [LOC SBU  ] ) [LOC Libya  ] 's General People 's [ORG Congress  ] ( parliament-equivalent ) met January 26 in Sirte to open its 2010 session . 
Members of the diplomatic corps , including the Ambassador , were flown by the [ORG GOL  ] 400 km east of [LOC Tripoli  ] to witness the opening day proceedings . 
Delegates at the [ORG Congress  ] elected [PER Mohammed Bilqassim  ] al-Zway as Secretary-General , replacing [PER Imbarek  ] al-Shamekh as the body 's rough equivalent to Speaker of the [ORG House  ] . 
[PER Suliman Shahumi  ] retained his chair of the [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] committee ( a position he has held since March 2000 ) . 
[PER Mohammed Jbril  ] was named Secretary of Trade Unions , [PER Hosni Luhichi  ] as Secretary of Legal Affairs , and [PER Salima Abduljabbar  ] as Secretary of Women 's Affairs . 
2 . 
( C ) Bio note and comment: Al-Zway is thought to be a close , personal friend of [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] . 
He attended school with [PER Qadhafi  ] in [LOC Sebha  ] where the [ORG Free Officers' Movement  ] was incubated , and reportedly introduced al-Qadhafi to former PM-equivalent [PER Abdulsalam Jalloud  ] ( who , with al-Qadhafi , [PER Khweldi  ] al-Humeidi , and [PER Abu Bakr Jabir  ] , comprise the " Gang of Five " revolutionaries that led the 1969 coup ) . 
In addition to recent postings as ambassador to [LOC Rabat  ] and [LOC London  ] , he served as [LOC Libya  ] 's Permanent Representative to the [ORG UN  ] in the mid-1990s and was part of the contact group ( including [PER Abdulati  ] al-Obeidi ) charged with negotiating with [MISC Western  ] powers on [LOC Lockerbie  ] and other incidents . 
There was no [ORG Congress  ] agenda item , and no news emanating from the event , regarding [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi 's still-to-be-filled role as " General Coordinator of the People 's [MISC Social Leadership  ] , " indicating that [PER Saif  ] 's official acceptance and confirmation may still lie in the future . 
Taken with the reported bankruptcy and subsequent shuttering of [PER Saif  ] 's Oea and [ORG Qurina  ] newspapers earlier this week , the installation of [LOC Zway  ] -- a friend of old-guard revolutionaries -- may be a signal that [PER Saif  ] will have more limited powers in his new , yet-to-be-accepted position than commentators originally thought . 
End bio note and comment .
