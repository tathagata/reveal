Patterson  ] . 
Reasons 1.4 b and d. <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: With the [LOC Pakistan  ] military preparing to launch an operation against major terrorist safe havens in [LOC South Waziristan  ] , [LOC Pakistan  ] 's terrorist/extremist groups have dramatically increased their militant and propaganda operations in an effort to undermine public support . 
On the operational side , the [ORG Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan  ] ( [ORG TTP  ] ) now headed by an individual calling himself [PER Hakeemullah Mehsud  ] appears to be cooperating both with elements of al-Qaeda and with the [ORG Punjabi  ] terrorist organization [ORG Lashkar-e-Jhangvi  ] ( [ORG LJ  ] ) . 
While this is not the first time that we have seen cross-cooperation among these terrorist/extremist organizations , the intensity of attacks -- five in a single day on October 15 -- indicate that [ORG TTP  ] has both increased its cooperative outreach and its finances ( as [ORG LJ  ] does not work for free ) . <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In addition , the recent attacks demonstrate that [ORG TTP  ] and its allies have the capacity to evolve and vary the style of their attacks to exploit weaknesses in the [MISC Pakistani  ] security apparatus . 
The recent attacks involved both vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices ( [MISC VBIEDs  ] ) in the [LOC North West Frontier Province  ] and smaller attacks against high profile installations by armed individuals in security forces uniforms that can more easily penetrate [LOC Pakistan  ] security cordons in other parts of the country . 
There is information to suggest that women/men clad in burqas are now part of the mix of attackers . 
[ORG TTP  ] has been clear in its propaganda that these attacks are both in direct retaliation for [LOC Pakistan  ] government support for [MISC American  ] initiatives in countering violent extremism and because of the military 's upcoming [MISC Waziristan  ] operation . 
[ORG TTP  ] has gone so far as to promise an end to the attacks and its fighters participation in jihad against [LOC India  ] , if the [MISC Pakistani  ] government changes its foreign policy and establishes an " [MISC Islamic  ] " state . 
Despite these threats , the [LOC Pakistan  ] military continues its preparations for an offensive in [LOC South Waziristan  ] against the [ORG TTP  ] and their tribal allies to be launched in the next few weeks . 
End Summary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Beginning with the attack against the [ORG Askari Bank  ] in [LOC Peshawar  ] on September 26 , the [ORG Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan  ] ( [ORG TTP  ] ) has resumed its terrorist attacks in [LOC Pakistan  ] 's settled areas that had largely ceased following the death of [PER Baitullah Mehsud  ] . 
[ORG TTP  ] 's new campaign coincides with [LOC Pakistan  ] military preparations for an operation in [MISC South Waziristan  ] , including increased air strikes in [PER Mehsud  ] territory and with the consolidation of leadership power within [ORG TTP  ] in the hands of an individual referring to himself as [PER Hakeemullah Mehsud.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG TTP  ] and its al-Qaeda allies , who have been providing advice and logistical assistance to the organization in exchange for shelter with the [PER Mehsud  ] tribe in [LOC South Waziristan  ] , appear to have timed their renewed spate of attacks and the accompanying propaganda blitz to undermine public confidence in [LOC Pakistan  ] security forces just as preparations for the [MISC South Waziristan  ] operation were increasing . 
The terrorists appear to have read in on modern theories of asymmetrical warfare , including the tenet that public support will help determine the outcome of the struggle between government and anti-government actors . 
General [PER Kayani  ] told us repeatedly that strong public support was a key issue in his decision to move into [LOC Swat.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG TTP  ] is not , however , acting alone in carrying out the recent attacks . 
[ORG Al-Qaeda  ] advice , support , and possibly financing have long been a critical element in [ORG TTP  ] 's ability to carry-out spectacular attacks in [LOC Pakistan  ] 's settled areas . 
In addition , [ORG TTP  ] has allied on and off with various other [MISC Taliban-inspired  ] terrorist and criminal groups in [LOC Pakistan  ] 's [LOC North West Frontier Province  ] , including [PER Mengal Bagh  ] and the [PER Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat Mohammadi  ] ( [ORG TNSM  ] ) . <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In the recent attacks in the [MISC Pakistani  ] [LOC Punjab  ] , [ORG TTP  ] appears to have , as they did in 2008 , hired the services of [MISC Punjab-based  ] terrorist group [ORG Lashkar-e-Jhangvi  ] ( [ORG LJ  ] ) . 
[ORG LJ  ] , which began as a violent off-shot of [LOC Deobandi  ] sectarian extremist group [ORG Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan  ] ( [ORG SSP  ] ) in the 1990s , has steadily increased its target set from strictly [MISC Shias  ] , a minority in [LOC Pakistan  ] , to any group which does not share its strict , militant interpretation of [MISC Islam  ] , including the [LOC Pakistan  ] government and western interests . 
Since 2001 , [ORG LJ  ] has become essentially a " guns for hire " terrorist organization , prepared to carry out attacks on any non-Deobandi group in exchange for sizable cash payments . 
The latest attacks are also tied directly to [PER Ilyas Kashmiri  ] , who is affiliated with the anti-India terrorist group [ORG Harakat-ul-Jihad-e-Islami  ] ( [ORG HUJI  ] ) . 
[ORG HUJI  ] , along with other anti-India groups including [ORG Lashkar-e-Tayyaba  ] ( LeT ) and [ORG Jaish-e-Mohammad  ] ( [ORG JeM  ] ) , have increasingly shifted their focus to include [LOC Pakistan  ] government and western targets in [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC India  ] . 
They are also actively collaborating with [MISC Taliban  ] groups , including [ORG TTP  ] , sectarian extremist groups such as [ORG LJ  ] , and al-Qaeda. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The recent attacks demonstrate that [ORG TTP  ] and its allied groups are capable of adjusting their tactics and practices to counter [LOC Pakistan  ] government security measures . 
[ORG TTP  ] has continued to use vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices ( [ORG VBIED  ] ) against police and government installations in [LOC NWFP  ] -- where counter-measures are comparatively weaker . 
In [LOC Rawalpindi  ] , [LOC Islamabad  ] , and [LOC Lahore  ] , [ORG TTP  ] has started deploying single suicide bombers or small teams of suicide bombers and armed gunmen to target high-profile installations . 
These individual suicide bombers or small teams have begun wearing the uniforms of [MISC Pakistani  ] security personnel , which are easily available for purchase in any market and allow them to bypass security screening checkpoints unchallenged . 
There is information that women/men in burqas have also been part of the mix of attackers . 
While casualty tolls in these attacks are lower than in the [ORG VBIED  ] explosions , their ability to bypass security and penetrate into the General Headquarters of the [LOC Pakistan  ] Army , international organizations , and the headquarters of the [ORG Federal Investigation Agency  ] could have a devastating impact on public and security force morale. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) It is also possible , however , that the terrorists have not accurately assessed all quarters of [MISC Pakistani  ] public opinion . 
Most Punjabis were remarkably nonchalant about violence in the tribal areas prior to the March attack on the [MISC Sri Lankan  ] cricket team in [LOC Lahore  ] . 
Consulate [LOC Lahore  ] contacts have fallen into two camps in reaction to the October 15 ( and earlier but also recent ) attacks in the [LOC Punjab  ] . 
One camp does , indeed , bemoan the government 's incapacity and speaks pessimistically about the [ORG GOP  ] 's capacity to rally . 
Another camp speaks passionately of the importance of the [ORG GOP  ] 's civilian and military components joining to defeat the terrorists , and restore normalcy to [LOC Pakistan  ] , with some pride in the [ORG GOP  ] 's accomplishments to date . 
The attacks seem to have further invigorated this camp . 
Both camps insist that the violent extremists represent neither [MISC Islam  ] nor [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
Terrorist " messaging " is not having the desired impact in [LOC Lahore  ] . 
Even the anti-U.S. , nationalist daily " The [ORG Nation  ] " spoke highly of the " martyred " security forces who lost their lives in the October 15 attacks. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In addition to the increase in attacks , [ORG TTP  ] has equally launched a propaganda effort to break public support for the impending operation in [LOC South Waziristan  ] . 
The thrust of this propaganda effort has been that the attacks are in retaliation for the [LOC Pakistan  ] Army/government 's policy of supporting [LOC America  ] 's " war against [MISC Islam  ] " in [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[ORG TTP  ] has stressed that any action in [MISC Waziristan  ] is being carried out on instructions from the [LOC United States.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG TTP  ] spokespeople have promised that the campaign of attacks will end , if the [LOC Pakistan  ] government abandons its support of the [LOC United States  ] policy . 
In one recent statement , [ORG TTP  ] even offered to send its jihadi forces to [LOC Pakistan  ] 's eastern border with [LOC India  ] if the [LOC Pakistan  ] government turned [LOC Pakistan  ] into " an [MISC Islamic  ] state . 
" Such propaganda messages are clearly designed to damage the army and government 's image in the general public and decrease public and political support for what may be a prolonged military operation in [LOC South Waziristan.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Despite these attacks , we continue to receive solid evidence that the [LOC Pakistan  ] military is preparing to move forward with some kind of operation in [LOC South Waziristan  ] . 
For the last several days , we have witnessed renewed air strikes in the region designed to prepare the ground to facilitate offensive maneuver . 
In addition , we have seen continued movements of troops and supplies to tactical assembly areas in [LOC South Waziristan  ] and the positioning of [ORG Special Services Group  ] ( [ORG SSG  ] ) personnel for reconnaissance activities , which appear imminent . 
On October 16 , Chief of Army Staff [PER Ashfaq Pervaiz Kayani  ] made an unscheduled call to ISAF Commander [PER Gen. McChrystal  ] to advise that operations in [LOC South  ] [PER Waziristan  ] were imminent and to request that ISAF forces in [LOC Afghanistan  ] coordinate with the [MISC Pakistani  ] military to prevent the escape of militants across the border . 
Mission believes that the start of major ground combat operations may still be several days or more away as [ORG SSG  ] reconnaissance and additional air strikes are likely prior to the commencement of decisive operations. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Despite the positive indications that the [ORG Pakistan Army  ] intends to move into [LOC South Waziristan  ] , post remains uncertain as to the intended extent of the operation . 
There is no question that the [ORG Pakistan Army  ] intends to " punish " the [MISC Mehsud  ] tribe for its protection of [ORG TTP  ] and to dismantle as much [ORG TTP  ] infrastructure in [LOC South Waziristan  ] as possible . 
It is also likely that the [ORG Pakistan Army  ] will move against al-Qaeda elements that are inter-mingled with the [MISC Mehsud  ] tribe and supporting [ORG TTP  ] . 
It remains to be seen , however , that given the short time frame before a harsh winter sets into the [MISC Waziristans  ] that the [ORG Pakistan Army  ] is contemplating a full-scale clearance operation . 
There is no indication that the military intends to go after Commander [PER Nazir  ] , [PER Gulbuddin Hekmatyar  ] , the [MISC Haqqani  ] network , or their allied tribes -- all located in [LOC North Waziristan  ] -- as part of this operation . 
These elements that focus almost exclusively on cross-border attacks into [LOC Afghanistan  ] are not a high priority for the [LOC Pakistan  ] military , and , in the case of the [MISC Haqqanis  ] , it is not clear the [MISC Pakistani  ] military could achieve a decisive victory even if it wanted to do so .
