Patterson  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , told [PER Poloff  ] on May 26 that the recent spate of media attention on [LOC Pakistan  ] 's nuclear security has led the [MISC GOP  ] to delay an important nonproliferation effort , the removal of [MISC U.S.-origin  ] highly-enriched uranium spent fuel from a [MISC Pakistani  ] nuclear research reactor . 
The [MISC GOP  ] agreed in principle to the fuel removal in 2007 , but has been slow in scheduling a visit by [LOC U.S.  ] technical experts to discuss logistical and other issues . 
In recent months , the [ORG Strategic Plans Division and Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] both indicated progress on the matter and a proposed visit for late May was under review . 
However , according to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , a recent [MISC GOP  ] interagency review of the program concluded that the " sensational " international and local media coverage of the security of [LOC Pakistan  ] 's nuclear weapons made it impossible to proceed at this time . 
If the local media got word of the fuel removal , " they certainly would portray it as the [LOC United States  ] taking [LOC Pakistan  ] 's nuclear weapons , " he argued . 
The visit will have to be delayed for 3-4 months or until the political climate makes it more conducive to hosting a [LOC U.S.  ] visit , he stated. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) Comment: As noted in previous post reporting , the [MISC GOP  ] is extremely sensitive to media focus on [LOC Pakistan  ] 's nuclear program . 
In a sign of their growing defensiveness , the [ORG Foreign Office  ] Spokesman took significant time out of his May 21 press conference to address nuclear security , stating categorically , " there is simply no question of our strategic assets falling into the wrong hands . 
" To a question about reported offers of [LOC U.S.  ] help with nuclear security , he responded , " we do not need this assistance . 
" With the postponement of the nuclear fuel removal , it is clear that the negative media attention has begun to hamper [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to improve [LOC Pakistan  ] 's nuclear security and nonproliferation practices .
