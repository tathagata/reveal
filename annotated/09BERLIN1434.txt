REASONS: 1.4 ( B ) AND ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY . 
MFA State Minister [PER Werner Hoyer  ] strongly defended the new government 's commitment to seek the withdrawal of all remaining nuclear weapons from [LOC Germany  ] during a November 10 meeting with [ORG EUR A/S  ] [PER Phil Gordon  ] and Ambassador [PER Murphy  ] , arguing that there was not one credible scenario in which tactical nuclear weapons could be usefully deployed . 
He emphasized the seriousness of the commitment by noting that it would be one of the benchmarks by which the government would ultimately be judged . 
[PER Hoyer  ] said equivalent efforts should be made on conventional arms control and to that end , called for more creativity in bringing the [MISC Russians  ] back on board with [ORG CFE  ] . 
[PER Hoyer  ] expected that [LOC Germany  ] would increase its contributions to [LOC Afghanistan  ] after the upcoming international conference , but said it was too soon to talk about numbers . 
He claimed the [MISC Dutch  ] may take on new responsibilities in the north after withdrawing from [LOC Uruzgan  ] . 
Given the strong leftward shift of the [ORG Social Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG SPD  ] ) , [PER Hoyer  ] thought it was unlikely that former [PER FM Steinmeier  ] would stay on much longer as parliamentary caucus chairman . 
END SUMMARY . 
TACTICAL NUKES <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Gordon  ] noted that up to now , [PER FM Westerwelle  ] had said all the right things about needing to go to [ORG NATO  ] to address the proposal for the withdrawal of all remaining nuclear weapons from [LOC Germany  ] . 
However , it was not clear whether [LOC Germany  ] had thought through all the broader ramifications of its proposal . 
[PER Gordon  ] noted that the withdrawal could lead some to conclude that the [LOC U.S.  ] was un-committing from [LOC Europe  ] and further undermine confidence in [ORG Article  ] 5 among newer [ORG NATO  ] members . 
Withdrawal from [LOC Germany  ] would also put other host nations in a politically difficult position , especially those like [LOC Turkey  ] , who favored keeping the weapons . 
Once this becomes a public debate , no government may be able to withstand the pressure to have the weapons withdrawn. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Hoyer  ] responded that during the coalition negotiations , defenders of the status quo could not come up with one credible scenario in which tactical nuclear weapons could be usefully deployed . 
Therefore , he argued , the supposed deterrence of these weapons was meaningless . 
[PER Hoyer  ] insisted that he took [ORG Article  ] 5 seriously , but thought there were better , more credible ways of providing the required deterrence . 
He admitted , however , that the [MISC Baltic  ] air policing mission , for example , and other initiatives like it , had proven insufficient for the newer [MISC Allies  ] . 
He acknowledged the large stockpile of [MISC Russian  ] tactical nuclear weapons , calling them pure nonsense , but did not condition withdrawal of tactical nuclear weapons from [LOC Germany  ] with reciprocal cuts by [LOC Russia  ] . 
[PER Hoyer  ] said the commitment to seek the withdrawal of nuclear weapons was one of the top 10 to 15 benchmarks by which the new government would ultimately be measured . 
Therefore , its importance should not be underestimated . 
[ORG CFE  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Hoyer  ] thought it was important to balance nuclear arms control with continued efforts on the conventional side to avoid giving the impression that the build-up of conventional armaments was less important . 
He called for more creativity in finding a way out of the deadlock over the [ORG CFE Treaty  ] . 
Toward that end , the MFA favored new initiatives that would force the [MISC Russians  ] to respond and not allow them to continue to blame [ORG NATO  ] for the impasse . 
[PER Gordon  ] pointed out that even if one were to take the [LOC Georgia  ] issue off the table , the continued [MISC Russian  ] demand for abolishing flank limits is unacceptable to many [MISC Allies  ] and probably could not pass muster in [ORG Congress  ] . 
[MISC EUROPEAN  ] SECURITY TREATY AND [ORG OSCE SUMMIT  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Hoyer  ] said that in addressing the [MISC Medvedev  ] proposal , it is was important to stick to current [MISC European  ] security structures , noting that without the [ORG Helsinki Process  ] , the previous night 's celebration of the fall of the [LOC Berlin  ] Wall would have never been possible . 
While open to possible reforms of the [ORG OSCE  ] , [PER Hoyer  ] shared [LOC U.S.  ] skepticism about the need for a new treaty . 
He also agreed that an [MISC OSCE Summit  ] hosted by [LOC Kazakhstan  ] was hard to justify , given [LOC Kazakhstan  ] 's human rights record and the lack of substance to discuss . 
[LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Asked what the prospects were of [LOC Germany  ] doing more in [LOC BERLIN  ] 00001434 002 OF 002 [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Hoyer  ] said he agreed with the [LOC U.S.  ] approach that it was important to first define the objective and then figure out the strategy before deciding on resources . 
In this regard , [LOC Germany  ] viewed the upcoming conference as key for establishing the necessary basis for the international community 's continued engagement in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Hoyer  ] said he expected that [LOC Germany  ] would probably end up having to do some topping up in all fields , military as well as civilian , but it was too soon to talk about specific numbers yet . 
Based on a recent visit to the [LOC Netherlands  ] , [PER Hoyer  ] was hopeful of getting the [MISC Dutch  ] involved in the north of [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
He said they felt bad about their upcoming exit from [LOC Uruzgan  ] in the south and seemed eager to do something to compensate for that . 
GRIM FUTURE FOR [PER STEINMEIER  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Hoyer  ] said that now that the [ORG Social Democrats  ] are in opposition , they would forget extremely quickly what positions they used to support and move to the left . 
As a result , he thought it was unlikely that former [PER FM Steinmeier  ] would survive very long as the new chair of the [ORG SPD  ] parliamentary caucus . 
The new designated party chairman and secretary general have completely disassociated themselves from the old [ORG SPD  ] leadership and its policies . 
[PER Hoyer  ] said that if the new leadership stayed on its current course , [PER Steinmeier  ] , who was the [ORG SPD  ] policy mastermind over the past 10 years , could only stay on by repudiating almost everything he had stood for .
