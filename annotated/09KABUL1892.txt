Eikenberry  ] for Reasons 1:4 b , d <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) SUMMARY . 
President [PER Karzai  ] and I continued our dialogue on the future of [MISC U.S.-Afghan  ] relations ( reftel ) in our weekly meeting , July 7 . 
We were joined [ORG by National Security Advisor Rassoul  ] . 
[PER Karzai  ] discussed his priorities for the next five years as outlined in his draft election manifesto . 
The President 's manner was significantly more relaxed and warm than in meetings the previous week when he was often agitated , accusing the [LOC U.S.  ] of working against him ( reftel ) . 
As a result , our discussion was more constructive and forward-looking . 
When [PER Karzai  ] drifted towards a reiteration of his anti-U.S. conspiracy theories on several occasions , I was able to refocus the conversation on how the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] governments can work together in the near and medium term to achieve combined success . 
REVIEWING KARZAI'S ELECTION MANIFESTO FOR NEXT FIVE YEARS --------------------------------------------- ------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) As we discussed the long-term goals outlined in [PER Karzai  ] 's draft election manifesto , I reiterated the [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to continuing our close partnership with [LOC Afghanistan  ] , regardless of whom the [MISC Afghan  ] people elect in August . 
I then outlined what the [LOC U.S.  ] was seeking from the relationship over the next five years and commented on some points in [PER Karzai  ] 's proposed agenda . 
Under President [PER Obama  ] 's strategy for [LOC Afghanistan  ] , I noted , we would continue to pursue a more coherent regional approach , while assisting the [MISC Afghan  ] government build a more secure and economically sustainable country that would never again permit sanctuary for international terrorism . 
I emphasized the importance of achieving meaningful progress in the near term to prove to the [LOC U.S.  ] and the international community that our ongoing investment of lives and resources in [LOC Afghanistan  ] was producing tangible , lasting results for the [MISC Afghan  ] people. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) I took issue with the foreign policy section of [PER Karzai  ] 's draft manifesto which stressed [LOC Afghanistan  ] 's relations with the [MISC Islamic  ] world and with [LOC Palestine  ] , followed by a rather weak comment on relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] I pointed out this did not accurately reflect our robust partnership and raises questions regarding [PER Karzai  ] 's perspective on the bilateral relationship. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) I also noted the document 's lack of a strong emphasis on strengthening [ORG Afghan National Security Forces  ] ( [ORG ANSF  ] ) and judicial system . 
Five years down the road , I said , success would be defined by whether the [ORG ANSF  ] 's increased capacity allowed it to take the lead in planning and conducting effective military operations , as well as apprehending and detaining insurgents under [MISC Afghan  ] legal authority . 
( NOTE: We are seeking a translation of the draft of [PER Karzai  ] 's manifesto passed to us earlier this month and will transmit septel once translation is complete . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Karzai  ] then mentioned that after the election he planned to call a national jirga to make a recommitment to the [MISC Afghanistan-U.S.  ] relationship and our partnership in the war against terror . 
This would , he claimed , clarify the military assistance aspect of the relationship and counter what many [MISC Afghan  ] 's perceive to be the " unfocused presence " of international forces , reducing public concerns about those forces . 
( Note: We have since learned that a later draft of [PER Karzai  ] 's manifesto may include this call for a traditional loya jirga to address the presence of [LOC U.S.  ] forces in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
If true that [PER Karzai  ] intends to convene a traditional loya jirga instead of a constitutional loya jirga , it would reflect a disappointing continuation of [PER Karzai  ] 's tendency to govern through reliance on personalities of the past , rather than on democratic institutions . 
) AMBASSADOR: FOCUS SHOULD BE ON [MISC AFGHAN  ] GOVT WINNING HEARTS AND MINDS --------------------------------------------- -------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Karzai  ] then returned to a familiar theme , his wish for [MISC Afghan-U.S.  ] relations to recover the spirit of 2002-04 - a period [PER Karzai  ] sees as a " golden age " in the relationship . 
He would like for [LOC U.S.  ] forces to again be able to drive their humvees through villages , greeted warmly by villagers who would shout , " Good morning , [PER Sergeant Thompson  ] . 
" [PER Karzai  ] claimed , as he has many times , that his concern over the erosion of public trust in the [LOC U.S.  ] was a driving factor in his increasingly strident criticism regarding civilian casualties , night raids and detentions. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) I reminded [PER Karzai  ] that we had agreed our discussion would be forward-looking , rather than dwell on past grievances . 
I also reminded him the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC ISAF  ] had made a [LOC KABUL  ] 00001892 002 OF 003 tremendous effort over the past year to avoid civilian casualties , noting that in a recent engagement in [LOC Helmand  ] where one [LOC U.S.  ] marine had been killed and 25 wounded , we had not employed close air support or artillery . 
[PER Karzai  ] agreed there had been a dramatic reduction in civilian casualty incidents , saying he intended to make a public statement noting his gratitude for [LOC U.S.  ] efforts . 
I welcomed such a statement , observing that the [LOC U.S.  ] continues to bear a heavy cost for our assistance to [LOC Afghanistan  ] in the [MISC American  ] lives lost as we work to ensure a more secure future here. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) I also took issue with [PER Karzai  ] 's " golden age " perspective , reminding him that I had been in [LOC Afghanistan  ] during this period . 
It was clear , even at that time , that trouble was brewing as the focus on security and reconstruction drifted and declined due to lack of resources and a comprehensive strategy . 
I urged [PER Karzai  ] to recognize that President [PER Obama  ] is providing the [MISC U.S.-Afghan  ] partnership with the tools necessary to build a lasting foundation for [LOC Afghanistan  ] 's success , based on sustainable security , accountable government , and a working economy . 
I stressed to [PER Karzai  ] that our primary goal in [LOC Afghanistan  ] is not to win public support for the [LOC U.S.  ] , but rather to help the [MISC Afghan  ] government win its own people 's hearts and minds by enabling it to provide basic security and effective governance to the people . 
In five years , we expect to still have forces in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , but with the majority as advisors and trainers in support of [ORG ANSF  ] in areas such as logistics , air support , intelligence , etc . 
Returning to [PER Karzai  ] 's hopes for the future , I told him [MISC Americans  ] do not long for a day in which their soldiers are hailed throughout [LOC Afghanistan  ] ; they are instead growing impatient for the day a respected [MISC Afghan  ] Army and national police force are fully capable of providing security to the [MISC Afghan  ] populace . 
Time is not unlimited . 
[PER KARZAI'S ANTI-U.S  ] . 
RHETORIC UNDERMINES ADVOCACY FOR CONTINUED SUPPORT --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( N/SF ) I then raised with [PER Karzai  ] his regular claim to senior [LOC U.S.  ] visitors that the [LOC U.S.  ] has " failed in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
" I noted that such rhetoric could potentially undermine continued bipartisan support for our current strategy of expanding [LOC U.S.  ] assistance to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
I said some criticism was fair , but in these meetings with senior [LOC U.S.  ] officials , [PER Karzai  ] regularly failed to acknowledge any meaningful progress resulting from [LOC U.S.  ] contributions . 
By condemning [LOC U.S.  ] efforts while failing to take any responsibility for [LOC Afghanistan  ] 's problems , [PER Karzai  ] was not presenting the [MISC Afghan  ] government ( or himself ) as a responsible partner in this relationship , a partner cognizant of and sensitive to mutual obligations . 
Leaving meetings with [PER Karzai  ] , officials could easily conclude that the [LOC U.S.  ] has accomplished little or nothing here and question why we continue to devote [MISC American  ] lives and resources to the effort . 
[PER Karzai  ] indicated that he understood the need to present a more balanced perspective . 
( Note . 
It remains to be seen whether [PER Karzai  ] can or will refrain from this " blame [LOC America  ] " tactic he uses to deflect criticism of his administration . 
Indeed , his inability to grasp the most rudimentary principles of state-building and his deep seated insecurity as a leader combine to make any admission of fault unlikely , in turn confounding our best efforts to find in [PER Karzai  ] a responsible partner . 
) ELECTIONS: [PER KARZAI  ] ( STILL ) SUSPICIOUS OF [LOC U.S.  ] INTENTIONS --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Revisiting a favorite grievance , [PER Karzai  ] asserted that early in the year some officials in the [ORG Obama Administration  ] had encouraged potential opposition candidates to run . 
[PER Karzai  ] indicated he felt Secretary [PER Clinton  ] had been very supportive and noted relations with VP [PER Biden  ] were much improved . 
He still felt some senior officials were actively working to undermine him . 
Those officials , he said , were openly discussing election runoff scenarios that would give the opposition an opening to unite against him . 
[PER Karzai  ] claimed that in a fair and free election he would win on the first round . 
If there were " irregularities " and the election went to a second round , [PER Karzai  ] believed opposition candidates would play the " ethnic card " to marshal support , undermining national unity. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) I challenged his assertion that [ORG Administration  ] officials had promoted opposition candidates . 
I emphasized that , in fact , our Mission has gone to great pains to remain balanced in engagement with presidential candidates and to promote a level-playing field , I reminded [PER Karzai  ] that I had decided not to visit [LOC Mazar-e-Sharif  ] because of Governor [PER Atta  ] 's overt campaigning for [PER Abdullah  ] and his reported refusal to comply with [LOC MOI Atmar  ] 's dismissal of two policemen in the province for corruption . 
[PER Karzai  ] replied , with humor , [LOC KABUL  ] 00001892 003 OF 003 that he conceded in this instance that the [LOC U.S.  ] had been even-handed in demonstrating its commitment to fair elections . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Although more relaxed than in recent meetings , [PER Karzai  ] remains deeply suspicious of [LOC U.S.  ] intentions and actions regarding key opposition candidates , frequently citing [MISC U.S.-based  ] support groups for [PER Abdullah Abdullah  ] and [PER Ashraf Ghani  ] . 
[PER Karzai  ] is currently most concerned about a potential [PER Abdullah  ] coalition . 
( He dismissed [PER Ghani  ] , saying that he will know [PER Ghani  ] has admitted defeat when he asks for a position in [PER Karzai  ] 's new government . 
) [PER Karzai  ] clearly expected ( or hoped ) to receive the same [LOC U.S.  ] support for his candidacy that he received in the 2004 election , and interprets our neutral stance in this election as evidence that the [LOC U.S.  ] is " against " him . 
I will continue to use my weekly dialogues with [PER Karzai  ] to clarify our position on this and other issues , while focusing him on the way forward in [MISC U.S.-Afghan  ] relations with an emphasis on our shared desire that progress needs to continue , regardless of who wins the election . 
In future discussions , I will continue to stress the importance of [LOC Afghanistan  ] assuming a more meaningful partnership role , and focus on key issue areas such as [ORG ANSF  ] growth and assumption of lead responsibility for security , reconciliation , government accountability , and sustainable development . 
Through this engagement , we will also seek to avoid the gap between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [PER Karzai  ] widening to the point that we will lose precious time closing the distance should he be re-elected .
