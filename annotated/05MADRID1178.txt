B ) HALL - MANZANARES E-MAIL OF 3/23 Classified By: Charge d'Affaires [PER Bob Manzanares  ] ; reasons 1.4 ( B ) and ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( SBU ) Charge conveyed [MISC Ref A  ] points to [ORG National Security Adviser  ] [PER Carles Casajuana  ] on March 23 . 
[PER Casajuana  ] stressed the correlation of [MISC USG-Spanish  ] interests in a stable , democratic [LOC Venezuela  ] and assured Charge that the [ORG USG  ] points would be provided to President [PER Zapatero  ] and his party prior to [PER Zapatero  ] 's departure for the region on March 28. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) The largest-ciruclation [MISC Spanish  ] dailies , " [ORG El Pais  ] " and " [ORG El Mundo  ] " , provided extensive front page coverage of " [LOC U.S.  ] concern " regarding the [MISC Spanish  ] weapons sale to [LOC Venezuela  ] and President [PER Zapatero  ] 's overtures to [PER Chavez  ] . 
These press stories indicate that [LOC Spain  ] made a final decision on March 27 on the weapons package it would offer [LOC Venezuela  ] , which will include: - 4 coastal patrol boats - 4 ocean going corvettes - 2 oil tankers - 1 - 10 C-295 transport aircraft - 2 coastal patrol aircraft The total value of the sale is estimated at [MISC Euros  ] 1.3 billion ( [MISC USDOLS  ] 1.69 billion ) and will reportedly provide 600 jobs for 6 years at [LOC Spain  ] 's hard-pressed [ORG Navantia  ] shipyards . 
Separately , [MISC Spanish  ] oil giant [ORG Repsol-YPF  ] and [ORG Petroleos de Venezuela  ] were expected to conclude a cooperation agreement during [PER Zapatero  ] 's visit , which could include up to [MISC USDOLS  ] 185 million in investments in [LOC Venezuela  ] by [ORG Repsol.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) " [ORG El Pais  ] , " which has close ties to the ruling [ORG Socialist Party  ] , cited unnamed sources who asserted that the [ORG MFA  ] had strongly opposed the weapons sale to [LOC Venezuela  ] because it would undermine [MISC Spanish  ] relations with [LOC Colombia  ] and the [ORG USG  ] . 
The press story cast the four-leader format of the summit as an effort by the [ORG MFA  ] to mollify the [ORG USG  ] by ensuring Uribe 's inclusion in the most high-profile element of the [PER Zapatero  ] visit . 
This tracks with numerous private conversations with [ORG MFA  ] contacts at various levels , including Deputy FM [PER Bernardino Leon  ] , who were clearly uncomfortable with the nature of the weapons sale to [LOC Venezuela  ] and insisted that Defense Minister [PER Jose Bono  ] pushed the deal through despite the [ORG MFA  ] 's strong opposition . 
The [ORG MFA  ] is now in spin control mode , minimizing the potential offensive capability of the weapons package ( describing the corvettes as " patrol boats " for example ) and working hard to protect the [ORG GOS  ] from [ORG USG  ] and opposition criticism. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) With [MISC Ref A  ] demarche , we have now raised our concerns regarding [MISC Spanish  ] overtures and weapons sales to [LOC Venezuela  ] in at least eight separate meetings with [ORG GOS  ] officials , including with Deputy FM [PER Leon  ] , Defense Minister [PER Bono  ] , Deputy Defense Minister [PER Pardo  ] , and [ORG CHOD Sans  ] . 
More importantly , Attorney General [PER Gonzalez  ] raised [LOC Venezuela  ] as a key source of bilateral friction during his March 10 meetings with Vice President [PER Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega  ] and FM [MISC Moratinos  ] . 
Given the magnitude of the sale , we did not expect to derail the ship deal , but the [ORG USG  ] 's constant pressure on this issue does make clear that the weapons sale will remain a drag on efforts to improve bilateral relations .
