( C ) SUMMARY: President [PER Sarkozy  ] 's March 26-27 visits to the [LOC Democratic Republic of Congo  ] ( [ORG DRC  ] ) , [LOC Republic  ] of [LOC Congo  ] ( [ORG ROC  ] ) , and [LOC Niger  ] were intended to promote democratic principles , shared business interests , and , more generally , [PER Sarkozy  ] 's policy of moving away from the " [MISC France-Afrique  ] " model of managing relations to a more modern one based on partnership , according to [LOC Presidential Deputy Diplomatic Advisor Bruno  ] [PER Joubert  ] on April 3 . 
[PER Joubert  ] said that [PER Sarkozy  ] had accomplished what he had set out to do and that the [MISC Africans  ] with whom he met better understood [MISC French  ] policy toward the region and where [PER Sarkozy  ] wants to take relations , even if they were not completely comfortable with the new paradigm . 
On the [ORG DRC  ] and [LOC Rwanda  ] , [PER Joubert  ] explained that [LOC France  ] wanted to promote cooperation between the two and suggested starting with a number of small economic and development projects that would show quick results and encourage further cooperation . 
[PER Joubert  ] said that he planned to travel to the [LOC U.S.  ] during the April 14-15 period and hoped to meet with officials at the [ORG Department ( AF A/S-Designate Carson  ] ) , [ORG NSC  ] ( [ORG AF Senior  ] Director [PER Gavin )  ] , and [ORG USUN  ] ( [PER PermRep Rice  ] ) . 
END SUMMARY . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX [MISC France-Afrique  ] -------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Rather than provide a narrative of [PER Sarkozy  ] 's visit , [PER Joubert  ] placed it within the context of [LOC France  ] 's evolving [LOC Africa  ] policy and its movement , under [PER Sarkozy  ] , away from the classic colonial and post-colonial " [MISC France-Afrique  ] " model and towards a more modern relationship based on shared interests and a partnership among equals ( ref [MISC E-G  ] ) . 
He said that the visit , most notably as expressed in [PER Sarkozy  ] 's speech before the [ORG DRC  ] parliament , was an extension of remarks that [PER Sarkozy  ] had made in [LOC Cape Town  ] in February 2008 on the need for rational relationships free of the baggage of the past . 
[PER Joubert  ] said that the new policy faced several challenges , one of which he described as a predilection on the part of the [MISC French  ] public and press to view relations with [LOC Africa  ] as inherently " corrupt , sordid , and scandal-ridden . 
" The public and press often looked at [LOC Africa  ] only from this angle . 
One of [PER Sarkozy  ] 's aims was to carry out a visit crisply , efficiently , and transparently . 
He wanted to show that [LOC France  ] could deal with its [MISC African  ] partners as straightforwardly as it dealt with its other partners , and [PER Joubert  ] deemed this aspect of the visit a success , even if its briskness and openness left the press , critics , and some [MISC Africans  ] a bit perplexed. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Always seeking to put a negative light on relations , some observers , while claiming to condemn " [MISC France-Afrique  ] , " at the same time accused [PER Sarkozy  ] of trying to " rupture " [MISC French  ] relations with [LOC Africa  ] . 
[PER Joubert  ] said that neither [PER Sarkozy  ] nor anyone else speaking officially for [LOC France  ] had ever used the term " rupture . 
" The move away from " [MISC France-Afrique  ] " was instead a " turning of a page " and a shift in direction towards a more modern and balanced relationship. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Thus partnership was an underlying theme of the [LOC PARIS  ] 00000504 002 OF 002 visit . 
In [LOC Niger  ] , for example , where [MISC French  ] extractive-industry giant [ORG AREVA  ] and its activities were a central element of the visit , [PER Sarkozy  ] stressed not only the mutual benefits derived from [ORG AREVA  ] 's uranium operations but also the other positive aspects of [ORG AREVA  ] 's presence in terms of improved roads and infrastructure for the common good . 
The same was true for [ORG AREVA  ] 's activities in the [LOC DRC.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Another theme was democracy and good governance , with [PER Joubert  ] noting that [LOC France  ] was unfairly accused of only supporting " old regimes . 
" [PER Sarkozy  ] 's speeches in the [ORG DRC  ] and [ORG ROC  ] stressed the need for both countries to adhere to democratic principles and that these principles were not something applicable only in the [LOC West  ] . 
[PER Joubert  ] said that [PER Sarkozy  ] 's stop in [ORG Brazzaville  ] had to be managed " delicately . 
" As also noted ref C , [PER Sarkozy  ] did not want to appear to be campaigning for President [PER Sassou Nguesso  ] regarding elections later in 2009 , and [PER Joubert  ] pointed out that [PER Sarkozy  ] met with opposition figures to underscore that point. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Asked how the press and [MISC Africans  ] viewed the visit , [PER Joubert  ] said that the press response was muted , in part because the visit did not take place according to press preconceptions . 
[PER Joubert  ] indicated that this was a positive development insofar as the press was forced to think about the visit . 
[PER Joubert  ] said that [MISC African  ] leaders seemed to understand what [PER Sarkozy  ] 's approach represented in terms of transparent , straightforward dealings , although they may not have been completely comfortable with it . 
Speaking quite candidly , [PER Joubert  ] said that " you have to understand , many of these leaders , such as [PER Sassou Nguesso  ] , have grown up with 'France-Afrique.' 
When they used to meet with [ORG Chirac  ] , it was all backslapping , jokes , long leisurely meals , and plenty of anecdotes about the old days , when they and [ORG Chirac  ] were younger and coming up together . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] isn't like that at all ; it takes some getting used to for some of them . 
There were a few comments about why [PER Sarkozy  ] didn't at least spend the night at each of his stops . 
They are beginning to see that [PER Sarkozy  ] is not here to carry on the old backslapping ways .
