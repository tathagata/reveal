[PER Saleh  ] instead insisted that the [MISC Yemeni  ] detainees be returned to [LOC Yemen  ] as soon as a proposed rehabilitation center in [LOC Aden  ] , funded by the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , is ready to accept them . 
End Summary . 
SALEH INTRANSIGENT ON DETAINEES ------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) President [PER Saleh  ] on March 16 repeatedly rebuffed suggestions by visiting [ORG APDNSA  ] [PER John Brennan  ] that [MISC Yemeni  ] Guantanamo detainees be sent to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , insisting on a [MISC Saudi-style  ] rehabilitation center inside [LOC Yemen  ] , funded by the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
[PER Brennan  ] , accompanied by the Ambassador , [ORG NSC  ] Director [PER John Duncan  ] , S/WCI Ambassador [PER Clint Williamson  ] , and [PER Pol/Mil Chief  ] , told [PER Saleh  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] wanted detainees to return to [LOC Yemen  ] eventually . 
In the absence of a [MISC Yemeni  ] program , however , the best near-term solution was for [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] and [LOC Yemen  ] to jointly run a program , at a [MISC Saudi-built  ] rehabilitation facility at [LOC Abha  ] in [ORG KSA  ] with an immediate capability of receiving up to 120 detainees and open to [MISC Arabs  ] from across the region . 
[PER Saleh  ] refused to address this suggestion directly , saying [LOC Yemen  ] would build its own rehabilitation center in [LOC Aden  ] . 
" We will offer the land in [LOC Aden  ] , and you and the [MISC Saudis  ] will provide the funding . 
" It will be ready 90 days after receipt of the USD 11 million required for construction , [PER Saleh  ] said. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Growing increasingly impatient , [PER Saleh  ] said that the [LOC U.S.  ] could duplicate the [MISC Saudi  ] program in [LOC Yemen  ] . 
[PER Brennan  ] responded that such a program takes time to develop and that [PER Saleh  ] had his hands full dealing with al-Qaeda in [LOC Yemen  ] . 
[PER Saleh  ] said that while he personally had no problem with detainees being sent to [ORG KSA  ] , [MISC Yemeni  ] opposition parties are the real obstacle because they will not allow him to give [ORG KSA  ] control over [MISC Yemeni  ] citizens . 
[PER Brennan  ] told [PER Saleh  ] that a leader of his depth of experience could surely figure out a way to deal with the opposition , s concerns . 
[PER Saleh  ] asked why the [LOC U.S.  ] didn , t simply keep the detainees at [LOC Guantanamo  ] or send them to the " [PER Moayad  ] prison " while [LOC Yemen  ] builds its own facility . 
( [PER Note: Saleh  ] was referring to the federal prison in [LOC Colorado  ] where convicted [MISC Yemeni  ] terrorist financier [PER Mohammed al-Moayad  ] is currently being held . 
End Note . 
) Signaling his bottom line , [PER Saleh  ] told [PER Brennan  ] that [LOC Yemen  ] already had plans for a rehabilitation center and repeated his demand that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG KSA  ] fund it . 
At this point , [PER Brennan  ] asked to speak with [PER Saleh  ] and the Ambassador privately. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In the pull-aside with [PER Brennan  ] and the Ambassador , [PER Saleh  ] said that he wouldn , t object if the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] entered into a bilateral agreement regarding disposition of the [LOC Guantanamo  ] detainees . 
( [PER Comment: Saleh  ] said this knowing full well that the [MISC Saudis  ] are unwilling at this point to take in the [MISC Yemeni  ] detainees without his concurrence . 
End Comment . 
) In a brief meeting outside [PER Saleh  ] 's gazebo , Ambassador [PER Williamson  ] described to [PER Saleh  ] 's nephew , Deputy Director of the [ORG National Security Bureau  ] ( [ORG NSB  ] ) [PER Ammar Saleh  ] , the [ORG USG  ] 's review process for evaluating possible destinations for detainees and praised the [MISC Saudi  ] program . 
Ambassador [PER Williamson  ] said that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] was closer to [LOC Yemen  ] than [LOC Guantanamo  ] and that if the [MISC Saudi  ] solution didn't work , then the [MISC Yemenis  ] would be transfered to other countries , but not to [LOC Yemen  ] . 
[PER Ammar  ] proposed sending the [MISC Yemenis  ] to the [LOC ROYG  ] facility for a brief ( e.g . 
3 month ) period at which time [PER Saleh  ] could announce that they had asked to be transferred to [ORG KSA  ] , and it would be done . 
He cautioned that he had not yet proposed the idea to [PER Saleh  ] and that any such transfers would have to be approved by both the family and the tribes involved . 
Ambassador [PER Williamson  ] thanked [PER Ammar Saleh  ] for his suggestion and said he would take it up with [PER Mr. Brennan  ] , but noted that he did not think it was a viable alternative given the caveats imposed . 
RETURN OF THE [ORG BAATH  ] IN [LOC IRAQ  ] ? ? ----------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In a bizarre postscript to the morning meeting with [PER Saleh  ] , the Palace protocol office called an hour later to request that [PER Brennan  ] meet with [PER Ammar Saleh  ] . 
Expecting a continuation of the [LOC Guantanamo  ] detainee discussion , the [PER Brennan  ] delegation and the Ambassador met with [PER Saleh  ] , who said that he had been instructed by the President to share " very important " intelligence information with [PER Brennan  ] . 
[PER Ammar  ] said the [ORG NSB  ] had what it considered reliable information that the [MISC Iraqi  ] Baath party was reconstituting itself and would reclaim power in [LOC Baghdad  ] once the [LOC U.S.  ] pulled out . 
Upon hearing this , [PER Brennan  ] ended the meeting , telling [PER Ammar  ] that he had come expecting to discuss detainee issues , and that he would report to President [PER Obama  ] his disappointment that the [LOC ROYG  ] was being inflexible in dealing with the issue . 
In a final twist , the protocol office called to say that [PER Ammar Saleh  ] would meet [PER Mr. Brennan  ] at the airport as he departed [LOC Yemen  ] ( raising again the possibility that there could be further discussion of the detainee issue ) only to call back to say [PER Ammar Saleh  ] had been called away to another meeting . 
ROYG SPIN AND EMBASSY PRESS STATEMENT ------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Official news agency [ORG Saba  ] released a statement after the meeting saying that [PER Saleh  ] had called on the [LOC U.S.  ] to " extradite " [MISC Yemeni  ] citizens at [LOC Guantanamo  ] to [LOC Yemen  ] so they could be rehabilitated and integrated into society . 
The [ORG Saba  ] statement also noted that [PER Brennan  ] had delivered a letter from President [PER Obama  ] praising [LOC Yemen  ] 's efforts in counterterrorism and that [PER Saleh  ] had given [PER Brennan  ] a response letter for President [PER Obama  ] . 
( [PER Note: Brennan  ] did deliver a letter from President [PER Obama  ] , but the letter focused on the danger of transfering detainees directly to [LOC Yemen  ] . 
Contrary to the [ORG Saba  ] statement , [PER Saleh  ] did not give [PER Brennan  ] a letter for President [PER Obama  ] . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) The [ORG Embassy  ] issued the following press release , cleared by [PER Brennan  ] , the afternoon of March 16 . 
Begin [ORG Embassy  ] press release text: [PER John Brennan  ] , Assistant to the President and Deputy [ORG National Security Advisor  ] , visited [LOC Yemen  ] on March 16 , 2009 as part of a visit to the region to discuss continued cooperation between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Yemen  ] in combating terrorism . 
As part of the ongoing dialogue between [LOC Yemen  ] and the [LOC United States  ] regarding the remaining [MISC Yemeni  ] detainees at [LOC Guantanamo  ] , Mr. [PER Brennan  ] raised with President [PER Ali Abdullah Saleh  ] the [ORG U.S. Government  ] 's concerns about the direct return of detainees to [LOC Yemen  ] . 
End [ORG Embassy  ] press release text . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) To say [PER Saleh  ] missed a good chance to engage the new [ORG Administration  ] on one of its key foreign policy priorities would be a severe understatement . 
He appeared alternately dismissive , bored , and impatient during the 40-minute meeting . 
[PER Saleh  ] 's knowledge that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] will not accept [MISC Yemeni  ] detainees without at least tacit support from [PER Saleh  ] has likely emboldened the [LOC ROYG  ] to press publicly and privately for an all-or-nothing push for the direct transfer of detainees to [LOC Yemen  ] . 
[PER Saleh  ] clearly feels that he has the better hand in any negotiations on the issue . 
He may have concluded that , if he holds out long enough , the [ORG USG  ] will eventually acquiesce to his demands because of the [ORG Administration  ] 's timeline for closing [LOC Guantanamo  ] in spite of Mr. [PER Brennan  ] 's clear message that the [ORG USG  ] is actively seeking alternatives . 
End Comment. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) [PER APDNSA Brennan  ] cleared this cable . 
S/WCI Ambassador [PER Williamson  ] did not have the opportunity to clear this cable .
