<code><pre>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 [ORG RPO DUBAI  ] 000177 NOFORN SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 4/22/2019 TAGS PREL , [LOC PGOV  ] , [LOC PHUM  ] , [LOC PINR  ] , [LOC ECON  ] , [LOC ETRD  ] , [LOC KDEM  ] , IR SUBJECT: [LOC IRAN  ] REGIONAL PRESENCE OFFICE--WINDOW ON IRAN--APRIL 22 , 2009 [ORG DUBAI  ] 00000177 001.2 OF 003 CLASSIFIED BY: [PER Timothy Richardson  ] , Acting Director , [LOC Iran  ] Regional Presence Office , [ORG Department of State  ] . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Game of Attrition . 
Ahmadinejad’s defeats on the budget and his plan to distribute cash payments to lower-income [MISC Iranians  ] show that power centers , such as the [ORG Majles  ] , are actively working to pressure the President prior to the June election , according to [ Source removed ] . 
These power centers are also stepping up their lobbying of Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] to get his backing to stall or overturn some Presidential authorities . 
This game is increasingly being played out in the media , where the sides openly attack each other , and where the [MISC President’s  ] public defenses are weakening his hand and depleting political capital that he would prefer to save for the bigger fights ahead . 
The cash payment plan could have garnered AN additional votes , but he continues to “work the rounds” in the provinces and maintain his base of support where it really matters . 
By June , the current policy debates will matter less , and it is too early to consider these moves decisive to AN’s electoral prospects , according to the economist . 
Comment: If these power centers can get increased backing from [PER Khamenei  ] , we may see some interesting fireworks in [MISC Iranian  ] press in the coming weeks . 
As [MISC IRPO  ] has previously reported , identifying the power centers responsible for AN’ setbacks on economic policy last month is difficult but could include a broad spectrum of political factions. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ Name removed ] said the [ORG MOIS  ] will sometimes help assemble charges against defendants , direct cases to particular judges , and order judges to rule a particular way . 
Structurally , he said the [ORG Revolutionary Courts  ] are similar to other courts , fall under the Judiciary’s authority , and are theoretically supposed to follow the same law . 
Defendants are allowed to have lawyers during their trials , can defend themselves , and can appeal decisions . 
Asked about [PER Roxanna Saberi  ] , [ Name removed ] said he was aware of her case , but had no specific information on it . 
Comment: The [ORG Revolutionary Courts’  ] lack of transparency and seemingly baseless decision making make [ Name removed ] allegations plausible and perhaps probable . 
[ Name removed ] work in the judiciary branch as a public prosecutor [ Location removed ] also gives his assertions some credibility , but he did not work in the [ORG Revolutionary Courts  ] . 
His accusations are more likely to reflect the legal community’s assumptions rather than first-hand knowledge of [ORG MOIS  ] influence . 
[ Name removed ] was also notable for the depth of his anti-regime sentiment , which probably colors his impressions of the [ORG Revolutionary Courts.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Mousavi’s Economic Program  ] . 
Moderate presidential candidate [ORG Mir Hussein Mousavi  ] announced his economic program to the [MISC Iranian  ] press this week , emphasizing economic growth and job creation from a rejuvenated and expanded private sector . 
[ORG Mousavi  ] criticized AN’s halting steps at privatization , calling them “the institutionalization of non-productive government management.” Stability in government policies and a strict adherence to the planning documents of a restored Management and [ORG Planning Organization  ] ( [ORG MPO  ] ) and the “rule of law , ” are other key planks . 
The best talking point in the plan , “social justice doesn’t mean equal distribution of poverty , ” challenges AN’s key economic goal by inserting economic growth into the equation and highlighting his poor economic management . 
[ORG Mousavi’s  ] plan only briefly mentions subsidy reforms , stressing the need to implement them gradually , after careful preparation . 
Comment: [ORG Mousavi’s  ] plan mentions [ORG Article  ] 44 of [MISC Iran’s  ] constitution , which defines the role of the state , cooperative , and private sectors in [MISC Iran’s  ] economy , but his emphasis on a strong private sector may open the plan to criticism that it is in conflict with the constitution . 
[ORG Mousavi  ] also threatens to withdraw [MISC Iran’s Fifth Five Year Development  ] Plan , currently being drafted , if AN submits it to the [ORG Majles  ] before the election . 
An [MISC IRPO  ] contact [ Source removed ] , didn’t expect the plan to be finished until later this year. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ Name removed ] said [ORG Iran’s Ministry of Commerce  ] has approved the creation of an [ORG Iran-Americas Chamber of Commerce  ] in anticipation of improved [MISC US-Iran  ] ties . 
Although the chamber’s primary focus is the [LOC US  ] , due to political sensitivities , it will not be called an Iran-US chamber . 
[ Name removed ] made the following points: -- [PER Khamenei  ] instructed [PER Ahmadinejad  ] to base the [MISC Fifth Five Year Development  ] Plan on a draft from the [ORG Expediency Council  ] . 
[PER Hosseini  ] alleged that both the [ORG Expediency Council  ] and the president submitted drafts of the plan to [PER Khamenei  ] and [PER Khamenei  ] favored the [ORG Expediency Council’s  ] version . 
-- The current year will be positive for [MISC Iranian  ] businesses . 
[PER Hosseini  ] , admittedly in contrast with many of his colleagues , is optimistic because the election allows [LOC Iran  ] the opportunity to remove [PER Ahmadinejad  ] and because he believes economic ties with the [LOC US  ] will be a positive shock to the [MISC Iranian  ] economy . 
-- [PER Khamenei  ] moderated his support for [PER Ahmadinejad  ] following Khatami’s decision to exit the contest . 
[PER Hosseini  ] predicts [ORG Mir Hossein Mousavi  ] will win the election . 
-- The [ORG TCC  ] meetings are more productive than the [MISC ICCIM  ] meetings . 
The [ORG TCC  ] has a monthly meeting with government representatives , including ministers ; the [ORG TCC  ] members prepare for the meetings and , typically , complain a great deal during the meetings about government policy . 
Although the government is not always responsive to their complaints , following a recent meeting , the oil minister appointed a committee to resolve the TCC’s concerns . 
Participants in [MISC ICCIM  ] meetings , which include representatives from the provincial chambers , are typically unprepared. --Iranians seeking an export license must be a member of a chamber of commerce and both the [ORG Ministry of Commerce  ] and a chamber must approve the export license . 
Comment: [ Name removed ] seems well placed to comment on economic and political developments in [LOC Iran  ] . 
However , his assertion that the [ORG Expediency Council  ] submitted a draft of the next [MISC Five Year Development  ] plan is unusual because normally the president’s office drafts the plan and submits it to the [ORG Majles  ] . 
The early involvement of the [ORG Expediency Council  ] may reflect Rafsanjani’s concern over Ahmadinejad’s economic policies . 
[PER Khamenei  ] in a letter to [PER Ahmadinejad  ] in January outlined the general policies to be included in the plan ; it is possible the letter is based on a plan from the [ORG Expediency Council.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG IRIG  ] Suspicion Extends to Its Own Official Delegations: [ Source removed ] hinted to [MISC IRPO  ] local staff that official [MISC Iranian  ] delegations can be scrutinized as much as exchange groups headed to the [LOC US  ] . 
[ Name removed ] implied that [ORG IRIG  ] officials had carefully vetted members of the [ORG IMF  ] delegation . 
Separately , he told conoff , sotto voce , that the [ORG IRIG  ] had only decided to allow some delegation members to travel two weeks ago , although their visa applications had been ready much earlier , and that was why they were late in applying . 
Comment: The delay in submitting the [LOC DUBAI  ] 00000177 003.2 OF 003 visa applications may have been simple bureaucratic inefficiency , although [ Name removed ] indicated he strongly believed that security agencies were scrutinizing members of the delegation before permitting them to travel .
