Spogli  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . 
SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C/NF ) After a very strong first month in office , PM [PER Berlusconi  ] 's political honeymoon has been upset by prosecutors accelerating proceedings in criminal cases pending against him . 
These proceedings , leaked wiretaps , as well as the probability of further leaks have [PER Berlusconi  ] insiders concerned . 
The political furor over legislative proposals to block these investigations has distracted the public and [LOC Italy  ] 's politicians from progress on needed reforms but has not reduced [PER Berlusconi  ] 's popularity , according to recent opinion polls . 
The strong prospect that legislation will be approved granting [PER Berlusconi  ] criminal immunity by the end of July may reduce his legal risks , but his political standing and ability to accomplish his national agenda could suffer setbacks . 
END SUMMARY . 
A SURPRISE CHANGE IN THE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA ------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) Soon after his May 8 swearing in , PM [PER Berlusconi  ] started delivering on campaign promises to reduce taxes and increase public security , propelling his approval ratings above sixty percent and earning him the grudging support of many opposition voters and even parts of a normally hostile press ( REF A ) . 
On June 17 , [PER Berlusconi  ] attached an amendment to a security decree pending in the [ORG Senate  ] that would freeze trials on " lesser crimes " committed before June 30 , 2002 ( REF B ) , a provision that would reportedly suspend at least one case against [PER Berlusconi  ] . 
The press aggressively attacked [PER Berlusconi  ] for attending to his personal affairs ; [ORG Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG PD  ] ) leader [PER Walter Veltroni  ] announced the end of dialogue with [PER Berlusconi  ] ; and several [PER Forza Italia  ] ( [ORG FI  ] ) members of parliament told [MISC Poloff  ] they were confused by [PER Berlusconi  ] 's timing when there was much on the political agenda yet to be accomplished . 
Commentators were ready to declare [PER Berlusconi  ] 's honeymoon over. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) The [ORG Senate  ] ultimately approved the amendment freezing certain criminal cases as well as the underlying decree , passing it the [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] for consideration . 
The self-governing [ORG Superior Council  ] of the [PER Magistracy  ] ( [ORG CSM  ] ) objected , suggesting the provision was unconstitutional . 
President [PER Napolitano  ] gave the [ORG CSM  ] an unusual rebuke by telling them they were speaking out of turn and that pronouncing on constitutionality was the purview of the [ORG Constitutional Court  ] . 
[PER Berlusconi  ] has since introduced a modified version of a 2003 law , known as the " [PER Lodo Schifani  ] , " that would give the top four institutional figures in [LOC Italy  ] , including [PER Berlusconi  ] , criminal immunity for the time they are in office . 
Passage of at least one of these measures is possible by the end of July . 
[PER Berlusconi  ] is also consulting with coalition partners on a bill to restrict the use of telephone intercepts. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) Council of [ORG Ministers Undersecretary  ] [PER Paolo Bonaiuti  ] told [PER Poloff  ] July 1 that discussion of these provisions has diverted the public 's attention from legislative progress on [PER Berlusconi  ] 's domestic agenda . 
However , a poll released July 2 indicates that 51 percent of [MISC Italians  ] would vote for [PER Berlusconi  ] if elections were held now , versus 47 percent who actually voted for him in April . 
45 percent support ( an additional 10 percent are indifferent ) the temporary freeze of less important criminal cases , including those pending against [PER Berlusconi  ] . 
CHANGE CAUSED BY A NEWLY FULL LEGAL CASELOAD -------------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The press reports there are at least three criminal cases pending against the PM . 
The reason for the timing of [PER Berlusconi  ] 's moves became clear when prosecutors announced that [PER Berlusconi  ] could be required to testify eight times in July . 
Simultaneously , audio files of wiretappings of [PER Berlusconi  ] and other politicians were leaked to the press and published on the internet . 
Council of [ORG Ministers Undersecretary  ] [PER Gianni Letta  ] told the Ambassador July 2 that additional embarrassing wiretappings could be released in the next few weeks. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) Though the timing for the hearings was a surprise , the cases against [PER Berlusconi  ] are not new . 
In one case potentially coming to a head in the next few weeks , [PER Berlusconi  ] is accused of offering [MISC British  ] corporate lawyer [PER David Mills  ] a $600,000 bribe to hide potentially [LOC ROME  ] 00000840 002.2 OF 002 incriminating evidence . 
In another trial , [PER Berlusconi  ] is accused of fraud related to film rights for his private TV network , [ORG Mediaset  ] . 
In the case currently receiving the most press due to leaked telephone intercepts , [PER Berlusconi  ] is accused of trading political favors with former state television ( [ORG RAI  ] ) director [PER Agostino Sacca  ] , though much of the evidence surrounds [PER Berlusconi  ] 's recommendations that certain showgirls should get greater airtime . 
( NOTE: [PER Berlusconi  ] would not be required to resign in the event of a criminal conviction , though he would likely come under considerable political pressure to do so . 
Convictions are not considered definitive until they are upheld on two appeals . 
In [LOC Italy  ] , that can take several years . 
END NOTE . 
) ITALY'S JUDICIARY: FOR MANY , A [ORG BROKEN SYSTEM  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) Transcripts of telephone intercepts related to criminal investigations are frequently leaked to the press , resulting in significant embarrassment to those involved and calls for reform of [LOC Italy  ] 's fiercely independent judiciary and of the practice of wiretapping . 
Rarely , if ever , is the source inside the judiciary who leaked the transcript discovered . 
Though [LOC Italy  ] 's judiciary is traditionally considered left-leaning , former PM and FM [PER Massimo D'Alema  ] told the Ambassador last year that the judiciary is the greatest threat to the [MISC Italian  ] state . 
Despite fifteen years of discussions on the need for comprehensive judicial reform , no significant progress has been made . 
[MISC Italians  ] , by and large , consider their judicial system broken , perhaps beyond repair , and have very little confidence that the system actually delivers justice . 
WITH A LONG RECORD OF PURSUING [PER BERLUSCONI  ] ----------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Berlusconi  ] 's legal troubles date back to before his entry into politics , though FM [MISC Frattini  ] recently noted that [PER Berlusconi  ] has never been convicted definitively for anything . 
[PER Berlusconi  ] frequently complains that prosecutors time the announcement of investigations to damage him politically: " justice by the clock . 
" For example , [LOC Milan  ] judges announced they were investigating [PER Berlusconi  ] for accounting fraud on April 26 , 2005 , the day [PER Berlusconi  ] was requesting a parliamentary vote of confidence . 
Only a month earlier and days before local elections , investigators announced they would charge [PER Berlusconi  ] with bribery involving film rights for his media company . 
Though there are several more examples , the most celebrated is the announcement [PER Berlusconi  ] was being investigated for tax fraud on the eve of the 2001 [ORG G8 Summit  ] in [LOC Genoa  ] . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Berlusconi  ] 's legal woes have dogged his fifteen years as a politician , though he has never received a conclusive conviction . 
With even some opposition members decrying the apparently political timing of the magistrates' most recent investigations and supporting judicial reform , it seems that politically motivated investigators may have gone too far . 
More importantly , President [PER Napolitano  ] 's implied support for a bill conferring criminal immunity on , among others , [PER Berlusconi  ] means [PER Berlusconi  ] 's legal problems could soon be laid to rest for the duration of his governing mandate . 
Despite this and buoyant opinion polls , additional revelations over the next month have some of his advisers worried . 
In short , [PER Berlusconi  ] has run into headwinds , and it is unclear if they have shifted back in his favor . 
In the extreme , it is possible to imagine a scenario where [PER Berlusconi  ] could lose considerable popularity and his ability to implement reforms , or even his power to govern . 
END COMMENT .
