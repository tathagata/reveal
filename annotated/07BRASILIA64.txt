REASONS: 1.4 ( B ) ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [MISC French  ] Ambassador to [LOC Brazil  ] [PER Antoine Pouillieute  ] met with Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] on January 9 , 2007 for a surprisingly frank and substantive conversation . 
Key themes from the meeting are reported below . 
[LOC BRAZIL  ] -- THE NEW [MISC FRENCH  ] PRIORITY <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Pouillieute  ] noted that his government has a complicated relationship with [LOC Brazil  ] and had recently decided to make [LOC Brazil  ] [LOC France  ] 's largest and most important embassy in [LOC Latin America  ] . 
His government has upgraded its presence in [LOC Brazil  ] to 110 [MISC French  ] nationals , thereby surpassing the [MISC French  ] contingent in [LOC Mexico  ] . 
Some of [LOC France  ] 's most successful and promising recent endeavors with [LOC Brazil  ] have been in the area of military sales , where [PER Pouillieute  ] said the potential for sale of additional future [MISC French  ] military equipment ( NFI ) is quite good. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Pouillieute  ] commented that the [ORG EU  ] 's efforts in [LOC Brazil  ] are not united and that each [ORG EU Country  ] is pursuing its own aims in [LOC Brazil  ] separately . 
He commented that he had little faith in the [MISC EU-Mercosul  ] free trade negotiations , confirming that they basically boiled down to what will likely be a biofuels deal . 
In addition he speculated that even though [LOC Venezuela  ] is not yet disruptive to [MISC Mercosul  ] , it probably will be in the future and that it is critical to [LOC Brazil  ] for [LOC Venezuela  ] to become a full member . 
FOREIGN POLICY <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Regarding broader [MISC Brazilian  ] foreign policy issues , [LOC France  ] has actually found a way to work within [LOC Brazil  ] 's stated south-south policy focus , using common interests in [LOC Africa  ] as a key foundation . 
That said , [PER Pouillieute  ] admitted that the [MISC French  ] were often frustrated with [MISC Brazil:  ] the [MISC Brazilians  ] had often been duplicitous , pointing out to [MISC African  ] countries that they were natural allies given their common colonial past and reminding these countries that [LOC France  ] had once exploited them . 
The [MISC French  ] Ambassador was incredulous that the [MISC Brazilians  ] could think that such comments would not eventually get back to the [MISC French  ] . 
Another source of frustration for the [MISC French  ] Ambassador is that the [MISC Brazilian  ] foreign ministry ( [ORG MRE  ] ) will often sideline some long-planned official [MISC French  ] VIP visit to instead focus on some competing visit by a minor [MISC African  ] visitor . 
This baffled [LOC Pouillietute.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Changing topics , [PER Pouillieute  ] said that [MISC Brazilian  ] Foreign Minister [PER Celso Amorim  ] apparently has planned extensively for transition in [LOC Cuba  ] , and knew exactly what [LOC Brazil  ] 's role would be in post-Castro scenarios on the island ( NFI ) . 
[PER Pouillieute  ] also offered that there might be room for tripartite cooperation on law enforcement issues . 
( Note: US [ORG LEA  ] 's do not currently engage [MISC French  ] counterparts on local efforts . 
) Finally , he expressed his amazement at the lengths [LOC Brazil  ] was going to try to cultivate [LOC China  ] .
