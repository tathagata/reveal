( C ) As [LOC Serbia  ] seeks to overcome mounting economic difficulties and move forward toward its primary goal of [ORG European Union  ] membership , the government is struggling to strike the right tone in the bilateral relationship with [MISC Russia:  ] President [PER Tadic  ] and his close advisors appear intent on giving the [MISC Russians  ] their due without irritating the [MISC Europeans  ] , while others - including Foreign Minister [PER Jeremic  ] - seem to want to use close ties to [LOC Russia  ] as a “bargaining chip” with [LOC Europe  ] and the [LOC United States  ] ( ref A ) . 
A planned visit by [MISC Russian  ] President [PER Dmitriy Medvedev  ] in October is already drawing additional attention to a bilateral relationship where warm , friendly rhetoric is often not matched by concrete , mutually-beneficial cooperation in the political , economic , or security realms . 
End Summary . 
October [PER Medvedev  ] Visit ---------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The recent announcement that [MISC Russian  ] President [PER Dmitriy Medvedev  ] will visit [LOC Serbia  ] in October to mark the 65th anniversary of the liberation of [LOC Belgrade  ] during [MISC World War II  ] by [MISC Soviet  ] forces has focused public attention on the [MISC Serbia-Russia  ] relationship and triggered press headlines heralding the “return to a brotherly embrace” with [LOC Russia  ] . 
Presidential advisor [PER Aleksandar Knezevic  ] told us on August 20 that the [MISC Russians  ] had proposed “grandiose” plans for the visit ( rumored to include a military parade ) ; [PER Knezevic  ] said the presidency would tailor the events to show that [LOC Russia  ] was one of several key partners . 
With regard to the [MISC World War II  ] celebrations in particular , he acknowledged the challenge of balancing the commemoration of the [MISC Soviet  ] role in liberating [LOC Belgrade  ] with the role of other Allies in the broader war effort . 
Presidential chief of staff [PER Miki Rakic  ] confirmed on August 25 that plans were still in flux and that the date had not been set , despite widespread press reports that it would be October 20. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The primary deliverables for the [PER Medvedev  ] visit will reportedly be a $1.4 billion [MISC Russian  ] loan for budget support and infrastructure projects and the creation of a joint venture between [ORG Gazpromneft  ] and [ORG Srbijagas  ] for the expansion of the [LOC Banatski Dvor  ] underground natural gas storage facility . 
[MISC Russian  ] Ambassador [PER Aleksandr Konuzin  ] has told the press that the two countries would sign a number of bilateral agreements but declined to reveal the topics . 
We expect that the two sides will highlight the visa-free travel arrangement that went into force on June 1 , as well as the existing bilateral [MISC Free Trade Agreement  ] . 
Political Relations: Balancing the Rhetoric ------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The dilemma that [PER Tadic  ] and his associates in the [LOC Presidency  ] face in calibrating the tone and lavishness of the [PER Medvedev  ] visit is symptomatic of [MISC Serbia’s  ] overall bilateral relationship with [LOC Russia  ] . 
They perceive a continued need for [MISC Russia’s UNSC  ] veto and rhetorical support on [LOC Kosovo  ] , particularly while the [ORG International Court of Justice  ] case is ongoing . 
At the same time , this more pragmatic group of policymakers sees that [LOC Russia  ] is not always a reliable partner - such as when the [MISC Russian  ] government used Kosovo’s declaration of independence to justify its actions in [LOC Abkhazia  ] and [LOC Ossetia  ] . 
This group also realizes that [MISC Russian  ] assistance pales in comparison to the tangible benefits of eventual [ORG European Union  ] membership . 
They argue - correctly - that the two objectives of [ORG EU  ] membership and good relations with [LOC Russia  ] need not be mutually exclusive , pointing to numerous statements by the [MISC Russian  ] government that it supports [MISC Serbia’s  ] [ORG EU  ] aspirations . 
[PER Tadic  ] and his closest foreign policy advisors therefore devote most of their energy to [MISC European  ] integration , focusing on [LOC Russia  ] only when necessary to maintain balance in outward appearances. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Vuk Jeremic  ] and his team at the Foreign Ministry take a different approach , however . 
They appear unwilling to fully commit themselves rhetorically or on a policy level to the [ORG EU  ] course , and cling to [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC China  ] , and the [ORG Non-Alignment Movement  ] as counterweights or alternatives to the [ORG EU  ] . 
Following from that logic , they see every positive interaction with [LOC Moscow  ] as a blow to [LOC Washington  ] , and even attempted to leverage the [PER Medvedev  ] visit to lobby for a meeting for FM [PER Jeremic  ] with the Secretary . 
Political Director [PER Borko Stefanovic’s  ] August 25 description to us of plans for an elaborate [PER Medvedev  ] visit was emblematic: he and possibly [PER Jeremic  ] would travel to [LOC Moscow  ] in advance of the visit to coordinate messaging ; [PER Medvedev  ] would address Parliament , becoming the first head of state to do so ; and the anniversary of the liberation of [LOC Belgrade  ] would be used to highlight [MISC Serbia’s  ] proud anti-fascist history . 
Economic Relations: Skewed to [LOC Russia’s Benefit  ] --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Russia  ] is [MISC Serbia’s  ] second largest trading partner and eighth largest source of investment . 
Bilateral trade has grown significantly in recent years , reaching a high of just over $4 billion in 2008 ; [MISC Russian  ] imports account for about 13% of [MISC Serbia’s  ] total imports . 
Numbers have fallen off in 2009 due to the global economic crisis , but the balance has remained in [LOC Russia’s  ] favor due to [MISC Serbia’s  ] heavy reliance on energy imports ; in the first six months of the year , total trade was $1.1 billion , with an $830 million trade deficit for [LOC Serbia  ] . 
Nearly 75% of [MISC Russian  ] exports to [LOC Serbia  ] are energy-related , with crude oil accounting for 49% and natural gas 25%. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Since 2000 , [MISC Russian  ] firms have invested approximately $1 billion in [LOC Serbia  ] -- $742 million in cash , and the rest in obligations for future investments . 
The 2009 purchase of [MISC Serbia’s  ] state petroleum industry , [ORG NIS  ] , by [ORG Gazpromneft  ] for $555 million ( ref B ) accounts for more than half of total [MISC Russian  ] investment . 
Other significant deals include Lukoil’s 2003 purchase of 80% of petrol distribution company Beopetrol for $187 million and auto parts producer Autodetal’s troubled 2008 purchase of a 39% stake in bus manufacturer [ORG Ikarbus  ] for $10.7 million . 
[LOC Russia’s  ] only greenfield investment in [LOC Serbia  ] to date has been the [ORG Bank of Moscow  ] , which began serving corporate and retail clients in June 2009 with $24 million in founding capital . 
The [ORG Bank of Moscow  ] appears to be focusing on potential energy deals and acquisition of [MISC Serbian  ] state-owned banks . 
Security Cooperation: All Talk , ( Almost ) No Action --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As in the political realm , [MISC Serbia’s  ] security relations with [LOC Russia  ] are more symbolic than concrete . 
Minister of [ORG Defense Sutanovac  ] meets periodically with [MISC Russian  ] counterparts and organizes photo opportunities with the handful of [MISC Serbian  ] students who attend [MISC Russian  ] military institutes each year . 
The [MISC Serbian  ] military still relies heavily on [MISC Soviet-era  ] equipment , including a dwindling fleet of [MISC MiGs  ] , and therefore remains dependent on [LOC Russia  ] for spare parts , service , and technical training ; the amount [LOC Russia  ] charges for this support is a frequent sore point . 
[MISC Serbia’s  ] military relationship with [LOC Russia  ] is largely void of content ; there are no joint operational or planning exercises . 
A recent Russian-funded demining project at the [LOC Nis Airport  ] attracted significant media coverage , despite being modest in scope . 
( Comment: In contrast to these relatively limited engagements with [LOC Russia  ] , the [MISC Serbian  ] military’s ties with the [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG NATO  ] are growing dynamically . 
In the past year alone , over 60 members of the [MISC Serbian  ] military attended [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG NCO  ] training , military academies , and war colleges ; [LOC Serbia  ] is restructuring its military on the [MISC Western/NATO  ] model ; it enjoys a dynamic relationship with the [ORG Ohio National Guard  ] ; and it is upping its involvement in [MISC Partnership for Peace  ] , including hosting the ongoing [MISC MEDCEUR  ] disaster response exercise with [ORG EUCOM  ] .

) <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) [LOC Russia  ] has not been forthcoming on [MISC Serbia’s  ] requests for assistance in locating [LOC Hague  ] indictee [PER Ratko Mladic  ] , presidential advisor [PER Miki Rakic  ] told us on August 25 . 
[PER Rakic  ] said he believed based on Mladic’s profile that the former [MISC Bosnian Serb  ] military commander was likely hiding in [LOC Serbia  ] , possibly with assistance from foreign sources . 
Asking that the information “remain at this table , ” [PER Rakic  ] told us that he had posed a series of questions about specific contacts between [PER Mladic  ] associates and [MISC Russian  ] diplomats , as well as phone calls and trips to [LOC Russia  ] by [PER Mladic  ] associates , to FSB Director [PER Aleksandr Bortnikov  ] in June , to [ORG Russian National Security Advisor  ] [PER Nikolay Patrushev  ] in July , and most recently to [ORG Presidential Administration Chief  ] of Staff [PER Vladislav Surkov  ] . 
If the [MISC Russians  ] did not respond before Medvedev’s visit , [PER Rakic  ] said , [PER Tadic  ] would raise the issue himself . 
Comment: This Is Not a Competition ----------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) While the [ORG European Union  ] is and should remain [MISC Serbia’s  ] ultimate goal , the country is also inextricably linked by energy dependency , military relationships , and cultural affinity with [LOC Russia  ] . 
The [MISC Serbian  ] government’s struggle to find the proper balance between these two imperatives stems from conflict between policymakers - such as [PER Jeremic  ] -- who see foreign policy as a zero-sum game , and those who believe in mutually beneficial relationships . 
We can strengthen the hand of pragmatic forces in the [MISC Serbian  ] government by recognizing in our public statements that [LOC Serbia  ] needs to devote effort to having a healthy , balanced relationship with [LOC Russia  ] . 
We can afford to be magnanimous on this point because we have the better story to tell: the foreign direct investment statistics and the results of our programs supporting economic , political , and security reform demonstrate that [LOC Serbia  ] benefits far more from cooperation with the [LOC United States  ] and the [LOC West  ] than it does from [MISC Russian  ] rhetoric . 
While the [MISC Serbian  ] public has not yet fully accepted these facts , our constant public diplomacy efforts to highlight the results of [LOC U.S.  ] engagement are having an impact . 
We should continue to let our actions speak louder than our words by engaging with [LOC Serbia  ] on issues of mutual interest , avoiding any direct comparisons with [LOC Russia  ] , and flatly rejecting the notion that in the 21st century any country must choose between [LOC East  ] and [LOC West  ] .
