( [ORG S  ] ) Summary . 
Foreign Minister-equivalent [PER Musa Kusa  ] told visiting Commander of [ORG U.S. Africa Command  ] General [PER William Ward  ] that [LOC Libya  ] supports engagement with the [LOC U.S.  ] military to tackle the continent 's security problems , but draws the line at " no [LOC U.S.  ] troops " in [LOC Africa  ] . 
A visible [LOC U.S.  ] military presence would do more harm than good , and serve as an attractive target for terrorists . 
[PER Kusa  ] welcomed [LOC U.S.  ] support in the form of equipment and training . 
[PER Kusa  ] placed high importance on the effectiveness of national security/intelligence agencies in combating terrorism , and said [LOC Libya  ] actively supports regional security cooperation through the [ORG African Union  ] and [MISC Cen-Sad  ] ( Community of [MISC Sahelian  ] and [LOC Saharan States  ] ) . 
[PER Gen. Ward  ] 's meeting with [LOC Col.  ] [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] reported septel . 
End Summary . 
2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) On May 21 , Secretary of the General People 's Committee for Foreign Liaison and [ORG International Cooperation  ] ( [ORG GPCFLIC  ] ) ( Foreign Minister ) [PER Musa Kusa  ] hosted [ORG U.S. Africa Command  ] ( [ORG AFRICOM  ] ) Commander General [PER William  ] " Kip " [PER Ward  ] ( [PER Gen. Ward  ] ) at the [ORG GPCFLIC  ] for an hour-long meeting . 
Also in attendance were Secretary for [MISC American  ] Affairs Dr. [PER Ahmed Fituri  ] , Ambassador , [ORG U.S. Defense Attache  ] , [ORG COS  ] , and members of [PER Gen. Ward  ] 's staff . 
3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) After a brief exchange of pleasantries , [PER Kusa  ] asked [PER Gen. Ward  ] for his views on [LOC Africa  ] . 
[PER Gen. Ward  ] replied that the [MISC African  ] continent is home to much diversity and complexity , and that throughout his travels across numerous countries he has come away with the clear sense that [MISC Africans  ] have a strong desire for peace and stability . 
[PER Kusa  ] responded that it is true that [MISC Africans  ] are a proud people who share a sense of pan-Africanism , solidarity , sovereign independence , and unity against external parties . 
Citing the example of [LOC Zimbabwe  ] President [PER Robert Mugabe  ] and the intense pressure levied against him by the international community , he noted that most [MISC African  ] nations sided with [PER Mugabe  ] , despite [PER Mugabe  ] 's mistakes . 
[PER Kusa  ] asserted that in [LOC Africa  ] , [MISC Africans  ] stay together to oppose external interference . 
Similarly , he said , when the [LOC United States  ] imposed sanctions on [LOC Libya  ] , the [MISC Arab  ] world turned its back on the [MISC Libyan  ] leader , but the [MISC Africans  ] never did . 
4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Turning to security issues , [PER Kusa  ] said that he naturally was well aware of security issues affecting the continent as he had spent the better part of the last ten years as the director of the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG External Security Organization  ] ( [ORG ESO  ] ) . 
He added that he has shared his views frequently and openly with his [LOC U.S.  ] contacts in the [ORG Central Intelligence Agency  ] ( [ORG CIA  ] ) and the [ORG Department of State  ] . 
He said that [LOC Libya  ] and the [MISC Libyan  ] people have been and will remain committed to the counterterrorism ( [LOC CT  ] ) mission . 
He said that the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG ESO  ] continues to do a good job with [ORG CIA  ] and that cooperation between the two agencies was very good . 
He had also endeavored to encourage other [MISC African  ] nations to work more closely together on [LOC CT  ] . 
He highlighted the May 17-18 [MISC CEN-SAD  ] ( Community of [MISC Sahelian  ] and [LOC Saharan States  ] ) meeting of the directors of security services hosted by the [ORG ESO  ] in [LOC Tripoli  ] , which he noted [ORG COS  ] had attended . 
He said that the directors of 27 countries had met to discuss increasing cooperation . 
5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Kusa  ] said that [LOC Libya  ] remains committed to such engagements and to encouraging multilateral cooperation , emphasizing that he has long been a proponent of multilateral cooperation through organizations that are legally established within the framework of the [ORG African Union  ] ( [ORG AU  ] ) or other internationally recognized bodies such as the [ORG United Nations  ] ( [ORG UN  ] ) . 
[PER Kusa  ] said that the [LOC U.S.'  ] support was indeed needed to bolster such programs , particularly those affecting the [MISC Sahelian  ] areas . 
Strengthening cooperation must be done in stages and one of the key outcomes of the [MISC CEN-SAD  ] meetings was to focus on building the capabilities of host nation security services . 
In this regard , [ORG AFRICOM  ] could provide equipment or training , he said , as [LOC Libya  ] has limited resources and thus could not act alone . 
6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Kusa  ] said that the presence of [LOC U.S.  ] forces in [LOC Africa  ] could be more harmful than helpful , as they would likely draw young extremists or would-be terrorists to consider attacking them . 
[PER Kusa  ] emphasized that [LOC North Africa  ] has been a source of foreign fighters headed to [LOC Iraq  ] and governments in the region have exerted tremendous efforts to stem this flow . 
However , the very presence of [LOC U.S.  ] troops inside [LOC Africa  ] could turn this flow inward into the continent which in turn would bring instability to the region . 
[PER Kusa  ] said that existing [LOC CT  ] efforts are effective and that a low profile must be maintained . 
7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Addressing the overall bilateral military to military relationship , [PER Kusa  ] said that son of the [MISC Libyan  ] leader and [ORG National Security Advisor  ] Dr. [PER Mu'tassim Billah  ] al-Qadhafi had fully briefed him on [LOC U.S.  ] military engagements conducted through the [ORG Libyan National Security Council  ] ( [ORG NSC  ] ) . 
[PER Kusa  ] said that he was supportive of what [PER Mu'tassim  ] briefed and noted that the scope of work was good . 
Although [PER Mu'tassim  ] was not in [LOC Libya  ] on this day , [PER Kusa  ] conveyed the message that efforts should be made to continue on the track that has been set with the [ORG NSC  ] . 
[LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000415 002.2 OF 002 8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In response , [PER Gen. Ward  ] said that he appreciated the good meetings that he had with [PER Mu'tassim  ] and that he appreciated [PER Kusa  ] 's comments on the region and [LOC CT  ] cooperation . 
He agreed that host nations should be in a position to handle the threats facing them , and providing equipment and training was important . 
Gen [PER Ward  ] stated that it was important for nations to work together to establish a framework of cooperation that would deny safehaven to terrorist groups on the continent . 
[ORG AFRICOM  ] shares this vision and nations that share similar security concerns should work together to this end ; the [ORG Trans-Sahel Counterterrorism Program  ] ( [ORG TSCTP  ] ) and [ORG Operation Enduring Freedom  ] - [ORG Trans-Sahel  ] ( [ORG OEFTS  ] ) are intended to support these goals . 
9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Kusa  ] commented that he saw areas of possible cooperation where both sides shared common objectives , especially regarding political and security matters , to be considered at the [ORG AU  ] level . 
[PER Kusa  ] stated that the [ORG AU  ] intended to call for the formation of a unified [ORG AU  ] military contingent that would be presided over by an [ORG AU  ] Secretary for the Military . 
[PER Kusa  ] opined that perhaps the [LOC United States  ] could engage the [ORG AU  ] and discover areas of potential military cooperation with the [ORG AU  ] unified military command . 
Working through the [ORG AU  ] construct would be beneficial to the [LOC U.S.  ] and cooperation on the political level would support policies directed at unifying the [MISC African  ] states . 
[PER Kusa  ] said that the union of [MISC African  ] states was the most effective and beneficial solution for all [MISC African  ] nations . 
10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Kusa  ] raised what he characterized as the threat posed by the increasing presence of [MISC Chinese  ] in [LOC Africa  ] . 
Although [MISC Chinese  ] do not interfere in internal political affairs , which is why [MISC African  ] leaders find it easy to work with them , the [MISC Chinese  ] have begun to indirectly interfere in the sovereignty of nations . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] population in [LOC Africa  ] is significant and growing , and [LOC China  ] is intent on imbedding itself through its economic programs to build infrastructure , schools , etc . 
11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Kusa  ] concluded the meeting by stating that the [LOC U.S.  ] military engagement with [LOC Libya  ] is positive and should continue . 
The [MISC Libyan  ] leadership is supportive of these endeavors. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>Â¶</a>12 .
