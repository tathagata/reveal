In nationally televised October 5 comments from the event , [MISC Libyan  ] leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] called for an October 6 " secret " meeting among senior [MISC Libyan  ] officials to discuss " internal matters , " an effort perhaps to belie rumored criticism that , in contrast to previous years , no domestic policy address was delivered during [LOC Libya  ] 's recent September 1 festivities . 
Independent website [LOC Libya  ] al-Youm , citing contacts who allegedly were in attendance at the October 6 meeting , reported that al-Qadhafi praised his second son [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi , and called on the [ORG People 's Congresses  ] to create a non-term limited governmental role for him . 
If true , this report -- the only account yet from the closed October 6 meeting -- may signal that , after a rollercoaster year , [PER Saif  ] al-Islam will once again assume the mantle of heir apparent . 
It remains to be seen whether the creation of a formal governmental role for [PER Saif  ] al-Islam will become a reality , or simply join the long list of other ambitious , much-heralded , and as-yet-unrealized initiatives such as wealth distribution , government restructuring , and major cabinet shake-ups . 
End Summary . 
[LOC LIBYA  ] AL-YOUM REPORTS THAT MUAMMAR WANTS SAIF TO GET A FORMAL JOB 2 . 
( C ) During a televised October 5 speech in [LOC Sebha  ] marking the 50th anniversary of the [ORG Free Officers Movement  ] , [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi called for a " secret " October 6 meeting among [MISC Libyan  ] officials to discuss domestic affairs . 
While some international press reports mentioned the planned " secret " meeting , the press blackout in [LOC Libya  ] has been nearly total , aided by [LOC Sebha  ] 's remote location approximately 400 miles south of [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
Opposition-leaning news website [LOC Libya  ] al-Youm , the only press outlet to yet discuss the event , posted an article October 7 on the meeting . 
Citing unnamed sources who allegedly were in attendance , the article quotes [PER Qadhafi  ] as lauding his second son , [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi , as a man who is " loyal and loves [LOC Libya  ] , " and noting that his current lack of a formal position has created " some problems . 
" The [MISC Libyan  ] leader then called on the members of the [ORG People 's Congresses  ] to create a position for [PER Saif  ] al-Islam outside of the General [ORG People 's Committee  ] ( [ORG GPC  ] ) secretariat . 
The elder [PER Qadhafi  ] reportedly argued that the usual four-year term of the [ORG GPC  ] would not permit his son sufficient time to execute programs " in the interest of the [LOC Libya  ] of tomorrow . 
" ( Note: It is unlikely that [LOC Saif  ] al-Islam was present at the meeting . 
[MISC Russian  ] diplomats reported he was in eastern [LOC Russia  ] in early October for a hunting trip and press reports indicate he visited [LOC Mongolia  ] on or around October 5.End note ) . 
" SECRET " MEETING ECHOES RUMORS IN DECEMBER.. . 
3 . 
( [LOC C//NF  ] ) [LOC Libya  ] al-Youm 's unverified reports and [PER Qadhafi  ] 's request for a press-free meeting are reminiscent of similar events in December 2008 ( ref A ) . 
At that time , following a televised speech to key advisors , [PER Qadhafi  ] asked that cameras and recording equipment be shut off and told the assembled that [LOC Libya  ] was entering a " new political period " and would hold elections for some key offices " soon " . 
Drafts of a constitution seen then by well-connected [ORG UN  ] contacts included a new , non-term limited position with broad executive powers as the head of a 100-person " [ORG Senate  ] " that was widely viewed as a vehicle for [PER Saif  ] al-Islam to take a formal role within the government . 
However , the constitution was subsequently removed from the agenda of March 's General People 's [ORG Congress  ] session ( ref B ) -- the beginning of a six-month slide in [LOC Saif  ] al-Islam 's prominence that saw his media group nationalized ( ref C ) and his younger brother [ORG National Security Advisor Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi , not [LOC Saif  ] al-Islam , accompany his father to the [ORG United Nations  ] in September. ~BUT DIPLOMATIC CORPS GIVEN NO DETAILS 4 . 
( C ) Joining the rest of the diplomatic corps , the [ORG CDA  ] was shuttled to [LOC Sebha  ] on October 7 to attend the closing of the three-day festival . 
Senior [LOC Libya  ] officials including Foreign Minister [PER Musa Kusa  ] and Director of Military Intelligence [PER Abdulla Sannusi  ] have reportedly been in the oasis town since October 4 , and various [MISC Arab  ] and [MISC African  ] delegations also participated . 
[MISC Libyan  ] officials demonstrated tell-tale signs that [PER Qadhafi  ] would address the assembled: cell phones were confiscated and hurried [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000805 002 OF 002 arrangements were made in the hall where an Extraordinary Session of the General People 's [ORG Congress  ] had been convened to designate various locations from al-Qadhafi 's life as national historic sites . 
However , [PER Qadhafi  ] never showed up , and other government officials have not yet divulged the content of the October 6 meeting . 
[ORG COMMENT  ] 5 . 
( C ) The closed October 6 meeting and [LOC Libya  ] al-Youm 's report have renewed chatter in [LOC Tripoli  ] that [LOC Saif  ] al-Islam is once again ascendant and still the heir apparent . 
Many [MISC Libyans  ] expected an announcement in September that [PER Qadhafi  ] pere would take on a more international role and that [LOC Saif  ] al-Islam would make a strong return to domestic politics -- a view bolstered by images of [LOC Saif  ] al-Islam hugging [LOC Lockerbie  ] bomber [PER Abdel Basset  ] al-Megrahi upon his August 20 arrival in [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
If [LOC Libya  ] al-Youm 's report is confirmed , it remains to be seen whether the creation of a formal governmental role for [PER Saif  ] al-Islam will become reality , or simply join other ambitious , much-heralded , and as-yet-unrealized initiatives such as wealth distribution , government restructuring , and major cabinet shake-ups .
