( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY . 
[LOC Iceland  ] [ORG Central Bank  ] 's Chairman of the [ORG Board of Governors  ] , [PER David Oddsson  ] , refused Prime Minister [PER Johanna Sigurdardottir  ] 's request to resign on Sunday . 
The Prime Minister made her request by letter of February 2 , pending passage of a law allowing the government to dismiss the three governors . 
The two other [ORG Board  ] governors , [PER Ingimundur Fridriksson  ] and [PER Eirikur Gudnason  ] , also received letters . 
Mr. [PER Gudnason  ] followed Mr. [PER Oddsson  ] and refused to resign , while [PER Fridriksson  ] agreed to step down . 
The Prime Minister expressed extreme disappointment with [PER Oddsson  ] 's decision , stating that the people of [LOC Iceland  ] need new leadership in order to restore trust in the [ORG Central Bank  ] . 
END SUMMARY ------------------------------------------- PM Calls for [ORG Central Bank  ] Directors to Resign ------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) PM [PER Johanna Sigurdardottir  ] sent a letter to the three [ORG Central Bank  ] governors on February 2 , asking them to hand in their resignations by February 6 . 
In the letter , the Prime Minister stated her desire to replace the [ORG Central Bank Board  ] with a single new director under a proposed law reorganizing the structure and management of the [ORG Bank  ] . 
The new bill , to be considered by Parliament shortly , would replace the tripartite board with a single director , appointed by the Prime Minister for a seven-year term . 
The Director position would be publically advertised and filled with an experienced banking professional with at least a master 's degree in economics ( [PER Oddsson  ] is a professional politician with no economics education ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In addition , the proposed legislation would create a new [ORG Monetary Policy Committee  ] within the [ORG Bank  ] . 
The [ORG Monetary Policy Committee  ] would be comprised of five members: the Governor of the [ORG Central Bank  ] , who would chair the committee , two of the [ORG Bank  ] 's executives responsible for formulating and implementing monetary policy , and two experts appointed by the Governor with the endorsement of the Prime Minister . 
The [ORG Monetary Policy Committee  ] would make all decisions on the [ORG Bank  ] 's monetary policy control mechanisms. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On February 6 , [PER Ingimundur Fridiksson  ] sent his response stating his intention to resign . 
[PER Eirikur Gudnason  ] declared his intention to stay on . 
[PER David Oddsson  ] waited to February 8 to announce his decision to stay on , when a copy of his response letter to the Prime Minister was made public on the [ORG Central Bank of Iceland  ] 's website. ---------------------------- [PER David  ] 's Response: I Won't Go ---------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER David  ] 's [PER Oddsson  ] 's response to the Prime Minister was a scathing rebuttal to her request . 
He said her letter was threatening , and accused the governing coalition of misconduct and biased conclusions . 
[PER Oddsson  ] claims that he and the [ORG Central Bank Board of Governors  ] were among the first to warn of the impending banking collapse , and pointed the finger at unnamed ministers whose motive for getting [PER Oddsson  ] out of the [ORG Bank  ] is personal vengeance rather than " substantive fault with ( his ) work . 
" Leaving little doubt as to his intentions , [PER Oddsson  ] defiantly concludes , " For my part , I have never abandoned any task that I have agreed to take on , and I do not intend to do so now . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On Sunday evening , the PM of [LOC Iceland  ] issued a statement in response to [PER Oddsson  ] 's letter , stating that [PER Oddsson  ] clearly did not share the government 's opinion that appointing new employees to the [ORG Central Bank  ] would increase the people 's faith in the system . 
She also stated her hope that the bill on the reorganization of the [ORG Central Bank  ] would be passed quickly by [MISC Parliament.  ] ------------------------------------ [ORG Legal Authority  ] for [ORG Dismissal Unclear  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Prime Minister 's legal recourse is unclear . 
There is no custom or precedent to fire [ORG Central Bank  ] governors . 
Under the Law on the [ORG Central Bank  ] on [LOC Iceland  ] ( 2001 ) , and according to the Law on the Rights and Duties of [MISC Civil Servants  ] , however , it is possible for a governor to be " dismissed temporarily " if he has not been punctual , or has shown other negligence , disobedience to a legal request or prohibition from his superior , ignorance , or carelessness on the job . 
In addition , he can be " dismissed temporarily " if he has shown unsatisfactory results , has been inebriated on the job or his behavior or actions [ on the job ] has otherwise been considered improper , inappropriate , or irreconcilable with the job . 
It remains to be seen if the Prime Minister will try to use existing statutes to fire [PER Oddsson  ] immediately or wait until the Parliament 's near certain passage of the new [ORG Central Bank  ] law. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) COMMENT . 
Many believe the Prime Minister will wait until the new [ORG Central Bank  ] legislation is enacted . 
The new legislation would automatically make the [ORG Bank Board  ] positions redundant . 
[LOC Iceland  ] 's public continues to demand accountability and express their strong desire to clean house . 
Editorials wonder why [PER Oddsson  ] refuses to leave when his very presence in the [ORG Central Bank  ] does nothing but harm the international standing of the tattered [MISC Icelandic  ] financial sector . 
[PER Oddsson  ] may believe he played no role [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000030 002 OF 002 in the economic crash , but many Icelanders ( and much of the international economic press ) hold the [ORG Bank  ] - and [PER Oddsson  ] in particular - responsible for not curbing the banks . 
Meanwhile , the public bickering between the Prime Minister and the [ORG Central Bank  ] Director has done little to shore up international investor confidence in the country . 
It is still an open question whether [PER Oddsson  ] has the political backing from the old guard [ORG Independence Party  ] to withstand the demand of the public and government to step down . 
Demonstrators , fresh from bringing down the previous government , have assembled again in front of the [ORG Bank  ] . 
END COMMENT .
