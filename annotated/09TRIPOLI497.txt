<code><pre>UNCLAS [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 000497 SENSITIVE SIPDIS FOR NEA/MAG , NEA/PPD AND CA/VO/F/P E.O. 12958: N/A TAGS: <a href='/tag/PREL_0.html'>PREL</a> <a href='/tag/CVIS_0.html'>CVIS</a> <a href='/tag/LY_0.html'>LY</a> SUBJECT: FM KUSA: " STEP BY STEP " APPROACH TO VISA FOR AMERICANS 1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) During a June 21 meeting with FM [PER Musa Kusa  ] , Ambassador noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] had begun full visa operations for [MISC Libyans  ] in [LOC Tripoli  ] and had already issued over 800 non-immigrant visas to [MISC Libyans  ] with limited wait times . 
By contrast , the [ORG GOL  ] still followed a restrictive visa policy when it came to [MISC Americans  ] , including an apparent ban on [MISC American  ] tourists , lengthy delays and high fees for [MISC American  ] business people , and a long record of visa denials for [MISC USG-sponsored  ] cultural and academic visitors . 
Now that the [LOC US  ] and [LOC Libya  ] had restored bilateral relations , the [ORG USG  ] expected to see greater reciprocity in visa policy . 
2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Kusa  ] acknowledged that [LOC US  ] visa policy was generous with respect to most [MISC Libyans  ] , although there had been delays in the cases of certain [MISC Libyan  ] officials . 
He said the [ORG GOL  ] had opened the door to [MISC American  ] business people , investors and employees of [LOC US  ] oil and gas companies . 
These applicants often received multiple entry visas , he noted ( in contrast to the [LOC US  ] 's more limited single-entry visas for [MISC Libyan  ] business people ) . 
To the extent there were delays , it was due to the small consular section in the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Washington  ] . 
When the Ambassador pointed out that the [ORG US Embassy  ] continued to hear stories of extortionate fees being demanded of [LOC US  ] business people by [MISC Libyan  ] middle-men , [PER Kusa  ] said he was aware of the problem , which he characterized as " corruption , " and was trying to stamp it out . 
The Ambassador also noted there were other obstacles , both bureaucratic and personnel , that may also be contributing to an apparent virtual standstill in visa issuance for [MISC Americans  ] . 
He asked [PER Kusa  ] to look into these as well . 
3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As for [MISC American  ] tourists , [PER Kusa  ] said [LOC Libya  ] 's restrictive policy was security-related . 
He recounted a time two years ago when a cruise ship with several hundred [MISC Americans  ] onboard had attempted to unload the passengers in the eastern [MISC Libyan  ] town of [LOC Darna  ] , the locus of foreign fighters heading to [LOC Iraq  ] . 
As head of [LOC Libya  ] 's security organization at the time , he immediately ordered the ship not to let the [MISC Americans  ] disembark , given the presence of so many extremists in the town . 
His point , he said , was that [MISC Americans  ] remained vulnerable to attack by extremists , due to controversial [LOC US  ] policies over the past several years . 
He was also concerned about " adventure tourists " who wanted to explore [LOC Libya  ] 's deserts . 
Sometimes these people got lost ; so far none had been kidnapped , as had occurred in neighboring countries . 
The [ORG GOL  ] , he said , was still looking for two missing foreigners -- [MISC Italian  ] and [MISC Japanese  ] -- who disappeared in the desert during a motorcycle expedition . 
4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ambassador asked why the [ORG GOL  ] could not at least treat [MISC Americans  ] as they do [MISC Europeans  ] and allow tourists to come either in groups or in connection with organized tours by authorized [MISC Libyan  ] tour companies . 
[PER Kusa  ] dismissed this idea , saying that [MISC Americans  ] remained a more attractive target for terrorists than [MISC Europeans  ] . 
Under the [ORG Obama Administration  ] , [PER Kusa  ] said , he expected attitudes toward [MISC Americans  ] to eventually improve , especially if progress could be made in solving the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] conflict . 
Consequently , in his view , opening up [LOC Libya  ] to increasing numbers of [MISC American  ] visitors had to be a " step by step " process. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>Â¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On [MISC USG-sponsored  ] exchange visitors and on other non-responses to requests , [PER Kusa  ] agreed to review the situation . 
Ambassador offered to provide a list of visa denials in these cases . 
6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: We find [PER Kusa  ] 's justification for the total ban on [MISC American  ] tourists to be unconvincing . 
A few years ago , [LOC Libya  ] did in fact briefly permit [MISC Americans  ] to visit [LOC Libya  ] , provided they came as part of an organized tour or aboard a cruise ship . 
In these cases , the [ORG GOL  ] has advance notification of the visit itinerary and can provide appropriate security , as it does in the case of [MISC European  ] and other visitors . 
We will need to continue to test his assertions regarding [LOC Libya  ] 's " open doors " to [MISC American  ] business visitors , and to assist the [ORG GOL  ] to weed out corrupt middle-men by providing information on such practices to the [ORG GOL  ] as it becomes available . 
On [MISC USG-sponsored  ] exchange visitors , we will follow up by providing the [ORG MFA  ] with our long list of aborted visits and attempt to determine whether this is a policy decision or the work of lower-level personnel who oppose [LOC U.S.  ] engagement with [MISC Libyans  ] in [LOC Libya  ] . 
The good news here is continued [ORG GOL  ] interest in [LOC U.S.  ] visas and a commitment to look into the problematic issues we raised regarding lack of visa issuance . 
We will now press the [ORG MFA  ] to make good on its commitment to establish an interagency working group to discuss these issues with us .
