You will arrive at a time of strong [MISC GOP  ] interest in expanding security cooperation with the [LOC United States  ] . 
Under President [PER Alan Garcia  ] , [LOC Peru  ] has been a reliable [LOC U.S.  ] partner and played a constructive role in a complicated [LOC South America  ] characterized by resurgent populism and periodic flashes of tension -- most recently between [LOC Colombia  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
Notwithstanding its recent strong economic growth and falling poverty levels , [LOC Peru  ] still faces real security threats , primarily relating to drug trafficking and reemerging [ORG Shining Path  ] terrorism . 
Your visit affords an opportunity to underscore our interest in supporting the [MISC GOP  ] 's efforts to combat these threats in the several discrete areas where we are best positioned to help . 
[MISC Peruvian  ] sensitivities regarding [LOC U.S.  ] Arms Sales to [LOC Chile  ] , although overshadowed by allegations of [MISC Chilean  ] espionage , remain acute and are likely to figure prominently in your meetings here . 
End Summary . 
Peru: A Good Friend in the [LOC Region  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) We have built a strong bilateral relationship with [LOC Peru  ] in recent years , partly embodied in the [ORG Peru Trade Promotion Agreement  ] ( [ORG PTPA  ] ) . 
We also share a similar strategic vision , namely that the region 's foremost security threats originate from transnational and non-state criminal actors such as narco-traffickers and terrorists , as well as resurgent populism and the meddling of [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Hugo Chavez  ] and his allies . 
At the same time , we have sought to support [LOC Peru  ] 's efforts to address the underlying causes of these threats -- including persistent ( if falling ) poverty , corruption and social inequality -- and to spread the benefits of economic development more widely . 
We have also sought to support [LOC Peru  ] 's plan to reorient its security posture away from its perceived conventional threats from its neighbors ( mainly [LOC Chile  ] ) and to modernize its military 's doctrines and retool its operational capabilities to confront its internal threats . 
The [MISC GOP  ] sees the [LOC U.S.  ] as an ally and has asked for our help . 
Despite our broadly shared interests , however , domestic and regional sensitivities about a too close military-security embrace with the [LOC United States  ] persist. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [MISC GOP  ] has played a constructive role in the region and sees challenges and opportunities through a similar policy prism . 
Under [PER Garcia  ] , [LOC Peru  ] has helped to counter [LOC Bolivia  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] 's efforts to blame the [LOC U.S.  ] for rising regional tensions . 
In the recent [ORG UNASUR  ] President 's meeting in [LOC Bariloche  ] , for example , [PER Garcia  ] vigorously defended [LOC Colombia  ] 's sovereign right to work formally with the [LOC U.S.  ] in combating drug trafficking and terrorism by means of the [ORG Defense Cooperation Agreement  ] ( [ORG DCA  ] ) . 
[LOC Peru  ] was active in helping defuse the [MISC Colombia-Ecuador  ] crisis in March 2008 , and continues to seek to help repair and restore relations between those two countries . 
( Note: [MISC Colombian  ] Embassy officials here have told us that [LOC Peru  ] is [LOC Colombia  ] 's " only ally " in the region . 
" End Note . 
) President [PER Garcia  ] 's recent " Peace and [ORG Security Cooperation  ] " initiative appears to be a serious attempt to promote regional stability and contain defense costs at a time of global economic recession . 
[PER Garcia  ] 's proposals seek to prevent an arms race in the region , reduce military expenditures , formalize a non-aggression pact and field a regional defense force ( " [LOC Fuerza Sudamericana  ] de [ORG Paz  ] e [PER Intervencion  ] " ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [LOC Peru  ] 's relations with [LOC Chile  ] have been rocky following [LOC Peru  ] 's decision to take its maritime border dispute with [LOC Chile  ] to the [ORG International Court of Justice  ] in early 2008 . 
Ties soured further following [MISC Peruvian  ] complaints over [LOC Chile  ] 's " Salitre 2009 " war games and have grown even tenser in the wake of allegations of [MISC Chilean  ] spying . 
Relations with [LOC Bolivia  ] have also been strained over alleged [MISC Bolivian  ] political meddling , and personal insults between Presidents [PER Garcia  ] and [PER Morales  ] . 
The [MISC GOP  ] remains concerned that [LOC Venezuela  ] is trying to sow instability in the region through its covert support of radical and indigenous groups in [LOC Peru  ] and elsewhere . 
[LOC Peru  ] 's robust engagement with ( its former enemy ) [LOC Ecuador  ] represents its greatest diplomatic success to date , which MFA officials have told us is their " number one " foreign policy objective . 
[LOC Peru  ] has signed onto [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG UNASUR  ] South [MISC American  ] integration plan and it desires a " strategic relationship " with [LOC Brazil  ] , focused on integrating infrastructure such as the new inter-oceanic highways and investment . 
While it has respectful relations with other countries in the region , [LOC Peru  ] feels a special kinship with [LOC Colombia  ] for their similar drug trafficking and terrorism challenges and their shared view that free trade and openness to investment are the best way to foment economic growth and advance national development . 
[LOC Peru  ] 's [ORG Security Challenges  ] and Threats <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Notwithstanding its recent strong economic growth and generally falling poverty levels , [LOC Peru  ] faces a series of largely internal security challenges that could threaten its stability and continued progress . 
Social conflict is one , and the June 5 violence in the northern [MISC Amazon  ] city of [LOC Bagua  ] in which 24 policemen and 10 civilians were killed was the government 's most serious crisis to date . 
While a series of government miscalculations and missteps was largely to blame , radical and possibly foreign interference also played a role . 
That said , [MISC Peruvian  ] military officials are likely to focus their discussions with you on the security challenges connected with drug trafficking and terrorism . 
[MISC GOP  ] briefings to [LOC U.S.  ] officials tend to downplay or omit perceived external threats to [LOC Peru  ] such as [LOC Chile  ] or [LOC Bolivia  ] , but military planning , doctrine , force structure and spending remain ( in our view ) disproportionately focused on such threats. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) Many analysts believe that [ORG SL  ] , and its expanding connections with drug trafficking , is [LOC Peru  ] 's primary security threat - particularly in the [LOC VRAE  ] . 
While there is continuing debate about whether [ORG SL  ] has abandoned its ideological struggle and become just another narco-trafficking group , or rather adapted its approach to the historical realities of the day while maintaining its essentially political goals , the fact is that we know little about its true intentions . 
[LOC Peru  ] 's own intelligence apparatus , in disrepair since the collapse of the [MISC Fujimori  ] regime , has only recently begun to rebuild its capabilities . 
What is known is that the [ORG SL  ] threat was contained but not eliminated and may now again be expanding . 
Over the past 18 months , terrorists have killed over 50 security forces , mostly in ambushes on isolated military patrols but in some cases in direct assaults on provisional military bases established as part of a targeted military operation in the heart of [ORG SL  ] terrain . 
Additionally , [ORG SL  ] members have conducted civic actions to gain the sympathy of local people and communities that have been largely abandoned by the state . 
Where the [LOC U.S.  ] Can Help <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) Your visit affords an opportunity to underscore [ORG USG  ] interest in supporting the [MISC GOP  ] 's efforts to combat these threats in the several discrete areas where we are best positioned to help . 
The key word , however , is " supporting . 
" In this context , the [MISC GOP  ] needs to develop a more effective political/military strategy for turning the tide against a reemerging [ORG SL  ] increasingly intertwined with drug trafficking . 
We can help the [MISC GOP  ] to fine-tune its plans , but government leaders must demonstrate the political will by committing funds , setting goals and benchmarks , and decisively moving forward on implementation . 
There have been some encouraging signs in this respect. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C/NF ) If an effective counternarcotics campaign and broader development objectives in the [LOC VRAE  ] presuppose security , the most critical security need in the [LOC VRAE  ] is for improved intelligence . 
In this connection , the [MISC GOP  ] is seeking to rebuild its human collection capabilities . 
They also seek help in the area of electronic intelligence , particularly to see from above the dense jungle canopy . 
To seize the initiative and carry the fight to the [ORG SL  ] , [LOC Peru  ] 's Armed Forces also seek support in training , equipment and transport . 
After extensive discussions at all levels , the [MISC GOP  ] may ask for the [ORG USG  ] to assist it in the three following areas: --- Help improve [LOC Peru  ] 's intelligence capabilities by providing [ORG FLIR  ] , UAVs , and satellite imagery ; --- Replace , replenish or repair their moribund helicopter fleet and ; --- Support the construction of a fixed-wing airfield in [LOC Pichari  ] and supply equipment and training , including on countering [ORG SL  ] 's increased use of home-made [MISC IEDs  ] , mines and booby traps . 
While [LOC Peru  ] 's security forces have welcomed a broad [MISC USG-led  ] ( " [ORG Tiger Team  ] " ) security review of their existing capabilities and threats , you should be prepared to discuss our ability to support , in these several discrete ways , [MISC Peruvian  ] efforts to confront its real and immediate internal security threats in the [LOC VRAE  ] . 
Tensions with [ORG Chile: Distracting the Focus  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) [MISC Peruvian  ] sensitivities regarding [LOC U.S.  ] Arms sales to [LOC Chile  ] remain acute . 
The announced prospective [LOC U.S.  ] sale to [LOC Chile  ] of a [MISC Sentinel Radar  ] system , a land to air defensive platform ( Avenger ) with stinger missiles , and 100 [ORG AMRAAM  ] missiles to equip the 18 F-16s [LOC Chile  ] recently purchased from [LOC Holland  ] caused rankles in [LOC Peru  ] , particularly as the government was then actively and very publicly promoting its " [MISC Peace And Disarmament  ] " initiative with leaders around the region . 
That announcement has been overshadowed by allegations that a [MISC Peruvian  ] [ORG Air Force  ] NCO had been spying on [LOC Chile  ] 's behalf for the past 5 years - allegations that have dominated [LOC Peru  ] 's media for the past 10 days and sent its relations with [LOC Chile  ] into a tailspin . 
Still , the [LOC U.S.  ] arms sales are present in the minds of [MISC Peruvian  ] political and military leaders , as tilting the military balance even more decisively in favor of [LOC Chile  ] , and are likely to figure prominently in your meetings here .
