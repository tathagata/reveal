<code><pre>S E C R E T FREETOWN 000406 SIPDIS DEPARTMENT FOR AF/W ( JJHUNTER ) EO 12958 DECL: 08/15/2018 TAGS SNAR , PREL , PGOV , SL , GV SUBJECT: [PER KOROMA  ] REQUESTS ASSISTANCE WITH [MISC GUINEAN  ] DRUG ARREST REF: A. FREETOWN 336 B. FREETOWN 405 Classified By: [ORG CDA  ] [PER Glenn Fedzer  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b/e ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary: President [PER Koroma  ] called the [ORG CDA  ] to a meeting August 15 to request USG assistance to arrest a fugitive trafficker linked to last month’s seizure of 750 kilos of cocaine ( reftel A ) and now believed to be in [LOC Conakry  ] . 
[PER Koroma  ] believed he could not make the request directly to the [MISC Guinean  ] President without Conte’s inner circle tipping off the trafficker before he could be captured . 
President [PER Koroma  ] and an assistant also clarified information on the temporary detention of Conte’s “wife” at the border with nearly a million dollars in gold and currency ( reftel B ) . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) President [PER Koroma  ] requested August 15 that the [LOC United States  ] Government pressure [LOC Guinea  ] to arrest and extradite [PER Gibrilla Kamara  ] , a high-level trafficker associated with the cartel behind last month’s shipment of 750 Kilos of cocaine seized in [LOC Lungi  ] , [LOC Sierra Leone  ] ( reftel A ) . 
[PER Koroma  ] said they were tracking [MISC Kamara’s  ] movements in [LOC Conakry  ] and wanted him arrested immediately , but were constrained in their options . 
[PER Koroma  ] considered engaging President [PER Conte  ] on this matter , but because [PER Conte  ] is old , weak , and in poor health , [PER Koroma  ] felt word would get out through his underlings and jeopardize the capture . 
He felt a second , better option was to have the [ORG U.S. Government  ] “pressure” [PER Conte  ] to have [MISC Guinean  ] police apprehend [PER Kamara  ] and return him to [LOC Sierra Leone.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) President [PER Koroma  ] and his personal secretary also provided new details regarding the flight of President Conte’s “wife” [PER Zainab  ] across the [LOC Sierra Leone-Guinea  ] border with hundreds of thousands of dollars , [PER Euros  ] , as well as luxury vehicles and gold bullion . 
The woman was not [PER Henriette Conte  ] , as initially reported in reftel B , but [PER Zainab Conte  ] . 
Little seemed known about her , even to the President’s advisor , other than her first name , her [ORG Sierra Leonean  ] roots , her relationship with [PER Conte  ] , and a story that she was also the mistress of a former President of [LOC Sierra Leone  ] . 
She was detained at the border at 9pm on August 12 , and held for approximately 12 hours . 
Word of her detention reached a Presidential aide , and officials deliberated at length about how to proceed . 
They considered the issue of diplomatic immunity ( Note: It is unclear whether or not [PER Zainab  ] has diplomatic status . 
End note ) , as well as the potential for violence at the hands of [MISC Guinean  ] military should she not be released . 
The tipping-point was a call from President [PER Conte  ] to President [PER Koroma  ] , personally requesting her release. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) A presidential advisor reported that , though border officials detained [PER Zainab  ] and a convoy of three luxury vehicles , they waved other vehicles through , not realizing one contained the long-sought after [PER Gibrilla Kamara  ] ( aka GK ) . 
[PER Kamara  ] is a prime suspect in the July 13 cocaine bust , and the only “big fish” remaining outside the net of the [LOC Sierra Leone  ] Police . 
Thought to be one of the drug trafficking ring’s key facilitators , rumors abounded that he had fled to [LOC Guinea  ] shortly after the bust . 
It now appears that [PER Kamara  ] remained in [LOC Sierra Leone  ] with the currency and other valuables , with the intention of crossing the border under the protection of [PER Zainab.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Comment: Given the Government of [ORG Sierra Leone’s  ] initial hesitation to accept high-level USG assistance on the cocaine bust , it is encouraging that the President is now actively requesting help with what could be a very delicate diplomatic , political , and security issue . 
While the “loot” he was accompanying is likely well-hidden , arresting [PER Kamara  ] could be the key to identifying and capturing other [MISC Sierra Leoneans  ] within the highest echelon of the drug trafficking syndicate . 
Sadly for the President , public awareness of [PER Kamara  ] and [PER Zainab’s  ] escape , especially with the loot in hand , will damage Koroma’s efforts to project an anti-corruption image for himself and his party to the people of [LOC Sierra Leone  ] . 
End Comment .
