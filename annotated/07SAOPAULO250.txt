[ORG Summary: On March  ] 21 , [PER Pope Benedict XVI  ] named Bishop [PER Odilo Pedro Scherer  ] , Secretary-General of the [ORG National Conference of Bishops of Brazil  ] ( [ORG CNBB  ] ) , to be the next Archbishop of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] . 
Dom [PER Odilo  ] replaces Dom [PER Claudio Hummes  ] , who in October of last year was named Cardinal Prefect of the [ORG Congregation for the Clergy  ] . 
The new Archbishop served previously as Auxiliary Bishop of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] under Cardinal [PER Hummes  ] and is expected to provide continuity to the world 's third largest archdiocese . 
Dom [PER Odilo  ] has been considered a conservative voice in the [ORG CNBB  ] , meaning that he has opposed having the Church tied to any political party and has spoken out on behalf of traditional moral values . 
At the same time , he strongly supports [MISC Catholics'  ] participation in politics , arguing that disdain for the political process can create a vacuum opening the way to tyranny and dictatorship . 
Bishop [PER Scherer  ] is scheduled to be sworn in on April 29 and will likely have high visibility during the [PER Pope  ] 's May 9-13 visit to [LOC Sao Paulo  ] . 
There is already considerable speculation that he will receive his Cardinal 's red hat in the next few years . 
End Summary. --------------- BIOGRAPHIC NOTE --------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
[PER Odilo Scherer  ] was born in 1949 in [LOC Cerro Largo  ] , [LOC Rio Grande  ] do Sul state . 
Like his two immediate predecessors , [PER Hummes  ] ( 1998-2006 ) and Cardinal [PER Paulo Evaristo Arns  ] ( 1970-1998 ) , he is a southern [MISC Brazilian  ] of [MISC German  ] heritage ( his grandparents were [MISC German  ] immigrants ) . 
[PER Scherer  ] grew up in [LOC Curitiba  ] , capital of [LOC Parana  ] state , and in [LOC Toledo  ] in the rural western part of the state . 
His father owned a small plot of land and supported his eleven children by selling agricultural goods . 
Dom [PER Odilo  ] was ordained in 1976 and was consecrated bishop in 2002 . 
He has spent many years in [LOC Rome  ] , serving in several [LOC Vatican  ] offices and pursuing advanced studies at the [ORG Gregorian University  ] , earning a Master 's and a Doctorate in theology . 
In 2002 he returned to [LOC Brazil  ] to take up duties as Auxiliary Bishop of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , and was elected in 2003 to his current position at the [LOC CNBB.  ] ------------------------------------ PARTICIPATION IN POLITICS IS HEALTHY ------------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
Bishop [PER Scherer  ] represents a new generation of [MISC Brazilian  ] Catholic bishops who , under the influence of [PER Pope John Paul II  ] , helped reduce the influence of liberation theology over the Church in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
He is expected as Archbishop to devote more attention to religious and moral issues and less to politics . 
This does not mean , however , that he will avoid political confrontations should they arise . 
In contrast to Cardinal [PER Hummes  ] , who is moderate , subtle , and understated , Bishop [PER Odilo  ] is considered plain-spoken and politically independent . 
In a December 2006 interview , he decried a " prejudice against politics " on the part of those [MISC Brazilians  ] who , alienated by corruption scandals , suspended their participation in political life . 
The idea of waiting until the system has been cleansed of corruption , he said , doesn't work . 
Rather , the faithful should enter the political arena to help make it cleaner and more transparent . 
" I don't think we can wait for angels to come down from heaven to govern [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Chaos arises from the hatred of politics , and absolutism gains the upper hand . 
Hatred of politics leads to despotism . 
" ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
One challenge facing the new Archbishop is the impressive growth of evangelical protestant movements , which now boast approximately 22 million followers in [LOC Brazil  ] , many of them former [MISC Catholics  ] . 
[PER Scherer  ] 's friends and family note that he grew up in a rural area of southern [LOC Brazil  ] with a mixture of [MISC Catholics  ] and [MISC Lutherans  ] and was ecumenical before it became popular . 
His mission is to help the Church in [LOC Brazil  ] to return to its religious roots while at the same time broadening its popular appeal . 
In this regard , he expressed the intention of continuing his predecessors' efforts to raise the profile and relevance of the Church in the periphery of metropolitan [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , which remains rife with poverty , social exclusion , and violence . 
Right now , [PER Scherer  ] 's immediate priority is to lead efforts to prepare for the May 9-13 visit of the [PER Pope  ] , who is scheduled to inaugurate a conference of [MISC Latin American  ] and [ORG Caribbean  ] bishops at the national shrine in [LOC Aparecida  ] , [LOC Sao Paulo  ] state , and to canonize the first [MISC Brazilian-born  ] saint , [PER Frei Antonio Galvao  ] ( 1739-1822 ) .
