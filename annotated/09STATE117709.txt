Balton  ] , reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) Summary: <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C/NF ) This is an action request . 
See paragraph 3 . 
Post is requested to discuss with State Secretary for Foreign Affairs [PER Tetsuro Fukuyama  ] the potential for reaching a political agreement regarding [LOC Japan  ] 's whaling practices . 
Background: <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG Department of Commerce Principal Deputy Undersecretary for Oceans  ] and [ORG Atmosphere Monica  ] [PER Medina  ] traveled to [LOC Tokyo  ] to meet with [ORG GOJ  ] officials November 3-5 . 
At a private meeting with State Secretary [PER Tetsuro Fukuyama  ] , [PER Ms. Medina  ] requested political commitment from the new leadership in [LOC Japan  ] to work with the [LOC United States  ] to transform the [ORG International Whaling Commission  ] so that it can better accomplish its objectives to conserve whales and manage whale stocks . 
In particular , the Governments of [LOC Japan  ] and the [LOC United States  ] would work towards reaching an understanding regarding a way forward for the [ORG International Whaling Commission  ] that would include a meaningful reduction in [LOC Japan  ] 's current whaling levels and [LOC U.S.  ] support for international approval of sustainable small-type coastal whaling activities off the coast of [LOC Japan  ] . 
In addition , the [ORG GOJ  ] would no longer hunt fin or humpback whales in the [LOC Southern Ocean  ] , and the [LOC United States  ] would uphold domestic and international laws to ensure safety at sea and encourage other governments to do the same . 
[PER Ms. Medina  ] provided a draft statement outlining these objectives to Post . 
Action Request: <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Post , at the highest possible level , is requested to discuss reform of the [ORG IWC  ] with State Secretary [PER Fukuyama  ] and other political appointees within the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] or [ORG Ministry of Agriculture  ] , [LOC Forestry  ] , and Fisheries in a position to influence the [ORG GOJ  ] 's actions on this topic . 
Post may draw upon the following talking points during these discussions: - The [ORG International Whaling Commission  ] ( [ORG IWC  ] ) has not functioned effectively for many years due to the polarized views of its members . 
Previous efforts to resolve conflicts within the organization have not succeeded. - The conflicts have at times become an irritant in the relations among the nations concerned , including the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Japan  ] . 
They have also undermined whale conservation and management by the [LOC IWC.  ] - The new administrations in [LOC Japan  ] and the [LOC United States  ] have a unique opportunity to chart a different course for the [ORG IWC  ] , and resolve our long-standing disagreements through fundamental reform of the [ORG IWC  ] . 
This is a small issue but it is important to the [ORG Obama Administration  ] that it be resolved quickly. - Most recently , a small [ORG Support Group  ] of [ORG IWC  ] member nations , including [LOC Japan  ] and the [LOC United States  ] , met in October 2009 in [LOC Santiago  ] , [LOC Chile  ] . 
The [LOC United States  ] is pleased by the significant progress made toward a possible interim agreement that would set overall whale catches at a reduced level while longer term negotiations continue . 
We nevertheless recognize that work needs to be done to bridge remaining differences on a key issue. - Although all [ORG IWC  ] members will ultimately share responsibility for the success or failure of this process , the approach taken by [LOC Japan  ] in the immediate future will have a major impact on the likelihood of success. - The [LOC United States  ] strongly urges [LOC Japan  ] to join with other [ORG IWC  ] members who have shown willingness to compromise in the short term in order to reach the long-term goal of a normalized [ORG IWC  ] . 
STATE 00117709 002.2 OF 002 - We fully appreciate that , for these negotiations to be concluded successfully , all participants will need to show maximum flexibility . 
If agreement on some reduction in [LOC Japan  ] 's catch levels can be reached , the [LOC United States  ] believes that an overall interim agreement would be within reach. - The [LOC United States  ] stands ready to work with [LOC Japan  ] and all other [ORG IWC  ] members toward such an interim agreement . 
We understand that there is an important related issue regarding safety at sea of the [MISC Japanese  ] research vessels that must also be addressed. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) The [ORG Department  ] thanks [ORG Embassy Tokyo  ] in advance for its cooperation on this matter . 
Additionally , the [ORG Department wishes  ] to thank [ORG Embassy Tokyo  ] for the assistance and time provided to [PER Ms. Medina  ] during her recent visit to [LOC Tokyo  ] , particularly in light of the upcoming Presidential visit . 
The [ORG Department  ] 's point of contact on this matter is [ORG Ms. Elizabeth Phelps  ] , reachable at 202-647-0241 or via email at phelpse@state.gov .
