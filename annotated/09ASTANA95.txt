END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( SBU ) [ORG U.S. Central Command Commander  ] General [PER David Petraeus  ] met with Kazakhstan’s President [PER Nursultan Nazarbayev  ] on January 14 for twice the scheduled time , 70 minutes . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] side included Major General [PER Robert Allardice  ] ( CENTCOM J5 ) , POLAD [PER Michael Gfoeller  ] , and the Ambassador ( note taker ) . 
[ORG Security Council  ] Secretary [PER Kaibek Suleymenov  ] , Presidential Foreign Policy Adviser [PER Khairat Sarybay  ] , and [PER Magzhan Ilyassov  ] of the presidential administration accompanied President [PER Nazarbayev  ] . 
[LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) General [PER Petraeus  ] thanked President [PER Nazarbayev  ] for the recent formal ratification of the long-existing over-flight and divert agreements , as well as for Kazakhstan’s willingness to participate in the [ORG Northern Distribution Network for Operation Enduring Freedom  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
He briefed the president on [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Nazarbayev  ] responded , “Afghanistan greatly worries us . 
I am often in touch with ( [LOC Afghanistan  ] President [PER Hamid  ] ) [PER Karzai  ] . 
He says the situation is good and the economy is growing ; but I know he controls only 30% of his territory , and if the [MISC Afghan  ] economy is growing , it’s based on drugs . 
We are already providing humanitarian and reconstruction assistance , but we need better security in [LOC Afghanistan  ] if we are to do more . 
The [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Kazakhstan  ] have a common interest in strengthening [PER Afghanistan.” Nazarbayev  ] said he knows [PER Karzai  ] wants to involve the [ORG Taliban  ] in his government and commented , “That would be greatly dangerous.” General [PER Petraeus  ] explained that Karzai’s position is more nuanced: the goal would be to break up the [ORG Taliban  ] and reconcile some , “but we have no illusion that [PER Mullah Omar  ] could ever join the government.” [PER Nazarbayev  ] replied , “If there’s a chance to break up the [ORG Taliban  ] , that’s fine ; but the [ORG Taliban  ] leadership will never change its position.” <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) [PER Nazarbayev  ] told General [PER Petraeus  ] , “You’re aware of [MISC Afghan  ] history ; no foreign country ever succeeded in invasion . 
[MISC Afghans  ] have to govern themselves.” Calling the situation in [LOC Afghanistan  ] “very complicated , ” [PER Nazarbayev  ] said he knows some the potential candidates to succeed [PER Karzai  ] , but none of them could unify and lead [LOC Afghanistan.  ] “Karzai is weak , but it’s better to keep him on.” [PER Nazarbayev  ] added he’s heard [PER Karzai  ] claim the [ORG Taliban  ] are trained in [LOC Pakistan  ] and said he accepts that as credible . 
[PER Nazarbayev  ] added [LOC Central Asia  ] needs a common policy on [LOC Afghanistan  ] , “but that hasn’t happened.” He alluded to Uzbekistan’s support for the ethnic [MISC Uzbek  ] leader [PER Dostum  ] . 
[LOC IRAN  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) [PER Nazarbayev  ] judged that [LOC Iran  ] is a problem in the region , and General [PER Petraeus  ] fully agreed . 
[PER Nazarbayev  ] said , “I have good contacts among the leadership in [LOC Iran  ] . 
I’ve tried to explain to them that [LOC Kazakhstan  ] was once nuclear but [ORG ASTANA  ] 00000095 002 OF 003 fully gave up that status . 
I tell them it would be to their benefit to be non-nuclear . 
That would draw new assistance and investment.” General [PER Petraeus  ] said he again fully agreed with the president , but noted Iran’s policy is determined by the [ORG Revolutional Guard al-Quds Force  ] commander , not by President [PER Ahmedinejad  ] or the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] . 
[PER Nazarbayev  ] noted he had once talked to [PER Ahmedinejad  ] for two and a half hours about such issues , “but in the end I realized I had just wasted my time.” He said Supreme Leader [PER Ayatollah Khameni  ] told him that even if [LOC Iran  ] compromises on the nuclear issue , the [LOC United States  ] would always find another reason to criticize “because they hate us -- all the [LOC United States  ] wants is to conquer the entire region and steal the oil.” General [PER Petraeus  ] interjected , “We could have bought all the oil in the region for 100 years for what we’ve spent in [LOC Iraq  ] ! ” [PER Nazarbayev  ] , looking a bit amused , said , “I know . 
I’m just telling you what he said.” Without specifying his interlocutor , [PER Nazarbayev  ] said he’d asked if [LOC Tehran  ] is willing to talk to the [LOC United States  ] , “and they said yes . 
I conveyed this to President-elect [PER Obama  ] during our ( post-U.S. election ) phone call.” General [PER Petraeus  ] commented the [LOC United States  ] had had three rounds of talks with [LOC Iran  ] about [LOC Iraq  ] but had gotten nowhere . 
[PER Nazarbayev  ] said , “I have no illusion [LOC U.S.  ] negotiations with [LOC Iran  ] would be easy or fast , but we cannot let [LOC Iran  ] have nuclear weapons . 
I want to be helpful with [MISC Iran.”  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) [PER Nazarbayev  ] added he has discussed Iran’s nuclear ambitions with [MISC Russian  ] President [PER Medvedev  ] and Prime Minister [PER Putin:  ] “I emphasize to them a nuclear [LOC Iran  ] is in no one’s interests.” General [PER Petraeus  ] responded that it’s important to get [LOC Russia  ] to be helpful with [MISC Iran:  ] “They seem conflicted . 
Sometimes they help ; sometimes they send weapons.” [PER Nazarbayev  ] said , “I told [PER Obama  ] that he has a good chance to have good relations with [MISC Mevedev  ] . 
That’s important for us , too , since [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC Kazakhstan  ] are neighbors.” [LOC RUSSIA  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) General [PER Petraeus  ] told President [PER Nazarbayev  ] Kazakhstan’s special relationship with [LOC Russia  ] is not a problem for the [LOC United States.  ] “It’s not a zero-sum game for us . 
You can have good relations with [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC China  ] as well as with us.” [PER Nazarbayev  ] said he fully agreed , adding , “I tell [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC China  ] we have our own resources . 
We are [MISC Kazakhs  ] . 
We were colonized for over 500 years , first by the [PER Golden Horde  ] , then by the western [MISC Chinese  ] , then by [LOC Russia  ] . 
We’ve been independent for only 17 years , and we do not want to be colonized again . 
We will never be ‘under’ [LOC Russia  ] or [LOC China  ] . 
We have enough resources and a reasonably educated population to make our own choices . 
We want stability , development , and cooperation . 
We all have to have [LOC Russia  ] ‘inside the tent.’ [ORG I’d  ] like the [LOC United States  ] and the [ORG European Union  ] to help with this.” <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) [PER Nazarbayev  ] said the [LOC West  ] had made real mistakes after the collapse of the [LOC Soviet Union  ] by not treating [PER Yeltsin  ] with respect . 
He said [PER Yeltsin  ] had once gone to the [ORG NATO-Russia Council  ] where he had been “teased.” [PER Nazarbayev  ] explained [LOC Russia  ] has great , but now injured , pride . 
It was once a great empire , and [MISC Russian  ] soldiers had played a large role in winning the [ORG Great Patriotic War  ] ( [ORG WW II  ] ) , but the [LOC West  ] seems to refuse to understand this . 
For [LOC Russia  ] , maintained [PER Nazarbayev  ] , “face” is everything . 
[PER Nazarbayev  ] said he had frequently told President [PER Medvedev  ] that being an energy superpower is not enough ; it’s essential to develop international leadership with a spirit of cooperation . 
[PER Nazarbayev  ] said [PER Medvedev  ] was “almost there , ” but then the “Georgia mistake happened.” [PER Nazarbayev  ] concluded , “If the new [LOC U.S.  ] administration has a wise response to [LOC Russia  ] , [ORG I’d  ] be glad to help” with the relationship. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) NOTE: While waiting for [PER Nazarbayev  ] to enter the meeting room , General [PER Petraeus  ] ask Foreign Policy Adviser Sarybay why [LOC Kazakhstan  ] had moved its capital from [LOC Almaty  ] to [ORG ASTANA  ] 00000095 003 OF 003 [ORG Astana  ] . 
Sarybay answered , “There are probably 20 different reasons people give . 
In fact , in the first few years of independence , several maps appeared that made our northern border unclear , and so the President ‘planted the flag.’” This is the first time we are aware that a senior official has confirmed [PER Nazarbayev  ] moved his capital to prevent [MISC Russian  ] nationalists from annexing the northern third of [LOC Kazakhstan  ] , which hotheads , including some in the [LOC Duma  ] at that time , claimed was historically part of [LOC Russia  ] . 
END NOTE. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) COMMENT: [PER Nazarbayev  ] looked as fit as ever and was very well-briefed , discussing details of the [MISC U.S.-Kazakhstan  ] military relationship without notes . 
He was not shy that he sees himself as an international statesman . 
We know he was genuinely pleased with President-elect [PER Obama’s  ] telephone call , and we judge his offers to be helpful for the [LOC United States  ] with [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Russia  ] are genuine . 
END COMMENT. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) General [PER Petraeus  ] has cleared this cable .
