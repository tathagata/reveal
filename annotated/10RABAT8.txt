[PER Konate  ] departed [LOC Rabat  ] after meeting with [PER A/S Carson  ] and was expected to make a public pronouncement in the near future in [LOC Guinea  ] announcing his intention to lead the transition to civilian rule ( [PER Ref A  ] ) . <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 .

[MISC French  ] Foreign Minister [PER Bernard Kouchner  ] planned to ask [MISC Congolese  ] President [PER Denis Sassou-Nguesso  ] if the [LOC Republic of the Congo  ] would host [PER Dadis  ] , and the [ORG GOM  ] requested that we reinforce that message . 
Finally , the [ORG GOM  ] indicated that it would be willing to participate in an international contact group meeting on [LOC Guinea  ] in [LOC Addis Ababa  ] on January 26 and would mobilize [MISC Arab  ] support -- if an organization other than the [ORG African Union  ] ( [ORG AU  ] ) convened the meeting . 
End Summary. ----------------------- [MISC Moroccans  ] Set the Stage ----------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Prior to meeting with [PER Konate  ] , [PER A/S Carson  ] met on January 5 with [MISC Moroccan  ] Foreign Minister [PER Fassi Fihri  ] and [MISC Moroccan  ] Director General for [ORG Studies and Documentation  ] ( external intelligence service chief ) [PER Mohamed Yassine Mansouri  ] , the de facto national security advisor . 
Also in attendance were [MISC Moroccan  ] [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] Director General for [ORG Multilateral Affairs  ] and Chief of Staff Ambassador [PER Nasser Bourita  ] , Ambassador , DCM , and [MISC D/PolCouns  ] . 
[ORG French Presidential Advisor for African Affairs  ] [PER Andre Parant  ] had met with the [MISC Moroccans  ] and with [PER Konate  ] on January 4 , and [PER A/S Carson  ] subsequently briefed [MISC French  ] Ambassador [PER Bruno Joubert.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Emphasizing [LOC Morocco  ] , s goal of finding a way to stabilize the situation in [LOC Conakry  ] , [PER Fassi Fihri  ] reported that in the past few days [PER Konate  ] had asserted his readiness to begin the political transition in [LOC Guinea  ] . 
[PER Konate  ] had told the [MISC Moroccans  ] that he would not name a Prime Minister but would ask [MISC Guinean  ] civil society , including the political parties and the labor unions , to identify a leader until elections could be held . 
[PER Fassi Fihri  ] added that [PER Konate  ] recognized the inseparability of military and political affairs and the need to disarm the militias and restructure [MISC Guinean  ] armed forces . 
[PER Konate  ] needed , however , the commitment of support from [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC Paris  ] , and [LOC Rabat  ] , evidenced by signature of the declaration , to move forward , [PER Fassi Fihri  ] said. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Fassi Fihri  ] went on to explain that [PER Konate  ] saw the restructuring of the military as a three-to-five year process [LOC RABAT  ] 00000008 002.2 OF 004 before the country could claim to have a professional army . 
[PER Konate  ] wished that violence and bloodshed such as seen in [LOC Guinea  ] and elsewhere on the continent would " never happen again , " and he recognized the need for those responsible , from [PER Dadis  ] to the lowest ranking accomplice , to be brought to justice either through [MISC Guinean  ] courts or , if not credible , through an international tribunal , [PER Fassi Fihri  ] reported . 
As for the document expressing [MISC French  ] , [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Moroccan  ] support for [PER Konate  ] , [ORG French Presidential Advisor for African Affairs  ] [PER Andre Parant  ] had already signed it . 
[PER Fassi Fihri  ] said [PER Konate  ] would " keep it in his pocket " but needed the written assurance of support. ------------- The [LOC U.S.  ] Role ------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER A/S Carson  ] and the Ambassador expressed appreciation for the [ORG GOM  ] 's leadership on the issue and in the region , noting the urgent need to set [LOC Guinea  ] on the path to stability and civilian rule . 
While recognizing the importance of military restructuring , [PER A/S Carson  ] stressed the need to address [LOC Guinea  ] 's economic situation as well by working to develop a strategy for the country 's economic revitalization . 
Specifically , [PER A/S Carson  ] suggested that the [LOC United States  ] could seek the establishment of an international contact group that would encourage economic assistance to [LOC Guinea  ] , engaging the [ORG World Bank  ] and the [ORG IMF  ] as well . 
He noted too that [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Africa Command  ] could visit [LOC Guinea  ] to assess the security sector and make recommendations on security sector reform. ------------ Enter [PER Konate  ] ------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) After more than one hour , [MISC Guinean  ] Minister of [ORG National Defense Sekouba Konate  ] , who had been waiting nearby , joined the meeting . 
[PER A/S Carson  ] thanked him for sharing concerns about the future of [LOC Guinea  ] and applauded his efforts to resolve the situation in the country . 
He stated that [LOC Guinea  ] is at a crossroads and that [PER Konate  ] 's leadership was of crucial importance and could help ensure the country moved along the road to stability and progress . 
[PER A/S Carson  ] stressed that it was important for the transition to begin and to lead in the shortest possible time to new elections , adding that it was similarly important that [PER Dadis  ] not return and participate in elections . 
Likewise , it would be beneficial for [PER Konate  ] to facilitate the presence in [LOC Guinea  ] of a small [ORG ECOWAS  ] monitoring group consisting of 30 to 40 diplomats and unarmed military personnel , which would lend credibility to the transition process . 
[PER A/S Carson  ] noted there was much international goodwill toward [LOC Guinea  ] , and if the country chose the path toward stability , economic development , and civilian government , there would be help along the way. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Konate  ] expressed his appreciation for [PER A/S Carson  ] 's message and repeated the importance of having the signed document verifying support for his efforts . 
He repeatedly expressed concern for his own security and for the security of his country , but stated his readiness to return to [LOC Conakry  ] and put the [LOC Ouagadougou  ] Accords in place . 
It was important to begin , he said , adding that the violent events of September 28 could be repeated if efforts were not made to prevent violence . 
[PER Konate  ] stated explicitly that he would engage the [ORG Forces Vives  ] and others in support of the transition and that he would not be a candidate in any future elections . 
[LOC RABAT  ] 00000008 003.2 OF 004 <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Konate  ] also stated that he supported a civilian government of national unity and suggested that opposition leader [PER Jean Marie Dore  ] serve as Prime Minister until elections were held but asserted in this regard that he would accept the decision of the opposition . 
[PER Konate  ] said the military would agree to his role in leading the transition , and he agreed it would be important to show that the army was not engaged in politics . 
[PER Claude Pivi  ] ( [PER Dadis  ] 's half-brother ) and others closely affiliated with [PER Dadis Camara  ] and the junta would similarly be excluded from participating in the transition . 
[PER Pivi  ] was involved in the September 28 massacre , [PER Konate  ] said , and should go to court ( Ref A ) . -------------- Whither [PER Dadis  ] ? -------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Carson  ] did not meet with [PER Dadis Camara  ] , but discussed his health with the [MISC Moroccans  ] outside of [PER Konate  ] , s presence . 
[PER Fassi Fihri  ] told [PER A/S Carson  ] that he has visited [PER Dadis  ] four times since he was allowed into the country for medical care ( Ref B ) . 
According to the [ORG FM  ] , [PER Dadis  ] has regained " 80 percent " of his faculties , but has difficulty putting more than five words together without 30-second pauses before the next phrase or sentence . 
[PER Fassi Fihri  ] , s conversations with [PER Dadis  ] had focused mainly on health issues , the [ORG FM  ] said , with [PER Fassi Fihri  ] urging him to fully recover before thinking about politics and his future . 
[PER Dadis  ] has , however , expressed the desire to leave , [PER Fassi Fihri  ] said , and has begun to wonder why he has not been discharged from the hospital. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Fassi Fihri  ] and [PER Mansouri  ] suggested that once [PER Konate  ] made his public pronouncement , [PER Dadis  ] would know he was finished politically and it would be difficult for him to return to [LOC Guinea  ] . 
Concerted engagement by [PER Konate  ] with political forces inside [LOC Guinea  ] , and by the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC France  ] with external forces such as [ORG ECOWAS  ] and President [PER Blaise Compaore  ] , to enlist support for [PER Konate  ] and his leadership though a transitional period and their positive reaction to a pronouncement would convince [PER Dadis  ] to go to a third country , [PER Fassi Fihri  ] said . 
[PER Konate  ] was explicit that [PER Dadis  ] not be allowed to return to [LOC Guinea  ] and participate in the transition. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) A/S [PER Carson  ] outlined [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to identify a country to house [PER Dadis Camara  ] for the long term , noting that [LOC Gabon  ] , [LOC Senegal  ] , [LOC Burkina Faso  ] and [LOC Libya  ] have been considered . 
[PER Fassi Fihri  ] suggested that The [LOC Gambia  ] or the [LOC Republic of  ] the [LOC Congo  ] ( [ORG Brazzaville  ] ) might be other options. -------------- The [ORG Road Ahead  ] -------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) After [PER A/S Carson  ] relayed to [ORG ECOWAS  ] facilitator [PER Blaise Compaore  ] the contents of the meetings , [PER Compaore  ] expressed his gratitude for the efforts and noted that this could help break the impasse in [LOC Guinea  ] . 
However , he noted that [PER Pivi  ] seemed to be running the show in [LOC Guinea  ] and asked rhetorically if [PER Konate  ] would be able to bring the factions together or whether a [PER Konate  ] pronouncement would bring greater instability . 
The real issue for [PER Compaore  ] was whether [PER Konate  ] would be able to command the support of the military . 
[PER Konate  ] 's stated intention was to move the country along the path to economic progress and civilian rule . 
[PER Konate  ] departed [LOC Rabat  ] for [LOC Conakry  ] on January 5. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) On January 7 , King [PER Mohammed VI  ] called [MISC Gabonese  ] President [PER Ali Bongo  ] to request that [LOC Gabon  ] host [PER Dadis Camara  ] ; according to [PER Bourita  ] , [PER Bongo  ] declined . 
[MISC French  ] Foreign Minister [PER Bernard Kouchner  ] planned to ask [MISC Congolese  ] President [LOC RABAT  ] 00000008 004.2 OF 004 [PER Denis Sassou-Nguesso  ] if the [LOC Republic of  ] the [LOC Congo  ] would host [PER Dadis  ] , and the [ORG GOM  ] requested that we reinforce that message . 
[PER Bourita  ] told [ORG DCM  ] that [LOC Morocco  ] it would be willing to participate in an international contact group meeting on [LOC Guinea  ] in [LOC Addis Ababa  ] on January 26 and would mobilize [MISC Arab  ] support -- if an organization other than the [ORG African Union  ] ( [ORG AU  ] ) convened the meeting . 
Having the [ORG AU  ] convene is unacceptable to [LOC Morocco  ] because [LOC Morocco  ] is not a member. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Carson  ] , s trip was very productive and clearly led to forward movement . 
[PER Konate  ] , who spoke very softly , repeated several times that he was concerned about his personal security . 
For its part , the [ORG GOM  ] is anxious to 1 ) get [PER Dadis Camara  ] out of [LOC Morocco  ] and 2 ) continue to support the transition and reconstruction processes in [LOC Guinea  ] . 
End Comment. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( U ) A/S [PER Carson  ] cleared paragraphs 1 and 3 through 13. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 .
