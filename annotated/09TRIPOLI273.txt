REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: Rescuers have saved nearly 400 migrants from disabled and capsized vessels off [LOC Libya  ] 's coast , although over 20 bodies have been recovered and another 100-200 people are feared lost at sea . 
According to the [MISC Italian  ] Embassy , [MISC Italian  ] authorities received the distress call on March 29 . 
Despite arrangements outlined in Search and Rescue Agreements with both [LOC Italy  ] and [LOC Malta  ] , [MISC Libyan  ] officials did not immediately respond . 
The boats were disabled near the [LOC Bouri  ] offshore drilling platforms , equipped with supply ships that were pressed into service to rescue victims in the water and tow a disabled vessel to [LOC Tripoli  ] harbor . 
Survivors are being held in two immigrant detention centers and a [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG NGO  ] is providing humanitarian assistance . 
The Government of [LOC Libya  ] ( [ORG GOL  ] ) has begun to contact embassies and international organizations to identify and repatriate the rescued migrants . 
End Summary . 
ONE SHIP CAPSIZED , ONE DISABLED BUT UPRIGHT 2 . 
( C ) The latest tragedy to befall migrants attempting the maritime crossing from [LOC Libya  ] to [MISC European  ] shores began to unfold in the early hours of March 29 , according to contacts at the [MISC Italian  ] embassy . 
[MISC Italian  ] officials received a distress call from a disabled ship near the ENI-operated [LOC Bouri  ] oil platform ( roughly north of [LOC Zwara  ] , [LOC Libya  ] ) . 
After determining that the ship was in [MISC Libyan  ] waters , [LOC Italy  ] attempted to notify the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Coast Guard  ] following protocols set by the two nations in a recent " friendship treaty " ( ref A ) . 
Unable to make direct contact , [LOC Rome  ] then alerted its embassy in [LOC Tripoli  ] , which in turn notified counterparts within the [ORG GOL  ] . 
[MISC Italian  ] diplomats here characterized [LOC Libya  ] 's initial response as sluggish , but noted that a small [MISC Libyan  ] patrol boat made contact with a disabled ship carrying a reported 356 individuals . 
Unable to take the migrants aboard or tow them to safety , the [MISC Libyans  ] pressed an [MISC Italian  ] ship - contracted by [ORG ENI  ] to supply its offshore platform - into service to tug the seaworthy but unpowered vessel to [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
In the course of that rescue , victims of another vessel carrying migrants were found in the water . 
Twenty-three migrants were rescued from the water and another 20 drowned bodies were recovered from the wreckage , but witnesses from among the rescued put the original manifest at 257 . 
3 . 
( C ) [ORG BBC News  ] reported that [MISC Libyan  ] officials have called off the search for survivors . 
The [MISC Italian  ] embassy reported that two additional boats may have set off with the two stricken vessels . 
The [ORG GOL  ] claims two ships are " legitimate fishing vessels " not carrying migrants , but concedes that they have no contact with either boat leading some to speculate the death count may be higher still . 
Television pictures emerging showed the towed vessel 's return to [LOC Tripoli  ] harbor . 
The daily [ORG Oyea newspaper  ] reported that as many as 250 migrants may be declared lost at sea . 
4 . 
( C ) According to the [ORG International Organization for Migration  ] ( [ORG IOM  ] ) , the 356 rescued from the disabled ship have been sent to two detention centers approximately 50km west of [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
The [ORG International Organization for Peace  ] , Care , and Relief ( [ORG IOPCR  ] ) - a quasi-NGO facilitating both [ORG IOM  ] and [ORG UNHCR  ] 's work in [LOC Libya  ] - is reportedly providing humanitarian assistance , including food , blankets , and mattresses . 
Rescued nationalities include [MISC Indian  ] , [MISC Pakistani  ] , [MISC Bangladeshi  ] , [MISC Eritrean  ] , [MISC Somali  ] , [MISC Syrian  ] , [MISC Ghanaian  ] , and [MISC Egyptian  ] . 
The [ORG GOL  ] has contacted consular officials of the nationals rescued to begin the process of identifying and potentially repatriating victims to their countries of origin . 
[ORG IOM  ] expects to play a significant role in the repatriation efforts . 
[LOC LIBYA  ] RESPONSIVE TO [MISC ITALIAN  ] REQUESTS , THOUGH OUTSIDE OF AGREED PROTOCOLS 5 . 
( C ) These tragic deaths and dramatic rescue come within weeks of two Search and Rescue ( [ORG SAR  ] ) agreements [LOC Libya  ] has signed with [MISC European  ] neighbors . 
The [MISC Libyan-Italian  ] " friendship treaty " included language calling on [LOC Libya  ] to implement earlier agreements to conduct joint patrols and respond to [MISC Italian  ] notifications of both imperiled and unidentified migrants within [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000273 002.2 OF 002 [MISC Libyan  ] territorial waters ( ref B ) . 
The [MISC Maltese  ] Ambassador in [LOC Tripoli  ] , whose government signed an [ORG MOU  ] with [LOC Libya  ] on March 18 outlining each country 's [ORG SAR  ] responsibilities ( ref C ) , has previously complained to us that that the [MISC Libyan  ] operations center responsible for managing response to maritime search , rescue , and interdiction would not answer the phone or respond to fax requests - even when the [ORG EU  ] provided satellite tracking data . 
After a delay signing the [ORG MOU  ] last October , the exasperated [MISC Maltese  ] Ambassador told [PER Poloff  ] that the agreement called for little more than a pledge from [LOC Libya  ] " to pick up the phone " . 
The [MISC Italian  ] Embassy reported similar lack of responsiveness in this case , which eventually improved after Embassy prodding . 
RESCUE HIGHLIGHTS SHIFTING TREND IN MIGRATION PATTERNS , LITTLE SLOWDOWN DUE TO [ORG EU  ] ECONOMY 6 . 
( C ) Comment: Photographs of the disabled vessel towed into harbor show that it was heavily laden with passengers . 
The recent trend here has been toward smaller , faster boats that attempt to slip through [ORG EU  ] patrols and land migrants at [LOC Lampedusa  ] or [LOC Malta  ] . 
With larger vessels , smugglers hope only to get to [ORG EU  ] waters , where they then disable the boat 's engine and call in the [ORG SOS  ] via satellite phone to the [MISC Italian  ] or [MISC Maltese  ] authorities - an approach that observers say puts lives at greater risk if conditions turn against a stranded ship . 
It is unclear why one of the boats capsized ; an [MISC Italian  ] military attache' described calm seas near the site of the rescue on March 29 and 30 . 
While precise numbers are unavailable , migration experts here see a recent uptick in the number of migrants attempting the perilous trip to [LOC Europe  ] despite the slowdown in the [ORG EU  ] economy . 
An [ORG IOM  ] project manager speculated that the weaker economy actually made transit less expensive for migrants as smugglers were willing to take lower fees due to the recession .
