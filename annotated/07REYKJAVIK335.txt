THE AMBASSADOR WAS CALLED IN BY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS GISLADOTTIR ON DECEMBER 13 TO HEAR ICELANDIC CONCERNS REGARDING THE CASE OF ERLA OSK ARNARDOTTIR , WHO WAS DETAINED BY [LOC U.S.  ] IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES FOR ALMOST 24 HOURS FOLLOWING HER ARRIVAL AT [LOC JFK  ] AIRPORT DECEMBER 9 ( SEPTEL ) . 
SAYING SHE HAD SPOKEN AT [LOC LENGTH  ] TO MS. ARNARDOTTIR EARLIER TODAY , GISLADOTTIR SAID SHE WAS SHOCKED BY WHAT SHE SAID WAS THE GROSSLY INAPPROPRIATE TREATMENT OF MS. ARNARDOTTIR BY [LOC U.S.  ] IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES . 
THE MINISTER DESCRIBED MS. ARNARDOTTIR'S EXPERIENCE , WHICH REPORTEDLY INCLUDED CONFINEMENT , ISOLATION , AND BEING HAULED IN SHACKLES AND HANDCUFFS THROUGH PUBLIC AREAS OF [LOC JFK  ] , AS INHUMANE AND DEGRADING . 
SHE SAID THE EXPERIENCE HAD LEFT MS. ARNARDOTTIR HUMILIATED AND OUTRAGED. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
THE FOREIGN MINISTER NOTED THAT THE CASE HAS GENERATED WIDE INTEREST ALL OVER THE COUNTRY . 
THE ICELANDIC PUBLIC IS BOTH APPALLED AND ANGRY . 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN FLOODED WITH PHONE CALLS AND E-MAILS FROM CITIZENS PROTESTING THIS PARTICULAR CASE OR REGISTERING COMPLAINTS OF THEIR OWN ABOUT PROBLEMS CROSSING THE [LOC U.S.  ] BORDER . 
GISLADOTTIR WARNED THAT THE DAMAGE TO THE [LOC U.S.  ] PUBLIC IMAGE WAS SEVERE . 
SHE SAID AN OFFICIAL APOLOGY FROM THE USG WAS DUE. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
[ORG THE  ] AMBASSADOR REPLIED THAT THE [LOC U.S.  ] WELCOMES MILLIONS OF GUESTS A YEAR AND WE TAKE IT SERIOUSLY WHEN VISITORS TO OUR COUNTRY REPORT THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN TREATED APPROPRIATELY BY [LOC U.S.  ] OFFICIALS . 
SHE SAID THE EMBASSY HAS ALREADY RAISED THE CASE WITH THE [LOC U.S.  ] CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION AUTHORITIES AT THE AIRPORT , AS WELL AS WITH DHS HEADQUARTERS . 
WE HAVE ASKED CBP FOR A FULL REPORT OF MS. ARNARDOTTIR'S DETENTION . 
THE AMBASSADOR ASSURED THE FORMIN THAT WE WOULD INFORM THE GOI OF THE RESULTS OF [ORG THE INQUIRY.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
[ORG THE  ] FOREIGN MINISTER WELCOMED [ORG THE INVESTIGATION  ] , WHICH SHE HOPED WOULD BE CONCLUDED SWIFTLY . 
SHE ADDED , HOWEVER , THAT IF [ORG THE INVESTIGATION  ] SHOWED THAT MS. ARNARDOTTIR HAD IN FACT BEEN HANDLED ACCORDING TO [ORG THE CBP'S STANDARD POLICY  ] , THEN IT WAS HER GOVERNMENT'S OPINION THAT [ORG THE U.S.  ] BORDER PROTOCOL RAISED TROUBLING QUESTIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE . 
GISLADOTTIR SAID THE GOI TOOK [ORG THE POSITION  ] THAT [ORG THE TREATMENT  ] OF MS. ARNARDOTTIR , WHOSE OFFENSE WAS UNWITTING AND WHO POSED NO DANGER TO [ORG THE U.S.  ] , SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN [ORG THE SAME AS  ] THAT OF A DANGEROUS CRIMINAL. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
EMBASSY COMMENT: GISLADOTTIR , WHO HAS PUT HUMAN RIGHTS AT THE TOP OF [ORG THE MFA'S  ] ACTION LIST , WAS CLEARLY BOTH PERTURBED AND ENGAGED . 
( NOTE: SHE TOLD [ORG THE PRESS  ] JUST PRIOR TO [ORG THE MEETING  ] THAT SHE WOULD ASK FOR AN APOLOGY ; SHE ALSO MET WITH [ORG THE PRESS  ] IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING [ORG THE MEETING  ] . 
) WE SHARE HER ASSESSMENT THAT THIS INCIDENT --REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENED -- IS A SERIOUS BLOW TO THE [LOC U.S.  ] IMAGE IN [LOC ICELAND  ] . 
HEAVY PUBLICITY HAS ENSURED THE CASE IS THE TALK OF THE COUNTRY . 
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THE STORY OFF THE FRONT PAGES BY SORTING OUT THE DETAILS OF THE DETENTION AND REPORTING BACK TO THE GOVERNMENT OF [LOC ICELAND  ] AS SOON AS POSSIBLE . 
THE FOREIGN MINISTER AS WELL AS THE PRIME MINISTER ARE PERSONALLY INVOLVED IN THE ISSUE AND ARE NOT LIKELY TO LET IT SLIDE .
