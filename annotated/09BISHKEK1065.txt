Gfoeller  ] , for Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: In a wide-ranging lunch , [PER Maxim Bakiyev  ] , son of President [PER Bakiyev  ] , and [MISC Kyrgyz  ] FM [PER Sarbaev  ] argued that the $20 million [ORG Economic Development Fund  ] needs to be a new kind of assistance , targeted strategically toward the development of the country and its integration into the world economy . 
[PER Bakiyev  ] described [MISC Russian  ] machinations against the [LOC U.S.  ] and his own intelligence efforts against the [MISC Russians  ] , complained about personal attacks on him by an organization connected to the [ORG National Democratic Institute  ] , and stated that the [MISC Russians  ] have not come through with the $2 billion they had promised for the [ORG Kamburata  ] 2 hydroelectric project . 
[PER Bakiyev  ] came across as very pro-U.S. , well educated , and dedicated to the betterment of his country . 
Of course , we have information from many other sources suggesting that he is also very dedicated to his own advancement and corrupt financial interests . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Ambassador and DCM had lunch with [PER Maxim Bakiyev  ] , the son of President [PER Bakiyev  ] and Foreign Minister [PER Kadyrbek Sarbaev  ] on September 18 , at the invitation of the Foreign Minister . 
[LOC Plov  ] , [LOC Manti  ] and other [MISC Central Asian  ] delicacies were served at one of the guest houses on the Presidential compound . 
The tone of the hosts was extremely warm and friendly , and the conversation was open and wide ranging . 
[MISC Russian  ] Meddling ---------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Sarbaev  ] and the Ambassador began with a short discussion of the delivery , the day before , of the [ORG Department of Defense  ] check for $250,000 to [PER Marina Ivanova  ] , the widow of the man killed in the [LOC Hatfield  ] case . 
The Ambassador thanked [PER Sarbaev  ] for facilitating delivery of the check . 
[PER Bakiyev  ] noted that the [MISC Russians  ] had played an unhelpful role with [PER Mrs. Ivanova  ] . 
He said they had met with her in July and tried to convince her to come out in the press again to denounce the [LOC U.S.  ] and call again for the closing of the [LOC U.S.  ] base . 
[MISC Kyrgyz  ] officials had then met with her , he said , and convinced her that it was not in her interests to become a pawn in a fight between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Bakiyev  ] followed up by noting that the [MISC Russians  ] play an unhelpful role in many issues . 
However , he said , " I have my own very good computer experts , and we are able to intercept and read [ORG FSB  ] communications . 
" In that way , he said , they keep abreast of what the [MISC Russians  ] are doing . 
He said that he had read intercepts from the [ORG FSB  ] regarding his own efforts to put together a team of experts to study the needs of the country ( further described in para 8 below ) . 
The [MISC Russians  ] had concluded that the [MISC Americans  ] must be behind the effort , as it was too well put together to be [MISC Kyrgyz  ] , he said , commenting that the [MISC Russians  ] are racist in their view of the [MISC Kyrgyz  ] . 
And Democracy Activists Meddling , Too ------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) There were also problematic people within [LOC Kyrgyzstan  ] , [PER Bakiyev  ] said . 
Just a few months ago articles attacking him personally began appearing on the website compromat.ru . 
His computer people had been able to trace them back to " purported " democracy activist [PER Tolekan Ismailova  ] , director of the [ORG Human Rights Center  ] " [ORG Citizens  ] against [ORG Corruption  ] " which receives grants from the [ORG National Democratic Institute  ] of the [LOC U.S  ] . 
( [PER Ismailova  ] was arrested and released on July 30 , 2009 for protesting the presidential election . 
) [PER Bakiyev  ] was unaware of a major article in the [MISC Kyrgyz  ] press that very morning which stated that he , [PER Maxim Bakiyev  ] , is the power behind the throne in [LOC Kyrgyzstan  ] , and that he wields that power with the acquiescence and at the direction of the [ORG USG  ] ( via the [ORG CIA  ] ) . 
The [PER Trips  ] to the [LOC U.S.  ] , and the Elections ---------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The Ambassador and [PER Sarbaev  ] discussed the upcoming travel of the Prime Minister and [PER Sarbaev  ] himself to the [LOC U.S.  ] for [LOC UNGA  ] , consultations in [LOC Washington  ] , and then [PER Sarbaev  ] 's trip for discussions of the Annual Bilateral Consultations mechanism . 
[PER Sarbaev  ] noted that this is the first trip to the BISHKEK 00001065 002.3 OF 003 [LOC U.S.  ] for the PM and that it is very important that it go well . 
Ambassador pointed out that the [MISC Kyrgyz  ] delegation certainly must realize that [LOC U.S.  ] concerns about human rights and democratization will be raised in many of the PM 's meetings . 
He should be prepared to answer these questions in a positive and forthcoming manner . 
She also noted that slippage in the [ORG MCC  ] indicators was also likely to be raised during the visit. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Bakiyev  ] picked up on the Ambassador 's comments to state that the GOKG is very positive and proactive in its response to all these issues . 
It considers them to be very important . 
" When the [ORG OSCE  ] criticized the presidential elections , " he stated , " we asked them to be specific . 
What were the deficiencies ? 
Which were the districts where fraud had taken place ? 
We told them that we would annul the results from any polling stations where there had been fraud . 
We got no response from them . 
" Development , the [ORG EDF  ] , and Thinking Strategic -------------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Bakiyev  ] then broadened the subject by stating , in terms that echoed what the PM told the Ambassador this week ( [ORG REFTEL  ] ) , that they have brought together experts from many different fields to discuss what needs to be done in the country . 
Their desire to reform the institutions of [LOC Kyrgyzstan  ] was reflected in [PER Bakiyev  ] 's September 1 speech . 
However , he said , the country simply does not have the kind of economic expertise it needs in order to put together a real plan for development . 
That was what they hoped would come of the new $20 million [ORG Economic Development Fund  ] ( [ORG EDF  ] ) . 
They would like to have a high-powered economic consultancy come in , someone like [ORG Price Waterhouse  ] , who could put together a study of [LOC Kyrgyzstan  ] 's place in the world economy and what the country needs to do to spur integration and development. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Donor support , and especially [ORG USAID  ] , brought these sorts of consultants to [LOC Kyrgyzstan  ] in the early 1990s , [PER Bakiyev  ] said , but they were always focused narrowly on an already defined set of projects which were imported from abroad -- like privatization . 
There was never a study of [LOC Kyrgyzstan  ] 's potential and the barriers to development which took a look at what overall strategy the country should pursue and how to implement it . 
This was what they needed and wanted -- and the [MISC Kyrgyz  ] themselves should be the ones to put together the questions which should be put to the consultants , since they knew their country best. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Ambassador responded that the proposed structure of the fund , now on the Prime Minister 's desk in the form of a Memorandum of Understanding , would allow the GOKG to propose just such a study , if that was what they believed was needed . 
[PER Bakiyev  ] reiterated that the need was to gain an understanding of the place [LOC Kyrgyzstan  ] should occupy in the world economy and how to take advantage of its opportunities in order to develop . 
" We do not want this money for ourselves , " he said , " but we want to ensure that it is not used in traditional , unhelpful , assistance projects , but instead in something that is really well thought through . 
" <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Bakiyev  ] noted that one of [LOC Kyrgyzstan  ] 's natural advantages was its hydroelectric power potential . 
He expressed support for [ORG CASAREM  ] and bemoaned the delays in funding by the [ORG Asian Development Bank  ] . 
Ambassador asked about the status of the [ORG Kamburata  ] 2 hydro electric project . 
[PER Bakiyev  ] responded that the [MISC Russians  ] had not yet come through with the promised loan of $2 billion . 
He noted that the final cost of the project is not yet clear , given that construction would take about eight years and input prices are not stable . 
[PER Comment: Smart  ] , Corrupt , and a Good Ally to Have --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Maxim Bakiyev  ] is smart and well educated . 
He was able to discuss subjects ranging from early [MISC European  ] history to economics without any strain at all . 
He is apparently a voracious reader , and said he is currently reading [PER Greenspan  ] 's Age of Turbulence . 
According to many sources of widely varying credibility , he is also corrupt and benefiting economically from his father 's power . 
Statements he made during this lunch suggest that he could still be an ally on issues important to the [ORG USG  ] , ranging from his support for the BISHKEK 00001065 003.2 OF 003 [ORG Transit Center  ] 's continued operations to economic reform . 
It was interesting to note that , while the convener of this lunch was the Foreign QxMe , Qas2evQ talking points on the [ORG Economic Development Fund  ] were very similar to those the Prime Minister used with the Ambassador this week . 
Clearly [PER Bakiyev  ] has influence and access through a broad swath of the government . 
While this is a relationship which must be cultivated carefully , we believe it is also a relationship which can pay important dividends for the [ORG USG  ] .
