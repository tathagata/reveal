Separate summaries of the meetings follow . 
End Introduction. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) During a January 9 visit to [LOC Brasilia  ] , a [ORG CODEL  ] led by [ORG Senator  ] [PER Mitch McConnell  ] ( [LOC KY  ] ) , Majority Whip and Chairman of the State , Foreign Operations and [ORG Related Agencies Subcommittee  ] of the [ORG Appropriations Committee  ] , met with the Acting Minister of [ORG Development , Industry  ] and Trade [PER Mario Mugnaini  ] , Minister for [ORG Institutional Security General Felix  ] , and Foreign Minister [PER Celso Amorim  ] . 
In addition to [ORG Senator  ] [PER McConnell  ] , the [ORG CODEL  ] included: - [ORG Senator  ] [PER Mel Martinez  ] ( [LOC FL  ] ) ; - [ORG Senator  ] [PER Richard Burr  ] ( [LOC NC  ] ) ; and - [ORG Senator  ] [PER John Thune  ] ( [LOC SD  ] ) . 
MINISTRY OF DEVELOPMENT , INDUSTRY AND TRADE <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [PER McConnell  ] CODEL met with Acting Minister of [ORG Development , Industry  ] and [ORG Commerce  ] ( [ORG MDIC  ] ) [PER Mario Mugnaini  ] Jr. and Special Assistant [PER Aloisio Gomes Neto  ] to discuss how [LOC Brazil  ] and the [LOC US  ] might further their trade relationship . 
[PER Mugnaini  ] was mostly in talking mode , wanting to explain the current [MISC Brazil/US  ] trade relationship and where he would like to see it going . 
The GOB is currently unsatisfied with last year 's 12 percent increase in trade with the [LOC US  ] ( which is well below [LOC Brazil  ] 's average increase with trading partners in [LOC Latin America  ] ) . 
Both sides agreed that the [LOC US  ] is still [LOC Brazil  ] 's single most important trading partner . 
Looking to Increase Exports and Imports --------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While currently exports make up 16 percent of [MISC Brazilian  ] GDP and exports and imports combined make up 25 Percent , [ORG MDIC  ] would like for exports alone to make up 25 percent of the [MISC Brazilian  ] GDP . 
[PER Mugnaini  ] said [LOC Brazil  ] is looking for a 5 percent increase in imports to , and exports from , the [LOC US  ] . 
When pressed , [PER Mugnaini  ] said the sectors the Ministry sees the most room for growth are services ( with a caveat that more negotiations in the [ORG WTO  ] are needed ) , capital goods , electronics , mechanical equipment , and chemicals for medicine manufacture and fertilizer production . 
High quality fertilizer from the [LOC US  ] would help [LOC Brazil  ] increase agricultural production and therefore exports , he said . 
Agriculture , [MISC An Age Old Problem  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC US  ] agricultural aims are often in conflict and therefore complicate the import/export picture , according to [PER Mugnaini  ] . 
When Senator [PER Thune  ] pointed out that [LOC Brazil  ] 's agricultural exports to the [LOC US  ] outweigh [LOC US  ] agricultural exports to [LOC Brazil  ] by 10 to 1 , [PER Mugnaini  ] complained of a high effective tariff [LOC Brazil  ] pays to export sugar to the [LOC US  ] ( presumably referring to the over quota tariff rate ) . 
[PER Mugnaini  ] also mentioned [LOC US  ] cotton subsidies and a lack of satisfactory movement by the USG to comply with the [ORG WTO  ] panel ruling . 
[ORG Senator  ] [PER Thune  ] said the issue is in the process of being resolved . 
Senator [PER Martinez  ] suggested that joint marketing of orange juice to [LOC Asia  ] is one area that would benefit both [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC US  ] producers . 
[ORG US FTAs  ] Everywhere ; How about With [ORG Mercosul  ] ? -------------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Mugnaini  ] pointedly asked why the [LOC US  ] has recently completed so many free trade agreements with other countries in the hemisphere while no movement has been seen on the [ORG FTAA  ] or a bilateral agreement with [ORG Mercosul  ] . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is willing , he said , to move forward on bilateral agreements , but will not abandon the [ORG FTAA  ] . 
Senator [PER McConnell  ] said that in spite [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000117 002 OF 004 of its co-chairmanship of the [ORG FTAA  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] has not demonstrated the same level of commitment to a trade agreement that countries like [LOC Peru  ] , etc. have shown . 
Senator [PER Martinez  ] added that the recent inclusion of [LOC Venezuela  ] ( with its open animosity towards the [ORG FTAA  ] ) into [ORG Mercosul  ] further complicates the equation . 
[PER Mugnaini  ] admitted that negotiating a bilateral trade agreement would be difficult given [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Mercosul  ] obligations . 
He opined that [LOC Venezuela  ] will not be easily integrated into [ORG Mercosul  ] and he does not see full inclusion for well over a year. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The senators repeated their overall point: if [LOC Brazil  ] would like to continue [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations , set a date for talks , take a leadership role . 
The senators questioned the political will of the current [MISC Brazilian  ] administration to continue with free trade negotiations -- bilateral or multilateral -- given upcoming elections . 
[PER Mugnaini  ] expressed similar concerns in light of the upcoming end of Trade Promotion Authority and said that [LOC Brazil  ] 's leadership in [LOC Latin America  ] warrants a deepened relationship between our two countries , especially in the area of trade . 
He suggested that perhaps a deepening of private/public fora on free trade in both countries would be a way to continue the discussions . 
MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS 8 . 
( U ) In his meeting with the [ORG CODEL  ] , Foreign Minister [PER Amorim  ] was joined by Under Secretary for Political Affairs [PER Antonio de Aguiar Patriota  ] , as well as [LOC Paulo Alvarenga  ] from [ORG Itamaraty  ] 's [ORG US Desk  ] . 
[LOC Brazil  ] as Global Power ---------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Amorim  ] greeted the [ORG CODEL  ] with a comprehensive presentation on [MISC Brazilian  ] foreign policy , recapping [LOC Brazil  ] 's priorities and accomplishments under the [PER Lula  ] administration . 
[PER Amorim  ] described the current [MISC Brazilian  ] vision of a multi-polar world , taking exception to a statement that described [LOC Brazil  ] as a regional , rather than global , power . 
[PER Amorim  ] described [MISC US-Brazil  ] relations as good to great , noting his friendship with Secretary of State Rice and between Presidents [PER Bush  ] and [PER Lula  ] . 
[LOC Haiti  ] - [LOC Brazil  ] in for the [MISC Long-Haul  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG CODEL  ] opened a discussion on [LOC Haiti  ] by extending condolences for the January 7 death of General [PER Urano Teixeira da Matta Bacellar  ] , the [MISC Brazilian  ] general who had led the [MISC MINUSTAH  ] peacekeeping mission in [LOC Haiti  ] since August 2005 . 
[PER Amorim  ] avoided discussing the specifics surrounding General [PER Bacellar  ] 's death , but reiterated public statements he had made indicating that [LOC Brazil  ] is committed to continuing the mission in [LOC Haiti  ] . 
While noting that preserving law and order is essential , [PER Amorim  ] voiced concern that without jobs , improved infrastructure , and industrial development , it will be difficult to make fundamental changes in [LOC Haiti  ] 's situation . 
[LOC Bolivia  ] - Urging Moderation --------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In response to a question by Senator [PER Martinez  ] , [PER Amorim  ] shared his view that [MISC Bolivian  ] president-elect [PER Evo Morales  ] had rightly chosen to work through the democratic process . 
[PER Amorim  ] recounted that he and President [PER Lula  ] had met with [PER Morales  ] on a number of occasions since 2002 , always encouraging him to work for change following a democratic course . 
[PER Amorim  ] expressed surprise that [PER Morales  ] had been successful so quickly on the electoral front . 
Despite his general support for [PER Morales  ] , [PER Amorim  ] acknowledged that unchecked nationalism on the part of [PER Morales  ] could be problematic ; noting substantial [MISC Brazilian  ] investments in [LOC Bolivia  ] and the countries' 3200 kilometer shared border . 
[PER Amorim  ] emphasized the need for [PER Morales  ] to govern in a moderate manner that encourages investment and trade . 
[LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000117 003 OF 004 Another Pitch for [MISC Mercosul-US  ] Negotiations -------------------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In the upteenth time within the last couple years , [PER Amorim  ] made a pitch that the [LOC US  ] negotiate a bilateral free trade agreement with the [ORG Mercosul  ] trade bloc . 
[PER Amorim  ] drew a distinction between [ORG Mercosul  ] and other [LOC US  ] FTA partners , claiming the levels of industrial development in [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Argentina  ] denote interests which require negotiation of a different type of agreement than that which the [LOC US  ] has pursued with other countries , such as [LOC El Salvador  ] . 
He stated that the [LOC US  ] position on agricultural subsidies in the [ORG WTO  ] [LOC Doha  ] negotiations was helpful , both in terms of the [LOC Doha  ] round and for possible bilateral negotiations . 
Providing some insight into [ORG Mercosul  ] dynamics , [PER Amorim  ] at one point said that on many issues , he doesn't even need to consult his [ORG Mercosul  ] colleagues , because " he knows what they think . 
" <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Visibly uncomfortable when Senator [PER Martinez  ] wondered how such a bilateral deal would be possible with [LOC Venezuela  ] in [LOC Mercosul  ] , Minister [PER Amorim  ] responded that many questions " remain unanswered " regarding [LOC Venezuela  ] 's [ORG Mercosul  ] membership , adding that " at this stage , [LOC Venezuela  ] in [LOC Mercosul  ] is more of a political desire than a reality . 
" THE PLANALTO <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Presidency 's Minister for [ORG Institutional Security  ] , General [PER Jorge Armando Felix  ] , opened his meeting with the [ORG CODEL  ] with a briefing on the functions of his office , the [ORG Institutional Security Cabinet  ] ( [ORG GSI  ] ) of the Presidency . 
He explained the [ORG GSI  ] 's roles in overseeing [LOC Brazil  ] 's intelligence service ( [ORG ABIN  ] ) , interfacing with the armed forces , coordinating the national drug prevention program and planning for and facilitating interagency management of a range of crises , from natural disasters to major land invasions . 
[PER Felix  ] was accompanied by senior [ORG GSI  ] officials with responsibilities in these areas . 
The [LOC Tri-Border Area  ] ------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Senator [PER Burr  ] asked [PER Felix  ] for his views on [MISC US-Brazil  ] cooperation in intelligence and security , and whether changes in the [LOC US  ] intelligence community ( [ORG IC  ] ) had impacted [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[PER Felix  ] responded that bilateral cooperation is very good , with long-standing and successful operational cooperation between [MISC Brazilian  ] security services and [LOC US  ] counterparts , including in monitoring activities in the [LOC Tri-Border Area  ] ( [ORG TBA  ] ) . 
He indicated changes in the [ORG US IC  ] had not negatively affected cooperation , praised his reception during a recent working visit to [LOC US  ] agencies , and said it was imperative that nations work closely together in facing threats that cross borders . 
Elaborating on the [ORG TBA  ] question , [PER Felix  ] noted that the region is a fulcrum for a range of illegal activities , including smuggling , narcotrafficking , product piracy and money laundering , but that there is " no evidence " currently of operational activities by terrorist cells . 
But [LOC Brazil  ] , he continued , is " attentive " to any potential terrorist threats , and has also mounted a major interagency enforcement effort in the [ORG TBA  ] over the past year aimed at interdicting smuggling and other illegal cross-border activities. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Senator [PER McConnell  ] pressed [PER Felix  ] on his assertion that there is no indication of terrorist activities in the [ORG TBA  ] . 
[PER Felix  ] stressed the use of the term " evidence " and hastened to add that the [ORG GOB  ] understands and concerned that cells are present in the area , and is actively monitoring them . 
He went onto explain changes in the last two-plus decades in [MISC Middle Eastern  ] immigration into [LOC Brazil  ] , noting the traditional majority of [MISC Christians  ] from [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Lebanon  ] settled in greater [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , followed in recent years by an increase in [MISC Muslims  ] from [LOC Lebanon  ] moving especially into the [ORG TBA  ] . 
But the [ORG GOB  ] is resistant to characterizations that could " stigmatize " entire ethnic groups , and hence is careful in its assessments and statements regarding terrorism , he added . 
[LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000117 004 OF 004 [LOC Bolivia  ] ------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In response to questions from Senator Thune and [PER Martinez  ] , [PER Felix  ] noted that other threats from the [ORG TBA  ] and other frontier areas with [LOC Bolivia  ] include arms trafficking ( he noted the preponderance of weapons are of [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG Eastern European  ] origin ) and , especially , narcotrafficking . 
With regard to the recent electoral victory in [LOC Bolivia  ] of [PER Evo Morales  ] , [PER Felix  ] noted that [PER Morales  ] is making a rhetorical distinction between growth of coca leaf for traditional applications , which [PER Morales  ] supports , and narcotrafficking , which [PER Morales  ] says he will combat . 
The [ORG GOB  ] is watching this closely and has outlined its concern to [PER Morales  ] , including in a recent meeting between [PER Morales  ] and [PER Lula  ] . 
The length of [LOC Brazil  ] 's border with [LOC Bolivia  ] and the influx of cocaine products into [LOC Brazil  ] make this a crucial issue , [PER Felix  ] said , but [LOC Brazil  ] is approaching the question calmly . 
There is focus within the [ORG GOB  ] on finding ideas and channels for investment and development in [LOC Bolivia  ] that can ameliorate the extreme poverty that makes cocaine trafficking so attractive to many growers , [PER Felix  ] added. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 .
