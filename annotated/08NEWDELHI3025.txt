It may be too little too late , however , for the [ORG Congress Party  ] to reverse its fortunes before May 2009 . 
End Summary . 
Fury at the [ORG UPA  ] --------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In the 36 hours since the terrorists in [LOC Mumbai  ] were taken out , the firing stopped and the clean-up began , it has become increasingly clear that the [MISC Indian  ] public is furious at the [ORG United Progressive Alliance  ] ( [ORG UPA  ] ) government , especially the [ORG Congress Party  ] . 
The [MISC Indian  ] public and the media point the finger squarely at the Prime Minister and [PER Sonia Gandhi  ] for breakdown of the intelligence apparatus and for failure to build the capacity to fight terrorism. “Enough is enough” is the prevailing sentiment . 
In the immediate aftermath of the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks , the public is beginning to look upon its government with both anger and ridicule . 
In this atmosphere , voters are likely to inflict a severe setback to the [ORG Congress Party  ] in state elections which are underway now , and national elections , due before May 2009 . 
State legislative elections results for five states are due to be announced on December 8 , with polling in three of five states taking place after the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks began . 
Political Fallout ----------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The political fallout started immediately after the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks ended , amid signs that [ORG GOI  ] leadership understands the gravity of the political backlash . 
On November 29 , [PER Sonia Gandhi  ] called together the party top brass to take stock of the political damage when she convened an emergency meeting of the party [ORG Congress Working Committee  ] , the party’s highest decision-making body . 
Home Minister [PER Shivraj Patil  ] was subjected to heavy criticism by his colleagues at that meeting . 
The Prime Minister called a meeting of his defense and intelligence team on November 29 to discuss options to react to the mounting evidence that the terrorists belonged to [MISC Pakistan-based  ] Jihadi groups . 
The Prime Minister also convened an all-party meeting on November 30 to discuss a united approach to strengthening the country’s terror-fighting capacity . 
The [ORG UPA  ] will brace for a hammering from opposition parties and its erstwhile [MISC Communist  ] partners when parliament convenes on December 10 . 
Heads Begin to Roll ------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Following bitter criticism of his performance by the media , the opposition [ORG Bharatiya Janata Party  ] ( [ORG BJP  ] ) and his own [ORG Congress Party  ] colleagues , [PER Patil  ] submitted his resignation to the Prime Minister on November 30 and it has NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00003025 002 OF 003 been accepted . 
Finance Minister [PER P.C. Chidamabram  ] will move over to the [ORG Home Ministry  ] while the Prime Minister will take over the [ORG Finance Ministry  ] . 
[PER Chidambaram  ] has previously served as a Minister of State in the Home Ministry. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) There was media speculation on November 30 that [ORG National Security Adviser  ] [PER M.K. Narayanan  ] had offered to resign . 
Post contacts tell us , however , that [PER Narayanan  ] will remain in place . 
There is continuing and widespread media speculation as to how far the blood letting will go . 
Names of Home Secretary [PER Madhukar Gupta  ] , [ORG Intelligence Bureau Chief  ] [PER P.C. Haldar  ] , [ORG Maharashtra Chief  ] Minister [PER Vilasrao Deshmukh  ] and [ORG Maharashtra Home Minister  ] R.R. [PER Patil  ] are often mentioned as being on the chopping block . 
But no action has been taken on these men as of the evening of November 30 . 
Other Measures -------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Another action that the [ORG UPA  ] is almost sure to take is strengthening laws to fight terrorism . 
The [ORG UPA  ] had repealed the tough [ORG Prevention of Terrorism Act  ] when it came to power on grounds that it was abused by the security agencies . 
There is a clamor now in the political classes to toughen the laws . 
The Prime Minister , in his address to the nation promised tightening of the laws to “ensure that there are no loopholes available to the terrorists . 
Some obsevers have called for an [MISC Indian  ] “Patriot Act.” Other steps it will likely consider are creation of a central security agency to focus combating terrorism and to streamline federal-state terror fighting coordination . 
[LOC Pakistan: No  ] Immediate Calls for Retaliation -------------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) While the media has reported on the [LOC Pakistan  ] ties of the captured terrorist , there were no angry calls for swift retribution against the [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
However the public feels about [MISC Pakistani  ] involvement , it will not let the [ORG GOI  ] off hook for its failure to prevent the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks if it tries to shift the attention and blame to [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
The [ORG GOI  ] appears to sense this and so far is publicly floating a non-kinetic response: suspension of the [ORG Composite Dialogue  ] , recalling the Ambassador to [LOC Islamabad  ] , and cancelling cricket matches , even at neutral venues . 
Comment ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Embassy’s preliminary assessment is that the [ORG Congress Party  ] understands that it is in deep political trouble over its handling of the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks and is desperately seeking to limit the damage . 
The firing of the Home Minister and other personnel changes in the government , if they occur , as well as announcing steps to improve the country’s terror fighting capability are all intended to convey a political message to the [MISC Indian  ] public that the [ORG UPA  ] government takes the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks seriously . 
It may be too little too late , however , for the [ORG Congress Party  ] to reverse its fortunes before May 2009. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) In this environment , removal of the Home Minister was inevitable . 
He has over the last four years proved himself to be spectacularly inept . 
In almost every incident of terrorist or communal violence - [LOC Bangalore  ] , [LOC Ahemdabad  ] , [LOC Jaipur  ] , [LOC Delhi  ] , [LOC Uttar Pradesh  ] , [LOC Guwahati  ] , [ORG Samjhauta Express  ] , [ORG Orissa  ] , [LOC Karnataka  ] , [LOC Jammu  ] and [LOC Kashmir  ] - he has been asleep on the watch . 
Each time there have been calls for his ouster but [PER Sonia Gandhi  ] has protected him . 
The public’s reaction to the [LOC Mumbai  ] incidents has been such that even she could not save him this time. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) We believe there is a fair chance that there will be NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00003025 003 OF 003 a political shakeout in the state of [LOC Maharashtra  ] as well . 
There has been an active faction in the state’s [ORG Congress Party  ] that has long been plotting to oust Chief Minister [PER Deshmukh  ] . 
These calls have grown louder over the last few days . 
The [ORG Maharashtra Home Minister  ] R.R. [PER Patil  ] became the object of scathing media ridicule when he played down the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks by saying on television that these sorts of incidents happen from time to time in a big city such as [LOC Mumbai.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) It is not clear how deep the scalping will run within the bureaucracy . 
The Prime Minister will have to balance the pressure for heads to roll with the fact that getting rid of [PER NSA Narayanan  ] , Home Secretary [PER Gupta  ] and [ORG Intelligence Bureau  ] chief [PER Haldar  ] will mean he will be left with a completely new intelligence team that will take time to settle in , not an attractive prospect to govern with in the last few months of his term . 
The discipline and culture of [MISC Indian  ] bureaucracy is such that if these men stay on they will continue to wield power and would not be treated as damaged goods by the rest of the government .
