( C ) President [PER Venetiaan  ] has agreed to a short ( 15 minute ) courtesy call late in the afternoon of Saturday , October 6 , immediately following your visit to the [LOC USNS Comfort  ] . 
Venue for the meeting will be either the [LOC Presidential Palace  ] or the President 's [ORG Cabinet Office  ] , both in [LOC Paramaribo  ] . 
At that same venue , and immediately following your courtesy call , we propose ( and are attempting to confirm with the [ORG Office  ] of the President ) that [PER Venetiaan  ] participate with you in a brief ( 15 minute ) ceremony to officially close the [ORG Comfort  ] mission. --------------------------------------------- -------- President of the [LOC Republic  ] of [LOC Suriname  ] , H.E. President Runaldo [PER Ronald Venetiaan  ] ( phonetic: FENEchiyan ) : a Biography --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Three-term President [PER Venetiaan  ] ( 1991-1996 ; 2000-present ) has a relatively long history in [MISC Surinamese  ] politics . 
Originally a mathematics professor , he became chairman of the [ORG National Party of Suriname  ] ( [ORG NPS  ] ) in 1993 , and was elected a member of the [ORG National Assembly  ] in 1996 . 
He is married and the father of four grown children . 
Relations between the 71-year-old [PER Venetiaan  ] and Post are cordial , but not warm . 
Nor is the distant [PER Venetiaan  ] an especially popular leader with the [MISC Surinamese  ] population. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Venetiaan  ] is , however , a canny politician whose strategy of non-confrontation has enabled him to hold together a multi-party governing coalition that is riven with infighting yet clings to a 4-seat majority in the 51-seat parliament . 
In [LOC Suriname  ] 's [MISC Dutch-model  ] consociational politics , parties laboriously reach consensus with the goal of dividing up available resources , ministries , ambassadorships , and other spoils of power , and delivering them to their ( often ethnically-based ) constituencies. --------------------------------------------- ----- Background Information and Issues: Gates/Venetiaan Courtesy Call --------------------------------------------- ----- ( [ORG SBU  ] ) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
Issue 1: Despite biases to the contrary , [LOC Suriname  ] should consider the [LOC United States  ] a strong partner . 
Background Information: President [PER Venetiaan  ] 's north-south bias with respect to the [LOC United States  ] is evident in his public statements . 
In August 2007 , media reported [PER Venetiaan  ] 's comments that in the post-Cold War period the [ORG United Nations  ] has had a difficult time realizing its goals because the [LOC United States  ] has a monopoly on power and determines the fate of the rest of the world . 
In June 2007 , [PER Venetiaan  ] was the only [MISC CARICOM Head of State  ] or Government to decline an invitation to meet President [PER Bush  ] during the [ORG Conference  ] on the [LOC Caribbean  ] in [LOC Washington  ] . 
The reason: [ORG Conference  ] timing conflicted with his birthday . 
The President is enthusiastic about regional integration and [LOC Suriname  ] has shown a tendency to downplay relations with the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Europe  ] in favor of ties with [LOC CARICOM  ] , [LOC Cuba  ] , and [LOC Venezuela  ] ( and also outside of the region with [LOC China  ] , [LOC India  ] , and [LOC Indonesia  ] ) . 
He met with [PER Hugo Chavez  ] on his return trip from the 2006 [ORG UN General Assembly  ] and called him our brother when I presented my credentials to him in September <a id='par2006' href='#par2006'>¶</a>2006 . 
Despite [PER Venetiaan  ] 's biases , he should recognize that the [LOC United States  ] is committed to [LOC Suriname  ] , and to the region . 
The [LOC USNS Comfort  ] , ongoing [ORG IMET  ] and past [ORG FMF  ] support , [ORG MEDRETES  ] , and [ORG New Horizons  ] provide tangible evidence of our value as a partner. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Issue 2: The [LOC United States  ] has demonstrated its commitment to work with [LOC Suriname  ] as it further professionalizes its armed forces , and strengthens civil-military relations , democracy , and the rule of law . 
[ORG PARAMARIBO  ] 00000510 002 OF 002 Background Information: Through the [LOC United States  ] Southern Command ( [ORG SouthCom  ] ) , [LOC Suriname  ] 's [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] ( [ORG MOD  ] ) and its armed forces have developed a strong , multifaceted partnership that , through example , has helped [LOC Suriname  ] on the road to stronger civil-military relations and a more professional military . 
This in turn is critical to the furtherance of democracy and the rule of law in [LOC Suriname  ] where , since military rule ended in 1992 , there has been a strained relationship between the civilian government and the armed forces . 
[PER Venetiaan  ] likely harbors some residual antipathy towards the military due to his imprisonment and alleged mistreatment under the regime of former military strongman ( and current member of parliament ) [PER Desi Bouterse.  ] -------------- Talking Points -------------- -- Appreciate your flexibility in agreeing to meet on a Saturday afternoon . 
-- Pleased to have this opportunity to visit your country while the [LOC USNS Comfort  ] is here to provide medical services to the people of [LOC Suriname  ] . 
-- Thank you for the support that your government , and in particular your Ministries of [ORG Defense  ] and Health , have given to the [ORG Comfort  ] mission . 
-- Understand that Surinamers and [MISC Americans  ] have worked closely throughout this entire process so that the [ORG Comfort  ] 's visit would be a true benefit for the people of [LOC Suriname  ] . 
-- [PER Hope  ] that you see the [ORG Comfort  ] as the latest in a long list of [LOC United States  ] programs which demonstrate support and friendship from the people and government of the [LOC United States  ] to the people and government of [LOC Suriname  ] . 
-- Certainly that was the intent of President [PER Bush  ] when he sent the [ORG Comfort  ] and its doctors and nurses to this region . 
-- As you are doubtless aware , our [LOC United States  ] Southern Command has a strong , multifaceted relationship with your [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] and armed forces which includes humanitarian as well as military aid . 
-- We are strongly committed to working with our partners in the region to further professionalize their armed forces while also strengthening civil-military relations . 
-- Speaking of regional issues , I would be interested in your views , as President , on the recent decision by the [ORG ILOS  ] regarding the maritime border . 
-- Thank you again for taking the time to receive me .
