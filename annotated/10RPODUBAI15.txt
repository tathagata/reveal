( C ) SUMMARY: At this point the [ORG Green Path Opposition  ] ( [ORG GPO  ] ) is more of a persistent problem for the regime than an existential threat , and it is unrealistic to assume that the [ORG GPO  ] will be able to effect any 'regime change' in the short-term . 
[LOC Iran  ] 's ruling regime is likely to continue seeing increased violence and suppression as its most effective tool , including in the build-up to mid- February anniversary of the Revolution and the opposition 's next planned protests . 
However it is unlikely be able to eliminate the [ORG GPO  ] , which will continue trying to co-opt public holidays to stage anti-regime protests and also try to increase divisions among regime elite . 
Although subsets of the [ORG GPO  ] are radicalizing , there is no reason to assume that [ORG GPO  ] elements seeking to fundamentally change the system represent most [MISC Iranians  ] . 
The [ORG GPO  ] does not mirror the widespread an varied opposition that overturned the [PER Shah  ] thirty years ago , and the standoff now is increasingly becoming a stalemate that ( inter alia ) imperils the [LOC IRIG  ] 's ability to engage with the [LOC West  ] . 
Until a new homeostasis is reached in [LOC Iran  ] 's political ruling class , progress on issues of bilateral importance will be even more difficult than usual . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) NOTE: This is the second in a series of cables examining the [MISC Iranian  ] opposition since the June 12 Presidential election , what might happen in the short-term , and what the most effective levers of [LOC US  ] policy have been so far and what combination may have the most impact in the coming months . 
ON THIS SIDE: REGIME ----------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [LOC Iran  ] 's current leadership sees the [ORG GPO  ] with its periodic street demonstrations more as a persistent problem than as an existential threat . 
Ideology and personal experience have taught regime hard-liners to equate compromise under pressure with weakness . 
Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] ( [ORG SLK  ] ) himself is said to believe that the [PER Shah  ] 's fatal mistake , and the reason the Revolution succeeded , was because the [PER Shah  ] 'retreated , ' in addition to believing that the [LOC USSR  ] 's fall was due to the same reasons . 
As such , the regime can be expected to remain committed to using force and repression against the [ORG GPO  ] as necessary to both incapacitate its first- and second-tier leadership ( primarily through detention ) and its rank and file ( through detention and violence , to include deadly force ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Opposition activists have told IRPO that at least part of the regime strategy is a pre-emptive 'rolling round-up' of not just active [ORG GPO  ] elements but also sympathizers . 
Thus in addition to those it identifies as participating in [ORG GPO  ] activities , the regime goes after reformist reporters , feminists , human rights advocates , labor organizers , ageing 'National Front' sympathizers , 'Second of [PER Khordad' Khatami-era  ] reformists who are not active in the [ORG GPO  ] movement . 
According to some foreign-based [ORG GPO  ] leaders , informed estimates indicate approximately 2,000 people have been thus far detained. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Indications are that the regime is laying the groundwork for using even more violence , to include the broader use of lethal force at the popular level if necessary . 
This could include executions of those found guilty of 'warring against [PER God  ] , ' a term which the regime is prone to define somewhat expansively . 
And while there is certainly a limit to the regime 's willingness to use violence against its own people , there are no indications that it is anywhere near it . 
One former [ORG IRGC  ] officer told an Iranwatcher that the [ORG IRGC  ] wants to avoid killing more than a 'few dozen' protestors in any one location on any one day , partially to avoid associations with 'Black Friday' -September 8 , 1978 - when mass fatalities in a demonstration turned many against the [PER Shah  ] ) . 
The [MISC Ashura-day  ] murder of [PER Mousavi  ] 's nephew , in addition to the January 7 incident where security officials seemed to have coordinated shots being fired at a car carrying [MISC Karrubi  ] indicate a regime intent to [ORG DUBAI  ] 00000015 002 OF 006 calibrate its level of violence to intimidate the opposition and its leadership. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The media press environment is also expected to become far more restrictive , with one prominent reformist newsman telling IRPO that he expects all reformist papers to be shut down in the short-term . 
The regime continues to block 's ubversive' websites , while also stepping up it jamming of satellite broadcasts from both [ORG VOA  ] and [ORG BBC.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) In addition to its familiar tools of force and repression , the regime also occasionally feints toward reconciliation , issuing statements counseling moderation and offering up an occasional scapegoat , such as the recent [ORG Majlis  ] report blaming former [ORG Tehran Prosecutor General Mortazavi  ] for the detainee deaths at the [LOC Kahrizak  ] detention center . 
In the public thrust and parry over post-June 12 events one regime voice conspicuous by its absence has been that of President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , who has largely kept silent . 
This strategy has drawn criticism by some fellow hard-liners , who fault him for his unwillingness to publicly endorse harsh measures against the [ORG GPO.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) According to [ORG GPO  ] expatriate leaders and other sources , the ruling regime can be seen as composed of three groups , with [PER Khamenei  ] still exercising control: - relative moderates , such as [PER Ali Larijani  ] and [PER Ahmad Tavakolli  ] in the [ORG Majlis  ] , and [PER Asghar Hejazi  ] , former Foreign Minister [PER Velayati  ] and former [ORG Majlis  ] Speaker [ORG Nateq-Nuri  ] all in the Supreme Leader 's office . 
This group seeks to have [ORG SLK  ] cease his active support of [PER Ahmadinejad  ] so that he can be removed by the [ORG Majlis  ] ; -hardliners , such as [ORG IRGC Intelligence Head Hossein Taeb  ] , [ORG Khameneni  ] 's son [PER Mojtaba  ] , Basij Commander BG [PER Mohammad Reza Naqdi  ] , [PER Ayatollah Mesbah Yazdi  ] , and [PER Ahmadinejad  ] and his own crowd . 
This group seeks increased use of force , to include lethal force , on the [ORG GPO  ] and its leaders ; - a middle way 's wing' group , composed of [ORG SLK  ] himself , his two sons [ORG Mostafa  ] and [ORG Maysam  ] , and some intelligence officials . 
This group seeks a middle course between the two above , favoring imprisoning , beating but not mass killing of protestors , and house arrest and intimidation but not arrest and/or execution of [ORG GPO  ] leaders . 
ON THIS SIDE: [ORG GPO  ] ------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Going forward , the [ORG GPO  ] seems committed to using public holidays as a show of strength and support , with the next big [ORG GPO  ] planned demonstration being the anniversary of the Revolution 's victory on February 11 ( 22 [MISC Bahman  ] ) . 
According to at least one prominent [ORG GPO  ] activist based abroad , the [ORG GPO  ] leadership has a three-part strategy: - ( 1 ) Maintaining [ORG GPO  ] unity while also 'growing' and training its numbers , expanding both geographically and in its constituent class/demographic/ethnic elements . 
Public street gatherings on key dates are one way of showing solidarity , as are slogans from rooftops , work slowdowns , and other non-violent 'political actions.' 
It will also seek to expand its use of 'blitz' demonstrations , i.e. rapid assembly and dispersal of protestors , in [LOC DUBAI  ] 00000015 003 OF 006 addition to university demonstrations and other forms of protest . 
In this regard it seeks to strengthen links with [LOC Iran  ] 's labor force , many of whom have a tradition of striking over non-payment of wages . 
( NOTE: The [ORG GPO  ] 's diffuse structure , and constant regime pressure , will make implementing better organization and training difficult in the short-term ) . - ( 2 ) Creating divisions within the ruling elite , by 'peeling off' the moderates around [PER Khamenei  ] . 
[PER Mousavi  ] 's recent statement in which he tacitly accepted the legitimacy of the [PER Ahmadinejad  ] government was a step in this direction . 
Second of [MISC Khordad  ] 'theoretician' Said [MISC Hajjarian  ] used to speak of the tactic of 'pressure from below , negotiations from above' as the reformist strategy , and at least some [ORG GPO  ] strategists hope that elite pressure from moderate conservatives dismayed at ongoing popular protests will seek to convince [ORG SLK  ] to cease his active support of [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , at which point he will be subject to possibly politically fatal attacks from the [ORG Majlis  ] due to ( inter alia ) his financial mismanagement . 
These [ORG GPO  ] strategists , who curiously also see regime compromise as a sign of weakness , see Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] 's 'throwing [PER Ahmadinejad  ] under the bus' as the first step to ultimately bringing down Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] himself - ( 3 ) Continuing non-violent efforts to 'paralyze' the government , largely through boycotts of [ORG IRGC  ] affiliated companies , through work slowdowns , and ultimately through strikes . 
Some within the [ORG GPO  ] see the December 27 Ashura demonstrations as equivalent to the 17 Shahrivar demonstrations during the Revolution , after which the people slowly 'lost their fear' of the [PER Shah  ] 's machinery of repression . 
However , even the most optimistic [ORG GPO  ] leaders acknowledge the movement needs significantly more organization and training before it is able to engage in larger anti-regime activities ( NOTE: Another advantage of a non-violent strategy is that such non-violent protests are technically authorized by [ORG Article  ] 27 of the Constitution . 
As such , any move to anti-regime violence would represent not just an escalation in the likely overall level of violence , but a move from inter-Constitutional to extra-Constitutional opposition ) . <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) This 3-part strategy , as articulated by a [ORG GPO  ] leader based abroad , in many respects depends on the willingness of the mass movement of the [ORG GPO  ] for support ; whether it has been embraced by the popular elements of the [ORG GPO  ] opposition is unclear . 
Furthermore , the increasing radicalization of popular elements within the [ORG GPO  ] potentially undermines this strategy and at the very least makes near-term predictions less reliable . 
An opposition that increasingly responds to regime violence with its own violence gives the regime greater license to increase repression even further , creating an unpredictable cycle of violence coupled with greater disillusionment with the regime. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) MEDIA AND CYBERSPACE: The regime and [ORG GPO  ] clash not just in the streets but also in cyberspace , and the [ORG GPO  ] can be expected to expand its efforts to create a virtual space in which it can disseminate information to [MISC Iranians  ] inside [LOC Iran  ] . 
It continues to spend significant energies on circumventing [MISC Iranian  ] attempts to monitor , control and block [MISC Internet  ] access in [LOC Iran  ] , and is exploring the possibility of providing satellite high-speed internet access , although funding is the main barrier . 
In conventional media , expatriate [ORG GPO  ] activists have told [ORG IRPO  ] that while in the short-term [ORG GPO  ] is forced to rely on satellite TV such as [ORG VOA  ] and [ORG BBC  ] to get oppositionist news into [LOC Iran  ] , it is seeking to create its own news fora , to include its own satellite television broadcast . 
NO 2ND REVOLUTION ----------------------------- [LOC DUBAI  ] 00000015 004 OF 006 <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) No one knows or can know what will happen next . 
While [LOC Iran  ] is not [LOC North Korea  ] , since June 12 and the subsequent crackdown it has become harder to follow significant events there , both at the popular and elite level . 
Foreign media presence has been severely curtailed and domestic media is increasingly censored . 
And [LOC Iran  ] 's hardline intelligence-security cabal 's 's oft overthrow' fixation has reduced the number and type of [MISC Iranians  ] willing to talk frankly to the press ( and to Iranwatchers ) about domestic events. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Against that backdrop one must note the 's elective perception' bias that tends to over-emphasize the [ORG GPO  ] 's potency . 
Some pro-GPO bias stems from their being the ( relative ) 'good guys' in this drama , to the extent that their agenda encompasses principles dear to [MISC Western  ] democracies . 
Additionally , [MISC Western  ] media 's [LOC Iran  ] contacts tend to be pro-reformist , with [MISC Western  ] press quoting pro-GPO activists and analysts almost exclusively . 
Also USG officials' interactions with [MISC Iranians  ] tend to be largely limited to [MISC Iranians  ] willing and able to talk with us , with a disproportionate number of them being those seeking USG assistance in helping fight the regime . 
Finally and in many ways most importantly 'if it bleeds it leads , ' so there are no 'Youtube' uploads on demonstration days of the millions of ordinary [MISC Iranians  ] who are going about their business. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) In this regard , many [ORG IRPO  ] interlocutors comment that for most in [LOC Tehran  ] , life is going on as normal , with no sensation of living in 'a police state' ( except on the key dates targeted by the [ORG GPO  ] , and only then for people in specific areas where clashes occur ) . 
In other words , it seems that the vast majority of [MISC Iranians  ] , though more critical of the government to greater or lesser degrees , are continuing to live their lives as normal . 
There is no reason to assume that those 'radical' [ORG GPO  ] elements seeking to fundamentally change the system represent most [MISC Iranians  ] . 
At most , it appears that many and possibly most [MISC Iranians  ] want a peaceful reform of the system as opposed to another revolution with an uncertain outcome. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Having stipulated that no one can assert with confidence what will happen in [LOC Iran  ] 's domestic situation over the next year , it does seem that , as expatriate [MISC Iranian  ] oppositionist [PER Ibrahim Nabavi  ] has written , [LOC Iran  ] is moving 'from crisis to stalemate.' 
The clash between [LOC Iran  ] 's government hardliners and the [ORG GPO  ] is unlikely to end decisively to the benefit of either side within the short-term , and it is quite improbable that in the short-term the [ORG GPO  ] will in some decisive way 'd efeat' the [PER Khamenei  ] regime and change [LOC Iran  ] 's theocracy into a secular republic. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) In terms of the significant metrics by which can judge the course of future events , some of the ones significant both in 1977-79 and now include the following: - Numbers: The numbers of protestors willing to take to the streets now is an order of magnitude smaller than in 78-79. - Classes: the [ORG GPO  ] as currently constituted doesn't seem to have a significant ethnic or labor component , and doesn't seem to have 'broken out' of [LOC Tehran  ] in a significant way to other major urban centers , though we recognize that our awareness of developments outside of [LOC Tehran  ] is likely to be more limited. - Anti-Gov't Activities: Unlike 1979 , there have been no paralyzing strikes , bazaar closings , military defections , or signs of the government ceasing to function . 
Whereas the bazaar merchants in 1979 had the inclination and money to fund striking workers deprived of pay , the there seems to be no such [ORG GPO  ] 'd eep pockets.' 
Indeed both elements of the 'bazaar-mosque' alliance that were in [LOC DUBAI  ] 00000015 005 OF 006 many ways the backbone of the 1979 Revolution are singularly absent in today 's opposition , as each has been largely co-opted by the government . 
There have been no indications that [PER Rafsanjani  ] and the [ORG Servants of Construction  ] or [PER Qalibaf  ] 's [LOC Tehran  ] Municipality are currently a significant [ORG GPO  ] funding source . 
On a far more limited scale , expatriate 'Second of [ORG Khordad' Reformist  ] elements within the [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Diaspora  ] are leading efforts to create a fund for the support of detainee families. - Elite Defection/Emigration: Those hardliners who constitute and support the regime are very likely to remain committed to the fight against the [ORG GPO  ] , since they know they would have no role in any new order and would also have nowhere else to go . 
However for the [ORG GPO  ] , many reformists and oppositionists dissatisfied with [LOC Iran  ] 's plight would rather quit then fight , as shown by the ongoing brain drain , to include increased exodus of political activists . 
Anecdotal information shows that many of larger numbers of affluent and educated [MISC Iranians  ] who can be presumed to be oppose the hardliners are taking their families and fortunes abroad. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) Although much [ORG GPO  ] animus has transferred from [PER Ahmadinejad  ] to [ORG SLK  ] , it can be assumed that at least part of the movement 's support would fade were [PER Ahmadinejad  ] to be replaced by someone less controversial and better equipped to successfully govern . 
Although [ORG SLK  ] has shown that he prefers suppression to compromise , at some point pressure at the elite level might persuade him to abandon or marginalize [PER Ahmadinejad  ] . 
Granted , the subsequent [MISC Presidential  ] election could provide another spark for future protests , but the point here is that at both at the popular and elite level , at least some oppositionist fervor is still fixated on [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , and would presumably dissipate with his dismissal . 
STALEMATE TO CONTINUE ---------------------------------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) The [ORG IRIG  ] 's decision-making process , multi-polar and messy even before this turmoil , has been further strained by the battle between the regime and the [ORG GPO  ] as well as by the animosity toward [PER Ahmadinejad  ] from within the regime . 
For example , domestic political opposition torpedoed [PER Khamenei  ] and [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's ability to sell the [ORG IAEA  ] 's [ORG Tehran Research Reactor  ] agreement . 
Subsidy reform , the most important piece of domestic legislation in years , was passed only after a protracted political cage fight between [PER Ahmadinejad  ] and the [ORG Majlis  ] . 
Amid the [MISC IRIG-GPO  ] stalemate and the accompanying factionalization in the conservative 'Principalist' camp , [LOC Iran  ] will be hard pressed achieve consensus and move forward on issues relevant to the [MISC USG.  ] <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) As one [MISC US-based  ] [ORG IRPO  ] contact noted , only one thing is certain , namely uncertainty over how the contest will play out . 
It is clear neither regime leaders nor opposition figures are convinced of the path ahead and they are constantly recalibrating and shifting positions . 
Moreover , he added , there is hesitancy on the part of all actors to move decisively . 
He noted that this was visible in the regime 's unwillingness to use the full force of its repressive capabilities to crack down on the opposition once and for all. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) [ORG COMMENT:  ] The [ORG GPO  ] is not [LOC Poland  ] 's [ORG Solidarity  ] , and [LOC Tehran  ] 2010 isn't [LOC Tehran  ] 1978 . 
In other words , it is quite unlikely that the current [MISC Iranian  ] system of government will significantly change in the short-term , and if there were any significant change , it is more likely to be towards a more authoritarian regime than to be towards a more democratic one . 
However , having posited why the [ORG GPO  ] is unlikely to effect fundamental short-term changes in [LOC Iran  ] 's ruling system , it is equally true to say that it is unlikely to go away . 
What makes the preceding important for the USG is the fact that [LOC Iran  ] 's current domestic strife is a political 'black hole' [LOC DUBAI  ] 00000015 006 OF 006 that swallows all other issues , both domestic and foreign , such that until a new homeostasis is reached in [LOC Iran  ] 's political ruling class , progress on issues of bilateral importance will be even more difficult than usual . 
END COMMENT .
