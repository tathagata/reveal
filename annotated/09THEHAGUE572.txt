2008 THE HAGUE 757 Classified By: POLECON Counselor [PER Andrew C. Mann  ] for reasons 1.5 ( b , c ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: The [MISC Dutch  ] generally share [LOC U.S.  ] views on the agenda items for the 12th session of the [ORG Human Rights Council  ] ( [ORG HRC  ] ) . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] are concerned about how to respond to Judge [PER Goldstone  ] 's report on [LOC Israel  ] and [LOC Russia  ] 's proposal to review the [ORG HRC  ] process . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG DUTCH SUPPORT  ] FOR [LOC U.S.  ] POSITIONS: Post delivered reftel A points to key [MISC Dutch  ] MFA contacts , and Pol Deputy met with [PER Edwin Keijzer  ] , senior policy officer in the MFA [ORG Human Rights Directorate  ] , on September 16 . 
[PER Keijzer  ] made the following points: -- Freedom of [ORG Expression:  ] The [MISC Dutch  ] do not want the freedom of expression resolution to hinder the Allied response to the [PER Goldstone  ] report , a higher profile political problem ( see para 3 below ) . 
On the substance , the [MISC Dutch  ] are willing to support [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to find consensus but want wording on part 3bis that could create human rights for a religion . 
In addition , the [MISC Dutch  ] want to find language to broaden the scope of coverage and prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation , not just race and religion . 
Such language would need to be general in nature to avoid creating opposition . 
-- [LOC Colombia  ] resolution on gender discrimination: The [ORG EU  ] has not reached consensus on this resolution . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] hesitate to create a new institution but want to respond to the new laws some nations have enacted in support of discrimination . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] expect to follow the [ORG EU  ] position , which will likely support the resolution . 
-- [ORG Technical Assistance  ] to [LOC Burundi  ] , [LOC Somalia  ] , [LOC Cambodia:  ] The [MISC Dutch  ] support the renewal of these technical assistance mandates . 
For [LOC Somalia  ] , it is important to have a clear mandate with monitoring . 
-- [MISC Russian  ] Proposal on traditional values: The [MISC Dutch  ] agree the [MISC Russian  ] proposal could be problematic in that it could easily water down universal human rights . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] would need revised text to address that issue before supporting the measure. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG DUTCH CONCERNS:  ] Keijzer noted also that the Allied response to the [PER Goldstone  ] report will be difficult . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] 's proposed resolution to simply accept the content and recommendation of the report is difficult to challenge . 
( [PER Note: Subsequently  ] , FM [PER Verhagen  ] stated publicly that he found the [PER Goldstone  ] report one sided , in that it finds fault with [LOC Israel  ] for not stopping violations by [ORG Hamas  ] . 
[PER Verhagen  ] also faults [PER Goldstone  ] for not bringing the report to the [ORG HRC  ] before passing it to the [ORG Security Council  ] . 
End note . 
) The report could result in [ORG ICC  ] and [ORG ICJ  ] referrals for [LOC Israel  ] . 
In addition , the [MISC Dutch  ] are concerned about a [MISC Russian  ] proposal to review the [ORG HRC  ] in [LOC Geneva  ] . 
Responding to a demarche , the [MISC Dutch  ] told [MISC Russian  ] diplomats that a [LOC Geneva  ] discussion would be too regional , with splits among the different regions . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] did not tell the [MISC Russians  ] their view that a [LOC New York  ] discussion would provide for a better balance of power for proponents of human rights .
