REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( SBU ) Although press reports from international media outlets are swirling regarding the possible release next week of convicted [MISC Pan Am 103  ] bomber , [PER Abdel Basset  ] al-Megrahi , local state-run media outlets have not yet offered any commentary on the rumors , although they have reported them . 
" Oya , " a popular and widespread media outlet run by [PER Qadhafi  ] 's son [PER Saif al-Islam  ] , as well as the smaller " [PER Al Watan  ] " newspaper simply detailed that the [MISC Scottish  ] press had printed an article regarding [PER Megrahi  ] 's possible imminent release . 
Meanwhile , online outlet " [LOC Libya  ] al-Youm " reprinted a [ORG Reuters  ] article summarizing the news , with one notable exclusion - the local article , translated into [MISC Arabic  ] , deleted quotes made by family members of [MISC Pan Am 103  ] victims that were included in the original [ORG Reuters  ] piece . 
Other popular local media sources such as " [LOC Qurina  ] " ( print ) and " [PER Jana "  ] ( online ) did not report anything related to [PER Megrahi  ] . 
Unnamed [MISC Libyan  ] officials were cited in the press reports as having acknowledged an agreement with the [ORG Scottish Executive  ] to refrain from comment on the case until [PER Megrahi  ] is released and returned to [MISC Libyan  ] soil . 
2 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The subdued reaction in [LOC Tripoli  ] most likely reflects [LOC Libya  ] 's commitment not to comment on the case before any official decision is made . 
Local contacts did not react to the international media reports , stating that the news was not , in fact , new , and that rumors regarding [PER Megrahi  ] 's release have been circulating for months . 
Post will continue to monitor local reactions - in the press , on the street , and within the government - to the possibility of [PER Megrahi  ] 's release in the near future .
