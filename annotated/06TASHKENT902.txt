Foreign investors can " win " [ORG GOU  ] tenders by arranging them through [PER Salim  ] , who charges a percentage of revenues as a fee . 
Many job applicants have approached the contact , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , asking for introductions to [PER Salim  ] in order to " purchase " a [ORG GOU  ] job . 
( Note: Both public and private sector jobs are routinely " bought " in [LOC Uzbekistan  ] . 
End note .

( [ORG S  ] ) According to the contact , [PER Salim  ] locates foreign and other investors interested in [ORG GOU  ] tenders , putting them in touch with an [MISC Iranian  ] businessman holding [MISC British  ] citizenship .

[ORG GOU  ] JOBS FOR SALE ! ------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) A man named " Abror hoja " brings job applicants to [PER Salim  ] , who discusses the price of the purchase and facilitates the transaction .

[PER Salim  ] works closely with [PER Tursinkhan Hudaibergenov  ] , Deputy Minister of [ORG Internal Affairs  ] for personnel issues , to facilitate [ORG GOU  ] job placements .

( [ORG S  ] ) In one example of [PER Salim  ] 's sway over [ORG GOU  ] personnel decisions , a regional mayor appealed to him for help retaining his job after he came under pressure to resign .

According to the contact , [PER Salim  ] instructed [PER Teshebaev  ] to make a payment to his brother , [PER Azamjon Abduvaliyev  ] , in order to retain the job . 
But after the payment was made , [PER Salim  ] reportedly mocked the amount of money [PER Teshebaev  ] offered , TASHKENT 00000902 002.2 OF 002 saying he " couldn't eat a meal " for that amount. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Comment: [PER Salim  ] 's role in securing [ORG GOU  ] tenders and jobs sheds further light on the close connections between organized crime and the [ORG GOU  ] ( reftel ) . 
Corruption is rampant in the [ORG GOU  ] . 
Tenders and government positions can be fairly easily secured by paying the right amount of money to the appropriate individual , leading to a situation in which unqualified individuals have every incentive to engage in further corrupt activity to pay off the large debts they usually incur making down payments on the jobs .
