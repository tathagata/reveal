Chapman  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b and d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG SUMMARY: Drug  ] trafficking is a growing problem in [LOC Mozambique  ] , with illegal drugs entering via air and sea routes from [LOC South Asia  ] and [LOC South America  ] . 
Porous borders , lack of law enforcement resources , and rampant corruption allow drug traffickers to freely transit the country . 
END SUMMARY ---------- Air Routes ---------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The primary route for cocaine is by air to [LOC Maputo  ] from [LOC Brazil  ] via [LOC Johannesburg  ] , [LOC Lisbon  ] or [LOC Luanda  ] . 
On arrival passengers and baggage do not pass through immigration and customs , which allows them to avoid he improved security at the airports of origin . 
Drugs ( mostly cocaine ) are smuggled overland to [LOC South Africa  ] for local [MISC South African  ] consumption or onward to [LOC Europe  ] . 
Cocaine is often smuggled by mules and/or in suitcases with hidden compartments . 
The drug traffickers routinely bribe [LOC Mozambique  ] police , immigration and customs officials in order to get the drugs into the country . 
The decrease in drug related arrests at [LOC Maputo International Airport  ] is not attributable to improved interdiction efforts but rather increased police and customs involvement in drug smuggling . 
A high level law enforcement official admits most police drug seizures are not reported to his office because traffickers and police make on-the-spot arrangements to allow the drugs to continue to flow . 
Police and customs officials routinely detain drug smugglers and are then bribed to release the smugglers and the drugs are confiscated and resold . 
[PER Domingos Tivane  ] , the Director of Customs , is directly involved in facilitating drug shipments . 
[PER Tivane  ] has amassed a personal fortune in excess of a million dollars , to include numerous investments around [LOC Mozambique.  ] ---------- Sea Routes ---------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) Transport by sea is the preferred route for hashish , mandrax and heroin shipments , often involving large quantities . 
Drugs come from [LOC Pakistan  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC India  ] . 
They are then loaded onto a vessel that sails to [LOC Dar Es-Salam  ] , [LOC Tanzania  ] , or [LOC Mombasa  ] , [LOC Kenya  ] . 
Drugs are often concealed in containers with legitimate goods and are often offloaded and sent via land to [LOC Mozambique  ] . 
Alternatively , the vessel offloads its cargo in the Ports of [LOC Maputo  ] , [LOC Beira  ] and especially [LOC Nacala  ] . 
Drugs are then smuggled overland to [LOC South Africa  ] or onward via air , to the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Europe.  ] ----------------------------------- Two [ORG Main Drug Trafficking Networks  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) There are two large drug trafficking networks that operate in [LOC Mozambique  ] . 
Both of these networks have ties to [LOC South East Asia  ] . 
[PER Mohamed Bashir Suleiman  ] ( [ORG MBS  ] ) is the head of a well financed [ORG MAPUTO  ] 00001291 002 OF 002 organized crime and money laundering network centered on the family owned and managed business conglomerate [ORG Grupo MBS  ] . 
[PER Suleiman  ] uses [ORG Grupo MBS  ] and proxies like [MISC Rassul Trading  ] , run by [PER Ghulam Rassul  ] , and [ORG Niza Group  ] , owned by the [PER Ayoub  ] family , to smuggle drugs from [LOC Pakistan  ] via [LOC Dubai  ] in containers carrying televisions , electrical equipment , cooking oil and automobiles . 
The [PER Suleiman  ] family has connections in [LOC South Africa  ] , [LOC Somalia  ] , [LOC Pakistan  ] , [LOC Latin America  ] and [LOC Portugal  ] , and maintains a complex structure of businesses with a wide variety of commercial activities that serve as a cover for a multitude of illegal activities . 
[PER Suleiman  ] has a close relationship with former President of [LOC Mozambique  ] [PER Joaquim Chissano  ] and current President [PER Armando Guebuza  ] , and enjoys ties to senior level [MISC Mozambican  ] officials , including the Direct or of Customs , [PER Tivane  ] . 
[ORG Grupo MBS  ] and the [PER Suleiman  ] family reportedly have connections in the [PER Ibrahim Dawood  ] international drug syndicate. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) [PER Ghulam Rassul  ] Moti is a [LOC Mozambique  ] based ethnic [MISC South Asian  ] narcotics trafficker who has smuggled hashish and heroin in the [LOC Nampula  ] province of [LOC Northern Mozambique  ] since at least 1993 . 
He has been linked to several prominent international narcotics traffickers and uses these relationships and his political influence to avoid customs and police inspections at the seaports and borders . 
Moti owns [MISC Rassul Trading Co.  ] and [ORG Grupo ARJ  ] which are major narcotics importers in [LOC Nacala  ] , and suspected in the trafficking of persons , mainly [MISC Pakistanis  ] . 
Post is also seeing increased cooperation between [LOC West  ] and [MISC East African  ] based narcotics networks with [LOC Mozambique  ] drug networks . 
The main drug organizations are rumored to support extremist [MISC Islamist  ] elements in [LOC Mozambique.  ] --------------------------------------------- ---- Corruption of [ORG Senior Level Government Officials  ] --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) A porous border , lack of resources for law enforcement as well as endemic corruption among [LOC Mozambique  ] 's senior level officials leads to a situation where drug traffickers are able to freely transit the country . 
Mid-level [MISC Mozambican  ] officials are afraid to go after people involved in the major drug networks because they know they have connections to senior level government officials . 
Senior members of the ruling [ORG FRELIMO  ] party are seeking to hide the level of corruption from the press , the electorate and the international donor community . 
As a high level law enforcement official also said recently in private , 'Some fish are too big to catch.'
