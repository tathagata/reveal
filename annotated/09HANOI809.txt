( C ) SUMMARY: Preparations are already underway for major leadership changes in [LOC Vietnam  ] as the [ORG Communist Party  ] gears up for its [ORG Eleventh Party Congress  ] in January 2011 . 
As many as six of the [MISC Politburo’s  ] fifteen members are expected to retire , including the General Secretary , State President , and [ORG National Assembly Chair  ] . 
Conventional wisdom identifies [ORG CPV Standing  ] Secretary [PER Truong Tan Sang  ] and Prime Minister [PER Nguyen Tan Dung  ] as the frontrunners to replace [PER Nong Duc Manh  ] as General Secretary . 
If [PER Dung  ] does not become General Secretary , odds are he will remain as Prime Minister . 
Politburo members since 1996 , [PER Dung  ] and [PER Sang  ] have amassed unparalleled influence in [MISC Vietnam’s Party-state  ] apparatus ; they are arguably the two most powerful political figures in the country today . 
The problem is that , though rivals , [PER Dung  ] and [PER Sang  ] are also too alike for comfort -- both are Southerners , both former [ORG HCMC Party Secretaries  ] . 
[LOC Vietnam’s  ] enduring regionalism argues that one , likely [PER Sang  ] , will be frustrated in 2011 . 
If [PER Dung  ] keeps his seat as PM , the two strongest contenders for General Secretary are current [ORG National Assembly Chair  ] [PER Nguyen Phu Trong  ] and -- more radically -- the [MISC Politburo’s  ] newest member , the conservative head of the [ORG CPV Ideology and Education Commission  ] , To [PER Huy Rua.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) COMMENT: Neither PM [PER Dung  ] nor Standing Secretary [PER Sang  ] is a champion of political reform in the manner of the late PM [PER Vo Van Kiet  ] . 
But they are known commodities: pragmatic , market-oriented , and in favor of steady , incremental advances in [LOC Vietnam’s  ] relationship with the [LOC United States  ] . 
[PER Trong  ] has adopted a similar approach as [ORG NA Chair  ] . 
Rua may be a different story altogether . 
His elevation to the [MISC Politburo  ] both reflects and reinforces a hard-line trend that has been increasingly evident since the crackdown on journalists reporting on the [MISC PMU-18  ] corruption scandal almost exactly one year ago . 
What role he plays in [LOC Vietnam’s  ] leadership transition will say much about whether political liberalization -- on hold for now -- will resume after 2011 or will remain stifled . 
END SUMMARY AND COMMENT . 
Preparations Underway for the 2011 [ORG Party Congress  ] --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Unlike the [ORG Ninth Party Plenum  ] , which installed new members of the [ORG CPV Politburo  ] , [ORG Secretariat  ] , and [ORG Central Committee  ] ( ref . 
A ) , the [ORG Tenth Plenum  ] , held this July , produced virtually no new personnel or policy decisions . 
Instead , according to contacts with access to the [ORG Central Committee  ] , the [ORG Plenum  ] focused mainly on preparations for the [ORG Eleventh Party Congress  ] in 2011 . 
Following the [ORG Plenum  ] , the [ORG CPV  ] announced that the once-every-five-year [ORG Congress  ] would be held January 2011 , a somewhat earlier date than usual to allow for [ORG National Assembly  ] elections later in the year . 
More importantly , our contacts said that the [ORG Congress  ] finished assignments to various subcommittees , including bodies responsible for drafting the [MISC Congress’s  ] main written product , the “Political [MISC Report.” Initial  ] drafting on some of the sections , including the portion on [MISC Vietnam’s  ] foreign relations , began several months ago , according to [LOC XXXXXXXXXXXX.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Of the subcommittees , the one subject to most fervid speculation is the [ORG Subcommittee  ] for [ORG Personnel Appointments  ] . 
Chaired officially by General Secretary [PER Nong Duc Manh  ] , but under the day-to-day supervision of the [ORG Central Committee’s Organizational Affairs Department Chair  ] , [PER Ho Duc Viet  ] , this subcommittee is charged with preparing the list of candidates for the [ORG Eleventh Central Committee  ] and , ultimately , the next [MISC Politburo  ] . 
[PER Viet  ] began the formal process at a “national conference” in [LOC Hanoi  ] , August 25-26 , in which he instructed grass-roots cadres to begin organizing local and [ORG Provincial-  ] level [ORG Party Congresses  ] . 
The actual work of the [ORG Appointments Subcommittee  ] is kept extremely [ORG HANOI  ] 00000809 002 OF 004 close hold , particularly as it affects upper-level personnel , and will be subject to change until the [ORG Tenth Central Committee’s  ] final plenary session , immediately before the January 2011 [ORG Congress  ] itself . 
As a sign that ideological conservatives continue to consolidate their position , the [ORG Subcommittee  ] will take as its guidance directives put forward in the [ORG Ninth Plenum  ] , including admonitions about the pernicious effects of [MISC Western-oriented  ] “self-evolution” ( ref . 
B ) , sources familiar with the [MISC Plenum’s  ] internal deliberations say . 
Additionally , the [ORG Tenth Plenum  ] instructed [ORG Provincial Party Secretaries  ] to compile reports explaining how changes over the past ten years had either contributed to “perfecting socialism” or “regressing into capitalism , ” according to the new [ORG Can Tho Party  ] Secretary . 
Retirements Will Leave Key Openings ---------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Personnel Subcommittee  ] will have several important vacancies to consider . 
The [ORG CPV’s Ninth Congress  ] ( 2001 ) established an age limit of 60 for first-time [MISC Politburo  ] members and 65 for those returning for a repeat term . 
The latter limit was increased to 67 just prior to the [ORG Tenth Congress  ] as an exception to allow [PER Manh  ] , who at the time was 66 , to return as General Secretary . 
Nearly all of our contacts predicted the present leadership would adhere to these age limits in 2011 . 
If the limits are respected , five key [MISC Politburo  ] members face mandatory retirement: General Secretary [PER Manh  ] ( age 71 in 2011 ) , State President [PER Nguyen Minh Triet  ] ( 69 ) , [ORG National Assembly Chair  ] [PER Nguyen Phu Trong  ] ( 67 ) , [PER DPM  ] and Foreign Minister [PER Pham Gia Khiem  ] ( 67 ) , and [ORG DPM  ] [PER Truong Vinh  ] [PER Trong  ] ( 69 ) . 
In addition , a sixth member of the [MISC Politburo  ] , [ORG CPV Inspection Commission Chair  ] [PER Nguyen Van Chi  ] , will be 66 and is reported to be in extremely poor health . 
A minority view among our contacts held that the 67-year age exception would be extended to [ORG NA Chair  ] [PER Trong  ] if he were selected as General Secretary . 
[ORG Consensus Front  ] Runners: [PER Truong Tan Sang  ] and [PER Nguyen Tan Dung  ] --------------------------------------------- --------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Most observers identify PM [PER Nguyen Tan Dung  ] and the head of the powerful [ORG CPV Secretariat  ] , Standing Secretary [PER Truong Tan Sang  ] , as the leading contenders for Secretary General in 2011 . 
In terms of experience , authority , and potential career longevity , [PER Dung  ] and [PER Sang  ] stand head and shoulders above their counterparts on the [MISC Politburo  ] . 
Both have achieved dominant positions in what many now consider almost as competing wings within the [MISC Party-  ] state apparatus: [PER Dung  ] through the [ORG Office of Government  ] , government ministries , and his control over [MISC Vietnam’s  ] largest state-owned enterprises ; [PER Sang  ] through the [ORG Central Committee Commissions  ] . 
[PER Dung  ] and [PER Sang  ] are also in the best position to provide the continuity of leadership that the [ORG Party  ] has consistently said it needs . 
The two entered the [MISC Politburo  ] in 1996 , which gives them the longest tenure of any member likely to serve through 2011 . 
At the same time , at 60 , they are relatively young and would be eligible to serve two terms as General Secretary , were the 67-year age-limit exemption invoked. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Of the two , [PER Sang  ] is more frequently mentioned as a replacement for GS [PER Manh  ] . 
As Standing Secretary , [PER Sang  ] is responsible for the day-to-day running of Party affairs and , our contacts say , has consolidated his hold over the [ORG CPV’s Central Committee  ] commissions , which retain an important role in setting broad policy goals and in personnel decisions . 
Though his tenure as [ORG HCMC Party  ] Chief was somewhat tainted by the “Nam [MISC Cam”  ] organized crime scandal , [PER Sang  ] is now widely acknowledged as the Party’s primary power broker on a wide range of issues , including on economic matters . 
Meeting with a delegation of industry representatives from the [ORG U.S.-ASEAN Business Council  ] in May , for example , [PER Sang  ] was able to comment authoritatively , in detail and without notes , on topics ranging from civilian nuclear cooperation to energy pricing to regulations on tenders and procurement . 
[PER Sang  ] has also intervened to stop , at least temporarily , several business [ORG HANOI  ] 00000809 003 OF 004 deals that were rumored to be corrupt and that had aroused public criticism. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Sang  ] has in some respects already eclipsed the General Secretary , according to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
Others agree that [PER Manh  ] has ceded authority to [PER Sang  ] , but offer a slightly different interpretation . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] emphasized that [PER Manh  ] himself remains in overall command , but has removed himself from most policy decisions , choosing instead to focus on internal Party building . 
Ambassador [PER Mitsuo Sakaba  ] , who accompanied [PER Manh  ] on his April visit to [LOC Japan  ] , told us that the General Secretary appeared disengaged in his meeting with [MISC Japanese  ] PM [PER Taro Aso  ] , reading verbatim and in a monotone a 30-minute prepared statement passed to him by a staff-member ; the General Secretary only really showed interest when he was taken to an agricultural site outside [LOC Tokyo  ] . 
Whatever the cause of [MISC Manh’s  ] detachment , our contacts agree that [PER Sang  ] has already assumed many of [MISC Manh’s  ] normal responsibilities as General Secretary. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) While PM [PER Dung  ] has frequently been mentioned as a contender for General Secretary , a series of setbacks may have frustrated his ambitions to ascend to the top spot . 
[PER Dung  ] appears to have been stung by criticisms over his early advocacy for [MISC Chinese  ] investment in bauxite projects in the [LOC Central Highlands  ] ( ref . 
C ) , a controversy that has been led publicly by General [PER Vo Nguyen Giap  ] , but which insiders say has been exploited by [PER Sang  ] and others as a proxy to undermine [PER Dung  ] ( ref . 
D ) . 
In the most recent [ORG Plenum  ] , the Prime Minister reportedly also came under criticism for his government’s poor performance on corruption , education , and health care . 
Ultimately , Dung’s biggest weakness is the simple fact that his power base derives from efforts to strengthen the government/ state , according to contacts such as [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
Dung’s efforts to consolidate power within the [ORG Office of Government  ] have alienated many in the [ORG Secretariat  ] and the commissions of the [ORG Central Committee  ] , the [MISC CPV’s  ] traditional centers of power , according to [MISC Eastern European  ] diplomatic contacts with regular exposure to the upper/middle ranks of the [ORG CPV  ] hierarchy. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Nevertheless , most contacts suggest that [PER Dung  ] remains well positioned to remain Prime Minister ; indeed , this may have been his goal all along . 
Though stung by criticism , the Prime Minister has developed an unprecedentedly tight hold over the state bureaucracy . 
Just as critically , [PER Dung  ] -- a former wartime military medic and police official -- retains strong backing within the [ORG Ministries of Public Security and Defense  ] , support that has likely only been reinforced during the most recent crackdown on political dissent ( ref E ) . 
Perhaps as an effort to showcase this , [PER Dung  ] has over the past months made several well-publicized visits to military commands and has addressed MPS functions . 
[PER Dung  ] also maintains extremely close contacts with MPS Minister [PER Le Hong Anh  ] , though [PER Anh  ] may not continue in his present position past 2011 ( septel ) . 
[PER Regionalism:  ] Why the Conventional [MISC Wisdom Might be Wrong  ] --------------------------------------------- ---------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) If conventional wisdom prevails , [MISC Southerners  ] would for the first time occupy the two most important positions in [MISC Vietnam’s Party-state  ] structure , and would be in a position to keep their jobs for an additional ten years -- an untenable situation from the standpoint of the [MISC CPV’s  ] traditional power brokers in the [LOC North  ] . 
Since Party strongman [PER Le Duan’s  ] death in 1986 , the General Secretary has always come from the [LOC North  ] , the Prime Minister from the [LOC South  ] ; there has been an additional effort , less consistently applied , to have the third position in [MISC Vietnam’s  ] traditional power troika , State President , come from the Center . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] argue that regionalism is less and less correlated with ideological differences and of late has [ORG HANOI  ] 00000809 004 OF 004 faded in importance . 
Additionally , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and others maintain , there are important factional divisions among [MISC Southerners  ] themselves: [PER Sang  ] , [PER Dung  ] , and State President [MISC Triet  ] may all be former [ORG HCMC Party Chiefs  ] , but they are not necessarily allies . 
There is much truth to this ; however , our assessment is that having both the PM and President come from the [LOC South  ] was an extremely hard pill for many [MISC Northerners  ] to swallow in 2006 , made palatable only because the top spot was held by a Northerner . 
Losing the positions of both General Secretary and Prime Minister would be too much for some to contemplate . 
( Comment: It is also important to keep in mind that factionalism , of which regionalism remains the most potent fault line , increasingly is no longer about ideology -- it is about power , patronage , and wealth . 
End comment . 
) The [MISC Dark-Horse Contenders  ] ------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Neither [PER Sang  ] nor [PER Dung  ] is likely to step aside without a struggle . 
If one is forced to sacrifice his ambitions , it is likely to be [PER Sang  ] . 
If [PER Sang  ] does not become General Secretary , a frequently mentioned alternative could be [ORG National Assembly Chair  ] Nguyen [PER Phu Trong  ] , who has ably managed [MISC Vietnam’s  ] increasingly assertive national legislature and is a known commodity , having also served credibly as [ORG Hanoi Party  ] Secretary . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] confided that [PER Trong  ] is lobbying to have the 67 limit apply not just to the position of General Secretary , but to each of the “four pillars”: GS , PM , State Secretary , and [PER NA Chair.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) A more radical choice could be the newest [MISC Politburo  ] member , the hard-line chair of the [ORG CPV Ideology and Educational Commission  ] ( [ORG IEC  ] ) To Huy [PER Rua  ] . 
It would be unusual for a recently appointed [MISC Politburo  ] member to ascend to the top of the [ORG CPV  ] apparatus so soon ; however , [PER Rua  ] has developed a formidable curriculum vitae . 
[PER Rua  ] has been a member of the [ORG Secretariat  ] since 2006 , which puts him at the heart of [ORG CPV  ] policy making ; as the long-serving [ORG IEC Chair  ] and as a former head of the [ORG Ho Chi Minh Political Academy  ] , he has impeccable ideological credentials ; and , perhaps most importantly , as the former [ORG Party Chair  ] for [LOC Haiphong  ] , [PER Rua  ] has “executive experience” running a major provincial-level city . 
We have no information to corroborate an assertion by [MISC Australian  ] academic [PER Carlye Thayer  ] that [PER Rua  ] is an ally of [PER Sang  ] . 
Rather , [PER Rua  ] is considered to be a protege of fellow [PER Thanh Hoa  ] stalwart , the hard-line former General Secretary [PER Le Kha Phieu  ] . 
Whatever the case , [ORG Rua’s  ] public profile has risen appreciably in the weeks after the most recent [ORG Plenum  ] . 
On August 3 , for example , [ORG Rua’s  ] views on “self-evolution” made the front-page piece in the leading [ORG CPV  ] daily , [ORG Nhan Dan  ] . 
On August 30 , state media lavished extensive coverage on his visit to [ORG HCMC  ] , where he exhorted the country’s youth to follow the example of [ORG Ho Chi Minh  ] . 
[PER Rua  ] was also shown chairing regional organizing meetings laying the groundwork for provincial [ORG Party Congresses.  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) If [PER Dung  ] , on the other hand , is unable to retain his seat -- and [PER Sang  ] , in turn , ascends to the position of General Secretary -- this would likely produce a reversal of the normal regional balance , with a Northerner becoming Prime Minister . 
But here the field is , if anything , even narrower . 
For the past 20 years , [MISC Vietnam’s  ] Prime Ministers have come from the ranks of serving Deputy Prime Minister: of [MISC Vietnam’s  ] five current [PER DPMs  ] , only three are on the [MISC Politburo  ] , and of them , two are scheduled to retire in 2011 , leaving only Standing [PER DPM Nguyen  ] Sing [PER Hung  ] . 
[PER Hung  ] is a Northerner and an economic technocrat , and has the additional advantage of being one of PM Dung’s bitterest rivals , according to several contacts . 
However , [PER Hung  ] is himself an unpopular figure . 
When the newly convened [ORG National Assembly  ] met in 2007 to formally ratify the Party’s selections for PM , [PER DPMs  ] , and government ministers -- normally a perfunctory ritual -- only 58% voted to approve [PER DPM Hung  ] , a shockingly low figure considering that 92% of the [MISC NA’s  ] deputies are Party members.</pre></code>
