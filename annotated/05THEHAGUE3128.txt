End Summary . 
BREAKING BREAD -------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Mission staff attended large banquets and small family dinners . 
The [ORG Charge  ] 's [MISC Iftar  ] dinner for 45 key contacts included many [MISC Muslim  ] ambassadors and local [MISC Muslim  ] leaders . 
Highlights were broadcast on a local [MISC Muslim  ] television station . 
Mission staff attended five other [MISC Iftar  ] dinners hosted by [MISC Muslim  ] families , and participated in the country 's first national [ORG Ramadan Festival  ] - itself organized by [PER Ahmed Larouz  ] , a 2005 IVLP participant . 
Emboffs shared [ORG IIP' Muslim Life  ] in [LOC America  ] booklet at family [MISC Iftar  ] dinners . 
FOOD FOR THOUGHT ---------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [MISC American  ] speakers added their perspectives to the [MISC Dutch  ] discussion on integration and religion . 
Dr. [PER Kamran Ali  ] , an [MISC American  ] Fulbright scholar at the [ORG University of Leiden  ] 's [ORG International Institute  ] for the [ORG Study of Islam  ] in the [MISC Modern World  ] ( [ORG ISIM  ] ) , lectured at the university about multiculturalism . 
Visiting [MISC American  ] speaker [PER Shabbir Mansuri  ] of the [ORG California-based Council  ] on [ORG Islamic Education  ] addressed [MISC Dutch-Moroccan  ] students and young leaders in four workshops on Religion and Citizenship in a Democracy . 
The [ORG Charge  ] hosted a dinner for Dr. [PER Jessica Stern  ] , Professor of Public Policy at [ORG Harvard  ] and author of Terrorism in the Name of [PER God  ] , who discussed radicalization in the [LOC Netherlands  ] with dinner guests including national and local government officials , and academics . 
WHAT WE HEARD ------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Emboffs heard repeatedly that ethnic tensions in The [LOC Netherlands  ] are much worse now than they have ever been . 
A Moroccan-born [MISC Dutch  ] national who works for the [ORG City of Amsterdam  ] , in attendance at an [MISC Iftar  ] dinner , told emboff that he was considering moving to [LOC Spain  ] . 
His rationale was that , even though the situation in [LOC Spain  ] was not better for [MISC Moroccans  ] , at least there he would truly be a foreigner . 
Even though we tell people in [LOC Holland  ] that we are [MISC Moroccan  ] , we really are [MISC Dutch  ] . 
We never say it though . 
They [ native [MISC Dutch  ] ] would look at us weird if we did , said the official. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Views of the [LOC US  ] vary based on personal experience and views of larger political events . 
On the personal level , though some parents may have a favorable view of the [LOC US  ] stemming from fond memories of [LOC US  ] assistance during their youth in [LOC Morocco  ] , [MISC Moroccan  ] youth in the [LOC Netherlands  ] lack similar positive experiences of the [LOC U.S.  ] , and according to one observer , many parents don't share their experiences with their children . 
On the other hand , one middle-aged [MISC Dutch Moroccan  ] man said , What happened with relations between the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [MISC Arab  ] world ? 
Things used to be so good . 
Why are [LOC U.S.  ] policies against us now ? 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The broad array of events provided an excellent opportunity to listen and to bring our message of tolerance to various [MISC Muslim  ] audiences . 
Our embassy-hosted events also brought [MISC Dutch  ] government officials and [MISC Muslim  ] leaders together , something both sides have complained does not happen enough . 
The publication on [ORG Muslim Life  ] in [LOC America  ] was well-received , and an eye-opener for people who knew nothing of that aspect of the [MISC American  ] experience . 
Commenting on the Embassy 's [MISC Iftar  ] , [PER Mohammed Sini  ] , Director of the [MISC Islam  ] and [ORG Citizenship Foundation  ] said Every gathering presents an opportunity to solve problems between [MISC Muslims  ] , [MISC Christians  ] , [MISC Jews  ] and others . 
They all have to find a way to keep talking to each other . 
Embassy will continue to foster that discussion .
