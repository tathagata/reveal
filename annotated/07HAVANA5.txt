( C ) Summary: [MISC Cuban  ] media carried a [MISC New Years  ] message from [PER Fidel Castro  ] noting the passing of 48 years since he assumed power , and also announcing that he is still on a slow path to recovery from his medical crisis . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] still believes [PER Castro  ] is terminally ill , even if the report from [MISC Spanish  ] doctor [PER Jose Luis Garcia Sabrido  ] 's visit says he does not have cancer . 
[MISC Cuban  ] media made no mention of the [MISC Spanish  ] doctor 's visit . 
A contact close to [PER Castro  ] 's sister reports that the sick dictator is not mentally fit to retake control of the government , even if he physically recovers . 
[MISC New Years  ] was otherwise a low-key event in [LOC Havana  ] . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) The new calendar year is the occasion for the [MISC Cuban  ] regime to celebrate one more year of its own ascent to power--January 1 , 1959 being the day that [PER Castro  ] 's predecessor [PER Fulgencio Batista  ] , fled [LOC Cuba  ] into exile . 
2007 is officially dubbed " Year 49 of the Revolution , " a less thematic name that 2006 , which was the " Year of the [MISC Energy Revolution  ] . 
" [ORG GOC  ] media on December 31 all carried [PER Fidel Castro  ] 's New Year 's message , which is essentially a pep talk to the country and his own medical status report . 
It is unknown if he wrote or even edited the text . 
Highlights are as follows: -- We 've completed a year of great effort and encouraging results in the [ORG Battle of Ideas  ] and programs in the [MISC Energy Revolution...We  ] were dignified hosts of the [LOC Non-Aligned Summit  ] , and continued our tenacious resistance to the empire 's blockade and aggression.. . 
-- I thank you all for your affection and support . 
Regarding my recovery , I have always warned that it would be a prolonged process , but it 's far from being a lost battle . 
I cooperate as a disciplined patient with the dedicated team of doctors that take care of me . 
-- I have not stopped keeping abreast of important events and news . 
I exchange ideas with my closest collaborators whenever it has been necessary on matters of vital importance. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Postscript to [MISC Spanish  ] doctor visit: [PER Dr. Garcia Sabrido  ] 's [ORG Madrid  ] media interview December 26 provided some new information , although seen through the prism of [MISC Cuban  ] popular opinion , is tainted by [PER Garcia Sabrido  ] 's close association with the regime and the [PER Castro  ] family . 
[ORG USINT Human Rights Assistant  ] on December 29 visited [PER Teresita Paz  ] , wife of the late [PER Gustavo Arcos  ] ( former [ORG GOC  ] official and later a dissident ) ; [PER Teresita  ] is friends with one of [PER Fidel Castro  ] 's sisters and has contact with her on a regular basis . 
[PER Teresita  ] characterized the [MISC Spanish  ] doctor 's visit to [LOC Cuba  ] a " farce , " adding that the [PER Castro  ] sister said just a few days ago that [PER Fidel  ] 's mind is now completely gone , and he is never going to be able to get back to work . 
" [MISC Pro-democracy  ] leader [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told P-E Counselor December 28th that the [MISC Spanish  ] doctor 's visit proved that [LOC Cuba  ] is not the medical superpower it makes itself out to be , which was why [ORG GOC  ] media refrained from giving the visit any publicity . 
Independent journalist [PER Miriam Leiva  ] made the same point in an op-ed column on December 29th. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG USINT Health Unit View: USINT  ] 's Nurse Practitioner , with experience and training in oncology , has provided the following updated assessment of [PER Fidel Castro  ] 's health: " Based on the photos we 've seen , [PER Fidel Castro  ] appears very weakened and cachectic , and it was reported publicly that he lost 20 kilograms in just six weeks from his July 28 emergency abdominal surgery due to hemorrhaging . 
His October 28 appearance , in a five-minute video , shows him in an over-sized jogging suit and walking two-three steps as if he were a marionette swinging his arms robot-style to somehow show strength . 
But it was so obviously overstated as to almost be comical . 
Although his diagnosis is a " state secret , " it appeared and still appears he is terminally ill -- having lost over ten percent of his body weight in such a short time and not being strong enough to walk ; plus his last public words over a month ago were mostly nonsensical babble . 
[LOC HAVANA  ] 00000005 002.3 OF 002 Given the statistical odds of a colon , lung , or prostate malignancy for an erstwhile smoker 80 years of age , I was leaning towards a metastatic colon or otherwise upper abdominal cancer with approximately six months to live from the date of the surgery . 
But , if the [MISC Spanish  ] doctor is to be believed , then [PER Castro  ] may have had a perforated viscus ( bowel ) with an inflammatory mass and septic peritonitis ( bacteria strewn throughout organs ) . 
The differential diagnosis includes: -- Perforated peptic ulcer -- Perforated diverticulum -- Necrotic gall bladder -- [PER Mesenteric ischemia  ] ( compromised blood flow ) of the colon , with necrosis and perforation . 
All this points to a very sick individual , whose recovery is made that much more difficult by the weight loss and possible sepsis. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Comment: Embassy [ORG Madrid  ] 's report places [PER Garcia Sabrido  ] 's medical reputation above his regime sympathies , which leads us to believe that the [MISC Cuban  ] medical team treating [PER Castro  ] may be able to keep him alive longer than we originally estimated . 
Such a medical diagnosis leaves the [MISC Raul-Castro-led  ] clique currently in charge for an extended period of limbo , characterized by stresses and strains in the palace and popular expectation that 2007 should be a year of change and economic improvement . 
It will be nearly impossible for anything good to happen ( economy , human rights , international relations ) as long as this limbo period keeps running .
