[ORG Summary: Weekend  ] media reaction to the [LOC U.S.  ] decision to realign [ORG Keflavik Naval Air Station  ] ( [ORG NASKEF  ] ) took a sober turn as politicians and pundits assessed the cost of this development to their state 's security and treasury . 
The national newspaper of record , whose editor is close to former PM [PER David Oddsson  ] , adopted an especially harsh line . 
Other coverage was more straightforward or even ironic , tapping what appears to be pent-up journalistic desire to imagine [LOC Iceland  ] post-NASKEF . 
End summary. ----------------------- Five Stages of Mourning ----------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
If the universal stages of mourning are denial , anger , bargaining , depression , and acceptance , then some members of the [MISC Icelandic  ] intelligentsia have now entered the anger stage . 
Arguably [LOC Reykjavik  ] had been in denial from 2003 ( or even earlier ) until March 15 . 
Post still anticipates eager [MISC Icelandic  ] entry into bargaining as soon as a [LOC U.S.  ] negotiating team can come to [LOC Reykjavik  ] . 
Weekend commentators meanwhile threw some brickbats: -- [PER Morgunbladid  ] ( national newspaper of record , center-right , supports governing coalition ; its editor is a close friend of former Prime Minister [PER David Oddsson  ] ) : In an editorial March 18: " Even though the [LOC United States  ] made a unilateral decision to withdraw the helicopters and fighters , it cannot make a unilateral decision to remain here . 
In an interview with [PER Morgunbladid  ] yesterday , [PER Carol van Voorst  ] , the new [LOC U.S.  ] Ambassador to [LOC Iceland  ] , said that a new chapter in reliable defense cooperation would now commence . 
Really ? 
What chapter is that ? 
The [ORG U.S. Foreign Service  ] has acquired great skill in saying a lot of fine words about nothing at all... . 
( I ) t would be advisable for the [LOC U.S.  ] Ambassador to avoid any form of flattery right now . 
We can see through empty words . 
" In an op-ed March 19: " [PER Robert Loftis  ] 's statements in [PER Morgunbladid  ] yesterday are unconvincing: he said there was no point in having military aircraft stationed in [LOC Iceland  ] , given the current situation....The cooperation that [PER Loftis  ] talked about probably involves only a continuation of the current cooperation between [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Icelandic  ] customs authorities , police , and border inspection authorities , which is important of course , but which cannot replace air defense....The real import of the [LOC U.S.  ] decision...might therefore be that the [LOC United States  ] intends to shift the cost of airspace monitoring for [LOC Iceland  ] onto the other [ORG NATO  ] countries . 
" In a somewhat more constructive editorial March 20: " Even though the [LOC United States  ] has long wanted the four fighters for different duties in other parts of the world , it has planes in [LOC Britain  ] that could maintain regular surveillance flights to [LOC Iceland  ] . 
[LOC Iceland  ] could then take over [ORG Keflavik Airport  ] and its operation , and the military base area would no longer be under [LOC U.S.  ] control , nor would there be an `insignificant number of [LOC U.S.  ] personnel' there , to quote [LOC U.S.  ] representatives . 
The fighters that perform surveillance duties for [LOC Iceland  ] could use the services at [ORG Keflavik Airport  ] . 
There is every reason for the [ORG Icelandic Government  ] to propose this alternative before negotiating the airspace monitoring that [ORG NATO  ] now provides... . 
" -- In a March 20 Frettabladid ( largest circulation daily , center-left , sympathetic to opposition ) article reporting [ORG Social Democratic Alliance Chair  ] [PER Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir  ] 's explanation of why she has appointed former Foreign Minister ( and former Ambassador to the [LOC United States  ] ) [PER Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson  ] to head a defense working group: " It is time for [LOC Iceland  ] to formulate an independent policy on defense and security that reflects national interests in a changing world . 
It is urgent that [LOC Iceland  ] take the initiative in shaping this policy , given the turning point in defense and security that has now been reached with the [ORG U.S. Government  ] 's unilateral violation of the defense agreement . 
" ------------- Looking Ahead ------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
Some commentators are beginning to consider future force structure: -- Under the headline " [LOC Iceland  ] should be offered air policing , " Frettabladid March 18 quoted sources at [ORG NATO  ] referring to air policing as effected in the [LOC Baltic States  ] and [LOC Slovenia  ] as a valid option for [LOC Iceland  ] . 
[MISC Icelandic  ] historian [PER Valur Ingimundarson  ] , who specializes in defense issues , points out that the [MISC F-15  ] 's rarely carry weapons but that the air policing jets do . 
-- Under the headline " Halldor suspected [LOC U.S.  ] military would leave , " Frettabladid reported March 19: " Halldor [PER Asgrimsson  ] says that he had suspected that the [LOC U.S.  ] would withdraw their military force . 
He therefore stated at a [ORG Progressive Party  ] meeting that [LOC Iceland  ] would never force the [LOC U.S.  ] military to stay in [LOC Iceland  ] if they did not want to stay . 
Mr. [PER Asgrimsson  ] says: `I had expected it to come to pass during the present negotiations , but I had imagined it to be in a different fashion...Now we know and we can work our way forward from this point.' 
Mr. [PER Asgrimsson  ] could not say whether it will be an aluminum smelter or some other solution but he stated that the departure of the defense force could possibly justify special and temporary measures to ensure employment in the ( [LOC Sudurnes  ] ) region . 
" -- [PER Morgunbladid  ] added in a page-one report March 20: " A seven-person working group will be formed to look into the future of jobs in [LOC Sudurnes  ] region . 
The group will most likely include four government representatives and three regional representatives . 
Yesterday municipal representatives from [LOC Reykjanesbaer  ] and [LOC Sandgerdi  ] met with Prime Minister Halldor [PER Asgrimsson  ] and Minister for Foreign Affairs Geir H. [PER Haarde....Arni Sigfusson  ] , Mayor of [LOC Reykjanesbaer  ] , presented suggestions to the government on possible actions . 
He said that the suggestions had been well received by the ministers . 
`It will now become the project for this working group among others to develop these ideas further , ' said [PER Arni  ] . 
`Common sense will guide us and the belief that we can solve these problems . 
It began well in this meeting here today , but the work is far from over.' -- In an editorial in the March 18 Bladid ( centrist tabloid ) : " ( T ) here is a risk that people will lose sight of the task at hand and allow disputes over the past and unrealistic ideas about the future to dominate . 
There have been several examples of the latter , particularly the claim that [LOC Iceland  ] should look to the [ORG EU  ] in the area of security and defense . 
There is little time to spare , and it is unlikely that the [ORG EU  ] will have the capability or the interest in guaranteeing security or performing monitoring duties in the [LOC North Atlantic  ] . 
There is a job to be done , and it will require pragmatism , consultation , and businesslike work methods... . 
( I ) t is self-evident that [LOC Iceland  ] can also " look in other directions , " including [ORG NATO  ] and friendly neighboring countries with regard to national defense , rescue operations at sea , and monitoring territorial waters . 
[MISC Icelandic  ] political leaders' abilities and sense of responsibility will now be put to the test . 
" ------------------------ Keeping a Sense of Humor ------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
A poll in Frettabladid March 18 showed that 75 percent of Icelanders actually were not surprised by the [LOC U.S.  ] announcement that the base would close . 
Reflecting this national shrugging of the shoulders , Frettabladid carried a " diary entry " from well-known left-of-center [MISC Icelandic  ] film director , author , and commentator [PER Thrainn Bertelsson  ] March 18: " Heartbreak ! 
" In ( the film ) `Punktur , punktur , komma , strik' is my favorite sentence in [MISC Icelandic  ] films . 
A school class is interrupted by the tragic announcement that [LOC JFK  ] has passed away . 
Overcome by grief the teacher says , `What is to become of [PER Jackie  ] and the children ? 
' " Yesterday the third deputy Secretary of State was late for work one more time and was therefore tasked to call up [PER Geir Haarde  ] , who I am told is a very nice man and has recently returned from a reunion of the [MISC Haarde-family  ] in [LOC Norway...  ] anyway , the reason for the phone call was to ask Geir to let the [MISC Icelandic  ] people know that the [LOC U.S.  ] can't be bothered to keep running a very expensive base on `Midnesheidi' ( note: the heath on which the base is located ; end note ) , however bad the fishing or unemployment at [LOC Sudurnes  ] might be . 
" Isafold ( note: mythical female personification of [LOC Iceland  ] ; end note ) is left to her own demise . 
The fiance has left her . 
She gets to keep her engagement ring though , because they say the defense agreement is still being honored . 
What is to become of `the [LOC Mountain Woman'  ] and her children ? 
Sad news indeed that proves once again that loving someone who doesn't love you back is not a good idea . 
The blow is lessened , however , since the nation was well prepared to see its protector , which lost all interest in [LOC Iceland  ] years ago when the country stopped being a vital link in the [LOC U.S.  ] chain of defense , leave . 
" And although the whole nation knew this was about to happen there are always those that seem to be clueless . 
In this case , the only clueless individuals were these two: the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs .
