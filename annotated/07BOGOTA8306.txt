END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG GOC  ] Peace Commissioner [PER Luis Carlos Restrepo  ] told the Ambassador November 29 that the [ORG GOC  ] did not seek the problems with [PER Chavez  ] over a humanitarian accord , but that [PER Chavez  ] had forced the [ORG GOC  ] to act by repeatedly violating the rules set by President [PER Uribe  ] for [PER Chavez  ] , facilitation effort . 
[PER Chavez  ] had revealed confidential presidential conversations to the press , violated [LOC Colombia  ] 's " institutional hierarchy " by speaking directly to [MISC Colombian  ] Army Commander [PER Mario Montoya  ] , and tried to marginalize the [ORG GOC  ] by planning a meeting with a range of [MISC Colombian  ] political figures , such as former President [PER Ernesto Samper  ] , in [LOC Caracas.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Restrepo  ] said that the [LOC Caracas  ] meeting formed part of a plan by Senator [PER Piedad Cordoba  ] and [PER Chavez  ] to create a type of " alternative " or transitional [MISC Colombian  ] government . 
He acknowledged that the [ORG GOC  ] has paid a political cost for suspending [PER Chavez  ] , facilitation role , but said such a development was inevitable . 
[PER Restrepo  ] compared [PER Chavez  ] to the [ORG FARC  ] and other illegal armed group negotiators who constantly test the [ORG GOC  ] limits . 
If the [ORG GOC  ] had not pushed back , [PER Chavez  ] would have continued to assume a larger and large role . 
The [ORG GOC  ] ended [PER Chavez'  ] role now to avoid paying a higher political cost later. ------------------------------------- SHAPING DOMESTIC AND REGIONAL OPINION ------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Restrepo  ] said that the [ORG GOC  ] is trying to shape domestic and regional opinion to support its decision to suspend [PER Chavez'  ] facilitation effort . 
The [ORG GOC  ] has explained that [PER Chavez  ] and [PER Cordoba  ] had made little concrete progress , noting that other countries had taken steps to advance the process but that the [ORG FARC  ] had done nothing . 
Moreover , the breakdown of the process reflected the debate in [MISC Latin America  ] over two different models of democracy . 
[PER Chavez  ] favors an authoritarian , statist model while [PER Uribe  ] advocates a representational democracy rooted in civil liberties , open markets , and independent institutions. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) He said [PER Uribe  ] had reached out to other [MISC Latin leaders*including  ] [MISC Brazilian  ] President [PER Lula da Silva  ] , [MISC Costa Rican  ] President [PER Oscar Arias  ] , [MISC Peruvian  ] President [PER Alan Garcia  ] , [MISC Ecuadorian  ] President [PER Rafael Correa  ] , [MISC Uruguayan  ] President [PER Tabare Vazquez  ] , and [MISC Argentine  ] president-elect [PER Cristina Kirchner*to  ] explain his stance . 
At [PER Correa  ] 's urging , he will attend the ceremony inaugurating [LOC Ecuador  ] 's constituent assembly . 
None of the leaders had voiced a desire to become involved in the issue. ------------------------ MANAGING [ORG FRENCH CONCERNS  ] ------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Restrepo  ] said the [ORG GOC  ] recognizes that the [MISC French  ] are " obsessed " with obtaining the [ORG FARC  ] 's release of [MISC French-Colombian  ] dual national [PER Ingrid Betancourt  ] and that it needs to manage [MISC French  ] concerns in a constructive fashion . 
[MISC French  ] President [PER Sarkozy  ] had sent [PER Uribe  ] a letter on November 22-the day after the suspension announcement--urging him to extend [PER Chavez'  ] role until December 31 . 
[PER Uribe  ] had responded immediately on November 23 , publicly stating that the [ORG GOC  ] would welcome a unilateral [ORG FARC  ] hand-over of proof of life or of [PER Ingrid  ] to [PER Chavez  ] . 
[PER Restrepo  ] said the [ORG GOC  ] wants to keep the [MISC French  ] engaged with the [ORG GOC  ] on ways to obtain the hostages' release . 
Through the [MISC French  ] , the [ORG GOC  ] would also control the efforts of the [MISC Swiss  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] to achieve a humanitarian accord . 
Excluding the [MISC French  ] would only encourage them to pursue unilateral options. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Restrepo  ] said he spoke with [ORG French National Security Advisor Levitte  ] , whom he considers to be a pragmatic , credible interlocutor , on November 28 to discuss a possible [MISC Uribe-Sarkozy  ] phone call on November 29 . 
[PER Levitte  ] said [PER Uribe  ] 's decision to suspend [PER Chavez'  ] facilitation effort had surprised the [MISC French  ] , creating a perception of failure . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] considered himself a friend of [PER Uribe  ] and [LOC Colombia  ] , but faced substantial domestic pressure to produce results such as proof of life for [PER Ingrid  ] . 
The [ORG GOC  ] and GOF need to work together to obtain the hostages' freedom. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Restrepo  ] told [PER Levitte  ] the [ORG GOC  ] remains committed to obtaining the hostages' release . 
The [ORG GOC  ] has already stated that it would not stand in the way of unilateral [ORG FARC  ] actions leading to the hostages' release and has also voiced its willingness to extend legal benefits , such as suspended sentences or reduced jail time under the [ORG Justice  ] and Peace Law , to any [ORG FARC  ] front commanders or other leaders who free some hostages . 
Such benefits would apply to the release of any of the 45 hostages being considered under the humanitarian accord , as well as the hundreds of " economic " victims held by the group . 
[PER Restrepo  ] added that the [ORG GOC  ] remained interested in discussing a humanitarian accord with the [ORG FARC  ] , but that any future effort should be discreet with limited international facilitation. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Levitte  ] agreed to defer a [MISC Sarkozy-Uribe  ] call until the week of December 3 to give the [ORG GOC  ] time to develop possible mechanisms to obtain the hostages' release . 
[PER Restrepo  ] said he had also urged [PER Levitte  ] to serve as his contact on this issue , observing that it is important to reduce the role of the [MISC French  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] . 
[PER Restrepo  ] said [ORG Inter-American Development Bank  ] President and former [MISC Colombian  ] Ambassador to [PER Washington Luis Alberto Moreno  ] is in [LOC Paris  ] and would reach out to [PER Levitte  ] to brief him in greater detail on the reasons behind the [ORG GOC  ] 's decision to suspend [PER Chavez'  ] role. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Asked by the Ambassador if a joint [MISC French-USG  ] demarche would be useful , [PER Restrepo  ] said such a message would be harmful at this time . 
It would generate false expectations and put additional pressure on the [ORG GOC  ] . 
The [ORG GOC  ] believes it currently works well with the [MISC French  ] . 
[PER Restrepo  ] said that if he needs [MISC USG  ] help in dealing with the [MISC French  ] in the future , he will not hesitate to ask. --------------------------------------------- -------------- [ORG GOC  ] WOULD EMBRACE [ORG FARC  ] PROVISION OF PROOF OF LIFE TO CHAVEZ --------------------------------------------- -------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Restrepo  ] reiterated that if the [ORG FARC  ] provides proof of life to [PER Chavez  ] or [PER Cordoba  ] , the [ORG GOC  ] will publicly embrace such a move . 
( Note: On November 29 , [MISC Colombian  ] security forces detained three [ORG FARC  ] militia in [LOC Bogota  ] who possessed five video tapes , as well as letters , providing proof of life for sixteen [ORG FARC  ] hostages . 
These included [PER Ingrid Betancourt  ] and the three [LOC U.S.  ] citizens . 
) The Ambassador noted that if the [ORG FARC  ] gives [PER Chavez  ] proof of life , several [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Congressmen  ] might travel to [LOC Caracas  ] to meet with the [MISC Venezuelan  ] President . 
[PER Restrepo  ] cautioned that this would not be useful since it would inflate [PER Chavez'  ] importance and encourage him to seek a renewed role in a humanitarian accord .
