08 [ORG MAPUTO  ] 1098 Classified By: Charge d'Affaires [PER Todd C.Chapman  ] , Reasons 1.4 ( b+d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary: Large-scale narcotics shipments pass through [LOC Mozambique  ] , taking advantage of a vast and lightly guarded coastline . 
Money laundering may be increasing . 
Narcotraffickers in the country have connections to [LOC South Asia  ] , and some appear to have links to the ruling [ORG Frelimo  ] party and the [ORG GRM  ] . 
Using [ORG Department of State INL  ] funds , the [ORG Embassy  ] has led a successful border security program with the [MISC Portuguese  ] [ORG Embassy  ] that has resulted in the seizure of narcotics . 
The mission has also provided support via [ORG DoD  ] and [ORG Treasury  ] , and directed counternarcotic assessments by the [ORG Africa Command  ] , [ORG LegAtt  ] , and [ORG DEA  ] . 
While not a thoroughly-corrupted narco-state , the trends in [LOC Mozambique  ] suggest cause for concern unless the [ORG GRM  ] takes quick action to address these growing problems . 
End Summary. ------------------------------- [ORG Large Scale Narcotics Shipments  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In a series of investigative reports late last year , [LOC Mozambique  ] newsweekly [LOC Zambeze  ] claimed [LOC Mozambique  ] was considered by some estimates to be the second largest drug transit country in [LOC Africa  ] after [LOC Guinea-Bissau  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] Recent incidents suggest that larger amounts of narcotics are indeed passing through the country , taking advantage of a coastline twice the length of [LOC California  ] 's with minimal control . 
Long-time commentator on [LOC Mozambique  ] [PER Joseph Hanlon  ] publicly declared in May that the value of illicit drugs passing through the country probably surpasses combined legal external trade . 
In mid-May , police seized $5 million in heroin at the [LOC Ressano Garcia-Lebombo  ] border with [LOC South Africa  ] . 
In mid-June , police destroyed 7,000 liters of precursor chemicals discovered at the port of [LOC Maputo  ] from [LOC China  ] en route to [LOC South Africa  ] ; the [ORG United Nations Office of Drug Control  ] indicates that this port is heavily used to import chemicals used for meth production . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] have described to P/E chief how Pakistani-owned trucking companies based in [LOC Sofala  ] province over-declare imports at the [LOC Beira  ] port as one way to hide the quantities of drugs coming into the country . 
Early on June 20 , police discovered about one ton of hashish at [LOC Chongouene  ] beach in [LOC Gaza  ] province after receiving calls from local fishermen about suspicious vehicle movements in the area. ------------------------------------- Signs of Money Laundering Proliferate ------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) A source inside the [ORG Frelimo  ] party recently told the [ORG Embassy  ] that [LOC Mozambique  ] , with ten banks and thirty legally-registered exchange houses , has significantly more financial institutions than the market in such an impoverished country should be able to support with legitimate business . 
He also observed that 1500 construction projects are currently underway in Maputo--most financed with cash and mostly in real estate , and noted that it was unusual that housing prices in [LOC Maputo  ] are increasing in spite of the world financial crisis . 
Separately , [PER Hanlon  ] indicates that the rapid growth in [LOC Mozambique  ] 's stock market is suspect , as the value of stocks listed on the exchange is predicted to reach $100 million within two years of opening . 
Finally , lax regulation of casinos has raised concern by local radio and TV commentators about that sector 's role in money laundering. --------------------------- Criminal Ties to [LOC South Asia  ] --------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) A USAID report issued in 2006 notes that commerce in [LOC Maputo  ] depends on the financial acumen of a small number of [MISC Muslims  ] of [MISC South Asian-descent  ] who contribute generously to the [MISC FRELIMO  ] party . 
A major contributor to former President [PER Chissano  ] and President [PER Guebuza  ] from this community , who resides less than a hundred meters from the [ORG Presidential Compound  ] , [PER Mohamed Bashir Suleman  ] ( [ORG MBS  ] ) , is the owner of the [ORG MAPUTO  ] 00000713 002 OF 003 commercial [ORG MBS Group  ] . 
Contacts at all levels have advised Emboffs that [ORG MBS  ] is a known large-scale narco-trafficker . 
They indicate that [ORG MBS  ] uses his [MISC FRELIMO  ] party connections , as well as his shopping mall , supermarkets , and hotels to import narcotics and launder money without official scrutiny . 
Other [MISC South Asian  ] businessmen with ties to [MISC FRELIMO  ] also operate a vast network of loosely-regulated money changing houses , which reportedly maintain financial ties with more radical organizations in [LOC Pakistan  ] and elsewhere. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) A business contact recently shared with P/E chief a copy of a letter from [LOC Mozambique  ] 's [ORG Chamber of Business Associations  ] ( [ORG CTA  ] ) to the Prime Minister , expressing concern about one company selling imported vegetable oils at prices clearly below cost , noting that this type of price dumping could result in the withdrawal from the market of other companies and ultimately a monopoly to form . 
The contact said that the letter was in response to efforts by the [ORG MBS Group  ] to consolidate control of this sector--but in reality the message had nothing to do with vegetable oil--rather , it was a veiled warning from the business community to the government that [ORG MBS Group  ] 's use of vegetable oil to cover the import of illicit drugs was so brazen that it was no longer tolerable. ------------------------------------ Narcotrafficking Connections in [ORG GRM  ] ? ------------------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [ORG Frelimo  ] source also told the Charge that [ORG MBS Group  ] regularly uses phantom imports to launder money , and indicated that [ORG MBS  ] and another immigrant , [PER Ahmed Gassan  ] ( owner of the [ORG Home Center Furniture  ] store ) collude with the [ORG GRM  ] 's head of customs ( who he called " the King of Corruption " ) to reduce scrutiny on imports . 
The source also indicated that [PER Gassan  ] 's business interests are personally protected by Minister of Planning and Development [PER Aiuba Cuereneia.  ] --------------------------------------------- ---------- [ORG USG Border Security  ] , [ORG OTA  ] , [ORG DoD Support  ] , Other Assessments --------------------------------------------- ---------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Using [ORG Department of State INL  ] bureau funds , the [ORG Embassy  ] has a highly-successful joint project with the [ORG Embassy  ] of [LOC Portugal  ] to provide training for [ORG GRM  ] border guards . 
With a very small investment of less than $200,000 , this program has led to the seizure of $2.5 million in cash and the arrest of two [MISC Pakistani  ] smugglers ( ref B ) . 
While the program was denied funding in [LOC FY09  ] , it may receive support again in [LOC FY10  ] . 
[LOC Mozambique  ] 's [ORG Tax Authority  ] ( [ORG AT  ] ) has garnered a reputation for honesty and transparency , and the [LOC AT  ] 's director has publicly criticized the head of Customs about smuggling concerns . 
Via the [ORG Department of Treasury 's Office of Technical Assistance  ] , the [ORG USG  ] is providing training and capacity building to the [LOC AT  ] , and is reviewing ways to specifically support the [ORG AT  ] 's Financial Intelligence Unit . 
[ORG DoD  ] provided maritime training , small boats , and coastal monitoring systems to the [ORG FADM  ] and more of this type of support is programmed for the future . 
Finally , at the request of the [ORG Embassy  ] , [ORG Africa Command  ] , [ORG DEA  ] , [ORG Treasury  ] and LegAtt representatives visited [LOC Maputo  ] in early June to conduct a joint assessment of the drug trafficking problem and the [ORG GRM  ] 's capabilities . 
Initial findings validated the pervasiveness of the problem and identified the institutional weakness and level of corruption of [MISC Mozambican  ] law enforcement agencies as core problems inhibiting a coherent government response. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [LOC SBU  ] ) At the most recent mini-Dublin meeting chaired in late-May by the [MISC Portuguese  ] [ORG Embassy  ] , representatives from the [MISC Dutch  ] , [MISC British  ] and [MISC German  ] embassies specifically pointed out weaknesses in the [ORG GRM  ] 's enforcement activities , highlighting that concerns are widespread in the international community . 
These concerns were quickly borne out , as in a presentation at the meeting , a representative of the [ORG GRM  ] 's [ORG Inter-agency Working Group  ] on Narcotrafficking focused entirely on domestic consumption and addressing the health needs of local drug addicts. --------------------------------------------- ----------- Comment: Not Thoroughly-Corrupted , but [ORG Cause for Concern MAPUTO  ] 00000713 003 OF 003 --------------------------------------------- ----------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [LOC Mozambique  ] most certainly is not yet a thoroughly-corrupted narco-state . 
However , it is becoming increasingly clear that the magnitude of the drug shipments passing through [LOC Mozambique  ] may be on a much larger scale than previously understood , taking advantage of the country 's long and unprotected coast and the facility with which port and customs officials can be bribed . 
Money laundering , related government corruption ( possibly even official support ) , and ties to [LOC South Asia  ] mean that the problem has the potential to get much worse . 
While the mission has made initial steps to bring [ORG USG  ] resources to bear , the road ahead will require a comprehensive and coordinated effort by the international community to staunch the flow of drugs , not to mention strengthen the political will of the [ORG GRM  ] to take concrete action .
