( U ) Classified by Ambassador [PER Marcelle M. Wahba  ] for reasons 1.5 ( B ) and ( D ) . <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) MFA Minstate [PER Hamdan  ] bin [PER Zayid  ] contacted the Ambassador on June 2 to convey information about the [MISC UAEG’s  ] ongoing assistance to [LOC Jordan  ] and [LOC Morocco  ] . 
With regard to [LOC Jordan  ] , [PER Hamdan  ] reported that the [LOC UAE  ] has agreed to continue supporting [ORG Jordan’s  ] oil needs for the next three months . 
[PER Hamdan  ] indicated the level of support would continue to be the cash equivalent of 25,000 barrels per day . 
The [LOC UAE  ] began helping to fill [ORG Jordan’s  ] oil needs at the outbreak of hostilities with [LOC Iraq  ] in March . 
While the [MISC Jordanians  ] , in recent representations to the [LOC UAE  ] , asked for support to cover the next year , [PER Hamdan  ] advised that the [LOC UAE  ] , due to its own financial crunch , would only be able to provide assistance for the next three months. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Hamdan  ] also informed the Ambassador that , following the terror attacks in [LOC Casablanca  ] , the [ORG UAEG  ] provided $40 million in cash assistance to [LOC Morocco  ] . 
The [MISC Moroccans  ] intend to use the money to purchase much needed equipment . 
The [ORG Emiratis  ] have asked the [MISC Moroccans  ] to provide an accounting for the money spent . 
[PER Hamdan  ] confided that he had told his [MISC Kuwaiti  ] and [MISC Saudi  ] counterparts the [MISC UAE’s  ] donation was $80 million , in an effort to encourage them to give more . 
He wanted to make sure that the USG knew the real [LOC UAE  ] contribution , in the event that this is raised with us. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) COMMENT: [LOC Jordan  ] and [LOC Morocco  ] both enjoy extremely close ties to the [LOC UAE  ] . 
The [ORG Emiratis  ] have long felt it important to provide economic assistance and support to these two moderate [MISC Arab  ] states . 
The fact that [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] is offering cash assistance , vice assistance-in-kind , is a measure of just how close these ties are since the [ORG Emiratis  ] usually balk at writing checks . 
The [MISC UAE’s  ] strong official ties with [LOC Jordan  ] and [LOC Morocco  ] are bolstered by personal relationships between the ruling families . 
[MISC Jordanian  ] King [PER Abdullah II  ] is a close friend of [ORG UAE Armed Forces Chief  ] of Staff Muhammad bin [PER Zayid Al-Nahyan  ] ( MbZ ) . 
The two frequently hunt -- in [LOC Morocco  ] and [LOC Tanzania  ] -- joined , more often than not , by England’s Prince [PER Andrew  ] . 
The ties with the [MISC Moroccan  ] monarch are equally warm . 
[PER Shaykh Zayid  ] and other [LOC Emirati  ] ruling family members maintain vacation palaces in [LOC Morocco  ] and have poured money into assistance projects there . 
END COMMENT .
