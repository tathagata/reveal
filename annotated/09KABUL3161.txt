( [ORG S  ] ) Summary . 
The high point of the September 29 Border [MISC Flag Meeting  ] ( [ORG BFM  ] ) in [LOC Kandahar  ] was the [MISC Pakistani  ] delegation leader’s assertion that the [ORG Quetta Shura  ] is an unsubstantiated fabrication . 
This [ORG BFM  ] was the first at which the 5/2 [ORG Stryker Brigade  ] joined officials from [MISC Canadian  ] [ORG Task Force Kandahar  ] , the [MISC Afghan  ] Border Police , and the [MISC Pakistani  ] military . 
The [MISC Canadians  ] had a specific border cooperation agenda , the [MISC Afghans  ] were more interested in insurgent interdiction , and the [MISC Pakistani  ] side did not give either much importance . 
The next [ORG BFM  ] on November 17 will be one among several opportunities for the [LOC U.S.  ] to give [MISC AF-PAK  ] border issues in the [LOC South  ] -- especially reducing [ORG Taliban  ] sanctuary in [LOC Pakistan  ] -- the serious attention that they deserve . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The high point of the September 29 Border [MISC Flag Meeting  ] in [LOC Kandahar  ] was [MISC Pakistani  ] delegation leader [PER BG Sajjad’s  ] assertion that the [ORG Quetta Shura  ] is an unsubstantiated fabrication . 
When pressed , [PER Sejaad  ] expanded on his position , saying that the [MISC Americans  ] had fallen victim to rumors and adding that [MISC Pakistani  ] security authorities have more than 80 patrols and checkpoints in [LOC Quetta  ] every day and every night , and if there were any [ORG Taliban  ] leaders around they would know about them . 
In a similar vein , he insisted that [ORG Taliban  ] infiltration into [LOC Afghanistan  ] from [LOC Pakistan  ] was negligible , and that the group should be more concerned about terrorists and narcotics moving in the other direction . 
Recent press reporting on [LOC U.S.  ] concerns about the [ORG Taliban  ] presence in [LOC Baluchistan  ] did not figure directly in the meeting. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) This [ORG BFM  ] was the first in several months , and the first at which [LOC U.S.  ] representatives from the 5/2 [ORG Stryker Brigade  ] , including the commander , joined officials from [MISC Canadian  ] [ORG Task Force Kandahar  ] , the [MISC Afghan  ] Border Police , and the [MISC Pakistani  ] military . 
TFK Commander [PER BG Jonathan Vance  ] chaired the meeting , and the dynamics between the [MISC Afghan  ] and [MISC Pakistani  ] sides were so poor it was apparent that the session would have degenerated into acrimony without his multiple diplomatic interventions . 
The [MISC Canadian  ] presentation was intended to advance border cooperation and associated projects based on the [ORG Dubai Process  ] , covering the new [ORG Joint Border Coordination Center  ] in [LOC Spin Boldak  ] , progress with truck surveillance equipment , satellite phones , and construction of a new border facilities at the [MISC Weiche  ] crossing to begin in 2010 ( maybe ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [MISC Afghan  ] Border Police 3rd Zone Deputy Commander [PER Col. Sharif  ] was more interested in insurgent interdiction , and credited Blackwater training for the detailed list of seizures that included , among other things , 20 radios , 450 meters of wire , 800 detonators , and 62 prisoners . 
When [PER Col. Sharif  ] suggested that combined [MISC AF-PAK  ] border operations would be the best way to demonstrate true willingness to cooperate , [PER BG Vance  ] reminded the group that policy was to focus on communications and confidence building measures through the [LOC JBCC.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [MISC Pakistanis  ] essentially rebutted each [MISC Canadian  ] point with a complaint or counter-point: 1 ) the [ORG Iridium  ] phones were useless for cross-border communications , because the system was always busy ; 2 ) they would not send any personnel for training on the [MISC Canadian-supplied  ] truck surveillance equipment until they received a timeline of when the equipment would be operational ; 3 ) it did not make sense to begin construction on a new border crossing facility when the [MISC Afghans  ] kept the current [LOC Friendship Gate  ] locked , and all traffic had to go around the side ; and 4 ) the would make no commitment when [MISC Pakistani  ] officers would actually arrive to man the [ORG JBCC  ] . 
For their presentation , the [MISC Pakistanis  ] displayed a map slide with 171 border stations between the southern edge of the [LOC FATA  ] and [LOC Iran  ] to demonstrate the excellent control they maintain on their side , along with another listing nine [MISC ISAF  ] aircraft border incursions in the past two months with exact duration and meters of penetration , for which they demanded an accounting. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The participants agreed in principle that the next [ORG BFM  ] would take place on November 17 in [LOC Chaman  ] on the [MISC Pakistani  ] side . 
The agenda is to include an update on the [ORG JBCC  ] , a 5/2 [ORG Stryker  ] brief on their forces array near the , a TFK operations and intelligence brief on [LOC Kandahar  ] , and an accounting of [MISC ISAF  ] air incursions . 
Comment [LOC KABUL  ] 00003161 002.2 OF 002 <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The November 17 [ORG BFM  ] will be one among several opportunities for the [LOC U.S.  ] to give [MISC AF-PAK  ] border issues in the [LOC South  ] the serious attention that they deserve . 
Bio notes ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) There were eight [MISC Pakistanis  ] in the delegation , three regular army and five [ORG Frontier Corps Pishin Scouts  ] . 
[PER BG Sejaad  ] , who said he had been deputy zone commander for two months , gave the impression that he spoke with the authority of [LOC Islamabad  ] when discussing terrorists and the [ORG Taliban  ] . 
He also mentioned that he had attended [ORG NBC  ] training in [LOC Germany  ] prior to the first [LOC Pakistan  ] nuclear tests . 
[PER COL Shahzada  ] , a Pashtu-speaking brigade commander from [LOC Quetta  ] was the next most senior officer . 
The [MISC Canadians  ] said three ISI officers were among the [ORG Pishin Scouts  ] .
