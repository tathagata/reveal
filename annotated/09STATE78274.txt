[PER Verhagen  ] expressed satisfaction with the President’s invitation to PM [PER Balkenende  ] to attend the upcoming [MISC G20  ] summit in [LOC Pittsburgh  ] . 
They discussed next steps to establish an objective metric to assess [MISC Serbian  ] cooperation with the [ORG ICTY  ] , noting FM Verhagen’s continued skepticism that [LOC Serbia  ] was fully cooperating on investigations . 
EUR A/S [PER Gordon  ] thought feedback from teams implementing [LOC U.S.  ] assistance should provide a better idea of any gap between [MISC Serbian  ] promises and actions . 
FM [PER Verhagen  ] said he was closely and optimistically following progress toward a re-start of [LOC Middle East  ] peace talks and , less optimistically , events in [LOC Iran  ] , offering to help better align [MISC European  ] positions to support [LOC U.S.  ] efforts . 
END SUMMARY. ------------- [LOC Afghanistan  ] ------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The Secretary said she looked forward to continuing [MISC Dutch  ] advice about our strategic approach in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] strategy owed a lot to the 3-D approach ( defense , diplomacy , development ) that the [MISC Dutch  ] had pioneered . 
On the future level of [MISC Dutch  ] activities in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , FM [PER Verhagen  ] noted PM [PER Balkenende  ] had made clear in his morning meeting with President [PER Obama  ] that although there were differences within the [MISC Dutch  ] coalition government that were still being worked out , he was convinced the [MISC Dutch  ] would stay in some capacity in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and continue to build on their experience with the 3D approach . 
He viewed fighting corruption and supporting democratic elections as key elements of the current focus in [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) When the Secretary mentioned the [LOC U.S.  ] initiative to locate new cell phone towers on outposts that we control , [PER Verhagen  ] agreed to look into doing the same at [MISC Dutch  ] bases in the south . 
Up to then , the [MISC Taliban  ] had been very successful at making cell communication “go dark” at night , hampering the [LOC U.S.  ] ability to communicate . 
The Secretary also said that the successful cell phone tax should be applied to insurance needed to protect against damage and sabotage of cell phone towers . 
[PER Verhagen  ] highlighted a [MISC Dutch  ] initiative to expand the [MISC U.S.-built  ] airfield in [LOC Tarin Kowt  ] , the capital of [LOC Uruzgan  ] , noting that making it available for civilian use would make security investments more sustainable. ------ STATE 00078274 002 OF 003 <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The Secretary welcomed [MISC Dutch  ] participation in the [ORG G20 Pittsburgh Summit  ] , and noted , in particular , the credibility the [MISC Dutch  ] brought to development issues as a world leader in foreign development assistance . 
[PER Verhagen  ] said the [ORG GONL  ] welcomed the invitation to the [MISC G20  ] meeting. ------ [LOC Serbia  ] ------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The Secretary said the [LOC United States  ] understood [MISC Dutch  ] concerns about [MISC Serb  ] cooperation with the [ORG International Criminal Tribunal  ] for [LOC Yugoslavia  ] ( [ORG ICTY  ] ) and was looking for an objective metric to measure cooperation . 
[PER Verhagen  ] welcomed the [LOC U.S.  ] offer to share feedback from an [ORG FBI  ] fugitive recovery team dispatched to [LOC Belgrade  ] . 
[PER Verhagen  ] agreed the [MISC Serbs  ] had made progress , but remained concerned that they were not cooperating “to the maximum , ” according to the prosecutor’s recent report . 
He agreed that a more pro- [MISC European  ] government was unlikely , but the [ORG EU Stabilization and Association Agreement  ] ( [ORG SAA  ] ) could not be unblocked without full cooperation with the [ORG ICTY  ] , which provided for the extradition of [PER Ratko Mladic  ] to The [ORG Hague  ] . 
[PER Verhagen  ] expressed concern that the [MISC Serbs  ] might make promises and fail to deliver , and the [MISC Dutch  ] offers of assistance had not been accepted . 
Further , [MISC Dutch  ] proposals to look into other [ORG EU  ] sweeteners that fell short of implementing the [ORG SAA  ] had also been rejected. “Serbian leaders are only interested in an [ORG SAA  ] ; they say one thing in person , another to the international press , and another to their own publics , ” [PER Verhagen  ] said . 
A/S [PER Gordon  ] said the [ORG FBI  ] team would provide a better idea of what gap remained between [MISC Serbian  ] promises and actions. [ORG ---------------------- Development Assistance  ] ---------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Secretary also credited the [MISC Dutch  ] as a leading donor country . 
She asked [PER Verhagen  ] for his advice on establishing metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of international development activities . 
She added that as the [LOC United States  ] embarked on the [ORG Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review  ] ( [ORG QDDR  ] ) , she would be very interested in learning from the [MISC Dutch  ] experience. ------------------ [LOC Middle East Peace  ] ------------------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) FM [PER Verhagen  ] briefly raised his visit to [LOC Israel  ] three weeks earlier ; he had been closely following events , including the cancellation of Special Envoy Mitchell’s planned visit , President [PER Obama’s statement  ] , and Netanyahu’s response . 
[PER Verhagen  ] said that he was indeed convinced that we could reach a breakthrough and that all sides wanted a re-start , including [LOC Syria  ] , which he also had visited . 
However , a trigger was needed , which he suggested could be a moratorium on all settlement construction . 
The Secretary agreed that if the [MISC Israelis  ] agreed to any moratorium , however defined , it would be unprecedented and extraordinarily significant . 
The [MISC Palestinians  ] had moved against [ORG Hamas  ] and other militants , but the [MISC Arabs  ] had been slow to show they were also serious , she added. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Verhagen  ] said he was willing to be helpful to ensure the [ORG EU  ] moved with the [LOC United States  ] . 
He asked for [LOC U.S.  ] reaction to [PER Solana’s  ] proposed timeline , and the Secretary responded that , although [PER Solana’s  ] speech had been excellent , there really could be no timeline for [LOC Middle East  ] peace until negotiations resumed . 
She emphasized that the Quartet had been very helpful . 
[PER Verhagen  ] said he had asked [PER Solana  ] to set up an action plan for the [ORG EU  ] to help implement a peace agreement , once it had been achieved . 
He also noted the [MISC Dutch  ] were a main donor to the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] , assisting with prisons and security in [LOC Jenin  ] as well as a large agricultural project in [LOC Gaza  ] , for which the [MISC Dutch  ] had secured [MISC Israeli  ] agreement to keep the border open for STATE 00078274 003 OF 003 ----- [LOC Iran  ] ----- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) FM Verhagan expressed concern about [LOC Iran  ] and proposed discussions on what to do if the [ORG United Nations Security Council  ] proved unwilling to act . 
[LOC Europe  ] and the [LOC United States  ] should act together , but the [ORG EU  ] was not united . 
Any [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG EU  ] sanctions packages should be identical , in his view .
