[LOC MADRID  ] 2374 [LOC MADRID  ] 00002657 001.2 OF 003 Classified By: A/DCM [PER Kathleen Fitzpatrick  ] for Reasons 1.4 ( B ) and ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: In advance of the October 24 visit to [LOC Madrid  ] of [ORG US Attorney General  ] [PER Alberto Gonzalez  ] , [ORG Post  ] presents a brief update on several of the most important pending or recently completed terrorism or criminal cases in the [MISC Spanish  ] judicial system . 
[LOC Spain  ] has made great strides in disrupting terrorist cells and frustrating would-be terrorist plots and we remain pleased with [LOC Spain  ] 's counter-terrorism cooperation . 
However , its national prosecutors continue to have difficulty building cases that can stand up in the courts and recent [MISC Spanish  ] Supreme and national court decisions freeing alleged [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] suspects are an important factor to consider as we pursue improved judicial cooperation with [LOC Spain  ] . 
End Summary. ------------------------------- High-profile [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] Suspects ------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG National Court  ] on October 11 acquitted [PER Lahcen Ikassrien  ] after finding insufficient evidence that he was a member of either [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] or of the [PER Abu Dahdah  ] terror cell in [LOC Spain  ] , or that he fought alongside the [ORG Taliban  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Ikassrien  ] is a [MISC Moroccan  ] national and former [LOC Guantanamo  ] detainee transferred to [MISC Spanish  ] custody in July <a id='par2005' href='#par2005'>¶</a>2005 . 
The court refused to admit any prosecution evidence that was obtained during his detention in [LOC Guantanamo  ] or any information gleaned from intercepted phone calls in [LOC Spain  ] . 
[ORG Post  ] advised in [LOC Reftel  ] A that this might occur , due to the unfortunate similarities the [PER Ikassrien  ] case had with that of accused terrorist [PER Hamed Abderrahaman Ahmed  ] , known in the media as the " [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG Taliban  ] . 
" As reported in [LOC Reftel  ] A , the [MISC Spanish Supreme  ] Court announced on July 24 that it had annulled the six-year prison sentence handed down to [PER Abderrahaman  ] in September 2005 by [LOC Spain  ] 's national court . 
The court found that [MISC Spanish  ] prosecutors could not use any evidence collected during their interrogation of [PER Abderrahaman  ] while he was being held at [LOC Guantanamo  ] under conditions the court termed , " impossible to explain , much less justify . 
" The [MISC Spanish  ] prosecutor in the [PER Ikassrien  ] case had sought an eight-year jail sentence for the accused and tried unsuccessfully to build a case against [PER Ikassrien  ] that excluded evidence obtained in [LOC Guantanamo  ] , noting publicly that [MISC Spanish  ] authorities had obtained more than enough evidence of [PER Ikassrien  ] 's membership in the [PER Abu Dahdah  ] terror cell prior to his stay in [LOC Guantanamo  ] . 
It is unclear whether [PER Ikassrien  ] can be tried on any other terror-related charges. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In a separate case , [MISC Spanish  ] authorities on October 3 released [PER Taysir Alony  ] , who in September 2005 was sentenced to seven years in prison for membership in [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] , for humanitarian reasons stemming from a serious heart problem . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] is forcing [PER Alony  ] to wear a locator bracelet and monitoring his activities. ------------------------ [ORG CIA  ] Flights and Prisons ------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Despite President 's [PER Bush  ] recent announcement that there are no longer any terrorist suspects held in " secret prisons , " this issue continues to dominate press headlines in [LOC Spain  ] . 
On the front page of its October 15 edition , leading [MISC Spanish  ] daily [ORG El Pais  ] reported that the founder of [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] in [LOC Spain  ] has been in a " secret [ORG CIA  ] prison " for a year . 
Sensational headlines in the [MISC Spanish  ] press continue to claim that Syrian-born [MISC Spanish  ] national named [PER Mustafa Setmarian  ] was turned over to the [LOC US  ] by [LOC Pakistan  ] authorities at the end of <a id='par2005' href='#par2005'>¶</a>2005 . 
The press reporting claims that [PER Setmarian  ] sowed the seeds of [LOC Jihad  ] in [LOC Spain  ] during the 1980s , but that the [MISC Spanish  ] national court cannot request his extradition because he has not been officially arrested. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Along similar lines , and as we reported in REFTELS B and C , the [ORG CIA  ] flights inquiry remains a hot discussion topic in [LOC Spain  ] . 
On October 9 , [MISC German  ] national Khaled al-Masri testified for three hours in a [MISC Spanish  ] national court and claimed that he was kidnapped and tortured by [ORG CIA  ] officers during five months in 2004 . 
He said he was taken from [LOC Macedonia  ] to [LOC Kabul  ] on a flight that he believed could have stopped in [LOC Palma de Mallorca  ] . 
[PER Al-Masri  ] said he would not be able to identify any members of the crew on board the flight from [LOC Macedonia  ] , but he would be able to recognize some of those who interrogated him in [LOC Kabul  ] . 
As noted in [LOC Reftel  ] C , post continues to be concerned that Judge [PER Moreno  ] , the [LOC MADRID  ] 00002657 002.2 OF 003 [MISC Spanish  ] judge involved in this case , as part of [LOC Spain  ] 's highly independent judiciary , may determine that [MISC Spanish  ] law allows him to claim " universal jurisdiction " on cases involving alleged torture and abuse . 
Such a determination may provide him the authority to adjudicate events that transpired in a third country if it is proven that related events occurred in [LOC Spain  ] . 
[MISC Spanish  ] government officials , including President [PER Zapatero  ] , continue to maintain their firm public stance that the flights did not violate any [MISC Spanish  ] laws . 
However , Foreign Minister [PER Moratinos  ] expressed concern in front of the [ORG EU Parliament  ] last month that , " our territory could have been used not to commit any offense , but as a stop-over to commit them in other countries . 
" [PER Moratinos  ] has also urged the [ORG European Union  ] to more vigorously investigate the presence of secret [ORG CIA  ] prisons in other [MISC European  ] countries . 
[MISC Spanish  ] press reports that Judge [PER Moreno  ] in the near future will allow the national prosecutor to call other witnesses , including the airport authorities of [LOC Palma de Mallorca  ] and the aircraft handling services. ---------------------- [ORG Madrid Train Bombings  ] ---------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Despite the passage of more than two and a half years since the [LOC Madrid  ] train bombings occurred on March 11 , 2004 , and the near universal acceptance by the [MISC Spanish  ] public and terrorism experts that they were perpetrated by [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] sympathizers with the goal to punish [LOC Spain  ] for its participation in the [LOC Iraq  ] War , a segment of the opposition [ORG Popular Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) and the newspaper [ORG El Mundo  ] continue to allege a Socialist party conspiracy and cover up and claim that the [MISC Basque  ] terrorist group [ORG ETA  ] had some link with the March 11 attacks . 
The highly-charged political clash over the [LOC Madrid  ] bombing investigation has heightened the climate of bad blood between the opposition [ORG PP  ] and the ruling Socialist government and has greatly hindered the pace of the government 's prosecution of the attacks . 
[LOC Spain  ] is currently holding 29 individuals for their alleged connection to the bombings and prosecutors plan to charge these individuals with 191 counts of murder and 1,755 counts of attempted murder . 
The [ORG Spanish National Court  ] has recently rejected various appeals from the accused and said that the trials , scheduled to begin in February 2007 , may proceed . 
The [MISC National  ] court in late September asked the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] to send an extradition request to [LOC Italy  ] to bring [PER Rabei Osman  ] el-Sayed , known as " [PER Muhammad  ] the [MISC Egyptian  ] , " temporarily to [LOC Spain  ] to face trial in connection with the [LOC Madrid  ] bombings. ---------------------- The [ORG Detergent Command  ] ---------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In a separate case pending before [MISC Spanish  ] courts , the national prosecutor will seek a total of 142 years in prison for six [MISC Islamists  ] arrested in January 2003 in [LOC Barcelona  ] and [LOC Girona  ] . 
These individuals are known in the press as " The [ORG Detergent Command  ] , " due to their possession of large quantities of detergents that police believe were to serve as ingredients for explosive devices . 
According to the prosecutor , these individuals were preparing a terrorist attack against a military base in the south of [LOC Spain  ] , which may have been the base at [LOC Rota  ] that the [LOC US  ] shares with the [MISC Spanish  ] navy and air force . 
The prosecutor will seek 32 years for [PER Muhammad Tahraoui  ] , alleged leader of the [ORG Detergent Command  ] , and 22 years each for his alleged accomplices , [PER Muhammad Amine BenaMoura  ] , [PER Ali Kaouka  ] , [PER Ismail Boudjelthia  ] , [PER Muhammad Nebbar  ] and [PER Sohuil Kouka.  ] --------------- The [ORG Couso Case  ] --------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Although not related to terrorism , the case of [PER Jose Couso--the  ] [MISC Spanish  ] television cameraman killed in [LOC Baghdad  ] in April 2003 during a firefight between [LOC US  ] forces and [ORG Saddam  ] 's army--may return to national prominence after a [MISC British  ] inquest earlier this month implicated [LOC US  ] soldiers in the death of a [MISC British  ] journalist in southern [LOC Iraq  ] in March 2003 . 
[ORG Couso  ] 's death sparked protests in a country that was vehemently against the [LOC Iraq  ] invasion and friends and relatives of [ORG Couso  ] have tried for years to bring a wrongful death case against the [LOC US  ] soldiers of the [ORG Third Infantry Division  ] involved in the firefight . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] national court in March 2006 claimed it had no jurisdiction and refused to hear the case , but [ORG Couso  ] supporters appealed to the [ORG Spanish Supreme Court  ] the following month and we are still awaiting the high court 's ruling . 
Although we have yet to see any [MISC Spanish  ] reaction to the findings of the [MISC British  ] [LOC MADRID  ] 00002657 003.2 OF 003 inquest , there is a possibility that [ORG Couso  ] 's family and their supporters will increase pressure on the [ORG Spanish Supreme Court  ] to allow charges to be brought against the [LOC US  ] soldiers. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Comment: [LOC Spain  ] is a serious and committed partner in our global war on terror and we remain pleased with the efforts of [MISC Spanish  ] law enforcement , intelligence and judicial organizations to combat the [MISC Islamic  ] extremist threat . 
However , [MISC Spanish  ] police , prosecutors , and magistrates building legal cases against disparate and amorphous terror cells are struggling to develop evidence sufficient enough to meet the high threshold set by the [MISC Spanish  ] courts . 
[LOC Spain  ] has a highly independent judiciary that carefully guards this independence ( a major achievement of the post-Franco era ) , and this is an important factor to consider as we pursue increased judicial cooperation with [LOC Spain  ] in terrorism cases . 
Nonetheless , some of the recent [ORG Supreme  ] and national court decisions can clearly be seen as a criticism of [LOC US  ] detainee policies in [LOC Guantanamo  ] that are highly unpopular among the [MISC Spanish  ] . 
Embassy [LOC Madrid  ] looks forward to using next week 's visit of Attorney General [PER Gonzalez  ] and his delegation to engage [MISC Spanish  ] government officials on a range of important legal and judicial issues to encourage them to take an even more active role in the fight against global terrorism .
