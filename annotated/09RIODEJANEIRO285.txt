This week 's subjects: CLEANING UP THE FAVELAS: ECONOMIC BENEFIT TRUMPS COSTS --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Since May 2009 , the [ORG Military Police of Rio  ] de [LOC Janeiro  ] have systematically established a presence in five of the most violent favelas ( shanty towns ) within the [LOC Rio  ] municipality . 
Encouraged by successful results thus far , the [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] State Government is considering occupying and maintaining a police presence in all 1,000 favelas within the city limits . 
According to data provided by the Secretary of Security , these operations would cost the state between 90 million to 340 million [PER BR  ] ( 48 million to 183 million USD ) . 
Yet such activities could increase the city 's Gross Domestic Product by 30 percent to 38 billion [PER BR  ] ( 21 billion USD ) through increased commerce and new jobs , according to analysts such as [PER Jose Luiz Alqueres  ] , president of the [ORG Commercial Association of Rio  ] and [ORG Light  ] . 
[ORG MILITIA  ] GROUPS MOVE TO THE NORTH OF [LOC RIO  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Militia groups , i.e. vigilante anti-narcotrafficker forces often associated with local political leaders and involved in racketeering and piracy , are rapidly moving from the west to the north area of the city ( [PER Baixada Fluminense  ] ) , according to a researcher from [ORG NGO Global Justice  ] , [PER Rafael Dias  ] . 
This migration is due to coordinated action between the [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] Governor , [PER Sergio Cabral  ] , and [ORG Rio Mayor  ] [PER Eduardo Paes  ] , to undermine militias' business activities . 
The plan consists of military police incursions into [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] 's most visible favelas and tighter enforcement over public transportation , especially unlicensed mini-vans , which serve as a multi-million dollar source of revenue for militias . 
INCREASED INVESTMENT IN [ORG RIO PORT AREA  ] , [LOC AND...  ] ------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) [ORG Petrobras  ] and the two [MISC Brazilian  ] steel companies , [PER Gerdau  ] and [ORG CSN  ] , signed an MOU on July 7 to increase investment in the port area of [LOC Baia de Sepetiba  ] in [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] state . 
The three companies expect to invest 3 billion USD in streamlining infrastructure projects . 
[ORG Petrobras  ] , [PER Gerdau  ] and [ORG CSN  ] had previously been developing the area separately , but will now work together with the goal of facilitating off shore pre-salt exploration and other initiatives. .. . 
INCREASED FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT ------------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) According to the [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] Federation of Industry , investment in the state of [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] will increase by 126.3 billion [PER BR  ] ( 68 billion USD ) , the majority of which will come from foreign investors . 
The Federation estimates such investment would create 360,000 new jobs throughout the state , which already accounts for 13 percent of the [MISC Brazilian  ] Gross Domestic Product . 
Analysts at the Federation argue that its forecasted increased investment could bring [LOC Rio  ] 's share of the national economy up to 20 percent . 
LACK OF SKILLED LABOR FOR [ORG PRE-SALT OIL DEVELOPMENT  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) According to the [ORG Mobilization Program  ] of the [ORG National Oil and Gas Industry  ] ( [ORG PROMINP  ] ) , an estimated 285,000 skilled laborers - from painters to civil engineers - are needed to construct and maintain facilities for exploration and production of pre-salt oil reserves over the next five years . 
According to the [ORG Ministry of Social Development  ] , this lack of skilled labor is a result of the poor curriculum in [MISC Brazilian  ] public schools . 
[LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] State is in the most need of skilled labor , with current estimates at 5,920 workers for next year alone . 
[ORG Petrobras  ] and the [ORG Ministry of Mines and Energy  ] are now offering free qualification courses in areas such as mechanics and engineering . 
RIO BIOFUELS CONFERENCE HAILS [MISC BRAZILIAN  ] ENERGY MATRIX --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 .

" The CEO of [ORG Petrobras  ] Biofuels pointed out that 80% of global energy consumption is produced from coal , petroleum and derivatives . 
In [LOC Brazil  ] , however , coal constitutes only 6.2 percent of the energy matrix , while renewable energy makes up 46 percent . 
In response to criticism that biofuels consumption leads to deforestation due to increased sugar cane and soy crops , a representative from the [ORG National Petroleum Regulatory Agency  ] ( [ORG ANP  ] ) argued that [LOC Brazil  ] uses less than 5 percent of its arable land to produce biofuels . 
He further stated the 19.6 billions of liters of ethanol consumed in [LOC Brazil  ] in 2008 prevented 37.6 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions .
