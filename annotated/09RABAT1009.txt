( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In a meeting on December 28 , [MISC Moroccan  ] MFA Chief of Staff [PER Nasser Bourita  ] told Charge and [MISC A/PolCouns  ] that [PER Dadis Camara  ] had wanted to leave [LOC Morocco  ] last week but that the [ORG GOM  ] decided to keep him here until the end of the month for continuing medical treatment . 
He added that [MISC Guinean  ] Minister of [ORG National Defense Sekouba Konate  ] is due to arrive about 20:30 [MISC GMT  ] on December 28 to visit [PER Dadis  ] , who is still the leader of [LOC Guinea  ] . 
[PER Bourita  ] suggested that [PER Konate  ] was not preparing to take over that role . 
[PER Konate  ] has wanted to see [PER Dadis  ] for some time , presumably to make his own assessment of [PER Dadis  ] , health . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] corroborates that a plane carrying [PER Konate  ] has left [ORG Conakry.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In explaining the [ORG GOM  ] 's desire to help find a peaceful solution to the problems in [LOC Guinea  ] , [PER Bourita  ] said [LOC Morocco  ] 's relations with [LOC Guinea  ] and other countries must be taken into consideration . 
It is not for [LOC Morocco  ] , he said , to turn [PER Dadis Camara  ] over to the [ORG ICC  ] . 
He added that were a [ORG Security Council  ] resolution forthcoming , it would put the [ORG GOM  ] in a difficult position but would , of course , be binding . 
[PER Bourita  ] asked rhetorically whether " out of [LOC Guinea  ] " meant " in [LOC Morocco  ] " or that [LOC Morocco  ] should help find a third-country location for [PER Dadis Camara  ] . 
[PER Bourita  ] stressed that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC France  ] should avoid any public request for [LOC Morocco  ] to keep [PER Dadis  ] . 
[PER Bourita  ] further urged that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC France  ] should maintain contact with Foreign Minister [PER Taieb Fassi Fihri  ] while the Minister is in [LOC Tripoli  ] , [LOC Libya  ] , for the [ORG Arab Maghreb Union Ministerial  ] , December 28 to 30. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Echoing comments made to [MISC A/PolCouns  ] several weeks ago by the MFA Director of [ORG African Affairs  ] , [PER Bourita  ] went on to say that it would be better to find a way to deal with [PER Dadis Camara  ] in [LOC Guinea  ] . 
He noted that [PER Dadis  ] still enjoyed considerable support in the country and stressed the need to keep [PER Dadis  ] calm and confident about his future . 
To do otherwise , he said , risked more violence and more bloodshed. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] declared that [ORG Dadis'  ] return to [LOC Guinea  ] would lead to significant problems . 
He said he learned from doctors attending to [PER Dadis  ] that he was doing quite well , and he confirmed that [PER Konate  ] was on his way to [LOC Rabat  ] to meet with the junta leader and perhaps return with him to [LOC Guinea  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he had contacted General [PER Mamadouba Toto Camara  ] in [LOC Conakry  ] and was told [MISC Dadis'  ] imminent return to [LOC Guinea  ] " was a lie . 
" RABAT 00001009 002.2 OF 002 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [MISC Comment: While  ] we understand both from [PER Bourita  ] and from [MISC French  ] Ambassador [PER Joubert  ] that [MISC French  ] President [PER Sarkozy  ] planned to discuss [LOC Guinea  ] with King [PER Mohammed VI  ] during their &family dinner8 on December 27 , there do not appear to have been any breakthroughs. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) We believe [PER Bourita  ] is sincere in expressing the [ORG GOM  ] 's desire to help [LOC Guinea  ] . 
However , with no legal or medical basis to keep [PER Dadis  ] here and without any country other than [LOC Libya  ] prepared to accept him on a legal or medical basis , [PER Bourita  ] 's suggestion that [PER Dadis  ] be dealt with in [LOC Guinea  ] may be the only viable option .
