SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED--PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY Ref: 08 [ORG Sao Paulo  ] 0423 SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In the event of a [ORG WTO  ] dispute over [LOC US  ] tariffs on ethanol imports from [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] 's largest association of sugar and ethanol producers ( [ORG UNICA  ] ) would likely be asked to pay for the litigation . 
Conversations with high-ranking [ORG UNICA  ] representatives show an organization ready for litigation , but hopeful for a negotiated settlement . 
[ORG Mission  ] is ready to support a strategy of engagement with [ORG UNICA  ] and Government of [LOC Brazil  ] interlocutors to forestall any possible [ORG WTO  ] action . 
END SUMMARY . 
[ORG UNICA  ] WANTS TO SETTLE --------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) During a reception for visiting Deputy Secretary of Energy , [PER Jeffrey Kupfer  ] on August 6 , Econoff discussed the potential for [ORG WTO  ] action over ethanol with [ORG UNICA  ] President [PER Marcos Jank  ] . 
[PER Jank  ] stated emphatically that a suit in the [ORG WTO  ] that resulted in an abolition of the tariff was in the interest of its constituents who stand to gain not only from exports to the [LOC US  ] , but also from rising prices in the domestic market ( reftel ) . 
However , [PER Jank  ] did state that he understands the political sensitivity of any [ORG WTO  ] dispute , and is seeking interlocutors in the [LOC US  ] with whom he can discuss these issues during a planned trip to the [LOC US  ] in October . 
While [PER Jank  ] knows this is a [ORG Congressional  ] mandate that goes to 2010 , he believes there are mechanisms for reducing the tariff from 54 to 45 cents per gallon that would match the reduction in the blender 's tax credit in the [LOC US  ] . 
He is also hopeful of negotiating a long-term strategy for removing the tariff that he could sell to his member companies instead of going straight to litigation in the [ORG WTO  ] . 
( NOTE: Not only did [ORG UNICA  ] pay for the [ORG WTO  ] case against the [ORG EU  ] sugar regime , but [PER Jank  ] is a well-known expert in these cases and did the economic analysis behind the cotton case and the sugar regime case while working at [LOC ICONE-Institute  ] for Commercial and [ORG International Relations Studies  ] . 
END NOTE . 
) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Director for Corporate Communications , [PER Adhemar Altieri  ] , similarly stated that while [ORG UNICA  ] stands prepared to seek formal redress at the [ORG WTO  ] , the organization is first seeking a negotiated settlement that would avoid disruptions in the domestic market and allow for producers in [LOC Brazil  ] to ramp up production to meet increased demand from the [LOC US  ] . 
While [ORG UNICA  ] seems to believe that they may receive pressure to file a suit at the [ORG WTO  ] , [PER Altieri  ] stated that a system of quotas or a graduated reduction in the tariff would be preferable to an immediate withdrawal of the tariff for the [MISC Brazilian  ] economy . 
When questioned whether the removal of the tariff could lead to [ORG GOB  ] export controls to maintain the domestic supply of ethanol , [PER Altieri  ] responded that [ORG UNICA  ] has approached Chief of Staff equivalent , [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] , regarding the very negative consequences of any export controls by the [ORG GOB  ] . 
( NOTE: [PER Altieri  ] did not indicate what [PER Rousseff  ] 's response had been . 
END NOTE . 
) COMMENT ------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Domestic industry will have to decide how hard to advocate for taking the ethanol tariff to the [ORG WTO  ] . 
While the [ORG GOB  ] may wish to lay down a marker that it is ready to consider a case in the wake of the stalled [LOC Doha  ] process , there is little chance for a case to go forward if the industry is not firmly supportive . 
[PER Jank  ] genuinely understands the political repercussions of taking on a new [LOC US  ] administration as it comes into office as well as the potential impact this case could have in our bilateral efforts on biofuels through our [ORG MOU  ] . 
[PER Jank  ] and [ORG UNICA  ] have been active players in the biofuels [ORG MOU  ] process and will likely participate in the upcoming private sector advisory committee meeting being convened by conference call August 20 , as part of [PER U/S Reuben Jeffery  ] 's visit to [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[ORG SAO PAULO  ] 00000443 002 OF 002 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Mission  ] suggests we engage proactively with [PER Jank  ] and support him in meeting with a series of relevant [LOC US  ] interlocutors during his next visit to the [LOC United States  ] in October . 
Considering that the industry would be required to pay for any [ORG WTO  ] case , proactive discussions with [PER Jank  ] could forestall the industry 's support for this litigation . 
These meetings could include , for example , key interlocutors at USTR and other USG agencies as well as in [ORG Congress  ] .
