STATE 8403 <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
2009 [LOC BERLIN  ] 1528 <a id='parC' href='#parC'>¶</a>C . 
2009 [LOC BERLIN  ] 1377 <a id='parD' href='#parD'>¶</a>D . 
2009 [LOC BERLIN  ] 1167 Classified By: [PER Robert A. Pollard  ] , Minister-Counselor for [MISC Economic Affai  ] rs , for Reasons 1.4 ( b , d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) This is an action request. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Embassy [LOC Berlin  ] strongly recommends that the [ORG Washington Terrorist Finance Tracking Program  ] ( [ORG TFTP  ] ) and data privacy experts currently scheduled to visit [LOC Brussels  ] next week also visit [LOC Berlin  ] to discuss [ORG TFTP  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] data privacy policy with [MISC German  ] officials . 
[LOC Germany  ] is critical to the debate on data protection issues within the [ORG EU  ] and we need to engage [MISC German  ] government interlocutors , parliamentarians and opinion makers . 
The exaggerated data privacy views of the current minority governing partner , the [ORG Free Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG FDP  ] ) , have contributed to a domestic discussion that distorts [LOC U.S.  ] policy and is negatively-influencing the [MISC European  ] debate . 
Embassy believes we will be most successful if we address [MISC German  ] data privacy concerns in a comprehensive way , including various information sharing programs such as HSPD-6 , [ORG TFTP  ] , and Passenger Name [MISC Records.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [LOC Germany  ] has become a difficult partner with regards to security-related information sharing initiatives following the September 27 national elections , which brought the [ORG FDP  ] into the governing coalition . 
The [ORG FDP  ] sees themselves as defenders of citizens' privacy rights and these views have led the [ORG FDP  ] to oppose many of [LOC Germany  ] 's post-9/11 counterterrorism legislative proposals ( see reftels ) . 
At times , the [ORG FDP  ] 's fixation on data privacy and protection issues looks to have come at the expense of the party forming responsible views on counterterrorism policy. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Over the past months , Ambassador [PER Murphy  ] , the [ORG DCM  ] , and other embassy staff have engaged [MISC German  ] government interlocutors , influential parliamentarians and law enforcement officials to stress the importance of security-related information sharing initiatives such as [ORG TFTP  ] . 
However , in these meetings , our [MISC German  ] counterparts consistently raise concerns about [LOC U.S.  ] data protection measures and policy . 
Furthermore , the [MISC German  ] views often distort and misrepresent [LOC U.S.  ] policy . 
For example , current Federal Justice Minister [PER Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger  ] ( [ORG FDP  ] ) - who has considerable influence - is particularly outspoken and does not appear to have ( or perhaps want ) an informed view of USG data privacy practices . 
It is critical that we aggressively and vocally counter these misrepresentations of [LOC U.S.  ] policy. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Embassy staff raised the prospect of an inter-agency experts group visiting [LOC Berlin  ] with xxxxx. xxxxx who is a strong supporter of close [MISC U.S.-German  ] counterterrorism cooperation and information sharing , welcomed the proposal and believed that skeptics of [LOC U.S.  ] policy in other ministries and [ORG Bundestag  ] parliamentarians would benefit from a comprehensive and factual discussion of the details of [LOC U.S.  ] data protection policy. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In addition to our request that the [ORG Treasury  ] visitors to [LOC Brussels  ] add a [MISC Berlin-stop  ] , we strongly recommend that an inter-agency data privacy experts delegation visit [LOC Berlin  ] to discuss overall [LOC U.S.  ] data privacy policy with [MISC German  ] officials . 
The [ORG FDP  ] returned to power after a ten-year foray in the opposition and key leaders lack experience in the practical matters of tackling real-world security issues in the [MISC Internet  ] age . 
In our meetings we have made the point that countering terrorism in a globalized world , where terrorists and their supporters use open borders and information technology to quickly move people and financing , requires robust international data sharing . 
We need to also [LOC BERLIN  ] 00000128 002 of 002 demonstrate that the [LOC U.S.  ] has strong data privacy measures in place so that robust data sharing comes with robust data protections .
