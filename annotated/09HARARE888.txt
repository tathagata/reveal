Warthogs [PER Delay Ambassador’s Arrival..  ] . 
This week we are thrilled to welcome Ambassador [PER Charles A. Ray  ] to Post . 
He arrived on November 4 after his November 3 arrival was delayed because of a bizarre accident hours earlier . 
On takeoff to [LOC Bulawayo  ] on the afternoon of November 3 , an [ORG Air Zimbabwe  ] flight struck a group of about five warthogs and veered off the runway , destroying some of the runway lights . 
Passengers on the [ORG Air Zim  ] flight were stuck in the plane for about two hours ; security authorities forced passengers to surrender any photographic evidence of the crash before they were allowed to leave . 
All night flights on November 3 , including Ambassador Ray’s [MISC South African  ] Airways flight from [LOC Johannesburg  ] , were cancelled . 
The government did not comment on the warthogs’ fate .

Prisons Conditions Remain Dire.. . 
Despite some dramatic improvements in food availability in prisons , conditions remain dire , particularly for women and juveniles . 
A [ORG Red Cross  ] feeding program has reduced malnutrition in prisons , but some local [ORG NGOs  ] continue to contend that prison conditions are far from acceptable . 
Although the government has allowed greater access to prisons than in years past , the prison system remains cloaked in secrecy .

All Quiet on the Banking Front.. . 
A week has gone by since the press reported that the central bank had been spending the reserve deposits of the commercial banks . 
But so far , there have been no bank runs , and the bankers themselves seem not to be bothered by the news . 
Either they know something we don’t , or they’ve become accustomed to life down the rabbit hole. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
Time for Another Indigenization Scare.. . 
A ZANU-PF minister has been promoting a plan to give the GOZ authority to seize majority ownership of foreign-owned firms . 
[LOC Saviour Kasukuwere  ] , Minister of Indigenization and Empowerment , recently met with bU [ k ] isxQQtation rules would only apply to new companies . 
As long as the [ORG MDC  ] is in the government , Kasukuwere’s proposed regulations will not be introduced . 
But even talk of implementing the Act is enough to make businesspeople nervous , and the inevitable headlines in the foreign press will be another reminder to the world that it is too early to invest in [LOC Zimbabwe.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
Salary and Wage Negotiations Deadlocked.. . 
According to the [ORG Employers’ Confederation of Zimbabwe  ] ( [ORG EMCOZ  ] ) , most companies have failed to agree on salary and wage increases with their employees . 
[ORG EMCOZ  ] told us that at a recent meeting held two weeks ago , employee representatives from the [ORG Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions  ] proposed a minimum wage equivalent to 60 percent of the USD 500/month poverty line . 
[ORG EMCOZ  ] says employers are unable to meet such high wage demands . 
Instead , they propose to negotiate annual adjustments rather than the current quarterly adjustments in exchange for monthly salary increases based on productivity gains. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
Sweet Deal for [ORG Sable Chemicals..  ] . 
Having closed their electrolysis factory a month ago due to high electricity tariffs , Zimbabwe’s sole fertilizer manufacturer , [ORG Sable Chemicals  ] , has re-opened its plant . 
According to the general manager , [ORG Sable Chemicals  ] eventually managed to strike a deal with the [ORG Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority  ] for a lower tariff of US 3 cents per kilowatt hour instead of the normal US 7 cents paid by the other consumers . 
The development is set to improve the availability of fertilizers on the market. ----------------- Quote of the Week ----------------- “The countries of [LOC Europe  ] and [LOC America  ] want to dictate which way our politics should go and they talk about regime change . 
They want us to go down on our knees and beg . 
One day we should think about fighting them in the international courts.” -- President [PER Robert Mugabe  ] , speaking at a funeral at [LOC Heroes Acre  ] on Q-- President [PER Robert Mugabe  ] , speaking at a funeral at [LOC Heroes Acre  ] on October 31 .
