( C ) Summary and [ORG Action Request  ] . 
With [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  ] 's November 23 visit approaching , President [PER Lula  ] has not adopted a position on the [ORG IAEA  ] ( [ORG P5  ] 1 ) [LOC Geneva  ] proposal or the [LOC Iran  ] nuclear program as a whole , although [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] or [ORG Itamaraty  ] ) senior officials praised the [ORG P5  ] 1 proposal and assured that [LOC Brazil  ] would quietly support sanctions against [LOC Iran  ] in the [ORG UN  ] if [MISC IAEA-based  ] talks fall through . 
[LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] are expected to sign several bilateral agreements during the visit , including an agreement to waive visa requirements for holders of diplomatic passports traveling on orders . 
Senior officials in [ORG MRE  ] and the President 's office say that [PER Lula  ] will discuss human rights issues with [LOC Iran  ] , largely becuse of pressure from [MISC Brazilian  ] civil society , but is only prepared to talk about the nuclear issue in general terms . 
[ORG MRE  ] acknowledged worries that [PER Lula  ] and his advisors will be publicly seen as overly friendly to [LOC Iran  ] during the visit . 
[PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's visit will follow closely on the heels of visits by [MISC Israeli  ] President [PER Shimon Peres  ] ( Nov. 11 ) and [MISC Palestinian  ] President [PER Mahmoud Abbas  ] ( Nov. 14 ) . 
Under Secretary for Political Affairs [PER Vera Machado  ] explained to the Charge d'Affaires on October 28 that [PER Lula  ] believes , based on his previous conversations with President [PER Obama  ] , that his communication with [LOC Iran  ] and the [LOC Middle East  ] will be appreciated by the [ORG USG  ] and western governments . 
[PER Lula  ] and his inner circle of advisors do not appear to fully grasp the negative feedback that will be created by the [LOC Iran  ] visit , nor the potential policy complexities involved with hosting so many regional leaders at once . 
[ORG Action Request: As Brazil  ] makes clear that it will continue to pursue a more active role in the [LOC Middle East  ] , [ORG Mission  ] renews its request for a [LOC Washington  ] regional expert to meet with senior counterpart officials about [LOC Iran  ] and broader [LOC Middle East  ] issues . 
End Summary and [ORG Action Request  ] . 
[LOC Brazil  ] and the [ORG IAEA Proposal  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In his October 27 and subsequent meetings with poloff , [ORG MRE Iran/Central Asia Desk  ] Director [PER Roberto Luis Pires Ribeiro  ] da [PER Silva  ] praised the multilateral approach of the [ORG IAEA  ] proposal made to [LOC Iran  ] in [LOC Geneva  ] , particularly the roles of [LOC Russia  ] to enrich [LOC Iran  ] 's low-enriched uranium ( [ORG LEU  ] ) fuel and of [LOC France  ] to convert the [ORG LEU  ] to fuel plates . 
He said that the inclusion of these two countries , rather than the details of the proposal itself , were noticed by President [PER Lula  ] and his advisors . 
[PER Pires  ] said no decision has been taken by the GOB at the executive level to endorse the [ORG P5  ] 1 [ORG IAEA  ] proposal , even though the regional and science/technology desks at [ORG Itamaraty  ] have recommended official support . 
He believed that [LOC Iran  ] would " half-accept " the proposal originally but would eventually agree to make a one-time transfer of 1200 kg of [ORG LEU  ] . 
( Other senior officials at [ORG MRE  ] were less optimistic . 
) [PER Pires  ] emphasized , as in previous meetings ( ref A ) , that if talks fell through and sanctions against [LOC Iran  ] were proposed at the [ORG UN  ] level , [LOC Brazil  ] would vote in favor -- but would be quiet about it . 
In a November 4 meeting , [ORG Presidential Foreign Policy  ] Adviser [PER Marcel Biato  ] told the Charge d'Affaires that [PER Lula  ] would bring up nuclear issues with [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , recommending dialogue with western governments and reaching an [MISC IAEA-based  ] solution , but has not committed to discussing [ORG P5  ] 1 proposal specifics . 
[PER Ahmadinejad Visit:  ] End of Visas for [MISC Iranians  ] ? --------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [ORG MRE Central Asia/Iran  ] division is busy preparing for [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's November 23 visit . 
[PER Pires  ] said that the official agenda includes signing a series of pre-negotiated bilateral agreements , including an expected ( but not yet finalized ) agreement to waive bilateral visa requirements for bearers of diplomatic passports traveling on orders . 
In [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001300 002.3 OF 003 early November conversations , [PER Pires  ] and other [ORG MRE  ] officials categorized as false October 27 [MISC Brazilian  ] media reports that asserted , based on an interview with [MISC Iranian  ] Deputy Foreign Minister [PER Alireza Salari  ] , that [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] would reach an agreement to liberalize bilateral visa rules for all passports , giving [LOC Iran  ] in effect visa waiver status to [LOC Brazil  ] . 
According to [PER Pires  ] , there has been and will be no attempt to adjust visa access for normal or official passports . 
Other bilateral accords to be signed include a general economic assistance agreement , a more detailed agricultural assistance agreement outlining exchange of [MISC Iranian  ] petrochemical inputs and fertilizers for [MISC Brazilian  ] technology , and several memorandum of understanding , most notably one between each nation 's central bank . 
He characterized the agreements as " government to government , " including nothing specific to [ORG Petrobras  ] or other [MISC Brazilian  ] companies that could fall under the [ORG Iran Sanctions Act  ] . 
Internal Pressure ----------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Both [PER Pires  ] and [ORG MRE Middle  ] East I ( including [LOC Israel  ] , [LOC Lebanon  ] , and [LOC Syria  ] ) [ORG Desk  ] Director [PER Claudio Cesar Nascimento  ] , who spoke briefly with poloff on October 28 , noted that [ORG Itamaraty  ] and [PER Lula  ] were getting pressured on a near-daily basis by [MISC Brazilian  ] religious and ethnic minority groups opposed to the [MISC Iranian  ] government 's activities . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's [MISC Jewish  ] community has employed their senior members within the President 's party ( [ORG PT  ] ) to advise [PER Lula  ] and his advisors against hosting [PER Ahmadinejad  ] . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] Baha'i community has also been very active and Syrian-Lebanese [MISC Christians  ] have registered concerns on a more ad hoc basis . 
In response to public pressure , [PER Pires  ] said , [PER Lula  ] plans to press [PER Ahmadinejad  ] about release and treatment of [LOC Iran  ] 's domestic religious and political detainees -- including those arrested in the post-election demonstrations this summer . 
[PER Pires  ] nevertheless expressed concern [ORG Presidential Foreign Policy Advisor Marco  ] [PER Aurelio Garcia  ] ( who is especially close to [PER Lula  ] ) would change the vanilla talking points and remarks being prepared by [ORG Itamaraty  ] , setting the stage for the President to downplay human rights concerns in the meeting or to make public comments about [LOC Iran  ] and [PER Ahmadinejad  ] that could be misconstrued . 
He suggested that [PER Garcia  ] had already done this prior to [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's aborted visit in May ( ref E ) . 
[PER Lula  ] 's Justification -------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) As November 23 approaches , several local media outlets have published articles critical of the planned [PER Ahmadinejad  ] visit , posing essentially the same question raised by the [ORG USG  ] and much of the international community: Why is [PER Lula  ] insisting on cultivating relations with [LOC Iran  ] ? 
In an October 28 meeting with the Charge d'Affaires , MRE Under Secretary [PER Vera Machado  ] provided insight into [PER Lula  ] 's thinking . 
[PER Machado  ] said that , during a brief discussion on [LOC Iran  ] between [PER Lula  ] and President [PER Obama  ] at the July [ORG G8 Summit  ] in [LOC L'Aquila  ] , at which she was present , President [PER Obama  ] responded to [PER Lula  ] 's comments about wanting to meet with [LOC Iran  ] by saying he would appreciate anything [PER Lula  ] could do to be helpful . 
[PER Lula  ] has interpreted this to mean that the [ORG USG  ] tacitly supports [LOC Brazil  ] 's efforts to engage [LOC Iran  ] ( and the broader [LOC Middle East  ] ) on key issues . 
According to [PER Machado  ] and other [ORG MRE  ] officials , [PER Lula  ] has been most interested in raising issues such as detainee releases , human rights , and general questions . 
She confirmed that there is no indication that [PER Lula  ] is interested in discussing with [PER Ahmadinejad  ] the specifics of the [ORG IAEA Geneva  ] proposal or [LOC Iran  ] 's activities in neighboring countries . 
Handling all the Visitors ------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Handling agendas will be a delicate matter for [LOC Brazil  ] , given the competing needs of its visitors this month , which include [MISC Israeli  ] President [PER Shimon Peres  ] ( Nov. 11 ) , [MISC Palestinian  ] President [PER Mahmoud Abbas  ] ( Nov. 14 or 15 ) , and likely a rescheduled visit by [MISC Lebanese  ] President [PER Michel Sleiman  ] after [PER Ahmadinejad  ] . 
According to [ORG MRE  ] and the [MISC Israeli  ] Deputy Chief of Mission , the [PER Peres  ] visit will feature signing of several bilateral economic accords similar to those to be signed during the [PER Ahmadinejad  ] visit . 
The [MISC Israeli  ] Embassy is also pushing the [ORG Senate  ] and [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] leadership for the opportunity to allow [PER Peres  ] to address both houses of [ORG Congress  ] . 
Senior congressional staff told poloff that [ORG Chamber President  ] [PER Michel Temer  ] and other key leaders were [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001300 003.3 OF 003 amenable to the idea and had received a green light ( if not an endorsement ) for the idea from the President [PER Lula  ] 's office . 
It now appears that [ORG Congress  ] will not grant the request due to concerns that [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , in particular , would have to be given the same forum ( which [ORG MRE  ] reports he has not asked for ) . 
[ORG Itamaraty  ] had not been aware of the [MISC Israeli  ] Embassy 's request to [ORG Congress  ] until early this week and has since sent signals that it would prefer that no visiting foreign leaders be given the podium in [ORG Congress  ] . 
Comment and Action Request -------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Despite growing contacts and a small number of experts on the [LOC Middle East  ] in [ORG Itamaraty  ] , the [ORG GOB  ] as a whole still does not fully grasp the regional and multilateral dynamics surrounding [LOC Iran  ] and the [LOC Middle East  ] , and its frenzied effort to reach out to all players in the region is increasing the potential for missteps and misunderstandings . 
We believe the [ORG GOB  ] is misreading the views and actions of the [LOC United States  ] and other key players on these issues , even as [LOC Brazil  ] wades purposefully deeper into the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
The upcoming visits of [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , [PER Peres  ] , [PER Shimon  ] , and [PER Sleiman  ] , combined with a likely January 2010 trip by President [PER Lula  ] to the region , are likely to compound , rather than alleviate , these problems , as [LOC Brazil  ] seeks to burnish its image as the country that can talk to all sides . 
Additional [ORG USG  ] engagement , perhaps in concert with [LOC Britain  ] , [LOC France  ] , and other key international players , will be needed to press our point of view and inform [LOC Brazil  ] 's . 
Mission renews its request ( ref B ) for a [LOC Washington Middle East  ] expert visit to [LOC Brasilia  ] to address senior-level counterparts in the President 's office and [ORG Itamaraty  ] to present our views .
