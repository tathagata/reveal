( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Summary:  ] The [ORG Landless Rural Worker 's Movement  ] ( [ORG MST  ] ) follows a pre-planned methodology in its land seizures that includes leveraging contacts within the [ORG GOB  ] 's [ORG National Institute of Colonization and Agricultural Reform  ] ( [ORG INCRA  ] ) to help select targets , according to [ORG MST  ] expert [PER Clifford Welch  ] , a [LOC U.S.  ] professor based in [LOC Presidente Prudente  ] , an interior city in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] State . 
A visit by [PER EconOff  ] to this region provided a snapshot of the mechanics of how the [ORG MST  ] has operated in this area . 
Once [ORG MST  ] members occupy the land , the organization negotiates with the police and the [ORG GOB  ] to convert the land into a permanent [ORG MST  ] settlement . 
The [ORG MST  ] then distributes plots of land to their followers . 
In a practice , both cynical and ironic , [ORG MST  ] members sometimes wind up renting to agribusinesses the very lands they seized . 
The demographic profile of [ORG MST  ] members shows them to be primarily small families and retired couples . 
Non-MST locals would prefer their [ORG MST  ] neighbors leave , fearful that [ORG MST  ] tactics will scare off foreign investment . 
End summary. --------------------------- An [PER Up-Close View  ] of the MST--------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On April 7 , [PER EconOff  ] met with [ORG Landless Rural Workers Movement  ] ( [ORG MST  ] ) expert Professor [PER Clifford Welch  ] , from the [ORG State University of Sao Paulo  ] ( [ORG UNESTE  ] ) in [LOC Presidente Prudente  ] ( a regional city in the interior of [LOC Sao Paulo State  ] , pop . 
230,000 ) and on loan from the [ORG University of Michigan  ] . 
[PER Welch  ] has been teaching about the [ORG MST  ] movement for the last three years at the [ORG UNESTE  ] agrarian reform center called [ORG NERA  ] . 
His students compile information on [ORG MST  ] , usually by closely monitoring newspaper articles , and they also directly interact with the movement 's members and visit their camps . 
[PER Welch  ] himself has spent extensive time in [ORG MST  ] camps and has a good understanding of the organization . 
He has a decidedly pro-MST view , calling the movement , " The Fight for Land . 
" [PER EconOff  ] got [PER Welch  ] 's view of how the [ORG MST  ] operates in that area while on a visit to [LOC Presidente Prudente.  ] ------------------------------ The [ORG MST Method: Work the State  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG MST  ] uses its contacts inside the federal agency [ORG INCRA  ] ( [ORG National Institute of Colonization and Agricultural Reform  ] ) to determine which land is next up for expropriation , [PER Welch  ] said . 
This agency is charged with designating private land for government seizure , usually by deeming it " unproductive . 
" [PER Welch  ] told [PER EconOff  ] that [ORG INCRA  ] does not make this information publically available and that the only way [ORG MST  ] could access it would be through informants inside [ORG INCRA  ] . 
( Note: There is at least one public case of a retired [ORG INCRA  ] employee , [PER Ivan Carlos Bueno  ] , later joining [ORG MST  ] . 
End note . 
) Once [ORG MST  ] chooses its land target from [ORG INCRA  ] 's list , it then gives [ORG INCRA  ] a deadline to expropriate the land--usually five days--or else [ORG MST  ] threatens to expropriate it for them. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG INCRA  ] normally cannot expropriate land with such a short deadline , so [ORG MST  ] invades the land as promised . 
They follow up by constructing what they call a camp , essentially a makeshift settlement . 
The police usually arrive shortly after and begin negotiations for the squatters to leave . 
[ORG MST  ] supporters , overmatched by armed police , evacuate the camp , wait for the police leave , and then return . 
This process repeats , sometimes indefinitely. ----------------------------- Life inside an [ORG MST Settlement  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) A legal [ORG MST  ] settlement is formed on parcels of land that [ORG INCRA  ] has officially expropriated and then opened for public use . 
[ORG MST  ] settlers live on many of them , but not all . 
Once on the land , [ORG MST  ] farmers usually produce beef , dairy products , castor oil , or coffee . 
They sell their crops on the open market . 
Anyone who owns a parcel of land has complete control over it and does not share it with other settlement workers . 
Some farmers even choose to rent the land to agribusiness . 
A local agribusiness leader who has rented from [ORG MST  ] " landowners " told [PER EconOff  ] that many of the settlers are remarkably good businesspeople. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) It takes approximately five years for a new [ORG MST  ] recruit to earn a piece of land . 
He or she performs menial tasks for the community while waiting . 
As new workers join the movement and this wait time grows , the pressure to find more settlements grows with it . 
A 10 percent tax ( the [ORG MST  ] prefer to call it a tithe ) from the farmers supports these laborers while they wait for their parcel of land. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG NERA  ] has determined that invasions directly resulted in legalization of 80 percent of the [ORG MST  ] 's settlements . 
[PER Welch  ] would not speculate on what would have happened if the movement had tried to take that same land with peaceful action . 
He did indicate that [ORG MST  ] uses [ORG NERA  ] 's study to justify its continued invasions . 
[ORG INCRA  ] uses the judicial process to expropriate peacefully the remaining 20 percent of settlements. --------------------------- The [ORG MST Participant Profile  ] --------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) According to [PER Welch  ] , the driving force behind agrarian reform is the desire to move out of poverty . 
The principal demographic of those who join the movement are retired couples in their 40s and 50s , many of whom are former sugarcane laborers . 
[PER Welch  ] told [PER EconOff  ] that [MISC Brazilian  ] law entitles these sugarcane cutters to a pension after 20 years of work , leaving many of them to early retirement . 
Since a large portion of these workers has always wanted their own parcel of land , they join the [ORG MST  ] . 
( Note: While the [ORG GOB  ] officially counts [ORG MST  ] family size at five per person , [PER Welch  ] estimates a number close to three , due to this demographic and his experience in the camps . 
This means [ORG MST  ] membership self-estimates of 1.5 million people are at least 40 percent too high . 
End note . 
) --------------------- Public Support Waning --------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Conversations with citizens in the city of [LOC Presidente Prudente  ] in the interior of [LOC Sao Paulo State  ] indicated that few people in the community support the [ORG MST  ] . 
The president of the President [PER Prudente chapter  ] of the [LOC Sao Paulo Federation  ] of Businesses ( [ORG FIESP  ] ) told [PER Econoff  ] that fears of land seizures had pushed the real estate price for the fertile land down to one-third of what similar land costs in non-MST threatened areas in [LOC Sao Paulo State  ] . 
[ORG FIESP  ] board members agreed , citing the movement 's decline as a principal reason that local land value had just recently begun to rise . 
[LOC Presidente Prudente  ] 's vice-mayor and city manager both echoed [ORG FIESP  ] 's sentiments. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Comment:  ] The [ORG MST  ] 's practice of distributing fertile parcels of land to the faithful and the subsequent ability for these individuals to rent the land back to agribusiness is ironic , to say the least . 
President [PER Lula  ] has been conspicuously silent on his early-career promises to support the [ORG MST  ] for a good reason: An organization that seizes land in the name of the landless and then rents it back to the very same sorts of people from whom they took it has a serious credibility problem .
