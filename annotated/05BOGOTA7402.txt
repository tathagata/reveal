( U ) Participants: [LOC U.S.  ] --- <a id='parR' href='#parR'>¶</a>R . 
[PER Nicholas Burns  ] , U/S for Political Affairs Ambassador [PER William B. Wood Cynthia Echeverria  ] , [ORG P Special Assistant Jeffrey DeLaurentis  ] , [ORG Polcouns  ] ( notetaker ) [PER Luis Guio  ] , Interpreter [LOC Colombia  ] -------- [PER Alvaro Uribe Velez  ] , President [PER Camilo Ospina  ] , Minister of [ORG Defense Acting Foreign Minister  ] [PER Camilo Reyes Presidential Communications Director Jaime Bermudez Francisco Gonzalez  ] , [ORG MFA  ] ( notetaker ) ------- Summary ------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) During a warm , productive and candid meeting , [PER U/S Burns  ] told President [PER Uribe  ] that President [PER Bush  ] would deliver a message of strong , continued support in Crawford on August 4 , in particular regarding [ORG GOC  ] counter-narcotics and counter-terrorism efforts . 
At the same time , noting differing views among some members of [ORG Congress  ] , [PER Burns  ] pressed for more progress on several long-standing human rights cases , including on [LOC San Jose  ] de [LOC Apartado  ] and [LOC Mapiripan  ] , to strengthen the human rights certification , and urged [PER Uribe  ] to rigorously and energetically implement the new justice and peace law . 
He cautioned that , unless addressed , these negative perceptions could affect ongoing [LOC U.S.  ] support for [LOC Colombia  ] . 
He called on the President to make a public , renewed commitment to expeditiously adjudicate the human rights cases in question , and to do everything under his executive powers to accelerate progress . 
He also urged the [ORG GOC  ] to respond to concerns that the justice and peace law impededextraditions . 
He encouraged [PER Uribe  ] to visit [LOC Washington  ] en route to the [ORG UNGA  ] to make his case directly to the [ORG Congress  ] on both issues . 
[PER Uribe  ] assured [PER U/S Burns  ] that his government remained committed to protecting human rights and that implementation of the new law would be accelerated and rigorous . 
He had already urged the Prosecutor General to make a public statement on [ORG GOC  ] efforts to complete its investigation on [LOC San Jose  ] de [LOC Apartado  ] . 
On counter-narcotics efforts , [PER Uribe  ] said he was looking for new ways to encourage families to abandon growing illicit drugs and engage them in crop substitution programs . 
[PER Burns  ] encouraged newly-appointed Minister of [ORG Defense Ospina  ] to also visit [LOC Washington  ] soon for discussions at [LOC DOD  ] and State . 
[PER Ospina  ] quipped that he was Secretary [PER Rumsfeld  ] 's deputy in [LOC Colombia  ] , " coordinating his SIPDIS third front of the war on terrorism . 
" [PER Burns  ] thanked [PER Uribe  ] for [ORG GOC  ] efforts to secure the release of the three [LOC U.S.  ] hostages . 
While acknowledging that the [MISC French  ] had launched a new campaign to pressure him to negotiate the release of Colombian-French hostage [PER Ingrid Bentancourt  ] , [PER Uribe  ] was emphatic that he would make no deal that did not include the three [MISC Americans  ] . 
On [LOC Venezuela  ] , [PER Uribe  ] was particularly candid . 
He called [PER Chavez  ] a mix of someone with imperial sentiments and drunk with socialism . 
He said [PER Chavez  ] has dreams of an hemispheric television station and a unified oil company , and was looking to create a new coalition to confront the [LOC U.S.  ] He urged the [LOC U.S.  ] to reach out to those in the hemisphere [PER Chavez  ] believes are his friends . 
[PER Uribe  ] , in resignation , lamented that , given [PER Chavez  ] 's efforts to create a " new socialism , " his total domination over [MISC Venezuelan  ] institutions , the lack of opposition and checks and balances , and the prospects of hyper-inflation , political unrest was probably inevitable . 
End Summary. --------------------------------------------- --------------- [ORG IDB  ] and [MISC Colombian  ] Ambassador to the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Luis Alberto Moreno  ] --------------------------------------------- --------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Uribe  ] arrived a few minutes late , explaining that he had just finished a telephone call with the president of [LOC Guyana  ] , lobbying for Ambassador [PER Moreno  ] 's candidacy for president of the [ORG IDB  ] . 
The election was the following day and [PER Moreno  ] needed one more country to secure a win in the first round of voting . 
[PER Uribe  ] was convinced that if voting went into a second round , [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] would form a coalition on behalf of the [MISC Brazilian  ] candidate . 
[PER U/S Burns  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] was fully behind [PER Moreno  ] and had lobbied extensively as well ( reftel ) . 
[PER Uribe  ] stressed that he would do a terrific job at the [ORG IBD  ] but it would be extremely difficult to find a suitable replacement for him as ambassador to the [LOC U.S.  ] In the middle of the meeting , [PER Uribe  ] took a call from his counterpart from [LOC Ecuador  ] who pledged to support [PER Moreno  ] . 
President [PER Palacio  ] told [PER Uribe  ] that [PER Chavez  ] had called him earlier in the day asking [LOC Ecuador  ] to support the [MISC Brazilian  ] candidate. ------------------------- [LOC U.S.  ] Support for [LOC Colombia  ] ------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Uribe  ] expressed appreciation for U/S Burn 's visit as well as for ongoing support from the [LOC U.S.  ] , including the [ORG Congress  ] and theembassy . 
" With the difficulties we face on a daily basis , [LOC U.S.  ] assistance has been critical and I have no words to express my gratitude . 
" U/S [PER Burns  ] underscored that the [ORG GOC  ] had made tremendous progress fighting drugs and terrorism under [PER Uribe  ] 's leadership , and [LOC U.S.  ] support would continue as a result . 
[PER Uribe  ] acknowledged that the numbers of kidnappings , homicides , and drugs eradicated or seized remained high in absolute terms , but the numbers were decreasing in relative terms and the trend lines were good . 
That said , while the reduction in coca production was positive , he wanted to make an even greater effort in 2005 to achieve an even steeper decline . 
We are winning the war , he said , but have not won yet and need to stay the course . 
The Ambassador noted that 100,000 hectares of cocaine had been sprayed in 2005 so far , putting us 25 percent ahead of last year when total hectares sprayed reached 135,000 . 
[PER U/S Burns  ] noted that the [MISC Afghans  ] in comparison had destroyed only 216 and a half hectares thus far . 
Our aim is to destroy drugs , said [PER Uribe  ] , and the [ORG GOC  ] was also ready to provide [LOC Afghanistan  ] technical assistance and experience. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Uribe  ] reviewed [ORG GOC  ] strategy for fighting narcotraffickers . 
This included using aerial and manual eradication , extradition , and crop substitution ( i.e. alternative development initiatives ) . 
The [ORG GOC  ] had the political will to make adjustments to be even more effective . 
For instance , this year [ORG GOC  ] officials had accelerated manual eradication to complement aerial efforts . 
So far , they had eradicated 11,000 hectares with prospects to achieve 30,000 hectares by the end of the year. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Uribe  ] said he wanted to reward communities who assisted military and police forces discover illicit drug storage facilities hidden in the jungle . 
He was also looking at ways to encourage families to abandon growing illicit drugs and engage them in a program of crop substitution . 
( [PER Note: Uribe  ] reportedly made ad hoc comments during a town hall discussion last weekend in the department of [LOC Meta  ] that the [ORG GOC  ] would buy illegal crops of coca directly from farmers in exchange for a promise from them to never grow coca again . 
This has met with criticism from the [MISC Colombian  ] [ORG Congress  ] and presidential candidates . 
[ORG GOC  ] officials subsequently clarified [PER Uribe  ] 's remarks by saying the [ORG GOC  ] would pay for information from farmers about the production and storage of cocaine . 
) [PER Uribe  ] understood the idea was controversial but believed it could provide results . 
The Ambassador responded that a reward for information that helped locate and seize drugs was a solid proposal but purchasing drugs from growers was another matter . 
The [ORG UN  ] was already prepared to publicly criticize the idea . 
He told [PER Uribe  ] the [ORG USG  ] would think about innovative ways to encourage small farmers to abandon growing illicit drugs and come back with some proposals . 
Perhaps a credible non-governmental organization could help . 
[PER U/S Burns  ] said he would also alert the President and Secretary that this was on [PER Uribe  ] 's mind. --------------------------------------------- ---------- August 4 Meeting at [LOC Crawford/Split View  ] from [LOC Washington  ] --------------------------------------------- ---------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER U/S Burns  ] said the President was looking forward to the meeting in [PER Crawford  ] and he had come to [LOC Colombia  ] , in part , to discuss how to ensure a positive result . 
[PER Uribe  ] would hear a message of strong , continued support from President [PER Bush  ] , in particular regarding [ORG GOC  ] counter-narcotic and counter-terrorism efforts . 
[PER Uribe  ] repeated that he wanted even better results. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Burns  ] noted that the view was different from some on [LOC Capitol Hill  ] and in the human rights community . 
Concern over the lack of progress on several prominent , longstanding human rights cases , coupled with a perception that the new Law on Justice and Peace governing [ORG AUC  ] demobilizations was too lenient , was raising questions about [ORG GOC  ] commitment to improving human rights in the country . 
[PER Burns  ] cautioned that these negative perceptions in the [ORG Congress  ] could affect ongoing [LOC U.S.  ] support for the successor to [LOC Plan Colombia  ] . 
He suggested [PER Uribe  ] arrive in [PER Crawford  ] with a sense of his strategy over the next five to six years for [LOC Plan Colombia  ] follow on . 
Beyond the concerns on human rights and the law , the budget for foreign assistance would be leaner in coming years . 
Multi-year commitments would not be possible . 
The case for ongoing support at similar levels would have to be made annually. -------------------------------------- Concern about Progress on [ORG Human Rights  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Burns  ] reiterated the concern of some that the [ORG GOC  ] was not acting quickly and concretely enough in adjudicating outstanding human rights cases , in particular regarding [LOC Mapiripan  ] , now seven years old , [LOC Arauca  ] , and the February massacre in [LOC San Jose  ] de [LOC Apartado  ] . 
He recommended [PER Uribe  ] authorize a public statement that the [ORG GOC  ] would make a renewed effort to act quickly in successfully bringing these cases to conclusion . 
While recognizing that several were being adjudicated in the courts , [PER Burns  ] also urged [PER Uribe  ] do everything under his executive powers and discretion to accelerate progress . 
The Secretary still had to certify to [ORG Congress  ] on the human rights situation and had already delayed it in the hopes further progress could be reported . 
Without a credible certification , there was a danger that some members of [ORG Congress  ] would attach additional restrictions to future aid to [LOC Colombia  ] . 
The [ORG Department needed  ] " to see in your statements and actions a renewed determination and commitment to address these cases , " he said. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Uribe  ] said he understood the situation . 
He was confident the new Fiscal ( Prosecutor General ) would do everything he could to accelerate the ongoing investigations . 
He had already asked the outgoing Fiscal to make a public statement in the next few days on the status of the [ORG GOC  ] investigation on [LOC San Jose  ] de [LOC Apartado  ] . 
He also defended his [ORG Administration  ] 's record , noting that the number of such incidents had been dramatically reduced under his presidency and that the [ORG GOC  ] response had been thoroughly transparent . 
He again committed to call the Prosecutor General to ensure a statement on [LOC San Jose  ] de [LOC Apartado  ] was released before [ORG Crawford. ------------------------- Law for Justice and Peace  ] ------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Uribe  ] told the [PER U/S  ] that he had met with [MISC Spanish  ] judge [PER Balthazar Garzon  ] and other leaders for three hours during his recent visit in [LOC Spain  ] to discuss the law . 
[PER Garzon  ] had said the law was too lenient because there was no balance between the gravity of the crime and the length of the sentence . 
[PER Uribe  ] agreed but told [PER Garzon  ] it was the price of a peace process . 
It had to be compared to previous demobilization laws in [LOC Colombia  ] which had no justice component , and laws dealing with other peace processes around the world . 
For the first time , the [ORG GOC  ] secured approval of a law for peace with justice , he insisted . 
There was no pardon for atrocities ; the concept of justice and reparations was on the books in [LOC Colombia  ] for the first time . 
[PER Uribe  ] also insisted that the law would apply to all illegal armed groups who wanted to demobilize . 
He stressed that many complained the law was too tough for the guerrillas and too weak for the paramilitaries . 
The guerrillas continued to insist they would accept only amnesty and no jail time . 
In his view , the law struck a balance equally applicable to all illegal armed groups . 
At the same time , he acknowledged that compromises had to be made . 
The investigatory scheme set out in the law was satisfactory to get to the truth , but in a country which used to average over 30,000 assassinations a year , to investigate everything was an unrealistic dream. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER U/S Burns  ] said he had met with human rights [ORG NGOs  ] earlier in the day . 
Many were critical of the law and believed it endorsed impunity . 
He had responded that the [LOC U.S.  ] supported the law , and was convinced it would be effective with rigorous and energetic implementation . 
The [ORG GOC  ] had to ensure the law was aggressively applied . 
[PER Uribe  ] agreed and per [LOC U.S.  ] suggestions , would demand that the law 's implementation be accelerated and rigorous . 
He had already communicated this to Peace Commissioner [PER Luis Carlos Restrepo  ] . 
Ambassador also suggested that , as the [ORG GOC  ] defines the process , it make its decisions public . 
The [ORG GOC  ] had to be pro-active in explaining how it intended to implement the law . 
Critics were filling the void while the [ORG GOC  ] remained silent . 
For example , a local [ORG NGO  ] told [PER U/S Burns  ] there would be no meaningful investigation under the law . 
You can answer this , said the Ambassador . 
[PER U/S Burns  ] also encouraged [PER Uribe  ] to come to [LOC Washington  ] on his way to the [ORG UNGA  ] in mid-September to make his case to the [ORG Congress  ] . 
[PER Uribe  ] agreed. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER U/S Burns  ] said the impact on extraditions was another concern on the law . 
It would be useful for the [ORG GOC  ] to respond to [ORG NGO  ] assertions that law impeded extraditions . 
[PER Uribe  ] insisted that it did not/not impede extraditions and the [ORG GOC  ] would continue extraditing criminals to the [LOC U.S.  ] He acknowledged , however , that there would be some instances when he would delay extraditions , in particular for paramilitary " ringleaders , " as a lever for their future behavior . 
[PER U/S Burns  ] insisted that the [LOC U.S.  ] wanted to see anyone who violated [LOC U.S.  ] law or harmed [LOC U.S.  ] citizens remain subject to extradition. ----------------------- MOD Visit to [LOC Washington  ] ----------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER U/S Burns  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] was ready to discuss enhanced mil-to-mil relations when [ORG GOC  ] officials were ready . 
He encouraged newly-appointed Minister of Defense [PER Camilo Ospina  ] to visit [LOC Washington  ] soon for discussions at [LOC DoD  ] and State . 
[LOC Ospina  ] readily agreed and [PER Burns  ] said he would take back [LOC Ospina  ] 's interest to Secretary [PER Rumsfeld  ] . 
( Note: In a subsequent conversation with the Ambassador , [LOC Ospina  ] said [LOC Colombia  ] wants the deepest possible defense relationship , but that there continued to be a dispute within the government as to timing . 
In general , the [ORG GOC  ] is of the view that nothing important should happen before the [ORG Constitutional Court  ] on re-election , mid- to late-September . 
President [PER Uribe  ] and [LOC Ospina  ] expect to have their thinking sorted out before the meeting with President [PER Bush  ] in [PER Crawford  ] . 
) --------------------------------- [LOC U.S.  ] Hostages/Humanitarian Accord --------------------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [PER U/S Burns  ] thanked President [PER Uribe  ] for ongoing [ORG GOC  ] efforts to secure the release of the three [LOC U.S.  ] hostages held by the [ORG FARC  ] for over two years . 
Anything more the [ORG GOC  ] could do would be greatly appreciated . 
[PER Burns  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] would continue to rely on the [ORG GOC  ] 's guidance and wisdom and was prepared to help in any way . 
[PER Uribe  ] responded that the [ORG GOC  ] continued to work closely with the [ORG Embassy  ] . 
If there were any military operation the [LOC U.S.  ] believed should be undertaken to secure the hostages' release , his forces would " stand shoulder to shoulder with the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" in carrying it out. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [PER Uribe  ] said he was scheduled to meet the mother of Colombian-French hostage [PER Ingrid Betancourt  ] later in the day . 
[MISC French  ] Prime Minister [PER Dominique De Villepan  ] was pushing him hard to negotiate [PER Betancourt  ] 's release as part of a humanitarian exchange . 
He stated emphatically that he would not go forward with any deal that did not include the three [MISC Americans  ] . 
[PER Uribe  ] stressed that he would refuse any exchange that included GOC-held [ORG FARC  ] members guilty of crimes under the [MISC Colombian  ] [ORG Constitution  ] . 
He would also insist that [ORG FARC  ] prisoners released as part of an humanitarian exchange be immediately deported to [LOC France  ] with [ORG GOF  ] guarantees that they did not return to [LOC Colombia  ] and re-join [ORG FARC  ] ranks . 
[PER Uribe  ] promised to keep Ambassador [PER Wood  ] apprised of all details on any negotiations that could affect the [LOC U.S.  ] hostages . 
He also predicted that the [ORG FARC  ] would be more inclined to negotiate seriously now for such an exchange if the [ORG Constitutional Court  ] approved presidential re-election . 
However , the [ORG FARC  ] would wait until a new government was in place if re-election was shot down by the court. --------- [LOC Venezuela  ] --------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [PER U/S Burns  ] told [PER Uribe  ] that the Secretary appreciated hearing his views on how to handle [PER Chavez  ] during her April visit . 
She was determined not to make [PER Chavez  ] into something bigger by responding to every jab . 
President [PER Bush  ] was also focused on [LOC Venezuela  ] and looked forward to a discussion at [PER Crawford  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] had no ministerial contact with the [ORG GOV  ] at this point and welcomed [PER Uribe  ] 's insights. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( S ) [PER Uribe  ] noted that [PER Chavez  ] had been quieter in the last two months and had , for example , agreed to extradite [ORG FARC  ] leader [LOC Chiguiro  ] to [LOC Colombia  ] without a formal [ORG GOC  ] request . 
Nonetheless , he did not trust [PER Chavez  ] . 
He never talked to him alone ; he always brought along Foreign Minister [PER Barco  ] or some other witness . 
On [ORG GOV  ] links to the [ORG FARC  ] , [PER Uribe  ] said [PER Chavez  ] has told him that he does not protect the guerrillas but could not deny that some in his political organization supported them . 
[PER Uribe  ] complained that [PER Chavez  ] had little opposition now . 
There was no balance of power within the government . 
All decisions were ultimately made by him . 
[PER Uribe  ] stressed that [PER Chavez  ] had an effective stump speech: he claims to be distributing the country 's oil wealth through subsidies to the populace while previous governments stole it . 
This was a powerful message and hard to contradict . 
[PER Uribe  ] also expressed surprise that the [MISC Venezuelan  ] business community was not more jittery , given [PER Chavez  ] 's efforts to create a " new socialism . 
" The [MISC Venezuelan  ] economy could also move into hyper-inflation , he predicted . 
Already , inflation had increased to 17-20% , compared to 5% in [LOC Colombia.  ] <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( S ) According to [PER Uribe  ] , [PER Chavez  ] was a mix of someone with imperial sentiments , drunk with socialism . 
He believed that [PER Chavez  ] , with presumed support from President [PER Lula  ] , hoped to create a new coalition to confront the [LOC U.S.  ] He has may dreams , said [PER Uribe  ] , including a hemispheric television station ( [ORG Telesur  ] ) and the unification of oil companies on the continent into a regional " petrosur . 
" He encouraged the [LOC U.S.  ] to improve relations with [LOC Uruguay  ] and others in the region [PER Chavez  ] believed were his supporters. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( S ) Finally , [PER Uribe  ] said he was becoming more and more resigned to the notion that , given the current situation in [LOC Venezuela  ] , political unrest was inevitable .
