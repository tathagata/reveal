[ORG NATO  ] and the [LOC High North  ] --------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [MISC Icelandic  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] representatives met June 16 in [LOC Reykjavik  ] for annual working-level [ORG Security Dialogue  ] talks . 
In her opening remarks , Ministry for [ORG Foreign Affairs Political  ] Director [PER Greta Gunnarsdottir  ] , the [ORG Icelandic Delegation Head  ] , said [LOC Iceland  ] wanted to ensure that the security agenda between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Iceland  ] stayed robust , and noted that the meeting 's planned discussion was a good reflection of this effort . 
Turning to [ORG NATO  ] issues and [LOC High North  ] policy , the first agenda item , [PER Gunnarsdottir  ] said [LOC Iceland  ] was very pleased with the [ORG Strasbourg-Kehl Summit  ] and its success in reaffirming the strength of the [ORG Alliance  ] . 
She said the decision to revisit the [ORG Strategic Concept  ] was a key outcome for [LOC Iceland  ] . 
[PER DAS Garber  ] agreed , noting several additional important results from the [LOC U.S.  ] perspective: Allies' endorsement of the new [LOC Afghanistan  ] strategy ; a reconfirmed sense of family and common values among the [ORG Alliance  ] ; the return of [LOC France  ] to the military command ; the accession of [LOC Albania  ] and [LOC Croatia  ] and the message that [ORG NATO  ] 's door remains open ; and the consensus built on a transatlantic approach to [LOC Russia  ] ahead of the upcoming [ORG NATO-Russia Council  ] meeting. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Looking specifically to the [LOC High North  ] , [ORG Foreign Affairs Advisor  ] to the [MISC Icelandic  ] Prime Minister Amb . 
[PER Sturla Sigurjonsson  ] said that [LOC Iceland  ] was pleased to see a new Secretary-General coming from the [MISC Nordics  ] . 
Though both the [MISC SecGen  ] and the new [ORG Strategic Concept  ] need to reflect the needs of all [ORG Alliance  ] members , it is important that the new document contain some language on the [LOC High North  ] as an area of interest to [ORG NATO  ] . 
[PER Gunnarsdottir  ] built on this assessment , reviewing recent [MISC Icelandic  ] Government efforts to draw attention to the region . 
Beginning with the [ORG NATO Seminar  ] on the [LOC High North  ] in [LOC Reykjavik  ] in January 2009 and a government report from April on [LOC Iceland  ] in the [MISC Arctic  ] , [LOC Iceland  ] has tried to highlight the policy challenges stemming from climate change and increased resource exploitation in the area . 
[LOC Iceland  ] still wants to see the [ORG Arctic Council  ] remain the primary venue for [MISC Arctic  ] issues , but [ORG NATO  ] must also play a role . 
[PER Gunnarsdottir  ] also asked about plans for [LOC U.S.  ] ratification of the [ORG UN Convention  ] on the Law of the [LOC Sea  ] ( [ORG UNCLOS  ] ) , which [LOC Iceland  ] considers very important. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER DAS Garber  ] commented that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Icelandic  ] approaches to the [LOC High North  ] are very much in line with each other . 
As for [ORG UNCLOS  ] ratification , the Administration is in favor but there is not yet progress in the [ORG Senate  ] on ratification . 
[PER Sigurjonsson  ] added that [LOC Iceland  ] is not looking for increased militarization of the [LOC High North  ] , but wants to increase [ORG NATO  ] " situational awareness " of what is going on in the region . 
This is important to maintain [ORG Alliance  ] focus as well as public support. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Gunnarsdottir  ] opened discussion of the [MISC NATO Strategic Concept  ] by stating [LOC Iceland  ] 's hope that the exercise will prioritize tasks for the [ORG Alliance  ] as well as recommit Allies to the [ORG NATO  ] mission . 
The process of drafting the document can also be an important rallying point to reenergize public support . 
However , she noted , it is important to reiterate the importance of [ORG Article  ] 5 and strike a balance between the traditional [ORG NATO  ] Area of Responsibility and out-of-area operations . 
In this vein , smaller Allies' concerns about the process need to be addressed -- there needs to be common ownership of the final document , even if only a restricted group is [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000121 002 OF 004 involved in the drafting . 
[PER Garber  ] agreed that the drafting process will be very important in building support for the final document , but reiterated that the [MISC SecGen  ] needs to own the process . 
We have said we want the drafting effort to be as consultative as possible early on , but we have concerns that a document drafted " at 28 " will not truly be a [ORG Strategic Concept  ] . 
[LOC Russia  ] --------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) On [LOC Russia  ] , both sides observed that [MISC Russian  ] engagement is often uneven , and that while dialogue in the [ORG NATO Russia Council  ] is important , it is equally important for Allies to remain united . 
It was noted that the [MISC Russians  ] are very skillful at exploiting political divisions within the [ORG EU  ] and [ORG NATO  ] , and it is therefore critical for us to hold to our key principles on the indivisibility of security and the rejection of spheres of influence . 
[PER Sigurjonsson  ] said [LOC Iceland  ] does not want to exaggerate the importance of increased [MISC Russian  ] military activity near [LOC Iceland  ] , including new , more provocative flight patterns , but it is important that [ORG NATO  ] respond and maintain its capabilities accordingly . 
[PER DAS Garber  ] commented that the [LOC US  ] position is that the current [MISC European  ] security institutions are working well , and that in [LOC Corfu  ] and beyond we will not be looking to replace the current architecture . 
[PER Gunnarsdottir  ] concurred , though adding that in bilateral consultations with [LOC Russia  ] the previous day , [MISC Icelandic  ] officials heard clearly that [LOC Russia  ] does not believe the present security structure meets its needs . 
Still , [MISC Russian  ] officials have been less than forthcoming on details for their proposals of a new [MISC European  ] security institution , almost as if they have been waiting for the rest of [LOC Europe  ] to give them something substantive in response . 
[PER LtCol Anne Marie Fenton  ] , OSD-Policy , noted that it is important for [LOC Iceland  ] to try to move the [MISC Russians  ] in a productive direction , which [PER DAS Garber  ] seconded . 
( [ORG Note: Meeting  ] participants were informed later in the meeting that [MISC Russian  ] Tu-95 bomber aircraft had just entered the [MISC Icelandic  ] air traffic control sector on an unannounced long range aviation exercise . 
End Note . 
) [ORG Icelandic Defense Policy: Under Review  ] --------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG MFA Defense Department  ] Director [PER Thordur Aegir Oskarsson  ] and [ORG Iceland Defense Agency  ] ( [ORG IDA  ] ) Director [PER Tinna Vidisdottir  ] provided an overview of [MISC Icelandic  ] defense policy with a significant major caveat: the new government that took office after the April elections has called for a review of [ORG IDA  ] operations and the [ORG NATO  ] air surveillance mission in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
Despite the fact that much is still undecided -- and added pressure of state budgetary cuts required by [LOC Iceland  ] 's economic crisis -- the Foreign Minister has committed to fulfilling [LOC Iceland  ] 's defense and security obligations . 
Simultaneously , the government plans to carry out a policy-based review of the report produced by an [ORG MFA-appointed Threat Assessment Committee  ] in 2008 . 
While the previous report was descriptive in nature , this effort will be focused on policy prescriptions in an effort to prepare the ground for the upcoming budget , [PER Oskarsson  ] said . 
While acknowledging the uncertainty of [LOC Iceland  ] 's situation , the [LOC U.S.  ] side noted the importance of the government maintaining its commitments to [ORG NATO  ] , both in [LOC Iceland  ] and further afield . 
In particular , maintenance and operation of [ORG NATO  ] assets is key to retain the [ORG Alliance  ] 's capability to deploy to [LOC Iceland.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Discussion of [LOC Iceland  ] 's cooperation with neighboring states focused primarily on the report commissioned by the [MISC Nordic  ] Foreign Ministers on defense and security cooperation , known generally as the " [ORG Stoltenberg Report  ] " after its author , former [MISC Norwegian  ] Foreign and Defense Minister [PER Thorvald Stoltenberg  ] . 
[PER Gunnarsdottir  ] said the report had been very well-received and contained a number of good recommendations , though it also covered many areas in which the [MISC Nordic  ] countries are already working well together . 
It is important to carefully map out those areas to avoid duplication of existing efforts . 
[LOC Iceland  ] was particularly impressed by the report 's statements on the importance of the [MISC Arctic  ] , the idea of joint [MISC Nordic  ] diplomatic missions abroad , and the suggestion that [MISC Nordic  ] countries ( including non-NATO states ) participate in the air surveillance mission over [LOC Iceland  ] as well as the [MISC U.S.-Iceland  ] NORTHERN VIKING exercises . 
[PER Sigurjonsson  ] was careful to clarify that the [MISC Icelandic  ] Government views the suggestions in the report as a supplement to [LOC Iceland  ] 's activities with [ORG NATO  ] , not as a replacement . 
[PER DAS Garber  ] [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000121 003 OF 004 noted [LOC U.S.  ] support for the idea of closer security cooperation among the [MISC Nordics  ] , particularly if it provides a boost to efforts to cut costs and improve military capabilities in the region . 
Bilateral Initiatives: [ORG IADS  ] , Exercises , [ORG Coast Guard  ] --------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) A review of specific activities in bilateral defense cooperation focused on the status of the [LOC Iceland  ] Air [ORG Defense System  ] ( [ORG IADS  ] ) , planning for exercise and defense events for 2009-2013 , the status of the Military Representative Billet at [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy [LOC Reykjavik  ] , and the relationship between the [MISC Icelandic  ] and [ORG U.S. Coast Guards  ] . 
On [ORG IADS  ] , both parties agreed that due to the [MISC Icelandic  ] financial situation , action on the final transfer of [MISC U.S.-owned  ] equipment will be deferred until Fiscal Year 2010 . 
Although no political decision has been taken on upgrades , [LOC Iceland  ] 's [ORG NATO  ] Mission in [LOC Brussels  ] is exploring the technical issues related to possible [MISC NATO-funded  ] upgrades in 2011-2015 as part of [ORG Alliance  ] adoption of a next-generation radar system . 
[LOC Iceland  ] is also very interested in reestablishing the data link between [ORG IADS  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] NORTHCOM/NORAD , which [ORG Iceland Defense Agency  ] reps and a representative of [LOC NORTHCOM  ] discussed on the margins . 
Some operator-level discussions on this point have already taken place. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [ORG IDA  ] Head of [ORG Strategic Planning  ] Fridrik [ORG Jonsson  ] thanked the [LOC U.S.  ] for a successful September 2008 deployment of fighter aircraft for [ORG NATO  ] air policing in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
[LOC Iceland  ] is also happy to hear that the [LOC U.S.  ] has committed forces for a planned 2010 rotation . 
On NORTHERN VIKING exercises , there was agreement from both sides to shift from the annual schedule laid out in the 2006 Joint Understanding to a biannual schedule , with 2009 as an off year . 
[LOC U.S.  ] [MISC EUCOM Joint Training Readiness  ] and Exercises Representative [PER LTC Bill Crossen  ] outlined a proposed five-year plan for defense engagements , with two events planned per year in addition to scheduled air policing deployments in odd years . 
Exercise NORTHERN VIKING will be held in 2010 and 2012 , and beginning in 2011 [LOC U.S.  ] Army [LOC Europe  ] will also look to participate in the [ORG Icelandic Coast Guard  ] 's [ORG NATO  ] NORTHERN CHALLENGE explosive ordnance disposal ( [ORG EOD  ] ) exercise . 
Both sides agreed that the [MISC Stoltenberg Report  ] 's suggestion of [MISC Nordic  ] participation in NORTHERN VIKING and/or the air patrolling mission would be a positive addition. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) On the [MISC MilRep  ] position at Embassy [LOC Reykjavik  ] , OSD-Policy Representative [PER LtCol Fenton  ] reviewed [ORG CDR EUCOM  ] General [PER Craddock  ] 's decision to support the creation of a permanent billet , but noted that the modalities are still being worked out . 
In the interim , [ORG EUCOM  ] will fill the position in FY10 with an activated reservist . 
[ORG Icelandic Coast Guard  ] ( [ORG ICG  ] ) Director [PER Georg Larusson  ] then briefed on moves to boost ICG capabilities , including the acquisition of a new fixed-wing aircraft and patrol vessel as well as [LOC Iceland  ] 's chairmanship of the [ORG North Atlantic Coast Guard Forum  ] ( [ORG NACGF  ] ) . 
[LOC Iceland  ] will host the [ORG NACGF  ] Plenary in [LOC Akureyri  ] in September 2009 , where [LOC Norway  ] will take over as Chair . 
Both sides voiced support for continued exchange , building on the [MISC ICG-USCG Memorandum of Understanding  ] from 2008 , though [PER Larusson  ] cautioned that the ICG is under tremendous financial pressure and may need to adjust participation accordingly . 
Global Issues: Financial Crisis , [ORG Afghanistan-Pakistan  ] --------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The [ORG MFA  ] provided a briefing on the [MISC Icelandic  ] economic situation and the government 's response to the financial crisis , with a particular focus on the recently-negotiated agreement on deposit guarantees for the [MISC Icelandic-owned  ] [ORG Icesave  ] banks in [LOC Britain  ] and the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
Of note , Chief Negotiator for [ORG Trade Agreements Einar  ] [PER Gunnarsson  ] estimated that the sales of other bank assets would , even by conservative estimates , cover a large portion of the guarantees , possibly as much as 75 percent . 
Additionally , [PER Gunnarsson  ] described the government 's hope that a way forward can be found in dealing with the creditors of the failed [MISC Icelandic  ] banks so that they are awarded an ownership share in the new banks or some other means of profit-sharing in the future. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Both delegations agreed on the importance of success in implementing [ORG NATO  ] 's [LOC Afghanistan  ] strategy , and [PER Gunnarsdottir  ] emphasized that despite budget cuts , [LOC Iceland  ] does not intend to drop [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000121 004 OF 004 its level of support for the [MISC ISAF  ] mission . 
[PER Garber  ] welcomed this statement , and [PER Fenton  ] noted that the [ORG Icelandic Coast Guard  ] 's [ORG EOD  ] expertise would provide a great potential contribution to needs in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Additionally , better civil-military integration is necessary , and [PER Garber  ] and [PER Fenton  ] urged [LOC Iceland  ] to look at ways to assist in this regard in areas where [LOC Iceland  ] may have niche capabilities . 
[PER Garber  ] welcomed the [MISC Icelandic  ] delegation 's interest in possible [MISC Afghanistan-specific  ] consultations . 
In response to a question on public support for the [MISC Afghan  ] mission , [PER Gunnarsdottir  ] noted that the [MISC Icelandic  ] public has largely turned inward following the economic collapse . 
Support for foreign involvement in general has dropped , not just in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
That said , the [ORG Left-Green Movement  ] , formerly the party most opposed to [LOC Iceland  ] 's contribution to [ORG NATO  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , has mitigated its comments since coming into government in [LOC February.  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The two delegations agreed to hold the next round of expert-level talks in [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC D.C.  ] , though the [MISC Icelandic  ] side also urged that planning begin for a coming round of senior-level talks. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 .
