PLEASE HANDLE ACCORDINGLY. <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY: The [MISC Muslim  ] community in the [LOC Netherlands  ] is the second largest in [LOC Europe  ] as a percentage of total population ( 5.8 percent ) . 
It is also one of the least-well integrated and most alienated , and according to polls looks less favorably on the [LOC United States  ] than [MISC Muslim  ] communities elsewhere in [LOC Europe  ] . 
[MISC Muslims  ] in the [LOC Netherlands  ] are significantly poorer , less educated and more prone to arrest than native [MISC Dutch  ] . 
Their status has become the country 's most salient political issue and will be a key factor in upcoming local and national elections . 
This cable examines the [MISC Muslim  ] community , discusses tensions between it and traditional [MISC Dutch  ] society , and assesses some of the social and political consequences arising there from . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='parI' href='#parI'>¶</a>I . 
THE COMMUNITY ---------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Muslim  ] community in the [LOC Netherlands  ] numbers approximately 945,000 . 
According to official [ORG GONL  ] statistics , the majority are relatively recent immigrant " " guest workers " " and their descendants from [LOC Turkey  ] ( 365,000 ) and [LOC Morocco  ] ( 315,000 ) . 
Other [MISC Muslim  ] communities include [MISC Iranians  ] ( 29,000 ) , [MISC Iraqis  ] ( 44,000 ) and [MISC Somalis  ] ( 22,000 ) . 
Unlike [MISC Turkish  ] and [MISC Moroccan  ] guest workers , most from these smaller communities came to [LOC Holland  ] seeking political asylum . 
RAPID GROWTH ------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Between 1970 and 1995 , the number of [MISC Muslims  ] living in the [LOC Netherlands  ] rose from a few thousand to 630,000 , or 4.1 percent of the population . 
Most were poor , often from rural areas of [LOC Turkey  ] and [LOC Morocco  ] . 
Chosen to work in factory jobs , they tended to be uneducated and often illiterate . 
Unlike many [MISC Muslim  ] immigrants in [LOC Britain  ] and [LOC France  ] , those who came to the [LOC Netherlands  ] had no colonial connection or historic ties to their new homes , and did not speak the language . 
Assuming most would return to their country of origin , the [MISC Dutch  ] made few attempts to incorporate them into society. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Between 1995 and 2004 , the number of [MISC Muslims  ] rose to 945,000 , or 5.8 percent of the population . 
Although fewer are immigrating for economic reasons today , the [MISC Muslim  ] population continues to rise , largely because of high birthrates and the practice of [MISC Turkish  ] and [MISC Moroccan  ] immigrants marrying partners from their countries of origin . 
According to a September 20 , 2005 report on integration in the [LOC Netherlands  ] compiled by the [MISC Dutch  ] government , almost 90 percent of [LOC Turks  ] and [MISC Moroccans  ] marry spouses from their own communities ; of those , 60 percent bring partners from their home countries. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Dutch  ] define " " immigrants " " -- in [MISC Dutch  ] , " " allochtonen " " -- to include actual immigrants and secondgeneration descendants . 
Immigrants currently comprise roughly 16 percent of the population ; 5.8 percent of the population is [MISC Muslim  ] . 
[ORG URBAN  ] CONCENTRATION ------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The largest concentrations of [MISC Muslims  ] live in poor , segregated neighborhoods in [LOC Amsterdam  ] , [LOC Rotterdam  ] , The [ORG Hague  ] and [ORG Utrecht  ] . 
A recent study characterized these neighborhoods as deteriorating , with rampant social problems . 
According to the [LOC Amsterdam City Council  ] only 51 percent of those living in [LOC Amsterdam  ] are " " native " " [MISC Dutch  ] , compared to 55 percent five years ago. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The trend is similar in other big cities . 
The population of [LOC Rotterdam  ] is 621,000 , of which 189,000 or 30 percent are considered minorities . 
The [ORG Hague  ] 's population is 469,000 , of which 35 percent or 166,000 are minority . 
[ORG Utrecht  ] 's total population is 275,000 , 24 percent of which are minority residents . 
The fact that [MISC Muslim  ] minority populations are concentrated in cities has exacerbated tensions with native [MISC Dutch  ] in these communities . 
What the [MISC Dutch  ] term " " white flight " " is a disturbing trend in major cities . 
II . 
[ORG SOCIAL/POLITICAL ORGANIZATION  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Islamic  ] community is served by an extensive network of mosques and cultural centers , the majority of which accommodate [MISC Turkish  ] and [MISC Moroccan  ] communities . 
Of the country 's 400 mosques , more than 200 serve [LOC Turks  ] , some 140 serve [MISC Moroccans  ] , and roughly 50 serve [MISC Surinamese  ] . 
Mosques and cultural centers fall under a national system of subsidies that underwrites cultural activities , so nearly all receive government funds . 
There is significant foreign influence: almost all imams are foreign-born and many mosques receive funds from [LOC Turkey  ] and [LOC Saudi Arabia.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Most mosques are not controversial , but there are exceptions . 
[MISC Dutch  ] security services have at least five under intense surveillance , including [PER Al Fourqaan  ] in [LOC Eindhoven  ] , [LOC As-Soennah  ] in The [ORG Hague  ] and [PER Al Tawheed  ] in [LOC Amsterdam  ] . 
The government has recently taken contentious steps to limit the influence of such mosques , including proposing that foreign imams be barred from preaching . 
Last summer Immigration and Integration Minister [PER Rita Verdonk  ] declared three imams in [LOC Eindhoven  ] personae non grata for allegedly recruiting members for extremist groups . 
The three have been ordered to leave the country . 
One has done so ; the other two are appealing in court. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Despite pressure from right-wing politicians , the government has refrained from closing " " radical " " mosques . 
Many believe such a step would be perceived as a serious violation of [MISC Dutch  ] religious tolerance . 
Also , during a recent meeting with emboffs , [ORG National Counter-Terrorism Coordinator  ] [PER Tjibbe Joustra  ] said there is a debate on the wisdom of expelling radical imams because doing so might increase alienation and radicalization . 
[ORG ISLAMIC SCHOOLS  ] --------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Under the [MISC Dutch  ] education system , [MISC Muslim  ] schools are eligible for government funding , as are [MISC Catholic  ] and Protestant schools . 
[LOC Holland  ] has 47 [MISC Islamic  ] schools , including two secondary schools , and there are applications to open at least six more . 
The mainstream press regularly publishes sensationalist articles that such schools blacken their windows during [MISC Christmas  ] , expunge references to the Holocaust from their texts , and so forth . 
A representative of the [ORG Islamic Schools Administrative Organization  ] recently asserted that [MISC Muslims  ] are demanding [MISC Islamic  ] schools because of growing prejudice against the community , which " " feels that it is put offside in [ORG Dutch Society  ] and associates less and less with available institutions . 
" " Similarly , the [MISC Turkish  ] Embassy reports an increase in the number of [MISC Turkish  ] teenagers returning to [LOC Turkey  ] for school to escape what they view as growing anti-Muslim prejudice. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Although many observers have expressed concern that [MISC Islamic  ] schools perpetuate segregation and alienation , major political parties here are reluctant to cut funding since doing so would threaten funding for all religiouslyaffiliated institutions-- a mainstay of [MISC Dutch  ] society . 
Instead , schools with a high-percentage of non-native [MISC Dutch  ] students receive supplemental subsidies to help students learn [MISC Dutch  ] and to create a " " safe " " environment . 
[MISC Islamic  ] schools must meet the same curriculum criteria as any statefunded school . 
[MISC Dutch  ] classes are mandatory . 
POLITICAL REPRESENTATION ------------------------ <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) There is no effective political representation of the [ORG Dutch Muslim  ] community on the national level . 
While nine of the [ORG Second Chamber  ] 's 150 members are [MISC Muslim  ] , none speaks for a broader [MISC Muslim  ] constituency , and none has sought to play such a role . 
In part , this reflects the [MISC Dutch  ] political system , which discourages constituency-based politics in favor of disciplined national parties . 
Party leaders usually select parliamentary candidates for their perceived electability and standing within the party , and frown on members developing separate ethnic or regional followings. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On the local level , the situation is even more striking . 
In the three large cities where [MISC Muslims  ] are most heavily concentrated , they are severely underrepresented . 
[LOC Amsterdam  ] has one [MISC Muslim  ] alderman ; The [ORG Hague  ] and [LOC Rotterdam  ] have none . 
( The [LOC Amsterdam  ] alderman - [PER Ahmed Aboutaleb  ] - is the most popular politician among [MISC Dutch  ] [MISC Muslims  ] , according to a recent survey ) . 
Mayors and other senior officials in all three cities are non-Muslim . 
Despite large numbers of potential voters in these cities , voter turnout among [MISC Muslims  ] is low. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Groups within the [LOC Netherlands  ] have periodically floated the idea of starting a [ORG Dutch Islamic  ] party . 
In a recent poll of 500 [MISC Muslims  ] , almost half believed an [MISC Islamic  ] political party was desirable , but most also said it would be difficult for such a party to bridge the gap between [LOC Holland  ] 's disparate [MISC Muslim  ] communities . 
The [ORG Contact Body for Muslims and Government  ] is not a political party but as an advisory body to the government , claims to represent 80 percent of the [MISC Muslim  ] community . 
It acts as a sort of public mouthpiece for the various [MISC Muslim  ] communities and dialogues with the national government on social and political issues . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] government does not keep records on the voting patterns of individual ethnic or religious groups in the [LOC Netherlands  ] , so it is difficult to say which of the mainstream parties is most popular among the [MISC Muslim  ] community . 
III . 
SOCIAL FRICTIONS --------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Since the fall of 2001 and especially since the November 2004 killing of [PER Theo van Gogh  ] , resentment of [MISC Muslims  ] and [MISC Islamic  ] culture is increasingly apparent . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] public is moving toward the political right in their response to [MISC Muslim  ] issues , and their leaders are following suit . 
Populist politician [PER Pim Fortuyn  ] , who was murdered in 2002 , received broad support for his characterization of [MISC Islam  ] as " " a backward culture . 
" " Other politicians such as [PER Ayaan Hirsi Ali  ] and [PER Geert Wilders  ] regularly issue provocative statements about [MISC Islam  ] that stir outrage among [MISC Muslims  ] and pander to the prejudices of non-Muslims . 
While mainstream political leaders continue to preach integration rather than separation , nearly all have made tougher integration policies and cracking down on religious extremism part of their platform going into the next elections. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The two main pollsters in the [LOC Netherlands  ] recently wrote that " " fear of [MISC Islam  ] and irritation about insufficient integration of immigrants play a dominant brain position in the heads of native [MISC Dutch  ] . 
Whether we surveyed national security issues , religious statements or political preference , it appears again and again that negative sentiment towards immigrants and [MISC Muslims  ] have the upper hand , and significantly influence behavior and opinion . 
" " <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In January 2005 two-thirds of native [MISC Dutch  ] polled said they feared a terrorist attack by [MISC Muslim  ] fundamentalists . 
Asked about [MISC Muslims  ] in general , roughly one-third expressed negative opinions . 
Four in ten object to [MISC Muslims  ] bringing spouses from their home countries , arguing that such immigration hampers the integration of [MISC Muslims  ] in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
SEGREGATION AND DISCRIMINATION ------------------------------ <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) For its part , the [MISC Muslim  ] community convincingly argues that ingrained segregation and discrimination are facts of life in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
In a June 2005 report entitled " " Staying from Each Other 's [MISC Turf  ] " " the [MISC Dutch  ] government 's Social and [ORG Cultural Planning Bureau  ] found that two-thirds of native [MISC Dutch  ] have no contact with migrants outside work -- either because they do not live in their neighborhoods or because they deliberately avoid contact with them. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Seventy percent of [LOC Turks  ] , 60 percent of [MISC Moroccans  ] , and 50 percent of [MISC Somalis  ] have limited their social contacts to their own communities . 
The government planning bureau called it " " worrisome " " that [LOC Turks  ] and [MISC Moroccans  ] are increasingly withdrawing into their own communities and have less and less contact with " " white " " [MISC Dutch  ] . 
The lack of contact between communities in turn reduces incentives for immigrants to learn [MISC Dutch  ] and limits their ability to find jobs . 
Feelings of resentment are not exclusive among the lower and uneducated ethnic population , polls show that those with higher incomes and better educations who do come into regular contact with " " white " " [MISC Dutch  ] also tend to have the most negative opinion of [MISC Dutch  ] society , as they are more likely to experience direct discrimination on a regular basis both in the workplace and socially ( e.g. , at bars and clubs . 
) <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The education level of non-Western immigrants lags significantly behind native [MISC Dutch  ] , even though it has risen noticeably in the past 15 years . 
In 2003 , 15 percent of the non-western immigrants had completed higher education ( including both college and university ) , compared to 25 percent of native [MISC Dutch  ] . 
Participation of non-western immigrant women is higher education rose more rapidly than men . 
Of the non-Western immigrants more than 25 percent completed only elementary school. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) A recent study found that among equally qualified native [MISC Dutch  ] and [MISC Moroccan  ] students from mid-level vocational training colleges , [MISC Moroccan  ] students are 30 percent less likely to be invited for apprentice interviews than native [MISC Dutch  ] students . 
IV . 
SOCIAL/POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES --------------------------------- <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Social statistics paint a grim picture: sixteen percent of the minority population is unemployed compared to 6 percent of the majority population ; 25 percent receive welfare benefits versus 13 percent of the majority population and 29 percent live in poverty compared to 8 percent of native [MISC Dutch.  ] <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Dutch  ] society is only now coming to terms with the fact that many of the nearly one million [MISC Muslims  ] in the [LOC Netherlands  ] have poorly integrated . 
Even before the van [PER Gogh  ] murder , many [MISC Dutch  ] privately expressed frustration that large segments of the [MISC Muslim  ] and especially the [MISC Moroccan  ] community have been less successful at integrating into [MISC Dutch  ] society than previous immigrant groups . 
This perception is supported by statistics ; a recent INR poll , for example , found that nearly 80 percent of [MISC Dutch  ] [MISC Muslims  ] identified with their religion or ethnicity far more then the [LOC Netherlands  ] -- the highest percentage in [LOC Europe  ] . 
Ethnic minorities are also severely over represented in the crime figures . 
Younger members of first-generation non-Western ethnic minorities accounted for 35 percent of the prison population in 2004 . 
Not only does the lack of integration lead to more criminal activity , it also helps perpetuate stark social divides on issues such as the role of women , homosexual rights , and corporal punishment. <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Polls reveal that half of the native [MISC Dutch  ] population and half of the [LOC Turks  ] and [MISC Moroccans  ] believe that a [MISC Western  ] lifestyle is incompatible with a [MISC Muslim  ] lifestyle . 
Native [MISC Dutch  ] are primarily concerned about the position of [MISC Muslim  ] women , who they believe enjoy too few freedoms . 
[LOC Turks  ] and [MISC Moroccans  ] are mainly bothered by the perceived lack of respect for their cultures by native [MISC Dutch.  ] <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) There is growing support within the non-Muslim community that integration should be mandatory rather than voluntary . 
In this spirit , the [MISC Dutch  ] are taking a number of steps to force [MISC Muslims  ] to integrate , including obligatory language and integration courses for new immigrants . 
Despite the fact that 90 percent of new immigrants complete these courses , only 40 percent achieve sufficient language level to find employment. <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The government has also tightened immigration requirements to limit the prevailing practice of [MISC Muslims  ] bringing over partners from their home country . 
Labor and management organizations have also been brought into the discussion to improve the position of minorities on the labor market and enhance employment opportunities . 
POLITICAL OUTLOOK: ----------------- <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) All major parties recognize that " " integration " " will be a major issue in the March 2006 local elections and the May 2007 national vote . 
The government 's approach to integration -- which balances outreach to the [MISC Muslim  ] community with tougher immigration and anti-terrorism legislation -- enjoys wide-spread support in parliament , but has failed to resonate with the public at large . 
While it is still early , there are indications that popular pressures may drive most parties to the right on Muslim-related issues during the election campaigns. <a id='par29' href='#par29'>¶</a>29 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Some politicians , such as [PER Geert Wilders  ] , advocate significantly stronger measures , including a temporary ban on immigration , deprivation of [MISC Dutch  ] citizenship and expulsion of immigrants who commit serious crimes or fail to pass an integration exam . 
Less drastic , but also controversial , is the proposal by Labor party opposition leader [PER Wouter Bos  ] to link access to social benefits and government services for immigrants to progress made integrating into [MISC Dutch  ] society ; eligibility for such benefits would be phased-in gradually rather than provided on arrival as is currently the case. <a id='par30' href='#par30'>¶</a>30 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Toughening social and political attitudes towards [MISC Muslims  ] have not gone unnoticed by the [MISC Muslim  ] community . 
Approximately 3000 [MISC Dutch  ] [LOC Turks  ] returned to [LOC Turkey  ] last year , many claiming that they felt they no longer had a future in [LOC Holland  ] ( although improving economic prospects in [LOC Turkey  ] no doubt also played a role . 
) This fall a more boisterous opposition came in the form of 6,000 protestors from [MISC Muslim  ] organizations proclaiming , " " Enough is enough " " through the streets of [LOC Amsterdam  ] . 
In the long term [MISC Moroccans  ] and [LOC Turks  ] may successfully integrate into [MISC Dutch  ] society like the [MISC Surinamese  ] and [MISC Indonesians  ] before them , but in the near term feelings of alienation and mistrust continue to deepen and fester .
