[PER Eduardo A. Aguirre  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: The Ambassador hosted former President [PER Jose Maria Aznar  ] for a private lunch at his residence on October <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
President [PER Aznar  ] offered his opinions on the domestic political situation as well as the outlook in [LOC Latin America  ] . 
He also told Ambassador of his satisfaction at seeing improved [MISC United States-Spain  ] relations , despite the difficulties this presents to his party in opposition . 
He told the Ambassador that he fears the current government is presiding over the " [MISC Balkanization  ] " of [LOC Spain  ] . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) During their October 16 luncheon , former President [PER Aznar  ] told the Ambassador that he views with satisfaction the improving [ORG GOS  ] relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] over the past year . 
[PER Aznar  ] said that , as a [MISC Spaniard  ] , he accepts this as a positive development although it presents difficulties for his opposition [MISC Partido Popular  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) . 
( COMMENT: Maintaining the trans-Atlantic relationship has long been one of the [ORG PP  ] 's key platforms , and [ORG PP  ] leaders have hammered [PER Zapatero  ] for upsetting ties with [LOC Washington  ] . 
The [ORG PP  ] has also criticized the [PER Zapatero  ] government for steps it has taken that are important to the [LOC U.S.  ] , such as the [MISC Spanish  ] deployment to [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
While efforts to improve the bilateral relationship have eased the sting of this [ORG PP  ] criticism , [ORG PP  ] leaders apparently have viewed [MISC U.S.-Spain  ] tensions as favorable to their interests . 
[PER Aznar  ] 's comments may reflect a new approach on this subject . 
We have told both the [ORG PP  ] and the [ORG Socialist Party  ] now in power to avoid using the [LOC U.S.  ] in their political football , as this benefits neither [MISC Spanish  ] nor [LOC U.S.  ] interests . 
END COMMENT . 
) //Argentina , [LOC Chile  ] , [LOC Peru  ] , [LOC Colombia  ] , [LOC Mexico//  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Aznar  ] told the Ambassador about his recent speaking tour in [LOC Latin America  ] . 
He found that [LOC Argentina  ] is increasingly turning inward and that internal politics will be the dominant force in [LOC Argentina  ] for several years . 
In [LOC Chile  ] , he told the Ambassador that President [PER Bachelet  ] is strongly influenced by her father 's murder and her own torture during the [PER Pinochet  ] regime . 
[PER Aznar  ] said that these experiences are more profoundly shaping her executive decisions than he had previously believed . 
On [LOC Peru  ] , [PER Aznar  ] expressed his belief that [PER Alan Garcia  ] is a " new man " who has cast aside the legacy of his previous administration and who is deeply committed to creating stability and economic opportunity . 
He also said that President [PER Uribe  ] appears very secure and established in [LOC Colombia  ] . 
[PER Aznar  ] saw deep internal divisions in [LOC Mexico  ] , but he noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] border fence project is a unifying force of anti-American sentiment , to the detriment of [LOC U.S.  ] relations with [LOC Mexico.  ] //ETA , [ORG Basque Country  ] and [ORG Catalonia//  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Aznar  ] said he fears that the [ORG GOS  ] is presiding over the " [MISC Balkanization  ] " of [LOC Spain  ] , by allowing the autonomous communities greater independence . 
The [ORG PP  ] feels that by allowing the 2006 [LOC Catalonia  ] referendum on autonomy , the [ORG GOS  ] has opened the floodgates to demands for greater local control . 
Worse , by entering into negotiations with [ORG ETA  ] , the [ORG GOS  ] has nearly legitimized the [MISC Basque  ] self-determination movement . 
[PER Aznar  ] expressed his belief that the ongoing [ORG ETA  ] negotiations will fail . 
He said that the only way to deal with [ORG ETA  ] is as a criminal organization . 
The negotiations never had a chance for success , he said , because neither side ever had any room to maneuver or flexibility in their positions . 
According to [PER Aznar  ] , [ORG ETA  ] will never abandon its demand for [MISC Basque  ] self-determination , and the [ORG GOS  ] can never agree to that demand. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Adhering to the party line , [PER Aznar  ] expressed confidence that the [ORG PP  ] would win a slim plurality in the approaching [LOC Catalonia  ] regional election . 
[PER NOTE: Polling  ] indicates that the [MISC Catalan  ] " middle of the road " CiU party is likely to win the regional election , though it may have to form a tripartite coalition to govern ( reftel ) . 
The [ORG PP  ] is not even assured a place in that coalition , as it currently is polling at around 10 percent in the region .
