( C ) SUMMARY: Assistant Secretary for [LOC South  ] and [ORG Central Asian Affairs  ] [PER Richard Boucher’s August  ] 27 meetings with President [PER Karzai  ] , Foreign Minister [PER Spanta  ] , [ORG Lower House  ] Speaker [PER Qanooni  ] and [ORG National Security Advisor Rassoul  ] spanned a range of key topics . 
[PER Boucher  ] , [PER Karzai  ] and [PER Rassoul  ] agreed to focus on themes of economic cooperation , intelligence- sharing , refugees , controlling illicit border traffic , and engaging the tribes during the upcoming trilateral meeting between Deputy Secretary of [LOC State Negroponte  ] , [PER Rassoul  ] , and [ORG Pakistani National Security Advisor Aziz  ] . 
Karzai’s vision of a [ORG UN Special  ] Envoy to [LOC Afghanistan  ] largely mirrors [LOC U.S.  ] thoughts on the issue . 
Discussion of counternarcotics and governance led [PER Karzai  ] to make a pitch for the international community to give the [MISC Afghan  ] government room to do governance “the [MISC Afghan  ] way.” [PER Boucher  ] pressed [PER Spanta  ] and [ORG Qanooni  ] to ensure that Iran’s role in [LOC Afghanistan  ] is limited to a constructive one . 
End Summary. ------ JIRGAS ------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Karzai  ] seemed pleased when [PER Boucher  ] shared that the recent [MISC Afghanistan-Pakistan  ] jirga had been portrayed favorably in the [LOC U.S.  ] media . 
[PER Karzai  ] commented that six months would be an ideal time frame after which to host the next jirga in [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
Both agreed that the [MISC Afghan  ] jirga was an important confidence-building measure , but [PER Boucher  ] expressed his hope that the next jirga in [LOC Pakistan  ] might produce more concrete agreements . 
He raised the upcoming visit of Deputy Secretary of [LOC State Negroponte  ] as an opportunity to capitalize on the momentum of the jirga and ensure continued progress towards the next one . 
[PER Boucher  ] raised the idea of having the [MISC Afghan  ] and [ORG Pakistani National Security Advisors  ] meet together with [PER Negroponte  ] during his visit to [LOC Jalalabad  ] near the [MISC Afghan-Pakistani  ] border and proposed that the three work together to identify specific issues where the greatest cooperation is needed ( such as economic cooperation , intelligence-sharing and controlling illicit border traffic ) . 
[PER Boucher  ] also pushed for a discussion of how to engage the tribes along the border , whose buy-in is essential to the staying power of any future jirga agreements . 
[PER Karzai  ] , [PER Spanta  ] and [PER Rassoul  ] were each on board with this. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Karzai  ] shared that there was a recent gathering of [MISC Pakistani  ] tribal chiefs in [LOC Peshawar  ] during which the chiefs expressed a desire for the same rights and freedoms as ordinary [MISC Pakistani  ] citizens . 
However , [PER Karzai  ] noted that these same tribes had recently refused to celebrate [ORG Pakistani Independence Day  ] . 
[PER Karzai  ] said the [MISC Pakistani  ] government needed to pull tribal leaders into a system of formal representation , while [PER Boucher  ] noted that [MISC Pakistani  ] Interior Minister [PER Sherpao  ] did not think a political party system within the [ORG Tribal Areas  ] would be feasible in the near term. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In a separate discussion with [PER Boucher  ] , [ORG National Security Advisor Rassoul  ] said [PER Karzai  ] had initiated the process of finalizing the list of participants in the commission that will implement the agreements from the first jirga . 
[PER Boucher  ] seconded Sherpao’s desire to see a commission comprised of those “who can get things done.” In an encouraging sign , [PER Rassoul  ] acknowledged that [PER Sherpao  ] had been a very helpful partner in the lead-up to , execution of and follow-up to the first jirga . 
[PER Rassoul  ] stated that the first task would be to work on the continuation of dialogue with the “opposition , ” including [ORG Taliban  ] . 
[PER Boucher  ] pushed specifically for the jirga commission to identify who the opposition is and relayed Sherpao’s interest in bringing those “who are not part [LOC KABUL  ] 00002998 002 OF 006 of the [ORG Taliban  ] but sympathetic to them into the jirga process.” Both agreed that [MISC Afghanistan’s  ] official reconciliation process ( commonly referred to as “PTS” ) is not appropriate for high-level leaders and large groups , so the jirga commission could play a role in defining a more appropriate process for people in this category. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Boucher  ] shared his opinion that [LOC Pakistan  ] is “making a real effort now by going after the hardest targets , including [MISC Pakistani  ] and [MISC Arab  ] insurgents , ” which has already yielded results . 
[PER Rassoul  ] noted that his government is considering using the [ORG Provincial Communications Center  ] model ( currently used to coordinate information among the [ORG Afghan National Security Forces  ] at the provincial level ) to set up a nexus for intelligence-sharing between the [MISC Afghan  ] and [MISC Pakistani  ] governments . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] is concerned about [MISC Baluch  ] rebels who are operating in and supported from [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and [PER Boucher  ] stressed the importance of the [MISC Afghan  ] government doing all it can to crack down on this. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) During the meeting with [PER Spanta  ] , the Foreign Minister indicated that while he had been skeptical about the jirga himself , he had considered it a major success in the end . 
He said that the [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] was sending five newly appointed diplomats to [LOC Pakistan  ] for training -- a significant goodwill gesture following the jirga , as [LOC Afghanistan  ] has refused educational assistance from [LOC Pakistan  ] in the past . 
[PER Spanta  ] said Musharraf’s appearance at the end of the jirga was a real high point . 
[PER Boucher  ] emphasized that it was Karzai’s urging that changed Musharraf’s mind . 
[PER Boucher  ] clarified that Musharraf’s initial decision not to attend was not a snub to the jirga itself but a cautionary move by [PER Musharraf  ] , who feared the [ORG Pakistani Supreme Court  ] would rule to allow former Prime Minister [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] to return to [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[PER Spanta  ] conceded that , “We know [PER Sharif  ] is bad news . 
He is the author of [MISC Islamic  ] radicalism in our region.” [PER Boucher  ] agreed that [PER Sharif  ] could return to lead a movement that is pro-Islam , anti-Musharraf and anti- [LOC U.S.  ] ---------------- [ORG UN SPECIAL  ] ENVOY ---------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) When [PER Boucher  ] asked [PER Karzai  ] his thoughts on the best role for a [ORG UN Special  ] Envoy to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Karzai  ] stated , “If it would be a [ORG UN  ] Envoy that would bring better coordination among the international community at capitals and also cause better coordination in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and within the Alliance on [LOC Afghanistan  ] , then good . 
But if it is someone who would set up a parallel government of internationals , then no.” At one point [PER Karzai  ] stated , “I do not want a stronger [ORG UN  ] , ” then clarified that “I want the [ORG UN  ] to be a stronger coordinator of the international community , yes , but not a parallel government in [LOC Afghanistan.”  ] ( [ORG Note:  ] The [MISC British  ] have indicated their vision of a Special Envoy who would be based in and work primarily in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , whereas the [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Afghan  ] sides envision an envoy who would spend a great deal of time fund-raising and coordinating donor strategies in donor country capitals .

) <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) During his meeting with [PER Rassoul  ] , [PER Boucher  ] commented that the [MISC French  ] government had been considering running a [ORG Provincial Reconstruction Team  ] and that the [MISC French  ] Ministers of [LOC Defense  ] and [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] plan to visit [LOC Afghanistan  ] soon . 
[PER Boucher  ] , [PER Rassoul  ] , and the Ambassador discussed future prospects for other donor country involvement in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , noting that the [MISC Canadians  ] were “iffy” and that the [MISC Dutch  ] may leave after 2009 . 
The [MISC British  ] , [MISC French  ] , [MISC Australians  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] will likely stay [LOC KABUL  ] 00002998 003 OF 006 for longer periods . 
[PER Rassoul  ] asserted the importance of “Afghanizing” the war in [LOC Kandahar  ] both in order to reduce [MISC Canadian  ] casualties , which might encourage the [MISC Canadians  ] to stay longer , and to prepare the [ORG Afghan National Army  ] and police for [MISC Canada’s  ] likely withdrawal . 
[PER Boucher  ] noted that after a withdrawal of maneuver troops , the [MISC Canadians  ] may still be willing to run a [ORG Provincial Reconstruction Team  ] focused on development , as well as the training and equipping of [ORG Afghan National Security Forces  ] . 
[PER Boucher  ] noted that as 2009 is an election year , it would be good to encourage donor countries to stay throughout 2009- 2010 . 
He also expressed hope that efforts to engage [LOC Pakistan  ] now would increase security significantly in the next year or two , perhaps encouraging other countries to stay present in [LOC Afghanistan.  ] ------------------------------------ LOOKING AHEAD ON ERADICATION EFFORTS ------------------------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Boucher  ] noted that the [ORG UN Office of Drugs and Crime  ] had released its latest assessment of drug production in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
He highlighted the report’s findings that while the number of poppy-free provinces had increased from six to thirteen , overall production in [LOC Afghanistan  ] had increased by 34 per cent , particularly in [LOC Helmand  ] . 
[PER Karzai  ] reiterated his position against an aerial eradication campaign . 
When [PER Boucher  ] asked [PER Karzai  ] for his thinking on ground-based spray , [PER Karzai  ] replied , “We have not said no , but we’re not saying yes either . 
We would have to inform the population and do it in a way that does not create enmity.” The Ambassador noted the difficulties in relying on manual eradication and pointed out that 16 of the 135 eradicators had been killed last year . 
[PER Boucher  ] assured [PER Karzai  ] that the aerial spray decision was one for another year. “Another few years , ” [PER Karzai  ] interjected . 
[PER Boucher  ] planted the idea of eventually doing aerial spray in [ORG Taliban  ] controlled areas and manual eradication in those parts still loyal to the central government . 
[PER Karzai  ] gave no immediate reaction. ------------------------------------------- [PER KARZAI  ] ON DOING GOVERNANCE “THE [MISC AFGHAN  ] WAY” -------------------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The discussion on increased drug cultivation in [LOC Helmand  ] sparked Karzai’s thoughts on establishing and maintaining central government authority in the provinces . 
According to [PER Karzai  ] , “The question is why do we have [ORG Taliban  ] controlling these areas now when two years ago I had control of [LOC Helmand  ] ? 
When Sher [PER Mohammad  ] was governor there , we had girls in schools and only 160 foreign troops . 
The international community pushed me to remove him and now look where we are.” Referring to Sher [PER Mohammad  ] , [PER Karzai  ] retorted , “My question for you is , do you want a bad guy on your side or working for the [ORG Taliban  ] ? 
Where [MISC Afghans  ] are in charge , drugs are less but where the international community is in charge , drugs are up.” The Ambassador countered that the scenario is more accurately read as the international community has invested its resources and manpower in the tougher provinces where , not coincidentally , the [ORG Taliban  ] have stepped up their counterinsurgency and drug cultivation efforts to discredit both the [MISC Afghan  ] government and international community . 
[PER Karzai  ] conceded but added that the [MISC Afghan  ] people do not see it that way from the ground. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Pressing the issue more firmly , [PER Boucher  ] asked [PER Karzai  ] whether it is possible to have the [MISC Afghan  ] government in control using good guys , rather than the likes of Sher [PER Mohammad  ] as its agents. “Yes , but that is a gradual process , ” said [PER Karzai  ] . 
Maintaining that [LOC KABUL  ] 00002998 004 OF 006 “the most important thing is bringing the tribes to our side , ” he explained that the problem with the international community’s approach to date is that “You are trying to pick and choose tribal chiefs ( who will expand the presence of the central government into rural areas ) , but that is not how the tribal system works . 
A tribal chiefdom is jealously guarded . 
It cannot be taken by force and it cannot be imposed from the outside . 
When we distort tribal structures , the vacuum is filled by the [ORG Taliban  ] , and that is exactly what has happened in [LOC Helmand  ] and [LOC Uruzgan.”  ] He noted that [LOC Kandahar  ] is an exception because of his outreach to all the tribal chiefs there . 
According to [PER Karzai  ] , “the people in [LOC Helmand  ] and [LOC Uruzgan  ] are uneducated , so you have to fight the [ORG Taliban  ] with local ingredients , ” unlike in more developed [LOC Kandahar  ] . 
He added , “We cannot bring tribal chiefs on board with governors because we say to them that we want you to support the governor , but we single out particular chiefs and say we don’t want them involved in the process . 
Whether we like it or not , we have to work with these people.” [PER Karzai  ] and [PER Rassoul  ] both indicated that [PER Karzai  ] is currently focused on an outreach campaign to win backing from tribal leaders in [LOC Helmand.  ] --------------------------------------------- ------ ROLE OF [LOC IRAN  ] , LOCAL OPPOSITION MUST BE CONSTRUCTIVE --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Boucher  ] informed [PER Karzai  ] that he would meet with [ORG Lower House  ] Speaker [PER Qanooni  ] later that day . 
[PER Boucher  ] told [PER Karzai  ] that his message to [PER Qanooni  ] would be: “Political opposition is okay , but it has to be constructive.” Karzai’s advice was to remind [PER Qanooni  ] that he would not hold his position without [LOC U.S.  ] backing . 
As the conversation turned to political parties , [PER Karzai  ] commented , “I will not be a political party man , but I will support parties , ” presumably referring to his rumored alliance with the newly formed [MISC Republican  ] [ORG Party.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) During the meeting with [PER Qanooni  ] , [PER Boucher  ] emphasized that [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Russia  ] should not be given inroads for influence in a way that would disrupt the system . 
[PER Boucher  ] clarified that while [MISC Iran’s  ] investment in cultural and educational institutions was acceptable , its role in smuggling weapons into [LOC Afghanistan  ] was not . 
[PER Qanooni  ] responded by assuring [PER Boucher  ] and the Ambassador that [LOC Afghanistan  ] continues to see the [LOC U.S.  ] as its “long-term partner.” Stressing that “We are not asking [MISC Afghans  ] to choose sides , ” [PER Boucher  ] expressed [LOC U.S.  ] understanding for Afghanistan’s need to cultivate cooperative economic , business , cultural , and “normal” political relationships with [LOC Iran  ] but reiterated that the line should be drawn at any activities that are disruptive to the establishment of a strong central government in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Qanooni  ] indicated that , aside from [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Russia  ] , people allied with the [ORG Hizb-i-Islami Gulbuddin  ] party continue to seek more positions of influence within the [MISC Afghan  ] government administration. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Pointing out that , “The security problems in southern [LOC Afghanistan  ] are spreading to the north , ” [PER Qanooni  ] added that , “While others think the security situation will remain in control , I and other members of [ORG Parliament  ] have some concerns.” He pointed to recent [ORG Taliban  ] activity in [LOC Kapisa  ] , [LOC Nuristan  ] , and [LOC Baghlan  ] as evidence of this. “Only Panjshir is protected , ” he stated . 
When [PER Boucher  ] asked how [ORG Taliban  ] are able to operate in the north , where [MISC Pashtuns  ] are a minority , [PER Qanooni  ] insisted that the [ORG Taliban  ] have located and begun to infiltrate the predominantly [MISC Pashtun  ] districts which are scattered around the north. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER Qanooni  ] mentioned the formation of a special committee from the [ORG Lower House  ] that will be [LOC KABUL  ] 00002998 005 OF 006 investigating why decisions made by [ORG Parliament  ] are not implemented by the executive branch . 
( Note: He was referring primarily to the decision of [ORG Parliament  ] to impeach Foreign Minister [PER Spanta  ] and Minister of Refugees Akbar . 
[PER Karzai  ] mentioned that the Palace has also established a committee of six ministers to settle the issue with [ORG Parliament  ] . 
End note . 
) <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) The topic of [LOC Iran  ] also surfaced during [MISC Boucher’s  ] meeting with [PER Spanta  ] , who acknowledged , “We agree with the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC U.K.  ] that [LOC Iran  ] is engaged in a lot of interference , but our interest in dealing with [LOC Iran  ] is to be careful not to open a second front along the [MISC Iranian  ] border with [LOC Afghanistan.”  ] [PER Spanta  ] noted the [MISC Afghan  ] government’s recent decision to reject a Memorandum of Understanding on military cooperation proposed by [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Spanta  ] also shared that [PER Karzai  ] had raised the issue of [MISC Iran’s  ] involvement in smuggling weapons into [LOC Afghanistan  ] with [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Ahmedinejad  ] , who [PER Spanta  ] said , “denied it , of course , but the point was made.” [PER Spanta  ] noted that [LOC Iran  ] was primarily invested in supporting political parties , mobilizing [MISC Shia  ] mullahs , influencing the [MISC Afghan  ] media , and providing material support to the [ORG Taliban  ] . 
He added that [LOC Iran  ] is funding the completion of a railway that will go from [LOC Iran  ] into [LOC Afghanistan  ] and end outside [LOC Herat City  ] . 
[PER Spanta  ] expressed his uncertainty about the complicity of the [MISC Iranian  ] Foreign Minister in providing material support to the [ORG Taliban  ] , stating that “He promised me he is not involved , but said that he is involved in supporting political parties in [LOC Afghanistan.”  ] <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [PER Spanta  ] commented that his biggest problem is that [LOC Iran  ] continues to send back [MISC Afghan  ] refugees - both those who are registered and those who are not - and added that [LOC Iran  ] does not coordinate with the [MISC Afghan  ] government on the forced returns. ----------------------------- [ORG REGIONAL ECONOMIC COOPERATION  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [PER Spanta  ] explained that [LOC Afghanistan  ] continues to work with [LOC Pakistan  ] on transit trade and updating their formal treaty from the 1960’s . 
They would also like to address this in the framework of [MISC South Asian Association  ] for [ORG Regional Cooperation  ] . 
[MISC Afghan  ] Commerce Minister [PER Farhang  ] will travel to [LOC Pakistan  ] shortly in hopes of making some progress . 
[PER Spanta  ] moved next to a request for [LOC U.S.  ] financial assistance for the upcoming conference of the [ORG Economic Cooperation Organization  ] ( [ORG ECO  ] ) , October 16-20 , 2007 in [LOC Herat  ] , which is focused on regional economic cooperation between [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Azerbaijan  ] , [LOC Kazakhstan  ] , [LOC Kyrgyzstan  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] , [LOC Turkmenistan  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Tajikistan  ] , [LOC Uzbekistan  ] , and [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[PER Boucher  ] promised to pass on the request but cautioned [PER Spanta  ] that the prospects were not good given how soon the conference would take place and the lack of [LOC U.S.  ] membership in the organization. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) [PER Boucher  ] stressed to [PER Karzai  ] and [PER Spanta  ] the need to follow-up on the success of the [ORG Tajik- Afghanistan  ] bridge opening with a trucking and transit agreement that allows [MISC Afghan  ] and [MISC Tajik  ] vendors and distributors to transport their goods across the border . 
The Ambassador pitched the idea of a truck leasing consortium project that would allow small- scale distributors , who could not afford to own trucks , to rent them when transporting their products . 
Both [PER Karzai  ] and [PER Spanta  ] welcomed the idea . 
[PER Spanta  ] noted that [MISC Afghan  ] Commerce Minister [PER Farhang  ] will soon travel to [LOC Pakistan  ] to discuss similar issues. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) [PER Spanta  ] also noted that the [MISC Chinese  ] are increasingly interested in becoming a regional economic partner as well as knowing more about what the larger international community is doing to invest in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[LOC KABUL  ] 00002998 006 OF 006 <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) Note: Renewed focus on regional economic cooperation will be part of the agenda for the upcoming [LOC Afghanistan  ] Ministerial Meeting on September 23 ( co-chaired by President [PER Karzai  ] and Secretary General [PER Ban Ki-Moon  ] ) that will precede the [ORG UN General Assembly  ] . 
The October 3 meeting of the [ORG Joint Coordination and Monitoring Board  ] will also focus on regional economic cooperation . 
This will be an important follow-up to the success of the [ORG Tajik- Afghanistan  ] bridge opening and an opportunity to capitalize on the momentum of the jirga , with economic cooperation presenting a clear win-win for all parties involved . 
End note. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 .
