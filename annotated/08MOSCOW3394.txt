( C ) At a November 20 meeting , BP’s new Group VP for [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC Kazakhstan  ] , [PER David Peattie  ] , told the Ambassador that [ORG BP  ] is in [LOC Russia  ] for the long-term . 
The troubled partnership in [ORG TNK-BP  ] ( ref A ) is only a part of their involvement and he said [ORG BP  ] would not be surprised to see the company split up and taken over by [ORG Gazprom  ] and [ORG Rosneft  ] within 2 years . 
[ORG BP  ] is actively pursuing options with both companies for the future . 
In the interval , [PER Peattie  ] confirmed that [ORG BP  ] has agreed to [PER Denis Morozov  ] , formerly with [ORG Norilsk Nickel  ] , as the new CEO and said he expects [PER Morozov  ] may prove more independent than the [ORG AAR  ] partners will like . 
He predicted [MISC Russian  ] oil production will drop by between three and five percent as companies contract capital spending in light of oil prices and credit constraints . 
With regard to [ORG CPC  ] ( refs B and C ) , [PER Peattie  ] said [ORG BP  ] is holding up the expansion as a negotiating tactic but plans to exit [ORG CPC  ] ( and [LOC Kazakhstan  ] ) by selling its stake in two parts to [ORG KazMunaiGaz  ] ( [ORG KMG  ] ) and [ORG Lukoil  ] . 
End summary. -------------------------------- [ORG TNK-BP  ] AND BP’S FUTURE IN [LOC RUSSIA  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Peattie  ] told the Ambassador that [ORG BP  ] plans to be in [LOC Russia  ] “for the next 50 years” and is thinking of the long-run in terms of its investments . 
He said [ORG TNK-BP  ] is a large and important part of BP’s presence but might not be the main vehicle for [ORG BP  ] going forward . 
In that regard , he noted that [ORG BP  ] had invested $8 billion in [ORG TNK-BP  ] but had already realized $9 billion in profits . 
Instead , he cited BP’s growing ties with [ORG Rosneft  ] , in which it has a one percent stake , as the potential long-term foundation of BP’s involvement in [LOC Russia  ] . 
[PER Peattie  ] said to that end , [ORG BP  ] was increasing its direct presence in [LOC Russia.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Peattie  ] said [ORG TNK-BP  ] would still be important to [ORG BP  ] in the near term and he thought that for the next 18 months or so , BP’s interests would align with those of [ORG AAR  ] , its partners in [MISC TNK-BP.  ] “We both want to see dividends and a more efficient company , ” he said . 
He believes [ORG AAR  ] , despite its short-term thinking , will be cooperative because the [ORG AAR  ] partners are “desperate for cash.” [PER Peattie  ] said [ORG BP  ] had erred in not developing better ties with [ORG AAR  ] and the [MISC Russian  ] Government , and its new [LOC Russia  ] team would make that a priority. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Peattie  ] confirmed that [ORG BP  ] has agreed to the choice of [PER Denis Morozov  ] , the former head of [ORG Norilsk Nickel  ] , as the new CEO of [ORG TNK-BP  ] , saying [ORG BP  ] was “content” with the choice . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] Finally , he said [ORG BP  ] is also counting on a dozen new boards of [ORG TNK-BP  ] subsidiaries to prevent further damage to company operations from decisions of the board of the parent company. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Peattie  ] said that over the medium-term , in two to three years , [ORG BP  ] expects [ORG TNK-BP  ] will be taken over by the [MISC Russian  ] Government and split into separate oil and gas components that [ORG Rosneft  ] and [ORG Gazprom  ] will control respectively . 
[ORG BP  ] expects to continue to play a role in developing the underlying assets and is in continuous negotiations with both [MISC Russian  ] companies on long-term partnerships. ---------- OIL PRICES ---------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Peattie  ] said that even at today’s lower oil prices , [ORG TNK-BP  ] is “making money , ” though not on current exports , due [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00003394 002 OF 002 to fluctuating export taxes . 
He predicted that [MISC Russian  ] oil production would decline between 3 and 5 percent in 2009 , given the disincentives for upstream production , falling prices , and the credit crunch . 
He said [ORG BP  ] foresees about a year and a half of relatively weak oil prices -- in the range of $50 to $70 per barrel -- followed by a return to $90-$100 per barrel oil as the world economy strengthens and the underlying supply and demand patterns reemerge . 
He explained that prices are likely to stabilize at $90 because that is the marginal cost of producing [MISC Canadian  ] “heavy oil” or oil sands , which would alleviate supply constraints. --- [ORG CPC  ] --- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) On pending expansion of the [ORG Caspian Pipeline Consortium  ] ( [ORG CPC  ] ) pipeline , in which [ORG BP  ] is a partner , [PER Peattie  ] said [ORG BP  ] is withholding its approval of the most recent expansion agreement ( refs B and C ) as a “negotiating tactic” in its talks to sell out its share to [ORG KMG  ] and [ORG Lukoil  ] . 
He explained that [ORG BP  ] plans to be out of [ORG CPC  ] and the sale to [ORG KMG  ] of the share [ORG BP  ] inherited from [ORG Amoco  ] is almost complete . 
[ORG BP  ] is trying to sell the share it inherited from [ORG Arco  ] to [ORG Lukoil  ] . 
Once complete , according to [PER Peattie  ] , [ORG BP  ] will be out of [LOC Kazakhstan  ] altogether , and will focus on its investments in [LOC Russia  ] and the [ORG BTC  ] oil pipeline ( from [LOC Azerbaijan  ] to [LOC Turkey  ] ) . 
[ORG BP  ] is also interested in [MISC Turkmen  ] gas , but that is a longer term prospect .
