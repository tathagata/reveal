They outlined the main sectors in which [MISC Chinese  ] companies work in [LOC Libya  ] , as well as the challenges these firms face . 
According to [PER Zhan  ] , [MISC Chinese  ] companies face some of the same challenges as [MISC American  ] firms doing business in [LOC Libya  ] , including delays in securing visa approvals , dealing with capricious and suddenly-announced commercial laws ( like the residency visa fees ) , and having to double-track issues through the opaque [MISC Libyan  ] bureaucracy .

] [ORG China Railway Construction  ] ( [ORG CRC  ] ) is working on the 172 km stretch of railway between [LOC Tripoli  ] and [PER Ras Edjeer  ] and the line between [LOC Al-Khums  ] ( east of [LOC Tripoli  ] ) and [ORG Sirte  ] . 
[ [ORG Note: Russian Railways  ] is working on the 554 km railroad line between [ORG Sirte  ] and [ORG Benghazi  ] . 
End note . 
] [ORG CRC  ] is also working on the 800 km railroad line between [LOC Misrata  ] , on the [LOC Mediterranean Coast  ] , and [LOC Sebha  ] , in southern [LOC Libya.  ] ...AND ALSO ACTIVE IN TELECOMS 5 . 
( C ) [MISC Chinese  ] firms are also active in [LOC Libya  ] 's telecommunications sector . 
In April , the firm [ORG Huawei Technologies Co.  ] , [ORG Ltd.  ] won a contract with [ORG Libya Telecom and Technology  ] ( [ORG LTT  ] ) to deploy " fiber to the home " networks for households in 800 homes on the [ORG Airport Road  ] in [LOC Alzohor District  ] in [LOC Tripoli  ] in the first phase . 
The firm plans to expand network coverage to other districts in the project 's second phase . 
In 2008 the [MISC Chinese  ] telecommunications equipment supplier [ORG ZTE Corporation  ] won a USD 58 million network expansion contract from [ORG Libyana  ] , one of two [MISC Libyan  ] mobile network operators . 
The deal enables [ORG Libyana  ] to expand its existing network from 1 million to 6.5 million lines . 
[ [ORG Note: Libyana  ] is one of two mobile phone operators owned by the [ORG General Post and Telecommunications Company  ] ( [ORG GPTC  ] ) , the other being [PER Al Madar  ] .

THE CNPC-VERENEX SAGA 6 . 
( C ) Econoff raised the issue of the pending sale of [MISC Canadian  ] oil company [ORG Verenex  ] to the [ORG Chinese National Petroleum Company  ] ( [ORG CNPC  ] ) ( reftel ) . 
While [ORG CNPC  ] has made a play at acquiring [MISC Canadian  ] oil firm [ORG Verenex  ] - the only successful oil exploration company in [LOC Libya  ] thus far - it has not enlisted the help of the [ORG PRC  ] Embassy in lobbying the [MISC Libyan  ] government on its behalf . 
[PER Zhan  ] said he heard the proposed deal was " unsuccessful , " as he had heard [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG National Oil Company  ] ( [ORG NOC  ] ) would not approve [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000741 002.2 OF 002 the [ORG CNPC  ] sale because the [ORG NOC  ] desired to purchase [ORG Verenex  ] . 
[ [ORG Note:  ] The [ORG CNPC  ] offer to purchase [ORG Verenex  ] expired on August 24 , and [ORG CNPC  ] did not move to renew that offer . 
End Note . 
] WITH HEADACHES OVER VISAS AND CUMBERSOME [MISC LIBYAN  ] BUREAUCRACY 7 . 
( C ) [PER Zhan  ] commented [MISC Chinese  ] firms had complained about " sudden and unreasonable regulations " that caused work delays and related increases in operating costs . 
For example , the recent new decree requiring foreign workers to pay fees for residency permits ( 500 [MISC Libyan  ] dinars , equivalent to about USD 400 ) had caused construction firms' costs to sky-rocket . 
He characterized the [MISC Libyan  ] government as " inefficient " and lacking coordination among various entities . 
On visas , for example , he said approvals had to be obtained not only from immigration officials but also from the [ORG Labor Office  ] , and there was little coordination between the two . 
As a result , companies often have to wait several months for visa approvals for their employees . 
Additionally , [PER Zhan  ] noted that many [MISC Chinese  ] companies have had trouble importing equipment needed for projects due to new " fees " that are suddenly imposed on those imports . 
COMMENT <a id='par8' href='#par8'>Â¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Comment: [MISC Chinese  ] companies have carved out some niches for themselves in the [MISC Libyan  ] market , namely in construction and telecommunications . 
Anecdotal evidence indicates that the [MISC Chinese  ] commercial presence in [LOC Libya  ] is growing , with scores of [MISC Chinese  ] workers thronging flights between [LOC Tripoli  ] and [ORG Benghazi  ] , and [MISC Turkish  ] Air flights regularly sold out with [MISC Chinese  ] workers transiting [LOC Istanbul  ] en route to [LOC Libya  ] . 
Nevertheless , [MISC Chinese  ] companies appear to face some of the same challenges as [MISC American  ] firms , most of which seem to originate from [LOC Libya  ] 's opaque bureaucracy .
