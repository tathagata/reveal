Waser  ] . 
Reason: 1.4 ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [MISC Summary: Events  ] in [LOC Georgia  ] have dominated the news and discussion here like few other events in recent memory . 
[MISC Latvians  ] , at least ethic [MISC Latvians  ] , look at [LOC Georgia  ] and think that this could easily be them . 
As the [ORG EU  ] and [ORG NATO  ] have been unable to respond forcefully to [LOC Russia  ] -- and many members advocate for a balanced approach -- [MISC Latvians  ] are beginning to worry if membership in these two organizations provides them the assurances of their security that they had hoped for when they joined . 
So far , the [LOC US  ] willingness to take a tough line in opposition to [MISC Russian  ] actions and in support of [LOC Georgia  ] has been well received here , but some key figures are asking if the west is fully prepared to deal with a resurgent [LOC Russia  ] . 
We expect that the [MISC Latvians  ] will make additional requests for tangible signs of our commitment to their security in coming weeks and months . 
A wild card in [MISC Latvian  ] thinking is how the personal economic ties many key players have with [LOC Russia  ] will influence their thinking - and whether they continue to believe that they can separate politics and business with [LOC Russia.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Summary , cont 'd . 
Also influencing events is the fact that roughly one third of the country is ethnic [MISC Russian  ] , who receive much of their information from [LOC Moscow  ] based or affiliated news sources . 
Their perceptions of the crisis in [LOC Georgia  ] and our role are diametrically opposed to those above and are a reminder of the serious ethnic divide in [LOC Latvia  ] . 
Unfortunately , while these events have highlighted the need for greater integration in [LOC Latvia  ] , the resulting political tensions have made integration that much more difficult to achieve . 
End summary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [LOC Georgia  ] dominates here at the moment . 
Most any conversation includes some discussion of the situation , newscasts and newspapers are covering little else , and internet discussions are lively and have wide participation . 
Among [MISC Latvians  ] , at least ethnic [MISC Latvians  ] , what you hear is a sense that this could have been us . 
Recalling their own history with [LOC Russia  ] , [MISC Latvians  ] have been visibly demonstrating their support for and solidarity with [LOC Georgia  ] . 
An August 11 march , advertised only through mentions on newscasts and online posts , drew over 1,000 people in support of [LOC Georgia  ] . 
Candle lightings outside the [MISC Georgian  ] Embassy are well attended and [MISC Georgian  ] flags can be seen around [LOC Riga  ] . 
Anecdotal evidence suggests that sales of [MISC Georgian  ] wine and mineral water have increased. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In discussing events in [LOC Georgia  ] , most [MISC Latvians  ] we talk to say that they feel the value of [ORG NATO  ] and [ORG EU  ] membership and believe that the possibility that the same thing could happen to them is greatly reduced . 
At the same time , the divisions in both organizations over how to deal with [LOC Russia  ] worry [MISC Latvians  ] . 
Comments by [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador to [LOC Latvia  ] Veshnyakov that the [LOC Baltics  ] and [LOC Poland  ] should not " rush to judgment " lest they encounter " unforeseen consequences " did not put any nerves at ease . 
We reported on MFA views on a full re-evaluation of relations with [LOC Russia  ] and frustration with [ORG NATO  ] and [ORG EU  ] positions ( Ref A ) , but it is also worth noting some of the public comments of key opinion leaders here . 
Former President [PER Vike-Freiberga  ] said she was " surprised and disappointed " that an emergency [ORG GAERC  ] was not convened until August 13 and that the [ORG EU  ] " failed to come out with a common , coordinated and condemning stance , " in contrast to the joint statement by the [MISC Baltic  ] and [MISC Polish  ] Presidents . 
[PER Aivars Ozolins  ] , perhaps the country 's most influential columnist , wrote that the crisis has exposed " serious divisions " in the west on relations with [LOC Russia  ] and argued that [LOC Latvia  ] must demand clear plans from [ORG NATO  ] to defend its territory . 
He concluded one recent column with the line , " We are in a new cold war and [LOC Latvia  ] is on the front line . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The question of what [LOC Latvia  ] does in response is also vexing to key figures . 
PM [PER Godmanis  ] was widely praised for his visit to [LOC Georgia  ] with [MISC Baltic  ] , [MISC Polish  ] and [MISC Ukrainian  ] leaders , and for delivering a strong message of support ( and President [PER Zatlers  ] has been criticized for not cutting short his visit to the [MISC Olympics  ] in [LOC China  ] ) . 
The parliament adopted a tough resolution critical of [LOC Russia  ] and calling on the [ORG EU  ] and [ORG NATO  ] to reconsider their approach to [LOC Moscow  ] . 
[LOC Latvia  ] has reaffirmed its strong support for MAP for both [LOC Georgia  ] and [LOC Ukraine  ] . 
But [MISC Latvians  ] are frustrated that they cannot do more to influence the situation directly . 
They want to be an active voice in debates at both headquarters in [LOC Brussels  ] , but feel lost between the big powers . 
They see their best hopes as getting the [MISC Nordics  ] on board with the [LOC Baltics  ] , [LOC Poland  ] and [LOC Czech Republic  ] and are heartened by what they view as realistic comments on a " changed situation with [LOC Russia  ] " coming out of [LOC Stockholm  ] and [LOC Helsinki  ] in particular . 
Former [ORG RIGA  ] 00000496 002 OF 003 FM Pabriks told the Ambassador that " Now it is important that [LOC Latvia  ] works to convince the [ORG EU  ] that there is no business as usual with [LOC Russia  ] . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) In this , though , [LOC Latvia  ] will face its own internal challenges . 
Many people in [LOC Latvia  ] , including key political figures , have very lucrative business relationships with [LOC Russia  ] that they fear losing . 
It was telling that FM [MISC Riekstins  ] , asked about the future of bilateral relations , remarked that " business is business . 
" ( ref B ) Leaders of the [ORG People 's Party  ] , to which [MISC Riekstins  ] belongs , have many business deals with [LOC Russia  ] , notably in the energy sector . 
Transport minister [PER Ainars Slesers  ] , who has made a fortune off real estate and transit deals that rely heavily on [LOC Russia  ] , stated at the parliamentary debate on [LOC Georgia  ] that " although [LOC Russia  ] clearly crossed a line a in its response , we need to at least consider whether [PER Saakashvili  ] does not bear some blame for provoking this crisis . 
" From sensitive sources , we understand that immediately after the crisis broke out , the [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador to [LOC Latvia  ] called [PER Slesers  ] and former PM ( and [ORG People 's Party  ] founder ) [PER Andris Skele  ] to explain [LOC Russia  ] 's position . 
We think it is no accident that he called two of [LOC Latvia  ] 's three oligarchs ( and while he didn't call [PER Aivars Lembergs  ] directly , he also called the parliamentary leader of the party closest to [PER Lembergs  ] ) to try to play the business card to build political support for [LOC Russia  ] . 
As the days move on , key figures in [LOC Latvia  ] will likely find that they face much tougher choices on relations with [LOC Russia  ] than just whether to cease [ORG NATO  ] military cooperation with [LOC Russia  ] or end [ORG EU  ] negotiations on visa facilitation . 
The one exception to this may be PM [PER Godmanis  ] . 
As reported in other channels , he immediately recognized the possibility for [MISC Russian  ] retaliation through the energy sector and ordered contingency plans drawn up . 
Unfortunately , we expect that the first instincts of many of the other political players will be to do everything they can to preserve their personal business deals , clinging to their naive idea that business and politics with [LOC Russia  ] can be separated. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) One area where we do expect to see concrete actions by the [MISC Latvians  ] is to increase their military preparedness . 
PM [PER Godmanis  ] was clear with the Ambassador that this needed to be done , even knowing the costs involved . 
( ref C ) The Defense Minister has stated publicly that [LOC Latvia  ] needs to review its own defense posture and privately told us that he will look for [LOC US  ] assistance in this project . 
We can expect further political calls for a comprehensive [ORG NATO  ] plan to defend the [LOC Baltics  ] . 
Former FM Pabriks suggested to us that [LOC Latvia  ] needs to look at increasing the size of its military forces , noting that [LOC Georgia  ] , less than twice as large as [LOC Latvia  ] , had 2,000 troops in [LOC Iraq  ] when [LOC Latvia  ] had a hard time finding even 100 to deploy. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The aspect of the [LOC Georgia  ] crisis that has ethnic [MISC Latvian  ] especially nervous is the [MISC Russian  ] claim that they went in to [LOC Georgia  ] to protect [MISC Russian  ] citizens . 
[LOC Latvia  ] 's population is nearly one-third ethic [MISC Russian  ] and half of those , more than 420,000 people , are not citizens of [LOC Latvia  ] . 
While only a small number ( estimated at roughly 20,000 ) have [MISC Russian  ] citizenship , [LOC Russia  ] has been taking steps to increase ties with these " compatriots " through steps such as waiving visa requirements to enter [LOC Russia  ] and providing access to educational and social benefits in [LOC Russia  ] . 
This population gets its information from a completely separate media space that relies heavily on [LOC Moscow  ] sources for its foreign news . 
As a result , [MISC Russian  ] language media here is talking of [MISC Georgian  ] 'genocide' in [LOC South Ossetia  ] , suggesting that the [LOC US  ] endorsed [PER Saakashvili  ] 's move on [MISC Tsinkvali  ] in advance , and drawing parallels to [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
( septel will report on this in greater detail ) <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Some [MISC Latvians  ] recognize that the lesson of [LOC Georgia  ] is that [LOC Latvia  ] needs to do more to integrate its ethnic [MISC Russian  ] population and have them view themselves as [MISC Latvian  ] ( or at least [ORG European Union  ] ) citizens first and [MISC Russians  ] second . 
Political scientist [PER Peteris Vinkelis  ] , himself married to a [MISC Russian  ] , ended a television interview on events in [LOC Georgia  ] with a plea for the two communities to work together and find common ground so as not to become like [LOC Georgia  ] . 
Other senior officials have told us that they would also like to see progress on this front. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) All of those good ideas , though , go out the window the minute politics is injected and there are few issues as politically divisive here as integration of the [MISC Russian  ] speaking population . 
With a crowded political field among the ethnic [MISC Latvian  ] based parties , none of them are willing to risk the firestorm that would ensue from advocating any change to the citizenship process . 
In fact , more likely is that they will take steps to , for example , increase the number of jobs for which certification of [MISC Latvian  ] language skills are required . 
Logical steps on integration , such as [ORG RIGA  ] 00000496 003 OF 003 allowing everyone born in [LOC Latvia  ] automatic citizenship , are rejected because they are what [LOC Moscow  ] has been pushing for years and ethnic [MISC Latvians  ] are unwilling , as they see it , to " reward [LOC Russia  ] 's aggression in [LOC Georgia  ] " by easing the requirements for citizenship . 
Meanwhile , ethnic [MISC Russians  ] are unlikely to respond to events by seeking [MISC Latvian  ] citizenship and some of the more radical elements will hope that [LOC Russia  ] might decide to make acquisition of [MISC Russian  ] citizenship easier for this group. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The challenge for the [LOC United States  ] policy in [LOC Latvia  ] given events in [LOC Georgia  ] is to consider ways that we can bolster our relationship to both assure [MISC Latvians  ] of our continued commitment to their security and helps them develop the tools needed for coping with changed relations with [LOC Russia  ] , including in their domestic situation . 
We will be putting our heads together here and sending in some thoughts in coming days .
