[PER Marechaux  ] said that [LOC France  ] was abiding by the [ORG EU  ] 's strictures against " no new non-humanitarian assistance , " which the [ORG EU  ] was enforcing strictly . 
The [ORG GOF  ] is trying its best not to embroil itself in the dispute over control over [LOC Madagascar  ] 's embassy in [LOC Paris  ] . 
[PER Marechaux  ] labeled [MISC French  ] businessman and behind-the-scenes fixer [PER Robert Bourgi  ] as an opportunist with little experience in [LOC Madagascar  ] , who was asked to involve himself by [MISC Franco-Malgache  ] insider [PER Patrick Lelu  ] ( phonetic ) .
