( C ) Summary and [ORG Introduction: Annual U.S.-Brazil Political-Military  ] consultations , held in [LOC Brasilia  ] , May 14 , reflected general accord on the health of the bilateral pol-mil relationship but identified areas where collaboration and coordination remained thin . 
USdel head P/M Assistant Secretary [PER Lincoln Bloomfield Jr.  ] offered to help close the [ORG SIPDIS  ] gap on outstanding issues , particularly where specific written agreement that would facilitate expanded cooperation was lacking . 
While the [ORG A/S  ] acknowledged that ties between the two militaries were strong , such agreements , he said , would enhance them more . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] officials , led by [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) Director General for [LOC North  ] and [LOC Central America  ] and the [ORG Caribbean  ] Ambassador [PER Washington Pereira  ] , welcomed [LOC U.S.  ] clarification on such matters as [ORG Article  ] 98 , a proposed [ORG Defense Cooperation Agreement  ] , [ORG GSOMIA  ] , and [ORG ACSA  ] , but conceded little in bringing any negotiated agreement closer to closure . 
Looking at the regional situation , the [MISC Brazilian  ] side highlighted bilateral efforts with [LOC Colombia  ] , [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Bolivia  ] , but stopped short of implying a more active political engagement with [LOC Colombia  ] ( unless specifically requested from the [ORG GoC  ] . 
) Focusing on its upcoming peacekeeping mission to [LOC Haiti  ] , the [ORG GOB  ] asked that the [ORG USG  ] assist that country 's post-Aristide political leadership to reach out to pro-Aristide elements and [LOC Caricom  ] . 
Regarding [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG F-X  ] jet fighter competition , [ORG A/S Bloomfield  ] made an indirect pitch for the [MISC Lockheed-Martin F-16  ] by noting continued [MISC AMRAAM  ] availability for the [LOC U.S.  ] package . 
The [ORG F-X  ] decision process , according to the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] , now rests with the Presidency . 
The [ORG GOB  ] side expressed reluctance for any significant change to the mission of regional security instruments such as the [ORG InterAmerican Defense Board  ] and the [ORG OAS Committee  ] on [ORG Hemispheric Security  ] . 
End Summary [ORG DCA  ] & [ORG SOFA  ] ---------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC SBU  ] ) In order to achieve the unmet potential in the current mil-mil relationship , [ORG A/S Bloomfield  ] explained how a defense cooperation framework agreement ( [ORG DCA  ] ) would be a very practical tool for facilitating cooperation in several defense areas such as exchanges , training , and joint exercises . 
He shared with the [ORG GOB  ] a non-paper explaining the purpose of a [ORG DCA  ] as well as a [ORG SOFA  ] , identifying the elements contained in the latter . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] side stated that a [ORG SOFA  ] was necessary for entry into a [ORG DCA  ] . 
The [ORG A/S  ] offered to send [ORG USG  ] experts to explain both types of agreements and , in so doing , to clarify the differences between the two . 
Ambassador [PER Pereira  ] was open to the possibility of a [ORG DCA  ] but remained skeptical that the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Congress  ] would approve a [ORG SOFA  ] because of Constitutional concerns . 
However , he acknowledged that since the [ORG SOFA  ] applied only to discrete groups of [LOC U.S.  ] servicemen , the issue could still be left open for internal [ORG GOB  ] review . 
[ORG Ministry of Defense  ] ( [ORG MOD  ] ) Director for [ORG International Affairs Air Force  ] General [PER Carlos Velloso  ] also welcomed the Assistant Secretary , s suggestion for exploratory talks . 
[PER Velloso  ] noted that discussion of a [ORG SOFA  ] would go beyond the purview of just the [ORG Defense  ] and [ORG Foreign Affairs Ministries  ] , and include the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] among others ; the [ORG A/S  ] replied the same holds true for the [LOC U.S.  ] side , insofar as [LOC Brazil  ] wants to discuss reciprocal treatment . 
[ORG GSOMIA  ] ------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC SBU  ] ) General [PER Velloso  ] indicated that the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] had already begun review of the draft General Security of [ORG Military Information Agreement  ] ( [ORG GSOMIA  ] ) facilitating the exchange of classified military information . 
While the [ORG MOD  ] wanted an agreement , [PER Velloso  ] stated that a number of " restrictions and caveats " have been voiced within the [ORG Ministry  ] about " illegal " [ORG USG  ] requirements ( Note: [PER Velloso  ] subsequently downplayed , then dismissed , the notion of illegal requirements . 
End note ) . 
As a result , the review process within the [ORG Ministry had  ] ground to a halt . 
He promised the [ORG MOD  ] would continue to review the agreement to see what is feasible . 
OSD Senior Country Director for [LOC Brazil  ] Luiz [PER Sanchez  ] replied that over 60 countries , including five in the [LOC Western Hemisphere  ] , had already signed GSOMIAs with the [LOC U.S.  ] In every case , no such " legal " concerns had been voiced by the parties . 
[PER Sanchez  ] said the [ORG USG  ] would appreciate [LOC Brazil  ] , s specific concerns . 
He also offered to arrange a [ORG GSOMIA  ] orientation visit to the [LOC U.S.  ] as a confidence building measure to alleviate [ORG MOD  ] concerns , a proposal welcomed by the [ORG MOD  ] . 
[ORG ACSA  ] ---- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC SBU  ] ) General [PER Velloso  ] recognized the importance of signing an Acquisition and [ORG Cross-Servicing Agreement  ] ( [ORG ACSA  ] ) in support of [LOC Brazil  ] 's upcoming PKO mission to [LOC Haiti  ] . 
However , he pointed to several legislative hurdles that had to be addressed before [LOC Brazil  ] could sign it . 
For example , [MISC Brazilian  ] Law 8666 , he said , did not allow for " cross servicing . 
" According to [PER Velloso  ] , several passages within the [ORG ACSA  ] may need to be deleted or modified . 
Again , [PER Sanchez  ] noted that 47 nations already have ACSAs in place , including six in [LOC South America  ] . 
[PER Sanchez  ] reiterated the rationale for an [ORG ACSA  ] and asked whether the [ORG MOD  ] understood its routine , non-binding nature . 
Again , the [LOC U.S.  ] side requested [LOC Brazil  ] , s specific concerns and suggestions . 
[ORG Article  ] 98 ---------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) [ORG A/S Bloomfield  ] explained that while there is profound feeling behind the [ORG USG  ] rhetoric , [LOC U.S.  ] policy sought neither to undermine the ICC/Rome [ORG Statute  ] nor to be punitive . 
Moreover , the [ORG USG  ] , he pointed out , is not looking to harm its military assistance programs , which serve our interests as well . 
The [MISC American  ] Servicemen 's [ORG Protection Act  ] , however , was a clear effort to use assistance as leverage to dissuade countries from joining the [LOC Rome  ] [ORG Statute  ] , and the [ORG USG  ] would enforce the law . 
Noting that 89 [ORG Article  ] 98 agreements had already been concluded ( over half with countries that have at least signed the [LOC Rome  ] [ORG Statute  ] ) , [ORG Bloomfield  ] said the [ORG USG  ] is comporting with the [LOC Rome  ] [ORG Statute  ] by following the [ORG Article  ] 98 procedure . 
While the [ORG USG  ] recognizes [LOC Brazil  ] , s strong advocacy for accountability and responsibility , the [ORG A/S  ] made clear we do not recognize the [ORG ICC  ] 's jurisdiction over [LOC U.S.  ] citizens . 
Moreover , he emphasized , the threat to [LOC U.S.  ] citizens of politicized prosecution has been shown to be a real world phenomenon. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG MRE United Nations Division Deputy  ] Chief [PER Achiles Zaluar  ] responded that the [ORG MRE  ] was gratified the [MISC Bush  ] administration wanted to avoid a confrontation over [ORG Article  ] 98 . 
The [ORG ICC  ] , [PER Zaluar  ] noted , enjoys considerable public support in [LOC Brazil  ] , and the [ORG GoB  ] believes the Court is an important international institution . 
[LOC Brazil  ] did not want to give the impression international law automatically did not apply to some countries . 
Moreover , [PER Zaluar  ] said , the [ORG U.S. Article  ] 98 model agreement appeared to exempt all [LOC U.S.  ] nationals and not just sent persons . 
" Things would be different if we were talking only about [ORG USG  ] officials and soldiers , " he pointed out , " but a blanket condition for all [LOC U.S.  ] citizens could be detrimental if ( this policy was ) applied by all countries to the [ORG ICC  ] . 
" [LOC Brazil  ] , s extradition stance , he argued , was similar to the [ORG EU  ] , s and the [ORG GoB  ] could offer " additional guarantees " if that would alleviate [ORG USG  ] concerns . 
He stated that [LOC Brazil  ] would extradite to the [LOC United States  ] before the [ORG ICC  ] and urged the [ORG USG  ] in its dealings with [LOC Brazil  ] to think " out-of-the-box . 
" Ambassador [PER Pereira  ] proposed the [ORG GoB  ] continue to study the issue with the clarifications that the UGS provided . 
Intelligence Sharing / " 3 1 " [ORG TBA Cooperation  ] ------------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG MRE Illicit Transitional Crime Division  ] Chief [PER Marcos Pinta Gama  ] shared [ORG USG  ] optimism about bilateral intelligence and law enforcement cooperation , pointing out that [MISC Brazilian  ] agencies benefit greatly from cooperation with counterpart [ORG USG  ] agencies . 
He cited extensive information exchange on crime , drugs and anti-terrorism and specifically praised the bilateral , [MISC Embassy-led  ] Law [ORG Enforcement Working Group  ] ( [ORG LEWG  ] ) , established in 2003 . 
[ORG Pinta Gama  ] did refer to a [ORG State Department  ] website citing " financial support " from the [ORG TBA  ] for terrorist groups and asked that such a determination be " better established . 
" He described the " 3 1 " mechanism as instrumental in showing the reality in the [ORG TBA  ] and the challenges faced there . 
[ORG Pinta Gama  ] also suggested that [LOC Chile  ] and [LOC Uruguay  ] be added to the " 3 1 " Group . 
[ORG MRE  ] 's crime chief felt that additional bilateral cooperation and more fluid threat information exchange could be achieved between [MISC Brazilian  ] civil aviation authorities and the [ORG TSA  ] , particularly in the absence of armed air marshals in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[ORG Regional Challenges  ] ------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) MRE [LOC South America  ] Division Chief [PER Rubem Barbosa  ] provided an overview of the state of [LOC Brazil  ] , s neighbors , and [ORG Pinta Gama  ] reviewed [LOC Brazil  ] , s border monitoring coordination efforts with its [MISC Andean  ] neighbors . 
Regarding [LOC Colombia  ] , the [ORG GoB  ] remained concerned with possible spillover effects . 
To improve tactical cooperation , Presidents [PER Uribe  ] and [PER Lula  ] established a bilateral working group to exploit the information gleaned from [ORG SIVAM  ] , now completely operational . 
[ORG Pinta Gama  ] praised the work of the [ORG Regional Intelligence Center  ] in [LOC Tabatinga  ] which monitors the flow of drugs along the [MISC Colombian  ] border . 
[LOC Brazil  ] , [PER Barbosa  ] stated , perceived significant political progress under [PER Uribe  ] and remained " moderately optimistic " about that country 's prospects . 
He reiterated [LOC Brazil  ] , s offer to host a meeting between the [ORG UN  ] and the insurgents , if the [ORG GoC  ] concurred . 
[ORG A/S Bloomfield  ] asked how [LOC Brazil  ] could play an even more constructive role in [LOC Colombia  ] . 
[PER Barbosa  ] emphasized the [ORG GoB  ] would not " impose its views " on the [MISC Colombian  ] people . 
[LOC Brazil  ] would lend more active participation , he said , if it were welcomed by the [MISC Colombians  ] themselves . 
[LOC Brazil  ] wanted a clear signal or indication for its broader involvement and would only act if [LOC Bogota  ] specifically requested its assistance. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [LOC Brazil  ] shares its longest and most porous border with [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
Ambassador [PER Pereira  ] said the [ORG GoB  ] viewed with " grave concern " the " seismic changes " occurring in [LOC Bolivia  ] , including the disturbing convergence of an energized indigenous movement with the drug problem . 
[PER Pereira  ] underscored the [LOC Brazil  ] 's unshaken support for President [LOC Mesa  ] and President [PER Lula  ] , s efforts to keep [PER Morales  ] on a democratic path . 
[LOC Brazil  ] , he said , was also doing everything it could to prevent [LOC Bolivia  ] , s economic collapse and warned that " moderation " had to continue . 
[PER Barbosa  ] explained that [LOC Brazil  ] continued to work with [LOC Venezuela  ] on a wide range of issues including trafficking-in-persons and cross border drug trafficking . 
However , [LOC Venezuela  ] must respect democratic principles and move towards a democratic solution -- a stance the [PER Lula  ] administration continued to demand of [PER Chavez  ] . 
[PER Barbosa  ] opined that [PER Lula  ] , s close ties with [PER Chavez  ] helps to " moderate " the [MISC Venezuelan  ] leader . 
PKO/HAITI --------- 1 <a id='par0' href='#par0'>¶</a>0 . 
( C ) [PER Zaluar  ] announced that the bill authorizing [LOC Brazil  ] 's participation in the [LOC Haiti  ] peacekeeping operation had just passed the [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] , adding that President [PER Lula  ] personally had been involved in the process . 
( Note: The bill passed the [ORG Senate  ] on May 19 . 
End note ) [LOC Brazil  ] , he explained , wanted [LOC Haiti  ] , s underlying social and development issues to be addressed during this [ORG UN  ] operation , and the international community , and especially the [LOC U.S.  ] , should provide generous financial support . 
The [ORG MRE  ] believed that [MISC Haitians  ] had turned to drug trafficking only when there was no other viable economic alternative after international assistance was cut off . 
Pointing to continued repercussions from President [PER Aristide  ] 's departure from power , [PER Zaluar  ] urged the [LOC U.S.  ] to press [LOC Haiti  ] 's current leadership to reach out to [ORG Caricom  ] and the pro-Aristide forces . 
[ORG Caricom  ] support , he felt , was vital to a political solution and so far , the new leaders seemed not to have a good understanding of the regional context of the [LOC Haiti  ] situation . 
[ORG A/S Bloomfield  ] expressed [ORG USG  ] appreciation for [LOC Brazil  ] 's decision to lead in this important hemispheric operation , and the [LOC United States  ] understood the need for the country 's economic and social development . 
He said he would carry the message regarding the behavior towards pro-Aristide elements and [ORG Caricom  ] back to [LOC Washington  ] . 
[ORG Defense Modernization Programs  ] ------------------------------ 11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) One of [LOC Brazil  ] 's most important military modernization efforts is the new generation [MISC F-X  ] fighter program . 
General [PER Velloso  ] indicated that the long-running [MISC F-X  ] competition process had progressed from the [ORG Air Force  ] through the MOD to the [LOC Presidency  ] where a decision on the selection of the [MISC F-X  ] had not yet been made . 
The [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] remained closely engaged with the [LOC Presidency  ] , the General assured , and its technical imput on the fighter options was being weighed carefully . 
[ORG A/S Bloomfield  ] emphasized that the [ORG USAF  ] 's principal interest is not commercial but rather to sustain a close , long-term relationship with the [ORG Brazilian Air Force  ] , which is held in high regard among the [LOC US  ] military . 
Regarding authorization to release the [ORG AMRAAM  ] missile as a part of the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC F-16  ] package , the [ORG USG  ] had confronted and overcome old attitudes in the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Congress  ] because " the partnership with [LOC Brazil  ] was a greater interest even than our regional proliferation concerns . 
" [ORG Amazon Surveillance System  ] ( [ORG SIVAM  ] ) Commission Vice President [ORG Air Force  ] General [PER Alvaro Pinheiro  ] stated that with the opening of the [LOC Manaus  ] command center , [ORG SIVAM  ] was " completely operational . 
" He cited continuing spare parts issues with [ORG Raytheon  ] , although he conceded there were no more " technical problems . 
" [MISC Southcom J-5  ] [ORG Brazil Desk  ] Officer [PER LTC Sam Prugh  ] indicated that the [ORG USG  ] supported greater regional sharing of radar data to develop a complete , seamless picture that would better protect [LOC Brazil  ] 's borders . 
[ORG Special Conference  ] on [ORG Hemispheric Security  ] ------------------------------------------ <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG MRE  ] [ORG OAS Division  ] Chief [PER Nelson Tabajara  ] praised the successful outcome of the [ORG Special Conference  ] , including the [ORG Declaration on Security  ] in the [ORG Americas  ] ( [ORG DSA  ] ) . 
He described the [ORG DSA  ] as evidence of the historical evolution of hemispheric security issues within the [ORG OAS  ] . 
To reach consensus on such a significant document , a lengthy preparatory process was indeed necessary . 
In [LOC Brazil  ] , s opinion , the [ORG DSA  ] correctly emphasizes threats beyond simply traditional territorial confrontations . 
[PER Tabajara  ] concluded by asserting that the [ORG Declaration  ] serves as both a guide and a starting point because future work , including perhaps additional conferences , will be needed to bolster hemispheric security . 
[PER Eli Sugarman  ] from the [ORG Office of Regional and Strategic Security  ] , [ORG Bureau of Arms Control  ] , echoed [LOC Brazil  ] , s position and emphasized the need to move forward with implementation of the [ORG DSA  ] . 
[PER Sugarman  ] also agreed that continued consultations are needed to discuss concrete ways to implement the more action oriented provisions of the [ORG DSA  ] . 
Confidence and [ORG Security Building Measures  ] ( [ORG CSBMs  ] ) --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Sugarman  ] stated that one of the most significant outcomes of the [ORG Special Conference  ] on Security was the creation of a permanent [ORG OAS  ] " Forum for Confidence and [ORG Security Building  ] " to consider new measures and review implementation of past ones . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] hopes to use this Forum to consider a " new generation " of [ORG CSBMs  ] to address emerging transnational threats of the 21st century . 
[PER Tabajara  ] agreed that the pursuit of a new generation of non-military measures is important . 
Since original measures have succeeded in considerably lowering mistrust , he felt a new generation of measures could continue this momentum and further promote stability and military transparency in the hemisphere . 
[ORG OAS Committee  ] on [ORG Hemispheric Security  ] ( [ORG CHS  ] ) , General Assembly Resolutions -------------------------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Tabajara  ] affirmed that [LOC Brazil  ] was satisfied with the work of the [ORG CHS  ] , and he highlighted [LOC Brazil  ] , s recent draft resolution on combating extreme poverty as a security concern for [LOC Brazil  ] and others . 
[PER Sugarman  ] stressed the need for a more effective [ORG CHS  ] Chair next year to ensure that the [ORG CHS  ] is able to fulfill its numerous mandates , including those related to [ORG Special Conference  ] follow-up . 
The process of introducing resolutions also ought to be reconsidered , he added . 
For example , although the [LOC U.S.  ] supports [LOC Brazil  ] 's resolution on extreme poverty , we were caught by surprise when it was introduced at the last minute without prior consultation . 
[PER Sugarman  ] , s reference to a [MISC U.S.-drafted  ] resolution on [ORG Man-Portable Air Defense Systems  ] ( [ORG MANPADS  ] ) surprised the [MISC Brazilians  ] because they were unaware that such a draft resolution was being considered . 
[PER Sugarman  ] explained that further consultations were needed before the draft would be formally introduced . 
He concluded by suggesting a series of regular ( quarterly ) consultations between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG OAS  ] delegations to ensure better coordination on hemispheric security issues . 
[ORG Inter-American Defense Board Modernization  ] ------------------------------------------ <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Inter-American Defense Board  ] ( [ORG IADB  ] ) , [ORG A/S Bloomfield  ] stated , should be part of a new array of effective and relevant regional security institutions , and the [LOC U.S.  ] favors a range of proposals to modernize it . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] military , he noted , is increasingly called to perform nontraditional tasks , such as providing advice to outgunned police forces faced with heavily-armed organized crime elements . 
Yet , the [ORG OAS  ] lacked the expertise to assist in large measure because it cannot call upon the [ORG IADB  ] for help . 
The [ORG USG  ] recognizes , however , that making changes to the [ORG IADB  ] is a consensus matter for its members . 
Among the proposed reforms , the [ORG A/S  ] pointed to a proposal to divide the [ORG Board  ] into subunits for hemispheric security responsibilities and for traditional defense. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG MRE  ] [ORG OAS Division  ] Chief [PER Nelson Tabajara  ] responded that while the [LOC GoB  ] also supports the [ORG IADB  ] , it is skeptical about the benefits of reforming the [ORG Board  ] . 
While sympathetic to [ORG USG  ] concerns , the [LOC GoB  ] , believes the [ORG IADB  ] serves a unique role in the region by providing a forum to discuss traditional military tasks and its mission should not be " diluted . 
" New threats where there are no single paradigms or solutions , should be accommodated through " new mechanisms and assets...on a case by case basis " depending upon the threat , [PER Tabajara  ] explained . 
The [ORG A/S  ] acknowledged that the two countries differ on their perceptions how to utilize the [ORG IADB  ] . 
MOD Vice-Admiral [PER Murillo Barbosa  ] acknowledged the increase in non-traditional tasks undertaken by the [MISC Brazilian  ] military , including [ORG Amazon  ] development , counterdrug operations , and assistance to the [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] police . 
However , he seconded [PER Tabajara  ] , s point about preserving the [ORG IADB  ] as a forum for defense issues focusing on " traditional " threats . 
Comment ------- 17 . 
( C ) While the upcoming [LOC Haiti  ] [ORG PKO  ] was the principal issue on the minds of [MISC Brazilian  ] interlocutors during the talks , within the [MISC Brazilian  ] delegation there appeared to be a disconnect between the [ORG PKO  ] mission and the need for various agreements , such as a [ORG GSOMIA  ] and an [ORG ACSA  ] , to be in place to assure the mission 's effectiveness and success . 
We believe our message may have sunk in . 
Subsequently , we have learned that the [ORG MRE  ] has approached various diplomatic missions in [LOC Brasilia  ] , inquiring about their governments' respective agreements with us . 
As [MISC Brazilian  ] peacekeepers arrive in [LOC Haiti  ] , we may see movement on these agreements . 
Finally , while the [MISC Brazilians  ] no doubt came away with a better understanding of issues of major importance to us , such as [ORG Article  ] 98 , they conceded little except their stated intention to continue reviewing these topics. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( U ) Assistant Secretary [ORG Bloomfield  ] has cleared this message .
