[LOC PARIS  ] 7425 [ORG Classified By: Political Minister  ] Counselor [PER Josiah Rosenblatt  ] for [MISC Reaso  ] ns 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) SUBJECT: GOF C/T COORDINATOR , S OVERVIEW OF TERRORISM THREAT <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) Summary: [PER Christophe Chaboud  ] , the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] 's counter-terrorism coordinating chief , told us on November 20 that GOF authorities remain extremely concerned about the threat of terrorism on [MISC French  ] soil and are actively taking measures to combat current and future threats . 
Radical [MISC Islamists  ] are still the principal threat to [MISC French  ] interests at home and abroad . 
[PER Chaboud  ] reported that the 2003-2004 uptick in fighters from [LOC France  ] to [LOC Iraq  ] appears to have lost momentum , and that there are no signs that the [ORG GSPC  ] is actively targeting [LOC France  ] . 
The C/T chief also reviewed improvements to airport security , as well as [ORG ETA  ] and PKK activities . 
End Summary . 
RADICAL [MISC ISLAMIC  ] THREAT <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) On November 20 , poloff met for an introductory call with [PER Christophe Chaboud  ] , the head of [LOC France  ] 's C/T coordination unit , or UCLAT . 
( Note: UCLAT is the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] 's nexus for all counter-terrorism operations , analysis , and exchanges . 
) [PER Chaboud  ] set the tone for the discussion by quickly establishing that radical [MISC Islamists  ] remained the principal threat to [LOC France  ] and [MISC French  ] interests around the world , particularly in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
While intelligence analysis suggested there were no active known networks operating in [LOC France  ] , [PER Chaboud  ] said the [ORG GOF  ] was taking aggressive preventative measures to ensure that authorities are not caught off guard . 
[ORG GSPC  ] , s announcement of its joining with [ORG al-Qaeda  ] and highlighting [LOC France  ] as its number one enemy , was extremely worrisome , however , [MISC French  ] intelligence officials had not noted any signs of increasing activity . 
[MISC FRENCH  ] JIHADISTS ---------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) There were now " very few " known cases of [MISC French  ] nationals going to [LOC Iraq  ] , according to [PER Chaboud  ] . 
In 2003-2005 , the [ORG GOF  ] intelligence community was deeply concerned about the radicalization of young [MISC French  ] Muslims to the point that some joined the jihad in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] , he said . 
The trend appears to have faded since then . 
Aside from the recent October 20 arrests of three [MISC French  ] nationals in [LOC Damascus  ] ( see ref A ) , [PER Chaboud  ] said , [MISC French  ] officials were not aware of any other recent cases . 
He praised [MISC Syrian  ] officials for their efficiency in arresting the young [MISC French  ] men , who were apparently taken into custody after only a few days in [LOC Syria  ] , and credited intense [LOC U.S.  ] pressure as motivation for the [MISC Syrians'  ] haste . 
[PER Chaboud  ] added that , for the moment , there was no evidence that any of the three men had connections to previously known networks in [LOC France  ] ; more likely , they had found their path to [LOC Iraq  ] through very informal channels . 
Asked about the reason for the downturn in numbers going to [LOC Iraq  ] , [PER Chaboud  ] said he believed that harsh punishment from [MISC French  ] authorities , the deaths of their " brothers " in [LOC Iraq  ] , and a local lack of support among most [MISC French  ] Muslims , must certainly have had an effect . 
( Note: Two of the three [MISC French  ] nationals were reportedly expelled to [LOC France  ] on November 22 , and despite a lack of notification by [MISC Syrian  ] authorities , were arrested after landing in [LOC France  ] . 
) PREVENTION: IMAM EXPULSIONS --------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) [PER Chaboud  ] proudly touted the expulsion of 54 imams from [LOC France  ] since 2001 . 
The imams were expelled from [LOC France  ] for allegedly preaching radical [MISC Islamic  ] ideas . 
( Note: In at least one highly publicized case , an expelled imam told local media that the [MISC Koran  ] sanctioned the submission of women through force . 
) [PER Chaboud  ] noted that while the majority of expelled imams were [MISC Algerian  ] , a handful came from [LOC Turkey  ] , [LOC Morocco  ] , [LOC Tunisia  ] and " one or two [LOC Gulf  ] countries . 
" He added that [LOC France  ] was far ahead of other [ORG EU  ] states , in particular the [LOC UK  ] , in taking necessary action against foreign nationals who advocated " radical ideologies . 
" Another 12 imams are reportedly awaiting deportation . 
PREVENTION: AIRPORT SECURITY ---------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) When asked about the current , very public , controversy ( see ref B ) surrounding the suspension of security clearances of 72 [MISC Muslim  ] workers at [LOC Paris  ] , [PER Charles de Gaulle  ] airport , [PER Chaboud  ] confirmed this had occurred chiefly on UCLAT 's recommendation . 
Since the 2005 [LOC London  ] bombings , he said , there clearly has been a need to focus on security in sensitive locations . 
Given CDG 's stature in the world , and its past as an origination point for the December 2001 " shoe bomber , " [PER Chaboud  ] stressed that dramatic steps had to be taken to avoid future attacks . 
" I asked myself , what I would do if I was a terrorist ; how I would get past airport security , " [PER Chaboud  ] said . 
The answer was simple , he replied -- to clearly identify and exploit airport employees who might be sympathetic to the " cause . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) After more than a year of investigation , UCLAT had concluded that at least 72 workers were vulnerable to exploitation because of their deep , and at least somewhat radical , religious convictions , [PER Chaboud  ] stated . 
He added that while they were not themselves terrorists , they appeared to be extreme enough in their comportment outside of work to lead authorities to conclude that they might aid or abet terrorists . 
[PER Chaboud  ] readily admitted that [ORG GOF  ] authorities were creating new territory and that the judiciary had its own role to play , but he onetheless adamantly defended the recommendations that led to the revocation of security clearances . 
( Note: In the cases of 11 of the 72 employees who have filed legal grievances , the local [MISC Prefet  ] voluntarily gave back security clearances to two individuals . 
A separate judgement has demanded that two others also be reinstated ) . 
[ORG ETA  ] STEPS UP ACTIVITY IN [LOC FRANCE  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) [ORG ETA  ] , [PER Chaboud  ] said , appears to have become more active in [LOC France  ] over the past several months . 
He repeated the standard [MISC French  ] policy line that [ORG ETA  ] is a [MISC Spanish  ] domestic issue and not a political question for [LOC France  ] . 
That said , he noted that there was intense operational dialogue between [LOC France  ] and [LOC Spain  ] about cross-border activity . 
[PER Chaboud  ] said he was convinced that [ORG ETA  ] is using the time for negotiating a political truce to replenish its stockpile of weapons , vehicles , and false travel documents . 
" I have warned the [MISC Spanish  ] , " [PER Chaboud  ] stressed , and said he would continue to advise them about developments in the [MISC French  ] [LOC Basque country  ] . 
( Note: Recent press reports speculate that in addition to the rise in stolen property , [ORG ETA  ] wishes to directly involve [LOC Paris  ] in the negotiations , something the [MISC French  ] refuse outright . 
) PKK: " THEY KNOW NOT TO GO TOO FAR " ---------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) [PER Chaboud  ] said that [ORG PKK  ] members in [LOC France  ] knew the [ORG GOF  ] was prepared to act if they " go too far . 
" [LOC France  ] certainly did not want to provoke the [ORG PKK  ] , which has never attacked [LOC France  ] or [MISC French  ] interests , but had made clear that certain activities would not be allowed on [MISC French  ] soil . 
He added that the [ORG GOF  ] had taken some steps in the past year to break-up money laundering operations by [ORG PKK  ] members . 
It was a message he insisted the [ORG PKK  ] understands . 
" [LOC France  ] is not an important country for the [ORG PKK  ] ; [LOC Germany  ] is . 
We do not have the kind of [ORG PKK  ] members they have there ; we have the intellectuals ; it is our tradition , " [PER Chaboud  ] said . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) [PER Chaboud  ] expressed confidence that [LOC France  ] was taking appropriate measures in the fight against terrorism , adding that legislation passed in 2006 had gone a long way to codify current practices and pave the way for increased electronic surveillance . 
He noted that cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [ORG G-6  ] was excellent , but indicated there was still a great deal of work to be done with intelligence officials in the [LOC Maghreb  ] .
