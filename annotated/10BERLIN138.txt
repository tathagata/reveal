MURPHY  ] . 
REASONS: 1.4 ( B ) AND ( D ) . 
Dear Madam Secretary , ( SBU ) I have just returned from a five-day trip to northern [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Kabul  ] at the invitation of the [MISC German  ] Armed Forces and wanted to share with you some of my impressions . 
( C ) First and foremost , I came away deeply impressed with the dedication , professionalism and competence of the [MISC German  ] soldiers I met in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Without exception , all of them strongly believe in [LOC GEN McChrystal  ] 's counterinsurgency strategy and see its emphasis on protection of the population and partnering with [MISC Afghan  ] security forces as absolutely the right way ahead . 
While the [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC German  ] militaries might have had their differences in the past about the right strategy in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , that is no longer the case today . 
( C ) The [MISC Bundeswehr  ] will probably never be able to do partnering at the ratio and intensity that [LOC U.S.  ] forces do , but as the [MISC German  ] commander for [LOC Region North  ] assured me , it is ready to deploy beefed-up embedded mentoring teams to operate in the field with the [MISC Afghan National Army  ] ( [ORG ANA  ] ) . 
The [MISC Bundeswehr  ] has made great strides over the past couple of years , eliminating many of its previous caveats and becoming more offensively-minded . 
Its command of the quick reaction force ( [ORG QRF  ] ) for the northern region -- a unit which I had the pleasure of inspecting during my trip -- has helped facilitate this process . 
The current [MISC Bundeswehr  ] is a far cry from the static , defensively oriented territorial army of 20 years ago . 
( C ) Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] 's January 26 announcement that she would seek only a 500-troop increase in the [MISC German  ] contingent ( along with an additional 350-troop reserve ) was disappointing . 
The decision to go with a much lower number ( [ORG Defense Minster  ] zu [PER Guttenberg  ] had recommended an increase of 1,500 troops ) was driven by the Chancellor 's desire to maintain broad parliamentary support for the [ORG ISAF  ] mandate in the face of overwhelming public opposition to the deployment . 
However , we should not write off the [MISC Germans  ] as a military contributor and assume they can only contribute to the new [ORG ISAF  ] strategy by providing garrison trainers . 
We will hold them to their commitment to restructure their forces so that the number of [MISC Bundeswehr  ] soldiers training and operating with the [ORG ANA  ] in the field will increase from the current 280 to 1,400 . 
The [LOC Afghanistan  ] deployment has been a transformational process for the [MISC Bundeswehr  ] and we should encourage the continuation of this positive trend . 
While recognizing the [MISC Germans'  ] perceptions of their limitations , we must also be careful not to go too far in the other direction and have overly low expectations of them . 
( C ) During my talks to [MISC German  ] soldiers of all ranks , I was struck by their frustration about the unwillingness of [MISC German  ] politicians to be honest about the nature of the [MISC German  ] military engagement in northern [LOC Afghanistan  ] -- i.e. , that it does not involve just guarding aid workers and digging wells , but also combat against hard-core insurgents . 
They complained that while the [MISC Bundeswehr  ] and the [LOC Afghanistan  ] deployment had evolved over time , the politicians remained stuck in an old mind-set that sees the [MISC German  ] public as simply incapable of accepting [MISC German  ] soldiers being involved in anything but purely defensive military operations . 
They thought that support for the mission would actually increase if the [MISC German  ] government were more open and honest about what was really going on and what was at stake . 
They pointed out that while [MISC German  ] public opposition to the deployment is high ( 60-70% favor immediate withdrawal ) , it is not deeply felt , with other issues like the economy and unemployment ranking much higher on the list of concerns . 
( C ) My own assessment is that the [MISC German  ] public is much more resilient on this issue than the politicians give them credit for . 
Who would have imagined in 2001 that [LOC Germany  ] would still be in [LOC Afghanistan  ] eight years later despite the loss of 35 soldiers and police officers ? 
Many would have predicted that a tragedy like last fall 's [MISC German-ordered  ] air strike in [LOC Kunduz  ] , in which dozens of innocent [MISC Afghan  ] civilians may have been killed , would have led to angry demonstrations in [LOC Germany  ] , demanding immediate withdrawal of the [MISC Bundeswehr  ] . 
But in fact , the opposite occurred . 
Support for the mission [LOC BERLIN  ] 00000138 002 OF 002 actually increased temporarily as most [MISC Germans  ] rallied around the [MISC German  ] commander who took the difficult decision to order the bombing against the two hijacked fuel tankers . 
While we obviously must defer to the [MISC German  ] government on how to handle these issues domestically , we should not take at face value traditional [MISC German  ] assertions about the impossibility of [MISC Bundeswehr  ] involvement in military operations . 
( C ) I was equally impressed with the [MISC German  ] civilian police trainers that I met at the [MISC German  ] police training facility in [LOC Mazar-e Sharif  ] , which is being expanded to train up to 600 police at a time . 
They are extremely competent and committed . 
The good news is that the old debate between [LOC Germany  ] and the [LOC United States  ] about how to train police is over . 
[LOC Germany  ] has embraced the [LOC U.S.  ] Focused [ORG District Development  ] ( [ORG FDD  ] ) police training program and has plans to implement it in 50 districts throughout the north by 2012 . 
Part of [PER Merkel  ] 's January 26 announcement included a planned increase in civilian police trainers from 123 to 200 for [ORG FDD  ] and other bilateral training programs . 
Unlike military deployments , sending police trainers requires no parliamentary mandate and is not politically controversial . 
( C ) The less good news is that while [MISC German  ] police mentoring teams ( PMTs ) also include military police , [LOC Germany  ] views police training overall as a purely civilian government activity that can only be done by active-duty police officers . 
As a result , [MISC German  ] PMTs cannot include contractors , operate in conflict areas or partner with [MISC Afghan  ] police in doing operations beyond normal law enforcement . 
The further [MISC German  ] PMTs move away from [MISC German  ] bases , the higher the requirements will be for [MISC Bundeswehr  ] force protection and medical support , which is already in short supply . 
[LOC Merkel  ] touts that [LOC Germany  ] will train 5,000 [MISC Afghan  ] police per year , but most of that will be garrison training , not the mentoring and partnering that GEN McChrystal believes is critical to getting [MISC Afghan  ] security forces up to speed quickly . 
Even for garrison training , [LOC Germany  ] 's ability to send significantly more police officers is limited because there is no excess capacity within either the [ORG Federal Police  ] or the 16 state police forces to draw from . 
The program depends on volunteers who agree to serve even though in most cases it is not career-enhancing . 
We continue to push here in [LOC Berlin  ] for the government to find some way to deploy more police trainers , but this is likely to be a lengthy process . 
( C ) All the [MISC German  ] military leaders and officials I met with welcomed the planned deployment of a brigade of [LOC U.S.  ] police trainers and a battalion of air assets in the north of [LOC Afghanistan  ] , realizing that both are urgently needed to fill long-standing shortfalls . 
The fact that the [LOC U.S.  ] forces will come under the tactical control of the [MISC German  ] regional commander has reassured the [MISC Germans  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] has no intention of taking over the north . 
As we go forward , we will want to make sure that all of our actions in the north are fully coordinated so that we do not inadvertently undermine [LOC Germany  ] 's sense of ownership of the region . 
This is essential for keeping [LOC Germany  ] fully engaged in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and the [MISC Bundeswehr  ] on its positive trajectory to becoming a fully capable , expeditionary force . 
( C ) Over the next several weeks , in the lead-up to the [ORG Bundestag  ] debate and vote on the government 's proposal for a troop increase , I will be engaging with government ministers , parliamentarians from all parties and the media to relay the conclusions of my trip and to underscore the importance of [LOC Germany  ] stepping up its efforts on the training of [MISC Afghan  ] national security forces . 
As I saw for myself in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , there is a compelling case for the [LOC U.S.  ] strategy and approach and I am confident that , in the end , we will be able to get a strong and meaningful increase in [LOC Germany  ] 's contribution to our common mission .
