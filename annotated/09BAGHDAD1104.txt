[LOC BAGHDAD  ] 289 Classified By: Classified By: Charge d'Affaires [PER Patricia A. Butenis  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) SUMMARY: The [MISC Iranian  ] response to the drawdown of [LOC U.S.  ] military forces in [LOC Iraq  ] , and [LOC Iraq  ] 's evolving relationship with [LOC Iran  ] , will influence the climate for [LOC U.S.  ] engagement with [LOC Iran  ] on our range of interests . 
The [MISC Iranians  ] may see the drawdown as an opportunity to strengthen their hand in [LOC Iraq  ] , akin to the opportunities they perceived after the fall of [ORG Saddam  ] in 2003 . 
But they appear to have learned that their proxy violence and efforts to strong-arm [MISC Iraqi  ] politicians generated more ill-will than influence . 
[MISC Iraqis  ] are now pushing back against malign [MISC Iranian  ] influence . 
The [ORG GOI  ] cracked down on [MISC Iranian-backed  ] militias and signed long-term partnership agreements with the [LOC United States  ] last year , while this year [MISC Iraqi  ] voters rewarded nationalist [MISC Iraqi  ] politicians in the provincial elections . 
At the same time , [MISC Iraqis  ] are buying [MISC Iranian  ] products , accepting [MISC Iranian  ] investments , and welcoming [MISC Iranian  ] visitors . 
The political relationship between the countries is maturing , although still scratchy. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) ( Summary continued ) [LOC Iran  ] in 2009 faces more constraints in [LOC Iraq  ] than it did in 2003 . 
We expect the [MISC Iranians  ] will respond to the [LOC U.S.  ] military drawdown under these new constraints with violence targeted more closely at the [LOC United States  ] , more diplomatic outreach to [MISC Iraqi  ] politicians , and continued focus on trade and investment . 
Consistent with ref A , our response must be targeted as well: a vigorous response to security challenges , regional diplomacy to help [LOC Iraq  ] integrate with its neighbors and internationally , and increased assistance to [LOC Iraq  ] to build its political and economic capacity to resist malign influence from [LOC Iran  ] . 
END SUMMARY. --------------- New environment --------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG Quds Force  ] ( [ORG QF  ] ) -- the external operations arm of the [ORG Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps  ] ( [ORG IRGC  ] ) -- has directed [MISC Iranian  ] policy in [LOC Iraq  ] since the fall of [ORG Saddam  ] in 2003 . 
The [MISC IRGC-QF  ] used its leverage with [MISC Shi'a  ] political parties such as the [ORG Supreme Council  ] for the [MISC Islamic  ] Revolution in [LOC Iraq  ] ( [ORG SCIRI  ] ) to influence evolving [MISC Iraqi  ] domestic politics , while providing extensive logistical support and training to the [MISC Jaysh  ] al-Mahdi ( [ORG JAM  ] ) militia and other extremist groups . 
Tripartite discussions between the [ORG USG  ] , [ORG GOI  ] , and [MISC Iranian  ] government in [LOC Baghdad  ] in 2007 made no immediate breakthroughs toward reducing [MISC Iranian  ] sponsorship of violence. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The heavy-handed [MISC Iranian  ] intervention backfired , however , when the violent and undisciplined [ORG JAM  ] alienated many [MISC Iraqis  ] , who also came to resent [MISC Iranian  ] political interference . 
In 2007 , [ORG SCIRI  ] changed its name to the [ORG Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq  ] ( [ORG ISCI  ] ) to distance itself from its [MISC Iranian  ] and revolutionary origins , while PM [PER Maliki  ] 's [ORG Da'wa  ] party has staked out a nationalist political position . 
With [ORG ISCI  ] 's backing , [PER Maliki  ] directed [MISC Iraqi  ] security forces to challenge [ORG JAM  ] control of [LOC Basra  ] and [LOC Sadr City  ] in 2008 , succeeding with the extensive but quiet assistance of [LOC MNF-I  ] . 
This success , along with growing popular distrust of [LOC Iran  ] and [MISC Iranian  ] influence , contributed to [ORG Da'wa  ] 's strong showing over [ORG ISCI  ] in January 2009 provincial elections ( ref B ) . 
Among other recent [MISC Iranian  ] setbacks in [LOC Iraq  ] , the [ORG GOI  ] signed the Qother recent [MISC Iranian  ] setbacks in [LOC Iraq  ] , the [ORG GOI  ] signed the [ORG Security Agreement  ] and [ORG Strategic Framework Agreement  ] with the [ORG USG  ] despite [MISC Iranian  ] objections. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Dynamics other than the [LOC U.S.  ] military drawdown will affect [MISC Iranian  ] influence in [LOC Iraq  ] in coming years . 
[MISC Iraqis  ] will continue to accept legitimate [MISC Iranian  ] investment and buy [MISC Iranian  ] electricity and manufactured goods as [MISC Iraqi  ] domestic production struggles to rebuild . 
[MISC Iranian  ] agricultural produce will continue to fill [MISC Iraqi  ] markets as [MISC Iraqi  ] farmers recover from conflict , neglect , and a drought that has limited production . 
The number of [MISC Iranian  ] pilgrims and tourists , already in the hundreds of thousands annually , will increase with improvements in [MISC Iraqi  ] security and tourism infrastructure . 
As the [MISC Iraqi-Iranian  ] bilateral relationship matures with its positive advances and disputes , the [LOC BAGHDAD  ] 00001104 002 OF 003 governments will seek to deepen their cooperation on issues such as de-mining , petroleum development and border security , although disagreements over border demarcation and water rights will continue to cause friction ( ref G ) . <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Just as [LOC Iraq  ] will try to strengthen relations with its [MISC Arab  ] neighbors and [LOC Turkey  ] to balance [MISC Iranian  ] influence , [LOC Iran  ] will maintain regional influence through relations with [LOC Syria  ] and domestic influence in [LOC Iraq  ] through its TV broadcasts into [LOC Iraq  ] and relations with [LOC Shia  ] political parties , the [MISC Kurds  ] , and in fact any [MISC Iraqis  ] who will have them . 
Ultimately , [MISC Iraqi  ] nationalism and self-reliance are the most effective long-term defenses against [MISC Iranian  ] domination , and the degree and nature of [MISC Iranian  ] influence in [LOC Iraq  ] will be determined less by the level of [LOC U.S.  ] military forces in [LOC Iraq  ] than by the [MISC Iraqi  ] political and economic capacity to balance [MISC Iranian  ] influence and channel it into mutually beneficial areas. -------- Drawdown -------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S/NF ) While it initially criticized the [ORG Security Agreement  ] , intelligence reporting indicates that [LOC Iran  ] is beginning to take advantage of the new constraints on [LOC U.S.  ] military forces . 
[MISC Iranian  ] officials have pressured the [ORG GOI  ] to close the [ORG Mujahedin-e Khalq  ] 's [LOC Camp Ashraf  ] since the [ORG GOI  ] assumed security responsibility for it on January 1 , as well as release [MISC IRGC-QF  ] officers detained by [PER MNF-I  ] in January 2007 as [PER MNF-I  ] turns detainees over to the [ORG GOI  ] . 
( Note: [MISC MNF-I  ] and Embassy intend to hold the officers as long as legally possible . 
End note . 
) Even as [LOC Iran  ] publicly emphasizes diplomatic and economic engagement in [LOC Iraq  ] ( ref C ) , the [MISC IRGC-QF  ] continues to support violent extremist groups such as [PER Kata'ib Hizbollah  ] ( [ORG KH  ] ) , and [LOC Iran  ] may have played a role in the recent movement of the extremist group [PER Asa'ib Ahl  ] al-Haqq ( [ORG AAH  ] ) away from the political reconciliation process . 
[MISC MNF-I  ] analysts expect extremists to continue to use increasingly deadly weapons supplied by [LOC Iran  ] against [LOC U.S.  ] forces this year as [LOC U.S.  ] forces move outside the cities and present targets with little risk of collateral damage . 
[MISC MNF-I  ] also expects extremists to respond to the drawdown with attacks on [LOC U.S.  ] forces in an attempt to take credit for the [LOC U.S.  ] departure. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Likewise , the [MISC Iranian  ] government will continue to publicly portray the drawdown as a victory for the [MISC Iraqi  ] people and defeat for the [LOC United States  ] , perhaps placing it in the context of other [LOC U.S.  ] military disengagements such as [LOC Lebanon  ] in 1984 and [LOC Somalia  ] in 1993 . 
After the [ORG Security Agreement  ] was approved , [MISC Iranian  ] officials portrayed it positively , emphasizing the stipulation that [LOC Iraq  ] 's territory will not be used to attack a neighbor and that [LOC U.S.  ] forces would leave by the end of 2011. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) This public posturing may play on fears we 've heard from [LOC Basra  ] to [LOC Anbar  ] to [LOC Kurdistan  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] drawdown will create a vacuum that [LOC Iran  ] will attempt to fill . 
But if [LOC Iran  ] adopts too high a public profile , it risks further backlash because of nationalistic [MISC Iraqi  ] pride as well as economic , political and cultural grievances . 
For example , a [LOC Shia  ] member of the [ORG Council of Representatives  ] warned us recently of the pernicious effects of [LOC Iran  ] on [LOC Shia  ] religious doctrine , seeking [ORG USG  ] support for a media outlet for [MISC Iraqi Shi'a  ] clerics who will resist [MISC Iranian  ] theology ( ref D ) . 
Contacts of [LOC REO Basra  ] blame the rising price of housing on [MISC Iranian  ] real estate ; likewise , [MISC Iranian  ] agriculture is blamed for undercutting local competition ( ref E ) . 
The [ORG GOI  ] is rejecting Qundercutting local competition ( ref E ) . 
The [ORG GOI  ] is rejecting [MISC Iranian  ] claims to reinstate the 1975 [ORG Algiers Accord  ] about the [LOC Shatt al-Arab  ] , and it is blaming [MISC Iranian  ] dams for sharply cutting water supplies reaching northeast . 
[PER Maliki  ] and his team do not trust the [MISC Iranians  ] and their militia games -- [LOC Basra  ] being a prime example , but also [LOC Sadr City  ] and [MISC AAH.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) While some [MISC Iraqi  ] fears of [MISC Iranian  ] influence are exaggerated , [MISC IRGC-QF  ] operatives do expect a more permissive operating environment as [LOC U.S.  ] forces draw down ( ref F ) . 
At the same time , the drawdown will remove some threats the [MISC Iranians  ] perceive near the [MISC Iran-Iraq  ] border . 
An [MISC Iranian  ] Unmanned [ORG Arial Vehicle  ] ( [ORG UAV  ] ) shot down by [LOC U.S.  ] forces in February was sent to scout two such targets: [LOC Camp Ashraf  ] and a [LOC U.S.  ] military base . 
In the absence of such perceived threats , and distracted by economic woes and internal discord , it is possible that [LOC Iran  ] will become less preoccupied with security threats from [LOC Iraq  ] . 
However , considering [LOC Iran  ] 's long history of confrontation with [LOC Iraq  ] , its unease about enduring [MISC Iraqi-American  ] cooperation , and its [LOC BAGHDAD  ] 00001104 003 OF 003 delegation of [LOC Iraq  ] policy to the belligerent anti-American [MISC IRGC-QF  ] , [LOC Iran  ] will likely continue to support extremists in [LOC Iraq  ] , perhaps building extremist groups into a [MISC Lebanese  ] [ORG Hezbollah-style  ] political-military organization as a hedge against a resurgent [MISC Iraqi  ] central government. ---------------------------- New challenges , [ORG USG  ] response ---------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) We will continue to assist the [MISC Iraqi  ] government in developing that capacity through political , diplomatic , economic , rule of law , and security cooperation as outlined in Embassy and [MISC MNF-I  ] 's [ORG Joint Campaign Plan  ] and the [ORG Mission Strategic Plan  ] . 
Among current initiatives: the [ORG Local Governance Program  ] to strengthen local government administrative capacity and civic engagement ; assistance for [MISC Iraqi  ] farmers to develop the agricultural sector ; training for the [ORG Central Bank  ] 's [ORG Money Laundering Unit  ] to combat financial crime ; engagement with [LOC Iraq  ] 's neighbors to strengthen its regional integration ; and advice for [MISC Iraqi  ] officials on an information strategy to respond to malign [MISC Iranian  ] interference in [MISC Iraqi  ] affairs . 
Success in these efforts requires a whole-of-government approach , and sufficient funding for non-military initiatives is vital . 
( Note: Ref F outlines a [ORG USG  ] strategy for maintaining pressure on the [MISC IRGC-QF  ] in [LOC Iraq  ] as [LOC U.S.  ] military forces draw down . 
) ------- Comment ------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The view of [LOC Iran  ] from [LOC Iraq  ] is shaped by complaints from [MISC Iraqi  ] businessmen about [MISC Iranian  ] competition , warnings from [MISC Iraqis  ] on the street about [MISC Iranian  ] expansionism , whispers from [MISC Iraqi  ] politicians about [MISC Iranian  ] influence , and the occasional sound of [MISC Iranian  ] munitions whistling overhead . 
While none of these need necessarily affect the [ORG USG  ] approach on engagement with [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Iran  ] 's response to the drawdown of [LOC U.S.  ] military forces in [LOC Iraq  ] will not improve the climate for talks . 
In fact , elements of the [MISC Iranian  ] government opposed to engagement with [LOC America  ] may use the instigation of violence in [LOC Iraq  ] as a spoiler . 
However , the [MISC Iraqi  ] government and [MISC Iraqi  ] people are not as vulnerable as they were in 2003 ; they are increasingly willing and able to defend their own interests . 
Continued strengthening of the [MISC Iraqi-American  ] partnership will improve their capacity to counter and balance [MISC Iranian  ] influence , and keeping [LOC Iraq  ] informed of our progress on engagement with [LOC Iran  ] will allay concerns that [LOC Iraq  ] 's national interests are on the table .
