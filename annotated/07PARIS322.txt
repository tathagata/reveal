END SUMMARY [ORG GSPC  ] THREAT AND THE [LOC MAGHREB  ] --------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) [LOC France  ] , s chief counterterrorism judge , [PER Jean-Louis Bruguiere  ] , told us on January 19 that he found an apparent escalation in [ORG GSPC  ] activities in the [LOC Maghreb  ] during the past several months particularly worrisome . 
[LOC France  ] , he said , was at a higher state of alert and would likely remain so for the foreseeable future . 
While there was no specific threat information , he said the [ORG GoF  ] was convinced that cells and supporters were prepared to be active in [LOC France  ] and [LOC Europe  ] . 
The dismantling of at least two , relatively major , [MISC Islamic  ] cells on [MISC French  ] territory every year showed a clear and present threat . 
Information exchange with [LOC Tunisia  ] , he said , was now virtually non-existent . 
The [MISC Tunisian  ] government was either in denial or did not know how to proceed and was shutting out the [MISC French  ] . 
[LOC Morocco  ] continues to be relatively reliable with information , with [LOC Algeria  ] as , " as usual , " excellent on some days and like [LOC Tunisia  ] on others . 
( [PER COMMENT: Bruguiere  ] , s characterization of operational cooperation with the [LOC Maghreb  ] is worse than other C/T contacts have previously reported . 
[PER Bruguiere  ] , s observations , therefore , may or may not apply to all of the [MISC French  ] intelligence services . 
End Comment ) U.S./FRANCE COOPERATION ----------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) [PER Bruguiere  ] commented that U.S./France judicial and operational exchanges remained excellent . 
He said that while [LOC France  ] , s legal system gave him much more discretion than the [LOC U.S.  ] system , our ability to work together was not hindered by this ; we had to be creative . 
( [PER Note: Bruguiere  ] was an expert witness in the successful prosecution of [PER Ahmed Ressam  ] in the famed [LOC L.A.  ] trial , the [LOC U.S.  ] vs. [PER Ahmed Ressam  ] ) . 
[LOC PAKISTAN  ] -------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) The judge praised DNI [PER John Negroponte  ] , s comments on [LOC Pakistan  ] during a recent [ORG Congressional  ] intelligence briefing . 
He said he was convinced that [LOC Pakistan  ] posed the single greatest threat to global security . 
President [PER Musharaf  ] , he noted , lacked real control over both the territory of the country and security and military agencies . 
Rogue elements from [LOC Pakistan  ] , he insisted , were the most likely to provide nuclear weapons and safe-haven to terrorists . 
[LOC RWANDA  ] ------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) [PER Bruguiere  ] confirmed that he had consulted within the [ORG GoF  ] on his issuance of arrest warrants in the cases brought [LOC PARIS  ] 00000322 002 OF 002 against nine of President [PER Kagame  ] , s top aides for assassination of President [PER Habyarimana  ] and three [MISC French  ] aircraft crew ( see reftel A ) . 
He said he presented his decision to [MISC French  ] officials , including President [PER Chirac  ] , as his independent judicial right , but chose to consult with them because he was convinced of the need to coordinate timing with the government . 
[PER Bruguiere  ] said he was not surprised by [LOC Rwanda  ] , s official reaction , and said that the [ORG GoF  ] had prepared for what it thought would be a violent response against [MISC French  ] nationals . 
He praised his own decision to move forward , adding that the international community had a certain moral responsibility , and that his actions were in the pursuit of justice . 
[PER Bruguiere  ] was satisfied that the nine individuals he listed could not leave [LOC Rwanda  ] without fear of arrest , but was doubtful the [ORG ICTR  ] would take up the case . 
( [PER COMMENT: Bruguiere  ] , s presented his case in a very professional manner , but he did not hide his personal desire to see [PER Kagame  ] , s government isolated . 
He warned that closer [LOC U.S.  ] ties with [LOC Rwanda  ] would be a mistake . 
END COMMENT ) [PER BRUGUIERE  ] MOVING ON ? -------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Since 1982 [PER Bruguiere  ] has been one of the leading players in the [MISC French  ] fight against terrorism , and he is considered a leading world expert in terrorism . 
He has been the chief of the [MISC French  ] counterterrorism court , created in 1986 , since its inception . 
He has survived at least one direct assassination attempt , and is the most visible counterterrorism figure in [LOC France  ] .
