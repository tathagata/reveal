( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ambassador met with [PER Mohammad Ali  ] al-Hweij , the Secretary of the General People 's [ORG Committee  ] for Industry , [ORG Economy  ] and [ORG Trade ( Economy  ] ministry-equivalent ) on December 29 to brief him on the upcoming [ORG U.S. Trade Mission  ] ( February 20-22 , 2010 ) and to seek al-Hweij 's support for the delegation . 
The Ambassador said this trade mission would build on the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Libya  ] 's shared goal of attracting more [MISC American  ] companies , in diverse fields , to [LOC Libya  ] . 
He also emphasized that the companies are major [MISC Fortune 500  ] firms and cannot be left wondering whether they will receive their visas until the last minute . 
Secretary al-Hweij said he welcomed the delegation and would work on securing visas for the group . 
He also said he would personally meet with the delegation and would provide a schedule of site visits and meetings for them . 
The Ambassador also highlighted the need to secure visa approvals for several [ORG Department of Commerce  ] employees who will come to [LOC Libya  ] in advance of the delegation in order to prepare the schedule and make other logistical arrangements . 
[PER Al-Hweij  ] said he would direct his staff to follow-up with the Embassy to ensure the visas were approved on time. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ambassador noted that [LOC U.S.  ] companies had expressed serious concerns with a recent edict that requires foreign companies to hire [MISC Libyan  ] general managers . 
[PER Al-Hweij  ] said he had reached an agreement with Prime Minister al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi that the edict would be revised and only representative offices of foreign companies would be required to have [MISC Libyan  ] managers . 
He said that managers of branch offices of foreign companies could be of any nationality but that if the manager were [MISC Libyan  ] , the company 's [MISC Libyan  ] license would be valid for five years . 
If the manager were foreign , the license would be valid for only three years. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As for [LOC U.S.  ] heavy machinery firm [ORG Caterpillar  ] 's efforts to resolve its status in [LOC Libya  ] ( Ref A ) , al-Hweij said negotiations for the joint venture partnership with the [MISC Economic  ] and [ORG Social Development Fund  ] ( [ORG ESDF  ] ) were almost completed . 
He said that even before the agreement is signed , however , [ORG Caterpillar  ] may continue to import machinery and spare parts into [LOC Libya  ] via its [MISC European  ] agent . 
The Ambassador noted that a [ORG Trade and Investment Framework Agreement  ] ( [ORG TIFA  ] ) would provide a useful system for resolving such issues in the future , and told al-Hweij that the [MISC Libyans'  ] revised draft of the [ORG TIFA  ] was with the [ORG U.S. Trade Representative  ] 's office for review. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ambassador informed al-Hweij that a [LOC U.S.  ] federal judge from the [ORG Court of International Trade  ] in [LOC New York  ] will visit [LOC Libya  ] next week ( Jan. 3-7 ) to conduct a workshop for [MISC Libyan  ] judges on international commercial arbitration , held in cooperation with the General People 's [ORG Committee  ] for [ORG Justice  ] ( [ORG Ministry of Justice-equivalent  ] ) ( see Ref B ) . 
[PER Al-Hweij  ] said he welcomed this initiative and he would send a representative to the workshop . 
He also looked forward to meeting the judge during her visit if possible . 
He noted that [LOC Libya  ] was in the process of revising its commercial laws in order to streamline procedures for registering companies and to modernize the commercial code . 
He said that [LOC Libya  ] had 20 laws bearing on commercial matters , with some dating from 1953 . 
The legal reform is part of the current five-year plan to refurbish [LOC Libya  ] 's infrastructure and he hoped [LOC Libya  ] would finish the [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00001043 002.2 OF 002 program by 2013 when a new five-year plan would begin . 
[PER Al-Hweij  ] said he would brief the trade mission on these and other developments on [LOC Libya  ] 's economic and commercial situation. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: [PER Hweij  ] , like senior [ORG MFA  ] officials who have been briefed on the [ORG Trade Mission  ] , appeared to welcome to the initiative . 
However , we continue to face severe problems in the issuance of [MISC Libyan  ] visas for USG and USG-sponsored travelers . 
Continued high-level engagement likely will be required to ensure that visas for the delegation and support staff will be issued in a timely fashion . 
We will continue to press the issue .
