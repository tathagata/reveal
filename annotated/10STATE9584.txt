Background <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
In March 2007 , after three-and-a-half years and eleven formal rounds of negotiations , [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG EU  ] negotiators initialed the text of a comprehensive , first-stage [ORG Air Transport Agreement  ] . 
The [ORG Agreement  ] was signed in April 2007 and has been provisionally applied since March 30 , 2008 . 
The [ORG Agreement  ] replaces 16 existing bilateral [ORG Open Skies  ] agreements and five more restrictive aviation agreements between the [LOC United States  ] and Member [LOC States  ] , and establishes an " [ORG Open Skies-Plus  ] " framework applicable to the [LOC United States  ] and all 27 [ORG EU  ] Member [LOC States  ] . 
[LOC Norway  ] and [LOC Iceland  ] are joining the [ORG Agreement  ] on the [MISC European  ] side. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
The [ORG Agreement  ] contains all the essential elements of an [ORG Open Skies  ] agreement and elements beyond those in traditional [ORG Open Skies  ] accords . 
The [ORG Agreement  ] includes a binding commitment to undertake negotiation of a second stage agreement , and identifies these items of priority interest to one or both of the parties to be included on the agenda: further liberalization of traffic rights ; additional foreign investment opportunities ; effect of environmental measures and infrastructure constraints on the exercise of traffic rights ; further access to government-financed air transportation ; and provision of aircraft with crew. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
Second stage negotiations began in May 2008 , and six rounds have taken place . 
The negotiations have been constructive , and significant progress has been made across a range of important issues , including security , regulatory cooperation , and the role of the [ORG Joint Committee  ] established by the [ORG Agreement  ] . 
Further work remains to be done on other key areas , including market access , investment , environmental constraints , cooperation on environmental issues , and the social ( labor ) dimension . 
Representatives of [LOC Norway  ] and [LOC Iceland  ] participate in the negotiations as observers on the [MISC European  ] delegation. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
At the November 3 , 2009 [MISC U.S.-EU  ] Summit President [PER Obama  ] and his [ORG EU  ] counterparts called for a second stage air transport agreement by the end of 2010 which includes benefits for both sides . 
[ORG EU  ] leaders at the summit included President of the [ORG European Commission  ] [PER Jose Manuel Barroso  ] , Commissioner [PER Benita Ferrero-Waldner  ] , [MISC Swedish  ] Prime Minister [PER Fredrik Reinfeldt  ] and Foreign Minister [PER Carl Bild  ] , representing the [ORG EU  ] Presidency , and High Representative [PER Javier Solana.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
The seventh -- and potentially decisive -- round of the second stage negotiations will take place in [LOC Madrid February  ] 15-17 . 
To reach agreement within the timetable the leaders have set , both sides must now take a very realistic and pragmatic approach to developing nuanced agreement language necessary to bridge the gap between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG EU  ] positions. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
Begin points . 
-- At the November 3 , 2009 [MISC U.S.-EU  ] Summit President [PER Obama  ] and his [ORG EU  ] counterparts called for a second stage [MISC U.S.-EU  ] air transport agreement by the end of 2010 which includes benefits for both sides . 
-- [LOC Spain  ] has said that among its top objectives during its Presidency is achieving agreements with the [LOC United States  ] , including a second stage air transport agreement . 
-- [LOC Spain  ] is hosting the seventh round of [MISC U.S.-EU  ] second stage air transport negotiations in [LOC Madrid February  ] 15-17 . 
-- Significant progress has been made in past rounds on a broad range of subjects . 
The [LOC United States  ] has undertaken a thorough analysis of the remaining issues and is convinced that compromise by both sides will be required if we are to reach a second stage agreement by the end of 2010 . 
-- Both sides must be realistic about what is achievable , in the time available , tempering ambition with pragmatism . 
-- The [LOC United States  ] recognizes that our principal request -- fundamental change in the way decisions are made on noise-related operational restrictions at [ORG EU  ] airports -- presents difficult policy and legal challenges for Member [LOC States  ] . 
-- We hope that [MISC European  ] participants understand that a commitment to change [LOC U.S.  ] law on ownership and control of [LOC U.S.  ] carriers is not achievable within the timeframe set by our leaders for achieving a second stage agreement .
