( U ) SUMMARY . 
[MISC Bahamian  ] Minister of [ORG Immigration  ] [PER Shane Gibson  ] resigned February 18 following publication of photographs of [PER Gibson  ] embracing [PER Smith  ] in her bed . 
The photos , which also appeared to show an exchange of gifts , created additional press and opposition scrutiny of potential irregularities in [ORG Smith’s  ] dealings with the [ORG Ministry of Immigration  ] . 
These revelations generated pressure resulting in [LOC Gibson’s  ] resignation from Cabinet February 18 . 
The [PER Gibson  ] affair is the latest of several scandals to hit the ruling [ORG Progressive Liberal Party  ] ( [ORG PLP  ] ) heading to election . 
The opposition [ORG Free National Movement  ] ( [ORG FNM  ] ) has used these scandals to seize the offensive in the run-up to elections . 
The tense pre-election climate with renewed focus on government scandal will certainly help the opposition , but whether ongoing corruption allegations can overcome a relatively strong economy , job growth and an increase in social programs under the [ORG PLP  ] is uncertain . 
END SUMMARY . 
Minister [PER Gibson  ] Resigns Over Photo Scandal ------------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) On February 18 , Minister of [ORG Immigration  ] [PER Shane Gibson  ] resigned his Cabinet seat following publication of photos showing him in a bedroom embrace with celebrity [PER Anna Nicole Smith  ] . 
The photos , published by The [ORG Tribune  ] in the intense media frenzy following [ORG Smith’s  ] February 8 death , led to public questions about [LOC Gibson’s  ] relationship with [PER Smith  ] and his decision to quickly grant her [MISC Bahamian  ] residency outside of the usual lengthy process . 
New allegations against [PER Gibson  ] included claims he accepted a $25,000 watch from [PER Smith  ] , that [LOC Gibson’s  ] father accepted work sailing [ORG Smith’s  ] yacht , and that [LOC Gibson’s  ] mother was paid $500/week to baby-sit [ORG Smith’s  ] daughter . 
A police investigation under anti-bribery laws is under way . 
Despite the scandal , [PER Gibson  ] retains his parliamentary seat and may run for reelection . 
Wounded [MISC PLP Strikes Back  ] on [ORG FNM  ] Terms ------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Continuing to deny any wrongdoing , [PER Gibson  ] and Prime Minister [PER Christie  ] responded to press and opposition criticism by aggressively defending [PER Gibson  ] and attacking a “conspiracy” led by the [ORG FNM  ] and the [ORG Tribune  ] , the largest circulation daily paper that published the photos . 
[PER Christie  ] and other [ORG PLP  ] candidates have countered by slinging mud over alleged wrongdoing during [ORG FNM  ] rule , including a claim the [ORG FNM  ] fast-tracked an application for an alleged pedophile . 
[PER Gibson  ] has threatened a lawsuit against the [ORG Tribune  ] and has reportedly engaged counsel. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) According to a source in the [MISC FNM’s  ] leadership , even before the photographs of [PER Gibson  ] in bed with [PER Smith  ] , the [ORG FNM  ] would have focused its campaign in part on transparency and corruption in the ruling party . 
The [ORG FNM  ] had alleged irregular visa issuances , lack of transparency in financial accounts , and possible corruption in a government housing development . 
Some observers feel that the [MISC PLP’s  ] delay in calling elections was intended to diffuse concerns over these allegations , and that the renewed focus on [PER Gibson  ] and [PER Smith  ] ensured further delay before elections are called . 
NOTE: Under the [MISC Bahamian  ] Constitution , [ORG Parliament  ] must be dissolved and elections called no later than May 22 , with elections held within 90 days thereafter . 
Traditionally , elections are not called during Lent . 
END NOTE . 
[PER Gibson  ] and Press [PER Won’t Go Away  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) COMMENT: The [MISC Gibson-Anna  ] Nicole scandal gives the [ORG FNM  ] just the focus it hoped for in a campaign already designed to question the [MISC PLP’s  ] integrity . 
Whether such a strategy can overcome a relatively strong economy , job growth and an increase in social programs under the [ORG PLP  ] is uncertain . 
Regardless , it must be frustrating to the [ORG PLP  ] that [PER Gibson  ] continued his relationship with [PER Smith  ] against party advice after the scandal first broke in the Fall . 
Regardless of party grumbling about [PER Gibson  ] , his strong constituency support -- he won his seat by a landslide in 2002 and he enjoys the patronage of political heavyweight Bishop [PER Neil Ellis  ] -- will ensure that [PER Gibson  ] stays in the [MISC PLP’s  ] plans. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The international media circus surrounding [PER Smith  ] and [PER Gibson  ] will likely continue for some time , keeping the [LOC Bahamas  ] in the international limelight for better or worse . 
On the plus side , the [LOC Bahamas  ] has received more free advertising than they could ever have hoped to buy , and taxi operators are already cashing in by offering visits to the former [PER Smith  ] residence . 
On the negative side , many poorly informed commentators have given air time to claims that the [LOC Bahamas  ] is awash in drugs and corruption . 
Items sure to attract continued international media intention include: scheduled hearings regarding ownership of Horizons , the [LOC Nassau  ] home where [PER Smith  ] lived ; a [MISC Bahamian  ] coroner’s inquest into the death of [ORG Smith’s  ] son ; potential fights over keeping [ORG Smith’s  ] body in The [LOC Bahamas  ] ; and the ongoing police investigation into potential bribery of [PER Gibson  ] . 
The media has set up camp across the street from her former residence on [LOC Eastern Road  ] and , on hearing days , on the courthouse steps . 
While easy to discount the tabloid journalism surrounding these issues , it is encouraging that the local press -- too often cautious with government and lacking strong in investigative journalists -- has been able to help hold a powerful member of the government accountable for allegedly accepting gifts and providing favoritism in the execution of his duties .
