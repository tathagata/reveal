Schulte  ] FOR REASONS 1.4 ( c ) AND ( e ) ------- Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [ORG P5  ] 1 experts and an [ORG EU  ] representative met at the [LOC U.K. Mission  ] on March 9 to discuss technical issues contained in the [ORG IAEA  ] Director General’s reports on [LOC Iran  ] and what that report implies for [MISC Iran’s  ] progress on its nuclear program . 
This was the third meeting in a series of similar experts’ discussions ( previously held in May 2008 and June 2007 ) . 
By pre-agreement , the meetings do not produce agreed/common conclusions , but there were no objections to the [LOC UK  ] Ambassador’s summary of discussions noting that [MISC Iran’s  ] current centrifuge operations at [LOC Natanz  ] were not adequate to support Tehran’s stated commercial objective , although they had improved substantially over the 2007 performance . 
The experts also noted it was of concern that [LOC Iran  ] has not cooperated with the [ORG IAEA  ] on issues related to possible military dimensions . 
All agreed to show continued support for the IAEA’s investigation into these issues. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [LOC France  ] , the [LOC U.K.  ] , and the [LOC U.S.  ] provided all the presentations on [MISC Iran’s  ] nuclear fuel cycle , weaponization-related activities , and [ORG IAEA  ] safeguards , but [LOC Russia  ] offered useful commentary about the status of the [LOC Bushehr  ] power reactor . 
[LOC China  ] was more engaged than in previous meetings and was heavily focused on questions regarding [MISC Iran’s  ] centrifuge performance and the possibility of further progress by [LOC Iran  ] on that front . 
DDG for Safeguards [PER Olli Heinonen  ] participated at the end of the session and usefully answered questions about [MISC Iran’s  ] centrifuge program and [MISC Iran’s  ] refusal to allow [ORG IAEA  ] access to the [ORG Heavy Water Research Reactor  ] . 
He also reviewed the fact that select sensitive issues from the August 2007 work plan had been kicked back to the “alleged studies basket” in order to facilitate reaching that basket as the [ORG IAEA  ] attempts to engage the [MISC Iranians  ] on the most sensitive , military-related aspects of the investigation . 
[PER Heinonen  ] was unambiguous in dismissing [MISC Iran’s  ] “need” to have copies of the “alleged studies” documents , an issue unhelpfully raised by the [MISC German  ] [ORG DCM  ] . 
Overall , experts found the discussions useful , especially since there seemed to be no dissent on the unofficial conclusions made . 
No one objected to the Chair’s suggestion that the group should meet again . 
End Summary. -------------------------------------- The [ORG Enrichment Part of the Fuel Cycle  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [MISC French  ] began the discussion by highlighting [MISC Iran’s  ] indigenous sources of uranium -- from phosphate deposits ( a potential future source ) , the [LOC Saghand  ] uranium mine , and the [LOC Gachin  ] uranium mine . 
The [MISC French  ] noted that the ore processing facility at [LOC Ardakan  ] , which will process the uranium from [LOC Saghand  ] , is scheduled to start operations in March 2009 , according to [MISC Iranian  ] statements , while the current status of the ore processing facility at [LOC Gachin  ] is unknown . 
They also pointed out that even if the mines at [LOC Saghand  ] and [LOC Gachin  ] operated at their stated capacity of approximately 70 tons per year , this amount of uranium would support only about 50 percent of the demonstrated capacity of the [ORG Uranium Conversion Facility  ] ( [ORG UCF  ] ) at [LOC Esfahan  ] . 
Regarding activities at the [ORG UCF  ] , the [MISC French  ] explained that [MISC Iran’s  ] current uranium stockpile was dwindling , with less than 100 tons of uranium remaining , and that [LOC Iran  ] had significantly slowed down operations at the [ORG UCF  ] during 2008 and 2009 , most likely to preserve its declining stockpile . 
The [MISC French  ] noted that [LOC Iran  ] is thought to have uranium-bearing phosphate rock deposits in the northern part of the country , with uranium content ranging from 50 to 700 parts per million , and that [LOC Iran  ] might in the future look to exploit these deposits . 
Regarding potential sources for importing additional uranium , the [MISC French  ] experts mentioned the [LOC Congo  ] without further elaboration . 
Such transfers are proscribed under UNSCR 1737. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [LOC U.S.  ] noted that operations at the [ORG UCF  ] already have been impacted by the uranium shortage and that [LOC Iran  ] can never be fully independent for its complete nuclear fuel cycle . 
The [LOC U.K.  ] added that the current uranium shortage will not have a near term impact on operations at [LOC Natanz  ] , since [LOC Iran  ] has plenty of UF6 to keep existing centrifuges running for several years . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] suggested that countries should be on the look out for [LOC Iran  ] trying to procure uranium or large amounts of uranium-bearing phosphate rock from abroad , and also possible efforts to modify existing phosphoric acid production lines to extract the uranium. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Turning to enrichment-related activities , the [LOC U.K.  ] led the discussion with a detailed presentation on [MISC Iran’s  ] centrifuge progress and performance in 2008 . 
The [LOC U.K.  ] estimated that the [MISC IR-1  ] ( P-1 ) cascades at the Fuel [ORG Enrichment Plant  ] ( [ORG FEP  ] ) performed at an average level of 0.6 separative work units ( [ORG SWU  ] ) per machine-year during 2008 . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] indicated agreement with this value , adding that performance peaked during mid-2008 and declined somewhat since then . 
The [LOC U.K.  ] developed a sliding scale of [MISC Iranian  ] uranium enrichment , concluding that after 5 years , [LOC Iran  ] could possess 20 tons of low enriched uranium hexafluoride ( UF6 ) with 8 units of 3,000 centrifuge machines , at [MISC Iran’s  ] current pace of installation--approximately 2 cascades per month--and operation . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] noted that this was about two-thirds of the amount needed for a single annual fuel reload for a [MISC Bushehr-type  ] reactor . 
[LOC Russia  ] inquired as to [LOC UK  ] views on whether [LOC Iran  ] has enough centrifuge parts to continue cascade installation at a rate 2 per month ; the [LOC U.K.  ] noted that it is conceivable that they do , but that it is difficult to say absent further [MISC Iranian  ] transparency . 
The [LOC U.K.  ] noted that it is possible [LOC Iran  ] still needs to procure some associated parts . 
Both the [LOC U.K.  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] noted that [LOC Iran  ] had operated its centrifuges at [LOC Natanz  ] considerably better in 2008 than in 2007 , but it was implausible , as disussed at the previous experts meeting , that [LOC Tehran  ] could reach its claimed commercial program goal with the [MISC P1-type/IR-1  ] centrifuges. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [LOC Russia  ] agreed that equipping all 8 cascade units or beyond at [LOC Natanz  ] with [LOC P-1/IR-1  ] machines was a “waste” in the commercial context . 
[LOC Russia  ] also replied that [LOC Iran  ] does not need a commercial program to support the [LOC Bushehr  ] reactor because [LOC Russia  ] already has committed to support the lifetime operations of that reactor , including by providing fuel . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] commented that although centrifuge operations in 2008 were “mediocre , ” [LOC Iran  ] had now demonstrated centrifuge operations such that it had the technical ability to produce highly enriched uranium ( [ORG HEU  ] ) if it so chose . 
Consequently , even if [LOC Iran  ] did not have a viable commercial capability , [LOC Iran  ] is capable of producing significant amounts of low enriched uranium . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] also called into question the assumption that [LOC Iran  ] was focused on developing a commercial capability , and that it is possible [LOC Iran  ] was intending only to demonstrate a “fait accompli” capability in the face of international pressure and to produce a stockpile of [LOC LEU.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [LOC U.S.  ] asked what were the drivers--political , technical , or both--for [LOC Iran  ] not feeding UF6 into the nine installed , but not-yet-operating , cascades in [LOC Unit A26  ] , and when might [LOC Iran  ] transition from the [MISC IR-1  ] centrifuge to one of the new generation machines . 
The [LOC U.K.  ] agreed with the [LOC U.S.  ] comment that it was possible that [LOC Iran  ] was performing more mechanical and quality control tests , and fixing leaks and other problems before proceeding forward with operations of additional cascades , unlike in the past. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [LOC Germany  ] said it had a “feeling” that [LOC Iran  ] would use the first cascade hall of 27,000 machines for the [MISC IR-1  ] centrifuges and fill the second cascade hall with the more advanced centrifuges . 
The [LOC U.K.  ] responded that the relatively low numbers of the new generation centrifuge machines--IR-2 , IR-3 , and [MISC IR-4--in  ] the pilot fuel enrichment plant ( [ORG PFEP  ] ) at [LOC Natanz  ] seems to indicate that the [MISC Iranians  ] are still in the test and development stage. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [LOC France  ] presented a chart of [MISC Iran’s  ] production of low enriched UF6 and asked for others’ assessments on how much low enriched uranium ( [ORG LEU  ] ) would equate to a “significant quantity” ( [ORG SQ  ] ) of [ORG HEU  ] , if it were further enriched and converted to metal . 
The [LOC U.K.  ] responded that in a simple steady-state system , 1000 kg of low enriched UF6 would equal one [ORG SQ  ] , but [LOC Iran  ] would need more than that for its first weapons-worth of material . 
[LOC France  ] noted their estimates were roughly around 1500 kg for [MISC Iran’s  ] first weapon . 
There was no dissent among experts to 1500 kg as the likely threshold . 
[LOC France  ] also asked if [LOC Iran  ] could produce 20 percent enriched uranium at [LOC Natanz  ] using its existing cascade configuration . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] indicated that [LOC Iran  ] could re-feed the 3.5 percent enriched uranium that it currently is producing to achieve roughly 20 percent enrichment , but did not know what measures [LOC Iran  ] might have to take to ensure the higher enrichment level did not produce a safety/criticality issue in the cascade feed and withdrawal systems . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] pointed out that it would be more practical to use only a portion of the existing cascades for such re-feeding , leaving the remaining cascades to continue low enriched UF6 production. -------------------------- The [ORG Reactor Side of Things  ] -------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The [LOC U.K.  ] led a short discussion on reactors and fuel fabrication , noting that this section of [MISC Iran’s  ] fuel cycle was well behind the uranium enrichment track . 
In a particularly helpful intervention , [LOC Russia  ] reiterated ( without prompting ) the statement it had made at the previous experts meeting that [MISC Iran’s  ] fuel cycle/fuel fabrication activity currently has no connection to the [LOC Bushehr  ] reactor , because there already is a contract for [LOC Russia  ] to provide 10 fuel loads--which will last for a little more than 10 years--for the reactor . 
Replying to the [LOC U.S.  ] question if it was possible for the fuel to be lQd into [LOC Bushehr  ] the second quarter of this year , as indicated in the [ORG IAEA  ] Director General’s February report , [LOC Russia  ] said that it was possible , but it was more difficult to determine when the reactor would go critical . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] asked if [LOC Russia  ] would supply [LOC Iran  ] with the licensing so that [LOC Tehran  ] could make its own fuel for [LOC Bushehr  ] once the 10-load contract runs out . 
[LOC Russia  ] responded that when negotiating fuel contracts with [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Tehran  ] insisted on only the first 10 loads , but [LOC Russia  ] expects to supply fuel for the lifetime of [LOC Bushehr  ] and it would not agree to provide [LOC Iran  ] the necessary technology/license to make its own fuel for the [LOC Bushehr  ] reactor. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [LOC France  ] asked if the 10-load contract had actually been signed by the [MISC Iranians  ] and was “in effect.” [LOC Russia  ] responded that the contract had been “agreed to , ” and that is what mattered . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] commented that IAEA-sponsored [MISC Iranian  ] safety and regulatory training for [LOC Bushehr  ] was not scheduled until later this year , and posited that there might be a safety issue associated with operating [LOC Bushehr  ] before that training takes place . 
[LOC Russia  ] replied that its technicians would be in charge of all the operations at [LOC Bushehr  ] in the near term , so it did not matter when the safety training for [MISC Iranians  ] took place . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX --------------------------------- Concerns with Lack of Progress on Possible Military Dimensions --------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The [LOC U.S.  ] started the discussion on possible military dimensions ( [ORG PMD  ] ) and noted the [ORG IAEA  ] has not been able to make any progress on this issue of serious concern since August 2008 because of lack of [MISC Iranian  ] cooperation . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] noted that the [ORG IAEA  ] has reported at length on the extensive documentation related to [MISC Iran’s  ] effort to design a nuclear warhead and that the only response [LOC Iran  ] has offered is that the information is “fabricated.” The [LOC U.S.  ] explained that the [ORG IAEA  ] first began reporting on [MISC Iran’s  ] nuclear weaponization-related work in January 2006 and continued to describe in detail the nature of the work in subsequent DG reports and technical briefings. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Recalling the [ORG U.S. Intelligence Community’s  ] assessment in the 2007 NIE that [LOC Iran  ] halted its nuclear weapons work in 2003 , [LOC France  ] asked about information in DDG Safeguards Olli Heinonen’s February 2008 technical briefing which indicated some activities had taken place in 2004 . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] responded that the information in Heinonen’s February 2008 briefing was consistent with the 2003 weaponization halt assessment , since some activities were wrapping up in 2004 . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] commented that acquisition of a nuclear weapons capability requires more than just the work on a nuclear device . 
Instead , production of fissile material is key , and [LOC Iran  ] has continued to develop that capability . 
At the end of the day , the [LOC U.S.  ] noted , it is important for [LOC Iran  ] to fully disclose any past weaponization-related work , implement the Additional Protocol ( [ORG AP  ] ) , suspend all proliferation sensitive nuclear activities , and fully cooperate with the [ORG IAEA  ] in order to begin to restore international confidence in the peaceful nature of [MISC Iran’s  ] nuclear program . 
If [LOC Iran  ] does not do this , [LOC U.S.  ] experts said , that would suggest [LOC Iran  ] wishes to hide and preserve its past work , perhaps to keep a future weapons option open. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) The [LOC U.K.  ] expressed concern that the [ORG PMD  ] issues receive less and less attention in the DG’s reports . 
[LOC Russia  ] agreed , but noted its view that the [ORG IAEA  ] has shared as much information as it has related to [ORG PMD  ] and that there is nothing new to report . 
Sharing the concern that less attention seems to be paid to [ORG PMD  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] recalled that the 2007 NIE assessment indicated that the 2003 weapons halt was at least partially due to the increased international scrutiny and pressure at the time . 
It is extremely important to continue the international pressure , in the [LOC U.S.  ] view , so that [LOC Tehran  ] does not feel comfortable reversing the halt. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) The [ORG DCM  ] from the [MISC German  ] Mission asked why copies of the alleged studies information could not be provided to [LOC Iran  ] and remarked that some Board members saw this as a hindrance to the verification process . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] suggested that it would be a good idea to get Heinonen’s opinion on that issue , in particular whether the [ORG IAEA  ] inspectors truly saw this as a hindrance to their investigation . 
The [LOC U.K.  ] replied that [PER Heinonen  ] has made very clear to them that the [ORG IAEA  ] is not asking for anything more to be shared with [LOC Iran  ] , especially since [LOC Iran  ] refuses to cooperate on what the [ORG IAEA  ] already has shared . 
The [MISC French  ] noted that [LOC Iran  ] still has not provided an answer to the origin of the uranium hemispheres document and how it came to be in [LOC Iran  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] acknowledged this , and noted that it is also important that the [ORG IAEA  ] receive all possible assistance in resolving concerns that foreign expertise was provided to [LOC Iran  ] regarding design of an implosion device. ------------------------ Other Outstanding Issues ------------------------ <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) The [LOC U.S.  ] noted that in addition to the outstanding issues related to [ORG PMD  ] , [LOC Iran  ] still has not clarified the [MISC IAEA’s  ] concerns about the nature of the [MISC Lavizan  ] facility and equipment , has not granted the [ORG IAEA  ] access to the [LOC Gachin  ] mine and ore processing plant , and that several issues from the August 2007 work plan that were not resolved were pushed to the “alleged studies” section of the work plan . 
[LOC Russia  ] asked how the [ORG IAEA  ] could address all these issues as long as [LOC Iran  ] refuses to implement the [ORG AP  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] replied that the [ORG UNSC  ] has empowered the [ORG IAEA  ] to resolve all outstanding issues ; therefore , the [ORG IAEA  ] has the right to seek clarifications on these issues , but cannot do so without [MISC Iranian  ] cooperation. --------------------------- Safeguards and Verification --------------------------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [LOC France  ] took the lead in discussing safeguards and verification of [MISC Iran’s  ] nuclear program by mentioning that the [ORG IAEA  ] has been able to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material , implement full safeguards at [LOC Natanz  ] , and perform 21 unannounced inspections at [LOC Natanz  ] , but [LOC Iran  ] continues to refuse design information verification ( [ORG DIV  ] ) access to the [MISC IR-40  ] and design information for the reactor to be built at [LOC Darkhovin  ] . 
[LOC France  ] also noted the problems in the past that [LOC Iran  ] created over the designation of inspectors and issuing visas . 
[LOC France  ] recalled the [ORG IAEA’s Legal Office  ] opinion , provided during the March Board meeting , that [MISC Iran’s  ] refusal to implement [MISC Code 3.1 Modified  ] and allow [ORG IAEA  ] access to the [MISC IR-40  ] reactor was inconsistent with [MISC Tehran’s  ] safeguards obligations . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] noted that we should inquire with [PER Heinonen  ] as to the point at which failure to provide [ORG DIV  ] access was imperiling safeguards integrity. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) Describing additional concerns about the [MISC IAEA’s  ] ability to verify/investigate [MISC Iran’s  ] nuclear program , [LOC France  ] stated that there were less than a dozen inspectors in Ops B , there continues to be a rapid turnover of [ORG IAEA  ] officials associated with the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear account , and the [MISC IAEA’s  ] “Iranian” expertise is tenuous , citing the retirement of the [MISC IAEA’s  ] centrifuge expert last summer . 
[LOC Germany  ] agreed that there were a lot of issues with [MISC Iran’s  ] cooperation , but the biggest problem most likely was the non-implementation of the [ORG AP  ] , especially if there was an undeclared facility somewhere in [LOC Iran  ] . 
[LOC France  ] reiterated the importance of [MISC Code 3.1 Modified  ] , and commented that we should focus on the issue of prompting [MISC Iranian  ] implementation of its related obligations. ----------------------------- U.K.’s Summary of Discussions ----------------------------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) The [LOC U.K.  ] Ambassador summarized the main points from the meeting , stating clearly these were not “official , agreed to positions , ” but just general conclusions from the Chair’s perspective . 
( [ORG Note: China  ] and [LOC Russia  ] came to the meeting in the understanding that ground rules from the previous meetings would obtain , ground rules which preclude any formal agreement on shared conclusions . 
End note . 
) The main points were: --Iran’s centrifuge operations in 2008 had improved from 2007 , but the centrifuge performance still was relatively poor and not at a steady state ; --the performance of [MISC Iran’s  ] centrifuge operations was not adequate to achieve [MISC Tehran’s  ] stated commercial goals ; --delays in centrifuge cascade commissioning may have more to do with centrifuge operators attempting to address performance problems than any political signal from [LOC Tehran  ] to the international community ; --there has been a complete lack of progress on [ORG PMD  ] and the [ORG IAEA  ] has been unable to report any developments on these issues ; --the P5 1 shared the concern that the outstanding issues have not been adequately addressed by [LOC Iran  ] , and [LOC Tehran  ] must provide the [ORG IAEA  ] access to individuals , documentation , and locations associated with [ORG PMD  ] ; and --the P5 1 will continue to support the [ORG IAEA  ] on the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear issue. ------------------------- Session with DDG [PER Heinonen  ] ------------------------- <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) As requested , [PER Heinonen  ] and [ORG IAEA  ] weapons expert [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] joined the meeting before it concluded . 
After a brief summary of the agenda , the [LOC U.K.  ] Chair posed several questions , [PER Heinonen  ] responded and subsequently answered additional questions from the experts . 
[PER Heinonen  ] explained that the [ORG IAEA  ] does not have much access to the actual centrifuges at [LOC Natanz  ] ( as they are inside casings ) , but said the installation of the [LOC IR-1  ] has been linear , although the commissioning--feeding with UF6--has not . 
[PER Heinonen  ] said the believed the installation of the additional [MISC IR-1’s  ] suggests that [LOC Iran  ] has faith in its ability to operate those machines , but he said he would not add to the speculation as to why the [MISC Iranians  ] have not yet fed UF6 into them . 
[PER Heinonen  ] described the low enriched UF6 reporting discrepancy at the physical inventory verification ( [ORG PIV  ] ) in November 2008 as an [MISC Iranian  ] operator calculation error . 
He said the [ORG IAEA  ] is conducting a systematic internal review of the matter and also continues to work closely with [LOC Iran  ] to assess the causes of this error and help change practices in the future so that it does not happen again. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) Regarding the question of providing copies of “alleged studies” documents to [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Heinonen  ] explained in detail that the [ORG IAEA  ] has been seeking answers from [LOC Tehran  ] on these issues since 2005 and that [LOC Iran  ] has been given repeated , ample access to the information , but still claims only that they are “forgeries.” Noting specifically the [MISC IAEA’s  ] attempts to investigate possible military-related procurements , [PER Heinonen  ] described the process by which some questions in the [ORG IAEA  ] work plan for [LOC Iran  ] were kicked back to the final “alleged studies” basket of issues because [LOC Iran  ] would not deal with them under other , earlier issues . 
He also said the work plan stated that “access , ” not copies or originals , to the documentation would be provided to [LOC Iran  ] . 
[LOC Tehran  ] , however , has tried to change the “rules of the game” over time and started to focus on a call to receive “originals” only in September 2008 . 
[PER Heinonen  ] mentioned that he does not foresee any progress on these issues in the near term , especially without [ORG AP  ] access and the implementation of [MISC Code 3.1 Modified.  ] <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) Responding to a question from the [MISC French  ] about visas and the designation of inspectors for [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Heinonen  ] said the [ORG IAEA  ] currently had available the personnel it needs to work in [LOC Iran  ] , but a problem could arise if the [ORG IAEA  ] and [LOC Iran  ] were to hold technical discussions requiring experts/consultants who are not designated inspectors , for example , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
The [LOC U.K.  ] asked what [MISC Iran’s  ] long-term plans were for the installation and operation of the new generation centrifuges at [LOC Natanz  ] . 
[PER Heinonen  ] replied that he thinks [LOC Iran  ] has realized the [MISC IR-1  ] is not the most dependable machine and he would be surprised if [LOC Iran  ] installed 54,000 IR-1s in the [ORG FEP  ] at [LOC Natanz  ] . 
He speculated that maybe the fourth unit of 3,000 machines at the [ORG FEP  ] would consist of a more advanced centrifuge. <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( C ) [LOC Germany  ] asked if the [ORG LEU  ] produced at [LOC Natanz  ] was for [ORG Bushehr  ] fuel and if [LOC Iran  ] could enrich uranium beyond 3.5 percent . 
[PER Heinonen  ] said the safeguards agreement for [LOC Natanz  ] allows up to 5 percent enrichment . 
[LOC Iran  ] could choose to increase that level , but it would have to notify the [ORG IAEA  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] asked if the safeguards approach for [LOC Natanz  ] would change as the number of centrifuges or assay were to increase , and [PER Heinonen  ] responded that the camera positions would have to be rearranged and the frequency of unannounced inspections increased . 
In response to a query from the [LOC U.K.  ] , [PER Heinonen  ] specified that safeguards cameras at [LOC Natanz  ] cover the perimeter of the cascade halls , focusing on input/output points . 
He also noted that , unlike such inspections under the [MISC IAEA’s  ] “Hexapartite” approach to safeguards at enrichment plants , inspectors at [LOC Natanz  ] can go “anywhere underground” they like , i.e. , there is no set course inspectors must follow during unannounced inspections . 
[PER Heinonen  ] said this combined monitoring assures that [LOC Iran  ] cannot take machines in and out of the cascades without the [ORG IAEA  ] knowing. <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( C ) Responding to the [LOC U.S.  ] question about the source of the uranium dioxide ( [ORG UO2  ] ) that [LOC Iran  ] is using to produce fuel rods at the [ORG FMP  ] , [PER Heinonen  ] said he thought the [ORG UO2  ] was being produced at the [ORG UCF  ] , although he was not 100 percent sure . 
He also said that [LOC Iran  ] has a stock of [ORG UO2  ] that it acquired from abroad in the early 1990s . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( C ) The [LOC U.S.  ] commented about the difference between a [MISC State’s  ] legal obligations under the comprehensive safeguards agreement and transparency measures , and how [LOC Syria  ] now seems to be taking cues from [MISC Iran’s  ] behavior . 
Is there really a clean break between obligations and “transparency ? ” [PER Heinonen  ] said he did not think it was a clean break and that it was difficult to make the exact determination of where voluntary transparency begins . 
The [LOC U.K.  ] asked if the Board could assist the [ORG IAEA Secretariat  ] in this area , and [PER Heinonen  ] recalled a 1992 discussion on the strengthening of safeguards as well as States implementing the [MISC AP.  ] <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( C ) [LOC China  ] noted that the assessed [ORG SWU  ] for [MISC Iran’s  ] operations of the [MISC IR-1  ] centrifuge in 2008 was 0.6 and asked if this low number was because of the poor design of the centrifuge . 
[PER Heinonen  ] said , “I wish I knew.” The [LOC U.S.  ] asked if [MISC Iran’s  ] DIV refusal for the [MISC IR-40  ] was an immediate concern and what [LOC Iran  ] planned to do with the spent fuel from that reactor . 
[PER Heinonen  ] said he has no information on spent fuel plans for the [MISC IR-40  ] and that currently the main concern for DIV access is for [MISC UNSC  ] reporting responsibilities , since [LOC Iran  ] is at least 4-5 years away from operating the reactor . 
[PER Heinonen  ] then emphasized that safeguards concerns will grow over time and “we shouldn’t tolerate this [MISC Iranian  ] behavior too long.” [LOC Germany  ] asked about the status of the [ORG Heavy Water Production Plant  ] ( [ORG HWPP  ] ) , which will support the [MISC IR-40  ] reactor , and [PER Heinonen  ] said the [ORG IAEA  ] was as “equally blind” about the operational status of the [ORG HWPP  ] , but he did not think [LOC Iran  ] currently was producing high quality heavy water. <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( C ) Responding to Germany’s question about the status of the uranium metal production line at the [ORG UCF  ] , [PER Heinonen  ] explained that [LOC Iran  ] has yet to test that process at the [ORG UCF  ] , although all the equipment is installed . 
[PER Heinonen  ] also stated that [LOC Iran  ] could not produce [ORG HEU  ] metal at the [ORG UCF  ] with the current set-up and safeguards , as different equipment would be required to make [ORG HEU  ] metal . 
[LOC France  ] asked why the uranium metal document is under seal in [LOC Iran  ] and not in [LOC Vienna  ] . 
[PER Heinonen  ] replied that the [ORG IAEA  ] has asked to move the document to [LOC Vienna  ] , but [LOC Iran  ] has yet to turn the document over to the [ORG IAEA  ] . 
The [LOC U.K.  ] asked about [MISC Iran’s  ] time scale for converting the low enriched UF6 into UO2--for reactor fuel--at the [ORG UCF  ] . 
[PER Heinonen  ] said that there was little work left for [LOC Iran  ] to complete on that process , but all low enriched UF6 remains at [LOC Natanz  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
( C ) [LOC China  ] inquired about how many centrifuge components and raw material for component manufacturing [LOC Iran  ] currently has . 
[PER Heinonen  ] explained the [MISC IAEA’s  ] knowledge regarding [MISC Iran’s  ] component manufacturing and materials capabilities had diminished since the suspension agreement and [ORG AP  ] were no longer in place . 
He said that before the [ORG IAEA  ] lost access in 2007 , [LOC Iran  ] had enough components for approximately 10,000 [MISC IR-1  ] centrifuges . 
He remarked that during his January 2008 visit to [LOC Kalaye Electric  ] , he discovered that [LOC Iran  ] was actively reverse engineering components for more advance centrifuges . 
Also at that time [ORG Atomic Energy Organization of Iran  ] ( [ORG AEOI  ] ) head [PER Aqazadeh  ] claimed that [LOC Iran  ] was self-sufficient in making the high-strength aluminum alloy , maraging steel and magnets it needs for centrifuges . 
[PER Heinonen  ] commented that he did not think the maraging steel the [ORG IAEA  ] had previously seen in [LOC Iran  ] was appropriate for use in producing [MISC IR-2  ] centrifuges . 
He also noted that [LOC Iran  ] would need a source of carbon fiber to build composite centrifuges and he had no idea where that carbon fiber would come from . 
He described maraging steel and carbon fiber as possible “bottlenecks” in the [MISC Iranian  ] centrifuge program . 
[PER Heinonen  ] further stated that he believes that the [MISC Iranians  ] have come to realize that the [MISC IR-1  ] is not the “ultimate solution” and he believes that the “IR-2 is the future” . 
He also noted that the [MISC IR-2  ] and the [ORG IR-3  ] have approximately the same dimensions but are constructed of different materials . 
He stated that the [MISC IR-2  ] and the [ORG IR-3  ] appear to be subcritical machines and approximately half the height of the [MISC P-2  ] , but the same diameter . 
He further believes one to be maraging steel and the other to involve carbon composite. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par29' href='#par29'>¶</a>29 . 
( C ) The [LOC U.S.  ] delegation believed this meeting worthwhile as a means for engaging [MISC Russian  ] and [MISC Chinese  ] experts on the technical facts of the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear program , facts that we hope will be accurately reported to more senior officials in [LOC Moscow  ] and [LOC Beijing  ] . 
Specifically , the meeting again provided a relatively depoliticized forum for experts to hear the details regarding [ORG IAEA  ] interactions with [LOC Iran  ] . 
Perhaps most valuable on this from was [ORG Heinonen’s  ] clear statement that [LOC Iran  ] already has the option for all the “access” it needs to PMD documents and “we shouldn’t tolerate this [MISC Iranian  ] behavior too long” with regard to Tehran’s continued refusal allow DIV access to the [MISC IR-40  ] . 
We note that [MISC Chinese  ] participation was more robust than in the previous two such experts meetings , and that China’s questions focused heavily on better understanding the level of [MISC Iran’s  ] centrifuge prowess . 
Members of the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation engaged the [MISC Chinese  ] Mission and [ORG CAEC  ] representatives in an extended discussion on this issue over the lunch break . 
These expert meetings have evolved into a relatively comfortable mechanism for discussing technical issues on [LOC Iran  ] at the expert level , and convening them is also a useful optic for the [ORG IAEA Secretariat  ] to witness .
