This is a Semi-annual assessment of [LOC Badghis Province.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary . 
July - December 2009 . 
Security in [ORG Badghis Province  ] continued to deteriorate , as insurgents stepped up attacks on military convoys on main roads and overran several police checkpoints . 
Insurgents control large areas of [LOC Bala Murghab  ] , [LOC Moqur  ] , and [ORG Qades Districts  ] . 
[ORG ANSF  ] and coalition forces successfully regained control of the main route to [LOC Herat  ] and a projected force increase should improve the situation in the long-term . 
Largely because of the security problems , the provincial government is not able to operate effectively outside of [LOC Qala-e-Now  ] and its immediate surroundings . 
Low capacity and corruption further limit the government 's ability to serve the needs of the population . 
One of the poorest provinces in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Badghis  ] has development priorities that include potable water , irrigation , electricity and roads . 
There are no asphalted roads in the province , which contains the longest remaining section of the Ring [LOC Road  ] yet to be been contracted for construction . 
In the next six months , the [ORG PRT  ] 's efforts will focus on improving security and development in [LOC Moqur  ] and [ORG Qades  ] districts , which occupy strategic positions close to [LOC Qala-e-Now  ] . 
End summary . 
SECURITY [PER Small Improvements  ] near [LOC Qala-e-Now  ] Offset by Increased Insecurity on Roads ----------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In the past six months , security in [LOC Badghis  ] continued to deteriorate . 
[ORG ANSF  ] and coalition forces successfully fought back against increased criminal and insurgent activity in [LOC Sabzak Pass  ] , which lies south of [LOC Qala-e-Now  ] on [LOC Badghis'  ] primary transportation link to [LOC Herat  ] . 
The route , which had become unsafe for provincial government officials to travel , is now back in [LOC GIRoA  ] control . 
However , this success was offset by increased insecurity on [LOC Route Lithium  ] , which runs from [LOC Qala-e-Now  ] through the [MISC Sang Atesh  ] area of [LOC Moqur  ] district and up to [LOC Bala Murghab  ] . 
Several police checkpoints on the route were attacked and overrun , although a police presence has been reestablished at all but one . 
Insurgency Focused in [LOC Moqur  ] , [ORG Qades  ] and [ORG Bala Murghab Districts  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Only a few kilometers from [LOC Qala-e-Now  ] , [LOC Moqur  ] district is strategically located in the center of the province . 
Insurgents control approximately 50 percent of the district and the resulting insecurity has spilled over into the northern part of [ORG Qades  ] district and has largely cut off access between [LOC Qala-e-Now  ] and the mostly insurgent-free and pro-GIRoA district of [LOC Jawand  ] in the east . 
Ethnic tensions between the [MISC Pashtun  ] and non-Pashtun communities have fueled the conflict . 
In February , a prominent non-Pashtun was assassinated in [LOC Moqur  ] together with some members of his family . 
Several [PER Pashtuns  ] were killed in retaliatory attacks , including , in September , a prominent [MISC Pashtun  ] leader . 
In October , elders from [MISC Pashtun  ] and non-Pashtun communities in [LOC Moqur  ] negotiated a settlement agreement . 
A new [MISC American Forward Operating Base  ] has improved security in the district center . 
However , attacks along the route from [LOC Qala-e-Now  ] to the district center increased in November and December. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Daribum  ] , in northern [ORG Qades  ] district , is a center of insurgent activity and opium growing in the province . 
Opium production in [LOC Badghis  ] increased by 922% in 2009 over 2008 ( from 587 to 5,411 hectares ) due in part to favorable weather conditions . 
There is no provincial eradication program . 
In October , a joint [MISC Afghan-American  ] counternarcotics operation destroyed an opium production facility in [LOC Daribum  ] . 
A helicopter involved in the operation crashed , killing ten [MISC Americans  ] . 
Although insurgent activity is concentrated in the north of the district , it occasionally threatens the district center . 
In December , insurgents took control of the town of [LOC Langar  ] and its police checkpoint only seven kilometers north of [ORG Qades  ] center . 
[ORG ANSF  ] and local [MISC Tajik  ] militia took back the town the following day. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) [LOC Bala Murghab  ] district in the north remains almost entirely controlled by the insurgency , other than a small area under [LOC GIRoA  ] and coalition control in [LOC Bala Murghab  ] center ( see Reftel B ) . 
In November , two [MISC American  ] soldiers drowned in the [LOC Bala Murghab River  ] . 
The operation to recover their bodies provoked attacks by insurgents . 
Seven [ORG ANSF  ] and approximately ten insurgents died in the fighting , until a ceasefire was negotiated to permit the search to continue . 
The 4/82nd and the [ORG PRT  ] are supporting several reconstruction and development projects in the district center . 
Increased Security Forces Offer [MISC Long-Term  ] Hope ------------------------------------ [LOC KABUL  ] 00000102 002 OF 004 <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The imminent arrival of additional [ORG ANSF  ] and coalition forces should have a positive impact on security . 
In December , [ORG U.S. Special Forces  ] began deployment of a [ORG Marine Special Operations Command  ] unit in [LOC Bala Murghab  ] . 
Also in December , [LOC Spain  ] announced that it would send an additional 500 troops to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , most of who will be positioned in [LOC Badghis  ] . 
Although plans are not yet final , it is expected that the additional troops will likely train and mentor [ORG ANSF  ] as their primary mission . 
An additional ANA brigade may also be assigned to the province . 
A Focused [ORG District Development  ] ( [ORG FDD  ] ) training program for [ORG ANP  ] is underway for [LOC Moqur  ] district and is scheduled for [MISC Qala-e-Naw  ] and [ORG Qades  ] . 
The [LOC Badghis  ] [ORG ANP  ] Chief , General [PER Sami  ] , plans to undertake additional hiring campaigns to support the [ORG FDD  ] programs once the current [ORG ANP  ] hiring freeze is lifted . 
Governance Corrupt and [ORG Untrained  ] , [ORG Provincial Government Doesn't Deliver  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Governance in [LOC Badghis  ] is hampered by corruption and a lack of capable personnel . 
There is no university or higher education in the province , with the exception of a teacher 's training college . 
[LOC Badghis'  ] isolation and poverty make it difficult to attract qualified staff from outside . 
The provincial government is dominated almost completely by non-Pashtuns primarily from [LOC Qala-e-Now  ] , [PER Ab Kamari  ] and [ORG Qadis  ] districts , where there is a longer tradition of education and governance . 
The lack of [PER Pashtuns  ] in the government reduces its effectiveness and outreach in insecure districts such as [LOC Bala Murghab  ] and [LOC Moqur  ] , where there are large [MISC Pashtun  ] populations . 
An important positive step for governance has been the opening of a [ORG Civil Service Training Center  ] in [LOC Badghis  ] from a partnership between the [LOC Afghanistan  ] Independent [ORG Administrative Reform  ] and [ORG Civil Service Commission  ] , [ORG USAID  ] and the [MISC Spanish  ] development agency , [ORG AECID  ] . 
Now conducting its second six-month training course , the Center will have trained 240 students from a variety of provincial directorates in basic [MISC English  ] , computer usage and management. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In July 2009 , a case initiated by the [ORG Anti-Corruption Unit of the Attorney General 's Office  ] involving corruption charges against former Governor [PER Naseri  ] and 15 other individuals ( see Reftel A ) was suspended apparently for political motives . 
However , the [PER Attorney General  ] continues to pursue the case in [LOC Kabul  ] , including bringing Governor Nasery in for questioning in December . 
In October 2009 , [ORG UNAMA  ] received reliable reports that the provincial prosecutor 's office and the chief of the provincial court were colluding to dismiss the charges entirely . 
Although [PER Naseri  ] was recently questioned by the [MISC Afghan  ] [PER Attorney General  ] 's office , most people in [LOC Badghis  ] believe that political pressure from President [PER Karzai  ] will sink the case. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) The [ORG Provincial Court  ] was recently strengthened by the assignment of ten new judges . 
However , due to the security situation , there are no judges working in [LOC Bala Murghab  ] and only a part-time judge assigned to [LOC Moqur  ] . 
Two judges assigned to work in [ORG Qades  ] district have refused to go to the district , citing insecurity . 
The Chief of the [ORG Provincial Court  ] has requested that the [ORG Supreme Court  ] assign another , more experienced judge to the district . 
Mixed Leadership at the Top --------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Governor Delbar [PER Jan Arman  ] was transferred to [LOC Badghis  ] in March 2009 . 
He has shown himself to be an active leader , visiting more districts than his predecessor and reaching out to local leaders to resolve issues . 
[PER Arman  ] , a [MISC Pashtun  ] from [LOC Khost  ] , was involved in the successful reconciliation efforts between the [MISC Tajik  ] and [MISC Pashtun  ] communities in [LOC Moqur  ] district . 
The sub-governor , [PER Amir Ghani Saberi  ] , is a [MISC Tajik  ] from the [ORG Qadis  ] district . 
Well-connected in the province , he is willing to visit districts and increase government visibility . 
However , his strong local ties limit his ability to serve as a neutral arbiter in ethnic disputes. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The former [ORG Provincial Council  ] was largely inactive . 
All but three failed to win reelection in August 2009 . 
The new Council , not yet sworn in , has no [MISC Pashtun  ] members even though [PER Pashtuns  ] comprise about 40% of the population . 
( A [MISC Pashtun  ] came in second in the preliminary results ; however , many of the votes he received were later disqualified for fraud . 
) Four of the nine council members hail from [LOC Jawand  ] district , although the population of that district is only one-sixth of the population of [LOC Badghis.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In the presidential elections , [PER Dr. Abdullah  ] carried [LOC Badghis  ] province by more than two-to-one over President [PER Karzai  ] . 
In the predominantly non-Pashtun districts of [MISC Qala-e-Naw  ] , [ORG Qadis  ] , [ORG Ab KABUL  ] 00000102 003 OF 004 [PER Kamari  ] and [LOC Jawand  ] , voters cast their ballots in overwhelming numbers for [PER Dr. Abdullah  ] . 
In ethnically-divided [LOC Moqur  ] district , the turnout was low and a majority of those participating voted for President [PER Karzai  ] . 
Only eight polling centers opened in [LOC Bala Murghab  ] , where [PER Karzai  ] won overwhelmingly . 
The number of votes cast in [LOC Bala Murghab  ] did not square with the State [ORG PRT  ] representatives on-the-ground observations , suggesting ballot box stuffing may have occurred . 
The complete lack of national or international observers in [LOC Jawand  ] , coupled with the lack of [ORG ANSF  ] personnel at many of its 37 polling centers , also made those results suspect . 
The [ORG IEC  ] recounted 13 ballot boxes from [LOC Bala Murghab  ] , [PER Ab Kamari  ] , [LOC Jawand  ] and [LOC Qades  ] , resulting in changes to the final tally , including the elimination of one [ORG Provincial Council  ] candidate from the list of winners . 
DEVELOPMENT <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( U ) One of the poorest provinces in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Badghis  ] has development priorities that include potable water , water storage and irrigation systems , electricity and completion of the [LOC Ring Road  ] . 
Although the [LOC Bala Murghab  ] district in the north is supplied year round with water from the [LOC Bala Murghab River  ] , the south of the province suffers from a shortage of water and has limited infrastructure to collect rain and snowmelt for use in the arid summer months . 
[LOC Qala-e-Now  ] city and [LOC Jawand  ] center are the only two places in [LOC Badghis  ] with an electricity grid . 
Electricity in [LOC Qala-e-Now  ] is supplied by diesel generators . 
The [ORG Asian Development Bank  ] is currently considering funding a proposal to build a 30-kilometer electrical transmission line from [LOC Turkmenistan  ] to [LOC Qala-e-Now  ] ; however , the high cost of the project versus the small number of people benefited may make it unfeasible. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Completing the [LOC Ring Road  ] is critical to the economic development and security of [LOC Badghis  ] and has implications for inter-regional trade . 
Construction in the north reaching to [LOC Bala Murghab  ] stalled in the [LOC Gormach  ] district of [LOC Faryab  ] ( formerly a district of [LOC Badghis  ] ) due to security problems . 
In early November , the [ORG Asian Development Bank  ] ( [ORG ADB  ] ) fired the contractor for nonperformance . 
The longest stretch of the [LOC Ring Road  ] in the province , from south of [LOC Qala-e-Now  ] to [LOC Bala Murghab  ] , has yet to be contracted for construction . 
The proposed route would run through the [LOC Bala Murghab  ] valley , where most of the population lives but which is largely insurgent-controlled . 
The [ORG ADB  ] is discussing with the [ORG U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  ] ( [ORG USACE  ] ) the possibility of sole sourcing the construction of this last stretch ( as well as the uncompleted portion in [LOC Faryab  ] ) . 
The ADB/USACE project is estimated to cost approximately $340 million and may take up to four years to complete , given the rough terrain and security problems along much of the route. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( U ) [ORG USAID  ] 's [LOC Local Government  ] and [ORG Community Development  ] ( [ORG LGCD  ] ) program began operations in the province in November . 
The implementer , DAI , has already established an office in [LOC Qala-e-Now  ] and is identifying projects in [LOC Moqur  ] , [LOC Qades  ] and [LOC Bala Murghab  ] districts . 
[ORG USAID  ] has also increased its programming presence in [LOC Badghis  ] over the past six months , starting major wheat seed distribution , agricultural supply-chain improvements , large-scale cash-for-work programs and instituting the [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Civilian Assistance Program  ] ( [ORG Leahy Program  ] ) . 
These programs will continue well into this year , with a special emphasis on Muqor and [PER Qades RHTQwsQfjQQQocuments  ] to al-Hol , and we have advocated for them to be left alone pending another option like resettlement , [PER Dubini  ] explained. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Vice Foreign Minister [PER Faisal al-Miqdad  ] praised the closure of al-Tanf camp in a January 9 meeting with [PER Staffdel Marcus  ] ( reftel ) , and told us he was supportive of efforts to resettle the [MISC Palestinian  ] refugees to third countries . 
However , he said the [ORG SARG  ] was wary of [MISC Iraqi Palestinian  ] refugees who had blended into cities like [LOC Damascus  ] . 
[PER Miqdad  ] related that the [ORG SARG  ] must be careful not to appear too welcoming of the remaining [MISC Iraqi  ] [MISC Palestinians  ] in [LOC Syria  ] for fear of attracting [MISC Palestinians  ] still living in [LOC Baghdad  ] . 
There are over 10,000 [MISC Palestinians  ] still sitting in [LOC Baghdad  ] , and they are watching to see what we do , he said . 
Having successfully closed al-Tanf , [PER Miqdad  ] added the [ORG SARG  ] did not want to do anything that might attract additional [MISC Palestinian  ] refugees. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Miqdad  ] stressed the [ORG SARG  ] is not interested in another wave of [MISC Palestinian  ] refugees from [LOC Iraq  ] given the nearly 500,000 [MISC Palestinian  ] refugees already living in [LOC Syria  ] . 
He added , however , that the [ORG SARG  ] would not force them back and would seek a humanitarian solution . 
[PER Miqdad  ] harshly criticized the [MISC Iraqi  ] government for not doing enough to assist [MISC Iraqi  ] refugees , and stated the [ORG SARG  ] is waiting for upcoming [MISC Iraqi  ] parliamentary elections to send a big signal that change and reconciliation would come to [LOC Iraq  ] , allowing [ORG KABUL  ] 00000102 004.2 OF 004 presence . 
The [ORG PRT  ] 's strategy for the medium-term focuses on the [LOC Moqur  ] and [LOC Qades  ] districts , bringing quick impact projects ( particularly through the [ORG LGCD  ] program ) and identifying more long-term development opportunities . 
In addition , the [ORG PRT  ] is working with the [ORG ANSF  ] to reinforce security outposts in key sites , such as Langar in [LOC Qades  ] district . 
Increased government services and better security in these ethnically-mixed districts can offer their [MISC Pashtun  ] communities a viable alternative to the [ORG Taliban  ] . 
A long-term objective is to pursue development and governance projects in [LOC Bala Murghab  ] district as the security situation there stabilizes . 
However , presently there are insufficient security forces in the province to control this isolated valley .
