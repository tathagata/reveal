( [ORG SBU  ] ) In response to delivery of [ORG USG  ] non-paper on [ORG U.S. Ballistic Missile Defense in Europe  ] , [MISC Czech  ] [ORG MFA Political  ] Director [PER Ivo Sramek  ] noted that he is pleased that we are having an ongoing dialogue and that we are all examining ways to advance [MISC U.S.-Czech  ] strategic collaboration . 
He did not have substantive comments on the paper on October 1 , although he noted that the [ORG MFA  ] is collaborating with the [ORG MoD  ] to flesh out the September 17 paper " Beyond the [ORG Missile Defense Review  ] - [ORG The Way Forward in Strategic Cooperation  ] . 
" [PER Sramek  ] noted that this coming paper will add greater detail and specificity to the original paper the [MISC Czechs  ] handed over . 
He also noted that he would be discussing it on October 2 with [ORG FM Kohout  ] and that they hope to be able to provide it to us early next week . 
He noted that the approach in this coming paper is in keeping with the [MISC Kohout-S  ] dialogue in [LOC New York  ] on the [MISC UNGA  ] margins , where the Secretary encouraged the [MISC Czechs  ] to " think broadly " about cooperation and not simply to focus on military cooperation. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Following this meeting , [ORG MFA Political  ] Director [PER Ivan Pocuch  ] told emboff that within the [ORG MFA  ] and [ORG MoD  ] this paper was ready last week to hand over and that it was quite detailed and focused on the strategic relationship . 
This paper , however , was held up by [ORG FM Kohout  ] who felt that it was much too narrowly focused . 
[PER Pocuch  ] and his Deputy , [PER Petr Chalupecky  ] , plan to press hard for this paper to be clearly prioritized and focused before it is handed over to us . 
He also stated that from his point of view it is most important that we know that the [MISC Czechs  ] wish to be involved in a substantive way in this new security architecture , however it evolves. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Separately [MISC Defense Attache Wally Scales  ] met with [ORG MoD  ] Director of Security Policy [PER Ivan Dvorak  ] and delivered this paper . 
According to [MISC Colonel Scales  ] , [PER Dvorak  ] commented on the [ORG High Level Defense Group  ] meeting to note that the first week of November was fine for the [MISC Czechs  ] and that they hoped to see [ORG USG  ] participation at the level of Under Secretary of Defense [PER Flournoy  ] .
