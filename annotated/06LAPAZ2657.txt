[PER Philip S. Goldberg  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: Following the September 29 death of two civilians who ambushed a [ORG GOB  ] eradication operation in [LOC Carrasco National Park  ] in [LOC Cochabamba  ] , the [ORG Embassy  ] 's [ORG NAS  ] section will begin supporting [ORG GOB  ] eradication efforts in the park at the [ORG GOB  ] 's request . 
President [PER Morales  ] started spinning the conflict October 2 , publicly declaring that the two civilians killed " are not cocaleros but narcotraffickers " in an effort to maintain the loyalty of his cocalero base . 
Regardless of how the [ORG GOB  ] moves forward , this is likely a lose-lose situation for it , given [MISC Bolivians'  ] predisposition toward blaming their government for civilian deaths . 
While [PER Morales  ] attempts to walk the political highwire , our role is to provide assistance to achieve [LOC US  ] goals while keeping the [ORG GOB  ] out in front . 
This event demonstrates that enforcing anti-drug laws can require tough decisions that go beyond [ORG Morales'  ] simplistic rhetoric about coca being harmless . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Following the September 29 death of two civilians who ambushed a [ORG GOB  ] eradication operation in [LOC Carrasco National Park  ] in [LOC Cochabamba  ] , the [ORG Embassy  ] 's [ORG NAS  ] section will begin supporting [ORG GOB  ] eradication efforts in the park at the [ORG GOB  ] 's request . 
Vice President [PER Alvaro Garcia Linera  ] expressed gratitude for the [ORG Embassy  ] 's September 29 offer to assist , stating that President [PER Morales  ] had decided to begin a serious eradication campaign in the park and would need [LOC U.S.  ] backing . 
At [PER Garcia Linera  ] 's suggestion , the [ORG DCM  ] met September 30 with Defense Minister [PER Walker San Miguel  ] to coordinate [ORG Embassy  ] logistical support for the [ORG GOB  ] campaign . 
Based on that meeting , NAS-owned C-130s and helicopters will begin transporting [MISC Bolivian  ] eradicators and troops October 2 . 
[PER San Miguel  ] told the [ORG DCM  ] that this crisis has created an opportunity for improved mil-mil relations . 
We are taking careful measures to provide only logistical support , and to encourage the [ORG GOB  ] to respect human rights throughout the planned operations. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) President [PER Morales  ] started spinning the conflict October 2 , publicly declaring that the two civilians killed " are not cocaleros but narcotraffickers " in an effort to maintain the loyalty of his cocalero base . 
( Note: In fact , the civilians did not belong to the Six Federations of Cocaleros of the [LOC Chapare  ] , and therefore were not part of [ORG Morales'  ] core political support . 
End note ) . 
Cocaleros in [LOC Carrasco National Park  ] have defiantly challenged the [ORG GOB  ] , saying that they will defend their coca " with blood . 
" While [PER Morales  ] manages the public side of the conflict , the [ORG GOB  ] is investigating the deaths to confirm that [ORG GOB  ] forces did not commit human rights abuses . 
( Ironically , forensic experts have determined that at least one of the injured was a victim of cocaleros' friendly fire ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Comment: Regardless of how the [ORG GOB  ] moves forward , this is likely a lose-lose situation for it given [MISC Bolivians'  ] predisposition toward blaming their government for civilian deaths , as in October 2003 . 
If the [ORG GOB  ] takes a hard line and begins eradicating [LOC Carrasco National Park  ] in earnest , the backlash from [ORG Morales'  ] core political base could be strong . 
[PER Morales  ] went to the [ORG Chapare  ] October 2 to meet with his base , and we will provide a read-out of that meeting septel . 
If the [ORG GOB  ] instead attempts to finesse this conflict and fails , it will become vulnerable to further conflicts which it will also likely lose . 
The final option -- negotiating a deal which neither comes down too hard nor caves to cocalero demands -- is a fine line that may be impossible to walk , particularly since keeping the [ORG Constituent Assembly  ] on track requires the [ORG GOB  ] 's full attention. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Comment continued: While [PER Morales  ] attempts to walk the political highwire , our role is to provide assistance to achieve [LOC US  ] goals while keeping the [ORG GOB  ] out in front . 
In a rare move , the [ORG GOB  ] has asked for [ORG Embassy  ] logistical [ORG LA PAZ  ] 00002657 002 OF 002 assistance to move military units to begin the forceful eradication of coca . 
We'll try to use opportunities that present themselves to help the [ORG GOB  ] get back onto the right track on counternarcotics , including in signing a new [ORG LOA  ] on future cooperation , and will hold out hope that the goodwill stemming from our assistance may create an opening for increased dialogue on broader issues , including democracy and mil-mil relations . 
In any case , this event demonstrates that enforcing anti-drug laws can require tough decisions that go beyond [ORG Morales'  ] simplistic rhetoric about coca being harmless . 
End comment .
