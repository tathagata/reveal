( C ) Summary: At its 25th annual convention December 13 , the [MISC FMLN  ] , without President [PER Funes  ] present , voiced solidarity with [LOC Cuba  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] , repeated opposition to " the [LOC Empire  ] , " and voted to join the [ORG Fifth Socialist International  ] . 
It decided to devolve authority to select candidates for local office to local party organizations . 
Senior [MISC FMLN  ] leadership told us December 14 there had been no change in the [MISC FMLN  ] 's stated desire for good relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] and attributed some of the anti-U.S. rhetoric by [MISC FMLN  ] members ( including VP [PER Sanchez Ceren  ] ) to events outside of [LOC El Salvador  ] , and an inability to adapt to new circumstances . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC SBU  ] ) In an atmosphere closer to a rock concert than a political convention , the [MISC FMLN  ] held its 25th annual national convention December 13 in [LOC San Salvador  ] where it affirmed solidarity with [LOC Cuba  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] , opposition to " the [LOC Empire  ] , " and adopted changes to the party statutes with virtually no opposition . 
The [MISC FMLN  ] voted to join -- as party , not as government -- the [ORG Fifth Socialist International  ] proposed by [LOC Venezuela  ] 's [PER Chavez  ] and other left-leaning leaders and declared its alliance with [PER Chavez'  ] " 21st Century Socialism . 
" In what could prove to be a significant change in future elections , delegates voted to modify party bylaws to allow local party organizations , rather than national [MISC FMLN  ] leadership , to choose candidates for local office . 
In his keynote speech , VP [PER Salvador Sanchez Ceren  ] compared leaves blowing through the meeting area with the " dead leaves of [LOC ARENA  ] , " noting the disarray and internecine conflict that has divided the [MISC Salvadoran Right  ] . 
He declared that the [MISC FMLN  ] 's socialism would be distinctly [MISC Salvadoran  ] and called on the [LOC GOES  ] to choose between socialism or neoliberalism . 
[MISC Salvadoran  ] President [PER Mauricio Funes  ] did not attend the [MISC FMLN  ] convention. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Charge , Acting DCM and PolCouns met December 14 with [PER Medardo Gonzalez  ] , [ORG FMLN General Coordinator  ] and head of legislative bloc , [PER Sigfrido Reyes  ] , [ORG FMLN Spokesman and Assembly Deputy  ] , and [PER Oscar Ortiz  ] , [ORG Santa Tecla Mayor  ] . 
[PER Gonzalez  ] stated categorically there had been no change in the [MISC FMLN  ] 's stance of seeking a constructive relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] Noting recent statements by VP [PER Sanchez Ceren  ] criticizing the [LOC U.S.  ] , the three were quick to say there was no anti-U.S. policy in the [MISC FMLN  ] and , on the contrary , the [MISC FMLN  ] and the [ORG Funes Government  ] saw strengthening [MISC U.S.-Salvadoran  ] relations as a priority . 
[PER Reyes  ] , agreeing with the Charge that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC FMLN  ] could disagree civilly , emphasized [LOC Honduras  ] as the [MISC FMLN  ] 's and [LOC Latin America  ] 's biggest disappointment with the [ORG USG  ] , arguing that ousted [MISC Honduran  ] President [PER Zelaya  ] had received political assurances of his reinstatement that had later been withdrawn , effectively strengthening the hand of coup leaders . 
[PER Reyes  ] said he believes this has badly damaged [LOC U.S.  ] credibility in the region . 
Charge noted that the commitment to seek [PER Zelaya  ] 's reinstatement depended on action by the [MISC Honduran  ] [ORG Congress  ] , that the [ORG USG  ] supported [PER Zelaya  ] 's reinstatement , but did not want to impose a solution . 
[PER Gonzalez  ] said he recognized it was much easier for the [MISC FMLN  ] to take a position on [LOC Honduras  ] than it was for the [PER Funes  ] government . 
[PER Ortiz  ] suggested much of the anti-Imperialist commentary still emanating from the [MISC FMLN  ] was , in part , a function of the party 's slow adaptation to a new world of governing and the difficulty of setting aside long-held political rhetoric. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Comment: The [MISC FMLN  ] 's historic , guerrilla roots run deep , and the rhetoric of years on the battlefield and two decades in opposition will not disappear quickly , or maybe ever . 
While our outreach to the [MISC FMLN  ] during the 2008-2009 campaign and since Funes' inauguration has paid off in open channels of communications , we continue to combat old suspicions of [LOC U.S.  ] motives in [LOC El Salvador  ] and the region . 
On the other hand , good relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] enjoys a 90 percent approval rating . 
If the [MISC FMLN  ] overdoes its radicalism , it will have a hard time sustaining its current electoral advantages .
