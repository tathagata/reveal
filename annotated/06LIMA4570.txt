( S ) This message is in response to reftel request for information on the emotional and physical health of President [PER Alan Garcia  ] . 
Our responses are slugged to the questions in reftel paragraphs . 
We do not always have first-hand information on the questions asked , a fact reflected in some of our answers below. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) [PER Garcia  ] 's overall health appears to be good . 
Notwithstanding a strenuous work schedule , he has clearly gained weight over the past several months . 
This shows ( both in press photos and private meetings ) in his slightly larger jowls and a growing paunch . 
Reports of manic depression or bipolar disorder are impossible to confirm , but rumors in this connection are widespread . 
For example , many of our contacts ( with purported first-hand knowledge ) say that [PER Garcia  ] has always been moody , disposed to sudden flights of enthusiasm , plunges of bad humor , and abrupt changes of mind . 
Many of the more damaging rumors appear to have their origins in the latter part of [PER Garcia  ] 's first term , when his popularity plummeted and the political and security situations spiraled out of control . 
According to some reports , in response [PER Garcia  ] at one point fell into a deep funk , locked himself behind closed doors and refused public contact of any kind for days on end . 
While that report continues to hound him , there are no indications that it responds to a long-standing or deep-set dimension of his psychological or emotional makeup. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) We do not have the names and/or specialties of his doctors. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) We have no direct information with respect to medications taken by the president . 
A number of our contacts have told us ( as though it were an established fact ) that [PER Garcia  ] takes lithium for anti-depression ( anti-bipolar disorder ) purposes , but we cannot confirm the veracity of these reports. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) There is no evidence that [PER Garcia  ] suffers from alcohol or drug abuse . 
We understand he does drink socially. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) Persecution , real as well as imagined , has been an integral part of the president 's life . 
[PER Garcia  ] 's father , a founding member of [MISC APRA  ] , was imprisoned for several years for his political activism . 
The [MISC APRA  ] has been the object of political persecution during [LOC Peru  ] 's recent era of military dictatorships ( 1968-80 ) , its activities as anti-regime " democrats " curtailed . 
[PER Garcia  ] himself chose to leave [LOC Peru  ] after his first term ended in 1990 , partly out of fears of persecution . 
After one year of exile in [LOC Colombia  ] , he fled to [LOC France  ] on hearing reports that he was being pursued by [PER Fujimori  ] henchmen either for assassination or kidnapping back to [LOC Peru  ] . 
More recently , as president , [PER Garcia  ] and his son have been the targets of alleged kidnapping plots . 
These experiences have broadly shaped his personal and political outlook , and exacerbated an innate tendency to keep information " close-hold , " strictly limited to an intimate circle of advisors. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) A master politician , [PER Garcia  ] has survived and thrived via the indirect threat , ably playing rivals against one another and undermining , with cold calculation , the political bases of potential competitors , including those within his own party . 
[PER Garcia  ] 's [MISC APRA  ] party is also well known as the most effective political machine in [LOC Peru  ] , complete with goon squads that are dispatched to do various kinds of dirty work on behalf of its leaders . 
We have no information that he has ever issued explicit violent threats or the like . 
While there are widespread reports that he is a difficult , demanding boss and a moody person , we have no information that he is abusive toward advisors or family. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) According to most reports , [PER Garcia  ] has an extremely heavy work load and regularly takes on too many tasks . 
As a man who lives and breathes politics , at the expense of most other dimensions of his life , he often works late . 
It could almost be said that work is all he does . 
Moreover , he is a pure politician in the sense that he has never done anything but the work of candidate or president , and it is all he knows how to do . 
( He has written books , but most critics understand that is not his gift . 
) <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) [PER Garcia  ] has the reputation of being an acute micro-manager and very demanding on his staff , even tasking senior ministers in public and on the spot with various responsibilities and duties . 
In the sense that he often expects Ministers to divine and carry out his will rather than to generate policy ideas or propose alternative solutions , he demands the impossible . 
As for lofty ideas , he appears to have learned lessons from his first term , lowering expectations and focusing on pragmatic programs rather than on large romantic visions . 
For example , he has no apparent ambition to change the world , re-order political and economic realities according to a new " vision " for [LOC Latin America  ] , or create the new socialist specimen or [MISC Bolivarian  ] man . 
The signal programs of his second term so far -- [PER Sierra Exportadora  ] , [PER Agua Para Todos  ] , the [ORG Decentralization Shock  ] -- amount in many ways to recombining and repackaging diverse existing tactical poverty reduction schemes ( including USAID 's [LOC PRA  ] -- [ORG Poverty Reduction  ] and [ORG Alleviation  ] -- project ) than to pursuing an overriding lofty ambition . 
At the same time , most observers see [PER Garcia  ] 's strengths as rhetorical rather than administrative , in inspiring with impassioned and even poetic oratory rather than in overseeing ( prosaic ) projects slowly through their step by step implementation. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) [PER Garcia  ] 's public and private persona are , in many ways , at odds . 
In public , he tends to strike the majesterial presidential pose , chest thrust forward , head held high , arms and hands gesturing in the formal , almost choreographed manner of the leader . 
He is also prone to giving long public lectures , reflecting a know-it-all and superior tone . 
All this comes across as pompous and inflated . 
By contrast , in private [PER Garcia  ] is a more informal , disarming and even considerate figure . 
He is courteous and deferential with visitors , and an excellent listener , often probing interlocutors for more detailed information . 
One aspect on which there is near universal agreement is that [PER Garcia  ] has a colossal ego , which can blind him to the merits of good ideas and alternatives that he himself has not generated . 
To some observers , while he is unlikely to repeat the mistakes that brought [LOC Peru  ] close to ruin during his first administration , the ego is [PER Garcia  ] 's [MISC Achilles'  ] heel and could have counterproductive consequences to the current government , especially if unchecked. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Garcia  ] 's attention span appears to be good , and his listening skills are excellent . 
We have no information that he has difficulty in concentrating , gets confused or is forgetful . 
As noted above , there are widespread reports of a certain emotional volatility , but it is not clear that this impairs his ability to think or to express himself clearly. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) We have no information about any periods of intense energy or activity , racing thoughts or incoherence . 
We have not noted any tendency to shake , blink or roll his eyes. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) While there are widespread reports that [PER Garcia  ] fell into a deep depression near the end of his first term ( as noted above ) , we have no information that that corresponds to a deep-set emotional characteristic or that it has recurred regularly since that time . 
We have no information about talk of suicide. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) We have no information regarding any decreased need for sleep or food . 
A truly gifted orator , he never sounds as though his speech were hurried or pressured , nor does it follow a notably illogical flow. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) We have no information about his exercise routine or diet regimen , nor any dietary restrictions due to ongoing medications. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) We have no information regarding any compulsive overeating , shopping , gambling or the like . 
That said , as noted above , [PER Garcia  ] has manifestly gained weight since being in office and is likely a consequence of his eating amply and well . 
There are widespread rumors of [PER Garcia  ] 's numerous extra-marital sexual liaisons . 
Recently , [PER Garcia  ] publicly acknowledged one of them , with [PER Ms. Elizabeth Roxanne Cheesman  ] , with whom he had a young child . 
While he publicly claimed that this relationship occurred during the brief time he was estranged from his wife [PER Pilar Nores  ] , some observers have suggested that it was much more enduring than he had publicly let on. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In the interim between the end of his first presidential term in 1990 and the current term , which began in July of 2006 , [PER Garcia  ] has spent time both abroad and in [LOC Peru  ] . 
After leaving office the first time , in 1992 [PER Garcia  ] fled to a kind of quasi political exile in [LOC Bogota  ] , [LOC Colombia  ] , where he remained for one year . 
( [PER Garcia  ] harbors a deep sympathy for [LOC Colombia  ] dating back to that time . 
) From there , he fled to [LOC France  ] , where he lived for the following eight years . 
( From this period , [PER Garcia  ] speaks excellent [MISC French  ] and has a strong personal sympathy for [MISC French  ] society and life . 
) He returned to [LOC Peru  ] in 2001 , following [PER Alberto Fujimori  ] 's resignation from the presidency . 
He was formally separated from his wife in 2004-5 .
