( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Summary: Post  ] recommends that [LOC Brazil  ] remain on the [ORG Priority Watch List  ] for the 2004 Special 301 Review . 
Despite several positive developments , including tougher penalties for copyright infractions and increased ( but isolated ) police action against copyright theft , the [PER Lula  ] administration has not yet developed a comprehensive national strategy for addressing the country 's poor [ORG IPR  ] enforcement , nor has it reduced the backlog of patent and trademark applications . 
Several signs suggest that substantial progress is in the offing , but to date there has been little concrete improvement in [LOC Brazil  ] 's enforcement record . 
Widespread recognition of the harm caused by [ORG IPR  ] abuse to [MISC Brazilian  ] artists , tax revenues , and technological progress/industrial development has increased , due in part to successful public awareness campaigns launched by both the private and public sectors . 
The federal government has incorporated intellectual property regime improvements in its 2004-2007 [ORG Pluriannual Plan  ] , and the formation of a [ORG Commission  ] of [ORG Parliamentary Inquiry  ] ( [ORG CPI  ] ) and a permanent [ORG Caucus  ] ( [PER Frente Parlamentar  ] ) on the issue of piracy and tax evasion in [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Congress  ] has generated much positive momentum . 
Leaving unaltered [LOC Brazil  ] 's Special 301 status while recognizing the progress it has made would send the clear signal that its continued poor [ORG IPR  ] enforcement is a significant bilateral concern , but not damage the efforts of those within [LOC Brazil  ] who seek tangible improvement . 
End summary . 
Copyright Piracy - Positive Strides But Piracy Still Rampant <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Several of the industry Special 301 submissions welcome the increased interest in piracy and tax evasion generated in the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Congress  ] in 2003 . 
The [ORG Chamber of Deputies'  ] Piracy [ORG CPI  ] and the spin-off permanent [ORG Caucus  ] may well represent the best hope for national-level action to improve copyright enforcement . 
As [ORG IIPA  ] 's submission suggests , the [ORG CPI  ] 's final report due in June will include several private sector generated action proposals for the federal government that should substantially remedy the lack of concrete coordinated action against piracy . 
While the issue gains prominence , the crime continues unabated . 
Special piracy task forces or police units in some [MISC Brazilian  ] states and municipalities have produced enforcement successes and worked cooperatively with the [ORG CPI  ] to make some high-profile arrests ( refs E , G , H , I , K ) . 
These encouraging but isolated foci of activity are not coordinated and exist despite the Administration 's failure to formulate a national strategy. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The administration 's [ORG Inter-ministerial Committee  ] to Fight Piracy ( [ORG IMC  ] ) met 11 times during its first year under the leadership of former federal police official [PER Clovis Monteiro  ] da [PER Silva  ] , but was bogged down in the bureaucracy of transition to the new [PER Lula  ] administration for much of the first half of 2003 . 
Residing in the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] , the [ORG IMC  ] continues to disappoint most with its lack of vision in addressing the fight against piracy . 
One member of the committee told econoff recently that the [ORG IMC  ] has lots of great ideas but no authority or resources to implement them . 
[PER Monteiro  ] notes that the [ORG IMC  ] still suffers from insufficient funds to accomplish its mission , and some ambitious 2003 plans , such as a Mercosul [ORG IPR  ] conference , had to be postponed. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Ref B notes Brazil-based industry representatives' assessment of the [ORG IMC  ] as largely ineffective , but several of the committee 's actions in 2003 deserve mention . 
[PER Monteiro  ] is most proud of the [ORG IPR  ] introductory training course now required at the federal police academy and hopes to duplicate the success of this program in all police training curricula ( civil and military ) . 
The public awareness campaign initiated in 2003 with radio , billboards and isolated television spots in a few cities will be expanded nationwide to include anti-piracy movie trailers . 
[PER Monteiro  ] insists that the educating role of the [ORG IMC  ] is significantly undervalued , and that in the long-term , this effort will reduce piracy . 
He admits that the [ORG IMC  ] would gain from improved self-promotion and publicity to inform the interested public of its activities and accomplishments . 
According to [PER Monteiro  ] , the [ORG Committee  ] 's role of coordinating action within the Federal government , including with the police and customs officials where true enforcement takes place , is difficult to appreciate , but he believes that the growing recognition of the scope of [LOC Brazil  ] 's piracy problem is due to the quiet , consistent work of the [ORG Committee  ] . 
There wouldn't be a [ORG CPI  ] on piracy if the [ORG IMC  ] did not exist , he told econoff. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG IMC  ] and the Federal Police are developing a database of piracy actions that will be accessible by federal , state civil and military police . 
This effort entails modifying an existing crime database to include crimes related to piracy . 
The [ORG IMC  ] has not yet finalized its 2004 action plan , which is to be included in the [ORG National Public Security Plan  ] , but held its first meeting of the year on February 19 . 
[PER Monteiro  ] plans to focus on widening the public awareness campaign and strengthening ties within Mercosul and with [ORG WIPO  ] . 
The [ORG IMC  ] will also be studying changes to the legislation that created the [ORG Committee  ] to strengthen its powers and expand its jurisdiction . 
Contrasted with the [ORG CPI  ] 's warm and cooperative relationship with the private sector , the [ORG IMC  ] appears to regard the industry associations with a certain suspicion , particularly concerning industry statistics on damages caused by piracy -- which the [ORG IMC  ] maintains are not credible . 
The [ORG IMC  ] is working on developing its own statistics and studying the economic impacts of the creation and theft of intellectual property . 
With the start of the [ORG CPI  ] , the private sector 's involvement with the [ORG IMC  ] has waned , but the [ORG IMC  ] invited private associations to participate in several 2003 meetings , according to [LOC Monteiro.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In July 2003 President [PER Lula  ] signed a law amending the [MISC Brazilian  ] criminal code with respect to copyright violations ( ref L ) . 
The law increases the minimum penalty from one to two years' imprisonment , levies a fine and allows for improved seizure and destructions procedures for contraband . 
The law does not include increased sanctions for software infringement . 
The free software movement is building support within the [ORG GoB  ] and throughout [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[ORG GoB  ] procurement regulations prohibit use of unlicensed software , according to [ORG Itamaraty  ] officials , but no special decrees or directives exist to further encourage compliance with international standards of copyright protection . 
Patents - Talk but [LOC Little Action  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As ref C illustrates , [LOC Brazil  ] 's difficulties in granting patents and trademarks continues to worsen , as [ORG INPI  ] lacks much needed resources and the involvement of the [ORG Ministry of Health 's Sanitary Vigilance Agency  ] ( [ORG ANVISA  ] ) in pharmaceutical patents become more pronounced . 
[ORG INPI  ] 's Patent Director estimates the current patent backlog at 50,000 . 
[ORG PhRMA  ] 's estimate of 450,000 pending trademark applications strikes us as reasonable . 
The administration 's industrial policy goals , focusing on improving the technological base of [MISC Brazilian  ] industry with special emphasis on software and pharmaceutical industries , put [ORG INPI  ] in the spotlight . 
The 2004- 07 [ORG Pluriannual Plan  ] fixes the objective of reducing processing time for patents from seven to four years and for trademarks from four to one year. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) There appears to be recognition within the administration that the [LOC INPI/ANVISA  ] linkage with regard to patent approval for pharmaceutical products or processes has taken on negative dimensions , but no remedies have been proposed ( refs C and F ) . 
[ORG INPI  ] 's staffing woes should be ameliorated somewhat this year with the addition of 108 positions now available to qualified civil servants , and officials from the [ORG Ministry of Development Industry  ] and Foreign Trade ( [ORG MDIC  ] ) expect a permanent President of [ORG INPI  ] to be named shortly . 
[ORG TRIPS Compliance and Related Issues  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Presidential Decree 4370/03 amends existing patent legislation regarding compulsory licensing in situations of national emergency or public interest . 
The [ORG GoB  ] quickly instituted the measure after the August 30 WTO Access to Medicines Agreement while in the midst of price negotiations with several pharmaceutical companies regarding medicines for its world-renowned [MISC HIV/AIDS  ] treatment program . 
The measure has not been invoked , and its [ORG TRIPS  ] compliance is uncertain ( ref J ) . 
Legislation pertaining to designs for integrated circuits ( [PER Bill  ] 1787/96 ) remains pending in [ORG Congress  ] ; [ORG Itamaraty  ] officials have repeatedly requested priority action on the bill , to no avail. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Previous [MISC Brazilian  ] legislation dealing with aspects of genetic " patrimony " or heritage related to biodiversity conservation , integrity of genetic patrimony and traditional knowledge was superceded by the issuance of [MISC Provisional Measure  ] 2.186 of August 23 , 2001 , which together with Decree 3.945 of 2001 and subsequent regulations , subject access and transfer of genetic patrimony to the approval of the [ORG Genetic Heritage Management Council  ] ( [ORG GHMC  ] ) - - a body composed of several ministries , academics , and others which is directed by the [ORG Ministry of Environment  ] -- and to the sharing of benefits in contractual terms and legally established conditions . 
New draft legislation on genetic patrimony , which would replace the [LOC Provisional Measure  ] and subsequent regulations , is reportedly under consideration in the [MISC Brazilian  ] Executive Branch , and could be introduced in the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Congress  ] later this year . 
Biotechnology <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In January 2004 , [ORG Monsanto  ] announced that it had reached an agreement with farmers from the [MISC Brazilian  ] state of [LOC Rio Grande  ] do Sul to receive remuneration for the use of [LOC Roundup Ready  ] technology found in the company 's soybean variety grown widely throughout the state . 
The [ORG GoB  ] 's position on biotechnology remains undecided , as the biotechnology bill is still under debate in [ORG Congress  ] ( ref D ) . <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Itamaraty  ] confirms that the [ORG GOB  ] has no plans to ratify the 1996 [ORG WIPO Copyright  ] treaty or the [ORG WIPO Performances  ] and [ORG Phonograms Treaty  ] . 
Recommendation 13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Despite positive strides in some sectors , post believes that the continued lack of tangible improvements in [LOC IPR  ] protection and enforcement as a whole in the last year manifestly precludes lowering [LOC Brazil  ] 's Special 301 status . 
However , we recognize a positive momentum that should bear fruit this year , with projects in the pipeline such as the [ORG CPI  ] 's final report and [ORG INPI  ] 's increased staffing . 
We concur with industry submissions that suggest that retaining [LOC Brazil  ] as a [ORG Priority Watch List  ] country will appropriately convey the importance of the issue in our bilateral relationship , and believe that this position would not unduly discourage the forces of positive change within [LOC Brazil  ] . 
To ensure that we can use the announcement to promote further progress we request that , should [LOC Brazil  ] 's status be maintained , [ORG USTR  ] 's announcement clearly recognize the positive developments regarding [LOC IPR  ] that did occur and the [ORG USG  ] 's desire to work collaboratively to produce tangible results in the coming year .
