( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] officials assured Ambassador [PER Siv  ] that [LOC Brazil  ] will wholeheartedly back the [ORG USG  ] TIP agenda item at the 59th [ORG UNGA  ] , but sounded more ambivalent on the four other [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG UNGA  ] initiatives ( Ref C ) .

The [ORG Foreign- Ministry  ] expert on President [PER Lula  ] 's global anti- hunger/poverty project stressed that the aim of [PER Lula  ] 's September 20 [ORG UN  ] event is not to win endorsement of any particular text or design , but rather to raise the profile of world attention to the subject and gain a follow-up mandate to identify mechanisms that can be pursued multilaterally , to make development flows more stable , predictable , and sustainable . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) In [LOC Brasilia  ] August 19 , [LOC U.S.  ] Representative to the [ORG U.N.  ] Economic and [ORG Social Council  ] Ambassador [PER Sichan Siv  ] discussed [ORG USG  ] initiatives for the 59th [ORG UN General Assembly  ] in an office meeting with Minister [PER Maria Luiza Veotti  ] , head of the [ORG GOB  ] 's [ORG MFA Human Rights and Social Issues Department  ] , and over lunch hosted by Ambassador [PER Danilovich  ] with Foreign Minister [PER Amorim  ] 's chief-of-staff [PER Antonio Patriota  ] and special advisor on President [PER Lula  ] 's global hunger/poverty relief initiative [PER Maria Nazareth  ] [PER Farani Azevedo  ] . 
In both meetings , Ambassador [PER Siv  ] detailed the [ORG USG  ] 's five main [ORG UNGA  ] initiatives: Advancing Economic Freedom ; Combating Trafficking in [MISC Persons  ] ; Promoting Democracy ; [ORG Banning Human Cloning  ] ; and Reducing [LOC Middle East  ] Resolutions ( Ref C ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Formerly based at the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG UN  ] Mission and less than two weeks in her new job , Minister [PER Veotti  ] was brief and general in most responses , readily volunteering that she was not yet conversant with details on all five items . 
On economic freedom , she said President [PER Lula  ] supports and has been active in implementing [LOC Monterrey Consensus  ] principles and international cooperation to underpin economic freedom . 
She noted the record of [ORG GoB  ] support for and participation in the [ORG Community of Democracies  ] , but also tentative reservations about the idea of forming a democracy caucus in the [ORG UN  ] , wondering whether that might upset the balance with which traditional [ORG UN  ] groups work and introduce new polarity . 
She outlined [ORG GOB  ] efforts to combat TIP and noted that the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] has formed a special unit to deal with the subject . 
About the [LOC Middle East  ] , she reiterated that the [ORG GOB  ] supports a balanced approach that addresses human rights without ignoring issues of terrorism . 
Finally , Minister [PER Veotti  ] noted that the [ORG GOB  ] endorses human cloning for medical but not for reproductive reasons , and that a separate office has the Foreign-Ministry lead on the issue. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) A propos the TIP issue , Ambassador [PER Danilovich  ] took the occasion to mention that A/S [PER Maura Harty  ] is shortly due to visit [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Ambassador [PER Siv  ] observed that in various nations there are many arrests of traffickers-in-persons but that subsequent prosecution was ineffective . 
Does [LOC Brazil  ] have a central coordinator for this sphere ? 
[PER Veotti  ] confirmed that the [ORG National Ministry of Justice  ] was the authorized agent. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Ambassador [PER Danilovich  ] hosted a subsequent lunch for Ambassador [PER Siv  ] attended by Foreign Minister [PER Amorim  ] 's Chief of Staff [PER Antonio Patriota  ] and [ORG Special Advisor  ] on President [PER Lula  ] 's global hunger/poverty relief initiative [PER Maria Nazareth  ] [PER Farani Azevedo  ] . 
With Ambassador [PER Siv  ] making the same exposition of the [ORG UNGA  ] agenda points , Ambassador [PER Patriota  ] gave ready , meticulous overviews of those issues and others , as below . 
-- [LOC Middle East:  ] Ambassador [PER Patriota  ] registered the [ORG USG  ] concerns about reducing the volume of motions , often repetitive and unconstructive , on the [LOC Middle East  ] at the [ORG UNGA  ] . 
He said [LOC Brazil  ] is interested in trying to help " put hope back into the peace process , " and noted that the [ORG MRE  ] has just appointed , for the first time in [LOC Brazil  ] 's diplomatic history , a special roving envoy to the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
In addition , [LOC Brazil  ] now has a seated diplomat in [LOC Ramallah  ] , Ambassador [PER Bernardo Brito  ] , a seasoned senior official known for " doing a good job in tough places , " [PER Patriota  ] said . 
An [ORG MRE  ] diplomat at the Minister-Counselor level is also now based in [LOC Amman  ] , covering [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[PER Patriota  ] further noted a recent meeting in which [LOC Norway  ] 's Foreign Minister and FM [PER Amorim  ] discussed working together on the [LOC Middle East  ] , with reference to the early promise of the [LOC Oslo  ] agreement and the potential synergy of " a small but developed nation working closely with a large , developing country " on some initiatives . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is proceeding with its previous plans for a meeting in [LOC Brazil  ] , probably in April 2005 , of [MISC Arab  ] nations , with a focus on economic and commercial issues , [PER Patriota  ] said . 
He acknowledged the potential for political polemics and anti-Israeli diatribes , but said the [ORG GOB  ] would work hard to discourage and minimize such rhetoric . 
The [ORG GOB  ] is considering inviting [LOC Iraq  ] , he added . 
-- Africa: In response to an appeal by Ambassador [PER Siv  ] for [MISC Brazilian  ] support in helping ameliorate instability and poverty in [LOC Bissau  ] , Minister [PER Maria Nazareth Farani  ] outlined a new [MISC Brazil-India-South Africa  ] joint initiative there , aimed at technical and financial assistance to build productivity especially in agriculture . 
The initiative is the first of a series for [LOC Africa  ] that [LOC Brazil  ] is discussing with [LOC South Africa  ] and [LOC India  ] . 
While relatively modest in scope , the project signals [LOC Brazil  ] 's concern about the extreme misery and restive military in the [MISC Portuguese-  ] speaking country , [PER Patriota  ] added . 
-- [PER Haiti: Patriota  ] had just returned from accompanying FM [PER Amorim  ] and President [PER Lula  ] to [LOC Haiti  ] and the [LOC Dominican Republic  ] , and he expressed glowing satisfaction with the success and symbolism of the previous day 's famous soccer match between [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Haiti  ] , attended by [PER Lula  ] and his retinue . 
The game was symbolic of the " genuine affinity and dialogue " between [MISC Haitians  ] and [MISC Brazilians  ] that is helping facilitate [ORG MINUSTAH  ] 's work , he said . 
He further noted that feelings within [LOC Brazil  ] had been mixed with regard to [LOC Brazil  ] 's leadership of [ORG MINUSTAH  ] , with criticisms of the mission having come from the far-left of [PER Lula  ] 's ruling PT party . 
The success thus far of [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG PKO  ] effort has " vindicated " the position adopted by [PER Lula  ] and [PER Amorim  ] that [LOC Brazil  ] had a responsibility to help if it could . 
-- [ORG UNHRC  ] and democracy initiatives: [PER Patriota  ] respectfully demurred at Ambassador [PER Siv  ] 's characterization of [ORG UNHRC  ] having deteriorated into a collection of " the good , the bad and the ugly , " with some infamous rights violators now using member status in the forum to torpedo resolutions and actions against them . 
[PER Patriota  ] said the [ORG GOB  ] took the view that there is good , bad and ugly in each nation , " including [LOC Brazil  ] , " and that efforts should be made to rehabilitate , not just confront . 
He noted [LOC Libya  ] as an example of a nation that had transformed from pariah status to collaborator with the world community . 
[LOC Brazil  ] would continue to oppose single-country resolutions and wants to explore mechanisms for broad " objective " reporting on problem areas by the [ORG UN  ] . 
-- Human cloning: [PER Patriota  ] noted that [LOC Brazil  ] currently has " some differences " with the [LOC U.S.  ] and said the issue is still not ripe for comprehensive discussion . 
( Note: [LOC Brazil  ] officially opposes reproductive cloning but would consider leaving an avenue for therapeutic cloning . 
However , domestic legislation currently in [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Congress  ] could change [ORG GOB  ] policy to that of blanket prohibition . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Regarding [LOC Brazil  ] 's global hunger/poverty initiative , [PER Farani  ] stressed that President [PER Lula  ] 's September 20 New [LOC York  ] event aims not for any final endorsement either of the text that [PER Lula  ] will present or of any specific financing or other mechanism . 
Rather , the [ORG GoB  ] aspiration is to raise the profile of world attention to this sphere and establish a follow-up mandate to identify mechanisms that can be followed multilaterally . 
" There are enough resources ( for aid ) , but ( they are ) not being devoted to development.. . 
Getting this on the agenda could mean a healthy increase in attention. we are trying to discuss mechanisms that exist already and are doable.. . 
We're aware of the positions you have on certain issues , " [PER Farani  ] said , without explicitly citing international taxation . 
The ultimate need is for resources to be stable , predictable and in greater volumes so as to allow for a solid development strategy - rather than the present " ad hoc and at times arbitrary funding " that impedes development from being predictable or sustainable , in [PER Farani  ] 's words. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) By the [ORG GoB  ] 's latest count , fifty-one countries , forty-eight to be represented by heads of state , and twelve international agencies will attend [PER Lula  ] 's September 20 announcement , [PER Farani  ] said . 
Confirmed interest is so great , she went on , that the [ORG GoB  ] organizers are having to think of a new format , since there will be , e.g. , no possibility for every head of state to make an individual presentation , as originally projected. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) Aside from these meetings , Ambassador [PER Siv  ] during his [LOC Brasilia  ] sojourn gave an interview to national daily 'Estado de [PER Sao Paulo'  ] which printed an article the next day , and attended with Ambassador [PER Danilovich  ] a [ORG GoB  ] memorial service for [MISC Brazilian-born  ] [ORG UN  ] diplomat [PER Sergio De Mello  ] on the anniversary of the [LOC Baghdad  ] bombing that took the lives of de [PER Mello  ] and 21 other [ORG UN  ] workers . 
Rio daily 'O Globo' printed Ambassador [PER Siv  ] 's personal tribute to de [PER Mello  ] , his former colleague in [MISC Cambodian  ] refugee resettlement in the early 1990s , in the form of an August 20 OpEd .
