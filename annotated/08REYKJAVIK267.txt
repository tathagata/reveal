( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: Last year [LOC Iceland  ] was rated by the [ORG UNDP  ] as the best place to live in the world , but the October collapse of the [MISC Icelandic  ] banking system has triggered a full scale financial and currency crisis and delivered a knockout punch for [LOC Iceland  ] . 
Now experts are just beginning to piece together what will happen in the economy here and how living standards will be affected . 
Already we have seen an immediate , rapid rise in unemployment and inflation . 
There is significant trouble with the [MISC Icelandic  ] krona and currency exchange limits have limited foreign trade on this import-dependent island . 
As a result , business reps predict 70 percent of [MISC Icelandic  ] businesses will go bankrupt in the near future . 
The best hope for the short term is an [ORG IMF  ] economic stabilization program awaiting [ORG IMF  ] Executive [ORG Board  ] approval . 
However , before the [ORG Board  ] can consider the package , [LOC Iceland  ] must secure $4 billion in other bilateral loans , and they are only a quarter of the way there . 
The [ORG IMF  ] money will continue the flow of essential goods to [LOC Iceland  ] , but real economic recovery will take longer . 
[LOC Iceland  ] must address the creditors of the failed banks to preserve future private sector financing again and the only long-term solution we 've heard for the currency crisis is joining the [ORG EU  ] and adopting the [MISC Euro  ] . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The collapse of the [MISC Icelandic  ] financial sector in October has triggered an economic crisis , the depths of which are only now becoming clear . 
Many Icelanders lost all their investments because they owned stock in the three banks that collapsed or other companies that faltered as a result of the banks . 
Those who had cash savings in some accounts are unsure if their money is still there as many accounts remain frozen . 
There has been a rapid rise in unemployment in a country that has generally faced labor shortages . 
The [ORG Directorate of Labor  ] reported in September the total number of unemployed was about 1.3 percent unemployment , the number jumped to 3 percent in six weeks and is anticipated to be 7 percent by January . 
The [ORG Central Bank  ] predicts that at the end of 2009 , unemployment rates will have reached 10 percent. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As economic conditions worsen , academics and industry experts alike tell Post they expect a brain drain . 
[LOC Iceland  ] 's semi-skilled foreign work force is expected to be the first to move away and we have seen anecdotal evidence of that departure already ; the [MISC Polish  ] Consulate here estimates that half of the roughly 14,000 [MISC Poles  ] who moved here to work in the construction and services industries have left [LOC Iceland  ] in the last three months . 
As the condition of the [MISC Icelandic  ] labor market deteriorates Icelanders themselves might start thinking about moving abroad . 
The Chairman the Union of [MISC Icelandic  ] Electrical workers stated earlier in the week that hundreds of tradesmen ( carpenters , electrical workers , plumbers , masons ) are already preparing to move abroad . 
The [ORG Norden Association  ] , an organization that promotes [MISC Nordic  ] co-operation , reports a large surge of [MISC Icelandic  ] interest in their course that teaches how to establish oneself when moving to a [MISC Nordic  ] country. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Inflation , always a problem here , is also expected to spike in the short term despite an overall economic contraction . 
Currently , twelve month average inflation is being measured at 15.9 percent , and because [LOC Iceland  ] is extremely import dependent , inflation is directly influenced by the ( falling ) value of the [MISC Icelandic  ] krona . 
According to the [ORG Central Bank  ] 's baseline forecast inflation will peak at 23 percent in the first quarter of 2009 but will have fallen to 5 percent by the end of the year . 
This sharp decline in inflation is based on the assumption of moderate wage growth , falling demand for consumer goods , and a stable exchange rate . 
If these assumptions do not hold , then inflation might reach a higher level and remain high for a longer time , something [LOC Iceland  ] hasn't seen since the 1980 's . <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Businesses report significant difficulties regarding trade and the currency . 
When the [LOC U.K.  ] authorities invoked anti-terrorism and economic crimes legislation against [MISC Icelandic  ] banks and froze [MISC Icelandic  ] assets on October 8th , virtually all international payments to [LOC Iceland  ] stopped . 
Two days later the [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG Central Bank  ] established rations of foreign currencies at a fixed price and gave priority to importers of food , fuel and pharmaceuticals . 
Importers of clothes , electronics and every other good had to get in line for currency . 
Post learned of one stationary supply store which waited for three weeks to get foreign currency to import office paper . 
The [ORG Confederation of Icelandic Employers  ] told post that [MISC Icelandic  ] businesses are facing serious difficulties that only seem to worsen with each day ; on top of the cross-border payment problems and restricted access to foreign currencies , [MISC Icelandic  ] companies' standing with their suppliers abroad has suffered greatly . 
Virtually all transactions have to be pre-paid . 
Adding to the pain , many businesses took out loans in [MISC Japanese  ] yen , which has appreciated 136 percent against the krona and resulted in increases in payments . 
The [ORG Federation of Trade and Services  ] predicts 70 percent of businesses are expected to declare bankruptcy in the near future if the currency crisis is not solved. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) For the short term , the [ORG IMF  ] assistance is supposed to [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000267 002 OF 002 provide foreign currency to support re-floating the krona and stabilize foreign trade , however the [ORG IMF  ] deal is not assured . 
The [ORG IMF  ] announced on Oct. 24 a $2.1 billion loan provided that Icelanders raise nearly $4 billion more ; thus far they have secured loans of just over $1 billion from [LOC Norway  ] , [LOC Poland  ] and the [LOC Faroe Islands  ] . 
Every day the press speculates who is to blame for no [ORG IMF  ] deal , with the clear favorite the [LOC U.K  ] . 
( reportedly blocking the deal until a resolution is created for the failed [MISC Icelandic  ] banks in the [LOC U.K  ] . 
) As we understand it , the [ORG IMF  ] deal is essential to solving the immediate currency crisis . 
The Head of the [ORG Research Department  ] at [ORG Kaupthing Bank  ] reiterated to Emboffs that it is of vital importance to establish a sound currency market in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
He said that once the krona is floated again , it will devaluate further , but no one knows by how much ; the main fear with lifting restrictions in the currency market is that of a domestic run , with Icelanders selling krona to get foreign currencies . 
This seems to indicate that currency restrictions will remain in place in some form even if the [ORG IMF  ] loans are approved. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Addressing longer term conditions will require resolving the issues with creditors and depositors and the long term strength of the currency . 
The [MISC British  ] IceSave account holders are still grabbing the headlines , but behind the scenes there are many creditors lining up . 
Post met with a lawyer representing [MISC American  ] bond holders with $3.5 billion invested who plainly stated that if [LOC Iceland  ] does not take a transparent and fair path with creditors , investors will never come back . 
This concept is beginning to be discussed in the media ; the most prominent proponent is the head of the [ORG Confederation of Employers  ] , who advocates giving the creditors ownership of the banks as a way of preserving [LOC Iceland  ] 's future access to credit . 
Most business representatives and economists we talk to do not see a medium or long term solution with the [MISC Icelandic  ] krona . 
Everyone seems to feel the joining of the [ORG EU  ] and the adopting of the [MISC Euro is  ] not only inevitable , but necessary for long term economic survival. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: The situation here is still fluid , but as the consequences of this crisis continue to play out , we could start to see the development of a permanently unemployed class , which is historically unknown here . 
[LOC Iceland  ] has always had reverse brain drain , where young people are educated abroad , but return to raise their families . 
This will likely no longer be the case and young Icelanders abroad will stay there and those who can move away from [LOC Iceland  ] will . 
Foreign travel , very common in recent memory , will be restricted by financial constraints . 
Once the current stocks of consumer and luxury goods are depleted , there will not be a replenishment to the same level as before . 
In short , [LOC Iceland  ] faces the very real prospect of the rapid undoing of two decades of robust prosperity and a whiplash-inducing return to scrimping and saving unknown since the 1980s . 
This already bitter pill will take on a new edge if the public holds to its current view that this disaster is the fault of vindictive foreign parties ( e.g , the [MISC British  ] ) . van Voorst</pre></code>
