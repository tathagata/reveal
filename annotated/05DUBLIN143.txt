( S ) SUMMARY: Amb [PER Kenny  ] met February 4 with [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
The ambassador indicated that the [ORG USG  ] is inclined not to invite [LOC Northern Ireland  ] political parties to the March 17 [LOC White House  ] event . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the [ORG GOI  ] believes engagement with [ORG Sinn Fein  ] is better than exclusion , and asked if the [ORG USG  ] would be willing to defer a decision in case the environment improves . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the [ORG GOI  ] strategy regarding the peace process was to “sit tight” and let [ORG Sinn Fein  ] find its way back in , following strong messages from the [ORG GOI  ] and [LOC UK  ] to [ORG Sinn Fein  ] leaders . 
However , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the second [MISC IRA  ] statement made the situation worse . 
He said the [ORG GOI  ] considered the February 3 [MISC IRA  ] statement “ominous” and was “unnerved” by it . 
In response to the ambassador’s request for more information on the bank robbery , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the [ORG GOI  ] information came mostly from the [LOC UK  ] and from [LOC PSNI-Garda  ] contacts , a point reinforced later on February 4 in a telephone conversation from [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] added that the [ORG GOI  ] has a “very strong view” that [ORG Sinn Fein  ] should not be excluded from the [LOC United States  ] , which he wishes to discuss in person with the Ambassador at their [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] meeting . 
( Note: [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] did not specify on the phone whether he was expressing a general view on visas for [ORG Sinn Fein  ] or a specific view on March 17 events . 
) Separately this week , [ORG POL/ECON  ] chief met with political figures active in the peace process , all of whom echoed some of [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] concerns: uncertainty over whether [ORG Sinn Fein  ] is serious about peace , whether it can bring the [MISC IRA  ] along or would be willing to break from the [MISC IRA  ] , and uncertainty over whether [ORG Sinn Fein  ] is in full control of the [MISC IRA  ] . 
Interlocutors also commented on the domestic political implications of the current impasse . 
[ORG DCM  ] and [ORG POL/ECON  ] Chief also attended the meeting with [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
End Summary . 
March 17 -------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) On [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , Ambassador [PER Kenny  ] briefed XXXXXXXXXXXXon current [ORG USG  ] thinking about the March 17 events , emphasizing that the most important aspect of the occasion is the President’s meeting with the [ORG Taoiseach  ] ( [PER PM Ahern  ] ) . 
He told [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that the [ORG USG  ] at this point is inclined not to invite any of the [LOC Northern Ireland  ] parties to the [LOC White House  ] but instead to honor civic leaders . 
When asked for [ORG GOI  ] views , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that it was of course a [ORG USG  ] decision to make but it was a decision that would have ramifications in [LOC Ireland  ] . 
He said that the situation is “tense” and the [ORG GOI  ] does not want it to worsen . 
The [ORG GOI  ] feels that engagement with [ORG Sinn Fein  ] is better than exclusion . 
Noting that the situation is fluid , he said that the [ORG Taoiseach  ] would prefer that no decision be made , yet , on [LOC White House  ] participation . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] seemed especially concerned that no decision be announced next week , given that the week will already be highly charged because of the release of the [ORG International Independent Monitoring Commission’s  ] report on the [ORG Northern Bank  ] robbery . 
The discussion then turned to [ORG Sinn Fein’s  ] visa requests for events in the [LOC U.S.  ] around [ORG St. Patrick’s Day  ] , apart from the [LOC White House  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] reiterated the GOI’s strong view that giving [ORG Sinn Fein  ] visas to the [LOC U.S.  ] helps the peace process . 
[MISC IRA  ] Statements of February 2 and 3 ---------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that the long [MISC IRA  ] statement of February 2 had not worried the [ORG GOI  ] because it seemed natural for the [MISC IRA  ] to take its decommissioning offer off the table given the abeyance in the peace process . 
However , he said the February 3 statement had caught them by surprise . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the [ORG GOI  ] believed the two statements were written by different drafters . 
The February 3 statement , he said , looked like the style of the Chief of Staff of the [MISC IRA  ] . 
He called the statement “ominous” and said it had left [ORG GOI  ] officials “unnerved and anxious.” He then referred to [ORG Sinn Fein’s  ] [PER Martin McGuinness’  ] claim of also having no prior knowledge of the statement . 
He said that if [PER McGuinness  ] genuinely did not know in advance that the [MISC IRA  ] would issue a second statement February 3 , that could signal that [ORG Sinn Fein  ] is genuinely breaking from the [MISC IRA  ] . 
While that might indicate [ORG Sinn Fein’s  ] seriousness about pursuing peace , it would raise other issues . 
Was [ORG Sinn Fein  ] losing control over the [MISC IRA  ] ? 
If [ORG Sinn Fein  ] no longer can or will serve as a conduit to the [MISC IRA  ] , who will ? 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] then noted that [PER McGuinness  ] did not repudiate the [MISC IRA  ] statement , which he implied would tend to indicate no change in [ORG Sinn Fein’s  ] relationship with the [LOC IRA.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] uncertainty about [ORG Sinn Fein’s  ] intentions and [ORG Sinn Fein’s  ] control over the [MISC IRA  ] were echoed in comments across the political spectrum this week , including in conversations with Senator [PER Martin Mansergh  ] , former government advisor on [LOC Northern Ireland  ] ; staff from the [ORG Glencree Center  ] for reconciliation ; and a [ORG Fianna Fail  ] political advisor . 
That [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and others so long and deeply engaged in the peace process would be so uncertain of [ORG Sinn Fein’s  ] intentions is not a good omen for the peace process . 
It indicates the degree to which the bank robbery destroyed the government’s trust in [ORG Sinn Fein  ] . 
Meanwhile , uncertainty about [ORG Sinn Fein’s  ] interest in peace or control over the [MISC IRA  ] , combined with the IRA’s February 3 statement , clearly has officials worried . 
The government steadfastly holds onto engagement with [ORG Sinn Fein  ] because it sees no other alternative . 
End Comment Peace Process ------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that the GOI’s approach to the peace process was to “sit tight” and let [ORG Sinn Fein  ] find its way back . 
Equally , the [ORG GOI  ] will stay engaged with [ORG Sinn Fein  ] , including a February 4 meeting between FM [PER Dermott Ahern  ] and [PER Martin McGuinness  ] , [ORG Sinn Fein’s  ] chief negotiator . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that until the bank robbery , there was every expectation that a comprehensive agreement would be reached . 
He said the two outstanding issues , decommissioning and criminality , had been considered resolvable until the bank robbery -- which he termed a “tragedy that stopped everything.” Senator [PER Martin Mansergh  ] , who remains influential in the peace process and close to the [ORG Taoiseach  ] , was more expansive . 
He said that [ORG Sinn Fein  ] must get the message to draw a line under paramilitarism and criminality . 
Echoing what we have also heard from [ORG DFA  ] , [PER Mansergh  ] said that since the robbery , there is no longer any willingness to accept [ORG Sinn Fein’s  ] argument that it needs time to bring the [MISC IRA  ] along . 
Like other contacts , [PER Mansergh  ] said that ten years is long enough and this time , all around talks can only begin on the basis of the [MISC IRA  ] winding up . 
Neither [PER Mansergh  ] nor any government official has yet defined what they would need from [ORG Sinn Fein  ] . 
They say that they will not again work on a comprehensive package only to have it fall apart at the end because of the [MISC IRA  ] yet also say they would not expect decommissioning and a cessation of criminality to be a pre-requisite to all party talks . 
[ORG GOI Information  ] on the [ORG Northern Bank  ] Robbery -------------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that the GOI’s judgment on the robbery was based almost exclusively on [LOC UK  ] intelligence . 
He also said that intelligence is handled very differently in the [MISC British  ] and [MISC Irish  ] governments . 
In the [MISC Irish  ] government , many officials , including himself , do not receive any intelligence reports . 
The tradition instead is to take the word of the [LOC Garda  ] . 
Later on February 4 , at [LOC XXXXXXXXXXXX’  ] request , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] called the ambassador . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that he would be more precise with the Ambassador during their scheduled February 8 meeting , but confirmed that [LOC UK  ] and [MISC PSNI  ] information , combined with [MISC Ireland’s  ] long experience with the [MISC IRA  ] , was the basis for the [ORG GOI  ] assessment that [MISC IRA  ] was behind the robbery . 
He said the [ORG GOI  ] has no smoking gun or hard evidence but that the [ORG GOI  ] considered it 99% certain that [MISC IRA  ] conducted the robbery . 
Among several reasons , he said that no group other than [MISC IRA  ] could have entered the neighborhood in which the bank manager lived . 
He described it as a “no go” area for the [LOC PSNI  ] and splinter groups . 
He also said no other group would have the discipline , this many weeks after the robbery , not to try to use a bank note , or provide information on the van or any other aspect of the robbery . 
He said that the [ORG GOI  ] does have “rock solid evidence” that [PER Gerry Adams  ] and [PER Martin McGuinness  ] are members of the [MISC IRA  ] military command and for that reason , the [ORG Taoiseach  ] is certain they would have known in advance of the robbery . 
Domestic Implications --------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The GOI’s all-out verbal offensive against [ORG Sinn Fein  ] has tongues wagging about domestic politics . 
[PER Martin Mansergh  ] volunteered that as much as the [ORG Taoiseach  ] is thinking about the 2007 elections , he values the peace process more and would sacrifice political gain if he thought peace would be advanced . 
[PER Mansergh  ] told [MISC POL/ECON  ] chief that the bank robbery has damaged [ORG Sinn Fein  ] in the [LOC Republic  ] . 
While not yet reflected in poll numbers , [PER Mansergh  ] and other political operatives , believe ( or hope ) that some [ORG Sinn Fein  ] voters will go elsewhere now that it is clear that [ORG Sinn Fein  ] can not become part of any government in the [LOC Republic  ] as long as [MISC IRA  ] activity continues . 
On radio , [PER Mansergh  ] made the point more colorfully: “The truth is that [ORG Sinn Fein  ] , regardless of extra seats they might or mightn’t win , wouldn’t come within an asses’ roar of power north or south of the [ORG Border  ] until the [MISC IRA  ] is off the pitch.” 8 . 
( C ) Another idea sporadically under consideration is that [ORG Fianna Fail  ] could start competing in elections in [LOC Northern Ireland  ] . 
The argument is that [ORG Fianna  ] Fail’s best way of confronting [ORG Sinn Fein  ] in the [LOC Republic  ] is to become an all-island party . 
Some think doing so could also give nationalists in the north an alternative to [ORG Sinn Fein  ] , given the [MISC SDLP’s  ] waning fortunes . 
[PER Mansergh  ] did not see this as a short term prospect , in part because the [ORG SDLP  ] has not yet indicated an interest in merging with [ORG Fianna Fail  ] . 
[PER Derek Mooney  ] , [ORG Fianna  ] Fail’s political advisor to the Defense Minister , says the opposite . 
He said the bank robbery is rapidly changing the prospective and it is the right time for [ORG Fianna Fail  ] to move north . 
He noted that most of [MISC SDLP’s  ] former voters are not voting at all , and only a small percentage shifted to [ORG Sinn Fein  ] . 
This , he said , leaves space for a nationalist party with a vision for the future , a space [PER Mooney  ] thinks [ORG SDLP  ] will never re-gain because it is seen only as a peace process party . 
[PER Mooney  ] said [ORG Fianna Fail  ] took a significant step in November 2004 when it changed its rules , allowing full membership for people not resident in the [LOC Republic  ] . 
The rules also allow a person to be a member of both [ORG Fianna Fail  ] and [ORG SDLP  ] . 
[PER Mooney  ] provides campaign advice to [ORG SDLP  ] .
