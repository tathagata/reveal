[PER Pardo  ] said the [ORG Zapatero  ] government wanted to be as transparent as possible on the sale but was frustrated that " third parties " were using the sale to drive the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Spain  ] apart . 
[LOC Spain  ] is not selling corvette class vessels to [LOC Venezuela  ] and none of the ships [LOC Spain  ] sells will have offensive capabilities , declared [PER Pardo  ] . 
Although admitting the ships' configuration has not yet been determined , [PER Pardo  ] said the [MISC Spanish  ] government deserves the [LOC United States'  ] trust that [LOC Spain  ] " will do the right thing . 
" [PER Pardo  ] hoped the [LOC Venezuela  ] issue would not be the focus of [ORG Defense Mininster Bono  ] 's May 3 meeting with Secretary [PER Rumsfeld  ] , and would not overshadow areas of strong [MISC U.S.-Spain  ] cooperation , such as [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Pardo  ] told Charge ( who was joined by defense attache and pol-miloff ) he called the meeting " in the interest of transparency " and to avoid " manipulations " of information about the [LOC Venezuela  ] sale by third parties . 
The [ORG Zapatero  ] government and the defense ministry wanted to be " as clear as possible " with the [LOC U.S.  ] on what the [LOC Venezuela  ] sale involved and did not involve , because others , such as the opposition [ORG Popular Party  ] , were using the [LOC Venezuela  ] sale to " drive a wedge " between the [ORG Zapatero  ] government and the [LOC U.S.  ] government . 
[PER Pardo  ] said he was " very bothered " that third parties have created a problem where there shouldn't be one . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Pardo  ] then complained that Minister of Defense [PER Bono  ] had no sooner ended his appearance in [ORG Congress  ] the day before when the [ORG Popular Party  ] started spreading claims in the press that some of the ships [LOC Spain  ] would be selling [LOC Venezuela  ] would have offensive capabilities . 
" This would be difficult for the [ORG Popular Party  ] to know , " quipped [PER Pardo  ] , " since the configuration of the ships hasn't even been determined yet . 
" In [PER Pardo  ] 's view this illustrated how the [ORG Popular Party  ] was using the [LOC Venezuela  ] sale and [MISC Spain-U.S.  ] relations for its own political purposes . 
[PER Pardo  ] said he had instructed the [ORG Navantia  ] shipyard not do include anything in the ships' configuration that would go against the memorandum of agreement between [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] , including anything that could constitute offensive capability. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Pardo  ] then showed Charge a copy of the memorandum of agreement signed between [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] , pointed to the portion describing the types of ships that would be sold , and emphasized that nowhere did it mention " corvettes " as some in the [ORG Popular Party  ] and press had claimed [LOC Spain  ] planned to sell [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
" I do not have to show you this classified document , " said [PER Pardo  ] , " but I want us both to be absolutely clear on what we are and are not selling here . 
" [PER Pardo  ] said he wanted to be clear: [LOC Spain  ] is only contemplating selling [LOC Venezuela  ] coastal patrol ships and oceanic patrol ships , the latter needed to patrol [LOC Venezuela  ] 's free economic zone . 
[LOC Spain  ] will not be selling [LOC Venezuela  ] corvettes. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) When asked what tonnage the ships would have , [PER Pardo  ] said those specifications had also not yet been determined , but the displacement would likely be between 1,200 and 1,700 tons . 
Defense attache noted that ships in that displacement range could be outfitted to carry missiles , regardless of whether they're called corvettes or patrol boats . 
Noticeably bothered , [PER Pardo  ] replied emphatically , " The ships will not carry missiles -- that 's what I 'm trying to explain . 
Please trust us . 
" [PER Pardo  ] insisted that the [ORG Zapatero  ] government and the defense ministry are " responsible " and will not permit the ships to carry offensive weapons . 
" We believe we deserve your trust , " said [PER Pardo  ] , adding " you should listen to what we at the ministry tell you before you believe what a [MISC Spanish  ] congressman says ( referring to [ORG Popular Party  ] critics ) . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Pardo  ] then pointed out that " something the opposition and the press are missing " is that the industrial portion of the deal , including transport planes and ships to carry petroleum and asphalt , is worth much more than the military portion . 
When asked how much the military and industrial portions of the sale would be worth , [PER Pardo  ] demurred , saying he could not give us numbers because the have not been worked out yet , but he assured us the non-military portion was more significant than the military. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Pardo  ] restated his concern that third parties were succeeding in making this a bigger issue than it should be , and said he was " very frustrated " by that . 
[PER Pardo  ] claimed that many other [MISC European  ] countries " with good relations with the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" were selling equipment with much more offensive capability to the [PER Chavez  ] government than [LOC Spain  ] . 
He then said he hoped the issue would not come up in Minister [PER Bono  ] 's May 3 meeting with [MISC SecDef Rumsfeld  ] because " we ( [LOC Spain  ] and the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) have already gotten beyond it . 
" <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Charge explained to [PER Pardo  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] is concerned about the [LOC Venezuela  ] sale not because " third parties " such as the [ORG Popular Party  ] had made an issue of it , but because the [LOC U.S.  ] believes the sale could add to [LOC Venezuela  ] 's ability to cause destabilization in the region . 
In addition , [LOC Spain  ] 's engagement with [LOC Venezuela  ] , including by virtue of the sale , could also lend [PER Chavez  ] political visibility and legitimacy he otherwise would not have . 
Charge made clear the [LOC U.S.  ] is very concerned about [PER Chavez  ] 's non-democratic moves in his own country and his destabilizing activities in other countries of [LOC Latin America  ] . 
The last thing anyone needs to do right now , explained Charge , is do something to give [PER Chavez  ] more political and military muscle , which seems to us exactly what [LOC Spain  ] is doing . 
Charge also told [PER Pardo  ] it was not realistic to think the [LOC Venezuela  ] sale would not come up in the [MISC Bono-Rumsfeld  ] meeting . 
It was bound to be raised because it remains an important issue for the [LOC U.S.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Pardo  ] replied that although he understood the topic would come up in the meeting , he hoped it would not be main subject discussed and " the only thing the newspapers talk about afterward . 
" The [ORG Zapatero  ] government , he said , has made numerous gestures to show the [LOC U.S. Spain  ] wants to improve relations , and will continue to do so , and does not feel the focus should always be on the negative aspects of the relationship , such as the [LOC Venezuela  ] sale . 
" Our decisions to increase our troop presence in [LOC Afghanistan  ] last fall , and to lead a PRT this year in western [LOC Afghanistan  ] , were taken because we are a loyal ally of the [LOC U.S.  ] , " said [PER Pardo  ] . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] government believes it should get some degree of recognition for such moves and hopes that the focus of the [MISC Bono-Rumsfeld  ] meeting can be areas in which [LOC Spain  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] cooperate , such as [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and not only on problem areas like [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
[PER Pardo  ] then said the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] is probably the most supportive ministry in the [MISC Spanish  ] government of positive [MISC U.S.-Spain  ] relations. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Pardo  ] made every effort to show that he was very irritated that the [LOC Venezuela  ] sale had become such a big issue in the [MISC Spanish  ] press , in internal [MISC Spanish  ] politics , and in [MISC U.S.-Spain  ] relations . 
The purpose of the meeting appeared to be to demonstrate this irritation and to press Charge to do what he could to exclude the [LOC Venezuela  ] sale from the [MISC Bono-Rumsfeld  ] agenda . 
Charge made clear the [LOC U.S.  ] was troubled by the matter exclusive of the interests of any third parties , the issue would very likely come up during [PER Bono  ] 's meeting with [MISC Rumsfeld  ] , and the [LOC U.S.  ] remained concerned about the sale 's ability to bolster [PER Chavez  ] politically and militarily .
