End summary . 
2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG DCM  ] and P/E Chief met separately with [ORG MFA Americas Desk  ] Officer [PER Ahmed Aoun  ] and [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] ( [ORG QDF  ] ) Executive Director Dr. [PER Yusuf Sawani  ] on December 13 to deliver ref A points . 
[PER Aoun  ] took on board the point that consideration of further involuntary transfers and the [ORG GOL  ] 's request for access to all [MISC Libyan  ] citizens remaining in [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] would be viewed in light of whether we are/are not able to secure timely access to [PER Muhammad Abdallah Mansur  ] al-Rimi ( [ORG ISN  ] 194 ) and [PER Ben Qumu Abu Sufian Ibrahim Ahmed Hamouda  ] ( [ORG ISN  ] 557 ) . 
Underscoring that the [ORG MFA  ] well understands the sensitivities involved , he attributed the [ORG GOL  ] 's failure to arrange a follow-up visit with [ORG ISN  ] 194 per ref B to bureaucratic ineptitude rather than a deliberate unwillingness to facilitate access under the terms of the [ORG Watchdog Committee  ] MOU . 
3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Aoun  ] conceded that delays in making good on previous commitments to arrange visits had created concerns about the transparency of the process and the [ORG GOL  ] 's credibility . 
He noted that [ORG MFA  ] Secretary for the [ORG Americas  ] ( U/S-equivalent ) Dr. [PER Ahmed Fituri  ] had contacted security officials regarding the [LOC U.S.  ] request for a second visit with [ORG ISN  ] 194 to clarify the nature and extent of his injuries ( ref B ) . 
According to [PER Aoun  ] , the security officials who have physical custody of al-Rimi had no problem facilitating access . 
He implied , but did not state , that the [ORG QDF  ] , which has been delegated authority by the [ORG MFA  ] to coordinate [ORG Watchdog Committee  ] activities , had not reached out to those security officials to arrange the visit . 
Stressing that the [ORG MFA  ] " wants to help " , he said he would follow up with the [ORG QDF  ] to urge that visits with al-Rimi and [PER Hamouda  ] occur quickly . 
4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In a subsequent meeting , the [ORG QDF  ] 's Dr. [PER Sawani  ] characterized access to the returned detainees as " a straightforward matter " and said he was " sure " visits with al-Rimi and [PER Hamouda  ] could be quickly arranged . 
He attributed previous delays in granting a follow-up visit with al-Rimi to feckless [ORG GOL  ] employees , whom he claimed are so poorly paid that they have no incentive to carry out their instructions . 
( [ORG Note: Implying  ] that they had actually been instructed to arrange a follow-up visit . 
End note . 
) [PER Sawani  ] noted that the [ORG QDF  ] employee who liaises with security officials on detainee access is due back from leave in a few days , and said he would follow up with that individual immediately thereafter to ensure that meetings with al-Rimi and [PER Hamouda  ] were quickly arranged . 
Like [PER Aoun  ] , he understood that it would be better if the visits occurred before FM [ORG Shalgham  ] 's visit to [LOC Washington  ] on January 3 . 
( [ORG Note:  ] The " [MISC Yom  ] al-Arafa " and Eid al-Adha holidays fall on December 18-20 , followed by the local weekend December 21-22 , potentially complicating the requested visits ) . 
5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Claiming there had been " no problem " scheduling the first visit with al-Rimi in August ( ref C ) , he echoed [PER Aoun  ] 's statement that subsequent delays in granting a follow-up visit were occasioned by bureaucratic indifference , not political intransigence . 
( [ORG Note: Visiting  ] al-Rimi in mid-August was not as easy as [PER Sawani  ] claimed . 
As noted ref C , it required two and a half months of negotiation and ultimately , in Post 's view , occurred because the [ORG GOL  ] wanted to avoid having visiting [ORG NEA A/S David Welch  ] raise the issue in his meetings with [ORG GOL  ] officials . 
End note . 
) 6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Sawani  ] also claimed that he passed copies of a written statement by al-Rimi describing the nature and extent of his arm and tooth injuries after the meeting detailed in ref D. P/E Chief noted that while [PER Sawani  ] had mentioned that al-Rimi would be willing to provide a signed , written statement to the effect that he sustained injury to his arm during his time in [LOC U.S.  ] custody , we had not received anything . 
Expressing surprise , [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00001039 002 OF 002 [PER Sawani  ] said al-Rimi had indicated in his statement that his arm was injured during his [LOC U.S.  ] detention , and that problems with his teeth pre-dated his capture . 
[PER Sawani  ] said he would forward a copy of the statement to the [ORG Embassy  ] . 
Per agreement with [PER Aoun  ] , we called him after the meeting with [PER Sawani  ] to give him a brief readout . 
He indicated he would reach out separately to [PER Sawani  ] to urge him to move quickly on our request . 
7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Comment: Both interlocutors said the right things , but we 've been here before . 
As in August in the run-up to [ORG NEA A/S Welch  ] 's visit , the upcoming visit to [LOC Washington  ] of FM [ORG Shalgham  ] may help prompt quick action by the [ORG GOL  ] .
