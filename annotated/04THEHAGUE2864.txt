( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: The brutal murder November 3 of prominent [MISC Dutch  ] film director/personality [PER Theo van Gogh  ] by a [MISC Dutch Moroccan  ] in bright daylight in an [LOC Amsterdam  ] street has rocked [MISC Dutch  ] society . 
The murder recalls the assassination in 2002 of maverick politician [PER Pim Fortuyn  ] , who , like [PER Van Gogh  ] , criticized [MISC Islam  ] and challenged political correctness . 
[MISC Dutch  ] politicians and opinion makers universally condemned the attack as a blow against free speech and democracy , but the killing also spotlighted the growing problem of pockets of [MISC Islamic  ] extremists in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
The killing coincides with changes in the [LOC GoNL  ] 's counterterrorism system and criticism of [MISC Dutch  ] security services . 
While some politicians called for tough action against those who aim to undermine the principles of our society , others warned against seeking simple solutions . 
The government urged the nation to stay calm and to refrain from retaliation against certain groups . 
Security measures have been taken and public protests thus far have been largely peaceful . 
End summary . 
The Assassination ----------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The cold-blooded murder of [PER Theo  ] van [PER Gogh  ] , as he was riding his bike along an [LOC Amsterdam  ] street on the morning of November 3 , hit the [LOC Netherlands  ] like a bombshell . 
[PER Van Gogh  ] was a well-known publicist , movie director and opinion maker ( and grandson of [PER Van Gogh  ] 's brother [PER Theo  ] ) with outspoken opinions , whose blunt criticism of [MISC Islam  ] had often provoked sharp criticism within [MISC Islamic  ] circles . 
Recently , he made a film called Submission with [ORG Liberal  ] ( [ORG VVD  ] ) parliamentarian [PER Ayaan Hirsi Ali  ] , a staunch fighter for the liberation of [MISC Muslim  ] women , about the abuse of [MISC Muslim  ] women . 
The film showed women in transparent robes on whose bodies were projected texts from the [MISC Koran  ] that are hostile to women . 
The film triggered fierce protests from [MISC Muslim  ] circles , and both [PER Van Gogh  ] and [PER Hirsi Ali  ] received death threats . 
[PER Hirsi Ali  ] accepted police protection , [PER Van Gogh  ] reportedly did not . 
The Killer ---------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) According to press reports , the murder appeared to take the form of a ritual execution . 
[PER Van Gogh  ] was shot multiple times , stabbed , and the killer attempted to behead him . 
The murderer left a knife stuck in his chest ( clearly visible in press photos ) and pinned a five-page pamphlet to his body that called for a Jihad against infidels . 
The murderer , apprehended after a brief shootout in which a policeman was wounded , carried a farewell letter. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [MISC Dutch  ] police revealed that the murderer was a 26-year old inhabitant of [LOC Amsterdam  ] with both [MISC Dutch  ] and [MISC Moroccan  ] citizenship . 
The press identified him as [PER Mohammed B.  ] , born and raised in [LOC Amsterdam  ] . 
One newspaper reported that [PER Mohammed B.  ] went twice on a pilgrimage to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] in recent years . 
He is said to be affiliated with the radical [MISC El Tawheed  ] mosque , and is an associate of [PER Samir Azzouz  ] , a [MISC Moroccan  ] in prison on suspicion of preparing terrorist attacks on [LOC Schiphol  ] , the [ORG Second Chamber  ] and the [LOC Borssele  ] nuclear plant. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Embarrassingly for the government , press reports note that the suspect had been known to the [ORG Dutch National Intelligence Agency  ] for some time . 
Internal Affairs Minister [PER Remkes  ] told parliament on November 3 that the suspect was to be found around a group of extremist [MISC Muslims  ] that has the [ORG AIVD  ] 's attention , but he did not belong to the core group . 
According to [PER Remkes  ] and Justice Minister [PER Donner  ] , the assassin may have acted on grounds of radical [MISC Islamic  ] convictions , but the available information gave no cause to assume that he was making preparations for violent actions . 
More arrests ------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) On November 3-4 , [MISC Dutch  ] police arrested eight radical [MISC Muslims  ] youths ( six [MISC Moroccans  ] , a [MISC Spanish Moroccan  ] and an [MISC Algerian  ] ) between the ages of 19 and 27 . 
During house searches , computers , books and fundamentalist pamphlets were seized . 
The arrested [MISC Muslims  ] reportedly belonged to the same [MISC Islamic  ] circles as [PER Mohammed  ] . 
Reactions --------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The entire nation reacted with outrage to the killing . 
The Queen , Prime Minister , cabinet members , politicians , media and spokesmen for [MISC Muslim  ] organizations all condemned the murder as a blatant attack on the traditional [MISC Dutch  ] values of free speech and democracy . 
Although the government allowed and encouraged peaceful demonstrations of sympathy following the murder , it also took quick action to discourage rioting , such as posting additional police to key areas and blocking off certain areas of major cities from demonstrations . 
[LOC Amsterdam  ] Mayor [PER Job Cohen  ] warned against reactions based on hatred and fear between native [MISC Dutch  ] and [MISC Moroccans  ] on either side . 
Noting that the [LOC Amsterdam  ] population of about 870,000 included about 120,000 [MISC Muslims  ] , [PER Cohen  ] rejected excluding [MISC Muslims  ] from dialogue but did call for tough action against idle youth. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Predictably , some politicians on the right immediately called for decisive action against radical [MISC Islamic  ] groups . 
Others on the left warned against taking drastic action prematurely , pointing out that there were no simple solutions to a difficult social issue . 
Politicians were united in expressing warnings that population groups should not be set against each other , and encouraged [MISC Muslim  ] and minority groups to join the common battle against radicalization and violence . 
COMMENT: ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The murder of van [PER Gogh  ] brutally highlighted divisions within [MISC Dutch  ] society . 
Like the assassinated populist politician [PER Pim Fortuyn  ] , [PER Van Gogh  ] also spoke out against those in the [MISC Muslim  ] community who , in his view , abused traditional [MISC Dutch  ] tolerance to pursue intolerant policies . 
The murder of [PER Van Gogh  ] forced [MISC Dutch  ] society to confront the reality that their tradition of tolerance does not make them immune from [MISC Islamic  ] extremist violence. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Objectively , the [MISC Dutch  ] record on integration is mixed . 
The [MISC Muslim  ] population of the [LOC Netherlands  ] grew from a few thousand in the 1960s to about one million ( out of a total population of 16 million ) at present . 
[MISC Dutch  ] separate but equal policies have left them isolated largely in big city ghettoes . 
Hundreds of thousands speak little or no [MISC Dutch  ] . 
For a long time , native [MISC Dutch  ] chose not to deal with this fact , arguing that the tolerant policy was to let migrants live in their own culture . 
After [PER Fortuyn  ] challenged this , the [MISC Dutch  ] government took on a wide range of measures to advance their integration . 
However , large groups of unassimilated immigrants ( especially [MISC Moroccan  ] youth ) still function within insular social pockets separate from mainstream [LOC Holland  ] . 
They are a prime source of recruitment for religious extremist groups , youth gangs and other criminal organizations. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While [PER Pim Fortuyn  ] 's own party is on the verge of collapse , other politicians on the right are likely to benefit politically from the frustration and anger generated by the [PER Van Gogh  ] murder . 
Key among them is the outspoken independent MP [PER Geert Wilders  ] , who recently left the conservative [ORG VVD  ] party that includes [PER Hirsi Ali  ] to found his own [ORG Liberal Conservative Party  ] on the far right of the [MISC Dutch  ] political spectrum . 
[PER Fortuyn  ] 's spiritual heirs ( including [PER Wilders  ] and [PER Hirsi Ali  ] ) argue that the failure to integrate new immigrants into [MISC Dutch  ] society is a major factor contributing to increases in crime and violence . 
The internal debate sparked by this assassination could dominate the [MISC Dutch  ] domestic political calendar , spilling over into other issues such as [MISC Turkish  ] accession to the [ORG EU  ] , [MISC Dutch  ] involvement in [LOC Iraq  ] , and domestic social and economic reforms .
