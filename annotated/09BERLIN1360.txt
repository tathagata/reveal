( [ORG SBU  ] ) Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] 's new Cabinet emerged early on October 24 after a month of intense media speculation about its make-up ; it contained several surprises . 
Perhaps the most unexpected announcements were that of former Interior Minister Schaeuble as Finance Minister and former Economics Minister Karl-Theodor zu [PER Guttenberg  ] as the new Defense Minister . 
The [ORG Christian Democratic Union  ] ( [ORG CDU  ] ) will run the [LOC Chancellery  ] as well as six ministries and have a minister without portfolio , the [ORG Free Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG FDP  ] ) will hold five as well as the Vice Chancellorship , and the [ORG Christian Social Union  ] ( [ORG CSU  ] ) , three . 
The ministerial competencies and their names remain unchanged . 
Following is a short description of [PER Merkel  ] 's new Cabinet , which was formally sworn in on October 28: Chief of the [LOC Chancellery  ] and Minister Without Portfolio: [PER Ronald Pofalla  ] ( [ORG CDU  ] ) -------------------------------------- [PER Pofalla  ] , 50 , takes over from [PER Thomas de Maiziere  ] as the Chancellor 's chief of staff . 
[PER Pofalla  ] is a lawyer and since 2005 served as [ORG CDU  ] Secretary General . 
He is known as a close confidant of [PER Angela Merkel  ] . 
As Secretary General , he had been criticized as lacking a public profile and not being aggressive enough . 
From 2004-2005 he served as deputy caucus leader for economics and labor issues in the [ORG Bundestag  ] . 
Also within the [LOC Chancellery  ] , [PER Merkel  ] 's security and foreign policy advisor [PER Christoph Heusgen  ] remains , as do [PER Maria Boehmer  ] as Minister of [ORG State for Migration , Refugees and Integration  ] and [PER Bernd Neumann  ] , Minister of [ORG State for Culture and Media  ] . 
[PER Eckart  ] von Klaeden ( [ORG CDU  ] and a [PER Merkel  ] confidant ) becomes [ORG State  ] Minister in the [LOC Chancellery  ] for coordination with the federal states and parliamentary contacts . 
Foreign Affairs: [PER Guido Westerwelle  ] ( [ORG FDP  ] ) --------------------------------------- [PER Westerwelle  ] , 47 , becomes Foreign Minister and [PER Vice-Chancellor  ] -- as expected . 
[ORG Economic Assistance  ] will not be included in the Foreign office , but the [ORG FDP  ] will also control that ministry . 
Minister of [ORG State  ] within the [ORG MFA  ] will be [PER Werner Hoyer  ] , who already served in that function under Foreign Minister [PER Klaus Kinkel  ] from 1994-1998 . 
He also was [PER Westerwelle  ] 's foreign policy adviser in the election campaign . 
He will cover all divisions apart from " culture " and " economics and sustainable development . 
" The other Minister of [ORG State  ] is [PER Cornelia Pieper  ] , deputy [ORG FDP  ] chairperson , who has no experience in this field and will reportedly focus on cultural and communication issues . 
[PER Martin Biesel  ] , [PER Westerwelle  ] 's [ORG Bundestag  ] chief of staff , will become a [ORG State  ] Secretary within the [ORG MFA  ] to coordinate the work of the [ORG FDP  ] ministries with the [LOC Chancellery  ] . 
[PER Westerwelle  ] has described [PER Biesel  ] as his closest advisor . 
Defense: Karl-Theodor zu [PER Guttenberg  ] ( [ORG CSU  ] ) ---------------------------------------- The [ORG CSU  ] 's rising star , zu [PER Guttenberg  ] , 37 , seemed certain to remain in the cabinet . 
However , there was speculation that his [ORG Economics Ministry  ] seat would be up for grabs . 
When Economics went to the [ORG FDP  ] and Finance to Schaeuble , zu [PER Guttenberg  ] 's best fit was in Defense . 
The DefMin job gives zu [PER Guttenberg  ] the opportunity to work on foreign and security issues again , which was his main area of interest as a parliamentarian . 
He is seen as a good and capable replacement for [PER Jung  ] , who was widely criticized for being overly cautious and inarticulate in explaining security and defense issues to the [MISC German  ] public . 
Zu [PER Guttenberg  ] is expected to improve the [ORG Defense Ministry  ] 's image , prestige and weight within the cabinet through his popularity and public relations talents . 
His appointment has already boosted morale among working level officials in the [ORG MOD  ] , who believe that zu [PER Guttenberg  ] will make [ORG MOD  ] a real player once again in [MISC German  ] security policy debates . 
He is a transatlanticist and well known in [LOC Washington  ] . 
He will likely give the [ORG Defense Ministry  ] a higher profile . 
He will retain the current Parliamentary State Secretaries [PER Thomas Kossendey  ] ( [ORG CSU  ] ) and [PER Christian Schmidt  ] ( [ORG CSU  ] ) . 
Interior: [PER Thomas de Maiziere  ] ( [ORG CDU  ] ) --------------------------------- [PER De Maiziere  ] , 55 , a lawyer , is a confidant of [PER Angela Merkel  ] and has served as her chief of staff in the [LOC Chancellery  ] for four years . 
He had been mentioned as a potential finance minister , but reportedly , his personal preference was interior . 
He brings some experience to the job , since he served as state interior minister in [LOC Saxony  ] 2004-2005 and as state minister of justice 2002-2004 . 
However , some of the issues he will face as federal interior minister , namely international terrorism , are topics he has less exposure to . 
[PER De Maiziere  ] is known to be a consensus builder who works the interagency process well and is a good problem solver . 
[LOC BERLIN  ] 00001360 002.2 OF 004 Finance: [PER Wolfgang Schaeuble  ] ( [ORG CDU  ] ) --------------------------------- [PER Merkel  ] wanted a political heavy weight in this difficult position during the financial and economic crisis . 
[PER Schaeuble  ] , 67 , is an experienced , strong and well established politician from [LOC Germany  ] 's southwest , who is expected to fill his new role quite well . 
He has by far the longest federal government experience in [PER Merkel  ] 's cabinet . 
Confined to a wheel chair since he was shot during a campaign rally in 1990 , the conservative politician from the [MISC German  ] southwest is not known as a close friend of Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] 's . 
A member of the [ORG Bundestag  ] since 1972 , he is pragmatic , copes well with pressure , and is known for his fierce loyalty . 
He does not shy away from confrontation and will be ready to pursue unpopular or controversial measures . 
In light of his age and his political standing , he does not have to fear any consequences for his future career , which a younger candidate would take into consideration . 
While he had to give up the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] ( which he reportedly liked very much ) , he is being compensated by running one of the most influential ministries in the cabinet . 
While he cooperated well during the coalition talks , political observers would have expected major clashes with [ORG FDP  ] Justice Minister [PER Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger  ] over domestic security issues if he had remained in the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] . 
Economics and Technology: [PER Rainer Bruederle  ] ( [ORG FDP  ] ) --------------------------------------------- -- [PER Bruederle  ] , 64 , has been deputy caucus chief and economic spokesman of the [ORG FDP  ] in the [ORG Bundestag  ] . 
He already served as economic minster in [LOC Rhineland Palatinate  ] 1987-1998 , where he strongly promoted wine-growers , trade , and small and midsize business . 
Since 1983 he has been state chairman of the [ORG FDP  ] in [LOC Rhineland Palatinate  ] and member of the national executive committee and since 1995 deputy national party chairman . 
[PER Hans-Joachim Otto  ] and [PER Ernst Burgbacher  ] ( both [ORG FDP  ] ) will become State Secretaries within that Ministry . 
Labor and Social Affairs: [PER Franz-Josef Jung  ] ( [ORG CDU  ] ) --------------------------------------------- -- Defense Minister [PER Jung  ] , 60 , was unexpectedly switched to the Labor and Social Affairs ministry . 
[PER Jung  ] had fallen victim to much criticism during his tenure as Defense Minister and [PER Merkel  ] had been pressured to replace him . 
[PER Merkel  ] , however , had to find another cabinet post for [PER Jung  ] to maintain a proportional regional representation in the cabinet - [PER Jung  ] 's state of [LOC Hesse  ] had to be represented . 
Another reason for [PER Merkel  ] to keep [PER Jung  ] in the cabinet in spite of his weaknesses and previous failures is his loyalty as a minister . 
Justice: [PER Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger  ] ( [ORG FDP  ] ) --------------------------------------------- -- [PER Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger  ] , 58 , is [ORG FDP  ] chairperson and caucus chief in [LOC Bavaria  ] . 
She successfully ran the 2008 [ORG FDP  ] election campaign in that state , where the [ORG FDP  ] reentered the state parliament after 14 years of absence . 
She was the [ORG FDP  ] 's chief negotiator on Justice in the coalition talks . 
She previously served as Justice Minister under Chancellor [PER Kohl  ] from 1992-1996 , but resigned in opposition to legislation allowing electronic eavesdropping of private residences , which was planned by her own government . 
She has a strong focus on civil rights and data protection , and has been critical of what she views are overly intrusive wiretapping and other electronic surveillance measures ( see ref C ) . 
Family Affairs , Senior Citizens , Women and Youth: [PER Ursula von der Leyen  ] ( [ORG CDU  ] ) -------------------------------------- [PER Von der Leyen  ] , 51 , a medical doctor and mother of seven , had indicated a strong interest in moving to the health portfolio and worked out that respective section of the coalition agreement for the [ORG CDU  ] . 
[PER Merkel  ] reportedly was not interested , however , in the [ORG CDU  ] controlling the health ministry in light of the necessary but unpopular reforms and increasing costs of health care for citizens . 
Since the health ministry went to the [ORG FDP  ] , von der [PER Leyen  ] will remain in her current position . 
In the past few years , von der [PER Leyen  ] has successfully modernized the family policy of the [ORG CDU  ] and thus its image in this sector . 
She is one of [LOC Germany  ] 's most popular politicians according to public opinion polls . 
Health: [PER Philipp Roesler  ] ( [ORG FDP  ] ) ---------------------------- [PER Roesler  ] , 36 , is the youngest member of the cabinet and his nomination was a surprise . 
He is sharp and dynamic and a rising star of the [ORG FDP  ] . 
He was state secretary general , state party chairman and eventually economics minister in [LOC Lower-Saxony  ] . 
He was born in [LOC Vietnam  ] and was adopted by a [MISC German  ] family . 
Both [PER Roesler  ] [LOC BERLIN  ] 00001360 003.2 OF 004 and his wife are medical doctors , which gives him some practical background for his new portfolio . 
[PER Roesler  ] negotiated the health section of the coalition agreement for the [ORG FDP  ] . 
Environment , [ORG Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety:  ] [PER Norbert Roettgen  ] ( [ORG CDU  ] ) ------------------------------------- [PER Roettgen  ] , 44 , a close confidant of Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] had also been named as potential chief of staff at the [LOC Chancellery  ] . 
He has worked closely with the Chancellor since her days as caucus chairman 2002-2005 . 
[PER Merkel  ] reportedly appreciates his loyalty and analytical talents . 
During the financial crisis he became one of her closest advisors . 
While he does not have a reputation for expertise in his new portfolio , [PER Merkel  ] obviously wanted to position many of her confidants in the new cabinet . 
Environmental issues , especially climate change , will figure prominently for [PER Merkel  ] . 
Education and Research: [PER Annette Schavan  ] ( [ORG CDU  ] ) --------------------------------------------- [PER Schavan  ] , 54 , will keep her current cabinet position . 
Even though she did not have a prominent record , as a confidant of [PER Angela Merkel  ] , it was assumed that she would stay on as a member of the cabinet . 
Transportation , Building , and [ORG Urban Development:  ] [PER Peter Ramsauer  ] ( [ORG CSU  ] ) ----------------------------------- Since November 2005 , [PER Ramsauer  ] , 55 , has served as head of the [ORG CSU  ] group in the [ORG Bundestag  ] and deputy [LOC CDU/CSU  ] caucus chief . 
As minister for construction , housing and transportation , he will have a huge budget to work with . 
Food , Agriculture , and [ORG Consumer Protection:  ] [PER Ilse Aigner  ] ( [ORG CSU  ] ) ------------------------------------------- [PER Aigner  ] , 44 , only became Minister for Agriculture and [ORG Consumer Protection  ] in October 2008 . 
She came to this job as an expert on research issues and new to the realities of production agriculture . 
In her tenure , some parts of the [MISC German  ] agriculture community have been critical of her performance , particularly her close relationship to [MISC Bavarian  ] Minister President [PER Horst Seehofer  ] . 
The [ORG CSU  ] was interested in keeping this portfolio since agriculture continues to play an important and tactical role in [LOC Bavaria  ] . 
[ORG Economic Cooperation and Development:  ] [PER Dirk Niebel  ] ( [ORG FDP  ] ) --------------------------------------------- ----- [PER Niebel  ] , 46 , has been Secretary General of the [ORG FDP  ] since May 2005 and belongs to the inner leadership circle of the [ORG FDP  ] . 
He was named as a potential minister since he made strong contributions to the electoral success of the [ORG FDP  ] . 
His actual expertise would have been labor and social affairs . 
However , that portfolio went to the [ORG CDU  ] . 
The [ORG FDP  ] sought in the coalition talks to have the [ORG Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development  ] ( [ORG BMZ  ] ) merged with the [ORG MFA  ] , but failing that , having control of both ministries goes a long way to meeting its concern that [ORG BMZ  ] development policy be in line with [ORG MFA  ] priorities , especially on key issues like [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Media commentary has focused on [PER Niebel  ] 's lack of previous experience in development assistance , and how he may essentially serve as a department head under Foreign Minister [PER Westerwelle  ] . 
Comment ------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>Â¶</a>2 . 
( SBU ) With five ministries in the new cabinet , the [ORG FDP  ] is arguably one of the most powerful junior coalition partners in recent [MISC German  ] history in terms of both the number and quality of their cabinet appointments . 
The [MISC Greens  ] had three , mostly junior , ministries in their coalition with the [MISC Social Democrats  ] from 1998-2005 . 
The [ORG FDP  ] has one more than it had during its last coalition with the [ORG CDU  ] . 
This is due in part to the election outcome in which the [ORG FDP  ] had its strongest-ever performance , with 14.6 percent of the vote . 
[ORG CDU  ] officials also describe the appointments as partial compensation for the policy concessions the [ORG FDP  ] made during coalition negotiations . 
The [LOC CDU/CSU  ] will have the popular and competent Karl-Theodor zu [PER Guttenberg  ] as Defense Minister , balancing the [ORG FDP  ] 's control over Foreign Affairs and [ORG Development Assistance  ] . 
[PER Zu Guttenberg  ] -- a strong transatlanticist -- is well-connected in [LOC Washington  ] and already has a strong background in foreign and security policy . 
There has been some criticism that the new Cabinet does not have any representation from eastern states . 
[PER Merkel  ] responded to the criticism reminding that in fact the Chancellor herself counts as representing the [LOC East  ] .
