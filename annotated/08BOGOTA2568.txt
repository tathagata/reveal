( [ORG U  ] ) Assistant Secretary [PER Thomas Shannon  ] , Commander , [ORG Special Operations Command South  ] , [ORG Brigadier General Charles Cleveland  ] , Ambassador [PER William R. Brownfield  ] , Colonel [PER Gregory Wilson  ] , and [MISC Polcouns  ] ( notetaker ) met on July 7 with President [PER Alvaro Uribe  ] , [ORG Armed Forces Commander General  ] [PER Freddy Padilla  ] , [ORG Army Commander General  ] [PER Mario Montoya  ] , Vice Foreign Minister [PER Camilo Reyes  ] , presidential Private Secretary [PER Alicia Arango  ] , and presidential Communications Director [PER Jorge Mario Eastman  ] at the [LOC Casa de Narino.  ] ------------------------------------------ [LOC United States  ] Proud to be [PER Ally  ] of [LOC Colombia  ] ------------------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER A/S Shannon  ] conveyed President [PER Bush  ] 's and Secretary [PER Rice  ] 's gratitude for [LOC Colombia  ] 's successful rescue of the three [MISC American  ] hostages held by the [ORG FARC  ] , as well as [PER Ingrid Betancourt  ] and eleven [MISC Colombian  ] security personnel . 
The remarkable operation reflected the transformation which has occurred in [LOC Colombia  ] under [PER Uribe  ] 's leadership . 
The [LOC United States  ] is proud to have [LOC Colombia  ] as an ally . 
[PER Uribe  ] thanked [PER Shannon  ] for his remarks , and said [LOC U.S.  ] assistance was crucial in upgrading the [MISC Colombian  ] military 's capacity to conduct such operations . 
He singled out Ambassador [PER Brownfield  ] for special praise , noting that the Ambassador 's support for the operation had encouraged him to proceed with the mission. ----------------------------------------- Need to [MISC Maintain Pressure  ] on [ORG FARC  ] and [ORG ELN  ] ----------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Uribe  ] said the [ORG GOC  ] remains committed to maintaining military pressure on the [ORG FARC  ] and the [ORG ELN  ] . 
The [ORG GOC  ] is ready to seek direct contact with the [ORG FARC  ] , but is not optimistic this will lead to progress on peace . 
[PER Uribe  ] said that in reaching out to the [ORG FARC  ] , the [ORG GOC  ] must avoid undermining the morale of the [MISC Colombian  ] military . 
Previous [MISC Colombian  ] governments' attempts to engage armed groups in political dialogue had weakened the military 's resolve . 
His main contribution has been to reassure the military that their efforts to defeat the [ORG FARC  ] enjoy the [ORG GOC  ] 's complete support . 
Any dialogue with the [ORG FARC  ] must not create uncertainty within the military about the [ORG GOC  ] 's will to continue the fight against the group . 
Hence , [PER Uribe  ] said he could not heed [PER Betancourt  ] 's call to moderate his language criticizing the group . 
The [ORG FARC  ] is a terrorist group , and the world needs to understand this. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Uribe  ] said the [ORG GOC  ] has taken three decisions to boost the pressure on the terrorist groups . 
First , the [ORG GOC  ] decided to facilitate the extradition of captured [ORG FARC  ] commanders " [PER Cesar  ] " and " [PER Enrique Gafas  ] " to the [LOC United States  ] . 
Second , on July 7 the [ORG GOC  ] had informed the three [MISC European  ] countries -- [LOC France  ] , [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC Switzerland  ] -- that it was terminating their facilitation role with the [ORG FARC  ] . 
[PER Uribe  ] had explained to the three countries' ambassadors that the [ORG GOC  ] respected their efforts , but had lost confidence in [MISC Swiss  ] mediator [PER Jean Pierre Gontard  ] and [MISC French  ] envoy [PER Noel Saez  ] due to their " suspicious links with the [ORG FARC  ] . 
" Lastly , [PER Uribe  ] said the [MISC Colombian  ] military would increase operations against [ORG ELN  ] leaders , especially [PER Pablo Beltran  ] and [PER Antonio Garcia  ] , to show the group that it could not continue to " mock " the [MISC Colombian  ] people . 
The [ORG GOC  ] would also continue operations targeting [ORG FARC Secretariat  ] members [PER Mono Jojoy  ] , [PER Ivan Marquez  ] , and [PER Alfonso Cano.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Shannon  ] said the [LOC United States  ] understood his decision to end the [MISC European  ] facilitation role , and agreed on the need to continue military action against the [ORG FARC  ] and [ORG ELN  ] . 
He stressed that the international community should focus on supporting [LOC Colombia  ] 's democratic state , not on acting as a mediator in talks between the [ORG GOC  ] and terrorist groups. ---------------------------------------- [LOC Venezuela  ] , President [PER Chavez  ] and the [ORG FARC  ] ---------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Uribe  ] said he would be " prudent " in his July 11 meeting with [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Chavez  ] . 
He would reiterate the [ORG GOC  ] 's belief that two [ORG FARC Secretariat  ] members , [PER Ivan Marquez  ] and [PER Timochenko  ] , reside in [LOC Venezuela  ] and would ask for [LOC Venezuela  ] 's help to locate and arrest them . 
He expected [PER Chavez  ] to respond cordially , but did not believe that [PER Chavez  ] would act against [ORG FARC  ] and [ORG ELN  ] leaders operating out of [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
[PER Shannon  ] said [PER Chavez'  ] recent comments urging the [ORG FARC  ] to release its kidnap victims and give up the armed struggle , while positive , were tactical and did not reflect a fundamental change in [LOC Venezuela  ] 's support for the group . 
He said it remains important to look for ways to raise the political cost paid by [PER Chavez  ] for his support to the [ORG FARC  ] and the [ORG ELN  ] , and urged [LOC Colombia  ] to coordinate closely with the [LOC United States  ] on [MISC Venezuelan  ] issues. --------------------------- [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Ecuador  ] and [LOC Bolivia  ] --------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Shannon  ] noted that [MISC Brazilian  ] President [PER Lula da Silva  ] would visit [LOC Colombia  ] later in July , and urged [PER Uribe  ] to engage the [MISC Brazilians  ] more actively on bilateral and regional issues . 
[PER Shannon  ] said his message to [LOC Brasilia  ] had been that [LOC Brazil  ] 's vision of an integrated [LOC South America  ] depends on cooperation with the dynamic economies of [LOC Colombia  ] , [LOC Peru  ] , and [ORG Chile--not Venezuela  ] and [LOC Ecuador  ] . 
[LOC Brazil  ] missed an opportunity at the [ORG Organization of American States  ] ( [ORG OAS  ] ) in March , when it showed more concern for abstract notions of sovereignty than for the real security needs of 44 million [MISC Colombians  ] . 
[PER Uribe  ] agreed greater [MISC Colombian  ] engagement with [LOC Brazil  ] would be useful , and said he had invited [PER Lula  ] and [MISC Peruvian  ] President [PER Garcia  ] to attend [LOC Colombia  ] 's independence day parade in [LOC Leticia  ] on July 20 . 
[PER Lula  ] would spend the previous day in [LOC Bogota.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Asked by [PER Uribe  ] for the [LOC U.S.  ] take on [LOC Ecuador  ] , [PER Shannon  ] said the [ORG USG  ] continues to urge President [PER Correa  ] to reestablish diplomatic ties with [LOC Bogota  ] . 
[PER Uribe  ] 's meeting with [PER Chavez  ] would highlight [PER Correa  ] 's intransigence on this issue and make him look petty . 
He added that we continue to engage the [MISC Ecuadorians  ] , but were surprised by the depth and level of contacts between [MISC Ecuadorian  ] officials and the [ORG FARC  ] revealed in the computers seized from [PER Raul Reyes'  ] camp . 
[LOC Colombia  ] and the [LOC United States  ] need to work together to make countries pay a high prices for their links to the [LOC FARC.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Shannon  ] thanked [PER Uribe  ] for [LOC Colombia  ] 's participation with [LOC Argentina  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] in the Group of Friends working to promote a peaceful resolution to [LOC Bolivia  ] 's domestic conflict . 
We especially appreciated the [ORG GOC  ] 's reminder to the [MISC Bolivian  ] government that it must meet its [ORG Vienna Convention  ] obligation to provide security for diplomatic facilities and personnel . 
Vice Foreign Minister [PER Camilo Reyes  ] said [LOC Colombia  ] remains committed to the Group of Friends , but voiced concern that the situation in [LOC Bolivia  ] continues to deteriorate . 
[PER Shannon  ] agreed the conflict between the lowland departments and [LOC La Paz  ] is deepening , and said it is important that [LOC Bolivia  ] 's neighbors stay engaged. --------------------------------------------- - [ORG U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement  ] ( [ORG CTPA  ] ) --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Uribe  ] said he understood the [ORG CTPA  ] is a domestic political issue in the [LOC United States  ] , and will not make public comments about the accord at this time . 
Still , [LOC Colombia  ] 's economy faces growing difficulties , including rising inflation , an appreciating peso , and falling consumption . 
[LOC U.S.  ] Congressional approval of the [ORG CTPA  ] would help [LOC Colombia  ] manage these problems . 
The [ORG CTPA  ] would help [LOC Colombia  ] attract foreign investment , boost job creation , and generate additional resources needed to consolidate progress against the terrorist groups . 
He asked [PER Shannon  ] to pass this message to [ORG Congress  ] . 
[PER Shannon  ] reiterated President [PER Bush  ] 's commitment to obtaining congressional passage of the [ORG CTPA  ] , and promised to communicate [LOC Colombia  ] 's concerns to [LOC Congress.  ] ----------------------------------- [ORG Cooperative Security Location  ] ( [ORG CSL  ] ) ----------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The Ambassador noted our interest in pursuing the establishment of a [ORG Cooperative Security Location  ] ( [ORG CSL  ] ) in [LOC Colombia  ] if [LOC Ecuador  ] does not renew our agreement on [LOC Manta  ] . 
[PER Uribe  ] said the [ORG GOC  ] considers the establishment of a [ORG CSL  ] a top priority and hopes to conclude an agreement on such a facility as soon as possible .
