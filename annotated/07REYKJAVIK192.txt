( C ) SUMMARY: Under Secretary Burns' visit to [LOC Iceland  ] on June 14 reiterated the [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to [LOC Iceland  ] 's security and laid the groundwork for new areas of cooperation , particularly in energy security and scientific research . 
New Foreign Minister [PER Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir  ] carried herself well , demonstrating she is quickly getting into her brief . 
On global affairs , attention centered on developments in [LOC Iraq  ] -- past and present -- and [LOC Afghanistan  ] , with considerable time devoted to the [LOC Middle East  ] peace process and the question of legitimizing [ORG Hamas  ] . 
In private and in public , the message came through that the [LOC U.S.  ] remains [LOC Iceland  ] 's close friend and ally . 
A lively roundtable with key opinion makers received lengthy favorable coverage in all major news outlets . 
In the same vein , U/S Burns' interview on [LOC Iceland  ] 's most popular television news show generated ample positive buzz , with some observers terming it the best interview of a foreign official in recent memory . 
End Summary . 
[ORG U.S.-ICELAND DEFENSE TIES  ] ------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( SBU ) In separate meetings , and again over a joint [MISC PM-MFA  ] working lunch to review the strategic environment , PM [PER Haarde  ] and FM [PER Gisladottir  ] noted that [LOC Iceland  ] continued to look to the 1951 [ORG U.S.-Iceland Defense Agreement  ] as the cornerstone of [LOC Iceland  ] 's defense . 
At the same time , [LOC Iceland  ] continues to expand and deepen its defense ties with other [ORG NATO  ] allies in the [LOC North Atlantic  ] , as in the case of recent defense MOUs signed with [LOC Norway  ] and [LOC Denmark  ] . 
The FM added that similar discussions are underway with the [MISC German  ] and [MISC Canadian  ] governments ; PM [PER Haarde  ] will travel to [LOC Ottawa  ] in August , and a reciprocal visit by [MISC Canadian  ] Prime Minister [PER McKay  ] may be in the works. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Both the PM and FM pressed for continued progress on issues of importance to [LOC Iceland  ] in the wake of the departure of permanent [LOC U.S.  ] forces in September 2006 . 
On the [LOC Iceland  ] Air [ORG Defense System  ] ( [ORG IADS  ] ) , both requested that the [ORG USG  ] accelerate progress to ensure that the air defense radars and other necessary system components could be handed over on August 15 of this year , when [LOC U.S.  ] funding expires . 
[PER Burns  ] noted positively the work led by OSD 's [PER Jim Hursch  ] to coordinate bilateral work on the [ORG IADS  ] issue , and reiterated the [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to leave [LOC Iceland  ] with an adequate air defense system . 
This would dovetail with efforts at the [ORG NATO Military Committee  ] to approve a plan for peacetime air surveillance and interception preparedness ( i.e. , air policing ) . 
PM [PER Haarde  ] expressed his great pleasure at hearing that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG NATO  ] delegations had made significant progress on the air policing issue , with a draft plan expected to pass silence in the [ORG Military Committee  ] on June 22. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) FM [PER Gisladottir  ] also asked for [LOC U.S.  ] assistance in two areas: ensuring the continuity within [ORG NATO  ] of the " [MISC Island Commander Iceland  ] " billet -- which the [ORG MFA Defense Department Head  ] clarified as less a request for continuing the structure of decades past and more a request for a single [LOC Iceland  ] Point of Contact within the SHAPE structure -- and the possible lending of strategic assessment expertise as [LOC Iceland  ] works to establish a cross-party institution to examine national security issues . 
[PER Burns  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] could assist [LOC Iceland  ] on both of these points . 
[LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] ----------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) PM [PER Haarde  ] said [LOC Iceland  ] 's most significant involvement in stabilization and reconstruction work abroad was in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
He further noted that the previous FM had changed the " way of our [ peacekeeping ] mission " by withdrawing [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG PRT  ] personnel in April , although [LOC Iceland  ] was still spending the same amount of money . 
Throughout the day , [PER Burns  ] expressed his strong appreciation for the contribution [LOC Iceland  ] had made in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , through [LOC ISAF  ] airlift funding , the management of [ORG Kabul International Airport  ] , and through [ORG PRT  ] deployments in [LOC Chaghcharan  ] . 
Noting that [ORG NATO  ] is a big alliance where every country brings something that they do best to Alliance missions , [PER Burns  ] strongly urged that [LOC Iceland  ] consider renewing its [ORG PRT  ] deployment , which had brought special skills to the table . 
[PER FM Gisladottir  ] described a general apprehension among Icelanders at seeing their fellow citizens in military or quasi-military roles , but pledged to continue [LOC Iceland  ] 's activities in humanitarian reconstruction . 
[PER Burns  ] reiterated the flexibility of the [ORG PRT  ] concept , nothing this flexibility allowed for [LOC Iceland  ] to shape its contributions in an appropriate manner . 
[PER Burns  ] updated the PM and FM on progress in [LOC Afghanistan  ] as a whole . 
[LOC IRAQ  ] ---- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In her meeting with [PER Burns  ] , [PER FM Gisladottir  ] drew attention to the new coalition government 's statement regretting the war in [LOC Iraq  ] , and pointed out that her party in 2003 had been deeply opposed to the invasion . 
[PER Burns  ] noted that what was important at this point is the [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000192 002 OF 003 need to work together to promote progress in stabilizing the country . 
Over lunch , he emphasized the need to put the arguments of 2003 behind us , and noted [MISC French  ] President [ORG Sarkozy  ] and [MISC German  ] Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] have both made helpful comments in this regard . 
PALESTINE: FOLLOWING IN NORWAY'S FOOTSTEPS ? ------------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Over lunch , [PER FM Gisladottir  ] expanded upon her recent idea that [LOC Iceland  ] should follow [LOC Norway  ] 's lead and recognize the [ORG Palestinian Unity Government  ] . 
[PER Burns  ] said the [LOC U.S  ] cannot accept [ORG Hamas  ] until the organization renounces terrorism , accepts [LOC Israel  ] and accepts peace , and noted this was the Quartet view . 
[PER FM Gisladottir  ] responded that some in the [ORG European Commission  ] believe the [ORG EU  ] is trapped in this policy , because they have already invested so much in [LOC Palestine  ] 's infrastructure , which is crumbling without direct aid . 
[PER Burns  ] argued that the [ORG U.N.  ] fills that role , while [ORG Hamas  ] has continued to prove its unreliability by smuggling weapons and , based on the day 's news reports , is working to annihilate [PER Fatah  ] . 
Time is needed to rebuild credibility on the [MISC Palestinian  ] side . 
Intrigued , [PER FM Gisladottir  ] asked point blank for Burns' view on the [MISC Norwegians'  ] initiative . 
[PER Burns  ] said that , in light of current events , legitimizing [ORG Hamas  ] would be a mistake . 
[ORG Hamas  ] was acting in a completely unacceptable way , and the [ORG USG  ] would make that clear to [MISC Norwegian  ] [PER FM Stoere  ] . 
[PER Gisladottir  ] noted that she will be meeting with [PER Stoere  ] in [LOC Oslo  ] on June 20 . 
[LOC RUSSIA  ] ------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Haarde  ] said that [LOC Iceland  ] 's relationship with [LOC Russia  ] is important , noting the historical trade ties and the strategic situation in the [LOC Barents Sea  ] . 
The Icelanders had an indication that [PER Putin  ] might be coming to [LOC Iceland  ] as a stopover during his July 1-2 visit to [LOC Maine  ] to meet with President [PER Bush  ] . 
[PER Haarde  ] said that his government has " watched in amazement " as [LOC Russia  ] has attempted to reassert itself in unpredictable ways , particularly in the last year and with regard to the [MISC Baltic  ] states . 
[PER Gisladottir  ] pointed out the contradictions in [MISC Russian  ] behavior at a Council of the [LOC Baltic Sea States  ] ministerial earlier in the week , where [MISC Russian  ] FM Lavrov flatly refused a meeting request from his [MISC Estonian  ] counterpart , but was all smiles and easy jokes over dinner later at the meeting . 
[PER Burns  ] explained [LOC U.S.  ] concern over [MISC Russian  ] unpredictability , describing [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to be patient and not respond to [PER Putin  ] 's provocations . 
Both the PM and FM agreed that like-minded nations need to work with [LOC Russia  ] to encourage it to integrate with the broader world . 
ENERGY SECURITY/CLIMATE CHANGE ------------------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Haarde  ] noted that energy transportation in the [LOC North Atlantic  ] , especially between [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC North America  ] , will be an increasingly important issue . 
[PER Burns  ] responded that we have great interest in energy security . 
[PER Haarde  ] welcomed President [PER Bush  ] 's climate change initiative as very important to [LOC Iceland  ] and said the [LOC U.S.  ] should take a leadership role on this issue . 
[PER Gisladottir  ] also noted the importance of having [LOC India  ] and [LOC China  ] , in addition to the [LOC U.S.  ] , as part of the global arrangement to reduce emissions . 
She described [MISC Icelandic  ] investment in the [LOC U.S.  ] in geothermal development and said there are a lot of possibilities to cooperate on deep-drilling research . 
[PER Haarde  ] said that the " know-how " of harnessing geothermal resources was an [MISC Icelandic  ] export commodity , and reiterated the [MISC Icelandic  ] willingness to work together with the [LOC United States  ] in this area . 
[PER Burns  ] agreed that clean energy is an area where we can work together , and promised to talk to the [ORG Department of Energy  ] to emphasize the importance of closer collaboration in research and development . 
WHALING ------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Haarde  ] proved more expansive on the reasoning behind [LOC Iceland  ] 's position on whaling than in prior discussions on the topic . 
He stated flatly that [LOC Iceland  ] would " never compromise on the principle " behind its issuance of a commercial whaling quota in 2006 , and that the whale stock around [LOC Iceland  ] must be " contained and culled . 
" Reflecting his confidence in in [MISC GOI-sponsored  ] research claims that whales are a threat to [MISC Icelandic  ] fish stocks , [PER Haarde  ] noted that Icelanders depend on fishing for their livelihood and that whaling should be viewed as a legitimate activity if it is done in a sustainable manner . 
[PER Haarde  ] did allow that now that the Icelanders " have demonstrated the principle , " his government may choose not to re-issue the commercial whaling quota if the largest company engaged in whaling cannot find a market for the meat . 
While thanking [PER Haarde  ] for [LOC Iceland  ] 's support of the aboriginal bowhead quota at May 's [ORG International Whaling Commission  ] meeting in [LOC Anchorage  ] ( a vote the PM was keenly aware of ) , [PER Burns  ] communicated the strong objection the [LOC U.S.  ] has to whaling for commercial reasons . 
QUEST FOR A UNSC SEAT [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000192 003 OF 003 --------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Haarde  ] noted that much had changed in the world since 1945 and [LOC Iceland  ] was much in favor of reforming and strengthening the [ORG United Nations  ] and expanding the [ORG Security Council  ] . 
He asked [PER Burns  ] for [LOC U.S.  ] support for [LOC Iceland  ] 's UNSC bid and noted that despite the [ORG GOI  ] 's success in getting a few commitments for supporting votes , he didn't know how reliable they would be in the end . 
[PER Burns  ] said that [LOC Iceland  ] would be a welcome addition to the Council but that the [ORG USG  ] does not disclose its votes in [LOC UN  ] elections . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Burns' visit to [LOC Iceland  ] , the first by a senior [LOC U.S.  ] official since 2003 , was greatly welcomed by the new [MISC Icelandic  ] government , and received heavy and positive press coverage . 
In the meetings , some foreign policy divisions between the Prime Minister and his new Foreign Minister , most particularly on support for the war in [LOC Iraq  ] , were deliberately underscored by [PER Gisladottir  ] . 
In general , however , the personal relationship between the two most senior members of the new coalition appeared collegial and relaxed . 
( In fact , [PER Haarde  ] said that the new government coalition was so stable that he saw no reason why it couldn't last for two to three terms . 
) [PER Gisladottir  ] was willing to listen to the argument for a renewed [MISC Icelandic  ] contribution to the [ORG PRT  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , although her obvious wariness of any [MISC Icelandic  ] association with any military means we still have work to do to convince her to renew the mandate before winter . 
Both leaders expressed confidence that bilateral relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] are back on a firm footing but want to wrap up the last of the base legacy issues , especially the future of [LOC IADS  ] , early this summer . 
With [PER Gisladottir  ] clearly taking energetic control of her new brief , and in a mood to travel , we can expect a request for cabinet-level meetings in [LOC Washington  ] within the near future . 
PM [PER Haarde  ] 's visit to the [LOC United States  ] in August would present an excellent opportunity for a [LOC White House  ] meeting with a [ORG NATO  ] leader who is not only likely to be in place for a long time , but whose steadiness and calm management went a long ways to taking the domestic fire out of the base closure issue. van Voorst</pre></code>
