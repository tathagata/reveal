Blome  ] , Minister Counselor , DoS , ECPO ; REASON: 1.4 ( B ) , ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Key [PER Points:  ] -- The Head of the [MISC Sudanese  ] [ORG National Congress Party  ] 's ( [ORG NCP  ] ) office in [LOC Cairo  ] , [PER Kamal Ali  ] , told us he was working with the Government of [LOC Egypt  ] ( GoE ) to organize the logistics so [MISC Sudanese  ] in [LOC Cairo  ] can vote in the [MISC Sudanese  ] Presidential election . 
The Government of [LOC Sudan  ] ( [ORG GoS  ] ) also asked [LOC Egypt  ] and the [ORG Arab League  ] to provide monitors for the election in [LOC Sudan  ] . 
-- [PER Ali  ] said [LOC Egypt  ] 's motivations in [LOC Sudan  ] are circumspect because of its focus on [ORG Nile  ] waters . 
-- According to [PER Ali  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] role has an important role in resolving problems in [LOC Sudan  ] , but the policy of pressure has divided the [ORG GoS  ] into pro- and anti-engagement factions . 
-- [PER Ali  ] believes financial incentives should be offered to [LOC South Sudan  ] to ensure unity because succession will lead to war . 
-- The [ORG GoS  ] has taken steps to increase security and provide humanitarian assistance in [LOC Darfur  ] , which led to the return of some IDPs , according to [PER Ali  ] . 
However , it is unable to negotiate with the [MISC Darfuri  ] rebel leaders because the rebels are not united and key leaders refuse to come to [LOC Doha  ] . 
-- [PER Ali  ] believes pressure needs to be exerted on [LOC France  ] to bring [PER Abdel Wahid Al Nur  ] to the negotiation table and push [MISC Chadian  ] President [PER Deby  ] to " conclude the peace agreement with [LOC Sudan  ] . 
" End Key Points. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Ali  ] 's assertion that [LOC Egypt  ] is only concerned with [ORG Nile  ] waters probably results from recent , intensive GoE efforts to solidify the two countries' position on the [ORG Nile Basin Initiative  ] ( [ORG NBI  ] ) and counter efforts by the other seven [ORG NBI  ] countries to impose an agreement that [LOC Egypt  ] opposes ( reftels [MISC A-B  ] ) . 
The GoE is not only concerned about access to [ORG Nile  ] waters , but is also concerned that instability in [LOC Sudan  ] could result in large flows of refugees into [LOC Egypt  ] as occurred during the [MISC North-South  ] civil war . 
End Comment. --------------------------------------------- ----------------- [ORG NCP  ] Preparing Working with [LOC Egypt  ] to Hold Presidential Election --------------------------------------------- ----------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Kamal Ali  ] , Head of the [MISC Sudanese  ] [ORG National Congress Party  ] 's ( [ORG NCP  ] ) office in [LOC Cairo  ] told us on February 2 that the [ORG NCP  ] had helped its supporters to register to vote in [LOC Cairo  ] in the upcoming April Presidential elections . 
He said the [ORG NCP  ] was educating local [MISC Sudanese  ] on the voting process because most [MISC Sudanese  ] in [LOC Cairo  ] will be participating in their first election . 
According to [PER Ali  ] , the [ORG GoS  ] is working with the GoE to organize and provide security for voting centers in [LOC Cairo  ] , [LOC Alexandria  ] and [LOC Aswan  ] . 
He said [LOC Khartoum  ] had asked [LOC Egypt  ] and the [ORG Arab League  ] to help monitor elections in [LOC Sudan.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Despite this cooperation , [PER Ali  ] said [LOC Egypt  ] would have a limited role to play in [LOC Sudan  ] because " its actions are circumspect due to [LOC Cairo  ] 's singular focus on [ORG Nile  ] waters . 
" He said [LOC Chad  ] and [LOC Libya  ] are the two neighboring countries best place to help to resolve the situation in [LOC Darfur  ] . 
[LOC CAIRO  ] 00000165 002 OF 003 --------------------------------------------- ---- [ORG USG Role Important  ] , [MISC Policies Should Be Fact-Based  ] --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Ali  ] said the [ORG NCP  ] was skeptical that the [ORG USG  ] would honor the elections if the [ORG NCP  ] were to win . 
He stated that many in the [ORG NCP  ] " expect the [LOC U.S.  ] to react like it did when [ORG HAMAS  ] won elections in [LOC Palestine  ] in 2006 . 
" Nevertheless , [PER Ali  ] praised the role of [LOC S/E Gration  ] in working with the [MISC NCP-led  ] government to resolve the problems in [LOC Sudan  ] . 
He said the [LOC U.S.  ] can play a positive and significant role , but expressed frustration that the [ORG USG  ] 's policy of pressuring [LOC Khartoum  ] was unwarranted given the [MISC USG-GoS  ] cooperation on counterterrorism , [LOC Darfur  ] , CPA implementation and democratic transformation . 
He bemoaned that despite these " positive actions , " [LOC Sudan  ] is still on the [ORG USG  ] 's list of states that support terrorism and subject to economic sanctions. ------------------------------------------ Two Trains of Thought on Future Engagement ------------------------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Ali  ] said there were two trains of thought within the [MISC Sudanese  ] Government on future cooperation with the [ORG USG  ] . 
The pro-engagement group , led by [PER Ghazi Salahuddin  ] , believed that the [LOC U.S.  ] was an essential partner and bilateral engagement should continue despite " the lack of [ORG USG  ] rewards " to this point . 
[PER Ali  ] stated that the pro-engagement group was still preeminent , but was losing ground to the anti-engagement group , which believed that the lack of tangible benefits was a signal that the [LOC U.S.  ] was not interested in a bilateral relationship and the group advocated that [LOC Sudan  ] should halt all concessions. ---------------------------------------- [ORG Southern Secession Will Lead to Conflict  ] ---------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Ali  ] stated that many in the [ORG GoS  ] are resigned to the inevitable secession of the [LOC South  ] and believe it may be for the best . 
However , he believes that despite the best intentions of [LOC Khartoum  ] and [LOC Juba  ] , the secession of [LOC South Sudan  ] will lead to war because it is in the " nature of the region . 
" He said historical disputes , migratory patterns of indigenous tribes , uncertainty over border demarcation , and the lack of consensus on [MISC Abyei  ] , the [ORG Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile  ] state are " time bombs for renewed conflict . 
" <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Ali  ] believes that it is best to promote unity by offering [LOC South Sudan  ] financial incentives . 
He told us that some leaders in the [ORG NCP  ] believe it would be best to " give [LOC South Sudan  ] 100% of the revenue from the southern oil fields in exchange for preserving the unity of the country . 
" According to [PER Ali  ] , this would avoid a conflict that would stop oil revenues altogether and address concerns that a new [LOC South Sudan  ] would foment instability in the region. ----------------------- [MISC Doha  ] Talks " Just Words " ----------------------- [LOC CAIRO  ] 00000165 003 OF 003 <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Ali  ] said the [ORG GoS  ] has shown its willingness to engage in talks with the [MISC Darfuri  ] rebels to resolve the crisis in the [LOC Darfur  ] region . 
However , he said up to this point the [LOC Doha  ] talks " resulted in just words and no action . 
" According to [PER Ali  ] , the blame for the lack of a resolution in [LOC Darfur  ] lies with the [MISC Darfuri  ] rebel groups , which are not united , and key leaders , such as [PER Abdel Wahid Al Nur  ] , who are not willing to participate in talks with the government , without securing " large , personal benefits . 
" He stated that [LOC Khartoum  ] has taken tangible steps to increase security in [LOC Darfur  ] and improve the humanitarian situation . 
According to [PER Ali  ] , the return of some IDPs to their villages is proof that the [ORG GoS  ] has acted in good faith to improve conditions in [LOC Darfur.  ] ------------------------------------------- Pressure on [LOC France  ] Needed to Resolve [LOC Darfur  ] ------------------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Ali  ] said the recent agreement between [LOC Chad  ] and [LOC Sudan  ] was a positive step to resolve the [LOC Darfur  ] crisis . 
He told us that the [ORG GoS  ] is working to remove [MISC Chadian  ] opposition groups from the border area . 
He said [LOC Chad  ] needs to reciprocate by taking steps to do the same with JEM to " conclude " the agreement. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Ali  ] believes [LOC France  ] holds the trump cards to resolving the [LOC Darfur  ] conflict . 
He said [LOC Washington  ] needs to pressure [LOC Paris  ] to bring [PER Abdel Wahid Al Nur  ] to the negotiation table and get the [MISC French  ] Government to push [MISC Chadian  ] President [PER Deby  ] to " conclude the peace agreement with [LOC Sudan  ] .
