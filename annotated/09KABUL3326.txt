( C ) [PER Fitrat  ] noted approximately $600 million in capital left the country prior to the August election .

On a brighter note , inflation stood at a record low of negative 12 percent ( with core inflation at 3.2 percent ) . 
Food and fuel stockpiles and donations , combined with a record agricultural crop , have pushed down prices , [PER Fitrat  ] said. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 .

[PER Fitrat  ] added that President [PER Karzai  ] told him to fire the head of [ORG Pashtany Bank  ] for corruption and while he cannot do so , [PER Fitrat  ] has asked the [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] to remove the bank 's entire supervisory board , credit officer , and loan officer and also to install and utilize core banking software .
