End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The Deputy Secretary , accompanied by Ambassador , SCA Assistant Secretary [PER Richard Boucher  ] , and [ORG S/CT Coordinator Dell Dailey  ] met President [PER Musharraf  ] on September 13 . 
[PER Musharraf  ] congratulated [PER Negroponte  ] on leading a successful second session of the [ORG U.S.-Pakistan Strategic Dialogue  ] ( septel ) . 
[PER Musharraf  ] outlined his priorities as: ( 1 ) on the political front , to smooth the run up to his re-election as president and then complete parliamentary elections ; and ( 2 ) after the elections , to focus on political reconciliation , good governance , sustaining economic growth and fighting terrorism . 
Re-Election Scenario -------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Musharraf  ] said that he expected [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] in attempting to disqualify [PER Musharraf  ] as a candidate . 
He said that he could be re-elected in uniform and before the current assemblies “legally and constitutionally.” The only question is whether he will take off his uniform before or after he takes office again . 
But it would depend on [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ; [PER Musharraf  ] was hoping that he could engage with him in a positive way in terms of the pending cases . 
[PER Musharraf  ] said the process of the presidential election would require 18 days ; to finish by the October 15 deadline , the process must begin at the latest on September 27 . 
[PER Musharraf  ] reiterated that he has the majority of votes required in the current [ORG National  ] and Provincial Assemblies , but it cast a “moral” doubt on the election if the opposition resigned en masse. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) On the deportation of former Prime Minister [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] , the Deputy Secretary noted that the administration understood what had happened , but not everyone in the [LOC U.S.  ] appreciated the nuances of [MISC Pakistani  ] politics . 
It was important for [PER Musharraf  ] to be as inclusive as possible and ensure elections were free and fair. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Musharraf  ] said that after the elections , it would be important to include [PER Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam  ] ( [ORG JUI-F  ] ) leader [PER Fazlur Rehman  ] in the governing coalition . 
[PER Musharraf  ] described him as moderate and pliable . 
It would be important , especially if the agreement with [PER Bhutto  ] succeeds , to avoid the optics of religious vs. non-religious political groupings , and [PER Rehman  ] can be helpful in splitting the religious parties . 
[LOC Afghanistan/India  ] ----------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Negroponte  ] noted the successful trilateral meeting he hosted on September 11 for [LOC Pakistan  ] and [MISC Afghan  ] Presidential Advisors [PER Tariq Aziz  ] and [PER Rassoul  ] . 
He said he was encouraged by what he saw as the shifting attitude and lower rhetoric of President [PER Karzai  ] towards [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
He urged that both sides name and organize meetings of the sub-jirga groups that had been agreed at the Peace Jirga. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Musharraf  ] said he agreed and will go ahead with selecting Pakistan’s group of 25 for the sub-jirga ; these should be the “right” people with good influence . 
But he suggested it would be even better to have a jirga with five to six participants on both sides to lead their fellow tribesmen ; [LOC Pakistan  ] had raised this idea with [LOC Kabul  ] . 
The most important outcome of the Peace Jirga , according to [LOC ISLAMABAD  ] 00004085 002 OF 003 [PER Musharraf  ] , was the [MISC Afghan  ] recognition that they needed to talk to the “opposition , ” and this would be more successful with a smaller sub-jirga group. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Musharraf  ] asked the [LOC U.S.  ] to intervene on one issue of real concern--the “deliberate” attempt of [LOC Kabul  ] and [LOC New Delhi  ] to destabilize [ORG Balochistan  ] . 
He insisted that [LOC Pakistan  ] had ample proof that [LOC India  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] were involved in efforts to provide weapons , training and funding for [PER Baloch  ] extremists through [PER Brahamdagh Bugti  ] and [PER Baloch Marri  ] , two [MISC Baloch  ] nationalists , who were living in [LOC Kabul.  ] “We have letters instructing who to give what weapons to whom.” [PER Musharraf  ] said he had raised this with [PER Karzai  ] , who replied “give me time and I will address it.” [PER Musharraf  ] said he was still waiting . 
Assistant Secretary [PER Boucher  ] noted that he had recently raised the issue with [PER Rassoul  ] . 
[PER Musharraf  ] added “If [LOC India  ] wants to continue , let’s see what our options will be.” [PER Negroponte  ] asked if , after the elections , there was a possibility to move forward on negotiations with [LOC India  ] . 
[PER Musharraf  ] said yes , especially on [LOC Kashmir  ] , where the population was getting restless . 
FATA: [ORG Al Qaeda  ] , [ORG Taliban  ] , [MISC Extremism Are Different Problems  ] --------------------------------------------- ------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Negroponte  ] noted that he had just received Embassy [MISC Islamabad’s  ] briefing on our plans to support the [MISC GOP  ] integrated security and development plan for the [LOC Federally Administered Tribal Areas  ] ( [ORG FATA  ] ) . 
[PER Musharraf  ] said the [MISC GOP  ] strategy was good , but its application would take time and patience . 
Noting statements by the media and some administration officials , [PER Musharraf  ] said that [LOC Pakistan  ] did not need to be told by the [LOC U.S.  ] to take more action against terrorism because “we know it is in our own interests.” He said he gives this message every day , everywhere to thousands in [LOC Pakistan  ] , and they are starting to listen. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Musharraf  ] outlined the differing threats of al [ORG Qaeda  ] , the [ORG Taliban  ] and extremism . 
These , he asserted , were three distinct issues that too often are confused by the media or “lower-level” [LOC U.S.  ] officials who do not understand the complexities of the challenge [LOC Pakistan  ] is facing . 
[ORG Al Qaeda  ] is in the mountains , especially in [LOC North  ] and [LOC South Waziristan  ] and [LOC Bajaur  ] , and the [MISC GOP  ] is “trying to deal with the locals to get them out.” The [MISC GOP  ] is telling the locals to avoid the trouble that comes with associating with foreigners , and there has been some success especially in expelling the [MISC Uzbeks  ] . 
Now , [PER Musharraf  ] wants the tribes to expel the [MISC Arabs  ] . 
The strategy is to do selected attacks and follow up with political efforts ; here , too , [PER Fazlur Rehman  ] can help . 
But the mountains absorb lots of troops , so in the short-term , [PER Musharraf  ] has put a brigade in [LOC North Waziristan  ] and two more in the settled areas on the [ORG FATA  ] border . 
At some later point , the [MISC GOP  ] will move troops into [LOC South Waziristan  ] ; the goal there was to break [PER Baitullah Mehsud  ] and his organization. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Turning to the [ORG Taliban  ] , [PER Musharraf  ] said this was a different issue . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] could fight al [ORG Qaeda  ] with troops , but the [ORG Taliban  ] were being supported by locals opposed to the foreign presence in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Military action against these locals , explained [PER Musharraf  ] , would require “fighting against our own people , ” and this was very sensitive . 
So , the [MISC GOP  ] was reinforcing the borders and telling the locals they had no right to cross the border . 
This problem required a combined military , political and administrative solution . 
On the politics , again , [PER Fazlur Rehman  ] could help . 
[PER Musharraf  ] speculated , however , that if [LOC Washington  ] heard he was meeting with [PER Rehman  ] , he would be accused of aiding and abetting religious extremists . 
On the administrative/development side , [PER Musharraf  ] said he was reinvigorating the political agent system , building boarding schools that could remove students from extremist influence , and creating jobs in the marble and olive oil industries . 
Foreign Secretary [PER Khan  ] reiterated Pakistan’s concern about including [ORG Article  ] 347 and 348 on textiles ( cotton trousers ) in pending [ORG Reconstruction Opportunity Zone  ] ( [ORG ROZ  ] ) legislation . 
[PER Musharraf  ] noted that [LOC Pakistan  ] was also expanding and better equipping the [ORG Frontier Corps  ] , [ORG Levies  ] and [ORG Khassadar  ] forces. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Musharraf  ] described extremism in [MISC Pakistani  ] society as yet another facet of the challenge , and this required [LOC ISLAMABAD  ] 00004085 003 OF 003 changing mindsets . 
He had attacked the problem in several ways . 
The [MISC GOP  ] had increased control over mosques , banning loudspeakers , collection plates , posters and distribution of pro-jihad literature . 
The police now understood the importance of this activity ; there had been a 90 percent success in shutting down these activities . 
[PER Musharraf  ] said he had banned 23 organizations ( some before 9/11 ) , but they keep changing their names so this was a constant challenge . 
He has had some success on madrassa reform by introducing new curricula and registering 75 percent of madrassas with the government . 
The [MISC GOP  ] has introduced new secular subjects ; 70 percent of the registered madrassas have accepted the new program ; and some have begun teaching these new secular subjects. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Musharraf  ] thanked the [LOC U.S.  ] for approving the five-year $750 million plan for [ORG FATA  ] projects but said that the projects and [MISC ROZs  ] had not yet materialized . 
[PER Negroponte  ] noted that we were making progress on the [ORG ROZ  ] legislation and had actually proposed more than $750 million over five years in assistance . 
The funding process moves slowly , but the [MISC Pakistanis  ] would be seeing results soon . 
[PER Musharraf  ] replied that the perceptions were different in [LOC Pakistan  ] , and said that [LOC U.S.  ] statements and the 9/11 Commission legislation showed that the [LOC U.S.  ] had doubts about Pakistan’s intentions . 
Why , [PER Musharraf  ] wondered again , did the media and the [LOC U.S.  ] believe he was playing a “double game” and not doing enough ? 
[PER F-16s: Don’t  ] Violate Our Deal ----------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) In closing , [PER Musharraf  ] said that the [LOC Pakistan  ] Air Force was upset over what they felt was the [LOC U.S.  ] undermining “by design” the agreement to sell [LOC Pakistan  ] F-16s . 
[PER Musharraf  ] said , “don’t violate this deal as it would unnecessarily upset bilateral relations.” <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( U ) The Deputy Secretary’s staff has cleared this message .
