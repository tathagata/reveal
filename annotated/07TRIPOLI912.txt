Summary: [MISC Italian  ] energy firm [ORG Eni  ] has struck a major deal with [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG National Oil Corporation  ] that will significantly extend its concession contracts and launch an ambitious series of exploration and development activities . 
While trumpeted by [ORG Eni  ] as a success , the deal carries serious negatives for the company , and may pave the way for the imposition of similar , not altogether positive arrangements with other foreign oil and gas concession holders . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
Leading [MISC Italian  ] energy firm [ORG Eni  ] announced a 25-year extension to its oil and gas contracts with [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG National Oil Corporation  ] ( [ORG NOC  ] ) October 16 . 
Press reports indicate that some of [ORG Eni  ] 's most important oil and gas concessions were to expire over the next two years ; the new agreement extends all of its concessions until 2042 and 2047 , respectively . 
[ORG Eni  ] will invest $14 billion in related infrastructure ( a total matched by the [ORG NOC  ] for a total of $28 billion ) . 
[ORG Eni  ] will also expend at least $800 million for additional exploration activities , a sum approaching the mammoth $900 million exploration plan unveiled following [ORG British Petroleum  ] 's May 2007 deal with the [ORG NOC  ] . 
[ORG Eni  ] and [ORG NOC  ] will also reportedly embark on a limited program of enhanced oil recovery ( [ORG EOR  ] ) in some of [ORG Eni  ] 's existing fields. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
The new deal paves the way for a potential doubling of [LOC Libya  ] 's gas exporting capacity to 16 billion cubic meters ( [ORG BCM  ] ) . 
[ORG Eni  ] is [LOC Libya  ] 's partner for the " [MISC Greenstream  ] " gas pipeline , which runs from the [MISC Libyan  ] coast to [LOC Sicily  ] and which handles its extant gas export capacity . 
The new contract envisages expanding [MISC Greenstream  ] 's capacity to 11 billion [ORG BCM  ] and constructing a new liquefied-natural-gas ( [ORG LNG  ] ) plant at the [LOC Mellita  ] gas export hub with a capacity of [ORG BCM  ] a year . 
STEEP HIDDEN COSTS <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
While cast in most press accounts as a triumph for the [MISC Italian  ] firm , the deal also carries substantial costs . 
[ORG Eni  ] officials are reportedly far from enthralled with the new arrangements . 
The terms of the new agreement take [ORG Eni  ] out of a true concession agreement , under which they derived a relatively healthy margin on the product that they lifted ( exported ) from [LOC Libya  ] , and into a production sharing agreement . 
Under its previous terms , [ORG Eni  ] was responsible for tax and royalties on lifted product , but was compensated by the [ORG NOC  ] for substantial portions of its exploration and development costs , including well-drilling . 
Under the new arrangements , which are governed by the general terms of the current round of Exploration and Production Sharing ( [LOC EPSA IV  ] ) agreements , [ORG Eni  ] is responsible for all of these costs . 
[ORG Eni  ] thus has a lower cost recovery factor in line with recent concession " winners " ( who have won with bids as low as 7% ) . 
The result is that the [ORG NOC  ] takes a larger cut of produced oil and [ORG Eni  ] books a lower quantity of reserves , negatively affecting the company 's share price . 
On top of this , [ORG Eni  ] will reportedly pay a $1 billion bonus to [ORG NOC  ] as part of the deal , and has agreed to retire an outstanding $500 million debt to the [ORG NOC  ] by year 's end . 
A WORRYING SIGN OF THINGS TO COME ? <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
Representatives of international oil companies ( [ORG IOCs  ] ) operating in [LOC Libya  ] have expressed grave doubts about the [ORG Eni  ] deal . 
One executive described it as " scary , " adding that it raised serious questions about [ORG NOC  ] adherence to the sanctity of existing contracts . 
Post has learned that the [ORG NOC  ] has approached several [ORG IOCs  ] , including [ORG TOTAL  ] ( [LOC France  ] ) , [ORG Wintershall  ] ( [MISC German  ] ) and [ORG Repsol  ] ( [LOC Spain  ] ) , to explore renegotiating the terms of their current operations . 
There is widespread worry among the [ORG IOCs  ] that the [ORG NOC  ] may expand this effort and open discussions with other concession holders in an effort to extract more favorable terms . 
The use of the [LOC EPSA IV  ] bidding round model of production sharing agreements would most damage companies operating under concession agreements , such as [ORG Wintershall  ] . 
Those agreements were concluded during the sanctions period , when low spot market prices and [LOC Libya  ] 's limited options resulted in the granting of more favorable terms . 
The [ORG IOCs  ] that have been approached about renegotiating are irked that the [ORG NOC  ] is coming after them now , particularly since their companies took substantial risks to do business in [LOC Libya  ] when [ORG UN  ] sanctions were in place. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
Comment: Post 's contacts have expressed acute annoyance with [ORG Eni  ] for conceding to the [ORG NOC  ] 's initiative , particularly given the company 's past record of similar behavior . 
Contacts point to [ORG Eni  ] 's agreement on a $150 million " social development TRIPOLI 00000912 002 OF 002 package " with the [ORG NOC  ] in September 2006 as another example of the firm 's having given in to pressure from the [ORG NOC  ] . 
With [ORG Eni  ] 's new deal on the books , the [ORG NOC  ] will now have greater leverage to force other companies to conclude similar agreements . 
At the same time , the quality of parcels offered under the auspices of [LOC Libya  ] 's latest [MISC EPSA  ] rounds has been increasingly marginal in economic terms . 
The confluence of increasingly difficult hydrocarbon reservoirs and an increasingly avaricious [ORG NOC  ] could curb further interest by major [ORG IOCs  ] in new [MISC EPSA  ] agreements , leading to greater participation by smaller , less capable operators in [LOC Libya  ] 's oil and gas sector .
