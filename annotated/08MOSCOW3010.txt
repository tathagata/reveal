( C ) [LOC Iceland  ] 's [ORG Moscow Deputy  ] Chief of Mission , [PER Magnus Hannesson  ] , told us that the proposed loan from [LOC Russia  ] is a strictly financial transaction . 
He insisted [LOC Iceland  ] 's economic fundamentals are sound but said the country needs assistance providing liquidity to its banking sector . 
[LOC Iceland  ] 's monetary authorities had begun soliciting support from friends and allies last spring , but to no avail . 
[PER Hannesson  ] explained that his government had felt it had no choice but to consider less conventional sources of financing , and that [LOC Russia  ] was one of those sources . 
Loan discussions with [LOC Russia  ] 's [ORG Finance Ministry  ] and [ORG Central Bank  ] ( [ORG CBR  ] ) began in the summer. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Hannesson  ] confirmed that a team of officials from [LOC Reykjavik  ] would arrive the week of October 13 to negotiate the loan . 
Echoing [ORG Icelandic Central Bank  ] statements to Embassy [LOC Reykjavik  ] ( reftel ) , he expressed confidence that the 4 billion [MISC Euro loan  ] agreement would be concluded very soon . 
[PER Hannesson  ] said he would participate in the meetings between the [ORG GOI  ] delegation and the [ORG GOR  ] next week and would provide us with a readout. ------------------------------------- No Effect on [LOC Iceland  ] 's Foreign Policy ------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Hanneson  ] emphasized that [LOC Iceland  ] 's foreign policy would not change as a result of a loan agreement with [LOC Russia  ] . 
He reiterated the loan was strictly financial and not a quid pro quo . 
[LOC Iceland  ] was in need of funds ; [MISC Russian  ] officials had determined that [LOC Iceland  ] was an acceptable risk . 
The [ORG GOI  ] would be grateful to [LOC Russia  ] but would not provide access to military installations or change its stance on any issue in exchange for the loan. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [MISC Russian  ] loan to [LOC Iceland  ] strikes us yet another in a proliferating series of [ORG GOR  ] " vanity " projects that [LOC Russia  ] may no longer be able to afford . 
The financial crisis has hit [LOC Russia  ] hard and the [MISC Russian  ] economy is starting to feel the effects . 
The loan to [LOC Iceland  ] suggests that the [ORG GOR  ] has still not come to terms with this , nor with the country 's rapid fall from economic grace . 
End Comment .
