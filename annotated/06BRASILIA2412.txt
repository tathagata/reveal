It was their second substantive meeting in the space of a week , and the hour-long discussion focused primarily on a agenda topics and modalities for a possible visit by [PER Lula  ] to the [LOC United States  ] for a meeting with President [PER Bush  ] ( at his invitation ) , bilateral relations and [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
[PER Carvalho  ] also indicated plans are not yet finalized for [PER Lula  ] 's re-inauguration on 1 January 2007 , but that thought is being given to a small-scale event , with foreign governments represented by ambassadors , not international delegates . 
End summary . 
Presidential Meeting <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Carvalho  ] said [PER Lula  ] is eager for the meeting with President [PER Bush  ] , and would welcome an informal , non-Washington venue befitting the warm relationship between the presidents . 
[PER Carvalho  ] and Ambassador then discussed possible agenda items for a [MISC Lula-Bush  ] meeting . 
Focus points could be: ( 1 ) bio-fuels ; ( 2 ) debt relief in developing countries ( IDB President [PER Moreno  ] mentioned this to Ambassador recently and it is an area of interest for [PER Lula  ] ; ( 2 ) Brazil-US security/intelligence exchange ; ( 3 ) [LOC Cuba  ] - U.S.-Brazil cooperation to facilitate a post-Fidel " soft landing ; " ( 4 ) trade - moving toward a practical/effective dialogue in [PER Lula  ] 's second term ; ( 4 ) climate . 
Ambassador and [PER Carvalho  ] agreed that these would be preliminary ideas , and that the agenda could be adjusted and developed . 
[PER Carvalho  ] seemed enthused about the agenda items and indicated he would share them with [PER Lula  ] at once , giving us feedback asap . 
Bilateral Relations <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Carvalho  ] again made it clear he wants to serve as a direct channel for the Ambassador to [PER Lula  ] , and indicated he would facilitate face-to-face meetings when there is a need . 
[PER Carvalho  ] did ask the Ambassador to assure he also remains attentive to his formal relationship with the foreign ministry ( [ORG MRE  ] ) , " which can be jealous of its equities . 
" Ambassador assured [PER Carvalho  ] of his sensitivity on this point , and explained he would be flying to [LOC Rio  ] later in the week especially to meet with Foreign Minister [PER Amorim  ] for further discussion of the presidents' meeting plans ( septel to follow ) . 
[PER Carvalho  ] also underscored again that the second [PER Lula  ] mandate will see a closer approximation to the [LOC U.S.  ] , including on the trade front . 
[PER Carvalho  ] -- who has been [PER Lula  ] 's confidante and advisor for more than 30 years -- explained that [PER Lula  ] 's first term had been a balancing act between maintaining credibility with the conservative market and keeping the far left of [PER Lula  ] 's base content by assuring them [PER Lula  ] , as president , was not surrendering their traditional banners . 
In the second term , [PER Lula  ] is better positioned to take issues on pragmatically , including trade , [PER Carvalho  ] said . 
Ambassador noted [PER Lula  ] may be practical but there remain people in the [ORG GOB  ] who seem ideologically driven , and who make statements that can confuse [LOC Washington  ] about [LOC Brazil  ] 's policy direction . 
Ambassador did not name names , but his comments clearly were directed at [ORG MRE  ] Secretary General [PER Pinheiro Guimaraes  ] , a famous anti-U.S. ideologue , who at a conference a few days ago said publicly it is not impossible that [LOC Brazil  ] might someday leave the [MISC Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty  ] . 
[PER Carvalho  ] was openly dismissive of Guimaraes' remarks and reiterated that the [ORG GOB  ] is focused on working with us . 
[LOC Venezuela  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Ambassador noted [PER Lula  ] 's travel to [LOC Venezuela  ] on 14 November , and reviewed [PER Chavez  ] 's irresponsible rhetoric , his arms acquisitions , and other provocations . 
Ambassador [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00002412 002 OF 002 stressed that the [ORG USG  ] sees [LOC Brazil  ] as a crucial counterbalance in the region to [PER Chavez  ] 's unpredictable and troubling behavior . 
[PER Carvalho  ] said the [ORG GOB  ] also has " difficult " relations with [PER Chavez  ] and [LOC Bolivia  ] 's [PER Evo Morales  ] , but has attempted to maintain a balanced approach in which [LOC Brazil  ] can ameliorate their behaviors through dialogue . 
Ambassador reiterated that the [ORG USG  ] hopes more engagement by [LOC Brazil  ] will serve to counterbalance [ORG Chavez'  ] pernicious influence . 
Inauguration <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Carvalho  ] confided that planning for [PER Lula  ] 's January inaugural remains fluid , but that it appears [PER Lula  ] will have to take office on 1 January , because of constitutional issues . 
Hence the [ORG GOB  ] is considering a low-key event , with foreign governments represented by their ambassadors instead of international delegations . 
He undertook to keep Ambassador posted on the developing planning .
