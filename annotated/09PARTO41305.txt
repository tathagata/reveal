Reason 1.4 ( b , d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) March 31 , 2009 ; 9:00 a.m. ; The [LOC Hague  ] , [LOC Netherlands.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Participants: [LOC U.S.  ] The Secretary Deputy Secretary [PER Lew SRAP Holbrooke A/S Fried Ms. Abedin  ] , Deputy Chief of Staff to the Secretary [PER Mr. Sullivan  ] , Deputy Chief of Staff to the Secretary [PER Mr. Falls  ] ( Embassy Notetaker ) [LOC NETHERLANDS  ] FM [LOC Verhagen Pieter de Gooijer  ] , [ORG DG for Political Affairs  ] Robert [PER de Groot  ] , Deputy [ORG DG for Political Affairs  ] [PER Peter Potman  ] , Deputy for [ORG Western Hemisphere Affairs  ] [PER Bart Rijs  ] , [PER Spokesperson Marcel de Vink  ] , Private Secretary ( Chief of Staff ) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) SUMMARY . 
In a cordial meeting , the Secretary and [MISC Dutch  ] FM [PER Verhagen  ] reviewed [LOC Afghanistan  ] policing and regional politics , [ORG NATO  ] and [LOC Russia  ] , [ORG Guantanamo  ] and human rights , and the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
Both agreed to help celebrate the [LOC NY  ] 400 commemorating [PER Henry Hudson  ] 's trip to the [MISC New World  ] and founding of the first [MISC Dutch  ] colony . 
END SUMMARY. ----------- [LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] ----------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The two leaders met on the margins of the March 31 [ORG International Conference  ] on [LOC Afghanistan  ] , held in The [LOC Hague  ] . 
The Secretary and [PER Verhagen  ] exchanged compliments on the [MISC Dutch-hosted  ] conference and the new [LOC U.S.  ] strategy toward [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The Secretary noted that our common goal is to build security for the [MISC Afghans  ] . 
While prospects for the [MISC Afghan  ] Army are good , the situation with the police is more challenging . 
The Secretary encouraged [PER Verhagen  ] to approach his [MISC European  ] colleagues to win support for funding the [MISC Afghan  ] police . 
[LOC Japan  ] 's offer to pay six months' of police salaries was generous , but the needs are significant . 
It is difficult to properly screen the applicants for security concerns , to provide an adequate salary , and to build the same morale level as within the [MISC Afghan  ] army . 
[LOC Europe  ] should be able to resolve any policy concerns over civil vs. military policing . 
The [LOC United States  ] is willing to consider putting the police under the [MISC Afghan  ] Army , which functions well , if necessary . 
[PER SRAP Holbrooke  ] added that [LOC Italy  ] seems to be the stumbling block on the police force. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Verhagen  ] responded that policing is a concern , and indeed worrisome . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] intend to double their personnel contribution for police training and provide $40 million for salaries . 
Regarding [LOC Europe  ] 's contributions , some nations such as [LOC France  ] find it difficult to use military and civilian police together . 
That is not a problem for the [LOC Netherlands  ] , but it is difficult for the [MISC Dutch  ] MOD to use Gendarmes as trainers . 
EUPOL will likely announce soon that it is ready with 400 police trainers. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The Secretary emphasized regional coordination - - we don't want to impose our view -- as an essential element to the new [LOC U.S.  ] strategy . 
The biggest challenge is working with [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[LOC China  ] , [LOC India  ] , and [LOC Russia  ] are engaged . 
[LOC Iran  ] has signaled it may be willing to help on border issues due to concerns about narcotics trafficking. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The Secretary thanked [PER Verhagen  ] again for the conference , noting , You are the best of Allies .. . 
Uruzgan is a model . 
She added that she understood [MISC Dutch  ] domestic political concerns , and that she hoped the [MISC Dutch  ] public would continue to support a strong deployment in [LOC Afghanistan.  ] --------------- [ORG NATO  ] AND [LOC RUSSIA  ] --------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The Secretary noted that [LOC France  ] 's participation in [ORG NATO  ] had been resolved through close consultations with [LOC Turkey  ] , and that [MISC Danish  ] PM [PER Rasmussen  ] might do himself a favor and address [MISC Turkish  ] concerns about his candidacy for [ORG NATO  ] Secretary General in a similar manner . 
[PER SRAP Holbrooke  ] wondered whether [ORG NATO  ] SYG [ORG De Hoop Scheffer  ] might be able to extend his tenure . 
The Secretary noted that this was one possibility , if the [MISC Turkish  ] concerns persist. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Verhagen  ] was confident [ORG De Hoop Scheffer  ] would stay on as needed . 
Given the public statement by PM Erdogan against [PER Rasmussen  ] , however , it may be difficult to resolve [MISC Turkish  ] concerns. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The Secretary noted the President will encourage the [MISC Russians  ] to pull back from [LOC Georgia  ] . 
[ORG Eastern European  ] nations want to focus on [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC Russia  ] 's efforts to pressure them , and they are looking for reassurance from us ? understandably , based on their history and recent events in [LOC Georgia  ] . 
We should not let [LOC Russia  ] intimidate [ORG Eastern Europe  ] , and we should support their aspirations . 
For example , [LOC Ukraine  ] is looking to develop its energy capacity . 
At the same time , the [LOC United States  ] wants to stand up the [ORG NATO-Russia Council  ] . 
Obviously , we should work with them on non- proliferation issues . 
[ORG NATO  ] also needs to look to other issues , such as cyber security. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Verhagen  ] agreed and stated that as [ORG NATO  ] reviews its strategic concept , it needs to go beyond [ORG Article  ] 5 and look at regional and global threats . 
[ORG NATO  ] should not focus solely on [LOC Russia  ] but also on these broader issues . 
For the [MISC Dutch  ] , [LOC Russia  ] is not the threat it was . 
[ORG NATO  ] should look to cyber security , energy security , and piracy , for example . 
[PER Verhagen  ] cautioned that the installation of missiles in [LOC Poland  ] could be misinterpreted as evidence of a lack of faith by [LOC Poland  ] in [ORG Article  ] 5 , in favor of a bilateral security relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] The Secretary responded that President [PER Yeltsin  ] once had told President [PER Clinton  ] that he agreed the [LOC United States  ] wasn't a threat , but little old ladies in [LOC St. Petersburg  ] don't agree . 
In other words , mistrust was a political problem above all. --------------------------- [ORG GUANTANAMO  ] AND HUMAN RIGHTS --------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The Secretary thanked FM [PER Verhagen  ] for the [MISC Dutch  ] effort to frame a response to the legal issues surrounding [LOC Guantanamo  ] and asked for FM [PER Verhagen  ] 's further advice . 
She also thanked [PER Verhagen  ] for the [MISC Dutch  ] effort to draft new text for the [LOC Durban  ] review conference. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( S ) [PER Verhagen  ] responded that , while the [LOC Netherlands  ] would be very hesitant to take people [ detainees ] , ... we want to assist . 
He noted that , due to the [LOC Schengen  ] visa regime , [ORG EU  ] members will have to consider jointly the implications of accepting detainees . 
Asked by [PER A/S Fried  ] whether the [ORG EU  ] may set the bar too high for a general [LOC EU-U.S.  ] understanding , [PER Verhagen  ] said no . 
I 'm difficult , but not frustrating your process. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) On a second track with [LOC Guantanamo  ] , [PER Verhagen  ] said the [LOC Netherlands  ] is supporting university discussions on the legal issues and has started a discussion on having the [ORG ICC  ] respond to terrorist crimes . 
In addition , the [LOC Netherlands  ] is willing to assist with detainee rehabilitation programs in [LOC Yemen.  ] ----------- MIDDLE EAST ----------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) The Secretary urged [PER Verhagen  ] to stick with the [ORG Quartet Principles  ] for [ORG Hamas  ] . 
She understood there was pressure to change policy , but now is not the time to open the door...now is the time to keep the pressure on . 
On [LOC Syria  ] , she noted that it is worthwhile to have a more inclusive approach . 
On [LOC Israel  ] , the [LOC United States  ] will press to end settlements. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [PER Verhagen  ] said he fully agreed that the [ORG Quartet Principles  ] should apply to the new [LOC Palestine  ] government . 
However , I am more and more isolated within the [ORG EU...I  ] was the only one to raise the issue at a recent meeting . 
The mainstream says we provoked [ORG Hamas  ] . 
[PER Verhagen  ] said we need to apply the same human rights principles to both [LOC Israel  ] and [LOC Palestine  ] . 
[LOC Israel  ] is getting blamed for violations , but not [MISC Palestinians  ] . 
DG [PER De Gooijer  ] noted that the situation within the [ORG EU  ] was upside down -- it appears the [ORG EU  ] might ask the new [MISC Israeli  ] government to adhere to the Quartet principles .
