He credited the [ORG USG  ] for Pakistan’s relative free and fair elections on February 18 . 
Pakistan’s women had taken on increased leadership roles throughout the new federal and provincial governments , he claimed . 
[PER Gilani  ] recounted his two meetings with President [PER Bush  ] this past summer and noted that he has also met with candidate ( now President-Elect ) [PER Barack Obama  ] . 
He extended congratulations on the recent [LOC U.S.  ] elections . 
[PER Gilani  ] looked forward to a closer relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] , ranging from intelligence sharing to educational exchanges. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Gilani  ] pressed the [ORG USG  ] to share all credible , actionable threat information ; “we will hit the targets ourselves , ” he promised . 
[PER Gilani  ] added that drone strikes not only violated [MISC Pakistani  ] sovereignty , but also fed anti-U.S. sentiment , making harder his own public case that the struggle against extremists was “Pakistan’s war.” Instead , there was popular pressure on elected officials like himself to forcefully respond to alleged [LOC U.S.  ] border incursions , which were “an embarrassment” for the [MISC GOP  ] . 
The “trust gap” should be filled with joint actions , he argued , and , while he might be criticized for such bilateral cooperation , he believed he could effectively convince the public that those targeted were responsible for [PER Benazir Bhutto’s  ] assassination and the killing of innocents at schools , shopping centers and police stations. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Gilani  ] stated , “we have the will but not the capacity.” He claimed the [MISC GOP  ] was seeing success in separating militants from the tribals and in supporting local militias ( lashkars ) . 
The police , [ORG Frontier Constabulary  ] and [ORG Frontier Corps  ] should be given personnel carriers , weapons , bullet-proof jackets , and training , [PER Gilani  ] urged .

( C ) “What more proof do you need from us that we are allies against terrorism ? , ” [PER Gilani  ] asked ; after all , [LOC Pakistan  ] had lost more soldiers ( and civilians ) than coalition countries combined , he claimed . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] had also taken an economic hit because of its front-line status in the war on terror . 
International investment had dried up and domestic capital was being transferred out , he worried . 
He did thank , however , the “Friends of [MISC Pakistan”  ] for their support for an international financing program. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Senator [PER Snowe  ] reiterated [ORG USG  ] support for Pakistan’s return to democracy and noted the degree to which [MISC Pakistanis  ] had suffered in the war on terror . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] was a “key ISLAMABAD 00003586 002 OF 002 ally , ” she added , and both countries must agree on a “common approach to our common enemy.” A new [LOC U.S.  ] administration was an opportunity for a “reassessment of our joint strategy.” [PER Snowe  ] also noted the high opinion in the [LOC U.S.  ] and within the [ORG USG  ] for Pakistan’s new civilian administration , the [PER Army’s Kayani  ] , and [PER Inter-Services Intelligence’s  ] ( ISI ) [ORG Pasha  ] , and pointed to the establishment of border coordination centers as positive developments .

All sides needed to “get past petty matters” in order to tackle the terrorism “destroying us all.” <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 .

Also , the [ORG GOA  ] had not agreed to biometric-based controls at the border crossings. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Gilani  ] asked the [LOC U.S.  ] to release to [MISC GOP  ] custody Dr. [PER Aafia Siddiqui  ] , a [MISC Pakistani  ] arrested in and deported from [LOC Afghanistan  ] on charges of assaulting a [LOC U.S.  ] law enforcement officer . 
[PER Gilani  ] argued that the needs of her family and reports of her being ill provided humanitarian grounds for such a transfer .
