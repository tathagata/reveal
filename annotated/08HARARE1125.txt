END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) In response to a request from [ORG Crisis Management Support  ] , and following up on Embassy Harare’s December 2 [ORG EAC  ] ( Ref A ) , Post’s [ORG EAC  ] met on December 15 to specifically review Post’s tripwires in relation to the cholera epidemic in [LOC Zimbabwe  ] and the collapse of medical services . 
Management , medical and [ORG USAID Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance  ] ( [ORG OFDA  ] ) staff provided context for the discussion by describing the nature of the crisis and Post’s response to date ( Ref B ) . 
The [ORG EAC  ] used the meeting to review tripwires broadly in relation to the deteriorating political situation in [LOC Zimbabwe  ] as well . 
[ORG RSO  ] noted that Embassy [LOC Harare  ] has been in the “Growing Potential for Drawdown” category since the surge in political violence in March of 2007 ( Ref C ) . 
Since that time , the [ORG EAC  ] has regularly reviewed and revised precautionary measures depending on the immediate threats facing Post personnel . 
These reviews have focused on political , security and logistical issues , but have not in the past tested the adequacy of Post ‘s medical tripwires. --------- Tripwires --------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Post’s  ] tripwires for medical threats distinguish between the seriousness and the susceptibility to control of a medical epidemic . 
The three tripwires for “Growing Potential , ” “Authorized Departure” and “Ordered Departure” are: --There is an outbreak of a medical epidemic that could pose a direct risk to post personnel and private [MISC American  ] citizens . 
-- There is an outbreak of a medical epidemic that can be controlled but still poses a serious medical risk to post personnel and dependents and [MISC American  ] citizens. --An outbreak of a medical epidemic that cannot be controlled and poses a serious medical risk to post personnel and dependents and [MISC American  ] citizens occurs. -------------- Where We Stand -------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) Post’s medical officer and the [ORG USAID  ] [ORG OFDA  ] representative explained to the [ORG EAC  ] that cholera is a preventable disease that spreads where hygiene is poor . 
In [LOC Zimbabwe  ] the breakdown in public services means that untreated sewage and garbage litter the streets of high-density neighborhoods while supplies of clean water have been cut off . 
This creates optimal conditions for rapid spread among individuals who live in these areas and have no access to clean water , soap , or water treatment . 
Cholera is also a readily treatable disease , but lack of health services has resulted in an unusually high mortality rate in [LOC Zimbabwe.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) [ORG EAC  ] members noted that Post’s tripwires do not provide a clear dividing line between risk and serious risk . 
Medical and [ORG OFDA  ] staff stressed that the role of hygiene in the transmission of cholera means that , as long as employees and [MISC American  ] citizens have access to water which they can treat , the risk to [MISC Americans  ] from cholera is easily mitigated . 
Consular staff reported that they view the breakdown in health infrastructure as a threat to the safety of [MISC Americans  ] in [LOC Harare  ] , but their concern focuses on trauma , more than on cholera . 
Both prevention and treatment protocols for cholera are simple and well understood by the community . 
[ORG EAC  ] members agreed that the risk posed by cholera is not currently “serious” for these reasons . 
The [ORG EAC  ] believed that , the risk would become serious , and would merit authorized departure , if members of the official community were not able to obtain water . 
Without adequate water , [ORG Post  ] would be unable to control the spread of cholera to the [ORG Mission  ] community. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) The [ORG EAC  ] discussed [ORG Post’s  ] logistics tripwires and noted that , for the time being , the Embassy has been able to [LOC HARARE  ] 00001125 002 OF 002 ameliorate the impact of the collapse of [LOC Zimbabwe’s  ] infrastructure . 
Although [ORG Post  ] does not anticipate that the collapse will outstrip Post’s ability to cope , the [ORG EAC  ] considers this risk particularly pertinent to the sustainability of a large [ORG USG  ] presence and has continued to seek possible measures to make Embassy coping mechanisms more robust . 
( Lack of water , even without a cholera epidemic , would justify authorized departure , according to existing tripwires . 
) The [ORG EAC  ] also noted that , as we have been for some time , [ORG Post  ] is in the “Growing Potential for Drawdown” category with respect to tripwires for Police and [ORG Security Forces  ] , Political , and Media environment as well. --------- Responses --------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) The [ORG EAC  ] reviewed responses to the threat already carried out , including: --Issuance of a [MISC Travel Warning.  ] --Distribution of information on precautions against and treatment of cholera. --Scheduling of a [ORG Town Hall  ] meeting for Embassy community at which the option of voluntary [ORG SMA  ] authorization will be raised. --Consultation with [ORG Harare International School.  ] --Ordering of hand sanitizer. --Closure to the public of [ORG Post’s Public Affairs Section  ] when water is unavailable. --Revision of [ORG EAP  ] and [MISC F-77  ] lists. --Request for funding for additional well drilling surveys. --Request for provision of enhanced [ORG Post  ] medical unit facilities. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) Additional measures being initiated or endorsed by the [ORG EAC  ] include: --Procurement of additional satellite phones and repetition of messages advising employees that these phones may be requested for in-country travel. --Drafting evacuation travel orders for all newly-arrived employees and ensuring all have valid visas for [LOC Zambia.  ] --Review of additional options for emergency evacuation. --Procurement of water treatment supplies for [ORG LES  ] employees. --Request for funding to procure an additional water truck and hire an additional driver . 
( [ORG See Action Request  ] para 10 . 
) --Request for consideration of funding to procure a reverse osmosis water pumping unit . 
( [ORG See Action Request  ] para 11 . 
) <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) The [ORG EAC  ] considered but did not endorse the following measures at this time ; they will be reviewed in subsequent [LOC EACs:  ] --In-country travel restrictions or restrictions on TDY visitors. --An additional [ORG Town Hall  ] meeting for [MISC American  ] citizens. --Restrictions on public functions. --------------- Action Requests --------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) [ORG Mission  ] facilities and residences are kept supplied with water by two water trucks currently operating eight hours per day , seven days a week . 
Embassy employees are advised to conserve water , but there is no rationing enforced . 
If one of the trucks were to break down or if many more of our wells dried up , water use restrictions would have to be imposed , and authorized departure might be necessary . 
To reduce this risk , [ORG Post  ] requests funds to obtain an additional water truck and hire an additional driver. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) Embassy employees rely on distilled water for drinking . 
Public utility and well water are used without treatment for all other purposes . 
If water supplies deteriorated severely in both quantity and quality , [ORG Post  ] might need to rely on lakes or other poor quality water sources . 
This would likely trigger a request for ordered departure , depending on the severity of the situation . 
Procurement of a reverse osmosis water purification unit would enable [ORG Post  ] to serve the needs of remaining staff .
