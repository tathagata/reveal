( U ) As a result of the international financial crisis and lack of liquidity in the credit markets , the [MISC Icelandic  ] krona ( [ORG ISK  ] ) has taken a beating , falling almost 50 percent since the start of the year . 
On September 17 the [ORG ISK  ] trade weighted index , which measures the price in [ORG ISK  ] of a weighted average of the currencies of [LOC Iceland  ] 's biggest trade partners , hit a record high . 
There is consensus among most [MISC Icelandic  ] experts that the [ORG ISK  ] has hit close to bottom , but none predict when it will start strengthening. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) [LOC Iceland  ] is very dependent on imports and the exchange rate has a large influence on prices of consumer goods . 
The 12-month inflation rate now measures at 14.5 percent . 
Many Icelanders are also feeling the pinch as their monthly payments on foreign currency loans -- a common instrument for car loans and mortgages -- have risen dramatically. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Calls for adopting the [MISC Euro  ] have increased as the [ORG ISK  ] has slipped . 
Prominent members of the [ORG Progressive Party  ] , an opposition party in Parliament , are proposing a referendum in early 2009 on joining the [ORG EU  ] . 
However , Prime Minister [PER Geir Haarde  ] continues to take what he calls a pragmatic approach to the currency issue and he believes the benefits of keeping the [ORG ISK  ] outweigh those of adopting the [MISC Euro  ] at this time .
