( U ) This is an action request , see para 8. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) Since July 2009 , Embassy [LOC Panama  ] has grappled with President [PER Martinelli  ] 's desire to involve the [ORG USG  ] in his efforts to construct a wiretap program that would target his domestic political opponents . 
[LOC Refs A  ] , B and C document the sequence of events in which the president and subordinates employed a variety of tactics ranging from straightforward requests to intimidating threats , in order to obtain [ORG USG  ] assistance and/or political cover for his wiretap project . 
Ample additional reporting on this topic is available in other agency channels. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) From the time of our very first discussion with the [MISC GOP  ] on this subject in July until now , we have clearly and consistently told all senior [MISC GOP  ] officials that the [ORG USG  ] will only conduct limited law enforcement wiretap programs in cooperation with [MISC Panamanian  ] law enforcement and judicial authorities , directed only against genuine law enforcement targets , in a process managed by a [MISC Panamanian  ] prosecutor and approved by a [MISC Panamanian  ] supreme court judge. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) Since our decision in late September ( Ref B ) to remove the [ORG DEA Matador  ] wiretap program from control of the [MISC GOP  ] 's Council for [ORG Public Security and National Defense  ] ( [ORG CSPDN  ] ) , we have confronted a series of obstacles , including threats from the [ORG CSPDN  ] director to expel the [ORG DEA  ] from [LOC Panama  ] ( Ref C ) and restrict payments to vetted units ( Ref G ) , and generally weak support for the move from [PER Martinelli  ] and senior [MISC GOP  ] leaders . 
[PER Martinelli  ] 's distrust of [LOC Panama  ] 's attorney general ( Ref D ) has complicated the issue and he and his subordinates have repeatedly proposed alternative arrangements that would keep the [ORG Matador  ] program within [ORG CSPDN  ] , but would not fully maintain the " firewall " between law enforcement and intelligence activities. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) We are still hopeful that we can complete the [ORG Matador  ] move out of [ORG CSPDN  ] early in the new year , but if we are unable to do so , we are faced with a difficult decision . 
If [ORG Matador  ] remains in [ORG CSPDN  ] , the [MISC GOP  ] will continue its efforts to change procedures to weaken judicial controls over the program . 
[ORG CSPDN  ] director [PER Olmedo Alfaro  ] has told Embassy officers that the [MISC GOP  ] plans to introduce legislation that would create a special judge to approve [MISC GOP  ] wiretap targets on short notice . 
With [LOC Panama  ] 's notoriously corrupt judicial system ( rated 103 out of 133 by the [ORG World Economic Forum  ] ) , we are not confident that the new judge will uphold the same standards and civil liberties protections that the [LOC Panama  ] supreme court has exercised in its oversight of [ORG Matador  ] to date. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) All of this comes at a time when [LOC Panama  ] 's judicial institutions are under assault by the executive , with [PER Martinelli  ] 's strong political pressure on the attorney general ( Ref D ) and the controversial appointment of two [PER Martinelli  ] political cronies to the supreme court ( septel ) . 
For several weeks the [MISC Panamanian  ] media has carried a steady stream of criticism of [PER Martinelli  ] 's actions , and most observers believe that the country 's already weak justice system is suffering serious body blows. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) The [ORG Matador  ] wiretap program is a valuable law enforcement tool , but we believe that the [ORG USG  ] must not compromise democratic values in the employment of that tool . 
The [LOC United States  ] itself has recently experienced a difficult debate over civil liberties and democratic principles being compromised in the name of security . 
We should not be a participant in questionable activities in [LOC Panama  ] . 
The recent [MISC DAS  ] scandal in [LOC Colombia  ] illustrates the catastrophic consequences of politically motivated wiretaps , and such a scenario could easily unfold in [LOC Panama  ] if the [MISC GOP  ] continues its present course of action . 
If we cannot guarantee with a high level of confidence that the [ORG Matador  ] program will not be misused for political purposes , then we prefer to suspend the program. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Post requests Department coordinate with other stakeholder agencies to provide advice on a way forward . 
While we at post are in the strongest position to provide views on the operational impact of suspending the program , stakeholder agencies in [LOC Washington  ] can best provide the perspective on the legal and policy factors against which the operational impact should be weighed . 
We will be pleased to provide extensive additional background material and technical details as requested .
