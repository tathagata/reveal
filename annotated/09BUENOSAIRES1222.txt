The Ambassador said [LOC Washington  ] remained fully committed to deepening and strengthening relations with [LOC Argentina  ] .

End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Mayor [PER Macri  ] received the Ambassador for an introductory call at [LOC City Hall  ] on November 9 . 
He was accompanied by his Secretary General [PER Marcos Pena  ] , international relations advisor [PER Diego Guelar  ] ( former ambassador to the [LOC United States  ] ) , and city international relations department chief [PER Fulvio Pompeo  ] . 
The Ambassador was accompanied by [ORG DCM  ] and polcouns ( notetaker ) . 
[PER Macri  ] 's Take on the [MISC Kirchners  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The Ambassador asked about relations between the city , the province and the federal government , particularly in coordinating police coverage and public security . 
[PER Macri  ] bluntly said , " There are no relations with the [PER Kirchner  ] administration at all . 
" He said he would be meeting with President [PER Cristina Fernandez  ] de [PER Kirchner  ] later that day , but that it was only the second time in almost two years that they have met . 
He said the [ORG GOA  ] had not been receptive to city overtures to discuss jurisdiction responsibilities to be divided between the new metropolitan police force and the [ORG PFA  ] . 
Indeed , [PER Macri  ] said he suspected the [ORG GOA  ] was deliberately fostering havoc in the streets in order to sabotage his new metropolitan police force from the outset. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The Ambassador said she had noticed in the press that a judge had dismissed charges against ( [MISC Kirchner-allied  ] " piquetero " social activist ) [PER Luis D'Elia  ] for seizing a police station despite the strong evidence against him , including videotape of [PER D'Elia  ] . 
[PER Macri  ] said he considered the court ruling a prime example of judicial susceptibility to intimidation , but he also said he believed the decision would be appealed. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The Ambassador noted that [PER Macri  ] , like many other [MISC Argentines  ] she had spoken with , had used the word " fear " in describing the current political climate . 
[PER Macri  ] said the [MISC Kirchners  ] often succeeded by bullying their opponents and critics , but now that 80% of the [MISC Argentine  ] public reject the [MISC Kirchners  ] , he thought the media were pushing back against the [MISC Kirchners  ] where political and business leaders had not . 
He reprised an earlier conversation with then-WHA [PER A/S Shannon  ] regarding the need to set limits on the [MISC Kirchners'  ] misbehavior and the [ORG USG  ] 's supposed " softness " on the [MISC Kirchners  ] . 
He argued that the [ORG USG  ] 's " silence " on the abusive mistreatment it suffered at the hands of the [MISC Kirchners  ] ( such as at the 2005 [LOC Mar del Plata Summit  ] of the [ORG Americas  ] ) had encouraged more of the same. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Macri  ] also ridiculed the [MISC Kirchners  ] for touting an economic " model " that had left 30% of [MISC Argentines  ] in poverty . 
" What kind of model is that ? 
" he asked. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Macri  ] said the [MISC Kirchners  ] had succeeded in alienating [LOC Washington  ] to the point where [LOC Washington  ] did not care what [LOC Argentina  ] ( unlike [LOC Brazil  ] or [LOC Chile  ] ) had to say about anything . 
The Ambassador sought to disabuse [PER Macri  ] of that notion , arguing that [LOC Washington  ] remained fully committed to deepening and strengthening relations with [LOC Argentina  ] . 
She pointed out that [LOC Washington  ] was keenly aware of [LOC Argentina  ] 's position in the world as an agricultural powerhouse and of [MISC Argentine  ] cooperation , actual and potential . 
As an example , she cited [LOC Argentina  ] 's role in developing satellites to be launched by [ORG NASA  ] as evidence of [LOC Washington  ] 's appreciation for the high-tech value that [LOC Argentina  ] could bring to bear . 
[PER Macri  ] 's Running ! ---------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) In discussing agricultural trade , [PER Macri  ] let slip his presidential ambitions for 2011 . 
He said beef exports may not be an issue for the [MISC Kirchners  ] ( because they want to keep beef at home ) , but beef will be an issue for him in a couple of years ( i.e. , when he is president ) . 
New [ORG Embassy Building  ] ? --------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Macri  ] also asked about [ORG USG  ] plans to relocate the [ORG Embassy  ] and referred to a previous offer to provide a site for a new office building . 
( The site is located in downtown [LOC Buenos Aires  ] , less than two miles from the [PER Casa Rosada  ] , in an old industrial area that the city wishes to develop into an upscale neighborhood that would include a number of Embassies -- see 08 [LOC Buenos Aires  ] 1564 . 
) The Ambassador and [ORG DCM  ] explained ( as we did in late 2008 after consulting with [LOC Washington  ] ) that the Department was committed to finding a site that would conform to new security requirements , but that the size of the project and more pressing demands elsewhere meant that it would be several more years before the project could get underway in [LOC Buenos Aires  ] . 
Comment ------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The meeting was another reminder of [PER Macri  ] 's directness , his Manichean view of the world , and his discomfort with the niceties of interpersonal communication ( he cut off the meeting abruptly after about twenty minutes ) . 
These are all qualities that he shares with [PER Nestor Kirchner  ] , his bitter political rival . 
[PER Macri  ] 's insistence that the [ORG USG  ] publicly reproach the [MISC Kirchners  ] for their various transgressions suggests an unrealistic desire that [LOC Washington  ] do the opposition 's bidding . 
Nonetheless , the mayor remains one of the top contenders for the 2011 presidential race ( arguably the second most competitive candidate , after Vice President [PER Julio Cobos  ] ) . 
We will continue to engage him actively as the elections approach .
