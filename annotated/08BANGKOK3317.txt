SUMMARY AND COMMENT ------------------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) King [PER Bhumibol  ] explicitly told Army Commander [PER Anupong Paojinda  ] not to launch a coup , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , an advisor to Queen [PER Sirikit  ] , told Ambassador November 4 . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also claimed that the Queen had not meant to signal support for the [ORG People’s Alliance for Democracy  ] ( [ORG PAD  ] ) anti-government agenda when she presided over funeral ceremonies on October 13 . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said PAD’s activities had irritated the King , who reportedly wants [ORG PAD  ] protestors to leave Government [ORG House  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] spoke well of Prime Minister [PER Somchai Wongsawat  ] , saying [PER Somchai  ] was open to compromising with the [ORG PAD  ] , although [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] guessed [PER Somchai  ] would be forced from office by the end of the year . 
Separately , a politically active businessman with strong connections to the palace told us that the [MISC Queen’s  ] funeral appearance had hurt the monarchy’s image , thereby serving the agenda of former Prime Minister [PER Thaksin Shinawatra  ] . 
This contact also discussed a possible assassination plot against [PER Thaksin  ] and [ORG PAD  ] plans for violence . 
Both contacts claimed the King suffered from back pain and his condition was frail. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Comment: XXXXXXXXXXXX’s claim that the King instructed [PER Anupong  ] not to conduct a coup is the strongest account we have heard to date about the King’s opposition to a coup and his communicating this to [PER Anupong  ] ; it would explain why [ORG Privy Counselors Prem and Siddhi  ] , both seen as opponents of the current government , gave recent assurances to the Ambassador that there would not be a coup . 
While [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] did not specify how he heard of this exchange , the purported instruction does appear consistent with [MISC Anupong’s  ] actions , other high-level military assurances to the Ambassador , and reporting in other channels . 
We agree that the [MISC Queen’s  ] funeral appearance was a significant blunder , jeopardizing the public’s perception of the palace’s neutrality . 
[ORG PAD  ] appears increasingly divided ; this divide , as well as the intense and dynamic condition of [MISC Thai  ] politics , may make it appear realistic to hope for a PAD-government compromise . 
Possible further violence , however , remains a concern . 
End Summary and Comment . 
PALACE-PAD RELATIONS -------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Ambassador met privately at the [LOC Residence  ] on November 4 with [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , a close advisor to Queen [PER Sirikit  ] who in the past has also served as a confidant of the [MISC King.XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] remarked that he regretted the [MISC Queen’s  ] October 13 appearance at the funeral of a [ORG PAD  ] supporter ( ref D ) . 
He claimed the [ORG Queen had  ] been emotionally affected when she learned that one victim of the October 7 violence was a young lady about to be married , and that she had told her father she was going to the protest to defend the monarchy . 
Initially , the [ORG Queen had  ] wanted to send Princess [PER Chulabhorn  ] to the funeral . 
It was only at the request of [PER Chulabhorn  ] and Chulabhorn’s companion , [PER Chaichon Locharernkul  ] , that the [ORG Queen decided  ] to go herself . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said there was no intention for the [ORG Queen to  ] involve either herself or the monarchy in political matters , but , unfortunately , some members of the public could interpret the funeral appearance differently . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the [ORG Queen later  ] reached out to seriously injured police officers in an attempt to show her neutrality , but this signal went largely unnoticed. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] remarked that King [PER Bhumibol  ] was highly irritated by PAD’s occupation of Government [ORG House  ] and other disruptions caused by the anti-government group , but the King was unsure how best to ensure [ORG PAD  ] would vacate the compound . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the King had instructed two of his loyalists to convey his desire that [ORG PAD  ] leave Government [ORG House  ] . 
( One of these messengers was well-known associate of the King Disathorn [LOC BANGKOK  ] 00003317 002.2 OF 003 Watcharothai , who said publicly on October 29 that Thais who love the King should “go home” ; see ref A . 
) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] considered [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] to be obstinate , however , saying [PER Sondhi  ] had become obsessed with his own sense of mission . 
By contrast , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] thought that [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was reasonable and willing to compromise . 
POSITIVE VIEW OF [PER SOMCHAI  ] ------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] claimed to have spoken to Prime Minister [PER Somchai Wongsawat  ] about the current standoff . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told the Ambassador that [PER Somchai  ] had agreed that the government could meet with the [ORG PAD  ] and reach a compromise , but the time was not yet ripe . 
In his conversation with the Ambassador , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] spoke highly of [PER Somchai  ] , saying he was “very good” and had many qualities that made him suitable to be Prime Minister , including a sense of fairness and a moderate temperament . 
Nevertheless , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] predicted that [PER Somchai  ] could not remain long in office because he would likely be forced out by an adverse [ORG Constitutional Court  ] ruling in the [ORG People’s Power Party  ] ( [ORG PPP  ] ) dissolution case ( ref A ) , which [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believed the Court might issue before the King’s birthday ( December 5 ) . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] guessed [PER Somchai  ] would dissolve the parliament before being forced from office . 
KING TO ANUPONG: NO COUP ------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] predicted that the current turmoil would not result in a military coup . 
He said that the King , speaking with Army Commander [PER Anupong Paojinda  ] , had referred to the 2006 coup and made a statement to the effect that there should be no further coups . 
POLITICIZATION OF THE MONARCHY ------------------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) We also met on November 5 with [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ( strictly protect ) , the well-connected scion of a wealthy family with close palace ties . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] had a leading role in the [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ; his wife , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , has the royal title of “XXXXXXXXXXXX” and works closely with the Queen . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] agreed that the [MISC Queen’s  ] appearance at the October 13 funeral had highly negative ramifications , saying that even politically neutral Thais felt she had inappropriately brought the monarchy into politics . 
He also acknowledged increasing semi-public criticism of the monarchy , focused on the [ORG Queen ( septel  ] ) . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated with confidence that the King had sought to deter the Queen from attending the funeral by questioning the wisdom of that plan , but had stopped short of forbidding her to do so. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] discussed former Prime Minister [ORG Thaksin’s  ] statement in his November 1 address to supporters ( ref B ) that either “royal mercy or the people’s power” could allow his return to [LOC Thailand  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said this juxtaposition , which he viewed as highly strategic , had the predictable effect of energizing [ORG Thaksin’s  ] opponents in the royalist camp . 
This reaction allowed [PER Thaksin  ] to demonstrate publicly that many palace figures were aligned against him , thereby eroding the prestige that the palace derived from its status as an institution above politics . 
( Separately , after [ORG Thaksin’s  ] remarks , a member of [ORG Thaksin’s  ] legal team told us that the sentence in question was part of a “very refined product” and that she had heard this sentence “four or five times” in [ORG Thaksin’s  ] rehearsal of the speech . 
) [ORG THAKSIN’S  ] ENEMIES’ PLANS FOR VIOLENCE ------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believed [ORG PAD  ] continued to aim for a violent clash that would spark a coup . 
He asserted that he had dined on October 6 with a leading [ORG PAD  ] figure ( [ORG NFI  ] ) , who explained that [ORG PAD  ] would provoke violence during its October 7 protest at the parliament . 
The unnamed [ORG PAD  ] figure predicted ( wrongly ) that the Army would intervene against the [LOC BANGKOK  ] 00003317 003.2 OF 003 government by the evening of October 7 . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] asserted to us that [ORG PAD  ] remained intent on a conflict that would generate at least two dozen deaths and make military intervention appear necessary and justified. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) We mentioned to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] the claim by [PER Thaksin  ] associate [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that [PER Thaksin  ] had been the target of an assassination plot ( ref C ) . 
( Note: Subsequent to the [MISC Ambassador’s  ] meeting with [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , another [PER Thaksin  ] ally related the same claim , and said [PER Thaksin  ] himself had spoken of this plot . 
End Note . 
) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] suggested XXXXXXXXXXXX’s list of conspirators -- including two prominent judges -- was not credible , but [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he could confirm ( presumably because of first-hand discussion with an organizing figure ) that certain enemies of [PER Thaksin  ] ( [ORG NFI  ] ) had sought to kill him . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he had been surprised to learn that the contract on [ORG Thaksin’s  ] life entailed a relatively low payment of only several hundred thousand Baht ( in the range of 10,000 USD ) , although it also entailed resettlement abroad for the person ( s ) directly involved . 
REMARKS ON THE KING’S HEALTH ---------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ( late [PER August/early September  ] ) . 
At that time , he said , the King’s complexion appeared healthy , but overall the King appeared frail . 
He added that the King was upset with the [MISC Thai  ] doctor who had organized the team that performed back surgery on the King two years ago , as the operation had not worked as well as the King had been led to expect . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , in his meeting with the Ambassador , also said the King was suffering from back pain , and his activities were more limited than in recent years .
