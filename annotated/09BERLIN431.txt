( S ) SUMMARY . 
The new [LOC U.S.  ] strategy for [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] has been warmly received in [LOC Germany  ] and has engendered considerable good will , but it has thus far yielded only a few additional commitments from [LOC Berlin  ] -- the chief of which is a contribution of 50 million [MISC Euros  ] to the [ORG Afghan National Army  ] ( [ORG ANA  ] ) [ORG Trust Fund  ] . 
While [MISC German  ] officials agree that the effort in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , especially on the civilian side , needs to be ramped up , they believe that [LOC Germany  ] -- as the third largest troop contributor and fourth largest donor -- is already doing more in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] has made clear in a number of public speeches and comments recently that [LOC Germany  ] feels no compunction to significantly expand its effort in [LOC Afghanistan  ] in the near term , beyond what it was already planning to do . 
While the [MISC German  ] effort -- especially in terms of ground troops -- is likely to remain concentrated in the north for the foreseeable future , there are ongoing discussions in the [MISC German  ] government about what impact the eventual transfer of lead security responsibility ( [ORG TLSR  ] ) to the [MISC Afghans  ] in the north should have on the current disposition of [MISC German  ] forces . 
While [ORG MOD  ] reportedly argues that [ORG TLSR  ] should have no impact , [MISC German  ] Special Envoy Muetzelburg believes it should allow some [MISC German  ] forces to be shifted to the west of the country . 
Other [MISC German  ] officials think that in the longer term , [LOC Germany  ] should consider teaming up with the [LOC Netherlands  ] in [LOC Uruzgan Province  ] , since the two countries share the same philosophical approach in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
But none of these bolder ideas for increased [MISC German  ] engagement are likely to be considered or debated seriously until after the September Bundestag election . 
END SUMMARY . 
DEMARCHE <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Post delivered the talking points , civilian assistance non-paper and requests for specific [MISC German  ] contributions contained in ref A to the [ORG MOD  ] , MFA , [ORG Interior Ministry  ] ( [ORG MOI  ] ) , [ORG Chancellery  ] and [ORG Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development  ] ( [ORG BMZ  ] ) in separate meetings on April 2 , 3 and 6 . 
GENERAL REACTION <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) All the [MISC German  ] officials with whom we spoke warmly welcomed the new [LOC U.S.  ] strategy for [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] , with several viewing it as an affirmation of [LOC Germany  ] 's own networked security or comprehensive approach . 
[ORG Chancellery Afghanistan Desk  ] Officer [PER Irina Speck  ] noted that the new [LOC U.S.  ] strategy had not only been well-received in [LOC Europe  ] , but also in the [MISC Muslim  ] world , including [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
She said the new tone and the willingness to be self-critical were very much appreciated . 
Only a few concerns were raised . 
[ORG BMZ Afghanistan Desk  ] Officer [PER Martin Kipping  ] wondered , for example , if the President 's emphasis on counterterrorism action meant that the [LOC U.S.  ] was scaling down its ambitions to help [MISC Afghans  ] build a fully democratic state . 
He seemed relieved to hear that the [LOC U.S.  ] was not abandoning its long-term goals for [LOC Afghanistan  ] , but simply establishing short- and medium-term goals to better focus its engagement over the next three to five years . 
Regarding the planned deployment of more than 20,000 additional [LOC U.S.  ] troops to the south , [ORG Chancellery Military Affairs Chief Col.  ] [PER Erich Vad  ] thought one likely result would be an influx of insurgents northward into the [MISC German  ] area responsibility . 
He said the [MISC Bundeswehr  ] would have to expect more attacks and security incidents in the north as a result of this squeezing effect in the south. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The reaction to the [LOC U.S  ] requests for specific [MISC German  ] contribution was also largely positive . 
[MISC German  ] officials were clearly relieved , for example , that we had taken [MISC German  ] domestic political realities into account and were not asking for [MISC German  ] combat forces to be deployed outside the north . 
At the same time , our requests have yielded only a few additional commitments thus far . 
While [MISC German  ] officials agree that the effort in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , especially on the civilian side , needs to be ramped up , they believe that [LOC Germany  ] is already doing its fair share in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
They point out that [LOC Germany  ] is not only the third largest troop contributor ( with 3,900 troops currently deployed , a few hundred more on the way and authorization to go up to 4,500 ) , it is also the fourth largest donor ( with a total of 170.7 million [MISC Euros  ] committed to civilian reconstruction , economic development and humanitarian assistance in 2009 -- 80 million [MISC Euros  ] from [ORG BMZ  ] and 90.7 million from the [ORG MFA  ] ) . <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The problem , as [MISC German  ] officials see it , is not that they need to do more , but that they need to do a better job of publicizing what they are already doing . 
As Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] has made clear in a number of public speeches and comments recently , [LOC Germany  ] feels no compunction to significantly expand its effort in the near term . 
Her belief is that , in the context of last October 's renewal of the parliamentary mandate for the [MISC Bundeswehr  ] 's participation in [LOC ISAF  ] , [LOC Germany  ] has already taken a number of measures to boost its military and civilian engagement . 
She sees no reason to re-examine this issue again until the [LOC ISAF  ] mandate comes back up for renewal , which has been deliberately set for December , safely after the Bundestag election in September. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In private , [MISC Germans  ] tell us that they are our most reliable partner because they , unlike the [MISC Dutch  ] and [MISC Canadians  ] , have committed themselves to staying indefinitely in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and have not publicly announced a withdrawal date , notwithstanding the low [MISC German  ] public support for the mission . 
( In a recent [MISC German  ] magazine poll , 61 percent answered no to the question: Should the [MISC Bundeswehr  ] remain stationed in [LOC Afghanistan  ] ? 
This tracks with INR surveys , which show that 58% oppose the [MISC Bundeswehr  ] 's participation in [LOC ISAF  ] and only 39% support it . 
) When it is pointed out that [LOC Germany  ] may never get credit for bearing its full share of the burden in [LOC Afghanistan  ] as long as it refuses to send combat troops outside of the relatively peaceful north , the answer is a helpless shrug and the comment: We can live with that. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Detailed [MISC German  ] responses to ref A 's requests for specific contributions are provided in paras 8-23 . 
RC-NORTH ELECTION SUPPORT FORCE <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG MFA ISAF Action  ] officer [PER Lukas Wasielewski  ] noted that [LOC Sweden  ] and [LOC Norway  ] had just announced that they could not provide the promised forces to augment their PRTs during the upcoming [MISC Afghan  ] election . 
As a result , there is now suddenly a shortfall of four platoons -- or about 120 soldiers -- for election support in the north . 
( As reported ref B , [PER Wasielewski  ] had highlighted previously that the requirements for election support in the north were completely fulfilled . 
) [PER Wasielewski  ] could not make any promises , but said that [LOC Germany  ] was considering stepping in to fill the gap . 
FOCUSED DISTRICT DEVELOPMENT <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) As reported ref B , [LOC Germany  ] only began its participation in the focused district development ( [ORG FDD  ] ) police training program in January , but based on the very positive results so far , it is already considering a significant expansion of its effort , from the currently planned 10 districts to 20 . 
[ORG MFA Afghanistan-Pakistan Task Force  ] Director [PER Ruediger Koenig  ] thought [LOC Germany  ] 's decision to be the first country to join the [LOC U.S.  ] on [ORG FDD  ] demonstrated its unique reliability as a partner . 
[PER Helmut Teichmann  ] , [ORG MOI Office  ] Director for [ORG International Police Affairs  ] , indicated that [LOC Germany  ] , s goal of reaching 20 [ORG FDD  ] districts by spring 2010 would be facilitated by the opening of a new police training center in [LOC Kunduz  ] this July . 
[PER Teichmann  ] , who just back from a visit to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , noted that the building of a border police academy in [LOC Kabul  ] was behind schedule and might not be opened until spring 2010 . 
When completed , the academy will train 500 students a year . 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Several of our [MISC German  ] interlocutors noted that [LOC Germany  ] is already quite active in efforts to improve the [MISC Afghan  ] criminal justice system . 
According to the [ORG MFA Afghanistan  ] action officer responsible for civilian reconstruction , [PER Christian Dokter  ] , the [ORG MFA  ] spends about 2.5 million [MISC Euros  ] a year on a variety of legal training projects and support programs , while [ORG BMZ  ] spends about 3 million [PER Euros  ] . 
The [MISC BMZ-funded  ] rule of law programs include support for legal aid offices and a project to improve cooperation between police and state prosecutors in handling criminal cases. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) One of the main [ORG MFA  ] programs is a legal training program run by the [ORG Max Planck Institute  ] at the [ORG University of Heidelberg  ] , which conducts workshops in [LOC Afghanistan  ] for lawyers and judges and which also prepares legal texts and commentaries in [LOC Dari  ] and [LOC Pashtu  ] on the [MISC Afghan  ] constitution and [MISC Afghan  ] laws . 
Doktor said the program had been primarily focused in the north and [LOC Kabul  ] up to now , but that courses in 2009 would be extended for the first time to [MISC Afghans  ] who live in the south and east . 
He estimated that more than 2,000 [MISC Afghan  ] jurists had been trained since the start of this program in 2005 . 
[ORG ANA  ] TRUST FUND <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) FM Steinmeier announced at the May 31 [LOC Afghanistan  ] Conference in The [LOC Hague  ] that [LOC Germany  ] would contribute 50 million [MISC Euros  ] to the [ORG ANA Trust Fund  ] in 2009 . 
Both [ORG MFA  ] and Chancellery officials heralded the contribution as the biggest one to date and especially significant for a country that is also the third largest troop contributor . 
[ORG MFA ISAF Action  ] Officer [PER Wasielewski  ] emphasized , however , that the commitment was for 2009 only . 
With Bundestag elections in September , a decision on future contributions to the [ORG Trust Fund  ] in 2010 and beyond will be left to the next government . 
That said , [PER Wasielewski  ] thought it likely that [LOC Germany  ] would continue to contribute to the [ORG Trust Fund  ] at the current level , if not higher . 
He noted that the 2009 contribution had come out of the government 's general finance fund , rather than out of any particular ministry 's budget . 
[ORG ELECTRICAL POWER  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG BMZ Afghanistan Desk  ] Officer [PER Kipping  ] noted that renewable energy is one of [ORG BMZ  ] 's four priority areas in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and that it has already budgeted 27 million [PER Euros  ] to build one hydropower station in [LOC Kunduz  ] ( [LOC Khanabad  ] ) and two in [LOC Badakhshan  ] ( [LOC Keshem  ] and [LOC Feyzabad  ] ) . 
[PER Kipping  ] also noted that the [ORG BMZ  ] has made some 5 million [PER Euros  ] available to support micro hydropower projects for small , isolated communities that would not be able to connect to a central grid , as is the case in much of [LOC Badakhshan  ] . 
As far as the [ORG Northern Electric Power System  ] is concerned , [ORG BMZ  ] has committed some 24.4 million [PER Euros  ] to the construction of power stations and transmission lines . 
OMLTS <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As reported ref B , [LOC Germany  ] , in cooperation with its northern partners , has committed to fulfill by the end of the year all of the OMLT requirements for the two brigades of the 209th [ORG Afghan National Army  ] ( [ORG ANA  ] ) [ORG Corps  ] based in the north. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Regarding the possibility of allowing [MISC German  ] OMLTs to deploy outside the north , at least into [LOC RC-West  ] , both [ORG MOD  ] and [ORG MFA  ] claimed that they saw little practical necessity for [MISC German  ] OMLTs to do this . 
[ORG MOD Political-Military Affairs  ] Director Col. [PER Bernd Schuett  ] said that the 209h [ORG ANA Corps  ] was responsible for the northern region , and the [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG MOD  ] had indicated no interest in re-deploying it or its subordinate units to other areas of the country . 
The 209th [ORG Corps  ] was supposed to stay and operate in the north. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [ORG MFA ISAF Action  ] Officer [PER Wasielewski  ] claimed that apart from a single instance in 2006 , there had been no concrete proposals by the [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG MOD  ] to send [ORG ANA  ] Kandaks based in the north to other regions of the country -- even temporarily . 
[PER Schuett  ] emphasized that while [MISC German  ] OMLTs ( like any [MISC German  ] unit ) could , in theory , be deployed outside the north under an exception in the Bundeswehr 's parliamentary mandate , such deployments had to be limited both in time and scope , and judged to be absolutely indispensable to the success of the [ORG ISAF  ] mission . 
The [MISC German  ] minister of defense himself had to make this determination . 
Both [PER Schuett  ] and [PER Wasielewski  ] agreed that there was little likelihood that [MISC German  ] OMLTs would be deployed outside the north on this basis. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) With regard to the district of [LOC Gormach  ] , which was provisionally transferred from the [LOC RC-West  ] province of [LOC Badghis  ] to the [LOC RC-North  ] province of [LOC Faryab  ] last November based on a presidential decree , [PER Schuett  ] and [PER Wasielewski  ] emphasized that [LOC Germany  ] still considered the district to be part of [LOC RC-West  ] , even though [ORG ISAF HQ  ] has given [LOC RC-North  ] operational responsibility for it . 
Therefore , [MISC German  ] forces -- including OMLTs -- can only operate in [LOC Gormach  ] under the exception in the parliamentary mandate . 
GERMANS TO THE WEST AFTER TSLR IN THE NORTH ? <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In the context of the discussion about [MISC German  ] OMLTs operating in [LOC RC-West  ] , [PER Wasielewski  ] revealed that there are ongoing discussions in the [MISC German  ] government about what impact the eventual transfer of lead security responsibility ( [ORG TLSR  ] ) to the [MISC Afghans  ] will or should have on the disposition of [MISC German  ] forces in the north . 
[PER Wasielewski  ] said the [ORG MOD  ] position -- especially that of Bundeswehr CHOD Gen. [PER Schneiderhan  ] -- is that [ORG TLSR  ] should have no impact . 
[ORG MOD  ] argues that [MISC German  ] forces are already at minimal levels in the north , given the size of the area of responsibility , and that they need to remain in place to support/mentor [ORG Afghan National Security Forces  ] ( [ORG ANSF  ] ) . <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Wasielewski  ] said that Special MFA Envoy for [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] [PER Bernd Muetzelburg  ] sees it differently , believing that [ORG TLSR  ] should open the opportunity to shift some of [LOC Germany  ] 's forces to the west , especially to the neglected northern portion of the region . 
[PER Wasielewski  ] noted that [LOC RC-West  ] is largely preoccupied with the difficult security situation in [LOC Farah  ] , and does not have the troops to provide a sufficient presence elsewhere . 
[PER Wasielewski  ] pointed out that one could argue that such a shift in Bundeswehr forces would be in [LOC Germany  ] 's own self-interest , since this area is believed to be one of main infiltration routes for insurgents moving north . 
[PER Wasielewski  ] cautioned , however , that any such consideration will only be seriously entertained after the September Bundestag election . 
TEAMING UP WITH THE [MISC DUTCH  ] IN [MISC URUZGAN  ] ? <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Another longer-term possibility for [LOC Germany  ] 's engagement in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , according to Chancellery Chief of [ORG Military Affairs Col. Erich Vad  ] , is teaming with the [MISC Dutch  ] in [LOC Uruzgan Province  ] . 
[ORG Vad  ] noted that [LOC Germany  ] and the [LOC Netherlands  ] already have a close military relationship , as reflected in the joint [ORG German-Dutch Corps  ] based in [LOC Muenster  ] , and share the same military-civilian approach in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
But he ruled out any concrete steps in this direction before the Bundestag election . 
PRT CIVILIAN EXPERTS AND PROGRAMS <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) [MISC German  ] officials have long expressed skepticism about the efficacy of trying to create a strong central government in a country that has never had one , so they are very open to the new emphasis in the [LOC U.S.  ] strategy on engaging more at the provincial level . 
During her April 5-6 visit to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] met with Balkh Governor [PER Atta  ] and reportedly emphasized to him that more and more [MISC German  ] development projects would be agreed and carried out directly at the provincial level , because routing everything through [LOC Kabul  ] took too long. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) MFA Afghanistan-Pakistan [ORG Task Force  ] Director [PER Ruediger Koenig  ] told us noted that while [ORG BMZ  ] controls the bulk of [MISC German  ] development funds and operates largely independently , the [ORG MFA  ] civilian leader at each PRT has access to his or her own funds , which can be rapidly disbursed in support of hearts and minds projects of their choosing ( subject to approval in [LOC Berlin  ] ) . 
He noted , for example , that the civilian leader in [LOC Feyzabad  ] had a budget of about 500,000 [PER Euros  ] per year. <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( C ) [PER Koenig  ] also agreed on the need for more specialists at [LOC PRTs  ] , especially agricultural specialists , noting that he was already fighting for that with [MISC German  ] development agency [ORG GTZ  ] . 
He said [ORG MFA  ] was also pushing [ORG BMZ  ] to put more emphasis on supporting agriculture . 
Currently , agriculture is only addressed indirectly in the [ORG BMZ  ] plan for [LOC Afghanistan  ] , which focuses on three other priority areas , in addition to renewable energy: drinking water , education and economic development .
