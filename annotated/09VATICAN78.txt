REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) Mr. President , it’s an honor to welcome you and your family to the [LOC Vatican  ] , the world’s smallest sovereign state , and one with global clout . 
Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) [ORG Holy See  ] officials also are pleased you are visiting . 
Your meeting with [PER Pope Benedict XVI  ] will be an opportunity to discuss our shared commitments to overarching goals such as peace , justice , development , human dignity , and inter-faith understanding . 
From the [MISC Vatican’s  ] perspective , it will also provide a forum to discuss sensitive bioethical issues in a mutually respectful way . 
In your meeting with him , or possibly with other [LOC Vatican  ] officials on the margins , you may cover other topics of special interest , such as the [LOC Middle East  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] , immigration , and the environment . 
Your discussions at the [ORG Holy See  ] will help deepen our mutual collaboration on issues around the world . 
End Summary . 
Context for Your Visit ---------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) The [LOC Vatican  ] is second only to the [LOC United States  ] in the number of countries with which it enjoys diplomatic relations ( 188 and 177 respectively ) , and there are [MISC Catholic  ] priests , nuns and lay people in every country on the planet . 
As a result , the [ORG Holy See  ] is interested and well informed about developments all over the globe . 
This year marks the 25th anniversary of formal relations between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG Holy See  ] . 
The [ORG Holy See  ] is the global government of the [MISC Catholic  ] Church , which it operates from [LOC Vatican City State  ] , a sovereign territory of a quarter of a square mile. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) The [ORG Holy See  ] in many ways welcomed your election , as demonstrated by the [MISC Pope’s  ] immediate letter of congratulation . 
[LOC Vatican  ] officials have been impressed by many of your initiatives , especially on foreign policy . 
The [LOC Vatican  ] newspaper , the “Osservatore [PER Romano  ] , ” has welcomed your positions on the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] situation , outreach to [MISC Muslims  ] , disarmament , [LOC Cuba  ] and the environment . 
The [ORG Holy See  ] has appreciated your multilateralism and focus on human rights , including your decisions to run for the [ORG Human Rights Council  ] and close the [LOC Guantanamo  ] detainee facility . 
Nevertheless , although it does not generally express them publicly , the [LOC Vatican  ] also has profound concerns about your Administration’s positions on abortion and embryonic stem cell research . 
The [LOC Vatican  ] has allowed the [MISC American Catholic  ] Church to take the lead in enunciating these concerns . 
This is a tactical decision , and should not be interpreted as a divergence of views between [LOC Rome  ] and the [ORG U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops  ] ( [ORG USCCB  ] ) . 
The [LOC Vatican  ] trusts the [ORG USCCB  ] , is proud of the work that [MISC Catholic  ] organizations do in the [LOC U.S.  ] , and relies on the generosity of [MISC American Catholics  ] to support the [LOC Vatican  ] and [MISC Catholic  ] causes worldwide . 
On balance , the [LOC Vatican  ] regards your Presidency favorably and will seek to focus more on the areas of policy convergence between us than on the issues that divide us . 
[PER Pope Benedict XVI  ] ----------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) The [PER Pope  ] has had a rocky year , having confronted controversies about [MISC Catholic-Jewish  ] relations and his views on [MISC AIDS  ] prevention , and breakdowns in internal [LOC Vatican  ] communications related to the controversies . 
At the same time , he also took crucial , successful trips to the [LOC Middle East  ] and [LOC Africa  ] . 
He is looking forward to meeting you . 
The [PER Pope  ] genuinely likes [MISC Americans  ] and the [LOC United States  ] , and enjoyed his visit there last year . 
He admires the [LOC U.S.  ] model of secularism , where the church and state are separate but which he says “allows for professing belief in [PER God  ] and respects the public role of religion and churches.” The [PER Pope  ] has made promotion of international religious freedom a central objective of his papacy , and appreciates [LOC U.S.  ] support for this goal . 
As the spiritual leader of 1.3 billion [MISC Catholics  ] worldwide and enjoying [LOC VATICAN  ] 00000078 002.2 OF 005 respect as well from non-Catholics , the [PER Pope  ] wields an unparalleled moral megaphone . 
He uses it carefully , speaking publicly in generic , neutral terms about the need for peace and social justice rather than criticizing individual states . 
Behind closed doors , he sometimes takes on specific issues more directly . 
In that context , a [LOC Vatican  ] official had told us that the [PER Pope  ] probably will raise abortion , embryonic stem cell research , and social justice issues -- especially immigration -- with you . 
[ORG Bioethical Issues  ] ----------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) The [MISC Catholic  ] Church teaches that abortion is wrong . 
[LOC Vatican  ] officials grudgingly accept that abortion is legal in the [LOC U.S.  ] , but oppose making it more widely available . 
Internationally , the [LOC Vatican  ] would forcefully oppose USG advocacy of legalizing abortion elsewhere , financing foreign abortions , or making abortion an international “reproductive right.” The [LOC Vatican  ] would welcome an honest , respectful dialogue with the [LOC United States  ] on abortion . 
[LOC Vatican  ] officials followed your [MISC Notre Dame  ] speech closely . 
While clearly not agreeing with everything you said , they were very pleased by your calls to reduce the number of women seeking abortions , make adoption more available , and provide support for pregnant women . 
They appreciated your commitment to “honor the conscience of those who disagree with abortion , ” and especially welcomed the call for a sensible conscience clause for health care workers. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) The [LOC Vatican  ] opposes embryonic stem cell research on the grounds that it leads to the destruction of human embryos . 
It has no objection to non-embryonic stem cell research . 
As new techniques now allow research with adult stem cells , the [LOC Vatican  ] says the use of embryonic stem cells is not justified scientifically either . 
Financial Crisis , the [ORG Poor , and Immigration  ] ------------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) The [LOC Vatican  ] has been very vocal about protecting the world’s most vulnerable people from harm caused by the global financial crisis . 
In a letter to [LOC UK  ] PM [PER Gordon Brown  ] , for example , the [PER Pope  ] wrote , “Development aid , including the commercial and financial conditions favorable to less developed countries and the cancellation of the external debt of the poorest and most indebted countries , has not been the cause of the crisis and out of fundamental justice must not be its victim.” The [LOC Vatican  ] criticizes “consumerist” societies , strongly supports the [ORG UN Millennium Development Goals  ] , and hopes all countries will redouble efforts to meet their [ORG MDG  ] pledges . 
The [LOC Vatican  ] has long supported freer migration between nations to permit the poor to begin new lives . 
The [ORG USCCB  ] has made immigration reform a priority in the [LOC U.S.  ] , and the [PER Pope  ] will likely mention this in his discussions with you . 
The [PER Pope  ] is expected to issue the second “encyclical” ( letter addressed to the whole world about pressing moral issues ) of his papacy sometime during the week before your meeting . 
It will cover social justice concerns , and the [PER Pope  ] will likely mention it to you . 
( Embassy will forward a copy to the [LOC White House  ] as soon as it is available . 
) [ORG Food Security  ] ------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) Similarly , the [LOC Vatican  ] is very worried about declining nutrition in the poorest countries . 
The [LOC Vatican  ] has not taken a formal position on genetically modified ( [ORG GM  ] ) crops -- some Church leaders oppose them because [ORG GM  ] technology is mostly in the hands of multinational corporations , while others support their use as an element in a larger strategy to address world hunger . 
In his [ORG World Food Day  ] message in October 2008 , the [PER Pope  ] noted that the world can produce enough food to meet increasing needs , but said factors like speculation in foodstuffs , corrupt public officials , and growing investments in weapons prevented food from reaching the hungry . 
He called on world leaders to conclude negotiations to ensure food security , and to pursue relations “based on the reciprocal exchange of knowledge , values , rapid assistance and respect.” [ORG Environmental Issues VATICAN  ] 00000078 003.2 OF 005 -------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) The [PER Pope  ] speaks frequently about the importance of caring for [MISC God’s  ] creation . 
[LOC Vatican City  ] is the world’s first carbon-neutral state , offsetting its emissions through use of renewable energy and a reforestation project . 
It has not , however , taken a position on carbon emissions trade . 
The [LOC Vatican  ] is now using solar energy to power some facilities and is reducing its energy consumption overall , planning to be 20% energy self-sufficient by 2020 . 
The [LOC Holy See  ] is an active observer at the [ORG UN Environment Program  ] , [ORG Food and Agriculture Organization  ] and other international fora , and will participate in the December [ORG Copenhagen Conference  ] also as an observer . 
The [PER Pope  ] has even joined with other religious leaders like [ORG Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew  ] to issue moral appeals to their faithful on humanity’s responsibility to be good stewards of nature . 
The [MISC Vatican’s  ] environmental message is consistent: nature is a gift from [PER God  ] , so human beings have a responsibility to care for and not to abuse it . 
Arms Reduction -------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) The [LOC Vatican  ] welcomed your call to eliminate nuclear weapons , and has long advocated arms reductions and non-proliferation . 
The [LOC Holy See  ] was one of the initial signatories to the Convention on [MISC Cluster Munitions  ] in December 2008 - and ratified it the same day . 
( The [LOC Vatican  ] of course has no such weapons itself and becomes party to such agreements to serve as a moral example . 
) The [PER Pope  ] has advocated the elimination of land mines , and the [LOC Holy See  ] is a party to the [MISC Mine Ban Treaty  ] . 
Speaking at the [ORG UN  ] in May , the [LOC Vatican  ] envoy reaffirmed the [MISC Vatican’s  ] support for nuclear non-proliferation and outlined five steps for nations to take to eliminate the nuclear weapons threat: adherence to the [MISC Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty  ] , opening negotiations for a [ORG Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty  ] , ending reliance on nuclear arms as part of military policy among nuclear states , giving the [ORG International Atomic Energy Association  ] oversight over peaceful use of nuclear energy and expanding it role to include non-proliferation , and developing a new international agreement on nuclear fuel . 
[MISC Inter-faith  ] Understanding ------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) The [LOC Vatican  ] praised your [LOC Cairo  ] speech , especially the sections on religious freedom and diversity , the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] situation , and [LOC Iran  ] . 
The [LOC Vatican  ] itself has worked for decades on improving understanding with the [MISC Islamic  ] world , including through a pontifical institute for the study of [MISC Arabic  ] and [MISC Islam  ] . 
It stepped up inter-faith discussions after the September 11 attacks , and then again following the negative [MISC Muslim  ] reaction to a 2006 speech by the [PER Pope  ] that some argued demeaned [MISC Islam  ] . 
Key dialogues are with: the “group of 138” - moderate [MISC Muslim  ] scholars and clerics - supported by [LOC Jordan  ] ; [MISC Iranian  ] clerics ; [ORG Al-Azar University  ] in [LOC Cairo  ] , which co-hosted your speech ; and [MISC Saudi  ] authorities . 
The [MISC Vatican’s  ] primary objective for these talks is to promote religious freedom . 
The [LOC Holy See  ] does not believe theological agreements with [MISC Islam  ] are possible , but is convinced that better mutual knowledge will allay suspicions and facilitate peaceful co-existence , which they consider an even higher goal than simple “tolerance.” Another [LOC Vatican  ] goal is supporting pragmatic inter-faith cooperation on social welfare programs . 
The [LOC Vatican  ] believes governments should ensure religious freedom , but not be directly involved in interreligious dialogue ( which by its nature should be between religious leaders ) . 
[LOC Middle East Peace Process  ] ------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) Peace in the “Holy Land” is one of the [MISC Vatican’s  ] top priorities , and was one of the central themes of the [MISC Pope’s  ] May visit to [LOC Israel  ] , [LOC Jordan  ] and the [MISC Palestinian  ] territories . 
Despite criticism from some media and extremists , the trip was substantively successful . 
The [PER Pope  ] avoided any major mis-steps ( always a difficult prospect for a [LOC Pontiff  ] in visiting this area ) and delivered the message that a two-state solution is the key to peace . 
He emphasized that the use of violence to achieve political objectives is morally unacceptable . 
He called for [LOC VATICAN  ] 00000078 004.2 OF 005 inter-faith dialogue and protection of [MISC Christian  ] minorities . 
His messages largely mirror the [LOC U.S.  ] approach to the region . 
This provides opportunities for further engagement with the [LOC U.S.  ] in advancing peace initiatives there . 
[LOC Iraq  ] and [MISC Christians  ] ------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) The [LOC Holy See  ] publicly opposed [LOC U.S.  ] intervention in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Once fighting began , however , the [LOC Vatican  ] focus shifted to securing peace and justice , rebuilding the [MISC Iraqi  ] economy , and protecting minority [MISC Christian  ] communities . 
[LOC Holy See  ] officials welcome your proposals for responsible withdrawal of [LOC U.S.  ] troops , provided this does not create a security vacuum , particularly in [MISC Christian  ] areas . 
The [LOC Vatican  ] appreciates [LOC U.S.  ] resettlement of the most vulnerable [MISC Iraqi  ] victims of persecution -- including many [MISC Christians--  ] but seeks to avoid large-scale exodus of [MISC Christians  ] from that country . 
( Regional bishops estimate as many as half of the region’s 300-400,000 Chaldean [MISC Christians  ] have left , and believe they will not return . 
) The [LOC Vatican  ] was deeply concerned last fall that quotas set for [LOC Iraq’s  ] provincial elections system might reduce [MISC Christian  ] representation in local governments , fueling further emigration . 
It took the unusual step of formally asking the [ORG USG  ] to press the [MISC Iraqis  ] to increase the quotas for [MISC Christians  ] . 
Despite a boycott threat , [MISC Christians  ] ultimately participated in the provincial elections . 
The future of the [MISC Christian  ] communities in [LOC Iraq  ] will remain high on the [LOC Vatican  ] agenda before and after the [LOC U.S.  ] military drawdown . 
[LOC Africa  ] ------ <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) The [PER Pope  ] travelled to [LOC Africa  ] in March . 
He grabbed headlines with an interview he gave en route saying that the use of condoms contributed to the spread of [MISC AIDS  ] . 
The [LOC Vatican  ] later clarified the [MISC Pope’s  ] comments , saying that condoms are not always 100% effective and noting studies that show condom distribution increases promiscuity . 
[PER Benedict XVI  ] has called on world leaders to pay special attention to the needs of the Continent - where one in four people suffer from chronic hunger -- this year . 
In a letter to the [MISC German  ] President , [PER Pope Benedict  ] wrote that the “support of the international community is needed...precisely because the current financial and economic crisis is particularly affecting [MISC Africa.”  ] The [LOC Pontiff  ] has pledged the [ORG Church’s  ] continued assistance to the weakest sectors of Africa’s population . 
( The [ORG UN  ] estimates that [MISC Catholic  ] charities provide 17% of health care in sub-Saharan [LOC Africa  ] ; the Church also runs schools , homes for the aged , re-integration centers for child soldiers and other programs there . 
) Bishops from [LOC Africa  ] will gather in [LOC Rome  ] in October for a month to discuss needs on the continent . 
[LOC Cuba  ] ---- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) The Church is the only major institution in [LOC Cuba  ] that is independent from the government . 
The [LOC Vatican  ] hopes for a transition to democracy in [LOC Cuba  ] , but is not at the forefront of that battle because it is more concerned about protecting its small space for operations in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
The [LOC Vatican  ] opposes the [LOC U.S.  ] embargo , which it believes hurts poor [MISC Cubans  ] disproportionately . 
It welcomed your decision to remove limits on family visitation and remittances . 
[LOC Vatican  ] officials believe that exchanging the five [MISC Cuban  ] spies imprisoned in the [LOC U.S.  ] for political prisoners in [LOC Cuba  ] is worth discussing , and have urged the [LOC U.S.  ] to grant visas to the wives of the spies to allow them to visit . 
[LOC Turkey  ] [ORG EU  ] Accession ------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) As Cardinal [PER Ratzinger  ] , the [PER Pope  ] had expressed uneasiness about the notion [MISC Turkish  ] accession to the [ORG EU  ] . 
The [ORG Holy See’s  ] position now is that as a non-EU member the [LOC Vatican  ] has no role in promoting or vetoing Turkey’s membership . 
The [LOC Vatican  ] might prefer to see [LOC Turkey  ] develop a special relationship short of membership with the [ORG EU  ] , but [LOC Vatican  ] Secretary of State ( Prime Minister-equivalent ) [ORG Bertone  ] has stated that [LOC Turkey  ] should become a member if it meets all the [ORG EU  ] [LOC VATICAN  ] 00000078 005.2 OF 005 criteria - including full protection of human rights and religious freedoms . 
[LOC Iran  ] ---- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) The [LOC Holy See  ] is deeply concerned about the recent violence and ongoing human rights violations in [LOC Iran  ] . 
It has been publicly silent to date on the current crisis , in part to preserve its ability to act as an intermediary if an international crisis emerges . 
( The [LOC Vatican  ] helped secure the release of [MISC British  ] sailors detained in [MISC Iranian  ] waters in April 2007 . 
) It is unclear how much clout the [LOC Vatican  ] really has with [LOC Iran  ] , however .
