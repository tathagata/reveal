( C ) Ref B reports on [MISC Summit of the Americas  ] ( [ORG SOA  ] ) Coordinator Ambassador [PER Hector Morales  ] meetings with [MISC Brazilian  ] officials , notably the increased [MISC Brazilian  ] focus on the [ORG SOA  ] . 
According to [MISC Brazilian  ] Ministry for [ORG External Relations  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) Undersecretary [PER Vera Machado  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] views the [ORG SOA  ] as complementary to the [ORG Bahia Summit of Latin American and Caribbean  ] ( [ORG LAC  ] ) heads of state and government ( Ref C ) and an important means of communication for all [ORG Western Hemisphere  ] governments . 
[LOC Brazil  ] , like most other [ORG Summit  ] participants , has high expectations for the [ORG Obama Presidency  ] and looks to the President for a positive signal as to the importance of the [ORG Western Hemisphere  ] in [LOC U.S.  ] policy considerations . 
Speaking at a [LOC Wall Street  ] Journal-sponsored seminar in [LOC New York March  ] 17 , President [PER Lula  ] said the [ORG Summit  ] would be " an ideal scenario ( for the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) to reestablish a policy of democratic and peaceful coexistence with the region . 
" For the [ORG Summit  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] will focus on the economic crisis , food security and energy , looking to avoid linkages between the latter two of these issues . 
Although the GOB may agree to or actively devote resources to major new initiatives under the [ORG Summit  ] process , it will seek to create a positive tone for the [ORG SOA  ] , mediate differences among the participants , and use the [ORG SOA  ] to launch a productive dialogue between the [LOC United States  ] and [ORG LAC  ] . 
Answers to questions raised in ref a , are contained in paragraph 2 below. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S/NF ) A1 ) [ORG Brazilian Presidential Advisor  ] [PER Marcel Biato  ] told Ambassador [PER Morales  ] that [LOC Brazil  ] hoped the [LOC U.S.  ] would not enter the [ORG SOA  ] with a series of new initiatives to push on [MISC Latin American  ] governments and that the [LOC U.S.  ] would do better to listen to the concerns of its neighbors . 
In general , [LOC Brazil  ] downplays substantive results from presidential summits . 
The December [ORG Bahia Summit  ] , for example , was more notable as a demonstration of [LOC Brazil  ] 's ability to convene its neighbors than for any result ( ref C ) . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] Government considers it important to agree on a [ORG Summit Declaration  ] but may be less concerned about its specific content as long as consensus is achieved . 
Human prosperity , social inclusion , job creation , and addressing the global economic crisis have emerged as the broad themes for which [LOC Brazil  ] 's priorities more closely match those of the [LOC United States  ] . 
Should the [LOC United States  ] choose to pursue a regional energy initiative , [LOC Brazil  ] will likely be much more supportive of a proposal which offers each country the choice of opting in or out of each element of the program . 
There is significant opposition in [LOC Brazil  ] to the idea of a " one size fits all " agreement on energy , or in general . 
2 ) It is highly unlikely that [LOC Brazil  ] will use the [ORG SOA  ] criticize the [LOC U.S.  ] publicly , although the view that [LOC U.S.  ] policies are to blame for other nations' economic difficulties is a common one in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
President [PER Lula  ] wants a good relationship with President [PER Obama  ] and will seek to avoid controversy and encourage [LOC Brazil  ] 's neighbors to do likewise . 
There is potential for disagreement on [LOC Cuba  ] as the [MISC Brazilians  ] have become increasingly officious in their advice to us that a good relationship with the region depends on our unilateral concessions to an aggrieved [LOC Cuba  ] . 
President [PER Lula  ] has promised [PER Raul Castro  ] that he will do what he can to facilitate a better relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] , and he will need to be able to demonstrate credibly that he has acted on this promise . 
[LOC Brazil  ] will prefer that the [LOC Cuba  ] discussion avoid center stage and take place in private , but in this context will join , and may even lead , the bandwagon of governments trying to change [LOC U.S.  ] [LOC Cuba  ] policy . 
3 ) As noted in ref c , [LOC Brazil  ] was the force behind the [ORG Bahia Summit  ] and is looking for avenues to assert its leadership in the region , and especially in [LOC South America  ] . 
[LOC Brazil  ] posited the [ORG Bahia Summit  ] as the " first ever " meeting only of [MISC Latin American  ] and [LOC Caribbean  ] heads of state and government without " external " powers . 
Indeed , the [ORG Bahia Summit  ] appears to have successfully shifted the dynamic of the [ORG SOA  ] from that of a " regional " meeting to an " inter-regional " U.S.-Latin [LOC America  ] meeting , along the lines of the [ORG Ibero-American Summit  ] , the [ORG EU-Latin America Summit  ] , and the [ORG Arab States-South America Summit  ] . 
For [PER Lula  ] , the [ORG SOA  ] will provide an opportunity to carry the region 's messages to President [PER Obama  ] and demonstrate leadership . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG MRE  ] and [ORG Presidency  ] have assured us that [LOC Brazil  ] believes that the new regional summit fora should be complementary to the [ORG OAS  ] and [ORG SOA  ] , and [LOC Brazil  ] is unlikely to act in such a way as to undercut the [ORG SOA  ] . 
[ORG BRASILIA  ] 00000364 002 OF 002 4 ) As noted above , [LOC Brazil  ] is interested in a harmonious [ORG Summit  ] and would prefer to avoid controversy . 
It is likely that President [PER Lula  ] will attempt to moderate [PER Chavez  ] without coming out into blatant opposition to the [MISC Venezuelan  ] President . 
It is possible that , as a way of doing this , he will take a tougher rhetorical stance on some issues than he might in a bilateral setting . 
5 ) We have no evidence that [LOC Brazil  ] would favor any measure that would jeopardize the [ORG Inter-American Human Rights System  ] . 
B1 ) While we do not expect [LOC Brazil  ] to agree with the [LOC U.S.  ] on all issues , we believe the [LOC Brazil  ] government will take a constructive approach to the [ORG Summit  ] and seek consensus on a [ORG Summit Declaration  ] . 
Even where it agrees to broad language in the declaration in support of [ORG SOA  ] themes , [LOC Brazil  ] may resist concrete initiatives on topics that it perceives as potentially divisive in the region , such as democratic governance , energy , trade , and public security . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is unlikely to press issues that it knows will put the [LOC United States  ] on the defensive , and is likely to try to mediate any such disputes that arise . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Summit Coordinator Duarte  ] has told us that [LOC Brazil  ] has " high expectations for the [ORG Summit  ] " and would like to maintain " positive momentum " in [LOC U.S.  ] relations with the region .
