( [ORG SBU  ] ) Post passed ref A talking points on pledging additional funds to the [ORG NATO  ] Training Mission-Iraq to [MISC Icelandic  ] MFA officials May 24 and discussed them with Acting Political Director [PER Thordur Bjarni Gudjonsson  ] June 9 . 
[PER Gudjonsson  ] expressed surprise that [LOC Washington  ] would be demarching [LOC Reykjavik  ] again so soon after [LOC Iceland  ] 's latest EUR 150,000 pledge ( ref B ) . 
Poloff reiterated USG appreciation for [LOC Iceland  ] 's 2005 and 2006 contributions , stressing , however , that the need for enhanced [MISC NTM-I  ] funding is now acute . 
[PER Gudjonsson  ] stated that his government would consider an additional pledge " in due course " but that such largesse was " not on the agenda " at present. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In the same conversation , [PER Gudjonsson  ] expressed anxiety that no date has yet been set for the next round of bilateral talks on [LOC U.S.  ] defense of [LOC Iceland  ] following closure of [MISC Naval Air Station  ] Keflavik this autumn . 
He implied that future [MISC Icelandic  ] funding of [ORG NATO  ] missions is in part contingent on how much [LOC Reykjavik  ] finds it will need to budget for homeland defense after the [LOC U.S.  ] restructures its forces here. van [MISC Voorst</pre></code>  ]
