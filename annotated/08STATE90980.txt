[ORG Ref: Moscow  ] 2522 ( NOTAL ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) This is an action request for all posts , see end of para 2. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Reftel lays out [MISC Russian  ] efforts to misinterpret the August 12 [LOC Georgia  ] ceasefire agreement mediated by [MISC French  ] President [PER Sarkozy  ] . 
Among other things , [LOC Russia  ] is claiming that the ceasefire allows for creation of a ? buffer zone ? around [LOC South Ossetia  ] , gives [MISC Russian  ] forces unlimited rights to " implement additional security measures " in and outside of [LOC South Ossetia  ] , and allows [LOC Russia  ] to " blue helmet " an unlimited number of forces to implement these additional security measures . 
ACTION REQUEST: These [MISC Russian  ] assertions are blatantly false , and posts should strongly rebut them with host country officials and media , using the facts laid out in the following paragraphs . 
As the [MISC French  ] negotiated these documents and are in the lead in ensuring that they are being carried out , Posts should not take the initiative in deploying these points ( i.e. public releases , opeds , other press , diplomatic demarches ) , but rather draw on them immediately if/when issues related to [LOC Georgia  ] are raised by host governments , media , etc. , as well as in explaining our larger [LOC Georgia  ] policies . 
END ACTION REQUEST. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Posts should be careful not to openly characterize President Sarkozy’s or other [MISC French  ] positions , but rather provide factual information. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Sarkozy  ] made clear in his August 14 letter to [MISC Georgian  ] President [PER Saakashvili  ] and in supplementary paragraphs attached to that letter that " ? additional security measures " are limited to " patrols " ( not a ? buffer zone ? or even checkpoints ) by [MISC Russian  ] peacekeeping forces that were in [LOC South Ossetia  ] prior to the outbreak of hostilities on August 7 , and that these patrols are limited to an area " not further than a few kilometers " outside of [LOC South Ossetia  ] , excluding other parts of [LOC Georgia  ] , the city of [LOC Gori  ] and other significant urban zones , and must not impede freedom of movement on major highways and railways. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Russia  ] ? s actions and statements in recent days raises suspicions that it does not intend to respect these restrictions on its forces in [LOC Georgia  ] , and is in fact angling to retain a larger zone of control than held prior to the invasion . 
These actions include [MISC Russian  ] forces -- not peacekeepers from pre-August 7 -- digging into positions in and around [LOC Poti  ] ( 200 kilometers from [LOC South Ossetia  ] ) , north of [LOC Gori  ] and other locations outside the zone prescribed for patrols ; [MISC Russian  ] military checkpoints impeding movements at the port of [LOC Poti  ] , near the main [MISC East-West  ] highway , and near [LOC Gori  ] and other urban areas ; and continued [MISC Russian  ] destruction of civilian and military infrastructure. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) Posts are encouraged to review the following documents: the August 12 ceasefire agreement , the August 14 letter from [PER Sarkozy  ] to [PER Saakashvili  ] , and the supplemental paragraphs attached to the August 14 letter . 
All of these documents are now in the public domain . 
These documents are also available at www.intelink.sgov.gov/wiki/Portal:Crisis_Geor gia . <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) [PER Begin  ] text of August 12 ceasefire agreement: Agreed Protocol ( 1 ) No resort to force . 
( 2 ) A definitive halt to hostilities . 
( 3 ) Provision of free access for humanitarian assistance . 
( 4 ) [MISC Georgian  ] military forces must withdraw to the places they are usually stationed . 
( 5 ) [MISC Russian  ] forces must withdraw to their positions prior to the outbreak of hostilities . 
While awaiting an international mechanism , [MISC Russian  ] peacekeeping forces will implement additional security measures . 
( 6 ) Opening of international discussions on security and stability modalities in [LOC Abkhazia  ] and [LOC South Ossetia  ] .

( U ) [PER Begin  ] text of [PER Sarkozy  ] letter to [PER Saakashvili: Paris  ] , 14 August 2008 Mister President: Regarding point 5 of the six-point accord to which you ? after President [PER Medvedev  ] ? gave your approval 12 August during our meeting in [LOC Tbilisi  ] , and which states that " [MISC Russian  ] military forces should withdraw to positions prior to the outbreak of hostilities " ? and that " while waiting for an international mechanism , [MISC Russian  ] forces will implement additional security measures , " I wish to share with you the following points for the sake of precision: -- As I made clear at our joint press conference in [LOC Tbilisi  ] , these " additional security measures " may only be implemented in the immediate proximity of [LOC South Ossetia  ] to the exclusion of any other part of [MISC Georgian  ] territory . 
-- More precisely , these " measures " ? may only be implemented inside a zone of a depth of a few kilometers from the administrative limit between [LOC South Ossetia  ] and the rest of [LOC Georgia  ] in a manner such that no significant urban zone would be included ? 
I am thinking in particular of the city of [LOC Gori  ] . 
Special arrangements must be defined to guarantee the liberty of movement and traffic along the length of the major highways and railways of [LOC Georgia  ] . 
-- These " additional security measures " ? will take the form of patrols undertaken solely by [MISC Russian  ] peacekeeping forces at a level authorized by existing agreements , with other [MISC Russian  ] forces withdrawing to their positions prior to 7 August in conformity with the agreed protocol ; -- These " measures " will have a provisional character while awaiting the establishment as quickly as possible of the ? international mechanism ? whose nature and mandate are still the subject of discussion by different international entities , in particular the [ORG OSCE  ] , the [ORG European Union  ] , and the [ORG United Nations  ] . 
Armed with these points of precision , I ask that you confirm the agreement that you gave me and that you announced publicly in [LOC Tbilisi  ] while affixing your signature at the bottom of the six-point agreed protocol that I had myself signed as a witness and guarantor in the name of the [ORG European Union  ] . 
President [PER Medvedev  ] yesterday assured me that your signature would lead to the withdrawal of [MISC Russian  ] forces pursuant to the accord concluded . 
I ask that you accept , Mister President , the assurance of my highest consideration. s/s [PER Nicolas Sarkozy  ] End text. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) [PER Begin  ] text of supplementary paragraphs attached to August 14 [PER Sarkozy  ] letter to [PER Saakashvili:  ] -- In the letter accompanying the cease-fire document , the mentioned territory is defined as in the immediate proximity of the zone of conflict , as defined by previous agreements , to the exclusion of any other part of [MISC Georgian  ] territory . 
Any measure referred to in this document shall be implemented within an area not further than a few kilometers , around [LOC Tskhinvali  ] within the zone of conflict . 
-- In no way can these measures limit or jeopardize freedom of movement and traffic along the length of the major highways and railways of [LOC Georgia  ] . 
-- Other aspects of the conflict resolution process will be discussed in the near future .
