( [ORG SBU  ] ) USDP [PER Edelman  ] and [ORG Major General Allardice  ] met with [LOC UK  ] officials in [LOC London  ] October 15 on a broad range of issues including [LOC Pakistan  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , and [ORG Russia/Georgia  ] . 
At the [ORG MOD  ] , [PER Edelman  ] and [PER Allardice  ] met with the Chief of the [ORG Defense Staff  ] [PER Jock Stirrup  ] and Policy Director [PER John Day  ] ; at [ORG FCO  ] with Permanent Under Secretary for Security Affairs [PER Peter Ricketts  ] ; and at the [ORG Cabinet Office  ] with Foreign and Security Adviser to the Prime Minister [PER Simon McDonald  ] and the Cabinet’s Deputy Head of the Foreign and [ORG Defense Policy Secretariat  ] [PER Margaret Aldred  ] . 
[PER Bleak Situation  ] in [LOC Pakistan  ] -- But a Few Glimmers --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Although [LOC UK  ] interlocutors were generally pessimistic about [MISC Pakistan’s  ] prospects , including the government’s ability to manage the financial crisis , they expressed cautious optimism about President Zardari’s efforts to cooperate with [LOC Afghanistan  ] President [PER Karzai  ] . 
[PER McDonald  ] noted that Prime Minister Brown wants to “encourage communications” between [PER Zardari  ] and [PER Karzai  ] since he “believes that if the top levels can work well together , the lower levels” will follow suit . 
[PER Ricketts  ] , who had just returned from a visit to [LOC Pakistan  ] , praised Zardari’s efforts to reach out to [MISC Karzai.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Ricketts  ] characterized [PER Zardari  ] as having “not much sense of how to govern a country...I fear he talks and talks but not much happens.” [PER Ricketts  ] stated that HMG would “like to believe in [LOC Zardari...he  ] says the right things , but he faces big challenges , ” including the economy , which “is in a really bad way.” [PER Stirrup  ] stated that [LOC Pakistan  ] is “arguably worse” now than a month ago , asserting that although [PER Zardari  ] has “made helpful political noises , he’s clearly a numbskull.” Real progress in [LOC Pakistan  ] requires “a government with stability and self-confidence” with a goal beyond “hanging on to power.” [PER Stirrup  ] stated that a major obstacle to progress is an “enormous strand of deep anti-Americanism among the public” although such views have diminished considerably among the political classes . 
According to Day , Zardari’s principal strategy appears to be asking for “lots of development aid...and meanwhile circumstances on the ground are getting worse.” Day described [PER Zardari  ] as a “more positive and stable leader than we’d feared and his relations with [PER Karzai  ] are a plus , ” but [PER Zardari  ] “does not know what to do and is waiting for someone to provide him a solution.” [PER McDonald  ] also deprecated Zardari’s “passing the hat quite energetically” and stated that during a recent meeting with [MISC British  ] officials he presented a “specific shopping list.” Despite “encouraging first signs” when [PER Zardari  ] took office , it has become clear he is “not running the country.” <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER McDonald  ] acknowledged [LOC U.S.  ] concerns about former Premier [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] , including ties to [MISC Islamists  ] , but asserted that “he’s indicated he’s willing to change and some in the system believe he has already done that.” Although Sharif’s “moment may not come for a couple of years” he is in line to be [MISC Pakistan’s  ] next President , [PER McDonald  ] said . 
[PER Ricketts  ] observed , however , that many members of the opposition are “publicly irresponsible” although some , like [PER Sharif  ] , are “reasonable in private.” <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Stirrup  ] agreed that “clear intelligence” has demonstrated that [ORG U.S. Predator  ] drone strikes in [LOC Waziristan  ] have had an impact on terror networks . 
[PER Ricketts  ] noted that cross border operations are “resonating hard” in [MISC Pakistan’s  ] political world , but [PER Ricketts  ] and other interlocutors concurred that the [MISC Pakistani  ] leadership was not presently troubled by [MISC U.S. Predator  ] strikes that kill “Arabs” and [ORG Taliban  ] , although [PER Stirrup  ] cautioned that such attitudes could change. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Stirrup  ] asserted that General [PER Ahmed Pasha’s  ] recent appointment as head of the [ORG Inter-Services Intelligence  ] ( [ORG ISI  ] ) , the army spy agency , by [MISC Pakistani  ] Army Chief [PER Ashfaq Kayani  ] ( former [ORG ISI  ] head ) reflects Kayani’s efforts to “get control of the ISI” and make sure that [PER Zardari  ] won’t control the [ORG ISI  ] . 
[PER Stirrup  ] claimed that HMG has urged [PER Zardari  ] and civilian leadership to get control over [ORG ISI  ] but “when we put pressure on the [MISC Pakistanis  ] they rearrange the furniture.” [PER Ricketts’  ] described [PER Pasha  ] as “Kayani’s man , ” but also noted that during his recent trip to [LOC Pakistan  ] “everyone spoke highly” of [PER Pasha  ] . 
[MISC Afghanistan: Getting the Message Right  ] -------------------------------------- Q ( C/NF ) Several interlocutors expressed concern that rising casualties in [LOC Afghanistan  ] could result in waning public support in allied countries for the mission there . 
[PER McDonald  ] stated that in [LOC Great Britain  ] the “electorate wants some movement” in [LOC Afghanistan  ] ; public sentiment could turn against the “good war” as casualties mount , he asserted . 
Consequently , the public in allied countries requires “a realistic narrative” that explains the goals in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Stirrup  ] noted that JCS Chairman Mullen’s October 9 [ORG Congressional  ] testimony , in which he predicted that 2009 would present increased challenges in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and that “trends across the board are not going in the right direction , ” was “headline news” in the [LOC United Kingdom.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) “Security is our top concern , but we need political progress , ” in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Stirrup  ] emphasized . 
[PER Ricketts  ] asserted that “we’re holding our own” in the fight against the [ORG Taliban  ] and that a uniquely military solution is not sufficient , as we “need to find social and economic solutions.” Part of the problem , he continued , is that in [LOC Afghanistan  ] the “perception of security is diminishing” and “fear of [ORG Taliban  ] reprisals” impede progress . 
Consequently , efforts to build civil-military links are crucial to building stability , [PER Ricketts  ] stated. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Day stated that HMG continues to feel “deep frustration” with [PER Karzai  ] , wryly adding that “I remind people that we -- the international community -- selected him.” For all [MISC Karzai’s  ] faults , Day continued , the real question concerning [MISC Karzai’s  ] future is whether there is a “constitutional alternative.” One dire possible scenario would be “failed elections ( in 2009 ) with [PER Karzai  ] having reduced legitimacy and with violence attributed to the campaign.” [PER Stirrup  ] remarked on the importance of ensuring “respectable elections.” [PER McDonald  ] stated that building up the [ORG Afghan National Army  ] to the goal of a well-trained force of 122,000 soldiers plus 12,000 in training would take a long time . 
[PER Aldred  ] wondered whether one solution might be to follow [MISC Pakistan’s  ] model and “give the army some sort of economic benefit.” Some interlocutors shared their disappointment at the performance of [ORG UN  ] envoy [PER Kai Eide  ] . 
[PER Ricketts  ] qualified his critique of [PER Eide  ] with the observation that he had “weak back up” from the [ORG UN  ] system . 
Iran: Bigger Carrot , Bigger Stick ? ---------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) All [LOC UK  ] interlocutors agreed that fiscal pressure against [LOC Iran  ] has had an impact on the regime and that the international community needs to keep up the pressure , even if immediate changes are unlikely . 
[PER Ricketts  ] observed that “pressure on [MISC Iran’s  ] financial sector” coupled with falling oil prices have been effective and that the “squeeze” against [LOC Iran  ] should continue . 
According to [PER Ricketts  ] , “Supreme Leader ( [PER Ayatollah Khameini  ] ) feels that ( President ) [PER Ahmadinejad  ] has not delivered...and the bourgeoisie in [LOC Tehran  ] is openly dismissive of [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , ” also concluding that he has not delivered . 
Therefore , we must “plug along” with sanctions and “our advice is to increase the size of the carrot and the stick” in dealing with [LOC Iran  ] . 
He raised the possibility of the [LOC United States  ] opening a “visa section” in [LOC Tehran  ] , suggesting that “lines of people around the block” queuing for visas would send an “effective message” to [MISC Iran’s  ] leadership . 
[LOC Iraq  ] SOFA: [LOC UK  ] Looks to [LOC U.S.  ] for Help ------------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C/NF ) [PER McDonald  ] stressed that the [LOC UK  ] could not have an “orderly transition” of its forces in [LOC Iraq  ] without a [ORG SOFA  ] to provide a legal framework and the [LOC UK  ] seeks to “piggyback” on the [MISC U.S.-Iraq  ] [ORG SOFA  ] . 
Day noted that Prime Minister [PER Brown  ] seeks a “low key transition” of [MISC British  ] forces in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[PER Stirrup  ] emphasized that “from a military perspective a [LOC UK  ] soldier cannot show up in an [MISC Iraqi  ] court , ” expressing concern that he was “not sure the [ORG SOFA  ] will get through the [MISC Iraqi  ] system.” [PER USDP Edelman  ] provided an update on the progress of the [MISC U.S.-Iraq  ] [ORG SOFA  ] and reassured his interlocutors that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC UK  ] shared similar concerns on jurisdiction issues . 
Avoiding a “Wretched Row” over [ORG MAP  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C/NF ) [PER McDonald  ] stated that HMG rejects the view of “some partners who want to get back to business as usual with [MISC Russia.”  ] He continued that Prime Minister [PER Brown  ] shares President Bush’s emphasis on the “importance of allied unity on the [LOC Georgia  ] crisis.” Although the [LOC UK  ] supports MAPs for [LOC Georgia  ] and [LOC Ukraine  ] , [ORG HMG  ] does not believe the [ORG Alliance  ] will agree on MAPs at the December 2-3 [ORG NATO  ] Ministerial . 
Consequently , [ORG HMG  ] is “working up a [ORG Bucharest Implementation  ] Plan” that will contain the elements of a [ORG MAP  ] but would not be “as frightening a word as MAP” to some allies . 
[PER McDonald  ] stressed that such a plan would help cement [ORG Alliance  ] unity and he said he would raise it with [ORG NSA Hadley  ] during his meeting with him in [LOC Washington  ] in a few days . 
Day characterized the plan as “like [ORG MAP  ] , but without the name , ” also noting that “the risk of allied disunity is huge.” [PER Ricketts  ] affirmed HMG’s support for a [MISC Georgian  ] [ORG MAP  ] , but allies should seek a compromise in order to maintain unity and “avoid a wretched row.” [PER Aldred  ] observed that , depending on the result of Ukraine’s elections , [LOC Ukraine  ] may not have a government come the ministerial , temporarily mooting the question of a [ORG MAP  ] for [LOC Ukraine  ] . 
[LOC France:  ] [LOC EU Presidency  ] -- and [ORG NATO  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Ricketts  ] stated that HMG has been “pleasantly surprised” by the pragmatism of [LOC France’s EU Presidency  ] . 
Day remarked that the current [MISC French  ] plan to reintegrate into NATO’s military command is the third such effort. “I am not sure [LOC France  ] understands the implications of what they need to do to provide officers and staffers for [ORG NATO  ] integration.” The [ORG New DefMin...  ] ------------------ <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Stirrup  ] offered a preliminary assessment of new Defense Minister [PER John Hutton  ] , who replaced former [PER DefMin Des Browne  ] in the October 3 cabinet reshuffle . 
He stated that the reshuffle was unexpected at the [LOC MOD  ] and that Defense was the only portfolio [PER Hutton  ] would accept when [PER Peter Mandelson  ] replaced [PER Hutton  ] as Business Secretary . 
Citing “political considerations” that dominated the Cabinet reshuffle , [PER Stirrup  ] opined that it was “disappointing from our perspective that so little thought was given to what was best for ( the [ORG Ministry of ) Defense”  ] since “we did not need a change” at the [LOC MOD  ] . 
However , “we were lucky we got who we got , ” since [PER Hutton  ] is a military historian who is “keen on defense and keen on his job.” <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( U ) [PER USDP Edelman  ] cleared this message .
