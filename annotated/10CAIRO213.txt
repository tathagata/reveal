KEY POINTS -- ( C ) Human rights activist [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us February 10 he believes the top [ORG USG  ] human rights priority in [LOC Egypt  ] should be diplomatic approaches to urge the [ORG GOE  ] to combat torture . 
He recommended quiet diplomacy over public statements. -- ( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was pessimistic the [ORG GOE  ] would pass human rights-related legislation besides a trafficking law before the 2011 presidential election , but asserted that the [ORG GOE  ] could be open to issuing a discreet order to stop torture -- ( C ) He described police torture as pervasive , and attributed it to senior-level [ORG Interior Ministry  ] pressure on officers to extract confessions , especially in murder cases , by any means necessary. -- ( C ) He speculated that a change in [ORG Interior Ministry  ] policy could have a positive effect on the rule of law , relations between the police and the public , and the overall human rights situation. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Comment: XXXXXXXXXXX 's suggestions , which focus on trying to change the [ORG GOE  ] 's political will through diplomacy , differ from other activists' recommendations for legislative changes to broaden the definition of torture ( the law defines torture only in the context of extracting confessions ) and increase the penalties . 
In response to [ORG USG  ] approaches on specific torture cases , the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] has been defensive and has claimed that police brutality is highly unusual ( reftels ) . 
In the MOI 's authoritarian power structure , an order from senior officials regarding police brutality could have a significant impact .

( C ) On February 10 , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] urged the [LOC U.S.  ] to focus on quiet diplomatic approaches to the [ORG GOE  ] on combating torture as our top human rights priority . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believed such diplomacy would be more successful than efforts on other human rights issues . 
XXXXXXXXXXXXX advised that a series of discreet diplomatic approaches , as opposed to public statements , would be most effective in securing [ORG GOE  ] agreement to combat torture . 
He said he has been in contact with diplomats from [ORG EU  ] countries to encourage them to make similar approaches to the [LOC GOE.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) XXXXXXXXXXX was pessimistic that the [ORG GOE  ] would pass significant political legislation , other than the human trafficking law , before the 2011 presidential elections . 
[ORG GOE  ] discussions about lifting the [ORG State of Emergency  ] and passing a counterterrorism law " are just a distraction , " he maintained . 
XXXXXXXXXXX asserted that [ORG MFA  ] and [ORG NDP  ] officials , as well as some journalists in the pro-government press , are embarrassed over the extensive use of torture , and want to see improvements . 
He believed that a discreet order from the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] to stop torture would have a powerful effect , and would be more effective than the passage of legislation expanding the definition of torture and increasing penalties , which the quasi-government [ORG National Council for Human Rights  ] and independent [ORG NGOs  ] have urged . 
( Note: A contact confirmed that on February 15 a parliamentary committee rejected legislation proposed by a [ORG Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated MP  ] to increase prison terms for torture from the current 3-10 years to 25 years , and extend the definition to cover senior officers who order torture . 
End note .

( C ) According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , the worst police torture takes place during murder investigations . 
He said that his brother-in-law who is a police officer in the [MISC Delta Governorate of  ] [LOC Kafr El-Sheikh  ] described " unrelenting pressure " from superiors to solve murder [LOC CAIRO  ] 00000213 002 OF 002 cases by any means necessary . 
XXXXXXXXXXX said human rights lawyers and [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] have told him that to conduct murder investigations , police will round up 40 to 50 suspects from a neighborhood and hang them by their arms from the ceiling for weeks until someone confesses. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believed that a [ORG GOE  ] political decision to stop pressuring police officers to solve crimes quickly by using torture if necessary would have far-reaching effects . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] speculated that such a policy change could have a broad positive impact on the rule of law , the police 's role in society and even political participation . 
If the public 's fear of the police waned , he noted , citizens would not be as afraid to enter police stations to report crimes , tell the police about their neighborhoods , or procure voter registration cards for the coming elections . 
He said the current pervasive nature of torture began in the 1990 's when the security forces were fighting [MISC Islamic  ] extremists , and would be possible to reverse . 
XXXXXXXXXXX recalled that the public respected the police in the 1980 's , and he expected that with a policy change the [ORG GOE  ] could restore a positive relationship between the public and the police .
