( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] The [MISC Libyan  ] Government unexpectedly followed through February 13 with threats to suspend visa issuance to nationals of [LOC Schengen  ] member states ( ref ) , deporting dozens of [MISC European  ] nationals in the first 48 hours of the ban and creating chaos at [LOC Tripoli  ] 's airport . 
Local media reports that the retaliation came in response to the alleged publication of a list of 188 [MISC Libyan  ] officials and their families , including [MISC Libyan  ] leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] and son [PER Saif  ] al-Islam , who [LOC Switzerland  ] barred from [LOC Schengen  ] visa issuances . 
[ORG EU  ] diplomats report that they have been unable to verify that the list was in fact published . 
A close aide to [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi hinted that the [MISC Libyans  ] had instituted the ban on [ORG Schengen  ] travelers in frustration over the problems in the ongoing [MISC Swiss-Libyan  ] negotiations . 
[MISC European  ] diplomats have declared the situation a " political crisis , " and while some have publicly blamed the [MISC Swiss  ] for the current situation , others quietly assess the move as a vintage [MISC Libyan  ] attempt to up the ante in [MISC Swiss-Libyan  ] negotiations at a moment when the contretemps appeared to be near resolution . 
[ORG Schengen  ] members in [LOC Tripoli  ] are debating how to respond to the [MISC Libyan  ] move . 
End Summary . 
POLICY IMPLEMENTATION LEADS TO AIRPORT CHAOS 2 . 
( C ) Late on February 13 , the [MISC Libyan  ] Government announced that it was halting issuance of visas to nationals of [ORG Schengen  ] member countries , making good on its threats to retaliate for the [MISC Swiss  ] ban on [ORG Schengen  ] visa issuances for [MISC Libyan  ] officials and [PER Qadhafi  ] family members . 
( The [MISC Swiss  ] have been vetoing [ORG Schengen  ] visas for certain [MISC Libyans  ] since mid-2009 , as part of their effort to resolve the plight of the two [MISC Swiss  ] businessmen detained in [LOC Libya  ] since the summer of 2008 . 
) The [MISC Libyans  ] began segregating [MISC Europeans  ] from other arriving passengers late on February 14 , holding them in the airport for several hours before ultimately deporting tens of [MISC European  ] nationals , including several with valid residency permits . 
Although consuls were assured that [MISC European  ] nationals with valid [MISC Libyan  ] visas would still be granted entry into [LOC Libya  ] , on February 14 , [MISC European  ] nationals on flights arriving in [LOC Libya  ] from [LOC Rome  ] , [LOC Valletta  ] , and [LOC Vienna  ] encountered serious difficulties at the airport . 
The [ORG Consul  ] spoke with some [MISC Maltese  ] who had arrived in [LOC Libya  ] on an Air [LOC Malta  ] flight on February 14 ; they had been detained at the airport for five hours , without food or water , before finally being allowed entry . 
The [ORG Consul  ] also observed a [MISC European  ] diplomat having difficulty entering the country , despite his valid diplomatic visa . 
The [MISC Italian  ] [ORG Consul  ] , who was at the airport 's main arrival hall , was not permitted by the [MISC Libyan  ] authorities to enter the rest of the facility to confer with the detained [MISC Italians  ] . 
The [MISC Maltese  ] Ambassador was also prohibited from entering the airport . 
Several flights from [LOC Europe  ] and elsewhere arrived throughout the day on February 15 , and [MISC European  ] diplomatic contacts reported that passengers were stacking up at the airport as the [MISC Libyan  ] authorities decided whether to admit them . 
3 . 
( C ) On February 16 , the situation seemed to have improved somewhat , with only 20 [ORG Schengen  ] nationals deported . 
An [ORG EU  ] diplomat attributed the improvement to several factors . 
First , [ORG Lufthansa  ] and [MISC Austrian  ] Air had stopped boarding nationals from [ORG Schengen  ] member states , vastly decreasing the number of arrivals in [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
Second , the [MISC Italians  ] and other [ORG EU  ] members had issued consular travel notices warning citizens of the strong possibility of deportation upon arrival , which led to a decrease in the number of arrival and , the diplomat speculated , also led the [MISC Libyans  ] to ease up on the deportations . 
The diplomat also reported that the February 16 deportations seemed to focus on arriving general managers of foreign companies , rather than short-term visitors . 
SAIF'S NEWSPAPER ANNOUNCES THE BAN , [ORG GOL  ] JUSTIFIES IT 4 . 
( C ) The controversial [MISC Libyan  ] decision was first announced by the quasi-independent [ORG Oea  ] online newspaper ( part of [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi 's [ORG Al Ghad  ] media group ) on February 14 , in a report that quoted an anonymous [MISC Libyan  ] official announcing that " [LOC Libya  ] has decided to suspend granting visas to all [ORG EU  ] nationals . 
" The newspaper asserted that the decision came " following [LOC Switzerland  ] 's decision to ban 188 [MISC Libyan  ] figures from entering its territories . 
The [MISC Swiss  ] ban includes the [MISC Libyan  ] leader [ [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] ] and his family , including [PER Saif  ] al-Islam . 
" 5 . 
( C ) In a February 15 conversation with Pol/Econ Chief , a [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000134 002.2 OF 003 close aide and advisor to [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi asserted that " the [MISC Europeans  ] should not have been surprised " by the measure , as the issue of retaliation against all [ORG Schengen  ] states for [LOC Switzerland  ] 's veto decision had been " raised with them lots of times , and as early as a month ago . 
" Since " none of the [ORG EU  ] nations were choosing to pressure the [MISC Swiss  ] , " the [ORG GOL  ] decided to take action . 
[PER Saif  ] 's staff asserted that the visa issue had reached a breaking point , " especially for [PER Saif  ] , " who had been included on [LOC Switzerland  ] 's [ORG Schengen  ] visa veto list despite his work to facilitate political reconciliation between the [MISC Swiss  ] and [MISC Libyans  ] . 
The aide asserted that [PER Saif  ] 's inclusion on the list was " humiliating to him . 
" He blamed the [MISC Swiss  ] for stalling progress in the [MISC German-mediated  ] political talks , claiming that the [MISC Swiss  ] had backed off from a previous agreement to investigate the 2008 arrest in [LOC Switzerland  ] of [LOC Hannibal  ] al-Qadhafi as part of the normalization package . 
According to the [MISC Russian  ] ambassador , [PER Saif  ] was in [LOC Moscow  ] on February 15 following a hunting trip in southern [LOC Russia  ] . 
6 . 
( C ) Foreign Minister-equivalent [PER Musa Kusa  ] met [ORG Schengen  ] Ambassadors late in the day on February 15 to confirm that no further [MISC Libyan  ] visas would be issued to [ORG Schengen  ] nationals and that even those with valid visas would not be allowed entry , with no exceptions . 
When pressed by the ambassadors , [PER Kusa  ] agreed that diplomats from [ORG Schengen  ] member nations would be permitted entry and , possibly , [ORG Schengen  ] nationals with valid residency permits . 
However , he said that he would need to investigate further the residency issue . 
7 . 
( C ) [PER Kusa  ] said that the [MISC Libyan  ] Government had implemented the policy after the [MISC Swiss  ] had published the list of 188 [MISC Libyan  ] citizens on the [MISC Swiss  ] [ORG Schengen  ] veto list . 
Waving a document that he claimed was the published list , [PER Kusa  ] said that [MISC Libyan  ] leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] viewed the list as a personal insult that [LOC Libya  ] could not endure . 
Although the [ORG GOL  ] recognized that the decision to halt visas for [ORG Schengen  ] nationals could cause economic loss and complications , [LOC Libya  ] would stick to its policy . 
[PER Kusa  ] said that [LOC Libya  ] had been isolated for years and could manage without [LOC Europe  ] . 
" And if we need help , we can turn to the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC Japan  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , or [LOC Syria  ] , " he reportedly told the ambassadors . 
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE BACK STORY 8 . 
( C ) An [MISC Italian  ] diplomat who briefed us on the [PER Kusa  ] meeting said that no one had been able to verify whether the [MISC Swiss  ] veto list had in fact been published , and the [MISC Swiss  ] have denied doing so . 
A [MISC French  ] diplomat told us that the decision had come after a February 11 meeting chaired by PM-equivalent al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi , the same day the [ORG GOL  ] returned the passport of [MISC Swiss  ] businessman [PER Rachid Hamdani  ] . 
The [MISC French  ] diplomat believed that al-Mahmoudi chose to refer the decision to allow [PER Hamdani  ] to depart [LOC Libya  ] to [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi himself , and that the [MISC Libyan  ] leader 's response was to invoke the retaliatory ban on [MISC European  ] nationals . 
The [MISC French  ] diplomat suspected that the move was designed to up the ante in [MISC Swiss-Libyan  ] negotiations at a moment when the contretemps appeared to be near resolution 9 . 
( C ) [MISC Swiss  ] Charge [PER Stefano Lazarotto  ] said February 15 that based on readouts that he had received from [LOC Bern  ] , the most recent , third round of [MISC German-mediated  ] political talks had been positive , contrary to the report given by [PER Saif  ] al-Islam 's aide . 
[PER Lazarotto  ] believes that the [ORG GOL  ] was well aware that the [MISC Swiss  ] were ready to end the [ORG Schengen  ] visa freeze and to begin issuing visas immediately after the two [MISC Swiss  ] businessmen had been allowed to leave [LOC Libya  ] . 
He defensively said that the idea of an arbitration council had been off the table since the September 18 , 2009 , " kidnapping " of the two [MISC Swiss  ] businessmen by [MISC Libyan  ] officials . 
After their release , [MISC Swiss  ] negotiators agreed to establish an arbitration tribunal to investigate the [LOC Hannibal  ] case only if the [MISC Libyans  ] agreed to set up a similar tribunal to investigate the circumstances involved in the " kidnapping " of [PER Rachid Hamdani  ] and [PER Max Goeldi  ] ; a stipulation the [MISC Libyans  ] refused . 
10 . 
( C ) Until February 13 , [PER Lazarotto  ] was positive that [PER Hamdani  ] was on track to receive an exit visa and permission to depart the country -- he had already been cleared of all charges and received his passport back from the [ORG GOL  ] on Thursday evening , February 11 . 
Also on February 11 , the immigration court commuted [PER Max Goeldi  ] 's sentence to four , from sixteen , months , and he had agreed to pay the fine sentenced to him by the tax court . 
[PER Goeldi  ] 's lawyer was in the process of requesting a [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000134 003.2 OF 003 suspension of the prison sentence , pending [MISC Libyan-Swiss  ] political reconciliation . 
However , the " visa war " against [ORG Schengen  ] states that [LOC Libya  ] had declared moved the goal posts once again , and according to [PER Lazarotto  ] , was a typical pressure tactic that [LOC Libya  ] was using to obtain something more from [LOC Switzerland  ] , although he did not venture to guess what that might be . 
He did not know how [LOC Bern  ] would respond to the latest [MISC Libyan  ] pressure , but he dejectedly assessed that the only solution left was " to cut diplomatic relations , for the benefit of all . 
" He believed that [LOC Bern  ] was also coming to that conclusion . 
11 . 
( C ) The [MISC Libyan  ] Government 's move unleashed a barrage of attacks and infighting within the [ORG Schengen  ] community . 
The [MISC Austrian  ] Ambassador told the [MISC Swiss  ] Charge that the visa halt had become a " political crisis . 
" In an interview with [MISC Italian  ] media on February 16 , the [MISC Italian  ] Foreign Minister blamed the [MISC Swiss  ] for the current situation , saying that [LOC Switzerland  ] 's unilateral ban on visas to [MISC Libyan  ] officials had effectively held " other countries in the [ORG Schengen  ] area hostage . 
" The Ambassador witnessed a spirited debate at a reception on the evening of February 15 , with the [MISC Dutch  ] ambassador arguing that according to the [LOC Schengen Treaty  ] , other countries were entitled to unilaterally act in defiance of the [MISC Swiss  ] " hold . 
" Other [MISC Europeans  ] believed that was not the case but asserted that [LOC Switzerland  ] could choose to release other states of their obligations to prevent issuance of Shengen visas . 
Interestingly , several of the ambassadors believed they heard [PER Musa Kusa  ] say that that was not a solution ; [LOC Libya  ] , he reportedly said , would accept no [ORG Schengen  ] solution that did not include [LOC Switzerland  ] 's returning to the status quo ante with regard to complete [ORG Schengen  ] issuances by all countries in the treaty . 
A [ORG Schengen Committee  ] meeting is scheduled for February 18 in [LOC Brussels  ] , and [ORG EU  ] foreign ministers are expected to meet on February 22 , to discuss the [ORG EU  ] response to the [MISC Libyan  ] action . 
COMMENT 12 . 
( C ) [LOC Libya  ] 's escalation of its bilateral dispute with [LOC Switzerland  ] came at an unexpected time . 
The [MISC Swiss  ] and [MISC Libyans  ] had been moving forward with the political reconciliation process and were near resolution , indicating that the [MISC Libyan  ] leader , or his son [PER Saif  ] al-Islam , may want something more than the [MISC Swiss  ] are willing to give . 
While [LOC Libya  ] 's pressure on [MISC European  ] nations seems to be achieving its goal of dividing the [MISC European  ] block through isolation of [LOC Switzerland  ] , the full ramifications of the [MISC Libyan  ] visa ban remain to be seen in the [ORG EU  ] 's response to the [MISC Libyans  ] . 
The situation , if it is not resolved quickly , could evolve into a high-profile crisis over the coming days , with major implications for the ability of foreign companies to operate in [LOC Libya  ] , as well as for [MISC EU-Libyan  ] relations .
