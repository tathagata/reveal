( C ) SUMMARY . 
A [ORG Shell  ] official confirmed the company does not expect to make any final investment decisions before mid-2008 or early 2009 on the [ORG Persian LNG  ] and [ORG Yadavaran  ] gas and oil investment projects in [LOC Iran  ] . 
[MISC Dutch  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] officials noted surprise with the [MISC Iranian  ] announcement of a faster timetable for a deal with the [MISC Chinese  ] oil firm [ORG Sinopec  ] on [ORG Yadavaran  ] . 
These officials reiterated that [ORG Shell  ] regularly briefs them on its activities in [LOC Iran  ] . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Econoff discussed on April 17 reftel points regarding [ORG USG  ] concerns and opposition to oil and gas investments in [LOC Iran  ] with [ORG Dutch Ministry  ] of [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] ( [ORG MFA  ] ) officials [PER Daphne Bergsma  ] , Acting Head of the [ORG Gulf States Division  ] in the [LOC North Africa  ] and [LOC Middle East Department  ] , and [ORG Loek  ] ten [LOC Hagen  ] , [ORG Senior Policy  ] Officer and Desk Officer for [LOC Iran  ] in the same department . 
On May 3 , Econoffs also raised reftel points with [PER John Crocker  ] , Head of [ORG Royal Dutch Shell  ] 's [ORG International Government Relations and Senior Advisor  ] for [LOC North Africa  ] , [LOC Middle East  ] , [LOC Central Asia  ] , [LOC Ukraine  ] , and [LOC Russia  ] , and [PER Lynn Azar  ] , [ORG Shell  ] 's [ORG Regional Advisor  ] for the [LOC Middle East  ] and [LOC North Africa.  ] --------------------------------------- [ORG MFA  ] Surprised By [MISC Iranian  ] Announcement --------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Bergsma  ] said recent press statements from [MISC Iranian  ] Oil Minister [PER Vaziri Hamaneh  ] on an impending final investment deal with [MISC Chinese  ] oil firm [ORG Sinopec  ] on developing the [ORG Yadavaran  ] field had taken the [ORG GONL  ] by surprise . 
Recent information from officials from [ORG Shell  ] , which has an interest in developing [ORG Yadavaran  ] with [ORG Sinopec  ] , had indicated a final decision would not occur until 2008 or later , she added . 
Officially , she said , the [ORG GONL  ] did not interfere in [ORG Shell  ] 's decision-making process . 
Nonetheless , [ORG Shell  ] officials had assured the [ORG MFA  ] that the company would consider all factors -- including political -- prior to any final investment decision . 
Ten [LOC Hagen  ] confirmed the [ORG MFA  ] was in regular contact with [PER Crocker  ] on [ORG Shells' Iran  ] activities. --------------------- [ORG Shell  ] 's [ORG Iran Strategy  ] --------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) With expected declines in [MISC European  ] gas and oil production , decreased reliability of [MISC Russian  ] supplies , few viable alternatives , increasing reliance on natural gas , and long development cycles for energy projects ( up to ten years ) , [PER Crocker  ] said [ORG Shell  ] had concluded that stable future energy prices were dependent on outside investment in [LOC Iran  ] and the pursuit of big projects . 
While [ORG Shell  ] had no plans at present to increase its involvement beyond the [ORG Persian LNG  ] ( [LOC South Pars  ] ) , [ORG Yadavaran  ] , and other projects aimed at helping [LOC Gulf  ] countries overcome supply challenges , [PER Crocker  ] said the company still needed to think strategically now in preparation for any future investments . 
He said a May 1998 decision by the [ORG USG  ] to waive [MISC Iran-Libya Sanction Act  ] ( [ORG ILSA  ] ) sanctions for [LOC France  ] 's Total , [LOC Russia  ] 's [ORG Gazprom  ] , and [LOC Malaysia  ] 's [ORG Petronas  ] had led [ORG Shell  ] to believe future [LOC Iran  ] energy projects would also receive similar waivers. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Crocker  ] reiterated that [ORG Shell  ] was fully aware of [ORG USG  ] concerns about investments in [LOC Iran  ] 's oil and gas sector and the potential harm caused by public announcements at this sensitive time . 
He emphasized the importance of delivering similar messages to the [MISC Chinese  ] regarding [ORG Sinopec  ] . 
He said THE HAGUE 00000935 002 OF 002 [ORG Shell  ] was also following closely all pending [ORG Congressional  ] legislation that might tighten [LOC Iran  ] Sanction Act ( [PER ISA  ] ) implementation. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Crocker  ] stressed that [ORG Shell  ] regularly briefs relevant governments and the [ORG EU  ] , including Commission President [PER Jose Barroso  ] . 
According to [PER Crocker  ] , [PER Barroso  ] and other [ORG EU  ] governments were less concerned about [ORG Shell  ] 's exploratory activities in [LOC Iran  ] . 
There was a need to balance political concerns with the freedom of business to operate , he added. --------------------------------------------- - [ORG Persian LNG: No Final Decision  ] Before Mid-2008 --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Under the initial September 2004 framework agreement between [ORG Shell  ] and [LOC Iran  ] , a final [ORG Persian LNG  ] investment decision was expected by 2006 , [PER Crocker  ] explained . 
He said [ORG Shell  ] now anticipated that a final decision was not likely before mid-2008 , although the [MISC Iranians  ] still hoped for a decision by the end of 2007 . 
Some elements of the agreement continued to move forward , [PER Crocker  ] acknowledged , as the parties tried to develop a shared timeline. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Any final [ORG Shell  ] investment decision would be based on such economic factors as the projected market , customers , financial aspects , and potential risks , [PER Crocker  ] said . 
Given changes in these factors since 2004 , he indicated that the chances of concluding an investment decision based on the 2004 framework agreement were slim . 
Moreover , the 2004 agreement was negotiated at lower energy price levels , which [PER Crocker  ] suggested even [LOC Iran  ] would have problems accepting at this stage . 
A renegotiation of the framework agreement would add another six months to any projected timetable , he added. ---------------------------------------- [ORG Yadavaran: Final Decision In Early  ] 2009 ? ---------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Crocker  ] said it was hard to predict whether [ORG Shell  ] would succeed in securing favorable terms from [LOC Iran  ] for investing in [ORG Yadavaran  ] . 
[ORG Shell  ] had not yet agreed on a [ORG Yadavaran  ] strategy , he added . 
If [ORG Shell  ] did move forward on the project , he indicated that a framework agreement might be possible in late 2007 , followed by a final investment decision in early 2009 . 
He said he had noticed more urgency recently on the part of [LOC Iran  ] in determining whether to pursue development of [ORG Yadavaran  ] alone . 
[LOC Iran  ] was also considering an option for 100 percent foreign ownership during development with a full transition back to the [MISC Iranian  ] state following implementation , he noted. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Crocker  ] argued that [LOC Iran  ] would develop [ORG Yadavaran  ] with or without foreign involvement in order to maintain current oil production levels . 
With a six-year implementation and investment pay-back cycle , however , he said [LOC Iran  ] would only begin to receive revenues from the project starting in 2015 . 
Current investments thus would serve the [MISC Iranian  ] people and the world of tomorrow , and not the [LOC Iran  ] of today , he stressed . 
[MISC Western  ] expertise could also serve to increase the extraction rate for [ORG Yadavaran  ] by 40 or 50 percent over ten years , rather than only 20 percent if [LOC Iran  ] pursued [ORG Yadavaran  ] alone , he added .
