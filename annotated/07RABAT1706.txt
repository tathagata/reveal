[LOC MADRID  ] 02070 Classified By: Classified by Charge d'Affairs [PER Robert P. Jackson  ] for rea sons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) ------- Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) On November 6 [LOC Morocco  ] 's King [PER Mohammed VI  ] criticized [LOC Spain  ] over the visit of King [PER Juan Carlos  ] to the disputed enclaves of [LOC Ceuta  ] and [LOC Melilla  ] , but called for " honest and forward-looking dialogue " , sending a clear message that the relationship will be preserved . 
[MISC Moroccans  ] across the political spectrum have reacted stridently to the November 5 and 6 visits to the coastal cities . 
Prime Minister [PER Abbas El-Fassi  ] made a strong speech to Parliament and there were protests and sit-ins by senior government officials , [ORG NGOs  ] , and parliamentarians . 
[LOC Morocco  ] postponed the annual bilateral PM-chaired coordination meeting indefinitely . 
[ORG Foreign Affairs Committee Chair  ] [PER Fouad Ali El Himma  ] presented a protest letter to the [MISC Spanish  ] Ambassador on October 6 . 
This nationalist grandstanding increased the profile of both PM [PER El Fassi  ] and [PER El Himma  ] in the royal domain of [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] . 
Exacerbated by inopportune timing on the eve of [LOC Morocco  ] 's [LOC Green March  ] celebration , the visit raised political tensions , but has not so far appeared to have fired the public imagination . 
It is likely the flurry of [MISC Moroccan  ] anger will not set back burgeoning relations across the straits of [LOC Gibraltar  ] . 
End Summary. ----------------------------- Irked , but Calming the Waters ----------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Press reports indicate that on November 6 , royal adviser [PER Mohammed Moatassim  ] read a statement from King [PER Mohammed VI  ] to the [MISC Moroccan  ] cabinet . 
In it , the monarch condemned the recent visit by [LOC Spain  ] 's King [PER Juan Carlos  ] to the disputed [MISC Spanish  ] enclaves of [LOC Ceuta  ] and [LOC Melilla  ] on [LOC Morocco  ] 's northern coast as " useless " and a sign of " yearning for a long-gone era of darkness . 
" ( [ORG Note: Morocco  ] does not recognize [MISC Spanish  ] sovereignty over the two enclaves . 
End Note . 
) He reiterated his resolve to reassert [MISC Moroccan  ] sovereignty over the territories , which have been under [MISC Spanish  ] rule for approximately 500 years . 
He closed , however , by calling for an " honest and forward-looking " dialogue in order to continue building constructive relations between the two countries. ------------------------------------ Fired by Memories of the [LOC Green March  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) On November 5 , the day of the visit , a group of parliamentarians , [ORG NGO  ] representatives , local government officials and hundreds of protesters marched on the border crossing between [LOC Morocco  ] and the [MISC Spanish  ] enclave of [LOC Melilla  ] An even larger crowd ( some press estimates put the number of people at 5,000 ) demonstrated uneventfully at the border with [LOC Ceuta  ] . 
The march was organized to protest both [PER Juan Carlos  ] 's visit and the continued " colonization " of [MISC Moroccan  ] territory by [LOC Spain  ] . 
This event followed similar , but relatively small , peaceful protests outside the [MISC Spanish  ] Consulates in [LOC Tetouan  ] , [LOC Agadir  ] and [LOC Casablanca.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) In [LOC Rabat  ] , also on November 5 , a 10-person delegation headed by the Chairs of the parliamentary [ORG Foreign Affairs Committees  ] ( [ORG FAC  ] ) from the chambers of Councilors ( upper house ) and Deputies ( lower house ) , under the leadership of [ORG Deputies' FAC Chair  ] [PER Fouad Ali El Himma  ] , " demarched " the [MISC Spanish  ] Ambassador in his own [MISC Embassy.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) A [MISC Spanish  ] poloff told us that [PER Al Himma  ] personally transmitted a parliamentary letter of protest to the Ambassador during a surprisingly cordial meeting . 
He was accompanied by the heads of the major parliamentary caucuses , including the [ORG Party of Justice and Development  ] ( [ORG PJD  ] ) . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] Embassy told us that the letter repeated political leaders' call for [LOC Spain  ] to re-evaluate the status of the enclaves and criticized the King 's visit as provocative and [PER RABAT  ] 00001706 002 OF 002 inopportune. ---------------------------------- A Calculated [MISC Spanish  ] Miscalculation ? ---------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Other [MISC Spanish  ] emboffs told us that the Government of [LOC Spain  ] ( [ORG GOS  ] ) knew that King [PER Juan Carlos  ] 's visit would lead to a strong [MISC Moroccan  ] reaction , but that [MISC Spanish  ] electoral imperatives played a role in the decision to send him to the enclaves . 
The King had been under pressure from separatists on the one hand and grumbling from the military on the other . 
At the same time , Prime Minister [PER Zapatero  ] , who faces re-election in March 2009 , calculated that the domestic electoral boost he would receive from the king 's journey outweighed the damage it would do to bilateral relations . 
Additionally , [LOC Madrid  ] believed that [MISC Spanish/Moroccan  ] relations were the strongest they had ever been and that they would weather the storm . 
They maintained the visit by Crown [PER Prince Felipe  ] and Foreign Minister [PER Moratinos  ] on October 30 was actually an opportunity for [PER Moratinos  ] to give the [PER Fassi  ] government advance notice and sound out their reaction . 
At the time , [MISC Moroccan  ] Foreign Minister [PER Fassi-Fihri  ] assured the [MISC Spanish  ] of overall " business as usual . 
" Nevertheless the strength of the response caught the [MISC Spanish  ] diplomats here off guard . 
In one initial first consequence , the [MISC Moroccan  ] [ORG MFA  ] announced that the annual high-level coordination meeting , chaired by the two countries' respective Prime Ministers , was " unlikely to occur . 
" ---------------------- Remember the [LOC Melilla  ] ---------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Our [MISC Spanish  ] contacts felt that the widespread " manufactured outrage " and " orchestrated " demonstrations outside [MISC Spanish  ] missions and the two enclaves were a sign of the [PER Fassi  ] government 's weakness . 
The limping parliament seized on this issue to whip up the winds of [MISC Moroccan  ] nationalism and gain legitimacy in the eyes of a jaundiced electorate . 
They said that complaints by the unpopular Prime Minister [PER El Fassi  ] , that the visits " hurt [MISC Moroccans  ] feelings , " were an effort to distract from his own short-comings. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The strident and visible public reaction was likely exacerbated because the [PER Juan Carlos  ] visit came on the eve of annual celebrations commemorating the [LOC Green March  ] , the date on which [PER Hassan II  ] sent 20,000 [MISC Moroccans  ] into the desert to " liberate " the [LOC Western Sahara  ] from [LOC Spain  ] . 
In [LOC Morocco  ] at least , we note that stirring up nationalistic feelings to distract from domestic concerns has long been a tactic of the kingdom 's leaders . 
It was used by both Prime Minister [PER El Fassi  ] and [PER Fouad Ali El Himma  ] to strengthen their nationalist and foreign policy credentials . 
Neither the Prime Minister nor parliament have had much prior role in foreign affairs , a preserve of the throne. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The theatrics of the [MISC Moroccan  ] response could end up benefiting [PER Juan Carlos  ] and [PER Zapatero  ] as they face the [MISC Spanish  ] right . 
We assess that [PER Mohammed VI  ] 's comments are a signal to the [MISC Moroccan  ] side to reduce the rhetoric and histrionics and begin moving past the issue . 
We concur with our [MISC Spanish  ] colleagues that there likely will be little long-term effect on relations .
