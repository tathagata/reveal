( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: Deputy Special Envoy for [ORG Climate Change Jonathan  ] [PER Pershing  ] met with [ORG EU Climate Action  ] Commissioner [PER Connie Hedegaard  ] on February 11 . 
Also present was Ambassador [PER William Kennard  ] . 
[PER Pershing  ] and [PER Hedegaard  ] agreed that the U.S- [ORG EU  ] cooperation remains important , particularly in light of the statement issued by the BASICs following their January 25 meeting . 
They agreed on the need to operationalize the [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] and ensure it is incorporated into the [ORG UNFCCC  ] process . 
[PER Pershing  ] said it would be important to convene the ministers prior to the May meetings in [LOC Bonn  ] and suggested a meeting of the [ORG MEF  ] , to include relevant non-members . 
[PER Hedegaard  ] questioned whether guaranteed loans should be included in the $30 billion [ORG Fast Start  ] financing package , and [PER Pershing  ] suggested a meeting among the key donor states be held in the near term to discuss , and if possible , agree on a common approach to what financing would be listed in each country’s contribution . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Pershing  ] told [PER Hedegaard  ] that the prospects for climate and energy legislation this year increased following the [ORG State of the Union  ] address . 
He said the President is very focused on this issue and committed to a legislative package - not just an energy bill . 
[PER Hedegaard  ] said that she would be traveling to [LOC Washington  ] in mid-March as part of an [ORG EU  ] delegation and asked if it would be useful for the delegation to meet with [MISC Senators  ] . 
Ambassador [PER Kennard  ] cautioned the Commissioner , noting that any messages to the Hill must be constructive. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Pershing  ] said the focus for the [LOC U.S.  ] team in January had been to encourage as many countries as possible to associate with the [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] . 
He expects the final number to be about 120 countries , which is in the range of the 100-150 that the [ORG USG  ] had hoped for , although still less than would be desirable . 
He said that submissions by some major economies were “opaque” ; [PER Hedegaard  ] said [ORG China’s  ] submission was open to interpretation . 
[PER Pershing  ] said [ORG Brazil’s  ] and India’s submissions were as well and were probably the result of their January 25 agreement . 
Citing Special Envoy for [ORG Climate Change Todd  ] Stern’s February 9 speech , [PER Pershing  ] stressed two points: ( 1 ) the heads of states made commitments at [LOC Copenhagen  ] and the [LOC United States  ] does not take these commitments lightly and ( 2 ) the [ORG Accord  ] is the result of a long and arduous process - there is no plan B for negotiation of a different agreement. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Hedegaard  ] asked about [ORG China’s  ] perceptions on the [ORG Accord  ] . 
[PER Pershing  ] said the letter from Premier Wen to [ORG UN  ] Secretary general [PER Ban Ki Moon  ] and [MISC Danish  ] Prime Minister [PER Rasmussen  ] was positive , but he was more concerned about communications from [PER Su Wei  ] , [ORG China’s Climate Negotiator  ] . 
He noted that there had been no formal bilateral climate discussions between the [LOC US  ] and [LOC China  ] since [LOC Copenhagen  ] , but indicated that these would likely resume in February . 
[PER Pershing  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG EU  ] must deal with [LOC China  ] , specifically on the subject of transparency . 
[PER Hedegaard  ] then asked “did you agree with [LOC China  ] on MRV or not ? 
I was presented with a paper that [LOC China  ] , [LOC India  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] could agree upon.” [PER Pershing  ] replied: “the question is whether they will honor that language.” [PER Hedegaard  ] said she does not have high expectations for COP 16 in [LOC Mexico  ] and that we must avoid the expectations that it will resolve all of the unanswered problems from [LOC Copenhagen  ] . 
She asked whether the [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] could be moved into the [ORG LCA  ] ( [ORG Long-term Cooperative Action  ] ) or [ORG KP  ] ( [ORG Kyoto Protocol  ] ) working groups for future discussions . 
[PER Pershing  ] said the two tracks have not yielded much progress but the [ORG LCA  ] would be easier , particularly since the [LOC United States  ] is not a member of [ORG Kyoto  ] . 
He said in theory , the [ORG Accord  ] should guide the work of the COP , but he’s not sure if the BASICs will allow this . 
He said the BASICs , led by [LOC India  ] , are resisting any changes to the [ORG UNFCCC  ] guidelines ( under which developing countries report on their GHG emissions and actions ) . 
He said [MISC African  ] and [MISC Latin American  ] states are looking to turn [LOC Copenhagen  ] into a binding agreement , but the BASICs are opposed to this . 
[PER Hedegaard  ] suggested the [ORG AOSIS  ] ( [ORG Alliance of Small Island States  ] ) countries “could be our best allies” given their need for financing. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Hedegaard  ] said that in light of the [ORG BASIC  ] announcement , the [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG EU  ] must coordinate more closely . 
She asked whether the [ORG MEF  ] process should be continued and suggested a meeting of Annex I countries . 
[PER Pershing  ] said the forum for further discussions has not been resolved , but he suggested that non-members could be invited to participate in [ORG MEF  ] discussions . 
He said a meeting of the [ORG MEF  ] ministers prior to the May/June meeting in [LOC Bonn  ] could help frame expectations for [LOC Mexico  ] . 
[PER Hedegaard  ] said she supports the [ORG MEF  ] process but said a constructive signal from the COP at [LOC Bonn  ] will be important . 
[LOC BRUSSELS  ] 00000186 002 OF 002 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Hedegaard  ] asked if the [LOC U.S.  ] was prepared to move forward on [ORG Fast Start  ] funding . 
She said some countries like [LOC Japan  ] and the [LOC UK  ] will press the inclusion of loan guarantees as part of the package and asked whether the [LOC U.S.  ] will need to do any “creative accounting. “ She added: “$30 billion had been promised - - it cannot be lent.” She asked for [MISC Pershing’s  ] thought on the [PER Soros  ] proposal , which she said was “tempting in the long-term , ” but she is not sure it will work for [ORG Fast Start  ] funding . 
[ Note: In December 2010 [PER George Soros  ] proposed that developed countries return their [ORG IMF  ] special drawing rights ( [ORG SDRs  ] ) to the [ORG IMF  ] , which could in turn lend the funds to developing countries for mitigation and adaptation . 
[PER Soros  ] estimated the amount from [ORG SDRs  ] could provide about $150 billion . 
End note . 
] [PER Pershing  ] replied that this proposal is just another form of loan guarantee , and we were skeptical of its utility ; he also said he would share our analysis on it . 
On [ORG Fast Track  ] financing , [PER Pershing  ] said the administration anticipated the need and budgeted funds in 2010 and 2011 . 
He said some [LOC U.S.  ] funding would be directly applied for mitigation and adaptation and other sources would be indirect , citing for example program funds from various agencies and funds for food security . 
He concurred that it would be valuable to agree on what funds would be included in each country’s reporting , and said donors have to balance the political need to provide real financing with the practical constraints of tight budgets . 
He suggested that the small group of key donors - those that provide about 90% of the financing - convene quickly to discuss this issue. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 .
