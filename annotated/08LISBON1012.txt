( C ) Summary . 
In the race to lead the major center-right party , the able and unifying [PER Manuela Ferreira Leite  ] faces the polarizing but canny [PER Pedro Santana Lopes  ] . 
[PER Santana Lopes  ] , a former party leader and Prime Minister , has a significant faction behind him , but his widely disparaged government makes many party faithful wish to look elsewhere . 
[PER Ferreira Leite  ] 's broad appeal , both in the party and with the overall electorate , makes her the legitimate favorite . 
End summary . 
Heading ------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) After six months on the job , leader of the center-right [ORG Social Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG PSD  ] ) [PER Luis Filipe Menezes  ] resigned his position April 17 . 
[PER Menezes  ] was never able to repair the internal party divisions resulting from his own successful 2007 challenge to former leader [PER Luis Marques Mendes  ] , nor was he able to demonstrate a viable challenge to the [ORG Socialist Party  ] government led by Prime Minister [PER Jose Socrates.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Candidacies to replace him have been muddled by conflicted loyalties and overlapping support factions within the party . 
Party number two [PER Rui Rio  ] , Mayor of [LOC Porto  ] , refused to present a candidacy which cleared the way for [PER Manuela Ferreira Leite  ] , a former Minister of Education and of Finance and a technocrat with broad appeal . 
She is a protege of President [PER Cavaco Silva  ] , who is [LOC Portugal  ] 's most popular politician and she is broadly respected for her intellect and experience. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) One of [PER Ferreira Leite  ] 's strengths is that she had refused to serve in the short-lived and widely disparaged government of [PER Pedro Santana Lopes  ] in 2004-5 . 
[PER Santana Lopes  ] himself , however , is expected to declare his candidacy for the May election in the coming days . 
[PER Santana Lopes  ] is everything [PER Ferreira Leite  ] is not: a life-long politician , aggressive and confrontational . 
Also , as a former leader and Prime Minister , [PER Santana Lopes  ] has a grip on a strong faction within the party , despite having led the [ORG PSD  ] to its worst-ever defeat in 2005 . 
[LOC Santana Lopes'  ] political career , written off by many , was revived recently when [PER Menezes  ] named him leader of the [ORG PSD  ] bloc in the [ORG National Assembly  ] . 
Ironically , [PER Menezes  ] did so in an attempt to smooth over internal party divisions. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) There are three other declared candidates , including a parliamentarian and former youth leader running on a platform of " change " , the deputy leader of the [ORG PSD  ] parliamentary bloc , and a successful entrepreneur , although none of the three are considered viable candidates . 
Party insiders tell us the former youth leader is hoping to raise his profile , while both he and the deputy parliamentary leader harbor hope to emerge as a compromise candidate , should [PER Ferreira Leite  ] and [PER Santana Lopes  ] battle to a standstill . 
The entrepreneur , who cheerfully admits he might not gather enough signatures in time to be an official candidate , hopes to keep debate focused on basic center-right party principles rather than political posturing or personal attacks . 
Nonetheless , he too hopes to be a compromise candidate , given his extensive experience in business , government , and academia. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) In addition to [PER Rui Rio  ] , several other major party figures chose not to present candidacies . 
[PER Menezes  ] allegedly implored [MISC Madeiran  ] President [PER Alberto Joao Jardim  ] to stand , but [PER Jardim  ] refused and endorsed [PER Santana Lopes  ] . 
Many observers viewed former Minister of Justice [PER Jose Pedro Aguiar Branco  ] as a serious candidate , but he refused to stand because he favors [PER Ferreira Leite  ] . 
Neither [PER Marques Mendes  ] nor [PER Menezes  ] is challenging for the leadership , although some believe that [PER Menezes  ] might still return to the fight . 
Comment ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) It is essentially a choice between the able and unifying [PER Ferreira Leite  ] or the polarizing but canny [PER Santana Lopes  ] . 
Neither is charismatic , but that is not seen as a particular hindrance in [MISC Portuguese  ] politics . 
As leader of the [ORG PSD  ] bench , [PER Santana Lopes  ] faces Prime Minister [PER Socrates  ] on a daily basis , but has made no noticeable headway against him . 
[PER Ferreira Leite  ] would be a much more formidable [ORG PSD  ] leader in the 2009 general elections due to the broad respect she commands across the electorate , but she will need to navigate the party leadership election without drawing too much blood to have that chance . 
[PER Santana Lopes  ] is tainted with the stench of defeat , so we expect the party to turn to [PER Ferreira Leite  ] . 
Whoever wins will have the challenge of turning the [ORG PSD  ] into a credible alternative to the [ORG PS  ] and Prime Minister [PER Socrates  ] , who remains the least unpopular of major party leaders .
