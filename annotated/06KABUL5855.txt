( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY: Reports are circulating at [LOC PRT Chaghcharan  ] that the [MISC Icelandic  ] government may be preparing to withdraw the [ORG Icelandic Mobile Patrol Team  ] ( [ORG Mobile Liaison Observation Team/MLOT  ] ) from [LOC Afghanistan  ] at the end of April . 
Because of its makeup , special equipment , and experience driving in the kind of harsh terrain found in [LOC Ghor  ] province , the [MISC Icelandic  ] team has been especially effective in conducting patrols . 
Moreover , through its reliability , efforts to pass on skills to other patrol units , and unique rescue capability , the [PER Icelanders  ] have made the [ORG PRT  ] as a whole much more effective . 
Because of the potentially serious consequences for [LOC PRT Chaghcharan  ] , Post suggests Department intervene with [MISC Icelandic  ] authorities to underscore the value we attach to the work of the [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG MLOT  ] team and request its mission be extended . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC U.S.  ] PolRep in [LOC Chaghcharan  ] recently learned from the [ORG PRT  ] , s [MISC Icelandic  ] development officer that her government may withdraw the [ORG Icelandic Mobile Liaison Observation Team  ] ( [ORG MLOT  ] ) at the end of April 2007 , when the current MOU with the [MISC Lithuanian  ] government runs out . 
When questioned about this , the head of the [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG MLOT  ] confirmed the report . 
His team will rotate out in February , and its successor is scheduled to remain only two months , instead of the usual four . 
Speculation at [LOC PRT Chaghcharan  ] is that the new [MISC Icelandic  ] foreign minister may be looking to remove the issue of [LOC Iceland  ] 's &military8 mission in [LOC Afghanistan  ] in advance of upcoming national elections and so may be considering replacing the [ORG MLOT  ] with police trainers to give the mission a more civilian face or redefining the [ORG MLOT  ] , s mission as solely to support development activities. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The prospect of [LOC Iceland  ] withdrawing or redefining its [ORG MLOT  ] raises serious concerns for us . 
The [MISC Lithuanian  ] [ORG PRT  ] commander shares our concerns and is anxious for the [MISC Icelandic  ] team to continue in its present form . 
Certainly the [MISC Lithuanians  ] , [MISC Croats  ] , and [MISC Danes  ] all conduct valuable patrols in their assigned districts , but the [MISC Icelandic  ] team is unique in the resources and skills it brings to its designated patrols . 
The [PER Icelanders  ] , and only the [PER Icelanders  ] , have truly all-weather vehicles ( [PER Nissan Patrols  ] ) capable of operating throughout mountainous and often snow-bound [LOC Ghor  ] . 
They alone have the 388 ( summer ) and 448 ( winter ) tires that allow the vehicles to handle the province 's extremely rough terrain ( there are no paved roads anywhere in [LOC Ghor  ] ) . 
The [PER Icelanders  ] are particularly adept at using their GPS and onboard laptops to chart their course , allowing them to travel without difficulty even at night . 
The makeup of their team , consisting of &civilian specialists , 8 also gives them special advantages . 
The current team , for example , includes two counter-terrorism policemen , a search and rescue worker , skilled drivers , a paramedic , and a mechanic ( who participates in the patrols ) . 
The result to date has been remarkable reliability for the team 's missions , and particularly valuable and insightful reporting. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Beyond the value they add through their patrols , however , the [PER Icelanders  ] contribute in unique ways to the [ORG PRT  ] as a whole ) - something that causes us to be especially concerned at the prospect of their departure . 
A major problem for all the other patrols is a lack of experience at driving under the harsh mountain conditions of [LOC Ghor  ] . 
The [PER Icelanders  ] suggest the terrain in [LOC Ghor  ] resembles in many respects the conditions they face at home . 
Unlike the other elements , the [MISC Icelandic  ] team is used to off-road driving up steep inclines and fording rivers . 
Importantly , they make every effort to pass on to the other elements their special driving skills . 
( The [PER Icelanders  ] in [LOC Chaghcharan  ] argue that turning over their vehicles to other [ORG PRT  ] elements at the end of April , as some in [LOC Reykjavik  ] appear to be suggesting , would result in a waste of the major investment [LOC Iceland  ] has made in bringing the vehicles to [LOC Afghanistan  ] because , without the corresponding special driving skills and ride-along mechanic , they predict the vehicles would soon become as vulnerable to problems as the rest of the [ORG PRT  ] 's vehicle fleet . 
) Moreover , with winter just now settling in , the [PER Icelanders  ] have already had occasion to rescue other units , stranded vehicles , and as conditions worsen , they have been paired up increasingly with other units as a safeguard ) - a bit to the frustration of the [PER Icelanders  ] themselves. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Both the [ORG PRT  ] , s [MISC Icelandic  ] development officer and [ORG MLOT  ] chief express frustration that the message of the [ORG MLOT  ] 's true mission does not appear to be getting back to the public at home ( a major [MISC Icelandic  ] newspaper reportedly declined to publish an account of the [ORG MLOT  ] 's work written by a former team chief ) . 
To characterize the [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG MLOT  ] as a &military8 mission is largely a misnomer , they insist . 
The team 's rules of engagement do not allow it to participate in combat except in self-defense , its members are not part of the [ORG PRT  ] , s quick response force , and they do not perform guard duty . 
The [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG MLOT  ] chief characterizes his unit 's real mission as to give the people of its assigned districts a greater sense of security by its presence , to find out their needs , concerns , and ideas , and to feed these back into the reconstruction effort . 
He acknowledges that [LOC Iceland  ] has the resources to contribute to the [ORG PRT  ] 's effort in [LOC Ghor  ] in many ways , be it with its police trainers , health care workers , or engineers ; but , he argues , the core mission of the [ORG PRT  ] is performing patrols and his team does them uniquely well and makes an all but irreplaceable contribution to enabling the other elements to perform theirs effectively too . 
Whatever else [LOC Iceland  ] might decide to contribute , he is distraught at the potential discarding of what he sees as a mission genuinely helpful to [LOC Afghanistan  ] and its ultimate development . 
Both we and the [ORG PRT  ] commander share his concern. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Action Request: Given the particularly valuable contribution to [LOC PRT Chaghcharan  ] provided by the [ORG Icelandic Mobile Liaison Observation Team  ] and the serious downside ) including added burden on others -- its withdrawal from patrol work would present , Post requests Department consider asking Embassy [LOC Reykjavik  ] to contact appropriate [MISC Icelandic  ] officials to underscore our appreciation for the special work being done by the [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG MLOT  ] in [LOC Ghor  ] and to request that [LOC Reykjavik  ] seriously consider extending its mission .
