[PER Charles H. Rivkin  ] for Reasons 1.5 ( b ) ( d ) Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [MISC French  ] Environment Minister [PER Jean-Louis Borloo  ] told the Ambassador that the key to advancing climate negotiations is to drop the notion of a legally binding treaty in favor of a system of national commitments . 
He also argued that it would be up to a small group of eight or ten heads of state , and their sherpas , to negotiate implementation of the [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] . 
[PER Borloo  ] attributed the [MISC European  ] obsession with legally binding treaties to its post-war history and experience in creating the [ORG EU  ] by progressively ceding sovereignty via treaty . 
The key to reaching this kind of deal would be credible action on tradable quotas , forests , and finance including innovative financing mechanisms . 
The [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] was not a failure , but allowing the means to become the ends was a trap . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Rivkin  ] called on Minister of State for [ORG Sustainable Development  ] [PER Jean-Louis Borloo  ] on February 11 to review the [ORG Copenhagen Conference  ] and next steps on the [ORG Accord  ] . 
They had last met on the eve of the conference ( reftel . 
) [PER Borloo  ] expressed in several different ways the idea that [LOC Copenhagen  ] had gone off track because its approach had been too [MISC Western  ] and too [MISC European  ] . 
Major emerging countries were not prepared to cede sovereignty to a treaty , while [ORG EU  ] members saw this as both normal and essential . 
[PER Borloo  ] observed that [LOC Copenhagen  ] had , in fact , established a possible global deal on emissions reductions by the [LOC United States  ] , [LOC China  ] , and [LOC Europe  ] . 
We will not get beyond this balance at the next [ORG Conference of the Parties  ] ( COP ) in [LOC Cancun  ] , he said. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Borloo  ] insisted that [ORG UNFCCC  ] COP negotiators did not have the ability to close a deal after years of ongoing negotiations . 
It was now up to the major heads of state . 
He suggested a group of eight or ten: [LOC Germany  ] and [LOC France  ] for [LOC Europe  ] , the [LOC United States  ] , [LOC China  ] , [LOC India  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Algeria  ] and [LOC Ethiopia  ] ( and possibly [LOC South Africa  ] ) . 
Once these leaders , working through their sherpas or personal representatives agree on an implementation plan for [LOC Copenhagen  ] , it will be largely acceptable to , and accepted by , the rest of the world , and can then be returned to a [ORG UN  ] forum to be finalized . 
( [PER Borloo  ] dismissed the role of [LOC Spain  ] as the current [ORG EU  ] Presidency country , saying that [LOC Spain  ] has exceeded its [ORG Kyoto Protocol  ] targets by 50 percent and is mired by its internal economic situation . 
The [ORG United Nations  ] also did not have any leadership capacity to advance the negotiations , he said . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Borloo  ] argued that the key to implementing the " equilibrium " revealed at [LOC Copenhagen  ] was an arrangement that would be voluntary but also automatic in implementation and would include tradable emissions quotas ( with linked carbon markets ) , a forestry mechanism ( [ORG REDD Plus  ] ) , and financing , including innovative financing and a fast start mechanism . 
He commented that [LOC China  ] would agree to such a system as far preferable to a [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG EU  ] carbon border tax or tariff arrangement. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Borloo  ] thought that adhesion to the [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] would be more than adequate to establish its acceptance , and he expected most of [LOC Africa  ] and three quarters of the island states to sign on . 
He relayed that [LOC France  ] continues to advocate adhesion and said that he personally was travelling and meeting with key country counterparts , including [LOC China  ] and [LOC India.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) COMMENT: [PER Borloo  ] conveyed a strategic view of these negotiations that has changed significantly . 
We note especially his assessment that a legally binding instrument is not only unnecessary but also impossible . 
He stressed that unlike some [MISC Europeans  ] , the [MISC French  ] understood the [ORG USG  ] position and had not been critical of the [LOC United States  ] at [LOC Copenhagen  ] . 
In fact , he said , the success of the [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] for the [ORG USG  ] had been the direct engagement of President [PER Obama  ] . 
END COMMENT. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) [PER Borloo  ] also passed a letter from himself , on behalf of the [MISC French  ] people , to Secretary of Energy [PER Chu  ] expressing condolences for the loss of life at the [ORG Kleen Energy Power  ] plant in [LOC Middletown  ] , [LOC Connecticut  ] , and expressing his wish that those injured in the explosion recover quickly . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] has faxed the letter to the [ORG Department of Energy  ] .
