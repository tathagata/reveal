End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG National Security Advisor General  ] [PER James Jones  ] , Ambassador , and delegation from the [ORG National Security Council  ] met President [PER Zardari  ] and a [MISC GOP  ] delegation at the Presidency on June 25 . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] 's military campaign in [LOC Malakand  ] and [MISC Waziristan  ] had been positively noted in the [LOC U.S.  ] , said [PER Jones  ] , which welcomed the display of resolve . 
The trendline in relations between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] was positive , said [PER Jones  ] . 
[PER Zardari  ] rejoined that the most important component of the relationship was the goodwill expressed by the [ORG USG  ] toward [LOC Pakistan  ] ; his own tenure in office ( ten months ) was short and his popularity not high , but goodwill from [LOC America  ] was central to his and [LOC Pakistan  ] 's future. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [LOC Pakistan  ] was united , said [PER Zardari:  ] the people have the will to support the military in its campaign to stop the taliban/extremists operating in the country . 
He cautioned that the fight against militant extremism would be a long one , lasting not months but many , many years and that lack of vigilance on the [MISC GOP  ] 's part would be devastating . 
As confident as he was of the military 's resolve -- this time -- to fight [MISC Pakistani  ] militancy , he was equally convinced that any failure to maintain pressure on the militants after showing such resolve would have grave consequences. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) President [PER Zardari  ] thanked the [LOC U.S.  ] for its assistance while stating he needed " a battalion of helicopters " to fight the extremists now , and in the future . 
He also made repeated pleas for drones to be " put in [LOC Pakistan  ] 's hands " so that [LOC Pakistan  ] would own the issue and drone attacks ( including collateral damage ) would not provoke anti-americanism . 
[PER Zardari  ] said the technology behind them was not cutting-edge and said he has raised the issue with the Chairman of the [ORG Joint Chiefs of Staff.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Journalist [PER Bob Woodward  ] ( traveling with the [ORG NSA Jones  ] delegation ) joined the meeting later and asked [PER Zardari  ] why he had sharpened his attack on the extremists in the last six months . 
" Organization , " replied [PER Zardari  ] , who noted he had been in office a short time and had used the first four months to prepare . 
Pointing to the death of his father-in-law [PER Zulfikar Bhutto  ] and assassination of his wife , [PER Benazir  ] , [PER Zardari  ] said he had been confronting extremism ( or the ideology from which it was birthed ) for more than thirty years . 
His wife had been targeted for assassination as early as 1988 , when she was viewed as a symbol of feminism and all that it represented . 
The [ORG Pakistan Peoples Party  ] ( [ORG PPP  ] ) of which he was the head ( like the [MISC Bhuttos  ] before him ) had always been ousted from power by the military , said [PER Zardari  ] , which previously had been aligned with fundamentalism. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG Jones  ] asked [PER Zardari  ] how he viewed relations in the region and told [PER Zardari  ] President [PER Obama  ] 's own policy toward [LOC Iran  ] would have to be reexamined given events unfolding there . 
Whatever had happened during the election , [MISC Iranian  ] leadership could not pretend nothing had occurred and return as if there had been no shift. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Zardari  ] noted that several tri-lateral forums had been created in the region with the ostensible purpose of supporting [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
He counseled that the [ORG USG  ] must " cooperate with [LOC Turkey  ] , and [LOC Iran  ] , " acknowledging at the same time that the [MISC GOP  ] too was perplexed and disappointed by what had happened in [LOC Iran  ] . 
As to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , he said all countries had to be encouraged -- even if ( as in the case of [LOC Russia  ] ) , only to be urged not to meddle . 
[PER Zardari  ] accused [LOC India  ] of providing the precursor chemicals necessary to produce heroine , which he said was funding the taliban in [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Asked by [ORG NSA Jones  ] , what was the best that could be hoped for in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Zardari  ] spoke of substituting hybrid corn for poppies , even if at a subsidized price , to [LOC ISLAMABAD  ] 00001438 002 OF 002 wean farmers from the opium trade . 
He said [LOC China  ] might be interested or persuaded to invest in the venture . 
[PER Zardari  ] 's vision was to use that corn for ethanol production ; he welcomed the indication of interest shown by [ORG National Geographic  ] CEO [PER John Fahey  ] , and invited him to return to [LOC Pakistan  ] for a briefing on the concept. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) More broadly , [PER Zardari  ] praised the industriousness of the [MISC Pashtun  ] people . 
Currently they were " very good warriors , " but they were also natural entrepreneurs and the hardest working people of [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
If their entrepreneurial power could be unleashed , the problems " in the [MISC Pashtun  ] belt " would largely be resolved. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Over the medium term , [LOC Pakistan  ] had to built its economy so that is could pay its own expenses to combat extremism , added [PER Zardari  ] , who thought this possible if exports could be increased three-fold . 
( He said he would raise the issue with [ORG National Security Council Senior  ] Director [PER Lipton  ] in his upcoming visit to [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
) He thanked the [ORG USG  ] for all it was doing to aid [LOC Pakistan  ] and asked for more financial assistance. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Zardari  ] signaled that there had been some progress in his talks with [MISC Indian  ] PM [PER Singh  ] in [LOC Russia  ] , even though he had noted earlier that [LOC India  ] 's military capacity was ten-fold [LOC Pakistan  ] 's . 
He regretted not being able to meet [PER Singh  ] at the upcoming [LOC Sharm  ] el-Sheikh summit but , he said , " unfortunately , PM [PER Gilani  ] had already announced he would be going to [LOC Sharm  ] " ( sic ) . 
In his meeting with [PER Singh  ] , said [PER Zardari  ] , he had underscored that " there could not be a better political moment " to improve relations across the board . 
[LOC India  ] was a mature democracy and an ancient nation , said [PER Zardari  ] . 
" [PER Singh  ] is an excellent economist , " he said , but [PER Zardari  ] was not convinced the [MISC Indian  ] Prime Minister understood the constraints under which [PER Zardari  ] was operating . 
Helping [PER Singh  ] to understand them was of import , hinted [PER Zardari  ] . 
[ORG NSC Senior  ] Director [PER Don Camp  ] said the [MISC Indian  ] perspective was to question [MISC GOP  ] activism and to ask what it had done to quash terrorist organizations . 
[ORG NSA Jones  ] reminded [PER Zardari  ] how important it was to ensure there was not another Mumbai-style attack . 
[PER Zardari  ] reiterated that [PER Singh  ] was unaware of what it took to " change the mind-set of [LOC Pakistan  ] 's " establishment , " given [LOC Pakistan  ] 's short history of fragile democratic regimes toppled by the military. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 .
