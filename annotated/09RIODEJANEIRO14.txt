[LOC U.S.  ] oil companies [ORG Exxon  ] and [ORG Hess  ] , together with [MISC Brazilian  ] partner [ORG Petrobras  ] , have found evidence of oil in their highly anticipated pre-salt exploration block in [LOC Brazil  ] 's [LOC Santos Basin  ] . 
[ORG Exxon  ] , which operates the well , and [ORG Hess  ] each own 40 percent of the concession while 20 percent is held by [ORG Petrobras.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
The discovery was made at well 1ESSO3SPS ( test well that began drilling in October 2008 ) in the [MISC BM-S-22  ] block at a water depth of 2,223 meters ( 7,294 feet ) , the [ORG National Petroleum Agency  ] released on January 20 . 
The companies haven't determined if the find can be developed commercially but energy insiders expect the discovery in this block , called " [MISC Azulao  ] " , to be larger than the neighboring " [MISC Tupi  ] " block which is currently the largest confirmed pre-salt find at 5-8 million barrels . 
The [MISC Azulao  ] block lies at the apex of what geologist consider the largest structure of the pre-salt oil and gas reserves. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
Unrelated to the [MISC Azulao  ] announcement , [ORG Exxon  ] CEO [PER Rex Tillerson  ] visited [LOC Brazil  ] last week . 
His trip took place among speculation that , with almost $37 billion of cash on hand , the company may be positioning for a major deal . 
Rumors circulating include a takeover of [LOC Shell  ] , a merger with [ORG BG Group  ] ( which also holds a major stake in [LOC Brazil  ] pre-salt ) , or a partnership with [ORG Petrobras  ] to finance and develop pre-salt oil development in [LOC Brazil  ] .
