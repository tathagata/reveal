ISLAMABAD 2972 Classified By: [PER Anne W. Patterson  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Summary:  ] The [MISC Pakistani  ] military is continuing its counterinsurgency efforts along the main corridors of [MISC South Waziristan  ] and the northern and central FATA with low level search and clear operations . 
[ORG Frontier Corps  ] operations in [LOC Bajaur  ] remain on hold , awaiting additional forces . 
Meanwhile , humanitarian assistance ( food and non-food items ) is reaching both the approximately 12,000 families displaced from [LOC Orakzai  ] and the approximately 38,000 families displaced from [MISC South Waziristan  ] . 
Of the displaced , only a few , perhaps one hundred families , are in a camp . 
End Summary . 
SOUTH WAZIRISTAN: CLEARING OPERATIONS CONTINUE --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In [MISC South Waziristan  ] , units assigned to the 11th Corps continue to conduct small-scale clearing operations on major and secondary line of communication ( [ORG LOCs  ] ) and in built-up areas . 
Units of the 7th Division hold [PER Makin  ] and [LOC Razmak  ] on the northern axis ; the 9th Division holds the southwest axis from [LOC Wana  ] while the 14th Division continues to secure the [ORG LOC  ] to [LOC Jandola  ] in the south east . 
All division continue to conduct search and clear operations . 
We do not expect any major new operations in [MISC South Waziristan  ] for the moment . 
There has been talk of an additional push , but [MISC Pakistani  ] military contacts have indicated to us that troop rotations and resupply requirements mean any additional effort would not happen before March . 
BAJAUR: WAITING FOR A MAJOR OFFENSIVE ------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In [LOC Bajaur Agency  ] , [ORG Pakistan Army  ] troops remain deployed along the [LOC Charmung  ] and [LOC Watalai Valley  ] , with additional checkpoints in place near [LOC Khar  ] to screen vehicles entering and leaving the [LOC Watalai Valley  ] -- an indication of possible preparations for a future operation . 
[LOC U.S.  ] provided Intelligence targets of interest in [LOC Bajaur Agency  ] 's [LOC Mamund Valley  ] and provide coordinates for artillery strikes and future [ORG Pakistan Air Force  ] air strikes . 
It is likely these operations will continue through the end of January. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Pakistan Military  ] and [ORG Frontier Corps  ] forces appear to be delaying the start of a planned three-week offensive in the [LOC Mamund Valley  ] , originally scheduled to start on January 6 , because of a request for two additional [ORG Army  ] battalions for clearing operations . 
The additional forces are the 14th [ORG Punjab Battalion  ] ( from [LOC Kwazakhela  ] , [LOC Swat  ] , the 12th [ORG Northern Light Infantry Battalion  ] ( from [LOC Sialkot  ] , [LOC Punjab  ] ) and the 4th [ORG Commando Battalion  ] and [ORG Karrar Company  ] of the [ORG Special Services Group  ] battalion ( the [ORG Pakistan Army  ] 's [ORG Special Forces  ] ) . 
In addition , the [ORG 2nd Wing of the Tocho Scouts  ] ( currently in [LOC Bajaur  ] ) may be relieved by a wing of the [ORG Chitral Scouts  ] , who just completed [ORG FCTC  ] training at [LOC Warsak  ] . 
INCREASED CHECKPOINTS --------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Access to [LOC Orakzai Agency  ] from the surrounding four agencies and districts has been blocked by security forces , and artillery and armor have moved to the [ORG Khyber  ] and [LOC Kurram  ] borders with [LOC Orakzai  ] . 
This coupled with the repositioning of artillery and armor assets in [LOC Kurram  ] and [ORG Khyber  ] suggests additional operations are imminent against [ORG TTP  ] insurgents in western [LOC Orakzai  ] or [PER Tariq Afridi  ] militants in the [PER Darra Adam Khel  ] region of [LOC NWFP  ] . 
INFRASTRUCTURE RECONSTRUCTION ----------------------------- ISLAMABAD 00000175 002 OF 002 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) On December 31 , 2009 , [PER USAID  ] signed and [ORG Implementation Letter  ] ( [ORG IL  ] ) with the [ORG FATA Secretariat  ] for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of water , road and energy infrastructure in [MISC South Waziristan  ] . 
[PER USAID  ] will reimburse the [ORG FATA Secretariat  ] for work completed according to pre-agreed costs and specifications . 
The [MISC GOP  ] is currently preparing the specifications and cost estimates for the projects , with an initial emphasis on a major road between Tank and Makeen . 
Once the design and cost estimate has been completed and approved , [PER USAID  ] will advance the [ORG FATA Secretariat  ] 15 percent of the cost to cover mobilization expenses , with additional funding to be disbursed after the work is completed . 
The [ORG FATA Secretariat  ] is contracting the [ORG Frontier Works Organization  ] ( [ORG FWO  ] ) to implement the road projects . 
In a January 14 meeting with [PER USAID  ] , [ORG FWO  ] confirmed that it had mobilized a team in [MISC South Waziristan  ] to complete the design and cost estimates . 
ASSISTANCE TO ORAKZAI AND SWA DISPLACED --------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Humanitarian assistance - food and non-food items ( [MISC NFI  ] ) - is reaching both the approximately 12,000 families displaced from [LOC Orakzai  ] and the approximately 38,000 families displaced from [MISC South Waziristan  ] . 
Of the [LOC Orakzai  ] displaced , the 8,000 families in [LOC Kohat  ] have received [MISC NFI  ] through [ORG UNHCR  ] , and the rest , who are in [LOC Hangu  ] , are supported by [ORG ICRC  ] . 
Only a very few -- perhaps one hundred families -- are in a camp . 
While the [LOC Orakzai  ] displaced do not receive cash payments from the Government of [LOC Pakistan  ] , they are supported with food from the [ORG World Food Program  ] ( [ORG WFP  ] ) . <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Those registered displaced ( members of the [MISC Mehsud  ] tribe ) from [MISC South Waziristan  ] are primarily in [LOC DI Khan  ] and Tank where they have received ample non-food items from [ORG UNHCR  ] . 
They receive a one-month food distribution from [ORG WFP  ] upon registration and then are entitled to government payments of PKR 5,000 ( about $60 ) a month . 
Those who do not yet have activated government cash cards continue to receive [ORG WFP  ] food. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) For military and strategic purposes , the [MISC GOP  ] does not recognize members of the neighboring [MISC Bhittani  ] tribe as conflict-displaced IDPs and hence has not designated them as eligible for government payments . 
Recently , however , [ORG UNHCR  ] was pleased to be able to win government permission to register the [MISC Bhittani  ] displaced unofficially and to see that they receive humanitarian assistance . 
A total of some 2,000 [MISC Bhittani  ] families are being registered in [LOC DI Khan  ] and Tank , and when this registration is completed in the next few days , this group will benefit from [MISC NFI  ] and food distributions. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Even prior to the security forces' blocking of access to [LOC Orakzai Agency  ] , humanitarian actors have not been able to provide assistance within [LOC Orakzai  ] or [MISC South Waziristan  ] . 
Humanitarian organizations have begun planning , however , for possible assistance upon the eventual return of IDPs to areas of displacement . 
They have received some indications from the military to expect the beginning of this return in [LOC March.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Comment: As  ] we have previously noted , the [ORG Army  ] 's [MISC South Waziristan  ] campaign has significantly eroded the [ORG TTP  ] 's command and control , but has not destroyed the [ORG TTP  ] network , whose fighters melted away in [MISC South Waziristan  ] or fled to other [ORG FATA  ] agencies , rather than put up stiff resistance . 
The [ORG Army  ] still faces a long road ahead in rooting out the [ORG TTP  ] in [MISC South Waziristan  ] and pursuing [ORG TTP  ] elements elsewhere in the [ORG FATA  ] .
