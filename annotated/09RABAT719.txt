( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] The [MISC Moroccan  ] judicial system suffers from both a lack of independence and a lack of public confidence , and it remains an impediment to the country 's development and reform efforts . 
Recognizing these problems , King [PER Mohammed VI  ] has called for a comprehensive reform of the judicial system to include greater independence and efficiency , but it is as yet unclear how committed the Government is to making meaningful reforms . 
Judges are not even minimally independent of the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] , and officials use direct intervention , career consequences , and political pressure to influence outcomes . 
This is further exacerbated by many judges' inability to apply the law correctly , even without outside meddling . 
Judicial incompetence and lack of independence are stumbling blocks that the [ORG GOM  ] and the King must overcome to achieve their stated social and political reform goals . 
The [ORG Mission  ] will continue to assist as the Government demonstrates its willingness to act . 
End Summary. ------------------------- The King [PER Announces  ] a Plan ------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( SBU ) On August 21 , the King , looking healthier and thinner than he has in years , unveiled the framework of his much-anticipated judicial reform plan , which focused on six priorities: -- a more independent judiciary ; -- modernizing the legal system to include a new penal policy , the establishment of a national crime observatory , and the promotion of alternative sentencing mechanisms ; -- upgrading administrative mechanisms in the court system and delegating authority to judicial officers ; -- upgrading training and performance of judges and judicial staff ; -- increasing efficiency , and -- preventing corruption . 
He appointed the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] to develop and implement these priorities , explaining that judicial reform would support the other major modernization and development projects initiated by the Palace . 
The plan comes at a time of general public disaffection with the judiciary and amid calls for greater judicial independence from [MISC Moroccan  ] non-governmental organizations ( [ORG NGOs  ] ) . ----------------------------------------- Phone Call [ORG Justice  ] and Political Meddling ----------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) When [PER PolOff  ] asked prominent judicial reform activist [PER Abdelaziz Nouyidi  ] to comment on the degree of judicial independence in [LOC Morocco  ] , he laughed . 
" When it deals with anything political , there is zero independence . 
When it has to do with the press , there is zero independence . 
With all other cases , there is more room for independence , but not very much , " he told [PER PolOff  ] . 
[PER Nouyidi  ] described an encounter with a judge who received a phone call from the [ORG Ministry of the Interior  ] during their conversation . 
The judge , responding to the caller 's questions , stated , " The verdict was what you wanted . 
" [PER Nouyidi  ] said the judge immediately became embarrassed by having this conversation in front of an activist for judicial reform , but had been so accustomed to reporting on his cases to ministry officials that he had forgotten to be discreet. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the lack of independence allows the court system to be manipulated into an instrument of political repression . 
" Other countries use the army or the police to control politics , " he mused , " but in [LOC Morocco  ] , we use the justice system . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In one recent case , Said [PER Yabou  ] , an attorney and member of the [ORG Istiqlal Party  ] ( [ORG PI  ] ) , was elected Council President of [ORG Youssoufia  ] ( a township outside of [LOC Rabat  ] ) , in an alliance with the [ORG Islamist-inspired Party of Justice and Development  ] ( [ORG PJD  ] ) . 
The hotly contested council election required the intervention of security forces to prevent serious clashes between the [MISC PI-PJD  ] coalition and the rival coalition made up of the [ORG Popular Movement Party  ] ( [ORG MP  ] ) and the [ORG Party of Authenticity and Modernity  ] ( [ORG PAM  ] ) . 
Immediately after winning the council presidency , and in violation of the code for lawyers and proper procedure , [PER Yabou  ] was arrested on charges of fraud . 
He was speedily convicted , sentenced to two years in prison and lost his council seat . 
Several contacts speculated that this was an entirely political move , and illustrated the way in which the judiciary may be used to achieve political ends. --------------------- No Legal Independence ----------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Despite language in the [MISC Moroccan  ] constitution asserting the judiciary 's independence from the legislative and executive branches , this is not implemented . 
According to [PER Francois Ramsey  ] , the Director of the [ORG American Bar Association  ] ( [ORG ABA  ] ) in [LOC Morocco  ] , there is no judicial independence . 
The [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] ( [ORG MOJ  ] ) is one of five Ministries under the direct control of the King , and it hires and fires judges , controls promotions , and decides who can be appointed , and where . 
Judges can become civil servants in the [ORG MOJ  ] , and can also serve concurrently as prosecutors . 
It is not unusual for a judge to serve in his capacity as a magistrate one day , and the next day to serve as a lawyer and defend the interests of the state . 
Legal reform advocates argue that this situation creates conflicts of interest and limits the degree to which judges can make impartial and independent decisions. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [ORG High Judiciary Council  ] , which is headed by the King , oversees the disciplining of judges . 
The Minister of [ORG Justice  ] also serves as a full-time member of the [ORG Council  ] . 
Asked whether any judges had been prosecuted for corruption or other offenses , [PER Rachid Filali Meknassi  ] , Director of [ORG Transparency Maroc  ] , noted that the [ORG High Judiciary Council  ] had sanctioned 70 judges at its last meeting . 
However , he added that " because of the lack of independence , we can't tell if these 'professional faults' were for not following orders from above , or were for actual misdeeds . 
" <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , described the [ORG High Judiciary Council  ] as willing to hold judges accountable for corruption-related offenses , provided there is sufficient evidence . 
He argued , however , that the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] was unlikely to use [ORG Judiciary Council  ] sanctions to punish judges for failing to deliver the desired verdict . 
" If the [ORG Ministry wants  ] to punish a judge for being too independent , " he explained , " they don't bother with the [ORG Council  ] . 
They just appoint him to an unwanted post in the desert somewhere and don't let him get promoted . 
" --------- Influence --------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The [ORG MOJ  ] 's ability to promote or reassign judges makes it difficult for justices to contradict ministry instructions , even if the judge 's independent verdict would be in line with the law . 
[PER Nouyidi  ] , the judicial reform activist , opined , " When judges have not received explicit instructions on a case , they usually act in line with their expectation of ministry preferences , " because of their interest in avoiding the disfavor of ministry authorities , which would risk damaging their careers . 
According to [PER Nouyidi  ] , instructions to judges can come from both inside and outside the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] . 
Power to influence judicial decisions also resides in the hands of Palace insiders or friends , including the Head of the [ORG Supreme Court.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
Ironically , he declined to provide the names of any independent judges , noting that is the duty of the [ORG MOJ  ] . 
" Any meeting would have to be set through them , " he explained , " they control who can talk . 
" He also added that any judge would " be afraid " to take action without first consulting the [ORG Ministry.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] blamed the political system , rather than the individual judges , for the lack of principled decisions by magistrates . 
There are plenty of brave judges who are constrained by politics , he asserted , observing , " When it comes to politics , there is very little room for independence . 
" Citing the irregularities that took place in the June communal elections , including the use of extra-political pressure tactics to influence mayoral elections , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] wondered how 3,000 judges could change the system when even independent political parties succumb to pressure from the State ( Ref A ) . --------------------------- Corruption and Incompetence --------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Filali Meknassi  ] of [ORG Transparency Maroc  ] underlined a growing culture of corruption that has made judges amenable to receiving directions from above without complaint . 
Top level judges can earn as much as USD 4000/month , but even the highest salary is not commensurate with the lavish lifestyle enjoyed by many magistrates , he said. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Particularly in cases that could have important implications , judges are so accustomed to receiving directions on how to rule that they find it difficult to assert their independence , [PER Filali Menknassi  ] explained . 
In addition , the lack of transparency in judicial decisions makes it impossible to determine how many decisions are made under direct government influence . 
A middleman with an agenda could sway judges' decisions by claiming to represent officials in the [ORG Ministry  ] , he observed , and even without specific instructions , the judges may act on their own personal biases rather than the law. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) According to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , the incompetence of judges serves as another major hindrance to independence . 
" A surprising number of judges do not know the law well enough to apply it correctly and therefore have no idea how to make an appropriate decision , " he said . 
Judges therefore often rely on guidance or instructions from the [ORG Ministry  ] as a crutch to compensate for their inability to apply the relevant legal principles . 
In addition to a lack of knowledge about the law , judges receive very little ethics training , compounding the problem , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] added. ------------------------------------ Everyone Agrees It 's Time for Reform ------------------------------------ <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The lack of independence , efficiency , and impartiality in the judiciary remain areas of concern for the [MISC Moroccan  ] public , according to a series of focus group discussions on the judicial system conducted by the [ORG People 's Mirror  ] , the first public opinion research center in the [LOC Arab World  ] . 
Focus group participants expressed their belief that case outcomes " have been decided by the Minister of [ORG Justice  ] in consultation with other actors in the government -- not by the judges , " a sentiment echoed by many embassy contacts . 
Participants emphasized that strengthening and improving the role of the judiciary , particularly judicial independence , are necessary but as yet missing steps in [LOC Morocco  ] 's overall development. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In April , a group of [MISC Moroccan  ] [ORG NGOs  ] submitted recommendations on justice sector reform to the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] . 
Without an independent judiciary , they argued , the success of other reforms , including the advancement of women 's rights and implementation of the new family code , will be limited . 
They called for constitutional and legislative reform to remove the judiciary from executive control , and for greater transparency in legal decisions . 
It is too soon to determine whether and how these recommendations will be incorporated into the new legal reform plan. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) The judicial system 's lack of independence and the corresponding lack of public confidence are impediments to the country 's development and reform efforts . 
Fortunately , the highest levels of the [ORG GOM  ] appear to be aware of the need for reform and have shared some of the major principles of their reform plan ( Ref B ) . 
The King first described his judicial reform plans on July 30 , 2008 ; after more than a year , details have emerged . 
The [ORG GOM  ] has also expressed a desire for [LOC U.S.  ] support in strengthening judicial competence and independence . 
The [ORG Mission  ] will continue to work with the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] as it defines its plans , in order to find areas of possible cooperation . 
Professional training of judges in both law and ethics would be one potential area for assistance . 
However , assistance will only be " window dressing " without meaningful steps by the [ORG GOM  ] to eliminate the opportunity for meddling by government officials . 
The continued use of the judiciary for political purposes undermines the [ORG GOM  ] 's otherwise laudable efforts to promote judicial reform and transparency . 
Ultimately , to reach the societal and political results that the King and [ORG GOM  ] leaders have identified as goals , they will have to give up this retrograde lever for political control . 
In meeting with the [MISC Moroccan  ] authorities , the [ORG Mission  ] will continue to press for greater judicial independence .
