( [ORG S/REL UK  ] ) [LOC WASHINGTON  ] ANALYSTS CONTINUE TO MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS IN THE OIL INDUSTRY CONCERNING POTENTIAL OFFSHORE OIL EXPLORATION AROUND THE [LOC FALKLAND ISLANDS  ] AND THE POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR [LOC ARGENTINA  ] AND THE [LOC UNITED KINGDOM  ] ( [LOC UK  ] ) . 
IN APRIL 2009 , [LOC BUENOS AIRES  ] SUBMITTED TERRITORIAL CLAIMS TO THE UNITED NATIONS COMMISSION ON THE LIMITS OF THE CONTINENTAL SHELF THAT INCLUDED THE UNDERSEA AREAS SURROUNDING THE [LOC FALKLAND ISLANDS  ] . 
IN RESPONSE , [LOC LONDON  ] , IN MAY 2009 , SUBMITTED ITS OWN CLAIMS IN THE AREA . 
IN OCTOBER 2009 , [ORG UK FIRM DESIRE PETROLEUM  ] REPORTED THAT IT SIGNED A CONTRACT WITH A [ORG U.S. FIRM  ] FOR A DRILLING RIG THAT COULD COMMENCE OPERATIONS BEGINNING IN FEBRUARY 2010. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/REL UK  ] ) ANALYSTS ARE INTERESTED IN GAUGING ARGENTINA'S POTENTIAL RESPONSE TO OIL COMPANIES BRINGING A DEEP WATER RIG FOR OIL EXPLORATION OFFSHORE OF THE [LOC FALKLAND ISLANDS  ] . 
GIVEN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN [LOC ARGENTINA  ] , IT IS POSSIBLE THAT [LOC ARGENTINA  ] MIGHT USE THE PROSPECTIVE OIL EXPLORATION IN THE REGION AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASSERT ITS CLAIMS OVER THE ISLANDS AND THE WATERS SURROUNDING IT AND USE A BELLICOSE STANCE AS A WAY TO DISTRACT THE ARGENTINE POPULACE FROM ECONOMIC PROBLEMS AT HOME . 
ANALYSTS WOULD APPRECIATE REPORTING ON THE ISSUE WHICH WOULD HELP ANALYSTS ANTICIPATE ARGENTINA'S RESPONSE TO OIL EXPLORATION OFF THE [LOC FALKLAND ISLANDS  ] , INCLUDE POSSIBLE MILITARY ACTIONS. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 .

ARE ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AWARE OF POTENTIAL OFFSHORE DRILLING , OR WILL THEY BE SURPRISED WHEN IT IS ANNOUNCED OR HAPPENS ? <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
( [ORG S/REL UK  ] ) ARE THERE DIVISIONS WITHIN THE ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT OR MILITARY LEADERSHIP ABOUT A POSSIBLE RESPONSE ? 
ARE THERE INDICATIONS THAT THIS CAN POTENTIALLY ESCALATE INTO ANOTHER MILITARY CLASH WITH THE [LOC UNITED KINGDOM  ] ? <a id='parC' href='#parC'>¶</a>C . 
( [ORG S/REL UK  ] ) WHAT DO ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS PERCEIVE TO BE THE COST OF SUPPORTING A BELLICOSE MOVE AS OPPOSED TO SIMPLY IGNORING THE EVENT ? <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) PLEASE CITE C-TN9-01234 IN THE SUBJECT LINE OF REPORTING IN RESPONSE TO THE ABOVE QUESTIONS .
