( C ) Summary . 
Director [PER Mueller: Your  ] engagement with [LOC Russia  ] 's top law enforcement and security service officials is a tangible sign that [MISC U.S.-Russian  ] relations are improving markedly after hitting bottom in the summer of 2008 . 
Recent visits by President [PER Obama  ] and Secretary [PER Clinton  ] have demonstrated to the [MISC Russians  ] that we take their concerns seriously and have produced more positive momentum in our bilateral ties than I have seen in over a decade . 
The [ORG Bilateral Presidential Commission  ] ( [ORG BPC  ] ) will play a key role in building confidence and giving us regular contact with key elements of the [PER GOR  ] bureaucracy , including the often obstructionist law-enforcement organs . 
The [ORG BPC  ] can strengthen joint efforts to combat terrorism , organized crime and other shared concerns. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Summary continued . 
You should harbor no illusions about your counterparts: FSB Director [PER Aleksandr Bortnikov  ] , SVR Director [PER Mikhail Fradkov  ] , and Internal Affairs Minister [PER Rashid Nurgaliyev  ] represent institutions that feel threatened -- ideologically and materially -- by the " reset " in our relations . 
At the same time , they appreciate the benefits that cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] provides , not only in achieving their assigned missions , but also in enhancing their country 's position internationally . 
End Summary . 
Domestic Political Context -------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) After almost two years of tandem leadership , President [PER Medvedev  ] and Prime Minister [PER Putin  ] govern based on a still-evolving division of labor . 
[PER Medvedev  ] , the junior partner , has been a steady advocate of modernization -- economic , political and technological . 
Constitutionally , he has the lead in foreign policy , but makes no major decisions without some form of consultation with [PER Putin  ] , most of which is obscure to the outside world . 
In addition to governing behind the scenes , [PER Putin  ] has been visible in tackling recent crises such as the conflict with [LOC Georgia  ] , gas supply negotiations with [LOC Ukraine  ] , and localized unrest due to the economic crisis . 
Although there is evidence that their closest advisors spar privately over policies and personnel matters , the two leaders appear united and project complete ease with one another in the media . 
[PER Medvedev  ] has yet to make major changes to the senior staff he inherited from [PER Putin  ] . 
[PER Putin  ] remains more popular than [PER Medvedev  ] . 
Three Skeptics -------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [LOC Russia  ] 's recent economic problems and uncertainty about the future of the [MISC Medvedev-Putin  ] " tandem " have reinforced long-standing elite divisions between the " siloviki " ( officials from the security and intelligence services ) and the modernizers . 
Your interlocutors are leading representatives of the siloviki ; they are [PER Putin  ] proteges who believe a strong state exercising effective political and economic control is the answer to most problems . 
They advocate tightening the screws against domestic opposition and their alleged external supporters -- principally the [LOC U.S.  ] and its [MISC Western  ] allies . 
The modernizers recognize that [LOC Russia  ] 's future depends on integration with the world economy and that confronting some of the country 's most stubborn problems -- such as corruption -- requires transparency and the impartial application of the law. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The security services are skeptical about the [LOC West  ] 's motivations and are the most influential opponents of the engagement agenda . 
[PER Bortnikov  ] , [PER Fradkov  ] , and [PER Nurgaliyev  ] tend toward a [MISC Cold War  ] mentality , which sees the [LOC U.S.  ] and its allies intent on undermining [LOC Russia  ] -- and they have made public accusations to that effect . 
None of them is within the " inner circle " of [LOC Kremlin  ] decision-making , but instead enjoy the reflected power of their sponsors and allies . 
According to one expert , [PER Fradkov  ] and [PER Bortnikov  ] share a background in dealing with economic issues -- working behind the scenes to check the influence of [LOC Russia  ] 's powerful business magnates and advance the interests of their allies . 
[PER Fradkov  ] , a former prime minister under [PER Putin  ] who allegedly worked for [MISC Soviet  ] intelligence in the 1970s in brokering arms sales to [LOC India  ] , has a mandate to protect the interests of [MISC Russian  ] companies abroad . 
[PER Fradkov  ] works closely with the powerful state corporations and has ties to the influential First Deputy Prime Minister [PER Igor Sechin  ] . 
[PER Bortnikov  ] spent his entire career in the [ORG FSB  ] working on economic issues , including a stint as head of the [ORG FSB Economic Security Service  ] . 
In that role [PER Bortnikov  ] worked on the government 's campaign against the oligarchs . 
Many consider [PER Bortnikov  ] as the protege of his predecessor , [PER Nikolay Patrushev  ] , now the Secretary of the [ORG Security Council  ] , and also indirectly allied with [PER Sechin  ] . 
Of the three , only [PER Fradkov  ] has any real experience in foreign relations gained during his tenure as [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador to the [ORG EU  ] from 2003-2004 and his work in the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Trade  ] during the 1990s. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Nevertheless , there are indications that they value work with other services on specific issues of mutual interest . 
Perhaps most telling , [PER Nurgaliyev  ] has supported cooperative relationships with his counterparts around the globe , demonstrated by his personal efforts to secure an [ORG INTERPOL  ] training center in [LOC Moscow  ] , and he has been a good partner for the [LOC U.S.  ] in its efforts to protect intellectual property rights . 
Moreover , [PER Nurgaliyev  ] has openly lamented the culture of corruption with [LOC Russia  ] 's law enforcement system and has been a strong supporter of [PER Medvedev  ] 's well-publicized campaign against corruption . 
State Security -------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Despite the changes since the collapse of the [LOC Soviet Union  ] , [LOC Russia  ] 's security services more closely resemble the model of the [PER Czarist-era Okhrana  ] ( secret police ) than [MISC Western  ] law-enforcement institutions . 
State security remains the services' primary responsibility and all three organizations devote considerable attention and resources to counter-intelligence and domestic intelligence work . 
While the [ORG FSB  ] and [ORG MVD  ] nominally share the [ORG FBI  ] 's responsibilities -- criminal prosecution , organized crime , and counter-terrorism -- they are also fully immersed in [LOC Russia  ] 's political battles . 
Political factors determine the services' enthusiasm for pursuing investigations and independent analysts believe individuals within the security services are linked with organized crime. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [MISC Russian  ] security service leaders play a far more open political role than their counterparts in the [LOC West  ] . 
Your three interlocutors accrue political power in the [MISC Russian  ] system by using the legal system against political enemies -- turning the courts into weapons of political warfare rather than independent arbiters . 
They control large numbers of men and resources -- the [ORG MVD  ] alone has more than 190,000 soldiers in its internal security divisions . 
Despite their similar outlook and background , they are often competitors for influence against each other -- with shadowy conflicts occasionally bubbling to the surface . 
Regional Unrest --------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) After the " color " revolutions in [LOC Georgia  ] and [LOC Ukraine  ] , [MISC Russian  ] security services stepped up their efforts against the [LOC U.S.  ] and other [MISC Western  ] powers , whom they blame for inciting the protests and overthrowing the governments in [LOC Tbilisi  ] and [LOC Kyiv  ] . 
Their officers maintain constant vigilance against the [LOC U.S.  ] government representatives through active surveillance and they have sought to stifle [LOC U.S.  ] humanitarian programs in the [LOC North Caucasus  ] . 
[ORG MVD  ] forces harass and intimidate political opposition protests while " investigations " against [MISC Western-supported  ] NGOs for trumped up charges ( like using pirated software ) have hindered the work that those organizations seek to accomplish. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Concern about potential social unrest associated with the recent economic crisis provided justification for the security services' push earlier this year to eliminate jury trials and to broaden the definition of " treason " to include the organization of protests against the government ; the former became a law , while [PER Medvedev  ] withdrew the treason law for revision . 
In December , the [ORG MVD  ] deployed special " OMON " forces in [LOC Vladivostok  ] against demonstrators protesting new taxes on imported automobiles , key economic sector in that region . 
They have shelved plans to reduce the number of [ORG MVD  ] internal troops , ostensibly to retain a security force for the 2014 [MISC Olympic Games  ] in [LOC Sochi.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The marked deterioration of security in the [LOC North Caucasus  ] over the past three months has alarmed regional and national leaders . 
The car bomb that nearly killed [PER Yunus-bek Yevkurov  ] , President of the [LOC Republic  ] of [LOC Ingushetia  ] , has dampened the initial optimism that [PER Yevkurov  ] could bring ethnic and religious groups together . 
The continued threat of separatism , extremism , and terrorism -- particularly in the [LOC North Caucasus  ] -- is a priority issue for the security services . 
Ethnic conflict and social unrest continue to simmer in [LOC Ingushetia  ] , [LOC Dagestan  ] , and other republics in the troubled [LOC Caucasus  ] region . 
The [ORG MVD  ] has more than 15,000 soldiers stationed in [LOC Chechnya  ] , an additional regiment in [LOC Ingushetia  ] , and has created three " special forces " ( spetznaz ) counter-terrorism units in [LOC Moscow  ] , [LOC Smolensk  ] , and [LOC Chelyabinsk  ] . 
A Challenging Relationship -------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) While portions of the [ORG FSB  ] are working cooperatively with [LOC US  ] law enforcement , some sections , particularly those dealing with counterintelligence , are not . 
Harassing activity against all embassy personnel has spiked in the past several months to a level not seen in many years . 
Embassy personnel have suffered personally slanderous and falsely prurient attacks in the media . 
Family members have been the victims of psychologically terrifying assertions that their USG employee spouses had met accidental deaths . 
Home intrusions have become far more commonplace and bold , and activity against our locally engaged [MISC Russian  ] staff continues at a record pace . 
We have no doubt that this activity originates in the [ORG FSB  ] . 
Counterintelligence challenges remain a hallmark of service at Embassy [LOC Moscow  ] . 
This fact is unlikely to change in the medium term. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Despite the challenges of working with our [MISC Russian  ] counterparts , your visit takes place in the context of strong [LOC Kremlin  ] backing and a climate of renewed opportunity . 
Since your 2004 trip to [LOC Russia  ] , the success of joint investigation programs with the [ORG MVD  ] and [ORG FSB  ] on organized crime , counter-terrorism , and cybercrime has demonstrated the potential gains that a cooperative relationship can provide . 
It is premature to say we have reached a turning point in overcoming security service suspicions about [LOC U.S.  ] intentions , but the vigor in which the [ORG FSB  ] has pursued your visit ( including covering the cost of the over flight and airport landing fees ) shows a definite thaw after last year 's war in [LOC Georgia  ] . 
At a minimum , we can expect the [MISC Russian  ] side to welcome your continued advocacy for the Joint [MISC FBI-MVD  ] working group on organized crime , efforts to work together to fight cybercrime , and other cooperative projects . 
We also expect them to be receptive to a renewed invitation for a law enforcement officer to attend the [ORG FBI  ] 's [ORG National Academy  ] at [LOC Quantico  ] .
