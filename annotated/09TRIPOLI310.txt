Cretz  ] , Ambassador . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [PER Summary: Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi 's trip to [LOC Washington  ] on April 20-24 will serve as a key metric for skeptical regime members to judge the success of [LOC Libya  ] 's ten-year re-engagement project with the [LOC West  ] and as a personal " test " for him to establish his bona fides as his brother did in [LOC Washington  ] . 
After reported turbid relations with his father , [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] , in the late 1990s , [PER Muatassim  ] returned from several years in [LOC Egypt  ] in 2006 to serve as [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG National Security Advisor  ] - a position created especially for him . 
His focus on enhancing regime security through military acquisitions and broader mandates for state security services makes him a more palatable successor to his father 's leadership for old guard [ORG Revolutionary Committee  ] members than his older brother , [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi , the apparent lead contender to succeed his father . 
[PER Muatassim  ] seeks demonstrative rewards from the [LOC U.S.  ] for [LOC Libya  ] 's decisions to give up [ORG WMD  ] programs and support for terrorism , and is keen to garner " respect " from having met with high-level [LOC U.S.  ] officials . 
His visit represents an opportunity to convey our vision for continued development in the bilateral relationship to a key insider and the potential future leader of [LOC Libya  ] . 
End Summary . 
MUATASSIM'S DOMESTIC PARAMETERS AND PROSPECTS FOR LEADERSHIP 2 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) After several years of negotiation , [LOC Libya  ] fulfilled its obligations under the [MISC Comprehensive Claims Settlement Agreement  ] - providing funds for the victims of [PER Pam Am  ] 103 and [PER LaBelle  ] bombings , among others - on October 31 , 2008 . 
The implementation of the agreement increased the level of interaction between the [ORG USG  ] and GOL - including former Secretary [PER Rice  ] 's visit to [LOC Tripoli  ] in September 2008 during which she met with [PER Muatassim  ] and his father . 
[PER Muatassim  ] 's current visit comes five months after his older brother - [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi 's - three-week trip to the [LOC U.S.  ] during the final days of the [PER Bush  ] administration . 
Despite the high-level interest in deepening the relationship , old-guard regime figures remain skeptical about the benefits of re-engagement and the more critical facets of our interaction remain at the mercy of the often mercurial inner circle . 
September 1 will be the 40th anniversary of the coup that brought [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi to power , and the two brothers are widely thought to be jostling to take on their father 's mantle . 
For his part , the Leader has made recent personnel changes that signal he may be positioning one of the sons for the succession mantle without indicating which is the clear preference . 
[MISC Western-educated  ] [PER Saif  ] al-Islam has been the public face of [LOC Libya  ] 's rapprochement with the [LOC West  ] and nascent reform movement , while [PER Muatassim  ] enjoys support from more conservative elements drawn to his efforts to bolster [LOC Libya  ] 's military and security posture . 
Both , however , appear to be supportive of normalization with the [LOC U.S.  ] SYMBOLS OF A STRONG AND LASTING PARTNERSHIP WITH THE [LOC U.S.  ] 3 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] seeks symbolic gains as much as he does substantive ones , and 2009 is full of symbolic milestones . 
In September , he will celebrate both 40 years as [LOC Libya  ] 's leader and 10 years since the [MISC Sirte Proclamation  ] - a foundational document of the [ORG African Union  ] signed in al-Qadhafi 's hometown . 
His February election to the [ORG African Union  ] chairmanship provides al-Qadhafi with a high-profile platform from which he can trumpet his vision of [LOC Africa  ] and rail against [MISC Western  ] interference on the continent and serves as confirmation of his regional importance . 
In March , [LOC Libya  ] presided over the [ORG Security Council  ] and al-Qadhafi expects to send his top [LOC Africa  ] diplomat to preside over the 64th session of the [ORG UN General Assembly  ] in the fall . 
Al-Qadhafi has played host to [PER Tony Blair  ] , [PER Vladimir Putin  ] , [PER Nicolas Sarkozy  ] , and [PER Juan Carlos  ] of [LOC Spain  ] ; but the " [ORG Holy Grail  ] " for al-Qadhafi , a meeting with the [LOC U.S.  ] President , has eluded him thus far . 
We expect [PER Muatassim  ] to forcefully promote a meeting between [ORG POTUS  ] and al-Qadhafi at this summer 's [MISC G-8  ] meeting in [LOC Italy  ] . 
Similarly , [PER Muatassim  ] may seek other symbolic " gains " to show [MISC Libyan  ] insiders that he is laying the groundwork for the future , including by advocating agreements on security and civilian nuclear cooperation in particular , as evidence that he can deliver diplomatically . 
The [MISC Libyan  ] leadership places high priority on such deliverables during their trips ; follow-up , however , is often lacking . 
[MISC European  ] and [MISC Russian  ] colleagues here have bemoaned last-minute attempts to ready agreements for signature , with one diplomat saying , " the [MISC Libyans  ] always want to sign everything but only implement what they want . 
An agreement is only valid if both sides read it the same way . 
" The bottom line for the [PER Qadhafi  ] clan is respect which they believe comes from high-level interaction and formal TRIPOLI 00000310 002.2 OF 004 agreements . 
[ORG AFRICOM  ] , SECURITY ASSURANCES , MILITARY SALES , AND TRAINING 4 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [PER Muatassim  ] 's March 10 meeting with [ORG AFRICOM Commander General Ward  ] seems to have quieted [LOC Libya  ] 's harsh rhetoric against [ORG AFRICOM  ] . 
[PER Muatassim  ] , apparently influenced by [PER Ward  ] 's presentation , encouraged the General to meet his father at the earliest opportunity . 
During this meeting [PER Muatassim  ] appeared eager to obtain security guarantees in light of [LOC Libya  ] 's decision to abandon [ORG WMD  ] . 
He told [PER Ward  ] that [LOC Libya  ] , an oil-rich country of approximately 5 million , faces the threat of " tens of millions " from [LOC Algeria  ] and [LOC Egypt  ] . 
He specifically mentioned upgrading the [MISC Mil-Mil  ] [ORG MOU  ] signed in January to a full , binding security agreement because [LOC Libya  ] - betting on [LOC US  ] support - had left itself defenseless . 
The GOL is not likely to join the [ORG Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership  ] in the near-term , but is beginning to understand that [ORG AFRICOM  ] 's mission can be congruent with [LOC Libya  ] 's national interests . 
Red lines remain , however . 
According to MFA Secretary for the [ORG Americas Ahmed Fituri  ] , who will accompany [PER Muatassim  ] on this trip , [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi expressed reservations to [PER Muatassim  ] in November 2008 that expanded military and law enforcement cooperation would lead to having large numbers of [LOC U.S.  ] advisers and trainers in [LOC Libya  ] - which would be untenable given that the " evacuation " of [LOC U.S.  ] forces in 1970 is trumpeted as a key accomplishment of the revolution . 
5 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [MISC Libyan  ] officials have been keen to purchase [LOC US  ] military equipment - both lethal and non-lethal - and to secure training for [MISC Libyan  ] military personnel . 
At [PER Muatassim  ] 's behest , [MISC Libyan  ] officials presented a " wish list " in January which included requests ranging from [MISC F-16  ] fighters to mobile field hospitals . 
Although we have yet to present the [MISC Libyans  ] with a response , the [ORG Defense Security Cooperation Agency  ] is developing Letters of Offer and Acceptance for some of the non-lethal items . 
During General [PER Ward  ] 's visit , [PER Muatassim  ] requested [MISC Libyan  ] participation in joint-training activities such as Bright [PER Star  ] in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
In response , [PER Ward  ] encouraged [PER Muatassim  ] to accept the standing invitation to send observers to the [MISC Phoenix Express  ] naval exercise which [LOC Libya  ] did less than one month later . 
Military contacts have expressed keen interest in obtaining training for their officers , but to date [LOC Libya  ] has not formally stated its requirements . 
[PER Muatassim  ] may have the influence to push the military bureaucracy to produce such a request . 
6 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [PER Muatassim  ] is likely to repeat two familiar refrains: that the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" owes " [LOC Libya  ] security cooperation ( read: sales and security guarantees ) in return for al-Qadhafi 's decision to give up his [ORG WMD  ] aspirations ; and that the [LOC U.S.  ] should return or reimburse [LOC Libya  ] for the [MISC C-130  ] transport aircraft it purchased in the 1970s . 
Ownership of the eight planes was transferred in the [LOC United States  ] , but the [ORG USG  ] did not grant an export license . 
[ORG Lockheed Martin  ] ceased maintenance of the aircraft and they have since become unserviceable . 
In effect , the [MISC Libyans  ] have made military sales and resolution of the [MISC C-130  ] issue key tests of [LOC U.S.  ] trust of and future intentions toward [LOC Libya  ] . 
LIBYA'S OUTSTANDING OBLIGATIONS ON [ORG WMD  ] DISARMAMENT 7 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [MISC Libyan  ] officials have argued since 2006 that the [MISC Libyan  ] example of [ORG WMD  ] disarmament was a poor model for the rest of the world because [LOC Libya  ] did not receive sufficient tangible " rewards " from the [LOC U.S.  ] for its 2003 decision to abandon its [ORG WMD  ] programs . 
[PER Muatassim  ] has told us that [LOC Libya  ] has been " embarrassed " when asked by [LOC North Korea  ] , [LOC Iran  ] and others what [LOC Libya  ] received for having taken such a major step . 
8 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [LOC Libya  ] is still in the process of effecting the dismantlement of its [ORG WMD  ] capacity . 
The logistics to ship 4.6kg of highly enriched uranium to [LOC Russia  ] in September 2009 have yet to be set and the conversion of the [MISC Rabta  ] chemical weapons facilities to peaceful use has suffered periodic delays . 
[LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC UK  ] members of the [ORG Tri-lateral Steering Committee  ] charged with monitoring the disarmament report that [MISC Libyan  ] progress is sporadic and that periodic unresponsiveness is often blamed on high-ranking regime members' perception that [LOC Libya  ] was not getting enough in return for its actions . 
The GOL has repeatedly called for specific , large projects that , in their view , will demonstrate to the public ( and conservative regime members ) that the decision to disarm and re-engage was the right one . 
For example , [PER Muatassim  ] has recently pressed for a civilian nuclear project , mirroring earlier calls for a power-generating TRIPOLI 00000310 003.2 OF 004 or a desalination facility built by a [LOC U.S.  ] firm . 
More conservative regime elements see the [ORG WMD  ] decision as a crucial bargaining chip too easily given away and this drives the [PER Qadhafi  ] efforts to show that the policy change toward the [LOC U.S.  ] was a beneficial one . 
If he is successful in [LOC Washington  ] , [PER Muatassim  ] can be a key messenger to them that [LOC Libya  ] will see further rewards and that further cooperation is possible . 
[ORG TRANSNATIONAL TERRORISM  ] 9 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [LOC Libya  ] is a vital partner in combating transnational terrorism . 
The regime is genuinely concerned about the rise of [MISC Islamic  ] terrorism in the [LOC Sahel  ] and [LOC Sahara  ] and worries that the instability and weak governments to their south could lead to a " belt of terrorism " stretching from [LOC Mauritania  ] to [LOC Somalia  ] . 
[LOC Libya  ] sees transnational [MISC Islamist  ] terrorist networks as dangerous threats to regime security and continuity . 
Security services actively and aggressively combat threats in their sphere and cooperate with the [ORG USG  ] and our allies through liaison channels . 
[PER Muatassim  ] is keen to receive training and , more importantly , equipment from the [LOC U.S.  ] to help [LOC Libya  ] detect and disable terrorist threats . 
10 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) The [ORG USG  ] has provided training under the [ORG State Department 's Anti-Terrorism Assistance  ] ( [ORG ATA  ] ) and [ORG Export  ] and [ORG Border Control  ] ( [ORG EXBS  ] ) rubric , and an [MISC IMET-funded English-language  ] program for [MISC Libyan  ] military members is a key entry point for further training assistance . 
After accepting [ORG ATA  ] in early 2008 , [MISC Libyan  ] security officials received the first tranche of trainers in early March , with two additional trainings scheduled for May . 
While the program is still in its infancy , thanking [PER Muatassim  ] for helping begin the program and encouraging his continued support will do much to ensure future success . 
[ORG HUMAN RIGHTS AND FATHI AL-JAHMI  ] 11 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [PER Muatassim  ] views [LOC U.S.  ] interest in the human rights situation in [LOC Libya  ] as an obstacle to further engagement on other issues . 
He complained to the Ambassador that the annual [ORG Human Rights Report  ] did not reflect the real situation in [LOC Libya  ] saying the embassy " should get rid of it " . 
He told the Ambassador he was against [ORG NGOs  ] operating in [LOC Libya  ] as they could be a destabilizing force for the regime ( Note: [ORG NGOs  ] are outlawed . 
[PER Saif  ] al-Islam , who has no official government role , chairs the largest " civil society organization " operating in [LOC Libya  ] . 
End Note . 
) and that the GOL would not countenance the " ~same situation as had been the case with [MISC Egyptian  ] [ORG NGOs  ] . 
" While he has recently told us that regime critic [PER Fathi  ] al-Jahmi will be released " this year " , his father 's direct and intimate involvement in the case will leave him little latitude to depart from his talking points: " [PER Fathi  ] al-Jahmi is a [MISC Libyan  ] citizen subject to [MISC Libyan  ] laws . 
His case is an internal matter and foreign intervention is inappropriate and unwelcome . 
" The Ambassador has repeatedly informed [PER Muatassim  ] and other senior [MISC Libyan  ] officials that his case would continue to figure large in the bilateral relationship and that it needed to be resolved quickly to prevent any damage to the furtherance of bilateral relations . 
In turn , [PER Muatassim  ] and others have argued that according the issue high-profile media coverage could set back efforts to free al-Jahmi . 
DEALING WITH [PER MUATASSIM  ] 12 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) Considered little more than a playboy just two years ago , [PER Muatassim  ] has surprised many observers by the seriousness with which he has taken his new responsibilities as the [ORG National Security Adviser  ] . 
He has , at times , overreached - notably attempting to install security chiefs without clearance from other regime elements and requesting $1.2 billion from the [ORG National Oil Corporation  ] to form his own special forces brigade . 
His mentors include members of [MISC Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi 's inner circle , notably Foreign Minister [PER Musa Kusa  ] . 
Ambitious and competitive , [PER Muatassim  ] realizes that he is being groomed as a potential successor to his father and that [PER Saif  ] al-Islam is his primary competitor . 
He has met with several senior [LOC U.S.  ] officials - including former Secretary of [ORG State Rice  ] , former [ORG NEA A/S Welch  ] , and AFRICOM Commander [PER Gen. Ward  ] . 
He does not appear to have the depth of knowledge and analytical ability commensurate with his position but at the same time , seems to be slowly growing into the job . 
[MISC Libyan  ] officials have described him as not intellectually curious , reporting that it is a struggle to get him to read custom-made abstracts on current TRIPOLI 00000310 004.2 OF 004 events , national security , and foreign affairs . 
Nevertheless , he is considered a serious contender to succeed his father and has proven he has the power to influence military and security decisions . 
13 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [PER Muatassim  ] last traveled to the [LOC U.S.  ] shortly after being named [ORG National Security Advisor  ] for the fall 2007 session of the [ORG UN General Assembly  ] . 
At that time , he was closely advised by [PER Musa Kusa  ] who accompanied him to [LOC New York  ] . 
Notably , his current delegation seems to lack a similar minder - perhaps a sign of his growing independence and stature . 
He speaks enough [MISC English  ] to conduct basic meetings , but lacks the fluency to discuss complex issues . 
14 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [ORG Comment:  ] The visit offers an opportunity to meet a power player and potential future leader of [LOC Libya  ] . 
We should also view the visit as an opportunity to draw out [PER Muatassim  ] on how the [MISC Libyans  ] view " normalized relations " with the [LOC U.S.  ] and , in turn , to convey how we view the future of the relationship as well . 
Given his role overseeing [LOC Libya  ] 's national security apparatus , we also want his support on key security and military engagement that serves our interests . 
End comment .
