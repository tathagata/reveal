( [ORG U  ] ) The [MISC Icelandic  ] Prime Minister , Foreign Minister and visiting [ORG IMF  ] team held consecutive press conferences on October 24 to announce an agreement on an [ORG IMF  ] package encompassing a roughly $2 billion [ORG IMF  ] loan to [LOC Iceland.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Prime Minister [PER Haarde  ] and Foreign Minister [PER Gisladottir  ] announced that the [ORG Icelandic Government  ] had approved a decision to formally request [ORG IMF  ] assistance , and the opposition political parties had been briefed on this . 
[LOC Iceland  ] will take a 2 billion USD loan from the [ORG IMF  ] to be paid back between 2012 and 2015 . 
The hope is that the [ORG IMF  ] package will help open other lines of credit to meet the immediate goal of 6 billion USD . 
They said that the [MISC Russian  ] loan is still a possibility in this framework , but the amount will likely be lower than the 4 billion [MISC Euro initially  ] discussed . 
There are no current plans to raise taxes to meet the debt , but this can't be ruled out . 
[PER Haarde  ] said he expected the next six months to be " very difficult . 
" [LOC Iceland  ] views the dispute with the [LOC UK  ] government and the [ORG IMF  ] package as two separate issues . 
This loan will not be used to pay off debts of the collapsed banks -- the government will not take public debt to meet private obligations . 
The PM noted that he alone has power to appoint and fire [ORG Central Bank Governors  ] and that he has no plans to make changes to the board at present. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG IMF Delegation  ] led by [PER Paul Thomassen  ] announced that the hope that the [ORG IMF Board  ] will approve the 2 billion USD loan package within the next ten days , which would make 800 million USD available immediately . 
This infusion of cash will allow [LOC Iceland  ] to start foreign trading of the [LOC Krona  ] again , and hopefully mitigate a " flight of capital " and a sharp depreciation of the [LOC Krona  ] . 
The [ORG IMF  ] expects a recession next year of approximately ten percent of [LOC Iceland  ] 's GDP , but admitted this is a very uncertain figure . 
Inflation will spike at first , but should drop to 4.5 percent by end of 2009 . 
The [MISC Iceland-UK  ] agreement on IceSave deposits was not a prerequisite for the [ORG IMF  ] package , but ongoing talks between [MISC Iceland-UK  ] and [MISC Iceland-Holland  ] on bank deposits are part of approach that [ORG IMF  ] expects to GOI to follow to ensure long term financial stability. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 .
