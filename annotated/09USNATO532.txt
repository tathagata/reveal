END SUMMARY Contingency Planning -------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Jukneviciene  ] underscored the importance of contingency planning for [LOC Lithuania  ] , adding that it was a [MISC Lithuanian  ] Presidential priority for discussions with [LOC Washington  ] . 
She said that [LOC Lithuania  ] 's focus was on attaining an outcome ( a plan or , at a minimum , a timeline ) and not on the process or " going public " about the issue . 
She said that [LOC Lithuania  ] was aware of the potential to expand EAGLE GUARDIAN , the plan for the defense of [LOC Poland  ] , to include defense of the Baltics , adding that [LOC Vilnius  ] would be satisfied with that approach. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Jukneviciene  ] said that she had heard that [ORG NATO  ] Secretary General [PER Rasmussen  ] has expressed concerns about the potential impact of such planning on [ORG NATO  ] engagement with [LOC Russia  ] to former [LOC U.S.  ] Secretary of State [PER Albright  ] , who now chairs the Secretary General 's Group of Experts advising him on the revision of [ORG NATO  ] 's [ORG Strategic Concept  ] . 
She said she had also heard that the [ORG EU  ] 's [PER Javier Solana  ] had expressed the same opinion at a conference in [LOC Washington  ] . 
[PER Jukneviciene  ] contrasted these alleged remarks with the actions of [LOC Russia  ] during the [MISC Russian-Belarussian  ] [ORG ZAPAD  ] 2009 military exercise , arguing that [LOC Moscow  ] was clearly not concerned about damaging relations with [ORG NATO  ] or [LOC Russia  ] 's neighbors . 
She cited the tepid response of some Allies to [ORG ZAPAD  ] 2009 as an example of the " [MISC Russian  ] influence " on Alliance security issues . 
[PER Daalder  ] Responds ---------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Daalder  ] responded by noting strong [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to [ORG NATO  ] Article 5 commitments , as demonstrated by its decision on Missile Defense , while noting that [LOC Washington  ] was still studying the issue of contingency planning . 
He also urged [LOC Lithuania  ] not to engage in a public debate on contingency planning ; something which he said would only prove harmful to the [MISC Lithuanian  ] cause . 
He stressed that this issue should be discussed confidentially within [ORG NATO  ] .
