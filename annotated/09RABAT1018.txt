RABAT 0988 RABAT 00001018 001.2 OF 002 Classified By: DCM [PER Robert P. Jackson  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Summary: XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [LOC PolOffs  ] on December 30 that despite [PER Dadis Camara  ] 's apparent desire to depart [LOC Morocco  ] ( Ref A ) , he is in no condition to travel and will not be able to resume control of the country . 
Minister of [ORG National Defense Sekouba Konate  ] and an assistant , [PER Mr. Bah  ] , along with Minister of Communications [PER Idrissa Cherif  ] have been in [LOC Rabat  ] to visit [PER Dadis  ] , but [PER Konate  ] planned to return to [LOC Guinea  ] by December 31 , possibly to present to the [MISC Guinean  ] people a case for his assumption of power in place of [PER Dadis  ] . 
The next ten days would be telling and potentially chaotic for the country , according to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , but with the assistance of the international community , [PER Konate  ] should be able to control the army and avert violence that could have regional implications . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [LOC PolOffs  ] on December 30 that [PER Dadis Camara  ] was in no condition to travel and would not be able to control [LOC Guinea  ] again . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that [PER Dadis Camara  ] still had a bullet in his head , suffered from impaired vision and speech , and was not fully aware of his surroundings . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] admitted that he had not seen [PER Dadis  ] ; according to him only [PER Konate  ] and [PER Bah  ] were allowed into his room . 
Regarding earlier news reports that [PER Dadis  ] was preparing to speak to the [MISC Guinean  ] people , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that if [PER Dadis  ] could speak to the media , he certainly would have by now . 
Evidently [PER Dadis  ] also suffered from heart problems unrelated to the gunshot wounds. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Konate  ] evidently was not in the best of health , either , and sought medical consultation while here in [LOC Rabat  ] . 
Reportedly a heavy drinker , [PER Konate  ] suffered from liver problems consistent with his intake of large amounts of alcohol . 
On December 30 , senior [MISC Moroccan  ] military officials separately questioned [PER Konate  ] 's fitness to lead , calling him weak. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) For [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [PER Konate  ] 's travel to [LOC Rabat  ] allowed him to return to [LOC Guinea  ] and report on the basis of his first-hand knowledge that [PER Dadis  ] was unable to continue in his role as leader of [LOC Guinea  ] , paving the way for [PER Konate  ] to assume power for a transitional period . 
Were [PER Konate  ] to attempt to take control without having undertaken the trip to [LOC Rabat  ] to see [PER Dadis  ] , he would have been perceived as a traitor to [PER Dadis  ] and have no legitimacy before the [MISC Guinean  ] people and army . 
[PER Konate  ] would then have [PER Cherif  ] and [PER Claude Pivi  ] , another [MISC CNDD  ] leader , arrested , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] went on to say that [PER Cherif  ] was behind demonstrations being planned for [LOC Conakry  ] , while [PER Pivi  ] , who was from the same ethnic group as [PER Dadis  ] , might organize supporters on an ethnic basis and incite clashes with other groups . 
Given that ethnic and national boundaries are not coterminous , this could affect neighboring countries and plunge the entire region into chaos ( Ref B ) , asserted [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
With the help of the [LOC United States  ] and [MISC European  ] countries , [PER Konate  ] would be able to take power and control the army , which lacked discipline and had too many crooks and militias , but [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] did not specify what sort of assistance from the international community would be necessary. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Comment: [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] urged intervention , both to keep [PER Dadis  ] out of [LOC Guinea  ] and to support an effort by [PER Konate  ] to take power in the country , in order to forestall devastating ethnic violence . 
His argument that [PER Dadis  ] would RABAT 00001018 002.2 OF 002 have made a public statement by now if he could have is compelling , while his comment that [PER Konate  ] would have other [MISC CNDD  ] leaders arrested suggests that the fate of [LOC Guinea  ] does not depend on [PER Dadis  ] alone . 
[PER Dadis  ] has amassed militias and enjoys some popular support ( Ref B ) , and for [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] his return would undoubtedly lead to violence and unrest . 
His continued absence , however , might not preclude it .
