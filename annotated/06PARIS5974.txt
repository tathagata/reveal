( C ) Eight months before [LOC France  ] 's 2007 Presidential election , Interior Minister [PER Nicholas Sarkozy  ] remains the best positioned of the many contenders for [LOC France  ] 's presidency . 
He is a markedly different presidential heavyweight , pro-American and committed to free-market principles . 
Notwithstanding his evident strengths and popularity , many [MISC French  ] voters are still uncomfortable with the idea of " President [PER Sarkozy  ] , " and questions about his hyperactive personality , his core law-and-order agenda , and divisions within the ruling [ORG UMP  ] make his election far from certain . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] 's Gaullist political heritage and his likely " I can speak frankly to the [MISC Americans  ] " refrain mean that [LOC France  ] and [PER Sarkozy  ] would remain an independent and challenging ally . 
However , a [PER Sarkozy  ] presidency would certainly bring a new and welcome tone to [MISC U.S.-French  ] relations -- and perhaps , over time , a [MISC French  ] approach to world problems that is less fixated on reflexively seeking ways to distinguish [LOC France  ] from the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Sarkozy  ] 's greatest contribution to [LOC France  ] could be his promise to free the country 's latent economic dynamism from the constraints of statism and labor rigidity . 
End Summary . 
Timeline to the Election ------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Eight months ahead of the first round of [LOC France  ] 's 2007 presidential election , to be held on either Sunday , April 15 or Sunday , April 22 , 2007 , Interior Minister and President of the center-right [ORG Union  ] for a [ORG Popular Movement  ] party ( [ORG UMP  ] ) [PER Nicolas Sarkozy  ] remains the best positioned of the many contenders . 
In the last presidential election in 2002 , there were 16 candidates in the first round . 
Slightly fewer are expected this time around . 
The second round run-off between the top two vote-getters of the first round will be held two weeks later , either Sunday , April 29 or Sunday , May 6 . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] has served as Interior Minister in the government of Prime Minister [PER Dominique de Villepin  ] since that government 's inception in June 2005 . 
In January 2007 ( tentatively scheduled for January 14-15 ) the [ORG UMP  ] will hold a party congress expected to designate [PER Sarkozy  ] , the party leader , as its presidential candidate . 
Shortly before that congress , [PER Sarkozy  ] may well leave the government to dedicate himself full-time to pursuing the presidency . 
In recent weeks [PER Sarkozy  ] has been careful to signal that he is keeping all his options open in this connection , pointing out that nothing prevents him from remaining in the government while he pursues the presidency . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] himself will make the final decision -- and will not hesitate to ignore the advice of others -- as he did when he chose to rejoin the government in June 2005 . 
The [ORG Best Positioned Contender  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Ever since his first tenure as interior minister ( 2002 - 2004 ) , when he emerged as a top-tier national political figure , [PER Sarkozy  ] has been highly popular with a large segment of the [MISC French  ] electorate . 
The most recent polling figures show that popularity holding steady . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] 's unchallenged control of the [ORG Union  ] for a [ORG Popular Movement  ] ( [ORG UMP  ] ) party ( which was founded by President [ORG Chirac  ] ) also increases his election chances . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] has worked to turn the [ORG UMP  ] into a formidable electoral machine , complete with focus groups for keeping his message tuned to voters' concerns and volunteer organizations for turning out the [MISC Sarkozy-for-president  ] vote . 
Since he became president of the party in 2004 , [PER Sarkozy  ] has also increased the number of party members from 100,000 to 250,000 today . 
This political organization gives [PER Sarkozy  ] a powerful advantage , and should ensure his presence in the second round of the election . 
Moreover , [PER Sarkozy  ] is a formidable campaigner , energetic , quick on his feet and appealingly direct . 
The combination of popularity , control of his party , and masterful political skills , including as a campaigner , is unmatched by any of the other presidential contenders . 
A Different Kind of Presidential Heavyweight -------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Sarkozy  ] is hard to pigeon-hole ; he is not a traditional [MISC French  ] conservative , which is clear from some of his policy proposals . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] often speaks of the need for [LOC France  ] to break with policies and attitudes that undercut the [LOC PARIS  ] 00005974 002.2 OF 004 country 's economic dynamism . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] has long called for lower taxes and more " liberal " ( i.e. , free-market ) economic policies to encourage entrepreneurship . 
He has also long called for a less regulated environment for big business , something of a novelty in a country in which both left and right have always been comfortable with a high level of government regulation of the economy . 
The untested popularity of [PER Sarkozy  ] 's free-market orientation helps explain why few commentators at this stage are ready to hazard a firm prediction on the outcome of the 2007 election other than to affirm that -- presuming candidates of the center-left and of the center-right compete in the second round -- it will be exceedingly close ; [PER Sarkozy  ] himself has indicated to us on a numerous occasions that the election will be " 51 - 49 . 
" [PER Sarkozy  ] is well aware of the resistance in [LOC France  ] to shrinking the role of the state in protecting the economic security of both individuals and businesses. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Sarkozy  ] 's proposals in the field of social policy -- for example , affirmative action in employment and education for immigrants who are discriminated against , and limited voting rights for non-citizen residents -- are not policies traditionally associated with the right of the political spectrum in [LOC France  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] 's proposals for reforming [MISC French  ] government institutions -- making the president answerable to the legislature and responsible for the domestic policies of the government , while giving the legislature more oversight over [LOC France  ] 's foreign policy -- also break the mold of traditional , center-right [MISC French  ] Gaullism . 
Most of all , [PER Sarkozy  ] is associated with tough , firm enforcement of anti-crime and counter-terrorism measures . 
Doubts about a " President [PER Sarkozy  ] " ---------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Sarkozy  ] is also perceived as a different kind of political personality . 
Recent polls point to the austere [PER De Gaulle  ] and the imperturbable [ORG Mitterrand  ] as by far the most revered of [MISC French  ] presidents . 
That the edgy , intense , hands-on [PER Sarkozy  ] is so far from the preferred model of [MISC Olympian  ] reserve raises the question of whether , as a matter of cultural psychology , the [MISC French  ] are ready to entrust the presidency to [PER Sarkozy  ] . 
Clearly many [MISC French  ] people recognize that a " new model " is needed -- a presidency that directs and is responsible for domestic policy , especially given the new , shorter five-year presidential term . 
The iconoclastic [PER Sarkozy  ] has the most extensive experience and strongest credentials for filling that role . 
The [MISC French  ] however , are also famously hesitant to embrace change , and in a time of apprehension and self-doubt could prefer a more traditional and reassuring figure . 
Some also fear a [PER Sarkozy  ] presidency , citing his " hyper-active " personality , and persisting factional splits within his own party , and his polarizing image as a law-and-order strongman . 
Electorally , [PER Sarkozy  ] 's law-and-order image is potentially the most significant . 
It is this hard-edged profile that makes [PER Sarkozy  ] a divisive more than unifying figure , generating intense allegiance on the right and , equally strongly , unsettling so many on the left and even the center of the political spectrum . 
Pro-American at Heart , but Still a [MISC French  ] Gaullist --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Sarkozy  ] -- for a [MISC French  ] politician -- is forceful and unabashed about the need for [LOC France  ] to get beyond its anti-American reflexes . 
With the exception of his reservations about the wisdom of the [LOC U.S.  ] invasion of [LOC Iraq  ] in 2003 , [PER Sarkozy  ] is the [MISC French  ] political leader most supportive of the [LOC U.S.  ] role in the world . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] has told the Ambassador on several occasions that [LOC France  ] needs to help the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" get out of [LOC Iraq  ] . 
" [PER Sarkozy  ] 's pro-American orientation has earned him the sobriquet " [PER Sarkozy  ] the [MISC American  ] , " and his affinity for [MISC Americans  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] is genuine and heartfelt . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] 's admiration for the [LOC U.S.  ] comes through in one of his favorite stories: when , as a young boy , he told father that he wanted to be president , his father told him , " In that case , with a name like [PER Sarkozy  ] , you 'd better immigrate to [LOC America  ] . 
" The young [PER Nicolas  ] replied that he wanted to become President of [LOC France  ] , not the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Sarkozy  ] has always wanted to make [LOC France  ] a land of equal opportunity for immigrants also. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Sarkozy  ] 's pro-Americanism , however , should not be interpreted as meaning that Gaullist insistence on [LOC France  ] 's ( and the [ORG EU  ] 's ) independence from the [LOC U.S.  ] in the international arena will disappear . 
[LOC France  ] 's selective [LOC PARIS  ] 00005974 003 OF 004 support for [LOC U.S.  ] positions will continue . 
Nor will [PER Sarkozy  ] likely abandon [LOC France  ] 's traditional preference for strengthening the [ORG EU  ] over [ORG NATO  ] in the name of trans-Atlantic rapprochement . 
As [PER Sarkozy  ] told a visiting [ORG Congressional  ] delegation last year , " We should never forget that we are loyal friends -- and that friends can disagree . 
" Although [PER Sarkozy  ] feels close to [LOC America  ] ( to this day , he recalls with fondness his " discovery " of [LOC America  ] as an [ORG International Visitors Program  ] grantee in 1985 ) , his assertive personality is such that , as [LOC France  ] 's president , he would not shy away from offering firm advice about how the [LOC U.S.  ] might best advance towards shared goals -- up to and including bald advice to change course . 
Even so , what [PER Sarkozy  ] would call the " loyalty " factor in his friendship toward the [LOC U.S.  ] would remain intact , and [PER Sarkozy  ] 's articulate , public defense of that attitude could , over time , result in a greater [MISC French  ] receptivity to [LOC America  ] 's global outlook and policy positions . 
Especially if extended over a two-term , ten-year Presidency , the result could be a [LOC France  ] less resentful of the [LOC U.S.  ] -- one less reflexively inclined to taking positions that intensify and highlight [LOC France  ] 's differences with the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Sarkozy  ] 's Free-Market Convictions Could Transform [LOC France  ] --------------------------------------------- ----------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Sarkozy  ] 's greatest contribution to [LOC France  ] could be in freeing the country 's latent economic dynamism from the constraints of statism and labor rigidity . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] has , since the beginning of his long career in politics , been among the most outspokenly " liberal " ( that is , pro-free-market ) of [MISC French  ] political leaders . 
His speeches on economic and social issues nearly invariably include paeans to commerce , hard work , and entrepreneurship , followed by an exhortation to [MISC Frenchmen  ] and women to be proud of these qualities . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] would like to make the [MISC French  ] more " liberal " than they are , and believes economic forces acting on [LOC France  ] justify his endeavor . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] often underlines the inescapability of the global market and exhorts the [MISC French  ] to accept the challenges of competing in it with greater self-confidence . 
He is adept at depicting , in ways that ordinary voters understand , the drag on opportunity and growth of a bloated state intent on monitoring nearly every aspect of economic life. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) At the same time , [PER Sarkozy  ] understands that the [MISC French  ] want to be protected and that they are comfortable with a high degree of state involvement in the economy . 
The current controversy over the privatization and merger involving the national gas company ( [ORG GDF  ] ) and a the energy giant [ORG Suez  ] exemplifies the persisting sensitivity of loosening state control over the economy in [LOC France  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] 's record -- he is above all a pragmatic politician -- as a " liberalizing " policy practitioner is quite mixed . 
For example , during his tenure as Finance Minister ( March-November 2004 ) , when confronted by labor union resistance to significant privatization of state utilities , [PER Sarkozy  ] compromised . 
He worked hard -- and offered government assistance -- to keep factories threatened with closure operating in [LOC France  ] . 
Spurred by public complaints about rising prices in supermarkets , he negotiated " voluntary " price controls with major chains . 
He practiced " patriotic liberalism " in helping engineer the merger of a large [MISC French  ] pharmaceutical company ( [ORG Aventis  ] ) with a larger [MISC French  ] pharmaceutical firm ( [ORG Sanofi  ] ) rather than with [ORG Sanofi  ] 's foreign rival ( the [MISC Swiss  ] firm , [ORG Novartis  ] ) . 
By and large , the public approved [PER Sarkozy  ] 's protectionist actions. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) It remains to be seen whether economic reform will be a decisive issue in the upcoming presidential campaign . 
( Comment: If the current trend of economic growth and reduced unemployment continues , this is less likely to be the case . 
End Comment . 
) If it does emerge as the key campaign issue , and if a victorious [PER Sarkozy  ] moves early and aggressively to effect reform , then he could push the [MISC French  ] past the tipping point and into a far-reaching and necessary restructuring of the [MISC French  ] social model . 
An ambitious [PER Sarkozy  ] reform program would likely include , for example , measures to further loosen the currently mandated 35-hour workweek , measures to reduce wealth and inheritance taxes to encourage long-term investment in family firms , measures to restructure unemployment and welfare benefits so they act as incentives to find work quickly , and measures to reform the university system so it provides students with the skills the job market requires from them . 
The result could be a society in which entrepreneurship , self-reliance and optimism would be more [LOC PARIS  ] 00005974 004 OF 004 highly valued , and in which competition could co-exist with the cherished notion of " equality . 
" Such changes could release the latent economic creativity and dynamism of the [MISC French  ] , who , by and large , are highly skilled and hard-working . 
But it will be a tall order. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) In [PER Sarkozy  ] , who harbors a more [MISC America-like  ] vision for [LOC France  ] , the moment might well meet the man , ushering in an era of higher economic growth and innovation in [LOC France  ] . 
Such an economically re-vitalized [LOC France  ] would cohere neatly with [PER Sarkozy  ] 's fundamentally Gaullist principles: renewed economic vitality would bolster both [LOC France  ] 's ambitions to lead in [LOC Europe  ] and to play a major role in international affairs .
