( S/NF ) Introduction and [MISC Summary: The Garcia Administration  ] 's efforts to combat narcotrafficking have been stronger than under past administrations , and have included a [ORG National Anti-Drug Strategy  ] partly supported with government funds , solid progress combatting coca production in the [LOC Upper Huallaga Valley  ] , and better police cooperation . 
And while corruption has long plagued [MISC Peruvian  ] government institutions , few observers believe the problem today is anywhere near as deep or extensive as during the shadowy ( 1990-2000 ) reign of former President [PER Fujimori  ] 's intelligence chief [PER Vladimiro Montesinos  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] as claimed to Poloffs that remnants of the [PER Montesinos  ] narco-corruption web still exist within the military . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] argues that some senior military officials receive lucrative payoffs from drug traffickers operating in the [LOC Apurimac  ] and [LOC Ene River Valley  ] ( [ORG VRAE  ] ) , which is also the base of one of the most important remnants of the [ORG Shining Path  ] guerrillas . 
He contends that the army -- for fear of disrupting these drug trafficking networks and losing access to payoffs -- is unwilling to commit the large force needed to pacify the [ORG VRAE  ] . 
As a result , he argues , ongoing military operations against the [ORG Shining Path  ] are destined to fall short . 
Some of [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ' accusations are corroborated by other Embassy contacts , press reports , and internal documents as well as circumstantial evidence . 
Although [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] clearly has an axe to grind against some of his colleagues , the evidence calls for close monitoring . 
In the meantime , it is apparent that Defense Minister [PER Antero Flores Araoz  ] is continuing to push the military to build on and expand new counter-terrorism efforts in the [ORG VRAE  ] . 
( Note: This cable focuses on military , rather than police corruption because the military retains principal authority in the [ORG VRAE  ] .

Army [ORG Command Dismantles Military Operations  ] in the [ORG VRAE  ] ( 2004 ) --------------------------------------------- ------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S/NF ) Corruption has long plagued [MISC Peruvian  ] government institutions , including the security services -- military , police and judicial . 
Former President [PER Alberto Fujimori  ] 's ( 1990-2000 ) intelligence chief [PER Vladimiro Montesinos  ] , for example , collaborated with top army and other security officials to develop a web of protection for favored drug traffickers while cooperating with [LOC U.S.  ] officials to combat others . 
To many observers , that was [LOC Peru  ] 's " heyday " of narco-corruption -- a time when the government of [LOC Peru  ] verged on becoming a kind of " narco-state " in which those who controlled the main criminal trafficking networks were in fact high government officials . 
While most observers acknowledge that [LOC Peru  ] has come a long way since that time , sharply reducing the extent of such subterranean influences , few believe that drug-related corruption has been eliminated and some believe it may now again be on the rise . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] for one , argues that significan elements of this corrupt network continue to exist and t operate -- now under the control of second-tier officers from the [PER Montesinos  ] period. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S/NF ) Many of [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] principle accusations stem from corruption he says he witnessed while serving in 2004 as Army Commander in [LOC Ayacucho  ] ( which includes part of the [ORG VRAE  ] ) . 
At that time , he said , he launched a counter insurgency operation that he claimed some senior army officers later dismantled when it threatened their own corrupt interests . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that when he first took command in [LOC Ayacucho  ] , his military aide offered him an expensive vehicle as a gift from local drug traffickers . 
He said he refused the bribe and instead used a small salary increase approved by then-President [PER Alejandro Toledo  ] to recruit auxiliary troops from local self-defense groups in the [ORG VRAE  ] to build his forces from 300 to 3,500 troops . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] deployed these troops to small bases of about 100 soldiers each , spread throughout the [ORG VRAE  ] in [LOC Ayacucho  ] . 
He told [PER Poloff  ] he believed that such bases would be better positioned to resist insurgents and drug traffickers than the isolated outposts of five to seven soldiers -- the model in use at the time -- who regularly accepted bribes rather than risk confronting superior forces . 
( A variety of articles and investigative news programs from 2004 confirmed this description of [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] strategy , characterizing it as both effective and economical . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S/NF ) After five months on the job , however , the army high command removed [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and replaced him with [PER Edwin Donayre  ] ( the recently retired commander of the Army ) , who dismantled [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] operation and reduced troop levels to 700 . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] claimed he was fired because his operation threatened lucrative sales of excess fuel by senior army officers to drug traffickers . 
He said he had received prior warning about the practice from the counter-drug police [ORG DIRANDRO  ] and used his command to aggressively combat the sales . 
When asked if another part of the [MISC GOP  ] could have demanded his removal , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that it had to be a military decision because he had coordinated his mission with both President [PER Toledo  ] and [ORG Congress  ] , where his father-in-law headed the [ORG Defense Commission  ] . 
( Note: [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] himself was accused of corruption and dismissed from the military after being removed from his post in [LOC Ayacucho  ] . 
The charges were dismissed after six months , however , and he was reinstated .

) Excess Fuel Scandal Implicates Top Generals ( 2006 ) --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S/NF ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] contends that the excess military fuel scandal that erupted in 2006 is linked to the army 's drug trafficking ties in the [ORG VRAE  ] . 
The scandal broke when the press denounced a scheme by some senior generals to request hundreds of thousands of gallons of fuel in 2006 for sale and personal enrichment . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that about half this fuel was sold to companies like [ORG Repsol  ] , while the rest in the form of kerosene , was sold to drug traffickers in the [ORG VRAE  ] . 
One prominent counter-narcotics analyst told [PER Poloff  ] he had seen evidence that the military had sold kerosene to drug traffickers in northern [LOC Peru  ] , and – although he did not have evidence -- believed it plausible they have also sold to traffickers in the [ORG VRAE  ] . 
Prosecutors have since implicated dozens of Generals in the scheme to commercialized fuel , including then Army commander [PER Cesar Reinoso  ] -- who was forced to resign -- and his replacement [PER Edwin Donayre  ] . 
[PER Reinoso  ] later claimed that the scheme was nothing new and that nearly all senior generals participated . 
( Note: Officers are officially provided periodic fuel allotments , usually more than can be reasonably consumed , and consider this a perquisite that complements their base salary . 
End Note . 
) Army Commanding General [PER Donayre  ] retired from the military on December 5 -- putatively for his politically inflammatory comments relating to [LOC Chile  ] ( Ref A ) -- but in the view of some observers for other reasons as well , including his alleged involvement in the fuel skimming scheme . 
( Comment: This is probably the weakest link in [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] argument . 
Although the fuel theft is real , we have so far found no other source to confirm that the military is selling kerosene in bulk to narcotraffickers . 
End Comment . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S/NF ) [LOC Peru  ] 's [ORG Public Ministry  ] is currently investigating the fuel scandal , so far without results . 
In a series of recent articles published in the political weekly " Caretas , " prominent investigative journalist [PER Gustavo Gorriti  ] has alleged an army cover-up . 
[PER Gorriti  ] reported that General [PER Donayre  ] declined to meet [ORG Public Ministry  ] investigators on six separate occasions , and that he reassigned the army 's internal inspector to a remote jungle posting after the inspector issued a damning report on the scandal . 
[PER Gorriti  ] also reported that the [MISC GOP  ] 's independent Comptroller in 2008 completed an investigation that said the military used clumsy counterfeit documentation to " justify " over $2 million in excess fuel . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [ORG Poloffs  ] that the army is withholding internal accounting documents that would help prove the investigators case . 
He gave [PER Poloff  ] what he said were copies of these documents , marked " Secret " , that showed hundreds of thousands of gallons of " extraordinary fuel " allotments to various generals in 2004 and 2005 . 
Cocaine Exported [ORG Via Army Base  ] in [LOC Northern Peru  ] ( 2004 ) --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S/NF ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [PER Poloff  ] he believed a drug trafficking operation uncovered by police in 2004 at an army base in [LOC Piura  ] in northern [LOC Peru  ] was also linked to some senior military officials and drugs exiting the [ORG VRAE  ] . 
According to a series of investigative reports by a prominent newspaper , a junior officer gave traffickers linked to a [MISC Mexican  ] cartel free rein to use the base and its military vehicles to transit cocaine shipments to a military port where the navy ran a fish-packing operation . 
At the port , the traffickers packed the drugs in with the fish for export . 
In the 2004 bust , police captured 700 kg of cocaine . 
The commander of the base at the time , General [PER Williams Zapata  ] -- now [LOC Peru  ] 's representative at the [ORG Inter-American Defense Board  ] in [LOC Washington  ] -- refused to comment beyond claiming that the military was not involved with drug trafficking . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] however , told [PER Poloff  ] that the implicated junior officer as well as another perpetrator privately alleged that both General [PER Zapata  ] and another unnamed senior general had participated in the drug operation . 
( Note: Currently , the junior officer is detained in [LOC Brazil  ] , awaiting possible extradition , and the other offender is in prison in [LOC Piura  ] awaiting trial . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S/NF ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] officers may have continued to cooperate with drug traffickers . 
His main suspicion surrounded a visit [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] by the Director of the [ORG National Chamber of Fishing of Piura  ] , [PER Rolando Eugenio Velasco Heysen  ] , to meet regional Army commander General [PER Paul da Silva  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] peculated that [PER Da Silva  ] and [PER Velasco  ] -- who was arrested in October 2007 for attempting to export 840 kilograms of cocaine hidden in frozen fish -- were coordinating drug shipments . 
An investigative journalist later reported that both [PER Da Silva  ] and General [PER Edwin Donayre  ] had met with [PER Velasco  ] , but that [PER Velasco  ] claimed he was merely promoting the consumption of high-protein squid by the army . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] claims this argument makes no sense because the [MISC Generals'  ] meetings with [PER Velasco  ] occurred outside the time of year that the Army signs new contracts . 
Counter-Drug Analysts on Possible Narco-Army Links --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S/NF ) A prominent [MISC Peruvian  ] counter-drug analyst who travels regularly to the [ORG VRAE  ] agreed with the assessment that some senior army commanders were complicit with drug trafficking . 
He further believed the military was beginning to recuperate the political power that it had in the 1990s under President [PER Alberto Fujimori  ] 's spy chief [PER Vladimiro Montesinos  ] , when senior military officers worked surreptitiously and closely with ( certain ) drug traffickers . 
This analyst said that on his last trip to the [ORG VRAE  ] , a local mayor told him the military controlled all the main riverine drug routes , and that officers charged protection money rather than staunch the flow . 
A second analyst who travels regularly to the [ORG VRAE  ] said he had clear evidence that the military controlled at least one major drug route ( through [MISC Cayramayo  ] ) and charged bribes from passing drug traffickers. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S/NF ) The analysts also highlighted the case of a drug plane that crashed in October 2007 while trying to take off from a clandestine airstrip in [ORG VRAE  ] . 
According to a report in the left-of-center newspaper [ORG La Republica  ] , the airstrip was located in direct view of a military base . 
The paper 's local sources said that no plane could take off or land without being spotted from the base . 
The first analyst said his sources in the area told him the army had actually built the airstrip . 
According to a [ORG DAO  ] source , after the plane crashed , an army unit sought to destroy any evidence by cutting up the wreckage and dumping it in the river ( Ref B ) . 
The national police received a tip about the army 's actions and recovered the plane , but did not report the incident in order to avoid inflaming already tense relations with the military . 
Army sources told [ORG La Republica  ] , however , that the plane was the first they had ever discovered in the area and that they immediately reported it to the police . 
Implications for [ORG Military Operations  ] in the [ORG VRAE  ] --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S/NF ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and several analysts argued that the military are reluctant to implement a serious plan to pacify the [ORG VRAE  ] because the payoffs from drug traffickers are too profitable . 
These contacts dismissed the recent [MISC Operation Excellence  ] in [MISC Vizcatan  ] ( Ref C and Septel ) as too small to have any real impact in such a larg and harsh terrain . 
The operation may temporarily displace [ORG Shining Path  ] cells , they said , but it will not deter drug traffickers . 
One analyst described the operation as a smokescreen designed to deflect increasing political pressure on the army to show results . 
Another analyst argued that the operation appeared to be a serious effort to decapitate [ORG Shining Path  ] while at the same time avoiding the disruption of profitable drug trafficking routes . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] Comment: A Series of [ORG Worrying Indicators  ] ---------------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( S/NF ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] clearly has an axe to grind , and we do not have enough evidence to prove that all his allegations are true . 
However , the limited and tentative progress by the military in the [ORG VRAE  ] to date does give some plausibility to his argument that the some army officials may not support the larger objectives of the ongoing operations in the [ORG VRAE  ] . 
We will continue to closely monitor evidence of drug corruption in the military and to encourage the government to consolidate and expand on the first steps taken during [MISC Operation Excellence  ] .
