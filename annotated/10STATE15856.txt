( U ) This is an action request to Embassy [LOC Ankara  ] . 
Please see paragraph 7. ---------- BACKGROUND ---------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [LOC U.S.  ] has information about several transactions involving [MISC Turkish  ] firms planning to export and import from [LOC Iran  ] arms and related material controlled by the [ORG Wassenaar Arrangement  ] . 
Specifically , [LOC Iran  ] is interested in procuring [MISC Full Metal Jacket  ] ( [ORG FMJ  ] ) .38 caliber and wadcutter bullets ; 40 mm automatic grenade launchers ; 5.56 mm composite magazines ( for M16 assault rifles ) , and 7.62 X 39 mm and 7.62 X 51 mm composite magazines from [LOC Turkey  ] . 
In addition , we understand that a [MISC Turkish  ] firm may also be pursuing a deal to import plastic explosives and nitrocellulose from [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [LOC U.S.  ] wants to provide this information to [MISC Turkish  ] officials , request that they investigate this activity and use all available means to prevent these firms from exporting and importing such arms to and from [LOC Iran  ] . 
In addition to any domestic [MISC Turkish  ] authorities that may apply , these activities may also be in violation of both [ORG United Nations Security Resolution  ] ( [ORG UNSCR  ] ) 1747 and [LOC U.S.  ] domestic authorities. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG UNSCR  ] 1747: [ORG UNSCR  ] 1747 , paragraph 5 , prohibits [LOC Iran  ] from supplying , selling or transferring from its territory any " arms or related materiel . 
" It also requires all states to prohibit the procurement of such items from [LOC Iran  ] by their nationals , or using their flag vessels or aircraft ; whether or not such transfers originated in the territory of [LOC Iran  ] . 
The procurement of plastic explosives from [LOC Iran  ] would violate [ORG UNSCR  ] 1747. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC North Korea  ] , and [ORG Syria Nonproliferation Act  ] ( [ORG INKSNA  ] ) : [ORG INKSNA  ] authorizes sanctions against any foreign person that transfers to or from [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC North Korea  ] , or [LOC Syria  ] goods , services , or technology controlled by multilateral control lists ( e.g. , [ORG Nuclear Suppliers Group  ] , [ORG Missile Technology Control Regime  ] , [ORG Australia Group  ] , or [ORG Wassenaar Arrangement  ] ) ; of the same kind as those on multilateral control lists , but falling below the control list parameters , when it is determined that such goods , services , and technologies have the potential to make a material contribution to [ORG WMD  ] , or cruise or ballistic missile systems ; on [LOC U.S.  ] national control lists for WMD/missile reasons that are not on multilateral lists ; or with the potential of making a material contribution to [ORG WMD  ] , or cruise or ballistic missile systems . 
Accordingly , the [LOC U.S.  ] is concerned that if the [MISC Turkish  ] firms proceed with transferring the grenade launchers , bullets , and ammunition magazines , we would be required to report this to the [ORG U.S. Congress  ] and the [MISC Turkish  ] firms could be subject to [LOC U.S.  ] sanctions. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [LOC U.S.  ] is also concerned about the potential exports to [LOC Iran  ] because one of the items may be of [LOC U.S.  ] origin . 
According to [ORG Defense Security Cooperation Agency  ] ( [ORG DSCA  ] ) records , [LOC Turkey  ] received 181 [ORG MK-19  ] 40 mm grenade launchers from the [LOC United States  ] in 1995 . 
However , we do not know definitively if any of these are among the 40 mm grenade launchers contemplated as part of the sale to [LOC Iran  ] . 
We note , however , that if any [MISC U.S.-origin  ] defense equipment ( including technical data ) is re-transferred to [LOC Iran  ] , that would violate [ORG Section  ] 3 of the [ORG Arms Export Control Act  ] ( [ORG AECA  ] ) . 
As a consequence , [LOC Turkey  ] could lose its country eligibility under the [ORG AECA  ] to purchase or lease defense articles , including Patriot or [MISC Reaper  ] unmanned aerial vehicles , or services , or to receive credits or guarantees relating to any purchase or lease. ------------------------- ACTION REQUEST/OBJECTIVES ------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Post is requested to approach [ORG GOT  ] officials to pursue the following objectives and to deliver the talking points/non-paper in paragraph 8 below as appropriate: -- Thank [MISC Turkish  ] officials for [LOC Turkey  ] 's continued cooperation and support in preventing the transfer of arms or related material to and from [LOC Iran  ] ; -- Inform the [ORG GOT  ] that we are very concerned that [MISC Turkish  ] firms may be exporting to and importing from [LOC Iran  ] arms and related material ; -- Note that the export of [ORG Wassenaar Arrangement  ] controlled items to [LOC Iran  ] could require a report to the [ORG U.S. Congress  ] under the [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC North Korea  ] , and [ORG Syria Nonproliferation Act  ] ( [ORG INKSNA  ] ) and may result in sanctions being imposed on the entities and individuals involved ; -- Point out that the import of arms or related material from [LOC Iran  ] would violate [ORG UNSCR  ] 1747 , which prohibits [LOC Iran  ] from supplying , selling or transferring from its territory any " arms or related materiel " and requires all states to prohibit the procurement of such items from [LOC Iran  ] by their nationals ; -- Emphasize this is not the time for business as usual with [LOC Iran  ] ; -- Remind the [ORG GOT  ] that both the [ORG DIO  ] and [ORG Parchin  ] were designated for an asset freeze under [MISC UNSCRs  ] 1737 and 1747 , respectively , and were sanctioned by the [LOC U.S.  ] under Executive Order ( [ORG E.O  ] . 
) 13382 ; -- Strongly urge the [ORG GOT  ] to use available legal authorities , including appropriate domestic laws and authorities related to implementing [MISC UNSCRs  ] 1737 and 1747 , to immediately terminate these deals and freeze any assets of [ORG DIO  ] ; -- Note that [LOC Iran  ] has a long history of providing arms and other military equipment to terrorist groups and that these items could easily end up in the hands of al-Qaida , [ORG Hamas  ] , [ORG Hizballah  ] , and the [ORG Taliban  ] ; -------------- TALKING POINTS -------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S//REL [LOC TURKEY  ] ) [PER Begin  ] talking points: -- We appreciate the Government of [LOC Turkey  ] 's continued cooperation and support in preventing the transfer of military equipment and related materiel to and from [LOC Iran  ] . 
-- In the spirit of this cooperation , we want to share with you some additional information about [MISC Turkish  ] firms involved in dealings concerning arms and related materiel with [LOC Iran.  ] --------------- EXPORTS TO [LOC IRAN  ] --------------- -- We have information that the [MISC Turkish  ] firms [PER Mercan Tanitim  ] Dis Ticaret ve [ORG Muhendislik Ltd.  ] and [ORG Makina ve Kimya Endustrisi Kurumu  ] ( [ORG MKEK  ] ) may sign a contract to export military material to [LOC Iran  ] . 
-- The items covered by the contract include: [ORG FMJ  ] ( [ORG Full Metal Jacket  ] ) .38 caliber and wadcutter bullets ; 40 mm automatic grenade launchers ; 5.56 mm composite magazines ( for [MISC M16  ] assault rifles ) , and 7.62 X 39 mm and 7.62 X 51 mm composite magazines , all of which are specified on the [ORG Wassenaar Arrangement Munitions List  ] . 
-- In addition , according to the [ORG Defense Security Cooperation Agency  ] ( [ORG DSCA  ] ) records , [LOC Turkey  ] received 181 [ORG MK-19  ] 40 mm grenade launchers from the [LOC United States  ] in 1995 . 
We do not know , definitively , if any of these were among the 40 mm grenade launchers contemplated as part of the sale to [LOC Iran  ] . 
-- We should note , however , that if any [MISC U.S.-origin  ] defense equipment ( including technical data ) is re-transferred to [LOC Iran  ] , that transfer would violate [ORG Section  ] 3 of the [ORG U.S. Arms Export Control Act  ] ( [ORG AECA  ] ) . 
As a consequence , [LOC Turkey  ] could lose its country eligibility under the [ORG AECA  ] to purchase or lease defense articles . 
This could potentially include Patriot or [MISC Reaper  ] unmanned aerial vehicles , or services , or the ability to receive credits or guarantees relating to any purchase or lease. ----------------- IMPORTS FROM [LOC IRAN  ] ----------------- -- In addition to our information related to the export of arms material to [LOC Iran  ] , we also understand some of the same [MISC Turkish  ] firms involved in the exports are interested in procuring arms material from [LOC Iran  ] . 
-- Specifically , we understand that in September 2009 , [PER Mercan Tanitim  ] was pursuing a deal with [ORG MKEK  ] to import 2,000 kg of Composition A-4 military plastic explosives produced by [ORG Parchin Chemical Industries  ] , an [MISC Iranian  ] government military company and an element of the [ORG Defense Industries Organization  ] ( [ORG DIO  ] ) . 
-- We further understand that in September 2009 , the [MISC Turkish  ] companies [ORG Kolorkim Kimya San  ] and [PER Mercan Tanitim  ] were considering a deal to import nitrocellulose ( [LOC NC  ] ) from [LOC Iran  ] . 
[LOC NC  ] is a dual-use material that serves as a major component in smokeless gunpowder . 
-- As a subordinate of [ORG DIO  ] , [ORG Parchin  ] acts on behalf of [ORG DIO  ] , importing and exporting chemical goods throughout the world . 
In April 2007 , [ORG Parchin Chemical Industries  ] was identified as the final recipient of sodium perchlorate monohydrate , a chemical precursor for solid propellant oxidizer , possibly to be used for ballistic missiles . 
-- As you know , [ORG DIO  ] is one of seven [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear-related entities designated for an asset freeze in the [ORG Annex  ] to [ORG UNSCR  ] <a id='par1737' href='#par1737'>¶</a>1737 . 
In addition to being listed in the [ORG Annex  ] for [ORG UNSCR  ] 1737 , [ORG DIO  ] was sanctioned previously by the [LOC United States  ] for [MISC WMD-  ] or missile-related activities under the [LOC Iran  ] and [ORG Syria Nonproliferation Act  ] ( [ORG ISNA  ] ) , the [ORG Arms Export Control Act  ] ( [ORG AECA  ] ) , Executive Order ( [ORG E.O  ] . 
) 13382 , and the [ORG Export Administration Act  ] . 
-- We would further note that [ORG Parchin Chemical Industries  ] has been designated for an asset freeze under [ORG UNSCR  ] 1747 and [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG E.O.  ] 13382 in July 2008 as a consequence of its work on behalf of [LOC Iran  ] 's ballistic missile program . 
We , therefore , urge you , per [ORG UNSCR  ] 1747 , to freeze any assets of [ORG Parchin Chemical Industries  ] that may come under [MISC Turkish  ] jurisdiction . 
-- We would like to inform you that [MISC Turkish  ] firms engaged in business with entities designated under [ORG E.O.  ] 13382 are eligible for sanctions if such activities are not halted . 
-- Given the [ORG UN Security Council  ] 's grave concern over [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear and ballistic missile program activities , we urge you to encourage all [MISC Turkish  ] firms to avoid any affiliation with this company . 
-- [LOC Iran  ] , a [ORG U.S.-designated State Sponsor of Terrorism  ] , has a long history of providing arms and other military equipment to terrorist groups and other non-state actors , including in [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
We are concerned that the materials being negotiated for transfer by the [MISC Turkish  ] companies in question could be diverted by [LOC Iran  ] to such groups . 
-- [LOC Iran  ] has long supplied non-state actors , including terrorist groups such as [ORG Hizballah  ] , with arms and other military equipment . 
The terrorist applications of small arms and light weapons ( SA/LW ) are obvious , but [LOC Iran  ] has also supplied terrorists with larger weapons systems that threaten regional security and stability . 
-- Failure to prevent these sales could result in the re-transfer of military material and explosives by [LOC Iran  ] to groups like al-Qaida , [ORG Hamas  ] , [ORG Hizballah  ] , and the [ORG Taliban  ] . 
This would harm the [MISC Turkish  ] government 's reputation as a [ORG NATO  ] ally and demonstrated opponent of terrorism , and would reflect badly on the [MISC Turkish  ] business community . 
-- These transactions could also be damaging to our bilateral relationship as these items can be used to kill and severely injure Coalition forces in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] and elsewhere in the region . 
-- [LOC Turkey  ] is also required to prevent the transfers from [LOC Iran  ] as noted in [ORG UNSCR  ] 1747 , paragraph 5 , which prohibits [LOC Iran  ] from supplying , selling or transferring from its territory any " arms or related materiel . 
" All states are required to prohibit the procurement of such items from [LOC Iran  ] by their nationals , or using their flag vessels or aircraft ; whether or not such transfers originated in the territory of [LOC Iran  ] . 
-- We believe the arms and explosives acquisitions being pursued by [PER Mercan Tanitim  ] and [ORG MKEK  ] with [MISC Iranian  ] entities would clearly violate this provision of [ORG UNSCR  ] 1747 , and that the [PER Kolorkim  ] and [PER Mercan Tanitim  ] deal involving the transfer of nitrocellulose may as well . 
-- Action to prevent such transfers would clearly demonstrate [LOC Turkey  ] 's commitment to the full and effective implementation of [ORG UNSCR  ] 1747 . 
Such action would also remove the possibility that these firms could be subject to [LOC U.S.  ] sanctions under the [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC North Korea  ] , and [ORG Syria Nonproliferation Act  ] ( [ORG INKSNA  ] ) . 
-- We strongly urge you to investigate this information and prevent any transfers being contemplated by the entities involved by using authorities available under [MISC Turkish  ] domestic law . 
-- Please share with us the results of your investigation at your earliest convenience .
