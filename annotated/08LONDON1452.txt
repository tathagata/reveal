<code><pre>Friday , 23 May 2008 , 13:58 S E C R E T [LOC LONDON  ] 001452 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 05/22/2018 TAGS ECON , [ORG ETTC  ] , [ORG KNNP  ] , [ORG PARM  ] , [ORG PGOV  ] , [ORG PHUM  ] , [ORG PREL  ] , [ORG IR  ] , [ORG PK  ] , [LOC UK  ] SUBJECT: IRAN: FOREIGN SECRETARY SAYS [LOC UK  ] TO LEAD FINANCIAL PRESSURE ON [LOC TEHRAN  ] REF: A. [LOC LONDON  ] 1396 [LOC B. LONDON  ] 1352 [PER C. STATE  ] 54639 [PER D. STATE  ] 51207 Classified [ORG By: Acting Political Counselor  ] [PER Leslie Tsou  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Foreign Secretary Milliband is “very aware” of the centrality of financial measures , both multilateral and bilateral , to the creation of effective pressure on [LOC Tehran  ] , and has told the [ORG FCO  ] that HMG will be “at the forefront” of international financial efforts against [LOC Iran  ] and will push its [ORG EU  ] partners on [LOC Iran  ] “as hard as possible , ” [ORG FCO Iran  ] contacts told [ORG London Iran  ] Watcher ( Poloff ) May 21 , following HMG’s recent engagement in [LOC Washington  ] and [LOC London  ] with senior [ORG Department of State  ] officials . 
This [ORG FCO  ] statement of the UK’s newly reinvigorated posture on financial measures reflects the judgments , and action recommendations , made in ref b . 
Pushing [LOC UK  ] banks and [ORG EU  ] Partners -------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [LOC UK  ] officials , including the [ORG Financial Services Authority  ] , will “push the legal envelope” to limit [MISC Iranian  ] banking activity by both [MISC Iranian  ] and [LOC UK  ] financial institutions in [LOC London  ] and [LOC UK  ] diplomats in [LOC Brussels  ] will lead the charge for very tough language in the [ORG EU  ] [MISC Common Position  ] on [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Neil Kernohan  ] , the Sanctions Officer for the [ORG FCO’s Iran Coordination Group  ] , said . 
[PER Kernohan  ] noted the [MISC Common Position  ] would be the first [ORG EU  ] item of business once [LOC Iran  ] has reacted to the [ORG P5  ] 1 offer , and once the [ORG EU  ] has designated [ORG Bank Melli  ] . 
Reiterating the timing considerations ( ref a ) which led the date of the [MISC EU’s  ] expected designation of [LOC Melli  ] to be delayed from May 19 to mid-June , [PER Kernohan  ] said [ORG FCO  ] sees June 17 as the most likely date for [ORG EU  ] designation of [ORG Bank Melli  ] , assuming [LOC Iran  ] has by then rejected the [ORG P5  ] 1 incentives package . 
[ORG Bank Melli  ] in [LOC Karachi  ] , [ORG GAERC  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) Kernohan’s comments came in the course of a call by Poloff to deliver [ORG USG  ] points in ref d , on the need for vigilance on [ORG Bank Melli’s  ] efforts to open a branch in [LOC Pakistan  ] , as well as pre-GAERC points contained in ref c . 
[PER Kernohan  ] noted full HMG support for the content of both [ORG USG  ] demarches , while noting the adjusted time frame for [ORG EU  ] action per para . 
2 above . 
Embassy also delivered ref d to [ORG HM Treasury  ] on May 16. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Embassy Comment: While there is inevitably an element of “telling us what we want to hear” in Kernohan’s very upbeat message , all the signals we have seen since the Secretary’s May 2-3 visit are that [ORG USG  ] engagement with HMG on [LOC Iran  ] , especially at senior levels , has gotten Foreign Secretary Milliband’s attention . 
This is particularly the case with respect to bilateral financial measures , where the [LOC UK  ] has the most equities at risk , but also where it can provide the most meaningful leadership on the [LOC Iran  ] nuclear issue to governments both in [LOC Europe  ] and other regions .
