( C/NF ) Summary: In April 2009 , officials of [ORG Millennium BCP  ] , [LOC Portugal  ] 's leading private bank , visited [LOC Iran  ] at the invitation of the [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Lisbon  ] and met with the [ORG Central Bank  ] and other entities in the financial sector to discuss [LOC Iran  ] 's interest in establishing a business relationship with [ORG Millennium  ] . 
On February 5 , [ORG Millennium Executive Board  ] Chairman [PER Carlos Santos Ferreira  ] discussed the proposal with [PER Poleconoff  ] and its possible benefit to the [ORG USG  ] . 
While he claimed that the costs could outweigh the benefits to [ORG Millennium  ] , [PER Ferreira  ] is willing to establish a relationship with [LOC Iran  ] to help the [ORG USG  ] track [MISC Iranian  ] assets and financial activities . 
[ORG Millennium  ] has consulted with the [ORG Bank of Portugal  ] and senior government officials , and would like our views on its proposed relationship with [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Washington  ] 's interest in tracking [MISC Iranian  ] accounts in [LOC Portugal  ] . 
We request [LOC Washington  ] guidance ; our recommendation is that [ORG Millennium  ] not pursue the relationship . 
However , given that [PER Ferreira  ] may do so regardless of [ORG USG  ] recommendations , it might be prudent to maintain open channels of communication with [PER Ferreira  ] . 
Post will track developments and discourage deeper relations with [LOC Iran  ] .

( C/NF ) On February 5 , [PER Poleconoff  ] met with [PER Carlos Santos Ferreira  ] , Chairman of the [ORG Executive Board of Millennium BCP  ] ( formerly the [ORG Portuguese Commercial Bank  ] ) , at the request of [PER Ferreira  ] 's advisor who is a longtime contact of the [ORG Embassy  ] . 
[PER Ferreira  ] discussed a proposal by the [MISC Iranian  ] banking sector to establish a relationship with [ORG Millennium  ] to further trade and commercial opportunities . 
He noted that [LOC Iran  ] has other options in [LOC Europe  ] but may be interested in [LOC Portugal  ] for its less restrictive regulatory environment . 
( [LOC Iran  ] already has relations with various [MISC European  ] banks , including [ORG HSBC  ] , [ORG Deutsche Bank  ] , [ORG Danske  ] , and [ORG Banque Commercial de Placement  ] . 
) [PER Ferreira  ] insisted that while the costs of the [MISC Iranian  ] proposal could outweigh the benefits to [ORG Millennium  ] , the bank would be open to establishing a relationship with [LOC Iran  ] in order to help the [ORG USG  ] track the financial activities of the [MISC Iranian  ] government. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) Early last year , the [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Lisbon  ] contacted [PER Ferreira  ] , who had previous contact with that embassy while serving as Chairman of the [ORG Board of Directors  ] of [ORG Oeiras Foundation  ] ( 1987-1989 ) , a state entity that he says sold munitions to [LOC Iran  ] more than 20 years ago . 
[ORG Millennium Bank  ] advised Prime Minister [PER Socrates  ] and senior government officials , including the governor of the [ORG Bank of Portugal  ] ( [LOC Portugal  ] 's central bank ) , of [LOC Iran  ] 's interest in establishing a relationship with [ORG Millennium  ] and having [ORG Millennium  ] officials visit [LOC Iran  ] for meetings. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) In April 2009 , a few weeks after [MISC Portuguese  ] MFA Political Director [PER Nuno Brito  ] was in [LOC Tehran  ] ( Ref B ) , two [ORG Millennium  ] officials -- [PER Jose Joao Guilherme  ] , member of the [ORG Executive Board of Directors  ] who is responsible for the bank 's international portfolio , and [PER Duarte Pitta Ferraz  ] , Head of the [ORG International Affairs Unit  ] -- visited [LOC Iran  ] for five days at the invitation of the [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Lisbon  ] . 
They met with senior representatives of the [ORG Central Bank  ] , seven banks ( including three private banks ) , the [ORG Organization for Investment , Economic  ] , and [ORG Technical Assistance of Iran  ] ( [ORG OIETAI  ] ) , and the [MISC Portuguese  ] [ORG Embassy  ] to discuss [ORG EU  ] restrictions on [LOC Iran  ] and potential business opportunities within those constraints . 
The banks expressed interest in establishing relations with [ORG Millennium  ] in the traditional areas of trade and finance. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) Based on the meetings and information provided by officials of the [MISC Iranian Central Bank  ] and the [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs  ] , [ORG Millennium  ] selected four priority banks for further consideration: the [ORG Export Development Bank of Iran  ] ( [ORG EDBI  ] ) , [PER Bank  ] Tejarat , [ORG Bank Parsian  ] , and [ORG EN Bank  ] , which have SWIFT codes . 
The [ORG EU  ] is currently restricted by [ORG UN  ] sanctions from doing business with [ORG Melli Iran Bank  ] and [ORG Saderat Iran Bank  ] . 
According to [ORG Millennium  ] officials , no other [MISC Iranian  ] bank is subject to [ORG UN  ] sanctions .

According to the report , [ORG EDBI  ] told [ORG Millennium  ] officials that [LOC Brazil  ] is not overly concerned about respecting international sanctions since " independent countries can make independent decisions . 
" ( [ORG PROTECT  ] ) <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C/NF ) [LOC Portugal  ] has very few [MISC Iranian  ] residents and very little trade with [LOC Iran  ] . 
[LOC Portugal  ] 's trade with [LOC Iran  ] totals less than 40 million euros per year , while [MISC Iranian  ] oil represents about 9 percent of [LOC Portugal  ] 's oil imports . 
In January 2010 , [PER Brito  ] told Under Secretary of State Burns that [LOC Portugal  ] had no intention of furthering its economic relationship with [LOC Iran  ] at this time . 
However , [LOC Portugal  ] is keeping its options open for future investments ( Ref A ) . <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) [ORG Millennium  ] anticipates engaging in the following activities , which [PER Ferreira  ] insists are in compliance with [ORG EU  ] banking laws and regulations and [ORG UN  ] sanctions , if it were to agree to establish a relationsh/MQQ7#^QQQare not currently on any sanctions list and in accordance with the condition above ; ( 3 ) undertake transactions on behalf of [MISC Iranian  ] credit institutions with additional monitoring and oversight mechanisms to prevent money laundering and terrorism finance ; and ( 4 ) continue to conduct , on a case-by-case basis , operations of support to client companies that export to [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 .

On February 10 , it reported a 12-percent increase in net profit in 2009 , with 225 million euros , helped by the sale of a nearly 50 percent stake in its [MISC Angolan  ] subsidiary . 
The [ORG GOP  ] 's state-run [ORG Caixa Geral de Depositos  ] has a small stake ( 2.5 percent as of June 2009 ) in [ORG Millennium  ] .

( C/NF ) POST RECOMMENDATION/GUIDANCE REQUEST: [PER Ferreira  ] told us he would be willing to allow the [ORG USG  ] to monitor the [MISC Iranian  ] accounts in [ORG Millennium  ] in a manner to be mutually agreed upon , and he seeks our views on such an arrangement . 
Post recommendation is that our basic response to [PER Ferreira  ] be that [ORG Millennium  ] not pursue any relationship with any [MISC Iranian  ] entities . 
However , it is quite possible that [ORG Millennium  ] will pursue the relationship regardless of [ORG USG  ] recommendations . 
Therefore , post recommends that we maintain open channels of communication with [PER Ferreira  ] in order to maintain some visibility on the [MISC Iranian  ] accounts should [ORG Millennium  ] go ahead and set them up . 
Post requests [LOC Washington  ] guidance in responding to [PER Ferreira  ] 's proposal , as well as views on [ORG Millennium  ] 's proposed relationship with [LOC Iran  ] . 
While [PER Ferreira  ] did not explicitly say so , post believes that the [MISC Portuguese  ] MFA is , at a minimum , aware of his approach to the [ORG Embassy  ] . 
[PER Ferreira  ] is open to further communication with post should [LOC Washington  ] need more information . 
[ORG Embassy  ] ORA has cleared this cable .
