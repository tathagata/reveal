END SUMMARY . 
[ORG MINISTRY  ] OF [ORG INTERIOR  ] -------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] directs a civilian force of 146,000 national police who operate with a force of 99,509 national gendarmes to maintain internal security . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] merged the two primary internal intelligence agencies , Direction de la Surveillance du Territoire ( DST ) and [PER Renseignements Gnraux  ] ( [ORG RG  ] ) , in May 2008 to form a [MISC French  ] equivalent to the [ORG FBI  ] . 
The goals of the merger include removing interagency competition detrimental to [LOC France  ] , s counter-terrorism efforts , increasing operational capability , and phasing out redundancies . 
Foreign intelligence agencies now have a single internal intelligence interlocutor in [LOC France  ] , that should increase and simplify cooperation . 
The organization is led by [PER Bernard Squarcini  ] , former deputy director of the [ORG RG  ] , and close friend of President [PER Sarkozy  ] . 
A working group at the directorate general of the national police has been meeting regularly to work out the new structure of the merged intelligence service , including its jurisdiction , size , and missions . 
The media reports that the [ORG RG  ] will no longer monitor public opinion , union activities , and social conflicts , but details of on-the-ground changes in responsibilities remain unknown . 
[PER Frdric Pchenard  ] , director-general of the [MISC French  ] national police is overseeing the merger . 
COUNTER-TERRORISM ----------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC France  ] is one of a number of major [MISC European  ] countries combating terrorism at home and abroad , although it has not suffered a significant terrorist incident in recent years . 
[ORG Al-Qaida  ] in the [MISC Islamic  ] [ORG Maghreb  ] ( [ORG AQIM  ] ) poses a considerable threat to [MISC French  ] interests , underscored by statements made by al-Qaida senior leadership or [ORG AQIM  ] itself . 
Local [MISC Corsican  ] separatists , [ORG Basque Fatherland and Liberty  ] ( [ORG ETA  ] ) members and ultra-left anarchist factions have been responsible for the majority of recent attacks and arrests of individuals suspected of involvement in terrorist activities or membership of groups deemed terrorist . 
The number and violence of [ORG ETA  ] and [MISC Corsican  ] attacks in [LOC France  ] have continued to drop , but [LOC France  ] is at once a target as well as a potential staging area for international [MISC Islamic  ] terrorist groups , including [ORG Kurdistan Workers  ] party affiliates . 
[LOC France  ] remains on high alert and recognizes its continuing status as a target of [ORG AQIM  ] and of other extremist groups in [LOC France  ] and abroad. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Loic Garnier  ] was appointed in June to succeed [PER Christophe Chaboud  ] as the head of the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] , s [ORG Unite de Coordination de la Lutte Anti-Terroriste  ] ( [ORG UCLAT  ] ) . 
[PER Superintendant Garnier  ] was formerly chief of the criminal brigade , the elite unit of the judicial police in [LOC Paris  ] . 
RADICALISM ---------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In addition to undertaking operations to arrest and prosecute terrorists , [LOC France  ] continued programs to address radicalization and extremism through the use of social and economic incentives to reduce the susceptibility of at risk populations . 
DOMESTIC POLITICS ----------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Now approaching the midpoint of his five year term , President [PER Sarkozy  ] is comfortably riding the momentum generated by a successful showing in last June 's [MISC European  ] Parliament elections that weakened the [ORG UMP  ] 's primary opponent , the [ORG Socialist Party  ] . 
With the opposition in disarray , [PER Sarkozy  ] hopes to extend his political power base by scoring big in upcoming regional council elections in March <a id='par2010' href='#par2010'>¶</a>2010 . 
Regional elections will be an important snapshot of his presidency at mid-term , and the relative strength of [MISC French  ] political parties before the presidential and legislative elections in 2012 . 
In recent months , [PER Sarkozy  ] and his majority [ORG UMP  ] party have concentrated on joining forces with a number of small political parties from across the political spectrum to ensure his reelection . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] has sought to lead on security and immigration issues , an issue that brought him considerable notoriety during his tenure as Minister of [ORG Interior  ] under President [PER Chirac  ] . 
Anti-immigration sentiment has been a rallying cry for the extremist [ORG National Front  ] . 
MILITARY ISSUES --------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In conjunction with specific gendarmes units used for military operations , the army is responsible for external security under the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] . 
[LOC France  ] currently has over 3,000 troops actively participating in operations in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [ORG Operation Enduring Freedom  ] . 
The current [MISC French  ] commitment includes ground troops and air assets . 
There is growing media discussion in [LOC France  ] about the [PER McChrystal  ] report , which advocates additional troops for [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and the [MISC Obama  ] administration , s review of policy . 
However , [PER Sarkozy  ] used an October 15/16 interview with [ORG Le Figaro  ] ( focused on domestic issues and designed to shore up his base ) , to state that [LOC France  ] would send ¬ one additional soldier8 to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , although there may be room for increased civilian engagement , especially if the [MISC Afghan  ] government is able to restore legitimacy in the wake of the troubled August 20 elections . 
Unlike several other significant [MISC European  ] troop contributors through [ORG ISAF  ] , the [MISC French  ] do not have overly restrictive rules of engagement and have been a strong ally in the field . 
( Note: the &European8 gendarme force [PER Sarkozy  ] proposed last spring will finally begin to arrive in [LOC Afghanistan  ] in December . 
) DATASHARE --------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) We do not have an agreement with [LOC France  ] for Preventing and [MISC Combating Serious Crime  ] ( [ORG PCSC  ] ) . 
The [MISC French  ] have generally pointed to their privacy laws as an impediment . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] side has countered that our privacy laws are similar and not a bar to enhanced datashare . 
The draft text of an Agreement was shared with the [ORG French Ministry of Interior  ] in July 2009 . 
[LOC U.S.  ] Embassy [LOC Paris  ] also transmitted a Diplomatic Note to the [MISC French  ] Foreign Ministry in August 2009 requesting that in-depth discussions on both a [ORG PCSC  ] Agreement and an [MISC HSPD-6  ] agreement concerning terrorist watchlist data begin as soon as possible . 
Despite the difficulties of getting negotiations underway , [LOC U.S.  ] law enforcement officials describe cooperation with their [MISC French  ] Government counterparts as very good within the context of [MISC French  ] privacy restrictions . 
TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS ---------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The constitution and law prohibit trafficking in persons for all purposes . 
However , trafficking in women and children for commercial sexual exploitation , forced labor , and petty crime is a problem . 
Prostitution is legal . 
However , the law prohibits procuring , aiding , assisting , maintaining , publicly soliciting , or profiting from the prostitution of another individual . 
Enforcement of these laws varied , and criminal activity related to prostitution remained a problem . 
The country was a destination for victims , primarily trafficked from [LOC Africa  ] ( notably [LOC Cameroon  ] and [LOC Nigeria  ] ) , [ORG Central  ] and [LOC Eastern Europe  ] ( notably [LOC Bulgaria  ] and [LOC Romania  ] ) , the former [LOC Soviet Union  ] , and increasingly [LOC Asia  ] ( notably [LOC China  ] ) , for prostitution and domestic servitude . 
A majority of the estimated 18,000 women in the country , s commercial sex trade were likely victims of trafficking . 
Traffickers operated principally in small criminal networks characterized as &micro-trafficking networks8 that included both citizens and foreigners . 
They used various methods to recruit and retain victims including force , fraud , identification document confiscation , cultural isolation , and physical and psychological abuse . 
Several law enforcement agencies were involved in combating trafficking . 
The government cooperated bilaterally and with international institutions such as the [ORG European Police Agency  ] ( [ORG Europol  ] ) to investigate , track , and dismantle trafficking networks , initiating more than 500 court cases for soliciting and dismantling over 23 pimping networks in 2008 . 
Authorities worked with officials in other countries , particularly source countries , to counter trafficking and identified 822 victims during the year . 
COUNTRY CONDITIONS ------------------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) [LOC France  ] is a first-world western democracy with a varied economy and one of the most diverse populations in [LOC Western Europe  ] . 
At least 20% of the [MISC French  ] population of approximately 65 million people has either a parent or a grandparent who is or was not originally [MISC French  ] . 
Most [MISC European  ] migrants who arrived before about 1970 have integrated fairly effectively into [MISC French  ] life ; however , more recent migrants and their families , many from the former [MISC French  ] colonies , have not been able to find a place in [MISC French  ] society as readily . 
Although there are no official statistics , fully ten percent of [LOC France  ] , s population is [MISC Muslim  ] , which have helped inform the country , s developed and nuanced views from the [LOC Middle East Peace Process to assimilation  ] of minority populations . 
[LOC France  ] continues to be an asylum destination for immigrants attracted by [LOC France  ] 's relatively generous social security , welfare and education systems . 
Many migrants remain in [LOC France  ] " without papers " to work illegally ( estimates range from 300,000 to 400,000 clandestine residents in 2008 ) . 
The Government of [LOC France  ] has responded with a combination of integration and enforcement measures. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) The worldwide economic crisis has increased the unemployment rate to 7.8 percent in the fourth quarter of <a id='par2008' href='#par2008'>¶</a>2008 . 
High unemployment among the young ( especially undereducated young men of foreign origin ) , public tensions among those of different social and ethnic groups , and inadequate low-income housing all contribute to political , social , and economic criticism of the [PER Sarkozy  ] administration . 
Good luck with your travels in the region . 
We look forward to welcoming you again to [LOC Paris  ] . 
Best regards , [PER RIVKIN</pre></code>  ]
