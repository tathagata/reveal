( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY: The fourth meeting of the [ORG Economic Partnership Dialogue  ] ( [ORG EPD  ] ) provides an excellent opportunity to reinforce the importance the [ORG USG  ] attaches to deepening and expanding the positive economic agenda between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] . 
This meeting will permit the two sides to cement a broader partnership under the [ORG Dialogue  ] created to launch new economic cooperation opportunities between State and the [ORG Ministry of External Relations  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) and to provide impetus and support to initiatives developed in other channels . 
Our economic interests in engaging with [LOC Brazil  ] are bilateral , including increasing trade and investment opportunities through addressing regulatory barriers and liberalizing civil aviation ; regional , including promoting labor standards ; and global , including development cooperation as well as engagement in fora including G20 and the [ORG WTO  ] . 
The December 14 meeting will further cement our expanding development cooperation partnership in [LOC Africa  ] and [LOC Haiti  ] and deepen our dialogue on the regulatory and business climate issues that support innovation and competitiveness . 
This [ORG Dialogue  ] is an opportunity to lay out our vision for the [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] economic relationship as [LOC Brazil  ] continues to develop as a significant regional and global economic player , potentially laying the foundation for expanded positive cooperation in other policy areas over time . 
END SUMMARY OVERVIEW 2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Brazil  ] is a developing country moving onto the global stage . 
The tenth largest world economy , [LOC Brazil  ] has evolved from [ORG IMF  ] creditor to donor , from development assistance recipient to provider , and from a country that suffered extreme economic shocks to a country emerging early from the global crisis and confident in its macroeconomic policy . 
New offshore pre-salt finds could eventually lead to [LOC Brazil  ] becoming a significant oil and gas exporter . 
The [ORG Mission  ] continues to seek opportunities to deepen investment and trade ties with [LOC Brazil  ] bilaterally in order to increase business opportunities , job growth , and economic development . 
We are building partnerships with [LOC Brazil  ] to promote regional and global economic and social inclusion goals , including addressing the global financial crisis , trade liberalization , and economic development cooperation . 
We continue to work with [LOC Brazil  ] to build consensus for [ORG World Trade Organization  ] trade liberalization ; to promote enhanced cooperation in fora such as [ORG Organization  ] for [ORG Economic Cooperation and Development  ] , [ORG World Health Organization  ] and [ORG International Civil Aviation Organization  ] ; and to create the conditions for global development and prosperity . 
At the same time , we are cooperating with [LOC Brazil  ] to address the regulatory , legal and infrastructure challenges that constrain [LOC Brazil  ] 's growth and social inclusion goals and hurt [LOC U.S.  ] exporters and investors . 
3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Economic issues are proving to be the pathway to increasingly productive [PER GOB  ] engagement - both because as a large emerging economy it is beginning to have a natural seat at the table and because [PER GOB  ] most easily sees how global economic issues directly impact its own well-being and national security . 
Constructive engagement in the G20 has given [LOC Brazil  ] increased confidence that it can and should engage in issues outside its own borders . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's interest in taking on the leadership mantle economically offers numerous opportunities for engagement , encouraging [LOC Brazil  ] to take on increasingly responsible roles globally . 
It is important to frame approaches to [PER GOB  ] as a partner , and not a junior partner . 
[PER GOB  ] takes particular pride that , having been through many developing country experiences ( previous financial crises , addressing [MISC GINI  ] inequalities , infrastructure impact on growth , etc ) , it is uniquely placed to help developing countries tackle their own challenges , drawing on [MISC Brazilian  ] " lessons learned . 
" [PER GOB  ] has been receptive to partnering with us on development cooperation , including a newly developing initiative in [LOC Mozambique  ] and [LOC Haiti  ] on agriculture , health and infrastructure development . 
Cooperation on political and security issues remains more difficult to navigate , where [PER GOB  ] is less persuaded that playing an active role on issues beyond its borders has implications for its own domestic and global security and tends sometimes to stress a " no judgment " approach on many issues that reflect in part its own sovereignty sensitivities . 
This , too , is evolving , though more slowly than on the economic side . 
[LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001412 002 OF 006 3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Brazil  ] is a country where personal relationships matter a great deal . 
President [PER Lula  ] and POTUS' positive interactions have translated into tangible follow-on action , such as Finance Minister [PER Mantega  ] 's ( not previously notable for an eagerness to engage the [LOC United States  ] ) recent travel to the [LOC United States  ] to meet Treasury Secretary [PER Geithner  ] and urge resumption of a bilateral MOF/Treasury dialogue . 
[ORG MRE  ] contacts have stressed that FM [MISC Amorim  ] is personally committed to the success of the [ORG EPD  ] . 
[ORG MRE  ] is delighted that U/S Hormats will lead the [ORG Dialogue  ] on the [LOC United States  ] side . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] chair , Undersecretary for Economic Affairs [PER Pedro Mendonca  ] , is an experienced diplomat responsible for the [ORG WTO  ] negotiations and is [LOC Brazil  ] 's G20 [LOC Sherpa  ] . 
[ORG POLITICAL CONTEXT  ] 4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Brazilian  ] political elite and media are already focused on the October 2010 national elections for president , governors of all 26 states and the federal district , two-thirds of the senate , and all federal deputies . 
Ministers who intend to run for any of these offices must , under [MISC Brazilian  ] law , resign by April 2010 ( six months before elections ) , and some will leave in March or earlier . 
Although many Ministers are expected to leave , FM [MISC Amorim  ] is expected to remain in place for the duration of the [ORG Lula Administration  ] . 
[PER Lula  ] is constitutionally barred from seeking a third term and has supported Civil Household Minister ( Prime Minister-equivalent ) [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] as his party 's candidate . 
[PER Rousseff  ] is currently a distant second in the polls to likely opposition candidate [LOC Sao Paulo  ] Governor [PER Jose Serra  ] , but the race remains unpredictable this early in the process . 
5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] share the basic goals of fostering hemispheric stability and integration , promoting democracy and human rights , and preventing transnational illicit activity . 
The attainment of a permanent seat on the [ORG UN Security Council  ] has been a central goal of [LOC Brazil  ] 's foreign policy under President [PER Lula  ] 's government . 
Regionally , [PER Lula  ] has maintained [LOC Brazil  ] 's historic focus on stability , seeing good relations with all parties as the best way to achieve this goal . 
As a result , [LOC Brazil  ] maintains an active dialogue with [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] , has worked to foster good relations with [LOC Bolivia  ] and [LOC Ecuador  ] , and has stood firmly on the principle of respect for sovereignty in the region . 
In line with [PER Lula  ] 's demonstrated interest in [LOC Brazil  ] playing a larger role in global issues , as well as expanding [LOC Brazil  ] 's commercial ties , [PER Lula  ] hosted separate visits from [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , [MISC Israeli  ] President [PER Peres  ] , and [MISC Palestinian  ] President [PER Abbas  ] , among others , in November . 
ECONOMIC CONTEXT 6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Brazil  ] 's annual Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) grew 5.1 percent in 2008 , and inflation was 5.8 percent . 
The global economic crisis eroded previous predictions for annual GDP growth for 2009 from four per cent to essentially flat or slightly negative . 
Despite this decline in immediate prospects , [LOC Brazil  ] has weathered the crisis better than most major economies and shows signs of a recovery , led by strong domestic demand and a growing middle class . 
Conservative macroeconomic policies in the years prior to the crisis , and targeted responses during the crisis -- including credit injections in the financial system and tax cuts on automobiles and consumer durables -- played a role in lessening the impact of the global crisis on [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Growth in 2010 is expected to return to approximately 5% . 
That said , [LOC Brazil  ] 's growth potential is constrained by factors including its tax code ( 2600 hours/year to pay taxes ) , its rigid labor law , and its obtuse licensing procedures ( 126 days to start a business ) . 
[LOC Brazil  ] ranks 129 on the [ORG World Bank  ] 's [LOC Ease of Doing Business  ] list . 
7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Brazil  ] is a major producer and exporter . 
Agriculture makes up 36 percent of exports , and the agribusiness sector accounts for 25 percent of [LOC Brazil  ] 's GDP . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is a leading exporter of [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001412 003 OF 006 soybeans , beef , sugar , coffee , and orange juice . 
[LOC Brazil  ] also distinguishes itself as a major exporter of civilian aircraft , steel , and petrochemicals . 
The [LOC United States  ] is [LOC Brazil  ] 's top trading partner overall , although in March [LOC China  ] became [LOC Brazil  ] 's primary export destination . 
Prior to the current financial crisis , [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] trade experienced significant annual growth , surpassing [MISC USD  ] 60 billion in 2008 . 
[LOC Brazil  ] typically experiences a slight positive balance in the trade relationship . 
However , in the first three quarters of 2009 , [MISC Brazilian  ] exports to the [LOC United States  ] totaled [MISC USD  ] 11.4 billion , while imports from the [LOC United States  ] totaled [MISC USD  ] 14.8 billion , resulting in a slightly negative trade balance . 
8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In recent years , [LOC U.S.  ] Foreign Direct Investment ( [ORG FDI  ] ) in [LOC Brazil  ] has averaged around [MISC USD  ] 4 billion per year . 
In the second quarter of 2009 ( the most recent available data ) , the [ORG Bureau of Economic Analysis  ] reported [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG FDI  ] into [LOC Brazil  ] of [MISC USD  ] 1.2 billion . 
The Economist noted recently that [ORG FDI  ] into [LOC Brazil  ] from all sources increased 30% last year , while overall [ORG FDI  ] worldwide contracted 14% . 
At the same time , [LOC Brazil  ] has significant offensive investment interests . 
Illustrating a trend of increasing external investment , [ORG Brazilian Central Bank  ] figures show that the stock of [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG FDI  ] in the [LOC United States  ] increased from [MISC USD  ] 3.9 billion in 2006 to [MISC USD  ] 6.025 billion in 2007 ( the last year for which figures are available ) . 
[LOC Brazil  ] holds investment grade status from the major rating entities . 
ANNOTATED [ORG EPD  ] AGENDA TOPICS 9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The topics below follow the order of the [ORG EPD  ] agenda: CIVIL AVIATION: The [ORG EPD  ] will welcome the continued implementation of the June 2008 civair agreement . 
You may wish to note our hope that expanded flight possibilities into the north/northeast of [LOC Brazil  ] will further social inclusion objectives , as potential increased [MISC American  ] tourism and other business opportunities could also benefit development objectives in that region . 
We are exploring with [ORG ANAC  ] whether further liberalization in air cargo is possible in the near term and can welcome [ORG MRE  ] confirmation that the civair authority , [ORG ANAC  ] , is prepared to meet again in 2010 to discuss [MISC Open Skies  ] possibilities . 
COMPETITIVENESS: The last [ORG EPD  ] session agreed the [ORG Joint Commission  ] on Science and Technology ( [ORG JCM  ] ) would discuss innovation and report to the [ORG EPD  ] . 
The November 19-20 [ORG JCM  ] in [LOC Washington  ] discussed [LOC United States'  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] 's efforts to promote innovation and means of governmental cooperation . 
Members of the [ORG U.S. Delegation  ] pointed to the importance of certain institutional features , including an effective intellectual property rights regime and a tradition of venture and " angel " investing to foster innovation and therefore competitiveness . 
They recognized that not all countries will or should follow the same innovation model as the [LOC United States  ] , but underlined the importance of the government 'not getting in the way' of private sector innovation . 
[ORG Commerce Department  ] representatives noted the creation of the [ORG Office of Innovation and Entrepreneurship  ] and the [ORG National Advisory Council on Innovation and Entrepreneurship  ] , designed to bring a whole of government approach to fostering innovation . 
The [ORG Brazilian Delegation  ] pointed out that [LOC Brazil  ] is still a developing nation and therefore has a different perspective than developed nations on a variety of topics related to innovation . 
These include differences in opinion about the role of intellectual property rights and a strong view that the government must play an active role , e.g. , through providing incentives , in fostering innovation . 
Despite these differences , the [ORG Brazilian Delegation  ] was very interested in working with the [ORG USG  ] to find ways to better foster innovation in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Possible next steps include a workshop to identify common areas of interest , a workshop or white paper to begin tackling the idea of how to benchmark public-private partnerships and public sector innovation incentives , and a workshop to identify new models of cooperation ; to include financial , political and other aspects to support innovation and competitiveness . 
On-going efforts under the [MISC DOC-MDIC  ] ( [ORG Trade Ministry  ] ) [ORG Commercial Dialogue  ] include cooperation on venture capital . 
[LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001412 004 OF 006 OECD: [ORG MRE  ] has indicated that the [ORG OECD Secretariat  ] has suggested increased [MISC Brazilian  ] participation in [ORG OECD  ] labor and health under [LOC Brazil  ] 's Enhanced Engagement program . 
[ORG MRE  ] is interested in hearing our experiences working in these areas with the [ORG OECD  ] , from how effective and useful we have found the [ORG OECD  ] role in these topics to how the [ORG USG  ] organizes to cover these committees . 
The discussion provides an opportunity to continue to encourage [ORG GOB  ] movement toward eventual [ORG OECD  ] membership . 
AGRICULTURE: [ORG MRE  ] understands that [ORG USDA  ] has the lead in [ORG USG  ] on [LOC CODEX  ] and on the [ORG Consultative Committee  ] on Agriculture ( [ORG CCA  ] ) . 
Regardless , the [MISC Brazilians  ] wish to emphasize again their concerns regarding developing country participation in [LOC CODEX  ] and to press State to urge a meeting in the near term for the USDA-Ministry of Agriculture ( [ORG MAPA  ] ) [ORG CCA  ] . 
A technical level meeting rather than a [ORG CCA  ] may be the appropriate next engagement on the issues [ORG MAPA  ] wishes to discuss . 
REGULATORY DIALOGUE: [ORG MRE  ] has expressed a new interest in supporting and fostering further regulator to regulator cooperation and exchange . 
Regulatory reform is critical to improving the business climate in [LOC Brazil  ] for [LOC U.S.  ] exporters and investors . 
[ORG MRE  ] support could be helpful in encouraging [MISC Brazilian  ] regulatory agencies to engage further , and [ORG MRE  ] buy-in ensures regulator to regulator initiatives come to fruition . 
Current cooperation , at differing levels of engagement , includes [ORG FCC/ANATEL  ] , [ORG FAA/ANAC  ] , [ORG TSA/ANAC  ] , [ORG NIST/INMETRO  ] , [ORG FED/CADE  ] , [ORG FDA/ANVISA  ] and [ORG FERC/ANEEL  ] ( details e-mailed to [ORG WHA  ] and [ORG EEB  ] ) . 
Deeper and broader cooperation could , for example , help address [ORG TBT  ] and SPS barriers , make progress toward mutual recognition agreements , and expand bilateral cooperation on regulatory issues in third countries . 
TRADE FACILITIATION: Already an active area of cooperation , [ORG GOB  ] and [MISC Brazilian  ] industry have provided significant feedback that intensified cooperation on trade facilitation would be welcome . 
[ORG USDOC  ] and [ORG CAMEX  ] have sponsored two week-long trips this year for [ORG GOB  ] agencies to learn how customs clearance and inter-agency coordination works in the [LOC United States  ] . 
Other activities include seminars held by [ORG CBP  ] in [LOC Brazil  ] for [MISC Brazilian  ] Customs and the [ORG Federal Police  ] , and a [ORG Commercial Dialogue Trade Facilitation  ] meeting held in [LOC Manaus  ] in November 2009 . 
The [ORG CEO Forum  ] has also prioritized trade facilitation . 
There is some sensitivity regarding the [ORG CBP Trade Facilitation  ] and [ORG Supply Chain Security Program  ] within [ORG MRE  ] . 
While [ORG CAMEX  ] , [ORG MDIC  ] and the trade promotion department within [ORG MRE  ] support and welcome the program , the [ORG MRE  ] transnational crimes office is not familiar with the program and has been less inclined to support . 
[ORG MRE  ] will benefit from the [ORG EPD  ] briefing explaining the advantages to [LOC Brazil  ] in participating . 
[ORG MRE  ] also requested to add this topic to the December 9 [ORG U.S.-Brazil Bilateral Consultative Mechanism  ] with [ORG USTR  ] in [LOC Brasilia  ] . 
SECTORAL DIALOGUE: [ORG MRE  ] intends to propose a sectoral event on aeronautics ( including parts and services ) and ask for [ORG USG  ] support for this Brazilian-United [LOC States  ] industry event . 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS: We understand that in addition to resource concerns involved in negotiating a highly technical [MISC Mutual Recognition Agreement  ] ( [ORG MRA  ] ) , [ORG GOB  ] may be reluctant to negotiate on product categories where domestic production exists or where [MISC Brazilian  ] labs currently have certification capacity . 
M E is likely to propose an extremely limited [ORG MRA  ] model covering only products not produced domestically and where no certification capability exists domestically . 
A [ORG MRA  ] would facilitate bilateral exports and provide a model for [LOC Latin America  ] as a whole . 
[LOC Brazil  ] will raise internet governance to urge further internationalization . 
DISTINCTIVE PRODUCTS: [ORG GOB  ] has indicated that it will move its rule-making on whiskey/bourbon forward when [ORG USG  ] moves the cachaca rule-making forward . 
[ORG MRE  ] put this topic on the first [ORG EPD  ] agenda and continues to raise the issue . 
[LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001412 005 OF 006 DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION: The [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] development cooperation in 3rd countries has been a positive story . 
[ORG MRE  ] 's [ORG Brazilian Cooperation Agency  ] ( [ORG ABC  ] ) head [PER Farani  ] has been an active partner , traveling to the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Mozambique  ] with [ORG USG  ] officials to foster and develop that cooperation . 
[ORG USAID  ] and [ORG ABC  ] have negotiated an [ORG MOU  ] which outlines our continued desire for development cooperation in 3rd countries . 
[LOC Brazil  ] would like to discuss the timing of when to sign this [ORG MOU  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] are working on two joint projects in [LOC Mozambique: 1  ] ) agriculture and 2 ) HIV\AIDs . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] led a joint mission to [LOC Mozambique  ] in June 2009 and in August 2009 , a [MISC Brazilian  ] delegation from [ORG ABC  ] and [ORG Embrapa  ] traveled to [LOC Washington  ] to advance discussions on the agriculture project designed to develop an agricultural research platform in [LOC Mozambique  ] . 
In April 2009 , at the invitation of [ORG USAID  ] , a delegation from the [ORG Brazilian Ministry of Health  ] ( [ORG MOH  ] ) visited [LOC Mozambique  ] to become familiar with the [ORG USAID/Mozambique HIV/AIDS  ] portfolio and to identify ways to strengthen the [MISC Mozambican  ] response to the [ORG HIV/AIDS  ] epidemic through trilateral cooperation . 
A [MISC Mozambican  ] delegation visited [LOC Brazil  ] from June 29 to July 2 , 2009 to become familiar with the [MISC Brazilian  ] response to the [ORG HIV/AIDS  ] epidemic and to define the principles that will guide further trilateral cooperation among the three countries . 
Four areas for trilateral cooperation have been identified: improving the visibility , advocacy , and leadership of persons living with [MISC AIDS  ] ; improving communication strategies ; improving [ORG Supply Chain Management  ] ; and institutionalizing monitoring and evaluation systems . 
Project documents for both the agriculture and [ORG HIV/AIDS  ] trilateral cooperation are expected to be finalized in time for implementation to start January 2010 . 
In addition , [ORG CDC  ] is working with the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Ministry of Health  ] on a program to build epidemiological capacity in [LOC Mozambique  ] . 
[ORG ABC  ] and [ORG USAID  ] are also working with [LOC Sao Tome  ] and [LOC Principe  ] on a program to support malaria control activities , focusing support in three primary areas: 1 ) capacity building , 2 ) strengthening malaria surveillance and 3 ) strengthening communications and behavior change . 
The [PER Oswaldo Cruz Institute  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] 's premier medical research facility and the headquarters of their [ORG National School of Public Health  ] , is in the very initial phases of exploring a partnership with State , [ORG NIH  ] , [ORG CDC  ] , and other [ORG USG  ] partners to develop a [ORG National Public Health Institute  ] in [LOC El Salvador  ] . 
Trilateral development cooperation is a win-win in encouraging broader [ORG GOB  ] commitment as a donor , deepening our engagement with [LOC Brazil  ] bilaterally , and benefiting recipient developing countries . 
[PER HAITI: USAID/Brazil  ] and [ORG ABC  ] visited [LOC Port-au-Prince  ] November 22-26 to identify opportunities for trilateral cooperation in [LOC Haiti  ] . 
Areas identified for potential cooperation include joint technical assistance to train garment sector workers ; a jobs program that would promote recycling and advance [LOC Haiti  ] 's alternative energy development opportunities ; bringing [MISC Brazilian  ] artist and musician [PER Carlinhos Brown  ] and [MISC Haitian  ] musician [PER Wyclef Jean  ] together to collaborate with [LOC Brazil  ] and the [LOC United States  ] on a cultural/community center that would serve as a driver for community development ; an infrastructure project bringing [ORG USSOUTHCOM/ USACE  ] and [ORG MINUSTAH  ] engineers together to improve roads , including reconstructing the approach roads to the [ORG USAID  ] funded Ennery bridge project between [LOC Gonaives  ] and [LOC Cap Haitien  ] and the creation/improvement of a number of rural farm-to-market roads . 
USSOUTHCOM also expressed interest in conducting any environmental assessments that may be necessary for the 4C dam project in [ORG Artibonite  ] and in working with the [MISC Brazilians  ] to do joint assessments of existing power plants in the country to identify ways to increase capacity . 
The joint USAID/Brazil-ABC trip to [LOC Haiti  ] continues the close working relationship that has developed between the two organizations and is a first step towards jointly undertaking projects with a significant development impact in [LOC Haiti  ] . 
[ORG MRE  ] will also raise [MISC Brazilian  ] access to the [ORG HOPE  ] program . 
[ORG MRE  ] must consult with [ORG Mercosul  ] partners and pass legislation in order to provide reciprocal [ORG HOPE  ] access . 
[ORG MRE  ] has indicated that [ORG MERCOSUL  ] partners , particularly [LOC Paraguay  ] , have raised objections . 
No legislation has been forwarded to the [MISC Brazilian  ] congress for formal consideration . 
" DECENT LABOR " : [ORG MRE  ] has proposed expanding cooperation in [LOC Latin America  ] on " decent labor , " possibly with a focus on child and/or forced labor . 
While some cooperation in this area already exists , [ORG MRE  ] is interested in exploring the possibility of further joint work in the region . 
We are encouraged that [LOC Brazil  ] is reaching out [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001412 006 OF 006 to deepen regional cooperation on a specific initiative . 
FURTHER FOOD SECURITY COOPERATION IDEAS: On November 13 , FM [ORG Amorim  ] responded to Secretary [PER Clinton  ] 's letter on this issue . 
[ORG MRE  ] will be receptive to further ideas offered at the [ORG EPD  ] . 
INVESTMENT: The [ORG USG  ] and the [MISC Brazilian  ] government have had productive consultations on [ORG Bilateral Investment Treaty  ] ( [ORG BIT  ] ) elements on the margins of previous EPDS , although [LOC Brazil  ] is still cautious about negotiating [MISC BITs  ] given historical congressional opposition . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] Coalition of Industries ( [ORG CNI  ] ) has traditionally been non-supportive of [MISC BITs  ] , seeing them as a constraint on industrial policy , but has recently begun re-examining this position as [MISC Brazilian  ] companies' overseas FDI increases . 
A side session on the margins of the December 14 [ORG EPD  ] will further discuss investment agreement elements , with [ORG MRE  ] interest particularly in [LOC CFIUS  ] and indirect expropriation . 
[ORG GOB  ] has previously indicated a preference to start investment agreement negotiations with a smaller country in the region rather than tackle the topic with [ORG USG  ] , and [ORG Mission  ] has heard informally that [ORG MRE  ] has begun an investment agreement conversation with [LOC Chile  ] . 
The [ORG EPD  ] discussion provides an opportunity for forward momentum toward an eventual [ORG BIT  ] with the [LOC United States  ] . 
[ORG TAX: Progress  ] toward a Bilateral [ORG Tax Treaty  ] has been slow . 
Issues including [MISC OECD-standard  ] transfer pricing and the information exchange requirements under a [MISC BTT  ] remain difficult to bridge . 
[ORG GOB  ] also fears revenue losses under a potential [MISC BTT  ] . 
Meanwhile the more limited 2007 United States-Brazil [ORG Tax Information Exchange Agreement  ] ( [ORG TIEA  ] ) continues to move slowly through the ratification process in the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Congress  ] . 
Eventual ratification is expected . 
TRADE: While trade cooperation is not on the [ORG EPD  ] agenda , the December 9 Bilateral Consultative Mechanism between [ORG USTR  ] and [ORG MRE  ] will explore this topic in depth . 
[ORG GOB  ] has been keen to conclude [LOC Doha  ] , and has carefully balanced protectionist instincts on the [ORG NAMA  ] side with offensive agricultural interests . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] private sector has generally acknowledged [ORG Amorim  ] did a fairly good job in balancing these interests and resists giving more on the [ORG NAMA  ] side ( e.g. , sectoral agreements ) . 
[ORG Amorim  ] is increasingly characterizing the fate of [LOC Doha  ] as being in [LOC U.S.  ] hands . 
At the same time , [ORG GOB  ] is expressing interest in exploring what we can do together bilaterally on trade cooperation . 
While tariffs must be negotiated in 4+1 ( [ORG Mercosul  ] plus [LOC United States  ] ) format , other areas could be discussed bilaterally , with a possibility to build out to 4+1 cooperation if mutual interest exists . 
The cotton case rankles , and [ORG Amorim  ] has talked tough in the press , but [ORG MRE  ] ( and [ORG MDIC  ] ) are well aware the issue is not black and white - [ORG GOB  ] wants to see [ORG USG  ] comply with the ruling , but is aware of the effect on the investment climate of further signaling a lack of commitment to IPR protection .
