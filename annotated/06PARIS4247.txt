( C ) [ORG Socialist Party  ] ( [ORG PS  ] ) First Secretary [PER Francois Hollande  ] and [ORG PS National  ] Secretary for International Affairs [PER Pierre Moscovici  ] briefed the Ambassador June 8 on the turbulent race for the presidential nomination within the [ORG PS  ] and the hurdles facing the party as it looks to next year 's presidential and legislative elections . 
[PER Hollande  ] underlined that , notwithstanding [ORG Poitou-Charentes Region  ] President [PER Segolene Royal  ] 's commanding lead today in polls , both among the public at large and among [ORG PS  ] members , [ORG PS  ] members' convictions as to which [ORG PS  ] leader " is best placed to beat [PER Sarkozy  ] " could well change between now and the [ORG PS  ] 's presidential primary in November . 
[PER Hollande  ] nonetheless believed the primary would produce a clear cut result , " probably in just one round . 
" Asked what might be expected from [MISC French  ] foreign policy under a socialist government , [PER Hollande  ] used the phrase " neither [PER Blair  ] and [PER Chirac  ] " to characterize an overall stance towards the [LOC U.S.  ] that would not be uncritically supportive , but also not be gratuitously obstructionist . 
On [LOC Europe  ] , [PER Moscovici  ] stressed that a Socialist president and government would be much more pro-Europe than President [PER Chirac  ] and the government of Prime Minister [PER Dominique de Villepin  ] . 
END SUMMARY . 
ATMOSPHERICS ------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Over breakfast with the Ambassador at the residence on June 8 , [ORG Socialist Party  ] ( [ORG PS  ] ) First Secretary [PER Francois Hollande  ] and [ORG PS National  ] Secretary for International Affairs [PER Pierre Moscovici  ] were confident , optimistic and dismissive of the drumbeat of media reports that insist that frictions and divisions within the [ORG PS  ] will make it difficult for the party to close ranks behind a single candidate for the 2007 presidential race even after the party primary next November . 
UPCOMING ELECTIONS WILL BE HARD FOUGHT -------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Hollande  ] and [PER Moscovici  ] predicted that the 2007 presidential and legislative elections would be particularly hard fought because neither of the two major parties " can count on more than 30 percent of the electorate . 
" ( [PER Note:  ] The center-left [ORG PS  ] and the center-right [ORG Union  ] for a [ORG Popular Movement  ] ( [ORG UMP  ] ) are the preponderant parties in a political spectrum that includes the small , centrist [ORG Union  ] for [MISC French  ] Democracy ( [ORG UDF  ] ) party along with a range of micro parties . 
Indeed , if the pattern of past presidential elections holds in 2007 , there will be over a dozen candidates competing in the first round of the election . 
End note . 
) [PER Hollande  ] suggested that , since neither of the major parties can aspire to majority status , the [ORG UDF  ] might well find itself with leverage beyond its size , particularly if in the legislative elections that follow the presidential election , neither the [ORG PS  ] nor the [ORG UMP  ] win a near majority of seats . 
[PER Hollande  ] added that , in both the presidential and legislative elections , the [ORG Communist Party  ] ( [ORG PC  ] ) and other far-left parties " would vote against the right , " but not join in any socialist government in the event of a [MISC PS-led  ] legislature. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Hollande  ] expressed his firm conviction that the [ORG PS  ] was well-positioned to win both the presidential and legislative contests , but that both elections will be extremely close . 
Interior Minister [PER Nicolas Sarkozy  ] , barring an unexpected reverse , would be the center-right 's candidate , and -- according to [PER Hollande  ] -- will benefit from the active support of President [PER Chirac  ] , " if [PER Sarkozy  ] is nice to him . 
" That is , according to [PER Hollande  ] , if [PER Sarkozy  ] agrees to look after [PER Chirac  ] loyalists and , by implication , [PER Chirac  ] himself . 
( [PER Note: Chirac  ] will lose his immunity from prosecution upon leaving office ; corruption charges for political financing activities dating from before he became president remain pending against him . 
End note . 
) [PER Hollande  ] said that he did not believe that [PER Chirac  ] would prefer to see the [ORG PS  ] candidate take the presidency rather than see [PER Sarkozy  ] become his successor . 
Even so , [PER Hollande  ] also spoke of the bitterly personal , " fratricidal " rivalries on the center-right , comparing them to the less personal , more ideological rivalries in his center-left , [ORG PS  ] . 
THE CHALLENGE OF REFORM WITHOUT A MANDATE ----------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Hollande  ] said that whoever wins the presidency in 2007 , the electoral system and divisions in the electorate are such that the victor will not have a " mandate for reform , " and certainly not a mandate in the majority rule/winner-takes-all " [MISC American  ] " sense of the term . 
This meant that reforms would come slowly , if at all . 
However , [PER Hollande  ] also ruled out the possibility of a president from one party and a parliamentary majority from another , saying that he believed the back-to-back presidential and legislative elections would both reflect the voters' decision for change . 
This would help , [PER Hollande  ] said , to bring about some significant reforms , albeit slowly . 
UPBEAT ABOUT THE STATE OF THE [ORG PS  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Hollande  ] was bullish and buoyant about the state of the [ORG PS  ] . 
He pointed to the party 's recent consensus on its " project for 2007 " -- a platform statement that all the party 's presidential hopefuls agreed to with little argument -- as evidence of the party 's stability and unity , even as he allowed that it would not be binding on the various candidates . 
[PER Hollande  ] and [PER Moscovici  ] agreed that recent meetings to hammer out the platform were , by [ORG PS  ] standards , rather non-eventful , and the press coverage of rejection of proposals by [PER Royal  ] and others " highly exaggerated . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Hollande  ] proudly underlined the policy statement 's call for enhanced social programs , while admitting , when pressed , that implementing everything it calls for might prove a little " expensive . 
" ( Comment: Indeed , differences over the likely cost of the [ORG PS  ] 's electoral program ( [PER Hollande  ] cites the figure of 30 billion [PER Euros  ] , whereas [MISC Strauss-Kahn  ] has said the price tag is closer to 50 billion ) are sure to fuel controversy over the proposal and [ORG PS  ] candidate 's commitment to implementing it if elected . 
End Comment . 
) [PER Hollande  ] added that the electoral program 's " social dimension " could help the [ORG PS  ] attract center-right " Gaullist voters " disaffected with the [ORG UMP  ] 's free-market liberalism . 
PREDICTS A ONE-ROUND PRIMARY ---------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Hollande  ] confidently predicted that the [ORG PS  ] would unify behind whoever wins the primary in the interest of victory -- though he conceded that primaries can sometimes weaken rather than strengthen a candidate . 
He defended the November date for party 's choosing of a candidate , saying that , had the candidate been chosen now , he/she would have been subjected to a potentially crippling drumbeat of criticism from the right . 
[PER Hollande  ] also confidently predicted that the [ORG PS  ] 's November primary would produce a clear cut winner , " probably in just one round . 
" [PER Hollande  ] said that , above all , party members " want a winner " and will therefore support the candidate most likely to beat [PER Sarkozy  ] in a putative , second round run-off . 
ROYAL ----- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Hollande  ] strongly implied that that candidate could easily be [PER Royal  ] , saying that if the primary were held today , " she will win and be the candidate , " barring a sharp downturn in her popularity in the pitiless triage of an intensifying presidential campaign . 
[PER Hollande  ] noted that [PER Royal  ] is not part of the traditional party establishment , and commented that the attacks against her have only served to make her all the more popular . 
Referring to her opponents among the socialists , [PER Hollande  ] said that those who resented her sudden success , and took cheap shots at her , were as a practical matter , " acting as her allies . 
" [PER Hollande  ] wondered out loud if her popularity would last , accurately identifying that as the key question about her candidacy . 
Several times he mentioned the unpredictability of politics , making clear that he believed much could happen between now and next May 's first round of the presidential election that could turn upside down " the givens of today . 
" In particular , [PER Hollande  ] evoked how a major international crisis -- he gave [LOC Iran  ] as an example -- might completely change the dynamics of the upcoming elections . 
CAREFUL NOT TO RULE OUT HIS OWN CANDIDACY ----------------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Hollande  ] was careful to make clear that he too was prepared to run as a unifying candidate , but only if it seemed to him he would be likely to win the party primary -- hands down in the first round . 
He was categorical in ruling out that that he would not/not run " out of pride " or " to get 10 percent of the vote . 
" ( Comment: Clearly , the only circumstances under which [PER Hollande  ] would be likely to win big in the primary , is if [PER Royal  ] for some reason drops out . 
End Comment . 
) [PER FABIUS  ] ------ <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Hollande  ] contrasted his " team player " attitude with what he dismissively called former prime minister [PER Laurent Fabius'  ] " accountant " mentality , saying , " just because 20 percent of the party supports him , he thinks that entitles him to 20 percent of whatever the party does . 
" Almost as an afterthought , [PER Hollande  ] added " no matter what , [PER Fabius  ] will run . 
" [LOC EUROPE  ] ------ <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Moscovici  ] said that a [ORG PS  ] administration would be much more pro-Europe than President [PER Chirac  ] and Prime Minister [PER de Villepin  ] ( see also reftel ) . 
Both [PER Hollande  ] and [PER Moscovici  ] saw a need to use [LOC Europe  ] to consolidate defense industries and reduce defense expenditures through economies of scale . 
[PER Hollande  ] noted sardonically that [LOC France  ] was unable to sell its fighters and tanks to anyone . 
[PER Moscovici  ] saw a need for an increased parliamentary role in policy-making related to [LOC Europe  ] , complaining that there was currently too much power concentrated in the presidency . 
[PER Hollande  ] described the absurd situation where the prime minister , who does not participate in [MISC European  ] Council meetings , represents the government during the question-and-answer sessions in the [ORG National Assembly  ] to defend policies set by the President . 
[PER Hollande  ] did not disagree with timeline set by [PER Chirac  ] and [MISC German  ] Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] for getting [LOC Europe  ] back on its feet in 2007-2008 , noting the importance of the [MISC Franco-German  ] tandem and saying that , if the effort failed , it would take another 4-5 years to come up with something new. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Both [PER Hollande  ] and [PER Moscovici  ] made clear they that they believed [PER Chirac  ] had no credibility for proposing anything now to advance the [MISC European  ] project , and both dismissed the idea that the rejected constitution could be subjected to a second referendum or , worse in their view , passed through parliament . 
[LOC Holland  ] and [PER Moscovici  ] agreed something new would be required " to get [LOC Europe  ] moving again , " but they had nothing specific to suggest . 
In the interim , [PER Moscovici  ] suggested , it might be possible to use [MISC Croatian  ] accession to introduce a few institutional reforms that could be approved by the parliaments of member states . 
[PER Hollande  ] dismissed [PER Sarkozy  ] 's ideas for having the six largest [ORG EU  ] members states play a leading role in setting policy , saying they were based on outmoded ideas of " great powers " setting policy for " little powers . 
" . 
[LOC FRANCE  ] ) [LOC U.S.  ] RELATIONS ----------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Hollande  ] gave a slightly different version of the argument we usually hear that , while the [MISC French  ] at a large disagree with the [LOC U.S.  ] intervention in [LOC Iraq  ] , [PER Chirac  ] and [PER Villepin  ] should nonetheless not have confronted the [LOC U.S.  ] so openly . 
[PER Hollande  ] argued that [PER Chirac  ] erred by not making it clear from the beginning how far he was prepared to go to oppose the [LOC U.S.  ] If [PER Chirac  ] had communicated more clearly how strongly he felt about the matter , it would not have led to the false impression that [LOC France  ] might come along in the end . 
[PER Moscovici  ] repeated his calls for dialogue aimed at attempting to find agreement when the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC France  ] should differ , adding that differences should be the exception and not the rule . 
[PER Hollande  ] said he wanted a [MISC French  ] foreign policy more firmly rooted in universal values , such as support for democracy , rather than the highly personalized approach which characterized the [PER Chirac  ] years . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) The are those among the [ORG PS  ] 's heavyweights , -- [MISC Strauss-Kahn  ] , [PER Fabius  ] and their supporters -- who believe that [PER Hollande  ] is subtly , successfully shaping developments so that the [ORG PS  ] candidate will wind up being either [PER Royal  ] or himself . 
Commentators and party insiders refer to this pair of possible outcomes as the " popularity " and " institutional " options . 
In the case of the first , [PER Royal  ] successfully uses her popularity with the public to impose herself on the party as its candidate . 
If , however , [PER Royal  ] and her popularity should for some reason falter , revealing a deeply splintered party with no attractive candidates ( the situation before her emergence as the clear front-runner ) , then the " institutional " option -- turning to the party leader to lead the party in the election -- could become a viable one .
