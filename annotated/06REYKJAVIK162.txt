( [ORG SBU  ] ) Since April post has regularly discussed the new [ORG UN Human Rights Council  ] ( refs A and B ) and [MISC Iranian  ] human rights violations ( refs C and D ) with [MISC Icelandic  ] MFA Minister Counselor [PER Nikulas Hannigan  ] , who is both the [ORG International Institutions  ] director and [LOC Middle East  ] director in [LOC Iceland  ] 's small MFA . 
[PER Hannigan  ] said it would be difficult for [LOC Iceland  ] to offer commitments concerning [MISC Icelandic  ] intentions with respect to the [ORG Human Rights Council  ] and related issues so long as the [LOC U.S.  ] does not explicitly name the states " that systematically abuse human rights " against which we say we wish to campaign . 
[ORG POLOFF  ] assured [PER Hannigan  ] that [LOC Iran  ] would be one such and encouraged him to draw additional conclusions based on country human rights practices on which we have demarched him in the past. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Hannigan  ] referred [ORG POLOFF  ] to Foreign Minister [PER Geir Haarde  ] 's April 6 foreign policy speech to [LOC Iceland  ] 's parliament , in which [PER Haarde  ] contended that " states which systematically violate their human rights commitments , or are subject to sanctions by the [ORG Security Council  ] as a result of human rights violations , should not be supported for a seat on the ( [ORG Human Rights ) Council  ] . 
" ( [PER Note: Haarde  ] also said that the [ORG Council  ] " did not entirely meet the expectations of the [MISC Icelandic  ] government " and that " ( l ) asting peace and security will only be established through effective democracy and respect for human rights and international human rights legislation . 
" End note . 
) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: [ORG Reykjavik  ] would be highly unlikely to vote for [MISC Iranian  ] membership on the [ORG Human Rights Council  ] . 
FM [PER Haarde  ] clearly shares our antipathy for state violators of human rights with pretensions to serve in the world 's most important new human rights institution . 
End comment .
