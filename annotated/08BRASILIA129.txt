( C ) Summary . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] Defense Minister [PER Nelson Jobim  ] told the Ambassador January 17 that he would like to sign a [ORG Defense Cooperation Agreement  ] ( [ORG DCA  ] , ref A ) when he visits [LOC Washington  ] in March , but that he faces stiff opposition in the [ORG Ministry of External Relations  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] or [ORG Itamaraty  ] ) . 
He briefed the Ambassador on his upcoming trip to [LOC France  ] and [LOC Russia  ] , and on his continuing work regarding civil aviation matters . 
The internal [ORG GOB  ] discussion on the merits of a [ORG DCA  ] will likely center on the message the [ORG GOB  ] thinks it will send regarding the nature of [LOC Brazil  ] 's relationship with the [LOC United States  ] . 
End summary . 
[ORG Defense Cooperation Agreement: The Battle  ] is Joined --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In a private breakfast on January 17 , the Ambassador told [PER Jobim  ] that his initial approach on a [ORG DCA  ] to [ORG MRE  ] Under Secretary for Political Affairs [PER Everton Vargas  ] had not been SIPDIS well received , and that [PER Vargas  ] had specifically mentioned Secretary General ( Vice Minister ) [PER Samuel Guimaraes  ] when SIPDIS asking for time to work the issue internally ( ref B ) . 
[PER Jobim  ] responded that [PER Guimaraes  ] posed a serious problem , not only on the [ORG DCA  ] but on a variety of issues . 
[PER Jobim  ] said that [PER Guimaraes  ] " hates the [LOC United States  ] " and is actively looking to create problems in the relationship . 
[PER Jobim  ] said that he has had to beat back more than one outlandish proposal by [PER Guimaraes  ] calculated to upset relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] and other industrialized countries. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Jobim  ] said that he would like to sign the [ORG DCA  ] when he travels to [LOC Washington  ] in March . 
[PER Guimaraes  ] has told him that cannot happen and is working hard to prevent the [ORG DCA  ] from being concluded . 
He argued that , as [PER Jobim  ] 's predecessor went to the [LOC United States  ] in 2007 , protocol demands a return visit by the [LOC U.S.  ] Defense Secretary . 
( Comment: Strictly speaking , this is not true , as the meeting between the [ORG SecDef  ] and [PER Jobim  ] 's predecessor was not part of an official counterpart visit . 
End comment . 
) He told [PER Jobim  ] that his trip would " mean nothing " compared with the symbolism of a visit by the [ORG SecDef  ] to [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[PER Jobim  ] said he pushed back , telling [PER Guimaraes  ] that " [ORG Itamaraty  ] is the process , " not the substance of engagement on his issues . 
But he told the Ambassador that he does not want to " win the battle and lose the war " and expend too much political capital on the [ORG DCA  ] , so will have to proceed carefully . 
In particular , he said , if [PER Guimaraes  ] and FM [ORG Amorim  ] join forces against a [ORG DCA  ] , that could be a serious problem . 
Submarines in [LOC France  ] , [LOC Helos  ] in [LOC Russia  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Jobim  ] told the Ambassador that the primary purpose of his upcoming trip to [LOC France  ] is to discuss design issues for a nuclear-powered submarine . 
He also said that he will look at [LOC France  ] 's [MISC Rafale  ] airplane . 
In [LOC Russia  ] [PER Jobim  ] 's primary purpose is to ensure servicing for [LOC Brazil  ] 's [MISC Russian  ] helicopters . 
He noted that [LOC Russia  ] wants to open a jeep facility in [LOC Porto Alegre  ] , and that he will travel to [LOC Russia  ] in an [ORG Embraer  ] plane in the hope of making sales there . 
[ORG Civil Aviation: Engaged  ] on Latest Problems ------------------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( SBU ) [PER Jobim  ] told the Ambassador that he believes he has found options for avoiding the proposed draconian increase in landing fees at [LOC Sao Paulo  ] 's [LOC Guarulhos  ] airport ( ref C ) , especially as they can have another apron ready quickly . 
He asked for another few weeks to work the issue . 
Discussing [LOC Brazil  ] 's airport operator [LOC Infraero  ] , he said that the current management problems are so big that more time will be needed before he can consider opening it up to foreign investors. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Jobim  ] 's candid comments on [PER Guimaraes  ] confirm similar messages from [PER U/S Vargas  ] and [ORG Long-Term Planning BRASILIA  ] 00000129 002 OF 002 Minister [PER Roberto Unger  ] ( ref B ) regarding the difficult internal battle in the [ORG GOB  ] that will surround the proposal for a [ORG DCA  ] with the [LOC United States  ] . 
As he has since the beginning of his tenure , [PER Jobim  ] continues to challenge the historic supremacy of [ORG Itamaraty  ] in all areas of foreign policy . 
President [PER Lula  ] 's direction to [PER Jobim  ] to postpone his visit to [LOC Washington  ] ( initially planned for January ) until he had met with his [MISC Latin American  ] counterparts was almost certainly provided on the basis of input from [ORG Itamaraty  ] and presidential foreign policy advisor [PER Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] . 
In the same way , the merits of a [ORG DCA  ] are likely to be considered by the [ORG GOB  ] at least in part in light of the message it will convey regarding the nature of [LOC Brazil  ] 's relationship with the [LOC United States  ] . 
Once again , President [PER Lula  ] may have to play the deciding role between an unusually activist Defense Minister interested in developing closer ties with the [LOC United States  ] and an [ORG MRE  ] that is firmly committed to maintaining control over all aspects of foreign policy and to keeping a measure of distance between [LOC Brazil  ] and the [LOC United States  ] .
