( [ORG S/NF  ] ) SUMMARY . 
[ORG Counterterrorism Coordinator  ] Ambassador [PER Dell Dailey  ] led an interagency delegation to [LOC Madrid  ] on September 21 for meetings with [MISC Spanish  ] security , law enforcement , diplomatic and intelligence officials to discuss the evolving threat from Al-Qaida to [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC European  ] interests and to explore ways to strengthen our already excellent bilateral counterterrorism ( [LOC CT  ] ) cooperation . 
Our [MISC Spanish  ] counterparts expressed appreciation for the intelligence briefing provided by the [ORG NCTC  ] representative and said that the threat from terrorism--specifically emanating from the [LOC Maghreb  ] and [LOC Sahel  ] regions of [LOC North Africa--represents  ] the most important priority for the [MISC Spanish  ] government . 
[MISC Spanish  ] security and intelligence services have increased their focus on [LOC North Africa  ] in recent years , and Deputy Interior Minister [PER Camacho  ] said he would like to explore ways to include the [LOC U.S.  ] in joint efforts with [LOC Spain  ] and its southern [MISC European  ] allies aimed at stemming the terrorist threat from that region . 
At a roundtable with senior intelligence and security officials , our [MISC Spanish  ] hosts emphasized the close cooperation with [ORG USG  ] counterparts , but recognized that it was a challenge for [MISC Spanish  ] services to break down their own internal stovepipes . 
The delegation also met with a small group of [MISC Spanish  ] legislators to explain the [ORG RSI  ] concept and the need for close international cooperation on [LOC CT  ] issues . 
Ambassador [PER Dailey  ] acknowledged the important role of legislators in the fight against terrorism , and encouraged them to push for strong anti-terror legislation that punishes recruitment , financing and document forgery . 
Both sides agreed to continue a dialogue and sharing of best practices . 
They also agreed the [MISC Embassy  ] will continue to serve as the liaison between [MISC Spanish  ] [LOC CT  ] officials and S/CT . 
The visit ended with a television interview given by Ambassador [PER Dailey  ] on the [MISC Spanish  ] business and political cable channel [LOC Intereconomia  ] , during which he stressed that bilateral [LOC CT  ] cooperation was " very , very good . 
" After discussions between Ambassador [PER Dailey  ] , the [MISC Washington-based  ] interagency delegation , the Charge d'Affaires , and our interagency [MISC Embassy  ] team , we believe there are areas for immediate follow up coming out of this visit to maintain the momentum on [LOC US-Spain  ] bilateral [LOC CT  ] cooperation ( see paragraph 11 ) . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Ambassador [PER Dailey  ] 's visit to [LOC Madrid  ] is part of a [ORG National Security Council  ] strategy to brief key [MISC European  ] partners on the significant and emerging threats to our mutual security interests and discuss ways to strengthen our cooperation to thwart these threats . 
The delegations are led by Ambassador [PER Dailey  ] and are also an important opportunity for him to explain his role and mission as coordinator for [ORG USG  ] international [LOC CT  ] policy , and propose areas for strengthened [LOC CT  ] cooperation . 
The delegation included [PER Michael Leiter  ] , [ORG NCTC  ] Principal Deputy Director ; [PER Marisa Lino  ] , [ORG DHS  ] Assistant Secretary for the [ORG Office of International Affairs  ] ; [PER Arthur Cummings  ] , [ORG FBI  ] Deputy Assistant Director ; [PER Elizabeth Farr  ] , [ORG NSC Office  ] Director ; [PER Jessie Liu  ] , [ORG DOJ  ] Counsel to the Deputy Attorney General ; and [PER Marc Norman  ] , S/CT Deputy Director . 
The delegation began the day with a briefing from the [MISC Embassy  ] 's [ORG Counterterrorism Working Group  ] , where they heard that [MISC Spanish  ] government officials at the highest level have made clear to us their desire to coordinate closely on [LOC CT  ] , which they broadly view as a shared threat . 
However , bureaucratic obstacles still remain an impediment to improved cooperation , and [MISC Spanish  ] inter-service rivalries probably will continue to hinder bilateral information sharing in the near future. //MEETING WITH [MISC SPANISH  ] LEGISLATORS// <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) Ambassador [PER Dailey  ] met with congressmen from [LOC Spain  ] 's leading parties , the [ORG PSOE  ] ( [ORG Spanish Socialist Workers Party  ] ) , and the [ORG PP  ] ( [ORG Popular Party  ] ) , along with a member of the [ORG PNV MADRID  ] 00002023 002.2 OF 005 ( [ORG Basque Nationalist Party  ] ) . 
He explained the purpose of his visit to [LOC Europe  ] , emphasized our appreciation for existing bilateral cooperation , and expressed a desire to explore further ways to collaborate against terrorism . 
All three legislators stressed the importance of bilateral [LOC CT  ] cooperation and pledged to do their part to encourage their colleagues to provide continued support . 
Ambassador [PER Dailey  ] explained the [ORG RSI  ] concept and said that legislators were extremely important in the fight against terrorism . 
He encouraged them to push for strong anti-terror legislation that punishes recruitment , financing and document forgery. //INTERIOR MINISTRY SEES AREAS FOR COOPERATION ON NORTH AFRICAN THREAT// <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Ambassador [PER Dailey  ] , accompanied by the Charge and [ORG DHS A/S  ] [PER Lino  ] , paid an office call on Secretary of State for Security [PER Antonio Camacho  ] ( Deputy Interior Minister equivalent ) . 
[PER Camacho  ] is a valued interlocutor and has told us before that whatever policy differences that might exist between us on other levels , the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Spain  ] see eye-to-eye in the area of counterterrorism . 
He said his government 's main [LOC CT  ] concern was from [MISC Islamic  ] extremism , despite the nearly 40-year battle the GOS has waged with the [MISC Basque  ] terrorist group [ORG ETA  ] . 
[PER Camacho  ] stressed his government 's concern over the threat emanating from [LOC North Africa  ] , specifically the [LOC Maghreb  ] and [LOC Sahel  ] regions , and described steps [LOC Spain  ] has taken to work with [LOC Morocco  ] and [LOC Algeria  ] to improve their capabilities . 
[PER Camacho  ] said that in his view , [LOC Morocco  ] " gets it , " but that the [MISC Algerian  ] government still has progress to make . 
[PER Camacho  ] also told Ambassador Daily about joint efforts [LOC Spain  ] is undertaking with [LOC France  ] and [LOC Italy  ] to focus on the [ORG Southern Europe-North Africa  ] corridor of terrorist movement , recruiting , and facilitating . 
Ambassador [PER Dailey  ] responded that the [LOC U.S.  ] had expressed interest in the past in joining some of these efforts and was willing to serve as an observer or in any way we could be helpful . 
[PER Camacho  ] said emphatically that he was interested in the direct and active participation of the [LOC U.S.  ] and would like to examine possibilities for cooperation in the months to come , focusing on the [LOC Sahel  ] as an axis of terrorism , drug and human trafficking , and illegal immigration . 
Ambassador [PER Dailey  ] briefed [PER Camacho  ] on the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership  ] involving entities of [ORG DHS  ] , State , Justice and [ORG DOD.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Camacho  ] told [PER Dailey  ] that just days earlier he had signed with Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] the information-sharing protocol covering terrorist lookout information as envisioned in [ORG Homeland Security Presidential Directive Six  ] ( [MISC HSPD-6  ] ) . 
He said the [ORG HSPD-6  ] " [MISC Madrid Model  ] " should be just that , a tool to be used by our countries and eventually with others as a model for tracking and stopping the flow of individuals with the intent to harm [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] interests . 
A/S [PER Lino  ] broached the subject of [MISC DHS/CBP  ] officers possibly assisting [MISC Spanish  ] airport authorities with document checks and other passenger monitoring . 
[PER Camacho  ] seemed open to the idea , and became even more interested when told that the [LOC U.S.  ] had run similar successful programs in [LOC Japan  ] and the [LOC UK  ] . 
Ambassador [PER Dailey  ] ended the meeting by stressing the importance of sharing [LOC CT  ] best practices through exchanges between the [MISC Embassy  ] and the [MISC Spanish  ] MFA , and extended on behalf of the [MISC Danish  ] government an invitation to attend a conference on radicalization to be held later this year in [LOC Denmark.  ] //SPAIN'S [ORG NCTC  ] DISCUSSES THE CHALLENGE OF STOVEPIPES AND INFORMATION SHARING// <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The interagency delegation , accompanied by Mission elements from [LOC POL  ] , [ORG ORA  ] , and [PER Legatt  ] , engaged in a substantive roundtable discussion with senior [MISC Spanish  ] intelligence and security officials at [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG NCTC  ] equivalent , known as the [ORG CNCA  ] . 
[ORG CNCA  ] Director [PER Eugenio Pereiro  ] chaired the meeting and began the discussion by mentioning the importance of regular communication between [ORG NCTC  ] and the [ORG CNCA  ] . 
[LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG CNCA  ] has been in existence for less then three years and was established in the wake of the [LOC Madrid  ] train bombings on March [ORG MADRID  ] 00002023 003.2 OF 005 11 , 2004 . 
[PER Pereiro  ] said [LOC Spain  ] was well aware of its precarious position between [LOC North Africa  ] and the [MISC European  ] heartland and said it was therefore vital to combine resources with the [LOC U.S.  ] and explore further avenues for bilateral cooperation . 
He quickly added that [MISC Spanish  ] intelligence and law enforcement agencies had yet to break down their own internal stovepipes , and that would prove to be every bit as challenging as improving information-sharing with the [LOC U.S.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Pereiro  ] fully understands the importance of interagency cooperation , and he assembled for the roundtable senior officials from [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG National Police  ] , [ORG Civil Guard  ] , and [ORG National Intelligence Center--Spanish  ] agencies who rarely meet among themselves . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] delegation listened to all sides and then made a plea for more information sharing--especially early on in an investigation before a [LOC U.S.  ] nexus has been established--and pledged that we would do what we could to ensure the same . 
The main conclusion from the meeting was that we would continue to use the [MISC Embassy  ] as a focal point to drive closer cooperation and streamline information flows. //THE PERSPECTIVE FROM THE [MISC SPANISH  ] MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS// <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [MISC Spanish  ] Ministry of [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] hosted the delegation at the [LOC Palacio de  ] [PER Santa Cruz  ] , where Director General for [ORG Counterterrorism ( A/S  ] equivalent ) [PER Angel Lossada  ] agreed with our assessment that [ORG Al-Qaida  ] in the [MISC Islamic  ] [LOC Maghreb  ] ( [ORG AQIM  ] ) is gaining strength in [LOC North Africa  ] . 
He added however that although [ORG AQIM  ] might be gaining in logistical strength and potential lethality , his ministry did not see any swelling of public or political support . 
He said there may be ways therefore of working with the [MISC Moroccan  ] and [MISC Algerian  ] governments to further isolate the terrorist group and drive a wedge between it and the local population . 
[PER Lossada  ] said that terrorist groups such as these can only offer " imaginary victories " through their terrorist acts and that it is up to western governments to counter this radicalization . 
A/S [PER Lino  ] raised [LOC U.S.  ] concerns that the new [ORG EU  ] draft framework agreement for data protection ( specifically Articles 14 and 27 ) create new obstacles to improved information sharing , and solicited the [MISC Spanish  ] government 's views on the agreement . 
[PER Lossada  ] tasked his staff to review the articles and look into the matter further . 
Ambassador [PER Dailey  ] reviewed for [PER Lossada  ] the comments made earlier in the day by Deputy Interior Minister [PER Camacho  ] regarding a role for the [LOC U.S.  ] to play with its [ORG Southern European  ] allies and [PER Lossada  ] also agreed this was a good idea . 
Ambassador [PER Dailey  ] requested the [MISC Spanish  ] provide a list of best practices on preventing [MISC Muslim  ] radicalization . 
He said the [LOC U.S.  ] was making the same request of several countries and plans to assemble the responses ( without reference to which country provided them ) and share them with nations concerned with the subject. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Talk on further [MISC U.S.-Spain  ] cooperation on the terrorist threat from [LOC North Africa  ] carried over to a working lunch hosted by the Charge , whose guest list included MFA DG [PER Lossada  ] and [ORG CNCA  ] Director [PER Pereiro  ] , in addition to [PER Joan Mesquida  ] , Director of the [ORG Unified Command  ] of the [ORG National Police  ] and [ORG Civil Guard  ] ; Judge [PER Javier Gomez-Bermudez  ] , Presiding Magistrate over the trials of the March 11 , 2004 bombings ( currently in deliberations ) ; [PER Miguel Valverde  ] , Chief of the [LOC Comisaria General de Informacion  ] ; and [PER Susana Peri  ] , Sub-Secretary for Justice . 
The lunch was thoughtful and reflective , and guests provided candid thoughts on ways that two countries with different government and judicial systems can better cooperate in countering the amorphous threat of [MISC Islamic  ] radical terrorism . 
[PER Mesquida  ] reiterated [LOC Spain  ] 's commitment to effective [LOC CT  ] cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] Judge [PER Gomez-Bermudez  ] provided rather pointed observations that [ORG Al-Qaida  ] cannot beat us if we have the patience to defeat it . 
However , he posited that AQ had more patience than we in the [LOC West  ] , and that this will need to be a sustained global effort over many generations . 
He warned against a " trashing of our [ORG MADRID  ] 00002023 004.2 OF 005 democratic system " in the fight against terrorism and said that if we allow this to happen , then " the terrorists have won . 
" There was considerable discussion of [LOC Spain  ] 's counterterrorism laws , and the advantages they offered [MISC Spanish  ] authorities ( e.g. criminalizing membership in a terrorist organization even without any overt act of support ) . //THE ROAD AHEAD - AREAS FOR FOLLOW-UP// <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [LOC U.S.  ] delegation 's meetings with senior officials in [LOC Spain  ] 's security , law enforcement , diplomatic and intelligence services highlighted the current strength of our bilateral [LOC CT  ] cooperation . 
However , as all of the interlocutors noted , there is always room for improvement . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] would certainly welcome any additional intelligence and law enforcement information on specific security threats to the [LOC Iberian Peninsula  ] . 
Ambassador [PER Dailey  ] emphasized to his [MISC Spanish  ] interlocutors the importance of ensuring that all future cooperation efforts be run through [ORG Embassy Madrid  ] to build on the close working relationships we have been able to establish . 
Counterterrorism is the highest priority of this Mission , from the Ambassador on down , and we will maintain close contact with [LOC Washington  ] agencies to coordinate future efforts . 
After discussions between the Charge d'Affaires , Ambassador [PER Dailey  ] , and our interagency team , we believe there are several areas for immediate follow up that can come out of this visit . 
We would appreciate feedback and guidance on our proposed suggestions for maintaining momentum on [LOC US-Spain  ] bilateral [LOC CT  ] cooperation . 
-- [ORG Southern Europe/North Africa  ] . 
We would like to soon follow up with the [MISC Spanish  ] on concrete proposals for cooperation on initiatives to counter the terror threat emanating from [LOC North Africa  ] . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] indicated to Ambassador [PER Dailey  ] a willingness to weigh in on our behalf with their [MISC European  ] allies , specifically [LOC France  ] and [LOC Italy  ] , to see if we might gain a seat at the table ( even if only as an observer ) to discuss regional strategies on [LOC North Africa  ] . 
We would be happy to take back to the [MISC Spanish  ] any specific proposals S/CT might envision . 
-- [ORG HSPD-6 Protocol  ] . 
After almost a year of negotiations and fine-tuning the mechanics of the information-sharing protocol , we cleared a major hurdle with the September 17 signing . 
However , implementation is the key to moving forward and we hope that the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Terrorist Screening Center  ] will use the 90-day implementation period to iron out any final issues that might hinder the free flow of information on known or suspected terrorists . 
We will work closely with [MISC Spanish  ] officials in the [ORG CNCA  ] to make sure they make the best use of the 90-day window . 
We stand ready to assist as needed in bringing the two parties together . 
-- Data sharing . 
There are significant concerns that the new [ORG EU  ] draft framework agreement for data protection ( specifically Articles 14 and 27 ) create new obstacles to improved information sharing . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] delegation solicited the [MISC Spanish  ] government 's views on the agreement . 
If [LOC Washington  ] agencies can provide background on this issue expressing specific concerns and issues for the future , [ORG Post  ] can follow up with the MFA . 
-- Radicalization . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] are worried that their [MISC Muslim  ] immigrant population is prone to radicalization and our counterparts tell us that [MISC Spanish  ] prisons have become hotbeds of budding Jihadist activity . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] appeared receptive to the [MISC Danish  ] invitation to attend a conference on radicalization later this year , and we believe that they would be equally receptive to any advice or guidance we could provide from experiences integrating our own [MISC Muslim  ] populations to encourage the [MISC Spanish  ] to think about this problem in new ways . 
[ORG Post  ] will coordinate with [ORG Embassy Copenhagen  ] to make sure that a formal invitation is extended and ensure [MISC Spanish  ] participation to the extent possible . 
-- Offer of assistance at [MISC Spanish  ] airports . 
[ORG DHS/CBP  ] has offered to assist [MISC Spanish  ] airport authorities with document [ORG MADRID  ] 00002023 005.2 OF 005 checks and other passenger monitoring , and Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] raised this issue during September consultations in [LOC Washington  ] . 
With background on this program and specific offers of assistance from [ORG DHS/CBP  ] , [ORG Post  ] can raise this issue with the [ORG GOS  ] at a higher level . 
We would accept a 90-day TDY to start , but if successful , we would request a [MISC NSDD-38  ] and a permanent position , not a succession of [LOC TDYers.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 .
