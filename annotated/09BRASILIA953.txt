Reasons: 1.4 ( B and D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In a July 27 farewell call on [MISC Brazilian  ] President [PER Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  ] , bookended by warm personal discussions with [PER Barbara  ] and me , [PER Lula  ] reflected at length and with great intensity on [LOC Brazil  ] 's role in the region and its implications for [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] relations . 
He believes the [LOC United States  ] still has significant problems with its image and relationship in the hemisphere , but that President [PER Obama  ] might be able to overcome these problems . 
Just back from a [ORG MERCOSUL Summit  ] in [LOC Paraguay  ] , [PER Lula  ] mused that , even though there are problems in the region--he mentioned [LOC Bolivia  ] 's [PER Evo Morales  ] , in particular--it is a " peaceful region , " and " [LOC Brazil  ] is a peaceful country . 
" Although government bureaucracy often makes relations difficult , he said , he has ensured that [LOC Brazil  ] maintains a strong preference for accommodating its neighbors ; the recent agreement with [LOC Paraguay  ] on selling [MISC Itaipu  ] electricity is an example of this . 
( Comment: We understand that presidential foreign policy advisor [PER Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] overruled objections to the deal by the [ORG Ministry of External Relations  ] , a dynamic we have often seen at play with regard to regional relations . 
End Comment . 
) <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Lula  ] told me that his vision is for [LOC Brazil  ] to be the fifth largest economy within a decade . 
[LOC France  ] 's President [PER Sarkozy  ] understands this , he said , and has offered to build their fighter in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
He contrasted this attitude with that of the [LOC United States  ] , which refused to allow [LOC Brazil  ] to sell [MISC Super Tucanos  ] to [LOC Venezuela  ] , opening the door to outside--Russian and Chinese--influence there . 
[LOC Brazil  ] needs the tools to deal with its neighbors , [PER Lula  ] said . 
If [LOC Bolivia  ] wants [MISC Super Tucanos  ] , [PER Lula  ] needs to be able to sell them . 
[LOC Brazil  ] can't afford the type of embarrassment caused by not being able to sell [MISC Super Tucanos  ] to [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
[PER Lula  ] said he understood the importance of the [MISC FX-2  ] fighter sale to the [LOC United States  ] , and if the meetings between [MISC NSA General Jones  ] and his counterparts in [LOC Brazil  ] go well , [PER Lula  ] will look to re-engage President [PER Obama  ] on the matter . 
However , he offered no assurances regarding the sale. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Lula  ] said that , although he and President [PER Bush  ] had an excellent relationship , [PER Bush  ] " could never bring the [ORG State Department  ] along in the relationship " and this continues to be a problem even now between our bureaucracies . 
Stressing that much had already been accomplished to strengthen our bilateral relationship , he focused on the need to build trust , saying he hopes that the [LOC United States  ] will continue to work with [LOC Brazil  ] and will become an even better friend and ally of [LOC Brazil.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Comment: This farewell call provided singular insight into the complexity and tension in [PER Lula  ] , s thinking on foreign relations . 
Warm , personable , and engaging at the beginning and end of the meeting , he carried on an intense , almost harsh monologue in the middle . 
Unusually , he insisted that only his own interpreter , [PER Barbara  ] , and I participate , and I believe the fact that he granted the meeting*not standard for departing ambassadors*reflects the importance he attaches to the relationship with the [LOC United States  ] , particularly at this moment . 
At the same time , his focus on leaders*Morales , [PER Sarkozy  ] , [PER Obama*and  ] his negative view of bureaucracy provided a clear demonstration of the importance [PER Lula  ] attaches to personal relationships in the conduct of foreign policy. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( SBU ) Comment , continued: With our meeting coming on the heels of a difficult [ORG MERCOSUL  ] summit--a contact present at the gathering characterized it as a &dialogue of the deaf , 8 signaling [ORG MERCOSUL  ] had reached its limit as an integration mechanism--the tension was palpable , as a clearly troubled [PER Lula  ] reflected on his role as a guarantor of stability in [LOC South America  ] , his desire to have a closer relationship with President [PER Obama  ] and the new [ORG U.S. Administration  ] , and his ultimate goal of having [LOC Brazil  ] recognized as a major world power .
