Anthony Wayne  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) As discussed in reftel , information strongly suggests [LOC Afghanistan  ] 's [ORG New Ansari  ] hawala network is facilitating bribes and other wide-scale illicit cash transfers for corrupt [MISC Afghan  ] officials and is providing illicit financial services for narco-traffickers , insurgents , and criminals through an array of front companies in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and the [MISC UAE.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) Headquartered in [LOC Kabul  ] , the [ORG New Ansari  ] hawala network has connections to [LOC Dubai  ] and other global financial markets . 
Law enforcement and other components in [ORG Mission Afghanistan  ] and [ORG ISAF  ] have been investigating [ORG New Ansari  ] and briefed [LOC Washington  ] agencies in a September 8 SVTC . 
As noted in ref , moving forward against [ORG New Ansari  ] requires an interagency approach here in country as well as in [LOC Washington  ] . 
Such efforts will need to include better organizing and resourcing USG efforts to identify and disrupt financial linkages in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and in key regional financial hubs. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) Embassy would appreciate a response to the requests for additional resources/support contained in reftel . 
These include the need to fully staff the [MISC Afghan  ] Threat Finance Cell ( [ORG ATFC  ] ) -- the total number of positions required is 49 , but only 22 of those positions are filled . 
Moreover , a higher percentage of those slots should be filled with more senior and experienced interagency analysts and at least one public corruption prosecutor . 
The [ORG ATFC  ] also urgently requires access to translators who can accurately and quickly process an increasing amount of wire intercept information , including complex technical and financial records . 
In addition , the current split in the [ORG ATFC  ] between [LOC Bagram Airfield  ] and [LOC Kabul  ] should be minimized . 
To integrate the [ORG ATFC  ] better into broader intelligence analysis efforts , it would be advisable to establish a lead base of operations in [LOC Kabul  ] . 
The [ORG ATFC  ] would continue to forward deploy liaison staff at each regional command to ensure country-wide coverage. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG Mission  ] appreciates [LOC Washington  ] agencies' consideration and support of these requests . 
We look forward to a rapid response .
