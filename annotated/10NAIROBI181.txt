( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary: [ORG China’s  ] engagement in [LOC Kenya  ] continues to grow exponentially . 
[LOC China  ] enjoys a large trade surplus with [LOC Kenya  ] ; exports increased by more than 25 percent a year from 2004 to 2008 . 
The [ORG China National Offshore Oil Company  ] ( [ORG CNOOC  ] ) is drilling for oil in the [LOC Isiolo  ] region . 
[LOC China  ] may be a potential partner in the development of the new mega-port at [LOC Lamu  ] . 
In addition , [LOC China  ] is heavily involved in various infrastructure projects across [LOC Kenya  ] primarily with roads . 
[LOC China  ] is also providing weapons to the [ORG GOK  ] in support of its [LOC Somalia  ] policies and increasing their involvement with the [ORG Kenyan National Security and Intelligence Service  ] ( [ORG NSIS  ] ) by providing telecommunications and computer equipment . 
Recently , [LOC China  ] signed an economic and technical cooperation agreement with the [ORG GOK  ] providing new development grants . 
To date , [LOC China  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] do not collaborate on development projects in [LOC Kenya  ] . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) [LOC China  ] enjoys a large trade surplus with [LOC Kenya  ] , exporting more than 30 times its imports . 
For 2008 , [LOC China  ] exported $917 million of goods to [LOC Kenya  ] while [LOC China  ] imported $29 million worth of [MISC Kenyan  ] goods . 
[ORG China’s  ] exports in 2008 grew by 39 percent over 2007 capping the fourth straight year of at least 25 percent export growth , including a 54 percent increase in 2007 and a 79 percent increase in 2005 . 
[LOC China  ] is now the third largest exporter to [LOC Kenya  ] after the [LOC United Arab Emirates  ] , which principally exports oil to [LOC Kenya  ] , and [LOC India  ] . 
In comparison , the [LOC U.S.  ] exported $440 million worth of goods to [LOC Kenya  ] in 2008 while importing $343 million worth of [MISC Kenyan  ] goods. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) The [ORG CNOOC  ] is drilling for oil in the [LOC Isiolo  ] region of [LOC Kenya  ] ( see ref A ) . 
The exploratory well will cost $26 million dollars and drilling will be complete in April 2010 . 
Numerous oil companies have drilled 31 exploratory wells in [LOC Kenya  ] over the last 50 years without success . 
However , [ORG CNOOC  ] is making a credible effort to find oil in an area geologically similar to [LOC Southern Sudan  ] , with its substantial oil finds . 
As reported ref A , we had heard that [ORG CNOOC  ] would announce results from the exploratory well by January 2010 ; we are now hearing an announcement may come in April. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) The [ORG GOK  ] is highly interested in developing a major port complex in [LOC Lamu  ] , which has much greater potential as a deep water port than [LOC Mombasa  ] . 
The [ORG GOK  ] originally held discussions with [LOC Qatar  ] over the development of the [LOC Lamu  ] port in return for a substantial allocation of farm land . 
Negotiations involving development of the [LOC Lamu  ] port reportedly occur inside the “black box” of President Kibaki’s inner circle at State House . 
We understand , however , that talks with [LOC Qatar  ] are off , and that the [MISC Chinese  ] are in play as a potential partner for the port development project and associated regional infrastructure ( road and rail infrastructure to [LOC Southern Sudan  ] and [LOC Ethiopia  ] , and pipeline infrastructure to [LOC Southern Sudan  ] and [LOC Uganda  ] ) . 
[ORG China’s  ] interest in the [LOC Lamu  ] project is reportedly linked to the presence of oil in [LOC Southern Sudan  ] and [LOC Uganda  ] which could be exported via [LOC Lamu  ] as well as the greater export potential to [LOC Ethiopia  ] , [LOC Southern Sudan  ] and [LOC Uganda  ] . 
The addition of oil from [LOC Isiolo  ] would add additional impetus to [ORG China’s  ] interest in the port development which is estimated to cost more than $5 billion. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( SBU ) [LOC China  ] is currently developing a number of infrastructure projects in [LOC Kenya  ] . 
Currently , [LOC China  ] [MISC Wuyi  ] , [ORG Syno Hydro  ] , and [ORG China Overseas Engineering Corporation  ] are working on the [LOC Thika Road  ] project , a major eight lane highway from [LOC Nairobi  ] to [LOC Thika  ] town . 
Another [MISC Chinese  ] firm , [ORG Shengli Engineering & Consulting Company  ] was the prime contractor for the [MISC Mombasa-City Centre-Gigiri  ] road upgrade project . 
In addition , the second phase of a project to upgrade the [PER Jomo Kenyatta International Airport  ] ( [ORG JKIA  ] ) is being worked by [ORG China National Aero-Technology International Engineering Company  ] ( [ORG CATIC  ] ) . 
The first phase of the project was completed by the [MISC Chinese  ] company , [ORG China Wu Yi  ] . 
[ORG TBEA International  ] , another [MISC Chinese  ] firm , is developing a 120 MW thermal plant in [LOC Longonot  ] and 600 MW coal-fired power station in [LOC Mombasa  ] as an independent power producer . 
[ORG TBEA  ] is also undertaking projects that involve construction of 132 kV lines and sub-stations in the [LOC Rift Valley  ] , [LOC Central  ] , [MISC Western  ] and [MISC Coast  ] provinces . 
During a recent visit to the [LOC Olkaria  ] geothermal development site in the [LOC Rift Valley Province  ] , [PER Econoff  ] observed that [ORG Great Wall Drilling  ] , another [MISC Chinese  ] company , was exploring for geothermal energy . 
The [ORG KenGen Olkaria Geothermal Development Manager  ] told [PER Econoff  ] that while he would prefer to buy quality [MISC American  ] drills , pipes , and other geothermal-related products , [MISC American  ] companies could not compete with [LOC China  ] on price and price won every time in [LOC Kenya.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In January 2010 , the [ORG GOK  ] received from the [ORG GOC  ] via [ORG CATIC  ] weapons , ammunition , supplies , and textiles for making uniforms in support of the [LOC GOK’s Jubaland  ] initiative. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) As of late August 2009 , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] awarded [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] a contract to provide landline telephone monitoring equipment to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] awarded the contract to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] after being pressured to do so by [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ’s preference for is based on kickbacks he received [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] while on a visit to [LOC China  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] received monthly payments of over $5000 from [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] which were used to pay medical bills. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) As of September 2008 , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] As of early March 2009 , [MISC Chinese  ] technicians were working on a project in the basement of the [ORG NSIS  ] headquarters . 
The presence of the technicians was well known throughout the [ORG NSIS  ] and was causing some concern over the level of cooperation between the [ORG NSIS  ] and its [MISC Chinese  ] counterparts. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) The [ORG GOK  ] and [ORG GOC  ] recently signed an Economic and [ORG Technical Cooperation Agreement  ] . 
The agreement provides a $7.3 million grant from [LOC China  ] to [LOC Kenya  ] . 
Of the grant , $150,000 will finance a computer program for the [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] while the remaining funds can be used by the [ORG GOK  ] to fund development projects of their choice . 
The agreement also covered [MISC Chinese  ] funding of feasibility studies for the potential development of [LOC Lamu  ] port . 
In addition , [LOC China  ] committed to funding portions of the [LOC Northern Corridor  ] road project , which links [LOC Mombasa  ] and [LOC Nairobi  ] to [LOC Ethiopia  ] and [LOC Southern Sudan  ] , as well as parts of the new [MISC Mombasa-Kampala  ] standard gauge railway . 
Currently , [ORG China’s Shengli Engineering Construction  ] is refurbishing The [ORG Moi International Sports Complex  ] at [LOC Kasarani  ] with $12.8 million of grant-in-aid money from [LOC China  ] . 
In Early 2009 , [LOC China  ] provided a $1 million grant to the [ORG GOK  ] for the construction of a 100 bed hospital in [LOC Nairobi  ] . 
In 2008 , the [ORG GOK  ] received approximately $381 million in interest-free and preferential loans , with $145 million intended for the planned ring roads aimed at decongesting [LOC Nairobi  ] . 
Since 2008 , the [ORG GOK  ] has implemented campaigns to attract investment from the $1 billion [ORG China-Africa Development Fund.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) [ORG China’s  ] companies working in [LOC Kenya  ] tend to import a substantial number of [MISC Chinese  ] workers . 
This importation of labor from [LOC China  ] tends to limit the number of [MISC Kenyans  ] who directly benefit with wages and knowledge transfer from the projects . 
The low [MISC Chinese  ] bids on major projects also push local firms out of the process , especially in infrastructure areas where capacity building of local firms would be useful . 
In addition , the [ORG Kenya Wildlife Service  ] ( [ORG KWS  ] ) noticed a marked increase in poaching wherever [MISC Chinese  ] labor camps were located and in fact set up specific interdiction efforts aimed to reduce poaching ( see ref B ) . 
[ORG KWS  ] also reports that 90% of the ivory smugglers detained at [ORG JKIA  ] are [MISC Chinese  ] nationals. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) The [LOC U.S.  ] mission in [LOC Kenya  ] has no current or pending development partnership arrangements with the [ORG GOC  ] or any informal collaboration at the program or project level . 
The [ORG GOC  ] does not participate in donor coordination in [LOC Kenya  ] . 
Donors have encouraged the [ORG GOK  ] to bring [LOC China  ] into the donor coordination process , but no progress has been made to date . 
While we do not recommend it , a potential area for collaboration could include agricultural development , a [ORG USG  ] strength and an area of [MISC Chinese  ] interest in [LOC Africa  ] . 
However , the [ORG GOC  ] does not participate in the multilateral agricultural donors group in [LOC Kenya  ] . 
The [ORG GOC  ] could be invited to join this donors group , predicated on their willingness to sign a Memorandum of Understanding ensuring their support of [MISC Kenya’s  ] long term agriculture strategy . 
The [ORG World Bank  ] recently announced a new initiative to work in cooperation with [MISC Chinese  ] infrastructure development in [LOC Africa  ] . 
This new effort seems to be aimed at working with [LOC China  ] and [MISC African  ] countries to maximize the benefits of [MISC Chinese  ] development aid to the [MISC African  ] people. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( SBU ) Comment: Collaboration between the [ORG USG  ] and [LOC China  ] in [LOC Kenya  ] should be approached cautiously as there appears to be little dovetailing of our interests to date . 
The [ORG GOC  ] has been silent on the implementation of the reform agenda , which we consider essential to [MISC Kenya’s  ] future stability and prosperity ; the [ORG GOC  ] turns a blind eye to the flooding of the [MISC Kenyan  ] market with [MISC Chinese  ] counterfeit goods , such as batteries , which directly damage [LOC U.S.  ] market share here ; and the [ORG GOC  ] has not demonstrated any commitment to curb ivory poaching . 
We expect [ORG China’s  ] engagement in [LOC Kenya  ] to continue to grow given [MISC Kenya’s  ] strategic location . 
If oil or gas is found in [LOC Kenya  ] , this engagement will likely grow even faster . 
[MISC Kenya’s  ] leadership may be tempted to move ever closer to [LOC China  ] in an effort to shield itself from [MISC Western  ] , and principally [LOC U.S.  ] , pressure to reform . 
Given the possibility of a backlash by the [MISC Kenyan  ] people against [LOC China  ] , perhaps over the issue of imported [MISC Chinese  ] labor or mishandling of natural resources , there may be benefits to keeping our distance , at least publicly , from [LOC China  ] .
