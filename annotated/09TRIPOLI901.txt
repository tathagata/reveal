End Summary . 
3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) During a November 10 meeting with the Ambassador and Pol/Econ Chief , [ORG Swiss Charge  ] [PER Stefano Lazarotto  ] provided additional details regarding the treatment of the two [MISC Swiss  ] citizens who had been detained since September 19 . 
[PER Lazarotto  ] said that the individuals unexpectedly appeared at his embassy on November 9 without prior warning and without any explanation from [MISC Libyan  ] authorities ( ref B ) . 
They reported that they had been well-fed and had all of their needs met while in detention -- including television and [MISC I-Pod  ] ( loaded with [MISC Libyan  ] music ) access ; however , they were denied their requests to contact their families and the [MISC Swiss  ] Embassy . 
According to [PER Lazarotto  ] , the individuals were transported to a location -- probably in the [LOC Tripoli  ] suburb of [LOC Suraj  ] -- that they could not identify . 
Once there , they were kept in isolation and were only allowed to see one another three times , via an exercise room that connected their rooms . 
They described their rooms as sparse , containing only beds and television sets . 
A plain-clothes guard force monitored the premises where they were being confined . 
[PER Lazarotto  ] said that the [MISC Libyans  ] had provided them medical care and treatment for high blood pressure , including medicine that the [MISC Swiss  ] Embassy provided through the [ORG GOL  ] . 
4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Lazarotto  ] reported that the Deputy Director of the [ORG European Affairs Department  ] at the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG MFA  ] contacted him on November 10 to say that a court date would be set for the [MISC Swiss  ] citizens one week hence , and to remind him of the charges that would be raised in the trial - namely , lack of proper residency permits . 
The official also requested that a phone call be quickly arranged between [PER Khaled Kaim  ] , [ORG MFA A/S-equivalent for International Cooperation  ] , and [MISC Swiss  ] State Secretary [PER Michael Ambuhl  ] to discuss a bilateral Memorandum of Understanding on the way forward . 
5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Lazarotto  ] told the Ambassador that [LOC Bern  ] was deliberately keeping the [MISC Swiss  ] Embassy , including [PER Lazarotto  ] himself , uninformed on [MISC Swiss  ] discussions with third countries regarding the [LOC Swiss-Libya  ] situation . 
However , he relayed that [LOC Bern  ] requested that the Ambassador , as well as the [MISC Italian  ] , [MISC French  ] and other ambassadors to [LOC Libya  ] , be present during the court hearing for the [MISC Swiss  ] to remind the [MISC Libyans  ] that they could not do anything under the " cover of darkness . 
" The Ambassador stated his inclination not to be present given the sensitive nature of his intervention on the issue and desire to stay behind the scenes . 
The Ambassador said that the Secretary had taken her counterpart 's request seriously and had asked the Embassy to raise the issue as a humanitarian concern ; however , we were disinclined to issue any public comments on what potential role we might have had . 
Details of the Ambassador 's intervention should remain discreet , which was a key to the success of our efforts . 
Were those efforts to become public , the [ORG GOL  ] may not respond to further interventions in the future . 
Lazaratto said [LOC Bern  ] hoped to convey official appreciation for our efforts in the near future . 
6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Comment and Action Request: After assessing that international attention led to the recent release , the [MISC Swiss  ] now want to proceed with international backing for their dealings with the [MISC Libyans  ] -- a step they arguably should have taken much earlier . 
To respond to the official [MISC Swiss  ] request , Post requests a [ORG Department decision  ] on whether the Ambassador should be present at the court hearing . 
Post 's inclination is to keep the Ambassador away from the hearing in order to maintain the discreet nature of our sensitive interventions so as not to provoke the [MISC Libyans  ] .
