( [ORG S  ] ) [PER A/S Hill  ] told VFM [PER Wu  ] that we are concerned about [MISC China-Japan  ] tension and urge both sides to make a serious effort to stabilize their relationship . 
Acknowledging [PER Wu  ] 's explanation about historical issues , [PER A/S Hill  ] said that [MISC Americans  ] remember [LOC Pearl Harbor  ] but that this has not prevented us from welcoming [LOC Japan  ] 's evolution into a peaceful and democratic country that plays a positive role in the world . 
[PER A/S Hill  ] said we are committed to making [MISC U.S.-Japan  ] relations work for us , for [LOC Japan  ] and for the rest of the world. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Wu  ] said the [LOC PRC  ] recognizes that it was the [LOC United States  ] that defeated [MISC Japanese  ] militarism , saying that the [LOC PRC  ] made a specific effort to call attention to the [LOC U.S.  ] role in WWII in various commemorations of the 60th anniversary of the end of the war in order to remind [MISC Chinese  ] of the [LOC U.S.  ] contribution . 
Rehashing familiar points , [PER Wu  ] said that if PM [PER Koizumi  ] wants to worship class-A war criminals at the [LOC Yasukuni Shrine  ] , that is his business , but not when he is Prime Minister . 
[PER Wu  ] cautioned that while [MISC Japanese  ] officials like to say that they share [LOC U.S.  ] values , this is not true when it comes to history . 
Urging the [LOC United States  ] to talk to [LOC Japan  ] as a friend about the need to show greater sensitivity about the history issue , [PER Wu  ] commented that it is in the [LOC U.S.  ] interest for [LOC Japan  ] to improve relations with the [ORG ROK  ] as well as [LOC China  ] . 
In addition to the [LOC Yasukuni Shrine  ] issue , [PER Wu  ] highlighted continuing delays in cleaning up abandoned [MISC Japanese  ] chemical weapons as a festering problem . 
This is not just a historical issue , as farmers continue to stumble on decaying chemical munitions , according to [PER Wu  ] . 
[LOC Beijing  ] takes relations with [LOC Tokyo  ] very seriously and fully understands their importance to both countries as well as to the region . 
The [LOC PRC  ] hopes [LOC Japan  ] will handle the history issue appropriately , [PER Wu  ] said , adding that [LOC Beijing  ] has no choice in how it responds if [LOC Tokyo  ] does not improve the situation. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Asked about the [LOC Doha  ] meeting between Foreign Ministers [PER Taro Aso  ] and [PER Li Zhaoxing  ] , [PER Wu  ] expressed guarded satisfaction , saying the two had agreed to work together to overcome obstacles to better bilateral relations . 
This includes improving cooperation in other fields , according to [PER Wu  ] , who noted that he knows [PER Aso  ] well and considers him a " pretty good guy " from his time as Ambassador in [LOC Tokyo  ] . 
[LOC Burma  ] ----- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) A/S [PER Hill  ] raised [LOC Burma  ] , noting that [MISC ASEAN  ] countries complain that their leverage over [LOC Rangoon  ] is limited because [LOC BEIJING  ] 00010909 002.3 OF 003 of [LOC Beijing  ] 's support for the regime . 
[PER A/S Hill  ] urged the [LOC PRC  ] to use its influence to convince the [MISC Burmese  ] regime to stop isolating itself , release [PER Aung San Suu Kyi  ] ( [ORG ASSK  ] ) , and begin true reform efforts , noting that continuing along the current path is dangerous to [LOC Burma  ] , its regime and to the region. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Wu  ] responded that there has not been real peace in [LOC Burma  ] for over 50 years , as no government has been able to completely resolve lingering ethnic disputes . 
Civilian and military governments have tried and failed , according to [PER Wu  ] , who commented that despite all of the military regime 's faults , it is possible that they have done better on ethnic issues than previous governments . 
The security situation in [LOC Burma  ] , particularly in the [LOC Northeast  ] , is very volatile . 
Noting that there had been an outbreak of fighting on May 24 , [PER Wu  ] said that a number of [MISC Burmese  ] had fled across the border into [LOC China  ] . 
Such incidents threaten stability on the [MISC Chinese  ] side of the border . 
In addition , the flow of narcotics from the [LOC Golden Triangle  ] has an impact on the [LOC PRC  ] , according to [PER Wu  ] , who said that [LOC Beijing  ] is increasingly frustrated with the [MISC Burmese  ] regime where one person makes every major decision . 
The [LOC PRC  ] had been caught by surprise when the regime moved the capital to [LOC Pyinmana  ] and was once again surprised when it changed the capital 's name earlier in the week , complained [ORG Wu.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) When pushed by [PER A/S Hill  ] , [PER Wu  ] said the [LOC PRC  ] has raised [ORG ASSK  ] on several occasions , explaining to the [MISC Burmese  ] that her release would send a positive signal of support for national reconciliation . 
[MISC Burmese  ] officials made clear that their vision for national reconciliation does not include [ORG ASSK  ] , said [PER Wu  ] , commenting that the most senior leaders fear her and are unlikely to release her . 
[MISC Chinese  ] leaders have also discussed the need to reach out to political parties and change the constitution , but with little response other than reiteration of [MISC Burmese  ] statements on ethnic reconciliation . 
[PER Wu  ] complained that during a 2005 visit , he held 12 hours of talks in which his [MISC Burmese  ] counterpart who read from only one page of talking points , constantly repeating himself . 
The [LOC PRC  ] supports [LOC Burma  ] because it is a neighbor , not because [LOC Beijing  ] likes its policies , stressed [PER Wu  ] , who said [LOC China  ] is trying to make clear to the [MISC Burmese  ] leadership that they must open up their country in order to promote economic development . 
The [LOC PRC  ] does not like the military regime but expects it to continue in power for the near future . 
[LOC Pacific Islands  ] --------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Acknowledging that VFM [PER Wu  ] is not directly responsible for [LOC Beijing  ] 's relations with the [LOC Pacific Islands  ] , [PER A/S Hill  ] stressed our concern that competition between the [LOC PRC  ] and [LOC Taiwan  ] is fueling corruption that weakens already precarious island states . 
[PER Wu  ] agreed that " money diplomacy " is bad , but blamed the phenomenon entirely on [LOC Taiwan  ] , asserting that the [LOC PRC  ] does not give money directly to individuals in return for diplomatic recognition . 
[PER A/S Hill  ] pointed out that the [LOC PRC  ] does provide a variety of assistance projects in [LOC Pacific Island  ] states that are often identified as providing side benefits for local leaders . 
This can have a similar impact to direct payments , commented [PER A/S Hill  ] , who noted that [LOC Australia  ] and [LOC New Zealand  ] have expressed concern about the destabilizing impact of PRC/Taiwan competition as took place in the [LOC Solomon Islands  ] . 
[PER Wu  ] said [LOC Beijing  ] will continue to work to improve its ties to the [LOC Pacific Island  ] states but also recognizes the importance of promoting stability and welcomes the [MISC Australian  ] and [LOC New Zealand  ] roles in the region . 
[MISC East Asian Architecture  ] ----------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Raising [LOC U.S.  ] concerns about the [ORG East Asia Summit  ] ( [ORG EAS  ] ) , VFM [PER Wu  ] urged the [LOC United States  ] to participate in the [ORG EAS  ] . 
While [MISC ASEAN  ] countries have internal differences on many issues , they all want [MISC ASEAN  ] to be in the driver 's seat , [PER Wu  ] stated . 
Noting that [LOC India  ] , [LOC Australia  ] and [LOC New Zealand  ] do not want to be second-class citizens in an evolving [MISC East Asian  ] architecture , [PER Wu  ] said [LOC Beijing  ] hopes they will have equal status under the 10 plus three framework . 
[MISC ASEAN  ] countries would like to see a [LOC U.S.  ] role in the [ORG EAS  ] , said [PER Wu  ] , who commented that [LOC U.S.  ] involvement would be positive for all concerned , including [LOC China  ] . 
[LOC U.S.  ] investment , market access and technology played a major role in developing [LOC Japan  ] , [LOC South BEIJING  ] 00010909 003.3 OF 003 [LOC Korea  ] , [LOC Taiwan  ] and [LOC Hong Kong  ] . 
The [LOC United States  ] is now playing a similar role in [LOC China  ] 's development as well as with most [MISC ASEAN  ] states . 
[PER Wu  ] said the [LOC PRC  ] will not challenge the [LOC U.S.  ] role and interests in [ORG East Asia.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 .
