( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Following up on reftel , [ORG Polmincouns  ] and poloff asked [MISC French  ] presidential adviser for NEA issues [PER Boris Boillon September  ] 6 about the visit to [LOC Tehran  ] by [MISC French  ] Presidency official [PER Richier  ] and [ORG MFA DAS  ] [PER Gellet  ] . 
[ORG Polmincouns  ] noted the stark phrasing in President [PER Sarkozy  ] 's speech to [MISC French  ] ambassadors ( indicating the world faced the choice between [LOC Iran  ] with a bomb or bombing [LOC Iran  ] ) and wondered what it meant in the context of the visit . 
[PER Boillon  ] was glad we raised the subject and stated that [PER Sarkozy  ] had wanted to warn [LOC Iran  ] in a dramatic and public way that it must cooperate with the international community with respect to its nuclear program or face potential catastrophe in the form of military action . 
This did not mean , as some media were misinterpreting the statement , that [LOC France  ] would be ready to participate in such action . 
Far from it , [PER Boillon  ] continued ; [LOC France  ] vigorously opposed a resort to force and preferred to resolve the ongoing dispute diplomatically. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Boillon  ] echoed much of what [ORG MFA DAS  ] [PER Gellet  ] had related in reftel when he observed that the [MISC Iranians  ] do not seem to understand the gravity of the situation or [LOC France  ] 's position . 
They suffer , he complained , from a closed mindset that he later termed " autistic . 
" [PER Boillon  ] recounted in the same terms as [PER Gellet  ] the origin of the [MISC Iranian  ] initiative from [PER Ali Akbar Velayati  ] , foreign affairs adviser to supreme leader [PER Khamenei  ] , to establish a special dialogue between [LOC Tehran  ] and [LOC Paris  ] . 
Even before [PER Richier  ] and [PER Gellet  ] traveled , the [ORG GOF  ] told the [MISC Iranians  ] to " forget it " if their intention was to split [LOC France  ] away from the [MISC P-5  ] plus one . 
[PER Richier  ] and [PER Gellet  ] repeated this message in [LOC Tehran  ] and indicated that [LOC France  ] might be willing to speak of other subjects ( NFI ) . 
[PER Boillon  ] believed the level was perfect in that the [MISC French  ] sent senior working level officials well below the " political level , " whereas [PER Velayati  ] clearly was at the political level . 
This disparity gave the [MISC French  ] considerable leeway in terms of the frankness with which they could speak. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Boillon  ] repeated that it was clear the [MISC Iranians  ] did not understand or accept the blunt message they heard . 
In his characteristic candor , [PER Richier  ] told [PER Velayati  ] and other [MISC Iranian  ] officials that , absent full compliance , sanctions against [LOC Iran  ] will only ratchet up . 
As he previewed the tough line that [PER Sarkozy  ] would express in his speech , [PER Richier  ] added that [LOC France  ] wants to avoid military action against [LOC Iran  ] but might eventually have to accept it as the only recourse left to the international community to prevent a nuclear-armed [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Boillon  ] stated that the [ORG GOF  ] had not decided whether to continue the dialogue that [PER Richier  ] and [PER Gellet  ] had started . 
Diplomatic contacts , nevertheless , continue apace , and he pointed to a then current visit to [LOC Paris  ] by [MISC Iranian  ] Deputy Foreign Minister for [MISC European  ] and [MISC American  ] Affairs [PER Jalili  ] . 
( Note: As reported by a staffer of KM [PER Kouchner September  ] 7 , [PER Jalili  ] had inexplicably not been briefed on [PER Richier  ] 's and [PER Gellet  ] 's message to [PER Velayati  ] . 
End note ) [PER Boillon  ] contended that [LOC France  ] had no problem pursuing a diplomatic dialogue per se and kept its embassy in [LOC Tehran  ] for just such a reason . 
As [PER Richier  ] told the [MISC Iranians  ] , however , there was no need for a special channel if the [MISC Iranian  ] aim was to pry [LOC France  ] away from the [MISC P-5  ] plus one . 
[PER Richier  ] was very direct that [LOC France  ] had no intention to deviate from the line it was on with its partners . 
[PER Boillon  ] expanded his assessment of the [MISC Iranians  ] as " autistic like the [MISC Syrians  ] . 
As with the [MISC Syrians  ] , one must be direct and not always 'd iplomatic.'
