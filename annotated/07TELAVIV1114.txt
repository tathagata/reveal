( C ) Summary . 
Representative [PER Gary Ackerman  ] ( D , [LOC New York  ] ) , Chairman of the [LOC Middle East  ] and [ORG South Asia Subcommittee  ] of the [ORG House International Relations Committee  ] , accompanied by the Ambassador , met with Opposition Leader [PER Binyamin Netanyahu  ] at the [ORG Knesset  ] April 11 . 
The discussion covered [PER Netanyahu  ] 's ideas on how to pressure [LOC Iran  ] in order to block its nuclear program and topple President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] ; [PER Netanyahu  ] 's views on dealing with the [MISC Palestinians  ] ; his critique of Prime Minister [PER Olmert  ] 's handling of the Second [LOC Lebanon  ] War ; and [PER Netanyahu  ] 's analysis of [LOC Israel  ] 's domestic political situation . 
On [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Netanyahu  ] advocated intensified financial pressures , including a [MISC U.S.-led  ] divestment effort focused largely on [MISC European  ] companies that invest in [LOC Iran  ] , as the best way to topple [PER Ahmadinejad  ] . 
On the [MISC Palestinians  ] , [PER Netanyahu  ] did not object to supporting President [PER Abbas  ] but said [LOC Israel  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] should first focus more on " strangling " [ORG Hamas  ] . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] asserted that [LOC Israel  ] 's mishandling of the [LOC Lebanon  ] war had strengthened [LOC Israel  ] 's enemies . 
He predicted that [PER Olmert  ] would not be able to stay in power much longer , then described several different mechanisms for forming a new government . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] expressed confidence that the [MISC Israeli  ] public recognized that he had been right , that unilateral withdrawals were a mistake , and that the priority now must be stopping [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] noted that he thought dropping the " right of return " was the acid test of [MISC Arab  ] intentions and insisted that he would never allow a single [MISC Palestinian  ] refugee to return to [LOC Israel  ] . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG House Middle East  ] and [ORG South Asia Subcommittee  ] Chairman [PER Gary Ackerman  ] , accompanied by the Ambassador , [PER Pol Couns  ] , [ORG Subcommittee Staff  ] Director [PER David Adams  ] , and [ORG Staff  ] member [PER Howard Diamond  ] called on Opposition and [ORG Likud Party  ] Leader [PER Binyamin Netanyahu  ] at the [ORG Knesset  ] April 11 . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] was joined by foreign policy adviser [PER Dore Gold  ] and MFA [ORG North American Department Congressional  ] liaison [PER Eyal Sela  ] . 
Toppling [PER Ahmadinejad  ] -------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Representative [PER Ackerman  ] told [PER Netanyahu  ] that in his meeting the day before with [MISC Egyptian  ] President [PER Mubarak  ] , he had asked [PER Mubarak  ] if military action were necessary to prevent [LOC Iran  ] from obtaining a nuclear weapon , should the strike be carried out by the [LOC U.S.  ] or [LOC Israel  ] ? 
[PER Mubarak  ] had responded that if it came to that , the [LOC U.S.  ] should do it and [LOC Israel  ] should stay out . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] said he took [PER Mubarak  ] 's point , but commented that he thought the [MISC Iranian  ] regime , or at least President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , could be toppled by economic pressure , including a divestment campaign . 
Noting that economic sanctions lose their effect over time , but can be powerful in the short term . 
The goal should be to encourage [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's political rivals to remove him from power . 
Afterward , if the pressure could be maintained it might be possible to bring down the entire [MISC Iranian  ] regime , but that would also entail identifying alternative leaders . 
The idea was to use economic pressure to create a public sense of regime failure . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] said he had consulted with noted historian [PER Bernard Lewis  ] , who believed that [LOC Iran  ] would be less dangerous once [PER Ahmadinejad  ] was removed. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Netanyahu  ] said there were three bills in [ORG Congress  ] designed to divest [LOC U.S.  ] pension funds from investing in about 300 , mostly [MISC European  ] , companies currently doing business in [LOC Iran  ] . 
Divestment would immediately bring down the credit ratings of these companies , thus forcing them to respond . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] urged [ORG Congress  ] to support the divestment legislation , adding that he also planned to use a visit to the [LOC U.S.  ] to raise the issue with [LOC Wall Street  ] fund managers . 
His approach was to tie in [LOC Darfur  ] to expand the scope of anti-genocide divestment and link it to [LOC U.S.  ] policy goals . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] said he was unsure that financial pressures would be enough to stop [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program , but he was confident they would succeed in bringing down [PER Ahmadinejad  ] . 
He commended [PER Dore Gold  ] 's efforts to put [PER Ahmadinejad  ] on a genocide watch list as part of a broader effort to delegitimize the [MISC Iranian  ] President . 
Asked about the quality of [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Israeli  ] intelligence on [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Netanyahu  ] said his nightmare was that we had missed part of the [MISC Iranian  ] program . 
He added that if the current intelligence was correct , it would take [LOC Iran  ] a few more years to develop a nuclear weapon . 
He agreed with Ambassador Jones' assessment that TEL AVIV 00001114 002 OF 003 [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's announcement of a breakthrough in [LOC Iran  ] 's centrifuge program was probably exaggerated . 
It would be critical , [PER Netanyahu  ] stressed , to target companies investing in [LOC Iran  ] 's energy sector . 
Bring Down [ORG Hamas  ] ---------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Congressman [PER Ackerman  ] asked [PER Netanyahu  ] for his views on [MISC Palestinian  ] President [PER Mahmoud Abbas  ] . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] said [PER Abbas  ] was a " nice man who means well , " but he added that [LOC Israel  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] should focus on " bringing down [ORG Hamas  ] " through an " economic squeeze . 
" [PER Netanyahu  ] asserted that eight months ago , the [ORG Hamas  ] government had been on the brink of collapse , but had become stronger because [LOC Israel  ] became weaker as a result of the [LOC Lebanon  ] war . 
Without elaborating , [PER Netanyahu  ] said it would be easier to weaken [ORG Hamas  ] than to strengthen [ORG Abbas.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Netanyahu  ] commented that [PER Shimon Peres  ] had admitted to him that the [LOC Oslo  ] process had been based on a mistaken economic premise , and as a result [MISC European  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] assistance to the [MISC Palestinians  ] had gone to create a bloated bureaucracy , with [ORG PA  ] employees looking to the international community to meet their payroll . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] predicted that [MISC Palestinians  ] would vote for [PER Abbas  ] if they believe that he can deliver the money . 
He suggested putting in place an " economic squeeze with an address , " so that [ORG Hamas  ] would receive the popular blame . 
Asked if [PER Fatah  ] knew how to conduct an election campaign , [PER Netanyahu  ] said the [MISC Palestinian  ] patronage system should be forced to collapse , which would have an immediate impact since the entire [MISC Palestinian  ] economy was based on graft and patronage . 
Instead , he asserted , the opposite was happening . 
[ORG Hamas  ] was also handling the prisoner release issue well since they had created the impression that [ORG Hamas  ] was in control of the process and " sticking it to the [MISC Israelis  ] . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Congressman [PER Ackerman  ] asked if [PER Abbas  ] would survive politically . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] said he was unsure , since politics were stressful , especially [MISC Palestinian  ] politics . 
The policy , he added , should be to starve the [ORG NUG  ] . 
If any money is given , it should go directly to [PER Abbas  ] . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] said it was not clear the [ORG GOI  ] has a policy , there was a general climate of weakness . 
[LOC Lebanon  ] War Failures -------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Turning to the Second [LOC Lebanon  ] War , [PER Netanyahu  ] said the problem was not the war 's goals but rather the disconnect between goals and methods . 
If the [MISC IDF  ] had used a flanking move by a superior ground force , it could have won easily . 
Instead , [LOC Israel  ] " dripped troops into their gunsights , " an approach he termed " stupid . 
" The top leadership had lacked a sense of military maneuver . 
In addition , they had been afraid to take military casualties , but instead got many civilian casualties . 
If [PER Olmert  ] had mobilized the reserves in ten days , seized ground , destroyed [ORG Hizballah  ] in southern [LOC Lebanon  ] , and then withdrawn , he would be a hero today . 
Instead , [PER Netanyahu  ] predicted , [PER Olmert  ] will not last politically . 
[PER Olmert  ] 's current public support levels of three percent were unsustainable . 
A New Government ? ----------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Netanyahu  ] said the pressure on [PER Olmert  ] was accumulating as a result of corruption investigations as well as the impending release of the [ORG Winograd Commission  ] 's interim report . 
[PER Olmert  ] could be pushed out as a result of a rebellion within the [ORG Kadima Party  ] . 
[ORG Kadima  ] members are realizing they cannot allow [PER Olmert  ] to stay in power , but [ORG Kadima  ] itself might collapse since it was a " fake party . 
" [PER Netanyahu  ] described several options , including [ORG Kadima  ] replacing [PER Olmert  ] , a new coalition formed in the [ORG Knesset  ] , or [PER Netanyahu  ] 's preferred option , new elections . 
New elections , he stated , are supported by sixty-five percent of the public . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] insisted he was in no rush since he was " enjoying the time with his family " and rebuilding the [ORG Likud Party  ] . 
[ORG Likud  ] was reaching thousands of new supporters , including many highly educated professionals and high tech entrepreneurs , through the internet. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Netanyahu  ] asserted there was a growing sense in the public that he had been right in the last election . 
TEL AVIV 00001114 003 OF 003 Unilateral " retreats " ( i.e. such as the withdrawals from [LOC Gaza  ] and southern [LOC Lebanon  ] ) were the wrong way to go . 
[LOC Israel  ] had allowed an [MISC Iranian  ] enclave to establish itself in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
[LOC Syria  ] was arming itself for the first time in 20 years , [ORG Hizballah  ] had rearmed since the war , and [LOC Gaza  ] was being turned into a bunker . 
[LOC Egypt  ] was not doing on a twelve mile front along the [LOC Gaza  ] border what [LOC Jordan  ] was doing on a 150-mile front . 
The way out was to stop [LOC Iran  ] , thereby dealing with the octopus , not just its tentacles . 
Right of Return the [LOC Acid Test  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Netanyahu  ] stated that a return to the 1967 borders and dividing [LOC Jerusalem  ] was not a solution since further withdrawals would only whet the appetite of radical [MISC Islam  ] . 
[PER Ackerman  ] asked if the [MISC Palestinians  ] would accept peace based on the 1967 lines . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] said he would not agree to such a withdrawal since the 1967 lines were indefensible , but he added that the " right of return " was the real acid test of [MISC Arab  ] intentions . 
Instead of [LOC Israel  ] making more step-by-step concessions , [LOC Israel  ] should insist that further concessions be linked to reciprocal steps toward peace . 
The [MISC Palestinians  ] must drop the right of return and accept [LOC Israel  ] 's right to exist . 
The [MISC Arab  ] initiative did not meet this standard since it keeps the right of return open . 
[LOC Israel  ] will only have a peace partner when the [MISC Palestinians  ] drop the right of return . 
Asked whether [LOC Israel  ] could accept case by case exceptions , [PER Netanyahu  ] insisted not one refugee could ever return . 
[LOC Israel  ] , after all , was not asking for the right of [MISC Jews  ] to return to [LOC Baghdad  ] or [LOC Cairo.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Netanyahu  ] said [ORG UNSCR  ] 242 was not a bad formula since it did not specify precisely from which territories [LOC Israel  ] would withdraw . 
After the withdrawals from [LOC Gaza  ] and [LOC Lebanon  ] , there was deep disillusionment among [MISC Israelis  ] about the principle of land for peace . 
Even the noted [MISC Israeli  ] leftist writer [PER AB Yehoshua  ] had said in a recent interview that he despaired about peace because the [MISC Arabs  ] wanted all of [LOC Israel  ] . 
From 1948 to 1967 , the conflict had not been about occupied territories , but that point had been obscured by " effective propaganda . 
" The root of the conflict was an [MISC Arab  ] desire to destroy [LOC Israel  ] , which had now become part of the larger ambitions of radical [MISC Islam.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) The 1967 borders were not the solution since [LOC Israel  ] was the only force blocking radical [MISC Islam  ] 's agenda of overrunning [LOC Jordan  ] and [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] proposed that [LOC Israel  ] offer to work with the [MISC Saudis  ] against [LOC Iran  ] . 
If [LOC Iran  ] was not stopped , there would be no agreement with the [MISC Palestinians  ] , and the peace treaties with [LOC Jordan  ] and [LOC Egypt  ] would come under tremendous pressure . 
There could be no deterrence against " crazies " such as [PER Ahmadinejad  ] . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] advised [ORG Congress  ] to expedite the legislative effort for divestment . 
If that did not work , we could reconsider other options . 
Congressman [PER Ackerman  ] said that if [PER Netanyahu  ] came to [LOC Washington  ] , he would hold a hearing on divestment. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 .
