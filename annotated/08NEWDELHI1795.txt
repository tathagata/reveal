( C ) Summary . 
A May visit to six [MISC Tibetan  ] settlements across north and northeastern [LOC India  ] underscores concerns that frustrated and dissatisfied [MISC Tibetan  ] youth and concurrent [MISC Indian  ] separatist movements could pose serious problems for the future viability of [MISC Tibetan  ] settlements . 
A widening generational divide finds [MISC Tibetan  ] leaders unable to resolve growing dissatisfaction among younger [MISC Tibetans  ] , led by the influential [ORG Tibetan Youth Congress  ] ( [ORG TYC  ] ) . 
Settlement leaders in [LOC West Bengal  ] reluctantly discussed intimidation and extortion of [MISC Tibetans  ] by [MISC Indian  ] separatist movements , feebly dismissing the threats as “neighborly” interactions . 
[MISC Tibetan  ] participation in events organized by pro-Gorkaland radicals -- whether forced or not -- could jeopardize relations between the [MISC Tibetan  ] community and their [MISC Indian  ] hosts . 
The [ORG Central Tibetan Administration  ] ( [ORG CTA  ] ) will need to address these issues or the Government of [LOC India  ] ( [ORG GOI  ] ) may address them instead . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) This is the first in a three-part series assessing the [MISC Tibetan  ] refugee situation in [LOC India  ] . 
[ORG Kathmandu’s Regional Refugee Coordinator  ] , [ORG New Delhi PolOff  ] and [LOC Kolkata  ] POL FSN visited [LOC New Delhi  ] , [LOC Dharamsala  ] and remote [MISC Tibetan  ] settlements in [LOC West Bengal  ] , [LOC Sikkim  ] , and [LOC Arunachal Pradesh  ] . 
These reports distill two weeks of meetings with the [ORG Central Tibetan Administration  ] ( [ORG CTA  ] ) , refugee reception centers , [ORG GOI  ] and [ORG CTA  ] administered schools , settlement officers , monastery officials , health workers , nongovernmental organizations ( [ORG NGOs  ] ) , the [MISC Tibetan  ] Youth [ORG Congress  ] ( [ORG TYC  ] ) , and [ORG GOI  ] liaisons with the [MISC Tibetan  ] settlements . 
[LOC New Delhi  ] PolOffs subsequently met with [MISC Delhi-based  ] human rights activists . 
The first cable of this series , Part I , details increasing dissatisfaction among [MISC Tibetan  ] youth and the potential consequences for the [MISC Tibetan  ] community in [LOC India  ] ; Part II examines the settlements’ relations with neighboring local populations and [MISC Indian  ] separatist movements in [LOC West Bengal  ] and the [ORG Northeast  ] ; and Part III assesses the settlements’ socio-economic situation . 
This three-part series reflects collaboration between [ORG Embassy New Delhi  ] , Consulate [LOC Kolkata  ] and [ORG Embassy Kathmandu  ] . 
[ORG TYC’s  ] “Imprudent” Strategy -------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) With few professional opportunities and growing impatience with the [PER Dalai Lama’s  ] “Middle Way , ” young [MISC Tibetans  ] expressed frustration with their future prospects . 
These frustrations are articulated regularly by the [ORG TYC  ] , which advocates complete independence from [LOC People’s Republic of China  ] ( [LOC PRC  ] ) . 
The [ORG TYC  ] has 30,000 members in 83 chapters worldwide . 
The chapters vary widely in their degrees of organization and activism , with the chapters in [LOC New Delhi  ] , [LOC Kathmandu  ] , and some western capitals constituting a well-organized and influential force . 
The [ORG TYC’s  ] mission statement ( posted online ) declares that one of its main objectives is “to struggle for the rightful independence of [LOC Tibet  ] even at the cost of one’s life.” Accordingly , while the group pledges support to the [PER Dalai Lama  ] , its published objectives conflict with the [PER Dalai Lama’s Middle Way  ] , which promotes [MISC Tibetan  ] autonomy within the [LOC PRC  ] . 
The [ORG TYC  ] has coordinated the most dramatic anti-China protests , including scaling the walls of the [MISC Chinese  ] embassy in [LOC New Delhi  ] four times in the past eight months ( October 12,2007 and March 12 , March 21 , and April 21 in 2008 ) and mobilizing over 25,000 protesters to converge upon the capital in August 2007 ( Reftels ) . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] emphasized that the group’s handbook instructs members “never to raise a fist” and explained that the activities are designed only to embarrass India’s northern neighbor . 
The [ORG TYC  ] is proud that it has succeeded in attracting [MISC Chinese  ] ire -- revealing that [LOC China  ] feels threatened by the [ORG TYC  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also emphasized the [ORG TYC’s  ] other role -- that of a “CTA watchdog , ” promoting democratization , monitoring the socio-economic situation in the settlements , and directing [ORG CTA  ] attention to vulnerable communities . 
With evident self-satisfaction , he noted that over the past decade , the [ORG TYC  ] had parted ways with the [ORG CTA  ] , comparing the relationship to a parent ( [ORG CTA  ] ) who cannot come to terms with the child’s ( [ORG TYC  ] ) maturation. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Older [MISC Tibetan  ] leaders regard the [ORG TYC’s  ] activities as [LOC NEW DELHI  ] 00001795 002.2 OF 003 imprudent . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] worries that if Tibet’s status is not resolved during the [PER Dalai Lama’s  ] lifetime , the youth movement could become “more radical and dangerous” and predicted that “the debate over future strategy could fracture the [MISC Tibetan  ] community.” [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] fears that the [ORG TYC  ] is escalating radicalization of the [MISC Tibetan  ] youth and that [ORG TYC  ] leadership [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] is purposefully antagonizing the [ORG GOI  ] in an effort to garner international media attention . 
After the [MISC TYC-coordinated  ] storming of the [MISC Chinese  ] embassy in [LOC New Delhi  ] , the [LOC PRC  ] has increased pressure on the [ORG GOI  ] to control the [MISC Tibetan  ] refugee population . 
The [ORG GOI  ] responded by restricting settlement activity in several states and increasing the rates of arrests and detentions of [MISC Tibetan  ] activists ( Reftels ) . 
( Comment: [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] End Comment . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] dismissed the potential consequences of irritating the [ORG GOI  ] , which has tolerated most demonstrations , arguing that supporters praise the [ORG TYC’s  ] measures . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that the [PER Dalai Lama’s  ] moderate strategy has failed to produce results over the past five decades . 
( Note: Independent of these site visits , human rights activist [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told PolOffs that the [MISC Indian  ] [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] unofficially backs the [ORG TYC  ] and is pleased with the opportunity to humiliate the [MISC Chinese  ] government . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] disclosed that [ORG TYC  ] leaders [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] “camped out” in his NGO’s office during the protests in August 2007 . 
He also expressed concern that the [ORG TYC  ] may push the [ORG GOI  ] too far and advised CENTREX members to use caution . 
End Note . 
) Few Options Open ---------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Unfortunately , life in the settlements offers relatively few options for making a living . 
Older [MISC Tibetans  ] in every settlement visited consistently complained that the younger generation will move to urban areas or the west , leaving [MISC Tibetan  ] communities populated by children and the elderly . 
Programs in the settlements focus principally on traditional [MISC Tibetan  ] handicrafts , organic farming , and tailoring - options that offer relatively low wages and little possibility for a brighter future . 
[MISC Tibetan  ] students complete high school in [LOC India  ] and look towards higher education , but funding is scarce and employment prospects are grim . 
While [MISC Tibetans  ] enjoy a relatively privileged refugee status , [MISC Indian  ] law bars them from most employment opportunities and from purchasing property . 
Even top graduates who find a placement in the [ORG CTA  ] only eke out a living . 
One young professional confided that her [ORG CTA  ] salary is a paltry 1,400 USD per year . 
Several settlement officers complained that the young , educated [MISC Tibetans  ] prefer emigrating to learning the traditional crafts , leading elders to fear that [MISC Tibetan  ] culture may die out with this generation . 
( Comment: [ORG Embassy Kathmandu  ] Refcoord spoke to the [MISC Dalai Lama’s  ] special envoy [PER Lodi Gyari  ] on June 16 about the frustrating lack of opportunities for youth in the settlements . 
He readily acknowledged that this was one of the most serious concerns facing the [ORG CTA  ] . 
He said that the [ORG CTA  ] has been actively seeking alternatives and would welcome international assistance to that end . 
End Comment ) <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) In [LOC Sikkim  ] and [LOC Arunachal Pradesh  ] , [MISC Tibetan  ] youth take advantage of one career option - the Special [ORG Frontier Force  ] ( [ORG SFF  ] ) . 
Seven [ORG SFF  ] units , based in [LOC Chakrata  ] , [LOC Uttarkhand  ] form a special division of the [MISC Indian  ] army composed solely of [MISC Tibetans  ] . 
The [ORG GOI  ] entrusts [ORG SFF  ] to protect its borders , stationing [MISC Tibetans  ] along the border with [LOC China  ] and in [LOC Ladakh  ] . 
The [MISC Tibetans  ] can only attain the rank of junior officer and earn a meager salary compared to their [MISC Indian  ] counterparts . 
Yet , most [MISC Tibetan  ] men in northeastern [LOC India  ] join the [ORG SFF  ] . 
In [LOC Gangtok  ] , the Welfare Officer noted that the majority of [MISC Tibetan  ] men work for the [ORG SFF  ] ; and in [LOC Ravangla  ] , 90% of the [MISC Tibetan  ] families have at least one family member serving . 
In [LOC Miao  ] , about 350 of the settlement’s youth serve in the [LOC SFF.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Tibetan  ] leaders expressed concern over future [LOC NEW DELHI  ] 00001795 003.2 OF 003 options for the youth , but have yet to successfully formulate a strategy . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated that the [ORG CTA  ] plans to educate and empower the youth , yet neither he ( nor any other community leader ) could specify any new programs to achieve this goal . 
Miao’s settlement officer , incidentally the most dynamic leader among those interviewed , reported that the sole takeaway from a conference dedicated to the generational divide was that the [ORG CTA  ] organize more “tea parties” to speak informally with younger [MISC Tibetans  ] . 
The leaders are genuinely distressed about the younger generation and recognize that they must concentrate on alternative income strategies ; however , they may need -- and have said they would welcome -- outside assistance to create more diverse opportunities beyond traditional [MISC Tibetan  ] crafts and agriculture . 
Comment - [MISC Tibetans  ] Concerned , but No [ORG New Strategies  ] --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [MISC Tibetan  ] leaders in [LOC India  ] understand the gravity of the youths’ growing frustration , yet thus far they have not been able to produce a strategy to counter the youth’s growing impatience politically , with [ORG Middle Way  ] moderates , and limited economic prospects . 
Many [MISC Tibetans  ] interviewed expressed concern that if there is no movement to resolve the [MISC Tibetans’  ] long exile and if economic opportunities likewise remain stagnant , frustration could propel [MISC Tibetan  ] youths toward more radical actions .
