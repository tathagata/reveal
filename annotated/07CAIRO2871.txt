[PER CAIRO  ] 2825 Classified By: ECPO Minister Counselor [PER William R. Stewart  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . ------- Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [LOC Egypt  ] faces uncertainty as it moves towards a post-Mubarak future . 
It has been almost exactly twenty-six years since [LOC Egypt  ] last faced such a transition . 
Although one could argue that some of the elements that led to the dramatic events of September and October 1981 are back in place -- shortages of basic foodstuffs , external political pressures , and crackdowns on political adversaries -- tensions now are different , and not on the same scale . 
While we should not place too much weight in analogy , it can nevertheless be instructive to review the events of September and October 1981 to see what useful comparisons can be made . 
End summary. --------------- Rumors Run Amok --------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) This September , as in past late summers , salon talk and front page headlines have focused on that most sensitive of topics: the health of the president and the eventual transfer of power . 
Talk has been so pervasive , Prime Minister [PER Nazif  ] felt obliged to announce that " there is a system for the smooth transfer of power . 
" Rumors of President [PER Mubarak  ] 's deteriorating health -- and even his demise -- have been so insistent , even [PER Suzanne Mubarak  ] felt the need to publicly assert that he is alive and well. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) At least half a dozen editorials have compared the tensions and rumors of this September to September 1981 . 
Although the majority of [MISC Egyptians  ] are too young to recall personally those momentous times , the lore of it remains deep in the national consciousness . 
Even young [MISC Egyptians  ] recall hearing of the great " round up " of September 3 , 1981 when [PER Sadat  ] seemed to " go crazy " as one commentator recalled , arresting and imprisoning opponents and critics of every stripe . 
[MISC Communists  ] , [MISC Nasserists  ] , [ORG Muslim Brothers  ] , academics , and liberal-minded journalists found themselves cell-mates that late summer day . 
Even [MISC Coptic  ] [PER Pope Shenouda  ] was placed under house arrest . 
Although [PER Mubarak  ] has hardly gone so far , some observers have argued that his feuds with [PER Ayman Nour  ] , [PER Anwar Esmat El-Sadat  ] ( the late president 's nephew ) , [PER Saad Eddin Ibrahim  ] , independent editors , and other perceived opponents , combined with his sweeping roundup of the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] -- arguably his only real political threat -- is reminiscent of 1981 , and they fear it could lead to similar consequences. ------------------- [PER Mubarak  ] Is No [PER Sadat  ] ------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) According to some of [LOC Egypt  ] 's most astute political observers , this is over-analyzing the situation and drawing very wrong -- and dangerous - comparisons . 
[PER Mohammed El-Bassiouni  ] , chairman of the [MISC Majlis  ] al-Shura 's [ORG National Security Committee  ] ( which also has responsibility for [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] and [ORG Arab Affairs  ] ) , believes that the two Septembers have very little in common . 
[PER El-Bassiouni  ] recently told [MISC MinCouns  ] that in 1981 , when he was [LOC Egypt  ] 's military attach in [LOC Tel Aviv  ] , President [PER Sadat  ] was under extreme pressure for not providing the " peace dividend " he had promised would be the result of his bold move towards [LOC Israel  ] , and his deepening friendship the [LOC United States  ] . 
When prosperity for all did not appear , [PER Sadat  ] felt under enormous pressure . 
Combined with [LOC Egypt  ] 's isolation in the [MISC Arab  ] world , it seemed that his gamble had failed . 
In his pride , he lashed out at perceived opponents. -------------- No Comparison ? -------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Such a scenario simply does not exist today , [PER El-Bassiouni  ] opined . 
[LOC Egypt  ] 's economy is growing , the fruit of President [PER Mubarak  ] 's reform program launched in 2004 . 
While relations with [LOC Israel  ] are still " problematic , " [PER Mubarak  ] has taken [LOC Egypt  ] back to its rightful position as leader of the [MISC Arab  ] world . 
The external pressures that helped stoke the tension of September 1981 " simply do not exist today . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Another alleged similarity between the present and [PER Sadat  ] 's September is the shortage of basic commodities . 
[MISC Egyptians  ] have been angered in recent weeks by reports of villages without access to drinking water -- in some cases , for years ( ref A ) . 
Shortages of subsidized bread have also been in the headlines , as the poorest [MISC Egyptians  ] wait in queues for shrinking loaves . 
At least one observer has made the case that September 2007 is more reminiscent of January 1977 -- when riots erupted throughout [LOC Egypt  ] due to price increases for bread and other basic foodstuffs -- than September 1981 . 
But Dr. [PER Galal Amin  ] , economics professor at [ORG AUC  ] ( as he was in 1981 ) thinks there is little in common , economically , between the two eras . 
[LOC Egypt  ] under [PER Sadat  ] , he argued , was actually better off in many ways: unemployment , which he sees as the single greatest problem facing [PER Mubarak  ] today , was lower then , and the overall standard of living was higher . 
The average [MISC Egyptian  ] , he said felt that opportunities were greater in 1981 , leading to general optimism . 
[PER Sadat  ] 's " infitah " program , opening up [LOC Egypt  ] 's economy to foreign investment appeared to be working and creating jobs . 
Tourism was taking off , and the average [MISC Egyptian  ] " felt good " about his life and better about his future than [MISC Egyptians  ] today , according to [PER Amin  ] . 
Economic statistics refute [PER Amin  ] 's assertions , but there is a perception within a certain statist/elite/academic demographic , represented by [PER Amin  ] , that somehow [PER Sadat  ] 's were " the good old days . 
" ------------------------------------------- Economic Reform Still Masks Underlying Woes ------------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Sadat  ] trumpeted economic reform , touting privatization , pointing to a freer market that would benefit all [MISC Egyptians  ] . 
These thoughts have been echoed under [PER Mubarak  ] , especially since the appointment of Prime Minister [PER Nazif  ] and his cabinet of economic reformers in 2004 . 
However , as in 1981 , recent economic advances are incomplete . 
Gigantic government subsidies then , as now , have served to brake greater economic reform . 
In 1981 , 21.5% of the [ORG Gross National Income  ] ( [ORG GNI  ] ) went to the wealthiest 5% of the population , while the poorest 20% of the population received a mere 5% of [LOC Egypt  ] 's income . 
In 2007 , there remains the general sense that [LOC Egypt  ] 's economic growth is benefiting only a tiny portion of the population . 
17% of today 's population lives under the poverty line , almost identical to the percentage in 1981 , and the poorest 20% of the population received 4.8% of the [ORG GNI  ] in 2004/05 , while the richest 10% of the population received 30% of [ORG GNI  ] . 
Although statistically the standard of living has not dramatically deteriorated , neither has it improved , leaving [MISC Egyptians  ] with the feeling that others have passed them by to a brighter economic future. -------------- The [ORG Odd Couple  ] -------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) What the two periods unquestionably do have in common are a pair of increasingly isolated dictators , set in their ways and fearful of any kind of dissent . 
But though alike in certain personal characteristics ( particularly paranoia ) , there are at the same time some very fundamental differences , including age ( [PER Sadat  ] was a robust 63 years old when assassinated ; [PER Mubarak  ] is a slowing 79 ) and length in office ( barely 11 years for [PER Sadat  ] , closing on 26 years for [PER Mubarak  ] ) . 
Importantly , [PER Sadat  ] had a clear successor -- his vice president , [PER Hosni Mubarak  ] . 
[PER Mubarak  ] , in turn , has scrupulously avoided naming a VP , and although most believe that son [PER Gamal  ] will succeed him , no one can say for certain how that will play out . 
Another dissimilarity: Minister of Information [PER Enas El-Fiqi  ] , under intense scrutiny and pressure himself for allowing the rumors about [PER Mubarak  ] 's health to get out of control , recently told the Ambassador that " there is no comparison " between [PER Sadat  ] and [PER Mubarak  ] because , " [PER Mubarak  ] never loses his temper . 
" ( [PER El-Fiqi  ] , though , admitted that the stress of his job was literally driving him to drink . 
) <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Mubarak  ] relishes his self-image as a benign , paternal leader , tough but fair . 
Still , he has shown signs of moving toward [PER Sadat  ] 's modus operandi in dealing with political opponents . 
In the past year , [PER Mubarak  ] has arrested upwards of a thousand [ORG Muslim Brothers  ] . 
While some have subsequently been released and only 40 are facing trial before a military tribunal so far , the message is unmistakable: after allowing the [LOC MB  ] to participate in the 2005 parliamentary elections as " independents " ( in which they won 88 seats , 20% of the Assembly ) , [PER Mubarak  ] is cracking down . 
Another similarity is the recent phobia [PER Mubarak  ] has developed towards the press . 
The [MISC Egyptian  ] media , arguably as free as it has ever been ( and certainly freer than it was under [PER Sadat  ] ) , is suddenly facing a cost for that liberty . 
In early September , four editors of independent newspapers were convicted of insulting the president and other GoE officials , while another editor is facing trial October 1 for allegedly spreading false rumors about [PER Mubarak  ] 's health which were damaging to [LOC Egypt  ] 's reputation and to its economy . 
These arrests have been widely seen here as blatant attacks on the freedom of the press , much as [PER Sadat  ] 's rounding up of journalists was in <a id='par1981' href='#par1981'>¶</a>1981. ------------------------- Love and Hate For the [LOC USA  ] ------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) One of the more striking similarities between the two leaders is their uneven relationship with the [LOC United States  ] . 
[PER Sadat  ] 's September madness came close on the heels of a profoundly disappointing trip to the [LOC United States  ] to meet the new President , [PER Ronald Reagan  ] . 
By discarding the [LOC Soviet Union  ] and reaching out to the [LOC United States  ] -- and [LOC Israel  ] -- he had taken considerable political risk . 
He had calculated that the payoff in tangible and intangible terms would more than justify that risk . 
But as his international stature increased spectacularly as the [MISC Arab  ] world 's " [MISC Man of Peace  ] , " his standing at home did not keep pace , as heightened expectations for peace and prosperity were unrealized . 
Still , in the [LOC U.S.  ] he felt he had found a faithful ally , one that would stand by him even when his own people did not . 
Unfortunately , President [PER Reagan  ] 's reception of [PER Sadat  ] in August 1981 was lukewarm , and [PER Sadat  ] came under severe criticism by the [LOC U.S.  ] press for not delivering true peace to the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
According to [PER Mohamed Heikal  ] , [PER Sadat  ] 's former Minister of Information ( who was himself arrested on September 3 , 1981 ) , [PER Sadat  ] returned to [LOC Egypt  ] a bitter man , feeling betrayed by the [MISC Americans  ] . 
Shortly afterwards came the arrests. -------------- [PER Twin Twilights  ] -------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) At the end of the day , and the end of their reigns , [PER Sadat  ] faced and [PER Mubarak  ] faces similar situations . 
But [PER Mubarak  ] seems to have managed the dilemma better in at least one key area: he has systematically and " legally " eliminated virtually all political opposition , leaving only the [LOC MB  ] standing , having foresworn violence and politically emasculated . 
[PER Mubarak  ] 's internal security apparatus , an estimated 1.4 million strong , is at least twice the size it was under [PER Sadat  ] . 
Its ubiquitous presence and monopoly of the legitimate use of armed power makes any kind of violent change of leader unlikely. --------------------- The One Certain Thing --------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The two presidents share another undeniable point in common: their mortality . 
[PER Mubarak  ] 's street credibility , like [PER Sadat  ] 's , is very low . 
The was illustrated by the insistent rumors of [PER Mubarak  ] 's illness and death , despite numerous official denials . 
This lack of faith by the people of [LOC Egypt  ] in their political leaders could well come back to haunt [PER Mubarak  ] 's successor , whomever he may be . 
Will it make the transition more difficult ? 
Yes . 
Will it matter in the end ? 
Probably not , as long as the successor enjoys the support of the elite and the security apparatus , including the military . 
And even if there is a valid analogy to draw between September 1981 and September 2007 , it is at best uneven . 
The world -- and [LOC Egypt  ] -- have fundamentally changed . 
While President [PER Mubarak  ] clearly faces significant challenges , and has reacted with at least some measure of [PER Sadat  ] 's paranoia , we do not foresee September 2007 leading to another October <a id='par1981' href='#par1981'>¶</a>1981 .
