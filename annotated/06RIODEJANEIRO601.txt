( [ORG U  ] ) [MISC Summary: On  ] October 21 Admiral [PER Edmund P. Giambastiani Jr.  ] , Vice Chairman of the [ORG Joint Chiefs of Staff  ] , the Ambassador , and the Consul General met with [ORG Embraer  ] President & CEO [PER Mauricio Novis Botelho  ] and Executive Vice President for Defense and Government Market , Luiz [PER Carlos Aguiar  ] , to review bilateral commercial relations between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Our [MISC Brazilian  ] interlocutors discussed [ORG Embraer  ] 's recent history and strong financial status , the company 's success in the regional and executive jet markets , and its desire to continue doing business with the [LOC U.S.  ] , particularly in the defense " niche market . 
" Admiral [PER Giambastiani  ] emphasized the [ORG USG  ] 's need for joint service platforms that maximize military utility and cost efficiency . 
End summary . 
EMBRAER'S POSITIVE RISK PROFILE <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG Embraer  ] 's [PER Botelho  ] said he thought it would be fruitful to talk about the benefits that both countries can gain with increased partnership . 
He started out by focusing on [ORG Embraer  ] 's positive financial status and risk profile , stating that he feels that [ORG Embraer  ] is a " good example of what free trade is all about , " with [LOC US  ] 20 billion dollars in exports last year and 10 billion dollars in imports . 
12 to 14 billion dollars worth of goods and services were exported just to the [LOC US  ] . 
Those statistics put [ORG Embraer  ] just behind [ORG Airbus  ] ( [LOC France  ] ) and [ORG Boeing  ] ( [LOC US  ] ) in the aircraft market , and vying for third place with [ORG Bombardier  ] ( [LOC Canada  ] ) . 
[PER Botelho  ] indicated that [ORG Bombardier  ] is technically bigger in terms of overall revenue , but that [ORG Embraer  ] has surpassed [ORG Bombardier  ] in commercial aircraft . 
[ORG Embraer  ] represents approximately 50 percent market share at present in 36 to 126-passenger aircraft. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Operating in 69 countries , the company enjoys excellent financial status and recently received an investment grade rating by both [ORG Standard and Poors  ] and [ORG Moody 's  ] . 
The company has a nearly [LOC US  ] 14 billion dollar backlog of solid orders and an additional almost 15 billion dollars in options , totaling more than 2,000 aircraft , and it has been ranked as one of the largest [MISC Brazilian  ] exporters since 1997 . 
It is a major player on commercial aircraft , and has a niche operation in the defense market . 
In the [LOC U.S.  ] , [ORG Embraer  ] has facilities located in Ft . 
[PER Lauderdale  ] and in [LOC Nashville  ] . 
In addition , it recently announced that it will establish facilities in [LOC New Hartford  ] , [LOC CT  ] and an additional one in Ft . 
[PER Lauderdale  ] , as well as one in [LOC Mesa  ] , [LOC Arizona  ] which will potentially employ 250 workers . 
Currently , [ORG Embraer  ] has 38 additional service centers to sustain its fleet of business jets. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG Embraer  ] has developed risk-sharing partnerships with major [LOC U.S.  ] aerospace companies , including [ORG General Electric Engine Company  ] , [ORG Allison Engines  ] ( later purchased by [ORG RR  ] ) , [ORG Honeywell  ] , [ORG Hamilton Sundstrand  ] , C&D , and [ORG Goodrich  ] . 
It also has relationships with suppliers distributed among 25 [LOC U.S.  ] states , and estimates that more than 7,000 [LOC U.S.  ] jobs were either created or maintained in 2005 from a component purchase . 
More than 1200 aircraft have been sold to the [LOC U.S.  ] , including 345 turboprops and about 800 jets . 
Airline customers include [MISC American Eagle  ] , [ORG Continental Express  ] , [ORG Republic Airways  ] , [LOC Midwest  ] , [LOC Tran States  ] , [LOC Mesa  ] , [LOC Gecas  ] , [ORG US Airways  ] , and [ORG Jet Blue  ] . 
[PER Botelho  ] characterized the 70-80 , 100 , and 126-seat jets as " small big jets " , saying they really don't meet the criteria of regional jets anymore given their passenger capacity and comfort . 
INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE AND " PROTECTING THE CAMP " <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) According to [PER Botelho  ] , the history of [ORG Embraer  ] shows a successful evolution from a state-owned enterprise to privately held corporation . 
State-owned until December , 1994 , it was privatized in 1995 , when current management took control . 
In 1997 , it reached break-even in terms of profitability , and since then has steadily grown . 
[ORG Embraer  ] employs 19,000 employees worldwide , including 3,000 outside of [LOC Brazil  ] , and has more than 4,000 engineers . 
From 2001 to 2005 , about 540 engineers graduated with master 's degrees specializing in aeronautical engineering , all paid for by [ORG Embraer  ] . 
As [PER Botelho  ] says , " it 's a business based on knowledge . 
" The [LOC RIO DE JAN  ] 00000601 002 OF 003 Ambassador complimented [PER Botelho  ] on training some of the world 's best engineers and observed that [ORG Embraer  ] is currently suing [ORG Gulfstream  ] for recruiting some of them away . 
[PER Botelho  ] said , laughing , " the Admiral will understand this . 
We have to protect our camp . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Adm. Giambastiani  ] acknowledged that skilled people are in tremendous demand , and asked what had brought [ORG Embraer  ] to the decision to provide the training . 
[PER Botelho  ] said that they had analyzed the situation and realized there was not enough flow in [MISC Brazilian  ] universities to supply the demand . 
It was not the level or quality of education available ; [ORG Embraer  ] 's parastatal parent was created in the 1950s , and its first dean had previously been the head of the aeronautics department at [LOC MIT  ] , so it was created with the same curriculum and standards . 
" But , " said [PER Botelho  ] , " Competition is heavy . 
The investment banking sector takes a lot of our engineers away . 
. . it is really our biggest competitor . 
" COMPANY STRUCTURE <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG Embraer  ] restricts voting power to five percent for any shareholder , and limits foreign ownership to that of 2/3 of the [MISC Brazilian  ] shareholders . 
[PER Botelho  ] indicated that if any shareholder reached 35 percent , [ORG Embraer  ] would be forced to open the company to a 100 percent public offering . 
The GOB retains one voting share , to assure veto power on such proposals as new military programs , transfer of technology to other countries , changes in the bylaws , and the ability of someone else to purchase the company . 
However , said [PER Botelho  ] , even if a prospective buyer could achieve government buy-in , the company is further protected: the prospective buyer has to meet an asking price that is the value of the company plus 50 percent . 
As [PER Botelho  ] said , " That makes it less attractive . 
" [ORG Embraer  ] shares are traded on the [MISC NYSE  ] and [LOC Sao Paulo Stock Exchange  ] at 60 percent and 40 percent of its shares , respectively-further protection through market diversification . 
FROM CORPORATE JETS . . . <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The Ambassador turned the conversation to small , private business jets . 
[PER Botelho  ] said that five years ago , [ORG Embraer  ] launched the Legacy aircraft , with the intent to understand and learn how the market for small , executive jets works . 
They " learned a lot , " and the [MISC Legacy-600  ] was born . 
From there , they launched a couple of new product lines with specialized or niche markets . 
They do not plan to build large numbers of these craft , but the intent is to " show the market that they are following demand . 
" They are also competing effectively with larger and/or more expensive aircraft in terms of comfort and features offered ; Legacy aircraft are being very well received , with about 320 orders so far , projected to be ready in two tranches in mid-2008 and mid-2009 . 
The executive jet market is growing , and [PER Botelho  ] believes it will keep growing . 
As for defense , he sees that as a " niche operation , with some opportunities . 
" TO POSSIBLE DEFENSE SALES TO THE [ORG USG  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Admiral stated that while he does not negotiate contracts , he would be happy to respond to [ORG Embraer  ] 's questions regarding the direction in which the [LOC US  ] is moving , in particular with respect to intelligence , reconnaissance and surveillance ( ISR ) aerial manned platforms . 
[PER Adm. Giambastiani  ] explained to [ORG Embraer  ] President [PER Botelho  ] and Vice President [PER Aguiar  ] that he is co-chairman of the USG 's [ORG Defense Acquisition Board  ] and that all programs for acquisition go through the [ORG Board  ] . 
While there are a variety of other mechanisms within OSD for contract solicitation , no programs can go through without the [ORG Board  ] 's approval. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Botelho  ] said that [ORG Embraer  ] looks at the defense market not so much as competing with [LOC U.S.  ] firms , but complementing [LOC U.S.  ] partners in competing for defense work . 
The reliability of its originally proposed [MISC Aerial Common Sensor  ] ( ACS ) aircraft [ E-145 ] is estimated at 99.75 percent . 
With prime contractor [PER Lockheed Martin  ] , [ORG Embraer  ] had been contracted to deliver 38 aircraft for the [ORG US Army  ] , [LOC RIO DE JAN  ] 00000601 003 OF 003 and 19 aircraft for the [ORG US Navy  ] , with deliveries anticipated from 2009 to 2017 . 
The contract was awarded in August 2004 and terminated in Jan. 2006 . 
[PER Botelho  ] said that by the time the contract was awarded , the ACS platform complied in total with stated requirements , but when the program became Joint with the [ORG Navy  ] and requirements grew , it became evident that the E-145 could not meet the increased weight , power and cooling requirements . 
[ORG Embraer  ] worked rapidly and flexibly to offer the larger [MISC E-190  ] instead , but it was not feasible to effect the mission payload integration within the costs of the program and the contract was terminated by the [ORG Army  ] . 
It " would have been a big hit for [ORG Embraer  ] to serve the [LOC U.S.  ] government and to open new opportunities abroad , " [PER Botelho  ] said ruefully . 
As he put it , " Our situation today is that we have the conditions to keep supplying value . 
Where and how are the questions . 
I honestly do not know if there is additional opportunity , and would like to hear from the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Admiral noted that a series of studies was commissioned in the [LOC U.S.  ] as to whether manned or unmanned platforms would meet future military requirements . 
Unmanned platforms do not meet all those needs , so there will be a program for a manned ISR platform . 
However , the program will be Joint from its inception , incorporating all [ORG Army  ] and [ORG Navy  ] needs up front . 
He said , " You will see the [LOC U.S.  ] come back in for solicitations and bids in 2007 , " cautioning once again that he does not handle that , but will be reviewing requirements and cost drivers . 
But as he said , " We are serious about the program . 
But it must be a joint program , a joint operation , and a common platform . 
" The Admiral stressed that the [LOC U.S.  ] military 's focus for the future would be capability , reliability , and cost effectiveness , including examining long-term life cycle costs and energy efficiency . 
[PER Botelho  ] closed by saying " We will compete strongly ! 
" <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) This cable was cleared by Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] and Admiral [PER Giambastiani  ] 's staff .
