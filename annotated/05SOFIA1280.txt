( C ) [MISC Summary: Through  ] surveillance , arrests and other methods , the [ORG GOF  ] prevents or puts out brushfires of [MISC Islamic  ] extremism on an almost daily basis , and has been doing so for decades . 
According to recent press reports , the [ORG RG  ] , [LOC France  ] 's police intelligence service , estimates that 6 million [MISC Muslims  ] live in [LOC France  ] , approximately 10 percent of the population . 
The [ORG RG  ] estimates that approximately 9,000 of them might be extremist . 
These numbers , coupled with a widespread recognition that [LOC France  ] continues to struggle mightily to integrate its immigrant/Muslim population , provide a sober counterpoint to the past success and unquestionable capabilities of the counter-terrorism apparatus . 
Although in the short and medium-term , [LOC France  ] clearly can rely on its police , security and judicial services to aggressively combat terrorism , in the long-term it must focus on giving a place to [MISC Muslims  ] ( be they first-generation immigrants , their second- and third-generation children , or the growing number of converts ) in the [MISC French  ] identity . 
End summary . 
THE POTENTIAL OF [MISC ISLAMIC  ] EXTREMISM ---------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In the [MISC Muslim  ] community of some six million , 70 percent are estimated to be of [MISC North African  ] ( [LOC Algeria  ] , [LOC Morocco  ] , and [LOC Tunisia  ] ) origin . 
Other sizable groups include [LOC Turks  ] and [MISC Pakistanis  ] . 
Within this overall population , the [ORG RG  ] estimates ( according to recent press reports ) that roughly 9,000 could be considered extremist , or , just over one-tenth of one percent . 
The [ORG RG  ] also estimated that of the 1,500 mosques and prayer halls in [LOC France  ] , fewer than 40 were considered extremist . 
[ORG GOF  ] officials routinely claim that 90 percent of [MISC French Muslims  ] are non-practicing . 
Among the minority of [MISC French  ] [MISC Muslims  ] considered " practicing , " there is a small but distinct current of fundamentalist thought . 
On August 5 , [PER Poloffs  ] toured a number of [MISC Islamic  ] bookshops in [LOC Paris  ] , and found that the literature extolled strongly conservative views on the role of [MISC Muslim  ] women and also included numerous guides ( in [MISC French  ] ) of how to pray . 
The bookstores did not present any moderate alternatives to conservative dogma. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Two specific sources of [MISC Islamic  ] extremism are of special interest . 
First is the [MISC French  ] prison system , with a population that is estimated at over 50 percent [MISC Muslim  ] . 
According to another leaked [ORG RG  ] report from May 2005 , [MISC Islamic  ] extremism here is growing in popularity , with scattered reports of prisoners hanging up posters of [PER Bin Laden  ] , destroying [MISC Christmas  ] trees and bibles , and cries of joy at the news of [MISC American  ] soldiers killed in [LOC Iraq  ] or suicide bombings in [LOC Israel  ] . 
It is often the shock of prison , detailed the [ORG RG  ] report , that transforms petty criminals into [MISC Islamic  ] extremists . 
The shortage of [MISC Muslim  ] chaplains in [MISC French  ] prisons fuels potential for extremist ideologies to spread unabated . 
Radicalized prisoners , once released , are " time bombs , " said the [ORG RG  ] report . 
It estimated that within the prison system , 200 inmates " merit attention , " and 95 of these should be considered " dangerous . 
" A second source of [MISC Islamic  ] extremism is the growing number of conversions to radical [MISC Islam  ] by European-origin [MISC French  ] citizens . 
In a report submitted to Interior Minister [PER Sarkozy  ] in June , the [ORG RG  ] profiled new [MISC French  ] converts to [MISC Islam  ] , and found that most were young males in urban areas and/or in areas largely populated by those of [MISC North African  ] descent . 
Of those converts profiled , the [ORG RG  ] reported 49 percent did not have any diploma , and a full 44 percent opted for Salafist or Tabligh-inspired versions of fundamentalist [MISC Islam  ] . 
The unemployment rate among new converts of [MISC European-French  ] origin is five times the national average , according to the [ORG RG  ] report . 
More than ten percent of the new converts had discovered [MISC Islam  ] in prison . 
The [ORG RG  ] report also revealed that approximately 3.5 percent of the [MISC French  ] military , including officers , had converted to [MISC Islam  ] . 
( Note: Although this is a striking statistic , many military converts have presumably done so in order to marry [MISC Muslims  ] , and not necessarily for ideological reasons . 
End note . 
) FRANCE'S LONG HISTORY WITH [MISC ISLAMIC  ] EXTREMISM -------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The sheer number of recent " terrorism conspiracy " arrests in [LOC France  ] involving [MISC Islamic  ] extremists underscores the [ORG GOF  ] 's counter-terrorism challenges . 
Since 2002 , it has arrested 322 people linked to terrorism , of whom 91 were charged and imprisoned . 
[MISC Islamic  ] extremist violence has struck [LOC France  ] in the past , especially [LOC Paris  ] . 
A year after a failed hijacking attempt of an Air [LOC France  ] jet in 1994 , the [MISC Algerian  ] terrorist group [ORG GIA  ] conducted a wave of bombings in [LOC Paris  ] subway stations and landmarks , killing 8 and wounding over 200 . 
Spillover from [MISC Maghreb-based Islamic  ] extremists continues to this day , with the [MISC Algerian-based  ] [ORG GSPC  ] group and the [MISC Moroccan-based  ] [ORG GICM  ] group both present covertly on [MISC French  ] soil . 
Furthermore , [MISC French  ] intelligence believes that the [ORG GSPC  ] has increasingly taken on the goals of worldwide jihadism and is seeking to position itself as a complement to al-Qaida . 
A terrorism investigating judge told us recently that the [ORG GSPC  ] is expanding its reach in [LOC France  ] , and is working to take advantage of old connections within the well-organized [MISC Algerian  ] community . 
As for the [ORG GICM  ] , [MISC French  ] judiciary officials told us that those arrested in 2004 were frighteningly professional and maintain to this day a strict discipline when interrogated ( ref D ) . 
( Comment: The [ORG GOF  ] prides itself on its ability to keep tabs on extremist groups ; their discovery of the [ORG GICM  ] cell shocked them because they had stumbled upon it by chance , further evidence of the [ORG GICM  ] group 's operational security . 
End comment . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) [LOC France  ] has also seen [MISC Islamic  ] extremist cells appear with seemingly little to no support from terrorist organizations such as the [ORG GICM  ] and the [ORG GSPC  ] . 
One example is the eleven " jihadists to [LOC Iraq  ] " arrested in January in [LOC Paris'  ] 19th arrondissement . 
Those involved were arrested days before leaving for [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The DST told USG interlocutors ( ref E ) that the suspected ringleader , 23-year old [PER Farid Benyettou  ] , had never studied theology but by force of personality , had managed within a few months to convince a group of teenagers to fight jihad in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
One example that demonstrates the fluid interconnectedness of many [MISC Islamic  ] extremists was revealed during the trial of [PER Ahmed Laidouni  ] and [PER David Courtailler  ] , two [MISC French  ] citizens convicted and sentenced in 2004 for organizing recruitment networks for terrorist training camps in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Laidouni  ] and [PER Courtailler  ] ( who converted at the age of 27 to fundamentalist [MISC Islam  ] ) have been linked to members of the [MISC Beghal  ] network that were convicted in March 2005 of plotting to bomb the [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy in [LOC Paris  ] ( ref F ) . 
They have also been linked to extremist circles in the [LOC UK  ] . 
Members of the [MISC Beghal  ] network are suspected of having ties with ( among others ) members of the " [MISC Chechen  ] " network ( a loose grouping of individuals from [LOC Lyon  ] that attempted to develop chemical agents to commit terrorist attacks ) , the " [LOC Frankfurt  ] " network ( which attempted in 2000 to attack cultural sites in [LOC Strasbourg  ] ) , and [PER Lionel Dumont  ] , a member of the [MISC Islamic  ] extremist " Roubaix gang " that in the late 1990s terrorized the north of [LOC France  ] . 
[PER Dumont  ] spent a number of years in [LOC Japan  ] , and is suspected of building links there to [MISC Islamic  ] extremism . 
In short , [MISC Islamic  ] political extremism in [LOC France  ] takes on many forms: it has bubbled up on its own , in cooperation with other autonomous groups , and also in cooperation with al-Qaida linked groups such as the [LOC GSPC.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Islamic  ] extremism is connected in the public mind to the poor suburbs outside of major [MISC French  ] cities , especially [LOC Paris  ] , [LOC Lyon  ] , [LOC Strasbourg  ] and [LOC Marseilles  ] . 
However , pockets of low-income housing are scattered throughout [LOC France  ] , and recent arrests in [LOC Grenoble  ] , a medium-sized university town in the southeast , and [PER Lorraine  ] , a region near the [MISC French-German  ] border , illustrate the fact that [MISC Islamic  ] extremism is not confined to the suburbs of [LOC France  ] 's largest cities . 
[MISC French  ] residents and citizens of [MISC North African  ] extraction are scattered throughout [LOC France  ] . 
The [MISC Turkish  ] community is based largely in [LOC Paris  ] and in eastern [LOC France  ] , and the [MISC Pakistani  ] community is based almost exclusively in the [LOC Paris  ] metropolitan area . 
THE GOVERNMENT AS FIREFIGHTER ----------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Although attention since the July bombings in [LOC London  ] and [LOC Sharm el-Sheikh  ] is on new enforcement and security initiatives , the [ORG GOF  ] continues its work to integrate the [MISC Muslim  ] community into what is still a historically [MISC Catholic  ] country . 
High-profile [MISC Muslims  ] in government , politics and culture are relatively rare , and in general , [MISC Muslims  ] are underrepresented in positions of power . 
The [ORG GOF  ] reached back into its history of dealing with other religious/ethnic communities when in 2003 it created the Council for the [MISC Muslim  ] [ORG Faith  ] ( [ORG CFCM  ] ) , an umbrella organization of various [MISC Muslim  ] groups which serves as the official [MISC French  ] [MISC Muslim  ] interlocutor with the government on a range of civil-religious issues , including mosque construction . 
The [ORG CFCM  ] includes a broad brush of [MISC Muslim  ] groups , including the fundamentalist-leaning [ORG UOIF  ] ( considered by some to have links to the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] ) , the [ORG FMNF  ] ( also considered fundamentalist , but backed by the [MISC Moroccan  ] government ) , and the [PER Tabligh  ] ( an ultra-orthodox [MISC Pakistani  ] origin group described as a way-station for some [MISC French  ] jihadists ) . 
[ORG GOF  ] officials also point out that around 40 percent of [MISC French  ] mosques are not CFCM-affiliated . 
Moreover , the [ORG CFCM  ] is riddled with internal conflict ( ref C ) , and for many who espouse a highly fundamentalist worldview , it is considered too close to the [LOC GOF.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) Another [ORG GOF  ] initiative to spur the growth of a moderate , France-centric [MISC Islam  ] is to encourage imams to speak [MISC French  ] and learn more about [MISC French  ] culture . 
More than half of the imams in [LOC France  ] either do not speak [MISC French  ] or speak it very poorly . 
In addition , less than 20 percent have [MISC French  ] nationality . 
New immigration policies stipulate that those wishing to attain [MISC French  ] citizenship must receive a [ORG GOF  ] certification of [MISC French  ] fluency . 
Although this new policy does not specifically target imams , their participation is encouraged . 
A similar initiative , proposed by PM [PER Villepin  ] when he was Interior Minister , has been stymied . 
[PER Villepin  ] said he would push [MISC French  ] universities to inaugurate specific courses for imams on [MISC French  ] culture . 
Only the [ORG Sorbonne  ] university evinced any interest , although it finally announced in early August that it would not proceed with the imam program because it ran counter to the principles of secularism . 
ALTHOUGH CONFIDENT IN ITS " OFFENSIVE " C/T STRATEGY , [LOC FRANCE  ] STILL STRUGGLES WITH INTEGRATION --------------------------------------------- ------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) Notwithstanding the recent spurt of [ORG GOF  ] counter-terrorism proposals ( ref B ) , the [MISC French  ] government and media generally believe the [ORG GOF  ] 's method of fighting [MISC Islamic  ] extremism works well . 
A July 12 article in [ORG Le Figaro  ] outlined the two basic approaches , [LOC France  ] 's " offensive " strategy and the [LOC UK  ] 's " communitarian " strategy . 
[PER Louis Caprioli  ] , former head of the DST 's counter-terrorism bureau ( the DST is [LOC France  ] 's internal security service ) , said the [MISC French  ] strategy emphasizes total cooperation between the security/police services and the specialized counter-terrorism judiciary . 
This allows for constant surveillance of suspects and a focus on maximum disturbance of [MISC Islamic  ] extremists , hence the " offensive " nature of the strategy . 
[PER Alain Chouet  ] , former head of the [ORG DGSE  ] ( [LOC France  ] 's external intelligence service ) , added that the presence of the [ORG RG  ] throughout [MISC French  ] territory allows for " permanent surveillance and penetration of problematic communities . 
" Furthermore , said [PER Chouet  ] , " It is hard to imagine the [MISC Anglo-Saxon  ] countries imitating our harassment tactics , which sometimes take place without any real proof of wrongdoing . 
" ( Comment: There is undoubtedly a whiff of traditional [MISC Gallic  ] competitiveness regarding the " [MISC Anglo-Saxons  ] " in these comparisons of counter-terrorism models . 
Of all those calling for additional C/T proposals in [LOC France  ] following the July attacks , only the unabashedly pro-Anglo-Saxon [PER Sarkozy  ] pointedly said [LOC France  ] had something to learn from the [MISC British  ] public transport surveillance system . 
End comment ) <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) Although most believe the [ORG GOF  ] 's " offensive " counter-terrorism approach has been successful , many consider that the [ORG GOF  ] has failed in its quest to integrate those in the marginalized suburbs , or " cites " . 
[PER Jean-Marie Colombani  ] , the editor-in-chief of [ORG Le Monde  ] , wrote in a rare front-page editorial on July 26: " Stories abound of the young , born in our 'cites , ' that incomprehensibly swung from complete integration to marginalization to then becoming irretrievable . 
" [PER Guillaume Bigot  ] , a [MISC French  ] researcher who recently co-wrote a well-reviewed book on [MISC Islamic  ] extremism in [LOC France  ] , is even more biting: " The [MISC Muslim  ] community in [LOC France...is  ] massively excluded at the social and economic level , and is accustomed to a sense of humiliation . 
These youth , whose first or last names become obstacles to finding work , do not have a past or a feeling of belonging to a land , and have absolutely no future . 
It is not necessary to invent a [PER James Bond  ] of [MISC Islamist  ] extremism . 
You only need people who can be manipulated with a simplistic ideology . 
" <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Poloffs recently visited the northern [LOC Paris  ] suburb of [ORG La Courneuve  ] , which has recently become a living metaphor for violence and [MISC Islamic  ] extremism in [LOC France  ] . 
Interior Minister [PER Sarkozy  ] visited [ORG La Courneuve  ] several times over the past months , and has vowed to make it an example of his new efforts to foster integration . 
Members of the " [MISC Chechen  ] " network ( see para 6 ) were arrested there in 2002 with explosive material and the chemical agent ricin . 
Originally a small town independent from [LOC Paris  ] , [ORG La Courneuve  ] now features many large HLM ( low-income housing projects ) . 
The streets are relatively wide and empty , with little street-level commerce aside from government services and larger supermarkets . 
No one background dominated and we saw no visible signs of an [MISC Islamic  ] presence ( we passed only one synagogue and no mosques ) . 
The suburb did not feel dangerous ; instead it seemed more bleak and deserted than anything else , as if everybody was inside their apartments or out of town . 
Satellite dishes sprouted from many apartments . 
The presence of planters with flowers and tree-lined sidewalks gave the impression of a municipal government trying to improve the area . 
Indeed , the local government 's slogan was " [ORG La Courneuve  ] is inventing another future for itself . 
" Overall , and despite its terrible reputation , [ORG La Courneuve  ] looked to be a modest , multicultural place . 
Its appearance confirmed what statistics report: the overwhelming majority of [MISC Muslims  ] in [LOC France  ] ( whether from [LOC Africa  ] , the [LOC Maghreb  ] , or the newly converted ) are moderate . 
The problem lies with the one or two apartments that harbor [MISC Islamic  ] extremists hidden within the tens of thousands that do not. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Comment: As is widely recognized , the [ORG GOF  ] wields a muscular and effective counter-terrorism apparatus that identifies potential terrorists and thwarts potential terrorist operations . 
Although there is always room for improvement , the [ORG GOF  ] appears to have done what it can in the short- and medium-term to combat [MISC Islamic  ] extremism . 
Over the long-term , however , much work needs to be done . 
[LOC France  ] does not only have an integration/immigration problem ; it must also work to give a place to [MISC Muslims  ] in the [MISC French  ] identity . 
Despite claims that its commitment to secularism nullifies prejudice against any religion , it is an open secret that historically Catholic [LOC France  ] has heretofore failed to muster sufficient will and understanding to truly accept [MISC Muslims  ] as [MISC French  ] citizens . 
Although [MISC Islamic  ] extremism may never completely disappear from [LOC France  ] , acceptance of [MISC Muslims  ] as full , participating members of [MISC French  ] society will go a long way to minimizing its reach .
