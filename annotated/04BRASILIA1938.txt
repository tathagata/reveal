Hearne  ] for Reasons 1.5a <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary and Introduction . 
On July 30 , a [MISC State/DoD  ] delegation , led by [ORG WHA  ] PDAS [PER James Derham  ] , met with [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] interlocutors to discuss mechanisms through which the [ORG GOB  ] would provide information to the [ORG USG  ] about the status of [LOC Brazil  ] , s shootdown program once that program begins . 
The two sides generated a working text that would provide the [ORG USG  ] timely access to [ORG GOB  ] data ( i.e. , reports and video/audio tape ) in cases where [MISC Brazilian  ] interceptors employed lethal force . 
In addition , the [ORG GOB  ] committed to providing the [ORG USG  ] with: a ) notification of any substantial changes to program procedures and training requirements , and b ) the opportunity for periodic consultations that might address the number of events that stop short of lethal force and the date and location of such events. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Both sides agreed to take the working text back to their respective interagency processes for a more complete review . 
The [ORG GOB  ] will produce , in [MISC Portuguese  ] , the official version of the working text , by the middle of the week of August 2 . 
State will generate an [MISC English  ] version of that document shortly thereafter . 
The [ORG USG  ] delegation proposed that , when finalized , the document and two annexes that detailed the [ORG GOB  ] 's procedures , would serve as attachments to an exchange of diplomatic notes , that would be initiated by the [ORG GOB  ] . 
In its current form , the exchange would represent a political commitment on the part of the [ORG GOB  ] , as opposed to a binding international agreement . 
End Summary and [MISC Introduction.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Fernando Abreu  ] , Chief of Staff of Defense Minister [PER Viegas  ] , led the [MISC Brazilian  ] delegation , which consisted of [PER Orlando Almeida  ] ( Special Advisor to [PER Viegas  ] ) , [ORG Air Force Brigadier General  ] [PER Machado  ] ( [ORG Sub-Chief of Operations  ] of the [ORG MOD Joint  ] Staff ) , and [ORG Air Force Colonel Servan  ] ( Vice-Chief of the [ORG GOB Air Defense Command  ] ) . 
After welcoming remarks , [PER Abreu  ] noted that the [ORG GOB  ] planned to initiate its shootdown program on October 17 , with great emphasis being placed on transparency for both the [MISC Brazilian  ] public and foreign governments . 
He then turned the floor over to General [PER Machado  ] , who launched into an extended description of [LOC Brazil  ] , s air defense infrastructure and the procedural safeguards associated with the [ORG GOB  ] , s implementation of shootdown . 
In particular , [PER Machado  ] noted that: -- Since 1979 , the [ORG GOB  ] had been safely conducting air interceptions ( i.e. , approaches short of lethal force ) , and was well aware of the need to scrupulously observe [ORG ICAO  ] requirements during the course of aerial interception . 
The use of lethal force , he emphasized , was merely an extension of the [ORG GOB  ] , s current interception efforts . 
-- [LOC Brazil  ] , s operational norms for its airspace defense system were contained in a large classified document known as the [ORG NOSDA  ] ( the [MISC Portuguese  ] acronym ) . 
Though the [ORG Air Force  ] was not able to provide the [ORG USG  ] with a copy of the [ORG NOSDA  ] , he emphasized that the documents that were passed to the delegation representatives during the course of the July 29 talks , in addition to the [ORG GOB  ] 's two sets of responses to the [ORG USG  ] 's questions about [ORG GOB  ] shootdown procedures , were accurate summaries of the contents of the [ORG NOSDA  ] . 
( In brief , these summaries describe a process of detection , monitoring , identification , interrogation , investigation , and warnings prior to the use of lethal force , as well as the procedures and circumstances under which the [ORG GOB  ] would use lethal force ) . 
-- The use of both warning shots and lethal force would only be authorized by the Commander of [LOC Brazil  ] , s central air defense center . 
Lethal force would only be employed in cases where intel information indicated that the suspect air track was tied to narco-trafficking . 
-- The co-location of civil aviation facilities with military controllers , along with reliance on a common [ORG Air Force  ] radar feed , facilitates the identification of routine civil aviation traffic . 
-- The [ORG GOB  ] plans to conduct an extensive media campaign , using television and radio spots , sporting events , and notices to airmen ( NOTAMs ) to publicize the contemplated October 17 initiation of its shootdown program . 
A parallel effort would be aimed at the international public as well . 
-- The training regime for program personnel includes training for pilots , air controllers , and communications personnel . 
In particular , he noted , those pilots who conduct air interceptions receive more extensive and specialized training than their non-interception counterparts. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Subsequent discussion then refined the mechanism through which the [ORG USG  ] would receive information about program events . 
[PER Abreu  ] noted that the [ORG GOB  ] was open to passing comprehensive information to the [ORG USG  ] on an informal basis , but that any arrangement that smacked of [ORG USG  ] intrusion into [MISC Brazilian  ] sovereignty was a non-starter , given the potentially negative reaction by the [LOC Brazil  ] congress and public . 
Still , [PER Abreu  ] pledged that the [ORG GOB  ] would: -- provide , on an urgent basis , the [ORG AmEmbassy Brasilia Air Force Attache  ] with information regarding any shootdown incident . 
Such information would be provided to the general public as well . 
-- At the [ORG USG  ] , s request , meet with [ORG USG  ] representatives to provide background information about the program , s progress ( i.e. , the number of suspect tracks detected , interceptions , and warning shots as well as other similar data ) , and -- notify the [ORG USG  ] of any changes in security procedures , non-classified checklists , flight plan requirements , and training regimen. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Begin Comment  ] . 
As a result of these discussions , it is clear that -- other than for information on shootdown events -- the [ORG USG  ] will have to initiate contacts with the [ORG GOB  ] when securing information on the shootdown program . 
It may be worthwhile for [ORG USG  ] agencies to: a ) establish a checklist of information that they would like the [ORG AmEmbassy Brasilia Air Force Attache  ] to obtain , b ) and provide guidance on the frequency with which the Attache should seek consultations with the [ORG GOB  ] . 
End Comment. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) PDAS [PER Derham  ] proposed that the two sides ultimately document the understanding reached regarding information sharing through an exchange of diplomatic notes . 
The diplomatic notes would expressly reference three attachments: the GOP responses to the first and second set of questions from the [ORG USG  ] regarding [ORG GOB  ] operational procedures and the working text that was the subject of this round of discussions . 
The diplomatic note would also reflect the [ORG GOB  ] 's assurances that the shootdown program would only be directed at aircraft reasonably suspected to be primarily engaged in illicit drug trafficking . 
The [ORG GOB  ] clarified that this meant that aircraft carrying drugs or aircraft carrying money , weapons , or precursor chemicals to exchange for drugs could be subject to lethal force . 
( The scope of the [ORG GOB  ] 's program thus falls within the scope of the 22 [MISC U.S.C.  ] 2291-4 , i.e. , the immunity statute , as further articulated by [ORG DOJ  ] in the context of the [LOC Colombia  ] ABD program . 
) <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Abreu  ] was open to the idea of an exchange of diplomatic notes , though he indicated that he would need to check with others ( in particular , Minister of Defense [PER Viegas  ] ) prior to providing us with the [ORG GOB  ] , s formal answer . 
Both sides then explored possible language for inclusion in the exchange of diplomatic notes ( which would be initiated by the [ORG GOB  ] ) . 
For [PER Abreu  ] , a red-line was any language which indicated that the exchange of diplomatic notes would be a binding international agreement , as that would mean that the text would need to be approved by the [MISC Brazilian  ] congress . 
WHA PDAS [PER Derham  ] cleared message .
