[LOC BEIRUT  ] 53 B. 09 [LOC BEIRUT  ] 974 C. 09 [LOC BEIRUT  ] 1334 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Michele J. Sison  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: [ORG UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon  ] ( [ORG UNSCOL  ] ) [PER Michael Williams  ] shared with the Ambassador on January 27 a disturbing report of a January 23 act of aggression against a [ORG UN Interim Force in Lebanon  ] ( [ORG UNIFIL  ] ) foot patrol in the southern [MISC Lebanese  ] town of [LOC Bint Jbeil  ] involving an angry crowd and denial of the [ORG UNIFIL  ] patrol’s freedom of movement . 
[PER Williams  ] called the incident “clearly worrying” because of its quick escalation and its occurrence during a routine patrol . 
Following his January 24-26 consultations in [LOC Israel  ] , [PER Williams  ] also questioned the GOI’s commitment to withdrawal from the occupied [MISC Lebanese  ] village of [LOC Ghajar  ] . 
While [PER Williams  ] concluded that the GOI did not expect an immediate conflict with [ORG Hizballah  ] , he reported it still harbored deep concern about potentially destabilizing factors in south [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
Even so , the [ORG Israeli Defense Forces  ] ( [ORG IDF  ] ) praised its relationship with the [ORG Lebanese Armed Forces  ] ( [ORG LAF  ] ) via the [MISC Tripartite  ] mechanism . 
On [ORG UN Security Council Resolution  ] ( [ORG UNSCR  ] ) 1559 , [PER Williams  ] argued against the insistence of some [MISC Lebanese  ] that the resolution be “canceled , ” noting “the big elephant in the room is [ORG Hizballah  ] End Summary . 
ROUTINE PATROL OBSTRUCTED , INCIDENT ESCALATED --------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The “temporary obstruction” of UNIFIL’s movement January 23 in the southern town of [LOC Bint Jbeil  ] was a violation of [ORG UNSCR  ] 1701 , UNSCOL [PER Michael Williams  ] told the Ambassador on January 27 , since any denial of UNIFIL’s movement was considered a violation . 
At approximately 1100 on January 23 , members of an eight-man [MISC French  ] [ORG UNIFIL  ] foot patrol noticed that they were being photographed by individuals following them in a civilian vehicle . 
Soon after a [ORG UNIFIL  ] soldier wrote down the car’s license plate number , a crowd of approximately 50 people -- some armed with baseball bats , metal bars , and one individual with a knife -- formed around the [ORG UNIFIL  ] soldiers . 
The soldier’s notebook was seized by a member of the crowd and set ablaze with kerosene . 
After the crowd tried to isolate one of the [ORG UNIFIL  ] soldiers in a threatening manner , the patrol fired warning shots . 
While the members of the [ORG LAF  ] were present , it is not clear what role they played . 
Reportedly , one of the [ORG LAF  ] soldiers told his [ORG UNIFIL  ] counterpart that [ORG UNIFIL  ] needed to “respect the ( local residents’ ) rights as civilians.” <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Williams  ] characterized the incident as “clearly worrying.” It was “very unusual , ” he emphasized , for local residents to exhibit such behavior during the course of routine patrols , especially because the [ORG UNIFIL  ] unit was not headed to search someone’s home . 
When asked for his assessment of the [MISC LAF’s  ] and UNIFIL’s renewed commitment to work together more closely after several incidents in the second half of 2009 , [PER Williams  ] replied it was not yet clear what specific steps had been taken to improve the relationship . 
DEALBREAKERS ON GHAJAR REMAIN UNRESOLVED ---------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) UNIFIL’s January 25 meeting with the GOI [LOC Ghajar  ] team was positive , [ORG UNIFIL  ] polchief [PER Milos Strugar  ] told polchief separately on January 26 . 
The [MISC Israeli  ] team had visited the village , spoken with residents and local leaders , and inspected infrastructure since their last meeting , so they had a more comprehensive picture of the issues involved , he underscored . 
On January 25 , the [MISC Israelis  ] made a presentation on humanitarian issues to be addressed , [PER Strugar  ] said , but they did not return to discuss the key security and legal jurisdictional concerns they had raised previously ( ref A ) . 
[PER Strugar  ] , who had been downcast after the [MISC Israelis  ] presented a maximalist position on January 7 , was more upbeat , although he assessed that the talks would progress slowly despite what he described as “an effort” on the [MISC Israeli  ] side. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The next meeting between [ORG UNIFIL  ] and the GOI on [LOC Ghajar  ] would be held in approximately two weeks due to the disruption caused by the handover of [ORG UNIFIL  ] , s command from [MISC Italian  ] General [PER Claudio Graziano  ] to [MISC Spanish  ] General [PER Alberto Asarta Cuevas  ] , [PER Strugar  ] noted . 
In his final [MISC Tripartite  ] meeting on January 25 , which [PER Cuevas  ] attended , [PER Graziano  ] laid out the history of the [LOC Ghajar  ] issue and described the current status of negotiations , [PER Strugar  ] said . 
His comments , in memorandum form , would be the basis for [PER Asarta  ] going forward , [PER Strugar  ] explained . 
[PER Williams  ] believed [PER Asarta  ] shared Graziano’s understanding of the importance of resolving [LOC Ghajar  ] , although [PER Graziano  ] had invested a great deal of his personal capital on the issue. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In his meeting in [LOC Jerusalem  ] , [PER Strugar  ] reported , [PER Graziano  ] conveyed his concerns regarding the [MISC Israeli  ] presentation made on January 7 and urged the [MISC Israelis  ] to return to the [ORG UNIFIL  ] plan as a basis for progress . 
[PER Strugar  ] described the [MISC Israelis  ] as “open” and said that [ORG MFA  ] DG [PER Yossi Gal  ] emphasized that the previous [MISC Israeli  ] presentation was “just a starting point.” The [MISC Israelis  ] will return to the [ORG UNIFIL  ] plan as a basis , [PER Strugar  ] predicted , although he believed that the legal and jurisdictional questions at stake -- not the security ones -- would be difficult to resolve . 
Before the next meeting , [ORG UNIFIL  ] would brief the [MISC Lebanese  ] on the negotiations , as well , [PER Strugar  ] confirmed . 
[PER UNSCOL Williams  ] told the Ambassador that it was his impression that no progress had been made on the legal or security questions raised with respect to [LOC Ghajar  ] , terming the remaining concerns “dealbreakers.” <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) After Williams’ January 24-26 consultations in [LOC Israel  ] , he believed that [LOC Israel  ] was “looking for something” from [LOC Lebanon  ] before withdrawing from [LOC Ghajar  ] . 
[PER Williams  ] relayed that the [MISC Israelis  ] did not specify what that “something” could be , but in any case , he was not convinced that the [ORG GOL  ] had the political cover -- or inclination -- to negotiate seriously over [LOC Ghajar  ] . 
He noted that the [MISC Israeli  ] [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] seemed more “flexible” on the issue , while he questioned whether the [ORG MFA  ] ( the lead agency ) was really committed . 
MOD General [PER Yossi Heymann  ] , whom [PER Williams  ] called “impressive , ” believed that the issue of [LOC Ghajar  ] was suffering from “over legislation” and that sometimes it was better to “have some gray.” When [LOC Israel  ] pulled out of [LOC Ghajar  ] in 2000 , there were no detailed arrangements and it “kind of” worked , [PER Heymann  ] pointed out . 
[PER Williams  ] said he assured his [MISC Israeli  ] interlocutors that after an [MISC Israeli  ] withdrawal from [LOC Ghajar  ] , he would “do ( his ) damnedest” to push the [MISC Lebanese  ] to take reciprocal positive steps in accordance with their [ORG UNSCR  ] 1701 obligations . 
[MISC ISRAELI  ] CONCERNS IN [LOC LEBANON  ] --------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Williams  ] reported that while in [LOC Israel  ] , he had met with not only Gal and [PER Heymann  ] , but also with representatives of Prime Minister Netanyahu’s office , as well as MOD Chief of Staff General [PER Gabi Ashkenazi  ] for the first time . 
[PER Williams  ] reported the GOI did not expect a conflict with [ORG Hizballah  ] in the near future along the [ORG Blue Line  ] . 
He heard repeated worries , however , about the potential for [ORG Hizballah  ] to acquire anti-aircraft missiles or act on its standing threat to retaliate for the death of [PER Imad Mughniyeh  ] . 
[PER Ashkenazi  ] assessed that the early January attack on the convoy of the [MISC Israeli  ] ambassador in [LOC Jordan  ] could have had some limited [ORG Hizballah  ] involvement , but it was uncharacteristically unsophisticated for the group , [PER Williams  ] said . 
[MISC Israeli  ] interlocutors also expressed concerns about extremist [MISC Palestinian  ] groups in [LOC Lebanon  ] , particularly in the [LOC Ain  ] el-Hilweh refugee camp near [LOC Saida.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) For his part , [PER Williams  ] expressed concern to the Ambassador that if another rocket attack were to occur -- whether by [MISC Palestinian  ] militants or [ORG Hizballah  ] -- [LOC Israel  ] would respond forcefully . 
In such an event , [ORG UNIFIL  ] would likely be unable to contain any escalation , he worried , adding , “Everything we’ve worked for could go away in as little 12 hours.” [ORG IDF  ] PRAISE FOR THE [ORG LAF  ] ---------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The [MISC Israeli  ] Defense Forces ( [ORG IDF  ] ) praised the [MISC LAF’s  ] participation in the [MISC Tripartite  ] talks , especially the leadership of [ORG Brigadier General Abdulruhman Shehaitly  ] , [PER Williams  ] said . 
General [PER Heymann  ] had mentioned to [PER Williams  ] , in particular , the late August incident when an ( possibly mentally ill ) [MISC Israeli  ] citizen walked across the [ORG Blue Line  ] and was picked up and returned to [LOC Israel  ] by the [ORG LAF  ] after questioning ( ref B ) . 
In that instance , [PER Heymann  ] asserted to [PER Williams  ] , the credit for the man’s return to [MISC Israeli  ] authorities goes to the [ORG LAF  ] and former [ORG UNIFIL Commander  ] General [PER Graziano  ] . 
UNSCOL ON 1559 -------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) When asked about the December efforts by some to target [ORG UNSCR  ] 1559 , [PER Williams  ] explained that [ORG Security Council  ] resolutions never die or “get canceled , ” as some [MISC Lebanese  ] politicians had advocated . 
[PER Williams  ] noted that many [MISC Lebanese  ] were naive about why [ORG UNSCR  ] 1559 still existed , even though the resolution had not yet been fully implemented . 
While key parts of [ORG UNSCR  ] 1559 , such as Syria’s withdrawal from [LOC Lebanon  ] , had been implemented , [PER Williams  ] said , “the big elephant in the room is [PER Hizballah.” Williams  ] noted that [MISC Lebanese  ] FM [PER Ali Chami  ] had not raised the issue of [ORG UNSCR  ] 1559 recently , despite [MISC Chami’s  ] involvement in lighting December’s media firestorm on the issue ( ref C ) . 
During his latest consultations in [LOC Israel  ] , [PER Williams  ] recalled , no one had raised the issue of [ORG UNSCR  ] 1559 either. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Williams  ] confirmed that the next [ORG UNSCR  ] 1701 report was due at the end of February , with consultations to follow in March , but the next [ORG UNSCR  ] 1559 report was not due until April . 
[PER Williams  ] characterized this timeline as “a better sequence.” He noted that previously , when the [ORG UNSCR  ] 1559 report had come first , it added tensions to the [ORG UNSCR  ] 1701 report and consultations. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) COMMENT: The January 23 incident in [LOC Bint Jbeil  ] is disturbing because of its rapid escalation and the unanswered questions about the role the [ORG LAF  ] played . 
We will underscore the need for strong UNIFIL-LAF cooperation with new [ORG UNIFIL Commander  ] [PER Asarta  ] in a scheduled February 4 meeting and with our [ORG LAF  ] interlocutors at the first opportunity . 
End Comment .
