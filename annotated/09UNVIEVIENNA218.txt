( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG IAEA  ] 's [ORG Safeguards Implementation Report  ] ( [ORG SIR  ] ) for 2008 , an annual report on safeguards worldwide , includes a country-specific section on [LOC Egypt  ] citing for the first time an ongoing investigation of findings in 2007 and 2008 of [ORG HEU  ] and [ORG LEU  ] particles at the [ORG Inshas  ] research center . 
The key sentence reports that although the [ORG Agency "  ] has no indication contrary to [LOC Egypt  ] 's explanations " for the presence of the enriched uranium ( i.e. , the uranium particles came from contamination on imported radioisotope containers ) , the [ORG Agency "  ] has not yet identified the source of the particles " and will continue to investigate according to its " procedures and practices . 
" The Report specifies that additional environmental samples will be required . 
The [ORG SIR  ] section on [LOC Egypt  ] also concludes that earlier issues of undeclared nuclear activities and material reported to the [ORG Board  ] in February 2005 ( GOV/2005/9 ) are no longer outstanding , effectively de-linking the current issue of contamination from the past safeguards problems. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [ORG SIR  ] report refrains from characterizing safeguards implementation in [LOC Egypt  ] as " routine . 
" Rather , for purposes of presentation in the [ORG SIR  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] is placed on similar footing with [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Syria  ] and [ORG DPRK  ] with a country-specific section in the table of contents . 
Including [LOC Egypt  ] in the [ORG SIR  ] report in this manner is a step short of making [LOC Egypt  ] the subject of a country-specific safeguards report as in 2005 , and as has been the case for [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Syria  ] and [ORG DPRK  ] . 
Nevertheless , the optics of being classed in the same category as the others in the [ORG SIR  ] report are not good for [LOC Egypt  ] . 
[LOC Egypt  ] has already begun playing down the report as " old news " by conflating the new [MISC HEU/LEU  ] finding with the 2005 issues . 
We fully expect [LOC Egypt  ] to take this tack in the June [ORG Board  ] meeting which will consider the [ORG SIR  ] report along with country-specific reports on [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Syria  ] . 
Prompted by the [MISC Syrian  ] case , the June [ORG Board  ] will also discuss the issue of " de-restricting " [ORG Board  ] documents , such as the [ORG DG  ] 's reports on safeguards investigations . 
The immediate leak of the restricted draft [ORG SIR  ] will likely be cited by [LOC Egypt  ] as it argues against release of the [ORG DG  ] 's reports , a likelihood foreshadowed by statements already appearing in press from the [MISC Egyptian  ] MFA spokesman . 
As an [ORG IAEA Board  ] member and representative of the [ORG NAM  ] troika , [LOC Egypt  ] is one of the more unhelpful delegations ( next to [LOC Cuba  ] ) on the [ORG Board  ] , particularly on [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Syria  ] issues , and in the [ORG IAEA General Conference  ] ( [ORG GC  ] ) on [LOC Middle East  ] safeguards. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) Recommendation and [ORG Guidance Request: Mission  ] requests any guidance for responding to the [ORG SIR  ] . 
We recommend that our statement to the June [ORG Board  ] supports the strengthened safeguards approach in [LOC Egypt  ] and clearly welcomes and appreciates [LOC Egypt  ] 's full cooperation with those efforts . 
We believe such a [LOC U.S.  ] posture would be the best means for using the [ORG SIR  ] report as a source of leverage against [LOC Egypt  ] to persuade [LOC Cairo  ] to be more cooperative in the [ORG Board  ] and [ORG GC  ] . 
For example , expressing concern about the [ORG HEU  ] finding in [LOC Egypt  ] , or threatening to do so ( as [MISC Israeli  ] Ambassador [PER Michaeli  ] suggested to us ) , in national statements on the [ORG SIR  ] ( which would be reflected in the [ORG Board Chair  ] 's Summary ) could be a point of leverage . 
However , overplaying our hand in this regard could also provoke a defensive reaction from [LOC Cairo  ] , making [LOC Egypt  ] even less cooperative at the [ORG IAEA  ] . 
We recommend a measured , positive approach calibrated to the knowledge ( as the [ORG Secretariat  ] has told us in confidence ) that there is likely a benign explanation for the presence of the uranium contamination , not the tip of a nuclear weapons program iceberg . 
A positive approach , both in [LOC Vienna  ] and [LOC Cairo  ] , taking account of other equities we may have with [LOC Egypt  ] , could be used to build some currency toward a renewed sense of common purpose with [LOC Egypt  ] at the [ORG IAEA  ] . 
End Summary , Comment , and Recommendation. ------------------------------------- [ORG Safeguards Implementation Report  ] 2008 ------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The annual [ORG Safeguards Implementation Report  ] ( [ORG SIR  ] ) for 2008 was issued on May 5 as GOV/2009/24 . 
The [ORG SIR  ] provides a description and analysis of the [ORG Agency  ] 's safeguards operations worldwide in 2008 and summarizes the problems encountered . 
[LOC Egypt  ] received its own section in the report ( see para 13 below for full text ) , along with [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Syria  ] . 
The [ORG SIR  ] addresses two distinct issues on Egypt: 1 ) for the first time informing the [ORG Board  ] of [ORG HEU  ] and [ORG LEU  ] particles found in environmental samples taken at [ORG Inshas Nuclear Center  ] in 2007-2008 ; and 2 ) closing out other outstanding issues related to [LOC Egypt  ] 's past undeclared nuclear activities and materials ( reported to the [ORG Board  ] in February 2005 in GOV/2005/9 ) . 
There is no change to the [ORG Agency  ] 's conclusion that all declared nuclear material in [LOC Egypt  ] remained in peaceful activities for 2008 . 
As [LOC Egypt  ] does not have an Additional Protocol , there is no conclusion on undeclared nuclear material or activities. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) Although this new finding of [ORG HEU  ] and [ORG LEU  ] contamination at [ORG Inshas  ] is established as a distinct issue from the past safeguards problems reported to the [ORG Board  ] in February 2005 , the [ORG Secretariat/Director General  ] reports both issues in tandem in the context of the [ORG SIR  ] document . 
( Comment: Although we suspect access/procedures related to the previous investigation may have contributed to the finding of uranium contamination , [ORG Mission  ] believes the [ORG IAEA  ] reported it as " new " to illustrate [MISC Egyptian  ] cooperation on the earlier issues , therefore making the reporting of the new issue more palatable to [LOC Egypt  ] . 
The optics of the alternative , issuing a special report on [LOC Egypt  ] as is the case with [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Syria  ] and [ORG DPRK  ] would have been far more damaging . 
End comment . 
) ---------------------------------- Reaction to the [ORG IAEA  ] 's [ORG HEU  ] Finding ---------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) According to the [ORG SIR  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] has stated to the [ORG IAEA  ] that it " believed the particles could have been brought into the country through contaminated radioisotope transport containers . 
" The [ORG Agency  ] notes that it will continue its investigation - including taking additional environmental samples - to determine the source of the uranium particles but " has no indications contrary to [LOC Egypt  ] 's explanation . 
" The [ORG Secretariat  ] notably does not characterize this investigation as a " routine , " but instead says it will be investigated in accordance with the [ORG Agency  ] 's " procedures and practices . 
" The [ORG Secretariat  ] 's investigation will be geared toward confirming the origins of the [ORG HEU  ] and [ORG LEU  ] and how they may have ended up in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
[ORG Secretariat  ] contacts have told us ( strictly protect ) they do not so far see any indication that this finding could be the tip of a covert nuclear military or weapons program . 
They see as much more likely possible benign explanations , such as the contamination originating from an old uranium standard or some other very small quantity of uranium that was enriched elsewhere. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG SIR  ] section on [LOC Egypt  ] has already generated negative press for [LOC Egypt  ] , including the fact that the [ORG HEU  ] may have been near weapons-grade . 
Thus far the [MISC Egyptian  ] reaction in [LOC Vienna  ] has been " no comment " ( both the Ambassador and DCM were absent when it came out ) and [LOC Cairo  ] seems inclined to downplay the issue ( incorrectly ) as " old news " by conflating the issue with the 2005 report . 
One press report even speculated that it could have been prompted by [ORG Bechtel  ] losing a contract bid to build a reactor in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
Another press report foreshadowed [LOC Egypt  ] citing the immediate leakage of the " [ORG Board  ] restricted " [ORG SIR  ] draft during the upcoming June [ORG Board  ] discussion of deristriction of [ORG Board  ] documents . 
[LOC Egypt  ] helped prompt the coming June [ORG Board  ] discussion by joining others in resisting release of [PER DG ElBaradei  ] 's reports on [LOC Syria  ] . 
The reaction among other delegations in [LOC Vienna  ] has also been relatively muted . 
The [MISC Australian  ] [ORG Mission  ] assessed that the [ORG SIR  ] did not give rise to proliferation concerns at this stage but that the issue remains open until the [ORG Agency  ] is able to determine the source of the [ORG HEU  ] particles . 
The [MISC Canadian  ] [ORG Mission  ] was still assessing the implications and importance of the report . 
[LOC France  ] also awaits guidance from [LOC Paris.  ] -------------------------------------- Background of Past [LOC Egypt  ] Noncompliance -------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Egypt  ] was cited in the 2004 [ORG SIR  ] report after findings of undeclared material and activities . 
The Director General issued a report to the [ORG Board  ] on February 14 , 2005 with details of the problems that the [ORG Agency  ] had uncovered in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
( Comment: Discovery of the undeclared activity was particularly noteworthy for the fact that the [ORG IAEA  ] launched the investigation on its own after reviewing open source documents that suggested activities not yet declared to the [ORG Agency  ] , i.e. , there was no tip-off from member state intelligence . 
End comment . 
) The undeclared activity related to uranium extraction and conversion , irradiation of uranium targets and reprocessing that had not been reported to the [MISC Agency.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The 2005 [ORG DG  ] report noted [LOC Egypt  ] 's active participation in addressing the [ORG Agency  ] 's outstanding questions , and the Chairman 's conclusion from the March 2005 [ORG Board  ] of Governors meeting supported the [ORG Agency  ] 's investigation and welcomed [LOC Egypt  ] 's cooperation . 
No resolution was passed at the March 2005 [ORG Board  ] on [LOC Egypt  ] 's failure to report nuclear materials and activities ; thus , the [ORG Board  ] made no formal finding of noncompliance and made no report to the [ORG UN Security Council  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] statement at the March 2005 [ORG Board  ] welcomed [LOC Egypt  ] 's cooperation with the [ORG Agency  ] , while also noting the safeguards failures were a matter of concern . 
As noted , the newly released 2008 [ORG SIR  ] closes out these past issues. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG DG  ] concluded in his February 2005 ( GOV/2005/9 ) report that the [ORG Agency  ] identified a number of failures by [LOC Egypt  ] to act in accordance with its obligations under its Safeguards Agreement and that these failures were a matter of concern: -- Failure to report on its initial inventory of imported [PER UF4  ] , imported and domestically produced uranium metal , imported thorium compounds , small quantities of domestically produced [MISC UO2  ] , UO3 , and [PER UF4  ] , and a number of unirradiated low enriched and natural uranium fuel rods ; -- Failure to report the uranyl nitrate and scrap [MISC UO2  ] pellets , and their use for acceptance testing of the [ORG Hydrometallurgy Pilot Plant  ] ; -- Failure to report the irradiation of small amounts of natural uranium and thorium and their subsequent dissolution in the [ORG Nuclear Chemistry Building  ] laboratories , including the production and transfer of waste ; -- Failure to provide initial design information for the [ORG Hydrometallurgy Pilot Plant  ] and the [ORG Radioisotope Production Facility  ] , and modified design information for the two reactors. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) During the March 2005 [ORG Board  ] ( see reftel ) , Members uniformly expressed their satisfaction with [LOC Egypt  ] 's cooperation with the [ORG IAEA  ] and concluded that [LOC Egypt  ] 's failures to declare nuclear material , activities , and facilities in a timely fashion were not a matter of proliferation concern . 
Members justified this conclusion by arguing that some activities were published in open sources and were , therefore , not clandestine ; that some of them occurred 15-40 years ago , even before [LOC Egypt  ] signed the [ORG NPT  ] and concluded a Safeguards agreement ; and that only small amounts of nuclear material were involved . 
[LOC Egypt  ] , at the time , added that any failure to report arose from different interpretations of [LOC Egypt  ] 's Safeguards Agreement. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The 2008 [ORG SIR  ] indicates that between 2004 and 2006 , [LOC Egypt  ] made available to the [ORG Agency  ] nuclear material , submitted design information for three additional facilities , and gave the [ORG Agency access  ] to information , such as logbooks and operating records . 
[LOC Egypt  ] also strengthened the authority of its [ORG Atomic Energy Authority  ] to exercise effective control of all nuclear material and activities in the State . 
As a result of [LOC Egypt  ] 's actions , the [ORG Agency  ] concludes in the 2008 [ORG SIR  ] that it has been able to verify all declared nuclear material in [LOC Egypt  ] and that [LOC Egypt  ] 's statements are consistent with the [ORG Agency  ] 's findings .

( S ) Begin text of [ORG SIR  ] ( GOV/2009/24 ) paragraphs 42-47 dealing with [ORG Egypt: B.1.7  ] . 
[LOC Arab Republic of Egypt  ] <a id='par42' href='#par42'>¶</a>42 . 
Following [ORG Agency  ] enquiries , [LOC Egypt  ] , between 2004 and 2005 , disclosed past undeclared nuclear activities and material to the [ORG Agency  ] , as reported to the [ORG Board  ] in February 2005 ( GOV/2005/9 ) and in the Safeguards Implementation Report for 2005 ( GOV/2006/31 , paragraph 124 ) . 
The results of the [ORG Agency  ] 's investigation since the issuance of these reports , and the [ORG Agency  ] 's current assessment thereof , are described below. <a id='par43' href='#par43'>¶</a>43 . 
Between 2004 and 2006 , [LOC Egypt  ] made available to the [ORG Agency  ] nuclear material that it had failed to report . 
[LOC Egypt  ] characterized and provided information about the material and submitted design information for three additional facilities located at the [ORG Nuclear Research Centre of Inshas  ] ( the [MISC Nuclear Chemistry Building  ] , the [ORG Hydrometallurgy Pilot Plant  ] , and the [ORG Radioisotope Production Facility  ] ) . 
[LOC Egypt  ] also gave the [ORG Agency  ] access to information , such as logbooks and operating records , and access to personnel and locations related to its conversion and irradiation experiments and its preparatory activities related to reprocessing. <a id='par44' href='#par44'>¶</a>44 . 
The [ORG Agency  ] was informed in 2004 by [LOC Egypt  ] 's [ORG SSAC  ] , the [ORG Atomic Energy Authority  ] ( [ORG AEA  ] ) , that it did not have the authority necessary for it to exercise effective control of all nuclear material and activities in the State . 
A Presidential Decree was issued in May 2006 to redefine the [ORG AEA  ] 's authority . 
Ministerial Decrees were issued in October 2006 for the practical implementation of the Presidential Decree . 
The [ORG AEA  ] then undertook a [MISC State-wide  ] investigation of its nuclear material holdings , during which additional , previously unreported , nuclear material was identified , including several depleted uranium items for which [LOC Egypt  ] subsequently provided accounting reports. <a id='par45' href='#par45'>¶</a>45 . 
The [ORG Agency  ] has received relevant nuclear material accounting reports , and has been able to verify all declared nuclear material in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
[LOC Egypt  ] has also clarified issues relating to its past undeclared activities carried out at the laboratories of the [ORG AEA  ] at [LOC Inshas  ] and at the laboratories of the [ORG Nuclear Material Authority  ] at [LOC El Qattamiyah  ] . 
The [ORG Agency  ] has concluded that [LOC Egypt  ] 's statements are consistent with the [ORG Agency  ] 's findings , and that the issues raised in the report to the [ORG Board  ] are no longer outstanding. <a id='par46' href='#par46'>¶</a>46 . 
In 2007 and 2008 , some high enriched uranium ( [ORG HEU  ] ) and low enriched uranium ( [ORG LEU  ] ) particles were found in environmental samples taken at [LOC Inshas  ] . 
[LOC Egypt  ] stated that , as a result of an investigation carried out to identify the source of the particles , it believed the particles could have been brought into the country through contaminated radioisotope transport containers . 
Although the [ORG Agency  ] has no indications contrary to [LOC Egypt  ] 's explanations , it has not yet identified the source of the uranium particles . 
It will continue , in accordance with its procedures and practices , to seek to clarify this issue as part of its ongoing verification activities ; this will include taking additional environmental samples. <a id='par47' href='#par47'>¶</a>47 . 
For 2008 , the [ORG Agency  ] found no indication of the diversion of declared nuclear material in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
Therefore , the [ORG Agency  ] was able to conclude for [LOC Egypt  ] that all declared nuclear material remained in peaceful activities .
