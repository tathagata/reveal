[LOC PARIS  ] POINTS FOR 10/2/2009 [ORG Classified By: Political Minister-Counselor Kathy Allegrone  ] , Reasons 1 . 
4 ( b ) , ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C/NF ) SUMMARY: [MISC French  ] officials , including senior presidency staff , have once again stressed their concern that [LOC U.S.  ] disarmament policy might lead to political pressure on [LOC France  ] to make further cuts to its own nuclear arsenal , pressure [LOC France  ] would resist . 
Nevertheless , the [ORG GOF  ] says it wants to ensure any disagreements with the [LOC United States  ] over disarmament not prevent cooperation towards achieving concrete progress on nonproliferation issues leading up to and at the 2010 [ORG Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty  ] ( [PER NPT  ] ) [ORG Review Conference  ] . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) Elysee ( presidency ) [ORG Strategic Advisor  ] [PER Francois Richier  ] told [ORG Pol M/C  ] on October 1 that [MISC U.S.-French  ] differences on disarmament are " psychological , " and that , while [LOC France  ] supports the [LOC United States  ] reducing its nuclear arsenal , it must not try to impose a " demonization " of nuclear weapons or reduce their role in military strategy . 
Repeating an argument the [MISC French  ] have used before ( ref A ) [PER Richier  ] said the nuclear deterrent is part of [LOC France  ] 's identity , adding that [LOC France  ] 's conventional capabilities are not as strong as those of the [LOC United States  ] . 
While [LOC France  ] welcomes extended deterrence and [ORG NATO  ] guarantees , the [ORG GOF  ] will continue to rely on its own arsenal . 
Therefore , [LOC France  ] would reject any suggestion that it join in multilateral nuclear arms reduction talks ( " if you ask us , we will just say 'No ! 
' " ) . 
According to [PER Richier  ] , this will remain a redline for [LOC France  ] even if the [LOC United States  ] eventually reduces its own arsenal to a size closer to [LOC France  ] 's , since the [ORG GOF  ] bases the size of its deterrent on its evaluation of potential threats , not on the size of another country 's arsenal , especially that of the [LOC U.S.  ] , which is not a security threat to [LOC France  ] in any case. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Richier  ] said [LOC France  ] is , however , looking forward to talking about multilateral disarmament measures other than arms reduction , such as dismantling testing sites or transforming nuclear material to make it suitable for civilian use . 
[LOC France  ] also supports a [ORG Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty  ] ( [ORG FMCT  ] ) , though not one that addresses stockpiles . 
[PER Richier  ] also cautioned about spending too much time creating a comprehensive verification regime for an [ORG FMCT  ] , saying that it would be better to set up a flexible verification system quickly to get a treaty signed without undue delay , since [LOC France  ] 's main strategic goal with an [ORG FMCT  ] is to stop [LOC China  ] from producing fissile materials. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) Earlier the same day , the same message was previewed by MFA NPT officer [PER Celine Jurgensen  ] ( ref B ) , who , along with [PER Richier  ] , will attend upcoming [MISC P3  ] consultations on the margins of the [ORG CSIS  ] conference in [LOC Washington  ] on October <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
[PER Jurgensen  ] said that , despite some disagreements during the negotiation process , [LOC France  ] was quite happy with the resolution adopted at the September 24 [ORG UN Security Council Nuclear Disarmament  ] and [PER Nonproliferation Summit  ] , chaired by President [PER Obama  ] . 
She added that , although [LOC France  ] would have ideally preferred the resolution to mention [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC North Korea  ] by name , the text was an excellent model for a potential product for the 2010 NPT [MISC RevCon  ] . 
[PER Jurgensen  ] also warned against any suggestion that post-START negotiations be broadened to include other nuclear powers , saying [LOC France  ] would simply not disarm further in the foreseeable future . 
She added that she did not think arguments trying to leverage current [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Russian  ] disarmament efforts to gain concessions on nonproliferation from other countries would work . 
Like [PER Richier  ] , however , she added that ongoing [MISC P3  ] consultations were useful and that [LOC France  ] and the [LOC United States  ] clearly shared goals on nonproliferation issues . 
[PER Jurgensen  ] said that [MISC P3  ] consultations should focus on creating an effective outreach strategy focused on both [ORG Non-Aligned Movement  ] states as well as [MISC European  ] nations like [LOC Sweden  ] that might be willing to support watered down nonproliferation language at the 2010 NPT RevCon. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) SUMMARY: The message that [LOC France  ] is not willing to further reduce its nuclear arsenal is not new , though [MISC French  ] officials seem to be making it ever more pointedly . 
There is a clear will to work with the [LOC United States  ] ( and the [LOC UK  ] ) to advance shared nonproliferation goals at the 2010 [PER RevCon  ] and in other fora , but as consultations continue the [ORG GOF  ] seems to be growing more worried about perceived differences in our disarmament policies . 
Clearly laying out our own redlines may either ease [MISC French  ] concerns about the extent of these differences - thus limiting the danger of [MISC French  ] obstructionism - or at least encourage the [MISC French  ] to focus [LOC PARIS  ] 00001355 002 OF 002 less on their fears of calls for arms reductions and more on areas , including on disarmament , where cooperation with its [MISC P3  ] partners may be more fruitful . 
END SUMMARY .
