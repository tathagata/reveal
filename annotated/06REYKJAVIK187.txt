( C ) Summary: An [MISC Icelandic  ] historian 's assertion that the [LOC U.S.  ] would not be shutting down [ORG Naval Air Station Keflavik  ] ( [ORG NASKEF  ] ) had former PM and FM [PER David Oddsson  ] not retired from politics has excited the media and driven the country 's leading politicians into a round of recriminations .

End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Icelandic  ] politicians of every stripe have rushed to respond to the publication this month of an article by historian [PER Valur Ingimundarson  ] in an [MISC Icelandic  ] literary journal . 
[PER Ingimundarson  ] concluded that the personal relationship between President [PER Bush  ] and [LOC Iceland  ] 's [PER David Oddsson  ] ( [ORG Independence Party Prime Minister  ] until 2004 and then Foreign Minister until his resignation from politics in September 2005 ) was responsible for the retention of [LOC U.S.  ] military forces in [LOC Iceland  ] until this year . 
[PER Oddsson  ] 's successors ( [ORG Progressive Party  ] PM [PER Halldor Asgrimsson  ] and [ORG Independence Party  ] FM [ORG Geir Haarde  ] ) lacked the [LOC Washington  ] pull to save [ORG NASKEF  ] , the historian hypothesized . 
[PER Ingimundarson  ] , who interviewed [LOC Washington  ] officials on a December 2005 Voluntary Visitor trip , sourced his story in part to unnamed USG officials. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Key politicians , comments: -- [PER Asgrimsson  ] told the media , " I would find it strange if the [LOC U.S.  ] makes decisions like that . 
If they work like that they wouldn't be very credible in the eyes of other countries.. . 
I have met the [LOC U.S.  ] President a few times , and he has always been friendly to us Icelanders . 
Personal connections always matter in that context , but in the files I have nothing that indicates such a personal commitment.. . 
" -- [ORG Haarde  ] acknowledged that [PER Oddsson  ] 's good relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] had been important but , asked if he were upset that he did not have comparable connections , replied , " I don , t lose sleep over it . 
" Bilateral discussions continue , he added , and the Government 's job now is to deal with what emerges from them . 
-- [PER Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir  ] , chair of the main opposition Alliance , drew attention to the article 's mention ( not previously widely known in [LOC Iceland  ] ) that the [LOC U.S.  ] had informed [PER Oddsson  ] in December 2002 of its decision to withdraw [LOC U.S.  ] fighters from [LOC Iceland  ] , and that the GOI had not gone public with this until after May 2003 elections . 
( In the end , [PER Oddsson  ] persuaded the [LOC White House  ] to reconsider withdrawal of the aircraft , effectively delaying the withdrawal until this year . 
) [PER Gisladottir  ] said that the [MISC Icelandic  ] Government 's support for the invasion of [LOC Iraq  ] could now be seen in a completely new light . 
( Comment: [PER Gisladottir  ] seems to suggest that [PER Oddsson  ] 's support for the [LOC U.S.  ] on [LOC Iraq  ] was not a matter of principle but a bid to reverse the [LOC U.S.  ] decision to withdraw the fighters . 
End comment . 
) -- [PER Gisladottir  ] 's party colleague [PER Ossur Skarphedinsson  ] , [ORG Left Green Party Chair  ] [PER Steingrimur Sigfusson  ] , and [ORG Liberal Party Chair  ] [PER Gudjon Arnar Kristjansson  ] have called for a parliamentary investigation of how the 2002 notification was " covered up " and of how the notification ( may have ) influenced [LOC Iceland  ] 's [LOC Iraq  ] policy. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Ingimundarson  ] told [ORG POLOFF  ] May 26 he was surprised at the uproar , reflecting that the GOI is " of course wounded about ( the closure of [ORG NASKEF  ] ) " and that the media had exaggerated and sensationalized his arguments . 
The tempest , he mused , is symptomatic of politicians , ( and their media friends , ) anxiety about the future of [LOC U.S-Iceland  ] defense ties. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Ingimundarson  ] 's thesis bears a striking resemblance to that put forward to [ORG POLOFF  ] March 17 by [PER Oddsson  ] 's son , [PER Thorsteinn Davidsson  ] , political advisor to Minister of Justice [PER Bjorn Bjarnason  ] ( [ORG Independence Party  ] ) . 
[PER Davidsson  ] , [PER Bjarnason  ] , and others in the [ORG IP  ] 's right wing are furious at the ascendance of the moderate [ORG Haarde  ] as [ORG IP  ] Chairman and likely next Prime Minister . 
They are privately frustrated at the conciliatory tone [ORG Haarde  ] has taken toward the [LOC U.S.  ] since the base drawdown announcement March 15 . 
It is possible they encouraged [PER Ingimundarson  ] ( son of an [PER Oddsson  ] ally ) to burnish their hero [PER Oddsson  ] 's legacy and pressure [ORG Haarde  ] into taking a tougher negotiating stance. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) However the author came to develop his thesis , the public discussion of whether [ORG Haarde  ] " lost the [MISC Americans  ] " will bring pressure on the GOI to adopt a tough stance at upcoming talks on base closure issues and to continue to push the [LOC U.S.  ] for " robust , visible defense arrangements " in the post-NASKEF era .
