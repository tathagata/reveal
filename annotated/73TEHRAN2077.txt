( C ) Summary: The [MISC Dutch  ] parliament on January 18 called off a fact-finding mission to [LOC Afghanistan  ] citing security concerns and time constraints . 
The decision is not expected to have a significant impact on the upcoming debate on [MISC Dutch  ] participation in [ORG ISAF III  ] . 
The opposition [ORG Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) continues to raise questions about the proposed mission , but support for the mission within the party appears to be growing . 
[ORG PvdA Faction  ] Leader [PER Wouter Bos  ] told Charge January 19 that the [ORG PvdA  ] is not yet -- but could be -- convinced to support the mission . 
Parliamentary Trip Canceled ---------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG MFA  ] Deputy Head for [ORG Conflict Prevention  ] [PER Joop Nijssen  ] told Polmiloff January 19 that Parliament opted to cancel the proposed fact-finding trip to [LOC Afghanistan  ] because it would have little added value in the upcoming parliamentary debate . 
[PER Nijssen  ] said the [ORG MFA  ] and [ORG MOD  ] had arranged a whirlwind schedule involving one day in [LOC Kabul  ] and another in [LOC Kandahar  ] , and were prepared to fly interlocutors from [LOC Uruzgan  ] to discuss the security situation . 
[PER Nijssen  ] said several parliamentarians insisted on physically visiting [LOC Uruzgan  ] , to which the [ORG GONL  ] declined due to logistical problems . 
[PER Nijssen  ] acknowledged the [ORG MFA  ] was not particularly upset the trip had been canceled ; security concerns played a key role in turning down the request to visit [LOC Uruzgan.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Parliament hopes to invite experts from [ORG NATO  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] to participate in the January 30 hearing , thereby obviating the need for the trip . 
Moreover , parliamentarians could use the additional time to prepare for the debate , [PER Nijssen  ] said . 
Several parliamentarians -- including [ORG Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) spokesman [ORG Koenders  ] and [ORG CDA  ] spokesman [ORG Ormel  ] -- said during a January 17 dinner that they were not enthused about a trip unless they could visit [LOC Uruzgan  ] , and were confident they could receive the requisite information during the hearing to make an informed decision . 
Support Building in [ORG PvdA  ] ------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Several members of the opposition [ORG Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) have expressed their willingness -- with caveats -- to support the [ORG ISAF III  ] mission . 
In an interview with the left-of-center [LOC Amsterdam  ] daily newspaper Parool on January 18 , [PER Michiel van Hulten  ] ( the newly elected party chairman ) described the [ORG ISAF III  ] deployment as the kind of mission that the [ORG PvdA  ] supports but cautioned that questions remain about whether the significant reconstruction would be achievable given the security situation and the degree of separation between [ORG ISAF  ] and [ORG OEF  ] . 
According to van [PER Hulten  ] , the [ORG PvdA  ] will gladly go if the mission is sound. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In a meeting with [MISC Polcouns  ] on January 18 , [ORG PvdA Defense Spokesman  ] [PER Frans Timmermans  ] assessed that support for the mission within active [ORG PvdA  ] membership currently stood at about 80 percent . 
( Note: This is much higher than we have heard from other sources . 
End note . 
) [PER Timmermans  ] stressed that this support was fragile , and could quickly evaporate if it appeared that the [MISC Dutch  ] would not be able to conduct significant reconstruction work in [LOC Uruzgan  ] and/or if the mission could not be disentangled from [ORG OEF  ] . 
While many in the party , including those in the traditional left , could support the deployment on moral and humanitarian grounds , some also saw the current debate as an opportunity to embarrass and possibly bring down the current government and would argue against the deployment for that reason . 
[PER Timmermans  ] added that [ORG PvdA Parliamentary Faction  ] Leader [PER Wouter Bos  ] had not yet made up his mind on the issue ; once he did , the rest of the party would fall in line. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Charge and [MISC Polcouns  ] met with [PER Wouter Bos  ] and [ORG Koenders  ] on January 19 . 
After hearing Charge 's arguments in favor of the [MISC Dutch  ] deployment , [PER Bos  ] expressed sympathy for the principles of the mission and noted that there was significant support for it within the party . 
The [ORG PvdA  ] , however , would not rush to make a decision until all views had been aired and questions answered . 
[PER Bos  ] described himself as not yet convinced about the mission but did not rule out possible [ORG PvdA  ] support . 
[ORG Koenders  ] also expressed support for the principles of the mission , but reiterated the [ORG PvdA  ] 's concerns about keeping [ORG OEF  ] and [ORG ISAF  ] operations distinct . 
Comment ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG PvdA  ] has played the [ORG Stage III  ] question cautiously , but continues to keep an open mind . 
While the news of their possible receptivity to the mission is encouraging , [ORG PvdA  ] is not yet sold and we still expect an uphill battle in Parliament .
