( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: [PER Jessica Lewis  ] , Senior Foreign Policy Adviser to [ORG Senate  ] Majority Leader [PER Harry Reid  ] and [PER Caroline Tess  ] , Professional [PER Staff Member  ] and Senator [PER Bill Nelson  ] , s designee to the [ORG Senate Select Committee  ] on Intelligence met with [MISC Brazilian  ] government officials from the office of the presidency , [ORG Ministry of Exterior Relations  ] , [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] ( ref a ) , [ORG Ministry of Environment  ] , and the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Senate  ] to discuss [LOC Brazil  ] , s role in the global financial crisis , regional politics , hemispheric energy initiative , and climate change . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] interlocutors expressed support for increased bilateral cooperation on energy , but sent mixed signals on hemispheric cooperation in that area . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] officials also expressed hope that the [LOC United States  ] would begin showing signs of a shift in its policy on [LOC Cuba  ] , and greater understanding of the fundamental changes taking place in [LOC Bolivia  ] , [LOC Ecuador  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] which require a more nuanced [LOC U.S.  ] approach to the region . 
End summary. --------------------------------------- Planalto: [LOC Cuba  ] Should Be [LOC U.S.  ] Priority --------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) During the visit , [PER Staffdel Lewis  ] met with Ambassador [PER Marcel Biato  ] , Assistant to [PER Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] , President [PER Lula  ] , s foreign policy adviser . 
[PER Biato  ] was pleased to note the frequent opportunities the two governments will have over the coming weeks to move the bilateral relationship forward , including Foreign Minister [PER Amorim  ] , s meeting with Secretary [PER Clinton  ] , the upcoming [PER Lula  ] visit to [LOC Washington  ] in March and the [ORG Summit  ] of the [ORG Americas  ] . 
[PER Biato  ] also noted that in a conversation with [MISC Chilean  ] President [PER Bachelet  ] , President [PER Obama  ] had pledged to send a high-level representative to the [ORG Progressive Governance Conference  ] that will take place in [LOC Chile  ] from 27-28 March and will count on the participation of President [PER Lula  ] as well as dozen other world leaders. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Asked about [LOC Brazil  ] , s impressive hosting of four simultaneous summits in [LOC Salvador  ] late last year ( see refs b-d ) , [PER Biato  ] noted that it was part of [LOC Brazil  ] , s effort to form an institutional basis for a formal and more intensive regional agenda that reflects a region that is capable of taking responsibility for its own problems and a re-alignment in terms of the power structure of the region . 
As part of that more intensive agenda , [PER Biato  ] added , [LOC Brazil  ] has made it a priority to include [LOC Cuba  ] in these fora . 
Without [LOC Cuba  ] , [PER Biato  ] observed , " you would have a black hole and not a truly regional approach " . 
Commenting the expectations of the [MISC Brazilian  ] government had for the new [ORG U.S. Administration  ] , [PER Biato  ] noted that [LOC Brazil  ] hoped that President [PER Obama  ] would signal a greater openness on the [LOC Cuba  ] question . 
Any change in approach to [LOC Latin America  ] , [PER Biato  ] added , must include [LOC Cuba  ] as a priority . 
He emphasized that [LOC Cuba  ] is not a monolithic society , even in among the ruling class , and noted that during a visit to [LOC Cuba  ] by President [PER Bachelet  ] to meet with [PER Raul Castro  ] , [PER Fidel Castro  ] made critical comments about [LOC Chile  ] , s relations with [LOC Bolivia  ] , to which [PER Raul Castro  ] had dismiss to [PER Bachelet  ] . 
[PER Biato  ] noted , however , that while the [MISC Brazilian  ] government understood that it would be difficult to expect a major shift in policy before the [ORG Summit  ] of the [ORG Americas  ] , what it was looking for was a gesture or a " sense of momentum " towards an overall change of approach. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Discussing [MISC Brazilian  ] expectations heading into the [ORG Summit  ] of the [ORG Americas  ] , [PER Biato  ] noted that more than specific laundry list of policies , which would imply that the [LOC United States  ] had decided on its own the course its [MISC Latin American  ] policies would follow without first consulting with the region , s leaders , [LOC Brazil  ] hoped for an overall sense of direction . 
For example , on the issue of hemispheric energy cooperation , [PER Biato  ] noted that [LOC Brazil  ] would be open to such a concept , but that it would be surprising if President [PER Obama  ] offered a structured approach , rather than broad themes and goals . 
( Note: [PER Biato  ] , s openness on hemispheric energy [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000282 002 OF 005 cooperation stands in contrast with the more negative reception the idea has received in Itamaraty as reported in ref e and below .

) --------------------------------------- [LOC Brazil  ] will help on [LOC Bolivia  ] , [LOC Venezuela  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Turning to the three most problematic countries from the [LOC U.S.  ] perspective , [LOC Bolivia  ] , [LOC Ecuador  ] , and [LOC Venezuela  ] , [PER Biato  ] noted that the [LOC United States  ] will have to accept a certain level of discomfort as these countries were undergoing fundamental changes that both the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] will have to learn to accommodate . 
He added that both [LOC Brazil  ] and the [LOC United States  ] are in similar situation , in that there is anti-Americanism and a growing anti-Brazilianism in these countries , and that [LOC Brazil  ] , despite suffering graver consequences than the [LOC United States  ] , when these countries undergo periods of instability , has learned to live with it for the sake of stability in the region . 
He noted , as an example , that despite a healthy rainy season providing sufficient hydroelectric power to obviate the necessity to import [MISC Brazilian  ] gas , [LOC Brazil  ] has decided to keep the gas imports going for the sake of providing support and revenue for [LOC Bolivia.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Staffdel members raised the issue of [LOC Bolivia  ] , expressing concern about the [MISC Bolivian  ] Government , s actions on regarding the presence of the [LOC U.S.  ] Ambassador and the [ORG DEA  ] . 
[PER Biato  ] noted that it was a concern for [LOC Brazil  ] as well , and that President [PER Lula  ] will raise these concerns with President [PER Morales  ] and ask for a gesture from the [MISC Bolivian  ] president , adding that it was not in [LOC Brazil  ] , s interest to have [ORG DEA  ] out of [LOC Bolivia  ] , since [LOC Brazil  ] lacked the capability to pick up the slack in that area . 
In a similar vein , [PER Biato  ] added that President [PER Chavez  ] had asked President [PER Lula  ] for help in re-establishing dialogue with the [LOC United States.  ] --------------------------------------------- --------- [PER Itamaraty: Bilateral  ] , Not [MISC Hemispheric  ] , [ORG Energy Cooperation  ] --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Ministry of Exterior Relations  ] , ( [ORG MRE  ] ) Director of the [ORG Department of Energy  ] , [PER Andre  ] do [PER Lago  ] , discussed both international energy policy and climate change . 
With respect to biofuels , he thought that the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] were natural partners , since they are the two largest producers and consumers . 
He said that while some had tried to drive a wedge between the two countries based on the differences between corn and sugarcane based ethanol , the [MISC Brazilians  ] realized that this would be counterproductive . 
Also , he said that both countries had overcome internal concerns over biofuels . 
He would like to see increased efforts on turning biofuels into a global commodity . 
[LOC Brazil  ] had developed a good bilateral energy relationship with the [LOC United States  ] during the [ORG Bush Administration  ] , and do [PER Lago  ] sought to build and expand that relationship . 
8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Brazil  ] was in its early days in developing its oil and gas policy , do [PER Lago  ] commented . 
Until the recent off shore discoveries , the [ORG GOB  ] had not thought of itself in terms of a major oil producer . 
There is concern about the oil " curse " and [LOC Brazil  ] hopes to pursue a " balanced " course , close to what [LOC Norway  ] has done , he added . 
One element is determining what sort of national entity will be responsible for developing the new offshore oil finds . 
Referring to the ongoing deliberations of the intergovernmental ministerial committee , Do [PER Lago  ] predicted that this should be sorted out by the time President [PER Lula  ] goes to the [LOC United States  ] in mid-March . 
( Note: There have been predicted timelines for announcement for a final decision on the oil sector regime , all of which have come and gone as the committee continues to consider alternatives . 
According to sources taking part in the negotiations , there is no clear date for decision making on the horizon . 
End note . 
) Moreover , he added , the energy relationship with the [LOC United States  ] is maturing , as shown by the state-dominated oil company [ORG Petrobras  ] making major investments in the [LOC United States  ] . 
Still , he commented , [LOC Brazil  ] has not yet decided what to do with its new found oil riches . 
There is disagreement over whether to partner with the [LOC United States  ] or [LOC Europe  ] , or possibly with [LOC China  ] or [LOC Japan  ] . 
[LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000282 003 OF 005 ( Note . 
Do [PER Lago  ] reported that earlier in the day [LOC Brazil  ] had signed four agreement with [LOC China  ] on energy , including one calling for [LOC China  ] to invest [MISC US$10  ] billion in developing the offshore finds in return for agreeing to sell a portion of the oil produced to [LOC China  ] . 
Regardless of what type of governmental cooperation may be developed , the [ORG GOB  ] has expressed its continued interest in [LOC U.S.  ] private sector involvement in exploiting its oil reserves , where several [LOC U.S.  ] firms are currently active with [ORG Exxon  ] in a partnership role with [ORG Petrobras  ] in some of the new deep sea blocks . 
End note . 
) <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Do [PER Lago  ] would like to see closer and stronger ties with the [LOC United States  ] in the energy sector . 
He pointed to the 2003 energy Memorandum of Understanding ( [ORG MOU  ] ) as the vehicle for enhanced cooperation . 
At the same time , do [PER Lago  ] voiced skepticism about a hemisphere wide approach , as envisioned in legislation proposed by Senator [PER Lugar  ] last year . 
He explained that with [LOC Venezuela  ] , s [PER Hugo Chavez  ] and his friends there did not seem much chance for proceeding ; though he did not say that [LOC Brazil  ] itself would be obstructing ( nor helping ) such hemisphere-wide efforts . 
Do [PER Lago  ] noted that the [MISC South American  ] regional organization [ORG UNASUL  ] was working on energy , and it expected to launch negotiations of a regional treaty in March . 
He opined that if the [ORG USG  ] pursued a [LOC Western Hemisphere  ] energy agreement that it would fail just as did the [ORG Free Trade Agreement  ] of the [ORG Americas  ] ( [ORG FTAA  ] ) , which was not a happy experience . 
( Note: These comments echo a conversation Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] had with Do [PER Lago  ] , s immediate superior , [PER Andre Amado  ] reported ref d . 
End note . 
) --------------------------------------------- --------- Climate Change and [MISC Copenhagen:  ] The [LOC United States  ] is being set up --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Turning to climate change , Do [PER Lago  ] explained that he was very familiar with the subject , though no longer had direct responsibility within [ORG MRE  ] . 
He stated that [LOC Brazil  ] firmly felt that negotiations should be just under the [ORG UN Framework Convention  ] on Climate Change ( [ORG UNFCCC  ] ) and that discussions elsewhere -- such as at the [MISC G-8  ] and the [MISC Major Economies Meeting  ] -- were distractions and counterproductive . 
He was gloomy about the [ORG UNFCCC  ] conference in December in [LOC Copenhagen  ] , lamenting the overly high expectations . 
There are two things going on he explained: ( 1 ) the members of the [ORG Kyoto Protocol  ] with obligations ( which excludes the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] ) are working out the next round of their commitments ; and ( 2 ) the members of the [ORG UNFCCC  ] will negotiate a set of national targets . 
In the latter case , the [LOC United States  ] , [LOC China  ] , [LOC India  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] should present " interesting national climate change plans " and the [MISC Europeans  ] and other [ORG Kyoto Protocol  ] members will have to take on new targets . 
He warned that the [MISC Europeans  ] really want to get out of [ORG Kyoto Protocol  ] obligations and are setting up the [LOC United States  ] for the blame . 
He said , the [MISC Europeans  ] , [LOC Canada  ] and [LOC Japan  ] are " preparing something very nasty for you in [LOC Copenhagen  ] . 
" They want to see an agreement come out that is unpalatable to the [LOC United States  ] , which would lead to a failure in [LOC Copenhagen  ] and so would excuse them from taking on new obligations under the [ORG Kyoto Protocol  ] . 
Thus , the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] need to work together , he said , to avoid letting the [ORG Kyoto Protocol  ] members off the hook. --------------------------------- [LOC Brazil  ] , s [ORG New Climate Change Plan  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Vice Minister of [ORG Environment Izabella Teixeira  ] described the efforts of the [ORG GOB  ] in addressing climate change in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
She highlighted the new [ORG National Plan  ] on Climate Change , which was promulgated in December , and which covers the full gamut of issues . 
The [ORG Environment Ministry  ] leads the [ORG GOB  ] , s efforts to coordinate efforts that involve not just environmental concerns , but also economic and social ones . 
Implementation of the plan means working with the economic and political actors , such as the [ORG Ministry of Mines and Energy  ] and the [ORG Finance Ministry  ] . 
In fact , the [ORG National Climate Change Plan  ] involves 17 ministries coordinated by the [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000282 004 OF 005 President , s office . 
This plan constitutes a first draft of a roadmap for [LOC Brazil  ] and the focus is not just on deforestation , but also energy generation , energy efficiency , and industrial activity . 
With respect to deforestation , she stressed the importance placed on straightening out the lack of land titles in the [LOC Amazon  ] . 
Further , President [PER Luis Inacio Lula da Silva  ] intended to meet in March or April with the mayors of the 36 municipalities with the highest rates of deforestation to seek a political pact on how to address this problem . 
The [ORG GOB  ] intends to link access to government support , including that from the national [ORG Amazonia Fund  ] , to the municipalities efforts to control deforestation . 
[PER Teixeira  ] stated that today the [ORG Environment Ministry  ] looks at more than just the " [MISC Green Agenda  ] " of biodiversity and conservation , they also deal with " complex economic and political issues surrounding climate change . 
" <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On energy , [PER Teixeira  ] stated that [LOC Brazil  ] wanted to have a cleaner energy matrix , which mean generating more renewable energy , using biofuels , and replacing older , dirtier fossil fuel plants with ones that use cleaner natural gas . 
She said that [LOC Brazil  ] would need to modify its licensing regime for infrastructure projects . 
Also , she wanted to use the [ORG U.S. Minerals Management Service  ] ( MMS ) as a model for auctioning off oil and gas blocks . 
( Note: The revision of the [MISC Brazilian  ] system for the auctioning or contracting of oil and gas blocks is currently under examination by an inter-governmental ministerial committee . 
While [PER Teixeira  ] , s expressed preference is interesting , it does not necessarily represent the view of the deciding committee . 
End note . 
) [PER Teixeira  ] expressed interest in increasing collaborative research with the [LOC United States  ] in the areas of biofuels , other energy sources , and climate change . 
In general , she looked forward to developing a more robust bilateral relationship with the [LOC United States  ] . 
[PER Teixeira  ] was optimistic about the upcoming [MISC Lula-Obama  ] meeting in March . 
She intended to reach out to [MISC Brazilian  ] Senators and Deputies planning to accompany [PER Lula  ] to the [LOC United States  ] on possibilities of greater collaboration. --------------------------------------------- - [MISC Congress: Pleased  ] with Cooperation on Biofuels --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In a meeting with [PER Thalis Murrieta  ] , senior staffer to Senator [PER Joao Tenorio  ] primarily to discuss energy issues , [PER Murrieta  ] shared his interest in seeing both congresses more involved in the bilateral biofuels [ORG MOU  ] . 
He noted that while there was strong interest in [LOC Brazil  ] in seeing the [LOC United States  ] eliminate the ethanol tariff , his senator , s particular view was that it helped ensure a continued [LOC U.S.  ] ethanol demand in the long run by developing a domestic [LOC U.S.  ] market for ethanol . 
He noted his pleasure with the expansion of third country ethanol development assistance . 
In [LOC Murrieta  ] , s assessment , this expansion is a positive step towards biofuels becoming a viable worldwide commodity , recognizing that the [LOC United States  ] and other potential large markets were unlikely to trade dependence on foreign oil for dependence on foreign ethanol . 
[PER Lewis  ] suggested that once administration officials were in place and better able to indicate priorities for energy and the region that [ORG Congress  ] would be in a better position to determine its agenda on these issues . 
She pointed to the [ORG Senate  ] Foreign Relations Committee where Chairman [PER John Kerry  ] has made global climate change a signature issue , as one committee that may have receptivity to working on energy issues with [LOC Brazil.  ] ---------------------------------------- ---- ------ Opposition: Foreign Policy is Government , s Weakness --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In a meeting with Senator [PER Arthur Virgilio  ] , [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Social Democracy Party  ] ( [ORG PSDB  ] ) leader in the [ORG Senate  ] , the senator emphasized the need for [ORG Obama Administration  ] to reverse what he saw as a trend of policy toward the region that has been too distant in recent years , while noting that it would be natural for the economic crisis and pressing matters in the [LOC Middle East  ] to remain top priorities . 
Asked about his views on the current government and what [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000282 005 OF 005 differences would characterize a future [ORG PSDB  ] presidency , Senator [PER Virgilio  ] offered blistering criticism of the direction of the current government , s foreign policy , particularly its overly acquiescent approach to [LOC Bolivia  ] , [LOC Ecuador  ] , and [LOC Venezuela  ] , and what he thought was an overemphasis on the current [MISC South-South  ] approach to foreign relations , to the detriment of [LOC Brazil  ] , s relationships with its traditional partners in the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Europe  ] . 
Regarding [LOC Venezuela  ] , s chances of geting into Mercosul , [PER Virgilio  ] noted that he woulddo everything in his power to keep [LOC Venezuela  ] out but it was only a matter of time before the Senae accepted its entry. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Turning to dometic politics , Senator [PER Virgilio  ] noted that he peronally wished that [LOC Sao Paulo  ] Governor [PER Jose Serr  ] would be the [ORG PSDB  ] , s standard bearer in the 2010presidential elections , but that he hoped that the [ORG SDB  ] would hold some kind of primary in order to etermine the candidate , rather than the party eltes picking him . 
Ultimately , he added , a primary would force both [LOC Serra  ] and [ORG Minas Gerais  ] governor [PER Aecio Neves  ] to travel the country and be forced to visit states like his own , Amazonas , to truly learn of the concerns of the different states , and would ultimately make for a stronger candidacy . 
He added , in reference to possible [ORG Workers Party  ] candidate [PER Dilma Rouseff  ] , that she was a leftist ideologue who would have made a " great minister for [PER Peron  ] " , but lacked the charisma , personal charm , and pragmatism to govern effectively. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 .
