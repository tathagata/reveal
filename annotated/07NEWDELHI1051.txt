( S ) Summary: During the February 28 , 2007 session of the [ORG U.S.-India Counter-Terrorism Joint Working Group  ] ( [ORG CTJWG  ] ) , the [MISC Indian  ] delegation gave a tour d’horizon of developments in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Pakistan  ] , [LOC Sri Lanka  ] , and [LOC Nepal  ] to help set the stage for the day’s discussions ( reported Septel ) . 
[MISC Indian  ] interlocutors presented a bleak assessment of the current situation in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The [ORG Taliban  ] insurgency was gaining strength , according to the [MISC Indians  ] , while the central government in [LOC Kabul  ] remains weak and divided . 
The delegation offered an open , but doubting attitude about whether [LOC Pakistan  ] had made a permanent policy decision to uproot terrorist infrastructure on its territory . 
The [MISC Indians  ] noted , however , that [LOC New Delhi  ] remained committed to working through the [ORG Indo-Pakistani Joint Counterterrorism Mechanism  ] , which holds its first meeting March 6 . 
[MISC Indian  ] officials were concerned about the first hints of [MISC Islamic  ] extremism taking root in [LOC Sri Lanka  ] , and were cautiously optimistic about prospects for the peace process currently unfolding in [LOC Nepal  ] . 
End Summary . 
[ORG Afghanistan: Internal Situation Deteriorating  ] --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) At the request of Ambassador [PER K.C. Singh  ] , head of the [MISC Indian  ] delegation to the [ORG CTJWG  ] , [PER Sharad Kumar  ] , Joint Secretary in the [ORG Cabinet Secretariat  ] , provided India’s assessment of [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Kumar  ] noted he had a rather grim view of the near- and mid-term prospects for stability in the country . 
The death toll was mounting from various insurgency attacks , and both the scale and scope of these attacks were on the rise . 
While there had been some coalition successes in neutralizing the influence of key members of the [PER Talib Shura  ] , the insurgency itself was still moving further into the provinces . 
The [ORG Taliban  ] had now set up seven operational councils within [LOC Afghanistan  ] and were pursuing effective operations in each region . 
Even more worrisome , [PER Kumar  ] stated , was the fact that key [ORG Taliban  ] leaders had recruited a large number of suicide bombers who were now ready for attacks. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) There were also signs of increasing ties between the [ORG Taliban  ] and [ORG Al-Qa’ida  ] elements on both sides of the [MISC Pakistan-Afghanistan  ] border , a fact which is of major significance for stability in both countries . 
From the debriefings of Dr. [PER Mohammed Hanif  ] , a key [ORG Taliban  ] spokesman arrested on January 15 , [PER Kumar  ] stated that “we now know that [PER Mullah Omar  ] is under [MISC Pakistani  ] protection.” [LOC India  ] had also learned that the former chief of [LOC Pakistan’s ISI  ] was directly involved in assistance to the [MISC Taliban.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) Meanwhile , the central government in [LOC Kabul  ] had been largely unable to expand its influence outside of the capital . 
The country , [PER Kumar  ] observed , was falling further into the clutches of tribalism and warlordism . 
President [PER Karzai  ] was in a “feeble” political position ; there was severe bickering within his team and it was unclear that he would be able to implement much through either the tribal jirga or the [MISC Wolesi  ] jirga . 
[PER Karzai  ] was walking a very delicate line , according to [PER Kumar  ] , and not advancing the cause of peace and stability that much. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) In India’s view , [ORG NATO  ] and [ORG ISAF  ] were not on the same wavelength ; their unwillingness to engage in direct combat NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00001051 002.2 OF 005 was the wrong approach for the current situation in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Any agreement with the tribes would provide temporary relief , at best . 
Talks with the various leaders , moreover , were also unlikely to be successful . 
In addition to speaking with more moderate leaders , [ORG NATO  ] and [ORG ISAF  ] were speaking with the hardliners , a fact which sent the wrong message to these leaders about their status and ability to influence the situation in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[LOC India  ] Committed to Assisting the [MISC Afghan  ] Economy , Preventing the Development of a Narco-State ------------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) [LOC India  ] had committed $750 million in assistance to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , the goal of which was to help the country develop an economy that was no longer dependent on drug monies . 
Through efforts such as key road construction projects , [LOC India  ] hoped to help “today’s smugglers become tomorrow’s businessmen.” [MISC Indian  ] interests -- both commercial and official -- had been targeted , even as [LOC New Delhi  ] attempted to assist [LOC Afghanistan  ] with its transition to a more stable economy . 
The road construction crews had been rocketed and bombed ; there had been kidnappings and other personal attacks on [MISC Indians  ] . 
Physical attacks were not the only obstacle , however . 
[PER Kumar  ] stated that [LOC India  ] was hampered in its desire to open up natural and historic trade links with [LOC Afghanistan  ] by the lack of overland transit through [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
If [LOC India  ] could transit humanitarian goods through [LOC Pakistan  ] , savings could be ploughed back into [MISC Afghan  ] development. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) XXXXXXXXXXXX remarked that [LOC India  ] was specifically looking at improving controls on [MISC Indian  ] precursor chemicals as a means to limit and degrade Afghanistan’s opium/heroin production . 
[LOC New Delhi  ] had met with counterparts from [LOC China  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Pakistan  ] and the UAE recently to enhance regional efforts to prevent the diversion of precursor chemicals to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[LOC India  ] was also sharing information directly with [LOC Pakistan  ] , since there was ample evidence that opium and heroin were leaving [LOC Afghanistan  ] and entering [LOC India  ] via [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[LOC Jammu  ] and [LOC Kashmir  ] and the [LOC Punjab  ] were the primary land routes . 
[LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Side Shares Concerns About  ] Afghanistan’s Future , But Less Pessimistic ----------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) XXXXXXXXXXXX stated that the [LOC U.S.  ] shared some of India’s concerns , but did not share in the overall bleak assessment . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] was actively engaged in programs to mitigate the risk of [LOC Afghanistan  ] becoming a narco-state ; America’s own experience in dealing with countries such as [LOC Colombia  ] had given [LOC U.S.  ] policymakers a very clear idea of the problems for regional stability that are associated with a nation falling into this void . 
Deputy Chief of Mission [PER Geoff Pyatt  ] hailed [ORG U.S.-India  ] counternarcotics cooperation as the “gold standard” by which the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC India  ] should seek to emulate in other areas of [LOC CT  ] collaboration . 
Our ability to share sensitive evidence bilaterally , our joint capabilities to conduct surveillance and operations to wrap up narcotics rings demonstrated both nations’ resolve to tackle this issue in the region . 
NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00001051 003.2 OF 005 <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) Continuing with his response , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] added threats from corruption within [LOC Afghanistan  ] as yet another problem to be monitored and fought . 
Drawing on the news that new suicide bombers had been trained and were poised to attack , the [LOC U.S.  ] side also discussed the international dimension of this jihadist activity . 
Extremists could travel to [LOC Afghanistan  ] from many regions -- [LOC North Africa  ] , [LOC Chechnya  ] , [LOC Central Asia  ] -- and receive training in terrorist camps in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Even if/when international partners were finally able to stabilize this country , the terrorists would be able to take their skills and knowledge to a different part of the world , and to a new zone of conflict . 
The capabilities become part of a global terrorist knowledge base. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) XXXXXXXXXXXX outlined some of the successes in the country and noted that the [PER Karzai  ] government had been able to increase stability and return to greater normalcy . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX noted India’s request for land access to [LOC Afghanistan  ] through [LOC Pakistan  ] and said he would relay the request and register it in [LOC Washington  ] . 
[LOC India  ] Open but Cautious about [ORG U.S. CT Cooperation  ] with [LOC Pakistan  ] -------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S ) In a very measured assessment of [LOC Pakistan  ] , Ambassador [PER Singh  ] acknowledged [LOC U.S.  ] reasons for pursuing [LOC CT  ] cooperation with [LOC Pakistan  ] , but stated that [LOC India  ] , itself , maintained a certain skepticism about whether [LOC Islamabad  ] had truly made a sea-change in its approach to this issue . 
[LOC New Delhi  ] had seen evidence of at least tactical decisions to dismantle camps and terrorist infrastructure in [LOC Pakistan  ] , but the [MISC Indians  ] still receive a great deal of intelligence that shows that [LOC Islamabad  ] may not intend to uproot this capability permanently . 
[MISC Pakistani  ] authorities appear to have a desire to keep at least some assets intact in both [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
India’s “nightmare scenario” is that this ad hoc set of actions results in a long-term trend in which terrorist groups are able to find permanent sanctuary in [LOC Afghanistan.  ] “We do not want another century of instability , ” [PER Singh  ] stated. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( S ) The [ORG GOI  ] currently saw a decline in the number of infiltrations across the [LOC Line of Control  ] ( [ORG LOC  ] ) , said [PER Singh  ] , but it was too early to tell whether this was permanent or , indeed , whether this fact mattered that much in terms of overall terrorist infiltration rates into [LOC India  ] . 
[PER Singh  ] outlined three facts that are influencing this short-term trend. --Both sides had stepped up policing activities on the border ; --It was still winter in the border regions ; one could only get a real sense as to infiltration numbers once the spring thaw arrived , and ; -There is a disturbing new trend of terrorist groups using India’s long , unmonitored borders with [LOC Nepal  ] and [LOC Bangladesh  ] to move terrorists into the [MISC Indian  ] heartland . 
Both the [LOC Bangalore  ] and [LOC Hyderabad  ] plots , [PER Singh  ] stated , were masterminded by terrorists who had come across the border with [LOC Bangladesh.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( S ) [LOC India  ] remained open and committed to the [ORG Counterterrorism Joint Mechanism  ] with [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
If dialogue NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00001051 004.2 OF 005 is to succeed , [PER Singh  ] remarked , then [LOC India  ] had to put Pakistan’s willingness to engage to a legitimate test . 
[MISC Indian  ] resolve will come under public scrutiny , of course , since the press is asking -- perhaps rightly -- why it has taken six months for the mechanism to hold its first full-scale meeting , and whether this lag demonstrates that [LOC Islamabad  ] actually has no real desire to see this process succeed. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( S ) The potential worth of the mechanism had already been proven just this month , as both sides were able to insulate the bilateral relationship from a potential downturn after the Samjhuauta train attack by agreeing immediately to discussions of this tragedy in the [ORG Joint Mechanism  ] meeting on March 6 . 
Nevertheless , [PER Singh  ] said , the [MISC Indians  ] had received real push-back from [LOC Islamabad  ] about establishing a regularized schedule for these talks . 
[PER Singh  ] mused that both sides had to accept the fact that extremists would probably try to disrupt any dialogue process -- periodic or permanent -- through attacks timed around the next round . 
That said , it would not be productive for the two sides only to meet if and when there had been some sort of attack. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( S ) For this round , [LOC India  ] will be presenting its evidence on the July 2006 [LOC Mumbai  ] blasts . 
[PER Singh  ] noted it was unclear whether the [MISC Indian  ] interagency process was prepared at this time to put evidence and information about the [LOC Panipat  ] attack before the [MISC Pakistanis  ] . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] , he thought , would probably table concerns about alleged [MISC Indian  ] activities in [LOC Afghanistan  ] which [LOC Islamabad  ] perceived as against its interests . 
The real issue , he said , is to get the dialogue away from the public--and political-- platforms and into a channel in which issues can be thoroughly vetted . 
[LOC Sri Lanka  ] Now More At Risk from [MISC Islamic  ] Jihadist Activity ? ---------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( S ) Turning to [LOC Sri Lanka  ] , Ambassador [PER Singh  ] briefly recounted the historic reasons behind India’s decision to adopt its current cautious position towards the conflict in that country . 
The peace agreement with the [ORG LTTE  ] was more honored in the breach at this juncture ; that said , [LOC New Delhi  ] supported Colombo’s current approach . 
Sudden or direct campaigns that resulted in massive refugee movements or displacement of the population were in nobody’s interest . 
The most worrisome new trend in [LOC Sri Lanka  ] was the onset of some [MISC Islamic  ] jihadist activity . 
The [MISC Indians  ] had fragmentary information at this stage . 
There were open questions about whether [LOC Pakistan  ] had a role in this new development , if only at the tactical level . 
Irrespective of this fact , however , [LOC India  ] still remained concerned . 
If [MISC Islamic  ] extremism were to take hold in [LOC Sri Lanka  ] , yet another port of call in the larger [LOC Indian Ocean  ] region could become a threat to [LOC India  ] . 
[MISC Nepal: Next Few Months  ] are Crucial to Creating Stability ----------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( S ) The [MISC Indian  ] side closed its presentation with a brief overview of the peace process in [LOC Nepal  ] . 
Ambassador [PER Singh  ] reviewed the [MISC Indian  ] calculus that had led [LOC New Delhi  ] to support the current peace process . 
It was important , he stated , for the [MISC Nepalese  ] army to remain engaged and not to become demoralized . 
The [ORG UN  ] would play a useful role in providing civilian policing and in overseeing the NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00001051 005.2 OF 005 demilitarization of the [MISC Maoists  ] . 
The key thing to ensure success was to shorten the transition period between the current situation and the election of the constituent assembly . 
With the onset shortly of the monsoon season , and the [LOC Dussehra  ] festivities this fall , there was actually only a short window of opportunity to move the process along. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( S ) Finding the right tools for border management was a key issue for [LOC India  ] at this stage . 
[PER Singh  ] noted the “mushrooming” of the number of madrassas in the [LOC Terai  ] belt and underscored [MISC India’s  ] concern that this region -- which forms an open and essentially unmonitored border with [LOC India  ] -- become stable and peaceful . 
[LOC New Delhi  ] was placing great emphasis on creating both rail and road links as a way to open up and stabilize the economy in the region. “We cannot fence the border , ” [PER Singh  ] observed , “so we need successful communities on both sides of the border as the best preventative measure” to ward off any further radicalization of the population . 
[PER Singh  ] presented this as a new [MISC Indian  ] strategy for combating terrorism along [MISC India’s  ] borders . 
Softening the border actually contributes to [MISC India’s  ] ability to prevent terrorism , he explained , because a happier local population is less likely to allow terrorists the safe haven and support necessary for their activity . 
( Comment: [PER Singh  ] seemed to be implying that this was part of [MISC India’s  ] broader strategy against terrorism in other border states , including [LOC Kashmir  ] and [LOC Bangladesh  ] .
