( C ) Although she has not publicly stated her intentions , it is clear that [ORG First Lady Sandra Torres  ] de [PER Colom  ] intends to run for the [MISC Guatemalan  ] Presidency in 2011 . 
[PER Torres  ] , who is to the left of her husband , President [PER Alvaro Colom  ] , is a controversial figure . 
She is the most able manager in the government , and also the most abrasive . 
Many poor , rural [MISC Guatemalans  ] , ignored by previous governments , are grateful for her [ORG Conditional Cash Transfer  ] and other social programs . 
Many middle- and upper-class urban voters tend to see [PER Torres  ] as a radical populist . 
Her sex and middle class provincial origins reinforce the upper class' distrust of her . 
The [MISC Guatemalan  ] Constitution bars presidential family members from running , but [PER Torres  ] is likely to challenge that obstacle . 
Her efforts to do so would generate considerable controversy , given the politicization and corruption in judicial institutions . 
The [ORG First Lady  ] 's likely candidacy means that the current [ORG GOG  ] is balancing governance with preparing for the 2011 campaign . 
End Summary . 
[ORG First Lady Preparing  ] for 2011 Election --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Although she has not publicly declared her intention , several Embassy contacts have reported that [ORG First Lady Sandra Torres  ] de [PER Colom  ] has confided to them that she is preparing to run for President in 2011 . 
The press regularly comments on her presidential aspirations , which [LOC Guatemala  ] 's [ORG First Family  ] has neither discouraged nor denied . 
When inaugurated in 2008 , President [PER Colom  ] publicly declared that his wife would be a [ORG First Lady  ] " like no other , " and indeed her policy activism and role in managing the government are without local precedent . 
[PER Colom  ] has also told the Ambassador that [LOC Guatemala  ] 's deep-rooted poverty , violence , and impunity could be resolved by the continuity of having the same party in power for two to three presidential terms . 
An Effective Manager... ------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) With the [MISC Guatemalan  ] economy buffeted by the global downturn and security continuing to deteriorate , President [PER Colom  ] regularly points to his wife 's social programs as his government 's principal achievements . 
[PER Torres  ] de [PER Colom  ] leads the [ORG GOG  ] 's Social [ORG Cohesion Council  ] , an inter-ministerial coordinating mechanism for the [ORG GOG  ] 's social welfare programs . 
The [ORG Council  ] 's activities constitute a ground-breaking official effort to alleviate poverty and attack its worst manifestations , including widespread child malnutrition . 
Although the recent increase in child malnutrition cases related to drought challenges some of Social Cohesion 's effectiveness , we believe the [ORG First Lady  ] is by far the best senior manager in government ( albeit not a transparent one ) : She is smart , hard-working , and demands results . 
At the same time , her abrasiveness has lost her some allies , and we suspect that her subordinates are reluctant to give her or the public bad news. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Torres  ] de [PER Colom  ] is best known to the public for the [ORG Council  ] 's flagship [ORG Conditional Cash Transfer  ] ( [ORG CCT  ] ) Program , " [MISC My Family  ] Progresses " ( ref a ) . 
Like CCTs in [LOC Mexico  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] , and elsewhere , " [MISC My Family  ] Progresses " provides monthly cash stipends to poor mothers on the condition that they keep their children in school and vaccinated . 
According to official statistics , the [MISC Guatemalan  ] [ORG CCT  ] reached 280,000 families in 89 municipalities in 2008 . 
In 2009 , the [ORG GOG  ] plans to expand it to reach 500,000 families ( approximately one-fifth of the country 's population ) in 140 municipalities . 
President [PER Colom  ] indicated that the annual budget for " [MISC My Family  ] Progresses , " which began at approximately $19 million , could reach $260 million in 2 <a id='par010' href='#par010'>¶</a>010 . 
This dramatic expansion so far has been funded largely by transfers from other government programs , including the [ORG Ministries of Health , Education  ] , and [ORG Government.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Critics point out that the [MISC Guatemalan  ] [ORG CCT  ] omits transparency and accountability controls found in other such programs in [LOC Latin America  ] . 
The [ORG GOG  ] has refused congressional requests to disclose the names and addresses of program recipients on privacy grounds despite a January 2009 [ORG Constitutional Court  ] decision ordering it to do so . 
Critics charge -- without proof -- that the refusal is cover to facilitate continuing theft of program resources . 
Business sector and other critics have accused the [ORG GOG  ] of fomenting a culture of dependency via the [ORG CCT  ] , and of using it to buy the [ORG First Lady  ] a political support base for her presidential aspirations. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) There is some element of sexism and classism in the upper and middle classes' opposition to [PER Torres  ] . 
[LOC Guatemala  ] is a conservative society , and the large , indigenous society to which [PER Torres  ] is appealing for support through her social programs is very male-centered . 
[PER Torres  ] is nonetheless making headway . 
Two days after listening to [LOC Guatemala City Mayor  ] [PER Alvaro Azul  ] say that , " [LOC Guatemala  ] will never elect a female president , " the Ambassador visited a remote village in [LOC Quetzaltenango  ] department ; the auxiliary ( unpaid , indigenous ) mayor was glowing in his appreciation for [PER Torres  ] , who had recently listened to the town 's request for a bridge and had just approved it for bid submission . 
In the subsequent ceremony there for the President and [ORG First Lady  ] , there were as many cheers for her as for him. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) " [MISC My Family  ] Progresses " is not the [ORG First Lady  ] 's only program that has become popular with the poor . 
Other Social [ORG Cohesion Council  ] programs include the [ORG Solidarity Bags Program  ] ( food assistance for poor urban families ) , the [ORG Open Schools Program  ] ( which provides children in gang-infested neighborhoods a safe place to play and learn on the weekends ) , and the [ORG Solidarity Din ing Program  ] ( subsidized cafeteria meals ) . 
According to Social [ORG Cohesion Council  ] data , 26,500 families benefited from the [ORG Food Assistance Program  ] , 125,000 children participated in the [ORG Open Schools Program  ] , and over 1 million meals were served as part of the [ORG Subsidized Meals Program  ] from June 2008 to June 2009 . 
According to Social [ORG Cohesion Council  ] figures released in August , the budget for the three programs from June 2008 to June 2009 amounted to approximately $17.5 million. .. . 
But an Abrasive Personality -------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Sandra Torres  ] de [PER Colom  ] 's assertive personality does not sit well with everyone in male-dominated [MISC Guatemalan  ] society . 
According to President [PER Colom  ] 's ousted campaign manager , [PER Jose Carlos Marroquin  ] , [PER Torres  ] de [PER Colom  ] wrested from him control of [PER Colom  ] 's 2007 presidential campaign . 
Following [PER Colom  ] 's inauguration , the [ORG First Lady  ] screened potential cabinet officers , and continues to query and chastise cabinet officers during her regular participation in cabinet meetings . 
Several former cabinet officers and cabinet candidates who declined positions privately cited her abrasive treatment as the reason they left government or did not join it in the first place. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Torres  ] de [PER Colom  ] is widely suspected to have been behind the ouster of presidential security director [PER Carlos Quintanilla  ] ( ref b ) , and influential Congressman [PER Manuel Baldizon  ] told Pol/Econ Counselor he and ten other members left the governing [ORG UNE  ] 's congressional bench over [ORG Torres'  ] " dictatorial " direction of the [ORG UNE  ] bench ( ref c ) . 
According to [ORG UNE  ] Deputy [PER Christian Boussinot  ] , [ORG Torres'  ] insistence on taking the governing party further to the left is already dividing it , and led [ORG UNE  ] President of [ORG Congress  ] [PER Roberto Alejos  ] to publicly muse about leaving the party . 
[ORG Torres'  ] inner circle of former guerrillas such as Peace Commissioner [PER Orlando Blanco  ] and [ORG Presidential Advisor Jorge Ismael Soto Garcia  ] ( aka " [PER Pablo Monsanto  ] , " who was implicated in planning the 1968 murder of [LOC U.S.  ] Ambassador [PER John Gordon Mein  ] ) , as well as her close relationship with [MISC Cuban  ] Ambassador [PER Omar Morales  ] ( per [MISC XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , STRICTLY PROTECT ) , stir anxieties on the right end of the political spectrum . 
( Note: Conservative Presidents [PER Arzu  ] and [PER Berger  ] also had ex-guerrilla advisers . 
) [PER Torres Likely  ] to [ORG Clear Constitutional Hurdle  ] --------------------------------------------- ------------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG Article  ] 186 of the Constitution prohibits the president 's relatives " within four degrees of consanguinity and second-degree in-laws " from running for president . 
[ORG Torres'  ] supporters argue that , because she is neither a blood relative nor an in-law of the President , she is eligible to run . 
Opponents counter that [LOC Guatemala  ] 's [ORG Civil Code  ] defines spouses as relatives and in-laws . 
In 1989 , the [ORG Constitutional Court  ] banned then-First [PER Lady Raquel Blandon de Cerezo  ] from running for president , concluding that the prohibition against second degree in-laws " includes the spouse . 
" <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Nonetheless , several elements work in [ORG Torres'  ] favor . 
A new [ORG Constitutional Court  ] likely to be sympathetic to the governing [ORG UNE  ] party will be seated in April 2011 , just in time to rule on [ORG Torres'  ] candidacy . 
Furthermore , it is not clear that the President and [ORG First Lady  ] are legally married . 
On February 24 , 2002 , [PER Colom  ] announced his marriage to [PER Sandra Torres  ] at the [ORG UNE National Assembly  ] which launched him as a presidential candidate in 2003 . 
[PER Colom  ] stated that they had married in [LOC Cuba  ] on " the previous Saturday " ( either February 16 or 23 ) . 
According to newspaper " [ORG El Periodico  ] , " [PER Sandra Torres  ] was legally divorced from [PER Augusto  ] de [PER Leon  ] ( see biographic note below ) in December 2002 -- ten months after the [ORG First Couple  ] married in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
Finally , [PER Colom  ] later described the wedding as a " [MISC Mayan  ] ceremony . 
" Under [MISC Guatemalan  ] law , ceremonial weddings have the same validity as common law marriages , which can be legally dissolved by either party " walking out . 
" The Evolving [ORG Electoral Landscape  ] ------------------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) At this early stage , it appears that the two principal presidential contenders in November 2011 will be rightist General [PER Otto Perez Molina  ] of the opposition [ORG Patriot Party  ] and [PER Sandra Torres  ] de [PER Colom  ] . 
Taking a page from her husband 's successful campaign , [ORG Torres'  ] strategy would be to win with the support of rural , poor voters , many of whom are benefiting from her social programs . 
[ORG Electoral  ] reforms in 2007 that nearly doubled the number of rural polling stations , making it easier for rural citizens to vote , benefited [PER Alvaro Colom  ] and presumably would also benefit [ORG Torres.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Recent presidential elections have tended to favor the previous runner-up . 
[PER Perez Molina  ] finished second to [PER Colom  ] in 2007 . 
A poll of unknown reliability published in August in newspaper " [ORG El Periodico  ] " indicated [PER Perez  ] is the current front-runner , with the support of 34% of likely voters . 
According to the poll , almost none of the respondents indicated [PER Torres  ] de [PER Colom  ] as their first choice , but one [PER Perez  ] election advisor privately said he estimates her current support at about 12% . 
An economic advisor to [PER Torres  ] told [ORG Emboffs  ] that [PER Torres  ] is aware that she is a polarizing figure , and that if her poll numbers do not quickly improve as the election approaches , she might resign herself to being the power behind the throne , and let someone else run in her stead . 
He said that so far there is no consensus on who that might be , or whom [PER Torres  ] might pick as her running mate. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) The extent to which the [ORG MDF  ] congressional finance scandal will sully [PER Perez Molina  ] is not yet clear , but it is something he will have to confront in the course of the campaign ( ref d ) . 
Evangelical pastor [PER Harold Caballeros  ] of the [ORG VIVA Party  ] plans to challenge [PER Perez Molina  ] for right-leaning voters' support , while center-left populist congressman [PER Manuel Baldizon  ] may challenge [PER Torres  ] for center-left votes . 
Many observers think , however , that 2011 is likely to be a trial run for [PER Caballeros  ] and [PER Baldizon  ] , and that they will become potential finalists for the presidency only further down the road. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) ( Biographic Note: [PER Sandra Julieta Torres Casanova de Colom  ] was born Oct. 15 , 1959 , in [PER Melchor de Mencos  ] , [ORG Peten Department  ] , [LOC Guatemala  ] , on the border with [LOC Belize  ] . 
She studied high school in [LOC Belize  ] , got an undergraduate degree in communications from [ORG San Carlos University  ] , and received a Master 's Degree in Public Policy from [ORG Rafael Landivar University  ] . 
She owns several textiles factories . 
[ORG Torres'  ] family is influential in politics . 
Her first husband , [PER Edgar Augusto de Leon  ] , was leader of the leftist and now defunct [ORG DIA  ] party , which unsuccessfully ran [PER Alvaro Colom  ] for president in 1999 . 
She has four children by de [PER Leon  ] . 
[ORG DIA  ] ran [ORG Torres'  ] older brother , [PER Luis Rolando Torres Casanova  ] , for president in 1995 , also unsuccessfully . 
Her mother , [PER Teresa Casanova  ] , served as mayor of [LOC Melchor de Mencos  ] . 
Her sister , [PER Gloria Torres  ] , serves as the [ORG Presidential Liaison to Guatemala  ] 's municipal governments . 
End Note . 
) Comment ------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) Much will change between now and Fall 2011 , but different parties' plans for that distant event are already taking shape and impacting the political landscape . 
[LOC Guatemala  ] 's current electorate is distinct from that of many [MISC Latin American  ] countries in that it ranges from center-left to hard-right . 
However , widespread poverty , hunger , marginalization of the large ( but fractious ) indigenous minority , and a long history of state neglect of the poor could prove fertile ground for the rise of a new , more radical left . 
[PER Torres  ] de [PER Colom  ] is working quickly to build just such a base for her presidential bid .
