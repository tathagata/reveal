( U ) [MISC Summary: Despite  ] a weekend of frantic efforts by the leaders of [LOC Iceland  ] 's governing coalition to bring their parties to heel , Prime Minister [PER Haarde  ] announced January 26 that the governing coalition has fallen apart less than two years into its term . 
The immediate cause was the demand of the junior party , the [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] , that the [PER Haarde  ] 's [ORG Independence Party  ] ( [ORG IP  ] ) yield the Prime Minister 's seat and make other concessions . 
While [PER Haarde  ] wants to establish a unity government with the [ORG IP  ] at the head , there is considerable doubt that he will be successful . 
President [PER Grimsson  ] will meet with the heads of all the parties prior to giving one the mandate to form a coalition . 
Many expect the [ORG SDA  ] to be tapped . 
Early parliamentary elections are expected . 
End Summary . 
A Last-Ditch Effort Fails ------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) After Prime Minister [PER Geir Haarde  ] 's dramatic announcement on January 23 that he has been diagnosed with cancer and that his [ORG Independence Party  ] would call for early elections in May ( ref D ) , the stage was set for a weekend of furious negotiation between the heads of the governing coalition . 
[PER Haarde  ] held several meetings over the course of the weekend with [ORG Social Democratic Alliance Chair  ] and Foreign Minister [PER Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir  ] to discuss the future of the government . 
Adding to the drama , on January 25 Minister of Commerce [PER Bjorgvin Sigurdsson  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) announced his resignation as well as that of the entire board of the [ORG Financial Supervisory Authority  ] ( [ORG FME  ] ) . 
[PER Sigurdsson  ] said he hoped to take some responsibility for the banking collapse , while also pointedly suggesting that the Board of the [ORG Central Bank  ] should consider doing the same. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On January 26 , the [ORG IP  ] and [ORG SDA  ] chairs met with their respective parliamentary caucuses to brief on the weekend 's negotiations . 
The rumored outlines of the [ORG SDA  ] 's offer: in order to keep the coalition alive , the [ORG IP  ] needed to fire [ORG Central Bank  ] Chairman [PER David Oddsson  ] and the rest of the Board ; agree to spring elections ; and yield the [ORG Prime Ministry  ] to an [ORG SDA  ] designee . 
By most accounts , the third point was a bridge too far: the [ORG Political Advisor  ] to the Minister of Finance ( [ORG IP  ] ) told [PER PolOff  ] that his boss went into today 's meeting willing to yield on the other requests , but that the [ORG IP  ] would rather walk than surrender the Prime Minister 's seat to its junior partner. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) Just after midday , PM [PER Haarde  ] announced to waiting press that the [ORG Independence Party  ] had been unable to agree to the [ORG SDA  ] 's demands , and that the coalition would dissolve . 
While thanking [ORG SDA Chair  ] Gisladottir for her warm and honorable collaboration over the last two years , [PER Haarde  ] had harsh words for the [ORG SDA  ] and its " lack of courage " to press forward with the coalition . 
He added that the [ORG SDA  ] demand for the [ORG Prime Ministry  ] was a nonstarter and that it should have been obvious to the [ORG SDA  ] that this would never be accepted . 
Referring to the urgent work awaiting the government as it implements the [ORG International Monetary Fund  ] 's recovery program ( ref C ) , [PER Haarde  ] said he hoped to assemble a unity government under [ORG IP  ] leadership. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) [PER Haarde  ] met with [MISC Icelandic  ] President [PER Olafur Ragnar Grimsson  ] at day 's end to formally relinquish his mandate to form a government . 
[PER Grimsson  ] will now meet with the heads of the country 's other political parties , after which he will give one party the mandate to assemble a coalition . 
Many expect that he will choose [PER Gisladottir  ] 's [ORG SDA  ] , given [PER Grimsson  ] 's previous political career in one of the parties that combined to form the [ORG SDA  ] . 
What government next ? --------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Iceland  ] will without a doubt see parliamentary elections in the coming months , two years ahead of schedule . 
The opposition parties , surging in polls as a result of popular displeasure with the government , will want to lock in their gains at the ballot box , and the outgoing government parties will want a chance to present a new face to the public . 
However , in the interim a caretaker government will most likely be established , and two possibilities are getting the most discussion: a unity government with all five parties in the [ORG Althingi  ] , and a leftist minority government with the [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000020 002 OF 002 pledged support of the [ORG Progressive Party.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On first reading , a unity government seems more likely , given that all parties have now stated their desire for one . 
However , such an agreement may be unattainable due to severe policy conflicts between the [ORG IP  ] and the [MISC Left-Greens  ] . 
The [MISC Left-Greens  ] ( and others ) would be likely to object to a unity government under [ORG IP  ] leadership , given the current discontent with the government . 
Beyond that , however , the [ORG Deputy Chair  ] of the [ORG Left Green Movement  ] told [PER PolOff  ] just before the government fell that the [MISC Greens  ] would not come into government " just to be there . 
We have policy concerns that we want to see addressed , " such as renegotiation or outright cancellation of the [ORG IMF  ] loan and changes to the tax structure for corporations and individuals . 
[ORG IP  ] stalwarts such as a leading investment banker have told EconOff that these moves are exactly what the [ORG IP  ] -- and the broader business community -- fear . 
Such basic conflicts may make it impossible for the [ORG IP  ] and the [MISC Left-Greens  ] to be in the same government , even a caretaker unity government. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) A minority coalition between the [MISC Left-Greens  ] and the [ORG SDA  ] would also pose problems . 
Though the new [ORG Progressive Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) chair has pledged to support such a minority coalition , the three parties disagree on a number of issues ( such as [ORG EU  ] membership ) . 
The [ORG SDA  ] has also been a strong backer of the [ORG IMF  ] bailout plan , which could hinder SDA-LG cooperation just as it would a unity government. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) COMMENT: Despite the unclear political situation and limited options for a new coalition , all parties agree that there is little room for delay . 
The [MISC Left-Greens  ] want elections earlier than all other parties , but all want to vote sooner than later . 
We expect that a caretaker coalition , if there is to be one , will be announced in the next few days , and will carry with it a date for spring elections . 
Failing that , we expect President [PER Grimsson  ] to announce the [ORG Althingi  ] 's dissolution and elections to follow within 45 days , as specified by the constitution .
