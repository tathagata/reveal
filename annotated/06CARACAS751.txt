( C ) President [PER Hugo Chavez  ] currently faces the conundrum of whether he can maintain a leadership style of exploiting resentment among [LOC Venezuela  ] 's poor while extolling the benefits of a seven-year revolution , according to anti-Chavez psychiatrist [PER Roberto de Vries  ] . 
[PER De Vries  ] describes [MISC Venezuelans'  ] emotional states as two minority extremes -- revenge for [PER Chavistas  ] and desperation for the opposition -- that ride herd on a disappointed and depressed majority . 
[PER Chavez  ] easily drives the [MISC Venezuelan  ] political and social scene with his messianic tendencies and mastery of emotional manipulation . 
Despite this , [PER de Vries  ] believes [PER Chavez'  ] charisma is starting to wane , both for lack of a genuine opponent and growing expectations among his traditional constituency . 
We present this as one person 's analysis of developments in [LOC Venezuela  ] , though [PER de Vries  ] is clearly tailoring his psycho-political theories for desperate opposition audiences . 
Post has noticed , however , that [PER Chavez  ] has seemed off his game of late , appearing more irritable and explosive . 
End summary. ------------------------------------ The [ORG Psycho-Social State of Venezuela  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Dr. [PER Roberto de Vries  ] is a psychiatrist and public commentator who has written extensively on the psychological aspects of [MISC Venezuelan  ] life , including politics . 
He told [ORG Poloff March  ] 3 that , prior to the rise of [MISC Bolivarianism  ] , [MISC Venezuelans  ] were , in psychological terms , " happy " to the point that they ignored the decaying social environment around them . 
Candidate [PER Hugo Chavez  ] was able , however , to whip up latent resentment and frustration among the poor to achieve a remarkable electoral victory . 
After seven years of political turmoil , he said , society is fragmented with radical minorities ( about 10 percent each ) occupying the extremes of the political spectrum dominating the debate . 
The pro-Chavez extremists he describes as having " happiness in anger , " or revenge , those who enjoy watching [PER Chavez  ] stick it to the former ruling class . 
On the opposition side , [PER de Vries  ] said , are those who experience " sadness with fear , " which translates to desperation and often leads to politically imprudent actions . 
This is why [PER Chavez  ] routinely takes actions that heighten their fears , such as threatening to prosecute various members of the opposition. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The majority of [MISC Venezuelans  ] , [PER de Vries  ] said , experience " sadness with anger . 
" These people feel disappointment , whether in the failed promise of [PER Chavez  ] to deliver or for opposition leaders to find a way to rid [LOC Venezuela  ] of [PER Chavez  ] . 
This explains , he argued , why most [MISC Venezuelans  ] seem to have no reaction to often outrageous statements and actions by both sides in the political fight . 
This behavior leads to depression and , in the case of individuals , could suggest suicidal tendencies . 
In the case of a large population , [PER de Vries  ] said , it could cause instability and unexpected outbreaks of violence. ------------------------------- [MISC Chavez: All Things For All Men  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER De Vries  ] described " image of power " that he emits to the public . 
( [PER Note: Obviously  ] , [PER de Vries  ] has never examined [PER Chavez  ] directly , which limits his analysis to secondhand accounts . 
) [PER Chavez'  ] physical appearance , the " first impression , " allows him to relate simultaneously to white , indigenous , and [MISC African Venezuelans  ] . 
His style of speech is [LOC CARACAS  ] 00000751 002.2 OF 003 hard and fast , which [PER de Vries  ] said comes from [LOC Chavez'  ] desire to be perceived as an ardent revolutionary . 
[PER Chavez  ] likes being seen as a " victimario , " loosely translated as the one who exacts revenge on behalf of others , like an executioner. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER De Vries  ] emphasized [PER Chavez'  ] " emotional intelligence " as his greatest strength -- and weakness . 
[PER Chavez  ] can instinctively read and manipulate the emotions of individuals and groups . 
[PER Chavez  ] , [PER de Vries  ] said , can also make people feel like they are in the majority or the minority , as appropriate , which affects their self-perception . 
( [PER De Vries  ] noted the irony that [PER Chavez  ] is actually speaking from the elite minority of a new ruling class when he pitches his message to the poor masses . 
) The catch is that [PER Chavez  ] lacks maturity and often cannot control his own emotions , which explains his tendency to spout off the moment he feels his authority challenged . 
[PER De Vries  ] said [PER Chavez  ] will even become depressed himself if his emotions get the best of him , like when his own constituency rejects his more outlandish statements. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Ideologically , [PER Chavez  ] wants to project an image of a " utopian socialist , " which [PER de Vries  ] described as someone who is revolutionary , collectivist , and dogmatic . 
In reality , [PER de Vries  ] argues , [PER Chavez  ] is an absolute pragmatist when it comes to maintaining power , which makes him a conservative . 
Coupled with [PER Chavez'  ] self-love ( narcissism ) , sense of destiny , and obsession with [MISC Venezuelan  ] symbolism , this pragmatism makes [PER Chavez  ] look more like fascist , however , rather than a socialist . 
[PER Morally  ] , [PER Chavez  ] combines a sense of tragedy and romanticism ( a desire for an idyllic world ) to project a messianic image . 
[PER De Vries  ] , however , said [PER Chavez  ] is a realist who uses morals and ethics to fit the situation. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER De Vries  ] said that [PER Chavez  ] has two principal fears: rejection and anonymity . 
His fear of rejection comes , said [PER de Vries  ] , from [LOC Chavez'  ] early childhood in which he was reportedly rejected by his father ( and with whom he is reportedly not close today ) . 
[PER Chavez  ] also suffered humiliation and rejection as a child from degrading jobs like having to sell candy on the street . 
His related fear of anonymity is a fear that he will prove to be irrelevant to history . 
[PER De Vries  ] said this explains why [PER Chavez  ] has established a leadership structure in which he is the final decisionmaker , and even micro-manager. ----------------- Falling Charisma ? ----------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER De Vries  ] argued that [PER Chavez'  ] domination of the [MISC Venezuelan  ] state is making it more difficult to use resentment and revenge to motivate core supporters . 
[MISC Poor Venezuelans  ] , [PER de Vries  ] claimed , are not seeing the results of [LOC Chavez'  ] promised revolution and are starting to slip into the " disappointed " majority , where loyalty is gained with deliverables . 
But [PER Chavez  ] cannot satisfy their needs , [PER de Vries  ] contended , because it would require him to act as a conciliator and governor , taking him away from the revolutionary image from which he draws strength . 
[PER De Vries  ] said this contradiction , made manifest by the meager voter turnout in last December 's legislative elections , is taking its toll on [PER Chavez  ] . 
He opined that [PER Chavez  ] has limited his public appearances since December and has lashed out publicly against criticism from his own supporters. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER De Vries  ] caters his analysis to the opposition crowd , a fact which should be taken into account in assessing his observations . 
But we have noticed of late some new irritability in [PER Chavez  ] , including publicly lashing out at [LOC CARACAS  ] 00000751 003 OF 003 supporters who are not showing him the respect he thinks he deserves . 
[PER Chavez  ] has also given some of the shortest speeches of his life in recent months . 
We are in no position , however , to assess his state of mental health . 
Generally speaking , however , [PER de Vries'  ] analysis is compelling because [PER Chavez  ] is seeking , with some success , to re-found [MISC Venezuelan  ] society into one that increasingly revolves around him . 
His personality quirks , therefore , will no doubt play an increasing role in how the [LOC Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela  ] is governed .
