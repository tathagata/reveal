REF: [PER A. BERLIN  ] 1601 <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
MUNICH 324 Classified By: Consul General [PER Conrad Tribble  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Support within Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] , s partner [ORG Christian Social Union  ] ( [ORG CSU  ] ) for sending more [MISC German  ] troops to [LOC Afghanistan  ] is not a sure thing . 
[ORG CSU  ] chief and [MISC Bavarian  ] Minister President [PER Seehofer  ] , rattled [MISC German  ] policy makers nationwide when he told Bild on December 7 that he had " little sympathy " for increasing the number of [MISC German  ] soldiers sent to [LOC Afghanistan  ] and that " someone would have to convince him of a clear alternative " and " any further [MISC German  ] engagement had to be linked to a clear exit strategy . 
" [ORG CSU  ] insiders privately regretted [PER Seehofer  ] 's remarks , but the [ORG CSU General Secretary  ] told us that it reflected realistic thinking . 
[PER Edmund Stoiber  ] ( ex-CSU chairman and ex-Minister President ) acknowledged December 10 that the [ORG CSU  ] was not automatically a firm [LOC U.S.  ] ally on this question but said he expected all federal coalition parties to " live up to their responsibility " and take the right decision following the January 28 [LOC Afghanistan  ] conference . 
However , if he is wrong and there are significant defectors in either the [ORG CSU  ] or the [ORG FDP  ] , it will be difficult for even supportive [ORG SPD  ] and [ORG Green  ] parliamentarians to vote in favor of the revised mandate . 
End Summary . 
[PER SEEHOFER  ] MIGHT ECHO POPULAR CONCERNS ------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Echoing concerns expressed privately by some Consulate contacts , many commentators reacted badly to the December 7 timing of [PER Seehofer  ] 's skeptical [LOC Afghanistan  ] remarks . 
They accused him of populist posturing while Defense Minister [PER Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg  ] , also [ORG CSU  ] , was under intense political pressure for the [LOC Kunduz  ] tanker bombing , Ambassador [PER Holbrooke  ] was in [LOC Germany  ] to receive the [ORG Augsburg University Peace Prize  ] , and President [PER Obama  ] was heading to [LOC Oslo  ] to receive the [MISC Nobel Peace Prize  ] . 
However , others acknowledged that [PER Seehofer  ] reflected " proper concerns " and that [LOC Germany  ] " needed to deliberate as carefully as the [LOC U.S.  ] had done before committing new troops . 
" [ORG State Chancellery and Ministry  ] officials , including the [ORG State Secretary for Federal  ] and [ORG European Issues  ] , told the Consul General in a private meeting on December 8 they were " embarrassed by [PER Seehofer  ] 's remarks " and suggested he had reacted " like a populist " to recent opinion polls that showed 69 percent of [MISC Germans  ] opposed sending more [MISC German  ] soldiers to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
( NOTE: Another recent poll reported that 69 percent favored immediate withdrawal . 
) A [ORG CSU  ] contact called us that same morning from party headquarters to express his frustration over [PER Seehofer  ] who had " once again not consulted anybody before giving his two cents . 
" In contrast to this , [ORG CSU  ] Secretary General [PER Alexander Dobrindt  ] told [PER CG Tribble  ] on December 8 that [PER Seehofer  ] 's statement was by no means new but reflected " common [ORG CSU  ] thinking . 
" [PER Seehofer  ] had " said this many times before , " he insisted , without producing proof . 
[ORG AFGHAN ENTANGLEMENTS  ] SPOOK THE [ORG CSU  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [ORG CSU  ] and [LOC Bavaria  ] have a well-documented aversion to sensitive engagements in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The [ORG CSU  ] has refused to accept any of the 17 Uighurs to be released from [LOC Guantanamo  ] , even though [LOC Munich  ] is home to an estimated 500 Uighurs , the largest [MISC Uigher  ] community in [LOC Germany  ] . 
[LOC Bavaria  ] resisted for over a year all entreaties to send police trainers to [LOC Afghanistan  ] ; the first [MISC Bavarian  ] police trainers just left in November after a change of heart by the Interior Minister . 
[ORG CSU Bundestag  ] deputy [PER Peter Gauweiler  ] , together with his [ORG CDU  ] colleague [PER Willy Wimmer  ] , appealed to the [ORG Federal Constitutional Court  ] in March 2007 to rule against [MISC German  ] Tornado reconnaissance aircraft " assisting the [LOC U.S.  ] in a mission in [LOC Afghanistan  ] that was violating international law . 
" In October 2008 , [PER Gauweiler  ] again voted against [MISC German  ] ISAF MUNICH 00000328 002 OF 002 engagement . 
While [PER Gauweiler  ] is generally seen as an outsider within the [ORG CSU  ] party caucus , he may have some secret followers . 
Another [ORG CSU Bundestag  ] deputy , [PER Thomas Silberhorn  ] , said in October that the debate on [LOC Afghanistan  ] " should not be limited to discussing more and more foreign soldiers but rather appealing on [LOC Afghanistan  ] 's own responsibility . 
" CHANCELLOR NEEDS TO WORK HARDER TO CONVINCE THE PUBLIC --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) On December 10 , Ambassador [PER Murphy  ] called on [PER Edmund Stoiber  ] , [MISC Bavarian  ] Minister President from 1993 to 2007 and [ORG CSU  ] party chairman from 1999 to 2007 . 
[PER Stoiber  ] praised the new [ORG U.S. Administration  ] and President [PER Obama  ] 's " courageous and honest " speeches in [LOC West Point  ] and [LOC Oslo  ] . 
He reminded the Ambassador how [MISC German  ] engagement in and responsibility for two world wars had " left marks of deep trauma on the [MISC German  ] people . 
" The largest demonstrations ever , he recalled , occurred in the fifties when over one million [MISC Germans  ] protested [MISC German  ] rearmament . 
The decision to support the [ORG NATO  ] two-track decision in the early 1990 , s even led to the resignation of [PER Helmut Schmidt  ] , one of [LOC Germany  ] 's most popular chancellors . 
[PER Stoiber  ] said he did not expect any new insights from the January 28 [ORG London Afghanistan  ] conference , but he expressed the hope that all parties of the federal government coalition would live up to their responsibilities . 
In order to get broad [ORG CSU  ] support , the leadership had to develop a realistic exit strategy as President [PER Obama  ] had showed the way with his 2011 target for the [LOC United States  ] . 
[PER Stoiber  ] said he had much confidence in Defense Minister [PER Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg  ] ( [ORG CSU  ] ) who was politically well-connected , an expert on foreign policy , and sensitive for what had to be done . 
However , he called on Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] to start a " public relations initiative " aimed at explaining to the [MISC German  ] public why these operations were so vital for [MISC German  ] security interests . 
At the same time , [PER Stoiber  ] predicted the [ORG SPD  ] and [ORG Greens  ] would " return to their anti-war propaganda . 
" Leaders like [PER Gerhard Schroeder  ] and [PER Joschka Fischer  ] had left the political scene , and ex-Foreign Minister [PER Steinmeier  ] was about to get marginalized in the new [ORG SPD  ] . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) At the Consulate in [LOC Munich  ] , we heard unprompted , mostly negative , reactions from [ORG CSU  ] leadership and working level operatives around [PER Seehofer  ] to his skeptical remarks concerning [LOC Germany  ] 's [LOC Afghanistan  ] troop levels . 
However , it is clear that the [ORG CSU  ] is on the fence and remains to be convinced about the need or wisdom of sending additional troops , especially combat troops as opposed to troops sent to train the [ORG Afghan National Army  ] or to provide force protection for police mentoring teams . 
He may be accurately reflecting the opinion of a skeptical [MISC German  ] public that " wants to take its time , just like the [MISC United States' President  ] did . 
" [LOC Embassy Berlin  ] observes that unanimous or near unanimous support from the [ORG CSU  ] is critical to Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] 's goal of obtaining a broad majority in the [ORG Bundestag  ] for a revised ISAF mandate after the [ORG London Conference  ] . 
If there are significant defectors in either the [ORG CSU  ] or the [ORG FDP  ] , where there is also significant skepticism about a troop increase , it will be difficult for even supportive [ORG SPD  ] and [ORG Green  ] parliamentarians to vote in favor of the revised mandate. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 .
