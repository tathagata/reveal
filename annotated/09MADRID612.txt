( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC SUMMARY: When Spanish Defense Minister  ] [PER Carme Chacon  ] arrives in [LOC Washington  ] June 30 , she will be looking among other things to restore and consolidate her image as the rising star and heir-apparent of President [PER Zapatero  ] 's cabinet . 
Since taking office in April 2008 , [PER Chacon  ] has talked of the importance she places on close ties with her [LOC U.S.  ] counterparts and of her desire to go to [LOC Washington  ] . 
The first woman to head [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] and the first Minister to give birth while in office , [PER Chacon  ] met with only one bilateral ambassador , then-U.S . 
Ambassador to [LOC Spain  ] [PER Eduardo Aguirre  ] , during her 2008 maternity leave ( ref F ) , as a demonstration of the significance of the bilateral relationship . 
Twice nominated and invited previously to participate in the 2002 and 2003 [ORG U.S. International Visitor Programs  ] , [PER Chacon  ] had up to that point never traveled to the [LOC United States  ] and has yet to do so in an official capacity . 
Although well connected and politically savvy , her relative inexperience in defense issues , particularly in coordination among [ORG NATO  ] allies , has led to mis-steps and put her on the defensive against opposition attacks in the lead-up to June 7 [ORG European Parliament  ] elections . 
On the eve of her July 1 meeting with Secretary [PER Gates  ] , [PER Chacon  ] has more to prove domestically than ever before . 
While the conservative opposition has used a series of recent faux pas for political mudslinging , [PER Chacon  ] 's personal standing is undiminished , and in public opinion polls she is held in higher regard than [PER Zapatero  ] . 
USG interlocutors should by no means underestimate her , or the importance ministry places on a successful visit . 
While the focus of [PER Chacon  ] 's trip will be bilateral issues -- including the [ORG U.S.-Spain Agreement  ] on [ORG Defense Cooperation  ] ( [ORG ADC  ] ) and [LOC U.S.  ] plans to re-open the KC-30 tanker competition -- she will review existing operations including [MISC Spanish  ] participation in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and in counter-piracy efforts , as lead in the [ORG EU  ] Atalanta mission . 
She is also expected to address [ORG GOS  ] interest in closer [MISC U.S.-EU  ] ties and civilian-military coordination during [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG European Union  ] ( [ORG EU  ] ) Presidency January-June 2010 . 
While in [LOC Washington  ] , she will also lay a wreath at [ORG Arlington National Cemetery  ] , decorate former [MISC CJCS  ] [PER Peter Pace  ] and former [ORG SACEUR  ] NSA [PER James Jones  ] , and address the [ORG Organization of American States  ] . 
END SUMMARY. //BILATERAL RELATIONS// <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG U.S.-Spain  ] relations are strong and based on shared global interests . 
[LOC Spain  ] is an important friend and ally of the [LOC U.S.  ] , and we value its cooperation in the fights against terrorism and narcotics and on security issues . 
[LOC Spain  ] has approximately 3000 troops deployed in hot spots such as [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( over 800 ) , [LOC Lebanon  ] ( over 1,100 ) , [LOC Bosnia  ] ( approximately 260 ) , [LOC Indian Ocean  ] / [LOC Somalia  ] ( over 300 ) , [LOC Kosovo  ] ( nearly 500 ) , and in various [ORG UN  ] & [ORG EU  ] observer missions . 
[LOC Spain  ] announced at international conferences in March and April a temporary increase of 450 troops in [LOC Afghanistan  ] to assist with forthcoming elections . 
[LOC Spain  ] has long fought a domestic terrorist threat from the [MISC Basque  ] terrorist group [ORG ETA  ] and suffered tragically from [MISC Islamic  ] extremist terrorism in the 2004 [ORG Madrid  ] train bombings . 
Since winning a second term in March 2008 , but especially since the [LOC U.S.  ] election in November 2008 , President [PER Zapatero  ] has publicly and privately stressed his desire to further improve bilateral relations , and a strong atmosphere of goodwill has emerged in [LOC Spain  ] for closer bilateral cooperation . 
As a gesture of this goodwill , the [ORG GOS  ] presently is considering accepting up to five of the detainees currently held [LOC Guantanamo  ] . 
[MISC Counter-terrorism  ] and law-enforcement cooperation is strong , as are commercial and cultural relations ( e.g. , tourism ) . 
Finally , [LOC Spain  ] is a leader in renewable energy technologies and has important investments in the [LOC U.S.  ] in this field ( e.g. , wind and solar ) , as well as in road construction projects . 
The relationship will be of increasing importance when [LOC Spain  ] takes over the [ORG EU  ] presidency in January 2010. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Minister [PER Chacon  ] is visiting [LOC Washington  ] on the heels of a very successful visit to [LOC Washington  ] by her chief rival in the cabinet , Interior Minister [PER Rubalcaba  ] , who met with [ORG DHS  ] and [ORG DOJ  ] officials as well as intelligence chiefs June 23-24 ( ref B ) . 
The two visits are but the latest in a series of high-level exchanges , including a presidential bilateral on the margins of the [LOC U.S.-EU Summit  ] in [LOC Prague  ] in April , a meeting between NSA [PER Jones  ] and King [PER Juan Carlos  ] I in [LOC Florida  ] in February , and Foreign Minister Moratinos 's February meeting in [LOC Washington  ] with Secretary [PER Clinton  ] . 
At the end of May , [LOC U.S.  ] Transportation Secretary [PER LaHood  ] became the first cabinet-level visitor to [LOC Spain  ] on behalf of the [ORG Obama Administration  ] , and [ORG Homeland Security  ] Secretary [PER Napolitano  ] will travel to [ORG Madrid  ] while [PER Chacon  ] is in [LOC Washington.  ] //POLITICAL [LOC OVERVIEW//  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In office since 2004 , [PER Zapatero  ] won reelection to a second term in March 2008 , but his center-left [MISC Spanish  ] Socialist [ORG Workers Party  ] ( [ORG PSOE  ] ) is seven seats shy of a majority in the 350-seat [ORG Congress  ] . 
More than a year of worse-than-expected economic news has led to widespread criticism of [PER Zapatero  ] and his economic policymakers for having downplayed the economic difficulties . 
Although popularity ratings for [PER Zapatero  ] and the Socialists are low , the conservative opposition [ORG Popular Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) has struggled to capitalize on this , including by attacking [PER Carme Chacon  ] . 
The [ORG PP  ] has suffered internal divisions and more recently has been dogged by corruption accusations . 
Nevertheless , [PER Zapatero  ] suffered his first serious political reverse since winning reelection when his party lost power in March 2009 regional elections in [LOC Galicia  ] . 
[PER Zapatero  ] shuffled the cabinet April 7 as a response to criticism of the GOS' inability to resolve the economic crisis and with an eye to the June [ORG European Parliament  ] elections . 
The most prominent change was the replacement of the Second Vice President and Minister of Economy/Finance . 
Even so , the [ORG PP  ] secured more seats than the Socialists in the June 7 [ORG European Parliament  ] elections , dealing a further blow to [ORG Zapatero.  ] //DEFENSE [ORG TIES//  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Spain  ] is an excellent defense partner with whom the [LOC United States  ] enjoys robust military-to-military relations based on cooperation within [ORG NATO  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] presence at [LOC Spain  ] 's bases ( approximately 1335 personnel primarily located at [LOC Naval Station Rota  ] and [LOC Moron Air Base  ] ) , and [ORG U.S. Foreign Military Sales  ] ( [MISC FMS  ] ) to [LOC Spain  ] . 
The southern [MISC Spanish  ] bases of [LOC Rota  ] and [LOC Moron  ] are strategic hubs , midway between the [LOC U.S.  ] and theaters of operation in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[LOC U.S.  ] planes and ships account for approximately 6,000 flights and 200 port calls a year in [LOC Spain  ] . 
[LOC Spain  ] remains a leading [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC FMS  ] client , with [MISC USD  ] $3.2 billion worth of open [MISC FMS  ] cases . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] military , especially the [ORG Navy  ] ( [ORG SPN  ] ) , is familiar with [LOC U.S.  ] equipment and tactics . 
The [ORG SPN  ] employs the [LOC AEGIS  ] system on its frigates , and is interested in the [ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] ( [ORG JSF  ] ) . 
At the same time , the [MISC Spanish  ] defense industry is a [LOC U.S.  ] supplier , as with the [ORG United States Coast Guard  ] ( [ORG USCG  ] ) purchase of eight [MISC EADS-CASA CN-235-300M  ] maritime patrol aircraft ( 245 million [MISC USD  ] total ) . 
Overall , the [MISC Spanish  ] military is pro-U.S. and pro-NATO. //CHACON IN THE HOT SEAT// <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Chacon  ] has been on the defensive against opposition attacks over her handling of a trifecta of thorny issues in the past three months . 
[LOC Spain  ] 's announced withdrawal of troops from [ORG KFOR  ] in mid-March was widely criticized not for the substance of the decision so much as for the apparent lack of coordination -- since refuted by the [ORG GOS  ] -- of the decision internally as well as with [ORG NATO  ] Allies ( ref C ) . 
Vice President [PER Biden  ] clarified to reporters March 28 in [LOC Chile  ] that the [ORG U.S.-Spain  ] bilateral relationship exceeded any disagreement over [LOC Kosovo  ] , and [MISC Spanish  ] leaders publicly touted " absolute ( [LOC U.S  ] . 
) understanding of the [MISC Spanish  ] decision . 
" [PER Chacon  ] survived a congressional censure motion brought by opposition critics over her handling of the withdrawal , which began the end of April and will be accomplished by the end of the summer. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In mid-May , [PER Chacon  ] was again criticized for poor coordination and inadequate public information regarding an outbreak of [MISC H1N1  ] flu at a military academy outside [LOC Madrid  ] . 
A group of school children had been allowed to visit the installation two days after the first symptoms were reported . 
Testifying May 26 in the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG Senate  ] and May 27 in the [ORG Congress  ] , [PER Chacon  ] fiercely defended her ministry , s role in containing the [MISC H1N1  ] outbreak , insisted her ministry had followed all [ORG World Health Organization  ] ( [ORG WHO  ] ) protocols in coordinating with [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG Health Ministry  ] , and accused an opposition questioner of fear-mongering . 
( NOTE: [LOC Spain  ] had at least 537 confirmed cases of the [MISC H1N1  ] virus by mid-June ( up from 167 at the end of May ) , making it the most affected [MISC European  ] country by virtue of daily flights from [LOC Mexico  ] and various [LOC U.S.  ] points of origin . 
All the victims are reported to have mild systems and be responding well to treatment . 
Health Minister [PER Trinidad Jimenez  ] announced June 12 her ministry would not continue to report new cases , in order to avoid the " numbers dance , " since the origin of all the cases was clear . 
END NOTE . 
) <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC H1N1  ] incident is but one anecdote in a recent series of opposition attacks on perceived blunders by the [ORG Zapatero Administration  ] in the lead up to [MISC European  ] Parliament elections June 7 , in which the Socialists fared poorly . 
On June 10 , [PER Chacon  ] was forced to make statements denying [MISC Spanish  ] involvement in detention of [MISC Israeli  ] spies in [LOC Lebanon  ] after a video conference with [MISC Spanish  ] military commanders the previous week was broadcast by media who had been invited to film the onset of the meeting . 
The [ORG Defense Ministry  ] later asserted the arrests were carried out by [ORG Lebanese Security Forces  ] in an area of southern [LOC Lebanon  ] controlled by [MISC Spanish  ] troops in coordination with [ORG UNIFIL  ] . 
The conservative opposition [ORG Popular Party  ] continues to allege [PER Chacon  ] knows of [MISC Spanish  ] involvement and has demanded she clarify the [ORG GOS  ] 's role in the operations . 
So far , [PER Chacon  ] seems to have weathered and learned from the criticism and perhaps come out stronger for having kept her composure under pressure. //CHACON'S [LOC WASHINGTON  ] AGENDA// <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Post expects Minister [PER Chacon  ] will use her time with Secretary [PER Gates  ] to review current [MISC Spanish  ] operations and to place a marker on future discussions of the Agreement on [ORG Defense Cooperation  ] ( [ORG ADC  ] ) . 
She may also raise the long-term resolution -- important to [LOC Spain  ] for supplying its troops in [LOC Afghanistan  ] -- of the [LOC Manas Transit Base  ] . 
Any discussion of industrial participation or pending defense contracts should be considered in the context of [LOC Spain  ] 's budget woes and severe recession . 
The latest [ORG OECD  ] prediction is that the [MISC Spanish  ] economy will shrink by 4.2 per cent this year and unemployment is expected to reach 20 per cent by 2010 . 
The economic slump has the potential to affect political-military relations inasmuch as the [ORG GOS  ] is feeling pressure to prevent further job losses , including potential cuts in DOD contracts. //AGREEMENT ON DEFENSE COOPERATION// <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) MOD staff do not expect [PER Chacon  ] to discuss the future of the [ORG ADC  ] . 
If raised , we believe the Defense Minister could lay out a broad way ahead on this issue , and we understand her staff has advised her that only minor changes or technical adjustments are necessary . 
The current [ORG ADC  ] is in effect until February 2011 and three potential directions exist: complete re-negotiation , minor improvements , or continue as is with automatic extension . 
Secretary General for [ORG Defense Policy  ] ( [ORG SEGENPOL  ] ) [PER Luis Cuesta  ] indicated June 18 to [LOC OSD  ] staff [LOC Spain  ] 's overall satisfaction with the [ORG ADC  ] ( ref A ) . 
[MISC Spanish  ] interlocutors have further advised us even " improvements " are off the table until the middle of 2010 , once [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG EU  ] presidency is completed . 
In fall 2008 , however , [PER Chacon  ] had raised the idea of elevating the status of the document from an international agreement to treaty ( refs D and E ) . 
We believe [LOC U.S.  ] efforts and those of her own staff have dissuaded her of that notion. //POSSIBLE CUTBACKS AT [LOC ROTA  ] AND MORON// <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Minister [PER Chacon  ] 's visit presents an opportunity to reiterate how much we value the use of [LOC Rota  ] and [LOC Moron  ] . 
Access to both bases is an excellent example of a balanced and mature defense relationship that brings great security benefits to both our countries and serves as a cornerstone of the larger bilateral relationship . 
Nonetheless , the [ORG U.S. Air Force  ] in [LOC Europe  ] ( [ORG USAFE  ] ) has been deliberating since 2006 and is in the final stages of a pre-decisional draft plan to cut costs at [LOC Moron  ] by eliminating several hundred [MISC Spanish  ] jobs . 
Assuming [ORG USAFE  ] pursues the matter , the plan will be considered by the highest levels of the [ORG GOS  ] and could end up costing a lot more financially and politically than the [ORG Air Force  ] is likely to save annually . 
Relatively minor labor issues involving [MISC Spanish  ] employees at those bases go straight to the Presidency . 
The potential for massive personnel cuts resulting from cost reductions at [LOC Moron  ] and simultaneous budget cuts at [LOC Rota  ] would rise to [ORG Zapatero  ] 's level . 
Coupled with unemployment at 18 per cent and rising -- the highest in the [ORG European Union  ] -- and a severe recession , such changes could cause a number of problems , the least of which might be a complete re-look at the [ORG ADC  ] . 
Strikes and lawsuits are possible . 
Other possible ramifications of large manpower cuts include strained relations , anti-American sentiment , impact on the ease of operations on these bases including complications for aircraft clearances ( currently 6,000/year ) , and attempts to mitigate financial losses in the form of additional taxes and landing fees . 
DOD should also consider the potential impact on current military operations of , in one worst-case scenario , the forced removal by [ORG GOS  ] of all [LOC U.S.  ] forces from [LOC Moron  ] . 
The autonomous community where the bases are located is a key stronghold of the President 's party ( indeed , the " governor " of that region was elevated in April to the President 's cabinet ) . 
Any attempt in tough economic times to cut several hundred [MISC Spanish  ] contract jobs at the bases would be controversial and would at a minimum diminish [ORG GOS  ] interest in allowing us continued access . 
While we have no indications that Minister [PER Chacon  ] is aware of the [LOC Moron  ] possibility at this time , the Embassy is discussing scenarios with [ORG USAFE  ] and so many people know about the issue that we should be prepared for the possibility the [MISC Spanish  ] might have gotten wind of it . 
If and when they do , we should expect significant political blowback that could bleed over into other areas of the mil-mil relationship ( indeed , into the entire bilateral relationship ) . //PALOMARES// <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) One issue [PER Chacon  ] might possibly raise is [ORG GOS  ] interest in [ORG USG  ] participation in a final cleanup of the [LOC Palomares  ] radiation site that was contaminated in 1966 when three hydrogen bombs fell near the town of [ORG Palomares  ] after a collision of a [MISC USAF B-52  ] and a [ORG USAF  ] refueling tanker aircraft . 
The site was cleaned according to standards of the time , and radioactive soil and vegetation was shipped to the [LOC United States  ] . 
The [ORG Department of Energy  ] has helped fund health and environmental monitoring for decades , along with a recently completed [ORG GOS  ] study that outlined the considerable amount of remaining contamination . 
The [MISC Spanish Embassy  ] sent a diplomatic note in March asking for [ORG USG  ] participants in a working group to define collaboration responsibilities for a final cleanup . 
The [ORG USG  ] has not responded , and post understands that DOD is seeking to determine its position . 
In reftel G , Post recommended an interagency meeting to determine a [ORG USG  ] response . 
Minister [PER Chacon  ] has not been closely involved in the issue in the past , but the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] 's Director General for [MISC North American  ] Affairs raised the issue with [ORG EUR A/S Gordon  ] in a recent meeting , and [ORG GOS  ] frustration over the lack of a response to the diplomatic note may lead [PER Chacon  ] to do so as well. //AFGHANISTAN// <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [LOC Spain  ] has invested about 300 million [MISC Euros  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , including development assistance pledged since 2006 and more recent monetary support pledged since March to the [ORG Election Trust Fund  ] and the [ORG ANA Trust Fund  ] . 
[MISC Spanish  ] officials have also indicated [LOC Spain  ] will contribute more money for infrastructure ( road from [MISC North-South  ] of [MISC RC-W  ] ) in excess of [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG London Conference  ] pledge ( ref A ) . 
Militarily speaking , [LOC Spain  ] has deployed more than 800 troops under [ORG ISAF  ] . 
[LOC Spain  ] shares responsibility with the [MISC Italians  ] for a [ORG Forward Support Base  ] in [LOC Herat  ] , where it has two OMLTs , and is running a provincial reconstruction team in [LOC Qal-e-Now  ] , in [LOC Badghis  ] province . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] have begun construction on a base for the [ORG ANA  ] battalion [LOC Spain  ] is sponsoring and , adjacent to that facility , a new facility for the [ORG PRT  ] . 
In Post 's assessment , [LOC Spain  ] is doing what it does well , but could do even more. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Minister [PER Chacon  ] testified before the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG Congressional Defense Committee  ] and secured parliamentary authorization and funding June 17 for [MISC Spanish  ] contributions to the [ORG Elections Security Forces  ] ( [ORG ESF  ] ) , scheduled to deploy temporarily in support of [MISC Afghan  ] elections for three to four months . 
In addition to the 450 temporary troops for the [MISC Afghan  ] elections ( to be deployed in mid-July ) , the [ORG Committee  ] authorized longer-term deployments of 70 guards for [ORG Kabul International Airport  ] and 12 instructors to train the [ORG Afghan National Army  ] . 
The authorization also included 33 armored vehicles to increase the total number of [MISC Spanish  ] armored vehicles in [LOC Afghanistan  ] to 93 . 
[PER Chacon  ] requested and received funding for the 450-troop battalion to stay one month beyond the elections , to allow for a second round of voting , if necessary . 
COMMENT: It is possible a company ( out of a battalion to be dedicated to the [ORG ESF  ] ) may remain in [LOC Afghanistan  ] after the 3-4 month timeframe is completed , pending the security situation following the elections , when [LOC Spain  ] would determine whether it should or could leave some of its [ORG ESF  ] battalion behind . 
END COMMENT . 
Regardless of what happens with the [ORG ESF  ] , [LOC Spain  ] will take the lead for security operations at [ORG Kabul International Airport  ] ( [ORG KAIA  ] ) from the [MISC Polish  ] contingent from October 2009 through April 2010 , and [LOC Spain  ] will provide 40 [ORG Civil Guard  ] personnel to either [ORG NTM-A  ] or [ORG European Gendarmerie Force  ] ( [ORG EGF  ] ) ( ref A ) . <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [MISC Spanish  ] Chief of Defense GEN [PER Rodriguez  ] met in [LOC Kabul  ] the week of June 22 with [ORG COMISAF General McChrystal  ] . 
[MISC Spanish  ] Joint Staff said the encounter could not have been better , describing it as " exceptional " and oriented to the future . 
Following on what the [MISC Spanish  ] perceived to be a fruitful and positive visit both with [ORG COMISAF  ] and with Commander of the [ORG Combined Security and Transition Command  ] - [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( [MISC CSTC-A  ] ) , General Formica , this July 1 meeting would be a key opportunity to ask directly at the highest level to underscore any stated [ORG COMISAF  ] needs and expectations in the [MISC Spanish  ] sector , reinforce military requirements which [LOC Spain  ] could provide , and request [LOC Spain  ] demonstrate leadership in other key areas . 
Possible opportunities that [LOC Spain  ] could seize , if asked , include: extending promised [MISC Spanish  ] election support in place beyond August 20 ; lengthening time between rotations to improve continuity in the regional command ; expansion to the north ; not moving [MISC Spanish  ] helicopters from the [ORG PRT  ] back to [LOC Herat  ] ; and following through on [LOC Spain  ] 's formalized sponsorship of [MISC Colombian  ] troops to serve alongside [MISC Spanish  ] forces in [LOC Badghis  ] . 
If there is no possibility that the [LOC United States  ] will fund airlift for [MISC Colombian  ] troops going to serve with [LOC Spain  ] 's contingent in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , we should be clear about our expectations and limitations , in order to avoid any hard feelings over the potentially earlier arrival of any [MISC U.S.-sponsored Colombian Special Forces.  ] <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) COMMENT: In the lead up to the strategic review of [MISC U.S.-Afghanistan  ] policy , [MISC Spanish  ] leadership here in [LOC Madrid  ] stressed that [LOC Spain  ] needed to be asked directly and at the highest level for more support in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Absent a very direct request to fulfill requirements in RC-West or elsewhere , [MISC Spanish  ] officials can claim to be off the hook . 
Even with a high-level political intervention , the [MISC Spanish  ] may resist additional contributions or plead a lack of [MISC Spanish  ] public support for the mission . 
That being said , without a high-level discussion , we are nearly certain that none of the election support forces will stay in [ORG ISAF  ] after the [MISC Afghan  ] election . 
This is our opportunity to tell Minister [PER Chacon  ] exactly what else [LOC Spain  ] could do , at a time when she needs to maintain the upward trend in her political standing . 
After receiving negative press over the [LOC Kosovo  ] withdrawal , [PER Chacon  ] appears to be working consciously on improving her image and her media posture , and her [LOC Washington  ] schedule positions her for critically important photo opportunities . 
We hope she has also learned something about proper consultation among Allies . 
Any number of the hot issues raised here , improperly handled in the current economic climate , could severely undermine [PER Chacon  ] , erode expressions of goodwill , and threaten our future operational effectiveness .
