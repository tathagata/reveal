( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Begin  ] unofficial translation . 
[LOC Montevideo  ] , March 27 , 2008 Mr. President: I have the pleasure to contact Your Excellency in order to make you aware that my Government finds itself devoted to the task of clarifying all of the episodes of human rights violations which occurred in my country during the period of the military regime , about which exists substantial information that originates from the declassification of [ORG Department of State  ] files . 
My Government hopes to count on the cooperation of the [LOC United States  ] of [LOC America  ] in the clarification of all the cases of disappearances and human rights violations in that painful period of the history of [LOC Uruguay  ] which took place between 1973 and 1985 . 
In that regard , please allow me to request the cooperation of Mr. President in the adoption of the measures necessary so that the documents which would permit the clarification of the death due to poisoning of Mrs. [PER Cecilia Fontana  ] de [PER Heber  ] , a political crime which occurred on the 6th of September , 1978 , as well as the documents related to our country during the aforementioned historical period , be unsealed in their totality . 
A portion of these documents were partially declassified at the beginning of this year by the [ORG Department of State  ] . 
I avail myself of this opportunity to reiterate to Your Excellency the assurances of my most high and distinguished consideration and personal esteem . 
( Signed ) Dr. [PER Tabare Vazquez  ] President of the [ORG Oriental Republic of Uruguay  ] End unofficial translation . 
Background ---------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In August 1978 , Senator [PER Carlos Julio Pereyra  ] ( Chairman of the [ORG House of Representatives  ] ) , Senator [PER Mario Heber  ] and Representative [PER Luis Alberto Lacalle  ] ( later President of the [LOC Republic  ] ) , each received a bottle of white wine wrapped in blue paper from an unknown source . 
The three democratically-elected congressmen belonged to the National ( [ORG Blanco  ] ) party . 
As was discovered later , the three wine bottles contained a powerful poison . 
While none of the congressmen touched the wine , Mrs. [PER Fontana  ] de [PER Heber  ] ( the wife of Senator [PER Heber  ] ) drank some of it and subsequently died . 
The perpetrators of the crime were never identified . 
When the [ORG Frente Amplio  ] party assumed power in 2005 , it promised to account for all human rights abuses committed during the dictatorship period . 
Since then , the Blancos have complained that the [ORG FA  ] has only pursued cases connected to its members and its sympathizers. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) A similar letter to POTUS and FOIA requests were made by a group of [MISC Uruguayan  ] deputies last year regarding the poison wine case . 
The [ORG State Department  ] declassified some documents related to the case . 
The [ORG CIA  ] did not , citing concerns about the compromise of sources and methods . 
Many [MISC Uruguayans  ] remain unsatisfied with the [ORG USG  ] response and are convinced that the [ORG USG  ] possesses useful information about the death of Mrs. [PER Heber  ] . 
Comment ------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOU  ] is under political pressure to account for all the human rights abuses committed during the 'd irty war' period . 
We believe that , in this particular case , the [PER Heber  ] relatives understand that the [ORG USG  ] does not have any information on the perpetrator of this thirty year old crime . 
However , in this incipient campaign season , other political actors are finding the repeated requests for [ORG USG  ] information to be a convenient way to put political pressure on the [ORG Frente Amplio  ] government , for whatever reason . 
This is probably the driving force behind President [PER Vazquez  ] letter to President Bush. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [LOC Uruguay  ] 's far-leftist groups regularly resort to human rights as an anti-U.S. rallying cry . 
Even mainstream press coverage here tends to reinforce the assertion that leftists are the only " true " defenders of human rights . 
Meanwhile , declassified [LOC U.S.  ] documents from the period around the [MISC Uruguayan  ] dictatorship have been used to fuel the fire . 
For instance , [LOC Venezuela  ] 's [ORG Telesur  ] continually broadcasts accusations that the [LOC U.S.  ] sponsored " [MISC Plan Condor  ] , " while it flashes snippets of declassified documents as " proof . 
" Embassy believes that it is in the [LOC U.S.  ] interest to respond quickly , and if possible responsively , to [PER Vazquez'  ] letter as a way to counter some of these accusations .
