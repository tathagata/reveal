Summary: ( C ) Federal Deputies will probably unceremoniously drop their investigation into the departure of two [MISC Cuban  ] boxers who apparently tried to defect at the [MISC Pan Am Games  ] but later were repatriated to [LOC Cuba  ] . 
Unable to gain traction on the issue outside of [ORG Congress  ] , and stymied by the [MISC Cuban  ] [ORG Embassy  ] 's refusal to issue them [MISC Cuban  ] visas , the Deputies can do little more to ascertain the true circumstances of the boxers' hasty departure from [LOC Brazil  ] ( reftel ) . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Following news reports that the [MISC Cuban  ] [ORG Embassy  ] had informed the [MISC Brazilian  ] Government it would deny visas to [MISC Brazilian  ] deputies interested in visiting the island to meet with the two [MISC Cuban  ] boxers , [ORG Poloff  ] met with Chairman of the Foreign Relations and [ORG National Defense Committee  ] ( [ORG CREDN  ] ) [PER Carlos Eduardo Vieira  ] da [PER Cunha  ] ( PDT , [ORG Democratic Workers Party  ] , governing coalition ; of [LOC Rio Grande  ] do Sul ) and [ORG CREDN  ] member Federal Deputy [PER Raul Jungmann  ] ( [ORG PPS  ] , Socialist [ORG People 's Party  ] , opposition ; of [LOC Pernambuco  ] ) . 
Both had pressed the [PER Lula  ] government to account for the [MISC Brazilian  ] government 's actions in quickly dispatching the two athletes back to [LOC Cuba  ] after their supposed change of heart and had claimed they would continue investigating the issue . 
Both expressed sympathy for the boxers , and indicated they believed the boxers probably did request to return to [LOC Cuba  ] , although according to [PER Jungmann  ] , it is highly likely they did so under duress . 
Neither had any evidence for this , however , and in the absence of any corroborating information or an interview with the two [MISC Cuban  ] boxers , there was little else they could do. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Even though visibly discouraged by the presumed denial of the visa , [PER Jungmann  ] stated he had referred the matter to the [MISC Chamber  ] presidency , which approves all travel by members of the [MISC Chamber  ] . 
[PER Jungmann  ] indicated that the institution 's honor demanded that a formal petition for a visa had to be made to force the [MISC Cuban  ] government to be on record as actually denying the visa request . 
It was not clear to [LOC Jungman  ] , however , whether the [MISC Chamber  ] leadership would approve the request. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Comment: With no new information , no public outcry , and little support beyond some opposition party members , opposition deputies have little ability to continue to push the investigation or to use the [MISC Cuban  ] boxer 's saga as a cudgel against the [PER Lula  ] administration . 
The fact that the [ORG Workers Party  ] controlled [MISC Chamber  ] leadership in a largely pro-government [ORG Congress  ] would refuse to take further action on the issue is not surprising , despite the fact that the trip was formally initiated through a favorable committee vote and specifically couched as intended to investigate the actions of the Government of [LOC Brazil  ] . 
More interesting is that the presumed visa denial did not provoke much institutional consternation in [ORG Congress  ] or from the normally prickly foreign ministry .
