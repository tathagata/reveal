( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] The upcoming winter session of Parliament in mid-November and [LOC Gujarat  ] state assembly elections in mid-December will play a key role in shaping GOI actions on the [MISC US-India  ] civil nuclear agreement . 
The respective positions of the [ORG Congress Party  ] and the Left parties are likely to be fine-tuned in a series of inter-party and intra-party meetings in the days before Parliament begins debate on the agreement on or around November 19 . 
The debate will be unpredictable but vigorous , with a great deal of high rhetoric and low tactics by all the parties . 
If the [ORG UPA  ] emerges from the debate with no clear “sense of the [ORG House”  ] against the deal , it will look for opportunities to move forward on discussions with the [ORG IAEA  ] . 
Most observers believe that the [LOC Gujarat  ] elections in mid-December will provide the true test of [ORG UPA  ] government’s approach on the agreement . 
If the [ORG Congress Party  ] puts in a good performance in this [ORG BJP  ] stronghold , it might feel politically strong enough to challenge the Left parties by moving forward with the [ORG IAEA  ] on the safeguards agreement at the risk of ( or even the desire for ) early mid-term polls . 
However , Mrs. [PER Gandhi  ] never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to show real leadership . 
While remaining publicly restrained and taking care not to be seen as interfering with domestic [MISC Indian  ] politics , the Embassy will continue to meet with all political , business and civil society parties and interest groups to urge them to support the agreement . 
End Summary . 
[ORG Timetable Ahead of Parliamentary Debate  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) With the first few days of the session devoted to housekeeping matters , Parliament is expected to take up serious business on November 19 . 
This date is significant for Parliamentary debate on the [MISC US-India  ] civil nuclear initiative because it follows closely four other meetings: -- November 11-12: Meeting of [ORG Communist Party  ] - [ORG Marxist  ] politburo meeting ; -- November 16: Meeting of the [MISC UPA-Left  ] coordination committee on the [MISC US-India  ] civil nuclear agreement , unless that meeting is postponed ; -- November 16: Meeting of the [ORG Congress Working Committee  ] , the highest decision-making body of the [ORG Congress Party  ] ; and -- November 17: Meeting of the [ORG All India Congress Committee  ] , the broadest and most representative body of the [ORG Congress Party  ] . 
Avoiding Monsoon Session Gridlock --------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The discussion and decisions taken at these meetings will feed directly into the Parliamentary debate that follows . 
In the monsoon session in August , boisterous disruptions by the [ORG Left  ] parties and the opposition [ORG Bharatiya Janata Party  ] ( [ORG BJP  ] ) over the nuclear initiative paralyzed Parliamentary business . 
The [ORG UPA  ] government is hoping to avoid a similar scene during the winter session because the principal players appear to have recently pulled back somewhat from the confrontational approach they held in [LOC August-October  ] . 
Positive Developments: Left Parties ----------------------------------- NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00004881 002 OF 003 <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [MISC US-India  ] civil nuclear initiative still faces an uphill road ( Ref G ) but there have been developments in recent days that bode well for the government , if not for quick completion of the nuclear deal . 
The [ORG Left  ] parties , while continuing to reiterate their firm opposition to the civil nuclear agreement , have gone out of their way to reject the notion of early parliamentary elections. “There is no threat to the [ORG UPA  ] government , ” [ORG Communist Party Marxist General  ] Secretary [PER Prakash Karat  ] told reporters on October 30 . 
Some see this as a glimmer of hope that the [ORG Left  ] may not force the collapse of the [ORG UPA  ] government if the Prime Minister moves forward on the [ORG IAEA  ] safeguards agreement . 
This is reassuring to [ORG UPA  ] allies such as Railway Minister [PER Lalu Prasad Yadav  ] of the [ORG Rashtriya Janata Dal  ] , [PER Sharad Pawar  ] of the [ORG Nationalist Congress Party  ] and [ORG Karunanidhi  ] of the [PER Dravida Munnetra Kazagham  ] , all of whom , deathly afraid of early elections , pressured the [ORG UPA  ] government to slow down progress on the agreement . 
The [ORG Left  ] parties have also taken pains recently to be conciliatory towards the Prime Minister and his stand on the [MISC US-India  ] agreement after having attacked him sharply during the last two months . 
Positive Developments: [ORG BJP  ] -------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [ORG BJP  ] , while it continues to speak with many conflicting voices , appears to have softened its opposition to the agreement , in part , due to the Ambassador’s meetings with [ORG BJP  ] leaders ( Ref A , D , E ) . 
A party spokesman said on October 30 that the [ORG BJP  ] will not insist , as it did during the monsoon session , that debate on the agreement be conducted under Parliamentary rules that require a vote , something the [ORG UPA  ] government had refused to do . 
The [ORG BJP  ] spokesman also noted that his party will drop its monsoon session demand for the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee to examine the agreement . 
Perhaps the most important [ORG BJP  ] pronouncement on the issue was made by Leader of the Opposition [PER L.K. Advani  ] , who supported the call for a full Parliamentary debate but pointed out that the government is not constitutionally bound to accept the opinion of Parliament on this issue , rebuffing Karat’s shrill insistence on an enhanced , more formal role for Parliament in [MISC Indian  ] foreign policy formulation . 
. 
Positive Developments: [ORG Congress  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Since the October 12 reversal by [PER Sonia Gandhi  ] and the Prime Minister on the [MISC US-India  ] agreement ( Ref L ) , the [ORG Congress Party  ] appears to be stiffening its back a little . 
The Prime Minister and the party have acknowledged a “delay in operationalizing” the agreement but have repeatedly reiterated their commitment to finalizing the deal . 
The Prime Minister made this observation after his October 30 meeting with [MISC German  ] Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] . 
He assured [ORG Treasury  ] Secretary [PER Paulson  ] on October 29 that the government was fully SIPDIS committed to the agreement ( Ref B ) and were exploring various ways of getting it through the domestic obstacles . 
Speaking at a November 5 conference , he called critics of the nuclear initiative “myopic.” [ORG Unpredictable Debate  ] -------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) It is difficult to foretell how the Parliamentary debate over the agreement will turn out . 
The [ORG Left  ] has been assiduously courting regional parties in recent days and several of these parties have expressed solidarity with the Left’s position . 
Yet , the regional parties do not have strong ideological or policy positions on the agreement . 
What concerns them most is whether or not the deal leads to early elections . 
The [MISC BJP’s  ] confused stance has become even more muddled now with some leaders softening their positions but others not getting the memo . 
The [ORG BJP  ] will sit down before the winter session to iron out its party line and make sure its [MISC Parliamentarians  ] stick with it. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Given that the [ORG Left  ] parties are unlikely to relent from their opposition to the agreement , the best outcome for the [ORG UPA  ] ( and the deal ) will be if the [ORG Left  ] parties are isolated in the debate while the [ORG BJP  ] expresses criticism , but remains uncommitted -- similar to the position taken by the [ORG Left  ] in previous nuclear debates . 
The worst outcome would be NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00004881 003 OF 003 if the [ORG Left  ] , [ORG BJP  ] and the regional parties corner the [ORG UPA  ] and the “sense of the [MISC House”  ] is clearly against the agreement . 
The most likely scenario is somewhere in the middle with a vigorous debate but both sides claiming victory . 
If this happens , the [ORG UPA  ] government might plausibly take steps to move forward on the deal , if it can find the courage to do so . 
[ORG Gujarat Elections Holds  ] the Key ------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Embassy agrees with many observers who believe that if the Parliamentary debate is a draw , the [LOC Gujarat  ] election result in December are crucial to whether [ORG Congress Party  ] moves forward with the nuclear agreement . 
[LOC Gujarat  ] is a large state , with 26 seats in Parliament . 
It is a prosperous state which is leading the [MISC Indian  ] economic resurgence . 
It is also one of the most “saffron” states in the country . 
The [ORG BJP  ] has won the last five state assembly elections . 
It crushed the [ORG Congress  ] in 2002 in a lop-sided win in the aftermath of the 2002 riots . 
By most accounts , [PER Narendra Modi  ] , the poster boy of anti-Muslim [MISC Hindu  ] nationalist ideology , has an edge to retain his Chief Minister position for a third straight time ( Ref C and H ) . 
The state unit of the [ORG Congress Party  ] is weak and poorly organized. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) If the [ORG Congress Party  ] can put in a healthy performance to make a dent in this [ORG BJP  ] bastion , observers believe the [ORG Congress Party  ] will feel politically strong to risk ( or even call ) a mid-term national poll . 
In this case , the Prime Minister and the [ORG Congress Party  ] would challenge the [ORG Left  ] parties by moving forward with the [ORG IAEA  ] on the safeguards agreement . 
It is because of the importance the [ORG Congress Party  ] attaches to [LOC Gujarat  ] that it is bringing in its top leaders to campaign in the state . 
[PER Sonia Gandhi  ] launched the campaign over the weekend in [LOC Anand  ] , [LOC Gujarat  ] . 
[PER Rahul Gandhi  ] is expected to campaign in the state . 
If , on the other hand , the [ORG Congress Party  ] is trampled again in [LOC Gujarat  ] and fails to improve on its 48 seats ( out of 182 total seats in the assembly ) , it will feel vulnerable and will not be tempted to risk early elections . 
It will then require extraordinary political courage for the [ORG UPA  ] to carry out the [ORG IAEA  ] talks , which place its full term in office in jeopardy . 
Comment: [PER Golda Meir  ] Would be Disgusted -------------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The [ORG Congress Party  ] , led by [PER Sonia Gandhi  ] , has proven especially cautious and nervous in the face of recent extortionist tactics by [PER Prakash Karat  ] . 
With two huge confrontations in its future -- Parliament and [LOC Gujarat  ] -- it will remain true to its cautious form by seeking first to gauge its levels of support before finally being forced -- if absolutely needed -- to take action . 
With the future of [MISC Indian  ] foreign credibility hanging in balance , [PER Sonia Gandhi  ] has been unable to show principled leadership even when it might benefit her party at the polls and reveal [PER Prakash Karat  ] to be the extortionist he is . 
Mrs. [PER Gandhi  ] never misses and opportunity to miss an opportunity . 
While remaining publicly restrained and taking care not to be seen as interfering with domestic [MISC Indian  ] politics , the Embassy will continue to meet with all political , business and civil society organizations to urge them to support the agreement . 
We will continue to press the [ORG UPA  ] government on the need for early completion of the safeguards agreement with the [ORG IAEA  ] . 
And , we will continue our efforts to remind the [ORG BJP  ] that the [MISC US-India  ] civil nuclear agreement is their deal , too .
