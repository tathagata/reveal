Creamer  ] , Charge d'Affaires , DOS , [LOC La Paz  ] ; REASON: 1.4 ( B ) , ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [MISC Summary: Declaring  ] the [LOC Copenhagen  ] [ORG UN  ] climate change summit a failure , [MISC Bolivian  ] President [PER Morales  ] announced he will convoke the first " People 's [ORG World Conference on Climate Change  ] and the [MISC Mother Earth  ] " in [LOC Cochabamba  ] April 20-22 -- coinciding with [MISC Earth Day  ] . 
The conference 's stated objective is to improve the position of social movements in the climate change process and develop an alternative work plan to take to the [ORG United Nations  ] . 
As one of only five countries that did not sign the [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] ( besides [LOC Tuvalu  ] , [LOC Venezuela  ] , [LOC Sudan  ] , and [LOC Cuba  ] ) , the [MISC Bolivian  ] government hopes to raise doubts about the ability of the [ORG UN  ] process to advance the climate change agenda and address the concerns of the world 's poorest nations . 
More fundamentally , [PER Morales  ] views climate change as a vehicle for raising his and [LOC Bolivia  ] 's international political stature , especially among sympathetic anti-globalization groups . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) President [PER Morales  ] seemed to revel in his high-profile opposition to the [ORG UN  ] process at the [LOC Copenhagen  ] summit , ridiculing developed nations' proposals , making extraordinary demands for reparations and aid , and alienating the conference organizers and most delegations . 
[MISC Danish  ] Ambassador to [LOC Bolivia  ] [PER Morten Elkjaer  ] told us [PER Morales  ] canceled most of his bilateral program at the last moment , including meetings with clean energy firms , sustainable energy experts , and leading [MISC Danish  ] businesses and labor federations . 
[MISC Danish  ] Prime Minister [PER Rasmussen  ] spent an unpleasant 30 minutes with [PER Morales  ] , Ambassador [PER Elkjaer  ] said , during which [PER Morales  ] thanked him for bilateral aid ( [LOC Denmark  ] provides [LOC Bolivia  ] approximately $30 million a year in aid ) , but refused to engage on climate change issues . 
The [MISC Danes  ] said they are " fed up " with [LOC Bolivia  ] and the [ORG ALBA  ] countries , who continue to mount legal and propaganda arguments against the [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] , but that they will continue to consult with their [ORG European Union  ] partners on ways to influence the [ORG GOB  ] position. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [MISC Chinese  ] DCM in [LOC La Paz  ] , [PER Huang Yazhong  ] , told the Charge that he has raised the [LOC Copenhagen  ] [ORG Accord  ] twice with [MISC Bolivian  ] [ORG MFA Multilateral Affairs  ] director [PER MarC-a Cecilia ChacC3n  ] , urging the [ORG GOB  ] to rethink its radical opposition to the deal . 
Noting he had made little progress , the [MISC Chinese  ] diplomat suggested that further engagement was pointless and argued that it is up to [LOC Brazil  ] to bring around [LOC Bolivia  ] and the other [ORG ALBA  ] countries . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] officials told us [LOC Bolivia  ] refused to adopt [LOC Brazil  ] 's position on [LOC Copenhagen  ] at a November 26 meeting in [LOC Manaus  ] organized by President [PER Lula da Silva  ] . 
Still , [ORG Itamaraty  ] official [PER Marcel Biato  ] ( and future [MISC Brazilian  ] Ambassador to [LOC La Paz  ] ) said [LOC Brazil  ] will continue to press [LOC Bolivia  ] on [LOC Copenhagen  ] , hoping that [LOC Bolivia  ] 's isolation on this issue will eventually bring it around. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Gisela Ulloa  ] , a member of [MISC Bolivian  ] delegations to earlier COP meetings ( but not [MISC COP-15  ] , where she represented [LOC Papua New Guinea  ] and the [ORG Coalition for First Nations  ] ) told us the [ORG GOB  ] 's position is aimed at creating an alternative development model consistent with [PER Morales  ] 's anti-capitalist philosophy . 
In addition to demanding enormous reparations from developed nations , the [ORG GOB  ] opposes using markets as a mechanism to reduce emissions . 
[PER Ulloa  ] suggested that [PER Morales  ] recognizes [LOC Bolivia  ] will not be included in the deliberations of the major players and is keen to create an alternative forum where he can style himself as the leader of anti-globalization groups and other social movements [ORG MAS  ] Senator [PER Ana Maria Romero  ] added that [PER Morales  ] sees environmental issues as one area where he can carve out an international identity independent from that of his close ally , President [PER Hugo Chavez  ] . 
She recounted to us that an animated [PER Morales  ] told her he was surrounded by well-wishers in [LOC Copenhagen  ] urging him " not to abandon them , " while [PER Chavez  ] was alone in the corner. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Many Bolivians are quick to observe that [PER Morales  ] 's climate change campaign is about enhancing his global stature , not about the environment . 
Former [PER Morales  ] Production Minister and [ORG MAS  ] replacement ( suplente ) Senator [PER Javier Hurtado  ] said there is a huge gap between [MISC Morales'  ] strident , pro-environmental rhetoric in international fora and his domestic emphasis on industrialization as they key to development . 
The foundation of this effort is large-scale natural gas , iron , and lithium production projects , enterprises that have historically proven extremely damaging to the environment . 
In fact , the [ORG Inter-American Development Bank  ] has presented a report to the [ORG GOB  ] that details the serious potential for environmental damage in extracting lithium. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Comment: [LOC Bolivia  ] is already suffering real damage from the effects of global warming , but [PER Morales  ] seems to prefer to score rhetorical points rather than contribute to a solution . 
This radical position won him plaudits from anti-globalization groups , but has alienated many developed nations and most of [LOC Bolivia  ] 's neighbors . . 
Our assessment is that [LOC Bolivia  ] remains beyond reach on [LOC Copenhagen  ] , at least until [PER Morales  ] sees the limits of his approach . 
End comment .
