S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 THE HAGUE 000789 SIPDIS TO THE DEPUTY SECRETARY FROM AMBASSADOR SOBEL E.O. 12958: [LOC DECL:  ] 03/22/2025 TAGS: <a href='/tag/PREL_0.html'>PREL</a> <a href='/tag/PGOV_0.html'>PGOV</a> <a href='/tag/NL_0.html'>NL</a> <a href='/tag/EUN_0.html'>EUN</a> <a href='/tag/NATO_0.html'>NATO</a> SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR DEPUTY SECRETARY ZOELLICK'S APRIL 1 VISIT TO THE [MISC NETHERLANDS Classified  ] By: AMBASSADOR CLIFFORD M. SOBEL FOR REASONS 1.4 ( B ) AND ( D ) . 
Mr. Deputy Secretary: <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) My staff and I are eager to welcome you to the [LOC Netherlands  ] for your first visit here as Deputy Secretary . 
Your trip reinforces the message of transatlantic cooperation delivered by the President and Secretary [PER Rice  ] , and will help focus the [MISC Dutch  ] , in particular , on taking practical steps on the important issues . 
Foreign Minister [PER Bot  ] has time and again demonstrated his keen interest in reinvigorating the transatlantic partnership and its institutions , including [ORG NATO  ] , to face the challenges of the 21st Century . 
Your meetings with him and with a select group of senior opinion makers demonstrates the value we place on [MISC Dutch  ] leadership in this endeavor. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) During the [MISC Dutch  ] presidency of the [ORG EU  ] ( June-December 2004 ) , Foreign Minister [PER Bot  ] pushed the [ORG EU  ] to engage more actively in [LOC Iraq  ] , guided the [ORG EU  ] to set a date for accession negotiations with [LOC Turkey  ] , helped stiffen the [ORG EU  ] 's spine to face down [LOC Russia  ] over [LOC Ukraine  ] , and pressed for increased [MISC U.S.-European  ] cooperation in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
On the [LOC China  ] Arms Embargo , [PER Bot  ] began the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG EU  ] presidency trying to convince us that a lift was inevitable , but ultimately used the authority of the Presidency both to prevent a lift and to ensure that [ORG EU  ] committed itself to no quantitative or qualitative increases in arms sales following a lift . 
[PER Bot  ] , like many [MISC Dutchmen  ] , sees no contradiction between being a strong ally of the [LOC United States  ] and a good [MISC European  ] ; the [LOC China  ] Arms Embargo experience demonstrates his willingness to buck conventional [MISC European  ] wisdom at times to ensure that [LOC U.S.  ] interests are understood and taken into account . 
If anything , his experience during the [ORG EU  ] presidency has only strengthened his basic transatlantic orientation , and he continues to look for ways to use his unique experience ( which includes a decade as [MISC Dutch  ] permrep to the [ORG EU  ] ) and perspective to build bridges across the [LOC Atlantic  ] . 
This was the main reason for his request to meet with Secretary [PER Rice  ] in [LOC Washington  ] prior to the President 's [MISC European  ] trip. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) The [MISC Dutch  ] also deserve credit for promoting [MISC U.S.-EU  ] Counter-Terrorism cooperation during their [ORG EU  ] presidency and for initiating high-level [MISC U.S.-European  ] exchanges of information and intelligence . 
Recent events in the [LOC Netherlands  ] , including the murder of controversial filmmaker [PER Theo van Gogh  ] by a radical [MISC Dutch  ] Islamist and subsequent heightening of tensions here , have sensitized the [MISC Dutch  ] to the fact that [LOC Europe  ] faces a real and present terrorist danger . 
The recent decision to deploy special forces to [LOC Afghanistan  ] in a combat role -- over the objections of the largest opposition party in parliament -- represents a major shift in the way the [MISC Dutch  ] think about their military , and demonstrates the government 's determination to do its part in the global war on terrorism. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) Naturally , the [MISC Dutch  ] and we do not see eye-to-eye on all issues , and you should be prepared for some tough questioning ( in the typically [MISC Dutch  ] blunt style ) on the handling of enemy combatants at [LOC Guantanamo  ] in particular at the roundtable . 
This issue has taken on added importance with the deployment of [MISC Dutch  ] special forces to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
We have responded quickly to [PER Bot  ] 's requests for expert-level consultations -- Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Waxman will be here March 24 to discuss this issue -- but he is under intense pressure from Parliament to demonstrate that [MISC Dutch  ] concerns are being taken seriously . 
I expect he will raise this issue with you , if for no other reason than to be able to tell Parliament honestly that he has done so. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Bot  ] and the [MISC Dutch  ] leadership are still sensitive to criticism that they pulled the [MISC Dutch  ] contingent out of [LOC Al-Muthanna  ] too early ( a judgment we believe [PER Bot  ] personally shares ) . 
The reasons for the decision not to extend the [MISC Dutch  ] deployment for a third time are complicated and grounded in domestic politics . 
[PER Bot  ] led the effort within the cabinet to extend the troops , and has taken pains to ensure that government remains committed to the [MISC Iraqi  ] effort . 
[LOC Iraq  ] . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] were among the first to offer trainers to the [ORG NATO  ] training mission and have let it be known that they can do more -- possibly even including additional future deployments -- provided other allies also step up to the plate . 
In your discussion with [PER Bot  ] , you may want to probe further to see how far the [MISC Dutch  ] are prepared to go at this time and in the future , and to discuss what more the [MISC Dutch  ] can do to leverage additional commitments from other [MISC European  ] partners. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Finally , as an astute observer and participant in inter-European decision making , [PER Bot  ] can be relied on to provide an honest assessment on the current state of play within the [ORG EU  ] on the [LOC China  ] Arms Embargo , where the [MISC Dutch  ] will be happy to join , but not lead , a stalling campaign . 
[PER Bot  ] departs April 4 on a trip to [LOC Asia  ] that will include stops in [LOC Japan  ] and [LOC China  ] , so it will also be useful to arm him with our latest arguments against a lift . 
[PER Bot  ] can also provide useful insights into [ORG EU  ] thinking on [LOC Turkey  ] , where [PER Bot  ] , as a former [MISC Dutch  ] Ambassador to [LOC Ankara  ] , has a proprietary interest in getting both sides successfully to October 3 , and the [LOC Balkans  ] , where the [MISC Dutch  ] remain among the most stalwart supporters of the [ORG ICTY  ] and holding regional governments ( including [LOC Croatia  ] 's ) to account .
