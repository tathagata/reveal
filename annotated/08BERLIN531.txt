07 [LOC BERLIN  ] 0674 Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission [PER John Koenig  ] for Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) ------- Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) The [ORG German Grand Coalition  ] will increasingly face tensions created by the need for the lead candidates to position themselves for the 2009 national electoral campaign . 
Chancellor [PER Angela Merkel  ] and Foreign Minister [PER Frank-Walter Steinmeier  ] both remain highly popular . 
[PER Merkel  ] , however , faces political risks if the economy turns for the worse . 
In the second half of this year , as the [ORG Social Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG SPD  ] ) moves closer to a decision about its chancellor candidate , potential candidate [PER Steinmeier  ] will likely face scrutiny and criticism from his own party 's left-wing . 
It is too early to predict the likely coalition outcome in 2009 -- although [PER Merkel  ] 's [MISC Christian Democrats  ] ( [ORG CDU  ] ) and the [ORG Christian Social Union  ] ( [ORG CSU  ] ) are likely to come out ahead , they may not have a better coalition option than continuing the current [ORG Grand Coalition  ] with the [ORG SPD  ] . 
[LOC U.S.  ] foreign policy is not likely to play a central role in the campaign leading up to [LOC Germany  ] 's national elections in fall 2009 . 
Improved [MISC U.S.-German  ] relations under [PER Merkel  ] and [MISC German  ] fascination with the vibrant democratic process in the [LOC U.S.  ] primary elections have played significant roles in improving [MISC German  ] attitudes towards the [LOC U.S.  ] , thereby dampening the likelihood that the [ORG SPD  ] will use anti-American rhetoric to rally voters as former chancellor [PER Gerhard Schroeder  ] did in 2002 . 
End summary. --------------------------------------------- [PER Merkel  ] 's Possible [PER Archilles Heel:  ] The Economy --------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Chancellor [PER Angela Merkel  ] ( [ORG CDU  ] ) remains highly popular among [MISC Germans  ] , who view her as an effective leader with a strong international stature . 
Her approval rating is 71 percent . 
In large part due to [PER Merkel  ] 's popularity , the [ORG CDU has  ] held a commanding 8- to 14-point lead over the [ORG SPD  ] in polls over the last year. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Although [PER Merkel  ] 's high popularity is expected to continue , she faces diffuse risks on economic issues . 
[ORG CDU parliamentarians  ] suggest that an economic downturn would be the principal threat to [PER Merkel  ] 's high popularity Economic forecasts currently favor [PER Merkel  ] , with projections of 1.6 to 1.8 percent growth for this year ( though slightly lower for 2009 ) , but with no real evidence of recession despite the global slowdown. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Among [ORG CDU  ] leaders there is a sense that the [ORG CDU may  ] have peaked ( perhaps too early ) and that caution is the watchword . 
[PER Merkel  ] , who campaigned in 2005 on a program of economic liberalization and watched a commanding lead in the polls nearly vanish during the campaign , appears to be moving toward the political center in an attempt to expand her base and consolidate centrist support that the [ORG SPD  ] is losing because of its leftward shift . 
She is demonstrating ever-greater focus on domestic policy and espousing popular middle class enticements such as pension increases , a longer duration of unemployment benefits for older workers , and enhancement of nursing care insurance . 
While many consider this move to be politically smart , some on the [ORG CDU 's  ] right-wing have criticized the Chancellor for abandoning core [ORG CDU values.  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- [PER Steinmeier  ] Could Get [MISC Roughed Up  ] by [ORG SPD  ] 's [ORG Left Wing  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [MISC Social Democrats  ] have speculated in recent months that [ORG SPD  ] Chairman [PER Kurt Beck  ] will eventually defer to the much more popular Foreign Minister [PER Frank-Walter Steinmeier  ] as the party 's eventual chancellor candidate ( ref A ) . 
[ORG SPD  ] insiders consider this a 50-50 proposition . 
[PER Kurt Beck  ] 's recent victory in guiding competing factions of the [ORG SPD  ] to agreement on privatization of the railway monopoly [ORG Deutsche Bahn  ] may help shore up his position ( septel ) . 
It is uncertain whether [PER Steinmeier  ] would choose to accept the [ORG SPD  ] nomination at a time when the [ORG SPD  ] is hovering in the mid 20 's in the polls and its electoral prospects seem poor . 
Note: In any case , [PER Steinmeier  ] will run for political office , a federal parliament seat from [LOC Brandenburg City  ] , for the first time in <a id='par2009' href='#par2009'>¶</a>2009 . 
End note. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Steinmeier  ] would face some detractors in his own [LOC BERLIN  ] 00000531 002 OF 002 party . 
Deputy [ORG SPD Chair  ] [PER Andrea Nahles  ] , the leading left-wing critic of [PER Steinmeier  ] 's centrist approach , told Political M/C that she was unhappy that " the [LOC U.S.  ] knows more about [PER Steinmeier  ] than I do , " referring to [PER Steinmeier  ] 's role as Chancellery Chief of Staff and Intelligence Coordinator under [PER Gerhard Schroeder  ] . 
[PER Nahles  ] suggested strongly that the left wing of the [ORG SPD  ] could portray [PER Steinmeier  ] as too close to the [LOC U.S.  ] on intelligence-related issues , especially his role in the [PER Murat Kurnaz  ] affair ( ref B ) , thereby damaging his candidacy. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Nahles  ] admitted , however , that the [ORG SPD  ] likely would do better at the polls with [PER Steinmeier  ] as chancellor candidate ( between 30 and 35 percent of the vote ) . 
This would mean more [ORG SPD  ] parliamentarians holding onto their seats -- a consideration that could have an effect on the [ORG SPD  ] 's choice . 
[PER Nahles  ] added that [PER Steinmeier  ] " has little experience in managing the party , but he 's a fast learner . 
" ---------------------------------- [ORG Grand Coalition Fated to Continue  ] ? ---------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Deputy [ORG CDU  ] national chairman and [LOC Lower Saxony  ] Minister-President [PER Christian Wulff  ] ( [ORG CDU  ] ) told the [ORG DCM  ] that another grand coalition is the most likely outcome in 2009 if the political landscape does not change significantly in the coming months . 
The [ORG SPD  ] 's [PER Nahles  ] agrees . 
While [PER Merkel  ] and the [ORG CDU  ] still prefer to govern with the [MISC Free Democrats  ] ( [ORG FDP  ] ) , the numbers may not suffice for a majority . 
Although experiments such as the [MISC CDU-Greens  ] coalition in [LOC Hamburg  ] are enticing , replicating them at the national level remains difficult. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [ORG Comment:  ] The [ORG CDU  ] 's fear of opening up its flanks to [ORG SPD  ] attacks -- and the [ORG SPD  ] 's self-obsession during a period of turmoil in the party -- reveal a degree of caution on policy issues that is remarkable even by [MISC German  ] standards . 
This is reflected in [MISC German  ] caution on foreign policy issues of interest to us such as [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Iran  ] . 
A particular USG concern is whether the [ORG SPD  ] or others will try to employ anti-American rhetoric to curry voter support , much as former chancellor [PER Gerhard Schroeder  ] did in 2002 . 
Even [ORG SPD  ] left-wingers like [PER Nahles  ] tell us , however , that foreign policy is not as great a consideration for [MISC German  ] voters as it was around the time of the [LOC Iraq  ] war , and therefore will not likely be a decisive factor in next year 's national elections . 
It is also important to note that [MISC German  ] attitudes towards the [LOC U.S.  ] have improved over the past year due to our improved bilateral relations and [MISC German  ] fascination with democracy on display in the [LOC U.S.  ] primary elections . 
The current improvement is evidenced by a recent [MISC Harris  ] poll which showed a dramatic 21 percentage-point increase in the number of [MISC Germans  ] who regard the [LOC U.S.  ] as a trustworthy partner . 
Also , the [MISC German  ] federal election campaign will occur during what is expected here to be an extended popular " honeymoon " for the new [LOC U.S.  ] administration . 
Consequently , [MISC German  ] politicians might perceive less political advantage in a critical stance toward the [LOC U.S.  ] End comment .
