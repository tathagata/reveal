WARSAW 360 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Victor Ashe  ] for Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) SUMMARY: Embassy Warsaw believes there would be a strong , negative [MISC Polish  ] reaction to major [LOC U.S.  ] force reductions in [LOC Europe  ] . 
From [LOC Poland  ] , s perspective , a big drawdown would be seen as evidence that the [LOC U.S.  ] is less committed to [MISC European  ] security at a time of heightened concern over the intentions of a resurgent [LOC Russia  ] . 
[MISC Polish  ] officials have emphasized the need for [ORG NATO  ] to bolster its military capabilities to avoid becoming a political club more than a military alliance . 
They are adamant about revising [ORG NATO  ] , s [ORG Strategic Concept  ] to restore the balance between external missions and territorial defense ; they will strongly protest a reduction in the resources needed for that defense . 
The [MISC Poles  ] tell us that it would be hard to justify continued sacrifices in missions like [ORG ISAF  ] if cooperation with the [MISC Alliance  ] is a one-way street , and the [LOC U.S.  ] and other Allies do not take [MISC Polish  ] security concerns into account . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) The [MISC Poles  ] believe they have an implicit understanding with the [LOC United States  ] and the [MISC Alliance:  ] they will take active part in missions far from their borders , particularly in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , provided that the [MISC Alliance  ] makes adequate provisions for the defense of [LOC Poland  ] , s borders . 
[LOC Poland  ] is [ORG ISAF  ] , s seventh leading troop contributor , fighting without caveats in [LOC Southern Afghanistan  ] , and Foreign Minister [PER Sikorski  ] told us recently that he is pressing Prime Minister Tusk to approve another troop increase , from 2,000 to 3,000 soldiers . 
Some analysts have told us ( Ref C ) that the greatest threat to [MISC Polish  ] resolve in [LOC Afghanistan  ] would not be increased casualties , but a failure by the [MISC Alliance  ] to address [LOC Poland  ] , s concerns about [LOC Europe  ] , s territorial defense . 
[LOC Poland  ] would see [LOC U.S.  ] troop cuts as compounding shortfalls in the resources and political will needed to defend [MISC Europe.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) Unlike the previous [MISC Polish  ] government , the Tusk government is not reflexively [MISC Russophobic  ] , but [MISC Polish  ] officials remain concerned about a resurgent [LOC Russia  ] . 
The GoP took the lead in marshalling an EU reaction to [LOC Russia  ] , s invasion of [LOC Georgia  ] , and faulted the [LOC U.S.  ] , among others , for doing too little , too late . 
In a speech at the [LOC Atlantic Council  ] last year , the Foreign Minister launched the &Sikorski doctrine8: the [LOC West  ] must respond adequately the next time [LOC Russia  ] tries to change [LOC Europe  ] , s borders by force. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) Foreign Minister [PER Sikorski  ] has told [LOC U.S.  ] leaders emphatically that [ORG NATO  ] risks becoming a political club more than a military alliance ) he believes it needs to change the politically correct threat assessments ( particularly those concerning [LOC Russia  ] ) , and put in place substantial contingency planning and exercises . 
During bilateral talks with the [LOC U.S.  ] on [LOC Missile Defense  ] , the [MISC Poles  ] implied that the [MISC Alliance  ] , s [ORG Article V  ] guarantees may not be dependable , and pressed for bilateral [LOC U.S.  ] security guarantees . 
As [ORG NATO  ] launches the process of revising [ORG NATO  ] , s [ORG Strategic Concept  ] , the [MISC Poles  ] are pushing hard to restore balance between out-of-area operations and territorial defense . 
[MISC Polish  ] officials have hinted at how strong the reaction would be if their concerns are not addressed in the new [ORG Strategic Concept  ] ; the reaction would doubtless be even stronger if they perceived strategic guidance as undercut by [LOC U.S.  ] force reductions. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) [LOC Poland  ] would see significant [LOC U.S.  ] force reductions in [LOC Europe  ] as the latest in a series of disappointments with the [LOC U.S.:  ] in their view , the [LOC U.S.  ] failed to deliver promised [MISC Iraqi  ] contracts , to bring a loyal Ally into the [ORG Visa Waiver Program  ] , and most recently , to appoint an appropriately high-level presidential delegation to the September 1 commemoration in [LOC Gdansk  ] of the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of [MISC World War II  ] . 
Many [MISC Poles  ] see this as part of a broader regional trend , a downgrading of [LOC U.S.  ] interest in [MISC Central  ] and [ORG Eastern Europe  ] . 
Three [MISC Polish  ] statesmen , [PER Lech Walesa  ] , [PER Aleksander Kwasniewski  ] and [PER Adam Daniel Rotfeld  ] , were among the signatories of the July letter from [MISC Central European  ] leaders to President [PER Obama  ] . 
The letter warned that the region , s stability and Atlanticist outlook cannot be taken for granted in the face of allegedly waning [LOC U.S.  ] engagement .
