[LOC BERLIN  ] 138 <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
[LOC BERLIN  ] 112 Classified By: AMBASSADOR PHILIP [PER D. MURPHY  ] . 
REASONS: 1.4 ( B ) AND ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY . 
Defense Minister [PER zu Guttenberg  ] revealed in a February 3 meeting with Ambassador [PER Murphy  ] that coalition partner FM [PER Westerwelle  ] -- not the opposition [ORG Social Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG SPD  ] ) -- had been the single biggest obstacle to the government seeking a bigger increase in [MISC German  ] troops for [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
But even with the modest planned troop increase of 500 ( with 350 more in reserve ) , zu [PER Guttenberg  ] said a restructuring of the current Bundeswehr presence would allow [LOC Germany  ] to increase the number of soldiers involved in the training of [ORG Afghan National Army  ] ( [ORG ANA  ] ) by more than 1,000 . 
While [PER Westerwelle  ] has portrayed his skepticism about additional troops as principled , it was also motivated by a desire to put zu [PER Guttenberg  ] " in his place . 
" While the size of the troop increase is settled , the length of the new [MISC ISAF  ] mandate remains open . 
The government is hoping to have the new mandate approved by the [ORG Bundestag  ] before the end of February , with significant ( if not majority ) support from the opposition [ORG SPD  ] and [ORG Greens  ] . 
END SUMMARY . 
WESTERWELLE: BIGGEST OBSTACLE <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In explaining the lower-than-expected planned increase in the number of [MISC German  ] troops for [LOC Afghanistan  ] , zu [PER Guttenberg  ] told the Ambassador that [PER Westerwelle  ] 's opening position in the coalition negotiations on the new mandate had been " not one additional soldier . 
" In that context , it had been difficult to get agreement on any increase at all . 
( Comment: [PER Zu Guttenberg  ] proposed 1,500 additional troops at the initial January 4 mini-cabinet meeting on this issue . 
End Comment . 
) DOING A LOT MORE WITH A LITTLE MORE <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) To help justify the need for more troops , zu [PER Guttenberg  ] said he had forced the Bundeswehr to do a complete review of all the existing positions in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , which had confirmed that some could be eliminated in light of the new [MISC ISAF  ] counterinsurgency strategy . 
He said a restructuring of the current Bundeswehr presence , combined with the troop increase , would boost the number of soldiers involved in the training of the [ORG Afghan National Army  ] ( [ORG ANA  ] ) from 280 to 1,400 . 
The restructuring includes turning the battalion-size quick reaction force based in [LOC Mazar  ] into a " protection and training " battalion . 
A second such battalion will be created in [LOC Kunduz  ] by augmenting the existing infantry company there with new troops . 
[PER Zu Guttenberg  ] reiterated that [LOC Germany  ] strongly supports [ORG COMISAF  ] 's focus on protection of the population and partnering with the [MISC Afghan  ] national security forces ( [ORG ANSF  ] ) , and that the [MISC German  ] " trainers " ( i.e. , the two new maneuver battalions ) will operate in the field with the [ORG ANSF  ] . 
PUTTING ZU [PER GUTTENBERG  ] IN HIS PLACE <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) While zu [PER Guttenberg  ] said he is avoiding public comment on whether the outcome of the coalition talks on the new mandate is a " victory " for him or [PER Westerwelle  ] , [ORG FDP Defense Policy  ] Spokesman [PER Elke Hoff  ] told poloff separately that [PER Westerwelle  ] 's hard line against additional troops had been motivated in part to " teach zu [PER Guttenberg  ] a lesson . 
" She claimed that zu [PER Guttenberg  ] had been too presumptuous last fall in making speeches in [LOC Canada  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] about how [LOC Germany  ] would significantly increase its troop contribution to [MISC ISAF  ] . 
He might have been able to get agreement on a higher ceiling had he engaged parliamentarians first and showed " greater respect for the political process . 
" OPEN QUESTION: LENGTH OF THE MANDATE <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Zu Guttenberg  ] confirmed that the cabinet would formally agree on the proposed new [MISC ISAF  ] mandate February 9 and that the first reading in the [ORG Bundestag  ] would be February 10 . 
FM [PER Westerwelle  ] is scheduled to speak on behalf of the government in introducing the proposed mandate . 
The government is aiming to hold the final [ORG Bundestag  ] vote on the mandate -- following two weeks of committee hearings -- on February 26 . 
[PER Zu Guttenberg  ] was [LOC BERLIN  ] 00000157 002 OF 002 confident that a large number ( if not a majority ) of opposition politicians from the [ORG SPD  ] and [ORG Greens  ] would vote in favor of the new mandate. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) A February 2 meeting of state secretaries tentatively agreed that the new mandate should run , as is the custom , for one year , expiring in February 2011 . 
[PER Zu Guttenberg  ] indicated , however , that it might be preferable to stick to the length of the current mandate , which expires in December 2010 . 
He expressed concern that having the mandate lap over into early 2011 could lead to a premature debate on withdrawal , before the new strategy really had a chance to work . 
( Comment: Another option under consideration -- and favored by some in the [LOC Chancellery  ] -- is a 18-month mandate , so that any debate on the future of the troop presence would be put off until the fall of <a id='par2011' href='#par2011'>¶</a>2011 . 
But the [MISC MFA  ] objects that this would only raise the ire of the opposition and give them an excuse to oppose the mandate . 
End Comment . 
) REASSURING THE GERMANS ON COMMAND OF THE NORTH <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Zu Guttenberg  ] confirmed that [LOC Germany  ] very much welcomed the planned inflow of [LOC U.S.  ] forces into the north , especially the helicopter assets , which filled a long-standing shortfall . 
He noted , however , that many in [LOC Germany  ] question whether the [LOC U.S.  ] will be willing to accept continued [MISC German  ] leadership of [LOC RC-North  ] in view of the increased [LOC U.S.  ] presence . 
Ambassador [PER Murphy  ] assured him that the [LOC U.S.  ] had no issues working for the [MISC German  ] command in the [LOC North  ] .
