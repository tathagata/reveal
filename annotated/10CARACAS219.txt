( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: In separate meetings with the Ambassador between February 17-19 , several of [LOC Venezuela  ] 's major private media [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] acknowledged that relentless [MISC Venezuelan  ] Government ( [ORG GBRV  ] ) pressure against their television and print outlets has threatened to put them out of business . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , confirmed the allegations of [ORG Globovision  ] 's outgoing director , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , that threats from senior [ORG GBRV  ] officials had forced them to fire [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and to tone down [ORG Globovision  ] 's strongly anti-Chavez orientation . 
In a separate conversation , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] asserted that due to the paper 's substantial loss of advertising revenue from companies that had either been nationalized or been threatened by the [ORG GBRV  ] , the paper would go out of business by April without substantial financial assistance . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] asked the Ambassador whether the [LOC U.S.  ] could provide such assistance . 
End Summary. --------------------------------------------- ---------------------- -------- [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] Resigns ; Alleges [ORG GBRV  ] Pressure on [ORG Globovision Owners  ] --------------------------------------------- ---------------------- -------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( SBU ) Following more than a week of widespread speculation regarding the potential sale of opposition-oriented television network [ORG Globovision  ] ( Ref A ) , station director [PER Alberto  ] [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] announced his resignation during a February 18 press conference . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , who is also a minor shareholder in the station , alleged to reporters that Energy Minister [PER Ali Rodriguez  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] 's [ORG Central Bank  ] President [PER Nelson Merentes  ] had pressured the station 's principal shareholders , [ORG Globovision  ] President [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [ORG Banco Federal  ] President [PER Nelson XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , to sack [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , to get rid of controversial anti-Chavez talk show host [PER Leopoldo Castillo  ] , and to soften the station 's strongly anti-Chavez orientation . 
In resigning , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] affirmed: " For now my objectives have been met . 
The channel has not been sold , [PER Leopoldo Castillo  ] is still on the air , and [ORG Globovision  ] will not change its editorial line . 
" He added , " I have absolute faith in [ORG Globovision  ] and [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that they will not modify their editorial stance . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In a private meeting on February 17 , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told the Ambassador that [ORG GBRV  ] pressure on [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] involved trumped up legal charges stemming from a May 21 , 2009 , raid on [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] 's [LOC Caracas  ] residence . 
The raid had resulted in the confiscation of 24 new vehicles and hunting trophies ( Ref B ) , criminal charges against [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and his son , and an order preventing [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] 's departure from the country . 
( Note: [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] has consistently claimed the automobiles belonged to his car dealership and were at his home for security reasons , and that the hunting trophies had been legally acquired abroad . 
End Note . 
) According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , the February 12 lifting of [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] 's overseas travel ban by the [ORG GBRV  ] was a bargaining chip used against [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] to force his acquiescence . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] opined that the pressure point applied by the government against [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was ultimately his son: " [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] would do anything to keep him safe . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] affirmed to the Ambassador that [PER Nelson  ] [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] had been under similarly intense [ORG GBRV  ] pressure to engineer a change in [ORG Globovision  ] 's management and editorial line . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] claimed that [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] had been threatened by Energy Minister ( and previously Finance Minister ) [PER Rodriguez  ] that if [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] did not comply with [ORG GBRV  ] demands , " we will go after your bank . 
" [LOC CARACAS  ] 00000219 002 OF 003 --------------------------------------------- ---------- [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXConfirm Capitulation  ] --------------------------------------------- ---------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In a February 18 meeting with the Ambassador , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] largely confirmed [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] 's account . 
Following various [ORG GBRV  ] threats , some even from [PER Chavez  ] himself in the past , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] claimed that Minister [PER Rodriguez  ] had attempted to pressure [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] into buying out [ORG Globovision  ] shareholders [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , firing [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , and getting rid of [PER Leopoldo Castillo  ] , to forestall the [ORG GBRV  ] withdrawing millions of dollars in deposits from [ORG Banco Federal  ] ; [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] added that he " had practically been forced to sell the bank . 
" XXXXXXXXXXXXtold the Ambassador the [ORG GBRV  ] strategy was for [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] to buy [ORG Globovision  ] for nearly 32 million dollars and for [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] to " leave quietly... to work on expanding [ORG Globovision  ] from abroad . 
" [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] further agreed to " Send [PER Leopoldo Castillo  ] away for a while... first class tickets for two weeks in [LOC Australia  ] . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Despite [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] 's pronouncements at his press conference that [ORG Globovision  ] would not self-censor despite the [ORG GBRV  ] pressure , XXXXXXXXXXXXadmitted they were being forced to soften the station 's future editorial line . 
XXXXXXXXXXXXobserved that " this arrangement has bought us some time . 
[ORG Globo  ] will continue on , however we will not use the screen to scare people . 
We will report on the problems in an objective , independent manner... we will , however , most likely refrain from naming names . 
" When asked why the Government had allowed the station to operate for so long , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] replied , " The Government needs to leave a small window open to pretend there is freedom of expression here . 
" [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] added , " [ORG Globovision  ] is [PER Chavez  ] 's 'Carta de [MISC Libertdad  ] de Expression' ( " free speech credential " ) ... he can say , 'look here is [ORG Globovision  ] , see , we are a democracy' . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told the Ambassador that the station is financially independent and healthy despite the [ORG GBRV  ] 's recent attacks , increased lawyer 's fees , and continual legal harassment . 
( Note: [ORG Globovision  ] currently confronts civil and criminal charges stemming from six separate [ORG GBRV  ] investigations . 
End Note . 
) In reflecting on his decision to bend to the [ORG GBRV  ] 's will , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted " I have over 13,000 employees , plus the bank , to care for . 
" Looking towards the September [ORG National Assembly  ] elections , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] predicted: " If [PER Chavez  ] wins , we are all gone . 
Our next meeting will have to be in [LOC Boca Raton..  ] . 
Buying time before the election is the name of the game . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] --------------------------------------------- ---- Major Newspaper Taking Its Last Gasps ? --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In a separate February 19 meeting , Ambassador [PER Duddy  ] met with [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
Lamenting the [ORG GBRV  ] 's " economic asphyxiation " of [ORG El Nacional  ] and the independent media generally , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told the Ambassador that [ORG El Nacional  ] was reaching the end of its financial rope . 
Due to plummeting advertising revenue that stemmed from the loss of advertising partners that had either been nationalized or been otherwise intimidated by the [ORG GBRV  ] to cease such advertising , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] predicted that [ORG El Nacional  ] could [LOC CARACAS  ] 00000219 003 OF 003 be out of money and thus business by April . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] affirmed that fellow independent daily [ORG El Universal  ] was also having severe financial difficulties , and for similar reasons . 
( Note: In his February 18 meeting with the Ambassador , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] had highlighted that [ORG El Universal  ] had lost over 14% of its advertising revenues just with the recent nationalization of supermarket chain [ORG Exito  ] . 
End Note . 
) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] commented , " [ORG Globovision  ] has now been lost . 
We will be the next to go . 
" <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that increased [ORG GBRV  ] nationalizations would further reduce already limited commercial space/advertising revenue , and limit the independent media 's space to maneuver in the months ahead . 
To keep [ORG El Nacional  ] alive , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] asked the Ambassador whether the [MISC Embassy  ] knew of services of private financing they could approach outside the country , or failing that , if the [ORG USG  ] could be persuaded to help . 
( Note: The Ambassador noted that investors and financial institutions in the [LOC U.S.  ] were increasingly anxious about expansion in [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
He also noted that he had never heard of the [ORG USG  ] underwriting a newspaper even , for instance , during the difficult period in the early 80 's in [PER Pinochet  ] 's [LOC Chile  ] . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Chavez  ] continues to reduce the private media 's ability to serve as a countervailing democratic force . 
With [ORG Globovision  ] executives softening their tone , counting their remaining days , and major print media in apparently dire financial conditions , [PER Chavez  ] is close to his goal of " domesticating " or eliminating the remaining free and independent media in [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
End Comment .
