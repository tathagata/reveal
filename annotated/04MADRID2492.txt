[LOC MADRID  ] 2315 Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission [PER J. Robert Manzanares  ] , reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] The previous [MISC Spanish  ] government under President [PER Jose Maria Aznar  ] was long in the forefront within the [ORG EU  ] and on its own in criticizing [MISC Cuban  ] human rights abuses , lack of movement toward democracy and absence of fundamental rights for [MISC Cuban  ] citizens . 
The current government under Socialist President [PER Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero  ] , who took office in mid-April this year , has not softened [LOC Spain  ] 's position on [LOC Cuba  ] but neither has it overtly continued [PER Aznar  ] 's strident criticism . 
The past six months saw a continuation of [LOC Spain  ] 's actions and policies advocating a tough stance against the [MISC Castro  ] regime . 
Although it is difficult to predict [PER Zapatero  ] 's policies and actions toward [LOC Cuba  ] , the absence of a [ORG Title III  ] suspension might encourage the [ORG GOS  ] to soften its position on [LOC Cuba  ] both bilaterally and within the [ORG EU  ] . 
Moreover , [LOC Spain  ] would likely claim the [LOC U.S.  ] has violated the common understanding reached with the [ORG EU  ] concerning the [ORG Libertad Act  ] ( the [ORG Act  ] ) in May 2000 . 
End summary. ----------------------------- [LOC SPAIN  ] TOWARD [LOC CUBA  ] UNDER [ORG AZNAR  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Embassy provides this review of [LOC Spain  ] 's recent [LOC Cuba  ] policy in response to ref [PER A. Jose Maria Aznar  ] 's government was a strident critic of the [MISC Castro  ] regime practically until the day [PER Aznar  ] departed office in mid-April 2004 . 
[PER Aznar  ] was a prime force behind the hardening of the [ORG EU  ] 's position on [LOC Cuba  ] after the [MISC Castro  ] regime arrested more than 70 dissidents in March 2003 . 
In June 2003 , the [ORG EU  ] announced that as a result of the arrest and sentencing of these dissidents , it would encourage member states to limit bilateral high-level government visits , reduce their participation in cultural events , and invite [MISC Cuban  ] dissidents to national day celebrations . 
The [ORG EU  ] also threatened to re-examine the [ORG EU  ] 's common position on [LOC Cuba  ] . 
The [ORG Aznar  ] government pushed hard for these measures and firmly supported them from the time the measures were announced until it handed over power to the Socialists in April . 
The [ORG Aznar  ] government condemned the [MISC Castro  ] regime multiple times in that period for its human rights abuses , lack of democratic reforms and failure to guarantee fundamental rights for its citizens . 
As a result of [LOC Spain  ] 's hard line , the [MISC Castro  ] regime shut down [LOC Spain  ] 's binational cultural center in [LOC Havana.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In addition , at the [ORG USG  ] 's urging , the [ORG Aznar  ] government in April 2004 pressed [LOC Honduras  ] to sponsor this year 's [ORG UNCHR  ] resolution on [LOC Cuba  ] . 
[LOC Honduras  ] eventually did sponsor the resolution ( after considerable reluctance ) . 
The [ORG Aznar  ] government was also a key player in the [ORG EU  ] 's eventual decision to oppose [LOC Cotonou  ] membership for [LOC Cuba  ] , forcing the [MISC Castro  ] regime to withdraw its application . 
In sum , the [ORG Aznar  ] government did much to advance democracy , human rights and fundamental freedoms in [LOC Cuba  ] while it was in power. --------------------------------------------- -- [ORG ZAPATERO GOVERNMENT'S APPROACH  ] TO [MISC CASTRO  ] REGIME --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Since taking office in mid-April , the [PER Zapatero  ] government has not taken any actions or announced policy modifications that change [LOC Spain  ] 's [LOC Cuba  ] policy as it existed under [ORG Aznar  ] . 
As Embassy has previously reported ( ref B ) , [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] officials have told us [LOC Spain  ] will maintain its tough stance on [LOC Cuba  ] , saying [MISC Castro  ] has done nothing to merit softening of the strong stand [LOC Spain  ] and the [ORG EU  ] have taken against the regime 's human rights violations and refusal to allow democratic reforms . 
The officials have said , however , that the [ORG GOS  ] would prefer to tone down the rhetoric that went back and forth between [MISC Castro  ] and [PER Aznar  ] , and if possible , return to some form of dialogue with [LOC Cuba  ] . 
In the end , given [LOC Cuba  ] 's intransigence , they viewed this as highly unlikely . 
They have also said they do not plan to take the same leadership role [ORG Aznar  ] did on [LOC Cuba  ] within the [ORG EU  ] and would opt to be minimally involved in formulating or influencing [ORG EU  ] policy on [LOC Cuba.  ] --------------------------------------------- --------- IMPACT ON COOPERATION WITH [LOC SPAIN  ] IF WAIVER NOT RENEWED --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOS  ] , like the [ORG EU  ] , has always bristled at the [ORG Act  ] as a piece of extraterritorial legislation which is probably contrary to the [ORG WTO  ] and represents the imposition of [LOC U.S.  ] foreign policy on its friends and allies . 
[LOC Spain  ] is also bound by [ORG EU  ] and subsequent [MISC Spanish  ] implementing legislation forbidding nationals or companies from cooperating with foreign legislation such as that embodied in the [ORG Act  ] . 
Companies or nationals that do cooperate with foreign governments to implement such measures will be prosecuted and fined under [MISC Spanish  ] law , and the [ORG GOS  ] will be obliged to report these events to the [ORG EU  ] . 
[LOC Spain  ] presumes the [LOC U.S.  ] is still acting under the May 2000 understanding with the [ORG EU  ] concerning enforcement of the [ORG Act  ] and pursuit of a waiver. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Despite [LOC Spain  ] 's opposition to the [ORG Act  ] , the attitude of the [ORG Aznar  ] government toward the [MISC Castro  ] regime was the closest to ours of any [MISC Spanish  ] government previously and one of the closest , if not the closest , of any of our allies that have ties to [LOC Cuba  ] . 
While the [ORG Zapatero  ] government may not be as openly critical of [LOC Cuba  ] as was its predecessor , it has taken no action to soften [ORG Aznar  ] 's hard line . 
Were the waiver not renewed , we expect the [ORG Zapatero  ] government to contend the [MISC EU-U.S.  ] understanding on the [ORG Act  ] had been broken . 
Non-waiver would also give the [ORG GOS  ] cover to seek normalization of dialogue with [LOC Cuba  ] , whatever that would entail . 
Given [LOC Spain  ] 's long-standing hard line against [LOC Cuba  ] and the fact that by all appearances the [ORG Zapatero  ] government plans to continue that hard line ( even if it does not plan to be as critical as [ORG Aznar  ] ) , the [ORG USG  ] would have little to gain and much to lose in achieving its foreign policy goals by not renewing the waiver .
