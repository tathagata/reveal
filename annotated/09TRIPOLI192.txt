Cretz  ] , Ambassador , [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy - [LOC Tripoli  ] , [LOC U.S.  ] Dept of State . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: Ordinary [MISC Libyans  ] , frustrated by privations during the country 's isolation under sanctions and exhausted by decades of largely failed political adventurism under the rubric of [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi 's al-Fateh Revolution , appear to care more about economic reform than political change . 
Historically entrepeneurial , al-Qadhafi 's revolution had been a " poor fit " for most [MISC Libyans  ] . 
The lifting of sanctions and nascent economic reforms were a welcome relief ; however , the increasing disparity between what [MISC Libyans  ] saw and wanted to buy and what they could afford ( the majority are still employed by the government ) has remained a problem . 
Static state salaries and inflation , particularly with respect to prices for food and key staples , have hit ordinary [MISC Libyans  ] hard in the last two years . 
The tendency of greedy regime elites to monopolize the most lucrative market sectors has had political consequences , and the pervasive culture of rent-seeking that evolved during the sanctions period , together with conspicuous consumption by regime elites , has not sat well with the silent majority of [MISC Libyans  ] , who remain socially conservative . 
The fact that many young men are forced by lack of means to delay marriage is another pressing economic issue in a conservative society in which marriage is a key social anchor and indicator of status . 
Embassy contacts in [LOC Tripoli  ] , [LOC Benghazi  ] and [LOC Tobruk  ] were cautiously optimistic about proposals for wealth distribution and continued economic reform , but less sanguine about proposed government re-structuring and political change . 
Despite talk of a possible constitution and perhaps even elections , [MISC Libyans  ] are mostly sober-minded about the prospect and likely pace of political change , at least while [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi remains alive and in control . 
But they are cautiously optimistic that the limited economic reforms that have been undertaken to date will continue , and that their salaries will somehow increase enough to allow them to enjoy more of the consumer goods that they were largely deprived of for more than 20 years . 
End summary . 
[MISC LIBYANS  ] CARE MORE ABOUT ECONOMIC REFORM THAN POLITICAL CHANGE 2 . 
( C ) As reported ref A , [LOC Libya  ] appears to be in one of its intermittent periods of intense political foment . 
As debate in the externally-based opposition press and [LOC Libya  ] 's small indigenous elite swirls around proposed wealth distribution , government re-structuring , possible adoption of a constitution and the ostensible withdrawal from politics by presumed heir-apparent [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi , ordinary [MISC Libyans  ] have largely eschewed politics and remained primarily focused on improving their daily standard of living. xxxxxxxxxxxx recently told P/E Chief that ordinary [MISC Libyans  ] had been frustrated by years of sanctions-imposed privations and , more recently , by the disparity between increased availability of consumer goods and their stagnant salaries . 
Exhausted by years of largely failed political adventurism under the auspices of [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi 's al-Fateh Revolution and the [LOC Jamahiriya  ] ( state of the masses ) , most [MISC Libyans  ] do not really care about politics or political reform . 
" Do not give us free speech , parties , a constitution or elections - give us the ability to make and freely spend money " , he said . 
REVOLUTION A " POOR FIT " FOR HISTORICALLY ENTREPENEURIAL [MISC LIBYANS  ] 3 . 
( C ) In a conservative society dominated by tribes , [MISC Libyans  ] are primarily focused on providing for their families . 
Drawing an analogy with [LOC Russia  ] , xxxxxxxxxxxx said that [MISC Libyans  ] would remain politically quiescent as long as economic conditions were " acceptable " , but cautioned that " poverty is real " in [LOC Libya  ] and that maintaining the perception of an improved daily quality of life for people was a serious political imperative for [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi 's regime . 
( Note: Despite the country 's oil wealth , some internal government reports reportedly suggest that as many as a third of [LOC Libya  ] 's estimated one million families live at or below the poverty line . 
End note . 
) Laughingly referring to the [LOC Barbary  ] corsairs , xxxxxxxxxxxx noted that [MISC Libyans  ] were historically entrepeneurial and characterized the period of revolutionary zeal in [LOC Libya  ] between the late 1970 's and early 1990 's as a " poor fit " for them . 
Masters of tactical maneuvering and operating with tight margins , xxxxxxxxxxxx said [MISC Libyan  ] businessmen only needed a small window in which to flourish- the recent relaxation of rules still on the books prohibiting private ownership and governing profits had been enough to prompt a flood of consumer goods by comparison with what had been on offer only four or five years ago . 
DISPARITY BETWEEN INCREASED CONSUMER PRODUCTS ON OFFER AND STATIC SALARIES 4 . 
( C ) A significant danger , though , was the increasing disparity between what [MISC Libyans  ] saw and wanted to buy and what they could afford . 
The combination of static state salaries and inflation , particularly with respect to prices for food and key staples ( ref B ) , have hit ordinary [MISC Libyan  ] families hard in the last two years . 
( Note: More than 60 percent of [LOC Libya  ] 's workforce are public sector employees with salaries that have not changed in years , and some 250,000 of them draw salaries but do not work , according to the minister-equivalent for Manpower , Employment and Training . 
Overall inflation for 2007 was 6.3 percent and 12 percent for 2008 ; foodstuffs , beverages and tobacco increased by 16.4 percent . 
End note . 
) The tendency of avaricious regime elites to monopolize the most lucrative market sectors ( ref C ) was another economic risk with attendant political consequences . 
( Note: [ORG Transparency International  ] 's 2008 [MISC Corruption Perceptions Index  ] put [LOC Libya  ] at 126 among the 180 countries it rated . 
As a point of reference , [LOC Nigeria  ] ranked 121st . 
End note . 
) The pervasive culture of rent-seeking that had flourished during the lean sanctions period , together with the ostentatious consumerism of the regime elite , did not sit well with the silent majority of [MISC Libyans  ] , most of whom remained conservative . 
SOCIAL IMPACT OF ECONOMIC PROBLEMS A COMPLICATION IN A SOCIALLY CONSERVATIVE SOCIETY 5 . 
( C ) Comments by xxxxxxxxxxxx echo xxxxxxxxxxxx 's analysis . 
The owner of xxxxxxxxxxxx suffers from rheumatism-related medical complaints for which treatment is unavailable in [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
He must travel regularly to [LOC Tunis  ] for costly treatment , a signficant expense . 
Neither of his two adult sons - both in their late 20 's - has full-time work . 
One is married ; the other is not. xxxxxxxxxxxx 's small pension from a former government job and modest income from the store support him , his wife , their younger daughters ( who are school-aged ) and his adult sons . 
Although they believe him to be too anxious to appease western countries and too glib , xxxxxxxxxxxx and xxxxxxxxxxxx have expressed support for [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi and his proposed political and economic reforms ; however , they readily concede that they would be willing to forego political reform in exchange for more income and greater stability in terms of services provided by the state . 
They , like many other middle and lower-class [MISC Libyans  ] , fear that proposed government re-structuring , which would include dismantling many existing ministry-equivalents ( including those for health and education ) , would mean a lesser quality of life in at least the near to mid-term . 
While they are intrigued by the proposal to distribute oil wealth directly to [MISC Libyan  ] citizens , they have little expectation that such will actually occur . 
If it were to happen , many believe that the proposed stipends would not be sufficient to defray the costs of paying for services like education and health care , which would be privatized . 
6 . 
( C ) The owner of xxxxxxxxxxxx in the eastern city of [LOC Benghazi  ] shares those concerns about proposed privatization , but is willing to give it a try if the government would actually reduce its role in the lives of ordinary [MISC Libyans  ] . 
Paraphrasing [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi 's remarks about the [LOC U.S.  ] during his Revolution Day speech last August ( ref D ) , our contact said he wanted the government " ... to be neither friend nor enemy , but merely to leave us alone " . 
Noting that [MISC Libyans  ] , particularly those in eastern [MISC Libyan  ] , had a long history as successful traders and highlighting the failure of the [LOC Jamahiriya  ] to either efficiently distribute oil wealth or develop other economic sectors , he said the sooner further privatization occurred , the better . 
He , too , was willing to forego political reform - " I don't give a damn about politics " - in exchange for continued economic reform . 
A xxxxxxxxxxxx in the eastern city of [LOC Tobruk  ] echoed those sentiments . 
Asked about proposed government re-structuring , he was dismissive . 
The regime , in his view , was a police state and could not be expected to willingly concede political authority . 
His primary concern was that his four sons xxxxxxxxxxxx had not been able to earn enough to get married . 
Like many [MISC Middle Eastern  ] countries , it is expected that grooms and their families will provide fully furnished homes for newly-married couples . 
Increased expectations about what that means - modern appliances are expensive - have made it increasingly difficult for young men to save enough to marry , delaying the age at which they do so . 
In a conservative society in which marriage constitutes an important social anchor and bellwether of worth , that trend has worrying social consequences . 
7 . 
( C ) Comment: As reported ref E , proposed direct distribution of oil wealth to the people - an idea floated by [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi last March that has captured the popular imagination - dominated the recently concluded session of the Basic People 's Congresses . 
An attendant proposal to dismantle most ministry-equivalents and privatize a large number of services currently managed and provided by the government was given relatively short shrift . 
The focus on wealth distribution reflects the fact that ordinary [MISC Libyans  ] , exhausted by the pervasive chaos that has characterized al-Qadhafi 's regime and its successive political-economic experiments , are frustrated by politics and seek the comfort of a marginally better day-to-day quality of life . 
Despite talk of a possible constitution and perhaps even elections , [MISC Libyans  ] are mostly sober-minded about the prospect and likely pace of political change , at least while [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi remains alive and in control . 
But they are cautiously optimistic that the limited economic reforms that have been undertaken to date will continue , and that their salaries will somehow increase enough to allow them to enjoy more of the consumer goods that they were largely deprived of for more than 20 years . 
All eyes are now on the upcoming session of the General People 's [ORG Congress  ] , expected to convene early next week .
