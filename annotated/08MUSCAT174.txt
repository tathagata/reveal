End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) CENTCOM Commander Admiral [PER Fallon  ] , accompanied by the Ambassador , met February 19 with [PER Sultan Qaboos  ] bin Sa'id for approximately 2 hours at one of the [PER Sultan  ] 's castles -- [MISC Husn  ] al Shumugh -- in the interior of [LOC Oman  ] . 
( [ORG Note: The Sultan  ] was outside of [LOC Muscat  ] on his annual 4-6 week " meet the people tour " during which he visits selected sites outside the capital . 
End Note . 
) The [PER Sultan  ] appeared in good health and was cheerful , although he commented that his role as ruler of [LOC Oman  ] was demanding and did not allow him time to do all the things he wanted to do , such as reading more books . 
" My office is wherever I am , " he stated , noting that he constantly had to attend to paperwork and urgent requests from his staff , among other tasks . 
The [PER Sultan  ] added that despite his busy schedule , he always made time to " watch the news , " though he did not elaborate on his preferred media outlet. ------------------- CONCERNS ABOUT [LOC IRAQ  ] ------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [PER Sultan  ] expressed concern over a premature withdrawal of [LOC U.S.  ] forces from [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Recognizing recent improvements in the security situation , he counseled that [MISC American  ] troops should only leave " when the time is right . 
" He stressed that [MISC Iraqis  ] had to " take charge " of the fate of their country , but questioned whether the different factions would be able to " come together " to accomplish this . 
He pointedly asked the Admiral , " Do you really think Prime Minister [PER Maliki  ] and his government are capable of pulling the country together ? 
" The [PER Sultan  ] did not directly respond to [LOC Admiral Fallon  ] 's comment on the need for assistance and investment for [LOC Iraq  ] from elsewhere in the region . 
Instead , he stated that if the [MISC Iraqi  ] people helped themselves and invested in their own country , others would follow suit. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [PER Sultan  ] appeared to follow events in [LOC Iraq  ] closely . 
He commented , for example , that the [MISC Kurds  ] had apparently " come out well " in recent central government talks on budget issues , and asked about the status of electricity production in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The [PER Sultan  ] seemed to take a particular interest in [LOC Admiral Fallon  ] 's discussion of [MISC Iraqi  ] [ORG Shia  ] leader [PER Abdul Aziz  ] al-Hakim , including the status of [PER Hakim  ] 's health and his possible successors. -------------------------- [ORG INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT  ] -------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In addition to emphasizing the need for outside investment in [LOC Iraq  ] , Admiral [ORG Fallon  ] highlighted the importance of assistance from regional states for infrastructure development in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and other [MISC Central Asian  ] nations . 
Again the [PER Sultan  ] sidestepped the issue and shifted the conversation to the critical role of roads and highways in economic development . 
He then mentioned infrastructure projects for [LOC Oman  ] currently under consideration , including construction of a new dam and a freight rail line from the northern port of [LOC Sohar  ] to the planned port in [LOC Duqm  ] . 
The [PER Sultan  ] hoped that the southern port of [LOC Salalah  ] could be linked by rail to [LOC Muscat  ] and , eventually , to other [ORG GCC  ] states . 
MUSCAT 00000174 002 OF 003 -------------- [MISC IRANIAN  ] ISSUES -------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [PER Sultan  ] commented that the [MISC Iranians  ] are " not fools , " and claimed that [LOC Tehran  ] realized there are " certain lines it cannot cross " ( i.e. , direct confrontation with the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) . 
Regarding [ORG GCC  ] relations with the [MISC Iranian  ] government , he stated , " [LOC Iran  ] is a big country with muscles and we must deal with it . 
" He continued that [LOC Iran  ] 's " charm offensive " in the region had achieved a degree of success as some [ORG GCC  ] authorities ( he did not mention names ) were now less suspicious of [MISC Iranian  ] intentions . 
The [PER Sultan  ] added , laughing , that " I must say that as long as ( the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) is on the horizon , we have nothing to fear . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Responding to Admiral [ORG Fallon  ] 's frustration with [MISC Iranian  ] interference in [LOC Iraq  ] , the [PER Sultan  ] remarked that [MISC Iranian  ] meddling abroad was " almost a game " to the regime in [LOC Tehran  ] , and said that [LOC Iran  ] 's leaders would have to stop this practice if [LOC Iran  ] wanted to " join the world as a noble country . 
" The [PER Sultan  ] hoped that [MISC Iraqi  ] leaders would clearly tell and convince [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] during his upcoming visit to [LOC Iraq  ] to cease [LOC Iran  ] 's unhelpful interference in their internal affairs . 
On the possibility that [LOC Iran  ] is waiting out the President 's final term before re-assessing its strategy , the [PER Sultan  ] said that [LOC Tehran  ] should realize that it has to deal with the [LOC U.S.  ] as a country , and not just the current administration. ------------------ THE SEARCH FOR GAS ------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) After noting [MISC Iranian  ] dependence on imports of refined fuel , the [PER Sultan  ] described [LOC Oman  ] 's efforts to obtain more natural gas to fuel growing domestic power needs and large-scale industrial projects . 
[LOC Oman  ] had committed too much of its limited gas production to long-term liquefied natural gas ( [ORG LNG  ] ) export contracts . 
As a result , the government was trying to boost production by taking smaller and less productive gas fields away from [ORG Petroleum Development Oman  ] ( [ORG PDO  ] ) -- 60% owned by the government and 34% owned by [ORG Royal Dutch Shell  ] -- and awarding them to outside companies such as [MISC British  ] Gas and [ORG BP  ] . 
The [PER Sultan  ] claimed these firms were in a better position to increase productivity in these fields , and pointed to the progress of [MISC U.S.-based  ] [ORG Occidental Petroleum Company  ] in raising oil production in former [ORG PDO  ] concession areas , such as [ORG Mukhaizna.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Looking offshore , the [PER Sultan  ] said he hoped that new gas fields would be found in the [LOC Gulf  ] of [LOC Oman  ] to help ease the country 's natural gas shortage . 
[LOC India  ] 's [ORG Reliance Industries  ] was currently exploring a deepwater oil and gas block in this body of water , but had made no significant discoveries yet . 
[LOC Qatar  ] would begin supplying gas to [LOC Oman  ] by 2013 , the [PER Sultan  ] noted , but not in quantities sufficient to meet outstanding needs . 
He added that [LOC Oman  ] was still supplying limited gas from [LOC Musandam  ] to [LOC Ras al-Khaimah  ] in the [LOC UAE  ] due to an agreement he made with its emir -- and which the [PER Sultan  ] felt he could not break -- well before [LOC Oman  ] was squeezed for this resource. --------------------------- THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION --------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Sultan  ] Qaboos shared that he placed a great deal of importance on education , and noted that a study of history provided the context needed to better understand present trends and events . 
Regarding claims that some rulers in the region wanted to keep their people uneducated in order to more easily control them , the [PER Sultan  ] explained that this strategy could easily backfire as it also left the populace more susceptible to influence by extremists , such as the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] . 
Former [MISC Egyptian  ] president and pan-Arabist leader [PER Gamal Abdal Nasser  ] , the [PER Sultan  ] said , had " set the region back " by being " anti-everything " and engaging in vitriolic rhetoric designed to keep the masses ignorant. ----------------------------------- EMPOWERING THE GOVERNMENT AND WOMEN ----------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) On domestic politics , the [PER Sultan  ] announced that he would hold the first-ever combined meeting of his Cabinet of Ministers and the [ORG Majlis  ] al-Shura ( the directly elected lower MUSCAT 00000174 003 OF 003 house of [LOC Oman  ] 's bicameral advisory body ) on February 26 . 
By meeting together , the [PER Sultan  ] hoped that the Cabinet and the [ORG Majlis  ] would learn how to cooperate better and jointly focus on important issues . 
He commented that both bodies also needed to " demonstrate more leadership " and avoid past foot-dragging on promises made to the populace . 
" People need to see the results of decisions , " the [PER Sultan  ] stated. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Letting Admiral [ORG Fallon  ] and the Ambassador in on a " secret , " the [PER Sultan  ] confided that he planned to call for a conference of all " notable women " in [LOC Oman  ] in 2009 in a bid to encourage [MISC Omani  ] women to expand their participation and leadership in different aspects of [MISC Omani  ] society . 
Minister of [ORG Social Development  ] , [PER Dr. Sharifa  ] bint [PER Khalfan al-Yahyaiya  ] ( one of [LOC Oman  ] 's three female cabinet ministers ) will chair the meeting on the [PER Sultan  ] 's behalf . 
Lamenting that no women won seats in the October 2007 election for the [ORG Majlis  ] al-Shura , [PER Sultan  ] Qaboos observed that [MISC Omani  ] women were stuck in tradition and needed to be empowered to " take more charge " and to be " less shy . 
" " Some customs ( regarding women ) , " he added , " shouldn't be kept . 
" Nevertheless , gradual change is occurring in [LOC Oman  ] , the [PER Sultan  ] asserted . 
His philosophy was to " let it happen , " rather than hold it up to public debate , as the latter course of action often led to factional fighting , internal strife , and other ills. --------------------------------------------- A RECURRENT THEME: MORE RESPONSIVE GOVERNMENT --------------------------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) In concluding the meeting , [PER Sultan Qaboos  ] returned to his goal of improving the responsiveness of the [MISC Omani  ] government to citizen concerns . 
He stated that he would be pressing " harder " on his ministers to engage in more and better public relations efforts before the [MISC Omani  ] police and to effectively enforce their decisions so that the people could see the benefits of announced actions . 
Giving one particular example , the [PER Sultan  ] said that rather than simply announce a new development project , the government should explain the downstream employment opportunities the project would generate for [MISC Omani  ] citizens . 
Effective cooperation between ministries and the [ORG Majlis Oman  ] was also needed to strengthen the civil institutional framework in [LOC Oman  ] , the [PER Sultan  ] added. ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) In discussing his desire for operational change in the senior government ranks , the [PER Sultan  ] twice implied ( but did not directly state ) that such change was needed to prepare the country for his eventual departure from power . 
The [PER Sultan  ] 's comments indicated that he may feel the government is too dependent on his authority and should be empowered to run more effectively without constant direction from the palace . 
End Comment. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 .
