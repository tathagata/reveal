( U ) This is an action request . 
See paragraph 2. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Post requests [ORG FBI  ] recall information about [PER Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam  ] ( [ORG JUI-F  ] ) leader [PER Fazlur Rehman  ] noted in [LOC Reftel  ] . 
[LOC Reftel  ] indicates that an individual ‘Fasil [PER Ul Rehman’  ] believed to be associated with [ORG Jamaat-e-Islami  ] ( [ORG JI  ] ) is behind the March 2008 bombing in [LOC Islamabad  ] . 
[LOC Reftel  ] then suggests that ‘Fasil [PER Ul Rehman’  ] refers to political party leader [PER Fazlur Rehman  ] of the [ORG JUI-F  ] . 
Post requests that [ORG FBI  ] recall this information from all hardcopy and database records due to discrepancies and errors in the report. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Prominent [LOC Pakistan  ] politician [PER Fazlur Rehman  ] is not associated with the [ORG JI  ] , but instead leads his own political party , the [ORG JUI-F  ] . 
From 2002-2007 the two parties allied with other religious parties in the coalition [PER Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal  ] ( [ORG MMA  ] ) . 
However , the [ORG JUI-F  ] and [ORG JI  ] retained separate leadership structures as well as separate political objectives and methods. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Fazlur Rehman’s  ] [ORG JUI-F  ] is a conservative [MISC Deobandi  ] religious party that recently has joined the new [ORG Pakistan People’s Party  ] ( [ORG PPP  ] ) led government . 
[PER Rehman  ] , more politician than mullah , has been a prominent and legitimate figure in [MISC Pakistani  ] politics since the 1980s . 
[PER Rehman  ] has publicly denounced terrorist attacks , but prefers to use negotiations rather than military force against militants . 
Although he is known to have contacts with [MISC Taliban  ] and their sympathizers , he has negotiated with religious militants on the government’s behalf , garnering him criticism from the more hard-line religious sectors . 
[PER Rehman  ] also has been a frequent and cooperative interlocutor with Post and professes his support for cooperation with the [LOC United States.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [ORG JI  ] is a religious party that appeals to a narrow sector of the educated , conservative urban middle class . 
[ORG JI  ] , which has a vibrant student wing , began as a movement for social change based on [LOC Sharia  ] . 
The [ORG JI  ] party policy does not support violence as a means to achieve their political agenda , however , the party quietly has supported jihad in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Kashmir  ] by providing recruits from their student corps . 
The party does not support violence perpetuated within [LOC Pakistan  ] , such as the recent attack on the restaurant in [LOC Islamabad  ] . 
In addition , ‘Fasil [PER Ul Rehman’  ] and ‘Fazlur [ORG Rehman”  ] are extremely common [MISC Pakistani  ] names , making it impossible to accurately identify the individual in [LOC Reftel  ] with the prominent [ORG JUI-F  ] politician .
