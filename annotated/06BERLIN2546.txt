Reason: 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) Summary . 
With three weeks to go , opinion polls and political commentators and contacts all say [LOC Berlin  ] 's September 17 election of a new parliament is the [ORG SPD  ] 's to lose . 
The [MISC Social Democrats  ] lead the [MISC Christian Democrats  ] by over ten percent in all polls and the ratings gap between the two parties' candidates for Mayor is even greater . 
Real interest is already focusing on whom the [ORG SPD  ] will chose as a coalition partner – the Left Party.PDS with which the [ORG SPD  ] now governs the city , or the [ORG Green Party  ] . 
The election , which is expected , in essence , to confirm [LOC Berlin  ] 's left of center majority , will have no immediate national political implications . 
However , Mayor [PER Wowereit  ] has signaled his interest in playing a role in national [ORG SPD  ] politics in the future . 
Because of the predicted low turnout , concerns have been expressed by some observers that parties of the far-right will gain seats in some of [LOC Berlin  ] 's district assemblies . 
End Summary . 
The [ORG Campaign:  ] [ORG SPD  ] in Charge ; [ORG CDU  ] in [LOC Tatters  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The state of [LOC Berlin  ] leaves much to be desired – the weak school system has been the subject of a steady drumbeat of critical headlines for months ; the business climate is at best stagnant and high-profile departures or attempted departures of big employers are an issue ; the city 's enormous debt continues to grow steadily and is now at 60 billion euros . 
Nonetheless , support for the [ORG SPD  ] remains strong at 30-35 percent ( ahead of the 29 percent taken in 2001 ) and Mayor [PER Wowereit  ] is genuinely popular . 
[ORG CDU xxxxx  ] admits that the [ORG CDU  ] 's lead candidate , [PER Friedbert Pflueger  ] , simply cannot match [PER Wowereit  ] for charisma and campaign skills . 
Moreover , the [LOC Berlin  ] [ORG CDU  ] has been damaged by: 1 ) years of infighting and tension between modernizers in the party , including [PER Pflueger  ] , and old-school conservatives ; and 2 ) the lingering effects of a banking scandal that drove it from office in 2001 . 
[PER Pflueger  ] , from [LOC Lower Saxony  ] , also suffers from a carpetbagger image – his last-minute announcement that he would give up his [ORG Bundestag  ] membership and [ORG Defense Ministry State Secretaryship  ] to concentrate on [LOC Berlin  ] has not helped . 
The [ORG CDU has  ] been hovering at around 20 percent in polls since even before the campaign began. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG CDU  ] and [ORG SPD  ] contacts agree that the turnout for the election will likely be very low . 
[ORG SPD Berlin Business Manager Ruediger Scholz  ] fears this could hurt the [ORG SPD  ] more than the [ORG CDU and  ] so the party intends to focus on getting its core supporters to the polls in the final weeks of the campaign . 
[PER Scholz  ] points out that a low turnout is likely to benefit smaller parties with more ideological voters – meaning the far-left [ORG WASG  ] and the far-right [ORG NPD  ] and [MISC Republicans  ] . 
He and most other interlocutors seem to expect that the far-right will win seats in the district assemblies in at least some of [LOC Berlin  ] 's eastern districts while the [ORG WASG  ] could win seats in [LOC Kreuzberg-Friedrichshain  ] . 
The threshold for entry is winning only three percent of district votes . 
Neither far-right nor far-left is given any chance of clearing the five percent threshold for entry into the state parliament . 
[ORG Coalition Politics  ] ----------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The Left Party.PDS , according to [LOC Berlin  ] leader [PER Klaus Lederer  ] , cannot expect a repeat of its 23 percent performance in 2001 . 
That showing was the result of the banking scandal , which briefly tarred the [ORG SPD  ] as well as [ORG CDU  ] , and the star quality of then-PDS lead candidate [PER Gregor Gysi  ] , now fully occupied in the [ORG Bundestag  ] . 
Polls put the [ORG LP.PDS  ] at around 15 percent , which is where the [MISC Greens  ] also stand . 
Thus , either party could be a plausible partner for the [ORG SPD  ] . 
Mayor [PER Wowereit  ] has stated his desire to remain in government with the [ORG LP.PDS  ] , though the two parties have not concluded a formal electoral alliance . 
The [ORG SPD  ] 's [PER Scholz  ] , [ORG Green Berlin  ] caucus leader [PER Sibyll Klotz  ] , and [LOC Berlin  ] FDP leader [PER Markus Loening  ] all agree that the [ORG LP.PDS  ] would make the more comfortable partner for [PER Wowereit  ] because of the ease of their cooperation thus far and because keeping the [ORG LP.PDS  ] in government defuses a large bloc of voters who could be mobilized easily to protest the cuts and privatizations which the government has used to try and recover control of the budget . 
However , [PER Scholz  ] notes that it would probably be better for the city and for [PER Wowereit  ] given his political ambitions , if he were to form a coalition with the [MISC Greens  ] , who are more centrist ( especially on finance ) and , at the federal level , presentable . 
[ORG Green  ] state parliament member [PER Oezcan Mutlu  ] argued strongly that [PER Wowereit  ] will opt for the [MISC Greens  ] based on these considerations , though he acknowledged that working with the [MISC Greens  ] would be harder . 
He even said that , given [ORG Green  ] fractiousness , they would have to bring a 7-8 seat majority into a coalition to make it stable. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) If the numbers did not work out for a two-party coalition ( and all our contacts reject the idea of a [ORG Grand Coalition  ] ) , then the most likely option seems to be an [MISC SPD-LP.PDS-Green  ] alliance . 
However , some in the FDP ( now at 8-9 percent in polls ) hope that in such a situation , they might have a chance of sidling into power . 
[LOC Berlin  ] FDP lead candidate [PER Martin Lindner  ] and [PER Loening  ] have told us that they believe the [MISC Greens  ] would rather work with them than the [ORG LP.PDS  ] . 
This seems quite a long shot , though , as [LOC Berlin  ] [MISC Greens  ] stand quite far to the left in the [ORG Green  ] spectrum . 
Comment ------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [LOC Berlin  ] election is unlikely to have major national significance under any circumstances . 
The [ORG Grand Coalition  ] recognizes this and , unlike in the period before the spring elections in [LOC Baden-Wuerttemberg  ] , [LOC Rhineland-Palatinate  ] and [LOC Saxony-Anhalt  ] , is not postponing debate on contentious issues . 
However , in two aspects the elections are noteworthy . 
First , a victory will boost [PER Klaus Wowereit  ] 's chance of playing a greater role in the [ORG SPD  ] nationally , especially as he is seen as a standard-bearer for the party left . 
Second , even very localized success by the far-right will provoke comment and a measure of consternation and signal that the particular problem posed by far-rightist ideologues in eastern [LOC Germany  ] remains to be resolved .
