( U ) This is an action request . 
Please see paragraph 5. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) Background: In October 2007 , we shared with the government of [LOC India  ] information related to the supply by the [MISC Indian  ] firm [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] of high-density MTCR-controlled graphite to [ORG Iran’s Ward Company  ] ( [ORG Refs A & B  ] ) . 
We later advised the [ORG GOI  ] that the intended end-user of the graphite was the [ORG Sahand Aluminum Parts Industrial Company  ] ( [ORG SAPICO  ] ) , a cover company for the [ORG Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group  ] ( [ORG SHIG  ] ) , [ORG Iran’s  ] primary developer of liquid-fueled ballistic missiles ( Ref I ) . 
In response to a follow-on [LOC U.S.  ] demarche in November 2007 concerning additional consignments of graphite being readied by [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] for shipment to [PER Ward  ] , [MISC Indian  ] officials advised us that they had prevented the onward shipment of one such consignment , and that they were investigating the matter ( [ORG Refs  ] C - E ) . 
We approached [LOC New Delhi  ] again in December 2007 with information indicating that four to five tons of graphite awaiting shipment to [PER Ward  ] had been removed from [MISC XXXXXXXXXXXX’s  ] warehouse ( Ref F ) . 
The [ORG GOI  ] informed us that they had not cleared the graphite shipment for export , that nothing had gone to the final destination , and that they had taken unspecified action on the case ( [ORG Refs G & H  ] ) . 
In April 2008 , the [ORG Times of India  ] ( [ORG TOI  ] ) reported that in October 2007 , [MISC Indian  ] [ORG Customs  ] in [LOC Mumbai  ] prevented [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] from shipping 1,150 kg of graphite to [PER Ward  ] , and that a second consignment of [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] graphite bound for [LOC Dubai  ] was subsequently stopped ( Ref K ) . 
We requested additional information from [LOC India  ] on the status of this graphite , but have not yet received an response ( Ref K ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) Objectives: We want to reiterate our appreciation to [MISC Indian  ] officials for the effective action they took in this case , and to remind them that we remain interested in any additional information they can share with us related to the final disposition of the graphite , as well as the results of their investigations or any legal proceedings that resulted from this activity. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) Objectives ( continued ) : We also want to advise the [ORG GOI  ] of information indicating that as of mid-April 2009 , [PER Ward  ] and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] were again engaged in business- related discussions . 
We are concerned that this recent contact could involve additional efforts to supply graphite to [MISC Iranian  ] entities , and want to urge [MISC Indian  ] authorities to investigate and take all appropriate measures to prevent [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] from acting as a supplier of sensitive materials to [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Action Request: Department requests [ORG Embassy New Delhi  ] approach appropriate host government officials to deliver the talking points in Paragraph 6 and report response . 
Talking points may be left as a non-paper. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) Begin talking points/non-paper: ( SECRET REL [LOC INDIA  ] ) -- We would like to raise with you a matter of proliferation concern and request your government’s assistance in investigating this activity . 
-- In October 2007 , we shared information with you indicating that in July 2007 , the [MISC Indian  ] company [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] offered to provide 255 blocks of MTCR-controlled , high density graphite to [ORG Iran’s Ward Commercial Company  ] . 
-- We later advised you that the intended end-user of the graphite was the [ORG Sahand Aluminum Parts Industrial Company  ] ( [ORG SAPICO  ] ) , a cover name for the [ORG Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group  ] ( [ORG SHIG  ] ) . 
[ORG SHIG  ] is [ORG Iran’s  ] primary developer of liquid propelled ballistic missiles and is an entity designated under [ORG United Nations Security Council Resolution  ] 1737 . 
-- In late November 2007 , we expressed our concerns that [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was working to ship additional consignments of graphite to [PER Ward  ] , and that we were aware that [MISC Indian  ] officials were holding a shipment of potentially nuclear-grade graphite in the [ORG Mumbai Air Cargo Complex  ] near the international terminal . 
-- We were subsequently pleased to hear that your government prevented the onward shipment to [LOC Iran  ] of the graphite being held at the [ORG Mumbai Air Cargo Complex  ] , and that you were investigating this matter . 
-- In December 2007 , we informed you that four to five tons of graphite being readied for shipment to [PER Ward  ] had been removed from [MISC XXXXXXXXXXXX’s  ] warehouse . 
-- You responded that your government had not cleared the graphite shipment for export because your investigation was not yet complete , and that the graphite had likely been moved to a location where it could be stored for a longer period of time . 
-- You later advised us that nothing had gone to the final destination , and that your government had taken unspecified action on the case . 
-- In April 2008 , the [ORG Times of India  ] ( [ORG TOI  ] ) reported that in October 2007 , [MISC Indian  ] [ORG Customs  ] in [LOC Mumbai  ] prevented [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] from shipping 1,150 kg of graphite to [PER Ward  ] , and that a second consignment of [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] graphite bound for [LOC Dubai  ] was subsequently stopped . 
-- We commend [MISC Indian  ] authorities for stopping these shipments , and remain interested in any additional information you could share with us related to the final disposition of this graphite . 
We also would appreciate knowing the results of your investigations or any legal proceedings that resulted from this activity . 
-- In addition , we want to advise you of information indicating that as of mid-April 2009 , representatives of [PER Ward  ] and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] were again engaged in business-related discussions . 
-- We are concerned that this recent contact between [PER Ward  ] and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] could be related to additional efforts to supply graphite to [MISC Iranian  ] entities of proliferation concern . 
-- Given Ward’s history of acting as an intermediary for [ORG Iran’s  ] ballistic missile program , we urge you to investigate this information and take whatever measures are necessary to prevent the supply Xby [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] of sensitive materials to [LOC Iran  ] . 
-- We appreciate India’s cooperation on nonproliferation issues and look forward to hearing of any actions your government takes in response to this information .
