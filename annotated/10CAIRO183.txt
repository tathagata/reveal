( C ) Key Points: -- Minister of [ORG Social Solidarity  ] ( [ORG MSS  ] ) [PER Ali El-Meselhi  ] distanced himself from a [ORG MSS  ] diplomatic note which took issue with [MISC MEPI  ] funding of [MISC Egyptian  ] [ORG NGOs  ] . 
He explained that the note was coordinated by Minister of [ORG International Cooperation Fayza Aboulnaga  ] . 
-- [PER El-Meselhi  ] is supportive of [LOC U.S.  ] funding of [MISC NGO  ] activities and appreciates the rigorous [LOC U.S.  ] oversight and monitoring associated with these programs . 
However , he continues to have funding , coordination , and monitoring concerns with other donors and beneficiaries , particularly given [LOC Egypt  ] 's cash-based economy. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Comment: Contrary to what his ministry 's diplomatic note implied , [PER El-Meselhi  ] showed little interest in altering the status quo and seems unlikely to press us further on [MISC MEPI  ] funding of non-registered [ORG NGOs  ] . 
The usefulness of [MISC El-Meshelhi  ] 's support , however , is limited as [ORG MOI  ] and [ORG EGIS  ] remain the final arbiters in the [MISC NGO  ] funding and registration approval process , and both appear content to let applications languish or deny them without explanation. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Ambassador met with Minister of [ORG Social Solidarity  ] ( [ORG MSS  ] ) [PER Ali El-Meselhi  ] January 28 to discuss a December 23 , 2009 diplomatic note from the [ORG MSS  ] which implied that in providing [MISC MEPI  ] funds to non-registered [ORG NGOs  ] the [LOC U.S.  ] was violating [ORG GOE  ] law . 
The Ambassador also raised continued delays faced by [MISC U.S.-based  ] [ORG NGOs  ] seeking to register in [LOC Egypt  ] as well as several long-pending [MISC NGO  ] requests for [ORG GOE  ] approval of foreign-funded programs . 
[ORG USAID Mission  ] Director and Econ Counselor accompanied. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The Ambassador began by noting that [MISC MEPI  ] has been funding programs in [LOC Egypt  ] for many years and nothing in current [MISC MEPI  ] activities represents anything new . 
She added that , in response to [ORG GOE  ] concerns , the [LOC U.S.  ] had decided last year that only registered [ORG NGOs  ] would be eligible to receive [ORG ESF  ] funds while non-registered [ORG NGOs  ] would continue to be eligible for [MISC MEPI  ] and other non-ESF [ORG USG  ] financial support. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER El-Meselhi  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] policy on [ORG ESF  ] funding for registered [ORG NGOs  ] was " extremely positive . 
" He distanced himself from the December 23 , 2009 diplomatic note , saying that it had been coordinated with the Minister of [ORG International Cooperation Fayza Aboulnaga  ] . 
The Ambassador pointed out that we do not see any legal impediment to funding non-registered [MISC Egyptian  ] groups and that the [LOC U.S.  ] sees the benefit of supporting civil society in broad terms . 
[PER El-Meselhi  ] asserted that it was not a question of whether recipient organizations were legal or not , but whether they made the appropriate notifications to the [ORG GOE  ] . 
He explained that most [ORG NGOs  ] remain unregistered , and the [ORG GOE  ] is concerned about sufficient coordination and monitoring of their activities , particularly since 90 percent of all monetary transactions in [LOC Egypt  ] are on a cash basis. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The Ambassador assured [PER El-Meselhi  ] that [ORG USAID  ] and [MISC MEPI  ] exercise strict oversight of funded programs . 
[PER El-Meselhi  ] acknowledged this noting that " we don't question [LOC U.S.  ] funding , " but rather other foreign and domestic funding . 
He continued , " Frankly , I definitely know you are doing something right . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The Ambassador and [ORG USAID Mission  ] Director raised with [PER El-Meselhi  ] long-pending [MISC NGO  ] requests for [ORG MSS  ] approval of foreign-funded programs , and provided a list of several such requests submitted more than six months ago . 
They also asked that [PER El-Meselhi  ] support the registration applications of several [MISC U.S.-based NGO  ] , most of which have been active in [LOC Egypt  ] for several years or more . 
The Ambassador stressed the importance of permitting the registering of [MISC U.S.-based  ] [ORG NGOs  ] , particularly in light of the [ORG USG  ] 's response to [ORG GOE  ] concerns over [ORG ESF  ] funding of non-registered [ORG NGOs  ] . 
[PER El-Meselhi  ] promised to review the list of proposed programs awaiting approval and said he would provide a reply within a week . 
He noted that while he remains supportive of [MISC U.S.-funded  ] programs , the Minister of Interior and [MISC Egyptian  ] Intelligence Services have the final say on [MISC NGO  ] programs and [MISC NGO  ] registration requests .
