[LOC ISLAMABAD  ] 21222 [PER B. PESHAWAR  ] 653 [PER C. ISLAMABAD  ] 21882 [PER D. ISLAMABAD  ] 16421 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Ryan C. Crocker  ] , Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: In a November 13 meeting , the Ambassador and Interior Minister [PER Sherpao  ] reviewed [MISC U.S.-Pakistani  ] cooperation on the investigation into the 2006 [MISC Karachi Consulate  ] bombing . 
[PER Sherpao  ] assured the Ambassador that the Government of [LOC Pakistan  ] ( [ORG GOP  ] ) is committed to defending the conviction of [PER Omar Saeed Sheikh  ] for the 2002 murder of [ORG Wall Street Journal  ] reporter [PER Daniel Pearl  ] . 
The Minister re-affirmed that government plans to charge the leader of a [MISC Punjab-based  ] militant organization under the Security of [LOC Pakistan  ] Act , but said that the arrest would be delayed until later in November . 
[PER Sherpao  ] was receptive to the [MISC Ambassador’s  ] suggestion that his Ministry establish a dedicated intellectual property rights unit in the [ORG Federal Investigative Agency  ] ( [ORG FIA  ] ) , but did not respond to the [MISC Ambassador’s  ] query regarding the whereabouts of missing AMCIT Dr. [PER Sardar Sarki  ] . 
End summary . 
[ORG FBI Cooperation  ] --------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The Ambassador opened the conversation by previewing the November 17 visit of [ORG FBI  ] Director [PER Robert Mueller  ] to [LOC Islamabad  ] and reviewing the status of [ORG FBI  ] cooperation with the [ORG GOP  ] on several high-profile terrorism cases . 
Minister [PER Sherpao  ] indicated that arrangements would soon be made to allow Embassy [ORG LEGAT  ] officers access to two suspects in the March 2006 [MISC Karachi Consulate  ] bombing . 
[PER Sherpao  ] noted that the third suspect in the case -- [PER Qari Zafar  ] , believed to be the mastermind behind the attack -- has absconded to [ORG North Waziristan Agency  ] . 
According to the Minister , police authorities came close to capturing [PER Zafar  ] during the recent [MISC Eid-al-Fitr  ] holiday ; investigators continue to follow his trail . 
The Ambassador was pleased to hear that investigators are pursuing [PER Zafar  ] vigorously , both to bring him to justice and for his potential value as a source of information regarding this sophisticated terror attack . 
[PER Sherpao  ] also volunteered that the Ministry should be able to arrange for [ORG LEGAT  ] officers to have access to [ORG Federal Investigation Agency  ] ( [ORG FIA  ] ) reports before Director Mueller’s arrival . 
[PER Omar Saeed Sheikh  ] ----------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The Ambassador asked about the status of the case against [PER Omar Saeed Sheikh  ] , who was convicted in the kidnapping and murder of [PER Daniel Pearl  ] in 2002 . 
The Ambassador stressed that the [LOC U.S.  ] shares the [MISC GOP’s  ] determination that [PER Sheikh  ] not escape justice through some legal loophole and observed that there are two active indictments against [PER Sheikh  ] pending in [LOC U.S.  ] courts , [PER Sherpao  ] assured the Ambassador that an interagency team comprising MOI , the [ORG Law Ministry  ] and the [ORG National Police Bureau  ] is following this case closely . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX . 
Authorities have been carefully monitoring Sheikh’s activities in prison , shifting him between high-security facilities in order to prevent him from enlisting assistance or support from fellow inmates or [LOC ISLAMABAD  ] 00022025 002 OF 003 prison employees . 
[PER Sherpao  ] acknowledged the [MISC Ambassador’s  ] comments that the [LOC U.S.  ] would be eager to discuss transferring [PER Sheikh  ] to face prosecution in [MISC American  ] courts if it appeared that he might win his current appeal , but declined to respond directly to the offer , saying that he is confident that the [MISC Pakistani  ] conviction would hold and that [PER Sheikh  ] would be executed as sentenced . 
( Note: According to [PER Sherpao  ] , the interagency team guiding the [MISC GOP’s  ] prosecution of [PER Sheikh  ] has also been tasked with reviewing all high-profile terror cases , traveling to each province to review files and offer guidance to local prosecutors . 
[PER Sherpao  ] said that the Chief Justice of the [ORG Pakistan Supreme Court  ] has convened provincial [ORG Criminal Investigation Division  ] ( [ORG CID  ] ) Inspectors General and Home Secretaries to coordinate enhanced training and support for judges presiding in terror-related cases . 
The outreach is intended to stiffen the judges’ resolve in the face of potential intimidation and to reduce procedural delays . 
End note . 
) [PER Hafiz Saeed  ] ----------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The Ambassador also questioned [PER Sherpao  ] about the [ORG GOP  ] case against [ORG Lashkar-e-Tayyba/Jammat  ] ud-Dawa ( LeT/JuD ) leader [PER Hafiz Mohammad Saeed  ] . 
( Ref A ) [PER Sherpao  ] repeated his earlier assurance that [PER Saeed  ] would be re-arrested , this time under the Security of [LOC Pakistan  ] Act . 
Heightened domestic sensitivities following the October 31 Pak Mil air strike on a militant madrassa in [LOC Bajaur  ] ( Ref B ) and the apparent retaliatory suicide attack on an Army training facility in [LOC Dirgai  ] ( Ref C ) argued against proceeding against [PER Saeed  ] immediately , [PER Sherpao  ] said . 
He predicted that [PER Saeed  ] would be taken into custody again following the November 20 ( ? ) visit of [LOC UK  ] Prime Minister [PER Blair  ] to [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
In the meantime , security agents are closely monitoring Saeed’s activities . 
[ORG Intellectual Property Rights  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The Ambassador commended the MOI for its cooperation with the [ORG Embassy  ] in building local capacity to protect intellectual property rights ( [ORG IPR  ] ) , noting that the [LOC U.S.  ] has developed an excellent relationship with [ORG FIA  ] personnel enforcing [ORG IPR  ] laws . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] is willing to commit additional resources toward capacity building , but suggests that the [ORG FIA  ] first establish a dedicated [ORG IPR  ] unit so that newly-trained personnel are not transferred to non-IPR duties . 
The Minister called this a sensible suggestion and asked his staff to follow up with the [ORG Embassy  ] . 
Missing Amcit ------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The Ambassador raised ongoing [LOC U.S.  ] concern for the welfare of AMCIT Dr. [PER Sardar Sarki  ] , who disappeared from his home in [LOC Karachi  ] in February 2006 . 
( Ref C ) A credible report in a respected [MISC Pakistani  ] news magazine supports the belief of Dr. [PER Sarki’s  ] family that he is in the custody of [MISC Pakistani  ] security forces . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] is not taking a position on possible [ORG GOP  ] charges against [PER Sarki  ] , the Ambassador said , but we need to know where he is and to have consular access to him . 
Minister [PER Sherpao  ] listened to the [MISC Ambassador’s  ] remarks without comment .
