( C ) Key Points: -The manager of a ready-made garments factory participating in the [ORG Qualifying Industrial Zones  ] ( [ORG QIZ  ] ) program told [PER EconOff  ] that his company has been holding the passports of foreign workers and that it fired an [MISC Egyptian  ] employee for organizing a strike. -This is first case of passports of foreign workers being held by a QIZ-participating employer that EmbOffs have encountered in regular visits to [ORG QIZ  ] factories. -Embassy [LOC Cairo  ] has raised the issue with the [ORG GOE  ] . 
The [ORG Ministry of Trade and Industry  ] has pledged to investigate the matter , and will inform us soon of their planned response to the case. -Despite this case , [ORG NGO  ] 's engaged in labor advocacy tell us that working conditions and labor standards are generally better in [ORG QIZ  ] factories than in other private and public-sector factories. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER EconOff  ] recently met with [PER Oussama Abboud  ] , the Managing Director for the [ORG Kazareen Textile Company  ] , an [MISC Egyptian  ] garment exporter participating in the [ORG Qualifying Industrial Zones  ] ( [ORG QIZ  ] ) program . 
[ORG Kazareen  ] reports $50 million in annual sales , with its biggest contracts coming from [ORG Wal-Mart  ] and the [MISC New York-based Warnaco Group  ] , the parent company for such brands as [PER Calvin Klein  ] , [ORG Speedo  ] , and [PER Chaps.  ] --------------------------------------------- ---------------------- ------ Passports of Foreign Workers Held , [LOC Strike Broken  ] --------------------------------------------- ---------------------- ----- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Abboud  ] said that he legally brought in approximately 60 [MISC Bangladeshi  ] workers to work in his factory in 2008 , joining some 1,700 [MISC Egyptians  ] on [ORG Kazareen  ] 's overall staff . 
( Note: [MISC Egyptian  ] labor regulations limit the non-Egyptian workforce to 10% ) . 
[PER Abboud  ] bluntly told [PER EconOff  ] that [ORG Kazareen  ] management held onto to the passports of the [LOC Bangladeshis  ] . 
He complained that some of the [MISC Bangladeshi  ] workers came to [LOC Egypt  ] to use it as a " gateway " to illegally immigrate to [LOC Europe  ] , and that about half of his [MISC Bangladeshi  ] workers have since left [LOC Egypt  ] for [LOC Italy  ] via boat from [LOC Libya  ] . 
The workers left [LOC Egypt  ] without their passports , since they could not get them back from [LOC Kazareen.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Abboud  ] also said that he overcame a day-long work stoppage in April 2009 by firing the strike 's leader , who had attempted to organize the workforce . 
With the dismissal of the strike leader , all of the other strikers returned to work , and there have been no further efforts to organize. ----------------------------------------- [ORG GOE Response  ] to the Case ---------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) EmbOffs raised the [ORG USG  ] 's concern about the holding of foreign workers' passports to two different [ORG GOE  ] ministries . 
The [ORG Ministry of Manpower  ] and [ORG Emigration  ] ( [ORG MOMM  ] ) , which handles labor issues , denied that such a phenomenon exists in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
However , the [ORG Ministry of Trade and Industry  ] ( [ORG MOTI  ] ) , which handles the [ORG QIZ  ] program , has pledged to investigate the case and respond. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In a January 21 meeting with EmbOffs , Assistant Minister of [ORG Manpower  ] and [ORG Emigration  ] [PER Mervat Wahby  ] said that [ORG MOMM  ] has never discovered any cases of foreign worker 's passports being held in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
[PER Wahby  ] noted that her ministry has 600 labor inspectors who monitor factory conditions in [LOC Egypt  ] 's 29 governorates. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER EconOff  ] raised the issue of the alleged labor problems at the [ORG Kazareen  ] factory to [PER Haytham Abdel-Ghany  ] , the [ORG Registration and Audit Manager  ] at the [ORG QIZ Unit  ] in the [ORG Ministry of Trade and Industry  ] ( [ORG MOTI  ] ) . 
[PER Abdel-Ghany  ] expressed the ministry 's concern about the alleged mistreatment , and said that the issue had been referred to Minister of [ORG Trade and Industry  ] Rachid [PER Mohamed Rachid  ] to decide what action should be taken . 
[PER Abdel-Ghany  ] told us on February 10 that [ORG MOTI  ] is investigating the case , and will inform [ORG Embassy Cairo  ] soon of its plans to deal with the matter . 
[PER Abdel-Ghany  ] emphasized that this was an " individual case , " and that [ORG MOTI  ] had not heard of any other [ORG QIZ  ] factory holding the passports of its foreign workers. --------------------------------------------- --- [MISC Bangladeshi  ] [ORG Embassy Response  ] --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Harun Rashid  ] , Charge d' Affairs at the [ORG Embassy  ] of [LOC Bangladesh  ] in [LOC Cairo  ] , told [PER EconOff  ] that cases of mistreatment of [MISC Bangladeshi  ] workers , including the holding of passports , is a phenomenon that is " happening all the time " in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
[PER Rashid  ] said that the [MISC Bangladeshi  ] [ORG Embassy  ] has received numerous complaints from its nationals about it in the past , but has only heard 1-2 complaints in the past year . 
[PER Rashid  ] was unsure if there had been a previous case of such mistreatment in a [ORG QIZ  ] factory , and noted that many past cases involved non-QIZ companies . 
[PER Rashid  ] says that the [MISC Bangladeshi  ] [ORG Embassy  ] does not raise complaints about such cases with the [ORG GOE  ] , but instead appeals directly to factory managers to improve the conditions for [MISC Bangladeshi  ] workers. --------------------------------------------- --------------- Labor Conditions Generally Better in [ORG QIZ  ] 's --------------------------------------------- --------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Local [ORG NGO  ] 's advocating for labor rights report that working conditions are generally better in [ORG QIZ  ] factories , compared to other manufacturers in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
According to the [ORG Land Center for Human Rights  ] , a workers' rights advocacy group , salary and benefits are particularly better in [ORG QIZ  ] factories than in other private sector factories . 
However , according to the [ORG Land Center  ] , the lack of a union representation that plagues [LOC Egypt  ] 's private sector in general is also an issue in [ORG QIZ  ] factories. -------------- Comment -------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) This case marks the first time a [ORG QIZ  ] company has told us directly that it holds the passports of foreign workers . 
In pressing for an expansion of the [ORG QIZ  ] program , [ORG MOTI  ] has insisted that factories operating in [ORG QIZ  ] 's uphold proper labor standards and abide by [ORG QIZ  ] rules . 
[ORG QIZ Unit  ] officials have stated that labor problems previously associated with [MISC Jordanian  ] [ORG QIZ  ] 's have not occurred in [LOC Egypt  ] 's [ORG QIZ  ] 's , and [ORG QIZ Unit  ] officials have been particularly sensitive to comparisons between the [MISC Jordanian  ] and [MISC Egyptian  ] programs . 
[ORG Embassy Cairo  ] will follow up on the issue with [ORG MOTI  ] as it prepares a response to the case. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) EmbOffs have visited a number of factories in the past several months , and have not heard similar reports regarding foreign workers in the factories that may employ up to 10% foreign labor , typically from [LOC South Asia  ] . 
Despite this recent case , labor conditions -- driven primarily by strong compliance programs of garment buyers -- are generally better in factories participating in the [ORG QIZ  ] program than in those not participating in the program .
