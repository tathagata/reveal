[ORG PART  ] 1 - THE FIRST LADY'S FAMILY ( C-RE9-02493 ; C-RE9-02492 ) REF: 08 [LOC BAKU  ] 93 Classified By: XXXXXXXXXXXXX , for reasons 1.4 b and d. <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) SUMMARY: This cable is the first in a series that will highlight the most powerful families in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] , both in terms of economic and political power . 
In this opening issue , we profile the family of [ORG First Lady  ] [PER Mehriban Aliyeva  ] ( born [PER Mehriban Pashayeva  ] ) , and her uncle , former [MISC Azerbaijani  ] Ambassador to the [LOC United States  ] and current Deputy Foreign Minister [PER Hafiz Pashayev  ] . 
[PER Mehriban Aliyeva  ] , besides being the wife of the President , is a Member of [LOC Parliament  ] and head of the [PER Heydar Aliyev Foundation  ] , a non-transparent organization that bills itself as a vehicle for charitable works . 
Other members of the [PER Pashayev  ] family hold powerful positions in government and academia , and are associated with powerful business groups outside the energy sector . 
The [PER Pashayevs  ] are known to operate extensively in [LOC Baku  ] 's rapidly expanding construction/real estate market , and are well invested in the financial and telecommunications sectors . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Observers in [LOC Baku  ] often note that today 's [LOC Azerbaijan  ] is run in a manner similar to the feudalism found in [LOC Europe  ] during the [LOC Middle Ages:  ] a handful of well-connected families control certain geographic areas , as well as certain sectors of the economy . 
By and large , this seems to be the case , with general agreement among leading families to divide the spoils and not disturb one another 's areas of business or geographic control . 
The families also collude , using government mechanisms , to keep out foreign competitors , and entities such as the [ORG State Border Services  ] , [ORG State Customs  ] and tax authorities create barriers that only the best connected can clear . 
As a result , an economy already burgeoning with oil and gas revenues produces enormous opportunity and wealth for a small handful of players that form [LOC Azerbaijan  ] 's elite . 
This series of reports will describe the businesses they run , the regions they control , and the ministries they keep under their thumbs. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Biographical note: Similar to [MISC Russian  ] tradition , many [MISC Azeris  ] still utilize the [MISC Slavic  ] naming convention where the last letter ( s ) of a person 's last name indicates gender . 
[PER Example: Pashayev  ] ( male ) / [PER Pashayeva  ] ( female ) . 
[PER Mehriban  ] 's [PER Heydar Aliyev Fund  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) First Lady [PER Mehriban Aliyeva  ] ( born [PER Mehriban Pashayeva  ] ) is no doubt the most famous member of this clan , playing multiple roles and holding multiple titles . 
Aside from being the President 's wife , she is President of the [PER Heydar Aliyev Fund  ] , which proclaims to be a humanitarian organization constructing schools , hospitals , and youth centers , among other projects . 
These projects provide a constant array of goodwill photo opportunities and advertisements for the [ORG First Lady  ] , as she cuts ribbons on new schools and cultural centers . 
The [PER Fund  ] has its critics , however , who claim that it often fails to provide continued financing for the operation of these projects . 
Much funding seems to be geared towards efforts to explain [LOC Azerbaijan  ] 's side of the [LOC Nagorno-Karabakh  ] conflict , for example in the form of books , brochures and other materials describing what they call a " genocide by [LOC Armenia  ] " in the town of [LOC Khojali.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) Moreover , the organization tends to be non-transparent . 
It is unclear where the money for the [PER Heydar Aliyev Fund  ] 's activities comes from , though many assume that oil revenues fill the coffers . 
There are multiple anecdotal reports of employees of government ministries being forced to make contributions to the [PER Fund  ] . 
The [PER Fund  ] is located in one of the largest historical buildings in downtown [LOC Baku  ] , towering even over the [ORG SOCAR  ] ( [ORG State Oil Company ) Headquarters  ] . 
One opposition politician recently told poloff that receipts of donations to the Foundation are a type of " get out of jail free card " for local officials , meaning that if these officials can show that they donate regularly , higher level officials will allow them to operate businesses and other activities locally without interference . 
[LOC BAKU  ] 00000054 002 OF 003 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Aliyeva  ] is also a Member of [LOC Parliament  ] and Goodwill Ambassador for [ORG UNESCO  ] and [ORG ISESCO  ] ( the [ORG Organization of the Islamic Conference  ] cultural organization ) . 
A recent survey of journalists accredited to [LOC Parliament  ] declared her " the Most Active MP of 2009 in making legislative initiatives . 
" Embassy monitors , who have attended nearly every session over the past year , have never seen her present in [LOC Parliament  ] , an institution that in general is not known for working independently outside the realm of the [ORG Presidential Apparat  ] . 
When she received Members of [ORG Congress  ] in 2008 , she appeared poorly informed about political issues and could only respond knowledgeably about issues relating to the [PER Heydar Aliyev Fund  ] ( reftel ) . 
Academics and Other Endeavors ----------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) Other notable [PER Pashayevs  ] include the [ORG First Lady  ] 's sister [PER Nargiz Pashayeva  ] , who heads the branch of [ORG Moscow State University  ] located in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] ; the [ORG First Lady  ] 's father [PER Arif Pashayev  ] , who leads the [ORG National Aviation Academy  ] ; and the [ORG First Lady  ] 's uncle [PER Hafiz Pashayev  ] ( brother of [PER Arif Pashayev  ] ) , who is a Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Director of the [ORG Azerbaijan Diplomatic Academy  ] . 
[PER Hafiz Pashayev  ] was also [LOC Azerbaijan  ] 's first Ambassador to the [LOC United States  ] , serving in [LOC Washington DC  ] for over 13 years . 
The Deputy Foreign Minister these days spends much time focusing on [ORG his Diplomatic Academy  ] , which is constructing an elaborate new compound ( modeled after NFATC [LOC Arlington  ] ) in central [LOC Baku  ] . 
As a whole , the family , which generally speaks [MISC Russian  ] better than [PER Azeri  ] , is considered the single most powerful family in [LOC Azerbaijan.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) The [PER Pashayev  ] family 's center of power is considered to be [LOC Baku  ] , where [PER Mehriban Aliyeva  ] 's parents were born , and the [LOC Absheron  ] peninsula , with [PER Aliyeva  ] " representing " in parliament a constituency that surrounds [PER Heydar Aliyev  ] [LOC International Airport  ] . 
[PER Aliyeva  ] has also arranged for the building of the [MISC Shuvelan  ] designer shopping center in her constituency , which stands out among the crumbling houses in the area . 
The family is believed to exert control over the [ORG Ministry of Culture and Tourism  ] , the [ORG Ministry of Youth and Sport  ] , the [ORG Ministry of Health  ] , and the [ORG Ministry of Education  ] , simply because these ministries fall under the areas traditionally of interest for a [ORG First Lady  ] . 
In that regard , the [PER Pashayevs  ] have been active in promoting the construction of museums and other cultural sites in [LOC Baku  ] , and at a time were associated with an effort to open a branch of the [LOC Guggenheim  ] museum along [LOC Baku  ] 's waterfront . 
[PER Mehriban Aliyeva  ] 's collection of contemporary art also provided the foundation for [LOC Baku  ] 's new [ORG Museum of Modern Art  ] , which opened quietly last fall . 
The museum was designed by [PER Altay Sadikhzade  ] , a local artist/designer married to [PER Nargiz Pashayeva  ] . 
No expense was spared in the construction of the museum , which highlights [ORG Soviet-era Azerbaijani  ] artists , including [PER Altay  ] ( whose portraits of [PER Mehriban  ] , [PER Nargiz  ] and [PER Arif  ] are at the center of the galleries ) . 
A Vast Empire ------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) The [PER Pashayev  ] family controls [PER Pasha Holding  ] , a conglomerate that includes [LOC Pasha Bank  ] , [ORG Pasha Insurance  ] , [ORG Pasha Construction  ] , and [LOC Pasha Travel  ] . 
The family owns local TV station Lider TV as well as cosmetics producer " [PER Nargiz  ] . 
" The family is believed to control several of the top ten banks in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] , including [ORG Bank Standard  ] and [ORG Kapital Bank  ] , in addition to the newest , [LOC Pasha Bank  ] . 
In November 2009 , [PER Pasha Holding  ] opened [LOC Baku  ] 's first , and so far only , [PER Bentley  ] dealership. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) [ORG Nar Mobile  ] ( which is officially registered as Azerfon ) is also linked to this family , and speculation is that the company is named " [ORG Nar  ] " not only after the [PER Azeri  ] word for pomegranate but also after the [ORG First Lady  ] 's sister [PER Nargiz  ] . 
According to [LOC XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , when President [PER Aliyev  ] visited the [ORG Azercell  ] booth recently at the [LOC Baku  ] telecom expo , he said , " So this is what the [LOC BAKU  ] 00000054 003 OF 003 competition looks like . 
" [ORG Nar Mobile/Azerfon  ] has been growing rapidly and was recently awarded the only 3G license in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] . 
Market leader [ORG Azercell  ] had its license application denied for reasons that remain unclear . 
There have also been commercial disputes between [ORG Azercell  ] and [ORG Nar Mobile/Azerfon  ] . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX says that while [ORG Azercell  ] always pays its interconnection fee responsibilities ( for passing a call from one network to the other ) to [ORG Nar Mobile/Azerfon  ] , the latter does not reciprocate . 
In protest , [ORG Azercell  ] blocked its subscribers ( who form roughly 60 percent of the lucrative [LOC Baku  ] market ) from making calls to or receiving calls from [ORG Nar Mobile/Azerfon  ] users ( who make up 8 percent of the [LOC Baku  ] market ) . 
Pashayev-controlled [ORG Nar Mobile/Azerfon  ] went to court and not surprisingly received a verdict within hours that ordered [ORG Azercell  ] to restore interconnectivity. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S ) Construction projects in [LOC Baku  ] are generally beset by a number of government-imposed delays , such as the tax man , the fire marshal , and safety engineers battling for their own slices of the corruption pie . 
This is particularly true of smaller scale projects that do not have a " krysha " ( [MISC Russian  ] criminal slang for an official " roof , " or protector ) , such as a government minister . 
Not surprisingly , projects by [ORG Pasha Construction  ] face few , if any , of these setbacks and are generally among the fastest to be built in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] . 
Examples include the [ORG Shuvelan Shopping Center  ] , the [ORG Port Baku  ] Towers and [ORG Residences  ] , The [ORG Four Seasons Hotel  ] , the [ORG Absheron J.W. Marriott Hotel  ] and [ORG Residences  ] , and the [ORG Amburan Marriott Beach Resort  ] . 
Three workers were killed on January 11 when they fell from a building under construction on high-rent [ORG Neftchiler Prospect  ] . 
Initial media reports said this was a [ORG Pasha Construction  ] site ; within hours , retractions appeared and said it was in fact a " [ORG Geygapi Construction  ] " site . 
A [ORG First Lady  ] , Too , in [LOC Fashion  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( S ) The [PER Pashayev  ] women are known to be fashion-conscious and daring , far more so than the average woman in majority- [ORG Muslim Azerbaijan  ] . 
[ORG First Lady  ] [PER Mehriban Aliyeva  ] appears to have had substantial cosmetic surgery , presumably overseas , and wears dresses that would be considered provocative even in the [MISC Western  ] world ( reftel ) . 
On television , in photos , and in person , she appears unable to show a full range of facial expression . 
The [ORG First Lady  ] and her two daughters hosted Second [PER Lady Lynne Cheney  ] for dinner in September 2008 . 
Prior to the Second [ORG Lady  ] 's arrival , while the three ladies were waiting for [PER Mrs. Cheney  ] 's car , one [ORG Secret Service  ] agent asked " which one of those is the mother ? 
" Emboffs and [LOC White House  ] staff studied the three for several moments , and then [PER Emboff  ] said , " Well , logically the mother would probably stand in the middle . 
" Comment: [MISC Pashayevs Worth Talking  ] to ----------------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) By any measure , the [PER Pashayevs  ] are a family to be reckoned with in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] . 
[ORG First Lady  ] [PER Mehriban Aliyeva  ] has traveled to the [LOC United States  ] on multiple occasions , with her husband and separately , and been the celebrated guest at events hosted by the [ORG U.S.-Azerbaijan Chamber of Commerce  ] and other organizations . 
XXXXXXXXXXXXXX has been an important interlocutor for the [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy in [LOC Baku  ] and official [MISC Americans  ] traveling to [LOC Azerbaijan  ] . 
He has not always been able to deliver outcomes that we promote -- such as on difficult issues like the jailed bloggers -- but has been wlling to hear us out and relay those messages appopriately . 
End Comment. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) The next report on " Who [MISC Owns What  ] " will profile the [PER Heydarov  ] family . 
Patriarch [PER Kemaladdin Heydarov  ] is the Minister of [ORG Emergency Situations  ] and the former Chairman of the [ORG State Customs Committee  ] . 
A wealthy monopolist , he has been called " the most powerful man in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] , " although Post believes his family is actually second in power to that of the President and [ORG First Lady.</pre></code>  ]
