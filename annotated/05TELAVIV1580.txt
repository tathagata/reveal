Kurtzer  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) an d ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: Mossad Chief [PER Meir Dagan  ] told CODEL Corzine March 13 that [MISC Israeli  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] thinking on [LOC Iran  ] largely tracks , adding that he believes the [ORG EU  ] dialogue with [LOC Iran  ] will ultimately fail . 
[PER Dagan  ] said that [LOC Israel  ] has evidence that some foreign fighters have returned home from [LOC Iraq  ] , perhaps indicating that the tide may be starting to turn in the [LOC U.S.  ] battle against the insurgency there . 
He worried however , that these militants’ countries of origin -- in particular [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , [LOC Lebanon  ] , [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Sudan  ] -- are ill-equipped to control the returning jihadis , who might then pose a threat to stability in the region and , ultimately , to [LOC Israel  ] . 
End Summary. ---- [LOC Iran  ] ---- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Senator [PER Jon Corzine  ] , accompanied by [ORG Senate  ] staff member [PER Evan Gottesman  ] , the Ambassador , Pol/Res and [PER Poloff  ] ( notetaker ) , met with Mossad Chief [PER Meir Dagan  ] March 13 . 
Acknowledging that there are at times differences in analysis of the facts , [PER Dagan  ] stressed that it is similarities rather than differences that are at the heart of the [MISC GOI-U.S.  ] intelligence relationship , particularly on [LOC Iran  ] . 
The facts themselves are not in dispute , [PER Dagan  ] continued , adding that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Israeli  ] assessments of [MISC Iran’s  ] intentions and plans are largely in accord . 
[LOC Iran  ] has decided to go nuclear , [PER Dagan  ] said , and nothing will stop it . 
[PER Dagan  ] predicted that the [ORG EU  ] dialogue with [LOC Iran  ] will not succeed and that the issue of [MISC Iran’s  ] nuclear ambitions would eventually go to the [ORG UN Security Council.  ] ------------------------------------- [LOC Iraq  ] - Foreign Fighters Heading Home ? ------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In response to the [MISC Senator’s  ] question , [PER Dagan  ] said that the tide may be starting to turn in [LOC Iraq  ] with regard to foreign militant activity . 
[PER Dagan  ] said [LOC Israel  ] has evidence that foreign fighters originating from [LOC Tajikistan  ] , [LOC Uzbekistan  ] , [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Yemen  ] have arrived back in their home countries , and he assumes that some had returned to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] as well . 
[PER Dagan  ] predicted that , as with men who fought in [LOC Afghanistan  ] during the 80’s and 90’s , these returning militants would stay in touch with each other , forming a network based on their common experiences in [LOC Iraq.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Stressing that [LOC Israel  ] has no assets in [LOC Iraq  ] other than a friendly relationship with the [MISC Kurds  ] , [PER Dagan  ] said that Israel’s interest is more in the impact the jihadis from , for example , [LOC Jordan  ] and [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , will have once they return to their countries of origin . 
Although he predicts [LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC Jordan  ] will “do all right , ” [PER Dagan  ] said he is less confident that governments in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , [LOC Lebanon  ] , [LOC Syria  ] , and [LOC Sudan  ] are sufficiently well-equipped to face down the domestic challenge these returning militants will pose . 
The combination of their military training and the absence of strong governments willing and able to confront these men could have a devastating impact on [LOC Israel  ] by causing chaos in their home countries , he added . 
[PER Dagan  ] predicted that these jihadis will have less of a direct impact on [MISC Palestinians  ] , because [MISC Palestinians  ] are already well aware of militant views and opinions via [MISC Internet  ] chat rooms . 
Furthermore , [PER Dagan  ] said he feels that most [MISC Palestinians  ] are not searching for “foreign flags , ” such as al-Qaeda , under which to rally , because those inclined to do so are already being well-mobilized under existing groups in the [LOC West Bank  ] and [LOC Gaza.  ] ------- [LOC Lebanon  ] ------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Dagan  ] opined that [ORG Hizballah  ] will never make the transition to a purely political party in [LOC Lebanon  ] , since the organization remains very dependent on its jihadi orientation . 
Noting that even the recent [MISC Hizaballah-sponsored  ] march in [LOC Beirut  ] has not deterred the [MISC Lebanese  ] from pressing for a full [MISC Syrian  ] withdrawal , [PER Dagan  ] advised the [LOC U.S.  ] to remain firm in its demand for a complete pullout , and attributed the willingness of the [MISC Lebanese  ] people to rise up to [LOC U.S.  ] action in [LOC Iraq.  ] --------------------------------------------- ------------- Essential to Use All Assets in the [MISC Fight Against Terrorism  ] --------------------------------------------- ------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Dagan  ] said it is essential to combine all types of intelligence assets , rather than relying exclusively on human intelligence or signal intercepts , to counter terrorist threats . 
Terrorist organizations have been seeking to obtain WMD as a matter of course and , unlike countries that wish to acquire these weapons as a deterrent , non-state actors would be more inclined to actually use them , in Dagan’s opinion . 
Asked about the relationship between illicit activities such as narcotic or arms trafficking and terrorism , [PER Dagan  ] confirmed that terrorist organizations try to fund their activities by criminal means , adding that credit card fraud and counterfeiting are also methods favored by these groups . 
Weapons originating from [LOC Yemen  ] and [LOC Sudan  ] are smuggled into the territories through [LOC Egypt  ] for sale , as well as for use by militants , [PER Dagan  ] said. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 .
