( U ) The following cable has business sensitive information , please handle accordingly. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG VARIG  ] 's downward spiral continues with a recent spate of cancellations that have left passengers stranded and caused outcries from local and international creditors clamoring for GoB action . 
The company is currently [MISC USD  ] 3.3 billion in debt ( with obligations growing ) , two months behind on payments to creditors for leased aircraft , 7 months behind on payments to the national airport operator [ORG INFRAERO  ] , and will be required by [ORG Petrobras  ] subsidiary [ORG BR Distribuidora  ] to prepay for refueling . 
[ORG National Civil Aviation Agency  ] ( [ORG ANAC  ] ) representatives expressed concerns that foreign creditors will paralyze [ORG VARIG  ] 's cash-generating foreign operations with plane seizures and the loss of landing rights at foreign airports . 
[ORG VARIG  ] recently paid its most vocal foreign creditor , [ORG International Lease Finance Corporation  ] ( [ORG ILFC  ] ) , but did not pay the other 28 , fostering ill will among those left holding the bag . 
[ORG VARIG  ] has a scheduled date in [LOC U.S.  ] bankruptcy court April 20 , which will more than likely decide the company 's operating future . 
End Summary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Brazil  ] 's airport operator [ORG INFRAERO  ] stated that it can/will no longer wait for [ORG VARIG  ] to pay seven months of owed airport fees , equivalent to [MISC USD  ] 492 million . 
This is in the wake of [ORG VARIG  ] 's calls to hold off paying for another three months and despite [ORG INFRAERO  ] 's meeting with [PER Lula Chief  ] of Staff [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] . 
[ORG INFRAERO  ] is itself being pressured by the [ORG Public Ministry  ] and the [ORG Public Accounts Tribunal  ] ( [ORG GAO-equivalent  ] organ ) to collect these fees from [ORG VARIG  ] or face prosecution for favoritism . 
Similarly , [ORG Petrobras  ] subsidiary [ORG BR Distribuidora  ] , will require [ORG VARIG  ] to prepay for fuel , despite [ORG VARIG  ] 's request to delay payment for two months . 
Airline pension fund [LOC AERUS  ] , [ORG VARIG  ] 's largest single creditor at [MISC USD  ] 943 million , last week opposed a deal proposed by [ORG MatlinPatterson  ] 's local subsidiary , [ORG VOLO  ] , to purchase the airline 's operations for [MISC USD  ] 350 million . 
The new company contemplated under the [ORG VOLO  ] proposal would not assume any of [ORG VARIG  ] 's debt , including the post bankruptcy protection back payments of [MISC USD  ] 18 million to [LOC AERUS  ] . 
Acceptance of the [ORG MatlinPatterson  ] offer would have resulted in a 33 percent reduction in aircraft and a 56 per cent reduction in staff in the newly restructured entity . 
The president of [LOC AERUS  ] has since been fired , which he publicly blamed on his refusal to back the deal. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) In the meantime , [ORG VARIG  ] 's leaders are banking on its status as an " institution " to save it and will thus take another proposal to [LOC Brazil  ] 's Economic and [ORG Social Development Bank  ] ( [ORG BNDES  ] ) this week to ask for a [MISC USD  ] 200 million bridge loan until a suitable solution can be found . 
Political leaders , including the new Finance Minister [PER Guido Mantega  ] , who needs to convince financial market participants of his fiscal-restraint credential , stated that the GoB does not have the money to finance a bailout of the airline and is not in the business of using public funds to save private enterprises. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In a lunch meeting with [PER Emboffs  ] ( reftel ) , [ORG ANAC  ] Directors [PER Denise Abreu  ] and [PER Leur Lomanto  ] openly worried that their biggest problem with [ORG VARIG  ] is the takeover of [LOC Brazil  ] 's international routes of which [ORG VARIG  ] has a 69.6 percent share . 
While publicly denying that it has come up with a contingency plan for the eventuality of a [ORG VARIG  ] stoppage of service , [ORG ANAC  ] representatives told [PER Emboffs  ] that the carrier 's domestic flights could be absorbed easily . 
They pointedly questioned emboffs whether creditors like [ORG International Lease Finance Corporation  ] ( [ORG ILFC  ] ) would hold true to threats to seize [ORG VARIG  ] planes . 
( Of [ORG VARIG  ] 's 29 leasehold creditors , 19 are based in the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) A [ORG Boeing  ] contact told econoff that [ORG ILFC  ] , the most vocal and most likely to seize aircraft ( per their past actions ) had been paid the week of April <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
However , this has left the other creditors , some of whom have Letters of Intent from other carriers for the aircraft currently under lease with [ORG VARIG  ] , disgruntled . 
[ORG VARIG  ] 's post bankruptcy petition protections against plane seizures etc. were predicated on its staying current on their financial obligations . 
The [ORG Boeing  ] rep noted that now more than ever , it makes more financial sense for the leasehold creditors to move forward with plans to seize these planes for non-payment and lease them to other airlines .
