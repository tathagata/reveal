End Summary . 
[ORG Counterterrorism Cooperation  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) [ORG FBI  ] Director [PER Robert Mueller  ] met with [ORG Indian National Security Advisor M.K. Narayanan  ] March 3 to discuss counter-terrorism , law enforcement and intelligence cooperation . 
[PER Narayanan  ] began the meeting on a friendly note , describing his experience in fostering [MISC Indian  ] relations with the [ORG FBI  ] , dating back to his days in the [ORG Intelligence Bureau  ] when he was involved in getting the first [MISC Indian  ] official to do an exchange with the [ORG FBI  ] , and he even recalled a dinner both he and the Director had attended in [LOC Toronto  ] in 2001 . 
[PER Narayanan  ] emphasized that he recognized the importance of the improved counter-terrorism cooperation between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC India  ] following the November 26 attacks in [LOC Mumbai  ] , saying the pace of improving relations has been “frenetic” since then and adding that he hoped progress could be maintained . 
He stressed that what [LOC India  ] needed was more than just good liaison work between law enforcement agencies , but broader , real-time , effective cooperation , to include work between our intelligence agencies . 
[ORG LeT Threat  ] ---------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) While acknowledging that most of the world considered al [PER Qaeda  ] to be the largest terrorist threat , [PER Narayanan  ] said that [LOC India  ] was obsessed with [ORG Lashkar-e-Tayyiba  ] ( [ORG LeT  ] ) , noting that the [ORG LeT  ] was now in over 20 countries and had a global reach . 
He stated that “there are signs” that another attack on [LOC India  ] is being planned , but said the [ORG GOI  ] did not have any information on where such an attack would take place or how it would take place . 
Citing the attack earlier in the day on the [MISC Sri Lankan  ] cricket team traveling in [LOC Lahore  ] , the [ORG National Security Advisor  ] described the ease with which recent attacks have taken place in public , and agreed with the Director on the need for intelligence to uncover attacks in advance . 
Terrorists - Changing Demographics ---------------------------------- NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00000412 002 OF 003 <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) [PER Narayanan  ] said he “entirely agreed” with the [MISC Director’s  ] assertion that as [LOC India  ] constructs its counter-terrorism institutions , it must integrate law enforcement and intelligence functions , and Director [PER Mueller  ] offered [LOC U.S.  ] assistance in helping [LOC India  ] build its counter-terror capabilities . 
[PER Narayanan  ] described several recent cases of interrogations the [ORG GOI  ] had conducted , including that of the lone surviving [LOC Mumbai  ] terrorist suspect , [PER Mohammad Kasab  ] , which yielded both law enforcement and intelligence information . 
He then described a changing trend in terrorists being recruited to jihad , saying that while in the past [MISC Kashmiri  ] terrorist recruits were vulnerable because they were economically disadvantaged , any of today’s terrorists were professionals who came from well-to-do backgrounds . 
[LOC India  ] , with its vast [MISC Muslim  ] community living side-by-side with [MISC Hindus  ] , was having difficulty identifying the sources of radicalization , he explained , adding that even [MISC Muslim  ] leaders [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] were confessing they were “losing control of their flock.” [LOC India  ] is also seeing the beginnings of [MISC Hindu  ] extremist groups that use violence , he said , agreeing with the [MISC Director’s  ] point that terrorists come from more than just [MISC Muslim  ] backgrounds . 
Pakistan: The Source --------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) Referring to [LOC Pakistan  ] , [PER Narayanan  ] said [LOC India  ] was “next to the epicenter of today’s terrorism problem.” Offering his advice to the Director for his trip to [LOC Pakistan  ] the following day , [PER Narayanan  ] lamented that nearly every major attack on [LOC India  ] had come from [LOC Pakistan  ] , yet despite numerous promises from [MISC Pakistani  ] officials over the years to not allow terrorism to emanate from its soil , the problem is worse than ever . 
He urged Director [PER Mueller  ] to keep the pressure on [LOC Pakistan  ] to prosecute terrorists and dismantle their infrastructure , saying “if you want to end malaria you have to get rid of the swamp.” [PER Narayanan  ] acknowledged progress which had been made at times in the past , particularly just prior to President Musharraf’s downfall , but said [LOC India  ] remains disappointed with the results . 
He specifically cited the Joint Anti-Terror Mechanism ( [ORG JATM  ] ) , which the two countries had established -- despite a lack of popular support for it in [LOC India  ] -- as being unproductive , blaming the [MISC Pakistanis  ] for not following through on information [LOC India  ] provided . 
In the end , [PER Narayanan  ] maintained , [LOC Pakistan  ] will need to fight terrorism for its own purposes , or it will implode . 
India’s interest was not , as one might think , in [ORG Pakistan’s  ] demise , but rather in a stable [LOC Pakistan  ] ; “When we say we want a stable [LOC Pakistan  ] , it’s enlightened self-interest , ” he said . 
Given [MISC America’s  ] experience in dealing with 9/11 , [PER Narayanan  ] felt the [LOC U.S.  ] should be able to convince [LOC Pakistan  ] that if it doesn’t deal with terrorism , it won’t last . 
[ORG Narayanan: No Joint Investigation  ] of [LOC Mumbai  ] Attacks Now --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) Responding to the [MISC Director’s  ] comment that [LOC Islamabad  ] was seeking a joint investigation of the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks , [PER Narayanan  ] dismissed the idea , saying the timing is not right given the levels of suspicion [LOC India  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] have for each other . 
He referred again to the [ORG JATM  ] , saying it had been designed to serve as a vehicle for the sharing of information , but hadn’t worked that way . 
[PER Narayanan  ] felt [LOC Pakistan  ] could conduct its own investigation , asserting that if the government is not complicit with the terrorists , it should want to investigate and prosecute those responsible . 
As [LOC India  ] gets “two to three” intercepts per day on possible terrorist activity , the [ORG National Security Advisor  ] added that the joint investigation the [MISC Pakistanis  ] were offering should be across the board , and not just in response to [LOC Mumbai  ] , but [LOC India  ] felt it couldn’t share that information at this time . 
Rather than joint investigations , [PER Narayanan  ] encouraged the [LOC U.S.  ] to continue to play the role of honest broker in the [LOC Mumbai  ] investigation . 
In response to the [MISC Director’s  ] suggestion that perhaps [LOC India  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] could send investigators to [LOC Washington  ] to work together , rather than in [LOC India  ] , [PER Narayanan  ] said he could consider it , NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00000412 003 OF 003 “but at this point both sides are so suspicious of each other that to say [LOC India  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] could have an honest joint investigation is difficult.” [PER Narayanan  ] acknowledged that India’s upcoming general elections -- and more specifically , the politics surrounding them -- would affect the government’s ability to cooperate with [LOC Pakistan  ] , and said it would be “unpalatable” for the government to agree to a joint investigation at this time. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) [PER Narayanan  ] ended the meeting by describing [ORG ISI  ] as being the root cause of terrorism in [LOC Pakistan  ] , and said that in order to effectively address the problem [ORG ISI  ] would need to be seriously reformed . 
The [LOC United States  ] has done a lot to pressure [ORG ISI  ] , [PER Narayanan  ] opined , particularly the agency’s leadership , however , the current [ORG ISI  ] -- and its [LOC Pakistan  ] Army leadership would not be capable of sufficient reforms by itself . 
He argued that lower levels of the organization , who often support terrorist attacks without their superiors’ knowledge , would also need to be addressed .
