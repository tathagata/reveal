( C ) Summary . 
As it prepares for [LOC Copenhagen  ] , the [ORG EU  ] is reliving many of the arguments that plagued it during negotiations of the [ORG Climate and Energy Package  ] last year . 
At a recent [ORG EU  ] Energy and [ORG Environment Ministers  ] meeting , [LOC Poland  ] is leading what appears to be the same group of [LOC Central  ] and [MISC Eastern European Member States  ] in opposing the concept that they should pay for reducing carbon emissions in developing countries with much larger GDPs , notably [LOC China  ] . 
Despite indications that internal questions had been settled , the economic recession is exacerbating the divisions among [ORG Member States  ] . 
Additionally , in working toward the [ORG EU  ] , s emissions reduction target , now 20% from 1990 levels in 2020 but with the possibility of going to 30% with " comparable " efforts from other developed countries , the [ORG EU  ] has painted itself into a corner , both potentially forcing it to make increasingly painful reductions and making it next to impossible for the [ORG EU  ] to commit to anything more than 30% . 
It will use its offer to go to 30% as a negotiating tactic so it can justify its actions to its citizens and its companies . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) During negotiations in 2008 on the [ORG EU  ] , s [ORG Climate and Energy Package  ] , [LOC Poland  ] formed a coalition with eight other new [ORG Member States  ] to gain concessions during the final drafting to account for emissions reductions during the 1990s and the possible threats to economic growth . 
Now , in debating how the [ORG EU  ] will approach the [ORG UN  ] climate change negotiations , [LOC Europe  ] is seeing a repeat of the 2008 divisions . 
A [MISC Finnish  ] delegate indicated to [LOC USEU EconOff  ] on the margins of the July 23-25 informal Energy and [ORG Climate Ministers  ] meeting in Are , [LOC Sweden  ] that the [ORG EU  ] , s effort is suffering from a repeat of last year , and several [ORG Member States  ] are very upset that the actions of some are " holding the [ORG EU  ] hostage . 
" [LOC Germany  ] is concerned that a lack of internal solidarity is leading to problems with the [ORG EU  ] , s position and leadership internationally . 
A [MISC German  ] delegate stated that [LOC Poland  ] , s argument thus far can be summed up to " give us two billion euros for technology . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The main issue is that some [ORG Member States  ] have a problem with the increased burden placed upon them in addition to that of the [ORG Climate and Energy Package  ] . 
A [MISC Polish  ] delegate argued that the new [ORG Member States  ] are at a disadvantage and to catch up with the rest of the [ORG EU  ] , they will need to move faster than anyone globally , simply under the terms of the [ORG Climate and Energy Package  ] . 
A [MISC Latvian  ] delegate explained that even in [LOC Latvia  ] , with its high proportion of renewable energy and its effort to move farther , it is not a wealthy country and should not be asked to pay for [LOC China  ] and [LOC India  ] . 
As a result , during the internal discussion on how to share the burden of [ORG EU  ] mitigation and financing efforts , a [MISC Slovakian  ] official explained that the coalition formed during the [ORG Climate and Energy Package  ] is forming an alternative position to the major [MISC Western European Member States  ] . 
According to the [MISC Polish  ] delegate , this will allow a real discussion as to how to address historical responsibility , in which early efforts by the new [ORG Member States--beyond  ] [MISC post-Soviet  ] deindustrialization--can be taken into account . 
This will also allow [LOC Poland  ] and others to defend their use of coal , expected to be for the long-term and not accepted by many in the [ORG EU  ] , on energy security grounds. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Beyond the formation of the opposition bloc , few other decisions have been made , most notably on the move from 20% to 30% . 
[MISC Swedish  ] Environment Minister [PER Andreas Carlgren  ] , supported by Environment Commissioner [PER Stavros Dimas  ] , publicly stated in re that there is " broad agreement " in the [ORG EU  ] to push towards an ambitious [LOC Copenhagen  ] agreement that allows for the [ORG EU  ] to move to 30% . 
However , internally , there are divisions , including how to define comparability . 
A [MISC Slovakian  ] delegate argued that 20% is still the current formal position , and divisions remain as to if and how to move to 30% and under what conditions . 
A [MISC French  ] delegate was more subtle and explained that moving from 20% to 30% is not a fundamental problem , but the [ORG EU  ] will not make the decision until [LOC Copenhagen  ] . 
By contrast , a [MISC Norwegian  ] delegate explained that the [ORG EU  ] has positioned itself politically based on the " inevitable " move to 30% , that it would be impossible to avoid its commitment to 30% . 
The [ORG EU  ] will thus use 30% as a negotiating tactic to move others to stronger commitments , so that it can justify its own decision to move to 30% to its citizens and companies , who are arguing that the [ORG EU  ] should not go farther until other developed countries follow . 
( Note: [LOC Norway  ] , while not a member of the [ORG EU  ] , is a part of the [MISC Emissions Trading Scheme  ] ( [ORG ETS  ] ) , and is thus privy to internal discussions . 
End note .

( C ) The [ORG EU  ] has made few other decisions related to financing . 
[LOC Poland  ] and [LOC Latvia  ] , among others , continue to argue that the GDP per capita of many [ORG Member States  ] is less than that of [LOC China  ] , and thus they should not be asked to pay . 
However , [MISC Western European Member States  ] are more concerned at the moment as to how to develop a framework for financing . 
A [MISC German  ] delegate explained that [LOC Germany  ] would like the [ORG EU  ] to be more concrete on a financing framework , but should not present a concrete number until much later . 
According to the delegate , this framework should be based on efforts by developing countries , a sentiment echoed by [PER Carlgren  ] when during a press conference , he repeated the [ORG EU  ] mantra of " no money , no deal , " adding to it " no actions , no money . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Comment . 
Unsurprisingly , the [ORG EU  ] remains undecided , and in some cases , divided , as to how it will approach the final months of the [ORG UN  ] negotiations . 
The [MISC Swedish  ] Presidency claims these issues will be worked out by the end of October , when Finance and Environment Ministers meet back to back in [LOC Brussels  ] on October 20-21 , followed by the [MISC European  ] Coucil of Heads of State on October 29-30 . 
It i likely that [LOC Poland  ] , using its bloc of [LOC EasternMember States  ] , will continue to press for conessions internally , much as it did during negotiations last year . 
While it is not yet clear how these internal debates will play out , it is likely some concessions will be made so the [ORG EU  ] can present a unified position in the international negotiations . 
The [ORG EU  ] is so concerned that it maintain its leadership position , it will likely work rapidly to address the concerns of these [ORG Member States  ] , although doing so will either raise the pain for the [MISC Western  ] [ORG EU  ] members or dilute the [ORG EU  ] , s claim to lead internationally .
