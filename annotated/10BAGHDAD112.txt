( C ) SUMMARY: Ambassador [PER Taha Shukr Abbassi  ] , the head of the [MISC Iraqi  ] MFA 's Neighboring Countries' division ( A/S equivalent ) , made the following comments regarding [MISC Iranian  ] FM [ORG Mottaki  ] 's visit and the recent oil field dispute between [LOC Iraq  ] and Iran: ( 1 ) [ORG Mottaki  ] promised to fully withdraw [MISC Iranian  ] soldiers from the disputed oil field ( ref A ) and pressed the [ORG GOI  ] to conduct joint surveys of the [MISC Iran-Iraq  ] border ; ( 2 ) the [MISC Iranians  ] have not yet withdrawn their soldiers ; ( 3 ) [ORG GOI  ] technical survey teams will begin their work once [MISC Iranian  ] soldiers fully withdraw ; ( 3 ) the incident has tarnished [LOC Iran  ] 's standing among many [MISC Iraqi  ] Shi'a supporters ; ( 4 ) the [ORG GOI  ] does not recognize the 1975 [ORG Algiers Accord  ] governing border issues and would like to negotiate a new or amended agreement with [LOC Iran  ] ; ( 5 ) [LOC Iran  ] , unlike [LOC Turkey  ] , is slow in fulfilling its promises and implementing bilateral agreements ; and ( 6 ) [LOC Iraq  ] recognizes the need to proceed patiently and diplomatically in its dealing with [LOC Iran  ] to ensure a peaceful outcome to these and other disputes . 
END SUMMARY . 
[MISC Iranian  ] Troops Still Present ---------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On January 13 , Ambassador [PER Taha Shukr Abbassi  ] met with Post 's Deputy Political Counselor and Senior [LOC Iran  ] Watcher to discuss FM [ORG Mottaki  ] 's recent visit in light of the [LOC Fakka  ] oil field incident . 
[PER Abbassi  ] , a career diplomat who has had extensive dealings with the [MISC Iranians  ] , confirmed that FM [ORG Mottaki  ] pressed the [ORG GOI  ] during his visit to resume the work of a technical committee tasked with conducting joint surveys along the [MISC Iran-Iraq  ] border , including the maritime border . 
FM [ORG Mottaki  ] offered assurances of [MISC Iranian  ] troop withdrawal from the disputed oil field ; however , the continued presence of [MISC Iranian  ] troops called into question [LOC Iran  ] 's willingness to deliver on its promises , [PER Abbassi  ] complained . 
He added that the [MISC Iranian  ] incursion has undermined [LOC Iran  ] 's standing among many [MISC Iraqi  ] Shi'a supporters , who viewed the dispute as nothing more than typical [MISC Iranian  ] aggression and interference in [MISC Iraqi  ] affairs. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Abbassi  ] criticized [ORG Mottaki  ] for failing to keep his promise and said the work of the two [ORG GOI  ] technical teams ( land and water ) would only begin once all [MISC Iranian  ] troops have fully withdrawn from the disputed area . 
[PER Abbassi  ] asserted that the work of the committees " will take years to complete " given the complexity of the terrain and the security risks posed by landmines that are scattered along the border areas since the [MISC Iran-Iraq  ] war . 
Senior MFA Advisor [PER Mohammed al-Haj Hamoud  ] told [ORG DCM  ] the same day that the [MISC Iraqis  ] had been ready to allow the working groups to start their work , even with the less-than-complete [MISC Iranian  ] border , " We're only talking about a 100 meters or so and the border area is admittedly undefined , " but then the [MISC Iranians  ] moved in high-powered lights and a small piece of artillery . 
Following that , FM [MISC Zebari  ] had ordered the teams to stand down at present , said [PER Haj Hamoud  ] , adding that an additional " partial withdrawal , a gesture " might be enough to get the work back on track . 
( NOTE: [ORG USG  ] satellite imagery confirms the continued presence of [MISC Iranian  ] troops approximately 75-100 meters inside [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Imagery has also captured what appears to be [MISC Iranian  ] construction activity , including the [MISC Qto  ] be [MISC Iranian  ] construction activity , including the establishment of a small building near the troop outpost . 
END NOTE ) [LOC Iran  ] Not As [MISC Reliable As  ] [LOC Turkey  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Describing [LOC Iran  ] 's intransigence as usual [MISC Iranian  ] stubbornness and inefficiency when it comes to implementing agreements , [PER Abbassi  ] said that over a year ago , he personally presented [ORG Mottaki  ] with a non-paper proposing a new way forward on [MISC Iraq-Iran  ] relations , focusing largely on bilateral issues such as borders , maritime rights , natural resources , etc . 
The paper was intended to wipe the slate clean for both countries , who technically remain in a state of war following the cessation of hostilities in 1988 . 
" We have not heard back regarding the paper , " [PER Abbassi  ] lamented . 
" The [MISC Iranians  ] still feel that they are dealing with the same [LOC Iraq  ] that [PER Saddam  ] dominated for so long . 
But we are a very different country now , " [PER Abbassi  ] said in trying to explain lingering [MISC Iranian  ] suspicions about [ORG GOI  ] intentions . 
In comparison , [PER Abbassi  ] [LOC BAGHDAD  ] 00000112 002 OF 002 applauded the efficiency of the [MISC Turkish  ] government in its dealings with [LOC Iraq  ] , stating that " [LOC Turkey  ] is very good at following-up and keeping promises . 
" [ORG Algiers Accord  ] Obsolete ----------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Abbassi  ] commented that the [ORG GOI  ] does not accept or formally recognize the 1975 [ORG Algiers Accord  ] that was signed between then-Vice President [PER Saddam Hussein  ] and the [MISC Shah of  ] [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Abbassi  ] noted that [PER Saddam  ] himself literally tore up the agreement during the war with [LOC Iran  ] and that no current or future [MISC Iraqi  ] parliament would ratify the agreement in its present form . 
( NOTE: The agreement was ratified under [MISC Iraqi  ] President al-Bakr 's government and subsequently registered with the [ORG UN  ] . 
END NOTE . 
) According to [PER Abbassi  ] , the [ORG GOI  ] would welcome a new or amended agreement that takes into account existing political and geographic realities , notably with the [LOC Shatt-al-Arab  ] waterway since 1975 . 
However , the [MISC Iranians  ] are reluctant to renegotiate because they fear losing territory and waters claimed in the [LOC Shatt al-Arab  ] , which a new demarcation would likely not recognize , [PER Abbassi  ] said . 
( NOTE: Despite repeated condemnation of the [ORG Algiers Accord  ] by numerous [ORG GOI  ] officials , the [ORG GOI  ] has never made use of any of the dispute resolution mechanisms contained in the agreement , nor made any attempt to legally terminate the agreement . 
END NOTE . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Abbassi  ] asked about what military support , if any , the [ORG USG  ] would be obliged or willing to provide to [LOC Iraq  ] under the [ORG Security Agreement  ] in the event of future aggression by any of its neighbors . 
He also encouraged greater [ORG USG  ] public statements condemning [MISC Iranian  ] aggression as a violation of international law in order to demonstrate to the [MISC Iraqi  ] public the [ORG USG  ] 's moral support for [LOC Iraq  ] 's territorial integrity . 
[PER Abbassi  ] underscored that [LOC Iraq  ] 's relations with [LOC Iran  ] will require patience and diplomacy given historic grievances and lingering suspicions . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Water and border disputes will continue to define [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] 's broader bilateral agenda as [LOC Iraq  ] regains its political footing and maturity . 
[LOC Iran  ] 's reluctance ( and discomfort ) in dealing with [LOC Iraq  ] as an equal partner on sensitive issues of broader public concern ( water rights , borders , trade ) are likely to further erode [ORG GOI  ] and [MISC Iraqi  ] public confidence in their closest neighbor 's intentions and " goodwill " . 
[PER Abbassi  ] 's comments highlight the challenges he and other technocrats face in their dealings with [LOC Iran  ] . 
It is also increasingly apparent that both sides realize that their bilateral dealings are driven less by a shared Shi'a heritage and more by real-world priorities and diverging interests.</pre></code>
