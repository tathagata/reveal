[ORG SAO PAULO  ] 247 Classified By: Consul General [PER Thomas White  ] ; reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: During a June 13 meeting with the Ambassador , former [ORG Minister of Finance Antonio  ] [PER Delfim Netto  ] ( strictly protect ) , who is currently working as a political and business consultant and widely believed to be an unofficial advisor to President [PER Lula  ] , discussed his views on [LOC Brazil  ] 's newfound oil reserves . 
[PER Delfim Netto  ] did not see any strong desire on the part of the [ORG GOB  ] to nationalize existing fields or to substantially change the rules governing concessions ( Ref A ) . 
Instead , [PER Delfim Netto  ] indicated that the [ORG GOB  ] would support a continuation of the concession framework but indicated that royalties would increase . 
He stated that the [ORG GOB  ] ( through the [ORG National Energy Petroleum Council  ] ) would maintain existing royalty agreements for all fields currently under production , and that the [ORG National Petroleum Agency  ] ( [ORG ANP  ] ) would open bidding for the exploration rights on the new reserves to foreign competition . 
[PER Delfim Netto  ] told the Ambassador that foreign investment would be necessary to finance development of these reservoirs to ensure near term production . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In a meeting on June 13 with the Ambassador , [PER Delfim Netto  ] said that the [ORG GOB  ] and [ORG Petrobras  ] do not share the same goals for developing reserves from the newfound deep-water petroleum discoveries . 
Many energy insiders believe [ORG Petrobras  ] is stalling the bidding process in order to pull together the financial resources to win concessions for many of the pre-salt oil blocks that had been removed from the ninth round of oil block auctions in November 2007 ( Refs B and C ) . 
( [ORG Note: Petrobras  ] was privatized in 1997 and 63 percent of the company is now publicly traded on the [ORG NYSE  ] and [ORG Bovespa  ] . 
End Note . 
) [PER Delfim Netto  ] confirmed that the [ORG GOB  ] wanted to move forward on the exploration of these reserves and that its goals and those of [ORG Petrobras  ] have diverged. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Despite the public rumors regarding changes to and potential abolishment of the concession model , [PER Delfim Netto  ] told the Ambassador that [LOC Brazil  ] would keep the same concession model , but could increase the percent of royalties charged for the new reserves ( Ref A ) ; with which he agreed . 
He added that he supported charging [ORG Petrobras  ] royalties . 
He told the Ambassador that he promoted the idea that [ORG Petrobras  ] open up the energy market and that the [ORG GOB  ] realizes it would be a necessary condition to finance the exploration of the new reserves. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Likewise , [PER Delfim Netto  ] acknowledged that [ORG Petrobras  ] was also a potential obstacle on biofuels issues . 
Given the inherent conflict of interest for [ORG Petrobras  ] to manage bio-fuels initiatives , [PER Delfim Netto  ] told the Ambassador that [ORG Petrobras  ] should and would be " removed from the equation . 
" When asked if the [ORG GOB  ] would support a spin-off of the [ORG Biofuels Unit  ] within [ORG Petrobras  ] , [PER Delfim Netto  ] thought it was assured. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) At the Ambassador 's suggestion of high-level meetings between the two governments , [PER Delfim Netto  ] said he estimated that it would take 30 to 60 days for the [ORG GOB  ] to solidify a new concession and royalty framework , and that after that point he believed [ORG USG  ] engagement would be welcome. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) COMMENT: [PER Delfim Netto  ] 's analysis of the divergence of interests between [ORG Petrobras  ] and the [ORG GOB  ] bears watching . 
Given the recent negative history of [LOC Bolivia  ] 's privatizations , it seems unlikely that the [ORG GOB  ] would abandon the concession model and even more unlikely that it would choose to change the rules on existing concessions . 
Political and economic stability have been the cornerstones of [LOC Brazil  ] 's policies and largely led to [LOC Brazil  ] obtaining investment grade status ( Ref D ) . 
While some modification of exploration and concession rules may take place for these new " mega fields " , it is doubtful the [ORG GOB  ] would do anything to undermine the overall image of [LOC Brazil  ] as a stable country in which to invest. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Unlike [PER Delfim Netto  ] 's view that the [ORG USG  ] should hold off on intervening to establish these new rules , [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Ministry of Mines and Energy  ] , regulators , and [ORG US  ] energy companies have suggested that it could instead be within this period for the [ORG USG  ] to intervene . 
Indeed , [ORG Petrobras'  ] interest in consolidating deep-sea drilling in the [LOC Gulf  ] of [LOC Mexico  ] and vertical integration in the [ORG US  ] market could open an important window of opportunity for the [ORG USG  ] . 
Furthermore , [ORG ANP  ] has expressed interest in learning more about [ORG US  ] small and medium sized energy companies operating in [LOC US  ] states to develop a similar capacity in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
They have , in fact , asked for [ORG USG  ] assistance to travel to the [ORG US  ] to meet with and further learn about this important part of the energy equation . 
Clearly , [LOC Brazil  ] 's energy sector offers new partnerships , opportunities , and increased energy security for the [ORG US  ] . 
As [LOC Brazil  ] begins to increase exploration of its newfound " pre-salt " reserves that many believe could be larger than the finds in the [LOC North Sea  ] , the [ORG US  ] could potentially capitalize on these new technologies to develop our own offshore exploration efforts . 
Early engagement may be crucial to ensuring that [ORG US  ] firms will have opportunities in this market . 
END COMMENT .
