( U ) Participants: [LOC U.S.  ] Deputy Secretary [ORG Steinberg  ] Ambassador [PER William Brownfield DAS Christopher McMullen  ] , [ORG WHA  ] DCM [PER Brian Nichols  ] USAID Mission Director [PER Ken Yamashita Political Counselor Mark Wells  ] ( notetaker ) NAS Director [PER Dan Foote Economic Counselor Tim Stater D  ] ( S ) Special Assistant [PER Lourdes Cue Control Officer Marcos Mandojana COLOMBIA  ] President [PER Alvaro Uribe Foreign Minister Jaime Bermudez Minister  ] of [ORG Defense Gabriel Silva  ] Minister of [LOC Commerce  ] , [ORG Industry & Tourism  ] Luis [PER Guillermo Plata Ambassador  ] to the [LOC United States Carolina Barco Accion Social  ] ( [ORG GOC  ] development agency ) Director [PER Diego Molano High Commissioner  ] for Peace and Reintegration [PER Frank Pearl Vice Minister  ] of [ORG Defense Jorge Mario Eastman MFA North America Desk  ] [PER Adriana Maldonado  ] ( notetaker ) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: Deputy Secretary [ORG Steinberg  ] met with President [PER Uribe  ] and his key ministers for nearly three hours , discussing a range of bilateral and regional issues . 
[PER Uribe  ] detailed the advances in security , education , economic and social indicators , and trade during his administration but said that [LOC Colombia  ] could not finish the job without continued strong [LOC U.S.  ] support . 
He hoped to bring an end to the armed conflict in [LOC Colombia  ] through demobilization and social programs , but judged that the [ORG Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia  ] ( [ORG FARC  ] ) would never negotiate as long as it enjoyed a safe haven in [LOC Venezuela  ] coupled with a steady income from drug trafficking . 
Deputy [ORG Steinberg  ] reassured [PER Uribe  ] that [LOC U.S.  ] counter-narcotics efforts would remain a core element of assistance , noting that it was essential to address [LOC Colombia  ] 's broader problems . 
[PER Uribe  ] agreed on the need for prudence in dealing with the bellicose statements of President [PER Hugo Chavez  ] but asked for intelligence-sharing on [MISC Colombian  ] terrorist groups hiding-out in [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
[PER Uribe  ] said that coca cultivation results in the destruction of [MISC Colombian  ] rainforests and thus climate change , and sought support for his [ORG Forest Ranger Family  ] program to protect rainforests . 
The Deputy noted concerns about impunity and human rights . 
He reiterated [LOC U.S.  ] support for moving forward with the [ORG U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement  ] ( [ORG FTA  ] ) at an appropriate time , and urged continued work on sensitive labor issues for when the [ORG U.S. Congress  ] is ready to vote . 
END SUMMARY. ------------------- Ending the Conflict ------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) After a 20-minute one-on-one meeting with President [PER Uribe  ] , the Deputy Secretary opened the larger meeting by praising the " great partnership " between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Colombia  ] . 
He cited [ORG Plan Colombia  ] 's " positive but incomplete " results , calling for more effort to consolidate [LOC Colombia  ] 's security gains through reduced poverty and more equitable income distribution . 
The Deputy asked [PER Uribe  ] his views for ending the 45-year-old conflict with the [ORG FARC  ] and [ORG National Liberation Army  ] ( [ORG ELN  ] ) . <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Uribe  ] recounted his and his predecessors' attempts to initiate peace processes with both terrorist organizations . 
He cited the [ORG GOC  ] 's success in facilitating the demobilization of more than 52,000 guerrillas and paramilitaries during his presidency . 
He outlined the [ORG GOC  ] 's poverty-reduction and land restitution programs aimed at increasing social cohesion and thereby undermining the terrorists' appeal . 
[PER Uribe  ] lamented that the Constitution of 1991 prohibited amnesty for perpetrators of crimes against humanity , which he claimed greatly restricted the [ORG GOC  ] 's ability to negotiate a peace agreement like that reached with [ORG M-19  ] in the late 1980s . 
He also lamented that the [ORG GOC  ] had failed to prevent the assassination of the Governor of Caqueta by the [ORG FARC  ] in December. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Uribe  ] concluded that the [ORG FARC  ] and [ORG ELN  ] 's willingness to talk were hampered by the fountain of wealth from narco-trafficking ( which makes them self-sufficient , unlike the past conflict in [LOC El Salvador  ] ) and the prospect of safe haven in [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
[PER Uribe  ] said [PER Chavez'  ] support of the guerrillas had frustrated further [ORG GOC  ] military progress against them . 
The President accepted that [LOC U.S.  ] security assistance had decreased in recent years , but urged the [LOC United States  ] not to back down in what was a " winnable battle . 
" Deputy [ORG Steinberg  ] reassured [PER Uribe  ] that [LOC U.S.  ] counter-narcotics efforts would remain a core element of assistance , noting that it was essential to address [LOC Colombia  ] 's broader problems. ---------------------------- [ORG Paramilitaries & Reparations  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Deputy [ORG Steinberg  ] asked how the [ORG GOC  ] was addressing the growing threat of criminal groups whose membership includes former paramilitaries . 
[PER Uribe  ] said the state had successfully recovered the monopolies on justice and security once held by the paramilitary and guerrilla groups , noting significant reductions in terrorist attacks , murders and kidnappings . 
Commissioner [PER Pearl  ] downplayed the role of paramilitaries in emerging criminal groups , citing a [MISC Colombian  ] [ORG National Police  ] ( [ORG CNP  ] ) estimate that former paramilitaries comprised just 12% of the new groups' memberships . 
[PER Pearl  ] explained that this means there is a recidivism rate of only 7.4% among the demobilized paramilitaries. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Asked about the backlog of reparations for victims , [PER Uribe  ] declared that the most effective reparation was ending violence . 
[PER Molano  ] offered that the [ORG GOC  ] budget for administrative reparations was increasing to $150 million in 2010 and would benefit 15,000 of the 275,000 victims currently registered under the Justice and Peace Law ( JPL ) . 
[PER Uribe  ] reported that the [ORG GOC  ] had just made a decision to confiscate more assets from former paramilitaries for use in reparations. ----------------- Reducing Impunity ----------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Deputy [ORG Steinberg  ] expressed concern over the persistently high rates of impunity , noting especially the release just days earlier of several soldiers accused of extrajudicial executions ( [MISC EJEs  ] , presenting murders by state security forces as deaths in combat ) . 
He also asked about a backlog of human rights cases waiting to be transferred from military to civilian courts . 
[PER Uribe  ] said the [ORG GOC  ] had made the decision in 2005 to transfer automatically all human rights cases involving the military to the civilian justice system , where prosecutors decide whether to investigate the case further or refer it back to the military justice system . 
Minister of [ORG Defense Silva  ] asserted that due to military reforms , EJE complaints had declined from 143 in 2006 to 2 in 2009 , according to a leading [MISC Colombian  ] [ORG NGO  ] . 
While [PER Uribe  ] assured the Deputy Secretary of his commitment to eliminate [MISC EJEs  ] , he also vowed to defend the military against " false allegations " of wrongdoing . 
The Deputy Secretary urged [LOC Colombia  ] to follow through on the [ORG Universal Performance Review  ] initiated in 2008 at the [ORG UN Human Rights Council  ] as a means of developing international and domestic confidence in its commitment to human rights. ---------------------- Working with Neighbors ---------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S/NF ) Turning to [LOC Ecuador  ] , the Deputy solicited ideas for how the [LOC United States  ] could support further rapprochement between the two countries . 
[PER Uribe  ] raised the sensitivities caused by [MISC Ecuadorian  ] legal indictments of former Minister of [ORG Defense Juan Manuel Santos  ] and [MISC Colombian  ] military commanders over the March 1 , 2008 , bombing of a [ORG FARC  ] camp in [LOC Ecuador  ] . 
Foreign Minister [PER Bermudez  ] said the [ORG GOC  ] was trying to build confidence with [LOC Ecuador  ] through social projects along the border . 
On [LOC Venezuela  ] , [PER Uribe  ] advised " verbal prudence , " publicly ignoring [PER Chavez  ] to minimize the justification for his attacks . 
[PER Uribe  ] cautioned , however , that [PER Chavez  ] was " dangerous " in that he might seek to distract attention from [LOC Venezuela  ] 's growing social and economic problems by fighting with [LOC Colombia  ] . 
[PER Uribe  ] thanked the [LOC United States  ] for sharing intelligence on the activities of terrorist groups in [LOC Venezuela  ] and urged continued cooperation. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The Deputy Secretary commended [LOC Colombia  ] for building security partnerships with [LOC Mexico  ] and others in the region ( reftel ) . 
He viewed this type of cooperation as an alternative to [LOC Venezuela  ] 's [ORG ALBA  ] agreement and called for more positive opportunities for working with other like-minded countries in the region . 
He cited the Pathways to Prosperity initiative as a more hopeful model for cooperation. --------------------------------- [ORG Coca Cultivation & Climate Change  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( SBU ) Echoing his statements at the [ORG UN General Assembly  ] and the [LOC Copenhagen  ] climate change summit , President [PER Uribe  ] linked cocaine production and drug trafficking with deforestation . 
Replacing rainforest with coca crops harms the environment , and narco-trafficking is not only a problem for [LOC Colombia  ] but for its neighbors as well . 
[PER Uribe  ] highlighted [LOC Colombia  ] 's " Family Forest Warden " program , which pays approximately 90,000 families not to cultivate coca and to supervise the recuperation of destroyed forest . 
The President suggested that a variation of the program could be launched with [LOC U.S.  ] cooperation and become an essential tool for protecting [LOC Colombia  ] 's jungles and forests. -------------------- [ORG Free Trade Agreement  ] -------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Trade Minister [PER Plata  ] pressed the Deputy Secretary on passage of the [ORG FTA  ] . 
He noted that several of [LOC Colombia  ] 's neighbors that produce the same types of products now enjoy [ORG FTAs  ] ( [ORG NAFTA  ] , [LOC Chile  ] , [LOC Peru  ] ) with the [LOC United States  ] , placing [LOC Colombia  ] at a disadvantage . 
Furthermore , he said non-passage of the [MISC U.S.-Colombia  ] [ORG FTA  ] had blocked completion of [ORG FTAs  ] with [LOC Canada  ] and the [ORG European Union  ] because others were waiting to see how the sensitive labor and human rights issues would be resolved . 
[PER Plata  ] argued that the embargo imposed by [LOC Venezuela  ] had already caused a 30% drop in [MISC Colombian  ] exports in 2009 and would probably deepen to 50% in 2010 . 
He concluded that [LOC Colombia  ] cannot win with soldiers alone ; [LOC Colombia  ] needs economic opportunities to advance . 
[PER Uribe  ] added that many investors are awaiting [ORG FTA  ] approval before committing to [LOC Colombia  ] . 
He said in past years [LOC Colombia  ] could afford to wait on the additional economic activity that the [ORG FTA  ] would generate given the [ORG GOC  ] budget surplus . 
He lamented that [LOC Colombia  ] would have " much narrower fiscal room " in 2010. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Deputy [ORG Steinberg  ] responded that President [PER Obama  ] and the Secretary were aware of the need to pass the [ORG FTA  ] , and further explained the problems posed by the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Congress'  ] legislative calendar and elections cycle . 
He noted that health care reform has taken longer than expected . 
He urged the [ORG GOC  ] to continue working with the USG on labor violence issues and working conditions to " have everything lined up " when [ORG Congress  ] is prepared to take up the [ORG FTA  ] . 
He acknowledged that the goal should not be unanimous support , but that both governments must present the best case possible to maximize the chance for success. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( U ) Deputy Secretary [PER Steinberg  ] cleared this cable .
