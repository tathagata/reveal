[LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] MEETINGS -------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Amb  ] . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] began by thanking [ORG AbZ  ] for hosting the well-timed [ORG SRAP  ] meeting in [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] on January 12 . 
[ORG AbZ  ] said he was looking forward to the [LOC Gulf  ] participation , including that of the [MISC Jordanian  ] Foreign Minister , particularly following the recent attack in [LOC Khost  ] . 
[ORG AbZ  ] said [PER Judeh  ] had told him [LOC Jordan  ] plans to send more troops to [LOC Afghanistan  ] ; [ORG Amb  ] . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] said [PER Judeh  ] had made the same point during his recent visit to [LOC Washington.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Amb  ] . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] said the decisions on the [MISC Afghan  ] reintegration program and the upcoming elections would be the key deliverables for the [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] meeting and would pave the way to success in [LOC London  ] . 
[ORG AbZ  ] asked what the role of reintegration fund contributors would be , noting that the [LOC UAE  ] did not want to be associated with a fund that [MISC Afghans  ] would find ineffective , non-transparent or slow . 
[ORG AbZ  ] said funding must go to programs with clear benchmarks that have strong financial and policy oversight . 
He added that it is “very crucial” [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] donate to the fund , for symbolic reasons . 
Turning to the elections , [ORG AbZ  ] suggested a compromise solution , whereby the [MISC Afghan  ] government would ask [ORG ISAF  ] when it would be ready to support the elections , rather than having any party dictate to President [PER Karzai  ] . 
DISRUPTING [ORG TALIBAN FINANCE  ] -------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Amb  ] . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] stressed to [ORG AbZ  ] the importance of [LOC UAE  ] efforts to combat [ORG Taliban  ] financial flows through the [LOC UAE  ] . 
[ORG Amb  ] . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] noted the productive meeting he and [ORG Treasury A/S Cohen  ] had with [ORG UAE National Security Advisor Sheikh Hazaa  ] bin [PER Zayed  ] earlier on January 12 and the [MISC UAE’s  ] efforts to crack down on bulk cash smuggling . 
[PER A/S Cohen  ] added that the [ORG USG  ] is most concerned about Dubai’s central role in regional financial flows. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG AbZ  ] asked several questions about [ORG USG  ] concerns and the [MISC UAE’s  ] response , including if [ORG Taliban  ] financial flows are regional and/or transiting [LOC Dubai  ] , what is the suspected value of these flows , why the [ORG USG  ] does not intercepting the funds in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , if incoming or outgoing cash declarations would help , and if the [ORG USG  ] believed the [LOC UAE  ] was not effectively enforcing existing regulations . 
[ORG Amb  ] . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] and [PER A/S Cohen  ] explained that the [ORG USG  ] is concerned that [LOC Dubai  ] is being used for the facilitation of the flow of [ORG Taliban  ] funds , goods and personnel to and from [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The [ORG USG  ] is working with [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] , but that the [LOC UAE  ] should also take steps to enforce and investigate inbound cash declarations and amend laws to require outbound declarations . 
[ORG A/S Cohen  ] noted that the planned [MISC DHS/ICE  ] cash courier training in February would focus on identifing and intercepting likely couriers . 
[LOC PAKISTAN  ] - [PER ZARDARI  ] CONCERNS --------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG AbZ  ] said he had met with [MISC Pakistani  ] President [PER Asif Zardari  ] in [LOC Dubai  ] in late December and the latter was “in better shape” than [ORG AbZ  ] expected . 
Stressing the sensitivity of the information , [ORG AbZ  ] told [ORG Amb  ] . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] that [PER Zardari  ] had asked [ORG AbZ  ] to convey a request to [LOC UAE  ] President [PER Sheikh Khalifa  ] ( AbZ’s half-brother ) that Zardari’s family be allowed to live in the [LOC UAE  ] in the event of his death . 
( [ORG Note:  ] The [PER Bhutto  ] family has lived in [LOC Dubai  ] for years and in effect this would be a continuation of a commitment late [LOC UAE  ] President [PER Sheikh Zayed  ] made to [PER Ali Zulfikar Bhutto  ] . 
End Note . 
) [LOC IRAN  ] - AND [LOC YEMEN  ] ---------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Turning to his late December trip to [LOC Iran  ] , [ORG AbZ  ] said it was his first meeting with [PER Ahmedinejad  ] that did not include a cleric ( murshid ) . 
He interpreted this to mean that [PER Ahmedinejad  ] is now trusted and does not need constant supervision . 
Noting that [PER Ahmedinejad  ] had cited [MISC Western  ] media criticism of Dubai’s financial situation as a plot against [LOC Dubai  ] , [ORG AbZ  ] told [ORG Amb  ] . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] he believes [PER Ahmedinejad  ] is “crazy but well-educated.” [ORG AbZ  ] said he felt [LOC Tehran  ] is going backwards although he was surprised by the number of women “not covered up properly.” The [MISC Iranians  ] believe that the [LOC United States  ] is now preoccupied in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] , which will prevent any [LOC US  ] attack on [LOC Iran  ] . 
[ORG AbZ  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] message on [LOC Iran  ] in the region is “not loud and clear.” Many are acting like [LOC Iran  ] is already a nuclear power , and [LOC Iran  ] sees the [LOC United States  ] is not doing anything about it . 
If [LOC Middle East  ] peace was achieved , [ORG AbZ  ] said the [MISC Iranians  ] would be unable to suggest they are the defenders of the [MISC Palestinian  ] cause. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG AbZ  ] said that FM [PER Mottaki  ] was polite and courteous , “for a change” during the December visit . 
He added that [PER Mottaki  ] called him on January 3 to convey that the [LOC U.S.  ] had promised democracy and development in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , but the result was more smuggling , narcotics and terrorist acts . 
[PER Mottaki  ] went on to discuss [LOC Yemen  ] , telling [ORG AbZ  ] that [MISC Saudi  ] and [LOC US  ] forces are attacking civilians in [LOC Yemen.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 .
