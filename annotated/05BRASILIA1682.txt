( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Summary: Rattled  ] by a mounting scandal over alleged [PER Lula  ] administration vote-buying in the [ORG Congress  ] , the [ORG GoB  ] has , among other measures , attempted to shore up support among the economic elite by enacting a decree to remove certain taxes on capital investments by exporters . 
The scandal has toppled [PER Lula  ] 's powerful Chief of Staff ( ref C ) and will likely hasten the planned departure of [ORG Central Bank  ] President [PER Henrique Meirelles  ] , currently under investigation on unrelated tax charges ( ref D ) . 
Financial markets have hardly blinked: the [ORG GoB  ] placed USD 600 million in Eurobonds on June 20 at lower interest rates than it had been able to obtain in a February 2005 offering and the Real has resumed its pre-scandal appreciation against the dollar . 
The [ORG GoB  ] also is trying to shift the public 's focus by proposing a dramatic tightening of fiscal policy , which it hopes would create space for large reductions in [LOC Brazil  ] 's unpopular high interest rates . 
The political scandal , however , makes it extremely unlikely that the [ORG GoB  ] will be able to obtain passage of these fiscal measures , a critical piece of which must be approved by a three-fifths majority of [ORG Congress  ] . 
The [ORG GoB  ] 's broader microeconomic reform agenda ( ref B ) is in similarly difficult straits . 
Without significant reforms , however , expect GDP growth in the election year of 2006 to be only marginally better than the modest growth expected this year ( 2.5% to 3.0% ) . 
End Summary . 
[ORG Central Bank  ] President a [PER Lame Duck  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Along with the downfall of President [PER Lula  ] 's powerful chief of staff [PER Jose Dirceu  ] , the vote-buying scandal ( ref C ) looks likely to hasten the departure of [ORG Central Bank  ] President [PER Henrique Meirelles  ] . 
[PER Meirelles  ] is under investigation by the [ORG Supreme Court  ] on charges , unrelated to the scandal , i.e. , that he evaded taxes , engaged in illegal money transfers and violated electoral laws in his 2002 [ORG Congressional  ] campaign ( ref D ) . 
While [PER Meirelles  ] long had been planning to leave the [ORG Central Bank  ] by end-August to prepare his planned run for governor of [LOC Goias  ] state in 2006 , the vote-buying scandal has made his tenure at the [ORG Central Bank  ] less tenable . 
The leading candidate to replace [PER Meirelles  ] , Vice Finance Minister [PER Murilo Portugal  ] , who was [LOC Brazil  ] 's Executive Director at the [ORG IMF  ] until April , has a sterling reputation as a fiscal and monetary conservative and would likely maintain [ORG Bank  ] policies along the lines set by [PER Meirelles  ] and his team. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Accordingly , financial markets have been taking the political scandal in stride . 
After an initial wobble , the Real has resumed its trend of appreciation against the dollar ( ref A ) , and is close to its three-year high against the dollar . 
On June 20 , the [ORG GoB  ] placed a $600 million ten- year Eurobond at a spread of a mere 363 basis points over [LOC U.S.  ] treasuries . 
By comparison , the yield on this bond offering , 7.73% , was down from the 7.9% yield on [LOC Brazil  ] 's February $1 billion offer , although the spread over [LOC U.S.  ] treasuries on that offer was 10 basis points lower . 
Pork over [LOC Payola  ] ---------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG GoB  ] moved quickly after the scandal broke to try to shore up its support with industry by speeding up the issuance of a [ORG Provisional  ] Measure ( [ORG MP  ] ) , previously under consideration , which creates a grab-bag of goodies for several sectors . 
( Note: MPs are a form of executive decree with immediate force of law , but which nevertheless require congressional ratification to become permanent legislation . 
) [ORG MP  ] 252 , issued by [PER Lula  ] on June 15 , enacts a series of changes in the tax system to benefit multiple sectors . 
The " [MISC Recap  ] " tax regime would suspend certain taxes on the sales and importation of capital goods for firms of which 80 percent or more of revenues are export-related , while the " [MISC Repes  ] " provides specific exemptions for software and IT exporters . 
The [ORG MP  ] also makes more flexible a tax credit regime applicable to capital investments . 
Some [MISC Brazilian  ] analysts have questioned the WTO-consistency of the tax benefits for exporters ; see septel for an unofficial translation of the relevant provisions. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG MP  ] 252 also enacts tax measures to help the construction industry , including an income tax exemption on the capital gains on the sale of a home if the seller buys a new home of equal or greater value within 180 days . 
In conjunction with several related MPs , [ORG MP  ] 252 also seeks to create incentives for innovation by doubling tax deductions on the amount a firm spends for research and development . 
While [ORG Congress  ] has not yet acted on [ORG MP  ] 252 , given the popularity of tax cuts the measure , in some form , is likely to be approved. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Finance Ministry  ] has estimated the cost of [ORG MP  ] 252 , in foregone revenues , at 1.5 billion Reals this year ( approximately $625 million ) and 3.3 billion Reals ( $1.3 billion ) next year . 
Despite the measure 's cost , there is little risk that the [ORG GoB  ] will not meet its primary surplus target . 
Revenues continue to grow faster than GDP and the [ORG GoB  ] retains discretion not to spend amounts authorized in the budget . 
Moreover , [ORG IMF  ] Resident Representative [PER Max Alier  ] and [ORG UN  ] economist [PER Carlos Mussi  ] emphasized to Econoff that , even if it wanted to , the [ORG GoB  ] would find it hard to try to " buy " its way out of the scandal . 
Fiscal Responsibility Law ( LRF ) provisions requiring that new spending be matched with a funding source are not easily bypassed , [PER Alier  ] argued . 
[PER Mussi  ] observed that , to avoid even the hint of impropriety , the knee jerk response of [PER Lula  ] 's orthodox-minded economic team to a political crisis will be to trend even more conservative on spending decisions . 
Others within the [ORG GoB  ] have made much the same point ; i.e. with macroeconomic stabilization and the resumption of economic growth representing the principal achievement to date of the [PER Lula  ] administration , the president is loathe to tinker with his orthodox macroeconomic policies . 
Fiscal Policy to Attack Interest Rates -------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) To reaffirm its credentials with the market -- and attack a principal cause of roundly unpopular high interest rates -- the [ORG GoB  ] is debating a relatively bold series of fiscal measures to tighten fiscal policy . 
Principal among these is moving , over the course of four to five years , from targeting a primary surplus to an overall balanced budget ( nominal deficit of zero ) . 
The idea , which has some traction with fiscally conservative elements in [ORG Congress  ] , is to create space for dramatic interest rate reductions in the medium term by significantly reducing the [ORG GoB  ] 's borrowing requirements . 
This would reduce crowding out of credit to the private sector and allow interest rates to fall . 
( Note: Many other factors also influence [LOC Brazil  ] 's infamously high real interest rates -- see ref E . 
) The plan 's proponents ( among them Federal Deputy and former Finance Minister [PER Delfim Netto  ] ) argue that falling interest rates would have a " virtuous circle " effect , and by reducing [ORG GoB  ] interest costs , further reduce the borrowing requirement. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) For the plan to work , the [ORG GoB  ] would require greater flexibility in prioritizing expenditures and the ability to use a greater proportion of revenues for debt service . 
Currently , the vast majority of [ORG GoB  ] revenues are subject to constitutional earmarks and revenue sharing requirements with state and municipal governments . 
The [ORG GoB  ] would have to obtain [ORG Congressional  ] support for a constitutional amendment enlarging the current de-earmarking measure ( or DRU , in its [MISC Portuguese  ] acronym ) from 10% of overall federal revenues to 20% or 30% of revenues . 
Moreover , not all of the mooted measures have [MISC GoB-wide  ] support . 
While supporting a move towards a nominal fiscal balance , the [ORG Finance Ministry  ] has pointed out that a strict target would require volatile primary expenditure patterns if the [ORG GoB  ] had to act to offset sudden interest rate and exchange rate shifts . 
For similar reasons , in a conversation with Econoff , the [ORG IMF  ] 's [PER Alier  ] also questioned the wisdom of a firm nominal balance target . 
The overall idea of using greater fiscal restraint and expenditure flexibility to create room to reduce interest rates , however , has found a sympathetic audience among politicians and businessmen weary of sky-scraping interest rates . 
Comment ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) A significant part of the [ORG GoB  ] 's response to the political vote-buying scandal has focused on economic policy , which is at best a secondary tool in dealing with the problem . 
Nevertheless , it is to the [ORG GoB  ] 's credit that its proposed reforms to attack ( unpopular ) high interest rates are grounded in orthodox economics . 
Moreover , its pork-barrel [ORG MP  ] will not vitiate its ability to meet its primary surplus targets . 
But , with a poisoned congressional atmosphere , it is difficult to see the [ORG GoB  ] obtaining passage of any significant legislation to tighten fiscal policy , much less getting the three-fifths majority necessary to modify constitutional earmarking requirements . 
In addition , [PER Lula  ] 's microeconomic reform agenda ( ref B ) looks dead , with the exception of measures that do not require congressional action , such as implementation of already-approved public- private partnerships ( PPPs ) . 
Without significant reforms , however , GDP growth next year should not be much better than this year 's expected 2.5% to 3.0% . 
All of this must weigh heavily on the mind of a reelection-minded President , who , absent some unexpectedly deft political management , is in danger of becoming seriously politically weakened with more than a year to go before the 2006 elections .
