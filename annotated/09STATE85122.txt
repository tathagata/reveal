( U ) This is an ACTION REQUEST: Please see para 10 . 
SUMMARY <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Since 2004 , the [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency  ] ( [ORG IAEA  ] ) [ORG Secretariat  ] has promoted the concept of multilateral nuclear fuel assurances . 
This concept is intended to strengthen the international nuclear fuel market and thereby remove an incentive for states to develop indigenous uranium enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing capacity . 
Since the [ORG IAEA  ] produced a set of recommendations on this issue in 2005 , a number of states associated with the [ORG Nonaligned Movement  ] ( [ORG NAM  ] ) and [ORG Group of  ] 77 ( [MISC G-77  ] ) have criticized this concept due to suspicions that it is an attempt to strip them of the right to the fullest possible access to peaceful nuclear technology . 
The past few years have seen an impasse featuring entrenched rhetoric about fuel cycle rights. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) A step forward was taken at the June 2009 meeting of the [ORG IAEA Board of Governors  ] ( [ORG BOG  ] ) , at which the [ORG BOG  ] considered two concrete nuclear fuel bank proposals . 
For the first time , nonaligned states moved beyond rhetoric to raise specific concerns regarding the actual implementation of an international nuclear fuel bank . 
To maintain this positive momentum , [LOC Washington  ] recommends an engagement campaign focused on listening to specific implementation concerns from the most skeptical states . 
BACKGROUND <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) In 2004 , [ORG IAEA  ] Director General [PER ElBaradei  ] tasked an [ORG Expert Group  ] to study the feasibility of " multilateral nuclear approaches " as a means of addressing the potential spread of uranium enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing technologies ( [ORG ENR  ] ) . 
These technologies are considered sensitive since , in addition to producing fuel for civil nuclear reactors , they can also be misused to produce weapons-useable material . 
Released in 2005 as [ORG IAEA  ] document INFCIRC/640 , the [ORG Expert Group  ] 's near-term recommendations called for ( 1 ) reinforcing the existing commercial market of fuel cycle services and ( 2 ) developing and implementing international supply guarantees of fuel cycle services , with the [ORG IAEA  ] as a guarantor . 
( COMMENT: Among others , the [ORG Expert Group  ] included participants from [LOC Argentina  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] , [LOC India  ] , [LOC Malaysia  ] , [LOC South Africa  ] , and the [LOC United States  ] . 
END COMMENT . 
) Upon these recommendations , [ORG IAEA  ] Member [LOC States  ] have developed about a dozen complementary fuel assurance proposals designed to bolster the international fuel market and to remove one incentive for states to develop indigenous [ORG ENR  ] technologies. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) At the June 2009 meeting of the [ORG IAEA  ] [ORG BOG  ] , the [ORG Board  ] considered detailed proposals for the two most advanced concepts: ( 1 ) a low-enriched uranium ( [ORG LEU  ] ) reserve to be located in and financed by [LOC Russia  ] , and ( 2 ) an IAEA-administered [ORG LEU  ] bank to be financed through contributions pledged by the [LOC United States  ] ( nearly $50 million ) , the [ORG European Union  ] ( 25 million [MISC EUR  ] ) , the [LOC United Arab Emirates  ] ( $10 million ) , [LOC Kuwait  ] ( $10 million ) , and [LOC Norway  ] ( $5 million ) , in addition to $50 million in challenge-grant funds from the [LOC U.S.  ] nongovernmental organization [ORG Nuclear Threat Initiative  ] ( [ORG NTI  ] ) . 
Since access to both of these reserves would be controlled by the [ORG IAEA  ] Director General using criteria approved by the [ORG Board of Governors  ] , these are intended to provide impartial , " last resort " supply of [ORG LEU  ] in the event that a consumer state is cut-off by its normal supplier for " non-technical , non-commercial reasons , " and in the event that other international suppliers were unable or unwilling to provide back-up supply. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Since the [ORG IAEA Secretariat  ] launched the current fuel assurances effort , many states associated with the [ORG Nonaligned Movement  ] and [ORG Group of  ] 77 have expressed reservations . 
The primary suspicion is that this is an effort , by major suppliers , to deprive states that do not currently possess [ORG ENR  ] technology of the opportunity to do so . 
Many states ( including most action addresses ) have individually , or through association with [ORG NAM  ] or [MISC G-77  ] statements , voiced concerns about losing their " inalienable right " under the [ORG Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty  ] to the fullest possible access to peaceful nuclear technology . 
The detailed [MISC Russian  ] and [ORG IAEA  ] proposals presented to the [ORG BOG  ] therefore included explicit language stating that access to the fuel banks would not require a state to give up its right to pursue any fuel cycle technologies . 
Rather , the idea is that an assured supply of nuclear fuel would help persuade states that there is no need to exercise their right to invest in costly and complex [ORG ENR  ] programs. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In partial response to this clarification , a step forward was taken at the June 2009 [ORG BOG  ] meeting . 
At this meeting nonaligned states moved beyond rhetorical statements about " rights " to raise specific concerns regarding the actual implementation of a fuel bank ( ref A ) . 
[LOC Washington  ] believes this advance in the content of the debate was also facilitated by the fact that detailed proposals were put before the [ORG BOG  ] , which enabled states to provide constructive comments on actual implementation details . 
For example , statements by [ORG NAM  ] countries raised specific concerns that needed to be addressed , such as reliability of the triggering mechanism , eligibility criteria , financing , liability , and fuel fabrication issues. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In order to capitalize on the forward momentum generated at the June 2009 [ORG BOG  ] , [LOC Washington  ] recommends engaging key skeptics to listen to their views about specific issues in need of resolution as well as ideas on how to do so ( ref B ) . 
A listening campaign would demonstrate to skeptics that their concerns have been seriously considered and would enable us to gather input on the full spectrum of concerns . 
All feedback , from potential suppliers and recipients , would form a useful basis upon which [LOC Russia  ] and the [ORG IAEA  ] could revise their proposals to gain greater acceptance. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) NOTE FOR NEW DELHI: [LOC India  ] will be addressed separately . 
Department is aware of the unique and fundamental concerns [LOC India  ] has with the fuel bank proposals , and we will be developing a tailored demarche for New [LOC Delhi  ] . 
ACTION REQUEST <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Action addressees are requested to convey the following points to appropriate officials in the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] , as well as appropriate technical ministries , as soon as possible . 
Interlocutors should be encouraged to provide substantive comments on implementation details and to instruct representatives in [LOC Vienna  ] to engage in constructive discussion . 
Technical ministries , which we expect to be generally pragmatic , should be especially encouraged to provide feedback . 
BEGIN TALKING POINTS: -- For five years , the [ORG IAEA Secretariat  ] has sought to establish a mechanism to provide reliable access to nuclear fuel . 
The [LOC United States  ] has supported this effort . 
-- In [LOC Prague  ] , President [PER Obama  ] called for a " new framework for civil nuclear cooperation , including an international fuel bank , so that countries can access peaceful power without increasing the risks of proliferation . 
" -- After a long effort , two concrete fuel bank concepts are now taking shape ) a fuel reserve in [LOC Angarsk  ] , [LOC Russia  ] and an IAEA-administered fuel bank . 
-- In June , detailed proposals for these mechanisms were considered by the [ORG Board of Governors  ] , and for the first time Member [PER States  ] were able to comment on explicit issues associated with their implementation . 
-- The [LOC United States  ] was encouraged by the thoughtful discussion that ensued and by the constructive comments made by many Member [LOC States  ] . 
-- We hope this pragmatic dialog will be sustained at the September [ORG Board  ] . 
-- Since your country has a particularly influential voice in this discussion , we believe it would be very helpful to have a clear understanding of your views of these proposals . 
-- For example , what particular implementation issues do you view as most problematic ? 
How would you recommend these be addressed ? 
-- We encourage you to share your detailed views with us , with others on the [ORG Board  ] , and with the [ORG IAEA Secretariat  ] . 
-- It is our hope that the [MISC Russian  ] and [ORG IAEA  ] proposals will be elaborated ( upon ) to reflect the concerns of all [LOC BOG States  ] , so that these can be improved in such a way that is acceptable to all . 
If asked/As needed: -- We believe that a fuel assurance mechanism would help increase access to civil nuclear power in a manner that simultaneously addresses proliferation concerns . 
-- Both of the proposals under consideration by the [ORG Board of Governors  ] make clear that access to these mechanisms would not require giving up any right to peaceful nuclear technologies . 
-- President [PER Obama  ] echoed this sentiment in [LOC Prague  ] , when he stated that " no approach will succeed if it is based on the denial of rights to nations that play by the rules . 
" END TALKING POINTS. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) Department thanks Posts for their assistance in this matter . 
Department points of contact for working-level fuel assurance issues are [PER Marc Humphrey  ] and [PER Burrus Carnahan  ] ( ISN/NESS ) ; please include USMISSION UNVIE [LOC VIENNA  ] as an info addressee on all responses .
