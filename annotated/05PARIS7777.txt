( C ) Summary: The November 11 assault of a [MISC French  ] journalist in [LOC Tunis  ] by unknown assailants widely believed to belong to the [MISC Tunisian  ] security services has prompted an outcry among [MISC French  ] media , which has harshly criticized [MISC GoF  ] complacency on [MISC Tunisia’s  ] human rights situation , with some leading dailies and opposition politicians calling for the [LOC France  ] to boycott the [ORG World Summit  ] for the [ORG Information Society  ] ( [ORG WSIS  ] ) . 
The [MISC GoF  ] response , meanwhile , has been limited to cautious [ORG MFA  ] statements calling for the [MISC Tunisian  ] government to shed light on the attack and respect freedom of information . 
[ORG MFA  ] contacts confirmed that the controversy will not result in a [MISC GoF  ] boycott of the [ORG WSIS  ] , though the [MISC GoF  ] delegation head , currently Finance Minister [PER Breton  ] , may be downgraded to a junior minister level , depending on the degree to which the issue continues to generate domestic controversy . 
[ORG MFA  ] contacts privately expressed pessimism on prospects for improvement in [MISC Tunisia’s  ] human rights situation in the wake of the [ORG WSIS  ] , and were similarly negative on the likelihood of [LOC France  ] taking a tougher stance on [MISC Tunisian  ] human rights , as long as [ORG Chirac  ] remains president . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC French  ] media continues to report widely on the attack on “Liberation” correspondent [PER Christophe Boltanksi  ] , who was beaten and stabbed by four unknown assailants late November 11 in [LOC Tunis  ] , after having extensively reported on human rights abuses on the eve of the [MISC GOT-hosted  ] [ORG WSIS  ] . 
Several [MISC French  ] newspapers , led by “Liberation , ” have suggested that Boltanski’s attack was perpetrated by [MISC Tunisian  ] security services , though the identities of the attackers remain unknown and there is no definitive evidence . 
[PER Boltanski  ] , who did not require hospitalization and returned to [LOC France  ] shortly after the attack , declared in press remarks that his attackers took their time , stole his bag containing interview notes , and were not stopped by the very heavy police presence in the diplomatic quarter where the attack took place . 
[PER Boltanksi  ] dismissed the likelihood that the attack was criminally motivated , noting that foreign journalists in [LOC Tunisia  ] are heavily monitored and that human rights activists in [LOC Tunisia  ] have faced similar attacks from plain-clothes [MISC Tunisian  ] security service officials . 
Follow-up incidents of alleged [ORG GOT  ] harassment of [MISC Belgian  ] and [MISC Swiss  ] journalists and a [MISC French  ] “TV 5” news crew in [LOC Tunis  ] continued to attract heavy [MISC French  ] media coverage November 16. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In a November 13 statement issued some 40 hours after the [PER Boltanski  ] assault took place , the [ORG MFA  ] declared , “We have made it known to the [MISC Tunisian  ] authorities , in [LOC Paris  ] and in [LOC Tunis  ] , that we are counting on them to shed all light possible on the attack...” In a follow-up statement November 15 , FM [ORG Douste-Blazy  ] called on the [ORG GOT  ] to respect freedom of information and not impede the work of journalists attending the [ORG WSIS  ] , without protesting the [PER Boltanski  ] assault. “Liberation” November 14 decried the [MISC GoF’s  ] belated and mild reaction to the [PER Boltanski  ] attack and recurring human rights abuses in [LOC Tunisia  ] , which it ascribed to longtime complacency by President [ORG Chirac  ] towards the human rights situation in [LOC Tunisia  ] , as a means of protecting [MISC French  ] commercial and strategic interests there. “Liberation” and several other [MISC French  ] dailies cited Chirac’s widely reported comments during a December 2003 visit to [LOC Tunisia  ] ( reftel ) , in which he dismissed the concerns of protesting civil society activists in [LOC Tunisia  ] and described the right to food as paramount above political liberties. “Liberation” concluded that the [MISC French  ] president had shown himself to be closer to [LOC Moscow  ] and [LOC Havana  ] on human rights issues , than fellow [MISC Western  ] democracies . 
A November 15 “Le Monde” editorial went further in making unfavorable comparisons between [MISC French  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] policy towards [LOC Tunisia  ] , noting that the [LOC U.S.  ] had not hesitated to call publicly for [LOC Tunisia  ] to pursue political and human rights reforms , while [LOC France  ] “did not have such courage.” The “Le Monde” editorial concluded by calling on [LOC France  ] to abstain from attending the [ORG WSIS  ] , or , at minimum , to pressure [LOC Tunisia  ] via the [ORG EU  ] to comply with its [ORG EU  ] association agreement obligations , which remained a “dead letter.” Leaders of the opposition [ORG French Socialist party  ] ( [ORG PS  ] ) echoed the call for a [ORG WSIS  ] boycott and called on the [MISC GoF  ] to issue an “official protest” of the [PER Boltanski  ] assault. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told usXXXXXXXXXXXX that the [PER Boltanski  ] attack would not affect [MISC GoF  ] participation in the [ORG WSIS  ] , for which Minister of Economy/Finance [PER Thierry Breton  ] would lead the [MISC French  ] delegation . 
In a follow-up discussion [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was more cautious , and noted that the degree of [MISC French  ] media attention on the attack and consequent criticism of [MISC GoF  ] human rights policy was unprecedented . 
While [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] affirmed that a [MISC GoF  ] boycott of the [ORG WSIS  ] was out of the question , he conceded that there was a slim possibility that the delegation head might be downgraded to the junior minister level , depending on the degree to which the issue continued to generate controversy , especially during the weekly audience by FM [ORG Douste-Blazy  ] before the [ORG National Assembly  ] foreign relations committee November 15 . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] commented that the [ORG GoT  ] had viewed the [MISC GoF  ] decision to send [PER Breton  ] to the [ORG WSIS  ] as an “insult , ” given that the [MISC French  ] PM had attended the first [ORG WSIS  ] summit and that [LOC Tunis  ] had lobbied unsuccessfully for Chirac’s attendance. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] remained skeptical on prospects for finding Boltanski’s attackers or for any near-term improvement in [MISC Tunisia’s  ] human rights situation in the aftermath of the [ORG WSIS  ] . 
While noting there was no evidence of [ORG GoT  ] involvement in the [PER Boltanski  ] assault , he mused that the [ORG GoT  ] was effective in covering up such matters . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] speculated that the modest gestures which [LOC Tunisia  ] had made in the run-up to the [ORG WSIS  ] -- allowing access to banned websites , for instance -- would evaporate as soon as the [ORG WSIS  ] had ended , with the [ORG GoT  ] likely to crack down on the hunger strikers as well . 
Pressed for details on how the [MISC GoF  ] was articulating its human rights concerns to the [ORG GOT  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] offered few details . 
He noted that the [MISC French  ] embassy in [LOC Tunis  ] , for the first time , had received a representative of the eight hunger strikers November 14 , though the [MISC GoF  ] had opted not to send any emboffs to meet the hunger strikers themselves , which he said would cross a “red line” for the [MISC GoF  ] and provoke a crisis with the [ORG GoT  ] . 
Explaining the degree to which the [MISC GoF  ] sought to accommodate the [ORG GoT  ] on human rights concerns , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that when [MISC French  ] FM [ORG Douste-Blazy  ] met with representatives of the [MISC Tunisian  ] League of [ORG Human Rights  ] ( [ORG LTDH  ] ) during a visit to [LOC Tunis  ] last October , the [MISC French  ] [ORG MFA  ] received a delegation of pro-GOT [ORG LTDH  ] members , as a quid pro quo requested by the [ORG GOT.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Pressed to explain why the [ORG GoF  ] could not speak more forcefully with [LOC Tunisia  ] on human rights , given the friendship between the two countries , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] commented that “everyone” in the [ORG MFA  ] wanted to see the [MISC GoF  ] take a more activist stance on political repression in [LOC Tunisia  ] , which was entirely without justification , as a political opening posed no risk to the stability of the [ORG GoT  ] . 
On the contrary , continued suppression of basic political liberties by the [ORG GoT  ] , out of step with [MISC Tunisia’s  ] economic success and educated population , could spell trouble for [MISC Tunisia’s  ] long-term stability and open the door to [MISC Islamist  ] influence . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] concluded , though , that , despite media criticism and the preferences of working level [ORG MFA  ] officials , [ORG GoF  ] human rights policy on [LOC Tunisia  ] would remain unchanged as long as [ORG Chirac  ] remained President . 
In [LOC XXXXXXXXXXXX’s  ] view , the [MISC French  ] leader’s ties with [PER Ben Ali  ] were too long-standing for the [MISC French  ] president to adopt a new approach. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Comment: We view this controversy as indicative of the degree to which President Chirac’s “stability first” and tradition of cultivating close relations with aging [MISC Arab  ] world dictators is increasingly out of step with current realities and prevailing media opinion in [LOC France  ] . 
While the media focus on the [PER Boltanski  ] attack may subside in coming days , we expect that the [MISC GoF  ] will remain vulnerable to further domestic criticism for inaction on human rights issues in [LOC Tunisia  ] -- as the [ORG MFA  ] speculated , as long as [ORG Chirac  ] remains president .
