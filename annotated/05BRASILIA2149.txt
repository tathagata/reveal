( C ) Summary: Financial markets have , to date , largely taken in their stride the interlocking set of vote-buying and corruption scandals currently engulfing [LOC Brazil  ] 's political class ( ref A ) . 
Several factors are working together to insulate the economy against the political turbulence , including the credibility of GoB macroeconomic policy , record liquidity flowing to emerging markets , [LOC Brazil  ] 's strong fiscal stance ( 5.1% of GDP primary surplus ) and its continuing current account surplus ( 1.9% of GDP ) . 
We see few indications that the markets' mood is changing . 
Indeed , over the last two years [LOC Brazil  ] has done much to reduce its vulnerability to shocks , both external and domestic . 
Nevertheless , [LOC Brazil  ] 's economy is far from invulnerable to a shift in market sentiment and could suffer should the scandals deepen or the country suffer a sharp external shock . 
This cable looks at several possible political outcomes and the potential consequences for the economy with respect to each . 
In neither of the two most likely scenarios ( [PER Lula  ] remaining until the 2006 elections or his resignation/impeachment and replacement by Vice President [PER Alencar  ] ) would we expect a sharp change in economic policy , reflecting the overall consensus among [MISC Brazilians  ] in favor of orthodox economic policies . 
While it is clear that [MISC Brazilians  ] are fed up with the corruption of their political class , there is little evidence that they are calling for a sharp break with the current institutional framework and its economic policies . 
Under no set of circumstances , however , is the microeconomic reform agenda , necessary to boost potential GDP growth , likely to be retaken until after the October 2006 elections . 
End Summary . 
Scenario One: Weak [PER Lula Remains  ] until 2006 Elections --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Our base case scenario is that [PER Lula  ] will serve out the remainder of his term , albeit in a severely weakened state . 
Former Chief of Staff [PER Dirceu  ] 's decision to deny all in his recent [ORG Congressional  ] testimony placed some distance between [PER Lula  ] and the main body of the scandal for a time , although more recent allegations are moving the spotlight closer to [PER Lula  ] ( septel ) . 
Despite [PER Lula  ] 's weakened state and his diminished reelection prospects , multiple factors should help keep him from breaking sharply with the existing , orthodox economic policy line . 
First , after eight years of sound economic policies under the previous [ORG Cardoso  ] administration and three years of such measures under [PER Lula  ] , the majority of [MISC Brazilians  ] , who still remember the " bad old days " of hyperinflation , support an orthodox policy line . 
Indicative of this is the fact that [PER Lula  ] and his [ORG Workers' Party  ] ( [ORG PT  ] ) had to move to center on economic policy in order to become electable , and will need to remain there if they are to have any hope of reelection . 
Second , [PER Lula  ] 's closest remaining advisor , Finance Minister [PER Palocci  ] , has been the architect of this set of policies and analysts here believe he can be counted on to strongly resist any break with the current line . 
Third , [PER Lula  ] 's principal policy success to date has been the restoration of economic stability . 
Few expect him to risk this achievement ( and perhaps his legacy ) by turning to populist solutions late in the game . 
Indeed , many analysts expect GDP growth to pick up in the second half of 2005 , perhaps giving [PER Lula  ] a political boost as well. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Meanwhile , [PER Lula  ] 's political weakness and the [ORG Congress  ] 's own lack of credibility look likely to prevent passage of major microeconomic reform legislation . 
While this will not endanger economic growth in the short term , over the long-run it will condemn [LOC Brazil  ] to a lower potential growth path until such time as political forces align to allow passage of tax reform , [ORG Central Bank  ] independence , financial sector reform and expenditure reform ( i.e. loosening constitutional earmarks ) . 
As the markets already have written off the microeconomic reform agenda , we would not expect any sharp changes to their assessment at this point of [LOC Brazil  ] risk . 
However , some observers worry that [PER Lula  ] 's political weakness will make it harder for him to fight off unhelpful ( from the fiscal discipline point of view ) congressional initiatives , such as the annual/current effort in the [ORG Senate  ] to increase the monthly minimum wage to [ORG Reals  ] 384 ( about [MISC US$165  ] ) , instead of the [ORG Reals  ] 300 that the GoB proposed . 
Another worrisome example is an amendment inserted into this year 's budget directives law , which provides the broad framework for the drafting of the budget and which is still pending in [ORG Congress  ] , that would restrict the Executive 's discretion to freeze expenditures for pork-barrel projects sponsored by individual legislators ( the so-called " individual amendments " ) . 
The GoB also recently approved a 23% pay raise for the military phased in over two years. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The area of most uncertainty in our base case scenario is what future GoB economic policies will come out of the October 2006 presidential elections . 
Although [PER Lula  ] still remains popular , he is becoming increasingly vulnerable . 
Extended corruption investigations no doubt would lower [PER Lula  ] 's poll numbers even further . 
Any decision by [PER Lula  ] not to run in 2006 , combined with his [ORG PT  ] party 's degraded image , would open political space for some of the more radical elements on the left . 
Indeed , some polls show former [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] governor and erratic populist [PER Anthony Garotinho  ] ( currently ineligible to run because of his own , unrelated scandal problems ) of the [ORG PMDB  ] picking up some of [PER Lula  ] 's left-wing supporters in a [MISC Lula-less  ] race . 
[PER Garotinho  ] , however , would have to win against one of several credible [MISC PSDB  ] candidates , including [LOC Sao Paulo  ] Mayor [PER Jose Serra  ] ( whose poll numbers have been strengthening ) , [LOC Sao Paulo  ] Governor [PER Geraldo Alckmin  ] or [ORG Minas Gerais  ] Governor [PER Aecio Neves  ] ( son of the still popular [PER Tancredo Neves  ] ) . 
Based upon their past records , these latter three would very likely embrace a continuation of the [LOC Cardoso/Lula  ] orthodox policy line . 
Scenario Two - VP [PER Alencar Succession  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The word " impeachment " floats in the air with increasing frequency in [LOC Brasilia  ] . 
While not calling for impeachment , even major news weekly [ORG Veja  ] used the cover of its most recent edition to draw parallels to the period prior to the 1992 impeachment of President [PER Collor  ] on corruption charges . 
Should [PER Lula  ] resign or be impeached , [LOC Brazil  ] has a very clear constitutional mechanism for the transfer of power to the Vice President , [PER Jose Alencar  ] of the [ORG Liberal Party  ] ( [ORG PL  ] ) . 
The strength of [MISC Brazilian  ] democratic institutions and the country 's successful use of these mechanisms in the [PER Collor  ] case suggest the transition to a new president would occur without major difficulties. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Even in these difficult circumstances , there are reasons to believe that Vice President [PER Alencar  ] , although an outspoken and frequent critic of [LOC Brazil  ] 's current high interest rates , would not break sharply from [PER Lula  ] 's orthodox economic policies upon taking office . 
First , as is argued above , a majority of [MISC Brazilians  ] support sound economic policies and demand such from their leadership . 
Given his lack of experience in economic policy , [PER Alencar  ] would presumably turn to wiser heads for counsel -- with the likely candidates being responsible veterans of the [ORG Cardoso  ] economic team or perhaps even former military government [PER FinMin Delfim Netto  ] ( who is currently propounding a plan limiting government spending ) . 
Credit Suisse/First [LOC Boston  ] ( [ORG CSFB  ] ) chief economist [PER Nilson Teixeira  ] put the probability of [PER Alencar  ] pursuing orthodox policies at 70% in a recent conversation with Econoff . 
Other observers , including the [ORG IMF  ] resident representative , have echoed this assessment ( without assigning probabilities ) . 
Second , as was the case after [PER Lula  ] 's election in 2002 , [PER Alencar  ] would receive considerable pressure from the markets to support orthodox policies and would need to act quickly upon assuming the presidency to reassure investors . 
Most of the [MISC Brazilian  ] public and the [ORG Congress  ] , likely would view [PER Alencar  ] as a caretaker until the next elections , limiting even further his scope of action to pursue a heterodox policy mix. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Given the caretaker nature of a putative [PER Alencar  ] presidency , we do not believe he would have the clout necessary to push the microeconomic reform agenda through [ORG Congress  ] . 
This would be no worse than under scenario one above , though , as the markets would have already discounted the chances of major reform before the 2006 elections . 
Given congressional disarray in this scenario , however , we do not expect the [ORG Congress  ] effectively to advance significant policy changes . 
Instead , we look for [ORG Congress  ] to erode fiscal discipline opportunistically where it can in support of individual members' re-election campaign efforts . 
Unfortunately , [PER Alencar  ] would be in an even weaker position than [PER Lula  ] to resist spending pressures originating in [ORG Congress  ] . 
Still , such erosion should not fatally undermine overall fiscal discipline given the healthy growth of tax revenues , the Executive Branch 's discretion to sequester excessive expenditures , and [ORG Fiscal Responsibility Law  ] ( [ORG LRF  ] ) restrictions on the budget process . 
Scenario Three -- [PER Lula Survives  ] , but Opens Floodgates --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) This scenario , which we do not believe is likely to occur , posits that [PER Lula  ] , feeling threatened , decides to open the fiscal floodgates and abandon high interest rates in an attempt to shore up his congressional support base to survive politically or perhaps to stave off an impeachment effort . 
This would require the dismissal of the champions of these policies , Finance Minister [PER Palocci  ] and [ORG Central Bank  ] President [PER Meirelles  ] , an event that markets would greet with sharp downturns . 
( As [PER Meirelles  ] told [PER D/NSA Shirzad  ] in November 2004 , " if you see [PER Palocci  ] and me leaving the GoB -- watch out " . 
) [LOC Brazil  ] currently is less vulnerable to external shocks than it was in the lead-up to the 2002 crisis of confidence sparked by the likelihood of [PER Lula  ] 's election . 
Nevertheless , a protracted loss of faith by the financial markets likely would be characterized by a similar set of events to those that unfolded in 2002: sharp depreciation of the Real , capital flight , GoB difficulty in rolling over domestic debt ( except at increased interest rates ) , spiking inflation , etc . 
Such a financial crisis would doubtless play a big part in the 2006 election campaigns , with parties such as the [MISC PSDB  ] campaigning for a return to orthodox economic policies. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [LOC Brazil  ] has institutional safeguards limiting a president 's ability to open the spending floodgates in scenarios such as this . 
Foremost is the [ORG LRF  ] , which requires that specific revenue sources be identified to fund new spending commitments . 
These requirements can be manipulated to a degree ( e.g. by unrealistically inflating predicted revenue flows in the budget ) , but since this requires congressional complicity , there are limits to what extent the safeguards can be undermined . 
The [ORG LRF  ] also prescribes criminal penalties for those who violate it , a fact that acts as a brake on the economic policy bureaucracy , which naturally tends to resist spending pressures . 
Scenario Four ) [ORG PT  ] Splinters ; A Thousand Flowers Bloom --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Our last scenario , the probability of which is at this time difficult to assess , contemplates a discredited [PER Lula  ] causing the [ORG PT  ] to disintegrate ) with the radical elements of the party joining forces with past [ORG PT  ] refugees and other fringe elements to form a new leftist party . 
Figures like Senator [PER Heloisa Helena  ] ( expelled from the [ORG PT  ] in 2003 for voting contrary to the party line ) and [PER Carlos Lessa  ] ( President of the [ORG National Development Bank  ] until dismissed by [PER Lula  ] in 2004 ) would likely rally to this new political entity . 
Freed from the shackles of [MISC Palocci-imposed  ] economic orthodoxy , this amalgam might well embrace traditional leftist economic stances ) such as imposing a moratorium on foreign debt payments , increased corporate taxes , and combatative relations with the [MISC IFIs  ] . 
Should the disintegration of the [ORG PT  ] generate market upheaval ) with the accompanying adverse affects on exchange , interest , and inflation rates ) public debate on these heterodox " solutions " could well begin in earnest . 
This is not to say that any successor government to the [PER Lula  ] administration would adopt such measures . 
As noted earlier , currently there is an extraordinary degree of societal consensus on orthodox economic policies . 
With the moderate [LOC Campo Majoritaria  ] wing of the [ORG PT  ] reining in the party , s radicals , the left side of the political spectrum in [LOC Brazil  ] embraces more or less the same macro-economic line as the center and the right . 
However , should the [ORG PT  ] splinter and radicals regain their voice , while the consensus would not disappear , it would certainly fray. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Although there is some risk that a [PER Lula  ] downfall could ultimately lead the left to unite around a less pragmatic figure than [PER Lula  ] , there is little reason to suspect that this reamalgamated left would be any more successful come election time than [PER Lula  ] was prior to his move to the political center . 
This could change should the scandal become so deep as to undermine public confidence in the institutions of [MISC Brazilian  ] democracy themselves , leading to an institutional crisis that creates space for some of the untainted politicians on the left . 
So far , however , while it is clear that [MISC Brazilians  ] are fed up with the corruption of their political class , there is little evidence that they are calling for a sharp break with the current institutional framework and its economic policies .
