REF: [ORG LA PAZ  ] 03178 Classified By: ECOPOL Counselor [PER Andrew Erickson  ] for reason 1.4 ( d ) . ------- SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Evo [MISC Morales'  ] election in December 2005 was a political earthquake in [LOC Bolivia  ] , sweeping aside political expectations that have defined [MISC Bolivian  ] politics for generations and at the same time breaking open fissures and offering up new possibilities . 
While President [MISC Morales'  ] popularity has risen and fallen since his election , his popularity has surged since the hydrocarbons nationalization and his successful use of political hardball tactics to overcome an opposition-imposed blockade of the senate . 
For now , the traditional opposition appears to be crumbling under the [ORG GOB  ] 's pressure . 
While it is too early to discern the final shifts of [LOC Bolivia  ] 's political tectonic plates this cable is an effort to explore the new political geography of current and potentially future leaders of the country . 
End Summary. ----------------------------- INDIGENOUS & REGIONAL LEADERS ----------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER RENE  ] JOAQUINO CABRERA: A mason by trade , [LOC Potosi Mayor  ] [PER Rene Joaquino Cabrera  ] is an emerging politician known for competent management , reported honesty , and efforts to govern transparently . 
Despite a low public profile , [PER Joaquino  ] has been involved in politics since 1993 and has twice been elected mayor of [LOC Potosi  ] . 
His political group , the [ORG Social Alliance  ] of the People , has earned a reputation of acting independently and moderately to build consensus within [LOC Bolivia  ] 's [ORG Constituent Assembly  ] ( [ORG CA  ] ) . 
However , [PER Joaquino  ] does not have the name recognition or funding necessary for a national campaign . 
Given the number of potential candidates for the next presidential race , there may not be enough political space for [PER Joaquino  ] to make a convincing bid for national office . 
Despite these challenges to [PER Joaquino  ] 's emergence nationally , his indigenous background and personal biography as a former child laborer in the country 's mines could galvanize popular support. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER OSCAR  ] GERARDO MONTES: A member of the [ORG Movement of the Revolutionary Left  ] ( [ORG MIR  ] ) party , [ORG Tarija  ] Mayor [PER Oscar Montes  ] is an intelligent strategist who understands the realities that the political opposition faces in [LOC Bolivia  ] 's current political climate . 
With a wealth of political experience that includes positions within national and local government , [PER Montes  ] has regional name recognition within [ORG Tarija  ] and enjoys a good reputation . 
Understanding the political chasm that separates the country 's eastern and western regions , [PER Montes  ] has expressed interest in creating a politically viable alternative to the [ORG MAS  ] that includes an alliance among [LOC Bolivia  ] 's southern-most departments ( [LOC Chuquisaca  ] , [LOC Potosi  ] , [LOC Ouro  ] , and [ORG Tarija  ] ) . 
He is politically aligned with [PER Joaquino  ] ( see above ) . 
Poloffs believe a national ticket featuring [PER Joaquino  ] as the presidential candidate and [PER Montes  ] as the candidate for vice-president could empower [LOC Bolivia  ] 's southern departments and garner wide national support. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER PEDRO  ] TICANA: Former minister of indigenous affairs under the [LOC Mesa  ] and [ORG Rodriguez  ] governments , [PER Pedro Ticana  ] is unaffiliated with a particular political party and is an effective political operator with a diverse political background . 
A former adviser to [MISC Movement Towards Socialism  ] ( [ORG MAS  ] ) , [PER Ticana  ] is now closely aligned with [LOC Potosi Mayor  ] [PER Joaquino  ] and eastern [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
Helping [PER Joaquino  ] organize a new political party , [PER Ticana  ] could help establish a political block comprising the country 's southern and eastern departments . 
[PER Ticana  ] 's political experience with three [ORG LA PAZ  ] 00003400 002 OF 005 different governments demonstrates his ability to work beyond party lines to establish effective political connections and build consensus . 
As a [LOC Quechua  ] , [PER Ticana  ] has the ability to take advantage of the political prominence indigenous groups now enjoy . 
Political analysts , however , note [PER Ticana  ] prefers to remain behind the scenes rather than seek a national leadership position . 
At a November 2006 indigenous roundtable with Ambassadors [PER Goldberg  ] and [PER Shapiro  ] , [PER Ticana  ] presented himself as a moderate political thinker who seeks to establish a political environment that values inclusion and dialogue. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER MARIO COSSIO  ] CEJAS: Touting a wide range of experience in academia and politics , [ORG Tarija  ] Prefect [PER Mario Cossio  ] 's potential as a rising opposition leader is aided by his hydrocarbons-rich prefecture . 
Given [ORG Tarija  ] 's hydrocarbons revenues , [PER Cossio  ] is well-equipped to advance the agenda of the media luna ( [PER Pando  ] , [PER Beni  ] , [ORG Tarija  ] , and [LOC Santa Cruz  ] departments ) , especially on regional autonomy . 
A member of [LOC Camino  ] al [LOC Cambio  ] , a civic political group , [PER Cossio  ] enjoys broad public support and is viewed positively by the [MISC Bolivian  ] national media . 
His ability to rise as a national opposition leader may also be aided by his discreet role in the highly publicized divide between the media luna and the [ORG GOB  ] , which could help [PER Cossio  ] attract more wide-ranging political support . 
Physically mestizo , [PER Cossio  ] can tap into the support President [PER Morales  ] now enjoys by [MISC Bolivians  ] who identify with him and his background. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [MISC RUBEN COSTAS:  ] The public face of the media luna and a member of [LOC Autonomia  ] Por [LOC Bolivia  ] , [PER Ruben Costas'  ] position as prefect of the economic powerhouse [PER Santa Cruz  ] department gives him a natural edge in establishing himself as a regional opposition leader . 
[PER Costas'  ] willingness to work with the [LOC United States  ] would make him a solid democratic partner . 
His politically savvy use of the media to advance the interests of the media luna have helped establish [PER Costas  ] as one of the primary political opposition leaders . 
His public confrontations with the [PER Morales  ] administration , the latest bringing a public retraction by [PER Morales  ] of his accusations that [PER Costas  ] was involved in a plot against him , have helped [PER Costas  ] score public victories against the [ORG GOB  ] . 
Given his close relationship with other prefects in eastern [LOC Bolivia  ] and his leadership on regional autonomy , [PER Costas  ] is well-known and respected in the east . 
However , his close association with eastern [LOC Bolivia  ] may limit him to a regional leadership position , as the [LOC Altiplano  ] has historically opposed candidates hailing from the east , especially the [PER Santa Cruz  ] department. ------------- THE DINOSAURS ------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER JOSE LUIS  ] [PER PAREDES  ] MUNOZ: A member of [ORG PODEMOS  ] who values [LOC U.S.  ] assistance in [LOC Bolivia  ] , [ORG La Paz  ] prefect [PER Jose Luis Paredes  ] stands out as a potential national opposition leader . 
In an October 11 meeting with [ORG ECOPOL  ] , [PER Paredes  ] privately expressed his interest in obtaining [LOC U.S.  ] support to run for the presidency ( poloff explained that we do not intervene in [LOC Bolivia  ] 's internal affairs ) . 
As the former mayor of [LOC El Alto  ] , [PER Paredes  ] has a strong base of support in the [LOC Altiplano  ] , despite the efforts of several [MISC MAS-controlled  ] social sector groups to drive him from office . 
With a history of demonstrating an ability to govern , [PER Paredes  ] has responded well to the enormous pressure he is under from his constituency and from the central government . 
With an eye towards his political future , [PER Paredes  ] is attempting to shore up support through a public relations campaign highlighting his accomplishments as prefect . 
However , [PER Paredes  ] remains very vulnerable to allegations of corruption in regard to charges filed against him on October 16 for actions allegedly committed while he was mayor of [LOC El Alto  ] . 
[ORG LA PAZ  ] 00003400 003 OF 005 <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) MANFRED REYES VILLA: A former presidential candidate , [LOC Cochabamba  ] Prefect and [PER Agrupacion Unidad  ] por [LOC Cochabamba  ] ( [ORG AUC  ] ) leader [PER Manfred Reyes Villa  ] has a wealth of political experience and broad name recognition although whispers of corruption haunt him . 
Known for delivering on his promises , [PER Reyes  ] is popular among his constituents , which is particularly challenging given his position in an otherwise MAS-dominated prefecture . 
Despite his political experience , [PER Reyes'  ] political potential may have peaked during his 2002 presidential campaign , when he garnered approximately 22 percent of the national vote . 
Lacking a politically relevant party , [PER Reyes  ] ties to [LOC Bolivia  ] 's old guard politicians will likely keep him from regaining a national position . 
Although [PER Reyes  ] may be unable to assume a national role , he will likely remain an important player regionally. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER SAMUEL  ] DORIA MEDINA: A wealthy prominent businessman and national political figure ( since his third place finish in [LOC Bolivia  ] 's December 2005 national elections ) [PER Samuel Doria Medina  ] is the head of the [ORG National Unity  ] ( [ORG UN  ] ) party and a delegate in the [LOC CA  ] . 
An entrepreneur and former minister under ex-President [PER Jaime Paz Zamora  ] , [PER Medina  ] 's financial resources and position within the [LOC CA  ] enable him to coordinate a national opposition movement . 
Known for having political ambitions , [PER Medina  ] may try to thrust himself into the next presidential race without regard for his realistic chances of winning it . 
[PER Medina  ] 's chances to run for the presidency , however , have been reportedly neutralized by his willingness to broker deals with the [ORG MAS  ] in the [LOC CA  ] and threats by the [ORG GOB  ] to nationalize his businesses . 
While the impact of these reports are unknown , [PER Medina  ] would still have to find support outside his party and overcome the leftist , indigenous trend in [MISC Bolivian  ] politics if he were to attempt a presidential campaign . 
In the meantime , [PER Medina  ] will likely continue to play a key role building consensus in the [LOC CA.  ] ---------- IRRELEVANT ---------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER JORGE  ] " [MISC TUTO  ] " [ORG QUIROGA RAMIREZ:  ] The recognized leader of [ORG PODEMOS  ] , [ORG Jorge  ] " [ORG Tuto  ] " [PER Quiroga  ] is considered the glue that binds his party in the [LOC CA  ] and in [LOC Bolivia  ] 's congress . 
Unfortunately , he seems tone-deaf to [LOC Bolivia  ] 's radically changed political environment , and has been unable to strike a chord with the population . 
As the leader of the largest opposition group in the [LOC CA  ] and a former president , [PER Quiroga  ] remains [LOC Bolivia  ] 's primary opposition leader . 
Like [PER Ortiz  ] , [PER Quiroga  ] 's leadership of [ORG PODEMOS  ] may undermine his ability to win national office . 
Beginning late-November 2006 , [PER Quiroga  ] has started to take a more public stance on divisive issues between his party and the [ORG GOB  ] to build pressure and support for a two-thirds vote in the [LOC CA  ] . 
While effective as a party leader , most political analysts concede [PER Quiroga  ] would not fare well in a future presidential race . 
In a recent meeting with the Ambassador , [PER Quiroga  ] appeared less interested in [MISC Bolivian  ] politics than discussing foreign policy -- that of [LOC Bolivia  ] as well as the [LOC U.S.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER OSCAR  ] ORTIZ: An influential and well-known opposition senator from [LOC Santa Cruz  ] , [PER Oscar Ortiz  ] has made a name for himself by using his political position to publicly criticize the [ORG GOB  ] . 
A member of [ORG PODEMOS  ] , with a background in business , [PER Ortiz  ] understands the intricacies of economics and can use his experience to communicate policies that would resonate with a [MISC Bolivian  ] electorate that is increasingly focused on employment . 
Like [PER Costas  ] , his ties to eastern [LOC Bolivia  ] and his pro-business outlook may diminish his ability to rise through the political ranks , particularly in light of [ORG GOB  ] rhetoric against free market economics . 
[PER Ortiz  ] 's affiliation with the [ORG PODEMOS  ] party may also prevent his [LOC LA PAZ  ] 00003400 004 OF 005 emergence as an opposition leader that can gain broad political appeal. ------------- LEFT FIELDERS ------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG SANTOS RAMIREZ:  ] The president of [LOC Bolivia  ] 's senate , [MISC Movement Towards Socialism  ] ( [ORG MAS  ] ) senator [ORG Santos Ramirez  ] is considered the political confidant of President [PER Morales  ] . 
A lawyer by education and a teacher by training , [PER Ramirez  ] has an extensive history in politics as a member of congress before being elected to the senate in 2006 . 
Born in the [LOC Potosi  ] department , [PER Ramirez  ] is well-known in [LOC Potosi  ] and serves as the head of the [ORG MAS  ] party there . 
With a political career closely aligned to President [PER Morales'  ] legislative agenda , [LOC Ramirez'  ] political future is considered heavily dependent on the political successes of the [ORG GOB  ] . 
Rumored to be a major player in the [LOC MAS'  ] political playbook , [PER Ramirez  ] is in a position to assume a leadership position in the event President [PER Morales  ] stumbles ( reftel A ) . 
[LOC Ramirez'  ] role in railroading controversial legislative measures supported by President [PER Morales  ] confirms the opinions of many political analysts who consider him a radical . 
Emboldened by the newfound wave of popularity President [PER Morales  ] is enjoying , [PER Ramirez  ] may shed his politically adept style for a more radical approach . 
With his strong alliances with the [ORG GOB  ] , [PER Ramirez  ] may ride out the wave of President [PER Morales'  ] strong popularity before revealing his personal aspirations to emerge on [LOC Bolivia  ] 's national stage . 
Sensitive reporting indicates that [PER Ramirez  ] may be very vulnerable on corruption and human smuggling charges. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER FERNANDO HUANACUNI:  ] A relative unknown in [LOC Bolivia  ] 's political sphere , professor , lawyer , and [LOC Aymara  ] writer [PER Fernando Huanacuni  ] has raised the eyebrows of political analysts convinced President [PER Morales'  ] successor will hail from the country 's indigenous community . 
Relatively young in political terms at thirty-nine years old , [PER Huanacuni  ] may present a fresh perspective that would be welcomed by a growing population of young [MISC Bolivians  ] frustrated with a government they view as unresponsive . 
A resident of [LOC El Alto  ] and born in the [LOC La Paz  ] department , [PER Huanacuni  ] 's ability to galvanize support for a national run would directly challenge President [PER Morales'  ] base of support . 
Despite his lack of name recognition , [PER Huanacuni  ] 's television show on social pressures is helping him gain wider recognition if he uses it as a method to raise his political profile . 
Similar to the assessments made for other indigenous politicians , [PER Huanacuni  ] 's indigenous background could help him galvanize greater support. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER JUAN  ] DEL GRANADO: Known as the " the Gardener " for his passionate support for environmentally-friendly public works , [LOC La Paz  ] Mayor [PER Juan del Granado  ] is popular among his constituency for his efforts to reform [LOC La Paz  ] and fight corruption . 
He stands as a likely candidate to emerge nationally from the [LOC MAS'  ] rank-and-file if the opportunity presented itself . 
A former member of the [ORG MIR  ] and the [ORG Movimiento Bolivia Libre  ] ( [ORG MBL  ] ) , [PER Granado  ] is the founder and current leader of the [ORG Movimiento Sin Miedo  ] ( [ORG MSM  ] ) , a political party he started when he ran for mayor that is now allied with the [ORG MAS  ] . 
In addition to the publicity [PER Granado  ] enjoys from his position , his skillful use of radio and television for constituent outreach help him raise his profile among the electorate while highlighting his accomplishments in office . 
Despite his alliances with [ORG MAS  ] , however , [PER Granado  ] political viability remains murky at best . 
Considered a member of the middle class , [PER Granado  ] would likely have to counter negative perceptions of the middle class among the indigenous community and traditionally marginalized groups to court their vote . 
A former minister in the [PER Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada  ] administration , [PER Granado  ] would be an easy target for [LOC LA PAZ  ] 00003400 005 OF 005 this past association and this would present a high hurdle for [PER Granado  ] to clear in a national run for office. ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The December 2005 and July 2006 national elections exposed what turned out to be a hollow center of leadership in [LOC Bolivia  ] 's political traditional political classes . 
It was in this vacuum that [PER Evo Morales  ] took the presidency ; [LOC Bolivia  ] 's traditional leaders are still reacting to the earthquake his victory represented . 
The rough-and-tumble politics favored by [PER Morales  ] have further exposed the many weaknesses of the traditional opposition . 
Most recently , the emergence of divisive issues within the [LOC CA  ] has spurred some political leaders to action , and offered tentative clues to possible alternative opposition leadership . 
While a resurgence of the old opposition is possible , it is unlikely that [LOC Bolivia  ] 's future leader will be one of the political dinosaurs and irrelevant leaders of the past . 
[LOC Bolivia  ] remains an overwhelmingly poor country . 
Given the leftward shift of rhetoric among many voters , a post-Morales environment would likely offer serious electoral advantages to a leader emerging from [PER Evo  ] 's indigenous supporters . 
If [PER Morales  ] were to exit unexpectedly , an indigenous or strong regional leader would be the most likely candidate to fill his position . 
This year , President [PER Morales  ] has had a lucky run , with high hydrocarbons and other commodity revenues leaving him abundant room to maneuver . 
That situation will change dramatically , however , when his economic luck runs out .
