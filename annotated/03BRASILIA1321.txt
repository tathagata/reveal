( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary . 
According to [PER Antonio Simoes  ] , [ORG Economic Advisor to Foreign Minister  ] [PER Amorim  ] , local press inaccurately reported [PER Amorim  ] 's April 23 remarks to the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] concerning the [ORG GoB  ] 's alleged intent to delay [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations . 
[PER Simoes  ] stressed to us that the [ORG GoB  ] wants to continue negotiating with the [LOC United States  ] within the [ORG FTAA  ] ; that it is not seeking an extension of the end of 2004 deadline for negotiations ; but that the [ORG GoB  ] can be expected to raise the possibility of limited four plus one negotiations as a politically important supplement to the [ORG FTAA  ] , during USTR [PER Zoellick  ] 's trip to [LOC Brasilia  ] May 27-28 . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In an April 23 telcon , [PER Antonio Simoes  ] , [ORG Economic Advisor to Foreign Minister  ] [PER Amorim  ] , alerted EconOff that [PER Amorim  ] had made remarks earlier that day to the [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] which would have implications for the impending visit by USTR [PER Zoellick  ] . 
The next day , four major dailies ran articles reporting on [PER Amorim  ] 's remarks . 
While each was slightly different in detail , the central message conveyed was that [LOC Brazil  ] wanted to slow down the [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations and seek an extension of the January 2005 deadline for completion . 
Headlines included " [LOC Brazil  ] Going to Delay the [ORG FTAA  ] " and the " Chancellor Disagrees with the [LOC U.S.  ] on the [ORG FTAA  ] . 
" In response to questions about public remarks here on April 22 by Treasury Secretary [PER Snow  ] concerning the [LOC U.S.  ] position vis--vis negotiation of agricultural domestic support disciplines within the [ORG FTAA  ] , [PER Amorim  ] 's response generated a headline " [PER Amorim  ] Warns Against the [PER Siren  ] , s [ORG Song of  ] The [ORG FTAA  ] . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Simoes  ] assured EconOff early April 24 that the press reports were incomplete and inaccurate . 
[PER Simoes  ] insisted that the [ORG GoB  ] is not seeking to delay the [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations and/or to extend the deadline . 
He explained that [PER Amorim  ] had simply said that immediately after taking office , President [PER Lula  ] had slowed down the negotiating pace in order for his new government to have time to conduct an evaluation of the negotiations -- not that this is the plan for the future . 
Furthermore , [PER Amorim  ] 's remarks concerning the negotiation calendar , according to [PER Simoes  ] , referred solely to the timeframe for submission of offers , which the [ORG GoB  ] felt had been too tight and needed to be extended ; [PER Amorim  ] was not referring to the end date for negotiations. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) According to [PER Simoes  ] , [PER Amorim  ] did not want to criticize Secretary [PER Snow  ] , but had to respond to questions raised by Deputies based on press reports that the Secretary had not only reiterated the [ORG USG  ] position that " everything is on the table " but had in addition specifically asserted that the [LOC United States  ] is willing to discuss reductions in domestic farm support within the [ORG FTAA  ] . 
[PER Simoes  ] said that [PER Amorim  ] knew the press reports were an inaccurate reflection of the [LOC U.S.  ] position and needed to convey that to the Deputies . 
This led to the Minister 's warning not to be lured by the sirens' song of " everything is on the table " and to his criticism that Secretary [PER Snow  ] 's declaration had " little substance " and " low credibility . 
" The Minister reportedly reassured Deputies that what matters is how the revised [LOC U.S.  ] offer in July treats products of interest to [LOC Brazil.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Simoes  ] wanted to draw our attention to [PER Amorim  ] 's remarks that the [ORG GoB  ] is studying the possibility of negotiating a more limited [MISC U.S.-Mercosul  ] ( or four-plus-one ) trade agreement and that we should expect [PER Amorim  ] to raise this with USTR [PER Zoellick  ] during their discussions in late May . 
Although qualifying that this is but one possibility that the [ORG GoB  ] is exploring , [PER Simoes  ] opined that [PER Zoellick  ] should be in a position to respond to such an idea during the May talks . 
He stressed that the [ORG GoB  ] would not envision this negotiation supplanting the [ORG FTAA  ] , but rather as supplementing it . 
[ORG GoB  ] thinking , according to [PER Simoes  ] , is that success in negotiating a more limited agreement with the [LOC United States  ] would divert domestic attention from the [ORG FTAA  ] , reduce the negative pressure associated with the [ORG FTAA  ] , and provide the [ORG GoB  ] with political space it needs to move forward on those negotiations . 
( COMMENT: The [PER Lula  ] team has been kicking the idea of a [MISC U.S.-Mercosul  ] agreement around since as early as last October , but has yet to act formally on it or provide details . 
EconOff noted to [PER Simoes  ] that it may be difficult to obtain a substantive response lacking a more definitive description of what is envisioned . 
END COMMENT . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) To provide context , [PER Simoes  ] described the [ORG GoB  ] 's difficult political situation regarding the [ORG FTAA  ] . 
First , groups that have promoted the negative perception surrounding the [ORG FTAA  ] are , in the current administration , in positions to wield more political clout . 
[PER Simoes  ] declined to identify individuals , but [PER Samuel Pinheiro Guimaraes  ] , the Secretary General within [ORG Itamaraty  ] , is certainly in this camp . 
Second , those trying to promote the [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations within and outside the administration find little that they can definitively point to as a " win " for [LOC Brazil  ] to counter [ORG FTAA  ] opponents'claims that the [ORG FTAA  ] is designed to benefit only the [LOC United States  ] . 
The well-known analysis goes like this: the current framework for negotiations includes the areas of interest to the [LOC United States  ] -- services , investment , government procurement , intellectual property rights , to name some -- but , [LOC Brazil  ] has been unable to include the issues of interest to it , namely disciplines on agricultural domestic support , and trade remedies. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Making things still worse , according to [PER Simoes  ] , the [LOC United States  ] presented initial market access offers for goods which not only provide Mercosul with the worst tariff liberalization schedule , but , within that schedule , have their main products of interest in Basket D , the group with an as yet undefined timeline for tariff elimination . 
The United [MISC States'  ] differentiated offers have contributed to a hardening of anti-FTAA sentiment among those opposing [LOC Brazil  ] 's participation in the negotiations. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Simoes  ] also noted that local press omitted to report on the severe criticism that [PER Amorim  ] received from a group of radical [ORG PT Deputies  ] , led by [PER Luciana Genro  ] ( [LOC Rio Grande  ] do Sul ) , who attacked the government for continuing to negotiate the [ORG FTAA  ] when 10 million [MISC Brazilians  ] had already voted against it in a plebiscite last fall . 
This same group of [ORG PT  ] ideologues claimed to be forming a " parliamentary front " to push for a nation-wide referendum on continuing with [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations . 
As relayed by [PER Simoes  ] , [PER Amorim  ] stood up to these deputies , unequivocally arguing that it is in [LOC Brazil  ] , s interests to negotiate the [ORG FTAA  ] and that the government would continue that course. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Concerns similar to Simoes' regarding the political landscape for [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations , were expressed by [LOC Brazil  ] 's new lead [ORG FTAA  ] negotiator , Ambassador [PER Carlos Simas Magalhaes  ] , during a meeting with visiting Congressman [MISC English  ] and his delegation later the same day . 
At the outset of that meeting , [PER Simas  ] catalogued the usual litany of technical problems facing [LOC Brazil  ] -- a new administration with a new team that has had the huge task of reevaluating in technical terms each area of the negotiations ; the particular difficulties posed by investment and government procurement , since [LOC Brazil  ] , s specialists have never negotiated market access in these areas previously ; and so on. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) By the end of the meeting , however , [PER Simas  ] suggested that technical difficulties can be overcome and that in the current [MISC Brazilian  ] environment the main obstacles to the [ORG FTAA  ] are mainly political . 
He reminded the Congressman that the [PER Lula  ] government is leftist and has different sensitivities than the previous administration . 
Echoing Simoes' concern over the negative political impact of what has been widely seen as inadequate [LOC U.S.  ] offers , [PER Simas  ] wondered aloud why the [LOC United States  ] could not have allowed other countries benefiting from preference programs or bilateral trade agreements to merely continue with those preferences during the [ORG FTAA  ] transition period , while putting forward a single [ORG FTAA  ] offer and saving Mercosul , and especially [LOC Brazil  ] , from these political difficulties . 
[PER Simas  ] , like [PER Simoes  ] , said the [ORG GoB  ] is considering proposing a four-plus-one agreement with the [LOC United States  ] , but that it would probably be limited in scope and leave aside the more contentious issues . 
COMMENT ----------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) For some who have followed [LOC Brazil  ] 's attitude toward the [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations over the years , the current host of [ORG GoB  ] complaints and concerns seem familiar and could be dismissed as [ORG GoB  ] positioning rather than a signal of a critical impasse . 
However , the context in which the [ORG GoB  ] , and in particular [ORG Itamaraty  ] , are now formulating policy is dramatically different from the past . 
While [PER Lula  ] has gained support for continuation within the [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations from some groups traditionally opposed , such as the large labor union CUT , new elements of staunch opposition to the [ORG FTAA  ] have now taken up residence within the [ORG GoB  ] , rather than remaining principally in vocal opposition parties and [ORG NGOs  ] . 
This is particularly evident in [ORG Itamaraty  ] , whose internal struggles over [ORG FTAA  ] policy have been the subject of several speculative press reports recently . 
Post understands that for now , Ambassador Hugueney , a proponent of the [ORG FTAA  ] , retains overall responsibility for the [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations , despite articles reporting otherwise . 
However , there is no guarantee he will remain for the long-term . 
Septel will expand on Mission 's take concerning [ORG FTAA  ] status within [ORG GoB  ] and options [LOC Washington  ] may wish to consider in that light and in the run up to [PER USTR Zoellick  ] 's visit .
