ISLAMABAD  ] 5266 ISLAMABAD 4817 B. ISLAMABAD 4369 Classified By: [PER Anne W. Patterson  ] , Reasons 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) This is an action request , see [ORG Para  ] 12 . 
This is a retransmission correcting text in Paragraph 10 of Ref [PER A. Please  ] refer only to this version of the cable. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) SUMMARY . 
Since 2002 , the [ORG USG  ] has reimbursed [LOC Pakistan  ] over 5.3 billion USD for support to [LOC U.S.  ] operations using [ORG Coalition Support Funds  ] ( [ORG CSF  ] ) . 
When pending claims are processed , that figure will likely exceed 5.6 billion USD . 
The [ORG CSF  ] authorizing legislation was written soon after 9/11 ; six years down the road , we need [LOC Pakistan  ] to more vigorously engage in the war on terror , but [ORG CSF  ] is not working the way it should . 
[ORG CSF  ] is not reaching those parts of the [ORG GoP  ] that are shouldering the load in GWOT operations . 
Two clear examples of the problem are helicopter readiness and medical support to the [ORG Frontier Corps  ] . 
The readiness of [MISC Pakistan’s  ] helicopter fleet is poor . 
Despite giving the [ORG GoP  ] 55 USD million for helicopter operations over seven months , only 2 to 6 [MISC Pakistani  ] Cobras are fully mission capable at a time they desperately need air power to fight spreading militancy . 
Additionally , we have processed or will process reimbursement requests for 100 million USD over the year to support medical operations , but the [ORG Frontier Corps  ] still does not receive basic medevac support . 
Another consequence of the current system is political . 
It fuels the internal argument that the [ORG USG  ] is “paying” [LOC Pakistan  ] to fight a [LOC U.S.  ] war - this at a time when the [MISC Pakistanis  ] need to accept the direct threat to their own security and sovereignty posed by al-Qaida , [PER Taliban  ] and extremist forces. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Post has worked extensively with the [ORG GoP  ] to increase [ORG GoP  ] transparency and accountability . 
What we have discovered is that we are receiving reimbursement requests for barbed wire and air defense radar systems that have no or marginal impact on the GWOT . 
We recognize the legal and political sensitivities involved in developing a new approach , but the program , as it is currently being implemented , simply is not meeting [LOC U.S.  ] or [LOC Pakistan  ] counter-terrorism objectives . 
This message outlines several ways forward . 
In the meantime , [ORG DOD  ] or [ORG CENTCOM  ] should undertake an audit or program review of [ORG CSF  ] . 
END SUMMARY . 
TARGETING [ORG CSF  ] FUNDING TOWARD [LOC PAKISTAN  ] AND [LOC U.S.  ] STRATEGIC GOALS <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG U.S. Public Law  ] 109-289 ( 2206 ) authorizes [ORG CSF  ] to reimburse [LOC Pakistan  ] for logistical , military and other support provided to [LOC U.S.  ] military operations . 
Under this authorization , the [LOC U.S.  ] has reimbursed [LOC Pakistan  ] 5.3 billion USD since 2002 . 
When pending claims are processed , the total [ORG CSF  ] reimbursement to [LOC Pakistan  ] will exceed 5.6 billion USD . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] receives nearly 90 percent of total [ORG CSF  ] worldwide . 
While the December 8 , 2003 guidance provided by the Office of the Secretary of Defense ( [ORG OSD  ] ) on parameters for reimbursements is broad , there have been multiple instances in which Post is confident funds have been diverted and that reimbursed claims figures have been seriously inflated . 
A few examples: -- HELICOPTER READINESS . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] received 55 million USD for helicopter operations from July 2006 to February 2007 ; however , Post estimates that as few as 3 [ORG Cobra Helicopters  ] were fully mission capable as recently as 10 weeks ago . 
Post is confident [ORG Army Aviation Command  ] never received the 55 million . 
-- MEDEVAC ASSISTANCE TO FRONTIER CORPS . 
The [ORG Pakistan Army  ] claimed 99 million USD over past 12 months for medical operations and the [LOC U.S.  ] has paid or is in process of paying all/all submitted medical claims . 
Yet , despite providing this plus fully funding 235 million USD [ORG CSF  ] lease assistance for 26 new [PER Bell  ] 412 helicopters , the [ORG Inspector General of the Frontier Corps  ] has repeatedly requested [LOC U.S.  ] assistance in providing assets for medevac , obviously unaware of the resources the [LOC U.S.  ] has provided. --RADAR MAINTENANCE: Between August 2006 and July 2007 , [LOC Pakistan  ] submitted claims for almost 70 million USD in [ORG ADA Radar Maintenance  ] , although there is no enemy air threat ISLAMABAD 00005288 002 OF 002 related to the war on terror. --BARBED WIRE: Between August 2006 and July 2007 , we received a claim for 26 million USD in barbed wire and pickets . 
While these items are no doubt helpful in protecting outposts , the claim figures are highly suspect. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Ambassador , the Office of Defense Representative and [ORG DOD  ] officials have repeatedly raised [ORG CSF  ] disbursement and other problems with the Prime Minister , [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] and key military officials but have not received satisfactory responses . 
In fact , recent correspondence from [LOC Pakistan  ] leadership argues for additional funding to support increased operations. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG CSF  ] reimbursement funds go directly into [LOC Pakistan  ] , s general treasury -- from there we have no visibility on their final destination or application . 
And we are not alone - based on our conversations with [ORG GoP  ] officials , from President [PER Musharraf  ] down to the average [MISC Pakistani  ] private , no one in [LOC Pakistan  ] seems to have a clear grasp of the amount of [LOC US  ] military reimbursement assistance actually provided. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [ORG CSF  ] authorization legislation was drafted soon after 9/11 . 
Six years down the road , we still need [LOC Pakistan  ] to engage more vigorously in the fight against extremism , but it is clear we also need to do a better job of making sure our monies are targeted to meet our counter-terrorism objectives . 
POTENTIAL APPROACHES TO CSF REFORM <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Potential options to address [ORG CSF  ] issues include the following: ( 1 ) [PER Stop  ] approving [MISC Pakistan’s  ] [ORG CSF  ] reimbursement requests until we receive adequate assurances on disbursement ; ( 2 ) Earmark [ORG CSF  ] monies for specific areas: maintenance , support , etc. ; ( 3 ) Create a [ORG CSF  ] “trust fund” that would allow the [ORG USG  ] to control reimbursement and to obligate some funds for specific needs ; or ( 4 ) Convert [ORG CSF  ] into a direct cash transfer program. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Option 1 would lead to a major political clash and damage our military to military relationship , just as we have the potential for greater cooperation under Chief of [ORG Army Staff General Kayani’s  ] leadership . 
This would undermine the very purpose of [MISC CSF--to  ] encourage the [ORG GoP  ] to continue fighting militant extremism . 
The [PER Taliban  ] , al [MISC Qaida  ] and [MISC Islamic  ] extremists represent a clear and growing danger to [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Pakistani  ] security and to regional stability . 
As allies with forces in the region , we have a responsibility to strengthen and focus our assistance to improve their security forces’ capabilities. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) We understand [ORG DOD  ] has determined Options 2 , 3 and 4 would require asking [ORG Congress  ] to amend the authorizing legislation . 
Post could attempt to persuade [LOC Pakistan  ] to concur with establishment of some form of “trust” mechanism - pointing out the alternative may be a severe reduction or loss of funding if [ORG Congress  ] continues to see insufficient transparency and accountability . 
In any event , a new approach is urgently required . 
We believe some variation of Options 2 and 3 , which allow the [ORG USG  ] to earmark at least some [ORG CSF  ] monies for those [MISC Pakistani  ] military elements of vital interest to us ( helicopters , special forces and [ORG Frontier Corps  ] ) , is the most logical and efficient approach . 
[ORG CSF AUDIT/PROGRAM REVIEW  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Post repeats that we do not have visibility over the destination of [ORG CSF  ] funds . 
Accordingly , Post would welcome an audit or program review of the [ORG CSF  ] process by [ORG CENTCOM  ] or by [ORG DOD  ] . 
ACTION REQUEST <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Action Request: Post would appreciate a front-channel response to the options proposed in para 8 and the proposal for an audit/review .
