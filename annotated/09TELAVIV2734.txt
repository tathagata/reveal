( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: During a December 14 meeting with [ORG Senate  ] staff members ( [PER Michael Kuiken  ] , [ORG Senate Armed Services Committee  ] , and [PER Perry Cammack  ] , [ORG Senate Committee  ] on Foreign Relations ) , the Prime Minister 's Director for Policy Planning [PER Ron Dermer  ] confirmed a solid [MISC U.S.-Israeli  ] relationship that weathered a " rocky start " following the transition to new administrations in both countries . 
He argued that the international environment has changed in favor of pursuing a pressure track with [LOC Iran  ] ; tougher sanctions combined with continued domestic pressure within [LOC Iran  ] might bring about change in [LOC Tehran  ] . 
He expressed frustration with the peace process , noting that the [ORG GOI  ] has taken steps in the effort to convince [PER Abu Mazen  ] to return to the negotiating table to no avail . 
[PER Dermer  ] said PM [PER Netanyahu  ] 's patience has " run out , " and that the [ORG GOI  ] will make no more concessions in that regard -- it is time for [PER Abu Mazen  ] to " be a leader . 
" End summary . 
[MISC U.S.-Israeli  ] Relations ---------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Dermer  ] described [MISC U.S.-Israeli  ] relations as good and improving , but acknowledged that the relationship between the new [PER Obama  ] and [PER Netanyahu  ] administrations got off to a " rough , rocky start . 
" He noted that changes in administrations in both countries at nearly the same time were " relatively rare " -- both entered office and started formulating policy based on electoral mandates representing change from the previous administrations . 
[PER Dermer  ] said that the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Israel  ] agree on so many things ; when an issue of disagreement arises , the media tends to disproportionally accentuate the disagreement -- as was the case earlier in the year on settlements. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Since this disagreement , [PER Dermer  ] said relations between the two administrations have improved daily , and were " only getting stronger . 
" He noted greater [MISC U.S.-Israeli  ] cooperation and coordination , especially with regard to confronting [LOC Iran  ] and its attempts to acquire nuclear weapons . 
[PER Dermer  ] said that President [PER Obama  ] does not get enough credit in [LOC Israel  ] for weighing in helpfully on several issues affecting [LOC Israel  ] 's security , such as the [ORG Goldstone Report  ] , problems in the [MISC Turkey-Israel  ] relations , and the recent [ORG EU Council  ] statement on [LOC East Jerusalem  ] . 
He also cited the successful [MISC Juniper Cobra  ] joint missile defense exercise hosted by [LOC Israel  ] in November 2009 . 
[LOC Iran  ] ---- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Dermer  ] said there was " great understanding " between President [PER Obama  ] and PM [PER Netanyahu  ] on [LOC Iran  ] during their first meeting in May 2009 . 
Since then , several events related to [LOC Iran  ] have helped changed the international community 's view on Iran: the [MISC Iranian  ] elections and the regime 's subsequent crackdown , the discovery of the [LOC Qom  ] enrichment facility , and [LOC Iran  ] 's refusal of the [ORG Tehran Research Reactor  ] ( [ORG TRR  ] ) proposal . 
[PER Dermer  ] noted that PM [PER Netanyahu  ] has been quite vocal on [LOC Iran  ] over the last 15 years ; as the PM 's communications advisor , [PER Dermer  ] said he is often asked why [PER Netanyahu  ] has not spoken out against [LOC Tehran  ] recently . 
[PER Dermer  ] described the PM 's uncharacteristic public reticence as a strategic decision to give the [LOC United States  ] a chance to succeed and not undermine the engagement process. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Dermer  ] suggested that the " stars are aligning " in favor of putting more pressure on [LOC Iran  ] . 
He described the upcoming [MISC French  ] [ORG UNSC  ] presidency as positive , while the [ORG GOI  ] was pleased to see the [MISC Swedish  ] [ORG EU  ] presidency come to an end . 
[PER Dermer  ] said the trick was to convince [LOC Tehran  ] that the continued pursuit of its weapons program would cause the regime 's downfall , and that [LOC Russia  ] remains the key on sanctions. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Dermer  ] acknowledged disparate voices within the [ORG GOI  ] on strategy regarding [LOC Iran  ] , but added that PM [PER Netanyahu  ] favored tough economic sanctions combined with support for internal democratic dissent . 
[PER Dermer  ] compared [LOC Iran  ] to the former [LOC Soviet Union  ] , in which experts were shocked by its internal fragility and subsequent sudden collapse . 
The assumption is that [LOC Iran  ] is powerful , he said , but internal dissent coupled with constant external pressure could lead to the fall of the regime . 
He noted the importance of finding [LOC Iran  ] 's " [MISC Achilles  ] heel " to apply pressure on the regime -- perhaps through [LOC Iran  ] 's lack of oil refinery infrastructure . 
[PER Dermer  ] also said that PM [PER Netanyahu  ] was impressed with the recent efforts by [PER Senators Brownback  ] and [ORG Specter  ] to secure funding to provide all-source , uncensored internet access to peoples living [ORG TEL AVIV  ] 00002734 002 OF 002 under repressive regimes . 
Peace Process ------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Dermer  ] noted that the [ORG GOI  ] has taken a number of steps in the effort to jump-start the peace process with the [MISC Palestinians  ] , but to no avail -- as a result , [PER Netanyahu  ] 's patience has " run out , " he said . 
[PER Dermer  ] noted progress on [LOC West Bank  ] checkpoints and outpost evacuations , [PER Netanyahu  ] 's acceptance of the two-state solution during his June 2009 Bar Ilan speech , allowing " violent " individuals into the [LOC West Bank  ] to attend the [ORG Fatah  ] party congress , and the recent settlement moratorium . 
He claimed that 70 percent of the [MISC Israeli  ] public opposes the moratorium ( note: we think this is an exaggeration ) -- this was a difficult decision for [PER Netanyahu  ] , but one he decided to make to restart negotiations. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Dermer  ] lamented the lack of a partner on the [MISC Palestinian  ] side to pursue negotiations . 
He pointed to an interview [PER Abu Mazen  ] gave to The [ORG Washington Post  ] 's [PER Jackson Diehl  ] six months ago in which [PER Abu Mazen  ] implied he would " sit back and wait " for the [LOC United States  ] to deliver [LOC Israel  ] to the negotiating table . 
[PER Dermer  ] accused [PER Abu Mazen  ] of trying to internationalize the conflict , which he described as a " big mistake . 
" The [ORG GOI  ] understands [PER Abu Mazen  ] 's political constraints and lack of support from [MISC Arab  ] regional partners -- but at the end of the day , [PER Abu Mazen  ] must " be a leader , " [PER Dermer  ] said. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Dermer  ] noted that there will come a point readily apparent to the [ORG GOI  ] in which the settlement freeze offers diminishing returns . 
He said the steps or " concessions " the [ORG GOI  ] has taken thus far have been devalued because they were made outside the context of negotiations -- " give us context , " he said . 
In that regard , [PER Dermer  ] stated categorically that the [ORG GOI  ] will not make any more concessions to [PER Abu Mazen  ] in order to return to negotiations -- " that is over . 
" He asked what steps the [LOC PA  ] has taken to return to the negotiating table , and dismissed [MISC Palestinian  ] progress in the security sector as simply efforts to preserve [ORG Fatah  ] 's power. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Dermer  ] said that while [PER Netanyahu  ] is ready to engage at any time , the [MISC Israeli  ] public is skeptical regarding the benefits of returning to negotiations with the [MISC Palestinians  ] . 
He noted that it would be " extremely difficult " for [PER Netanyahu  ] to approach the Cabinet at this point regarding negotiations when all the [ORG GOI  ] has received in return for its efforts was a " slap-down from the international community " following the [ORG Goldstone Report.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Dermer  ] said [PER Netanyahu  ] does not believe [PER Abu Mazen  ] is as weak as he claims , and that [PER Abu Mazen  ] has the potential to " rise to the occasion " in negotiating peace . 
However , he said [PER Abu Mazen  ] must make some sort of gesture to return to the table and " prepare his people " for the difficult decisions necessary for peace . 
Seemingly simple steps such as employing new language or condemning violence and terrorism -- something the [ORG GOI  ] believes [PER Abu Mazen  ] has not done since 2003 -- would be very appreciated , [PER Dermer  ] said. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 .
