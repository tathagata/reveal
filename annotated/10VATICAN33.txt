( C ) Summary: The November 2009 report of cover-up by local bishops of revelations of physical and sexual abuse of children by [MISC Irish  ] clergy appalled [MISC Catholics  ] and others worldwide . 
[LOC Vatican  ] and [MISC Irish  ] officials’ first concern was for the victims , but that reality was sometimes obscured in the events that followed which also cast a chill on [MISC Irish-Vatican  ] relations . 
The [LOC Vatican  ] believes the [MISC Irish  ] government failed to respect and protect [LOC Vatican  ] sovereignty during the investigations . 
Much of the [MISC Irish  ] public views the [LOC Vatican  ] protests as pettily procedural and failing to confront the real issue of horrific abuse and cover-up by [MISC Church  ] officials . 
The resulting profound crisis in the [MISC Irish  ] Church , meanwhile , required intervention by [PER Pope Benedict  ] , who met with [MISC Irish  ] Church leaders in December 2009 and in February 2010 to discuss next steps . 
Although the [PER Pope  ] will address a pastoral letter on the situation to [MISC Irish  ] [MISC Catholics  ] in the next few weeks , both the [LOC Vatican  ] and the local [MISC Catholic Church  ] agree that further follow-up should be handled domestically in [LOC Ireland  ] . 
The Vatican’s relatively swift response to this crisis showed it learned key lessons from the [LOC U.S.  ] sex abuse scandals in 2002 but still left some [MISC Catholics  ] - in [LOC Ireland  ] and beyond -- feeling disaffected . 
The crisis will play out for years inside [LOC Ireland  ] , where future revelations are expected , even as new clerical sex abuse allegations are being made in [LOC Germany  ] . 
End Summary . 
Origin of a [PER Scandal: Horrific  ] and [LOC Endemic  ] ------------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) The [MISC Irish  ] scandal broke in the 1990s , following a series of criminal cases and [MISC Irish  ] government enquiries that established that hundreds of lay persons and priests had abused thousands of children in [LOC Ireland  ] for decades . 
In 1999 , [MISC Irish  ] Prime Minister [PER Bertie Ahern  ] announced a program to respond to the abuse , including a compensation scheme into which the government and various religious orders made contributions . 
In announcing this program , [PER Ahern  ] was the first [MISC Irish  ] official to apologize to the victims . 
He also launched a study into abuse at [MISC Irish  ] institutions run by religious orders but overseen and funded by [ORG Ireland’s Department of Education  ] . 
After nine years of investigation , the [ORG Ryan Commission  ] issued a report in May 2009 that detailed horrific abuses , including 325 alleged cases of abuse by priests , and concluded they were “endemic.” With the crisis unfolding , [MISC Irish  ] [MISC Catholics  ] and [MISC Irish  ] investigators turned to [LOC Rome  ] for additional answers . 
Political Reaction: Inquiries Offend [LOC Vatican  ] and [MISC Irish  ] Public --------------------------------------------- ---------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) After release of the [ORG Ryan  ] report , the [MISC Irish  ] Government ordered an investigation of the [ORG Ryan Commission’s  ] allegations against priests in the [ORG Archdiocese of Dublin  ] , to be conducted by the independent [ORG Murphy Commission  ] . 
Sidestepping diplomatic channels , the [ORG Murphy Commission  ] sent a letter requesting further information to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the [ORG Faith  ] ( [ORG CDF  ] ) , which follows issues relating to clerical misconduct and crimes . 
The [ORG Commission  ] also asked the [LOC Vatican  ] [ORG Nuncio  ] in [LOC Ireland  ] to answer questions . 
( Judge [ORG Murphy  ] argued that the body did not have to follow normal inter-state procedures in making its requests because the independent commission was not part of the [MISC Irish  ] government . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) While [LOC Vatican  ] contacts immediately expressed deep sympathy for the victims and insisted that the first priority was preventing a recurrence , they also were angered by how the situation played out politically . 
The [ORG Murphy Commission’s  ] requests offended many in the [LOC Vatican  ] , the [ORG Holy See’s Assessor  ] [PER Peter Wells  ] ( protect strictly ) told [ORG DCM  ] , because they saw them as an affront to [LOC Vatican  ] sovereignty . 
[LOC Vatican  ] officials were also angered that the Government of [LOC Ireland  ] did not step in to direct the [ORG Murphy Commission  ] to follow standard procedures in communications with [LOC Vatican City  ] . 
Adding insult to injury , [LOC Vatican  ] officials also believed some [MISC Irish  ] opposition politicians were making political hay with the situation by calling publicly on the government to demand that the [LOC Vatican  ] reply . 
Ultimately , [LOC Vatican  ] Secretary of State ( Prime Minister equivalent ) [ORG Bertone  ] wrote to the [MISC Irish  ] Embassy that requests related to the investigation must come through diplomatic channels via letters rogatory. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [MISC Irish  ] Embassy to the [LOC Holy See  ] offered to facilitate better communications between the [MISC Irish  ] commission and the [LOC Holy See  ] , but neither party took any further action . 
[MISC Irish  ] Ambassador [PER Noel Fahey  ] ( formerly ambassador to [LOC Washington  ] ) told [ORG DCM  ] this was the most difficult crisis he had ever managed . 
The [MISC Irish  ] government wanted to be seen as cooperating with the investigation because its [ORG Education Department  ] was implicated , but did not want to insist that the [LOC Vatican  ] answer the requests because they had come outside of regular channels . 
In the end , the [MISC Irish  ] government decided not to press the [LOC Vatican  ] to reply , according to Fahey’s Deputy , [PER Helena Keleher  ] . 
Moreover , [PER Keleher  ] [LOC VATICAN  ] 00000033 002.2 OF 003 told [ORG Polchief  ] the [ORG CDF  ] probably did not have much to add to the inquiry . 
Regarding the request for the [ORG Nuncio  ] to testify , [PER Keleher  ] said the [ORG GOI  ] understood that foreign ambassadors are not required or expected to appear before national commissions . 
Nevertheless , [PER Keleher  ] thought the [ORG Nuncio  ] in [LOC Ireland  ] made things worse by simply ignoring the requests. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The resentment caused by the [ORG Murphy Commission  ] tactics - and failure of the Government of [LOC Ireland  ] to temper them -- now has worn off a little in [LOC Rome  ] . 
This is in part because the legal and diplomatic questions posed by the [ORG Commission’s  ] demands are now moot since the [ORG Murphy Commission  ] released its report in November 2009 . 
It substantiated many of the claims and also concluded that some bishops tried to cover up the abuses , putting the interests of the [MISC Church  ] ahead of those of the victims. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [MISC Irish  ] people’s anger , however , has not worn off . 
The refusal of the [LOC Holy See  ] to respond to the [ORG Murphy Commission  ] questions caused a furor of public disbelief in [LOC Ireland  ] when it became known . 
Foreign Minister [PER Martin  ] was forced to call in the Papal [ORG Nuncio  ] to discuss the situation . 
The [MISC Irish  ] public was not mollified . 
Resentment toward the [MISC Church  ] in [LOC Rome  ] remains very high , particularly because of the institutionalized cover-up of abuse by the [MISC Catholic Church  ] hierarchy . 
In the wake of the scandal , four of the five bishops named in the [ORG Murphy Report  ] have resigned ; the fifth has refused to quit . 
Archbishop [PER Martin’s Christmas Eve Midnight Mass  ] announcement of the resignation of two of the five key bishops named in the [ORG Murphy  ] report was met be thunderous applause , which he had a hard time quieting . 
Pastoral Reaction: Meetings with [ORG Clerics  ] and Messages to [MISC Catholics  ] --------------------------------------------- -------------- -------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Meanwhile , the normally cautious [LOC Vatican  ] moved with uncharacteristic speed to address the internal [MISC Church  ] crisis . 
The [PER Pope  ] convoked a meeting with senior [MISC Irish  ] clerical leaders on December 11 , 2009 . 
[MISC Irish  ] Cardinal [PER Sean Brady  ] and Archbishop of [LOC Dublin  ] [PER Diarmuid Martin  ] came to [LOC Rome  ] and met with the [LOC Pontiff  ] , who was flanked by Cardinal [ORG Bertone  ] ( the [LOC Vatican  ] Prime Minster equivalent ) , and four other Cardinals whose duties include oversight over some aspect of the [MISC Irish  ] situation . 
At the end of the meeting , the [LOC Vatican  ] issued a statement saying that the [PER Pope  ] shared the “outrage , betrayal , and shame” of [MISC Irish  ] [MISC Catholics  ] over the deliberations , that he was praying for the victims , and that the [MISC Church  ] would take steps to prevent recurrences . 
Archbishop [PER Martin  ] told reporters afterwards that he expected a major shake-up of the [MISC Church  ] in [LOC Ireland.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Vatican’s  ] next move was to call a broader , two-day meeting with [MISC Irish  ] bishops , February 15-16 , to discuss the crisis . 
There , the [PER Pope  ] urged the bishops to address the sexual abuse with resolve and courage , to prevent any recurrences , and to bring healing to the victims . 
Meeting participants examined and discussed a draft of the “Pastoral Letter of the Holy Father to the [MISC Catholics  ] of [MISC Ireland”  ] that the [PER Pope  ] will issue by the end of March . 
A later [LOC Vatican  ] statement said the abuses in [LOC Ireland  ] were a “heinous crime and also a grave sin.” <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) At a press conference on February 16 , [LOC Vatican  ] spokesman [PER Lombardi  ] said the meeting was aimed at dialogue and direction-setting , and was not intended to produce specific policy decisions . 
The statement quoted the bishops’ assurances that “significant measures have now been taken to ensure the safety of children and young people.” The full text is available at http://212.77.1.245/news services/bulletin/news/25154.php ? index=25154& po date=16.02.2010&lang=en Public Reaction: [ORG Vatican Response Helps  ] , but More Needed --------------------------------------------- ----------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C/NF ) Judging by media commentary , many non-Irish [MISC Catholics  ] felt the [ORG Vatican’s  ] response to the crisis was a good start but more was needed . 
[MISC Irish  ] Deputy Head of [PER Mission Keleher  ] told polchief on February 18 that she sympathized with victims’ groups’ criticism of the [LOC Vatican  ] statement , because it was not more focused on the pain caused to the victims . 
Victims’ associations also have complained that the [PER Pope  ] did not issue an apology for the abuses and that he did not order the removal of the remaining bishop accused of the cover-up . 
( Archbishop [PER Martin’s comments  ] in December apparently had convinced many that the [LOC Vatican  ] would remove the errant bishops if they did not quit . 
) [MISC Comment: Some Lessons Learned  ] , but [ORG Crisis Will Play Out for Years  ] --------------------------------------------- -------------------- [LOC VATICAN  ] 00000033 003.2 OF 003 <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) In keeping with the [MISC Catholic  ] practice of making local bishops ultimately responsible for the management of their dioceses , we expect that the locus of the crisis and measures to address it will remain largely with the [MISC Catholic  ] Church in [LOC Ireland  ] . 
One exception will be on decisions of whether to accept or reject resignation offers from the implicated bishops -- or the removal of the bishop who refused to offer his resignation -- which rest with the [PER Pope  ] . 
The other big exception will be the [MISC Pope’s  ] pastoral letter to [MISC Irish  ] [MISC Catholics  ] , in which the [LOC Vatican  ] may address concerns and criticisms about statements and actions undertaken to date . 
After this , though , the [LOC Vatican  ] will return to the background - while keeping an eye on the [MISC Irish  ] bishops and continuing to urge them to speak with one voice . 
Our contacts at the [LOC Vatican  ] and in [LOC Ireland  ] expect the crisis in the [MISC Irish  ] [MISC Catholic Church  ] to be protracted over several years , as only allegations from the [ORG Dublin Archdiocese  ] have been investigated to date . 
Investigations of allegations from other [ORG Archdioceses  ] will lead , officials in both states lament , to additional painful revelations. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) In [LOC Ireland  ] , these abuse scandals occurred at the end of a long period of increasing secularization of society - and may further reduce the influence of the [MISC Catholic  ] Church . 
Indeed , the great vehemence of the [MISC Irish  ] reaction to this crisis reflects how far the [MISC Catholic  ] Church in [LOC Ireland  ] has fallen . 
Once ensconced in the [MISC Irish  ] Constitution , the [MISC Irish Catholic  ] Church reached the height of its prestige and power with the 1979 visit of [PER Pope John Paul  ] II but it has been falling ever since . 
At the same time , the [ORG Murphy Report  ] reflects [MISC Irish  ] shame over the collaboration of [MISC Ireland’s  ] state bodies , including its schools , courts and police , in the appalling abuses and cover-up that occurred for decades. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [LOC Vatican  ] analysts , meanwhile , agree that the Holy See’s handling of the [MISC Irish  ] scandal shows the [LOC Vatican  ] learned some important lessons from the [LOC U.S.  ] sex abuse scandal of 2002 . 
By acting quickly to express horror at allegations , to label the alleged acts both crimes and sins , and to call in the local leaders to discuss how to prevent recurrences , the [LOC Vatican  ] limited - but certainly did not eliminate - the damage caused to the [ORG Church’s  ] standing in [LOC Ireland  ] and worldwide . 
Unfortunately , given the growing abuse scandal in [LOC Germany  ] , it may need to deploy those lessons again before long .
