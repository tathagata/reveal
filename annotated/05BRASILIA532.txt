[PER C. BRASILIA  ] 00464 Classified By: POLITICAL OFFICER BISOLA OJIKUTU . 
REASON: 1.4 ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary . 
On February 23 , [PER Poloff  ] met with [PER Perly Cipriano  ] , Under Secretary for [ORG Human Rights Promotion  ] at the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Secretariat  ] for [ORG Human Rights  ] , to discuss the [PER Dorothy Stang  ] murder case ( reftels A , B , and C ) . 
During the meeting , [PER Poloff  ] and [PER Cipriano  ] discussed [PER Stang  ] 's refusal to accept police protection , the involvement of the logging industry in [PER Stang  ] 's murder , violence in the region , and " federalizing " [PER Stang  ] 's murder case . 
[PER Poloff  ] also discussed [PER Stang  ] 's murder with the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Relations' Human Rights Division  ] . 
End summary . 
Police protection ----------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Refs reported the murder of [PER Dorothy Mae Stang  ] , a [LOC US  ] citizen and [MISC Catholic  ] nun , who was shot to death by three hired gunmen on February 12 near [LOC Anapu  ] , [LOC Para  ] . 
[PER Stang  ] lived in [LOC Brazil  ] for thirty years and was a well known agrarian reform activist . 
One week before her murder , [PER Stang  ] , [PER Cipriano  ] , and others from the [ORG Secretariat for Human Rights  ] met to discuss the ongoing conflict and [PER Stang  ] 's security . 
[PER Cipriano  ] spoke with [PER Poloff  ] at length about this meeting and how those who participated expressed their " deep concern " for [PER Stang  ] 's safety . 
Since [PER Stang  ] had received a number of death threats , the meeting 's participants offered police protection or entry into the [MISC Brazilian  ] witness protection program . 
[PER Stang  ] refused both offers because she strongly believed that her age , profession , and faith would protect her , according to [PER Cipriano  ] . 
The Logging Industry -------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Cipriano  ] stated that elements within the logging industry were responsible for [PER Stang  ] 's murder and refused to believe that other sectors could have been involved . 
Since " few could afford to pay [MISC R$50,000  ] ( approximately USD 20,000 ) to each hired gunman , " [PER Cipriano  ] and the [ORG GOB  ] believed that [PER Stang  ] 's murder was financed by a group of farm owners and loggers rather than one . 
( Note: There is no confirmation of [PER Cipriano  ] 's interpretation that the [MISC R$  ] 50,000 was offered to each gunman rather than a lump sum . 
End note . 
) This was based upon police and press reports in [LOC Anapu  ] that provided him information about a " group of financiers . 
" He thought that those responsible would be " captured in a few days . 
" ( Note: Press reports published days after our meeting supported this view . 
The police chief in charge of the [ORG Federal Police  ] investigation stated publicly that a number of loggers and land title falsifiers may have worked together to commit the crime . 
[ORG Federal Police  ] are now investigating names included in documents and letters sent by [PER Stang  ] to the [ORG Pastoral Land Commission  ] ( [ORG CPT  ] ) and to state and federal authorities . 
End note . 
) Local Violence -------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Immediately after [PER Stang  ] 's murder , senior [ORG GOB  ] officials spoke strongly against her murder and President [PER Lula  ] ordered the Justice Minister to send federal police to assist in the investigation . 
The violence in the days after her murder killed at least three , including a local leader of the landless community , and led to the deployment of Army troops to support state police . 
According to [PER Cipriano  ] , this violence was due to the " criminal element 's " reaction to the [ORG GOB  ] 's " tough " stance against the murder . 
In addition , he thought the violence was an attempt to force the [ORG GOB  ] against taking action which , he quickly responded , " we would never accept . 
" ( Note: Our sources told us that the violence and killings that occurred days after [PER Stang  ] 's murder are endemic to the region and do not appear to be directly related to [PER Stang  ] 's death . 
End note . 
) While he was quick to blame local criminals for [PER Stang  ] 's murder and local violence , [PER Cipriano  ] also blamed poor [LOC Para  ] state government regulation and the weak state judicial system . 
Federalization --------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) When asked about the status of federalizing [PER Stang  ] 's case , [PER Cipriano  ] stated that this decision rests with the [ORG Brazilian Supreme Court  ] . 
Since the law that allows case federalization is two months old , the [ORG GOB  ] " will tread carefully " on this issue since the outcome will influence other cases and set future precedence . 
[PER Cipriano  ] strongly believed that the [ORG Supreme Court  ] would federalize the case due to widespread international interest and evidence of local corruption that would hinder local judicial proceedings . 
( Note: On February 24 , Justice Minister [PER Bastos  ] publicly stated that he saw little need to federalize the case , as the state judge involved in the case has the [ORG GOB  ] 's confidence . 
End Note ) . 
[ORG Ministry of External Relations' Human Rights Division  ] --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In a separate meeting on February 22 , [PER Cristiano Figueiroa  ] from the [ORG Ministry of External Relations'  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) [ORG Human Rights Division  ] ( [ORG DDH  ] ) also spoke to [PER Poloff  ] about the [PER Stang  ] murder case . 
[PER Figueiroa  ] called the murder " a tragic and barbaric act " and " hoped that the [ORG GOB  ] 's actions and the judicial process would lead to an adequate and just solution . 
" According to [PER Figueiroa  ] , federalizing the case would lead to a more transparent judicial process and could ensure that the accused would be " brought to justice . 
" At the end of our meeting , [PER Cristiano  ] stated: " Ironically , one week before [PER Stang  ] 's death , the [ORG Human Rights Secretariat  ] launched a campaign in [LOC Para  ] to promote the same issues that [PER Stang  ] was fighting for . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Comment: Now that the investigation into [PER Stang  ] 's murder has slowed and both federal and state police have closed the investigation , it appears that the key question before the [ORG GOB  ] is whether or not the case should be federalized . 
[PER Cipriano  ] , [PER Figueiroa  ] , and other contacts that we have spoken to have little faith in state police officials and the local judicial process due to evidence of corruption and involvement of influential farmers and politicians in the judicial process . 
We agree with our contacts and believe that the case should be federalized to ensure a transparent and fair trial , but Justice Minister [PER Bastos' comments  ] ( paragraph 5 ) may foreshadow a [ORG GOB  ] decision to let the case run its course in [LOC Para  ] 's judicial system . 
Given the [ORG GOB  ] 's aggressive investigation of the killing and sensitivity to political perceptions of its handling of this high-profile crime , we are perplexed about the thinking behind [PER Bastos'  ] position and will make additional queries on that point . 
End Comment .
