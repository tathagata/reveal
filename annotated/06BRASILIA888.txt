( C ) Summary: [LOC Bolivia  ] agreed not to interrupt gas supplies to [LOC Brazil  ] , and [LOC Brazil  ] agreed to continue investing in [LOC Bolivia  ] 's hydrocarbon industry at the May 4 meeting in [LOC Puerto Iguazu  ] , [LOC Argentina  ] , according to the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] 's [LOC Bolivia  ] Desk Officer . 
This understanding has deterred an immediate crisis , he said . 
However , two potential crises loom on the horizon: 1 ) [LOC Bolivia  ] may impose a unilateral price increase ( such an intention has been reported in the press , but so far there has been no official notification ) and 2 ) [LOC Bolivia  ] could repossess some or all of the farms currently operated by 15,000 [MISC Brazilians  ] who moved into the [LOC Santa Cruz  ] region over the past twenty years . 
[LOC Brazil  ] hopes that a meeting between [ORG Petrobras  ] and [MISC Bolivian  ] officials later this week may move the issue back to the technical arena , reducing its political volatility . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] [MISC Bolivian  ] Desk Officer [PER Lauro de Castro Beltrao Filho  ] told poloff May 8 that the two private commitments made at the May 4 [LOC Puerto Iguazu  ] , [LOC Argentina  ] meeting justified President [PER Lula da Silva  ] 's characterization of the situation between [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Bolivia  ] as " not a crisis . 
" At the [LOC Puerto Iguazu  ] meeting , [MISC Bolivian  ] President [PER Morales  ] promised that he would not interrupt gas supplies to [LOC Brazil  ] , and President [PER Lula  ] promised that [LOC Brazil  ] would continue to invest in [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
However , [PER Beltrao  ] , cautioned , the commitment on investment is not airtight . 
[ORG Petrobras  ] , as a publicly traded company with thousands of private investors , will be the one to ultimately decide on investment issues consistent with future conditions . 
He added that , while there is no ongoing crisis , the situation remains serious and could develop into a crisis in the near future. --------------------------------------------- -------- Gas Prices , Agricultural Reform , Could [ORG Provoke Crisis  ] --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [LOC Bolivia  ] could foment a crisis in one of two ways . 
First , it could unilaterally impose a gas price increase . 
[PER Beltrao  ] noted that [LOC La Paz  ] had already publicly indicated an intention to raise prices by 61 percent , but the [LOC Brazil  ] side had received nothing official from [LOC Bolivia  ] in that regard . 
Since , according to the contract [ORG Petrobras  ] has with [LOC Bolivia  ] , the price of gas is to be decided by mutual agreement between both sides , a unilateral price increase would constitute a breach of contract . 
( He noted that an adjustment mechanism is built into the contract to allow prices to fluctuate yearly based on a market basket of goods , and that every five years or so , the two sides will engage in a more comprehensive renegotiation of the price . 
) [PER Beltrao  ] pointed out that regional gas prices had been gradually rising so [LOC Bolivia  ] might be justified in requesting a price increase . 
However , it would have to obtain agreement from [ORG Petrobras  ] before implementing an increase. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) A separate , but related , issue is the status of some 15,000 [MISC Brazilians  ] who moved into the [LOC Santa Cruz  ] area of [LOC Bolivia  ] over the past twenty years and who are currently growing soybeans on farms in the region . 
Most moved from neighboring regions in [LOC Brazil  ] , attracted by soil that is richer and land prices that are cheaper than those found on the [MISC Brazilian  ] side of the border . 
[PER Beltrao  ] noted that on the same day as the gas nationalization was announced , the [PER Morales  ] government also indicated its intention to carry our agricultural reforms that could affect those [MISC Brazilian  ] farmers . 
Any action taken that would threaten the rights of those farmers would occasion a public outcry in [LOC Brazil  ] , probably worse than that caused by the spectacle of [MISC Bolivian  ] soldiers occupying [ORG Petrobras  ] facilities . 
[PER Beltrao  ] noted that [MISC Brazilians  ] had been particularly shocked by that display , and he attributed much of the popular criticism of President [PER Lula  ] 's response to the outrage over those images. --------------------------------------------- Hoping to [MISC Move Focus Back  ] to Technical Issues --------------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) According to [PER Beltrao  ] , there will be a new round of talks over nationalization in [LOC Bolivia  ] this week . 
He said [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000888 002.2 OF 002 [ORG Petrobras  ] will conduct the talks , most likely without government participation , as [LOC Brazil  ] would like to return the issue to the technical arena , thereby turning down the political temperature . 
He said he was unaware whether [MISC Bolivian  ] Government officials would join [ORG YPFB  ] at the meeting. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Comment: Whether or not the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] is prepared to acknowledge a current " crisis " between [LOC Bolivia  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] , there clearly appears to be a crisis of confidence in [PER Lula  ] 's foreign policy team . 
Press criticism of the [PER Lula  ] adminstration continued over the weekend , with the largest newsmagazine pillorying President [PER Lula  ] 's chief foreign policy advisors for their handling of the [MISC Bolivian  ] episode , and several other international setbacks , labeling them at one point , " Sheep in Sheep 's Clothing .
