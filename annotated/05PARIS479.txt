These are the first arrests since the investigation of [MISC French  ] jihadists going to [LOC Iraq  ] was begun in September 2004 . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) After [MISC French  ] officials spent most of 2004 publicly denying that [MISC French  ] citizens might be going to [LOC Iraq  ] , the [LOC Paris  ] Prosecutor 's office ordered the opening of an investigation in September 2004 . 
Investigating judges [PER Jean-Louis Bruguiere  ] and [PER Jean-Francois Ricard  ] were given investigative authority . 
As reported reftel , the judges were initially cautioned to be circumspect in their investigations because of [LOC GOF  ] fear that the investigation might harm two [MISC French  ] journalists held hostage in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The hostages were released December 21 , 2004 . 
When last queried about the investigation in early January , [PER Ricard  ] told Poloff that the investigation was progressing , although authorities had no indication of a distinct " network " sending [MISC Islamic  ] radicals to [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Rather , they believed that the jihadists to [LOC Iraq  ] benefited from more informal support through local mosques and families. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) In a lunch hosted by the Ambassador on January 24 ( reported septel ) , [PER Bruguiere  ] revealed that several suspects had been arrested that morning in connection with the investigation . 
He added that in examining the case , he had come across reports of the involvement of minors as young as 13-years-old . 
Two days later , the [MISC French  ] press reported these arrests and added additional detail . 
According to the press reports , the DST ( [LOC France  ] 's internal security service ) arrested seven people on January 24 , three who were planning to go fight in [LOC Iraq  ] and four suspected of recruitment and fundraising . 
Two of the seven are reported to be women . 
The press reported that those arrested were affiliated with the [LOC Adda'wa  ] mosque in [LOC Paris'  ] 19th arrondisement . 
Four [MISC French  ] citizens reported killed in [LOC Iraq  ] had ties with mosques in the 19th arrondisement , and three of them had frequented the [LOC Adda'wa  ] mosque . 
An unnamed " high-level " [ORG Interior Ministry  ] official quoted in the reporting said police and security services benefited from increased surveillance powers included in the recently enacted [MISC Perben II  ] law . 
( Comment: This unnamed offical , probably a member of Interior Minister [PER Villepin  ] 's Cabinet , also lauded the counter-terrorism policies enacted by [PER Villepin  ] as being instrumental in the arrests . 
That is a stretch , given that [PER Villepin  ] did not figure in the passing of [MISC Perben II  ] or the assigning of the case to the counter-terrorism investigating judges . 
End comment . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) [PER Ricard  ] ( strictly protect ) told Poloff January 26 that , in addition to the seven arrested on January 24 , an additional four were arrested on January 26 . 
He said that none of those arrested was under 18 , although some would probably be implicated in recruiting minors for jihad in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Of the eleven arrested , he said 3-4 were of " special interest " to [MISC French  ] authorities . 
Depending on the results of the DST 's interrogations , the others would either be released or charged with relatively minor crimes . 
[PER Ricard  ] said the investigation was ongoing and could involve additional arrests. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 .
