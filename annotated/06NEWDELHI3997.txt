NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 3658 B. NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 3636 C. NEW [LOC DELHI  ] 3611 [PER D. STATE  ] 82566 Classified By: A/PolCouns Atul Keshap for Reasons 1.4 ( B , D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [ORG Summary:  ] The [ORG GOI  ] regards a bioterrorism attack as an event of such low probability that the potential impact does not register high on New Delhi’s agenda . 
We have no reason to believe terrorist organizations operating in [LOC India  ] have access to pathogens at this time ; also , bioterrorism is inconsistent with the strategy of most terrorist groups active in [LOC India  ] . 
Furthermore , terrorists’ fear of becoming a victim of such attacks themselves reduces the likelihood of a bioterrorism attack in the near future . 
However , the possibility of a bioterror attack cannot be ruled out. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Advances in the biotech sector and shifting terrorist tactics that focus on disrupting [MISC India’s  ] social cohesion and economic prosperity oblige the [ORG GOI  ] to look at the possibility of terror groups using biological agents as weapons of mass destruction and economic and social disruption . 
The plethora of indigenous highly pathogenic and virulent agents naturally occurring in [LOC India  ] and the large [MISC Indian  ] industrial base -- combined with weak controls -- also make [LOC India  ] as much a source of bioterrorism material as a target . 
In addition , [MISC India’s  ] notably weak public health and agricultural infrastructure coupled with high population density means that a deliberate release of a disease-causing agent could go undetected for quite a while before authorities become aware . 
According to the [ORG Ministry of Agriculture  ] , [LOC India  ] is particularly vulnerable to agriculture attacks . 
Moreover , lack of communication , coordination , and cooperation among key stakeholders from different sectors will continue to remain a major impediment to the GOI’s capacity to respond to a bioterrorism attack. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Fortunately , terrorist groups operating in [LOC India  ] are not focused on bioterror , according to [MISC Delhi-based  ] terrorism analysts , although [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us recently that the [ORG GOI  ] believes jihadi groups are seeking to recruit or employ biology/bio-tech PhD graduates from within [LOC India  ] ( Ref C ) . 
Recent indications of receptivity by [ORG GOI  ] interlocutors on biodefense cooperation and steps the [ORG GOI  ] seems to be taking to prepare for a possible bioterrorist attack ( [PER Refs B-D  ] and Septel ) may presage the writing of a new chapter in [MISC India’s  ] counterterrorism preparedness and in [LOC US-India CT  ] cooperation . 
End Summary . 
Just Waking Up to the Threat ---------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In recent meetings with [ORG GOI  ] representatives and [MISC Indian  ] scientists , two themes emerged regarding the bioterror NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00003997 002 OF 009 threat: [MISC India’s  ] public health and agriculture surveillance systems are sorely lacking , and the [ORG GOI  ] is currently ill-equipped to prepare for or respond to a bioterrorism attack . 
Representatives from the [ORG Agriculture and Health Ministries  ] , the [ORG National Disaster Management Authority  ] ( [ORG NDMA  ] ) , and law enforcement were all quick to point out the weaknesses in the various disease surveillance systems , noting there is no well-established collection of baseline epidemiological information/data ( naturally occurring disease burden ) which is needed for [LOC India  ] to distinguish between a natural outbreak and a terrorist attack . 
Given the number of diseases endemic to [LOC India  ] , the [ORG GOI  ] would have a hard time differentiating between a newly emerging or re-emerging disease and a bioterrorism attack . 
Additionally , while individuals within various ministries are cognizant of the extent of the threat to [LOC India  ] , there does not appear to be strong movement to shore up vulnerabilities or have key stakeholders move outside their traditional lanes . 
The appearance of highly pathogenic avian influenza ( HPAI ) , H5N1 strain , within [MISC India’s  ] borders may change [MISC India’s  ] views on the need to prepare . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , for example , made the extrapolation between the country’s capacity to deal with a newly emerging disease and the implications for its ability to respond to bioterrorism . 
Most [ORG GOI  ] interlocutors seemed unaware that executing a biological terrorist attack ( i.e. obtaining and releasing pathogens ) requires far less sophistication than executing a chemical or nuclear terrorist attack . 
Biological Attack Potentially Devastating ----------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The impact of a biological attack or the accidental release of a disease-causing agent in [LOC India  ] could be devastating , given the high population density in [MISC Indian  ] cities and the growing mobility of [MISC India’s  ] middle class . 
Most biological warfare ( [ORG BW  ] ) agents do not produce symptoms for many hours or several days , so [MISC Indians  ] exposed to a contagious [ORG BW  ] agent could easily spread the agent to thousands before symptoms manifest . 
Release in an [MISC Indian  ] city could facilitate international spread -- [LOC Delhi  ] airport alone sees planes depart daily to numerous [MISC European  ] , [MISC Asian  ] , [ORG Middle Eastern  ] and [MISC African  ] destinations , as well as non-stop flights to [LOC Chicago  ] and [LOC Newark  ] . 
But [MISC GOI Says  ] [LOC India  ] Not Ready For [MISC Bioterrorism  ] --------------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In early May meetings , [ORG GOI  ] officials indicated to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [PER Poloff  ] that [LOC Delhi  ] is neither ready for nor focusing on bioterrorism or biodefense ; [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [LOC Poloff  ] were struck by the frank admissions from some interlocutors . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] indicated that detection and protection of “soft systems” like the logistics chains for food , milk , and water delivery are “inadequate” in the face of a determined terrorist . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated frankly that New [LOC Delhi  ] is ill-prepared to handle a bioterrorist attack: “The government does not have the requisite experience.” “The terrorists have surprise on their side , we need more preparation , and we need more scientists working with police , who typically focus more on ( conventional ) terrorism investigations than on protection and response , ” [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] added. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was unconvincing in his assertion that the [ORG GOI  ] has biodefense well in hand . 
As with criminal matters , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] indicated that disaster management in [LOC India  ] begins at the local government level . 
Districts and municipalities must then appeal to state governments to assist in situations beyond their capacity to control , and states to the federal government -- processes that could cause critical delays in a fast-moving attack or disaster situation . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] At [LOC Best  ] , A [ORG Third-Tier Priority  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was candid , however , that biodefense was his third priority after chemical and nuclear/radiological incidents . 
He also mentioned that the [ORG NDMA  ] was planning chemical and nuclear disaster response exercises in the coming weeks , but had no plans as yet to conduct a biological disaster response exercise , let alone one that focused on a bioterror attack . 
( [PER NOTE: EmbOffs  ] noticed that XXXXXXXXXXXX’s comments frequently returned to chemical/nuclear accident response despite their questions on biological terrorism response . 
Furthermore , he never mentioned , and may be completely unaware , of [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , suggesting poor knowledge-sharing and coordination within the [ORG GOI  ] on bioterror defense . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
End Note . 
) . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] turned down XXXXXXXXXXXX’s reiteration of the [ORG USG  ] proposal for support for a [ORG GOI  ] ( or joint [MISC US-India  ] ) bioterrorism exercise ( see Para 24 ) , saying [LOC India  ] was “not yet ready” ; he appeared unenthusiastic , though not immediately dismissive , of [MISC Poloff’s  ] request that the [ORG NDMA  ] invite relevant Embassy officers to view the exercises the NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00003997 004 OF 009 [ORG NDMA  ] already has planned. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Contradicting his earlier assertion , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] gave a frank assessment of [MISC India’s  ] ability to respond to a major biological attack or disaster . 
Less than two percent of the [LOC Uttar Pradesh  ] and [LOC Bihar  ] state budgets go for health , for example , which means that village-level health care in [LOC UP  ] , [MISC India’s  ] most populous state with over 130 million inhabitants , is scant ; nor are there sufficient veterinary facilities in these two agriculture-dependent states . 
He bemoaned the fact that the public health sector was slow to benefit from private sector biotechnology advances . 
Opportunity: Terrorism/Natural Outbreak Overlap --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] both agreed that [LOC India  ] would derive a dual benefit from improved disease surveillance and biodefense preparations that could counter either a bioterrorism attack or a natural disease outbreak . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] shared with us that some of his police and security colleagues had speculated that AI in [LOC India  ] was initially introduced as a bioterrorism attack , or as a test by terrorists of their ( purported ) bioterrorism capabilities and a probe of [MISC Indian  ] defenses and response . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] pointed out that , rather than acquire exotic [ORG BW  ] agents , terrorists operating in [LOC India  ] have access to a number of naturally-occurring disease-causing agents that could be easily spread in food or water supplies , such as cholera ; according to technical literature , 70% of naturally occurring multi-antibiotic resistant bacteria are found in [LOC India  ] . 
Although many [ORG BW  ] agents are sensitive to large-scale dilution in a municipal water supply , they would be well suited for use in smaller bodies of water common in [LOC India  ] , such as a small apartment complex’s water tank , urban water trucks that service middle-class communities in the summertime , or a rural well ; cholera outbreaks are an annual summer event in [LOC Delhi  ] . 
Food Defense Resonates ---------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Noting the [ORG GOI  ] interest especially in food supply protection , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] informed [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] of the September 25-29 FBI-Joint Terrorism [ORG Task Force International Symposium  ] on [MISC Agro-Terrorism  ] . 
[ORG CBI  ] later requested further information from the Embassy on the symposium , indicating possible [ORG CBI  ] participation. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] found a receptive audience with [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , who voiced concerns over vulnerabilities to agriculture and the food supply , noting not only the obvious health consequences of any outbreak or contamination , but also emphasizing the direct economic impact . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] mentioned that NEW [LOC DELHI  ] 00003997 005 OF 009 when the AI outbreak first occurred , the [ORG GOI  ] was initially concerned that the public health sector would face a secondary health crisis -- malnutrition due to loss of the primary protein source . 
He suggested the [ORG USG  ] consider in the food defense discussion including aquaculture , the water supply , and the use of water in food preparation and production . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also noted [MISC GOI’s  ] overall weaknesses in agricultural disease surveillance and detection . 
Furthermore , he indicated the [ORG GOI  ] did not have baseline data which could help determine whether an outbreak was newly emerging or a result of deliberate introduction . 
Stovepiping Hinders [ORG Inter-Agency Cooperation  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Discussions with [ORG GOI  ] officials indicate bureaucratic inertia among the various ministries to interact with each other on these issues , which may impede the [MISC GOI’s  ] ability to prepare for , and respond to , an act of bioterrorism . 
One sign seemed to be the inclusion of only [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] inXXXXXXXXXXXX meeting on bioterrorism when the [ORG USG  ] proposals on food defense and increasing awareness and communication at the sub-federal level ( reiterated to the [ORG MEA  ] at the April 19 [ORG US-India Counterterrorism Joint Working Group  ] meeting in [LOC Washington  ] ) clearly would necessitate broader interagency participation , especially law enforcement and agriculture . 
The [ORG Agriculture Ministry XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] expressed a keen interest in learning more about the recent [MISC US-India  ] biosafety and pathogen security workshop in [LOC Pune  ] , yet indicated that no one in the [ORG Ministry of Agriculture  ] was able to attend . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX Perhaps  ] the formation of the [ORG NDMA  ] will help eliminate some stovepipes as [ORG NDMA  ] develops [MISC GOI’s  ] bioterrorism preparedness strategy . 
Regardless , there remains a clear need to encourage multi-sectoral [ORG GOI  ] engagement in preparation for , or response to , a bioterrorism attack . 
Access to Biomaterials “Not Very Difficult” ------------------------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [PER Poloff  ] the difficulty of manufacturing biological weapons is offset in [LOC India  ] by the relative ease of procuring biological materials such as harmful bacteria , parasites , viruses or toxins that either exist naturally or are cultured in academic labs that maintain loose supervision. “It would be unlikely that a bio-agent is brought in by terrorists from outside the country if it can be easily obtained within [LOC India  ] itself , ” added [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ; “Getting into a facility to obtain NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00003997 006 OF 009 lethal bio-agents is not very difficult here.” ( [ORG COMMENT: Biological  ] agents do not require sophisticated weaponization for dispersal . 
Food and water supplies can be tainted or a “typhoid [MISC Mary”  ] scenario could be employed . 
End Comment . 
) <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] echoed XXXXXXXXXXXX’s assessment that academic facilities maintain very loose security procedures ; basic entry barriers exist , but monitoring is not stringent. “The harsh reality is that you can bribe a guard with a pack of cigarettes to get inside” , said [ORG Lele.  ] “A disgruntled scientist who has been working in [LOC India  ] in his lab for several years without a promotion is a good candidate for bribing , ” he added. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) A March 21 “Indian Express” article quoted [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] as having requested ( and obtained ) police protection from angry poultry farmers whom he feared would attack the lab to retaliate for the lab’s detection of the H5N1 avian influenza virus that led to the farmers having to cull their flocks . 
The article concluded: “Contrary to the image its name evokes , the lab has almost zero security . 
A couple of guards , armed only with batons , man the entrance of the laboratory.” <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG SciOff  ] has also seen photographs taken by a senior [MISC Indian  ] army officer , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , from his tour of what he called “frontline field laboratories for diagnostics of infectious diseases.” The photographs demonstrated a host of poor laboratory security and safety practices , including families sleeping in labs and disposable gloves being washed for re-use or being disposed of as non-hazardous biological waste ( Ref A ) . 
A Source of [ORG Biological Agents  ] for [MISC External Attacks  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) Terrorists planning attacks anywhere in the world could use [MISC India’s  ] advanced biotechnology industry and large bio-medical research community as potential sources of biological agents . 
Given the strong web of air connections [LOC Delhi  ] shares with the rest of the world and the vulnerabilities that might be exploited at airports , a witting or unwitting person could easily take hazardous materials into or out of the country . 
( NOTE: The [MISC British  ] High Commission’s air security officer noted that checked luggage is inspected well away from the airline check-in desks , and hand luggage is only inspected just before the departure gates ; passengers could easily slip contraband from hand luggage into an exterior pouch in already-inspected checked luggage en route to the check-in desk , whence it is not inspected arrival at the passenger’s destination . 
End Note . 
) NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00003997 007 OF 009 Over-the-Horizon Threats an Enduring [MISC Indian  ] Blind Spot --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) The [MISC GOI’s  ] level of preparedness to combat bioterror attacks may be attributed in part to what the dean of [MISC India’s  ] strategic establishment and former Defense Secretary [PER K Subrahmanyan  ] calls the “Panipat Syndrome , ” an [MISC Indian  ] tradition of not anticipating strategic threats . 
( NOTE: According to [PER Subrahmanyan  ] in three separate decisive battles , [MISC Indian  ] empires declined to defend themselves against [MISC Western  ] invaders by reinforcing strategic choke-points like the Khyber Pass . 
They instead waited for the advancing force to reach [LOC Panipat  ] -- a town only 40 miles from [LOC Delhi  ] , and over 450 miles after penetrating the Khyber -- before reacting. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) XXXXXXXXXXXX’s comments provide a case in point . 
To place his priority list in context , the December 1984 [LOC Bhopal  ] accident still looms large in [MISC India’s  ] psyche ; although [LOC India  ] has not suffered a nuclear disaster , the [ORG GOI  ] has viewed from a distance the examples of [LOC Chernobyl  ] and [LOC Three Mile Island  ] , reminders of potential disasters that might await [MISC India’s  ] own civil nuclear program . 
In contrast , biological threats belong almost solely to the realm of the possible -- they come last because there has been no correspondingly dire biological attack or accident to focus Delhi’s attention . 
The closest [LOC India  ] came to bioterrorism was a late 2001 series of [PER Anthrax  ] attacks that turned out to be a hoax . 
When [PER Poloff  ] asked [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] about the series of [MISC MEA-funded  ] books on bioterrorism that IPCS edited and published , he remarked , “Yes , but only [MISC Europeans  ] actually buy the books , [MISC Indians  ] don’t.” Luckily , Not On ( Most ) Terrorists’ Radar Yet , Either --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) Bioterrorism would at most appeal to the larger jihadi terrorist groups such as [ORG Lashkar-e-Tayyiba  ] ( LeT ) and [ORG Jaish-e-Mohammad  ] ( [ORG JeM  ] ) -- XXXXXXXXXXXXtold us recently that the [ORG GOI  ] believes jihadi groups are seeking to recruit or employ biology/bio-tech PhD graduates with an aim to carrying out bioterrorist attacks ( Ref C ) . 
Naxals and [MISC Northeast  ] separatist terrorists rely heavily on local support , their area of operations is limited to the territory they seek to “liberate , ” and they lack operational reach into major cities like [LOC Delhi  ] , [LOC Pune  ] , [LOC Hyderabad  ] and [LOC Bangalore  ] -- all factors that suggest they would not seek to employ bioterrorism. “Groups like al-Qa’ida and its affiliates like LeT and [ORG JeM  ] , who are fighting for a religious cause , are more likely to indulge in the use of [ORG BW  ] since they are not concerned about popular support , ” [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] suggested . 
He claimed that such groups already possess the combination of expertise and contacts to gain access to harmful bio-agents . 
Even if terrorist groups active in [LOC India  ] do not yet possess in-house [ORG BW  ] capabilities , [LOC India  ] boasts more capable NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00003997 008 OF 009 biological scientists -- well in the thousands -- than any other developing country . 
Recruitment of [MISC Indian  ] scientists by anti-US extremists , either for ideological brotherhood or for commercial gain , could pose a significant threat . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] terrorism analyst [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that jihadis over the past year have shown they can adapt to using novel tactics and targeting economic and scientific institutions that fuel [MISC India’s  ] engines of growth and prosperity ; under this rubric , a bioterrorism attack could wreak havoc with [MISC India’s  ] economy and cripple investor confidence . 
[ORG GOI  ] Starting to Take Action ? ---------------------------- <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) According to a short April 28 article on “newindpress.com , ” Home Secretary [PER VK Duggal  ] in April asked Health Secretary [PER Prasanna Hota  ] to assist in preparing a manual on standard operating procedures for bioterrorism attacks response . 
The article also stated that [ORG Health Ministry  ] Director ( General Health Services ) [PER SK Srivastava  ] would create a technical committee to assess other countries’ best practices in bioterrorism preparedness and prevention . 
There was no indication in the article of what timelines the Home and Health Ministries are following ; none of our interlocutors mentioned this initiative to us . 
Comment: Wake Up and Smell the Biohazard ---------------------------------------- <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( C ) Strategies to improve public health human and animal sectors are vital for the [ORG GOI  ] , as are enforced regulations to safeguard biological materials . 
New [LOC Delhi  ] needs to be more aggressive in laying out solid actionable plans to implement biosecurity and public health improvements. <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( C ) As a [MISC US-India  ] CTJWG agenda item , a bioterrorism exercise is one of the most politically sensitive issues for the [ORG GOI  ] . 
Many other countries are also ill-prepared to address a bioterrorism attack ; however , few live in the kind of dangerous neighborhood that [LOC India  ] does , where terrorism , lax security , petty corruption , high population density , weak public health and agricultural infrastructures , and a booming and sophisticated biotech industry coexist . 
New Delhi’s past concern over displaying their lack of preparation on biodefense was possibly a determinant in the [ORG GOI  ] having declined to follow-through on a joint bioterrorism exercise despite the [ORG Home Ministry  ] having initiated the request in 2004 . 
In contrast , their current apparent receptivity to a bioterrorism tabletop exercise ( articulated by [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] at the April 19 CTJWG in [LOC Washington  ] ) , if SIPDIS it comes to fruition , will be a significant demonstration of trust and confidence in this element of the evolving [LOC CT  ] partnership with the [MISC USG.  ] <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 .
