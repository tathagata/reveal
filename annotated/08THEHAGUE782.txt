( [ORG S/NF  ] ) SUMMARY: In a productive meeting with the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG Finance Ministry  ] ( [ORG MoF  ] ) and [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] ( [ORG MFA  ] ) , [ORG Treasury  ] [PER U/S Levey  ] discussed [LOC Iran  ] 's efforts to circumvent international financial sanctions . 
The [ORG MoF  ] 's number three official , [PER Ronald Gerritse  ] , engaged as [PER U/S Levey  ] spoke about [ORG Credit Europe  ] ( a bank operating in the [LOC Netherlands  ] that is facilitating transactions for [MISC Iranian  ] banks ) and the need to target parts of the insurance sector vulnerable to [MISC Iranian  ] deception . 
[PER Gerritse  ] told [PER U/S Levey  ] that [ORG MoF  ] would follow up vigorously with relevant [MISC Dutch  ] financial regulators on all issues raised . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Treasury  ] Under Secretary for [ORG Terrorism  ] and Financial Intelligence [PER Stuart Levey  ] and [ORG Treasury  ] officials [PER Molly Millerwise  ] and [PER Jonathan Burke  ] met with [MISC Dutch  ] government officials September 12 to discuss efforts to prevent [LOC Iran  ] from evading financial sanctions . 
[PER Ronald Gerritse  ] , [ORG MoF  ] Secretary General and Treasurer , led the [MISC Dutch  ] side . 
[PER Andre van Wiggen  ] , [ORG MFA  ] Deputy Director of the [ORG Terrorism  ] and [MISC New Threats Unit  ] , and sanctions experts from [ORG MoF  ] and [ORG MFA  ] joined [ORG Gerritse.  ] --------------------------------------------- -------- Warning on Banks that Facilitate [MISC Iranian  ] Transactions --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER U/S Levey  ] described his visit to the [LOC Netherlands  ] as part of a series of conversations with governments and financial institutions regarding the few [MISC European  ] banks that still provide payment services to [MISC Iranian  ] entities . 
He praised the multilateral coalition that has worked in recent years to enforce international sanctions on [LOC Iran  ] . 
However , he said , [LOC Iran  ] continues to evade the sanctions , victimizing financial institutions that have borne the brunt of this illicit conduct ( a reference to [ORG ABN Amro  ] , a [MISC Dutch  ] bank ) . 
[PER U/S Levey  ] said most [MISC European  ] banks have decided to forego Iran-related business because it is too risky , but one of the few exceptions is [ORG Credit Europe  ] ( a Turkish-owned bank operating under a [MISC Dutch  ] license ) . 
He shared information with [PER Gerritse  ] suggesting [ORG Credit Europe  ] has played a role in providing significant volume of payment services to [LOC Iran  ] and had been involved in some illicit transactions with [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Gerritse  ] was disconcerted by this information and asked whether [PER U/S Levey  ] thought [ORG Credit Europe  ] had played this role willingly . 
[PER U/S Levey  ] said no , he assumed that [ORG Credit Europe  ] was not conspiring with [LOC Iran  ] , but that the payment services business exposed the bank to serious risk . 
[PER Gerritse  ] indicated he thought the banking supervisors at the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG Central Bank  ] ( [ORG DNB  ] ) were already scrutinizing [ORG Credit Europe  ] and he would ensure they followed up on the matter diligently. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER U/S Levey  ] stressed the need for [MISC European  ] banks to exercise great vigilance in dealing with any [MISC Iranian  ] bank , including the [ORG Central Bank of Iran  ] , as they could unwittingly involve themselves in efforts to circumvent sanctions . 
He described a scheme [ORG Bank Sepah  ] employed to disguise payments as innocuous transactions . 
He said financial institutions acting as high-volume correspondent banks ( rather than handling only their own customers' transactions ) would inevitably handle transactions that violate the law . 
[PER U/S Levey  ] agreed that performing detailed due diligence on each transaction of this type might not be efficient but , as the burden of proof has shifted , correspondent banks could no longer take for granted what transactions purported to be . 
[PER Gerritse  ] assured [PER U/S Levey  ] that the [ORG MoF  ] would take up this point with [LOC DNB.  ] -------------------------------------- [MISC New Focus  ] on [LOC Insurance Industry  ] 's Role -------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER U/S Levey  ] also raised the issue of the insurance industry 's vulnerability to deceptive [MISC Iranian  ] practices . 
He noted that the international community had not scrutinized the insurance industry as it did the banking sector in implementing [ORG UN Security Council  ] resolutions prohibiting the provision of financial services to [LOC Iran  ] . 
Specifically , he described how insurance supported [LOC Islamic Republic of  ] [ORG Iran Shipping Lines  ] ( [ORG IRISL  ] ) , which [ORG Treasury  ] had designated September 10 for its illicit proliferation activity . 
[PER Gerritse  ] asked whether targeting [ORG IRISL  ] 's insurance providers would have a knock-on effect in the oil market . 
[PER U/S Levey  ] responded that a separate [MISC Iranian  ] shipping company handled all of [LOC Iran  ] 's oil , so focusing on [ORG IRISL  ] 's bad conduct should not affect the oil market . 
THE HAGUE 00000782 002 OF 002 --------------------------------------------- --------- Firm [ORG Dutch Commitment  ] to Enforcing Financial Sanctions --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Gerritse  ] assured [PER Levey  ] that the [LOC Netherlands  ] was very much in line with the [LOC United States  ] on the issues of terrorism finance and [LOC Iran  ] . 
He committed to have Finance Minister [PER Wouter Bos  ] take up the [ORG Credit Europe  ] and insurance issues with the head of [ORG DNB  ] . 
[PER U/S Levey  ] expressed his interest in discussing the [ORG Credit Europe  ] case in greater detail in the future. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) [PER U/S Levey  ] has cleared this cable .
