( C ) SUMMARY . 
In accordance with ref a instructions , Post has conducted an extensive review of [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Air Bridge Denial  ] ( [ORG ABD  ] ) /Shootdown program . 
Building on the information received from the [ORG GOB  ] last year ( ref c ) and the importance ref a placed on confirming that [MISC Brazilian  ] procedures as provided to the [ORG USG  ] are in use , [ORG Mission Brazil  ] members have visited several [ORG Air Traffic Control  ] sites and conducted interviews with [MISC Brazilian  ] personnel . 
In doing so , [ORG Mission  ] has focused on two incidents in which the appropriate procedures were followed . 
Based on these activities , [ORG Mission  ] is confident that there has been no deterioration in [MISC Brazilian  ] safety standards over the last year and recommends that the Presidential Determination on the [MISC Brazilian  ] Shootdown Law be renewed for 2009 . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Post remains engaged with the Government of [LOC Brazil  ] to maintain confidence that [LOC Brazil  ] 's safety procedures for its [ORG ABD  ] provide protection against innocent loss of life in connection with interdiction . 
Based on evaluations of [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG ABD  ] program , the President has been able to certify annually since 2004 . 
As part of its annual review , post has conducted several visits to air traffic control centers , including three of the four air traffic control centers ( [ORG CINDACTAS  ] ) and met with [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Air Force  ] leadership on multiple occasions . 
As a result of these meetings , we are able to confirm that the procedures provided in 2008 , as elaborated in the 2004 exchange of notes , are still in force . 
In response to ref a requests for additional oversight of the [ORG ABD  ] program , [ORG Mission  ] members met with [MISC Brazilian  ] officials about several incidents occurring over the past year in order to analyze the practical application of [LOC Brazil  ] , s procedures . 
Visits ------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In the past year , [ORG Mission  ] officers visited the [ORG CINDACTAs  ] in [LOC Brasilia  ] , [LOC Manaus  ] and [LOC Recife  ] . 
[LOC Brasilia  ] and [LOC Manaus  ] were also visited for the 2008 certification ( ref c ) , and [ORG Mission  ] officers reported that this year , s visits revealed no changes in the operations and that [ORG CINDACTA  ] personnel remained familiar with proper safety procedures and the decision chain for [ORG ABD  ] incidents . 
In June , [LOC Mission Brazil  ] was able to make the first visit to the [LOC Recife  ] ( [ORG CINDACTA  ] 3 ) in over three years . 
USMLO officers worked closely with [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Air Traffic Control  ] to coordinate search operations for an [ORG Air France  ] airliner that had disappeared over the [LOC Atlantic  ] . 
As a result of close coordination , [ORG Mission  ] can report that there is a high degree of familiarity with proper safety procedures at the [ORG CINDACTA  ] . 
Local personnel stated clearly that they had no possibility to take any decision regarding a potential shootdown . 
Indeed the decision tree for the [ORG ABD  ] program , requiring [ORG COMDABRA  ] notification and decisions by the [ORG Air Force Command  ] and the [LOC Presidency  ] , was clearly posted at the [ORG CINDACTA  ] . 
[LOC Recife  ] controllers have a real time data link with [ORG COMDABRA  ] and will pass all data feeds there for decision during any [ORG ABD  ] event . 
At all three [ORG CINDACTAs  ] visited , personnel confirmed that the procedures provided in 2008 are still in force. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In addition to the [ORG CINDACTA  ] visits , [ORG Air Force Attache  ] visited the control tower in [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] international airport in June 2009 ( ref d ) . 
He reported a modern facility with full data connections to the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Air Traffic  ] control system . 
Incidents ---------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In order to improve confidence in [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG ABD  ] safety standards , [ORG Mission  ] has conducted analyses of two separate incidents in which the procedures were invoked . 
In the first ( refs e and f ) , a stolen plane in a nearby city could have threatened [LOC Brasilia  ] on March 12 . 
In this case , [ORG COMDABRA  ] leadership contacted [ORG Air Force  ] Commander [PER Saito  ] , who then briefed Defense Minister [PER Jobim  ] and President [PER Lula  ] . 
The plane crashed before the [ORG Air Force  ] considered whether to request authorization to use force , although [ORG Air Force  ] aircraft had intercepted it and were attempting to communicate . 
In subsequent meetings with [ORG COMDABRA  ] personnel , [ORG Mission  ] received a detailed description of the incident , which included step by step compliance with the [ORG GOB  ] procedures . 
It was noted , however , that while the shootdown notification procedures were used to inform national command authorities , the [MISC Brazilian  ] shootdown law applies only to aircraft reasonably suspected of carrying drugs , not mentally unbalanced amateur pilots . 
Given this fact , the March 12 incident should be regarded as a validation of the [ORG GOB  ] , s information mechanism rather than an actual shootdown situation. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In the second incident , on June 5 , 2009 , [MISC Brazilian  ] aircraft intercepted a drug-carrying plane entering [MISC Brazilian  ] airspace from [LOC Bolivia  ] , warned it to change course and land and , when this request was ignored , fired warning shots , forcing the plane down . 
Almost 400 pounds of cocaine were discovered . 
[ORG Air Force  ] attache discussed the incident with [ORG COMDABRA  ] and ascertained that the proper procedures were again followed meticulously . 
This was further confirmed in a televised interview with [ORG COMDABRA  ] commander [PER Brig Macado  ] , who described the necessity of 1 ) ensuring that the plane was engaged in drug trafficking , 2 ) a Presidential decision to use lethal force and 3 ) not considering a shootdown near populated areas . 
Our inquiries into these cases provide strong evidence that the [MISC Brazilian  ] procedures , as explained by the 2004 exchange of notes , remain in effect . 
[ORG COMDABRA  ] Visit -------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Post was not able to conduct the annual meeting at [ORG COMDABRA  ] as request in ref a . 
The request for the meeting was denied by [MISC Brazilian  ] authorities . 
Post believes that the reason for this was the failure of [ORG U.S. Air Force  ] officials to complete administrative arrangements for a [MISC Brazilian  ] visit to [ORG NORAD  ] . 
Given [MISC Brazilian  ] sensitivities about foreign access to their facilities and the importance [LOC Brazil  ] places on reciprocity , it is likely post , s request was denied pending a [MISC Brazilian  ] visit to a [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC ATC  ] site . 
Although the standard annual meeting did not occur , post has had regular contacts with [ORG COMDABRA  ] and believes that a recommendation for recertification is justified based on the information coordination with [ORG COMDABRA  ] following the incidents described in paragraphs 5 and 6 as well as the complete lack of any evidence of deterioration in [LOC Brazil  ] , s safety standards . 
Procedures ---------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Ref a describes [ORG USG  ] knowledge of [MISC Brazilian  ] procedures as &indirect8 because the explanations given in the 2004 exchange of notes between the [ORG USG  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] are more detailed than the official written procedures provided in 2008 ( ref c ) and directs post to seek access to [MISC Brazilian  ] classified supplements . 
Once again , [MISC Brazilian  ] authorities are not able to hand over their classified information , which , according to them , primarily concerns radio codes and other internal information . 
Post notes that the [ORG USG  ] has been able to certify annually since 2004 without access to these classified documents and does not believe their unavailability is any grounds for not certifying in 2009 . 
PROGRAM STATISTICS ------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Air Force  ] is compiling this year 's statistics on the shootdown program . 
Post will forward these via septel as soon as they become available . 
Recommendation -------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) 8 . 
( C ) As noted in ref c , [LOC Brazil  ] has maintained adequate safety standards since its shootdown law came into effect . 
After conducting our annual evaluation of [LOC Brazil  ] 's program , we believe that the appropriate safety procedures remain in place . 
With visits to the three [ORG CINDACTAs  ] most likely to be engaged in interdiction of drug trafficking and discussions of actual implementation of the [ORG GOB  ] procedures , we believe that a high degree of confidence in [MISC Brazilian  ] safety standards should be maintained . 
Post therefore recommends that the Presidential Determination on the [MISC Brazilian  ] Shootdown Law be renewed for 2009 .
