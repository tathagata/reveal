( C ) Summary: In a February 2 meeting , Director of the [LOC White House Office  ] of [ORG National Drug Control Policy  ] ( [ORG ONDCP  ] ) R. [PER Gil Kerlikowske  ] joined by Ambassador [PER Wayne  ] , discussed a range of current issues with [MISC Afghan  ] Minister of Interior [PER Hanif Atmar  ] . 
[PER Atmar  ] expressed satisfaction with the steady development of the [MISC Major Crimes Task Force  ] ( [ORG MCTF  ] ) , especially on corruption , but hoped to see more progress on kidnapping , an area where the [MISC GIRoA  ] needed better intelligence . 
[PER Atmar  ] hoped to begin sending 12-15,000 [ORG Afghan National Police  ] ( [ORG ANP  ] ) to train outside of [LOC Afghanistan  ] each year , and to receive [ORG NATO  ] funding and support to use a training facility constructed in [LOC Jordan  ] for training [MISC Iraqi  ] police for [MISC Afghan  ] police officers . 
[PER Atmar  ] commended [ORG DEA  ] 's success in developing elite , vetted units of the [ORG Counternarcotics Police  ] of [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( [ORG CNPA  ] ) , supported expansion of the [ORG CNPA  ] eradication force despite the termination of the [MISC U.S.-funded Poppy Eradication Force  ] ; and welcomed greater [LOC U.S.  ] and coalition support to develop [ORG CNPA  ] investigative capacity at the provincial level . 
[PER Atmar  ] was supportive of existing limited training exchanges with [LOC Russia  ] , noting that other regional relationships would be more effective if pursued through a subject-specific task force structure , and requested [LOC U.S.  ] support in pursuing such an approach with [LOC Pakistan  ] ( which [PER Kerlikowske  ] agreed to convey to [ORG FBI  ] Director [PER Mueller  ] ) . 
He also commented on recent raids against hawalas ( reftel ) . 
End Summary . 
[MISC MAJOR CRIMES TASK FORCE  ] ------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Minister [PER Atmar  ] expressed satisfaction with progress on the [MISC Major Crimes Task Force  ] ( [ORG MCTF  ] ) , observing that it was slowly emerging as a key law enforcement institution in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and that he was working with the [ORG FBI  ] as well as the [LOC UK  ] Serious [ORG Organised Crime Agency  ] ( [ORG SOCA  ] ) to accelerate progress . 
While good progress had been made on the [ORG MCTF Corruption  ] and Kidnapping Units , not as much progress had been made on specific kidnapping cases , which require better intelligence assets than the [MISC Afghan  ] government currently possesses . 
POLICE: LOOKING FOR TRAINING ABROAD , INCLUDING IN [LOC JORDAN  ] ------- --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Turning to the [ORG Afghan National Police  ] ( [ORG ANP  ] ) , [PER Atmar  ] sought help from international partners to train a new generation of police leaders ( and noted he planned to raise this issue with [ORG FBI  ] Director [PER Mueller  ] during his upcoming visit in late February ) . 
Since the maximum annual training capacity in [LOC Afghanistan  ] was about 30,000 trainees , and there was a need to train 50,000 per year to meet expansion targets and offset attrition , [PER Atmar  ] expressed that hope that [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC European  ] officials could train 12-15,000 officers per year outside of [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
As the [LOC U.S.  ] had constructed a big facility for police training in [LOC Jordan  ] , which he had heard was under-utilized , he thought it would make a good site for [ORG ANP  ] training and especially for officer candidate training . 
The opportunity to study abroad would boost the appeal for [ORG ANP  ] recruits , while training in safer [LOC Jordan  ] would make it easier for the [MISC Europeans  ] to provide trainers . 
[LOC EUPOL  ] , he noted , had missed its trainer targets for the past two years due to the reluctance of [MISC European  ] police trainers to come to [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Noting that he had sought Ambassador [PER Holbrooke  ] 's help in lining up the [LOC Jordan  ] facility , [PER Atmar  ] expressed hope that the [ORG ANP  ] would hope to obtain rights to use the facility free of charge , with international donors providing meals and incidental expenses to the [MISC Afghan  ] trainees with [ORG NATO  ] transporting the trainees . 
The Minister said he planned to raise this proposal at the [ORG NATO  ] Summit in [LOC Istanbul  ] . 
He said he also hoped the UAE might contribute to paying expenses . 
DEVELOPING THE COUNTERNARCOTICS POLICE -------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Minister [PER Atmar  ] expressed his commitment to strengthening the [ORG Counter-narcotics Police  ] of [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( [ORG CNPA  ] ) , especially in the area of intelligence , adding that he had recently authorized its expansion . 
He said the [ORG CNPA  ] Counter-narcotics Training Academy was one of our best training facilities . 
[PER Atmar  ] characterized the [ORG CNPA  ] as having three tiers: the top end , where vetted units developed by [ORG DEA  ] ( our most trustworthy partner ) and [ORG SOCA  ] were doing a great job ; the eradication force , which [PER Atmar  ] said planned to expand despite the termination of the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Poppy Eradication Force  ] ( [ORG PEF  ] ) program ( We need to keep that force to demonstrate that we are serious ) ; and the [ORG CNPA  ] officers on the ground , responsible for investigating narcotics cases , which faced the greatest challenges , especially in the area of intelligence . 
Ambassador [PER Wayne  ] noted that [ORG DEA  ] and [ORG INL  ] were working with DoD 's Combined [ORG Security Transition Command  ] - [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( [ORG CSTC-A  ] ) on how to build capacity within the [ORG CNPA  ] , including: using some of the personnel from the former [ORG PEF  ] , working with the vetted [ORG National Interdiction Unit  ] ( [ORG NIU  ] ) , and providing more training . 
[PER Atmar  ] welcomed this , commenting that his goal was to obtain enough resources to establish a functioning [ORG CNPA  ] presence in all of [LOC KABUL  ] 00000628 002 OF 002 [LOC Afghanistan  ] 's 365 districts . 
To that end , he had already allocated several hundred more tashkiel ( approved personnel register ) slots to the [ORG CNPA  ] , adding that 95 percent of [ORG CNPA  ] positions were filled . 
Noting that the drug mafia needs to know the police are after them , he observed that while production was concentrated in the [LOC South  ] , trafficking continued to be a problem even in the [LOC North  ] that had largely beat back poppy cultivation . 
REGIONAL RELATIONS - MOVING TO A TASK FORCE BASED APPROACH ------------------ ------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Noting that his next stop would be [LOC Moscow  ] , Director [PER Kerlikowske  ] asked if there were any areas of cooperation he might suggest to the [MISC Russians  ] . 
[PER Atmar  ] responded that [LOC Russia  ] had offered to provide training , and while there was initially some [MISC Afghan  ] resistance , he was prepared to expand that , although I don't want to send everyone to [LOC Moscow  ] . 
He said it is essential to maintain a relationship with [MISC Russian  ] law enforcement to foster regional cooperation on narcotics and weapons trafficking , particularly with the [MISC Central Asian  ] republics . 
Regional cooperation has been unsuccessful over the last eight years because of the inadequacy of institutional arrangements , not because of the lack of political will . 
He expressed the desire to form working level joint task forces with [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC Tajikistan  ] , [LOC Uzbekistan  ] and [LOC Turkmenistan  ] , to look at issues like trade/smuggling , weapons and narcotics. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Minister [PER Atmar  ] also commented on the difficulty of working with the [MISC Iranians  ] and [MISC Pakistanis  ] . 
[LOC Iran  ] 's support for insurgents has made cooperation difficult , and [PER Atmar  ] had encountered resistance from the [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Border Police  ] to working with their [MISC Iranian  ] counterparts because they resent [LOC Iran  ] 's support for insurgents . 
With [LOC Pakistan  ] , [PER Atmar  ] had had limited success in establishing a joint task force , as agreed with [ORG FBI  ] Director [PER Mueller  ] and GOP Minister [PER Malik  ] . 
The key to progress on these issues would be to move them from normal diplomatic channels to police-centered task forces , away from the bureaucracy , he argued . 
[PER Atmar  ] said he would appreciate [LOC U.S.  ] assistance in establishing such an approach ; [PER Kerlikowske  ] pledged to discuss this with Director [PER Mueller  ] in [LOC Washington.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Director [PER Kerlikowske  ] asked whether [ORG Interpol  ] had a role to play in addressing these issues . 
[PER Atmar  ] responded that it should , for example , on drugs , money-laundering , threat finance , and counter-terrorism . 
[ORG DEA  ] had told him that people were smuggling thirty million dollars a week through [LOC Kabul Airport  ] , so [ORG Interpol  ] had a key role in determining where that money was going ( with [MISC Afghan  ] law enforcement entities responsible for identifying where it came from ) . 
Another useful role for [ORG Interpol  ] would be to arrange the deportation of criminals with outstanding arrest warrants who were working against [LOC Afghanistan  ] in [LOC Quetta  ] and [LOC Karachi  ] , he stated. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Atmar  ] and [PER Wayne  ] also discussed recent threat finance enforcement actions , and next steps ( septel ) . <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( SBU ) This message has been cleared by ONDCP Director [PER Kerlikowske  ] .
