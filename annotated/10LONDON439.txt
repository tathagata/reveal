[ORG UK Defends Oil Exploration  ] in [LOC Falkland Islands  ] ------------------------ --------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Tensions mounted between the [LOC United Kingdom  ] and [LOC Argentina  ] ahead of a drilling operation in the [LOC Falkland Islands  ] conservation zones by a [LOC UK  ] company , [ORG Desire Petroleum  ] . 
[LOC Argentina  ] contested the [LOC UK  ] 's right to drill for oil off the coast of the [LOC Falkland Islands  ] , a [ORG British Overseas Territory  ] , and introduced a requirement that vessels traveling to the [MISC Falklands through Argentine  ] waters obtain permits . 
Foreign Secretary [PER David Miliband  ] strongly defended the oil exploration during a February 18 [ORG BBC  ] radio interview , saying it is being conducted in accordance with international law . 
In a statement February 23 , [PER Chris Bryant  ] , the [LOC UK  ] 's [ORG Foreign Office  ] Minister with responsibility for the [ORG British Overseas Territories  ] , reiterated [LOC UK  ] support for the oil exploration . 
He said the [LOC Falkland Islands  ] government is entitled to develop a hydrocarbon industry within its waters . 
He said the [LOC UK  ] will continue to support the islands in developing this " legitimate business in its territory . 
" The [ORG Falkland Islands' Legislative Assembly  ] also asserted its right to develop a hydrocarbon industry within the [MISC Islands'  ] waters in a February 18 press release. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Andrew Allen  ] , Head of the [ORG Southern Oceans  ] , team in [ORG FCO  ] 's [ORG Overseas Territories Directorate  ] , told us February 24 that no [LOC UK  ] government would negotiate the sovereignty of the [MISC Falklands  ] with [LOC Argentina  ] without the approval of the islanders , who overwhelmingly opposed any such discussions . 
He emphasized [ORG HMG  ] desire to continue cooperation with [LOC Argentina  ] on all other issues . 
He said that [LOC Argentina  ] appeared to be taking a similar same stance , noting a [ORG GOA  ] statement that it would proceed in legal , diplomatic ways . 
[PER Allen  ] said the [MISC Argentine  ] Government had so far applied its decree requiring permits for shipping between the mainland and the [MISC Falklands  ] only to one ship and that cruise ships were continuing travel between [MISC Argentine  ] ports and the islands . 
In any event , he said there was little shipping and air traffic between the [MISC Falklands  ] and [LOC Argentina  ] . 
[PER Allen  ] noted that the main supply links to the islands were a weekly flight to [LOC Chile  ] and cargo shipping to and from [LOC Uruguay  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] . 
He expressed some concern that these countries could in the future be tempted to restrict those links out of solidarity with [LOC Argentina.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Desire Petroleum  ] started the new drilling campaign on February 22 . 
Drilling on the " [MISC Liz  ] " well in the [LOC North Falkland Basin  ] is expected to last 30 days . 
An oil rig platform , the [ORG Ocean Guardian  ] , which is owned by [LOC U.S.  ] based [ORG Diamond Drilling  ] , was towed from [LOC Scotland  ] and arrived approximately 62 miles north of the islands in the [MISC South Atlantic  ] on February 19 . 
Desire said the rig is firmly inside [MISC British  ] waters and that [MISC Argentine  ] protestations would not disrupt its activities . 
( [ORG Note: Julia Painting  ] , Head of the [LOC Falkland Islands  ] section within the [ORG FCO  ] 's [ORG Overseas Territories Directorate  ] , said the [LOC Falkland Islands'  ] waters extend 200 nautical miles off the coast of the islands and consist of the [ORG Falkland Interim Conservation Zone of  ] 100 nautical miles ( [ORG FICZ  ] ) and the [ORG Falkland Outer Conservation LONDON  ] 00000439 002.3 OF 003 Zone of 200 nautical miles ( [ORG FOCZ  ] ) . 
There are several " kinks " in the conservation zones where they meet the [ORG Argentinean Exclusive Economic Zone  ] . 
End note . 
) Another official in the same office explained to us that the [ORG FOCZ  ] is the [ORG Falkland 's Exclusive Economic Zone  ] , in all but name . 
Earlier governments had decided to use [ORG FICZ  ] and [ORG FOCZ  ] to avoid arousing tensions over the term . 
The official noted that a drilling rig had operated in the [ORG FOCZ  ] in the late 1990s , provoking no protests from [LOC Argentina  ] . 
According to [ORG FCO  ] , this was a period when then President [PER Menem  ] was seeking cooperation with the [MISC Falklands  ] . 
[LOC Falkland Islands  ] Oil Licensing System ------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Oil exploration and production within the [LOC Falkland  ] 's conservation zones require licenses granted by the [MISC Islands'  ] government . 
Plans to drill must be approved by the Governor of the [LOC Falkland Islands  ] . 
The Governor grants approval having consulted with the [LOC UK  ] 's Foreign Secretary . 
All applications are scrutinized by both the [LOC Falkland Islands  ] and [LOC UK  ] authorities . 
The [ORG Falkland Islands' Department of Mineral Resources  ] advises the [MISC Islands'  ] Governor with regard to local exploration concerns . 
Officials from the [LOC UK  ] 's [ORG Department for Energy and Climate Change  ] ( [ORG DECC  ] ) told us [ORG DECC  ] only offers technical advice to the [LOC UK  ] 's Foreign and [ORG Commonwealth Office  ] ( [ORG FCO  ] ) . 
However , they noted that decisions regarding the development of the [ORG Falkland Islands'  ] hydrocarbon industry are ultimately a matter for the [LOC Falkland Islands  ] government. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) The licensing system consists of exploration licenses and production licenses . 
Exploration licenses allow companies to gather seismic , gravity , magnetic , geochemical , and sea-bed data and do not allow drilling deeper than 350 meters below the sea-bed . 
They are not area-specific and can apply to all of the designated area ) which covers 400,000 kilometers squared , approximately 50 percent bigger than the [LOC UK  ] 's [LOC North Sea  ] . 
Licenses are typically awarded for one year , but can be renewed for up to three years . 
Production licenses are area-specific and provide exclusive rights for surveying , drilling and production . 
They are awarded through occasional competitive rounds or , more typically , under an open-door system . 
Bids for open-door production licenses can be made at any time for any number of whole blocks ( 12' longitude by 10' latitude ) up to a total of 30 continuous blocks in any one license . 
Applicants can determine the size and shape of the area they bid for and there is no limit to the number of licenses that can be applied for at any time. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) The [ORG Falklands'  ] fiscal system comprises a variable acreage rental , 9 percent royalty on production , and 26 percent corporation tax on profits . 
Acreage rentals are payable annually in advance . 
Rents vary depending on the license phase and whether the license was awarded as a result of a competitive licensing round or as the result of an open-door invitation . 
There are no signature bonuses , no production sharing contracts , no back-rights and no local market discounts . 
The [LOC Falkland Islands  ] welcome applications from companies worldwide . 
However , according to the [ORG Department of Mineral Resources  ] , the [LOC Falkland Islands  ] government is unlikely to grant a license to any applicant in which [MISC Argentine  ] interests hold more than a 49 percent stake. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) Existing production license holders are: [ORG Desire Petroleum  ] , [ORG Argos Resources  ] , [ORG Falkland Oil and Gas Ltd/BHP Billiton  ] , [ORG Borders  ] and [ORG Southern Petroleum  ] , and [ORG Rockhopper Exploration  ] . 
Previous operators have included [ORG Shell  ] , [ORG Amerada Hess  ] , [ORG Lasmo  ] and [ORG IPC/Lundin Oil  ] . 
Most of the current license holders are listed on the [ORG London Stock Exchange  ] 's [ORG Alternative Investment Market  ] ( [ORG AIM  ] ) . 
All combined , they have raised in excess of [MISC GBP  ] 250 million in recent months to fund drilling operations . 
[ORG Desire Petroleum  ] ---------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Desire Petroleum  ] , which has started the new drilling campaign , is dedicated to explore for oil and gas in the [LOC North Falkland Basin  ] . 
It was founded in 1996 and is listed on the [ORG London Stock Exchange  ] 's [ORG Alternative Investment Market  ] ( [ORG AIM  ] ) . 
It participated in the first round of drilling in the [LOC North Falkland Basin  ] in 1998 and currently operates six licenses in the area . 
It estimates recoverable oil potential in the region at 3.5 billion barrels , with gas reserves of over 9 trillion cubic feet . 
( [ORG Note: ExxonMobil International  ] Chairman [PER Brad Corson  ] told us he does not [LOC LONDON  ] 00000439 003.3 OF 003 believe there is enough oil on the [LOC Falkland Islands Continental Shelf  ] to be profitable , citing [ORG Shell  ] 's earlier oil exploration attempts which they abandoned . 
End note . 
) <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The current drilling campaign is expected to last approximately eight months , according to [PER Ben Willey  ] , a spokesman for [ORG Desire  ] . 
[PER Willey  ] told us that if all runs smoothly , the [ORG Ocean Guardian  ] rig will drill between six and eight wells . 
The first well , already underway , is for [ORG Desire  ] in the [LOC North Falklands Basin  ] . 
The drilling is expected to last 30 days . 
After this , the rig will start on a second well , also in the [LOC North Basin  ] , for [ORG Rockhopper Exploration  ] . 
The third well will be drilled for the [ORG Falkland Oil and Gas/BHP Billiton  ] joint venture , the fourth for [ORG Rockhopper  ] and the fifth for [ORG Desire  ] . 
Depending on the success of these wells , [ORG Desire  ] may decide to drill up to three additional wells . 
Its contract with [ORG Diamond Drilling  ] , the rig owner , allows for up to eight wells. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Willey  ] stressed that [ORG Desire  ] worked very closely with the [LOC UK  ] 's Foreign and [ORG Commonwealth Office  ] ( [ORG FCO  ] ) over the past five years throughout the planning stages of the drilling campaign . 
During the past few weeks , while tensions with [LOC Argentina  ] have mounted , he said [ORG Desire  ] has sought further advice from the [ORG FCO  ] and cleared all statements with the department to ensure the company does not further inflame the situation . 
[PER Willey  ] said [ORG Desire  ] has also built good relations with the [LOC Falkland Islands  ] government . 
He confirmed that the rig passed entirely through international waters on its journey from [LOC Scotland  ] to the [LOC North Falkland Basin  ] .
