[ORG IBP  ] DISCUSSES [LOC SANTOS BASIN  ] AND SOVEREIGNTY CONCERNS --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On June 6 , Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] met with [ORG IBP  ] President [PER Joco Carlos de Luca  ] and Executive Secretary [PER Alvaro Alves Teixeira  ] . 
They explained that [ORG IBP  ] 's goal is to protect and develop the oil industry in [LOC Brazil  ] , while at the same time supporting and encouraging the free market in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
To that end , they occasionally find themselves at odds with [ORG Petrobras  ] , a majority shareholder in [ORG IBP  ] , as well as [ORG Petrobras  ] 's Exploration and Production ( [ORG E&P  ] ) Director [PER Guilherme de Oliveira Estrella  ] , who happens to be the Chair of [ORG IBP  ] 's board . 
Th eir most recent disagreement has been over continuing application of the concession model to [ORG E&P  ] in the [LOC Santos Basin  ] - which [ORG IBP  ] supports vs. development of a new production sharing model where companies would pay royalties in oil vs. petrodollars ( Ref A ) . 
Royalties are currently at 65 percent , and the GoB is considering a rate hike ( which [ORG ANP  ] supports ) . 
[ORG Petrobras  ] , which controls 90 percent of [ORG E&P  ] in [LOC Brazil  ] is advocating for the production-sharing model . 
[ORG IBP  ] believes that adopting a new model would unnecessarily delay [ORG ANP  ] conducting new oil rounds , since any new model would have to be approved by the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Congress.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The Ambassador expressed interest in building a stronger working partnership with [LOC Brazil  ] to increase world energy security . 
He inquired as to what public resources the [LOC United States  ] could offer to assist [LOC Brazil  ] with oil and gas exploration of the pre-salt areas of the new huge [LOC Santos  ] basin off [LOC Brazil  ] 's coast , an area 800 kilometers long , extend ing from [PER Santa Catarina  ] to [PER Esprito Santo  ] and 200 kilometers wide . 
He also asked about opportunities for [LOC U.S.  ] companies. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG IBP  ] executives highlighted [LOC Brazil  ] 's concerns that the [LOC United States  ] is not a signatory to the [ORG UN  ] convention recognizing the 200 nautical mile economic zone . 
They also expressed concern about the recent announcement of the reestablishment of the [MISC Fourth Fleet  ] headquartered in the [ORG U.S. Southern Command  ] , which occurred at about the same time as the [LOC Santos Basin  ] reserves became public knowledge . 
They explained that the GOB is very sensitive about sovereignty and that the [MISC Fourth Fleet  ] announcement " could not have come at a worse time , " causing a nationalist , protectionist reaction in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
There is concern that the [LOC United States  ] could threaten to use its considerable military assets to commandeer and exploit [LOC Brazil  ] 's offshore assets . 
The [ORG IBP  ] officials felt that an offer to help [LOC Brazil  ] develop a defense system to protect its " blue [MISC Amazon  ] " would furt her build on an already positive relationship that exists between our two Presidents . 
Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] assured the [ORG IBP  ] officials that the [LOC United States  ] does indeed recognize [LOC Brazil  ] 's economic zone as extending 200 miles off [LOC Brazil  ] 's coastline . 
He stated that he would seek guidance on this issue , and raise it with DHS Secretary [PER Chertoff  ] and Defense Minister [PER Nelson Jobim.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
In response to the Ambassador 's inquiry about the commercial viability of extracting oil from the [LOC Santos Basin  ] given the complexity ( and expense ) of drilling in the pre-salt area , the [ORG IBP  ] representatives pointed out that the large potential finds announced in [MISC Tupi  ] ( 5-8 billion barrels of oil equivalent ) and [PER Carioca  ] ( 33 billion barrels of oil equivalent ) represent a small sampling of the oil and gas reserves that may lie in the pre-salt area , which is 2000 to 3000 meters ( 6,000-10,000 feet ) below sea level and could yield more than 80 billion boe - a find that would rival the [LOC North Sea  ] and secure [LOC Brazil  ] 's p lace in the global arena as a major energy RIO DE JAN 00000165 002 OF 002 producer . 
Given [LOC Brazil  ] 's leadership in ultra-deep [ORG E&P  ] technology , it could easily handle depths of that magnitude ; however , exploration in the pre-salt area may strain [LOC Brazil  ] 's exploration capabilities . 
They also noted that while the intellectual capital for [ORG E&P  ] lies with [LOC U.S.  ] companies , [ORG DoE  ] technology would be of considerable value to [LOC Brazil.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The Ambassador offered to explore the idea of a visit by [ORG DoE  ] technical experts to assess what resources [ORG DoE  ] might be able to offer in support of [LOC Brazil  ] 's expressed desire to explore the [LOC Santos Basin  ] , and to prepare for Secretary [PER Bodman  ] 's visit . 
[ORG PETROBRAS  ] PLANS TO BECOME A GLOBAL ENERGY SUPPLIER --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] and [PER Denis Bovin  ] , a member of the President 's [ORG Intelligence Advisory Board  ] , met with [ORG Petrobras'  ] new International Operations Director [PER Jorge Zelada  ] to discuss what role the [ORG USG  ] might pl ay in supporting [ORG Petrobras' E&P  ] and distribution of oil and gas discoveries in the [LOC Santos Basin  ] , and [ORG Petrobras'  ] investment in the [LOC United States  ] . 
[PER Zelada  ] explained that [ORG Petrobras  ] is seeking to strengthen its position as a global energy supplier . 
Its board is currently determining how to best achieve that goal given challenges presented by geology , technological limits and resource restrictions , and should have a revised five-year plan by the end of 2008. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Every year , the [ORG Petrobras  ] board conducts a mid-year assessment . 
This year , the board is reconsidering resource allocations between domestic and international operations for the next five years . 
According to [PER Zelada  ] , the discoveries in the [LOC Santos Basin  ] will affect how and where [ORG Petrobras  ] invests abroad . 
He asserted that [ORG Petrobras  ] will continue to grow as a global energy company , but may have to refocus and refine some of its international activities . 
It is prioritizing [LOC West Africa  ] , the [LOC Gulf  ] of [LOC Mexico  ] , [LOC Nigeria  ] , and Ang ola. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Responding to the Ambassador 's concerns with [ORG Petrobras'  ] activities in the [LOC Iran  ] and the [MISC Caspian  ] , [PER Zelada  ] explained that [ORG Petrobras  ] understood and was sensitive to those concerns . 
He echoed [PER Samir Awad  ] 's assertions ( Ref B ) that [ORG Petrobras  ] was unlikely to renew or seek new contracts in [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Zelada  ] went on to affirm that the [MISC US$5  ] billion [ORG Petrobras  ] has invested in the [LOC United States  ] ( out of [MISC US$15  ] billion internationally ) is likely to increase and will be part of an overall integrated refining strategy . 
( [ORG Note: Petrobras  ] produces mainly heavy crude and must import light crude for refining . 
End Note ) . 
[ORG Petrobras  ] is adapting its refineries to work more with light crude to address a production surplus in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[PER Zelada  ] said that [ORG Petrobras  ] is trying to acquire the other 50 percent of the [LOC Pasadena  ] refinery in [LOC Houston  ] to alleviate refining pressure in [LOC Brazil  ] and referred to the new [LOC Pernambuco  ] refinery , which is a joint venture between [ORG Petrobras  ] and [ORG PDVSA  ] , [LOC Venezuela  ] 's sta te-owned oil company. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Ambassador suggested that when in [LOC Washington  ] , [ORG Petrobras  ] executives meet with Senator [PER Lugar  ] , and that they meet with Secretary [PER Chertoff  ] and Secretary [PER Bodman  ] during their visits to [LOC Brazil  ] . 
The Ambassador also offered to look into the possibility of bringing in [ORG USG  ] resources and technology to complement [ORG Petrobras'  ] efforts . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG Comment:  ] The recent discoveries in the [LOC Santos Basin  ] have created a golden opportunity for the [LOC United States  ] to deepen its strategic relationship with [LOC Brazil  ] 's public and private sector to ensure global energy security . 
To the extent that we can , we should encourage [LOC U.S.  ] resources to support [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG E&P  ] efforts in the [LOC Santos Basin  ] . 
No doubt key officials in the [MISC Brazilian  ] government and [ORG Petrobras  ] board would appreciate the offers of technological support and partnership to allay fears of the [LOC United States  ] not respecting [LOC Brazil  ] 's sovereignty . 
Such a partnership could also offer additional strategic benef its in terms of joint [ORG E&P  ] efforts around the globe . 
Additionally , positive engagement in this dynamic area at the early stages of exploration could reap benefits both in terms of enhancing [LOC U.S.  ] energy security , as well as continuing to improve the bilateral relationship through cooperation in an area of mutual interest .
