( C ) Summary: As we step up engagement with [ORG GIRoA  ] leadership in [LOC Kandahar  ] , it is important to understand the dynamics of political power and how fundamental [LOC Kandahar  ] is to the fortunes of the [PER Karzai  ] regime . 
It is from [LOC Kandahar  ] that President [PER Karzai  ] 's claim to national legitimacy originates and from the province that the [PER Karzai  ] family 's position as a semi-modern aristocracy stems . 
As the kingpin of [LOC Kandahar  ] , the President 's younger half-brother [PER Ahmed Wali Karzai  ] ( [ORG AWK  ] ) dominates access to economic resources , patronage , and protection . 
Much of the real business of running [LOC Kandahar  ] takes place out of public sight , where [ORG AWK  ] operates , parallel to formal government structures , through a network of political clans that use state institutions to protect and enable licit and illicit enterprises . 
A dramatic example is the [LOC Arghandab  ] river valley , an agriculturally rich and heavily-populated district strategically located at the northern gate to [LOC Kandahar City  ] , where the President 's direct intervention in the [MISC Alikozai  ] tribal succession increased [PER Karzai  ] political dominance over two of the most valuable resources in [LOC Kandahar  ] -- fertile land and water . 
The tribal power structure in [LOC Kandahar  ] seriously complicates our efforts to bring formal justice and modern governance to the region . 
In the absence of [ORG GIRoA  ] initiatives to bring key individuals closely linked to the [PER Karzai  ] regime to justice , RC [LOC South  ] is pursuing a bottom-up approach to the [LOC Arghandab  ] shura . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) As we step up engagement with [ORG GIRoA  ] leadership in [LOC Kandahar  ] in pursuit of [LOC U.S.  ] security , stabilization , development and anti-corruption goals , it is important to understand the dynamics of political power and how fundamental [LOC Kandahar  ] is to the fortunes of the [PER Karzai  ] regime ( Ref A ) . 
It is from [LOC Kandahar  ] , not [LOC Kabul  ] , that President [PER Karzai  ] 's claim to national legitimacy originates , and where , through leadership of the royal [PER Durrani Popalzai  ] tribe , he has a true political base . 
In [LOC Kandahar  ] , political clans consisting of personal , tribal , marriage and economic alliances engage in balance of power competition and cooperation . 
At the pinnacle of [LOC Kandahar  ] 's political clans , the [PER Karzai  ] clan functions as a semi-modern aristocracy , with the President ultimately presiding over the nation. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) As the kingpin of [LOC Kandahar  ] , the President 's younger half-brother , [PER Ahmed Wali Karzai  ] , rules over political deal and decision-making at the provincial level and thereby dominates access to economic resources , patronage and protection . 
The overriding purpose that unifies his political roles as Chairman of the [ORG Kandahar Provincial Council  ] and as the President 's personal representative to the South is the enrichment , extension and perpetuation of the [PER Karzai  ] clan , and along with it their branch of the [PER Popalzai  ] tribe . 
This applies equally to his entrepreneurial and his alleged criminal activities . 
[ORG AWK  ] derives authority and legitimacy from his relationship to President [PER Karzai  ] , from the relative discipline and elite position of the [PER Popalzai  ] tribe and from his access to resources . 
In [LOC Kandahar  ] 's political realm , he is an unrivaled strongman . 
For example , the [ORG Kandahar Provincial Council  ] , which is made up largely of individuals who are personally beholden to him , wields serious influence , despite its lack of statutory powers . 
It is currently going about its business unhindered despite the fraud charges that have prevented the [ORG IEC  ] from certifying the recent [ORG Provincial Council  ] election results ( Ref B ) . xxxxxxxxxxxx <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Much of the real business of running [LOC Kandahar  ] takes place out of public sight , where [ORG AWK  ] operates parallel to formal government structures through a network of political clans that use state institutions to protect and enable licit and illicit enterprises . 
At its core , this clan network has a caste-like division of labor . 
The [PER Popalzai  ] occupy the leadership pinnacle . 
The [ORG Barakzai  ] , with [PER Gul Agha Sherzai  ] as their leader , compete for power and business , which includes , for example , contracting at [LOC Kandahar Air Field  ] and transport on Highway 4 from the [LOC Pakistan  ] border at [LOC Spin Boldak  ] . 
The [MISC Noorzai  ] occupy key positions in the [LOC ANSF  ] and are the traditional racketeers ( with ties to narcotics trafficking ) . 
The [MISC Achekzais  ] along the border are the traditional smugglers , and the [MISC Alikozai  ] are the traditional [LOC Kabul  ] 00003890 002 of 003 warriors. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Among [PER Karzai  ] family-run businesses are alleged control of trucking on Highway 1 ( the [LOC Ring Road  ] ) through [ORG Kandahar Province  ] and beyond , private security contracting and real estate . 
The last notably includes [PER Ayno Mina  ] , an ostentatious [PER Karzai  ] property development for [MISC Afghan  ] elites east of [LOC Kandahar City  ] , built on land obtained from the government at rock bottom prices , with financing guaranteed by [ORG OPIC  ] . 
In a land of popular strongmen , [ORG AWK  ] is widely unpopular in [LOC Kandahar  ] , because he rules exclusively rather than inclusively ; he is not perceived as caring about the population at large but rather , as a traditional [PER Pashtuns Khan  ] using his power to " feed his tribe . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) A good example of how the [MISC Karzais'  ] power plays out in [LOC Kandahar  ] can be found in the [LOC Arghandab  ] river valley , an agriculturally rich and heavily populated district strategically located at the northern gate to [LOC Kandahar City  ] , where the [MISC Alikozai  ] tribe makes up 60 percent of the population . 
They received the valley as a reward for assisting the founder of [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Ahmed Shah Durrani  ] , conquer [LOC Kandahar  ] in the mid-1700s . 
As the guardians of [LOC Kandahar  ] , the [MISC Alikozais  ] have prevented all invaders from occupying [LOC Arghandab  ] . 
The [MISC Soviets  ] fought hard but never took it and as a result were never secure in [LOC Kandahar City  ] . 
The [ORG Taliban  ] 's rise to power began in [LOC Kandahar  ] , when the powerful [MISC Alikozai  ] leader [PER Mullah Naquibullah  ] decided to give them the keys to the city , and he turned on them to assist their overthrow in 2001 . 
When [PER Mullah Naqib  ] died of a heart attack in 2007 , President [PER Karzai  ] took the unusual step of flying to [LOC Kandahar  ] , where he anointed [PER Naquib  ] 's son [PER Karimullah  ] as the new leader of the [MISC Alikozai  ] . 
However , the move had significant blowback . 
[PER Mullah Naqib  ] had never designated his young and inexperienced son as his successor , and [PER Karzai  ] 's intervention generated resentment among senior [MISC Alikozai  ] elders . 
The resulting split weakened tribal unity , a vulnerability the [ORG Taliban  ] quickly exploited , and it remains a present source of instability. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [LOC Arghandab  ] story appears on the surface to be a case of bungled tribal exploitation . 
On the contrary , by intervening in the [MISC Alikozai  ] succession , the [ORG Karzais  ] linked the most important tribal faction to control over the provincial government in a line that runs from [ORG AWK  ] to their putative leader [PER Karimullah  ] , who in turn holds sway over the District Administrator and local shura . 
The [ORG Karzais  ] also increased their influence over two of the most valuable resources in [LOC Kandahar  ] ( which is largely desert ) -- fertile land and water . 
The [LOC Arghandab  ] river valley , contains some of the best agricultural land in [LOC Afghanistan  ] ; it famously produces 80 percent of the country 's pomegranates . 
Production and land values there will increase greatly as a result of [LOC Canada  ] 's " signature " rehabilitation of the [ORG Dahla Dam  ] and irrigation works , originally constructed by the [LOC U.S.  ] in the 1950s . 
[PER Karzai  ] businesses are also set to acquire multiple patronage benefits from [ORG Dahla Dam  ] construction and security contracts , but the main prize will be political control over long-term allocation of water flows , including to [PER Popalzai  ] and [ORG Barakzai  ] areas that lie well downstream , via underground canals to the south. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) It is no accident that [ORG AWK  ] lobbied the project 's [MISC Canadian  ] sponsors on behalf of the [ORG Watan Group  ] , the eventual winner of the [ORG Dahla Dam  ] security contract , whose CEO is his cousin , [LOC U.S.  ] national [PER Rashid Popal  ] . 
More than business is involved ; most of the project lies in [MISC Alikozai  ] majority areas , but the [MISC Popalzai  ] will control security , and [MISC Alikozai  ] leader [PER Karimullah  ] was incensed over this treatment by his [PER Karzai  ] sponsors when he found out . 
A follow-on to warlord militias , private security companies today also serve personal interests as camouflaged vehicles for protection rackets in construction , transportation and drug smuggling . 
[ORG AWK  ] 's determined but so far unsuccessful efforts to acquire MOI-sanction to license all contractors and their weapons through the [ORG Provincial Council  ] has the potential to arm the [PER Karzai  ] clan with a non-state entity that can insure against whoever should come to power in [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Comment: The traditional tribal power structures in [LOC Kandahar  ] have many implications for [LOC U.S.  ] objectives in the region . 
Initiatives that rely on [ORG GIRoA  ] to take the lead in bringing to justice major corrupt figures or negative influences in [LOC Kandahar  ] contain a serious dilemma: they would include some of [PER Karzai  ] , s closest relatives and allies and require the prosecution of people on whom we often rely for assistance and/or support . 
Second , any efforts to bring these individuals to justice could compromise the informal [LOC Kabul  ] 00003890 003 of 003 governing networks to which Kandaharis have become accustomed , without necessarily replacing them with effective [ORG GIRoA  ] officials or improving the delivery of services . 
A focus on bottom-up local solutions , such as identifying and reaching out to the multiple factions in [LOC Arghandab  ] as well as the official shura , which RC [MISC South  ] is pursuing , could offset this problem to some degree . 
End Comment. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) This assessment , derived from multiple sources including information provided by over a dozen knowledgeable [MISC Afghans  ] , presents a perspective that is widely perceived among the [MISC Afghan  ] public and consistent with documentation in open sources and intelligence analyses .
