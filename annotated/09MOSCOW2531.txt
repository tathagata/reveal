( C ) SUMMARY: Despite [MISC Russian  ] President [PER Medvedev  ] 's September 24 remarks that sanctions against [LOC Iran  ] might be necessary , other government officials and experts here caution that [LOC Russia  ] will remain , for the time being , reluctant to pursue a tougher line against [LOC Tehran  ] . 
The consensus among the [MISC Russian  ] political elite is that maintaining a dialogue with the [MISC Iranians  ] and exhausting diplomatic avenues is preferable to imposing sanctions in the near term . 
While [PER Medvedev  ] as president is responsible for controlling arms and nuclear technology transfers , Prime Minister [PER Putin  ] remains closely identified with decisions on [LOC Iran  ] policy , including the sale of civilian nuclear technology and weapons , which provides a boost to powerful state enterprises . 
According to Deputy [PER FM Ryabkov  ] , [PER Putin  ] 's relative silence on [LOC Iran  ] since [PER Medvedev  ] 's statements does not signal any difference between them on sanctions . 
End Summary . 
[PER Medvedev  ] on [ORG Sanctions: Few Official Echoes  ] ------------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [MISC Russian  ] Government officials , including Prime Minister [PER Putin  ] , have not yet echoed President [PER Medvedev  ] 's public statement that [LOC Russia  ] would consider the imposition of sanctions on [LOC Iran  ] if the world community ran out of other options . 
Asked about [MISC Russian  ] views on the [LOC Qom  ] revelation in [LOC New York  ] September 25 , [PER FM Lavrov  ] adopted a strikingly softer tone than in the just released [LOC Kremlin  ] statement . 
He noted that [LOC Iran  ] had acted positively by notifying the [ORG IAEA  ] about its plans to construct a new nuclear facility , and complained that some of [LOC Russia  ] 's " partner countries " in the [LOC P5-plus-1  ] had not shared information about the [LOC Qom  ] facility earlier . 
[PER Lavrov  ] stressed that [LOC Iran  ] 's cooperation with the world community as a member of the NPT with non-nuclear status could prove the peaceful nature of its nuclear program. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Before the most recent [LOC P5-plus-1  ] meeting in [LOC Geneva  ] , PM [PER Putin  ] said that [LOC Russia  ] would not support " significant " changes to its approach on [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Ariel Cohen  ] , a senior fellow at the [ORG Heritage Foundation  ] , said [PER Putin  ] and [PER Lavrov  ] told him in early September that they are opposed to tougher sanctions and the use of force against [LOC Iran  ] . 
[MISC Russian  ] Deputy Foreign Minster [PER Sergei Ryabkov  ] said September 29 that [LOC Iran  ] 's recent proposals presented a " broad field for dialogue . 
" [PER Ryabkov  ] added that whether sanctions against [LOC Iran  ] might become inevitable was a " completely separate issue , one that we are not yet ready to address . 
" He stressed [LOC Russia  ] 's position was to do everything possible to find a " diplomatic , political solution to the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear problem . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While expressing concern over [LOC Iran  ] 's missile program , [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador to [ORG NATO  ] [PER Dmitriy Rogozin  ] stressed September 29 that [LOC Russia  ] preferred political dialogue over tough measures that could trigger an " arms race in the region . 
" [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador to the [LOC United States  ] [PER Sergey Kislyak  ] said September 24 that sanctions were not the way to resolve the problem ; rather , the point was how to find a " political solution that would eliminate this problem . 
" The priority was to " start a serious dialogue with our [MISC Iranian  ] partners in seeking a way out of the situation . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [LOC Russia  ] 's message to domestic audiences also remains unchanged . 
Despite [PER Medvedev  ] 's carefully worded comments on sanctions in [LOC New York  ] ( called by one analyst here " a jewel of diplomatic casuistry " ) , even prominent [MISC Russians  ] with ties to the [LOC Kremlin  ] 's domestic propaganda machine believe [MISC Russian  ] support for [MISC Western  ] sanctions is highly unlikely . 
[PER Medvedev  ] advisor [PER Gleb Pavlovskiy  ] , President of the [ORG Effective Policy Foundation  ] , and [PER Maksim Shevchenko  ] , President of the [ORG Russian World Foundation  ] , even spoke in favor of completing [LOC Russia  ] 's frozen [MISC S-300  ] surface-to-air missile deal with [LOC Iran  ] . 
Interpreting [PER Putin  ] 's Silence ---------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) PM [PER Putin  ] 's lack of public comment on the possibility of [LOC Iran  ] sanctions after President [PER Medvedev  ] 's public statement does not indicate disagreement between them on [LOC Iran  ] , [PER DFM Ryabkov  ] told Ambassador [PER Beyrle  ] October 3 . 
[PER Ryabkov  ] repeated his comments , made in [LOC Geneva  ] during [LOC P5-plus-1  ] talks , that [LOC Russia  ] had not ruled out the possibility of sanctions , but would begin to contemplate them only as an absolute last resort. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Most political commentators and analysts here have been echoing the same statements . 
[PER Tatyana Stanovaya  ] of the [ORG Center for Political Technologies  ] thought that [PER Medvedev  ] 's seemingly more positive statement indicates no real rapprochement with the [LOC U.S.  ] on [LOC Iran  ] . 
Rather , she said , his words are carefully calibrated to indicate a welcoming of [LOC U.S.  ] willingness to use the [LOC P5-plus-1  ] format and engage in actual discussions with [MISC Iranian  ] officials. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Nevertheless , [PER Medvedev  ] 's [LOC New York  ] comments and the September 25 [LOC Kremlin  ] statement mark a definite toughening of [MISC Russian  ] rhetoric on [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Pravoe Delo  ] co-Chairman [PER Georgiy Bovt  ] told us October 5 that [PER Medvedev  ] 's use of the word " sanctions " represents a policy change . 
[PER Boyt  ] cautioned that [PER Medvedev  ] 's words would probably resonate with only a distinct minority of [MISC Russian  ] society . 
He believes it will be hard for [PER Medvedev  ] to sell [LOC Iran  ] sanctions to the [MISC Russian  ] bureaucracy without the full support of [PER Putin  ] . 
At the [ORG Sochi Economic Forum  ] , [PER Putin  ] blasted the [LOC U.S.  ] for not allowing the export of certain high technology to [LOC Russia  ] . 
[PER Boyt  ] thinks [LOC Russia  ] might ask for an easing of these restrictions in exchange for supporting sanctions . 
[ORG Sanctions: Economic Implications  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Despite [PER Medvedev  ] 's presidential authority over arms transfers , [PER Putin  ] undoubtedly retains a critical , if not decisive role over an issue with such significant domestic economic implications as the transfer of nuclear technology and armaments to [LOC Iran  ] . 
[LOC Russia  ] and [LOC Iran  ] currently have limited military cooperation , so the effect of any lost revenue from arms sales to [LOC Iran  ] would be small . 
While the sale of [LOC S-300s  ] to [LOC Iran  ] , for example , would only net [LOC Russia  ] from [MISC USD  ] 750 million to [MISC USD  ] one billion , future military sales could be considerably larger. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Several years ago [LOC Iran  ] was a stable source of hard currency and this cash flow helped [LOC Russia  ] preserve its nuclear construction sector . 
The importance of [LOC Russia  ] 's trade with [LOC Iran  ] has decreased , but [MISC Russian  ] exports to [LOC Iran  ] last year still exceeded [MISC USD  ] 3 billion . 
In the currently depressed [MISC Russian  ] economy , that is not an insignificant amount . 
In addition , great potential for future economic gain to [LOC Russia  ] exists via civilian nuclear technology sales and increased military cooperation. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) As the world 's largest exporter of oil and gas , [LOC Russia  ] also benefits significantly from the " instability premium " embedded in world oil prices due to tensions with [LOC Iran  ] . 
Even a [MISC USD  ] 5 per barrel instability premium would net [LOC Russia  ] almost [MISC USD  ] 9 billion per year for oil and approximately [MISC USD  ] 2-4 billion from its gas exports . 
Finally , given [LOC Iran  ] 's position as the second largest owner of gas reserves , [LOC Russia  ] 's gas sector clearly benefits from the lack of international investment in the development of [LOC Iran  ] 's natural gas sector . 
Life without [LOC Iran  ] ----------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [LOC Russia  ] could profit from alternatives to its continued support for [LOC Iran  ] . 
For example , news reports indicate that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] has offered to purchase the [MISC Russian  ] S-400 system for [MISC USD  ] two billion in an effort to force [LOC Moscow  ] to back out of the [MISC S-300  ] deal with [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Medvedev  ] cited [ORG Arab League  ] concerns about [LOC Russia  ] 's close relationship with [LOC Iran  ] when he stated that [LOC Russia  ] 's stance on [LOC Iran  ] might be changing. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [LOC Israel  ] also is clearly pushing [LOC Russia  ] to take a firmer stance towards [LOC Tehran  ] , in light of recent press reports that PM Netanyahu personally delivered a list of [MISC Russian  ] scientists who contributed to [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program . 
Conversations with [MISC Israeli  ] diplomats in [LOC Moscow  ] indicate that [LOC Israel  ] believes there may be even more to [LOC Iran  ] 's program than is now known to the [ORG GOR  ] and [MISC Russian  ] decision makers . 
They hint that [MISC Israeli  ] disclosures on [MISC Russian  ] participation could force [LOC Moscow  ] into taking a harder line . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Success in moving [LOC Russia  ] to support tougher actions against [LOC Iran  ] will require a coordinated strategy involving our friends and allies , including [LOC Israel  ] and [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
The strategy may need to include the continuation of diplomatic efforts like the [LOC P5-plus-1  ] process and perhaps include new ways of engaging in dialogue with [LOC Iran  ] . 
A strategy created by a broad international consensus must offer [LOC Moscow  ] a series of options that will challenge the stubborn mentality here that instinctively opposes common cause with the [LOC West  ] on [LOC Iran  ] . 
Sanctions would have a major impact on the [MISC Russian  ] economy , and especially to the domestic constituencies like [ORG RosOboronexport  ] and [ORG RosAtom  ] . 
The fact that the economy and these key state-controlled enterprises are part of [PER Putin  ] 's portfolio only reinforces the certainty that he will remain the key decision maker on any imposition of sanctions . 
Key to the [ORG GOR  ] 's calculations would be any politically salable alternatives that benefit them both economically and politically .
