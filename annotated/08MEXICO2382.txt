End Summary . 
THE [ORG CIVIL SOCIETY PERSPECTIVE  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) On 28 July , Deputy Director of the [MISC Fundacion Infantia  ] ( the Children 's Foundation ) [PER Javier Martinez  ] , Regional Director of the Coalition to Against Trafficking of Women and Children in [LOC Latin America  ] and the [ORG Caribbean  ] [PER Teresa Ulloa  ] and [PER Pilar Vallejo  ] of the [ORG National Network of Women  ] in [LOC Mexico City  ] dialogued and exchanged ideas with the Director of the [ORG Office of International Women  ] 's Issues ( IWI ) and her accompanying delegation . 
[PER Martinez  ] , [PER Ulloa  ] and [PER Vallejo  ] commented that women 's [ORG NGOs  ] in [LOC Mexico  ] were severely under-funded , often stretching budgets suitable for only five or six months of expenses to cover annual operational costs . 
In general , gender-based violence does not receive sufficient attention from federal and state officials , according to [PER Ulloa  ] . 
Existing legislation , she criticized , is vague and places the burden to prove gender-based violence on the victim . 
[PER Ulloa  ] also said societal ills such as poverty and organized crime fueled gender-based violence throughout [LOC Mexico  ] . 
An estimated 60 percent of [MISC Mexican  ] women have experienced some form of gender-based violence. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Despite tremendous financial constraints , women 's [ORG NGOs  ] have been vigilant and creative in their efforts to assist victims . 
[MISC Fundacion Infantia  ] has established partnerships with local hotels like the [ORG Sheraton  ] and [PER JW Marriot  ] in [LOC Mexico City  ] , [LOC Cancun  ] and [LOC Puerto Vallarta  ] to train women ages 18-21 in hospitality and tourism . 
[PER Vallejo  ] mentioned that the [ORG National Network of Women  ] plans to establish specialized shelters within indigenous communities and to lobby for stronger legislation to safeguard the human rights of all [MISC Mexican  ] women and girls . 
[PER Bottner  ] commended the efforts of both organization , particularly [MISC Fundacion Infantia  ] 's efforts to move women from the role of victims to professionals . 
FEVIMTRA'S ROLE IN DETERRING GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) Generally , cases of gender-based violence fall under the state , s jurisdiction . 
For these cases to reach the [ORG Office of the Special Prosecutor for Violence Against Women  ] and Trafficking in [MISC Persons  ] ( [ORG FEVIMTRA  ] ) , they must either involve a federal official or there must be proof that the crime occurred using federal transportation , on the federal highway system , or in a federal building . 
However , if these cases are linked to a larger organized crime network , the [ORG Organized Crime Division  ] ( [ORG SIEDO  ] ) of the Attorney General 's [ORG Office  ] ( [ORG PGR  ] ) invokes jurisdiction . 
[ORG FEVIMTRA  ] officials said internal disagreements regarding jurisdiction severely restricted their ability to intervene in cases involving violence against women and trafficking in persons . 
[ORG FEVIMTRA  ] has no power to investigate state cases of domestic violence but officials can assist state officials in conducting investigations . 
[ORG FEVIMTRA  ] officials say they are advocating new legislation that would allow federal jurisdiction to supersede state jurisdiction in domestic violence cases. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Last fiscal year , the [MISC Mexican  ] [ORG Congress  ] appropriated [ORG MXP  ] 70 million ( approximately USD 7 million ) for [ORG FEVIMTRA  ] to build shelters for domestic violence and trafficking victims . 
[PER Edith Carbajal  ] , Deputy Coordinator of [ORG FEVIMTRA  ] 's [ORG Office of Victim 's Assistance  ] , said there were no existing shelters but that her office was finalizing the purchase of a building with the capacity to house 60 victims . 
In addition to offering shelter and psychological treatment , the facility would also offer individual and group therapy , artistic [LOC MEXICO  ] 00002382 002.2 OF 003 training and a physical fitness program . 
[PER Sue Else  ] , Head of the [ORG National Network  ] to End Violence Against Women in [LOC Missouri  ] , asked if protection order were available through the [MISC Mexican  ] courts to shield victims from their aggressors . 
[ORG FEVIMTRA  ] officials commented that the General Law to Guarantee the Right of Women to a Life Free of Violence authorized protection orders. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) [ORG FEVIMTRA  ] officials estimate at least half of the country 's [ORG PGR  ] officials have completed a mandatory certification program covering gender violence and trafficking in persons . 
The certification program is conducted through a partnership with the [ORG National Autonomous University  ] and is expected to extend its partnership to [ORG Iberoamerican University  ] and the [ORG University of Guadalajara  ] in the near future . 
In addition to [ORG PGR  ] officials , Federal police , state level prosecutors and legal experts are also certified through the [ORG PGR  ] 's program . 
Although a few state police officials have taken the course , it is not obligatory . 
[ORG FEVIMTRA  ] officials mentioned they were lobbying state authorities to make their certification program a mandatory part of law enforcement training . 
Independently of the [ORG PGR  ] , The Coalition to Prevent Trafficking of [LOC Women  ] in [LOC Latin America  ] and the [ORG Caribbean  ] currently trains state police officials through its partnership with [LOC Mexico  ] 's 23 [MISC Jesuit  ] universities , which includes [ORG Iberoamerican University  ] . 
THE STRUCTURE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHELTERS ------------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) Like their civil society counterparts , shelter directors complain that their capacity to assist victims of domestic violence is constrained by financial factors . 
Because of budgetary limitations , it is often difficult for shelter administrators to keep up with the demand for assistance and at times , victims are turned away . 
On average , a female victim comes to a shelter with three or four children . 
Shelter rules are outlined by the facility 's director , and the victim 's personal effects are searched for hazardous items . 
In the shelter visited by [PER Bottner  ] and her delegation , program participants are not permitted to leave the facility for the first 45 days ; not even to maintain employment . 
After the 45 day risk assessment period has concluded , shelter administrators determine if it is safe for the victim and her children to venture outside of the compound 's walls . 
If it is determined that the victim 's life or that of her dependents are in danger , the risk assessment period is extended , the victim is restricted to the shelter and her minor children are educated inside of the facility. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) Both private and government-funded shelters nationally do not release information regarding their locations . 
Director of the [ORG National Network of Domestic Violence Shelters  ] in [LOC Mexico City  ] [PER Margarita Guille  ] and local shelter director [PER Conchita Martinez  ] disagreed about whether or not police authorities were familiar with the locations of these facilities . 
In [LOC Mexico City  ] , municipal police officers are generally knowledgeable of the location of domestic violence shelters but in other states , these locations are retain their anonymity , according to [PER Martinez  ] . 
[PER Guille  ] countered that police throughout [LOC Mexico  ] typically knew where domestic violence shelters were located . 
She also mentioned that when information regarding the whereabouts of a victim is leaked to a spouse or boyfriend , the [ORG National Shelter Network  ] works quickly to relocate the individual and her children out of harms way [ORG INMUJER  ] ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) The [ORG National Institute for Women  ] ( [ORG INMUJER  ] ) holds a cabinet-level advisory role within the [ORG Calderon Administration  ] and receives its funding directly from the [MISC Mexican  ] government . 
Officials at [ORG INMUJER  ] explained that each year the organization solicits projects from civil society organization that promote women 's issues . 
On average , financial assistance grants range from USD 3k to USD 30k , but [ORG INMUJER  ] officials say the awarded grants are generally closer to the $30k maximum . 
In an effort to ensure equal funding opportunities for all women 's [ORG NGOs  ] , organizations funded during any fiscal year must wait for two years before submitting another proposal for funding consideration . 
[ORG INMUJER  ] not only works closely with women 's [ORG NGOs  ] in [LOC Mexico  ] but throughout [LOC Latin America  ] to promote gender equality and victim 's assistance programs. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) COMMENT: The root causes of gender-based violence in [LOC Mexico  ] city run deep , so deep that it is impossible to [LOC MEXICO  ] 00002382 003.4 OF 003 discuss the issue of violence against women without considering the effects of poverty , cultural mores , or increased national insecurity and instability . 
Not only do these factors fuel violence against and exploitation of women and girls but also a host of other societal problems , including human trafficking . 
Although officials appear genuinely interested in protecting the human rights of [MISC Mexican  ] women , the [ORG GOM  ] 's war against the drug cartels and organized crime elements have forced civil society concerns to take a back-seat to more pressing national security issues . 
Both the [ORG GOM  ] and civil society 's efforts to combat gender-based violence are commendable but without a more coordinated effort to eradicate domestic violence at the national level , it will be difficult for even the best efforts to keep up with increasing demands for victim assistance .
