( C ) Summary: One day after his June 27 arrival in [LOC Spain  ] , US Ambassador [PER Eduardo Aguirre  ] met with Foreign Minister [PER Moratinos  ] to lay the groundwork for a new relationship after a year of difficult relations with the Socialist government , but also to make clear [LOC US  ] concerns about [MISC Spanish  ] policy toward [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] and the lingering wounds in [LOC Washington  ] over the [ORG Zapatero  ] government 's harsh rhetoric on [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC US  ] electoral politics last year . 
Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] urged [PER Moratinos  ] to undertake high level public statements to educate the [MISC Spanish  ] public about the government 's support for and active role in [LOC Iraq  ] reconstruction and democratization , despite the withdrawal of [MISC Spanish  ] troops . 
[PER Moratinos  ] took note of this suggestion , underscoring [MISC Spanish  ] financial support for [LOC Iraq  ] reconstruction , training of [MISC Iraqi  ] security forces and assistance in judicial training . 
[PER Moratinos  ] told [PER Aguirre  ] he wants to work closely with him to avoid misperceptions and misunderstandings between the two countries . 
END SUMMARY <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] thanked [PER Moratinos  ] for the warm welcome he had received already from the [MISC Spanish  ] government , and for the speed in which the [MISC Spanish  ] government has enabled him to get started . 
Copies of his letters of credence were accepted upon arrival , enabling his meeting with [PER Moratinos  ] to focus on substance rather than courtesies . 
The King had agreed to include him in a June 29 Ambassadorial credentials ceremony at the [LOC Royal Palace  ] , which opens the door for an early meeting with President [ORG Zapatero  ] . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] told [PER Moratinos  ] that this quick start fit with his personal style and his desire to be active as the face and the voice of [MISC US-Spain  ] relations . 
Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] underscored to [PER Moratinos  ] he plans to engage the [MISC Spanish  ] public and press as well as the government to convey [LOC US  ] views and explain [LOC US  ] policies . 
He said President [PER Bush  ] , [ORG NSC Advisor Hadley  ] and Secretary Rice want him to turn a new , fresh page in the [ORG SIPDIS  ] relationship , with the Ambassador as the face and voice of the [ORG Administration  ] . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] invited [PER Moratinos  ] to join him as a partner in this endeavor. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Moratinos  ] welcomed the [ORG Ambassador  ] 's active approach and said that the [MISC Spanish  ] government had wanted to ensure a rapid start to his tenure in [LOC Madrid  ] . 
King [PER Juan Carlos  ] personally decided to include the [ORG Ambassador  ] in the already-scheduled June 29 credentials ceremony for several other Ambassadors , even though these ceremonies usually take place at least a month or more after an Ambassador 's arrival in country. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] , s arrival , [PER Moratinos  ] said , provides an opportunity to clear up misperceptions about the [ORG Zapatero  ] government 's policies and intentions , which had taken root after the [MISC Spanish  ] troop withdrawal and during the [LOC US  ] electoral campaign . 
[PER Moratinos  ] wants the [LOC US  ] to understand that the [ORG Zapatero  ] government seeks to create an atmosphere with the [ORG US of  ] friendship and collegiality , and would like [LOC Washington  ] to understand that his government is not anti-American nor ideological in its approach . 
While lines of communication were good , particularly after the series of high level meetings such as [PER Moratinos  ] with Secretary Rice and Defense Minister [PER Bono  ] with Secretary [PER Rumsfeld  ] , [PER Moratinos  ] hoped the arrival of a new [LOC US  ] Ambassador offered the opportunity to develop a close dialogue and full cooperation with the [ORG Bush Administration  ] . 
[PER Moratinos  ] said he had responded to a [MISC Spanish  ] TV reporter 's question June 27 about whether Presidents [ORG Bush  ] and [ORG Zapatero  ] would meet by saying that he had offered a broad time frame for a possible meeting within the tenure of the current [MISC Spanish  ] legislature ( which has at least 3 more years to go ) . 
[PER Moratinos  ] said he hoped that relations by then would have improved to such an extent that such a meeting could be possible. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) On [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] , [PER Moratinos  ] worried that our policy differences had contributed to misperceptions between [LOC Washington  ] and [LOC Madrid  ] . 
He told the Ambassador that [LOC Spain  ] shared [LOC U.S.  ] objectives aimed its policies toward results and deeds . 
He urged cooperation between [LOC Spain  ] and the [LOC US  ] on these and other [MISC Latin America  ] issues , which would have a significant force-multiplying effect . 
On the positive side , [PER Moratinos  ] pointed to [LOC Spain  ] 's full support and leadership role in [LOC Afghanistan  ] as a major positive element in our relationship . 
As an example , [PER Moratinos  ] noted Defense Minister [PER Bono  ] 's appearance in the [MISC Spanish  ] Parliament June 22 to announce additional troop deployments to support legislative elections there. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] said his focus would be on tangible results in the relationship and would not measure success by high-level visits ( which he also stressed to the [MISC Spanish  ] press after the meeting ) . 
The Ambassador urged [PER Moratinos  ] to work with him to turn our difficulties over [LOC Cuba  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] into a net positive in our relationship , by remaining on the same page and avoiding steps that legitimize and encourage [PER Chavez  ] and [PER Castro.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) On [LOC Iraq  ] , the Ambassador told [PER Moratinos  ] that while the [LOC US  ] had put the troop withdrawal issue behind us , there remained considerable lingering concern and irritation over the [ORG Zapatero  ] government 's rhetoric in the months following the withdrawal and during the [LOC US  ] electoral campaign . 
This irritation will not easily dissipate but could be ameliorated , the Ambassador suggested , by new , positive public rhetoric by [ORG Zapatero  ] and his team emphasizing that [LOC Spain  ] recognizes progress made in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
New [MISC Spanish  ] rhetoric could note that [LOC Spain  ] , along with the [LOC United States  ] is now focused on the here and now and the future of [LOC Iraq  ] , including reconstruction , democratization and capacity-building for [MISC Iraqi  ] security forces . 
Such statements , aimed at educating the [MISC Spanish  ] public about current goals and objectives in [LOC Iraq  ] rather than dwelling on the past , would be noticed and welcomed in [LOC Washington  ] . 
[PER Moratinos  ] said he would " take good note " of this advice , underscoring [LOC Spain  ] 's active role in providing financial support for reconstruction and development , training [MISC Iraqi  ] security forces and judicial and related training. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] pointed to the [LOC Middle East  ] and [LOC North Africa  ] as areas in which the [LOC US  ] and [LOC Spain  ] shared common objectives and as ripe for opportunities to work together . 
[PER Moratinos  ] agreed , welcoming Secretary Rice 's activism in the region . 
It would be very useful , [PER Moratinos  ] said , if all of the players in [LOC Washington  ] , the [ORG EU  ] and its members , the Quartet , could unify their messages both to [LOC Israel  ] and the [MISC Palestinians  ] . 
In [LOC North Africa  ] , [PER Moratinos  ] said that competition among the players does not have to be the norm and that there is space for all , including in the area of commercial interests such as in oil and natural gas . 
He urged the development of a common strategic vision in this region. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) In a one-on-one session after the meeting , [PER Moratinos  ] again underscored to the Ambassador his government 's desire to avoid misunderstandings with the [LOC United States  ] and to open a new chapter in the relationship . 
The Ambassador said that he would work toward this end , but would also be frank but constructive about policy differences .
