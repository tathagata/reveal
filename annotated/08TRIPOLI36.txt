( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: The recent decision by a [LOC U.S.  ] judge to award roughly $6 billion in damages to families of seven [MISC Americans  ] killed in [LOC Libya  ] 's 1989 bombing of a [MISC French-operated  ] [ORG UTA  ] passenger plane has apparently caught the [ORG GOL  ] off-guard and angered elements within the [ORG GOL  ] . 
The [ORG MFA  ] told us the award would " greatly complicate " [MISC U.S.-Libya  ] ties . 
In a letter to the Secretary ( septel ) , Secretary of the General People 's Committee SIPDIS for Foreign Liaison and [ORG International Cooperation  ] ( [ORG FM-equivalent  ] ) [PER Abdhurrahman Shalgham  ] requested [ORG USG  ] intervention in the case on behalf of the [ORG GOL  ] , as well as intervention with the [ORG Congress  ] to rescind a provision in the 2008 [ORG Defense Authorization Bill  ] that would facilitate lawsuits against states accused of sponsoring terrorism . 
The [ORG GOL  ] intends to send a legal team to the [LOC U.S.  ] soon to discuss the [ORG UTA  ] case and possibly other pending terrorism-related cases as well , according to the [ORG MFA  ] . 
End summary . 
THREE TIMES AS BIG AS PAN AM 103 2 . 
( U ) According to press reports , which also appeared in [MISC Arabic  ] language media , [ORG U.S. District Court  ] Judge [PER Henry Kennedy January  ] 15 awarded approximately $6 billion in damages to families of seven [LOC U.S.  ] victims killed the September 1989 bombing of [MISC French-operated  ] [ORG UTA  ] flight 772 . 
The $6 billion award , to be paid by the [ORG GOL  ] and six [MISC Libyan  ] intelligence officials convicted of involvement in executing the attack , is roughly three times the total compensation package in the case of Pan Am flight 103 . 
The [ORG UTA  ] 772 award represents the value of the aircraft , compensation for pain and suffering of the victims , compensation for the pain and suffering of the victims' families , compensation for expected earnings had the victims lived and interest backdated to the date of the bombing . 
The [ORG GOL  ] has until February 25 to appeal Judge [PER Kennedy  ] 's decision . 
As we understand it , if there is no appeal and/or negotiations on a settlement by February 25 , claimants can attempt to seize [MISC Libyan  ] government assets to satisfy the judgment . 
JUDGMENT A " CONSIDERABLE SHOCK " FOR THE [ORG GOL  ] .. . 
3 . 
( C ) Former [MISC French  ] Ambassador to [LOC Tripoli  ] , [PER Jean-Jacques Beaussou  ] , a consultant for the [ORG UTA  ] 772 claimants' counsel , [LOC U.S.  ] law firm [ORG Crowell & Moring  ] , briefed the [ORG CDA  ] and A/DCM January 16 on his efforts to engage the [ORG GOL  ] on next steps in the case . 
He said the [ORG GOL  ] 's direct liability is approximately $1.5 billion ; the remaining $4.5 billion is to be paid by the six convicted [MISC Libyan  ] intelligence officers . 
Noting that the [ORG GOL  ] decided last fall not to continue negotiations for an out-of-court settlement for [ORG UTA  ] 772 involving a much smaller damages award , he said Judge [PER Kennedy  ] 's decision was a " considerable shock " for the regime. .. . 
WHICH IS SCRAMBLING TO FORMULATE A RESPONSE 4 . 
( C ) According to [PER Beaussou  ] , the [ORG GOL  ] believed the proposed out-of-court settlement amount would have prompted families of [MISC French  ] victims , who settled in 2004 for approximately $170 million , to ask for more compensation . 
It also cited concern about adverse [MISC Libyan  ] public reaction to the proposed out-of-court settlement amount . 
Judge [PER Kennedy  ] 's $6 billion damages award suggests the [ORG GOL  ] 's calculus was flawed , creating a political problem for the [ORG GOL  ] and exposing the [ORG GOL  ] 's claims litigation committee headed by [PER Ahmad Mesalati  ] to criticism that it has bungled management of the case . 
[PER Mesalati  ] , who is typically able to meet [PER Beaussou  ] in person , declined January 16 , saying he first had to consult with key regime figures , who were " surprised " by the award and were working to formulate a strategy . 
[ORG POSSIBLE SCENARIOS  ] 5 . 
( C ) Referencing conversations with counsel for the [LOC U.S.  ] claimants , [PER Beaussou  ] speculated that the unanticipated size of the judgment might constitute sufficient " shock therapy " to prompt the [ORG GOL  ] to negotiate payment terms or , should it appeal , an out-of-court settlement . 
[PER Beaussou  ] sees four possible scenarios for the [ORG GOL:  ] 1 ) pay the damages ( not a likely outcome , in his view ) ; 2 ) appeal the decision ( also not likely in his view , as the [ORG GOL  ] must deposit a sizeable portion of the award in [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000036 002.2 OF 003 an escrow account pending outcome of the appeal ) ; 3 ) refuse to pay and ignore the court 's judgment ( the most likely outcome in his view , and the most injurious to [MISC U.S.-Libyan  ] relations ) ; or 4 ) use the judgment as a pretext to work out a comprehensive compensation package covering all outstanding claims agains the [ORG GOL  ] in [LOC U.S.  ] courts . 
[PER Beaussou  ] noted that option three ( non-payment and ignoring the judgment ) could allow claimants to begin efforts to attach [MISC Libyan  ] assets , including eight [MISC C-130  ] aircraft stored in [LOC Georgia  ] , whose delivery to the [ORG GOL  ] was blocked in the 1970 's and which have been a neuralgic issue for the [ORG GOL  ] . 
( Note: Further discussion of the [MISC C-130  ] 's during visiting AFRICOM General [PER Herbert Altshuler  ] 's January 15-16 reported septel . 
End note . 
) MFA: AWARD WILL " GREATLY COMPLICATE " BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP 6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Ahmed Fituri  ] , [ORG MFA  ] Secretary for the [LOC Americas  ] , flatly told the [ORG CDA  ] and A/DCM January 17 that the [ORG UTA  ] 772 decision would " greatly complicate " relations . 
He noted that there were " several " senior-level [ORG GOL  ] discussions January 16 that lasted all day and involved - by phone or in person - [PER Saif al-Islam  ] al-Qadhafi , [ORG National Security Adviser  ] [MISC Mutassim  ] al-Qadhafi , Prime Minister al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi , Foreign Minister [PER Shalgham  ] , [ORG Deputy External Security Organization  ] Chief [PER Abdullah Sanussi  ] and [ORG MFA  ] Secretary for [ORG European Affairs  ] [PER Abdulati Obeidi  ] . 
( Note: The involvement of [ORG NSA  ] [MISC Mutassim  ] al-Qadhafi is potentially troublesome given his remarks in meetings last August and November with visiting [ORG NEA A/S Welch and S/CT Coordinator Dell Dailey  ] , respectively , to the effect that the [ORG GOL  ] feels it has paid enough compensation in claims cases and that the [ORG U.S. Congress  ] should adopt legislation preventing any further claims . 
End note . 
) [PER Fituri  ] added that another high-level meeting had been scheduled for late January 17 to continue discussions on how the [ORG GOL  ] will respond . 
7 . 
( C ) [PER Fituri  ] offered his " personal opinion " that the planned visit of musician [PER Robert McNamara  ] , who received a PAS grant to give guitar concerts and lead master classes in [LOC Benghazi  ] and [LOC Tripoli  ] in late January , was ill-timed in light of the [ORG UTA  ] 772 decision and recommended that we postpone . 
The " [MISC Libyan  ] people " would not view favorably the confluence of the [ORG UTA  ] decision , [PER McNamara  ] 's concerts and the upcoming General People 's [ORG Congress  ] ( scheduled to open in mid-February ) , and would wonder why the [ORG GOL  ] was facilitating cultural exchanges at a time when it had been " insulted " by the [ORG UTA  ] 772 judgment . 
The [ORG CDA  ] told [PER Fituri  ] we 'd take his remarks under advisement ; we subsequently learned that the [ORG MFA  ] had rescinded [PER McNamara  ] 's visa approval . 
8 . 
( C ) In a follow-on January 21 meeting with [ORG CDA  ] , [PER Fituri  ] said that the [ORG GOL  ] response would comprise a letter from FM [ORG Shalgam  ] to the Secretary requesting the [ORG Administration  ] 's intervention with the court to facilitate a [ORG GOL  ] appeal of the judgment . 
According to [PER Fituri  ] , the court requires that the [ORG GOL  ] make a large deposit upon appeal ; the [ORG GOL  ] would like to avoid making this payment by way of a [ORG USG  ] guarantee to the court . 
[ORG Shalgam  ] would also request that the [ORG Administration  ] intevene with the [ORG Congress  ] to rescind a provision in the 2008 [ORG Defense Authorization Act  ] known as " the [PER Lautenberg Amendment  ] . 
" This provision facilitates private lawsuits against states accused of sponsoring terrorism , in particular by making it easier for victorious claimants to seize foreign government assets . 
The [ORG GOL  ] would also send a team of " three or four " lawyers to the [LOC U.S.  ] to discuss the [ORG UTA  ] case and perhaps other cases ( i.e. , [ORG La Belle  ] ) with the claimants' lawyers . 
The team will be headed by litigation claims chair [PER Mesalati  ] , who is scheduled to travel to the [LOC U.S.  ] on January 23 . 
COMMENT <a id='par9' href='#par9'>Â¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG Shalgam  ] letter to Secretary Rice is vague as to what the [ORG GOL  ] wants and intends . 
It does not specifically mention an appeal nor does it specifically state that the [ORG GOL  ] is sending the team of lawyers . 
It remains unclear to the Embassy why the appeal option seems to be preferred if the same result -- delaying the day of judgment and negotiating a favorable payment -- could be attained by beginning a negotiation with the claimants' lawyers . 
This would elimiinate the need for a large deposit with the court . 
It may be that the [ORG GOL  ] assesses that it can come to a more favorable out of court settlement with an appeal pending . 
10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) After a four-month period of relatively good bilateral cooperation bracketed by [ORG NEA A/S Welch  ] 's August 2007 visit and FM [PER Shalgham  ] 's January 2008 trip to [LOC Washington  ] , we may be on the cusp of another downturn in relations , unless the [ORG GOL  ] engages [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000036 003.2 OF 003 seriously on the [ORG UTA  ] case . 
We made the point to [PER Fituri  ] that the thrust of FM [PER Shalgham  ] 's recent visit to [LOC Washington  ] and our senior-level discourse was to broaden and deepen bilateral ties in a way that made them more durable and less subject to lingering issues like the claims cases . 
[PER Fituri  ] was polite , but made it clear that the quarters of the [ORG GOL  ] that really count continue to interpret developments such as the [ORG UTA  ] 772 decision as political signals and may retaliate by putting the brakes on the kind of broader engagement we seek . 
This would not augur well for our efforts to move forward with education and economic reform programs , a human rights dialogue , counter-terrorism finance training and other forms of expanded cooperation .
