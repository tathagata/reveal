[PER James Foley  ] , reasons 1.4 ( b ) & ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [MISC SUMMARY: After  ] making difficult concessions in order to conclude an [ORG Arbitration Agreement  ] with [LOC Slovenia  ] , Prime Minister [PER Kosor  ] now confronts an ongoing [LOC UK  ] and [LOC Netherlands  ] blockage of [MISC Croatia’s  ] [ORG EU  ] accession path , inspired by [ORG ICTY  ] Prosecutor [PER Serge Brammertz  ] . 
This impasse has the potential to endure as the [ORG GOC  ] likely cannot produce documents demanded by the prosecutor , and [PER Brammertz  ] seems unwilling to settle for anything besides the documents . 
[PER Brammertz  ] also refuses to assist the [ORG GOC  ] in its investigation . 
Importantly , the impasse could undermine the [LOC U.S.  ] stake both in the [MISC Kosor-led  ] reform process in [LOC Croatia  ] and the region’s integration into [MISC Euro-Atlantic  ] institutions . 
Accordingly , post recommends that we register our differences with Brammertz’s assessment at the December 3 [ORG UNSC  ] discussion of [ORG ICTY  ] and consider high-level approaches to the [LOC UK  ] and [LOC Netherlands  ] urging that the [ORG EU  ] make [MISC Croatia’s  ] [ORG ICTY  ] cooperation a closing rather than an opening benchmark for Chapter 23 accession negotiations . 
END SUMMARY . 
[MISC CROATIA’S  ] EFFORTS TO SATISFY [ORG ICTY  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Prime Minister [PER Kosor  ] , Justice Minister [PER Simonovic  ] , Interior Minister [PER Karamarko  ] and Chief State Prosecutor [PER Bajic  ] all met with visiting Special Envoy for [MISC War Crimes Issues Ambassador  ] [PER Stephen Rapp  ] and Ambassador [PER Foley  ] on November 27 , to describe [MISC Croatia’s  ] continuing efforts to cooperate with the [ORG ICTY  ] and Prosecutor [PER Serge Brammertz  ] in the search for missing artillery documents in connection with the 1995 [MISC Operation Storm  ] and the [PER Gotovina  ] case . 
The discussions focused on the results of [MISC Croatia’s  ] recent police-led [ORG Task Force  ] formed specifically to address objections [PER Brammertz  ] had raised with earlier efforts by [LOC Croatia  ] to locate the documents . 
The [ORG Task Force’s  ] status report , sent to [ORG ICTY  ] on November 9 , states that [LOC Croatia  ] provided [ORG ICTY  ] with three of the 23 documents sought ( as well as a partial draft of a fourth ) , four others were never created , seven were destroyed , and eight have not been located. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) All [ORG GOC  ] officials insisted that [LOC Croatia  ] is engaged in a good faith effort to locate whatever documents , if any , that can be found , and pledged that the investigation would continue . 
Prime Minister [PER Kosor  ] declared to Ambassador [PER Rapp  ] that the [ORG GOC  ] had an “absolute political will” to find the documents or establish their chain of custody and said she had issued orders for the investigation to continue . 
She commented that it would be “absolutely stupid” for [LOC Croatia  ] to jeopardize its otherwise imminent [ORG EU  ] accession “over a few documents , ” noting that General Gotovina’s rendition to The [ORG Hague  ] was the work of the [ORG GOC  ] . 
[PER Karamarko  ] predicted that if [PER Brammertz  ] gave a good grade to [LOC Serbia  ] despite its failure to render Mladic and [PER Hadzic  ] while giving a negative grade to [LOC Croatia  ] over missing documents “that may or may not exist , ” it could have “dangerous” internal repercussions . 
[PER Bajic  ] echoed this , stating that an [ORG EU  ] decision not to open Chapter 23 would be a “major setback to [LOC Croatia  ] in terms of the reform process and those who have been involved in it.” ( [PER NOTE: Bajic  ] was apparently alluding to his own anti-corruption efforts backed by [PER Kosor  ] . 
END NOTE ) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Rapp  ] told [PER Kosor  ] and others the [ORG Task Force’s  ] work was a “good faith” and “impressive” effort . 
Post shares this assessment of the [ORG Task Force’s  ] work as credible and indicative of a significant effort by the [ORG GOC  ] to cooperate with the [ORG ICTY  ] . 
The investigation is far from perfect , relying too heavily on interviews with individuals connected to the documents . 
In our Nov. 27 meetings , we suggested ways that the continuing investigation could be made more aggressive . 
However , we have no reason to believe that the [ORG GOC  ] lacks the will to find the documents or is seeking to thwart the [ORG ICTY  ] . 
The artillery documents have likely been destroyed or sequestered over the years by [PER Gotovina  ] and his associates . 
[ORG ICTY  ] CANNOT BE SATISFIED <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Brammertz  ] for his part remains unwilling to acknowledge the full degree of [MISC Croatia’s  ] cooperation . 
In his written report to the [ORG UNSC  ] he notes only that “results are limited” . 
While proclaiming himself “satisfied” with [MISC Serbian  ] efforts that have nonetheless failed to produce the fugitive indictees , [PER Brammertz  ] seems unwilling to accept [MISC Croatian  ] efforts as satisfactory unless they actually produce the missing papers . 
RESULT: IMPASSE ZAGREB 00000694 002 OF 003 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) The immediate problem is that several [ORG EU  ] member states ( in particular the [LOC UK  ] and the [LOC Netherlands  ] ) have refused to allow [LOC Croatia  ] to open accession negotiations on Chapter 23 ( Judiciary and [ORG Fundamental Rights  ] ) pending a clean bill of health on [ORG ICTY  ] cooperation . 
[PER Brammertz  ] has indicated that he will continue to demand that [LOC Croatia  ] produce the missing documents throughout the entirety of the appeals process . 
Thus [LOC Croatia  ] could be facing a prolonged and indefinite blockage of its [ORG EU  ] accession. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [LOC UK  ] Ambassador [PER Blunt  ] ( protect ) told Ambassador [PER Foley  ] last week that some key officials in [LOC London  ] regard [LOC Croatia  ] as virtually unchanged since the [MISC Tudjman  ] era and are inclined to assume [ORG GOC  ] bad faith in its dealings with the [ORG ICTY  ] . 
[LOC UK  ] Ministers were unlikely to budge on [ORG Chapter  ] 23 in the face of a negative assessment from [PER Brammertz  ] . 
However , [PER Blunt  ] personally agreed that the missing artillery documents likely could not be found by the [ORG GOC  ] , and that [PER Brammertz  ] had no interest in either assisting the [ORG GOC  ] investigation or accepting as adequate any [MISC Croatian  ] effort that does not produce the documents . 
[PER Blunt  ] suggested that a visit by Ambassador [PER Rapp  ] to [LOC London  ] to acquaint senior officials with these realities might offer the only hope for a reassessment of the entrenched [LOC UK  ] position. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [MISC French  ] Ambassador [PER Pasquier  ] told Ambassador [PER Foley  ] on November 28 that [LOC Paris  ] was deeply concerned about Brammertz’s expected contrasting assessments of [MISC Serbian  ] and [MISC Croatian  ] cooperation . 
He stressed that [LOC France  ] supports and does not wish to jeopardize Serbia’s progress , but fears that a simultaneous rejection of [MISC Croatia’s  ] efforts and the continued blockage of [ORG Chapter  ] 23 would badly damage public support for [ORG EU  ] membership and [PER Kosor  ] herself . 
He expected that [LOC France  ] would be prepared to back [LOC Croatia  ] and implicitly dissent from Brammertz’s assessment in the [ORG Security Council  ] on December 3 . 
But he stressed that hope for unblocking [ORG Chapter  ] 23 depended on [PER Brammertz  ] adjusting his language and finding a way on December 3 to acknowledge progress and cooperation on the part of the [ORG GOC  ] . 
That might be enough , he thought , to persuade the [LOC UK  ] and [LOC Netherlands  ] to allow the opening of [ORG Chapter  ] 23 . 
A NEW [LOC U.S.  ] APPROACH <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The stakes for the [LOC U.S.  ] of an enduring impasse on this issue are high -- not only a prolonged blockage of [MISC Croatia’s  ] [ORG EU  ] accession with implications for internal stability , but a closed [ORG EU  ] door to the rest of [LOC Southeastern Europe  ] . 
We therefore propose a [LOC U.S.  ] effort aimed at unblocking [MISC Croatia’s  ] [ORG Chapter  ] 23 negotiations and encouraging intensified [MISC Croatian  ] efforts to cooperate with the [ORG ICTY  ] . 
One aspect of this strategy would be to urge the [ORG EU  ] to bring more factors into its assessment of cooperation than simply the [MISC Prosecutor’s  ] judgment . 
In this regard , we note that the [ORG ICTY Trial Chamber  ] will hold a hearing on the document issue on December 16 , although it is unlikely to issue a ruling until after the new year . 
Another aspect would be to press [PER Brammertz  ] to show more readiness to accept a credible investigation by the [MISC Croatians  ] as adequate cooperation , and to provide assistance to [MISC Croatian  ] efforts . 
Ultimately , we should urge the [ORG EU  ] to allow Chapter 23 to open , with a closing benchmark being the implementation of further steps to bolster the credibility of the continuing [ORG GOC  ] investigation or the delivery of the requested documentation. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) To set the stage for this approach , post supports Ambassador Rapp’s efforts vis a vis [PER Mr. Brammertz  ] in advance of the December 3 [ORG UNSC  ] session , and recommends the following points be addressed in the [LOC U.S.  ] statement at that session if our assessment of [MISC Croatian  ] cooperation remains at variance with his: -- Cooperation with the [ORG ICTY  ] remains a fundamental obligation for all states in the region , and a sine qua non of [MISC Euro-Atlantic  ] integration ; -- We note that [LOC Croatia  ] has engaged in extensive efforts to respond to the Trial Chamber’s order of September 2008 to deliver or engage in a credible investigation into the fate of the requested artillery documentation from [MISC Operation Storm  ] ; -- In our judgment those efforts have been conducted in good faith , and we believe that the Government of [MISC Croatia’s  ] latest investigation , which is continuing , is credible and represents a significant step forward in [MISC Croatia’s  ] cooperation with the [ORG ICTY  ] ; -- At the same time , we believe the [MISC Croatian  ] efforts should be improved and would encourage the [MISC Croatian  ] authorities to ZAGREB 00000694 003 OF 003 explore additional measures such as using outside expertise and engaging in more aggressive investigative techniques ; -- For that reason , we are concerned with the [MISC Prosecutor’s  ] apparent reluctance to engage directly with the [MISC Croatian  ] investigators in providing advice on investigative measures , and we would encourage him to reconsider that approach. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Post expects Minister of Justice [PER Simonovic  ] to represent [LOC Croatia  ] in the December 3 [ORG Security Council  ] session . 
[PER Simonovic  ] told us that at present [LOC Croatia  ] anticipates statements of support in the [ORG Security Council  ] from [LOC France  ] , [LOC Austria  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] and potentially additional members .
