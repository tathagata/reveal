( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: Indigenous conflict -- particularly between [ORG Mapuche  ] and non-indigenous land owners in southern [LOC Chile  ] -- has forced itself prominently on to President [PER Bachelet  ] 's political agenda following the August 12 police killing of a [ORG Mapuche  ] activist . 
Over the past 20 years , relations between the government and [ORG Mapuche  ] communities have been characterized by half-hearted attempts by the government and fractious organization and demands by the [ORG Mapuche  ] , creating disappointment and frustration that perpetuate tension . 
[ORG Mapuche  ] demands center on land , economic opportunity , and societal inclusion , but are poorly defined and vary greatly from community to community . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Poloff and [ORG Pol Specialist  ] travelled to the heart of [LOC Chile  ] 's [ORG Mapuche  ] territory , the regions of [LOC Araucania  ] and [PER Los Rios  ] , August 10-14 . 
Reftel described the reality of tense , but generally non-violent , relations in contrast to the sensationalized images of the region . 
Septel will describe human right concerns and the justice process . 
After [MISC Mapuche Death  ] , [ORG Indigenous Issues Claim Center Stage  ] --------------------------------------------- ------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) The August 12 police killing of [ORG Mapuche  ] activist [PER Jaime Mendoza  ] -- and the subsequent reaction from indigenous communities -- has catapulted indigenous demands to the front of President [PER Bachelet  ] 's political agenda once again . 
[ORG Mapuche  ] activists held protests and blockaded a highway , while more than 3,000 mourners packed [PER Mendoza  ] 's funeral . 
When President [PER Bachelet  ] sent a government delegation , led by the Under Secretary of the Presidency , to meet with all parties in [LOC Araucania  ] , the [ORG Mapuche  ] community refused to meet with the group . 
[PER Bachelet  ] subsequently named a cabinet minister , [PER Jose Antonio Viera-Gallo  ] , as the government 's new indigenous policy coordinator , effectively capitulating to a long-standing [ORG Mapuche  ] demand for higher-level government attention . 
Meanwhile , another indigenous group -- [ORG Easter Islanders  ] -- seem to have been inspired by [ORG Mapuche  ] activism , recently occupying the island 's only airport for 24 hours in a successful effort to gain government attention to their demands . 
Dashed [PER Hopes: Concertacion  ] 's Failed Indigenous Policies --------------------------------------------- ----------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Chile  ] 's return to democracy seemed to be a promising beginning for relations between the state and the [MISC Mapuche  ] community after a history of conflict ( reftel ) . 
The 1993 [ORG Indigenous Law  ] legally recognized ethnic communities for the first time ; protected current indigenous lands ; created a fund to secure additional lands claimed by indigenous communities ; established an indigenous development fund ; and formed the [ORG National Corporation  ] for [ORG Indigenous Development  ] ( [ORG CONADI  ] ) , a new government body charged with implementing indigenous policy. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Despite this encouraging start , indigenous [MISC Chileans  ] have become frustrated with the [PER Concertacion  ] 's broken promises , government inaction , and inefficient administration . 
Under [PER Ricardo Lagos  ] ( 1998-2004 ) , the government approved the construction of a hydroelectric dam in [MISC Mapuche  ] areas , despite more than a decade of strenuous objections from [ORG Mapuche  ] activists . 
He later issued a last minute and poorly explained cancellation to what would have been the largest ever meeting between the [ORG Mapuche  ] community and the [MISC Chilean  ] President , angering thousands who had travelled from across the country for the dialogue. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) For her part , President [PER Bachelet  ] has been slow to focus on indigenous issues . 
She announced her indigenous policy , Re-Conocer , more than half way through her four-year term and in response to the outcry over the police shooting death of a [ORG Mapuche  ] activist in January 2008 . 
Critics charge ( and privately some [ORG CONADI  ] officials agree ) that Re-Conocer is just re-packaging previous policies and creating more bureaucracy . 
[PER Bachelet  ] 's presidential commissioner for indigenous affairs , [PER Rodrigo Egana  ] , was described by a prominent civic leader and close friend as " focused elsewhere . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Moreover , the very organization that was meant to assist indigenous [MISC Chileans  ] , [ORG CONADI  ] , has become a lightning rod for native criticism . 
[ORG CONADI  ] is decried as a bureaucratic and lethargic organization which , by looking to hire talented indigenous professionals , has co-opted many of the indigenous communities' best leaders . 
More than 90% of the agency 's budget is dedicated to purchasing ancestral lands , yet land disputes appear to be worsening rather than subsiding . 
[ORG CONADI  ] aims to boost opportunities for indigenous [MISC Chileans  ] through scholarships and micro-enterprise support , but these grants are small ( average USD 6,000 for micro-enterprises ) , short-term , and labor-intensive to administer , further eating up resources . 
Several [ORG Mapuche  ] and non-indigenous sources told us that only 30% of [ORG CONADI  ] 's budget actually reaches the communities it intends to serve , with the rest being lost to bureaucracy , waste , and inflated land prices . 
Land , Opportunity , and Respect: [ORG Mapuche  ] Demands --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) The recovery of traditional [ORG Mapuche  ] lands is the most common trigger for violent conflict and property destruction . 
[ORG Mapuche  ] communities now live on just 6% of the territory they once controlled -- an unsettling situation for a people whose name means " people of the land . 
" Activists are quick to point out that some wealthy white [MISC Chilean  ] individuals -- such as forestry magnate [PER Roberto Angelini  ] -- own more land in traditional [ORG Mapuche  ] areas than the entire [ORG Mapuche  ] population combined . 
On the other hand , non-indigenous [MISC Chileans  ] often have strong ties to the formerly [ORG Mapuche  ] land they now own . 
Due to government colonization policies , some non-indigenous [MISC Chileans  ] have lived on traditional [ORG Mapuche  ] lands for generations , while many prominent businessmen have made substantial investments in land that they bought legally. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The 1993 [ORG Indigenous Law  ] , while designed to address these land concerns , has in some ways exacerbated the situation . 
The law provided a mechanism and funding to buy back traditional [ORG Mapuche  ] land , but failed to set expectations about how much land would be recovered . 
The resulting process has been expensive , extremely slow , and resulted in less new land for [MISC Mapuches  ] than they expected . 
Non-indigenous land owners often engage in price gouging , raising prices for disputed land to ridiculous levels , limiting the amount of land that can be purchased with budgeted funds . 
While the [MISC Chilean  ] government has transferred more than 650,000 hectares for [ORG Mapuche  ] use , the vast majority of this land was already de facto [MISC Mapuche  ] territory -- the purchase simply regularized the facts on the ground . 
Human rights campaigner [PER Jose Aylwin  ] told poloffs that only about 100,000 hectares of new land has been turned over to [MISC Mapuches  ] since 1993. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Aside from land disputes , poverty , lack of opportunity , and discrimination by majority [MISC Chilean  ] culture are all underlying causes of conflict . 
The poverty rate for indigenous people is 12 percentage points higher than for non-indigenous populations . 
[LOC Araucania  ] -- the region with the highest percentage of [ORG Mapuche  ] residents -- has the country 's highest unemployment rate , nearly 11 percent . 
And [MISC Mapuches  ] face widespread discrimination . 
Multiculturalism is an uncommon term in a country that takes pride in its unitary " Chileanness , " which is enshrined in the constitution . 
[ORG Mapuche  ] academics in [LOC Temuco  ] and [LOC Valdivia  ] told [LOC Poloffs  ] of experiences demonstrating how anti-Mapuche racism is acceptable even among well-educated [MISC Chileans  ] . 
Typical [MISC Chilean  ] attitudes toward [MISC Mapuches  ] range from ignorance to distrust . 
Who Speaks for the [ORG Mapuche  ] ? --------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The decentralized hierarchy and diffuse leadership that characterize [ORG Mapuche  ] culture ( described as a " multi-headed hydra " by one academic ) impede community efforts to organize and complicate [MISC Chilean  ] government efforts to find a valid negotiating partner . 
[ORG Mapuche  ] villages are traditionally quite independent from one another , and are led by lonkos , or tribal chiefs . 
Traditionally , no authority exists beyond the lonko , meaning that no single person or organization speaks for the [ORG Mapuche  ] . 
Because each lonko is viewed as the ultimate authority for his , admittedly very small , group of [MISC Mapuches  ] , slights are inevitable as some [MISC Mapuches  ] claim that each lonko should have access directly to the President , who represents the ultimate authority in majoritarian [MISC Chilean  ] culture . 
Even more realistic [ORG Mapuche  ] activists bristle when lonkos can not get meetings with the regional intendente ( centrally appointed governor ) and instead deal with lower-ranking civil servants. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The on-going conflict with the government has led to the creation of new leadership structures across and within communities , from the sometimes violent [ORG Coordinadora Arauco Malleco  ] ( [ORG CAM  ] ) to the more pacifist Council of [LOC All Lands  ] , to community-specific organizations with elected leadership . 
The newly created [ORG Mapuche Territorial Alliance  ] aims to unite disparate [ORG Mapuche  ] communities in a peaceful struggle for land rights . 
Within communities , the [MISC Chilean  ] government has dictated that it will work only with elected representative [ORG Mapuche  ] councils , leading to the creation of new bodies which supporters say are an effective way to make decisions and interact with the government , while detractors lament the loss of lonko authority and say that the council members have been co-opted. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) These new organizations , and the positions that some of them take , reflect the deep divisions in the [ORG Mapuche  ] community . 
There is no consensus on what approach to take in seeking redress , or even on what the community 's issues and goals are . 
In meetings with two lonkos in neighboring communities , one described his efforts to promote community-based tourism , gain access to [ORG CONADI  ] resources and grants , and share traditional knowledge about local wildlife . 
In contrast , another lonko described his work on a proposal that would demand the return of all land from the [LOC Biobio  ] river to the city of [LOC Palena  ] -- an area compromising the majority of four of [LOC Chile  ] 's 15 regions -- end all major investment projects in the region , and dismantle [ORG CONADI.  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Comment: There is plenty of blame in [LOC Chile  ] 's long-standing [ORG Mapuche  ] conflict to spread to all parties . 
[ORG Mapuche  ] communities are disorganized and incoherent , offering up a range of demands from the logical to the fanciful , and rarely coordinating their efforts . 
A small number of violent actors discredit those who work in good faith to advance legitimate grievances . 
On the other hand , successive Concertacion governments have bungled indigenous policy , perpetually making it a low priority and failing to set and meet realistic expectations . 
Even with [PER Bachelet  ] 's decision to designate a new , and higher-ranking indigenous policy coordinator , it is difficult to envision substantial progress in resolving this complex , long-standing issue .
