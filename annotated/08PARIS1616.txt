( C ) SUMMARY: On August 21 , [ORG French Elysee Advisor  ] [PER Boris Boillon  ] and [ORG MFA A/S  ] for [ORG Eurasia  ] [PER Roland Galharague  ] , who traveled with FM [PER Kouchner  ] to the region , provided us with a consistent interpretation of the arrival of [ORG OSCE  ] monitors: the new monitors are responding to the emergency situation ; they are not the new international mechanism referred to in point 5 and do not prejudge the eventual international arrangements . 
[PER Galharague  ] welcomed reftel demarche . 
Pol M-C emphasized the need for [LOC Russia  ] to respect its commitments to retreat , and encouraged active consideration of what will happen on August 22 if [MISC Russian  ] forces have not fully withdrawn . 
Post will remain seized of these and related questions in the days to come . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On August 21 , [ORG French Elysee Advisor  ] [PER Boris Boillon  ] ( [LOC Middle East  ] advisor with acting responsibility for this portfolio ) explained that the arrival of the [ORG OSCE  ] monitors in the coming days are part of the security measures mentioned in point 5 of the six point document , but only in the sense of meeting the immediate emergency . 
The 500 [MISC Russians  ] who will continue their patrols will be in contact with ( work with ) the [ORG OSCE  ] monitors and others , undefined , in the zone . 
But this is just a preliminary measure to meet the urgent conditions . 
There still needs to be an international discussion to find an international mechanism to put in place . 
Until then , these other temporary measures will be needed to meet the emergency. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Later on August 21 , [ORG MFA A/S-equivalent  ] for [ORG Eurasia  ] and the [MISC Balkans  ] [PER Roland Galharague  ] described the coming days as critical and decisive for the situation in [LOC Georgia  ] as well as relations with [LOC Russia  ] . 
Whether this crisis is a " one-off " for [LOC Russia  ] or the beginning of a new dynamic is not yet fully clear . 
[LOC France  ] 's current goal is to advance the political process for implementation of the [MISC Sarkozy-brokered  ] six-point plan . 
He said that beyond a long-term stop to hostilities and a [MISC Russian  ] retreat , the key priority is establishing international arrangements as soon as possible to deny [LOC Russia  ] a pretext for maintaining its presence in [LOC Georgia  ] . 
[PER Galharague  ] stated that the [ORG EU  ] GAERC conclusions created a mandate to pursue a [ORG UN Security Council Resolution  ] , but that [LOC France  ] is further motivated to pursue one due to the belief that it would create the best basis for protecting [MISC Georgian  ] interests . 
In order to implement point 5 of the cease-fire , one and only one " international mechanism " is needed , and one to which [LOC Russia  ] is not a third party. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Galharague  ] said the [MISC French  ] [ORG Mission  ] to the [ORG UN  ] is working on a revised draft [ORG UNSCR  ] today that would cite in extenso the six-point plan and refer to an international mechanism . 
To establish more clarity on the ground in [LOC Georgia  ] as quickly as possible , existing mandates such as the [ORG OSCE  ] monitoring one should be taken advantage of , and can be followed by missions that first require new mandates . 
Both our current ground information and the signs coming from the [MISC Russian  ] government are contradictory and often unverifiable . 
It is not clear whether they are taking steps to withdraw by the 22nd . 
He said the primary [MISC European  ] and Allied interest is to establish a new international dynamic permitting the rest of the international community to regain some control over [LOC Russia  ] 's actions . 
He said [LOC France  ] had not established any concrete benchmarks for [LOC Russia  ] 's retreat from [LOC Georgia  ] , in the belief that more flexibility meant more opportunity to exert political pressure on [LOC Russia  ] . 
He noted that [LOC Russia  ] 's goal would be to consolidate their positions while changing their force posture to " peacekeeping " mode . 
Regarding [LOC France  ] 's definition of point 5 , he referred us to President [PER Sarkozy  ] 's letter stating that while awaiting an international mechanism , [MISC Russian  ] forces can remain in the immediate proximity of [LOC South Ossetia  ] . 
He reiterated the need for a [ORG UNSCR  ] , this time to replace the 1992 cease-fire agreement ( and a 1999 understanding ) that [LOC Russia  ] currently uses as its point of reference for " 500 troops " and to give the international community more flexibility . 
He pointed out that the same 1990 , s agreements posit a similar number of [MISC Georgian  ] and [LOC South Ossetian  ] patrols , and noted that , s obviously a mandate [LOC Georgia  ] can , t fulfill now and another reason to supercede it . 
He said that a strengthened [ORG OSCE  ] [LOC PARIS  ] 00001616 002 OF 002 monitoring mission would be due to urgency only , and would not prejudge the political process or the eventual international arrangements for long-term resolution . 
[PER COMMENT: Galharague  ] 's interpretation was fully consistent with what we heard from [PER Boillon  ] shortly beforehand . 
END COMMENT. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Regarding the [ORG EU  ] 's role , [PER Galharague  ] said that whether a [ORG European Council  ] might be convened would depend on developments . 
He said there was more consensus than expected at the GAERC , as [LOC France  ] had not planned to issue conclusions . 
He said the [ORG EU  ] has a consistent objective to gain more control of [LOC Russia  ] 's actions in the international arena , and that that shared basis for action would remain unanimous. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Galharague  ] hypothesized that [LOC Russia  ] 's strategy for [LOC Georgia  ] was to produce " [LOC Kosovo  ] in reverse , " only accelerated , with [PER Saakashvili  ] in the role of [PER Milosevic  ] , [LOC Russia  ] in the role of [ORG NATO  ] , etc . 
However , he said it was too early to speculate about whether the crisis in [LOC Georgia  ] was just " tit for tat " for [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
He said in his view , [LOC Russia  ] viewed the situation as a " win-win " - regardless of the outcome of the status of [LOC South Ossetia  ] and [LOC Abkhazia  ] , [LOC Russia  ] has had its revenge for [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
He noted that [LOC Russia  ] will have more presence and operate " more easily " in a more tense international climate . 
[PER Galharague  ] welcomed reftel demarche , while expressing interest in further information regarding [LOC U.S.  ] strategy in the crisis , including at the [ORG UN  ] . 
Pol M-C emphasized the need for [LOC Russia  ] to respect its commitments to retreat , and encouraged active consideration of what will happen on August 22 if [MISC Russian  ] forces have not fully withdrawn .
