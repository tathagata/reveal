[LOC BRASILIA  ] 93 <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
[PER BRASILIA  ] 175 <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] met with [MISC Brazilian  ] Minister of Defense [PER Nelson Jobim  ] Feb. 13 to discuss [PER Jobim  ] 's upcoming visit to [LOC Washington  ] , regional security and progress on defense cooperation . 
[PER Jobim  ] agreed with Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] 's outline of possible areas for discussion during his March visit to [LOC Washington  ] , including further discussion of a defense cooperation agreement . 
He also signaled that [LOC Brazil  ] would be open to discussions regarding negotiation of a General Security of [ORG Military Information Agreement  ] ( [ORG GSOMIA  ] ) and a [ORG Status of Forces Agreement  ] ( [ORG SOFA  ] ) , similar to that concluded with [LOC France  ] . 
Chief of Ministry Staff [PER Murilo Marques Barboza  ] said that a [ORG GSOMIA  ] had been discussed in the past , but had broken down over arrangements for " inspections " of [MISC Brazilian  ] facilities . 
This probably reflects [MISC Brazilian  ] sensitivities over allowing [LOC U.S.  ] access to military facilities , even with reciprocal access to those in the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Jobim  ] and [PER Barboza  ] indicated openness to renewing a dialogue on a [ORG GSOMIA  ] , but in order to complete such an agreement , the " inspections " will need a clearer characterization as reciprocal visits . 
[PER Jobim  ] also expressed interest in technology transfers , particularly as they could apply to [MISC Brazilian  ] plans to modernize its military . 
Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] acknowledged that we were aware of [MISC Brazilian  ] interest in [LOC U.S.  ] submarine technology and were preparing what we hoped would be a constructive response. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In a separate meeting with MOD Chief of Staff [PER Barboza  ] , DATT was told that the MOD 's response to the [LOC U.S.  ] was aimed at reaching consensus with the [ORG USG  ] that could gain President [PER Lula  ] 's support as a deliverable for [PER Jobim  ] 's visit to [LOC Washington  ] , circumventing [ORG MRE  ] obstruction . 
This was the tactic that led to completion of the [ORG SOFA  ] with [LOC France  ] earlier this year . 
[PER Barboza  ] indicated that the [MISC French  ] [ORG SOFA  ] used language that did not provoke constitutional onjections as previous proposals for [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] SOFAs have . 
He counselled observing the reaction of [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Congress  ] to the [MISC French  ] [ORG SOFA  ] ( and completing the [ORG DCA  ] ) before working on a [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] version . 
[PER Barboza  ] also expressed caution on the possible [ORG GSOMIA  ] , noting that no other information sharing arrangment to which [LOC Brazil  ] is a party would involve visits . 
He did , however , leave the door open to exploration of a formula that could work for both sides. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Jobim  ] told Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] that the [MISC Brazilian  ] government shared the Ambassador 's concern about the possibility of [LOC Venezuela  ] exporting instability . 
He believed that President [PER Chavez  ] has been saber rattling to distract from internal problems . 
[LOC Brazil  ] supports creation of a " [MISC South American Defense Council  ] " to bring [PER Chavez  ] into the mainstream of the continent and provide reassurance that there is no security threat . 
[PER Jobim  ] believed that isolating [LOC Venezuela  ] would lead to further posturing from [PER Chavez  ] and a greater risk of spreading instability among neighboring countries . 
4 . 
( C ) EMBASSY COMMENT: However impractical the suggestion may seem , it follows the traditional [MISC Brazilian  ] policy of trying to be everyone 's friend by attempting to incorporate [PER Chavez'  ] idea for defense cooperation into a supposed containment strategy .
