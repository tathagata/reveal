( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: On 16 October 2009 Principal Officer and consulate officers joined Rio State Secretary of Security [PER Beltrame  ] and police officials for a visit to [PER Dona Marta  ] , the first favela formally considered " pacified " under the state government 's [ORG Favela Pacification Program  ] ( ref b ) . 
Along with [PER Dona Marta  ] , four other favelas are considered pacified at present . 
Rio police entered the [PER Dona Marta  ] favela in December 2008 , pushing out drug gang members who had dominated the area , establishing community policing and introducing public utilities and other services into the community . 
[PER Dona Marta  ] now appears generally calm and secure , with a permanent Pacification Police Unit ( [ORG UPP  ] ) presence in place , but [PER Beltrame  ] said additional services and assistance to the favela 's population needed to consolidate gains are lagging . 
The experience with [PER Dona Marta  ] seems encouraging thus far , but also points up , per comment below , some lessons going forward: i.e. , that favelas will have distinctive characteristics that must be taken into account , that there is a pressing need for additional civilian agency and [ORG NGO  ] support for the [ORG FPP  ] , and that the momentum crucial for the [ORG FPP  ] 's success over time will require , in [PER Beltrame  ] 's own assessment , successful pacification of 30-40 favelas ( out of more than 1,000 in [LOC Rio  ] ) where gang dominance and violence are most severe . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On 16 October , one day before an outbreak of widespread drug gang violence in [LOC Rio  ] 's northern zone ( ref a ) , Principal Officer , accompanied by [ORG Rio State Security  ] Secretary [PER Jose Mariano Beltrame  ] and by state police and consulate officers , visited [PER Dona Marta  ] ( aka [PER Santa Marta  ] ) , the first [LOC Rio  ] favela to be formally considered " pacified " under the state government 's [ORG Favela Pacification Program  ] ( ref b ) . 
Four other favelas are currently considered pacified , i.e. , mostly free of gang activity and with the population accessible for city services and social assistance . 
Home to an estimated 15,000 persons , the [PER Dona Marta  ] favela climbs a steep hill directly above the [ORG Botafogo  ] area of the city 's affluent [ORG South Zone  ] . 
It is a maze of improvised brick and plywood dwellings , spread along twisting , narrow paths ( recently improved with concrete surfaces ) . 
The favela fits within a relatively compact space bordered by two walls that separate the favela from an ecological preserve . 
A funicular-type street car on a track runs along one side of the favela . 
The [PER Dona Marta  ] favela was occupied by authorities under the [ORG FPP  ] plan in December 2008 , and [PER Beltrame  ] explained that state authorities had followed closely the [ORG FPP  ] model in entering [PER Dona Marta  ] . 
( Comment . 
This approach is reminiscent of " clear , hold and build " in [LOC U.S.  ] counterinsurgency doctrine , as discused in ref b . 
End comment . 
) After [PER Beltrame  ] personally visited the favela to advise residents that the police " were coming in and coming to stay , " state military police , spearheaded by the [ORG Special Operations Battalion  ] ( [ORG BOPE  ] ) , entered [PER Dona Marta  ] in late 2008 , resulting in some confrontations ( accounts of the level of violence vary ) with local elements of the major [LOC Rio  ] drug gang [PER Commando Vermelho  ] ( [ORG Red Command  ] ) which controlled the area . 
Most gang members ultimately fled , and the gang leader who had ruled the favela for many years was arrested and transferred to a maximum security prison . 
His house - situated on commanding high ground in the favela - has been turned into a police observation post. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Within a month from the initial police invasion , [PER Dona Marta  ] was free of gang dominance , [PER Beltrame  ] said . 
State authorities established a Police Pacification Unit ( [ORG UPP  ] ) station in an abandoned crhche building at the summit of the favela , with 120 [ORG UPP  ] police officers full time ( 2x 12-hour shifts ) in the favela . 
The [ORG UPP  ] policemen are specially trained in the community policing techniques that , under the plan 's doctrine , are intended to win the trust of the local population and increase their access to civil services and governance ( ref b ) . 
Utilities companies brought regular electrical power and sanitary plumbing to the favela for the first time , and [PER Dona Marta  ] residents willingly paid the new utilities bills , since a documented history of paid city services can enable favela residents to claim legal title to the property on which their makeshift dwellings are built , [PER Beltrame  ] explained . 
[PER Beltrame  ] lamented , however , that other services and projects that needed to come into the favela quickly to consolidate hope for a better future within the population were not materializing rapidly enough . 
He stressed both civilian agencies in the state government and civil society groups needed to be more directly and broadly engaged in the [ORG FPP  ] ; " the police cannot do it all , " he added. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Walking through [PER Dona Marta  ] with [PER Beltrame  ] and the [ORG UPP  ] station commander , a female military police captain who appeared to be a beloved figure to many of the favela 's children , [ORG PO  ] noted a general sense of calm ( many favela residents were away at jobs during the weekday morning , and mainly children , young mothers and elderly persons were in evidence ) . 
Starting at the [ORG UPP  ] station , [ORG PO  ] saw police volunteers giving classes in karate to several children and adolescents from the community , and also coaching soccer on a field built by the police next to the station . 
In a grim reminder of life in [PER Dona Marta  ] before pacification , one wall of the former crhche-turned-UPP station was pockmarked with gun shots - [PER Beltrame  ] indicated it had been an execution site used by favela criminals . 
The [ORG UPP  ] station also had a small operations center , with TV screens showing images from surveillance cameras posted throughout the favela . 
[PER Beltrame  ] pointed out to [ORG PO  ] several spots where traffickers had controlled access throughout the favela , and indicating the choke points and gang fighting positions had been mapped out by police in advance of the invasion . 
A young boy from the neighborhood acted as guide to lead [ORG PO  ] and the group to a rough patio overlooking [LOC Rio  ] - a location that is [PER Dona Marta  ] 's claim to fame , the site of the filming of a famous [PER Michael Jackson  ] music video from the 1990s . 
[PER Beltrame  ] said that persistent rumor in the favela indicated [PER Jackson  ] 's production group paid local traffickers to assure security for the video 's production. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Near the base of [PER Dona Marta  ] , [PER Beltrame  ] and [ORG PO  ] waited for the funicular cable car that serves three stops along the favela 's steep incline . 
A large group of print and media reporters interviewed [ORG PO  ] and [PER Beltrame  ] , indicating the high degree of interest in the [ORG FPP  ] - and the way it is being perceived abroad - in the [LOC Rio  ] public . 
Leaving the favela and entering the first paved street at the foot of the [PER Dona Marta  ] hill in [ORG Botafogo  ] ( favela residents call the regular neighborhoods of the city " the asphalt " ) , [PER Beltrame  ] pointed out several snack stalls along the street that appeared to have closed down . 
He said those small businesses had catered to [LOC Rio  ] residents - many from the middle class - who had driven the street at night , seeking to buy cocaine from [PER Dona Marta  ] 's gang dealers . 
Those small-scale merchants had actually protested to police that the pacification of the favela had been bad for their business , adding their complaints , [PER Beltrame  ] mused , to others doubtless expressed by the drug gang 's customers , who had lost the " drive through " cocaine purchase venue afforded by [PER Dona Marta  ] 's proximity to [ORG Botafogo  ] 's busy streets . 
As [PER Beltrame  ] and [ORG PO  ] prepared to depart , the president of the favela residents association approached and told [PER Beltrame  ] that " things are going well " and , despite some " specific problems " ( [ORG NFI  ] ) , the community is optimistic and will continue to cooperate with authorities. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: [PER Dona Marta  ] is receiving a lot of attention as the test case for the [ORG FPP  ] , and a bellwether of whether this new strategic approach can actually create conditions for fundamentally altering [ORG Rio  ] 's abysmally violent environment for the better . 
That may be more scrutiny than the relatively small community spreading on a hill above [ORG Botafogo  ] can justify in terms of drawing clear and persuasive conclusions , but the experience of the [ORG FPP  ] in [PER Dona Marta  ] in its initial seems encouraging . 
The visit to the favela reinforced a number of observations on favelas and the [ORG FPP  ] approach: --Every favela will be distinctive: [PER Dona Marta  ] is the [ORG FPP  ] prototype , but its relatively small size , terrain features and other social aspects make it a somewhat easier proposition than many other favelas , such as the [ORG Morro  ] dos Maccacos , where the police helicopter was shot down ( ref a ) , or the massive [MISC Complexo  ] de [PER Alemao  ] , which is a veritable fortress of the senior leaders of the [MISC Commando Vermelho  ] . 
Successful pacification of [MISC Complexo  ] de [PER Alemao  ] will be iconic for the city 's effort to reclaim the favelas , but also likely will be " traumatic " in terms of the scale of violence , according to [PER Beltrame  ] ( ref b ) , perhaps resembling the battles in [LOC Fallujah  ] more than a conventional urban police operation . 
Other favelas will be nearly as hard . 
Political leaders will have to prepare Rio - and [LOC Brazil  ] - for that reality. --Police are not enough: The [ORG FPP  ] strategy contemplates police pushing traffickers out , securing favelas and winning their residents' confidence with the [ORG UPP  ] . 
However , it was never envisaged in the plan that police would also be the primary , long-term arbiters for provision of city services to residents , and main providers of volunteers for social action projects . 
Yet that is what is happening , according to [PER Beltrame  ] , as civilian government agencies and [ORG NGOs  ] have yet to fall in on the [ORG FPP  ] doctrine in any organized and robust fashion . 
In [PER Dona Marta  ] , with the exception of a few tutors and computer instructors who volunteered individually , police officers are doing everything from assisting residents with requests for utilities to coaching sports . 
There is no cadre of civilian government and NGO personnel to handle those tasks , nor evidence of systematic programming for additional services ( beyond basic light and water ) on the horizon . 
If such a vacuum persists , it will wear down police capacity and lead to frustration among residents in pacified favelas , threatening the initial gains in those areas. --Momentum is crucial: The past week in [LOC Rio  ] is an example of how events - especially sudden and violent ones - can derail best-laid plans for the [ORG FPP  ] 's progression . 
Whatever next steps were planned under the [ORG FPP  ] , the entire machinery of [LOC Rio  ] 's security structure was suddenly deployed in dragnet actions against favelas thought to house the leaders of the attack against the police helicopter , which captured national and world attention . 
The gunmen get a vote , and outlasting and besting them will require a combination of persistence and tactical patience - a willingness to adjust and even delay action at times -- while remaining committed to the strategic plan . 
[PER Beltrame  ] seems aware of this , and will also pick and chose his fights . 
[LOC Rio  ] has an estimated 1,000 favelas encompassing approximately 3 million people , but [PER Beltrame  ] cautiously believes he can achieve strong momentum if he can pacify between 30-40 favelas with the largest concentrations of criminal activity over the next two or so years. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While much of the current international attention on [LOC Rio  ] stems from the [ORG Rio  ] 's selection to host the [MISC Olympics  ] in 2016 and the recent spectacular violence that closely followed the [MISC Olympics  ] announcement , most [LOC Rio  ] residents see the issue in even more profound terms . 
As [ORG Rio Governor  ] [PER Sergio Cabral  ] noted recently , [LOC Brazil  ] has a track record for successfully securing major athletic events , but the greater challenge for [LOC Rio  ] is to create a permanent change in the city , addressing the favelas and the profound social problems they present with a comprehensive and sustained strategy that can fundamentally alter the security environment , economy and quality of the life in the city for the long term .
