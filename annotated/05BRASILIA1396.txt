04 [LOC BRASILIA  ] 633 D. STATE 86436 Classified By: [PER POLOFF  ] BISOLA OJIKUTU FOR REASONS 1.4 B AND D <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) On May 20 , [PER PolOff  ] delivered reftel and talking points to [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Ministry of External Relations  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) [ORG International Organizations Division  ] ( [ORG DOI  ] ) and the [ORG Human Rights Divisions  ] ( [ORG DDH  ] ) . 
[PER PolOff  ] also delivered reftel talking points to [ORG UNHCR  ] representative in [LOC Brasilia  ] [PER Luis Varese  ] . 
[PER PolOff  ] 's requests for a meeting with the [ORG Brazilian National Committee for Refugees  ] ( [ORG CONARE  ] ) were refused because [ORG CONARE  ] 's position has not changed since reftels A through [PER D.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Officials from [ORG DDH  ] , [ORG DOI  ] , and [ORG UNHCR  ] confirmed that the [ORG GOB  ] 's position regarding this issue has not changed since 2003 and will likely not change in the foreseeable future . 
The [ORG GOB  ] still contends that it cannot accept [MISC Guantanamo  ] migrants because it is illegal to designate someone not on [MISC Brazilian  ] soil a refugee . 
Despite multiple requests , [PER PolOff  ] did not receive a response regarding the [ORG USG  ] 's offer to pay for transportation for [ORG GOB  ] resettlement officials to travel to [LOC Guantanamo  ] . 
( Comment: Based upon [MISC Brazilian  ] legislation and [ORG CONARE  ] 's strong stance against the [ORG USG  ] 's proposal , [PER PolOff  ] does not believe that the [ORG GOB  ] will accept this arrangement . 
End Comment ) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG DDH Office  ] Director [PER Marcia Ramos  ] told [PER PolOff  ] that the [ORG GOB  ] 's close relationship with the [MISC Cuban  ] government would make it impossible for the [ORG GOB  ] to accept [MISC Cuban  ] refugees . 
When [PER PolOff  ] asked if the [ORG GOB  ] would consider accepting [MISC Haitian  ] migrants only , [PER Ramos  ] said that due to [MISC Brazilian  ] legislation , the [ORG GOB  ] could not accept any migrants from [LOC Guantanamo Bay.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG UNHCR  ] representative [PER Luis Varese  ] was more forthcoming in providing concrete answers to explain the [ORG GOB  ] 's position . 
( [PER Note: Varese  ] is a [ORG CONARE  ] member and has one vote on the board . 
End note . 
) [PER Varese  ] told [PER PolOff  ] that refugee status in [LOC Brazil  ] is usually granted after the refugee has been recognized by the host country ( in this case , the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) . 
According to [PER Varese  ] , the [ORG GOB  ] and [ORG CONARE  ] believe that the migrants at [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] do not fit into this category because the [ORG USG  ] has not " formally recognized " them as refugees . 
If they were formally recognized , [ORG CONARE  ] believes , the [ORG USG  ] would allow them to resettle in the [LOC U.S.  ] so resettlement would not be an issue . 
[PER Varese  ] told [PER PolOff  ] that the " formal recognition " issue caused the [ORG GOB  ] to reject the [ORG USG  ] 's proposal in 2003 . 
He also told [PER PolOff  ] that [ORG CONARE  ] 's position would " probably not change " in the future . 
Comment ------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) All attempts to discuss this issue with [ORG GOB  ] and [ORG CONARE  ] officials were flatly refused or accepted begrudgingly . 
In addition , this issue has been raised on numerous occasions and at a variety of levels , including [PER U/S Grossman  ] , since 2003 . 
Given [MISC Brazilian  ] legislation and [PER Varese  ] 's comments , it does not appear that [ORG CONARE  ] or the [ORG GOB  ] will change their position on this issue .
