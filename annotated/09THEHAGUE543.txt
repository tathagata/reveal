THE [ORG HAGUE  ] 419 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Daalder  ] for reasons 1.5 ( b , d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: [ORG U.S. Permanent Representative  ] to [ORG NATO  ] , Ambassador [PER Ivo Daalder  ] , argued for the extension of the [LOC Netherlands  ] , military deployment and aid to [LOC Afghanistan  ] beyond 2010 during high-level meetings , a speech , press interviews , and a reception in The [ORG Hague  ] on September 3 , <a id='par2009' href='#par2009'>¶</a>2009 . 
This cable covers conversations with Development Minister [PER Koenders  ] ( paragraphs 2 - 8 ) , FM [PER Verhagen  ] ( paragraphs 9 - 13 ) , and senior foreign policy officials ( paragraphs 14 - 24 ) . 
[MISC Dutch  ] officials uniformly responded that selling an extended military deployment to the [MISC Dutch  ] parliament will be difficult , but that some [MISC Dutch  ] involvement in [LOC Afghanistan  ] past 2010 is almost certain . 
[PER Daalder  ] also exchanged views with the [MISC Dutch  ] on the [ORG NATO  ] strategic concept ( paragraphs 13 , 24 ) . 
Paragraph 25 summarizes [MISC Dutch  ] participation and reactions at the speech and reception . 
END SUMMARY. ----------------------------- Development Minister [PER Koenders  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) September 3 , 2009 ; [MISC Dutch  ] Foreign Ministry ; The [ORG Hague  ] , [LOC Netherlands.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Participants: [LOC United States  ] ------------- Ambassador [PER Hartog Levin Ambassador Daalder Jennifer Davis  ] , [ORG U.S. Mission  ] to [ORG NATO  ] Eric Falls , [ORG Embassy The Hague Netherlands  ] ----------- [PER Bert Koenders  ] , Minister for [ORG Development Cooperation Ms.  ] [PER Joke Brandt  ] , [ORG MFA DG for Development Cooperation Ms.  ] Godie van [PER de Paal  ] , [ORG MFA Task Force Uruzgan  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( SBU ) Ambassador [PER Daalder  ] emphasized President [PER Obama  ] , s commitment to success in [LOC Afghanistan  ] through cooperative effort with Allies . 
The new [LOC U.S.  ] strategy has two key themes , he said . 
First , it is more narrowly defined to ensure it is tied to our core interests and to ensure it is achievable . 
Second , the [LOC U.S.  ] is boosting support for the strategy through regional cooperation , the &3D8 approach of defense , diplomacy , and development , and through rapid build-up of [MISC Afghan  ] security forces . 
[PER Daalder  ] also emphasized our mission in [LOC Afghanistan  ] is a combined effort -- forty percent of the troops in [LOC ISAF  ] , as well as forty percent of our casualties , are from our non-U.S . 
Allies. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Daalder  ] explained that we hope the [MISC Dutch  ] will stay in [LOC Afghanistan  ] as we value their expertise . 
He added that we understand that the number of [MISC Dutch  ] troops may decline after 2010 . 
Nonetheless , he said we believe there are two key messages that may help convince the [MISC Dutch  ] public and parliament to support an extension of the [MISC Dutch  ] mission . 
First , the new [LOC U.S.  ] president is extremely popular in [LOC Europe  ] and that popularity might result in deeper support for the mission in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Second , the [LOC United States  ] depends on cooperation of important Allies like the [LOC Netherlands  ] , which has taken a real leadership role in development efforts and relationship-building in [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Koenders  ] responded with a review of previous [MISC Dutch  ] decisions on [LOC Afghanistan  ] and an explanation of the current political situation . 
The first [MISC Dutch  ] deployment was a Qpolitical situation . 
The first [MISC Dutch  ] deployment was a &sensitive8 decision for the [ORG Labor  ] party four years ago . 
( Background: [PER Koenders  ] is from the [ORG Labor  ] party . 
The [LOC Netherlands  ] , current governing coalition includes the [MISC Christian Democrats  ] , the [ORG Christian Union  ] , and the [ORG Labor  ] party , which is the most skeptical member of the coalition regarding [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
See reftel A , [PER B. End Background  ] . 
) &I supported the decision , but it was difficult , 8 he said . 
THE [ORG HAGUE  ] 00000543 002 OF 005 The [ORG Labor  ] party required a development component to the mission , the &soft approach , 8 though he &didn , t think it was soft , 8 and he knew troops &would be killed.8 After intensive parliamentary discussions , the party agreed to a two-year deployment , until 2008 . 
The decision to extend the deployment until 2010 was also difficult , with [ORG Labor  ] and other parties expressing significant concerns about burden-sharing . 
The [ORG Labor Party  ] was &unhappy8 with the final decision. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Looking ahead , [PER Koenders  ] said the [MISC Dutch  ] would continue development efforts in [LOC Uruzgan  ] -- the [MISC Dutch  ] leadership is civilian and the [MISC Dutch  ] have been successful . 
However , the government , s credibility is at stake with any military redeployment . 
The government will decide whether the military will &leave completely8 or &just leave Uruzgan.8 To make the case to the [ORG Labor  ] party , the [MISC Dutch  ] parliament , and the [MISC Dutch  ] people , [PER Koenders  ] said it would be helpful to show greater burden sharing and more collaboration on development aid . 
President [PER Obama  ] and the new [ORG U.S. Afghanistan  ] strategy are also helpful elements , he added. &The picture has changed completely.8 In addition , there should be &no mission creep for [MISC ISAF8  ] and [ORG UNAMA  ] needs a larger role . 
On selling the new strategy , [PER Koenders  ] said the [MISC Dutch  ] people would need to see some element of success and a realistic strategy with a final goal that we can achieve . 
[PER Koenders  ] wondered whether it made sense for the [LOC Netherlands  ] to lead on aid coordination , given its &small8 contributions relative to the [LOC United States  ] . 
However , he said it would be worthwhile to follow up on his good discussions with the previous USAID director , particularly on the disorganized effort in [LOC Pakistan.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Daalder  ] said that President [PER Obama  ] agrees we need to establish a realistic exit goal by shifting security to [LOC Afghanistan  ] itself and show some real progress on the ground within 12-18 months in order to sustain political support . 
He added we will work on follow-on meetings about development cooperation. ----------- FM [PER Verhagen  ] ----------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) September 3 , 2009 ; [MISC Dutch  ] Foreign Ministry ; The [LOC Hague  ] , [LOC Netherlands.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) Participants: [LOC United States  ] ------------- Ambassador [PER Hartog Levin Ambassador Daalder Jennifer Davis  ] , [ORG U.S. Mission  ] to [ORG NATO  ] Eric Falls , [ORG Embassy The Hague Netherlands  ] ----------- [PER Maxime Verhagen  ] , Foreign Minister Mr. [PER Marcel De Vink  ] , Private Secretary to the Minister Mr. [PER Maarten Boef  ] , Head of [ORG MFA Task Force Uruzgan  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Daalder  ] emphasized the importance of the [LOC Netherlands  ] , decision on [MISC Afghanistan:  ] if the [LOC Netherlands  ] pulls out , he said , we will not be able to convince [LOC Canada  ] to reverse its withdrawal decision and we could then lose the [LOC UK  ] in a &domino effect.8 The [ORG USG  ] wants to help the [MISC Dutch  ] government support an extension of [MISC Dutch  ] troops , although [PER Daalder  ] said &we won , t tell you what to do , 8 knowing that public pressure from the [LOC U.S.  ] would be self-defeating . 
[PER Daalder  ] added we understand the [MISC Dutch  ] must withdraw as &lead nation8 in [LOC Uruzgan  ] , although with the new [MISC ISAF  ] command Qnation8 in [LOC Uruzgan  ] , although with the new [MISC ISAF  ] command structure that is less relevant . 
He said the [LOC United States  ] hopes the [MISC Dutch  ] will maintain troops in the &four figure8 level , including enablers , [MISC F-16s  ] , and medical units , adding that lower profile deployments might be helpful in making the case to the public . 
In addition , he said we are making the shift from a direct security role to partnering with the [ORG Afghan National Army  ] ( [ORG ANA  ] ) . 
President [PER Obama  ] , s popularity THE [ORG HAGUE  ] 00000543 003 OF 005 and our new strategy are also key arguments. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Verhagen  ] responded , &I am ready to defend a new decision8 on the [LOC Netherlands  ] , troop deployment , given the new situation in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , the new [LOC U.S.  ] president , the new [LOC U.S.  ] strategy in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , broader participation by Allies , and the [LOC Netherlands  ] , involvement at the G20 . 
However , he said , these arguments are not sufficient . 
[PER Verhagen  ] said the [MISC Dutch  ] government won the vote in parliament by setting a 2010 timetable for pull-out , and needed to show reduced corruption in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , better coordination of aid , and a greater role for [MISC German  ] and [MISC French  ] troops . 
Greater contributions from Allies like [LOC France  ] and [LOC Germany  ] are key for winning votes from the [MISC Liberal  ] party ( [ORG VVD  ] ) , he explained . 
[PER Verhagen  ] emphasized that the [LOC United States  ] should &invest in the [LOC VVD8  ] and [ORG VVD  ] leaders such as [PER Mark Rutte  ] . 
The most recent meeting with [ORG VVD  ] leaders regarding [LOC Uruzgan  ] &was not positive.8 ( Background: The [ORG VVD  ] , or [MISC Liberal  ] party , is in the opposition but nonetheless considered essential in supporting an extension , as [MISC Dutch  ] governments need to win support of a broad coalition for military deployments . 
End background . 
) <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( S ) [PER Daalder  ] concluded with a review of upcoming discussions on [ORG NATO  ] , s &strategic concept , 8 being headed by former Secretary of State [PER Albright  ] . 
The group of experts should discuss all issues responsibly , he said ; in the past some Allies have hesitated to work on difficult issues . 
[PER Verhagen  ] welcomed [PER Daalder  ] , s suggestion , noting that a discussion of [ORG Article  ] 5 and &out of area8 initiatives would be key . 
[PER Verhagen  ] said he supports the [MISC German  ] proposal to include disarmament efforts as part of the discussion and said he has blocked internal [MISC Dutch  ] discussions on the presence of nuclear weapons in the [LOC Netherlands  ] because that is a matter for [ORG NATO  ] to consider . 
However , [PER Verhagen  ] said the [LOC Netherlands  ] is open to frank [ORG NATO  ] discussions and is sending a delegation to [LOC Washington  ] to discuss nuclear posture ( [ORG Note: MOD Policy  ] Director General [PER Lo Casteleijn  ] will lead the delegation on September 9 . 
End note . 
) [PER Daalder  ] thanked [PER Verhagen  ] and emphasized that Allied agreements on nuclear weapons in [LOC Europe  ] would be indispensable to good transatlantic relations and should include the &Quad , 8 weapons-basing countries , and [LOC Lithuania  ] , amongst others. --------------------------------- Lunch with Senior [MISC Dutch  ] Officials --------------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 .

( C ) Over lunch , [PER Daalder  ] met with the &Triad8 -- the leading [MISC Dutch  ] civilian advisers to the Prime Minister , Foreign Minister , and Minister of [LOC Defense  ] -- to emphasize the importance of [MISC Dutch  ] contributions in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Daalder  ] emphasized key points from his discussions with [PER Verhagen  ] and [PER Koenders  ] ( paras 4 , 5 , and 11 above ) . 
THE [ORG HAGUE  ] 00000543 004 OF 005 <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [ORG MFA Political Director  ] [PER De Gooijer  ] said [LOC Afghanistan  ] is the &most pressing issue8 for the [ORG Triad  ] and added &our job is to help our bosses8 -- six ministers -- make a decision . 
( [ORG Note:  ] The six key ministers are PM [MISC Balkenende  ] , Deputy PM and Finance Minister Bos , Deputy PM and Minister of [LOC Youth  ] and [ORG Family Affairs  ] Rouvoet , Foreign Minister [PER Verhagen  ] , Defense Minister [PER Van Middelkoop  ] , and Development Minister [PER Koenders  ] . 
End note . 
) [PER De Gooijer  ] explained that [MISC Dutch  ] leaders are heavily influenced by a clear [LOC Afghanistan  ] strategy as well as prospects for success , as well as [MISC Dutch  ] domestic politics . 
He said the [MISC Dutch  ] appreciated [LOC U.S.  ] sensitivity in letting the [MISC Dutch  ] make its &own decision.8 In addition , he noted the [MISC Dutch  ] were in a different stage of the decision-making process than the [LOC United States:  ] &You have rolled out a new strategy , while we are considering a redeployment ; you are engaging in a surge , while we are looking to pull back . 
We need to bridge this concept . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] press will also want to know how these results benefit the [LOC Netherlands  ] , 8 he said. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) Mr. [PER Van Oosterom  ] , the [ORG National Security Adviser  ] equivalent , welcomed President [PER Obama  ] , s remarks on [LOC Afghanistan  ] and emphasized that the [LOC United States  ] should avoid public pressure on the [MISC Dutch  ] . 
He said while [MISC Dutch  ] government officials would like to see a quick decision on a new [MISC Dutch  ] deployment , the decision process would be complex. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) [ORG MOD Policy  ] Director [PER Casteleijn  ] noted there is tremendous [MISC Dutch  ] enthusiasm for President [PER Obama  ] . 
He encouraged continued emphasis on development aid and a &broad concept8 for the [LOC Afghanistan  ] strategy . 
He suggested avoiding &NATO-ization8 of the [LOC Afghanistan  ] mission through greater involvement by the [ORG EU  ] , [ORG UN  ] , and other international organizations . 
Waiting 18 months for good results will be risky for the [MISC Dutch  ] , he added , given that some [MISC Dutch  ] government officials are trying now to extend the deployment for two years . 
He also noted there is a perception in the [LOC Netherlands  ] that the [MISC Dutch  ] have done &their fair share.8 He said promoting greater contributions from some Allies who haven , t &punched in their weight class8 would be important to demonstrate. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) Lt. General [PER Meulman  ] said the [MISC Dutch  ] military had the capacity to support an extension beyond 2010 , although it would be difficult to continue at the same level -- 1,800 troops in [LOC Afghanistan  ] -- and it would be difficult to leave some elements like several helicopters for much longer . 
[PER Meulman  ] also urged better coordination among [LOC ISAF  ] , the [ORG UN  ] , and the [MISC GOA.  ] <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) [ORG MFA Deputy Political  ] Director [PER De Groot  ] added there is significant mixing of strategies , such as counterinsurgency and development . 
At the same time , he said we have seen disappointing results in state-building and need an overarching development strategy as well as a new [LOC Afghanistan  ] Compact in 2010. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) [PER Daalder  ] noted President [PER Obama  ] , s strong support for metrics to show results on the ground . 
He added that [PER McChrystal  ] , s forthcoming assessment of troops-to-task in [LOC QMcChrystal  ] , s forthcoming assessment of troops-to-task in [LOC Afghanistan  ] may provide the [MISC Dutch  ] government with a clearer picture of the way forward and improve civilian and military coordination . 
He said the [LOC Netherlands  ] and [LOC Canada  ] have been the most thoughtful of the Allies on a comprehensive approach in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , so it would be particularly damaging if they leave the coalition. <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( C ) ( Note: In a private discussion after lunch , [PER De Gooijer  ] encouraged [PER Daalder  ] to ask Secretary [PER Geithner  ] to tell Finance Minister Bos that the [LOC Netherlands  ] would not have a seat in G20 discussions but for its contributions in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Bos is head of the [ORG Labor  ] party and key to the [MISC Dutch  ] cabinet , s decision on [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( reftel A , B ) . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( C ) On [ORG NATO  ] generally , [PER Daalder  ] thanked [PER De Gooijer  ] for the choice of former [MISC Dutch  ] Shell CEO [PER Jeroen van der Veer  ] as Vice THE [ORG HAGUE  ] 00000543 005 OF 005 Chair of Secretary [PER Albright  ] , s [ORG NATO Strategic Concept  ] group of experts . 
[PER Van  ] der [PER Veer  ] will bring &a breath of fresh air , 8 he said , to the discussion . 
[PER Daalder  ] added the group should address everything , including points of strong disagreement like nuclear weapons , Articles 4 , 5 , and 10 of the [ORG NATO Treaty  ] , and [LOC Russia  ] . 
On [MISC NATO-EU  ] cooperation , [PER Daalder  ] said it was likely not productive to castigate [LOC Turkey  ] and [LOC Greece  ] as the new SYG had recently done . 
He suggested that to improve cooperation , [ORG NATO  ] and the [ORG EU  ] should consider regular , informal meetings to focus the &transatlantic8 discussion and that [LOC Sweden  ] , s [PER FM Bildt  ] could help in this role . 
[PER De Gooijer  ] said [PER FM Bildt  ] could certainly help bring [LOC Sweden  ] into [ORG NATO  ] , and any successor to [PER Solana  ] should commit to addressing [MISC NATO-EU  ] cooperation . 
[PER Daalder  ] flagged [LOC Finland  ] , s joining [ORG NATO  ] as a future point of contention with [LOC Russia.  ] ----------------- Speech , Reception ----------------- <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Daalder  ] spoke to a full house at the [ORG Societeit  ] [PER De Witte  ] on the afternoon of September 3 . 
More than 150 members of parliament , journalists , diplomats , academics , and students attended . 
Responding to questions for a half hour , [PER Daalder  ] explained the new [LOC U.S.  ] strategy and priorities in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
In one question , former [MISC Dutch  ] Chief of Defense Berlijn urged the [LOC United States  ] to pressure the government of [LOC Afghanistan  ] to improve its performance and reduce corruption . 
The new [MISC Dutch  ] representative to [ORG NATO  ] , Ambassador Majoor , urged a more integrated approach by [ORG NATO  ] to support development and diplomacy . 
On the evening of September 3 , at a well-attended reception hosted by Ambassador [PER Levin  ] , [PER Daalder  ] also engaged a similar audience , including the leading foreign policy or defense spokespersons for the major political parties in parliament .
