Reason: 1.4 ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary . 
[ORG Medvedev’s  ] address to the [ORG Federal Assembly  ] last week provided a prism for viewing the power relationship in the [MISC Medvedev-Putin  ] tandem , refracting opinion amongst our contacts into three , very divergent , camps . 
The first group views [PER Medvedev  ] as ascendant , slowly accruing power as he plays to his strengths managing the economic crisis . 
The second , more skeptical , group argues that [PER Medvedev  ] continues to play [PER Robin  ] to [ORG Putin’s Batman  ] , surrounded by a team loyal to the Premier and checked by [ORG Putin’s  ] dominance over the legislature and regional elites . 
Adherents to the third group see no essential difference between [PER Putin  ] and [PER Medvedev  ] , taking at face value the tandem’s unanimity in purpose and vision . 
All are hindered by the impenetrable nature of [LOC Kremlin  ] politics and the fertile field of speculation and rumor that the information vacuum creates . 
[ORG Putin’s  ] address to [LOC United Russia  ] on November 20 , which will be televised on [ORG Channel  ] 1 , could provide an opportunity to make a more definitive judgement on the balance of forces within the tandem . 
End Summary . 
[ORG Medvedev’s  ] Fans --------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG Medvedev’s  ] public bravura as the “commander-in-chief” during the [LOC Georgia  ] war and his proactive approach to the darkening economic picture have led some of our contacts to see the president coming into his own in recent months . 
[PER Aleksey Mukhin  ] , the director of the [ORG Center for Political Information  ] , told us that [ORG Medvedev’s  ] address demonstrated how far the president has come , learning from his predecessor the art of balancing the contradictory elite impulses and interests . 
[PER Mukhin  ] was not surprised by the strong language directed at the [LOC U.S.  ] , since [ORG Medvedev’s  ] rhetoric has toughened since August . 
Yet , [PER Mukhin  ] saw the aggressive language primarily as a sop to [PER Putin  ] and the hard-liners before [PER Medvedev  ] moved on to his reform agenda . 
Extending the presidential term will provide [PER Medvedev  ] the possibility of 10 years in power -- enough time for him ( or his successor ) to implement lasting reform . 
[PER Mukhin  ] explained that the main thrust of the political reforms is to compel regional leaders to establish closer contact with local assemblies and with voters . 
He sees this as a first step in [ORG Medvedev’s  ] plan to build his own constituency within [LOC United Russia  ] and the regional elite as the basis for a re-election run in 2012. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Mark Urnov  ] of the Higher School of Economics viewed [PER Putin  ] as the principal decision maker , but one who is under increasing pressure owing to the financial crisis . 
[PER Urnov  ] largely dismissed [ORG Medvedev’s  ] address as a “PR effort” to demonstrate to a domestic audience that he could deliver a strong speech on foreign policy and security issues . 
Like [PER Mukhin  ] , [PER Urnov  ] argued that the elements of political reform bear closer examination as [ORG Medvedev’s  ] first steps in creating his own team . 
The president’s anti-corruption agenda provided a signal to the elite that he has the will and power to target their economic interests . 
[PER Urnov  ] expects him to use this selectively to begin to remove people in ministries ( deputy ministers and above ) as well as some regional leaders and to replace them with “his people.” <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Urnov  ] told us that [ORG Medvedev’s  ] tough rhetoric toward the [LOC U.S.  ] was dictated equally by his poor standing in the eyes of the military and by the inability of [PER Putin  ] and his closest advisors to deal with the stresses of the economic downturn . 
As for the former , [PER Urnov  ] said that recent surveys of military officers -- which are being kept quiet -- indicate the absolute abysmal regard with which the military holds [PER Medvedev  ] . 
Promises of increased funding will have to be scaled back , leaving [PER Medvedev  ] to turn to words about the importance of the military in protecting [MISC Russian  ] interests and belittling the [LOC U.S.  ] as acting irresponsibly . 
On the second point , [PER Putin  ] ( and indirectly [PER Medvedev  ] ) do not understand how to function politically in an economic crisis . 
They understand how to exploit the good times to their advantage , but not how to lead and survive in the bad . 
[PER Urnov  ] noted that rhetoric is only going to get them so far , especially now after the [LOC U.S.  ] elections as the [PER Obama  ] victory and a change of administrations makes it much harder for them to put blame on [LOC Washington  ] for [MISC Russia’s  ] travails . 
[ORG Putin’s  ] the [ORG Man  ] --------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Other contacts are less generous toward [PER Medvedev  ] , considering him an instrument of [ORG Putin’s  ] power rather than an independent player . 
A review of [ORG Medvedev’s  ] address by the business paper [LOC Vedemosti  ] argued that many of the proposed “liberal reforms , ” such as having the majority party recommend gubernatorial candidates and making the government answerable to the [ORG Duma  ] on some issues , would strengthen the [LOC Putin-led United Russia  ] -- indicating that his agenda continues to shape the tandem policy line . 
Likewise , press reporting pointed out that the other proposals , such as giving 1-2 seats to minority parties that garner 5-7 percent of the vote and measures to ease the registration of parties , would have made no difference in the past election and are unlikely to signal a broadening of political pluralism . 
In short , those analysts saw [ORG Medvedev’s  ] reform agenda strengthening [PER Putin  ] and his position , despite the democratic rhetoric in the address. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] cited the [MISC Stalinist  ] credo “cadres decide everything” as justification for dismissing [PER Medvedev  ] as a real contender ( indeed , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] sees the president as the number 3 guy , behind [PER Putin  ] and Deputy Premier [PER Igor Sechin  ] ) . 
In his formulation , [PER Putin  ] remains the main arbiter of elite conflict and continues to balance the two , unequal factions against each other . 
For opposition leader [PER Boris Nemtsov  ] , whose [ORG SPS  ] party was bought out by the [LOC Kremlin  ] , [PER Medvedev  ] remains the [MISC Lilliputian  ] to [ORG Putin’s  ] commander-in-chief . 
Insecurity and lack of legitimacy would drive a Putinesque policy , but [PER Nemtsov  ] stressed that it was [PER Putin  ] who pulled all the strings . 
Two Peas in a Pod ----------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Other contacts commented that a search for evidence of dissonance between the two leaders is either the forlorn hope of [MISC Western-leaning  ] liberals for a political thaw or a legacy of “Kremlinology” that presupposes inter-leadership conflict as the sine qua non of [MISC Russian  ] politics . 
Perhaps more important , they point to the unity of message between [PER Putin  ] and [PER Medvedev  ] on the most important issues: the revival of [MISC Russia’s  ] role as a great power , the need for combating corruption within the system , and the goal of improving the quality of life for everyday [MISC Russians  ] . 
[LOC U.S.  ] resident , but [MISC United Russia-connected  ] analyst [PER Nikolay Zlobin  ] concluded to us that the “tandem works.” No one outside [PER Medvedev  ] and [PER Putin  ] were privy to the codicils of this political arrangement , but the lack of transparency , he maintained , did not mean a lack of political efficiency. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Tatyana Stanovaya  ] of the [ORG Center for Political Technologies  ] is representative of the “tandem as team” camp and sees little reason to read the tea leaves for signs of a split . 
She pointed to [ORG Medvedev’s  ] address as the contradictory medley of a “Putin line” seeking to strengthen the state and a “Medvedev” impulse to scale back state involvement . 
Both the [LOC Kremlin  ] and the [LOC White House  ] approved the message , and the final product reflected coordination and compromise between the two leaders . 
[PER Stanovaya  ] underscored that those aspects attributed to [PER Putin  ] , particularly the proposal to extend the presidential term to 6 years , will have an immediate impact , while those considered more “Medvedian” -- lowering the barriers for smaller parties , for example -- will only have significance further down the road . 
Perhaps most important , [PER Stanovaya  ] emphasized that all of the elements of the address , like all other aspects of policy , enjoyed at least some support from both sides of the tandem , or they would not have been introduced . 
Constitutional Changes ---------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The most controversial moment of [ORG Medvedev’s  ] address was his proposal to extend the presidential term to 6 years , and that for [ORG Duma  ] members to 5 years . 
The press was , and remains , rife with rumors that the constitutional change is designed to create the conditions for a [PER Putin  ] return to the presidency , either by [ORG Medvedev’s  ] resignation or through a snap election , brought about by the change itself . 
Other rumors , including comments by [MISC Communist  ] party leader [PER Zyuganov  ] consider the proposed amendment to be a “graceful” way for [PER Putin  ] to leave his post as Premier , before the economy collapses , requiring a new round of [ORG Duma  ] elections and the resultant dismissal of the current government . 
The haste in which the administration is moving forward -- the [ORG Duma  ] may accomplish the required three readings and vote its approval by November 21 , and there are no apparent obstacles to having regional parliaments ratify the change -- has served to heighten speculation about the reasons behind what would be the first amendment to the 15-year old constitution. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Most of our contacts saw the term limit issue in terms of the tandem’s longer-term agenda , rather than a short-term plan to shake up the leadership . 
[PER Stanovaya  ] reminded us that [PER Putin  ] had raised the idea of extending term limits when he was president , but he did not want to lose face with the [LOC West  ] or his own society by adapting the constitution . 
Now that [ORG Putin’s  ] successor has come to power , she argued , the time has come to make the changes . 
[PER Urnov  ] sees the pressures of the looming economic crisis driving the timing of [ORG Medvedev’s  ] proposal . 
He noted that the constitutional change did not need to be included in [ORG Medvedev’s  ] address -- indeed , initial drafts did not include it . 
The decision to go forward now was dictated completely by politics: [PER Putin  ] and [PER Medvedev  ] see that their approval ratings dropping somewhat , and they fear how far they might go . 
[PER Urnov  ] believes that the tandem decided that is better to use whatever political momentum they still have due to the [LOC Georgia  ] conflict to push through the constitutional change now. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Few of our contacts gave any credit to rumors about [PER Putin  ] leaving his office . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] quipped that “Putin is not [MISC Ghandi  ] -- having succeeded in achieving major political goals , he would not be content to become the spiritual leader of his party.” [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that [PER Putin  ] knows he will expose his loyal team to risk , including removal from power , loss of fortune , and even imprisonment if he were to leave the scene . 
[PER Mukhin  ] also dismissed rumors about a possible [PER Putin  ] resignation , which would represent the abandonment of all that he has built up to this point . 
He argued that [PER Putin  ] recognizes that his resignation would signal a real clash between the elite clans and likely lead to political , economic , and even social instability . 
Moreover , there are plenty of scapegoats for [PER Putin  ] to blame if the economic downturn deepens substantially . 
[PER Zlobin  ] , however , saw the constitutional amendments strengthening the party’s oversight of the governors as a preliminary step for preparing [ORG Putin’s  ] shift to head United [LOC Russia  ] on a daily basis , without the responsibility for managing a sinking economy . 
Where You Sit is Where You Stand -------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Broadly speaking , analysis of the tandem reflects the political orientation of the analyst . 
As noted in earlier reporting , our contacts from the “liberal democratic” camp are dismissive of any proposals from the tandem government , seeing the proposals as further undermining the structure of [MISC Russian  ] democracy ( Reftel ) . “Establishment liberals , ” like [PER Mukhin  ] and [PER Urnov  ] , are inclined to place greater emphasis on ideas , looking at [ORG Medvedev’s  ] progressive rhetoric as a sign of possible change and ultimately a growing challenge to [ORG Putin’s  ] statist inclinations . 
Less ideological analysts focus more on systematic factors and tend emphasize [ORG Putin’s  ] overwhelming advantage in public opinion , control over cadres policy , and standing as United [LOC Russia  ] head as largely precluding a [PER Medvedev  ] ascension . 
Indeed , these “systemic” analysts downplay competition within the tandem as contradicting the very framework of the power arrangement. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) The opacity of [LOC Kremlin  ] politics and the conspiratorial leanings of [MISC Russia’s  ] political commentary have created fertile ground for a wide range of speculation and have impaired the emergence of a more broad-based consensus on the tandem’s future course . 
Deeping economic troubles , however , are certain to challenge the tandem and could create new pressures on the unity of leadership . 
[ORG Putin’s  ] speech to United [MISC Russia’s  ] conference on November 20 -- which in an unprecedented display of the strengthened stature of the Premier’s position will be televised to the nation -- provides an opportunity to analyze the differences between , or perhaps unaminity among , the two leaders . 
We will be watching closely to see if [PER Putin  ] uses the public rostrum to paint a different picture of events or to demonstrate a competing agenda to that outlined in [ORG Medvedev’s  ] address and will follow up with additional reporting .
