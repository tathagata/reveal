( C ) SUMMARY: [LOC Germany  ] continues to regard proposed [ORG NATO  ] contingency planning to defend the [ORG Balts  ] against possible [MISC Russian  ] aggression as counterproductive and unnecessary , but it has gone out of its way in recent months to take other measures to reassure the [ORG Balts  ] that it takes their security concerns seriously . 
[LOC Germany  ] has again volunteered to head the [ORG NATO  ] [MISC Baltic  ] [ORG Air Policing Mission  ] , and Defense Minister [PER Jung  ] made an unprecedented trip to all three countries in early June . 
The [MISC German  ] [ORG MFA  ] and [ORG MOD  ] hope these and other measures will assuage [MISC Baltic  ] fears sufficiently to allow [MISC German  ] initiatives in drawing [LOC Russia  ] closer to [ORG NATO  ] to go forward . 
The [ORG MFA  ] sees an opportunity to deepen security cooperation , even on missile defense given increased [MISC Russian  ] concern regarding [LOC Iran  ] . 
Overall , [LOC Germany  ] recognizes that working with [LOC Russia  ] is difficult , but hopes that [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to improve relations along with increased [MISC NATO-Russian  ] cooperation will move [LOC Russia  ] further along the path to becoming a reliable international partner . 
END SUMMARY . 
REACHING OUT <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) While the [ORG MFA  ] and [ORG MOD  ] offices responsible for the [MISC Baltic  ] countries and [ORG NATO  ] do not characterize it as such , [LOC Germany  ] appears to have undertaken a deliberate effort in recent months to demonstrate to the [ORG Balts  ] that it takes their security concerns seriously . 
It has volunteered again to head the [ORG NATO  ] [MISC Baltic  ] [ORG Air Policing Mission  ] , beginning August 31 , which involves the deployment of four fighter aircraft to [LOC Lithuania  ] . 
Everyone recognizes that the aircraft themselves could do little against a [MISC Russian  ] attack , but [LOC Germany  ] hopes the [ORG Balts  ] see them as a symbol of [MISC German  ] ( and [ORG NATO  ] ) commitment to [ORG Article  ] 5 . 
Given the extreme economic troubles in the [ORG Balts  ] , the [MISC German  ] [ORG MOD  ] expects this commitment to last several more years , as the countries are unlikely to be able to afford their own aircraft anytime soon. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Another indication of [MISC German  ] efforts to build bridges to the [ORG Balts  ] was Defense Minister [PER Jung  ] 's unprecedented trip to all three countries in early June to discuss how to increase security cooperation . 
During the four-day trip , [PER Jung  ] not only met his counterparts , but with the presidents of all three countries as well . 
For the most part , the visit was about building upon an already robust relationship , which has included [MISC German  ] training and exchange programs for hundreds of [MISC Baltic  ] troops in recent years . 
THE WORRIES AND HOPES <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Although [ORG MFA  ] Head of [ORG Northern Europe Division  ] [PER Thomas Terstegen  ] argues that the [MISC Baltic  ] states are less concerned about [MISC Russian  ] aggression than they were last fall in the immediate aftermath of the war in [LOC Georgia  ] , contacts recognize that the fundamental apprehension regarding [LOC Russia  ] will not disappear soon . 
[ORG MFA  ] Deputy Head of [ORG NATO Division  ] [PER Gunnar Denecke  ] wondered whether the July 16 open letter to the [LOC U.S.  ] signed by former [MISC Central  ] and [MISC Eastern European  ] leaders -- along with [MISC Swedish  ] Defense Minister Tolgfors July 3 comments regarding the [ORG EU  ] 's [LOC Baltic Sea Strategy  ] -- would cause the [ORG Balts  ] to become more suspicious of [MISC Russian  ] intentions. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [ORG MFA  ] considers the efforts of " some [ORG NATO  ] partners , like the [ORG Balts  ] " to stall [ORG NATO-Russia Council  ] ( [ORG NRC  ] ) cooperation as an impediment to [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to improve relations with [LOC Russia  ] . 
Moreover , the Balts' demand for [ORG NATO  ] contingency planning against possible [MISC Russian  ] aggression is likely to worry [LOC Russia  ] even more , according to the [ORG MOD  ] . 
Even though the [ORG Balts  ] are proving troublesome in the [ORG NRC  ] , the [ORG MFA  ] is equally frustrated by [LOC Russia  ] 's attempts to block cooperation . 
The [ORG MFA  ] believes the best move [LOC Russia  ] could take to improve [ORG NRC  ] relations would be to remove ( [MISC Russian  ] Permanent Representative ) Rogozin from [LOC Brussels.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Despite these tensions , the [ORG MFA  ] sees a window of opportunity to improve security cooperation with [LOC Russia  ] because of growing [MISC Russian  ] suspicion of [LOC Iran  ] . 
Looking at the recent [ORG G8 Summit  ] statement and conversations from [MISC German-Russian  ] consultations in July , the [ORG MFA  ] thinks [LOC Russia  ] may be willing to cooperate more with [ORG NATO  ] vis-a-vis [LOC Iran  ] , perhaps even on missile defense ( [LOC MD  ] ) . 
Although the [ORG MFA  ] acknowledges that it would be a hard sell , they do not consider it a lost cause . 
COMMENT <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [ORG Germans  ] are well-aware that their attempts to accommodate and reach out to the [MISC Russians  ] are viewed with suspicion by many countries in eastern [LOC Europe  ] . 
Defense [LOC BERLIN  ] 00000978 002 OF 002 Minister [PER Jung  ] 's trip to the [MISC Baltic  ] countries , [LOC Germany  ] 's participation in the [ORG NATO  ] [MISC Baltic  ] [ORG Air Policing Mission  ] and [ORG Steinmeier  ] 's joint visit to [LOC Ukraine  ] with [MISC Polish  ] FM [PER Sikorski  ] ( reftel ) are all aimed at reassuring the [ORG Balts  ] and other east [MISC Europeans  ] that [LOC Berlin  ] takes their security concerns seriously . 
The [MISC German  ] calculation is that these efforts will give them more freedom to draw [LOC Russia  ] closer to [ORG NATO  ] without incurring automatic opposition from the new Allies . 
The [ORG Germans  ] are also hoping to forestall moves that they feel would be counterproductive to the development of closer [ORG NATO-Russia  ] relations , particularly [ORG NATO  ] contingency planning oriented specifically against possible [MISC Russian  ] aggression . 
On [LOC MD  ] , the [ORG Germans  ] seem to be betting that in the end , we will decide to pursue some kind of system to protect [MISC European  ] allies and forward-deployed [LOC U.S.  ] forces against missile threats . 
As a result , they are urging the [MISC Russians  ] to keep an open mind about [LOC MD  ] so that this issue does not derail overall [ORG NATO-Russia  ] cooperation down the road .
