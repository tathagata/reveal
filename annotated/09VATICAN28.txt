REASON: 1.4 ( b ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] Together with other flaps , the recent global controversy over the lifted excommunication of a Holocaust denying bishop ( reftel ) exposed a major disconnect between [PER Pope Benedict XVI’s  ] stated intentions and the way in which his message is received by the wider world . 
There are many causes for this communication gap: the challenge of governing a hierarchical yet decentralized organization , leadership weaknesses at the top , and an undervaluing of ( and ignorance about ) 21st century communications . 
These factors have led to muddled , reactive messaging that reduces the volume of the moral megaphone the [LOC Vatican  ] uses to advance its objectives . 
This is especially true with audiences whose view of the [LOC Vatican  ] is informed largely by mass media coverage . 
There are signs that at least some in the [LOC Vatican  ] have learned their lessons and will work to reshape the Holy See’s communications structure . 
Whether they’ll prevail remains to be seen . 
End Summary . 
A CENTRALIZED HIERARCHY MAKING DECENTRALIZED DECISIONS --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [LOC Vatican  ] is highly hierarchical with the [PER Pope  ] ultimately responsible for all important matters . 
Yet it is also highly decentralized in its decision-making . 
This structure reflects belief in the principle of “subsidiarity”: leaving decisions to those closest to , and best informed on , a particular matter . 
On a practical level , however , subsidiarity can limit horizontal communication by eliminating peer consultation and review . 
This approach also encourages a narrow focus on issues at the expense of the big picture. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In discussing the recent crisis with [ORG CDA  ] and [ORG PAO  ] , Archbishop [PER Claudio Celli  ] , President of the [ORG Pontifical Council for Social Communications  ] , described the [LOC Church’s  ] current communication style as being focused on the content of a decision , rather than its public impact . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that this phenomenon is compounded by the fact that officials from the various [MISC Church  ] organs see themselves as advocates for their issues , without considering their impact on the [MISC Church  ] as a whole . 
The result is a process in which only a handful of experts are aware of imminent decisions -- even major decisions with broad implications -- and those who are become proponents , rather than impartial advisors to the [LOC Pope.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) A series of missteps during [PER Benedict’s Papacy  ] have made the lack of information-sharing in the [MISC Church  ] painfully clear . 
In 2006 , the [PER Pope  ] made a speech in [LOC Regensburg  ] that was widely decried as insulting to [MISC Muslims  ] , though he later explained he had no such intent . 
In 2008 , the [PER Pope  ] himself baptized ( i.e. , converted ) a prominent [MISC Muslim  ] during the 2008 [MISC Easter Vigil  ] service at [LOC St. Peters  ] , an event broadcast worldwide ; the Cardinal who runs [MISC Inter-Faith Dialogues  ] for the [MISC Church  ] knew nothing about the conversion until it happened . 
This year , Father [PER Federico Lombardi  ] , head of the [LOC Vatican  ] press office , and Cardinal [PER Walter Kasper  ] , President of the [ORG Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity  ] , which includes relations with [MISC Jews  ] , learned only after the fact about the decision to reinstate communion with schismatic [MISC Lefebrvist  ] bishops who included a Holocaust denier ( reftel ) . 
In the midst of that scandal , meanwhile , the [PER Pope  ] proposed promoting to auxiliary bishop a priest who said [PER Hurricane Katrina  ] was “divine retribution” for licentiousness in [LOC New Orleans  ] . 
The resulting outcry led the cleric to decline the offer . 
A TIN EAR AT THE TOP -------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) These public missteps have intensified scrutiny of the small group of decision-makers advising the [PER Pope  ] . 
Normally reserved [LOC Vatican  ] commentators have directed withering criticism their way . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , recently wrote that “curial chaos , confusion , and incompetence” had made clear “how dysfunctional the curia remains in terms of both crisis analysis and crisis management.” Secretary of State [PER Tarcisio Bertone  ] -- who is tasked with managing the Curia and is its highest ranking official after the [PER Pope  ] -- has been a particular target . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said Cardinal [PER Bertone  ] had “distinguished himself by his absence” during the [MISC Lefebrvist  ] controversy , and that the curia had become “more disorganized than before” under his leadership . 
Yet [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] may have understated the problem . 
At the height of the [MISC Lefebrvist  ] scandal , [PER Bertone  ] referred publicly to the offending bishop by the wrong name , then denounced the media for “inventing” a problem where there was none . 
Other critics note Bertone’s lack of diplomatic experience ( he speaks only [MISC Italian  ] , for example ) , and a personal style that elevates “pastoral” work -- with frequent foreign travel focusing on the spiritual needs of [MISC Catholics  ] around the world -- over foreign policy and management. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) More broadly , critics point to a lack of generational or geographical diversity in the [MISC Pope’s  ] inner circle . 
Most of the top ranks of the [LOC Vatican  ] -- all men , generally in their seventies -- do not understand modern media and new information technologies . 
The blackberry-using Father [PER Lombardi  ] remains an anomaly in a culture in which many officials do not even have official email accounts . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] laid even greater emphasis on the [MISC Italo-centric  ] nature of the [MISC Pope’s  ] closest advisors . 
Other than Archbishop [PER James Harvey  ] , an [MISC American  ] and head of the [LOC Papal  ] household , there is no one from an [MISC Anglophone  ] country in the [MISC Pope’s  ] inner circle . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said this meant few had exposure to the [MISC American  ] -- or , indeed , global -- rough and tumble of media communications . 
The [MISC Pope’s Italian  ] advisors , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , tend towards old-fashioned , inwardly focused communications written in “coded” language that no-one outside their tight circles can decipher . 
( The [MISC Israeli  ] Ambassador , for example , told [ORG CDA  ] that he recently received a [LOC Vatican  ] statement that was supposed to contain a positive message for [LOC Israel  ] , but it was so veiled he missed it , even when told it was there . 
) <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) There is also the question of who , if anyone , brings dissenting views to the [MISC Pope’s  ] attention . 
As noted , Cardinal [PER Bertone  ] is considered a “yes man , ” and other Cardinals don’t hold much sway with the [PER Pope  ] -- or lack the confidence to bring him bad news . 
And if bad news rarely filters out , leaks never spring . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that under [PER Pope John Paul  ] II leaks were much more common . 
While damaging , these leaks did allow time for critics of pending decisions to mobilize and present opposing views to the [PER Pope  ] in time . 
[PER Pope Benedict  ] and Cardinal [PER Bertone  ] run a much tighter ship , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , but at the expense of squashing coordination or allow dissenting voices to be heard . 
NOT SPIN CITY ------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) As has become evident throughout the controversies , much of the [LOC Vatican  ] hierarchy greatly undervalues external communication . 
Structurally , the [ORG Pontifical Council for Social Communications  ] and the [ORG Vatican Press Office  ] are weak . 
The former applies the [LOC Church’s  ] teachings to the field of communications and is not involved in shaping the [MISC Pope’s  ] message . 
The latter has the writ , but not the influence. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Father [PER Lombardi  ] , the spokesman , is not part of the [MISC Pope’s  ] inner circle . 
He has little influence over major decisions , even when he knows about them beforehand . 
And the poor man is terribly overworked: [PER Lombardi  ] is simultaneously the head of the [ORG Vatican Press Office  ] , [ORG Vatican Radio  ] ( which broadcasts in 45 languages ) , and the [ORG Vatican Television Center  ] , literally moving from one office to the other over the course of the day . 
It’s a grueling schedule on good days , and debilitating during crises . 
Father [PER Lombardi  ] is the deliverer , rather than a shaper , of the message . 
In the wake of the [MISC Lefebrvist  ] controversy , he openly said that the [LOC Vatican  ] press office “didn’t control the communication.” Without a comprehensive communication strategy in which he plays a central role , he is dependent on individual [MISC Church  ] organs and leaders seeking his advice . 
It’s a hit or miss proposition. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) There is another cost to divorcing decision-making from public spin: the [LOC Church’s  ] message is often unclear . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] candidly said that the [LOC Holy See  ] rarely considered how best to explain dogmatic , ecclesiastical , moral or other decisions to a broader public . 
He emphasized that the content of the message should not/not be different -- the [MISC Catholic  ] Church would often take positions contrary to public opinion -- but the [MISC Church  ] hierarchy needed to think more about how to present positions . 
CRACKING THE REAL DA VINCI CODE ? -------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The communication culture of the broader [MISC Catholic  ] Church is diverse , however , with many Church-affiliated organizations now excelling at communication . 
One example of a [MISC Church  ] organization that is using modern communications strategies to deliver its message , interestingly enough , is [ORG Opus Dei  ] . 
( [PER Pope John Paul  ] II was widely perceived as being more adept at public communications than [PER Benedict  ] ; his communications director , [PER Joaquin Navarro Valls  ] , famously belongs to [ORG Opus Dei  ] . 
) [ORG CDA  ] and [ORG PolOff  ] recently met with [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and discussed how [ORG Opus Dei  ] responded to the “Da [PER Vinci Code”  ] - a novel which pilloried the group . 
[PER Sanchez  ] said that [ORG Opus Dei  ] realized it could respond in one of three ways: ( 1 ) ignore the controversy ; ( 2 ) adopt a `no prisoners’ approach and refute every error ; or ( 3 ) treat the controversy as a chance to explain [ORG Opus Dei  ] to the world . 
[ORG Opus Dei  ] chose the third option , holding regular briefings for journalists and others , and the organization’s membership has actually increased as a result . 
FIXING WHAT’S LOST IN TRANSLATION --------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) There is a growing urgency within the [LOC Vatican  ] about the need to change the current communication culture . 
The rare public criticisms offered by Father [PER Lombardi  ] and Cardinal [PER Kasper  ] of their colleagues’ roles in the [MISC Lefebrvist  ] scandal are an extremely strong indicator of internal disquiet . 
There are a number of proposals circulating to help fix the problem . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] have confirmed privately to the Embassy that discussions are underway about having the [ORG Pontifical Council for Social Communications  ] assume a greater coordinating role on major decisions . 
Father [PER Lombardi  ] has privately proposed to his leadership the possibility of creating an office in the [ORG Secretariat of State  ] to flag potentially controversial decisions and has asked for resources to prepare translations of major statements more quickly . 
Other [LOC Vatican  ] insiders close to the [PER Pope  ] have suggested bringing more native [MISC English  ] speakers into positions in the [MISC Pope’s  ] inner circle . 
And not a few voices are calling for Cardinal Bertone’s removal from his current position . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Behind closed doors , our [LOC Vatican  ] contacts seems to be talking about nothing but the need for better internal coordination on decisions and planned public messages . 
Most Church leaders recoil at the notion that they could be seen as anti-Semitic or endorsing Holocaust denials , yet are confronting the ugly reality that many people actually believe these notions because of their own poor communications culture . 
But if or when change will come remains an open question . 
The structural and cultural roots of the current situation are deep , and will not be easily uprooted as they are closely connected to [PER Pope Benedict’s  ] governing style . 
Similar criticism after the disastrous [LOC Regensburg  ] speech led to little or no change . 
The percolating discussions regarding the creation of a policy coordinating body within the curia - and other possible solutions -- are hopeful signs . 
But they are not yet guarantees that change is coming . 
Stay tuned .
