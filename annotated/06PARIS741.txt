05 [LOC PARIS  ] 1229 [LOC PARIS  ] 00000741 001.2 OF 004 Classified By: Political Minister-Counselor [PER Josiah Rosenblatt  ] , reasons 1.4 ( b/d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: [LOC Togo  ] 's former Interior Minister [PER Francois Boko  ] on January 31 discussed [MISC Togo-Cote  ] d'Ivoire arms trafficking ( planes piloted by [MISC Belarusian  ] mercenaries were involved in the November 2004 bombings in [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] and had transited [LOC Togo  ] , but [LOC France  ] did not pursue information [PER Boko  ] says he provided ) ; political developments in [LOC Togo  ] ( President [PER Faure  ] uninterested in reform , continues to allow and benefit from illicit activities of his associates ) ; and [PER Boko  ] 's intentions to play a public role in Togo-related politics . 
[PER Boko  ] and the head of the [LOC Paris  ] law firm that employs him also offered brief comments on [LOC China  ] 's activities in [LOC Africa  ] . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) At his invitation , we met on January 31 with [PER Francois Boko  ] , who had served as [LOC Togo  ] 's Interior Minister until April 2005 , when he was removed from office , took refuge in the [MISC German  ] Embassy , and then left for exile in [LOC France  ] . 
[PER Boko  ] had broken ranks with the GoT by calling for the postponement of elections in [LOC Togo  ] in view of the instability building during the pre-election period ( Ref A ) . 
TOGO-COTE d'IVOIRE ARMS TRAFFICKING ----------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Boko  ] commented extensively on the links between [LOC Togo  ] and the November 6 , 2004 , bombing in [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] , when GOCI forces attacked a [MISC French  ] military base , killing nine [MISC French  ] soldiers and an Amcit civilian . 
He said that the two [MISC Sukhoi-25  ] aircraft used in the bombing had been provided to the GOCI by former [MISC French  ] gendarme [PER Robert Montoya  ] ( Refs B and C ) . 
[PER Montoya  ] had obtained these and other aircraft and military equipment from [LOC Belarus  ] and had also engaged [MISC Belarusian  ] pilots and technicians . 
The planes had arrived unassembled in [LOC Togo  ] , where they were assembled and then flown to [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] . 
[PER Boko  ] said that the GoT leadership and military were aware of the presence of the planes and pilots/technicians in [LOC Togo  ] . 
[PER Boko  ] said that [MISC French  ] forces also had to be aware of their presence because the [MISC Belarusian  ] planes were kept at the same [LOC Lome  ] air facility the [MISC French  ] were using to operate their own air missions in support of [MISC French  ] forces in [LOC Cote  ] d'Ivoire. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) After the November 6 bombings , [PER Boko  ] said that he had had the [MISC Belarusian  ] pilots/technicians arrested when they returned to [LOC Togo  ] from [LOC Cote  ] d'Ivoire . 
He said that there were nine of them . 
[PER Boko  ] said he furnished details about their identities and activities to the [MISC French  ] , through [LOC France  ] 's Embassy in [LOC Lome  ] and also through direct contact with General [PER Poncet  ] , who then commanded [LOC France  ] 's [MISC Operation Licorne  ] in [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] . 
[PER Boko  ] thought there would be high [MISC French  ] interest in the information he had conveyed but was surprised when the [MISC French  ] did not express much interest . 
After holding the nine [MISC Belarusians  ] for about two weeks , [PER Boko  ] was told by the [MISC French  ] ( including General [PER Poncet  ] , who communicated directly with [PER Boko  ] ) to release them . 
The only explanation he received ( again including from General [PER Poncet  ] ) was that [LOC France  ] " was not looking to complicate relations with [LOC Belarus  ] over this matter . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Boko  ] said he found this lack of [MISC French  ] interest surprising inasmuch as the bombing had resulted in the deaths of [MISC French  ] soldiers . 
He predicted that a scandal was brewing that might erupt once [MISC French  ] judicial investigation ( Ref C , paras 6-7 ) of the case unearthed more facts . 
[PER Boko  ] said that recent [MISC French  ] media reports on the " discovery " of a second set of planes in [LOC Lome  ] , along with their connection to [PER Montoya  ] , were in fact an old story that the press should have reported a year ago . 
This issue was " news " only because of Judge [PER Brigitte Raynaud  ] 's investigation , itself prompted by legal claims on the part of the families of the soldiers killed in the raid . 
The planes had been sitting unused at the [LOC Lome  ] air facility since the time of the bombings in [LOC Cote  ] d'Ivoire. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Boko  ] said that [PER Robert Montoya  ] was among the group of [MISC French  ] and other non-Togolese that had long had access to the [LOC Eyadema  ] regime . 
This group , which included [PER Charles Debbasch  ] ( Ref D ) , was involved in a great deal of nefarious activity in [LOC Togo  ] , [PER Boko  ] asserted , and had always enjoyed the protection of the regime . 
[PER Boko  ] said that after the [MISC French  ] press this [LOC PARIS  ] 00000741 002.2 OF 004 past week had begun reporting on [PER Montoya  ] , his arms trafficking , and his connection to [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] , [PER Montoya  ] 's wife went to a notary in [LOC Togo  ] who handled [PER Montoya  ] 's businesses . 
This notary , according to [PER Boko  ] , dissolved all of [PER Montoya  ] 's businesses and then created new ones , but listed different owners . 
This , [PER Boko  ] said , was done to protect [PER Montoya  ] 's assets should legal action be taken against him or his companies . 
[PER Boko  ] said that the GoT had issued [PER Debbasch  ] a [MISC Togolese  ] diplomatic passport as a form of protection . 
Even though [PER Debbasch  ] had been convicted of financial offenses in [LOC France  ] and was therefore subject to arrest ( Ref E ) , [PER Boko  ] claims that [PER Debbasch  ] traveled to [LOC France  ] to celebrate the December 2005 holidays without , apparently , being hindered by the [ORG GoF  ] . 
7 , ( U ) See concluding paragraphs of this message for recent media reports on the investigation into the November 6 , 2004 , bombing . 
DEVELOPMENTS IN [LOC TOGO  ] -------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Boko  ] said that [PER Faure  ] was making no effort to institute reform and seemed content to live within the structures [LOC Eyadema  ] had left for him . 
[PER Boko  ] related that the small inner circle surrounding [PER Faure  ] ( which included foreigners such as [PER Montoya  ] and [PER Debbasch  ] ) continued to carry out their illicit activities , which benefited themselves and [PER Faure  ] as well . 
This reliance on criminal or quasi-criminal activities allowed [PER Faure  ] to lead a comfortable , if not luxurious , life , and provided no incentive for him to institute the kinds of reforms that might make [LOC Togo  ] more acceptable to international lenders or private sector investors . 
All of which was very bad for [LOC Togo  ] , in [PER Boko  ] 's view. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Boko  ] noted [PER Faure  ] 's inability to gain international " recognition . 
" No one of significance wanted to meet with him and he could be considered a pariah internationally . 
One of his only formal trips abroad had been to [LOC Iran  ] , and who needed [LOC Iran  ] 's blessing , [PER Boko  ] asked rhetorically . 
[PER Boko  ] said that [PER Faure  ] had nine wives , one of whom was a cousin of opposition leader [PER Gilchrist Olympio  ] ( see below ) , with another being the daughter of [LOC Ghana  ] 's President [PER Kufuor  ] . 
[PER Boko  ] said these marriages were useful for [PER Faure  ] politically . 
[PER BOKO  ] EXASPERATED WITH THE [MISC FRENCH  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Throughout the meeting , [PER Boko  ] expressed dismay with [MISC French  ] attitudes towards [LOC Togo  ] . 
The [MISC French  ] apparently did not want to pursue the November 2004 bombing and the links with [LOC Togo  ] and [LOC Belarus  ] , but this reticence , he again predicted , could become more problematic if Judge [PER Raynaud  ] 's investigation gained traction with the media . 
( NOTE: [MISC French  ] investigative judges have a great deal of independence and can pursue investigations that in some cases the rest of the [ORG GoF  ] might not want investigated . 
END NOTE . 
) [PER Boko  ] said the [MISC French  ] also did not seem concerned about [PER Faure  ] and his failure to reform . 
Exasperated , [PER Boko  ] said [LOC France  ] appeared ready to do what it has done so many times before -- back " the man of the moment " so long as " the man " can ensure some degree of stability . 
[PER Boko  ] noted that the [MISC French  ] had invested so much in [LOC Eyadema  ] that they perhaps could not contemplate starting from scratch . 
He acknowledged that events in [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] , after Houphouet 's death , may have served as a lesson to the [MISC French  ] in terms of seeking stability rather than letting chaos ensue when a dynasty ends . 
BOKO'S POLITICAL AMBITIONS -------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Boko  ] confided that he was soon going to re-enter the [MISC Togolese  ] political scene . 
He was scheduled to be the main speaker at a February 4 event in [LOC Paris  ] to which all [MISC Togolese  ] , the press , and friends of [LOC Togo  ] were invited . 
He explained that he was not speaking at this event to proclaim himself as the " opposition 's new leader , " but instead hoped that the meeting would allow for open discussion of events in [LOC Togo  ] and serve as a vehicle for uniting the [MISC Togolese  ] diaspora. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Boko  ] said he planned to speak on three general themes: ( 1 ) the need for [LOC Togo  ] 's opposition leaders and members of the diaspora to put aside factional differences and meet together to discuss [LOC Togo  ] 's future and adopt a common roadmap for progress ; ( 2 ) the need to reassure and win over [LOC Togo  ] 's military by explaining that " reform " was not directed against the military ; and ( 3 ) the need to unite in demanding that [LOC Togo  ] 's constitution and laws be respected , particularly concerning presidential succession . 
[LOC PARIS  ] 00000741 003.2 OF 004 <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Boko  ] at an earlier meeting revealed that the [ORG GoF  ] , upon allowing him to live in [LOC France  ] , suggested that he not get involved in politics . 
Pressed about this , [PER Boko  ] countered that he was not a formal " political refugee " and that he was therefore not subject to [ORG GoF  ] control over his activities . 
He did say , however , that he had informed the [ORG GoF  ] that he would not speak publicly about " sensitive " issues , such as the [PER Montoya  ] affair or [LOC Togo  ] 's role in international drug smuggling . 
He told the [MISC French  ] that he would focus on [LOC Togo  ] 's future and how to instill political change in a positive manner . 
[PER Boko  ] indicated that [ORG GoF  ] security elements provide intermittent surveillance of his home and workplace to protect him and his family . 
RIVALRY WITH [PER OLYMPIO  ] ? --------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Boko  ] said he did not have much contact with [PER Gilchrist Olympio  ] , who seemed to want to avoid [PER Boko  ] and who resented the possibility of [PER Boko  ] 's becoming a new opposition figure . 
In [PER Boko  ] 's opinion , [PER Olympio  ] was past his prime and should understand that a new generation was on the scene . 
It was futile for [PER Olympio  ] to try to refight political battles dating back to the 1960s , when [LOC Eyadema  ] ousted [PER Olympio  ] 's father from power and may have been involved in his death . 
[PER Boko  ] was very annoyed that after the February 4 meeting was announced in December , [PER Olympio  ] a few weeks later announced a meeting of his own , to take place at the same time and on the same date as [PER Boko  ] 's February 4 meeting . 
To [PER Boko  ] , this was a ham-fisted attempt to disrupt [PER Boko  ] 's meeting . 
[PER Boko  ] said the [MISC Togolese  ] community harshly criticized [PER Olympio  ] 's announcement . 
Realizing his error , [PER Olympio  ] had not said anything further about holding his meeting and [PER Boko  ] was not sure it would take place . 
[PER Boko  ] expected 400-500 to attend [PER Boko  ] 's meeting. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER Boko  ] also criticized [PER Olympio  ] for his willingness to meet with and possibly curry favor with [PER Faure  ] . 
He noted that [PER Olympio  ] seemed to go out of his way to travel to places where he knew he would have a chance to meet with [PER Faure  ] . 
This , [PER Boko  ] claimed , discredited [PER Olympio  ] in the eyes of the [MISC Togolese  ] diaspora . 
As a parting shot , [PER Boko  ] said that [PER Olympio  ] suffered credibility problems because [PER Faure  ] was married to one of [PER Olympio  ] 's relatives. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) COMMENT: It was not clear from [PER Boko  ] 's remarks the extent to which he is prepared to anoint himself a leader ( or THE leader ) of the [MISC Togolese  ] opposition . 
He denied that he intended to do so , speaking of his simple desire to unite the [MISC Togolese  ] people . 
Still , his own ambition did not lie deeply below the surface of his comments , and we will try to assess his motives as well as the degree to which the [MISC Togolese  ] community views him as a new leader . 
END COMMENT. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) BIO NOTE: [PER Boko  ] said he was happy working at the law offices of [PER Alain Feneon  ] , where he is one of five lawyers engaged in facilitating the work of non-African companies in [LOC Africa  ] . 
He said , however , that he was applying for one of the four vacant vice-presidency positions at the [ORG African Development Bank  ] . 
At the same time , his [MISC French-citizen  ] wife was applying for a position at the [ORG EU  ] in [LOC Brussels  ] , which would require commuting daily by [ORG TGV  ] . 
He said he did not know how feasible obtaining either job would be , as they would both place strains on the [PER Boko  ] household , which would be complicated by the birth of his second child within the next few weeks . 
[PER Boko  ] said the couple also had a nine-year-old son . 
VISIT TO LAW OFFICE , COMMENTS ON [LOC CHINA  ] -------------------------------------- 18 , ( C ) [PER Boko  ] offered a tour of his law office , where we met with the firm 's head , [PER Alain Feneon  ] ( PROTECT THROUGHOUT ) . 
The firm is heavily engaged in providing consulting services and legal advice to companies doing business in [LOC Africa  ] and to a few [MISC African  ] groups seeking opportunities in [LOC Europe  ] . 
The firm has operated since 1978 and [PER Feneon  ] has been closely involved in the [ORG OHADA  ] project to harmonize the commercial and business laws of several [MISC African  ] countries . 
He described the difficulties of reconciling civil and common law approaches but stressed the great progress [ORG OHADA  ] has made. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) [PER Feneon  ] and [PER Boko  ] described the appeal of [LOC Africa  ] to international businesses , particularly those interested in infrastructure development and resource extraction . 
[PER Boko  ] said he was working on several projects involving [ORG UNDP  ] activity in [LOC Africa  ] and one case involving [LOC Benin  ] and the [ORG Millennium Challenge Corporation  ] . 
[PER Boko  ] noted that [PER Faure  ] had recently rescinded an oil contract with the [ORG Hunt Oil Co.  ] ; he suspected that [PER Faure  ] would make a new deal with the [MISC Chinese  ] . 
[LOC PARIS  ] 00000741 004.2 OF 004 <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) [PER Feneon  ] said he was aware of " at least 500 [MISC Chinese  ] companies , " most of which were state owned , seeking opportunities in [LOC Africa  ] . 
He said the [MISC Chinese  ] were " interested in everything . 
" Several clients of [PER Feneon  ] 's firm are [MISC Chinese  ] and he provided a brochure on the firm printed in [MISC Chinese  ] . 
[PER Feneon  ] described one case involving [LOC China  ] and [LOC Namibia  ] . 
He said that [LOC Namibia  ] had been unable to repay a [MISC Chinese  ] loan . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] , he said , quickly told [LOC Namibia  ] , " don't worry about it . 
Just give us 5,000 passports and residency documents . 
" [PER Feneon  ] claimed that 5,000 [MISC Chinese  ] families were resettled in [LOC Namibia  ] as a result and were now engaged in any number of small and large business activities in [LOC Namibia  ] . 
[PER Feneon  ] commented that this kind of arrangement helped solve two problems for the [MISC Chinese:  ] easing population pressures and establishing communities in [LOC Africa  ] that could be of use to [LOC China  ] later . 
PRESS REPORTS ON TOGO-COTE d'IVOIRE-MONTOYA ------------------------------------------- <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Paris  ] daily [ORG Le Monde  ] carried two articles on January 31 concerning the investigations into the November 6 , 2004 , bombing incident in [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] and the [MISC Togo/Montoya  ] connection . 
This followed previous [ORG Le Monde  ] coverage reported Ref [PER C. One  ] article said that Judge [PER Raynaud  ] 's visit to [LOC Togo  ] in mid-January had been useful and that she obtained numerous documents implicating [PER Montoya  ] , whom she reportedly wanted to prosecute for " complicity " in the bombing . 
[MISC French  ] General [PER Michel Masson  ] of the [MISC French  ] military 's Directorate for Military Intelligence reportedly confirmed [PER Montoya  ] 's involvement in supplying the two aircraft that did the bombing . 
The article also outlines [PER Montoya  ] 's involvement with the [MISC Belarusian  ] pilots/technicians ( the article says there were eight of them , whereas [PER Boko  ] said there were nine ) . 
The [MISC Belarusians  ] were reportedly released from [MISC Togolese  ] custody into the care of a [MISC Belarusian  ] woman who turned out to be [PER Montoya  ] 's secretary . 
[ORG Le Monde  ] reports that [PER Montoya  ] is also under investigation by [MISC Togolese  ] authorities . 
[PER Montoya  ] is quoted in the article as admitting his involvement in the affair but denying its illegality. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( U ) The second [ORG Le Monde  ] article contains statements by the [MISC Ivoirian  ] members of the crews of the two aircraft involved in the bombing ( both aircraft were piloted by a [MISC Belarusian  ] with an [MISC Ivoirian  ] co-pilot ) . 
The [MISC Ivoirians  ] are quoted as saying they did not intend to attack the [MISC French  ] base but rather nearby hostile forces . 
Because of the proximity to the base , any bombing of the [MISC French  ] was accidental .
