END SUMMARY . 
Focus on Climate Change ---------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The [PER Dalai Lama  ] argued that the political agenda should be sidelined for five to ten years and the international community should shift its focus to climate change on the [MISC Tibetan  ] plateau . 
Melting glaciers , deforestation , and increasingly polluted water from mining projects were problems that “cannot wait.” The [PER Dalai Lama  ] criticized [MISC China’s  ] energy policy , alleging that dam construction in [LOC Kham  ] and [LOC Amdo  ] have displaced thousands of [MISC Tibetans  ] and left temples and monasteries underwater . 
He recommended the [LOC PRC  ] compensate [MISC Tibetans  ] for disrupting their nomadic lifestyle with vocational training , such as weaving. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [PER Dalai Lama  ] requested the [LOC United States  ] consider engaging [LOC China  ] on environmental issues in [LOC Tibet  ] and suggested increased collaboration between [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Chinese  ] scientists . 
The Ambassador assured the [PER Dalai Lama  ] that President [PER Obama  ] remained concerned about climate change and specifically asked him to address the issue in [LOC India  ] and the region . 
Waiting for the [LOC PRC  ] to [LOC Reengage  ] ---------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [PER Dalai Lama  ] reiterated that while his faith in the [MISC Chinese  ] government had grown “thinner” after eight rounds of failed negotiations , his faith in the [MISC Chinese  ] people had “never shaken.” During the past year , the [PER Dalai Lama  ] met with several hundred [MISC Chinese  ] scholars and writers to discuss [LOC Tibet  ] . 
The [PER Dalai Lama  ] was heartened by the increased “expressions of solidarity from [MISC Chinese  ] brothers and sisters” and reported that 682 Chinese-language articles focused on [LOC Tibet  ] were published over the past year . 
The [PER Dalai Lama  ] conveyed he would continue to engage the [MISC Chinese  ] people who wanted a more open society. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [PER Dalai Lama  ] provided the Ambassador with a brief account of the most recent negotiations between his envoys and the [LOC PRC  ] , expressing disappointment that the [MISC Chinese  ] government had rejected the Memorandum for Genuine Autonomy before his envoys reached [LOC Beijing  ] ( Ref A ) . 
When Ambassador [PER Roemer  ] inquired about sending envoys to [LOC Beijing  ] again , The [PER Dalai Lama  ] needed some positive sign from the [LOC PRC  ] that it was prepared for substantive dialogue because [MISC Tibetans  ] currently felt [LOC China  ] preferred “ruthless oppression.” On the sidelines of the meeting , Representative of the [PER Dalai Lama  ] in [LOC India  ] [PER Tempa Tsering  ] told [PER Poloff  ] that the clarification note for the Memorandum of Autonomy had not been completed and confirmed he would send the [MISC Embassy  ] a copy of the note after its completion ( Ref B ) . 
[ORG PRC’s Authoritarian System  ] “Not [ORG Sustainable”  ] ---------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [PER Dalai Lama  ] told the Ambassador that “narrow mindedness” had led [LOC China  ] to feel threatened by [MISC Tibetans’  ] desire to preserve their culture and language. “The past was NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00001667 002 OF 002 the past , ” and now [MISC Tibetans  ] and [MISC Chinese  ] must envision a new reality based on “common sense and common interest.” The [ORG European Union  ] and [LOC United Kingdom  ] were examples of countries uniting for these reasons , while preserving national identity . 
He cited these examples as high goals to aspire toward for this region’s peace and prosperity . 
The [PER Dalai Lama  ] acknowledged the greatness of [LOC China  ] and its people , but maintained that the authoritarian system was not sustainable . 
If [LOC China  ] succeeded in becoming a superpower , it would resemble the former [LOC Soviet Union  ] , securing its rule using suspicion and fear . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] should consider [MISC China’s  ] values when doing business with the [LOC PRC  ] and strive to bring [LOC China  ] into the democratic mainstream . 
October Visit ---------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( SBU ) When the Ambassador asked about the objective of his October visit to [LOC Washington  ] , the [PER Dalai Lama  ] replied that he had “no particular points at this moment , ” adding President [PER Obama  ] should not anticipate a shift from the [LOC Middle Way  ] . 
He underlined that Prime Minister-in-exile [PER Samdhong Rinpoche  ] was the “real authority” and would set the political agenda . 
The [PER Dalai Lama  ] applauded efforts to strengthen the [MISC U.S.-India  ] relationship , adding it was “logical and essential” for the two greatest democracies to collaborate closely . 
He told the Ambassador that his [MISC Indian  ] friends praised the [MISC Secretary’s  ] visit and urged the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC India  ] to continue along this positive trajectory , “whether other countries like it or not.” The Ambassador said the [MISC U.S.-India  ] partnership is a top priority for President [PER Obama  ] and Secretary [PER Clinton  ] and we were pursuing a broad and deep strategic partnership. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) COMMENT . 
The [PER Dalai Lama’s  ] message to the Ambassador may signal a broader shift in strategy to reframe the [LOC Tibet  ] issue as an environmental concern . 
When Ambassador [PER Roemer  ] discussed the importance of climate change issues and mentioned bilateral projects between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC India  ] , the [PER Dalai Lama  ] said that there were “three poles” in danger of melting: the north pole , the south pole , and the glaciers at the pole of [LOC Tibet  ] . 
[MISC Tibetans  ] have watched closely as the [LOC United States  ] launched the new [MISC Strategic  ] and [ORG Economic Dialogue with China  ] , with climate change as a main focus , as well as the [MISC Secretary’s  ] emphasis on climate change during her July visit to [LOC India  ] . 
In this new context , the [PER Dalai Lama  ] appears intent on leveraging closer [MISC U.S.-China  ] relations to address the pressing environmental challenges and problems in [LOC Tibet  ] .
