( [ORG U  ] ) [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] Crown Prince [PER Mohammed  ] bin [PER Zayed  ] , s weekly Sunday " VIP Majlis " provided an excellent opportunity for a visiting [ORG National Defense University  ] delegation to observe first-hand the UAEG , s informal consultative process .

[LOC Iraq  ] ------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Sison  ] noted that day 's visit to [LOC Iraq  ] by Secretary Rice , highlighting the Secretary 's encouragement SIPDIS for continued momentum in the political process and her meetings with PM al-Jaafari and [ORG KDP  ] leader [PER Barzani  ] . 
[PER MbZ  ] voiced disdain for al-Jaafari , citing ( again ) his concerns over the Prime Minister 's ties to [LOC Iran  ] . 
These concerns were aimed at [LOC Jaafari  ] 's [ORG Dawaa Party  ] colleagues , as well . 
While agreeing that it was important for [LOC Iraq  ] 's [PER Sunni Arabs  ] to be more involved in the political process and in drafting the constitution , [PER MbZ  ] complained that " there wasn't one worthwhile [PER Sunni  ] " on the scene . 
He criticized new [PER Sunni Defense  ] Minister [PER Dulaimi  ] as being " in it for himself . 
" Nor did [PER MbZ  ] have anything good to say about former [MISC Iraqi  ] Finance Minister [PER Mahdi  ] 's nomination as one of two Vice Presidents , complaining that [PER Mahdi  ] " did not work for the people of [LOC Iraq  ] . 
" Nonetheless , [PER MbZ  ] said he agreed with the [ORG USG  ] 's efforts to encourage the various [MISC Iraqi  ] factions to work together . 
The [ORG UAE  ] would continue to help train [MISC Iraqi  ] police forces at the [ORG UAE  ] 's police academy in [LOC Al Ain  ] and provide reconstruction assistance . 
It was important for the region as a whole that the [LOC U.S.  ] and its allies " got it right " in [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , and [LOC Egypt  ] , he underscored . 
( Note: [PER MbZ  ] aide [PER Yousef al Otaiba  ] had a few days earlier shared with Ambassador concerns passed by former PM [PER Allawi  ] that [PER Dulaimi  ] was " devious , " " bad news , " " very close " to [MISC Iranian  ] intelligence , and had been introduced to the [MISC Iranians  ] by [PER Chalabi  ] . 
[PER Yousef  ] had also noted the UAEG , s impression [PER Mahdi  ] had not always been a " team player " in the government of former PM [PER Allawi  ] . 
End note . 
) [LOC Iran  ] ---- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) Turning to [LOC Iran  ] , [PER MbZ  ] voiced certainty that the [MISC EU-3  ] efforts with [LOC Iran  ] would break down and that [LOC Iran  ] would resume its nuclear activities ) if it had not already done so . 
Repeating concerns first voiced to us in February ( reftel ) , [PER MbZ  ] appeared convinced that it was only a matter of time before [LOC Israel  ] or the [LOC U.S.  ] would strike [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear facility targets . 
[LOC U.S.  ] installations in the [LOC Gulf  ] could be targeted by [LOC Iran  ] in the aftermath of such an action , he warned . 
[PER MbZ  ] agreed with the [ORG USG  ] , s tough line with [LOC Tehran  ] and the [MISC Europeans  ] . 
A nuclear-armed [LOC Iran  ] would destabilize the [LOC Gulf  ] region and possibly allow terrorist access to [ORG WMD  ] . 
[PER MbZ  ] asked Lt. [PER Gen. Dunn  ] whether it would be possible for &anyone8 to " take out " all locations of concern in [LOC Iran  ] via air power ; Lt. [PER Gen. Dunn  ] voiced doubt that this would be possible given the dispersed locations . 
" Then it will take ground forces ! 
" [PER MbZ  ] exclaimed . 
Ambassador noted that the [ORG UAE  ] 's Director of Military Intelligence , [MISC BG Essa  ] al [MISC Mazrouei  ] , would pay counterpart visits this week to [ORG CENTCOM  ] , J-2 , [ORG DIA  ] , and [ORG CIA  ] for discussions on [LOC Iran  ] and Iraq-related matters . 
[PER MbZ  ] said he looked forward to sharing " contingency planning " scenarios in future conversations . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] -------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Ambassador asked about [PER MbZ  ] 's visit the week before to [LOC Lahore  ] to meet with [MISC Pakistani  ] President [PER Musharraf  ] . 
[PER MbZ  ] chuckled and asked why the [ORG USG  ] " always " convinced the [MISC Pakistanis  ] to delay news of the capture of senior [ORG Al Qaeda  ] operatives such as [MISC Abu Faraj  ] al [PER Libbi  ] . 
[PER MbZ  ] went on to congratulate [LOC Washington  ] for its decision to allow [LOC U.S.  ] firms to bid for contracts to provide [MISC F-16s  ] and other defense technology to [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
It was important to support [PER Musharraf  ] as he battled the terrorists , he emphasized . 
While the [MISC Indians  ] had and would continue to balk at the decision , the region needed [PER Musharraf  ] to stay strong . 
There was no alternative leader in sight , [PER MbZ  ] opined . 
Besides , he continued , the [MISC F-16  ] decision would not tip the military balance between [LOC India  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
Even if it had , [LOC India  ] 's strength as a stable democracy would ensure that it would not ever be in as " risky " a situation as its neighbor . 
[PER MbZ  ] then slapped his knee and said " you , ll never guess what [PER Musharraf  ] asked me...he asked me whether the [ORG UAE  ] had received approval for the Predator ! 
" ( Note: the [ORG USG  ] 's inability to meet the [ORG UAE  ] 's request for an armed Predator remains a sore point for [PER MbZ  ] , although he has not directly raised the issue with us for some time . 
) Gyrocopter , [ORG GAWC  ] ---------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER MbZ  ] also referred to his interest in exploring selling the [ORG UAE  ] 's " gyrocopter " ( a helicopter-supported UAV co-developed with [MISC Austrian  ] company [ORG Schiebel  ] ) to the [ORG U.S. Air Force  ] , an idea he first floated during [PER Gen. Moseley  ] , s visit for the May 3 [MISC F-16  ] ceremony . 
[PER MbZ  ] noted that his aide would pass detailed gyrocopter specifications to the Embassy this week .

[PER MbZ  ] expressed satisfaction over the relationship between the [ORG UAE  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Air Forces  ] , but expressed disappointment that more [ORG GCC  ] countries had not joined recent [ORG GAWC  ] classes . 
Ambassador noted the recent robust participation by [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] in the [ORG GAWC  ] 's fourth class , which had included six [MISC Saudi  ] F-15s and two young pilots who were also members of the [MISC Saudi  ] royal family . 
[PER MbZ  ] asked whether the two high-ranking [MISC Saudis  ] had actually completed all requirements for graduation or had been " passed through . 
" Ambassador confirmed that they had completed all course requirements . 
[PER MbZ  ] commented that " the real reason " the [MISC Saudis  ] had turned out for the [ORG GAWC  ] class had been " to see what the [ORG UAE  ] was up to " with the [MISC F-16  ] [ORG Block  ] 60 and other procurement successes . 
Although [LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC Jordan  ] wished to join in the next [ORG GAWC  ] class , [PER MbZ  ] added , they also wanted the [ORG UAE Air Force  ] to pay fuel costs . 
[PER MbZ  ] said he had asked both countries " to go talk to [ORG ADNOC  ] , " the state-owned [ORG Abu Dhabi National Oil Company  ] . 
[LOC France  ] ------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) [PER MbZ  ] noted that he would travel to [LOC Paris  ] June 18-20 to meet with President [PER Chirac  ] , recalling that he had canceled his trip to [LOC France  ] at the last minute in mid-January .
