( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Summary:  ] The [ORG Landless People 's Movement  ] ( [ORG MST  ] ) increased activity in recent months in the run up to " Red April , " the traditional high season for [ORG MST  ] land invasions . 
The main reason for the uptick in activity , according to observers , is the [ORG MST  ] 's weakness . 
Increasingly ignored by its former supporter , President [PER Lula  ] and his [ORG PT Worker 's Party  ] , and undercut by both economic growth and the positive effects of [PER Lula  ] 's [ORG Bolsa Familia  ] ( [ORG BF  ] ) program , the [ORG MST  ] finds itself on the defensive . 
It remains to be seen whether a weakened [ORG MST  ] would lose influence in [LOC Brazil  ] , however . 
The organization is responding to challenges by radicalizing its actions , distancing itself from the President , and broadening its message . 
In a period of global economic turbulence , a leaner [ORG MST  ] could still present problems for the [ORG GOB  ] . 
End Summary . 
The [ORG MST  ] ------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) The [ORG Landless People 's Movement  ] ( [ORG MST  ] ) is a twenty-five year old social movement whose members take over privately held lands , alleging that the lands are either not legally titled and/or not being used productively , in accordance with the [MISC Brazilian  ] constitution . 
[ORG MST  ] supporters argue that the movement is an understandable activist response to [LOC Brazil  ] 's unequal land distribution . 
[ORG MST  ] critics argue that the movement is a violent , illegal shake-down operation that uses land invasions to capture resources , disrupt agriculture , and promote violence . 
( For more background , see Reftel . 
) More Active , More Visible ------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) There has been a predictable and noticeable uptick in the activities of the [ORG Landless People 's Movement  ] ( [ORG MST  ] ) over the last three months as April approached . 
April is traditionally the most active [ORG MST  ] month and coordinated land invasions take place to bring greater national exposure to the [ORG MST  ] . 
( Note: According to the [ORG MST  ] , the group focuses activity in April as a commemoration for the confrontation with military police at [LOC ElDorado  ] de [LOC Carajas  ] , [LOC Para State  ] in 1996 in which 19 [ORG MST  ] members were killed . 
End Note . 
) Among the recent actions are the following: -On February 21 , [ORG MST  ] members reportedly shot four security guards who were working on a farm in [LOC San Joaquim  ] dos [LOC Montes  ] in [LOC Pernambuco State  ] in northeast [LOC Brazil  ] after [ORG MST  ] members tried to invade and take over the property. -On February 24 , a faction of the [ORG MST  ] invaded eleven farms in the [LOC Pontal  ] do [LOC Paranapanema  ] in western [LOC Sao Paulo State  ] . 
[ORG MST  ] leaders dubbed this action " Red Carnival " because it took place at the same time as the popular [MISC Brazilian  ] holiday . 
[LOC Sao Paulo  ] State representatives broke off talks with the [ORG MST  ] after the takeover and two days later , [ORG MST  ] members abandoned the farm in what they described as a conciliatory gesture. -On February 28 , [ORG MST  ] members invaded properties in [LOC Para State  ] owned by [PER Daniel Dantas  ] , a [MISC Brazilian  ] banker under investigation on charges of corruption . 
Three weeks later , the police officer who led the investigation against [PER Dantas  ] , [PER Protogenes Queiroz  ] , defended the [ORG MST  ] 's takeover of lands owned by " the bandit banker " at a pro-MST gathering in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] . 
( Note and [PER Comment: Queiroz  ] was removed from the [PER Dantas  ] case for allegedly misusing wiretaps in his investigation . 
By targeting [LOC Dantas'  ] lands , the [ORG MST  ] guaranteed that it would get visibility . 
End Note and Comment . 
) [ORG MST  ] Critics Strike Back ----------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) The [ORG MST  ] 's critics have been active in questioning the organization 's methods and subjecting its activities to more rigid scrutiny . 
Among the charges recently leveled against the MST: -On March 29 , [LOC Sao Paulo  ] daily " [ORG Folha de Sao Paulo  ] " ran a long story detailing how the [ORG GOB  ] gave millions in grants to [ORG NGOs  ] linked to the [ORG MST  ] , in effect funding the movement 's activities . 
Subsequent media reports indicate that this funding has decreased dramatically . 
( Note: According to the [MISC NGO  ] [PER Contas Abertas  ] , direct federal transfers to [ORG NGOs  ] linked to the [ORG MST  ] reached a peak in 2004 , when they received [MISC R$  ] 12.56 million . 
During the first six years of President [PER Lula  ] 's mandate , the [ORG MST  ] received a total of [MISC R$  ] 42.13 [LOC SAO PAULO  ] 00000200 002 OF 003 million ( approximately 18.72 million USD ) in the first six years of [PER Lula  ] 's mandate . 
However , the annual funding dropped to [MISC R$  ] 1.47 million in 2008 . 
End Note . 
) -In February , [ORG Supreme Federal Tribunal  ] ( [ORG STF  ] ) President [PER Gilmar Mendes  ] urged governors in states where the [ORG MST  ] is active to enforce the law against violations of property . 
[PER Mendes  ] also questioned the [ORG MST  ] 's financing , stating that the [ORG MST  ] cannot receive public funds . 
President [PER Lula  ] later stated that [PER Mendes  ] spoke as a private citizen and not as [ORG STF  ] President , a characterization that [PER Mendes  ] later denied. -In its January 28 edition , news weekly " [MISC Veja  ] " published a long article entitled " The [ORG Guerrilla Manual  ] " that produced papers , seized from an [ORG MST  ] encampment , detailing how [ORG MST  ] members planned to break the law - including alleged plans to commit document fraud and other illegal activity . 
Twenty-Five Years: But Not a Happy Birthday ------------------------------------------- 5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Behind the increase in takeovers and the media discussion lies the fundamental reality of the [ORG MST  ] 's decreasing strength . 
This year was the 25th anniversary of the movement , and the [ORG MST  ] still finds itself challenged by a number of factors , the most prominent of which is , ironically , its erstwhile ally , President [PER Lula  ] . 
6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The flagship of [PER Lula  ] 's poverty reduction strategy is the [ORG Bolsa Familia  ] ( [ORG BF  ] ) program . 
[ORG BF  ] recipients have to stay in one place and keep their children in school to receive benefits . 
This directly cuts into the pool of rootless poor that constitute the best targets for [ORG MST  ] recruitment for land takeovers . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's strong economy , particularly the stunning growth in agricultural exports , created new jobs in rural areas and closely tied agricultural interests to [PER Lula  ] 's government . 
The [ORG GOB  ] is understandably reluctant to upset the prosperous applecart of agriculture-driven exports by pushing for a massive agrarian reform of the type envisioned by the [ORG MST  ] , which would promote small and medium-sized landholdings . 
7 . 
( U ) The [ORG MST  ] 's frustration with President [PER Lula  ] explains the movement 's decision not to invite the [MISC Brazilian  ] President to an " anti-imperialist " conclave its leaders organized at January 's [MISC World Social Forum  ] meeting in [LOC Belem  ] . 
[ORG MST  ] leaders met instead with the Presidents of [LOC Venezuela  ] , [LOC Bolivia  ] , [LOC Ecuador  ] and [LOC Paraguay  ] , the last of which used the occasion to criticize the treaty that governs the [ORG Itaipu Dam  ] , jointly owned by [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Paraguay  ] . 
( Note: [LOC Paraguay  ] 's President has repeatedly criticized the [ORG Itaipu Treaty  ] , which determines the price [LOC Brazil  ] pays for electricity generated by the dam . 
End Note . 
) 8 . 
( U ) The [ORG MST  ] 's problems , however , are not just personal , but structural . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's booming agricultural development and the [PER Lula  ] government 's successes reduced the space for land invasions . 
University of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] ( USP ) Geographer and [ORG MST  ] analyst Professor [PER Ariovaldo Umbelino de Oliveira  ] cited statistics kept by the [ORG Pastoral Land Commission  ] ( [ORG CPT  ] ) to make this case . 
According to the [ORG CPT  ] , the number of people living in [ORG MST  ] encampments ( land occupiers ) plunged from almost 60,000 in 2003 to just over 6,000 today , a drop of almost 90 percent . 
But Don't Count the [ORG MST  ] Out --------------------------- 9 . 
( U ) Despite the movement 's problems , observers maintain that the [ORG MST  ] remains an important force and might even become more problematic as its traditional role , as an organizer of land-occupations , shrinks . 
[PER Oliveira  ] cautions that the [ORG MST  ] retains a strong base of 80,000 supporters who received land thanks to its efforts . 
The movement also institutionalized itself , creating schools throughout the country and enjoying a permanent presence at scores of [MISC Brazilian  ] universities , where its followers pursue agrarian studies . 
Finally , [LOC Brazil  ] 's land tenancy problem remains severe , according to [PER Oliveira  ] . 
Land ownership remains highly unequal and poorly documented . 
In a major agricultural state like [LOC Mato Grosso  ] , for example , [PER Oliveira  ] said that between 30-40 percent of the large land owners do not possess clear legal title to their holdings. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG MST  ] hasalso responded with some creativity to the challenges it faces . 
The movement amplified its message in recent years , going beyond advocacy for land reform and launching a fight against big agribusinesses , " transnationals , " and genetically modified foods . 
The [ORG MST  ] also supports [LOC Paraguay  ] 's cause in pushing for a re-negotiation of the [ORG Itaipu Treaty  ] . 
For these reasons , political consultant [PER Thiago de Aragao  ] warns that a smaller [ORG MST  ] could well become more radical and , perhaps , an even more difficult organization for the [ORG GOB  ] . 
Comment: More Red Aprils ------------------------ <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Several factors have contributed to marginalizing the [ORG MST  ] as a political force: President [PER Lula  ] 's election and seven years of rule , the recent success of the [MISC Brazilian  ] economy , and [PER Lula  ] 's [ORG Bolsa Familia  ] program . 
That said , [LOC Brazil  ] 's land tenure system remains riddled with legal problems and the [ORG MST  ] movement is adapting to the new [MISC Brazilian  ] economic and political realities ; branding itself in new ways . 
Though the [ORG MST  ] 's social base has narrowed , it has not disappeared , and the ongoing global economic crisis could add oxygen to the [ORG MST  ] 's cause . 
While the [ORG MST  ] is weaker , there are likely still many more " Red Aprils " in [LOC Brazil  ] 's future. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 .
