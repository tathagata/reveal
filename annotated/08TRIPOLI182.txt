REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Media reports and a statement posted on the quasi-governmental [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] ( [ORG QDF  ] ) website February 24 said [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi , who heads the organization , had personally conducted negotiations with members of the [ORG Libyan Islamic Fighting Group  ] ( [ORG LIFG  ] ) about the possible release from prison of approximately one-third of the cohort of [ORG LIFG  ] members currently imprisoned in [LOC Libya  ] . 
In a meeting with P/E Chief March 3 on other issues , [ORG QDF Executive  ] Director Dr. [PER Yusuf Sawani  ] confirmed the report , noting that negotiations had been ongoing for more than a year . 
He attributed the impetus for the negotiations to a desire by the [ORG GOL  ] to effect " genuine reconciliation " with those imprisoned members of the [ORG LIFG  ] whom it judged to have undergone a " sincere ideological revision " . 
Saying that " no one " wanted to see fellow [MISC Libyans  ] incarcerated indefinitely , he claimed that reconciliation among former enemies was a " natural part " of [LOC Libya  ] 's tribal culture . 
2 . 
( C ) [PER Sawani  ] put the total number of prisoners known to have [ORG LIFG  ] affiliations at 93 and confirmed media reports that about one-third of those could be released if an agreement is reached . 
Saying further rounds of negotiation , with the personal involvement of [LOC Saif  ] al-Islam , were expected to begin " soon " , he stressed that the [ORG QDF  ] and the [ORG GOL  ] are keen " not to force unwelcome conditions " on the individuals being considered for release . 
Emphasizing that the individuals being considered had been judged to have " sincerely " renounced violence as a political adjunct , he said terms of monitoring and rehabilitation were key features of the negotiations . 
The shared goal of the [ORG QDF  ] and [ORG GOL  ] is to gain voluntary agreement by the prisoners to the terms of their release . 
It is expected that prisoners would return to their homes and resume their lives after release , [PER Sawani  ] said . 
There would be a program for monitoring their activities and the [ORG QDF  ] would play " an active role " in promoting their reintegration into society ; however , it is not envisioned that they would be under house arrest . 
3 . 
( C ) Noting that the [ORG QDF  ] realized the planned release will generate controversy in some quarters , including among foreign powers concerned about possible counter-terrorism implications , [PER Sawani  ] said the [ORG QDF  ] understood it had to have " the highest degree of confidence " in the genuine ideological rehabilitation of those being considered for release . 
He stressed that candidates had been closely vetted over a considerable period of time before their names were added to the list used in [PER Saif  ] al-Islam 's negotiations . 
He added that it had been agreed that those released would endorse a public statement renouncing political violence and disassociating themselves from the [ORG LIFG  ] and al-Qaeda . 
( Note: The merger of the [ORG LIFG  ] with al-Qaeda in the Lands of the [LOC Maghreb  ] ( [ORG AQIM  ] ) was announced in November 2007 . 
End note .
