<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 [ORG MADRID  ] 001035 SIPDIS SIPDIS DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/WE AND WHA/CCA E.O. 12958: [LOC DECL:  ] 04/21/2016 TAGS: <a href='/tag/ETRD_0.html'>ETRD</a> <a href='/tag/ETTC_0.html'>ETTC</a> <a href='/tag/PREL_0.html'>PREL</a> <a href='/tag/CU_0.html'>CU</a> <a href='/tag/SP_0.html'>SP</a> SUBJECT: SPAIN/CUBA: TITLE III OF [ORG LIBERTAD ACT REF: STATE  ] 57782 Classified By: DCM Bob [LOC Manzanares  ] ; Reason 1.4 ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [LOC Spain  ] is believed to be the largest foreign investor in [LOC Cuba  ] , though [MISC Spanish  ] companies avoid publishing precise data out of concern that such information will be used to further [LOC U.S.  ] enforcement actions under the [ORG Libertad Act  ] . 
[LOC Cuba  ] is the third-largest market for [LOC Spain  ] in [LOC Latin America  ] , after [LOC Mexico  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] , and [MISC Spanish  ] exports to [LOC Cuba  ] in 2005 were valued at $488 million . 
[LOC Spain  ] is also [LOC Cuba  ] 's second-largest supplier of non-petroleum goods , accounting for approximately 13 percent of [MISC Cuban  ] imports . 
However , the [ORG Zapatero  ] government has not reinstated the provision of risk insurance through the " [ORG Spanish Credit Insurance Company  ] " ( [ORG CESCE  ] ) for sales to and investments in [LOC Cuba  ] ; [ORG CESCE  ] suspended insurance for [LOC Cuba  ] due to delays in [LOC Cuba  ] 's repayment of $600 million in debts . 
[MISC Spanish  ] analysts believe two-way trade between [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] would increase by $200 million if [ORG CESCE  ] resumed insurance coverage for business deals with [LOC Cuba.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Although there is no indication that [ORG CESCE  ] insurance will be resumed in the near future , both [MISC Spanish  ] businesses and the [MISC Spanish  ] government believe [LOC Spain  ] has important long-term commercial interests in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
This perception , combined with strong cultural and family bonds between [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] , limits [LOC Spain  ] 's readiness to confront the [PER Castro  ] regime . 
There is also broad-based [MISC Spanish  ] antagonism towards the [ORG Libertad Act  ] and other [LOC Cuba  ] sanctions . 
This antagonism cuts across party lines ; both the ruling [ORG Socialist Party  ] and the opposition [ORG Popular Party  ] would likely seek retaliatory action by the [ORG EU  ] in the event of an enforcement action against a [ORG Spanish Company  ] under the [ORG Libertad Act.  ] //RESPONSES TO NSC TASKING// <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Responses below are keyed to questions posed in reftel , paragraph 5: What is the nature of [MISC Spanish  ] investments in [LOC Cuba  ] ? : - The " [ORG Association of Spanish Companies  ] in [LOC Cuba  ] " ( [ORG AEEC  ] ) represents over 170 [MISC Spanish  ] businesses that trade with or invest in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
[MISC Spanish  ] companies , mostly small and medium sized businesses , account for approximately 25 percent of foreign investment in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
These companies are well aware of the potential for [LOC U.S.  ] legal action against them under the [ORG Libertad Act  ] and are careful to obscure information related to their investments in [LOC Cuba  ] .

We have no information regarding current operations in [LOC Cuba  ] by these companies. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) - Are there any bilateral trade agreements between [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] ? : There is a bilateral " [ORG Commission  ] on [ORG Economic-Industrial Cooperation  ] " between [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] that is intended to promote bilateral trade and investment . 
The work of the [ORG Commission  ] has been suspended for several years due to disputes over [LOC Cuba  ] 's non-payment of debt to [MISC Spanish  ] entities and other differences. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) - Are there any exchange programs between [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] ? : -- There are no exchange programs between [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] . 
However , [MISC Spanish  ] regional governments have substantial assistance programs in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
Over 90 percent of [MISC Spanish  ] development assistance to [LOC Cuba  ] comes from regional governments , with less than 10 percent provided by the central government . 
Such assistance is channeled primarily through the [MISC Cuban  ] government , and to a lesser degree through multilateral aid organizations. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) - Has [LOC Spain  ] worked to promote the advancement of democracy and human rights in [LOC Cuba  ] ? : -- The [MISC Spanish  ] government supports democratic objectives in [LOC Cuba  ] , but , unlike the [ORG USG  ] , believes that when [PER Castro  ] passes from the scene , a succession is preferable to a rapid transition . 
[LOC Spain  ] 's view is conditioned by the experience of its own democratic transition ( which took place over more than five years ) and its fear that rapid change may destabilize [LOC Cuba  ] and lead to a humanitarian disaster . 
As a result , [LOC Spain  ] is focused on building relationships with potential successors to [PER Castro  ] , believing [LOC Spain  ] will be able to steer them in a positive direction after [PER Castro  ] 's death . 
This outlook limits [LOC Spain  ] 's willingness to take a tough stand against the [PER Castro  ] regime . 
In response to [ORG USG  ] suggestions of coordination on [LOC Cuba  ] , [LOC Spain  ] has indicated a desire to coordinate transition planning with the [ORG USG  ] . 
These discussions form part of a broader effort to strengthen [MISC U.S.-Spain  ] coordination in [LOC Latin America  ] . 
-- Within the [ORG EU  ] , [LOC Spain  ] is unlikely to deviate from its support for continued engagement with the [MISC Cuban  ] government , though the [MISC Cuban  ] regime 's refusal to ease political conditions in response to the suspension of the [ORG EU  ] 's restrictive measures has tempered [LOC Spain  ] 's readiness to advocate closer [ORG EU  ] relations with [LOC Havana  ] . 
On April 22 , Foreign Minister [PER Miguel Angel Moratinos  ] stated [LOC Spain  ] 's position that there should be no " reversal " in [ORG EU  ] policy towards [LOC Cuba  ] , though " [LOC Cuba  ] should take into account that it has to go further , and that if it makes a positive gesture we shall be able to improve its relations with the [ORG EU  ] . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 .

The primary purpose of his visit was to attend [ORG MADRID  ] 00001035 003 OF 003 peace talks in [LOC Havana  ] between [MISC Colombian  ] [ORG ELN  ] guerrillas and the [MISC Colombian  ] government , but [PER Leon  ] also met with [MISC Cuban  ] Foreign Minister [PER Felipe Perez Roque  ] as well as with dissident leaders .
