[PER SALEH  ] ON CT ASSISTANCE , AIRPORT SECURITY , AND [PER SA'ADA  ] --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) In a January 31 meeting with President [PER Saleh  ] , the [ORG Department 's Coordinator for Counter-Terrorism  ] , Ambassador [PER Daniel Benjamin  ] , congratulated [PER Saleh  ] on the success of the [LOC London  ] meeting and suggested that stability in [LOC Yemen  ] can be achieved only through a dual focus on security and development . 
He commended [PER Saleh  ] on actions the [ORG ROYG  ] has taken in recent weeks against [ORG AQAP  ] elements in [LOC Yemen  ] and assured [PER Saleh  ] that he could count on continued operational support and intelligence sharing from the [LOC U.S.  ] President [PER Saleh  ] said he was satisfied with counter-terrorism ( CT ) assistance to date and with Secretary [PER Clinton  ] 's speech at the [ORG London Conference  ] , but said he " would like to be more satisfied in the future " and appealed for the acceleration of additional support , specifically citing helicopters and vehicles with [MISC IED-jamming  ] devices . 
Describing [MISC Americans  ] as " hot-blooded and hasty when you need us , " but " cold-blooded and [MISC British  ] when we need you , " he asked for a " moderate blood temperature " and measured approach . 
( [PER Note: Also  ] present were Deputy Prime Minister for [ORG Defense and Security Rashad  ] al-Alimi , [ORG National Security Bureau  ] Director [PER Ali al-'Anisi  ] , and [ORG Political Security Organization  ] ( [ORG PSO  ] ) Director [PER Ghalib Mutahir  ] al-Gamish , with whom [PER Benjamin  ] met separately after the conversation with the President .

( [LOC S/NF  ] ) Ambassador [PER Benjamin  ] reiterated the [ORG USG  ] desire to ensure that no international terrorist attack originates again from [LOC Yemen  ] . 
He said the [ORG USG  ] wants to help the [ORG ROYG  ] strengthen screening procedures at all of [LOC Yemen  ] 's international airports , and establish a mechanism for sharing information on passengers traveling via air to and from [LOC Yemen  ] as well as foreign nationals who have come to [LOC Yemen  ] to study at language or religious institutions . 
When approached with the upcoming [ORG Transportation Security Administration/Anti-Terrorism Assistance  ] ( [ORG TSA/ATA  ] ) visit , [PER Saleh  ] agreed to the idea but deferred to his [ORG Supreme Security Committee  ] ( [PER Alimi  ] , et al ) on the details . 
In the follow-on meeting , [PER Alimi  ] and 'Anisi both concurred with the upcoming [MISC ATA/TSA  ] visit and expressed support for increasing airport security . 
'Anisi , however , had reservations about sharing information on foreign students in [LOC Yemen  ] , and complained that the [ORG USG  ] request was too broad . 
( Comment: According to [MISC GRPO  ] reporting , the [ORG ROYG  ] is willing to share information with the [ORG USG  ] on [MISC American  ] students in [LOC Yemen  ] and would likewise share information with other embassies about their nationals . 
While [MISC Western  ] governments would presumably share information among themselves , this system would still leave intelligence gaps about non-Western countries such as [LOC Nigeria  ] .

( [LOC S/NF  ] ) Citing [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] 's decision to suspend its military operations in [PER Sa'ada  ] and [PER Abdul Malik  ] al-Houthi 's public acceptance of the [ORG ROYG  ] 's conditions for a ceasefire , Ambassador [PER Benjamin  ] asked [PER Saleh  ] if he saw an end to the fighting . 
[PER Saleh  ] dismissed these points , arguing that the [MISC Saudis  ] gave a ceasefire ultimatum to the [MISC Houthis  ] , and will resume fighting in two weeks if the ceasefire is unfulfilled . 
He called the [MISC Houthis  ] " liars " and declared that they would violate the six conditions of the ceasefire . 
He indicated that the [ORG ROYG  ] had no intention of agreeing to a ceasefire at this time. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) In a visit to [LOC Yemen  ] Special Operation Forces ( [ORG YSOF  ] ) [ORG Headquarters  ] , Ambassador [PER Benjamin  ] was treated to a display of military equipment and briefed by [ORG YSOF  ] Chief of [ORG Staff Brigadier General  ] [PER Ahmad Dahan  ] on [ORG YSOF  ] activities . 
Ambassador [PER Benjamin  ] emphasized common security interests and congratulated [MISC Yemeni  ] forces for their role in recent operations . 
[ORG Dahan  ] reiterated the request for helicopters and asked for communications systems and additional training courses . 
He lauded [MISC Yemeni  ] operations as having a great effect on [ORG AQAP  ] elements , and indicated that the operations were possible only due to the exchange of intelligence . 
FM [PER QIRBI  ] LOOKING FORWARD TO [LOC RIYADH  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) In a separate meeting , Foreign Minister Dr. [PER Abu Bakr  ] al-Qirbi agreed the [ORG London Conference  ] was a success and expressed hope that the February follow-up meeting in [LOC Riyadh  ] would help determine concrete steps to move forward . 
[PER Qirbi  ] agreed that a smaller group , focusing on [ORG Gulf Cooperation Council  ] ( [ORG GCC  ] ) member countries , rather than a broader donor group , would be more constructive . 
[PER Qirbi  ] said that the [ORG ROYG  ] wanted to focus on the [MISC Top Ten Economic Reform  ] Priorities over the course of the next year , but would need donor assistance to accomplish these goals . 
He expressed support for discussion at the [MISC GCC-hosted  ] meeting of funding for an extremist rehabilitation center , indicating that an educational institute with a long-term plan would do much to counter radicalization and address issues of poverty and unemployment , particularly in areas where [ORG AQAP  ] has a hold . 
[PER Qirbi  ] and other [ORG ROYG  ] officials expressed support for [LOC US  ] intervention with [ORG GCC  ] member countries in an attempt to gain financial support for a rehabilitation center as an expression of regional support for [LOC Yemen  ] 's stability . 
[ORG EMBASSY LAND DISPUTE  ] -------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The [ORG Supreme Security Committee  ] was familiar with the [ORG Embassy  ] 's struggle to acquire land , and said they were willing to act on the [ORG Embassy  ] 's behalf . 
Foreign Minister [PER Qirbi  ] said that he had been in communication with Minister of [ORG Religious Endowments Judge  ] [PER Hamoud Hitar  ] , who indicated the [ORG ROYG  ] 's readiness for the purchase and resolution of a dispute over ownership . 
[PER Alimi  ] said that Deputy Foreign Minister [PER Mohyadeen al-Dhabi  ] was following up and had secured the full cooperation of the [ORG Ministry of Religious Endowments  ] . 
[PER Alimi  ] encouraged Ambassador Seche to sign the contract for the land , professing that he would personally guarantee the investment . 
( Comment: In a follow-on conversation on February 3 , [PER Alimi  ] repeated his assurance to the Ambassador that the [ORG ROYG  ] is prepared to provide for the security of the proposed housing site both during and after construction . 
He suggested that the Ambassador meet with 'Anisi , who President [PER Saleh  ] has charged with overseeing the process , to discuss final details of the deal , including our timeframe for beginning construction . 
The Ambassador will try to see 'Anisi next week for this purpose .
