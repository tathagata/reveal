( C ) Summary . 
[LOC Spain  ] is both a significant target of [MISC Islamic  ] terrorist groups and a major logistical hub for [MISC Islamic  ] extremist groups operating across the globe . 
The March 11 , 2004 train bombings made [LOC Madrid  ] the site of the worst terrorist attack in the history of the [ORG EU  ] and triggered the second major crackdown in three years against [MISC Spain-based  ] [MISC Islamic  ] terrorist groups . 
Historically , [MISC Spain-based  ] extremists have tended to be older ( 30-40 years ) , first-generation immigrants with a history of militant activity in their home countries . 
The first [MISC Islamists  ] did not establish themselves in [LOC Spain  ] until the late 1980s and early 1990s , coming mainly from [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Algeria  ] . 
The influx of large numbers of [MISC North African  ] immigrants is changing the profile of [MISC Spain-based  ] [MISC Islamic  ] extremists , creating a large pool of young , alienated men available for recruitment. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Extremist groups active in [LOC Spain  ] tend to be decentralized , collaborating on an ad hoc basis and united more by friendships , family ties , and loyalty to the global jihadist cause than by membership in any given terrorist organization . 
While [MISC Spain-based  ] groups at first focused on organizing themselves and providing logistical support to extremists in other countries , they became increasingly aggressive after the September 11 attacks and the subsequent [ORG GOS  ] crackdown on [MISC Islamist  ] terrorist cells in [LOC Spain  ] . 
[LOC Spain  ] 's withdrawal of troops from [LOC Iraq  ] does not appear to have reduced the desire of extremists to strike at [MISC Spanish  ] targets and [MISC Spanish  ] authorities , long focused on [MISC Basque  ] terrorism , have shifted gears to deal with the growing threat posed by [MISC Islamic  ] extremists . 
Police have disrupted multiple terrorist networks over the last year , including a group that funneled suicide bombers from [LOC Spain  ] to [LOC Iraq  ] , and are currently holding approximately 130 suspects in connection with [MISC Islamic  ] terrorist activities . 
In July , the [ORG GOS  ] concluded a four-year investigation and trial of 24 members of a local al-Qa'ida cell ; the Court is expected to render a decision September <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
There are at least 300 suspected [MISC Islamist  ] terrorists or logistical operatives in [LOC Spain  ] and the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] 's senior terrorism adviser believes there may be as many as 1,000 . 
[MISC Spain-based  ] terrorists are believed to target local [ORG USG  ] interests ; for example , one of the [LOC Madrid  ] train bombers was spotted conducting surveillance of the [MISC Embassy  ] building one year prior to the train attacks . 
The rapid growth of the [MISC Moroccan  ] immigrant community , combined with worrisome trends among [MISC Spain-based  ] extremist groups , suggest that [LOC Spain  ] is likely to remain an active front in the war on terror for many years to come . 
End Summary. //THE [MISC ISLAMIC  ] COMMUNITY IN SPAIN// <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) There are an estimated 600,000-800,000 [MISC Muslims  ] in [LOC Spain  ] , and possibly up to one million , the majority of them recent immigrants from [LOC Morocco  ] . 
The recent upsurge in illegal immigration makes a more accurate figure difficult to establish . 
Not surprisingly , the growth of [LOC Spain  ] 's [MISC Islamic  ] population has been especially robust in its [MISC North African  ] enclaves of [LOC Ceuta  ] and [LOC Melilla  ] , where a [ORG GOS  ] report forecast that [MISC Muslims  ] would become a majority within the next several years ( and warned that only 40 percent of residents considered themselves " pro-Spanish . 
" ) Prior to the arrival of large numbers of [MISC North African  ] immigrants in the late 1990s , [LOC Spain  ] 's [MISC Muslim  ] population was comprised of immigrants from [LOC Pakistan  ] and the [LOC Middle East  ] , as well as a growing number of [MISC Spanish-born  ] converts to [MISC Islam  ] . 
[MISC Spanish  ] converts , numbering some 20,000 , tend to gather and to worship at their own institutions . 
Converts are well represented in [LOC Spain  ] 's leading [MISC Islamic  ] institutions including the [ORG Islamic Commision of Spain  ] ( [ORG CIE  ] ) , which serves as the official interface between the [MISC Islamic  ] community and the [MISC Spanish  ] government . 
The [ORG CIE  ] includes major organizations such as the [ORG Islamic Federation of Spain  ] and the [ORG Union of Islamic Communities  ] in [LOC Spain  ] . 
Over 240 mosques and 64 religious communities are officially registered with the [ORG CIE  ] ; approximately 160 mosques in [LOC Spain  ] do not belong to the [ORG CIE  ] . 
Immigrants rights organization " [ORG ATIME  ] " is not a religious group , but most of its members are [MISC Moroccan  ] [MISC Muslims  ] . 
[ORG ATIME  ] recently angered [ORG CIE  ] leaders by proposing the creation of a new [MISC Islamic  ] council to incorporate the views of more recent arrivals in [LOC Spain  ] and establish controls to monitor against the teaching of extremist ideologies by imams ( implying that the [ORG CIE  ] does not adequately represent the views of the growing [MISC Moroccan  ] community or police its own members ) . 
Observers believe that no more than 15 percent of [MISC Spanish Muslims  ] regularly attend religious services , though many likely attend services at informal houses of worship , known as " oratorios . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) Until now , the broader [MISC Muslim  ] community in [LOC Spain  ] has been of little importance to the activities of local extremist groups . 
During the 1990s , the vast majority of [MISC Spain-based  ] [MISC Islamist  ] radicals were recent immigrants with a history of militant activity in their home countries . 
Very few were second-generation immigrants or [MISC Spanish  ] converts to [MISC Islam  ] . 
[MISC Islamic  ] extremists coalesced in [MISC Spanish  ] mosques and continue to use them to distribute propaganda and scout for new recruits , but they have had only limited success in using mosques to tap into the broader [MISC Muslim  ] community . 
Authorities believe [MISC Islamist  ] radicals prefer informal religious instruction groups as a way to attract new members and maintain group cohesion rather than working in mosques where they are vulnerable to surveillance by police and other mosque members. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) [LOC Spain  ] 's largest mosque is co-located with the [ORG Islamic Cultural Center  ] in [LOC Madrid  ] and is popularly known as the " [MISC M-30 Mosque  ] " because of its proximity to the [MISC M-30  ] highway , a principal artery through [LOC Madrid  ] . 
The [MISC M-30 Mosque  ] is funded by the [ORG Government of Saudi Arabia  ] . 
Though the imams at the [MISC M-30 Mosque  ] are considered moderate by [MISC Spanish  ] authorities , suspected extremists are known to attend services there . 
Prosecutors are investigating the former director of [MISC M-30 Mosque  ] for his alleged role in transferring funds to a suspicious NGO ; the [ORG USG  ] is assisting with this investigation . 
Separately , three imams from the [MISC Catalan  ] region were the key figures in a network that facilitated the movement of jihadists from [LOC Spain  ] to [LOC Iraq  ] to undertake terrorist acts against [ORG Coalition and Iraqi Government  ] targets . 
Their mosques served as recruitment and indoctrination centers for terrorist volunteers . 
This network was dismantled by police in June , 2005 . 
In addition to recruiting through mosques , [MISC Islamist  ] radicals distribute propaganda at [LOC Koranic  ] schools , halal butcher shops , and [MISC Islamic  ] centers. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [MISC Islamic  ] extremists are not connected to any political organization in [LOC Spain  ] . 
There are no [MISC Islamist  ] ( or even [MISC Islamic  ] ) political parties that could be used as a cover for jihadist activities . 
This may begin to change as the burgeoning population of [MISC North African  ] immigrants , especially [MISC Moroccans  ] , begins to establish its own institutions in [LOC Spain  ] . 
There are no significant [MISC Spain-based  ] [MISC Islamic  ] extremist publications , though many [MISC Spanish  ] extremists have connections to publications elsewhere in [LOC Europe  ] , such as [ORG London.  ] //ISLAMIC TERRORISM - A RECENT ARRIVAL IN SPAIN// <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Though [LOC Spain  ] was the site of several [MISC Islamic  ] terrorist attacks during the 1980s , including a 1985 bombing by [MISC Islamic  ] Jihad near [LOC Torrejon Air Base  ] outside of [LOC Madrid  ] that killed 18 and wounded 82 , there are few indications of extremist groups operating from [LOC Spain  ] prior to the mid 1990s . 
The first [MISC Islamic  ] terrorist organizations were formed by [MISC Syrian  ] members of the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] who had fled repression by the Asad regime and settled in [LOC Spain  ] in the late 1980s . 
Police believe [MISC Palestinian  ] radical [PER Anwar Adnan Mohamed Salah  ] , [LOC AKA  ] " [PER Chej Salah  ] , " and [MISC Syrian  ] al-Qa'ida member and propagandist [PER Mustafa Setmarian  ] , [LOC AKA  ] " [PER Abu Mus'ab  ] al-Suri , " played a critical role in organizing [MISC Syrian  ] exiles in [LOC Spain  ] to support the international jihadist movement . 
In 1994 , [PER Setmarian  ] moved to [LOC London  ] to work with the [MISC Algerian  ] [ORG Armed Islamic Group  ] ( [ORG GIA  ] ) publication " al-Ansar " and [PER Salah  ] went to [LOC Pakistan  ] to work with al-Qa'ida leader [PER Abu Zubaydah  ] in funneling recruits to terrorist training camps in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
From 1995 until his 2001 arrest , [PER Imad Eddin Barakat Yarkas  ] led the [MISC Syrian  ] group in [LOC Spain  ] , during which period this cell expanded its activities and aided the development of other [MISC Islamist  ] extremist groups . 
[PER Yarkas  ] and many of the other [MISC Syrian  ] extremists were relatively educated , prosperous , and projected the appearance of being well established in [LOC Spain  ] . 
They reportedly raised terrorism funds by working with [MISC Moroccan  ] criminals engaged in fraud , robbery , and theft of mobile phones. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) As [MISC Syrian  ] extremists were becoming more organized to lend support to international jihadist movements , [MISC Algerian  ] [ORG GIA  ] members began arriving in [LOC Spain  ] in significant numbers , fleeing capture by the [MISC Algerian  ] authorities . 
[ORG GIA  ] members settled in eastern [LOC Spain  ] , mostly near [LOC Alicante  ] and [LOC Valencia  ] , which have ferry connections to [MISC Algerian  ] ports . 
Many [ORG GIA  ] members in [LOC Spain  ] acted in a support capacity for [ORG GIA  ] fighters in [LOC Algeria  ] , though some moved on to work for international jihadist causes . 
The [ORG Salafist Group  ] for Call and Combat ( [ORG GSPC  ] ) , which eclipsed the [ORG GIA  ] in [LOC Spain  ] as elsewhere , was detected by 2001 and in June of that year [MISC Spanish  ] police arrested [ORG GSPC  ] member [PER Mohamed Benshakria  ] , who had fled [LOC Germany  ] to avoid arrest in connection with the " [MISC Meliani  ] cell " that had planned terrorist attacks in [LOC Strasbourg.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [MISC South Asian  ] extremists also arrived in [LOC Spain  ] , with most settling in the large [MISC Pakistani  ] communities in [LOC Barcelona  ] , [LOC Bibao  ] , [LOC Santander  ] , and [MISC Logrono  ] . 
[MISC Pakistani Islamist  ] radicals appear to play a mainly logistical role , particularly in providing false documents and in transferring funds . 
[MISC Spanish  ] authorities are concerned that extremist elements may have insinuated themselves into [MISC Pakistani  ] communities in the [MISC Catalan  ] and [ORG La Rioja  ] regions in order to provide support and raise funds for militant Pakistani/Kashmiri organizations such as [ORG Lashkar-i-Taiba  ] , [PER Harakat-ul Mujahideen  ] , [PER Jaish-e Mohammad  ] , [PER Lashkar-e Jangvi  ] , and [MISC Jihad-e-Islami  ] al-Alami . 
Recent reports indicate that [LOC Dubai  ] is a key financial hub for [MISC Spain-based  ] [MISC Pakistani  ] hawala organizations , including those hawalas with links to crime and/or terrorism . 
Police arrested 10 [MISC Pakistani  ] nationals on fraud charges in [LOC Barcelona  ] in September 2004 and subsequently discovered indications that the group had apparently funneled money to senior al-Qa'ida figures in [LOC Pakistan  ] and had made suspicious videos of [LOC Barcelona  ] landmarks . 
The group remains in detention. //MOROCCANS ARRIVE// <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The most important recent development in the local [MISC Islamic  ] extremist community has been the influx of [MISC Moroccan  ] radicals . 
They arrived in the 1990s along with tens of thousands of [MISC Moroccan  ] economic migrants , who have become by far the largest [MISC Muslim  ] immigrant community in [LOC Spain  ] ( 500,000 [MISC Moroccans  ] compared to approximately 40,000 [MISC Algerians  ] , the next-largest group ) . 
While some of the more important [MISC Moroccan  ] extremists matched their [MISC Syrian  ] and [MISC Algerian  ] counterparts in terms of first-hand experience operating against their government , many low-level supporters were only recruited after their arrival in [LOC Spain  ] . 
[MISC Moroccan  ] extremists tend to be less well off and most are involved in criminal activity , such as drug trafficking ( primarily hashish ) and/or fraud . 
Since the September 11 attacks in the [LOC U.S.  ] , the [LOC Casablanca  ] bombings in [LOC Morocco  ] , the interventions in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] , and the dismantlement of the [PER Barakat Yarkas  ] network , [MISC Moroccan  ] extremists appear to have moved to the forefront of the jihadist community in [LOC Spain  ] , at least in numerical terms . 
The large and growing [MISC Moroccan  ] community provides [MISC Islamic  ] extremist recruiters in [LOC Spain  ] with an ample supply of poor , alienated young men and access to funds from drug trafficking and other illegal activities. //TERRORIST GROUPS ACTIVE IN SPAIN// <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The extremist community in [LOC Spain  ] is decentralized , with few national or institutional barriers and frequent ad hoc collaboration among radicals from different organizations . 
Few local organizations emphasize themselves as a unit and organization names appear to be unimportant . 
However , many extremists in [LOC Spain  ] are affiliated to some degree with organized jihadist groups in other countries . 
In total , police believe there are at least 300 [MISC Islamic  ] radicals active in [LOC Spain  ] and [ORG Ministry of Interior Senior  ] Adviser on Terrorism Professor [PER Fernando Reinares  ] estimates there may be as many as 1,000 such extremists . 
[MISC Islamic  ] terrorist organizations with a presence in [LOC Spain  ] include: -- al-Qa'ida: [PER Barakat Yarkas  ] and other members of the [MISC Syrian  ] group had direct links to al-Qa'ida . 
[ORG Barakat Yarkas  ] is charged with murder for allegedly organizing [PER Mohamed Atta  ] 's crucial meeting with [PER Ramzi Binalshibh  ] during [PER Atta  ] 's final preparations for the September 11 attacks . 
A decision is expected in his case on September 20 . 
Other extremist organizations in [LOC Spain  ] draw inspiration from al-Qa'ida , but there is no clear indication that they act under instruction from the leadership of the organization . 
-- [MISC Moroccan  ] [ORG Islamic Combat Group  ] ( [ORG GICM  ] ) : Police have drawn connections between terrorists involved in the [LOC Madrid  ] train bombings and the [ORG GICM  ] figures that carried out the 2003 [LOC Casablanca  ] attacks , but it appears that the [LOC Madrid  ] bombings were organized and executed at the local level rather than under instruction from the [ORG GICM  ] leadership . 
Senior [ORG GICM  ] figure [PER Hassan al-Haski  ] was arrested in the [LOC Canary Islands  ] in December 2004 for his alleged role in the March 11 train bombings . 
-- [ORG Salafist Group  ] for Call and Combat ( [ORG GSPC  ] ) : According to [MISC Spanish  ] authorities , [ORG GSPC  ] members in [LOC Spain  ] appear to act with a high degree of autonomy from their leadership in [LOC Algeria  ] . 
Many suspected [ORG GSPC  ] members seem to be acting in support of local and global jihadist causes rather than being dedicated to the conflict in [LOC Algeria  ] . 
-- [ORG Armed Islamic Group  ] ( [ORG GIA  ] ) : [ORG GIA  ] was an important force during the formative period of [MISC Islamist  ] extremist groups in [LOC Spain  ] in the early 1990s , but no longer maintains a significant presence in the country , since many [ORG GIA  ] members have been arrested , abandoned the [ORG GIA  ] to join the [ORG GSPC  ] , or joined other local [MISC Islamist  ] causes . 
March 11 train bombing suspect [PER Allekema Lamari  ] served five years in a [MISC Spanish  ] prison on charges of being a [ORG GIA  ] member . 
-- [PER Ansar-al-Islam: Ansar-al-Islam  ] does not have a formal presence in [LOC Spain  ] , but a [MISC Spain-based  ] organization affiliated with the group was responsible for recruiting suicide bombers to attack coalition forces in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[MISC Spanish  ] authorities dismantled the cell in June , 2005 , jailing eight and holding seven for deportation proceedings . 
Three of those detained were imams at [LOC Barcelona-area  ] mosques . 
The cell reportedly succeeded in sending [PER Mohamed Afalah  ] , an extremist involved in the [LOC Madrid  ] train bombings , to [LOC Iraq  ] where he may have carried out a suicide attack against [MISC Iraqi  ] government or Coalition forces in May , 2005 . 
-- [ORG Salafiya Jihadiya: Formed  ] in the early 1990s by [MISC Moroccan  ] veterans of the anti-Soviet struggle in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [ORG Salafiya Jihadiya  ] supported or inspired many [MISC Moroccan  ] jihadists , including several that worked with the organization in [LOC Morocco  ] and later moved to [LOC Spain  ] . 
-- [ORG Hizballah: Hizballah  ] ( which is not officially recognized as a terrorist organization by [ORG EU  ] countries but is monitored by the [MISC Spanish  ] security services ) is believed to have a small presence in [LOC Spain  ] in a fund-raising and logistical capacity . 
[MISC Spanish  ] officials judge the risk of a [PER Hizballah  ] attack in [LOC Spain  ] to be very low. //SHIFTING FACE OF EXTREMISM IN SPAIN// <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Nearly all known or suspected [MISC Islamic  ] extremists in [LOC Spain  ] are first-generation immigrants , most of whom have a history of religious fanaticism in their home countries or a close personal connection to a [MISC Muslim  ] extremist . 
They are typically older than extremists in other countries , with the majority aged 30-40 and very few below the age of 25 . 
As noted above , many of the first [MISC Islamists  ] to take up activities in [LOC Spain  ] had a good education and many had good jobs and were considered well integrated into [MISC Spanish  ] society . 
That remains true for many among the second wave of [MISC Spain-based  ] extremists , including [MISC Moroccans  ] involved in the March 11 attacks . 
However , among [MISC North Africans  ] suspected of involvement in terrorist activity there also many who are poor or unemployed and many have criminal records for drug trafficking , robbery , or fraud . 
The growing pool of disaffected young [MISC North Africans  ] is likely to become the major recruiting pool for extremist organizers over the coming years. //IDEOLOGY ERASES ORGANIZATIONAL BOUNDARIES// <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [MISC Spain-based Islamist  ] extremists are strongly influenced by the " [ORG Takfir Wal Hijra  ] " doctrine , which justifies the use of illegal proceeds to fund jihadist operations and accepts non-Muslim practices such as drinking alcohol and drug trafficking as a cover for extremist activities . 
Several of the [LOC Madrid  ] train bombers reportedly followed this doctrine , engaging in drug trafficking and other criminal activity to finance the March 11 , 2004 attacks . 
At an ideological level , the cells that carried out the train bombings and other groups seem driven by general support for the global jihadist cause and by their Salafist religious beliefs rather than focused on a particular theater of that struggle. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Broad acceptance of these operational and ideological doctrines among [MISC Spain-based  ] extremists promotes a high degree of cross-fertilization and ad hoc cooperation , with most organizational , ethnic , and regional differences subordinated to greater ideological objectives . 
Family relationships and friendships are key to recruitment efforts . 
Many senior extremist figures are also bound by shared experience in terrorist training camps in [LOC Afghanistan  ] or elsewhere , or by shared association with highly-regarded jihadist veterans . 
Organization names appear unimportant , with shifting groups of [MISC Islamic  ] extremist collaborators adopting different names for different projects . 
For example , members of [MISC Barakat Yarkas'  ] [MISC Syrian  ] network called themselves the " [ORG Islamic Alliance  ] " and then " Soldiers of [LOC Allah  ] , " but never displayed much interest in a particular name. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The decentralization of [MISC Spanish Islamic  ] extremists was clearly seen in the network that carried out the [LOC Madrid  ] train bombings . 
The group included mainly [MISC Moroccans  ] , but also [MISC Algerians  ] , [MISC Egyptians  ] , [MISC Tunisians  ] and other nationalities from a variety of extremist organizations . 
Police believe that at least three distinct groups came together to carry out the attacks . 
One group , based in the [LOC Madrid  ] district of [LOC Lavapies  ] , was led by [PER Jamal Zougam  ] , a [MISC Moroccan  ] national resident in [LOC Spain  ] and an associate of jailed al-Qa'ida figure [MISC Barakat Yarkas  ] . 
A second group was directed by [MISC Moroccan  ] national [PER Jamal Ahmidan  ] ( [ORG AKA  ] " El [MISC Chino  ] " ) from [LOC Madrid  ] 's [PER Villaverde  ] district . 
The third group was led by Sarhane [PER Ben Abdelmajid Fakhet  ] ( [ORG AKA  ] Sarhane " The [MISC Tunisian  ] " ) and contained members of various nationalities . 
Other actors included [MISC Barakat Yarkas  ] associate [PER Amer Azizi  ] , who remains at large and is believed to have established the link between the Serhane and [PER Zougam  ] cells . 
The various conspirators were brought together by common associations with [MISC Islamic  ] extremist organizers , intermarriage among their families , and worship at centers such as [LOC Madrid  ] 's [LOC Villaverde Mosque  ] . 
The mix of associations has slowed the progress of the investigation into the train bombings . 
Despite having accumulated a mass of information regarding planning for the bombings , police remain unable to pinpoint precisely who led the attacks . 
It appears likely that there was no single leader , but a consortium of central actors who organized the plot and sought specialized assistance as required ( for example , for manufacturing the bombs used in the attacks ) . //DRUG TRAFFICKING - LOW-TECH TERRORIST FINANCING// <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The March 11 , 2004 [LOC Madrid  ] train bombings were financed with the proceeds from drug sales carried out by [PER Jamal Ahmidan  ] ( El [MISC Chino  ] ) and others . 
Investigators found substantial quantities of drug money during searches of the properties of March 11 plotters and ample evidence linking low-level drug dealers to the cell that planned and executed the train bombings . 
The subsequent arrest of a separate extremist cell comprised primarily of [MISC Moroccans  ] imprisoned on drug charges , as well as the substantial criminal records of [MISC North African  ] immigrants detained in connection with yet another network that sent suicide bombers to [LOC Iraq  ] , suggest that drug trafficking has become the primary financing vehicle for [MISC Spain-based  ] jihadists . 
This trend substantially expands the pool of persons with possible involvement in support of [MISC Islamic  ] extremist activities and diminishes the capacity of [LOC Spain  ] 's financial intelligence unit to use the formal banking system to track the activities of suspected jihadists . 
Mission elements are aware of this danger and work with police to track drug arrests of [MISC North African  ] suspects . 
In just the period between April 1 and July 31 of 2005 , [MISC Spanish  ] police reported 246 arrests of [MISC Moroccan  ] nationals on drug charges , mostly hashish trafficking . 
Once in the [MISC Spanish  ] prison system , these detainees become a priority target for [MISC Islamic  ] extremist recruiters . 
With [LOC Spain  ] as the major portal for cocaine and hashish bound for the [ORG Western European market  ] , drug trafficking will likely remain a lucrative source of funds ( and recruits ) over the long term for terrorist groups operating in the country and/or supporting jihadist causes overseas. //THREAT TO [LOC U.S.  ] INTERESTS IN SPAIN// <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [MISC Spain-based Islamic  ] terrorist groups target [LOC U.S.  ] interests in the country , at least for surveillance purposes . 
The sizable extremist community and insular nature of large segments of the [MISC Muslim  ] immigrant population make it difficult to monitor against such threats and/or detect them in the planning stages , but specific threats have been identified in recent years . 
Approximately one year before the 2004 [LOC Madrid  ] train bombings , the [ORG RSO Surveillance Detection Team  ] photographed an unidentified subject conducting surveillance of the [MISC Embassy  ] ( REF I ) . 
During the course of the train bombing investigation , [ORG RSO  ] discovered that the subject photographed by the detection team was Said [PER Berraj  ] , a key planner of the train bombings who escaped the [MISC Spanish  ] police sweep and remains at large . 
Separately , [ORG RSO  ] blocked an attempt by [MISC Al-Jazeera  ] journalist [PER Taysir Alouny  ] , who is on trial for alleged membership in the [MISC Barakat Yarkas  ] al-Qa'ida cell , to enter the November 2004 [MISC Embassy  ] election night party at a [LOC Madrid  ] hotel , ostensibly to cover the event as a journalist . 
[PER Alouny  ] was out on bail at the time , but was subsequently re-arrested by [MISC Spanish  ] authorities . 
Mission personnel believe that the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Embassy  ] likely is a prime target for [MISC Spain-based Islamic  ] terrorists. //SPANISH RESPONSE TO [ORG ISLAMIC EXTREMISM//  ] <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) Despite [LOC Spain  ] 's long experience with radical [MISC Basque  ] terrorism and years of monitoring and disrupting [MISC Islamic  ] radical organizations , the March 11 , 2004 [LOC Madrid  ] train attacks came as a shock to [MISC Spanish  ] security officials . 
The [ORG GOS  ] has since tripled the number of officials charged with tracking [MISC Islamic  ] extremist activity and ramped up police operations aimed at disrupting the operations of suspected terrorist cells . 
Successes in 2004/2005 include: -- " [ORG Operation NOVA  ] , " October 2004 - Police dismantled a terrorist ring that was planning to purchase explosives in order to attack [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG High Court  ] with a 500 kilogram bomb ( specifically to kill anti-terrorism magistrates ) and to bomb other [LOC Madrid  ] landmarks . 
The group consisted mainly of [MISC Moroccans  ] recruited in [MISC Spanish  ] prisons by [MISC Algerian  ] national [PER Abderrahmane Tahiri  ] ( better known as " [PER Mohamed Achraf  ] " ) . 
-- Continuing arrests related to the [LOC Madrid  ] train bombings , such as the December 2004 detention of [ORG GICM  ] figure [PER Hassan  ] el [PER Haski  ] and the June 2005 detention of five [MISC Moroccan  ] nationals linked to train bombing conspirator [PER Mohamed Afalah  ] . 
-- " [LOC Operation Tigris  ] , " June 2005 - The [ORG National Police  ] dismantled a jihadist facilitator network organized to funnel suicide bombers from [LOC Spain  ] to [LOC Iraq  ] to undertake actions against [ORG Coalition and Iraqi Government  ] targets . 
Eight of the 39 suspects detained during the operation were remanded to prison on terrorism charges , while seven others were processed for deportation to their countries of origin . 
-- Trial of 24 members of the [MISC Barakat Yarkas  ] al-Qa'ida cell , Spring 2005 . 
A verdict is expected September 20 . 
[MISC Spanish  ] media closely followed the three-month trial and [ORG GOS  ] officials have cited the importance of the prosecution of so many suspected terrorists . 
Trial observers note that while prosecutors provided ample evidence that several of the cell members had participated in terrorist training activity , they did not clearly establish a link between the [MISC Barakat Yarkas  ] cell and the 9/11 attacks , as alleged in the indictment. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOS  ] has worked closely with the [ORG USG  ] in improving its ability to identify , arrest , and prosecute suspected [MISC Islamic  ] extremists . 
Counterterrorism cooperation is one of the cornerstones of the bilateral relationship . 
Attorney General [PER Gonzales  ] and Justice Minister [PER Aguilar  ] announced the formation of a [ORG Counter Terrorism Experts Working Group  ] in March 2005 comprised of [ORG USG  ] and [ORG GOS  ] security officials and prosecutors . 
The group met in [LOC Madrid  ] in May and will meet in [LOC Washington  ] in late October . 
[LOC Spain  ] 's highly-competent financial intelligence unit , [ORG SEPLAC  ] , works very well with the [ORG USG  ] at the bilateral and multilateral level. //LINGERING PROBLEMS HINDER CT EFFORTS// <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) There are several continuing problems that undermine [LOC Spain  ] 's counterterrorism capabilities . 
The most troublesome impediment is strong inter-service rivalry , which blocks the free flow of information among the [ORG Civil Guard  ] , the [ORG National Police  ] ( [ORG SNP  ] ) , and the [ORG National Center for Intelligence  ] ( [ORG CNI  ] ) , each of which plays a counterterrorism role . 
By all accounts , a national counterterrorism center created in 2004 to improve coordination among the services has thus far failed to achieve its purpose . 
As a result , there does not appear to be a consolidated terrorist lookout list shared among the services . 
A related problem is the lack of an electronic namecheck system for customs/immigration officials to help them identify out persons of interest . 
Separately , recent press reports indicate internal frustration with the head of the [ORG SNP  ] 's intelligence branch , [PER Telesforo Rubio  ] , whose leadership style has allegedly led key figures in the [ORG SNP  ] counterterrorism unit to retire or transfer to other units. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) There are also structural differences between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] legal systems that sometimes interfere with information sharing , though both sides continue working to minimize disruption to police investigations . 
In particular , the central role of investigating magistrates , such as [PER Baltasar Garzon  ] and [PER Juan del Olmo  ] , in the [MISC Spanish  ] system and the lack of protections for intelligence information have complicated the [ORG USG  ] 's ability to share relevant information with [MISC Spanish  ] authorities . 
For their part , [MISC Spanish  ] magistrates have sometimes been loathe to share information controlled under strict judicial secrecy rules. //SPAIN FACING LONG STRUGGLE AGAINST [MISC ISLAMIC MILITANTS//  ] <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) The combination of an established and growing pool of extremist sympathizers and [LOC Spain  ] 's continued identification with " the [LOC West  ] " on the part of those extremists makes it very likely that [LOC Spain  ] will be the target of future terrorist attacks . 
The head of the [ORG MFA  ] 's [ORG Bureau of Analysis  ] , [PER Fidel Sendagorta  ] , expressed concern in a recent article that such attacks would increase public rejection of [MISC North African  ] immigrants and stir nativist sentiment , which could in turn alienate young [MISC Moroccan  ] immigrants and make them easy targets for terrorist recruiters . 
[PER Sendagorta  ] pointed to the problems faced by the [LOC UK  ] , [LOC France  ] , and the [LOC Netherlands  ] with [MISC Islamic  ] radicalism in their large [MISC Muslim  ] immigrant communities as forerunners of the problems [LOC Spain  ] will face over the next ten to twenty years . 
Unfortunately , it appears that [LOC Spain  ] will remain an active front in the War on Terror for some time to come .
