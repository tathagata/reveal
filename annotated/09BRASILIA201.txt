( C ) SUMMARY . 
On February 4 , [PER Othon Pinheiro  ] , Director-President of [ORG Eletrobras Termonuclear S.A.  ] , briefed the Ambassador on a new concept for indirect monitoring rather than intrusive inspections as a way to provide the [ORG IAEA  ] with assurances about the nature of [LOC Brazil  ] 's nuclear activities . 
This would be in lieu of an Additional Protocol . 
He had raised this with the [ORG Ministry of External Relations  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) last year , and the Ambassador raised it with Defense Minister [PER Nelson Jobim  ] on February 5 . 
Both were non-committal , though neither rejected the idea outright . 
COMMENT . 
If [LOC Washington  ] agrees , then the upcoming visit to [LOC Brazil  ] of [ORG IAEA  ] Director General [PER El Baradei  ] could be an opportunity to try to explore this possible path forward . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) At a meeting with the Ambassador on February 4 , [PER Othon Luiz Pinheiro  ] da [PER Silva  ] , Director-President of [ORG Eletrobras Termonuclear S.A  ] . 
( who completed a 30-plus year career in the [MISC Brazilian  ] Navy as an admiral ) , outlined his thoughts on how to provide the international community assurances about [LOC Brazil  ] 's nuclear activities without agreeing to an [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency  ] ( [ORG IAEA  ] ) Additional Protocol . 
The Ambassador had requested this meeting when at the end of a meeting on February 2 to discuss [LOC U.S.  ] industry interest in [LOC Brazil  ] 's civilian nuclear expansion plans [PER Pinheiro  ] had brought up his new concept . 
[PER Pinheiro  ] is sometimes called the new " nuclear energy czar " in [LOC Brazil  ] , though he downplayed his role , describing himself as just one of various actors in the circle of decisionmakers . 
He emphasized the importance in this field of the Civilian Cabinet Minister [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] , Defense Minister [PER Nelson Jobim  ] , Minister of [ORG Mines and Energy Edson Lobao  ] , and Minister of Science and Technology [PER Sergio Resende  ] , as well as Ambassador [PER Andre Amado  ] , the [ORG Ministry of External Relations'  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) Under Secretary equivalent for Energy and Technology . 
Further , the [ORG National Commission  ] on [ORG Nuclear Energy  ] ( [ORG CNEN  ] ) , [ORG Industrias Nucleares Brasileiras  ] ( [ORG INB  ] ) and [ORG Eletrobras  ] were critical entities with regards to building and operating nuclear power plants . 
BACKGROUND ON HOW WE GOT WHERE WE ARE <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Pinheiro  ] provided his take on how [LOC Brazil  ] reached the current position with regard to an [ORG IAEA  ] Additional Protocol . 
Prior to 1997 , the Government of [LOC Brazil  ] ( [ORG GOB  ] ) had refused to sign on to the [LOC Non-Proliferation Treaty  ] ( [ORG NPT  ] ) because they viewed it as asymmetrical and unfair in its treatment of nuclear weapons states and the others . 
He characterized the view then as the [ORG NPT  ] was a tool for the nuclear weapons states to suppress the other countries . 
Then President [PER Fernando Henrique Cardoso  ] came to power and he signed the [ORG NPT  ] and obtained [ORG Congressional  ] approval . 
Earlier , both [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Argentina  ] ended their clandestine weapons programs , restored democratic rule , and created in 1991 the [ORG Argentine-Brazilian Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials  ] ( [ORG ABACC  ] ) . 
In 1997 , [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Argentina  ] , [ORG ABACC  ] and the [ORG IAEA  ] concluded the [ORG Quadpartite Agreement  ] that still governs their relationship . 
[ORG ABACCC  ] allowed regular inspections of [MISC Brazilian  ] and [MISC Argentine  ] declared sites to provide both countries assurances on their nuclear activities. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Now [LOC Brazil  ] faces calls that it agree to an [ORG IAEA  ] Additional Protocol with its more intrusive inspection regime . 
[PER Pinheiro  ] claimed that the [MISC Brazilian  ] constitution prohibits allowing such inspections , which could be made anywhere and not just at declared sites . 
He did not provide details with respect to this contention that an Additional Protocol would violate the constitution . 
( NOTE . 
[ORG MRE  ] 's Director of the [ORG Division on Disarmament and Sensitive Technologies  ] [PER Santiago Mourao  ] told [ORG UNVIE Amb  ] . 
[PER Greg Schulte  ] in October 2008 that he did not see a technical problem with [LOC Brazil  ] signing an intrusive Additional Protocol ; however , there were difficulties of a political nature . 
Similarly , key figures in the nuclear energy sector in [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] saw no technical reason precluding [LOC Brazil  ] signing such an agreement ( [ORG REFTEL  ] A ) . 
END NOTE . 
) [PER Pinheiro  ] was quick to add that he did not see any interest in [LOC Brazil  ] to move towards nuclear proliferation . 
A POSSIBLE WAY FORWARD ? <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Pinheiro  ] had been thinking about the matter of providing assurances to the international community without having intrusive inspections . 
He commented that besides violating the [MISC Brazilian  ] constitution , the intrusive inspections called for by an Additional Protocol actually could lead to nuclear proliferation as the many inspectors involved from different countries would be able to see and learn highly-sensitive and dangerous technologies . 
He said that the way forward would be to have monitoring indirectly through sensors . 
These sensors would detect the presence of nuclear material , he confidently explained . 
Fissile material is hard to hide undetected , he said . 
The particles given off by nuclear material are very difficult to block and so off-site monitoring can be an effective tool , he explained . 
Thus , the monitoring would not be intrusive , no inspectors would be physically entering undeclared sites , though they would still " visit " declared sites . 
[PER Pinheiro  ] said he had consulted with a colleague of his at [ORG ABACC  ] , an inspector named Dr. [PER Carlos Feu  ] ( strictly protect ) , and they thought this system would give reasonable assurance of no unauthorized working with or diversions of nuclear materials. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Pinheiro  ] said he had raised this concept with officials in the [ORG MRE  ] last year , saying it might be an alternative way to go . 
He encouraged them to talk with Dr. [PER Feu  ] of [ORG ABACC  ] . 
The [ORG MRE  ] officials neither approved of the concept nor disapproved it . 
He added that it might be more difficult to advance the concept since the release in December of the new [ORG National Defense Strategy  ] ( [ORG REFTEL  ] B ) , which calls for the [ORG GOB  ] not to agree to any new restrictions on nuclear energy until others comply with their obligations ( read - the nuclear weapons powers make progress on disarming ) . 
NON-COMMITTAL DEFENSE MINISTER - NO FAN OF THE [ORG IAEA  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) At a meeting on February 5 with Defense Minister [PER Jobim  ] ( who is clearly a pivotal figure on nuclear issues ) , the Ambassador brought up his discussion the day before with [PER Pinheiro  ] . 
He asked [PER Jobim  ] whether this idea might be a way to proceed forward with the [ORG IAEA  ] . 
[PER Jobim  ] thought it was interesting , but was non-committal . 
Also , the Ambassador inquired about who else within the [ORG GOB  ] would move on this issue . 
[PER Jobim  ] responded that any discussion of these issues should go through him exclusively , and " not through [ORG MRE  ] . 
" <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The topic of the [ORG IAEA  ] did lead [PER Jobim  ] to launch into a criticism of that agency , saying that in a recent incident they had overreached . 
In that case , the [ORG IAEA  ] had wanted to interview a [MISC Brazilian  ] scientist because he had written about how to produce nuclear weapons , apparently as an academic think piece . 
[PER Jobim  ] was dismayed to find that the [ORG Ministry of External Relations  ] had actually been helpful to the [ORG IAEA  ] in trying to set up a meeting with the scientist . 
He declared that he became engaged and put an end to allowing any interrogation of the scientist by [ORG IAEA  ] inspectors . 
[PER PINHEIRO  ] - A PRACTICAL PERSON WITH PRACTICAL ADVICE <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) As he repeatedly underscored , [PER Pinheiro  ] is first and foremost an engineer . 
He looks for practical solutions . 
This was exemplified in how he developed a way for [ORG IAEA  ] inspectors to visit [MISC Brazilian  ] sites , while at the same time protecting confidential information . 
In that instance , he introduced the use of material to cover parts of the equipment , but allowing enough to be viewed by the inspectors to accomplish their task . 
He said that then [ORG IAEA  ] Director General [PER Hans Blix  ] had liked the idea . 
" We can make things transparent and still keep secrets , " [PER Pinheiro  ] stated. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Pinheiro  ] advised that [LOC Brazil  ] needed to be treated like [LOC Japan  ] , [LOC Germany  ] and other developed countries , and not like [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Iran  ] as countries trying to develop nuclear weapons . 
Any agreement with the [ORG IAEA  ] for additional oversight / monitoring / inspection would have to entail a different way of inspecting . 
COMMENT <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Pinheiro  ] offers an interesting concept on how to proceed forward with providing assurances to the international community about [LOC Brazil  ] 's nuclear activities while addressing their concerns about intrusiveness . 
The tepid responses - though not rejections - from [ORG MRE  ] and the [ORG Defense Ministry  ] mean that more groundwork needs to be done in [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Vienna  ] , and [LOC Washington  ] would be required if there is interest in moving the concept to the next stage . 
The upcoming visit of [ORG IAEA  ] Director General [PER El Baradei  ] could be a good opportunity to try to explore this possibility further . 
END COMMENT .
