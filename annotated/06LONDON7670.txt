( C ) The [LOC UK  ] shares [LOC U.S.  ] concerns about the [MISC French  ] draft [ORG UNSCR  ] on [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] ( reftel ) but wants to avoid being seen to lobby against [LOC France  ] in the [ORG UNSC  ] , according to [ORG FCO West Africa Section Head Jason Moore  ] . 
He told [ORG Poloff October  ] 30 that UKUN is working closely with [MISC USUN  ] , hoping to reach an acceptable text closer to the language used by the [ORG African Union 's Peace and Security Council  ] . 
Given President [PER Gbagbo  ] 's proven ability to manipulate the situation , a maximalist approach is needed , but it must remain within international law and precedent , [PER Moore  ] said , and there is no precedent for a [ORG UNSCR  ] superseding the constitution of a sovereign state where the [ORG UN  ] is not the executive . 
( We understand that the [MISC FCO Legal Adviser  ] 's office has discussed this point with L . 
) [PER Moore  ] said [PER Gbagbo  ] had written to Prime Minister [PER Blair last  ] week rejecting any formula that would set aside his country 's national sovereignty in violation of the [ORG UN Charter.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Moore  ] found the [MISC French  ] stance puzzling , because: - the hard line came from President [PER Chirac  ] personally but in no way implied a [MISC French  ] willingness to serve as enforcer ; - in HMG 's view , it is obvious that the [ORG UNSC  ] would damage its credibility if it made grand pronouncements that it cannot or will not enforce. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Moore  ] was also surprised that [LOC France  ] had managed to line up the support of [ORG African Security Council  ] members [LOC Ghana  ] and [LOC Republic  ] of [LOC Congo  ] , and unsure how it had succeeded in doing so . 
( [LOC Tanzania  ] 's view is more in line with the [LOC UK  ] 's , according to [PER Moore  ] .
