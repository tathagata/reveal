( [LOC S  ] ) Over the last six weeks , President [PER Ortega  ] has made an uncharacteristically intense effort to pass messages of conciliation and cooperation in our direction . 
[PER Ortega  ] 's actions include renewed cooperation on some dormant legal assistance requests , especially cordial treatment of visiting [MISC VIPs  ] , a possible decision on a new [MISC Ambassador-designate  ] , and a personal and quick response to the Ambassador 's request for information from [PER Ortega  ] regarding the Secretary 's planned trip to the region . 
Yet , over the past three years , such " good " behavior by [PER Ortega  ] has occurred only when he sought a particular political objective - e.g. the early-2009 " charm offensive " that unsuccessfully sought to prevent the partial termination of [LOC Nicaragua  ] 's [ORG MCC  ] compact . 
The motivation behind the current " charm offensive " is still unclear , but is unlikely to portend a new , friendly [PER Ortega  ] with whom we can work in the long-term . 
End Summary . 
GON Has Been [MISC Cooperative Lately  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) Over the last few weeks , we have noted a concerted effort by President [PER Daniel Ortega  ] and [ORG First Lady  ] [PER Rosario Murillo  ] to send conciliatory signals our way . 
In late-January we were contacted by the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] seeking to re-engage us on a renewal of the Status of Forces Agreement governing [LOC U.S.  ] troop presence in [LOC Nicaragua  ] ( [ORG REF  ] A ) . 
At about the same time , the [ORG Foreign Minister  ] and the Attorney General both indicated to the Ambassador that the government desired to be helpful on some long-stagnant evidence transfers requests we had made in 2009 ( [ORG REF  ] F ) . 
We also learned that [PER Ortega  ] recently approached [PER Arturo Cruz  ] , Jr , the former Ambassador to the [LOC U.S.  ] , about returning for a second tour as [ORG Managua  ] 's representative in [LOC Washington  ] , a post that has been vacant since [PER Cruz  ] himself left it in March 2009 ( details SEPTEL ) . 
[PER Ortega  ] , through [PER Cruz  ] , has also invited WHA DAS [PER Julissa Reynoso  ] to visit [ORG Managua  ] . 
Additionally , both [PER Ortega  ] and [PER Murillo  ] were exceptionally , and uncharacteristically , friendly to the [LOC U.S.  ] Delegation , led by DASD Dr. [PER Frank Mora  ] , that attended the February 22 change of command ceremony for [LOC Nicaragua  ] 's [ORG Military High Command  ] . 
Both [PER Ortega  ] and [PER Murillo  ] spent several minutes with the [LOC USDEL  ] prior to the ceremony and were effusive in their praise of [LOC U.S.  ] mil-to-mil assistance . 
This string of events taken together , over the past six weeks , represents an unusually friendly level of communication and interaction by the [PER Ortega  ] government. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) On Friday , February 19 , per instructions from [LOC Washington  ] , the Ambassador contacted the President 's office to inquire whether [PER Ortega  ] would participate in a proposed meeting between the Secretary and Central [MISC American  ] heads of state that would take place in [LOC Guatemala  ] during the first week of March . 
Normally our requests [ORG MANAGUA  ] 00000115 002 OF 004 of this nature go unanswered . 
However , within a few hours of making this initial contact , [ORG First Lady  ] [PER Murillo  ] personally called the Ambassador seeking more information about the meeting . 
She also asked the Ambassador to visit the [PER Ortega  ] residence , which also serves as the Presidential " offices . 
" NOTE: In 2007 , [PER Ortega  ] refused to occupy [LOC Nicaragua  ] 's Presidential palace . 
Instead he governs the country - and runs his [MISC Sandinista  ] party -- from his home . 
END NOTE . 
[PER Murillo  ] asked the Ambassador to meet that same evening following a Cabinet meeting ; however , she later called to re-schedule for the afternoon of Saturday , February 20 , explaining the cabinet meeting had run longer than expected . 
Is this really " [MISC True Love  ] ? 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) During the Saturday afternoon meeting , the Ambassador found the [ORG First Couple  ] cordial , even friendly , contrary to past experience . 
[PER Ortega  ] apologized for the attack on the [MISC Embassy  ] in November ( [ORG REF  ] C ) , noting that he had personally intervened with the Chief of Police to ensure the [MISC Embassy  ] [ eventually ] had protection from anti-riot units ( and for the Ambassador himself on the following day ) . 
When the Ambassador noted our concern over the fact that senior [ORG FSLN  ] leaders had been seen urging on the violent protestors , [PER Ortega  ] somewhat sheepishly acknowledged that at times , even he , cannot control his own people . 
Ambassador to [PER Ortega:  ] Your Behavior Damages Our Relations <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The Ambassador raised the nearly year-long vacancy at [LOC Nicaragua  ] 's [MISC Embassy  ] in [LOC Washington  ] , noting that some in [LOC Washington  ] perceive this as an intentional slight by [ORG Managua  ] . 
[PER Ortega  ] responded slyly that he was on the verge of naming - likely in March - a new man ( or , he noted , even a woman ) to fill the post . 
( " Tal vez , una embajadora.. . 
" ) The Ambassador also protested [PER Ortega  ] 's false claims about the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" military occupation " of [LOC Haiti  ] following the January 12 earthquake ( [ORG REF  ] B ) . 
He told [PER Ortega  ] the Secretary had been very angry at [PER Ortega  ] for the malicious comments . 
[PER Ortega  ] responded weakly that he had spoken in ignorance , and that he later became aware that other nations had also sent troops. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Turning to the Secretary 's proposed [LOC Guatemala  ] meeting with regional heads-of-state , [PER Ortega  ] expressed concern that [LOC U.S.  ] intent was to force the issue of [LOC Honduras  ] recognition . 
He restated [LOC Nicaragua  ] 's opposition to recognizing the [MISC Lobo  ] government , adding that he would do nothing until the various censures on [LOC Honduras  ] by multilateral bodies - the [ORG UN  ] , [ORG OAS  ] , [ORG SICA  ] , [ORG Rio Group  ] , and ALBA. - had been lifted . 
[PER Ortega  ] said he needed more information before agreeing , but ended the one-and-one-half-hour meeting on a friendly note . 
The [ORG First Couple  ] 's good will carried into Sunday , when they met with the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation attending the change of command ceremony for [LOC Nicaragua  ] 's military high command . 
[PER Ortega  ] and [PER Murillo  ] were careful to spend several minutes chatting with each member of the [ORG USDel  ] before the ceremony . 
Even [PER Ortega  ] 's remarks , which included the typical anti-imperialist screed , were milder than normal . 
[ORG MANAGUA  ] 00000115 003 OF 004 What 's " Wrong " With [PER Ortega  ] ? <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) While [PER Ortega  ] 's true motives are only ever fully known to himself , over the past three years we have occasionally seen his " conciliatory " face , but only as a means to a short-term objective . 
We recall the unsuccessful charm offensive against us in early-2009 that sought to prevent the partial termination of [ORG MCC  ] ( [ORG REF  ] G ) . 
It was followed by vicious and malicious public attacks over several months , culminating with [PER Ortega  ] 's speech at the Army birthday celebration , when he accused [LOC U.S.  ] forces of genocide ( [ORG REF  ] E ) The pattern is a spurt of amity and cooperation that is immediately followed by distance , contempt , and even hostility regardless of whether his objective is achieved . 
At times it seems [PER Ortega  ] 's subsequent " rejection " of his " intended " is more severe when he succeeds . 
Others - the [MISC Europeans  ] , [LOC Taiwan  ] , [LOC Japan  ] , the [ORG World Bank  ] and the [ORG IMF  ] - have received similar treatment , often ahead of decisions on funding for foreign assistance or important visits . 
Nearly all have subsequently been spurned . 
Is It Frustrated Foreign Policy ? <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) One of [PER Ortega  ] 's current motives in seeking a " thaw " with us may be a reflection of his unsuccessful attempts to wean [LOC Nicaragua  ] off the " imperialist " aid of the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Europe  ] . 
He is keenly aware ( and resentful ) of [LOC Nicaragua  ] 's dependence upon outside assistance , especially ours . 
Given his constant anti-U.S. rhetoric , the scale and persistence of [LOC U.S.  ] aid contrasts greatly with that of other patrons [PER Ortega  ] has actively wooed . 
Three years of persistent overtures to [LOC Iran  ] have failed to produce anything besides ideological capital and a handful of commercial delegations . 
His long-standing ally , [LOC Cuba  ] , continues to provide medical and educational " brigades " for rural [LOC Nicaragua  ] , but these rely on [MISC Venezuelan  ] funding and the support of their [MISC Nicaraguan  ] hosts for sustenance . 
[LOC Russia  ] has been [PER Ortega  ] 's other promising target . 
His recognition of [LOC Georgia  ] 's two breakaway republics was clearly designed to please [LOC Moscow  ] ( [ORG REF  ] D ) , and though [LOC Moscow  ] has recently come through with some limited assistance , including a fleet of modern buses and the promise of military aid and cooperation , the commitment still falls far short of [MISC Cold War  ] levels , for which [PER Ortega  ] had hoped . 
[MISC Russian  ] Foreign Minister [PER Lavrov  ] was on the ground for less than 24 hours here during his mid-February trip . 
Is It Unrequited [ORG ALBA  ] ? <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [ORG ALBA  ] bloc is an increasingly vocal and coordinated grouping that demands attention in international fora , both inside and outside the [ORG Hemisphere  ] . 
Yet there are indications that the [LOC Ortega-Chavez  ] revolutionary partnership may be suffering a cold snap . 
Over three years , [PER Chavez  ] has supplied [PER Ortega  ] with nearly a billion dollars in badly-needed " assistance , " but [PER Ortega  ] 's constant need for operating cash to off-set forfeited donor assistance is likely now wearisome for [PER Chavez  ] who faces growing domestic economic [ORG MANAGUA  ] 00000115 004 OF 004 difficulties . 
The [MISC Venezuelan  ] in charge of the joint-venture [ORG ALBA  ] de [LOC Nicaragua  ] ( [ORG ALBANISA  ] ) , an umbrella holding company that channels [MISC Venezuelan  ] funds , was recently " recalled " to [LOC Caracas  ] after a series of unfortunate public statements about [LOC Venezuela  ] 's plan and goals in [LOC Nicaragua  ] . 
The " dynamic duo " appears to have been strained by several factors , including disagreements over how aggressively to exploit [LOC Zelaya  ] and the [LOC Honduras  ] coup and rivalry over who is the [ORG Hemisphere  ] 's rightful heir to [PER Castro  ] 's " revolutionary " legacy . 
Both [PER Chavez  ] and [PER Raul Castro  ] came here for the hastily-convened June 2009 [ORG ALBA/SICA/Rio Group  ] meeting that followed the [LOC Honduras  ] coup . 
Yet both confirmed for , but failed to attend , [PER Ortega  ] 's July 19 gala commemorating the 30th anniversary of the [MISC Sandinista  ] victory . 
[PER Ortega  ] was also surely stung by the last-minute cancellations of both [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] for the recent military change of command . 
Even so , we do not/not believe that [ORG ALBA  ] is in imminent danger of collapse . 
In fact , we are confident that [PER Ortega  ] would not recognize [LOC Honduras  ] without prior consultation with , even authorization by , [PER Chavez  ] . 
Comment <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) At this point , we can only speculate as to [PER Ortega  ] 's underlying aim or motive behind this current amiable countenance . 
We note that in [LOC Nicaragua  ] 's most famous theatrical work , " [MISC El Gueguense  ] " ( The [LOC Old Man  ] ) , performers hold masks over their faces . 
The theme is deception , and the ubiquitous masks , with their false , painted-on smiles , symbolize the mutual distrust between the colonial-era indigenous population and their duplicitous [MISC Spanish  ] overlords . 
The smiling masks project an outward appearance of comity and respect , while true visages and feelings are hidden from view . 
In our experience , [PER Ortega  ] 's charm offensives are gueguense - short-lived and insincere . 
Perhaps in the face of less-than-successful foreign policy to diversify his donor base , and disenchanted with the lack of revolutionary camaraderie within the [MISC Bolivarian  ] experiment , he simply seeks reassurance that we plan to stay on here . 
We will . 
And hope this new beginning does not end in disappointment , again .
