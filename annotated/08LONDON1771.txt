End summary . 
Criteria for [MISC Liberal  ] Interventionism ------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Clegg  ] , s primary message was the [LOC UK  ] , s need to adopt a doctrine of what he called “liberal interventionism , ” similar to the UN’s concept of “Responsibility to [MISC Protect.” This  ] doctrine , explained [PER Clegg  ] , calls for the [LOC UK  ] to become involved in foreign conflicts only if a ) the cause is just and as a last resort , b ) intervention is well intentioned , c ) military action is proportional and sanctioned by legitimate authority , and d ) there exists a reasonable chance of success . 
[PER Clegg  ] argued that the [LOC UK  ] must adapt its military and strategic resources to the post-Cold War world , and mentioned the need to focus more on supporting troops in the field as opposed to spending money on “outdated” weapons systems such as the [LOC Typhoon  ] fighter jet and Trident missile system . 
[LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] -------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Clegg  ] briefly touched on [LOC Iraq  ] , and reaffirmed the [MISC Liberal Democrats  ] , position that troop levels must be drawn down . 
He said that the “unjustified” invasion of [LOC Iraq  ] has severely damaged the [LOC UK  ] , s moral authority , and will make it difficult to institute his “liberal interventionist8 policy proposals. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Clegg  ] argued for more aid and assistance to be sent to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , underscoring his belief that failure there would lead to greater instability in the region and a proliferation of narcotics production . 
Moreover , he called for the [PER Brown  ] government to be more forthright with the [MISC British  ] people about the costs and length of involvement that will be required to secure a stable [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[LOC Zimbabwe  ] -------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Clegg  ] also touched on [LOC Zimbabwe  ] , and explained that , despite the pressing humanitarian concerns , [MISC Western  ] military involvement would be counterproductive , in part because there is no regional support for intervention . 
Instead , he supported [ORG UN  ] involvement , and called on [MISC South African  ] President [PER Thabo Mbeki  ] to curtail electricity supplies to the country . 
[LOC Europe  ] ------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Clegg  ] argued that the [LOC UK  ] must take a stronger role in [LOC Europe  ] . 
He sees in [MISC French  ] President [PER Nicolas Sarkozy  ] an unlikely ally in the development of stronger [MISC French-UK  ] military coordination , and explained that while the development of an [ORG EU  ] military capability cannot be allowed to undermine [ORG NATO  ] , the [ORG EU  ] should still possess a military force strong enough to act unilaterally if necessary . 
He also said that , despite the now gloomy prospects for ratifying the [ORG Lisbon Treaty  ] , the [ORG EU  ] can still move forward . 
It is time , he explained , to stop “tinkering with the machine and put it to use , ” and called for [LOC Britain  ] to be more involved in major [ORG EU  ] decision-making , instead of merely criticizing such decisions from the sidelines . 
[LOC LONDON  ] 00001771 002 OF 002 Comment ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) Since becoming leader of the [MISC Liberal Democrats  ] , [MISC Clegg’s  ] general foreign policy tone has softened . 
His earlier hard-line rhetoric against the war in [LOC Iraq  ] and on extradition/rendition issues has given way to a slightly more thoughtful and measured approach . 
These issues have lost some of their domestic vote-getting potency and therefore [PER Clegg  ] and others have turned to new topics . 
In taking the reins of the [ORG Liberal Democrat  ] party , [PER Clegg  ] is restrained by the responsibilities that his leadership role imposes on his rhetoric , though he has not yet succeeded in imposing complete discipline on the members of his own party when it comes to their public comments on foreign policy subjects. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Clegg  ] himself spoke confidently and passionately in his address about the UK’s need to become involved in a more unified [ORG EU  ] . 
He appeared quite knowledgeable in response to questions about the [ORG International Criminal Court  ] and [LOC UK  ] military spending , though slightly less sure of himself when asked about [LOC Darfur  ] and [LOC Burma  ] . 
Having only assumed the leadership of the [LOC Lib Dems  ] last year , he appears to still be broadening his understanding of , and comfort level with , international issues . 
Bio Note -------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 .

While he used to focus on [LOC Iraq  ] and rendition in [LOC Parliament  ] , earning quick applause from his [MISC Lib Dem  ] colleagues , he now focuses on domestic issues that matter more to the voting public. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 .
