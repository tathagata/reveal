( [ORG U  ] ) Summary: In the final days before [LOC Iceland  ] 's May 12 parliamentary elections , highly volatile poll data has shown drastic changes in party support . 
The [ORG Progressive Party  ] is polling higher than it has for months , while the Left [MISC Greens  ] are losing the momentum they had been gaining over the past year . 
The margins are slim enough that the prospects for the current government 's hold on power vary from poll to poll . 
Prominent analysts have declared that voters will essentially be putting the current government 's economic policies on trial . 
A plurality of voters would prefer to see the same government on May 13 , but popular distaste for the [MISC Progressives  ] stands a good chance of forcing PM [PER Haarde  ] 's [ORG Independence Party  ] into coalition with the [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG Gallup  ] started releasing daily polling data on May 7 ahead of the May 12 elections to the [ORG Althingi  ] ( parliament ) . 
The most recent results ( May 10 ) were as follows: Percentage of voters expressing a preference ( [ORG Gallup  ] ) : [ORG Independence  ] ( [ORG IP  ] ) : 36 [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) : 26 Left-Green ( [ORG LG  ] ) : 16 Progressive ( [ORG PP  ] ) : 14 Liberal ( [ORG LP  ] ) : 7 [ORG Iceland Movement  ] ( [ORG IM  ] ) : 2 Undecided/no preference stated: 11 percent of respondents. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Compared to [ORG Gallup  ] and [ORG Frettabladid  ] polling data two weeks ago ( Ref . 
A ) , the [ORG IP  ] 's support is dwindling somewhat , in keeping with its history of scoring higher in the polls than on [MISC Election Day  ] . 
The [ORG PP  ] is now rising faster than it has for months , polling at 14 percent , having gained about four percent in two weeks . 
Historically , the [ORG PP  ] , in contrast to the [ORG IP  ] , always fares better in elections than in opinion polls . 
Support for the [MISC Left-Greens  ] , which peaked several weeks ago , is now measuring 16 percent . 
This is consistent with past pre-election indicators , where the [ORG LG  ] tends to steadily lose voter support shortly before elections . 
The [ORG SDA  ] is now winning back the support that it earlier lost to the Left [MISC Greens  ] , as more and more voters may be realizing that the Left [MISC Greens  ] would be an uneasy partner in a coalition government . 
In contrast , voters may be catching on to the idea that the [ORG SDA  ] 's center-left policy could be more amenable to the [ORG IP  ] , were these two parties to form a government. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Both [ORG Independence  ] and the [MISC Progressives  ] are hoping that voters' general happiness with their standard of living will translate into support on election day . 
A May 7 [ORG Frettabladid  ] poll showed that more than one third of the electorate would like the current coalition government to stay in power , which is an increase of eight percent since late April . 
Other possible coalitions fared considerably worse: twenty percent of voters prefer a left-of-center government that would consist of the [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] and the Left [ORG Green Movement  ] , while about 15 percent favor an [MISC IP-SDA  ] government and approximately nine percent fancy an [MISC IP-LG  ] coalition. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comfort with the current coalition aside , two days away from the elections , results differed from one poll to the next about whether the current [MISC IP-PP  ] government will lose or maintain its majority . 
The most recent [ORG Gallup  ] poll shows the current [MISC IP-PP  ] coalition with a slim one-seat majority , but polls by [ORG Frettabladid  ] and Bladid on May 10 and 11 both show the government losing its majority . 
Prominent [ORG PP  ] members , such as Foreign Minister [PER Valgerdur Sverrisdottir  ] and Minister of Agriculture [PER Gudni Agustsson  ] , have said that the party needs greater support in order to be able to stake a claim to extend its partnership in the current coalition . 
[PER Agustsson  ] stated that the party needs to get 17-20 percent for this to happen . 
( Comment: This would be an amazing last-minute turnaround , even for the [MISC Progressives  ] . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) As a result , a number of political observers and pundits now predict an [MISC IP-SDA  ] coalition . 
They think that in order for [MISC Icelandic  ] politics not to become stagnant a new coalition must take over the reins . 
The [ORG PP  ] 's following has , moreover , dwindled to such an extent that it would not have a legitimate place in government . 
The observers also note that there are not as many ideological differences between the [ORG IP  ] and the [ORG SDA  ] as there would be in an [MISC Independence/Left-Greens  ] coalition . 
An [MISC IP-SDA  ] coalition would be a robust one in parliament and reminiscent of the so-called [ORG Resurrection Government  ] ( Vidreisnarstjorn ) --that consisted of the [ORG IP  ] and the [ORG Social Democratic Party  ] , one of the forerunners to the [MISC SDA--and  ] was in power from 1959-1971 . 
The [ORG Resurrection Government  ] has , in fact , been called one of the two " islands of stability " in [MISC Icelandic  ] politics , the other one being the current [MISC IP-PP  ] coalition that has been in power since 1995 . 
[ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000139 002 OF 002 <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: Voters are not awed by the ongoing election campaign , which many characterize as lackluster . 
Environmental protection has virtually disappeared from the campaign over the last week continuing the trend since the March 31 Hafnarfjordur referendum ( Ref . 
A ) . 
A lack of disagreement on election issues in general has enabled the [ORG IP  ] and [ORG PP  ] to champion the vibrant economy and the high standard of living , which has been achieved under the current coalition , without much resistance from the opposition . 
The biggest problem for the [ORG Independence Party  ] is that voters are tired of the [MISC Progressives  ] , who despite their late run but may not draw enough support to keep the government in power . 
Absent a Progressive miracle , Prime Minister [PER Haarde  ] ( [ORG Independence  ] ) will be searching for a new coalition partner come May 13 . 
He may find that the [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] offers a smaller ideological gap to bridge than his other potential partners .
