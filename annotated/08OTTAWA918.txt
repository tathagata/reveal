( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary . 
[ORG Canadian Security Intelligence Service  ] ( [ORG CSIS  ] ) Director [PER Judd  ] discussed domestic and foreign terror threats with Counselor of the [ORG State Department Cohen  ] in [LOC Ottawa  ] on July 2 . 
[PER Judd  ] admitted that [ORG CSIS  ] was increasingly distracted from its mission by legal challenges that could endanger foreign intelligence-sharing with [MISC Canadian  ] agencies . 
He predicted that the upcoming release of a [ORG DVD of Guantanamo  ] detainee and [MISC Canadian  ] citizen [PER Omar Khadr’s  ] interrogation by [MISC Canadian  ] officials would lead to heightened pressure on the government to press for his return to [LOC Canada  ] , which the government would continue to resist . 
[PER Judd  ] shared Dr. Cohen’s negative assessment of current political , economic , and security trends in [LOC Pakistan  ] , and was worried about what it would mean for the [ORG ISAF  ] mission in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[LOC Canada  ] has begun formulating an inter-agency [LOC Pakistan  ] strategy , and [ORG CSIS  ] had agreed to open a channel to [MISC Iran’s  ] intelligence service which [PER Judd  ] has not yet “figured out.” ( Septel will cover Dr. Cohen’s discussions regarding [LOC Pakistan  ] and the [ORG OEF  ] and [ORG ISAF  ] missions in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
) End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Counselor of the [ORG Department of State Eliot Cohen  ] and [ORG CSIS  ] Director [PER Jim Judd  ] in [LOC Ottawa  ] on July 2 discussed threats posed by violent [MISC Islamist  ] groups in [LOC Canada  ] , and recent developments in [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
( [ORG CSIS  ] is [ORG Canada’s  ] lead agency for national security intelligence . 
) Director [PER Judd  ] ascribed an “Alice in Wonderland” worldview to [MISC Canadians  ] and their courts , whose judges have tied [ORG CSIS  ] “in knots , ” making it ever more difficult to detect and prevent terror attacks in [LOC Canada  ] and abroad . 
The situation , he commented , left government security agencies on the defensive and losing public support for their effort to protect [LOC Canada  ] and its allies . 
Legal Wrangling [ORG Risks Chill Effect  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Judd  ] derided recent judgments in [ORG Canada’s  ] courts that threaten to undermine foreign government intelligence- Qthat threaten to undermine foreign government intelligence- and information-sharing with [LOC Canada  ] . 
These judgments posit that [MISC Canadian  ] authorities cannot use information that “may have been” derived from torture , and that any [MISC Canadian  ] public official who conveys such information may be subject to criminal prosecution . 
This , he commented , put the government in a reverse-onus situation whereby it would have to “prove” the innocence of partner nations in the face of assumed wrongdoing. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Judd  ] credited Prime Minister [PER Stephen Harper’s  ] minority Conservative government for “taking it on the chin and pressing ahead” with common sense measures despite court challenges and political knocks from the opposition and interest groups . 
When asked to look to the future , [PER Judd  ] predicted that [LOC Canada  ] would soon implement [MISC UK-like  ] legal procedures that make intelligence available to “vetted defense lawyers who see everything the judge sees.” [LOC OTTAWA  ] 00000918 002.2 OF 003 Terror Cases and [ORG Communities Present Mixed Pictures  ] --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Judd  ] commented that cherry-picked sections of the court-ordered release of a [ORG DVD of Guantanamo  ] detainee and [MISC Canadian  ] citizen [PER Omar Khadr  ] ( ref D ) would likely show three ( [MISC Canadian  ] ) adults interrogating a kid who breaks down in tears . 
He observed that the images would no doubt trigger “knee-jerk anti-Americanism” and “paroxysms of moral outrage , a [MISC Canadian  ] specialty , ” as well as lead to a new round of heightened pressure on the government to press for [PER Khadr’s  ] return to [LOC Canada  ] . 
He predicted that PM Harper’s government would nonetheless continue to resist this pressure. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The Director mentioned other major cases that also presented [ORG CSIS  ] with major legal headaches due to the use of intelligence products in their development: [PER Momin Khawaja  ] has been on trial for his role in an [ORG Al Qaeda  ] [LOC UK  ] bomb plot since June 23 in the first major test of [ORG Canada’s  ] 2001 [ORG Anti-Terrorism Act  ] , and [ORG Canada’s  ] ability to protect intelligence supplied by foreign government sources ( ref D ) ; the trial of the first of the home-grown [LOC Toronto  ] 11 ( down from 18 ) terror plotters , which is also now underway ; and , the prosecution of [LOC XXXXXXXXXXXX.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Judd  ] said he viewed [PER Khawaja  ] and his “ilk” as outliers , due in part to the fact that [ORG Canada’s  ] ethnic [MISC Pakistani  ] community is unlike its ghettoized and poorly educated [LOC UK  ] counterpart . 
It is largely made up of traders , lawyers , doctors , engineers , and others who see promise for themselves and their children in [LOC North America  ] , he observed , so its members are unlikely to engage in domestic terror plots . 
He said that therefore [ORG CSIS  ] main domestic focus is instead on fundraising and procurement , as well as the recruitment of a small number of [MISC Canadian  ] “wannabes” of [MISC Pakistani  ] origin for mostly overseas operations . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] ------------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Turning to [LOC Pakistan  ] , Counselor [PER Cohen  ] briefed his recent trip to [LOC Islamabad  ] and [LOC Peshawar  ] , noting his alarm at the degrading economic , political , and security situation there , and its implications for [LOC Pakistan  ] , [MISC Afghan  ] , and regional stability . 
[PER Judd  ] responded that Dr. Cohen’s sober assessment tracked with CSIS’ own view of [LOC Pakistan  ] , and that “it is hard to see a good outcome there” due to that country’s political , economic , and security failures , on top of fast-rising oil and food prices . 
[LOC Canada  ] does not have an explicit strategy for [LOC Pakistan  ] , [PER Judd  ] said , but [ORG Privy Council Deputy Secretary  ] [PER David Mulroney  ] ( who leads the interagency on [LOC Afghanistan  ] ) now has the lead on developing one ( septel ) . 
Dr. [PER Cohen  ] remarked , and [PER Judd  ] agreed , that it would be necessary to avoid approaching [LOC Pakistan  ] as simply an adjunct to the [ORG ISAF  ] and [ORG OEF  ] missions in [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG CSIS  ] is far from being “high-five mode” on Q10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG CSIS  ] is far from being “high-five mode” on [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Judd  ] asserted , due in part to [ORG Karzai’s  ] weak leadership , widespread corruption , the lack of will to press ahead on counter-narcotics , limited [MISC Afghan  ] security force capability ( particularly the police ) and , most recently , the [LOC Sarpoza  ] prison break . 
He commented that [ORG CSIS  ] had seen [LOC Sarpoza  ] coming , and its link to the [LOC Quetta Shura  ] in [LOC Pakistan  ] , but could not get a handle on the timing . 
[MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Outreach  ] ---------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Judd  ] added that he and his colleagues are “very , very worried” about [LOC Iran  ] . 
[ORG CSIS  ] recently talked to [ORG Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security  ] ( [ORG MOIS  ] ) after that agency requested its own channel of communication to [LOC Canada  ] , he said . 
The [MISC Iranians  ] agreed to “help” on [MISC Afghan  ] issues , including sharing information regarding potential attacks . 
However , “we have not figured out what they are up to , ” [PER Judd  ] confided , since it is clear that the “Iranians want [ORG ISAF  ] to bleed...slowly.” [LOC OTTAWA  ] 00000918 003.2 OF 003 <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 .
