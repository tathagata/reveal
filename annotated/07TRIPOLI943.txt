REASON: 1.4 ( c ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Charge met November 1 with [ORG MFA  ] Secretary for the Americas Dr. [PER Ahmed Fituri  ] and reiterated Post 's request for timely access to returned [LOC Guantanamo  ] detainee [MISC ISN-194  ] ( [PER Muhammad Abdallah Mansur  ] al-Rimi ) to follow up on ref A and B requests for further information on when and how al-Rimi sustained an injury to his left arm and suffered the loss of several teeth . 
The [ORG CDA  ] also requested access to [MISC ISN-557  ] ( [PER Ben Qumu Abu Sufian Ibrahim Ahmed Hamouda  ] ) , who was returned to [LOC Libya  ] September 26 , to assess his condition. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Fituri  ] stressed that it has been made clear that the ostensibly non-governmental [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] ( [ORG QDF  ] ) , headed by [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi , has the lead on facilitating access to returned detainees . 
He implied that the [ORG MFA  ] was not in a position to offer further assistance and recommended that the [ORG CDA  ] contact directly the [ORG QDF  ] 's Executive Director , Dr. [PER Yusuf Sawani  ] , and possibly ESO Chief [PER Musa Kusa  ] to follow up on the request for access to [MISC ISN-194  ] and [MISC ISN-557  ] . 
The [ORG CDA  ] pushed back , acknowledging that while the [ORG QDF  ] has been designated as the organization responsible for facilitating [ORG Watchdog Committee  ] access to returned detainees , the [ORG GOL  ] 's [ORG MFA  ] also has a role to play in helping to ensure that such access is granted . 
[ORG Fituri  ] offered no substantive rejoinder . 
Post has not been successful in its subsequent attempts to reach Dr. [PER Sawani  ] or our other [ORG QDF  ] interlocutors . 
( [PER Note: Sawani  ] and other [MISC Libyan  ] contacts are typically only reached by mobile telephone as many of their offices lack functioning landlines . 
Post suspects , but cannot confirm , that [PER Sawani  ] and his [ORG QDF  ] colleagues are not taking our numerous calls to avoid having to discuss this issue . 
End note .

( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Comment: [ORG CDA  ] met with Dr. [PER Sawani  ] in mid-September to request access to [MISC ISN-194  ] to follow up on ref B request for further information on the nature of his left hand disability and tooth loss . 
[PER Sawani  ] said [ORG QDF  ] employees ( [ORG NFI  ] ) conducted a " pre-interview " of [MISC ISN-194  ] in mid-September in anticipation of a second visit by Emboffs ( first visit reported ref E ) and were told by the detainee that he sustained an injury to his left arm during interrogation at [LOC GTMO  ] . 
Post notes that the first ( and only ) visit to [MISC ISN-194  ] came after two and a half months of negotiation with the [ORG GOL  ] and the [ORG QDF  ] . 
Post notes that the [ORG GOL  ] has expressed a strong desire for access to all/all [MISC Libyan  ] national detainees remaining in [LOC GTMO  ] ( ref D ) , and recommends that such access be explicitly conditioned on the [ORG GOL  ] 's facilitation of the requested visits with [MISC ISN-194  ] and [MISC ISN-557  ] .
