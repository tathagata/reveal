( [ORG S  ] ) Polmiloff discussed reftel points with [ORG MFA Senior Advisor for Nuclear Affairs  ] and [ORG Non-proliferation Ceta  ] [PER Noland  ] on September 28 . 
[PER Noland  ] claimed the points did not present any new information -- the [MISC Dutch  ] intelligence service [ORG AIVD  ] has been in close contact with [LOC U.S.  ] intelligence agencies regarding the case , and is therefore on top of the situation . 
She added that the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG MFA  ] is pushing the [ORG Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs  ] to issue a catch all in connection to [ORG Aviation Services International  ] 's apparent attempts to circumvent [MISC Dutch  ] and [ORG EU  ] export control restrictions. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Noland  ] noted , however , that a catch all issuance will be difficult , given the fact that [MISC Dutch  ] companies are not required under [MISC Dutch  ] law to apply for an export license for specific unmanned aerial vehicle ( UAV ) components . 
She said the [MISC Dutch  ] delegation will present on this topic at the [LOC MTCR  ] plenary intelligence exchange in [LOC Copenhagen  ] . 
[PER Noland  ] welcomed additional [LOC U.S.  ] information and cooperation on this case , and noted that [MISC Dutch  ] intelligence agencies will pass any new developments to their [LOC U.S.  ] counterparts .
