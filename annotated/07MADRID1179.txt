<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L MADRID 001179 SIPDIS SIPDIS EUR/WE FOR ALLEGRONE , [LOC CLEMENTS  ] , AND CERVETTI WHA/CCA FOR RIOS E.O. 12958: [LOC DECL:  ] 06/14/2017 TAGS: <a href='/tag/PREL_0.html'>PREL</a> <a href='/tag/SP_0.html'>SP</a> <a href='/tag/CU_0.html'>CU</a> SUBJECT: SPAIN/CUBA: [ORG LIBERTAD ACT  ] , [ORG TITLE III REF: STATE  ] 65523 Classified By: DCM [PER Hugo Llorens  ] for reason 1.4 ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [LOC Spain  ] is believed to be the largest foreign investor in [LOC Cuba  ] , though [MISC Spanish  ] companies avoid publishing precise data out of concern that such information will be used to further [LOC U.S.  ] enforcement actions under the [ORG Libertad Act  ] . 
[LOC Cuba  ] is the third-largest market for [LOC Spain  ] in [LOC Latin America  ] , after [LOC Mexico  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] , and [MISC Spanish  ] exports to [LOC Cuba  ] in 2006 were valued at 692 million euros , up from 489 million euros in 2005 . 
[LOC Spain  ] is also [LOC Cuba  ] 's second-largest supplier of non-petroleum goods , accounting for approximately 13 percent of [MISC Cuban  ] imports . 
However , the [ORG Zapatero  ] government has not reinstated the provision of risk insurance through the " [ORG Spanish Credit Insurance Company  ] " ( [ORG CESCE  ] ) for sales to and investments in [LOC Cuba  ] ; [ORG CESCE  ] suspended insurance for [LOC Cuba  ] due to delays in [LOC Cuba  ] 's repayment of $600 million in debts . 
[MISC Spanish  ] analysts believe two-way trade between [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] would increase by $200 million if [ORG CESCE  ] resumed insurance coverage for business deals with [LOC Cuba.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Although there is no indication that [ORG CESCE  ] insurance will be resumed in the near future , both [MISC Spanish  ] businesses and the [MISC Spanish  ] government believe [LOC Spain  ] has important long-term commercial interests in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
This perception , combined with strong cultural and family bonds between [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] , limits [LOC Spain  ] 's readiness to confront the [PER Castro  ] regime . 
There is also broad-based [MISC Spanish  ] antagonism towards the [ORG Libertad Act  ] and other [LOC Cuba  ] sanctions . 
This antagonism cuts across party lines ; both the ruling [ORG Socialist Party  ] and the opposition [ORG Popular Party  ] would likely seek retaliatory action by the [ORG EU  ] in the event of an enforcement action against a [ORG Spanish Company  ] under the [ORG Libertad Act.  ] //MEDIA COVERAGE OF EFFECTS OF [LOC U.S.  ] [LOC CUBA  ] SANCTIONS// <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [MISC Spanish  ] media have covered the complications resulting from the purchase by [LOC U.S.  ] companies of [MISC Spanish  ] tourism ventures with significant involvement in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
[MISC Spanish  ] companies send about 250,000 travelers to [LOC Cuba  ] on an annual basis , of whom approximately 192,000 are [MISC Spanish  ] citizens . 
Affected [MISC Spanish  ] companies include " [MISC Iberostar  ] " ( now " [LOC Orizonia  ] " ) , in which the [ORG Carlyle Group  ] purchased a 60 percent stake . 
[LOC Orizonia  ] controls several travel agencies that , prior to [LOC U.S.  ] investment , offered many travel packages to [MISC Cuban  ] destinations . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] cruise company " [MISC Pullmantur  ] " reportedly shifted its base of [LOC Caribbean  ] operations from [LOC Havana  ] to [LOC Puerto La Romana  ] in the [LOC Dominican Republic  ] after being purchased by [ORG Royal Caribbean  ] . 
Also , [MISC Boston-based  ] [ORG TA Associates  ] recently acquired the [MISC Spanish  ] company " eDreams , " [LOC Spain  ] 's country 's largest internet-based travel agency , which will presumably make it impossible for eDreams to continue booking travel to [LOC Cuba.  ] //RESPONSES TO NSC TASKING// <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Responses below are keyed to questions posed in reftel , paragraph 5: What is the nature of [MISC Spanish  ] investments in [LOC Cuba  ] ? : - The " [ORG Association of Spanish Companies  ] in [LOC Cuba  ] " ( [ORG AEEC  ] ) represents over 170 [MISC Spanish  ] businesses that trade with or invest in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
[MISC Spanish  ] companies , mostly small and medium sized businesses , account for approximately 25 percent of foreign investment in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
These companies are well aware of the potential for [LOC U.S.  ] legal action against them under the [ORG Libertad Act  ] and are careful to obscure information related to their investments in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
[MISC Spanish  ] companies are particularly active in tobacco , hotels and tourism , foodstuffs , construction , and light manufacturing .

We have no information regarding current operations in [LOC Cuba  ] by these companies. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) - Are there any bilateral trade agreements between [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] ? : There is a bilateral " [ORG Commission  ] on [ORG Economic-Industrial Cooperation  ] " between [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] that is intended to promote bilateral trade and investment . 
The work of the [ORG Commission  ] has been suspended for several years due to disputes over [LOC Cuba  ] 's non-payment of debt to [MISC Spanish  ] entities and other differences. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) - Are there any exchange programs between [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] ? : -- During the visit of [MISC Spanish  ] FM [PER Moratinos  ] to [LOC Cuba  ] in April 2007 [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] agreed to the resumption of [MISC Spanish  ] development aid to [LOC Cuba  ] . 
This assistance had been unilaterally suspended by [LOC Cuba  ] following [LOC Spain  ] 's criticism of the 2003 [MISC Cuban  ] crackdown on human rights activists . 
Over 90 percent of [MISC Spanish  ] development assistance to [LOC Cuba  ] comes from regional governments , with less than 10 percent provided by the central government . 
Such assistance is channeled primarily through the [MISC Cuban  ] government , and to a lesser degree through multilateral aid organizations. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) - Has [LOC Spain  ] worked to promote the advancement of democracy and human rights in [LOC Cuba  ] ? : -- [LOC Spain  ] , like the [LOC U.S.  ] , supports democratic objectives in [LOC Cuba  ] , but , unlike the [LOC U.S.  ] , believes that direct engagement with the authorities as well as with civil society will lead to more positive results in the island . 
[LOC Spain  ] 's view is conditioned by the experience of its own democratic transition ( which took place over more than five years ) . 
It is concerned that a rapid transition to democracy may lead to instability and violence . 
As a result , [LOC Spain  ] is focused on building relationships with potential successors to [PER Castro  ] , believing [LOC Spain  ] will be able to steer them in a positive direction after [PER Castro  ] 's death . 
This outlook limits [LOC Spain  ] 's willingness to take a tough stand against the [PER Castro  ] regime . 
-- Within the [ORG EU  ] , [LOC Spain  ] is unlikely to deviate from its support for continued engagement with the [MISC Cuban  ] government . 
The [MISC Embassy  ] , in coordination with the [ORG Department ,  ] has called on [MISC Spanish  ] officials to work with its [ORG EU  ] partners to issue a statement promoting democratic reforms in [LOC Cuba  ] , in light of the developing situation there . 
We have received mixed signals in response to this request , since some [MISC Spanish  ] officials argue that it is more important to preserve communication with [PER Castro  ] 's likely successors than it is to pressure them now for immediate changes. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) - Have there been any high level visits by [MISC Spanish  ] officials to [LOC Cuba  ] in the past six months ? : -- [MISC Spanish  ] FM [PER Miguel Angel Moratinos  ] visited [LOC Cuba  ] April 1-3 for meetings with [MISC Cuban  ] Vice President [PER Raul Castro  ] , FM [PER Felipe Perez Roque  ] , and other members of the [MISC Cuban  ] leadership . 
The visit triggered criticism by [MISC Cuban  ] human rights activists and by opposition political parties in [LOC Spain  ] , and intensified the internal divide in the [ORG EU  ] over [LOC Cuba  ] policy .
