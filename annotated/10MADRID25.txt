[PER Zapatero  ] , s developing agenda in [LOC Washington  ] includes a program at the [ORG Atlantic Council  ] , a possible address to the [ORG U.S. Chamber of Commerce  ] , and other meetings in which he wants to send an important message about [LOC Spain  ] , s [ORG EU  ] Presidency priorities and its commitment to the [MISC Transatlantic  ] partnership .

( C ) The Ambassador emphasized that his primary goal is to strengthen the partnership between [LOC Spain  ] and the [ORG USG  ] . 
President [PER Obama  ] needs the [ORG GOS  ] to be a reliable partner on the key issues of mutual interest , he said . 
The [ORG USG  ] appreciates that [LOC Spain  ] wants to help President [PER Obama  ] , but the [ORG USG  ] expects the [ORG GOS  ] will see that cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] is in [LOC Spain  ] 's interest and the interest of its [ORG NATO  ] allies . 
Speaking frankly , the Ambassador indicated that [LOC Spain  ] is viewed unevenly in the [ORG USG  ] . 
While many , including [ORG NSA Jones  ] , appreciate [LOC Spain  ] , s contributions and support over the last year , there is concern in some quarters about [LOC Spain  ] , s reliability , particularly on [LOC Kosovo  ] , [LOC Cuba  ] and elsewhere . 
[LOC Spain  ] would do well to make clear commitments and then follow through. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 .

There are several principal opportunities for close coordination and cooperation -- on [PER Guantanamo detainees  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Iran  ] -- where [LOC Spain  ] , s leadership , especially in the [ORG EU  ] Presidency , is particularly welcome .

[PER Leon  ] was not aware of any [ORG GOS  ] change of heart in this regard and undertook to clarify . 
He said that [MISC Spanish  ] law enforcement is carefully vetting proposed detainees for resettlement , noting however that [LOC Spain  ] , s very independent judiciary , and in particular its crusading investigative judges , are always poised to create problems for the government , especially on detainees . 
The [ORG GOS  ] is working to get the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG Congress  ] on board , and President [PER Zapatero  ] will appear before [ORG Congress  ] in February to make the government 's case .

( C ) [PER Leon  ] welcomed the Ambassador 's invitation to coordinate closely our messages on [LOC Afghanistan  ] , agreeing that the public needed to understand the direct link between the March 11 , 2004 , Atocha train bombings in [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
On [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Leon  ] said [LOC Spain  ] stands ready to support the [ORG USG  ] and added that [ORG UNSC  ] support will be instrumental to achieving our objectives . 
[PER Leon  ] said he had long been concerned about the proliferation effects from an unchecked [LOC Iran  ] , noting that [LOC Iran  ] , s actions threaten not only the [LOC Middle East  ] but also the [LOC Maghreb  ] on [LOC Spain  ] , s border . 
On the [LOC Middle East  ] , [PER Leon  ] underscored [LOC Spain  ] , s continued interest in helping promote peace , suggesting that a meeting of the Quartet on the margins of the prospective [LOC US-EU Summit  ] in [LOC Spain  ] could give some impetus to the peace process . 
The Ambassador said [LOC Spain  ] can help now by encouraging the [MISC Palestinians  ] to return to the bargaining table , noting that Special Envoy [PER Mitchell  ] is likely to ask FM Moratinos to encourage the [MISC Palestinians  ] in this regard during their January 12 meeting in [LOC Brussels  ] .

In closing , he mentioned that he was departing later that evening for a [MISC G-20  ] sherpas meeting in [LOC Mexico  ] , reiterating [LOC Spain  ] , s overriding national priority for [MISC G-20  ] membership . 
He said he was encouraged by Deputy [ORG National Security Advisor for International Economic Affairs Froman  ] , s openness in their recent meeting in [LOC Washington  ] to a formula that could include [LOC Spain  ] along with the [LOC UK  ] , [LOC Germany  ] , [LOC France  ] , [LOC Italy  ] , and the [ORG EU  ] . 
[PER Leon  ] said he is optimistic and described [LOC Spain  ] , s ongoing efforts to line up international support for its candidacy . 
While publicly none of the [MISC Europeans  ] would pick between the [LOC Netherlands  ] and [LOC Spain  ] , he said that privately they agree that the [LOC Netherlands  ] did not have a shot . 
While [PER Leon  ] did not think a definitive decision on [MISC G-20  ] membership would be taken in [LOC Mexico  ] , he is traveling there to make [LOC Spain  ] , s strong case . 
He asked the Ambassador to call [ORG Froman  ] to reiterate [LOC Spain  ] , s desire for [ORG USG  ] support .
