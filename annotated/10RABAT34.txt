First , he sought to reassure [PER Compaore  ] that [LOC Rabat  ] greatly appreciated his personal efforts to mediate the [LOC Guinea  ] crisis , his close coordination with [LOC Morocco  ] , and [LOC Burkina Faso  ] 's willingness to receive [PER Dadis  ] . 
Alluding to the [MISC Moroccan  ] [ORG MFA  ] 's bitterness over its perception that [PER Compaore  ] may have torpedoed [MISC French  ] , [MISC Moroccan  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to find an [MISC African  ] country to accept [PER Dadis  ] for resettlement -- and apparent [MISC Burkinabe  ] anger at [LOC Rabat  ] 's abrupt decision to send him by medical plane to [LOC Ouagadougou  ] ( Ref A ) -- [PER Bourita  ] said that [PER Mansouri  ] also calmed the waters with [PER Compaore  ] and secured agreement for continued future cooperation .

" [PER Camara  ] is unstable , and therefore dangerous , " he said ; for this reason , [LOC France  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] should take care not to " rush " the [ORG ICC  ] process . 
[LOC Morocco  ] does not support or accept impunity for [PER Dadis  ] , [PER Bourita  ] emphasized , but [LOC France  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC Morocco  ] and their [MISC African  ] partners " need to move at a rate that is in harmony with one another and that does not disturb the process .
