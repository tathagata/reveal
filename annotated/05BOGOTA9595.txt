( [ORG S  ] ) Former [MISC Ecuadorian  ] president [PER Lucio Gutierrez  ] told poloffs October 5 that he intends to return to [LOC Ecuador  ] , perhaps within weeks , and expects to be jailed on his arrival . 
[PER Gutierrez  ] said he wants to run for president in 2006 and would like the [LOC U.S.  ] to ensure that his life is protected while in jail and that any charges against him be tried fairly . 
His former foreign minister , [PER Patricio Zuquilanda  ] , hopes to travel to the [LOC U.S.  ] mid-October to brief the [ORG USG  ] on [PER Gutierrez  ] 's plans . 
End summary. --------------------------------------------- -------------- [PER Gutierrez  ] to Return to [LOC Ecuador  ] Soon , Plans Presidential Bid --------------------------------------------- -------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Former [MISC Ecuadorian  ] president [PER Lucio Gutierrez  ] told poloffs at a lunch October 5 that he would return to [LOC Ecuador  ] " as soon as possible " and expects to be arrested and imprisoned . 
" I am prepared to spend two , three , four months in jail to clear my name , " he said . 
According to [PER Gutierrez  ] , the [ORG GOE  ] has " persecuted " him and his family . 
The [ORG GOE  ] would not be able to prove any charges against him , he predicted . 
[PER Gutierrez  ] said he would go back " shortly " after a book launch in [LOC Bogota  ] October 12 . 
[PER Gutierrez  ] , who was accompanied by his former foreign minister [PER Patricio Zuquilanda  ] at the lunch hosted by prominent [MISC Colombian  ] political figure/businessman [PER David Turbay  ] , said he intended to run for president in October 2006 . 
He claimed that public and private polls suggest he has a solid chance of victory if allowed to run. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Gutierrez  ] said he expected the [MISC Ecuadorian  ] media to oppose his presidential bid , but with a less partisan tone than that which he claimed they displayed during his tenure . 
Both [PER Gutierrez  ] and [PER Zuquilanda  ] said the [MISC Ecuadorian  ] media felt somewhat chastened by their role in the events that led to [PER Gutierrez  ] fleeing the country in April 2005 . 
[PER Gutierrez  ] acknowledged that he has few funds to mount a TV campaign and suggested that he would instead run a " people 's campaign " that relied on personal meetings and rallies , although he implied that unnamed companies in [LOC Ecuador  ] would supply funds as well. ------------------------------------------- Free Speech and Political Asylum Conditions ------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Gutierrez  ] acknowledged that he faced certain restrictions on his conduct and speech while in [LOC Colombia  ] as a result of the [ORG GOC  ] 's October 4 decision to grant his request for political asylum . 
[PER Gutierrez  ] said he is not supposed to comment on internal [MISC Colombian  ] or [MISC Ecuadorian  ] politics , or do or say anything that would negatively affect [MISC Colombian-Ecuadorian  ] relations . 
He argued , however , that his planned October 12 book launch was an attempt to " set the record straight " on factual matters relating to his fall from power . 
He also said he would respond to any questions posed by journalists ; " I still have the right to free speech , " he said. -------------------------------- [PER Chavez  ] is Threat to Entire World -------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Gutierrez  ] and , especially , [PER Zuquilanda  ] , spent considerable time denouncing [MISC Venezuelan  ] president [PER Hugo Chavez  ] as a threat to " the entire world , not just [LOC South America  ] . 
" " We must unite as friends to combat [PER Chavez  ] , " [PER Zuquilanda  ] said on several occasions . 
[PER Zuquilanda  ] described a 2004 Cabinet meeting at which the [ORG GOE  ] Defense Minister informed the Cabinet that the [MISC Venezuelan  ] ambassador in [LOC Quito  ] was using his embassy to fund travel to and training in [LOC Venezuela  ] for [MISC Ecuadorian  ] radicals , whose objective was " [MISC Marxist  ] revolution " in [LOC Ecuador  ] . 
[PER Zuquilanda  ] said he called the ambassador in and told him he had in his desk a diplomatic note declaring the ambassador persona non grata unless he clarified the matter . 
[PER Zuquilanda  ] said the ambassador attempted weak explanations , then mumbled apologies , without denying the accusations . 
The ambassador said he would ensure nothing like it ever happened again. --------------------------------------------- ---------- [PER Gutierrez  ] Claims [LOC Ecuador  ] Heading in [LOC Anti-U.S  ] . 
Direction --------------------------------------------- ---------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Gutierrez  ] and [PER Zuquilanda  ] said that [MISC Ecuadorian  ] president [PER Palacio  ] intended to close down the [LOC U.S.  ] FOL at [LOC Manta  ] . 
If this happened , [PER Zuquilanda  ] said , it would be a " disaster " for the [LOC Manta  ] economy . 
In [PER Gutierrez  ] 's view , Economy Minister [PER Rafael Correa  ] is strongly anti-American and intends to run for president in 2006 an on a populist platform that would " target [MISC American  ] interests . 
" Both said that anti-American sentiment had increased in [LOC Ecuador  ] in recent years and argued that the [LOC U.S.  ] should " massively " increase public affairs efforts. --------------------- [ORG FARC Bases  ] in [LOC Ecuador  ] --------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Gutierrez  ] said " of course " the [ORG FARC  ] has bases in [LOC Ecuador  ] , but he said that when he was president he tried to attack them when discovered . 
[PER Gutierrez  ] said the 600km-plus border with [LOC Colombia  ] makes it tough to police ; " how can you tell who is and who is not [ORG FARC  ] if they all wear civilian clothes ? 
" he noted. ----------------------------------------- Former Foreign Minister Plans [ORG U.S. Travel  ] ----------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Zuquilanda  ] said he wanted to travel to the [LOC U.S.  ] during the second or third week of October to brief [ORG USG  ] officials on [PER Gutierrez  ] 's plans . 
When asked if that travel proposal meant that he would not return to [LOC Ecuador  ] until [PER Zuquilanda  ] returned , [PER Gutierrez  ] said , " no , I want to go back as soon as possible . 
" ------- Comment ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Gutierrez  ] seemed calm and did not appear concerned about being jailed , a prospect he clearly believes is likely . 
He did not ask for any [LOC U.S.  ] assistance , except to ensure that the [ORG GOE  ] protected him while in jail and , if possible , ensure that any charges against him were tried on the merits . 
[PER Zuquilanda  ] was considerably more " political " in his comments , evidently trying to persuade the [LOC U.S.  ] that the [LOC Gutierrez/Zuquilanda  ] combination would be a strong [LOC U.S  ] ally in combating [PER Chavez  ] and the [ORG FARC  ] .
