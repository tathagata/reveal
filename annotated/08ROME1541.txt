( U ) This is an action request . 
See para 3. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Action request: Embassy [LOC Vatican  ] requests the Department to explore designing and funding a crisis management tabletop exercise with the [LOC Vatican  ] security services . 
The purpose of the exercise is twofold: first , to enhance the [LOC Vatican  ] 's ability to respond to a crisis ; and , second , to foster a dialogue with the [LOC Vatican  ] on counter-terrorism . 
[ORG Al-Qaeda  ] has publicly identified the [PER Pope  ] and the [MISC Catholic  ] church as an enemy ( " Crusaders " ) , and [LOC Vatican City  ] attracts hundreds of thousands of [MISC American  ] citizen visitors each year , both tourists and pilgrims . 
For example , the [LOC Vatican  ] museums welcome up to 25,000 visitors each day , a substantial number of whom are [LOC U.S.  ] citizens . 
The [ORG RSO  ] , [ORG FBI  ] legal attachQ , and regional [LOC CT  ] coordinator at Embassy [LOC Rome  ] endorse this proposal , and Embassies [LOC Vatican  ] and [LOC Rome  ] are prepared to work with the [LOC Vatican  ] officials to shape the proposal , as appropriate . 
End Action Request. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) In recent years , the head of the [ORG Vatican Gendarmerie  ] , [PER Domenico Giani  ] , has on occasion solicited specific security training from the [ORG FBI  ] , most recently seeking explosives ordnance training for members of the [ORG Gendarmerie  ] at [LOC Quantico  ] . 
But , in general , [PER Giani  ] has been reluctant to engage in a comprehensive dialogue with the [LOC United States  ] about [LOC Vatican  ] capabilities and preparedness to respond to a terrorist attack . 
In November 2008 , however , Embassy [LOC Vatican  ] [ORG DCM  ] [PER Julieta Valls Noyes  ] spoke with [PER Giani  ] and proposed conducting a joint tabletop exercise on crisis management . 
[PER Giani  ] responded positively to this suggestion , which was presented during a conversation about [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] 's threat to the [LOC Vatican.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Comment: Due to the [LOC Holy See  ] 's sensitivity about being seen to be too close to any one state , it has been challenging to foster a security dialogue with [LOC Vatican City  ] officials that includes a comprehensive needs assessment . 
This is especially a concern given the high number of [MISC Americans  ] who visit [LOC Vatican City  ] each year , the known [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] antipathy to the [PER Pope  ] , and the [LOC Vatican  ] 's conviction that its facilities must be easily accessible to all [MISC Catholics  ] . 
[PER Giani  ] 's interest in a crisis management exercise offers an opportunity to open the door to a more substantial dialogue that would help the [LOC United States  ] be better placed to help the [LOC Vatican  ] prepare to deal with terrorist threats . 
End Comment .
