<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L TUNIS 002570 SIPDIS SENSITIVE SIPDIS FOR NEA/MAG ( [ORG HARRIS  ] ) AND NEA/IPA E.O. 12958: [LOC DECL:  ] 10/17/2016 TAGS: <a href='/tag/PREL_0.html'>PREL</a> <a href='/tag/KPAL_0.html'>KPAL</a> <a href='/tag/TS_0.html'>TS</a> SUBJECT: [ORG SUHA  ] [PER ARAFAT  ] ACQUIRES [MISC TUNISIAN  ] NATIONALITY REF: TUNIS 2565 Classified By: CDA [PER David Ballard  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Government of Tunisia  ] 's [ORG Official Journal of September  ] 26 published a notice that [PER Suha Arafat  ] , wife of the late [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] president , and her 11-year old daughter [PER Zahwa  ] had acquired [MISC Tunisian  ] nationality . 
[PER Mrs. Arafat  ] and her daughter have been living in [LOC Tunisia  ] since the 2004 death of [PER Yasser Arafat  ] , and [PER Zahwa  ] [PER Arafat  ] attends the [ORG American Cooperative School of Tunisia  ] . 
[PER Suha Arafat  ] 's presence in [LOC Tunisia  ] long predates that , however . 
She had been a resident of [LOC Tunisia  ] prior to her marriage , and , after residing in the [ORG Palestinian Territories  ] from 1996-98 , she returned in 1998 , alternating between residences in [LOC France  ] and [LOC Tunisia.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The above news item has been picked up by various media outlets , including [ORG Reuters  ] . 
Other recent wire reports on [PER Mrs. Arafat  ] , reporting her alleged marriage to [PER Belhassen Trabelsi  ] , the brother-in-law of [MISC Tunisian  ] President [PER Zine El Abidine Ben Ali  ] , are false , however , and [PER Mrs. Arafat  ] has been quite vocal in denying them in the press. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Comment: We remain puzzled as to why [PER Mrs. Arafat  ] would want [MISC Tunisian  ] citizenship , and why now , since she already enjoyed the privilege of a [MISC Tunisian  ] diplomatic passport , and we doubt that she was eager to exercise her right to vote in [LOC Tunisia  ] or become a member of the [ORG Tunisian National Assembly  ] . 
The only other tangible benefit of citizenship is that [MISC Tunisian  ] law forbids foreigners to own agricultural land -- and [PER Mrs. Arafat  ] is not known to be an aspiring farmer . 
One possible motivation is that under [MISC Tunisian  ] law , foreign participation in a totally non-exporting service industry cannot exceed 50 percent . 
Several months ago , [PER Mrs. Arafat  ] set up one such company -- to build an international school in [LOC Tunis  ] . 
[MISC Tunisian  ] citizenship will allow her to control this company . 
As for what was in such a move for the [ORG GOT  ] , Post suspects that a continuing desire on the part of the government to market itself as closely tied to the [MISC Palestinian  ] people played a role . 
The [ORG GOT  ] probably feels the need for some [MISC Palestinian  ] " cover " during this time when newspapers are full of stories on the government 's campaign against the hijab ( reftel ) . 
In addition , [PER Mrs. Arafat  ] is said to be good friends with the [ORG First Lady  ] , [PER Leila Ben Ali  ] .
