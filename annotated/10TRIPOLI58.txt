Cretz  ] , Ambassador , [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: In a January 19 meeting with [LOC UK  ] , [MISC Italian  ] , and [MISC French  ] counterparts , the xxxxxxxxxxxx told A/DCM that the [LOC UK  ] believes that cancer-ridden [LOC Lockerbie  ] bomber [PER Abdel Basset  ] al-Megrahi has less than four weeks to live . 
The [LOC UK  ] has reportedly asked the [ORG GOL  ] to keep al-Megrahi 's funeral " low key , " but is not optimistic that it will be . 
The [MISC Italian  ] and [MISC French  ] [ORG DCM  ] 's discussed a brewing visa crisis that the [MISC Schengen  ] states are facing with the [MISC Libyans  ] - in an effort to get two [MISC Swiss  ] businessmen out of [LOC Libya  ] , the [MISC Swiss  ] are now blocking all [MISC Schengen  ] visas for [MISC Libyan  ] government officials , [PER Qadhafi  ] family members , and prominent businesspeople . 
As a result , most [MISC European  ] embassies in [LOC Tripoli  ] are issuing bilateral visas for [MISC Libyans  ] whose [MISC Schengen  ] applications have been blocked . 
The [ORG GOL  ] is not satisfied with such bilateral visas , and has threatened [MISC Schengen  ] states with " reciprocity " ( presumably the blockage of [MISC Libyan  ] visas for their nationals ) if the situation is not resolved . 
On possible coming changes within the [ORG GOL  ] , the [LOC UK  ] feels that [PER Qadhafi  ] son [PER Saif  ] al-Islam ( reportedly now in [LOC London  ] for a 2 week trip ) is unlikely to accept the " General Coordinator " position at the upcoming General People 's [ORG Congress  ] , while the [MISC French  ] are convinced that he will . 
UNGA President [PER Ali Abdussalam Treki  ] is in [LOC London  ] January 19-20 for meetings with [ORG FCO  ] regarding [ORG UN  ] reform , and to meet with Quartet Representative and former PM [PER Tony Blair  ] , presumably to discuss peace process issues . 
End summary. --------------------------------------------- ------- [LOC UK  ] BELIEVES MEGRAHI DEATH IMMINENT --------------------------------------------- ------- 2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) xxxxxxxxxxxx noted that the [LOC UK  ] Embassy had been told by " a source very close to al-Megrahi 's family , " that the [LOC Lockerbie  ] bomber is in the " final stages " and has " no more than 3-4 weeks to live . 
" This information was provided to the [LOC UK  ] Embassy 10 days ago , implying that by now , al-Megrahi has 2-3 weeks left . 
[ Note: This information is speculative , and does not come from a medical professional . 
End note ] . 
According to xxxxxxxxxxxx , the [LOC UK  ] Embassy has asked [ORG GOL  ] to keep the funeral low-key , but is not optimistic that it will be . 
The [LOC UK  ] is particularly concerned about the " high likelihood " of TV cameras filming footage of the funeral to play on [MISC Libyan  ] TV , which would then " near inevitably " be picked up by international news outlets. --------------------------------------------- --- [MISC SWISS  ] UPDATE AND [MISC SCHENGEN  ] WOES --------------------------------------------- --- 3 . 
( C ) According to the [MISC Italian  ] and [MISC French  ] [ORG DCM  ] 's , the [MISC Swiss  ] are currently blocking all [MISC Schengen  ] visas for [MISC Libyan  ] diplomats , military officials , [PER Qadhafi  ] family members , and prominent [MISC Libyan  ] businesspeople . 
To date , " dozens of key visas " have been blocked . 
Other [MISC Europeans  ] are issuing bilateral visas to those [MISC Libyans  ] refused [MISC Schengens  ] , but the [MISC Libyans  ] are not satisfied with that , and have threatened " reciprocal measures " if the other [MISC Europeans  ] don't start issuing [MISC Schengen  ] visas without [MISC Swiss  ] approval ( something that is regulatorily impossible for the other [MISC Europeans  ] to do ) . 
The [ORG DCM  ] 's said that it is unclear what the threatened reciprocal measures will be , but that the [ORG GOL  ] convoked several [MISC European  ] diplomats to the [MISC MFA  ] last week to inform them of [MISC Libyan  ] upset over the situation . 
While the [MISC Europeans  ] are feeling " increasingly inconvenienced " by [MISC Swiss  ] blockage of [MISC Schengens  ] , all are sympathetic , and none have protested [MISC Swiss  ] actions . 
The [MISC Swiss  ] reportedly circulated a diplomatic note in [LOC Brussels  ] to all [MISC Schengen  ] members a few weeks ago , explaining that they are blocking the visas of all [MISC Libyans  ] " connected " to the arrests of the 2 [MISC Swiss  ] citizens in [LOC Libya  ] . 
Representatives of all members of the [MISC Schengen  ] group may meet in [LOC Brussels  ] sometime over the next few weeks to discuss the issue . 
4 . 
( C ) The [MISC French  ] and [LOC UK  ] [ORG DCM  ] 's confirmed reports that the [MISC Germans  ] are working on negotiating between the [MISC Libyans  ] and [MISC Swiss  ] to resolve the crisis between the two countries , but noted that the senior [MISC German  ] officials involved do not want to come to [LOC Tripoli  ] for further meetings unless they are " guaranteed of success , " which they have not yet been assured of. ------------------------------- COMING [ORG GOL  ] CHANGES ? ------------------------------- 5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Based on conversations with " well-informed [MISC Libyans  ] , " the [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000058 002 OF 002 [LOC UK  ] xxxxxxxxxxxx feels it is " unlikely " that [PER Saif  ] al-Islam [PER Qadhafi  ] will accept the General Coordinator job at the upcoming General People 's [ORG Congress  ] ( due to be held in February , although the exact date has not yet been announced ) . 
The [MISC French  ] have heard exactly the opposite from their sources - [PER Saif  ] will definitely take the job - while the [MISC Italians  ] noted that [PER Saif  ] 's behaviour and intense apparently leisure travel schedule in recent weeks " has not exactly been that of someone about to assume control of a government . 
" The [LOC UK  ] has been told by an " excellent source in [MISC MFA  ] " that [PER Mohamed Abulqasim Al Zawi  ] , current [MISC Libyan  ] Ambassador to [LOC Morocco  ] and the former [MISC Libyan  ] Ambassador to the [LOC UK  ] ( who re-opened the [MISC Libyan  ] Embassy in [LOC London  ] in 1999 ) , will be appointed the new Secretary of the General People 's [ORG Congress  ] . 
All of the [ORG DCM  ] 's had heard reports that [MISC Libyan  ] PM-equivalent [MISC Al-Baghdadi  ] [PER Ali Al-Mahmoudi  ] may be replaced by current [ORG National Oil Company  ] chairman [PER Shukri Ghanim  ] , but none were sure of the reliability of such information. ------------------------------ [MISC LIBYANS  ] ON THE MOVE ------------------------------ 6 . 
( C ) According to the [LOC UK  ] [ORG DCM  ] , [PER Saif  ] al-Islam is currently in [LOC London  ] , and just bought a house in [LOC Hampstead  ] . 
He 's likely to be there " for another 2 weeks . 
" UNGA President [PER Treki  ] is in [LOC London  ] January 19-20 , for meetings with [ORG FCO  ] regarding [ORG UN  ] reform . 
He is likely to also meet with Quartet Representative [PER Tony Blair  ] , presumably to discuss peace process issues . 
According to the [MISC Italians  ] , FM Kusa will likely go to [LOC Rome  ] next week for a few days of meetings .
