C ) 2004 [LOC MADRID  ] 4554 [ORG Classified By: Political  ] Counselor [PER Kathy Fitzpatrick  ] ; reasons 1.4 ( B ) a nd ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) [LOC Spain  ] is among the most important foreign investors in [LOC Cuba  ] and the ruling Socialist party has continued the [ORG Popular Party  ] 's policy of encouraging further investment and trade with [LOC Cuba  ] . 
On human rights issues , the [ORG GOS  ] has broken with the [MISC Aznar  ] administration 's emphasis on support for democracy activists in favor of seeking greater dialogue with the [PER Castro  ] regime . 
Within the [ORG EU  ] , [LOC Spain  ] successfully advocated the suspension of the [ORG EU  ] 's policy of inviting dissidents to [ORG EU  ] national day events , calling the invitations a major impediment to normal contact with the [MISC Cuban  ] authorities. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The [ORG EU  ] decision to suspend the Restrictive Measures will be reviewed this month in [LOC Brussels  ] and the [ORG GOS  ] will likely try to claim that the suspension has had a positive effect in [LOC Cuba  ] and should be maintained ( Ref B ) . 
[MISC Spanish  ] officials claim that their policy of engagement won the [ORG GOC  ] 's release of 14 political prisoners in 2004 , as well as the [ORG GOC  ] 's decision to allow former political prisoner [PER Raul Rivero  ] to exit [LOC Cuba  ] ( and take up residence in [LOC Spain  ] ) and to permit the May 20 opposition gathering in [LOC Havana  ] to take place . 
The [ORG GOS  ] also takes credit for two meetings in [LOC Havana  ] in the first six months of 2005 between [ORG EU  ] chiefs of mission and [MISC Cuban  ] opposition figures . 
MFA officials insist that these meetings , part of what they describe as a " structured dialogue " between the [ORG EU  ] and [MISC Cuban  ] democracy activists , are important symbols of [ORG EU  ] support for human rights and democratic reforms in [LOC Cuba.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Post continues to engage [ORG GOS  ] interlocutors to convey the [ORG USG  ] 's strong concern that increased [ORG EU  ] engagement with the regime has strengthened , not weakened , [PER Castro  ] 's hold on political power at the expense of the opposition . 
However , it is not likely that the [PER Zapatero  ] government will veer from its current [LOC Cuba  ] policy in the near to medium term . 
[LOC Madrid  ] has a substantial political and economic stake in [LOC Cuba  ] and appears resigned to [PER Castro  ] 's continued leadership . 
Therefore , [PER Zapatero  ] will continue to favor a strategy that limits the possibility of [ORG EU  ] conflict with [PER Castro  ] and will subordinate human rights concerns to its broader interests . 
The [ORG GOS  ] will also seek to maintain its role as the key [ORG EU  ] interlocutor with [LOC Havana  ] . 
[MISC Cuban  ] Foreign Minister [PER Felipe Perez Roque  ] visited [LOC Madrid  ] in March to meet with high level [ORG GOS  ] officials , including President [PER Zapatero  ] and [PER Fidel Castro  ] has been invited to participate in the [MISC Ibero American  ] [ORG Summit  ] in [LOC Salamanca  ] , [LOC Spain  ] in October . 
While some in [LOC Spain  ] , including the [ORG Popular Party  ] , oppose this increased level of engagement , all political forces would oppose the implementation of [ORG Title III of the Libertad Act  ] with regard to [MISC Spanish  ] companies. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) [MISC Spanish  ] businesses are well aware of the potential of [LOC U.S.  ] legal action against them under the [ORG Libertad Act  ] and take care to obscure precise invormation regarding their investments in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
However , we have obtained the following general information regarding the major [MISC Spanish  ] investors in [LOC Cuba:  ] -- [ORG Grupo Sol Melia: Hotel/Tourism  ] industry .
