( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY: The first anniversary of the murder of [MISC Theo  ] van [ORG Gogh passed  ] with lightly attended memorial events , but the most durable memorial is a heated and constant discussion in the government , the press and on the streets about integration , [MISC Islam  ] , immigrants , and terrorism . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Family and friends of [MISC Theo  ] van [ORG Gogh and the City of Amsterdam  ] organized several memorial events on November 2 to commemorate van [ORG Gogh 's  ] life , encourage better understanding among native [MISC Dutch  ] and ethnic [MISC Dutch  ] , and to emphasize the importance of freedom of speech , as they consider van [ORG Gogh died  ] for speaking out freely , if imprudently. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Prime Minister [PER Balkenende  ] and [LOC Amsterdam  ] Mayor [PER Job Cohen  ] attended a memorial ceremony held at the same hour and location as last year 's murder . 
[PER Balkenende  ] called for tolerance and not letting go of each other . 
He also argued that , No one in the [LOC Netherlands  ] should be afraid to give his opinion . 
[PER Cohen  ] too stressed the importance of freedom and mutual understanding. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In the afternoon the [LOC City  ] organized an event at which Mayor [PER Cohen  ] and van [ORG Gogh 's  ] father spoke , followed by a debate on how Amsterdammers of all backgrounds should live with each other . 
At other locations in the city as well , debates , commemoration services and seminars were organized that brought together publicists , politicians , [MISC Muslim  ] community leaders and integration experts to discuss ethnic tension in society , the role of the media , the ideological motives of [MISC Muslim  ] extremists , as well as the need to protect freedom of speech . 
POLICTICALLY CORRECT NO MORE --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) A year after the event , much of the rage on both sides is gone , as is the political correctness that framed the debate for the decades leading up to van [ORG Gogh 's  ] murder . 
Emboff attended a lecture on [MISC Muslim  ] minorities in [MISC Western  ] liberal democracies by [MISC American  ] Professor [PER Francis Fukuyama  ] earlier this fall . 
An elegant native [MISC Dutch  ] woman stood up during the question and answer session and said: Let 's be honest: [MISC Muslims  ] are the problem . 
The audience reacted with nervous laughter and chatter . 
These sentiments have become a common refrain for many native [MISC Dutch  ] . 
RESULTS QUESTIONABLE -------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Despite the debate and resulting initiatives to better the situation , the results have been lackluster . 
A recent poll among residents in large [MISC Dutch  ] cities with sizeable minority populations confirmed the perception in each ethnic group that the gulf between native [MISC Dutch  ] and immigrants has widened since van [ORG Gogh 's  ] murder . 
The [MISC Muslim  ] community , especially [LOC Turks  ] and [MISC Moroccans  ] , views [MISC Dutch  ] society as increasingly hostile . 
As [LOC Green Left  ] party leader [PER Femke Halsema  ] said after the murder of van [ORG Gogh , [ Immigrants  ] ] have lost confidence in [MISC Dutch  ] society . 
Dutchborn and raised [MISC Moroccans  ] suddenly feel strangers in their own country . 
People are increasingly alienated and lonely . 
ONUS ON THE IMMIGRANTS ---------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Many native [MISC Dutch  ] citizens believe that the duty to integrate falls primarily on the shoulders of immigrants , including second generation [MISC Dutch  ] citizens of ethnic descent . 
During a meeting with Emboff November 9 , prominent [MISC Dutch  ] sociologist [PER Dr. Han Entzinger  ] said , [MISC Dutch  ] society sees itself on the receiving end of immigrants ; especially the government . 
Society does not believe it needs to be more welcoming to newcomers . 
All the same , there is increased awareness since the murder that both segments of society must live together and should therefore take more consideration of each other. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) COMMENT: Van [PER Gogh  ] has become a symbol for free speech , and the need to defend it . 
His murder has triggered heated debate on how to deal with those who challenge such core [MISC Dutch  ] values . 
The debate touches on the underlying question of how to deal with [MISC Islam  ] in a secularized and individualized western society like the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
The debate continues , and many educational , socioeconomic and housing initiatives have been established to address segregation in [MISC Dutch  ] society . 
For now , however , [MISC Muslims  ] and non-Muslims continue to live mostly segregated lives . 
There is concern from both sides over what might happen next .
