( C ) Summary . 
Pol/Econ Chief and FCS were summoned , along with a handful of other foreign diplomats , to the Prime Minister-equivalent 's office August 2 for a meeting with his director for cooperation and [ORG Ministry-equivalent of Economy  ] officials to discuss the latter ministry 's implementation of a law dating back to 2004 , which stipulates that all foreign distributors must work through 100-percent Libyan-owned and operated trade agents in order to operate in [LOC Libya  ] . 
The officials emphasized that the law had not yet been implemented in order to give companies an " opportunity to adjust their practices " independently . 
According to the law , all foreign distributors must work with [MISC Libyan  ] agents only - no third country nationals - and must develop plans for expansion from [LOC Tripoli  ] to the cities of [LOC Benghazi  ] , [LOC Sebha  ] , and [ORG Sirte  ] . 
The law is likely to create conditions that prohibit small and medium sized distributors from investing in [LOC Libya  ] and may cause some foreign companies to withdraw from the market . 
This and other efforts to impose old and new regulations may reflect a stepped-up effort by the [ORG GOL  ] to gain some control over its helter skelter approach to development which enabled a rush of foreign companies to enter the country . 
End Summary . 
2 . 
( C ) The Prime Minister-equivalent 's ( [ORG PM  ] ) office summoned Economic/Commercial Counselors from the [MISC Italian  ] , [MISC German  ] , [MISC French  ] , [MISC Chinese  ] , [MISC South Korean  ] , and [MISC Japanese  ] embassies , in addition to Pol/Econ Chief and FCS , August 2 for an unplanned meeting to discuss " trade-related issues . 
" [ Note: The [ORG PM  ] 's office first summoned the ambassadors of the above listed countries , later downgrading attendance after it was clear that the [ORG PM  ] would not be able to attend the meeting . 
End Note . 
] Chaired by the [ORG PM  ] 's director for cooperation , [PER Issam Zawia  ] , and [PER Dia Hammouda  ] , the director of the same office at the [ORG Ministry-equivalent of Economy  ] ( [ORG MOE  ] ) , the purpose of the meeting was to clarify the meaning and intent of Law [MISC Number Six of 2004  ] , which governs transactions between foreign distributors and local trade agents in [LOC Libya  ] . 
The law stipulates that each foreign distributor seeking to introduce its product in [LOC Libya  ] must deal with a 100-percent locally owned and operated trade agent . 
Specifically , [PER Hammouda  ] wanted to ensure that the embassies representing the " industrialized nations " in [LOC Libya  ] were aware that the [ORG Ministry was  ] in the process of executing the law and would be preparing enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance . 
The purpose of the late imposition of the law , according to [PER Hammouda  ] , was to allow foreign companies the time necessary to adjust their operating practices independently . 
As few companies had done so , the [ORG Ministry decided  ] that it was time to enforce the law . 
[PER Hammouda  ] outlined his [ORG Ministry  ] 's interest in both creating a regulated , favorable , and transparent operating environment for foreign investors , as well as fighting corruption . 
He said that he would convene other meetings with the directors of foreign distributorships currently operating in [LOC Libya  ] , as well as with local agents , in the near future . 
In response to an inquiry from one of the diplomats in attendance , [PER Hammouda  ] set a nominal deadline of the end of the year for compliance with the law but later backed away from that date . 
3 . 
( C ) In addition to the first point of law that [PER Hammouda  ] highlighted , he noted that Law [MISC Number Six  ] required each foreign distributor to develop plans to establish distribution facilities in four areas: [LOC Tripoli  ] , [LOC Benghazi  ] , [LOC Sebha  ] , and [ORG Sirte  ] . 
Moreover , each distributor must deal with a distinct trade agent in each city , for the purpose of expanding investment across the country . 
When several diplomats protested the difficulties that companies would face in trying to establish multiple operation sites with unrelated agents , [PER Hammouda  ] clarified that companies must merely have plans for expansion and that the government did not expect foreign distributors to open four sites at once . 
He stated that distributors would have time to settle into the local market before expanding and that expansion could be down slowly , in consultation with the [ORG MOE  ] . 
4 . 
( C ) Several diplomats debated the logic of the law with [PER Hammouda  ] for the greater part of two hours , particularly regarding the expansion requirement in four different areas with four different agents . 
The [MISC South Korean  ] diplomat also noted the difficulties that companies might face if forced to break long-term contracts with local agents . 
The [MISC German  ] diplomat [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000620 002.2 OF 002 noted that many countries around the world allow foreign distributors to write exclusive contracts with a single local agent in order to better organize their business plans , to which [PER Hammouda  ] responded " [LOC Libya  ] is not like other countries " and must develop its own laws to fit its environment . 
5 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Hammouda  ] seemed intent on [LOC Libya  ] 's enforcing the 2004 law , though his backtracking on a deadline and lack of a clear enforcement strategy reflected some confusion regarding whether the law could actually be implemented . 
It was also clear that the [ORG MOE  ] lacks a strategy for confronting the problems that will arise when the law is implemented . 
The most immediate effects of the law for [LOC U.S.  ] trade will be seen in the [MISC Caterpillar  ] negotiations ( reftel ) , in terms of whether the [ORG MOE  ] will force the company to abide by the expansion requirement . 
The positive news , if any , is that the law will be applied across the board among the major investors in [LOC Libya  ] ( though the lack of [LOC UK  ] participation in the meeting was notable ) . 
A well-connected contact in the business and government world here believes this is yet another in a series of [ORG GOL  ] attempts ( haphazard as they are ) to gain control over the helter-skelter approach it has taken to developing its infrastructure through its heretofore open welcome-mat for foreign companies .
