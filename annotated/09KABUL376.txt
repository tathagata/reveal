<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 [LOC KABUL  ] 000376 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 02/16/2019 TAGS PGOV , [ORG PREL  ] , [ORG PTER  ] , [ORG SNAR  ] , [ORG AF  ] , [ORG PK  ] , IR SUBJECT: PRESIDENT KARZAI PREVIEWS STRATEGIC REVIEW IDEAS FOR USD/P [PER FLOURNOY  ] <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C [LOC NF  ] ) President [PER Karzai  ] on February 15 told Undersecretary of Defense for Policy [PER Flournoy  ] that his government welcomed the opportunity to join in the [MISC USG’s  ] strategic policy review . 
He suggested his team likely would advocate for: 1 ) greater efforts to target terrorist leaders and sanctuaries in [LOC Pakistan  ] ; 2 ) additional work to strengthen [MISC Afghan  ] communities to enhance security ; and 3 ) new multilateral talks with individual groups of [MISC Taliban  ] who agree to respect the [MISC Afghan  ] constitution . 
On the contentious issue of civilian casualties , [PER Karzai  ] expressed satisfaction with the recent agreement on specific military operations and a willingness to move forward . 
The President predicted [LOC Iran  ] would respond positively to the new [LOC US  ] administration’s offers of dialog. ----------------- FOCUS ON [LOC PAKISTAN  ] ----------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C [LOC NF  ] ) The fight for stability in [LOC Afghanistan  ] must be taken to the terrorist planners and their sanctuaries in [LOC Pakistan  ] , [PER Karzai  ] said . 
He noted he had long argued for greater efforts in this direction , including in public remarks in [LOC Kabul  ] in 2005 . 
[PER Karzai  ] expressed frustration that the close relationship between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] had yet to yield a serious campaign against terrorist leaders operating there . 
Instead , he argued , [LOC Afghanistan  ] paid the price of perceived [LOC US  ] and [MISC Pakistani  ] reluctance to grapple with the problem . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] , of course , had long used [MISC Islamic  ] fundamentalism as a policy tool . 
But “Pakistan is a puzzle to me now , ” [PER Karzai  ] admitted. “I see things happening on a massive scale in the northwest that are not the work of [ORG ISI  ] , ” the [MISC Pakistani  ] intelligence service. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C [LOC NF  ] ) On cooperation between [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] , [PER Karzai  ] said , “Zardari is of a different ( positive ) mindset.” The [MISC Pakistani  ] President has yet to move , however , from good intentions to implementation , and is weak . 
[PER Karzai  ] asked [PER Flournoy  ] whether the [LOC US  ] strategic review envisioned more direct bilateral military cooperation between [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] , with the [LOC US  ] or [ORG NATO  ] as broker , or whether only greater [MISC US-Pakistan  ] military cooperation was under consideration . 
[PER Flournoy  ] replied that the regional strategic review , while urgent and extremely important to the new [LOC US  ] administration , was only just underway. ----------------------- RENEW COMMUNITY SUPPORT ----------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C [LOC NF  ] ) The President underscored his analysis that the support of communities was key to countering the insurgency . 
When I first returned to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Karzai  ] mused , I had only 14 [MISC American  ] soldiers with me . 
But we had the [MISC Afghan  ] people with us , they believed in the moral correctness of what we were doing , and even [LOC Helmand  ] was safe for girls to go to school . 
Now , 4000 ( sic ) [MISC British  ] soldiers are in [LOC Helmand  ] , and the people are not safe. “We must stand on a higher moral platform than the bad guys , ” the President said. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C [LOC NF  ] ) Community empowerment is not about the arming the tribes , [PER Karzai  ] noted . 
Media speculation about this approach is misleading . 
We need ordinary people , the elders and the villagers , to trust in the government’s ability to do the right thing , and give them what they need to be able to defend themselves , the President said . 
In turn , the government must minimize civilian casualties , limit night raids , and make sure women and children are protected during military operations . 
Increasing the numbers and capabilities of the police and army , and strengthening government institutions , are also important , [PER Karzai  ] added. ---------------------- TALK TO AFHGAN [MISC TALIBAN  ] ---------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C [LOC NF  ] ) [LOC Afghanistan  ] and the [LOC US  ] together should formally launch a process of peace-making with those [MISC Taliban  ] who are not al [PER Qaeda  ] or part of any terrorist network , [PER Karzai  ] proposed . 
There are groups and individuals who would accept the [MISC Afghan  ] constitution , who have “run away” from us because of our own failings , he said . 
[LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , [LOC Pakistan  ] , and religious leaders have the right resources to make such a process work and should participate . 
But [LOC US  ] partnership with [LOC Afghanistan  ] is key to success and has been the missing element in efforts to date. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C [LOC NF  ] ) If there really was a [MISC Taliban  ] movement , [PER Karzai  ] said , I would be greatly worried by [LOC US  ] reports that [LOC Iran  ] is supporting the [MISC Taliban  ] . 
But I do not think the [MISC Taliban  ] is really a movement . 
It is the result of three decades of past [MISC Pakistani  ] policy , plus a lot of poor , desperate kids who lack [LOC KABUL  ] 00000376 002 OF 002 connection to a family or community. ------------------------- FRIENDS DESPITE FRICTIONS ------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C [LOC NF  ] ) On several topics , [PER Karzai  ] said , recent frictions in the bilateral relationship represent “annoyances” between “friends.” “We have been hurt by some recent statements , ” he said , and also I know my “loud speeches” on civilian casualties hurt your feelings . 
Still , the two nations have common interests , and the two peoples are friends . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] is very grateful for the generosity of [LOC US  ] aid in reconstruction and development . 
The agreement on civilian casualties is a “good start” and we can now move forward to implement it and so speak with one voice on this issue . 
On [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Karzai  ] said , [LOC Afghanistan  ] cannot be a channel , but we can help you convey the nuances of your demands . 
[LOC Iran  ] is likely to respond positively to [LOC US  ] offers of dialog even though it will never give up its nuclear programs . 
Progress in curbing poppy cultivation this year probably largely reflects market forces such as high wheat prices . 
[MISC Afghans  ] consider poppy “not respectable , ” however , and with stability and hope for the future will respond to international efforts to replace its cultivation with alternate livelihoods. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Comment: Coming in the immediate aftermath of Special Representative Holbrooke’s visit , this meeting reflected Karzai’s effort to stick by his agreement to re-found the relationship . 
His calm , constructive comments on civilian casualties contrast sharply to his attitude previously. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) Undersecretary [PER Flournoy  ] cleared this cable .
