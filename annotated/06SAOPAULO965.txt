The following day he met separately with the heads of the [MISC Brazilian  ] subsidiaries of two major [LOC U.S.  ] companies as well as the Vice President for [LOC Latin America  ] of the [ORG Motion Picture Association  ] . 
He also attended a lunch at the [ORG American Chamber of Commerce  ] and made remarks with the [ORG AMCHAM  ] board and other influential private sector leaders in attendance . 
The Ambassador exchanged views on a range of economic and political issues , discussed possible strategies for expanding trade and investment , and explored the possibilities for corporate responsibility activities in the private sector . 
End Summary. ------------ [ORG GM OF BRASIL  ] ------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] met privately with [PER Ray G. Young  ] , President and Managing director of [ORG GM of Brasil  ] since January , 2004 , who also sits on [ORG GM  ] 's [LOC Latin America  ] , [LOC Africa  ] and [LOC Middle East Strategy Board  ] . 
[PER Young  ] expressed enthusiasm for the current [MISC Brazilian  ] economy , the outlook for [ORG GM  ] 's operations in the country , and the adaptability of the [MISC Brazilian  ] worker . 
According to [PER Young  ] , the outlook for [ORG GM  ] in [LOC Brazil  ] is excellent . 
If the current GDP growth levels of the last 3-4 years are maintained , or , better yet , if the economy can grow 5 percent annually while remaining stable , [ORG GM  ] will be able to continue to operate profitably . 
His three recommendations to the [ORG GoB  ] would be: ( 1 ) establish growth targets ( of 5 percent annually ) and then prepare a business plan to achieve this goal ; ( 2 ) implement tax reform and reduce government inefficiency in order to help achieve the goal ; and ( 3 ) make education a high priority to help continue to develop a qualified , skilled work force to meet the challenges of globalization and a continually changing economy . 
3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG GM  ] of [LOC Brasil  ] has 21,000 employees . 
Seventy percent of its market is domestic , with foreign sales accounting for the other 30 percent . 
The company plans to double its engineering staff in order to export engineering services . 
[PER Young  ] believes that if [ORG GM  ] had access to [MISC Asian  ] markets it would be competitive there . 
He stressed the importance of competitiveness and of " opening one 's eyes " to market opportunities . 
In his opinion , [LOC Brazil  ] should be a global player and should begin to use new business models . 
[ORG GM  ] is well respected in the community and has not encountered any anti-Americanism in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
The night prior to his meeting with the Ambassador , [PER Young  ] and [MISC CEOs  ] of other major companies attended a dinner with President [PER Lula  ] , who was seeking feedback on issues of concern to the business community and ideas on opportunities for the next administration. --------- [ORG GE BRASIL  ] --------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ambassador also met privately with [PER Alexandre G. Silva  ] , President and CEO of [ORG GE Brasil  ] since October 2001 as well as Vice President of the [ORG AMCHAM Board  ] . 
[ORG GE  ] is a thriving company in [LOC Brazil  ] with 6,000 employees , and expects 20 percent growth by the year 2010 . 
In [LOC Latin America  ] , [ORG GE  ] predicts growth of more than 30 percent by 2010 , compared to 25 percent in [LOC China  ] and 20 in [LOC India  ] . 
[ORG GE  ] 's aircraft overhaul business is very profitable in [LOC Brazil  ] , due to the [ORG SAO PAULO  ] 00000965 002 OF 003 cost-efficient facilities , talented labor force , and growing number of contracts with [LOC U.S.  ] air carriers ( Southwest , [ORG UPS  ] , and others ) . ---------------------------------- DIFFERING EXPERIENCES IN [LOC VENEZUELA  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Both [ORG GM  ] and [ORG GE  ] operate in [LOC Venezuela  ] and have had different experiences dealing with the [ORG GoV  ] . 
[ORG GM  ] has offices and factories located in [LOC Venezuela  ] , whereas [ORG GE  ] only ships products to the country and has little staff or facilities there . 
[ORG GM  ] President [PER Young  ] said [ORG GM  ] believes it is discriminated against in [LOC Venezuela  ] , resulting in a reducing market share compared to [MISC Japanese  ] auto makers . 
[LOC Venezuela  ] is still a profitable market for [ORG GM  ] , but if continued exhaustive perusal of documentation , imposition of further regulations , and other obstacles persist , doing business may become increasingly difficult . 
[ORG GE  ] , which has no manufacturing operations in [LOC Venezuela  ] , has experienced no problems . 
[ORG GE  ] is profitable in [LOC Venezuela  ] and plans to do more business there , particularly in the area of equipment used by the oil industry. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The Ambassador asked both [PER Young  ] and [PER Silva  ] about their companies' corporate responsibility programs and activities . 
[PER Young  ] stated [ORG GM  ] has several social responsibility programs , focusing on the local communities where [ORG GM  ] facilities are located , and promised to provide more detailed information . 
[PER Silva  ] said that of [ORG GE  ] 's 6,000 employees , 3,000 are active in social responsibility programs . 
Both executives were also enthusiastic about the possibility of creating a [MISC Brazilian  ] " [ORG Council on Competitiveness  ] " agenda , in addition to a speaker 's programs with local universities. ------------ [ORG AMCHAM  ] LUNCH ------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG AMCHAM Brazil  ] sponsored a lunch for the Ambassador , with approximately 50 members and private sector leaders in attendance . 
The [LOC Sao Paulo  ] [ORG AMCHAM  ] is the largest [ORG American Chamber of Commerce  ] in the world outside the [LOC United States  ] , bringing together over 6,000 small , medium , and large enterprises . 
There are affiliate offices in [LOC Belo Horizonte  ] , [LOC Brasilia  ] , [LOC Campinas  ] ( [LOC Sao Paulo  ] state ) , [LOC Curitiba  ] , [LOC Goiania  ] , [LOC Porto Alegre  ] and [LOC Recife  ] . 
80 percent of the members are [MISC Brazilian  ] companies , 13 percent are [MISC American  ] companies , and the rest are of other nationalities . 
The Ambassador delivered brief remarks on [ORG USG  ] 's interest in promoting investment and trade , and corporate responsibility . 
During the discussion period , some major issues of concern raised by the business leaders were the renewal of GSP benefits , the benefits to be derived from a closer bilateral trade relationship , cooperation on biofuels , the importance of the agricultural sector to [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Brazilian  ] commercial interests , concern over [LOC Venezuela  ] 's being part of [LOC Mercosul  ] , and prospects for the [LOC Doha Round  ] . 
The Ambassador stressed the important role that the [ORG AMCHAM  ] played in these issues. -------------------------- [ORG MOTION PICTURE ASSOCIATION  ] -------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ambassador later met with [PER Steve Solot  ] , Senior Vice President for [MISC Latin American  ] Operations for the [ORG Motion Picture Association  ] ( [ORG MPA  ] ) . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is the [MISC Latin American  ] region 's most important market , with 40 percent of regional media revenue , of which half is in video . 
The [ORG MPA  ] has a very good relationship with the [MISC Brazilian  ] film industry . 
Approximately 60 films were co-produced or co-distributed in the past two years , including the top five [MISC Brazilian  ] films for 2005 . 
[ORG MPA  ] continues to have major concerns about IPR piracy . 
In recognition of the [ORG GoB  ] 's growing [ORG SAO PAULO  ] 00000965 003 OF 003 efforts and accomplishments in combating piracy , [ORG MPA  ] plans to give an award to the head of the [ORG National Anti-Piracy Council  ] . 
Other issues of concern are: ( 1 ) the transition to digital TV and its effect on protection of content , ( 2 ) [LOC Brazil  ] 's Development [PER Agenda  ] in [ORG WIPO  ] , which seeks to provide more flexible copyright protection for developing countries ( the [ORG MPA  ] believes it should be the opposite ) , and ( 3 ) the [ORG USG  ] 's Special 301 process . 
[PER Solot  ] explained that the copyright industries advocated upgrading [LOC Brazil  ] on the [MISC Watch List  ] this year . 
[LOC Brazil  ] remained on the [MISC Priority Watch List  ] largely due to the [ORG GoB  ] 's policies on pharmaceutical patents ; nonetheless , most [MISC Brazilians  ] believe [ORG MPA  ] was responsible for the ranking due to its energetic advocacy for copyright protection . 
The Ambassador expressed interest in [PER Solot  ] 's offer to host film screenings , perhaps in coordination with Foreign Minister [PER Celso Amorim  ] , a former executive of [LOC Brazil  ] 's largest film company. ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) This was a successful visit that enabled the Ambassador to make further progress in the key areas of promoting trade and investment , underscoring the importance that the business community played in [MISC Brazilian  ] policy decisions . 
It also allowed the Ambassador to stress the importance of corporate responsibility . 
END COMMENT. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] has approved this cable .
