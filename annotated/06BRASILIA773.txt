( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary and [ORG Action Request  ] . 
In view of the President 's [ORG State of the Union  ] address calling for expanded [LOC U.S.  ] use of ethanol and [LOC Brazil  ] 's desire for closer ties to the [LOC United States  ] in this area , [ORG Mission  ] would like to stage a bilateral conference with [MISC Brazilian  ] government and industry on ethanol/biodiesel issues . 
Prior to moving forward , however , we need guidance from the interagency community on what approach we should pursue regarding biofuel cooperation with [LOC Brazil  ] . 
In addition , we welcome [LOC Washington  ] 's input on the topics that might be most effectively addressed in such an event . 
To cull the views of the various concerned agencies ( State , DOE , [ORG AID  ] , [ORG USTR  ] , [ORG USDA  ] , [ORG Commerce  ] , [ORG Treasury  ] , [ORG NSC  ] , etc . 
) , post suggests that a [MISC Sub-PCC  ] level meeting be called to expeditiously discuss the matter . 
End Summary and [ORG Action Request.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While [LOC Brazil  ] and the [ORG USG  ] are at odds on a number of high-profile issues ( [LOC FTAA  ] , [LOC WTO  ] , [ORG UNSC  ] expansion , among others ) , given increasing sentiment in the [LOC United States  ] in favor of renewable fuels and the [ORG GOB  ] 's oft-stated desire to intensify ethanol cooperation with the [LOC United States  ] , post believes that we should seek to transform this topic into a positive item on our bilateral agenda . 
As the world 's largest producer of ethanol , [LOC Brazil  ] has sought to reach out to the world 's second largest producer - the [LOC U.S.  ] President [PER Bush  ] 's [ORG State of the Union  ] address outlining new biofuel friendly energy policies received significant media coverage in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
In recent months in [LOC Brazil  ] , the President 's Office ( [LOC Planalto  ] ) , the [ORG Ministry of Mines and Energy  ] , the [ORG Ministry of Development  ] , Industry , and [ORG Commerce  ] , the [ORG Ministry of Agriculture  ] , the [ORG Ministry of External Relations  ] , and the [ORG Ministry of Science and Technology  ] have all raised ethanol issues in their meetings with [ORG USG  ] officials . 
Conversely , a host of congressional visitors ( [PER Codel Coleman  ] , [PER Codel Hyde  ] , [PER Codel McConnell  ] , [PER Codel Specter  ] , [PER Codel Grassley  ] , and [PER Nodel Dayton  ] ) have evinced interest in ensuring that the [LOC United States  ] learns from the [LOC Brazil  ] experience . 
State of [LOC Florida  ] and State of [LOC California  ] officials have voiced similar sentiments as well. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Similar to the various [ORG GOB  ] ministries involved in biofuels , ethanol is a topic that also cuts across [ORG USG  ] interagency lines . 
Inter alia , [ORG State , Commerce , Energy  ] , [ORG Treasury  ] , [ORG USTR  ] , [ORG USAID  ] , and [ORG Agriculture  ] all deal with it in one form or the other , whether it be from the development , trade , investment , research , environmental , or standards angle . 
Accordingly , to ensure that our approach is consistent with emerging [ORG USG  ] policies , we request that a [MISC Sub-PCC  ] meeting be convened to define the substance of our message and the approach ( most likely a conference ) to best move our agenda forward . 
The [ORG Department of Energy  ] has already expressed interest in such a conference. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Post welcomes guidance from [LOC Washington  ] .
