[ORG Begin Final Text of Suriname  ] , s country narrative in the 2009 TIP Report: -------------------------------- [LOC Suriname  ] ( [ORG TIER  ] 2 ) -------------------------------- [LOC Suriname  ] is a destination and transit country for men , women , and children from the [LOC Dominican Republic  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Guyana  ] , [LOC Colombia  ] , [LOC Haiti  ] , [LOC Indonesia  ] , [LOC Vietnam  ] , and [LOC China  ] trafficked for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor . 
[LOC Suriname  ] is also a source country for women and children trafficked within the country for sexual exploitation and forced labor , as well as women trafficked transnationally for forced labor . 
Foreign trafficking victims are exploited in illegal urban brothels and the western district of [LOC Nickerie  ] . 
[MISC Guyanese  ] women and girls are forced into street prostitution and are trafficked into the sex trade near both legal and illegal gold mining camps in the [LOC Amazon  ] jungle . 
At least one criminal network traffics [MISC Brazilian  ] women among gold mining sites in both [LOC Suriname  ] and [LOC French Guiana  ] . 
Women from urban areas are recruited for domestic work at these mining camps and subsequently coerced into sexual servitude . 
Some [MISC Chinese  ] men are subjected to forced labor in the construction industry , while some [MISC Chinese  ] women are forced into prostitution in massage parlors and brothels . 
[MISC Chinese  ] men and women are forced to labor in grocery stores . 
Some [MISC Haitian  ] migrants transiting [LOC Suriname  ] are forced to work in agriculture . 
Traffickers fraudulently promised at least 23 [MISC Surinamese  ] women that they would be given well-paying jobs in [LOC Europe  ] after finishing cooking school in [LOC Trinidad and Tobago  ] . 
The women were intercepted in [LOC Curacao  ] and returned to [LOC Suriname  ] . 
Although [MISC Chinese  ] organized crime units traffic some people to and through [LOC Suriname  ] , most traffickers in [LOC Suriname  ] operate through smaller , local networks . 
The Government of [LOC Suriname  ] does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking ; however , it is making significant efforts to do so . 
Despite significant resource constraints , the government increased anti-trafficking law enforcement actions , and modestly improved victim assistance and prevention efforts . 
Reports of officials , complicity in trafficking , however , continue and the government has made no efforts to reduce demand for commercial sex acts . 
Recommendations for [MISC Suriname: Continue  ] investigating , prosecuting , and adequately punishing trafficking offenders ; investigate and prosecute corrupt public officials who allegedly facilitate trafficking ; investigate reports of forced labor ; consider measures to better protect both foreign and [MISC Surinamese  ] trafficking victims ; and sponsor public campaigns to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts . 
Prosecution ----------- The [MISC Surinamese  ] government strongly increased its anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts over the last year . 
[LOC Suriname  ] prohibits all forms of human trafficking through a 2006 amendment to its Criminal Code , which prescribes sufficiently stringent penalties of five to 20 years , imprisonment ) penalties that are commensurate with those prescribed for other grave crimes . 
An interagency , public-private working group ( IWG ) coordinates government efforts to investigate and prosecute traffickers . 
The public prosecutor reported nine trafficking arrests between March 2008 and February 2009 . 
Three offenders were convicted: A [MISC Korean  ] boat captain was sentenced to six years , imprisonment for the forced labor of four [MISC Vietnamese  ] , and two nightclub owners , a [MISC Chinese  ] and [MISC Brazilian  ] couple , were convicted of trafficking nine [MISC Brazilian  ] women into prostitution . 
The husband was sentenced to 12 months' and the wife to four months' imprisonment . 
A case with three defendants accused of trafficking a 16-year old [MISC Guyanese  ] girl for sexual exploitation at a nightclub was before the courts in March <a id='par2009' href='#par2009'>¶</a>2009 . 
Two additional cases are pending . 
The TIP Police Unit regularly inspected places where trafficking victims might be found , and conducted random brothel checks to ensure the women were not mistreated , no minors were present , and that owners did not keep the women , s airline tickets and passports . 
The government requested the extradition of four Surinamers from [LOC Curacao  ] , in connection with the probable trafficking of 21 [MISC Surinamese  ] men and two women en route to [LOC Europe  ] through [LOC Trinidad and Tobago  ] ; three more Surinamers were arrested in [LOC Suriname  ] in connection with the case , and are in jail pending trial . 
Investigations continue in the case of 11 [MISC Indonesians  ] rescued from forced labor at a motorbike assembly plant . 
The government initiated investigations of some [MISC Surinamese  ] officials who reportedly facilitated trafficking into the country by accepting money and favors from suspected traffickers , though no prosecutions were begun . 
Protection ---------- The government continued to provide moderate protection for victims of trafficking during the year . 
The government provided free legal services to trafficking victims , and instituted a formal mechanism for referring victims to a local foundation which , in collaboration with the TIP Police Unit and the [ORG Ministry of Justice and Police  ] , coordinates the provision of shelter , medical care , and psychological services to identified foreign and [MISC Surinamese  ] victims . 
[MISC Surinamese  ] law does not grant foreign victims temporary or permanent residency status or legal alternatives to removal to countries where they may face hardship or retribution , though victims who participated in law enforcement investigations and prosecutions were allowed to stay during these proceedings . 
There were reports that some foreign victims were incarcerated and deported for immigration violations , though identified foreign victims are generally not penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked . 
The same local foundation is charged with arranging shelter and services for as long as victims are needed for the investigation and court case , then works with embassy or consulate officials to arrange victims , repatriation . 
Foreign victims were required to remain in the country until they could issue a sworn statement and a judge determined that they could leave [LOC Suriname  ] . 
Victims who had been found working illegally in [LOC Suriname  ] could not seek temporary employment while awaiting trial proceedings . 
The [ORG Ministry of Justice and Police  ] is reviewing draft legislation that would grant foreign victims legal resident status . 
The government encourages victims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking offenders . 
During the year , at least 28 victims cooperated with police . 
None chose to file a civil suit for restitution against their traffickers , although that option is available . 
Prevention ---------- The government continued its solid prevention efforts during the year . 
Senior officials continued to condemn and draw public attention to the problem of human trafficking in [LOC Suriname  ] . 
The government ran an education campaign for journalists , religious groups , youth organizations , officials , labor unions , brothel owners , and [ORG NGOs  ] , and conducted a specialized campaign in the [LOC Marowijne District  ] . 
The IWG systematically monitored government anti-trafficking efforts . 
Immigration police monitored visa applications and ports of entry for patterns that might indicate trafficking . 
Police closed a brothel in [LOC Nickerie  ] district for exploiting a minor in prostitution . 
The [ORG Ministry of Labor  ] along with the [ORG Youth Affairs  ] section of the Police Force and the [ORG Commission for Child Rights  ] educated and informed the public on the worst forms of child labor and child exploitation . 
The government made no discernable efforts to reduce demand for commercial sex acts. ---------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
Post may wish to deliver the following points , which offer technical and legal background on the TIP Report process , to the host government as a non-paper with the above TIP Report country narrative: ( begin non-paper ) -- The [ORG U.S. Congress  ] , through its passage of the 2000 [ORG Trafficking Victims Protection Act  ] , as amended ( [ORG TVPA  ] ) , requires the Secretary of State to submit an annual [MISC Report  ] to [ORG Congress  ] . 
The goal of this Report is to stimulate action and create partnerships around the world in the fight against modern-day slavery . 
The [ORG USG  ] approach to combating human trafficking follows the [ORG TVPA  ] and the standards set forth in the [ORG Protocol  ] to Prevent , [ORG Suppress  ] and [ORG Punish Trafficking  ] in [MISC Persons  ] , Especially Women and Children , supplementing the [ORG United Nations Convention  ] against [ORG Transnational Organized Crime  ] ( commonly known as the [ORG Palermo Protocol  ] ) . 
The [ORG TVPA  ] and the [ORG Palermo Protocol  ] recognize that this is a crime in which the victims , labor or services ( including in the sex industry ) are obtained or maintained through force , fraud , or coercion , whether overt or through psychological manipulation . 
While much attention has focused on international flows , both the [ORG TVPA  ] and the [ORG Palermo Protocol  ] focus on the exploitation of the victim , and do not require a showing that the victim was moved . 
-- Recent amendments to the [ORG TVPA  ] removed the requirement that only countries with a significant number of trafficking victims be included in the Report . 
Beginning with the 2009 TIP Report , countries determined to be a country of origin , transit , or destination for victims of severe forms of trafficking are included in the [MISC Report  ] and assigned to one of three tiers . 
Countries assessed as meeting the minimum standards for the elimination of severe forms of trafficking set forth in the [ORG TVPA  ] are classified as [ORG Tier  ] 1 . 
Countries assessed as not fully complying with the minimum standards , but making significant efforts to meet those minimum standards are classified as [ORG Tier  ] 2 . 
Countries assessed as neither complying with the minimum standards nor making significant efforts to do so are classified as [ORG Tier  ] 3 . 
-- The [ORG TVPA  ] also requires the Secretary of State to provide a [MISC Special Watch List  ] to [ORG Congress  ] later in the year . 
Anti-trafficking efforts of the countries on this list are to be evaluated again in an [ORG Interim Assessment  ] that the Secretary of State must provide to [ORG Congress  ] by February 1 of each year . 
Countries are included on the [MISC Special Watch List  ] if they move up in tier rankings in the annual TIP Report -- from 3 to 2 or from 2 to 1 ) or if they have been placed on the [ORG Tier  ] 2 [ORG Watch List  ] . 
-- [ORG Tier  ] 2 [ORG Watch List  ] consists of [ORG Tier  ] 2 countries determined: ( 1 ) not to have made increasing efforts to combat human trafficking over the past year ; ( 2 ) to be making significant efforts based on commitments of anti-trafficking reforms over the next year , or ( 3 ) to have a very significant number of trafficking victims or a significantly increasing victim population . 
As indicated in reftel B , the [ORG TVPRA  ] of 2008 contains a provision requiring that a country that has been included on [ORG Tier  ] 2 [ORG Watch List  ] for two consecutive years after the date of enactment of the [ORG TVPRA  ] of 2008 be ranked as [ORG Tier  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
Thus , any automatic downgrade to [ORG Tier  ] 3 pursuant to this provision would take place , at the earliest , in the 2011 TIP Report ( i.e. , a country would have to be ranked [ORG Tier  ] 2 [ORG Watch List  ] in the 2009 and 2010 Reports before being subject to [ORG Tier  ] 3 in the 2011 [MISC Report  ] ) . 
The new law allows for a waiver of this provision for up to two additional years upon a determination by the President that the country has developed and devoted sufficient resources to a written plan to make significant efforts to bring itself into compliance with the minimum standards . 
-- Countries classified as [ORG Tier  ] 3 may be subject to statutory restrictions for the subsequent fiscal year on non-humanitarian and non-trade-related foreign assistance and , in some circumstances , withholding of funding for participation by government officials or employees in educational and cultural exchange programs . 
In addition , the President could instruct the [LOC U.S.  ] executive directors to international financial institutions to oppose loans or other utilization of funds ( other than for humanitarian , trade-related or certain types of development assistance ) with respect to countries on [ORG Tier  ] 3 . 
Countries classified as [ORG Tier  ] 3 that take strong action within 90 days of the Report 's release to show significant efforts against trafficking in persons , and thereby warrant a reassessment of their [ORG Tier  ] classification , would avoid such sanctions . 
Guidelines for such actions are in the [MISC DOS-crafted  ] action plans to be shared by [ORG Posts  ] with host governments . 
-- The 2009 TIP Report , issuing as it does in the midst of the global financial crisis , highlights high levels of trafficking for forced labor in many parts of the world and systemic contributing factors to this phenomenon: fraudulent recruitment practices and excessive recruiting fees in workers , home countries ; the lack of adequate labor protections in both sending and receiving countries ; and the flawed design of some destination countries , sponsorship systems that do not give foreign workers adequate legal recourse when faced with conditions of forced labor . 
As the May 2009 ILO Global Report on Forced Labor concluded , forced labor victims suffer approximately $20 billion in losses , and traffickers , profits are estimated at $31 billion . 
The current global financial crisis threatens to increase the number of victims of forced labor and increase the associated cost of coercion . 
-- The text of the [ORG TVPA  ] and amendments can be found on website www.state.gov/g/tip . 
-- On June 16 , 2009 , the Secretary of State will release the ninth annual TIP Report in a public event at the [ORG State Department  ] . 
We are providing you an advance copy of your country 's narrative in that report . 
Please keep this information embargoed until 10:00 am [LOC Washington DC  ] time June <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 .

The following is press guidance provided for Post to use with local media . 
Q1 . 
Why is [LOC Suriname  ] again given a ranking of [ORG Tier  ] 2 ? <a id='parA' href='#parA'>¶</a>A . 
The Government of [LOC Suriname  ] does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking ; however , it is making significant efforts to do so . 
Despite its considerable resource constraints , the government increased anti-trafficking law enforcement actions , and modestly improved victim assistance and prevention efforts in the past year . 
Reports of officials , complicity in trafficking , however , continue and the government has made no efforts to reduce demand for commercial sex acts . 
Q2 . 
What is the nature of the trafficking situation in [LOC Suriname  ] ? <a id='parA' href='#parA'>¶</a>A . 
[LOC Suriname  ] is a destination and transit country for men , women , and children from [LOC South America  ] , the [LOC Caribbean  ] , and [LOC Asia  ] trafficked for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor . 
[LOC Suriname  ] is also a source country for women and children trafficked within the country for sexual exploitation and forced labor , and has recently become a source for women trafficked transnationally , presumably for forced labor . 
Foreign trafficking victims are exploited in illegal urban brothels and the western district of [LOC Nickerie  ] . 
[MISC Guyanese  ] women and girls are forced into street prostitution and are trafficked into the sex trade near both legal and illegal gold mining camps in the [LOC Amazon  ] jungle . 
At least one criminal network traffics [MISC Brazilian  ] women among gold mining sites in both [LOC Suriname  ] and [LOC French Guiana  ] . 
Women from urban areas are recruited for domestic work at these mining camps and subsequently coerced into sexual servitude . 
Some [MISC Chinese  ] men are subjected to forced labor in the construction industry , while some [MISC Chinese  ] women are forced into prostitution in massage parlors and brothels . 
[MISC Chinese  ] men and women are forced to labor in grocery stores . 
Some [MISC Haitian  ] migrants transiting [LOC Suriname  ] are forced to work in agriculture . 
Traffickers fraudulently promised at least 23 [MISC Surinamese  ] women that they would be given well-paying jobs in [LOC Europe  ] after finishing cooking school in [LOC Trinidad and Tobago  ] . 
The women were intercepted in [LOC Curacao  ] and returned to [LOC Suriname  ] . 
Although [MISC Chinese  ] organized crime units traffic some people to and through [LOC Suriname  ] , most traffickers in [LOC Suriname  ] operate through smaller , local networks . 
Q3 . 
How can [LOC Suriname  ] show further progress in its anti-trafficking efforts ? <a id='parA' href='#parA'>¶</a>A . 
To advance its efforts to combat trafficking , the government could continue investigating , prosecuting , and adequately punishing trafficking offenders ; investigate and prosecute corrupt public officials who allegedly facilitate trafficking ; investigate reports of forced labor ; consider measures to better protect both foreign and [MISC Surinamese  ] trafficking victims ; and sponsor public campaigns to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 .
