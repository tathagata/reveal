( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Summary:  ] The leaders of the [ORG PSC  ] , [ORG ERC  ] , and the [ORG Initiative  ] for [ORG Catalonia Greens  ] ( [ORG ICV  ] ) , the three-party coalition ( [ORG Tripartite  ] ) , which has governed [LOC Catalonia  ] since 2003 , agreed in principal November 4 to reprise their oft-fractious partnership and form the next autonomous regional government . 
[ORG ERC  ] leader [PER Josep  ] [ORG Carod Rovira  ] announced the agreement after a two-day round of marathon talks . 
[ORG PSC  ] presidential candidate [PER Jose Montilla  ] will be named President - the first non-Catalan born president in the region 's history . 
[PER Carod  ] will encumber the newly created position of Vice President ( formerly First Counselor ) . 
Reaction from the [ORG CiU  ] was swift: presidential candidate [PER Artur Mas  ] accused [PER Montilla  ] and [PER Carod  ] of " tricking " the voters . 
[ORG CiU Secgen  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG Parliament  ] member [PER Josep Antoni Duran  ] Lleida immediately announced his party would pull its support from PM [PER Zapatero  ] , both have since moderated their early remarks . 
Playing to his strength as stable and serious , [PER Montilla  ] will have to move quickly to allay fears that he is not focused enough on [MISC Catalan  ] interests , even as he works to implement the [MISC Catalan  ] autonomy statute ( [LOC Estatut  ] ) . 
Otherwise , he could find himself facing the same problems his predecessor faced with an outspoken coalition partner that focuses more narrowly on [MISC Catalan  ] independence rather than broader social and economic issues . 
End Summary . 
PSC-ERC-ICV Tripartite: Round Two <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Republican  ] Left of [MISC Catalan  ] ( [ORG ERC  ] ) President [PER Josep Lluis  ] [PER Carod Rovira  ] announced November 4 that the three parties that made up the previous governing coalition in [LOC Catalonia  ] - the so-called [ORG Tripartite  ] - had reached agreement to reform the alliance , thus , denying [PER Artur Mas  ] and the [ORG Convergence and Union  ] ( [ORG CiU  ] ) the chance to form the government . 
( [MISC Note:  ] The [ORG CiU  ] coalition won the November 1 elections , but did not win an outright majority ( reftel ) . 
End note . 
) [ORG Socialist Party of Catalan  ] ( [ORG PSC  ] ) presidential candidate [PER Jose Montilla  ] will be elected President of the autonomous region ( [MISC Generalitat  ] ) ; [PER Carod  ] will occupy the newly created position of Vice President , and [ORG Initiative  ] for [ORG Catalonia Greens  ] ( [ORG ICV  ] ) President [PER Joan Saur  ] will likely occupy the third most important position as Counselor for the [ORG Interior and Institutional Relations and Participation  ] . 
The three parties will have a total of 70 seats in the [ORG Parliament  ] ; two seats more than necessary to control [ORG Parliament  ] . 
[PER Montilla  ] 's investiture will be an historic occasion as he will become the first non-Catalan born president in the region 's history , a subject that ran as an undercurrent throughout the election . 
In remarks November 7 , [PER Montilla  ] presented his new team to the press November 7 , and in his statement he declared , " I am aware that all was not positive during the last legislature , but in life what is important is not to not commit mistakes , but to learn from your mistakes~we will not repeat the mistakes of the past . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) In this vein , the coalition reportedly has agreed to the following broad guidelines: No surprises - [PER Carod  ] and [PER Saura  ] have apparently agreed to inform [PER Montilla  ] before taking any actions that might adversely affect the [MISC Generalitat  ] . 
Unity first - The three leaders have agreed to put the interests of the autonomous region before party interests . 
All for [LOC Catalonia  ] - Social issues , including housing , education , and employment , will be the focus of the [MISC Generalitat  ] . 
Sharp [PER CiU  ] Reaction <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The reaction from [ORG CiU  ] presidential candidate [PER Artur Mas  ] , and [PER CiU Secgen  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] Parliamentarian [PER Jose Antoni Duran  ] , was swift and angry . 
[PER Mas  ] accused [PER Montilla  ] and [PER Carod  ] of " tricking " the voters into believing another [ORG Tripartite  ] was not an option . 
[PER Duran  ] announced his party would not continue to support the government of PM [PER Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero  ] . 
Both later moderated their initial remarks as foreshadowed to the CG by [PER Joan Russell  ] , [ORG Popular Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) insider and President of the [ORG Catalan Manufacturers Association  ] . 
[ORG Catalans Calm  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Catalans  ] have reacted calmly to the news of the [ORG Tripartite  ] resurgence . 
Polls leading up to November 1 indicated that this might be a possible outcome of the election . 
What might have taken some by surprise was the speed with which the coalition came together to form their government . 
Media reported some small , but noisy protests in and around [ORG Barcelona  ] , but no other activity of note . 
It appears [ORG Catalans  ] are either resigned , or simply willing to give [PER Montilla  ] and his new team a chance . 
[ORG BARCELONA  ] 00000169 002.2 OF 002 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: Once confirmed in [ORG Parliament  ] , [PER Montilla  ] will have to quickly show his government is ready for work as his grace period will likely be short , and an angry [ORG CiU  ] will be nipping at his shoes from the start . 
A first order of business is likely to be quick implementation of the [LOC Estatut  ] , and even this will take the measure of [PER Montilla  ] 's ability . 
It was the [ORG ERC  ] that refused to vote in favor of the [LOC Estatut  ] , which resulted in its expulsion from the coalition over the summer and the call for early elections . 
[PER Montilla  ] will also have to allay [ORG ERC  ] ( for a start ) fears that he might be soft on [MISC Catalan  ] interests , an issue the [ORG CiU  ] ( at a minimum ) will want to use against him during his mandate . 
At the national level , the coalition is already paying dividends: according to press reports , the [ORG ERC  ] quickly supported the [ORG PSOE  ] in the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG Parliament  ] on several budgetary issues after [ORG CiU  ] parliamentarians withdrew their support .
