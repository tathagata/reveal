Reason: 1.4 ( B ) ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: Over rubbery fish at an [MISC Adenauer Stiftung  ] affair on April 27 , External Relations Commissioner [PER Chris Patten  ] touched briefly on why the [ORG EU  ] will never be a “real power , ” the dubious backgrounds of some of the leaders of the EU’s new members , next steps on Cyprus/Turkey , the differences between a union and an alliance , and [MISC Russian  ] President Putin’s “killer’s eyes.” His formal remarks focused on the future of the [ORG European Commission  ] , where he offered ten recommendations to the next commission . 
End Summary . 
On What It Means to Be a “Real [MISC Power”  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) To be a real power , [PER Patten  ] said , a country must be ready and able to adopt and implement a policy , even if the rest of the world considers it unwise . 
[MISC Europeans  ] may agree or disagree with [LOC US  ] policy , but they admire that the [LOC US  ] is ready to carry out the policies it thinks best , no matter what the rest of the world thinks . 
Under this yardstick , the [ORG EU  ] will never be a “real power” because there is always someone in the room who is overly cautious , and will insist on looking at matters “sensibly.” Next Steps On [MISC Cyprus/Papadopolous’ Dubious Character...  ] --------------------------------------------- ---------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The next steps for the [ORG Commission  ] are figuring out how to spend money in [LOC Northern Cyprus  ] . 
[PER Patten  ] expects the [ORG EC  ] to open an office to oversee their assistance . 
While there will be legal hurdles to managing the process , he was confident the [ORG Commission  ] would find a way . 
[PER Patten  ] doubted the [MISC Greek  ] [ORG Cypriots  ] would openly oppose any efforts , noting that they were “on their heels” diplomatically after their blatant efforts to stifle opposing views on the referendum . 
This incident , [PER Patten  ] said , was a sad reflection on the realities of [ORG EU  ] enlargement: Some of the new members were people you would “only want to dine with if you have a very long spoon.” Not that the [ORG EU  ] should have been surprised by [MISC Papadopolous’  ] behavior , [PER Patten  ] said , since they knew well who they were dealing with: Milosevic’s lawyer.XXXXXXXXXXXX .. . 
And on [LOC Turkey  ] ----------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Patten  ] noted that he was the biggest proponent in the [ORG Commission  ] for [ORG Turkey’s  ] admission . 
In his view , based on the technical merits alone , the [ORG Commission  ] has no other option but to give a positive avis to begin accession negotiations . 
Still , he said the political climate in [LOC Europe  ] is not receptive to [ORG Turkey’s  ] candidacy . 
The problem , in his view , was not [PER Chirac  ] in [LOC France  ] , since “he can change his policies on a whim.” [PER Patten  ] considered the opposition of conservative parties in [LOC Germany  ] and [LOC Spain  ] the most serious obstacles to [MISC Turkish  ] admission . 
On the Difference Between a [ORG Union  ] and an Alliance --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Patten  ] also said he felt at times the [LOC US  ] does not fully appreciate the difference between expanding an alliance like [ORG NATO  ] , and a [ORG Union  ] like the [ORG EU  ] . 
When a country joins an alliance , it becomes a distinct member of a group committed to a common cause -- but nothing more . 
When countries join the [ORG EU  ] , they become part of the whole , formally and practically indistinct in many areas of [ORG EU  ] competence. “We have to be ready to trust their food and sanitation standards , for instance.” In this regard , he noted that some of the accession countries were foisted on the [ORG EU  ] as part of a larger bargain . 
[LOC Cyprus  ] , for instance , probably should not have been admitted ( as Papadapolous’ behavior prior to the referendum indicated ) , but the [MISC Greeks  ] insisted on [MISC Cypriot  ] admission as the price of agreeing to some of the northern [MISC European  ] candidates . 
[LOC Croatia  ] , [PER Patten  ] said , is probably far more prepared for [ORG EU  ] membership than either [LOC Bulgaria  ] or [LOC Romania  ] , who will likely enter the [ORG Union  ] earlier . 
[LOC Romania  ] , in particular , was a “feral nation.” We noted that we were shocked by del [PER Ponte’s  ] clean bill of health on [ORG ICTY  ] cooperation while [PER Gotovina  ] still was at large inside [LOC Croatia  ] . 
[PER Patten  ] said he too was surprised by del [PER Ponte’s  ] letter , but once the referee had made the call , the [ORG EU  ] was bound by her judgement . 
On [LOC Russia  ] , [ORG WTO  ] , [ORG Kyoto  ] , and Putin’s “Killer’s Eyes” --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Patten  ] was in [LOC Moscow  ] last week , and had just concluded [MISC EU-Russia  ] ministerial consultations in [LOC Brussels  ] this week . 
He said the [ORG EU  ] had become overly dependent on [MISC Russian  ] energy supplies , and should become more engaged with the countries of the [MISC Caucasus  ] and [LOC Central Asia  ] in order to diversify supplies . 
To do so , however , the [ORG Union  ] would also have to become more involved in pipeline politics. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG WTO  ] discussions had not moved forward substantially during these most recent talks . 
[PER Patten  ] said the [ORG EC  ] was sticking with its positions on energy , but he was worried that they may have taken too strong a line , and would be forced to backpedal significantly at a later stage . 
In his view , this was unfortunate because he was worried the [ORG EC  ] was spending too much negotiating effort on energy rather than focussing on other items that really mattered , such as overflights . 
[PER Patten  ] also said that [PER Putin  ] had explicitly suggested a possible trade-off between the [MISC Russian  ] position on the [ORG Kyoto Protocol  ] and [ORG WTO  ] negotiations during last week’s talks , although he was not sure how serious the [MISC Russians  ] were on this , or whether it was a convincing trade-off for [ORG Commission  ] officials. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Patten  ] said [PER Putin  ] has done a good job for [LOC Russia  ] mainly due to high world energy prices , but he had serious doubts about the man’s character . 
Cautioning that “I’m not saying that genes are determinant , ” [PER Patten  ] then reviewed [PER Putin  ] family history: grandfather part of [LOC Lenin’s  ] special protection team , father a communist party apparatchik , and [PER Putin  ] himself decided at a young age to pursue a career in the [LOC KGB.  ] “He seems a completely reasonable man when discussing the [LOC Middle East  ] or energy policy , but when the conversation shifts to [LOC Chechnya  ] or [MISC Islamic  ] extremism , Putin’s eyes turn to those of a killer.” Ten Commandments for the Next [ORG Commission  ] ---------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Patten’s public remarks at the dinner focused on the future of the [ORG Commission  ] -- not foreign affairs . 
He offered ten recommendations for the next [ORG Commission  ] to help them improve the EU’s image with [LOC Europe’s  ] citizenry , as follows: -- 1 ) Deliver substance: highlight areas where the [ORG EU  ] can make a difference in the world , such as the rapid changes in Justice and [ORG Home Affairs  ] , or external assistance. -- 2 ) Go with the flow of the institutional debate: Don’t spend energy trying to stop intergovernmental efforts that have a head of steam behind them . 
Instead , try to channel these efforts in useful directions. -- 3 ) Exploit the “Community Method” where it exists: Make the most of [ORG EC  ] strengths , such as on the internal market , trade , or foreign assistance. -- 4 ) Be open to new ways of working: The number of regulations passed should not be a measure of success of the [ORG Commission.  ] -- 5 ) Regulate better: aggesively develop the initiative the [ORG Commission  ] launched in 2002 . 
Get serious about consultation and impact assessment rather than just going through the motions. --6 ) Get economic management right: There should be no “free riders” in the monetary union , but the [ORG EU  ] should seek greater flexibility that takes account of the differences between states . 
The [ORG Commission  ] must also be ready to accept the same sort of management discipline it demands of the [LOC Member States.  ] -- 7 ) Put more effort into monitoring implementation of [ORG EU  ] legislation: use score cards and “league tables” on infractions . 
Compare best practices . 
Be ready to be tougher on sanctioning persistent bad performance , perhaps by cutting [ORG EU  ] financial programs such as structural funds. -- 8 ) Be prepared to scale back or eliminate bad policies: Take a thorough look at the [ORG CAP  ] , and focus greater attention on what needs to be done at the Community level , and where “subsidiarity” and national/local administrations would be the better option. -- 9 ) Get internal organization right: Create real clusters of issues where [ORG Commission  ] Vice Presidents have real authority. -- 10 ) Demonstrate that the [ORG EU  ] can make a difference to people’s lives .
