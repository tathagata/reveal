( [ORG SBU  ] ) One demonstration drew 30-40 protesters . 
Approximately 400 demonstrators participated in the second demonstration. iv . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The two anti-American protests in this SEPQ period occurred in December 2008 and January 2009 .

( [ORG SBU  ] ) There has been a dramatic increase in demonstrations against the [MISC Icelandic  ] government since [ORG Post  ] 's last SEPQ response . 
The primary cause is the current domestic economic crisis . 
Demonstrations have also been organized to protest military action , environmental issues , salary/benefit disputes , soaring gas prices , and a [ORG NATO  ] conference. i .

( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Host Country Capabilities <a id='parA' href='#parA'>¶</a>A . 
( C ) The police ( [ORG Logreglan  ] ) are well-trained and professional . 
All police attend the national police academy with a comprehensive curriculum . 
The current number of police officers in [LOC Iceland  ] is 780 ( 1 police officer for every 409 citizens ) . 
A newspaper article on 12 February 2009 claims the [ORG Metropolitan Police  ] ( [LOC Reykjavik  ] ) is in dire financial straits . 
Costs relating to the demonstrations are piling up with no funds to cover them in the budget . 
The Police Commissioner is fearful that police officer positions will be cut to offset those expenses . 
Such a cut will be detrimental to a police force that has only 20-25 officers on patrol during any shift. <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Icelandic  ] police have been trained by [LOC US  ] agencies in various areas including customs/border/port security , cyber security and computer crimes , hostage negotiation , crisis management , and several others . 
The training has been effective . 
The [ORG RSO  ] notes evidence of the training in his interactions with the police . 
There has been no training since [ORG Post  ] , s last SEPQ response. <a id='parC' href='#parC'>¶</a>C . 
( C ) No evidence of corruption has been observed or uncovered. <a id='parD' href='#parD'>¶</a>D . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [LOC Iceland  ] does not have an intelligence service . 
The [ORG National Security Unit  ] ( [ORG NSU  ] ) within the National Commissioner 's Office handles threat information analysis . 
The [ORG NSU  ] is comprised of three individuals . 
The [ORG NSU  ] is too small to undertake any type of intelligence gathering role and responds to threats as they arise , such as threats against [MISC Icelandic  ] officials , demonstrations/protests , and " extremist " groups . 
The [ORG NSU  ] is not a tradecraft or covert group . 
There are no terrorism-related examples , but the [ORG NSU  ] 's investigative and analytical capabilities have been demonstrated through operations in varying fields of law enforcement such as organized crime ( [ORG OC  ] ) , counterintelligence ( [ORG CI  ] ) , and counter-narcotics ( [ORG CN  ] ) . 
GRPO maintains liaison with the [LOC NSU.  ] <a id='parE' href='#parE'>¶</a>E . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Law enforcement agencies , including the [ORG NSU  ] , have been very cooperative with [ORG US Embassy  ] requests for information and support. <a id='parF' href='#parF'>¶</a>F . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG N/A  ] <a id='parG' href='#parG'>¶</a>G . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) All planned requests for support were fully completed in a timely and thorough manner . 
All impromptu requests for support were responded to within minutes. <a id='parH' href='#parH'>¶</a>H . 
( C ) The overall assessment of security at the major airport in [LOC Iceland  ] is excellent . 
Screening is comparable to [LOC US  ] standards and perimeter security is well-organized and implemented . 
There are direct flights into and out of the [LOC US  ] . 
The [ORG Transportation and Security Administration  ] ( [ORG TSA  ] ) is closely involved with the security requirements/standards at [ORG Keflavik International Airport  ] ( [ORG KEF  ] ) . 
The [ORG Keflavik Airport Authority  ] changed hands on 1 January 2009 . 
Security responsibilities are now handled by a private limited company owned by the government . 
The current Director of Security was the [ORG Acting Airport Managing  ] Director prior to the change. <a id='parI' href='#parI'>¶</a>I . 
( C ) The customs and immigration controls at [ORG KEF  ] are effective . 
The [ORG Sudurnes Police District  ] , the district responsible for the airport , has a high success rate of intercepting contraband and suspect travel documents . 
The police monitor passenger manifests prior to aircraft arrival ( [ORG Advanced Passenger Information  ] - [ORG API  ] ) and compare the list against several databases , including [ORG Interpol  ] and [ORG Europol  ] . 
The police possess a fraudulent document lab at the airport that deals with the fraudulent travel documents . 
Although the numbers of events and personnel are relatively low , their effectiveness is high . 
As of 1 January 2009 , the customs authority now falls under the [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] but is currently still operationally-controlled by the [ORG Sudurnes Police  ] Commissioner . 
This change-over is a work in progress . 
Eventually the Commissioner will have no responsibility or oversight of Customs at [LOC Keflavik.  ] <a id='parJ' href='#parJ'>¶</a>J . 
( C ) Border patrol forces are effective . 
Police and customs interdict narcotics on a somewhat regular basis . 
The police do recognize the possibility that their borders could be infiltrated by rogue individuals using small seacraft and thus rely upon the [ORG Icelandic Coast Guard  ] ( [ORG ICG  ] ) for patrolling the waters . 
The [ORG ICG  ] has made severe cuts to their personnel and have limited their activities to rescue operations and training necessary to maintain proficiency operating their helicopters , aircraft and vessels. -------------------- [ORG INDIGENOUS TERRORISM  ] -------------------- <a id='parI' href='#parI'>¶</a>I .
