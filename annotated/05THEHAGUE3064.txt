THE HAGUE 03008 Classified By: CHARGE CHAT BLAKEMAN FOR REASONS 1.5 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [MISC SUMMARY:  ] The [MISC Dutch  ] are concerned that riots similar to those in [LOC France  ] are unlikely , but could erupt in the [LOC Netherlands  ] given a dramatic trigger event , especially between police and [MISC Muslim  ] youth . 
Embassy contacts emphasized that differences between the [MISC French  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] immigrant communities and social policies make such unrest relatively unlikely absent provocation . 
National and local governments are taking measures to reduce the likelihood of [MISC French-style  ] riots and to end them quickly should they occur . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The rioting in [LOC France  ] has forced [MISC Dutch  ] politicians , community leaders , and average citizens to take a hard look at their own society . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] media has presented an extensive debate as to whether such unrest could occur in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
Local government officials , police , academics and [MISC Muslim  ] community leaders generally downplay the likelihood of violent protests and stress the difference between the [MISC French  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] situations. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [MISC Dutch  ] consider the following as major differences between the two countries: there is more contact in the [LOC Netherlands  ] between white [MISC Dutch  ] and immigrants ; immigrant housing conditions in [LOC Holland  ] tend to be better and less ghettoized ; and the [MISC Dutch  ] police are perceived to be more community-minded and less heavy-handed with immigrants . 
One [MISC Dutch-Moroccan  ] youth leader , [PER Ahmed Dadou  ] , who lived in [LOC Paris  ] for one year told emboff , Life may be bad for [MISC Muslim  ] youth in [LOC Amsterdam  ] , but the situation is nothing like the suburbs of [LOC Paris  ] . 
Even kids who live in segregated , so-called bad neighborhoods here have encounters with the rest of society through school or shopping or being on the street. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [MISC Dutch  ] police contacts informed RSO on November 7 that police intelligence units have no indications that youths are planning disturbances in any major [MISC Dutch  ] city , including [LOC Amsterdam  ] , [LOC Rotterdam  ] , [LOC Utrecht  ] and The [PER Hague  ] , all considered possible flash points because of their sizable [MISC Muslim  ] populations . 
The Mayor of [LOC Rotterdam  ] told Charge on November 7 , for example , that he was confident that [LOC Rotterdam  ] will remain calm , despite the widely publicized resignation of a right-wing council member this week for making anti-Muslim remarks . 
As a precaution , the police have increased their presence in minority neighborhoods in large cities and have promised a quick response should violence erupt . 
Police have also increased dialogue with community groups and are aware that the [MISC Muslim  ] community may be very sensitive to police actions perceived to be against [MISC Islam  ] . 
The [MISC Neighborhood Fathers  ] , a watch group in [LOC Amsterdam  ] , for example has increased its cooperation with local police and guaranteed that no riots would happen in [LOC Amsterdam  ] . 
[LOC Amsterdam  ] is paradise compared to [LOC Paris  ] , one member of the group told police during a recent neighborhood meeting . 
Professor [PER Meindert Fennema  ] at [ORG University of Amsterdam  ] said on November 8 that , although notorious troublemakers could be provoked to follow the [MISC French  ] example and set cars on fire , major riots are unlikely. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Nearly all of our contacts acknowledged that violent unrest in the [LOC Netherlands  ] , while unlikely , was a distinct possibility . 
Violent clashes did break out between immigrant youth and police in [LOC Amsterdam  ] in 1998 , and although there were not actual riots after the murder of [PER Pim Fortuyn  ] and [PER Theo van Gogh  ] , van [PER Gogh  ] 's murder did bring some civil unrest in the form of attacks against mosques and churches throughout the country . 
During a meeting November 7 , [PER Jean Tillie  ] , a sociologist from the [ORG University of Amsterdam  ] , told emboffs that ten years ago he would have said absolutely no riots would occur here ; now he is not so sure . 
The climate has changed in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
Youths are more disillusioned and radicalized that we thought. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Mohammed Assa  ] of the [ORG Street Corner Foundation  ] in [ORG Eastern Amsterdam  ] told emboff November 7 that he would not rule out [MISC French-style  ] riots: Everyone talks about the riots and many sympathize with what is happening in [LOC Paris  ] . 
Chatrooms catering to immigrant youth have been filled with discussions of the [MISC French  ] riots and comparisons -- many negative -- with the situation of [MISC Muslim  ] youths in [LOC Holland  ] . 
[PER Dadou  ] noted that the [MISC French  ] government has so far been careful not to emphasize the role of religion among the rioters ; if this were to change , he added , [MISC Dutch Muslim  ] youth might feel increased solidarity with their [MISC French  ] counterparts and could be more inclined to take to the streets in sympathy. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Moustapha Baba  ] , a prominent [MISC Dutch-Moroccan  ] businessman and community leader in [LOC Amsterdam  ] , told emboff November 9 that feelings are tense in the [LOC Netherlands  ] and riots could result if there were a trigger event . 
If the police threw a grenade into a mosque , I think youngsters would explode , said [PER Abdel Bouali  ] a youth worker in the [LOC Amsterdam Neighborhood of Osdorp  ] . 
Such trigger events are difficult to predict . 
In 1998 , for example , long-standing tensions between [MISC Moroccan  ] youth and police erupted into violence after a relatively minor altercation between a policeman and a [MISC Moroccan  ] boy and his father . 
Noting that riots were always possible , [LOC Amsterdam West  ] police youth coordinator [PER Ton Smakman  ] told emboff November 8 his greatest fear was that , One stupid guy may see on television what is going on in [LOC France  ] and decide to do something like that here . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) In the past year , the [ORG GONL  ] has twice braced for riots that did not occur: once after the murder of [PER Theo van Gogh  ] in November 2004 , and once after a white [MISC Dutch  ] woman ran over and killed a [MISC Moroccan  ] youth attempting to steal her purse in January 2005 . 
In both instances , community leaders and government officials combined calls for restraint with quick action to identify and punish perpetrators of racist violence on both sides . 
Behind the quick responses , however , was a palpable fear that such incidents could easily spin out of control -- and that [MISC Dutch  ] society is ill-prepared to deal with serious unrest among its large and disaffected immigrant youth population . 
This realization is fueling a growing debate in the media and political circles here on what can be done to make [MISC French-style  ] riots not only unlikely , but unthinkable . 
END COMMENT .
