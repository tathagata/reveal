[LOC MINSK  ] 465 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Karen Stewart  ] for reason 1.4 ( d ) Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) As predicted , President [PER Lukashenko  ] replaced [MISC Belarusian  ] KGB ( [ORG BKGB  ] ) Chief [PER Sukharenko  ] with [ORG Major General Zhadobin  ] , the former head of the presidential security service . 
[PER Lukashenko  ] also removed [PER Sukharenko  ] 's deputy [PER Dementei  ] , but no replacement has been made . 
Official statements claim the dismissals were a result of [PER Sukharenko  ] 's and [PER Dementei  ] 's " transfer to other posts , " but embassy contacts and opposition activists attribute the dismissals to [PER Sukharenko  ] 's power struggle with Interior Minister [PER Naumov  ] and corruption within the [ORG BKGB  ] . 
[PER Zhadobin  ] , a close associate of [PER Lukashenko  ] and his son [PER Viktor  ] , has already been tasked with making staff changes within the [ORG BKGB  ] and [ORG State Security Committee  ] , which we expect is a move to put all law-enforcement agencies and security services under [PER Lukashenko  ] 's and [PER Viktor  ] 's firm control . 
End summary . 
Do Not Let The [MISC Door Hit You On The Way  ] Out ------------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The presidential press department announced on July 17 that President [PER Aleksandr Lukashenko  ] relieved [MISC Belarusian  ] KGB ( [ORG BKGB  ] ) Chief [PER Stepan Sukharenko  ] and replaced him with [ORG Major General Yuriy Zhadobin  ] , the former chief of the presidential security service . 
Former head of the presidential bodyguard service [PER Andrey Vtyurin  ] replaced [PER Zhadobin  ] . 
The outgoing [PER Sukharenko  ] , born in a village near [LOC Svetlagorsk  ] ( [LOC Gomel  ] oblast ) in 1957 , had served as [ORG BKGB  ] chief since January 2005 . 
Deputy Head of the [ORG BKGB  ] [PER Vasiliy Dementei  ] was also removed from his position . 
The press department gave few details of [PER Sukharenko  ] 's and [PER Dementei  ] 's removal , other than it was due to the former [MISC Chekists'  ] " transfer to another post . 
" According to the presidential office , [PER Lukashenko  ] tasked [PER Zhadobin  ] to submit proposals on strengthening the staff within the [ORG BKGB  ] . 
Meet The [MISC New Boss  ] , Same As The [MISC Old Boss  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Zhadobin  ] , born in [LOC Dnipropetrovsk  ] , [LOC Ukraine  ] in 1954 , began his career in 1972 after joining the [ORG USSR Armed Forces  ] . 
He graduated from the [ORG Kazan Higher Tank Command School  ] in 1976 and finished the [ORG Armored Forces Academy  ] , command department , in [LOC Moscow  ] in 1985 . 
In 1990-99 , [PER Zhadobin  ] served with the [ORG Belarusian Civil Defense  ] organization and Interior Troops . 
In 1999 he was appointed deputy minister of internal affairs and Interior Troops commander. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) According to human rights [PER NGO Charter97  ] , [PER Zhadobin  ] - just like [PER Sukharenko  ] before him -- used to provide " evidence " to support [PER Lukashenko  ] 's paranoid theories that enemies ( particularly the [LOC West  ] ) were out to destroy him . 
During a September 2004 meeting with his [ORG Security Council  ] , [PER Lukashenko  ] condemned the [LOC West  ] 's visa ban on senior [ORG GOB  ] officials and lambasted the opposition 's attempts to destabilize the country , noting " material " provided by [PER Zhadobin  ] that warned of enemy preparations to commit aggressive acts against the [ORG GOB  ] leadership , including liquidation of the president . 
[PER Sukharenko  ] 's Removal Serves Whose Interests ? -------------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Human rights lawyer and former investigator [PER Oleg  ] xxxxxxxxxxxxx on July 17 opined to reporters that the [ORG BKGB  ] Chief 's removal resulted from a power struggle between [PER Sukharenko  ] and Interior Minister [PER Vladimir Naumov  ] ( ref A ) . 
According to xxxxxxxxxxxxx , [PER Sukharenko  ] was very close [ORG toSecurity Council  ] Head [PER Viktor Sheyman  ] , leader of one of the power clans in [PER Lukashenko  ] 's circle . 
However , [PER Sheyman  ] would likely become the ambassador to [LOC Venezuela  ] , leaving [PER Sukharenko  ] defenseless against other clans , such as [PER Naumov  ] or even [PER Lukashenko  ] 's son [PER Viktor  ] , who is a presidential aide , advisor on national and presidential security , and member of the [ORG Security Council  ] . 
Therefore , it was " obvious , " according to xxxxxxxxxxxxx , that the new head of the [ORG BKGB  ] would be a trusted colleague of [MISC Viktor.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In a July 16 meeting , xxxxxxxxxxxxx told Poloff that should [PER Sukharenko  ] be removed , [PER Viktor Lukashenko  ] would fill the position with a buddy and much of the [ORG BKGB  ] staff with trusted friends and colleagues to bring the [ORG BKGB  ] under his full control . 
According to xxxxxxxxxxxxx , the administration was already threatening to deny senior [ORG BKGB  ] agents pensions , even those not near retirement age , if they did not retire by the end of the year . 
In his July 17 interview with reporters , xxxxxxxxxxxxx claimed that the new [ORG BKGB  ] leadership would cause a change in the agency 's powers , as the president wants to be sure that the [ORG BKGB  ] and all law-enforcement agencies are under his and [PER Viktor  ] 's control before 2011 presidential elections . 
According to xxxxxxxxxxxxx , [PER Zhadobin  ] was " very close " to the president and his son . 
He predicted [PER Sukharenko  ] would become an ambassador in an [MISC Asian  ] country , a previous form of political exile for several former power clan leaders and close associates of [LOC Lukashenko.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) According to [ORG United Civic Party  ] leader [PER Anatoliy Lebedko  ] 's July 17 interview with reporters , [PER Sukharenko  ] 's removal was the result of a business war among the nomenklatura . 
[PER Lebedko  ] noted that the [ORG BKGB  ] had shady business dealings with the oil industry ( reftels ) and claimed the agency had set up dummy businesses in [LOC Russia  ] to launder money . 
[PER Lebedko  ] doubted the [ORG BKGB  ] 's illicit activities would change under [PER Zhadobin  ] 's leadership . 
Leader of the [ORG Belarusian Social Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG BSDP  ] ) " [PER Gramada  ] " [PER Nikolai Statkevich  ] opined that [PER Sukharenko  ] knew for a long time his position was in jeopardy , and for that reason " discovered " a [MISC Polish  ] spy ring to appease the president ( septel ) . 
However , even this could not save the former [ORG BKGB  ] chief . 
According to [PER Statkevich  ] , the [ORG BKGB  ] had long ceased to be an " intellectual " organization as it had been in the [ORG USSR  ] . 
Its first duty was to show absolute loyalty to the president , and professionalism and beliefs came in distant second . 
[ORG Newspaper Blames Power Shuffle  ] on Scuffle in [LOC Mogilyov  ] --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Journalists from the [MISC Belarusian  ] independent website " Your Country 's Tomorrow " on July 17 attributed [PER Sukharenko  ] 's removal to the July 12 beating of the Head of the [ORG State Control Committee  ] ( [ORG GosKontrol  ] ) [PER Zenon Lomat  ] . 
Political analyst [PER Vladimir Podgol  ] in a July 16 meeting mentioned that a group of " hooligans " pretending to be policemen severely beat [PER Lomat  ] while he was in [LOC Mogilyov  ] . 
According to the website , an angry [PER Naumov  ] sent his anti-mafia division of the [ORG Ministry of the Interior  ] ( MVD ) to [LOC Mogilyov  ] to arrest seven [ORG BKGB  ] agents and one [ORG Security Council  ] member for the attack . 
The website claims the attack was planned with the intention to " compromise " [PER Naumov  ] . 
The [ORG Prosecutor General 's Office  ] is conducting the investigation . 
Comment ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Sukharenko  ] 's removal comes as no surprise , as we had long noticed that the former [ORG BKGB  ] chief had fallen out of favor with [PER Lukashenko  ] . 
Our contacts continuously predicted that [PER Sukharenko  ] 's replacement would be a close contact of [PER Viktor Lukashenko  ] , giving the president 's son more control of the security services and making him one of the most powerful men , next to his father , in [LOC Belarus  ] . 
We too suspect that [PER Sukharenko  ] 's downfall was a result of his battle with [PER Naumov  ] and the corruption within the [ORG BKGB  ] ranks . 
We will continue to report on this development , particularly on [PER Sukharenko  ] 's future and his replacements .
