THE HAGUE 582 Classified By: POLECON Counselor [PER Andrew C. Mann  ] for reasons 1.5 ( b , d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: The [MISC Dutch  ] generally support the [LOC U.S.  ] approach on the [MISC Goldstone  ] report in [LOC New York  ] and [LOC Geneva  ] . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG MFA  ] hopes for additional information from the [LOC U.S.  ] on next steps on the [MISC Goldstone  ] report and on [LOC Middle East  ] peace negotiations . 
There is a high-level political conflict between Development Minister [PER Koenders  ] and FM [PER Verhagen  ] on the [MISC Goldstone  ] report . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) SUPPORTING USG: Post shared reftel A points with [ORG MFA  ] contacts on the [LOC Middle East  ] , human rights , and [ORG NATO  ] . 
[ORG MFA  ] policy officers [PER Dorine Wytema  ] ( [LOC Israel  ] , Peace Process ) , [PER Michael Thijssen  ] ( [LOC Palestine  ] ) , and [PER David Zeverijn  ] ( [LOC Israel  ] ) responded that the [MISC Dutch  ] are on the same line , with little daylight between [MISC Dutch  ] and [MISC American  ] positions . 
In [LOC New York  ] , the [MISC Dutch  ] support a broad focus in [LOC New York  ] on the progress of peace negotiations , rather than just a discussion of the [ORG Goldstone  ] report . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] are not certain whether they will intervene . 
However , the [ORG EU  ] will make a statement which includes the assertion that debate over the [ORG Goldstone  ] report belongs in [LOC Geneva  ] . 
[PER Zeverijn  ] suggested that additional statements by [ORG EU  ] members would sacrifice clarity and unity . 
In [LOC Geneva  ] , the [MISC Dutch  ] have not received definitive reporting on the [ORG EU  ] strategy . 
However , they believe the [LOC Jerusalem  ] element to the [MISC Palestinian  ] draft resolution is inappropriate , and that that specific issue should be considered by [ORG UNESCO  ] ( for the cultural issues ) and UNGA / UNSC ( for the political issues ) . 
FM [PER Verhagen  ] , and possibly Development Minister [PER Koenders  ] , are reviewing the proposed instructions for the [MISC Dutch  ] embassy in [LOC Geneva  ] . 
Staff has advised FM [PER Verhagen  ] to vote no on the current draft resolution from the [MISC Palestinians  ] , but the jury is still out as of October 15 . 
( [PER Note: Verhagen  ] supports the [LOC U.S.  ] approach and would probably support a no vote , but he must contend with [MISC Dutch  ] coalition politics -- see paragraph 4 . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) SEEKING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: [ORG MFA  ] contacts would welcome further details on the [LOC U.S.  ] strategy for action in the [ORG UN Third Committee  ] or plenary 3ebate on the [ORG Goldstone  ] report . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] would also welcome an update on progress with the peace talks after Special Envoy [PER Mitchell  ] 's recent visit. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [MISC DUTCH  ] POLITICAL FRICTION OVER REPORT: [PER Pieter De Gooijer  ] , Director General for Political Affairs ( P equivalent ) told Charge on October 1 that [PER Verhagen  ] ( of the [ORG Christian Democrat  ] party ) and [PER Koenders  ] ( of the [ORG Labor  ] party ) had a major argument in [LOC New York  ] over the [ORG Goldstone  ] report . 
[PER Verhagen  ] had proposed a letter to the [MISC Dutch  ] parliament finding fault with the report . 
According to [PER De Gooijer  ] , [PER Verhagen  ] believes we should tell [LOC Israel  ] , you have friends , but you have to make concessions . 
[PER Koenders  ] , who wants to push [LOC Israel  ] , went ballistic , prompting late-night mediation by PM [PER Balkenende  ] . 
[PER Balkenende  ] called in [PER De Gooijer  ] to draft compromise language for the letter . 
The letter defused the conflict in the [MISC Dutch  ] parliament over [LOC Israel  ] 's conduct , allowing the Parliament to turn to the more controversial issue of [LOC Afghanistan  ] .
