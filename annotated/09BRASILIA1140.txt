( C ) SUMMARY: [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] ( [ORG Itamaraty  ] ) officials raised [LOC Bolivia  ] , s nascent interest in trilateral counternarcotics cooperation with the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] during a late August meeting with [LOC U.S.  ] officials . 
In follow-up discussions with [MISC PolOffs  ] , [ORG Itamaraty  ] , s Head of the [ORG Department for South American Affairs  ] Amb . 
[PER Joao Luiz Pereira Pinto  ] clarified that they have yet to give much thought to the opportunity and that any engagement on this front is unlikely before [LOC Bolivia  ] , s December presidential elections . 
[ORG Pereira Pinto  ] said that the initial interest in trilateral cooperation was raised by [PER Choquehuanca  ] , but the [MISC Brazilians  ] have continued to raise it during subsequent meetings with the [MISC Bolivians  ] to keep the issue on the table . 
The overture from [ORG Itamaraty  ] represents a significant departure from previous signals regarding cooperation on regional counterdrug initiatives . 
Mission recommends engaging [ORG Itamaraty  ] prior to the [MISC Bolivian  ] elections to explore concrete ideas on how to work with [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
END SUMMARY . 
[ORG ITAMARATY  ] HIGHLIGHTS OPENING FOR CN COOPERATION WITH [LOC BOLIVIA  ] --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) During a lunch the Charge hosted for WHA DAS [PER Chris McMullen  ] on August 25 with seven senior [ORG Itamaraty  ] officials , [LOC Brazil  ] , s Under Secretary for [LOC Latin America Ambassador  ] [PER Enio Cordeiro  ] said [MISC Brazilian  ] FM [PER Celso Amorim  ] spoke with [MISC Bolivian  ] FM [PER David Choquehuanca  ] in late August the possibility of joint cooperation between their countries and the [LOC United States  ] on counternarcotics issues . 
[PER Cordeiro  ] suggested that the [MISC Bolivians  ] are waiting for a signal from the [LOC United States  ] to increase cooperation ( [ORG REF  ] A ) . 
[PER Cordeiro  ] commented that the [MISC Bolivians  ] had made it clear that counternarcotics cooperation with the [LOC United States  ] could not continue " as it was in the past " and had to respect [LOC Bolivia  ] , s sovereignty . 
( Comment: Although [PER Cordeiro  ] did not say explicitly that the [MISC Bolivians  ] would reject a [ORG DEA  ] presence , other [MISC Brazilian  ] officials have told us that they understand from the [MISC Bolivians  ] they are not willing to reestablish a connection with [ORG DEA  ] at this time . 
End Comment . 
) [LOC BOLIVIA  ] MISSION IN THE DARK --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [MISC PolOffs  ] met with the [MISC Bolivian  ] Embassy , s Charge [PER Maria Cristiane Linale  ] on 8 September . 
She was unaware of the discussions , but did not discount the possibility . 
( Note: As a career diplomat , she explained , she is not in her government , s confidence on many issues . 
End note . 
) . 
[PER Linale  ] believes that at the moment no major initiatives , let alone counternarcotics cooperation with the [LOC United States  ] , are likely to gain traction in [LOC Bolivia  ] , which will be " paralyzed " until the December elections pass . 
[PER Linale  ] opined that the viability of greater trilateral counternarcotics cooperation will depend in part on whether the new representation in [ORG Congress  ] is balanced or biased toward [PER Morales  ] and cocaleros . 
[PER Linale  ] also stressed that [MISC Brazilian  ] President [PER Lula  ] will have to play a role in pushing counternarcotics cooperation , which [MISC Brazilian  ] officials have made clear to her is an important issue for [LOC Brazil  ] as well because of the need to stem the flow of drugs entering [LOC Brazil  ] through [LOC Bolivia  ] , if it is to be taken on seriously in [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
TRILATERAL COOPERATION STILL JUST A THOUGHT FOR [ORG ITAMARATY  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG Pereira Pinto  ] , who also handles relations with [LOC Argentina  ] , [LOC Paraguay  ] , and [LOC Uruguay  ] , explained to [MISC PolOffs  ] in a meeting on September 8 that [PER Choquehuanca  ] first raised the idea of cooperation with [LOC Brazil  ] and the [LOC United States  ] on counternarcotics some time ago . 
[ORG Itamaraty  ] officials have since raised the idea of counternarcotics cooperation in a number of meetings with [MISC Bolivian  ] officials , only to be told that it was not the right time to discuss it , which [ORG Pereira Pinto  ] attributed to the upcoming election . 
He said [LOC Brazil  ] understands the need to wait , but will continue to raise the issue so that it is not forgotten. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG Pereira Pinto  ] said that after [LOC Bolivia  ] expelled [ORG DEA  ] it turned to [LOC Brazil  ] as the " rich neighbor , " assuming that [LOC Brasilia  ] would fill the vacuum left and provide large-scale [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001140 002.2 OF 002 funding . 
[LOC Bolivia  ] asked the [MISC Brazilians  ] for everything [ORG DEA  ] had previously provided . 
[ORG Pereira Pinto  ] said [LOC Brazil  ] is trying to be helpful , citing the GOB , s response to [LOC Bolivia  ] , s request for helicopters to patrol borders as one example , but added that , even if [LOC Brazil  ] wanted to take on such a role , [MISC Brazilian  ] law only allows for a diplomatic presence abroad and [MISC Brazilian  ] police on foreign soil can only attend to office work and cannot operate on the ground. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) When asked for ideas on how to move forward in establishing trilateral cooperation between [LOC Bolivia  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] , and the [LOC United States  ] , [ORG Pereira Pinto  ] promised to get back to [MISC PolOffs  ] after " doing some homework " on what [LOC Brazil  ] sees as the priorities and openings to begin such cooperation . 
[ORG Pereira Pinto  ] compared working with the [MISC Bolivians  ] to dealing with difficult poker players , claiming you never know what they are thinking about when they make requests . 
Decision-making in [LOC Bolivia  ] takes a very long time because the government must always reach a consensus and the interlocutors are frequently changing , he said , leaving no institutional memory . 
When asked if increased assistance in border patrolling would be one way ease into trilateral counternarcotics cooperation , [ORG Pereira Pinto  ] confirmed that there is a strong interest on [LOC Bolivia  ] , s part to increase its presence along the borders and strengthen joint patrolling with [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[ORG Pereira Pinto  ] warned , however , that when the [ORG Brazilian Federal Police  ] ( [ORG DPF  ] ) has tried to train [MISC Bolivian  ] police the candidates sent by the [MISC Bolivians  ] have often been unprepared and incapable of completing the training . 
[ORG Pereira Pinto  ] assured [MISC PolOffs  ] that any attempt to establish trilateral counternarcotics cooperation with [LOC Bolivia  ] will not negatively impact [ORG DEA  ] , s mission in [LOC Brazil  ] and current work related to [LOC Bolivia  ] conducted from [LOC Brazil  ] ; [LOC Brazil  ] is a sovereign country and will not allow [LOC Bolivia  ] to influence its decision to work with [ORG DEA  ] , he said . 
COMMENT: A SHIFT MOTIVATED BY NECESSITY ------------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [LOC Brazil  ] , s new interest in facilitating trilateral counternarcotics cooperation with the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Bolivia  ] is driven by a combination of factors: concern over its own increasing drug problems , its inability to replace [ORG DEA  ] , s presence and work in [LOC Bolivia  ] , the difficulty of working with [LOC Bolivia  ] on the ground , and its recognition that nascent regional efforts to deal with the problem may take years to yield results . 
[LOC Brazil  ] has long been a trafficking route for [MISC Andean  ] cocaine and is now the second largest market for cocaine in the world , according to the [ORG UN  ] . 
According to [ORG DEA  ] [LOC Brazil  ] sources , the working relationship between [LOC Bolivia  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] has proven difficult and the [ORG Federal Police  ] ( [ORG DPF  ] ) , which currently has only two [ORG DPF  ] agents in [LOC Bolivia  ] , knows it needs help dealing with its drug problem. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Despite longstanding excellent relations between USG law enforcement agencies and the [ORG DPF  ] , [ORG Itamaraty  ] has been generally resistant to law enforcement cooperation , and almost succeeded in preventing the relocation of [ORG DEA  ] agents from [LOC Bolivia  ] to [LOC Brazil  ] . 
So this latest overture from [ORG Itamaraty  ] represents a significant about-face . 
Although some [ORG Itamaraty  ] officials will likely continue to be suspicious of our law enforcement presence , the high-level with which this was raised with us by [ORG Itamaraty  ] should help minimize resistance elsewhere . 
Mission recommends that , in advance of the December elections in [LOC Bolivia  ] , we engage [ORG Itamaraty  ] on possibilities for concrete counterdrug cooperation , preferably on issues within the domain of the foreign relations ministries so as not to jeopardize ongoing cooperation between [ORG DEA  ] and the [ORG DPF  ] related to [LOC Bolivia  ] counterdrug matters . 
Our ability to make progress on counternarcotics issues with [LOC Bolivia  ] in the near future will also depend on [LOC Bolivia  ] , s reaction to the release of the [ORG Majors List  ] ( REF B .
