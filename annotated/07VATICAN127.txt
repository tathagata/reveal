( C ) Summary . 
[MISC Lebanese  ] ambassador to the [ORG Holy See  ] told [ORG Amb  ] . 
Rooney September 11 that the [ORG Holy See  ] values its contacts with the [LOC US  ] but feels [LOC US  ] should listen more closely to [LOC Vatican  ] views . 
The recent visit of the [MISC Syrian  ] deputy PM was mishandled by the [LOC Vatican  ] , which failed to deliver a clear message . 
Patriarch [PER Sfeir  ] 's recent visit to [LOC Rome  ] was also uncomfortable ; [PER Sfeir  ] knows his influence in [LOC Lebanon  ] is limited . 
It is important for the [ORG USG  ] to reach out to senior [LOC Vatican  ] officials , primarily Cardinal [PER Bertone  ] and Archbishop [PER Mamberti  ] . 
The [ORG Holy See  ] has good ties to [LOC Iran  ] but has not yet acted diplomatically to build on those ties with regard to [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Ambassador Rooney discussed the current situation in [LOC Lebanon  ] September 11 with [MISC Lebanese  ] ambassador to the [ORG Holy See  ] Naji [PER Abi Assi  ] ( protect ) . 
[ORG DCM  ] and Special Assistant also attended . 
Following are observations made by [PER Abi Assi  ] . 
-- The [ORG Holy See  ] sometimes complains that [ORG USG  ] officials don't listen to it ; but sometimes [ORG Holy See  ] fails to say anything when it has the opportunity . 
He said he had heard that Cardinal [PER Bertone  ] appreciated his recent conversations with Secretary [PER Rice  ] and Under Secretary [PER Burns  ] . 
-- [MISC Syrian  ] deputy president [PER Faruq al-Sharaa  ] , who met the Pope September 5 , went away satisfied because of the papal penchant to speak in general terms , which works in [LOC Syria  ] 's favor here . 
In this case , the Pope reportedly urged that " a president for all [MISC Lebanese  ] " be found , but did not go into detail about what exactly that would mean , or how it would be done . 
[LOC Syria  ] would be quite happy with a pro-Syrian president accepted by all [MISC Lebanese  ] -- hence al-Sharaa 's satisfaction at the meeting -- though the [ORG Holy See  ] had intended rather to urge that the choice be left to [MISC Lebanese  ] , i.e. that [LOC Syria  ] and others should not interfere . 
-- Patriarch [PER Sfeir  ] 's visit last week was in fact arranged by the [MISC Lebanese  ] ambassador to [LOC Italy  ] , and [PER Sfeir  ] had not sought any [ORG Holy See  ] meetings ; this caused some friction with the [ORG Holy See  ] when it learned of his visit ( [LOC Vatican  ] meetings did eventually occur ) . 
In [PER Abi Assi  ] 's view , the Patriarch is relatively unable to influence events in [LOC Lebanon  ] , and knows it ; he is respected but not feared , and [MISC Christian  ] factions feel free to ignore his pleas . 
[PER Sfeir  ] is still mistrustful of the [LOC U.S.  ] because of some misunderstandings in the 1990s relating to proposed candidates for election to office in [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
( Note: [PER Abi Assi  ] noted that although the Maronite Church is in full communion with [LOC Rome  ] , it is self-governing -- in other words , the Patriarch cannot be dismissed and is essentially independent . 
) -- According to [PER Abi Assi  ] , the [ORG USG  ] should make a greater effort to reach out to Cardinal [PER Bertone  ] and Archbishop [PER Mamberti  ] , rather than focusing on the Pope . 
The [ORG Holy See  ] 's small structure means that top officials rely heavily on individual experts to shape their policies ; in this case , the key individual is Monsignor [PER Franco Coppola  ] ( more or less equivalent to an office director ) , whose memos directly influence all his superiors . 
[PER Coppola  ] himself , though not openly anti-American , is very critical of the [LOC US  ] role in the [LOC Middle East  ] and repeatedly reminds listeners that President [PER Bush  ] should have listened to papal envoy Cardinal [PER Pio Laghi  ] , whom [PER John Paul II  ] had sent to [LOC Washington  ] in 2003 to plead that the [LOC US  ] avoid war in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
-- The [ORG Holy See  ] maintains dialogue with [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Iran  ] , and urges the [LOC US  ] to do so too . 
[LOC Iran  ] places much value on its relationship with the [LOC Vatican  ] , has a significant presence here , and maintains a vigorous dialogue with the [ORG Holy See  ] . 
The [ORG Holy See  ] has not , however , taken the initiative with either [LOC Syria  ] or [LOC Iran  ] to seek solutions to any of the regional problems involving those countries . 
In the case of [LOC Lebanon  ] , [PER Abi Assi  ] is certain that both [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Iran  ] are acting from self-interest rather than ideology , and therefore are potentially open to other courses of action . 
-- Until now , [PER Mamberti  ] has been continuously feeling his way and no clear policy has evolved . 
One day soon , however , [PER Mamberti  ] will advise [PER Bertone  ] clearly of his position , and then [ORG Holy See  ] policy will be fixed . 
So , according to [PER Abi Assi  ] , we should act now to influence [PER Mamberti  ] . 
-- [PER Michel Aoun  ] has power to block any president in [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
-- [PER Papal Nuncio Gatti  ] is an expert on [LOC Lebanon  ] but is worn out , not active ; however , no sign that he will be replaced . 
-- The most successful [ORG Holy See  ] role in [LOC Lebanon  ] will not be direct ( as in uniting [MISC Christians  ] or persuading [PER Sfeir  ] ) but rather through influence with [LOC Lebanon  ] 's neighbors . 
-- [PER Abi Assi  ] had high praise for [MISC French Middle  ] East envoy [PER Jean-Claude Cousseran  ] . 
[LOC VATICAN  ] 00000127 002.2 OF 002 <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Comment: we have found [ORG Amb  ] . 
[PER Abi Assi  ] to be consistently well informed and active . 
In particular we would agree on the need for us to focus on [PER Mamberti  ] in the near future , as his influence on the [ORG Holy See  ] 's approach to [LOC Lebanon  ] will continue to be very strong .
