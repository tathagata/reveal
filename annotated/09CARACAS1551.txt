( C ) SUMMARY: [MISC Venezuelan  ] doctors have accused the [MISC Venezuelan  ] Government ( [ORG GBRV  ] ) of politicizing health care at the expense of the health of [MISC Venezuelans  ] . 
In recent months , protests have paralyzed hospitals across [LOC Venezuela  ] as doctors and patients have complained of shortages of medical supplies , delays in hospital renovations and unpaid wages and benefits . 
Observers describe public hospitals as increasingly dangerous places where underpaid , undersupplied , and understaffed doctors struggle to provide medical services to [LOC Venezuela  ] 's poor . 
Critics say that the [ORG GBRV  ] has created a parallel medical system- " Barrio Adentro " -that has sucked resources away from the traditional hospital network and reduced the overall quality of medical services . 
The [ORG GBRV  ] has suspended doctors for speaking out about the crisis while giving former military officers and community councils a greater role in hospital administration . 
On November 29 , President [PER Chavez  ] announced plans to eliminate a government health care benefit that pays for public workers to receive health care at private clinics , a move that would place even greater strain on already overburdened public hospitals . 
END SUMMARY . 
HOSPTIAL CRISIS SPREADS ACROSS THE COUNTRY <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In recent months , newspapers across [LOC Venezuela  ] have carried daily reports of a growing crisis in the public hospitals . 
On November 30 , for example , " [MISC Notitarde  ] " published reports of a vigil by patients and doctors to protest shortages of medicines and supplies at the [LOC Enrique Tejera Hospital  ] ; on December 1 , [LOC Ciudad Guayana  ] 's " Correo del [LOC Caroni  ] " covered the " technical closure " of the [ORG Negra Hipolita Maternity Ward  ] after the breakdown of the air conditioning system raised concerns that the heat would increase bacteria levels in the incubators for newborn babies ; and on December 4 , the daily " [ORG El Universal  ] " reported that doctors in [LOC Merida  ] had shut down the [ORG University Hospital of Los Andes  ] ( [ORG HULA  ] ) due to medical supply shortages , pronouncing the hospital " dead . 
" DOCTORS PROTEST DETERIORATION OF PUBLIC HOSPITALS <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On November 18 , in a development representative of the breakdown of public hospitals across the country , the [PER Jesus Yerena  ] de [ORG Lidice Hospital  ] shut down after 140 physicians announced their mass resignation . 
[ORG Lidice  ] is one of the two largest and most important public hospitals in the impoverished [LOC Catia  ] municipality of [LOC Caracas  ] ; it serves a poor and marginalized community that otherwise has little access to health care. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) For over three months , [ORG Lidice  ] 's patients and doctors have protested shortages of medical supplies , delays in the renovation of hospital wards , and unpaid wages and benefits . 
But the conflict escalated on November 16 , when the [ORG Health Ministry  ] suspended four of [ORG Lidice  ] 's doctors after charging them with inciting protests among the patients . 
[ORG Lidice  ] 's doctors resigned en masse after the [ORG Health Ministry  ] refused to reinstate the four suspended doctors and resume negotiations over salary payments and benefits owed since <a id='par2007' href='#par2007'>¶</a>2007 . 
The resignations paralyzed [ORG Lidice  ] , leaving only two doctors-an internal specialist and a surgeon-to care for the remaining patients. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Although [ORG Lidice  ] reopened on November 20 after the Health and [ORG Labor Ministry  ] agreed to reinstate the four suspended physicians and resume negotiations over other demands , the [LOC CARACAS  ] 00001551 002 OF 004 emergency pediatrics unit and maternity ward remain closed for renovation . 
The maternity ward of the [ORG Lidice  ] hospital-considered the second most important in [LOC Caracas  ] for many years-has now been closed for two years , while [LOC Catia  ] 's other major public hospital , [LOC Los Magallanes  ] [PER Jose Gregorio Hernandez  ] , has been partially closed for over a year while awaiting renovation . 
PUBLIC HOSPITALS ARE DANGEROUS , UNDERSUPPLIED , AND UNDERSTAFFED <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) During a private meeting on November 10 , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , a health reporter for the " [ORG El Universal  ] " newspaper , described the public hospitals as increasingly dangerous places , where underpaid , undersupplied , and understaffed doctors work in unsanitary conditions to provide medical services to [LOC Venezuela  ] 's poor . 
Due to shortages of basic medical supplies , doctors ask patients to purchase their own needles , disinfectants and gauze . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told EmbOffs that doctors sometimes dress wounds with the same dirty bandages . 
Other patients are told to bring their own X-rays from private clinics . 
As in many areas of [LOC Caracas  ] , public hospitals suffer from water shortages , forcing doctors to postpone important operations . 
In some of the older public hospitals , the plumbing systems cannot pump water above the first few floors of the building. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] estimated that medical residents in public hospitals make an average of 2,000 bolivars ( [ORG BsF  ] ) per month ( USD 930 at the official rate of 2.15 [ORG BsF  ] to the dollar ) . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , over fifty percent of the resident doctors move to the capital from other parts of the country , and their salary is barely enough to cover rent in [LOC Caracas  ] , where an austere apartment in a dangerous neighbourhood can easily cost 1,800 bolivars per month . 
Consequently , many doctors have left the public hospitals in search of other jobs , while some of the most qualified have left the country to earn better salaries abroad . 
In a December 4 press report , the [ORG Venezuelan Medical Federation  ] ( [ORG FMV  ] ) estimated that the public hospitals are understaffed by 43 percent. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Crime has further contributed to the flight of doctors from the public sector . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that criminals go to the public hospitals to rob , steal , and even kill patients . 
The emergency room in Hospital [PER Vargas  ] is only open for twelve hours-between seven in the morning and seven at night-because of security concerns . 
In October , a shootout in the emergency room of the [LOC Los Magallanes de Catia  ] hospital killed two people . 
Although the [ORG Ministry of Health  ] has promised to send more guards to protect the hospitals , in many cases the additional security has not arrived . 
SEE NO EVIL , HEAR NO EVIL , SPEAK NO EVIL <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) On November 17 , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told EconOff that the [ORG GBRV  ] has suspended doctors to discourage them from speaking out about the health care crisis . 
Last year four doctors were suspended when they exposed the accidental death of six babies in a maternity ward . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , the [ORG GBRV  ] has limited the role of the resident doctors in hospital management and transferred authority to local community councils . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that community council members meet with hospital directors to discuss renovation proposals . 
On November 10 , the director for the [ORG Vargas Hospital of Caracas  ] , [PER Francisco Hernandez  ] , told the press that he had to present the hospital 's renovation proposals to the community councils before sending them to the [ORG Health Ministry  ] and President [PER Chavez  ] for approval . 
[LOC CARACAS  ] 00001551 003 OF 004 [MISC BARRIO  ] [PER ADENTRO  ] DRAINS RESOURCES FROM PUBLIC HOSPITALS <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told EmbOffs that the quality of health care in the public hospitals has deteriorated as the [ORG GBRV  ] has redirected resources to " [MISC Barrio Adentro  ] , " a program staffed by the [MISC Cuban  ] Government that provides free medical services in poor areas ( Ref A ) . 
Although " [MISC Barrio Adentro  ] " has translated into political gains for President [PER Chavez  ] , its medical impact is questionable , despite having received massive government investment ( Note: The [ORG GBRV  ] spent approximately USD 5.6 billion on [MISC Cuban  ] medical assistance , training , medicines , vaccines , and other services in 2008 , according to one estimate . 
See Ref A for further analysis of [MISC Barrio Adentro  ] . 
End Note . 
) . 
While [PER Chavez  ] has acknowledged a " crisis " in " [MISC Barrio Adentro  ] " and announced a sweeping campaign to revitalize the program , neither President [PER Chavez  ] nor his ministers have announced new plans for additional investment in the traditional public hospital system. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) On October 5 , the President of the [ORG Venezuelan Medical Federation  ] ( [ORG FMV  ] ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told EmbOffs that the health care problem is primarily political . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , the [ORG GBRV  ] has focused resources on the development of a parallel medical system- " [MISC Barrio  ] [PER Adentro  ] " -that has sucked investment away from the hospitals and the traditional medical infrastructure to the detriment of the health of [MISC Venezuelans  ] . 
At the same time , the [ORG GBRV  ] has appointed military professionals with no medical background to important positions in the [ORG Ministry of Health  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that there is " anarchy " in the [ORG Ministry of Health  ] , pointing out that the [ORG GBRV  ] has released health statistics just four times in the last 14 months . 
[ORG FMV  ] Vice [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] added that vaccination rates have decreased dramatically over the past several years. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) While the [ORG GBRV  ] has prioritized " [MISC Barrio  ] [PER Adentro  ] " over the traditional medical system , [MISC Venezuelans  ] seem to prefer public hospitals or private clinics . 
On October 9 , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told EmbOffs that the majority of [MISC Venezuelans  ] continue to receive medical care in public hospitals or private clinics rather than " [MISC Barrio  ] [PER Adentro  ] . 
" [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] cited a 2006 study by a team of [ORG European Union  ] analysts that measured the use of health services by sector ( i.e. , public hospitals , private clinics , or " [MISC Barrio  ] [PER Adentro  ] " ) and confirmed that poorer [MISC Venezuelans  ] were more likely to receive medical care in public hospitals than " [MISC Barrio  ] [PER Adentro  ] . 
" [PER CHAVEZ  ] THREATENS TO ELIMINATE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE BENEFIT <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On November 29 , in a move that further illustrated [ORG GBRV  ] efforts to strengthen " [MISC Barrio  ] [PER Adentro  ] " as an alternative to the traditional medical system , [PER Chavez  ] announced his intention to eliminate the hospitalization , surgery , and maternity ( [ORG HCM  ] ) benefit that public sector employees use to pay for health care at private clinics . 
During a broadcast of the " Hello , President " radio and television program , [PER Chavez  ] said that the [ORG HCM  ] benefit supported the " bourgeoisie " owners of private clinics and that public employees should instead use " [MISC Barrio  ] [PER Adentro  ] 's " network of [ORG Integral Diagnostic Centers  ] . 
In press reports the following day , public employees in the petroleum , iron , steel , and aluminum sectors protested the announcement ( Note: According to one press report , sixty percent of the 12 million [MISC Venezuelans  ] with health insurance work in the public sector . 
End Note . 
) . 
Critics pointed out that the private clinics offer medical services that " [MISC Barrio  ] [PER Adentro  ] " [LOC CARACAS  ] 00001551 004 OF 004 does not provide , and that the public hospitals do not have the capacity to absorb a massive influx of new patients from the private clinics . 
On September 23 , deputies for the pro-Chavez [ORG United Socialist Party of Venezuela  ] ( [ORG PSUV  ] ) told EmbOffs that changes to the medical insurance system would be imposed progressively given the sensitivity of the issue ( Ref B ) . 
COMMENT <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) The quality of health care in [LOC Venezuela  ] has declined as the [ORG GBRV  ] has shifted resources from the traditional medical system to " [MISC Barrio  ] [PER Adentro  ] . 
" Resource-starved public hospitals are beginning to show the effects of years of neglect . 
Mismanagement has increased as military officers and community council members-usually with little previous experience in health care-have assumed a greater role in the administration of public hospitals . 
At the same time , the hospitals suffer from the same problems that plague the rest of [MISC Venezuelan  ] society , including the deterioration of infrastructure , an increase in crime , and the flight of the professional class . 
Despite these issues , President [PER Chavez  ] and other members of his cabinet have not publicly acknowledged the deterioration of the public hospitals or announced any new plans to revitalize them . 
To the extent that President [PER Chavez  ] has acknowledged [LOC Venezuela  ] 's health care crisis , the [ORG GBRV  ] has looked to " [MISC Barrio Adentro  ] " and [MISC Cuba-and  ] not the public hospitals-as the solution. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Meanwhile , " [MISC Barrio Adentro  ] " has not proven to be a viable substitute for the public hospitals despite massive [ORG GBRV  ] attention and investment . 
Indeed , the evidence suggests that all classes of [MISC Venezuelans  ] continue to prefer public hospitals to " [MISC Barrio Adentro  ] , " even as the quality of medical services in the former has deteriorated . 
The popular preference for public hospitals means that the traditional medical system must treat a growing number of patients with dwindling resources , a problem that will only intensify if the [ORG GBRV  ] decides to eliminate the health care benefit for public employees , forcing them out of the private clinics and into the public hospitals . 
Another possible consequence is the risk that the [ORG GBRV  ] will look to expropriate private sector medical facilities .
