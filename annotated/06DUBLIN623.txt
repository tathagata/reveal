( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] The [MISC Irish  ] Government would not agree to extend the November 24 deadline for the [ORG Northern Assembly  ] to form an Executive , due to the likely distractions of the mid-2007 [MISC Irish  ] general elections , Prime Minister ( [ORG Taoiseach  ] ) [PER Bertie Ahern  ] told Special Envoy for [LOC Northern Ireland  ] [PER Mitchell Reiss  ] and the Ambassador on May 22 .

In a separate discussion , Foreign Minister [PER Dermot Ahern  ] told [PER Reiss  ] that a single , [MISC Southern-hosted  ] investment conference on the [LOC North  ] would be preferable to two separate conferences ( a view that [MISC Northern  ] Secretary [PER Peter Hain  ] accepted in a May 24 phone call with [PER Reiss  ] ) . 
In another meeting , Justice Minister [PER Micheal McDowell  ] briefed [PER Reiss  ] and the Ambassador on pending [MISC Northern-related  ] legal casesXXXXXXXXXXXX . 
End summary . 
The November 24 Deadline and Plan B ----------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Under no circumstances would the [MISC Irish  ] Government agree to extend the November 24 deadline for the [ORG Northern Ireland Assembly  ] to form an Executive , Prime Minister ( [ORG Taoiseach  ] ) [PER Bertie Ahern  ] told Special Envoy for [LOC Northern Ireland  ] [PER Mitchell Reiss  ] and the Ambassador on May 22 . 
[PER Ahern  ] explained that , if the deadline were not met , “Plan B” ( indefinite suspension of the [ORG Assembly  ] and joint [MISC UK/Irish  ] stewardship of the [MISC Northern  ] political process ) would take effect , as the campaign for the expected May 2007 [MISC Irish  ] general elections would preclude his continued involvement in [MISC Northern  ] negotiations . 
He added that he had been clear with the [ORG British Government  ] on this point and that any effort to establish an Executive after November 24 would fall to the parties . 
[PER Ahern  ] said he would not be surprised , however , if the parties were to press for a delay beyond the deadline , notwithstanding the long lead-up to November . 
( Comment: Were the [MISC Irish  ] and [ORG British Governments  ] to hold the line on the November 24 deadline , they would be showing atypical resolve . 
We suspect that the decision whether or not to extend the deadline will be taken closer to the date . 
) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) While Plan B would help force the parties , feet to the fire , fleshing out Plan B in more detail now would distract the parties from the November 24 deadline , said [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , who also attended the meeting with [PER Ahern  ] and [PER Reiss  ] . 
In any case , Plan B has not been drafted , noted [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
He expressed hope that the [ORG Independent Monitoring Commission  ] ( [ORG IMC  ] ) report due in early October would show enough republican progress on criminality to catalyze the negotiations , keeping the focus off Plan [PER B. He  ] added that the [ORG Democratic Unionist Party  ] ( [ORG DUP  ] ) risked a huge tactical error in believing that a deal might be achievable after November 24 , since [ORG Sinn Fein  ] might abandon the negotiation process completely after that deadline . 
The [ORG DUP’s Refusal  ] to Engage --------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Ahern  ] expressed disappointment with the [ORG DUP’s  ] refusal to engage with [ORG Sinn Fein  ] , particularly “childish” tactics at the [ORG Northern Assembly Stormont Buildings  ] like ducking out of elevators carrying [ORG Sinn Fein  ] members . 
He pointed out that there had been over 30 instances of quiet contact between the [ORG DUP  ] and [ORG Sinn Fein  ] during the December 2004 negotiations . 
Since the collapse of those talks and the subsequent [ORG Northern Bank  ] robbery and [PER McCartney  ] murder , engagement had ceased . 
[PER Ahern  ] cited [ORG Sinn Fein  ] leader [PER Gerry Adams’  ] view that the IRA’s July 2005 decision to decommission weapons should have merited renewed contact with the [ORG DUP  ] at some level , not [LOC DUBLIN  ] 00000623 002.2 OF 003 necessarily with [ORG DUP  ] leader [PER Ian Paisley  ] . 
[ORG DUP  ] resistance to engagement , he added , was leading the republican community to question [PER Adams’  ] overall strategy for the peace process . 
[PER Ahern  ] admitted that he did not know what would make the [ORG DUP  ] speak with [ORG Sinn Fein  ] , and he hoped that the [ORG Northern Assembly’s  ] proposed [ORG Restoration Committee  ] might be a vehicle for interaction . 
( At roughly the same time as Special Envoy Reiss’ meeting with [PER Ahern  ] , [PER Paisley  ] announced that the [ORG DUP  ] would not take part in the [ORG Committee  ] as a mechanism for negotiations . 
) Policing and [ORG Sinn Fein  ] ---------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [MISC Northern  ] policing issue would not be resolved until the formation of the Executive , said [PER Ahern  ] . 
He elaborated that [ORG Sinn Fein  ] tacticians would not want to “hand over their last card” with a commitment to joint policing before November , since the [ORG DUP  ] would then discount that card in the negotiations . 
[PER Ahern  ] doubted that the [ORG DUP  ] even wanted the devolution of policing at this point . 
He added that there was therefore little sense in making [ORG Sinn Fein  ] endorsement for joint policing a precondition in the [MISC Northern  ] negotiations . 
He added , however , that the republican community was increasingly amenable to such an endorsement . 
2006: Good Progress and Next Steps ---------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) On the whole , 2006 has been a very positive year , particularly in terms of progress in the republican community , [PER Ahern  ] observed . 
He noted that there was increasing engagement on the ground between the Police Service of [LOC Northern Ireland  ] ( [ORG PSNI  ] ) and republican areas of [LOC Belfast  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] pointed out that the [MISC Irish  ] and [ORG British Governments  ] were pleasantly surprised by the public’s and parties’ reactions to the April 6 statement that the [ORG Assembly  ] would reconvene . 
The only negative republican occurrences during the year , said [PER Ahern  ] , had been the April 4 murder of [PER Denis Donaldson  ] ( the former [ORG IRA  ] official who was out-ed as a [MISC British  ] informant ) , the robbery of a liquor truck by alleged [ORG IRA  ] members , and the discovery of a 250 lb. fertilizer bomb in [LOC Lurgan  ] . 
[PER Ahern  ] maintained that these incidents were the work of [ORG IRA  ] breakaway groups who were not connected with [ORG Sinn Fein  ] leadership . 
He added that [ORG Sinn Fein  ] seemed surprised and shaken by the [PER Donaldson  ] murder and , ironically , had supported the April 6 statement calling for reestablishment of [LOC Stormont  ] even more strongly as a result. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) In terms of next steps , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] observed that Prime Ministers [PER Ahern  ] and [PER Blair  ] planned to meet with all parties on June 26 . 
In the expectation that there would be no progress by that point , the goal of the late June consultations would be to map out the agenda for the period remaining before late November . 
The Governments , added [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , would then “bed down for the summer.” He explained that the [MISC Irish  ] Government would continue to listen carefully to the parties’ rhetoric in order to gauge their seriousness about making the [ORG Good Friday Agreement  ] work . 
[PER Reiss: No  ] Urgency among Parties ------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) In his discussion with the [ORG Taoiseach  ] ( and in separate meetings , per paras below ) , Special Envoy [PER Reiss  ] reported from his May 19 discussions at [LOC Stormont  ] that he sensed no urgency among the parties , particularly the [ORG DUP  ] , to commence work on an Executive deal . 
He noted that [ORG DUP  ] was likely to ignore the November 24 deadline in public defiance of the [MISC British  ] and [MISC Irish  ] Governments . 
The [ORG DUP  ] also appeared confident that it could achieve in the first few months after November any deal that was achievable by November 24 . 
[PER Reiss  ] elaborated that [ORG DUP  ] leaders indicated no intention of engaging [ORG Sinn Fein  ] , partly out of fear that negotiations with [PER Gerry Adams  ] would see the unionist community “lose its shirt.” <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [ORG Sinn Fein  ] leaders , by contrast , were relaxed in their discussions with [PER Reiss  ] , with [PER Gerry Adams  ] focused on USG permission for fund-raising activities in the [LOC United States  ] in the fall . 
[PER Reiss  ] believed that [PER Adams  ] was prepared to endorse joint policing , not only to avoid blame if the November 24 deadline passed , but also to project a positive political image for [ORG Sinn Fein  ] in the [ORG South’s  ] 2007 general elections . 
[PER Adams  ] also suggested that a [ORG Sinn Fein Executive Council  ] decision , rather than a full party conference , might be sufficient to endorse policing . 
[PER Reiss  ] agreed with the [ORG Taoiseach  ] that there had been progress in the republican community , as was evident from friendly interaction with the [ORG PSNI  ] that would have been impossible six months ago . 
[LOC DUBLIN  ] 00000623 003.2 OF 003 FM [PER Ahern  ] Opposes Proposals for Two [ORG Investment Conferences  ] --------------------------------------------- ------------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) In a separate discussion that reviewed most of the issues raised in the [MISC Taoiseach’s  ] meeting , Foreign Minister [PER Dermot Ahern  ] said that there was no point in having two [LOC Northern Ireland  ] investment conferences in the fall that would be sponsored by the [LOC North  ] and [LOC South  ] , respectively . 
He remarked that whereas plans for the proposed [MISC Northern-sponsored  ] conference lacked focus and details , the [ORG South’s  ] conference would work and would proceed regardless . 
[PER Reiss  ] agreed that a single conference would be better , and he asked for the opportunity to speak first to the [MISC British  ] Government about this preference . 
( Comment: On May 24 , [PER Reiss  ] discussed the conference proposal with [MISC Northern  ] Secretary [PER Peter Hain  ] , who agreed to put off the [MISC Northern-sponsored  ] conference until 2007 . 
) [ORG DOJ Update  ] on Legal Cases ------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Special Envoy [PER Reiss  ] and the Ambassador also met with Minister of [ORG Justice  ] and Equality [PER Michael McDowell  ] . 
[MISC Irish  ] Department of [ORG Justice  ] ( [ORG DOJ  ] ) officialsXXXXXXXXXXXX who made the following points about [MISC Northern Ireland-related  ] legal cases: XXXXXXXXXXXX B ) Money Launderers . 
Before November , the [MISC Irish  ] Government would bring charges against several individuals connected to the police seizure of several million pound sterling in February 2005 , believed to be from the 2004 [ORG Northern Bank  ] robbery.XXXXXXXXXXXX E ) [PER Denis Donaldson  ] . 
[PER McDowell  ] believed that the out-ing of [PER Denis Donaldson  ] as an informant was a clear message from the [MISC British  ] Government that it had another , more valuable , source of information within the republican leadership . 
He reiterated the [MISC Taoiseach’s  ] point , however , that [ORG Sinn Fein  ] leaders appeared to have had no connection to [MISC Donaldson’s  ] murder .
