( U ) SUMMARY: Director of the [ORG Office of Drug Control Policy John Walters  ] visited [LOC Afghanistan  ] March 17-20 to discuss with senior [MISC Afghan  ] and international officials this year’s progress on reducing the poppy crop . 
Senior [ORG ISAF  ] officials told [PER Walters  ] that although eradicating poppy would , in their estimation , increase the security threat , it needed to be done and they would be as supportive as their mandate allowed . 
[ORG ISAF  ] is also increasingly convinced of the links between narcotics traffickers and insurgents . 
Senior [MISC Afghan  ] government officials agreed with the need to take strong action against growers and traffickers but acknowledged that widespread corruption and the weakness of the justice system made that difficult . 
Many made the point that considerable progress in other parts of the country was at risk of being overshadowed by the lack of progress in [LOC Helmand  ] . 
They all emphasized the importance of increasing development aid , and pitched the idea of funneling more assistance through government ministries instead of international contractors . 
Lastly , [PER Walters  ] visited the [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Eradication Force  ] base camp in [LOC Helmand  ] , where discussions with Deputy Minister of Interior for Counter-narcotics [PER Mohammad Daud  ] and local elders illustrated how difficult it is for the central government to exert its authority on controversial issues . 
END SUMMARY . 
[PER KARZAI  ] NEEDS TO TAKE ACTION --------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NOFORN ) ONDCP Director [PER Walters  ] met with [ORG COM ISAF  ] General [PER McNeill  ] in [LOC Kabul  ] , and separately with RC South Commander Major General [PER Van Loon  ] ( [MISC Dutch  ] ) in [LOC Kandahar  ] . 
[PER McNeill  ] told [PER Walters  ] there had been a lot of action on counter-narcotics , but little progress . 
He was particularly dismayed by the [MISC British  ] effort . 
They had made a mess of things in [LOC Helmand  ] , their tactics were wrong , and the deal that [LOC London  ] cut on [LOC Musa Qala  ] had failed . 
That agreement opened the door to narco-traffickers in that area , and now it was impossible to tell the difference between the traffickers and the insurgents . 
The [MISC British  ] could do a lot more , he said , and should , because they have the biggest stake. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NOFORN ) [PER McNeill  ] thought the missing ingredient in the counter-narcotics effort was [PER Karzai  ] . 
Despite some public statements , he had failed to take a real stand . 
[PER Karzai  ] needed to keep his support base happy , and as a result , he placated many of those involved in the drug business , especially in the west and south of the country . 
However , by not taking the issue on , [PER Karzai  ] was tacitly signaling his [LOC OK  ] for poppy production . 
While the international community could come down harder on [PER Karzai  ] , [PER McNeill  ] observed that for the time being , [PER Karzai  ] is the only one who can lead , so for now we have to ride with him . 
The counter-narcotics effort has to have an [MISC Afghan  ] face , and that is going to take time . 
HIGH VALUE TARGETS ------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) To Walters’ question on going after high value targets , [PER McNeill  ] said it was necessary to prosecute a few to keep faith with the general public . 
But he was skeptical it would have any real effect on the trafficking networks , as those arrested would simply be replaced by others . 
[PER McNeill  ] described having been called to answer questions before the [MISC Afghan  ] parliament , and said that during the session , the parliament had come down hard on [LOC MOI Zarar  ] for not doing more on narcotics arrests and basic law enforcement . 
[PER McNeill  ] also criticized the timing and conduct of eradication , arguing that farmers eradicated in the spring would be fighting by summer . 
He asserted that [MISC Governor-led  ] eradication was extremely disorganized and said that , for now , eradicators are only going where the local power brokers allow them to go . 
He suggested that there be a more direct link between eradication and provision of assistance , so that a compact with the people could be created . 
[LOC KABUL  ] 00001132 002 OF 004 [PER VAN LOON  ] AGREEMENT ON TIMING , NEED FOR ASSISTANCE --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In a meeting the next day in [LOC Kandahar  ] , RC South commander Major General [PER Van Loon  ] , who was accompanied for part of the meeting by [LOC Kandahar  ] Governor [PER Asadullah  ] , argued that provision of alternative livelihoods needs to start much earlier . 
Once the poppy seeds are in the ground , there is no option for the farmer . 
Provision of licit crops and other assistance needed to start early in the summer , before farmers made planting decisions . 
Both [PER Asadullah  ] and [PER Van Loon  ] thought cooperation among the central government , assistance providers , and eradication elements was poor . 
While farmers are promised alternatives , they do not often see results on a local level . 
There needs to be more active involvement with local councils , and there should be more of a direct link between development assistance and non-cultivation of poppy . 
[PER Van Loon  ] suggested this approach would work in [LOC Kandahar  ] , where farmers were making their own decisions on what to grow , but would probably not work in [LOC Helmand  ] , where large-scale traffickers were in charge . 
[MISC GOVERNOR-LED  ] ERADICATION AND PROBLEMS OF CORRUPTION --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Following Asadullah’s departure , [PER Van Loon  ] agreed that the Governor was making progress on eradication , but he took issue with his targets and methods . 
[PER Asadullah  ] was using [MISC Afghan  ] Police ( [ORG ANP  ] ) to do eradication , which further damaged the already corrupt reputation of the police among average people , and allowed [PER Asadullah  ] to pocket the funding he had been given to hire local labor to carry out eradication . 
The employment of [ORG ANP  ] in eradication means they are not out in the community performing their security functions . 
In addition , [PER Van Loon  ] said [PER Asadullah  ] has been careful to eradicate only those fields not controlled by powerful people in the [LOC Province.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Van Loon  ] was somewhat defensive in discussing the failure of Uruzgan Governor Monib to take any action on eradication . 
He argued that the security situation was outside the [MISC Governor’s  ] control , and prevented him from moving around much . 
In addition , the province is extremely poor , and so until more alternative livelihoods are available , the international community should not push too hard on eradication . 
He said that Monib understood the need to do something , and plans were now being drawn up with the [MISC British  ] Embassy Drugs team and the [ORG Ministry of Counter-narcotics.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) RC South has begun developing information on ties between traffickers , insurgents , and government officials . 
They recognize that going after corrupt officials may be too difficult , given the delicate tribal and other balances needed to keep the [MISC Afghan  ] government generally intact . 
But they hope to use the increasing connections between traffickers and insurgents to their advantage ; the latter are a legitimate target for [ORG ISAF  ] , while pursuing the former is not within ISAF’s direct mandate . 
VISIT TO [LOC HELMAND  ] ---------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) On March 20 Director [PER Walters  ] visited the INL-funded [MISC Afghan  ] Eradication Force’s ( [ORG AEF  ] ) forward operating base in [LOC Helmand  ] . 
During the visit he discussed [LOC Helmand  ] eradication with Deputy Interior Minister [PER Daud  ] and members of the provincial eradication commission , who represented tribal elders and the poppy growing communities in the operating areas of the [ORG AEF  ] base . 
[PER Walters  ] told [PER Daud  ] and the commission members that he was disappointed with the recent lack of eradication progress in areas with the highest concentration of poppy cultivation , like [PER Marja  ] sub-district . 
The commission responded that [LOC Helmand  ] needs time--a few growing seasons--to wean farmers away from dependence on the poppy crop . 
[PER Walters  ] acknowledged that eradication affects farmers , but he reminded the commission that [LOC Helmand  ] enjoys other [LOC KABUL  ] 00001132 003 OF 004 agricultural options and has the potential to become Afghanistan’s “bread basket.” All farmers , he said , know that growing poppy is illegal , and they must also learn that poppy cultivation feeds insecurity in the province and throughout [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[ORG GOA  ] MINISTERS - MORE ASSISTANCE THROUGH THE GOVERNMENT --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Walters  ] met over dinner with a number of [MISC Afghan  ] officials , including the Ministers of Interior , Agriculture , [MISC Counter-narcotics  ] , and Education , the Chief of the [ORG National Directorate of Security  ] , and a member of Parliament . 
The wide-ranging discussion included talks on the kinds of alternative crops that could profitably be grown around the country , the challenge of fighting corruption and creating a functioning judicial system , and the general pre-requisite for licit livelihoods of energy , irrigation , and roads. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Two themes emerged . 
First , there should be much more active involvement by local government in decision-making on what kind of assistance is provided . 
Billions are being spent around the country , but the perception at the local level is that little is being done . 
Involving local government , whether through [ORG Provincial Development Councils  ] , the Governors , or other mechanisms , will help address this problem . 
Second , Ministers unanimously called for more assistance to be channeled through the government , rather than through international contractors . 
They argued that unless this happened , capacity in the [ORG Ministries  ] would never be built . 
It would also lead the population to conclude that central government officials , rather than [MISC Taliban  ] or other insurgents , could deliver now and in the future . 
While all acknowledged the challenges of maintaining accountability for vast sums , they argued that at least some measure of assistance should be disbursed in this way . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Director [MISC Walters’  ] meetings with [ORG GOA  ] and international community officials highlighted the complexity of Afghanistan’s poppy dilemma . 
Little consensus exists on how to solve the problem: the [ORG GOA  ] wants time , more development assistance , and greater discretion on how to spend development funding ; [ORG ISAF  ] wants to see poppy elimination programs become more integrated with security strategy ; the [LOC UK  ] Embassy argues for incremental improvements within a broader capacity-building enterprise . 
These debates rage within a political environment where power is diffuse and [LOC Kabul  ] competes for regional and local influence with provincial offices and tribal structures . 
Every decision requires inordinate time and effort as we work to broker agreements between competing interests. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) In the background , the poppy continues to grow , and [MISC Walters’  ] aerial surveillance of rich poppy fields in [LOC Helmand  ] offered immediate and powerful visual evidence of the scope of the problem . 
The difficulties of eradicating poppy in the same area where complex [ORG ISAF  ] military operations are in full swing were also exposed . 
The long-term challenges are immense but should not overshadow the short-term necessity of political engagement , and Director [MISC Walters’  ] visit highlighted the great importance of making poppy elimination one of the [MISC GOA’s  ] central priorities . 
No one ministry can win this battle alone . 
It requires concerted government will , and President [PER Karzai  ] needs to take control of this effort and publicize its importance for all of [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Ambassador stressed this point during President Karzai’s counter-narcotics meeting on March 27 ( reftel ) . 
As of the first week in April , we are approaching the end game of this season , s eradication efforts in [LOC Helmand  ] and will soon be evaluating the campaign’s impact in the light of [MISC Walters’  ] observations during his recent visit . 
END COMMENT <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 .
