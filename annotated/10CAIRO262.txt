( [ORG SBU  ] ) Key [PER Points:  ] --The [ORG Ministry of Tourism  ] ( [ORG MoT  ] ) projects a 5-7% increase in tourism revenues and arrivals for 2010 over last year. --New growth opportunities are expected in [LOC Egypt  ] 's [MISC Mediterranean  ] north shore area and [ORG MoT  ] is overseeing plans to increase hotel capacity for the region . 
-- [ORG MoT  ] plans to pilot a zero emissions resort town in a bid to lure foreign tourists interested in environmental issues. --Over the last two years , [ORG MoT  ] has initiated comprehensive employee training programs in order to build a managerial workforce for the tourism industry. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) On January 27 , Econoff met with Senior Assistant Minister for Tourism [PER Hisham Zaazou  ] , a former tourism executive who serves as a key advisor to Minister [PER Mohamed Zoheir Garana  ] . 
He also oversees new initiatives such as " green tourism " and improved training programs. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) After a slight decline in 2009 attributed primarily to the global financial crisis , both tourism revenues and arrivals - two key industry benchmarks - are expected to increase on the order of 5-7%- for 2010 ( Ref A ) . 
According to the [ORG Ministry of Tourism  ] ( [ORG MoT  ] ) , [LOC Egypt  ] remains on track to reach its long-stated target of 14 million tourist visits annually by 2011 - a number set out in President [PER Mubarak  ] 's 2005 presidential campaign platform . 
[LOC Egypt  ] 's " national tourism plan " targets an annual level of more than 25 million tourists by 2020. -------------------- Growth Areas -------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Egypt  ] 's [LOC Red Sea  ] coastal region should remain the country 's most popular destination for foreign tourists but [PER Zaazou  ] advised that the [ORG MoT  ] is looking to the country 's [MISC Mediterranean  ] north coast as a key location for new growth opportunities . 
The area stretching westward from the city of [LOC El Alamein  ] ( 150 miles northwest of [LOC Cairo  ] ) to the summer resort town of [LOC Marsa Matrouh  ] , comprises approximately 300 miles of coastline . 
[ORG MoT  ] is working with real estate developers to triple the number of available hotel rooms in the area , from 7,000 to more than 22,000 in the next 5-10 years . 
The focus , [PER Zaazou  ] stated , will be on luring [MISC European  ] tourists - who make up more than 70% of [LOC Egypt  ] 's foreign tourist market . 
The government is currently upgrading four airports in the north shore area ( [LOC Alexandria  ] , [LOC Marsa Matrouh  ] , [LOC El-Alamein  ] , and [PER Borg El Arab  ] ) with an eye towards eventually allowing low-cost [MISC European  ] airlines to service the area and bypass [LOC Cairo.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) This potential new growth is crucial to [ORG MoT  ] 's plan to generate new jobs in the tourism sector . 
[PER Zaazou  ] noted that for every 1 million new tourism visitors , [LOC Egypt  ] generates 200,000 new jobs - listing hotels and tourism companies as the most obvious recipients but also pointing out the rise in demand for skilled tradesmen such as electricians , plumbers , and carpenters . 
He explained that government economic plans call for the creation of 600,000 new jobs annually . 
If growth continues as expected , tourism could provide one-third of new employment . 
" The tourism industry should be the main driving force for the economy , " [PER Zaazou  ] said. --------------------------------------------- Piloting [ORG Zero Emission Tourism  ] --------------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG MoT  ] plans to introduce what it labels " zero emission tourism " in highly visited tourist destinations , starting with the [MISC Sinai  ] city of [LOC Sharm  ] el-Sheikh . 
[PER Zaazou  ] asserted that [ORG MoT  ] will seek to lower carbon emission by 90% in [LOC Sharm  ] el-Sheikh by 2020 by improving water conservation and sanitary systems , increasing dependency on renewable energy sources , and upgrading the city 's public transportation system . 
By 2030 , [ORG MoT  ] predicts that [LOC Sharm  ] el-Sheikh will become a zero emissions resort area . 
[PER Zaazou  ] explained [LOC Egypt  ] is seeking an advantage over its [MISC Mediterranean  ] neighbors ( notably [LOC Turkey  ] ) and a future emphasis towards " green environment tourism " may provide that edge . 
If [ORG MoT  ] is successful with the [LOC Sharm  ] el-Sheikh project , [PER Zaazou  ] indicated that [LOC Egypt  ] will expand the program to other areas along the [LOC Red Sea  ] coastal area but did not identify any specific locations. ----------------------------------------- Employee Training is Pivotal ----------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In the last two years , [ORG MoT  ] has begun comprehensive training for current tourism employees as well as youth seeking employment in the industry . 
Led by the [ORG Ministry-controlled Higher Council for Tourism  ] , the program has initially targeted popular resort areas along the [LOC Red Sea Coastal  ] area and will train rank and file employees as well as middle and senior managers - primarily for private [MISC Egyptian  ] hotels . 
[ORG MoT  ] is not working with foreign hotels since they maintain their own training programs . 
[PER Zaazou  ] said the goal is to build an [MISC Egyptian  ] managerial class that currently lacks sufficient numbers . 
[PER Zaazou  ] also couched the need for training as a " social impact force . 
" [LOC Egypt  ] has problems with people holding " radical [MISC Islamist  ] views , " he confided . 
Employee training problems present the opportunity to moderate these views , noting that " exposure to new ideas and education " will allow for improved social interactions between [MISC Egyptians  ] and foreigners . 
( Note: According to press accounts , Minister [PER Garana  ] reaffirmed this training commitment at a [ORG World Tourism Organization  ] meeting in [LOC Spain  ] on February 1 , 2010 where he pledged to upgrade national employee training programs . 
End Note ) <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: [ORG MoT  ] 's projections for tourism arrivals , revenues , and job creation appear overly optimistic given the difficulties faced by the global tourism market . 
The intense pace of infrastructure development - especially in the country 's north shore - is a major concern if tourism visits do not increase according to [ORG MoT  ] 's stated 2020 goal . 
However , the key element in [PER Zaazou  ] 's overview of [ORG MoT  ] 's plans is a newfound commitment to training , a surprising yet welcome development . 
Contacts in nearly all of the government 's ministries repeatedly discuss [LOC Egypt  ] 's desperate need for a skilled managerial class . 
If [ORG MoT  ] is to meet its ambitious targets , it is critical that it develops a well-trained tourism workforce to convince the foreign tourist market to regularly return to [LOC Egypt  ] .
