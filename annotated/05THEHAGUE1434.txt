Classified By: AMBASSADOR CLIFFORD SOBEL FOR REASONS 1.4 ( B ) AND ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: With polls showing a clear majority opposed to ratifying the [ORG EU  ] Constitutional [PER Treaty  ] , the [MISC Dutch  ] government is belatedly stepping up its efforts to obtain a " " Yes " " vote in the June 1 referendum . 
At the same time , Prime Minister [PER Balkenende  ] is actively distancing his government from the results of the referendum and seeking to shift responsibility for dealing with a defeat to [ORG Parliament  ] . 
Opponents and supporters of the [ORG Treaty  ] agree that voter dissatisfaction with the [MISC Dutch  ] and [MISC European  ] political establishment is a major motivation for " " No " " voters . 
Both sides concede that a " " Yes " " vote is not completely out of the question , and at least one recent poll suggests that the tide might be starting to turn , but there is very little time to turn the electorate around . 
The [PER Balkenende  ] government will almost certainly survive a negative outcome , but such a public defeat will provide a clear boost to populist/nationalist politicians hoping to capitalize on public discontent in the runup to parliamentary elections scheduled for 2007 . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) With all recent polls showing the " " No " " camp likely to prevail -- possibly by 60 percent or more -- in the June 1 referendum on the [ORG EU  ] 's Constitutional [ORG Treaty  ] , the [MISC Dutch  ] government is stepping up its " " Yes " " campaign while seeking to minimize the political consequences of a defeat . 
In several recent interviews , [MISC Dutch  ] Prime Minister [PER Balkenende  ] reminded voters that the referendum was a parliamentary initiative initially opposed by the two largest members of his coalition government ; a vote against the referendum , therefore , would not be taken as a vote of no-confidence in his government . 
Some observers give [PER Balkenende  ] credit for at least making an effort in support of the [ORG Treaty  ] despite his skepticism about the referendum while the main opposition Labor Party/PvdA , which was largely responsible for pushing the referendum legislation through parliament , has been missing in action . 
Far more , however , blame [PER Balkenende  ] and his government for incompetently managing the issue from the beginning . 
[PER Geert Wilders  ] , the maverick [MISC Dutch  ] populist politician who has become one of the most visible leaders of the " " No " " campaign , told [ORG POLCOUNS  ] on May 24 that the government 's missteps had probably done more to boost the " " No " " vote than any efforts by opponents of the treaty . 
WHY VOTE NO ? 
BECAUSE WE CAN. ----------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Both camps agree that many " " No " " voters are basing their decision on factors unrelated to the [ORG Treaty  ] itself . 
Frustration with [PER Balkenende  ] ( whose personal popularity ratings are at an all time low , hovering around 16 percent ) and anger at a perceived [MISC Dutch-European  ] political elite that pays little attention to the concerns of common citizens are clearly fueling the " " No " " movement . 
A group of students from [ORG Leiden University  ] told the DCM on May 18 that they intended to vote against the [ORG Treaty  ] precisely because [PER Balkenende  ] was " " telling them to vote for it . 
" " Strong supporters of the treaty such as [PER Lousewies van der Laan  ] ( foreign policy spokesman for the [ORG Liberal Democrat/D-66  ] party ) and [PER Jan Gooijenbier  ] ( a public relations/marketing expert brought in to head the government 's [ORG Referendum Task Force  ] ) admitted in recent meetings with [ORG POLCOUNS  ] that overcoming the public 's lack of confidence in the current [MISC Dutch  ] leadership and [ORG EU  ] institutions has been the hardest hurdle for the " " Yes " " camp to overcome . 
During his current bus " " tourNEE " " of the [LOC Netherlands  ] , [PER Wilders  ] claimed to have been surprised by the " " level of hate " " routinely expressed for [PER Balkenende  ] 's government , and agreed that for many the vote would be " " all about a lack of trust . 
" " The " " No " " campaign also draws strength from an eclectic mix of parties on the left ( [ORG Socialist Party  ] ) and right ( including the two small [MISC Christian  ] parties ) worried that a strengthened [ORG EU  ] will reduce their ability to influence domestic politics , as well as a host of single-issue voters opposed to [MISC Turkish  ] accession , increased immigration , and expansion of the [MISC EURO  ] zone among other issues. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The fact that this will be the first national referendum in modern [MISC Dutch  ] history , and that it is technically non-binding , has also played strongly into the hands of the " " No " " camp . 
According to [PER Gooijenbier  ] , the government 's own polls suggest that many voters see the current referendum as an opportunity to vent retroactively on earlier decisions made without their input , such as switching from the guilder to the [LOC EURO  ] ( a move many blame for subsequent inflation ) and [ORG EU  ] expansion ( including possibly to [LOC Turkey  ] ) . 
The polls also show that most voters believe that their vote in a non-binding referendum will not be taken seriously , and therefore feel comfortable casting " " protest " " vote without regard to consequences . 
( [PER Note: Although  ] the referendum is legally non-binding , most political parties have announced formula under which they would " " accept " " the results ; the [MISC Christian Democrats  ] , for example , insist on a 30 percent turnout with 60 percent opposed ; others , such as the [MISC Liberal Democrats  ] ( pro ) and Socialists ( con ) will accept any result regardless of turnout or margin of victory . 
) Recent statements by opposition leader [PER Wouter Bos  ] suggesting that a " " No " " vote could lead to a second referendum were quickly seized upon as further evidence that the political establishment will ignore the people 's will if faced with a negative vote . 
Foreign Minister Bot 's suggestion in parliament on May 23 that those wavering about the [ORG Treaty  ] should stay home rather than vote no further reinforced the view that the government just doesn't " " get it . 
" " OVERSOLD AND UNDERWHELMED ------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The " " Yes " " camp has been plagued from the beginning by disagreements over strategy and message . 
While some advised minimizing the impact of a negative outcome by seeking to reduce turnout ( ref a ) , others -- including Justice Minister [PER Donner  ] and [ORG Economic Affairs Minister/Deputy  ] Prime Minister [PER Brinkhorst  ] -- engaged in scare tactics , suggesting that a " " no " " vote could return [LOC Europe  ] to an era of chaos and war no seen in the past 60 years . 
Not surprisingly , the public reacted negatively to both tactics . 
The media and public have also been quick to point out apparent divisions within the cabinet , as when Finance Minister/Deputy Prime Minister [PER Zalm  ] reportedly refused to join the rest of the Cabinet in personally handing out pro-treaty leaflets outside the Prime Minister 's office . 
( [PER Balkenende  ] recently began hosting daily strategy sessions with key cabinet officials , including Bot , [PER Zalm  ] , [PER Brinkhorst  ] , and State Secretary for Foreign Affairs [PER Atzo Nicolai  ] to ensure all agree on a single , coordinated message . 
) Even more damaging has been the failure of the government and the opposition [ORG PvdA  ] party to develop a coordinated strategy in favor of the [MISC Treaty  ] . 
During a recent meeting with Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] and [ORG POLCOUNS  ] , [PER Wouter Bos  ] openly admitted that he found it distasteful to be seen cooperating with the government as the head of the opposition , even though a vote against the treaty would essentially harm both as members of the political " " establishment . 
" " <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The government was restrained from campaigning aggressively in favor of the [MISC Treaty  ] both by [MISC Dutch  ] tradition and by the referendum legislation , which tasked the government with administering the referendum in a neutral fashion . 
As noted ref. a , the " " revelation " " that the government had established a contingency fund of 1.5 million [MISC Euros  ] to counter negative campaigning triggered a mini-scandal in parliament . 
The government 's over-reliance on " " information " " -- its first pro-Treaty hand-out consisted entirely of excerpts from the [MISC Treaty  ] text -- and speeches by government officials to pitch the treaty backfired , with voters reacting indifferently to the first and negatively to the second . 
[PER Farah Karimi  ] , a [MISC Green-Left  ] member of parliament and one of the three original sponsors of the referendum legislation , told [ORG POLCOUNS  ] on May 26 that most members of parliament " " never dreamed " " that the [MISC Dutch  ] public would reject the treaty , so did not make any provisions for a " " pro " " campaign . 
THE [MISC FRENCH  ] CONNECTION --------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) All parties agree that the results of the May 29 referendum in [LOC France  ] will influence the [MISC Dutch  ] vote , but opinions vary on exactly how . 
[PER Arno Brouwers  ] , a journalist for [ORG Volkskrant  ] , jokingly told [ORG POLCOUNS  ] that a [MISC French  ] " " Non " " could be the only thing that would convince the [MISC Dutch  ] to vote " " [ORG Ja  ] , " " as it would give [MISC Dutch  ] voters a new target for expressing their frustration . 
[PER Geert Wilders  ] similarly suggested that some " " no " " voters might reconsider their view of the [MISC Treaty  ] if the [MISC French  ] reject it , reflecting the commonly-held view that what is good for [LOC France  ] in the [ORG EU  ] is generally bad for the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
A more likely scenario , however , is that a negative result in [LOC France  ] would convince many voters to remain home on June 1 , lowering overall turnout but probably raising the " " no " " percentage . 
According to [PER Gooijenbier  ] , the government has developed two campaigns to follow the [MISC French  ] vote referendum . 
If the vote is positive , the government will stress that " " 280 million [MISC Europeans  ] are already in favor of the [MISC Treaty  ] ; " " if not , then the theme will be along the lines of: " " Don't let the [MISC French  ] tell you how to vote . 
" " According to the [MISC British  ] Embassy , Prime Minister [PER Balkenende  ] has also quietly asked Prime Minister [PER Blair  ] to weigh in with [MISC Dutch  ] voters following the [MISC French  ] vote , either by traveling to the [LOC Netherlands  ] ( doubtful , according to the [LOC UK  ] Embassy ) or by recording a direct appeal for broadcast . 
The option of canceling the [MISC Dutch  ] referendum is not on the table . 
ENOUGH TIME TO TURN THE TIDE ? ----------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Despite most polls showing a growing a clear majority opposing the treaty , both camps are stepping up their campaigns in the final days before the referendum . 
The government , having recently defeated a court action intended to prevent it from spending additional funds on the " " Yes " " campaign , has just budgeted an additional 7 million [MISC Euros  ] for an intense pro-Treaty print and radio advertising blitz , according to [PER Gooijenbier  ] . 
( [PER Gooijenbier  ] noted that he had also proposed television advertising , but that the Cabinet decided engaging in " " partisan " " television advertising was " " a bridge too far . 
" " ) Familiar national figures , including all four living former Prime Ministers , have started to campaign actively in favor of the [MISC Treaty  ] . 
[PER Gooijenbier  ] cited a May 23 poll showing a slight decrease in the number of " " No " " voters ( from 60 percent to 57 percent ) and increase in " " Yes " " voters ( from 40 percent to 43 percent ) although they still constituted a majority ) as evidence that [MISC Dutch  ] voters might be starting to " " wake up and pay attention " " to the possible consequences of a negative vote . 
[PER Van der Laan  ] , who last week predicted a " " colossal no " " in a press interview , privately suggested that the government might just barely pull " " a rabbit out of a hat " " but was not optimistic . 
[PER Wilders  ] also conceded that a dramatic turnaround in voter sentiment was not out of the question , and put the chances of a " " Yes " " vote at about 20 percent . 
THE DAY AFTER ------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Partly to convince voters to take the referendum seriously , the government has deliberately refrained from engaging in debate over what would happen in case of a " " No " " vote , and in fact appears to have no " " [MISC Plan B  ] . 
" " [ORG Parliament  ] will almost certainly insist on a debate on the [MISC Treaty  ] -- which is already in [ORG Parliament  ] and should be ratified before November 2006 -- within days of the referendum , regardless of the outcome . 
If there is a negative result , the government will probably argue that it has done its duty and any further steps are the responsibility of [ORG Parliament  ] , which forced the referendum on the government in the first place . 
[PER Balkenende  ] has stated for the record that he and his government will not resign in the event of a negative result , although some observers speculate privately that State Secretary for Foreign Affairs [PER Atzo Nicolai  ] , as the Cabinet member directly responsible for [MISC European  ] integration issues , might choose to leave the government . 
A [PER Nicolai  ] resignation would probably not bring down the government , however , as under the coalition agreement his party ( [ORG Conservative Liberal/VVD  ] ) could replace him from its ranks . 
Unless turnout is so small as to be absolutely meaningless , any effort to proceed with ratification following a " " No " " vote would provoke a more serious political crisis , as coalition partner the [ORG Liberal Democrats/D-66  ] is on the record refusing to accede to such a plan . 
Most likely , the government and parliament will decide to delay definitive action for some period of time to see how the [MISC Treaty  ] is received in other [MISC European  ] countries holding referenda . 
COMMENT: ------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) On paper , the pro-Treaty coalition is impressive: 85 percent of parliamentarians , all major unions and employer associations , most major media , and many notable public figures have come out in favor of the [MISC Treaty  ] . 
The fact that these traditional sources of influence have failed to produce a positive majority is viewed by many as proof that the populist " " revolution " " against the traditional political elite begun by [PER Pim Fortuyn  ] continues to be a major factor in [MISC Dutch  ] politics . 
While a " " Yes " " vote is not impossible , there is very little time left to turn around a deeply skeptical and angry electorate , and the government has so far shown little skill in guiding public opinion effectively . 
There is little question that [PER Balkenende  ] 's coalition government will survive a " " No " " vote in the short term , as all three partners are down in the polls and desperate to avoid early elections . 
That said , a highly visible defeat in the referendum would clearly undermine [PER Balkenende  ] 's standing among his [MISC European  ] colleagues and would heighten the domestic perception of him as a weak and ineffectual leader . 
Although the [MISC Labor Party/PvdA  ] , as the main opposition party in [ORG Parliament  ] , might gain a few poll points at [PER Balkenende  ] 's expense , the real winners are likely to be populist , nationalist figures like [PER Geert Wilders  ] , who will seek to transfer the anti-establishment , anti-EU votes into a real political force prior to the 2007 elections .
