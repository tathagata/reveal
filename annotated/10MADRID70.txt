( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG The European Commission  ] will limit [LOC Spain  ] 's banking sector restructuring fund ( [ORG FROB  ] ) to loans of no more than 2% of 'risk-weighted assets' to distressed banks and savings banks , or 2% of their " determined minimum amount of capital to operate effectively . 
" The [ORG EC  ] made this announcement after the [MISC Spanish  ] government said the [ORG FROB  ] would be allowed to loan up to 2.5% . 
The [ORG EC  ] will make a final decision on approval before February 9 . 
The expected approval will allow the [ORG GOS  ] the ability to use the [ORG FROB  ] without case-by-case authorization from [LOC Brussels  ] , ultimately speeding up the banking sector restructuring process . 
The [ORG FROB  ] has 9 billion euros and the ability to borrow up to 10 times that amount , for a total of 99 billion euros available . 
( [ORG El Pais  ] , 1/19 and 1/22 ) [ORG Competition Commission Accuses Copyright Management Entities of Monopolistic Practices  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [ORG National Competition Commission  ] ( [ORG CNC  ] ) issued a 100-page report accusing [LOC Spain  ] 's copyright management entities ( collecting societies ) of monopolistic practices in representing the interests of artists and entertainers and collecting royalties . 
In response , the largest and best-known of the management entities , the [ORG General Society of Authors and Publishers  ] ( [ORG SGAE  ] ) , joined forces with three smaller groups to form a new group , 'Ibercrea' ( [ORG Iberian Creators  ] ) , to defend their interests collectively . 
The [ORG CNC  ] report represents a new conflict between the [ORG GOS  ] and the members of [LOC Ibercrea  ] , who support the government 's controversial legislative proposal to combat internet piracy of copyrighted works . 
Separately , two outspoken [MISC Spanish  ] attorneys known for their support of free downloading , [PER Javier de la Cueva  ] and [PER David Bravo  ] , presented the report to the [ORG European Court of Justice  ] , claiming that [LOC Spain  ] is in violation of the [ORG EU  ] 's anti-trust laws by allowing the copyright entities to operate . 
Comment: The management entities , especially [ORG SGAE  ] , are unpopular in [LOC Spain  ] due to their support for the " digital canon " private copy levy . 
[ORG SGAE  ] in particular suffers from a bad public image resulting from its aggressive practices in collecting royalties . 
The current anti-trust accusations , combined with demonstrations by employees over working conditions and pay , only add to [ORG SGAE  ] 's woes . 
( [ORG El Pais  ] , 1/21 and 1/22 ) [ORG Online Piracy Blamed for Drop in Music Sales  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [ORG International Federation of the Phonographic Industry  ] ( [ORG IFPI  ] ) recorded a worldwide drop of 30% in sales over the past five years , while [MISC Spanish  ] artists have seen sales fall by 65% . 
Overall sales in [LOC Spain  ] fell 17% in the past year alone . 
Industry representatives cited frustration over what they described as the [MISC GOS'  ] passivity in fighting piracy . 
However , the head of the [ORG IFPI  ] 's local branch , Promusicae , expressed hope that the [ORG GOS  ] would " continue the process it has just started , " referring to the controversial " anti-downloading " provisions in the government 's draft [ORG Economic Sustainability Law  ] .
