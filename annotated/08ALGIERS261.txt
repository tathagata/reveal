Ford  ] ; reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) SUMMARY: In February 26 and 27 meetings with [ORG NEA  ] Assistant Secretary [PER C. David Welch  ] , President [PER Abdelaziz Bouteflika  ] and Prime Minister [PER Abdelaziz Belkhadem  ] emphasized their familiar line on self-determination for [LOC Western Sahara  ] , as well as the need to find a way out that would allow [LOC Algeria  ] to " save face . 
" [PER Bouteflika  ] said that relations with [LOC Morocco  ] were " brotherly " and that [LOC Western Sahara  ] was the only issue standing between them . 
Because the [LOC U.S.  ] was unburdened by the colonial past of [LOC France  ] in the region , [PER Bouteflika  ] felt it was ideally placed to serve as an informal referee in resolving the dispute . 
Although he said he understood [LOC Morocco  ] felt threatened by the prospect of [ORG Western Saharan  ] independence , [PER Bouteflika  ] said that [LOC Morocco  ] only had itself to blame for the current situation , as it had proceeded in a " clumsy " manner . 
With a more " elegant " touch , he said , [LOC Morocco  ] could have encouraged " a [LOC Puerto Rico  ] " outcome , where [MISC Sahrawis  ] would happily choose to remain a part of [LOC Morocco  ] in some form . 
[PER Welch  ] underlined to the [MISC Algerian  ] officials that the [LOC U.S.  ] sought a practical approach that could help the current negotiations make progress , and the [MISC Moroccan  ] autonomy proposal offered such a possibility . 
END SUMMARY . 
LOVE FOR [PER BAKER  ] PLAN DIES HARD ----------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) In response to [ORG A/S Welch  ] 's assertion that the [MISC Moroccan  ] plan served to move a frozen situation forward in the absence of any alternative , [PER Bouteflika  ] asserted that the plan of former Secretary of State [PER James Baker  ] was such an alternative . 
He told [ORG A/S Welch  ] that if another option was necessary , " self-determination is that alternative " and the [PER Baker  ] Plan should be discussed . 
[ORG A/S Welch  ] replied that the [PER Baker  ] plan is dead because it , too , failed to generate progress . 
In [PER Bouteflika  ] 's view , [PER Baker  ] failed because it was not given a chance , and he blamed the [LOC U.S.  ] for " not taking its [ORG UN Security Council  ] responsibilities seriously . 
" [PER Bouteflika  ] said the [MISC Moroccan  ] plan offered less autonomy for [LOC Western Sahara  ] than an [MISC Algerian  ] province currently enjoys ( reftel ) . 
He conceded that [LOC Algeria  ] does have influence in [LOC Western Sahara  ] , but swore he would not use it to violate what he sees as international law . 
[MISC MOROCCAN  ] " CLUMSINESS " TO BLAME ------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) Prime Minister [PER Abdelaziz Belkhadem  ] told [ORG A/S Welch  ] on February 26 that the stability of [LOC Morocco  ] was in [LOC Algeria  ] 's interest , and that attempting " to transform an anti-colonial issue " was not the right path to take and was potentially destabilizing to the region . 
[PER Bouteflika  ] , meanwhile , said that he understood [LOC Morocco  ] felt threatened by the prospect of independence for [LOC Western Sahara  ] , but stressed that the [MISC Moroccans  ] only had themselves to blame for current [MISC Sahrawi  ] determination . 
[PER Bouteflika  ] explained , saying that [LOC Morocco  ] could have easily used a more " elegant " approach to produce a [LOC Western Sahara  ] independence that could be controlled or supervised . 
Instead , he said , " they want [ORG Anschluss  ] like [PER Saddam Hussein  ] with [LOC Kuwait  ] . 
" [PER Bouteflika  ] said he easily could have imagined an outcome in which [LOC Western Sahara  ] chose to remain a part of [LOC Morocco  ] after seeing the benefits of [MISC Moroccan  ] rule , in much the same way " as [LOC Puerto Rico  ] chose to remain part of the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" According to [PER Bouteflika  ] , [LOC Morocco  ] needs to offer the [ORG Polisario  ] something , since " you cannot ask concessions from people who have nothing in their pockets . 
" Had it not been for [LOC Morocco  ] 's " clumsy " approach , [PER Bouteflika  ] said " they could have gotten what they wanted . 
" ON [LOC FRANCE  ] AND [LOC U.S.  ] ------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) Burdened by its colonial history in the [LOC Maghreb  ] , [LOC France  ] is unable to play a constructive role in resolving the [LOC Western Sahara  ] dispute , according to [PER Bouteflika  ] . 
[LOC France  ] " has never really accepted [MISC Algerian  ] independence , " [PER Bouteflika  ] said , and he claimed that [LOC France  ] was trying to settle scores with [LOC Algeria  ] by interfering in [LOC Western Sahara  ] in support of [LOC Morocco  ] . 
In contrast , [PER Bouteflika  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] was an ideal counterweight to balance [LOC Morocco  ] , as none of the parties ALGIERS 00000261 002 OF 002 involved had any bone of contention with the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Bouteflika  ] complained that the [LOC U.S.  ] treats [LOC Algeria  ] as " second class " compared to the preferential treatment it gives to [LOC Tunisia  ] and [LOC Morocco  ] . 
He said the [LOC U.S.  ] should understand [LOC Algeria  ] better , as " you also paid a price for your independence . 
" [PER Belkhadem  ] told [ORG A/S Welch of Algeria  ] 's admiration for [LOC U.S.  ] positions on the independence of [LOC East Timor  ] and [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
" Why don't you share the same views on [LOC Western Sahara  ] ? 
" asked [PER Belkhadem  ] , " it leaves us wondering what our [LOC U.S.  ] friends want . 
" With both [MISC Algerians  ] , [PER A/S Welch  ] underlined that the [LOC U.S.  ] sought practical approaches that would advance the [LOC Western Sahara  ] negotiations forward . 
The [MISC Moroccan  ] proposal , he noted , offered a possibility . 
He urged the [MISC Algerians  ] to consider what they could do to help the current negotiations make concrete progress . 
COMMENT: NEED TO SAVE FACE -------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) [PER Bouteflika  ] repeated to [PER A/S Welch  ] several times the need for [LOC Algeria  ] to get itself out of the [LOC Western Sahara  ] dispute in a way that allowed it to " save face . 
" He reiterated that [LOC Algeria  ] " has no claim " at stake , and spoke of looking towards positive future relations with [LOC Morocco  ] , as " one day we will need to get beyond this . 
" In a February 27 meeting with Foreign Minister [PER Mourad Medelci  ] , [PER A/S Welch  ] invited the [MISC Algerian  ] delegation to visit [LOC Washington  ] immediately following the next round of negotiations at [LOC Manhasset  ] , to continue the discussions. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 .
