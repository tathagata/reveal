TALKING POINTS/NON-PAPER ------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S//REL China  ] ) [PER Begin  ] talking points/non-paper: -- We would like to share with you information regarding a transfer of maraging steel from the [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
-- Our information indicates that [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] XXXXXXXXXXXX [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] -- The purchase was to consist of approximately 25 metric tons of maraging steel , which was to be machined so as to be disguised as mechanical parts in order to evade [MISC Chinese  ] customs . 
-- The pro forma invoice for this shipment includes the following details: --- Commodity: maraging steel rods , diameter: 38.1 mm , length: 450.2 mm --- Technical Standards/Specifications/Requirements: According to grade DIN . 
1.270 ( X3NiCoMoTi18-9-5 ) or [ORG AISI  ] 18 Ni --- [PER Packing:  ] in seaworthy standard wooden boxes --- Price: free on Board ( [ORG FOB  ] ) [MISC Chinese  ] main port: 58.85 euro ( $75.47 ) PER KG , Cost and Freight ( [ORG CFR  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX:  ] 59 euro ( $75.55 ) per kg --- Partial shipment allowed , transshipment not allowed --- Shipment: By vessel in container --- Payment: 50 percent by telegraphic transfer prepaid and remaining 50 percent by cash at delivery , to be paid after the cargo has been received and the quality and quantity confirmed. --- Delivery time: within 80-140 days from the date of receipt of 50 percent prepaid payment --- Port of loading: any [MISC Chinese  ] port --- [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] We believe that other deals are also being discussed between these parties , possibly involving other forms of maraging steel . 
-- Certain types of maraging steel are subject to control by the [ORG Nuclear Suppliers  ] , Group Dual Use List , under item 2 . 
[PER C.  ] 11 , and by the [ORG Missile Technology Control Regime  ] under item 6C8 of [ORG Category II  ] .

-- Although the solid maraging steel rods described previously are not explicitly controlled on these lists , the circumstances surrounding this case , i.e. , deceptive practices involving a proscribed entity and prospects for further deals between the parties , suggest that the transfer of this material would be inconsistent with [MISC China’s  ] obligations under [ORG UNSCR  ] 1737 . 
-- Moreover , certain types of maraging steel are prohibited by [ORG UNSCR  ] 1803 from being transferred to [LOC Iran  ] . 
-- As you are aware , we have discussed the proliferation related activities of [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] with the [MISC Chinese  ] Government on a number of occasions .
