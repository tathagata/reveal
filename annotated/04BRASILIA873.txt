( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY . 
After months of relative quiet , [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Landless Movement  ] ( [ORG MST  ] ) has initiated a wave of land occupations timed to coincide with the anniversary of a 1996 massacre . 
Many occupations are in the northeastern state of [LOC Pernambuco  ] , where other groups besides [ORG MST  ] are active . 
In [LOC Bahia  ] , the invasion of a cellulose plantation pits the administration 's populist impulses against its need to protect agribusiness investments . 
[ORG MST  ] 's best known leader called for a " Red April " of actions , but later toned down his rhetoric , saying [ORG MST  ] is not trying to undermine the government but is impatient with slow progress on the [ORG National Agrarian Reform Plan  ] . 
The government has now authorized [MISC R$1.7  ] billion ( about [MISC US$570  ] million ) to get the [ORG National Plan  ] back on track , but it is not clear if or when the money will actually be made available . 
[ORG MST  ] 's high-profile activities attract great attention but at present are neither as numerous nor as violent as in the late 1990s . 
With the [PER Lula  ] administration torn between its support for agrarian reform and its responsibilities to agribusiness , public security , and fiscal austerity , there may be some modest progress made , but [ORG MST  ] will not reduce its pressure . 
END SUMMARY . 
APRIL OCCUPATIONS BECOMING AN ANNUAL RITE ----------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On April 17 , 1996 , nineteen landless activists were killed by police in the town of [LOC Eldorado  ] do Carajas in the northern [MISC Brazilian  ] state of [LOC Para  ] . 
( N.b. , only two of 145 defendants were ever convicted , and they remain free on appeal . 
) The massacre gained international attention and was a watershed for the [ORG Landless Rural Workers' Movement  ] ( [ORG MST  ] ) , radicalizing it further and turning it against the [ORG Cardoso  ] government . 
[ORG MST  ] , established in 1984 , is [LOC Brazil  ] 's primary agitator for agrarian reform ( refs A , B ) . 
Its demands are built around the proven tactic of occupation of farmland by hundreds of landless families until the government cedes title . 
In its early years , [ORG MST  ] typically occupied lands that were unproductive or where title was in doubt , but after the 1996 massacre , the movement became far more belligerent and just as likely to invade government buildings , productive farms , or land owned by multinationals in order to score political points. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In recent years , [ORG MST  ] has organized growing waves of occupations and demonstrations in late-March/early-April to coincide with the anniversary of the 1996 massacre . 
Since mid-March , [ORG MST  ] and other groups have carried out a coordinated campaign of at least 53 land invasions ( the number grows daily ) in fourteen states involving 15,000 landless families , plus road blockades and demonstrations . 
Much of the activity is in the northeastern state of [LOC Pernambuco  ] , where many of the 25 reported occupations are led not by [ORG MST  ] but by [ORG FETAPE  ] ( " [LOC Pernambuco State Agricultural Workers' Federation  ] " ) , a rival organization that has tactical and ideological differences with [ORG MST  ] . 
[LOC PERNAMBUCO  ] - LATEST HOTBED OF OCCUPATIONS ----------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG FETAPE  ] has organized a reported 19 occupations in [LOC Pernambuco  ] in recent weeks --it claims to have mobilized 1,900 families-- but is careful to set up its camps outside target plantations to avoid running afoul of [ORG MP  ] 2183 . 
This Presidential [PER Decree  ] , issued by a frustrated President [ORG Cardoso  ] in May 2000 and still in force , bars for two years the government from expropriating and redistributing lands that are illegally occupied . 
The Decree sharply reduced land invasions , forcing activists to develop alternatives --such as setting up camps along roadsides or at plantation gates , or occupying government offices . 
[ORG FETAPE  ] President [PER Aristides  ] dos [PER Santos  ] says his organization now has a total of 153 camps in [LOC Pernambuco  ] comprising 9,400 families , but because of [ORG MP  ] 2183 , it has not occupied any of the 95 unproductive farms that it is pressing the state to expropriate. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG MST  ] 's leader in [LOC Pernambuco  ] , [PER Jaime Amorim  ] , has no such compunctions . 
[ORG MST  ] has occupied six farms this month , essentially taking them off the table for redistribution for two years . 
[ORG MST  ] may be particularly radicalized in [LOC Pernambuco  ] precisely because of intense competition from other activist groups . 
Not only [ORG FETAPE  ] , but also [ORG MAST  ] , [ORG MLST  ] , [ORG MPA  ] , [ORG MTBST  ] , [ORG MTB  ] , [ORG MTL  ] , [ORG MTR  ] , [ORG MTRUB  ] , [ORG OLC  ] , [ORG UAPE  ] , and [ORG COOPTERRA  ] are active , to greater or lesser degrees . 
[ORG OLC  ] ( " Organization for Struggle in the Fields " ) , for example , is more likely to occupy productive large-scale farms . 
[PER Amorim  ] blames the government for [LOC Pernambuco  ] troubles , saying " [ORG INCRA  ] ( the [ORG GoB  ] 's agrarian reform agency ) did not expropriate either occupied or unoccupied areas " . 
[ORG INCRA  ] 's state director [PER Joao Farias  ] ( himself a former [ORG MST  ] activist ) is more sympathetic to [ORG FETAPE  ] 's tactic of providing the state with lists of likely farms , rather than occupying them outright . 
[PER Farias  ] told us that the immediate situation is not as explosive as depicted in the press , but if unaddressed , [LOC Pernambuco  ] 's agrarian crisis is a " potential powder keg " . <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The land problem in [LOC Pernambuco  ] is rooted in its historical sugar economy that promoted the creation of enormous plantations worked by families of cane-cutters who subsisted on their own small plots . 
Since the 1980s , sugar mills have been failing , leaving an estimated 50,000 families with neither land nor steady wage employment . 
The result is a corps of hungry underemployed fieldworkers who have swelled the ranks of [ORG MST  ] and the other landless organizations . 
Worse , the [ORG GoB  ] 's [ORG INCRA  ] is chronically underfunded and has not resettled a single landless family in [LOC Pernambuco  ] in 2004 ( though its officials say it is processing sites that it hopes to redistribute later this year ) . 
[ORG INCRA  ] 's [PER Farias  ] told us that only 11,500 families have been resettled in [LOC Pernambuco  ] in the past forty years --perhaps 20% of the landless . 
[LOC BAHIA  ] - AGRIBUSINESS TRUMPS OCCUPATION -------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In what is reportedly the largest-ever land invasion in the state of [LOC Bahia  ] , on 4 April , 2,500 families organized by [ORG MST  ] seized a 53-acre plantation near [LOC Porto Seguro  ] , destroying eucalyptus trees ( a source of cellulose for paper products ) . 
The farm is owned by [ORG Veracel  ] ( a joint venture with a [MISC Swedish-Finnish  ] partner ) , and supplies the firm 's new nearby pulp mill , soon to be the world 's largest . 
Last year , [PER Lula  ] met with [ORG Veracel  ] officials to laud their decision to invest [MISC US$1.25  ] billion in the [LOC Bahia  ] operation --the largest single foreign investment during his administration . 
The [ORG GoB  ] condemned the [ORG Veracel  ] occupation , calling it bad for [LOC Brazil  ] and bad for business , adding that the government would never expropriate the site . 
On April 8 , [ORG MST  ] appeared ready to call off the invasion in return for an [ORG INCRA  ] pledge to speed redistribution of 12,000 acres already expropriated . 
[ORG MST  ] periodically seizes productive farms , particularly those owned by multinationals ( in 2003 it occupied several [ORG Monsanto  ] sites to protest the cultivation of biotech crops - ref D ) . 
[ORG NATIONAL PLAN  ] - LESS THAN HOPED ------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Lula  ] 's commitment to the landless dates to the early 1980s when the [ORG PT  ] party and [ORG MST  ] grew up together . 
During his 1994 presidential campaign he said , " With a single pen stroke , I'll give you so much land you won't be able to occupy it " . 
As President , he has learned that the problem is not so easily solved . 
In November 2003 , [PER Lula  ] unveiled his [ORG National Agrarian Reform Plan  ] ( ref C ) , pledging to resettle 400,000 landless families by the end of his term in December 2006 . 
The plan 's novelty was to link land distribution to measures making the farms viable , such as technical assistance , infrastructure , and credit . 
The [ORG National Plan  ] is good on paper but is far from being fulfilled . 
According to statistics released by the [ORG GoB  ] 's agrarian reform agency [ORG INCRA  ] , only 36,800 families were resettled in 2003 ( two-thirds of them in the [LOC Amazon  ] region ) . 
This left the administration far short of its goal of resettling 60,000 families in its first year and means that it will have to resettle 121,000 families in each of the next three years to reach the goal of 400,000 families . 
[ORG MST  ] LEADER'S RED HOT RHETORIC... -------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Joao Pedro Stedile  ] , [ORG MST  ] 's founder and best-known leader , often makes unhelpful comments ( last year he called for 'war on landowners' ) , announcing recently , " April will be a red month . 
We are going to make life hell . 
April will catch fire . 
" Listening to sharp criticism during a later congressional hearing , [PER Stedile  ] backtracked , saying he meant " to 'pester' the government not make its life hell " and that " Red April refers to our flags " . 
[ORG MST  ] , he said , " does not seek to destabilize the government but to spur debate " . 
He also apologized for a comment by fellow [ORG MST  ] leader [PER Jaime Amorim  ] that " for every one of us they kill , we'll kill ten . 
" [PER Stedile  ] noted that " it is stupid for us to use violence because we end up paying . 
The ones who die are on our side . 
" In an April 5 interview he explained that after the November 2003 announcement of the [ORG National Plan  ] , [ORG MST  ] did not halt its invasions because of any truce with the [ORG GoB  ] , but rather focused on ( non-invasion ) activities , such as organizing its base and developing its training programs . 
[ORG MST  ] , he said , ended 2003 with 200,000 families camped at 700 sites . 
True to form , he added , " The government should give signals that it is on the side of the poor against the rich " . 
He also listed [PER Lula  ] 's best ministers as ForMin [PER Celso Amorim  ] ( " has the courage to confront the gringos , wins 'Brazilian of the [MISC Year'  ] award " ) ; and Environment Minister [PER Marina Silva  ] ( " defends our people from [ORG Monsanto  ] and the handful of loggers who want to control the [LOC Amazon  ] " ) . 
AND THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE -------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On April 2 , [PER Lula  ] appeared to respond to [PER Stedile  ] 's " Red April " comments by announcing that [MISC R$1.7  ] billion ( about [MISC US$570  ] million ) would be allocated to the [ORG Ministry of Agrarian Development  ] to support the [ORG National Plan  ] . 
Denying that he was acting only because [ORG MST  ] was the squeaky wheel , he said , " [MISC Agrarian  ] reform is an issue of social justice , we will not be forced into it by the shouters " . 
[PER Lula  ] recommitted his government to fulfill the [ORG Plan  ] 's targets , and [ORG Agrarian Development  ] Minister [PER Rossetto  ] added that [PER Lula  ] had promised funding for 115,000 settlements in 2004. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG INCRA  ] 's Chief of Staff , [PER Viviane Coimbra  ] , told us that the [ORG National Plan  ] is sound and [ORG INCRA  ] can meet the resettlement goal " if we get the funding " . 
But she is not optimistic that even the 2004 money would be forthcoming in this tight fiscal environment . 
She does not believe the [ORG Plan  ] will be fulfilled . 
[PER Stedile  ] sounded a bit more charitable , saying , " The main thing about ( [PER Lula  ] 's ) announcement was not the amount of money , but the government 's declaration that resources will not be an obstacle to meeting the goal of 400,000 families . 
" Opposition Senator [PER Alvaro Dias  ] ( [ORG PSDB  ] ) , who chaired the hearing at which [PER Stedile  ] appeared , feels that the [MISC R$1.7  ] billion is not sufficient and that in any case [ORG INCRA  ] lacks structure and competence to carry out the [ORG Plan  ] , noting , " There is a large pocket of poverty in the countryside and social pressure will be even greater if the [ORG Plan  ] is not successful " . 
He pointed out that land occupations damage the agribusiness sector that accounted for 42% of [LOC Brazil  ] 's exports last year . 
COMMENT - [ORG BLOODY LAND DISPUTES HAVE BEEN BLOODIER  ] --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The bout of national angst sparked by [ORG MST  ] 's March/April invasions has become an annual event , generating attention for the landless and criticism from the press . 
But this year is running about the same as last year in terms of numbers of invasions and violence , and far below the peak 1998-1999 period , when memories of the 1996 massacre were fresh and [ORG MST  ] was in open conflict with the [ORG Cardoso  ] government . 
The following are [ORG GoB  ] statistics ( similar statistics compiled by the [MISC Catholic  ] Church 's [ORG Pastoral Land Commission  ] show the same trends but run higher in absolute numbers ) : YEAR: 1999 2002 2003 2004 TOTAL ANNUAL OCCUPATIONS: 502 183 202 OCCUPATIONS IN MARCH: 101 7 30 40 DEATHS IN AGRARIAN CONFLICTS: 101 20 42 2 <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Lula  ] 's competing impulses --defending agrarian reform while also supporting agribusiness , public security , and fiscal austerity-- will be on display in the coming weeks as [ORG MST  ] 's " Red April " reaches its climax . 
Expect continued hardline rhetoric from landless leaders , matched by lip service from administration officials on both sides of the issue . 
Some budget resources are likely to be freed for agrarian reform , though not enough to meet the [ORG National Plan  ] 's targets . 
On the other hand , [ORG MST  ] will offer no truce in its land invasions --it never does-- whether or not the government meets its demands. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 .
