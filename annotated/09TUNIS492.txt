Classified By: Ambassador [PER Robert F. Godec  ] for E.O. 12958 reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . ------- Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) By many measures , [LOC Tunisia  ] should be a close [LOC US  ] ally . 
But it is not . 
While we share some key values and the country has a strong record on development , [LOC Tunisia  ] has big problems . 
President [PER Ben Ali  ] is aging , his regime is sclerotic and there is no clear successor . 
Many [MISC Tunisians  ] are frustrated by the lack of political freedom and angered by [ORG First Family  ] corruption , high unemployment and regional inequities . 
Extremism poses a continuing threat . 
Compounding the problems , the [ORG GOT  ] brooks no advice or criticism , whether domestic or international . 
Instead , it seeks to impose ever greater control , often using the police . 
The result: [LOC Tunisia  ] is troubled and our relations are too. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) In the past three years , [ORG US Mission Tunis  ] has responded by offering greater cooperation where the [MISC Tunisians  ] say they want it , but not shied from making plain the need for change . 
We have had some successes , notably in the commercial and military assistance areas . 
But we have also had failures . 
We have been blocked , in part , by a [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] that seeks to control all our contacts in the government and many other organizations . 
Too often , the [ORG GOT  ] prefers the illusion of engagement to the hard work of real cooperation . 
Major change in [LOC Tunisia  ] will have to wait for [PER Ben Ali’s  ] departure , but President [PER Obama  ] and his policies create opportunities now . 
What should we do to take advantage of them ? 
We recommend:-- keep a strong focus on democratic reform and respect for human rights , but shift the way we promote these goals ; -- seek to engage the [ORG GOT  ] in a dialogue on issues of mutual interest , including trade and investment , [LOC Middle East  ] peace , and greater [LOC Maghreb  ] integration ; -- offer [MISC Tunisians  ] ( with an emphasis on youth ) more [MISC English-language  ] training , educational exchanges , and cultural programs ; -- move our military assistance away from [ORG FMF  ] , but look for new ways to build security and intelligence cooperation ; and , -- increase high-level contacts but stress that deeper [LOC US  ] cooperation depends on real [MISC Tunisian  ] engagement . 
End Summary. --------------------------------------------- ----- The [ORG Backdrop: Historic Relations and Shared Values  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Tunisia  ] have 200 years of close ties and common interests , including advancing regional peace , combating terrorism , and building prosperity . 
Since independence , [LOC Tunisia  ] deserves credit for its economic and social progress . 
Without the natural resources of its neighbors , [LOC Tunisia  ] focused on people and diversified its economy . 
In a success all too rare , the [ORG GOT  ] is effective in delivering services ( education , health care , infrastructure and security ) to its people . 
The [ORG GOT  ] has sought to build a &knowledge economy8 to attract FDI that will create high value-added jobs . 
As a result , the country has enjoyed five percent real GDP growth for the past decade . 
On women’s rights , [LOC Tunisia  ] is a model . 
And , [LOC Tunisia  ] has a long history of religious tolerance , as demonstrated by its treatment of its [MISC Jewish  ] community . 
While significant challenges remain ( above all the country’s 14 percent unemployment rate ) on balance [LOC Tunisia  ] has done better than most in the region. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On foreign policy , [LOC Tunisia  ] has long played a moderate role ( although recently its goal has been to &get along with everyone8 ) . 
The [ORG GOT  ] rejects the [ORG Arab League  ] boycott of [MISC Israeli  ] goods . 
Although it broke ties with [LOC Israel  ] in 2000 , the [ORG GOT  ] has from time to time taken part in quiet discussions with [MISC Israeli  ] officials . 
The [ORG GOT  ] also supports [PER Mahmoud Abbas’  ] leadership of the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] . 
[LOC Tunisia  ] participated in the [LOC Annapolis  ] conference and has supported our efforts to promote [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] negotiations . 
The [ORG GOT  ] is like-minded on [LOC Iran  ] , is an ally in the fight against terrorism , and has maintained an Embassy in [LOC Iraq  ] at the Charge level . 
Moreover , [LOC Tunisia  ] recently signed a debt forgiveness agreement with the GOI on [ORG Paris Club  ] terms ; it is the first [MISC Arab  ] country to do so. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Finally , although [MISC Tunisians  ] have been deeply angry over the war in [LOC Iraq  ] and perceived [LOC US  ] bias towards [LOC Israel  ] , most still admire the &the [MISC American  ] dream.8 Despite the anger at [LOC US  ] foreign policy , we see a growing desire for [MISC English-language  ] instruction , a wish for more educational and [LOC TUNIS  ] 00000492 002 OF 005 scientific exchanges , and a belief in the [MISC American  ] culture of innovation . 
[MISC Tunisians  ] see these as important for their future. --------------------------------------------- -------- The [MISC Problem: A Sclerotic Regime  ] and Growing Corruption --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Despite Tunisia’s economic and social progress , its record on political freedoms is poor . 
[LOC Tunisia  ] is a police state , with little freedom of expression or association , and serious human rights problems . 
The [ORG GOT  ] can point to some political progress in the last decade , including an end to prior review of books and [ORG ICRC  ] access to many prisons . 
But for every step forward there has been another back , for example the recent takeover of important private media outlets by individuals close to President [PER Ben Ali.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The problem is clear: [LOC Tunisia  ] has been ruled by the same president for 22 years . 
He has no successor . 
And , while President [PER Ben Ali  ] deserves credit for continuing many of the progressive policies of President [PER Bourguiba  ] , he and his regime have lost touch with the [MISC Tunisian  ] people . 
They tolerate no advice or criticism , whether domestic or international . 
Increasingly , they rely on the police for control and focus on preserving power . 
And , corruption in the inner circle is growing . 
Even average [MISC Tunisians  ] are now keenly aware of it , and the chorus of complaints is rising . 
[MISC Tunisians  ] intensely dislike , even hate , [ORG First Lady  ] [PER Leila Trabelsi  ] and her family . 
In private , regime opponents mock her ; even those close to the government express dismay at her reported behavior . 
Meanwhile , anger is growing at Tunisia’s high unemployment and regional inequities . 
As a consequence , the risks to the regime’s long-term stability are increasing. --------------------------------------------- --------------- [MISC US-Tunisian  ] Relations: If Only We Would Say This Is [LOC Paradise  ] --------------------------------------------- --------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) [MISC US-Tunisian  ] relations reflect the realities of the [PER Ben Ali  ] regime . 
On the positive side , we have accomplished several goals in recent years , including:-- increasing substantially [LOC US  ] assistance to the military to combat terrorism ; -- improving ( albeit still with challenges ) some important counterterrorism programs ; -- strengthening commercial ties , including holding a [ORG TIFA Council  ] meeting , hosting several trade and economic delegations and growing business activity ; -- building ties to young people and the cultural community through expanded [MISC English-language  ] programs , a new film festival , and new media outreach efforts ; and -- encouraging congressional interest in [LOC Tunisia.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) But we have also had too many failures . 
The [ORG GOT  ] frequently declines to engage , and there have been too many lost opportunities . 
The [ORG GOT  ] has:-- declined to engage on the [ORG Millennium Challenge Account  ] ; -- declined [LOC USAID  ] regional programs to assist young people ; -- reduced the number of [MISC Fulbright  ] scholarship students ; and , -- declined to engage in [LOC Open Skies  ] negotiations . 
Most troubling has been the [MISC GOT’s  ] unilateral and clumsy effort to impose new and retroactive taxes on the [ORG American Cooperative School of Tunis  ] . 
There is little doubt that this action was at the behest of powerful friends ( probably including [PER Leila Trabelsi  ] ) of the [ORG International School of Carthage  ] . 
It raises important questions about [MISC Tunisian  ] governance and our friendship . 
If , in the end , the [MISC GOT’s  ] actions force the school to close we will need to downsize the [ORG Mission  ] , limit our programs , and dial down our relations. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) At the same time , the [ORG GOT  ] has also increasingly tightened controls that make it exceptionally difficult for the [ORG US Mission  ] to conduct business . 
The controls , put in place by Foreign Minister [PER Abdallah  ] , require the [ORG Mission  ] to obtain written MFA permission for contact with all official and semi-official [MISC Tunisian  ] organizations . 
Mid-level [ORG GOT  ] officials are no longer allowed to communicate with embassy personnel without express authorization and MFA-cleared instructions . 
All meeting requests and demarches must be conveyed by diplomatic note . 
Most go unanswered . 
All Embassies in [LOC Tunis  ] are affected by these controls , but they are no less frustrating for that. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Beyond the stifling bureaucratic controls , the [ORG GOT  ] makes it difficult for the [ORG Mission  ] to maintain contact with a [LOC TUNIS  ] 00000492 003 OF 005 wide swath of [MISC Tunisian  ] society . 
GOT-controlled newspapers often attack [MISC Tunisian  ] civil society activists who participate in Embassy activities , portraying them as traitors . 
Plain-clothes police sometimes lurk outside events hosted by EmbOffs , intimidating participants . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Some of the [MISC GOT’s  ] actions may be related to its intense dislike of the former [MISC Administration’s  ] &freedom agenda.8 The [ORG GOT  ] considered this policy dangerous and believed it opened the door for [MISC Islamic  ] extremists to seize power . 
[ORG GOT  ] leaders have made no secret of their disapproval of the [MISC Ambassador’s  ] and other EmbOffs’ contacts with opposition [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] leaders as well as civil society activists who criticize the regime . 
They were intensely critical , as well , of the previous [MISC Administration’s  ] use of public statements ( such as on [ORG World Press Freedom Day  ] 2008 ) , which they believed unfairly targeted [LOC Tunisia.  ] ---------------------- So , What Should We Do ? ---------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Notwithstanding the frustrations of doing business here , we cannot write off [LOC Tunisia  ] . 
We have too much at stake . 
We have an interest in preventing al-Qaeda in the [MISC Islamic  ] [LOC Maghreb  ] and other extremist groups from establishing a foothold here . 
We have an interest in keeping the [MISC Tunisian  ] military professional and neutral . 
We also have an interest in fostering greater political openness and respect for human rights . 
It is in our interest , too , to build prosperity and Tunisia’s middle class , the underpinning for the country’s long-term stability . 
Moreover , we need to increase mutual understanding to help repair the image of the [LOC United States  ] and secure greater cooperation on our many regional challenges . 
The [LOC United States  ] needs help in this region to promote our values and policies . 
[LOC Tunisia  ] is one place where , in time , we might find it. ----------------- The Extended Hand ----------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Since President [PER Obama’s  ] inauguration , [MISC Tunisians  ] have been more receptive to the [LOC United States  ] . 
Senior [ORG GOT  ] officials have warmly welcomed President [PER Obama’s  ] statements and speeches . 
His address in [LOC Cairo  ] drew particular praise , with the Foreign Minister calling it &courageous.8 Meanwhile , some civil society contacts who had been boycotting Embassy functions in opposition to the war in [LOC Iraq  ] have started coming around again . 
Generally , the metaphor of the &extended hand8 in President [PER Obama’s  ] inaugural address has resonated powerfully with [MISC Tunisians  ] . 
Concretely , the [MISC Tunisians  ] have welcomed many of the [ORG Obama Administration’s  ] actions , including the decision to close the [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] detention center and the plans for troop withdrawals from [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Above all , [MISC Tunisians  ] have been pleased by the President’s tone , statements and actions ( so far ) on [LOC Middle East  ] peace. ----------------------------------------- How To Advance Democracy and [ORG Human Rights  ] ----------------------------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [ORG Obama Administration  ] creates an important opportunity , then , to explore whether and how to pursue a more productive bilateral relationship . 
[ORG GOT  ] officials say the [LOC United States  ] tends to focus on issues where we do not see eye-to-eye . 
They bristle at our calls for greater democratic reform and respect for human rights , and protest they are making progress . 
For years , the [MISC Embassy’s  ] top goal has been to promote progress in these areas . 
We need to keep the focus , especially with 2009 an election year in [LOC Tunisia  ] . 
[PER Ben Ali  ] is certain to be reelected by a wide margin in a process that will be neither free nor fair . 
In this context , we should continue to underscore the importance of these issues , and to maintain contacts with the few opposition parties and civil society groups critical of the regime. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) We should consider how this policy objective is publicly manifested , however . 
For several years , the [LOC United States  ] has been out in front -- publicly and privately -- criticizing the [ORG GOT  ] for the absence of democracy and the lack of respect for human rights . 
There is a place for such [LOC TUNIS  ] 00000492 004 OF 005 criticism , and we do not advocate abandoning it . 
We do recommend a more pragmatic approach , however , whereby we would speak to the [MISC Tunisians  ] very clearly and at a very high level about our concerns regarding Tunisia’s democracy and human rights practices , but dial back the public criticism . 
The key element is more and frequent high-level private candor . 
We recommend being explicit with [ORG GOT  ] leaders that we are changing our approach , while also making clear that we will continue to engage privately with opposition parties and civil society. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) In addition , we should increase our efforts to persuade our [MISC European  ] partners , and other like-minded countries , to step up their efforts to persuade the [ORG GOT  ] to accelerate political reform . 
While some in the [ORG EU  ] ( e.g. , [LOC Germany  ] , the [LOC UK  ] ) agree with us , key countries such as [LOC France  ] and [LOC Italy  ] have shied from putting pressure on the [ORG GOT  ] . 
We should work to get them to do so , and to condition further assistance and advanced [ORG EU  ] associate status on it. ---------------------------- Advancing Other US Interests ---------------------------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) Whether we succeed on democracy and human rights , the [LOC United States  ] has an interest in building relations with a wide spectrum of [MISC Tunisians  ] , particularly the young . 
To do so , and to build good will with the [ORG GOT  ] , we should offer the government a dialogue on a range of issues of mutual interest , backed up by increased assistance . 
Of greatest interest to the [ORG GOT  ] would be increased engagement on economic issues , i.e. , on increasing bilateral trade and investment , as well as the provision of technical assistance , especially involving technology transfer . 
The [MISC Tunisians  ] would welcome a revival of the [MISC US-North African Economic Partnership  ] , as well as other efforts that would promote [MISC North African  ] economic integration. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) In addition , we should offer serious engagement in high-priority areas for [MISC Tunisians  ] that will also benefit the [LOC United States  ] , including: -- more , and more comprehensive , English-language programs ; -- Ph.D. scholarships for [MISC Tunisian  ] students to study in the [LOC United States  ] , such as those that USAID used to make available in the 1970’s and 1980’s ; -- more support for University linkages ; -- more science and technology exchanges -- to give substance to a bilateral [MISC S&T  ] agreement that , with no money behind it , has had little impact ; and -- more cultural programming. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) In addition to talking to the [ORG GOT  ] , we need to engage directly with the [MISC Tunisian  ] people , especially youth . 
The Embassy is already using [ORG Facebook  ] as a communication tool . 
In addition , we have the [MISC Ambassador’s  ] blog , a relatively new undertaking that is attracting attention . 
Over the past couple of years , the Embassy has substantially increased its outreach to [MISC Tunisian  ] youth through concerts , film festivals , and other events . 
Our information resource center and [ORG America’s Corners  ] are popular ways for [MISC Tunisians  ] to access unfiltered news and information . 
We should continue and increase such programs. ------------------------------------------- Advancing Broader Foreign Policy Objectives And [ORG Security Cooperation  ] ------------------------------------------- <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) We should also seek new ways to engage [LOC Tunisia  ] in pursuit of our broader foreign policy agenda . 
We believe that the [ORG GOT  ] would welcome this kind of engagement , and that it would pay dividends , not only in our bilateral relationship but also on transnational issues . 
For example , we continue to count on [ORG GOT  ] support for our efforts to promote [MISC Israel-Palestinian  ] and [MISC Israeli-Arab  ] peace . 
Although [LOC Tunisia  ] has limited influence within the [ORG Arab League  ] , it remains in the moderate camp , as demonstrated most recently by its refusal to participate in the extraordinary [LOC Doha Summit  ] on the situation in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
At appropriate moments , we would recommend doing more to brief the [ORG GOT  ] on our efforts in the peace process and to draw them into providing additional support . 
Special Envoy Mitchell’s stop here in April was well received and we should look for ways to continue such consultations. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( S/NF ) There are opportunities in the area of security cooperation , too . 
For starters , we know that [LOC Tunisia  ] could be doing a better job in sharing intelligence with us about [LOC TUNIS  ] 00000492 005 OF 005 the threat of terrorism in [LOC North Africa  ] . 
This was all too clear when , yet again , the [ORG GOT  ] failed recently to share information with us in a timely fashion on a reported plot against US military personnel . 
GRPO has been taking steps to increase cooperation through liaison channels ; while there has been progress , more is possible. <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( C ) On military cooperation , the time has come to shift our military assistance away from [ORG FMF  ] to more targeted programs that meet specific needs . 
There is increasing evidence the [MISC Tunisian  ] military does not need [ORG FMF  ] to the degree it claims , and in any event it has bought us too little in the way of cooperation . 
Rather , we should focus on working with the [MISC Tunisians  ] to identify a small number of areas were cooperation makes sense . 
The recent use of the [ORG Section  ] 1206 and PKO programs to provide the [MISC Tunisian  ] military with ground surveillance radar and unmanned surveillance aircraft is a good example. --------------------------------------------- ------------- Our [ORG Message: Deeper Cooperation Depends On Real Engagement  ] --------------------------------------------- ------------- <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) [LOC Tunisia  ] is not an ally today , but we still share important history and values . 
It is fair to consider [LOC Tunisia  ] a friend , albeit cautious , closed and distant . 
Most importantly , in a region in turmoil , [LOC Tunisia  ] has better prospects than most even though it is troubled . 
In the end , serious change here will have to await [PER Ben Ali’s  ] departure . 
But President Obama’s new tone and policies may create a window of opportunity . 
We should use it to make overtures to the [ORG GOT  ] in areas where they seek our involvement or assistance . 
And , we should seek to engage all [MISC Tunisians  ] ( especially the young ) in ways that will improve the future for both our countries. <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) To succeed , however , we need resources and commitment from [LOC Washington  ] . 
New and expanded programs will require money and staff to implement them , particularly in public affairs . 
Senior US Government officials must also be prepared to visit more often than in recent years to engage the [MISC Tunisians  ] . 
Meetings outside [LOC Tunisia  ] are a good tool , too . 
The Secretary’s recent meeting with [MISC North African  ] Foreign Ministers on the margins of the [ORG Gaza Reconstruction Conference  ] in [LOC Sharm el-Sheikh  ] provides one model for engagement and offers the added benefit of allowing us to also promote greater [LOC Maghreb  ] integration. <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) Finally , we recommend US officials be clear in all meetings with [MISC Tunisians:  ] more US cooperation depends on real [MISC Tunisian  ] engagement . 
For too long [LOC Tunisia  ] has skated by . 
A small country , in a tough region , the [ORG GOT  ] relies on vague promises of friendship and empty slogans . 
More can and should be expected of [LOC Tunisia  ] . 
The [ORG GOT  ] frequently says it is a US ally and calls for greater US engagement . 
We should respond clearly: yes , but only if we get genuine help from [LOC Tunisia  ] on the challenges that matter to us all . 
The [MISC Tunisian  ] government loves the illusion of engagement . 
The US government should press for the hard work of real cooperation .
