[LOC MOSCOW  ] 0840 Classified By: Ambassador [PER John R. Beyrle:  ] Reasons 1.4 ( b , d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: A decision to move towards a more robust military relationship with [LOC Georgia  ] will imperil our efforts to re-start relations with [LOC Russia  ] , if it is not carefully calibrated and deployed . 
While [PER Medvedev  ] understands the strategic and personal benefits of crafting a productive partnership with the [LOC U.S.  ] , this impulse is trumped by the [ORG GOR  ] 's " absolute " priority placed on expanding [MISC Russian  ] influence in the [MISC Eurasian  ] neighborhood , preventing [ORG NATO  ] enlargement , and demonstrating [LOC Russia  ] 's great power status . 
The [MISC Russian  ] political class and populace is united behind these principles , with the August war confirming for the leadership that the international community lacks the levers to coerce a change in [MISC Russian  ] behavior . 
[MISC Russian  ] criticism of PfP exercises was both sincere -- anger over the " business as usual " approach with [PER Saakashvili  ] -- and tactical , designed to raise the costs of [ORG CIS  ] cooperation with the [LOC West  ] , but was not matched by a change in military posture . 
However , given consistent warnings over the consequences of weapons sales to [LOC Georgia  ] , we believe a lethal military supply relationship with [LOC Tbilisi  ] would come at the cost of advancing [LOC Georgia  ] 's territorial integrity , and could lessen [MISC Russian  ] restraint on weapons transfers to [LOC Iran  ] . 
We believe that keeping the focus on [LOC Georgia  ] 's economic and democratic development , while continuing our military cooperation with [LOC Tbilisi  ] through transparent PfP programming with [MISC European  ] partners , and non-lethal bilateral mil-mil training and assistance , is the only viable -- if very long-term -- strategy to induce better [MISC Russian  ] behavior and restore [MISC Georgian  ] territorial integrity . 
Critical to this effort will be building ballast in a [MISC U.S.-Russian  ] relationship that serves as a break on [LOC Russia  ] 's worst instincts . 
End Summary Showdown Over [LOC Georgia  ] ? ---------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) If not carefully calibrated and deployed , a decision to move towards a more robust military relationship with [LOC Georgia  ] has the very real potential to trigger a dispute on a set of issues that are both neuralgic and strategic for the [MISC Russian  ] political and military establishment , endangering the [ORG Administration  ] 's effort to undertake a fresh start with [LOC Moscow  ] . 
While [PER Medvedev  ] appears seized with taking charge of the [MISC U.S.-Russian  ] account and placing it on a new footing during the July summit , this policy impulse will be subordinate to [LOC Russia  ] 's " strategic interests " in its [MISC Eurasian  ] neighborhood , as defined by both [PER Medvedev  ] and [PER Putin  ] . 
[MISC Russian  ] intransigence on the UNOMIG rollover is a conspicuous illustration of this . 
We cannot accept this [MISC Russian  ] calculus , but we need to understand what drives the [LOC Kremlin  ] and [LOC White House:  ] -- [LOC Russia  ] places an " absolute " priority on expanding its influence and deepening its integration with neighboring states , as part of a self-conscious policy to combat the [LOC West  ] 's " creep " towards its borders ( ref a ) . 
Inevitably , the question of [LOC Russia  ] 's status in the [MISC Eurasian  ] " neighborhood , " and the presumed zero-sum competition for influence along [LOC Russia  ] 's borders , will remain our most contentious bilateral issue and the likeliest stumbling block to improved [MISC U.S.-Russian  ] relations . 
-- [LOC Russia  ] opposes any further enlargement of [ORG NATO  ] . 
The August war in [LOC Georgia  ] signaled [LOC Moscow  ] 's readiness to expend materiel and men to achieve this goal , even at the cost of international opprobrium . 
The fact that [ORG NATO  ] membership for both [LOC Georgia  ] and [LOC Ukraine  ] is not a front burner priority has not tempered [LOC Moscow  ] 's stance , since the [MISC Russian  ] leadership sees this as a temporary reprieve , brought about by [MISC European  ] reservations and not by a change in policy by the [ORG Obama Administration  ] . 
-- Absent a standstill agreement on [ORG NATO  ] , which [PER Medvedev  ] hopes to achieve through discussions over a new [ORG European Security Treaty  ] , [LOC Russia  ] presumes that we seek its strategic neutering . 
Our principled rejection of a [MISC Russian  ] sphere of influence is read here as a denial of [LOC Russia  ] 's status as a great power , and another example of [LOC U.S  ] . 
" double standards , " rather than a repudiation of a [ORG Warsaw Pact  ] mentality . 
-- [LOC Russia  ] judges that we lack the bilateral or multilateral levers to coerce it into moderating its stance on [LOC Georgia  ] or reversing its recognition of the conflict territories . 
[LOC Moscow  ] assumes that we have too many strategic interests in common to credibly threaten [LOC Russia  ] with a cut-off in relations -- a move that [LOC Europe  ] ( both old and new ) never [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00001591 002 OF 003 seriously contemplated in the wake of the [MISC Georgian  ] war . 
-- [MISC Russian  ] leaders enjoy a policy carte blanche on [LOC Georgia  ] , with respect to domestic public opinion . 
Polls consistently show that [MISC Russians  ] overwhelmingly welcome [LOC Moscow  ] 's resurgent foreign policy , revile [PER Saakashvili  ] , and blame [MISC Euro-Atlantic  ] institutions for [LOC Moscow  ] 's worsening relations with former republics and [ORG Warsaw Pact  ] partners . 
There is absolutely no difference between [PER Medvedev  ] and [PER Putin  ] when it comes to [LOC Georgia  ] . 
[MISC Russian  ] Warnings Over [MISC Mil-Mil Relations  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [LOC Russia  ] has used the previously scheduled [ORG Cooperative Longbow/Cooperative Lancer  ] PfP exercises and [MISC U.S./NATO  ] discussions of [MISC Georgian  ] military reform to hint at a political price tag for continued cultivation of [LOC Georgia  ] as a [ORG NATO  ] aspirant . 
While [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador to [ORG NATO  ] Rogozin 's characterization of the exercises as " an absurdity and madness " were discounted in [ORG NATO  ] circles , he accurately channeled [LOC Moscow  ] 's anger over what was seen as a " business as usual " policy towards [PER Saakashvili  ] , as well as [LOC Moscow  ] 's strategy of raising the potential costs of participation by other [ORG CIS  ] states . 
[PER Medvedev  ] labeled the exercises " muscle-flexing , " an " outright provocation , " and " a mistaken and dangerous decision , " while [PER Putin  ] questioned the " reset " in [MISC U.S.-Russian  ] relations , pointing to the exercises as a " signal in a different direction . 
" Even mild-mannered [MISC DFM Ryabkov  ] fulminated publicly against the " cheap and unconvincing arguments " used to justify PfP . 
Pro-Kremlin and opposition politicians emphasized that a " return to last August " or a " new [MISC Cold War  ] " might flow from a continued [ORG NATO  ] embrace of [LOC Tbilisi  ] . 
Despite the harsh rhetoric , however , [LOC Russia  ] did not place its troops on alert during the exercises , which proceeded smoothly. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) When it comes to weapons sales to [LOC Tbilisi  ] , [MISC Russian  ] actions have been harsher . 
For those few [MISC Russian  ] officials willing to believe that the [LOC U.S.  ] did not directly goad [LOC Georgia  ] into attacking , it is an article of faith that [LOC Georgia  ] 's military relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] triggered [PER Saakashvili  ] 's fateful miscalculation on August 8 . 
While accusing [LOC Georgia  ] of 30-fold increases in military spending ( at 7-8 percent of GDP ) , in addition to illicit purchases from [MISC Ukrainian  ] and [MISC Israeli  ] middlemen , and an overconfidence spawned by [LOC U.S.  ] assurances of support , the [ORG GOR  ] called for an arms embargo against [LOC Georgia  ] in the war 's aftermath . 
Invoking [ORG OSCE  ] and [ORG UN  ] conventions against the provision of offensive weapons to conflict zones , [PER Medvedev  ] then promulgated a January presidential decree allowing for unilateral sanctions against countries that assist [LOC Tbilisi  ] in its " remilitarization . 
" Both [PER Medvedev  ] and [PER Putin  ] appear to believe that the [LOC U.S.  ] already has supplied [LOC Tbilisi  ] surreptitiously with arms , which illustrates the invidious role , as well as dominance , of the security services in running [MISC Russian  ] policy in the [LOC Caucasus  ] . 
A [ORG Better Focus: Economy  ] , [ORG CBMS  ] , and PfP -------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) From our perspective , the challenge is to demonstrate that the [LOC U.S.  ] will protect its legitimate interests in the [LOC Caucasus  ] -- including support for [MISC Georgian  ] sovereignty , territorial integrity and the democratically elected government of [LOC Georgia  ] -- without triggering a tit-for-tat military escalation that we cannot win , but that [LOC Georgia  ] can surely lose . 
From our vantage point , a burgeoning military supply relationship with [LOC Georgia  ] is more of a liability for [LOC Georgia  ] than a benefit . 
It would do nothing to secure a long-term resolution of [LOC Abkhazia  ] and [LOC South Ossetia  ] , allowing [LOC Russia  ] to " justify " its military buildup in the conflict territories , increasing the insecurities of the [LOC Abkhaz  ] and [LOC South Ossetian  ] populations already distrustful of [PER Saakashvili  ] , and driving the separatist leaders further into [LOC Moscow  ] 's arms . 
It would almost certainly raise the temperature , rather than maintaining the unsatisfactory status quo long enough for economic development and confidence-building measures to chip away at the current hostile standoff . 
The ramifications of a policy clash on weapons sales could also be felt elsewhere , with [LOC Moscow  ] seizing a pretext to move forward on the delivery of [MISC S-300s  ] to [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) As we have argued separately ( ref b ) , the [LOC U.S.  ] will be most effective in countering [MISC Russian  ] actions by acting in concert with [LOC Europe  ] to help [LOC Georgia  ] demonstrate to the [LOC Abkhaz  ] and [LOC South Ossetians  ] that autonomy with [LOC Tbilisi  ] is better than submission to [LOC Russia  ] . 
[MISC Russian  ] corruption , heavy-handedness and reliance on criminalized local leaders ultimately will [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00001591 003 OF 003 play to [LOC Georgia  ] 's advantage . 
While [LOC Georgia  ] cannot reconquer its lost territory by force , it can establish itself as a democratically vibrant and economically successful model for the region . 
By keeping the international focus on economic assistance to [LOC Tbilisi  ] and on creating credible international monitoring regimes , we can create the time and space to intensify cooperation with [LOC Russia  ] in other areas of strategic interest , adding ballast to the [MISC U.S.-Russian  ] relationship that could make [LOC Moscow  ] think twice about exacerbating tensions in the [LOC Caucasus.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) This is not to say that the [LOC U.S.  ] should be constrained in providing bilateral non-lethal military assistance , training , or other equipment clearly directed at assisting [LOC Georgia  ] 's basic requirements to control its borders , maintain law and order and counter terrorism . 
In addition , we believe that PfP exercises and programs should be pursued as part of the standard [ORG NATO  ] toolbox for cooperation with non-member states , notwithstanding [MISC Russian  ] rhetorical umbrage . 
The value of building [MISC Georgian  ] capacity for international peacekeeping , counter-narcotics , civil-military emergency preparedness , and anti-terrorism operations is obvious . 
PfP has the advantage of greater transparency and reinforcing a common [MISC U.S.-European  ] approach to [LOC Georgia  ] ; conceivably , when relations stabilize , [LOC Russia  ] could be included as an observer . 
While [MISC Russian  ] forces will remain concentrated in the neighboring territories for the near-term , our goal of securing a [MISC Russian  ] drawdown and then departure will not be accomplished through a [LOC U.S.  ] military sales relationship or lethal training program . 
Instead , we should hold [PER Medvedev  ] accountable to the principles of his [ORG European Security Treaty  ] initiative , which are based on respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty . 
[MISC Comment: U.S.-Russia Relations  ] Matter ------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) We in no way accede to [MISC Russian  ] redlines by acknowledging that [LOC Georgia  ] could never win a military confrontation with [LOC Russia  ] , and should not be encouraged to pursue a strategy that focuses on military force as the underpinning to a stronger , more stable country . 
We recognize that our suggested approach would be deeply dissatisfying to [PER Saakashvili  ] , but we see no short-term fix to the generational estrangement triggered by the August war and no way to neutralize the advantages of geography , size , and capabilities enjoyed by [LOC Russia  ] . 
Instead , consistent and coordinated initiatives by the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Europe  ] to assist [LOC Georgia  ] , implement monitoring regimes , and persuade [LOC Russia  ] to engage credibly will be better advanced in an environment where the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia  ] are not in a hostile standoff . 
Our assessment is that if we say " yes " to a significant military relationship with [LOC Tbilisi  ] , [LOC Russia  ] will say " no " to any medium-term diminution in tensions , and feel less constrained absent reverting to more active opposition to critical [LOC U.S.  ] strategic interests .
