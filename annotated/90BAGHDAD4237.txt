SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
SUMMARY: SADDAM TOLD THE AMBASSADOR JULY 25 THAT MUBARAK HAS ARRANGED FOR [MISC KUWAITI  ] AND IRAQI DELEGATIONS TO MEET IN [LOC RIYADH  ] , AND THEN ON JULY 28 , 29 OR 30 , THE [MISC KUWAITI  ] CROWN PRINCE WILL COME TO [LOC BAGHDAD  ] FOR SERIOUS NEGOTIATIONS . 
" NOTHING WILL HAPPEN " BEFORE THEN , SADDAM HAD PROMISED MUBARAK. --SADDAM WISHED TO CONVEY AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO PRESIDENT BUSH: [LOC IRAQ  ] WANTS FRIENDSHIP , BUT DOES THE USG ? 
[LOC IRAQ  ] SUFFERED 100,000'S OF CASUALTIES AND IS NOW SO POOR THAT WAR ORPHAN PENSIONS WILL SOON BE CUT ; YET RICH KUWAIT WILL NOT EVEN ACCEPT [ORG OPEC  ] DISCIPLINE . 
[LOC IRAQ  ] IS SICK OF WAR , BUT KUWAIT HAS IGNORED DIPLOMACY . 
USG MANEUVERS WITH THE UAE WILL ENCOURAGE THE UAE AND KUWAIT TO IGNORE CONVENTIONAL DIPLOMACY . 
IF [LOC IRAQ  ] IS PUBLICLY HUMILIATED BY THE USG , IT WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO " RESPOND , " HOWEVER ILLOGICAL AND SELF DESTRUCTIVE THAT WOULD PROVE. --ALTHOUGH NOT QUITE EXPLICIT , SADDAM'S MESSAGE TO US SEEMED TO BE THAT HE WILL MAKE A MAJOR PUSH TO COOPERATE WITH MUBARAK'S DIPLOMACY , BUT WE MUST TRY TO UNDERSTAND KUWAITI/UAE " SELFISHNESS " IS UNBEARABLE . 
AMBASSADOR MADE CLEAR THAT WE CAN NEVER EXCUSE SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES BY OTHER THAN PEACEFUL MEANS . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
AMBASSADOR WAS SUMMONED BY PRESIDENT SADDAM HUSAYN AT NOON JULY 25 . 
ALSO PRESENT WERE FONMIN AZIZ , [ORG THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE DIRECTOR  ] , TWO NOTETAKERS , AND THE IRAQI INTERPRETER. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
[PER SADDAM  ] , WHOSE MANNER WAS CORDIAL , REASONABLE AND EVEN WARM THROUGHOUT THE ENSUING TWO HOURS , SAID HE WISHED THE AMBASSADOR TO CONVEY A MESSAGE TO PRESIDENT BUSH . 
[PER SADDAM  ] THEN RECALLED IN DETAIL THE HISTORY OF IRAQ'S DECISION TO REESTABLISH DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS AND ITS POSTPONING IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT DECISION AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR , RATHER THAN BE THOUGHT WEAK AND NEEDY . 
HE THEN SPOKE ABOUT THE MANY " BLOWS " OUR RELATIONS HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO SINCE 1984 , CHIEF AMONG THEM IRANGATE . 
IT WAS AFTER THE FAW VICTORY , [PER SADDAM  ] SAID , THAT IRAQI MISAPPREHENSIONS ABOUT USG PURPOSES BEGAN TO SURFACE AGAIN , I.E. , SUSPICIONS THAT THE [LOC U.S.  ] WAS NOT HAPPY TO SEE THE WAR END. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
PICKING HIS WORDS WITH CARE , [PER SADDAM  ] SAID THAT THERE ARE " [MISC SOME CIRCLES  ] " IN [MISC THE USG  ] , INCLUDING IN CIA AND [MISC THE STATE DEPARTMENT  ] , BUT EMPHATICALLY EXCLUDING THE PRESIDENT AND SECRETARY BAKER , WHO ARE NOT FRIENDLY TOWARD IRAQ-U.S . 
RELATIONS . 
HE THEN LISTED WHAT HE SEEMED TO REGARD AS FACTS TO SUPPORT THIS CONCLUSION: " [MISC SOME CIRCLES  ] ARE GATHERING INFORMATION ON WHO MIGHT BE [PER SADDAM  ] HUSAYN'S SUCCESSOR ; " THEY KEPT UP CONTACTS IN THE GULF WARNING AGAINST [LOC IRAQ  ] ; THEY WORKED TO ENSURE NO HELP WOULD GO TO [LOC IRAQ  ] ( READ EXIM AND CCC ) . <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
[LOC IRAQ  ] , THE PRESIDENT STRESSED , IS IN SERIOUS FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES , WITH 40 BILLION USD DEBTS . 
[LOC IRAQ  ] , WHOSE VICTORY IN THE WAR AGAINST [LOC IRAN  ] MADE AN HISTORIC DIFFERENCE TO THE ARAB WORLD AND THE WEST , NEEDS A MARSHALL PLAN . 
BUT " YOU WANT THE OIL PRICE DOWN , " [ORG SADDAM CHARGED.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
RESUMING HIS LIST OF GRIEVANCES WHICH HE BELIEVED WERE ALL INSPIRED BY " [MISC SOME CIRCLES  ] " IN [MISC THE USG  ] , HE RECALLED THE " [ORG USIA  ] CAMPAIGN " AGAINST HIMSELF , AND THE GENERAL MEDIA ASSAULT ON [LOC IRAQ  ] AND ITS PRESIDENT. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
DESPITE ALL THESE BLOWS , [PER SADDAM  ] SAID , AND ALTHOUGH " WE WERE SOMEWHAT ANNOYED , " WE STILL HOPED THAT WE COULD DEVELOP A GOOD RELATIONSHIP . 
BUT THOSE WHO FORCE OIL PRICES DOWN ARE ENGAGING IN ECONOMIC WARFARE AND [LOC IRAQ  ] CANNOT ACCEPT SUCH A TRESPASS ON ITS DIGNITY AND PROSPERITY. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
THE SPEARHEADS ( FOR [MISC THE USG  ] ) HAVE BEEN KUWAIT AND THE UAE , [PER SADDAM  ] SAID . 
[PER SADDAM  ] SAID CAREFULLY THAT JUST AS [LOC IRAQ  ] WILL NOT THREATEN OTHERS , IT WILL ACCEPT NO THREAT AGAINST ITSELF . 
" WE HOPE THE USG WILL NOT MISUNDERSTAND: " [LOC IRAQ  ] ACCEPTS , AS THE STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN SAID , THAT ANY COUNTRY MAY CHOOSE ITS FRIENDS . 
BUT THE USG KNOWS THAT IT WAS [LOC IRAQ  ] , NOT THE USG , WHICH DECISIVELY PROTECTED THOSE USG FRIENDS DURING THE WAR--AND THAT IS UNDERSTANDABLE SINCE PUBLIC OPINION IN THE USG , TO SAY NOTHING OF GEOGRAPHY , WOULD HAVE MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE AMERICANS TO ACCEPT 10,000 DEAD IN A SINGLE BATTLE , AS [LOC IRAQ  ] DID. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
[PER SADDAM  ] ASKED WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR THE USG TO ANNOUNCE IT IS COMMITTED TO THE DEFENSE OF ITS FRIENDS , INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY . 
ANSWERING HIS OWN QUESTION , HE SAID THAT TO [LOC IRAQ  ] IT MEANS FLAGRANT BIAS AGAINST THE GOI. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
COMING TO ONE OF HIS MAIN POINTS , [PER SADDAM  ] ARGUED THAT USG MANEUVERS WITH THE UAE AND KUWAIT ( SIC ) ENCOURAGED THEM IN THEIR UNGENEROUS POLICIES . 
THE IRAQI RIGHTS , SADDAM EMPHASIZED , WILL BE RESTORED ONE BY ONE , THOUGH IT MAY TAKE A MONTH OR MUCH MORE THAN A YEAR . 
[LOC IRAQ  ] HOPES THE USG WILL BE IN HARMONY WITH ALL THE PARTIES TO THIS DISPUTE. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
[PER SADDAM  ] SAID HE UNDERSTANDS THAT THE USG IS DETERMINED TO KEEP THE OIL FLOWING AND TO MAINTAIN ITS FRIENDSHIPS IN THE GULF . 
WHAT HE CANNOT UNDERSTAND IS WHY WE ENCOURAGE THOSE WHO ARE DAMAGING [LOC IRAQ  ] , WHICH IS WHAT OUR GULF MANEUVERS WILL DO. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
[PER SADDAM  ] SAID HE FULLY BELIEVES THE USG WANTS PEACE , AND THAT IS GOOD . 
BUT DO NOT , HE ASKED , USE METHODS WHICH YOU SAY YOU DO NOT LIKE , METHODS LIKE ARM-TWISTING- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
AT THIS POINT SADDAM SPOKE AT LENGTH ABOUT PRIDE OF IRAQIS , WHO BELIEVE IN " LIBERTY OR DEATH . 
" [LOC IRAQ  ] WILL HAVE TO RESPOND IF THE [LOC U.S.  ] USES THESE METHODS . 
[LOC IRAQ  ] KNOWS THE USG CAN SEND PLANES AND ROCKETS AND HURT [LOC IRAQ  ] DEEPLY . 
[PER SADDAM  ] ASKS THAT THE USG NOT FORCE [LOC IRAQ  ] TO THE POINT OF HUMILIATION AT WHICH LOGIC MUST BE DISREGARDED . 
[LOC IRAQ  ] DOES NOT CONSIDER THE [LOC U.S.  ] AN ENEMY AND HAS TRIED TO BE FRIENDS. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
AS FOR THE INTRA-ARAB DISPUTES , [PER SADDAM  ] SAID HE IS NOT ASKING THE USG TO TAKE UP ANY PARTICULAR ROLE SINCE THE SOLUTIONS MUST COME THROUGH ARAB AND BILATERAL DIPLOMACY. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
RETURNING TO HIS THEME THAT [LOC IRAQ  ] WANTS DIGNITY AND FREEDOM AS WELL AS FRIENDSHIP WITH THE [LOC U.S.  ] , HE CHARGED THAT IN THE LAST YEAR THERE WERE MANY OFFICIAL STATEMENTS WHICH MADE IT SEEM THAT THE [LOC U.S.  ] DOES NOT WANT TO RECIPROCATE . 
HOW , FOR EXAMPLE , [PER SADDAM  ] ASKED , CAN WE INTERPRET THE INVITATION FOR ARENS TO VISIT AT A TIME OF CRISIS IN THE GULF ? 
WHY DID THE U.S- DEFENSE MINISTER MAKE " INFLAMMATORY " STATEMENTS ? <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
[PER SADDAM  ] SAID THAT THE IRAQIS KNOW WHAT WAR IS , WANT NO MORE OF IT-- " DO NOT PUSH US TO IT ; DO NOT MAKE IT THE ONLY OPTION LEFT WITH WHICH WE CAN PROTECT OUR DIGNITY . 
" <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
PRESIDENT BUSH , [PER SADDAM  ] SAID , HAS MADE NO MISTAKE IN HIS PRESIDENCY VIS-A-VIS THE ARABS . 
THE DECISION ON THE PLO DIALOGUE WAS " MISTAKEN , " BUT IT WAS TAKEN UNDER " ZIONIST PRESSURE " AND , [PER SADDAM  ] SAID , IS PERHAPS A CLEVER TACTIC TO ABSORB THAT PRESSURE. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
AFTER A SHORT DIVERSION ON THE NEED FOR THE [LOC U.S.  ] TO CONSIDER THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF 200,000 ARABS WITH THE SAME VIGOR AND INTEREST AS THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF THE ISRAELIS , [PER SADDAM  ] CONCLUDED BY RESTATING THAT [LOC IRAQ  ] WANTS AMERICAN FRIENDSHIP " ALTHOUGH WE WILL NOT PANT FOR IT , WE WILL DO OUR PART AS FRIENDS . 
" <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
[PER SADDAM  ] THEN OFFERED AN ANECDOTE TO ILLUSTRATE HIS POINT . 
HE HAD TOLD THE IRAQI KURDISH LEADER IN 1974 THAT HE WAS PREPARED TO GIVE UP HALF OF THE SHATT AL-ARAB TO [LOC IRAN  ] TO OBTAIN ALL OF A PROSPEROUS [LOC IRAQ  ] . 
[ORG THE KURD  ] HAD BET THAT SADDAM WOULD NOT GIVE HALF THE SHATT--THE KURD WAS WRONG . 
EVEN NOW , [ORG THE ONLY REAL ISSUE  ] WITH [LOC IRAN  ] IS THE SHATT , AND IF GIVING AWAY HALF OF THE WATERWAY IS THE ONLY THING STANDING BETWEEN THE CURRENT SITUATION AND IRAQI PROSPERITY , [PER SADDAM  ] SAID HE WOULD BE GUIDED BY WHAT HE DID IN 1974. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
[ORG THE  ] AMBASSADOR THANKED SADDAM FOR [ORG THE OPPORTUNITY  ] TO DISCUSS DIRECTLY WITH HIM SOME OF HIS AND OUR CONCERNS . 
PRESIDENT BUSH , TOO , WANTS FRIENDSHIP , AS HE HAD WRITTEN AT THE 'ID AND ON THE OCCASION OF IRAQ'S NATIONAL DAY . 
[PER SADDAM  ] INTERRUPTED TO SAY HE HAD BEEN TOUCHED BY THOSE <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
AMBASSADOR RESUMED HER THEME , RECALLING THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD INSTRUCTED HER TO BROADEN AND DEEPEN OUR RELATIONS WITH [LOC IRAQ  ] . 
[ORG SADDAM  ] HAD REFERRED TO " SOME CIRCLES " ANTIPATHETIC TO THAT AIM . 
SUCH CIRCLES CERTAINLY EXISTED , BUT [ORG THE U.S.  ] ADMINISTRATION IS INSTRUCTED BY THE PRESIDENT . 
ON THE OTHER HAND , THE PRESIDENT DOES NOT CONTROL THE AMERICAN PRESS ; IF HE DID , CRITICISM OF THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD NOT EXIST . 
[ORG SADDAM  ] AGAIN INTERRUPTED TO SAY HE UNDERSTOOD THAT . 
THE AMBASSADOR SAID SHE HAD SEEN THE DIANE SAWYER SHOW AND THOUGHT THAT IT WAS CHEP AND UNFAIR . 
BUT THE AMERICAN PRESS TREATS ALL POLITICIANS WITHOUT KID GLOVES--THAT IS OUR WAY. <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS VERY RECENTLY REAFFIRMED HIS DESIRE FOR A BETTER RELATIONSHIP AND HAS PROVEN THAT BY , FOR EXAMPLE , OPPOSING SANCTIONS BILLS . 
HERE SADDAM INTERRUPTED AGAIN . 
LAUGHING , HE SAID THERE IS NOTHING LEFT FOR [LOC IRAQ  ] TO BUY IN THE [LOC U.S.  ] EVERYTHING IS PROHIBITED EXCEPT FOR WHEAT , AND NO DOUBT THAT WILL SOON BE DECLARED A DUAL-USE ITEM- [ORG SADDAM  ] SAID , [LOC HOWEVER  ] , HE HAD DECIDED NOT TO RAISE THIS ISSUE , BUT RATHER CONCENTRATE ON THE FAR MORE IMPORTANT ISSUES AT [LOC HAND.  ] <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
AMBASSADOR SAID THERE WERE MANY ISSUES HE HAD RAISED SHE WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON , BUT SHE WISHED TO USE HER LIMITED TIME WITH THE PRESIDENT TO STRESS FIRST PRESIDENT BUSH'S DESIRE FOR FRIENDSHIP AND , SECOND , HIS STRONG DESIRE , SHARED WE ASSUME BY [LOC IRAQ  ] , FOR PEACE AND STABILITY IN THE MID EAST . 
IS IT NOT REASONABLE FOR US TO BE CONCERNED WHEN THE PRESIDENT AND THE FOREIGN MINISTER BOTH SAY PUBLICLY THAT KUWAITI ACTIONS ARE THE EQUIVALENT OF MILITARY AGGRESSION , AND THEN WE LEARN THAT MANY UNITS OF THE REPUBLICAN GUARD HAVE BEEN SENT TO THE BORDER ? 
IS IT NOT REASONABLE FOR US TO ASK , IN THE SPIRIT OF FRIENDSHIP , NOT CONFRONTATION , THE SIMPLE QUESTION: WHAT ARE YOUR INTENTIONS ? <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
[ORG SADDAM  ] SAID THAT WAS INDEED A REASONABLE QUESTION . 
HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED FOR REGIONAL PEACE , IN FACT IT IS OUR DUTY AS A SUPERPOWER . 
" BUT HOW CAN WE MAKE THEM ( [LOC KUWAIT  ] AND UAE ) UNDERSTAND HOW DEEPLY WE ARE SUFFERING . 
" [ORG THE FINANCIAL  ] SITUATION IS SUCH THAT THE PENSIONS FOR WIDOWS AND ORPHANS WILL HAVE TO BE CUT . 
AT THIS POINT , THE INTERPRETER AND ONE OF THE NOTETAKERS BROKE DOWN AND WEPT. <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
AFTER A PAUSE FOR RECUPERATION , [ORG SADDAM  ] SAID , IN EFFECT , BELIEVE ME I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING: WE SENT ENVOYS , WROTE MESSAGES , ASKED FAHD TO ARRANGE QUADRAPARTITE SUMMIT ( [LOC IRAQ  ] , [LOC SAG  ] , [LOC UE  ] , [LOC KUWAIT  ] ) . 
FAHD SUGGESTFD OIL MINISTERS INSTEAD AND WE AGREED TO THE JEDDAH AGREEMENT ALTHOUGH IT WAS WELL BELOW OUR HOPES . 
THEN , [ORG SADDAM  ] CONTINUED , TWO DAYS LATER THE KUWAITI OIL MINISTER ANNOUNCED HE WOULD WANT TO ANNUL THAT AGREEMENT WITHIN TWO MONTHS . 
AS FOR THE UAE , [ORG SADDAM  ] SAID , I BEGGED SHAYKH ZAYID TO UNDERSTAND OUR PROBLEMS ( WHEN SADDAM ENTERTAINED HIM IN MOSUL AFTER THE BAGHDAD SUMMIT ) , AND ZAYID SAID JUST WAIT UNTIL I GET BACK TO ABU DHABI . 
BUT THEN HIS MINISTER OF OIL MADE " BAD STATEMENTS . 
" <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
AT THIS POINT , [PER SADDAM  ] LEFT THE ROOM TO TAKE AN URGENT CALL FROM MUBARAK . 
AFTER HIS RETURN , THE AMBASSADOR ASKED IF HE COULD TELL HER IF THERE HAS ANY PROGRESS IN FINDING A PEACEFUL WAY TO DEFUSE THE DISPUTE . 
THIS WAS SOMETHING PRESIDENT BUSH WOULD BE KEENLY INTERESTED TO KNOW . 
[ORG SADDAM  ] SAID THAT HE HAD JUST LEARNED FROM MUBARAK THE KUWAITIS HAVE AGREED TO NEGOTIATE . 
THE KUWAITI CROWN PRINCE/PRIME MINISTER WOULD MEET IN RIYADH WITH SADDAM'S NUMBER TWO , IZZAT IBRAHIM , AND THEN THE KUWAITI WOULD COME TO BAGHDAD ON SATURDAY , SUNDAY OR , AT [MISC THE LATEST  ] , MONDAY , JULY 30. <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
" I TOLD MUBARAK , " [ORG SADDAM  ] SAID , THAT " NOTHING WILL HAPPEN UNTIL THE MEETING , " AND NOTHING WILL HAPPEN DURING OR AFTER THE MEETING IF THE KUWAITIS WILL AT LAST " GIVE US SOME HOPE . 
" <a id='par29' href='#par29'>¶</a>29 . 
THE AMBASSADOR SAID SHE WAS DELIGHTED TO HEAR THIS GOOD NEWS . 
[ORG SADDAM  ] THEN ASKED HER TO CONVEY HIS WARM GREETINGS TO PRESIDENT BUSH AND TO CONVEY HIS MESSAGE TO HIM. <a id='par30' href='#par30'>¶</a>30 . 
NOTE: ON THE BORDER QUESTION , [ORG SADDAM  ] REFERRED TO THE 1961 AGREEMENT AND A " LINE OF PATROL " IT HAD ESTABLISHED . 
THE KUWAITIS , HE SAID , HAD TOLD MUBARAK [LOC IRAQ  ] WAS 20 KILOMETERS " IN FRONT " OF THIS LINE . 
THE AMBASSADOR SAID THAT SHE HAD SERVED IN [LOC KUWAIT  ] 20 YEARS BEFORE ; THEN , AS NOW , WE TOOK NO POSITION ON THESE ARAB AFFAIRS. <a id='par31' href='#par31'>¶</a>31 . 
COMMENT: IN THE MEMORY QF THE CURRENT DIPLOMATIC CORPS , [ORG SADDAM  ] HAS NEVER SUMMONED AN AMBASSADOR . 
HE IS WORRIED . 
ACCORDING TO HIS OWN POLITICAL THEORIZING ( [LOC U.S.  ] THE SOLE MAJOR POWER IN THE MIDDLE EAST ) , HE NEEDS AT A MINIMUM A CORRECT RELATIONSHIP WITH US FOR OBVIOUS GEOPOLITICAL REASONS , ESPECIALLY AS LONG AS HE PERCEIVES MORTAL THREATS FROM [LOC ISRAEL  ] AND [LOC IRAN  ] . 
AMBASSADOR BELIEVES SADDAM SUSPECTS OUR DECISION SUDDENLY TO UNDERTAKE MANEUVERS WITH ABU DHABI IS A HARBINGER OF A USG DECISION TO TAKE SIDES . 
FURTHER , [ORG SADDAM  ] , HIMSELF BEGINNING TO HAVE AN INKLING OF HOW MUCH HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE [LOC U.S.  ] , IS APPREHENSIVE THAT WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND CERTAIN POLITICAL FACTORS WHICH INHIBIT HIM , SUCH AS: --HE CANNOT ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE PERCEIVED AS CAVING IN TO SUPERPOWER BULLYING ( AS U/S HAMDUN FRANKLY WARNED US IN LATE 1988 ) ; --IRAQ , WHICH LOST 100,000'S OF CASUALTIES , IS SUFFERING AND [LOC KUWAIT  ] IS " MISERLY " AND " SELFISH . 
" <a id='par32' href='#par32'>¶</a>32 . 
IT WAS PROGRESS TO HAVE SADDAM ADMIT THAT THE USG HAS A " RESPONSIBILITY " IN THE REGION , AND HAS EVERY RIGHT TO EXPECT AN ANSWER WHEN WE ASK IRAQ'S INTENTIONS . 
HIS RESPONSE IN EFFECT THAT HE TRIED VARIOUS DIPLOMATIC/CHANNELS BEFORE RESORTING TO UNADULTERATED INTIMIDATION HAS AT LEAST THE VIRTUE OF FRANKNESS . 
HIS EMPHASIS THAT HE WANTS PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT IS SURELY SINCERE ( IRAQIS ARE SICK OF WAR ) , BUT THE TERMS SOUND DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE . 
[ORG SADDAM  ] SEEMS TO WANT PLEDGES NOW ON OIL PRICES AND PRODUCTION TO COVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS .
