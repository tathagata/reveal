Cretz  ] , Ambassador , [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy - [LOC Tripoli  ] , [LOC U.S.  ] Dept of State . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) During a June 21 meeting , Ambassador pressed FM [PER Musa Kusa  ] to establish a more direct mechanism to provide regular [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy access to returned [ORG GTMO  ] detainees and information on their legal status , saying the [ORG GOL  ] 's cooperation could improve prospects for the return of other [MISC Libyan  ] detainees. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Kusa  ] said the [ORG GOL  ] had cooperated with the [LOC U.S.  ] on apprehending and questioning al-Qaeda terrorists since the September 2001 attacks in [LOC New York  ] . 
[PER Kusa  ] and other [MISC Arab  ] security chiefs ( [PER Kusa  ] was head of [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG External Security Organization  ] until his appointment as Foreign Minister this year ) had expected the [ORG USG  ] to return the al-Qaeda suspects to their countries of origin after questioning by the [LOC U.S.  ] , but this had not transpired . 
The [ORG GOL  ] understands that the [ORG USG  ] is " under pressure " from human rights groups not to return the suspects to certain countries . 
While [LOC Libya  ] wants to be helpful , it is not pressing for the return of the remaining [MISC Libyan  ] detainees to [LOC Libya  ] . 
" We are not overly concerned about them , " he said. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) If the [ORG USG  ] does decide to transfer the detainees to [LOC Libya  ] , [PER Kusa  ] asked that the [ORG GOL  ] be informed in advance . 
The detainees would be incarcerated and referred to the [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] ( headed by [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi ) , which operates a rehabilitation program for extremists in [LOC Libya  ] 's security prisons . 
The detainees would be entitled to family visits like other prisoners . 
[PER Kusa  ] warned that some of the [MISC Libyan  ] detainees might return to violence if they were released . 
The Ambassador pressed several times for [PER Kusa  ] 's commitment to provide regular Embassy access and information on the current returnees' legal status , but [PER Kusa  ] did not make any specific commitments in this regard. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Comment: [PER Kusa  ] 's comments reflect no change in [LOC Libya  ] 's policy of providing limited access and information regarding detainees returned to [LOC Libya  ] . 
The [ORG GOL  ] appears reluctant to agree to a formal mechanism to provide regular access and detailed information on detainees' legal status -- issues it considers to be sensitive internal matters . 
That said , the [ORG GOL  ] has granted the Embassy access to the two returnees currently in [MISC Libyan  ] custody on a case-by-case basis ( the access has at times been timely , but more often has come after significant delay ) and has continuted to offer assurances that the detainees are being treated humanely . 
End comment .
