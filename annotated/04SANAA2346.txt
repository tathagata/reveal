End Summary. --------------------------------------------- [PER Saleh  ] -- " We Have to Get [MISC Them Off the Market  ] " --------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG A/S Lincoln P. Bloomfield Jr.  ] and Ambassador met with [MISC Yemeni  ] President [PER Saleh  ] on September 1 to discuss the proposed [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC MANPADS  ] buyback initiative . 
[PER Saleh  ] welcomed [ORG A/S Bloomfield  ] 's visit and the [MISC MANPADS  ] initiative , describing it as part of continuing [LOC U.S.  ] - [MISC Yemeni  ] joint security efforts in the [LOC Arabian Gulf  ] and the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
[ORG A/S Bloomfield  ] thanked the President for his country 's cooperation and partnership in the [LOC GWOT  ] , emphasizing that [MISC MANPADS  ] in particular pose a grave threat to [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Yemeni  ] global security interests should they fall into terrorist hands . 
[PER Saleh  ] readily agreed , adding " these weapons in the hands of al [PER Qa'ida  ] or [ORG Jihadists  ] threaten [LOC Yemen  ] 's security forces . 
We have to get them off the market . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG A/S Bloomfield  ] outlined the [MISC MANPADS  ] buyback initiative , explaining it was a very specific proposal to purchase and destroy systems collected by the [ORG ROYG  ] . 
In addition to compensation for each system , [LOC U.S.  ] technical training and assistance would be provided to ensure the safety of [MISC MANPADS  ] collection and transportation , and to conduct destruction . 
[ORG A/S Bloomfield  ] stressed that there was a 90-day window in which to buy and destroy current [ORG ROYG  ] illicit stocks , and that while the program did not have a time limit -- the funding was , indeed , finite. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) [PER Saleh  ] told [ORG A/S Bloomfield  ] that the [ORG ROYG  ] was currently in possession of 1435 [ORG MANPADS  ] including 500 he had recently collected from " private people " just prior to his departure to [LOC London  ] for an official visit on September 25 . 
The President made clear that these systems would be offered up for sale and destruction according to the proposed initiative , adding that he estimated there were another 150 - 200 still in private hands which the [ORG ROYG  ] is targeted for collection . 
( Note: On August 31 [ORG A/S Bloomfield  ] viewed 79 recovered [MISC MANPADS  ] stored in a [LOC MOD  ] facility . 
The 1435 appear to be some combination of these 79 , plus the other 1029 emboffs observed in the same facility in 2003 , and a number of other illicit systems we were unaware had been collected . 
We will seek clarification on these numbers from NSB Deputy Director [PER Ammar Saleh  ] . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) President [PER Saleh  ] assured [ORG A/S  ] he was serious about cutting off the possibility of [ORG MANPADS  ] leakage from official stocks . 
He said he had given the order to collect all systems from the [ORG Yemeni Armed Forces  ] in the field and return them to storage immediately . 
[ORG A/S  ] commended the President 's actions to get " these dangerous missiles out of dangerous hands , " emphasizing that [MISC Yemeni  ] [ORG MANPADS  ] must remain under the lock and key of the authorities . 
" Actually , " [PER Saleh  ] responded , " we don't need them . 
" -------------------------------- [PER Saleh  ] Promises No New MANPADS... -------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Saleh  ] pledged to [ORG A/S Bloomfield that Yemen  ] 's national defense did not require [ORG MANPADS  ] ; to the contrary , the current crisis in Sa 'd a proves " it was a big mistake " to allow such weapons to fall into the hands of our enemies where they can be used against our own forces . 
" I assure you , " said the President , " there will be no new deals , we will not trade in them . 
" [ORG Bloomfield  ] responded , " you have made a very important statement , that [ORG MANPADS  ] are more useful to terrorists than to your military . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) [ORG A/S  ] told [PER Saleh  ] he is engaged in ongoing discussions with source country governments in [ORG Eastern Europe  ] to stop exporting [ORG MANPADS  ] , but that we have indications arms dealers claiming to represent [LOC Yemen  ] continue to shop in these markets for advanced [ORG MANPADS  ] . 
[PER Saleh  ] advised , " You cannot prevent ( [LOC North  ] ) [LOC Korea  ] , [LOC China  ] , [LOC Ukraine  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , or [LOC Belarus  ] from producing or selling weapons . 
I do not believe you will be successful . 
" " Although , " he continued , " maybe you can convince them to sell through official government contracts and not through brokers . 
" [ORG A/S Bloomfield  ] agreed that controlling weapons production was not easy , but explained that arms firms in nations working with the [LOC U.S.  ] to limit production of [ORG MANPADS  ] report that [LOC Yemen  ] remains a potential client . 
" No , " replied [PER Saleh  ] , we do not need them . 
" <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) [ORG A/S Bloomfield  ] asked the President " if our friends in [ORG Eastern Europe  ] tell me they have a contract with [LOC Yemen  ] , may I tell them 'no , you do not' " ? 
. 
[PER Saleh  ] replied . 
" yes , tell them the contract is canceled -- stop it -- no one has a deal to sell such weapons to [LOC Yemen  ] unless they talk to me . 
" [ORG A/S  ] replied that [PER Saleh  ] 's pledge not to acquire new [ORG MANPADS  ] should not be underestimated , as it would enhance [LOC Yemen  ] 's reputation in [LOC Washington  ] and the international community. -------------------------------------- ...In Exchange for One [ORG Million Dollars  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) " Rest assured , " [PER Saleh  ] continued , " [LOC Yemen  ] will not have such weapons anymore , but everything has a price . 
You will have to pay...one million dollars for each strela ! 
" ( Note: After an awkward silence , [PER Saleh  ] laughed , indicated he was exaggerating , and promised the price would come down . 
In fear some uncertainty remained , the [MISC Palace  ] translator turned to [ORG A/S  ] saying , " I feel it is my duty to make sure you understand this is a joke . 
" End Note . 
) " How much are you willing to pay ? 
" pressed the President . 
[ORG A/S  ] responded that that the price for each [ORG MANPAD  ] was fixed and not negotiable . 
" Fixed , but well above what we believe to be the market price . 
" --------------------------- Al-Houthi - Lessons Learned --------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) [PER Saleh  ] told [ORG A/S  ] that the recent events in Sa 'd a , ( where [ORG ROYG  ] forces are embroiled in an increasingly bloody fight against the well-equipped supporters of rebel Shi'ite cleric al-Houthi ) has proven that it was a " big mistake " to allow these weapons to reach enemy hands . 
[PER Saleh  ] reported to [ORG A/S  ] that 250 soldiers had been killed and 1000-1500 injured in addition to 300-350 rebels . 
( Note: Post believes the number of [ORG ROYG  ] casualties to be much higher . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S ) [ORG A/S Bloomfield  ] replied that the [LOC U.S.  ] was aware of the cost to [LOC Yemen  ] of the recent fighting and that " this hurts us too . 
" [ORG A/S  ] told [PER Saleh  ] that the Embassy is looking to see how else we can help. ----------------------- ...And the [ORG Kitchen Sink  ] ----------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( S ) As expected , [PER Saleh  ] raised extending the buyback to include other types of weapons . 
He reported that the [ORG ROYG  ] has been buying back all types from the grey market since 9/11 , including [MISC SA-2  ] and [MISC SA-3  ] surface-to-air missiles , machine-guns , anti-tank missiles , mines , RPGs , and explosives . 
" We have already paid 9 billion rials ( approximately 49 million USD ) to keep these weapons out of al [MISC Qa'ida  ] hands , " claimed the President we are ready to destroy them . 
We hope you will not limit the program to [ORG MANPADS  ] . 
" ( Note: the [ORG ROYG  ] claims it has collected 32 million USD in assorted [ORG SW/LA  ] and is seeking to recover this expense . 
Although we doubt the claim of 32 million , we understand from [LOC MOD  ] and NSB contacts that the [ORG ROYG  ] has yet to reimburse the arms dealers it contracted to collect these weapons and Minister of [ORG Defense Alaiwa  ] is under considerable pressure to make good on the deal . 
End Note . 
) ---------------------------- [ORG Inventory Control Assistance  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( S ) [ORG A/S  ] emphasized that the program on the table is urgent and specific ; it targets several countries with large numbers of these dangerous systems . 
He stressed that the current proposal is for [ORG MANPADS  ] only , and he is offering to buy them for significantly more than market price . 
" We hope that this important first step will be completed as soon as possible , " said [ORG A/S  ] , adding , that he was prepared to explore ways the [LOC U.S.  ] can assist the [ORG ROYG  ] in controlling its official stocks such as providing inventory controls , computer systems , stockpile security , and training . 
[PER Saleh  ] replied that he looked forward to learning the details of this assistance. ----------------------- Give Us Our [ORG Spare Parts  ] ----------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER Saleh  ] complained to [ORG A/S  ] of ongoing licensing difficulties which had grounded [MISC F-5  ] 's , and [LOC Augusta  ] helicopters , and rendered [ORG M-60 Tanks  ] and [MISC M109  ] artillery inoperable . 
" We have made request after request , " he said , " Why doesn't the [LOC U.S.  ] respond ? 
" The President repeated a common theme , telling [ORG A/S Bloomfield  ] that he pays a high political price in the region and internally for his CT cooperation with the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" Our cooperation " he said will be commensurate with yours , " As much as you move , we will move . 
" <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( S ) [ORG A/S Bloomfield  ] responded that the [ORG USG  ] appreciates its cooperative relationship with [LOC Yemen  ] in the [LOC GWOT  ] , and pointed out that , " as a demonstration of our trust , yesterday I gave Military Chief of [LOC Staff Qassemi  ] a [MISC C-130  ] licensing agreement . 
" " No , interrupted [PER Saleh  ] , " that is a transport plane . 
We need our [MISC F-5  ] in Sa 'd a . 
" [ORG A/S  ] assured the President that he would personally look at each [MISC Yemeni  ] licensing request when he returned to [LOC Washington  ] and would make sure that they received full consideration . 
( Note: When [ORG A/S Bloomfield  ] handed the [MISC C-130  ] license to Chief of [LOC Staff Qassemi  ] on August 31 , the General said sarcastically " these few parts to a transport plane represent the biggest step forward in our military to military cooperation in years . 
" End Note . 
) ------------------------------ Comment: " What , Won't Haggle ? 
" ------------------------------ <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( S ) All joking aside , [PER Saleh  ] appears serious in trying to push up the price per system . 
It is hard to imagine a shrewd operator like the President paying more than market price for [ORG Strela  ] 2 's , approximately 2000 USD . 
It would be true to style for [PER Saleh  ] to try to extract as much possible from the [ORG USG  ] in exchange for his security cooperation . 
On the margins of the meeting , NSB Deputy Director , and [PER Saleh  ] 's nephew , [PER Ammar Saleh  ] recommended [ORG A/S Bloomfield  ] send the President a follow-up letter to our meeting listing other benefits to [LOC Yemen  ] that may result from the agreement , and urging him not to break the deal over prices that cannot/will not change .
