( U ) This is an action message . 
Please see paragraph 3. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Summary . 
Missions should be prepared to assist the [ORG U.S. Delegation  ] to the [ORG Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  ] ( [ORG IPCC  ] ) in its efforts to secure a positive outcome to elections for working group co-chair positions at the [ORG IPCC  ] Plenary being held in [LOC Geneva  ] , August 31-September 4 . 
[ORG USDEL  ] is working actively to prevent the election of an [MISC Iranian  ] scientist to the developing-nation co-chairmanship of [ORG Working Group Two  ] , a position which would pair him with a [LOC U.S.  ] scientist running unopposed for developed-nation co-chair of the same group . 
The focus of [ORG USG  ] efforts is to support an alternate candidacy for the position , although the full slate of active candidates and their potential for election will not be known until the later stages of the plenary sessions . 
Curricula vitae of some of the leading candidates are at paras 6-10 . 
End Summary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Action Request . 
Missions should assign a Point-of-Contact for this issue and provide phone and e-mail information to the [ORG US Mission  ] to the [ORG UN  ] in [LOC Geneva  ] . 
USUN should appoint its own [ORG POC  ] and relay contact information for all [MISC POCs  ] to [ORG USDEL  ] [ORG IPCC  ] . 
In the event that [ORG USDEL  ] requires assistance in working with counterpart delegations ( e.g. , coming to a consensus on a single strong alternate candidate to support ) , [ORG USDEL  ] may contact Mission [MISC POCs  ] directly , or via [ORG US Mission Geneva  ] , to ask that Missions apprise host governments of the situation , with a view to arranging for instructions from capitals . 
Missions should do everything possible to assist [ORG USDEL  ] if they receive such a request . 
Until such a call is received , however , Missions should take no action on this issue ; [ORG USDEL  ] will be interacting directly with host-country expert delegations in [LOC Geneva  ] , and premature contacts/demarches with host country government officials in capitals , even to preview the background of the situation , could be highly counter-productive . 
Point of Contact for [ORG USDEL  ] is OES/EGC , [LOC XXXXXXXXXXXX.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Background . 
The [ORG Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  ] ( [ORG IPCC  ] ) ( http://www.ipcc.ch ) is a highly influential body established by the [ORG World Meteological Organization  ] ( [ORG WMO  ] ) and the [ORG United Nations Environment Program  ] ( [ORG UNEP  ] ) to assess scientific issues related to climate change . 
This year , the [LOC U.S.  ] has nominated [PER Stanford Professor Christopher Field  ] to the developed-country chair of [ORG IPCC Working Group Two  ] , which assesses the vulnerability of socio-economic and natural systems to climate change and the options for adaptation . 
His nomination is unopposed . 
[LOC Iran  ] , however , has nominated Dr. [PER Mostafa Jafari  ] to be the developing-country co-chair of the same working group . 
[PER Jafari  ] is a highly-qualified scientist with research ties to the [LOC UK  ] and [LOC Japan  ] , but he is also a senior [MISC Iranian  ] government employee who has represented [LOC Iran  ] in international negotiations . 
Co-chair appointments are for a minimum of four years , and require close collaboration and often travel to or extended residencies in each others , countries . 
Having [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Iranian  ] co-chairs would be problematic and potentially at odds with overall [LOC U.S.  ] policy towards [LOC Iran  ] , and would significantly complicate the [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to funding the [ORG Working Group  ] Two secretariat . 
[LOC U.S.  ] withdrawal of its nominee , however , would effectively give [LOC Iran  ] a veto over future [LOC U.S.  ] nominees in [ORG UN  ] bodies . 
Moreover , having a [LOC U.S.  ] co-chair at the [ORG IPCC  ] significantly bolsters [LOC U.S.  ] interests on climate change , a key foreign policy issue. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Background continued . 
Prior to arrival in [LOC Geneva  ] , [ORG USDEL  ] contacted [ORG IPCC  ] Chairman Dr. [PER Rajendra Pachauri  ] ( please protect ) , who agreed to work on this issue to avoid the potential for disruption to one the organization , s three core working groups [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
Next , [ORG USDEL  ] contacted the [MISC Austrian  ] delegate serving as [ORG EU  ] representative on the nominating committee that manages the election process , who showed an understanding of [LOC U.S.  ] equities . 
[ORG USDEL  ] contacted the [MISC Malian  ] and [MISC Argentinean  ] delegations , who have nominated highly-qualified co-chair candidates ( see below ) , and the [MISC German  ] delegation , who have been interested in advancing the [MISC Malian  ] for co-chair of [ORG Working Group  ] Three , for which [LOC Germany  ] has nominated an unopposed candidate as developed-country co-chair . 
The [MISC Malians  ] subsequently told [ORG USDEL  ] that their candidate , Dr. [PER Yauba Sokona  ] , prefers [ORG Working Group  ] Two to [ORG Working Group  ] Three . 
Also prior to arrival in [LOC Geneva  ] , [ORG USDEL  ] contacted the [LOC UK  ] and [LOC Netherlands  ] delegations , both of which we have worked closely with in the past . 
Based on experience at prior [ORG IPCC  ] plenaries , events related to the [ORG Working Group  ] elections will likely unfold unpredictably and rapidly , necessitating a rapid and flexible [ORG USG  ] response. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 .
