( S ) SUMMARY . 
Per ref a , Post is engaged with the [MISC Brazilian  ] government to assess [LOC Brazil  ] 's safety procedures concerning its [ORG Air Bridge Denial  ] ( [ORG ABD  ] ) program , in order to make the annual [MISC Presidential Determination  ] ( [ORG PD  ] ) . 
Based on regular contacts with the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Defense Ministry  ] and air traffic control facilities , post believes that [LOC Brazil  ] 's safety procedures remain strong , and we will have as good a basis for certification as we have had in previous years . 
Despite the difficulties presented by the [ORG Department 's  ] need for over two months to compile the information collected , Post is actively engaged in fulfilling the steps requested reftel a . 
However , [MISC Brazilian  ] authorities considers any effort by an outside government to exercise " oversight " of a [MISC Brazilian  ] government program to be a violation of national sovereignty , and are particularly sensitive with regard to aviation matters . 
Post is concerned that the new and increased demands we are requested to make of the [ORG GOB  ] , which now go well beyond what was agreed in the 2004 exchange of notes , present insurmountable and unnecessary obstacles to recertification . 
The steps outlined in ref a effectively require us to second-guess [ORG GOB  ] assurances regarding the safety of their [ORG ABD  ] procedures , which we do not believe is warranted on the basis of what we already know about [LOC Brazil  ] 's intentions and efforts with regard to its [ORG ABD  ] program . 
Mission and [ORG Bureau  ] plans place a priority on improving cooperation with [LOC Brazil  ] , especially in the area of counternarcotics and political-military affairs . 
In the absence of strong evidence that [MISC Brazilian  ] safety procedures have deteriorated refusal to certify will have a significant negative impact on our ability to achieve this objective . 
Post proposes several measures ( see paragraph 5 below ) that would serve to improve [ORG USG  ] oversight as required by last year , s interagency document and increase the [ORG Department  ] 's confidence in [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG ABD  ] program . 
END SUMMARY <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) Post has been active in working the issues raised in ref a with the [MISC Brazilian  ] government , including through contacts with [MISC Brazilian  ] air traffic control and the [ORG Defense Ministry  ] . 
In the four years since the exchange of notes , there has been no basis to believe that the [ORG ABD  ] program has increased risks to civilian aircraft and considerable evidence of [ORG ABD  ] 's efficacy in allowing [MISC Brazilian  ] authorities to enhance their ability to stop shipments of narcotics through [MISC Brazilian  ] airspace . 
There is nothing to suggest that , once we complete this year 's consultations with the [ORG GOB  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] 's safety procedures will be found weaker than in previous years when we have been able to certify . 
Indeed , following the appointment of [PER Nelson Jobim  ] as Defense Minister last year , [LOC Brazil  ] has focused on improving its air traffic control system and its cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] As a result , we expect to provide a recommendation that the [ORG PD  ] should be renewed for 2008-2009. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) With no evidence that [LOC Brazil  ] 's safety procedures have worsened , we believe this is the wrong time to increase [ORG USG  ] requirements for certification . 
Our bottom line should be that if [LOC Brazil  ] can provide the same level of assurance about its [ORG ABD  ] program as in the past , we should be able to make the same determination we have in the past . 
Managing the political and public diplomacy fallout of non-certification would be a significant challenge , as [MISC Brazilians  ] would consider us to be punishing [LOC Brazil  ] for maintaining the same level of control that we were able to certify in the past . 
Failing to certify under present conditions would be seen as a rebuke to [PER DefMin Jobim  ] , one of the strongest supporters of an improved relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] , and would jeopardize information sharing that is becoming increasingly important to counternarcotics activities , damaging our own interests in restricting the traffic of illegal drugs . 
Our interest in increasing sharing of information under a [ORG GSOMIA  ] ( agreed as a priority by Minister [PER Jobim  ] and [PER Secretaries Rice  ] and [ORG Gates  ] ) would likely be affected , as well as our interest in signing a [ORG Defense Cooperation Agreement  ] , undermining key elements of our plan to advance pol-mil enagement with [LOC Brazil  ] , as tasked in ref c . 
Moreover , failure to certify [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG ABD  ] program would belie in a tangible way the message the President , Secretary and Ambassador have repeatedly conveyed to [ORG GOB  ] officials: that the [ORG USG  ] views [LOC Brazil  ] as a valued and trusted partner on military , security , and law enforcement matters. ------------------- Specific Challenges ------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) The main challenge post faced in 2007 was the difficulty of arranging visits to air traffic control facilities . 
Sensitivities remain high with regard to access by non-Brazilian and [MISC Brazilian  ] non-military personnel to military air bases . 
Raising the profile of our oversight efforts would be counter-productive and would likely lead to greater restrictions on our ability to meet certification criteria . 
Nonetheless , with the cooperation of our [ORG DAO  ] and [ORG MLO  ] , we are developing a plan for conducting such visits as prioritized in ref a during the [MISC June-July  ] timeframe in the context of other contacts with the air traffic control facilities . 
The key aspect of post 's plan is to make such visits in the context of other contacts , as recommended in reftels . 
Because gaining access to these facilities in this manner is difficult , meeting the ref a target of all four CINDACTAs by July 31 may prove impossible . 
It should be noted that [MISC Brazilian  ] air traffic controllers are all employed by the military ; there are no civilian air traffic controllers . 
Controllers of civilian traffic have no authority to influence potential shoot downs . 
As a result , military controllers responsible for monitoring civilian aircraft will be the subject of post 's visits . 
Post agrees that it would be ideal to observe a real time interception but notes that doing so in 2007 was a matter of serendipity not likely to be repeated . 
Post will inquire as to the possibility of seeing a simulation. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) At this time , we do not believe there would be any advantage to trying to negotiate an addendum to the 2004 exchange of notes . 
As stated above , raising the profile of our oversight effort would be counter-productive . 
While we may be able to begin a negotiation process this year , it is unclear if such a process could be ever concluded successfully , certainly not in time for this year 's certification deadline . 
Additionally , [LOC Brazil  ] would consider any effort by an outside government to exercise " oversight " of any [MISC Brazilian  ] government function or program to be a violation of national sovereignty and would be considered illegal . 
Any contact with the [MISC Brazilians  ] ostensibly aimed at " oversight " will be summarily denied. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) That said , we believe there is some scope to enhance our confidence in [LOC Brazil  ] 's implementation in light of the 2007 interagency document requesting greater oversight without crossing [MISC Brazilian  ] redlines . 
We propose several possible steps: -- At the heart of the case for requiring annual certification is uncertainty over [LOC Brazil  ] 's precise procedures . 
Ref a clearly states the problem is that " the [ORG USG  ] has no direct knowledge of [MISC Brazilian  ] procedures . 
" We believe it may be possible to approach [LOC Brazil  ] to provide such procedures in writing , provided it is done in the context of an information exchange , i.e. sharing best practices on [ORG Air Traffic Control  ] , and not as a unilateral demand for [LOC U.S.  ] oversight . 
As we have been able to certify in the past without being provided with this , it need not be an absolute condition for certification in the future , but could help considerably in making such determinations . 
-- In order to encourage sharing of precise policy and procedures , we should be prepared to offer [LOC Brazil  ] some incentive to provide its procedures . 
For example , as long as adequate procedures are in place , and confirmed by an annual visit to [PER Comdabra  ] , we should take any steps possible to make the annual certification process a routine one . 
-- The Department should consider supplementing the information we develop from visiting [PER Comdabra  ] and other facilities by tasking [LOC U.S.  ] intel agencies to focus collection efforts on [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG ABD  ] program , particularly signs that shootdown controls are being relaxed . 
This is consistent with [ORG USG  ] views that national technical means often provide effective verification . 
-- The Department should consider funding travel of [MISC Brazilian  ] air traffic controllers to the [LOC U.S.  ] for exchange visits to [LOC U.S.  ] facilities . 
This would help us argue that the [ORG GOB  ] should be more open to us visiting their facilities . 
It would also provide the opportunity to question the [MISC Brazilian  ] controllers on their safety procedures while away from their government 's sovereignty concerns .
