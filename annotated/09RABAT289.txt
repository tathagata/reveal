( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary: [LOC Morocco  ] broke diplomatic relations with [LOC Iran  ] and began a campaign against its domestic [LOC Shi'a  ] minority at [LOC Saudi Arabian  ] instigation , according to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [LOC Tehran  ] had been using [LOC Morocco  ] and its Embassy in [LOC Rabat  ] for activities in [LOC Mali  ] and [LOC Senegal  ] . 
Domestically , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] emphasized that the anti-Shi'a campaign was aimed at neutralizing possible challenges to monarchist parties by [MISC Islamic  ] groups in upcoming municipal elections . 
In addition , King [PER Mohammed VI  ] was seeking to reassert his position as a religious leader . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [LOC Morocco  ] broke relations with [LOC Iran  ] and began a campaign against its domestic [LOC Shi'a  ] minority at [LOC Saudi Arabian  ] instigation , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [PER PolOff  ] on March 30 . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was aware his comments would be reported . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said there was almost daily contact between [PER Mohammed VI  ] 's palace and [LOC Riyadh  ] in the run up to the surprise March 6 severing of [MISC Moroccan  ] relations with [LOC Iran  ] ( Ref A-D ) ; and the intense consultations have continued ( Note: He did not provide a source or basis for this comment other than to say " our information shows . 
" End Note . 
) . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believes that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] has enlisted King [PER Mohammed VI  ] personally ( and not the Government of [LOC Morocco  ] , which was as surprised as the rest of the world at the rupture , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted ) in its geopolitical strategy to counter [MISC Iranian  ] influence . 
In return for active [MISC Moroccan  ] support , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] will ensure a continued flow of subsidized oil to [LOC Morocco  ] , and may plug holes in [LOC Morocco  ] 's foreign direct investment balance sheet resulting from recent [LOC Gulf  ] withdrawals from major projects as a result of the global financial crisis. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said goading [LOC Iran  ] , a country with which it had limited economic interests , and demonizing the [LOC Shi'a  ] , a powerless minority group , was a small price for [LOC Morocco  ] to pay for a strategy that could have major payoffs . 
He added that the King was " killing several birds with one stone " with his actions , and was also seeking to reassert his position as Commander of the Faithful ( Note: Supreme religious leader for the [MISC Moroccan  ] Malachite branch of [PER Sunni Islam  ] . 
End Note . 
) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [LOC Iran  ] has sought to increase the influence of [LOC Shi'ism  ] in [LOC West Africa  ] , where [LOC Tehran  ] had been using [LOC Morocco  ] ( which is a regional air hub ) and its Embassy in [LOC Rabat  ] as a jumping off point for activities in [LOC Mali  ] and [LOC Senegal  ] . 
A former [MISC Iranian  ] ambassador was also apparently travelling to [LOC Tangier  ] , [MISC Tetouan  ] and other cities in [LOC Morocco  ] to lecture and identify promising young religious students from the [LOC Shi'a  ] community for familiarization visits to , and further training in , [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Mohammed VI  ] apparently saw this as a personal affront to him and a direct challenge to his religious and economic authority . 
( Note: Contributions from the wealthy [MISC Tijani  ] sect in [LOC Senegal  ] and [LOC Mali  ] augment Palace coffers . 
Many [MISC Muslims  ] in [LOC West Africa  ] look to the [MISC Moroccan  ] [ORG Monarch  ] as their religious leader . 
End Note ) . 
Although [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] did not provide any basis for the supposition , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believed that [PER Mohammed VI  ] had probably been planning his move for at least a year . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also speculated that the Palace was also worried about the prospect of [MISC Moroccan  ] foreign fighters returning from [LOC Iraq  ] , possibly having been recruited and trained by [LOC Iran  ] , and slipping into [MISC Iranian  ] networks in [LOC Morocco.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Domestically , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] emphasized that the anti-Shi'a campaign was also directed at dissident [MISC Islamic  ] group [ORG Adl Wa Ihsane  ] ( The [MISC Justice  ] and [ORG Good Works Organization  ] ) which has recently signaled its desire to become a legitimate political party . 
The group , which has at times called for the abolishment of the monarchy and the establishment of an [MISC Islamic  ] republic , is believed to have wide popularity among poor and middle class populations unhappy with the political system , which they view as corrupt . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that the Palace is trying to be " more conservative than the fundamentalists " in a bid to neutralize their drawing power. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) On the [LOC Doha  ] conference ( Ref E and F ) , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said RABAT 00000289 002 OF 002 the King 's dithering about whether he would or would not attend was a sign of the difficult balancing act he was attempting to carry off by keeping [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] happy , while not alienating [LOC Qatar  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that by sending his brother [PER Moulay Rachid  ] to the summit , despite his own last minute withdrawal , [PER Mohammed VI  ] showed respect to the Qataris while not enthusiastically endorsing their leadership bid . 
Had he sent someone of lower stature , such as the Prime Minister , it might have been read as a snub , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] explained .
