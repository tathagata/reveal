<code><pre>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 04 [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 000680 SIPDIS DEPARTMENT FOR S , AF/SPG , NEA/MAG EO 12958 DECL: 8/28/2018 TAGS OVIP , [LOC PGOV  ] , [LOC PREL  ] , [LOC PHUM  ] , [LOC ECON  ] , [LOC KDEM  ] , [LOC PTER  ] , [LOC KISL  ] , [LOC AU  ] , [LOC SU  ] , [LOC LY  ] , AG , [LOC TS  ] , [ORG MO SUBJECT:  ] SCENESETTER FOR SECRETARY RICE’S VISIT TO [LOC LIBYA  ] CLASSIFIED BY: [PER Chris Stevens  ] , [LOC CDA  ] , [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy - [LOC Tripoli  ] , Dept of State . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Embassy [LOC Tripoli  ] and the Government of [LOC Libya  ] are looking forward to your historic visit to [LOC Tripoli  ] September 5 . 
Coming on the heels of [ORG NEA A/S Welch’s  ] successful finalization of a comprehensive claims settlement agreement in [LOC Tripoli  ] August 14 , the [ORG GOL  ] views your visit as a signature event in its decade-long effort to achieve reintegration into the international community , and as a tangible benefit of its strategic decision in 2003 to abandon its WMD programs and renounce terrorism . 
Key issues for your visit include: -- Internal political issues -- Bilateral relations -- Human rights -- [MISC Counter-terrorism  ] cooperation -- [LOC Sub-Saharan Africa  ] -- [ORG Regional  ] issues , including [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Iran  ] -- Energy sector and commercial opportunities INTERNAL POLITICAL ISSUES <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Your visit comes days after the 39th anniversary of the September 1 , 1969 military coup that brought [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] to power . 
It is expected that al-Qadhafi will outline in his [ORG Revolution Day  ] speech how the [ORG GOL  ] will implement dramatic government restructuring and privatization he advocated in a key address in March . 
Al-Qadhafi’s plan could represent his most radical experiment in governance since the late 1970’s . 
Ordinary [MISC Libyans  ] are concerned about the rising costs of food , fuel and other staples ; privatization would strike a direct blow at the tacit pact - oil revenue-financed , cradle-to-grave subsidies in exchange for political quiescence - that has underpinned the regime for decades . 
Drawing a line between reform and greater participation by [MISC Libyans  ] in governance , [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi , [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi’s son and heir apparent , called for a more robust civil society , judicial reform , greater press freedoms and respect for human rights in a major speech August 20 . 
A new legal code , which would be the first major change to [MISC Libya’s  ] judicial system since the 1950’s , is currently under review . 
[PER Saif  ] al-Islam implicitly criticized past decisions of his father’s regime , claimed he had achieved much of his own reform agenda and said he would withdraw from politics to focus on civil society and development work . 
Expected to clarify government reform efforts and his own political future , [PER Saif  ] al-Islam’s speech has instead confused [MISC Libyans  ] , raising doubts about the long-term viability of the reform agenda and calling into question whether he is ready for a formal leadership role . 
The issue of who might succeed [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] looms large . 
The conventional wisdom is that it is [PER Saif  ] al-Islam’s job to lose ; however , some observers interpreted the appointment of another son , [PER Muatassim al-Qadhafi  ] , to the newly-created position of [ORG National Security Adviser  ] in early 2007 as a sign that [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] was hedging his bet . 
BILATERAL RELATIONS <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Your visit - the first by a [LOC U.S.  ] Secretary of State since [PER John Foster Dulles’  ] trip in 1953 and the most recent Cabinet-level visit since then-Vice President [PER Nixon  ] was here in 1957 - is viewed as the key component of a “grand opening” in [MISC U.S.-Libyan  ] bilateral relations , as compared to the “soft opening” between re-establishment of diplomatic ties and finalization of the claims agreement ( i.e. , 2004-2008 ) . 
The [ORG GOL  ] also wants to see a fully-accredited [LOC U.S.  ] ambassador posted to [LOC Tripoli  ] and full visa services at the Embassy . 
The fact that most [MISC Libyans  ] must currently travel to [LOC Tunis  ] to apply for non-immigrant visas ( the [MISC Embassy’s  ] security posture/infrastructure have not permitted broader visa operations to date ) is perceived as a slight . 
Anxious to avoid the public perception that [MISC U.S.-Libya  ] ties are chiefly about counter-terrorism cooperation , prospective military-to-military ties and hydrocarbon resources , the [ORG GOL  ] is keen to emphasize cooperation in education ( it wants to send more students to study in the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) , science and technology and culture . 
The [ORG GOL  ] wants to be able to purchase lethal military equipment and would like to sign a civilian nuclear cooperation agreement . 
Despite high-level rhetoric , limited [ORG GOL  ] capacity will significantly constrain efforts to quickly expand bilateral cooperation and engagement in all these areas. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [MISC Libyan  ] reaction to news of the recently finalized [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000680 002 OF 004 [MISC U.S.-Libya  ] claims settlement agreement has been a mixture of relief and high expectation . 
Coverage in state-owned media has been positive , but muted ; we’re told the [ORG GOL  ] did not publicly trumpet the agreement to avoid questions about the deal’s parameters ( it has not publicized the agreed amount of compensation to be distributed by the humanitarian fund ) and to avoid criticism that it capitulated to [LOC U.S.  ] demands . 
A recent editorial in the “Ouea” newspaper , owned by [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi , expressed cautious optimism that bilateral relations had turned a corner and welcomed [LOC U.S.  ] assistance in education and technology transfers , but squarely blamed the [LOC U.S.  ] for past contretemps and cautioned against [LOC U.S.  ] “interference” in [MISC Libyan  ] internal affairs . 
[LOC Libya  ] has balanced re-engagement with us by actively pursuing closer ties with [LOC Russia  ] . 
Then-president [PER Putin  ] visited in March and resolved a thorny [MISC Soviet-era  ] debt issue that paved the way for lucrative commercial contracts ; he is expected to send his deputy to attend the September 1 [ORG Revolution Day  ] festivities . 
In recent remarks , [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi described [LOC Russia  ] as “a key strategic partner” and said the [ORG GOL  ] would support [LOC Russia  ] in its position on [LOC Georgia  ] . 
[LOC Libya  ] is conflicted about re-engagement with the [LOC U.S.  ] Conservative regime elements are still wary that our ultimate goal is regime change , while ordinary [MISC Libyans  ] are genuinely pleased that a key political irritant in the bilateral relationship has been resolved . 
Many hope that expanded political and economic engagement with the [LOC U.S.  ] will help solidify recent [MISC Libyan  ] economic reforms . 
HUMAN RIGHTS & POLITICAL FREEDOMS <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) There are high expectations in some quarters that the [LOC U.S.  ] will pressure al-Qadhafi and the [ORG GOL  ] more publicly and directly to urge greater respect for human rights and open further political space in what remains a closed , tightly-controlled society . 
A number of [MISC Libyans  ] are disappointed that this did not occur immediately after relations were re-established in 2004 . 
The [ORG GOL  ] has expressed tepid interest in a high-level human rights dialogue ; however , they have cautioned that they view discussion of individual cases as improper interference in their internal affairs . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] Absent a clear message that engagement on human rights will be a necessary adjunct of an expanded [MISC U.S.-Libya  ] relationship , meaningful progress in this area is unlikely . 
COUNTER-TERRORISM COOPERATION & EXTREMISM <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [LOC Libya  ] has been a strong partner in the war against terrorism and cooperation in liaison channels is excellent . 
[PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi’s criticism of [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] for perceived support of [MISC Wahabi  ] extremism , a source of continuing [MISC Libya-Saudi  ] tension , reflects broader [MISC Libyan  ] concern about the threat of extremism . 
Worried that fighters returning from [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] could destabilize the regime , the [ORG GOL  ] has aggressively pursued operations to disrupt foreign fighter flows , including more stringent monitoring of air/land ports of entry , and blunt the ideological appeal of radical [MISC Islam  ] . 
The [PER Qadhafi  ] [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000680 003 OF 004 [ORG Development Foundation  ] brokered talks with imprisoned members of the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Islamic Fighting Group  ] ( [ORG LIFG  ] ) that led to the release earlier this year of about 130 former [ORG LIFG  ] members . 
The [ORG GOL  ] considers the program an important means to signal willingness to reconcile with former enemies , a significant feature of [MISC Libya’s  ] tribal culture . 
[LOC Libya  ] cooperates with neighboring states in the [LOC Sahara  ] and [LOC Sahel  ] region to stem foreign fighter flows and travel of trans-national terrorists . 
[PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] recently brokered a widely-publicized agreement with [PER Tuareg  ] tribal leaders from [LOC Libya  ] , [LOC Chad  ] , [LOC Niger  ] , [LOC Mali  ] and [LOC Algeria  ] in which they would abandon separatist aspirations and smuggling ( of weapons and trans-national extremists ) in exchange for development assistance and financial support . 
[LOC Libya  ] also cooperates closely with [LOC Syria  ] , particularly on foreign fighter flows . 
[LOC Syria  ] has transferred over 100 [MISC Libyan  ] foreign fighters to the [MISC GOL’s  ] custody over the past two years , including a tranche of 27 in late 2007 . 
Our assessment is that the flow of foreign fighters from [LOC Libya  ] to [LOC Iraq  ] and the reverse flow of veterans to [LOC Libya  ] has diminished due to the [MISC GOL’s  ] cooperation with other states and new procedures . 
Counter-terrorism cooperation is a key pillar of the [MISC U.S.-Libya  ] bilateral relationship and a shared strategic interest . 
SUB SAHARAN AFRICA <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Having largely abandoned pan-Arab leadership aspirations , the [ORG GOL  ] places a heavy premium on maintaining its perceived role as a leading state in [LOC Africa  ] . 
[LOC Libya  ] spearheaded establishing the Community of [LOC Sahel-Saharan States  ] ( [MISC CEN-SAD  ] ) ; the 10th anniversary of [MISC CEN-SAD’s  ] founding in September 1999 will occur shortly after your visit . 
[LOC Libya  ] is deeply frustrated with its inability to deliver a sustainable peace between [LOC Chad  ] and [LOC Sudan  ] . 
Despite abortive UN/AU-led [ORG Darfur  ] talks in [LOC Libya  ] in October 2007 and the stillborn October 2007 Libya-brokered [LOC Chad  ] cease-fire , the [ORG GOL  ] remains actively involved in [MISC Chad-Sudan  ] mediation efforts ( it played a key role in re-establishing [MISC Chad-Sudan  ] diplomatic relations in July 2008 ) . 
But [LOC Libya  ] recognizes it cannot broker peace unilaterally . 
The [ORG GOL  ] views skeptically calls for an international observer force on the [MISC Chad-Sudan  ] border under the March 2008 Dakar Accord and refers instead to the February 2006 [LOC Tripoli  ] Accords ( which also called for joint military observation of the [MISC Chad-Sudan  ] border ) and the October 2007 Sirte process as the platforms for a viable peace process . 
Hard experience - despite personal appeals by [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi , the [ORG GOL  ] failed to entice [ORG Darfur  ] rebel leaders to attend the October 2007 Sirte conference - has prompted [LOC Libya  ] to realize it is better positioned to pressure the regimes in [LOC Ndjamena  ] and [LOC Khartoum  ] than rebel movements . 
[LOC Libya  ] believes the key to “fixing” [LOC Chad  ] is to pressure Deby to address the deep , popular opposition to his government . 
The [ORG GOL  ] has facilitated humanitarian relief through a key overland corridor running from [LOC Kufra  ] , in southeast [LOC Libya  ] , to [ORG Darfur  ] . 
After years of failed unilateral intervention , [LOC Libya  ] appears to appreciate [MISC UN/AU  ] leadership of the [ORG Darfur  ] political process and [LOC U.S.  ] partnership in efforts to promote peace in and between [LOC Chad  ] and [LOC Sudan  ] . 
A visit by Special [PER Envoy Williamson  ] could help reinvigorate [MISC Libya’s  ] support for stalled international mediation efforts . 
On [LOC AFRICOM  ] , the [ORG GOL  ] has argued that any foreign military presence , regardless of mission , on the [MISC African  ] continent would constitute unacceptable latter-day colonialism and would present an attractive target for al-Qaeda . 
AFRICOM’s Deputy Commander visited [LOC Tripoli  ] for low-key talks in January 2008 and General [PER Ward  ] plans to visit in October/November . 
REGIONAL ISSUES <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [MISC Iraqi  ] spokesman [PER Ali Dabbagh  ] recently met with [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi , who expressed interest in pursuing closer relations with [LOC Iraq  ] . 
It was agreed that a [MISC Libyan  ] delegation would visit [LOC Iraq  ] soon . 
Libyan-Iranian relations are complicated and increasingly contentious . 
[MISC Iranian  ] First Vice President [PER Davoudi  ] , the highest ranking [MISC Iranian  ] official to visit [LOC Tripoli  ] in 25 years , signed a number of cooperation agreements during his January 2008 stop here as part of an apparent effort to garner support in the [ORG UNSC  ] for heading off a third resolution on [MISC Iran’s  ] nuclear activity . 
[LOC Libya  ] wanted [MISC Iran’s  ] help in smoothing over ties with [LOC Lebanon  ] , which have been strained since the disappearance of [PER Imam Musa  ] Sadr during a 1978 visit to [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
[MISC Iran’s  ] decision to demur appears to have factored into [MISC Libya’s  ] decision not to oppose a third [PER UNSCR  ] on [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Al-Qadhafi  ] recently disparaged publicly [MISC Iran’s  ] nuclear aspirations , which prompted an angry rebuke in the [MISC Iranian  ] press . 
Nonetheless , there are concerns about possible ties between state-owned [MISC Libyan  ] banks and [MISC Iranian  ] entities of particular concern . 
Ties with [LOC Syria  ] are less contentious ; [MISC Libya’s  ] new sovereign wealth fund announced last week that it had invested $200 million in a [MISC Syrian  ] cement production venture . 
Claiming that it wants to [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000680 004 OF 004 emulate [LOC Dubai  ] in its development approach , [LOC Libya  ] has recently pursued closer ties with [ORG Arab Gulf  ] states . 
A $500 million joint investment fund was announced during the August 2008 visit of [ORG Oman’s Sultan Qaboos  ] , his first since 1972 . 
A number of similar investment projects have been established with the [LOC UAE  ] , [LOC Qatar  ] and [LOC Bahrain  ] during a flurry of visits over the past year . 
Relations with [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] remain strained . 
ENERGY SECTOR & COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITIES <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [MISC Libya’s  ] economy is almost entirely dependent on oil and gas . 
[LOC Libya  ] has the largest proven oil reserves ( 43.6 billion barrels ) and the third largest proven natural gas reserves ( 1.5 billion cubic meters ) on the [MISC African  ] continent . 
[LOC Libya  ] currently produces about 1.7 million barrels/day of oil ; only [LOC Angola  ] and [LOC Nigeria  ] produce more in [LOC Africa  ] . 
Oil and gas infrastructure suffered during the sanctions period . 
The lifting of sanctions has opened the way for new exploration and improved production . 
New technology and refined management techniques introduced by international oil companies ( IOC’s ) are a key part of [MISC Libya’s  ] plan to increase oil production to 3.0 million barrels/day by 2013 . 
Most of [MISC Libya’s  ] oil and natural gas are exported to [LOC Europe  ] - [LOC Italy  ] , [LOC Germany  ] , [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC France  ] are key customers . 
Major [LOC U.S.  ] energy companies active in [LOC Libya  ] include [ORG Amerada Hess  ] , [ORG ConocoPhillips  ] , [ORG Marathon  ] , [ORG Chevron  ] , [ORG ExxonMobil  ] and [ORG Occidental  ] . 
Joint ventures involving [LOC U.S.  ] companies currently account for about 510,000 barrels/day of [MISC Libya’s  ] 1.7 million barrels/day production . 
A large number of small to mid-sized [LOC U.S.  ] oil and gas services companies are also working in [LOC Libya.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) After years of isolation under sanctions and limited spending by the [ORG GOL  ] , [LOC Libya  ] is currently in the midst of an economic boom , partly driven by a desire to complete large-scale infrastructure projects as tangible symbols of the regime’s achievements in advance of the 40th anniversary of al-Qadhafi’s revolution on September 1 , 2009 . 
High oil prices have helped fuel the outlays . 
[MISC Western  ] companies , eager to establish a position in what is expected to be a lucrative market , are arriving in sizeable numbers . 
A temporary pause prompted by adoption of the [PER Lautenberg Amendment  ] in January 2008 and concern about asset seizure is coming to an end on news of the comprehensive claims agreement . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX Despite great promise , [LOC Libya  ] remains a challenging business and investment environment . 
Contradictory regulations , inefficient government bureaucracy , limited human capacity and rampant corruption ( in 2007 , [ORG Transparency International  ] ranked [LOC Libya  ] 133rd out of 180 countries in terms of being most corrupt ) are significant challenges that could hamper greater investment . 
[MISC AL-QADHAFI  ] & HIS FOREIGN MINISTER <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi is notoriously mercurial . 
He often avoids making eye contact during the initial portion of meetings , and there may be long , uncomfortable periods of silence . 
Alternatively , he can be an engaging and charming interlocutor , as he was during [ORG NEA A/S Welch’s  ] meeting on August 14 . 
A self-styled intellectual and philosopher , he has been eagerly anticipating for several years the opportunity to share with you his views on global affairs . 
We’ve been told that issues he might raise include [LOC Sarkozy’s Union  ] for the [MISC Mediterranean  ] proposal ( which al-Qadhafi opposes ) , the [LOC Georgia  ] conflict , illegal migration ( [LOC Libya  ] is a key transit country ) , [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] and the [MISC Arab-Israeli  ] conflict ( including his “Isratine” one-state solution ) , and [LOC Africa  ] . 
Intellectually curious and a voracious consumer of news - trusted advisers are tasked with summarizing in [MISC Arabic  ] important books and articles printed in other languages , including your recent article in Foreign Affairs - al-Qadhafi will be well-informed and more inclined to focus on strategic views than pragmatic measures . 
Foreign Minister [PER Abdulrahman Shalgham  ] , whom you met in [LOC Washington  ] , is also expected to meet with you during your visit STEVENS</pre></code>
