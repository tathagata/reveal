( [ORG U  ] ) The fourth and most senior suspect in the murder of [LOC US  ] citizen missionary [PER Dorothy Stang  ] turned himself in to [MISC Brazilian  ] federal authorities on March 27 . 
[PER Vitalmiro Bastos Moura  ] ( aka " [PER Bida  ] " ) , 34 , an area rancher who is alleged to have been the mastermind behind [PER Stang  ] 's February 12 murder , surrendered yesterday after weeks of negotiations by his attorney . 
He is the last of four suspects to be arrested . 
The other three ( two gunmen and one middleman ) were all in custody by February 21 . 
[PER Bida  ] insisted on surrendering to federal , rather than state , police . 
He was taken into custody on a roadside near the town of [LOC Altamira  ] , in the rural interior of [LOC Para  ] state , at 12:30pm on March 27 and flown to the state capital of [LOC Belem  ] , where he gave a five-hour statement in the presence of his attorneys , state and federal officials , and federal Senator [PER Ana Julia Carepa  ] , who has followed the case closely. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) After giving his statement , [PER Bida  ] was taken to the auditorium in the Federal Police building where he denied to the gathered press any involvment in [PER Stang  ] 's murder . 
Asked about the two gunmen hiding out on his ranch after the crime , [PER Bida  ] said , " I just told them to get out of there because I didn't want any complications for me " . 
State police supervisor [PER Ualame Machado  ] noted that there is strong evidence against [PER Bida  ] and " now he needs to explain how he could give shelter to the killers for two days and why the gun used in the crime was found on his ranch " . 
As part of his demands for turning himself in , [PER Bida  ] will be held in the Federal Police lockup in [LOC Belem  ] rather than in the state jail with the other three suspects . 
[PER Bida  ] raises cattle on two ranches totalling 3,000 hectares . 
In 2004 , he was described in a report by [ORG INCRA  ] ( the GoB 's agrarian reform agency ) as a " major land thief " . 
After [PER Stang  ] 's murder , [ORG INCRA  ] seized a third ranch he had been using as pasture ( allegedly with a forged title ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The state [ORG Civil Police  ] in [LOC Para  ] have already concluded their investigation into the [PER Stang  ] murder itself and passed their findings to the state prosecutor , recommending indictments against all four suspects for murder with two aggravating circumstances ( financial motivation and the victim 's inability to defend herself ) . 
The two gunmen have confessed their guilt , and have alternately implicated [PER Bida  ] and denied that he was involved . 
But the state police are also conducting a second investigation , still ongoing , into the question of whether [PER Bida  ] was the only mastermind or whether he conspired with other area landowners to raise the promised contract money ( about [MISC US$18,000  ] --which the gunmen never received ) . 
The [ORG Civil Police  ] are scheduled to interview [PER Bida  ] on March 28 on this issue . 
Separately , our contacts among the federal authorities in [LOC Belem  ] say that [PER Bida  ] is prepared to implicate at least two other ranchers in return for leniency , and that he may also accuse the state police of trying to extort money from him . 
[ORG SUPREME COURT  ] TO RULE ON " FEDERALIZATION " ----------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The murder case against the four suspects is proceeding in the [LOC Para  ] state system . 
State prosecutors reportedly plan to try [PER Bida  ] separately so as not to slow down the case against the first three suspects . 
But there are widespread concerns ( reftels ) that the state judicial system is compromised by links to large landowners and that justice will not be realized unless the case is taken over by federal authorities . 
From the beginning , the Federal Police and federal prosecutor 's office have conducted their own investigation parallel to the state case . 
A law passed last December allows the federal government to take over serious human rights cases from the states , and the [PER Stang  ] murder is the trial-run for this law . 
In early March , federal Prosecutor-General [PER Claudio Fontelles  ] filed a petition with the federal [ORG Supreme Justice Court  ] ( [ORG STJ  ] ) asking to federalize the case . 
In order to rule on the petition , the [ORG STJ  ] then requested further information on the case from the [LOC Para  ] state authorities . 
The [ORG STJ  ] received this information last week , and [ORG STJ  ] Judge [PER Arnaldo Esteves  ] indicated last week he is waiting to hear the views of the defendants before the [ORG STJ  ] will decide whether to transfer the case to federal authorities .
