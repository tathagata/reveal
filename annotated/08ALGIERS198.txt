ALGIERS  ] 141 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Robert Ford  ] , reason 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) We and the [MISC Algerians  ] are looking forward to your visit next week . 
There was a prominent article about your visit , generated with help from our [ORG PAO  ] , in best-selling el-Khabar newspaper on February 21 . 
You will be visiting just as the government machine is gearing up to amend the [MISC Algerian  ] constitution to enable President [PER Bouteflika  ] to run for a third term in 2009 . 
There is no strong , influential voice criticizing this effort ; only small parties and a few notable individuals have spoken against the building momentum ( ref A ) . 
The only issue that appears unresolved inside the top civilian and military leadership is whether or not there should be a change to the constitution that establishes a vice president as well . 
This vice president would be the obvious successor to [PER Bouteflika  ] , especially if his health prevents him from serving out a third term that would expire in 2014 . 
We are arranging for you to meet with former Prime Minister [PER Ouyahia  ] , the man most frequently thought to be tapped for vice president . 
AN UNHAPPY COUNTRY ------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) There is much discussion among political circles about the constitution , the third term and the succession issue , but precious little discussion about how to address long-standing political alienation and social discontent throughout the country . 
Housing is woefully short , while unemployment and underemployment are endemic ( at least 50 percent among young people ) . 
In a relatively new phenomenon , many young people are trying to flee the country , by small boat if necessary . 
The average age at which [MISC Algerians  ] marry is now into the mid 30s - a vivid indicator of how unhappy the twenty-somethings are . 
Meanwhile , most world food price hikes are being passed to consumers , resulting in strikes by different labor groups almost weekly ( see ref B for example . 
Notably , while you are here we expect school teachers nationwide to strike ; on the positive side , school closures may ease traffic during your visit , inshallah . 
) Almost daily there are isolated demonstrations with the occasional government office in some distant town attacked . 
Meanwhile , voter turnout for the 2007 legislative and local elections was lower than ever before because Algeria’s young people do not see the political system as having any relevance to addressing their problems . 
This is not the quaking state of the early 1990s . 
The government is firmly entrenched . 
However , much of political and social elite sense that [LOC Algeria  ] is drifting ( see also ref C ) . 
THE VISION THING ---------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) These political , economic and social problems notwithstanding , [LOC Algeria  ] is richer than ever . 
The oil and gas sector is running up record export revenues - [MISC USD  ] 70 billion likely in 2007 , while imports will only be about [MISC USD  ] 45 billion , according to the [ORG IMF  ] . 
As a result , the [ORG GoA  ] is piling up record foreign exchange reserves , now around [MISC USD  ] 110 billion . 
The public knows about the riches and the [MISC GoA’s  ] inability to relieve problems like housing and unemployment hits at the [MISC GoA’s  ] credibility . 
[PER Bouteflika  ] and his team have only one approach to energize the economy: spend tens of billions of dollars on infrastructure as well as some grandiose projects to generate jobs and also create a [PER Bouteflika  ] legacy . 
The construction industry is growing but not as fast as in other oil-boom states . 
Red tape , burdensome regulations and centralization slow project implementation and impede new private investment . 
The [ORG GoA  ] seems incapable of addressing these systemic problems . 
This inability stems from a lack of vision at the top . 
[PER Bouteflika  ] and his team have yet to make a choice on whether [LOC Algeria  ] will be a market-driven economy where [MISC Algerians  ] must integrate into the world economy or an economy whose government still provides the old social contract of the 1960s and 1970s . 
We have small technical assistance projects to help the [ORG GoA  ] reform its financial and education sectors , but bureaucratic ineptitude and a lack of [MISC Algerian  ] urgency slow progress . 
We therefore extract small , new reforms where we can get them . 
( [ORG Treasury DAS McDonald  ] will be here at the same time as you to look at [LOC Treasury-funded  ] assistance [ORG ALGIERS  ] 00000198 002 OF 004 programming . 
) TERRORISM PROBLEM NOT A THREAT TO STABILITY ------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The social discontent enables al-Qaida in the Lands of the [MISC Islamic  ] [ORG Maghreb  ] ( [ORG AQIM  ] ) to find a steady supply of recruits but not enough to threaten stability . 
There are terror-related attacks almost daily now , usually in the mountains east of [LOC Algiers  ] . 
( There are occasional attacks in southern and western [LOC Algeria  ] now too . 
) [ORG AQIM  ] and other [MISC Islamist  ] extremists usually hit [MISC Algerian  ] security forces , but there are regular threats against [MISC Western  ] interests , especially [MISC French  ] and [MISC American  ] . 
The terrorists’ tactics have not much changed except in one important manner: nine suicide car bomb attacks since April 2007 . 
[ORG AQIM  ] can’t threaten the government’s stability but it has hurt the credibility of [LOC Bouteflika’s  ] national amnesty program ; it likely weakened him in internal debates with the [MISC Algerian  ] hard-liners inside the security force leadership . 
It has hurt the credibility of the [MISC Algerian  ] security forces among the [MISC Algerian  ] public and the [MISC Western  ] community here . 
In particular , the December 2007 attack that destroyed the [ORG UN  ] headquarters here deeply embarrassed the [MISC Algerian  ] government . 
When the [ORG UN  ] said it would conduct its own investigation into the security shortcomings before the attack , the hypersensitive [MISC Algerian  ] authorities reacted vehemently and forced the [ORG UN  ] to back down . 
Watching this brittle response , [MISC Western  ] companies and embassies now are jittery . 
Many say that they are watching us for signals on when to send out expatriates . 
[LOC Algiers  ] has seen no incidents since December 11 but there are constant threat reports in sensitive channels . 
COUNTER-TERROR COOPERATION VERY GOOD ------------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) As the [ORG AQIM  ] threat has ratcheted up , we have increased our collaboration with [MISC Algerian  ] military intelligence . 
They are prickly , paranoid group to work with , but with them we have rolled up several networks that sent [MISC Algerian  ] jihadis to [LOC Iraq  ] . 
According to information from an al-Qaida in [LOC Iraq  ] cell , 64 [MISC Algerian  ] fighters reached [LOC Iraq  ] between August 2006 and August 2007 . 
Thus , our collective work is not perfect , but the number of [MISC Algerians  ] fighting in [LOC Iraq  ] likely would have been far higher were we not working closely together . 
We have also helped the [ORG GoA  ] roll up [ORG AQIM  ] networks that were planning attacks inside [LOC Algeria  ] . 
Notably , the [MISC Algerian  ] authorities do not like to discuss our cooperation against [ORG AQIM  ] publicly . 
Instead , they limit themselves to saying that they cooperate with the [LOC U.S.  ] and other nations against international terror networks . 
We have a new [ORG FBI  ] office at the embassy that we hope will establish collaborative programs with the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] , but the [MISC Algerians  ] are not rushing to cooperate . 
MILITARY TO MILITARY: WE MUST BE PATIENT ----------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) While the [MISC Algerians  ] are not rushing to expand our mil-mil relationship. it is slowly growing . 
For the first time in early 2007 the [MISC Algerians  ] themselves proposed some joint activities , and we undertook training exercises here involving the navy and air force . 
AFRICOM has offered much more , but the [MISC Algerians  ] purposely keep a foot on the brake . 
They want to avoid dependence in their military relations , so they spread out activities among foreign partners . 
They have limited administrative capacity , and the officers who work on bilateral activities with [LOC France  ] or [LOC Germany  ] or [LOC Russia  ] are the same ones who work with us . 
They are not good at multi-tasking . 
Part of the [MISC Algerian  ] caution also results from bureaucratic gamesmanship and paranoia . 
In contrast to programming with some other countries , [MISC Algerian  ] military intelligence clears all our bilateral military activities . 
( They likely seek to enhance their own position within the [MISC Algerian  ] power structure by controlling the security relationship with the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) In addition , [ORG GoA  ] security personnel are exceptionally careful in their contacts with foreigners due to their [ORG CI  ] concerns . 
Probably because [MISC Algerian  ] military intelligence was not ready , the [MISC Algerians  ] lost their chance to have a high-level bilateral military committee meeting at the [ORG Pentagon  ] in April 2008 that would have drawn up plans for expanded activities into 2009 . 
Their failure to reserve the April dates probably will push that meeting into the autumn or even to the next administration . 
We warned them clearly but their own system was too sclerotic to respond . 
[ORG ALGIERS  ] 00000198 003 OF 004 REGIONAL POLICIES: FAR APART FROM US ------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Bouteflika  ] is very much his own foreign minister and his thinking about regional politics has evolved little from the 1970s . 
He loyally attends all the [ORG NAM  ] and [ORG African Union  ] summits , and he places huge weight on the [ORG United Nations  ] , liberation ideology and negotiation over use of force ( especially [MISC Western  ] armed forces ) . 
The [MISC Algerians  ] are surprisingly ill informed when events are moving in the region ; they also lack a good grounding in underlying trends in areas like the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
[MISC Arab  ] satellite TV seems to be a big source of their information . 
Hence , you will find that the [MISC Algerians  ] take nettlesome positions on the regional questions of import to us: -- Peace Process: They line up behind the [ORG Arab League  ] consensus , arguing in private that it is hopeless to try to exclude [LOC Syria  ] and [ORG Hamas  ] from the efforts to reach a settlement ( ref D ) . 
They appreciate our pledge to work for a viable [MISC Palestinian  ] state and to achieve short-term , concrete improvements for the [MISC Palestinians  ] . 
So far , we have seen little enthusiasm in response to our demarches for more aid to the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] , but they likely would respond to a strong request from the [ORG Arab League  ] . 
The [MISC Algerian  ] public , particularly the [MISC Islamists  ] , is now less preoccupied with violence in [LOC Algeria  ] and vehemently anti-Israeli . 
The [ORG GoA  ] , therefore , is unlikely to make any unilateral gestures to [LOC Israel  ] . 
-- [ORG Lebanon:  ] The [MISC Algerians  ] back [ORG Arab League  ] efforts and hope for consensus to develop among the [MISC Lebanese  ] factions . 
Their senior [ORG MFA  ] official working [LOC Middle East  ] issues has repeatedly cautioned us against trying to isolate [LOC Syria  ] on [MISC Lebanese  ] issues ( ref E ) . 
Underlining how our efforts complement [ORG Arab League  ] efforts will make the most headway with the [MISC Algerians  ] . 
-- Iraq: President [PER Bouteflika  ] told Senator [PER Nelson  ] last summer that the [LOC U.S.  ] should not withdraw too quickly from [LOC Iraq  ] lest security deteriorate further . 
The [ORG MFA  ] and [MISC Algerian  ] military intelligence have made the same point to us more recently , although publicly the [ORG GoA  ] says little . 
There is an [MISC Iraqi  ] embassy in [LOC Algiers  ] , but relations with the [MISC Iraqi  ] Government are cool . 
The [MISC Algerians  ] have no intention of reopening an embassy in [LOC Baghdad  ] . 
In part , they are still angry about the murder of two of their diplomats in [LOC Baghdad  ] in 2005 . 
Despite their repeated inquiries , they have received no information on who was responsible . 
In addition , public and government distrust of the [MISC Iraqi  ] [ORG Shia  ] makes the [ORG GoA  ] unwilling to take any risks on [LOC Iraq  ] policy . 
Their military intelligence likely would work discretely with [MISC Iraqi  ] intelligence to disrupt al-Qaida activities , but we doubt [MISC Algerian  ] officers would actually go to [LOC Iraq  ] . 
-- Iran: [MISC Algerian  ] officials remember [MISC Iranian  ] support for [MISC Algerian  ] [MISC Islamists  ] in the early 1990s and are suspicious of [LOC Iran’s  ] regional intent . 
President [PER Bouteflika  ] in private has told the [MISC Iranian  ] President to cooperate with the [ORG UN  ] on the nuclear issue . 
The [ORG GoA  ] is also adamant that we should continue on the diplomatic track and recognize even small [MISC Iranian  ] steps when we see them ; they were reluctant to endorse more pressure on [LOC Iran  ] during Ambassador [PER Schulte’s  ] visit here in late November . 
The [MISC Algerian  ] leadership has a bit of sympathy for [ORG Hizballah  ] and [ORG Hamas  ] as liberation fighters , but their heads tell them to be wary . 
Thus , you will hear understanding from them when we warn them of the dangers of these terror groups , but the [MISC Algerians  ] will immediately insist that [LOC Israel  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] have to resolve the [MISC Palestinian  ] and [MISC Lebanese  ] problems . 
Underlining how [ORG Hizballah  ] and [ORG Hamas  ] threaten the very progress on the [MISC Lebanese  ] and [MISC Palestinian  ] issues that the [ORG GoA  ] wants will be the most effective arguments . 
-- [ORG Western Sahara: This  ] is the issue that the [ORG GoA  ] cares the most about and you will likely receive an earful . 
The [ORG GoA  ] still lingers over the hope that the [ORG Baker Plan  ] will come back despite our telling them repeatedly that it is finished . 
The top [MISC Algerian  ] leadership stress that they view a [MISC Saharan  ] referendum on independence as a matter of national liberation as a matter of principle . 
They don’t want to destabilize [LOC Morocco  ] , and they doubt the [LOC Western Sahara  ] is so important to the throne’s hold on power . 
They do not want to start armed hostilities , although we are less sure they would - or could - stop every possible [ORG Polisario  ] provocation . 
The [MISC Algerians  ] likely will try to wait for the end of this [MISC American  ] administration hoping that the next one will be less supportive of the [MISC Moroccan  ] autonomy proposal . 
Explaining the [ORG ALGIERS  ] 00000198 004 OF 004 exhaustion of broad [MISC American  ] patience with the long-standing dispute will be the best way of shaking loose the [MISC Algerian  ] fixation on Baker . 
AND THE GUANTANAMO PROBLEM -------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) For the past two years we have sought [ORG GoA  ] approval for the repatriation of some of the two dozen [MISC Algerians  ] held at the facility . 
During the April 2007 visit of [PER S/WCI Williamson  ] we all agreed on principles to govern the return of [MISC Algerians  ] , but since then the [ORG GoA  ] has refused to agree to accept even a single detainee back despite our repeated attempts . 
We think that President [PER Bouteflika  ] and military intelligence chief LTG Medienne agree that it would be harmful to [LOC Algeria  ] to take any detainees back , and that consensus at the very top makes any movement by lower officials impossible . 
The [ORG GoA  ] has told us we can send detainees back to the countries where we detained them , such as [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
This is a non-starter . 
We need you to explain firmly that the [LOC Guantanamo  ] detainee issue will not go away and probably will become more important in the next year as we move closer to shutting down the detention center at [LOC Guantanamo  ] .
