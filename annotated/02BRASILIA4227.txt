1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY . 
Assistant Secretary [PER Reich  ] had warm and productive meetings in [LOC Brasilia  ] November 20-21 with President-elect [PER Lula  ] da [PER Silva  ] , his senior advisors in the [ORG PT  ] , and [MISC Brazilian  ] congressional leaders . 
Both Ambassador [PER Reich  ] and [PER Lula  ] expressed great interest in working together across a range of issues , particularly trade . 
The [ORG PT  ] team floated the idea of concluding a bilateral trade pact with the [LOC US  ] , but will first consult with their [ORG Mercosul  ] partners and then likely raise some proposals during [PER Lula  ] 's December 10 visit to [LOC Washington  ] . 
[PER Lula  ] is eager to meet President [PER Bush  ] , sure that " two politicians like us will understand each other when we meet face to face . 
" In keeping with efforts by [PER Lula  ] to distance himself from [PER Castro  ] and [PER Hugo Chavez  ] , [ORG PT  ] leader [PER Aloizio Mercadante  ] sought to downplay his participation in the " [LOC Sao Paulo Forum  ] " as an attempt to set a democratic example for other [MISC Latin American  ] leftists . 
Ambassador [PER Reich  ] also met with [MISC Brazilian  ] congressional leaders , who similarly expressed eagerness to strengthen ties with the [LOC US  ] in order to help address pressing economic and social needs . 
END SUMMARY . 
RELATIONSHIP OFF ON THE RIGHT FOOT ---------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) WHA Assistant Secretary [PER Otto Reich  ] led a delegation to [LOC Brasilia  ] November 20-21 that included [MISC WHA/BSC  ] Director [PER James Carragher  ] , [ORG Special Advisor  ] [PER William Perry  ] , and [PER Michael Zarin  ] of [ORG S/P  ] . 
The group , accompanied by Ambassador [PER Hrinak  ] and Poloff ( notetaker ) , met November 21 with President-elect [PER Lula  ] da [PER Silva  ] and his three senior advisors: [PER Jose Dirceu  ] , [ORG Workers' Party  ] ( [ORG PT  ] ) President and [ORG Federal Deputy  ] from [LOC Sao Paulo  ] ; [PER Aloizio Mercadante  ] , [ORG PT  ] Federal Deputy and Senator-elect from [LOC Sao Paulo  ] ; and [PER Antonio Palocci  ] , who resigned this week as mayor of [PER Riberao Preto  ] ( [ORG SP  ] ) to devote full time to leading [PER Lula  ] 's transition team . 
All three will have high profile positions in the new government. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The messages on both sides were extremely positive . 
Before [PER Lula  ] joined the meeting , [PER Jose Dirceu  ] expressed the interest of the incoming government in strengthening Brazil/US ties . 
He said the December 10 visit by [PER Lula  ] to [LOC Washington  ] should focus on items on both countries' agendas , including [ORG FTAA  ] and free trade , protectionism , terrorism , and the possibility of war in [LOC Iraq  ] , which would have economic consequences for [LOC Brazil  ] . 
LET'S GET BEYOND THE HEADLINES ------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Assistant Secretary [PER Reich  ] commented that even after 9/11 the [LOC US  ] will continue to pursue a range of interests ( commercial , economic , political , security ) in the hemisphere . 
President [PER Bush  ] 's phone call to [PER Lula  ] after the [MISC Brazilian  ] elections and invitation to the [LOC White House  ] are strong signals of the [ORG USG  ] 's desire to strengthen ties to [LOC Brazil  ] under [PER Lula  ] . 
The message , [PER Reich  ] emphasized , is that the [LOC US  ] and the incoming [MISC Brazilian  ] government need to get beyond any preconceptions we may have had about each other and focus on things that bring us together . 
The media often highlight policy differences , he added , but it is President [PER Bush  ] who sets the [ORG USG  ] 's direction , and he wants to strengthen the [MISC US/Brazil  ] relationship . 
[PER Reich  ] also reviewed the [LOC US  ] position on [LOC Iraq  ] , noting that there would not have been the current need to force compliance if [PER Saddam Hussein  ] had complied with the sixteen [ORG UN  ] resolutions since 1991 . 
BILATERAL TRADE PACT ON THE HORIZON ? ------------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Commenting on [PER Mercadante  ] 's remark to D/USTR [PER Peter Allgeier  ] the day before that the [LOC US  ] seems unwilling to negotiate a bilateral trade agreement with [LOC Brazil  ] , [PER Reich  ] said the [LOC US  ] was flexible on the best approach to free trade but that his impression was that [LOC Brazil  ] was not interested in such a bilateral pact . 
[PER Mercadante  ] noted that [ORG Mercosul  ] partners [LOC Argentina  ] and [LOC Uruguay  ] are currently in crisis , which has scared foreign investors throughout [LOC South America  ] . 
Thus [LOC Brazil  ] 's two highest priorities with the [LOC US  ] are: obtaining [LOC US  ] support in gaining increased access to commercial credit ( and demonstrating that [LOC Brazil  ] is a better risk than [LOC Argentina  ] ) ; and secondly , to increase foreign trade , and particularly to double trade with the [LOC US  ] in the next four years . 
How , [PER Mercadante  ] asked , can the [MISC US/Brazilian  ] trade total only $30 billion per year ? <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Mercadante  ] urged that the [LOC US  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] sit down to discuss a range of bilateral trade issues , for example , IPR and music piracy , ethanol sales , and aircraft exports . 
He added that [ORG FTAA  ] ( " [MISC ALCA  ] " in [MISC Portuguese  ] ) will be a much more difficult project , but that the bilateral talks could start immediately . 
Reflecting the [ORG PT  ] 's dedication to regional partners , [PER Mercadante  ] urged that the [LOC US  ] seek a trade pact with [ORG Mercosul  ] . 
Ambassador [PER Reich  ] said he was pleased to hear of [PER Mercadante  ] 's interest in such talks , noting that the [LOC US  ] is open to bilateral pacts ( e.g. , [LOC Chile  ] ) as well as pacts with sub-regional groups ( e.g. the [MISC Central American  ] states ) . <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Hrinak  ] asked [PER Mercadante  ] if [PER Lula  ] would be extending an invitation to bilateral talks during the [LOC Washington  ] visit . 
[PER Jose Dirceu  ] answered before [PER Mercadante  ] could , saying that the bilateral talks were important but would have to be approached in the context of [LOC Brazil  ] 's regional commitments . 
[PER Dirceu  ] admitted that the incoming government would like to conclude a bilateral pact quickly , but as [LOC Brazil  ] is the only stable economic force in [LOC South America  ] , they would have to proceed cautiously and in concert with regional partners . 
[PER Mercadante  ] said that [PER Lula  ] will travel to [LOC Argentina  ] on December 3 , and then there will be a December 5-6 meeting of [ORG Mercosul  ] presidents in [LOC Brasilia  ] . 
[PER Lula  ] would use these opportunities to sound out the [ORG Mercosul  ] partners on future negotiating mechanisms --for example a [ORG Mercosul  ] 4 1 with the [LOC US  ] . 
After these talks , [PER Mercadante  ] said , it is possible [PER Lula  ] would arrive in [LOC Washington  ] with " some initiatives " . 
[PER Dirceu  ] summed up by noting that while [LOC Brazil  ] must consult its regional partners , it " does not want to be held hostage by them . 
" [PER LULA  ] WANTS STRONG TIES AND TOUGH NEGOTIATING -------------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) President-elect [PER Lula  ] then joined the meeting and enthusiastically stated his interest in strong bilateral relations across the range of issues . 
That , he said , is what is motivating him to travel to [LOC Washington  ] on December 10 . 
Appearing upbeat , smartly-dressed and rested , [PER Lula  ] expressed hope that after his visit , [LOC US  ] officials will no longer misunderstand the [ORG PT  ] . 
Looking forward to meeting President [PER Bush  ] , he said " I think two politicians like us will understand each other when we meet face to face . 
" [LOC Brazil  ] 's image has suffered in recent years , he said , and the [ORG PT  ] wants to consolidate its democracy and rescue it from the perception that [MISC Brazilian  ] officials are a " bunch of irresponsible thieves " and " [LOC Brazil  ] is another [LOC Colombia  ] . 
" <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The [ORG PT  ] has the sense that [LOC Brazil  ] can play an important role but can only reach its potential in cooperation with the [LOC US  ] . 
In a left jab at the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] , [PER Lula  ] echoed remarks that he has made in public: " I want to do for [MISC Brazilians  ] what you [LOC US  ] diplomats do for your citizens --fight for their interests . 
But I think [MISC Brazilian  ] diplomacy has not been tough enough , not like yours . 
We have sometimes made bad deals . 
" [PER Dirceu  ] added that the [MISC Brazilian  ] government is committed to abiding by all agreements that it inherits , " We do not need any more headaches " that we would get by breaking deals , he said . 
The [ORG PT  ] team has emphasized its interest in negotiating [ORG FTAA  ] with the [LOC US  ] , but doing so by vigorously defending [LOC Brazil  ] 's interests . 
After the meeting , [PER Mercadante  ] told the press . 
" The [MISC Americans  ] always played tough , and now they have a [MISC Brazilian  ] administration that is going to play as tough as they do . 
" " WE ARE NOT AFRAID OF THE [ORG PT  ] " ----------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Reich  ] congratulated [PER Lula  ] on his election victory , adding that his own visit was designed to follow up on President [PER Bush  ] 's post-election phone call and lay the groundwork for the December 10 visit . 
Ambassador [PER Reich  ] expressed support for [PER Lula  ] 's social agenda ( " Your commitment to three meals a day for every [MISC Brazilian  ] is something that all [MISC Americans  ] will want to support . 
" ) , adding that democratization , human rights , economic progress , and transparency are key issues for the [LOC US  ] public and policy makers . 
[PER Reich  ] concluded , " We are not afraid of the [ORG PT  ] and its social agenda " . 
PALOCCI'S ECONOMIC MESSAGE: CREDIT , CREDIT , CREDIT --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) After [PER Lula  ] was called away , Transition Director [PER Antonio Palocci  ] picked up on the economic themes . 
He stated unequivocally that the [ORG PT  ] government will focus on combating inflation and working smoothly with the [MISC IFIs  ] . 
Modifying [PER Mercadante  ] 's two priorities a bit , [PER Palocci  ] said [PER Lula  ] would take two messages to [LOC Washington  ] . 
First , that [LOC Brazil  ] really has three short-term priorities: credit , credit , and credit ; and second , that [LOC Brazil  ] will seek clear understandings and strong relations with the [LOC US  ] in order to develop and grow . 
12 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Reich  ] observed that the [ORG USG  ] does not direct banks to extend credit , but that the [MISC Brazilians  ] themselves were doing the right things to gain access to loans . 
[PER Reich  ] noted that " since the elections you have been sending the right messages " , adding that Brazilian/US cooperation will reinforce these messages by conveying to the financial markets [LOC US  ] confidence in [LOC Brazil  ] 's economy . 
" THE [ORG PT  ] IS A MODEL FOR [MISC LATIN AMERICAN  ] LEFTISTS " --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Reich  ] asked [PER Mercadante  ] about the " [LOC Sao Paulo Forum  ] " , which [PER Mercadante  ] has addressed and which has included [ORG FARC  ] and [MISC Cuban  ] participants , among others . 
[PER Mercadante  ] downplayed the [ORG PT  ] 's work in the [ORG Forum  ] , explaining that his primary interest is in developing the left in [LOC Latin America  ] , and that many of the participants in the [ORG Forum  ] are unreconstructed " outdated " leftists who can learn a lot from the [ORG PT  ] 's democratic model and emphasis on economic development . 
He added that the [ORG Forum  ] had issued a declaration after 9/11 condemning the terrorist attacks and defending the right of the [LOC US  ] to respond in self-defense . 
" We are democratic , " [PER Mercadante  ] assured us , " [LOC Washington  ] needs to hear our ideas and our arguments . 
" 14 . 
( C ) On [LOC Colombia  ] , [PER Dirceu  ] said that the [ORG FARC  ] needs to understand that if they cross into [MISC Brazilian  ] territory , [PER Lula  ] 's government will use the military and " treat them as enemies . 
" He added that groups such as the [ORG FARC  ] that operate outside of democratic processes " do not interest us " . 
After Ambassador [PER Reich  ] outlined the range of human rights concerns in [LOC Cuba  ] , [PER Dirceu  ] responded that " the strongest force in the world for changing [LOC Cuba  ] is [LOC US  ] trade " , but he concluded that " we will simply have to agree to disagree " on [LOC Cuba  ] policy . 
[LOC WASHINGTON  ] AGENDA ----------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER Mercadante  ] said that he will accompany [PER Lula  ] to [LOC Washington  ] . 
The rest of the travel team has not been decided , and the agenda will be finalized only after consultations with the [MISC Brazilian  ] embassy in [LOC Washington  ] , though Ambassador [PER Barbosa  ] has been consulting in [LOC Brasilia  ] this week . 
INAUGURATION LIKELY JANUARY 1 ----------------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) In response to a question from Ambassador [PER Reich  ] , [PER Dirceu  ] stated that the inauguration will be on January 1 . 
( N.b. , [PER Dirceu  ] himself was a big proponent of moving the date to January 6 and had been urging his congressional colleagues to take quick action on the required constitutional amendment , so his statement on the January 1 date may well be the last word . 
) Minister [PER Pedro Parente  ] , head of the outgoing administration 's transition team , also told us November 21 that the inauguration would be January 1 . 
CONGRESSIONAL MEETINGS ---------------------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) Earlier , Ambassador [PER Reich  ] 's group met with outgoing Chamber Speaker and [ORG PSDB  ] leader [PER Aecio Neves  ] and separately with [ORG PT Senate  ] leader [PER Eduardo Suplicy  ] from [LOC Sao Paulo  ] and [ORG PT  ] Deputy [PER Waldir Pires  ] from [LOC Bahia  ] . 
[PER Neves  ] , who will take over as Governor of [LOC Minas Gerais  ] in January , focused his remarks on [LOC Brazil  ] 's economic plight . 
He noted that he had supported the economic plan of President [ORG Cardoso  ] , which had prevented [LOC Brazil  ] from suffering the same fate as [LOC Argentina  ] . 
He also stressed that the [ORG PSDB  ] and other opposition parties expect to support many of [PER Lula  ] 's initiatives . 
[PER Suplicy  ] stressed the importance of President [PER Bush  ] 's understanding the [MISC Brazilian  ] democratic process and the fact that [PER Lula  ] 's 61% electoral support demonstrated that he has overwhelming legitimacy to address social and economic issues . 
Both [PER Suplicy  ] and [PER Pires  ] spoke at length on the importance of addressing [LOC Brazil  ] 's deep social inequities . 
[PER Suplicy  ] added that [PER Lula  ] may be a useful bridge in improving [LOC US  ] relations with [LOC Cuba  ] , to which Ambassador [PER Reich  ] replied that relations will improve as soon as [PER Castro  ] holds free elections . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [PER Lula  ] and the senior [ORG PT  ] officials are clearly eager to get down to work with us , and this visit went a long way toward reassuring them that the feeling is mutual . 
Though they have not yet thought through their floater for bilateral trade talks , we can expect some sort of proposal in [LOC Washington  ] , after they have consulted more deeply with their Mercosul partners as well as internally. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) The [ORG PT  ] leaders have contrasting and complementary personalities . 
[PER Mercadante  ] 's former radicalism lies not far from the surface . 
He speaks to convince rather than explain , often pointing a finger at his listeners . 
Yet he is courteous and clearly focused on specific bilateral projects . 
[PER Dirceu  ] is much smoother . 
He never corrected [PER Mercadante  ] but sometimes stepped in to qualify his remarks . 
[PER Dirceu  ] seems to be the first among equals and is rumored to become [PER Lula  ] 's Chief-of-Staff if he does not stay in [ORG Congress  ] to become the Speaker of the Chamber . 
[PER Palocci  ] , whose star has risen rapidly in recent months , is perhaps the most pragmatic of the group . 
He speaks slowly and calmly --often about economic issues-- clearly aware of the effect of his words . 
His is a voice seemingly designed to reassure the markets . 
In a November 21 meeting with [PER U/S Larson  ] ( septel ) , [ORG Cardoso  ] administration minister [PER Parente  ] expressed great admiration for [PER Palocci  ] and hoped that we would become Minister of Finance .
