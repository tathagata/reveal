[LOC PANAMA  ] 508 <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
[LOC PANAMA  ] 519 Classified By: AMBASSADOR BARBARA J. STEPHENSON FOR REASONS 1.4 ( b ) & ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) In an elaborate ceremony attended by President [PER Martinelli  ] and most of the Cabinet , the [ORG Panama Canal Authority  ] ( [ORG ACP  ] ) announced that the consortium led by [MISC Spanish  ] firm [ORG Sacyr  ] had won the $3.2 billion contract to build the third set of locks , centerpiece of the once-in-a-century [ORG Canal Expansion  ] project . 
This award marks an increased tide of [MISC Spanish  ] influence in [LOC Panama  ] . 
President [PER Torrijos  ] had established very close ties with the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG Royals  ] , attending a ceremony in [LOC Madrid  ] in his honor during devastating floods last November , during which [LOC Spain  ] announced a gift of two helos to [LOC Panama  ] . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] government also established a regional crisis response center in [LOC Panama  ] . 
In early June , President [PER Martinelli  ] visited the King of [LOC Spain  ] , and the [MISC Spanish  ] delegation at President [PER Martinelli  ] 's inauguration , led by [PER Prince Felipe  ] , was very well received ( ref A ) . 
We strongly suspect that the financially troubled [ORG Sacyr  ] was able to offer a surprisingly low price due to backing from the [MISC Spanish  ] government. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG Sacyr  ] 's win over consortia led by [ORG Bechtel  ] and [ORG ACS  ] ( also from [LOC Spain  ] ) complicates our bilateral relationship on both political and economic levels . 
On the political level , the award casts an unwelcome spotlight on the [PER Aleman  ] family . 
[PER Alberto Aleman Zubieta  ] , the [ORG ACP  ] Administrator , formerly served as General Manager of [ORG CUSA  ] , [LOC Panama  ] 's largest construction company and a junior member of the [ORG Sacyr  ] consortium . 
In the mid-1990 's [PER Alberto Aleman  ] 's cousin , [PER Rogelio Aleman  ] , succeeded him as the [ORG GM  ] of [LOC CUSA  ] ( with [PER Alberto  ] reportedly selling his shares in the firm ) . 
Cousin [PER Jaime Aleman  ] , who provides legal representation to the winning consortium , is [PER Martinelli  ] 's Ambassador-designate to the [LOC United States  ] . 
In addition , [PER Alberto  ] 's sister , [PER Vicky  ] , is the wife of a founding partner of [PER Jaime  ] 's law firm. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) As expected , [ORG Sacyr  ] offered the lowest price , $3.2 billion , versus $4.3 billion for [ORG Bechtel  ] and nearly $6.0 billion for [ORG ACS  ] . 
A [ORG Bechtel  ] representative noted that the concrete cannot even be poured at [ORG Sacyr  ] 's price , and that ACS' price indicated that they did not want to win . 
More shocking was [ORG Sacyr  ] 's commanding win in technical points - 4089 , versus 3790 for [ORG Bechtel  ] and 3974 for [ORG ACS  ] . 
An earlier press leak by a member of the [ORG Sacyr  ] consortium that it had achieved the highest technical score ( ref B ) - despite expectations to the contrary - could cause [ORG Bechtel  ] to question the confidentiality of the process . 
A representative of [ORG Bechtel  ] 's partner , [ORG Mitsubishi  ] , told Ambassador that they would fight the award . 
Embassy will consult with [ORG Bechtel  ] and further report on the award of this contract and next steps .
