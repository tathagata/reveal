( C ) [PER Saleh Abdulsalam Saleh  ] , Chairman of the [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] 's ( [ORG QDF  ] ) [ORG Human Rights Committee  ] , confirmed to us that longtime political prisoner Dr. [PER Muhammad Bousidra  ] was released on June 14 and had returned to his family home in [LOC Benghazi  ] . 
Opposition website [LOC Libya  ] al-Youm reported on June 8 that [PER Bousidra  ] had been released ; however , [PER Saleh  ] said the organization had misinterpreted his conversation with them and that [PER Bousidra  ] had not yet been released at that time . 
The premature announcement by [LOC Libya  ] al-Youm had then prompted [MISC Libyan  ] security officials - who had been unaware that he was to be set free - to balk , delaying his release until the [ORG QDF  ] could secure the necessary permissions . 
2 . 
( C ) According to opposition websites , [PER Bousidra  ] was a religious cleric and political activist who was arrested in January 1989 and held for over ten years without being charged . 
He is described as having been the longest-serving , living political prisoner in [MISC Libyan  ] custody . 
[PER Bousidra  ] was hastily tried in late 1999/early 2000 by a specially-convened " People 's Court " on charges that he had sought to undermine the al-Fatah revolution and was sentenced to life imprisonment . 
He was re-tried in 2005 and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment on the original charges , which dated to actions in 1988 . 
He had already served 17 years in prison at the time of the re-trial and it was argued he should be released ; however , [PER Saleh  ] said the [ORG Internal Security Organization  ] ( [ORG ISO  ] ) had refused to let him go . 
3 . 
( C ) [PER Saleh  ] said the [ORG QDF  ] , which is chaired by [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi , recently brokered [PER Bousidra  ] 's release as part of a broader program of dialogue with former religious extremists , which has led to the release of some former members of the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Islamic Fighting Group  ] ( reftel and previous ) . 
He said [PER Bousidra  ] had been provided with financial compensation , allowed to return to his home and would be assisted in trying to find a job and " regain his life " . 
[PER Saleh  ] was evasive on the question of whether [PER Bousidra  ] remained under house arrest . 
In a formulation we 've heard before in connection with the case of [PER Fathi  ] el-Jahmi , he conceded that [MISC Libyan  ] security officers were posted at [PER Bousidra  ] 's house , ostensibly to protect him from irate citizens and conservative regime elements who might otherwise seek to do him harm in retaliation for his alleged activities to topple al-Qadhafi 's regime .
