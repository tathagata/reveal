( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: [LOC Israel  ] suffered three attacks within the span of one hour in an effort to break the calm ( “tahdiya” ) and derail the impending disengagement , according to [LOC Brigadier General  ] [PER Eitan Dangot  ] , Military Secretary to Defense Minister [PER Mofaz  ] , who met with the Ambassador and Acting DATT on July 13 .

End summary. ------------- [ORG PIJ  ] CAMPAIGN ? ------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Dangot  ] provided a brief summary of the July 12 attacks . 
[PER Dangot  ] stated that all three attacks took place within the span of one hour , and were likely linked . 
[ORG PIJ  ] , he stated , is attempting to provoke a strong [MISC Israeli  ] response in efforts to destroy the “tahdiya” or calm . 
On July 12: -- A gunman fired several rounds at the [ORG IDF  ] position at [LOC Rosh Hanikra  ] . 
The [ORG IDF  ] did not respond , he stated , and no one was injured in the attack . 
The [ORG IDF  ] noted that [ORG Hizballah  ] had vacated posts along the southern border with [LOC Israel  ] prior to the attack , suggesting the link to [ORG Hizballah  ] . 
-- A [MISC Palestinian  ] drove a small pickup truck loaded with gas canisters into the [ORG Shavei Shomron  ] settlement . 
The driver had waited for someone to exit the settlement and drove through the open gate . 
He detonated the explosive device near the settlement’s kindergarten , which was no longer in session . 
The [MISC Palestinian  ] was severely burned ; there were no other casualties . 
The [ORG IDF  ] , [PER Dangot  ] stated , believes that wanted [ORG PIJ  ] leader [PER Louis Saadi  ] or his deputy was involved in planning the attack . 
-- A suicide bomber detonated an explosive charge near a mall in [LOC Netanya  ] , killing four [MISC Israelis  ] , severely wounding at least six others , and causing a total of 91 to seek medical treatment . 
[ORG PIJ  ] claimed responsibility for the attack . 
The [ORG IDF  ] believes that [LOC Tulkarm  ] area [ORG PIJ  ] commander [PER Louay Saadi  ] was behind the attack . 
[PER Saadi  ] , who masterminded the Stage Club attack in [LOC Tel Aviv  ] on 25 February , is in hiding . 
[MISC Saadi’s  ] cell operates in the [LOC Tulkarm  ] area , including the villages of [LOC Atil  ] , [LOC Ilar  ] and [LOC Saida.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Dangot  ] stated that PIJ-sponsored attacks are increasing . 
In [LOC Gaza  ] , the [ORG IDF  ] has tracked [ORG PIJ  ] connected incidents for the past weeks and has noted a marked increase in mortar , [ORG Qassam  ] rocket , explosive charge and shooting attack against [MISC Israelis  ] . 
These attacks , he explained , are not the work of breakaway [ORG PIJ  ] cells , but part of a campaign orchestrated by the [ORG PIJ  ] headquarters in [LOC Damascus  ] . 
[LOC Damascus  ] is pushing the field to conduct attacks against [LOC Israel  ] , said [ORG Dangot.  ] ----------- [ORG PA  ] Inaction ----------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG IDF  ] received a number of indications that [PER Saadi  ] was planning terror attacks , and passed [MISC Saadi’s  ] name to the [ORG PA  ] several months ago . 
The [ORG GOI  ] requested that [ORG PA  ] Minister of [ORG Interior  ] [PER Nasir Yusif  ] arrest him . 
To date , said [PER Dangot  ] , the [ORG PA  ] has taken little action against the organization . 
In [LOC Tulkarm  ] , eleven [ORG PIJ  ] fugitives declined to sign a declaration ending terror attacks and refused to surrender their weapons to the [ORG PA  ] . 
In response , the [ORG PA  ] centralized them in [LOC Tulkarm  ] and provided them shelter at night . 
Moreover , [PER Dangot  ] noted that [PER Mahmud Abbas  ] failed to clearly blame [ORG PIJ  ] , during his condemnation of yesterday’s terror attack. ---------------- Time Running Out ---------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) As disengagement approaches , [PER Dangot  ] explained , the potential negative impact of successful attacks increases , particularly in its effect on domestic public opinion and support . 
Moreover , such attacks decrease [MISC Israel’s  ] maneuver space , and make risk-taking in security areas more difficult , as in the case of [LOC Bethlehem  ] , with its close proximity to [LOC Jerusalem  ] . 
Finally , the [ORG IDF  ] does not want to begin disengagement under the back-drop of increasing violence. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) During discussions on transferring security responsibility , the [ORG IDF  ] warned the [ORG PA  ] that it would reenter areas transferred to [ORG PA  ] security responsibility if the [MISC Palestinians  ] failed to control attacks on [MISC Israelis  ] emanating from them . 
As a result , the [ORG GOI  ] decided last night to take action against the [ORG PIJ  ] , acting where the [ORG PA  ] does not . 
Early on July 13 , the [ORG IDF  ] temporarily reentered [LOC Tulkarm  ] , and began a series of arrests . 
During the initial stages of the operation , [ORG PA  ] security forces fired on , and lightly wounded , two soldiers . 
When returning fire , the [ORG IDF  ] killed two [ORG PA  ] security forces members. ------------------------ Security Cabinet Meeting ------------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Dangot  ] provided a summary of the previous day’s Security Cabinet meeting , stating the group would hold two or three more meetings on disengagement issues over the next month . 
During the July 12 discussions , the Prime Minister explained his vision that disengagement would mean the end of the military occupation in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
Once completed , there would be no symbols of military occupation , including [ORG IDF  ] presence on the [ORG Philadelphi Strip.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The Security Cabinet discussed potential security arrangements concerning the ports ) sea , air , and land ) but no decisions were made . 
It was clear , [PER Dangot  ] stated , that the [ORG IDF  ] would , over time , leave the [LOC Philadelphi Strip  ] , following assessment of the effectiveness of the [MISC Egyptian  ] border deployment , and the effectiveness of the [ORG PA  ] security forces in combating smuggling and cross-border attacks . 
[PER Dangot  ] stated that [LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC Israel  ] are still discussing the “responsibility” clause , which is holding up agreement on the deployment of border guards. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The Security Cabinet looked also at several options concerning the [LOC Rafah  ] crossing ) leave it as is , shift cargo operations to [LOC Nitsana  ] , or move to [PER Kerem Shalom  ] . 
No decisions were made . 
[PER Dangot  ] stated that the [ORG GOI  ] would look at third party supervision of customs and security arrangements , using a staged or incremental approach that would help build mutual confidence and trust. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The Prime Minister intends to cancel the military government in [LOC Gaza  ] , [LOC Dangott  ] said , but needs a task force from [ORG Justice  ] , [ORG Defense  ] and others to explore new legal rulings on how to proceed with the [MISC Palestinians  ] . 
Concerning the passage issue , the Security Cabinet agreed to an interim solution of using truck convoys between [LOC Gaza  ] and the [LOC West Bank  ] for door-to-door delivery of cargo in some areas . 
A similar system , using busses to transport people could also be adopted . 
[PER Dangot  ] added that details were not examined ; a team is needed to study possible long-term solutions such as a train , sunken road , tunnel , etc. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) MoD Director-General [PER Amos Yaron  ] briefed the Security Cabinet on the 3-4 terminals in [LOC Gaza  ] and some 38 crossing points for the [LOC West Bank  ] , receiving Cabinet permission to solicit funding , estimated at some 500 million USD initially , from the international community . 
The cabinet also decided that the [LOC Gaza  ] borders would be based on the 1994 map , and would include the territorial exchanges made in 1949-50. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Concerning the [LOC West Bank  ] , the Security Cabinet decided that there would be no change of status for the four areas containing the evacuated settlements for the time being . 
These areas would remain classified as “C” zones . 
However , the [ORG GOI  ] would continue to coordinate issues with the [ORG PA  ] concerning road construction or other issues . 
The Ambassador suggested that [LOC Israel  ] carefully examine its position on [LOC Rafah  ] and the [LOC Philadelphi Strip  ] , to ensure that it had an executable exit strategy. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Comment: [ORG Israel Defense Intelligence  ] assesses that the [LOC Damascus  ] [ORG PIJ  ] headquarters is behind the Tuesday attacks , but continues to sift through information in search of a “smoking gun.” [PER Dangot  ] was careful to explain that renewed [ORG IDF  ] operations would continue in the [LOC West Bank  ] , but indicated that operations in the [LOC Gaza  ] strip would be restrained in efforts not to fuel a new spiral of violence . 
Nonetheless , expanded operations against [ORG PIJ  ] risk accidental killings of bystanders , which would surely fuel a new round of violence . 
Note: Meeting took place before [ORG Hamas  ] attack that killed one in [MISC Nativ Ha’asara.KURTZER</pre></code>  ]
