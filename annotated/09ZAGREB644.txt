<code><pre>Friday , 30 October 2009 , 15:38 C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 [ORG ZAGREB  ] 000644 SIPDIS STATE PASS EUR/SCE EO 12958 DECL: 10/27/2019 TAGS PGOV , PREL , KCOR , HR SUBJECT: PM [PER KOSOR  ] STRENGTHENING POLITICAL WILL TO FIGHT CORRUPTION ; DEPUTY PM POLANCEC RESIGNS REF: [ORG ZAGREB  ] 633 [ORG Classified By: Political  ] Officer [PER Chris Zimmer  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: Since [PER Jadranka Kosor  ] took over as Prime Minister in July following [MISC Ivo Sanader’s  ] sudden resignation , she has brought to her office what appears to be a new attitude toward allegedly corrupt party members that is strengthening the political will to fight corruption at all levels in the [MISC Croatian  ] government and economy . 
While no convictions have occurred since she took office , a steady stream of investigations and indictments has been coming out of the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] and the [ORG State Prosecutor’s Offices  ] . 
Senior government officials have told us that [PER Kosor  ] has said she will not protect corrupt members of the party out of loyalty or to maintain influence , as [PER Sanader  ] did . 
On October 30 , Deputy PM and Economics Minister [PER Damir Polancec  ] resigned over allegations of involvement in a scandal at a large agri-business firm . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) For the past three years , the [MISC Croatian  ] [ORG State Prosecutor’s Office  ] for the [ORG Suppression of Organized Crime and Corruption  ] ( [ORG USKOK  ] ) has been ratcheting up its activity in corruption cases . 
Until this year , however , its cases had involved mid-level bureaucrats in services such as the land registry , or health and education systems . 
Few indictees could be described as being politically-well connected . 
Since this summer , however , a series of cases have been playing out in both the media and the police and prosecutors’ offices . 
These cases have begun to reach politically-connected individuals . 
Cases under investigation have already led to significant changes in management , and detention of some key players , at the state-owned electric company [ORG HEP  ] , and the 25-percent state-owned food producer [ORG Podravka  ] . 
In another case , a long-awaited investigation of a military procurement from 2004 in involving former Defense ( and later [ORG Interior  ] ) Minister [PER Berislav Roncevic  ] was launched following [MISC Sanader’s  ] July resignation , with indictments issued against [PER Roncevic  ] and a close aide on October 28 ( reftel ) . 
State Prosecutors have confided to us that they have a number of other cases either under indictment or active investigation that could also implicate high-level political figures . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) All of these cases have reportedly created strains within the ruling [ORG HDZ  ] party , with senior party members arguing that the government should not rush to judgment , and that [PER Kosor  ] was being too quick to seek dismissal of those tainted by various allegations . 
The [MISC Prodravka  ] case presents the latest challenge in this regard . 
Minister of Economy ( and Deputy Prime Minister ) [PER Damir Polancec  ] is a former [ORG Podravka  ] executive and is suspected of participation in the alleged scheme by which the management board was using embezzled funds to buy a controlling interest in the company . 
Six managers were arrested last week for their roles in the scheme , but [PER Polancec  ] has not been publicly named by investigators as a suspect . 
Opposition parties and the media called vociferously for [MISC Polancec’s  ] resignation , and the leader of a junior partner in the ruling coalition publicly stated that his party , the [ORG Independent Serb Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG SDSS  ] ) , would not support [PER Polancec  ] if parliament voted on a motion for his dismissal . 
[PER Polancec  ] suddenly resigned his position today ( October 30 ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Many well-informed sources have commented in particular on the shift in attitudes toward corruption between [PER Kosor  ] and her predecessor , [PER Ivo Sanader  ] . 
MFA State Secretary [PER Davor Bozinovic  ] told the Ambassador on October 26 that [PER Kosor  ] potentially is commencing an historic shift in governance in [LOC Croatia  ] . 
He and others have noted that President Mesic is quietly supporting [PER Kosor  ] , his erstwhile presidential opponent , against the [ORG HDZ  ] old guard . 
[PER Bozinovic  ] regretted that the opposition is not supporting her anti-corruption efforts , which could spare them a difficult task when they return to power. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG Chamber of Commerce  ] President [PER Nadan Vidosevic  ] , a long-time [ORG HDZ  ] member and now independent candidate for president of [LOC Croatia  ] , told the Ambassador on October 27 that he also saw a change in approach . 
He claimed [PER Sanader  ] and [PER Kosor  ] had recently argued over Kosor’s approach to the corruption investigations . 
[PER Kosor  ] insisted that Chief State Prosecutor [PER Bajic  ] be allowed to pursue all leads , while [PER Sanader  ] saw this as a threat to him and other party cronies . 
[ORG ZAGREB  ] 00000644 002 OF 002 ( NOTE: [PER Bajic  ] himself has told the Ambassador that he has the authority to investigate anybody as evidence dictates , and that he would pursue an investigation against [PER Polancec  ] in the [ORG Podravka  ] case . 
END NOTE . 
) A media source recently alleged to us that [PER Kosor  ] had directly threatened [PER Sanader  ] with potential legal action . 
Vidosovic claimed [PER Polancec  ] told him he would finger [PER Sanader  ] if he were indicted. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Luka Madjeric  ] , Head of the [ORG Government’s Office for Human Rights  ] and a former assistant to [PER Kosor  ] , told [PER Poloff  ] that [PER Kosor  ] rose quietly through the ranks of the [ORG HDZ  ] . 
Therefore , he said , she does not have as many political IOUs , nor is she complicit in the scandals now plaguing other party members . 
This allows her to address corruption issues in a more straightforward manner than her predecessor . 
Since she does not have to worry about being personally implicated in the scandals , she is more willing than [PER Sanader  ] was to allow prosecutors and police to pursue leads that may implicate top party officials. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The new political will to target corruption coincides with improved procedures for investigating and prosecuting cases , many of which have been designed and advocated for under [LOC US  ] and other donors’ assistance programs . 
In September , the national police officially opened their own Office for the [ORG Suppression of Corruption  ] and [ORG Organized Crime  ] ( [MISC PN-USKOK  ] ) , which serves as a partner to the prosecutor’s [ORG USKOK  ] division . 
Both the police and prosecutor USKOKs have offices in the four largest cities , [LOC Zagreb  ] , [LOC Split  ] , [LOC Rijeka  ] , and [LOC Osijek  ] , and jurisdiction for investigating organized crime and corruption cases . 
Courts in these four cities also have specialized [ORG USKOK  ] courts , created in early 2009 , with cleared panels of experienced judges specially trained to hear these complex criminal cases . 
And , as of July 1 , [PER Croatia’s  ] new Law on Criminal Procedure granted [ORG USKOK  ] prosecutors many of the functions previously held by investigative judges . 
Prosecutors can now question suspects and witnesses without going through lengthy procedures in the courts . 
[PER Bajic  ] has told us that these changes have greatly increased the pace of investigations and helped minimize leaks and the potential for witness tampering. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) COMMENT: Kosor’s willingness to confront corruption appears genuine . 
But it almost certainly includes some elements of political calculation . 
First , the strategy of simply denying , ignoring or stiff-arming corruption investigations was growing increasingly hard to sustain , especially given [MISC USKOK’s  ] increasing effectiveness . 
Trying to de-fang [ORG USKOK  ] , as some [ORG HDZ  ] hard-liners have reportedly suggested , would have met with strong international condemnation and damaged [PER Croatia’s  ] [ORG EU  ] aspirations . 
Second , [PER Kosor  ] , who rose to the top of the party without a mandate from the voters and with less long-standing ties than many of the party’s barons , may well be quite happy to see intra-party rivals weakened by more aggressive and free-ranging investigations into corruption . 
Finally , given the [MISC HDZ’s  ] current unpopularity , [PER Kosor  ] may simply have calculated that she had little to lose , and that it was best to start right away in hopes of changing the [MISC HDZ’s  ] public image before the next elections , which must be held by fall 2011 but could come as early as spring 2010 if the governing coalition fractured . 
So , while the developments of the past few months signal progress , it is premature to declare victory in the fight against corruption in [LOC Croatia  ] . 
No “big fish” convictions have yet been secured . 
And [PER Kosor  ] may yet find that the strains created by anti-corruption cases may complicate dealing with challenges such as the economic crisis and completing the requirements for [ORG EU  ] accession . 
Nonetheless , this is potentially the beginning of a watershed moment in [LOC Croatia  ] , made possible by an unexpected leader whose party cannot at the moment afford to disperse with her . 
END COMMENT .
