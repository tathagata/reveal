( U ) This cable contains [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy [ORG Cairo  ] 's response to [MISC Trafficking  ] in [MISC Persons  ] ( TIP ) contribution requirements ( reftel A ) . 
The following text contains responses to paragraphs 23-29 in the original tasking cable. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) THE COUNTRY'S TIP SITUATION: -- [PER A. Available  ] sources of information include the press , the [MISC Egyptian  ] government , [ORG UN  ] organizations , and independent TIP experts . 
We regularly discuss TIP with officials in the [MISC Egyptian  ] [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] ( [ORG MFA  ] ) , [ORG Ministry of State for Family and Population  ] ( [ORG MSFP  ] ) , the Public Prosecutor 's Office , the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] , the [ORG International Organization for Migration and UNICEF  ] . 
In 2010 , the [ORG National Council for Childhood and Motherhood  ] ( [ORG NCCM  ] ) - a unit of the [ORG MSFP  ] - conducted a study of " summer marriages , " a practice whereby [MISC Egyptian  ] girls and young women enter into short-term marriages with tourists , many from other [MISC Arab  ] countries . 
In conjunction with the release of the study , the [ORG NCCM  ] launched a media campaign to raise societal and government awareness of the practice , including establishing a " hotline " for reporting instances of the practice and to counsel victims . 
In 2010 , the [ORG National Commission for Combating Trafficking in Persons  ] , composed of 16 agencies in the Government , entered into an agreement with various [ORG UN  ] agencies to provide financial support to the [ORG National Center for Criminological and Social Research  ] 's efforts to carry out a comprehensive study on TIP to determine the nature and scope of the problem in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
The anticipated completion date for the study is the fall of 2010 . 
Our sources are generally reliable , but several are likely to reflect the government 's view of the situation . 
-- [PER B. Egypt  ] is a country of origin for street children and others trafficked domestically and there are reports that [LOC Egypt  ] is used as a transit country for [ORG Eastern European  ] women being trafficked to [LOC Israel  ] . 
Trafficking occurs within the country 's borders , but does not occur in territories outside the government 's control . 
Street children are the most vulnerable population . 
Street children are trafficked locally where they may be forced to beg and participate in prostitution . 
Some independent analysts estimated that there may be as many as one million street children in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
Government experts believe the number to be lower and cite a study conducted by the government in 2009 , with financial and technical assistance from the [ORG World Bank  ] and the [ORG Arab Urban Development Institute  ] , which identified approximately 5200 street children in central [LOC Cairo  ] . 
There are many cases of child marriages where poor families , often living in villages , marry their daughters -some below 18 , the legal age of marriage - to older men from the [LOC Arabian Gulf  ] in return for money , which is used to assist the families financially . 
There are no statistics on the scope of this practice . 
Children are subject to domestic servitude , but there are no reliable statistics . 
Children are also recruited for seasonal agricultural work . 
Some children employed in domestic and agricultural work may face conditions of involuntary servitude , restrictions on movement , non-payment of wages , threats , and physical or sexual abuse . 
Instances of child sex tourism are reported in [LOC Cairo  ] , [LOC Alexandria  ] and [LOC Luxor  ] . 
There have been no changes in destinations for trafficking . 
[LOC CAIRO  ] 00000211 002 OF 010 The Government of [LOC Egypt  ] does not fully comply with minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking , but is undertaking significant actions to do so . 
In July 2007 , the government established the [ORG National Coordinating Committee  ] to [ORG Combat  ] and Prevent Trafficking in [MISC Persons  ] which improved inter-governmental coordination on anti-trafficking initiatives . 
In 2009 , the [ORG Committee  ] completed drafting a comprehensive law to criminalize all forms of trafficking in persons . 
The draft is currently under consideration by [LOC Egypt  ] 's Parliament , and [LOC Egypt  ] 's ruling [ORG National Democratic Party  ] announced in November 2009 that passage of the law is one of the party 's priorities for the 2009-2010 legislative session . 
The [MISC Egyptian  ] Government in June 2008 passed amendments to its [ORG Child Law  ] , which criminalized trafficking of children . 
In 2009 , two marriage registrars were prosecuted under the law for facilitating marriages of hundreds of under-age [MISC Egyptian  ] girls , primarily to foreigners . 
An additional 22 registrars were arrested and are reportedly under investigation by [LOC Egypt  ] 's Public Prosecutor for facilitating hundreds of other marriages , in violation of the [ORG Child Law  ] . 
In early 2010 , five people were arrested for facilitating an under-age marriage including the victim 's parents , the " husband , " a marriage " broker " and the registrar . 
Since the passage of the [ORG Child Law  ] amendments , the Public Prosecutor 's office conducted training for 125 prosecutors working on children 's cases . 
The three-day training program , organized with the assistance of [LOC USAID  ] , defined trafficking in children , addressed prosecutor responsibilities for protecting child victims , educated prosecutors about street children , and addressed the need to provide health and psychological care for child victims . 
The Public Prosecutor 's office prepared a handbook that was distributed to all prosecutors working with children , which explains how to use the child law amendments to prosecute cases . 
In 2008 , the [ORG National Committee for Childhood and Motherhood  ] ( [ORG NCCM  ] ) formed a special anti-trafficking unit using [ORG USD  ] 1 million in [ORG USAID  ] funds made available through the [ORG Ministry of International Cooperation  ] . 
The establishment of this unit strengthened measures to prevent and combat trafficking in children through: 1 ) legislative reform , 2 ) capacity building of governmental and civil society organizations to address issues related to child trafficking ; 3 ) raising public awareness and community responsibility ; 4 ) establishing a mechanism for data collection and analysis ; and 5 ) protecting and rehabilitating children at risk and their families . 
[ORG NCCM  ] 's TIP Unit will also develop a national plan of action to combat child trafficking . 
The unit 's goal is to provide protection and assistance to victims and children at risk , rehabilitate victims of trafficking , provide training and awareness , establish a database and coordinate activities of governmental and non governmental bodies . 
The [ORG National Council for Women  ] also established a special unit for TIP to push for policies to protect women from becoming trafficking victims . 
-- C . 
The conditions that people are trafficked into depend on the type of trafficking . 
Street children remain on the streets , but are subject to abuse . 
There are reports that women from [ORG Eastern Europe  ] are moved from [LOC Cairo  ] to the [LOC Sinai Peninsula  ] and then to [LOC Israel  ] . 
Such reports are difficult to verify . 
-- [PER D. Street  ] children , young females from economically underprivileged families , female refugees , and [ORG Eastern European  ] females going to [LOC Israel  ] through [LOC Egypt  ] are most at risk of being trafficked . 
-- [PER E. Traffickers  ] are street children , family members , marriage [LOC CAIRO  ] 00000211 003 OF 010 brokers , and external organized crime groups ( i.e. purportedly moving women from [ORG Eastern Europe  ] through [LOC Egypt  ] to [LOC Israel  ] ) . 
Victims in [LOC Egypt  ] are usually trafficked because they are vulnerable and lack the ability to protect themselves , such as street children , young girls from impoverished families , and refugees . 
Traffickers may use money as a motivation for trafficking . 
In the case of early marriages , young females ( some , but not all , below the legal marriage age ) may accept marriage to older men , often from the [LOC Gulf  ] , in return for financial assistance to themselves and their families . 
In the case of street children , traffickers may approach potential victims to make them part of the group or the gang . 
There are no national or official agencies that traffic victims. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) SETTING THE SCENE FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S ANTI-TIP EFFORTS: -- A . 
The government now recognizes the trafficking of street children and " summer " marriages as domestic slavery issues . 
Government officials previously noted that [LOC Egypt  ] has been used as a transit country for [ORG Eastern European  ] women trafficked to [LOC Israel  ] . 
The government will host the first visit to [LOC Egypt  ] by the [ORG UN Special  ] Rapportuer on Trafficking in Person 's in April 2010 . 
-- [PER B. Multiple  ] government agencies are involved in anti-trafficking efforts especially under the auspices of the [ORG National Coordinating Committee  ] to [ORG Combat  ] and Prevent Trafficking in [MISC Persons  ] . 
The lead agency for the [ORG Committee  ] is the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] . 
However , 15 agencies are also involved including the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] , Public Prosecutor 's Office , the [ORG National Council for Childhood and Motherhood  ] , [ORG National Council for Criminological and Social Studies  ] , [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] , [ORG Ministry of Social Solidarity  ] , [ORG Ministry of Tourism , Ministry of Health , Ministry of Information , Ministry of Manpower and Migration  ] , [ORG Ministry  ] of Education and the [ORG National Council for Women  ] . 
-- C . 
The lack of financial resources is a significant impediment to the implementation of trafficking laws . 
Additionally , the lack of training for first responders ( police ) has impeded implementation , although in 2008 and 2009 [ORG IOM  ] and [LOC Egypt  ] 's [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] collaborated to provide TIP training to police officials . 
Prosecutors and judges could also use training to help prosecute cases under trafficking laws , although in 2009 the Public Prosecutor 's office successfully prosecuted two cases involving marriage registrars and a case involving prostitution and street children . 
[LOC Egypt  ] lacks data and statistics on the nature and scope of trafficking , although in 2009 , as discussed above , the government , in cooperation with [ORG UN  ] agencies , initiated a national study to evaluate the scope of the issue . 
Overall corruption is a problem , but it is not directly related to trafficking in persons . 
The government lacks resources to aid victims , but in 2009 , in cooperation with the [ORG IOM  ] , the [ORG Ministry of Health  ] allocated public hospital facilities and personnel to establish a trafficking victim 's resource center . 
[LOC Egypt  ] 's [ORG Ministry of State for Family and Population  ] ( [ORG MSFP  ] ) , working with [ORG NGOs  ] , established in August 2009 in [LOC Cairo  ] 's low-income [ORG Dar Al Salaam  ] area a rehabilitation center for victims of child trafficking . 
-- D . 
The government does not systematically monitor anti-trafficking efforts in terms of prosecution , prevention and protection. --E . 
The government has a well-developed birth registration and national identity card system . 
The 2008 [ORG Child Law  ] amendments [LOC CAIRO  ] 00000211 004 OF 010 addressed an inadequacy in the system by facilitating the registration of births out of wedlock . 
The [ORG NCCM  ] has a national program to encourage poor , rural families to register births. --F . 
The government is unable to systematically maintain and gather data on TIP and related prosecutions , in part because of the lack of comprehensive legislation . 
Local TIP experts rely on anecdotal and press accounts of prosecutions. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF TRAFFICKERS: -- A . 
The Child law: Enacted in 1996 .

[LOC CAIRO  ] 00000211 007 OF 010 -- C . 
The [ORG Unified Labor Law  ] does not define " forced labor . 
" Therefore , there are no specific provisions against it . 
The [MISC Egyptian  ] Government investigates labor recruiters and agents . 
If there is any wrongdoing , the case may be referred for prosecution under various penal code provisions , including " swindling . 
" There are occasional reports of confiscation of passports of foreign workers , although such reports are limited because , according to independent TIP experts , [LOC Egypt  ] 's large labor force and low wages makes [LOC Egypt  ] a relatively unattractive destination for labor migrants and there is no formal labor sponsorship ( [LOC Kafala  ] ) system in the country . 
-- [PER D. Those  ] who exploit , use or incite victims under 21-years old to practice prostitution shall be sentenced to not less than one year and not more than five years imprisonment . 
Anyone who uses any means of coercion , threat , or abuses this authority over the victim in order to exploit him/her sexually shall be subject to not less than one year and not more than seven years in prison .

The court sentenced one trafficker to life and the other to fifteen years in prison . 
In October 2009 , [MISC Egyptian  ] courts , also using the 2008 Child Law amendments , convicted and sentenced to prison two marriage registrars for illegally facilitating the marriages of more than 100 under-age girls to foreign men ( ref B ) . 
In November , local press reported that as part of an on-going investigation into under-age marriages , an additional 21 marriage registrars - suspected of illegally recording over 800 such marriages in 2009 - had been arrested . 
In February , the Public Prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings against five suspects for facilitating the marriage of an under-age girl to an older man from [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] .

( U ) PROTECTION AND ASSISTANCE TO VICTIMS: -- A . 
The Government is constrained by lack of resources . 
There is a medical file started for each child victim . 
The [ORG Ministry of Social Solidarity  ] and [ORG NGO  ] 's provide basic health care for victims . 
[ORG El Orman Orphanage  ] , a private facility operated by an [ORG NGO  ] , houses children in need of protection . 
-- [PER B. There  ] are care facilities , although resources may not be sufficient to meet the needs of all victims . 
In 2009 , the [ORG Ministry of Health  ] ( [ORG MoH  ] ) entered into an agreement with the [ORG IOM  ] to establish a trafficking victim 's care center in a [LOC Cairo  ] public hospital , staffed with [ORG MoH  ] employees trained in identifying and assisting trafficking victims . 
The center , due to open in March 2010 , will serve as a pilot for other centers and will provide care to both domestic and foreign trafficking victims .

Juvenile detention centers are in bad condition , and juveniles may be subject to incarceration with adults . 
Street children generally refuse to stay in shelters . 
Child victims may also be referred to their guardians . 
[LOC Egypt  ] 's [ORG Ministry of State for Family and Population  ] ( [ORG MSFP  ] ) , working with local [ORG NGOs  ] , established in August 2009 in [LOC Cairo  ] 's low-income [ORG Dar Al Salaam  ] area a rehabilitation center for victims of child trafficking . 
The [ORG Ministry of Social Solidarity  ] offers day-time shelters . 
In 2008 , [ORG NCCM  ] launched a special center for rehabilitation of victims of trafficking in persons .

-- [PER D. Foreign  ] trafficking victims may be returned to their countries of origin through their embassies in [LOC Cairo  ] , but they are not treated as criminals . 
[LOC CAIRO  ] 00000211 009 OF 010 -- E .

However , according to the government judges may make such referrals . 
-- [PER G. There  ] are no estimates on the number of trafficking victims . 
Some independent experts estimate that there may be as many as one million street children in [LOC Egypt  ] who are potentially at risk for trafficking , but there are no statistics on the actual trafficking cases among street children or other forms of trafficking .

-- H . 
The government 's law enforcement , immigration , and social services personnel do not have a formal system of proactively identifying victims of trafficking .

-- [PER I. There  ] is an effort under way to educate police and first responders to the need to respect the rights of and protect victims of trafficking . 
The [ORG IOM  ] 's training of police and the Prosecutor General 's Handbook are two examples of this effort . 
However , in practice street children and prostitutes may be treated as criminals rather than victims especially by the security apparatus . 
-- J . 
The government encourages street children to assist in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking offenses . 
However , in other cases the government may not push victims to testify due to familial and societal ramifications . 
-- [PER K. NCCM  ] TIP Unit began training for government officials on TIP focusing on prosecutors and judges .
