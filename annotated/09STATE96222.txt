( U ) This is an action request to Embassy [LOC Paris  ] . 
Please deliver the points in paragraph 4 as soon as possible . 
These points may be left as a non-paper. ------- SUMMARY ------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) We have information the [MISC French  ] firm [ORG Sofradir  ] and its subsidiary [ORG Ulis  ] continue to sell cooled and uncooled infrared detectors to a [MISC Chinese  ] firm for incorporation into thermal imaging systems . 
We believe the [MISC Chinese  ] firm , [LOC Zhejiang Dali Technology Company Ltd  ] , is actively selling its thermal imaging systems to [MISC Iranian  ] defense entities . 
[MISC Iranian  ] military access to [MISC Chinese  ] thermal imaging systems that rely on high-grade [MISC French  ] infrared detectors could increase the threat to [LOC US  ] and allied forces operating in the [LOC Gulf  ] region . 
We want to request the Government of [LOC France  ] to act immediately to terminate this activity by [ORG Sofradir  ] and [ORG Ulis  ] so [LOC China  ] cannot use [MISC French  ] components to manufacture weapons systems and sell them to [LOC Iran  ] , a state sponsor of terrorism. ------------------------- ACTION REQUEST/OBJECTIVES ------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Post is requested to approach appropriate host government officials as soon as possible to pursue the following objectives and to deliver the talking points/non-paper in para 4 below: -- Inform [MISC French  ] officials we have information the [MISC French  ] firm [ORG Sofradir  ] and its subsidiary [ORG Ulis  ] continue to sell cooled and uncooled infrared detectors to [LOC China  ] 's [LOC Zhejiang Dali Technology Company Ltd  ] for incorporation into thermal imaging systems . 
-- Stress that [LOC Zhejiang Dali Technology  ] is actively selling its thermal imaging systems to [MISC Iranian  ] defense entities and that the use of high-grade [MISC French  ] infrared detectors in this technology could increase the threat to [LOC US  ] and allied forces operating in the [LOC Gulf  ] region . 
-- Ask the [MISC French  ] government to investigate , share with us the results of its investigation , and act to have [ORG Sofradir  ] and [ORG Ulis  ] immediately terminate this activity . 
-- Emphasize to [MISC French  ] officials that infrared detectors are critical components of high performance thermal imaging systems and are controlled under the [ORG Wassenaar Arrangement  ] , [ORG Section  ] 6.A.2.a.3. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( SECRET/REL [LOC FRANCE  ] ) BEGIN TALKING POINTS -- In the interest of transparency and enhanced cooperation on nonproliferation matters , we would like to share the following information: -- We have information that the [MISC French  ] firm [ORG Sofradir  ] and its subsidiary [ORG Ulis  ] continue to sell both cooled and uncooled infrared detectors to [LOC China  ] 's [LOC Zhejiang Dali Technology Company Ltd  ] for incorporation into thermal imaging systems . 
-- Our information indicates the [MISC Chinese  ] firm is actively selling its thermal imaging systems to [MISC Iranian  ] defense entities . 
-- [MISC Iranian  ] military access to [MISC Chinese  ] thermal imaging systems that rely on high-grade [MISC French  ] infrared detectors could increase the threat to [LOC US  ] and allied forces operating in the [LOC Gulf  ] region . 
-- Infrared detectors ( IRD ) are sensors and critical components of high performance thermal imaging systems . 
IRDs are controlled under [ORG Wassenaar Arrangement  ] , [ORG Section  ] 6.A.2.a.3 . 
-- IRDs are used in the core assemblies for advanced targeting pods , long-range reconnaissance systems , gimbaled imaging systems in manned and unmanned airborne reconnaissance and combat aircraft , [ORG Forward Looking Infrared  ] ( [ORG FLIR  ] ) sensors , tank targeting systems , submarine periscopes , and missile seekers . 
-- Diversion of the subject components could be harmful to our shared national security interests . 
If these IRDs were included in the optical targeting mechanism for tanks and air defense systems , they could potentially be used to degrade [LOC US  ] superiority in night combat operations . 
-- We ask that you carefully consider the consequences of such sales . 
-- We also welcome any further information about this case that may come to light in the course of any [MISC French  ] investigation into the matter .
