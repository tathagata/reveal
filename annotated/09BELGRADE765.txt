( C ) Vice President Biden’s May 20 visit to [LOC Belgrade  ] , during which he met with President [PER Tadic  ] , Prime Minister [PER Cvetkovic  ] , and Defense Minister [PER Sutanovac  ] , marked a “new beginning” in the bilateral relationship thanks to the core message that the [LOC United States  ] recognized [LOC Serbia  ] as an important regional partner and potential contributor to global prosperity and stability . 
Two months later , we have seen constructive engagement from the [MISC Serbian  ] government on a certain number of issues . 
Our challenge now is to maintain and build on the momentum generated by the Vice President’s visit to keep pushing [LOC Serbia  ] forward on [MISC Euro-Atlantic  ] integration , regional relations , economic development , and the bilateral relationship . 
During this several-month period between Ambassadors , post urges [LOC Washington  ] policymakers to visit [LOC Belgrade  ] and engage in international fora with their [MISC Serbian  ] counterparts as frequently as possible on these key issues . 
End Summary . 
[MISC Euro-Atlantic  ] Integration ------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The Vice President’s message that the [LOC United States  ] wanted [LOC Serbia  ] to consider joining [ORG NATO  ] , but would not push it to do so given the lasting impact of the 1999 [ORG NATO  ] intervention , was well-received by the [MISC Serbian  ] government and public . 
[PER Lively  ] public debate about the pros and cons of joining [ORG NATO  ] was triggered by the recent 10th anniversary of the bombings , and was given additional impetus by the [ORG VPOTUS  ] visit . 
In addition , the Vice President’s decision to meet separately with Minister of Defense [PER Dragan Sutanovac  ] has given this reform-oriented advocate of cooperation with [ORG NATO  ] additional credibility and weight in the policymaking process . 
Moving forward , we should continue to expand our vibrant military-to-military relationship with [LOC Serbia  ] , work with partners to educate the public about the benefits of [ORG NATO  ] membership , and encourage the [MISC Serbian  ] government to cut through its interagency squabbles and open its long-awaited [ORG NATO  ] mission in [LOC Brussels  ] . 
We should also encourage [LOC Serbia  ] to play an increasingly active role in global security issues , for example by sending police to [LOC Afghanistan  ] within the [LOC ISAF  ] framework. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) It is also in our interest to find new ways to support Serbia’s aspirations to join the [ORG European Union  ] , in that integration is the surest guarantee of increased prosperity and stability in the [LOC Balkans  ] . 
Our existing assistance programs are already focused on the reforms needed for successful [ORG EU  ] candidacy , from the economic sector to good governance and rule of law , and should be continued . 
While progress is slow and imperfect , the [MISC Serbian  ] government is gradually working its way through the mountain of reform legislation that it must adopt and implement in these areas . 
Its main challenge now is to convince The [LOC Netherlands  ] that its efforts to capture [ORG ICTY  ] indictees [PER Ratko Mladic  ] and [PER Goran Hadzic  ] are sincere and effective , as the [MISC Dutch  ] insist on Serbia’s full cooperation with The [ORG Hague Tribunal  ] as a prerequisite to unfreezing the [ORG Interim Trade Agreement  ] and ratifying the [ORG Stabilization and Association Agreement  ] . 
Pursuant to Vice President Biden’s discussion of the issue with President [PER Tadic  ] , we are working with the [ORG FBI  ] to bring a fugitive investigation expert to [LOC Belgrade  ] to review the case file on [PER Mladic  ] and determine whether there are avenues of investigation or techniques that have not yet been applied . 
Continued engagement with the [MISC Dutch  ] government to identify steps the [MISC Serbian  ] government could take to demonstrate its best efforts to cooperate with the [ORG ICTY  ] would enhance our leverage with the [MISC Serbian  ] government . 
[LOC BELGRADE  ] 00000765 002 OF 004 Regional Relations ------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The Vice President’s clear statement during his visit that the [LOC United States  ] is not asking [LOC Serbia  ] to recognize [LOC Kosovo  ] helped defuse tension over this issue . 
Some in government , most notably Foreign Minister [PER Vuk Jeremic  ] and officials from the [ORG Kosovo Ministry  ] , continue to take an obstinate and non-constructive public approach to relations with [LOC Kosovo  ] , however . 
Although we are still seeking a modus operandi in which [MISC Serbian  ] and [LOC Kosovo  ] officials can engage in regional fora on essential areas of cooperation , including trade , and organized crime , some progress is happening behind the scenes . 
In the two months since the Vice President’s visit , the [MISC Serbian  ] government has encouraged [LOC Kosovo  ] [MISC Serbs  ] to return to the [ORG Kosovo Police Service  ] ( KPS ) ; worked with KEK to encourage [LOC Kosovo  ] [MISC Serbs  ] to sign electricity contracts ; and fired Northern [LOC Kosovo  ] hardliner [PER Marko Jaksic  ] from his GOS-paid job as head of the [ORG Mitrovica Health Center.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) We are not seeing a sufficiently constructive approach from the [MISC Serbian  ] government on decentralization and the [MISC ICO-led  ] plan to create five new [MISC Serb-majority  ] municipalities in [LOC Kosovo  ] through municipal elections in November , however ; rather than recognizing it as the best opportunity for [LOC Kosovo  ] [MISC Serbs  ] to defend their interests , President [PER Tadic  ] and others have made unhelpful , preemptive statements saying that the [MISC Serbian  ] government cannot approve any elections carried out under the [ORG Ahtisaari Plan  ] by the “false state” of [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
Another stumbling block is Serbia’s intent to hold elections in August in [LOC Kosovo  ] for the [MISC Belgrade-controlled  ] parallel structures in two municipalities . 
It is premature to conclude that the [MISC Serbian  ] government’s position on the November elections is immutable , however . 
President Tadic’s statement that “the conditions do not exist for us to encourage [LOC Kosovo  ] [MISC Serbs  ] to participate in these elections” provides us an opening to initiate a dialogue with pragmatic elements in [LOC Belgrade  ] -- namely [PER Tadic  ] and his advisors -- about the conditions under which the [MISC Serbian  ] government could support [LOC Kosovo  ] [MISC Serb  ] participation . 
While it may not ultimately be possible to reach common ground , it is important to try . 
[ORG Economic Development  ] -------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) During his meeting with Prime Minister [PER Cvetkovic  ] , Vice President [PER Biden  ] praised the [MISC Serbian  ] government’s efforts to minimize the impact of the global economic crisis on the country . 
He encouraged [LOC Serbia  ] to deal with the issue of property restitution , as it was the only country in the region that had not done so , and the uncertainty surrounding land ownership was having a negative effect on the investment climate . 
Since the visit , a draft law on zoning and the use of construction land that has been in development for several years has moved forward from the Government to the Parliament . 
As currently written , the draft law will clarify the situation by granting title to land to those who currently have ownership or use rights of the buildings on it . 
The law will almost completely eliminate the possibility of restitution in kind to claimants , however , except in the case of vacant/undeveloped property . 
The draft law foresees the creation of a restitution fund that would be financed by the proceeds of the conversion of privatized public enterprise land to other uses . 
In order to ensure the equity of the process , which is of particular interest to the [MISC Serbian-American  ] diaspora , we are engaging with the government and parliament to carefully consider the two issues - restitution and zoning - so as not to have the zoning law preempt legitimate claims for restitution ( reftel A ) . 
[LOC BELGRADE  ] 00000765 003 OF 004 <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [LOC Serbia  ] continues to face a tough road toward economic development . 
While it continues to make progress toward [LOC WTO  ] , accession is not expected before mid-2010 due to the need for significant amounts of additional legislation . 
Meanwhile , the economic crisis continues to bite into [LOC Serbia  ] as foreign direct investment has nearly dried up and the government has become increasingly dependent on borrowing to meet budgetary demands this year . 
It will be important to encourage the government to continue making the necessary reforms to free the economy from the old state-centered model and to encourage greater market liberalization and entrepreneurship , so that it will be competitive once the global economy rebounds . 
Bilateral Relationship ---------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) President Obama’s election generated enormous goodwill in [LOC Serbia  ] , and people here believe that the new Administration is taking a more even-handed approach to the [LOC Balkans  ] than in the past . 
Vice President Biden’s visit confirmed and cemented this impression on the part of both the [MISC Serbian  ] government and public , by demonstrating that one of the most vocal critics of the [MISC Milosevic  ] regime now saw the leadership of [LOC Serbia  ] as potential partners and forces for regional stability . 
We still have a great deal of work to do to uproot entrenched stereotypes of the [LOC U.S.  ] Government as imperialistic , anti-Serb , and pro-Albanian , however . 
A recent Medium [MISC Gallup  ] poll showed [LOC Serbia  ] tied with [LOC Pakistan  ] for first place - at 61% -- on the list of countries whose citizens hold negative views of the [LOC United States  ] . 
Frequent statements from the [MISC Serbian  ] government characterizing the [LOC United States  ] as an international bully , combined with a pronounced aversion to acknowledging [LOC U.S.  ] partnership and assistance and a penchant for exaggerating [MISC Russian  ] contributions and the importance of the [ORG Non-Aligned Movement  ] , contribute to this outdated public perception . 
We will push our [MISC Serbian  ] interlocutors to take a more balanced and mature approach to their public statements about the [LOC United States  ] , while continuing our intense public diplomacy efforts to highlight our work here. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Visas are a central issue in Serbia’s relations with its [MISC Western  ] partners , and the [LOC United States  ] is no exception . 
[MISC Serbian  ] citizens long for the days when they could travel freely with [MISC Yugoslav  ] passports and chafe under visa requirements , seeing them as a “sanction” held over from the 1990s . 
While the application process for [LOC U.S.  ] visas is light-years more customer friendly and less onerous than that of most [MISC European  ] countries , which frequently require applicants to queue for hours three or four times , it has become the subject of debate now that the [ORG European Union  ] is moving forward with [LOC Schengen  ] visa liberalization for [LOC Serbia  ] . 
Given the stable situation in [LOC Serbia  ] and the relatively low refusal rate , post believes that it would be justified to consider increasing the standard validity of non-immigrant visas from the current three years to five ( reftel B ) . 
This would have a beneficial impact on our workload at a time of reduced consular staffing , while also allowing us to send a signal to the [MISC Serbian  ] people that we recognize the progress that the country has made since its democratic transition and are eager for increased engagement . 
Comment ------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Although the current [MISC Serbian  ] government is democratic and [LOC BELGRADE  ] 00000765 004 OF 004 pro-European , it is also frequently unfocused and politically timid . 
Our challenge is to make it clear that Vice President Biden’s visit wasn’t merely a reward for good behavior , but rather the start of what needs to be a much more intensive dialogue on how we can work together more closely and productively on our shared objectives .
