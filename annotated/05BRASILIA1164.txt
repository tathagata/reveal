[LOC BRASILIA  ] 464 Classified By: POLOFF BISOLA OJIKUTU , FOR REASONS 1.4B AND D. <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY . 
Tensions between small farmers , large landowners and government authorities continue to run high in the [MISC Brazilian  ] state of [LOC Para  ] , two months after the murder of [LOC US  ] citizen nun [PER Dorothy Stang  ] . 
Five suspects are in custody for [PER Stang  ] 's killing . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] Agriculture Minister relayed concerns to the Ambassador over the growing security concerns in [LOC Para  ] . 
The Chief Justice of the [LOC Para  ] state Court of Justice does not foresee any delays in the [PER Stang  ] murder trial . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In an April 25 meeting with Ambassador [PER Danilovich  ] , [MISC Brazilian  ] Agriculture Minister [PER Roberto Rodrigues  ] said that he and President [PER Lula da Silva  ] would travel to the area because of growing concerns about the security situation there . 
Minister [PER Rodrigues  ] told the Ambassador that they ( presumably large landowners ) " are getting ready to kill again " . 
[PER Rodrigues  ] added that he is aware that there are four [LOC US  ] citizen nuns still in the area . 
However , when [PER Lula  ] traveled to the area on April 27 , he merely inaugurated a biodeisel project but did not address public security issues at all. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) [LOC Brazil  ] 's [LOC Para  ] state , at the mouth of the [LOC Amazon River  ] , was the site of the February murder of [LOC US  ] citizen nun [PER Dorothy Stang  ] ( refs ) . 
Five suspects are now in custody for that killing , including two landowners , one middleman , and two alleged gunmen . 
[PER Stang  ] was long involved in activities on behalf of the landless and small farmers that drew the ire of large landowners , ranchers , and loggers in the region . 
Despite the presence of military troops , deployed to support the [ORG Federal Police  ] in the wake of the [PER Stang  ] murder , the situation in [LOC Para  ] 's rural areas remains unsettled. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Jose Sales  ] , Superintendent of the [ORG Federal Police  ] in [LOC Para  ] , told [ORG Consular Agent  ] this week that the [PER Stang  ] murder has been concluded with the five arrested suspects ( two gunmen , two middlemen , and two landowners who masterminded the conspiracy ) . 
The [ORG Federal Police  ] are no longer looking to expand the investigation to a possibly broader conspiracy of landowners. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Recently , there has been a concerted effort in some [LOC Para  ] media outlets to impugn Sister [PER Dorothy Stang  ] . 
A magazine called " [MISC Hoje  ] " ( " Today " ) published last week in the interior town of [LOC Altamira  ] ( near to where [PER Stang  ] was gunned down ) ran stinging criticisms of the nun , and local left-of-center [ORG Workers' Party  ] officials . 
[ORG Federal Police  ] supervisor [PER Sales  ] also told us that a number of clandestine radio stations in the area are running similar stories . 
[ORG Federal Prosecutor Felicio Pontes  ] has asked [PER Sales  ] to close down the pirate radio stations , but [PER Sales  ] faces bureaucratic hurdles before he can do so. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Sales  ] also shared with us his personal view that [PER Stang  ] had gone too far: she once approached [PER Sales  ] and asked him to " remove the land poachers at all costs " . 
To [MISC Sales'  ] reply that it would have to be done through legal means , she responded she would do it " her own way " . 
[PER Sales  ] recognizes that [PER Stang  ] 's high-profile public image gave courage to the landless and environmental activists , yet he doubts that other religious figures will be willing to follow her tactics. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Sales  ] estimates that only about 50% of the 1,800 [ORG Army  ] troops assigned to support the GoB 's peacekeeping efforts in [LOC Para  ] are still there --spread over an enormous and remote area . 
The military deployment , he says , was very costly , particularly with the use of helicopters and with little support in terms of lodging and logistics. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Sales  ] also commented on the role of [PER Milton Nobre  ] , Chief Justice of the [ORG State Court of Justice  ] . 
( [PER Sales  ] himself opposes the idea of " federalization " , i.e. , letting the federal courts take over the [PER Stang  ] murder trial . 
) [PER Milton Nobre  ] has just recently been elected Chief Justice of the court by his peers . 
He is dynamic , he knows what he is doing and is correcting mistakes of the past , according to [LOC Salas  ] . 
[PER Nobre  ] 's ambition is to be a federal high court justice , so he is eager to make his mark . 
[PER Sales  ] says that he knows no federal judge who would perform as well as [ORG Nobre.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Separately , Judge [PER Nobre  ] assured us that there will be no undue delays in the [PER Stang  ] murder trial and guarantees that this case will be prosecuted in record time . 
He said that , within 40 days , it will be presented before a jury . 
The case can be appealed within 30 days , he said . 
Regarding federalization , [PER Nobre  ] points out that there are only nine federal judges in [LOC Para  ] state , versus 244 state judges hence the state courts have a stronger structure for a complicated case . 
[PER Nobre  ] adds that the state courts have prosecuted major human rights cases in [LOC Para  ] in the past ( e.g. , [PER Canuto  ] , [PER Fontelles  ] , [PER Joo Batista  ] , [PER El Dourado  ] dos [PER Carajas  ] ) , although he signally did not comment on the quality of justice administered in those cases. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) In late March , EmbOffs met with Justice [PER Arnaldo Esteves  ] , the [ORG Brazilian Supreme Court  ] ( [ORG STJ  ] ) judge in charge of federalizing [PER Stang  ] 's murder case . 
[PER Esteves  ] invited the four defendants to file motions to federalize the case and expected to receive them soon . 
The [ORG STJ  ] recently told us that the motions have not yet been filed because the prosecution is still gathering evidence . 
After the motions are filed , the [ORG STJ  ] will schedule a hearing to hear oral arguments and issue a decision . 
Theoretically , if the [ORG STJ  ] decides to federalize the case , [LOC Para  ] state authorities and the defendants could appeal . 
Judge [PER Esteves  ] noted that there are no written rules or criteria for this process , and has never been done before , hence he is " inventing " the process as he goes . 
If the case is federalized , it would be heard by a federal judge and a popular jury in [LOC Para  ] . 
Whether the trial is ultimately handled by a state or federal court , he guessed that the actual murder trial would begin no earlier than July 2005 . 
COMMENT -- FOUR NUNS NOT IN IMMEDIATE DANGER --------------------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The [ORG US Consular Agent  ] in [LOC Belem  ] , the capital of [LOC Para  ] state , has alerted the [MISC Belem-based  ] " Sisters of [LOC Notre Dame  ] " , [PER Dorothy Stang  ] 's order , about our concerns about high tensions in the area . 
One of the [LOC Notre Dame  ] nuns responded that they have not suffered death threats and are not unduly concerned for their safety . 
The nun noted that there are only four [LOC US  ] citizen nuns in the area , and while one is a bit of an activist , none have anything like the public profile of [PER Dorothy Stang  ] . 
Meanwhile , Sister [PER Stang  ] 's work has been taken on by a [MISC Brazilian  ] novice to the order in the town of [LOC Anapu  ] ( where [PER Stang  ] was killed ) . 
The sisters report that the novice is recommitted to the work in the wake of [PER Stang  ] 's death . 
Post will also review [ORG Consular Information Sheet  ] with an eye to including language on rural [LOC Para  ] .
