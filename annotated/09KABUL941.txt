[PER ATMAR  ] ON POLICE TRAINING AND EXPANSION OF THE [ORG ANP  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On April 9 , [PER CODEL Tsongas  ] met with Minister [PER Hanif Atmar  ] at the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] ( [ORG MOI  ] ) . 
The Minister expressed thanks to the [LOC United States  ] for dispatching its brave uniformed military to [LOC Afghanistan  ] and for continuing [MISC American  ] support of the [ORG Afghan National Police  ] ( [ORG ANP  ] ) , often the only defense against terrorists and criminals . 
[PER Atmar  ] said that , under [ORG CSTC-A  ] 's tutelage , the [ORG ANP  ] was engaged in individual training and institution-building , with the police receiving a full package , based on the best knowledge for what they have to do . 
The three key [MISC Afghan  ] security institutions are the [ORG Afghan National Army  ] ( [ORG ANA  ] ) , the [ORG National Directorate of Security  ] ( [ORG NDS  ] ) intelligence , and the [ORG ANP  ] . 
The [ORG ANP  ] had not yet achieved the success of the other two but , with the help of [ORG CSTC-A  ] , would do so , [PER Atmar  ] said. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Atmar  ] briefly described categories of police training . 
He singled out the [ORG Focused District Development  ] ( [ORG FDD  ] ) program as the most important training provided by [ORG CSTC-A  ] to the regular [MISC Afghan  ] Uniformed Police ( [ORG AUP  ] ) . 
Under [ORG FDD  ] , local police are pulled from their districts for two months for drug testing , biometrics recording and training in basic skills . 
When redeployed , the [ORG AUP  ] units were the most critical element was the Police [PER Mentor Teams  ] ( [ORG PMT  ] ) which accompanied the police on missions , ensured that the techniques they learned stuck , and relieved their sense of isolation . 
[PER Atmar  ] commented that the [ORG ANA  ] only fought when it was sure it had the ability to do so , [PER Atmar  ] said , but the regular [ORG ANP  ] found they had no choice other than to fight . 
[PER Atmar  ] said the [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Border Police  ] ( [ORG ABP  ] ) also were training using the same principles as the [ORG AUP  ] . 
Sixteen thousand [ORG ABP  ] must receive that instruction . 
The Minister said that the most sophisticated training , however , went to the elite [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Civil Order Police  ] ( [ORG ANCOP  ] ) , which received 4 months of more intense and varied instruction. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In addition , [PER Atmar  ] said , the [ORG MOI  ] and [ORG ANP  ] received assistance on reforming traditional systems and institution-building , with an emphasis on rooting out corruption . 
Selection of the leadership , which was not previously based on merit , was under a new system . 
[PER Atmar  ] characterized the whole effort as not just training , but fundamental reform of the entire structure . 
This effort was complicated because the [ORG ANP  ] was fully occupied fighting insurgents and eradicating poppy , doing security rather than law enforcement . 
And there were insufficient resources to expand the [ORG ANP  ] rapidly in time for the August elections. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Minister [PER Atmar  ] pitched strongly for [ORG ANP  ] expansion . 
The [ORG ANP  ] , he reiterated , must take a quantum leap forward , but resources were lacking . 
[PER Atmar  ] said he received strong political support and understanding for what he was doing , such as firing and prosecuting 10 percent of the police leadership over the last four months , but he needed more trainers and mentors , as envisioned under President [PER Obama  ] 's [ORG Strategic Review  ] to create a bigger police force . 
The [ORG ANP  ] must be vastly expanded from its current size of 1.3 police for every 1000 [MISC Afghans  ] , a ratio far below other countries which do not face insurgency , narcotics , and rapidly rising crime . 
President [PER Obama  ] , he said , was clear when announcing the [ORG Strategic Review  ] outcomes that he backed expansion of the [ORG Afghanistan National Security Forces  ] ( [ORG ANSF  ] ) , but did not mention specific targets . 
There was no shortage of volunteers for the [ORG ANP  ] , which showed a measure of popular trust in the institution , but the Minister said that he needed international support to expand and train a new [ORG NCO  ] and officer corps . 
FIGHTING CORRUPTION <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Referring to an April 8 [ORG NY Times article Corruption Undercuts Hopes  ] for [MISC Afghan  ] Police , the [ORG CODEL  ] opened a discussion on that topic . 
[PER Atmar  ] said he was aware of the article and that it was ironic that in [LOC Ghazni  ] ( from where it was date-lined ) , he had fired over 60 [ORG ANP  ] , officers and [LOC KABUL  ] 00000941 002 OF 003 patrolmen , which had led to a 90 percent drop in reported corruption . 
He defended his record by nothing that several major anti-corruption initiatives were underway within the [ORG MOI  ] . 
First , he had requested the [ORG FBI  ] to build a [MISC Major Crimes Task Force  ] ( [ORG MCTF  ] ) in the [ORG MOI  ] which would become [LOC Afghanistan  ] 's [ORG FBI  ] . 
The [ORG FBI  ] agreed and had begun work , but support from the [ORG CODEL  ] and elsewhere for additional resources would help . 
Once the structure is in place , the [ORG MCTF  ] targets would go beyond senior police officers to [LOC Afghanistan  ] 's leadership in the [LOC Parliament  ] and cabinet . 
For seven years there had been much talk about bold steps to go after high-level corruption , but no resources were available , [PER Atmar  ] said . 
His invitation to the [ORG FBI  ] was to do this together with the [ORG MOI  ] until [ORG MOI  ] could do it alone. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) A second major initiative , [PER Atmar  ] said , was his plan for a 300 person [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG MOI  ] inspector general ( [ORG IG  ] ) corps to enforce accountability on personnel ghosts ( police who are carried on the rolls but not active ) , weapons , salaries and performance at the district level . 
He had asked the international community to deploy inspectors to train the [ORG IG  ] candidates for this [MISC Afghan  ] initiative , including a request he made to the [ORG U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction  ] ( [ORG SIGAR  ] ) . 
He specifically wanted 34 international auditors , one per province , who could monitor [ORG ANP  ] performance and give the public confidence in [ORG ANP  ] reform . 
There were a number of institutional corruption problems , but the key , he said , was cleaning up the police leadership . 
If that were done there would be no diversion of assets . 
To that end , he was requiring top leaders to explain their assets or risk prosecution . 
He had provided his own personal data to the [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG High Office of Oversight  ] . 
In addition , he was strengthening the police intelligence capacity to review the leadership and also asked the [ORG FBI  ] to help with polygraphing. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Atmar  ] apologized for explaining his approach on corruption at such length , but he was dealing with a historic problem . 
He had witnessed that when the [LOC U.S.  ] and others originally pressed for reform in the [ORG ANA  ] and intelligence services , anyone fired from those organizations had moved to the [ORG ANP  ] , where the [LOC U.S.  ] was not involved at the time . 
A blind eye had been turned when the focus was on the [MISC Afghan  ] Army and he was now trying to get rid of people capable of mobilizing demonstrations if they felt threatened . 
His point , he said , was that he was pursing a comprehensive strategy against corruption to bring about a cultural change , for which he needed resources . 
WOMEN IN THE [ORG ANP  ] , [ORG ANCOP  ] , AND MORE ON EXPANSION <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG CODEL  ] Tsongas pressed on a number of other topics , such as the role of women in the [ORG ANP  ] . 
[PER Atmar  ] said that there was culturally already such a role , but he was not yet training enough women , and needed an aggressive recruitment and training program for women . 
He said that he would draw on the experience of [ORG CSTC-A  ] 's [PER BG Armstrong  ] , a woman , for this program . 
There were 700 women in the [ORG ANP  ] in a taskhil of 82 thousand . 
He then used his chalkboard to outline the whole organization of the [ORG ANP  ] in greater detail Asked about the [ORG ANCOP  ] role , [PER Atmar  ] said they were gendarmerie-like police , charged with handling civil unrest ( while the [ORG AUP  ] handled community-level policing ) . 
[ORG ANCOP  ] 's special role was in the [LOC FDD  ] program . 
When [ORG AUP  ] police were overwhelmed and in need of training , [ORG ANCOP  ] substituted for them in the districts while the [ORG AUP  ] went through the [LOC FDD  ] program . 
He explained that in rural areas , the [ORG ANA  ] was often not present , so there the [ORG ANP  ] was used almost entirely for security , not law enforcement. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Atmar  ] turned the conversation back to [ORG ANP  ] expansion , estimating that he needed roughly a doubling of the [ORG ANP  ] in two years , preferably one , to fight a brutal enemy and simultaneously reform the police and ministry . 
He illustrated the brutality of the enemy by recounting the story of how early in 2009 young girls had had acid sprayed in their faces while walking to school . 
He asserted that this was the work of a [LOC Pakistan  ] army major who had paid assailants USD 2000 for every girl sprayed . 
[ORG Taliban  ] crossing from [LOC Pakistan  ] were armed with heavy machine guns , which made the [ORG ANP  ] sitting ducks . 
He acknowledged that he was training soldiers , not police in the traditional sense , but that was necessary under the circumstances . 
The equipment provided by the [LOC U.S.  ] was welcome , and indeed , for the first time ever the [MISC Aghanistan  ] people welcomed foreign troops , not simply because the [ORG Taliban  ] were so bad , but because the values shown by [MISC American  ] soldiers were admirable . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] had provided eight major training centers , and there were other sites around the country , including a police academy in [LOC Kabul  ] , but still more help was required . 
His dream project , he said , was to staff the academy with [LOC U.S.  ] trainers as faculty members , including women officers . 
[LOC KABUL  ] 00000941 003 OF 003 WHO ELSE IS HELPING ON POLICE TRAINING ? <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Asked which other countries could or were helping with police training , [PER Atmar  ] rattled off an answer . 
[LOC France  ] was particularly good , but its offer was small . 
[LOC Italy  ] was a relatively large contributor ( a distant second after the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) with its carbinieri trainers . 
[LOC Canada  ] was small and centered on [LOC Kandahar  ] . 
The [LOC U.K.  ] focused more on counter-narcotics . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] were good , but too few in numbers . 
[LOC Germany  ] was a fantastic contributor to many aspects of the [ORG ANP  ] , but also too small a contingent . 
From [MISC Islamic  ] neighboring nations only money was needed . 
The picture was captured when you considered that of the 55 [LOC FDD  ] districts , all were partnered by the [LOC U.S.  ] except 4-5 by other nations . 
[PER Atmar  ] concluded by saying increasing the size of the [ORG ANP  ] before elections was pressing . 
[MISC Afghans  ] are willing to join the [ORG ANP  ] as soldiers , gendarmerie , or community police , but the money , training spaces , and trainers are not yet available . 
When Congressman said a constituent in [LOC Duchess County  ] who had lost a brother on his third tour of service had urged him to make it worth it , [PER Atmar  ] said that was absolutely right . 
Every night , he said , he looked at the [ORG ANP  ] losses and felt an ethical responsibility to build a prepared and reformed [ORG ANP  ] . 
This was a winnable goal if the right decisions were made. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( U ) Participants: Minister [PER Atmar  ] was accompanied to this meeting by his Chief of Staff , Mr. Wayand , and a military aide . 
On the [LOC U.S.  ] side , Rep. [PER Niki Tsongas  ] ( [ORG D-MA  ] ) , Rep. [PER John Hall  ] ( [ORG D-NY  ] ) , Rep. [PER Larry Kissell  ] ( [ORG D-NC  ] ) , Rep. [PER Jared Polis  ] ( [ORG D-CO  ] ) , Rep. [PER Joe Wilson  ] ( [ORG R-SC  ] ) , Rep. [PER Jason Chaffetz  ] ( [ORG R-UT  ] ) , Staff members [PER Bob DeGrasse  ] and [PER Josh Holly  ] , [ORG CDA  ] Ambassador [PER Frank Ricciardone  ] , [ORG CSTC-A  ] BG [PER Anne Macdonald  ] , and [ORG Embassy POL-MIL  ] Counselor [PER Bob Clarke  ] participated. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( U ) [ORG CODEL  ] [PER Tsongas  ] did not review this cable before departure .
