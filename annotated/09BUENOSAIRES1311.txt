( C ) Summary: The [ORG GOA  ] responded with heavy artillery to a remark [ORG WHA A/S Valenzuela  ] made during a December 16 press roundtable . 
Immediately after the press roundtable , [MISC Argentine  ] media started focusing almost exclusively on [ORG A/S Valenzuela’s  ] remark that the [MISC American  ] business community in [LOC Argentina  ] had conveyed to him concern about rule of law and management of the economy in [LOC Argentina  ] . 
The press reported that [PER Valenzuela  ] contrasted these concerns “with the enthusiasm and investment intentions” of the [MISC American  ] business community in 1996 . 
[ORG GOA  ] officials also expressed their dissatisfaction with the remarks . 
The Ambassador and other [ORG Country Team  ] members used a December 17 reception for journalists to stress our desire to work constructively with [LOC Argentina  ] , and the Ambassador has reached out to [ORG GOA  ] officials to urge a prompt end to their criticisms . 
Government press is beginning to report a softening tone , but we think that it is too early to tell . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Immediately prior to departure from [LOC Buenos Aires  ] on December 16 , [ORG WHA A/S Valenzuela  ] met at the Embassy with about a dozen [MISC Argentine  ] print journalists . 
He followed 20 minutes of remarks by taking questions for another 20 minutes , explaining his desire to introduce himself to his regional counterparts and undertake a dialogue with them on regional developments . 
Media Zero In on Perceived Criticism -------------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Despite the broad range of issues addressed by [PER A/S Valenzuela  ] , [MISC Argentine  ] media started focusing immediately after the roundtable almost exclusively on [ORG A/S Valenzuela’s  ] remark that the [MISC American  ] business community in [LOC Argentina  ] had conveyed to him concern about rule of law and management of the economy in [LOC Argentina  ] . 
The press also reported that [PER Valenzuela  ] contrasted these concerns “with the enthusiasm and investment intentions” of the [MISC American  ] business community in 1996 . 
( [PER A/S Valenzuela’s  ] first official meeting in [LOC Buenos Aires  ] was with the [ORG Executive Board of the AmCham  ] . 
) As an example of the sensationalist nature of much of the reporting , [MISC La Nacion’s  ] banner front-page headlines on December 17 read , “Clash with the [LOC U.S.  ] over [ORG Rule of Law in Argentina”  ] and on December 18 , “Protest to [LOC U.S.  ] over [MISC Obama Envoy’s  ] [PER Criticism.”  ] [PER Kirchner Allies  ] Take Umbrage ------------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOA  ] response came swiftly . 
That same night , three [ORG GOA  ] ministries publicly commented ( in a clearly coordinated fashion ) on the [PER Valenzuela  ] remarks . 
Interior Minister [PER Florencio Randazzo  ] said “Argentina is enjoying a phase of complete institutional and legal guarantees . 
The country has left behind the times when a foreign official could come and say what needed to be done . 
There is no lack of rule of law . 
The difference now is that the Government protects the people , and in the 1990s it protected the companies’ interests that took millions out.” <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Following the [PER Randazzo  ] statement , the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] issued a four-point communiquC ) saying that: ( 1 ) the generalized nature of the Assistant Secretary’s remarks about supposed concerns in the [MISC American  ] business community made it impossible for the [ORG GOA  ] to address the alleged concerns ; ( 2 ) the [ORG MFA  ] had already written Ambassador [PER Martinez  ] to clarify similar remarks that she had made the previous week in [LOC Cordoba  ] but had received no reply ; ( 3 ) [MISC Argentine  ] authorities had received no complaints from [MISC American  ] companies operating in [LOC Argentina  ] ; and ( 4 ) the [ORG GOA  ] reiterates its disposition to analyze “all aspects that allow us to promote reciprocal relations , especially economic , between the two countries . 
Open and consolidated channels are available to both governments for this dialogue.” <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [MISC GOA’s  ] third statement on December 16 came from Justice Minister [PER Julio Alak  ] , who called [MISC Valenzuela’s  ] statements “unusual and unjustified.” [PER Alak  ] claimed that “rule of law is a fundamental asset in the country that has been protected and rescued from the more adverse conditions coming from the institutional and economic crisis in 2001 and 2002.” <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) After the initial salvos , the [ORG GOA  ] officials who met with [PER Valenzuela  ] chimed in . 
Vice Foreign Minister [PER Victorio Taccetti  ] ( who received [PER Valenzuela  ] December 15 at the [ORG MFA  ] and hosted him for lunch ) said , “Valenzuela is free to think as he wishes , but the truth is that 1996 is the prelude of the most important crisis [LOC Argentina  ] faced . 
It is possible that he felt glad in 1996 , but that ended in the 2001 crisis that impacted many companies , including some [MISC American  ] ones . 
[LOC Argentina  ] doesn’t want to set off sparks ( “sacarse chispas” ) with the [LOC United States  ] ; it is [PER Valenzuela  ] who opines without basing his statements on reality.” <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Cabinet Chief [PER AnC-bal FernC  ] ! ndez said , “We are not talking about a statement that comes from [MISC American  ] businessmen , but of ( [MISC Valenzuela’s  ] ) prejudices , and that is much more sensitive and what worries me most . 
I was concerned to find out that he was critical of many [MISC Latin American  ] democracies , and one of the supporters of the [LOC Washington  ] Consensus.” <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [MISC Argentine  ] Ambassador to the [LOC United States  ] HC ) ctor [PER Timerman  ] appeared on television and in the press to claim that he had urged A/S [PER Valenzuela  ] to meet with [ORG CGT  ] labor leader [PER Hugo Moyano  ] and the opposition [ORG Radical Party  ] ( [ORG UCR  ] ) , but that “he met only with the political right: [PER De NarvC  ] ! ez , [PER Macri  ] and [PER Cobos  ] . 
He is sending a message on who are , in his views , the people with whom he needs to have dialogue.” <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [MISC Argentine  ] press reported that FM [PER Jorge Taiana  ] , who was in [LOC Copenhagen  ] for the [MISC COP-15  ] meetings , used a brief pull-aside with Secretary [PER Clinton  ] to complain about [MISC Valenzuela’s  ] remarks . 
[PER Taiana  ] told the press that [MISC Valenzuela’s  ] words “were unfortunate and show his ignorance of the [MISC Argentine  ] reality . 
His reference to the administration of [PER Menem  ] as a time of great growth , when it was precisely the time when [LOC Argentina  ] was hurling headlong toward its worst crisis in history , like a train with no brakes , was even more unfortunate.” <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Former president [PER Nestor Kirchner  ] said “the statements by someone who should come with a different policy for [LOC Latin America  ] are deplorable . 
[PER Valenzuela  ] belongs to the groups that participated in the [LOC Washington  ] Consensus ; the neo-liberal model that caused so much damage to the whole region.” [PER Kirchner  ] ally Deputy [PER AgustC-n Rossi  ] ( leader of the [LOC FpV bloc  ] in the Chamber ) said “Valenzuela’s visit was not encouraging . 
We thought the time when foreign officials came to lecture us was over.” Regarding [MISC Valenzuela’s  ] comparison of the current reality with the one in the 1990s , he said: “it is a fallacy to say we were better with Menem’s administration ; the cracks of the convertibility plan were evident and led [LOC Argentina  ] to bankruptcy.” The leader of the [LOC FpV bloc  ] in the [ORG Senate  ] , [PER Miguel Pichetto  ] , said “Valenzuela keeps adding mistakes to the [LOC U.S.  ] relation to [LOC Latin America  ] , because a diplomat visiting a country should be much more cautious when commenting on our domestic politics and the economic recovery our government achieved.” A couple of days later , at a December 20 political rally , [PER Nestor Kirchner  ] said “disrespectful viceroys” should first criticize what was happening in the [LOC United States  ] . 
He blamed [MISC Argentina’s  ] loss of rule of law on the [LOC U.S.  ] crisis that “left millions of [MISC Americans  ] without their jobs , homes or savings.” Opposition is Divided ------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Reaction among the opposition was divided . 
Some , such as [LOC Santa Fe  ] governor [PER Hermes Binner  ] , a highly regarded moderate Socialist and possible presidential candidate , said that [MISC Valenzuela’s  ] remarks tracked very closely with complaints that , they , too had heard from the business community . 
Others , such as Socialist Senator [PER Ruben Giustiniani  ] , who usually coincides with [PER Binner  ] , objected to any foreign official relaying any criticism of [LOC Argentina  ] , while [MISC Radical  ] congressional deputy [PER Ricardo AlfonsC-n  ] took issue with what he interpreted as [PER Valenzuela’s  ] praise for [PER Menem  ] policies in the 1990s: “We , the [MISC Argentines  ] , know that during those years there was a looting of national assets . 
For us , it was a disaster.” However , the head of the [ORG Radical Party  ] ( [ORG UCR  ] ) , Senator [PER Ernesto Sanz  ] ( who joined [MISC Valenzuela’s  ] December 16 lunch with Vice President [PER Cobos  ] ) said “it seems it was necessary that a foreigner come to say this . 
We have been denouncing the lack of rule of law from [ORG Congress  ] for four or five years . 
With each law the [MISC Kirchnerists  ] passed , ( the country ) moved one step towards a lack of rule of law.” Another prominent opposition leader , Deputy [PER Margarita Stolbizer  ] ( GEN ) , said , “Unfortunately , [PER Valenzuela  ] is right . 
This government condemned us to isolation because of lack of rule of law , and [PER Valenzuela  ] only relayed how the world sees us.” Leftist congressional deputy and film director [PER Pino Solanas  ] ( [ORG Proyecto Sur Bloc Leader  ] ) said , “I strongly repudiate [PER Arturo Valenzuela’s  ] statements . 
He is the envoy of the empire whose government has legitimized the coup in [LOC Honduras  ] . 
Mr. [PER Valenzuela  ] represents the government that keeps thinking the disastrous and tragic 1990s for [LOC Argentina  ] are a model to follow.” Embassy Works to Smooth Feathers ------------------------------------------ <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) The Ambassador and other [ORG Country Team  ] members used a December 17 reception for journalists to stress our desire to work constructively with [LOC Argentina  ] , stressing our common interests and extensive cooperation . 
The [MISC Ambassador’s  ] conciliatory remarks received broad press play . 
The Ambassador called [PER VFM Taccetti  ] , who offered her a long explanation of why the [ORG GOA  ] in the wake of the 2001-02 crisis had been forced to “pesify” contracts that had been denominated in dollars at a new exchange rate that was disadvantageous to foreign businesses . 
( Note: “Pesification” has been a common theme of many of the complaints that [LOC U.S.  ] investors took to the [MISC World Bank’s International Court  ] for the [ORG Settlement of Investment Disputes  ] . 
) Those pesified contracts nonetheless continued to be profitable , [PER Taccetti  ] claimed . 
He said [MISC Argentina’s  ] current challenge , however , was to maintain employment levels , which explained the [ORG GOA  ] position regarding Kraft and other labor disputes . 
[PER Taccetti  ] asked if [LOC Washington  ] could issue a conciliatory statement . 
The Ambassador also requested a meeting with Cabinet Chief [PER Anibal Fernandez  ] to urge a prompt end to [ORG GOA  ] public complaining about A/S [MISC Valenzuela’s  ] remarks . 
Press reported widely A/S [MISC Valenzuela’s  ] clarification ( delivered at his next stop , [LOC Montevideo  ] ) that he was merely relaying some concerns expressed to him by [MISC American  ] businesses operating in [LOC Argentina  ] . 
[ORG GOA  ] Tones Down Its Commentary -------------------------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOA’s Telam  ] news service sent December 18 a story that led with “Cabinet Chief [PER Anibal Fernandez  ] sought today to lower the tone on the controversy generated by ( [MISC Valenzuela’s  ] ) remarks.” The wire story quoted [PER Fernandez  ] saying he had “a very good conversation with [PER Valenzuela  ] on important topics , and [PER Valenzuela  ] never mentioned concerns about rule of law.” [PER Fernandez  ] claimed that [PER Valenzuela  ] had several years ago made similar claims about [MISC Argentine  ] rule of law , suggesting a predisposition to judge [LOC Argentina.  ] “But this man is not the [LOC United States  ] , no matter how important he is . 
The [LOC United States  ] is the United [MISC States.” Another  ] wire service reported that [PER VFM Taccetti  ] said “This topic has already passed . 
Maybe ( [PER Valenzuela  ] ) knows why he said it . 
We think it’s absurd . 
We are looking straight ahead.. . 
I think the points of agreement between [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Argentina  ] were aired in the meetings we had . 
No one else in the region has been more firm on [LOC Iran  ] . 
We are working in [LOC Haiti..  ] . 
The agreements are notable . 
In general , [LOC U.S.  ] policies and ours on international matters are in agreement.” [ORG AmCham  ] Pleased with Press Coverage --------------------------------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [ORG AmCham  ] told post’s Commercial Counselor that it was taking a positive response to press inquiries , talking up the positive contributions their members make to [MISC Argentina’s  ] economy and their desire for dialogue with the [ORG GOA  ] on the business and investment climate . 
Subsequently , some [ORG AmCham  ] members told us privately that they were pleased a high-ranking [LOC U.S.  ] diplomat publicly relayed their concerns . 
The [ORG AmCham  ] President said he intended to take advantage of the opening offered by the [MISC MFA’s  ] request for specific concerns about the business climate by sending the [ORG MFA  ] letter requesting a meeting to review concerns in detail . 
Comment ---------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) Once again , the [PER Kirchner  ] government has shown itself to be extremely thin-skinned and intolerant of perceived criticism . 
Concerns about the weakness of [MISC Argentina’s  ] institutions , and the rule of law in particular , are a dime a dozen in the [MISC Argentine  ] press , voiced by academics , business leaders , judges , opposition politicians , pundits , and [ORG NGOs  ] . 
[MISC Argentines  ] are well aware that [LOC Argentina  ] is not attracting as much investment as are [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Chile  ] , and others in the region . 
The business community’s anxiety about arbitrary and capricious rule changes is well known to the [MISC Argentine  ] public and the government . 
Only die-hard kirchneristas will agree with Randazzo’s assertion that [LOC Argentina  ] enjoys “full institutional and juridical guarantees , ” or the [MISC MFA’s  ] contention that it is unaware of any dissatisfaction on the part of any [MISC American  ] company . 
For most [MISC Argentines  ] , those are laugh lines or cynically disingenuous statements . 
That said , we hope that this contretemps will soon peter out , as has happened in similar such episodes in the past. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 .
