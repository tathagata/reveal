( C ) Peace Commissioner [PER Restrepo  ] told us the [ORG GOC  ] has reached out to establish direct contact with the [ORG FARC  ] , but does not feel any pressure to move quickly on a peace process . 
The [ORG GOC  ] believes [PER Cano  ] is isolated from other [ORG Secretariat  ] members , and will continue military efforts to kill or capture him . 
[PER Restrepo  ] said the [ORG GOC  ] must force [PER Cano  ] to understand that negotiations offer the only way out for the [ORG FARC  ] ( and for him ) ; the [ORG GOC  ] is prepared to provide [PER Cano  ] and other [ORG FARC  ] leaders a " dignified " exit . 
Despite ruling out further international facilitation , [PER Restrepo  ] said the [ORG GOC  ] could consider an international accompaniment or verification role once a serious process begins . 
The [ORG GOC  ] remains willing to talk with the [ORG ELN  ] , but sees little prospect as long as [ORG ELN  ] leaders reside in [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
End summary . 
[ORG FARC  ] REJECTS [ORG GOC  ] TALKS--SUGGESTS [LOC NICARAGUA  ] ------------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) The [ORG FARC Secretariat  ] issued a letter June 26 that stated the group would not directly negotiate with the [ORG GOC  ] , and instead wanted a meeting with [MISC Nicaraguan  ] President [PER Daniel Ortega  ] to discuss " issues of war and peace . 
" The letter , addressed to [PER Ortega  ] , thanked " Commandante [PER Daniel  ] " for his " support through these difficult moments " and for providing asylum to two [ORG FARC  ] fighters brought to [LOC Nicaragua  ] after the March 1 attack against [ORG FARC  ] number two [PER Raul Reyes  ] in [LOC Ecuador  ] . 
In a July 5 communique , the [ORG Secretariat  ] admitted that the [ORG GOC  ] 's July 2 rescue of 15 hostages was a " reversal , " but insisted the group would continue its fight . 
The [ORG Secretariat  ] reiterated its interest in a humanitarian exchange of " political " hostages for [ORG FARC  ] members captured by the [ORG GOC  ] , but did not mention its long-standing demand that talks on such an exchange be conditioned on the [ORG GOC  ] 's demilitarization of [LOC Pradera  ] and [LOC Florida  ] municipalities . 
[ORG GOC  ] REMAINS READY TO TALK ------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Peace Commissioner [PER Luis Carlos Restrepo  ] told us July 11 that the [ORG GOC  ] remains committed to pursuing direct talks with the [ORG FARC  ] and has reached out to [ORG FARC  ] leader [PER Alfonso Cano  ] ( reftel ) . 
If the [ORG FARC  ] responds positively to the [ORG GOC  ] overture , the [ORG GOC  ] will send an emissary to lay the groundwork for an eventual [MISC FARC-Restrepo  ] meeting . 
The [ORG GOC  ] would not insist on a [ORG FARC  ] release of hostages as condition for talks , because the [ORG GOC  ] knows the [ORG FARC  ] would not accept this . 
Still , [PER Restrepo  ] said the [ORG GOC  ] does not feel any need to move quickly on talks with the group . 
Instead , it will try to establish contact and allow [PER Cano  ] to analyze his deteriorating situation . 
[PER Restrepo  ] stressed that the [ORG GOC  ] will continue military operations to kill or capture [PER Cano  ] . 
The [ORG GOC  ] needs to force [PER Cano  ] to understand that talks are the [ORG FARC  ] 's ( and his ) only way out . 
INTERNAL [ORG FARC  ] PROBLEMS AS OBSTACLE ---------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Restrepo  ] said [PER Cano  ] remains isolated , and has little support from , or contact with , other members of the [ORG Secretariat  ] . 
The isolation creates opportunities that the [ORG GOC  ] may be able to exploit , especially if military pressure can further break [ORG FARC  ] command and control systems . 
The [ORG GOC  ] is prepared to offer [PER Cano  ] and other [ORG FARC  ] leaders a " dignified " way out of the armed struggle , but does not want to fall into the trap of allowing the [ORG FARC  ] to use peace talks to rebuild its military capacity . 
[PER Restrepo  ] said a major obstacle to a successful peace process is [PER Cano  ] 's continued commitment to a " [MISC Leninist  ] " approach to politics . 
GOC: POSSIBLE FUTURE ROLES FOR INTERMEDIARIES --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOC  ] does not need or want international or domestic facilitators with the [ORG FARC  ] , but has not ruled out a future international " accompaniment " or verification role if the [ORG FARC  ] begins to negotiate in good faith . 
[PER Restrepo  ] said that [MISC Operation  ] " Checkmate " freed the [ORG GOC  ] from [MISC French  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] pressure to advance on an humanitarian accord . 
He added that [PER Alvaro Leyva  ] , [PER Carlos Lozano  ] , [MISC Frenchman  ] [PER Noel Saenz  ] , and [MISC Swiss  ] [ORG BOGOTA  ] 00002578 002 OF 002 [PER Jean Pierre Gontard  ] had not been reliable facilitators. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Restrepo  ] said the [MISC French  ] accepted the [ORG GOC  ] 's revocation of their facilitation role with more grace than the [MISC Swiss  ] , who insisted on continued engagement . 
On June 15 , Prosecutor General [PER Mario Iguaran  ] announced an investigation against [PER Gontard  ] for allegedly carrying $500,000 in cash for the [ORG FARC  ] . 
The [MISC Swiss  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] issued a press release on July 14 denying the charges and calling on the [ORG GOC  ] to " cease its attacks " against [PER Gontard  ] . 
GOC: [ORG ELN  ] INCAPABLE OF TAKING DECISION ON PEACE --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Vice Minister of Defense [PER Sergio Jaramillo  ] told us a successful peace process with the [ORG ELN  ] remains impossible , because [ORG ELN  ] leaders lack the capacity to take decisions and do not control the group 's armed fronts . 
The [ORG ELN  ] remains weak militarily , but some fronts in [LOC Arauca  ] , [LOC Cauca  ] , and [PER Narino  ] have strengthened due to their heavy involvement in narcotrafficking . 
[PER Jaramillo  ] said the [ORG ELN  ] is better than the [ORG FARC  ] at political organizing , but added that its leaders do not have a vision of what role they might play in a democratic [LOC Colombia.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Restrepo  ] said key [ORG ELN  ] leaders view [MISC Colombian  ] realities through a [MISC Venezuelan  ] lens and therefore feel little pressure to move on peace . 
Moreover , they will not enter into a peace process that is not linked to the [ORG FARC  ] . 
[PER Restrepo  ] said [ORG ELN  ] fronts cooperate with the [ORG FARC  ] on narcotrafficking in some areas , and maintain a political profile in [LOC Arauca  ] , [LOC Catatumbo  ] , [PER Narino  ] , and southern [PER Choco  ] due to narcotrafficking . 
[ORG ELN  ] leaders continue to pursue their old strategy of seeking contact with civil society and the international community instead of with the [ORG GOC  ] . 
Still , [PER Restrepo  ] said the [ORG GOC  ] would meet with the [ORG ELN  ] if an opportunity presented itself--a scenario which would likely only occur if [ORG ELN  ] leaders were forced to leave [LOC Venezuela  ] .
