( c ) SUMMARY: In July , the [ORG USG  ] provided the [ORG GoS  ] with eleven recommendations designed to advance the hunt for [PER Ratko Mladic  ] . 
Due primarily to the resistance of PM [PER Kostunica  ] himself , the [ORG GoS  ] has not carried out in full a single one of our recommendations ( two have been , arguably , partially initiated ) . 
In fact , [PER Kostunica  ] has literally brushed aside our recommendations , telling [PER A/S Fried  ] recently that [LOC Serbia  ] “does not need two action plans.” With a constitutional referendum and follow-on elections likely to dominate the political calendar for the next several months , [ORG Action Plan  ] coordinator [PER Rasim Ljajic  ] has told us frankly that we should not expect any more public activity on the issue , though he says below-the-radar operational activities will continue. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( c ) Moreover , [PER Carla del Ponte  ] has sharply criticized the ineffectiveness of [ORG GoS  ] implementation of the “Action Plan” [LOC Serbia  ] negotiated this summer with [ORG ICTY  ] and has told us that the PM has demonstrated no political will to take the steps necessary to bring about [MISC Mladic’s  ] arrest . 
By contrast , the PM declared over the weekend that [LOC Serbia  ] has done “absolutely everything” to cooperate with [ORG ICTY  ] and criticized the [MISC EU’s  ] “irrational” approach on [LOC Hague  ] conditionality . 
Below is an assessment of the GOS’ response to our eleven recommendations . 
END SUMMARY Proposal 1: [PER Kostunica  ] publicly calls for [MISC Mladic’s  ] immediate arrest and instructs all [MISC Serbian  ] government officials to do their utmost to accomplish this goal , stating that those that obstruct this goal will be immediately removed from their position . 
[PER Kostunica  ] asks for the public’s help in this effort and ensures that the government’s hotline number is widely publicized . 
Status: In the three months since the [ORG Action Plan  ] was initiated , [PER Kostunica  ] has said twice in prepared written statements ( one delivered orally ) that [PER Mladic  ] should be “brought in and handed over” to [ORG ICTY  ] ( i.e. , he shied away from using the word “arrest , ” despite explicitly assuring the Ambassador that he would do so ) . 
Within those two statements , he tempered his calls by also criticizing [MISC Bosnia’s  ] “mockery of justice” in not apprehending former [ORG BiH General Dudakovic  ] for crimes committed against [MISC Serbs  ] . 
[PER Kostunica  ] has made no appeal for public assistance in the [PER Mladic  ] hunt , has not publicly called upon his security services to find and arrest [PER Mladic  ] , nor publicly threatened to sanction individuals assisting in [MISC Mladic’s  ] flight from justice . 
In our opinion , and that of [PER Ljajic  ] and Deputy PM Dulic-Markovic , neither the PM nor the government has made a sustained effort to address our first proposal . 
Ideally , we would want to see [PER Kostunica  ] launch a sustained effort with a nationally-televised , [PER Oval Office-type  ] address to the nation to make the points mentioned in our recommendation . 
Proposal 2 . 
[PER Kostunica  ] , along with Interior Minister [PER Jocic  ] , issues PUBLIC instructions to all security units throughout [LOC Serbia  ] to dedicate full resources to arresting [PER Mladic  ] . 
Status: This has not been done and is not currently planned . 
Proposal 3 . 
[MISC Serbian  ] security forces initiate an effective manhunt along the lines of [ORG U.S. Marshal Service  ] recommendations for such efforts . 
Status: This has not been done and is not currently planned . 
The [ORG U.S. Marshals  ] provided a detailed briefing to Minister [PER Jocic  ] in 2005 , including specific recommendations on the structure and hierarchy of an effective task force . 
It is our assessment , and that of [ORG ICTY  ] , that the gaps in cooperation among the security services ( [ORG BIA  ] , [ORG VBA  ] , and [ORG MUP  ] ) and the lack of more results are at least in significant measure due to the loose and ineffective operational structure the [ORG GOS  ] has put in place . 
Operational efforts remain largely as they were prior to the announcement of the [ORG Action Plan  ] . 
Proposal 4 . 
[PER Kostunica  ] privately calls on the [MISC Serbian  ] Orthodox Church to publicly support the arrest/transfer of [PER Mladic  ] . 
Status: This has not been done and is not currently planned . 
Proposal 5 . 
Headed by the PM and President [PER Tadic  ] , [MISC Serbian  ] military intelligence ( [ORG VBA  ] ) shares the classified briefing given recently at the country’s [ORG Supreme Defense Council  ] with [ORG U.S.  ] Ambassador and selected [ORG EU  ] ambassadors . 
That briefing should include a comprehensive list of people known or suspected to have supported [PER Mladic  ] , as well as his whereabouts up until the present day and [ORG GoS  ] efforts to apprehend him . 
Status: This has not been done and is not currently planned . 
Proposal 6 . 
Justice Minister [PER Stojkovic  ] announces the opening of a formal investigation into [PER Mladic  ] supporters based in part on the findings of the [ORG Republika Srpska Truth Commission  ] report on [LOC Srebrenica  ] , which includes a detailed list of people involved in or supporting the [LOC Srebrenica  ] massacre , including [PER Mladic  ] and his support network . 
The focus of this investigation should be to identify current [PER Mladic  ] supporters . 
Status: This has not been done and is not currently planned . 
In fact , Stojkovic’s efforts on [ORG ICTY  ] since July have been largely counterproductive . 
For instance , he opposed the [MISC War Crimes  ] Prosecutor’s effort to introduce legislation that would give him jurisdiction over aiders and abettors of [ORG ICTY  ] fugitives . 
Proposal 7 . 
As part of the above investigation , those suspected of supporting [PER Mladic  ] or having information on [MISC Mladic’s  ] support network will immediately be brought in for questioning , and if appropriate , detained . 
This would include senior figures such as former head of military intelligence [PER Aca Tomic  ] , former Army Chief of [PER Staff Krga  ] , and [PER Mladic  ] son [PER Darko Mladic  ] . 
They should be held for questioning on the same basis , as appropriate , as those currently in detention ( former lower level [PER Mladic  ] supporters wrapped up in the past several months ) . 
Status: This has not been done . 
[PER Ljajic  ] told us eight weeks ago it was planned , but it never happened . 
[PER Tomic  ] is believed to have been close to [PER Kostunica  ] , including during the period that [PER Tomic  ] was involved in protecting [PER Mladic  ] in [LOC Serbia  ] . 
Proposal 8 . 
[PER Kostunica  ] proposes to parliament a new law that imposes additional criminal penalties on anyone found to be assisting [MISC PIFWCs  ] in any way , including financially . 
Status: This has not been done . 
In fact , Kostunica’s government initially opposed this legislation when proposed by the [MISC War Crimes Prosecutor  ] . 
Only following high-level interventions by [ORG USG  ] and [ORG ICTY  ] officials has [PER Kostunica  ] offered to introduce such legislation - an offer del [PER Ponte  ] dismissed as insignificant given that the [MISC Serbian  ] parliament is not slated to meet anytime soon . 
Proposal 9 . 
The Government of [LOC Serbia  ] prepares and makes available to the general public a report on [PER Mladic  ] , containing especially information about war crimes he is accused of committing . 
Status: This has not been done . 
Kostunica’s government has done basically nothing to place [MISC Mladic’s  ] crimes in context . 
Indeed , before the tenth anniversary of the [LOC Srebrenica  ] massacre in 2005 , Kostunica’s party blocked a special parliamentary resolution that would have condemned the massacre ; [PER Kostunica  ] argued that such a resolution would be inappropriate if it omitted an equal condemnation of crimes against [MISC Serbs  ] . 
[PER Ljajic  ] told us he planned to “leak” information about [MISC Mladic’s  ] alleged atrocities and his massive financial gains from the [LOC Bosnia  ] war to local press to start “demythologizing” him , but this never happened and , according to [PER Ljajic  ] , is no longer being planned . 
Proposal 10 . 
[PER Kostunica  ] forms an interagency task force within [LOC Serbia  ] headed by the Special Prosecutor for [MISC War Crimes  ] , which will be responsible for the location and apprehension of [PER Mladic  ] and other high-priority fugitive indictees . 
All personnel on the task force should be properly vetted to ensure that no investigations or the mission of the task force will be compromised . 
Status: This recommendation has been only incompletely fulfilled . 
The task force , put in place at the behest of [ORG ICTY  ] in the course of negotiations over the “Action Plan” ( i.e. , not in response to the [ORG USG  ] recommendation ) , lacks the sort of centralized , well-resourced structure that the [ORG U.S. Marshals  ] recommended . 
[MISC War Crimes Prosecutor  ] Vukcevic is broadly coordinating operational activities , but [ORG ICTY  ] has assessed that this has not led to a substantial change in the form or the intensity of the effort . 
Proposal 11 . 
[LOC Serbia  ] helps establish and actively participates in a regional task force to coordinate efforts among the various law enforcement and intelligence agencies throughout the region to find and apprehend persons wanted for war crimes . 
Status: An initiative in this direction has been launched , and one meeting has been held . 
According to [PER Ljajic  ] , there is some evidence that [MISC Bosnian  ] security agencies and [ORG BIA  ] are cooperating on some surveillance activities. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( c ) CONCLUSION: In all , at most one or two of our eleven proposals have been partly addressed . 
The most critical element of the proposals - a consistent , concerted effort by [PER Kostunica  ] and the government to make the public aware that they are serious about tracking down and arresting [PER Mladic  ] - has not been initiated . 
Yet on October 14 , [PER Kostunica  ] told local press that “Serbia has done absolutely everything to complete cooperation with the [LOC Hague  ] tribunal.” Based on what we have seen to date , we cannot concur with that rosy assessment .
