<code><pre>Monday , 09 February 2009 , 14:53 S E C R E T [ORG ASMARA  ] 000047 DEPARTMENT FOR AF/EX AND AF/E EO 12958 DECL: 02/02/2019 TAGS PREL , PTER , [LOC ECON  ] , ER SUBJECT: AN [MISC ERITREAN  ] OVERTURE TO THE [LOC UNITED STATES  ] REF: [ORG ASMARA  ] 35 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Ronald K. McMullen  ] for reason 1.4 ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: Senior [MISC Eritrean  ] officials in recent weeks have signaled their interest in re-engaging with the [LOC United States  ] in areas of mutual interest . 
They have done so by loosening restrictions on Embassy [ORG Asmara  ] ( [ORG REF  ] ) , by engaging in more diplomatic interaction with embassy personnel , by ending the daily anti-American diatribes in state-owned media , by sending congratulatory letters to President [PER Obama  ] and Secretary [PER Clinton  ] , and by authorizing over $100,000 to support ongoing [LOC U.S.  ] medical volunteer programs such as Physicians for Peace . 
Senior officials invited the ambassador and his wife to spend a day on a family farm , the Defense Minister attended a representational event at the [ORG CMR  ] , and [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] officials tell us [PER Isaias  ] himself helped draft a white paper on re-engaging the [LOC United States  ] . 
Post has bluntly told key officials that [MISC Eritrean  ] support for [MISC Somali  ] extremists precludes a more normal bilateral relationship and warned that an al-Shabaab attack against the [LOC United States  ] would trigger a strong and swift [MISC American  ] reaction . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) A PICNIC WITH THE “AMERICAN MAFIA” ----------------------------------------- Members of [ORG Eritrea’s “American Mafia  ] , ” senior party and government officials who speak fluent [MISC English  ] and have lived in the [LOC United States  ] , have taken the lead in signaling [MISC Eritrea’s  ] interest in improved relations . 
On February 7 , for example , the ambassador and his wife were invited to spend the day on the family farm of [PER Hagos Ghebrehewit  ] , the ruling party’s economic director ( and architect of [MISC Eritrea’s  ] imploding economy ) . 
[PER Hagos  ] , formerly a green card holder , was [MISC Eritrea’s  ] first ambassador to the [LOC United States  ] . 
Also present were the minister of health ( an [MISC American  ] citizen ) , the current [MISC Eritrean  ] ambassador to the [LOC United States  ] , and the party’s political director , [PER Yemane Ghebreab  ] . 
Lunch was served in a rocky gulch beneath a thorny acacia tree . 
The ambassador and his wife were treated to grilled sheep innards served with honey and chili sauce ( but no silverware ) , washed down with a sour , semi-fermented traditional drink called , aptly , “sewa.” The other guests chided [PER Hagos  ] , only half jokingly , for his inability to run an economy , noting that [ORG Eritrea’s Coca-Cola  ] plant and national brewery were both shuttered. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) THE DEFENSE MINISTER CELEBRATES GROUNDHOG DAY --------------------------------------------- ------- Defense Minister [PER Sebhat Efrem  ] attended a reception at the ambassador’s residence on February 2 . 
This was the first Post invitation General [PER Sebhat  ] has accepted for almost two years . 
He and the ambassador discussed past military to military exchanges , training , and education . 
General [PER Sebhat  ] fondly remembers GIs from [ORG Kagnew Station  ] who helped tutor his math and science classes as a young student ; he said he hoped circumstances would permit a resumption of mil-mil relations . 
February 2 is also President [PER Isaias’ birthday  ] , yet General [PER Sebhat  ] chose to spend the evening celebrating [MISC Groundhog Day  ] at the [LOC CMR.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) TOUGH TALK ON SUPPORTING TERRORISM ----------------------------------------- Despite the clear signals by party and government officials of their interest in exploring a less antagonistic bilateral relationship , the ambassador on three occasions in recent weeks has delivered a very straightforward and simple message: [MISC Eritrean  ] support for [MISC Somali  ] extremists obviates closer ties and [LOC Eritrea  ] will be held accountable for any al-Shabaab attack on the [LOC United States  ] . 
The ambassador shared unclassified information with key [MISC Eritrean  ] authorities ( including the detailed NPR report of January 28 on al-Shabaab’s recruitment and training of [MISC Minnesotans  ] ) to reinforce the seriousness and urgency of the al-Shabaab threat . 
One senior official acknowledged limited [MISC Eritrean  ] contact with al-Shabaab , but claimed the contact was “infrequent and indirect.” He added , “If there was anything we could do to prevent a terrorist attack on the [LOC United States  ] , we will do it.” The ambassador warned that [LOC Eritrea  ] was in a very perilous situation , as its support for al-Shabaab makes [LOC Eritrea  ] at least partially responsible for al-Shabaab’s actions , yet [LOC Eritrea  ] does not control it. “Based on recent history , how do you think we would react to a major al-Shabaab terrorist attack against the [LOC United States  ] ? ” the ambassador asked . 
This seems to have driven home the point to our [MISC Eritrean  ] interlocutors. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) COMMENT -------------- Eritrea’s fundamental interest in re-engaging with the [LOC United States  ] is to promote a “balanced” [LOC U.S.  ] approach to its border dispute with [LOC Ethiopia  ] . 
[PER Isaias  ] views everything through this lens . 
While we have delivered an unambiguously stark message on counterterrorism , we are uncertain how this will factor into [PER Isaias’  ] opaque calculations . 
Among [MISC Eritrean  ] and foreign observers , there is a growing consensus that [PER Isaias  ] is increasingly isolating himself and marginalizing all organs of government and the party . 
Can he and will he make a rational cost-benefit analysis on continued support for [MISC Somali  ] extremists ? 
[PER Isaias  ] might listen to the rulers of [LOC Libya  ] and [LOC Qatar  ] ; we leave it to others to judge whether those messages would necessarily be helpful . 
Unlike the party , exiled opposition , or general [MISC Eritrean  ] populace , the military’s officer corps has the wherewithal to precipitate a sudden change . 
We have seen no serious cracks in its loyalty , as the perceived external threat from [LOC Ethiopia  ] trumps all else , but we will step up our efforts to cultivate cordial relations with key military leaders as circumstances permit . 
End Comment .
