On [LOC Iraq  ] , [ORG MGM  ] said that [LOC France  ] wanted to see [LOC Iraq  ] serve once again as a buffer against [MISC Iranian  ] expansionism , but doubted that the [LOC West  ] had sufficient resources to end [MISC Iranian  ] influence in [LOC Iraq  ] while simultaneously solving the country 's economic problems . 
On [LOC Afghanistan  ] , he reviewed the achievements of the [ORG Riga Conference  ] with satisfaction but said no [MISC European  ] country was prepared to send additional troops at this time .

[ORG Lebanon: Putting the Tribunal  ] on Ice ------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The Ambassador hosted [MISC French  ] NSA-equivalent [PER Maurice Gourdault-Montagne  ] ( [ORG MGM  ] ) for breakfast on January 22 . 
[ORG MGM  ] cheerfully reviewed preparations for the January 25 [ORG Lebanon Conference  ] , saying [LOC France  ] would announce a contribution of 500 million euros , while [LOC Germany  ] would pledge somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 million euros . 
He observed with pleasure that [MISC British  ] FM [PER Beckett  ] was now planning to attend ( a reversal he gratefully attributed to [LOC U.S.  ] encouragement ) . 
The only disappointment , he said , was [LOC Russia  ] , which would be represented by Special Middle East Envoy Saltanov , even though FM [PER Lavrov  ] 's schedule could have permitted him to attend at least the opening session. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG MGM  ] said he saw little chance of resolving [LOC Lebanon  ] 's domestic political crisis prior to the [MISC Lebanese  ] presidential election in November 2007 . 
Consequently , some had raised the idea of " putting the tribunal in the freezer " until that time , in hopes that a delay in setting up the tribunal would aid PM [PER Siniora  ] to break the political deadlock . 
" Of course , we ( neither he nor [PER Chirac  ] ) are not advocating this idea , " [ORG MGM  ] stressed at several points . 
Nevertheless , he continued , the [MISC Lebanese  ] themselves might ask the [MISC French  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] to put the tribunal on ice , in part because [PER Siniora  ] would need the opposition 's help in order to deliver the economic reforms that the GOL is promising at this week 's conference . 
The only other option , [ORG MGM  ] continued , would be to change the scope of the tribunal itself -- something [LOC France  ] found unacceptable . 
When pressed on why the [MISC French  ] were contemplating a change in their approach to the tribunal at this point -- especially when it was unclear that [LOC Lebanon  ] 's opposition had the upper hand -- [ORG MGM  ] made another ( and somewhat jumbled ) reference to the need to obtain the opposition 's support for economic reform . 
[PER Chirac  ] 's [LOC Iran  ] Envoy: Is the [ORG Idea Dead  ] or Not ? --------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Turning to recent media reports concerning President [PER Chirac  ] 's plans to send a high level envoy to [LOC Iran  ] , [ORG MGM  ] said he was strongly reminded of how a few years ago internal USG discussion of possible changes in [LOC Iran  ] policy had been leaked to the [LOC Wall Street Journal  ] , thereby killing the proposed discussion before it had a chance to take place . 
He said [PER Chirac  ] 's envoy proposal had suffered much the same fate after those opposed to any change in the [MISC French  ] approach to [LOC Iran  ] ( [ORG MGM  ] did not speculate on who they might be ) leaked the content of sensitive MFA-Elysee discussions to [ORG Le Monde  ] . 
( Although [ORG Le Monde  ] approached him for comment before running with the piece , [ORG MGM  ] said the journalist already had " the whole story . 
" ) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG MGM  ] acknowledged that the [MISC Elysee  ] had two concerns about sending an envoy to [LOC Tehran  ] . 
First , one could argue ( and [MISC Saudi  ] King [PER Abdallah  ] did , in the strongest terms ) that sending an envoy to engage the [MISC Iranians  ] on [LOC Lebanon  ] would merely consecrate [LOC Iran  ] 's role in [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
( The [LOC PARIS  ] 00000257 002 OF 003 counterargument , [ORG MGM  ] said , was that [LOC Iran  ] 's influence is a fact , like it or not . 
) The second concern was that the [MISC Iranians  ] might try to parley the overture into an invitation to attend the January 25 [ORG Lebanon Conference  ] . 
" But even if they had asked , we weren't going to invite them , " [ORG MGM  ] assured the Ambassador. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) As for the virtues of engaging with [LOC Tehran  ] , [ORG MGM  ] argued that it would be useful to dispel [MISC Iranian  ] misperceptions of [LOC France  ] 's policy aims in the [LOC Middle East  ] without engaging in a debate on those aims . 
Hence , [PER Chirac  ] had mulled the possibility of arming his envoy with a letter to Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] , which would spell out [LOC France  ] 's position on [LOC Israel  ] ( i.e. , that it has a right to exist ) , on [ORG UNSCR  ] 1701 ( that all states are obligated to work toward its full implementation ) , and on [LOC Iran  ] 's need to promote regional stability ( code for stop interfering in [LOC Iraq  ] ) . 
In addition , [PER Chirac  ] and his advisors reasoned that an envoy 's visit might strengthen the hand of President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's critics. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG MGM  ] stressed that the idea of sending Foreign Minister [ORG Douste-Blazy  ] was no longer an option , not only because of the [ORG Le Monde  ] leak but also because of vehement opposition from [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] and [LOC Egypt  ] . 
[ORG MGM  ] also made it clear that he himself would not be an envoy to [LOC Tehran  ] , given the likelihood that the [MISC Iranians  ] would try to oblige him to see President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] ( which neither [PER Chirac  ] nor his advisers will do , given [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's public declarations on [LOC Israel  ] ) . 
However , [ORG MGM  ] did not categorically exclude the possibility that [PER Chirac  ] would not send someone else ( e.g. , [PER Jean-Claude Cousseran  ] ) as an envoy . 
[ORG UNIFIL: A Solution  ] on Drones ? ----------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG MGM  ] indicated that [LOC France  ] was searching for a solution to the problem of operating UAVs ( i.e. , " drones " ) over southern [LOC Lebanon  ] in the wake of recent statements by [ORG Hizballah  ] claiming that [LOC France  ] would share with [LOC Israel  ] any intelligence collected by the drones . 
[ORG MGM  ] said [LOC France  ] would not allow [ORG Hizballah  ] to draw red-lines impinging upon the operations of [MISC French  ] peacekeepers ; [ORG Hizballah  ] had attempted this once before with respect to the deployment of Leclerc tanks , and the [MISC French  ] had deployed the tanks anyway . 
However , he confirmed a difference of opinion between the Ministries of [MISC Defense  ] and Foreign Affairs: the military was determined to operate the drones ( which were shipped to [ORG UNIFIL  ] at the request of [ORG UNDPKO  ] ) , whereas the diplomats advised caution . 
Consequently , [ORG MGM  ] said the [MISC French  ] were leaning towards a " demonstration flight " held in the presence of members of the [ORG Lebanese Armed Forces  ] with " maximum transparency " so that it would be clear to the [MISC Lebanese  ] public that the UAV flights would not be used as a source of intelligence for [LOC Israel  ] . 
The final decision , he emphasized , would only be made by [PER Chirac  ] himself. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Noting that on the ground cooperation between [MISC Lebanese  ] civilians living in [ORG UNIFIL  ] 's area of operations and [MISC French  ] peacekeepers ended overnight following FM [ORG Douste-Blazy  ] 's ill-considered declaration that [ORG Hizballah  ] was an enemy to [LOC France  ] , [ORG MGM  ] said [LOC France  ] " must walk a fine line " while not allowing [ORG Hizballah  ] to dictate terms to [ORG UNIFIL  ] . 
If necessary , [LOC France  ] could reinforce its military presence by deploying the second of two battalions pledged to [ORG UNIFIL  ] last year . 
[ORG MGM  ] confirmed that in February , the [MISC French  ] would conduct a 6-month review of their participation in [ORG UNIFIL  ] . 
While he foresaw no change in [LOC France  ] 's participation as a result of this review , he conceded that any attack against [MISC French  ] peacekeepers would likely lead to further evaluation of [LOC France  ] 's role . 
Moreover , he admitted that the [MISC French  ] are deeply concerned that [ORG Hizballah  ] might attempt to kidnap [MISC French  ] peacekeepers in the run-up to the [MISC French  ] presidential elections this Spring . 
[LOC Syria  ] ----- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Noting ruefully that a velvet revolution does not appear to be in prospect any time soon in [LOC Damascus  ] , [ORG MGM  ] expressed mild concern over the future of [LOC France  ] 's [LOC Syria  ] policy once [PER Chirac  ] leaves office . 
" Any new government will be tempted to think that talking to the [MISC Syrians  ] is the answer , " he said , adding that while [ORG Socialist Party  ] candidate [PER Segolene Royal  ] had indicated her agreement with the general thrust of current [MISC French  ] policy , Interior Minister [PER Sarkozy  ] remained somewhat vague on the issue . 
[ORG MGM  ] noted that FM Muallim has summoned the [MISC French  ] ambassador in [LOC Damascus  ] to a [LOC PARIS  ] 00000257 003 OF 003 meeting on January 25 , in what the [MISC French  ] were regarding as a sign of [MISC Syrian  ] anxiety about the success of the [ORG International Conference  ] for [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] ----------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG MGM  ] expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the [LOC NATO Summit  ] in [LOC Riga  ] , and , looking ahead to the informal ministerial on January 26 , he emphasized that no [ORG EU  ] country was prepared to send additional troops to [LOC Afghanistan  ] at this time . 
However , he said there was a willingness to undertake further consultation on how to combine civil/military objectives in [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( e.g. , counternarcotics ) . 
While offering a justification for [LOC France  ] 's proposed contact group , [ORG MGM  ] did no press the point .
