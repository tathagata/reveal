END SUMMARY . 
DIALOGUE PROCESS - BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER ------------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Two years after the shocking murder of [MISC Dutch  ] filmmaker [PER Theo van Gogh  ] by a [PER Dutch-born Islamist  ] , the [MISC Dutch  ] remain focused on defusing social tensions associated with the country 's [MISC Muslims  ] . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] continue to grapple with integration challenges and in response the [ORG Embassy  ] hosted a conference entitled Sharing Ideas Building Bridges: a [MISC Dutch-U.S  ] . 
[ORG Muslim Dialogue  ] on November 1-2 . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] convened the initiative with the [ORG Leadership Conference  ] on [ORG Civil Rights Education Fund  ] ( [ORG LCCREF  ] ) , a [LOC Washington  ] [LOC D.C.  ] based non-profit organization working as an umbrella for 180 national organizations on diversity , social integration , and civil rights. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) Seventy-two [MISC Dutch  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Muslims  ] , drawn from a broad cross-section of society met as Dialogue Participants . 
Many , including [PER Shaykh Muhammed Hishan Kabbani  ] , Chairman of the [ORG Islamic Supreme Council  ] of [LOC America  ] , praised the [ORG Embassy  ] for bringing together [MISC Muslims  ] of such different ethnic backgrounds . 
Participants attended dialogue sessions moderated by professional facilitators on such topics as identity , civic participation , media , youth , women 's issues and economic opportunity. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Action plans presented by each group during the closing plenary included: combating high school drop-out rates and unemployment within minority groups ; providing media training to promote a diversity of [MISC Muslim  ] voices , promoting role models among [MISC Moroccan  ] youth ; educating [MISC Muslims  ] and the general public about the [MISC Muslim  ] immigrant experience and heritage ; and narrowing the generation gap within [MISC Muslim  ] immigrant communities by building stronger social networks across age demographics and experience. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) Some 48 Dialogue Partners met in parallel sessions . 
[MISC American  ] partners included: [PER Matt Bryza  ] , [MISC European  ] Deputy Assistant Secretary ( DOS ) ; [PER Farah Pandith  ] , Director for [LOC Middle East Regional Initiatives  ] ( [ORG NSC  ] ) ; [PER Wade Henderson  ] , President of the [ORG Leadership Conference  ] on [ORG Civil Rights  ] ; . 
Presenting [MISC Dutch  ] Partners included: [PER Maria van der Hoeven  ] , Minister of Education ; [PER Ahmed Aboutaleb  ] , [LOC Amsterdam  ] Deputy Mayor ; [PER Paul Scheffer  ] , Professor of [ORG Urban Studies  ] at [ORG Amsterdam University  ] and an authority on multi-cultural society ; and [PER Jo Ritzen  ] , former Minister of Education and current President of [ORG Maastricht University.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) These Dialogue Partners were then invited to join the [MISC Muslim  ] Participants during a final plenary session to provide feedback and comments on the action plans presented . 
Partners were also encouraged to connect with the Participants during a final lunch , evening reception , and closing dinner . 
DIALOGUE LAYS GROUNDWORK FOR FURTHER ENGAGEMENT --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) The Dialogue successfully met its goals of building bridges among and between [MISC American  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] [MISC Muslims  ] . 
Many THE HAGUE 00002515 002.2 OF 002 spoke openly of the need for stronger contact networks through which mainstream [MISC Muslims  ] can communicate and organize . 
Others were excited to learn of new activists and organizations in the [LOC U.S.  ] working on these issues . 
Vowing to continue the momentum begun at the conference , some [MISC Americans  ] initiated a new network of [MISC Muslims  ] in the [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC D.C.  ] , area and pledged to meet regularly. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) In addition to the action plans , a handful of initiatives arose organically during the dialogue as connections were made and ideas were shared . 
For example , a group of [MISC Dutch Moroccan  ] business executives -- many meeting each other for the first time -- discussed practical solutions to increasing [MISC Moroccan  ] representation in [MISC Dutch  ] businesses . 
Another [MISC Dutch  ] Participant described during the closing plenary how fellow participants were the missing link , helping him get funding for an upcoming job fair for minority students. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) In a spontaneous and motivating closing speech , [PER Ahmed Aboutaleb  ] , a well regarded [MISC Dutch  ] [MISC Muslim  ] politican , congratulated the event and reiterated the importance of building trust within our societies . 
Ambassador [PER Arnall  ] 's warmly received remarks reiterated the importance of vision and encouraged all present to continue the dialogue begun during the conference . 
Many expressed gratitude to the Ambassador , [PER Mrs. Arnall  ] , and [ORG Embassy  ] for their graciousness as co-conveners of the conference . 
A desire for further dialogue was a common refrain , with some calling specifically for future dialogues to include representatives of [MISC Christian  ] , [MISC Hindu  ] , and [MISC Jewish  ] communities in both countries . 
COMMENT: FOCUS ON CITIZEN-TO-CITIZEN DIALOGUE --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Integration remains a sensitive topic in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
Our [MISC Dutch  ] contacts were initially skeptical about the [ORG Embassy  ] 's hosting of a [MISC Dutch-U.S  ] . 
[ORG Muslim Dialogue  ] , despite assurances from all levels , including the Ambassador , that the [ORG Embassy  ] was not seeking to lecture the [MISC Dutch  ] on integration matters . 
Press coverage was favorable however , with the leading [MISC Dutch  ] daily , [ORG De Telegraaf  ] , calling it a remarkable initiative. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) To ensure an honest and constructive dialogue , the [ORG Embassy  ] conscientiously protected Dialogue Participants' privacy . 
By design , government officials , including [ORG Embassy  ] staff , press , and [ORG Dialogue Partners  ] , did not take part in the dialogue sessions . 
This approach earned Participant trust , effectively disarming those who were more skeptical of the [ORG USG  ] 's motives for holding the conference. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Embassy  ] believes that the Dialogue 's most valuable contribution was to connect knowledgeable individuals ( i.e. role models ) with those actively seeking guidance . 
[ORG Embassy  ] strongly supports the grassroots efforts reflected in follow-on initiatives and action plans developed during the [ORG Dialogue  ] . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] will continue to provide speakers focusing on diversity and plans to continue the momentum begun at the Dialogue by convening an alumni event in the near future , perhaps in conjunction with the celebration of [PER Martin Luther King  ] 's birthday . 
These activities are consistent with Secretary [PER Rice  ] 's calls for increased engagement with [MISC Muslim  ] communities worldwide . 
Moreover , they further the broader goals of fostering a richer understanding of diversity within [MISC American  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] societies , including the need for greater social integration , religious pluralism , and equal opportunity in housing , education , and employment.</pre></code>
