A ) [ORG BAKU  ] 919 [PER B. B  ] ) [ORG BAKU  ] 897 [PER C. C  ] ) [ORG BAKU  ] 883 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Anne E. Derse  ] , Reasons 1.4 ( b , d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: [ORG BP Azerbaijan  ] President [PER Bill Schrader  ] told [ORG USG  ] interlocutors that there will be “plenty of gas” for [LOC Azerbaijan  ] to sell to [LOC Georgia  ] this winter . 
This is a result of oil production problems at the offshore ACG oil mega-field , which continues to cost the [ORG GOAJ  ] tens of millions of dollars in lost revenues , and the resulting technological prohibition on re-injecting the gas . 
[LOC Post-Georgia  ] conflict , the [ORG GOAJ  ] has shown renewed interest in the [ORG AIOC Consortium  ] developing the second largest known gas field in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] after [ORG Shah Deniz  ] , referred to as ACG “Deep Gas.” [ORG BP  ] has revised upwards its production estimate for [ORG Shah Deniz Phase Two  ] from 13 to 16 bcm/a - a development which , in conjunction with the extra one bcm/a that will be gained from debottlenecking [ORG Shah Deniz Phase One  ] , could help alleviate differences on supply volumes between [LOC Azerbaijan  ] and [LOC Turkey  ] . 
[ORG AIOC  ] partners have not yet been able to resolve [ORG Shah Deniz Phase  ] I pricing discrepancies with [LOC Turkey  ] ; the case could be headed to international arbitration . 
[ORG BP Azerbaijan  ] continues to maintain that [PER Nabucco  ] is “a good project , but ten years too early.” END SUMMARY <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On September 29 [ORG BP Azerbaijan  ] President [PER Bill Schrader  ] met with Ambassador [PER Derse  ] and UK Ambassador [PER Browne  ] , to brief them on ongoing production problems in [LOC ACG  ] offshore oil mega-field . 
On October 1 , [ORG BP President  ] [PER Bill Schrader  ] met with Deputy Secretary [PER Negroponte  ] , [PER DAS Bryza  ] and Ambassador [PER Derse  ] at [LOC Sangachal Terminal  ] , to brief them on BP’s [LOC Azerbaijan  ] operations . 
On October 2 , Ambassador [PER Derse  ] hosted a lunch in honor of the Deputy Secretary , at which [ORG BP Azerbaijan  ] President [PER Schrader  ] and other high-level [ORG BP Azerbaijan  ] executives briefed Secretary [PER Negroponte  ] , [PER DAS Bryza  ] and Ambassador [PER Derse  ] on regional gas development issues. ‘PLENTY OF GAS’ FOR [LOC GEORGIA  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Schrader  ] said that given BP’s ongoing oil production problems at the [ORG Central Azeri  ] platform ( refs [MISC A-C  ] ) , [ORG BP  ] would not technically be able to re-inject gas into this field “well into the winter.” As such the [ORG GOAJ  ] would have “plenty of gas” to sell to [LOC Georgia  ] this winter should it wish ( NOTE: according to the [ORG AIOC  ] PSA , all [ORG ACG  ] gas not used for operational reasons such as re-injection is to be given free to [ORG SOCAR  ] ) . 
[ORG BP  ] will provide to [ORG SOCAR  ] as much of this ACG associated gas as technically possible , since the alternative would be either to flare it or to decrease oil production even further . 
SD2 = 16 BCM/A <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Schrader  ] said that currently [ORG Shah Deniz  ] ( [ORG SD  ] ) production was doing quite well , with four wells operating and a fifth due to start in January 2009 . 
In a significant change , [ORG BP Azerbaijan  ] has revised upwards its own internal production estimates for [ORG Shah Deniz Phase Two  ] ( SD2 ) gas from 13 to 16 bcm/a , although it has not yet communicated this revised estimate to [ORG SOCAR  ] nor made this fact public , as the revised estimate had not yet been approved by [ORG BP  ] ( NOTE: [ORG BP Azerbaijan  ] President [PER Schrader  ] asked that [ORG USG  ] interlocutors keep this revised estimate to themselves and not share it with either [ORG SOCAR  ] or the GOT ) . 
SD2 Production would likely start in 2015 . 
[ORG GOAJ  ] INTERESTED IN ACG DEEP GAS <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Schrader  ] said that post-Georgia crisis , [ORG SOCAR  ] has clearly seen the benefits of its association with [ORG IOCs  ] and as such has sought to “fast-track” discussions with the [ORG AIOC Consortium  ] over developing the non-associated gas that lies underneath the [ORG ACG  ] oil field ( NOTE: referred to as “ACG [ORG Deep Gas  ] , ” this gas is not covered by the current PSA between the [ORG AIOC Consortium  ] and the [ORG GOAJ  ] . 
However , the [ORG Consortium  ] has the right of first refusal and the right to match any offer for [ORG ACG Deep Gas  ] development , and as a practical matter could prevent development of this field by any other [ORG IOC  ] ) . 
This field could produce one to three bcm/a by 2013/2014 , with a production plateau of six to ten bcm/a by 2015 , which could continue for 30 years . 
[ORG SOCAR  ] was seeking an [ORG MOU  ] on [ORG BAKU  ] 00000947 002 OF 003 developing this field with the [ORG AIOC Consortium  ] by the end of 2008 . 
( COMMENT: Take together , this additional production projections for [ORG Shah Deniz  ] and [ORG ACG Deep Gas  ] could have significant positive impact in satisfying Turkey’s demand and in advancing the [LOC Southern Corridor  ] in 2015-16 ) . 
[ORG ACG  ] AS SUBSTITUTE FOR SD2 ? <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
[PER Schrader  ] characterized [MISC Turkish  ] intransigence on [MISC SD2  ] gas transit as the major barrier to expeditious [MISC SD2  ] development . 
He said that should the GOT continue to refuse to provide transit for [MISC SD2  ] gas on terms that [LOC Azerbaijan  ] finds commercially viable , then the [ORG GOAJ  ] might well decide to keep [MISC SD2  ] undeveloped and “let [LOC Turkey  ] freeze for a few winters.” In the interim , the [ORG GOAJ  ] would proceed with developing [ORG ACG Deep Gas  ] , whose product volumes would be low enough to satisfy the regional market of [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC Georgia  ] and [LOC Iran  ] . 
( Note: in a separate conversation , Foreign Minister [PER Mammadyarov  ] reported to the Deputy Secretary that natural gas talks with [ORG Russa’s Gazprom  ] had “failed , ” because of differencesin opinion on formulas for “market pricing.” End Comment ) SD1 ARBITRATION <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Schrader  ] said that negotiations with [ORG Botas  ] for the post-April 1 , 2008 price of SD1 gas are still at a dead-end , with [ORG Botas  ] offering a price of [ORG USD  ] 150 per 1,000 tcm at a time when a “realistic” price for this gas would be closer to [ORG USD  ] 350/tcm . 
( Gazprom’s price for gas to [LOC Europe  ] is close to [ORG USD  ] 500/tcm . 
) As such , the [ORG Shah Deniz Consortium  ] partners will in all likelihood vote on October 15 to take the matter to arbitration . 
ACG OIL PRODUCTION PROBLEMS <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Schrader  ] said that the September 17th shutdown of the [LOC Central Azeri  ] ( [LOC CA  ] ) platform , in which the “red button” was pressed after detection of a gas leak on the [ORG Central Azeri Platform  ] that led to the evacuation of 211 platform workers off the platform , was the largest such emergency evacuation in BP’s history . 
Given the explosive potential , [ORG BP  ] was quite fortunate to have been able to evacuate everyone safely and to prevent any gas ignition . 
Gas bubbles on the water’s surface were no longer observed from the air by September 19th . 
Due to the blowout of a gas-injection well there was “a lot of mud” on the platform , which [ORG BP  ] would analyze to help find the cause of the blowout and gas leak . 
Gas samples would have to be taken to [LOC London  ] to determine whether the gas was shallow ( biogenic ) or deep ( foundation ) . 
[LOC Central  ] , [ORG Eastern  ] and [ORG Western Azeri  ] Azeri platforms remain shut down . 
9 . 
( C ) [PER Schrader  ] said that [ORG Western Azeri Platform  ] was shut down due to its only functioning generator being powered by a cable from the [ORG Central Azeri Platform  ] , and [ORG BP  ] hoped to be able to restart this platform in November. “Black-starting” a platform ( i.e. restarting a platform when all of its operations had been fully shut down ) was a very difficult , time-consuming process , and would have to be taken slowly , on a step-by-step basis . 
[ORG BP Azerbaijan  ] would slowly start to get its people back out on the [ORG CA Platform  ] later this week to begin re-starting selective systems that would help ascertain the problem’s source. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) It is possible that [ORG BP Azerbaijan  ] “would never know” the cause of the gas leak , but [ORG BP  ] is continuing to methodically investigate possible theories , [PER Schrader  ] said . 
Although the production decrease had not been a significant story heretofore , he thought it likely that more attention in the industry would be paid to it after October 2 , when [ORG SOCAR  ] nominated volumes to be sold at [LOC Ceyhan  ] for the coming month . 
[PER Schrader  ] said although the story hadn’t caught the press’s attention , it had the full focus of the [ORG GOAJ  ] , which was losing “40 to 50 million dollars” each day that the ACG production remained at 300,000 bpd vice its earlier daily production of approximately 900,000 bpd . 
[ORG SD2 GAS PIPELINE OPTIONS  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [ORG BP Azerbaijan Gas Marketing Manager  ] [PER Richard Ruddiman  ] said that both the TGI and TAP pipeline projects each needed approximately seven bcm/a of SD2 gas to get sanctioned . 
[PER Nabucco  ] , a ‘greenfield’ project with no current infrastructure and with its 30 bcm/a carrying capacity , would [ORG BAKU  ] 00000947 003 OF 003 need firm commitments of at least eight bcm/a and relatively firm commitments for a total of 18 bcm/a before construction could begin . 
Given supply constraints , both [PER Schrader  ] and [PER Ruddiman  ] said that [PER Nabucco  ] was “a good project , but ten years too early , ” and that it was unlikely that it could get sanctioned within the next ten years . 
They said that a more “gradual and capillary” approach to delivering [MISC Caspian  ] gas to [LOC Europe  ] , similar to how the [LOC US  ] gas infrastructure was developed , was a more realistic scenario for getting [MISC Caspian  ] gas to [LOC Europe  ] than mega-projects such as [PER Nabucco  ] . 
[PER Ruddiman  ] said that there was no hard “latest date , ” by which these projects had to be developed ; their sanctioning could continue to be postponed until/unless the main barrier of [MISC Turkish  ] transit was solved . 
The key requirement for sanctioning any of these pipelines was long-term gas supply contracts that could be used to achieve construction financing . 
[MISC WESTERN ROUTE  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Schrader  ] said the [ORG Western Route  ] oil pipeline through [LOC Georgia  ] to the [LOC Black Sea  ] ( [LOC Baku-Supsa  ] ) was ready to resume operations and would be doing so within a week or so . 
( NOTE: It had restarted operations a few days before Russia’s August incursions into [LOC Georgia  ] , after which [ORG BP  ] shut it down for operational security reasons ) . 
[ORG TURKMEN PETROCHEMICALS  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Schrader  ] and [PER Ruddiman  ] said that developing gas-intensive petrochemical industries in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] and [LOC Turkmenistan  ] probably doesn’t make sense , even given its large amounts of gas available for feedstock , as the distance to significant markets would put [LOC Turkmenistan  ] at a competitive disadvantage . 
[PER Ruddiman  ] pointed to the example of [LOC Sumgayit  ] in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] as an example of a petrochemical center disadvantaged by its relative distance from key regional markets. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) COMMENT: The silver lining to [MISC ACG’s  ] ongoing oil production problems is that it seems to have solved Georgia’s winter gas woes , given the massive amounts of [ORG ACG  ] gas that will not be needed in the foreseeable future for reinjection . 
Less adulterated good news is that SD2 volumes will be closer to 16 bcm/a , and another one bcm/a may be available from SD1 . 
When SD2 production was expected to be 13 bcm/a , [ORG SOCAR  ] saw approximately three bcm/a going to [LOC Georgia  ] and [LOC Azerbaijan  ] and seven needed to sanction a pipeline to [LOC Europe  ] , leaving four bcm/a for [LOC Turkey  ] . 
Given SOCAR’s previous offer to [LOC Turkey  ] of surplus ( i.e. above 13 bcm/a ) SD2 production , these new numbers mean that [ORG SOCAR  ] could potentially offer [LOC Turkey  ] seven bcm/a This is an amount very close to the eight bcm/a , on which [LOC Turkey  ] is insisting as the price of transit . 
Equally good news is the GOAJ’s newfound desire to expedite ACG Deep Gas development , although Embassy has heard from [ORG SOCAR  ] that this field’s development also depends on the GOT allowing transit of [MISC Caspian  ] gas to [MISC European  ] markets . 
END COMMENT. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 .
