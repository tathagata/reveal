Summary <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Dear Secretary Rice: I welcome you to [LOC Spain  ] on behalf of our 367 [MISC American  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] colleagues serving the [LOC United States  ] at [LOC Mission Spain  ] . 
Your visit is a milestone in our work , together with you , to overcome the differences over [LOC Iraq  ] with the [MISC Spanish  ] government and convince them that further strengthening cooperation coincides with [LOC Spain  ] , s national interest . 
At the same time , your visit can serve as a catalyst to encourage [LOC Spain  ] to become an even more active ) - but responsible -- member of a [MISC Transatlantic  ] partnership , marked by cooperative efforts on our shared values , including counter-terrorism and promoting democracy , freedom and human rights throughout the world . 
This means that you will need to speak frankly to the [MISC Spanish  ] government about [LOC Cuba  ] , despite their desire to avoid the issue . 
The issue need not be the central one in a rich agenda on a wide variety of fronts in which we work closely with [LOC Spain  ] ; however , [LOC Cuba  ] must be an element of your discussions on democracy , and [LOC Spain  ] , s own special responsibility as a democracy leader that has successfully undergone the transition from dictatorship to thriving democracy . 
Your discussions will also include [LOC Kosovo  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Spain  ] , s [ORG OSCE  ] Chairmanship , [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Latin America  ] and the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
[PER Moratinos  ] will raise a thorny child-custody case involving a [MISC Spanish  ] woman currently jailed for contempt of court in [LOC New Jersey  ] . 
Your interview with the [MISC Spanish  ] press will provide an opportunity to reach out to the [MISC Spanish  ] people and underscore the significant value of our alliance and convey our views on issues on which we differ . 
We see this visit as a great opportunity to advance our relations with [LOC Spain  ] , and the [MISC Spanish  ] government shares this view . 
END SUMMARY <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The [MISC Spanish  ] government has long awaited your first visit as Secretary of State and views it as a sign of the importance of strong [MISC U.S.-Spain  ] relations . 
They will use your visit to counter criticism that the [ORG Zapatero  ] government has shattered the transatlantic relationship . 
Per the [LOC Spain  ] strategy you approved two years ago , we have sought to move this government away from visceral and reflexive anti-U.S. policies and sentiments , carving out areas in which [ORG Zapatero  ] , s government can offer support for the President , s broad global agenda . 
We have made clear to the [ORG Zapatero  ] government that the price of our willingness to publicly promote good bilateral relations is real contributions on world issues . 
While we have made some positive headway , the [ORG Zapatero  ] government has not hesitated on occasion to pursue an agenda counter to our own when deemed in the Socialist party , s domestic political interest . 
Your visit should encourage [LOC Spain  ] to be an even more active member of a transatlantic partnership that works cooperatively in pursuit of shared values on freedom , democracy , human rights and development . 
What is Working <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) On the positive side over the past two years , [LOC Spain  ] contributed $22 million to the [MISC Basrah Children  ] , s Hospital and offered a further $28 million in new money at the recent [LOC Iraq  ] Compact meeting . 
The [ORG Zapatero  ] government established a robust presence in [LOC Afghanistan  ] that includes allowing the [MISC Spanish  ] military to lead a [ORG PRT  ] and co-lead a [ORG Forward Support Base  ] in [LOC Western Afghanistan  ] . 
[LOC Spain  ] has contributed some 150 million [MISC Euros  ] in [MISC Afghan  ] reconstruction funds . 
[LOC Spain  ] also has 1100 troops deployed along the [MISC Lebanon-Syria-Israel  ] border as part of [ORG UNIFIL  ] . 
The government allowed a sale of military aircraft to [LOC Venezuela  ] to die . 
They support [LOC Turkey  ] , s membership in the [ORG EU  ] and have said that they will not pose problems on [LOC Missile Defense  ] . 
We have superb two-way cooperation on counter-terrorism , counternarcotics , non-proliferation and military issues . 
This includes the use of two vital bases in southern [LOC Spain  ] near the Straits of [LOC Gibraltar  ] , where we maintain over 2000 personnel that serve as major logistical hubs for the flow of troops and materiel into the [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] theaters . 
The [ORG GOS  ] also very much appreciates [LOC US  ] coordination with [LOC Spain  ] on [LOC Western Sahara  ] , since [LOC Spain  ] sees near-by [LOC North Africa  ] as vital to its national security interests. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In addition , our economic relationship with [LOC Spain  ] is strong and mutually beneficial . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] economy has boomed in the last decade as a result of structural reforms , [ORG EU  ] aid , and membership in the [LOC Euro  ] zone . 
The commercial relationship is dominated by a very strong [LOC U.S.  ] direct investment presence , although two-way trade remains a relatively minor percentage of each country , s exports and imports . 
Many of the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Fortune 100  ] firms are present and [ORG MADRID  ] 00001021 002 OF 005 doing well . 
The [MISC American  ] Chamber of [LOC Commerce  ] estimates that about five percent of [LOC Spain  ] , s annual GDP comes from [LOC U.S.  ] investment . 
In recent years , [LOC U.S.  ] portfolio investors have bought significant shares in major [MISC Spanish  ] firms . 
[MISC Spanish  ] firms have rediscovered [LOC America  ] and are now investing in the [LOC United States  ] , especially in the banking and renewable energy sectors , and [MISC Spanish  ] construction companies have also won important contracts in the [LOC U.S.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [LOC Spain  ] cooperates closely with the [LOC United States  ] in the fight against terrorism finance , co-chairing the [ORG Financial Action Task Force  ] with us . 
Following intensive intervention by the [ORG USG  ] and private industry , the [MISC Spanish  ] government is giving increased attention to intellectual property rights issues . 
Other areas where we work closely with the [MISC Spanish  ] include [ORG NASA  ] , s [ORG Deep Space Network  ] , and close partnerships in port security programs such as Megaports and the [ORG Container Security Initiative  ] . 
What Still Needs Work <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) However , our challenge has been to channel the efforts of a unpredictable [MISC Spanish  ] Foreign Minister who portrays himself as a self-styled &bridge8 between the [LOC U.S.  ] and difficult world players--such as [LOC Syria  ] , [LOC Cuba  ] , [LOC Iran  ] and some [MISC Palestinian  ] elements . 
Additionally , President [ORG Zapatero  ] plays to a largely leftist , pacifist support base , and uses foreign policy to win domestic political points rather than giving attention to core foreign policy priorities or embracing broader strategic goals. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) This has lent an erratic &zig-zag8 quality to the bilateral relationship . 
[PER Moratinos  ] , recent visit to [LOC Cuba  ] highlighted the difficulty of maintaining a smooth and stable pattern as did his earlier outreach to [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Iran  ] . 
[ORG Zapatero  ] , s reversal of his Defense Minister , s commitment to deploy 150 troops to staff the ISAF XI headquarters reflects [LOC PSOE  ] , s increasing sensitivity to [MISC Spanish  ] public concerns about growing dangers in [LOC Afghanistan  ] during this highly charged political season here ) with local/regional elections May 27 and national elections by March 2008 . 
[LOC Kosovo  ] independence is a sensitive issue for the [ORG GOS  ] , which maintains troops in [LOC KFOR  ] , because of concern about the impact of such an evolution on [LOC Spain  ] , s own complex federal vs. regional struggle . 
For this reason , a [ORG UNSC Resolution  ] explicitly authorizing independence will be essential for [LOC Spain  ] to maintain its troops there . 
Proposed policy agenda <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) We want to challenge the [ORG Zapatero  ] government to do better in the [MISC U.S.-Spain  ] relationship as a result of your visit . 
In your meetings with King [PER Juan Carlos  ] , [ORG Zapatero  ] and [PER Moratinos  ] , we suggest you frame our goals with [LOC Spain  ] over the following months along several interrelated themes that make clear the need to act responsibly in [ORG NATO  ] , [LOC Latin America  ] and the [LOC Middle East  ] in order to be seen as a reliable partner . 
We suggest the following themes: --Spain should work more closely in coordination with us in [LOC Europe  ] and around the world on the freedom or democracy agenda . 
[LOC Spain  ] has achieved a remarkable transformation since the end of dictatorship 30 years ago . 
It is one of the leading democracies in [LOC Europe  ] and has the 8th largest economy in the world . 
[LOC Spain  ] is now an active player in [LOC Europe  ] , [LOC Latin America  ] and the [LOC Middle East  ] , including [LOC Iran  ] . 
But [LOC Spain  ] needs to act in concert with the [ORG EU  ] , [ORG NATO  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] on key issues . 
There is too much at stake for [MISC Spanish  ] freelancing , as in the [LOC Middle East  ] , [LOC Cuba  ] and [LOC Russia  ] . 
The transatlantic community needs [LOC Spain  ] , s support on [LOC Kosovo  ] , [LOC Missile Defense  ] , [ORG NATO  ] transformation , and [LOC Iran  ] . 
The price of leadership and respect , which [LOC Spain  ] seems to desire , is the willingness to devote the resources , assume responsibility , share burdens and act jointly with other powers . 
We welcome [LOC Spain  ] , s commitment to stay the course in the pivotal struggle in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
We know it is a delicate political issue in this electoral season but it is the right thing to do and a responsible policy . 
[LOC Spain  ] , s [ORG OSCE  ] chairmanship is important on all of these issues and we want to ensure close consultations so that [MISC Russian  ] attempts to weaken key [ORG OSCE  ] functions are curtailed. --Spain needs to help in countering anti-Americanism by publicly emphasizing cooperation . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Spain  ] cooperate on a myriad of issues that matter to the [MISC Spanish  ] people , including the fight against terrorism and international organized crime , [LOC Middle East  ] , [LOC North Africa  ] , human rights and support for democracy . 
We urge the [MISC Spanish  ] government to work with us to allay anti-American sentiments [ORG MADRID  ] 00001021 003 OF 005 in [LOC Spain  ] , not just cooperate with us behind the scenes . 
[LOC Spain  ] , s changing population and proximity to [LOC North Africa  ] make it a prime target of [MISC Islamic  ] extremism regardless of its relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] It is essential that we emphasize our shared values of democracy , human rights , freedom and opportunity for immigrants . 
Furthermore , during this difficult election period , we do not want our bilateral relations to become a casualty of the political crossfire . 
We understand electoral politics , but not at our expense. --Spain should capitalize on its role as a democratic leader . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] welcomes [LOC Spain  ] , s contributions on [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] , defense ties and counter-terrorism ; these form the basis of our good bilateral relations . 
[LOC Spain  ] , s success in the transition from dictatorship to thriving democracy makes it a worldwide leader in the areas of democracy-building and institution-building . 
[LOC Spain  ] should deploy that expertise more actively in concert with our shared goals . 
Our respect for [LOC Spain  ] , s exemplary democratic transition makes it all the more perplexing and disconcerting that [LOC Spain  ] has embarked upon a policy of outreach to the [PER Raul Castro  ] regime , validating his succession with no clear message about the need for democratic transition . 
Nevertheless , we want to continue working with [LOC Spain  ] in support of human rights and market-based economic policies in [LOC Latin America  ] , including [LOC Cuba  ] , and we urge [LOC Spain  ] , s leadership to act in more positive ways and to demonstrate publicly [LOC Spain  ] , s own values. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) We believe that folding our concerns about recent [MISC Spanish  ] foreign policy moves into a broader , positive agenda can help advance our goals as we navigate the waters of a very difficult and volatile political season in [LOC Spain  ] . 
The [ORG Political Environment  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) You arrive just after the May 27 regional and local elections . 
Current polls show that the results will likely provide momentum for both [PER Zapatero  ] , s [ORG Socialist Party  ] and [PER Mariano Rajoy  ] , s [ORG Popular Party  ] going into national elections by March 2008 . 
In the regional elections , the [MISC Socialists  ] could gain seats and join in coalition governments in three current [ORG PP  ] regions . 
With Socialist victories in several regions last year , [PER Zapatero  ] could have a strong base of support going into the national elections . 
However , the [ORG PP  ] is expected to strengthen its support in its traditional regional strongholds . 
On the national level , while support for [PER Zapatero  ] has diminished since its peak after the March 2004 elections , [PER Rajoy  ] has not been able to capitalize and his ratings remain low and are falling . 
Assessment of [PER Zapatero  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Though polls show [PER Zapatero  ] , s support down from the high just following the March 2004 elections and considerable concern about his [ORG ETA  ] policies , he stands a good chance of surviving national elections in early 2008 , albeit with some of his support drifting to smaller , leftist parties in the [LOC Parliament.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Zapatero  ] focuses almost exclusively on domestic policy ; his foreign policy instincts are governed by the exigencies of their domestic political impact . 
With a largely left of center , pacifist public which is strongly opposed to the [LOC Iraq  ] war , the [ORG Aznar  ] government and [ORG Bush Administration  ] policies , [PER Zapatero  ] loses nothing by taking the [LOC U.S.  ] to task on key issues . 
However , [PER Zapatero  ] now recognizes that the [MISC Spanish  ] public believes that [LOC Spain  ] , s leaders must maintain good relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] After his first volatile year in office , he has sought to improve the tenor and substance of [MISC U.S.-Spain  ] relations while still maintaining the politically acceptable policy of offering criticism of [LOC U.S.  ] policies as part of the role of what he calls a &loyal ally.8 We suggest you encourage [PER Zapatero  ] to continue to view a positive agenda with the [LOC U.S.  ] as a necessary element of his political strategy and emphasize that the [LOC U.S.  ] will not keep silent when his government pursues policies that run counter to our shared values and interests . 
[PER Rajoy  ] as [ORG PP  ] leader <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Your meeting with [ORG PP  ] leader [PER Mariano Rajoy  ] will be interpreted in [LOC Spain  ] as a symbol of continued [LOC U.S.  ] ties with a partner that supports [LOC U.S.  ] foreign policy goals . 
However , we need to make clear to [PER Rajoy  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] will continue to work with the current government as long as it is in power because of our major long-term interests in [LOC Spain  ] , including in the war on terrorism and in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] media will scrutinize the length of your meeting with [PER Rajoy  ] in comparison with your session with [PER Zapatero  ] for signs of [LOC MADRID  ] 00001021 004 OF 005 any political signals we are trying to send. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Recent polls indicate that [PER Rajoy  ] thus far has not been able to galvanize support for his candidacy for [LOC Spain  ] , s Presidency , despite some very meaty issues that could be developed to the [ORG PP  ] , s advantage . 
One of the most crucial of these controversial issues is [PER Zapatero  ] , s policy toward the [MISC Basque  ] terrorist group [ORG ETA  ] , which the [ORG PP  ] viscerally opposes and which has driven hundreds of thousands of protesters into the streets . 
The [ORG PP  ] points to the December 30 attack at the [LOC Madrid  ] airport which killed two [MISC Ecuadorian  ] citizens as proof that [ORG ETA  ] will not renounce violence . 
The [ORG PP  ] remains strong in its traditional strongholds , however , and the [ORG ETA  ] issue has become increasingly worrisome to a number of [MISC Spaniards  ] . 
However , recent polls show that [PER Rajoy  ] himself has not galvanized support for his candidacy for [LOC Spain  ] , s Presidency . 
If [ORG PP  ] turns out a large number of voters for the regional and local elections , [PER Rajoy  ] nonetheless will come to your meeting buoyed with the hope of a strong challenge to [PER Zapatero  ] in the national elections . 
Bitterness over the March 11 terrorist attacks and the [ORG Aznar  ] government , s handling of the issue , however , remains a liability for [PER Rajoy  ] , and [MISC Spanish  ] politics at the national level are bitter and divided . 
Role of the King <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Your meeting with King [PER Juan Carlos  ] will demonstrate [LOC U.S.  ] respect for the [MISC Spanish  ] state and its people . 
Though prohibited from playing a direct role in foreign policy , [PER Juan Carlos  ] has helped behind the scenes . 
For example , he helped smooth relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] after tensions in the months following the 2004 [MISC Spanish  ] elections . 
In November of that year , President and [PER Mrs. Bush  ] invited the King and Queen for a pre-Thanksgiving lunch at [LOC Crawford  ] , which was widely interpreted here as a sign of respect for the [MISC Spanish  ] state . 
[PER Juan Carlos  ] is well versed on foreign policy issues and will welcome your review of the key issues you plan to discuss with [PER Zapatero  ] and [PER Moratinos  ] . 
He should also hear our strong concerns on issues like [LOC Cuba  ] and [LOC Syria  ] . 
On a personal note , you might congratulate the King on the birth of Crown [PER Prince Felipe  ] , s second daughter , [LOC Sofia  ] , born on April 29 , 2007 . 
Dealing with [PER Moratinos  ] <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) We no longer hear last year , s rumors of [PER Moratinos  ] , imminent departure from his post as Foreign Minister and he seems entrenched in his position . 
He seeks a role on the world stage andtries to capitalize on his old ties in the [LOC Middle East  ] , as well as [LOC Spain  ] , s presence in [LOC Lebanon  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] , to play a role on [MISC Israel-Palestinian  ] issues , [LOC Lebanon  ] , [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Iran  ] . 
We have sought to find ways to keep [PER Moratinos  ] in contact with senior [ORG USG  ] officials on a range of issues as a means to help channel his efforts . 
[LOC Spain  ] , s chairmanship of the [ORG OSCE  ] puts [PER Moratinos  ] in the unusual position of having a voice and interest in core transatlantic issues related to [ORG Central  ] and [ORG Eastern Europe  ] , [LOC Russia  ] and the [MISC Caucasus  ] . 
[PER Moratinos  ] , penchant for trying to &mediate8 needs to be tamed as [LOC Russia  ] issues come to the fore ; we have already seen evidence of [LOC Spain  ] , s willingness to try to excuse or mitigate [LOC Russia  ] , s recent threats to cut off [ORG CFE  ] . 
[PER Moratinos  ] has denied that his comments that he supports [MISC Missile Defense  ] discussion in the [ORG OSCE  ] , but [MISC Russian  ] Embassy contacts have told us that [PER Moratinos  ] supports the idea. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [ORG Moratinos'  ] recent trip to [LOC Cuba  ] is one of the most prominent of [PER Moratinos  ] , miscalculations with the [LOC U.S.  ] In addition to private protestations , I published an op-ed in [LOC Spain  ] , s leftist daily newspaper [ORG El Pais  ] , laying out [LOC U.S.  ] goals for democracy in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
He has pushed the [ORG Human Rights  ] dialogue promised during his visit so that it could take place just before your visit to [LOC Madrid  ] . 
[PER Moratinos  ] will argue this justifies his [LOC Cuba  ] policy . 
However , your visit should make clear to [PER Moratinos  ] the harm his trip has done to this effort , an objective he and [PER Zapatero  ] continually claim they share with us . 
[PER Moratinos  ] wants your brief bilateral before the working luncheon to be kept to a small group , where he wants to corral the issues of [LOC Cuba  ] , [LOC Kosovo  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( his proposal for an international neighbors conference ) . 
These are the three issues he deems most sensitive from the [MISC Spanish  ] side . 
In your working luncheon , issues will including [MISC US-Spain  ] bilateral relations ( including excellent counter-terrorism , defense , non-proliferation cooperation ) ; Transatlantic issues , including [LOC Spain  ] , s Chairmanship of the [ORG OSCE  ] , [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC Moscow  ] , s proposals for [ORG OSCE  ] to discuss [MISC Missile Defense  ] , to [LOC Russia  ] ( [MISC Missile Defense  ] ) ; and finally , [LOC Latin America  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Lebanon  ] and the [LOC Middle East  ] peace process . 
[LOC Iran  ] will be in the [MISC Spanish  ] news during your visit ; while you are here , [PER Larijani  ] may be meeting with [PER Solana  ] at a [LOC MADRID  ] 00001021 005 OF 005 location organized by the [MISC Spanish  ] . 
[PER Moratinos  ] will also want to discuss the way forward on [LOC Western Sahara  ] , and he is pleased at our cooperation in security the latest MINURSO resolution calling for direct talks between [LOC Morocco  ] and the [ORG Polisario.  ] <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) Two important bilateral issues fall in the judicial area . 
[PER Moratinos  ] has said he will raise with you the child custody involving [MISC Spanish  ] citizen [PER Maria Jos Carrascosa  ] who is currently jailed for contempt of court in [LOC Bergen County  ] , [LOC New Jersey  ] for failure to return her child to the [LOC US  ] as required by a [LOC New Jersey  ] court decision . 
During this political season in [LOC Madrid  ] , the case has become a cause celebre , with pictures of [PER Carrascosa  ] ) viewed as a mother separated from her child - in handcuffs entering the [LOC New Jersey  ] prison . 
The [ORG GOS  ] agrees that this is a case for the courts and both governments agree that mediation of the dispute is the appropriate response . 
However , [PER Moratinos  ] for political reasons has to show the government is doing something about the case . 
On our side , you should note continued [ORG USG  ] concern about the court case against the three [LOC US  ] servicemen charged with alleged &war crimes8 in the case of the death of [MISC Spanish  ] TV camerman [PER Jose Couse  ] in the [LOC Palestine Hotel  ] in [LOC Baghdad  ] in 2003 . 
The [ORG GOS  ] has been helpful behind the scenes in getting the case appealed by the [MISC Spanish  ] Prosecutor . 
The case now moves to the appeals tribunal of the [ORG National Court  ] , which will rule on the substance of the charges . 
We want continued vigilance and cooperation by the [ORG GOS  ] until the case is dropped. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) [PER Moratinos  ] holds you in very high regard and values the contacts that he has had with you . 
Your efforts and those of other senior [ORG USG  ] officials , along with mine , to help guide [PER Moratinos  ] on key issues such as handling [LOC Russia  ] in the [ORG OSCE  ] and on the full range of [LOC Middle East  ] issues , can prove effective . 
The more outreach the better , as we try to play to his desire to have a role on major issues while helping to direct some of these efforts toward policies that work to support [LOC US  ] global objectives. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( U ) You may want to congratulate [PER Moratinos  ] on the upcoming celebration of the 50th anniversary of the [ORG Commission  ] for [ORG Cultural  ] , [ORG Educational  ] and [ORG Scientific Exchange  ] between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Spain  ] ( the [ORG Fulbright Commission  ] ) and express how you look forward to hearing more about the events planned to take place in [LOC Washington  ] to commemorate this major milestone . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG Fulbright Commission  ] , the second largest in [LOC Europe  ] , is a truly binational organization with the majority of funding provided by the [MISC Spanish  ] central government , as well as regional autonomous communities and private sector entities. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) In all , you will find a rich agenda with [LOC Spain  ] , which your visit can advance substantially . 
Again , welcome to [LOC Madrid  ] . 
We are looking forward to your visit on June 1 . 
AGUIRRE</pre></code>
