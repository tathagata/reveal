[LOC BERLIN  ] 1162 Classified By: MINISTER COUNSELOR FOR POLITICAL AFFAIRS GEORGE GLASS FO R REASONS 1.4 ( B ) and ( D ) SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C/NF ) This is not a " change " election . 
The [MISC German  ] public does not see the September 27 parliamentary elections as decisive , and on many foreign policy fronts , including [LOC Afghanistan  ] , arms control , and [LOC Russia  ] , we do not foresee significant or distinct policy differences between the two most feasible coalition options . 
The most likely results of the elections are a [PER CDU/CSU-FDP  ] ( black-yellow ) coalition or a continued [ORG CDU/CSU-SPD Grand Coalition  ] . 
However , in some areas there may be changes , including on [LOC Iran  ] , tax policy , and nuclear energy . 
More importantly , there may be a new foreign minister who will likely need to get up to speed quickly on such crucial issues as [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and [ORG NATO  ] 's strategic posture . 
Leaders from the [ORG CDU/CSU  ] and [ORG FDP  ] promise a government more friendly toward the [LOC United States  ] . 
The near certainty that [PER Angela Merkel  ] will remain chancellor argues for this , but the unpredictability of Foreign Minister-aspirant and [ORG FDP  ] Chairman [PER Guido Westerwelle  ] may call for focused diplomatic engagement with the new [ORG FDP  ] political actors ( see REFTEL E for Post 's comprehensive expose of [PER Westerwelle  ] ) . 
END SUMMARY . 
BLACK-YELLOW ( CDU/CSU-FDP ) ? --------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) It is virtually certain that [PER Angela Merkel  ] will retain her position as Chancellor after this Sunday 's elections . 
But it is impossible to predict the final composition of the next coalition given that about a third of the electorate is still undecided and the polls show only a narrow parliamentary majority for black-yellow . 
Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] has repeatedly voiced her preference for a black-yellow coalition and has promised to form one even with a one-vote parliamentary majority . 
The [ORG FDP  ] 's [PER Westerwelle  ] has echoed this sentiment as its first choice as well. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) The [ORG SPD  ] has almost no prospect of leading a government and is only likely to remain in power as a weakened junior partner in another [ORG Grand Coalition  ] , should the CDU/CSU-FDP come up short of a parliamentary majority . 
The [ORG SPD  ] has failed to gain much momentum , although it has more recently risen a couple of points in the polls . 
It continues to suffer from an inability to profile itself against the [ORG CDU  ] ( or even a lack of desire to break with the [ORG CDU  ] in any significant way ) , with which it has been in government for the past four years . 
Also unhelpful have been a string of losses in local , state , and the June [ORG European Parliament  ] elections. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) [LOC U.S.  ] interests will not only be affected by the composition of the next coalition but also which parties are in the opposition . 
A CDU/CSU-FDP coalition would bring to power a new set of top players at the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] , [ORG Justice  ] , [ORG Environment  ] , and at either Economics or Finance ( as well as probably at least one other [MISC FDP-led  ] ministry with some turnover in [ORG CDU/CSU  ] ministries as well ) . 
The extent to which policy will change is less obvious , however , because [ORG FDP  ] Chairman and Foreign Minister aspirant [PER Guido Westerwelle  ] has promised considerable continuity with [PER Steinmeier  ] 's approach to foreign policy . 
In addition , the [ORG FDP  ] 's economic reform goals will face considerable resistance from the [MISC Bavarian  ] [ORG CSU  ] as well as parts of the [ORG CDU  ] . 
The lack of coordination and consistency , including between the [ORG Chancellery  ] and [ORG MFA  ] , that often occurs in [MISC German  ] policy making will continue to be a challenge for the [LOC United States.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) A black-yellow coalition will face a more united opposition led by an [ORG SPD  ] that is likely to move left if it leaves government and seeks to profile itself against the [ORG Greens  ] and the [ORG Left Party  ] , based on the profiles of [ORG SPD  ] leaders waiting in the wings for [PER Steinmeier  ] and [ORG SPD  ] Chairman [LOC BERLIN  ] 00001176 002 OF 006 [PER Franz Muentefering  ] to leave . 
[MISC German  ] governments can operate with narrow majorities due to strict party discipline ( which gets stricter the narrower the majority ) , but [PER Merkel  ] has not shown much courage in using her considerable personal popularity to push through policies that lack public support . 
On [LOC Afghanistan  ] , in particular , a black-yellow coalition may seek to simply roll over the [ORG ISAF  ] mandate unchanged when it comes up for renewal in December , rather than risk a row in the [ORG Bundestag  ] over an increase in the troop ceiling , which the [ORG Defense Ministry  ] has concluded is necessary to deal with the growing insurgency in the [MISC German  ] north . 
OR [ORG GRAND COALITION  ] ( [ORG CDU/CSU-SPD  ] ) ? --------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) However , another [ORG Grand Coalition  ] cannot be discounted , even though nobody professes to want it . 
It is a historical fact that the center-right parties have not won a parliamentary majority since 1994 . 
Another [ORG Grand Coalition  ] would almost certainly be even more difficult for the [ORG CDU/CSU  ] and the [ORG SPD  ] than the current one since both parties would be eyeing each other with distrust and the expectation that the government may not last an entire term . 
Further , [PER Merkel  ] 's position within her party would be weakened by what would be viewed as her failure to achieve a coalition with the [ORG FDP  ] while the [MISC Free Democrats  ] would continue to take advantage of conservative dissatisfaction with the [ORG Grand Coalition  ] 's disgruntled [ORG CDU  ] voters. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) The [ORG SPD  ] leadership might be secretly relieved not to lose their government posts , but its continued partnership with the [ORG CDU/CSU  ] would likely cause further bleeding of the party 's more leftist supporters to the [ORG Greens  ] and [ORG Left Party  ] , further weakening its base . 
In addition , the [ORG SPD  ] left-right split might be exacerbated , with leftists tempted to prematurely rupture the [ORG Grand Coalition  ] to build a majority red-red-green government where the [ORG SPD  ] would hold the chancellorship . 
[ORG CDU  ] officials certainly believe -- and have told the [LOC Embassy  ] -- that they expect the [ORG SPD  ] would seek to replace a [ORG Grand Coalition  ] with a red-red-green one some time during the term . 
Even though [PER Steinmeier  ] has insisted that any coalition agreement would be for the entire legislative period , the distrust between the parties would remain . 
Plus , if the [ORG SPD  ] performs badly in the election , [PER Steinmeier  ] literally may no longer be in a position to keep his word . 
GERMANY'S NEXT FOREIGN MINISTER - [PER WESTERWELLE  ] OR [PER STEINMEIER  ] ? --------------------------------------------- --------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C/NF ) The election 's most obvious impact on bilateral relations will be in terms of a potential change in foreign ministers . 
Our extensive experience with [PER Steinmeier  ] allows us to comfortably predict how a [MISC Steinmeier-led  ] [ORG MFA  ] would pursue [MISC German  ] interests globally , and vis-a-vis the [LOC United States  ] . 
On the other hand , [PER Westerwelle  ] continues to remain an enigma who has been unable to establish himself as a significant voice on foreign affairs . 
The [ORG FDP  ] 's foreign policy spokesman [PER Werner Hoyer  ] -- a well known foreign policy analyst in [LOC Germany  ] and internationally , including in the [LOC United States  ] -- has taken the lead here . 
When we asked [PER Hoyer  ] this week what would change with [PER Westerwelle  ] , he struggled to say anything . 
[PER Westerwelle  ] is a domestic political animal with little appetite for foreign policy and international affairs . 
He will , therefore , continue to be dependent for foreign policy advice on his mentor , former Foreign Minister [PER Hans-Dietrich Genscher  ] as well as on [PER Hoyer  ] and whichever [ORG Ministry diplomats  ] gain his trust ( [ORG REFTEL  ] E ) . <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Westerwelle  ] 's attempt to position himself among [LOC Germany  ] 's foreign policy elite with a speech in May at the [MISC German  ] Foreign Relations Council ( [ORG DGAP  ] ) did not produce the intended results and instead revealed his limitations on such major issues as [LOC Middle East  ] peace . 
If [PER Westerwelle  ] becomes [LOC Germany  ] 's next foreign minister , his learning curve will be steep . 
[LOC Germany  ] 's small foreign and security policy elite -- already skeptical of [PER Westerwelle  ] -- will resent his rise into the second most powerful political office of the land . 
And we will be faced with the question of how best to approach someone who has clearly had a mixed relationship with the [LOC United States  ] . 
Despite [PER Westerwelle  ] 's praise and respect for the current [ORG Obama Administration  ] , we should not forget that , as part of the opposition , he has criticized the [LOC United States  ] for the last eight years , while at the same time [LOC BERLIN  ] 00001176 003 OF 006 offering very few ideas of his own on how to solve international problems ( see [ORG REFTEL  ] E ) . <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C/NF ) If [PER Steinmeier  ] is able to lead the [ORG SPD  ] to a strong enough showing to force a [ORG Grand Coalition  ] , he certainly could maintain his position as Foreign Minister . 
He would also have the increased political clout provided by a mandate in the [ORG Bundestag  ] and his success in blocking a [MISC CDU/CSU-FDP  ] coalition . 
Obviously , there would be a high degree of foreign policy continuity . 
Unlike [PER Westerwelle  ] , [PER Steinmeier  ] is already on board with both sides of the [LOC U.S.  ] approach to [LOC Iran  ] , and he has told the Ambassador that he supports additional sanctions should [LOC Tehran  ] fail to respond to [LOC U.S.  ] overtures . 
However , competition between [PER Steinmeier  ] and [PER Merkel  ] over control of foreign policy will not end with the election , and [PER Steinmeier  ] would likely try to focus on a few key issues where he could differentiate himself and his party from [PER Merkel  ] and the [ORG CDU  ] , with arms control , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and [MISC Russian  ] relations being likely choices . 
[PER Steinmeier  ] wants to work closely with [LOC Washington  ] on these issues and is less likely to surprise [LOC Washington  ] than the [LOC Chancellery  ] would be. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C/NF ) The goodwill that marked the first year of the [ORG Grand Coalition  ] is unlikely to be repeated in a second term , particularly as [PER Steinmeier  ] contends with those in his own party who would prefer a leftist coalition . 
If there is not enough support for a [MISC CDU/CSU-FDP  ] coalition , then there would likely be a numerical red-red-green majority in the [ORG Bundestag  ] . 
The strained communication that currently marks Chancellery-MFA relations is likely to continue . 
Both [PER Steinmeier  ] and [PER Merkel  ] are responsible realists , however , who understand the need to work together on the big issues , as was evident during the [MISC Russian  ] invasion of [LOC Georgia  ] , their approach to the [LOC Middle East  ] , and their reaction to the international financial melt down . 
If new crises arise , the two are likely to continue to put their own interests aside long enough to speak with a single voice . 
FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES IN [MISC BLACK-YELLOW  ] AND GRAND COALITIONS --------------------------------------------- ------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C/NF ) [LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] ( Some Change ) : [PER Westerwelle  ] is one of the few [MISC German  ] politicians who justifies the [LOC Afghanistan  ] deployment on the basis of " [MISC German  ] national security interests " and the [ORG FDP  ] as a whole has been a consistent supporter of the [ORG ISAF  ] mandate . 
But with only a narrow majority in the [ORG Bundestag  ] and facing an [ORG SPD  ] opposition ready to accuse them of militarizing the [MISC German  ] mission , a [MISC CDU-CSU/FDP  ] coalition ironically might be less willing ( and able ) to push through necessary troop increases than a [ORG Grand Coalition  ] . 
On the other hand , there is likely to be no difference between the two on the support for police training , economic assistance and other civilian aid. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) ARMS CONTROL/NONPROLIFERATION ( [PER Little  ] change ) : [PER Westerwelle  ] proudly says that the motto of the [ORG MFA  ] under his leadership will be " peace through disarmament , " thereby seeking to be even more pro-arms control than [PER Steinmeier  ] . 
Although [PER Westerwelle  ] has called for the removal of all [LOC U.S.  ] tactical nuclear weapons from [MISC German  ] soil by 2013 , it is questionable whether he will manage to include this in a coalition agreement with the [MISC CDU/CSU  ] given their likely resistance. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C/NF ) [LOC RUSSIA  ] ( No change ) : Like the [ORG SPD  ] , the [ORG FDP  ] sees [LOC Russia  ] as a " strategic partner " in addressing issues such as [LOC Iran  ] , energy , and [LOC Afghanistan  ] and believes engagement and assistance with modernization is the best way to address [LOC Russia  ] 's democratic deficits . 
Like [PER Merkel  ] and [PER Steinmeier  ] , [PER Westerwelle  ] has pursued close ties to [MISC Russian  ] leaders , including Foreign Minister [PER Lavrov  ] and Defense Minister [PER Ivanov  ] , both of whom gave him high-profile meetings in [LOC Moscow  ] this past spring. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C/NF ) [LOC IRAN  ] ( Some change ) : [PER Steinmeier  ] has been a steady supporter of [LOC US  ] policy toward [LOC Iran  ] -- both in terms of dialogue and the need for increased sanctions if necessary , while [PER Westerwelle  ] has spoken almost exclusively about the need for dialogue . 
In addition , [PER Westerwelle  ] 's [ORG FDP  ] 's pro-business orientation makes it particularly skeptical of sanctions and is also resistant to unilateral efforts to cut back trade . 
[PER Merkel  ] will likely have to take a stronger role in this issue to keep [LOC Germany  ] 's position from falling back to [LOC BERLIN  ] 00001176 004 OF 006 the least common denominator. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C/NF ) [LOC TURKEY  ] ( Some change ) : A black-yellow coalition may result in a subtle , less favorable , shift in [LOC Germany  ] 's policy towards [LOC Turkey  ] with the exit of the [ORG SPD  ] -- [LOC Turkey  ] 's staunchest supporter -- from the government . 
Although [ORG FDP  ] foreign policy experts recognize that [ORG EU  ] membership is an important factor in encouraging additional domestic reforms in [LOC Turkey  ] , it has kept an open mind on the issue . 
However , the [ORG FDP  ] is more vocal than the [ORG SPD  ] in its criticism of [LOC Turkey.  ] <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C/NF ) [ORG MIDDLE  ] EAST ( [PER Little  ] change ) : [PER Westerwelle  ] 's views on [LOC Israel  ] and [LOC Middle East  ] peace may stem more from his past experience in addressing criticism against [LOC Israel  ] and his interpretation of [LOC Germany  ] 's historical role toward [LOC Israel  ] than from his own [LOC Middle East  ] policy or strategic calculations . 
Some attribute [PER Westerwelle  ] 's current pro-Israel stance as the result of his having been burned politically both domestically and in [LOC Israel  ] in 2002 . 
At that time , [PER Westerwelle  ] defended an [ORG FDP  ] politician , [PER Juergen Moellemann  ] , who had published a brochure strongly critical of then [MISC Israeli  ] Prime Minister [PER Ariel Sharon  ] 's actions towards the [MISC Palestinians  ] . 
Some claimed the brochure was anti-Semitic . 
While in [LOC Israel  ] shortly thereafter , [PER Westerwelle  ] was questioned by then-PM [PER Sharon  ] about what [PER Sharon  ] referred to as a growing anti-Semitism in [LOC Germany  ] and [LOC Europe  ] . 
In an August 2009 interview with " [PER Der Spiegel  ] , " [PER Westerwelle  ] explained his decision to vote against [LOC Germany  ] 's participation in [LOC UNIFIL  ] with his view that [LOC Germany  ] cannot take a neutral position in the [LOC Middle East  ] because of its past . 
He noted that he had visited the [LOC Golan Heights  ] in [LOC Israel  ] as a young man and was impressed with the vulnerability of the country . 
Even more so than [PER Steinmeier  ] , however , [PER Westerwelle  ] may seek a greater role for [LOC Germany  ] and the [ORG EU  ] in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
In the " [PER Spiegel  ] " interview , he called for the [ORG EU  ] to launch an initiative to establish a conference for security and cooperation in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
We could expect both [PER Steinmeier  ] and [PER Westerwelle  ] to hold to [LOC U.S.  ] messages on the [LOC Middle East  ] , with both competing with the [LOC Chancellery  ] for the lead on this issue. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C/NF ) [LOC GUANTANAMO  ] ( No change ) : [PER Steinmeier  ] would likely take a more accommodating approach toward [LOC Germany  ] accepting some of the [LOC Guantanamo  ] detainees than would [PER Westerwelle  ] , but the key ministry in deciding this issue will continue to be [ORG Interior  ] . 
In either a black-yellow or another [ORG Grand Coalition  ] , [PER Wolfgang Schaeuble  ] ( [ORG CDU  ] ) could continue on as Interior Minister , although there is some talk of his being named as [ORG EU  ] commissioner . 
[PER Schaeuble  ] has been very skeptical of accepting detainees from a security standpoint . 
More recently , he told the Ambassador that [LOC Germany  ] would only take detainees who will require no surveillance. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG ECONOMIC CRISIS/INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REGULATION  ] ( [LOC Little Change  ] ) : All potential government parties share a similar strategy ; increase regulation and supervision of the financial sector with differences at the margin . 
The [ORG SPD  ] advocates taxing share trades over 1000 euros and monitoring private equity funds more closely , while the [MISC CDU/CSU  ] and [ORG FDP  ] propose concentrating financial supervision under the [ORG Bundesbank  ] . 
A black-yellow government would result in a new Finance Minister ; if [PER Karl Theodor  ] zu [PER Guttenberg  ] remains at the [ORG Economics Ministry  ] , then the [ORG FDP  ] might be given the Finance Minister , with [PER Hans-Otto Solms  ] , an experienced and cautious financial policy expert , the most likely replacement. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) CLIMATE CHANGE ( No Change ) : There is little difference between the parties on issues in play at the upcoming [ORG UNFCCC  ] 's [ORG COP-15  ] in [LOC Copenhagen  ] , and [PER Merkel  ] maintains strong control over [MISC German  ] policy in this area . 
There will be a new Environment Minister should a black-yellow government be formed , however , and it is unclear which party would then control the [ORG Ministry  ] . 
In previous CDU/CSU-FDP coalitions , the [ORG CDU  ] ran it but if the [ORG FDP  ] does as well as current polls suggest , it might make a play for the [ORG Ministry  ] . 
Current [ORG SPD  ] Environment Minister [PER Sigmar Gabriel  ] has had a high profile in his party 's [ORG Bundestag  ] campaign and could remain in place in a [ORG Grand Coalition.  ] <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) ENERGY ( Some Change ) : The [ORG SPD  ] insisted on continuation of the previous government 's plan to phase out nuclear power plants during the last coalition negotiations [LOC BERLIN  ] 00001176 005 OF 006 and would stick to this position again . 
In contrast , the [ORG FDP  ] has been the party most open to nuclear energy , insisting that the phase-out itself should be at least slowed down to protect [LOC Germany  ] 's supply of energy . 
The [MISC CSU/CSU  ] also wants to extend the possible life of existing nuclear power plants , provided they are safe , during a " transitional " period to provide time for [LOC Germany  ] to switch to greater reliance on renewable sources . 
Recent controversies over the safety of some nuclear power plants have made [PER Merkel  ] and even the [ORG FDP  ] less willing to press for reliance on nuclear energy. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C/NF ) DATA PROTECTION ( [LOC Little Change  ] ) : Data privacy has been a second-tier campaign issue but does arise in debates on domestic security policy . 
Another [ORG Grand Coalition  ] could leave Justice Minister [PER Brigitte Zypries  ] ( [ORG SPD  ] ) in place ; she reluctantly agreed to the landmark data sharing initiative on serious crime and terrorism suspects ( the [MISC Pruem-like  ] agreement ) due to privacy concerns . 
A CDU/CSU-FDP coalition might return [PER Sabine Leutheusser-Scharrenberger  ] to the [ORG Justice Ministry  ] , which she headed from 1992-96 in the last black-yellow coalition ( she resigned her office after the her party agreed to wiretapping legislation proposed by the [ORG CDU/CSU  ] ) . 
She or any [ORG FDP  ] Justice Minister would likely continue to see their role as the protector of civil liberties and therefore they would carefully scrutinize all bilateral and [MISC U.S.-EU  ] data sharing initiatives. <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( C/NF ) COUNTER-TERRORISM/LAW ENFORCEMENT ( [PER Little  ] change ) : The [ORG CDU  ] will likely remain in control of the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] regardless of the coalition , and [PER Schaeuble  ] , although 67 , is likely but not certain to stay on for another term . 
He has brought [MISC U.S.-German  ] CT cooperation to an unprecedented level , and no other [MISC German  ] official has offered as much cooperation ( except on the issue of resettling [LOC Guantanamo  ] detainees where the focus on internal [MISC German  ] security supersedes his desire to work with [LOC Washington  ] ) . 
Any possible replacement -- Chancellery Chief [PER Thomas de Maiziere  ] has been mentioned in the press -- is unlikely to have his authority or expertise but will likely continue his policies. <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( U ) TRADE ( No change ) : All five parties are committed to open market but the [ORG SPD  ] , [ORG Greens  ] , and The [ORG Left Party  ] want environmental and social standards included while the [MISC CDU/CSU  ] stresses the need for protection of intellectual property and the [ORG FDP  ] worries about domestic subsidies and market access . 
None of the parties wants to restructure the [MISC German  ] economy to reduce export-dependency and address global imbalances . 
Other [LOC U.S.  ] interests , such as concluding the [LOC Doha  ] round of trade negotiations , would not likely be affected by a change in coalition. <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( U ) TAX POLICY ( Some change ) : Tax policy is often cited as the area where a black-yellow government would produce change . 
The [ORG FDP  ] proposes a radical overhaul of the tax system to simplify the tax code and stagger the corporate rate . 
CSU leader and [PER Bavaria Minister-President  ] [PER Horst Seehofer  ] has been critical of the [ORG FDP  ] plan , which he says will run up the deficit and impose an excessive burden on the public budget . 
Neither the [ORG CDU/CSU  ] 's nor [ORG FDP  ] 's tax proposals are realistic , however , in light of budget deficits that are expected to be more than 2 percent this year and 4 percent in 2010 , just as mid-term targets for [LOC Germany  ] 's balanced budget amendment kick in . 
Some sort of tax increase therefore is a near certainty , perhaps in the form of an increase in the value-added tax . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( C/NF ) Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] will continue to exert strong influence on [MISC German  ] foreign policy in an attempt to create a political legacy in international affairs . 
This will be true whether the [ORG MFA  ] is led by [ORG Steinmeier  ] or [PER Westerwelle  ] . 
We can also predict that tensions between the Chancellery and [ORG MFA  ] will remain based on different coalition partners controlling them . 
If [ORG Steinmeier  ] returns to office , he will be a reliable partner . 
[PER Westerwelle  ] is a wild card ; his exuberant personality does not lend itself to taking a back seat to Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] on any issue . 
If he becomes foreign minister , there is the possibility of higher profile discord between the Chancellery and [ORG MFA  ] . 
This may demand focused diplomatic engagement by the [ORG USG  ] with the new [ORG FDP  ] political actors . 
END COMMENT .
