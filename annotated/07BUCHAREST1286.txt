( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] The impending “final offer” by the [ORG U.S. Army Foreign Claims Service  ] , [LOC Europe  ] to the family of the late [MISC Romanian  ] rock star [PER Teofil Peter  ] , who was killed in a 2004 car accident involving Embassy Bucharest’s former Marine detcommander , seems certain to have a significant , negative effect on the [MISC U.S.-Romanian  ] relationship . 
In the likely event that the family of [PER Peter  ] will go public with the news that the [LOC U.S.  ] government has met their multi-million dollar settlement claim with an offer of only $80,000 , [MISC Romanian  ] leaders and opinion makers will react loudly and emotionally , calling into question some of the most important features of our bilateral partnership . 
President [PER Basescu  ] , PM [PER Tariceanu  ] and other prominent politicians will almost certainly rally to the family’s side , even if some normally pro-American officials will still try behind the scenes to calm the anticipated public outrage . 
In particular , the popular outcry over what will be seen by most [MISC Romanians  ] as an insultingly small offer to [MISC Peter’s  ] survivors will prompt renewed calls , with much more potential popular support , for the rapid withdrawal of [MISC Romanian  ] troops from [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Likewise , backing in the [MISC Romanian  ] parliament and among members of the public for the new [LOC U.S.  ] troop presence at joint [MISC U.S.-Romanian  ] military facilities on the [LOC Black Sea  ] will plummet , at least temporarily . 
The November 21 notification date to the [PER Peter  ] family’s lawyers is fast approaching , and will nearly coincide with the December 4 anniversary date of [MISC Peter’s  ] death , the occasion for past anti-U.S. demonstrations in [LOC Romania  ] . 
In short , we are bracing ourselves for a stormy downturn in the relationship , prompted by the continuing negative legacy of the death of this [MISC Romanian  ] cultural icon . 
Some of the damage to our popular standing and to our interests in [LOC Romania  ] may be lasting . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Teo Peter  ] , one of [MISC Romania’s  ] best known and most beloved rock musicians , was killed on December 4 , 2004 , in a [LOC Bucharest  ] car accident involving the taxi he was riding in and the official [ORG Embassy  ] vehicle being driven in the early morning hours by former [ORG Bucharest Marine  ] detachment commander Staff Sgt. [PER Christopher Van Goethem  ] . 
[PER Van Goethem  ] departed [LOC Romania  ] within a few hours after the accident , under the terms of his diplomatic immunity , but many [MISC Romanians  ] viewed his abrupt departure before local investigators had the opportunity to question him and conduct tests on his blood alcohol level as a slap in the face and an effort to shield the Marine from justice . 
Demonstrations were held outside the [ORG Embassy  ] , and an effort was made to rename a nearby street after the deceased musician . 
Sgt. [PER Van Goethem  ] did subsequently face a range of charges in the [LOC U.S.  ] military justice system . 
A military courts martial concluded in January 2006 that while he was guilty of making false statements and obstructing justice , he was not guilty of the more serious negligent homicide charge . 
The jury , somewhat unexpectedly , limited the [MISC Marine’s  ] punishment to an official letter of reprimand . 
This news brought , in turn , another wave of protests. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [ORG U.S. Army Claims Service  ] , [LOC Europe  ] currently plans to send legal representatives of the [PER Peter  ] family final offers amounting to $80,000 , divided among three claimants , including [PER Teofil Claudiu Peter  ] , the musician’s son . 
In briefing material recently forwarded to the [ORG Embassy  ] , the [ORG Army’s Foreign Claims Service  ] states that the [PER Peter  ] family claims were adjudicated pursuant to the Foreign Claims Act , which “uses foreign law to measure damages.” The accompanying press guidance then asserts: “That means the law of the country in which the claim arises are used -- in tQs case [MISC Romanian  ] law.” “The awards are consistent with [MISC Romanian  ] court decisions measuring damages in similar cases , ” the guidance continues , “and reflect [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Romanian  ] principles of just compensation and respect for human life.” The [ORG U.S. Army Claims Service  ] , [LOC Europe  ] documents go on to say that the Service contracted “a prestigious [MISC Romanian  ] law firm to advise the [ORG Commission  ] on the pertinent provisions of the [MISC Romanian  ] law.. . 
( and ) determined that the amount requested by the claimants greatly exceeded the economic loss substantiated by the claimants . 
Moreover , the [ORG Commission  ] found no relevant precedent justifying an award of moral damages anywhere near the amount requested.” Part of the award that has been approved will be centered on reimbursing BUCHAREST 00001286 002 OF 003 the family for the funeral costs of Mr. [PER Peter’s  ] burial. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Teo [MISC Peter’s  ] survivors reportedly initially requested a multi-million dollar settlement . 
In a November 1 letter to the Ambassador from the [PER Peter  ] family’s law firm , [LOC Arent Fox  ] , attorney [PER John M. Gurley  ] suggests that the claimants are currently requesting an award of $1 million . 
In what is labeled “The [PER Peter Family  ] Claim: October 2007 , ” [PER Gurley  ] cites various past precedents for awards at that level or above , including for an [MISC Australian  ] woman’s successful claim for $1 million after being hit by a [ORG Navy  ] serviceman’s golf ball , and a $1.9 million claim to survivors of a teenage [MISC Mexican  ] goat herder , the victim ostensibly of an accident involving the [LOC U.S.  ] military . 
[PER Gurley  ] also cites the $2 million awards presented to the survivors of the [MISC Italian  ] cable car accident involving a [LOC U.S.  ] warplane , a case which has been cited repeatedly in the [MISC Romanian  ] media and by [MISC Romanian  ] government officials . 
[PER Gurley  ] writes in his letter that he had unsuccessfully requested a transfer of the claim from the [ORG U.S. Army Claims Service  ] , [LOC Europe  ] in [LOC Mannheim  ] to [LOC Fort Meade  ] ( the headquarters of the [ORG Claims Service  ] ) or [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC D.C.  ] Citing “the very discouraging signals” the [PER Peter  ] family has received to date from the [ORG Claims Service  ] , [PER Gurley  ] concludes by saying he hoped the [PER Peter  ] claim could be settled “in a manner suitable to all parties” before the April 2008 [ORG NATO  ] summit in [LOC Bucharest  ] , asserting that “it would truly be unfortunate for [LOC Romania  ] , as well as the [LOC United States  ] , if the [ORG NATO  ] summit were to be marred by the [LOC U.S.  ] government’s inability to close the [PER Teo Peter  ] matter in a fair fashion.” <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Once the award is communicated to the family’s legal counsel at [PER Arent Fox  ] on Wednesday , November 21 ( the day before Thanksgiving ) , we expect the family and its legal representatives to move quickly to condemn the [LOC U.S.  ] offer publicly and to appeal to top [MISC Romanian  ] officials and the [MISC Romanian  ] media to put immediate pressure on [LOC U.S.  ] representatives for a higher award . 
[MISC Romanian  ] MFA officials have reported to us informally that the family has met with the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister in recent weeks to express their determination to conduct a public fight should the final award offer be unacceptably low . 
Under these circumstances , and in light of the proximity to the anniversary of the rock musician’s death , we expect the [ORG Embassy  ] to be the focus of multiple demonstrations , including concerts and candlelight vigils . 
There will be a renewed effort to rename after [PER Teo Peter  ] the street on which the [ORG Embassy  ] is located , and it is possible that city officials may accede to the anticipated wave of public indignation over the amount of the award offer. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Another report we received in recent days was a suggestion that [MISC Romanian  ] law enforcement authorities , working through [ORG EU  ] channels , would attempt to serve a legal summons to [PER Van Goethem  ] , who we believe is currently a [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Embassy  ] dependent at [LOC AmEmbassy Berlin.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) More seriously , we anticipate that the [PER Peter  ] award offer , and subsequent media attention , will embolden critics of the [MISC Romanian  ] deployment in [LOC Iraq  ] , along with other anti-American politicians like [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] President [PER Bogdan Olteanu  ] , to call for the immediate withdrawal of [MISC Romanian  ] troops . 
Under these circumstances , they could build sufficient traction to reinvigorate the opposition to Romania’s support for [LOC U.S.  ] efforts there , and potentially force a change in policy . 
While President [PER Basescu  ] has been steadfast in his support for our continued troop presence in [LOC Iraq  ] , he would be conscious of the fact that even before a renewed public outcry over the [PER Peter  ] case , only one-third of the [MISC Romanian  ] public supports maintaining troops there . 
Either way , reinvigoration of the controversy over [LOC U.S.  ] handling of the case will put our closest friends within the [MISC Romanian  ] government , including President [PER Basescu  ] , into a very awkward political position . 
Likely enough , the [ORG Liberal Party  ] and other political groups hoping to find a hook to boost their support in the run-up to the November 25 Euro-parliamentary elections in [LOC Romania  ] will wrap themselves in the flag and try to capitalize on the political moment with anti-U.S. political rhetoric . 
More broadly , news of the [PER Peter  ] award offer will cut deeply into support for the new [LOC U.S.  ] military presence at joint facilities on the [LOC Black Sea  ] , including [MISC Kogalniceanu  ] air base and the [LOC Babadag  ] training grounds -- at least temporarily . 
While public approval of the bases has been steady , our contacts have always cautioned us that it is vulnerable to concerns over an increased terrorist threat to [LOC Romania  ] -- and to negative stories concerning the conduct of [LOC U.S.  ] service personnel , with the first point of reference the [ORG Teo Peter  ] accident and the subsequent handling of the charges against Sgt. [PER Van Goethem.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) There are other , less predictable , risk factors at play . 
In the wake of this week’s controversy over the Ambassador’s criticism of the Parliament’s efforts to undermine the independence of [MISC Romanian  ] prosecutors and their ability to investigate cases of bribery and corruption , a controversy over the [ORG Teo Peter  ] award could enable our critics and opponents on the [MISC Romanian  ] political scene to undermine other important initiatives which are just gathering momentum . 
First and foremost among them is our accelerating effort , alongside [ORG Lockheed-Martin  ] , to persuade [LOC Romania  ] to pursue an [MISC F-16/JSF  ] option to replace the country’s aging MiG fleet . 
[ORG Lockheed-Martin  ] , in tandem with allies in the [LOC Presidency  ] and [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] , are seeking a “sole-source” route to the fighter plane decision , which they do not want to see tied up in the [LOC Brussels  ] bureaucracy by the [MISC F-16/JSF’s  ] principal [MISC European  ] competitors , [ORG Grippen  ] and [ORG Eurofighter  ] . 
This was always going to be a tricky exercise , with an expectation that supporters of a [MISC European  ] fighter option would loudly cry foul . 
A firestorm over the [ORG Teo Peter  ] case could possibly represent a tipping point away from a [LOC U.S.  ] option , if only because of the optics. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) What little guidance we have received from the [ORG U.S. Army Claims Service  ] , [LOC Europe  ] suggests that all [MISC Romanian  ] media inquiries are to be steered towards the [ORG USAREUR  ] public affairs staff , or alternatively [ORG USMC  ] spokespersons at [LOC Quantico  ] . 
This will limit severely our ability to respond here in [LOC Romania  ] , and to help address some of the most pernicious charges that we will face . 
We believe that the risk of unintended consequences in this media strategy , across geographic , language and cultural barriers , is huge . 
That , too , has to be factored into our overall risk assessment of the impending [ORG Claims Service  ] actions. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) In short , our hope is that this latest policy and public affairs challenge related to the 2004 car accident will be manageable . 
But we are concerned that under the present circumstances , some lasting damage could be done to our core interests , including keeping [MISC Romanian  ] troops deployed in [LOC Iraq  ] and continuing to build on the positive momentum in our close defense and security partnership with [LOC Bucharest  ] . 
This has been an especially difficult issue from the beginning , and remains the biggest single “black spot” in our recent bilateral experience .
