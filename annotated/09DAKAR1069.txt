( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY: Details have continued to emerge regarding [MISC Senegalese  ] President [PER Abdoulaye Wade  ] 's project for a " Monument of the [MISC African Renaissance  ] . 
" To pay off the [MISC North Korean  ] firm that is constructing the monument , a valuable tract of land is said to have been given to [PER Mbackeou Faye  ] , one of [PER Wade  ] 's prominent supporters , with the instructions that [PER Faye  ] should pay the cost of construction ( believed to be $25-35 million ) to the [LOC North Koreans  ] with proceeds from selling the newly-acquired land . 
After paying off the [LOC North Koreans  ] , [PER Faye  ] will end up with a hefty profit from the land deal . 
In response to an inquiry from the [ORG European Union  ] ( [ORG EU  ] ) , Prime Minister [PER Souleymane Ndene Ndiaye  ] defended the land deal without really revealing any details . 
However , his additional assertion that the [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] ( [ORG MOF  ] ) had supervised the process conflicts with existing information . 
Additionally , [PER Wade  ] 's recent decision to claim 35 percent of the monument 's proceeds as an intellectual property right conflicts with [PER Ndiaye  ] 's assertion that the land deal was done transparently and within [ORG GOS  ] regulations . 
END SUMMARY . 
BACKGROUND ON THE MONUMENT -------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The execution of President [PER Wade  ] 's idea for a " Monument of the [MISC African Renaissance  ] " in [LOC Dakar  ] is currently in the process of being realized . 
A 100-plus [MISC North Korean  ] crew has been constructing the titanic , grandiose edifice of a style reminiscent of the [MISC Stalinesque  ] behemoths of the halcyon days of the [LOC Soviet Union  ] . 
As described by a [ORG GOS  ] brochure , the structure features an " [MISC African  ] man emerging from a volcano , facing the [LOC West  ] , with his wife , and he is holding his child up as if to show him to the world . 
" Reportedly , [PER Wade  ] sees the monument as a cultural legacy for himself and a tangible symbol mirroring his belief that [LOC Africa  ] must look to the future rather than be beholden to its past . 
THE MONUMENT ( al ) LAND DEAL ---------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Wade  ] appropriated a public piece of land occupying the western-most promontory of the [MISC Senegalese  ] coast , just northwest of downtown [LOC Dakar  ] to be used for the site of his proposed monument . 
He hired a [MISC North Korean  ] firm to construct the monument at a cost of [LOC CFA  ] 12-16 billion ( approximately [MISC USD  ] $25-35 million ) , according to [PER Wade  ] himself . 
To cover the costs of construction , rather than pay for the structure from the [ORG GOS  ] 's limited budget , a valuable tract of land near [LOC Dakar  ] 's airport was appropriated . 
Rather than sell the land itself , it is believed the [ORG North Koreans  ] and/or [ORG GOS  ] engaged the services of [PER Mbackeou Faye  ] , a prominent businessman and one of [PER Wade  ] 's close friends and loyal supporters , to commercialize the real estate . 
( COMMENT: Although the [ORG GOS  ] asserts that the [ORG North Koreans  ] chose [PER Faye  ] to develop and sell the property , it is all but certain that [PER Wade  ] himself chose [PER Faye  ] and merely told the [ORG North Koreans  ] whom to hire . 
END COMMENT ) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Faye  ] has sold 12 hectares of land thus far , to [PER Ipres  ] , a retirement and pension institution for private sector and nongovernment employees-civil servants , for [MISC USD  ] $54 million . 
( NOTE: pres is co-managed by the private sector and the [ORG GOS  ] , with [PER Wade  ] nominating the company 's director and the company 's private board confirming the nomination . 
END NOTE . 
) With the remaining land , [PER Faye  ] is believed to be planning to build 270 luxurious residences , each of which will cost [MISC USD  ] $300,000 . 
This is expected to bring him an additional [MISC USD  ] $81 million . 
After paying the [MISC North Korean  ] firm , [PER Faye  ] is expected to end up with a handsome profit from the deal . 
( COMMENT: Although [PER Ipres  ] 's board is technically independent , its members are vulnerable to political pressure from the Presidency . 
[PER Wade  ] can easily pull some strings at the company to push deals through . 
It is very probable that [PER Wade  ] had some say in [PER Ipres  ] 's land purchase . 
END COMMENT . 
) THE GOVERNMENT BEGINS TO CONTRADICT ITSELF ------------------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On June 30 , 2009 the [ORG EU  ] sent a letter to the [ORG GOS  ] questioning the land deal . 
In the letter , the [ORG EU  ] complained that the [ORG GOS  ] gave up a valuable revenue-generating opportunity while continuing to ask for budget support from donors. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On July 9 , Prime Minister [PER Souleymane Ndene Ndiaye  ] responded with a letter defending the land deal , essentially arguing that the [ORG GOS  ] had done nothing wrong , did not " sell " the land , and did not receive any money . 
The letter also argues that the [LOC North Koreans  ] , not the [ORG GOS  ] , chose [PER Faye  ] to develop the land . 
Furthermore , [ORG DAKAR  ] 00001069 002 OF 002 the letter asserts that the [ORG MOF  ] was involved in all aspects of the land deal . 
This is in direct contradiction to what [PER Abdoulaye Diop  ] , the Minister of Finance , asserted during the presentation of the revised 2009 budget at the [ORG National Assembly  ] . 
Essentially , the Minister stated that the [ORG MOF  ] was not involved in the monument land deal . 
( NOTE: According to [MISC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] the President handled the land deal himself without consulting the ministry , and that the Presidency , not the [ORG MOF  ] , controls all public land in the airport and upscale Almadies neighborhoods . 
END NOTE . 
) FURTHER CONTRADICTIONS ---------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) President [PER Wade  ] recently claimed that since the monument was his own personal idea he has a right to share in the proceeds , claiming intellectual property rights over the statue . 
[PER Wade  ] has subsequently created a foundation and claimed that 35 percent of the monument 's proceeds will go as royalties to the foundation . 
Additionally , [PER Wade  ] has named his son , [PER Karim Wade  ] , as the president of the foundation 's board of directors . 
The money that goes to the foundation will ostensibly be used to fund another of [PER Wade  ] 's pet projects , the " Cases de [PER Tout Petits  ] " . 
These " cases " are early childhood education centers , of which over 100 have been built throughout the country since 2000 . 
Although these " cases " are a good idea in theory , early childhood education is a luxury in a country where even universal primary education is unattainable . 
Most of the existing centers sit as empty shells , either locked or diverted to multiple other uses . 
MORE TO COME ? ------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In his letter , [PER Ndiaye  ] mentioned that a second land deal is likely in the works . 
He claimed that this deal will cover the costs of landscaping the monument grounds , the construction of a proposed museum and conference center inside the edifice , and the construction of parking lots and an amusement park . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The monument , the outer shell of which is missing only the man 's head , is now a prominent feature of greater [LOC Dakar  ] 's skyline clearly visible from most of the outer rim of the city . 
As it sits close enough to the flight path of planes landing at [LOC Dakar  ] 's international airport , it is ensured of becoming a topic of conversation for foreign visitors and those passing through . 
The [MISC Senegalese  ] man and woman on the street are also talking , most expressing the simple plaint that , if given the choice , they would have preferred electricity and running water .
