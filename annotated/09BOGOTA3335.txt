Brownfield  ] , Ambassador ; REASON: 1.4 ( B ) , ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) Just after meeting with President [PER Uribe  ] and the military high command , Minister of Defense [PER Gabriel Silva  ] called the Ambassador on the evening of November 8 . 
They believe that [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [LOC Chavez'  ] public declarations earlier that afternoon represented a major ratcheting up of war rhetoric . 
The [ORG GOC  ] regards the rhetoric as threatening . 
[PER Silva  ] acknowledged that the [ORG GOC  ] and [ORG USG  ] analyzed [LOC Chavez'  ] intentions differently , but he asked for two actions by the [ORG USG: -- First  ] , an immediate analysis of [MISC Venezuelan  ] military movements toward the border , and accelerated real time intelligence on such movements in the future . 
-- Second , some sort of [ORG USG  ] public comment on [LOC Chavez'  ] warlike rhetoric . 
The Ambassador said he was unaware ( at that time ) of [LOC Chavez'  ] latest declarations ; he would work to accelerate our analysis of possible military movements on the [MISC Venezuelan  ] side of the border ; and he would consult with [LOC Washington  ] on any [ORG USG  ] public response. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Immediately after the [ORG MOD  ] call , President [PER Uribe  ] called the Ambassador . 
[PER Uribe  ] repeated most of [PER Silva  ] 's points about [LOC Chavez'  ] latest rhetoric . 
He said the latest uptick was something he could not ignore , as [MISC Colombian  ] public opinion would not permit it . 
He had to respond in some way . 
[PER Uribe  ] planned to release a communique that evening ( [PER Note: It  ] was released and covered in the morning press . 
End note . 
) making four points: -- [ORG GOC  ] did not seek armed conflict with any other nation . 
-- [MISC Colombian  ] military efforts were directed against narcotrafficking and terrorism . 
-- [ORG GOC  ] supported resolving differences by dialogue through international law . 
-- But in light of [LOC Chavez'  ] latest declarations , [ORG GOC  ] would submit this matter to the [ORG UN Security Council  ] and the [ORG Organization of American States  ] ( [ORG OAS  ] ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) [PER Uribe  ] asked what the Ambassador advised . 
The Ambassador asked if he had spoken to [MISC Brazilian  ] President [PER Lula  ] . 
[PER Uribe  ] said no , but he would do so . 
The Ambassador suggested that [PER Uribe  ] ask himself what [PER Chavez  ] would want him to do , and then do something different . 
If [PER Chavez  ] wanted him to respond with heated rhetoric that would help him conceal internal problems in [LOC Venezuela  ] from his own people , then [PER Uribe  ] should not fall into that trap . 
[PER Uribe  ] agreed . 
He asked for any further advice the [ORG USG  ] might offer. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) AMBASSADOR'S COMMENT: This is further evidence that the [MISC Colombians  ] are working themselves into a sweat over the potential military threat from [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
We will work directly with [MISC SouthCom  ] and [ORG ORA  ] on the [ORG GOC  ] request for accelerated intelligence on military movements in [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
We do not regard [LOC Chavez'  ] latest blast as a significant increase over what he has already said , and do not necessarily recommend that [LOC Washington  ] treat this as a genuine crisis . 
Obviously , we will have to determine our posture should the [ORG GOC  ] submit this issue to the [ORG Security Council  ] or [ORG OAS  ] . 
Equally obviously , we should factor into our thinking the fact that the [ORG GOC  ] has become almost neuralgic about the [LOC Venezuela  ] threat . 
Correct or not , it is something we must consider as we make our own policy decisions in the region . 
End Comment .
