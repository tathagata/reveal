End Summary . 
2 . 
( C ) During a November 18 meeting with Pol/Econ Chief , Dr. [PER Ahmed Hesnawy  ] , head of [LOC Libya  ] 's chemical weapons destruction program , thanked the [ORG USG  ] for its support for [LOC Libya  ] 's extension and amendment requests on its CWC-related commitments during the October 12 Executive Council session ( [MISC EC-58  ] ) of the [ORG Organization  ] for the [ORG Prohibition of Chemical Weapons  ] ( [ORG OPCW  ] ) . 
He requested continued support during the upcoming Conference of the [ORG States Parties  ] ( [ORG CSP  ] ) . 
[PER Hesnawy  ] said that he appreciated the [LOC U.S.  ] position and the support that came from the [LOC UK  ] and [ORG EU  ] delegations during [MISC EC-58  ] . 
However , he noted his disappointment with the [LOC UK  ] delegation 's silence when the [ORG EU  ] delegation expressed its reservations about the [MISC Libyan  ] extension request . 
He said that the [LOC UK  ] delegation had been briefed from the very beginning on the progress of [LOC Libya  ] 's program and " was aware of all the factors " that surrounded the two [MISC Libyan  ] requests , but had not shared information on [LOC Libya  ] 's progress with [ORG EU  ] counterparts . 
[PER Hesnawy  ] planned to express his thoughts directly to the [LOC UK  ] Embassy in [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
UPDATE ON DESTRUCTION , CONVERSION PROGRAMS 3 . 
( C ) [PER Hesnawy  ] shared a brief update on the status of the destruction facility . 
He expressed his hope that his agency would be able to make a final decision on the process for destroying four chemicals . 
Regarding the plan for building the actual destruction site , he said that the [MISC Libyans  ] had discussed beginning the civil work on the site and the schedule for destruction with the [ORG OPCW Secretariat  ] . 
From a technical point of view , he predicted that progress would be visible around March or April . 
He said that he had enjoyed a great relationship with members of the [ORG Secretariat  ] and that his only objection to the program was that the current members would be replaced with others who may not be as understanding of the many unique issues that [LOC Libya  ] is confronting in its attempts to fulfill its CWC-related commitments . 
4 . 
( C ) [PER Hesnawy  ] then gave an update on the status of the [LOC Rabta  ] conversion . 
He said that the conversion of the [LOC Rabta  ] facility would be done next month , before December 31 . 
He said that he had sent a letter last week to the [MISC Libyan  ] pharmaceutical company that was going to operate the facility , alerting it to the need to be ready for the [ORG OPCW  ] inspection by January 1 . 
[MISC LIBYAN  ] PARTICIPATION AT [ORG CSP  ] 5 . 
( C ) [PER Hesnawy  ] related that he would not make a statement at the upcoming [ORG CSP  ] , but he expected the Head of the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Committee  ] for the [ORG CWC  ] , Mr. [PER Mohammed Rageb El Ghadi  ] , to give an update on [LOC Libya  ] 's progress . 
He characterized such statements as " political " and insisted that he was not a politician but rather a technical specialist and would offer technical updates to all delegations who requested them , including the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC UK  ] teams . 
[PER Hesnawy  ] stated that he was happy to meet for a preparatory working session in The [ORG Hague  ] with the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC UK  ] delegations , but that he could not meet the week before the [ORG CSP  ] due to religious ( Eid al [PER Kabeer  ] ) holidays . 
He said he would arrive in The [ORG Hague  ] on November 29 and could meet anytime after that . 
[PER Hesnawy  ] stated that it was easy to be upfront and transparent [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000933 002.2 OF 002 with information on [LOC Libya  ] 's progress toward fulfillment of its CWC-related commitments . 
Nodding to a portrait of [MISC Libyan  ] leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] , he stated , " I have instructions from the highest authority to close the file on this matter , and to get rid of the bloody stuff , " referring to [LOC Libya  ] 's chemical weapons and precursors . 
[ORG SIPSA  ] CONTRACT STATUS -- [MISC LIBYAN  ] AND [MISC ITALIAN  ] PERSPECTIVES 6 . 
( C ) In response to [MISC P/E  ] chief 's request for an updated on the status of the contract with the [MISC Italian  ] firm , [ORG SIPSA  ] , to build the chemical destruction facility , [PER Hesnawy  ] stated that he wanted to speak " off the record . 
" He said that he was thinking about awarding part of the contract for design and construction of the facility to a [MISC Libyan  ] firm and the other part to the [MISC Italian  ] firm . 
He had not yet informed the [MISC Italian  ] company of this development and did not know when he would do so . 
However , he stated that he wanted the [ORG USG  ] to know about his plans , as the [MISC Libyan  ] construction firm would probably need to purchase at least one piece of [MISC American  ] technology that would require an export license -- an " [MISC A-Cam  ] " manufactured by the company " [ORG OI Analight  ] . 
" 7 . 
( C ) In a separate conversion with [MISC P/E  ] chief on November 15 , [MISC Italian  ] xxxxxxxxxxxx expressed his skepticism about [LOC Libya  ] 's progress toward fulfilling its CWC-related commitments. xxxxxxxxxxxx stated that he had spoken on October 8 with the [ORG SIPSA  ] representative in charge of negotiating the contract with [PER Hesnawy  ] . 
At that time , a contract had not been signed for the construction of the facility , nor had [PER Hesnawy  ] asked [ORG SIPSA  ] to draw up alternative blueprints , as he indicated in Ref [PER B. SIPSA  ] was ready to commence work as soon as the [MISC Libyans  ] signed the contract with them . 
On the conversion site , xxxxxxxxxxxx said that the [MISC Italian  ] pharmaceutical company ( [MISC Pharmachem  ] ) had completed its work on the [LOC Rabta  ] facilities . 
However , the [MISC Libyans  ] are stalling on completion of the last phase of their contract -- to purchase the actual chemicals necessary for the production of pharmaceuticals . 
In xxxxxxxxxxxx 's view , this is just the [MISC Libyans'  ] way of maintaining leverage . 
As long as [LOC Libya  ] does not completely fulfill its obligations , it can still hold out for more " compensation . 
" 8 . 
( C ) Comment: While [PER Hesnawy  ] seemed confident in the progress being made on the conversion program , he did not have much specific information to share on progress toward the building and design of the destruction facility . 
It is unclear when the [MISC Libyans  ] intend to begin chemical destruction if construction of the destruction facility has not yet commenced . 
Post will follow up with the [MISC Italians  ] regarding the subject of the contract for the destruction facility .
