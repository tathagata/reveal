Robert Manzanares  ] , reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . ------- SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The [ORG Zapatero  ] government believes it has taken significant steps to put relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] back on track , such as agreeing to lead both a PRT and an FSB in western [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Military-to-military relations between [LOC Spain  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] have remained strong over the past 14 months despite the change in government , as has bilateral cooperation against terrorism . 
[LOC Spain  ] continues to provide [LOC U.S.  ] forces full access to its naval base at [LOC Rota  ] and its air base at [LOC Moron  ] , as well as providing blanket flight clearances for [LOC U.S.  ] forces moving to and from [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Defense Minister [PER Bono  ] will acknowledge that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Spain  ] still have differences over issues such as [LOC Venezuela  ] but will ask that the [LOC U.S.  ] focus on areas of cooperation , and not only on areas of disagreement . 
Your meeting with [PER Bono  ] can be an opportunity to send a clear message to the [MISC Spanish  ] government that while the [LOC U.S.  ] appreciates [LOC Spain  ] 's cooperation in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and other areas , the [LOC U.S.  ] remains concerned about [MISC Spanish  ] actions that negatively affect our interests , such as [ORG Zapatero  ] 's [LOC Venezuela  ] policy . 
End Summary. -------------------- MILITARY COOPERATION -------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) Military to military relations between [LOC Spain  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] remain very strong despite the change to a Socialist government ; the [ORG Zapatero  ] government has continued to provide broad access for [LOC U.S.  ] forces at [LOC Rota Naval Base  ] and [LOC Moron Air Base  ] . 
There are currently over 2500 active duty [LOC U.S.  ] military stationed at the two bases , the vast majority at [LOC Rota  ] . 
Including [LOC U.S.  ] civilians and dependents , the [MISC American  ] presence at the [MISC Spanish  ] bases tops 5,000 . 
[ORG Zapatero  ] has also left untouched [LOC Spain  ] 's practice of providing blanket flight clearances for [LOC U.S.  ] military aircraft , including in support of operations in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] military is still smarting from its ignominious withdrawal from [LOC Iraq  ] and , largely as a result of the [LOC Iraq  ] withdrawal , is displeased with the Socialist government . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] armed forces strongly support close relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] and consider [ORG Zapatero  ] 's distancing from the [LOC U.S.  ] a profound error. ----------------------------- COUNTER-TERRORISM COOPERATION ----------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) A critical element in our bilateral relationship is our high level of cooperation on law enforcement and counter-terrorism issues . 
[LOC Spain  ] remains an active front in the War on Terror . 
Investigations since the 3/11 attack have confirmed suspicions that there is a large pool of [MISC Islamic  ] extremists throughout the country , including one cell that plotted attacks against [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG High Court  ] and other targets during the latter half of 2004 . 
[ORG ETA  ] also continues to carry out small-scale bombings , though it has been greatly weakened in the last year by arrests of key leaders in [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC France  ] . 
[MISC Spanish  ] authorities arrested 117 suspected [MISC Islamic  ] terrorists during 2004 , routinely sharing with [ORG USG  ] officials information derived from those arrests . 
Attorney General [PER Gonzales  ] and Minister of [PER Justice Aguilar  ] issued a joint statement on March 11 , 2005 committing the [ORG USG  ] and [ORG GOS  ] to closer cooperation on counter-terrorism investigations. ----------------------------- ISSUES BONO WILL LIKELY RAISE ----------------------------- [LOC Venezuela  ] --------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) While he hopes [LOC Venezuela  ] will not be the focus of your meeting with him , [PER Bono  ] will come prepared to discuss [LOC Spain  ] 's outreach to [LOC Venezuela  ] , including its planned sale of military ships and planes . 
[PER Bono  ] has told us the reason [LOC Spain  ] is selling the ships to [LOC Venezuela  ] is to save ailing state-owned shipyard [PER Izar  ] ( reftel ) . 
This is probably partly true -- it is also clear President [ORG Zapatero  ] believes he can influence [PER Chavez  ] and restrain his anti-democratic tendencies by engaging him . 
Nonetheless , [PER Bono  ] will point out that the sale amounts to USD 1.7 billion in equipment and will provide [PER Izar  ] with 600 jobs over a 4-5 year period . 
He will also insist that neither the ships nor the planes will have offensive capability , and that [PER Chavez  ] has agreed not to use the equipment for offensive purposes. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Embassy and other [ORG USG  ] officials have made clear many times to high-level [ORG GOS  ] officials ( including to President [ORG Zapatero  ] himself by Deputy Secretary of State [PER Zoellick  ] ) that the [LOC U.S.  ] believes the sale would bolster [MISC Chavez'  ] military capabilities and thus his capacity to cause instability in the region , and would also lend him political credibility when he is taking steps to curb democracy in his own country . 
In addition , we have told [MISC Spanish  ] officials that given that [MISC Spain-U.S.  ] relations were slowly improving , now was not the time to make a major military sale to [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
[ORG S-80 Submarine Program  ] ---------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG Navy  ] plans to procure 4 new diesel submarines of [MISC Spanish  ] design , called the [MISC S-80A  ] . 
[PER Izar  ] will be the prime contractor for the vessel 's construction . 
[PER Izar  ] has put out for competition a contract to assist in the building of the sub 's combat system . 
Two [MISC American  ] companies , [ORG Raytheon  ] and [ORG Lockheed Martin  ] , are competing with each other and against a [MISC French  ] and [MISC German  ] company for the $115 million deal . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] government has been mulling the competitors' submissions for nearly a year and has yet to reach a decision . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG Navy  ] has made clear its support for a [LOC U.S.  ] solution for the combat system , arguing a [LOC U.S.  ] system will provide critical interoperability with the [ORG U.S. Navy  ] . 
The [ORG Zapatero  ] government , however , has told us they have received significant pressure from the [MISC French  ] government to award the contract to the [MISC French  ] competitor . 
Embassy has advocated tirelessly on behalf of the [LOC U.S.  ] companies . 
[LOC Tomahawk Missile  ] ---------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Bono  ] has said that if the [LOC U.S.  ] government releases the [MISC Tomahawk  ] missile to [LOC Spain  ] , [LOC Spain  ] will purchase the missile . 
We understand the release of the missile has cleared a number of hurdles in [LOC Washington  ] . 
He may well express the [MISC Spanish  ] government 's interest in purchasing the [MISC Tomahawk  ] missile to you and his hope that the release will be approved. ------------------------------------- BACKGROUND: SOCIALISTS REMAIN POPULAR ------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) One year after taking over the presidency , President [ORG Zapatero  ] enjoys an approval rating of over 60 percent and , barring a major setback , is likely to remain in power for at least one term ( until 2008 ) . 
The Socialist Party ( [ORG PSOE  ] ) as a whole also gets much higher marks today than the [ORG PP  ] opposition . 
[ORG Zapatero  ] 's withdrawal of [MISC Spanish  ] troops from [LOC Iraq  ] was wildly popular with the [MISC Spanish  ] public and the social agenda he has pushed appeals to [LOC Spain  ] 's center-left electorate ( gay rights , curbing the power of the [MISC Catholic  ] Church , better relations with regional governments in [LOC Catalonia  ] and the [ORG Basque Region  ] ) further broadening the Socialists' appeal . 
[ORG Aznar  ] and the [ORG PP  ] , meanwhile , remain unapologetic for their handling of the 3/11 bombings and declined to sideline leaders discredited by their actions in the wake of the bombings , further eroding their public support . 
[ORG Zapatero  ] 's main internal challenge is an effort by the [ORG Basque Regional Government  ] ( comprised of moderate [MISC Basque  ] nationalists opposed to [ORG ETA  ] violence ) to increase its autonomy from [LOC Spain  ] 's central government . 
This is a potential powder keg since most other regions of [LOC Spain  ] strongly oppose increasing the [ORG Basque Region  ] 's already considerable independence , unless they too are given greater independence. ------------------------ RECENT POSITIVE GESTURES ------------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Since November 2004 , [MISC Spanish  ] officials at all levels have made clear their desire to restore strong bilateral ties , with the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] 's Director General for [ORG Foreign Policy  ] ( under secretary equivalent ) telling us bluntly , " We want back in . 
" In response , we 've told our [MISC Spanish  ] contacts that we are prepared to move forward on issues of bilateral importance and that unambiguous , positive steps by [LOC Spain  ] would be the best signal to the [ORG USG  ] that they too were ready to move forward . 
[LOC Spain  ] subsequently agreed to [ORG USG  ] requests that it lead a Provincial Reconstruction Team and a [ORG Forward Support Base  ] in western [LOC Afghanistan  ] as part of [ORG NATO  ] 's mission in that country , issued positive statements regarding the [LOC Iraq  ] elections , and contributed $20 million to the [LOC Iraq  ] elections fund . 
[LOC Spain  ] also continues to disburse $300 million in assistance to [LOC Iraq  ] pledged during the 2003 [LOC Iraq  ] Donors Conference in [LOC Madrid  ] , and has agreed to train [MISC Iraqi  ] security forces in [LOC Spain  ] . 
We fully expect Minister [PER Bono  ] to highlight these moves to you as evidence that [LOC Spain  ] has taken significant steps to demonstrate its interest in improving relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The [ORG USG  ] has welcomed these steps , while making clear that we remain troubled by mixed signals from [LOC Spain  ] , such as that sent by [LOC Spain  ] 's policy of engagement with [PER Hugo Chavez  ] . 
We also want [LOC Spain  ] to lift its caveats on the deployment of [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG NATO  ] officers to participate in [ORG NATO  ] missions , and lift the caveats on its national forces' actions in [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Some in the [MISC Spanish  ] government , including [PER Bono  ] , have expressed the belief that [LOC Spain  ] is getting little in return for these positive steps . 
[PER Bono  ] has said that at times it appears the [LOC U.S.  ] focuses only the on the problems in [MISC U.S.-Spain  ] relations , not the positives ( reftel ) . -------------------------------- COMMENT: SENDING A CLEAR MESSAGE -------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The [ORG USG  ] will not re-establish with the [ORG Zapatero  ] government the deep and close relationship we had with the [ORG Aznar  ] administration . 
Nonetheless , the [LOC U.S.  ] has key interests in [LOC Spain  ] we are working hard to promote and secure , not the least of which are continued access to [MISC Spanish  ] military bases ( including flight clearances ) and counterterrorism cooperation . 
[MISC Spanish  ] officials -- including [ORG Zapatero  ] and [PER Bono  ] -- have expressed surprise that their [LOC Venezuela  ] policy could derail recent improvements in [MISC U.S.-Spain  ] relations . 
This is despite that fact that this embassy and various [LOC U.S.  ] officials , including Deputy Secretary [PER Zoellick  ] , have told the [MISC Spanish  ] that engaging [PER SIPDIS Chavez  ] and selling him military hardware could hurt relations at this sensitive time . 
[PER Bono  ] and others have also said they feel that the [LOC U.S.  ] does not sufficiently recognize the positive steps [LOC Spain  ] has taken to improve relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] Your meeting with [PER Bono  ] can be an opportunity to make clear that while the [LOC U.S.  ] appreciates [LOC Spain  ] 's cooperation in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , the full access [LOC Spain  ] has granted [LOC U.S.  ] forces to its military bases , its continued monetary contributions to [LOC Iraq  ] reconstruction and other positive steps , the [LOC U.S.  ] remains concerned about [MISC Spanish  ] actions that negatively affect our interests , such as [ORG Zapatero  ] 's [LOC Venezuela  ] policy .
