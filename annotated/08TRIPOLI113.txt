( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: Recent legislation making it easier for plaintiffs in terrorism-related lawsuits to seize foreign government-owned assets to satisfy [LOC U.S.  ] court judgments has caused concern among [LOC U.S.  ] firms partnered with [MISC Libyan  ] companies ( especially in the energy sector ) , and provoked a sharply negative reaction from the [ORG GOL  ] . 
[LOC U.S.  ] companies are attempting to clarify and reduce their potential exposure under section 1083 of the 2008 [ORG National Defense Authorization Act  ] ( aka , " the [MISC Lautenberg Amendment  ] " ) . 
The [ORG Libyan National Oil Corporation  ] ( [ORG NOC  ] ) has informed [MISC American  ] oil companies that it is " their problem " to solve , and has begun requiring [LOC U.S.  ] and other companies to conduct all operations in non-dollar denominations . 
A senior [ORG MFA  ] official warned the [ORG CDA  ] that this law could set back [MISC US-Libyan  ] relations . 
The [ORG MFA  ] has pressed [MISC European  ] governments not to cooperate with [LOC U.S.  ] judicial efforts to attach [MISC Libyan  ] assets in [LOC Europe  ] under the law . 
End summary . 
OIL PRODUCING & OIL SERVICES COMPANIES AT GREATEST RISK <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC U.S.  ] companies participating in joint venture partnerships with [MISC Libyan  ] national oil companies assess themselves as being at greatest risk under section 1083 of the [ORG National Defense Authorization Act  ] . 
This list includes [LOC Occidental  ] , [ORG ConocoPhillips  ] , [ORG Marathon  ] and [ORG Amerada Hess  ] . 
These companies are involved in jointly developing [MISC Libyan  ] oilfields and in extracting and lifting crude oil . 
The three [LOC U.S.  ] partners in the [ORG Oasis Group  ] ( [ORG Marathon  ] , [ORG ConocoPhillips  ] and [ORG Amerada Hess  ] , who are partnered with [MISC Libyan  ] state firm [ORG Waha  ] ) pay $2 million/month to the [ORG GOL  ] in operating fees , and $100 million/month in taxes and royalties . 
Company reps assess that these payments -- as well as jointly-held facilities and equipment -- would be exposed to court-ordered attachment and seizure under section 1083 . 
[LOC U.S.  ] oil service companies , such as [ORG Halliburton  ] , may also be exposed , according to local company reps , and most service companies have frozen further expansion until the risks are clarified . 
Company reps have expressed concern to us that their [ORG GOL  ] partner companies would view any [LOC U.S.  ] court-ordered attachments of payments or equipment as a breach of contract , potentially leading to termination of their work in [LOC Libya  ] . 
3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC U.S.  ] companies engaged exclusively in the exploration ( as distinct from production ) , such as [ORG Chevron  ] and [ORG ExxonMobil  ] , assess themselves to be subject to less risk for the moment , since they make no regular payments to the [ORG GOL  ] that would be subject to attachment ( the signing bonuses agreed in connection with winning their Exploration and Production Sharing ( [ORG EPSA  ] ) agreements have already been paid to the [ORG GOL  ] , and day-to-day exploration work is contracted out to largely non-GOL entities ) . 
Nevertheless , company reps say that they are concerned about the longer-term impact of this legislation on their future plans in [LOC Libya  ] . 
[ORG NOC  ] REACTS SWIFTLY 4 ( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG National Oil Corporation  ] ( [ORG NOC  ] ) has instructed all international partner companies to cease conducting transactions in [LOC U.S.  ] dollars . 
[LOC U.S.  ] oil company contacts have privately told us that the [ORG NOC  ] 's intent was to reduce its exposure to [LOC U.S.  ] courts , since dollar transactions are routed through the [LOC U.S.  ] financial system . 
The edict has disrupted the payments system in the energy sector , which has traditionally used the dollar. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG NOC  ] 's chairman , [PER Shukri Ghanem  ] , informed [LOC U.S.  ] firms in late January that they were " on their own " to resolve the problems caused by the new legislation , hinting that the firms would suffer the consequences for any [LOC U.S.  ] court-ordered disruption of their operations in [LOC Libya  ] . 
[LOC U.S.  ] company reps have told us that they believe that the [ORG NOC  ] could find them in breach of their contractual obligations if [LOC U.S.  ] courts disrupt their monthly payment of operational fees to the [ORG NOC  ] . 
[ORG GOL  ] NOT PLEASED 6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Senior [ORG MFA  ] adviser [PER Abdelati Obeidi  ] told [ORG CDA  ] that the [ORG GOL  ] viewed the [ORG Act  ] as a potentially serious setback to [MISC US-Libyan  ] relations . 
He said the [ORG GOL  ] understood that the initiative had come from the [ORG Congress  ] , but did not understand why the [ORG Administration  ] failed to block it , or at least its application to [LOC Libya  ] , as it had done in the case of [LOC Iraq  ] . 
7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Separately , according to [MISC European  ] and ex-Soviet bloc diplomats in [LOC Tripoli  ] , the [ORG GOL  ] has pressed their governments not to cooperate with any [LOC U.S.  ] judicial efforts to attachment [MISC Libyan  ] [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000113 002.2 OF 002 assets in [LOC Europe  ] under the [ORG Act  ] . 
One [MISC European  ] diplomat expressed surprise at the sharp edge of the [MISC Libyan  ] demarche , noting that their [ORG GOL  ] interlocutor had threatened unspecified consequences for the country 's commercial interests in [LOC Libya  ] if the country facilitated seizure of [MISC Libyan  ] assets pursuant to [LOC U.S.  ] claims . 
8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Comment:  ] The enactment of section 1083 , together with the mid-January $6 billion [LOC U.S.  ] court judgment against [LOC Libya  ] in the [LOC UTA  ] airliner case , has caused deep concern among [LOC U.S.  ] energy companies operating in [LOC Libya  ] and consternation within the [ORG GOL  ] . 
The companies are analyzing their exposure ; the [ORG GOL  ] is misinterpreting these developments as deliberate slights or , in the words of [PER Obeidi  ] , " a return to the era of sanctions . 
" Both are waiting to see how section 1083 will be applied , hoping , of course , that it will not be .
