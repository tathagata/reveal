( C ) SUMMARY: [PER Romain Serman  ] , AF-advisor at the [MISC French  ] [ORG Presidency  ] , on March 10 reviewed Sarkozy’s February 28 visit to [LOC Chad  ] and discussed possible next steps . 
In [LOC Chad  ] , [PER Sarkozy  ] stressed to [PER Deby  ] the importance of determining the fate of the missing opposition leaders and to develop a meaningful political dialogue in [LOC Chad  ] , based on the August 13 , 2007 , agreement . 
In the short term , concerned countries should try to make it difficult politically for [LOC Sudan  ] to allow [MISC Chadian  ] rebels to mount a new offensive prior to the May/June beginning of the rainy season , which would allow [ORG EUFOR  ] and UNAMID to deploy in a peaceful environment . 
[PER Serman  ] said that the [MISC Zaghawa  ] rebels no longer seemed willing to fight [PER Deby  ] and might be willing to go over to his side ( one of the objectives of a renewed political dialogue ) ; only the [MISC Nouri/Gorane  ] faction seemed willing to fight , and had been fully resupplied by [LOC Sudan  ] . 
[LOC Sudan  ] should also be placed under increased scrutiny , which would help to discourage its support for another rebel offensive . 
The [MISC South Africans  ] told [PER Sarkozy  ] during his February 28-29 visit that they could play a role by sending a bilateral mission to [LOC Sudan  ] to persuade [LOC Khartoum  ] to avoid another round of fighting and could make [LOC Chad  ] and [LOC Sudan  ] priorities during [MISC South Africa’s  ] tenure as [ORG UNSC  ] president in April . 
Other possible leverage against [LOC Sudan  ] included a reference to potential [ORG International Criminal Court  ] interest and increased engagement by [LOC China  ] , which was beginning to see the threat [MISC Sudanese  ] regional adventurism could post to [MISC China’s  ] oil interests in [LOC Sudan  ] . 
[PER Serman  ] welcomed feedback from the [LOC U.S.  ] and other concerned parties . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Romain Serman  ] , one of the two working-level AF-advisors at the [MISC French  ] [ORG Presidency  ] , on March 10 met with acting AF-watcher and [ORG UK Embassy  ] [LOC Paris  ] AF-watcher [PER Lucy Joyce  ] to discuss President Sarkozy’s February 28 visit to [LOC Chad  ] and possible next steps on the [MISC Chad/Sudan/EUFOR  ] cluster of issues . 
( Ref A reports Serman’s comments on the death of the [ORG EUFOR  ] soldier in [LOC Sudan  ] ; septel will report his comments on [MISC France’s  ] evolving military and basing posture in [LOC Africa  ] , which [PER Sarkozy  ] announced in [LOC Cape Town  ] after his visit to [LOC Chad  ] . 
) Sarkozy’s Visit --------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) As reported Ref B , [PER Sarkozy  ] faced a skeptical media and [ORG NGO  ] community prior to the February 28 trip to [LOC Chad  ] , with criticism centered on [MISC France’s  ] support for [PER Deby  ] , who himself faced strong criticism on human rights and the fate of three missing opposition leaders . 
[PER Serman  ] reported that [PER Sarkozy  ] met with representatives of the press and [ORG NGOs  ] to exchange views before announcing his decision to make the February 28 stop in [LOC Chad  ] en route to [LOC South Africa  ] . 
[PER Serman  ] said that the press and [ORG NGOs  ] appreciated his willingness to discuss [LOC Chad  ] with them but that there was no perceptible shift in their views . 
Nonetheless , it was useful for [PER Sarkozy  ] to speak directly to his critics , [PER Serman  ] said , if for no other reason to provide them with the presidency’s political perspective , directly from the president . 
[PER Serman  ] reported that [PER Sarkozy  ] and other elements of the [ORG GOF  ] continued to be frustrated with [ORG Amnesty International  ] , which maintained that it possessed a document that allegedly showed that [LOC France  ] knew about , and even approved of , the detention of the oppositionists even before they disappeared . 
[ORG Amnesty International  ] refused to provide a copy of this purported document , [PER Serman  ] said , even when pressed to provide evidence for its assertions. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) According to [PER Serman  ] , [PER Sarkozy  ] had two priorities in [LOC Chad  ] -- first , to insist that the fate of missing political opponents be determined and to obtain [MISC Chadian  ] agreement that a commission of inquiry be established to address that issue . 
Second , [PER Sarkozy  ] wanted to urge [PER Deby  ] and [PER Chad’s  ] political class to commit to developing a meaningful dialogue , in accordance with the framework suggested in the August 13 , 2007 , agreement. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) On the oppositionists , [PER Serman  ] asserted that [MISC French  ] pressure yielded positive results , if only partial , citing the release of [PER Lol Mahamat Choua  ] , the subject of earlier [MISC French  ] entreaties , and the eventual reappearance of [PER Ngarlejy Yorongar  ] in [LOC Cameroon  ] ( who subsequently received asylum in [LOC France  ] ) . 
[PER Serman  ] added that the [ORG GOF  ] , while respecting [LOC PARIS  ] 00000461 002 OF 003 Yornogar’s status as a [PER Deby  ] opponent , did not put much stock in his political judgment or his position on most issues . 
[PER Serman  ] said that [LOC Chad  ] still had to account for [PER Ibni Oumar Mahamat Saleh  ] and to establish a credible commission of inquiry to determine in a transparent manner what had happened to [MISC Deby’s  ] political opponents during , and in the wake of , the rebel offensive early in February . 
[PER Serman  ] said that the [ORG GOF  ] had no concrete information on [PER Saleh  ] , although there were rumor-like indications that he was still alive . 
The [ORG GOC  ] had to rename the commission of inquiry ( its present title , along the lines of “Commission to Investigate [MISC Sudanese  ] Aggression in February 2008 , ” was unacceptable , if not ludicrous , in Serman’s view ) and to include a range of interested parties to supplement its pro-government members . 
Political Dialogue and Next Steps --------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Serman  ] stressed the importance of making progress on Sarkozy’s second priority of encouraging meaningful political dialogue in [LOC Chad  ] . 
[PER Serman  ] noted the key role the August 13 , 2007 , agreement could play . 
Acknowledging that the August 13 agreement “was not perfect , ” [PER Serman  ] said that it still could serve as a good point of departure -- “let’s not throw out the baby with the bath water , ” he stressed . 
Referring to comments he had made earlier ( Ref B ) , [PER Serman  ] said that the long-range goal of promoting political dialogue in [LOC Chad  ] and , hopefully , laying the groundwork for political reconciliation , would be to deprive the rebels of a reason to continue opposing the government and to entice the rebels into working with the government instead . 
[MISC France’s  ] demand that the government account for its treatment of opposition leaders was another signal to the rebels that [LOC France  ] was trying to influence the government into taking steps that would enable the rebels to stop the fighting. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) After discussing the facts of the [ORG EUFOR  ] soldier’s death ( ref A ) , [PER Serman  ] said that all concerned parties should work to see that [LOC Sudan  ] did not “escalate” tensions with [LOC Chad  ] . 
[PER Serman  ] believed that the killing of the [ORG EUFOR  ] soldier was a [MISC Sudanese  ] measure to test the [ORG EU’s  ] resolve with respect to EUFOR’s deployment . 
[PER Serman  ] said that the killing , so far , seemed to have no effect on the [ORG EU’s  ] willingness to deploy [ORG EUFOR  ] and to have it carry out its mandate to protect refugees in eastern [LOC Chad  ] and in the [LOC C.A.R.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Serman  ] said that steps should be taken to deter [MISC Sudanese  ] “escalation” with respect to [LOC Chad  ] because Bashir seemed ready to fight . 
However , in [MISC France’s  ] view , the [MISC Zaghawa  ] elements of the rebel forces no longer seemed willing to renew the fighting and might be willing to go over to [MISC Deby’s  ] side . 
Nouri’s faction ( ethnically Gorane ) remained committed to overthrowing [PER Deby  ] and had been fully resupplied by [LOC Khartoum  ] , [PER Serman  ] said. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) In the immediate term , the objective was to avoid another [MISC Sudan-backed  ] rebel offensive before the onset of the rainy season in May/June . 
This would allow [ORG EUFOR  ] , as well as [ORG UNAMID  ] , to deploy more fully . 
[PER Serman  ] suggested that the way to do this would be to make it difficult politically for [LOC Sudan  ] to allow another offensive to take place . 
This could be accomplished by dispatching multilateral missions ( which he did not specify in detail ) to [LOC Sudan  ] , “activating existing international fora” ( which he also did not specify in detail ) , and to increase general diplomatic “static.” He summarized by stating that [LOC Sudan  ] had to feel that it was under intense and continuing diplomatic scrutiny , which , he believed , would discourage [LOC Sudan  ] from pushing the rebels into launching a new offensive . 
This would allow [ORG EUFOR  ] to continue its deployment in a peaceful environment and its growing presence in [LOC Chad  ] and [LOC C.A.R.  ] , and the continued deployment of [ORG UNAMID  ] in [LOC Darfur  ] would serve to deter renewed fighting. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) When [PER Sarkozy  ] visited [LOC South Africa  ] after the stop in [LOC Chad  ] ( ref C ) , the [MISC South Africans  ] told him they could play an active and helpful role as well . 
The [MISC South Africans  ] said they might send a bilateral mission to [LOC Sudan  ] to advise against renewed fighting , and could make [LOC Chad  ] and [LOC Sudan  ] priorities during [MISC South Africa’s  ] presidency of the [ORG UNSC  ] in April. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Serman  ] mentioned that other signals could be sent to [LOC Sudan  ] , including subtle reminders of possible [ORG International Criminal Court  ] interest in [LOC Sudan  ] . 
[PER Serman  ] noted that “we know the [LOC U.S.  ] has strong reservations about the [ORG ICC  ] , [LOC PARIS  ] 00000461 003 OF 003 but we think the specter of [ORG ICC  ] involvement could serve as an additional lever to discourage [LOC Sudan  ] from backing a new rebel offensive . 
Those who do not share your reservations could send a signal to [PER Khartoum.” Serman  ] said that the [ORG GOF  ] believed that [LOC Sudan  ] was extremely sensitive about the [ORG ICC  ] and thus subject to a signal along the lines he mentioned . 
[PER Serman  ] said that the [MISC French  ] had been talking to [LOC China  ] , which was slowly becoming aware of its own stake in the issue , aside from the criticism it had been receiving . 
[PER Serman  ] noted the growing [MISC Chinese  ] concern about possible [MISC North-South  ] fissures in [LOC Sudan  ] and the possibility that its oil interests could be threatened should there be a some sort of more permanent [MISC North-South  ] break . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] were beginning to see more clearly that Sudan’s behavior towards [LOC Darfur  ] and [LOC Chad  ] could only increase the possibility of a [MISC North-South  ] rupture with a possibly severe effect on China’s stake in the oil sector. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) In conclusion , [PER Serman  ] summarized [MISC French  ] priorities -- increased political dialogue within [LOC Chad  ] , including resolution of the controversy over [ORG GOC  ] treatment of opposition leaders , which could lead to reconciliation with [MISC Zaghawa  ] rebel elements ; increased engagement by the international community , including [LOC South Africa  ] and [LOC China  ] , to encourage [LOC Sudan  ] from backing another rebel offensive , which would allow deployment of [ORG EUFOR  ] and [ORG UNAMID  ] before the beginning of the rainy season in May/June ; and the use of tools such as the [ORG ICC  ] to discourage Khartoum’s regional adventurism . 
[PER Serman  ] said that the [ORG GOF  ] would welcome dialogue with the [LOC U.S.  ] and other international partners on how best to reduce the possibility of further [MISC Chad-Sudan  ] conflict via their rebel proxies .
