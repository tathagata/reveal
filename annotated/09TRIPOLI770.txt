REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Summary:  ] The [MISC Canadian  ] Ambassador to [LOC Libya  ] confirmed September 28 that the [MISC Libyan  ] Government had canceled [MISC Libyan  ] Leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] 's planned stop in [LOC Newfoundland  ] in protest of the [MISC Canadian  ] Foreign Minister 's statement that he would give [PER Qadhafi  ] a " public tongue-lashing " regarding the hero 's welcome given [MISC Pan Am 103  ] bomber [PER Abdel Bassett  ] al-Megrahi . 
The contretemps is escalating into a commercial dispute , as the [ORG National Oil Company  ] called in the Chairman of [ORG PetroCanada  ] September 27 with a threat to nationalize the company 's operations in [LOC Libya  ] if the [MISC Canadian  ] Government did not offer a formal apology . 
Post recommends supporting the [MISC Canadian  ] Embassy if a request is made to intervene with the [MISC Libyans  ] on [ORG Petrocanada  ] 's behalf . 
End Summary . 
2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Canadian  ] Ambassador to [LOC Libya  ] [PER Sandra McArdle  ] called the Ambassador September 28 to inform him of the escalating contretemps between the [MISC Canadian  ] and [MISC Libyan  ] governments engendered by [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi 's proposed September 29-30 stopover in [LOC Newfoundland  ] en route to [LOC Seville  ] , [LOC Spain  ] . 
[PER McArdle  ] told us that [LOC Canada  ] 's minority government , facing tough elections , had initially planned to cancel [PER Qadhafi  ] 's one-day stopover in [LOC Newfoundland  ] . 
On instructions from [LOC Ottawa  ] , [PER McArdle  ] said that she informed the [MISC Libyan  ] Government in mid-September that [PER Qadhafi  ] was not welcome to visit [LOC Canada  ] at this time . 
[PER McArdle  ] , who had just arrived in [LOC Libya  ] in late August , had not yet presented her credentials at that time and said that she seriously believed for a few days that she could be PNG'ed or have her agrement revoked . 
3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Fearful of delivering bad news to [PER Qadhafi  ] , [PER McArdle  ] explained that the notoriously slow [MISC Libyan  ] bureaucracy , delayed passing [LOC Ottawa  ] 's message to the Leader for several days . 
In the meantime , [MISC Canadian  ] companies with business interests in [LOC Libya  ] launched a furious lobbying effort and convinced [LOC Ottawa  ] to allow the trip to go forward . 
However , [PER McArdle  ] said that the [MISC Canadian  ] Government 's precarious domestic situation and upcoming elections pressed the Foreign Minister to go public with his very stern message . 
As of September 26 , [PER McArdle  ] said that she had not yet received any reaction from the [MISC Libyan  ] Government regarding her Foreign Minister 's statement , although she expected it would not be well-received . 
LOGISTICAL DETAILS COMPLICATE [MISC LIBYAN  ] STOPOVER REQUEST 4 . 
( C/NF ) [PER McArdle  ] added that the last-minute nature of the trip had posed serious logistical challenges . 
The [MISC Canadian  ] Government was forced to issue last-minute visas for [PER Qadhafi  ] 's 130 delegation members at its consulate in [LOC New York  ] . 
She hinted that the [MISC Canadian  ] Government had waived many of its visa requirements and security checks , relying instead on the fact that [PER Qadhafi  ] and his party had undergone extensive [LOC U.S.  ] vetting in order to receive their [ORG UNGA  ] visas , but later told the Ambassador that the [MISC Libyans  ] appeared to have been offended by [LOC Canada  ] 's visa requirements and procedures . 
GOL DEMANDS APOLOGY , THREATENS TO NATIONALIZE [ORG PETROCANADA  ] 5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) On September 27 , the [MISC Libyans  ] responded strongly to the perceived [MISC Canadian  ] snub of [PER Qadhafi  ] . 
The [ORG National Oil Corporation  ] called in the head of [ORG PetroCanada  ] abruptly September 27 , threatening to nationalize the company if the Government of [LOC Canada  ] did not offer a formal apology to [PER Qadhafi  ] for the [MISC Canadian  ] [ORG FM  ] 's statement . 
The [MISC Libyans  ] set a deadline of September 28 , which [PER McArdle  ] told the Ambassador would be difficult to meet given that offices in [LOC Ottawa  ] would open near close of business [LOC Tripoli  ] time and after the [MISC Canadian  ] weekend . 
6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER McArdle  ] said she has advocated some kind of public and private statements from the [MISC Canadian  ] PM and [ORG FM  ] , which would indicate a [MISC Canadian  ] welcome for the [MISC Libyans  ] and hopefully turn the situation around . 
[MISC Libyans  ] here are frantically calling the [MISC Canadian  ] Embassy , concerned that if the issue is not resolved , [PER Qadhafi  ] 's trip home will be complicated by lack of a place to stop for necessary refueling . 
[LOC UK  ] EMBASSY REQUESTS GUIDANCE ON INTERVENTION IN SUPPORT OF [ORG PETROCANADA  ] 7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC British  ] Ambassador Sir [PER Vincent Fein  ] requested to meet the Ambassador on short notice September 28 to say he had queried [LOC London  ] to see if the [ORG FCO  ] wanted any intervention on the [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000770 002.2 OF 002 basis of concern over commercial interests ( i.e. , that the [MISC Libyans  ] should not be doing this type of retaliation as it will spook all investors . 
The action will heighten concern given that the oil and gas sector has been traditionally protected from whim , except of course when it came to seeking contributions for the compensation fund and the difficult contract negotiations that the [MISC Libyans  ] are engaging in with the oil companies ) . 
The Ambassador told [PER Fein  ] that he would see if there was any similar interest in [LOC Washington  ] to intervene on [ORG Petrocanada  ] 's behalf . 
8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Comment: Post believes it would be in the [ORG USG  ] 's interest to weigh in on the same basis as the [MISC British  ] may decide to do: namely , to emphasize that it is not good for [LOC Libya  ] to threaten existing and potential investors and violate the sanctity of contracts with such abandon . 
The situation between the [MISC Libyans  ] and [MISC Canadians  ] reflects vintage [MISC Libyan  ] policy to strike hard at any quarter that insults the Leader publicly . 
The issue may be a bit more complicated by the fact that [ORG Petrocanada  ] 's new owner , Suncorps , was reportedly trying to divest itself of [MISC Libyan  ] assets anyway ( septel ) .
