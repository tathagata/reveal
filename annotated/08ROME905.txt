( [ORG U  ] ) Summary: The Director of [ORG Italy’s Sub-Saharan African Assistance Office  ] said assistance levels are not expected to change with the newly installed [MISC Berlusconi  ] government . 
[LOC Italy  ] will continue to focus its funding on [LOC Ethiopia  ] and [LOC Mozambique  ] , with an emphasis on health and education . 
Development officials hope assistance issues will continue to be a priority for [LOC Italy  ] during its 2009 [MISC G-8  ] presidency . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) On June 19 Econoff met with [PER Fabrizio Nava  ] , Director of the [ORG Office of Sub-Saharan Africa Assistance  ] , to discuss [ORG GOI  ] assistance to [LOC Africa  ] . 
The 2008 [ORG GOI  ] budget allocates 4.1 billion [PER Euros  ] for foreign assistance , or .27 percent of GDP , slightly above the percentage of GDP in 2007 . 
The [ORG MFA  ] disperses roughly 750 million of the 4.1 billion [PER Euros  ] through the foreign aid office ; [LOC Africa  ] receives around 140 to 200 million for bilateral and multilateral humanitarian assistance . 
The [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] controls the remaining foreign assistance account which covers [ORG Italy’s  ] contributions to the [ORG United Nations  ] , [ORG EU  ] , [ORG World Bank  ] and [ORG Italy’s  ] debt-forgiveness program . 
Despite the recent arrival of the center-right government and budget cuts , [PER Nava  ] believed [MISC African  ] assistance levels would be maintained. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [LOC Italy  ] supplies aid to 36 of the countries in [LOC Africa  ] . 
Of these 36 , the [ORG GOI  ] gives three countries priority: [LOC Ethiopia  ] , [LOC Mozambique  ] , and [LOC Eritrea  ] . 
[LOC Eritrea  ] is now , however , only given emergency aid due to [ORG EU  ] restrictions . 
[PER Nava  ] said that the [ORG GOI  ] recently initiated a pilot program focused on budget support to [LOC Mozambique  ] . 
Should [ORG GOI  ] deem the program a success , [PER Nava  ] said similar budget support will be given to other [MISC African  ] countries starting with [LOC Cape Verde.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) According to [PER Nava  ] , [LOC Sudan  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] , and [LOC Mauritania  ] are lower priorities , but also receive assistance from the [ORG GOI  ] . 
[PER Nava  ] pointed to a recent memorandum of understanding pledging 12 million [PER Euros  ] over the next three years to [LOC Mauritania  ] . 
The funds have been earmarked for poverty alleviation , the improvement of living conditions , cultural programs and training for judges . 
( Note: [LOC Mauritania  ] is a personal concern of [PER Alain Economides  ] , Head of Minister [ORG Frattini’s Private Office  ] and former Ambassador to the region . 
End Note . 
) In [LOC Mauritania  ] and [LOC Egypt  ] , [PER Nava  ] noted that most [ORG GOI  ] aid focuses on agricultural , medical , and educational development . 
[PER Nava  ] expects work on gender issues , an initiative started by the previous Foreign Minister , to continue to be a priority as well , although he did not provide specifics. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Econoff brought up criticism voiced by [PER NGOs  ] such as Bono’s “Debt [ORG AIDS Trade Africa”  ] ( [ORG D.A.T.A  ] . 
) and [ORG Action Aid Italy  ] that [ORG Italy’s  ] aid apparatus is out-of-date and overly focused on infrastructure projects . 
[PER Nava  ] explained that donating to [PER NGOs  ] is rather difficult due to the small number of them ; there are roughly 300 “recognized” [PER NGOs  ] in [LOC Italy  ] . 
In order to be recognized by the [ORG GOI  ] , [PER NGOs  ] must go through a three-year vetting process . 
[PER Nava  ] observed that over the past two years , the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] has made improvements in disbursing assistance through [PER NGOs  ] and said he believed the trend would continue . 
In closing , [PER Nava  ] said he expected [MISC African  ] assistance be a focus during [ORG Italy’s  ] 2009 [MISC G-8  ] presidency. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Comment: With its 2009 G8 presidency looming , the [ORG GOI  ] may decide to maintain funding levels simply to avoid an embarrassing tongue-lashing from [PER Bono  ] et al . 
End comment .
