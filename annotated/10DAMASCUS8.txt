( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: In a frank one-hour meeting with [MISC Syrian  ] President [PER Bashar al-Asad  ] , [PER Senators Gregg  ] , [PER Bayh  ] , [PER Specter  ] , [PER Enzi  ] , [PER Cornyn  ] , and [MISC Klobuchar  ] affirmed [LOC Washington  ] 's interest in better [MISC U.S.-Syrian  ] relations and pushed [PER Asad  ] to take positive steps as well . 
The senators urged [LOC Syria  ] to move forward on security cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] on [LOC Iraq  ] , facilitating the release of three detained [MISC Americans  ] in [LOC Iran  ] , and re-opening the [ORG Damascus Community School  ] . 
[PER Asad  ] welcomed the prospect of more [ORG Congressional  ] visits and candid exchanges , saying diplomacy had failed to solve the region 's problems during the last two decades . 
-- On comprehensive peace , [PER Asad  ] reiterated [LOC Syria  ] 's strong desire to return to [MISC Turkish-facilitated  ] indirect talks with [LOC Israel  ] as a means to establish agreed terms of reference for direct negotiations . 
[LOC Syria  ] 's relations with [LOC Iran  ] should not be linked to [MISC Israeli-Syrian  ] peace negotiations . 
[LOC Syria  ] 's ties to [ORG Hamas  ] , [ORG Hizballah  ] , and other groups could be satisfactorily resolved only after the achievement of a comprehensive regional peace , [PER Asad  ] maintained . 
-- The [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Syria  ] should use the next several months to improve bilateral relations so that both sides could overcome mutual distrust that would hinder [LOC U.S.  ] credibility as an honest broker , [PER Asad  ] told the senators . 
Later in the discussion , FM Muallim argued the onus for taking the next positive step lay with the [LOC U.S.  ] [LOC Syria  ] could not move on issues such as the [MISC American  ] school or the [ORG Cultural Center  ] unless [LOC Washington  ] lifted its ban on the sale of new commercial aircraft to [LOC Syria  ] . 
-- Calling [LOC Iran  ] the region 's most important country , [PER Asad  ] said the [LOC West  ] could improve the prospects for peace by acknowledging [LOC Iran  ] 's NPT-protected right to enrich uranium under [ORG IAEA  ] monitoring . 
[PER Asad  ] argued the [MISC West  ] should accept [LOC Iran  ] 's " reasonable " counter-offer to ship several batches of low-enriched uranium ( [ORG LEU  ] ) abroad for enrichment by other countries , instead of insisting [LOC Iran  ] ship all of its [ORG LEU  ] at once . 
[PER Asad  ] said he believed [LOC Iran  ] was not interested in pursuing a nuclear weapon , but warned that an [MISC Israeli  ] military strike on [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear infrastructure would fail to disable the program and would only increase [LOC Iran  ] 's determination . 
End Summary. --------------------------------------------- -- Doctor [PER Asad: Treat  ] , Don't Condemn , the Illness --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) A confident President [PER Asad  ] greeted the six visiting senators and accompanying staff of CODEL [PER Gregg  ] on December 30 with a call for frank discussion of " the facts " rather than an exchange of opinions . 
Only the facts , he said , would enable both sides to focus on the critical issues of common interest and lead to a process of identifying solutions to shared challenges . 
The international community had failed for two decades to solve the region 's problems . 
Now , there were new challenges on top of these that required direct , not diplomatic , solutions . 
He welcomed the delegation , saying he hoped for more meetings with [ORG Congressional  ] groups. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Senator [PER Specter  ] expressed the delegation 's condolences after the death of the President 's younger brother Majd and recalled his numerous meetings with President [PER Asad  ] since their first meeting in 2000 at the funeral of former [MISC Syrian  ] President [PER Hafez al-Asad  ] . 
Senator [PER Specter  ] referred to his earlier discussions with [MISC Syrian  ] officials about [MISC Israeli-Syrian  ] peace talks and suggested [ORG DAMASCUS  ] 00000008 002 OF 006 [LOC Israel  ] would benefit from peace with [LOC Syria  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] recognized [LOC Syria  ] 's deep and long-standing ties to [LOC Iran  ] , but it also saw dangers if [LOC Iran  ] acquired nuclear weapons . 
Stipulating that the [MISC Israeli  ] government would have to make its own decisions on how to proceed in peace talks with [LOC Syria  ] without [LOC U.S.  ] pressure , [PER Specter  ] suggested the [LOC U.S.  ] would positively view [MISC Syrian  ] efforts to use its influence to alter [MISC Iranian  ] policies . 
[MISC Iranian  ] policies currently opposed the achievement of peace between [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Israel  ] , even as [LOC Syria  ] recognized such a development would have a positive impact on defusing other regional tensions. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Asad  ] asserted he wanted peace with [LOC Israel  ] , but the issues were complex and required an organized frame of reference . 
Both sides might agree on the shared objective of peace , but they differed on preferred approaches . 
Calling for a fact-based approach to identifying the obstacles to peace , [PER Asad  ] likened the process to how a doctor should treat cancer . 
Condemnations and mutual recriminations might be self-satisfying , but the cancer still grows unless the doctor is able to treat the root illness . 
[LOC Syria  ] , [PER Asad  ] continued , had begun indirect peace talks with [LOC Israel  ] in May 2008 under [MISC Turkish  ] auspices . 
In roughly eight months , these talks had achieved more than several years of direct negotiations with [LOC Israel  ] in the 1990s . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Europeans  ] needed to support the [MISC Turkish  ] track , argued [PER Asad  ] . 
They also should convince [LOC Israel  ] that only peace will protect [LOC Israel  ] . 
[LOC Israel  ] 's military superiority would not secure it from attack against missiles and other technologies . 
President [PER Obama  ] 's tenure might represent the last opportunity for peace , [PER Asad  ] told the senators. ----------------------------------------- [PER Asad  ] on Necessity of Indirect Peace Talks ----------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Senator [PER Gregg  ] asked why [LOC Syria  ] insisted on pursuing indirect peace talks via the [LOC Turks  ] . 
Why couldn't [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Israel  ] move to direct talks brokered by the [LOC U.S.  ] , while [LOC Syria  ] helped on issues important to the [LOC U.S.  ] , such as [ORG Hizballah  ] , [ORG Hamas  ] , and relations with [LOC Iran  ] ? 
[PER Asad  ] replied [ORG Hamas  ] and [ORG Hizballah  ] should be a part of the peace , but not organizing principles for conducting peace discussions . 
[LOC Syria  ] , as demonstrated by then-lead negotiator Muallim 's efforts in the 1990s , had no problems with direct negotiations . 
But those negotiations failed ; failing again might foreclose future opportunities . 
[LOC U.S.  ] ambitions to push the peace process forward only resulted in spoiling the process because of the lack of " rules of negotiation . 
" Indirect talks represent the best way to establish terms of reference similar to those reached by Secretary Baker during his intense shuttle diplomacy in 1991 . 
While no one called these talks indirect negotiations , they functioned comparably to [LOC Syria  ] 's indirect talks under [MISC Turkish  ] auspices. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [LOC Syria  ] , [PER Asad  ] continued , saw the indirect talks as a way to institutionalize the process and reach agreed terms of reference on which to base direct negotiations . 
This basis was absent in the 1990s and explained why the direct negotiations ultimately failed . 
Referring to the " elephant in the room , " [PER Gregg  ] asked whether it would be possible to reach peace with [LOC Israel  ] without first resolving the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear issue . 
[PER Asad  ] cautioned against linking [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program to an [MISC Israeli-Syrian  ] peace deal , arguing such a link would only complicate both sets of issues . 
" Too many cooks spoil the meal , " he said . 
Later in the conversation , however ( in the context of a request for [MISC Syrian  ] intervention with [LOC Iran  ] to free detained [MISC American  ] hikers ) , [PER Asad  ] noted every person and nation was key in bilateral and regional dynamics . 
[ORG DAMASCUS  ] 00000008 003 OF 006 [LOC Syria  ] had cut relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] after the 1967 [MISC Arab-Israeli  ] conflict , but bilateral relations had improved markedly after President [PER Nixon  ] visited [LOC Syria  ] in 1974 to discuss peace with [LOC Israel  ] . 
" That 's our issue , " he stressed , noting that the [LOC Golan  ] track had been active under President [PER Carter  ] but then dormant through most of the 1980s and the early part of the current decade. --------------------------------------------- --------- [ORG Iraq: Political Cooperation  ] , [ORG Then Security Cooperation  ] --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Senator [PER Bayh  ] observed that many things in [LOC Syria  ] had changed for the better since his 2002 visit . 
Now , there were positive indicators that bilateral relations might be on the upswing as well . 
One area , however , in which relations had not improved was intelligence cooperation . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Syria  ] appeared to have common interests in seeing a stable [LOC Iraq  ] , not dominated by [LOC Iran  ] . 
Yet , foreign extremists continued to travel through [LOC Syria  ] into [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] had provided information regarding four named individuals to the [MISC Syrian  ] government , but nothing had happened . 
Perhaps now was a propitious moment to consider re-establishing intelligence ties , [PER Bayh  ] suggested . 
[PER Asad  ] concurred with the idea of overlapping [MISC U.S.-Syrian  ] interests in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
He noted , however , that the main obstacle to increased [MISC U.S.-Syrian  ] security cooperation stemmed from the absence of political cooperation . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] possessed a " huge information apparatus " but lacked the ability to analyze this information successfully , maintained [PER Asad  ] . 
" You're failing in the fight against extremism . 
While we lack your intelligence capabilities , we succeed in fighting extremists because we have better analysts , " he claimed , attributing the superior analysis to living in and understanding the region. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [LOC Syria  ] , [PER Asad  ] explained , had refused to cooperate with President [ORG Bush  ] because it did not trust him and because the [ORG Bush Administration  ] had wrongfully accused [LOC Syria  ] of supporting foreign fighters . 
When President [PER Obama  ] assumed office , [LOC Syria  ] tried to be positive . 
[PER Asad  ] he had proposed to Special [PER Envoy Mitchell  ] the idea of a border security cooperation initiative with [LOC Iraq  ] as a first step . 
( Post Comment: [PER Asad  ] 's recollection is both selective and inaccurate . 
[LOC U.S.  ] officials first proposed a border security cooperation initiative to a reluctant FM Muallim in May 2009 . 
President [PER Asad  ] agreed to participate after meeting [PER S/E Mitchell  ] in late July 2009 . 
) " This was a small step for me , but big for you , " [PER Asad  ] argued . 
Citing the [LOC U.S.  ] inability to control its long border with [LOC Mexico  ] , [PER Asad  ] said the border was not the major challenge . 
[LOC Syria  ] 's close intelligence cooperation with [LOC Turkey  ] enabled both countries to prevent terrorists from crossing their 860-kilometer border without relying on a huge border security presence . 
This intelligence cooperation enabled [LOC Syria  ] to " suffocate " logistical networks critical to the movement of terrorists . 
" In the [LOC U.S.  ] , you like to shoot ( terrorists ) . 
Suffocating their networks is far more effective , " said [ORG Asad.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Asad  ] said [LOC Syria  ] required a positive first step prior to resuming intelligence cooperation , a position that Senator [PER Mitchell  ] had accepted . 
[LOC Syria  ] had succeeded in convincing [MISC Iraqi  ] PM Maliki on August 18 to reverse its opposition to the trilateral border security initiative and was ready to participate . 
After the August 19 bombings and [MISC Iraqi  ] accusations against [LOC Syria  ] for facilitating the terrorist attacks , [LOC Syria  ] remained willing to participate in the border assessments . 
It was the [LOC U.S.  ] , [PER Asad  ] insisted , that had backed away . 
[LOC Syria  ] had no interest in supporting extremists , who weren't killing [MISC Americans  ] but rather [MISC Iraqi  ] civilians . 
" That [ORG DAMASCUS  ] 00000008 004 OF 006 hurts us , " [PER Asad  ] claimed . 
[LOC U.S  ] . 
" mistakes in [LOC Iraq  ] " had cost [LOC Syria  ] and the region a great deal . 
[LOC Syria  ] had out of self-interest sought to deter terrorists who popped up . 
Still , despite a shared interest with the [LOC U.S.  ] in ensuring [MISC Iraqi  ] stability , [LOC Syria  ] would not immediately jump to intelligence cooperation without ensuring its own interests would be respected . 
" I won't give it ( intelligence cooperation ) to you for free , " he said . 
Senator [PER Bayh  ] replied that the [LOC U.S.  ] was working to normalize relations and considering positive steps to take along the way . 
[LOC Syria  ] , [PER Asad  ] commented , had been clear on how to start rebuilding relations . 
" We didn't say no , " he said , " but we have to build from an absence of trust . 
" ---------------------------------------- [ORG Asad: Door Open  ] to [MISC Iranian  ] Nuclear Deal ---------------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Senator [PER Cornyn  ] commented the most dire threat to regional peace stemmed from [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear aspirations . 
[MISC Syrian  ] interests could well suffer if there were a conflict between [LOC Israel  ] and [LOC Iran  ] and possibly others . 
[PER Asad  ] replied no one could predict the course of a conflict ; therefore , it was better to avoid one . 
The [ORG Bush Administration  ] took a political approach to [LOC Iran  ] instead of dealing with the nuclear issue in the context of the [ORG Non-Proliferation Treaty  ] . 
Under the [LOC NPT  ] , [LOC Iran  ] enjoys the right to enrich uranium , provided there is [ORG IAEA  ] monitoring . 
Instead of trying to stop [LOC Iran  ] 's program , the international emphasis should shift to ensuring proper monitoring . 
[LOC Iran  ] had accepted the principle of enriching uranium outside of its borders . 
Now the challenge was how to meet [LOC Iran  ] 's concern that shipping all of its LEU at once would risk not receiving any in return . 
[PER Asad  ] claimed [LOC Iran  ] sought only to enrich its uranium to 20 percent , well bellow the 95 percent threshold necessary for weapons-grade material . 
If the international community agreed to divide [LOC Iran  ] 's shipments into four or five parts , [LOC Iran  ] would be flexible , [PER Asad  ] argued . 
In the meantime , [LOC Israel  ] had to forget about attacking [LOC Iran  ] . 
Such a move would only encourage [LOC Iran  ] to follow the path of [LOC India  ] , [LOC Pakistan  ] , and others in seeking a nuclear weapon . 
[LOC Syria  ] opposed this outcome , but viewed the only solution was to recognize [LOC Iran  ] 's rights and demonstrate flexibility in foreign enrichment , [PER Asad  ] said. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Later in the conversation , Senator [PER Specter  ] argued [LOC Iran  ] appeared to be blocking a deal . 
[PER Asad  ] claimed [MISC Iranian  ] diplomacy was now more flexible because the government was stronger and more confident after the 2009 elections . 
Noting he had shared this assessment with [MISC French  ] President [PER Sarkozy  ] , [PER Asad  ] said he judged [LOC Iran  ] to be looking for cooperative signs . 
[LOC Iran  ] represented the most important country in the region , [PER Asad  ] assessed , ranking [LOC Turkey  ] second and [LOC Syria  ] third . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] had troops in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and needed better relations with [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Specter  ] agreed the enrichment issue could be solved ; [LOC Russia  ] had offered to enrich [MISC Iranian  ] uranium several years ago , subject to international monitoring . 
[LOC Iran  ] had answered yes , replied [PER Asad  ] , but the issue was how to proceed . 
[LOC Iran  ] 's desire to divide the uranium shipments represented the only difference: if the [LOC West  ] agreed , the issue would be solved . 
There was an open door ; if the nuclear issue could be solved , the peace process would proceed more easily . 
But if conflict erupted , the regional context would become extremely complicated. ------------------------------------ Discussion of Detained Amcits in [LOC Iran  ] ------------------------------------- [ORG DAMASCUS  ] 00000008 005 OF 006 <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Senator [PER Klobuchar  ] commented that she had supported [PER Barak Obama  ] because of his promise to advance a new approach to international relations . 
While there were no easy solutions in the region , the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Syria  ] appeared to have overlapping interests in avoiding war and in ensuring a strong and stable [LOC Iraq  ] . 
From the [LOC U.S.  ] perspective , [LOC Syria  ] might demonstrate as a goodwill gesture its interest in better relations by helping obtain the release of three [MISC American  ] citizens -- [PER Joshua Fattal  ] , [PER Shane Bauer  ] and [PER Sarah Shourd  ] -- who apparrently crossed into [LOC Iran  ] while hiking in northeastern [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[MISC Swiss  ] officials had visited them , but they were isolated and the [LOC U.S.  ] lacked information on their whereabouts and any pending charges. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Asad  ] replied he was unfamiliar with their case and requested that the [MISC Embassy  ] send more information . 
Senator [PER Specter  ] interjected later in the conversation that the [MISC Embassy  ] had delivered a letter to the MFA that week from the Secretary . 
[PER Specter  ] added he had personally raised the matter in [LOC Washington  ] with [MISC Syrian  ] Ambassador [PER Imad Mustafa  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] would view positively [MISC Syrian  ] efforts to secure the three [MISC Americans'  ] release , [PER Specter  ] said , comparing the case to the [MISC Iranian  ] detention of [LOC UK  ] sailors whom [LOC Syria  ] helped to free . 
" We'll try our best , " replied [PER Asad  ] , saying it would be necessary to ask about the legal aspects of the case . 
[PER Specter  ] clarified there had been no charges filed . 
It had started as a trespassing case , but [MISC U.S.-Iranian  ] relations were so poor it was impossible to resolve. --------------------------------------------- --- Re-Opening DCS: [LOC Syria  ] Awaiting [ORG U.S. Steps First  ] --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Senator [PER Klobuchar  ] and Senator [PER Enzi  ] argued [LOC Syria  ] might demonstrate good will by re-opening the [ORG Damascus Community School  ] ( [ORG DCS  ] ) , whose closure had hurt not just [MISC American  ] students , but also many foreigners and [MISC Syrians  ] . 
Senator [PER Enzi  ] said his committee 's purview on education created a personal interest in seeing the [ORG DCS  ] re-opened ; the school 's closure represented a step away from moving towards positive relations . 
[PER Asad  ] replied he wanted to open [LOC Syria  ] to the rest of the world . 
In September 2008 , for example , the [MISC French  ] [ORG Embassy  ] opened a new international school . 
[PER Asad  ] explained he had ordered [ORG DCS  ] 's closure after a [LOC U.S.  ] military attack on [MISC Syrian  ] soil had killed seven innocent civilians in late October 2008 . 
" We had to respond , " he argued , saying the school 's closure " was the only step we could take " in response to the [ORG Bush Administration  ] . 
President [PER Carter  ] , [PER Asad  ] continued , had urged the reopening of [ORG DCS  ] during his December 2008 visit . 
" I told [PER Carter  ] that we are ready , " said [PER Asad  ] , who noted the [MISC Syrian  ] government wanted to send positive signals to the [PER Obama  ] administration and had done so by re-opening the [ORG American Cultural Center  ] ( [ORG ACC  ] ) . <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) FM Muallim noted that only part of the [ORG American Language Center  ] portion of [ORG ACC  ] had been allowed to re-open . 
He argued that he and other [MISC Syrian  ] officials had told [ORG State Department  ] officials that steps by [LOC Syria  ] to improve relations first required [LOC U.S.  ] steps . 
" We can't move without a waiver for [MISC Syrian  ] Airlines , " he argued , citing the threat to [MISC Syrian  ] civilians posed a [LOC U.S.  ] ban on the sale of civilian aircraft and spare parts . 
[PER Asad  ] noted that a good friend who ran a medical laboratory was similarly unable to import [LOC U.S.  ] lab technology . 
The bigger issue , [PER Asad  ] said , was about bilateral relations . 
[LOC Syria  ] 's intent was to re-open the [ORG DCS  ] . 
[PER Asad  ] said he trusted President [PER Carter  ] and supported President [PER Obama  ] . 
" We know he has other problems and priorities , but there must be [LOC U.S.  ] steps , " [PER Asad  ] insisted .
