END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) OVER LUNCH JUNE 7 , THE MFAS DAS-EQUIVALENT FOR THE PERSIAN GULF , FRANCK GELLET , SHARED HIS VIEWS ON [LOC IRAN  ] AND [LOC IRAQ  ] . 
HAVING RECENTLY RETURNED FROM A 15-DAY TRIP TO [LOC IRAN  ] , GELLET SAID THAT HIS MOST SERIOUS AND USEFUL INTERLOCUTOR WAS FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER VELAYATI , WHOM HE DESCRIBED AS BEING " LESS ROMANTIC " THAN THE REGIME'S OTHER FOREIGN POLICY HEAVYWEIGHTS . 
GELLET SAID THAT VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE IRANIAN OFFICIALS HE MET OVERESTIMATED THE REGIME'S STRENGTH , BOTH ON THE REGIONAL AND THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE . 
" THE IRANIANS ARE CONVINCED THAT NO ONE -- INCLUDING THE [LOC UNITED STATES  ] -- CAN TOUCH THEM ECONOMICALLY OR MILITARILY . 
THEY SIMPLY CAN'T IMAGINE THAT THE [LOC U.S.  ] HAS THE CAPACITY AND THE POLITICAL WILL TO LAUNCH A MILITARY STRIKE AGAINST THEM AT A TIME WHEN THE [LOC U.S.  ] MILITARY APPEARS TO BE BOGGED DOWN IN [LOC IRAQ  ] , " SAID GELLET . 
PAGE 03 RUEHFRA2440 C O N F I D E N T I A L PARIS 002440 <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) GELLET SAID HIS OWN VIEW ( WHICH , HE CAUTIONED , IS NOT SHARED BY EVERYONE AT THE MFA ) , IS THAT IF THE EUROPEANS REALLY WANT TO AVOID A MILITARY CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE [LOC U.S.  ] AND [LOC IRAN  ] THEN THEY NEED TO SHOW THE IRANIANS THEY ARE SERIOUS ABOUT ECONOMIC SANCTIONS . 
" THE IRANIANS WILL NEVER BLINK UNTIL THEY FEEL THAT THE REGIME'S SURVIVAL IS AT [LOC STAKE  ] , " SAID GELLET . 
HE SUGGESTED THAT -- IN ADDITION TO A FURTHER SANCTIONS ON THE BANKING SECTOR , A FULL ARMS EMBARGO , AND A CUT IN EXPORT CREDITS -- THE IRANIANS MIGHT BE VULNERABLE TO AN EMBARGO OF REFINED PETROLEUM PRODUCTS . 
IN ADDITION , HE SUGGESTED THAT WE NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE DRAMATIC ISOLATING EFFECT THAT A BAN ON INTERNATIONAL AIR TRAVEL TO AND FROM [LOC IRAN  ] WOULD HAVE . 
GELLET NOTED THAT THESE WERE JUST HIS PERSONAL VIEWS , AND SAID THAT HE HAS NOT YET RECEIVED ANY GUIDANCE FROM THE NEW PRESIDENCY ON [LOC IRAN  ] SANCTIONS . 
HE OBSERVED THAT PRESIDENT SARKOZY TOOK A HARD LINE AGAINST THE IRANIAN NUCLEAR PROGRAM DURING HIS ELECTION CAMPAIGN , BUT SAID IT REMAINED TO BE SEEN WHAT THAT WOULD TRANSLATE INTO IN POLICY TERMS . 
PAGE 04 RUEHFRA2440 C O N F I D E N T I A L PARIS 002440 <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) GELLET , WHO SERVED FOR NEARLY THREE YEARS AT THE FRENCH EMBASSY IN BAGHDAD BEFORE ASSUMING HIS CURRENT POSITION , HAD A PARTICULARLY GRIM VIEW OF [LOC IRAQ  ] . 
" WE DON'T HAVE THE SLIGHTEST HOPE IT CAN BE SALVAGED -- IT'S LOST , " HE SAID . 
HE PREDICTED THAT [LOC IRAQ  ] WILL DESCEND INTO FULL-SCALE CIVIL WAR WHETHER OR NOT MNF-I REMAINS . 
ON THE OTHER HAND , HE PREDICTED THAT IF THE COALITION WERE TO WITHDRAW THERE WOULD BE AN IMMEDIATE AND HORRIFIC SPIKE IN THE LEVEL OF VIOLENCE . 
" YOUR DEPARTURE WOULD BE SEEN EVERYWHERE AS A SIGN THAT IT'S TIME FOR THE GLOVES TO COME OFF , " HE SAID . 
HE FURTHER PREDICTED THAT , IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE COALITION'S DEPARTURE ( WHENEVER THAT OCCURS ) , THE ENSUING CONFLICT WOULD LAST MANY YEARS UNTIL IRAQ'S SUNNIS AND SHIITES ( AND THEIR RESPECTIVE PATRONS ) WERE EXHAUSTED . 
AS FOR THE KURDS , GELLET SAID THEY SERIOUSLY UNDERESTIMATED THE RISK THAT THEY WOULD BE ANNIHILATED DURING THE COURSE OF A CIVIL WAR THAT WOULD LIKELY PULL IN MOST OF IRAQ'S NEIGHBORS , INCLUDING [LOC TURKEY.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) NOTWITHSTANDING HIS BLEAK ANALYSIS , GELLET ENCOURAGED PAGE 05 RUEHFRA2440 C O N F I D E N T I A L PARIS 002440 THE [LOC U.S.  ] TO CONTINUE ITS EFFORTS TO PROMOTE RECONCILIATION . 
HE NOTED THAT ONE COMPLAINT HE OFTEN HEARD FROM HIS SUNNI CONTACTS WAS THAT THEY RECEIVED CONFLICTING MESSAGES FROM THE VARIOUS USG AGENCIES ON THE GROUND IN [LOC IRAQ  ] , AND WERE NEVER SURE WHICH OF THEM HAD THE ULTIMATE DECISION-MAKING AUTHORITY . 
GELLET FINISHED BY WARNING THAT OUR TRIBAL ALLIES IN ANBAR PROVINCE WOULD TURN ON US WHENEVER IT SUITED THEIR INTERESTS TO DO SO .
