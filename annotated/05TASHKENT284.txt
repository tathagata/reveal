( C ) Summary: According to various reports from industry insiders , [PER Gulnora Karimova  ] , the President’s daughter , is interested in taking over a new cellular company with [LOC U.S.  ] investment , as well as Uzbektelekom , the monopoly state- owned telecommunications company . 
She also reportedly has agreed with local mafia boss , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , to take over his share of [LOC ZeromaxXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
In an ironic twist , if this comes to pass , it would leave [PER Gulnora  ] in control of [LOC Coca-Cola  ] - her ex-husband’s former company . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) According to various reports , since first daughter [PER Gulnora Karimova  ] returned to [LOC Uzbekistan  ] several months ago , she has been venturing out into new investments , mostly via several [MISC Russian  ] companies . 
For example , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] business sources have told us that [PER Karimova  ] may be behind recent moves to push [LOC U.S.  ] investment company [ORG Telecom Inc.  ] out of the [MISC Uzbek  ] market . 
[ORG Telecom Inc.  ] invested USD 12 million in a cellular telephone company called [ORG Skytel  ] . 
[ORG Skytel  ] uses [ORG CDMA  ] 450 frequency , which is new technology for the [MISC Uzbek  ] market . 
According to the [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , after several months in operation , [PER Gulnora Karimova  ] directly approached them about taking over some portion of the company . 
The [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] claimed that because the company did not respond to her requests , the company’s frequency has been jammed by an [MISC Uzbek  ] Government agency , making the cellular service nearly inoperable . 
According to this source , [ORG Telecom Inc.’s  ] [MISC Uzbek  ] partner , state-owned Uzbektelekom , is either unwilling or unable to help and has chosen to not return the [LOC U.S.  ] company’s phone calls. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) It appears that [PER Gulnora  ] would have been able to invest in [ORG Skytel  ] , regardless of [ORG Telecom Inc.’s  ] response to her query . 
Several sources , including [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , claim that [PER Gulnora  ] is positioning herself to take over Uzbektelekom . 
Recent legislative changes and revisions of the company’s privatization deal , lead post to believe that there is an influential local investor vying for company leadership ( Ref A ) . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , only an investor with a close relationship to [MISC Uzbek  ] Government officials could convince them to make such a controversial change to legislation , basically guaranteeing colossal returns to the company’s owner and imposing losses on other firms . 
The new legislative changes dictate that all international telecommunication networks must go through Uzbektelekom , giving them monopoly control of all services , including [MISC Internet  ] and [MISC IP-telephony  ] . 
All indications point to [PER Gulnora  ] as this investor . 
BACK TO THE BASICS ------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Aside from her interests in the telecommunications industry , Emboff also heard from [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that [PER Gulnora  ] struck a deal with local Mafia boss [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] to take over his share of [LOC Zeromax  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] According to several sources , Zeromax’s largest revenue stream comes from organizing and transporting crude oil from [LOC Kazakhstan  ] for delivery to [ORG Uzbekneftegaz  ] , something post believed [PER Gulnora  ] to have been involved in for several years .
