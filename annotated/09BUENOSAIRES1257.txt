( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The [ORG Financial Action Task Force  ] ( [ORG FATF  ] ) held a two week peer review of the [MISC Argentine  ] anti-money laundering and counter terror finance ( AML/CFT ) regime . 
Although hoping to see some positive moves by [LOC Argentina  ] , the [ORG FATF  ] operational team leader is skeptical of the [ORG GoA  ] 's intentions to combat money laundering and terror finance . 
While most money laundering in [LOC Argentina  ] conceals tax evasion and corruption , narcotics-derived funds are a growing problem . 
The [MISC Argentine  ] statutory framework is relatively strong , but the bureaucracy working the issues is poorly led and starved of resources . 
Consequently , the [ORG FATF  ] team leader views [MISC Argentine  ] AML/CFT enforcement as largely ineffectual , with no meaningful prosecutions in recent memory . 
Some Embassy contacts argue that the current [ORG GoA  ] leadership , including the President , stands to lose from honest and vigorous pursuit of money laundering . 
While the final [ORG FATF  ] report is likely to embarrass the [ORG GoA  ] , potentially provoking a harsh response , it is not likely to spur meaningful reform . 
Until now , terror financing and narcotics money have comprised just a small fraction of the illicit funds transiting [LOC Argentina  ] . 
The near complete absence of enforcement coupled with a culture of impunity and corruption make [LOC Argentina  ] ripe for exploitation by narco-traffickers and terrorist cells . 
For now , the most promising way to engage the [ORG GoA  ] on the issue seems to be through the new Justice Minister , with whom we have developed a positive working relationship . 
We will encourage him to engage on this set of issues . 
End Summary. --------------- [ORG FATF Review  ] --------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The [ORG FATF  ] peer review of [LOC Argentina  ] 's [MISC AML/CFT  ] laws , regulations and enforcement , and general compliance with [ORG FATF  ] best practices and recommendations began on November 16 and continued for two weeks . 
[ORG FATF  ] had originally scheduled the review for last year but delayed it at [LOC Argentina  ] 's request . 
In the interim , the [ORG GoA  ] implemented a tax amnesty law to encourage the repatriation of funds held overseas and in the process lost most of the [MISC AML/CFT  ] focus and momentum it had built up after the last [ORG FATF  ] review in October 2003 . 
Econoff met with numerous [MISC AML/CFT  ] contacts over several weeks before the review began to assess the strengths and weaknesses of [LOC Argentina  ] 's laws and enforcement efforts and to evaluate perceptions of how it will fare in the review. --------------------------------- [ORG FATF  ] Team Leader is a [MISC Skeptic  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Fabio Contini  ] , the [MISC Italian  ] national who heads the operational review team , has spent over a year in [LOC Argentina  ] as the [ORG Economic and Financial AttachC  ] ) at the [MISC Italian  ] Embassy and is married to an [MISC Argentine  ] . 
He has a sober view of the [ORG GoA  ] 's [MISC AML/CFT  ] efforts , which he deems little more than a fig-leaf . 
The measures taken , he said , are calculated for minimal compliance with international standards and evince little real enthusiasm for cleaning up the financial system . 
In addition , he said that [LOC Argentina  ] should take control of the informal economy as a first step toward a serious [MISC AML/CFT  ] effort . 
[PER Contini  ] summarized his views by noting that a substantial percentage of the [MISC Argentine  ] economy is underground , with pure cash transactions comprising a disproportionate percentage of economic activity . 
Such an economic system , he observed , is inherently vulnerable to money laundering and other financial crimes . 
[PER Contini  ] said that [LOC Argentina  ] will have to bring this black economy into the light of day before even the most robust AML/CFT regulations can be effective. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) While his views will be influential , [PER Contini  ] noted that he does not have the last word on [LOC Argentina  ] 's [ORG FATF  ] peer assessment . 
Once his team makes its report , [LOC Argentina  ] will have an opportunity to respond to the findings . 
A debate at next year 's plenary will precede the issuance of the final report and any warnings . 
[PER Contini  ] said that [ORG FATF  ] warned [LOC Argentina  ] after the last review that a second warning could have a negative effect on [LOC Argentina  ] 's desire to rejoin the international financial system. -------------------------------- Money Laundering in [LOC Argentina  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Embassy contacts agree that most money laundering in [LOC Argentina  ] is the product of tax evasion and political corruption . 
For the most part , they insist that terror financing is seldom , if ever , transacted in [LOC Argentina  ] . 
Most maintain , however , that narcotics trafficking is becoming a real problem and that , increasingly , the dirty money sloshing through the financial system originates in the drug trade. ------------------- AML/CFT System ------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Embassy contacts , including [PER Contini  ] , have noted numerous weaknesses in [LOC Argentina  ] 's AML/CFT regime . 
Most tellingly , there have been only two convictions since the criminalization of money laundering in 1989 , and there have been no convictions under the currently applicable statute enacted in 2000 . 
While the substantive law is generally considered adequate , there are numerous loopholes to close and important areas that require clarification. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Local AML/CFT experts agree that , with the exceptions noted below , [LOC Argentina  ] has a solid legal and regulatory foundation for combating money laundering and terror finance . 
The failures of the system arise when it comes to applying the law . 
Inspections are superficial and do not examine actual accounts and transactions . 
According to [PER Pablo San Martin  ] , the head of [PER SMS Latinoamerica  ] , a local accounting firm , inspectors are often content in their interviews with banking executives to accept the predictable anodyne responses to their inquiries without further follow-up . 
Several contacts point to the [ORG Financial Information Unit  ] ( UIF ) as the weakest player on the financial crimes enforcement team , but the consensus is that a failure of political will cripples the whole [MISC AML/CFT  ] project. --------------- Self-laundering --------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Several experts have highlighted the money laundering loophole for criminals who do their own banking as a probable focus of the [ORG FATF  ] review . 
[MISC Argentine  ] law defines money laundering as an accessory offense so that , for example , a narcotics trafficker cannot be charged for merely laundering the profits from his drug deals . 
Only a third party who aids and abets in hiding the origins of the money is subject to prosecution. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) According to [PER Raul Plee  ] , the state 's attorney who heads the unit charged with investigating financial crimes , this exemption for self-laundering explains the lack of convictions . 
[PER Plee  ] noted that a bill in draft form would allow him to pursue much of the currently protected laundering activity , and he believes that [ORG FATF  ] will recommend enactment of the legislation . 
[PER Plee  ] observed that some of [LOC Argentina  ] 's most embarrassing prosecutorial failures , e.g. , when a judge dismissed charges against [PER Pablo Escobar  ] 's widow who bought two properties under an assumed name , originate in the self-laundering exemption. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) In contrast , other contacts believe that if the [ORG FATF  ] review fixates on the self-laundering issue it will be a failure . 
[PER Marcelo Casanovas  ] , a compliance officer with the [ORG Bank of Buenos Aires Province  ] and a board member of a leading anti-money laundering association , said that self-laundering is a problem , but to focus exclusively on that one shortcoming is to miss the whole forest for one tree . 
The real problems , he insisted , are systemic . 
[PER Contini  ] himself observed that the central failure is an absence of political will to pursue laundering as a serious crime. ---------------------- Repatriation of Funds ---------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) One substantive legal issue that now seems unlikely to trouble [ORG FATF  ] reviewers is the tax amnesty law ( Ref A ) designed to encourage repatriation of funds held outside [LOC Argentina  ] . 
According to commonly cited estimates , [MISC Argentines  ] hide about $150 billion in assets offshore . 
In an effort to lure back the billions held outside the formal financial system , the [ORG GoA  ] passed legislation in December 2008 declaring an amnesty on repatriated funds that ran from March through August of 2009 . 
Local experts and opposition political figures alleged that because it prohibited [MISC Argentine  ] tax authorities from inquiring into the source of the repatriated funds , the law facilitated money laundering . 
[ORG FATF  ] also expressed misgivings but was at least partially placated when then-Justice Minister [PER Anibal Fernandez  ] defended the law before the plenary in [LOC Paris  ] . 
In May ( after the amnesty had already been in effect for two months ) , the [ORG UIF  ] issued rules requiring reports of suspicious transactions ( [MISC STRs  ] ) arising from the capital regularization program. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) According to figures released by the [ORG GoA  ] at the conclusion of the amnesty , [MISC Argentines  ] declared only $4.7 billion . 
Of that , only 4.3 percent had been held abroad . 
The press reported that the program failed to achieve its goal of capital repatriation . 
According to [PER Plee  ] , requiring submission of [MISC STRs  ] was a key factor in this failure and was at least one reason that very little money returned under this law . 
[PER Plee  ] and other contacts noted that the funds declared under the amnesty were not generally the product of criminal activity other than simple tax evasion . 
The [ORG Regional Advisor  ] from the [ORG International Monetary Fund  ] 's [ORG Financial Integrity Group  ] , [PER Mariano Federici  ] , observed that the repatriation was doomed from the outset because [MISC Argentines  ] do not view the local economy as a stable place to invest , and they mistrust the government because of its history of economic mismanagement and capricious seizure of assets. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Based on the requirement to file [MISC STRs  ] and the insignificant scale of the funds repatriated , many contacts predicted that the tax amnesty issue will not draw much attention under the [ORG FATF  ] review. ------------------------ Prosecutors and Judges ------------------------ <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Another weakness that experts highlighted was the lack of judicial and prosecutorial understanding of AML/CFT issues . 
According to [PER Federici  ] , the prosecutors and judges who should take the lead in AML/CFT cases lack the financial sophistication necessary to direct investigations and mount successful prosecutions . 
[PER Federici  ] also noted that judges appear uninterested in acquiring the skills necessary to manage money laundering cases . 
When the [ORG IMF  ] staged a training seminar , over 70 prosecutors participated , but of the dozens invited , only one judge chose to attend . 
Because judges directly manage investigations under the [MISC Argentine  ] legal system , no money laundering case can proceed without active judicial engagement . 
[PER Federici  ] observed that , in the short term , judicial indifference limits the opportunities for money laundering convictions. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER Casanovas  ] agreed that the judicial system suffers deficiencies , but he maintained that prosecutors and investigators bear more of the blame than judges . 
Failure to develop solid evidence is the root of the problem , he said . 
He observed that judges want to pursue concrete cases with predictable outcomes , not squander their limited resources on prosecutions doomed to failure. ---------------------------------- FATF/GAFISUD Representative ---------------------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) The [ORG FATF  ] Representative 's Office , headed by [PER Alejandro Strega  ] , who has a master 's in law from the [ORG University of Illinois  ] , is responsible for coordination of [MISC AML/CFT  ] policy and for developing national strategy and legislation . 
Under the leadership of [PER Strega  ] 's predecessor , [PER Juan Felix Marteau  ] , the office earned a reputation for foresight and action . 
[PER Marteau  ] drafted significant legislation and developed a national [MISC AML/CFT  ] strategy that was endorsed by then- President [PER Nestor Kirchner  ] . 
In contrast , [PER Strega  ] 's performance has been lackluster , and , with his weak background in [MISC AML/CFT  ] and lack of resources , he has been largely ineffective . 
[PER Strega  ] is a congenial interlocutor , speaks [MISC English  ] well , and is eager to engage with the Embassy , but he has little access to Minister of Justice [PER Julio Alak  ] , few staff , and almost no money. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [PER Marteau  ] has insinuated that he lost the job to [PER Strega  ] as a reprisal for looking too closely into the casino business , where important Kirchneristas allegedly have interests . 
[PER Federici  ] conceded that casinos may be part of the story , but said the real explanation lies in a personality clash and bureaucratic feud with [PER Alak  ] 's predecessor and current Chief of Cabinet , [PER Anibal Fernandez  ] . 
According to [PER Federici  ] , when [PER Marteau  ] drafted his national strategy , he consulted all high government officials with an interest in money laundering except for [PER Fernandez  ] , who was Minister of Interior at that time . 
As Justice Minister , [PER Fernandez  ] became [PER Marteau  ] 's boss and quickly dismissed him and brought in [PER Strega  ] . 
[PER Federici  ] also noted that suspicions of connections to drug trafficking and money laundering have sometimes wafted around [PER Fernandez  ] ( Ref B ) , and [PER Marteau  ] may have distrusted him based on those rumors . 
[PER Strega  ] is the son of a labor lawyer who is a close [PER Fernandez  ] confederate from his time as Mayor of [LOC Quilmes  ] . 
His father , [PER Enrique Strega  ] , has been an attorney for the bank workers' union headed by [PER Juan Jose Zanola  ] , a [PER Kirchner  ] ally who was also close to former President [PER Menem  ] . 
[PER Zanola  ] is now under indictment in a politically radioactive case involving adulterated medicine , illegal campaign contributions , and a triple homicide. ------------------------- UIF: a [ORG Broken Institution  ] ------------------------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( S/NF ) Numerous Embassy contacts and press reports have fingered the [ORG UIF  ] as the main agent of [LOC Argentina  ] 's [MISC AML/CFT  ] failures . 
The [ORG UIF  ] is an inept and politically compromised institution , according to [PER Federici  ] . 
It is led by [PER Rosa Falduto  ] , who won her position based on the patronage of the judge who oversees the electoral process , [PER Maria Romilda Servini de Cubria  ] . 
She has since quarreled with [PER Servini  ] . 
Her other benefactor , [PER Anibal Fernandez  ] , has also reportedly been keeping his distance . 
[PER Federici  ] said that according to a highly placed contact in the [ORG UIF  ] , [PER Falduto  ] holds on to her position because she is useful to President [PER Cristina Fernandez  ] de [PER Kirchner  ] and to her husband , the former President , [PER Nestor Kirchner  ] . 
[PER Federici  ] told Econoff that [PER Falduto  ] is personally holding back [MISC STRs  ] on the [PER Kirchner  ] inner circle and has refused to respond to requests for [MISC STRs  ] on the Kirchners themselves from [LOC Switzerland  ] , [PER Lichtenstein  ] , and [LOC Luxembourg  ] . 
In July , according to [PER Federici  ] and consistent with information from other sources , [PER Falduto  ] also personally leaked information that the [ORG UIF  ] had requested from [LOC FinCEN  ] on [MISC Francisco  ] de [PER Narvaez  ] , a [PER Kirchner  ] rival . 
According to [PER Federici  ] , [PER Falduto  ] did this by design to harm the reputation of this important opposition figure. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) The defects of the [ORG UIF  ] , however , transcend mere politicization . 
According to [PER Federici  ] and confirmed by several other sources , [PER Falduto  ] 's organization passes on raw intelligence that is useless for building criminal cases . 
[PER Contini  ] said that information is routinely forwarded to prosecutors so long after the fact that it is legally and technically impossible to accumulate evidence on suspicious transactions . 
In the [ORG UIF  ] 's defense , however , [LOC San Martin  ] noted that the [MISC AML/CFT  ] regulators have insufficient resources . 
The [ORG UIF  ] and the [ORG Argentine Central Bank  ] pay poorly , he said , and cannot afford to hire sufficient investigative staff . 
[LOC San Martin  ] agreed , however , that the [ORG UIF  ] is likely to come in for pointed criticism in the [ORG FATF  ] review. -------------- Political Will -------------- <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) Several contacts , including [PER Strega  ] himself , have asserted that the [MISC Argentine  ] AML/CFT regime was never designed to catch or punish money launderers and that the absence of convictions is by design . 
According to [PER Federici  ] , [ORG Plee  ] 's office does not get the political support that it needs to do its job and the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] under [PER Fernandez  ] made it plain that it did not want him to be too aggressive . 
When the [ORG MOJ  ] switched [ORG Plee  ] 's assistant [PER Federico di Pasquale  ] from a long-term to a short-term job contract , it was seen as a message that the office was on a short leash. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) According to [PER Roberto Bulit Goni  ] , an attorney in a private practice dealing with money laundering issues , too many people stand to profit from lax enforcement of money laundering statutes . 
[PER Casanovas  ] and [LOC San Martin  ] agree that the changes that there have been in the [MISC AML/CFT  ] system are mainly cosmetic . 
The [ORG GoA  ] has enacted the recommended laws and regulations , but the problem , they noted , is hostility to even token enforcement . 
[ORG Congress  ] , which will pass to a divided opposition 's control in December , has not played a consistent role in pressing for enforcement or investigations , but there is some prospect that the [ORG Congress  ] and specific committees will give it increasing attention in 2010. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) The Embassy sources noted above maintain that the [ORG MOJ  ] , under former Minister of Justice [PER Anibal Fernandez  ] ( now Chief of Cabinet ) , systematically frustrated progress on [MISC AML/CFT  ] issues . 
The current Minister of [ORG Justice  ] , [PER Julio Alak  ] , has brought energy and a fresh perspective to the job and has shown considerable enthusiasm for collaborating with the [LOC United States  ] on a wide range of law enforcement issues . 
While he has not yet focused on money laundering , the upcoming [ORG FATF  ] report and the [MISC Argentine  ] response and debate at next year 's plenary give us an opportunity to engage him to focus more on [MISC AML/CFT  ] issues . 
While a negative report will likely provoke a hostile response from some quarters of the [ORG GoA  ] , it could well provide an opportunity and political cover for [PER Alak  ] to push for greater resources and for consequential changes in the law and enforcement . 
[PER Alak  ] appears to be serious about tackling [LOC Argentina  ] 's law enforcement problems ( Ref C ) and all Mission elements will continue to provide him with the information and , where possible , the resources to move forward with a positive agenda. ---------------- [ORG FATF  ] Outcome ----------------- <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( C ) There are two views of the likely conclusions in the final [ORG FATF  ] report . 
One view is that the [ORG FATF  ] review will be so superficial that [LOC Argentina  ] will pass with just a few areas for improvement noted . 
[PER Casanovas  ] and [LOC San Martin  ] , for example , believe that the [ORG FATF  ] review will be perfunctory . 
Reviewers will arrive with a checklist and conclude after talking to regulators that all the elements are in place . 
[ORG FATF  ] will recommend some changes , but the review will be generally neutral . 
The other view is that the flaws are so glaring , i.e. , no convictions and the problems within the [ORG UIF  ] , that even a superficial review will come down hard on the [ORG GoA  ] . 
[PER Contini  ] , as head of the operational team , seems inclined to issue a report highlighting a lack of political will to meaningfully combat money laundering and terror financing. ---------- Comment ---------- <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( S/NF ) [LOC Argentina  ] will likely suffer some sharp criticism in the [ORG FATF  ] review , blackening its eye when it is seeking to reenter the mainstream of the global financial system . 
The [ORG GOA  ] would probably lash out publicly at a critical [ORG FATF  ] review , with the government blaming the criticisms on external conspirators ( including perhaps the [ORG USG  ] ) . 
No matter the criticisms , and despite the apparent good faith of new players like Justice Minister [PER Alak  ] , it is probably unrealistic to expect that the [ORG GoA  ] will funnel resources to prosecutors or make a concerted effort to pursue money launderers . 
The Kirchners and their circle simply have too much to gain themselves from continued lax enforcement . 
Although tax cheats and compromised politicians may still be the chief source of dirty money , continued [ORG GoA  ] indifference to [MISC AML/CFT  ] could offer an attractive local staging ground to narco-traffickers and international terrorists . 
If the [ORG GoA  ] does not move to close loopholes and enhance enforcement , it may soon find its financial system contaminated by drug money and terror funds .
