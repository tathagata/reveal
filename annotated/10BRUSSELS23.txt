[ORG MFA Optimistic on Court  ] for S ) erra [PER Leone Donation  ] --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The [MISC AfricQ  ] team of Director General [PER Renier Nijskens  ] , [PER C/ngo Desk Officer  ] [PER Hugues Chantry  ] , and Foreign MiQister [ORG Vanackere’s Africa Advisor  ] [PER Karl D’haene  ] met with S/WCI Ambassador [PER Rapp  ] , S/WCI Specia , Assistant [PER Todd Anderson  ] and [PER Poloff Aaron Jensen  ] on December 18 . 
Representatives of the [ORG MFA Legal and Peace Building  ] departments were also present . 
[PER D’haene  ] said he was optimistic that [LOC Belgium  ] would make an additional EUR 150,000 contribution to the [ORG Special Court  ] for [LOC Sierra Leone  ] . 
He noted [MISC Belgium’s  ] history of supporting international justice processes and posited that [MISC Belgium’s  ] new FM [ORG Vanackere  ] would continue that policy ; the expected closure of the [ORG Special Court  ] in 2011 after [PER Charles Taylor’s  ] trial made a contribution more likely in his view . 
[LOC Belgium  ] Interested in [MISC DRC Judicial Reform  ] ----------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [ORG MFA Africa  ] team was interested in the concept of chambers of mixed composition to deal with war crimes in the [ORG DRC  ] raised by Ambassador [PER Rapp  ] . 
They mentioned [MISC Belgium’s  ] participation in [LOC REJUSCO  ] , the [ORG EU  ] justice mission in [LOC Congo  ] , and [MISC Belgian  ] Technical Cooperation’s work on [MISC REJUSCO Phase I.  ] They were uncertain who would implement Phase II . 
They focused on the importance of improving the national justice system , rather than simply building up capacity in the eastern [ORG DRC  ] . 
[PER D’haene  ] was noncommittal on [MISC Belgian  ] support for new judicial court structures in the [ORG DRC  ] , but said that the [ORG GOB  ] would support UNR 1888 ( Resolution on Women , Peace , and Security , which includes judicial aspects ) and provide expertise to the extent that [LOC Belgium  ] had it . 
He added that sending judges to the [ORG DRC  ] would not be too difficult , but questioned whether a larger approach to judicial reform that included two court formats would work in the [ORG DRC  ] . 
[LOC Belgium  ] and the [ORG ICC  ] ------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Rapp  ] told [ORG Legal Department DG Rietjens  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] was proud to regain its observer status at the [ORG ICC  ] and said that the [LOC U.S.  ] was currently producing a review of its [ORG ICC  ] policy . 
He noted , however , that [LOC U.S.  ] ratification of the [ORG ICC  ] treaty was not likely . 
Ambassador [PER Rapp  ] underscored that the [LOC U.S.  ] believed only the [ORG UNSC  ] should be able to refer cases of crimes of aggression to the [ORG ICC  ] and was confident that other [ORG UNSC  ] members , including the [MISC European  ] members of the [LOC P5  ] , [LOC France  ] and the [LOC UK  ] , would agree . 
He said the [LOC U.S.  ] hoped for consensus in this discussion , and he expressed understanding for [MISC Belgian  ] , [MISC German  ] , and [MISC Greek  ] efforts to push for a broader [ORG ICC  ] mandate on crimes of aggression . 
Rientjens acknowledged [LOC U.S.  ] concerns on crimes of aggression , but said that [LOC Belgium  ] would continue to push for the [ORG ICC  ] to have an independent authority to initiate trials on crimes of [LOC BRUSSELS  ] 00000023 002 OF 002 aggression . 
[ORG Rietjens  ] praised the [LOC U.S.  ] return to observer status at the [ORG ICC  ] . 
He said [LOC Belgium  ] and other [MISC European  ] nations were excited to be able to have diplomatic discussions with the [LOC U.S.  ] about the [ORG ICC  ] once again. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 .
