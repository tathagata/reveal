<code><pre>S E C R E T ALGIERS 001162 NOFORN SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 12/30/2024 TAGS PREL , PINR , MOPS , [ORG KCOM  ] , AG , [ORG US SUBJECT: OVER-FLIGHT CLEARANCE  ] FOR AFRICOM [MISC EP-3  ] MISSIONS: PRELIMINARY [MISC ALGERIAN  ] RESPONSE REF: SECSTATE 130969 Classified By: [ORG DCM  ] [PER William Jordan  ] for reasons 1.4 . 
( b ) , ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG OSC  ] Chief delivered reftel request for [MISC EP-3  ] overflight permission to the [MISC Algerian  ] [ORG Defense Ministry’s Office of External Relations and Cooperation  ] ( [ORG DREC  ] ) on December 29 . 
There was no immediate response , but the [ORG DREC  ] summoned [ORG OSC  ] Chief for a follow-up meeting December 30 to state that ( 1 ) no decision was possible before next week and ( 2 ) overflight requests generally require two-weeks advance notice before they can be approved. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG DCM  ] , on December 30 , double-tracked the request with [MISC Algerian  ] MFA DG for the [ORG Americas  ] [PER Sabri Boukadoum  ] . 
In presenting the message , [ORG DCM  ] stressed ( 1 ) that the request was intended to survey the SIGINT environment in areas of [LOC Mauritania  ] and [LOC Mali  ] where [ORG AQIM  ] operates , ( 2 ) that , without knowing what that survey would yield , the [ORG USG  ] could not make any commitments ahead of time as to what data it might share with the [ORG GOA  ] , and ( 3 ) that the request should be regarded in large measure as a follow-up to the recent visit by AFRICOM Commander General [PER Ward  ] and a demonstration of the enhanced security cooperation we want to support in the face of the [ORG AQIM  ] threat in the trans-Sahara region . 
He further explained that we had made the same request to other governments in the region and were awaiting their responses. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Boukadoum  ] asked for information on the expected flight path of the [MISC EP-3  ] over [MISC Algerian  ] airspace ( [ORG DCM  ] confirmed that , departing from [LOC Rota  ] , the flights would likely overfly the southwestern corner near [LOC Tindouf  ] ) , whether the aircraft would seek to overfly [LOC Mauritania  ] and [LOC Mali  ] on each mission ( [ORG DCM  ] responded that the missions would be divided between those principally flying over [LOC Mali  ] or [LOC Mauritania  ] but not both ) , and whether collection would occur inside [MISC Algerian  ] airspace ( [ORG DCM  ] reiterated the notation in reftel that the aircraft would not collect on [ORG AQIM  ] in [LOC Algeria  ] unless the [ORG GOA  ] specifically requested it ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) As with the [ORG DREC  ] , [PER Boukadoum  ] indicated that we should not expect a definitive answer before next week . 
He agreed , however , to forward our request up his hierarchy immediately . 
[PER Boukadoum  ] expected that the highest levels of the [ORG GOA  ] would consider the request. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Comment: Although  ] post will be closed for the [MISC New Year  ] holiday from COB December 30 , our interlocutors know how to reach key [MISC Embassy POCs  ] if and as necessary before we reopen on Sunday , January 3 . 
In the meantime , and given the [MISC DREC’s  ] stress on the longstanding requirement for two-weeksQ , notice prior to any overflight , operational planners for this mission should be prepared to provide at least a notional schedule for flights should we get indications that the [ORG GOA  ] and neighboring countries are prepared to provide clearance . 
We stressed the number of sorties and timeframe envisaged under this concept of operations , but we should not expect to receive blanket clearance for all overflights . 
Having as much advance information on the flights as possible to share with the [ORG GOA  ] would minimize the potential need to have to clear each and every mission with 14-days advance notice .
