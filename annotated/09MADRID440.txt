( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: [ORG Spanish National Court  ] ( [ORG Audiencia Nacional  ] ) investigating judge [PER Baltasar Garzon  ] has announced he will pursue an investigation into allegations the [LOC U.S.  ] tortured terrorism detainees at [ORG Guantanamo  ] . 
He has yet to name any targets of his investigation . 
This comes days after he was forced to give up a related complaint filed by an NGO against six [ORG Bush Administration  ] officials ( ref a ) . 
At the urging of [MISC Spanish  ] prosecutors , the earlier case was reassigned to another [ORG National Court  ] judge who now appears to be trying shelve the case . 
The Chief Prosecutor for the [ORG National Court  ] tells us he will also fight [PER Garzon’s  ] latest move . 
Nevertheless , we suspect [PER Garzon  ] will wring all the publicity he can from the case unless and until he is forced to give it up . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) [PER Garzon  ] bowed to arguments by [MISC Spanish  ] prosecutors and April 17 forwarded to [ORG National Court  ] docketing authorities a case recently filed against six [ORG Bush Administration  ] officials ( ref a ) . 
That case was duly assigned to investigating judge [PER Eloy Velasco  ] . 
We learned May 5 that [PER Velasco  ] has declined to process that case saying that before moving forward the [ORG USG  ] should be asked if proceedings are underway in the [LOC U.S.  ] He also offered to transfer the proceedings to the [LOC U.S.  ] under the [ORG MLAT  ] . 
We are waiting for a copy of Velasco’s ruling and will advise further when we receive it . 
Meanwhile , [PER Garzon  ] announced April 29 that he was commencing a separate investigation into alleged [LOC U.S.  ] torture of terrorism detainees. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG LEGATT  ] and Embassy [ORG FSN Legal Advisor  ] met May 4 with [ORG National Court  ] Chief Prosecutor [PER Javier Zaragoza  ] ( protect ) to discuss [MISC Garzon’s  ] latest move . 
[PER Zaragoza  ] said he had challenged [PER Garzon  ] directly and personally on this latest case , asking if he was trying to drum up more speaking fees . 
[PER Garzon  ] replied he was doing it for the record only and would let it die . 
[PER Zaragoza  ] opined that [PER Garzon  ] , having gotten his headline , would soon drop the matter . 
In case he does not , [PER Zaragoza  ] has a strategy to force his hand . 
Zaragoza’s strategy hinges on the older case in which [PER Garzon  ] investigated terrorism complaints against some [ORG Guantanamo  ] detainees . 
In connection with those earlier investigations , [PER Garzon  ] ordered the [MISC Spanish  ] police to visit [ORG Guantanamo  ] and collect evidence against the suspected terrorists . 
[PER Zaragoza  ] reasons that he can use this fact to embarrass [PER Garzon  ] into dropping this latest case by suggesting [PER Garzon  ] in some sense condoned the [LOC U.S.  ] approach to detainee issues circa 2004 . 
[PER Garzon  ] took no action in 2004 when the suspects returned to [LOC Spain  ] and reported to him their alleged mistreatment . 
[PER Zaragoza  ] said that if [PER Garzon  ] could not be shamed into dropping the case , then he would formally recommend [PER Garzon  ] do so and appeal if [PER Garzon  ] ignored him. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Key to Zaragoza’s plans is the fact that there is yet another [MISC Guantanamo-related  ] case underway in the [ORG National Court  ] . 
That case relates to so-called [ORG CIA  ] flights carrying detainees to [ORG Guantanamo  ] via [LOC Spain  ] and is being heard by investigating Judge [PER Ismael Moreno  ] ( ref c ) . 
The police officers whom [PER Garzon  ] sent to [ORG Guantanamo  ] years ago are expected to testify before [PER Moreno  ] this month , and [PER Zaragoza  ] hopes their testimony will put on record [MISC Garzon’s  ] role in the earlier cases . 
( Note: In opening his most recent [ORG Guantanamo  ] investigation , [PER Garzon  ] asked that [PER Moreno  ] turn his detainee flights case over to him ; [PER Zaragoza  ] thought there was no chance [PER Moreno  ] would agree to do so . 
End note . 
) [PER Zaragoza  ] is also banking on the fact that [PER Garzon  ] is already in hot water over his excessive zeal in another case . 
A few months ago , [PER Garzon  ] opened an investigation into [MISC Spanish  ] civil war atrocities . 
[PER Garzon  ] persisted in his investigation in the face of all advice to the contrary from prosecutors . 
The case was finally wrestled away from [PER Garzon  ] , but there is now a criminal complaint against him in the [ORG Supreme Court  ] , alleging abuse of authority . 
That complaint has the support of [MISC Spanish  ] prosecutors . 
[PER Zaragoza  ] doubts [PER Garzon  ] will risk a second such complaint. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As we have reported , with respect to the earlier complaint against six [ORG Bush Administration  ] officials , [PER Zaragoza  ] has repeatedly suggested that a [ORG USG  ] affirmation that the [LOC U.S.  ] is investigating the torture issue could help dispose of [PER MADRID  ] 00000440 002.2 OF 002 [MISC Spanish  ] judicial inquires into the subject . 
In that regard , the [MISC Spanish  ] press reported today that [ORG National Court  ] investigating judge [PER Fernando Andreu  ] , who is handling a case against [MISC Israeli  ] officials accused of war crimes in [LOC Gaza  ] in 2002 , has refused to drop the case despite a request from prosecutors . 
The prosecutors had argued that [LOC Israel  ] was investigating the matter . 
In refusing to close the case , [PER Andreu  ] argued that [LOC Gaza  ] was not part of [LOC Israel  ] and thus [MISC Israeli  ] authorities were not the ones who should be investigating crimes allegedly committed there . 
The press reports that the President of the [ORG Supreme Court  ] and [ORG Spain’s Judicial Council  ] ( [ORG Consejo General  ] del [ORG Poder Judicial )  ] , [PER Carlos Divar  ] , is arguing for reforming the jurisdiction of the [ORG National Court  ] to avoid having it turned into the “judicial police of the world.” [PER Zaragoza  ] has commented to us that while many talk about limiting [ORG Spain’s  ] universal jurisdiction rules , it is unlikely politicians will act to do so . 
Comment ------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) We believe [PER Zaragoza  ] is acting in good faith and playing a constructive role . 
Certainly he knows [PER Garzon  ] better than we do , having sparred with him before . 
Nevertheless , we do not share his optimism that this problem will go away anytime soon . 
Having started , it is hard for us to see why the publicity-loving [PER Garzon  ] would shut off his headline-generating machine unless forced to do so . 
And forcing him to do so could take months . 
We also fear [PER Garzon  ] -- far from being deterred by threats of disciplinary action -- may welcome the chance for martyrdom , knowing the case will attract worldwide attention . 
In any event , we will probably be dealing with this issue for some time to come . 
[PER Zaragoza  ] will be in [LOC Washington  ] in early June for [MISC LEGATT-organized  ] consultations on [LOC CT  ] cooperation . 
L and DOJ may wish take that opportunity to discuss these cases with him directly at that time .
