( C ) Summary/Action Request . 
On 12 April Ambassador and PolCouns met for a private lunch at the [LOC COM Residence  ] with the [ORG Presidency 's Civil Household Minister  ] and Presidential Chief of Staff [PER Jose Dirceu  ] , who was accompanied by his international affairs advisor , Ambassador [PER Americo Fontanelles  ] . 
[PER Dirceu  ] , who is President [PER Lula da Silva  ] 's closest advisor , indicated he will travel to [LOC Caracas  ] this week to meet President [PER Chavez  ] , carrying a strong message ( cleared by [PER Lula  ] ) that [PER Chavez  ] should stand down from his provocative rhetoric and focus on his country 's internal problems . 
[PER Dirceu  ] also enthusiastically supported the idea of a meeting at the earliest opportunity between Presidents [PER Bush  ] and [PER Lula  ] to " clear the air " on [LOC Venezuela  ] and seek a formula for breaking [LOC FTAA  ] discussions out of the current " state of paralysis . 
" Ambassador and [PER Dirceu  ] discussed the possibility of a meeting on the margins of the [MISC G-8  ] in [LOC Scotland  ] in July , and both said they would stay in touch on this or other options as they coordinated with their governments . 
Action request: Mission requests Department and [ORG NSC  ] assess desirability and feasibility of a presidential bilateral on the margins of the [MISC G-8  ] , or other options for a meeting between President [PER Bush  ] and [PER Lula  ] in the next two to three months . 
End summary/request . 
VENEZUELA: CARRYING A MESSAGE TO [PER CHAVEZ  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Ambassador said that in his meetings in recent days in [LOC Washington  ] , it had been explained that the [ORG USG  ] 's approach to [PER Chavez  ] henceforth would be lower key , with [LOC Washington  ] lowering its rhetorical signature so [PER Chavez  ] would have fewer targets or excuses for anti-U.S. rants . 
Left in a vacuum , [PER Chavez  ] 's own words and actions would reveal his true nature to others , and the [ORG USG  ] is disposed to " let him hang himself " in the forum of world opinion , Ambassador added. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Dirceu  ] said that he is traveling to [LOC Caracas  ] in the next few days to meet [PER Chavez  ] , and is carrying a blunt message vetted by President [PER Lula  ] . 
The key points of the message are: -- " Stop playing with fire.. . 
" [PER Chavez  ] 's provocations against the [LOC U.S.  ] do not serve [LOC Venezuela  ] 's national interests and are an issue of concern to [LOC Brazil  ] and his other neighbors . 
Drawing on his conversations and experiences during recent travel in the [LOC U.S.  ] , [PER Dirceu  ] will tell [PER Chavez  ] that not only the [ORG USG  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] elites are hostile toward him -- [MISC American  ] business executives and even the " man in the street " now view [LOC Venezuela  ] as a problem for the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Dirceu  ] will stress to [PER Chavez  ] that such a tense situation with [MISC American  ] society cannot possibly benefit him or his country ; -- Focus on [LOC Venezuela  ] 's internal problems: [PER Dirceu  ] will tell [PER Chavez  ] that in the [ORG GOB  ] 's estimation he should have his hands full dealing with his economic problems , social restiveness and development issues . 
Those are [LOC Venezuela  ] 's internal concerns but they affect [MISC Brazilian  ] assessments of commercial and integration prospects and [PER Chavez  ] should do his homework , [PER Dirceu  ] said. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Continuing on [LOC Venezuela  ] , [PER Dirceu  ] said the [ORG GOB  ] does not believe [PER Chavez  ] 's arms purchase plans indicate external military designs . 
A [MISC Colombia-Venezuela  ] conflict would be catastrophic for both countries , [PER Dirceu  ] said . 
[PER Chavez  ] 's possible purchase of thousands of [MISC AK-47  ] assault rifles appears directed toward his arming of the local militias he is forming , [PER Dirceu  ] said , but he did not elaborate on why [PER Chavez  ] is forming militias except to observe that [PER Chavez  ] " feels threatened . 
" [PER Dirceu  ] seemed dismissive of the value of conventional arms in [LOC South America  ] , asking Ambassador and PolCouns how long they thought [MISC Venezuelan  ] F-16s or MIGs ( if the GOV purchases them ) could stay in the air against a modern foe ( read [MISC USAF  ] ) . 
Unless a country chooses to have long-range missiles or nuclear devices it has no significant deterrent against a powerful national enemy , [PER Dirceu  ] opined , and hence most conventional weapons -- however flashy or costly -- are largely toys for appeasing the " artifacts of national militaries " in developing countries , and not a serious threat to any other state. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Ambassador noted that the use of the term " strategic alliance " by [PER Chavez  ] and [PER Lula  ] , and the apparent reluctance of [PER Lula  ] and regional leaders to openly refute or criticize [PER Chavez  ] 's most outrageous comments can lead some observers to assume that [LOC Brazil  ] and others tacitly agree with [PER Chavez  ] 's views and that [PER Chavez  ] is the alliance 's de facto spokesman . 
[PER Dirceu  ] did not respond directly , but assured Ambassador that " there is not a single item of anti-American intent " in [LOC Brazil  ] 's regional policy matrix . 
He said that the [ORG GOB  ] is focused on integration and economic development , and wants to draw [PER Chavez  ] into " a practical agenda " that will shift his attention and energy in a more positive direction . 
[PER Dirceu  ] said that [PER Chavez  ] exerts virtually no influence over national leadership in any [MISC South American  ] state , and even in the places where his influence sometimes can be seen -- i.e. , [LOC Bolivia  ] and [LOC Ecuador  ] -- [PER Chavez  ] 's words and deeds have often backfired , as in the case of [LOC Bolivia  ] 's harsh public reaction to recent [PER Chavez  ] comments about [MISC Bolivian  ] internal affairs ( NFI , but see ref b ) . 
Ambassador rejoined that [PER Chavez  ] 's relative economic independence based on oil resources gives [LOC Brazil  ] and other neighboring states less leverage than they might think in persuading [PER Chavez  ] to focus on positive and practical regional integration issues . 
PRESIDENTIAL MEETING <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Following up on comments made by the Ambassador about the usefulness of a possible meeting between Presidents [PER Bush  ] and [PER Lula  ] in the next few months if a suitable time and venue could be found , [PER Dirceu  ] stressed that [PER Lula  ] believes it is becoming important to have such a meeting before the November Summit of the [ORG Americas  ] . 
[PER Dirceu  ] said it is crucial that the two Presidents talk candidly with each other , especially on two issues: [LOC Venezuela  ] and the direction of [LOC FTAA  ] . 
Beyond " clearing the air " on [LOC Venezuela  ] , the [ORG USG  ] and [ORG GOB  ] need to develop " a common approach " toward the whole [LOC Andean Ridge  ] and its various problems , as stability is strongly in the interest of both countries , [PER Dirceu  ] said. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) On [LOC FTAA  ] , [PER Dirceu  ] voiced strong concern about " the state of paralysis " and said the presidents could discuss finding a way to move ahead . 
[PER Dirceu  ] said the [ORG GOB  ] cannot afford to create the impression that it lacks interest in the [LOC FTAA  ] . 
In [PER Dirceu  ] 's view , [LOC Brazil  ] needs to increase its commercial activities with the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" one hundred fold " and [ORG FTAA  ] is an invaluable vehicle . 
He opined that in five to ten years [LOC South America  ] will be " one market " led by [LOC Brazil  ] , where hundreds of [LOC U.S.  ] firms based in [LOC Brazil  ] will have the opportunity to export goods and services across the continent . 
This " partnership " is key and needs to be strengthened ; [ORG FTAA  ] can help do this , and trade disputes should be relegated to " routine handling " in the [ORG WTO  ] and not allowed to slow cooperation , [PER Dirceu  ] said . 
8 . 
( C ) Ambassador and [PER Dirceu  ] discussed the possibility of a bilateral meeting on the margins of the July [MISC G-8  ] summit in [LOC Scotland  ] ( PM [PER Blair  ] has invited [PER Lula  ] ) and both said they would explore this and other options with their administrations , staying in touch on the issue . 
BILATERAL RELATIONS <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Early in the lunch meeting , [PER Dirceu  ] declared that [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] relations are at their best level " since [MISC World War II  ] . 
" Ambassador demurred on agreeing with this completely , but said the two countries cooperate well on a range of issue ( e.g. , counternarcotics ) , and that both Secretary Rice and Deputy Secretary [PER Zoellick  ] have a strong [MISC SIPDIS  ] interest in [LOC Brazil  ] and enhancing bilateral relations . 
Ambassador and PolCouns reviewed two pending bilateral issues -- i.e. , conclusion of a bilateral safeguards agreement for [LOC U.S.  ] participation in commercial launches at [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Alcantara  ] spaceport and the possibility of negotiating a defense cooperation agreement -- but Ambassador said he would like to see new initiatives for bilateral cooperation . 
He asked [PER Dirceu  ] to provide a list of areas in which the [ORG GOB  ] would like to expand its cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] , with a view to working on some of these questions prior to a possible POTUS visit later in the year . 
[PER Dirceu  ] undertook to provide suggestions. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Ambassador also broached with [PER Dirceu  ] the ongoing problem for the [LOC U.S. Mission  ] in selling its excess properties in [LOC Brazil  ] , owing to past issues with [LOC Brazil  ] 's social security system . 
[PER Dirceu  ] expressed a willingness to help and directed his international affairs advisor to work with the Embassy on the question . 
[LOC CUBA  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Turning briefly to [LOC Cuba  ] , [PER Dirceu  ] said that , despite the relationship between [PER Castro  ] and [PER Chavez  ] , it is not in [LOC Cuba  ] 's interest to " have the waters roiled " by [PER Chavez  ] 's provocations . 
On the contrary , [LOC Cuba  ] 's internal problems are so profound and its economy so fragile that [PER Castro  ] 's regime desperately needs a calm regional environment to attempt to deal with these issues and to try to attract more foreign investment . 
He reiterated statements he had made in his [LOC Washington  ] meetings , i.e. , that if the [ORG USG  ] allowed more direct [MISC American  ] commercial involvement and private sector contacts with [LOC Cuba  ] , the country would " be transformed beyond recognition in five years . 
" <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Comment and action request . 
[PER Jose Dirceu  ] remains [PER Lula  ] 's most important advisor , despite some waning of his influence . 
He retains [PER Lula  ] 's complete confidence , has a broad policy coordination role , and we assume that most of what he says closely reflects [PER Lula  ] 's own opinions and priorities . 
In that regard , [PER Dirceu  ] 's upcoming mission to [LOC Venezuela  ] and his expressed support for the [ORG FTAA  ] are intriguing . 
We will follow up with [PER Dirceu  ] 's office for a backbrief on the [PER Chavez  ] meeting , continue to probe for daylight between the internal positions of [LOC Dirceu/Lula  ] and others in the [ORG GOB  ] vice the foreign ministry on [ORG FTAA  ] , and we ask [LOC Washington  ] to weigh seriously the option of a meeting between President [PER Lula  ] and President [PER Bush  ] on the margins of the [MISC G-8  ] -- or some other option -- in the next two to three months . 
It appears that the top level of the [ORG GOB  ] wants to reach out to us -- perhaps even reaching around their own foreign ministry -- and we should try to find ways to reach back .
