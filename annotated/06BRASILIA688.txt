( U ) During an April 7 lunch with Emboffs , Directors [PER Denise Abreu  ] and [PER Leur Lomanto  ] of the newly created [ORG National Civil Aviation Agency  ] ( [ORG ANAC  ] ) asked that the [ORG FAA  ] extend a formal invitation to [ORG ANAC  ] representatives for May consultations in [LOC Washington  ] and [LOC Miami  ] . 
The purpose of their trip would to be to introduce themselves , to explain how [ORG ANAC  ] will work and to explore areas of mutual cooperation . 
While they had planned on an April trip to the [LOC US  ] , the deepening VARIG crisis necessitated a delay ( septel ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The regulators explained that a formal invitation would help them to justify GOB funding of their trip to their superiors . 
This would be their first formal trip to see foreign aviation regulation authorities since taking office in March 2006. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) [ORG ANAC  ] was formally inaugurated in a March 20 ceremony in [LOC Brasilia  ] and replaces the [ORG Department of Civil Aviation  ] ( [ORG DAC  ] ) , subsuming all responsibilities for regulations , authorizations and registrations . 
[ORG ANAC  ] will also take over the duties of certifying aircraft , currently performed by the [ORG Aerospace Technical Center  ] ( [ORG CTA  ] ) in the [ORG Air Force Command  ] .
