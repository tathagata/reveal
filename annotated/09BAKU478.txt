( C ) " [LOC Iran  ] view from [LOC Baku  ] " is the first in an occasional series from Embassy [ORG Baku Iran  ] Watcher that will report on short and/or partially documented items of interest to [LOC Iran  ] information consumers , but not necessarily warranting separate cables . 
This cable includes information on reported increasing security problems in [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Baluchistan  ] , including alleged disruption of [MISC Iran-Pakistan  ] railroad links ; a message from a senior [ORG GOAJ  ] military offical about the dangers of stirring up [MISC Iranian  ] minorities ; the apparent quadrupling in first quarter 2009 ( compared to first quarter 2008 ) seizures in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] of [MISC Iranian-  ] transited heroin ; and skepticism about [MISC Iranian  ] gas export contracts , related by industry participants at the recently-completed [ORG Baku Oil  ] and Gas show . 
End Summary . 
[MISC Baluchi  ] Violence Obstructing [MISC Iran-Pakistan  ] [ORG Rail Link  ] ? --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Several [MISC Iranian  ] contacts , including apolitical businessmen , have told [ORG Baku Iran  ] watcher that the recent suicide bombing of a [LOC Sh'ia  ] mosque , and subsequent attack on a campaign center in [LOC Zahedan  ] , reflect a surge in [MISC Baluchi  ] violence in the border area and inside [LOC Pakistan  ] that has been building steadily over several years . 
According to one source , the [MISC Iranian  ] security forces may be losing effective control over growing areas in the countryside . 
All noted that the rising violence in [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Baluchistan  ] is mirrored and influenced by similar events on the [MISC Pakistani  ] side of the border ( recently described in ref ( a ) ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) One alleged result is the apparent postponement of completion of the long-planned improved rail link between [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC Iran  ] , designed to run through or near [MISC Baluchi  ] territory on both sides of the border . 
The current rail connection , running between [LOC Quetta  ] , [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC Zahedan  ] , [LOC Iran  ] is in poor condition and has low freight-carrying capacity . 
Moreover , according to reports it has recently been repeatedly subject to rocket attacks and other disruption by [MISC Baluchi  ] tribes . 
An improved link also traversing [MISC Iranian  ] and [MISC Pakistani Baluchi  ] areas was originally supposed to have been inaugurated in March , 2009 , with container train service beginning in August . 
According to [MISC Iranian  ] sources in [LOC Baku  ] , this deadline is unlikely to be achieved , and regular use of the [MISC Iran-Pakistan  ] railway for significant cargo shipment is unlikely in the foreseeable future. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) xxxxxxxxxxxx quoted the Ministry source as saying that in 2008 [LOC Iran  ] asked [LOC Pakistan  ] to establish a new , " more secure and modern " route , but that [LOC Pakistan  ] has so far refused . 
The source added that [LOC Tehran  ] is rife with rumors about the increasing lack of safety in [MISC Baluchi  ] areas , and claimed that many guard and police posts in [LOC Sistan-Baluchistan  ] areas are no longer occupied at night due to the increased danger of attack. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Another source , xxxxxxxxxxxx blamed the [MISC Ahmadinejad  ] administration for pursuing provocative anti-Sunni practices ( including harassment of [MISC Sunni  ] clergy and congregations and raids on [MISC Sunni  ] mosques ) and other " arrogant " crackdowns over the last few years . 
He claimed that these practices , combined with high unemployment , perceived discrimination , [LOC Baku  ] 00000478 002.2 of 003 SUBJECT: [LOC IRAN  ] VIEW FROM BAKU: VIOLENCE IN [MISC BALUCHISTAN REDUCING BORDER SECURITY  ] ; GOAJ OFFICIAL WARNS AGAINST MANIPULATION OF IRAN’S MINORITIES ; [LOC IRAN  ] TRANSIT-ORIGIN HEROIN SEIZURES RISE ; ALLEGED PROBLEMS WITH [MISC IRANIAN GAS EXPORT DEALS  ] and few government services , has increased anger among [MISC Baluchis  ] , and identification of the central government as an " enemy . 
" He cited the appointment of [MISC Ahmadinejad  ] ally [PER Habibullah Dehmordah  ] as a Governor of [LOC Sistan-Baluchistan  ] as a typical insensitive blunder , calling him a " stupid , brutal , [ORG Sunni-hater  ] . 
" ( [PER Note: Dehmordah  ] was replaced as Governor in 2008 by Ali-Mohammed Azad .

[ORG GOAJ Military Figure Opposes Promoting Unrest in Iran  ] --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) At a 12 May meeting with a visiting group of 16 [LOC U.S.  ] military general officers , the [ORG GOAJ 's Special Assistant  ] to the President for [MISC Defense  ] , General [PER Vahid Aliyev  ] , related that he had recently met in [MISC Iranian  ] [LOC Azerbaijan  ] with ( unnamed ) high-ranking &Iranian [MISC General.8 Although  ] he did not provide details , [PER Aliyev  ] strongly implied that the [MISC Iranian  ] General raised alleged " foreign-sponsored " efforts to foment unrest among [MISC Iranian  ] ethnic groups , including [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Azerbaijanis  ] ( who make up nearly thirty percent of the [MISC Iranian  ] population ) . 
Commenting on this issue , [PER Aliyev  ] asserted that " there have been four attempts by [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Azerbaijanis  ] to assert autonomy in the last hundred years , all of which were crushed " by the [MISC Iranian  ] state . 
As an example , [PER Aliyev  ] cited the [MISC Soviet  ] effort during [MISC World War II  ] to establish a breakaway " [LOC Republic  ] of [LOC South Azerbaijan  ] . 
" The [MISC Soviets  ] forces pulled back in 1946 , after a " [MISC Truman-Stalin Agreement  ] , " which [PER Aliyev  ] depicted as a cynical " betrayal " of collaborating [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Azerbaijanis  ] . 
He recounted that the resulting repression by [LOC Tehran  ] resulted in the deaths of 60,000 [MISC Azeris  ] , and the flight of many more into [MISC Soviet  ] [LOC Azerbaijan.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) [LOC U.S.  ] military participants agreed that [PER Aliyev  ] appeared to be implicitly signaling that outside fomenting of unrest in [LOC Iranian Azerbaijan  ] is opposed by the [ORG GOAJ  ] . 
[PER Aliyev  ] similarly told the [LOC U.S.  ] officers that any foreign war with [LOC Iran  ] will be bad for [LOC Azerbaijan  ] , and result in a flood of refugees entering the country . 
( [PER Note:  ] The three other " failed [MISC Azerbaijani  ] autonomy struggles " cited by [PER Aliyev  ] presumably refer to the early 20th century Constitutional Revolution , [MISC Azerbaijani  ] resistance to [PER Reza Shah  ] 's centralization policies in the 1920 's , and efforts by senior [MISC Azerbaijani  ] clerics and activists to obtain local autonomy in the wake of the [MISC Islamic  ] Revolution in 1979 .

[ORG GOAJ  ] [MISC Iran-Origin  ] Heroin Seizures Continue Rise --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) According to xxxxxxxxxxxx , export of narcotics from [LOC Iran  ] into [LOC Azerbaijan  ] continue to skyrocket ( see ref b ) . 
According to statistics provided to [ORG Baku Iran  ] watcher xxxxxxxxxxxx , [MISC Iran-origin  ] heroin seizures ( i.e. , heroin derived from [LOC Afghani  ] and [MISC Pakistani  ] opium that entered [LOC Azerbaijan  ] from [LOC Iran  ] ) in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] nearly quadrupled during the first quarter of 2009 , as compared to the first quarter of 2008 . 
According to the [ORG GOAJ  ] , virtually all of this heroin had been fully processed in labs and was " ready for market . 
" Total heroin seizures in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] during the first quarter of 2008 reflected a sharp increase over the first quarter of 2007 ; while in 2006 only twenty kilograms of such heroin was officially reported seized in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] during the entire year . 
In contrast , reported [ORG GOAJ  ] seizures of [MISC Iran-origin  ] heroin during the first quarter of 2009 amounted to nearly 59,000 kilos , as compared to approximately 15,000 kilos of heroin seized in the first quarter of 2008 . 
Projected Problems in [MISC Iranian  ] Gas Links --------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The annual [ORG Baku Oil  ] and Gas Show , held June 2-5 , brought a variety of energy company executives and pundits to [LOC Baku  ] , though no senior officials from [LOC Iran  ] . 
An [MISC American  ] [LOC Baku  ] 00000478 003.2 of 003 SUBJECT: [LOC IRAN  ] VIEW FROM BAKU: VIOLENCE IN [MISC BALUCHISTAN REDUCING BORDER SECURITY  ] ; [ORG GOAJ  ] OFFICIAL WARNS AGAINST MANIPULATION OF IRAN’S MINORITIES ; [LOC IRAN  ] TRANSIT-ORIGIN HEROIN SEIZURES RISE ; ALLEGED PROBLEMS WITH [MISC IRANIAN GAS EXPORT DEALS  ] interlocutor told [ORG Baku Iran  ] Watcher on the side of the show that xxxxxxxxxxxx had confided to him in a private conversation xxxxxxxxxxxx that he viewed near-term implementation of the [MISC Iranian-Pakistani  ] gas link project as " very unlikely . 
" The downbeat comment by the xxxxxxxxxxxx was made despite the recent signing in [LOC Istanbul  ] by President [MISC Ahmadinejad  ] and President [PER Zardari  ] of an [MISC Iranian-Pakistani  ] MOU committing to the gas project . 
According to this source , xxxxxxxxxxxx indicated that he had several reasons for this opinion , but the only one he elaborated was that " the [MISC Pakistanis  ] don't have the money to pay for either the pipeline , or the gas . 
" <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Meanwhile , during a panel discussion at the conference on the future prospects of [MISC Caspian  ] gas , several commentators noted the difficulty of doing business in " unpredictable , overly bureaucratic " [LOC Iran  ] , and the alleged historical " unreliability " of [MISC Iranian  ] gas supply contracts previously reached with [LOC Turkey  ] and [LOC Turkmenistan  ] . 
For example , panelists recounted that , after long negotiations , [LOC Iran  ] has four times failed to sign separate Liquid national Gas contracts at the last minute . 
Two panelists claimed that [LOC Iran  ] has repeatedly diverted gas supplies to meet domestic needs , thereby interrupting its contractual gas exports - and has not paid contractual penalties for these violations. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) xxxxxxxxxxxx asserted bluntly that [MISC Iranian  ] political leaders are totally focused on domestic needs and personal jockeying , and are simply not interested in hearing about the value of optimizing foreign gas exports . 
The only exception , he claimed , is their interest in the notional prospect of annually exporting ten billion cubic meters ( bcms ) of gas to [LOC Europe  ] . 
He attributed this interest to a conviction that such a deal will significantly increase [LOC Iran  ] 's political leverage in [LOC Europe  ] and substantially insulate it from future [MISC European  ] pressure - a perception he characterized as revealing , and " typically " unrealistic .
