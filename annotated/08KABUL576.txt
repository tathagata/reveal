( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Summary: Since  ] the tragic suicide attack on the [ORG Baghlan Sugar Factory  ] on November 6 , 2007 , the central government has replaced two leading provincial officials and has increased pressure on [ORG Afghan National Security Forces  ] ( [ORG ANSF  ] ) to combat organized crime and insurgent activity . 
[LOC Baghlan  ] is stable and relatively secure , and traffic continues to flow along the [LOC Ring Road  ] and to reach the northern and western provinces . 
Industry is the basis for economic development in the province . 
It remains to be seen whether the young , newly-appointed and politically-inexperienced governor is able to assert his office 's authority . 
Security - Fall Out from the [ORG Baghlan Sugar Factory Bombing  ] --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The attack on the [ORG Baghlan Sugar Factory  ] , in which approximately 75 individuals died , shook the provincial government . 
President [PER Karzai  ] eventually succumbed to pressure from Parliament and replaced the provincial governor and [ORG National Directorate of Security  ] ( [ORG NDS  ] ) provincial chief . 
Both the provincial police chief , who was in [LOC Kabul  ] at a police conference at the time of the bombing , and his deputy have retained their positions. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Police and [ORG NDS  ] recently conducted an operation targeting organized criminals and insurgents in the province . 
More than 120 individuals surrendered , likely motivated by previous overnment operations that caused casualties . 
Among the detained individuals were seven criinals accused of providing material support for he attack on the sugar factory. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Given the geographic distances between the provincial capital and outlying district centers and its limited number of personnel , the [ORG ANSF  ] is reliant upon local elders and communities to maintain stability . 
The [LOC Andarab  ] belt in southeastern [LOC Baghlan  ] , the [LOC Qandahari  ] belt west of the river , and the border region between [LOC Kunduz  ] and [LOC Baghlan  ] remain areas of concern due to insurgents , organized crime , and ethnic tension . 
The [ORG ANSF  ] permanent presence has decreased since the abolishment of the highway police and the consolidation of the auxiliary police in [LOC Mazar-e Sharif  ] , [LOC Balkh  ] province . 
( Neither [LOC Baghlan  ] nor [LOC Balkh  ] was ever authorized auxiliary police ) . 
The [MISC Afghan  ] army does not currently have a permanent presence in the province , although one battalion from the 209 Corps , 2nd Brigade , which will soon be established in [LOC Kunduz  ] , is expected to deploy to [LOC Pol-e Khomri  ] , the capital of [LOC Baghlan.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The provincial police chief , [PER Maulana Syed Khili  ] , is a [MISC Tajik  ] who is a former jihadi and [ORG Afghan National Army  ] commander from [ORG Parwan  ] province . 
He served as [ORG Parwan  ] 's provincial police chief for two years before arriving in [LOC Baghlan  ] in 2007 . 
[PER Khili  ] is a fighter with a flair for self-promotion and understands the need to demonstrate results , especially to foreign audiences . 
The recently-arrived provincial [ORG NDS  ] chief [PER Mohammed Daoud  ] is a [MISC Tajik  ] originally from [LOC Kunduz  ] province . 
His brother-in-law , [PER Mir Alam  ] , is a former mujahideen commander , a local power broker , and most recently , [LOC Baghlan  ] 's provincial police chief , who was removed through the rank reform process . 
Development - Industrial Towns , [ORG Hydro-electric Power  ] and Jitters about Privatization --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) A drive from [LOC Kunduz  ] o [LOC Pol-e Khomri  ] highlights [LOC Baghlan  ] 's industrial focus . 
Along the route are sugar and cheese factories in [LOC Fabrica  ] , a cement plant and coal mine in [LOC Pol-e Khomri  ] , hydro-electric plants along the river , and trucks exiting the [MISC Salang Pass  ] enroute to [LOC Mazar-e Sharif  ] and [LOC Kunduz  ] and to [LOC Uzbekistan  ] , [LOC Turkmenistan  ] and [LOC Tajikistan  ] . 
While there have been initiatives to strengthen or rehabilitate the industrial concerns , current development efforts are focused on priority sectors such as education and health and reaching some of the more remote or potentially volatile districts such as [PER Tala Wa Barfek  ] , [PER Deh-e Salah  ] , [PER Pal-e Hazar  ] and [PER Baghlan-e Jedid.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) A [MISC Soviet-style  ] command economy ( state-driven investment , government factories ) remains the textbook approach to economic development in the minds of some provincial officials . 
The [ORG Provincial Council  ] is very skeptical of privatization , influenced by their experiences with the [LOC Baghlan  ] cement plant . 
( The privatization process was poorly handled and is widely viewed has having been corrupt ) . 
They expressed concern about the loss of jobs , as well as the political and economic influences of the [PER Karzai  ] family ( President Karzais brother is CEO of the plant ) . 
The [ORG PC  ] 's exprience with the cement plant has tainted their view as to the importance of private sector development to economic growth . 
Governance - A Financially Savvy , but Politically Inexperienced , Governor --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Governance in the province has suffered with the frequent rotation of governors ( there have been four since 2005 ) . 
The new [LOC Baghlan  ] governor , [PER Abdul Jabar Haqbeen  ] , assumed office at the beginning of January 2008 . 
He is from [LOC Baghlan  ] 's [LOC Nahreen  ] district and graduated from [ORG Kabul University 's Economics Faculty  ] . 
He began his career in the banking sector in [LOC Kabul  ] , before serving most recently as a finance officer in [LOC Baghlan  ] and [LOC Kunduz  ] . 
He is allied with the [ORG Melat  ] party , and his patron in [LOC Kabul  ] is Finance Minister [PER Ahadi  ] . 
[PER Haqbeen  ] 's youth ( he is 30 ) and his lack of political experience may challenge his stated goals o bringing ethnic harmony , security and projects to the province . 
[PER Haqbeen  ] 's mixed [MISC Tajik/Pashtun  ] parentage , however , may assist him in representing the various ethnicities and regional geographic interests. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Tajiks , [MISC Pashtuns  ] , [MISC Uzbeks  ] , and [PER Hazara  ] are represented in [LOC Baghlan  ] 's [ORG PC  ] , although there is a slight [MISC Tajik  ] overrepresentation compared to the population . 
Three [ORG PC  ] members are mullahs . 
The [ORG PC  ] chairman is the charming and well-spoken [PER Mawlawi Sirajudin Seerat  ] , who tends to be critical of the [PER Karzai  ] government . 
The [ORG PC  ] is concerned with maximizing donor assistance and articulating the population 's concerns about job opportunities and security. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The mayor of [LOC Pol-e Khomri  ] , [PER Mohammad Safar  ] , is originally from [LOC Baghlan  ] 's [LOC Farang  ] district . 
He graduated from [ORG Kabul University  ] 's engineering faculty and worked in a variety of government offices and state-owned enterprises before becoming mayor in July 2007 . 
[PER Safar  ] has focused on municipal service delivery and has a budget of approximately USD 1 million . 
He is particularly focused on paving the city 's streets . 
Following a recent fire in the city , he requested international assistance with the procurement of fire fighting equipment . 
( Several municipalities in northeast [LOC Afghanistan  ] have requested assistance in this regard .
