( U ) In a recent courtesy call , [LOC Consul General  ] ( CG ) sought the views of Dom [PER Odilo Pedro Scherer  ] , Archbishop of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , on a range of issues in [LOC Brazil  ] 's political life and on the role of the Church in [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Latin America  ] . 
Dom [PER Odilo  ] , who replaced Cardinal [PER Claudio Hummes  ] in late April , and who will himself be elevated to the [ORG College of Cardinals  ] next month , commentedthat the [PER Pope  ] 's five-day visit to [LOC Sao Paulo  ] in My ( ref A ) was " short but intense . 
" In reality , e said , there are two [PER Popes  ] , the media [PER Pope  ] and he real one . 
[PER Pope Benedict  ] is much different in prson than his public image would suggest , he added , much warmer and more personable and engaging. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Addressing issues facing the Church in [MISC Bazil  ] and the region , Archbishop [PER Scherer  ] noted tht attendance at Sunday Mass , though still low , hs increased in recent years , though the shortage of clergy remains a problem . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] laws prohibiting public subsidies to religious education make it difficult to sustain [MISC Catholic  ] schools ; these schools can offer quality education , he noted , but because their cost per student is higher , poor families cannot afford to send their children to [MISC Catholic  ] schools . 
Liberation theology has lost some of its force and meaning in recent years and no longer poses a serious problem , in [PER Scherer  ] 's view . 
On the other hand , the growth of evangelical movements in [LOC Brazil  ] and elsewhere in the region is of concern . 
Many [MISC Catholics  ] leave the Church to join evangelical congregations , he said , in part because the Church has failed in its mission to deepen people 's faith and strengthen their sense of belonging to the [MISC Church.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) The Archbishop , who served previously as Secretary-General of the [ORG National Conference of  ] [MISC Brazilian  ] Bishops ( [ORG CNBB  ] ) , stressed that the Church does not have a political mission . 
It is not affiliated with any political party and does not embrace any ideology . 
It acts rather as a moral and ethical force in society . 
The challenge , he said , is to make its voice heard . 
Mainstream media , at least in [LOC Brazil  ] , tend to silence the Church , he asserted , not out of a censorship mentality but because of market forces ; the Church 's message is not perceived as likely to sell advertising or improve ratings , so it is sometimes ignored or buried . 
This requires the Church to find its own modes and vehicles of expression as a public voice . 
Contrast this , he suggested , with " [ORG Rede Record  ] , " a television network established and owned by Bishop [PER Edir Macedo  ] , founder and leader of the Universal Church of the [MISC Kingdom of God  ] ( [ORG IURD  ] in [MISC Portuguese  ] ) , [LOC Brazil  ] 's largest [MISC Pentecostal  ] organization . 
Founded in 1989 , [ORG Rede Record  ] recently passed SBT to become [LOC Brazil  ] 's second-largest TV network in terms of audience , after the mammoth [ORG Rede Globo  ] . 
Earlier this month , [ORG TV Record  ] launched " Record News , " [LOC Brazil  ] 's first 24-hour news channel . 
In [PER Scherer  ] 's view , the network operates as commercial enterprise but also serves as a vehicle to advance the interests of the [MISC Pentecostal  ] church in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
According to press reports , the Universal Church buys 300 million Reals ( about USD 160 million ) of programming from TV Record. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) In addition to its social and pastoral work with the poor , the elderly , prisoners , and other marginalized individuals and groups , the Church is active in combating public corruption , Archbishop [PER Scherer  ] said . 
It is not clear whether corruption in [LOC Brazil  ] has increased in recent years ; more likely , he averred , more corruption comes to light because vigilance has increased . 
More wrongdoers are exposed by the media or identified by the police and are tried , convicted , and punished . 
Increasingly , public figures who trumpet their morals are found to be corrupt . 
Of yet more concern is the corruption found in the justice system , because it undermines people 's trust in democratic institutions . 
Here again , though , there has been a marked increase in investigations of judges . 
Corruption , he said , is less tolerated than it used to be. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Asked about " [MISC Bolsa Familia  ] " ( BF ) , the [PER Lula administration  ] 's flagship conditional cash transfer program for the poor , Dom [PER Odilo  ] said the initiative has had contradictory effects . 
On the plus side , the cash stipend concretely helps very poor families and causes more money to circulate in impoverished communities and funds small initiatives . 
If families meet the conditions - keeping their children in school and ensuring they get their vaccinations - it could also have long-term benefits . 
However , in some cases the monthly stipends foster dependency on the part of recipients . 
Worse yet , the program 's close association with the federal government and ruling party has turned it into an electoral instrument , distorting the political system. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) Comment: Archbishop [PER Scherer  ] - slated to become a Cardinal next month - presides over the world 's third largest [MISC Catholic  ] archdiocese , a metropolitan area of significant economic and political clout which also suffers from extensive poverty , violent crime , and other social ills . 
The Church , which was widely recognized during and after the military dictatorship for its important role in defending human rights and advocating for democracy , has lost some of its political stature in recent years , but remains a relevant opinion leader on the challenges facing contemporary [MISC Brazilian  ] society .
