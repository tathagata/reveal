( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Summary:  ] The [MISC Dutch  ] soldiers and civilians currently posted at the [MISC Dutch-led  ] [ORG PRT Uruzgan  ] are the strongest advocates for continued [MISC Dutch  ] presence in [LOC Afghanistan  ] after August 2010 . 
They attempt to influence their many visitors and policy makers in The [ORG Hague  ] by focusing on the positive impact of [MISC Dutch  ] efforts in [LOC Uruzgan  ] . 
Though they are often frustrated that the true impact of [MISC Dutch  ] efforts is not resonating with the home audience , they continue to lobby in the hopes of retaining some type of [MISC Dutch  ] footprint beyond next summer . 
Though their new approach of including [MISC Afghan  ] officials in briefings appears to be having a positive impact , the [MISC Dutch  ] civilians in [LOC Afghanistan  ] believe the chance of a large [MISC Dutch  ] presence beyond summer 2010 is low . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Task Force Uruzgan  ] ( [ORG TFU  ] ) and the adjoining [ORG Provincial Reconstruction Team  ] ( [ORG PRT  ] ) receive many visitors from The [ORG Hague  ] . 
Catering to anything from journalists to royalty , [MISC Dutch  ] military and diplomatic officers provide detailed briefs on how the [MISC Dutch  ] Three-D approach ( defense , diplomacy and development ) has yielded tangible results in one of the most impoverished and conservative provinces in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[MISC Dutch  ] civilians say that nearly all of their visitors walk away from their brief time in [LOC Uruzgan  ] with a new found respect for the mission , even the many who arrive as critics of continued [MISC Dutch  ] involvement in [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) For example , the [ORG Task Force Commander  ] and civilian representatives described the recent visit of [MISC Dutch  ] Minister of [LOC Interior  ] and [LOC Kingdom Relations  ] and senior [ORG Labor Party  ] member [ORG Gussje  ] ter [PER Horst  ] as very successful . 
( Note: The [ORG Dutch Labor Party  ] has argued most adamantly to withdraw [MISC Dutch  ] troops from [LOC Uruzgan  ] by the stated August 2010 deadline . 
End Note . 
) Privately , [MISC Dutch  ] civilians at the [ORG PRT  ] are frustrated that these ostensibly successful visits have not resonated back in the [LOC Netherlands  ] , and have not , therefore , guaranteed public or official support for continued [MISC Dutch  ] involvement in [LOC Uruzgan  ] . 
[MISC Dutch  ] soldiers and civilians stationed in [LOC Uruzgan  ] are very passionate and boastful when describing the achievements they and their predecessors have made here . 
As one [MISC Dutchman  ] put it , if every citizen of the [LOC Netherlands  ] could somehow visit the [MISC TFU/PRT  ] , there would be little debate on the matter of withdrawing in August 2010 . 
[ORG Afghans Voices Make  ] the [ORG Point  ] ----------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Recent briefings of [MISC Dutch  ] visitors have featured [MISC Afghans  ] pleading for the [MISC Dutch  ] to stay , possibly with some coaching by the [MISC Dutch  ] based at the [ORG PRT  ] . 
At the conclusion of the visit of Defense Minister [LOC Middlekoop  ] , the acting [ORG Civilian Representative  ] [PER Jean-Wilhelm Beaujean  ] reported that [LOC Uruzgan  ] Governor [PER Hamdam  ] and the [LOC Chora District Chief  ] [PER Mohammad Daudhad  ] had been word perfect in their messaging to the minister , particularly that [MISC Afghans  ] want the [MISC Dutch  ] to stay , that the [MISC Dutch  ] are achieving more than other coalition partners in [LOC Uruzgan  ] , and that NGOs will find it difficult to continue operating in [LOC Uruzgan  ] if the [MISC Dutch  ] leave . 
The Minister reportedly told [PER Beaujean  ] he agreed with the messages . 
[PER Beaujean  ] quietly told [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG PRT  ] rep later , I see our talking points are finally starting to work , and that once again we sold the mission in a good way. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Even more indicative that [MISC Afghan  ] voices are having a positive impact in the debate was a recent [ORG Financial Times  ] interview of Governor [PER Hamdam  ] received wide coverage in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
In the November 23 piece , Governor [PER Hamdam  ] reiterated The people of [LOC Uruzgan  ] are very familiar with the [MISC Dutch  ] ) they have spent a lot of time here ) and they are asking them to stay . 
If they do leave , it will mean they are going at an important time with their job only half finished. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Civilian  ] representatives at the current [ORG TFU  ] rotation in [LOC Uruzgan  ] have also been pressing for internationalization of the [ORG PRT  ] , which they see as important for optics more than increased capacity . 
For example , [PER Beaujean  ] 's efforts to gain additional civilians from the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Australia  ] appear to be driven by his personal opinion [LOC KABUL  ] 00003963 002 OF 002 that [MISC Dutch  ] policy makers might find a continued [MISC Dutch  ] presence more palatable if there is international participation . 
Likely Scenarios after Summer 2010 ----------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In confidence , [MISC Dutch  ] diplomats have said that a large military presence in the province past August 2010 is highly unlikely . 
One [MISC Dutch  ] diplomat reported that logistics teams are already gearing up for the withdrawal , as some 80 large semi-trucks are being prepared to move critical [MISC Dutch  ] military equipment out of the province via land routes . 
The debate now , they reported , is focused on whether or not to retain the [ORG PRT  ] and what form their involvement in the [ORG PRT  ] would take . 
Some [MISC Dutch  ] diplomats believe that coordinating national caveats and operational styles could be next to impossible if the [LOC U.S.  ] takes command of the battle space and a [MISC Dutch  ] civilian continues to lead the [ORG PRT  ] . 
Therefore , they believe the [MISC Dutch  ] will propose that a small cadre of [MISC Dutch  ] development officers remain in [LOC Uruzgan  ] , but under [LOC U.S.  ] leadership . 
Others believe differences could be easily resolved if the right personalities were in place in [LOC Uruzgan  ] , allowing the [MISC Dutch  ] to retain a relatively larger [MISC Dutch  ] presence. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Comment: [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG PRT  ] personnel are not optimistic about the prospects for maintaining a large [MISC Dutch  ] military presence in [LOC Uruzgan  ] , but are doing their best to convince The [ORG Hague  ] of the benefits of doing so . 
[LOC U.S.  ] Representative to the [ORG PRT  ] will continue to urge [MISC Dutch  ] colleagues to maintain their mandate and vital role in coalition efforts , per reftel .
