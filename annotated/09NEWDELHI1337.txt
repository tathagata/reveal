He stressed his desire to expand the bilateral military relationship despite minor irritants , and expressed his hope that [MISC Jones’  ] visit to [LOC India  ] would further the relationship . 
[PER Antony  ] mentioned joint development and production , and technology transfers as meriting focus , adding that the [MISC Indians  ] find [LOC U.S.  ] technology transfer conditions too restrictive . 
[PER Jones  ] and [PER Burleigh  ] urged completion of the [ORG End-Use Monitoring  ] agreement . 
[PER Antony  ] said it needed to be defensible to Parliament , musing that he himself is accountable to parliament and to [MISC India’s  ] vibrant and multi-party democracy. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Jones  ] declared to [PER Antony  ] that he is very encouraged by the overall direction of the bilateral relationship , especially after having met Prime Minister [PER Manmohan Singh  ] who had expressed his optimism for [MISC U.S.-India  ] relations . 
[PER Jones  ] told [PER Antony  ] the [LOC U.S.  ] is in complete agreement with the Prime Minister’s vision , emphasizing that President [PER Obama  ] is also equally committed to strong ties between the two nations. “There is real intent to follow the vision of our national leaders , ” [PER Jones  ] noted .

Success in [LOC Afghanistan  ] Critical ---- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Antony  ] told [ORG Jones India  ] has a stake in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , reminding him that [MISC India’s  ] borders before partition extended to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The [MISC Indian  ] military is concerned by the situation in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Antony  ] admitted , and stressed that the international community’s operations there must succeed because the [LOC India  ] cannot imagine for a moment a [MISC Taliban  ] takeover of its “extended neighbor.” [ORG Pakistan: Infiltration Continues/Trust Deficit Remains  ] ---- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) After the conversation moved to [LOC Pakistan  ] , General [PER Deepak Kapoor  ] , Chief of [ORG Army Staff  ] , interjected and told [PER Jones  ] the [MISC Pakistani  ] military’s statements regarding the [MISC Indian  ] threat on its eastern border are wholly without merit . 
Even after the 11/26 terrorist strikes on [LOC Mumbai  ] , he emphasized , [LOC India  ] did not make any move of a threatening nature toward [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[PER Kapoor  ] alleged that there are 43 terrorist camps in [LOC Pakistan  ] , 22 of which are located in Pakistan-administered [LOC Kashmir  ] . 
Although the [MISC Pakistanis  ] raided some camps in the wake of 11/26 , [PER Kapoor  ] averred , some camps have reinitiated operations . 
[PER Kapoor  ] further asserted infiltration across the [LOC Line of Control  ] cannot occur unless there is some kind of assistance and/or degree of support that is institutional in nature . 
He described several incidents of infiltration that occurred this year , including that of 40 terrorists in March who were found possessing significant ammunition and other equipment . 
[LOC India  ] is worried , [PER Kapoor  ] said , that some part of the huge [LOC U.S.  ] military package to [LOC Pakistan  ] will find its way to the hands of terrorists targeting [LOC India  ] . 
Furthermore , if “we can catch them ( the infiltrators ) , why can’t the [MISC Pakistani  ] military ? ” [PER Kapoor  ] asked. “There’s a trust deficit between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] but there’s also one between [LOC India  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] , ” he stressed. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) [PER Jones  ] asked [PER Kapoor  ] how the [MISC Pakistanis  ] react when the [MISC Indians  ] confront them with these incidents . 
[PER Kapoor  ] replied the [MISC Pakistanis  ] remain in denial mode , but fortunately today [MISC India’s  ] counter-infiltration posture is stronger than in the past . 
Asked about the percentage of infiltrators that get through , [PER Kapoor  ] estimated between 15 to 20 percent but cited the challenge posed by [MISC India’s  ] open border with [LOC Nepal  ] . 
He asserted that at least 16 terrorists this year entered [LOC India  ] through [LOC Nepal  ] and then traveled to [LOC Kashmir  ] . 
Throughout his remarks , [PER Kapoor  ] stressed that infiltration bids were “acts of aggression.” <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) [PER Jones  ] queried [PER Kapoor  ] on prospects of upgrading [MISC Indo-Pak  ] military talks to discuss these issues . 
[PER Kapoor  ] rhetorically asked whether there should not be a degree of confidence in [LOC Pakistan  ] before such a dialogue can even begin . 
[PER Antony  ] interjected that unless there is some tangible follow-up action by [LOC Pakistan  ] against the perpetrators of the 11/26 attacks , discussions with [LOC Pakistan  ] will be difficult . 
Regarding terrorist camps in [LOC Pakistan  ] , [PER Jones  ] told [PER Antony  ] and [PER Kapoor  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] will take up the issue with [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
Regional Problems Require Regional Solutions ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Jones  ] suggested regional problems require regional solutions , underscoring the need for all of us to move forward on a broader strategy by building confidence and trust . 
The [MISC U.S.-India  ] partnership is very important in this context . 
The worst thing for the region would be another 11/26-type attack , [PER Jones  ] stressed , and that we cannot let the terrorists play us off against each other . 
He concluded by underscoring President Obama’s desire to stimulate the bilateral relationship and the [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to working as honestly as possible to share information with [LOC India  ] on security matters. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 .
