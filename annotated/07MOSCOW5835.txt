End Summary. ------------------------------------------- OPTIMISTIC ON ROSNEFT'S FUTURE , [ORG BAP  ] AND [ORG CPC  ] ------------------------------------------- 2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In a December 13th meeting with the Ambassador , [PER Bogdanchikov  ] focused on [ORG Rosneft  ] 's performance , optimistically outlining the company 's operations and future . 
[PER Bogdanchikov  ] claimed [ORG Rosneft  ] 's 10% organic growth ( growth excluding acquisitions ) in oil production in 2007 was among the best rates in the industry world-wide , and he expected 7-8% organic growth in 2008 . 
The company is replacing over 100% of reserves and that its large Vankor field has proven bigger than expected . 
He said production from Vankor will begin in 2008 , despite construction delays on the [ORG East Siberian Pacific Ocean  ] ( [ORG ESPO  ] ) pipeline . 
Since Vankor will be connected to the [ORG Transneft  ] system , it would not require [ORG ESPO  ] until 2010 , when Vankor production would exceed current [ORG Transneft  ] capacities . 
3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Bogdanchikov  ] said [ORG Rosneft  ] isn't planning further major upstream acquisitions , but that it would consider " attractive " opportunities that arise . 
[ORG Rosneft  ] plans to boost production from the current 100 million tons ( 2 mbd ) to 160 million tons ( 3.2 mbd ) by 2015 . 
[PER Bogdanchikov  ] added that [ORG Rosneft  ] plans to focus more on refining . 
It will sell less crude and process more in its own refineries . 
The company plans to invest $15 billion in refining by 2020 , mostly on acquiring refineries and upgrading its own . 
4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Rosneft  ] , as a shareholder in the [ORG BAP  ] and as a shareholder and user of the [ORG Caspian Pipeline Consortium  ] ( [ORG CPC  ] ) , fully supports construction of the [ORG BAP  ] as well as [ORG CPC  ] expansion . 
According to [PER Bogdanchikov  ] , " the day a final deal is signed on the [ORG BAP  ] is the day a deal will be signed on [ORG CPC  ] expansion . 
" He was optimistic that these deals would be concluded soon , as congestion in the [LOC Bosporous  ] adds costs for all producing companies . 
He predicted that [ORG BAP  ] construction and [ORG CPC  ] expansion could both be completed in 18 months once the agreements are inked. --------------------------------------------- -------- TRANSPORT TARIFFS , SUBSOIL AMENDMENTS , AND [ORG SAKHALIN  ] 1 --------------------------------------------- -------- 5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Bogdanchikov  ] said he believes the [ORG GOR  ] will implement a common pipeline tariff for access to the [ORG Transneft  ] system , which he called more " market oriented , " because it would replace the current differentiated system . 
( Note: A common tariff is considered necessary to fund the [ORG ESPO  ] , whose costs have escalated . 
A common tariff would , in effect , subsidize the [ORG ESPO  ] at the expense of shippers moving oil west . 
) 6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Bogdanchikov  ] was hopeful that anticipated amendments to subsoil legislation would be passed in 2008 , allowing new license auctions and extending the current five-year licenses for off-shore production . 
He also expected that new tax incentives , currently granted for some [ORG East Siberia  ] greenfield developments , would be extended to cover offshore projects . 
He said new license blocks will be complicated to develop and that companies need to get started on them as soon as possible . 
[LOC MOSCOW  ] 00005835 002 OF 002 7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Bogdanchikov  ] was positive about [ORG Rosneft  ] 's partnership with [ORG ExxonMobil  ] in [LOC Sakhalin  ] <a id='par1' href='#par1'>Â¶</a>1 . 
Regarding gas sales out of [ORG Sakhalin  ] 1 , [PER Bogdanchikov  ] said [ORG Rosneft  ] believes that the consortium should seek the best commercial terms , " regardless of to whom or in what market " the gas is sold . 
He suggested , however , that scheduled domestic gas price increases may help resolve the current stalemate with [ORG Gazprom  ] , which insists [ORG Sakhalin  ] 1 gas be sold to it domestically. ------------------------------------ DEBT RESTRUCTURING AND CONSOLIDATION ------------------------------------ 8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Regarding [ORG Rosneft  ] 's vast debt and rumored difficulties in obtaining credit , [PER Bogdanchikov  ] said the company already has an agreement with banks to extend the term of its current $20 billion bridge loan . 
He was " absolutely sure " there would be no problems restructuring its debt on favorable terms . 
He expressed confidence in [LOC U.S.  ] credit markets , noting that " even the [ORG Fed  ] is helping us " keep debt service costs down . 
9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Commenting on rumors of further consolidation in the oil sector , [PER Bogdanchikov  ] said there has been no decision on merging with [ORG Surgutneftegaz  ] , and that [ORG Rosneft  ] is not interested in buying the " [MISC Russian  ] half " of [ORG TNK-BP  ] . 
He claimed that [ORG TNK-BP  ] 's production efficiencies and assets were substantially inferior to [ORG Rosneft  ] 's and that such an investment wouldn't make sense -- " it would be better to drill new wells . 
" On the rumored restructuring of the [ORG Ministry of Industry and Energy  ] , [PER Bogdanchikov  ] said that given the inauguration in the spring , he didn't see time for such changes . 
Although " as an oil man " he would like to see a ministry devoted to energy , he has not seen any preparations for doing so . 
10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In response to the Ambassador 's question about [PER Bogdanchikov  ] entering politics in [LOC Sakhalin Oblast  ] , [PER Bogdanchikov  ] said such suggestions were " totally rumors . 
" He claimed he has never been interested in pursuing political office and plans to stay on at [ORG Rosneft  ] , but did not comment on recent resignations of three of his deputies . 
11 . 
( C ) [PER Bogdanchikov  ] 's depth , vision , and presentation were impressive , as usual . 
His forecast , however , is at odds with conventional wisdom here . 
Most analysts with whom we have spoken believe further consolidation in the [MISC Russian  ] oil sector is inevitable and that , after 10 years at the helm , [PER Bogdanchikov  ] may be on his way out .
