[ORG JON R. PURNELL  ] , FOR REASONS 1.4 ( B , D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: In the last month , several [MISC Uzbek  ] publications have carried articles about the good works of [ORG First Daughter  ] [PER Gulnora Karimova  ] . 
The articles focus on her selfless giving , charity work , and business acumen . 
One , an interview with [MISC Russian  ] scholar [PER Aleksi Malashenko  ] , discusses [PER Gulnora  ] 's chances of replacing her father as president in <a id='par2007' href='#par2007'>¶</a>2007 . 
The discussion of the honest , hardworking [PER Gulnora  ] , looking out for the best interests of her country , likely irks the many business people who have been crushed by [PER Karimova  ] and her greed as well as the general public , who view her as something of a robber baron . 
This media campaign is definitely a move by [PER Karimova  ] to improve her image , possibly as the first step to a 2007 presidential run , but also likely as a means to silence critics within elite [MISC Uzbek  ] circles . 
PATRON OF THE ARTS , CHILDREN AND THE POOR ------------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) On September 1 , [LOC Tasvir  ] , a widely read family magazine , published a two-page article praising [PER Karimova  ] 's donations to schools and orphanages throughout the country . 
As a member of " Women 's Meeting , " an organization charged with the welfare of children , families and the elderly , [PER Gulnora  ] put on a children 's production of the [ORG Lion King  ] in schools in [LOC Samarkand  ] , [LOC Bukhara  ] , [LOC Jizzax  ] , [LOC Gulistan  ] , [LOC Fergana  ] , and [LOC Kokand  ] . 
[PER Gulnora  ] 's personal charity fund , " [PER Mekhr Nuri  ] " ( Lights of Love or Mercy ) also works throughout the regions and has provided furniture and other school supplies to facilities in [LOC Namangan  ] , [LOC Syrdarya  ] , [LOC Kokand  ] , and [LOC Bukhara  ] . 
The youth-movement-run newspaper Kamolot praised [PER Karimova  ] for her role in giving scholarships to under-privileged students under the [ORG Forum of Culture  ] and Art of [LOC Uzbekistan  ] . 
[PER Karimova  ] is chair of this foundation . 
The first Daughter also heads the [ORG Center for Political Studies  ] . 
SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE BUSINESSWOMAN ----------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) An August 18 article , also in [LOC Tasvir  ] , praised [PER Gulnora  ] for her role in upgrading the services of the cellular telephone company [ORG Uzdunrobita  ] . 
According to the article , [LOC Uzdonrobita  ] 's technology was outdated . 
[PER Gulnora  ] then " bought " the company , modernized the equipment and found the right partner , [MISC Russian  ] MTS , to continue key developments . 
( Note: The price MTS paid per subscriber was significantly above the market rate . 
[PER Gulnora  ] , who acquired the company at rock bottom rates , made a considerable sum of money on the transaction . 
End note . 
) In this piece , [PER Gulnora  ] noted that businesses are like precious stones , they only obtain value once they are processed and improved . 
( Comment: This statement likely irks the multitude of business people [PER Gulnora  ] has usurped or put out of business through her government connections . 
Most of these businesses were profitable in their own right , which is what attracted the [ORG First Daughter  ] to them in the first place . 
End comment . 
) STANDING ON HER HIGH MORALS AND PRINCIPLES ------------------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In an interview published on September 8 , [PER Karimova  ] told an [MISC Uzbek  ] paper , [LOC Darakchi  ] that she is a highly principled person who listens to her conscience . 
She stressed that she can't stand treachery or lies . 
She sees herself as open and even-handed , and demands the same from those around her . 
She even went so far as to say that people treat you the way you treat them , and if you don't treat others well , you will " find yourself in a blind alley . 
" ( Comment: The many people crushed by [PER Karimova  ] would likely relish the chance to catch her blind in an alley . 
End comment . 
) THE NEXT PRESIDENT ? ------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) On September 6 , [PER Ferghana.ru  ] published an interview with [MISC Russian  ] professor [PER Aleksi Malashenko  ] in which he discusses the potential of a [PER Gulnora Karimova  ] campaign for president in 2007 . 
While , [PER Malashenko  ] , a member of the [ORG Moscow Carnegie Center  ] and Professor at the [ORG Moscow State Institute of International Relations  ] , noted that [PER Karimova  ] 's chances of becoming president were infinitesimally low because of the scandals surrounding her business ventures , simply mentioning the possible in a public forum raises [PER Garimova  ] 's profile . 
COMMENT: WHAT'S BEHIND THE PRESS CAMPAIGN ? ------------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The unusual series of articles promoting the virtue and selflessness of [PER Gulnora Karimova  ] is likely part of a larger strategy to clean up the [ORG First Daughter  ] 's image . 
Most Uzbeks see [PER Karimova  ] as a greedy , power hungry individual who uses her father to crush business people or anyone else who stands in her way . 
Even with the press campaign to improve her image , [PER Gulnora  ] is continuing to do business , pressuring and shutting down competitors . 
This charm offensive will not likely make her more popular ; she remains the single most hated person in the country . 
( Comment: We have no polling data to support that statement , but we stand by it . 
End comment . 
) The chances of a successful 2007 presidential run for [PER Karimova  ] are slim to none , as neither the people , nor , more importantly , the elite , would support her . 
In addition , it is unlikely that many in this still very conservative culture would accept the idea of a female leader . 
High-level female officials are still tokens , relegated to traditional female issues . 
That said , the political climate is changing rapidly here , and these articles could be a trial balloon .
