End Summary . 
[ORG AWK  ] Nervous but Eager to Share Views ---------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) SCR [PER Ruggiero  ] met with [ORG AWK  ] and Governor [PER Weesa  ] on September 28 in the Governor 's Palace in [LOC Kandahar City  ] . 
The Representative of [LOC Canada  ] in [LOC Kandahar  ] ( [LOC RoCK  ] ) [PER Ben Rowswell  ] also attended the meeting , which was held in a wood-paneled room , beneath a large photo of President [PER Hamid Karzai  ] . 
( Note: While we must deal with [ORG AWK  ] as the head of the [ORG Provincial Council  ] , he is widely understood to be corrupt and a narcotics trafficker . 
End Note ) [ORG AWK  ] , dressed in a crisp white shalwar kameez and pinstriped vest , appeared nervous , though eager to express his views on the international presence in [LOC Kandahar  ] . 
The Importance of Good Governance ------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) SCR emphasized the criticality of good governance in the province , and said the [LOC United States  ] would like to see improvement in the post-election period . 
He said the [LOC United States  ] is ready to work with the [MISC GIRoA  ] to strengthen key provincial and district level governance , but we are only willing to expend our resources in people and programs if we have confidence those resources will pay off and make a real difference. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Both [ORG AWK  ] and [PER Weesa  ] acknowledged there was a credibility gap between the public and the government . 
[PER Weesa  ] said it was a problem that in the 10 months he had been in office , the government had not been able to deliver 24-hour electricity to the people , and that 150 factories had closed because of it . 
He said people looked to [ORG NGOs  ] more than to the government to deliver services , and he complained that [ORG NGOs  ] poach workers from the government by offering higher wages . 
SCR emphasized the importance of naming credible provincial governors and district officials before the inauguration to send a positive signal on good governance to the [MISC Afghan  ] people and the international community. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG AWK  ] suggested one way of fighting corruption in the province would be to re-establish and empower district shuras , instead of judges or police , to settle local disputes . 
Currently there is only one judge for the five districts around [LOC Kandahar City  ] , he said , and a council of local elders would be more effective at resolving land , water and other disputes . 
( Note: there are a total of seven judges for all 17 districts in the province . 
) " You can easily bribe the chief of police or a judge , 8 he said , &but you can't bribe 50 elders . 
" He said the provincial council , with the support of the governor , could initiate the formation of these district shuras , which would consist of 10-15 elders elected by the people . 
[ORG Infrastructure Priorities  ] , Private Security Contractors and Conflicts of Interest --------------------------------------------- ----------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG AWK  ] said he had been in [LOC Kandahar  ] almost continuously since 1992 , and that the [LOC U.S.  ] reputation in the province was built on the back of two key infrastructure projects done in the 1950s and 60s . 
He said what would make a difference to the population today would be similar large-scale , labor-intensive projects that would provide jobs to the people and keep them from being recruited by the [ORG Taliban  ] . 
[ORG AWK  ] cautioned against the use of small scale projects and [LOC KABUL  ] 00003068 002 OF 002 additional cash-for-work programs ; he stated that the use of implementing partners does not allow expenditure of development resources to reach villagers and other local [MISC Afghans  ] . 
Both he and [PER Weesa  ] added that it should be the local elders who are empowered to distribute these jobs , not officials or companies from outside . 
Putting Private Security Under the Direction of the [ORG Provincial Council  ] --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) In the same vein of providing " local solutions to local problems , " as he put it , [ORG AWK  ] recommended a " local solution " to the problem of providing security in the area . 
He said that currently , there are many jihadi commanders with militias who independently provide protection to convoys and projects , but that a proposal before the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] would bring all these commanders under one umbrella in [LOC Kandahar  ] , with one person given the license for the private security sector . 
He said there would be a meeting Wednesday ( September 30 ) of all the security companies , under the auspices of the [ORG Provincial Council  ] , to appoint this representative to send to [LOC Kabul  ] . 
( Note: [ORG AWK  ] is understood to have a stake in private security contracting , and has aggressively lobbied the [MISC Canadians  ] to have his security services retained for the [ORG Dahla Dam  ] refurbishment . 
Both he and the governor have tried to exert control over how contracts are awarded in the province ) all of which could be a significant conflict of interest in the province . 
End Note . 
) Elections: What 's the Point ? --------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) In answer to a question from the [LOC RoCK  ] and the SCR about the credibility of the elections , [ORG AWK  ] said democracy was new for [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and that people in the region did not understand the point of having one election , let alone two . 
" The people do not like change , " he said . 
" They think , the President is alive , and everything is fine . 
Why have an election ? 
" Comment ----- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The meeting with [ORG AWK  ] highlights one of our major challenges in [LOC Afghanistan:  ] how to fight corruption and connect the people to their government , when the key government officials are themselves corrupt . 
Given [ORG AWK  ] 's reputation for shady dealings , his recommendations for large , costly infrastructure projects should be viewed with a healthy dose of skepticism . 
Still , his observations about the unintended consequences of how [ORG NGOs  ] and other international partners do their work , e.g . 
" poaching " of government staff , track with some of our own concerns , including about how to promote [MISC Afghan-led  ] solutions . 
We will continue to urge [ORG AWK  ] to improve his own credibility gap as well as that of the [MISC GIRoA  ] .
