MOORE . 
REASONS: 1.4 ( B , D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) Four government doctors , held by the police [ORG Criminal Investigation Division  ] ( [ORG CID  ] ) since the end of the war in May for allegedly filing false reports on civilian casualties in the [ORG No-Fire Zone  ] during the last several months of the war , were released on bail today . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) The doctors [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] had been pressured to give the press conference held in early July ( reftel ) , where they recanted all the statements they had made from the [MISC No-Fire Zone  ] . 
They said they were heavily coached for the press conference , given specific lines to say , and even practiced with several members of the local media beforehand . 
They said they [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] had not lied when giving their original statements during the war. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) Comment: The release of the four doctors is a welcome step by the [ORG GSL  ] , but clearly they remain under investigation by the [ORG CID  ] and now also are potentially under threat of abduction or extrajudicial killing . 
Post will continue to monitor the situation very closely , but for now the doctors appear to want to maintain as low a profile as possible , without undue attention brought to them either in [LOC Sri Lanka  ] or internationally . 
End Comment .
