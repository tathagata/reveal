Kurtzer  ] ; Reasons: 1.4 ( B ) and ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) SUMMARY: [LOC Israel  ] sees [LOC Iran  ] as the primary threat to its security and sees the enrichment cycle as the " point of no return " for [LOC Tehran  ] 's nuclear weapons program . 
The [ORG GOI  ] believes that diplomatic pressure with teeth , such as sanctions , can affect [MISC Iranian  ] behavior , and is lobbying the [MISC EU-3  ] and [ORG IAEA  ] on details of a permanent suspension agreement . 
The [MISC Israelis  ] support a unified international front but are concerned that the [ORG USG  ] may move toward the [ORG EU  ] position . 
Despite the [ORG GOI  ] 's focus on the diplomatic track , public and private speculation about possible [MISC Israeli  ] air strikes continues . 
In weighing the military options , the [ORG GOI  ] is aware of significant differences from its successful strike against [LOC Iraq  ] 's nuclear program in 1981 , including an uncertain and dispersed target set , the presence of coalition forces in [LOC Iraq  ] and the [LOC Gulf  ] , [MISC Iranian  ] capabilities to retaliate through [ORG Hizballah  ] and terrorism , and the changed strategic environment . 
END SUMMARY. --------------------------------------------- ---------- The [MISC Iranian  ] Threat , " [MISC Point of No Return  ] , " and Timelines --------------------------------------------- ---------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) PM [PER Sharon  ] calls [LOC Iran  ] " the main threat to [LOC Israel  ] " and has recently expressed concern that some states are " getting used to " the idea of [LOC Iran  ] obtaining nuclear weapons . 
Other senior [MISC Israeli  ] officials echo this , cautioning that [LOC Tehran  ] 's nuclear weapons program poses what Mossad Chief [PER Meir Dagan  ] calls an " existential threat " that alters the strategic balance in the region. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In a meeting with congressional visitors in December , Defense Minister [PER Shaul Mofaz  ] described operation of the enrichment cycle as the " point of no return " for the [MISC Iranian  ] program , a view shared by many senior [ORG GOI  ] officials . 
Mossad Chief [PER Dagan  ] went a step further , saying that the [MISC Iranian  ] program will be unstoppable once it no longer requires outside assistance to complete the enrichment process . 
At the technical level , the director for external affairs at the [LOC Israel  ] Atomic [ORG Energy Commission  ] ( [ORG IAEC  ] ) told poloff that the critical step would be [LOC Iran  ] 's operation of a centrifuge enrichment cascade. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG GOI  ] officials have given different timelines for when they believe [LOC Iran  ] will have full enrichment capability . 
In February , PM [PER Sharon  ] told the Secretary that he believes there is still time remaining to pressure [LOC Iran  ] , but that the window of opportunity is closing quickly . 
[PER DefMin Mofaz  ] cautioned that [LOC Iran  ] is " less than one year away , " while the head of research in military intelligence estimated that [LOC Iran  ] would reach this point by early 2007 . 
Technical experts at the [ORG IAEC  ] predicted that [LOC Iran  ] would have enrichment capability within six months of the end of the suspension agreement . 
A few [ORG GOI  ] officials admitted informally that these estimates need to be taken with caution . 
The head of the [ORG MFA  ] 's strategic affairs division recalled that [ORG GOI  ] assessments from 1993 predicted that [LOC Iran  ] would possess an atomic bomb by 1998 at the latest. -------------------------------------------- Focus on Diplomacy and Concern with the [MISC EU-3  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In the near term , [LOC Israel  ] is focused on maintaining diplomatic pressure on [LOC Iran  ] to cooperate with the [ORG IAEA  ] and [MISC EU-3  ] . 
[PER Sharon  ] defines diplomatic pressure to include [ORG UNSC  ] sanctions , e.g. on [LOC Iran  ] 's airlines and trade , as noted below . 
President [PER Katsav  ] has said that [LOC Tehran  ] is " very conscious of international opinion . 
" Other [ORG MFA  ] and [ORG NSC  ] officials point to the current suspension and to [MISC Iranian  ] reaction to the [LOC Mykonos  ] case as proof that diplomatic pressure can affect decision-making in [LOC Tehran.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [MISC Israelis  ] often express disappointment with [MISC EU-3  ] efforts , but see no real alternative at this time . 
PM [PER Sharon  ] told reporters on March 10 that [LOC Iran  ] uses the negotiations to " play for time . 
" In private , [PER Sharon  ] , his [ORG Cabinet  ] , and military leaders have all complained that the [MISC Europeans  ] are " too soft . 
" Similarly , President [PER Katsav  ] has cautioned that [LOC Iran  ] will " cheat " on any commitments it makes . 
[ORG MFA  ] staff told poloff that they do not believe that the [MISC EU-3  ] effort will be successful in obtaining a permanent suspension or that the [MISC Europeans  ] will support effective sanctions against [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG GOI  ] technical experts said they have been lobbying the [MISC Europeans  ] and [ORG IAEA  ] on several issues . 
First , the [ORG GOI  ] would like a clearer and more detailed listing of all activities covered by the suspension , along with timelines for each step . 
Second , they want more robust verification measures and greater focus on [LOC Iran  ] 's denial of access to [ORG IAEA  ] inspectors . 
Third , the [MISC Israelis  ] insist that any final agreement must be endorsed by the [ORG UNSC  ] to ensure that noncompliance will be dealt with at an appropriate level . 
Fourth , [LOC Israel  ] is pushing the [MISC EU-3  ] to define benchmarks that would signal a failure of the process , and to identify the concrete consequences of such failure. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) According to the [ORG IAEC  ] , the [ORG GOI  ] has urged the [MISC Europeans  ] to examine bilateral or [ORG EU  ] sanctions with small , but noticeable , economic impacts . 
After telling the press on March 10 that " it would probably not be advisable to impose an oil embargo on [LOC Iran  ] , " PM [PER Sharon  ] advocated trade and flight restrictions . 
Lower-level [ORG GOI  ] officials said these steps could include restrictions on [MISC Iranians  ] studying in [LOC Europe  ] , limitations on travel by [MISC Iranian  ] scientific personnel , and suspension of landing privileges for [MISC Iranian  ] airlines within the [ORG EU  ] . 
The goal , according to the deputy [ORG NSA  ] for foreign affairs , is unified pressure from the [ORG EU  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , and [LOC U.S.  ] for a " complete , full , verifiable cessation of the fuel cycle program . 
" In the short term , this means a full suspension of all enrichment , reprocessing , heavy-water-reactor construction , and related [ORG R&D activities.  ] --------------------------------------------- -- [MISC Israeli  ] Preference for [ORG USG  ] and [ORG UNSC  ] Involvement --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) In light of their uneasiness with [MISC EU-3  ] efforts , the [MISC Israelis  ] are hoping for robust [LOC U.S.  ] involvement and action by the [ORG UNSC  ] . 
PM [PER Sharon  ] has urged the [MISC EU-3  ] to continue its efforts , but also stressed the importance of preparing to take [LOC Iran  ] to the [ORG UNSC  ] . 
In a meeting with a CoDel on December 12 , [PER DefMin Mofaz  ] pushed for the [LOC U.S.  ] to take the lead with the [MISC Europeans  ] and pursue all diplomatic solutions , including sanctions . 
President [PER Katsav  ] asked the Secretary not to " wait for the [MISC Europeans  ] . 
" <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) This desire for [LOC U.S.  ] activity is amplified by the extremely limited options open to [LOC Israel  ] on the diplomatic front . 
The [ORG IAEC  ] 's director for non-proliferation admitted that the [ORG GOI  ] sees " little we can do " to increase pressure on [LOC Iran  ] as long as [LOC Tehran  ] abides by the suspension agreement . 
The [ORG MFA  ] 's office director for the [LOC Gulf  ] states said that [LOC Israel  ] would maintain its low-profile diplomatic activities , such as supplying [ORG IAEA  ] members with intelligence material related to the [MISC Iranian  ] program . 
She said the [ORG MFA  ] believes that any overt [MISC Israeli  ] pressure would backfire , leading to a surge of [MISC Arab  ] support for [LOC Iran  ] and focusing attention on [LOC Israel  ] 's own nuclear activities. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Following the recent announcements on [LOC Iran  ] by the President and the Secretary , several [MISC Israeli  ] officials asked if the [ORG USG  ] is shifting its policy on [LOC Iran  ] . 
The deputy [ORG NSA  ] for foreign affairs acknowledged that the [LOC U.S.  ] move is probably necessary to build international consensus for taking [LOC Iran  ] to the [ORG UNSC  ] . 
At the same time , he expressed concern that the [ORG USG  ] would be influenced by what he called the [ORG EU  ] 's habit of granting concessions to [LOC Iran  ] prior to full compliance . 
Mid-level staffers at the [ORG NSC  ] and [ORG IAEC  ] were also disquieted by [LOC U.S.  ] press reports claiming that the [ORG USG  ] is re-examining its position on [LOC Hizballah.  ] ------------------------------------------ The [ORG Military Option: Bushehr  ] is not Osirak ------------------------------------------ <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Despite frustrations with diplomatic efforts , [MISC Israeli  ] officials are understandably reluctant to discuss possible military options . 
In public , PM [PER Sharon  ] has stressed the importance of the " political and economic " track . 
During a recent discussion with a visiting [ORG USG  ] official , IDF Deputy Chief of Staff ( and [MISC CoS-designate  ] ) Major General [PER Dani Haloutz  ] similarly said " we don't want to go there . 
" In February , President [PER Katsav  ] told the Secretary that " the military option is not necessary -- bring the issue to the [ORG Security Council  ] . 
" <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Public speculation about possible military strikes usually focuses on the differences from the [MISC Israeli  ] [ORG Air Force  ] 's attack on [LOC Iraq  ] 's Osirak reactor in 1981 . 
In private , [ORG GOI  ] officials have acknowledged that several factors would make any attack against [LOC Iran  ] a much more difficult mission . 
A senior military intelligence official told the Embassy that the [ORG GOI  ] does not know where all of the targets are located and said that any attack would only delay , not end , the [MISC Iranian  ] program . 
The [ORG MFA  ] 's office director for the [LOC Gulf  ] states noted that potential target sites are well dispersed throughout the country , with several located in built-up civilian areas . 
The [ORG IAEC  ] stressed the importance of [MISC Russian  ] assistance in restraining [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear ambitions and said that any attack on [ORG Bushehr  ] would likely result in [MISC Russian  ] casualties and endanger [LOC Moscow  ] 's cooperation. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [ORG MFA  ] contacts said that the distance to the targets and the presence of [LOC U.S.  ] forces in [LOC Iraq  ] and the [LOC Gulf  ] raise additional complications . 
An [MISC Israeli  ] assault would necessitate prior coordination with coalition forces in [LOC Iraq  ] , they maintained , leaving the [ORG USG  ] open to retaliation throughout the [MISC Islamic  ] world , especially in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[ORG MFA  ] and [ORG NSC  ] officials acknowledged that any attack would also elicit a strong response from [MISC Arab  ] states and the [MISC Palestinians  ] , effectively freezing the peace process. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) The [MISC Israelis  ] realize that [LOC Iran  ] would use any military strike as an excuse to cease cooperation with the [ORG EU-3  ] and the [ORG IAEA  ] . 
In addition , the [ORG GOI  ] is acutely aware of [LOC Iran  ] 's ability to retaliate , both militarily and through attacks by its regional surrogates . 
PM [PER Sharon  ] has claimed that [ORG Hizballah  ] has 11,000 rockets ( and possibly UAVs ) capable of reaching [LOC Israel  ] from launching sites in [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
The [ORG MFA  ] 's office director for the [LOC Gulf  ] states said that she believed that [LOC Iran  ] would retaliate by inciting terrorist groups in [LOC Israel  ] and the [ORG Occupied Territories.  ] <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) Current [ORG USG  ] , [ORG EU-3  ] , and [ORG IAEA  ] focus on [LOC Iran  ] also creates a situation that differs from 1981 , when the [MISC Israelis  ] felt that the international community was ignoring the [MISC Iraqi  ] threat . 
[MISC Israelis  ] hope that the others will solve the [MISC Iranian  ] problem for them , or as Vice PM [PER Shimon Peres  ] has said , " I do not think that the matter of [LOC Iran  ] needs to be turned into an [MISC Israeli  ] problem -- it is a matter of concern for the whole world . 
" --------------------------------------------- -- [ORG Comment: Diplomatic Solution Preferred  ] , but ... --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG COMMENT:  ] The [MISC Israelis  ] are focusing on diplomatic channels in the [ORG IAEA  ] and [ORG EU-3  ] , and appear to have very real concerns about the feasibility of military strikes against the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear program . 
Nevertheless , the [ORG GOI  ] has shown time and again that it will act militarily if it believes that its security is threatened , and the IDF is most certainly keeping contingency plans up to date . 
The [MISC Israeli  ] press reported that in February PM [PER Sharon  ] 's [ORG Security Cabinet  ] had given " initial authorization " for an attack on [LOC Iran  ] . 
The press reports cited an unnamed " [MISC Israeli  ] security source , " who claimed that the [ORG USG  ] would " authorize " an [MISC Israeli  ] attack . 
Post notes that it may not be possible to detect preparations for any military strike . 
[ORG Air  ] defense operations would pose nearly perfect cover for civil defense and [ORG Air Force  ] activities preceding any attack . 
Due to both the extreme sensitivity of the issue and the [ORG GOI  ] 's near inability to prevent leaks , any attack order would be closely held , probably even from many members of PM [PER Sharon  ] 's Cabinet. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) COMMENT CONTINUED: The [ORG GOI  ] knows that we share its interest in preventing [LOC Iran  ] from obtaining nuclear weapons . 
Nevertheless , we should expect continued [MISC Israeli  ] lobbying at the highest levels urging the [ORG USG  ] to ensure that the [ORG EU-3  ] effort is on track and backed by a solid international front . 
We will also hear [MISC Israeli  ] concerns that the [LOC U.S.  ] position may move toward the [ORG EU  ] stance . 
At the same time , we should recognize that [MISC Israeli  ] intelligence briefings will understandably focus on worst-case scenarios and may not match current [ORG USG  ] assessments. ********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy [LOC Tel Aviv  ] 's Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv You can also access this site through the [ORG State Department  ] 's Classified SIPRNET website. ********************************************* ******************** KURTZER</pre></code>
