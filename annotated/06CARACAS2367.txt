There is no reason to believe that the fundamentals of the [MISC Cuba-Venezuela  ] relationship -- with [LOC Venezuela  ] providing huge resource flows , and the [MISC Cubans  ] providing tens of thousands of " advisors " -- will change through the medium term . 
[PER Castro  ] 's absence from the scene will deprive [PER Chavez  ] of an avuncular presence and a proven crisis manager , which may increase [PER Chavez'  ] vulnerability . 
In the event of [PER Castro  ] 's permanent departure from the scene , the mercurial [PER Chavez  ] may become even more unpredictable . 
[PER Chavez  ] may believe his regime 's survival is tied to that of a [MISC Castroite  ] successor government , and under a conceivable set of circumstances might even be willing to deploy [MISC Venezuelan  ] military assets in support of a successor regime . 
Embassy believes this would be an apt moment to warn the [ORG BRV  ] against intervening in [LOC Cuba  ] during its transition . 
End summary . 
Initial BRV Reactions to [PER Castro  ] Announcement -------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Initial [LOC Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela  ] ( [ORG BRV  ] ) reaction to the news of [PER Castro  ] 's illness and temporary hand-over of power has been limited to parroting the [MISC Cuban  ] line . 
Speaking on August 1 in [LOC Vietnam  ] , [PER Chavez  ] seemed a bit taken by surprise and uninformed , but said he had talked to [MISC Cuban  ] officials who assured him that [PER Castro  ] " would return to his job in some weeks . 
" The same day , the [MISC Venezuelan  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] announced that they " had received , with satisfaction , news from [MISC Cuban  ] authorities " that [PER Castro  ] was recuperating . 
Vice President [PER Jose Vicente Rangel  ] similarly said that he spoke with his [MISC Cuban  ] counterpart [PER Carlos Lage  ] and [MISC Cuban  ] Foreign Minister [PER Felipe Perez Roque  ] , who assured him that the [MISC Cuban  ] leader was recovering normally. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Chavez  ] returned to [LOC Caracas  ] on August 3 , apparently without stopping in [LOC Havana  ] . 
SIMO reports indicate that he had wanted to do so , but the [MISC Cubans  ] waved him off , fearing that his presence would undercut their efforts to convey a sense of normality . 
[PER Chavez  ] got the point ; during his August 6 " [PER Alo Presidente  ] , " [PER Chavez  ] said he had learned out that [PER Castro  ] was up and talking , and expressed his confidence that the [MISC Cuban  ] leader would be back in action soon . 
Interestingly , [PER Chavez  ] did not suggest he 'd spoken personally to [PER Castro  ] . 
Too , he engaged in a lengthy digression about his appreciation for being able to meet and work with a hero from his youth . 
Certainly it was not his intention , but this part of [PER Chavez'  ] comments took on the tone of an elegy . 
Speculation on [MISC Raul-Chavez Relations  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Regardless of whether [PER Fidel  ] is alive or not , it would appear that [PER Raul  ] will continue to play a larger role than in the past . 
Public and other sources have included speculation about the lack of chemistry between [PER Chavez  ] and [PER Raul Castro  ] . 
While we question the reliability of such judgments , because it 's unclear to us the basis for reaching them , they are worth being aware of . 
[PER Americo Martin  ] , a former [MISC Venezuelan  ] Communist close to the Castros in the 1970s , told [ORG El Universal  ] that the younger [PER Castro  ] views [PER Chavez  ] with distrust and caution . 
Former [MISC Venezuelan  ] Ambassador and ubiquitous international relations analyst [PER Julio Cesar Pineda  ] told poloff August 8 that he has heard that [PER Chavez  ] is close to FM [PER Perez Roque  ] , and VP [PER Lage  ] , who it would appear are going [LOC CARACAS  ] 00002367 002.2 OF 004 to continue to play important roles in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
Exiled [MISC Cuban  ] intellectual [PER Carlos Alberto Montaner  ] probably made the most relevant observation in noting that [PER Raul  ] and [PER Chavez  ] lack the emotional ties that bind [PER Fidel  ] and [PER Chavez  ] . 
What Does it Mean for [LOC Venezuela  ] ? -------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) While there are a number of unknowns in the equation , there is no reason to believe much will change in the bilateral relationship in the short to medium term . 
Both countries derive benefits from the relationship . 
[LOC Cuba  ] benefits from the millions in oil and transfer payments for services rendered ; [LOC Venezuela  ] benefits from the advice of [PER Castro  ] and tens of thousands of " trainers " and doctors . 
Apparent [MISC Cuban  ] influence in [LOC Venezuela  ] has grown dramatically , to the point that opposition [MISC Venezuelans  ] sardonically refer to " [MISC Venecuba  ] " or " [MISC Cubazuela  ] " ( both forms are acceptable ) . 
[PER Chavez  ] relies heavily on [MISC Cuban  ] advisors to implement programs that are one of the keys to his political success . 
We assess there could be as many as 40,000 [MISC Cubans  ] currently in [LOC Venezuela  ] , managing , guiding , and implementing [PER Chavez'  ] social missions ( e.g. , [ORG Barrio Adentro  ] medical program , [PER Mision Robinson  ] literacy program , Mercal state-owned grocery chain , etc . 
) Rumors swirl about [MISC Cubans  ] taking central roles in sensitive government functions , including in [PER Chavez'  ] personal security , the military , the [ORG National Electoral Council  ] , the national identification Office , even land titling offices . 
None of that is going to change soon . 
The [MISC Bolivarian  ] regime is deriving political and organizational benefit from it , and the [MISC Cubans  ] are getting paid hard currency for it. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) We judge that [PER Chavez  ] will also want to continue [LOC Venezuela  ] 's generous petroleum support to [LOC Cuba  ] , which we currently estimate at 98,000 barrels per day , worth at least $7 million a day , or $2.5 billion a year . 
SIMO reporting indicates that [PER Chavez  ] directed that his staff find ways of increasing resource flows to [LOC Cuba  ] . 
We can think of two motivations [PER Chavez  ] might have in increasing cash flow to [MISC Cuba:  ] first , to help a friend in need ; the one thing he has is cash , and he can give more of it . 
Second , it may also be true that [PER Chavez  ] is looking to bump up transfer payments in order to increase his influence in [LOC Cuba  ] at this critical moment . 
The economic assistance could become a problem , however , if the egoistic , increasingly intrusive [PER Chavez  ] used it to promote his own candidate in any ensuing power struggle , prolonging the infighting and delaying a democratic transition . 
How Does [PER Chavez  ] Act if [PER Castro  ] is Debilitated or Dead ? --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Castro  ] 's prolonged convalescence or even death is likely to cause headaches for the region and roil bilateral relations . 
Some argue that [PER Castro  ] has had a moderating influence on [PER Chavez  ] , and so he'll really let go if [PER Castro  ] is gone . 
The predicate seems wrong to us . 
It 's hard to see much moderation in [PER Chavez'  ] recent behavior: open interventionism and tendency to pick fights with leaders throughout the hemisphere , his embrace of pariah states ( including especially the vote for [LOC Iran  ] at the [ORG IAEA  ] and the apparent endorsement of the [ORG DPRK  ] 's July 4 missile launches ) , and his government 's relentless assault on basic freedoms within [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
It may be closer to the mark to observe that [PER Castro  ] is one of the few people who could contradict [PER Chavez  ] or give him news he didn't want to hear . 
We 've received numerous reports that [PER Chavez  ] is left surrounded by yes-men , because he simply won't accept bad news or criticism . 
The absence of [PER Castro  ] -- to [PER Chavez  ] , respected and avuncular -- could make the mercurial [PER Chavez  ] even more [LOC CARACAS  ] 00002367 003 OF 004 unpredictable and radical. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Over time , [PER Chavez  ] will probably move toward assuming the mantle as ( in [PER Castro  ] 's words ) " my successor to advance social revolution . 
" [PER Chavez  ] will need to work this issue slowly , as he does not wish to suggest prematurely that [PER Castro  ] is dead and inadvertently cause problems for -- or with -- any successor Castroite regime . 
That said , [PER Chavez  ] has neither the intellectual candlepower nor the international environment to replicate [PER Castro  ] 's rise to international prominence . 
That doesn't mean he won't try , and he'll play his best card -- oil wealth -- whenever he needs to . 
And whatever the force of his arguments , his checkbook is going to speak loudly. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) We should be particularly mindful that [PER Chavez  ] will be a committed advocate of the continuation of a repressive regime in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
[PER Chavez  ] has been on a losing streak , with the electoral results in [LOC Peru  ] and ( it seems ) in [LOC Mexico  ] ; were [LOC Cuba  ] now to turn toward democracy , [PER Chavez  ] would be increasingly isolated as the sole radical leftist in the hemisphere . 
[PER Chavez  ] may believe that the survival of his regime is tied to that of the [PER Castro  ] regime. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) There are some even more troubling scenarios that one can play out in this regard . 
[PER Chavez  ] has said as recently as this April that he 'd be willing to spill [MISC Venezuelan  ] blood to save the [MISC Cuban  ] regime ( although he was speaking about a [LOC U.S.  ] invasion ) . 
Were there to be an internal civil conflict in [LOC Cuba  ] , we believe it possible that [PER Chavez  ] would consider intervening militarily on the side of pro-regime elements . 
It is not clear to us that such an intervention would be militarily effective , but the presence , or even threat , of a [MISC Venezuelan  ] force in [LOC Cuba  ] would have important implications for [LOC Cuba  ] and for us . 
Perhaps the most likely scenario would have the [MISC Venezuelans  ] providing lift capability to loyalist troops ; the [MISC Venezuelan  ] [ORG Armed Force  ] ( [ORG FAV  ] ) does retain some fixed-wing and rotary lift capability . 
That said , a [MISC Venezuelan  ] navy troopship regularly plies between [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] , and could conceivably be used to move [ORG FAV  ] troops to the island . 
( 11 . 
( C ) Comment: As noted in previous email traffic , Embassy suggests that this may be an apt time to warn the [ORG BRV  ] against intervening in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
) An Achilles' Heel ? ------------------ <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) These are some fairly gloomy scenarios . 
We can conceive how [PER Castro  ] 's absence might actually make [PER Chavez  ] more vulnerable . 
[PER Hugo Chavez  ] is a master tactician , regularly assessing the domestic political situation better and faster than the opposition , and making moves to box in his democratic opponents . 
What [PER Chavez  ] is less good at is crisis management . 
To take a recent example , [PER Chavez'  ] first instinct to go to [PER Castro  ] 's sickbed was wrong , because it would have undercut the regime 's " all is well " line . 
There are historical examples , of [PER Chavez  ] cracking under pressure . 
In both the 1992 and the 2002 failed coups , evidence suggests that [PER Chavez  ] lost his nerve at key moments . 
His military colleagues were willing to fight on in 1992 when he was holed up in the [ORG Military Museum  ] , but he surrendered them all . 
In 2002 , a weepy [PER Chavez  ] was reportedly ready to sign the letter of resignation and flee to [LOC Cuba  ] . 
[PER Castro  ] has proved his worth to [PER Chavez  ] as a proxy crisis manager . 
It was [PER Castro  ] who told [PER Chavez  ] to fight on in 2002 , and it was [PER Castro  ] who worked the phones to reassemble a pro-Chavez consensus in the armed forces . 
In 2004 , as the recall referendum approached , it was [PER Castro  ] who conceived and executed the " misiones " plan to buck [LOC CARACAS  ] 00002367 004.2 OF 004 up [PER Chavez'  ] popularity . 
In [LOC Cuba  ] , from the [MISC Cuban  ] [ORG Missile Crisis  ] to [ORG Mariel  ] to the [PER Maleconazo  ] to the [LOC Special Period  ] , [PER Fidel Castro  ] has proven himself to be a superb crisis manager . 
Should [PER Chavez  ] confront a thorny crisis , especially a domestic crisis , he may suffer significantly from the loss of [PER Castro  ] 's steady hand at his back . 
This , in turn , could be an advantage for us in our efforts to urge a return to full democracy in [LOC Venezuela.</pre></code>  ]
