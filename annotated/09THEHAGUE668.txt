THE HAGUE 615 Classified By: PolEcon Counselor [PER Andrew C. Mann  ] for reasons 1.5 ( b , d ) ( C ) Post conveyed reftel A points to key MFA staff covering the [LOC Middle East  ] , the [ORG UN  ] , and human rights . 
[PER Lex Gerts  ] , Deputy Head of the [ORG Human Rights Division  ] , said the [MISC Dutch  ] would apply the same redlines they used in [LOC Geneva  ] to determine their vote on [ORG UNGA  ] resolutions concerning the [LOC Goldstone  ] report -- supporting the primary role of the [ORG Human Rights Council  ] in evaluating the report , letting the parties conduct their own internal investigations , and permitting time for those investigations to take place . 
A deadline for further action or review would be appropriate in 5-6 months , as contemplated in the previous compromise to defer consideration of the report until March 2010 . 
A deadline of 3 months would be too early . 
[PER Gerts  ] emphasized that the [MISC Dutch  ] parliament fully supports this approach . 
( Note: The parliament 's support follows a compromise reached within the governing coalition , reftel B , allowing the [MISC Dutch  ] to oppose the [LOC Goldstone  ] resolution at the [ORG Human Rights Council  ] . 
End Note .
