End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) In a December 7 dinner meeting with [ORG Ambassador-at-Large  ] [PER Henry Crumpton  ] , [ORG Russian Special Presidential  ] Representative [PER Anatoliy Safonov  ] welcomed several proposals aimed at extending bilateral counterterrorism ( [LOC CT  ] ) cooperation . 
[PER Safonov  ] opened the meeting by expressing his appreciation for [MISC U.S./Russian  ] cooperative efforts thus far . 
He cited the recent events in [LOC London  ] - specifically the murder of a former [MISC Russian  ] spy by exposure to radioactive agents - as evidence of how great the threat remained and how much more there was to do on the cooperative front . 
( [MISC Comment:  ] The implication was that the FOR was not involved , although [PER Safonov  ] did not offer any further explanation . 
) [PER Safonov  ] noted the daunting number of countries that posed particular terrorism threats , mentioning [LOC North Korea  ] , [LOC Pakistan  ] , [LOC South Africa  ] , [LOC Libya  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC India  ] , and [LOC Israel  ] ( sic ? ) . 
He described a range of dangers , stressing the more immediate threats posed by nuclear and biological terrorism , but also acknowledging the risks of chemical terrorism . 
[PER Safonov  ] highlighted coverage of transit corridors as one of the most promising areas of [MISC U.S./Russian  ] [LOC CT  ] cooperation and commented that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia  ] should continue to refine this effort. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) [PER Safonov  ] was particularly enthusiastic about [PER Crumpton  ] , s proposal that their respective governments cooperatively engage the private sector in their [LOC CT  ] efforts . 
[PER Crumpton  ] made specific reference to the Business Executives for [ORG National Security  ] as one [MISC American  ] group they might contact . 
[PER Safonov  ] applauded the idea , s potential for offering new [LOC CT  ] perspectives and expressed the hope that such cooperation might enrich [MISC Russian  ] private-sector business , which he said could learn a lot from its [MISC American  ] counterpart . 
[PER Crumpton  ] also suggested the [ORG Russia/United States Business Council  ] as a possible starting point for engaging the private sector . 
[PER Safonov  ] said he would meet with Ambassador [PER Burns  ] in [LOC Moscow  ] to discuss next steps , and both men agreed to explore possible private sector contacts in their home countries. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) [PER Safonov  ] reiterated his belief that new perspectives and out-of-the-box thinking were critical to defeating terrorism and expressed his appreciation for scientific approaches , which he asserted were “broader and less conditioned by lived experience” . 
He cited one physicist , s conception of global terrorism as analogous to biological disease , i.e. , the fever that serves as a warning for larger problems . 
[PER Crumpton  ] agreed with [PER Safonov  ] about the importance of scientific perspectives and suggested that they expand their cooperation with [ORG Sandia National Laboratories  ] in [LOC New Mexico  ] , specifically that they jointly direct the scientists there to undertake terrorist scenario modeling . 
[PER Crumpton  ] noted that the [ORG Sandia Laboratories  ] already had established relationships with [MISC Russian  ] counterparts and had worked cooperatively with them on nuclear safety and biological weapons threats , which could also be a topics for ongoing cooperation . 
[PER Safonov  ] agreed , and asked for the names of the affiliated [MISC Russian  ] research groups . 
In this context , the two also touched on the importance of continued bioterrorism cooperation including bilateral consultations ; [PER Safonov  ] seemed keen to expand all avenues of joint action. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) Also on the topic of taking advantage of academic perspectives , Ambassador [PER Crumpton  ] offered to “loan” XXXXXXXXXXXX to engage with [PER Safonov  ] , s team in [LOC Russia  ] and to review the situation in [LOC Chechnya  ] . 
[PER Safonov  ] seemed amenable , but the two did not discuss specifics. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) On [LOC Iraq  ] , [PER Crumpton  ] stressed the paramount importance of preventing [ORG Al Qaida  ] from establishing a safe operating haven in [LOC Iraq  ] , which could serve as a staging area for the whole region . 
He also conveyed the [ORG USG  ] , s intention to provide [LOC Russia  ] with all available information on the terrorists responsible for the recent kidnapping and killing of [MISC Russian  ] diplomats , noting that the [ORG CIA  ] had already met all but one of the [MISC Russian  ] information requests that had been made since June of 2006 . 
On [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Crumpton  ] relayed the [ORG USG  ] , s intention to provide the [MISC Russian  ] government with a formal intelligence report detailing the [MISC Iranian  ] terrorist threat , including specific links to [ORG Hamas  ] and other groups , [LOC Iran  ] , s ongoing support of [MISC Iraqi  ] [ORG Shia  ] , and information on [MISC Iranian  ] missile transfers to [ORG Hizballah.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) [PER Crumpton  ] asserted there was a pressing need for the [MISC G-8  ] to establish uniform criteria for designating terrorists and terrorist groups . 
[PER Safonov  ] agreed and noted that “We need to overcome this deadlock...Right now there are about twelve groups causing disagreement.” [PER Crumpton  ] concurred and pressed for the name of the [MISC Russian  ] official [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] who was authorized to continue to negotiate on establishing uniform criteria . 
In the only slightly evasive exchange during the entire three-hour conversation , [PER Safonov  ] resisted answering outright ; after repeated questioning , he provided the name of XXXXXXXXXXXX and the qualification that “there are two layers ( to this issue ) ”. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) [PER Crumpton  ] invited [LOC Russia  ] to participate in a four-day experts , conference sponsored by the [ORG Marshall Center  ] to discuss how terrorists exploit [MISC Islam  ] and the ideological threat of “Jihadism” . 
[PER Safonov  ] accepted the invitation immediately and expressed great interest in exploring how they might reverse the extremists , “hijacking” of [MISC Islam  ] . 
[PER Crumpton  ] told [PER Safonov  ] that the conference -- to include [ORG NATO  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , and [LOC Turkey  ] -- was planned for May in [LOC Istanbul  ] and was tentatively divided into two days spent with subject matter experts and two days spent with policy makers. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) [PER Safonov  ] enthusiastically agreed to and elaborated on [PER Crumpton  ] , s ideas for publicly highlighting [LOC U.S./Russia CT  ] cooperation . 
[PER Safonov  ] accepted [PER Crumpton  ] , s invitation to visit the [LOC United States  ] as his guest and went on to suggest that they could publicize the visit with cross-directed press events wherein each of them would be interviewed by journalists from the other country . 
[PER Crumpton  ] pressed for a short time line , inviting [PER Safonov  ] to come to [LOC New York  ] in January 2007 , then going on to [LOC Los Angeles  ] together ; [PER Safonov  ] suggested a March-April 2007 visit timeframe . 
[PER Safonov  ] accepted responsibility for arranging the next steps. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) In the course of their exchange , [PER Safonov  ] made the following passing statements: --Safonov claimed that [MISC Russian  ] authorities in [LOC London  ] had known about and followed individuals moving radioactive substances into the city but were told by the [MISC British  ] that they were under control before the poisoning took place. --On [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Safonov  ] said that [MISC British  ] and [MISC Canadian  ] soldiers were well regarded , but [MISC Dutch  ] soldiers were causing problems by posing “constant questions about governance”. --On [LOC Lebanon  ] , [PER Safonov  ] judged that the situation was probably “not yet at the bottom” and so there may not yet be enough incentive to find a solution . 
The key was to prevent any movement toward civil war . 
To that end , the [MISC Russian  ] government planned to continue to work with [LOC Syria  ] , which “is not the central cause of the conflict and in some ways is also a hostage of the situation” . 
In [PER Safonov  ] , s eyes , the conflict had no single cause , but rather was composed of many problems and many actors , though the present crisis likely would not have arisen if former [MISC Israeli  ] PM [PER Sharon  ] had been in charge . 
He believed [PER Sharon  ] would not have made the error of attacking a nation when the enemy was [ORG Hizballah.  ] --In [LOC Iraq  ] , coalition forces’ failure to restore order reminded [PER Safonov  ] of an exchange he had with a freedom fighter just after [MISC Russian  ] forces had captured [LOC Grozny  ] . 
The fighter told him , “Your real problems are only now beginning.” <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 .
