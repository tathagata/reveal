Rubin  ] for Reasons 1.4 ( b/d ) ------- SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] is seeking information about the companies’ relations with shadowy and reportedly [MISC Kremlin-connected  ] oil trader [PER Gunvor  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] he just wants to shed light on the fundamental need for transparency in [LOC Russia  ] , where no one seems to care about “massive corruption.” [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] End summary ------------------------- “TOTALLY NON-TRANSPARENT” ------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) A primary and very large hurdle for those who analyze [MISC Russia’s  ] oil and gas sector is the dearth of reliable information . 
News reports abound of large business transactions related to little-known companies and involving undisclosed sums . 
This lack of transparency is often discussed , but is seldom officially challenged . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
Both [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that the rising and reportedly massive volumes of trade through secretive [MISC Swiss-based  ] oil trading firm [PER Gunvor  ] were the genesis of the cases against [ORG Rosneft  ] , [ORG Gazpromneft  ] , and [ORG Surgutneftegaz  ] . 
This trade was resulting in reportedly very large profits for [PER Gunvor  ] and its secretive ownership , which is rumored to include Prime Minister [PER Putin.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he believes that [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and he is frustrated that nobody in [LOC Russia  ] seems to care . 
According to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [PER Gunvor  ] has risen quickly to become the top trader of [MISC Russian  ] oil exports , now responsible for up to 50% of the total . 
He is seeking information from the companies about their relationships with [MISC Gunvor:  ] trading volumes , the general terms of the contracts , and how this particular trading company was selected by the oil companies . 
The companies , have stonewalled -- their relations with [PER Gunvor  ] are &totally non-transparent , ” [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] complained. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] Transneft , the primarily government-owned oil transportation monopoly . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] information related to 13 billion rubles ( $530 million ) that the company reportedly donated to “charity” in the last two years . 
According to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] , the company gave more to charity than it spent on pipeline repair and maintenance or paid out in dividends . 
However , the company has refused to disclose any information related to its charitable contributions , including the names of the beneficiaries. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] --------------------------------------------- WHO OWNS RUSSIA’S FOURTH LARGEST OIL COMPANY ? --------------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Of the companies [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] one stands out for its secrecy -- [ORG Surgutneftegaz  ] . 
As with [PER Gunvor  ] , the company is rumored to be one of [MISC Putin’s  ] sources of undisclosed wealth . 
No one knows who the ultimate beneficiaries are of the company , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] “Can you believe , ” he told us , “that no one knows who owns [MISC Russia’s  ] fourth largest oil company ? ” [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that he personally does not believe [PER Putin  ] owns either [ORG Surgutneftegaz  ] or [PER Gunvor  ] since the Prime Minister does not really need to have a direct link to an asset to benefit from it. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] added that all requests for information from [ORG Surgutneftegaz  ] are routinely denied . 
After numerous requests and many instances of “not our department” responses , sometimes someone in the company provides some vague information that is “totally unverifiable.” [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that unfortunately little can be done but to sue , and those suits are clearly going nowhere. --------------------------------------------- - NO ILLUSIONS OF WINNING , BUT SUITS TO CONTINUE --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) XXXXXXXXXXX------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Opacity is commonplace in [MISC Russian  ] business , especially in the sensitive oil sector , and it is a major hindrance to modernization . 
Without a steady flow of verifiable information , efficient capitalism is impossible . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] End comment .
