( C/NF ) Summary: [LOC U.S.  ] representative to the [ORG International Whaling Commission  ] ( [ORG IWC  ] ) [PER Monica Medina  ] met with senior officials from the [ORG Fisheries Agency of Japan  ] ( [ORG FAJ  ] ) November 4 to discuss progress in negotiations under the Future of the [ORG IWC  ] process . 
The [ORG FAJ  ] Director General described the results of recent talks in [LOC Santiago  ] as a " major step forward " and said political level consultations on whaling are necessary following the recent change in administration in [LOC Japan  ] . 
He defended [LOC Japan  ] 's proposal to base future reductions in numbers on current catch quotas rather than the actual number of whales taken in past years . 
He added that [LOC Australia  ] 's proposal to phase out research whaling is a non-starter for [LOC Japan  ] . 
He said a successful outcome in the vote on [LOC Greenland  ] 's proposal to take humpback whales and action by the [LOC U.S.  ] and others on [LOC Japan  ] 's complaints against the [ORG Sea Shepherd Conservation Society  ] would positively influence [LOC Japan  ] 's negotiating position in the Future of the [ORG IWC  ] process . 
[PER Ms. Medina  ] said the [ORG USG  ] is looking for creative solutions to the remaining issues facing the [ORG IWC  ] and positive mention at the upcoming [MISC U.S.-Japan  ] summit of both sides' commitment to finding a solution on whaling would be a good signal . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Commerce for [LOC Oceans  ] and Atmosphere and [LOC U.S.  ] representative to the [ORG International Whaling Commission  ] [PER Monica Medina  ] met with senior [ORG Fisheries Agency of Japan  ] officials to discuss the Future of the [ORG IWC  ] process November 4 in [LOC Tokyo  ] . 
In a morning meeting with [PER Ms. Medina  ] , [ORG Fisheries Agency of Japan  ] Director General [PER Machida  ] said that while he expects difficult negotiations ahead , he wants the Future of the [ORG IWC  ] process to succeed . 
According to [PER Machida  ] , political level consultations on whaling are necessary following the recent change in administration in [LOC Japan  ] . 
However , he cautioned the new [ORG Democratic Party of Japan  ] ( [ORG DPJ  ] ) administration shares the same fundamental position on whaling as the outgoing [ORG Liberal Democratic Party  ] , including support for the resumption of commercial whaling and continued research whaling . 
He added that the two sides should not rush through the negotiations , which could end up making it more difficult to reach consensus at next June 's [ORG IWC  ] annual meeting. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Ms. Medina  ] said the [ORG USG  ] understands there is no fundamental change in the [ORG GOJ  ] position on whaling , but that the [ORG USG  ] is looking for creative solutions to move the [ORG IWC  ] forward as opposed to fundamental change . 
She added that the [LOC U.S.  ] is committed to finding a solution over the next two to three months . 
She said she would advocate for including language on whaling in a summit statement following the meeting between the President and Prime Minister November 13 . 
The statement would express the desire of both countries to work out remaining differences on whaling . 
Once negotiators have narrowed the issues , both sides could seek a political solution , she added. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Machida  ] described the progress at the [ORG Support Group  ] meeting in [LOC Santiago  ] as a major step forward . 
However , he said there remain two major issues that need to be addressed . 
First , there is still no consensus on the proposals raised in [LOC Santiago  ] even among the [ORG Support Group  ] members , let alone the entire [ORG IWC  ] . 
Second , the upper limit on catch quotas , especially a reduction in the limit for [LOC Japan  ] 's research whaling in the [LOC Southern Ocean  ] , have yet to be negotiated . 
Regarding [LOC Japan  ] 's catch numbers , [PER Machida  ] said [LOC Australia  ] 's proposal to phase out research whaling is a non-starter for the [ORG GOJ  ] . 
He added that the baseline for any reduction in [LOC Japan  ] 's research whaling should be the catch quota figures and not the actual number of whales caught . 
[LOC TOKYO  ] 00002588 002 OF 002 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Ms. Medina  ] replied that the catch quotas is the most important outstanding issue . 
She said the [LOC Santiago  ] proposal calls for an overall reduction in catch numbers from all whaling nations over a ten year period , which would help in securing approval from [LOC Australia  ] , [LOC New Zealand  ] , and the [LOC UK  ] . 
She said given the history of [LOC Japan  ] 's research whaling , and the increase in quota numbers in recent years , there is room for [LOC Japan  ] to cut from the actual number of whales taken . 
A symbolic action by [LOC Japan  ] , such as agreeing not to take fin whales this year , would be a good indicator to the rest of the [ORG IWC  ] of [LOC Japan  ] 's commitment to reaching a solution . 
The [ORG USG  ] would then work hard to make sure the [ORG EU  ] and [LOC Australia  ] do not block a compromise. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Machida  ] said there are two factors outside the current Future of the [ORG IWC  ] negotiations that influence [LOC Japan  ] 's negotiating position . 
First , a negative outcome in the vote at next year 's [ORG IWC  ] intersessional meeting on [LOC Greenland  ] 's proposal to catch ten humpback whales could derail the work of the [ORG Support Group  ] . 
[LOC Greenland  ] 's proposal has the backing of the [ORG IWC  ] 's [ORG Scientific Committee  ] and another rejection at the [ORG IWC  ] plenary meeting could make the overall compromise being discussed impossible . 
Second , the violent protests by the [ORG Sea Shepherd Conservation Society  ] ( [ORG SSCS  ] ) could limit the [ORG GOJ  ] 's flexibility in the negotiations . 
He said the [LOC Netherlands  ] should have primary responsibly for taking action against the [ORG SSCS  ] , but he appreciates the [ORG USG  ] initiative to address the group 's tax exempt status . 
He said action on the [ORG SSCS  ] would be a major element for [LOC Japan  ] in the success of the overall negotiations . 
[PER Ms. Medina  ] replied that she hopes to work out differences with the [ORG EU  ] on [LOC Greenland  ] 's proposal on humpback whales prior to the March 2010 [ORG IWC  ] intersessional meeting and include the issue in the overall agreement . 
Regarding the [ORG SSCS  ] , she said she believes the [ORG USG  ] can demonstrate the group does not deserve tax exempt status based on their aggressive and harmful actions. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) Ms. [PER Medina  ] cleared this cable subsequent to departing [LOC Tokyo  ] .
