Jeffrey  ] , Reasons 1.4 ( a , b , d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) PM [PER Erdogan  ] welcomed President [PER Obama  ] 's reiteration of support to the fight against the [ORG PKK  ] during the December 7 meeting in the [ORG Oval Office  ] , but the Secretary should expect questions about how we will operationalize that commitment as plans to withdraw from [LOC Iraq  ] move forward . 
A key issue will be how to reduce the gap between the time when the [LOC U.S.  ] is no longer able to provide [ORG ISR  ] support and when we will be able to help [LOC Turkey  ] acquire its own capability . 
On missile defense , we will look for the Secretary 's help in advancing our work with [LOC Turkey  ] to persuade the [LOC Turks  ] to allow a key radar system to be based here . 
The [LOC Turks  ] are struggling to define what they will need in terms of [ORG NATO  ] political cover to lessen the high cost - both in terms of domestic politics and in relations with [LOC Iran  ] - that [PER Erdogan  ] 's government believes it will have to pay should they agree. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) Although our agenda with [LOC Turkey  ] is broad and complex , the following issues are likely to come up during the Secretary 's trip: " Need To Raise " ---------------- - Our commitment to continue sharing real-time intelligence to support [LOC Turkey  ] 's counter-PKK fight , but caution that the process for [LOC Turkey  ] to acquire an armed UAV system from the [LOC U.S.  ] will be long and complex . 
( para 3-5 , 14 ) - The need for a [ORG NATO  ] BMD system with [LOC Turkey  ] 's participation and the [MISC Iranian  ] threat against [ORG NATO  ] interests . 
( para 6-9 ) - Appreciation for [LOC Turkey  ] 's efforts on Afghanistan/Pakistan , particularly for its new commitments to training security forces . 
( para 10-11 ) - Appreciation for support to [LOC OIF/OEF  ] through [LOC Turkey  ] 's territory , including the [ORG Incirlik Cargo Hub  ] ; easing transit of non-lethal mil cargo shipments from [LOC Iraq  ] to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
( para 12 ) - Our advocacy support for [ORG Raytheon  ] and [ORG Sikorsky  ] on sales of air defense systems and utility helicopters ( para 13 ) . 
" Be Ready To [MISC Respond  ] On " ------------------------ - Pressure for direct [LOC U.S.  ] milops against the [ORG PKK  ] ( paras 5 ) - [MISC Turkish  ] requests for 24/7 Predator coverage of the [MISC Turkey-Iraq  ] border to counter [ORG PKK  ] operations and activities ( para 5 ) . - [MISC Turkish  ] requests for immediate delivery of [MISC AH-1W  ] helicopters ( para 15 ) Counter - [ORG PKK  ] Operations: Still [LOC Turkey  ] 's Top Priority --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [LOC Turkey  ] 's counter-terrorist efforts against the [ORG PKK  ] have evolved in the past year and have expanded beyond military action alone . 
Although the government 's renamed [ORG National Unity Project  ] ( initially called the " [MISC Kurdish Opening  ] " ) was not fully developed when launched and appears to be moving slowly , the government has increased social and economic support to ethnic [MISC Kurds  ] in southeast [LOC Turkey  ] , dramatically broadened the rights of [MISC Kurds  ] to use their own language , and increased educational opportunities as well . 
It is post 's view that the military success against the [ORG PKK  ] , supported by our intelligence-sharing operation , has given the civilians the political space to explore this opening and to deal directly with [PER Masoud Barzani  ] and other [MISC Iraqi Kurds  ] . 
[MISC Turkish  ] military operations against the [ORG PKK  ] continue , however , and on October 6 , 2009 Parliament extended the government 's mandate to conduct cross-border operations against the [ORG PKK  ] in [LOC Iraq  ] for another year . 
[LOC Turkey  ] 's leaders have learned from us and from their own experience that only a whole-of-government approach will succeed against the [ORG PKK  ] insurgency. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Our November 2007 decision to share operational intelligence was a turning point for the bilateral relationship , and President [PER Obama  ] 's declaration before the [MISC Turkish  ] Parliament in April 2009 and during his oval office meeting with [PER Erdogan  ] in December 2009 of our continuing commitment to support [LOC Turkey  ] 's fight against the [ORG PKK  ] were warmly welcomed . 
Our cooperation has helped to improve the bilateral relationship across the board , particularly by making it difficult for [ORG PKK  ] terrorists to use northern [LOC Iraq  ] as a safe haven . 
We can never reiterate enough our continuing committment , as President [PER Obama  ] did effectively with PM [PER Erdogan  ] in December. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Nevertheless , [MISC Turkish  ] causalities are still occurring . 
[LOC Turkey  ] still looks for more support , and will press us for more concrete action before the [LOC U.S.  ] completes its withdrawal from [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[PER CHOD Basbug  ] will likely repeat the [ORG GOT  ] 's request for laser-designation of targets and/or direct [LOC U.S.  ] operations against the [ORG PKK  ] . 
In December , PM [PER Erdogan  ] also asked POTUS for 24-hour Predator coverage . 
At present we provide approximately 12-hour coverage , with an occasional surge to 24 hours to support specific [MISC Turkish  ] operations , such as against [ORG High Value Targets  ] . 
A move to 24-hour coverage is not easy due to resources requirements elsewhere ; however , we may be able to provide a few weeks of 24-hour coverage during crucial spring months , and are working with TGS to determine exactly where and when it would be most useful to do so , and what assets the [MISC Turkish  ] military would employ if additional UAV support is made available . 
Missile Defense ---------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) The [LOC Turks  ] asked us to postpone a return visit from [PER Ellen Tauscher  ] , Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and [LOC International Security  ] , as they are still considering how best to respond to our request to base an AN/TPY-2 and ( potentially ) other MD assets in [LOC Turkey  ] . 
While some of the [LOC Turks'  ] technical questions remain unanswered , the key questions are now political . 
During his meeting with President [PER Obama  ] , PM [PER Erdogan  ] said that such a system must be implemented in a [ORG NATO  ] context to diminish the political cost that his government will likely bear , both in terms of domestic politics and in [LOC Turkey  ] 's relations with [LOC Iran  ] . 
The ball is now in the court of the civilian leaders here to determine just " how much [ORG NATO  ] " will be enough for them politically ; NATOs inability to fund an " interim capability " makes it harder for us to show parallel development of a [ORG NATO  ] BMD system with [ORG PAA  ] . 
[PER Erdogan  ] is concerned that [LOC Turkey  ] 's participation might later give [LOC Israel  ] protection from an [MISC Iranian  ] counter-strike. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) We have made the point to the [LOC Turks  ] that a decision to not base the AN/TPY-2 radar in [LOC Turkey  ] is essentially a decision to opt out of missile defense coverage for [LOC Turkey  ] ; this would not be a political consequence , but just a fact based on physics and geometry . 
It is important to make this point again ( gently ) with PM [PER Erdogan  ] , but also underscore that we value [LOC Turkey  ] 's participation and will try to " NATOize " the system , if [LOC Turkey  ] will tell us how much [ORG NATO  ] would be enough. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) Behind all this , we fear , is a manifestation of both the [MISC Turkish  ] government 's , and to some degree the [MISC Turkish  ] public 's , growing distancing from the Atlanticist world view now that most dangers for [LOC Turkey  ] are gone . 
While [LOC Turks  ] are not naive about [LOC Iran  ] ( see below ) , MD places them in a pickle , forcing them to choose between the [MISC U.S./West  ] and a [LOC Middle East  ] " vocation " - which , while not necessarily includes coddling [LOC Iran  ] , requires palpable space between [LOC Turkey  ] and " the [MISC West  ] . 
" [LOC Iran  ] ---- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) [LOC Turkey  ] understands and partially shares [LOC U.S.  ] and international concerns about [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear ambitions , but is hesitant to use harsh language in public statements , in part due to its dependence on [LOC Iran  ] as an energy supplier and as a trade route to [LOC Central Asian  ] markets . 
It has worked quietly with us to prevent some proliferation-sensitive shipments to and from [LOC Iran  ] . 
[LOC Turkey  ] 's top civilian and military officials may have come to the conclusion that a military strike against [LOC Iran  ] would be more harmful for [LOC Turkey  ] 's interests than [LOC Iran  ] gaining a nuclear weapons capability ; they believe international pressure against [LOC Iran  ] only helps to strengthen [PER Ahmadinejad  ] and the hard-liners . 
PM [PER Erdogan  ] himself is a particularly vocal skeptic of the [LOC U.S.  ] position . 
However , [LOC Turkey  ] did press [LOC Iran  ] ( albeit quietly ) to accept the [MISC P5  ] plus 1 [ORG Tehran Research Reactor  ] ( [ORG TRR  ] ) offer and [PER FM Davutoglu  ] had been personally engaged in trying to rescue the [ORG TRR  ] deal , which would have removed a significant portion of [LOC Iran  ] 's lowly-enriched uranium stockpile . 
As a current member of the [ORG UNSC  ] , the [LOC Turks  ] would be very hesitant to support sanctions against [LOC Iran  ] . 
We need nevertheless to encourage PM [PER Erdogan  ] to support [ORG UN  ] actions if [LOC Iran  ] does not comply with [LOC Iran  ] 's international obligations while underscoring that we view [LOC Iran  ] 's program as a serious threat to [ORG NATO  ] interests in [LOC Europe  ] and would like to see a non-military solution ( including [MISC Turkish  ] participation in [ORG NATO  ] BMD ) . 
Afghanistan/Pakistan ---------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [LOC SBU  ] ) [LOC Turkey  ] has been a dedicated partner in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
It has commanded [ORG ISAF  ] twice since its inception and again took command of [LOC RC-Capital  ] in November . 
[LOC Turkey  ] leads [ORG PRT Wardak  ] and plans to open a second [ORG PRT  ] in Jawzjan ( also covering [LOC Sar-e-Pol  ] ) in mid-2010 . 
[LOC Turkey  ] has sponsored the " [MISC Ankara Process  ] " dialogue , one of several efforts to encourage constructive communications between [LOC Kabul  ] and [LOC Islamabad  ] , and is a leading participant in the Friends of [LOC Democratic Pakistan  ] . 
It hosted a trilateral summit on January 25 and a [LOC Afghanistan  ] Regional Summit ( including all of [LOC Afghanistan  ] 's immediate neighbors as well as select other countries including the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) on January 26 , just prior to the January 28 [ORG London Conference  ] on [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [LOC Turkey  ] pledged significant aid to both countries: [MISC USD  ] 200 million to [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [MISC USD  ] 100 million to [LOC Pakistan  ] , as well as [MISC USD  ] 1.5 million to the [ORG ANA  ] . 
There are 1750 [MISC Turkish  ] troops in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and [LOC Turkey  ] has four [MISC OMLTs  ] currently in [LOC Kabul  ] and , since December , pledged two more [MISC OMLTs  ] and one POMLT . 
Because of its culture , history and religious orientation , as well as Foreign Minister [PER Davutoglu  ] 's strategic ambition , [LOC Turkey  ] is well disposed to act as an agent of the international community 's goals in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
In 2010 , [LOC Turkey  ] has pledged to offer 6-8 week trainings for up to a brigade 's worth of [MISC Afghan  ] military and police personnel in [LOC Turkey  ] and will establish a training center in [LOC Kabul  ] capable of training up to 600 [ORG ANSA  ] personnel at a time . 
Retrograde through [LOC Turkey  ] ------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( S ) [LOC Turkey  ] 's agreement to allow us to use its territory , facilities and airspace has been essential to our ability to support operations in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
We now look to expand current capabilities to transit materiel from [LOC Iraq  ] to join up with the [ORG Northern Distribution Network  ] ( [ORG NDN  ] ) to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
CENTCOM logisticians , working with us and our [ORG EUCOM Office of Defense Cooperation  ] , seek to take advantage of improved commercial ties between [LOC Turkey  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] to move non-lethal equipment across [LOC Turkey  ] to join the [ORG NDN  ] . 
We are working to expand our current retrograde agreements to minimize the time and bureaucracy involved , and to expand permissions to allow non-lethal military equipment , including armored transport vehicles . 
Advocacy for [ORG U.S. Defense Industry  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) We much appreciate [ORG SecDef  ] 's help in advocating for [LOC U.S.  ] firms competing for key projects in [LOC Turkey  ] , and hope he can raise both [ORG Sikorsky  ] 's and [ORG Raytheon  ] 's cases in person . 
[ORG Sikorsky  ] 's " International Blackhawk " proposal holds remarkable benefits . 
This deal represents a new level of industrial partnership ; [ORG Sikorsky  ] guarantees that it would build in [LOC Turkey  ] - for sale outside of [LOC Turkey  ] - one Blackhawk for each one the [ORG GOT  ] builds and buys for itself ; this is a boon of hundreds of millions of dollars for the [MISC Turkish  ] economy . 
On [LOC Air Defense  ] , [ORG Raytheon  ] 's [LOC PAC-3  ] is competing in a tender for [LOC Turkey  ] 's air defense . 
[ORG Raytheon  ] also seeks to take advantage of [MISC Turkish  ] industry 's ability to co-produce complex systems with us and would produce systems for sale in the [LOC UAE  ] and elsewhere . 
The benefit to [LOC Turkey  ] 's economy from such co-production would likely exceed [MISC USD  ] 1 billion . 
Technically and operationally , there is no system which can compete with the [LOC PAC-3  ] , but [LOC Turkey  ] 's [ORG Defense Ministry  ] seeks to broaden competition to include lower-cost options from [LOC Russia  ] and even from [MISC European  ] producers . 
[ORG Raytheon  ] often asks us to remind the [LOC Turks  ] that a decision on requests for support on [LOC Missile Defense  ] should not necessarily affect a decision on [LOC PAC-3  ] . 
[ORG UAV  ] 's , [ORG Attack Helicopters  ] , and [ORG Intel Surge  ] ------------------------------------------ <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [LOC Turkey  ] seeks to acquire , on an urgent basis , its own ISR capability to replace the [LOC US  ] assets currently being used in anti-PKK operations . 
President [PER Obama  ] told PM [PER Erdogan  ] in December that we support [LOC Turkey  ] 's request to acquire armed [MISC Reaper UAVs  ] . 
Nevertheless , approval for armed Reapers is complicated due to Hill concerns . 
We have explained this to the [LOC Turks  ] . 
However , even if those could be overcome , the delivery pipeline for these systems is long , and [LOC Turkey  ] 's leaders have sought reassurance that we will not pull our intelligence support until they can replace it . 
While we are working to enhance [LOC Turkey  ] 's ISR capabilities , we have not made this commitment to date. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Bad [ORG GOT  ] procurement decisions led [LOC Turkey  ] to a severe shortage of dual engine , high altitude attack helicopters , which it desperately needs to fight the [ORG PKK  ] . 
PM [PER Erdogan  ] raised this issue with the President in December 2009 ; [ORG SecDef  ] should expect this issue to be a top priority in meetings with Minister [PER Gonul  ] and with [PER GEN Basbug  ] . 
The [LOC Turks  ] took [ORG SecDef  ] 's May 2009 letter to provide up to four [MISC AH-1W  ] helicopters each in 2011 , 2012 and 2013 as a firm commitment , and now have asked us to advance that date to 2010 . 
They do not accept our explanation that these aircraft are simply not available from our inventory , as they believe they have -- just like the [LOC U.S  ] . 
-- " troops in contact " and need the close tactical support . 
While [ORG SecDef  ] should make no commitment , we should also explore whether we can persuade [LOC Taiwan  ] to sell or lease some of its own [MISC AH-1W  ] aircraft now that [LOC Taiwan  ] is taking delivery of Apaches . 
Support For The [MISC US-Turkey-Iraq  ] " [ORG Tripartite Security Dialogue  ] " --------------------------------------------- ---------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( S ) [ORG SecDef  ] 's visit will take place just as [ORG USFI  ] 's [PER GEN Odierno  ] will have left . 
We expect that [PER GEN Odierno  ] 's visit will give a political boost to the [ORG U.S.-Turkey-Iraq Tripartite Security  ] talks . 
[LOC Turkey  ] 's civilian leaders are taking heat from their domestic political opposition for pressing the " [MISC Kurdish Opening  ] " while casualties from [ORG PKK  ] attacks continue . 
They hope to use GEN [PER Odierno  ] 's visit to show that their whole-of-government approach against [ORG PKK  ] insurgency is producing results and that it has the support of senior [ORG USG  ] officials in [LOC Iraq.  ] <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( S ) Trilateral meetings continue regularly and a new [ORG Tripartite  ] operational office in [LOC Erbil  ] , established to share counter-PKK intelligence was established over the summer . 
The most recent tri-lat meeting took place in [LOC Baghdad  ] in December , followed by a joint [MISC Turkey-Iraq  ] visit in [LOC Erbil  ] . 
The [LOC Turks  ] remain frustrated that , in their view , the [ORG KRG  ] is not doing enough to combat the [ORG PKK  ] . 
The [LOC Turks  ] remain shy in sharing intelligence data ; they are not convinced that they can trust [MISC Iraqi/Kurdish  ] individuals to keep information concerning operations secret . 
[MISC Turkish  ] officials have become more strident in their calls for [ORG KRG  ] officials to take action against the [ORG PKK  ] . 
The cooperation that does exist is a step in the right direction ; however , it will need to improve significantly prior to the [LOC U.S.  ] pullout of [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[PER CHOD Basbug  ] and PM Ergodan want the [LOC U.S.  ] to put more pressure on the [MISC Iraqis  ] - and particularly [PER Masoud Barzani  ] - to take actions to cut [ORG PKK  ] supply and logistics lines in northern [LOC Iraq  ] . 
We should stress the need for more trust and collaboration between [LOC Turkey  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] , eventually on [MISC Turkish  ] CBOs . 
Absent greater cooperation , we could see significant bilateral problems post-2011 , to include [MISC Iraqi  ] claims of [LOC Turkey  ] 's violation of its sovereign territory . 
Northern [LOC Iraq  ] -------------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [LOC Turkey  ] will not consider any alternative to the political unity and territorial integrity of [LOC Iraq  ] , but has become more flexible on how it engages " the local authorities of northern [LOC Iraq  ] " ( how [LOC Turkey  ] refers officially to the [MISC Kurdish  ] [LOC Regional Government  ] ( [ORG KRG  ] ) ) . 
[LOC Turkey  ] 's policy remains focused on the government in [LOC Baghdad  ] , but its outreach to the [ORG KRG  ] is expanding . 
This outreach is reinforced by the continued dominance of [MISC Turkish  ] products and investments in the [ORG KRG  ] 's healthy economy . 
[LOC Armenia  ] ------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( S ) The signing of the Protocols to reestablish [MISC Turkish-Armenian  ] relations and open the common border in [LOC Zurich  ] on October 10 was a landmark for the region . 
However , neither [LOC Turkey  ] nor [LOC Armenia  ] have taken steps toward ratification ; the [ORG GOT  ] argues that progress toward withdrawal of [MISC Armenian  ] forces from [MISC Azerbaijani  ] provinces surrounding [LOC Nagorno-Karabakh  ] is a pre-condition . 
( Note: This was not/not part of the agreement , and not a position the [LOC U.S.  ] supports . 
End note . 
) Future relations will nevertheless still be heavily linked to the 1915 " [MISC Armenian  ] genocide " issue . 
Any [LOC U.S.  ] determination of the events of 1915 as " genocide " would set off a political firestorm in [LOC Turkey  ] , and the effect on our bilateral relationship -- including political , military , and commercial aspects -- would be devastating . 
[LOC Israel  ] ------ <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) While the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] and the [MISC Turkish  ] General Staff agree with us that a strong [MISC Turkey-Israel  ] relationship is essential for regional stability , PM [PER Erdogan  ] has sought to shore up his domestic right flank through continued populist rhetoric against [LOC Israel  ] and its December 2008 [LOC Gaza  ] operation . 
His outburst at [LOC Davos  ] and the last-minute cancellation of [LOC Israel  ] 's participation in the Fall 2009 Anatolian Eagle Exercise ( a multilateral [ORG Air Force  ] exercise which had [LOC US  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] , [LOC Italy  ] , and [LOC Israel  ] as planned participants ) were the most noticeable examples of this rhetoric , which we and his staff have sought to contain . 
The latest incident , a snub in early January of the [MISC Turkish  ] Ambassador by [MISC Israeli  ] Deputy Foreign Minster [PER Danny Ayalon  ] , almost caused the [ORG GOT  ] to both recall its Ambassador and cancel the visit of [MISC Israeli  ] Defense Minister [PER Ehud Barak  ] . 
However , the very public row was resolved with an [MISC Israeli  ] apology and [PER Barak  ] 's visit on January 17 helped to stem the downward spiral for now . 
Nevertheless , we assess that [PER Erdogan  ] is likely to continue anti-Israel remarks and the issues will continue to cast a shadow on the [MISC TU-IS  ] bilateral relationship . 
Political Environment --------------------- <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) PM [PER Erdogan  ] 's [ORG Islamist-leaning Justice and Development  ] ( [ORG AK  ] ) Party remains [LOC Turkey  ] 's strongest political party , but its poll numbers are slumping , and it continues to fear an erosion of its political base from more conservative/Islamist parties . 
Civilian-military relations remain complex . 
Chief of Staff General [PER Basbug  ] has worked out a modus vivendi with PM [PER Erdogan  ] , but the long-running struggle between [LOC Turkey  ] 's secularists ( with the [ORG Army  ] as its champion ) and [MISC Islamists  ] ( represented by the government ) naturally puts them at odds . 
[PER Erdogan  ] has the clear upper hand , a fact with which [PER Basbug  ] has seemingly learned to live . 
Alleged past military involvement in coup contingency planning or even deliberate generation of internal chaos remains political theme number one and preoccupies both [PER Erdogan  ] and [PER Basbug  ] and their respective underlings . 
Public trust in the military is starting to decline , the result of several very public on-going investigations into the alleged planning against the government .
