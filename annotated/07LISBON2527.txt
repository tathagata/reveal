( C ) On September 21 , newly-arrived [MISC British  ] Ambassador [PER Alexander Wykeham Ellis  ] informed Ambassador [PER Hoffman  ] that [MISC European  ] concerns over [MISC Russia’s  ] aggressive energy policies and the need for market competition were the driving forces behind the third [ORG EU  ] energy liberalization package . 
He suggested that [MISC Russia’s  ] position with its neighbors was guided by a self-proclaimed right to do “what it wants , when it wants” in its own neighborhood . 
Regarding [PER Robert Mugabe’s  ] participation in the proposed [LOC EU-Africa Summit  ] , [PER Ellis  ] said the [LOC UK  ] would not discourage other member states from participating if PM Brown stayed away . 
He doubted , however , if the [MISC Dutch  ] , [MISC Irish  ] , or [MISC Swedish  ] would attend in [MISC Brown’s  ] absence . 
[PER Ellis  ] also noted that it was the [MISC British  ] police that developed the current evidence against [PER Madeleine McCann’s  ] parents in the high-profile case that has captured international attention . 
He informed the Ambassador that former [MISC British  ] Ambassador [PER John Buck  ] had accepted a private-sector position at a [LOC UK  ] gas company and that his departure had nothing to do with bilateral issues . 
END SUMMARY [MISC RUSSIA’S  ] ENERGY GAME IS COMING TO AN END ---------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) According to [PER Ellis  ] , [MISC European  ] concerns over [MISC Russia’s  ] aggressive energy policies and the need for increased market competition were the driving forces behind the third [ORG EU  ] energy liberalization package . 
He called [LOC Russia  ] the greatest threat to [MISC European  ] energy security and described its energy policies as a “game that’s coming to an end.” He argued that Gazprom’s sustainability depends on the [MISC European  ] distribution network and that [PER Putin  ] , who is “always trying to make a point to [LOC Europe  ] , ” knew and understood this reality . 
Quoting a statement he had heard elsewhere , [PER Ellis  ] described [LOC Russia  ] as “too strong , too weak” ; suggesting that it was a bipolar society divided by feelings of strength and empowerment and internal fears of national failure . 
[LOC RUSSIA  ] , THE BIG BAD NEIGHBOR ---------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) When questioned about [LOC Kosovo  ] and [MISC Russia’s  ] relationship with its neighbors , [PER Ellis  ] suggested that [MISC Russia’s  ] position ( on [LOC Kosovo  ] ) was driven by a self-proclaimed right to do “what it wants , when it wants” in its own neighborhood . 
[PER Ellis  ] did not believe that [LOC Russia  ] had high regard for [LOC Serbia  ] or any of its other neighbors , but rather it feared outside influences in the region . 
Reflecting on his position as Director of the [ORG EU Enlargement Team  ] in [LOC London  ] ( 2001-2003 ) , [PER Ellis  ] noted that completing the 2004 [ORG EU  ] enlargement phase had been difficult , and hypothesized that if the [LOC Russia  ] of now were the [LOC Russia  ] of then , the process would have been nearly impossible . 
MUGABE...AND THE OTHER BAD GUYS ------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) According to [PER Ellis  ] , the [MISC UK’s  ] position on [LOC Zimbabwe  ] has not changed ; if [PER Robert Mugabe  ] showed up , then [PER Gordon Brown  ] would not . 
However , he could not confirm if the [MISC British  ] government would send any representatives . 
While he claimed that the [LOC UK  ] had steered away from discouraging other member stated from attending , he noted the possibility that the [MISC Dutch  ] , [MISC Irish  ] , and [MISC Swedish  ] leaders may follow [MISC Brown’s  ] lead . 
Regarding [PER Chavez  ] and [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , [PER Ellis  ] commented that Portugal’s approach was centered on “engagement” -- even with the so-called bad guys . 
Ambassador [PER Hoffman  ] countered that “irrational people cannot be expected to behave rationally.” While acknowledging that the [LOC US  ] position was justifiable , [PER Ellis  ] responded that there were sensitivities at play for [LOC Portugal  ] , especially regarding [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
( Note: There are approximately a half-million [MISC Portuguese  ] living in [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
End Note ) THE MADELEINE MCCANN CASE ------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Madeleine McCann’s  ] disappearance in the south of [LOC Portugal  ] in May 2007 has generated international media attention with controversy surrounding the [MISC Portuguese-led  ] police investigation and the actions of [MISC Madeleine’s  ] parents . 
Without delving into the details of the case , [PER Ellis  ] admitted that the [MISC British  ] police had developed the current evidence against the McCann parents , and he stressed that authorities from both countries were working cooperatively . 
He commented that the media frenzy was to be expected and was acceptable as long as government officials keep their comments behind closed doors . 
[ORG BIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION  ] ----------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 .
