( C ) Poloff contacted MFA Deputy Director General for [LOC Mexico  ] , [LOC Central America  ] , and the [ORG Caribbean Pedro Gomez  ] de [PER Olea  ] on 10/7 to discuss reports that the [MISC Spanish  ] Embassy in [LOC Havana  ] was planning to break with [ORG EU  ] policy by not inviting dissidents to its national day reception on 10/12 . 
[ORG Gomez  ] de [PER Olea  ] , who had clearly anticipated poloff 's call , said he had no information to provide because the decision on whether to invite dissidents would be made by Foreign Minister [PER Moratinos  ] himself . 
He said that , to his knowledge , no final decision had been made. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG Gomez  ] de [PER Olea  ] ( please protect ) indicated a certain exasperation with the issue , saying it had been his understanding that the [ORG GOS  ] would comply with [ORG EU  ] policies calling for the inclusion of national day event , but that it now seemed FM [PER Moratinos  ] felt he had to make the decision himself . 
[ORG Gomez  ] de [PER Olea  ] said it was likely no decision would be made until right before the 10/12 event and that he would likely learn of it at the same time we did . 
He added that it was well known that the [ORG GOS  ] wanted to revisit [ORG EU  ] measures against the [ORG GOC  ] to find " more effective " tools , but his tone suggested frustration with the way in which the issue of invitations is being handled by FM [MISC Moratinos.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Poloff inquired about the accuracy of news reports that [MISC Cuban  ] FM [PER Perez Roque  ] had told [PER Moratinos  ] in [LOC New York  ] that noted political prisoner [PER Raul Rivero  ] would not be released if [LOC Spain  ] invited dissidents to its national day event , comments which [ORG Popular Party  ] politicians denounced as blackmail . 
[ORG Gomez  ] de [PER Olea  ] scoffed , saying that [PER Perez Roque  ] had not made such a statement , but that in fact his comments were even " more insulting " than those reported . 
He said [PER Perez Roque  ] demanded not only the lifting of [ORG EU  ] measures undertaken in the wake of the 2003 [ORG GOC  ] crackdown on dissident , but also the full revision of the [ORG EU  ] Common Position to remove all [MISC European  ] political conditions on improved ties with [LOC Cuba.  ] //CUBAN ANTI-EMBARGO RESOLUTION// <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Poloff took advantage of the conversation to review ref D points regarding the upcoming [LOC Cuba  ] embargo resolution . 
[ORG Gomez  ] de [PER Olea  ] said [LOC Spain  ] would hew closely to past [ORG EU  ] practice , including voting in favor of the [MISC Cuban  ] resolution while criticizing [ORG GOC  ] human rights practices in an Explanation of Vote . 
This was [ORG GOS  ] policy under the [ORG Aznar Government  ] as well . 
We will follow up by delivering ref D points to the MFA Office of [ORG UN Affairs.  ] //COMMENT// <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG Moratinos'  ] positions on [LOC Cuba  ] continue to undermine the [ORG Zapatero Administration  ] 's contention that human rights will remain on the forefront of [ORG GOS  ] policy towards [LOC Cuba  ] . 
Instead , [PER Moratinos  ] appears to favor " dialogue at any cost " with respect to [LOC Cuba  ] and seems willing to risk the ire of both the [ORG EU  ] and the [ORG USG  ] in order to improve relations with the [ORG GOC  ] . 
Even if [PER Moratinos  ] does opt to invite dissidents , this episode makes it abundantly clear that the [ORG GOS  ] will continue to chip away at [ORG EU  ] resolve to hold the [ORG GOC  ] to at least minimal human rights standards . 
Given [MISC Spanish  ] public opposition to [LOC U.S.  ] policy towards [LOC Cuba  ] , the [ORG Zapatero Government  ] could be tempted to portray any rapprochement with [LOC Havana  ] as yet another demonstration of its " independence " f</pre></code>
