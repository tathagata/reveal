The Ambassador stressed that this initiative was a routine adjustment to ongoing contingency planning , that military and geographic logic dictated that the defense of [LOC Poland  ] include the defense of the [MISC Baltic  ] states , and that this initiative , as with other [ORG NATO  ] planning , should remain in restricted [ORG NATO  ] circles and was not for public consumption . 
He explained that work on this initiative should start immediately in January following NATO’s winter break. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [MISC SecGen  ] was extremely pleased by the [LOC U.S.  ] support for an approach that would meet a legitimate demand by three [ORG NATO  ] Allies . 
[LOC Poland  ] more cautiously agreed with the approach so long as it did not delay completion of the [MISC Poland-related  ] portion of [ORG EAGLE GUARDIAN  ] . 
The [MISC Baltic  ] PermRemps were grateful for this initiative , and stressed the need to ensure this would be a real plan to defend their countries rather than a simple appendage to the [LOC Poland  ] contingency plan . 
They understood the need to keep this issue within [ORG NATO  ] , and asked for guidance in responding to public inquiries . 
Ambassador [PER Daalder  ] shared with the [MISC Baltic  ] PermReps reftel points on press inquiries . 
They agreed to adopt a uniform press response. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) Ambassador [PER Daalder  ] acknowledged in these meetings that [LOC Germany  ] had initiated the proposal for expanding [ORG EAGLE GUARDIAN  ] to include the [MISC Baltic  ] states . 
The [MISC German  ] PermRep noted that the [MISC German  ] Chancellery and [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] had signed off on this approach , and [ORG MFA  ] approval should come after FM Westerwelle’s full briefing on this issue .
