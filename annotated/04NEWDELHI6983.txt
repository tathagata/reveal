The decision to encourage democracy in [LOC Rangoon  ] reflects the [ORG GOI  ] belief that [LOC India  ] is best placed to help [LOC Burma  ] reform , that [PER Aung San Sui  ] ’s “time has come and gone , ” and that democracy will take root in [LOC Burma  ] only through greater engagement and people-to-people ties .

PolCouns stressed our concerns about the safety and treatment of [LOC ASSK  ] and the democratic opposition under Burma’s new Prime Minister ( ref A ) , and urged [LOC India  ] to continue to press for democratic reform in [LOC Rangoon  ] . 
End Summary . 
Democracy --------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Democracy topped India’s agenda for the October 24-29 visit of Burma’s military leader [PER Than Shwe  ] , MEA Joint Secretary ( [LOC South East  ] Asia - I ) [PER Mitra Vashishta  ] told PolCouns [ORG SIPDIS  ] and Poloff on November 1 . 
Prime Minister [PER Manmohan Singh  ] himself raised the issue with [PER Than Shwe  ] “in a much more intense way than could be expressed” in the media , she said , noting that [LOC India  ] had decided to raise the issue of democracy with [LOC Burma  ] despite potentially negative consequences for the relationship . 
[PER Vashishta  ] reported that [LOC New Delhi  ] had to battle for the inclusion of a joint statement paragraph emphasizing India’s desire to see “a stable , peaceful , prosperous and democratic [MISC Myanmar.” She  ] commented that the [MISC Burmese  ] delegation was “willing to do anything” to have that paragraph removed , adding that the inclusion of the paragraph was a “coup for [LOC India.”  ] The final version of the document released on October 29 “expressed support for national reconciliation and an early transition to democracy in [MISC Myanmar.”  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Asked about [LOC New Delhi’s  ] plan to further encourage democracy in [LOC Burma  ] , [PER Vashishta  ] responded that [LOC Rangoon  ] considers [LOC India  ] a democratic role model , and emphasized that the [ORG GOI  ] has the “best credentials” to promote democracy there . 
She mused that democracy could only be established through grass-roots initiatives , and stressed that [LOC India  ] would do “whatever it takes” to empower the people of [LOC Burma  ] in this respect . 
Referring to the increased people-to-people ties between [LOC India  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] , [PER Vashishta  ] said that the [ORG GOI  ] plans to pursue a similar strategy with [LOC Burma  ] by promoting culture and sports links between the two countries. “We are much less bothered by the situation in [LOC Burma  ] than in [LOC Pakistan  ] , ” she noted , adding that she would welcome [LOC US  ] suggestions on how to encourage greater reform in [LOC Rangoon.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) According to [PER Vashishta  ] , democracy in [LOC Burma  ] is too closely linked with the greatly respected [PER Aung San Sui Kyi  ] ( [LOC ASSK  ] ) , whose “day has come and gone.” She said that [PER Than Shwe  ] had expressed a commitment to democracy during the visit , and speculated that he would be more apt to bring about democratic reform if he could do so without losing face . 
PolCouns underlined [LOC US  ] concerns about the lack of democracy in [LOC Burma  ] and expressed the hope that [LOC India  ] would continue to press this issue with the junta . 
Engaging [LOC Burma  ] , Meeting India’s Strategic Needs --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Describing the [PER Than Shwe  ] trip as “entirely devoted to India’s interests , ” [PER Vashishta  ] stated that [LOC New Delhi  ] decided to proceed with the visit , even after the ouster of former-PM [PER Khin Nyunt  ] because the [ORG GOI  ] did not view the replacement of [PER Nyunt  ] as an indication of “which way the dust would fall” on democracy . 
The [ORG GOI  ] believes the coup was an “internal struggle , ” she said , speculating that the junta may be somewhat fragile . 
As evidence , [PER Vashishta  ] observed that [PER Than Shwe  ] traveled with the wives of two other powerful generals , [PER Thura Shwe Man  ] and [PER Soe Win  ] , who she mused may have been used as “hostages” to ensure tranquillity among the generals in [LOC Rangoon  ] during [PER Than Shwe’s  ] absence. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Vashishta  ] reiterated India’s belief that only constructive engagement of the military regime could bring about any meaningful change , saying sanctions have only isolated [LOC Burma  ] , and have not encouraged democratic reforms there . 
[LOC Burma  ] is so isolated that members of [PER Than Shwe’s  ] delegation wondered whether they would have to “go nuclear” to get [LOC US  ] attention , she remarked , noting the comparison to [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
She emphasized that if [LOC India  ] also isolates [LOC Burma  ] , no one will be able to engage [LOC Rangoon  ] on democracy or other issues. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Flagging that the timing of [ORG UN Special Envoy for Burma Razali Ismail’s  ] October 29-31 visit to [LOC New Delhi  ] was not coincidental , [PER Vashishta  ] expressed India’s desire to work with the [ORG UN  ] on [LOC Burma  ] . 
However , she argued that the organization “has lost credibility” in the eyes of developing countries and should at least make an attempt to be more “pro-Myanmar.” The [ORG EU  ] is too “obvious , shabby , shortsighted and full of contradictions” to play a meaningful role in [LOC Burma  ] , she argued , while [LOC Thailand  ] takes a pro-active approach to [LOC Rangoon  ] only “because one of their ministers wants to be the next [ORG UN  ] Secretary [PER General.” Counter-Terrorism  ] Agreement --------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Billing  ] the Memorandum of Understanding on “Non-Traditional Security Issues” as an agreement on counter terrorism “whatever they call it , ” [PER Vashishta  ] said the [ORG MOU  ] outlines Rangoon’s obligations to crack-down on anti-India militants operating out of [MISC Burmese  ] territory . 
The [ORG GOI  ] does not believe that [LOC Rangoon  ] is fueling the insurgents to pressure [LOC New Delhi  ] because “it is not in Burma’s strategic interest , ” but [LOC New Delhi  ] is growing increasingly concerned about insurgent activities in the border regions . 
The [ORG GOB  ] agreed to move troops to the [MISC Indo-Burmese  ] border “not because of their interests , but because some of India’s interests are now tied up with theirs , ” [PER Vashishta  ] said , citing economic development as an example . 
She expressed optimism that [LOC Burma  ] was taking India’s request seriously , unlike in the past . 
She noted that [PER Soe Win  ] , Burma’s new PM , had previously commanded forces along the border with [LOC India  ] . 
PolCouns stressed our concerns about the safety and treatment of [LOC ASSK  ] and the democratic opposition , given Soe [MISC Win’s  ] direct involvement in the May 30 , 2003 attack on [LOC ASSK  ] and her followers ( ref A ) . 
[PER Vashishta  ] had different information , alleging that some of the opposition parties were hopeful about a near-term political opening . 
No To Military Exercises , Yes To [MISC Grants ---------------------------------------  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Although the [ORG India-Burma  ] joint statement on [PER Than Shwe’s  ] visit mentions the “possibilities of expanding cooperation” in defense , [PER Vashishta  ] categorically stated that joint military exercises “are absolutely ruled out , ” saying this is “a big , firm no.” She indicated the [ORG GOI  ] could provide limited military equipment to [LOC Rangoon  ] , “on par with what the rest of [ORG ASEAN  ] provides , ” but is “very careful” when it comes to military cooperation with [LOC Burma  ] . 
10 . 
( C ) [PER Vashishta  ] confirmed plans to provide [LOC Burma  ] with a USD 20 million dollar grant to be used for energy , gas , and upgrading refining facilities , and said the money would be used to entice [LOC Rangoon  ] to reform . 
She explained that the junta would not receive the funds unless “they do certain things , ” saying that [LOC India  ] hopes to “engage them ( with the grant ) and slowly lay down conditions for reform.” She cast this as part of [MISC New Delhi’s  ] people-to-people strategy . 
[LOC China  ] ----- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Expressing concern about [MISC Chinese  ] influence in [LOC Burma  ] , [PER Vashishta  ] said that the [ORG State Peace and Development Council  ] ( [ORG SPDC  ] ) has been “learning from the master about how to hoodwink the international community” on human rights . 
She said that [LOC China  ] would like an [LOC Indian Ocean  ] port and hopes to project its influence “everywhere [LOC India  ] does.” [PER Vashishta  ] argued that “what you hear about the [LOC PLA  ] in [LOC Burma  ] is only the tip of the iceberg , ” as [LOC US  ] intelligence must know . 
[MISC Burmese  ] engagement with [LOC India  ] stems in part from Rangoon’s belief that “China takes them for granted , ” she asserted . 
Religion -------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Commenting on the delegation’s visit to several important [MISC Buddhist  ] shrines in [LOC India  ] , [PER Vashishta  ] noted that over the last three years , [PER Than Shwe  ] had repeatedly requested a pilgrimage to the sites and speculated that the religious journey was a major factor behind the trip . 
She claimed that this pilgrimage was not just aimed a burnishing the junta’s [MISC Buddhist  ] credentials , but rather was related to [PER Than Shwe’s  ] personal sense of mortality . 
But she added , the [MISC Burmese  ] military did not think they had done anything wrong , and do not need to atone for their sins . 
Comment ------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Led by Foreign Secretary [PER Saran  ] , a former Ambassador to [LOC Rangoon  ] , the [ORG GOI  ] has embarked on a major diplomatic initiative with [LOC Burma  ] . 
India’s policy toward the [ORG GOB  ] is pragmatic , based largely on [LOC New Delhi’s  ] security interests , but also reflects the [MISC GOI’s  ] desire eventually to see a democratic [LOC Burma  ] to its east . 
[LOC India  ] has welcomed [LOC US  ] input about how best to encourage democracy there , presenting an opportunity that we should seize upon to expand the [LOC US-India  ] regional dialogue to include developments in [LOC Rangoon  ] .
