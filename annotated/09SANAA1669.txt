( [ORG S/NF  ] ) SUMMARY .

END SUMMARY . 
" [ORG OPEN LAND  ] , AIR , AND [LOC SEA  ] " FOR [LOC U.S.  ] STRIKES AGAINST [ORG AQAP  ] --------------------------------------------- ---------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In a September 6 meeting with [ORG Deputy National Security Advisor John Brennan  ] , President [PER Saleh  ] insisted that [LOC Yemen  ] 's national territory is available for unilateral [LOC CT  ] operations by the [LOC U.S.  ] Dissatisfied with current levels of [ORG USG  ] funding and military training provided to the [ORG ROYG  ] 's [LOC CT  ] forces , [PER Saleh  ] asserted that the [ORG USG  ] has produced " only words , but no solutions " to the terrorism issue in [LOC Yemen  ] . 
[PER Saleh  ] repeatedly requested more funds and equipment to fight al-Qaeda in the [LOC Arabian Peninsula  ] ( [ORG AQAP  ] ) , while at the same time placing responsibility for any future [ORG AQAP  ] attacks on the shoulders of the [ORG USG  ] now that it enjoys unfettered access to [MISC Yemeni  ] airspace , coastal waters and land . 
( NOTE . 
The [ORG USG  ] has been actively engaged since 2001 in training elements of [LOC Yemen  ] 's [LOC CT  ] forces , including the [ORG Counter-Terrorism Unit  ] ( [ORG CTU  ] ) , the [ORG Yemen Special Operations Force  ] ( [ORG YSOF  ] ) , the [ORG Presidential Guard  ] , the [MISC Yemeni  ] [ORG Border Troops  ] , [ORG Yemen Air Force  ] ( [ORG YAF  ] ) , and the [ORG Yemen Coast Guard  ] ( [ORG YCG  ] ) . 
The [ORG USG  ] has expended over $115 million equipping [LOC CT  ] forces since FY02 . 
In 2009 alone , [LOC U.S.  ] teams have instructed [MISC Yemeni  ] [LOC CT  ] forces in training valued at $5 million . 
END NOTE . 
) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) While [PER Saleh  ] offered assurances that the [ORG ROYG  ] is " determined to continue the war against al-Qaeda because they're targeting [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Yemeni  ] interests , " he continued to link increased [LOC U.S.  ] access to [ORG AQAP  ] targets with full responsibility for achieving [LOC CT  ] goals . 
Highlighting the potential for a future [ORG AQAP  ] attack on the [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy or other [MISC Western  ] targets , [PER Saleh  ] said , " I have given you an open door on terrorism , so I am not responsible . 
" THE [MISC SA'ADA WAR:  ] " THE [MISC HOUTHIS ARE YOUR ENEMIES TOO  ] " --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) President [PER Saleh  ] expressed his frustration with the [ORG USG  ] refusal to view the [LOC Sa'ada  ] war against the al-Houthis in the north in the same light as the fight against [ORG AQAP  ] . 
Claiming a need for increased aid and support , [PER Saleh  ] asserted that " this war we're launching is a war on behalf of the [PER U.S....the Houthis  ] are your enemies too , " citing videos of al-Houthi followers chanting , " Death to [LOC Israel  ] , death to [LOC America  ] . 
" ( NOTE: The [PER Houthis  ] have not attacked [LOC U.S.  ] interests or personnel in the six rounds of fighting between the [ORG ROYG  ] and the [PER Houthis  ] that began in 2004 . 
END NOTE . 
) The [ORG USG  ] 's failure to view the [PER Houthis  ] as terrorists and equip [ORG ROYG  ] forces to fight them in [LOC Sa'ada  ] undermines the [ORG USG  ] 's claims of friendship and cooperation , according to [PER Saleh  ] . 
Commenting on the status of [ORG ROYG  ] forces in [LOC Sa'ada  ] , [PER Saleh  ] said , " we are suffering a lot of casualties and loss of material . 
" Renewing his requests for armored personnel vehicles , aircraft , and medical evacuation vehicles , [PER Saleh  ] echoed his criticism of [LOC U.S.  ] efforts . 
" We need deeds , not only words , " he said . 
[PER Brennan  ] responded that the [ORG USG  ] is prohibited by law from providing military support to the [ORG ROYG  ] to be used against the [PER Houthis  ] since the [ORG USG  ] considers the group a domestic insurgency. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Restating claims of [MISC Iranian  ] support to the [MISC Houthi  ] movement , [ORG ROYG  ] officials present said they had provided files supporting an [MISC Iranian-Houthi  ] connection to [ORG USG  ] officials and would provide more if necessary . 
( NOTE . 
The Ambassador acknowledged receiving a file that was reviewed here and in [LOC Washington  ] ; however , no conclusive evidence of an [MISC Iranian-Houthi  ] link has been made from these or other records . 
[PER Brennan  ] said that he would request a fresh scrub of all available intelligence to see if it turned up any evidence of [MISC Iranian  ] involvement . 
END NOTE . 
) [PER Saleh  ] said , " [LOC Iran  ] is trying to settle old scores against the [LOC U.S.  ] by ruining relations between [LOC Yemen  ] and [ORG GCC  ] countries and the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" He also made a tangential reference to [ORG Hezbollah  ] , claiming the organization 's influence in the region also rendered the [MISC ROYG-Houthi  ] war a fight on behalf of the [LOC U.S.  ] Referencing the high poverty rate and illicit arms flows into both [LOC Yemen  ] and [LOC Somalia  ] , [PER Saleh  ] concluded by saying , " If you don't help , this country will become worse than [LOC Somalia  ] . 
" MUDDLED MESSAGES ON GUANTANAMO DETAINEES ---------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Saleh  ] expressed his preference for the existing [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] option as a potential site for rehabilitating [LOC Guantanamo  ] detainees of [MISC Yemeni  ] origin over a proposed [MISC Jordanian  ] option , citing closer familial ties and cultural bonds in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] as mechanisms for more effective treatment . 
[PER Saleh  ] commented that he thought the [MISC Jordanians  ] were &too poor8 to support a rehabilitation program , but did not dismiss [LOC Jordan  ] as an option . 
However , he signaled that rehabilitation is not his concern , but rather " the [LOC U.S  ] . 
's problem " as he is ready and willing to accept all [MISC Yemeni  ] detainees into the [MISC Yemeni  ] prison system . 
( COMMENT . 
[PER Saleh  ] would , in our judgment , be unable to hold returning detainees in jail for any more than a matter of weeks before public pressure ) or the courts ) forced their release . 
END COMMENT . 
) [PER Saleh  ] urged the [ORG USG  ] to design and implement a rehabilitation and education program for the detainees and to build a rehabilitation center in [LOC Yemen  ] , but reiterated that the [LOC U.S.  ] would have to fund these projects , repeatedly asking , " How many dollars is the [LOC U.S.  ] going to bring ? 
" However , when [PER Brennan  ] offered $500,000 as an initial investment currently available for the crafting of a rehabilitation program , [PER Saleh  ] dismissed the offer as insufficient . 
[PER Saleh  ] also assured [PER Brennan  ] that he was committed to " freeing the innocent people after a complete and total rehabilitation , " suggesting a lack of clarity on his own policy and on the status of [LOC Guantanamo  ] detainees in the [ORG ROYG  ] legal system . 
ECONOMIC REFORM AND CORRUPTION ------------------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Saleh  ] welcomed the letter from President [PER Obama  ] that [PER Brennan  ] hand-carried , and expressed appreciation for [LOC U.S.  ] concern over the stability and economic hardships facing the country . 
He agreed to move forward with the 10-point plan outlining necessary economic reforms ( reftel ) but did not provide details regarding dates or implementation goals . 
Responding to [PER Brennan  ] 's concerns that economic and other assistance might be diverted through corrupt officials to other purposes , [PER Saleh  ] urged the [LOC U.S.  ] to donate supplies and hardware rather than liquid funds in order to curb corruption 's reach . 
[PER Saleh  ] also told [LOC US  ] officials that they could have full access to financial records to ensure proper usage of donor funding . 
( COMMENT . 
[PER Saleh  ] 's preference for infrastructure and equipment over cash displays a lack of confidence in his own regime 's ability to handle liquid assets and hardly provides a viable solution for stemming the curb of corruption in the long run . 
END COMMENT . 
) VISIT TO [LOC WASHINGTON  ] & OTHER ISSUES ---------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Saleh  ] again asked to visit the [LOC U.S.  ] , arguing that it was necessary to resolve issues regarding the [LOC Guantanamo  ] detainees and increased military assistance . 
" We see this visit as very important to reach mutual understanding and so that you understand our requests and demands . 
" [PER Brennan  ] undertook to look into [PER Saleh  ] 's claims of " promised " military equipment that has not been delivered . 
In a one-on-one session that followed the formal meeting , [PER Brennan  ] extended an invitation to [PER Saleh  ] to meet President [PER Obama  ] at the [LOC White House  ] on October 6 . 
[PER Saleh  ] also stated that there would be no more delays in the [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy 's request to purchase lands for the building of more secure housing facilities and that the [ORG Shari'a Council  ] would approve the transfer of the lands from waqf ( or publicly held ) status to free-hold status . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) COMMENT . 
[PER Saleh  ] was in vintage form during the two hours he spent with [PER DNSA Brennan  ] , at times disdainful and dismissive and at others , conciliatory and congenial . 
One might easily conclude that his repeated assertion that [LOC Yemen  ] 's national territory is open to the [LOC US  ] to conduct operations against [ORG AQAP  ] reflects his interest in outsourcing the [LOC CT  ] effort in [LOC Yemen  ] to the [ORG USG  ] , especially in view of his somewhat ominous claim that , should [ORG AQAP  ] attacks occur in the future , they will be the result of the [LOC U.S.  ] having failed to do enough to put the organization out of business . 
Additionally , a concerted [ORG USG  ] anti-terrorism campaign in [LOC Yemen  ] will free [PER Saleh  ] to continue to devote his limited security assets to the ongoing war against [MISC Houthi  ] rebels in [LOC Sa'ada  ] . 
The net effect , and one we strongly suspect [PER Saleh  ] has calculated , of both the [MISC American  ] and [ORG ROYG  ] " iron fist " unleashed at the same time in [LOC Yemen  ] will be a clear message to the southern movement or any other party interested in generating political unrest in the country that a similar fate awaits them. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) COMMENT CONTINUED . 
Not surprisingly , [PER Saleh  ] was far less animated when [PER Brennan  ] attempted to focus his attention on the need for immediate action to relieve [LOC Yemen  ] 's deteriorating socio-economic situation , largely limiting his response to a pitch that the [ORG USG  ] persuade recalcitrant donors to speed up and increase their assistance to [LOC Yemen  ] . 
After stating petulantly in the group session that he was no longer interested in an invitation to the [LOC White House  ] , telling [PER Brennan  ] that " my relationship with you is sufficient , " [PER Saleh  ] 's mood changed noticeably for the better when the invitation was extended , and he had captured the prize he has been chasing after for months . 
END COMMENT .
