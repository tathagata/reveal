( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] and Deputy Ambassador [PER Ricciardone  ] demarched President [PER Karzai  ] and his inner circle on the problems of the final version of the electoral decree February 24-25 , stressing the need for an independent [ORG Electoral Complaints Commission  ] with international commissioners , protection of the vetting process , and change in [ORG Independent Electoral Commission  ] ( [ORG IEC  ] ) leadership . 
They cautioned that a successful [LOC U.S.  ] visit hangs in the balance . 
End Summary. --------------------------------------------- ---------- To the [ORG Advisors: Protect Democracy  ] and the Relationship --------------------------------------------- ---------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) On February 24 , Deputy Ambassador [PER Ricciardone  ] separately called on Presidential Chief of Staff [PER Omer Daudzai  ] , Education Minister ( recently named as the [MISC Peace Jirga  ] coordinator ) [PER Farouk Wardak  ] and Agriculture Minister [PER Rahimi  ] . 
[PER Ricciardone  ] made the following points with each: -- the election issue is a potential spoiler to a successful [LOC U.S.  ] trip - and fixing it should be an urgent priority . 
Worse , it threatens to turn 2010 back into 2009 - derailing the strategic course agreed on and established from [LOC Karzai’s  ] inauguration through the [LOC London  ] conference. -- for elections to be credible the [ORG ECC  ] and [ORG IEC  ] cannot be seen to be in the pocket of the [LOC President.  ] -- what matters now is how [PER Karzai  ] acts on the [ORG IEC  ] , [ORG ECC  ] and candidate vetting process . 
He left a non-paper ( para 15 ) with [PER Daudzai  ] and [PER Wardak  ] , who promised to raise this issue “the [MISC Afghan  ] way.” <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Daudzai  ] made excuses for having “missed the import of the decree , ” which we had raised with him prospectively on February 8 . 
He said it had been discussed in the Cabinet but gotten changed before its final presentation . 
He had spoken to Karzai-supporting [MISC Parliamentarians  ] who were concerned about it and had told them to make their concerns public so the President understands . 
[PER Ricciardone  ] noted Parliament is confused over its right to review the decree , and this adds to our concerns about undue expansion of the President’s powers . 
[PER Daudzai  ] said he would add further Palace signals to Parliamentary leadership that they are empowered to review the decree . 
[PER Ricciardone  ] reiterated that this issue could undermine the prospective [PER Karzai  ] trip to the [LOC U.S.  ] by compelling [PER Karzai  ] to explain and defend his actions at every turn , rather than focusing on the strategic opportunities and challenges ahead of us in 2010 . 
[PER Karzai  ] must act in the next week or so ( on the items cited above ) in order to remove [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Afghan  ] concerns over the meaning of the decree . 
[PER Daudzai  ] alluded elliptically to his dinner meeting the previous evening with Minister of [ORG Interior Atmar  ] and other supporters of the President who shared “serious concerns” about [LOC Karzai’s  ] actions. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Minister of Education [PER Wardak  ] agreed that the decree gives [LOC Karzai’s  ] critics the evidence they want that he is not committed to democracy , and that it posed a serious problem in [LOC Karzai’s  ] standing abroad as well as at home . 
[PER Ricciardone  ] noted that [MISC Afghan  ] democracy would look different from other versions but that the foundation has to be based on credible institutions . 
He reiterated the need for changes at the [ORG IEC  ] , a “genuinely independent” [ORG ECC  ] , and a vetting process which can ensure no unreconstructed [ORG Taliban  ] are eligible for office . 
[PER Wardak  ] agreed with these points and claimed that our “inseparable partnership” would be greatly served by a good [LOC U.S.  ] visit . 
He promised to go directly to the President and to press [PER Karzai  ] to withdraw the decree in its entirety , and “improve it” before it is resubmitted . 
Frankly , [PER Wardak  ] said , this behavior was comparable to the power-grabs of the mujahedin in 1991-1992 - and he and [PER Zakhilwal  ] had already protested against it. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) On February 25 , Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] called on Minister of Finance [PER Omer Zakhilwal  ] who told him that he could “almost guarantee” that he could persuade [PER Karzai  ] to act as we had urged regarding the [ORG ECC  ] , candidate vetting , and [PER Ludin  ] , s replacement . 
He affirmed that the Ambassador was pursuing this agenda in the best way , by approaching [PER Karzai  ] clearly but respectfully and then allowing his inner circle of Ministers to prod him in the right direction . 
[PER Zakhilwal  ] noted that he was then meeting with [MISC Parliamentarians  ] on the issue of the Presidential decree and that he was building support and a case for the points that [PER Eikenberry  ] had raised. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Apparently echoing [PER Daudzai  ] , [PER Zakhilwal  ] went on to speak [LOC KABUL  ] 00000699 002 OF 004 candidly about [PER Karzai  ] , saying that he was an “extremely weak man” who did not listen to facts but was instead easily swayed by anyone who came to him to report even the most bizarre stories of plots against him . 
Whenever this happened , [PER Karzai  ] would immediately judge the person to be loyal and would reward him . 
He warned against former FM [PER Spanta  ] pursuing his narrow self-interest at the expense of national ones , but in general affirmed to [PER Eikenberry  ] that the “inner circle” -- now including [PER Daudzai  ] -- had decided they must collaborate to influence [PER Karzai  ] when they see him going astray on such matters . 
They reportedly pledged that if [PER Karzai  ] took umbrage at them raising such sensitive issues , they would defend each other. --------------------------------------------- --- Message to [PER Karzai: Don’t Put Success  ] on the Line --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Meeting with [PER Karzai  ] , [ORG National Security Advisor Spanta and Deputy NSA  ] Spinzada February 25 , Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] asked [PER Karzai  ] what he wanted his trip to be about and how he wanted it to be perceived in the [LOC United States  ] . 
He said he hoped it has become obvious to [PER Karzai  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] wants [PER Karzai  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] to be strong . 
[PER Eikenberry  ] noted that the success of the visit would require that [MISC Americans  ] to gain confidence that we have a reliable partner who is leading [LOC Afghanistan  ] forward. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Eikenberry  ] went on to explain that democracy-building in [LOC Afghanistan  ] could be among [PER Karzai  ] , s strongest legacies to the future and what he will be remembered for ; and democracy promotion is in [MISC America’s  ] “DNA” and how we judge institutional strength in any country . 
Reminding [PER Karzai  ] of the political risks our own President took on December 1 when he announced his strategy of deepened engagement in [LOC Afghanistan  ] in the face of very real domestic opposition , [PER Eikenberry  ] pointed out that [PER Karzai  ] has always reminded us of [MISC Afghanistan’s  ] domestic politics -- now it is his turn to be aware of [MISC American  ] domestic politics. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) At this point , before the planned one-on-one session , [PER Karzai  ] said he wanted [PER Spanta  ] to remain present . 
However , [PER Spanta  ] demurred , apparently sensing a difficult message would follow . 
Alone with [PER Karzai  ] , the Ambassador told [PER Karzai  ] that we want his visit to be about long-term strategic and political issues , including [PER Karzai  ] , s political vision and reintegration/reconciliation . 
It should lead us towards a stronger [LOC Afghanistan  ] and a stronger [PER Karzai  ] . 
[PER Eikenberry  ] said that the sooner [PER Karzai  ] addresses pressing issues like electoral reform , the sooner he can remove distractions from his agenda in [LOC Washington  ] . 
If he did nothing before his departure to allay our concerns about his decree and intent on electoral reform , he wouldn’t be able to talk about reintegration and reconciliation with [ORG Congress  ] , with the media , or with anyone in [LOC Washington  ] . 
[PER Karzai  ] said he wanted to speak in [LOC Washington  ] about “civilian casualties” but then added the long-term , strategic partnership as well. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) [PER Karzai  ] appeared more attentive and [PER Eikenberry  ] went into greater detail . 
He said that the election is very important for us and that if [MISC Americans  ] and our allies believe that [PER Karzai  ] is weakening in the building of democratic legitimacy in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , our support inevitably will weaken . 
He urged [PER Karzai  ] to make and announce well before departing for [LOC Washington  ] the needed changes regarding the [ORG Chair of the IEC  ] , placing internationals on the [ORG ECC  ] , and retaining internationals from [ORG UNAMA  ] and [ORG ISAF  ] as observers on the candidate vetting board ( DIAG ) . 
He asked [PER Karzai  ] if he had anyone else in mind for the [ORG IEC Chair  ] . 
[PER Karzai  ] said he did not and that he couldn’t make a “quick decision” about it . 
[PER Eikenberry  ] suggested that he could easily make an announcement prior to his visit to [LOC Washington  ] about having accepted [PER Ludin  ] , s resignation and having begun a talent search for [PER Ludin  ] , s replacement . 
[PER Karzai  ] agreed that that was something he “could” do and said he would meet with [PER Ludin  ] on February 27. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S ) [PER Eikenberry  ] continued that [PER Karzai  ] could also announce before his trip that he would be appointing two internationals to the [ORG ECC  ] to which [PER Karzai  ] , apparently confused about the law , said he could not make this announcement now , he could only form the [ORG ECC  ] three months before the election date . 
The Ambassador told [PER Karzai  ] he was mistaken on this point ( according to the new Presidential decree , the [ORG ECC  ] must be established no later than three months before the election date . 
There is no injunction against establishing it earlier than that . 
) [PER Karzai  ] alleged that the [ORG ECC  ] had tried to “steal the election” and had not performed well in the [ORG Provincial Council  ] audits . 
[PER Eikenberry  ] replied that while the [ORG ECC  ] had not performed perfectly , looking to the future with some high-quality international commissioners ( such as [PER Justice Kriegler  ] ) was very important . 
[LOC KABUL  ] 00000699 003 OF 004 He added that the [ORG IEC  ] had performed poorly , a point [PER Karzai  ] agreed with. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( S ) He then asked [PER Karzai  ] to keep [ORG UNAMA  ] and [ORG ISAF  ] on the candidate vetting commission as observers . 
He pointed out that there are a lot of very bad actors who want political power and that it was always good to have impartial internationals available to be the ones drawing the line against those people . 
[PER Karzai  ] challenged the Ambassador on the grounds that the [ORG USG  ] pays the contracts of some of these “bad actors” to which the Ambassador responded that while that was a fair point , it didn’t mean [PER Karzai  ] shouldn’t keep [ORG UNAMA  ] on the candidate vetting commission. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The Ambassador then pointed out to [PER Karzai  ] that the appointment of independent internationals on these electoral bodies could be helpful to [PER Karzai  ] politically: if [PER Karzai  ] appointed every official involved , he would be the one blamed entirely for an election which will certainly be flawed . 
[PER Eikenberry  ] noted again that this was [MISC Karzai’s  ] legacy and would be judged by future generations , and then asked [PER Karzai  ] if he was really completely positive that [LOC Afghanistan  ] and its institutions are strong enough to not need any foreigners playing any roles . 
[PER Karzai  ] ended the meeting by saying that [PER Ludin  ] had told him he wanted to step down . 
[PER Eikenberry  ] replied that that was good and once more pressed [PER Karzai  ] to ensure the [ORG ECC Commissioners  ] are independent , reminding him that [PER Karzai  ] had separately told [PER SRSG Eide  ] and [PER Eikenberry  ] several weeks prior unambiguously that he would retain two foreigners on the [ORG ECC  ] in accordance with a formula developed by [ORG Eide.  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( S ) Comment: We will continue our engagement over the next several days with key [PER Karzai  ] ministers supportive of pragmatic electoral reform , as well as with interested [MISC Parliamentarians  ] . 
As noted above , Minister [PER Zakhilwal  ] told Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] he would rally like-minded ministers and attempt to reach a favorable outcome by Monday . 
The electoral reform issue provides a good test of the future potential and limits of [PER Karzai  ] as a partner . 
[LOC U.S.  ] interests , the imperatives of Afghan-statebuilding , and [MISC Afghanistan’s  ] long-term developmental interests will occasionally require [PER Karzai  ] to make difficult choices . 
This is such an instance . 
Also to be validated is his coterie of reform-minded ministers’ ability to adroitly manage [PER Karzai  ] behind closed doors as occurred during his decision to accept a second round in last fall’s election . 
A strong , empowered group of such ministers will be crucial to [MISC U.S.-Afghan  ] success in the months ahead. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( U ) [PER Begin  ] non-paper text: [ORG Electoral Reform  ] President [PER Karzai  ] made a firm commitment at the [ORG London Conference  ] to put in place meaningful electoral reforms which reflect lessons learned from 2009 and to ensure measures are in place to tackle the electoral abuses witnessed last year . 
Strengthening the independence of the [ORG Independent Elections Commission  ] ( [ORG IEC  ] ) and the [ORG Electoral Complaints Commission  ] ( [ORG ECC  ] ) is vital to ensuring that these institutions are impartial and effective . 
The following three key measures are essential to ensuring the credibility of the Parliamentary electoral process and the success of the future [LOC Parliament  ] , an institution integral to strengthening [MISC Afghanistan’s  ] democracy . 
They are also measures that will enable the international community to convince their governments to help fund and otherwise support these and future elections . 
-- Replacing the [ORG IEC  ] chair with an independent and qualified official -- Maintaining the integrity of the [ORG ECC  ] through a combination of independent [MISC Afghans  ] and international experts -- Establishing a strong candidate vetting process that involves the participation of both [MISC Afghans  ] and the international community The following key reforms would represent important steps towards constructive electoral reform that draw on the lessons learned in 2009: -- [ORG IEC  ] staff committing or complicit in electoral offenses are dismissed -- [ORG IEC  ] sessions are opened to accredited observers -- [MISC IEC-recommended  ] fraud deterrence plans are implemented -- A comprehensive [ORG Ministry of Interior and IEC-endorsed  ] security plan is established 60-90 days before the election -- Polling stations are announced at least 90 days before elections -- Conditions are in place to maximize the participation of [LOC KABUL  ] 00000699 004 OF 004 women and vulnerable groups in elections , both as candidates and voters -- Domestic observers and political party agents are supported and their participation in election day activities is facilitated .
