End Summary . 
[LOC Iraq  ] ---- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Clearly the focus for [PER MbZ  ] , discussion began with his pronouncement: " Let 's talk about [LOC Iraq  ] . 
" [PER Gen. Abizaid  ] noted that extremists on both ends of the [LOC Sunni/Shia  ] spectrum are largely irretrievable , but we still have an opportunity to stabilize [LOC Iraq  ] by reinforcing the moderate middle ground . 
[PER MbZ  ] said that he had little confidence in being able to work with this ( [PER Maliki  ] 's ) government , saying of [MISC Maliki:  ] " I think we are operating on different frequencies -- no , different radio systems altogether . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER MbZ  ] asked General [PER Abizaid  ] what the [LOC U.S.  ] hoped to achieve with the extra troops set to deploy to [LOC Iraq  ] in 2007 , and reiterated his concern about the level of ongoing violence against the [MISC Sunni  ] . 
[PER Abizaid  ] responded that the violence in [LOC Iraq  ] is highly localized , principally in the [LOC Baghdad  ] area , and that most of the rest of [LOC Iraq  ] is quiet . 
The extra troops are intended to bring calm to [LOC Baghdad  ] and give the government sufficient space and time to contain violence even further . 
It will also send a message that the [LOC U.S.  ] is not abandoning [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[PER MbZ  ] stated that [PER Ahmad Chalabi  ] and others had made a " big deal " out of the Baathist threat , but said that the Baathists were not and are not the problem -- even though specific individuals linked to the [LOC Ba  ] , ath Party were/are the problem . 
[PER MbZ  ] offered that de-Baathification was and is " an unnecessary distraction , " stating that " pursuing a problem that doesn't really exist only leads to more problems . 
" He said he had seen [PER Iyad Allawi  ] a month ago -- noting that [PER Allawi  ] was looking to the [ORG UAE  ] for support and assurances . 
[PER MbZ  ] said that there is no assurance that the [ORG UAE  ] can give him , adding: " It 's not his time . 
" [PER MbZ  ] added that he believes that the [MISC Saudis  ] will not assist [MISC Sunni  ] groups in [LOC Iraq  ] that are aligned with [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] . 
[LOC Iran  ] ---- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER MbZ  ] acknowledged that [LOC Tehran  ] knows that the [LOC U.S.  ] is serious in its stance against [MISC Iranian  ] proliferation . 
This can be clearly seen in " how [LOC Iran  ] is changing its tactics . 
" [PER Abizaid  ] pressed that countries in the region should make stronger statements . 
Weak statements only encourage the [MISC Iranians:  ] " We need our friends to say that they stand with the [MISC Americans  ] . 
" [PER MbZ  ] avoided committing the [LOC UAE  ] to anything like a public statement and shifted the discussion to other countries in the region saying: " The [MISC Saudis  ] need no encouragement -- they are [MISC Wahhabis  ] after all -- and will resolutely stand up to any [ORG Shi'a  ] anywhere and counter them strongly . 
" Agreeing that it is only a matter of time before the [MISC Iranians  ] develop or acquire advanced weapons technologies , including [MISC MTCR-controlled  ] UAV technology , [PER MbZ  ] asserted: " That 's why we need it first . . . give me Predator B . 
" [PER MbZ  ] added: " [LOC Iran  ] has to know that there is a price to pay for every decision they make . 
They are expanding day by day -- they have to be dealt with before they do something tragic . 
" But that said , he continued: " We ( [ORG UAE  ] ) are not ready yet " to confront [LOC Iran  ] . 
Afghanistan/Pakistan -------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Abizaid  ] thanked [PER MbZ  ] for the actions of the [ORG UAE  ] forces currently deployed in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER MbZ  ] reciprocated: " No -- ABU DHABI 00000145 002 OF 002 thank you . 
This has been a good chance for us , and we appreciate the opportunity . 
" [PER MbZ  ] questioned the role the [MISC Iranians  ] were playing in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
He further observed that [PER Musharraf  ] is not doing enough to engage the tribes in the south , and needs to expand its efforts there . 
[LOC Lebanon/Hizballah/Somalia  ] -------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Noting [MISC Lebanese  ] PM [PER Siniora  ] 's January 16 visit to the [LOC UAE  ] , [PER MbZ  ] characterized [PER Siniora  ] as &a good man . 
We are supporting him . 
" [PER MbZ  ] said that [ORG Hizballah  ] has made a " big mistake " in estimating its support in [LOC Lebanon  ] , and has " played it wrong -- they do not have the support of the majority of the [MISC Lebanese  ] people . 
" [PER MbZ  ] discussed with [PER Abizaid  ] the military technology that [ORG Hizballah  ] used in 2006 , specifically noting the amount of anti-tank weapons that [ORG Hizballah  ] possessed . 
[PER Abizaid  ] acknowledged that [ORG Hizballah  ] has access to weapons technology that most [MISC Arab  ] states don't have . 
[PER MbZ  ] interrupted the conversation to state explicitly that he wants the [LOC U.S.  ] to understand that the [ORG UAE  ] was not involved in the transfer of those weapons or technologies in any way . 
Referring to the recent events in [LOC Somalia  ] , [PER MbZ  ] commented: " The [LOC Somalia  ] job was fantastic . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 .
