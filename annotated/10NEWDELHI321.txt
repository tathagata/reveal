<code><pre>Monday , 22 February 2010 , 08:52 [ORG C O N  ] F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 [LOC NEW DELHI  ] 000321 SENSITIVE SIPDIS DEPARTMENT FOR SCA/INS , DRL EO 12958 DECL: 02/22/2020 TAGS PGOV , PHUM , PINR , PTER , IN , EAGR SUBJECT: [LOC DELHI  ] DIARY , JANUARY 30 - FEBRUARY 19 , 2010 [ORG Classified By: Political Counselor Uzra Zeya for Reasons  ] 1.4 ( B , D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) Below is a compilation of political highlights from [ORG Embassy New Delhi  ] for January 30 - February 19 , 2010 , that did not feature in our other reporting . 
My Name Is [PER Rahul  ] ---- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( SBU ) [PER Rahul  ] Gandhi’s [LOC Mumbai  ] visit and his skirmishing with the [ORG Maharashtra  ] chauvinist [ORG Shiv Sena  ] party shows he is becoming increasingly sure-footed in his political instincts . 
He first hurled some blunt words at the Thackerays and [ORG Shiv Sena’s  ] xenophobic agenda . 
These were widely and sympathetically reported around the country . 
He then took it a step further when the [ORG Shiv Sena  ] issued “Keep Off Maharashtra” threats by going to the [MISC Thackeray’s  ] home ground of [LOC Mumbai  ] , where he continued to take shots at them . 
He topped it off by showing the common touch when he made a last minute change in his itinerary to travel across town in a second-class train compartment . 
All in all , a public relations bonanza for [PER Rahul  ] as the press gave wide coverage to his Siv [ORG Sena  ] bashing and his train ride . 
Forty [ORG Shiv Sena  ] activists were detained by the police for [MISC Rahul’s  ] visit . 
[PER Don’t  ] Talk About My Mother ---- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Not to be outdone , the [ORG Shiv Sena  ] has been grabbing headlines in recent days with its attacks on [PER Rahul Gandhi  ] , [ORG Reliance Group’s  ] [PER Mukesh Ambani  ] and [MISC Bollywood  ] icon , [PER Shah Rukh Khan  ] . 
The [ORG Shiv Sena  ] has also been in a tussle with the [ORG Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh  ] ( [ORG RSS  ] ) , which is the parent organization of its ally , the [ORG Bharatiya Janata Party’s  ] ( [ORG BJP  ] ) , over the rights of [MISC North Indian  ] migrants in [LOC Mumbai  ] . 
Media reports a rift between the [ORG RSS  ] and the [ORG Shiv Sena  ] over the [ORG Sena’s  ] verbal attacks on migrants from [LOC Bihar  ] and [LOC Uttar Pradesh  ] . 
[PER Rahul Gandhi  ] came to the defense of [MISC North Indians  ] living and working in [LOC Mumbai  ] during an ongoing visit to [LOC Bihar  ] by telling press that the [ORG Sena  ] was irrelevant and that all [MISC Indians  ] had a right to reside freely in [LOC India  ] . 
[ORG Shiv Sena  ] supremo [PER Bal Thackeray  ] responded by launching an attack on [PER Rahul  ] Gandhi’s “Italian Mummy , ” referring to [MISC Italian-born  ] UPA chief [PER Sonia Gandhi  ] . 
The [MISC Tiger Roars  ] Again ? ---- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) [PER Raj Thackeray-led  ] vitriolic splinter group , the [ORG MNS  ] , has cut into the [ORG Shiv Sena’s  ] support base in recent years . 
The [ORG MNS  ] usurped the [ORG Shiv Sena’s  ] xenophobic platform to exclude non-Maharashtrians from power and influence in [LOC Maharashtra  ] . 
Finding themselves increasingly marginalized and losing support from their anti-migrant Marathi-speaking base , the [ORG Shiv Sena  ] has gone on a publicity and campaign blitz to position itself as the undisputed champion of ethnic [MISC Marathi  ] speakers . 
The [MISC Bollywood Show Must Go  ] On ---- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) The [ORG Shiv Sena  ] had threatened to ban screenings of [PER Shah Rukh Khan’s  ] upcoming movie , “My Name is [MISC Khan”  ] , because [PER Shah Rukh Khan  ] publicly lamented the absence of [MISC Pakistani  ] cricket players in India’s professional cricket league for the coming season . 
[ORG Shiv Sena  ] goons burnt posters of [MISC Khan’s  ] upcoming movie and protested in front of his home , asking [PER Khan  ] to “move to [MISC Pakistan.”  ] [PER Khan  ] himself did not bid on any [MISC Pakistani  ] players as co-owner of one of the frachises . 
While some theater owners refrained from screening the film on its Friday opening due to security concerns , a show of force by the police convinced theaters to roll out a full release on Saturday . 
With protests and controversy generating far more international buzz than the typical [MISC Bollywood  ] movie , [MISC Khan’s  ] new movie opened to packed audiences in [LOC Mumbai  ] and elsewhere . 
[LOC NEW DELHI  ] 00000321 002 OF 003 New [ORG Indian Youth Congress  ] President Appointed ---- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) On February 3 , the [ORG Congress Party  ] appointed [PER Rajiv Satav  ] the President of its youth wing , the [ORG Indian Youth Congress  ] ( [ORG IYC  ] ) . 
[ORG Party General  ] Secretary [PER Rahul Gandhi  ] hand-picked [PER Satav  ] for the job , surprising political observers who had expected an election for the top [ORG IYC  ] post per Gandhi’s previous statements about making the party “more democratic.” Contacts speculate that the appointment of [PER Satav  ] -- a native of the state of [LOC Maharashtra  ] -- is intended to enhance the [ORG Congress  ] Party’s position in the state . 
A [ORG Congress  ] Party-Nationalist [ORG Congress Party  ] ( [ORG NCP  ] ) coalition governs [LOC Maharashtra  ] , but the coalition partners have been feuding over rising food prices . 
( Note: The [ORG Congress Party  ] has repeatedly tried to shift the blame for rising prices on to [ORG NCP  ] chief [PER Sharad Pawar  ] , who is also the Agriculture and Food Supplies Minister in the [ORG Congress  ] Party’s [ORG United Progressive Alliance  ] government in [LOC Delhi  ] . 
End Note . 
) Gandhi’s [ORG IYC  ] pick may signal that [LOC Maharashtra  ] is the next data point along the [ORG Congress  ] Party’s trend of going it alone in some large states where it had previously been reduced to a junior partner or a non-entity. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) [PER Rajiv Satav  ] , 35 , is the son of former [ORG Maharashtra  ] Minister [PER Rajnitai Satav  ] . 
[PER Satav  ] was elected to the [LOC Maharashtra  ] legislative assembly for the first time in 2009 , following his big political break when he was nominated as the [ORG Maharashtra Youth Congress  ] chief in 2008 . 
[PER Satav  ] has accompanied [PER Rahul Gandhi  ] on several high profile visits , including his recent tour of [LOC Bihar  ] and his train ride in [LOC Mumbai  ] . 
As the [ORG Youth Congress  ] chief , [PER Satav  ] will face the challenge of increasing youth participation in the political process , while countering the influence of the [PER Raj Thackeray-led  ] [ORG MNS  ] in [LOC Maharashtra  ] , whose aggressive and street-smart style has attracted [MISC Indian  ] youth . 
[MISC Valentine’s Day  ] Vignettes: Rainbows and [ORG Pink Hearts  ] ---- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) February 14 marked the first time some couples were able to paint the town pink in [LOC India  ] . 
On July 2 , the [ORG Delhi High Court  ] overturned some provisions of [MISC Section 377 of the  ] [ORG Indian Penal Code  ] , a colonial-era law that outlawed same gender sex between two consenting adults . 
The [ORG GOI  ] allowed the historic ruling to stand after deciding not to appeal it . 
Over six months later , [ORG Archie’s  ] , India’s largest greeting card company , gave the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( [ORG LGBT  ] ) community another cause for celebration by selling cards targeted for the community in 500 stores across [LOC New Delhi  ] and major [MISC Indian  ] cities to celebrate [MISC Valentine’s Day  ] . 
[ORG Archie’s  ] spokesman [PER Yohan Arya  ] told the [ORG Times of India  ] that the company had been considering making available several [ORG LGBT  ] cards for some time . 
They decided the time was right after the July 2 high court judgment. “The court judgment ...clearly said that it’s legal to be gay... so we felt this was the right time to add these cards , ” [PER Arya  ] added . 
( It is not yet known how well these new cards sold . 
) [LOC New Delhi  ] also embraced the [ORG LGBT  ] community by focusing on them as customers for [MISC Valentine’s Day  ] celebrations . 
Clubs and lounges were buzzing with theme parties and special cocktails , with some bars openly encouraging [ORG LGBT  ] couples - the first time this has happened in [LOC New Delhi  ] . 
A Peaceful [PER Valentine  ] ---- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) The [MISC Sri Ram  ] [ORG Sena  ] ( [ORG SRS  ] ) , a small , fringe [MISC Hindu  ] extremist group which has in the past engaged in isolated violence against young men and women celebrating [MISC Valentine’s Day  ] , lost its momentum this year . 
The leader of the [ORG SRS  ] , [PER Pramod Muthalik  ] , claims that he is fighting for [LOC India  ] , the youth , and [MISC Indian  ] culture . 
[MISC Valentine’s Day  ] , he alleges “is [LOC NEW DELHI  ] 00000321 003 OF 003 aimed at ruining ( [MISC Indian  ] ) culture.” This year , his message was lost , as the [MISC Sri Ram  ] [ORG Sena  ] joined ranks with the [ORG Shiv Sena  ] and spent the days leading up to February 14 fighting the release of [PER Shah Rukh Khan’s  ] latest Bollywoodblockbuster . 
The [ORG SRS  ] faced additional humiliation on February 11 when an individual “attacked” [PER Muthalik  ] . 
While [PER Muthalik  ] was preparing to participate in a debate on [MISC Valentine’s Day  ] in an open air theater , six young men barged in , dragged him off stage , and blackened his face with ink . 
The shocked [PER Muthalik  ] fell down during the melee before he could be rescued by his supporters . 
The police arrested two of the perpetrators and brought three more youths in for questioning . 
With its leader brought down a peg , the [ORG SRS  ] was not heard from during this year’s [MISC Valentine’s Day  ] celebrations . 
Update on [MISC Tibetan Refugee Flow  ] ---- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [PER PolOff  ] on February 4 that an average of 2,500 to 3,500 refugees from [LOC Tibet  ] typically arrive in [LOC Dharamsala  ] each year , with most returning to [LOC Tibet  ] after receiving an audience with the [PER Dalai Lama  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] confirmed that from 1980 to November 2009 87,096 refugees were processed by the [ORG Dharamsala Reception Center  ] ( [ORG RC  ] ) and that 46,620 returned to [LOC Tibet  ] after a short pilgrimage in [LOC India  ] . 
Most of those who do stay in [LOC India  ] are children who then attend schools run by [MISC Tibetan Children’s Villages  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] both highlighted to [PER PolOff  ] that , following the March 2008 uprising in [LOC Tibet  ] , the number of [MISC Tibetan  ] refugees markedly decreased , with only about 650 refugees arriving at the [ORG RC  ] from April 2008 to March 2009 . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] speculated that [LOC Beijing  ] has asked [LOC Kathmandu  ] to step up patrols of [MISC Nepali  ] border forces and make it more difficult for [MISC Tibetans  ] to enter [LOC Nepal  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] reiterated this belief to [PER PolOff  ] during a [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] meeting in [LOC Delhi  ] , stating “the [MISC Chinese  ] government rewards ( [MISC Nepali  ] forces ) ” by providing financial incentives to officers who hand over [MISC Tibetans  ] attempting to exit [LOC China  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was optimistic that flow of refugees will soon go back to normal levels because admission statistics for 2010 are surpassing those from an equivalent period in 2009 .
