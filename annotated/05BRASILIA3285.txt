Reasons:1.4 ( B ) ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG PolCouns  ] spoke with senior [MISC Brazilian  ] Government ( [ORG GOB  ] ) contacts in the foreign ministry ( [ORG MRE  ] ) and Presidency on 15 December to check on the [ORG GOB  ] 's preparations for the 18 December election in [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
They noted the following: <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Marcel Biato  ] , deputy foreign affairs advisor to President [PER Lula da Silva  ] , told [ORG PolCouns  ] that [PER Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] , [PER Lula  ] 's senior international advisor and designated [LOC Bolivia  ] envoy , will travel on Saturday to [LOC Bolivia  ] and link up with [PER Carlos  ] " [MISC Chaco  ] " [PER Alvarez  ] , a former vice president of [LOC Argentina  ] and [ORG Mercosul  ] 's senior political representative . 
[PER Biato  ] said [PER Garcia  ] and [PER Alvarez  ] , along with their advisors , will not act as observers per se , but rather will be in [LOC Bolivia  ] as a " high-level presence " to show regional support for the democratic process . 
They plan to meet with the three presidential candidates and other key leaders , [PER Biato  ] said. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG MRE  ] 's Acting [MISC Andean  ] division chief , [PER Lauro Beltrao  ] , told [ORG PolCouns  ] that [ORG Mercosul  ] has also organized a regular election observer mission of working level personnel , including [MISC Brazilian  ] officials , who should begin arriving in [LOC Bolivia  ] on 16 December . 
He added the [ORG Mercosul  ] mission was in part a response to the November " open letter " from the [MISC Bolivian  ] Government seeking observers , and the details of the [ORG Mercosul  ] mission had been finalized by [PER FM Amorim  ] in conversations with [LOC Bolivia  ] 's foreign minister. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Comment . 
[PER Biato  ] and [PER Beltrao  ] both affirmed the [ORG GOB  ] 's paramount concern that the election process needs to be seen among [MISC Bolivians  ] as transparent and legitimate . 
They said the [ORG GOB  ] , like other observers , anticipates a best-case scenario in which there is a " gentleman 's agreement " wherein the second-place candidate will defer to the front-runner if the margin of victory is clear . 
A more troubling scenario , in the [ORG GOB  ] 's view , would be a murky electoral result that leads to the president-elect being designated by the legislature , exacerbating the polarization among the populace . 
In an earlier meeting on 8 December during the [LOC Brasilia  ] visit of [ORG WHA Special Advisor for Counter Terrorism and Border Security McCarthy  ] , [ORG PolCouns  ] ask [PER Antonio Macedo Soares  ] , a senior analyst in the Presidency 's [ORG Institutional Security Cabinet  ] ( [ORG GSI  ] ) , whether the [ORG GSI  ] is planning for possible second-order effects if the [LOC Bolivia  ] political situation deteriorates into instability or radicalization that threatens [MISC Brazilian  ] interests , especially [ORG Petrobras  ] and energy resources from [LOC Bolivia  ] that are critical to industry in southern [LOC Brazil  ] . 
( [ORG Note:  ] The [ORG GSI  ] is a combination crisis management and national security and intelligence coordination entity within the [MISC Brazilian  ] presidency . 
End note . 
) [PER Macedo Soares  ] acknowledged that the [ORG GSI  ] has been assessing likely impacts from energy shortfalls , but would not be drawn into a detailed discussion . 
Rather , he admitted candidly that the [ORG GOB  ] is essentially banking on " a strategy of hope , " i.e. , that despite fiery nationalist rhetoric during the elections , sensible leaders in [LOC Bolivia  ] will not allow radical new government policies or general instability to damage [MISC Brazilian  ] energy industries which contribute so massively to [LOC Bolivia  ] 's economy . 
Per remarks of [LOC Brazil  ] 's Ambassador in [LOC La Paz  ] noted in reftel , [PER Macedo Soares  ] also expressed deep concern within [LOC Brazil  ] 's police and intelligence communities about the potential for increased cocaine flows into [LOC Brazil  ] from [LOC Bolivia  ] in the event of a [PER Morales  ] victory .
