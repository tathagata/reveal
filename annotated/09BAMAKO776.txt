THANKS FOR SUPPORT WITH HARD LANDING <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) On November 27 the Ambassador and [ORG U.S. Africa Command  ] General [PER William E  ] . 
( " [MISC Kip  ] " ) [PER Ward  ] met with [MISC Malian  ] President [PER Amadou Toumani Toure  ] ( [ORG ATT  ] ) . 
The Ambassador and General [PER Ward  ] were accompanied by [ORG Foreign Policy Advisor Dr. Raymond L. Brown  ] and [ORG AFRICOM Public Affairs  ] Director Colonel [PER Frank Childress  ] . 
[ORG ATT  ] was accompanied by Minister of [ORG Defense Natie Pleah  ] , Secretary General to the [PER PresidencyDiango Cissoko  ] , and Chief of [ORG Defense Poudiougou  ] . 
General [PER Ward  ] thanked the President for [LOC Mali  ] 's support in the recent hard landing of a plane carrying [LOC U.S.  ] military personnel approximately 65 miles outside of [LOC Bamako  ] . 
[ORG ATT  ] reiterated ref A comments that it was only natural [LOC Mali  ] should help , since after all he knew the [LOC United States  ] was coming to help [LOC Mali  ] . 
PROGRESS AND CONCERNS IN NORTHERN [LOC MALI  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) [ORG ATT  ] said that since General [PER Ward  ] 's last visit ( ref B ) the [MISC Tuareg  ] rebellion had been brought to an end . 
Even the head of the most recent rebellion has sent a message of peace , and ten or so of the former rebels , " since they like to fight so much " are being sent off to support the [ORG African Union Mission  ] in [LOC Somalia  ] ( see [ORG IIR  ] 6 958 0021 10 ) . 
[ORG ATT  ] said he had concerns about the [LOC Salafists  ] , another term for [PER Al Q'Aida  ] in the Lands of the [LOC Islamic Maghreb  ] ( [ORG AQIM  ] ) . 
While the [LOC Salafists  ] have had difficulty getting their message across to a generally reluctant population , they have had some success in enlisting disaffected youth to their ranks . 
He said the [MISC Malian  ] Army is at a turning point , with the older generation in the military giving way to a younger , less experienced one . 
In this regard , he thanked General [PER Ward  ] for the training the [LOC United States  ] is providing to the recently created Echelons [PER Tactiques Inter-Arme  ] ( ETIAs ) . 
NEED FOR MORE REGIONAL COOPERATION <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) [ORG ATT  ] lamented that regional cooperation appears to be stalled . 
[MISC Mauritanian  ] President [PER Aziz  ] is a soldier who understands the situation . 
He has put the recent political troubles behind him and is working well with [LOC Mali  ] . 
[LOC Niger  ] has always been a good partner . 
Although the country has its own [MISC Tuareg  ] rebellion problem and is focused on a domestic political crisis , [LOC Niger  ] continues to work well together with [LOC Mali  ] . 
Military cooperation with [LOC Algeria  ] is the problem . 
[ORG ATT  ] said the [MISC Algerians  ] think we do not do anything , and they are not totally wrong , but we need [LOC Algeria  ] 's help in terms of air support . 
It is not just a matter of destroying a couple of [ORG AQIM  ] bases , we have to be able to hold the territory . 
The longer the situation drags on , the stronger the [LOC Salafists  ] will get. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) [ORG ATT  ] directly linked revenues from drug trafficking to terrorism . 
He said the [ORG Boeing  ] 727 which had been set fire near [LOC Tarkint  ] , in [LOC Northern Mali  ] after it got stuck in the sand on or about October 30 may have been carrying drugs . 
[LOC Mali  ] is cooperating with friendly countries to try to gain information about the nature of the flight and has lodged complaints about the violation of its air space with [ORG Interpol  ] and with the [ORG UN Office of Drugs and Crime  ] . 
[ORG ATT  ] said security will be easier to achieve with three or four countries [ORG BAMAKO  ] 00000776 002 OF 003 working together rather than alone . 
If the other countries cannot agree , then of course we have to do it ourselves , he said . 
[LOC UNITED STATES  ] COMMITTED TO HELP <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) General [PER Ward  ] thanked the President for catching him up on the situation . 
He said he is happy to hear of the President 's continued commitment to fighting terrorism . 
If the government of [LOC Mali  ] is unable to gain better control over under-governed territory , it will continue to give free reign to arms and drug traffickers and terrorists , frustrating legitimate development efforts . 
General [PER Ward  ] said that , with Ambassador [PER Milovanovic  ] , we are paying close attention to how we can increase the capacity of the [MISC Malian  ] Army to eliminate the threat posed . 
The [LOC United States  ] is looking to ensure a continuum of training and maintenance capacity building . 
Keeping trained units together and using the equipment provided in a sustainable manner will help [LOC Mali  ] achieve its goals. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) General [PER Ward  ] said he shares [ORG ATT  ] 's analysis that the bad guys do not respect borders and that [LOC Mali  ] needs regional cooperation . 
Having just come from [LOC Algeria  ] , General [PER Ward  ] said he had made the same point to [MISC Algerian  ] President [PER Abdelaziz Bouteflika  ] , as well as to the [MISC Algerian  ] Ministers of [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] and [ORG Defense  ] , and to the Chief of [MISC Defense:  ] all agreed to the need for regional cooperation . 
General [PER Ward  ] said he would be looking for signs of increased cooperation on the ground. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) The [ORG USG  ] supports the implementation and follow-on to the meeting of [ORG Chiefs of Defense  ] in [LOC Tamanrassett  ] , [LOC Algeria  ] as well as the heads of state meeting in [LOC Bamako  ] . 
General [PER Ward  ] said he hopes the joint operations center discussed in [LOC Tamanrassett  ] will become a reality soon , and will be able to support operations in the [LOC North  ] of [LOC Mali  ] . 
Once the operations center becomes a reality , the [ORG USG  ] stands ready to assist with training and equipment if asked , as well as providing transparent updates on [LOC U.S.  ] security engagement with regional partners . 
General [PER Ward  ] said he was very impressed by [ORG ATT  ] 's statement that , whether or not the neighbors get involved in a constructive manner , he would be taking responsibility for security in the [LOC North  ] . 
" When that step is taken , no one will be able to say you have not done anything . 
" MOVING FORWARD TOGETHER <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) The President said he shares General [PER Ward  ] 's views . 
He noted the frank and excellent working relationship he has with Ambassador [PER Milovanovic  ] , noting wryly that he is sometimes embarrassed by , but always appreciates , her directness . 
Returning to security questions , he described his childhood memory of " the dance of death " from the village in which he grew up: If you dance too far ahead , you die ; if you dance too far behind , you die ; if you do not dance at all , you die . 
That is the way it is in the fight against the [LOC Salafists  ] , he said . 
We have no choice but to move ahead together. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) Chief of [ORG Defense General  ] [PER Gabriel Poudiougou  ] mentioned that the [MISC Algerian  ] Special Forces Commander had just left [ORG Bamako November  ] 26 after a two day visit in which he worked with his [MISC Malian  ] counterparts to establish a transmission network and a better cooperative working arrangement on the ground . 
Colonel [PER Amadou Gueye  ] , in charge of military cooperation at the [ORG MOD  ] , said that a mixed committee for joint military cooperation has been set up , and the fourth meeting is scheduled for December 15 in [LOC Tessalit  ] , [LOC Mali  ] . 
It is to be attended by an [MISC Algerian  ] General . 
[ORG ATT  ] said he is planning a trip to [LOC Algiers  ] to ask [PER Bouteflika  ] for air support , shortly after the [LOC Tessalit  ] meeting . 
[ORG ATT  ] THOUGHTS ON [LOC ALGERIA  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S ) [ORG ATT  ] then asked the Ambassador and General [PER Ward  ] if he could speak to them privately . 
In that meeting , he mentioned that he had gone to see [MISC Libyan  ] leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] and , contrary to the view of some , he is the most interested of all in a head of state summit in [LOC Bamako  ] . 
[ORG ATT  ] said that , after Tabaski ( November 28 ) , he will be going to see President [PER Bouteflika  ] and sending [MISC Malian  ] Foreign Minister [ORG BAMAKO  ] 00000776 003 OF 003 [PER Moctar Ouane  ] to the other countries to find a date for the summit. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( S ) [ORG ATT  ] said he believes [PER Bouteflika  ] and the [MISC Algerian  ] leadership genuinely want to cooperate , although they have real doubts about [LOC Mali  ] 's resolve . 
His visit is intended inter alia to dispel these doubts . 
[ORG ATT  ] said he thinks [LOC Algeria  ] 's intelligence services and army are holding up cooperation , and believes the [MISC Algerian  ] army is infiltrated with [LOC Salafists  ] . 
He is nevertheless pleased with the improved cooperation with [LOC Algeria  ] , and said a lot is riding on concrete outcomes of the December 15 meeting in [LOC Tessalit  ] . 
He wants the heads of state summit to take place first , and then to be prepared to start operations within a week or so . 
This implies that the cooperation already has to be working , in advance of the summit . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( S ) General [PER Ward  ] said the [LOC United States  ] will continue to support [LOC Mali  ] 's efforts with training and equipment . 
He pledged to follow up with the [MISC Algerians  ] , telling them how important the next delegation meeting is , and conveying [ORG ATT  ] 's commitment. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( U ) General [PER Ward  ] cleared this message .
