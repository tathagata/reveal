( C ) This is an action request . 
Please see paragraph 4. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On May 17 , [PER Javier Hergueta  ] , the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] 's deputy director general for bilateral economic relations with [LOC Europe  ] and the [ORG OECD  ] countries , requested a meeting with poloff . 
[PER Hergueta  ] explained that a [MISC Spanish  ] firm , [PER Espindesa  ] ( part of the [ORG Tecnicas Unidas  ] conglomerate ) , had asked the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] to act as an " informal and discreet " interlocutor between the company and the [LOC US  ] government . 
[PER Espindesa  ] , according to [PER Hergueta  ] , had signed a contract with the [MISC Libyan  ] government in 1999 to build a USD 8.5 million factory to make nitric acid in [LOC Libya  ] . 
After September 11 and before work on the factory began in earnest , the [MISC Spanish  ] government halted the project and it has been frozen ever since. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Espindesa  ] asked the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] to approach the [LOC US  ] government on its behalf because the [MISC Libyan  ] government ( the " General [ORG Secretariat of Procurement  ] " ) has recently asked [PER Espindesa  ] to move forward with the factory project . 
[PER Hergueta  ] said that [PER Espindesa  ] does not want to trigger [LOC US  ] sanctions or otherwise draw the US' ire by continuing with the project , and requested that [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] attempt to find out what the [LOC US  ] reaction to the project would be . 
[PER Hergueta  ] told us he asked for the meeting with poloff , rather than sending a diplomatic note or other formal communication , to make the inquiry as discreetly as possible. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Action request: Embassy seeks Department 's guidance on how to respond to the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] 's inquiry .
