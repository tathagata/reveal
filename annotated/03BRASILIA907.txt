( U ) Econoff met on March 12 with [PER Felipe Hees  ] of the Services , Investment and [ORG Financial Issues Division  ] of [ORG Itamaraty  ] to discuss prospects for [LOC Brazil  ] 's submission of services offers in the [ORG WTO  ] ( reftel ) and [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations . 
[ORG WTO  ] - Submission by Deadline Is Doubtful <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Although [PER Hees  ] stressed that a final decision has not been made , he confirmed reports that [LOC Brazil  ] may not submit a [ORG WTO  ] services offer by March 31 . 
The hold-up would not be technical . 
Echoing comments made by [MISC Brazilian  ] negotiators in [LOC Geneva  ] , [PER Hees  ] explained that the [ORG GOB  ] is considering the tactical pros and cons of withholding its services offer to protest what it views as a lack of progress in areas of vital interest for [LOC Brazil  ] . 
The most important of these areas is agriculture , and the [ORG GOB  ] sees little prospect that modalities for the agriculture negotiations will be agreed to by the March 31 deadline . 
[PER Hees  ] laid blame for the difficulties in the agriculture negotiations squarely on the [ORG European Union  ] ( [ORG EU  ] ) . 
Econoff noted [ORG USG  ] concerns that momentum for the [ORG Doha Development Agenda  ] ( [ORG DDA  ] ) may unravel if a mounting number of benchmarks are missed , but [PER Hees  ] responded that without movement by the [ORG EU  ] in agriculture , the [ORG DDA  ] is dead anyway . 
In discussions with Ambassador on March 17 , Foreign Minister [PER Amorim  ] suggested that if [LOC Brazil  ] does submit a services offer by March 31 , it will be modest. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) While [LOC Brazil  ] 's principal focus is agriculture , [PER Hees  ] claimed that missed deadlines in other sensitive areas ( TRIPS and Public Health , Special and [ORG Differential Treatment  ] ) , and low expectations for results on rules ( antidumping , etc . 
) all make it extremely difficult for the [ORG GOB  ] to domestically defend moving forward in negotiating areas where its posture is more " defensive . 
" He restated the [ORG GOB  ] position that all areas of the [ORG DDA  ] must progress together , rejecting as improbable that a satisfactory agreement would result if evaluation of the negotiations as a single-undertaking only transpires at the end of the process . 
[ORG FTAA  ] - Services Lever <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG GOB  ] has already decided to use its services offer within the [ORG FTAA  ] as a tactical lever . 
According to [PER Hees  ] , the [ORG GOB  ] had prepared its offer for the February 15 deadline , but it was withheld at the last minute by order of Foreign Minister [PER Amorim  ] , with the acquiescence of President [PER Lula  ] . 
While claiming that he is not privy to Minister [PER Amorim  ] 's reasoning , [PER Hees  ] said he understood from conversations within the Ministry that the decision was a reaction to disappointment with other aspects of the [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations . 
In particular , he noted the [ORG GOB  ] 's very negative reaction to [LOC Canada  ] 's market access offers for goods , because it excluded 97 agricultural products , including many key [MISC Brazilian  ] exports . 
[ORG GOB  ] Demands Respect <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Leaving aside [LOC Brazil  ] 's decision to delay submission of its offer , [PER Hees  ] used the opportunity to express frustration with the [LOC U.S.  ] approach in [ORG FTAA  ] services negotiations . 
His core accusation was that discussions between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Mercosul  ] delegations are less than frank , within plenary as well as within bilateral meetings . 
He was particularly vexed by what he portrayed as a lack of forthrightness in the way the initial [LOC U.S.  ] services offer was characterized in [LOC Panama  ] . 
According to [PER Hees  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation described the [LOC U.S.  ] offer in plenary as covering " all levels of the [ORG USG  ] , " but that after reading the text , the [MISC Mercosul  ] delegation concluded that it does not . 
To illustrate , [PER Hees  ] cited an exception given in [ORG Annex  ] 1 ( p.17 ) that allowed all sub-federal levels of government to enact legislation that did not accord national treatment . 
By his read , this means that any state within the [LOC United States  ] would be able to enact legislation that discriminates against [MISC Brazilian  ] service providers , without violating [ORG USG  ] commitments . 
[PER Hees  ] said the [ORG GOB  ] recognizes that the [LOC U.S.  ] government structure poses challenges for devising services commitments ; he suggested that the [ORG GOB  ] would display more understanding regarding this difficulty , if the exchanges between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Mercosul  ] delegations would be more candid . 
He also claimed that information provided on [LOC U.S.  ] willingness to negotiate Mode 4 concessions was misleading . 
[PER Hees  ] stressed that more candid exchanges between the delegations could reduce friction and help move the negotiations forward through productive dialog. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) [PER Hees  ] also termed the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" mantra " that offers be constructed as " negative " lists as a source of friction . 
[PER Hees  ] claimed that the [ORG GOB  ] has not yet rejected the possibility of using a negative list . 
However , he asserted that the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation 's insistence that the negative list approach be adopted , without the benefit of a substantive discussion of the pros and cons of other approaches , forces [LOC Brazil  ] to react defensively , taking a similarly rigid stance in favor of a positive list . 
More or less , [PER Hees  ] said that [LOC Brazil  ] has to be convinced ) not told -- that a negative list approach is better . 
He noted that [LOC Peru  ] and [LOC Colombia  ] had constructed their offers in yet different ways and thought these approaches might also have something to offer to the debate. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) [PER Hees  ] argued that the premise that a negative list provides for more comprehensive commitments is basically flawed , noting that some negative list offers submitted by [ORG FTAA  ] countries were far from comprehensive ) the devil being in the details of the annexes ) including for future services . 
Countries intent on liberalizing can do so under either approach , just as countries can also opt for keeping their markets closed , he opined . 
Furthermore , he claimed that a negative list , at least according to the [LOC U.S.  ] offer , provides less , not more , specificity regarding restrictions . 
He noted an annex entry covering " all sectors , " which identified applicable [LOC U.S.  ] laws , but without indicating how the laws would affect provision of the services in the sector ; there was no mention of the specific subsectors or modes affected . 
Expanding on this , [PER Hees  ] argued that there is also real value to sticking to a system ( [ORG GATS  ] ) that government officials throughout the hemisphere now know how to read and use , pointing out that they will have to be able to explain to their exporters in detail what services openings and restrictions they will face. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) In a final note , [PER Hees  ] asked that due respect be given to [LOC Brazil  ] considering the extent to which services have already been liberalized in the country . 
[PER Hees  ] complained that the [LOC U.S.  ] appears to approach [LOC Brazil  ] much in the same way as it approaches countries with closed services sectors , he presumes because constitutional difficulties prevented ratification of [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG GATS  ] commitments . 
He suggested that acknowledgment of [LOC Brazil  ] 's current openness would create a more positive environment for [LOC Brazil  ] to consider requests for improving access .
