LEBANON: A " MODEL " FOR THE REGION ----------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Caretaker Prime Minister [PER Fouad Siniora  ] welcomed the one-day visit of the Commanding General of [ORG U.S. Central Command  ] ( [ORG CENTCOM  ] ) General [PER David Petraeus  ] to [LOC Beirut  ] on June <a id='par30' href='#par30'>¶</a>30 . 
[PER Siniora  ] expressed his thanks for sustained [LOC U.S.  ] military assistance to [LOC Lebanon  ] and asserted that [LOC U.S.  ] security assistance had contributed to the positive outcome of the June 7 [MISC Lebanese  ] parliamentary elections . 
[PER Siniora  ] said he was " quite satisfied " that the majority March 14 coalition had shown that its majority was decisive and not " fictitious , " as it had been described by others after the previous elections in 2005 . 
He described the electoral outcome as vote for the state and its institutions . 
[PER Siniora  ] said that although [LOC Lebanon  ] was not the most important country in the world and despite minor irregularities in the conduct of the elections , [LOC Lebanon  ] had shown that it could be a model of diversity and democracy -- without outside interference -- in the region. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) General [PER Petraeus  ] congratulated [PER Siniora  ] on winning his own electoral campaign and the [MISC Lebanese  ] people for conducting peaceful elections . 
In addition , he expressed hope that the new cabinet would be formed soon . 
[PER Siniora  ] predicted the government formation would likely " take some time " because of debate about " blocking third " veto power for the opposition . 
[ORG MIDDLE EAST  ] PEACE: NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF [LOC LEBANON  ] ------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Siniora  ] said that [LOC Lebanon  ] was encouraged by and supportive of President [PER Obama  ] 's commitment to achieving a comprehensive [LOC Middle East Peace  ] . 
He said the [LOC U.S.  ] administration 's recognition of the centrality of the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] conflict was an opportunity to push the [LOC Arab Peace Initiative  ] forward and to finally achieve a resolution . 
The [MISC Israelis  ] , however , were being uncooperative , he accused . 
In his June 14 speech , [MISC Israeli  ] PM [PER Benjamin Netanyahu  ] had said " yes " to a two-state solution with but added " a thousand no 's , " [PER Siniora  ] analyzed . 
The ultimate fate of [MISC Palestinian  ] refugees , could not come at the expense of [LOC Lebanon  ] , [PER Siniora  ] cautioned . 
( Note: [LOC Lebanon  ] has 12 [MISC Palestinian  ] rfugee camps . 
The [ORG GOL  ] maintains that the [MISC Palestinins  ] should have the " right of return " and is agaist permanent resettlement ( " tawteen " ) in [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
End note . 
) [LOC SYRIA  ] ----- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [LOC Syria  ] , [PER Siniora  ] said , has geopolitical significance . 
He said [LOC Lebanon  ] desired a mutually respectful relationship with [LOC Syria  ] and lauded the establishment of diplomatic relations between [LOC Lebanon  ] and [LOC Syria  ] as a good first step . 
However , other issues , such as border delineation and the presence of [ORG PFLP-GC  ] military camps , supported by [LOC Syria  ] , on the border , remain . 
[PER Siniora  ] commented on the signs of increased [LOC U.S.  ] engagement with [LOC Syria  ] , but he advised the [LOC United States  ] to be careful not to give any rewards to [LOC Syria  ] without [LOC Syria  ] taking action first . 
Most importantly , the [LOC U.S.  ] should not allow [LOC Syria  ] -- or other states in the region -- to use [LOC Lebanon  ] as a platform or battleground ; engagement with [LOC Syria  ] should not come at the expense of [LOC Lebanon  ] , [PER Siniora  ] said. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) General [PER Petraeus  ] assured [PER Siniora  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] administration understood [LOC Lebanon  ] 's concerns . 
He told [PER Siniora  ] that [MISC Syrian  ] President [PER Bashar Asad  ] had invited him to visit several times , but the time was not yet appropriate . 
[LOC Syria  ] , he added , continues to allow [PER Al Qaeda-affiliated  ] facilitation networks to operate from its territory and allow the transit of suicide bombers into [LOC Iraq  ] . 
General [PER Petraeus  ] added that the [LOC U.S.  ] would like to see [LOC Syria  ] return to the [MISC Arab  ] world and develop closer ties to the western world , rather than continue to align itself with [LOC Iran  ] . 
[LOC IRAN  ] ---- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) On [LOC Iran  ] , General [PER Petraeus  ] said that the crisis following [LOC Iran  ] 's June 12 presidential election had revealed significant cracks in the [MISC Iranian  ] system . 
He said the announced outcome of the election and subsequent demonstrations showed that the " urban street " and the " young street " were not supportive of [MISC Iranian  ] Supreme Leader [PER Ayatollah Khamenei  ] . 
Candidly , the [LOC U.S.  ] would like these events to distract [LOC Iran  ] for awhile from its other ambitions , such as pursuing its nuclear program , General [PER Petraeus  ] said . 
Although , it was too early to determine whether the current crisis had any significant impact on [LOC Iran  ] 's ability to support [ORG Hamas  ] , [ORG Hizballah  ] , or limit its ability to train and support foreign fighters in [LOC Iraq  ] , he added . 
[PER Siniora  ] agreed that there were definite cracks in the [MISC Iranian  ] system and the internal divisions should be exploited . 
However , [PER Siniora  ] warned against [LOC Israel  ] taking any military action against [LOC Iran  ] saying such action would only make the regional situation worse. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) General [PER Petraeus  ] responded that it was not the [LOC U.S.  ] desire to see outside force used against [LOC Iran  ] . 
Nonetheless , he observed , there was a phenomenon in the [LOC Gulf  ] states where leaders were worried someone would strike [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear weapons program , while also worrying that someone would not . 
[LOC Iran  ] , he continued , had become [ORG CENTCOM  ] 's best recruiting tool , and the number of partnerships and [LOC U.S.  ] military assistance agreements with [MISC Arab  ] partners in the [LOC Gulf  ] had increased significantly . 
[LOC PAKISTAN  ] AND [LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] ------------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Turning to other international developments , [PER Siniora  ] said he had heard a rumor that [LOC Pakistan  ] was ready to sell some of its nuclear stock to other countries . 
General [PER Petraeus  ] responded that this was almost certainly a rumor , but he refused to discount the possibility that [LOC Gulf  ] states may " start shopping " if [LOC Iran  ] acquired a nuclear weapon capability . 
He added that during his recent visit to [LOC Pakistan  ] , it was clear that for the first time the [MISC Pakistani  ] military viewed the [ORG Taliban  ] and other extremist groups as an existential threat to [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
The [MISC Pakistani  ] people , General [PER Petraeus  ] continued , were hugely supportive of its military 's efforts to fight against this extremist threat . 
There were some early signs of some success from [MISC Pakistani  ] operations. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) In [LOC Afghanistan  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] was increasing its troop levels by 38,000 from the beginning of 2009 and doubling the number of its helicopters , General [PER Petraeus  ] said . 
The war in [LOC Afghanistan  ] would be tough , and not easily won . 
One key will be the ability of the [MISC Afghan  ] government to " step up " to provide governance and be seen to serve the people in areas that have been cleared by [ORG Coalition  ] and [MISC Afghan  ] forces. . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] 's presidential election was scheduled for August 20 , General [PER Petraeus  ] added . 
It was likely , but not guaranteed that current [MISC Afghan  ] President [PER Hamid Karzai  ] would win , he predicted. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( U ) [ORG CENTCOM  ] Commander General [PER Petraeus  ] has cleared this message .
