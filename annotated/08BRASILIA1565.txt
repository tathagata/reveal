END SUMMARY . 
LONG THE LEADING CONTRIBUTOR <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Germany  ] has long played the leading role in the international effort on conserving the [LOC Amazon  ] forest . 
It was a major contributor to the [ORG G-7  ] 's Pilot Program to [ORG Conserve  ] the [MISC Brazilian  ] Rainforest ( PPG7 ) , which was created by the Group of 7 in 1992 and is now winding up . 
According to Dr. [PER Michael Grewe  ] , Counselor for Technical and [ORG Financial Assistance of the  ] [MISC German  ] Embassy in [LOC Brasilia  ] , the [MISC German  ] assistance agency [ORG KFW  ] as of September 2008 had contributed approximately 360 million [PER Euros  ] on sustainable forestry activities , protection of indigenous reservations , and land use planning and regulation . 
( [ORG REFTEL  ] A ) Further , [PER Jen Ochtrop  ] , the [ORG German Development Bank  ] 's ( [ORG KfW  ] ) [LOC Brazil  ] Director of Programs for the Management of [ORG Natural Resources  ] in an October 14 briefing for Embassy Science Officers outlined ambitious plans for future financial assistance . 
At that same briefing , the Dr. [PER Helmut Eger  ] , the Director of the [MISC German  ] Technical Assistance Agency 's ( [ORG GTZ  ] ) Program for the Protection and [ORG Sustainable Management of Tropical Forests  ] , described expanding an already impressive technical assistance program. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Germany  ] would still be the leading contributor to [LOC Brazil  ] in this area if [LOC Norway  ] had not announced in September a one billion dollar pledge to the [ORG Amazonas Fund  ] ( [ORG REFTEL  ] B ) . 
[LOC Germany  ] is still studying that fund and has not decided whether it will also contribute or not . 
During the October meeting , [PER Grewe  ] and [PER Ochtrop  ] expressed concerns over the lack of controls and transparency <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Germany  ] has established partnerships with the [ORG Ministry of the Environment  ] , [ORG FUNAI  ] ( the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Indian Aid Agency  ] ) , the [ORG Ministry of Agricultural  ] , and the [ORG State of Amazonas  ] . 
[ORG GTZ  ] and [ORG KfW  ] efforts focus on reducing deforestation and promoting sustainable development in the states of [LOC Amazonas  ] and [ORG Acre  ] . 
While [LOC Germany  ] is looking to expand its impressive environmental efforts , it is no longer working with [LOC Brazil  ] on projects to combat poverty . 
[PER Grewe  ] explained that this is because [LOC Germany  ] has determined that [LOC Brazil  ] , now a middle income country , has sufficient economic resources to carry out such activities on its own . 
AMBITIOUS PLANS FOR THE FUTURE <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) According to [PER Ochtrop  ] ( [ORG KfW  ] ) and [PER Egger  ] ( [ORG GTZ  ] ) , [LOC Germany  ] 's priority areas for [MISC Brazilian  ] cooperation are: forest conservation and sustainable use ; renewable energy and energy efficiency ; sustainable development of natural resources with a focus on protected areas ; demarcation and protection of indigenous lands ; and land use planning and regional development . 
[LOC Germany  ] is also working on capacity building with [ORG IBAMA  ] ( the [ORG Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources  ] ) , the [ORG Chico Mendes Institute  ] ( which manages conservation areas ) , and the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Forest Service  ] in the areas of knowledge management and capacity development . 
The majority of their capacity development work takes place in the [ORG State of Amazonas.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Germany  ] is heavily involved in projects with the [ORG Amazonas State Environmental Secretariat  ] as well as other state government institutions in the states of [LOC Amazonas  ] and [ORG Acre  ] . 
Much of this activity has occurred since July 2008 . 
[LOC Germany  ] participates in land management projects such as the formalizing of land titles and ownership records . 
The [MISC Germans  ] are looking for ways to support the introduction of programs for Reducing Emissions for Deforestation and [ORG Forest Degradation  ] ( [ORG REDD  ] ) , especially in [LOC Amazonas State  ] . 
CLIMATE CHANGE <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG KfW  ] has started a new climate protection initiative that originated in the [MISC German  ] environmental ministry . 
The [MISC German  ] government has allocated approximately 400 million [PER Euros  ] for international climate change projects , which will come from the auction of emission rights under a carbon trading scheme . 
Of this total , 120 million [PER Euros  ] have been set aside for the initial round of projects , and 20 million [PER Euros  ] are being designated specifically for use in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Over the last two years the [LOC Germany  ] has spent approximately 92 million [PER Euros  ] for climate related project . 
In regard to clean energy projects , [PER Grewe  ] told Science Officers that [LOC Germany  ] plans to spend about 100 million [PER Euros  ] on wind energy in [LOC Brazil  ] and 89 million [PER Euros  ] on a hydroelectric project . 
These will be implemented through the electric utilities [ORG Electrosul  ] and [ORG Electrobras  ] . 
COMMENT <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Germany  ] shares many of the [ORG USG  ] 's concerns and interests regarding deforestation and climate change in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[LOC Germany  ] has brought substantial financial and technical resources to help address these problems , and it plans to expand these efforts . 
Coordination of [ORG USG  ] efforts with [LOC Germany  ] and other contributors could offer opportunities to leverage our limited technical and financial resources in these critical areas .
