Lead Stories Summary The majority of dailies opened with reports on the failed terror attack on a [ORG Delta Airlines  ] jet , while Sueddeutsche headlined: " Protests Intensify - Riots in [LOC Iran  ] " and [ORG FAZ  ] led with the headline: " [MISC People Killed in Demonstrations  ] in [LOC Iran  ] . 
" Editorials focused on the failed terror attack in the [LOC U.S.  ] , with the unrest in [LOC Iran  ] and with the state of the coalition government in [LOC Berlin  ] . 
[ORG ZDF-TV  ] 's early evening newscast heute and [ORG ARD-TV  ] 's early evening newscast Tagesschau opened with a report on violent clashes between the [MISC Iranian  ] regime and opponents. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC U.S  ] . 
) Failed Terrorist Attack All papers carry extensive reports the failed terrorist attack on a [ORG Delta Airlines  ] airliners and reported that travelers flying to the [LOC United States  ] must expect heightened security measures and tougher restrictions on their flights to the [LOC United States  ] . 
[ORG Die Welt  ] headlined: " Terror Attempt Stirring up fear of Terror , " while [ORG Financial Times  ] headlined: " Fear of Terror is Back . 
" In a front-page editorial , [ORG Die Welt  ] ( 12/28 ) judged: " The fact that the would-be attacker was able to board a plane with his dangerous material reveals gaps in the control system . 
With metal detectors alone chemical explosives cannot be discovered . 
" Under the headline: " Flight 253 , " [ORG Frankfurter Allgemeine  ] ( 12/28 ) opined: " If someone really had believed that we have transnational terror under control , and that we can give an all-clear signal with respect to security , then those people have now been taught better . 
Irrespective of whether the attacker acted on his own or on the instructions of al-Qaida , the danger is not over and that is why travelers , not only to the [LOC Untied States  ] , must accept new inconveniences which are hopefully useful . 
" " Following the terror attempt in [LOC Detroit  ] , the usual security debate will now begin , " [ORG Frankfurter Rundschau  ] ( 12/28 ) noted , and added: " controls will be heightened , and agencies are trying to get us to do everything possible to prevent another attack . 
This failed terror attempt shows how unpredictable people can be who stop at nothing . 
For the time being , there is only one lesson we can learn from the events on Flight 253: It is the courageous effort of [PER Jasper Schuringa  ] who prevented even worse events . 
The unexpected resolve of individuals can be the right answer to the threat that comes out of the blue . 
" In the view of [ORG Stuttgarter Zeitung  ] ( 12/28 ) , " Abdulmutallab was miles [LOC BERLIN  ] 00001626 002 OF 005 away from the organizational level of the 9/11 attackers . 
But the [MISC Nigerian  ] national succeeded in one thing: he totally unnerved the western world , and the terror fighting machinery of the [LOC United States  ] in particular . 
Even though the [LOC U.S.  ] government knew about the danger of the young man , he was able to fly around the world without difficulty . 
Almost without any problems , he was able to smuggle dangerous substances aboard an aircraft . 
But what if he really had the order from al-Qaida in [LOC Yemen  ] to blow up the plane ? 
How does this view then fit the [LOC U.S.  ] focus on [LOC Afghanistan  ] ? 
Is [LOC Yemen  ] , too , a front in the anti-terror war ? 
Many question , but only a few answers . 
" Regional daily [ORG Nrnberger Nachrichten  ] ( 12/28 ) and regional daily [ORG Trierischer Volksfreund  ] ( 12/28 ) judged: " How was it possible for a young man to get aboard with a one-way ticket and an [MISC Arabic  ] sounding name , whose contacts with [MISC Islamic  ] extremists were known and whose father even warned the [LOC U.S.  ] embassy ? 
The lists of passengers travelling to the [LOC United States  ] are transferred in advance to the [ORG U.S. Homeland Security Department  ] with all its data bases . 
But again we see a big hole in the net that is supposed to capture potential terrorists . 
Of course , one hundred percent security will never exist , but these gaps are dramatic and should be an alarm call which politicians should not ignore . 
" [PER Mannheimer Morgen  ] ( 12/28 ) warned against hysteria and judged: " Each day terror investigators receive hundreds of tips and indications . 
How is it then possible to follow a vague suspicion ? 
We should not exaggerate security measures for flights . 
The fact that in the [LOC United States  ] no one is allowed to go to the bathroom one hour before landing is ridiculous . 
The same is true for the ban on liquids in [LOC Europe  ] . 
Here there is a clear disproportion between cost and benefit . 
" [ORG MQrkische Allgemeine of Potsdam  ] ( 12/28 ) opined: " If airlines , as a reaction to the failed attempt , force their passengers to remain seated one hour before landing , then this is no more than a gesture of helplessness . 
The second much more important aspect may be dissatisfying at the moment , but there is no way around it: [MISC Muslims  ] must preach again and again in their own ranks that terror is not the culmination of piety but a crime . 
Any incident like this should stress to the [MISC Muslim  ] world how urgent this message is . 
" Regional daily [ORG Westdeutsche Zeitung  ] of [LOC Dsseldorf  ] ( 12/28 ) observed: " Hectic measure such as barring passengers from getting up should not prevail in the long run . 
In the future , there will be no way around finding the right balance between possible improvements of our security standards compared to the trouble caused by them . 
" [PER SchwarzwQlder Bote  ] ( 12/28 ) noted: " Everything we have learned about this attack does not strengthen our confidence in international [LOC BERLIN  ] 00001626 003 OF 005 security measures . 
It is certainly right that there cannot be absolute security from mean terrorist attacks but this does not the least excuse the gaps in anti-terror measures. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC Iran  ] ) New Protests All papers carry extensive coverage of the new clashes between the regime and opposition forces in [LOC Iran  ] . 
Sueddeutsche headlined: " Protests Intensify - Riots in [LOC Iran  ] " and [ORG FAZ  ] led with the headline: " [MISC People Killed in  ] Demonstrations in [LOC Iran  ] . 
" [ORG Frankfurter Rundschau  ] reported on its front page: " The protests are directed against [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] . 
" The paper also reported that " according to reports from [LOC Tehran  ] , police officers partly disobeyed orders to use their guns against the protesters . 
The [MISC Internet  ] page " Jaras , " which is critical of the government , reported that 's ome [ police officers ] tried to fire their guns in the air when their superiors put pressure on them.' 
" Sueddeutsche Zeitung ( 12/28 ) said in an editorial under the headline: " There is Growing Unrest among the [MISC People  ] " that " if the information fragments from [LOC Tehran  ] on the demonstrations during the [LOC Ashura  ] holidays allow one conclusion , then this one: the rank and file of the protests are now overtaking their leaders . 
Posters of religious leader [PER Ali Khamenei  ] and the chorus of demonstrators who want to see the dictator dead do not correspond with the slogans of the two opposition leaders [ORG Moussawi  ] and [ORG Charrubi  ] . 
They are now faced with a dilemma: If they stick to their view that they , in principle , recognize the institutions of the [MISC Islamic  ] republic and want to use the courts to make their political opposition heard , then it could be that their followers will leave them because many want something else: regime change . 
" Regional daily [ORG Suedwest Presse of Ulm  ] ( 12/28 ) editorialized: " The regime is using all its might to extinguish the massive protests . 
The few [MISC Internet  ] reports in any case show the brutality of the leading clique around President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] . 
In the meantime , the regime has its back to the wall . 
The protests are no longer confined to [LOC Tehran  ] but are spreading to other cities... . 
The government can no longer afford the good deeds with which it bought the loyalty of [MISC Iranians  ] . 
All this is really worrying for the international community of nations . 
" [ORG Ostsee Zeitung  ] of [LOC Rostock  ] ( 12/28 ) argued: " Despite jammed cellular phone networks and despite blocked access to the [MISC Internet  ] , the unrest in [LOC Iran  ] hardly seems to be stoppable . 
The resistance is still limited to a well-educated cosmopolitan , young , urban middle class . 
Large sectors of the population , however , seem to keep quiet or seem to [LOC BERLIN  ] 00001626 004 OF 005 support the regime . 
But the cyber revolt in [LOC Tehran  ] has demonstrated that the mullahs no longer enjoy a monolithic power . 
" Regional daily [ORG Dresdner Neueste Nachrichten  ] ( 12/28 ) opined: " Since the allegedly manipulated re-election of President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , a state of emergency has dominated in [LOC Iran  ] . 
But this is not only the struggle of a limited political protest movement against the president and the ayatollahs behind him . 
The country is now facing an endurance test . 
At issue is whether the country wants to become a fundamental religious state or an [MISC Islamic  ] republic . 
The pictures from [LOC Iran  ] are shocking . 
It is the violence on both sides that makes us fear the worst . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC China  ] ) Reaction to Jailing of [ORG Liu Xiabo Frankfurter Allgemeine  ] ( 12/28 ) editorialized under the headline: " [MISC Co- Responsibility  ] , " that foreign countries must also be blamed that a man like [ORG Liu Xiabo  ] is jailed with such an absurdly high prison term . 
The foreign countries have treated [LOC China  ] for economic considerations with political kid gloves for years . 
We can't blame [LOC China  ] under these circumstances because we think that it is unassailable ? 
A positive reaction to any criticism of the verdict cannot be expected . 
" Sueddeutsche Zeitung ( 12/28 ) said in an editorial: " A subtle but clearly visible trend is getting hold in [LOC China  ] . 
Civil disobedience among the rank and file is spreading . 
It is an irony that this tend has become visible in the tough verdict against [ORG Liu Xiabo  ] . 
In front of the court in which [LOC China  ] 's leadership organized the show trial , we could not only see international reporters and diplomats , but [MISC Chinese  ] supporters of [ORG Liu  ] shouted slogans and unrolled posters thus deliberately risking their arrest . 
Only a few courageous people went to the court , but they showed that intimidation no longer works as successfully as in the past . 
This new trend is not only confined to the traditional political protest . 
Courageous lawyers of the [MISC Weiquan  ] civil rights movement are defending victims of the arbitrariness of state agencies and they defend each other , too . 
And the number of peaceful and violent civil protests is on the rise . 
But the [ORG Chinese Communist Party  ] fails miserably when it comes to channeling communication with its critics into a constructive direction . 
The verdict against [ORG Liu Xiabo  ] is one more example . 
It will only partially obtain the desired effect but not intimidate the people . 
At the same time , new embitterment , new disobedience is growing . 
With each show trial , the party is now doing of what it is accusing [MISC Liu:  ] it undermines the state 's authority . 
" [LOC BERLIN  ] 00001626 005 OF 005 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC U.S  ] . 
) Healthcare Reform Under the headline: " Reform Blues , " Sueddeutsche Zeitung ( 12/28 ) had this to say: " There is no doubt that the healthcare reform bill that has now been adopted in the [ORG Senate  ] is a great work...and trailblazing . 
But enthusiasm about the success is limited . 
One reason is that the legislative process is so tiresome ; but there is an even more important reason: disappointment and doubts are spreading . 
The advocates of the reform have been brought down to earth again because they were able to implement only a few of their demands . 
Thus far , the [MISC Democrats  ] have lost the fight for public opinion . 
They will have to do quite a lot in the election campaign in 2010 to avoid being punished for a reasonable reform . 
" [ORG Die Welt  ] ( 12/28 ) argued: " The [MISC Democrats  ] will now have difficulty explaining to their irritated voters why it is historic progress that 31 million compatriots who have no coverage today will get health insurance , and that health insurance companies can no longer reject sick [MISC Americans  ] or demand astronomically high premiums . 
This reform is supposed to carry itself and not burden the budget . 
But the opponents to the bill do not believe a word , arguing that the nation will go bankrupt . 
This is a highly imperfect , weakened bill and , at the same time , a giant step forward into an [MISC American  ] future in which job loss no longer means the end of insurance protection for a former employee and their whole family .
