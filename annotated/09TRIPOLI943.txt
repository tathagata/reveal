Polaschik  ] , Charge d'Affaires , [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy [ORG Tripoli  ] , [ORG Department of State  ] . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Pol/Econ Chief met MFA [MISC Americas Acting A/S-equivalent  ] [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] December 1 to convey our serious concerns about the security of the seven [MISC HEU-filled  ] casks at the [ORG Tajoura Nuclear Facility  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] dismissed [LOC U.S.  ] concerns , stating there was " no one sophisticated enough " in [LOC Libya  ] to be able to do anything with the casks and that the chances of anything happening were very low . 
He mentioned the [ORG IAEA  ] seals as evidence that the fuel was protected ( Ref A ) . 
Pol/Econ Chief underscored that the GOL should be concerned about the situation , as the casks were easily transportable and [ORG Tajoura  ] was a poorly protected facility . 
[LOC U.S.  ] DOE specialists had recommended an increased security guard presence -- armed if possible -- around [ORG Tajoura  ] and the disengagement of the crane inside the facility . 
Pol/Econ Chief emphasized that the casks were easily transportable , and advised him not to be too dismissive of the security risks involved in keeping the casks unprotected . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that he would meet with Foreign Minister [PER Musa Kusa  ] today to relay our concerns. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Pol/Econ Chief also described the environmental disaster that could take place if we did not ship the casks to [LOC Russia  ] for disposal within a month . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] needed a decision from the [MISC Libyan  ] side as soon as possible on the shipment , as it would take time to reschedule the travel of the specialized [MISC Russian  ] plane , including overflight permits , landing permits , and negotiating with the [MISC Russian  ] MFA to cancel other scheduled stops . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was not aware of how complicated it would be to schedule a return visit of the plane , although he understood that only a few such planes exist in the world . 
He said he agreed that a decision needed to be passed to us within a few weeks. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was not aware that Dr. [PER Gashut  ] claimed to have prepared a document for senior regime officials listing all of the environmental dangers associated with holding the shipment back . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that [PER Gashut  ] probably gave the paper to Prime Mininster-equivalent al-Baghdad al-Mahmoudi ( [PER Gashut  ] 's boss ) but did not think it had been passed to the MFA . 
( [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] may well have been unaware of any communications between [PER Gashut  ] and [PER Kusa  ] on this issue . 
) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] promised to call us after he had briefed [MISC Kusa.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) We also are seeking a meeting with [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhaif 's aide [PER Mohamed Ismail Ahmed  ] to relay the same information , in hopes of ensuring that senior [MISC Libyan  ] officials understand the grave security and safety risks posed by the halted shipment .
