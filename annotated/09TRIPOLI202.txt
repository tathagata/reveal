Christopher Stevens  ] , [ORG DCM  ] . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) [MISC Summary: Your  ] visit comes two weeks after the most recent [ORG Council of Colonels  ] meeting in [LOC Tripoli  ] and as [LOC Libya  ] is faced with key decisions on its future course in both domestic and [MISC African  ] politics . 
[LOC Libya  ] 's parliament voted on March 4 to defer a decision on Muammar al-Qadhafi 's controversial proposal to distribute the country 's oil wealth directly to the people and disband most government ministries . 
On Wednesday , It also approved a cabinet shake-up with intelligence chief [PER Musa Kusa  ] as the new foreign minister ; there were no changes in the military leadership . 
Last month 's election to the [ORG African Union  ] chairmanship provides al-Qadhafi with a high-profile platform from which he can trumpet his vision of [LOC Africa  ] and rail against [MISC Western  ] interference on the continent . 
Regime officials , and al-Qadhafi in particular , value relationships with high-level [MISC Western  ] officials and your visit provides an excellent opportunity to develop the rapport necessary to cultivate future gains here . 
You are the first [MISC COCOM  ] commander to visit [LOC Libya  ] since the evacuation of [ORG Wheelus Air Force Base  ] - now styled [ORG Mitiga Air Base  ] and the airfield at which you will land - in the early 1970s ; an historic first coming on the heels of the September 2008 visit of then-Secretary of State [PER Condoleezza Rice  ] and the signing of a [MISC Mil-Mil  ] [ORG MOU  ] in January 2009 . 
End summary . 
Key issues: -- [ORG AFRICOM  ] 's mandate -- [ORG Transnational  ] terrorism ( [ORG AQIM  ] in the [LOC Sahel/Sahara  ] ) and humanitarian assistance -- Technology and lethal weapon sales to [LOC Libya  ] -- [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG African Union  ] chair -- [MISC African  ] crises: [LOC Darfur  ] , [LOC Somalia  ] , [LOC Mauritania  ] -- Developing working-level ties LIBYA: POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC BACKGROUND 2 . 
( [LOC S//NF  ] ) After several years of negotiation , [LOC Libya  ] fulfilled its obligations under the [MISC Comprehensive Claims Settlement Agreement  ] - providing funds for the victims of [PER Pam Am  ] 103 and [PER LaBelle  ] bombings , among others - on October 31 , 2008 . 
The implementation allowed us to move forward on the [MISC Mil-Mil  ] [ORG MOU  ] , which was signed in [LOC Washington  ] in January . 
It also increased the number of high-level visits between the two countries including [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi 's two-week trip to the [LOC US  ] in November and his brother [PER Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi 's trip to [LOC Washington  ] planned for April . 
Despite the high-level interest in deepening the relationship , several old-guard regime figures remain skeptical about the re-engagement project and some facets of our interaction remain at the mercy of the often mercurial inner circle . 
Muammar al-Qadhafi started his political life as an ardent Nasserite . 
He has more recently shifted to [MISC Pan-Africanism  ] in an attempt to broaden his influence into countries where support can be purchased less dearly . 
He very likely believes his own rhetoric that he is a champion for a continent that suffered 400 years of colonization . 
More pragmatically , the [MISC Libyan  ] leadership is wary of foreign influence inside its sphere of influence . 
3 . 
( [LOC S//NF  ] ) While al-Qadhafi has recently seized the [MISC African  ] spotlight , the domestic political and economic situation is at a critical juncture as the regime weighs the benefits of modernization and opening to the West with maintaining its grip on government and industry . 
[PER Al-Qadhafi  ] routinely shifts influence between his lieutenants to keep the power structure unbalanced - a tactic he also employs with his children . 
Two sons - [PER Saif  ] al-Islam ( head of the [ORG quasi-NGO Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] ) and [PER Muatassim  ] ( head of [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG National Security Council  ] ) - are thought to be possible heirs to their father 's mantle . 
[PER Muatassim  ] , with whom you will meet , has been a proponent of improved ties with the [LOC US  ] , and is eager to purchase [LOC US  ] weaponry . 
The potential for political turmoil is compounded by prospects for economic reform . 
The lifting of sanctions and attendant increases in consumer spending have exacerbated the disparity between the elite and the poor . 
[PER Al-Qadhafi  ] proposed abolishing the General People 's Committee system ( the ministry system of which he is the author ) in favor of distributing oil wealth to citizens in the form of large monthly checks , but the global financial crisis and the dramatic fall of oil prices have caused [MISC Libyan  ] policy makers to rethink both their domestic reform agenda and the extent to which they can purchase influence in [LOC Africa  ] . 
The parliament -- " the General People 's [MISC Congress  ] " -- voted on March 4 to defer al-Qadhafi 's [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000202 002 OF 003 wealth-distribution proposal . 
It also approved a new cabinet , keeping the prime minister but replacing the foreign minister , [PER Abdulrahman Shalgam  ] , with the head of [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG External Security Organization  ] , [PER Musa Kusa  ] . 
No changes were made to the military leadership . 
AFRICOM'S MANDATE: [LOC LIBYA  ] AGAINST BOOTS AND BASES 4 . 
( [LOC S//NF  ] ) Since the former Secretary of State 's visit to [LOC Tripoli  ] in September , regime officials have slowly come to terms with [ORG AFRICOM  ] as we have explained more of your mission . 
A clear explanation of [ORG AFRICOM  ] 's mandate and expected activities on the continent , as well as a two-way discussion on areas of military-to-military cooperation will be welcomed by your interlocutors . 
Reiterating [ORG AFRICOM  ] 's support and humanitarian roles while allaying their fears about [MISC American  ] troops or bases on the continent is another message they will be keen to receive . 
While [LOC Libya  ] is a strong partner on counterterrorism , the [MISC Libyans  ] remain wary of initiatives that put foreign military or intelligence assets too close to their borders . 
They are unlikely to join the [ORG Trans-Sahara Counter Terrorism Partnership  ] , due as much to unwillingness to appear subservient to [LOC US  ] interests as genuine distrust of [LOC U.S.  ] intentions from certain old-guard regime elements . 
Negotiations on the [MISC Mil-Mil  ] [ORG MOU  ] stalled on [MISC Libyan  ] insistence that the language include security assurances on par with our [ORG NATO  ] obligations . 
[ORG AFRICOM  ] 's capacity-building component and support for peacekeeping forces may appease some , but we expect your military interlocutors will use your visit as an opportunity to tie their cooperation to security assurances . 
[ORG TRANSNATIONAL TERRORISM  ] AND HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE 5 . 
( [LOC S//NF  ] ) [LOC Libya  ] is a top partner in combating transnational terrorism . 
The regime is genuinely concerned about the rise of [MISC Islamic  ] terrorism in the [LOC Sahel  ] and [LOC Sahara  ] and worries that instability and weak governments to their south could lead to a " belt of terrorism " stretching from [LOC Mauritania  ] to [LOC Somalia  ] . 
[PER Al-Qadhafi  ] prides himself on his recent initiatives with [MISC Tuareg  ] tribes to persuade them to lay down arms and spurn cooperation with al-Qaeda elements in the border region ; this is an issue worth exploring with him , while being mindful that he will oppose [LOC U.S.  ] military activity in what he views as his backyard . 
He is also proud of his humantarian activities on the continent , which are directed principally on behalf of women and children . 
[LOC Libya  ] recognizes that [MISC African  ] peacekeeping and regional security forces are poorly trained and equipped and several diplomats have indicated they would be amenable to continued [LOC US  ] assistance in these areas . 
[PER Al-Qadhafi  ] makes a distinction between " imperialist " countries and " colonizing " ones , but walks a fine line between seeking military assistance from [MISC European  ] powers he views as responsible for [LOC Africa  ] 's ills while keeping a hard line on national sovereignty . 
[LOC Libya  ] 's recent " friendship treaty " with [LOC Italy  ] held the old colonial power responsible for de-mining circa WWII ordinance still in [LOC Libya  ] . 
We have proposed a [LOC US  ] role under [ORG UN  ] auspices on de-mining ; they await an al-Qadhafi imprimatur before beginning their program and are concerned that a DOD or [ORG USG  ] affiliation could make humanitarian assistance a tougher sell . 
[LOC LIBYA  ] SEEKS [LOC US  ] LETHAL AND NON-LETHAL MILITARY EQUIPMENT 6 . 
( [LOC S//NF  ] ) Throughout the negotiations to close outstanding compensation claims and re-open to the [LOC US  ] , [MISC Libyan  ] officials have been keen to purchase [LOC US  ] military equipment - both lethal and non-lethal . 
[PER Muatassim  ] met with then A/S [PER David Welch  ] on the margins of the Secretary 's September visit and [MISC Libyan  ] officials presented " wish lists " in the context of signing the [MISC Mil-Mil  ] [ORG MOU  ] . 
[PER Muatassim  ] accompanied his father on a high-profile trip to [LOC Moscow  ] in October to discuss potential deals , but his father 's trips to [LOC Belarus  ] and [LOC Ukraine  ] were seen as an attempt to bring the price-point down for weapons deals . 
Their wish-lists comprise both lethal and non-lethal materiel and we have told the [ORG GOL  ] that sales will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis , particularly since not all senior [ORG USG  ] leaders who would have a say on the subject have been appointed by the new administration . 
You are likely to hear two familiar refrains: that the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" owes " [LOC Libya  ] security cooperation ( read: sales and security guarantees ) in return for al-Qadhafi 's decision to give up his WMD aspirations ; and that the [LOC U.S.  ] should return or reimburse [LOC Libya  ] for the [MISC C130s  ] it purchased in the 1970s which [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000202 003 OF 003 were ultimately never delivered . 
In effect , the [MISC Libyans  ] have made military sales a key litmus of [LOC US  ] trust and future intentions . 
In response , you might say that the [LOC U.S.  ] looks forward to developing the bilateral security relationship and this process will take time ; the [MISC C130s  ] are a commercial matter best pursued with [ORG Lockheed-Martin  ] . 
LIBYA'S [ORG AFRICAN UNION CHAIR  ] 7 . 
( [LOC S//NF  ] ) Muammar al-Qadhafi 's chairmanship of the [ORG African Union  ] will be a rhetorical hurdle that [ORG AFRICOM  ] must clear throughout the year . 
However , there is some distance between what al-Qadhafi says and what [MISC Libyan  ] officials are willing and able to implement . 
The Leader is temperamental and makes decisions based on personal relationships . 
Deference for his leadership on the continent may appeal to him ; the perception that the [LOC US  ] military knows what is best for [LOC Africa  ] will not . 
He has shown that he is willing to stake bilateral relationships on family honor , first with [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] and currently in the ongoing diplomatic row caused by his son [PER Hannibal  ] 's July 2008 arrest in [LOC Geneva  ] . 
Despite his vocal rebukes of [MISC Western  ] influence in [LOC Africa  ] , al-Qadhafi needs his chairmanship to be seen as a success - a potentially useful opening for increased engagement . 
When possible , crafting programs that give [LOC Libya  ] symbolic leadership reduces the chance that al-Qadhafi will play the spoiler . 
[LOC DARFUR  ] , [LOC SOMALIA  ] , MAURITANIA: LIBYA'S ROLE 8 . 
( [LOC S//NF  ] ) The combination of al-Qadhafi 's continental ambitions , concerns about the destabilizing potential of militant [MISC Islam  ] in the [LOC Sahel  ] , and reticence to have foreign troops too near its borders have compelled [LOC Libya  ] to insert itself in [MISC African  ] crises - to mixed results . 
It is worth raising the crises with [LOC Libya  ] 's top leadership to give the [LOC US  ] a better picture of [LOC Libya  ] 's potential action in these theaters . 
In [LOC Sudan  ] , [LOC Libya  ] is expected to lead the charge at the [ORG United Nations  ] against an [ORG ICC  ] prosecution of [PER Bashir  ] . 
[LOC Libya  ] mediated between the governments in [LOC N'Djamena  ] and [LOC Khartoum  ] and secured an exchange of ambassadors between the two capitals last year . 
Their support for rebel groups seems to have waned in the past year . 
The regime is upset that [LOC Qatar  ] has diminished what [LOC Libya  ] views as its influence in [LOC Darfur  ] and al-Qadhafi appears to be shifting from practical diplomacy ( and the cash that comes with it ) to lambasting the [LOC West  ] and [LOC Israel  ] for causing the trouble between the Fur and [LOC Khartoum  ] . 
In [LOC Somalia  ] , the regime showed modest support for [PER Abullahi Yusuf  ] but shifted to [LOC Sheikh Sharif  ] when it became clear he would take power . 
While al-Qadhafi has defended [MISC Somali  ] pirates as " defenders against foreign intervention " in [LOC Somalia  ] , [LOC Libya  ] 's actual policies remain in concert with those of the [ORG UN Security Council  ] . 
[LOC Libya  ] supports June elections in [LOC Mauritania  ] , but notes that the coup was a " special " coup since the parliament - and therefore the people - support the junta . 
[PER Al-Qadhafi  ] is engaged personally on the issue and has hosted senior-level [MISC Mauritanian  ] officials from both camps in the past week . 
REGULARIZING WORKING-LEVEL CONTACTS 9 . 
( [LOC S//NF  ] ) [MISC Libyan  ] officials value personal relationships with high-ranking [MISC Western  ] officials . 
However , they lack both a bureaucratic capacity and willingness on the working levels to manage the day-to-day business of bilateral relations . 
In your meetings with [LOC Libya  ] military counterparts , it would be helpful to emphasize the important [MISC SAO  ] role of the [ORG DAO  ] , highlighting the [ORG DAO  ] as the primary address for [MISC Mil-Mil  ] engagement . 
[ORG WELCOME  ] 10 . 
( C ) We are confident that your visit to [LOC Tripoli  ] will open new doors for continued cooperation . 
Military cooperation is a key metric to determine the extent to which the [MISC Libyan  ] government wishes to engage with the [LOC US  ] . 
We hope your visit will assuage the fears of the more conservative elements of the regime while paving the way for [ORG AFRICOM  ] 's continued success .
