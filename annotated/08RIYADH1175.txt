( S ) Recent conversations with the Assistant Minister of [ORG Petroleum  ] , the [ORG Ministries of Foreign Affairs  ] and [ORG Finance  ] , and the [MISC Pakistani  ] Embassy point to one conclusion: the [MISC Saudi  ] offer to assist [LOC Pakistan  ] by deferring crude oil payments is proceeding slowly . 
With King [PER Abdullah  ] , [ORG Petroleum  ] Minister [PER Naimi  ] , Foreign Minister [PER Saud al Faisal  ] , and Assistant Minister of [ORG Petroleum  ] Prince [PER Abdulaziz  ] all out of the country on vacation , absent [ORG USG  ] intervention , the proposal is unlikely to advance substantially until September. ------------------------------- MinPet Unaware of Any Progress ------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) In a July 30 phone call from [LOC London  ] , Assistant Minister of [ORG Petroleum  ] Prince [PER Abdulaziz  ] bin [MISC Salman  ] bin [PER Abdulaziz Al-Saud  ] was surprised to hear we were interested in discussing the [MISC Saudi  ] proposal to defer payments for crude sales for [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
He stated he had heard nothing about the proposal since the June 22 oil summit in [LOC Jeddah  ] . 
[PER Abdulaziz  ] , who led the [LOC Jeddah  ] summit and holds the international portfolio for the [ORG Ministry of Petroleum  ] ( MinPet ) , promised nonetheless to look into progress on the negotiations , and call us again tomorrow. -------------------------------------- Deal At [LOC Least  ] a Month Away ? 
[PER Saudis Reluctant  ] with Crude Prices so High -------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) In a July 30 meeting with [LOC Pakistan  ] Embassy Commercial Counselor [PER Zia Shams  ] , [PER Shams  ] told us , “The deal is not finalized , it is in negotiations.” He clarified that [LOC Pakistan  ] did not expect to alter its regular schedule of crude oil deliveries from [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , but had requested a deferred payment scheme . 
He explained [LOC Pakistan  ] could have turned to the [ORG IMF  ] for assistance , but had hoped terms would be easier working with [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
[PER Shams  ] told us [LOC Pakistan  ] had requested the assistance when oil was about $147/barrel , but negotiations still had not concluded . 
[PER Shams  ] fretted that , “Muslim brotherhood is not what it used to be , these deals have become very commercialized.” The [MISC Saudi  ] government had explained they could not do a deal with oil prices so high , [PER Shams  ] noted . 
[LOC Saudi Arabia  ] is concerned that if [LOC Pakistan  ] were awarded payment concessions , other major developing nations such as [LOC India  ] would make similar demands . 
[PER Shams  ] believes a deal might be concluded if crude prices continue to slide . 
At the conclusion of the meeting , [PER Shams  ] whispered that he thought a “deal was likely a month away.” <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) [PER Shams  ] indicated any encouragement the [ORG USG  ] might offer for the proposal would go a long way to see that it was implemented in time to avoid further chaos in [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[PER Shams  ] told us that the new [MISC Pakistani  ] government had been forced to raise gasoline prices by 60 percent and diesel prices ( key to the transport sector ) by 100 percent since March . 
The price increases were pushing the population to the limit and fueling extremism , he said. ----------------------------- [MISC MFA Has No Knowledge  ] of Deal ----------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) On July 30 , the [PER Charge D’Affaires  ] met with Ambassador [PER Khalid Al Jindan  ] , the third ranking diplomat at the [MISC MFA  ] , and the Director of [ORG Western Affairs  ] . 
Ambassador [PER Al Jindan  ] had no knowledge of the deal . 
Nonetheless , he said there was wide agreement within the [MISC Saudi  ] government on the need to do everything possible to support Pakistan’s internal stability . 
RIYADH 00001175 002 OF 002 -------------------------------------------- [ORG Ministry of Finance: Deal Still  ] with MinPet --------------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) [PER Hamad Najashi  ] from the [ORG International Relations Office  ] at the [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] shed some light on the process for negotiating such oil relief packages . 
He verified MinPet was the lead negotiator for such programs . 
Once a relief package was agreed upon , it would be forwarded to the [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] ( [ORG MOF  ] ) for financial processing . 
After researching the issue with counterparts in the international assistance area , he told us the [ORG MOF  ] has not seen the [LOC Pakistan  ] proposal , because the agreement was not yet concluded. -------- Comment -------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) Prince Abdulaziz’s apparent ignorance of any recent developments on the [MISC Saudi  ] offer to assist [LOC Pakistan  ] suggests there has been no movement since the June 22 [LOC Jeddah  ] summit . 
Prince [PER Abdulaziz  ] would be aware of , if not leading , any negotiations with [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
Taken together with the comments from the MFA’s Ambassador [PER Al Jindan  ] , the [MISC Pakistani  ] Counselor , and the [ORG MOF  ] , it appears the [MISC Saudi  ] offer has been shelved until a decline in oil prices make it more palatable for MinPet to implement . 
The [MISC Saudi  ] royal family and senior officials are on vacation now , to be followed by the September Ramadan season . 
If we see rapid implementation of the offer as critically important to the [LOC Pakistan  ] government’s stability , it will likely take [ORG USG  ] intervention at the highest levels with senior [MISC Saudi  ] officials now in [LOC Morocco  ] to secure its rapid implementation .
