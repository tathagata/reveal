( C ) Summary: [MISC Libyan  ] Foreign Minister [PER Musa Kusa  ] told the [MISC British  ] Ambassador August 15 that convicted [MISC Pan Am 103  ] bomber [PER Abdel Bassett  ] al [PER Megrahi  ] is a very ill man , too ill for anything but a quiet return to his family . 
While the [MISC British  ] Ambassador , who had raised the [PER Megrahi  ] case on instructions from [LOC London  ] , was encouraged by Kusa’s comments , he also noted that only one man -- [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] -- would decide [ORG Megrahi’s  ] true reception in [LOC Libya  ] . 
Building on Qadhafi’s comments to [PER CODEL McCain  ] ( ref ) , the Executive Director of the [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] ( [ORG QDF  ] ) told us August 16 that the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Government  ] “as a democracy” could not control any spontaneous demonstrations by the people in support of [ORG Megrahi’s  ] return . 
The [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Government  ] may be gearing up for a two-pronged approach on [ORG Megrahi’s  ] return: an official policy of no celebrations , coupled with a disingenuous denial of any involvement in “spontaneous” celebrations that could erupt upon [ORG Megrahi’s  ] return . 
It may be useful to engage Foreign Minister [PER Musa Kusa  ] on this issue . 
End summary . 
[LOC UK  ] AMBASSADOR: [PER MUSA  ] [PER KUSA  ] INDICATES A QUIET RETURN <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [LOC UK  ] Ambassador Sir [PER Vincent Fean  ] told the Charge August 15 that he had met [MISC Libyan  ] Foreign Minister [PER Musa Kusa  ] earlier on the same day , on instructions from [LOC London  ] , to discuss the potential release from a [MISC Scottish  ] prison of convicted [MISC Pan Am 103  ] bomber [PER Abdel Bassett  ] al [PER Megrahi  ] . 
Stressing that he had addressed the issue as a hypothetical scenario , [PER Fean  ] said that he had urged the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Government  ] to handle [ORG Megrahi’s  ] possible release in a very low-profile manner . 
According to [PER Fean  ] , [PER Kusa  ] responded that [PER Megrahi  ] is a very sick man , and is too ill for anything but a quiet return to his family . 
While the [MISC British  ] Ambassador interpreted Kusa’s response as positive , he also noted that only one man -- [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] -- would determine [ORG Megrahi’s  ] true reception in [LOC Libya  ] . 
He expects to receive a personal letter from Prime Minister [PER Gordon Brown  ] to [PER Qadhafi  ] on this issue , for delivery this week. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [MISC British  ] Ambassador expressed relief that [PER Megrahi  ] likely would be returned to [LOC Libya  ] under the compassionate release program . 
He noted that a refusal of [ORG Megrahi’s  ] request could have had disastrous implications for [MISC British  ] interests in [LOC Libya.  ] “They could have cut us off at the knees , just like the [MISC Swiss  ] , ” [PER Fean  ] bluntly said . 
He also expressed hope that the [PER Megrahi  ] issue would not have a negative impact on [MISC U.S.-UK  ] relations , commenting that “we have lots of other issues on the agenda right now.” The Ambassador stressed that he had no further information on timing for [ORG Megrahi’s  ] possible release but said that he expected a decision “soon.” QADHAFI FOUNDATION: THE PEOPLE WILL DECIDE HOW [PER MEGRAHI  ] IS RECEIVED <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) During an August 16 meeting , [ORG QDF  ] Executive Director [PER Yusuf Sawani  ] passionately argued on behalf of [ORG Megrahi’s  ] right to receive compassionate release from the [MISC Scottish  ] judicial system . 
Stating that “everyone in [LOC Libya  ] was more than surprised by the official [ORG USG  ] reaction on the issue , ” he argued that the [LOC United States  ] , as a civilized , democratic nation , should not stand in the way of an official decision made by the [MISC Scottish  ] judicial system . 
He described the [LOC U.S.  ] justice system as infamous for making mistakes and jailing innocent people but emphasized that even convicted criminals were entitled to certain rights within the [LOC U.S.  ] legal system . 
Referring to [MISC CODEL McCain’s  ] recent press statements , he said that he understood that [LOC U.S.  ] congressmen must respond to the positions of their constituencies , but he did not understand why members of the [ORG U.S. Administration  ] would object to [ORG Megrahi’s  ] release on compassionate grounds . 
He accused the [ORG U.S. Administration  ] of attempting to interfere politically with the [MISC Scottish  ] judicial system , in an effort to exact “revenge” on [PER Megrahi  ] for his crimes. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The Charge reminded [PER Sawani  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] position remained unchanged: while we will not interfere in the [MISC Scottish  ] procedures , we continue to believe that [PER Megrahi  ] should serve out the remainder of his life sentence in a [MISC Scottish  ] prison . 
Noting that the repatriation of [PER Megrahi  ] was recently unveiled by the [ORG QDF  ] as one of its three priority objectives , the Charge strongly urged [PER Sawani  ] and the [ORG QDF  ] to treat [ORG Megrahi’s  ] potential return in a low-key manner . 
[PER Sawani  ] expressed agreement that the official [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Government  ] response to a [PER Megrahi  ] release should be quiet , but he insisted that the [MISC Libyan  ] people would ultimately decide how to react to [ORG Megrahi’s  ] return . 
Although he denied that the [ORG QDF  ] would play any role in organizing any demonstrations in support of [PER Megrahi  ] , [PER Sawani  ] asked heatedly whether the [LOC U.S.  ] would demand that the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Government  ] set up barricades and send police to quell demonstrations in honor of [ORG Megrahi’s  ] return. “No one can object to [MISC Libyans  ] expressing their feelings if [PER Megrahi  ] comes back , ” he said , “this is democracy.” [PER Sawani  ] warned that [LOC U.S.  ] objections to [ORG Megrahi’s  ] release would resurrect [MISC Libyans’  ] former views of the [LOC U.S.  ] as a “tyrant nation , ” to which the Charge responded that a hero’s welcome for [PER Megrahi  ] undoubtedly would elicit a similarly strong reaction among the [MISC American  ] people . 
[PER Sawani  ] conceded that it would be important for both sides to carefully manage this extremely sensitive issue. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [MISC Comment: Based  ] on comments from [PER Kusa  ] and [PER Sawani  ] , the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Government  ] may be gearing up for a two-pronged approach on [ORG Megrahi’s  ] return: an official policy of no celebrations , coupled with a disingenuous denial of any involvement in “spontaneous” celebrations that could erupt upon [ORG Megrahi’s  ] return . 
The latter scenario makes sense in the context of [PER Muammar  ] and [MISC Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi’s comments to [PER CODEL McCain  ] that the [ORG GOL  ] could not prevent the [MISC Libyan  ] people from giving [PER Megrahi  ] a hero’s welcome ( ref ) . 
Given Foreign Minister [PER Musa Kusa’s  ] pragmatic understanding of the broader strategic interests at stake , it may be useful to engage him on this issue .
