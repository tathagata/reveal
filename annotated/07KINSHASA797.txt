( S ) Several sources have recently stated that the [ORG Malta Forest Company  ] is mining and exporting uranium from the [LOC Democratic Republic  ] of [LOC Congo  ] ( [ORG DRC  ] ) . 
According to reports , [LOC Malta Forest  ] does this by mining the uranified rock while mining copper and cobalt , then exporting the uranified ore and circumventing radiation testing by using an established system of corrupt government officials . 
Foreign companies then purchase the uranified ore and refine it abroad to separate the uranium , copper and cobalt . 
In this way , foreign companies purchase uranium from [LOC Malta Forest  ] , while [LOC Malta Forest  ] appears to be exporting copper and cobalt . 
In 2006 , for example , a [MISC Finish  ] company reportedly told the [ORG International Atomic Energy Commission  ] ( [ORG IAEA  ] ) that they imported one ton of uranium from the [ORG DRC  ] . 
The [ORG DRC  ] , however , claimed that it did not export any uranium in 2006. ---------------------------- [ORG Radioactive Mines  ] in [LOC Katanga  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) All of [ORG Katanga Province  ] could be said to be somewhat radioactive . 
Some areas are more radioactive than others , however , and there have been recent reports that several Katangan mines have abnormally high levels of radiation . 
Per REF , between 23 and 29 May , the [LOC Democratic Republic  ] of [LOC Congo  ] ( [ORG DRC  ] ) [ORG Ministry of Mines and Property  ] for [LOC Katanga Province  ] sent a nine person commission to investigate allegations of abnormally high radiation levels at the [LOC Luiswishi Mine  ] , located approximately 20km north-west of [LOC Lubumbashi  ] , [ORG DRC  ] . 
The commission examined the mine site and surrounding mineral deposits with radiometers , and sent 100kg of rock samples to the [ORG Nuclear Research Center  ] of [ORG Kinshasa  ] ( [ORG CREN-K  ] ) for further analysis . 
The commission concluded that dangerously high levels of radiation existed at [LOC Luiswishi  ] mine , and that the mine operator , the [ORG Mining Company of South Katanga  ] ( [ORG CMSK  ] ) , which is predominantly owned by the [ORG Malta Forest Company  ] ( [ORG EGMF  ] ) , was suppressing this fact to continue mining operations. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) In early June , a named [ORG OCC  ] agent told an [MISC Embassy  ] contact that he worked as an [ORG OCC  ] overseer at the [LOC Luiswishi  ] mine for two years . 
During this time , [PER Kilolo  ] claims that he and several unidentified colleagues notified [LOC Malta Forest  ] of the high radiation levels at the mine . 
[PER Fnu Nkongolo  ] wa [LOC Dila  ] , the Director of [LOC Malta Forest  ] , reportedly paid him to keep quiet . 
[PER Kilolo  ] said that [PER Nkongolo  ] paid him and his colleagues several times after this as well. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) A named government official recently told an embassy contact that a Katangan government delegation went to [LOC Likasi  ] , [ORG DRC  ] in 2005 to investigate radiation levels at the [LOC Kisompe Mine  ] . 
The delegation reportedly detected high levels of radiation at the mine , and found artisanal diggers , who were employed by [MISC Chinese  ] and [MISC Korean  ] businessmen , working the site . 
The delegation also inspected the [MISC Copinath  ] company in [LOC Likasi  ] , and reportedly discovered that [MISC Copinath  ] had 15 tons of highly radioactive rock that it had obtained from artisanal diggers at the [ORG Shinkolobwe Uranium Mine  ] ( [ORG Shinkolobwe  ] is now closed ) . 
The delegation submitted a report suggesting that the rock be returned to [LOC Shinkolobwe  ] , but [PER Samba Kaputo  ] , the former and still de [ORG facto Special Security Advisor  ] to [ORG DRC  ] President [PER Joseph Kabila  ] , reportedly intervened and allowed the rock to be exported . 
[PER Kaputo  ] was reportedly a shareholder of [LOC Copinath.  ] ---------------------- [MISC Associated Allegations  ] ---------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) On 7 June , Econoff had lunch with Professor [PER Fortunat Lumu Badimbayi-Matu  ] , the recently dismissed Director of [ORG CREN-K  ] and the [ORG DRC  ] , s [ORG Atomic Energy Commission  ] ( [ORG CGEA  ] ) . 
During lunch , [PER Lumu  ] said that in late 2006 , the [ORG CGEA  ] sent a team , which [PER Lumu  ] lead , to [LOC Luiswishi  ] to investigate radiation [ORG KINSHASA  ] 00000797 002 OF 004 levels at the mine . 
Using [PER Geiger  ] counters , the team also found that the radiation levels were high . 
[PER Lumu  ] stated that [LOC Malta Forest  ] was mining and exporting uranium , and doing so by claiming it was copper . 
At the very least , [PER Lumu  ] said that [LOC Malta Forest  ] was selling copper at elevated prices , and foreign buyers were then separating the uranium from the raw ore. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) [PER Lumu  ] was fired shortly after this [ORG CGEA  ] investigation by the new Minister of [ORG Scientific Research  ] , [PER Sylvanus Mushi Bonane  ] . 
Minister [PER Mushi  ] fired him , in part , because he believed [PER Lumu  ] had struck personally beneficial deals with the [ORG Brinkley Mining  ] company . 
[PER Lumu  ] told Econoff that this was not true , and that he negotiated uranium mining rights with [PER Brinkley  ] on behalf of the [ORG DRC  ] government . 
He felt he was authorized to negotiate mining rights for the [ORG DRC  ] with a private foreign company to mine uranium . 
He stated that he was trying to grant [PER Brinkley  ] uranium mining rights in order to inject legitimacy and transparency into the uranium mining process . 
He admitted , however , that part of the reason [PER Brinkley  ] was going to be given the rights was because of his and the [ORG CGEA  ] , s damning report of [LOC Malta Forest  ] , and that under the [PER Brinkley  ] deal , a private company would be established to inspect and certify [PER Brinkley  ] , s uranium shipments . 
[PER Lumu  ] was going to be the president of this inspection company , and profit from it . 
He did not think that this was a conflict of interest . 
In fact , he asked Econoff what the [ORG USG  ] could do to help him , and if the [ORG USG  ] could relocate him and his family to the [LOC United States  ] because he was now afraid for his life . 
He acknowledged , however , that no [ORG DRC  ] officials , including [PER Mushi  ] , had made a specific threat against him. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) On 13 June , Econoff had lunch with [PER Lumu  ] , s replacement , Professor [PER Francois Lubala Toto  ] . 
[PER Lubala  ] does not support [PER Lumu  ] , but corroborated [PER Lumu  ] , s allegations . 
He stated that the [ORG CGEA  ] did send a team to investigate radiation levels at [LOC Luiswishi  ] , and that [LOC Malta Forest  ] is mining , exporting and selling uranium. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) On 2 June , the [MISC Embassy  ] received a copy of a grievance that 20 artisanal miners submitted to [ORG Katanga  ] Governor [PER Kutumbi  ] and the Minister of the Interior . 
In the grievance , the miners claim that that on 27 March 2007 , local government authorities in [LOC Likasi  ] , working for the Mayor of [LOC Likasi  ] , [PER Helene Yav Nguz  ] , asked the miners to clandestinely mine 200 , 60kg sacs of raw rock from [LOC Shinkolobwe  ] . 
Mayor [PER Yav  ] , who had partnered with local [MISC Chinese  ] businessmen , allegedly promised to pay the miners $20,000 for this work . 
The miners claimed that they mined the rock , but never received payment . 
They claimed that the rock was taken to the [ORG Kimpese Depot  ] near [LOC Shinkolobwe  ] , and that during the night of 3 April , it was loaded onto a red [ORG Scania  ] truck and taken from [LOC Likasi  ] . 
The truck was owned by a [MISC Somalian  ] , and had license plate ACH-7893 . 
The 20 miners signed the letter . 
( Comment: Econoff finds such claims not credible , especially since he personally inspected the [ORG Shinkolobwe Uranium  ] mine in August 2006 and found that it was abandoned , and that no evidence of industrial or artisanal mining existed . 
This allegation by the 20 miners is noted for the record , however , since we recently received another report from a separate miner in [LOC Likasi  ] alledging that Mayor [PER Yav  ] is working with unidentified [MISC Koreans  ] on mining deals . 
End Comment . 
) ------- [LOC Finland  ] ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) On 5 July , Professor [PER Lumu  ] told [PER Econoff  ] that an unidentified [MISC Finnish  ] company reported to the [ORG IAEA  ] , in accordance with the regulations of the [ORG IAEA  ] , s additional protocol for the [ORG DRC  ] , that the company imported one ton of uranium from the [ORG DRC  ] in 2006 . 
The [ORG DRC  ] , however , did not report exporting any uranium in 2006 . 
Professor [PER Lumu  ] said that [ORG IAEA  ] representatives told him this in confidence during a conference in [LOC Vienna  ] . 
Econoff contacted the [ORG IAEA  ] to confirm this , but the [ORG IAEA  ] would not comment. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) According to confidential [ORG OCC  ] statistics , only two [MISC Finnish  ] companies ( note: which may actually be the same company ) bought and imported " copper and cobalt concentrates " from [ORG DRC  ] companies in [ORG Katanga Province  ] in 2005 and 2006 . 
[ORG KINSHASA  ] 00000797 003 OF 004 These were [ORG Opolo Chemicals  ] ( who has a metal processing center in [LOC Namibia  ] ) ( [ORG Box  ] 286 , 1247 , [LOC City Road  ] , [LOC Johannesburg  ] ) and [ORG Konkola Chemicals  ] , variant [ORG Kokkola Chemicals  ] ( [ORG Box  ] 286 Fin 1247 , [LOC City Deep Road  ] , [LOC Johannesburg  ] ) . 
According to the [ORG OCC  ] , s confidential 2005 statistics for [ORG Katanga  ] ( which may be SIPDIS underreported as many companies bribe border officials to avoid paying taxes ) , the following companies exported the following minerals to unidentified buyers in [LOC Finland  ] in 2005: Company - Product - Kgs - Destination ------------------------------------- CMSK - Copper/Cobalt Concentrates - 57,705,275 - [LOC Finland  ] GTL - [PER White Alloy  ] - 8,033,434 - [LOC Finland  ] Bazano - Copper Concentrates - 582,336 - [LOC Finland  ] C - Copper/Cobalt Concentrates - 2,895 - [LOC Finland  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S ) The [ORG OCC  ] states that [ORG DRC  ] companies in [LOC Katanga  ] exported a total of 255,650,678 kg of minerals in 2005 . 
Exports to [LOC Finland  ] ( 66,323,940 ) thus accounted for 26% of all exports . 
Of interest , the declared value of GTL , s &white alloy8 exports was considerably higher than that of the copper / cobalt concentrate . 
As noted , [ORG CMSK  ] works the [LOC Luiswishi  ] mine , which the [ORG Ministry of Mines  ] recently found to contain high levels of radiation . 
GTL , the [ORG Slag Treatment Group  ] of [LOC Luiswishi  ] ( Groupement de Traitement de [MISC Terril  ] de [LOC Luiswishi  ] ; 4 Route [PER Munuma  ] , [PER Kipushi  ] ) , also appears to exploit [LOC Luiswishi  ] . 
Both Bazano and &C8 were miscellaneous one-time entries in the [ORG OCC  ] records for the year . 
Since the [ORG OCC  ] only reported one [MISC Finish  ] importer in 2005 , it is reasonable to conclude that nearly all [ORG DRC  ] mineral exports to [LOC Finland  ] in 2005 went to the [ORG Konkola  ] company in [LOC Finland  ] , and came from the CMSK and GTL companies working the [LOC Luiswishi  ] mine . 
If [PER Lumu  ] , s report about a [MISC Finnish  ] company reporting one ton of uranium imports to the [ORG IAEA  ] is true , then it is also reasonable to conclude that [ORG Konkola  ] reported this , and the uranium came from the [ORG Luiswishi Mine  ] . 
This assumption would be corroborated by the [ORG REF  ] report of high radiation levels at [LOC Luiswishi.  ] ----------- Conclusions ----------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( S ) It is unclear whether or not [LOC Malta Forest  ] and other companies in [ORG Katanga Province  ] mine and traffic uranium . 
A body of circumstantial evidence exists , but specific hard evidence does not . 
Certainly , there are extensive , probably profitable quantities of uranium in [LOC Malta Forest  ] , s mines , especially since the price of uranium ( U308 ) has increased from approximately $15 a pound in 2004 to $135 a pound in <a id='par2007' href='#par2007'>¶</a>2007 . 
It would be difficult to avoid mining this uranium while mining copper , and it would be easy to export it within raw , semi-processed rock as copper , especially if an illegal export system in an unregulated environment already existed to do so . 
The fact that the [MISC Embassy  ] has received several reports in the past two months from approximately six different sources that [LOC Malta Forest  ] is trafficking uranium , lends support to the circumstantial case against them ( Post can not confirm if any of this reporting is circular ) . 
The fact that [LOC Finland  ] may claim [ORG DRC  ] uranium imports , but the [ORG DRC  ] does not record any uranium exports , is also suspicious. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( S ) On the other hand , [LOC Malta Forest  ] is an easy target ; it is a large company that has been working in the [LOC Congo  ] since 1915 , and it has been involved in business deals with various [ORG Congolese Government  ] officials . 
Statistics are also intentionally muddied and manipulated by [ORG DRC  ] officials to push various economic and political agendas . 
Around 20 June , for example , Governor [PER Katumbi  ] called Econoff to discuss the [ORG REF Ministry of Mine  ] , s report . 
He argued that [LOC Malta Forest  ] was trafficking uranium , and tried to get the [LOC United States  ] to intervene . 
Governor [PER Katumbi  ] was reportedly a shareholder in several mining companies that compete with [LOC Malta Forest  ] , including the [ORG Mining Company of Katanga  ] ( [ORG MCK  ] ) and [ORG Anvil Mining  ] , although he told [PER Econoff  ] he divested himself of ownership in these companies . 
Professor [PER Lumu  ] , s side-story is also a case in point . 
What at first glance seems like a clear-cut case of uranium mining at [LOC Luiswishi  ] quickly loses credibility by the revelation that [PER Lumu  ] planned to use the investigation to push [LOC Malta Forest  ] aside and form a personally profitable partnership with [PER Brinkley  ] . 
Certain [ORG DRC  ] officials may have a powerful economic incentive to say that private companies like [LOC Malta Forest  ] are exporting uranium , [ORG KINSHASA  ] 00000797 004 OF 004 whether this is true or not , because this often benefits their own business interests , and it is standard practice for officials to receive bribes from companies to make the problems the officials created in the first place go away . 
The only solution to conclusively determine whether or not companies are clandestinely trafficking uranium may be to conduct an independent study by a neutral party , such as the [ORG IAEA  ] .
