) --------------------------------------------- ------------- SITUATION AT THE [MISC BRAZILIAN  ] [ORG EMBASSY  ] IN [LOC TEGUCIGALPA  ] IS GRAVE --------------------------------------------- ------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Viana  ] explained that water , electricity , and phone lines to the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Tegucigalpa  ] had been cut and the [MISC Embassy  ] was running solely on a diesel generator that was running out of fuel . 
As of 05:00 this morning the [MISC Honduran  ] police and military cleared the streets surrounding the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] of protestors . 
Seventy pro-Zelaya [MISC Honduran  ] protestors sought refuge in the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] and remain there ; [PER Viana  ] said that the protestors remain calm . 
Eight [MISC Brazilians  ] from the [ORG Embassy  ] were allowed to return home , leaving only the Charge and three other [MISC Brazilians  ] at the [ORG Embassy  ] . 
So far , the [MISC Honduran  ] security forces have not intruded on the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] , however [PER Viana  ] noted that the streets around the [ORG Embassy  ] are full of security forces and it is clear that the [MISC Honduran  ] strategy is to " asphyxiate the [ORG Embassy  ] . 
" The situation is grave , [PER Viana  ] explained , and the [MISC Brazilians  ] in the [ORG Embassy  ] and the [ORG MRE  ] are concerned that the situation will escalate . 
[PER Viana  ] said that right now an invasion is improbable but not out of the realm of possibility. --------------------------------------------- ----- [ORG GOB  ] RESPONSE AND COMMUNICATIONS WITH THEIR [ORG EMBASSY  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [ORG MRE  ] and [ORG GOB  ] are maintaining constant contact with the [MISC Brazilian  ] Charge in [LOC Honduras  ] and [LOC Zelaya  ] via cellular phones and the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] is also in contact with the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Tegucigalpa  ] , [PER Viana  ] reported . 
He recounted that [MISC Brazilian  ] President [PER Lula  ] and Foreign Minister [PER Amorim  ] both called [LOC Zelaya  ] this morning and requested that he contain his supporters and their protests to prevent confrontation with the [MISC Honduran  ] security forces . 
He also said the [MISC Brazilian  ] Ambassador in [LOC Washington  ] had contacted the [ORG State Department  ] this morning. -------------------- [ORG GOB  ] REQUESTS US HELP -------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) According to [PER Viana  ] , the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Tegucigalpa  ] has asked the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Honduras  ] for help in maintaining security at the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] and for diesel fuel to run their generator . 
[PER Viana  ] said they would be in need of food and water , but were concerned that no one would be able to reach them with fuel and other basics since the streets were controlled by the [MISC Honduran  ] security forces . 
[PER Viana  ] lamented that the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] did not have " the type of protection the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Embassy  ] has , the [MISC Marines  ] , " because they are unable to defend the [ORG Embassy  ] . 
[PER Viana  ] reiterated the message that the [ORG MRE  ] and [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] have already passed to the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Tegucigalpa  ] and [LOC Washington  ] , that the [ORG GOB  ] is concerned with the vulnerability of their [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Honduras  ] and apprehensive of what may happen. --------------------------------------------- --- COMMENT: TAKEN BY SURPRISE , [ORG GOB  ] TURNS TO THE [ORG USG  ] --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The openness and availability of [ORG MRE  ] officials today their open concern that the situation is worsening , along with [LOC Brazil  ] , s traditional reticence to take controversial positions or actions in the region , seem to confirm other reporting that that the [MISC Brazilians  ] were taken by surprise by [LOC Zelaya  ] and were unprepared to deal with the fallout . 
They clearly fear that the situation may get desperate quickly , and see the [LOC United States  ] as key to acquiring immediate help and international assistance . 
Post will continue to seek updates from [ORG MRE  ] on the situation and [ORG GOB  ] plans .
