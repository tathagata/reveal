( C/NF ) [MISC SUMMARY:  ] Following a marathon 15 hour Cabinet meeting , the [MISC Dutch  ] Cabinet fell around 02:30 a.m. , February 20 due to fundamental disagreements and [ORG Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) posturing ahead of local elections . 
Conflicts within the governing coalition have prompted several near Cabinet crises over the past several months , as the [ORG PvdA  ] butted heads with coalition partner [PER Christian Democrats  ] ( [ORG CDA  ] ) over the [ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] , decision-making during the 2003 [LOC Iraq  ] conflict , and now the commitment of military forces to [LOC Afghanistan  ] after 2010 . 
[ORG PvdA  ] has been trying to rally its base supporters by standing firm against a [LOC Netherlands  ] deployment in [LOC Uruzgan  ] after 2010 . 
With PM [PER Balkenende  ] submitting his resignation to the Queen , the most likely outcome is new elections and months with a caretaker government . 
The immediate concern for [LOC U.S.  ] interests is the future status of [MISC Dutch  ] forces in [LOC Uruzgan  ] . 
According to FM Verhagen’s staff [MISC Dutch  ] forces will withdraw from [LOC Uruzgan  ] in 2010 , but it remains to be seen what a caretaker government could do on [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Post will work to build support with the [MISC Dutch  ] government on future deployment options that will meet Verhagen’s stated goal of a “significant [MISC Dutch  ] contribution to the [ORG NATO  ] mission.” END SUMMARY <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] THE LATEST IN A STRING OF IRRITANTS FOR [MISC DUTCH  ] CABINET: Frustration among government ministers has been building for the past year ( reftel A ) . 
In April , the Cabinet almost fell over a dispute over whether to purchase the [ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] test aircraft ( reftel E ) . 
In the fall of 2009 , the governing coalition parties split over a parliamentary resolution asking the Cabinet to pull troops out of [LOC Uruzgan  ] in 2010 ( reftel D ) . 
And in January coalition members bitterly disputed the results of the [ORG “Davids Committee Report”  ] on the [MISC Dutch  ] government’s decision in 2002-2003 to give political support to the [MISC U.S.-led  ] invasion of [LOC Iraq  ] ( reftel B ) . 
Many of the disputes were prompted by public statements by members of the Cabinet characterizing internal negotiations between the parties . 
Resolution of the disputes required painstaking negotiations . 
In the JSF dispute , as well as debates over increasing the retirement age and approving the [LOC Lisbon Treaty  ] , [ORG PvdA  ] leader ( and Deputy PM ) [PER Wouter Bos  ] has been portrayed as backing down from his previous positions . 
These tensions and [MISC Bos’s  ] weak position set the stage for a showdown on [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) POSTURING OVER [LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] BROUGHT DOWN GOVERNMENT: During the past several weeks , [PER Bos  ] , motivated by perceptions of a weak defense of [ORG PvdA  ] positions , has repeatedly and categorically claimed he would stand firm on PvdA’s pledge to end the [LOC Uruzgan  ] mission in 2010 . 
He has stuck with this pledge even as major newspapers editorialized against moving [MISC Dutch  ] troops out of [LOC Uruzgan  ] and questioned the logic of his position . 
In the last two days , newspaper headlines have trumpeted the [LOC Afghanistan  ] controversy as a crisis for the government . 
However , the dispute was prompted more by [MISC Bos’s  ] electioneering than the virtues of the mission . 
For example , during an eight-hour parliamentary debate on the evening of Qduring an eight-hour parliamentary debate on the evening of February 18 , opposition parties pummeled the coalition government over contradictory statements in early February by D/PM [PER Bos  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) and FM [PER Verhagen  ] ( [ORG CDA  ] ) over whether the entire coalition had discussed and approved a request to [ORG NATO  ] for a letter on ISAF’s needs in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
( [PER Bos  ] had originally denied he had been consulted . 
) Rather than addressing the needs of [LOC Afghanistan  ] , the debate was a dissection of the coalition’s decision-making and public statements . 
Firebrand parliamentarians [PER Rita Verdonk  ] and [PER Geert Wilders  ] called [PER Bos  ] a liar . 
More moderate [PER Alexander Pechtold  ] described the proceedings as akin to watching a divorce . 
Pechtold’s description proved apt as PM [PER Balkenende  ] today announced he would give Queen [PER Beatrix  ] his resignation , which if accepted will be followed by new elections in 1-2 months ( see paragraph 5 ) . 
The coalition-member [ORG PvdA  ] insisted on the Cabinet making an immediate decision on the post-2010 [MISC Dutch  ] deployment in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
PM Balkenende’s [PER Christian Democrats  ] ( [ORG CDA  ] ) refused , insisting on more time to weigh options to assist [ORG NATO  ] allies . 
PM [PER Balkenende  ] stated , “We explored today whether trust could be restored--efforts to restore trust between the parties have failed--given the challenges facing the [LOC Netherlands  ] , what is needed is strength , not the easy way out.” <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) LIKELY OUTCOME: LONG PERIOD OF CARETAKER GOVERNMENT WITH LIMITED AUTHORITY: With the Cabinet’s announcement , the PM will submit his resignation along with that of the [ORG PvdA Ministers  ] to the Queen . 
Most likely is that the Queen accepts the resignations , and the government falls . 
The remaining coalition parties of [ORG CDA  ] and [ORG CU  ] become a minority caretaker government with limited ability to pursue action on new issues and dependent on ad hoc parliamentary majorities for each proposed law/act . 
Elections would take place in 1-2 months . 
The caretaker government continues until the next government is formed , which requires several months of negotiations after the elections . 
If the Queen refuses the resignations she could appoint an outsider to work with the existing coalition parties to reach an agreement on how to continue to govern through the next scheduled elections in May 2011. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) IMMEDIATE CONCERN FOR [LOC U.S.  ] INTERESTS -- [MISC DUTCH  ] FUTURE STATUS IN URUZGAN: FM Verhagen’s Chief of Staff [PER Marcel de Vink  ] told us earlier Friday that the [MISC Dutch  ] government will be unable to retain troops in [LOC Uruzgan  ] after 2010 . 
There’s “no way the [MISC Dutch  ] forces will stay in [LOC Uruzgan  ] . . . that door is locked” . 
Asked about whether the [LOC Netherlands  ] would provide force protection for the [LOC Uruzgan  ] PRT , [PER De Vink  ] responded that even a minimal level of troops would be hard given the [MISC Labor Party’s  ] stubborn position . 
Now , a caretaker government , even without the [ORG PvdA  ] , will find it difficult , if not impossible to do anything in [LOC Uruzgan  ] other than follow the set policy of withdrawal in 2010. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) COMMENT: With the building tensions in the Cabinet , the government’s fall had become almost certain . 
Our efforts now turn to supporting FM Verhagen’s search for a future [MISC Dutch  ] mission in [LOC Afghanistan  ] that will make a significant contribution to [ORG NATO  ] requirements . 
END COMMENT .
