( C ) [ORG Caterpillar  ] 's principal representative for [LOC Libya  ] , [PER Mohamed El Fadhel Khalil  ] , called on the Ambassador on February 16.Khalil is Managing Director of the [ORG Parenin Company  ] , a member of the [ORG Tunisia-based Amen Group of Companies  ] . 
[PER Parenin  ] is the principal representative of [ORG Caterpillar  ] ( [ORG CAT  ] ) in [LOC Libya  ] and has invested considerable resources in establishing after-market sales support and maintenance facilities in [LOC Libya  ] . 
( [ORG Note: Parenin  ] is not an exclusive representative of [ORG CAT  ] ; however , the premium [ORG CAT  ] places on after-market support , together with the fact that investments [PER Parenin  ] has made to date in constituting maintenance facilities , make it the leading representative of [ORG CAT  ] in [LOC Libya  ] . 
End note . 
) 2 . 
( C ) [PER Khalil  ] briefed the Ambassador on difficulties [ORG CAT  ] has encountered in attempting to sell and service its equipment into [LOC Libya  ] . 
In 2007 , the [ORG GOL  ] banned imports of all machines and parts for [MISC Mercedes  ] , [ORG BMW  ] and [ORG CAT  ] . 
( [ORG Note: As  ] reported reftel , credible reports at the time suggested that the [ORG GOL  ] enacted a ban on July 28 , 2007 against imports of [MISC Mercedes  ] , [ORG BMW  ] and [ORG CAT  ] vehicles and spare parts , at least in part in connection with criticism by [MISC German  ] parliamentarians of a [LOC France-Libya  ] civilian nuclear cooperation deal . 
End note . 
) [PER Khalil  ] said the ban was signed by the Director of Customs . 
( [ORG Note: Reports  ] at the time suggested the ban was issued by the office of Prime Minister-equivalent al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi . 
End note . 
) [PER Muhammad Aghil  ] , one of the wealthiest businessmen in [LOC Libya  ] and the owner of the [MISC Mercedes  ] franchise , was imprisoned for approximately six months in connection with the dispute and eventually relinquished the right to represent [MISC Mercedes  ] . 
Several well-informed business contacts have reported that [PER Aghil  ] also transferred a considerable portion of his assets ( some put the aggregate amount as high as two-thirds of his total worth ) to interests representing the al-Qadhafi family as part of the deal by which he was released from prison and permitted to engage in ( reduced ) business activities . 
[MISC Mercedes  ] was ultimately able to resume importing vehicles and equipment into [LOC Libya  ] under a new ( regime-blessed ) representative . 
3 . 
( C ) [PER Khalil  ] said a representative of the al-Qadhafi family ( he did not say who ) approached [ORG CAT  ] 's Vice President of Marketing for [LOC Europe  ] , [LOC Africa  ] and the [LOC Middle East  ] , [PER Paolo Fellin  ] , shortly after the total ban was imposed with a request that a member of the al-Qadhafi family be named as [ORG CAT  ] 's principal representative in [LOC Libya  ] . 
[ORG CAT demurred  ] . 
In July 2007 , following an appeal by [ORG CAT 's  ] local representative to [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi , the ban on imports of [ORG CAT products  ] was partially lifted , allowing equipment to be brought in by end-users only ( vice representatives/dealers ) . 
The continuing ban on imports of equipment by the [ORG CAT 's  ] principal [LOC Libya  ] representative ( equipment for showrooms , inventory and parts ) has left [ORG CAT with  ] only an 11% market share . 
Without the import restrictions , [PER Khalil  ] estimated that [ORG CAT 's  ] market share would likely be close to 25% in a market with an aggregate value of some USD 50 million per year . 
4 . 
( C ) [PER Khalil  ] said the the [ORG GOL  ] reinstated the total ban on imports of [ORG CAT equipment  ] approximately two weeks ago . 
He did not offer a reason for the reimposition of the ban . 
He requested USG support and advocacy , suggesting that the Embassy raise the issue directly with the Secretary of the General People 's [ORG Committee for Economy  ] , [ORG Trade and Investment  ] ( Minister of Economy-equivalent ) , Dr. [PER Ali Essawi  ] 5 . 
( C ) [MISC Comment: Different  ] permutations of the reasons for [ORG CAT 's  ] troubles are making the rounds in [LOC Tripoli  ] 's rumor mills . 
A version has it that both [MISC Saadi  ] al-Qadhafi ( a son of [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi ) and [ORG Khaled  ] al-Hmeidi ( son of Free Officer and senior regime figure al-Khweildi al-Hmeidi ) want to be [ORG CAT 's  ] principal representative in [LOC Libya  ] , and that [ORG CAT 's  ] difficulties reflect ( at least in part ) that struggle . 
The re-imposition of the total ban against imports of [ORG CAT 's  ] equipment coincides with negotiations to finalize a [ORG U.S.-Libya Trade and Investment Framework Agreement  ] , raising important questions about the extent to which [LOC Libya  ] can be expected to honor basic free trade principles . 
Post will coordinate with the [ORG Department , DOC  ] and USTR to develop a strategy for raising [ORG CAT 's  ] market access issues with the [ORG GOL  ] .
