<code><pre>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 04 RIYADH 000651 SIPDIS NOFORN DEPARTMENT FOR NEA/ARP ( JHARRIS ) , R ( [PER MARK DAVIDSON  ] ) , NEA/PPD ( [PER WALTER DOUGLAS  ] ) EO 12958 DECL: 10/20/2050 TAGS PGOV , PHUM , PTER , ECON KISL , SA SUBJECT: IDEOLOGICAL AND OWNERSHIP TRENDS IN THE [MISC SAUDI  ] MEDIA Classified By: CDA [PER David Rundell  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: The [MISC Saudi  ] regulatory system offers the al-Saud regime a means to manipulate the nation’s print media to promote its own agenda without exercising day-to-day oversight over journalists , and [MISC Saudi  ] journalists are free to write what they wish provided they do not criticize the ruling family or expose government corruption . 
In addition , most media in [MISC Saudi  ] Arabia--print and electronic--are owned by royal family members , and accordingly self-censorship is the order of the day . 
In comparison to a few years ago , however , the media business in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] is dynamic , fueled by increased demand by [MISC Saudi  ] and pan-Arab audiences , new licensing agreements with [LOC US  ] and other international media , and an unprecedented level of openness to outside ideas . 
2.In interviews with [ORG Embassy  ] and Consulate [LOC Jeddah  ] officers before the early December Eid holiday , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] editors and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] TV managers outlined key elements of these trends and adumbrated how the long hand of the al-Saud--motivated by profit and politics--retains a strong hold over media in this sophisticated new environment , through means ranging from refined [ORG Interior Ministry  ] procedures for recalcitrant journalists , to directives by King [PER Abdallah  ] himself to adopt progressive perspectives as an antidote to extremist thinking . 
End summary. //Family Business ? // <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG Embassy  ] press officers met recently [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
According to [LOC Shuaa Capital  ] , a [MISC Gulf-based  ] financial services firm , [ORG SRMG  ] is the largest publisher in the country , with a global readership well in excess of 180 million and an aggregate market share of 46.1%. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) According to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [PER Prince Waleed  ] bin [PER Talal  ] , he told us , now owns 35% of [LOC SMRG  ] , with “private investors” controlling the rest . 
Financial reports we acquired list [MISC Saudi  ] businessman [PER Mohammed Hussein Ali  ] al-Amoudi as owning 57.70% of [ORG SRMG  ] at the beginning of 2008 , which on paper would give him ( and others he may represent ) control of this powerful media concern. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S/NF ) It is worth noting , however , that other [MISC Saudi  ] editors we’ve spoken to always refer to the [MISC Saudi  ] [ORG Research  ] and [ORG Marketing Group  ] as being “owned” by [PER Prince Salman  ] , despite the fact that [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that he is not a shareholder and the official holdings of [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] amount to only ten percent of the company . 
When this was noted by emboff to one of our press contacts , he told us that it was well-known that [PER Prince Salman  ] owns [ORG SRMG  ] and controls its direction through his son [ORG Faisal.  ] //New Direction// <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] is representative of a trend we have noted in all media here: the increase of well-educated , relatively pro-US [MISC Saudis  ] in editorial positions . 
Technocratically-minded with a journalism degree from a [LOC US  ] university , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that the entire [ORG SRMG  ] organization has been directed to adopt a “professional , western-style approach” to the media that would both increase revenue and reinforce “modern ideas” that the SAG leadership wishes to purvey as an antidote to extremist ideology. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( SBU ) Although originally founded as an economic daily , “Al Eqtisadiah” has long been equally known for its political content , often printing editorials and opinion harshly critical of the [LOC US  ] on a number of fronts . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] recently had a three-hour discussion with one of [PER Rupert Murdoch’s  ] sons on a deal to publish an [MISC Arabic-language  ] version of the [ORG Wall Street Journal  ] , and that [ORG SRMG  ] is trying to win a contract to publish the [ORG International Herald Tribune  ] ( uncensored , he emphasized ) in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] RIYADH 00000651 002 OF 004 //The [ORG MBC Group//  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) A similar ideological and ownership pattern characterizes the hugely-successful [LOC Middle East Broadcasting  ] ( [ORG MBC  ] ) group , according to [LOC XXXXXXXXXXXX.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S/NF ) During a visit to the [LOC US Embassy  ] in November for a visa in preparation for the [ORG King’s UNGA  ] and [LOC White House  ] summit meetings , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told press officer that while [ORG MBC  ] is owned by King Fahd’s brother-in-law ( the non-royal [PER Waleed  ] bin [PER Ibrahim  ] al-Ibrahim ) , fifty percent of the profits of the [ORG MBC  ] empire go to King Fahd’s youngest son ( and al-Ibrahim’s maternal nephew ) [PER Abdulaziz  ] bin Fahd . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] on issues relating to al-Arabiya and other [ORG MBC  ] channels . 
When asked if the thirty-something prince was interested only in the profits of the station , or if he also took an active role in the ideological direction of al-Arabiya , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] whispered with a grimace , “Both.” <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S/NF ) In a meeting at his [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] office [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] with Consulate and [ORG Embassy  ] press officers , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] because of the [MISC SAG’s  ] concern that young [MISC Saudis  ] were particularly vulnerable to the calls of extremists , and that the station now targets its moderate news broadcasts to the 14-18 year old demographic in short presentations of three minutes or less . 
He also said that the stations website , [PER Arabiya Net  ] , appeals to a pan-Arab audience and gets about 100,000 visitors per day . 
[PER Al Arabiya  ] and other [ORG MBC  ] channels , he said , present programming that they hope counters the influence of al-Jazeera and fosters “moderate” perspectives among the country’s youth. //David [PER Letterman  ] , Agent of Influence// <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the [MISC American  ] programming on channels 4 and 5 were proving the most popular among [MISC Saudis  ] . 
A look at the December 17 programming menu for [ORG MBC  ] channel 4 reveals a 24-hour solid block of such programs as [ORG CBS  ] and [ORG ABC Evening News  ] , [PER David Letterman  ] , Desperate Housewives , Friends and similar fare , all uncensored and with [MISC Arabic  ] subtitles . 
Channel 5 features [LOC US  ] films of all categories , also with [MISC Arabic  ] subtitles . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that this programming is also very popular in remote , conservative corners of the country , where he said “you no longer see [MISC Bedouins  ] , but kids in western dress” who are now interested in the outside world. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Over coffee in a [LOC Jeddah  ] [MISC Starbucks  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] elaborated on the changes in the [MISC Saudi  ] media environment. “The government is pushing this new openness as a means of countering the extremists , ” [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [ORG Riyadh  ] press officer. “It’s still all about the War of Ideas here , and the [MISC American  ] programming on [ORG MBC  ] and [PER Rotana  ] is winning over ordinary [MISC Saudis  ] in a way that ‘Al Hurra’ and other [LOC US  ] propaganda never could . 
[MISC Saudis  ] are now very interested in the outside world , and everybody wants to study in the [LOC US  ] if they can . 
They are fascinated by [LOC US  ] culture in a way they never were before.” <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) So effective has [LOC US  ] programming been , said [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , that it is widely assumed that the USG must be behind it . 
Some believe , he said , that [PER Prince Talal’s  ] relationship with [PER Rupert Murdoch’s  ] [ORG News Corp  ] and its sister company [ORG Twentieth Century Fox  ] has a clear ideological motive behind it , noting that the [ORG Fox Movie Channel  ] on “Rotana” is available for free to anyone with a satellite dish . 
Both [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , liberal-minded supporters of [LOC US  ] democracy and society with little use for conspiracy theory , clearly believed this was the case. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) While revenue from commercials on [MISC Rotana’s  ] [ORG Fox Movie Channel  ] probably matter more to [PER Prince Waleed  ] than the dissemination of western ideas ( [ORG MBC  ] and [PER Rotana  ] are in a bitter battle for market share ) it is easy to understand why [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believe that this programming is having a profound effect on the values and worldviews of [MISC Saudi  ] audiences . 
During the recent [MISC Eid  ] holiday , [MISC Rotana’s  ] “Fox Movies” channel repeatedly aired two mawkish [LOC US  ] dramas ( again with [MISC Arabic  ] subtitles ) featuring respectful , supportive [MISC American  ] husbands dealing with spouses suffering from addiction problems--in one case gambling ( lost the kids’ college funds and then told her college professor husband it was because he was boring ) and the other alcohol ( smashing cars and [LOC china  ] when she [ORG RIYADH  ] 00000651 003 OF 004 wasn’t assaulting the husband and child . 
) These films and others broadcast over the [MISC Eid  ] offer models of supportive behavior in relationships , as well as exemplary illustrations of heroic honesty in the face of corruption ( “Michael [ORG Clayton”  ] ) and respect for the law over self-interest ( “Insomnia.” ) <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Saudi-produced religious programming on ART and [PER Rotana  ] also departs from past models . 
[MISC Rotana’s  ] popular religious channel “Al Risala” features a hip , clean-shaven [MISC Saudi  ] in western clothes offering practical religious advice in a calm and friendly manner . 
Jeddah-based [ORG Arab Radio and Television  ] company ( ART ) ( owned by [PER Saleh  ] al-Kamel and according to our contacts being edged aside by [ORG MBC  ] and [PER Rotana  ] ) recently featured an [MISC MTV-style  ] music video clip on its “Iqraa” religious channel depicting a group of dissolute young [MISC Saudi  ] men who give up their carousing and return to observance . 
They are then shown succeeding in sales presentations and other interactions at work , gaining the admiration of their colleagues and supervisors . 
The young men continue to dress in standard attire , remain clean-shaven and are fully integrated into normal , workaday [MISC Saudi  ] society . 
The message of moderation in the religious realm could not be clearer. //The Idol// <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The Kingdom’s chattering classes aren’t the only ones noticing the movement towards moderation and rapprochement with the outside world that is reflected in print and television media . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that religious conservatives call the [MISC Saudi  ] newspaper “Al-Watan” ( owned by Prince Khaled al-Faisal ) “Al-Wathan”--the idol . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said his network is referred to as [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , and that pan-Arab daily “Al [MISC Sharq  ] al Awsat , ” with its distinctive green-colored pages , is known as “Khadraa al Domon”--”green plant from the dung heap , ” a metaphor from one of Prophet’s hadiths warning young men of feminine corruption wrapped in meretricious allure. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Extremist elements , said all of these contacts , have been largely deprived of their public voice in the media and on television , but remain a diminished but still potent force in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
When reporting officer noted the enormous security progress that allowed him to sit outside a crowded [MISC Starbucks  ] less than two blocks away from the [LOC Jeddah  ] Consulate--something that would have been unthinkable two years earlier--XXXXXXXXXXXX shook his head. “You ( [MISC Americans  ] ) still have to be careful . 
They’re still out there , ” he said , referring to violent extremists. //Okaz// <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In a meeting with [LOC Jeddah  ] CG and [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was blunt when asked about SAG efforts in countering extremist thinking. “King [PER Abdallah  ] was here , ” he said , pointing around his well-appointed office [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] in [LOC Jeddah.  ] “He told us that conservative elements in [MISC Saudi  ] society do not understand true [MISC Islam  ] , and that people needed to be educated” on the subject . 
King [PER Abdallah  ] , he said , used a metaphor of a donkey to explain how the religious police use the wrong approach. “They take a stick and hit you with it , saying ‘Come donkey , it’s time to pray.’ How does that help people behave like good [MISC Muslims  ] ? ” [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] quoted the king as saying. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also told us that he had taken over the [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] establishment only two months ago at the direction of the Minister of [ORG Information  ] , and that one of his first orders of business was to enact dramatic cuts in the sprawling editorial division . 
It was clear by the direction of the conversation that [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , intends to make sure that the paper falls in line with the [MISC SAG’s  ] message. //The Stick// <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Although all chief editor positions in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] must [LOC RIYADH  ] 00000651 004 OF 004 be approved by the Minister of [ORG Information  ] , it is the job of the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] ( [ORG MOI  ] ) to take action against editors and writers who refuse to follow government directives and policies . 
In the past , the [ORG MOI  ] played a largely reactive role in this regard through its [ORG Supreme Information Council  ] , which would discuss questionable material and order editors to be scolded or fired , or at times ban publication of the paper for a certain period of time. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) According to our contacts , however , a more effective system is in place . 
Instead of being fired or seeing their publications shut down , editors now are fined SR 40,000 ( $10,600 ) out of their own salaries for each objectionable piece that appears in their newspaper . 
Journalists , too , are held to account . 
Instead of the [ORG Supreme Information Council  ] in [LOC Riyadh  ] taking the lead in tracking what journalists write , there are now [ORG MOI  ] committees in each [MISC Saudi  ] city that know their community well and have a keen ear for who is talking about what . 
If these [ORG MOI  ] operatives detect a problematic pattern in a journalist’s writing ( or even hear through channels that he or she is heading down a certain line of inquiry ) , they will invite the journalist for a chat , during which they will discuss the origin of these perspectives , suggest alternative approaches , ask after the family , etc. , . . 
These mechanisms , our contacts say , have been very effective in reining in media opinion that the SAG doesn’t like. //Al-Hayat and Khaled bin [PER Sultan//  ] <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) One of the exceptions to the talking-point consistency of most [MISC Saudi  ] media is pan-Arab daily “Al-Hayat , ” which is owned by Deputy Defense Minister Khaled bin [PER Sultan  ] . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX. <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) When this rather more dynamic editorial environment at “Al-Hayat” was noted to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] he told us that Khaled bin-Sultan actually does not involve himself in the workings of the paper , provided it never criticizes the royal family or SAG policy . 
[ORG Al-Hayat  ] , he explained , has more credibility in the [MISC Arab  ] world than rival [MISC Al-Sharq  ] al-Awsat , and had to be more daring than other [MISC Saudi  ] print media. “Besides , ” said [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , “information is power for the al-Saud , and owning [ORG Al-Hayat  ] gives Khaled bin [PER Sultan  ] more influence in the family.” <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Comment: In keeping with other initiatives such as the [ORG Interfaith Dialogue  ] and plans for educational reform , the SAG has clearly made a strategic decision to open the country to outside opinion , perspectives and culture to root out the vestiges of the extremist ideology and vision that threatened their rule . 
At the same time , they have refined their methods of control over editors and journalists in an effort to control the spread of these and other dissident ideas .
