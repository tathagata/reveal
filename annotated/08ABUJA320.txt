END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [LOC Kano  ] real estate entrepreneur and longtime [MISC Mission  ] contact [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [PER PolOff  ] February 10 that [LOC Katsina  ] native [PER Dahiru Mangal  ] , who [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] contends deals in illicit smuggling of goods into [LOC Nigeria  ] , is also known as President [PER Yar'Adua  ] 's " Mr. Fix It . 
" [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] alleged a close association between the President and [PER Mangal  ] , dating to the former 's tenure as governor of [LOC Katsina  ] , and claimed the latter remains to this day [PER Yar'Adua  ] 's " go-to man " to accomplish " anything filthy that [PER Yar'Adua  ] needs done . 
" [PER Mangal  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , is also the " go-to " for any wealthy [MISC Nigerian  ] , who wants to import " just about anything " into [LOC Nigeria  ] . 
He declined to state whether [PER Mangal  ] smuggled weapons , drugs , or persons into [LOC Nigeria  ] . 
( On February 17 , [PER PolOff  ] queried another [LOC Kano  ] business contact , who corroborated [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] 's accusations , however claimed [PER Mangal  ] no longer goes by " Mr. Fix It " since [PER Yar'Adua  ] officially named him a special advisor earlier this month . 
Allegedly , [PER Yar'Adua  ] instructed [PER Mangal  ] to cease any illicit activity if [PER Mangal  ] wished to enjoy official recognition by the President . 
The contact implied this may connote , inter alia , that [PER Yar'Adua  ] desires to maintain at least the appearance of respect for rule of law , and thus , does not want any of his close advisors openly involved in suspect activity . 
) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [PER PolOff  ] [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] several [MISC Nigerian  ] businessmen who have employed [PER Mangal  ] 's services over the past several years . 
Reportedly , [PER Mangal  ] owns a warehouse across the [LOC Niger  ] border ( likely close to the [LOC Katsina  ] border with [LOC Jibiyya  ] and [LOC Maradi  ] ) in which he stores hundreds of 40-foot shipping containers . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] claimed [PER Mangal  ] is able to import goods from around the world , including [LOC China  ] . 
In return , [PER Mangal  ] requests a flat fee of 2 million naira ( USD 17,000 ) , excluding the cost of goods . 
Approximately 100 containers per month are brought into [LOC Kano  ] , and goods are then delivered to clients or sold in [LOC Kano  ] 's [LOC Kurmi  ] market. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [PER Mangal  ] also operates several legitimate businesses , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] asserted , including [ORG Mangal Airlines  ] . 
The [ORG National Hajj Commission of Nigeria  ] contracted [LOC Kabo  ] , [LOC Bellview  ] , [LOC Meridian  ] , and [ORG Mangal Airlines  ] for the December 2007 hajj operations , which transported approximately 100,000 [MISC Nigerians  ] to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] for the annual pilgrimage . 
( Note: Many [MISC Nigerian  ] Muslims have criticized the [ORG GON  ] 's handling of the 2007 hajj claiming several thousand [MISC Nigerians  ] were left stranded in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] and could not return to [LOC Nigeria  ] , except without extraordinary hardship , and several others were never airlifted from [LOC Nigeria  ] at all . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) Moreover , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] had been approached recently by a man claiming to speak on behalf of [ORG First Lady  ] [PER Turai Yar'Adua  ] . 
The person , who arrived at the meeting with [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] in a [ORG Peugeot  ] with a " presidential " license plate , told [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] the [ORG First Lady  ] would " allow " them to construct the homes so long as she is given an advance payment of 250 million naira ( [MISC USD  ] 2 million ) . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he was willing to offer the [ORG First ABUJA  ] 00000320 002 OF 002 [ORG Lady  ] twenty plots of land instead , to which the presumed emissary grimaced . 
The negotiations , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [PER PolOff  ] , continue. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C//NF ) NOTE: During a late January conversation with [PER PolOff  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] purchased an [MISC USD  ] 10 million house in central [LOC London  ] approximately 7 years ago , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
This house apparently was excluded from President Yar , [LOC Adua  ] , s public declaration of assets in June 2007 , which put his total wealth at approximately USD 7 million . 
END NOTE. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) COMMENT: While [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] is a trusted , longtime [MISC Mission  ] contact who has provided veracious information in the past , we cannot independently confirm his statements regarding [PER Mangal  ] or the [ORG First Lady  ] . 
Certainly , the man who approached [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] seeking a pay-off may simply have been attempting to exploit the [ORG First Lady  ] 's name for personal enrichment . 
We have heard rumors of the emergence of a " [LOC Katsina  ] clique " in the [LOC Villa  ] -- a group of individuals from the President 's home state of [LOC Katsina  ] who reportedly constitute [PER Yar'Adua  ] 's inner circle and increasingly , control access to him . 
The surfacing of this group may be a corrollary to [PER Yar'Adua  ] 's lack of national exposure ( and hence , his deficiently broad support base ) and his inability thus far to stamp his authority on the ruling People 's [ORG Democratic Party  ] . 
Rumors abound alleging that the [ORG First Lady  ] , [ORG Special Advisor Tanimu Yakubu  ] , and Minister of Agriculture [PER Sayyadi Ruma  ] are involved in corrupt practices . 
Reports of both the [ORG First Lady  ] and [ORG Yakubu  ] 's taste for the high life and tendencies toward illicit enrichment surfaced during a December 2007 debrief by [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] outlined problems he saw in the [LOC Villa  ] and cases [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was closely watching ( [PER Ref A  ] ) . 
Several contacts from [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , moreover , maintain that while the President " appeared incorruptible " during his tenure as governor , his wife siphoned off millions in public funds for private use . 
Post will closely monitor these accusations and report any new developments . 
END COMMENT .
