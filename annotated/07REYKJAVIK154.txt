( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: [LOC Iceland  ] has not taken a final position on the cluster munitions issue , but is unwilling to support a complete ban on their use . 
However , due to regional solidarity and a desire to make disarmament a key issue in [LOC Iceland  ] 's campaign for a [ORG UN Security Council  ] seat , the [ORG GOI  ] is inclined to support [MISC Norwegian  ] efforts . 
Further engagement on the [MISC NATO-related  ] impacts of such a ban and [ORG USG  ] views on the way forward through the framework of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons ( [ORG CCW  ] ) may bear fruit in helpfully shaping the [ORG GOI  ] position . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG PolOff  ] presented reftel points on May 18 to [ORG Icelandic Ministry for Foreign Affairs  ] Ambassador for [MISC Arms Control Issues  ] [PER Petur Thorsteinsson  ] . 
Asked directly whether or not [LOC Iceland  ] favored a total ban on cluster munitions , [PER Thorsteinsson  ] said that was not currently the [ORG Icelandic Government  ] 's position . 
However , [LOC Iceland  ] is looking closely at the [MISC Norwegian  ] [ORG Government  ] 's stance on the matter , and is still studying the [LOC Lima  ] text. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG PolOff  ] pointed out to [PER Thorsteinsson  ] that a ban on cluster munitions -- the effective result of the provisions of the current draft -- would have an immediate negative impact on [ORG NATO  ] operations and other joint military activities which [LOC Iceland  ] has expressed its support for . 
[PER Thorsteinsson  ] expressed his appreciation for [ORG USG  ] views on the topic , and asked for clarification as to what process the [LOC U.S.  ] would like to see go forward in the [ORG CCW  ] . 
He added that it had been the [ORG GOI  ] 's understanding that the slow pace of [ORG CCW  ] movement on the issue was at least in part due to a [ORG USG  ] desire to see no action taken regarding cluster munitions . 
[ORG PolOff  ] replied that the [LOC U.S.  ] is prepared to see a negotiating mandate in the [ORG CCW  ] to deal with the issue , vice the current discussion mandate. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) By way of background , [PER Thorsteinsson  ] noted that [LOC Iceland  ] 's candidacy for a [ORG UN Security Council  ] seat in 2009-2010 is in part based on the idea that [LOC Iceland  ] , as a nation without a military of its own , could help drive action on disarmament and arms control . 
As such , the [ORG MFA  ] felt " obligated " to take some action on the cluster munitions issue . 
That said , he also allowed that [LOC Iceland  ] needed to take military realities into account by virtue of its [ORG NATO  ] membership , and looked forward to hearing the views of other [ORG NATO  ] allies on the topic. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: Post believes that two related dynamics are at work here . 
In the first case , as [PER Thorsteinsson  ] alluded to , [LOC Iceland  ] is looking for issues to " make its own " as part of its campaign for a [ORG UNSC  ] seat . 
Disarmament and weapons abatement mesh nicely with [LOC Iceland  ] 's record of deploying explosive ordnance disposal personnel to crisis zones , making the cluster munitions issue appealing . 
Secondly , there is the matter of [MISC Nordic  ] consonance on foreign policy issues , whereby the [ORG MFA  ] feels pressure to support initiatives by other [MISC Nordic  ] countries in the absence of overriding domestic factors . 
As [LOC Iceland  ] has no military , there are few voices within the [ORG GOI  ] that will argue for -- or be naturally inclined to agree with -- the military necessity of cluster munitions , meaning the default policy will likely be one of supporting [MISC Norwegian  ] efforts . 
In response , Post will increase our engagement with those actors more open to [MISC NATO-related  ] concerns on a cluster munitions ban . 
Additionally , [ORG Post  ] would welcome further points on the [ORG USG  ] approach to dealing with the issue in the [ORG CCW  ] .
