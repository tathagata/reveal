<code><pre>S E C R E T STATE 072112 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 07/09/2024 TAGS PARM , MTCRE , PREL , TW , YM SUBJECT: ( [ORG S  ] ) ELICITING [MISC YEMENI  ] COOPERATION FOR ARMS SMUGGLING INTERDICTION EFFORTS Classified By: Classified By: Senior Adviser [PER Stephen Mull  ] for REASONS 1.4 ( B ) , ( C ) and ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) This cable is an action request . 
Please see paragraph five . 
Ambassador Seche is authorized to orally convey information in paragraphs 7-9 in delivering this demarche ( but asked not to leave points in written form ) . 
Post may not/not provide these points in the form of a non-paper. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) OBJECTIVE: ( a ) To obtain ROYG cooperation with [ORG CENTCOM  ] efforts to interdict the smuggling of weapons into [LOC Gaza  ] , including through authorization of [ORG Unmanned Aerial Vehicle  ] ( [ORG UAV  ] ) and helicopter flights over [MISC Yemeni  ] territorial waters . 
( b ) To elicit [MISC Yemeni  ] agreement to receive an interagency delegation to discuss additional means of cooperation including on enhancement of Yemen’s own anti-smuggling capability. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Background: On January 16 , 2009 , the [ORG USG  ] signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the [ORG Government of Israel  ] on the prevention of supply of arms and related materiel to terrorist groups . 
We are working on many fronts to implement this [ORG MOU  ] , including through interdiction efforts by [LOC U.S.  ] military assets in the region . 
[ORG CENTCOM  ] has been tasked with responsibilities pertaining to military implementation of the [ORG MOU  ] within its [ORG AOR.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) We understand a significant volume of arms shipments to [ORG Hamas  ] make the short 24-hour transit across the [LOC Red Sea  ] from [LOC Yemen  ] to [LOC Sudan  ] . 
These shipments usually transit in small groups of flagged and unflagged dhows that use territorial waters , busy harbors , and mangroves to mask their routes and increase their likelihood of evading interception by [LOC U.S.  ] or other forces . 
These intentional tactics , combined with the number of and similarity among vessels , make interdiction difficult once the vessels reach international waters . 
In a recent case , sparse intelligence and a dhow’s use of [MISC Yemeni  ] territorial waters allowed a known shipment of arms probably bound for [LOC Gaza  ] to transit undetected in international waters past a searching [LOC U.S.  ] warship. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Obtaining [MISC Yemeni  ] permission to fly [ORG Unmanned Aerial Vehicles  ] ( [ORG UAVs  ] ) and helicopters over [MISC Yemeni  ] territorial waters would greatly enhance CENTCOM’s ability to gain the intelligence required to identify and track the dhows as they enter international waters and increase the probability of successful interdiction . 
Accomplishing this would not/not require sending [ORG UAVs  ] or helicopters into the airspace over Yemen’s land territory. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/REL ROYG ) Action Request:  ] To fully support DoD’s intent to disrupt and deter illicit arms smuggling , Embassy [LOC Sanaa  ] is requested to approach [ORG ROYG  ] at the highest appropriate level to request authorization for [ORG CENTCOM  ] to fly [ORG Unmanned Aerial Vehicles  ] ( [ORG UAVs  ] ) and helicopters over [MISC Yemeni  ] territorial waters in an effort to better track dhows and make successful intercepts once they reach international waters. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/REL ROYG ) Post  ] is also requested to emphasize the importance of the broader interdiction effort to the [ORG USG  ] and propose that the [ORG ROYG  ] receive an interagency delegation to discuss means to maximize bilateral cooperation in this regard , including on enhancement of Yemen’s own anti-smuggling capability. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) Our arms interdiction efforts are focused on preventing shipments intended for [LOC Gaza  ] . 
Nonetheless , Gaza-bound shipments represent only one aspect of the broader regional problem of arms smuggling from and through [LOC Yemen  ] . 
The following points discuss several recipient groups and possible destinations ( [LOC Gaza  ] , [LOC Somalia  ] ) of arms smuggled from and through [LOC Yemen  ] . 
Post may use its discretion in framing the scope of this conversation in order to maximize the prospects of a positive response . 
Post may not/not provide these points in the form of a non-paper. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/REL ROYG  ] ) Points for Oral Presentation: Arms Smuggling in [MISC Yemeni  ] [ORG Coastal Waters  ] In the past , we have had extensive discussions with your government about the ability of terrorists and other sub-state actors to acquire small arms/light weapons ( [ORG SALW  ] ) sourced from [MISC Yemeni  ] black markets and use them to conduct attacks elsewhere . 
For example , the [MISC Strela-2  ] ( SA-7 GRAIL ) manportable air defense systems ( [ORG MANPADS  ] ) used in the 2002 attacks on a civilian airliner in [LOC Kenya  ] were sourced in [LOC Yemen  ] , as were small arms used to attack the [LOC US  ] consulate in [LOC Jeddah  ] , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] in 2004 . 
We welcome the steps your government has taken over the last several years to stem the influx of weapons to the [MISC Yemeni  ] black market from external sources , to take illicit weapons off the streets , and to prevent terrorist access to lethal arms . 
However , we remain extremely concerned that arms smuggling activities originating in and/or transiting [LOC Yemen  ] are still providing a destabilizing source of weapons for the region . 
The large quantities of black market weapons still available in [LOC Yemen  ] are being exploited by regional smuggling networks to provide arms to various non-state actors , possibly including al-Qa’ida associated terrorist groups . 
( [LOC S//REL  ] TO [LOC USA  ] , [ORG YEM  ] ) We have specific information that a weapons smuggling network originating in [LOC Yemen  ] is supplying weapons to individuals in [LOC Africa  ] who are delivering them to various entities there , potentially including al-Qa’ida associated terrorist groups . 
( [LOC S//REL  ] TO [LOC USA  ] , [ORG YEM  ] ) According to recent information , an extremist associated with the al-Rashaydah tribe , [MISC Abu-Fu’ad  ] al-Dindari , agreed to negotiate a weapons purchase between representatives of al-Rashaydah tribe in [LOC Sudan  ] which is receiving weapons from [LOC Yemen  ] through this network and [MISC Somalia-based  ] al-Shabaab . 
( [LOC S//REL  ] TO [LOC USA  ] , [ORG YEM  ] ) This network also provides arms that are smuggled into the [LOC Gaza  ] Strip . 
The weapons are transported by boat across the [LOC Red Sea  ] to landing points in [LOC Sudan  ] . 
The vessels are met either on shore or a short distance off the coast . 
Once landed , we assess that the goods are transported north by car through [LOC Sudan  ] . 
( [LOC S//REL  ] TO [LOC USA  ] , [ORG YEM  ] ) We have been able to identify a number of the [MISC Yemeni  ] members of this network , including several who are affiliated with [MISC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] owns at least one boat and may operate a fleet of small fishing vessels that are used to run money and weapons across the [LOC Red Sea  ] between [LOC Yemen  ] and [LOC Sudan  ] . 
( U ) This particular network has smuggled a wide variety of weaponry out of [LOC Yemen  ] , including rockets , handguns , anti-armor rocket-propelled grenades , and anti-aircraft guns . 
( [ORG S  ] ) We have identified this network and some specific information on its activities . 
We believe , however , that other arms smuggling networks operating from and through [LOC Yemen  ] may exist . 
( U ) Yemen’s geographical location and large black market weapons stocks , not to mention , the many armed groups active in the region that are seeking additional arms supplies , make it an inviting target for arms brokers and smugglers to exploit . 
( U ) In [LOC Yemen  ] and elsewhere in the region , small , privately-owned boats that can be diverted from legitimate commercial trade for smuggling purposes are widely available . 
The availability of these means of transport makes maritime counter-smuggling operations a potentially key element of any effort to stem this flow of weapons . 
( U ) Such boats can easily transit the [LOC Red Sea  ] and [LOC Arabian Gulf  ] using the territorial waters of coastal states , including [LOC Yemen  ] , in order to minimize the risks of interception in international waters . 
The large numbers of such boats that sail these waters adds to the challenges in identifying specific vessels engaged in illicit smuggling activities . 
( [LOC S//REL  ] TO [LOC USA  ] , [ORG YEM  ] ) We have , for example , identified [LOC Shaqra  ] , [LOC Balhar  ] , [LOC Al-Mukalla  ] , Ras al-Sharmah , and [MISC Al-Ghayda  ] on Yemen’s south coast as possibly key smuggling havens or transit areas for weapons intended for [LOC Somalia  ] and possibly elsewhere .
