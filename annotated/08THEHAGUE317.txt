STATE 31941 Classified By: CDA [PER Michael Gallagher  ] , reasons 1.4 ( b , d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Polmiloff discussed reftel O with [ORG MFA Senior Advisor for Nuclear Affairs and Nonproliferation Ceta Noland  ] on April 2 , stressing the past involvement of [ORG Aviation Services International  ] ( [ORG ASI  ] ) with the [ORG Ghoods Aviation Center  ] ( reftels [MISC A-K  ] ) , and [ORG ASI  ] 's referral to [ORG Inter Connection Technologies  ] ( [ORG InCo Tech  ] ) to ship connectors used in aviation applications to [LOC Iran  ] ( reftels [MISC L-N  ] ) . 
[PER Noland  ] appreciated the additional points , but noted that the assessment by [MISC Dutch  ] authorities indicated the connectors were not/not high-density military grade. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Noland  ] said [MISC Dutch  ] customs authorities had pulled the connectors out of the crates , and that [MISC Dutch  ] authorities had determined the connectors could not be used for UAV purposes . 
She added that the [ORG GONL  ] has placed red flags on any shipment associated with [ORG ASI  ] , [ORG InCo Tech  ] , or [LOC Iran  ] 's [ORG Ghoods Aviation Center  ] -- if there is an even remote chance that a shipment could be used for UAV purposes , then the [MISC Dutch  ] will issue a catch-all , [PER Noland  ] explained . 
But in this instance , she added , the [MISC Dutch  ] were reasonably confident that the connectors could not be used for UAV purposes. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) While she has not yet received a confirmation , [PER Noland  ] strongly suspected that the shipment had gone forward . 
She said she would pass these additional points to the relevant [MISC Dutch  ] intelligence authorities , but suggested we share our information indicating the connectors are high-density military grade with the [MISC Dutch  ] through the appropriate intelligence channels . 
Comment ------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Embassy country team agrees that release of any information regarding the high-density military grade connectors through the appropriate intelligence channels would be useful in making our case with the [MISC Dutch  ] . 
End comment .
