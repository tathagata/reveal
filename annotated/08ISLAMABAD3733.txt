We have no/no indications it has moved any troops to the [MISC Indian  ] border. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) We received a readout from the [LOC UK  ] Embassy on their meetings/calls over the weekend . 
High Commissioner [PER Brinkley  ] and [LOC UK  ] COS met President [PER Zardari  ] on Sunday , November 30 ; during the meeting FM [PER Miliband  ] called [PER Zardari  ] . 
[LOC UK  ] passed the same [PER Lashkar-e-Taiba  ] ( LeT ) info to [PER Zardari  ] that they previously had passed to [ORG ISI.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG Zardari’s  ] response was positive ; he said [ORG ISI  ] had to follow up and this was an opportunity . 
He criticized the [MISC Indians  ] for statements that pushed [LOC Islamabad  ] to make a defensive response and “made my job harder.” [PER Zardari  ] said he thought it was not possible that terrorists could have launched attack boats from [LOC Karachi  ] and the operation could not have been implemented without insider help from [ORG Indians.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) In the conversation with [PER Miliband  ] , [PER Zardari  ] said he saw the attacks as an “opportunity to strike at my enemies.” The attack , he said , was aimed as much at [LOC Pakistan  ] as at [LOC India  ] , but [LOC India  ] had reacted in an unfortunate way . 
[PER Miliband  ] said that public messaging would be particularly important to link the [LOC Mumbai  ] atrocity with [ORG Zardari’s  ] own campaign against militants. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Zardari  ] told [PER Miliband  ] that “my people” had not brought specific information to him about the individuals named in the information passed to [ORG ISI  ] ( on the day before ) . 
[PER Miliband  ] said that LeT needed to “feel the full force of the law.” [PER Zardari  ] responded by saying he was setting up special courts , was contacting all political parties , and would take action ( nfi ) immediately. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Miliband  ] described [ORG ISI  ] MG [PER Pasha  ] as a welcome “new broom” and expressed [LOC UK  ] support for [ORG ISI  ] reform . 
[PER Zardari  ] said the new [ORG ISI  ] leaders were “straightforward” and their roles were proscribed by the constitution , but it would take time for real conversions . 
[PER Brinkley  ] and [PER Miliband  ] pressed for [LOC ISLAMABAD  ] 00003733 002 OF 002 [PER Pasha  ] to go to [LOC India  ] . 
[PER Zardari  ] gave [PER Brinkley  ] a long answer about various levels of directors in [ORG ISI  ] but finally confirmed that the [ORG Army  ] had vetoed the decision to send [PER Pasha  ] . 
[PER Zardari  ] told [PER Miliband  ] that it might be possible to send [ORG NSA  ] [PER Durrani  ] , as he outranked [PER Pasha  ] . 
It would not be possible , said [PER Zardari  ] , to send [PER Pasha  ] immediately as [PER Zardari  ] needed to work public opinion first. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Zardari  ] commented that he had a gut reaction that the attacks were the beginning rather than the end and went on to talk about [MISC Muslim-Hindu  ] differences and attempts to split [LOC India  ] . 
He urged the [LOC UK  ] to push back on [LOC New Delhi  ] and calm the situation . 
[PER Miliband  ] said they would do so , but [LOC India  ] needs to see real action from [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[LOC India  ] was asking for short-term actions , and this could buy some time for the [MISC GOP.  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Miliband  ] later called FM [PER Qureshi  ] and said the [LOC UK  ] would be sure he saw the intelligence passed to [ORG ISI  ] . 
He pressed that [LOC India  ] needs actions not words from [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[PER Qureshi  ] said he would follow up on the intelligence but reiterated the [MISC GOP  ] request for the [LOC UK  ] to counsel restrain on the part of the [ORG Indians.  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) High Commissioner [PER Brinkley  ] also called on [MISC Chinese  ] Ambassador to [LOC Islamabad  ] [PER Hui  ] over the weekend . 
[PER Zardari  ] had called [PER Hui  ] , and [PER Hui  ] said he had met with [PER Kayani  ] but did not share much in the way of information gleaned from the meeting . 
[PER Hui  ] was cagey on how much or what kind of assistance [LOC China  ] has provided to help with [MISC Pakistan’s  ] economic crisis . 
On the Friends of [LOC Pakistan  ] , [PER Hui  ] expressed continuing skepticism that the group did not have a clear enough mandate , is not focused , and will turn into a “talk shop.” [PER Hui  ] was noncommittal when [PER Brinkley  ] raised concern about China’s reported decision to assist [LOC Pakistan  ] build two additional civilian nuclear reactors ( [ORG Chasma II  ] and III ) . <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) See septel for special media reaction . 
Overall , the [MISC Pakistani  ] public remains in denial about any culpability for the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks and believes [LOC India  ] is unfairly and prematurely accusing [LOC Pakistan  ] .
