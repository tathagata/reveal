END SUMMARY . 
" [PER JOAN  ] OF ARC OF [LOC SUBVERSION  ] " BECOMES CHIEF OF STAFF --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On July 21 , President [PER Lula  ] named [ORG Mines & Energy  ] Minister [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] , 57 , as his new Chief of [MISC Staff  ] ( " Minister-Chief of the [MISC Civilian Household  ] " ) . 
She replaces [PER Jose Dirceu  ] , who stepped down last week because of an ongoing corruption scandal ( reftel ) . 
[PER Dirceu  ] was deeply involved in all the administration 's political strategies , but [PER Rousseff  ] announced at her swearing-in ceremony that she intends to focus more on moving the administration 's policy agenda forward . 
She noted that --contrary to press assessments-- this does not mean she is a technocrat . 
" This is not a technical job , but a political one " , she announced , " Political in the best sense of the word . 
I am no longer an executor ( at the [ORG Ministry of Mines and Energy  ] ) but a facilitator of the projects of my cabinet colleagues . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Dilma Vana  ] [PER Rousseff Linhares  ] was born 14 December 1947 in the state of [LOC Minas Gerais  ] . 
Her father was a [MISC Bulgarian  ] attorney who had naturalized [MISC Brazilian  ] citizenship . 
She became actively involved in opposition to the military dictatorship in 1967 , at age 19 , while studying economics in [LOC Minas Gerais  ] . 
Joining various underground groups , she organized three bank robberies and then co-founded the guerilla group " Armed Revolutionary Vanguard of [LOC Palmares  ] " . 
In 1969 , she planned a legendary robbery popularized as the " Theft of [PER Adhemar  ] 's Safe " . 
The operation broke into the [LOC Rio  ] apartment of the lover of former-Sao Paulo Governor [PER Adhemar de Barros  ] , netting [MISC US$2.5  ] million that [PER Adhemar  ] had stashed there . 
[PER Rousseff  ] separated from her first husband , [PER Claudio Linhares  ] , who in January 1970 hijacked a plane to [LOC Cuba  ] and remained there . 
That same month , she was captured by the regime and jailed for over three years ( the prosecutor called her " the [MISC Joan of Arc  ] of [MISC Subversion  ] " ) , including 22 days of brutal electro-shock torture. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Freed in late 1973 , [PER Rousseff  ] moved to the southern state of [LOC Rio Grande  ] do Sul . 
When her rights were restored by the 1979 general amnesty , she joined the [MISC PDT  ] party of leftist leader [PER Leonel Brizola  ] , serving in various city and state positions: Secretary of Finance of the city of [LOC Porto Alegre  ] ( 1986-1988 ) ; President of the [ORG Economy and Statistics Foundation  ] of the state of [LOC Rio Grande  ] do Sul ( 1991-1993 ) ; State Secretary of Energy , [ORG Mines and Communications  ] ( 1993-1994 ) . 
She served again as State Secretary of [ORG Mines  ] under [ORG Workers' Party  ] ( [ORG PT  ] ) Governor [PER Olivio Dutra  ] ( 1999-2002 ) , and switched to the [ORG PT  ] in 2001 . 
She was a key member of [PER Lula  ] 's transition team in the weeks before he took office in January 2003 , and [PER Lula  ] named her Minister of [ORG Mines & Energy  ] days after his inauguration. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Rousseff  ] has a Masters degree in economic theory from the [ORG University of Campinas  ] and an uncompleted doctorate in economics . 
In 1992 , she participated in an International Visitor program in the [LOC US  ] . 
She is now separated from her second husband ( who was also an opposition militant ) . 
She has a daughter , [PER Paula  ] , in [LOC Porto Alegre  ] , where she spends her weekends . 
She enjoys movies and classical music . 
She has lost weight recently , reportedly after adopting President [PER Lula  ] 's diet . 
NO-NONSENSE STYLE ----------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) With her technical background and no-nonsense style , [PER Rousseff  ] has earned grudging respect from the energy sector . 
While [LOC U.S.  ] companies were initially wary when she was appointed Energy Minister , they now admit that she has done a competent job . 
In particular , they praise her for her willingness to listen and respond to their views , even when she is inclined to a different conclusion . 
She has a reputation as being stubborn , a tough negotiator , and detail-oriented . 
Adjectives used here by those who know her include " demanding " and " workaholic " . 
Her greatest accomplishment as Minister has been the development of [LOC Brazil  ] 's new " [ORG Electricity Sector Model  ] " , which seeks to reduce consumer prices by establishing long-term supply contracts between generators and distributors . 
Other programs developed during her tenure include " Lights for Everyone " and a focus on biodiesel development . 
Unlike [PER Jose Dirceu  ] , [PER Rousseff  ] never held elective office and her contacts in [ORG Congress  ] are limited , which suggests the administration 's political coordination will be handled by others . 
The press notes that [PER Lula  ] hopes she will produce a " management shock " within the administration , which --because of managerial inefficiencies , bureaucratic gridlock , and most recently because of the raft of corruption scandals-- finds its agenda treading water. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Some in [ORG Congress  ] complain that [PER Rousseff  ] does not understand party politics . 
In April , the [ORG Senate  ] rejected her nominee to head the national oil agency in retaliation for her opposition to a nominee from the allied [ORG PMDB  ] party to head a subsidiary of [ORG Eletrobras  ] , the state-owned electricity company . 
( [PER Rousseff  ] instead opted to give the position to [PER Adhemar Palocci  ] , brother of [PER FinMin Antonio Palocci  ] . 
) Her senior advisors tell us that she sometimes disregards hierarchy , directly tasking technical employees , bypassing their supervisors . 
In addition , they note , her event horizon at the [ORG Ministry has  ] been no more than two to three weeks in the future , thus making long ( or even medium ) term planning difficult . 
COMMENT: MAKING ROOM FOR THE [ORG PMDB  ] --------------------------------- 8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The large allied [ORG PMDB  ] party is likely to get a higher profile in the [PER Lula  ] administration as the cabinet shuffle continues to unfold in the coming days . 
One rumor has [PER Rousseff  ] being replaced at [ORG Mines & Energy  ] by [PER Silas Rondeau  ] , currently the president of [ORG Eletrobras  ] , whose political sponsor is influential [ORG PMDB  ] Senator [PER Jose Sarney  ] . 
As for [PER Lula  ] 's office , with [PER Rousseff  ] as Chief of Staff , it is unclear what will happen with the separate cabinet-level position of Political Coordinator . 
The incumbent , [PER Aldo Rebelo  ] , has not been successful in pushing the administration 's agenda in [ORG Congress  ] or unifying the fractious coalition . 
He is expected to step down and return to his congressional seat . 
Thus , [PER Lula  ] may either replace [PER Rebelo  ] or fold his duties into another office , such as that of [LOC Economic  ] and [ORG Social Development  ] Secretary [PER Jaques Wagner  ] .
