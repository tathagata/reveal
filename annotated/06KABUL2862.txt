( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY . 
The new police chiefs in [LOC Kunduz  ] , [LOC Baghlan  ] and [LOC Takhar  ] are well-educated , professional , career police officers who have risen through the ranks over the past 20 to 25 years , assiduously avoiding direct participation in partisan politics and earning a reputation for loyalty and integrity . 
This stands in stark contrast to the former mujahideen commanders they are replacing , who had no formal police training or experience before being appointed as police chiefs and who have abused their positions of authority to engage in a broad range of criminal activity . 
While there are great hopes for these new chiefs , some question whether they will have the power and local support necessary to be effective . 
There is also a concern that given their low salaries , the pervasive culture of corruption , and pressure from local warlords , it may only be a matter of time before they fall to the same temptations as their predecessors . 
END SUMMARY . 
WATERSHED APPOINTMENTS ------------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The new police chiefs in [LOC Kunduz  ] , [LOC Baghlan  ] and [LOC Takhar  ] , appointed earlier this month as part of the ongoing pay and rank reform in the [ORG Afghan National Police  ] , could not be more different from the old-guard , former mujahideen commanders they are replacing . 
The new chiefs -- [ORG Sayed Ahmad  ] [PER Sameh  ] in [LOC Kunduz  ] , [PER Mohammad Ewaz  ] in [LOC Baghlan  ] and [PER Mujtaba Patang  ] in [LOC Takhar  ] -- are well-educated , professional , career police officers , all of whom got their start during the [MISC Soviet-backed  ] Karmal regime of the early 1980s . 
[PER Sameh  ] , [PER Ewaz  ] and [PER Patang  ] have slowly risen through the ranks over the past 20 to 25 years , assiduously avoiding direct participation in partisan politics and earning a reputation for loyalty and integrity . 
None of them fought in the jihad against the [MISC Soviets  ] or the [ORG Taliban  ] , but chose instead to keep their heads down and to work faithfully as police officers under whatever government existed at the time. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) This , of course , stands in stark contrast to the career path of their predecessors , [PER Mutalib Beg  ] ( mostly recently police chief in [LOC Kunduz  ] and before that , in [LOC Takhar  ] ) and [PER Mir Alam  ] ( police chief in [LOC Baghlan  ] ) . 
Both were major mujahideen commanders who had little higher education and no formal police training or experience before being appointed as police chiefs . 
[PER Mir Alam  ] had been commander of the 54th [ORG AMF Division  ] in [LOC Kunduz  ] , while [PER Mutalib Beg  ] was a [MISC Takhar-based  ] commander closely associated with his [MISC Uzbek  ] compatriot General [PER Dostum  ] . 
But even after their appointments as police chiefs , both continued to act as mujahideen commanders rather than professional police officers , abusing their positions of authority to engage in a broad range of criminal activity , including extortion , bribery and drug trafficking . 
Their removal from power constitutes a major step forward in establishing rule of law in the northeast . 
OUT OF A JOB , BUT NOT OUT OF POWER --------------------------------------------- ------- [LOC KABUL  ] 00002862 002.2 OF 005 ----- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) One potential problem , however , is that while they are no longer police chiefs , they both still exercise significant power and influence in the region , and could frustrate the efforts of their successors to establish law and order . 
[PER Alam  ] , who has serious health problems , has moved back to [LOC Kunduz  ] with no apparent immediate plans for the future . 
Already a wealthy man , [PER Alam  ] may ultimately choose to retire rather seeking another government position . 
On the other hand , [PER Beg  ] , who was escorted to his native [LOC Taloqan  ] by a 100-car convoy after his June 6 replacement as police chief , clearly has ambitions for higher office . 
He claims he was already offered the governorship of [LOC Faryab  ] province , but rejected it because it was too far away and he was not sure he would have the necessary public support there . 
He is clearly aiming for a governorship much closer to home . 
Of course , it would completely undermine the positive effect of having new , professional police chiefs in [LOC Kunduz  ] and [LOC Takhar  ] if [PER Beg  ] got his wish and was appointed to be governor of one of these two provinces. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) The following biographic information comes from extensive meetings that [PER PRToff  ] has had with the three police chiefs over the past two weeks . 
[PER MOHAMMED EWAZ:  ] NEW CHIEF IN [LOC BAGHLAN  ] --------------------------------------------- ------- ------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Mohammed Ewaz  ] , 51 , has spent the last two years serving as the commander of the [ORG Northeast Police Regional Training Center  ] ( [ORG RTC  ] ) in [LOC Kunduz  ] . 
His [MISC American  ] mentors at the [ORG RTC  ] give him rave reviews for his leadership skills and integrity . 
[PER Ewaz  ] , an ethnic [MISC Tajik  ] , was born and spent his formative years in [LOC Badakhshan  ] , but attended high school in [LOC Kabul  ] . 
He went on to study [MISC Afghan  ] culture at [ORG Kabul University  ] , eventually graduating with a diploma . 
He then worked as a high school teacher in [LOC Kabul  ] for two years before deciding to pursue a career in law enforcement . 
He attended the police academy in [LOC Kabul  ] for one year and was then assigned to [LOC Takhar  ] police force , where he served in a variety of positions over a 20-year period , including battalion commander in [LOC Khwaja Ghar District  ] along the border with [LOC Tajikistan  ] ; head of the information and culture section ; chief of police in [LOC Rustaq District  ] ; chief of provincial police operations ; chief of the political section ; manager of personnel ; and head of administration . 
His final position in the [LOC Takhar  ] police department before moving to the [LOC Kunduz  ] [ORG RTC  ] was head of the criminal investigation section. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Ewaz  ] has had to endure a couple of short disruptions to his career as a police officer . 
When [PER Najibullah  ] was overthrown in 1992 and the mujahideen took over , [PER Ewaz  ] was jobless for a year until he could win the trust of the new government and get back into the [LOC Takhar  ] police department . 
[LOC KABUL  ] 00002862 003.2 OF 005 Similarly , [PER Ewaz  ] found himself out of work when the [ORG Taliban  ] briefly took control of [LOC Taloqan  ] from the mujahideen in the late 1990 's . 
When asked whether he had ever taken up arms against the [MISC Soviets  ] or the [ORG Taliban  ] , [PER Ewaz  ] protested that he could never have been a jihadist because he was an educated man. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Ewaz  ] had only been in his job for a week when he met [PER PRToff  ] , but already by that time , he had begun to end some of the more notorious corrupt practices of the [LOC Baghlan  ] police . 
[PER Ewaz  ] noted , for example , that he had order police to stop collecting bribes at the three entrances into [LOC Puli Khumri  ] . 
He admitted that this action had not been popular with police soldiers , who had been receiving a cut of the proceeds to augment their paltry salaries , but said it was necessary to win the trust and confidence of the local population . 
SAYED AHMAD SAMEH: NEW CHIEF IN [LOC KUNDUZ  ] --------------------------------------------- ------- ----------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Sayed Ahmad Sameh  ] , 50 , was born and raised in [LOC Samangan  ] province . 
He studied electrical engineering at [ORG Kabul Polytechnic University  ] for two years in the early 1980 's , but had to give up his studies early and return to [LOC Samangan  ] in order to work to support his family . 
He spent three years as teacher and clerk before first becoming a police soldier and then a year later , a police officer in [LOC Samangan  ] . 
He worked in a variety of positions in the [LOC Samangan  ] police department over the next 10 years , eventually rising to chief of police. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Sameh  ] , an ethnic [MISC Uzbek  ] , spent the [ORG Taliban  ] period in [LOC Uzbekistan  ] , but returned in late 2001 when the [ORG Northern Alliance  ] liberated [LOC Samangan  ] , and at the request of the provincial elders , re-assumed his position as chief of police . 
He was transferred to [ORG Sar-e-Pol  ] in 2003 , but he only stayed there only six months before returning to be the chief of police in [LOC Samangan  ] . 
[PER Sameh  ] blamed his short tenure in [LOC Sar-e- Pol  ] on the difficult security environment engendered by the lack of progress on [MISC Demobilization  ] , Disarmament and Reintegration ( [ORG DDR  ] ) of former military members . 
[PER Sameh  ] was replaced as chief of police in [LOC Samangan  ] in 2004 while he was in [LOC India  ] receiving medical treatment for a heart ailment . 
He was essentially jobless from then until his appointment as the new chief of police for [LOC Kunduz  ] . 
[PER Sameh  ] was not a jihadist , and while he knows General [PER Dostum  ] ( and vice versa ) , he claims that the two are not political associates. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Like [PER Ewaz  ] , [PER Sameh  ] has already moved to cut down on police corruption in the [LOC Kunduz  ] police department , especially regarding the issuance of passports . 
Until now , a passport could take months to obtain unless one paid a $200 bribe . 
[PER Sameh  ] said he would like to fire some clearly unqualified and corrupt police officers , but has been told by [ORG MOI  ] not to bother replacing anyone until after the next round of pay and rank reform is announced , which [LOC KABUL  ] 00002862 004.2 OF 005 should automatically remove many of these people . 
[PER MUJTABA PATANG:  ] NEW CHIEF IN [LOC TAKHAR  ] --------------------------------------------- ------- ---------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Mujtaba Patang  ] , 42 , calls [ORG Logar  ] home , but he was born and raised in [LOC Kabul  ] , where his father worked as civil servant in the [ORG Ministry of Commerce  ] . 
[PER Patang  ] , an ethnic [PER Pashtun  ] , got an early start on his law enforcement career , graduating from the police academy in [LOC Kabul  ] when he was only 18 ( the youngest in his year group ) . 
He worked several years in [LOC Mazar-e-Sharif  ] , eventually rising to become a police battalion commander , before he was assigned to [LOC Kabul  ] and the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] ( [ORG MOI  ] ) , where he has spent the bulk of his career . 
His assignments at [ORG MOI  ] have included stints as commander of a 1,200-man police brigade and head of police training . 
Most recently , he was the director of liaison relations with [ORG Coalition and ISAF PRTs  ] , responsible for supervising embedded [ORG MOI  ] reps throughout the country . 
He was also a part-time professor at the police academy in [LOC Kabul  ] , teaching two or three hours per day. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) After the fall of [PER Najibullah  ] and the takeover by the mujahideen , [PER Patang  ] had to accept a lower rank than before , but he was able to continue working as a police officer . 
However , during three years of the [ORG Taliban  ] period , he did not have a position . 
Like [PER Ewaz  ] and [PER Sameh  ] , he never fought as a jihadist. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In his first 10 days in office as police chief in [LOC Takhar  ] , [PER Patang  ] has replaced key officers in the criminal investigation section , which is the most prone to bribery , and has asked local dignitaries from around the province to report to him any district police chiefs who are corrupt and/or engaged in illegal activities . 
He has moved to improve service to the public by extending the opening hours of the police HQ ( before it was open only in the mornings ) and by carrying out night police patrols throughout [LOC Taloqan  ] and the surrounding area . 
He has set up complaint boxes around the city and says that he will open the boxes and read the complaints himself . 
FLAWED POLICE REFORM -------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While all three police chiefs see their own appointments as evidence that police reform is progressing ( I did not pay anyone to get this position , [PER Ewaz  ] said proudly ) , they are nonetheless critical of the list of 86 police generals approved by [PER Karzai  ] . 
[PER Sameh  ] estimated that about 35 percent of the officers on the list did not deserve their appointments . 
[PER Patang  ] agreed that the number of unqualified officers on the list was far higher than the 13 highlighted by some in the international community . 
An ethnic [PER Pashtun  ] , [PER Patang  ] complained that he had scored high enough on his police exam to [LOC KABUL  ] 00002862 005.2 OF 005 be a three-star general , but had been bumped down to a one-star position because of a perceived need to maintain ethnic balance and to keep certain former mujahideen commanders in place , notwithstanding their lack of qualifications . 
He said that the general officer selections should have been based solely on merit , without any consideration of ethnicity . 
( Embassy comment: Although the Selection Board process for senior police officers has in fact been transparent and merit-based ( with the exception of the 13 mentioned above ) , [PER Ewaz  ] 's skepticism reflects a broad public distrust of the central government 's announced plans for civil service reform . 
It also plays into an abiding suspicion of ethnic bias , something that is deeply felt by members of all major ethnic communities . 
End embassy comment . 
) <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Patang  ] was clearly disappointed to have landed the [LOC Takhar  ] job , which he viewed as a demotion after his last position in the [ORG MOI  ] , where he supervised 16 other general officers . 
He was hoping to be assigned as the chief of the border guards ( a three-star position ) , the chief of the education section at [ORG MOI  ] ( a two-star position ) or as the chief of police in [LOC Mazar-e-Sharif  ] ( a province he already knows well from his early career ) . 
The day before the official announcement , [PER Patang  ] said he was told he would be the chief of police in [LOC Kunduz  ] , but for some still-mysterious reason , his assignment was changed overnight to [LOC Takhar  ] . 
COMMENT: CAUTIOUS HOPES ----------------------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) There are great hopes that these three new chiefs of police , who are bringing a wealth of education and experience to their positions , will prove far more competent and less corrupt than the old guard they are replacing . 
But the question remains whether these new chiefs , who are unfamiliar with the provinces to which they have been assigned , will have the power and local support necessary to be effective . 
There is also a concern that given their low salaries , the pervasive culture of corruption , and pressure from local warlords , it may only be a matter of time before they fall to the same temptations as their predecessors . 
The international community needs to actively support them so that they can be a force for fundamental change in their respective provinces .
