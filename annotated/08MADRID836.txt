( C ) Summary: Treasury Under Secretary [PER Stuart A. Levey  ] , accompanied by Chief of Staff [PER Christy Clark  ] and [ORG Policy Advisor DeAnna Fernandez  ] , traveled to [LOC Madrid  ] , [LOC Spain  ] July 15-17 , 2008 to press for [MISC Spanish  ] support for implementation of [ORG UNSCR  ] 1803 per the [ORG EU-3  ] 1 proposal and to provide information on the [MISC Iranian  ] shipping line [ORG IRISL  ] and on threats to the insurance industry .

The Under Secretary , together with Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] , thanked a [ORG Repsol  ] representative for the company decision not to pursue the [MISC South Pars Block 13  ] gas deal .

End Summary --------------------------------------------- ----- UNDER SECRETARY LEVEY'S MESSAGE WITH GOS OFFICIALS --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The Under Secretary stressed in all of his meetings the [ORG USG  ] 's commitment to a diplomatic solution to the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear issue , underscored by the decision to send Under Secretary [PER Burns  ] to participate in the [LOC Geneva  ] meeting with [LOC Iran  ] as one more indication of the [ORG USG  ] 's firm commitment to reach a diplomatic solution . 
In order to facilitate that solution , it was necessary to present [LOC Iran  ] with a " stark " choice , either conform to [ORG UNSCR  ] resolutions or face isolation and stronger economic sanctions . 
[PER Levey  ] emphasized that the [ORG EU  ] 's decision in June to designate [ORG Bank Melli  ] was a strong action that sent an important signal that the [ORG EU  ] was prepared to be firmer with [LOC Iran  ] . 
This was why it was so necessary for [LOC Spain  ] to support implementation of [ORG UNSCR  ] 1803 per the [ORG EU-3  ] 1 proposal prior to the August vacation . 
The Under Secretary also provided information on the [MISC Iranian  ] shipping line , [ORG IRISL  ] . 
He said that in 2007 , [ORG IRISL  ] ships had been interdicted , and that in several instances , the ships had been carrying prohibited items to [LOC Iran  ] . 
[ORG IRISL  ] had also engaged in deceptive practices involving , among other things , the falsification of shipping documents and operating through a company called [ORG Seibow Limited  ] . 
Additionally , [PER Levey  ] noted that [ORG UNSCR  ] 1737 requires measures to prevent the provision of financial services related to the transfer of prohibited items to [LOC Iran  ] . 
There had been a great deal of success in convincing the banking sector to be extremely vigilant in dealing with [LOC Iran  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] now wants to expand vigilance to the insurance industry as well . 
The Under Secretary also raised questions regarding the possible collaboration between [LOC Iran  ] and a [MISC Libyan-owned  ] bank. ----------------------------------- MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS MEETING ----------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The Under Secretary met with [ORG International Economic Relations and Energy Affairs  ] Director General [PER Rafael Conde de Saro  ] and two staff members . 
The [ORG MFA  ] officials said that [LOC Spain  ] has no " substantive " problems with the [ORG EU-3  ] 1 [ORG UNSCR  ] 1803 implementation proposal , but it was not clear whether [LOC Spain  ] would support implementation of the proposal prior to the August holidays . 
The [ORG MFA  ] officials added that perhaps other [ORG EU  ] members might have problems with the substance and/or timing . 
[PER Levey  ] indicated that there was a very clear reduction of [MISC Iranian  ] activity in [LOC Spain  ] deriving from various sanctions adopted at different levels . 
[LOC Spain  ] had been scrupulous in its application of sanctions . 
[PER De Saro  ] and his staff received the Under Secretary 's information on [ORG IRISL  ] and insurance with interest . 
[PER Conde  ] indicated that he was not aware of any [MISC Spanish  ] operations with [ORG IRISL  ] or of [MISC Spanish  ] insurance for [ORG IRISL  ] , but that the appropriate [MISC Spanish  ] authorities would be informed. --------------------------------- MINISTRY OF INDUSTRY , [ORG TOURISM  ] AND TRADE MEETING --------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER U/S Levey  ] met with [ORG Ministry of Industry  ] , Tourism and Trade Secretary General for Foreign Trade [PER Alfredo Bonet  ] and staff . 
[PER Bonet  ] expressed support for vigilance and caution with respect to transactions with [LOC Iran  ] . 
He said that [ORG Repsol  ] had made a " tough decision " not to pursue the [MISC South Pars MADRID  ] 00000836 002 OF 003 deal . 
With respect to export credits , a staff member said that [LOC Spain  ] was " freezing " export credit levels to [LOC Iran  ] . 
Responding to [PER U/S Levey'  ] questions regarding what a " freeze " means , the official said that it meant capping export credit levels to [LOC Iran  ] . 
New deals can be approved , although the staff member said that export credit transactions with [LOC Iran  ] were decreasing because it was difficult to find a bank willing to finance the deal . 
[PER Bonet  ] received the information [PER U/S Levey  ] provided with respect to [ORG IRISL  ] and insurance with a great deal of interest . 
He said that recently , the ministry had imposed new information requirements for companies seeking to export possible dual use items . 
Now , the firms have to specify the means of transportation ( including the identity of the shipping company ) and for information on transit countries . 
For shipments to [LOC Iran  ] , it was common practice to have the [ORG Centro Nacional de Inteligencia  ] ( [LOC CNI  ] - [LOC Spain  ] 's main intelligence organization ) check the end user and middlemen links for some operations , often delaying them for up to a month . 
If there is a potential risk or doubt about the information [LOC Iran  ] provides , the Ministry requests further information or denies the operation . 
Ministry staff also noted that [MISC Spanish  ] banks have closed representative offices in [LOC Iran.  ] ------------------- MEETING WITH [ORG REPSOL  ] ------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] and Under Secretary [PER Levey  ] thanked [ORG Repsol YPF General Counselor  ] and Secretary to the Board [PER Luis Suarez de Lezo  ] for [ORG Repsol  ] 's decision not to go ahead with the [MISC South Pars Block 13  ] deal . 
[PER Suarez  ] said that [ORG Repsol  ] 's decision had been a " cruel " one . 
However , [LOC Spain  ] was " sensitive " to the problem of terrorism . 
[PER Suarez  ] said that the company had delayed making a decision for as long as possible , and that it still has hopes for business in [LOC Iran  ] once the nuclear issue is dealt with . 
[PER Suarez  ] said that , so far , [ORG Repsol  ] had not been lucky in developing business in [LOC Iraq  ] , mostly because the competition from bigger rivals was too tough . 
However , [ORG Repsol  ] had been very successful in making new discoveries in [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Libya.  ] ------------------------------------ MEETING WITH THE MINISTRY OF ECONOMY ------------------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER U/S Levey  ] and [ORG DCM  ] met with [ORG Economy Ministry  ] Secretary of State [PER David Vegara  ] and staff . 
The [PER U/S  ] stressed the importance of [LOC Spain  ] supporting the [ORG EU-3  ] 1 [ORG UNSCR  ] implementation proposal . 
One [PER Vegara  ] staff member suggested that [LOC Spain  ] was already largely implementing the proposal through increased banking vigilance , but [PER Levey  ] pointed out that the [ORG EU-3  ] 1 proposal contained other important elements as well . 
The staff member said that [LOC Spain  ] was working with the [LOC U.S.  ] within the [ORG Financial Action Task Force  ] ( [ORG FATF  ] ) to develop guidance on how to implement [ORG UNSCR  ] 1803 ( including on " counter-measures " ) , and [PER U/S Levey  ] thanked him for that support . 
[PER Vegara  ] said that [LOC Spain  ] was on the right side of this issue , and on the matter of containing export credit operations , [LOC Spain  ] had reduced export credits by 30 percent . 
The Secretary of State expressed a great deal of interest in the [ORG IRISL  ] and insurance information provided by [PER U/S Levey  ] . 
[PER Vegara  ] noted , however , that while [LOC Spain  ] has large banks , it does not have large insurance companies , so he doubted that they were involved in insuring cargo destined for [LOC Iran  ] , but the government would look into it . 
Secretary of State [PER Vegara  ] underscored that [LOC Spain  ] was committed to the [LOC Iran  ] financial sanctions issue , but that [LOC Spain  ] had to coordinate with other [ORG EU  ] members . 
He expressed a great deal of interest in Under Secretary Burns' meeting with [MISC Iranian  ] officials . 
[ORG DCM  ] emphasized in this context the need for the international community to continue to make clear the " stark " choice that [LOC Iran  ] faces precisely in order to give diplomacy a better chance to work . 
There was also a discussion of the risk posed by possible collusion between [MISC Libyan-owned  ] banks and [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Vegara  ] and his staff indicated that there was only one such bank in [LOC Spain  ] and they would look into the matter. ----------------------------- MEETING WITH THE CENTRAL BANK ----------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER U/S Levey  ] and [ORG DCM  ] met with Deputy Governor [PER Jose Vinals  ] and staff . 
He too demonstrated great interest in the material the [PER U/S  ] provided . 
[PER Vinals  ] agreed with [PER Levey  ] that [MISC Spanish  ] banks were increasingly unwilling to take any risks with respect to [LOC Iran  ] . 
He said that Banks [ORG Santander  ] and [ORG Sabadell  ] had ceased [MISC Iran-related  ] operations , and that , as far as he knew , [MISC Spanish  ] banks had closed their representation [ORG MADRID  ] 00000836 003 OF 003 offices in [LOC Iran  ] . 
When [PER Levey  ] raised concerns about the risk posed by possible collusion between [MISC Libyan-owned  ] banks and [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Vinals  ] and his staff also indicated that there was only one [MISC Libyan-owned  ] bank in [LOC Spain  ] , [ORG Aresbank  ] . 
They noted that while [ORG Aresbank  ] was [MISC Libyan-owned  ] , it was managed by [MISC Spanish  ] officials . 
They indicated that the majority of [ORG Aresbank  ] 's business was financing equipment and transport to [LOC Libya  ] , which was necessary since roughly 30 percent of [LOC Spain  ] 's oil imports come from [LOC Libya  ] . 
[PER Vinals  ] , nonetheless , noted that any [MISC Libyan-owned  ] bank merited extra scruitiny. ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Under Secretary [PER Levey  ] 's trip was very timely given the upcoming [ORG EU  ] decision on the [ORG EU-3  ] 1 [ORG UNSCR  ] 1803 implementation proposal . 
We do not know whether [LOC Spain  ] will support implementation prior to the summer holidays . 
However , although the [MISC Spaniards  ] , especially the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] , played the perennial Brussels-Member State dance , i.e. suggesting that others might be to blame for an outcome not desired by the [ORG USG  ] , we think the [ORG GOS  ] understands that we are monitoring [LOC Spain  ] 's stance on this issue very carefully. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) Under Secretary [PER Levey  ] has cleared this message .
