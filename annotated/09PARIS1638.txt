( C/NF ) Summary . 
At the mid-point of his five-year term , [MISC French  ] President [PER Sarkozy  ] continues to be the dominant , virtually unchallenged , political force in [LOC France  ] . 
Slowed in domestic reform efforts by entrenched interests and the world-wide financial crisis , [PER Sarkozy  ] is increasingly focused on successfully leveraging [MISC France’s  ] foreign policy influence on the global stage . 
Ambitious and action-oriented , [PER Sarkozy  ] doesn’t hesitate to break traditional [MISC French  ] policies and reach out to new partners , from [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] and [LOC Syria  ] to [LOC India  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] . 
His impatience for results and desire to seize the initiative -- with or without the support of international partners and his own advisors -- challenges us to channel his impulsive proposals into constructive directions with an eye to long-term results . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] himself is firmly convinced of the need for a strong transatlantic partnership and he has long desired to be THE major partner to the [LOC U.S.  ] in [LOC Europe  ] , whether on climate change and non-proliferation or [LOC Iran  ] and the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
Our effort to secure increased [MISC French  ] contributions in [LOC Afghanistan  ] offers an interesting perspective on the centralization of key decision-making powers in the [MISC French  ] President and how to best work with [PER Sarkozy  ] as a valued , and valuable , partner . 
With high-profile events like the [ORG Non-Proliferation Treaty  ] ( [ORG NPT  ] ) prep-com next spring , and [PER Sarkozy  ] preparing to lead [MISC France’s  ] chairmanship of the [MISC G-8/G-20  ] in 2011 , we believe we can best secure our interests across a broad front through continued close consultations with our [MISC French  ] partners ( including , and perhaps especially , at the highest levels ) , with an eye to leveraging [ORG Sarkozy’s  ] strong political standing , desire for action , and willingness to make difficult decisions into force multipliers for our foreign policy interests . 
End Summary. ----------------------------------------- DOMESTIC DRAMA BUT NO DOMESTIC OPPOSITION ----------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) [ORG Sarkozy’s  ] domestic standing is virtually unchallenged despite lagging opinion polls which place his personal approval ratings at 39 percent . 
His center-right [ORG UMP  ] party controls both houses of parliament , and opposition leaders in [LOC France  ] have spent the past two years fighting among themselves rather than mounting any serious political challenge to the incumbent president . 
[MISC Sarkozy’s  ] policy of “openness” in appointing opposition politicians to high-profile positions has contributed to the leadership drain on the left . 
IMF President [PER Dominique Strauss-Kahn  ] and FM [PER Kouchner  ] are just two examples of this successful political ploy . 
Despite this political security -- or perhaps because of it -- there is some internal grumbling about [MISC Sarkozy’s  ] high-handed style within his own party , revealed by the recent attempt to name his 23-year old son [PER Jean Sarkozy  ] , who is still an undergraduate student , to a position at the head of [MISC Paris’s  ] most prestigious business development commission . 
A brilliant political tactician , [PER Sarkozy  ] is raising the profile of the March 2010 regional elections to rally his base and steal voters from the far right as part of a ramp-up to his re-election bid in 2012 . 
While this makes him more sensitive to the near-term domestic political impact of certain foreign policy issues ( like [LOC Afghanistan  ] ) , his domestic stature remains fundamentally secure , freeing him to focus on his goal of leveraging [MISC French  ] power in [LOC Europe  ] and globally. ------------------------------------------ FOREIGN POLICY SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGES ------------------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) The net result of [MISC Sarkozy’s  ] dominance of the domestic political scene is that he is also one of the most secure leaders in [LOC Europe  ] , with no awkward coalition partner or imminent presidential elections to distract or hinder him . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] occasionally recognizes that to be heard on the world stage -- whether on strategic questions or the global financial crisis -- [MISC France’s  ] voice is amplified when speaking in concert with others . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] has worked hard to successfully parlay an initially awkward personal relationship with [MISC German  ] Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] into a smoothly [LOC PARIS  ] 00001638 002 OF 004 coordinated tandem that drives much of [MISC European  ] policy . 
Likewise , he will frequently pair with [PER Merkel  ] and [ORG UK PM Brown  ] to add needed clout to messages in [LOC Brussels  ] and [LOC Washington  ] . 
Sarkozy’s ability to leverage his ( and [MISC France’s  ] ) voice on the world stage by building on strategic partnerships is one of his greatest strengths ; one of his greatest weaknesses , however , may be his impatience and penchant to launch proposals with insufficient consultation with other major players. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) [MISC Sarkozy’s  ] most visible successes to date are largely in the foreign affairs domain , with his greatest achievements within [LOC Europe  ] . 
He championed the [LOC Lisbon  ] treaty in his first months in office , helping to end the stalemate over reform of [ORG EU  ] institutions . 
This was succeeded by his leadership of the rotating [ORG EU  ] presidency in the second half of 2008 , which included the creation of the Union for the [MISC Mediterranean  ] ( [ORG UfM  ] ) , the launch of the [MISC EU’s  ] counter-piracy operation , and his negotiation of a cease-fire after the [MISC Russian  ] invasion of [LOC Georgia  ] . 
Characteristically , he didn’t hesitate to disregard [MISC European  ] sensitivities by attempting to retain the lead on specific portfolios where he doubted the [MISC Czech  ] ability to provide the necessary follow-on [ORG EU  ] lead after [LOC Prague  ] took over the rotating presidency in January 2009 . 
On security issues , [PER Sarkozy  ] is equally bold . 
He personally authorized additional [MISC French  ] troops for [LOC Afghanistan  ] at the 2008 [ORG Bucharest NATO  ] summit and this year he fought to bring [LOC France  ] back into [MISC NATO’s  ] integrated military command , reversing more than 40 years of bipartisan [MISC French  ] policy , in spite of strong skepticism within his own party and intense opposition from others. ------------------------------------------- [LOC NEW PARTNERS  ] , [LOC NEW IDEAS  ] ------------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) In a departure from previous [MISC French  ] leaders , [PER Sarkozy  ] has also devoted a great deal of effort to reaching out bilaterally to countries like [LOC Israel  ] , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] and [LOC Syria  ] , recognizing that they are major players in the [LOC Middle East  ] where [MISC French  ] ambitions have been frustrated . 
[MISC French  ] officials are convinced that [MISC Sarkozy’s  ] outreach to [LOC Syria  ] has made [MISC Syrian  ] President [PER al Asad  ] a more productive partner in resolving [LOC Middle East  ] issues ( although they are hard-pressed to provide concrete examples of a change ) . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] fully recognizes the growing role played by emerging powers like [LOC Brazil  ] ( he has meet with [MISC Brazilian  ] President [PER Lula nine  ] times in the past two years ) and [LOC India  ] ( whose troops he invited to star in the July 14 , 2009 military parade ) . 
He lobbied successfully for the [MISC G-20  ] meeting in [LOC Washington  ] to address the global financial crisis , and he supports an expanded [ORG UN Security Council  ] , which earns him additional popularity among rising powers . 
The Elysee has also looked to [LOC Brazil  ] as a partner in climate change negotiations and a buyer of [MISC French  ] defense equipment -- including potentially the first overseas sale of the [MISC Rafale  ] fighter aircraft . 
All of these outreach efforts stem from genuine convictions as well as an eye to the image of [LOC France  ] at the center of a global network of influential leaders. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Sarkozy  ] is most prone to disappoint when , in his impatience for action , he effectively “gets ahead” of other key players and his own advisors . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] is firmly convinced that the most intractable diplomatic problems can only be solved by getting leaders together in person to cut through bureaucratic red tape and make bold decisions -- hence his predilection for proposing summits . 
He has little patience for the incremental steps of diplomacy and once he latches onto an idea he is loath to let it go . 
Impatient for progress in the [LOC Middle East  ] , he has sought ways to make [LOC France  ] a player , first through creation of the [ORG UfM  ] and second by championing a summit , either in the guise of the [ORG UfM  ] or now through other partners ( such as the [LOC U.S.  ] , the Quartet , etc ) to achieve his goals . 
In another example , his surprise announcement last June in support of a new treaty on [MISC European  ] security architecture took many allies , and his own staff , by surprise . 
Although that debate has been channelled into the [LOC OSCE Corfu  ] process for the present , [PER Sarkozy  ] is already chafing at what he considers lack of progress on this strategic issue and is continuously tasking his staff to come up with new proposals to address the impasse of [LOC CFE  ] , improve the partnership with [LOC Russia  ] , and provide other ideas to overcome blocked initiatives . 
[LOC PARIS  ] 00001638 003 OF 004 ------------------------------------------ NO ONE TO SAY “NO” ------------------------------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Sarkozy  ] has few restraints -- political , personal or ideological -- to act as a brake on his global ambitions . 
Domestically , he rewards party leaders prepared to adopt his policies and marginalizes any opponents with a diverse view . 
Several “favored” cabinet ministers with high profiles early in his administration -- including [PER Rama Yade  ] and [PER Rachida Dati  ] -- were subsequently bumped into secondary jobs after having disagreed with [PER Sarkozy  ] . 
On the other hand , State Secretary for [MISC European  ] Affairs , [PER Pierre Lellouche  ] , willingly muzzled his long-term outspoken support for [MISC Turkish  ] Accession to the [ORG EU  ] in exchange for his current post . 
While [ORG Diplomatic Advisor  ] ( [ORG NSA-equivalent  ] ) [PER Jean-David Levitte  ] remains a key player , with an extensive background in diplomacy and a calming personality , other advisors like Secretary General [PER Claude Gueant  ] are playing an increasingly public role . 
Despite having Sarkozy’s ear to various degrees , few appear to exercise any significant degree of influence over the activist president. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C/NF ) Sarkozy’s own advisors likewise demonstrate little independence and appear to have little effect on curbing the hyperactive president , even when he is at his most mercurial . 
Elysee contacts have reported to us the great lengths they will go to avoid disagreeing with him or provoking his displeasure -- even recently reportedly re-routing the President’s plane to avoid his seeing the [LOC Eiffel Tower  ] lit up in [LOC Turkey’s  ] colors on the visit of PM [PER Erdogan  ] ( a decision made by the [LOC Paris  ] city hall ) . 
After two years in office , many seasoned key Elysee staff are leaving for prestigious onward assignments as a reward for their hard work , raising questions as to whether new faces will be any more willQg to point out when the emperor is less than fully dressed. ------------------------------------------- WORKING TOGETHER IN THE FUTURE ------------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) When he was elected in 2007 , [PER Sarkozy  ] was among the first [MISC French  ] leaders to openly embrace the [LOC United States  ] , despite a [LOC U.S.  ] administration very unpopular in [LOC Europe  ] at the time . 
This was due to Sarkozy’s conviction that [LOC France  ] can accomplish more in cooperation with , rather than opposition to , the [LOC United States  ] . 
When then-Senator and presidential candidate [PER Obama  ] came to [LOC France  ] in July 2008 , [PER Sarkozy  ] cleared his schedule to meet with him and further broke his own protocol rules and held a joint press conference ( a privilege normally reserved exclusively for visiting heads of state ) . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] is prepared to be the [MISC U.S.’s  ] key partner in [LOC Europe  ] and is hoping for intense regular contact with President [PER Obama  ] ( which enhances Sarkozy’s domestic stature and therefore directly increases his ability to make hard decisions ) . 
[MISC French  ] journalists are pointing out with increasing frequency that [PER Sarkozy  ] has not paid a [LOC White House  ] call on President [PER Obama  ] , and [MISC French  ] officials are beginning to express concern over this perceived lack of high-level visits and other regular consultations . 
Journalists and officials alike are expressing the concern that [LOC France  ] , and [LOC Europe  ] as a whole , may be of less strategic importance to the [LOC United States  ] today ( a view that , all things being equal , does not enhance their incentives to work closely with us ) . <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C/NF ) On strategic questions , [LOC Paris  ] is frequently willing to back [LOC U.S.  ] positions , even in the face of general [MISC European  ] reluctance . 
[LOC Paris  ] has welcomed [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to “re-set” relations with [LOC Russia  ] and has consistently emphasized developing a common approach with [LOC Washington  ] toward [LOC Moscow  ] . 
On [LOC Iran  ] , Presidents [PER Sarkozy  ] remains personally engaged and is willing to work intensely within [LOC Europe  ] ( both institutionally in the [ORG EU  ] and through efforts to persuade individual countries to adopt national measures ) . 
On non-proliferation and disarmament issues , the [ORG GOF  ] has urged regular consultations in the run up to the 2010 [ORG NPT Review Conference  ] and launch of discussions on a FMCT treaty . 
The most important thing for [MISC French  ] officials and [PER Sarkozy  ] himself is to feel like they are part oQthe decision-making process and not simply called in to ratify decisions after they have been made in [LOC Washington.  ] --------------------------------------------- AFGHANISTAN: AN ILLUSTRATIVE CASE [LOC PARIS  ] 00001638 004 OF 004 --------------------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C/NF ) Our effort to secure increased [MISC French  ] contributions to [LOC Afghanistan  ] underlines how much decision-making power is vested in the [MISC French  ] president and how best we can work with him to achieve desired results . 
Last year , on our request , President [PER Sarkozy  ] went against all of his political and military advisors to deploy a [MISC French  ] OMLT to assist the [MISC Dutch  ] forces in [LOC Uruzgan  ] , a critical reinforcement of a key ally . 
It was also [PER Sarkozy  ] alone who made the decision to deploy an additional 700 troops at last year’s [LOC Bucharest  ] summit -- at the time of the announcement , even key staff were still unsure what the final decision would be . 
This year , in intense exchanges with all the major [MISC French  ] players including FM [ORG Kouchner  ] , [ORG NSA-equivalent  ] [PER Levitte  ] and [MISC French  ] [PER CHOD Georgelin  ] , each one expressed support for [LOC U.S.  ] policy but were doubtful about additional [MISC French  ] financial or military resources , frequently citing Sarkozy’s earlier statement of “no additional troops.” <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C/NF ) However , following a direct conversation with President [PER Obama  ] , President [PER Sarkozy  ] dropped the formerly firm “no” position and moved forward more quickly and proactively than we envisioned , opening the door to military reinforcements “in time” and promising increased financial and training assistance . 
Although the specifics are not yet provided , the personal outreach to President [PER Sarkozy  ] made the difference between getting a cautious bureaucratic response and a genuine commitment from a key ally when we needed it . 
The [MISC French  ] press led their reports noting [PER Sarkozy  ] was the first foreign leader on [MISC Obama’s  ] call sheet , thereby increasing the pressure on [PER Sarkozy  ] to respond favorably. --------------------------------------------- COMMENT --------------------------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C/NF ) Comment: As one of [MISC Europe’s  ] most politically secure leaders at the head of a country with significant ability to contribute more to global problem-solving across a broad front , from [LOC Afghanistan  ] to climate change , economic stabilization , [LOC Iran  ] , and the [LOC Middle East Peace Process  ] , [PER Sarkozy  ] represents a key actor in the fulfillment of our shared policy goals . 
We will not always see eye-to-eye , and differences on key issues ( such as non-proliferation and disarmament , which are seen as critical to [MISC French  ] national interests ) are looming . 
However , though enhanced consultation ( including , and perhaps especially , at the highest levels ) , I believe we can address these differences , minimize unhelpful proposals and foster increased collaboration to better leverage [MISC French  ] interests to fulfill ours . 
[LOC France  ] is a like-minded country with a major economy and the second-largest deployed military and diplomatic forces in the world . 
By striking the right note in our bilateral relationship , we can leverage Sarkozy’s strengths , including his willingness to take a stand on unpopular issues , to be a major contributor to [LOC U.S.  ] goals . 
We must also recognize that [PER Sarkozy  ] has an extraordinary degree of decision-making power which is vested in him alone as the [MISC French  ] president . 
In my opinion it will necessitQe periodic PreQntial intervention to reassure [PER Sarkozy  ] of our commitment as an ally and partner and , in many cases , to close the deal . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] will remain a power to be reckoned with in [LOC France  ] and a significant driver of [LOC Europe  ] for the foreseeable future . 
It is clearly in our interest to work hard to channel his energy and initiatives into a constructive form of cooperation that enhances our ability to solve global issues together .
