( [ORG SBU  ] ) Land invasions led by the [MISC Movimento  ] dos Trabalhadores Rurais [PER Sem Terra  ] ( [ORG Landless Rural Workers Movement  ] - [ORG MST  ] ) and allied groups have begun in the [LOC Sao Paulo  ] Consular District ( southern and part of southeastern [LOC Brasil  ] ) in anticipation of the annual [MISC Red April  ] protests ( ref A ) . 
Early March [ORG MST  ] activity has occurred nationwide , with a number of invasions in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , [LOC Parana  ] , [LOC Rio Grande  ] do Sul , and [ORG Mato Grosso  ] do Sul states since the beginning of the year . 
Two thousand members of a women 's movement apparently allied with [ORG MST  ] gained extensive and negative press coverage for their destruction of private agribusiness property , including seedlings , research results , and laboratory facilities , valued at USD 400,000 . 
Despite an active early year , " [MISC Red April  ] " of 2005 in the [LOC Sao Paulo  ] Consular district was relatively quiet , in deference to the recently deceased [PER Pope John Paul  ] II and in preparation for the nationwide protest march that occurred in May 2005 . 
There are clear indications , however , that invasions and protests in 2006 will be more vigorous . 
END SUMMARY . 
EARLY YEAR INVASIONS -------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The first months of 2006 have seen a spate of land invasions in the [LOC Pontal  ] do [LOC Paranapanema  ] in the far west of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] state , and in [LOC Rio Grande  ] do Sul , BrazilQs southernmost state . 
On January 7 , the [ORG MST  ] conducted its largest land invasion since 2003 in the [LOC Pontal  ] , as over 500 landless workers invaded eight farms . 
According to the invasion coordinator , [PER Vagumiar Nunes  ] , the January action was a protest against the broken promises of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] Governor ( and now opposition presidential candidate ) [PER Geraldo Alckmin  ] , who , during his gubernatorial campaign in 2002 , pledged to " settle " 1,400 landless families . 
( [ORG NOTE:  ] The [LOC Pontal  ] region has traditionally been a focus of land disputes due to a history of forged land deeds and illegal sales of property , resulting in possession of the land by now wealthy and established farmers . 
In some cases , the state has sought to reclaim title , and the ambiguity is exploited by [ORG MST  ] . 
END NOTE ) In [LOC Rio Grande  ] do Sul , the 2,000 landless workers occupying a 7,000 hectare ranch , [PER Fazenda Coqueiros  ] , received word that they will have to depart , by order of civil judge [PER Orlando Faccini Neto  ] . 
The current occupation of [PER Fazenda Coqueiros  ] is the fourth invasion of the property since 2004 . 
( [ORG NOTE: Brigadier Colonel  ] [PER Waldir Cerutti  ] reportedly stated that nearly 600 military police would be needed to oust the occupiers . 
END NOTE . 
) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
Allied with the [ORG QVia CampesinaQ Rural Movement  ] and foreign [ORG NGOs  ] , [ORG MST  ] has registered the largest number of early-year land invasions in the past five years . 
( [ORG NOTE: In  ] an interesting March 9 photo in the large-circulation daily [ORG QO Estado  ] de [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , Q [ORG MST  ] leader [PER Joao Pedro Stedile  ] is seen at a demonstration in bright green [ORG Via Campesina  ] hat and scarf , rather than the usual red [ORG MST  ] gear . 
END NOTE . 
) In addition to its land invasions , [ORG MST  ] has also established a [LOC Qparallel  ] conferenceQ near the site of the March 20-31 8th Conference of the Parties ( [MISC COP-8  ] ) to the [MISC UN Convention  ] on [ORG Biological Diversity  ] ( [ORG CBD  ] ) in [LOC Curitiba  ] , [LOC Parana  ] state . 
Demonstrations have been peaceful . 
LONG-TIME [ORG MST  ] LEADER PUNISHED BY SUPERIORS ------------------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Jose Rainha Jr.  ] , long-time prominent [ORG MST  ] leader in the [LOC Pontal  ] do [LOC Paranapanema  ] , was recently divested of responsibility by [ORG MST  ] higher-ups for failure to obey orders and to follow the principles and norms of the movement . 
He is accused of participating in " isolated and individual negotiations and acts without authority " of the [ORG MST  ] hierarchy . 
The media reported [ORG MST  ] leadershipQs unhappiness with a public embrace of President [PER Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  ] by [PER Rainha  ] when the two met during a series of invasions of public buildings last September in northern [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[ORG MST  ] authorities have forbidden [PER Rainha  ] to speak on behalf of the movement . 
[ORG MST  ] leadership , dissatisfied with the slow rate of land redistribution in the country , has stepped up its criticism of the [MISC Brazilian  ] j ustice system , arguing that it serves the needs of the landholding elite . 
[ORG MST  ] spokesperson [PER Jaime Amorim  ] reported that there is a belief among [MISC Brazilian  ] judges that the landless movement is criminal and should be treated as such . 
AGRI-BUSINESS ATTACKED ---------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) On March 8 , 2000 , women militants of the " [MISC Movimento  ] das [PER Mulheres Camponesas  ] ( [ORG Peasant Women 's Movement  ] ) , " a group apparently allied with the [ORG MST  ] and [ORG Via Campesina  ] , invaded an agri-business facility in [LOC Rio Grande  ] do Sul . 
The attackers destroyed research files , experimental seedlings , and other property at the [LOC Aracruz Cellulose  ] company installation . 
[LOC Aracruz Cellulose  ] , a [MISC Brazilian  ] leader in breeding and development of primary stock for silviculture , claims to have lost twenty years of research in breeding and propagation studies . 
On March 15 , 600 rural activists invaded an experimental farm of the multinational [ORG Syngenta Seeds  ] in rural [LOC Parana  ] state , in protest of their use of GMOs . 
According to press reports , the government plans to prosecute [ORG MST  ] leader [PER Stedile  ] for his public comments in support of the attack on [LOC Aracruz Cellulose  ] , which caused USD 400,000 worth of damage. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Just days after the March 14 announcement as the [ORG Brazilian Social Democracy PartyQs  ] ( [ORG PSDB  ] ) presidential nominee , [LOC Sao Paulo  ] governor [PER Geraldo Alckmin  ] stated that he believes the [ORG MST  ] has traded its original agenda of legitimate agrarian reform for " vandalism . 
" [PER Alckmin  ] was quoted in the press as saying that " invading laboratories and research centers has nothing to do with agrarian reform . 
" When asked how he would reform agriculture if elected President , [PER Alckmin  ] stated that while agrarian reform is necessary , mere land redistribution is not enough . 
Technical support is essential , as is selection of those likely to have success working the land . 
COMMENT: NOT MUCH SYMPATHY FROM PRESS OR PUBLIC --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG MST  ] leadership has promised an active early year , filled with land invasions , highway shutdowns and other demonstrations , before the country turns its attention to the [MISC World Cup  ] in June and the election campaign later in the year . 
Press reporting of the rural protest activities is particularly heavy this year , and much of it is negative . 
The popular [MISC Brazilian  ] weekly [LOC QVeja  ] compared the March 8 actions of women militants against the [LOC Aracruz Cellulose  ] facility to the burning of books by [LOC Nazi Germany  ] or the [MISC Spanish  ] Inquisition . 
Public opinion is also critical: According to a recent poll conducted by the [ORG Brazilian Institute  ] for Public Opinion and Education ( [ORG IBOPE  ] ) , 56 percent of those surveyed held a negative view of MSTQs actions , 76 percent believed invasions of privately held land weakens democracy , and 67 percent believed that the government is not able to control the invasions . 
[ORG MST  ] , however , purportedly does not care . 
As another leader , [PER Jaime Amorim  ] , put it , QWeQre not worried about our image.Q End comment .
