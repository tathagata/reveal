End Summary. ---------------------- Difficult Negotiations ---------------------- 2 . 
( C ) In a June 11 meeting with [ORG ECMIN  ] , AmCit [PER Shawn McCormick  ] , [ORG TNK-BP  ] 's Vice President for [ORG International Relations  ] ( strictly protect ) said negotiations between [ORG BP  ] and [ORG AAR  ] , the company 's billionaire partners in [ORG TNK-BP  ] , were on-going but had so far failed to yield results . 
[PER McCormick  ] foreshadowed the flurry of public statements and press articles this past weekend by noting that [ORG BP  ] was willing to consider proposals that would " monetize " the [ORG AAR  ] partners stakes , including through shares in [ORG BP  ] , but that the [MISC Russians  ] partners were not negotiating in good faith and appeared prepared to continue using government agencies and the [MISC Russian  ] courts to pursue their aims . 
3 . 
( C ) [PER McCormick  ] added that the public claims that the [MISC Russian  ] partners wanted to go international and that [ORG BP  ] feared the competition were " spin . 
" In fact , the [ORG Alfa  ] partners and in particular [MISC German  ] [PER Khan  ] had been using the company 's resources to vest projects in places [ORG BP  ] couldn't invest , such as [LOC Kurdistan  ] , [LOC Cuba  ] , [LOC Burma  ] and the like . 
When the [ORG TNK-BP  ] board rejected these proposals , [PER Khan  ] would then slide them to a separate company that [ORG Alfa  ] controlled , an arrangement that suited [PER Khan  ] and his [ORG Alfa  ] partners fine . 
The real issue remained control of the company , with which the [MISC Russian  ] partners would be able to either maximize their profits at [ORG BP  ] 's expense by , for instance , directing procurement to other companies that they owned at artificial prices or ensure that they received top dollar for their shares if forced to sell . 
4 . 
( C ) [PER McCormick  ] said [ORG BP  ] 's sense was that the [ORG GOR  ] appeared to have decided not to intervene to resolve the dispute , despite the damage it was doing to the country 's investment climate by allowing state institutions to be used against a foreign investor . 
In that regard , he singled out newly promoted Presidential [PER Aide Dvorkovich  ] for criticism . 
[PER McCormick  ] said [PER Dvorkovich  ] 's comments in [LOC St. Petersburg  ] to the effect that [ORG Gazprom  ] buying the [MISC Russian  ] stake would be the " worst " possible outcome had been extremely unhelpful . 
[ORG Gazprom  ] was also taking a wait and see approach , which [PER McCormick  ] said he suspected was the result of government pressure . 
5 . 
( C ) [PER McCormick  ] said the window to resolve the dispute without an open rupture was closing . 
The work permits of most of the foreign managers at [ORG TNK-BP  ] , including the company 's president , [PER Amcit Robert Dudley  ] , and himself were set to expire at the end of July . 
In the event that the foreign managers were forced out of the company , [ORG BP  ] would seek redress through the binding arbitration agreed to in the company 's charter and would go after the [ORG AAR  ] partners foreign holdings. --------- [LOC U.S.  ] Role --------- 6 . 
( C ) [PER McCormick  ] expressed appreciation for [LOC U.S.  ] efforts on [ORG BP  ] 's behalf , especially Commerce Secretary [PER Gutierrez  ] 's press availability at the [LOC St. Petersburg Economic Forum  ] , where [PER Gutierrez  ] had publicly noted the concerns of the foreign business community about transparency , the law , and the way state institutions were being used in the dispute . 
He said this was exactly the right message [LOC U.S.  ] officials should deliver in the event that future opportunities presented themselves. -------------------------- Investment House Concerned -------------------------- 7 . 
( C ) Separately , [ORG ECMIN  ] also met June 11 with [ORG Renaissance Capital  ] 's Head of Research , [PER Roland Nash  ] . 
The discussion was primarily about the new government 's implementation of economic reforms ( septel ) . 
However , [PER Nash  ] raised [ORG TNK-BP  ] , noting that it was his sense that both the foreign and [MISC Russian  ] business communities were increasingly concerned at the apparent ability of the [ORG AAR  ] partners to use state institutions for personal gain . 
[PER Nash  ] said he was not sure the [ORG GOR  ] understood that this was undermining [PER Medvedev  ] 's statements on reducing official corruption and that this would have repercussions for foreign investment .
