( C ) Summary: Thirty-six year old filmmaker and presidential candidate [PER Marco Enriquez-Ominami  ] has a cinematic life story: father martyred , raised in exile , young [PER Marco  ] returns to home full of resentment , marries a TV star , and gets the backing of a pro-Castro revolutionary-turned-millionaire to become an unexpected political force . 
In his short political career , [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] has distinguished himself primarily by bucking the political establishment and refusing to toe the party line while simultaneously leveraging his establishment connections , including the influence of his senator step-father and celebrity wife . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) This is the third in a series of profiles of the major [MISC Chilean  ] presidential candidates . 
Ref A introduces opposition candidate [PER Sebastian Pinera  ] , Ref B highlights Concertacion candidate [PER Eduardo Frei  ] . 
[LOC Chile  ] 's first round presidential election will be held December 13 and the anticipated run-off will be on January 17 , if required ( Ref C ) . 
[ORG Revolutionary Family Ties  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Marco Enriquez-Ominami  ] 's tragic childhood has all the elements of a great [LOC Hollywood  ] movie: love triangles , political intrigue , violence , exile , and eventual reconciliation . 
[PER Marco Enriquez-Ominami Gumucio  ] ( then known as [PER Marco Enriquez Gumucio  ] ) was born June 12 , 1973 in [LOC Concepcion  ] , [LOC Chile  ] to [PER Miguel Enriquez  ] , who was the leader of the armed [MISC Marxist-Leninist  ] group [ORG Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionario  ] ( [ORG MIR  ] , the [ORG Revolutionary Leftist Movement  ] ) , and [PER Manuela Gumucio  ] , a journalist and author . 
His parents both came from the [MISC Chilean  ] elite: [PER Gumucio  ] 's father was a senator and a founder of the [ORG Christian Democrat  ] party ; the [PER Enriquez  ] family was a well-established part of the [LOC Concepcion  ] intelligentsia . 
The relationship between [PER Enriquez  ] and [PER Gumucio  ] was a short-lived affair that ended before baby [PER Marco  ] was born. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) After the coup in September 1973 , a military decree stripped baby [PER Marco  ] and his mother of their [MISC Chilean  ] citizenship and ordered their expulsion from [LOC Chile  ] . 
Using [ORG UN  ] refugee travel documents , they sought asylum in [LOC France  ] , where they remained until <a id='par1986' href='#par1986'>¶</a>1986 . 
[PER Miguel Enriquez  ] remained in [LOC Chile  ] and was assassinated by [MISC Chilean  ] intelligence agents in October 1974 . 
In [LOC France  ] , [PER Gumucio  ] was a single mother who worked to support herself and her son . 
[PER Young Marco  ] was raised largely by his grandparents , who were also exiled in [LOC France  ] . 
[PER Gumucio  ] eventually partnered with [PER Carlos Ominami  ] , another [ORG MIR  ] revolutionary who sought refuge in [LOC France  ] , and [PER Ominami  ] adopted [PER Marco  ] . 
( [PER Marco Enriquez Gumucio  ] changed his name to [PER Marco Enriquez-Ominami Gumucio  ] in 2000 . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] returned to [LOC Chile  ] in 1986 but had trouble adjusting . 
He spoke no [MISC Spanish  ] initially and was teased and beaten up at school . 
Although he was more accepted over time , he remained something of an outsider . 
As a young man , he had the twin burden of his famous fathers , [PER Enriquez  ] , the revolutionary martyr ; and [PER Ominami  ] , a " baron of the Concertation " who served as Minister of Economy when [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] was in college . 
[ORG SANTIAGO  ] 00000919 002 OF 005 [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] studied philosophy at the [ORG University of Chile  ] from 1990-1995 and film direction in [LOC Paris  ] in 1996 . 
[PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] has spoken of his youthful promiscuity and drug use , and friends say that it was only upon becoming a father that he truly settled down . 
From Filmmaker to [ORG Politician:  ] A " Discolo " is Born --------------------------------------------- -------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] began his television and film career in 1998 , working as the executive director for the production firm [ORG Rivas  ] y [ORG Rivas  ] . 
In 2002 , he directed his most well-known work , a documentary called " [LOC Chile  ] , the Heroes are Tired , " which criticized former leftist [MISC Chilean  ] revolutionaries for having compromised their ideals once they achieved power . 
He also became involved in politics , working on his father 's senatorial campaigns in 1993 and 1999 , [PER Ricardo Lagos'  ] presidential campaigns in 1993 and 1999 , and municipal elections in 2004. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] made his own entry into politics in 2005 , when he won a decisive majority in a [LOC Valparaiso  ] district to become a member of the [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] , the lower house of parliament . 
His supporters proudly point to his charisma as the reason why [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] , running as a Socialist ( President [PER Bachelet  ] 's party ) , was able to prevail in a district that has typically been much more conservative . 
Detractors highlight that he choose to run in the district that his famous and well-respected father represents in the [ORG Senate  ] , asserting that he essentially rode his fathers' coattails into power . 
In September 2008 , his victory was tarnished when his campaign chief , [PER Edgardo Lepe  ] , was convicted of fraud for misusing public funds to hire workers for the campaigns of father and son . 
( [PER Note: Enriquez-Ominami  ] and his father have said they were not aware of the scheme and neither has been accused of any wrong-doing . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) As a politician , [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] takes pride in his independence and non-conformity and is continually described in the press as a " discolo , " meaning unruly person . 
However , his failure to toe the party line has often created hard feelings among his compatriots . 
In [ORG Congress  ] , he snubbed many of his congressional colleagues , has occasionally been in shoving matches with enemies , and regularly rejects the congressional dining hall in favor of eating separately with the other discolos , a group his colleagues refer to as " Marquito y su corte de los milagros " ( [PER Little Marco  ] and his elite circle ) . 
[PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] continued his own presidential campaign even after his political party , the Socialists , officially endorsed [PER Eduardo Frei  ] . 
( He resigned from the party several months later and is now running as an independent . 
) His congressional colleagues have responded in kind to [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] 's offenses , declaring him a " bicho raro " ( wierdo ) and never giving him the opportunity to preside over a commission , on opporutnity that his other Concertacion colleagues have had . 
[ORG Christian Democrat Senator  ] and former presidential candidate [PER Soledad Alvear  ] complained privately to [LOC Poloff  ] that [PER Marco  ] and his ilk never participate in the real work of [ORG Congress  ] , they just show up to complain about the work that everyone else has done . 
The Personality Behind the [ORG Politician: Tragedy , Films  ] , and [LOC France  ] [ORG SANTIAGO  ] 00000919 003 OF 005 --------------------------------------------- ---------------------- ------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Three things define [MISC Enriquez-Ominami:  ] his tragic history , his filmmaking expertise , and his [MISC French  ] education . 
[PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] has had a difficult time coming to terms with his personal history . 
His resentment towards [LOC Chile  ] has come to haunt him in this campaign , as statements from 2003 have re-surfaced , notably that the [MISC Chilean  ] flag was " porqueria " ( pig shit ) and that being born [MISC Chilean  ] was a tragedy . 
In more recent years , [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] has combined the storytelling ability he developed as a filmmaker with his family background to speak out effectively and movingly about his remarkable personal story . 
[PER Miguel Enriquez  ] 's legacy seems to loom large in his son 's life . 
Some friends have said that [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] competes with his biological father 's accomplishments , noting that he decided to launch his political career at the age of 30 -- the age at which his father died. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Advisor and confidante [PER Max Marambio  ] describes [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] as " a product of his [MISC French  ] education , " noting that he is liberal , self-critical , honest , and free-thinking . 
He also seems to have picked up some of the typical [MISC French  ] skepticism of the [LOC U.S.  ] , frequently using the tag line " What is in the best interests of the [LOC U.S.  ] is not always in best interests of [LOC Chile  ] . 
" <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] is hard-working and sleeps little , often sending emails out as late as 2 a.m. and as early as 6 a.m. in the same day , campaign advisors note . 
He is irreverent and audacious , and admits his mistakes easily . 
Extremely personable , he does very well in face-to-face interactions and in media interviews . 
Perhaps because he is so people-oriented , he does not like to deliver bad news or reprimands by person , instead sending them by email . 
The Accidental Candidate --------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] 's success thus far has taken even the candidate 's closest advisors by surprise . 
[PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] confidantes [PER Max Marambio  ] and Deputy [PER Alvaro Escobar  ] told [PER Poloff  ] that , one year ago , the presidential candidate was fed up with political life and had discarded the idea of running for re-election in the [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] . 
He was seriously weighing an offer from [ORG Duke University  ] to be a visiting professor of film when someone off-handedly suggested that he should leave his political career in a blaze of glory: Why not run for president ? 
Advisors suggest that [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] 's campaign started as one last opportunity to thumb his nose at the political system he was so frustrated with , and its success took everyone--even the candidate himself--by surprise . 
To this day , [PER Marambio  ] , [PER Carlos Ominami  ] , [PER Ciro Colombara  ] and other close advisors admit that [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] 's chances of actually becoming [LOC Chile  ] 's next president are slim . 
However , they are pleased ( and amazed ) that the campaign has come this far and rightly feel that they have already had a great deal of success in changing the political debate , particularly in bringing discussion of gay rights and civil unions to the public square . 
[ORG SANTIAGO  ] 00000919 004 OF 005 Max Marambio: The Wealthy and Controversial " Friend of [PER Fidel  ] " Behind [PER Marco  ] 's Campaign --------------------------------------------- ---------------------- --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) In a life studded with celebrities and fascinating characters , [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] 's chief campaign financier and political advisor , leftist revolutionary-turned-millionaire [PER Max Marambio  ] , is the most interesting of all . 
As a young man , [PER Marambio  ] joined the [ORG MIR  ] and led [PER Salvador Allende  ] 's presidential bodyguard team . 
He lived in the [MISC Cuban  ] embassy in [LOC Santiago  ] for 10 months following the coup , before fleeing first to [LOC Switzerland  ] and then to [LOC Cuba  ] , where he studied political science at the [ORG University of Havana  ] and trained with the [MISC Cuban  ] special forces . 
He participated in secret [MISC Cuban  ] military and commercial missions to [LOC Angola  ] , [LOC Lebanon  ] , [LOC Korea  ] , [LOC Central America  ] , and [LOC Europe  ] , allegedly including a role in hiding [PER Fidel Castro  ] 's personal fortune . 
In the late 1970s , he began a joint venture food company with the [MISC Cuban  ] government which eventually became [ORG International Network Group  ] , a holding company which generates [LOC US  ] $80 million in profits in [LOC Cuba  ] each year from food products and tourism. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Marambio  ] , who told [PER Poloff  ] he was a " close personal friend " of [PER Fidel Castro  ] , was also a friend of [PER Miguel Enriquez  ] but passed up several opportunities to meet the revolutionary 's son . 
When [PER Marambio  ] and [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] finally met seven years ago , a close friendship soon developed: [PER Marambio  ] attended [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] 's lavish wedding ( making a splash with his helicopter arrival ) and years later became godfather to [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] 's daughter . 
Although not initially involved in [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] 's presidential campaign , [PER Marambio  ] became the key player in July , just as the campaign really took off . 
Today , [PER Marambio  ] is using his large personal fortune to finance [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] 's campaign and is the candidate 's closest political advisor . 
Despite pouring his time , talent , and considerable effort into the campaign , [PER Marambio  ] told [PER Poloff  ] he has no political ambitions of his own--he is too busy with his extended family , his business , and his two-month-long annual vacation in [LOC Italy  ] to take a government position . 
[PER Marco  ] 's Not-So-Secret Weapon: His Wife --------------------------------------------- ---------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) While [PER Marambio  ] is the power ( and money ) behind the throne , [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] 's wife , TV star [PER Karen Doggenweiler  ] , is his most visible supporter . 
[PER Doggenweiler  ] , who married [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] in 2003 , is one of [LOC Chile  ] 's most well-known and beloved celebrities , far eclipsing her husband in terms of name recognition and respect . 
Compared to [PER Eva Peron  ] for her star power ( though not for prior political involvement ) , [PER Doggenweiler  ] has hosted a number of national television programs , from a morning talk show to a boot-camp reality show . 
[PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] and [PER Doggenweiler  ] have two children: 14-year-old [PER Fernanda  ] , [PER Doggenweiler  ] 's daughter from a previous relationship ; and 5-year-old [PER Manuela.  ] <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) Observers inside and outside the campaign believe that [PER Doggenweiler  ] 's presence is responsible for much of her husband 's political success thus far . 
[MISC Christian Democrat  ] leader [PER Soledad Alvear  ] asserted that 75% of [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] 's support is from people who are really backing his wife , while campaign advisor [PER Ciro SANTIAGO  ] 00000919 005 OF 005 [PER Colombara  ] suggested that [PER Doggenweiler  ] 's ability to connect with rural and small town voters may be the deciding factor in whether or not her husband makes it past the first round election and to the runoff . 
Following criticism that she was capitalizing on her continued TV presence to help her husband , [PER Doggenweiler  ] recently took a four month leave of absence from work to focus on campaigning . 
Comment ------------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) As a presidential candidate , [PER Marco Enriquez-Ominami  ] has been hard to take seriously . 
Only 36 years old , his scant time in public office has been spent disparaging the political system , and his major qualifications are his charm , his evocative double-barrelled name , and the beautiful and widely admired woman by his side . 
He hardly seems to be a leader that stereotypically responsible , sober [MISC Chileans  ] would rally around . 
Thus , [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] 's incredible rise has taken everyone by surprise , even the candidate 's own backers . 
Yet for voters who are tired of Concertacion rule but feel that a vote for conservative candidate [PER Sebastian Pinera  ] is a vote for [PER Pinochet  ] 's legacy , supporting [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] is a way to vote for change while remaining a progressive . 
While he is a long shot to win the presidency this year , he has effectively stirred up the 2009 presidential campaign , which otherwise has been dominated by long-standing political figures from the center-left and center-right . 
Assuming he does not make it to the second round in the December election , the question is what role , if any , will he play in [MISC Chilean  ] politics going forward . 
After 20 years in power , the center-left needs revitalization , but it remains to be seen if this charismatic but mercurial figure with no party backing and little political experience will be an effective force in shaping those changes .
