END SUMMARY <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( SBU ) In meetings with key [ORG Government of Brazil  ] ( [ORG GOB  ] ) officials on October 28 in [LOC Brasilia  ] , the Special Representative of the President for [MISC Nuclear Non-proliferation  ] , Ambassador [PER Susan Burk  ] , advanced the agenda of the [ORG U.S. Government  ] ( [ORG USG  ] ) in preparation for the 2010 [MISC Non-Proliferation Treaty  ] ( NPT ) review conference ( [ORG RevCon  ] ) . 
( [ORG REFTEL  ] A . 
) The [MISC Brazilians  ] were interested in the topic , well-informed , and appreciative of the opportunity to have an open and frank discussion with the [MISC USG.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Building on President [PER Obama  ] 's speech on nonproliferation in [LOC Prague  ] and Secretary [PER Clinton  ] 's recent speech on nonproliferation at the [ORG U.S. Institute for Peace  ] , [PER Amb  ] . 
[PER Burk  ] sketched out the [ORG USG  ] vision for the 2010 NPT RevCon . 
She stressed in her meetings with [MISC Brazilian  ] officials the need to make progress on the three pillars of the NPT: disarmament ; non-proliferation ; and peaceful use of nuclear technology . 
On disarmament , she outlined the [ORG USG  ] 's efforts , particularly the START disarmament negotiations with [LOC Russia  ] , plans to ratify the [MISC Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty  ] ( [MISC CTBT  ] ) , and negotiating a [ORG Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty  ] ( [MISC FCMT  ] ) . 
With respect to non-proliferation , she emphasized the need to strengthen the safeguards regime , especially in light of the current regime 's failure to uncover the undeclared nuclear facilities in [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Syria  ] . 
The NPT RevCon should look at the issue of withdrawal , particularly in cases where state party is not in compliance . 
[PER Burk  ] foresaw a " " nuclear energy renaissance " " and so the peaceful use pillar is significant . 
President [PER Obama  ] wants to see that the [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency  ] ( [ORG IAEA  ] ) has the resources and authorities to play its role , she explained . 
We want to see a safe , reliable and secure nuclear sector ; this means there will need to be accountability with increasing use of nuclear technology . 
[PER Burk  ] said that the [ORG USG  ] wanted to know [LOC Brazil  ] 's priorities and concerns and also sought the [ORG GOB  ] 's advice on how to make progress at the [ORG RevCon  ] , especially in working with other groups . 
GOOD REACTION FROM MINISTRY OF [ORG EXTERNAL RELATIONS  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [ORG Ministry of External Relations Under  ] Secretary for Political Affairs , Ambassador [PER Vera Machado  ] , stated that [PER Amb  ] . 
[PER Burk  ] was " " using my talking points " " with the emphasis on making progress on all three pillars at the [ORG REVCON  ] . 
[PER Machado  ] said that the [ORG GOB  ] " " in principle is very close to the [LOC U.S.  ] position " " and it " " will have a constructive attitude for the " " 2010 NPT REVCON . 
[PER Machado  ] noted that she was pleased by President [PER Obama  ] 's non-proliferation speech in [LOC Prague  ] and the [ORG UN Special Session  ] on nonproliferation . 
The [ORG GOB  ] considered the 2000 NPT REVCON to have been very successful , but not the 2005 conference. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) U/S [PER Machado  ] and [PER Amb  ] . 
[PER Burk  ] had a cordial discussion about two sensitive nonproliferation issues: the [ORG IAEA  ] [MISC Additional Protocol  ] and the proposals for nuclear fuel banks . 
[PER Burk  ] recognized that the [ORG GOB  ] may not yet be ready to sign an [ORG IAEA  ] [MISC Additional Protocol  ] , still she underscored that the [ORG USG  ] considered the [MISC Additional Protocol  ] as a measure to provide greater confidence in the safeguards regime . 
[PER Burk  ] noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Senate  ] had ratified its [MISC Additional Protocol  ] . 
While the [ORG GOB  ] is considering the issue , [PER Burk  ] urged the [ORG GOB  ] to consider supporting a consensus that the [MISC Additional Protocol  ] can be a valuable tool . 
She mentioned [ORG National Security Advisor Jim Jones'  ] offer to have technical experts come to the [LOC United States  ] to discuss the [MISC Additional Protocol  ] with [ORG USG  ] experts . 
U/S [PER Machado  ] said that the issue of the [MISC Additional Protocol  ] is under discussion in [LOC Brazil  ] , but she didn't know when the [ORG GOB  ] might be ready to sign one . 
[PER Machado  ] stated that the proposal to send experts to the [LOC United States  ] was a good idea. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) COMMENT . 
The sensitive nature of the [MISC Additional Protocol  ] issue was highlighted at the international non-proliferation conference in [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] that [PER Amb  ] . 
[PER Burk  ] attended after her meetings in [LOC Brasilia  ] . 
In response to a blunt challenge from speaker [PER Pierre Goldschmidt  ] that [LOC Brazil  ] sign an [MISC Additional Protocol  ] , a series of agitated [MISC Brazilian  ] attendees responded in nationalistic terms , including likening such a step to " " unilateral capitulation " " to the nuclear weapons states . 
These [MISC Brazilians  ] expressed the view that this measure signaled a profound lack of trust in [LOC Brazil  ] - even though the [MISC Brazilian  ] constitution explicitly prohibits nuclear weapons - and also pointed to the imbalance in the efforts on disarmament compared to those on non-proliferation under the NPT . 
Former Deputy Minister of [ORG External Relations  ] , Ambassador [PER Marcos de Azambuja  ] , voiced concern about the pressure on [LOC Brazil  ] to sign an [MISC Additional Protocol  ] . 
Later , on the margins of the conference , [PER Amb  ] . 
[PER Azambuja  ] came to [PER Amb  ] . 
[PER Burk  ] to tell her in cnfidence that the [ORG GOB  ] will eventually sign an [MISC Addtional Protocol  ] . 
END COMMENT. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) On fuel anks , [PER Amb  ] . 
[PER Burk  ] said that the [ORG USG  ] believes that thy can help . 
The likely increase in demand for nclear fuel shouldn't mean that every country nees to or should produce its own fuel . 
U/S Machadosaid that the [ORG GOB  ] still has the fuel banks proposas under consideration . 
However , they still had questions about the political and economic aspects of the various proposals . 
( NOTE: In [LOC REFTEL B  ] , [ORG Ministry of External Relations  ] staff voiced concerns about possibly restricting a country 's right to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and also about under what criteria a country could draw on such a fuel bank . 
END NOTE . 
) <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) U/S [PER Machado  ] wanted to know more about the [ORG Nuclear Security Summit  ] convoked by President [PER Obama  ] . 
She wondered how it related to the 2010 NPT RevCon . 
[PER Amb  ] . 
[PER Burk  ] explained that the [ORG Nuclear Security Summit  ] is a separate event ( non-NPT parties will participate ) , but it is a complement to the [ORG RevCon  ] . 
[PER Machado  ] wondered about how [LOC India  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] could be inserted into the NPT . 
[PER Burk  ] indicated that we can't realistically see them joining as non-weapons states in the foreseeable future , however , we should be attempting to get them closer to the non-proliferation norms. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) U/S [PER Machado  ] raised [LOC Iran  ] and asked for an update on the negotiations with [LOC Iran  ] to ship processed uranium to the [ORG IAEA  ] for processing into fuel for [LOC Iran  ] 's research reactor . 
She said the [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] was coming to [LOC Brazil  ] and that she expected President [PER Lula  ] to encourage [LOC Iran  ] to take confidence building measures . 
She commented that [PER Lula  ] and [PER Ahmadinejad  ] have a good chemistry and that he listens to [PER Lula  ] . 
Further , she added that [PER Lula  ] was pressing [LOC Iran  ] to stop demonizing the other parties . 
[PER Machado  ] said that in the last ten years [LOC Iran  ] hasn't been following the rules and needs to work to rebuild international confidence in its nuclear program . 
CAUTIOUS RESPONSE FROM DEFENSE MINISTRY <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) At the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] , [PER Amb  ] . 
[PER Burk  ] met with the Director of the [ORG International Affairs Department  ] , [ORG Air Force Lt. General  ] [PER Marcelo Mario de (  ] [PER Holanda  ] ) [ORG Coutinho  ] , and his team of advisors . 
Specifically about the [ORG REVCON  ] , [PER Holanda  ] said that the [ORG GOB  ] supports progress on all three pillars of the NPT . 
He added that the [LOC United States  ] has an ally in [LOC Brazil  ] on non-proliferation matters . 
The [ORG GOB  ] was ready to cooperate and try to advance non-proliferation matters . 
[PER Holanda  ] stressed that the [ORG Defense Ministry  ] was part of the interagency group that handled nuclear matters , but that the [ORG Ministry of External Relations  ] had the lead and spoke for the [ORG GOB  ] at international organizations . 
He added that he and his team were technical experts , and that decisions were made above him at the political level . 
He noted that the technical experts in the [ORG GOB  ] had a difficult time obtaining political level buy-in on non-proliferation matters , especially when the political leaders viewed the matters as penalizing [LOC Brazil  ] . 
( COMMENT . 
He presumably was alluding to the [ORG GOB  ] signing an [MISC Additional Protocol  ] and/or supporting nuclear fuel banks . 
END COMMENT . 
) <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Gen. [PER Holanda  ] took a broad brush to [LOC Brazil  ] 's nuclear history , though he skipped over the darker parts where the [ORG GOB  ] has a weapons [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001320 003 OF 004 program during the military dictatorship . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is a leader on non-proliferation , he stressed , pointing to the [MISC Brazilian  ] constitution which prohibits nuclear weapons , the long record of inspections under the [MISC Argentine-Brazil  ] entity called [ORG ABACC  ] , and [LOC Brazil  ] 's signing in 1967 the Treaty for the [ORG Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons  ] in [LOC Latin America  ] and the [LOC Caribbean  ] ( commonly called the Treaty of [LOC Tlatelolco  ] ) . 
He brought up recent remarks by Vice President [PER Jose Alencar  ] indicating that [LOC Brazil  ] would be better off with nuclear weapons , and emphasized that these comments should be ignored and certainly are contrary to the [ORG GOB  ] 's policy . 
He shrugged off [PER Alencar  ] 's remarks as mere loose talk by a politician , who sometimes say whatever comes to mind. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Gen. [PER Holanda  ] said that [LOC Brazil  ] was determined to expand and develop its nuclear energy sector and this was reflected in the 2008 [ORG National Defense Strategy  ] . 
While supportive of non-proliferation efforts in general , the [ORG GOB  ] would not accept measures that would " " penalize " " [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[PER Holanda  ] emphasized that given its excellent non-proliferation record , [LOC Brazil  ] deserves differential treatment . 
The [ORG GOB  ] would not accept measures that would " " close the door " " on its ability to expand its peaceful use of nuclear energy sector , he underscored . 
For [PER Holanda  ] , it was hard to reconcile the treatment of [LOC India  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] , which didn't respect international regimes , and the treatment intended for [LOC Brazil  ] . 
While on the theme of [LOC Brazil  ] being penalized , [PER Holanda  ] said that the [ORG USG  ] in the past had " " penalized " " [LOC Brazil  ] by prohibiting the sale of [MISC Super Tucano  ] aircraft ( which contained [LOC U.S.  ] sensitive technology ) to [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
COMMENT <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Amb  ] . 
[PER Burk  ] 's meetings with the [ORG Ministry of External Relations  ] and the [ORG Defense Ministry  ] were positive and served to encourage greater cooperation by [LOC Brazil  ] . 
While not ignoring the sensitive issues of the Additional Protocol and nuclear fuel banks , there was a focus on the bigger picture of strengthening the NPT and advancing all three pillars . 
This message resonated very well with [MISC Brazilian  ] interlocutors . 
END COMMENT . 
REVISITING SOME FAMILIAR THEMES IN RIO <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Amb . 
[PER Burk  ] travelled to [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] to provide the keynote address to the first major international nonproliferation conference sponsored by [ORG Centro Brasileiro De Relacoes Internacionais  ] ( [ORG CEBRI  ] ) and the [MISC Argentina-based  ] Nonproliferacion para la [ORG Seguridad Global  ] ( [ORG NPS Global  ] ) . 
The two day event , entitled , " " [ORG Nonproliferation and Nuclear Disarmament:  ] The Future of the [ORG NPT  ] " " featured 5 panels addressing the three pillars of the [MISC Treaty-  ] nonproliferation disarmament and peaceful use , as well as discussions on its usefulness and effectiveness as the cornerstone of the nonproliferation regime. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Presentations and remarks were provided by regulars in the nonproliferation community , such as [PER Rebecca Johnson  ] of the [ORG UK-based Acronym Institute  ] ; [PER Vladimir Orlov  ] of the [MISC Russian-based  ] [ORG PIR Center  ] ; [PER Sergio Duarte  ] , the [ORG UN  ] High Commissioner for Disarmament ; [PER Rolf Ekeus  ] , formerly with [ORG UNSCOM  ] ; [PER Pierre Goldschmidt  ] of [ORG Carnegie Endowment for International Peace  ] ; and [PER Olli Heinonen  ] , the head of safeguards at the [ORG IAEA  ] ; and [PER Gareth Evans  ] , head of the [ORG International Nonproliferation and Disarmament Commission  ] . 
[PER Joseph Cirincione  ] of the [ORG Ploughshares Fund  ] , another fixture , was sponsored by the [ORG Rio Consulate  ] , and provided a dynamic and well-received multi-media presentation on the " " Transformation of [ORG American Nuclear Policy  ] , " " explaining some of the changes and challenges of the [ORG Obama Administration.  ] <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The conference featured a distinctly [MISC Latin American  ] flavor , highlighting presentations by several key diplomats from the region including [PER Alfredo Labbe  ] of [LOC Chile  ] , as well as [PER Rafael Grossi  ] and [PER Gustavo Ainchil  ] of [LOC Argentina  ] . 
In his remarks , [PER Labbe  ] advocated for the [ORG AP  ] and international fuel assurances , noting that [LOC Chile  ] has no need for a nuclear program , however requires access to nuclear energy and fuel . 
He stressed the criticality of investing in an incentives based approach to creating a fuel bank , noting that " " peaceful uses will remain after all nonproliferation and disarmament objectives have been reached " " . 
[PER Grossi  ] highlighted the success of the regional safeguards organization [ORG ABACC  ] , and the role of [LOC Latin America  ] as a leader on nonproliferation and disarmament , suggesting [LOC Argentina  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] should be a model by " " giving the world a wonderful idea of how to do things . 
" " <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In a panel on disarmament , [PER B.S. Prakash  ] , [MISC Indian  ] Ambassador to [LOC Brazil  ] , emphasized that [LOC India  ] " " has always agreed in a world without nuclear weapons " " but does not believe in the [ORG NPT  ] . 
He explained that by not joining the [LOC NPT  ] , [LOC India  ] has endured enormous costs , however not because of its proliferation activities . 
He asserted [LOC India  ] was responsible player on disarmament because of its interest in a nuclear weapons convention and an FMCT , as well as its unilateral moratorium on testing . 
[PER Vladimir Orlov  ] , also on the panel , chided [PER Prakash  ] , noting that to demonstrate progress on disarmament , [LOC India  ] should be more in line with the [MISC P5  ] , and should act as an [ORG NPT  ] party. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The penultimate event of the conference was a provocative panel chaired by [PER Gareth Evans  ] , examining whether the [ORG NPT  ] should improved or substituted , perhaps with an alternate regime . 
[PER Evans  ] expressed his support for the current regime and discussed his highly anticipated report , in which his 20-point plan will be " " idealistic but realistic ; ambitious but pragmatic . 
" " He acknowledged the role for a nuclear weapons convention , an alternative regime suggested by another speaker , explaining that such an agreement should not supplant the [ORG NPT  ] , at least in the near term . 
[PER Pierre Goldschmidt  ] , another panel participant and former [ORG IAEA  ] head of safeguards , asserted that the [ORG NPT  ] should be fully implemented and enforced , stressing the role of the [ORG IAEA  ] and the Additional Protocol . 
He explained that only six countries with significant nuclear activities had not signed the Additional Protocol , singling out [LOC Argentina  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] . 
He explained that without an Additional Protocol , [LOC Brazil  ] was indirectly supporting noncompliant countries like [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Syria  ] . 
He claimed that [LOC Brazil  ] 's constitution , which forbids the development of nuclear weapons , does not provide adequate assurance to the international community , and went on to quote several unpopular [MISC Brazilian  ] politicians to indicate [LOC Brazil  ] may have intentions otherwise . 
These suggestions prompted a strong reaction from participants , with [PER Sergio Duarte  ] and Ambassador [PER Marcos  ] de [PER Azambuja  ] , the head of [ORG CEBRI  ] , jumping into the discussion to defend [LOC Brazil  ] 's record . 
[PER Marcos  ] de [PER Azambuja  ] explained that he supported the Additional Protocol , but [LOC Brazil  ] viewed it as a concession , and was " " holding out " " on behalf of all [MISC Non-Nuclear Weapons States  ] , though he could not specify what for . 
ENDING ON A HIGH NOTE <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( U ) The conference concluded with a keynote address by Amb . 
[PER Burk  ] in which she outlined the [ORG USG  ] 's agenda for strengthening the nonproliferation regime , and her thoughts for a successful 2010 [ORG NPT Review Conference  ] . 
She acknowldged [LOC Brazil  ] as a model for a country that has steered away from nuclear weapons and has instead pursued a path towards using nuclear energy . 
In her remarks , [PER Burk  ] underscored the importance of a balanced review of all three pillars of the [ORG NPT  ] , the concept of reciprocal responsibilities , and the need for [MISC States Parties  ] to constructively approach the [ORG Review Conference  ] as an opportunity to provide momentum to other related efforts and fora . 
The positive and encouraging message she delivered , contrasted sharply with the tone of the previous panel , was well-received and gave further boost to perception that the [LOC United States  ] strives to be a constructive player in multilateral fora .
