Alsace  ] for reasons 1.5 ( b ) and ( d ) . ------ Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [ORG Secretariat General of the Presidency  ] Minister [PER Viera Gallo  ] told the Ambassador January 30 that the [ORG GOC  ] - and [MISC Chilean  ] society - are only belatedly taking seriously a growing problem with [LOC Chile  ] 's indigenous ( largely [MISC Mapuche  ] ) population , which has never been fully integrated and is becoming increasingly radicalized . 
Mapuche alienation and protest activity could impact on issues such as terrorism , energy , and development in environmentally sensitive regions . 
[LOC Chile  ] 's energy shortage was the country 's " biggest problem " in the near term , although [LOC Chile  ] was also struggling with issues arising out of modernization and globalization , with youth and women seeking their place in an evolving [MISC Chilean  ] society . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Ambassador [PER Simons  ] paid a courtesy call January 30 on Minister of the [ORG Secretariat General of the Presidency  ] ( SEGPRES ) [PER Jose Antonio Viera-Gallo  ] , whose ministry is responsible for coordinating relations between the [LOC Presidency  ] and three sets of key political actors: the four parties of the center-left governing Concertacion coalition , the center-right opposition , and the [ORG Congress  ] . 
The Ambassador was accompanied by E/Pol Counselor. ------------------------------------------- An Increasingly Vocal Indigenous Population ------------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) After opening pleasantries - [PER Viera Gallo  ] noted that since [LOC Chile  ] 's return to democracy relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] have been very good across the board - the Minister was briefly interrupted by two phone calls . 
The second was from President [PER Bachelet  ] and the short conversation ( topic unclear ) was notable for its formality , with no apparent warmth , ( [MISC Comment: This  ] tracks with the common view that [LOC Veira-Gallo  ] , a political operative , was brought into the cabinet as a " fixer " and not because he is in [PER Bachelet  ] 's inner circle . 
) The first call was from [PER Archbishop Goic  ] , who has been serving as an intermediary between the [ORG GOC  ] and hunger-striker [PER Patricia Troncoso  ] , who has been protesting her incarceration , the result of her involvement in the torching of a rural farm , located on land that the [ORG Mapuche  ] indigenous population claim was stolen from them . 
The accord has been front page news and the government has taken some heat for bowing to [PER Troncoso  ] 's demands , but also for failing to take seriously the " [ORG Mapuche  ] issue . 
" As a result , [PER Bachelet  ] recently named a " Presidential Commissioner " to head a panel to review how the [ORG GOC  ] is dealing with the long-simmering complaints of the indigenous population ( septel ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Viera-Gallo  ] agreed with E/Pol Counselor that the issue cut across several lines , including terrorism , energy , and development . 
The Minister noted that several [ORG Mapuche  ] had ties to the [MISC Basques  ] , including possibly to the [ORG ETA  ] . 
They are involved in protests against construction of dams that would produce hydro-electric power , impacting [LOC Chile  ] 's energy needs . 
[ORG Mapuche  ] are linked to [ORG NGO  ] 's opposed to development in lands both claimed by the [ORG Mapuche  ] and which are also environmentally sensitive . 
Nonetheless , [PER Viera-Gallo  ] continued , the [ORG Mapuche  ] have legitimate concerns . 
Both moderates and extremists , with some justification , view themselves as having been " mistreated by [LOC Chile  ] . 
" While essentially a conservative people ( " they vote for the right " ) they also have respect for the environment and are a matriarchical society . 
Many are well-educated with strong ties to similar indigenous or ethnic groups , including in [LOC Europe  ] . 
There is developing a significant divide between young , more radical [ORG Mapuche  ] , and older leaders who have demands but will accept accommodation within the [MISC Chilean  ] state . 
The younger leadership seeks a separate [ORG Mapuche  ] entity. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Viera-Gallo  ] , who clearly evidenced sympathy for the [ORG Mapuche  ] , said they had not been integrated " at all " into [MISC Chilean  ] society . 
[MISC Chileans  ] , especially the upper class which identifies with [LOC Chile  ] 's [MISC European  ] pretensions , have to accept that the [ORG Mapuche  ] , and other smaller indigenous groups , are also a part of [LOC Chile  ] 's make-up . 
The [ORG Mapuche  ] have have made some inroads in this respect , reaching out successfully to younger non-Mapuche [MISC Chileans  ] sympathetic to their cause . 
The Catholic Church is also increasingly involved with indigenous concerns. ----------------- An Energy Deficit ----------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Viera-Gallo  ] didn't hesitate when asked by the Ambassador to enumerate the administration 's challenges: " Energy is our biggest problem . 
" Domestic production and supply from outside sources , such as [LOC Argentina  ] , have not kept pace with surging economic growth . 
[LOC Chile  ] will face " serious restrictions " in the upcoming winter months . 
Construction of dams ( hydro ) is critical but faces obstacles from indigenous and environmental groups . 
The potential for developing geothermal power in [LOC Chile  ] 's north ( " we are talking to the [MISC Italians  ] " ) is also hostage to indigenous groups in that region , who are concerned about associated water rights and shortages . 
[PER Viera-Gallo  ] said prospects would improve in 2009 , when LNG plant facilities would come on line . 
The Ambassador noted that President [PER Bachelet  ] had asked him , at presentation of credentials , to find ways to enhance [MISC U.S.-Chile  ] cooperation on energy . 
He had met across a wide range of private and public energy experts and policymakers during his first six weeks in country and would return to [LOC Washington  ] in February to work on next steps. ------------------------------ The Challenge of Modernization ------------------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Turning to other challenges facing [LOC Chile  ] , a reflective [PER Viera-Gallo  ] worried about disaffected youth disengaged from politics , " fatigued " with parliament and political parties , although he stressed this was not yet a crisis . 
Still , [MISC Chileans  ] generally were dealing with the cultural dislocations attendant on modernization , including rampant consumerism ( " the mall culture " ) and a sense that life was overly complicated . 
Yet all [MISC Chileans  ] felt they they had to adapt and keep up , he continued , noting that in his visits to rural areas , he was struck by the modern appliances found even in the most humble homes . 
Educational levels were on the increase with more college students , but job prospects for those with university degrees poor ( " PhD 's driving taxis " ) . 
Women are also facing change ; as they are increasingly educated they are leaving rural areas behind , seeking jobs in urban areas . 
[LOC Chile  ] is also welcoming foreign labor for the first time in its history , with large numbers of [MISC Peruvians  ] entering the agricultural labor force . 
These changes are fearful for many in [MISC Chilean  ] society . 
The Ambassador noted that [LOC U.S.  ] society continues to face many of the same challenges [PER Viera-Gallo  ] had outlined. --------------------------- HDTV , IPR , Loss of Majority --------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ambassador noted pending intellectual property legislation in the [MISC Chilean  ] [ORG Senate  ] , adding that the Embassy continued to work closely with the [ORG GOC  ] and USTR to find ways to address our concerns with the proposed law . 
He also made a pitch for [ORG ATSC  ] , the [MISC U.S.-backed  ] digital television standard , noting the lower cost for [MISC Chilean  ] consumers . 
[PER Viera-Gallo  ] agreed it was important for the [ORG GOC  ] to make the right choice on digital TV . 
Asked whether the loss of the governing coalition 's working majority in both houses of parliament would affect the administration 's ability to pursue its agenda , [PER Viera-Gallo  ] shrugged: " It 's not really a problem ; Concertacion has rarely had a majority but still worked solutions . 
" <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) Bio [PER Note: Viera-Gallo  ] said he had two daughters living in [LOC Brooklyn  ] . 
The first , thirty years old , is an artist , married to an architect . 
She has a studio and has exhibited in [LOC New York  ] , [LOC Los Angeles  ] , and [LOC Chile  ] . 
The second , younger , is a writer , recently divorced from a well known [MISC Chilean  ] artist ( [PER Ivan Navarro  ] ) who , [PER Viera-Gallo  ] lamented jokingly , is " making it big " after the divorce. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) That much of the meeting was devoted to the [ORG Mapuche  ] issue is evidence that [LOC Chile  ] , which has long ignored its indigenous population , cannot escape dealing with yet another offshoot of globalization , in this case the rising awareness of the [ORG Mapuche  ] that their concerns are similar to those of other indigenous or ethnic minority groups , are at least as legitimate , and need be addressed by the government . 
The danger lies in radicalization of the issue , potential ties to extremist or even terrorist groups , and the use of violence to push an agenda . 
Post will be following this issue closely in the near term , including proposing how the [ORG USG  ] might be of assistance to the [ORG GOC  ] both through intelligence sharing but also promoting dialogue and finding solutions . 
End comment .
