End summary . 
[PER Solzhenitsyn  ] on [ORG Town Hall Democracy  ] , [PER Medvedev  ] , [LOC Kosovo  ] , [LOC Ukraine  ] and [ORG NATO  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In a recent meeting , writer [PER Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn  ] received the Ambassador at his home outside [LOC Moscow  ] . 
[PER Solzhenitsyn  ] , who will turn 90 this December has been in declining health for some time . 
A stroke has left his left arm paralyzed and his hand gnarled , but Solzhenitsyn’s legendary energy was undiminished , and he was alert , spoke clearly , and , as the conversation showed , actively engaged with the events of the day . 
With [PER Solzhenitsyn  ] was his wife [PER Natalya  ] , who followed the conversation carefully , and did not hesitate to contradict her husband when she thought it necessary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) As he had in a 2007 Der Spiegel interview , [PER Solzhenitsyn  ] positively contrasted the eight-year reign of [PER Putin  ] with those of [PER Gorbachev  ] and [PER Yeltsin  ] , which he said had “added to the damage done to the [MISC Russian  ] state by seventy years of [MISC Communist  ] rule.” Under [PER Putin  ] , the nation was re-discovering what it was to be [MISC Russian  ] , [PER Solzhenitsyn  ] thought , although he acknowledged that many problems remained ; among them poverty and the widening gap between rich and poor. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Solzhenitsyn  ] enthusiastically told the Ambassador of the need to develop grassroots democracy through instruments of local self-government . 
Recalling his time in the [LOC United States  ] , [PER Solzhenitsyn  ] called the [LOC Vermont  ] town hall meetings he had witnessed the “essence of democracy.” Putin’s decision , following [LOC Beslan  ] , to have governors appointed instead of elected had been a “mistake , ” [PER Solzhenitsyn  ] thought . 
He also dismissed the on-again , off-again conversations in [LOC Russia  ] about the need to construct a genuine party system as “irrelevant.” [PER Solzhenitsyn  ] thought it was necessary to elect officials directly , so that they could be held accountable for their actions. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) President-elect [PER Medvedev  ] struck [PER Solzhenitsyn  ] as a “nice , young man.” [PER Solzhenitsyn  ] had not met him , but he guessed he was up to the “enormous challenge of repairing the damage done to [MISC Russian  ] citizens during the [MISC Soviet  ] period.” His reference to the [MISC Soviet  ] period caused [PER Solzhenitsyn  ] to worry that young [MISC Russians  ] did not sufficiently appreciate the dangers of [MISC Soviet  ] communism . 
It was essential , as well , that [LOC Russia  ] re-assure the former [MISC Soviet  ] states that it fully appreciated how “deformed” the [MISC Soviet  ] system was , and was aware of the crimes , like the [ORG Holodomor  ] , it had committed against [MISC Soviet  ] citizens . 
( Note: on April 2 , [PER Solzhenitsyn  ] joined the debate here about the famine in [LOC Ukraine  ] in a brief article published in [ORG Izvestiya  ] . 
In it , he recalls the 1921 famine that stalked the [ORG Urals  ] and rejects the notion that the 1932 - 1933 famine was a an act of “genocide” against the [MISC Ukrainian  ] people . 
Solzhenitsyn’s article sparked a mini-controversy here , with Father [PER Gleb Yakunin  ] taking [PER Solzhenitsyn  ] to task for “attacking the first [LOC CIS  ] state that condemned the communist genocide.” ) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Solzhenitsyn  ] repeated to the Ambassador his objection to independence for [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
Why , he asked rhetorically , should the [MISC Serbs  ] be held responsible for the sins of [PER Milosevic  ] ? 
He was critical of plans to move [LOC Ukraine  ] closer to [ORG NATO  ] , although he didn’t belabor the point . 
The more significant moment , he thought , was the reaction of the [LOC United States  ] after 9/11 , when [PER Putin  ] attempted to extend a helping hand . 
He cooperated in paving the way for [LOC U.S.  ] bases in [LOC Central Asia  ] and joined other foreign leaders in extending [MISC Russia’s  ] condolences to the [MISC American  ] people . 
[PER Solzhenitsyn  ] hoped for a time when that spontaneous gesture by [PER Putin  ] would be fully reciprocated. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Solzhenitsyn  ] told the Ambassador that he continues to work actively in the archives , and it was clear from the topical references sprinkled throughout his conversation that he followed current events actively . 
[PER Kirill  ] on Ecumenicalism , [PER Medvedev  ] , the [ORG Hazards of Prosperity  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) In a separate meeting , [PER Metropolitan Kirill  ] re-visited themes he had touched on in the media and in earlier conversations with Ambassador . 
[PER Kirill  ] seemed to be in good health was preoccupied as always with the , in his view , excessive emphasis on the individual in the [LOC West  ] , and stressed the need to harmonize traditional human rights concerns with “morality and ethics.” Economic progress had been a two-edged sword for [LOC Russia  ] , [PER Kirill  ] thought . 
With prosperity , [MISC Russians  ] had “lost something” and [PER Kirill  ] , who is [PER Metropolitan  ] of [LOC Smolensk  ] and [LOC Kaliningrad  ] , pointed to less prosperous [LOC Smolensk  ] as “better preserved” than [LOC Moscow  ] or [LOC St. Petersburg.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Kirill  ] spoke highly of a [MISC UN-sponsored  ] effort to bridge the gap between [PER East  ] and [LOC West  ] by seeking an alliance of civilizations . 
[PER Kirill  ] was attempting to interest the [ORG UN  ] in his efforts to sponsor ecumenical dialogue especially , he said , in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
As he has in past conversations , [PER Kirill  ] contrasted [MISC Roman Catholic  ] [PER Pope Benedict  ] favorably with his predecessor [PER John Paul II  ] , and again held out the prospect of significant improvement in [MISC Russian  ] Orthodox - [MISC Roman Catholic  ] relations . 
Also on the ecumenical front , [PER Kirill  ] reported to the Ambassador efforts , via the [MISC Russian  ] Orthodox Church of [LOC America  ] and the [ORG National Council of Churches  ] to reach out to [MISC Protestant  ] denominations in the [LOC U.S.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Kirill  ] joined [PER Solzhenitsyn  ] in identifying enduring poverty as one of the chief challenges that President [PER Medvedev  ] will face . 
He called poverty as a by-product of corruption and red tape which were “stumbling blocks” to progress in [LOC Russia  ] . 
[PER Kirill  ] , who unlike [PER Solzhenitsyn  ] has had a number of direct conversations , was optimistic that the President-elect was equal to the tasks ahead , and predicted that he would concentrate on [MISC Russia’s  ] many socio-economic problems. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) While [PER Kirill  ] largely echoed Solzhenitsyn’s arguments against [LOC Kosovo  ] independence , he was even sharper than [PER Solzhenitsyn  ] about [ORG NATO  ] expansion . 
[LOC Ukraine  ] was “not ready , ” and [ORG NATO  ] membership could cause a split in that country’s population , and created turmoil in [LOC Eastern Europe  ] , he maintained .
