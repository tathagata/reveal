She is the main suspect in the [MISC USD  ] one billion fraud that allegedly involved money laundering for various [MISC Islamic  ] extremist groups . 
[PER Koleilat  ] was arrested in the [ORG Parthenon Accor Hotel  ] in the [LOC Santana  ] district of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] based on an anonymous tip . 
She had a [MISC British  ] passport ( suspected to be fake ) with her real name , as well an [MISC Egyptian  ] passport with the name [PER Fakhriya Mhanna  ] . 
A Civil Police spokesman told the press that [PER Koleilat  ] tried to bribe [MISC Brazilian  ] police with [MISC USD  ] 200,000 in an unsuccessful attempt to release her . 
[MISC Lebanese  ] Consul General in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] [PER Joseph Sayah  ] told us that she has apparently been in [LOC Brazil  ] for six months ( including in [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] and other cities ) and is in an illegal immigration status in [LOC Brazil  ] since she had overstayed her initial entry permit , even if the passport she used turns out to be real . 
[PER Sayah  ] also told us that the [ORG UN Independent International Investigation Commission  ] set up to look into the February 2005 assassination of [MISC Lebanese  ] Prime Minister [PER Rafik Hariri  ] wants to question her with regard to the assassination , since [ORG Syrian Military Intelligence  ] Chief [PER Rustom Ghazaleh  ] , the chief suspect in the [PER Hariri  ] assassination , was heavily involved in the [ORG Al-Madina Bank  ] 's money laundering scheme. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 .

While [MISC Lebanese  ] CG [PER Sayah  ] confirmed that [LOC Lebanon  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] do not have an extradition treaty , both [PER Sayah  ] and Civil Police contacts told us they expect [PER Koleilat  ] will be deported to [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
He added that he has seen [PER Koleilat  ] in custody and that she seems willing to return to [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
[PER Sayah  ] told us the [ORG UN Investigation Commission  ] is aware of [PER Koleilat  ] 's arrest and has communicated to the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Mission  ] at the [ORG UN  ] their request to interrogate her . 
[PER Sayah  ] asserted that all [ORG UN  ] member countries , like [LOC Brazil  ] , are obligated to assist the [ORG Commission.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Sayah  ] , initially concerned that [PER Koleilat  ] would bribe her way to freedom , seems more confident she will stay in jail for now . 
Post has let various police contacts know our interest in keeping her detained until she can be removed to [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
RSO is working via channels to ensure [ORG Interpol  ] and the [MISC British  ] Consulate act quickly to provide [MISC Brazilian  ] police with whatever they need to move the case forward. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Action Request: [ORG Mission Brazil  ] requests guidance from the [ORG Department on  ] any actions to be taken with regard to the [PER Koleilat  ] case .
