<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 [LOC MADRID  ] 004063 SIPDIS E.O. 12958: [LOC DECL:  ] 10/15/2014 TAGS: <a href='/tag/PREL_0.html'>PREL</a> <a href='/tag/PGOV_0.html'>PGOV</a> <a href='/tag/SP_0.html'>SP</a> SUBJECT: DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER REGRETS UNHELPFUL MOD COMMENTS , SEEKS TO PUT RELATIONS BACK ON TRACK REF: EMBASSY MADRID E-MAIL TO EUR/WE OF OCTOBER 14 [ORG Classified By: Political Counselor Kathleen  ] [PER M. Fitzpatrick  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) DFM [PER Leon  ] Agrees that [PER Bono  ] 's Comments Were Unhelpful <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Deputy Foreign Minister [PER Bernardino Leon  ] told [ORG DCM Manzanares  ] Oct. 14 that he agreed that [PER DefMin Bono  ] 's comments last week about [MISC US-Spain  ] relations and the [LOC US  ] role in the [MISC Spanish National Day  ] Parade were extremely unhelpful . 
[PER Leon  ] promised there would be no further comments from President [PER Zapatero  ] that could be construed as anti-American , but that [PER Bono  ] was hard to control ( note: [PER Bono  ] is a skilled politician who loves publicity and is known for his long-winded public comments ) . 
[PER Leon  ] said , however , that the Ambassador 's non-attendance at the King 's [MISC National Day  ] reception -- however taken out of context by the press -- had struck a difficult chord in the government . 
[ORG DCM Confirms  ] Ambassador Had No Intention of Snubbing the King <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG Manzanares  ] responded that the Ambassador had no intention to snub the King or the [MISC Spanish  ] people , and had in fact spoken with the King who was understanding of the Ambassador 's difficulty in attending the reception as well as the Ambassador 's prior decision , known to the [ORG GOS  ] , not to attend the [MISC National Day  ] parade . 
[PER Manzanares  ] told [PER Leon  ] that comments from senior government officials that put the issue in the most negative light possible were very unhelpful , and reached [LOC Washington  ] just as fast as they reached the press in [LOC Madrid  ] . 
[PER Manzanares  ] said the perception both in [LOC Madrid  ] and [LOC Washington  ] is that the current government exhibits very strong anti-Americanism , though we do not think that it is the intent of the government to portray itself in this way. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Leon  ] said that there exists in [LOC Spain  ] not so much anti-Americanism per se , but a broad anti-Bush administration sentiment , focused not on personalities but on policy . 
[PER Manzanares  ] asked [PER Leon  ] how the [PER Zapatero  ] government planned to put itself right with either a new [PER Bush  ] administration or a [PER Kerry  ] administration , noting that democracies need to come to terms with one another no matter which government was in power . 
[LOC U.S.  ] Policies Post-Election <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Manzanares  ] noted that even if another party wins the [LOC U.S.  ] election , most of our foreign policy challenges - [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , counter-terrorism , etc. will remain the same , so that the [MISC Spanish  ] government needs to come to terms with this and find ways to put the relationship back on track . 
[PER Leon  ] said that the [LOC U.S.  ] should look at [LOC Spain  ] 's actions more than recent words . 
For example , [PER Leon  ] said that [LOC Spain  ] sent over 1000 troops to [LOC Afghanistan  ] -- a large deployment for [LOC Spain  ] -- as a sign of goodwill toward the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Manzanares  ] replied that we very much appreciated [LOC Spain  ] 's participation in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , but there need to be more signals . 
[PER Leon  ] promised there would be other such signs . 
[PER Manzanares  ] noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] was not concerned about [LOC Spain  ] 's desire to move toward what [LOC Spain  ] saw as the " heart of [LOC Europe  ] . 
" The [LOC U.S.  ] believes [MISC Europeans  ] can remain close to the [LOC U.S.  ] as well as their [MISC European  ] counterparts . 
[PER Leon Offers  ] to Publicly Stress [ORG U.S.-Spain Cooperation  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) What we object to , [PER Manzanares  ] continued , is being the " political football " [LOC Spain  ] uses as it seeks to reinforce its [MISC European  ] policy . 
" Anti-Americanism is not a foreign policy , " [PER Manzanares  ] said . 
[PER Leon  ] agreed , and asked if it would be helpful if he would draft a public statement ( or op/ed ) highlighting the importance of [MISC U.S.-Spanish  ] cooperation . 
[PER Manzanares  ] said that would be very helpful and would welcome the idea of such a piece by the [MISC Spanish  ] government . 
[LOC U.S.  ] Has [LOC Been Patient  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Reviewing relations since the March 14 elections , [PER Manzanares  ] underscored that the [LOC US  ] had been very patient and mature these last few months . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] has refrained from responding to aggressive anti-US rhetoric as we looked for the new government to settle in , become more experienced and as we ourselves focused on our longer-term interests in [LOC Spain  ] . 
Continued anti-U.S. rhetoric from high [ORG GOS  ] levels , however , was forcing us to reconsider this restraint and respond more aggressively . 
[PER Leon  ] said he understood and hoped that this would not be necessary . 
Returning to the theme of [PER Zapatero  ] 's comments , such as those in [LOC Tunis  ] several weeks ago , [PER Manzanares  ] asked [PER Leon  ] why [PER Zapatero  ] had not taken the opportunity to retract his statements after Secretary [PER Powell  ] had spoken to FM Moratinos . 
[PER Leon  ] said that [PER Zapatero  ] had not intended the remarks the way they were taken and pointed to comments [PER Zapatero  ] had made in [LOC Bilbao  ] the following day as being pro-American . 
[PER Manzanares  ] pointed out that we had not seen these comments in [LOC Bilbao  ] and they were not highlighted in the press here . 
Other issues: <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Cuba: Leon  ] said the [ORG GOS  ] did not want a wholesale change in the [ORG EU  ] policy toward [LOC Cuba  ] , but rather to modify it somewhat to allow [ORG EU  ] Ambassadors and diplomats access to [PER Castro  ] and other [MISC Cuban  ] officials in order to press home the need for reform . 
[PER Leon  ] underscored there were no personal relations with [PER Castro  ] among members of the Socialist government in the way that existed during the previous Socialist government under [PER Felipe Gonzalez  ] . 
[PER Leon  ] said if the other [MISC Europeans  ] did not agree with [LOC Spain  ] on the [LOC Cuba  ] issue , [LOC Spain  ] would not adopt a unilateral policy. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [LOC Western Sahara:  ] [PER Leon  ] noted the excellent meeting he had had with [PER A/S Burns  ] several weeks ago in which they discussed [LOC Western Sahara  ] . 
He said that [MISC Spanish  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] positions were relatively the same , and pointed to the [MISC French  ] position -- embodied by [ORG Chirac  ] himself -- as being the problem in finding a way forward . 
[PER Leon  ] characterized [ORG Chirac  ] 's position in support of [LOC Rabat  ] as " stronger than that of the King of [LOC Morocco  ] . 
" He pledged to continue to work with the [ORG USG  ] on the issue .
