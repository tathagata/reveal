( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary: Shell’s Vice President for [LOC Africa  ] , [PER Ann Pickard  ] ( strictly protect ) , said a September 13 attack on a [ORG Shell  ] natural gas node in [LOC Rivers State  ] may impact the supply of gas to [MISC Nigerian  ] Liquefied [ORG Natural Gas  ] ( [ORG NLNG  ] ) plant , but she downplayed the impact of recent attacks on Shell’s current oil production . 
She claimed [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] were behind the militant unrest in [LOC Rivers State  ] and that [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX Rivers State  ] Governor [PER Rotimi Amaechi’s  ] lack of political connections forced him to fight rather than “co-opt” the militants as the [LOC Delta  ] and [ORG Bayelsa State  ] governors have done . 
[PER Pickard  ] asked what the [ORG USG  ] knew about [ORG GAZPROM  ] interest in [LOC Nigeria  ] ; and if we had any information on shipments of one to three surface to air missiles to militant groups in the [LOC Niger Delta  ] . 
She alleged that a conversation with a [MISC Nigerian  ] government official had been secretly recorded by the [MISC Russians  ] . 
Post believes that the spate of recent attacks may have impacted [ORG Shell’s  ] oil production more than [PER Pickard  ] is letting on . 
End Summary . 
[ORG Shell  ] Says Attacks Caused Little Impact to Production --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In a September 18 meeting with Econoffs to discuss the attacks that occurred September 13-16 in [LOC Rivers State  ] , [MISC Shell’s  ] Vice President for [LOC Africa  ] , [PER Ann Pickard  ] , downplayed the impact of attacks on [ORG Shell’s  ] oil production . 
According to [PER Pickard  ] , most of the fields in the area were already shut-in due to pipeline breaks from attacks earlier this summer . 
She was concerned however , that the September 13 attack on [MISC Shell’s Soku  ] gas facility would hamper the delivery of natural gas to [ORG NLNG  ] ( Ref A ) . 
During the attack [ORG Soku  ] was hit by two rocket propelled grenades and [ORG Shell  ] is still assessing the extent of the damage . 
( Note: [PER Pickard  ] remarked that [ORG Shell  ] had received two days advanced warning of an attack from another [ORG USG  ] agency , but the information provided was too vague for [ORG Shell  ] to act upon . 
End Note ) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Pickard  ] also thought she detected a troubling new development in least one of the recent attacks in [LOC Rivers State  ] . 
In previous attacks in the western [LOC Niger Delta  ] , militants had approached facilities via creeks and swamps using boats . 
In one of the attacks on September 14 , militants crossed a significant amount of dry land to reach their target . 
[PER Pickard  ] was unsure if this was a one-off occurrence or a new militant tactic . 
She expressed concern that if the militants were willing to move over long stretches of dry land , oil facilities thought to be secure would be vulnerable to attack . 
On the [MISC JTF’s  ] performance , she noted the [ORG JTF  ] was taking a more proactive approach to confronting the militants and increasing the use of helicopters to attack militant formations . 
[PER Amaechi Lacks  ] Capacity to Co-Opt the Militants --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) Discussing the politics behind the recent events in [LOC Rivers State  ] , [PER Pickard  ] said [LOC Rivers State  ] Governor [PER Rotimi Amaechi  ] lacked the connections among [LOC Rivers State  ] militant leaders to successfully co-opt them as the governors in [LOC Delta  ] and [ORG Bayelsa  ] states have done with militants in their states . 
[PER Amaechi  ] has more groups of militants to deal with than does [LOC Delta State  ] , where Governor [PER Uduaghn  ] has reached an agreement with [PER Tom Polo  ] , or [ORG Bayelsa State  ] , where Governor [PER Silva  ] has reached an agreement with three of five groups . 
( Note: She did remark that [ORG Bayelsa State  ] militant leader , “Boyloaf” was not one of the [ORG Bayelsa  ] militant leaders that had been “settled” . 
End Note . 
) . 
In her view the clash between the [ORG JTF  ] and militants was a proxy war for ongoing disputes between [PER Amaechi  ] and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ( Ref B ) [ORG GAZPROM  ] Making a Play for [ORG Shell’s Concessions in Nigeria  ] ? --------------------------------------------- ------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Pickard  ] asked for [ORG USG  ] information on GAZPROM’s interest in [LOC Nigeria  ] . 
She had heard from contacts in the [MISC British  ] government that the [ORG GON  ] has promised [ORG GAZPROM  ] access to 17 trillion cubic feet of natural gas . 
[PER Pickard  ] said that that amount of gas was only available if the [ORG GON  ] were to take concessions currently assigned to other oil companies and give them to [ORG GAZPROM  ] . 
She assumed [ORG Shell  ] would be the [MISC GON’s  ] prime target . 
She discussed recent press reports of a memorandum of understanding between [ORG GAZPROM  ] and the [ORG Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation  ] and agreed it was likely more flash than substance . 
In an interesting aside , [PER Pickard  ] told Econoffs that she had recently held a meeting with an unnamed [MISC Nigerian  ] minister in the minister’s office . 
Shortly thereafter she said she received a verbatim transcript of the meeting “from [MISC Russia.”  ] ( Comment: [PER Pickard  ] was a little coy on this subject . 
She did not name the minister and it wasn’t clear who gave her the transcript . 
The implication was that the [MISC Russian  ] government was actively collecting on [ORG Shell  ] in [LOC Nigeria  ] as well as one of Nigeria’s ministries . 
[PER Pickard  ] routinely meets with the oil , gas , and defense ministers as well as top military leaders and senior advisors to the President . 
End Comment . 
) [ORG Shell  ] Concerned About MANPADS in [LOC Niger Delta  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In another request for information , [PER Pickard  ] asked if we had any information about possible shipments of “surface to air missiles ( [MISC SAMs  ] ) ” to militants in the [LOC Niger Delta  ] ( Note: Presumably she is referring to man portable air defense systems ( manpads ) and not larger surface to air missile systems . 
End Note . 
) She claimed [ORG Shell  ] has “intelligence” that one to three [MISC SAMs  ] may have been shipped to [MISC Nigerian  ] militant groups , although she seemed somewhat skeptical of that information and wondered if such sensitive systems would last long in the harsh environment of the [LOC Niger Delta  ] in the care of groups not known for their preventive maintenance practices . 
When asked what aviation security steps [ORG Shell  ] was taking , [PER Pickard  ] said [ORG Shell  ] helicopters generally fly above the effective range of the small and medium caliber weapons used by militants. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Comment: In earlier conversations , [PER Pickard  ] has not always been forthcoming on oil production levels . 
Government spokesmen and other oil executives tell us [LOC Nigeria  ] lost between 150-200,000 barrels per day of oil production because of the recent attacks in [LOC Rivers State  ] . 
[ORG Chevron  ] admits it lost 30,000 barrels of production . 
Which company then lost the other 120-170,000 barrels ? 
The [MISC European  ] oil companies have fields in [LOC Rivers  ] and share pipelines with [ORG Shell  ] , so it is possible that damaged [ORG Shell  ] pipelines have cut off those fields . 
However , [ORG Chevron  ] contacts have told us they believe eight [ORG Shell  ] fields were taken off-line as a result of the attacks . 
[PER Pickard  ] has repeatedly told us she does not like to talk to [ORG USG  ] officials because the [ORG USG  ] is “leaky.” She may be concerned that by telling us the true impact of the attack , more bad news about Shell’s [MISC Nigerian  ] operations will leak out . 
But in any case , her comments about the causes and methods of growing violence in certain areas of the [LOC Delta  ] , particularly [LOC Rivers State  ] , bear concern .
