End summary. ------------------------------------- [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC ASSISTANCE:  ] A PLEASANT SURPRISE ------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The vice president opened the meeting warmly , saying that while he had been familiar with the amount of [LOC U.S.  ] assistance , his visit to a recent [ORG USAID  ] fair had provided him with a valuable education about its " characteristics . 
" [PER Garcia Linera  ] was particularly impressed with [ORG USAID  ] 's microenterprise and agricultural assistance , which he said directly help many poor [MISC Bolivians  ] . 
[PER Garcia Linera  ] also noted the [ORG Ambassador  ] 's October 25 book and equipment donations in the [LOC Altiplano  ] . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] said he hopes to continue traveling in order to demonstrate our desire to assist [MISC Bolivians  ] with their development efforts , as well as to improve Bolivians' understanding of the [LOC United States  ] . 
He expressed concern that many Bolivians' image of the [LOC United States  ] is outdated , and that we are in fact a very dynamic country that understands well the struggle to overcome social , political and economic exclusion. --------------------------------------------- ------ [LOC U.S.  ] EXECUTIVE BRANCH SUPPORT FOR [ORG ATPDEA  ] EXTENSION --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) With respect to President [PER Bush  ] 's announcement in support of an [ORG ATPDEA  ] extension for the region , the vice president said the [ORG GOB  ] is " very happy and grateful " for this " friendly sign " from the [LOC United States  ] . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] complimented the vice president 's October 25 comments on [ORG ATPDEA  ] , saying that he was prudent to caution the [MISC Bolivian  ] people that the matter will be decided by the [ORG U.S. Congress  ] . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] told the vice president that President [PER Bush  ] 's support is an example of our desire to improve relations with [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
[PER Garcia Linera  ] stressed that in the absence of free trade negotiations , [ORG ATPDEA  ] is of critical importance to [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
The vice president acknowledged former Ambassador [LOC LA PAZ  ] 00002910 002 OF 005 Greenlee 's advice to the [ORG GOB  ] on [ORG ATPDEA  ] , saying that he hoped that the [ORG Ambassador  ] would continue in the same vein. --------------------------------------------- REINFORCING THE MESSAGE: PLEASE LOWER THE TONE --------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [ORG Ambassador  ] told [PER Garcia Linera  ] that the best way forward for the [ORG GOB  ] would be to not only lower , but to improve , its public discourse toward the [LOC United States  ] . 
He cautioned that President [LOC Morales'  ] anti-American remarks may damage [LOC Bolivia  ] 's chances for an [ORG ATPDEA  ] extension . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] explained that before his arrival at post , he participated in counternarcotics certification conversations , in which he said there were serious questions about recertifying [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
If we hadn't certified , the [ORG Ambassador  ] said , we wouldn't be talking about an [ORG ATPDEA  ] extension now . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] told the vice president that he offered the president , the minister of the presidency and the foreign minister the same counsel-- that the [ORG GOB  ] needs to lower its tone . 
He said the [ORG USG  ] cannot compartmentalize its foreign policy , but looks at the overall relationship . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] said that by accusing the [ORG USG  ] and the Embassy of conspiracy and assassination attempts , the [ORG GOB  ] had fallen well below the accepted norms of diplomatic and political discourse. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Garcia Linera  ] attempted to defend [LOC Morales'  ] anti-American rhetoric , saying that the president 's history with the [LOC United States  ] was one of " distance and conflict . 
" He said the [ORG GOB  ] wants to turn the page but that " the history is still there , " although " each time less . 
" The vice president said the [ORG GOB  ] wants to close the era of mistrust definitively , saying that [LOC Morales'  ] trip to the [LOC United States  ] for the [ORG United Nations General Assembly  ] was a big step forward in this regard . 
He said the trip enabled [PER Morales  ] to see the " human " side of our country , and that it was important for [PER Morales  ] to see the [LOC United States  ] as an open , pluralistic society . 
He said the president was " excited " when he returned , energized by the personal contact with [MISC Americans  ] he had had in the [LOC United States  ] . 
The vice president said he " celebrated " [LOC Morales'  ] trip and described the bilateral relationship following it as " closer , friendlier . 
" [PER Garcia Linera  ] said he hopes that [PER Morales  ] will visit the [LOC United States  ] again soon . 
The visit aside , [PER Garcia Linera  ] said he could not " guarantee " that [PER Morales  ] would not suffer a rhetorical relapse , but promised to try . 
He said that he had asked Ambassador Greenlee for a " good dose of patience " and asked Ambassador [PER Goldberg  ] for the same as a " very personal request . 
" [PER Garcia Linera  ] said the [ORG GOB  ] is " not looking for confrontation or tension . 
" He said that once in a while , " fissures will open , things surface , but we want to expand and improve relations . 
" ------------------------------ CHOOSE YOUR FRIENDS CAREFULLY ------------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Along the same lines , the [ORG Ambassador  ] cautioned [PER Garcia Linera  ] that [LOC Bolivia  ] 's relationship with other countries may have consequences . 
He said [LOC Bolivia  ] 's relations are [LOC Bolivia  ] 's business , but that the [ORG GOB  ] should be aware that they can impact its relations with other countries , including the [LOC United States  ] . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] offered the example of a recent anti-American speech by the [MISC Venezuelan  ] ambassador , with [PER Morales  ] at his side . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] added that no one in the diplomatic corps seems to have met the [MISC Venezuelan  ] ambassador , a signal that raises questions about the [MISC Venezuelan  ] 's activities here . 
[PER Garcia Linera  ] said he understood and said " we don't need " those consequences . 
Likewise , the [ORG Ambassador  ] suggested that the [ORG GOB  ] be careful not to interfere in the democratic processes of neighboring countries , citing a press report that [PER Morales  ] and [LOC Ecuador  ] 's [LOC LA PAZ  ] 00002910 003 OF 005 " legitimate president " [PER Rafael Correa  ] would speak at an October 26 event supporting [LOC Bolivia  ] 's " revolution " ( septel ) . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] said respect for [LOC Ecuador  ] 's democratic process could only help [LOC Bolivia  ] 's international image . 
[PER Garcia Linera  ] appeared to take the [ORG Ambassador  ] 's comment on board , responding that the [ORG GOB  ] was not funding the conference. ------------------- YOU CAN TALK TO ME ------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The vice president said he hoped the [ORG Ambassador  ] would rely on him as an " instant messenger " for any communications with the [ORG GOB  ] in order to avoid missteps in the relationship . 
[PER Garcia Linera  ] said , " Don't doubt me as a channel for anything . 
" He encouraged the [ORG Ambassador  ] to pass him criticisms and observations , and to call him at any hour or to ask for a meeting with him or the president on short notice . 
[PER Garcia Linera  ] referred to a recent [ORG GOB  ] experience with bad intelligence ( presumably on the subject of [LOC U.S.  ] students in [LOC Bolivia  ] whom the [ORG GOB  ] alleged were undercover [LOC U.S.  ] military operatives ) , saying that if a similar situation presents itself , the president would like to call the [ORG Ambassador  ] to confirm the information . 
[PER Garcia Linera  ] lamented that at the time of that incident , the [ORG GOB  ] " didn't have a bridge " to the Embassy , leading the president to keep the information to himself and then to speak about it publicly . 
[PER Garcia Linera  ] admitted that was " their mistake " and that they have to work against susceptibility to certain types of information. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The [ORG Ambassador  ] thanked the vice president for his offer and agreed to contact him with any questions or concerns . 
He also encouraged [PER Garcia  ] [PER Linera  ] to call him , particularly before publicly accusing the [ORG USG  ] of any wrongdoing . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] stressed that the [ORG USG  ] has not reacted publicly to [LOC Morales'  ] accusations because of our desire to improve relations . 
In turn , [PER Garcia Linera  ] said he would welcome the [ORG Ambassador  ] 's counsel on how the [ORG GOB  ] could improve the bilateral relationship . 
The vice president admitted the [ORG GOB  ] had been skeptical about former [ORG Ambassador  ] Greenlee 's advice in this regard--and had even debated about whether Greenlee 's advice was good . 
[PER Garcia Linera  ] said in the end , they had accepted the Embassy 's advice in good faith and had been pleasantly surprised. ------------------------------------------- MILITARY RELATIONS: VP WANTS TO STRENGTHEN ------------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) In response to the [ORG Ambassador  ] 's stated desire to improve mil-mil relations ( despite [ORG Article  ] 98 restrictions ) , [PER Garcia Linera  ] said he hoped to remove the [MISC F-10  ] counterterrorism matter and the [MISC MANPADS  ] issue from the bilateral agenda , although he said the missiles transfer would continue to be an internal issue . 
[PER Garcia Linera  ] said [MISC Bolivian  ] forces are no longer using the [MISC F-10  ] arms and that plans are underway to transfer them to permit [LOC U.S  ] access . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] said he was optimistic about resolving that issue and hoped that we could do the same with the missiles transfer , despite the political complexities of that issue . 
[PER Garcia Linera  ] said that while he understands the [LOC U.S.  ] position , the pending " internal investigation " of President [PER Rodriguez  ] and other [ORG GOB  ] officials would not be resolved quickly. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The [ORG Ambassador  ] also said that we would like to do more in the area of military education and exchanges . 
[PER Garcia Linera  ] welcomed the overture , adding that he would like to take up the full range of military cooperation prohibited by [ORG Article  ] 98 later . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] gently reminded [PER Garcia Linera  ] that the [ORG GOB  ] should ratify the agreement so they could give him access . 
Finally , [PER Garcia  ] [PER Linera  ] expressed great [LOC LA PAZ  ] 00002910 004 OF 005 interest in the milgroup 's [MISC New Horizons  ] exercise planned for 2007 , as well as other civil works . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] explained that we are asking the [ORG GOB  ] to sign a new [ORG Status of Forces Agreement  ] to make such projects possible , and that we have already raised the subject with the ministries of defense , presidency and foreign relations. ------------------------------------------- COUNTERNARCOTICS: AN INITIAL CONVERSATION ------------------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) On counternarcotics , the [ORG Ambassador  ] said of course the [ORG USG  ] would like to see the [ORG GOB  ] 's voluntary eradication program work , but said the [ORG GOB  ] would have to show quick results . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] said that while he realized coca is a sensitive topic domestically , it is in both countries' interest to work together to fight drug trafficking . 
He told [PER Garcia  ] [PER Linera  ] that it would be impossible for the [ORG USG  ] to support the [ORG GOB  ] 's coca ideology ( e.g. industrialization and legalization ) , suggesting instead that the two governments focus on their common interest in stopping the flow of drugs . 
He also told the vice president that President [LOC Morales'  ] ill-informed statements on [LOC U.S.  ] drug use were not helpful . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] told [PER Garcia Linera  ] that the [LOC United States  ] has worked hard to lower drug consumption , but that consumption is up in [LOC Europe  ] and is a growing problem in [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
[PER Garcia Linera  ] described eradication as " complicated , " but noted that the [PER Morales  ] government is eradicating in many new areas . 
[PER Garcia Linera  ] made a subtle pitch for increased [LOC U.S.  ] counternarcotics assistance , saying the [ORG GOB  ] needs additional eradicators . 
If not , he said , we will see an increase in narcotrafficking . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] suggested they discuss counternarcotics strategies in depth soon , and noted that the October 28 arrival of [ORG INL Deputy Assistant  ] Secretary [PER Christy McCampbell  ] would present an immediate opportunity for further dialogue. ----------------------- A [ORG UNITED PUBLIC FRONT  ] ----------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Following the meeting , the [ORG Ambassador  ] and the vice president held a joint press conference at the [ORG Ambassador  ] 's urging , the first of its kind since [PER Morales  ] took office in January . 
Like the meeting , the tone of the press conference was warm . 
The vice president publicly thanked the [ORG Ambassador  ] for his visit , describing it as " cordial . 
" [PER Garcia Linera  ] said he and the [ORG Ambassador  ] had discussed " steps forward " on many issues of mutual interest , and cited the [ORG GOB  ] 's will and his own personal commitment to " expand and improve " relations with the [LOC United States  ] , particularly in order to promote democracy and fight poverty and drug trafficking. -------------------------------- COMMENT: STARTING A NEW CHAPTER -------------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Despite the recent ups and downs in the bilateral relationship , [PER Garcia Linera  ] appeared to be putting on his best face for the [ORG Ambassador  ] . 
During the hour-long meeting , the two talked about the president 's birthday ( October 26 ) , which a crowd of supporters commemorated with fireworks ( causing an occasional noisy interruption to the otherwise smooth conversation ) and a toy donation ceremony for [MISC Bolivian  ] children . 
( Note: [PER Garcia Linera  ] said the president was delighted to give the children toys because he had played with sheep bones as a child in eocnomically-depressed [LOC Oruro  ] . 
End note ) . 
[PER Garcia Linera  ] seemed relaxed and pleased to start anew with the [ORG USG  ] , even responding to the Ambassador 's invitation to use first names by telling the [ORG Ambassador  ] to " call me [PER Alvaro  ] . 
" [PER Garcia Linera  ] said he had been very attentive to Ambassador [PER Goldberg  ] 's words and gestures since he arrived , implying his approval of his new interlocutor . 
[LOC LA PAZ  ] 00002910 005 OF 005 End comment .
