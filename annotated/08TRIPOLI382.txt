REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: High season for illegal migrants departing [LOC Libya  ] for [MISC European  ] shores continues ; more than half of a group of 70 migrants that made landfall in [LOC Malta  ] during a recent 48-hour window claimed to have departed from [LOC Libya  ] . 
The unexpected death of a key [MISC Libyan  ] official has set back [LOC Malta  ] 's campaign to improve [LOC Libya  ] 's performance in its search and rescue area and efforts to finalize training and repatriation agreements . 
End summary . 
HIGH SEASON FOR ILLEGAL MIGRANTS 2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Maltese  ] Ambassador [PER Joseph Cassar  ] pulled P/E Chief aside for a conversation on illegal migration as the latter penned a message in the condolences book for the recently deceased Sir [PER Anthony Mamo  ] , the first President of [LOC Malta  ] . 
Saying it had been " a bad week " , [PER Cassar  ] noted that more than 70 illegal migrants had made landfall and requested asylum in [LOC Malta  ] during a single 48-hour period earlier this week . 
More than half of the 70 individuals claimed to have departed from [LOC Libya  ] 's coast , prompting [LOC Valletta  ] to task its embassy in [LOC Tripoli  ] to reiterate requests that the [ORG GOL  ] increase patrols in its Search and Rescue area ( [ORG SAR  ] ) . 
[PER Cassar  ] noted that more vessels transporting illegal migrants appear to be calling via satellite telephones to claim distress and request assistance immediately after entering [LOC Malta  ] 's [ORG SAR  ] . 
He suggested that they did so to mitigate the chance that they would founder before being rescued . 
KEY OFFICIAL'S DEATH DIMINISHES LIBYA'S RESPONSIVENESS 3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Cassar  ] said the [ORG GOL  ] 's response to the [MISC Maltese  ] demarche had been " disappointing " . 
He noted that the unexpected death six weeks ago of Engineer [PER Fawzi Ghariba  ] , former Director of [ORG International Cooperation for Libya  ] 's [ORG Port Authority-equivalent  ] and a key interlocutor on counter-migration efforts , had negatively impacted the [ORG GOL  ] 's responsiveness on illegal migration issues at a critical time . 
( Note: Launches from [LOC Libya  ] of vessels transporting illegal migrants typically increase in spring/summer months to take advantage of improved weather and sea conditions . 
End note . 
) Describing [PER Ghariba  ] 's operating style as " [MISC American  ] " , he said the late official played a key role in finalizing recent [MISC Malta-Libya  ] and [LOC Italy-Malta  ] bilateral cooperation agreements on migration issues ( reftel ) . 
More importantly , [PER Ghariba  ] was an energetic and efficient operator and one of the only [ORG GOL  ] officials who approached illegal migration with any sense of urgency . 
In several cases , [PER Ghariba  ] had galvanized the [ORG GOL  ] to deal with migration issues and prompted disparate [ORG GOL  ] entities to coordinate their efforts through the force of his personality . 
On instructions from [LOC Valletta  ] , [PER Cassar  ] has asked the [ORG GOL  ] several times when a successor to [PER Ghariba  ] might be identified ; however , the [ORG GOL  ] has demurred , saying it would be unseemly to rush to appoint a replacement . 
BROADER EFFORTS ON TRAINING , READMISSION AGREEMENTS ALSO IMPACTED 4 . 
( C ) [PER Cassar  ] said [LOC Malta  ] has focused on enhancing training for [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG CG  ] officials patrolling [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG SAR  ] area . 
He said efforts to finalize an agreement to provide such training , as well as a readmission agreement under which migrants found to have entered [LOC Malta  ] illegally could be returned to their country of departure ( [LOC Libya  ] ) rather than their countries of origin , had been frozen since [PER Ghariba  ] 's death . 
( Comment: A number of [MISC European  ] countries have been pursuing similar readmission agreements with the [ORG GOL  ] . 
All have encountered significant difficulty in attempting to finalize those , suggesting that factors other than [PER Ghariba  ] 's death may bear on [LOC Malta  ] 's efforts . 
End comment . 
) He encouraged the [LOC U.S.  ] to continue focusing on training and material assistance for [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG CG  ] . 
( Note: Two [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG CG  ] officers are scheduled to participate in upcoming training programs at a facility in [LOC Malta  ] that uses a [ORG U.S. Coast Guard  ] curriculum . 
End note . 
) Suggesting that he did not agree with [LOC Valletta  ] 's position that equipment donations [ i.e. , by wealthier [ORG EU  ] countries like [LOC Italy  ] ] to [LOC Libya  ] to combat illegal migration be predicated on the [ORG GOL  ] " taking greater responsibility " for its [ORG SAR  ] , [PER Cassar  ] described the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG CG  ] 's equipment needs as " considerable " . 
5 . 
( C ) Comment: The dramatic impact of the death of a single official underscores the severely limited capacity of many quarters of the [ORG GOL  ] . 
Some of the lack of coordination likely reflects the persistence of differing views within the [ORG GOL  ] as to how to address the problem . 
Some [ORG GOL  ] officials maintain that illegal migration is a purely external phenomena of which [LOC Libya  ] is a victim ; they argue that [LOC Libya  ] 's responsibility for managing TRIPOLI 00000382 002.4 OF 002 the trend is limited and that [MISC European  ] states in particular should devote greater resources to economic development and other aid in [LOC sub-Saharan Africa  ] to reduce migrant outflows .
