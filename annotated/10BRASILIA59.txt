Shannon  ] , Ambassador , State , Embassy [LOC Brasilia  ] ; REASON: 1.4 ( B ) , ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary . 
In separate meetings with Ambassador [PER Shannon February  ] 9 , MRE Under Secretaries for Political Affairs I [PER Vera Machado  ] and Political Affairs II [PER Roberto Jaguaribe  ] both focused on concerns that [MISC Iranian  ] domestic issues would make a solution to the nuclear issues difficult to achieve . 
[PER Machado  ] , who covers relations with the [LOC United States  ] , among other issues , said the [ORG GOB  ] is looking forward to a visit by Secretary [PER Clinton  ] and focused the discussion on [LOC South America  ] regional issues . 
[PER Jaguaribe  ] , who is responsible for [LOC East  ] , [LOC Central  ] , and [LOC South Asia  ] and [LOC Iran  ] , spoke at length about [LOC Brazil  ] 's views on [LOC Iran  ] , relations with [LOC China  ] , and the upcoming [ORG BRIC  ] ( [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC India  ] , and [LOC China  ] ) summit in [LOC Brasilia  ] . 
End summary . 
[LOC Iran  ] and [ORG Nuclear Issues  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Consistent with his message in previous engagements , [PER Jaguaribe  ] offered broad praise for President [PER Obama  ] 's efforts to " interface with [LOC Iran  ] in a more comprehensive way , " and emphasized that [LOC Iran  ] 's eventual acceptance of the core P5+1 proposal is the only plausible solution to the crisis . 
[PER Jaguaribe  ] expressed doubts that [LOC Iran  ] would accept the solution in its current political climate , and suggested that the strong anti-Iranian positions taken in the [LOC United States  ] and the [ORG European Union  ] have conditioned the [MISC Iranian  ] government and people to think that any offer made by the [LOC United States  ] cannot be acceptable . 
[PER Jaguaribe  ] called [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program an expression of national identity , a symbol galvanizing popular support for the regime . 
Likewise he viewed any sanctions as automatically strengthening the position of hard-line elements in the [MISC Iranian  ] government . 
He strongly encouraged more engagement with [LOC Iran  ] before considering sanctions in the [ORG UN  ] . 
[PER Jaguaribe  ] said that third-party engagement - including [LOC Turkey  ] , but " not necessarily [LOC Brazil  ] " - would be a key to success given [MISC Iranian  ] skepticism of the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Europe  ] as primary messengers . 
He expressed interest in continuing discussion with [LOC U.S.  ] officials concerning [LOC Iran  ] . 
For her part , [PER Machado  ] , who also covers non-proliferation and [ORG UNSC  ] issues , reiterated the [ORG GOB  ] view that [LOC Iran  ] has a right to peaceful nuclear power , but expressed concern about how the situation with [LOC Iran  ] was developing . 
She suggested a " new path " was needed , but like [PER Jaguaribe  ] , she worried that multiple centers of power within [LOC Iran  ] would make it difficult to find a way forward . 
[LOC Iran  ] and [ORG Human Rights  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) When pressed about human rights in [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Jaguaribe  ] acknowledged a negative and worsening situation but also asked why we were singling out [LOC Iran  ] when several of its neighbors are less democratic with worse human rights performance . 
The Ambassador laid out the concerns in reftel , including our objections to [LOC Iran  ] 's potential bid for a seat on the [ORG UN Human Rights Council  ] . 
[PER Jaguaribe  ] had no immediate response to the demarche points but emphasized that [LOC Brazil  ] has registered its human rights concerns with [LOC Iran  ] several times , particularly concerning treatment of the [ORG Baha'i  ] . 
He added that [LOC Iran  ] 's increased use of paramilitaries in order to maintain order is a sign of the regime 's weakness . 
[PER Jaguaribe  ] acknowledged the [MISC Brazilian  ] 's Embassy lack of capacity to assess popular support for the government but still spoke of [LOC Iran  ] 's government as essentially stable and capable of reaching and honoring agreements . 
[ORG Regional Stability  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Machado  ] said the [ORG GOB  ] would welcome a visit by Secretary [PER Clinton  ] and discussed a number of [LOC Brazil  ] 's neighbors with the Ambassador . 
She said that [LOC Brazil  ] is watching the situation in [LOC Venezuela  ] carefully , noting that [PER Chavez  ] faces a number of internal problems . 
She thought that there was a chance for improvement following the September 2010 legislative elections because there were a number of " lesser known " political figures who may emerge with more influence . 
[PER Machado  ] believed that the situation in [LOC Bolivia  ] had stabilized but remained concerned about connections between the government and coca growers . 
She acknowledged the threat to the region of drug trafficking but identified the primary source of the problem as consumption in rich countries . 
Building with [MISC BRICs  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Recently returned from a trip to [LOC China  ] in preparation for the April 15-16 [ORG BRIC  ] summit in [LOC Brasilia  ] , [PER Jaguaribe  ] spoke candidly about the difficulties in developing an agenda and an overall mission for [ORG BRIC  ] . 
[LOC China  ] , he felt , presented a particular challenge to [LOC Brazil  ] given different perceptions by the [MISC Chinese  ] about what a group like [ORG BRIC  ] would mean . 
[PER Jaguaribe  ] emphasized that [LOC China  ] is very cautious not to make [ORG BRIC  ] look like a group opposing the interests of established powers and as a result works to make the agenda less than fully precise . 
[LOC China  ] is also especially sensitive to concerns from developing nations that don't want [ORG BRIC  ] to purport to speak as the voice for developing countries . 
The Under Secretary also spoke about the difficulty of organizing a group agenda under these circumstances , commenting , " This is a very heterogeneous group of countries with different goals , but the interest is there . 
" [MISC China:  ] The " [MISC Communist Dynasty  ] " <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Jaguaribe  ] joked that the [MISC Chinese  ] government would one day be referred to as the " [MISC Communist Dynasty  ] , " and expressed minor exasperation about the difficulty of finding the right person in the government to talk with about major issues . 
Ambassador [PER Shannon  ] noted that [LOC China  ] 's capacity to engage successfully in [LOC South America  ] has evolved rapidly . 
What began as a commercial and trade-based relationship is now gaining a political component . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] , he noted , are constantly evaluating their performance and improving their game . 
He told [PER Jaguaribe  ] , " [LOC China  ] will be a tough competitor , for the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] .
