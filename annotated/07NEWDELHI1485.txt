( C ) SUMMARY: As requested , this cable contains specific , concrete ideas for opportunities for [LOC India  ] to use soft power in helping [MISC Afghanistan’s  ] reconstruction , with the broader objective of seeking ways for the [LOC U.S.  ] to synergize its efforts with [MISC Afghanistan’s  ] “natural ally.” Some of the ideas are new , many are not , but the intent is to develop a brief reference for the opportunities which are available . 
[LOC India  ] has significant aid to offer , including affordable [MISC Indian  ] professionals ( versus more expensive [MISC Westerners  ] ) , energy production , and training capabilities in areas such as law enforcement , election commission training , foreign service training , and administrative services , much of which can be relatively cheaply accomplished in [LOC India.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Trilateral cooperation on infrastructure and capacity building projects among the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC Japan  ] and [LOC India  ] could also bring economies of scale and/or effective divisions of labor . 
Transit through [LOC Pakistan  ] would greatly enhance [MISC India’s  ] ability to contribute to [MISC Afghan  ] reconstruction . 
We would also have to overcome [MISC Pakistani  ] objection to [MISC Indian  ] force protection if [LOC India  ] is to expand its role . 
The recommendations contained herein come with the caveat that Post has only an outsider’s view of [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and realizes that [ORG Embassy Kabul  ] and [LOC Washington  ] ( not to mention the government of [LOC Afghanistan  ] ) are best placed to identify [MISC Afghanistan’s  ] needs . 
END SUMMARY . 
Background: A Natural Ally , Already Giving Generously ------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [MISC Indian  ] experts on [LOC Afghanistan  ] , such as [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believe [LOC India  ] is well-regarded and liked in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and calls [LOC India  ] a “natural ally” to the [MISC Afghan  ] people . 
[LOC India  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] are considered to be close , and share good relations . 
There are no diplomatic issues between the two countries , nor is there any significant political or popular opposition in [LOC India  ] to aid to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
As [LOC Afghanistan  ] transitions to a better future , diverse , democratic , multi-ethnic [LOC India  ] can serve as a giant role model . 
[LOC India  ] is already a major donor to [MISC Afghan  ] reconstruction , with around $750 million pledged -- making it , we believe , the fifth largest donor country -- and is already involved in projects in a wide range of sectors , including electricity , road construction , and telecommunications , and has even in the past contributed as it could to agriculture and health . 
[MISC Indian  ] aid to [LOC Afghanistan  ] is tempered by what New [ORG Delhi  ] perceives as [MISC Pakistani  ] intransigence , which questions [MISC India’s  ] motives and does not allow for much cheaper overland transit of goods , personnel or equipment . 
NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00001485 002.2 OF 005 WHAT [LOC INDIA  ] CAN OFFER ------ [ORG Affordable Professionals  ] ------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] when asked to highlight [MISC India’s  ] contribution , immediately answered that the best bang for the buck comes from [MISC India’s  ] professionals , specifically engineers . 
[MISC India’s  ] relatively low-paid engineers are more cost-efficient employees than those from [MISC Western  ] countries , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] maintains . 
Without having specific figures on hand , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] estimated that [LOC Afghanistan  ] could hire many times the number of [LOC India  ] engineers to live and work in the country for the same price as one [MISC European  ] . 
[MISC Indian  ] engineers are currently engaged in power construction , public works projects , telecommunications infrastructure , and road construction . 
[ORG Affordable Training  ] ------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOI  ] is already bringing [MISC Afghans  ] to [LOC India  ] for training in various fields much more cheaply than what most other countries can offer . 
From 2002-2006 , more than 1300 [MISC Afghans  ] were trained in various [MISC Indian  ] institutions and universities , and since March 2006 , [LOC India  ] has offered short-term training courses for 500 [MISC Afghans  ] annually . 
In addition , 500 [MISC Afghan  ] students annually will be offered graduate and post-graduate education in [LOC India  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believes that by bringing [MISC Afghans  ] to [LOC India  ] for training , [LOC Afghanistan  ] is able to train five-to-six times as many people as would otherwise be possible . 
Training programs exist in law enforcement , diplomacy ( at [ORG India’s Foreign Service Institute  ] ) , urban development , [MISC English  ] , agriculture development , IT , civil administration parliamentary procedures and other capacity building areas . 
We believe [LOC India  ] would welcome ideas for other areas that would match [MISC Afghanistan’s  ] needs . 
Given [MISC India’s  ] experience in running elections for a billion people , one new area to consider would be training , either in [LOC India  ] or [LOC Afghanistan  ] , for [MISC Afghanistan’s  ] central/local election commissions and election officials . 
Another new area where [LOC India  ] would seem to match up well would be training for parliamentary procedures and support , political party organization , and local administration . 
If needed again , [LOC India  ] could likely revive past training programs for [MISC Afghans  ] in justice , journalism , civil aviation , or the small programs on marketing and enterprise development for women and in-service teacher training . 
[ORG Administrative Service  ] ------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [LOC India  ] is already in the process of sending some NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00001485 003.2 OF 005 thirty [ORG Indian Administrative Service  ] officers to [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( ref a ) . 
As other ministries and government offices are identified as needing outside expertise , [LOC India  ] could be asked to increase these numbers and administrative programs could be specifically targeted to receive specialized training . 
[ORG Affordable Energy  ] ----- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [MISC India-led  ] Pul-e-Khumri to [LOC Kabul  ] power transmission line is running ahead of schedule and on budget , and should provide significant energy to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[LOC India  ] is contributing to further energy production with the [ORG Salma Dam  ] project in [LOC Herat  ] province , and has some smaller projects ongoing , including in solar energy production . 
[LOC India  ] has expertise in power generation through mountainous and difficult terrain , and could be called on for additional assistance in this area . 
[MISC Indian  ] firms are also global leaders in wind power . 
The best incentive for full-scale [MISC Indian  ] assistance , not to mention private sector investment , would be a political agreement which would allow power lines to transit [LOC Pakistan  ] , connecting [LOC India  ] all the way through to [LOC Central Asia  ] . 
People-to-People ------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [LOC India  ] was proud to provide food aid ( in the form of high protein biscuits ) during the 2002 “Back to [MISC School”  ] campaign , as well as humanitarian assistance in earthquake relief in 2002 . 
Should such a need arise again , [LOC India  ] should be one of the first countries [LOC Afghanistan  ] turns to . 
[ORG People-to-people  ] exchanges are also popular in [LOC India  ] with several [ORG NGOs  ] promoting youth and cultural exchanges with counterparts in [LOC Pakistan  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] If and when appropriate , [LOC India  ] should be encouraged to develop exchange programs with symbolic significance , such as inviting the [MISC Afghan  ] national women’s soccer team , or kids from the [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Youth Sports Exchange  ] ( maximum exposure if they have anyone willing to come to play cricket ) . 
As is being done in another exchange program here , young [MISC Afghans  ] could be invited to visit top [MISC Indian  ] ( or locally-based [MISC American  ] ? ) corporations in the field of their interest to take on short internships . 
Numerous other possibilities exist , but one other area that seems ripe is Bollywood . 
We understand Bollywood movies are wildly popular in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , so willing [MISC Indian  ] celebrities could be asked to travel to [LOC Afghanistan  ] to help bring attention to social issues there . 
Straight Donations ------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) In addition to humanitarian and medical supplies provided in 2002 , [LOC India  ] has provided direct donations of materiel to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and could likely fill specific requests in the future . 
Our research indicates that [LOC India  ] NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00001485 004.2 OF 005 has given buses , minibuses , utility vehicles , aircraft , education kits , books , school desks , laboratory equipment , musical instruments , computers and sports supplies . 
[ORG Multi-lateral Partnerships  ] ------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The 21st [ORG Century Leadership Alliance  ] can provide the basis for greater cooperation between the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC India  ] and [LOC Japan  ] in promoting democracy and good governance in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The recent inception of the joint [LOC U.S.-Japan-India  ] project to develop the [ORG Public Administration  ] program at [ORG Kabul University  ] could serve as a model for similar cooperation in other fields , such as agriculture , veterinary science , [MISC English  ] or other foreign language development , or even faculty development . 
In addition to three-way collaboration , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] pointed out that , even when the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC India  ] and [LOC Japan  ] are not working together , they could coordinate better on divisions of labor which could more effectively target donor money and efforts , and take advantage of each country’s area of expertise . 
Additionally , we could explore ways to use the [ORG U.S.-Japan Strategic Development Alliance  ] to approach [LOC India  ] on other coordinated trilateral projects . 
IMPEDIMENTS TO INDIA’S CONTRIBUTION ------ [LOC Pakistan  ] Withholds Transit Access ------ <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) According to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and other Embassy contacts , transit through [LOC Pakistan  ] is imperative for the economic integration of the region , and would be mutually beneficial for [LOC Pakistan  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC India  ] . 
However , [MISC India’s  ] perception is that [LOC Pakistan  ] is creating obstacles that prevent such a land route from becoming a reality , and [MISC Afghan  ] Embassy officials have indicated that they are pessimistic that the Government of [LOC Pakistan  ] ( [MISC GOP  ] ) will budge on this issue ( ref b ) . 
We should use every opportunity to continue to press the [MISC GOP  ] to allow this essential transit route . 
This issue will be on the agenda at the upcoming [LOC South Asia Association  ] for [ORG Regional Cooperation  ] ( [ORG SAARC  ] ) meeting April 3-4 , and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , who told PolCouns March 12 that obtaining a transit route from [LOC Afghanistan  ] through [LOC Pakistan  ] to [LOC India  ] was the “only benefit of [MISC Afghanistan’s  ] membership in [ORG SAARC  ] , ” and that [ORG SAARC  ] would be a disappointment if it didn’t advance the transit issue . 
( COMMENT: Transit across [LOC Pakistan  ] would also reduce [MISC India’s  ] reliance on [LOC Iran  ] . 
END COMMENT . 
) The [ORG Security Issue  ] ------ <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Security continues to be an issue of public concern in sending [MISC Indians  ] to work in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Since 2003 , two [MISC Indian  ] engineers have been abducted , and three other workers NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00001485 005.2 OF 005 have been executed in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The [MISC Indian  ] media says [MISC Indians  ] who work specifically on road-building projects in [LOC Afghanistan  ] are targeted due to [MISC Pakistani  ] and [MISC Taliban  ] fears that completion of a highway to [LOC Central Asia  ] will increase [MISC India’s  ] influence in the region , thereby threatening [MISC Pakistan’s  ] interests in the region . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] is also said to be opposed to [LOC India  ] assuming a larger security role in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
As [PER Sudha Ramachandran  ] said in a recent article , given [MISC Pakistan’s  ] sensitivities , [LOC India  ] is not able to provide its own security for [MISC Indians  ] working in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[LOC India  ] will need to work out , with those suspicious of its motives , a way to protect its people on the ground , or it will not achieve its full potential in using soft power in [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( U ) As an outsider looking in , Post realizes that Embassy [LOC Kabul  ] and [LOC Washington  ] ( as well as the government of [LOC Afghanistan  ] ) are best placed to identify [MISC Afghanistan’s  ] needs .
