EO 12958 DECL: 9/29/2019 TAGS PREL , PGOV , LY , PINR SUBJECT: A GLIMPSE INTO [MISC LIBYAN  ] LEADER QADHAFI’S ECCENTRICITIES CLASSIFIED BY: [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , Ambassador , [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy [LOC Tripoli  ] , [ORG Department of State  ] . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Summary:  ] Recent first-hand experiences with [MISC Libyan  ] Leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] primarily in preparation for his [ORG UNGA  ] trip , provided rare insights into [MISC Qadhafi’s  ] inner circle and personal proclivities . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] appears to rely heavily on [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and reportedly cannot travel with his senior [MISC Ukrainian  ] nurse , [PER Galyna XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
He also appears to have an intense dislike or fear of staying on upper floors , reportedly prefers not to fly over water , and seems to enjoy horse racing and flamenco dancing . 
His recent travel may also suggest a diminished dependence on his legendary female guard force , as only one woman bodyguard accompanied him to [LOC New York  ] . 
End Summary . 
[MISC QADHAFI’S  ] PERSONALITY REFLECTED IN HIS PHOBIAS <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi has been described as both mercurial and eccentric , and our recent first-hand experiences with him and his office , primarily in preparation for his [ORG UNGA  ] trip , demonstrated the truth of both characterizations . 
From the moment [MISC Qadhafi’s  ] staff began to prepare for his travel to the [LOC United States  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] various proclivities and phobias began to reveal themselves in every logistical detail . 
When applying for [MISC Qadhafi’s  ] visa , protocol staff asked whether it was necessary for the Leader to submit a portrait of himself that fit consular application regulations , noting that his photo was displayed throughout the city and that anyone of hundreds of billboards could be photographed and shrunken to fit the application’s criteria . 
When the rule was enforced , protocol staff reluctantly conceded to take a portrait of the Leader specifically for the visa application. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] informed us that the Leader must stay on the first floor of any facility that was rented for him . 
( [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that [PER Qadhafi  ] could not climb more than 35 steps . 
) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] cited this requirement as the primary reason that the [MISC Libyan  ] residence in [LOC New Jersey  ] was selected as the preferred accommodation site rather than the [MISC Libyan  ] PermRep’s residence in [LOC New York  ] City.XXXXXXXXXXXX also sought to find accommodations with room to pitch [MISC Qadhafi’s  ] Bedouin tent , [MISC Qadhafi’s  ] traditional site for receiving visitors and conducting meetings , as it offers him a non-verbal way of communicating that he is a man close to his cultural roots. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Qadhafi’s  ] dislike of long flights and apparent fear of flying over water also caused logistical headaches [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] explained that the [MISC Libyan  ] delegation would arrive from [LOC Portugal  ] , as [PER Qadhafi  ] “cannot fly more than eight hours” and would need to overnight in [LOC Europe  ] prior to continuing his journey to [LOC New York  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also revealed in the same conversation that [PER Qadhafi  ] does not like to fly over water . 
Presumably for similar reasons , [MISC Qadhafi’s  ] staff also requested a stop in [LOC Newfoundland  ] to break his travel from [LOC Venezuela  ] to [LOC Libya  ] on September 29 . 
[ Note: The Government of [LOC Canada  ] recently confirmed that the [MISC Libyan  ] delegation canceled plans to stop in [LOC Newfoundland  ] . 
End Note . 
] DEPENDENCIES: RELIANCE ON A SELECTIVE GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Qadhafi  ] appears to be almost obsessively dependent on a small core of trusted personnel . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] appears to play an equally important role in [MISC Qadhafi’s  ] personal retinueXXXXXXXXXXXX We constantly hear that [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also plays a key role [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also seems to have been tasked with insuring that the [MISC Leader’s  ] image is well-preserved through the full array of carefully-planned media events. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Finally , [PER Qadhafi  ] relies heavily on his long-time [MISC Ukrainian  ] nurse , [PER Galyna XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , who has been described as a “voluptuous blonde.” Of the rumored staff of four [MISC Ukrainian  ] nurses that cater to the [MISC Leader’s  ] health and well-being , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] emphasized to multiple Emboffs that [PER Qadhafi  ] cannot travel without [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , as she alone “knows his routine.” When XXXXXXXXXXXX’s late visa application resulted in her [ORG Security Advisory Opinion  ] being received on the day [MISC Qadhafi’s  ] party planned to travel to the [LOC U.S.  ] , the [MISC Libyan  ] Government sent a private jet to ferry her from [LOC Libya  ] to [LOC Portugal  ] to meet up with the Leader during his rest-stop . 
Some embassy contacts have claimed that [PER Qadhafi  ] and the 38 year-old [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] have a romantic relationship . 
While he did not comment on such rumors , a [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] recently confirmed that the [MISC Ukrainian  ] nurses “travel everywhere with the [MISC Leader.” PREFERENCES  ] - FROM DANCING TO HORSEMAN <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In addition to the personality quirks revealed through [MISC Qadhafi’s  ] travel to [LOC New York  ] , the [MISC Qadhafi’s  ] preferences for dancing and cultural performances were displayed over the last month . 
The three-day spectacle of his 40th anniversary in power included performances by dance troupes from [LOC Ukraine  ] , [LOC Tunisia  ] , [LOC Algeria  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] , and [LOC Morocco  ] , as well as musical performances by bands from [LOC Mexico  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC New Zealand  ] , and a number of other nations . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] appeared particularly enthralled by [MISC Tuareg  ] horse racing during two of the events , clapping and smiling throughout the races . 
The flamenco dancers that participated in his celebratory events appeared to spark a similar interest , as [PER Qadhafi  ] decided to stop in [LOC Seville  ] ( for a “personal trip” according to the [MISC Spanish  ] Ambassador here ) on his way back to [LOC Libya  ] from [LOC Venezuela  ] specifically to attend a flamenco dance performance . 
[ Note: That stop has reportedly been scrapped for unknown reasons . 
End note . 
] NO [LOC NEW YORK  ] PHOTO OPS - [PER QADHAFI  ] LEAVES FEMALE GUARDS AT HOME <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) While Qadhafi’s reported female guard force has become legendary , it played no role in his travels to [LOC New York  ] . 
Only one female guard was included among the approximately 350-person strong [MISC Libyan  ] delegation to [LOC New York  ] . 
This is the same female bodyguard who sticks close to [PER Qadhafi  ] in his domestic and international public appearances and may , in fact , play some sort of formal security role . 
Observers in [LOC Tripoli  ] speculate that the female guard force is beginning to play a diminished role among the [MISC Leader’s  ] personal security staff. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Comment: [MISC Qadhafi’s  ] state visits and appearances at various conferences and summits , both at home and abroad , have revealed greater details about his personality and character . 
While it is tempting to dismiss his many eccentricities as signs of instability , [PER Qadhafi  ] is a complicated individual who has managed to stay in power for forty years through a skillful balancing of interests and realpolitik methods . 
Continued engagement with [PER Qadhafi  ] and his inner circle is important not only to learn the motives and interests that drive the world’s longest serving dictator , but also to help overcome the misperceptions that inevitably accumulated during [MISC Qadhafi’s  ] decades of isolation . 
As [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us , pointing to a larger-than-life portrait of [PER Qadhafi  ] , “When you have been isolated for so long , it is important to communicate.” End comment .
