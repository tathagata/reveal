( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary . 
[PER Greg Manuel  ] of the [ORG Department of State  ] ( [ORG DoS  ] ) and [PER Sarah Ladislaw  ] of the [ORG Department of Energy  ] ( DoE ) accompanied by [PER Morgan Perkins  ] and [PER Matthew Golden  ] of [ORG Mission Brazil  ] met with [PER Alessandro Teixeira  ] , President of the [MISC Brazilian  ] Agency for [ORG Industrial Development  ] ( [ORG ABDI  ] ) on September 5 . 
The meeting aimed to bridge the gap between the [ORG MFA  ] and Presidency with the understanding that [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] , [PER Lula  ] 's Chief of Staff , will take the lead role in fomenting [LOC Brazil  ] 's biofuel policy . 
[PER Teixeira  ] underscored this sentiment , repeatedly professing that [PER Rousseff  ] was in charge of overall biofuel coordination in [LOC Brazil  ] , followed by her Deputy , [PER Tereza Campello  ] , and then himself . 
He explained that any proposed cooperation should go through him or [PER Campello  ] . 
This meetings was held on the margins of the September 5 Ethanol Forum meetings ( reported septel ) . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) In opening , [PER Teixeira  ] acknowledged that [PER Rousseff  ] had received a paper from Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] outlining the [ORG USG  ] 's biofuel strategy and noted the GoB 's interest in exploring third-markets . 
He continued to explain that a meeting earlier with Secretary [PER Gutierrez  ] had focused on [LOC Caribbean  ] development and that [LOC Brazil  ] 's Finance Minister [PER Furlan  ] would raise the third-market issue with [PER Gutierrez  ] during their planned October meeting in [LOC Washington  ] . 
[PER Ladislaw  ] responded positively expressing the [ORG USG  ] 's appreciation for [PER Furlan  ] 's assistance in securing [MISC Brazilian  ] participation at the DoE-hosted [LOC Trinidad and Tobago  ] energy conference. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) [PER Manuel  ] proceeded to detail the [ORG USG  ] 's three-pillared strategy for biofuels , beginning with the [ORG Ethanol/Biofuel Forum  ] which had just concluded earlier that day . 
[PER Teixeira  ] responded that [LOC Brazil  ] maintains a definitive strategy where ethanol and biodiesel represent two distinct and separate policies , although he failed to elaborate further . 
[PER Manuel  ] responded that the two were not incompatible , explaining that both themes could simultaneously promote effective cooperation . 
He also related the Ethanol Forum 's consensus to expand the threshold of discussions to include biofuels as a whole and posited that the Forum provided an outlet to move forward in a concrete , energized fashion. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) [PER Ladislaw  ] continued , detailing the [ORG USG  ] 's strategy for S&T cooperation , the second pillar . 
She expressed interest in understanding [LOC Brazil  ] 's research strategy and how it allocates it funding , while highlighting the potential utility of the [MISC DoE-MME  ] ( [ORG Ministry of Mines and Energy  ] ) working group as a vehicle to explore potential areas for mutually beneficial cooperation . 
Presenting the example of the [MISC NIST-INMETRO  ] conference on standards , she stressed the value of putting scientists together to share ideas . 
In response , [PER Teixeira  ] highlighted his awareness of the [LOC United States'  ] ethanol production problems due to the relative inefficiency of corn . 
That said , he clarified the GoB 's desire to invest heavily in cellulosic research , even if ethanol produced from sugarcane will dominate the market for the next fifty years . 
He also expressed a wish to know what [ORG USG  ] institutions dominated biofuel research , presenting [ORG Embrapa  ] 's newly formed [ORG Agroenergia  ] and a public private partnership involving [ORG CTC  ] as prime [MISC Brazilian  ] examples . 
[PER Manuel  ] explained that [ORG NREL  ] and [ORG Berkeley National Labs  ] led the [LOC U.S.  ] in biofuel research , but clarified that private industry was responsible for a majority of investment . 
He also echoed the [ORG USG  ] 's readiness to send a team of experts to [LOC Brazil  ] to meet with colleagues , identify unknowns and determine potential spheres of cooperation. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Discussion digressed into a variety of private sector initiatives including the relationship between the [ORG Chicago Mercantile Exchange  ] and the [ORG NYSE  ] , and the role of private investment in the form of hedge funds , venture capitalists and investment banks . 
[PER Teixeira  ] , meanwhile , commented that Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] would like to set up a joint program between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] ( [PER Teixeira  ] clarified neither the provenance of his information nor specific details to what this meant ) . 
Expanding on private sector interest in the field , [PER Manuel  ] noted the 40% growth in private investment into biofuels ( in the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) over the last year totaling more that USD 1 billion. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The conversation then segued into third-market development and the role that biofuels can play in catalyzing economic development in weak states to provide economic and geopolitical stability . 
[PER Manuel  ] noted that the [ORG USG  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] are the [MISC Western  ] Hemispheres gorillas and , therefore , natural allies to build up the hemisphere ; [LOC Brazil  ] through cane , the [LOC U.S.  ] through cellulosic processes . 
[PER Manuel  ] then laid out the [ORG USG  ] 's target countries in the region , explaining the rationale of splitting up the targets [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001935 002.2 OF 002 regionally to circumvent an over-reliance on one country or region and thereby decreasing the chances for failure . 
[PER Teixeira  ] responded by changing the focus to [LOC India  ] and [LOC China  ] , those countries' regional development interests and the [ORG EU  ] 's desire to develop [LOC Africa  ] . 
[PER Manuel  ] argued the need to focus or face failure . 
While developing markets in [LOC China  ] and [LOC India  ] are obviously the best choices for quickly increasing the volume of ethanol in the marketplace , the [ORG USG  ] he stated , believes that working with [LOC Brazil  ] to set up regional models/successful pilots would both facilitate and expedite replication outside of each country 's sphere of influence. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) [PER Teixeira  ] explained that [LOC Brazil  ] could be interested in the 7 countries [PER Manuel  ] suggested but noted that each would require feasibility studies . 
He also asserted that any conversation about the commoditization of Ethanol should take into account [LOC India  ] and [LOC China  ] . 
He explained that [LOC Brazil  ] wants to be an international player and , therefore , would be more likely to choose high-profile countries with a degree of international impact . 
He declared that many of the countries the [LOC U.S.  ] presented are important from a social but not from an economic perspective . 
In response , [PER Manuel  ] noted the importance of thinking globally while clarifying that impacts must be viewed from many levels . 
An area where each country can act quickly and maintains a comparative advantage provides lessons learned . 
It is also , he explained , easier to act in a region where the political leverage exists to motivate a country to adopt an ethanol standard . 
That said , [PER Manuel  ] also conveyed the [ORG USG  ] 's willingness to explore other options. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In closing , [PER Teixeira  ] explained that the GoB is " reorganizing their house " . 
[PER Rousseff  ] and the [MISC Casa Civil  ] are centralizing biofuel politics and trying to determine where each GoB entity fits into the equation . 
[PER Manuel  ] here expressed the [ORG USG  ] 's desire for a quick decision from the GoB . 
[PER Teixeira  ] replied that he would pass along the information at a policy coordination meeting the next week. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: This meeting reaffirmed that [LOC Brazil  ] 's Presidency , much like its MFA , is extremely engaged in the cooperative process . 
It is clear , however , that the GoB is in the middle of an internal shake-up and not in a position to immediately respond to the [ORG USG  ] 's proposal . 
One certainty to come out of the meeting is the need for future contact on the subject to include the [MISC Casa Civil  ] . 
There also appears to be an overarching , international emphasis to [PER Rousseff  ] 's biofuel policy . 
While [PER Teixeira  ] responded positively to the [ORG USG  ] proposal , it is very likely that the [MISC Casa Civil  ] will suggest expanding bilateral efforts to include projects outside of the [MISC Western  ] Hemisphere . 
Whether or not [LOC Brazil  ] has the means to fund such activities remains to be seen .
