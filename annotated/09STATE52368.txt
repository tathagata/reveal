2008 STATE 229199 Classified By: PM/WRA DEPUTY DIRECTOR [PER STEVEN COSTNER  ] For reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: In the latest bilateral consultation on the cluster munitions issue , [ORG Department and DoD  ] representatives met with representatives from the [LOC United Kingdom Foreign  ] and [ORG Commonwealth Office  ] ( [ORG FCO  ] ) on May 6 to discuss progress on their national legislation implementing the Convention on Cluster Munitions ( [ORG CCM  ] ) , timeline for ratification , outstanding issues related to interoperability , [ORG CCM  ] discussion at [ORG NATO  ] , and on-going cluster munitions negotiations in the Convention on Conventional Weapons ( [ORG CCW  ] ) . 
The [MISC UK’s  ] primary focus at this meeting was to inform [LOC Washington  ] of an accelerated date for the request of the removal of [LOC U.S.  ] munitions from [LOC UK  ] territory and to seek reactions to the latest version of the draft letter from Foreign Minister [PER Miliband  ] to Secretary [PER Clinton  ] . 
They also expressed concerns with our position regarding the treatment of the cluster munitions system excluded from the [ORG CCM  ] definition of cluster munitions in the [ORG CCW  ] negotiations . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Nicolas Pickard  ] , head of the [ORG FCO Security Policy Group  ] accompanied by his deputy [PER Andrew Ford  ] and [ORG Clare Bloomfield  ] from the [LOC UK  ] Embassy , visited PM/WRA on May 6 . 
PM/WRA Deputy Director [PER Steven Costner  ] headed the [LOC U.S.  ] representation that included [PER David Hodson  ] ( [ORG OSD  ] ) , [PER Stephen Mathias  ] ( L ) , [PER Mark Melamed  ] ( [ORG EUR/RPM  ] ) , [PER Lindsay Gardner  ] ( [ORG PM/WRA  ] ) , and [PER Katherine Baker  ] ( [ORG PM/WRA  ] ) . 
This meeting was a continuation of close bilateral consultations on cluster munitions . 
The last formal meeting was held in [LOC London  ] in December 2008 ( ref A ) , and the group also met on the margins of a multilateral meeting in February 2009 ( ref B ) . ------------------------------- CONVENTION ON CLUSTER MUNITIONS ------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Pickard  ] informed the group that the Convention on Cluster Munitions has been put on the draft Parliamentary agenda for the next session ( November 2009 to May 2010 ) . 
Although the Parliamentary agenda will not be final until the Queen makes her speech to Parliament in November and this session will be short due to the May 2010 general elections , it is likely that the [ORG CCM  ] will be ratified during the session . 
[PER Pickard  ] confirmed that the recommended legislation is in line with and does not go beyond the [LOC UK  ] legal interpretation of the [ORG CCM  ] -- with one exception: [LOC UK  ] personnel , even if embedded in non-State Parties’ armed forces , will be prohibited from firing cluster munitions . 
( At the February consultations [LOC UK  ] representatives stated that from a legal perspective , [LOC UK  ] pilots embedded in [LOC U.S.  ] units could fire cluster munitions , but forewarned that the policy position may not allow this . 
) The prohibition would not apply to other personnel in the chain of command or headquarters positions. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Pickard  ] also noted a gap between the [LOC UK  ] interpretation of the [ORG CCM  ] and its policy decision regarding removal of cluster munitions stockpiles from [LOC UK  ] territory . 
In relation to this request , [PER Pickard  ] stated that the [ORG Ministers  ] would like to accelerate the time frame for removal so that all [LOC U.S.  ] cluster munitions currently in permanent storage on [LOC UK  ] territory would be moved out by the time the [LOC UK  ] MOD completed destruction of its own stockpiles in 2013 . 
Originally the [ORG FCO  ] had previewed that [LOC U.S.  ] armed forces would have until about 2018 to complete the action , in line with the transition period provided in the [ORG CCM  ] once the treaty enters into force . 
[PER Costner  ] noted that the new timeline may have little practical effect on our primary concerns related to operations at [LOC Diego Garcia  ] because most of the cluster munitions there are permanently stored on ships , but must transit the base . 
( [PER Pickard  ] reconfirmed that off-shore storage on [LOC U.S.  ] ships would still be permitted . 
) That said , [ORG DoD  ] needs to review the request because , among other factors , resources have not been allocated to remove the munitions in this time frame. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In answer to queries about the case-by-case temporary storage exception for specific missions , [PER Pickard  ] and [PER Ford  ] confirmed that the concept was accepted at highest levels of the Government , as that idea has been included in the draft letter from Minister [PER Miliband  ] to Secretary [PER Clinton  ] . 
The operation-by-operation definition of “case-by-case” is being put forward for approval at the Ministerial level , backed up by precedent in other agreements for [LOC U.S.  ] use of [LOC UK  ] bases for specific operations . 
Further discussion clarified that , under the latest [LOC UK  ] proposal , any [LOC U.S.  ] cluster munitions currently stored on [MISC British  ] territory ( either [LOC UK  ] territory proper , [LOC Diego Garcia  ] , or elsewhere ) would be permitted to stay until 2013 , while any new cluster munitions the [ORG USG  ] wanted to bring to those sites after the treaty’s entry into force for the [LOC UK  ] -- either before or after 2013 -- would require the temporary exception . 
Any movement of cluster munitions from ships at [LOC Diego Garcia  ] to planes there , temporary transit , or use from [MISC British  ] territory also would require the temporary exception after entry into force . 
[PER Pickard  ] noted that it would be better for the [ORG USG  ] and HMG not to reach final agreement on this temporary agreement understanding until after the [ORG CCM  ] ratification process is completed in Parliament , so that they can tell [MISC Parliamentarians  ] that they have requested the [ORG USG  ] to remove its cluster munitions by 2013 , without complicating/muddying the debate by having to indicate that this request is open to exceptions. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Costner  ] requested that [PER Pickard  ] provide confirmation that the requests for temporary storage would be considered on an operation-by-operation basis when it is clear this approach been approved . 
[PER Pickard  ] requested clarity from [ORG DoD  ] on the process for moving munitions at [LOC Diego Garcia  ] from the ships where they’re stored to the planes , a reaction to the 2013 deadline and specifics as to why the 2013 deadline could not be met if in fact it cannot , and [LOC U.S.  ] reaction to the revised draft letter from Foreign Minister [PER Miliband  ] to the Secretary . 
This draft incorporates changes that we suggested ( ref A ) as well as the request that [LOC U.S.  ] stockpiles be removed by 2013 . 
[PER Pickard  ] requested comments on the letter as soon as possible so that the Government can report that it has been done well in advance of any Parliamentary debate . 
[PER Costner  ] recommended waiting until this summer to put the letter forward , when appropriate officials within the Department are in place. ----------- [ORG CCM  ] AT [ORG NATO  ] ----------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Hodson  ] outlined our concerns about potential proposals at [ORG NATO  ] related to next steps on [ORG CCM  ] and interoperability . 
He stressed that we did not think that this was an appropriate issue for the [ORG North Atlantic Council  ] ( [ORG NAC  ] ) and that agreement on detailed obligations for [ORG NATO  ] members did not seem possible . 
The most that we could accept - and , likely , the most that could be achieved - would be a simple statement referring to the obligations in the treaty itself , including [ORG Article  ] 21 , but without interpretation . 
The note to [ORG ROE  ] 38 related to the [ORG Ottawa Convention  ] on anti-personnel landmines could be an acceptable model . 
In particular , the ideas [LOC Germany  ] floated with [LOC U.S.  ] representatives on the margins of the last round of [LOC CCW  ] negotiations - including that the [ORG NAC  ] recognize that: [ORG CCM States Party  ] request the [ORG Alliance  ] not use cluster munitions ; the [ORG CCM  ] has a different definition of cluster munitions ; and [ORG CCM  ] states have taken certain obligations related to the Convention - are viewed as unhelpful . 
[PER Pickard  ] agreed that a [ORG NAC  ] ruling on cluster munitions would not be helpful and noted that they were satisfied with the October 2008 military advice . 
They did not think the subject should be discussed at [ORG NATO  ] until closer to the [ORG CCM  ] entry into force and stated that any iscussion should be kept as brief as possible . 
[PER Pickard  ] noted that they could probably accept something along the lines of the note in [ORG ROE  ] 38. --- [LOC CCW  ] --- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG Ford  ] expressed [LOC UK  ] support for concluding a Protocol on cluster munitions in the [LOC CCW  ] , but doubted that it would be possible given extreme positions on both sides of the negotiation . 
[PER Mathias  ] noted that we have some hope that some progress could be made . 
Both sides agreed that the input the [ORG ICRC  ] provided in advance of the last negotiating session was not constructive or objective . 
The conversation then focused on treatment of the weapon systems excluded from the [ORG CCM  ] definition of cluster munitions in the [LOC CCW  ] draft text . 
The [LOC UK  ] noted that it placed additional restrictions on the [MISC CCM-excluded  ] weapon making it “CCM plus” , rather than “CCM minus” which is how they have come to view the [LOC CCW  ] process . 
[PER Mathias  ] verified that the [LOC UK  ] interpretation is correct and that the intent of the provision is to ensure that [MISC CCM-excluded  ] weapons are restricted in the same way that [LOC CCW  ] protocol-permitted cluster munitions would be . 
[PER Mathias  ] stressed that there is no conceptual difference in the two types of weapons systems and therefore they should have the same restrictions . 
He confirmed that we are willing to take on the obligations of the Protocol for our future cluster munitions systems , even those which may meet the [ORG CCM  ] exclusions . 
[ORG Ford  ] indicated that accepting additional restrictions on the [MISC CCM-excluded  ] weapon would be difficult for the [LOC UK  ] because their ministers pledged to ban all cluster munitions upon the [MISC UK’s  ] signing of the [ORG CCM  ] . 
It would be difficult to explain why additional restrictions were needed on a “safe” weapon . 
That said , he noted that this was not a red line and is open to on-going consultations . 
[PER Pickard  ] and [ORG Ford  ] additionally voiced concerns that prolonged negotiations could cause states to lose interest in the [LOC CCW  ] process , particularly after entry into force of the [ORG CCM  ] , to which [PER Costner  ] and [PER Mathias  ] responded that they felt many states did not want to be blamed for negotiations falling apart and are therefore willing to allow discussions to continue without progress. ----------- WAY FORWARD ----------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Regarding our bilateral conversation , the Department will work with [ORG DoD  ] to answer the questions posed about the accelerated timeline and operations at [LOC Diego Garcia  ] as well as comments on the latest draft letter . 
Regarding possible discussions at [ORG NATO  ] , the Department recommends that [ORG USNATO  ] remain in close contact with [LOC UK  ] counterparts on this issue , as they will need to work together to minimize unhelpful initiatives . 
On [LOC CCW  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation will continue close consultations with the [LOC UK  ] on the [MISC CCM-excluded  ] weapons issue .
