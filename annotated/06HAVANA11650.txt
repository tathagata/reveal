( SBU ) This edition of “Cartas” features the following items: -- [ORG Paras  ] 2-4 [ORG Medical Malpractice  ] -- 5-8 Baseball , Music and [ORG Racism  ] -- 9-11 [ORG China Syndrome  ] -- 12-19 [ORG Diplomatic Corps Reflections  ] -- 20-22 Bracing for the [ORG NAM  ] ------------------- [ORG MEDICAL MALPRACTICE  ] ------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) NEWS: USINT is always looking for human interest stories and other news that shatters the myth of [MISC Cuban  ] medical prowess , which has become a key feature of the regime’s foreign policy and its self-congratulatory propaganda . 
Two articles appeared this week in our roundup of news about [LOC Cuba  ] that we collect and disseminate daily: --Dateline 31 May: [MISC Jamaican  ] Dr. [PER Albert Lue  ] has publicly denounced [MISC Cuban  ] medical incompetency in handling [MISC Jamaican  ] patients who traveled to [LOC Cuba  ] for eye surgery . 
Of 60 such patients he surveyed , 3 were left permanently blind and another 14 returned to [LOC Jamaica  ] with permanent cornea damage. --Dateline 1 June: 14,000 [MISC Bolivian  ] doctors are on strike to protest the 600 [MISC Cuban  ] doctors who have been shipped into the country , with no concern as to displacement or unemployment among the [MISC Bolivian  ] doctors , or qualifications of the [ORG Cubans.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) In a recent appearance on [ORG Miami Cable  ] TV station 41’s “A [PER Mano Limpia”  ] interview show , [MISC Cuban  ] doctor and former Director of Family Medicine in the [ORG Ministry of Health , Alcides Lorenzo  ] , slammed the [MISC Cuban  ] medical system for being overly politicized . 
[PER Lorenzo  ] had just defected to the [LOC USA  ] via [LOC Mexico  ] , where he missed his connecting flight from [LOC Cancun  ] to [LOC Havana  ] , on the way back from an international conference in [LOC Peru  ] . 
According to [PER Lorenzo  ] , [MISC Cuban  ] doctors spend two-thirds of their time going to political meetings , as opposed to treating patients . 
[PER Lorenzo  ] also said that [MISC Cuban  ] medical care was grossly understaffed and underfunded at home as a result of the “medical missions” overseas , particularly to [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
Unfortunately for [PER Lorenzo  ] , or any other [MISC Cuban  ] doctor who considers defecting from a “mission” overseas , his family is held hostage in [LOC Cuba  ] and will not be permitted to leave the island . 
[LOC XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] --------------------------- Baseball , Music and [MISC Racism:  ] --------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG COM  ] and several USINT colleagues went to the [MISC Industriales-Santiago  ] ( [MISC World Series  ] equivalent ) baseball game at [LOC Latinoamericano  ] stadium in [LOC Havana  ] . 
It was a great , hard-fought game . 
( In the end , [ORG Industriales  ] won , coming back from a 4-2 deficit to go ahead 8-4 , and eventually finishing 10-7 . 
) What was striking at the game , however , was not on the field but rather in the stands . 
First thing: The [ORG Industriales  ] crowd was visibly “criollo , ” i.e , of [MISC Spanish  ] descent , with very few black faces on their side of the field . 
The [ORG Santiago  ] supporters , on the other hand , were heavily black . 
Their music , played in the stands , was entirely of an [MISC Afro-Cuban  ] beat . 
There were also ample dashes of santero flavor among the [ORG SdC  ] followers . 
What really highlighted the racial split , however , was the chants among the [ORG Industriales  ] fans . 
If a [ORG Santiago  ] pitcher was working on [LOC HAVANA  ] 00011650 002.2 OF 004 an intentional walk , the fans would yell , “Pitch , mommy , pitch ! ” That then evolved into “Pitch , guajira , pitch ! ” Then came allusions to the pitcher lacking all of his manhood , again with clear racial overtones. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [MISC Cubans  ] told [ORG COM  ] that the catcalls , chants and aggressive behavior are not new . 
They did say that there has been a marked increase in such racially-overtoned slurs in recent years . 
One devoted baseball fan remarked that the regime encourages such aggressive behavior in order to take folks’ minds off where the real problem lies. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The following morning , [ORG COM  ] and [PER Mrs. Parmly  ] strolled over to the [LOC Callejon de Hamel  ] , a tourist trap in downtown [LOC Havana  ] set up a few years ago by popular artists . 
All the artists there were black , and were very much into accentuating their race in their art , in their dress and hairstyles , and in their behavior . 
The alleyway hosted an impromptu concert of [MISC Afro-Cuban  ] and even pure [MISC Afro  ] rhythms , with both musicians and many black [MISC Cubans  ] in the crowd singing along . 
The show was put on partly to address foreign tourists: The alleyway is listed in tourist guides , and there was a Havanatur bus right outside the street , which disgorged mainly [MISC Canadian  ] tourists . 
Still , the artists and musicians were “into their own thing” for the most part . 
There was surprisingly little panhandling or otherwise pitching to the foreigners in the public. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Comment: These two snapshots were a window into a part of [MISC Cuban  ] life with a dynamic all its own . 
They underline the existence of at least two [MISC Cubas  ] , and explain why so many regime supporters and sympathizers are obsessed with the notion of unity , precisely because they know how hard that unity will be to maintain when change becomes more openly energized. --------------- [LOC China  ] Syndrome: --------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) A couple of weeks ago , there was a concert at [PER Amadeo Roldan  ] theater that featured a [MISC Chinese  ] conductor as guest of the [ORG National Symphony  ] . 
It was part of the normal Sunday afternoon series . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] Embassy made a big deal out of the [MISC Chinese  ] guest conductor , turning out a pretty much full house of [MISC Cubans  ] and others ( presumably a large [MISC Chinese  ] contingent ) , and most importantly , the visiting [MISC Chinese  ] Vice Minister of [PER Culture  ] , who was in town on an official visit. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) After the concert , several officials got up to speak . 
Leading the [MISC Cuban  ] cohort was [PER Abel Prieto  ] , Minister of [PER Culture  ] , who had the usual things to say about the depth and strength of [MISC Cuban-Chinese  ] ties . 
All the speakers got the usual polite applause . 
Then the [MISC Chinese  ] Vice Minister got up . 
Rather than just respond with counter-inanities , he launched into a speech on the success of the [MISC Chinese  ] economic model , including noting the degree to which openness to the world , encouraging private initiative and letting individual creativity have free rein were key to economic progress . 
The audience went cold . 
Not a clap , not a peep when the Minister finished speaking. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [MISC Chinese  ] Appliances: [MISC Cubans  ] who visit USINT tell us frequently that new , supposedly energy-saving appliances made in [LOC China  ] are of very poor quality . 
The small refrigerators have earned the nickname of “underarms , ” because they break quickly and are seen on the streets carried under the arms of their unhappy owners to the repair facilities ( which of course are understocked with spare parts ) . 
The new Chinese-made ovens have a blue plastic thermostat button which users say melts when the ovens are heated up to normal baking temperatures. ----------------------------- [ORG Diplomatic Corps Reflections:  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [MISC Spanish  ] Ambassador [PER Alonso  ] ( May 26 ) described the fight within the “nomenklatura” for the soul of the future [MISC Cuban  ] regime . 
[PER Fidel  ] , with his railings against “Forbes” magazine and his narcissistic rollout of [PER Ignacio Ramonet  ] , s [ORG HAVANA  ] 00011650 003.2 OF 004 book , is “present for now , ” but not for the future . 
According to [PER Alonso  ] , there is a deep split within the government circles that can be summarized as Consumption vs. Investment . 
[PER Alonso  ] portrayed the split with anecdotes . 
Everyone knows the infrastructure is collapsing . 
Look at the transport network , [PER Alonso  ] said . 
[LOC Cuba  ] got from [LOC China  ] 12 shiny new locomotives , which were presented/rolled out with great fanfare by [PER Fidel  ] and others . 
That was several months ago . 
They have still not entered into service . 
Reason: The locomotives are designed to work at peak efficiency at speeds far in excess of what the rickety [MISC Cuban  ] rail network will allow , unless the regime is willing to risk derailment , which it is not. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) So , [PER Alonso  ] continued , the regime comes back to its choice: Does it put what money it has in repairing the rail ( and bus ) network , or in continuing to subsidize tariffs for the average consumer ? 
For some time , the urban transport system has needed to decide on a fare hike , but there are those within the ruling circles who say such an increase would trigger a strong negative popular response . 
The new [MISC Chinese  ] Yutong buses have been put into use on inter-urban lines , accompanied by steep fare hikes . 
( Comment: These have already been announced in “Granma” and “Juventud Rebelde ; ” the papers talked of hikes of 100 to 250 percent in most inter-urban fares . 
End Comment . 
) However , it is quite another thing , [PER Alonso  ] noted , to raise intra-urban fares. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) The regime sounds confident in its public statements . 
[PER Fidel  ] especially sounds boisterous and bombastic . 
Just below him , [PER Alonso  ] concluded , the officials responsible for keeping the machinery running are much more uncomfortable , because they realize how narrow their margin of maneuver is . 
Analyzing [PER Fidel  ] , s reaction to [PER Forbes  ] , [PER Alonso  ] came up with two explanations: [MISC Latin America  ] and his anti-corruption campaign . 
[PER Alonso  ] argued that [PER Fidel  ] , s primary target was fellow [MISC Latin  ] leaders . 
Whether of left or right , most [MISC Latin  ] political leaders are leery of [PER Fidel  ] , who returns the suspicion . 
By trying to highlight how little money he personally possesses , [PER Fidel  ] was telling his fellow [MISC Latin  ] politicians to beware of forces below them . 
( Comment: [PER Alonso  ] implied , but did not state , that [PER Fidel  ] was threatening his fellow [MISC Latins  ] with popular rebellion if they did not hew to the [ORG ALBA  ] line . 
End Comment . 
) <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Corruption in [LOC Cuba  ] is a fairly unique phenomenon , [PER Alonso  ] said . 
[PER Fidel  ] does not fear much the street accusing him of having stashes of cash for personal use . 
( Comment: Other diplomatic sources disagree , and report that the initial reaction of “the street” was precisely to ask where [PER Castro  ] keeps his funds . 
[MISC Mexican  ] Ambassador [PER Pina  ] described what he heard in the following way: The average [MISC Cuban  ] sees the Special Period having ended at least five years ago and the [MISC Venezuelan  ] largesse having started flowing several years ago . 
Still , however , [MISC Cubans  ] note no rise whatsoever in their living standards. “Where is he putting the money ? ” those [MISC Cubans  ] ask . 
End Comment . 
) <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [PER Alonso  ] said [MISC Cuban  ] corruption is remarkable for its universality . 
Corruption is needed by all to survive . 
[PER Alonso  ] said that in most [MISC Latin  ] countries , a corruption scandal consists of a person robbing 11 million dollars . 
In [LOC Cuba  ] , it is 11 million [MISC Cubans  ] each stealing one dollar . 
There are exceptional cases , such as Political Bureau member [PER Robinson  ] , who was summarily dismissed and imprisoned recently for alleged corrupt behavior . 
[PER Fidel  ] sent an equally powerful signal in dismissing his Minister of Auditing and Control , [PER Lina Pedraza Rodriguez  ] . 
( The press reported that [PER Pedraza  ] would be moved to other responsibilities ) . 
However , the bulk of the corruption behavior that [PER Fidel  ] talks about is simply cheating on a small scale in order to get by. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [MISC Czech  ] Charge [PER Vit Korselt  ] ( May 30 ) said he had just come back from [LOC Prague  ] , where he had arranged for the replacement of his DCM , who was recently expelled by the regime . 
The new assignee will be coming from [LOC Caracas  ] , where he handles political and press issues . 
[PER Korselt  ] explored the documents released several weeks ago by [PER Oswaldo Paya  ] . 
He said he was surprised by [PER Paya  ] , s emphasis on outlawing the [ORG Communist Party  ] . 
At least 50 percent of [MISC Cuban  ] society is controlled by the [ORG Party , Korselt  ] reasoned ; he wondered how [ORG HAVANA  ] 00011650 004.2 OF 004 the next regime would be able to function with over half the population put outside the law . 
( Comment: That is not what [PER Paya  ] proposed . 
Rather , [PER Paya  ] , s formula is to outlaw the party but not necessarily ban all former party members from public life . 
) [PER Korselt  ] said he had engaged [PER Paya  ] several times on the point , but had been unable to persuade the dissident of the logic of the [MISC Czech  ] way . 
[PER Korselt  ] allowed that the [MISC Czechs  ] had been the exception , and that all the other [LOC East European  ] countries had followed a path proposed by [PER Paya  ] in [LOC Cuba  ] ; i.e. , of banning [ORG Communist Parties  ] , even if substitute parties were subsequently accepted. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [PER Korselt  ] also commented on corruption in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
He is convinced there are numerous multi-millionaires on the island . 
He has seen too many signs -- fast cars and generous meals at restaurants , for example -- to think that everyone is living on 20 dollars a month . 
He thought this would be an explosive factor in post-Castro [LOC Cuba.  ] <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) The [LOC UK  ] DCM said last week that the presence of lunatic fringe [ORG MP  ] [PER George Galloway  ] in [LOC Havana  ] put the [MISC British  ] Embassy in an embarassing situation . 
On the one hand , they wanted to at least go through the motions of offering assistance to an [ORG MP  ] ; on the other hand , they thought it better not to be seen or photographed next to [PER Galloway  ] , who had just released a statement saying that it would be just fine if somebody killed [PER Tony Blair  ] . 
[PER Galloway  ] made two TV apearances with [PER Castro  ] , in the series of “Roundtables” that aimed to discredit “Forbes” magazine’s article that ranked [PER Castro  ] seventh on a list of the world’s richest kings , queens and dictators. -------------------- BRACING FOR THE NAM: -------------------- <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) As we get closer to September , when [LOC Cuba  ] hosts the [ORG Non-Aligned Movement Summit  ] , we will be ever more interested in factoids that demonstrate [MISC Cuban  ] perfidy in [ORG NAM  ] member countries , of which recent [MISC Cuban  ] history is replete . 
For example , at a recent [MISC African  ] embassy’s national day reception , P/E Officer recommended to the [MISC Angolan  ] Charge d’Affaires that he read ( [ORG Air Force Defector  ] , General ) [PER Rafael Del Pino  ] , s memoirs , which included a lot about [LOC Cuba  ] , s military involvement in [LOC Angola  ] . 
[PER Del Pino  ] , s main point was that the fighting was largely [MISC Cuban  ] military massacring [MISC Africans  ] , and that it was cruel and unjustified . 
The [MISC Angolan  ] replied with the party line about [LOC Cuba  ] helping defend [LOC Angola  ] from [MISC South African  ] aggression , that the assistance was to a sister socialist movement , etc. , etc . 
The Charge d’Affaires , in keeping with his [MISC African  ] socialist principles , then said he’d be spending his summer vacation at his investment home in [LOC Lisbon.  ] <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) It will be hard for us to witness the [ORG NAM  ] first hand , but our protecting power , the [MISC Swiss  ] Embassy , is applying to the current [ORG NAM  ] Chairman , [LOC Malaysia  ] , for observer status , which they enjoyed at the [LOC Kuala Lumpur Summit  ] . 
A XXXXXXXXXXXX journalist has also applied for credentials to cover the [ORG NAM  ] and was turned down . 
His offense: Referring to the [ORG GOC  ] as “the regime” instead of “the government” in his last article about [LOC Cuba.  ] <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) We plan to feature more [MISC NAM-related  ] items in our next installment ; stay tuned .
