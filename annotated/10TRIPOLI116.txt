A " FUNCTIONAL APPROACH " TO [MISC U.S.-LIBYAN  ] RELATIONS <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In a February 8 meeting with the Ambassador and Econoff , [ORG NOC  ] Chairman [PER Shokri Ghanem  ] welcomed the [ORG U.S. Trade Mission  ] ( February 20-23 ) , saying that " most , if not all people in [LOC Libya  ] " wanted closer relations with the [LOC United States  ] . 
However , he said " politics is getting complicated all over the world . 
" He advocated for a " functional approach " that would focus on " where we agree , not on where we disagree . 
" [PER Ghanem  ] understood that [LOC America  ] was " nervous " about terrorism , especially as terrorists continue to come up with new ways of attacking the [LOC U.S  ] . 
( citing the [MISC Christmas Day  ] airliner attempted bombing ) , but in his view , national security policies needed to examine the root causes of terrorism rather than simply focusing on someone 's appearance or nationality . 
He lamented that international travel has become so difficult nowadays , and at times even " degrading " due to extensive security precautions . 
PRICE FLUCTUATIONS: THE NEED FOR A LONG-TERM VIEW <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) According to [PER Ghanem  ] , the recent fluctuations in the price of oil have affected the [ORG NOC  ] 's investment plans , as well as government spending plans overall . 
He advocated for a more prudent approach that would include taking a long-term view of oil revenue and government spending . 
[PER Ghanem  ] rebuked [MISC Libyan  ] officials who tended to spend a lot of government funds when oil prices are high , rather than spreading out expenditures more evenly . 
He said [LOC Libya  ] was committed to adhering to [ORG OPEC  ] production quotas and thus even though [LOC Libya  ] 's current capacity is 2 million barrels per day ( b/d ) , it is only producing 1.5 to 1.6 million b/d , as stipulated by [ORG OPEC  ] . 
SEARCHING FOR THE MOST ECONOMICAL EXPATRIATE WORK-FORCE <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The Ambassador raised the issue of expatriates assigned by foreign firms to their [MISC Libyan  ] partner companies ( [MISC NOC-owned  ] ) in order to share their expertise . 
( Note: Several [MISC American  ] companies have expressed concern about this issue . 
Their agreements with the [ORG NOC  ] called for the [ORG NOC  ] to fund the costs of expatriate experts who would be " seconded " to the [ORG NOC  ] partner company but few placements have been approved thus far , presumably due to the costs involved . 
End note ) . 
[PER Ghanem  ] said he did not have a problem with foreign companies wanting to bring in their own people , who know the company philosophy and approach , to act as senior managers or to sit on joint management committees . 
But for more technical positions , as well as administrative jobs , he said [MISC Libyans  ] should be hired whenever possible . 
He said that 76 percent of the positions in the oil and gas industry in [LOC Libya  ] were occupied by " foreigners . 
" Many of these positions included directors of training or transportation , jobs that [MISC Libyans  ] could do , in his view . 
He conceded that expatriates were needed for other jobs that required experience with new technologies , such as [ORG Enhanced Oil Recovery  ] ( using CO2 gas injection ) or in exploration . 
Another concern was the cost of expatriate staff . 
He said if [ORG NOC  ] companies could hire an engineer from [LOC India  ] or [LOC Brazil  ] for 10,000 USD , they would do so . 
If the [MISC American  ] partners insisted on hiring [MISC American  ] engineers ( costing 100,000 USD ) , the [MISC Americans  ] could pay the difference . 
WATER TAX <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Regarding a water fee imposed on production companies , the Ambassador asked if this was a breach of contract since the [MISC IOCs'  ] agreements include free access to water . 
He added that [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000116 002.2 OF 003 companies were also concerned because the water fees could not be counted as operating costs , which could be deducted from tax payments . 
( Note: Reportedly , most [PER IOCs  ] have expressed concern to the [ORG NOC  ] over the new requirement that companies must pay for water used in operations for re-injection into the reservoirs ; there is a sliding scale according to how brackish the water is , meaning that the freshest water will cost more . 
According to some [PER IOCs  ] , the new fee is a breach of contract since free access to water is included in the agreements . 
End note ) . 
[PER Ghanem  ] said the water fee was not a breach of contract as regulations regarding the use of fresh water is included in [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG Petroleum Law  ] . 
He seemed to intimate that the [PER IOCs  ] were using too much fresh water , which was needed for other uses such as consumption and irrigation . 
According to [PER Ghanem  ] , some [PER IOCs  ] , such as [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG Repsol  ] , have paid the water fee ( but according to Embassy sources , no foreign companies have paid . 
One [ORG GM  ] reported that the [MISC NOC-owned  ] partner companies of some [PER IOCs  ] have paid their water bill , and are expecting the foreign partner to reimburse them ) . 
PLANS FOR GAS <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In a recent press article , [PER Ghanem  ] said [LOC Libya  ] would be investing in new gas projects . 
When the Ambassador asked whether a gas pricing policy had been set , he commented that gas pricing was " very complicated " since in the past , gas was flared , and there was no price . 
Now , gas for local consumption is subsidized , something that [PER Ghanem  ] was against . 
He said under the [ORG EPSA  ] IV agreements , the price of gas was the international price minus 15 percent of that price . 
CONVERTING CONCESSIONS TO EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION SHARING AGREEMENTS: A LONG-TERM GOAL <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) As to whether all agreements with [PER IOCs  ] will be converted to [ORG EPSA  ] 's , [PER Ghanem  ] stated , " Rest assured , the [ORG NOC  ] will honor its agreements , " but that in the long-run , they would move everyone to the [ORG EPSA  ] system . 
The [ORG NOC  ] 's only existing contracts outside of [ORG EPSA  ] are with [LOC Germany  ] 's [ORG Wintershall  ] , and the [LOC U.S.  ] firms included in the [ORG Waha Group  ] ( [ORG Hess  ] , [ORG Marathon  ] , [ORG ConocoPhillips  ] ) . 
According to [PER Ghanem  ] , in any case , [ORG Wintershall  ] said it planned to leave [LOC Libya  ] in 2016 when its current concession agreement ends . 
In his view , once all the companies are under [ORG EPSA  ] 's , it will be more efficient for the [ORG NOC  ] to manage accounting and to monitor their contracts . 
They have invested in training their accountants and others in the [ORG EPSA  ] system in order to simplify their operations , similar to an " assembly line " in a factory . 
As for the [ORG Waha Group  ] , he noted the [LOC U.S.  ] firms had been absent from [LOC Libya  ] for about 15 years , but that now that they were back , he would continue to discuss converting to an [MISC EPSA-type  ] agreement , adding there was " more than one way to skin a cat . 
" WILL THE [MISC LIBYAN  ] [ORG NOC  ] BECOME AN INTERNATIONAL COMPANY ? <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) When asked if [LOC Libya  ] still planned to convert the [ORG NOC  ] to an international company ( [ORG IOC  ] ) , he noted that this was still a long-term goal but that it would be difficult to move the [ORG NOC  ] " outside of the bureaucracy " given that [LOC Libya  ] 's economy is dependent on the oil and gas sector . 
He said he would like the [ORG NOC  ] to eventually become a joint stock company that would pay taxes to the government , like the [ORG Waha Group  ] . 
He opined that this would enable the [ORG NOC  ] to raise its salaries to a more competitive level . 
He noted he had already removed the [ORG NOC  ] workforce from the government 's civil service employment system , which allowed the [ORG NOC  ] more control over its salaries and gave it more power to hire and fire staff . 
VERENEX: [ORG MEDCO  ] WILL BE THE OPERATOR <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Regarding the recent sale of Canadian-owned oil exploration company [ORG Verenex  ] , [PER Ghanem  ] said the [ORG Libyan Investment Authority  ] ( [ORG LIA  ] ) had purchased the company and that [ORG Medco  ] , Verenex' [MISC Indonesian  ] partner , would be the operator . 
He intimated that the [ORG NOC  ] would have exercised its rights to purchase [ORG Verenex  ] , ( for the same sales price as offered by the [ORG Chinese National Petroleum Company  ] ) and thus would have honored the agreement with [ORG Verenex  ] . 
However , the [ORG GOL  ] 's dragging out of the approval of the sale had forced the [ORG Verenex  ] share price to decrease by about 30 percent , which in the end , paved the way [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000116 003.2 OF 003 for the [ORG LIA  ] 's discounted purchase. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [ORG Bio Note  ] and Comment: During the meeting , [PER Ghanem  ] counted [MISC Islamic  ] prayer beads , yet appeared relaxed , candidly answering the Ambassador 's questions . 
[PER Ghanem  ] attributed his October 2009 hiatus from the [ORG NOC  ] to his desire to " catch up on movies , read books , and rest . 
" He voiced a commitment to honoring all of the [ORG NOC  ] 's current contracts , but said he would continue to pursue the goal of converting all [ORG IOC  ] contracts to [ORG EPSA  ] 's . 
While it appears that after his brief hiatus , [PER Ghanem  ] is firmly back at the helm of the [ORG NOC  ] , the rumors circulating around [LOC Tripoli  ] are that he is disengaged and not closely involved in the running of the organization , but rather his deputy , [PER Ali Sgheir  ] , is truly in charge , and taking direction from the top leadership of [LOC Libya  ] . 
[PER Ghanem  ] reportedly returned to the [ORG NOC  ] at [LOC Saif  ] al-Islam 's strong urging , and he may be waiting to see how [LOC Saif  ] 's future unfolds before making any more personal career decisions .
