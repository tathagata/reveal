Noting the vast increase of [MISC Muslim  ] immigrants into [LOC Spain  ] in recent years , [PER Mohammed Chaib  ] cautioned against radical and fundamentalist trends in the country . 
In addition to xenophobic political attitudes , [PER Chaib  ] faulted the lack of unity within the [MISC Muslim  ] community as a barrier to developing a more positive role for [MISC Muslims  ] in [LOC Spain  ] . 
He also criticized the divided [MISC Muslim  ] leadership for not collaborating to build an official mosque in [LOC Catalonia  ] , which has more [MISC Muslims  ] than any other region in [LOC Spain  ] . 
On a positive note , he said that the [MISC Arab  ] world has high hopes for President [PER Obama  ] . 
END SUMMARY <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) [ORG POLOFF  ] met on October 29 with [PER Mohammed Chaib  ] , a socialist party deputy elected to the [MISC Catalan  ] Parliament in 2003 and , more notably , the first [MISC Muslim  ] Parliamentarian in [LOC Spain  ] . 
A [MISC Moroccan  ] born immigrant whose family moved to [LOC Barcelona  ] when he was a small child , [PER Chaib  ] shared his views on the state of [LOC Islam  ] in [LOC Spain  ] , and stressed the importance of immigrants integrating into [MISC Spanish  ] society . 
He said that the high rate of [MISC Muslim  ] immigration into [LOC Spain  ] has greatly changed the [MISC Islamic  ] community over the past 15 years , and noted that more [MISC Muslims  ] live in [LOC Catalonia  ] than in any other region of [LOC Spain  ] . 
Approximately 1.3 to 1.5 million [MISC Muslims  ] live in [LOC Spain  ] , roughly half of whom are from [LOC Morocco  ] . 
The number of [MISC Muslims  ] in [LOC Spain  ] has nearly tripled since 2003 , when the population was estimated at only 525,000 . 
Less than 30 percent are [MISC Spanish  ] citizens , including descendents of immigrants and [MISC Spanish  ] converts to [MISC Islam  ] . 
DIVISIONS WITHIN THE [MISC MUSLIM  ] COMMUNITY <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) The [ORG Islamic Commission of Spain  ] ( [ORG CIE  ] ) , created in 1992 , is the official entity representing [MISC Muslims  ] in [LOC Spain  ] . 
The [ORG CIE  ] has outlined cooperative agreements on education , prayer in the workplace , imams and other policies to help manage [MISC Muslim  ] relations with [MISC Spanish  ] society . 
According to [PER Chaib  ] , however , these agreements were never fully developed and have been poorly implemented . 
He said that competing interpretations of [MISC Islam  ] , coupled with cultural differences between [MISC Arab  ] , [MISC Pakistani  ] , sub-Saharan and [MISC Spanish  ] [MISC Muslim  ] converts create further divisions . 
He added that much of the discordance within the [MISC Muslim  ] community stems from the competing interests of the two administrative bodies that comprise [ORG CIE  ] - the [ORG Federation of Islamic Religious Entities of Spain  ] ( [ORG FEERI  ] ) and the [ORG Islamic Community Union of Spain  ] ( [ORG UCIDE  ] ) . 
[PER Chaib  ] explained that [ORG FEERI  ] was originally created to serve [MISC Spanish  ] [MISC Muslim  ] converts , while [ORG UCIDE  ] was oriented toward [MISC Arab  ] immigrants . 
He said that the two federations need to unite under one secretary general with a common mandate to integrate [MISC Muslims  ] into [MISC Spanish  ] society . 
[PER Chaib  ] , who participated in a [ORG State Department International Visitors Leadership Program  ] on immigration in 2002 , noted , " [MISC Islam  ] is the same . 
However , the administration of [MISC Islam  ] is very different . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) [PER Chaib  ] faulted the [MISC Islamic  ] institutions for not adapting to the changes and rapid growth of the [MISC Muslim  ] community . 
He warned of the " dangers of many different religious movements from all over the world " competing for the attention of [MISC Muslims  ] in [LOC Spain  ] , explaining that a unified , moderate religious leadership is necessary to fight radical views . 
[PER Chaib  ] is a staunch proponent of [MISC Muslim  ] integration , and he said that his primary struggle is " against those [MISC Muslims  ] who want to stay un-integrated . 
" He explained that two types of radicalism exist in [LOC Spain-political  ] radicalism , which is an anti-modernization , fundamentalist movement led by the [ORG Moroccan-based Justice and Charity  ] group , and religious radicalism , which is characterized by Salafists who advocate a separatist , strict interpretation of [MISC Islam  ] . 
Promoting his modern , moderate views , he declared , " we are living in the 21st century , not in the era of Muhammad . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Having grown up in [LOC Barcelona  ] , [PER Chaib  ] 's first languages are [MISC Catalan  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] , and he said he did not learn to speak [MISC Arabic  ] until he returned to [LOC Morocco  ] to attend high school . 
He maintains strong ties with [LOC Morocco  ] and recently traveled there with the mayor of [LOC Barcelona  ] on an official visit to discuss the [MISC Moroccan  ] community in [LOC Catalonia  ] . 
Adding that [MISC Moroccans  ] comprise half of the [MISC Muslim  ] population in [LOC Spain  ] , he stressed the importance of [MISC Spanish-Moroccan  ] relations to combat radicalism and cautioned that [LOC Morocco  ] needs to stay vigilant against extremism to prevent " what happened in [LOC Algeria  ] . 
" [LOC BARCELONA  ] 00000154 002 OF 002 NO MOSQUE IN [LOC CATALONIA  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) Although [LOC Catalonia  ] has more [MISC Muslims  ] than any other part of [LOC Spain  ] , no proper mosque exists in the region . 
[MISC Muslims  ] in [LOC Catalonia  ] congregate in approximately 170 neighborhood prayer rooms and oratories , many of which are informal operations run out of garages or commercial spaces . 
In 2006 a proposed mosque in the beachfront [LOC Badalona  ] neighborhood of [LOC Barcelona  ] was defeated by a campaign directed by [MISC Partido Popular  ] activists who gathered 4,000 voters' signatures against the mosque . 
( [MISC Note: Another  ] ongoing proposal to build a mosque in the city of [LOC Lleida  ] has faced similar opposition for the past eight years . 
End Note . 
) [PER Chaib  ] also cited the anti-immigration Platform for [LOC Catalonia  ] party as " racist and anti-Muslim " . 
Much of the blame , he added , stems from the lack of unity within the [MISC Muslim  ] community as the different factions cannot agree on the characteristics of an official mosque . 
While [PER Chaib  ] did say that relations between [MISC Moroccans  ] and [MISC Pakistanis  ] in [LOC Catalonia  ] are good , he believes that the [MISC Pakistani  ] community resists integrating and being more open to [MISC Spanish  ] society . 
[PER Chaib  ] said that his goal is to have a " [MISC Muslim  ] community that lives in peace within [MISC Spanish  ] society , and has a true mosque . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) [PER Chaib  ] said that until several years ago many of the imams in the informal prayer centers did not have residency permits , and obtaining religious-based visas was difficult . 
He credited the [MISC Spanish  ] government in recent years for recognizing the importance of legalizing the immigration status of religious leaders , and said that most of the roughly 170 imams in [LOC Catalonia  ] are now legal residents . 
[PER Chaib  ] said that as the number of [MISC Muslim  ] immigrants increased , traditional fathers increasingly voiced their concerns with their daughters receiving a westernized education . 
As a result , the [MISC Spanish  ] government recognized the importance of promoting moderate religious leaders to explain the role of [MISC Islam  ] in a western society . 
COMMUNITY RELATIONS <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) [PER Chaib  ] also stressed the importance of educating [MISC Muslim  ] youth and [MISC Spanish  ] born children of immigrants to be politically active and participate in society . 
The founder of the Ibn [PER Batuta  ] Socio-Cultural Association , a secular organization that aims to improve relations between [MISC Muslims  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] society , [PER Chaib  ] is active at both the political and grassroots level . 
The Ibn [PER Batuta  ] center - named after the famed 14th century [MISC Moroccan  ] explorer - organizes cultural activities , neighborhood dialogues , workshops on [MISC Islam  ] , and job assistance programs . 
[PER Chaib  ] said that because of the high number of immigrants that typically work in [LOC Catalonia  ] 's now struggling construction industry , the economic crisis has hurt [MISC Muslims  ] particularly hard . 
He added that economic woes and unemployment create more tensions than do religious and cultural differences . 
Noting that [MISC Latin American  ] immigrants in [LOC Spain  ] can vote in municipal elections - unlike most [MISC Muslim  ] immigrants- [PER Chaib  ] mentioned the importance of the [MISC Spanish  ] government signing bilateral accords with [LOC Morocco  ] , [LOC Pakistan  ] and other countries to allow non-citizen immigrants to participate in the political process. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) [PER Chaib  ] , who excused himself three times during the hour and a half long meeting to vote on different resolutions in the [MISC Catalan  ] [ORG Parliament  ] , spoke highly of his 2002 visit to the [LOC U.S.  ] and like many interlocutors these days was hopeful that President [PER Obama  ] would visit [LOC Barcelona  ] next year . 
Before concluding the meeting with a tour of the [ORG Parliament  ] building and introductions to several other socialist deputies , [PER Chaib  ] said that [MISC Arabs  ] have both high hopes and high expectations for President [PER Obama  ] , noting " the doors of hope are opening , and it 's easier to work in that environment .
