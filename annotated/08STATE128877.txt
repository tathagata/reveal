Please see paragraph 4. ------- SUMMARY ------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S//REL SAU ) During the week of 13 October and in response to ISN Acting Assistant Secretary [PER Patricia McNerney  ] 's encouragement to help increase pressure on [LOC Iran  ] to change course , [MISC Saudi  ] MFA Undersecretary for [ORG Multilateral Affairs  ] , Prince [PER Turki Bin Mohamed Bin Saud Al-Kabeer  ] requested [LOC U.S.  ] recommendations on specific actions [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] could take ( REF A ) . 
[LOC Washington  ] would like to provide the following non-paper to the [LOC Kingdom of  ] [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] ( [ORG KSA  ] ) , which contains suggestions on how to further enhance [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , s non-proliferation efforts with regard to [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
On October 16 , 2008 , the [ORG Financial Action Task Force  ] ( [ORG FATF  ] ) issued its fourth warning of the serious threat posed by [LOC Iran  ] 's lack of a sufficient anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing regime ( REF B ) . 
During the same plenary meeting , [ORG FATF  ] also separately issued guidance on the steps that countries should take to implement [ORG UNSCR  ] 1803 's call for vigilance over the activities of financial institutions in their territories with all banks domiciled in [LOC Iran  ] , in order to avoid such activities contributing to proliferation sensitive nuclear activities or to the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems . 
These two actions by the [ORG FATF  ] , combined with the already widely held view that [MISC Iranian  ] financial institutions play a key role in [LOC Iran  ] 's proliferation efforts , merit immediate action by countries to mitigate these illicit finance risks. ---------- OBJECTIVES ---------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S//REL SAU ) [LOC Washington  ] requests Embassy [LOC Riyadh  ] approach Prince [PER Turki  ] , or other appropriate senior [ORG KSA  ] officials , to discuss this issue and provide [LOC U.S.  ] recommendations . 
Post should pursue the following objectives: -- Present the non-paper at paragraph 5 to [ORG KSA  ] officials . 
-- Urge host government to issue a public statement that advances the October 2008 [ORG FATF  ] statement on [LOC Iran  ] , and encourage all regional partners to do the same . 
-- Encourage host government to carefully monitor any financial and commercial activity with [LOC Iran  ] within [ORG KSA  ] to ensure that [LOC Iran  ] does not pursue illicit transactions via the [ORG KSA  ] . 
-- Encourage host government to use its influence in the [ORG GCC  ] to invigorate further actions by regional partners to enhance vigilance over financial and commercial activity with [LOC Iran  ] , as is called for by the [ORG Financial Action Task Force  ] and [ORG UNSCRs  ] 1737 , 1747 , and 1803. -------- NONPAPER -------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S//REL SAU ) BEGIN NON-PAPER FOR [LOC SAUDI ARABIA  ] During Acting Assistant Secretary [PER Patricia McNerney  ] 's visit to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] on 15 October 2008 , she raised the issue of [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program and the need to increase pressure on the [MISC Iranian  ] regime to address international concerns surrounding its nuclear activities . 
Undersecretary for [ORG Multilateral Affairs  ] Prince [PER Turki Bin Mohamed Bin Saud Al-Kabeer  ] requested suggestions on steps the [LOC Kingdom of  ] [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] could take in this regard . 
We believe your government should consider taking action on the following key priorities: -- [ORG National Financial Measures -- Export Control Implementation --  ] [ORG Express Resolve  ] on the [MISC Iranian  ] Threat , and -- Full Implementation of [ORG UNSCRs  ] , particularly 1803 . 
Your vigilance thus far demonstrates your government , s recognition that real action must be taken to protect the region , s security by preventing [MISC Iranian  ] proliferation . 
We believe that if your government implemented the actions suggested in this paper , it would not only allow you to exercise influential leadership with regional neighbors , it would significantly increase the pressure on [LOC Iran  ] to cooperate with the international community and address its concerns . 
We would like to present to you the following recommendations and the [LOC United States  ] is prepared to work with the [ORG KSA  ] to assist with the incorporation of these measures into [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] 's nonproliferation system . 
[ORG National Financial Measures:  ] -- We urge the [MISC Saudi  ] Government to issue a public statement that advances the October 2008 [ORG Financial Action Task Force  ] ( [ORG FATF  ] ) statement on [LOC Iran  ] . 
The [MISC Saudi  ] statement should recommend heightened vigilance and the implementation of preventive measures , per [ORG FATF  ] , s October statements , by all countries with respect to the financial transactions with [LOC Iran  ] given the significant vulnerability that [LOC Iran  ] poses to the international financial system . 
A statement like this from your government would send a clear message to your [ORG GCC  ] partners that the risk arising from [MISC Iranian  ] banking transactions is real and that action must be taken to protect the region , s banking system and prevent [MISC Iranian  ] proliferation . 
-- On October 16 , the [ORG FATF  ] issued its fourth warning of the serious threat posed by [LOC Iran  ] 's lack of a sufficient anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing regime . 
In contrast with prior [ORG FATF  ] actions on [LOC Iran  ] , this statement marked a significant escalation in concern about the terrorism finance threat emanating from [LOC Iran  ] and ratcheted up the call for preventive measures that should be implemented by [ORG FATF  ] members and other jurisdictions to protect their financial sectors from this risk . 
-- During the October plenary meeting , [ORG FATF  ] also separately issued guidance on the steps that countries should take to implement [ORG United Nations Security Council Resolution  ] ( [ORG UNSCR  ] ) 1803 's call for vigilance over the activities of financial institutions in their territories with all banks domiciled in [LOC Iran  ] , in order to avoid such activities contributing to proliferation sensitive nuclear activities or to the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems . 
-- [LOC Iran  ] uses deceptive tactics and front companies to disguise its proliferation activities . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] recommends that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] highlight this fact with its domestic businesses and [ORG GCC  ] partners . 
-- We also recommend that you reduce [ORG Saudi Arabian Industries Corporation  ] ( [ORG SABIC  ] ) activities in [LOC Iran  ] , s petrochemicals market . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] also proposes that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] suspend [MISC Iran-GCC  ] free trade area talks until [LOC Iran  ] accepts the [ORG P5  ] 1 incentives package . 
-- [ORG U.S. Executive Order  ] ( [ORG E.O  ] . 
) 13382 is an authority that allows the [LOC U.S.  ] to block the assets of [LOC WMD  ] proliferators and their supporters and thereby deny them access to the [LOC U.S.  ] financial and commercial systems . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] recommends that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] explore the creation of a similar legal authority . 
[ORG Export Control Implementation:  ] -- [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] should begin work on drafting a comprehensive export control law and adopt a comprehensive control list that meets international standards , including the standards set by the four multilateral export control regimes ( [ORG Australia Group  ] , [ORG Missile Technology Control Regime  ] , [ORG Nuclear Suppliers Group  ] , and [ORG Wassenaar Group  ] ) . 
-- A comprehensive export control system will give [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] the ability to ensure that its trade is secure and will encourage high technology investment . 
-- The [LOC United States  ] is prepared to support [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] in this regard , including through our [ORG Export Control and Related Border Security  ] ( [ORG EXBS  ] ) Program . 
[ORG Express Resolve  ] on the [MISC Iranian  ] Threat: -- [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] should exercise leadership with neighbors in the region and publicly by expressing concerns about [LOC Iran  ] , s continued pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability and destabilizing activities in the region . 
-- We would appreciate public expressions of support for the [ORG P5  ] 1 dual track process including encouragement for [LOC Iran  ] to accept the incentives package . 
-- [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] should exercise its influence with [LOC China  ] , in particular , to persuade [LOC China  ] to reduce its growing energy/economic cooperation and weapons purchases . 
Such efforts by [LOC China  ] run contrary to the spirit of the [ORG UNSCRs  ] and the [ORG P5  ] 1 dual track strategy . 
A high level [MISC Saudi  ] delegation could communicate to [LOC China  ] [MISC Saudi  ] concerns about the threat posed by [LOC Iran  ] , s actions . 
Full Implementation of UNSCRs: -- Full implementation of [ORG UNSCRs  ] 1737 ( 2006 ) , 1747 ( 2007 ) , and 1803 ( 2008 ) , through vigilance and action against [LOC Iran  ] , s efforts to circumvent sanctions are key components to maintaining pressure on [LOC Iran  ] . 
-- A useful step would be for [ORG KSA  ] to vigorously implement [ORG UNSCR  ] provisions such as freezing financial assets and imposing travel restrictions on designated entities and individuals , prohibit dual-use exports , call for inspections of [LOC IRISL  ] and [ORG Iran Air Cargo  ] shipment , and exercise vigilance over any activities of financial institutions in [ORG KSA  ] with [MISC Iranian  ] domiciled banks . 
-- As a reference , the [LOC U.S.  ] 60-day report on implementation of [ORG UNSCR  ] 1803 can be found at: www.un.org/sc/committees/1737/memberstatesrep orts.shtml END NONPAPER FOR [LOC SAUDI ARABIA  ] ------------------ REPORTING DEADLINE ------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 .
