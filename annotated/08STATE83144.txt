Norris  ] for 1.4 b , d <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) This is an action request . 
Please see paragraph 3. ------------------- SUMMARY/BACKGROUND ------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [LOC Washington  ] is currently initiating a more focused strategy to prevent shipments of commodities of concern to [LOC Iran  ] . 
We are approaching countries and asking them to inform their relevant industries of the [ORG United Nations Security Council  ] resolutions ( [MISC UNSCRs  ] ) against [LOC Iran  ] , and encourage those industries to contact appropriate officials in their governments if they receive any inquiries of concern . 
We are providing information about certain [MISC Chinese  ] companies that have provided commodities to [MISC Iranian  ] entities involved in its nuclear program in an effort to encourage [LOC China  ] to ensure such activities are not continued and to encourage [LOC China  ] to adopt a similar proactive strategy of working with their companies to make them aware of potential [MISC Iranian  ] procurement in support of its nuclear program . 
We would also expect that the provision of this information will lead to subsequent expert-level discussions of this issue with [MISC Chinese  ] Government counterparts. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [LOC Iran  ] has failed to suspend its uranium enrichment and heavy water-related activities as required by the [ORG United Nations Security Council  ] . 
[LOC Iran  ] makes frequent use of deceptive tactics in order to obtain items and technology to continue the development of its nuclear program . 
Furthermore , as described in [ORG IAEA  ] Director General [PER El Baradei  ] , s report of 22 February 2008 , [LOC Iran  ] has admitted to evading international sanctions in order to procure sensitive nuclear-related technologies . 
DG [PER El Baradei  ] , s reports of 22 February and 26 May also describe Iran’s installation and testing of two new , advanced centrifuge designs . 
These new centrifuges are called the [MISC IR-2  ] and [MISC IR-3  ] . 
Based on [MISC Iranian  ] declarations to the [ORG IAEA  ] and on photographs taken by the [MISC Iranian  ] Government during a visit to [LOC Natanz  ] by [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , it is probable that these new designs use rotors made from carbon fiber . 
The other version of [MISC Iranian  ] centrifuge ( the [MISC IR-1  ] ) consists of high strength aluminum . 
We are approaching countries that develop the technologies and materials that [LOC Iran  ] , s nuclear program will require ( such as carbon fiber for the [MISC IR-2  ] and [MISC IR-3  ] ) and requesting that these countries take proactive steps to educate and inform their companies about potential [MISC Iranian  ] procurement efforts. ------------------------- OBJECTIVES/ACTION REQUEST ------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S//REL [LOC CHINA  ] ) We would like to reinforce [LOC China  ] , s own efforts in thwarting [MISC Iranian  ] attempts to procure critical materials for its nuclear program from [MISC Chinese  ] entities . 
[LOC Washington  ] requests Post deliver the non-paper in paragraph 4 to appropriate host government officials . 
( Note - The non-paper was originally prepared for U/S [PER John Rood  ] , s recent visit to [LOC China  ] but was not delivered due to time constraints . 
) Post should pursue the following objectives: -- Inform [LOC China  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] is taking proactive steps domestically to thwart [MISC Iranian  ] procurement attempts in support of its nuclear program . 
-- Encourage [LOC China  ] to take similar steps with their companies . 
-- Inform [LOC China  ] that in the spirit of our cooperation , we are sharing our assessment of them regarding previous [MISC Iranian  ] procurement attempts in [LOC China  ] ( information in attached non-paper ) . 
This includes information about specific [MISC Chinese  ] companies that have been approached by [LOC Iran  ] for commodities in support of its nuclear program in the past . 
-- Emphasize that the USG is very concerned that [LOC Iran  ] will continue to approach [MISC Chinese  ] companies to procure materials in support of its nuclear program . 
-- Inform [LOC China  ] that we hope that by sharing this information we can establish an ongoing information exchange to help ensure that both our countries are taking all necessary steps to prevent [MISC Iranian  ] procurement attempts in support of its nuclear program. ----------------------- BACKGROUND AND NONPAPER ----------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
BEGIN NON-PAPER S//REL CHINA: -- [LOC Iran  ] has failed to suspend its uranium enrichment- and heavy water-related activities as required by the [ORG United Nations Security Council  ] . 
It has similarly refused to address [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency  ] , s outstanding questions regarding its past efforts to develop a nuclear warhead , which have been described in detail in the last two [ORG IAEA  ] reports . 
-- [LOC Iran  ] makes frequent use of deception to obtain items and technology for its nuclear program . 
Furthermore , as described in [ORG IAEA  ] Director General [PER El Baradei  ] , s report of 22 February 2008 , [LOC Iran  ] has admitted to evading international sanctions in order to procure sensitive nuclear-related technologies . 
-- DG [PER El Baradei  ] , s reports of 22 February and 26 May describe Iran’s installation and testing of new , advanced centrifuge designs , the [MISC IR-2  ] and [MISC IR-3  ] . 
Based on [MISC Iranian  ] declarations to the [ORG IAEA  ] and on photographs taken by the [MISC Iranian  ] Government during a visit to [LOC Natanz  ] by [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , it is probable that this new design uses rotors made from carbon fiber . 
The other version of [MISC Iranian  ] centrifuge ( the [MISC IR-1  ] ) consists of high strength aluminum . 
-- The [LOC United States  ] is increasing its efforts to ensure that [MISC U.S.-origin  ] goods that could provide direct or indirect support to [LOC Iran  ] , s nuclear efforts are not exported or re-exported to [LOC Iran  ] . 
These efforts include: Outreach to [LOC U.S.  ] companies that manufacture sensitive commodities . 
These include producers of commodities listed in the [ORG Nuclear Suppliers Group  ] ( [ORG NSG  ] ) guidelines . 
We have also taken steps to designate and sanction [MISC Iranian  ] individuals and companies associated with [LOC Iran  ] , s nuclear program . 
These designations forbid [LOC U.S.  ] companies from engaging in business with them . 
-- We are currently undertaking a more focused international strategy to prevent shipments of commodities of concern before they happen . 
These efforts include: Approaching other countries and asking them to take similar domestic steps such as informing their companies of the [ORG United Nations Security Council  ] resolutions ( [MISC UNSCRs  ] ) against [LOC Iran  ] , and encouraging those companies to contact appropriate officials in their governments if they receive inquiries of concern . 
We have also shared watchlists of sensitive commodities with [ORG NSG  ] Participating Governments ( PGs ) and have provided information to [ORG NSG  ] partners on [LOC Iran  ] procurement efforts . 
-- In the spirit of our on-going nonproliferation cooperation and dialogue with [LOC China  ] , we seek [LOC China  ] , s partnership in this proactive strategy . 
We wish to work closely with you to ensure that our companies , either wittingly or unwittingly , are not aiding [LOC Iran  ] , s nuclear program . 
As AFM He [PER Yafei  ] said in his meeting with Acting Under Secretary [PER Rood  ] on June 4 in [LOC Beijing  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC China  ] must cooperate closely on [LOC Iran  ] . 
-- In particular , we want to alert you to specific commodities that [LOC Iran  ] has been trying to procure through [MISC Chinese  ] companies to include high-strength aluminum alloys ( [MISC AA-7075  ] ) and vacuum pumps . 
Certain types of these commodities are controlled on the [ORG NSG  ] dual-use annex and are included in the gas centrifuge procurement watchlist that was circulated to [ORG NSG  ] PGs , and are covered by the [ORG Wassenaar Arrangement  ] . 
-- Additionally , based on the DG , s reports in February and May 2008 , we believe that [LOC Iran  ] may need to procure large amounts of high-strength carbon fiber to support the deployment of additional [MISC IR-2  ] and [MISC IR-3  ] centrifuges . 
Carbon fiber is included on the [ORG NSG  ] , s dual-use annex and gas centrifuge watchlist circulated to [ORG NSG  ] PGs . 
-- We would like to provide you with detailed information we have compiled regarding [MISC Chinese  ] companies that are capable of producing these or other sensitive , dual-use commodities . 
We hope this information will assist you in your outreach to [MISC Chinese  ] companies on your export control regulations as they apply to [LOC Iran  ] . 
We would encourage you , as we have done domestically with our own firms , to ask these companies to contact appropriate authorities should they be approached by entities that may have ties to [LOC Iran.  ] --Regarding aluminum 7075 , we have identified [MISC Chinese  ] companies that have conducted business with [MISC Iranian  ] entities designated under [ORG UNSCR  ] 1747 , such as [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
-- The following are companies in [LOC China  ] that have supplied aluminum 7075 to [MISC Iranian  ] entities of concern: XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX -- Extra vigilance on the part of our governments will help thwart [LOC Iran  ] , s efforts to evade export control regulations and flout [MISC UNSCRs  ] to support a nuclear program of serious concern to the international community . 
-- We believe it would be beneficial if , in the spirit of our collaborative dialogue , you notify us , the [ORG NSG  ] and the [ORG IAEA  ] , if any of your companies receive inquiries from [MISC Iranian  ] entities . 
Sharing this information will allow the international community to better track and stop [LOC Iran  ] , s illicit procurement . 
-- We would like to ensure that this effort is ongoing and we propose a face-to-face meeting with the appropriate experts to further discuss this matter . 
-- We greatly appreciate your cooperation on this and other nonproliferation efforts and look forward to hearing the results of your work .
