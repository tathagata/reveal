1.4 ( B ) and ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: In a positive and free-ranging discussion , President [PER Karzai  ] and visiting [PER CODEL McCain  ] agreed that more should be done to tell [MISC Afghans  ] and [MISC Americans  ] about the progress in [LOC Afghanistan  ] since 2002 and the positive role of the international community . 
On the timing of parliamentary elections [PER Karzai  ] held firmly to 2010 but conceded that a few months could , and probably should , be added to the projected date of May 22 . 
He explained the parameters of [MISC Afghanistan’s  ] projected reintegration program , promising that it would be unveiled before the January 28 [LOC London  ] conference , and consulting with the [ORG CODEL  ] on the right way to gain [LOC U.S.  ] acceptance of the plan . 
The [ORG CODEL  ] and [PER Karzai  ] discussed the situation in [LOC Pakistan  ] and potential for violence that would affect [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) [PER CODEL McCain  ] ( Senator [PER McCain  ] ( [MISC R-AZ  ] ) , Senator [PER Joseph Lieberman  ] ( [MISC D-CT  ] ) , Senator [PER John Thune  ] ( [ORG R-SD  ] ) and Senator [PER John Barrosso  ] ( R-WY ) ) met with President [PER Karzai  ] and his senior security leadership , including the Ministers of [LOC Defense  ] , [LOC Interior  ] and Foreign Affairs , as well as [ORG National Security Advisor Rassoul  ] , on January 6 , accompanied by Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] , Deputy Ambassador Ricciardone , and [ORG COMISAF McChyrstal.  ] -------------------------------------------- The [ORG Bad Old Days  ] .. . 
And The [ORG Better New Ones  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Karzai  ] and the [ORG CODEL  ] , who maintained a positive mood throughout the meeting and a dinner immediately following , discussed the [MISC American  ] political debate over the health care bill and what [PER Karzai  ] termed the “unbelievable” status of uninsured [MISC Americans  ] . 
[PER Karzai  ] told [PER McCain  ] that he’d been “inspired” by McCain’s gracious November 2008 concession speech and that “if it had not been for that speech I would not have accepted a second round” in the recent Presidential elections . 
[PER Karzai  ] added that his acceptance of the second round ( “even though I know I had won” ) would be what he was remembered for in [MISC Afghan  ] history ; [PER McCain  ] said [PER Karzai  ] had been in his thoughts during that difficult period. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER McCain  ] and [PER Lieberman  ] reminded [PER Karzai  ] that they had met in a tent at [LOC Bagram Airbase  ] in January 2002 , with flashlights instead of electricity ; all three mentioned the “treasured” bilateral relationship and tremendous accomplishments in [LOC Afghanistan  ] over the past eight years. “In 2001 [LOC Kabul  ] was in darkness and misery ; now it is amazing and vibrant , ” [PER Karzai  ] said . 
At another point he noted that it was “wrong” to make statements that the [ORG Bush Administration  ] had only made mistakes ; there had been real development during those years . 
As one example , he said , he had been given a list of women to consider for his next Cabinet nomination slate - having such a list shows progress from just five years ago. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG CODEL  ] noted that President [PER Obama’s December  ] 1 speech on the [LOC Afghanistan  ] strategy had brought about a more favorable [LOC U.S.  ] opinion about the war and our goals here , and a recognition that “a threat to you is a threat to us.” [PER Karzai  ] responded that while he was somewhat concerned with any discussion of end dates he had publicly emphasized to the [MISC Afghan  ] people that we “have to do this for ourselves” and continue the “struggle against terrorism.” <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In view of the need to do more to tell both [MISC Afghans  ] and [MISC Americans  ] about what is going right in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Karzai  ] noted his extremely positive impression of his January 2 trip to [LOC Helmand  ] , accompanied by [ORG COMISAF McChrystal  ] . 
He said that it had been his “best trip in seven years” and [PER McCain  ] noted that the trip had been covered by [LOC U.S.  ] media , reinforcing the positive message . 
[PER Karzai  ] complained , mildly , that while he knew that media statements were out of our direct control , [LOC U.S.  ] leaders should also make statements that recognize [MISC Afghan  ] progress. “We will get the army and other institutions built , even if there are setbacks , ” he said , but it is vitally important that we “bring back” a sense of shared purpose . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] had seen incredible developments in education and the treatment of women , Senator [PER Thune  ] said , noting the particular potential of agriculture . 
[PER Karzai  ] agreed but pointed out that climate change was a new and growing concern - at this point in the year there should be abundant snow and there had been none to date. ------------------------------ Elections: Confidence-Building ------------------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Karzai  ] linked the issue of [MISC Afghan  ] perceptions to elections by saying “progress is there but confidence isn’t” among the people because they hear rumors of an election delay that would undermine the constitution . 
He said that [LOC KABUL  ] 00000085 002 OF 003 “talk in diplomatic circles” is of an election delay which makes the [MISC Afghan  ] people “extremely frightened.” A delay would be a “dangerous” opening that the [ORG Taliban  ] would exploit , he said , and “pleaded” with the [ORG CODEL  ] to help him . 
Senator [PER Lieberman  ] emphasized that this was an [MISC Afghan  ] decision , but pointed out the security issues involved . 
[PER Karzai  ] responded that then-President [ORG Bush  ] had asked him two years ago to delay the Presidential elections until 2010 and he had refused since such a delay by the sitting President would amount to a coup . 
This applies again to Parliament ( [ORG NFI  ] ) and “if we’d had a second round I’d be less worried now” ( because he would have a more certain mandate from the people . 
) <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Conceding that a few months’ delay would not engender the same fear and uncertainty , [PER Karzai  ] said that although he could announce a delay , he had to do so in a way that would “convince” the people that elections really will occur. “The MPs want to stay in their jobs , but the country would suffer” if the delay were indefinite , he said . 
[PER Lieberman  ] agreed , noting that President [PER Obama’s  ] message had also emphasized the importance of democracy in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and that comparison of the Taliban’s approach to democracy with [PER Karzai’s  ] was “night to day” . 
Senator [PER Barrosso  ] pointed out that in a second term the “clock starts to tick” and asked [PER Karzai  ] how he would contribute even further to [MISC Afghan  ] democracy . 
[PER Karzai  ] replied that his two contributions would be being the first [MISC Afghan  ] leader to hand over power peacefully to his democratically-elected successor and defeating terrorism. ----------------------- Peace and Reintegration ----------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Karzai  ] noted that the peace process and reintegration efforts help in the fight against the [ORG Taliban  ] by working with those who are willing to come back , especially the “foot soldiers” . 
Reconciliation would extend to more senior level [ORG Taliban  ] ( not [PER Mullah Omar  ] , he clarified ) who are not linked to [PER Al Qaeda  ] , “some of whom are willing” to talk . 
Lots of contacts are taking place , [PER Karzai  ] said , but no common reconciliation policy has emerged . 
[PER McCain  ] noted that for this to be successful the other side should be convinced they can’t win and this should probably be timed to work with the new influx of troops now underway . 
He agreed that those fighting for reasons other than ideology should be helped to return and that the fight should continue against the ideologically-motivated [ORG Taliban  ] , stressing the importance of educating the country that both efforts were ongoing at the same time. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Lieberman  ] pressed him to explain the concept of offering incentives to the [ORG Taliban  ] , and emphasized that this outreach could be problematic if it , s not explained right to the [MISC American  ] people and the importance of [PER Karzai  ] articulating his plan before the [LOC U.S.  ] could support it . 
The “carrot and stick” aspect ( rewarding those who want to end their allegiance , punishing those who abuse human rights and embrace terrorism ) has to be understood , [PER Lieberman  ] said . 
[PER Karzai  ] said he was currently revising the methods and would soon announce a strategy in which sub-commanders might be induced to reintegrate into [MISC Afghan  ] society but reconciliation would need [LOC Pakistan  ] to end its support for high-level [ORG Taliban  ] . 
Later in the conversation , [PER Karzai  ] said he could refer to [MISC American  ] history and the “lenient” terms extended to members of the [ORG Confederate Army  ] , including General [PER Robert E. Lee  ] , when they surrendered after the [MISC Civil War.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Karzai  ] asked the [ORG CODEL  ] how the [ORG U.S. Congress  ] will receive this plan , to which [PER McCain  ] said it would be supported in view of the success of the comparable [ORG Anbar Awakening  ] in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[PER Lieberman  ] , however , noted that outreach to the [ORG Taliban  ] could be misunderstood so it would be vital to have [PER Karzai  ] first explain it , in clear terms , as part of [LOC Afghanistan  ] , s own approach to peace and justice . 
[PER Karzai  ] told a story about a [ORG Taliban  ] atrocity against a woman in [LOC Oruzgan  ] as an example of some excesses which should be punished and would not be tolerated . 
But “innocent country people” fighting for the [ORG Taliban  ] should be treated differently , he said . 
( Note: Embassy information is that the perpetrator of this atrocity was a [MISC Talib  ] but that it was a case of domestic violence , not a political act as [PER Karzai  ] indicated . 
) [PER Karzai  ] said that the “mainstream” is against the [ORG Taliban  ] and on our side . 
[PER McCain  ] noted that while there was concern over governance and corruption in [LOC Afghanistan  ] the people don’t want the [ORG Taliban  ] and do participate in elections . 
He and [PER Karzai  ] pointed out the absence of religious and sectarian violence in [LOC Afghanistan  ] as a very positive sign. -------------------- [LOC Pakistan  ] Predictions -------------------- [LOC KABUL  ] 00000085 003 OF 003 <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The group reviewed current developments in [LOC Pakistan  ] , and [PER Karzai  ] said that the overall bilateral relationship , while an improvement over past years , was “held back” by the [ORG Army  ] and [ORG ISI  ] who continue to help the [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Taliban  ] . 
He said that he wants to engage more and have [LOC U.S.  ] support in doing so , since “the war won’t end easily without [MISC Pakistani  ] cooperation.” He was pessimistic about the internal situation , as was his intelligence chief , [PER Amrullah Saleh  ] . 
[PER Saleh  ] noted that [MISC Pakistan’s  ] energy sector was in decline and that discontent in [LOC Pashtun  ] areas was higher than it had been in the volatile 1960’s and 1970’s ; meanwhile , he said , President [PER Zardari  ] is using [MISC Baluch  ] nationalists as his base of support . 
[PER Saleh  ] predicted that neither the army nor [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] would bring Zardari’s term to an abrupt end . 
13 ( U ) [ORG CODEL  ] [PER McCain  ] was unable to clear this message .
