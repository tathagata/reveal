[LOC LONDON  ] 2666 [LOC B. LONDON  ] 2603 Classified By: Economic Minister Counselor [PER Mark Tokola  ] for reasons 1.4 b and d. <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) PM Brown’s relatively deft performance ( ref b ) in handling the economic crisis over the past month has caught the [ORG Conservative Party  ] off-guard , and the [MISC Tories’  ] response to the crisis has been regrettably tepid , [PER Michael Fallon  ] , [MISC Tory  ] MP and senior [MISC Tory  ] member of the [ORG Treasury Committee  ] , [ORG House of Commons  ] , told emboffs October 29th . 
The [ORG Conservative Party  ] felt the absence of a strong Shadow Chancellor and , the party’s counter-proposals to Labour’s plans have been “all over the place.” [PER Fallon  ] particularly criticized Shadow Chancellor [PER George Osborne’s  ] op-ed piece in the October 28 [ORG Daily Telegraph  ] , as a “weak” , almost laughable , response to the economic crisis . 
While [PER Brown  ] was enjoying higher poll numbers because of his perceived solid handling of the crisis , [PER Fallon  ] argued that once the recession worsens and the public feels its effects , [PER Brown  ] would no longer be immune from criticism , and from being held accountable for the failures of an economic system that he supervised for ten years as Chancellor of the [ORG Exchequer.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Fallon  ] said that [PER Brown  ] should be held responsible for the weakness of the [ORG Tripartite Committee  ] , which he implemented and which failed to identify problems in their incipient stages -- and then which failed to respond effectively . 
The [ORG Committee  ] - which consists of Her Majesty’s [ORG Treasury  ] , the [ORG Bank of England  ] , the [ORG Financial Services Authority  ] - is charged with maintaining financial stability . 
When [ORG Northern Rock Bank  ] failed , Chancellor of the Exchequer [PER Alistair Darling  ] was new to his job , and the [MISC FSA  ] was in the closing stages of being led by outgoing chairman Sir [PER Callum McCarthy  ] ( [PER Lord Adair Turner  ] took over in September ) . 
It would be too harsh to criticize their performance then , [PER Fallon  ] said , given the changes in leadership , but the [ORG Tripartite Committee’s  ] reaction since then and particularly over the summer to the crisis has been inadequate . 
[PER Gordon Brown  ] has had to be the architect of the rescue plan for which , [PER Fallon  ] said , he gleefully has taken responsibility . 
One problem with the [ORG Committee  ] during the time of the [ORG Northern Rock  ] failure was that the three leaders of the [ORG Committee  ] viewed each other with distrust , wanted to keep the others’ institutions at arms’ length , and even , [PER Fallon  ] contended , disliked each other . 
As a result , there had been minimal coordination among the three . 
[PER Fallon  ] himself said he personally dislikes [PER Turner  ] as a rather “soul-less technocrat , ” but that he was highly competent and the right person for the job . 
[PER Fallon  ] argued that the [ORG Tripartite Committee  ] structure should be disbanded , and that the [ORG Bank of England  ] should be given greater authority and the mandate to ensure financial stability , on the order of the mandate of the [ORG Federal Reserve Bank  ] . 
In his view , the [MISC FSA  ] should be responsible for business practices , not financial stability. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The economic crisis was not near its end , [PER Fallon  ] remarked , saying that he expected even greater shocks in the near-future . 
He was most concerned about the lack of disclosure about the toxicity on banks’ balance books . 
Once the extent of the toxicity was revealed , he said he expected many more banks to fail . 
[PER Fallon  ] said the [MISC Tories  ] reluctantly acquiesced to the need for recapitalization of some banks , but that this bail-out had to be limited in nature . 
But what would the government do -- can it do -- when faced with more bank failures ? he wondered . 
The government’s rescue plan has raised the risk of moral hazard and the costs of more bank failures would be too high to fund . 
[PER Fallon  ] also criticized the [ORG Labour Government  ] for not having a plan to extricate itself from banks that the government has recapitalized . 
If there was no timetable for government divestment , there was no incentive for investors to purchase the remaining shares . 
Furthermore , he argued , the banks could be subject to pressures to fund politically expedient , but not commercially profitable projects , the longer they were owned in whole or part by the government . 
[PER Fallon  ] said that further drastic steps may be required as the crisis unfolds . 
For example , he could imagine a nationalized insurance company . 
Comment ------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Fallon’s comments to us reflected [MISC Conservative  ] frustration -- and some grudging admiration -- for Prime Minister Brown’s skill , so far , in seizing the high ground during the economic crisis . 
The image [PER Brown  ] projects of “a [LOC LONDON  ] 00002765 002 OF 002 serious man for serious times , ” and a “leader born for this hour , ” has worked so far . 
The [MISC Conservatives  ] , on the other hand , came across as weak junior partners while taking the tack of supporting the [ORG Labour  ] government in a time of crisis ; and are now coming across as confounded and confused now that they are trying to go on the attack -- so far not being able to articulate an alternative to Brown’s actions . 
Meanwhile , the scandal that has enveloped Shadow Chancellor [PER George Osborne  ] has not helped ( ref a ) .
