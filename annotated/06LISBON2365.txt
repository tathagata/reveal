OCTOBER 12 DVC ( WITH DOS DOD AND EMBASSY LISBON ) Classified By: POL CHIEF TROY FITRELL , REASONS 1.4 ( B , D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary: [LOC Portugal  ] 's Foreign Minister offered to resign if opposition forces can demonstrate any complicity on the part of the government regarding alleged illegal [ORG CIA  ] rendition flights through [MISC Portuguese  ] territory . 
While a government investigation has refuted these allegations , the saga continues due to continued opposition party and [ORG European Parliament  ] pressure . 
This pressure complicates the [LOC US  ] request to repatriate [ORG Guantanamo  ] detainees via [LOC Portugal  ] . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Ongoing pressure from [LOC Portugal  ] 's [ORG Left Bloc  ] and from the [ORG European Parliament  ] led to a testy exchange in [LOC Portugal  ] 's [ORG Parliament  ] on October 18 , in which Foreign Minister [PER Luis Amado  ] offered to resign if the opposition could prove Government of [LOC Portugal  ] ( [ORG GOP  ] ) complicity with the [ORG USG  ] regarding alleged illegal [ORG CIA  ] flights violating [MISC Portuguese  ] sovereignty. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Amado  ] 's most recent testimony reflected that of his predecessor , [PER Diogo Freitas  ] do [PER Amaral  ] in December 2005 ( Ref A ) and his own earlier testimony on September 5 this year , noting the [ORG GOP  ] had completed an investigation that discovered no information to support allegations that [ORG CIA  ] flights violated [LOC Portugal  ] 's territory or airspace to transport terrorism suspects . 
[PER Amado  ] told the [ORG Parliamentary Committee  ] that " None of the explanations or data collected... constitutes a credible indication that the law may have been broken on [MISC Portuguese  ] soil . 
" He went on to tell reporters that a joint investigation by four government departments , also involving the country 's intelligence agencies , immigration service and flight control authorities , conducted a review of plane movements but found no firm evidence . 
" [PER Amado  ] admitted that the alleged [ORG CIA  ] flights might have come through [LOC Portugal  ] , but added that [LOC Portugal  ] " has nothing to be ashamed of . 
" According to the Minister , there is no evidence that the [ORG CIA  ] committed illegal acts in [MISC Portuguese  ] territory and even stated that he has had nothing but " total transparency and cooperation " from [MISC American  ] authorities. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Freitas  ] do [PER Amaral  ] had offered the government investigation as a way to address the allegations . 
The results , however , have not silenced the [ORG GOP  ] 's critics , especially in the [ORG Left Bloc  ] or the [ORG European Parliament  ] . 
[LOC Portugal  ] 's [ORG Parliament  ] has established an ad hoc committee to continue hearings on the subject and a delegation from the [ORG European Parliament  ] is scheduled to visit [LOC Portugal  ] in December to interview [PER Amado  ] , who has declined to visit [LOC Brussels  ] to meet with [MISC Euro Deputies  ] . 
Effect on Repatriation Request ------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Amado  ] 's testimony reflects the continued political and media pressure on the [ORG GOP  ] regarding this subject and makes the [ORG GOP  ] 's efforts to assist in repatriation of [ORG Guantanamo  ] detainees all the more difficult . 
It is critical that [LOC Washington  ] readers recognize the [ORG GOP  ] 's need to ensure that it is on solid legal ground regarding our request on detainees. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Portuguese  ] law , as interpreted by the [ORG GOP  ] ( which could change ) , requires written assurance by the final destination country that detainees will not be tortured or receive the death penalty as well as a [LOC US  ] guarantee that they will be treated according to internationally-recognized conventions in the destination country . 
Without these assurances , the [ORG GOP  ] will have difficulty n supporting repatriation flights through [MISC Portuguese  ] territory or airspace . 
We eagerly await [LOC Washington  ] addressees response to the [MISC Portuguese  ] points as discussed Ref C . 
The [ORG GOP  ] will undoubtedly expect this issue to be discussed at the October 24 meeting between [PER Amado  ] and Secretary Rice in [LOC Washington  ] . 
The Media --------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The local press eagerly reprints hearsay on this tantalizing subject as left wing politicians unveil " new facts " every few days to fan the political fires . 
Post believes the media will continue to sensationalize the issue as long as it has legs . 
Comment ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The normally unflappable [PER Amado  ] lost his cool during the testimony ; an event that is completely out of character and shows the effects of unrelenting media and political attacks . 
Despite this outburst , we believe [PER Amado  ] will continue to reiterate what the investigation has revealed - the government has no evidence of illegal [ORG CIA  ] flights on/through [MISC Portuguese  ] territory . 
However , Post underscores the delicate balancing act [PER Amado  ] is confronting in minimizing damage to his government - however unwarranted - due to the [ORG CIA  ] Rendition investigation while trying to convince it to grant our request to repatriate [ORG Guantanamo  ] detainees through [LOC Lajes  ] . 
Right now , it would be to our advantage to stroke him a lot .
