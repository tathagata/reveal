On [LOC Iran  ] , he emphasized the need for continuing pressure on [LOC Iran  ] , through [MISC P-5  ] unity , which is impacting on [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's weakened position , and which offers the only hope for a negotiated outcome . 
End Summary . 
[ORG NATO  ] 's Purpose --------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG MFA Political  ] Director [PER Gerard Araud  ] hosted [PER Codel Tanner  ] , in [LOC Paris  ] for the annual discussions of the [ORG NATO Parliamentary Assembly  ] ( [ORG NPA  ] ) [ORG Economic Committee  ] with the [ORG OECD  ] , to a meeting and luncheon on February 22 . 
Ambassadors [PER Stapleton  ] and [PER Morella  ] also attended . 
Both sides saluted the historical links and continuing cultural and economic ties between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC France  ] , along with our wide-ranging diplomatic cooperation . 
[PER Araud  ] took the opportunity of the visit of the [LOC U.S.  ] members of the [ORG NATO Parliamentary Assembly  ] to offer , in his typically plain-spoken fashion , a thumb-nail history of [MISC U.S.-French  ] relations since [MISC World War II  ] , including our different approaches to [ORG NATO  ] . 
Recalling an [MISC Cold War  ] bromide , [PER Araud  ] said that [ORG NATO  ] 's original purpose had been " to keep the [MISC Germans  ] down , the [MISC Russians  ] out , and the [MISC Americans  ] in . 
" Its current purpose is -- for the newer central [MISC European  ] and [MISC Baltic  ] members , given their fear of [LOC Russia  ] , " rational or not " -- to keep the [MISC Americans  ] in . 
For other members , [ORG NATO  ] provides a way to meet their defense -- without having to pay for it . 
[PER Araud  ] decried the abysmally low defense spending by the [MISC European  ] allies . 
Among the [MISC Europeans  ] , only the [MISC French  ] and the [MISC British  ] come close to carrying their weight , an exception which can be explained by their history as global powers , and their residual desire to exert influence . 
Trans-Atlantic Ties: The Cases of [LOC Britain  ] , [LOC France  ] and [LOC Germany  ] --------------------------------------------- ----------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Taking up this theme , [PER Araud  ] offered the [PER Codel  ] a historical disquisition on the differences between [LOC France  ] 's and [LOC Britain  ] 's post-war relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] [LOC Britain  ] , for its part , tries to " ride the tiger , " influencing [LOC U.S.  ] policy behind the scenes . 
This is what they have tried to do on [MISC Iraq:  ] " With what success , we might ask ? 
" [LOC France  ] , on the other hand , tries to defend its interests , " tries to exist ( as an independent player ) . 
" The [LOC U.S.  ] often views this simply as opposition , or anti-Americanism , which it isn't: " We're trying to exist , and to exercise our right to have our own opinion , including on how to address international crises . 
That means that we may agree in some cases -- as on [LOC Iran  ] where we work extremely closely , coordinating daily . 
In others , as in [LOC Iraq  ] , we disagreed , and still do . 
This is not anti-Americanism , it 's [LOC France  ] developing its own analyses and exercising its own policy . 
" Stepping back , [PER Araud  ] recalled that the 1956 [ORG Suez Crisis  ] had marked the end of both [LOC France  ] and the [LOC UK  ] 's great power aspirations . 
Each , however , drew a different lesson from their joint failure . 
[LOC U.S.  ] opposition to the [ORG Suez  ] operation , ( which together with the [LOC Soviet Union  ] 's threat to use nuclear weapons had scuttled the [MISC Anglo-French  ] operation ) , had led the [MISC British  ] to conclude that " nothing was possible without the [MISC Americans  ] , " and that their influence would have to be applied through the [LOC U.S.  ] , by being at its side , and having its voice heard as [LOC America  ] 's most trusted ally . 
The [MISC French  ] took a distinctly different course , that of autonomy and independence ( as symbolized in its decision , a few months after [ORG Suez  ] , to create its own nuclear force ) . 
[LOC Germany  ] was a case apart , for historical reasons . 
With a military that was totally integrated into [ORG NATO  ] , it was [LOC America  ] 's model ally . 
Now things are changing: for the first time since [MISC WW II  ] , during the [LOC Iraq  ] crisis , [LOC Germany  ] opposed the [LOC U.S.  ] While the [MISC British  ] and [MISC French  ] conception of their own roles -- " the special relationship " and independence/autonomy , respectively -- still apply , [LOC Germany  ] 's is now a question mark . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] ----------- [LOC PARIS  ] 00000743 002 OF 003 <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In the back and forth that followed [PER Araud  ] 's presentation , Ambassador [PER Stapleton  ] noted that we describe the current state of the relationship as " normal , " a characterization which [PER Araud  ] 's historical synopsis supported . 
It 's a relationship we value , said the Ambassador ; and we certainly do not take the [MISC French  ] for granted . 
Rep [PER John Tanner  ] ( [MISC D-TN  ] ) agreed on the value of a diversity of opinion . 
Reaffirming strong [LOC U.S.  ] support for [ORG NATO  ] , he pointed to [LOC Afghanistan  ] as the [ORG Alliance  ] 's defining issue . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] appreciates [LOC France  ] 's support in this crucial battle . 
Congressman [PER Paul Gillmor  ] ( [MISC R-OH  ] ) , Vice-President of the [ORG NPA  ] , noted the importance of the [ORG NATO  ] to the [LOC U.S  ] , [LOC France  ] 's commitment of resources to defense , and the commonality of interests in our joint effort in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
( NOTE: [PER Congressmen Tanner  ] and [PER Gillmor  ] earlier met with [MISC French  ] television and print media to push for strengthened [MISC Allied  ] support in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
END NOTE . 
) [PER Araud  ] agreed , citing the recent dispatch of the [MISC French  ] aircraft carrier [PER Charles de Gaulle  ] to the region , which will allow [LOC France  ] to increase its participation in airstrikes in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
However , [LOC France  ] 's concern is lack of a " political strategy " concerning [LOC Afghanistan  ] , a point [ORG Chirac  ] tried to make at the [LOC Riga Summit  ] . 
Perhaps [LOC France  ] 's proposed [ORG Contact Group  ] wasn't the right solution , said [PER Araud  ] , as it raises the question of neighboring countries' roles , and [LOC Afghanistan  ] 's as well . 
But at the end of the day , success in [LOC Afghanistan  ] will be political , " and we are simply not convinced we have a political strategy , an end-game in view , a roadmap to success . 
If what we are doing simply amounts to killing [ORG Taliban  ] every Spring , some of us , five years from now , will have tired of this . 
That 's our concern ; we're not criticizing [ORG NATO  ] , which is doing it 's job . 
It 's the political strategy that 's missing . 
For example , [LOC Iran  ] is a natural ally in the fight against the [ORG Taliban  ] . 
And there is the drug problem , which affects you , us and [LOC Russia  ] . 
We're concerned about where we're going . 
" [LOC Iran  ] ---- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Responding to Congressman [PER Dennis Moore  ] 's ( [MISC D-KS  ] ) question about the [MISC French  ] view of [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Araud  ] underlined how closely the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC France  ] have been working together over the past four years . 
He distinguished [LOC Iran  ] from [LOC North Korea  ] , " a criminal regime which doesn't care about the suffering of its people . 
" [LOC Iran  ] , on the other hand , is a " sort of democracy , " a proud country , where public opinion counts for something , and which doesn't want to be seen as a pariah state . 
This complex reality calls for a dual policy: a readiness to negotiate , but in a context of international pressure . 
During the negotiation of [ORG UNSCR  ] 1737 a difference opened up between the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [MISC EU-3  ] , said [PER Araud  ] , with the [LOC U.S.  ] seeking a stronger text , while the [MISC Europeans  ] insisted on one that could be supported by the [MISC P-5  ] . 
[PER Araud  ] contended that now the [LOC U.S.  ] agrees , retrospectively , that the [MISC Europeans  ] were right on insisting on a unanimous outcome , one that could not be interpreted as the [LOC West  ] ganging up on [LOC Iran  ] . 
UNSC unanimity ( and especially [LOC China  ] 's vote ) sent a powerful message of [LOC Iran  ] 's isolation , impacting strongly on [MISC Iranian  ] public opinion . 
[PER Araud  ] admitted that " mercantile " factors were driving some , especially the [MISC Russians  ] . 
While the [MISC French  ] [ORG Treasury  ] " is furious " about [LOC U.S.  ] warnings to [MISC European  ] banks about their operations with [LOC Iran  ] , said [PER Araud  ] , those efforts work -- they're very effective . 
[PER Araud  ] commented that the [LOC U.S.  ] military option is taken very seriously in [LOC Iran  ] . 
As recounted to him by well-known [MISC French  ] journalist [PER Bernard Guetta  ] , who recently returned from [LOC Tehran  ] , " the [MISC Iranians  ] are terrified ; they take the [LOC U.S.  ] military threat seriously -- people don't want it . 
" Another important factor is [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's growing weakness . 
" He was elected because he wasn't corrupt , he promised housing and good administration , but he hasn't delivered . 
And there was his recent defeat in the municipal elections . 
That said , although the music has changed , the words haven't " : The [MISC Iranians  ] continue to refuse to suspend enrichment . 
Therefore we must keep up the pressure . 
And the pressure is working . 
So now we must work on a second sanctions resolution , and keep the door open to a " double suspension " deal with [LOC Iran  ] . 
We haven't failed , emphasized [PER Araud  ] . 
According to [PER Guetta  ] , he said , many people close to Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] had " incredibly violent things to say about [PER Ahmadinejad  ] whom they regard as an upstart . 
They want him out . 
The subdued celebration of [MISC Revolution Day  ] , including [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's speech , in which he did not mention the [MISC Holocaust  ] , was significant . 
[PER Araud  ] also pointed to a recent press interview with [ORG Velayati  ] in which he affirmed that the [MISC Holocaust  ] was a historical reality . 
We have two to three years , concluded [PER Araud  ] , to work on this before [LOC Iran  ] gets the bomb . 
We will and must continue to work on this together -- including with the [MISC Russians  ] and [MISC Chinese  ] .

( U ) [PER Codel Tanner  ] did not have the opportunity to clear this cable before departing [LOC Paris  ] .
