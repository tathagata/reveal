( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary . 
[ORG Boeing Sales  ] Director for [LOC Brazil  ] , [PER Jose Sicilia  ] , told [ORG Emboffs  ] that [ORG Boeing  ] is still trying to assess what the immediate future holds for [MISC Varig  ] after the carrier 's recent move to obtain bankruptcy protection . 
While under [MISC Brazilian  ] law the company has until August to file a reorganization plan and is immune until December from creditor suits to repossess assets , [PER Sicilia  ] noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] federal district court injunction barring creditors from foreclosing expires on September 12 -- at which point it is unclear what would happen . 
In the end , if [MISC Varig  ] is unable to secure a debt-swap with the [ORG GOB  ] ( Ref A ) , then [PER Sicilia  ] thinks it unlikely that the airline will survive . 
Given the political scandals in which the [PER Lula  ] administration is currently enmeshed ( Ref B ) , to avoid the accumulation of bad news the [ORG GOB  ] may try to delay resolution of the [LOC Varig  ] crisis until after the next presidential election . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) This cable includes business confidential information and should be handled accordingly. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On July 1 , [ORG Boeing Sales  ] Director for [LOC Brazil  ] , [PER Jose Sicilia  ] , met with [MISC EconOffs  ] and [ORG Foreign Commercial Service  ] staff in [LOC Brasilia  ] and had a candid discussion of the [LOC Varig  ] crisis . 
[PER Sicilia  ] , who at times plays the role of the " advocate " for [MISC Varig  ] in [ORG Boeing  ] , noted that [ORG Boeing  ] has had a long history of working with the airline . 
Although in the past [ORG Boeing  ] has forgiven some of [LOC Varig  ] 's debts ( in exchange for an exclusivity contract ) , [PER Sicilia  ] considered the business relationship with [LOC Varig  ] very positive over the years . 
Indeed , he observed , if [LOC Varig  ] puts together a good recovery plan , [ORG Boeing  ] will fight for [MISC Varig  ] to survive . 
Nevertheless , [PER Sicilia  ] stated , the company has to consider the interests of its leasing subsidiaries [ORG Boeing Capital Corporation  ] ( [ORG BCC  ] ) and [ORG Boeing Asset Management  ] ( [ORG BAM  ] ) , both of which were more interested in cutting their losses than in looking to future sales . 
[PER Sicilia  ] informed us that [ORG Boeing  ] had been considering pulling its leased planes , but that [ORG IFLC  ] had moved first ( Ref C ) . 
Given the popularity of [LOC Varig  ] in [LOC Brazil  ] , [ORG Boeing  ] didn't want to be the " bad guy " who took [LOC Varig  ] down . 
( According to [PER Sicilia  ] , [ORG Varig has  ] 29 different lessors , the biggest of which are [ORG Boeing  ] , [ORG IFLC  ] , ANCET , GATX , and [LOC Bristol  ] . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) A group of high-level [ORG Boeing  ] executives , including [ORG BCC  ] and [ORG BAM  ] , will be meeting with the [ORG Varig Board  ] the week of July 4 at [ORG Varig President  ] [PER David Zylbersztjan  ] 's request . 
[PER Sicilia  ] predicted that the meeting will be mostly pleasantries , but that if [LOC Varig  ] says something " wrong " ( such as indicating it won't be able to make current payments ) , that [ORG Boeing  ] may begin its lease termination planning . 
In the final analysis , [PER Sicilia  ] believes the crux is whether the [ORG GOB  ] will allow a debt-swap or not ; if not , he said there is little hope that [ORG Varig  ] can attract investors or survive . 
( On July 7 , [PER Varig  ] announced that [PER Henrique Nieves  ] had stepped down as president to manage the debt restructuring operations and [PER Omar Carneiro  ] da [PER Cunha  ] , who was the VP , would assume the presidency of the airline . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) If [ORG Varig  ] goes belly-up , [PER Sicilia  ] thinks that most of its domestic routes would be filled relatively easily by other [MISC Brazilian  ] carriers . 
Given the greater difficulties in operating overseas and the need to acquire slots at foreign airports , the international routes would be more complicated to fill . 
Overall , he considered transferring [ORG Varig  ] 's leased planes and service infrastructure into [ORG TAM  ] the best option for filling the service gap quickly . 
However , since [ORG TAM  ] has an [MISC Airbus  ] fleet and no support infrastructure for [ORG Boeing  ] 's planes , [PER Sicilia  ] isn't sure such a transfer would materialize . 
While cut-rate airline [ORG GOL  ] operates [ORG Boeing  ] planes , and has more cash available , [PER Sicilia  ] said [ORG GOL  ] doesn't have authorization to fly wide-body planes , and that in general its low-cost carrier model wouldn't work as well on international routes . 
In addition , [ORG GOL  ] has already gone in another direction internationally as it announced this week the signing of an MOU to establish a low-cost carrier in [LOC Mexico  ] as well as code sharing plans with [ORG Air France  ] and [ORG Delta.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment . 
[ORG Varig  ] 's bankruptcy filing has bought it some breathing room , but may only postpone the inevitable . 
[ORG Boeing  ] 's [PER Sicilia  ] was clearly trying to be upbeat about the future even though he admitted the situation was bleak . 
We think it highly unlikely that the recovery plan will be sorted out by the September court date . 
But , given the current political crisis , neither does the [PER Lula  ] administration want the demise of Varig on its hands . 
We look for the [ORG GOB  ] to try to kick the can down the road , which could happen if [LOC Brazil  ] 's judiciary extended the foreclosure prohibition period for 180 days and [LOC U.S.  ] courts followed suit , thus preventing the lessors from seizing their leased aircraft .
