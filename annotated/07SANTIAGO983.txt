( C ) [PER Hugo Chavez  ] , s effort to expand his influence into the [ORG Southern Cone  ] was the subject of ref [PER A. This  ] , part two in a series of joint cables from [ORG Southern Cone  ] embassies , looks at ways the [LOC U.S.  ] can counter [PER Chavez  ] and reassert [LOC U.S.  ] leadership in the region . 
From posts' perspectives , there are six main areas of action for the [ORG USG  ] as it seeks to limit [PER Chavez  ] 's influence: --Know the enemy: We have to better understand how [PER Chavez  ] thinks and what he intends ; --Directly engage: We must reassert our presence in the region , and engage broadly , especially with the " non-elites " ; --Change the political landscape: We should offer a vision of hope and back it up with adequately-funded programs ; --Enhance military relationships: We should continue to strengthen ties to those military leaders in the region who share our concern over [PER Chavez  ] ; --Play to our strength: We must emphasize that democracy , and a free trade approach that includes corporate social responsibility , provides lasting solutions ; --Get the message out: Public diplomacy is key ; this is a battle of ideas and visions . 
Septel provides detailed suggestions . 
2 . 
( C ) We should neither underestimate [PER Chavez  ] nor lose sight of his vulnerabilities . 
Many of the region 's leaders and opnion makers appreciate the importance of relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] and generally want to see us more deeply engaged . 
They reject the notion that [PER Chavez  ] best represents the region 's interests . 
We must convince not only government leaders but civil society - the person on the street - that we are committed to a progressive and democractic vision for the [ORG Americas  ] and to helping our neighbors meet their challenges . 
If we can , we will make quick inroads into marginalizing [MISC Chavez'  ] influence , bolster democracy and reassert our own leadership in the region . 
End Summary. -------------- Know Thy Enemy -------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S/NF ) Notwithstanding his tirades and antics , it would be a mistake to dismiss [PER Hugo Chavez  ] as just a clown or old school caudillo . 
He has a vision , however distorted , and he is taking calculated measures to advance it . 
To effectively counter the threat he represents , we need to know better his objectives and how he intends to pursue them . 
This requires better intelligence in all of our countries . 
Embassy [ORG Asuncion  ] , s getting hold of [PER Chavez  ] 's [ORG MSP  ] equivalent , for example , and then sharing it with policy makers and implementers in [LOC Washington  ] and the region helps inform and coordinate our response . 
4 . 
( S/NF ) When we have concrete intelligence on an issue about which our friends in the region share our concern -- e.g. , [LOC Venezuela  ] 's relationship with [LOC Iran  ] -- we should share it to the extent we can . 
And when [PER Chavez  ] 's programs feed local elite appetites for corruption or otherwise fail to deliver on their promises , we need to make it known. --------------- Directly Engage --------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) We must challenge the mistaken notion that the [LOC U.S.  ] is absent and aloof from the region . 
President [PER Bush  ] 's visit to five countries in the region in March , and his follow-on meeting with President [PER Lula  ] at [LOC Camp David  ] , made a hugely positive impression . 
[PER A/S Shannon  ] 's April visit to [LOC Chile  ] and [LOC Paraguay  ] was similarly applauded by local leaders and the press . 
We need to build on this good will with a regular stream of senior-level visits , including by Cabinet members , speaking to our positive agenda for the region and producing concrete programs and agreements that respond to its problems . 
6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) To obtain the greatest return on these visits , we encourage [LOC Washington  ] to explore multiple-country itineraries . 
When we make these visits , it is important we be seen not just with government officials and elites , but also with those who have been marginalized or are on the fringes of society . 
We need visits not only to those countries where leaders praise us , but even more importantly where governments have distanced themselves from us . 
In these places , showing the flag and explaining directly to populations our view of democracy and progress can change views about the [LOC U.S.  ] that may have become distorted or out of date. ------------------------------ Change the Political Landscape ------------------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [MISC Chavez'  ] agenda is about expanding his influence and power , using the " [MISC Bolivarian Revolution  ] " as his vehicle . 
This rubs a lot of the region 's governmental and non-governmental leaders and opinion makers the wrong way -- particularly those who don't want to be associated with his methods or regard [PER Chavez  ] as a growing threat to their own leadership . 
We have to play to that resentment by strengthening our ties with these leaders , praising their governance , and fostering broad public respect for the progressive models they are seeking to build within their societies . 
Fortunately , local " case studies " of countries that are leftist-led but are democratic and fiscally responsible offer glistening counterpoints to [PER Chavez  ] 's retrograde project . 
-- Because of its sheer size and economic weight , [LOC Brazil  ] has outsized influence over the rest of the continent . 
In this regard , it can be a powerful counterpoint to [PER Chavez  ] 's project . 
We should help present [LOC Brazil  ] 's course -- i.e. , pursuit of fiscal responsibility and strong democratic institutions , openness to the global the community , and mature engagement with both its neighbors and the [LOC U.S.  ] -- as a progressive and hopeful model for the region . 
-- [LOC Chile  ] offers another excellent alternative to [PER Chavez  ] . 
FM [LOC Foxley  ] seeks to integrate [LOC Chile  ] more fully into the global economy . 
[LOC Chile  ] has not only stated but demonstrated -- e.g . 
[PER Bachelet  ] 's letter to [ORG House  ] leader [PER Nancy Pelosi  ] expressing [MISC Chilean  ] support for congressional ratification of [LOC FTAs  ] with [LOC Peru  ] , [LOC Colombia  ] , and [LOC Panama  ] -- its willingness to help bring along other [MISC Latin American  ] countries into the global economy . 
We should look to find other ways to give [LOC Chile  ] the lead on important initiatives , but without making them look like they are our puppets or surrogates . 
-- [LOC Argentina  ] is more complex , but still presents distinct characteristics that should inform our approach to countering [PER Chavez  ] 's influence there . 
[LOC Argentina  ] has a large middle class and a vibrant civil society open to our ideas and vision of a market-based democracy and wary of [PER Chavez  ] 's " revolutions . 
" [LOC Venezuela  ] does not appear to have provided [LOC Argentina  ] any significant subsidies or outright grants , but [PER Chavez  ] has been able to exploit [LOC Buenos Aires  ] , lack of access to investment capital and international financing . 
Domestic and foreign investors are not providing adequate long-term investment capital to quickly develop needed infrastructure . 
And still unresolved post-crisis defaults on official [ORG Paris Club  ] and private bondholder debt are restricting [LOC Argentina  ] 's access to the volume of new sovereign credits in global capital markets it would need to fund infrastructure development on its own . 
The obvious counter to the influence that [MISC Chavez'  ] financial support has bought him in [LOC Argentina  ] is to help the [ORG GoA  ] regain direct access to international financial markets and to work with the [ORG GoA  ] to develop the kind of investment climate that will attract the volume of domestic and foreign investment needed to build new foundational infrastructure at competitive costs . 
This needs to be complemented by engaging actively with civil society and key non-economic actors in the government on areas of shared concern ( anti-crime , anti-terror , peacekeeping , etc . 
) . 
-- Our growing economic relationship with the pragmatic leftist government in [LOC Uruguay  ] puts the lie to the claim that greater trade and investment with the [LOC U.S.  ] is tantamount to betrayal of local populations . 
This is critical because poor countries , like [LOC Uruguay  ] , are vulnerable not so much to [PER Chavez  ] , s ideology but to his petrobolivars . 
We need to draw attention to and build on these success stories borne out of engagement with the [LOC U.S.  ] , as alternatives to [MISC Chavez'  ] vision of a region cut off from the [LOC U.S.  ] Even [LOC Paraguay  ] 's leftist priest-turned presidential candidate [PER Fernando Lugo  ] has stated he is closer to [PER Bachelet  ] or [PER Lula  ] than to [PER Chavez.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Of course , we also need to make sure that the truth about [PER Chavez  ] -- his hollow vision , his empty promises , his dangerous international relationships starting with [LOC Iran  ] ) -- gets out , always exercising careful judgment about where and how we take on [PER Chavez  ] directly/publicly . 
While it remains preferable that we take the high road focusing attention on our " vision of hope of hope and prosperity for the region , " there will continue to be times we need to speak out on the concerns his authoritarian bent raises . 
However , we shouldn't be alone nor necessarily always in the lead . 
Rather the [MISC NGO  ] community and local civil society groups , the region 's leaders and international organizations , the [ORG UN  ] and [ORG OAS  ] in particular , must assume a greater role in addressing this problem and put [PER Chavez  ] on the defensive -- not by exaggerating the threat but speaking to the facts . 
The recent closing of [ORG RCTV  ] is one such area where international organizations and local media and civil rights groups could have been more vocal . 
9 . 
( C ) With regard to [PER Mercosur  ] , we should not be timid in stating that [LOC Venezuela  ] 's membership will torpedo [LOC U.S.  ] interest in even considering direct negotiations with the trading bloc , and in questioning when and how [PER Mercosur  ] plans to apply its democracy clause strictures to [PER Chavez  ] 's regime . 
Without voicing hostility to [PER Mercosur  ] per se , we can continue to pursue [ORG FTA  ] 's with interested countries , and encourage alterative arrangements , such as [LOC Chile  ] , s " [ORG Arco  ] del [PER Pacifico  ] " initiative. ----------------------------- Play to our Mil-Mil Advantage ----------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [ORG Southern Cone  ] militaries remain key institutions in their respective countries and important allies for the [LOC U.S.  ] These militaries are generally organized and technically competent . 
Their desire to maintain interoperability , access to [LOC U.S.  ] technology and training are something we can turn to our advantage . 
As they seek to modernize , professionalize , and transform , they seek closer relations with the [LOC US  ] to assist in those processes . 
Over the past several years we have seen a steady decrease in funds for critical programs such as [ORG International Military Education and Training  ] ( [ORG IMET  ] ) and traditional [ORG Commander Activities  ] ( [ORG TCA  ] ) and the elimination of other important programs such as [ORG Foreign Military Financing  ] ( [ORG FMF  ] ) and Excess Defense Articles ( [ORG EDA  ] ) due to sanctions under [ORG ASPA  ] . 
To effectively maintain our mil-to-mil relations and guide pol-mil events in the region in support of our interests , we must reverse the slide . 
Now is precisely the time we need to be increasing our pol-mil engagement and programs vice decreasing and limiting them . 
We also need to revisit some long-held and frankly rigid positions on [MISC SOFA  ] agreements and insistence on certain privileges and immunities with a view to gaining flexibility to negotiate new defense cooperation agreements with regional militaries. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) An increasingly unifying theme that completely excludes [PER Chavez  ] , and isolates [LOC Venezuela  ] among the militaries and security forces of the region , is participation in international and regional peacekeeping operations . 
The [ORG Southern Cone  ] is doing very well in this area , with all countries active contributors to [ORG PKO  ] missions worldwide . 
[LOC Argentina  ] and [LOC Chile  ] have even formed a combined peacekeeping brigade , which is expected to be available for deployment sometime in 2008 . 
[LOC Uruguay  ] is the highest per-capita contributor of [ORG PKO  ] troops . 
We should make more [ORG GPOI  ] funds available to [ORG Southern Cone  ] countries to increase and strengthen their peacekeeping capabilities and cooperation . 
Additionally , we should explore using the mechanism that the region 's contributors to [ORG MINUSTAH  ] ( [LOC Haiti  ] ) have established to discuss ways of increasing peacekeeping cooperation on a broader scale. -------------------------- Stress Our Winning [MISC Formula  ] -------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Chavez  ] has made significant inroads , particularly with local populations , by providing programs for the underprivileged and by casting the [LOC U.S.  ] as elitist and only interested in promoting free trade to the benefit of big business . 
The slogans are facile: Neoliberalism makes the rich richer and the poor poorer ; the [MISC Bolivarian  ] Revolution guarantees our region 's sovereignty and dignity . 
But they ring true with some local populations and make others feel better about their own lack of progress. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Transforming our image does not mean we walk away from our commitment to free trade and the promise it delivers to impoverished populations . 
However , it does mean we should do a better job of promoting free trade by pointing to local and global success stories , making it easier to forge FTAs , and by expanding access to [LOC U.S.  ] markets , and by promoting investment . 
Concluding the [LOC Doha Round  ] is critical to revitalizing more local trade negotiations and bolstering our own credibility . 
In the meantime , we should support programs that promote regional exports , particularly favoring small and medium-size enterprises , and emphasize good corporate citizenship. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) We must also emphasize social responsibility among corporations and investors , and as a USG priority . 
President [PER Bush  ] 's March 5 speech about social justice struck a chord throughout the region . 
We should be seen standing with local populations , delivering programs that speak directly to their economic and social needs , particularly in the areas of health and education . 
This is vital not only in the poorer countries , but equally in places like [LOC Chile  ] and [LOC Argentina  ] , where our very small community and youth action programs are welcomed and receive excellent media attention. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Projects which foster greater transparency and democracy are important ; they empower local citizens , strengthen democratic institutions , and contribute to a foundation for growth . 
When it comes to programs , there is no getting around the fact that we must back up policies with more resources to counteract [PER Chavez  ] , s easy walking around money , which is making a huge impact in countries like [LOC Uruguay  ] . 
[PER Chavez  ] isn't waging his campaign simply on rhetoric . 
He is investing millions in his campaign for the hearts and minds . 
We can use greater discretion and use our funds in a more strategic , targeted manner , but we aren't going to transform the perception that we are not committed seriously to this region by waging our own campaign on the cheap. ----------------------- Getting the Message Out ----------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( U ) Public diplomacy will be absolutely vital to our success . 
We cannot win in the marketplace of ideas unless we have active and effective outreach , especially to the young and those active in addressing social ills and education needs . 
Embassy [LOC Santiago  ] septel addresses many PD areas in which we could be more active . 
People-to-people contact at the grassroots level with local leaders , [ORG NGOs  ] , youth groups , community activists , and cooperatives is key. ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) As [PER Chavez  ] seeks to take on the mantle of this generation , s [PER Castro  ] , he starts with built-in advantages , not the least of which is a whole lot of money . 
Add to that the bluster of his anti-imperial , anti-U.S. rhetoric , and a certain squirrelly charisma , both of which continue to find a sympathetic audience in much of [LOC Latin America  ] , and he presents a formidable foe . 
But he certainly can be taken . 
[LOC Washington  ] policy-makers have already hit on one sure-fire tactic: [PER Don  ] , t fire back at every provocation , especially when it , s clear that [PER Chavez  ] , s mouth has opened before his brain has engaged . 
His recent dust-ups with both the [MISC Brazilian  ] and [MISC Chilean  ] senates over the [ORG RCTV  ] closure are examples where [PER Chavez  ] , s ranting lost him points with ostensible friends without our having to lift a finger. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) But we cannot hope for [PER Chavez  ] , s blunders alone to derail him in the [ORG Southern Cone  ] . 
Hence the package of measures we propose: A more muscular USG presence in the region that builds on high-level visits , underscores the strengths of viable , successful alternatives ( i.e. , [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Chile  ] ) to [PER Chavez  ] , s brand of socialism , targets enhanced resources to regions and populations beyond the elites , and which uses public diplomacy to make our message loud and clear - democracy , freer trade and investment , work and that along with that come active and effective programs to address social ills and the needs of the region 's youthful population . 
Enough said . 
End comment .
