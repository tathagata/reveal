( U ) This is an action request: see paragraph 3. ------- Summary ------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Per reftel and other information , the [ORG Government of Israel  ] ( [ORG GOI  ] ) is concerned that [LOC Syria  ] intends to imminently transfer SCUD-D missiles to [ORG Hizballah  ] in [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
We share this concern . 
The transfer of such weapons would constitute a significant escalation of a potentially volatile situation that could threaten regional stability . 
Embassy is requested to demarche [ORG SARG  ] officials at the highest possible level to communicate the points below and report responses via front channel cable . 
[ORG NEA  ] will deliver the same points to the [MISC Syrian  ] Ambassador upon his return to [LOC Washington  ] . 
End summary. -------------- Action Request -------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/REL  ] [LOC SYRIA  ] ) Post is requested to use the following points in demarching the [ORG SARG  ] on the imminent missile transfers to [ORG Hizballah  ] . 
[PER Begin  ] points: -- Mr. Vice Minister , [LOC Washington  ] has asked me to follow up on an issue that Under Secretary [PER Burns  ] raised privately with President [PER Asad  ] last week . 
We are growing increasingly concerned about the risk of a regional military conflict -- one that could have dire consequences for [LOC Syria  ] . 
We believe it is in our mutual interests that we share our concerns with you again . 
-- Just weeks ago , we saw how the war of words between yourself , Foreign Minister [PER Muallim  ] and the [MISC Israelis  ] could have quickly escalated out of control . 
President [PER Asad  ] assured [PER U/S Burns  ] that [LOC Syria  ] had no interest in escalating the potential for conflict with [LOC Israel  ] . 
With that assurance , we want to discuss with you frankly two increasingly worrisome issues that we believe could spark the next conflict . 
-- First , we are concerned about [LOC Syria  ] 's provision of increasingly sophisticated weapons to [ORG Hizballah  ] . 
In our meetings last week it was stated that [LOC Syria  ] is not transferring any " new " missiles to [MISC Lebanese  ] [ORG Hizballah  ] . 
We are aware , however , of current [MISC Syrian  ] efforts to supply [ORG Hizballah  ] with ballistic missiles . 
I must stress that this activity is of deep concern to my government , and we strongly caution you against such a serious escalation . 
-- Next , we are concerned that [ORG Hizballah  ] is still planning an operation to avenge the death of [PER Imad Mughniyeh  ] . 
While [ORG Hizballah  ] may be willing to risk a renewal of the 2006 conflict , it does not seem to be in [LOC Syria  ] 's interest to accept that risk . 
-- While [LOC Syria  ] 's influence over [ORG Hizballah  ] 's operational decision-making may be limited , the political reality is such that a major escalation would surely complicate our efforts to improve our bilateral relationship , and undermine our efforts to build political conditions conducive for re-launching [LOC Middle East  ] peace negotiations . 
We therefore urge you to use whatever influence you have to avoid such a scenario . 
-- Your interest in avoiding war should require you to exert maximum restraint , including restraining [ORG Hizballah  ] and preventing the group 's acquisition of such lethal , long-range weapons . 
-- [LOC Iran  ] and [ORG Hizballah  ] both have interests that are not in [LOC Syria  ] 's own strategic interest . 
I know you are a strategic thinker , which is why I want to underscore for you that , from our perspective , your operational support for [ORG Hizballah  ] is a strategic miscalculation that is damaging your long-term national interests . 
End points .
