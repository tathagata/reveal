( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Summary:  ] During recent meetings , [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi 's staff has shown an increased interest in bilateral military and security issues , particularly requests linked to Captain [LOC Khamis  ] al-Qadhafi , including purchases of helicopters and " [MISC Tiger  ] " vehicle components , and [MISC M113  ] refurbishment . 
[PER Saif  ] 's staff also indicated [LOC Libya  ] was interested in purchasing [MISC French  ] [ORG SCALP  ] cruise missiles to replace its [MISC SCUD  ] Bs . 
This increased attention may be reflective of [PER Saif  ] 's broader plans to consolidate military and security issues within his expanding " General Coordinator " portfolio . 
[PER Saif  ] 's staff declined to comment on any future division of responsibility between [PER Saif  ] al-Islam and [ORG Mutassim  ] al-Qadhafi in these areas . 
The clear interest in military sales represented by [PER Saif  ] 's staff on behalf of [LOC Khamis  ] al-Qadhafi may be indicative of [PER Saif  ] 's attempts to curry his youngest brother 's favor . 
End Summary . 
[PER Saif  ] 's aide advocates on behalf of khamis <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) xxxxxxxxxxxx meetings with Pol/Econ Chief and DATT , xxxxxxxxxxxx [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi , expressed interest in military equipment sales , particularly purchase requests from [LOC Khamis  ] al-Qadhafi 's 32nd [MISC Brigade.  ] xxxxxxxxxxxx labeled " strange " the " broad " list of equipment requests made by [ORG National Security Advisor Mutassim  ] al-Qadhafi to the [ORG Department of Defense  ] earlier this year , and focused discussion on [MISC Libyan  ] military requests for helicopters and vehicles -- requests that likely derived from the " [MISC Khamis Brigade  ] . 
" xxxxxxxxxxxx sought an explanation on the [ORG USG  ] refusal of the sale of [ORG Little Bird  ] helicopters to the [MISC Libyan  ] military , and designated for the " [MISC Khamis Brigade  ] . 
" Stating that the [MISC Libyan  ] military was still very interested in purchasing the aircraft , he suggested the helicopters have all armament removed so they could be categorized as " non-lethal equipment . 
" DATT informed him that the [MISC Libyan  ] military was free to purchase a number of other helicopter systems that the [ORG Defense Security Cooperation Agency  ] had already cleared for [MISC Libyan  ] military purchase. xxxxxxxxxxxx insisted that the [MISC Libyan  ] military wanted to purchase the [ORG Little Bird  ] helicopters. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Additionally , xxxxxxxxxxxx requested an update on the status of the license request by a jointly owned [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Turkish  ] company to refurbish [LOC Libya  ] 's fleet of [MISC M113  ] vehicles , in which [LOC Khamis  ] al-Qadhafi had expressed a personal interest . 
He asked emboffs to provide him with a written update on the status of the request , which he would then pass to [LOC Khamis.  ] xxxxxxxxxxxx then reiterated a [ORG GOL  ] complaint ( which [PER Saif  ] had raised with the Ambassador on November 27 , ref A ) that a [MISC UAE  ] company could not meet the requirements for the sale of a fleet of [MISC Jordanian  ] " [MISC Tiger  ] " 4x4 vehicles to the [MISC Libyan  ] military , as the [LOC U.S.  ] manufacturer of the vehicles' engines would not approve the sale . 
DATT informed xxxxxxxxxxxx that , per discussions with the manufacturer , it was that company 's policy , not [LOC U.S.  ] law , that prohibited the sale of equipment to the Government of [LOC Libya  ] . 
" We have a long way to go , " retorted xxxxxxxxxxxx . 
He stated that if the [MISC UAE  ] could not outfit the [MISC Tiger  ] vehicles with [MISC American  ] engines , then the [MISC Libyans  ] would purchase engines from [ORG Mercedes-Benz  ] . 
" But we want [MISC American  ] engines , " he added . 
DATT extended the possibility that [MISC Libyan  ] military procurement provide a Letter of Request to purchase the engines via the Foreign Military Sales process , which xxxxxxxxxxxx said he would discuss with the appropriate officials. xxxxxxxxxxxx to follow up on military engagement offers <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In addition to the three issues raised , DATT educated xxxxxxxxxxxx on the five pending Letters of Offer and Assistance ( [ORG LOA  ] ) that have been held up in [LOC Libya  ] 's military procurement office for several months , all of which focus on [MISC C-130  ] related purchases and refurbishment requests , as well as the full range of military exchange and training opportunities that have been offered to the [MISC Libyans  ] over the last year . 
While xxxxxxxxxxxx did not show interest in the [MISC C-130  ] LOAs , he seemed surprised by the number of military exchange and training opportunities on offer and was particularly shocked that most of them had gone unanswered . 
" Who did you make these offers to ? 
" he asked . 
He took particular interest in an offer made for [LOC Khamis  ] to travel around the [LOC United States  ] to tour [LOC U.S.  ] military installations and pledged to follow-up directly with [LOC Khamis  ] on that program . 
[LOC Libya  ] potentially identifies scud b replacement system <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Separating the topic as one that was " political " as well as " military , " xxxxxxxxxxxx emboffs that the [MISC Libyans  ] may have found an [MISC MTCR-compliant  ] " replacement system " for its stock of [MISC SCUD  ] B missiles . 
He explained that the [ORG GOL  ] had discussed , [ORG Tripoli  ] 00000960 002.2 of 002 during a recent high-level [MISC French  ] visit , the purchase of the [MISC French  ] [ORG SCALP  ] Missile ( a.k.a . 
" [LOC Storm Shadow  ] " ) to replace the [MISC SCUD  ] <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B. xxxxxxxxxxxx asked whether the [ORG USG  ] would consider the equipment [MISC MTCR-compliant  ] , and if so , whether the [ORG USG  ] would bless the sale . 
Emboffs offered to pass the information to [LOC Washington  ] for guidance . 
" How soon do you think you will know ? 
" he asked . 
We told him we would follow-up as soon as we had more information for him . 
( Note: The [ORG SCALP Missile  ] is an air launched cruise-launched missile , fired from [MISC Rafale  ] as well as other combat aircraft . 
From a separate source , DATT learned December 10 that although [LOC France  ] is keen to sell [MISC Rafale  ] jets to [LOC Libya  ] , it is not interested in selling the [MISC Libyans  ] the [ORG SCALP Missile  ] , which is deemed " too sensitive . 
" End note . 
) Security role for saif ? <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) When asked whether [PER Saif  ] would be the point person for military and security issues if and when he takes on his new position as " General Coordinator , " xxxxxxxxxxxx -- that the Embassy should continue to track military-related issues through [ORG Mutassim  ] 's office xxxxxxxxxxxx from now on. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Comment:  ] The concerted attention that xxxxxxxxxxxx devoted to military and security issues during recent meetings with Emboffs suggests that [PER Saif  ] is beginning to insert himself into the political-military and security spheres . 
The discussion of [LOC Khamis'  ] requests in particular may indicate that [PER Saif  ] is trying to curry favor with his little brother . 
Given the fact that the " [MISC Khamis Brigade  ] " is considered the best-equipped and most capable of defending the regime , it seems only natural that anyone intent on assuming power would try to align himself with [LOC Khamis.  ] xxxxxxxxxxxx cautious advice to continue to track military and security issues through [ORG Mutassim  ] 's office seems to indicate that [PER Saif  ] 's interest in these issues is still informal and perhaps not fully vetted within the [MISC Libyan  ] government .
