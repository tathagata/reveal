( C ) SUMMARY: Secstate Legal Adviser [PER John Bellinger  ] met with a comprehensive array of [ORG EU  ] interlocutors in [LOC Brussels  ] on February 7-8 to discuss [LOC U.S.  ] views on the legal framework for the war on terrorism . 
He stressed that [LOC U.S.  ] decisions on how to deal with an unprecedented global terrorist threat had been made after serious consideration of all legal and political options , and that [MISC European  ] officials must publicly underline [MISC U.S.-EU  ] solidarity in the fight against terror . 
On [ORG Guantanamo  ] detainees and [ORG Al Qaeda  ] , [PER Bellinger  ] argued that the [LOC U.S.  ] was and is acting in the context of a new form of international armed conflict , and that therefore , while the [ORG Geneva Conventions  ] do not fit this new situation well , the rules of war provide a more appropriate framework than domestic criminal law . 
He discussed [MISC European  ] concerns about the treatment of detainees . 
[PER Bellinger  ] also argued that rendition is a vital tool against terror . 
Finally , he urged the [ORG EU  ] not to support a [MISC Cuban  ] resolution at the [ORG UN Human Rights Commission  ] on [ORG Guantanamo  ] . 
The [ORG EU  ] response to the visit was for the most part extremely positive , with the Legal Adviser of the [MISC Austrian  ] [ORG EU  ] presidency underlining that " the fight against terror is our ( shared ) struggle . 
" [MISC Europeans  ] , however , remain concerned about protection issues . 
END SUMMARY. ----------------------------- COMPREHENSIVE SET OF MEETINGS ----------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On February 7-8 , Secretary of State Legal Adviser [PER John Bellinger  ] met with a wide range of [ORG EU  ] and member-state officials , including [PER Robert Cooper  ] , [PER Director-General  ] for Common Foreign and [ORG Security Policy  ] at the [ORG EU  ] Council Secretariat ; [PER Jean-Claude Piris  ] , the [PER Director-General  ] of the [ORG SIPDIS Legal Services  ] of the [ORG EU  ] Council Secretariat ; [PER Michel Petite  ] , [PER Director-General  ] of the [ORG Legal Services  ] of the [ORG European Commission  ] ; [PER Jim Cloos  ] , [ORG EU  ] Council Secretariat Director for [MISC Transatlantic Relations  ] , [ORG Human Rights  ] and [ORG UN  ] ; and [PER Gijs de Vries  ] , [ORG EU  ] Coordinator for the [ORG Fight Against Terrorism  ] . 
The visit was capped by a two-and-a-half-hour discussion with the [ORG EU  ] Legal Services Working Group ( [ORG COJUR  ] ) , comprising the [ORG MFA Legal Advisers  ] of the 25 [ORG EU  ] member states , plus [ORG Commission  ] and [ORG Council Legal Services  ] and [MISC Romanian  ] and [MISC Bulgarian  ] observers. -------------------------------------------- BASIC CONTEXT: UNPRECEDENTED GLOBAL CONFLICT -------------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Bellinger  ] stressed that the situation in which the [LOC U.S.  ] and its allies find themselves is unprecedented -- faced with thousands of [ORG Al Qaeda  ] and associated terrorists around the globe whose goal is to inflict mass casualties on innocent civilians by any means possible . 
The legal frameworks that are readily available , the [ORG Geneva Conventions  ] or domestic criminal law , do not fit this unprecedented situation well . 
In this context , the [ORG USG  ] has thought long and hard about how best to prosecute the conflict thrust upon it in a way that is politically and legally legitimate , and the answer to the question of what the rules should be that govern the war on terror is not an easy one. ------------------------------------------ INTERNATIONAL ARMED CONFLICT WITH [ORG AL QAEDA  ] ------------------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) It is clear , [PER Bellinger  ] said , that the military response against the [ORG Taliban  ] and [ORG Al Qaeda  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] following the September 11 attacks , an action covered by [ORG UNSC Resolution  ] 1373 , is properly categorized as an international armed conflict . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] believes that the continuing struggle against [ORG Al Qaeda  ] remains a legal state of international armed conflict . 
[ORG Al Qaeda  ] has attacked , and continues to attack , our ships , embassies , people , and territory . 
Its leaders have explicitly declared war on us . 
Therefore , the proper legal framework cannot be that of domestic criminal law . 
[ORG Al Qaeda  ] is not the same as domestic [MISC European  ] terrorist groups like the [ORG IRA  ] or [ORG RAF  ] because it is global and operates outside the [LOC U.S.  ] and across borders . 
It is in effect a new manifestation on the battlefield , that of " armies of terrorists . 
" Conceptually , this is a military conflict , not a police action to round up criminals . 
Most detainees have been picked up by our armed forces on foreign battlefields . 
Practically , these cases would be virtually impossible for domestic courts to handle , since there are rarely witnesses , statements , or forensic or documentary evidence that would meet domestic standards . 
Accordingly , the most appropriate framework would be the rules of international armed conflict. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) It is important to note , [PER Bellinger  ] emphasized , the distinction between the President 's political statement that we are part of a " war on terror " and the legal status of the international armed conflict with [ORG Al Qaeda  ] . 
When the President speaks of the War on Terror after 9/11 , he is taking the position that we must all declare our opposition to terrorism of any kind . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] also believes , however , that it has been and continues to be in a legal state of armed conflict specifically with [ORG Al Qaeda.  ] ---------------------------------------- DETAINEES COVERED BY [ORG GENEVA CONVENTIONS  ] ? ---------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Bellinger  ] stressed that the current rules of international armed conflict do not fit this unprecedented situation very well . 
After 9/11 , the [LOC U.S.  ] carefully considered whether and to what extent the [ORG Geneva Conventions  ] would apply . 
[ORG Article  ] 2 of the [ORG Third Geneva Convention  ] declares that these conventions apply only between High Contracting Parties . 
While [LOC Afghanistan  ] was a High Contracting Party , [ORG Al Qaeda  ] is certainly not . 
In addition , [ORG Article  ] 4 dictates that a POW must be a soldier in a national army , wear a uniform with marked insignia , carry arms openly , and follow the laws and customs of war . 
Because the [ORG Taliban  ] did not meet any of these conditions , they are not covered as POWs under the [ORG Geneva Conventions  ] . 
Furthermore , [ORG Al Qaeda  ] members could not be considered " protected persons " under the [ORG Fourth Geneva Convention  ] . 
The [ORG Fourth Convention  ] defines " protected persons " as civilians caught up in a conflict . 
[ORG Al Qaeda  ] was not caught up in , but rather initiated , the conflict . 
[PER Bellinger  ] noted that privileges are given to POWs under the [ORG Geneva Conventions  ] for following the laws of war , which are intended to protect civilians from harm . 
[ORG Al Qaeda  ] and the [ORG Taliban  ] completely disregard the rules of war and intentionally target civilians. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) If not covered as POWs or protected persons , what , then , is the status of [ORG Al Qaeda  ] and [ORG Taliban  ] combatants ? 
[PER Bellinger  ] asserted that there is a clear gap between these terms , and that the gap is intentional . 
[ORG Article  ] 5 of the [ORG Fourth Geneva Convention  ] , he notes , specifies that " spies and saboteurs " are not granted rights and privileges under the [ORG Geneva Conventions  ] . 
This designation , " spies and saboteurs , " is the designation in the [ORG Geneva Conventions  ] that most closely describes [ORG Al Qaeda  ] terrorists . 
Thus , though they are combatants , they are best defined as unlawful combatants who do not have a right to any protections under the [ORG Geneva Conventions  ] . 
[PER Bellinger  ] also explained that the term &unlawful combatant8 is not a new term but rather has been used for many years in treatises and military manuals to describe those who engage in combat , but in an unlawful manner. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Bellinger  ] added that the [LOC U.S.  ] response to [ORG Al Qaeda  ] attacks does not make members of [ORG Al Qaeda  ] legitimate combatants under the [ORG Geneva Conventions  ] . 
[ORG Al Qaeda  ] does not follow the laws of war , and the fact that the [LOC U.S.  ] is fighting back in no way renders unlawful combatants legitimate under the very laws they do not respect. ------------------------------------ STANDARDS FOR TREATMENT OF DETAINEES ------------------------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) If the protections of the [ORG Geneva Conventions  ] do not apply , [PER Bellinger  ] said , there is the question of what rules the [LOC U.S.  ] is applying to detainees . 
Accordingly , to clarify [LOC U.S.  ] policy towards detainees President [PER Bush  ] issued a public directive on February 7 , 2002 , titled " [ORG Humane Treatment  ] of [ORG Al Qaeda  ] and [ORG Taliban  ] Detainees . 
" This directive orders that all detainees under the control of the [ORG Armed Forces  ] be treated humanely and , to the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity , consistent with the [ORG Geneva Conventions  ] . 
In addition , the [LOC U.S.  ] remains bound by , and committed to , the [ORG United Nations Convention Against Torture  ] and [PER Other Cruel  ] , Inhuman , or Degrading Treatment or Punishment . 
This includes [ORG Article  ] 4 , which prohibits torture , and [ORG Article  ] 3 , which prohibits transfers of persons to countries where there is substantial likelihood that they will be tortured . 
[ORG Article  ] 3 is applied on a case-by-case basis . 
A country 's poor record on human rights will raise a red flag , but not necessarily entail a prohibition against transferring a detainee to that country . 
Instead , in each individual case the [LOC U.S.  ] seeks assurances that the person involved will not be tortured , and a transfer is only allowed if those assurances are deemed credible . 
Regarding [ORG Article  ] 16 of the [MISC Convention Against Torture  ] , which prohibits cruel , inhuman , and degrading treatment , the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Senate  ] expressed reservations during ratification in 1995 because there was no definition of " cruel , inhuman , and degrading treatment " in the [ORG Convention  ] . 
The [ORG Senate  ] 's reservation dictated that the [LOC U.S.  ] would tie this provision to the prohibitions of cruel and unusual treatment in the Fifth , Eighth and [ORG Fourteenth Amendments  ] to the [LOC U.S.  ] Constitution . 
Because these constitutional amendments apply only to [LOC U.S.  ] citizens in territories under [LOC U.S.  ] jurisdiction , the [ORG Department of Justice  ] interpreted the [ORG Senate  ] reservation to mean that [ORG Article  ] 16 applies only inside the [LOC United States  ] . 
Nonetheless , as Secretary [PER Rice  ] said in December , as a matter of policy the [LOC U.S  ] will treat detainees in a manner consistent with these standards. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Bellinger  ] described recent [LOC U.S.  ] legislation further codifying the standards applied towards detainees . 
The [ORG Detainee Treatment Act  ] of 2005 , he explained , allows the [ORG Armed Forces  ] to use interrogation techniques listed in the [LOC U.S.  ] Army [ORG Field Manual  ] . 
In addition , the [ORG McCain Amendment  ] codifies the prohibition of cruel , unusual and inhuman treatment , as interpreted by the [ORG Senate  ] in its reservation concerning [ORG Article  ] 16 of the [MISC Convention Against Torture  ] , of any detainee regardless of nationality or of where he is being held . 
Also , the [ORG Graham-Levin Amendment  ] allows detainees to appeal the results of military commissions or [ORG Combatant Status Review Tribunals  ] ( see para 12 ) to federal courts , while limiting detainees' ability to file frivolous habeas corpus suits in [LOC U.S.  ] courts . 
[PER Bellinger  ] also explained the President 's signing statement , issued with his signature of the [ORG McCain Amendment  ] . 
[PER Bellinger  ] said the statement is in keeping with customary presidential practice and does not indicate any intention to ignore the law . 
Rather , the statement explains how the President intends to interpret the law consistent with the powers conferred upon him by the Constitution . 
[PER Bellinger  ] pointed further to the public statement released by the [LOC White House  ] at the same time , which demonstrates the President 's commitment to upholding the [ORG McCain Amendment.  ] -------------------------------- [ORG REGULAR REVIEW  ] OF DETAINEE CASES -------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Bellinger  ] then raised some of the more troubling questions . 
For example , according to the rules of international armed conflict , a nation may hold detainees until the end of the conflict , when they no longer pose a threat . 
How long , however , will the war against [ORG Al Qaeda  ] last ? 
Can detainees be held indefinitely ? 
What if some are innocent ? 
The [LOC U.S.  ] recognizes that these are troubling questions , but does not believe such questions could justify a decision not to detain people who represent a danger to [MISC American  ] citizens . 
To deal with this problem at [LOC Guantanamo  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] has created an annual [ORG Administrative Review Board  ] process to determine , for each individual detainee , whether that detainee should still be considered as in a state of war with the [LOC U.S.  ] This process has resulted in the release of 180 detainees and the transfer to other countries of 76 , leaving approximately 500 detainees left in [LOC Guantanamo  ] . 
Of those released , at least a dozen people are known to have gone back to fighting against the [LOC United States.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The question has also been raised as to the possible innocence of [LOC Guantanamo  ] detainees . 
As the [ORG Geneva Conventions  ] dictate , if there is any doubt about whether or not an individual is a POW , there must be an [ORG Article  ] 5 tribunal . 
Since [ORG Taliban  ] and [ORG Al Qaeda  ] fighters clearly did not meet the conditions necessary to be granted POW status , the President decided that [ORG Article  ] 5 tribunals were not necessary . 
In 2004 , however , [ORG Combatant Status Review Tribunals  ] ( CSRTs ) were mandated by the [ORG Supreme Court  ] . 
The CSRT process goes beyond the brief tribunals required by [ORG Article  ] 5 , providing each individual detainee with a full review . 
These CSRTs have resulted in the determination that there was not enough information upon which to hold a further 38 detainees. ---------- RENDITIONS ---------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Bellinger  ] pointed out that renditions have been used for decades to detain terrorists and criminals who cannot be extradited or otherwise detained or brought to justice . 
He stressed that the [LOC United States  ] does not conduct " extraordinary " renditions for the purpose of torturing suspects or transferring them to countries in which they will be tortured . 
There are many circumstances in which a rendition might be the best option . 
In all cases , renditions are conducted in a manner consistent with international obligations and the sovereignty of other states . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] would expect that states cooperating in rendition activities would also do so in a manner consistent with their domestic law. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Bellinger  ] sought to dispel allegations that hundreds of people had been kidnapped from [MISC European  ] streets . 
He pointed out that there is no evidence for such allegations , and that the [LOC United States  ] respects the sovereignty of [MISC European  ] governments . 
On renditions , [ORG CIA  ] flights , and other intelligence operations , the [LOC U.S.  ] will not confirm or deny specific allegations , in order not to compromise the confidentiality of intelligence operations as such . 
[PER Bellinger  ] noted that denying five out of six such allegations would in effect confirm the sixth . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] trusts that [MISC European  ] governments will continue to follow the same policy. ---------------------------------------- [ORG GUANTANAMO  ] AT [MISC UN  ] [ORG HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION  ] ---------------------------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Some [ORG EU  ] interlocutors expressed concern that some [ORG EU  ] member states would support a [MISC Cuban  ] resolution against [LOC U.S.  ] actions in [LOC Guantanamo  ] at the upcoming [ORG UN Human Rights Commission  ] , that might be modeled after a [MISC European  ] Parliament resolution on the subject . 
[PER Bellinger  ] warned that [MISC European  ] support for a [ORG Guanatanamo  ] resolution would be a serious setback to [MISC U.S.-EU  ] cooperation against terrorism , and give the unacceptable impression that the [ORG EU  ] was aligned with [LOC Cuba  ] against the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG EU Council Director-General for Common Foreign and Security Policy  ] , [PER Robert Cooper  ] , said some [ORG EU  ] member states might feel obliged to support the resolution because they had agreed last year not to in return for [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to allow the [ORG UN Special Rapporteur  ] on [MISC Torture  ] , [PER Manfred Novak  ] , to visit [LOC Guantanamo  ] ; now , the [LOC U.S.  ] had gone back on that agreement . 
[PER Bellinger  ] explained that the [LOC U.S.  ] had invited [PER Novak  ] to visit , but that [PER Novak  ] had chosen publicly to reject the [LOC U.S.  ] offer ( to visit under normal conditions , but not to able to interview individual detainees , as only the [ORG ICRC  ] may do that ) . 
[PER Cooper  ] said the [ORG EU  ] , having cooperated with the [LOC U.S.  ] in resisting [MISC Chinese  ] attempts to impose conditions on visits of Special Rapporteurs , was having difficulty justifying the [LOC U.S.  ] attempts to impose conditions on [PER Novak  ] 's [LOC Guantanamo  ] visit . 
Both sides agreed that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG EU  ] needed to consult further in order to avoid a train wreck at the [ORG Human Rights Commission  ] on this. ------------------------------------ [MISC EUROPEAN  ] REACTIONS POSITIVE FOR [LOC U.S.  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) COMMENT: By and large , [PER Bellinger  ] 's [MISC European  ] interlocutors responded very positively to his visit . 
Their questions were many and varied , and all of the meetings were marked by vigorous but constructive discussion . 
It is clear that many [MISC Europeans  ] continue to believe that [ORG Article  ] 3 of the [ORG Geneva Conventions  ] can be applied to enemy combatants , and still afford the [LOC United States  ] the flexibility it seeks . 
It is also apparent that lingering concerns ( fed by negative public perceptions ) remain about the treatment of detainees , and protection against wrongful detentions . 
Some governments remain focused on renditions , and the possibility that there will be negative revelations that impact on them directly. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
That said , the visit was very helpful in beginning to dispel [MISC European  ] misunderstandings and misgivings about our pursuit of the war on terror . 
Continued engagement on these issues is critical in the coming months to persuade [ORG EU  ] governments to stand more firmly and publicly in the face of their public 's concerns and suspicion regarding [LOC Guantanamo  ] , renditions , and the legality of [LOC U.S.  ] actions against [ORG Al Qaeda  ] . 
The [MISC Austrian  ] Chair of the [ORG COJUR  ] meeting , [PER Ferdinand Trauttmansdorf  ] , concluded the meeting with the following message: " We leave this discussion with the notion that [LOC America  ] is carefully considering these difficult questions in good faith . 
" He said also that the fight against terror was a burden shared by the [ORG EU  ] , and that the [LOC U.S.  ] has as much of a right to ask questions of the [ORG EU  ] , as the [ORG EU  ] does of the [LOC U.S.  ] On the upcoming [ORG Human Rights Commission  ] , urgent consultations with the [ORG EU  ] will be necessary to avert the possibility of [ORG EU  ] support for a [MISC Cuban  ] [LOC Guantanamo  ] resolution. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( U ) This message has been cleared by Legal Adviser [PER John Bellinger  ] .
