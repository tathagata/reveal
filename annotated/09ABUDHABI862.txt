E.O. 12958: [LOC DECL:  ] 11/02/2018 TAGS: <a href='/tag/PREL_0.html'>PREL</a> <a href='/tag/AE_0.html'>AE</a> SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR THE PRESIDENT'S MEETING WITH SHAYKH MOHAMMED BIN ZAYED Classified by Ambassador [PER Richard Olson  ] , reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Mr President: [PER Shaykh Mohammed  ] bin [PER Zayed  ] is looking forward to renewing your acquaintanceship , established during his 2006 call on you. --------------------------------------------- ---- MbZ - The Man --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Shaykh Mohammed  ] bin [PER Zayed Al-Nahyan  ] , or MbZ in USG speak , is the man who runs the [LOC United Arab Emirates  ] . 
Officially he is the Crown Prince of the [LOC Emirate  ] of [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] ( the most important principality of the seven emirate confederation ) and his only federal title is Deputy Supreme Commander of the [ORG Armed Forces  ] ; in fact he is the key decision maker on national security issues . 
He will make deferential noises about his " boss " ( elder half-brother President [PER Khalifa  ] , a distant and uncharismatic personage ) , but we assess that he has authority in all matters except for final decisions on oil policy and major state expenditures. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Aged 47 , [PER MbZ  ] is a leader not just in the [LOC UAE  ] , but more broadly in the [LOC Middle East  ] , where he is seen as a particularly dynamic member of the generation succeeding the geriatric cases who have dominated the region for decades . 
He is a reformer , actively seeking to improve the life of his citizens and the [LOC UAE  ] 's future through better education and health care , and through economic diversification , including investments in clean energy to prepare his citizenry for a post-hydrocarbon future . 
He is proud of the fact that despite having had the option of life of privilege , he rose through the ranks of the [ORG UAE Armed Forces  ] , earning his wings as a helicopter pilot and retains a common touch that appeals to [LOC Emiratis.  ] --------------------------------------------- ---- [PER MbZ  ] and the Bilateral Relationship --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER MbZ  ] has staked his reputation , and his country 's future , on its relationship with the [LOC United States  ] , especially since 1990 , when the [LOC UAE  ] leadership saw that the [LOC United States  ] was prepared to shed blood in the interests of preserving international order and stability in the [LOC Gulf  ] . 
Since that formative experience , [PER MbZ  ] has built armed forces ( especially his [ORG Air Force  ] ) that are closely aligned with the [LOC US  ] . 
He is also a proponent of close economic , commercial , and where possible political ties with the [LOC US  ] . 
He has generally tried to support us where he thinks we have been right ( [LOC Afghanistan  ] ) , but also where he thinks we have pursued misguided policies ( [LOC Iraq  ] ) . 
[PER MbZ  ] recognizes that partnership with the [LOC US  ] is fundamental to the [LOC UAE  ] 's continued success , but he also knows that the relationship is controversial among his people , and that if the [LOC US  ] is perceived as an unreliable protector , his own power base will erode. --------------------------------------------- ---- [LOC Iran  ] --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER MbZ  ] sees [LOC Iran  ] as the primary external threat to the [LOC UAE  ] and his regime . 
To his eyes , [LOC Tehran  ] 's threatening rhetoric , dominance by proxy , and pursuit of nuclear weapons is reminiscent of [PER Saddam  ] in <a id='par1990' href='#par1990'>¶</a>1990 . 
Moreover , the confrontations with [LOC Iran  ] during the late 1980s tanker wars , long forgotten in the [LOC West  ] , are vividly remembered here . 
[PER MbZ  ] is probably the most passionately anti-Iran of the [MISC Arab  ] leaders , and the [LOC UAE  ] 's position is solidly with [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC Jordan  ] in seeing the principal threat to the region as coming from [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER MbZ  ] is particularly concerned at the divisions among the [MISC Gulf Arabs  ] , and sees [LOC Qatar  ] 's and [LOC Oman  ] 's decision to accommodate , rather than challenge , [MISC Iranian  ] power as troubling. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) While [PER MbZ  ] is a hard liner on [LOC Iran  ] , there are accommodationists within his own system , especially in [LOC Dubai  ] , where the [MISC Ruler  ] , [PER Mohammed  ] bin [PER Rashid Al-Maktoum  ] ( Prime Minister of the [LOC UAE  ] ) takes a position that is much closer to [LOC Qatar  ] 's . 
For this reason , and because of the basic disparity in size and power between the [LOC UAE  ] and [LOC Iran  ] , the [MISC Emiratis  ] prefer to be seen as quietly supporting a hard-line [LOC US  ] position , rather than staking out their own views . 
[PER MbZ  ] is skeptical that [LOC US  ] engagement with [LOC Iran  ] will be successful in reversing [MISC Iranian  ] positions on nuclear program , and believes that a policy of engagement puts him in an awkward position , both domestically and internationally . 
He will welcome thinking on next steps on sanctions. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Regarding the nuclear issue , [PER MbZ  ] believes that the logic of war now dominates the region . 
He regularly expresses his belief that [LOC Israel  ] will launch a pre-emptive strike against [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear facilities , most likely within next six months . 
This reflects his own assessment of the [ORG Netanyahu Government  ] , but also , probably , what [MISC Israelis  ] are telling [LOC UAE  ] in their private exchanges . 
For this reason , one of [PER MbZ  ] 's highest priorities is to finalize his integrated air defense system ( including [ORG THAAD  ] and [ORG Patriots  ] ) and advance bilateral contingency planning with the [LOC US  ] . 
Because of [MISC Qatari  ] and [MISC Omani  ] wobbliness , he is uncomfortable with multilateral ( [ORG GCC  ] ) military solutions . 
[PER MbZ  ] may float the idea of extending the [LOC US  ] nuclear umbrella to the [LOC Gulf  ] as a way of shoring up an anti-Iran coalition , and preventing a regional arms race. --------------------------------------------- ---- [LOC Israel  ] and the [MISC Arabs  ] --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER MbZ  ] 's pre-occupation with [LOC Iran  ] ( and his secondary concern about [MISC Islamic  ] fundamentalism ) lead him to have a strategic view of the region that is curiously close to the [MISC Israeli  ] one . 
But domestic politics flow the other way , and he feels constrained in what he can say publicly . 
Also , for reasons that are not entirely clear , the [LOC UAE  ] still feels a need to hide behind [ORG Arab League  ] and [ORG GCC  ] consensus , and in particular behind [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] ( even when , as is now the case , bilateral relations with the Kingdom are rocky ) . <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) We should press [PER MbZ  ] to expend political capital in resolving the century old [MISC Arab-Israeli  ] conflict . 
The issue cries out for leadership in the [MISC Arab  ] world , not least so that the common interests of moderate [MISC Arabs  ] and [MISC Israelis  ] in containing [LOC Iran  ] can find a political expression . 
So far , [PER MbZ  ] has not been prepared to run real risks in this area , but we should press him to . 
He appreciates the bold steps you have taken , and expects to be asked for help in this area. --------------------------------------------- ---- Afghanistan-Pakistan --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The discussion on [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] should be an easy one . 
The [LOC UAE  ] has played a useful role since 2001 , having deployed [ORG Special Forces  ] there since 2003 , and recently sending a [ORG Battalion  ] sized task force during the elections . 
[PER MbZ  ] tried to organize a pan-Arab force , but could not overcome the resistance of [MISC Moroccans  ] and [MISC Tunisians  ] to send troops . 
In [LOC Pakistan  ] , the [LOC UAE  ] has been supportive of [PER Zardari  ] and played a very useful role both as donor and politically as one of the key members of the friends of [LOC Pakistan  ] grouping . 
[PER MbZ  ] agrees on the need to curtail [MISC Taliban  ] financing , but is frustrated by our seeming inability to generate actionable intelligence. --------------------------------------------- ---- [ORG CT/CP Cooperation  ] --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The [LOC UAE  ] has emerged as one of our principal partners in [ORG CT Cooperation  ] through intelligence channels , having rounded up a number of cells over the past few years , and is moving toward cooperation externally as well . 
In the counterproliferation area , the [LOC UAE  ] has interdicted 20 shipments over the past two years , including within the past few days , seizing [MISC North Korean  ] systems bound for [LOC Iran  ] . 
Domestic Export Controls have lagged somewhat , but the [ORG UAEG  ] 's bureaucratic structure for implementing its export control laws is finally emerging. --------------------------------------------- ---- Conclusion --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER MbZ  ] views himself as one our closest partners in the [LOC Middle East  ] , and is keen to build on what has been an important aspect of his life 's work , a good relationship with the [LOC US  ] . 
From my perspective , our relationship with the [LOC UAE  ] is one the most promising and productive in the region .
