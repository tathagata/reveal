( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: This cable responds to Ref A request for evaluations of third-country reactions to possible [LOC U.S.  ] engagement with [LOC Iran  ] . 
[LOC Jordan  ] 's leaders believe such engagement would reward regional hardliners while undermining [MISC Arab  ] moderates - without convincing [LOC Iran  ] to cease its support for terrorism , end its nuclear program or drop its hegemonic aspirations . 
[MISC Jordanian  ] officials argue that the best way to counter [LOC Iran  ] 's ambitions is to weaken the salience of its radicalism on the [MISC Arab  ] street by fulfilling the promise of a " two-state solution , " resolving other [MISC Arab-Israeli  ] disputes , and making sure that [LOC Iraq  ] 's political and security institutions are not overwhelmed by [MISC Iranian  ] influence when the [LOC U.S.  ] drawdown is complete . 
If [MISC U.S.-Iran  ] engagement does proceed in earnest , [LOC Jordan  ] hopes to be closely consulted in advance and for its interests to be taken into account . 
End Summary . 
Beware the [MISC Iranian  ] Tentacles ... and Cut [MISC Them Off  ] --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The metaphor most commonly deployed by [MISC Jordanian  ] officials when discussing [LOC Iran  ] is of an octopus whose tentacles reach out insidiously to manipulate , foment , and undermine the best laid plans of the [LOC West  ] and regional moderates . 
[LOC Iran  ] 's tentacles include its allies [LOC Qatar  ] and [LOC Syria  ] , [ORG Hizballah  ] in [LOC Lebanon  ] , [ORG Hamas  ] in the [MISC Palestinian  ] territories , an [MISC Iraqi  ] government sometimes seen as supplicant to [LOC Tehran  ] , and [ORG Shia  ] communities throughout the region . 
While [MISC Jordanian  ] officials doubt dialogue with the [LOC U.S.  ] will convince [LOC Iran  ] to withdraw its " tentacles , " they believe they can be severed if [LOC Iran  ] is deprived of hot-button issues that make it a hero to many on the [MISC Arab  ] street , such as its championing of the [MISC Palestinian  ] cause. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) According to the [ORG GOJ  ] analysis , [LOC Iran  ] 's influence derives from the perception that [LOC Tehran  ] is able to " deliver " while moderates are not . 
The main failure of moderates as cited by radicals is ongoing [MISC Palestinian  ] suffering and dispossession despite an international consensus favoring a viable , independent [MISC Palestinian  ] state living peacefully next to [LOC Israel  ] . 
The [ORG MFA  ] 's Deputy Director of the [MISC Arab  ] and [LOC Middle East Affairs Department  ] , [PER Muwaffaq Ajlouni  ] , put it this way: " [LOC Iran  ] is not welcomed in the [MISC Arab  ] world , but it is taking advantage of helpless people . 
" From [LOC Jordan  ] 's perspective , the [LOC U.S.  ] would benefit from pressing [LOC Israel  ] to proceed to final status negotiations , which would garner [MISC Arab  ] support to deal with shared security concerns about [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In [LOC Lebanon  ] , the [ORG GOJ  ] fears [LOC Iran  ] 's [ORG Hizballah  ] proxy has been given too much rope and could be poised to increase its political influence during upcoming parliamentary elections . 
The King sees the [ORG Lebanon-Israel War  ] of 2006 as having benefited [LOC Iran  ] and [ORG Hizballah  ] , by allowing a [PER Sunni Arab  ] street enamored of " resistance " to see past its suspicions of the [ORG Shia  ] . 
And then-Foreign Minister [PER Salah Al-Bashir  ] in late 2008 described the spring 2009 vote as " when we will know who won last May , " referring to the outcome of the [LOC Doha  ] Accords that put an end to [MISC Lebanese  ] infighting . 
Much like with the [MISC Palestinian  ] issue , [MISC Jordanian  ] leaders have argued that the only way to pull the rug out from under [ORG Hizballah  ] - and by extension their [MISC Iranian  ] patrons - would be for [LOC Israel  ] to hand over the disputed [ORG Sheba'a Farms  ] to [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
With [ORG Hizballah  ] lacking the " resistance to occupation " rationale for continued confrontation with [LOC Israel  ] , it would lose its raison d'etre and probably domestic support. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In [LOC Iraq  ] , signs of growing security and political stability over the past year in particular have served somewhat to calm [MISC Jordanian  ] nerves about [LOC Iran  ] 's interference . 
The King and others have cited indications that [MISC Iraqi  ] Prime Minister [PER Nuri Al-Maliki  ] is showing himself to be a national rather than a parochial or [MISC Iranian-controlled  ] leader . 
During the [ORG U.S.-Jordan Political Dialogue  ] in November 2008 , FM Bashir noted that the [MISC Iraqi  ] government had a " tendency to appease [LOC Iran  ] , " but he saw increased [MISC Jordanian  ] ( and [PER Sunni Arab  ] ) diplomatic engagement with [LOC Baghdad  ] as a potential bulwark against [LOC Iran  ] ( Ref B ) . 
Positive trends notwithstanding , many of our [MISC Jordanian  ] interlocutors stress that the [LOC U.S.  ] should leave [LOC Iraq  ] only when it " makes sense , " and thereby avoid a political and security vacuum that could be easily filled by [LOC Iran  ] ( Ref C ) . 
Prepare for [LOC Iran  ] to Disappoint ------------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [LOC Jordan  ] 's leaders are careful not to be seen as dictating toward the [LOC U.S.  ] , but their comments betray a powerful undercurrent of doubt that the [LOC United States  ] knows how to deal effectively with [LOC Iran  ] . 
Foreign Minister [PER Nasser Joudeh  ] has suggested the [MISC Iranians  ] would be happy to let talks with the [LOC U.S.  ] continue for ten years without moving them forward , believing that they can benefit from perceived acceptance after years of isolation without paying a price. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG Upper House  ] President [PER Zeid Rifai  ] has predicted that dialogue with [LOC Iran  ] will lead nowhere , arguing that if the [LOC U.S.  ] , the [ORG EU  ] , and the [MISC Arab  ] states agree that under no circumstances should [LOC Iran  ] be allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon , military force becomes the only option . 
" Bomb [LOC Iran  ] , or live with an [MISC Iranian  ] bomb . 
Sanctions , carrots , incentives won't matter , " was how he put it to visiting [ORG NEA  ] DAS [PER David Hale  ] in November . 
While [PER Rifai  ] judged a military strike would have " catastrophic impact on the region , " he nonetheless thought preventing [LOC Iran  ] from acquiring nuclear weapons would pay enough dividends to make it worth the risks ( Ref D ) . <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Speaking to [MISC PolOffs  ] in early February 2009 , Director of the Prime Minister 's [ORG Political Office  ] Khaled [MISC Al-Qadi  ] noted that the [LOC Gaza  ] crisis had allowed [MISC Iranian  ] interference in inter-Arab relations to reach unprecedented levels . 
He urged the [LOC U.S.  ] to " understand the history , " explaining that " after the [MISC Israelis  ] , the [MISC Iranians  ] are the smartest . 
They know where they are going and what they are doing . 
" He doubted there would be any diplomatic breakthrough before [LOC Iran  ] 's June elections , partly because [MISC Iranian  ] pragmatists cannot be practical due to religious and ideological considerations . 
He hoped any dialogue would be aimed at weakening hardliners , many of whom believe their " [MISC Great Satan  ] " rhetoric . 
Talk If You Must , But [MISC Don't Sell Us Out  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) If direct [MISC U.S.-Iran  ] talks must happen , the [MISC Jordanian  ] leadership insists it not be at the expense of [MISC Arab  ] interests , particularly those of moderates like [LOC Jordan  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , and the [ORG Fatah-led Palestinian Authority  ] . 
Furthermore , they worry that engagement will set off a stampede of [MISC Arab  ] states looking to get ahead of the curve and reach their own separate peace with [LOC Tehran  ] . 
King [PER Abdullah  ] counseled Special Envoy [PER George Mitchell  ] in February that direct [LOC U.S.  ] engagement with [LOC Iran  ] at this time would just deepen intra-Arab schisms and that more " countries without a backbone " would defect to the [MISC Iranian  ] camp . 
The Prime Ministry 's [MISC Qadi  ] has assessed that [LOC Iran  ] sought to " transform the [MISC Israeli-Arab  ] conflict into an [MISC Islamic-Israeli  ] conflict " and that this strategy was already working with [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Qatar  ] . 
Even more conspiratorially , then-FM Bashir in September 2008 highlighed [MISC Arab  ] fears to a visiting [MISC CODEL  ] that the [LOC United States  ] and the [MISC West  ] would allow [LOC Iran  ] to play a hegemonic role in [LOC Iraq  ] and throughout the region in exchange for giving up its nuclear program ( Ref E ) . <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Asked late last year whether he advocated engaging [LOC Iran  ] or working against its interests without engagement , the King told visiting [LOC U.S.  ] Senators that [LOC U.S.  ] should undertake both approaches concurrently but that engagement needs to be done " smartly " by setting benchmarks for behavior ( Ref F ) . 
[ORG International Affairs  ] Director at the [ORG Royal Court Jafar Hassan  ] on April 1 operationalized [LOC Jordan  ] 's position as follows: the [LOC U.S.  ] must not only consult its friends in the region , but declare that it is doing so publicly as a signal to [LOC Iran  ] that the [MISC Arabs  ] are full parties to the [LOC U.S.  ] policy review . 
He called for the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [MISC Arabs  ] to work together to determine what deliverables are required from [LOC Iran  ] , what subjects are appropriate for discussion , and also to set clear redlines . 
( [ORG Note: Hassan  ] said [LOC Jordan  ] was trying to work with its friends in the region to develop a joint-Arab strategy , but that this has yet to materialize . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Comment: Believing the [LOC U.S.  ] is predisposed toward engagement with [LOC Iran  ] , [MISC Jordanian  ] officials have avoided forthrightly rejecting such overtures , but they remain anxious that [LOC Iran  ] will be the only one to benefit - at their expense . 
Given [MISC Jordanian  ] skepticism that [LOC Iran  ] 's regional ambitions can be reined in , they probably see establishing benchmarks as a way to keep [MISC U.S.-Iranian  ] engagement limited and short-lived . 
Re-engagement could trigger a review of [LOC Jordan  ] 's relationship with [LOC Iran  ] and with [MISC Islamic  ] groups like [ORG Hamas  ] , with which [LOC Jordan  ] held limited security talks last year . 
When asked periodically whether by engaging with [ORG Hamas  ] , [LOC Jordan  ] was undermining [ORG PA  ] President [PER Mahmoud Abbas  ] , official interlocutors simply pointed out that [LOC Israel  ] meets with [ORG Hamas  ] through [LOC Egypt  ] , that [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Iran  ] are actively engaged with [ORG Hamas  ] , and that [LOC Jordan  ] cannot be disengaged .
