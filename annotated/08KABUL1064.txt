Wood  ] for reasons 1.4 ( B ) and ( D ) Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Foreign Minister [PER Spanta  ] told the Ambassador on April 22 that he would use his meetings in [LOC Islamabad  ] the following day to underline [LOC Afghanistan  ] 's support for [LOC Pakistan  ] 's new government and explore opportunities for concrete projects ( dealing especially with trade and economic cooperation ) to strengthen cross-border ties . 
[PER Spanta  ] nevertheless expressed concern that the government must be seen as transitional and that [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] is likely to end up in power . 
[PER Spanta  ] said he is advocating close [MISC Afghan-Pak  ] cooperation on counter-terrorism as well as reconciliation efforts . 
He expressed concern over [MISC Iranian  ] meddling , including efforts to convoke Ambassador from surrounding countries to discuss [LOC U.S.  ] long-term plans in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Spanta  ] underlined his personal conviction that [LOC Iran  ] is at least as dangerous as [LOC Pakistan  ] , but defended his recent remarks downplaying evidence of [MISC Iranian  ] support for the [ORG Taliban  ] as reflecting the [MISC Afghan  ] government 's need to manage its western neighbor and avoid a second front . 
[PER Spanta  ] reiterated his intention to visit [LOC Washington  ] as soon as possible . 
[ORG Pakistan: Support for Government  ] ; Worries about the Future --------------------------------------------- ------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Spanta  ] told the Ambassador his trip to [LOC Islamabad  ] was meant to underline [MISC Afghan  ] support for and intention to cooperate with the new government . 
[PER Spanta  ] acknowledged [LOC Pakistan  ] had protested over Defense Minister [PER Wardak  ] 's recent visit to [LOC Kashmir  ] ( which [PER Wardak  ] insisted was private ) , but he did not expect that issue to have a negative impact on his meetings in [LOC Islamabad  ] . 
He planned to meet with [PER Musharraf  ] , [PER PM Gilani  ] , [PER ForMin Qureshi  ] , [ORG Lower House  ] Speaker [PER Fahmida Mirza  ] , and leaders from the [ORG ANP  ] and [ORG PPP  ] , and if possible [ORG Pakistani Muslim League  ] Leader [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] ( trip readout septel ) . 
[PER Spanta  ] would be looking for opportunities to identify concrete projects to further cross-border cooperation , particularly in the area of economic cooperation , trade , and transit arrangements . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] will be doing everything possible to help the new government succeed , as having a civilian government is critical . 
[PER Spanta  ] nevertheless expressed concern that the current arrangement can only be seen as transitional , given that the [ORG PPP  ] did not put forth its strongest person . 
In [PER Spanta  ] 's view , this had been a great mistake as it might lead to [PER Sharif  ] ( who has strong connections to [MISC Islamic  ] groups ) ending up in power . 
[PER Spanta  ] said he would be able to discuss his concerns frankly with the [ORG ANP  ] , but would need to be very diplomatic in conversations with the [LOC PPP.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Spanta  ] said that , while President [PER Karzai  ] might not take his advice , he is advocating close [MISC Afghan-Pakistan  ] cooperation on counter-insurgency efforts and on reconciliation . 
He underlined the danger of any separate accommodation with al [PER Qaeda  ] , arguing that the consequence of separate action by [LOC Pakistan  ] would be movement of the [ORG Taliban  ] across the border to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
This would be bad for [LOC Afghanistan  ] , but also dangerous for [LOC Pakistan  ] in that it would allow the terrorists and extremists to turn [LOC Afghanistan  ] into a base against [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
He said he wanted to deepen the dialogue on this an other issues and would be inviting [PER Qureshi  ] to [LOC Kabul  ] for discussions within three months . 
He added that [LOC Kabul  ] , [LOC Islamabad  ] and [LOC Ankara  ] are working on a date for the next meeting in the [MISC Istanbul-round  ] of discussions at the presidential level. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The Ambassador said the [LOC U.S.  ] supports deepened [MISC Afghan-Pakistan  ] dialogue at all levels . 
He agreed that the transitional arrangement in [LOC Pakistan  ] is less than ideal and understood concerns about [PER Sharif  ] , but added that there are signs that the ISI is pressuring those in the tribal areas to distance themselves from the [MISC Arabs  ] . 
The best solution would be a combined counter-terrorism operation against al [PER Qaeda  ] , the [LOC Pakistan  ] [ORG Taliban  ] , and the [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Taliban  ] . 
Closure of refuges used by terrorists in [LOC Pakistan  ] should be a priority . 
[LOC KABUL  ] 00001064 002 OF 002 Some terrorists would come across the border , but here they can be defeated . 
Iran: Its Meddling and its Dialogue with [MISC Afghan  ] Neighbors --------------------------------------------- ------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Spanta  ] commented on the new [MISC Iranian  ] Ambassador 's aggressive efforts to coordinate and lead the [MISC Iranian  ] campaign to influence events in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
He described Ambassador [PER Fada Hossein Maleki  ] as close to the [ORG National Front  ] as well as to [PER Karzai  ] 's Chief of [PER Staff Daudzai  ] ( who served as [MISC Afghan  ] Ambassador to [LOC Iran  ] until 2007 ) . 
[PER Spanta  ] claimed [PER Maleki  ] was meeting regularly with President [PER Karzai  ] , but was more concerned that he had organized meetings with his [MISC Russian  ] , [MISC Chinese  ] , [MISC Uzbek  ] , [PER Kazak  ] , [MISC Tajik  ] , [MISC Indian  ] and [MISC Pakistani  ] counterparts to discuss [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
According to reports [PER Spanta  ] had heard , [PER Maleki  ] had used the first meeting to articulate his view of long-term [LOC U.S.  ] plans in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Spanta  ] understood the [MISC Indian  ] Ambassador had agreed to host the next meeting of the group . 
He appealed to the Ambassador to consider convoking a larger group to include the current participants plus the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] -- an expansion of the six-plus-two concept. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The Ambassador noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] would have difficulties participating in the group with [LOC Iran  ] and noted that there are established mechanisms for broad-based dialogue that includes [LOC Iran  ] -- such as the [ORG JCMB  ] co-chaired by the [MISC Afghan  ] government and [ORG UNAMA  ] . 
He told [PER Spanta  ] he would share [PER Spanta  ] 's idea for a broad regionally based dialogue with [LOC Washington  ] for consideration before the [PER ForMin  ] 's proposed visit to [LOC Washington  ] later in the Spring . 
How to Manage [LOC Iran  ] ------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The Ambassador then raised [PER Spanta  ] 's recent statements downplaying [MISC Iranian  ] actions ( including that there is no evidence [LOC Iran  ] is assisting the [ORG Taliban  ] ) . 
He told [PER Spanta  ] that this statement had caught [LOC Washington  ] 's attention as , in fact , we all know that [LOC Iran  ] is providing support to the [ORG Taliban  ] . 
The Ambassador underlined that the [LOC U.S.  ] appreciates the problems [LOC Afghanistan  ] has with [LOC Iran  ] and the need for good relations ; the challenge is finding a way to be a good neighbor without exonerating them. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Spanta  ] defended his statements , saying they reflected the position of the [MISC Afghan  ] government and that he had been doing his duty . 
While there is indeed deep concern over [MISC Iranian  ] influence , it is simply not possible for [LOC Afghanistan  ] to open a second front with [LOC Iran  ] , given the need to deal with [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[PER Spanta  ] observed that while he personally believes that [LOC Iran  ] is more dangerous than [LOC Pakistan  ] ( I cannot accept the role of mullahs , especially the [MISC Iranian  ] mullahs ) , he recognizes that he is obligated to work to reduce tensions with [LOC Iran  ] . 
The Ambassador reiterated that being a good neighbor does not require ignoring or denying actions that are unacceptable . 
Trip to [LOC Washington  ] ------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The [PER ForMin  ] reiterated his desire to travel to [LOC Washington  ] as soon as possible to lay the groundwork for a possible visit by President [PER Karzai  ] and the [ORG Paris Conference  ] . 
He also hoped to sign a joint statement affirming [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Afghan  ] commitment to the [ORG Strategic Partnership  ] ( text of agreed statement will be forwarded to [ORG SCA/A  ] ) while he was in [LOC Washington  ] . 
He said he recognized the statement would be largely symbolic , but asserted that it would have positive resonance with the [MISC Afghan  ] public . 
[PER Spanta  ] was working through the [MISC Afghan  ] Embassy in [LOC Washington  ] and aiming for a visit early in May . 
The Ambassador promised to relay the request .
