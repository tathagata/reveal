[LOC BERLIN  ] 00214 [LOC BERLIN  ] 00001395 001.2 OF 002 Classified By: ECONMIN [PER Robert A. Pollard  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b , d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [MISC Summary: Just  ] hours after Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] 's historic November 3 address to a joint session of [ORG Congress  ] , [ORG General Motors  ] ( [ORG GM  ] ) canceled its sale of [ORG Opel  ] to [MISC Canadian  ] auto parts manufacturer [ORG Magna  ] . 
The decision , which followed repeated assurances from [ORG GM  ] that it was a done deal , came as a complete shock in [LOC Germany  ] and dominated media coverage throughout the day . 
[PER Merkel  ] herself was reportedly highly upset over [ORG GM  ] 's flip flop . 
[PER Ulrich Wilhelm  ] , the Chancellor 's spokesman on [ORG Opel  ] said the [MISC German  ] government " regretted " the decision , and reminded [ORG GM  ] that it must now repay [LOC Berlin  ] 's 1.5 billion bridge loan to [ORG Opel  ] by the end of the month , while [MISC FDP Economics Minister  ] [PER Rainer Bruederle  ] described [ORG GM  ] 's action as " totally unacceptable . 
" The cabinet was expected to discuss the [ORG GM  ] move on November 4 . 
[ORG Opel  ] 's labor unions , which had strongly backed the [ORG Magna  ] sale because of its promise to save jobs and keep plants open , announced that workers would withdraw all concessions made under the terms of the [ORG Magna  ] deal and sta rt a general strike at [ORG Opel  ] plants on November 5 . 
While anger is widespread , there are already some voices outside the government advocating acceptance of [ORG GM  ] 's announcement as the only viable alternative to a total collapse of [ORG Opel  ] . 
End Summary . 
[LOC Germany  ] 's [ORG Political Establishment Reacts with Anger  ] --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Opinion across the political spectrum has been uniformly negative . 
[MISC FDP Economics Minister  ] [PER Rainer Bruederle  ] blasted [ORG GM  ] 's behavior as " totally unacceptable . 
" [PER Juergen Ruettgers  ] , Minister President of [PER Nordrhein Westfallen  ] ( [ORG CDU  ] ) , asserted that [ORG GM  ] 's decision showed " the ugly face of turbo capitalism . 
" The leadership of the [ORG FDP  ] , whose opposition to government intervention in the [ORG Opel  ] deal is well known , joined in the condemnation of [ORG GM  ] . 
A high-level source indicated that Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] is furious over the [ORG GM  ] move and refuses to talk to [ORG GM  ] 's leadership . 
It is likely to be only a matter of time before critics will call [PER Merkel  ] herself into account for her strong support of the now collapsed [ORG Magna  ] deal . 
The [ORG Cabinet  ] has been called into session and is likely to confirm the withdrawal of all financial support and a demand that [ORG GM  ] repay the government 's 1.5 billion [MISC Euro  ] bridge loan by the end of the month. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Jochen Homann  ] , the [ORG Economic Ministry State  ] Secretary heading the [MISC German  ] interagency working group on [ORG Opel  ] , told [LOC EMIN  ] on November 4 that there was no possibility of further [MISC German  ] financial assistance to [ORG Opel  ] in the foreseeable future . 
The failure of the [ORG Magna  ] deal and [ORG GM  ] 's reputation as " an unreliable partner " would likewise complicate negotiations with other governments seeking to preserve [ORG Opel  ] jobs and factories . 
Although no one directly blamed the [ORG USG  ] , the [MISC Germans  ] are still having trouble understanding how [ORG GM  ] could act independently of [LOC Washington  ] . 
Dr. [PER Schubert  ] , one of [PER Homann  ] 's lieutenants , complained to the Embassy that " if the [LOC U.S.  ] Government had [ORG GM  ] under better control , this would not have happened . 
" It is now up to [ORG GM  ] , he said , to submit a new restructuring and financing plan , as their previous one is out of date . 
[PER Schubert  ] was adamant that this time " there will be no special treatment for [ORG Opel  ] " and [ORG GM  ] 's plan would have to go through normal channels . 
Matched by Threats from Organized Labor --------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Klaus Franz  ] , the head of [ORG Opel  ] 's [ORG Works Council  ] , announced on November 4 that [ORG Opel  ] 's 25,000 employees in [LOC Germany  ] will begin an indefinite strike on November 5 to protest the [ORG GM  ] decision . 
[PER Franz  ] called on all 55,000 [ORG Opel  ] workers across [LOC Europe  ] to join in . 
Accusing [ORG GM  ] of " blackmailing " governments and workers in [LOC Europe  ] to sign on to its " unacceptable " restructuring Plan , he also revoked prior labor commitments to contribute 388 million dollars in foregone benefits to the [ORG Magna  ] sale . 
[LOC BERLIN  ] 00001395 002.2 OF 002 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Oliver Burkhardt  ] , head of the [ORG Metal Workers  ] in [LOC NRW  ] , likewise condemned the decision as " bold and unfriendly , " not only to [ORG Opel  ] employees , but to the [MISC German  ] government . 
However , [PER Burkhardt  ] conceded that he is waiting to see a long term [ORG GM  ] plan for [ORG Opel  ] that relies on more than cost-cutting and down-sizing . 
In contrast to [PER Klaus Franz  ] , [PER Burkhardt  ] contended that non-German labor unions were " elated " over the failure of the [ORG Magna  ] deal ( which was tilted against workers in other countries ) and doubted they would heed [PER Franz  ] 's strike call . 
He also predicted that the strikes in [LOC Germany  ] will be short-term and largely symbolic rather than actual closures , adding " we are not going to close the door on a solution with [ORG GM  ] . 
" Similarly , [PER Fred Irwin  ] - [ORG Citigroup  ] 's country manager in [LOC Germany  ] and the Chair of the [ORG Opel Trust  ] that oversaw the [ORG Magna  ] negotiations - predicted that unions will eventually reconcile with [ORG GM  ] once they realize there is no other choice . 
While Despair Permeates [ORG Opel Executives  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG Opel  ] managers such as [LOC Berlin  ] Representative [PER Uwe Berlinghoff  ] , who almost uniformly favored the [ORG Magna  ] contract , were also " taken completely by surprise " by the [ORG GM  ] announcement . 
[PER Berlinghoff  ] now expects [ORG GM  ] to resurrect its pre-Magna restructuring plans , including closure of plants at [LOC Bochum  ] ( and [LOC Antwerp  ] , [LOC Belgium  ] ) and the sale or closure of the [LOC Eisenach  ] plant . 
[PER Berlinghoff  ] also expected the [MISC German  ] government to cancel the expected 4.5 billion dollar loan guarantee package , as " [ORG GM  ] has demonstrated its lack of credibility with [MISC German  ] politicians . 
" [ORG Research  ] and [ORG Development  ] and [ORG IPR  ] Could be Key --------------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [MISC German  ] auto industry insiders have privately identified compelling reasons why [ORG GM  ] cancelled the [ORG Magna  ] deal . 
Among these are the importance of the [ORG GM/Opel Research and Development  ] facility in [LOC Ruesselsheim  ] and its patents to [ORG GM  ] 's development of small efficient cars in [LOC Europe  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] and elsewhere . 
[ORG GM  ] was also reportedly skeptical that it could adequately protect crucial [ORG IPR  ] from [MISC Russian  ] exploitation because of the [MISC Sberbank/Gaz  ] partnership with [ORG Magna  ] . 
Moreover , [ORG Magna  ] had oversold its ability to penetrate the [MISC Russian  ] market . 
[ORG GM  ] 's announcement stressed its plans to build on its already significant business in [LOC Russia  ] while retaining [ORG Opel  ] and to work closely with Gaz without a [ORG Magna  ] partnership . 
But Auto Leader Welcomes the Move --------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Dr. [PER Norbert Reithofer  ] , the CEO of [ORG BMW  ] , told the Ambassador on November 4 that [ORG GM  ] 's move would be welcomed by the [MISC German  ] auto industry . 
[PER Reithofer  ] was adamant that there was no way [ORG BMW  ] and the other [MISC German  ] auto manufacturers would have purchased auto parts from [ORG Magna  ] once it became a direct competitor as an auto manufacturer . 
In [PER Reithofer  ] 's view , [ORG Magna  ] made the [ORG Opel  ] purchase proposal in a moment of panic at the height of the economic crisis , but now that a recovery is in the offing , probably is not unhappy to see it dissolve . 
Comment ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Despite the considerable [MISC German  ] ire aimed at [ORG GM  ] , much of it is aimed at [ORG GM  ] 's handling of [ORG Opel  ] ( in particular the timing of the November 3 announcement ) , rather than its business rationale for retaining its [MISC German  ] subsidiary . 
Thoughtful [MISC German  ] opinion leaders , including former Economics Minister zu [PER Guttenberg  ] conservatives in the [MISC German  ] business community , were equally critical of [LOC Berlin  ] 's strong arm lobbying on behalf of [ORG Magna  ] . 
An [ORG Opel Trust Board Member  ] and [ORG FDP  ] politician [PER Dirk Pfeil  ] has already issued a statement urging [LOC Berlin  ] to provide 3 billion [MISC Euro  ] in state aid to keep [ORG GM  ] afloat . 
Like it or not , the [MISC German  ] governments will need to seek an accommodation with [ORG GM  ] to keep [ORG Opel  ] alive .
