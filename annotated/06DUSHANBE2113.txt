REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: On September 21 [ORG Embassy Dushanbe  ] , together with our [MISC Russian  ] diplomatic and military colleagues , commemorated the 1992 evacuation of [MISC American  ] diplomats from [ORG Dushanbe  ] at the start of the [MISC Tajik  ] civil war . 
The [MISC Russian  ] 201st [ORG Motorized Rifle Division  ] resident in [LOC Dushanbe  ] was instrumental in assisting the evacuation , and as usual our commemoration included a wreath-laying ceremony at the 201st headquarters . 
The Ambassador also hosted a dinner for ranking [MISC Russian  ] diplomats and military commanders . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] initiated these events , as we have in the past , in order to emphasize to our [MISC Russian  ] counterparts the value of cooperation on issues of mutual concern . 
The morning event at the 201st was collegial and even festive , replete with heartfelt vodka toasts . 
The [MISC Russians  ] used the [MISC American  ] hosted dinner however as an opportunity to send a clear message that cooperation will not extend beyond a shared shot of vodka ( or two , or a dozen ) . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In October 1992 , the [ORG Department ordered  ] the evacuation of the newly established embassy in [LOC Dushanbe  ] due to the worsening security situation caused by the civil war . 
The [MISC Russian  ] 201st [ORG Motorized Rifle Division  ] - now the 201st [ORG Military Base  ] - assisted the [ORG Embassy  ] with the evacuation . 
Several years ago , the [ORG Embassy  ] began commemorating the anniversary by thanking the [MISC Russian  ] 201st command , laying a wreath at the 201st headquarters and hosting a dinner for senior [MISC Russian  ] officials in country . 
For this year’s event , we worked for nearly a month to find a date which worked for the [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador , Defense Attache and 201st Commander . 
We accommodated the [MISC Russian  ] calendars by postponing the event until November 21. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The wreath-laying ceremony proceeded according to script . 
Even the weather cooperated , with the first snowfall of the season to mark the somber occasion . 
The wintry conditions also contributed to the [MISC Russians’  ] already marked enthusiasm to turn the morning ceremony into an occasion for vodka drinking . 
Participating Embassy staff lost track of the exact count , but the many heartfelt toasts offered by both [MISC Americans  ] and [MISC Russians  ] were offered in a genuine spirit of cooperation. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) At the dinner later that evening , the [MISC Russians  ] sent us a very different message . 
Three days prior , at President Rahmonov’s inauguration , [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador [PER Ramazan Abdulatipov  ] informed the Ambassador that he would not be able to attend her dinner on the 21st . 
He explained he had been called to [LOC Moscow  ] for business , but his [ORG DCM  ] would plan to attend . 
At the morning wreath-laying ceremony , [MISC Russian  ] [ORG DCM  ] [PER Vyacheslav Svetlichny  ] informed the Ambassador that he also had a scheduling conflict . 
He did not offer to send any other diplomats in his place , and no [MISC Russian  ] civilians attended . 
At the dinner , [MISC Russian  ] Defense Attache Colonel [PER Yuri Ivanov  ] took two calls on his mobile phone and excused himself after the first course , promising to return after 10 minutes . 
He did not return . 
Of the 201st command staff , only two of the four invited officers showed up , including 201st Commander Colonel [PER Alexei Zavizyan  ] . 
Zavizyan’s behavior was mildly rude throughout the evening but deteriorated rapidly after Colonel Ivanov’s departure . 
[PER Zavizyan  ] chastised the [MISC Ambassador’s  ] household staff and made a series of sexist remarks . 
The dinner ended abruptly after he sunk to uttering ugly racist slurs about [MISC African Americans.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [MISC Comment:  ] The [MISC Russians  ] poor attendance at the dinner was no accident . 
We worked closely with the [MISC Russian  ] Embassy for more than a month to pin down dates and an invitation list for their participation . 
It is also clear that Zavizyan’s [ORG DUSHANBE  ] 00002113 002 OF 002 incredibly rude behavior was no accident , nor would we attribute it to vodka consumption . 
Our [MISC Russian  ] guests made it very clear that while they will share the occasional toast with us , they do not consider us friends here in [LOC Tajikistan  ] and will make it difficult to cooperate on issues of mutual concern . 
While we have faced intransigence from the [MISC Russian  ] military and security elements here in the past , typically the [MISC Russian  ] diplomats step in to smooth the edges . 
On this occasion , the [MISC Russian  ] embassy did little to facilitate the events and absented themselves to avoid complicity with their military colleagues at the dinner . 
We plan to continue to take the high road , proposing areas for cooperation where it’s in our mutual interest . 
But we won’t be inviting the [MISC Russian  ] military to dinner any time soon .
