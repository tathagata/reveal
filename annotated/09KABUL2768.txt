<code><pre>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 [LOC KABUL  ] 002768 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 09/10/2019 TAGS PGOV , PREL , AF SUBJECT: [PER ABDULLAH  ] THOUGHTFUL ABOUT HIS NEXT MOVE REF: [LOC KABUL  ] 2767 Classified By: D/Ambassador [PER Francis Ricciardone  ] , Reason 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In a meeting September 9 , presidential challenger Dr. [PER Abdullah Abdullah  ] told Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] that he had not anticipated the elections process taking so long . 
While he wanted to let the process play out completely he might rethink his next move in view of whether a second round would occur sufficiently soon truly to benefit the country . 
End Summary. ------------------------------- Still Under Pressure - But Calm ------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) We met [PER Abdullah  ] late at night , alone with one notetaker , after his long day which included a ceremony commemorating the eighth anniversary of the death of his mentor , [PER Massoud  ] . 
Tired but relaxed , [PER Abdullah  ] exhibited some of his usual humor -- he noted that he’d said hello to [ORG IEC  ] Chairman [PER Ludin  ] but not kissed him at the ceremony ; [PER Ludin  ] said “don’t turn your face from me” and [PER Abdullah  ] had replied “I won’t if you don’t turn YOUR face from Mecca” - a Dari expression for lying . 
The ceremony had been well-attended by former [ORG Mujahedin  ] , who are currently on either side of the presidential race ; [PER Abdullah  ] said that “only Massoud’s spirit” could have unified such a group . 
He claimed he was the only one who got standing ovations from the crowd. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Abdullah  ] complained that the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] was circulating a letter accusing him and his supporters , such as Balkh Governor [PER Atta  ] , of distributing weapons ( reftel ) . 
He called this an “irresponsible” allegation and counter-accused the government of distributing weapons to self-defense groups in [LOC Konduz  ] and [LOC Balkh  ] as part of a widespread program . 
Saying that he doesn’t want “anything to ignite anywhere” he added that in this highly emotional time , the difference between rumors and facts must be clarified . 
[PER Eikenberry  ] said that we have looked into these allegations and found no areas of concern . 
[PER Abdullah  ] added that he has recently completed his round of consultations with all his provincial supporters and has discouraged demonstrations since they could become excuses for violence. ------------------------------------ I Didn’t Think it Would Take So Long ------------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] stressed to [PER Abdullah  ] that his conduct during the campaign , and now , has made him a national figure with a real future in [MISC Afghan  ] politics . 
He reiterated the [LOC U.S.  ] position that we are committed to a credible process and noted that the most senior [LOC U.S.  ] leadership was interested in learning about Dr. Abdullah’s thoughts on a way forward . 
[PER Eikenberry  ] noted that we were now faced with an issue that complicates the process: the possibility that the partial recount that the [ORG ECC  ] has ordered could extend into the winter season ; if so , a second round , if it were ordered , could not be held until Spring 2010 . 
He noted that a failure of the elections process would have a huge impact in the [LOC United States  ] , given the many years of effort and commitment we have given to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
A successful campaign process and good day of voting , all led by the [MISC Afghans  ] for the first time , are being overshadowed by the current stalemate. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Abdullah  ] appeared subdued as he responded that he didn’t want such a long period of uncertainty ; he thought that disqualifying obvious fraud would have brought Karzai’s number below 50 percent long before now. “I can take it for longer , but what about the country ? ” he asked , noting that [PER Karzai  ] would keep making decisions anyway during the period of uncertainty , and that his own followers were in danger of harassment or worse , and some teachers who supported him had lost their jobs . 
The [ORG ECC  ] “has guts” he said - but “how long will it take ? ” A process dragging on until April could jeopardize public opinion in the [LOC United States  ] , which like all public opinion is “fickle.” [LOC U.S.  ] support , once lost , will not come back , he said . 
[PER Abdullah  ] also admitted the strong possibility of [PER Karzai  ] winning a second round. --------------------------------------------- - [PER Abdullah  ] on [ORG Karzai: Holding the Nation Hostage  ] --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Abdullah  ] indulged in a variety of criticisms of [PER Karzai  ] , saying that he was working for his own interests against those of the whole country . 
[PER Abdullah  ] said [PER Karzai  ] reportedly asked his Defense Minister “Your [ORG ANA  ] can manage without the [MISC Americans  ] , can’t it ? ” but the answer was “We get 400,000 liters of petrol a day from them ; without them , we’d end our operations in two days.” [LOC KABUL  ] 00002768 002 OF 002 <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) When Karzai’s people had approached him three months ago , [PER Abdullah  ] said , he refused to join them because “I couldn’t influence him when he had good people around him , and now he has bad people advising him.” He gave [PER Karzai  ] two messages at that time: don’t run for president , you will have a great legacy and wipe away all your mistakes if you give up power ; or if you do run , don’t try to rig the elections . 
Now , [PER Abdullah  ] said , [PER Karzai  ] will keep digging in , whatever the damage to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and “we’re all stuck” with him . 
[PER Abdullah  ] ended with the acerbic note that “the one thing that bothers me is that we shouldn’t allow one person to hold the destiny of the nation hostage.” ---------------------------------- What Next ? 
The Good of the [LOC Country  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Abdullah  ] admitted that he had been “approached” recently by [ORG Karzai’s National Security Advisor  ] about a deal to end the election standoff , but clarified that it was “not a dialogue” since he wanted to take his time and let the process run its course . 
He was also approached by the brother of Karzai’s Vice Presidential running mate ( and fellow [MISC Panjshiri  ] ) [PER Marshall Fahim  ] , who warned him that he would not have support in a second round and should make a deal now . 
[PER Abdullah  ] said that [PER Karzai  ] has talked to some of his supporters , such as former President [PER Rabbani  ] , but that he sees no way that he “himself” would take part in a [PER Karzai  ] government -- leaving open the possibility that one of his associates may do so . 
The Ambassador noted that despite rumors that the [LOC United States  ] was pushing a national unity government , we have never done so ; [PER Abdullah  ] said he believed us and appreciated our support for the process. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Looking at his future , [PER Abdullah  ] said that while he wanted to create a national and cross-ethnic movement which could become a true political party , he could not see any point in focusing on Parliamentary elections in 2010 given the [MISC IEC’s  ] corruption and double-dealing in this election . 
Some “good MP’s” told him they won’t survive the next election due to [ORG IEC  ] corruption , he said . 
The [ORG IEC  ] has had to put aside ballots in this election because the results can’t possibly be entered into their computers due to the fraud controls - but then they “play with words” and refuse to invalidate those ballots . 
Their actions are a “tragic joke” he said , adding that the problem for Karzai’s camp and the [ORG IEC  ] turned out to be that they had planned on a higher turnout which would have covered up fraud . 
[PER Abdullah  ] expressed anger at some of the most egregious examples of fraud -- noting that rural [LOC Paktika  ] province apparently had the same number of voters as [ORG Balkh  ] ( whose capital is populous [MISC Mazar-e-Sharif  ] ) . <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Being in the opposition would be a hard and vulnerable position , [PER Abdullah  ] said , but capitalizing on this new political movement was crucial because it is the only “healthy” movement with a chance to expand . 
[PER Abdullah  ] noted that he had supported a large number of [ORG Provincial Council  ] candidates during the election , after vetting them carefully first . 
He believes that many did very well in their provinces and can become a base for future political leadership ; he is maintaining a network of linkages for such a future movement . 
[PER Karzai  ] had had a ‘golden opportunity’ , [PER Abdullah  ] said , but ruined it and is only “declining.” The country is vulnerable to ethnic fascism , extremism , drug trafficking , and organized crime -- all of which interests will oppose the national movement he hopes to create , and all of which are allied with [PER Karzai  ] , he alleged. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Abdullah  ] exhorted the [LOC U.S.  ] not to give up on the process yet , saying that “expediency for immediate concerns” could undermine the rule of law and that longer term interests should not be sacrificed to shorter term ones . 
[PER Eikenberry  ] acknowledged that there were competing imperatives of the credibility of the process and pressures of time , telling [PER Abdullah  ] he should make political choices to help the situation knowing that he is at a period of maximum influence . 
[PER Abdullah  ] gave no immediate indication of his next move but agreed to remain in close contact .
