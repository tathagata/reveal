( C ) [MISC Argentine  ] Finance Secretary [PER Hernan Lorenzino  ] expects the [ORG GoA  ] 's proposed debt swap agreement to be fully approved by international regulatory authorities and ready for launch by mid-March . 
Noting the recent negative market environment , he said that the exchange might have to go forward without the new money component that was earlier thought to be a key part of the proposal - the USD 1 billion that was to be raised from institutional investors as part of the deal . 
[PER Lorenzino  ] dismissed the attempt by the political opposition to tie [ORG Barclays  ] , the lead bank working on the debt swap , to the [MISC British  ] oil rig exploring for oil off the coast of the [LOC Falkland/Malvinas Islands  ] . 
He said [ORG Barclays  ] was not associated with the rig 's owner and that its position working on the holdout proposal is secure . 
Regarding the [ORG Paris Club  ] debt , [PER Lorenzino  ] said that the [ORG GoA  ] would focus its attention on the issue after the holdout debt restructuring is completed ; separately , however , he is telling at least one [MISC European  ] Embassy that the [ORG GoA  ] is unwilling to submit to an [ORG IMF Article IV  ] consultation . 
He also discussed the imminent transfer of [ORG ARP  ] 24 billion in 2009 [ORG Central Bank  ] ( [ORG BCRA  ] ) profits to the [ORG Treasury  ] , calling it " business as usual . 
" Finally , with regard to the [ORG Azurix ICSID  ] negotiations , [PER Lorenzino  ] said that the case was moving forward and that new [ORG Treasury Attorney Da Rocha  ] would be meeting with the Chief of Cabinet or President in the next few days to discuss it . 
End Summary . 
[ORG SEC  ] Still Asking Questions ------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Secretary of Finance [PER Hernan Lorenzino  ] told EconCouns on February 22 that the [ORG GoA  ] is waiting for [ORG U.S. Security and Exchange Commission  ] ( [ORG SEC  ] ) approval to be able to move ahead with the proposed debt restructuring . 
He explained that the disruption caused by the snow storms in the [LOC U.S.  ] had somewhat delayed the [ORG SEC  ] 's review process . 
The [ORG GoA  ] expects to receive a new round of [ORG SEC  ] questions and requests for clarifications imminently . 
[PER Lorenzino  ] said that he will not be able to estimate with any confidence when the holdout transaction would be ready to launch until he sees the number and complexity of these questions . 
Following authorization by the [ORG SEC  ] , the regulatory agencies of [LOC Luxembourg  ] , [LOC Italy  ] and [LOC Japan  ] will also examine the proposal . 
He noted that [LOC Luxembourg  ] has already begun reviewing the documentation and sent several questions which the [ORG GoA  ] expected to answer within the next few days . 
The [MISC Italian  ] regulatory agency ( [ORG Consob  ] ) has also begun an informal review of the filing . 
( The [MISC Italian  ] Ambassador to [MISC Argentine  ] [PER Guido La Tella  ] told the Ambassador February 18 that he had also met recently with [PER Lorenzino  ] and was given the same upbeat presentation on the deal 's prospects . 
) Despite continuing uncertainty about the status of the [ORG SEC  ] review , [PER Lorenzino  ] expressed the hope that all of the international regulatory agencies involved would complete their review processes within the next two to three weeks , and that the [ORG GoA  ] would be able to launch the swap in mid-March . 
New Money Component May Be Dropped --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Lorenzino  ] acknowledged that while the present market environment is becoming somewhat less positive , this does not overly concern him . 
The [ORG GoA  ] 's top priority is to secure all the necessary regulatory approvals to get the transaction ready for a global launch . 
However , he did indicate , for the first time , that the more negative market environment might require the exchange to go forward as a stand-alone transaction , without a new money component . 
( Conventional wisdom up to now has been that in order to support the proposals , the Kirchners had demanded that at least USD 1 billion in new money be raised from institutional investors as an integral part of the debt swap . 
) [ORG Barclays Position  ] as [ORG Lead Bank Secure  ] --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) EconCouns asked whether the position of [ORG Barclays Bank  ] as the lead bank working for the [ORG GoA  ] in the development of the holdout proposal was endangered by opposition accusations that the bank held a significant position in the [MISC British-owned  ] company [ORG Desire Petroleum  ] , which is leading the controversial effort to explore for oil and natural gas in the waters off of the [LOC Falkland/Malvinas Islands  ] . 
[PER Lorenzino  ] responded that [ORG Barclays  ] position was secure . 
He said that the company does not own any part of [ORG Desire Petroleum  ] . 
Rather , [ORG Barclays  ] owns a fund that manages third-party funds which are invested in that company . 
He emphasized that the [ORG Barclay  ] 's business unit hired to work on the debt exchange has no connection whatsoever to anything related to the [ORG Falklands/Malvinas  ] and would continue in its present role with regard to the holdout proposal . 
[ORG Paris Club  ] After Holdouts --------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Lorenzino  ] said that while full attention is now focused on the debt exchange , the [ORG GoA  ] has the will to move forward to solve the problem of the debt owed to the [ORG Paris Club  ] creditors . 
He explained that his people have been working on a strategic plan -- which has been presented to the Minister of Economy -- to make progress on this issue after the completion of the debt restructuring . 
He added that discussions have progressed to the point where the government has met with various financial experts who may potentially advise it regarding how to proceed with the issue . 
( [MISC Italian  ] Ambassador [PER La Tella  ] told the Ambassador that [PER Lorenzino  ] described the [ORG GoA  ] 's [ORG Paris Club  ] game-plan in greater detail in a recent conversation , and that it is , to put it mildly , unorthodox . 
In lieu of an [ORG IMF Article IV  ] consultation , the [ORG GoA  ] will propose that the [ORG Paris Club  ] accept a " peer review " of [LOC Argentina  ] 's economy in the [LOC G20  ] , in which [LOC Argentina  ] is a member , or in the [ORG OECD  ] , in which it is not . 
) 2009 [ORG BCRA  ] Profits to [ORG Treasury  ] ----------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Lorenzino  ] confirmed press articles which said that about [ORG ARP  ] 24 billion in 2009 [ORG BCRA  ] profits would be transferred to the [ORG Treasury  ] . 
He said that this has been standard practice for the last couple of years . 
He compared it to a dividend payout received by stockholders in private companies , explaining that the profit on the [ORG BCRA  ] 's assets came mainly from the peso devaluation and the interest on bonds in the [ORG BCRA  ] 's portfolio . 
The transfer will take place after the [ORG BCRA  ] 's Board of Directors approves the transaction . 
[ORG Azurix ICSID Case  ] ------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Lorenzino  ] explained that the [ORG Treasury Attorney  ] 's office ( Procuracion General del [ORG Tesoro  ] ) has the lead on the [ORG Azurix ICSID  ] case negotiations and that the [ORG Ministry of Economy  ] 's role is secondary . 
He mentioned that he recently participated in two meetings related to [ORG Azurix  ] with the new [ORG Treasury Attorney Joaquin Da Rocha  ] , in one of which Economy Minister [PER Boudou  ] participated . 
In those meetings , they discussed the general budgetary impact of ICISD cases , including [ORG Azurix  ] , [ORG CMS  ] , and two similar cases which had been decided in favor of the companies involved and awards were granted . 
Regarding the [ORG Azurix  ] case specifically , they discussed how to deal with the complication of the involvement of the [ORG Province of Buenos Aires  ] in the case and how that would affect the flow of money from the [ORG Treasury  ] to the company . 
Despite that , [PER Lorenzino  ] said that he was not aware of any problems that would delay an agreement , saying that the case is moving forward , and that [ORG Da Rocha  ] will meet in the next few days with the Chief of Cabinet and/or the President on the issue . 
Comment -------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Lorenzino  ] still seems to have the full support of the government to carry the debt restructuring through to a conclusion . 
In fact , the government seems so intent on pushing the process forward that it appears to be displaying unprecedented flexibility in the terms it is willing to accept , i.e. the potential dropping of the new money component . 
However , the one thing that could still derail the agreement is the possibility that Minister of Economy [PER Boudou  ] might be fired . 
Over the last few days , there have been press reports to the effect that [PER Boudou  ] is on his way out due to the problems caused to the government by his handling of the [ORG BCRA  ] leadership imbroglio and the controversial [ORG Bicentennial Fund  ] . 
Embassy sources discount these rumors at this point , and say that he is likely to stay on at least until the debt swap is completed . 
( And [PER Boudou  ] got a new public vote of confidence from Cabinet Chief [PER Fernandez  ] on February 24 . 
) Given that he has been the champion within the government of a solution to the holdout problem , his continued presence is crucial . 
If he goes now , it is unlikely that the restructuring agreement will be completed anytime soon .
