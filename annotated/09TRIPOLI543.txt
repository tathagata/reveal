STATE  ] 52146 B. TRIPOLI 427 CLASSIFIED BY: [PER Gene A. Cretz  ] , Ambassador , [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy [LOC Tripoli  ] , [ORG Department of State  ] . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Summary: Working-level Government of Libya  ] ( [ORG GOL  ] ) representatives reported that preparations were underway for transfer of [LOC Libya  ] 's highly enriched uranium ( [ORG HEU  ] ) , with shipment planned for September 29 . 
Based on their extensive preparations for the transfer , working-level [ORG GOL  ] representatives believe PM al-Mahmoud al-Baghdadi will sign the bilateral agreement to transfer the [ORG HEU  ] to [LOC Russia  ] , but [ORG MFA A/S-equivalent Ahmed Fituri  ] separately told us that Al-Baghdadi could prove to be an obstacle . 
[PER Fituri  ] nevertheless was confident that the agreement would be signed . 
End summary . 
MOVING SLOWLY...BUT IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION ? 2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) During a June 27-29 [ORG DOE  ] visit to the [ORG Tajoura Nuclear Research Center  ] , Dr. [PER Ali Gashut  ] , Secretary of the [ORG National Authority for Scientific Research  ] , said that the [ORG GOL  ] 's nuclear spent fuel-return agreement was currently with PM-equivalent al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi , whom [PER Gashut  ] believed would sign the agreement on behalf of the [ORG GOL  ] . 
[PER Gashut  ] indicated that al-Baghdadi would sign the agreement , which has been in his office since May ( ref B ) , within a week . 
Meanwhile , a [MISC Russian  ] [ORG Department of Energy  ] counterpart indicated to the [ORG DOE  ] team that the [ORG GOL  ] 's parallel agreement with [LOC Russia  ] to accept [LOC Libya  ] 's nuclear spent fuel was also in al-Baghdadi 's office , although the [MISC Russian  ] did not have any other specific information regarding that agreement . 
FLIGHT OF THE TOXIC WASTE 3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [LOC Tajoura  ] facility is planning to receive [ORG DOE  ] containers in late July , which will be used to transport the nuclear spent fuel to [LOC Russia  ] for final disposal . 
[ORG DOE  ] and the [LOC Tajoura  ] facility are preparing the final shipment to take place early in the morning of September 29 , via an [MISC Antonov  ] 124-100 stretch plane that will fly out of [ORG Metiga Air Base  ] . 
The shipment is expected to arrive in [LOC Russia  ] on the evening of September 29 . 
4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [ORG GOL  ] has made clear that it does not want its high-level waste to return to [LOC Libya  ] after it has been treated in [LOC Russia  ] . 
The [ORG GOL  ] has already agreed to pay a fee of USD $30,000 to have the [MISC Russians  ] bury it in a secure location . 
[ORG BUREAUCRACY  ] AT WORK 5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG MFA A/S-equivalent  ] [PER Fituri  ] tempered [PER Gashut  ] 's optimism regarding the [ORG GOL  ] 's nuclear spent fuel-agreement during a July 6 meeting with the [ORG DCM  ] . 
After [PER Gashut  ] had interrupted the meeting to seek [PER Fituri  ] 's clearance on the [ORG GOL  ] 's draft response to ISN DAS Mitman 's letter regarding the transfer agreement , [PER Fituri  ] hinted that PM al-Baghdadi had put a hold on moving the agreement forward for reasons he did not know xxxxxxxxxxxx . 
During a brief encounter in Sirte on July 3 , the Ambassador stressed to the Prime Minister that he needed to resolve this issue very quickly if we were to move to expand further cooperation . 
[PER Fituri  ] said that he had pointed out how problematic the issue was for FM-equivalent [PER Musa Kusa  ] . 
[PER Fituri  ] thought their next move would be to raise the matter with Colonel al-Qadhafi during his visit to [LOC Italy  ] for the [ORG G-8 Summit  ] xxxxxxxxxxxx . 
In a separate July 8 meeting , [PER Fituri  ] clarified that FM [PER Kusa  ] had recommended approval of the transfer and predicted that [LOC Libya  ] would meet its obligations , although the timing may be a bit later than desired ( septel ) . 
6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Comment: [PER Fituri  ] 's comments hint at power-jockeying within the [MISC Libyan  ] bureaucracy , and post expects to receive positive news on the agreement once the dust settles . 
The [ORG GOL  ] is fully aware that there will be no movement on further cooperation in the civilian nuclear field until [LOC Libya  ] fulfills its commitments on the shipment . 
Post will continue to press the [ORG GOL  ] to fulfill its nuclear program agreements and to raise the seriousness of the issue at the highest possible levels . 
End comment .
