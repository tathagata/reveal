Pyatt  ] for Reasons 1.4 ( B , D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [ORG India’s  ] over 150 million [MISC Muslim  ] population is largely unattracted to extremism . 
[ORG India’s  ] growing economy , vibrant democracy , and inclusive culture , encourage [MISC Muslims  ] to seek success and social mobility in the mainstream and reduces alienation . 
With [MISC Indian Muslim  ] youth increasingly comfortable in the mainstream , the pool of potential recruits is shrinking , while [MISC Muslim  ] families and communities provide little sanction or support to extremist appeals . 
This cable is in response to Reftel requesting information on methods used by extremist groups to recruit and train youths under the age of 18 . 
Post notes that [LOC India  ] is home to a wide variety of extremist groups , including religious extremists ( [MISC Hindu  ] , [MISC Muslim  ] and [MISC Sikh  ] ) , ethnic separatists , and extremists from the political left ( Naxalites ) and right ( primarily [MISC Hindu  ] fascists ) , all of whom recruit children . 
However , reftel requests information only on [MISC Islamic  ] extremist groups such as [ORG Al-Qa’ida  ] , [ORG Ansar al-Sunnah  ] , the [ORG Abu Sayyaf Group  ] ( [ORG ASG  ] ) , the [ORG Taliban  ] and [PER Kashmiri  ] militants , and we will confine our analysis to such groups . 
The [MISC Muslim  ] Minority ------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) According to [ORG India’s  ] 1991 [ORG National Census  ] , the [MISC Muslim  ] population constitutes just under 15 percent of the country’s total . 
It grew by 33 percent between 1981-2001 , while the general population increased by 24 percent . 
[PER Islam  ] is [ORG India’s  ] largest minority religion . 
In many towns and cities , particularly in [LOC Northern India  ] , one third or more of the population is [MISC Muslim  ] . 
The largest concentrations of [MISC Muslims  ] live in the states of [LOC Bihar  ] ( 12 million ) , [LOC West Bengal  ] ( 16 million ) , and [LOC Uttar Pradesh  ] ( 24 million ) . 
The overwhelming majority ( 92 percent ) are [MISC Sunnis  ] , the remainder being [MISC Shias  ] . 
[ORG India’s  ] [MISC Muslim  ] population is estimated to be as large as 150 million ( the second largest in the world after [LOC Indonesia  ] ) , and suffers from higher rates of poverty than most other groups in [LOC India  ] , and can be the victims of discrimination and prejudice . 
Despite this , the vast majority remain committed to the [MISC Indian  ] state and seek to participate in mainstream political and economic life . 
Only a small number of young [PER Muslims  ] have concluded that mainstream politics will never address their grievances and have gravitated toward pan-Islamic and pro-Pakistan organizations , which sometimes engage in acts of violence . 
[ORG India’s  ] vibrant democracy , inclusive culture and growing economy have made it easier for [MISC Muslim  ] youth to find a place in the mainstream , reduced the pool of potential recruits , and the space in which [MISC Islamic  ] extremist organizations can operate . 
A Vibrant Democracy ------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Although there are a wide variety of [MISC Islamic  ] religious , political and social organizations , most [MISC Muslims  ] join or support secular groups without a specific [MISC Islamic  ] identity . 
The ruling [ORG United Progressive Alliance  ] ( [ORG UPA  ] ) , spearheaded by [ORG Congress  ] , projects itself as the secular alternative to the opposition [ORG National Democratic Alliance  ] ( [ORG NDA  ] ) , dominated by the Hindu-nationalist [ORG BJP  ] . 
[MISC Muslims  ] generally join secular parties as the best way to ensure that the [ORG BJP  ] does not attain political power , although the [ORG BJP  ] NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00009127 002.2 OF 006 does have [MISC Muslim  ] members as well . 
No exclusively [MISC Muslim  ] organization has succeeded in mobilizing more than a small portion of the [MISC Muslim  ] faithful . 
[MISC Muslim  ] organizations that support terrorism against the [MISC Indian  ] state and non-Muslim [MISC Indians  ] are very small and lack influence or popular following outside of [LOC Kashmir  ] . 
[ORG India’s  ] vibrant democracy has ensured that the large [MISC Muslim  ] community has a voice in politics and recent elections have demonstrated that [MISC Muslim  ] voters are courted actively by political parties . 
With a [MISC Muslim  ] President ( [PER Abdul Kalam  ] ) occupying the highest political position in the country , [PER Muslims  ] have been encouraged to seek political power in electoral and parliamentary politics , all but eliminating the appeal of violent extremism . 
Growing Economy --------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG India’s  ] secular education system increasingly integrates [MISC Muslim  ] students into the mainstream and has spawned a growing and prosperous [MISC Muslim  ] middle class . 
[PER Muslims  ] , like [MISC Indians  ] generally , rely on education and [MISC English  ] language competence to provide access to increased job opportunities . 
In the past , extremist groups focused on [MISC Indian  ] universities as potential recruiting grounds , but the economic upturn has transformed this dynamic . 
Most [MISC Muslims  ] approaching graduation from University will be prepared to enter the job market and are not interested in extremism . 
This cuts down the time when [MISC Muslim  ] students are vulnerable to extremist recruitment and compels extremist organizations to target younger students . 
Economic growth has spawned dramatic social change and [MISC Muslim  ] extremists must find potential recruits who have not yet participated in or benefited from the economic boom , consumer capitalism and the attractions of the media . 
These groups are likely to reject any recruit who has already been enticed away from [MISC Islamic  ] separatism into secular values . 
And an [MISC Inclusive Culture  ] ------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In order for [MISC Islamic  ] extremism to be attractive to [MISC Indian  ] [MISC Muslim  ] youth , they would have to feel alienated from the mainstream culture . 
While [PER Muslims  ] are often victimized and discriminated against , traditional barriers to cultural integration are breaking down . 
[PER Young  ] and dynamic [MISC Muslims  ] are popular culture heroes in sports ( [PER Sania Mirza  ] ) and Bollywood ( [PER Sharrukh Khan  ] and many others ) . 
The message for young [PER Muslims  ] is that they are [MISC Indians  ] first and [MISC Muslims  ] second , and that they can fully participate in [MISC Indian  ] society and culture and win the adulation and respect of other [MISC Indians  ] , regardless of religion . 
[LOC Kashmir  ] - The Exception ----------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [LOC Jammu  ] and [LOC Kashmir  ] , [ORG India’s  ] only [MISC Muslim  ] majority state , is characterized by a different kind of political [PER Islam  ] . 
[PER Kashmiri Muslims  ] , like many of their counterparts throughout [LOC South Asia  ] , have been historically heavily influenced by [PER Sufi Islam  ] , but because of their majority status and geographic isolation in a remote princely state , never saw themselves as part of the [MISC Islamic  ] mainstream in pre-partition [LOC India  ] . 
[PER Kashmiri Muslims  ] have worked actively to maintain a separate identity and have resisted NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00009127 003.2 OF 006 integration . 
This has been compounded by the turbulence and terrorism that have engulfed the state since 1989 . 
The [PER Kashmiri  ] sense of separateness permeates the programs and manifestos of [MISC Kashmir’s Islamic  ] groups , and [PER Kashmiri Muslims  ] have not embraced [MISC Indian  ] Muslims’ aspirations for national integration . 
Moreover , many [PER Kashmiri Muslims  ] have parted company with their [MISC Indian  ] [MISC Muslim  ] counterparts and embraced [PER Wahhabi Islam  ] during the insurgency . 
While [MISC Indian  ] [PER Muslims  ] feel compelled to express support for their co-religionists in [LOC Kashmir  ] , they tend to look upon Kashmiris with suspicion and try to keep the [PER Kashmiri  ] cause at arm’s length . 
The Extremists -------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Separatism and religious extremism have little appeal to [MISC Indian  ] [PER Muslims  ] , and the overwhelming majority espouse moderate doctrines . 
While the conservative [MISC Sunni  ] political organization the [ORG Jamaat Islami  ] ( [ORG JI  ] ) and the [MISC Deobandi  ] sect espouse [MISC Islamic  ] chauvinism , and some of their members express admiration for Osama bin [PER Ladin  ] , their leaders usually do not express such views in public , and there is little to indicate that they have provided anything more than rhetorical support to terrorists . 
Attacks by [MISC Hindu  ] extremists on innocent [PER Muslims  ] and periodic bouts of bloody communal rioting , have led a small number of [MISC Muslims  ] to cross the line from sympathizing with violence to engaging in terrorism . 
Some [PER Kashmiri  ] terrorist groups argue that only attacks outside of [LOC Kashmir  ] will shake the [MISC Indian  ] state and convince the [ORG GOI  ] to withdraw . 
Members of these two small slivers of the [MISC Muslim  ] community provide recruits for groups prone to acts of violence and terrorism , many of which are supported from outside [LOC India  ] . 
The numbers are small , especially outside of [LOC Kashmir  ] , but they remain capable of periodic bombings and other acts of violence. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [MISC Indian Islamic  ] groups that are extreme in their views and activities include [ORG Students Islamic Movement of India  ] ( [ORG SIMI  ] ) [PER Jamiat-ul-Mujahideen Marqazi-Jamiyat-e-Ahal-e-Hadith  ] ( [ORG MJAH  ] ) [ORG Muslim United Liberation Front of Assam  ] ( [ORG MULFA  ] ) [ORG Muslim Security Council  ] of [ORG Assam  ] ( [ORG MSCA  ] ) [ORG Muslim Volunteer Force  ] ( [ORG MVF  ] ) [ORG Muslim Liberation Army  ] ( [ORG MLA  ] ) [ORG Muslim Security Force  ] ( [ORG MSF  ] ) [MISC Islamic  ] [PER Sevak Sangh  ] ( [ORG ISS  ] ) [ORG United Muslim Liberation Front  ] of [ORG Assam  ] ( [ORG UMLFA  ] ) <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) In addition , the [ORG Lashkar-e-Toiba  ] ( [ORG LeT  ] ) and the [MISC Jaish-e-Muhammad  ] ( JeM ) are [MISC Pakistan-based  ] groups which recruit [MISC Indian  ] [PER Muslims  ] . 
[ORG Hizbul Mujahideen  ] is a [PER Kashmiri  ] terrorist group which works closely with the [MISC Pakistan-based  ] organizations . 
The [ORG MJAH  ] is a nationwide organization for [MISC Muslims  ] who subscribe to [PER Wahhabi Islam  ] . 
Since the overwhelming majority of [MISC Indian  ] Sunnis belong to the more liberal [ORG Barelvi  ] and [MISC Deobandi  ] schools , the [PER Wahhabi  ] sect has relatively few adherents , and only a small segment of [MISC Indian  ] Wahabis endorse the [ORG MJAH  ] and its views . 
The group is very small and press accounts have periodically linked it to bombings , most recently in [LOC Mumbai  ] . 
[ORG SIMI  ] was originally founded to provide spiritual guidance to [MISC Muslim  ] university students , but drifted into extremist politics and terrorism , and was subsequently banned by the [ORG GOI  ] in 2001 . 
Individual NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00009127 004.2 OF 006 [ORG SIMI  ] members are periodically arrested and prosecuted , but the group is largely dormant . 
[ORG LeT  ] and JeM have cells in [LOC India  ] which have committed terrorist attacks , primarily in J & K , but elsewhere as well . 
The [ORG GOI  ] has stated that the [ORG LeT  ] is the principal suspect in the recent deadly bombings in [LOC Delhi  ] , which killed over 70 persons . 
Most [MISC Indians  ] , both [MISC Muslim  ] and non-Muslim , view members of these groups as subversive agents of a hostile power , [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
Answers to Specific Questions ----------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Question A -- Recruitment As explained above , there are two distinct threads of [MISC Islamic  ] extremism in [LOC India  ] , which can overlap , but are largely separate ; [PER Kashmiri  ] groups , which are both [MISC Islamic  ] and ethnic , and non-Kashmiri groups , which emphasize a primarily religious identity while [PER Kashmiri  ] groups have recruited boys under the age of 18 , other extremist groups have concentrated on University students , who are often above the age of 18 . 
[LOC Kashmir  ] has been embroiled in terrorism for decades , exposing children to violence at an early age . 
Decades of conflict , a high casualty rate , and war-weariness has shrunk the pool of recruits for [PER Kashmiri  ] terrorist groups and they have turned to younger boys. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Most experts believe that terrorism in [PER Kashmiri  ] is now largely a non-Kashmiri affair . 
A study by a private think tank on recruitment into [MISC Indian  ] terrorist organizations verified that [PER Kashmiri  ] terrorist groups are the only [MISC Islamic  ] groups specifically to recruit juveniles . 
The report claims that children have participated in terrorist attacks in [LOC Kashmir  ] since the early 1990s , when there were documented cases of juveniles throwing grenades at security force pickets . 
Inspector-General of Police [PER K. Rajendra  ] said in October 2003 that perhaps only a handful of children have been involved in actual incidents , that in 2002 the [LOC Kashmir  ] police knew of the recruitment of approximately 100 child recruitments , and that the number increased to approximately 500 in 2003 . 
According to the study , the terrorist groups have evolved a specific method of juvenile recruitment . 
A ‘scout’ or ‘overground worker’ surveys an area and identifies boys from poor families within the target age group . 
On a given day , the terrorists abduct the identified targets at gun-point and take them to a hideout . 
The groups target schools , as exemplified in July 2003 , when a [ORG LeT  ] recruiter walked into the playground of the [ORG National High School  ] at the small [LOC Bandipora  ] village of [LOC Vijhar  ] in the [LOC Baramulla  ] district . 
Security forces subsequently rescued a group of six children from the [ORG LeT  ] ‘scout.’ Some of the rescued children had repeatedly failed school examinations and others had dropped out to take unpaid apprenticeships in dead-end jobs . 
Police assert that families are coerced to ‘donate’ a younger son to the ‘jihad’ and that refusal to comply could result in the death of the entire family . 
Since 2003 , the border has become less porous , the appeal of joining terrorist groups has diminished , and there are fewer media accounts of child abductions and rescues. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Some prominent instances demonstrating patterns of child recruitment include: --On 6 August 2001 , security forces intercepted three terrorists forcibly taking 12 young boys at gunpoint to [LOC NEW DELHI  ] 00009127 005.2 OF 006 [LOC Pakistan  ] for training and induction into their ranks . 
As the young boys ran towards the security forces for safety , the terrorists fired on them killing one boy and injuring another , the security forces rescued the remainder. --In July-August 2001 , security forces rescued 39 young boys in the age group of 14-18 , being taken at gun point to [LOC Pakistan  ] for training. --In 2003 , an estimated 500 teenagers were recruited into various terrorist outfits in [LOC J&K  ] . 
The child recruits received rudimentary arms training , but primarily worked as cooks , cleaners , porters and guides for terrorists <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Outside of [LOC Kashmir  ] , [MISC Islamic  ] organizations in [MISC Indian  ] universities have some success recruiting [MISC Muslim  ] students , many from rural backgrounds and away from home for the first time . 
Those who stay with such groups can become increasingly isolated from the mainstream and are attractive recruits for [MISC Islamic  ] extremists . 
Our contacts tell us , however , that most [MISC Muslim  ] students lose interest in such groups as they become more comfortable in their new environments . 
The [MISC Indian  ] media has published colorful stories implying that [ORG Madrassas  ] are recruiting centers for [MISC Islamic  ] terrorism and that many are funded by [ORG Pakistan’s ISI  ] . 
The accounts are mostly anecdotal , however , and there has been little or no hard evidence linking [MISC Indian  ] [ORG Madrassas  ] to terrorist recruitment . 
[ORG Madrassas  ] originally started at the secondary level and were confined to boys , with most [MISC Muslim  ] children attending public primary schools in their own villages . 
The [MISC Deobandi  ] sect is establishing a series of primary schools for [MISC North Indian  ] boys and girls . 
Their goal is to provide madrassa education for children from age five through university level . 
There is some concern that this move could isolate children from the mainstream and make them more prone to extremism or susceptible to recruitment into terrorist groups. question B -- Characteristics of Recruits <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [MISC Muslim  ] contacts tell us that young recruits in [LOC Kashmir  ] are those who have been brutalized by violence , lost loved ones , or have personally experienced repression by the [MISC Indian  ] security forces . 
Many are bent on revenge . 
As in most war-torn areas , children brutalized by their environment can begin to see violence as a normal career path and can divorce it from any ideological justification . 
Non-Kashmiri recruits are said to be primarily from blue collar or poor families with limited education and from a rural or urban slum background . 
They can find higher education to be a painful process and have trouble adjusting to a radically different environment , and can embrace radical [MISC Islam  ] as a coping mechanism , as the [MISC Islamic  ] groups welcome them and provide them with a warm and familiar environment . 
In [LOC Gujarat  ] and [LOC Western India  ] , particularly in [LOC Mumbai  ] , many [MISC Muslims  ] were traumatized by anti-Muslim rioting following the destruction of [LOC Babri Mosque  ] in 1992 , and the [LOC Godhra  ] train violence of 2002 . 
We speculate that their principal motivation is revenge for senseless and painful attacks inflicted on them , their families , and their communities by [MISC Hindu  ] extremists. question C -- Juveniles and the [ORG Advancement of Terrorist Goals  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER Kashmiri  ] groups , facing a limited manpower pool and [LOC NEW DELHI  ] 00009127 006 OF 006 heavily outnumbered by the [MISC Indian  ] security forces , have seen a harsh attrition as their members are killed , imprisoned , or fall away . 
Like terrorist groups in other countries facing a similar dilemma ( the [ORG LTTE  ] in [LOC Sri Lanka  ] for example ) , they have recruited younger and younger members . 
In addition , [MISC Kashmiri  ] adults have largely tired of violence and extremism and are less receptive to terrorist recruitment . 
In such an environment , children are more pliable and less resistant . 
They can also provide a lifetime of service , in a conflict that seems to go on without end . 
Other [MISC Islamic  ] extremist groups have a similar dilemma , in that [MISC Islamic  ] extremism is not popular in [LOC India  ] and most adults are not interested . 
This forces extremists to pitch to young and naive audiences who may be more amenable. question D -- [ORG Rehabilitation Methods  ] <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) Since there is relatively little recruitment of juveniles into extremist groups , especially outside of [LOC Kashmir  ] , there is no GOI program aimed specifically at rehabilitating them . 
We know of no instances where child terrorists have been captured . 
In those instances where abducted children are rescued , the security forces return them to their parents. question E -- Reasons why Extremists May Refrain from Juvenile Recruitment <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [LOC Kashmir  ] has had the most experience with recruitment of juveniles into extremist groups . 
Enthusiasm there for the separatist/terrorist cause has largely waned , and the organizations there are concerned that they could become totally isolated and liable to be crushed by the security services if their popular support dries up . 
Cost benefit analysis would convince most such groups that the cost of losing support from the local community is too high for the small benefit provided by youthful recruits . 
Outside [LOC Kashmir  ] , [MISC Muslims  ] are facing the same pressures for social mobility as non-Muslims . 
Most [MISC Indian  ] children are under pressure to get into school , stay in school , and perform well there , in order to obtain higher education and access to well-paid jobs . 
Attempts by extremist groups to recruit children from [MISC Muslim  ] homes are likely to run into a wall of opposition from parents who would see involvement in extremism as counterproductive and a threat to future success of their children . 
This means that extremism is most attractive to children from families that are so poor that opportunities for education and advancement are all but non-existent . 
As the [MISC Indian  ] economy continues to boom , the percentage of [MISC Muslim  ] families who feel there is no hope for their children’s’ future is growing smaller , as is the pool of potential recruits .
