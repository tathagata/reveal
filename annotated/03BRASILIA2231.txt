( C ) Summary . 
In an informal discussion with econoff on July 13 , [PER Regis Arslanian  ] , the [ORG GOB  ] 's new director of [ORG FTAA  ] and [MISC Mercosul-EU  ] negotiations , acknowledged that [ORG Mercosul  ] was disappointed with the reaction it received during the [LOC San Salvador  ] [ORG TNC  ] meeting to its proposal for restructuring the [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations and suggested that [LOC Brazil  ] could accept a compromise reformulation with the [LOC United States  ] . 
According to [PER Arslanian  ] , a bilateral structure for market access discussions is a key element for the [ORG GOB  ] . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On July 13 , while traveling back to [LOC Brasilia  ] from the [ORG FTAA Trade Negotiating Committee  ] ( [ORG TNC  ] ) meeting in [LOC San Salvador  ] ( July 8-11 ) , econoff discussed [ORG Mercosul  ] 's take on the meeting with [PER Regis Percy Arslanian  ] . 
[PER Arslanian  ] has been advisor to [ORG Itamaraty  ] Secretary-General [PER Pinheiro Guimaraes  ] , but told Econoff that he has been chosen to replace Ambassador [PER Carlos Simas Magalhaesas  ] as Head of the [ORG International Negotiations Department  ] ( [ORG FTAA  ] and [MISC Mercosul-EU  ] negotiations ) under Ambassador [PER Luiz Filipe Macedo Soares  ] , who is Under Secretary for [LOC South America  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] 's lead [ORG FTAA  ] negotiator at the Vice-Minister level . 
Earlier , econoff was told by [PER Tovar  ] da [PER Silva Nunes  ] , the [ORG GOB  ] 's [ORG FTAA  ] Coordinator , that [PER Simas  ] had been sacked on July 4 for not being in-sync with [ORG Itamaraty  ] [ORG FTAA  ] policy directives. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) According to [PER Arslanian  ] , [ORG Mercosul  ] was extremely disappointed by the reaction it received at the [ORG TNC  ] meeting to its three-track proposal for restructuring the [ORG FTAA  ] . 
Roughly speaking , the three tracks refer to: [ORG Track  ] 1- bilateral market access negotiations ( industrial and agricultural goods , services , and investment ) carried out under the [ORG FTAA  ] umbrella ; [ORG Track  ] 2- minimal rules to support market access such as dispute settlement , rules of origin , civil society , institutional issues , [ORG Hemispheric Cooperation Program  ] , etc. ; and [ORG Track  ] 3 - rules for services and investment , intellectual property , competition policy , market access and rules for government procurement , domestic support , and trade remedies , all of which would be considered only in the [LOC WTO.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG Mercosul  ] presented its proposal in the [ORG TNC  ] plenary , but the bulk of discussion took place in an informal session during which most countries expressed concern with , and to a certain extent criticism of , [ORG Mercosul  ] 's intention to reduce the scope of the [ORG FTAA  ] . 
[PER Arslanian  ] said that the [LOC United States  ] and other countries did not fully appreciate the intense domestic political and social pressure the [ORG GOB  ] is under , and reiterated that it would be impossible for Brazil/Mercosul to complete the [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations as currently structured. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) While other countries have suggested that a comprehensive [ORG FTAA  ] in both market access and rules is necessary to foster economic integration and prosperity in the region by encouraging strategic hemispheric partnerships and attracting foreign direct investment , [LOC Brazil  ] sees its strategic needs differently . 
[PER Arslanian  ] emphasized two points: the importance of the [LOC U.S.  ] market for [MISC Brazilian  ] goods ; and the importance of bilateral market access negotiations as envisioned in [ORG Mercosul  ] 's three-track proposal. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Arslanian  ] stressed the [ORG GOB  ] 's interest in negotiating access to the [LOC U.S.  ] market within the [ORG FTAA  ] . 
However , he registered disbelief that the [LOC U.S.  ] is serious about giving duty-free treatment to certain sensitive products , citing orange juice and steel , in particular . 
Econoff rebutted that in the initial [LOC U.S.  ] goods offer every tariff item was within one of the four product baskets , each of which is slated to go to zero-duty at some time , but pointed out that with [ORG Mercosul  ] 's proposed wholesale removal of a number of issues of interest to the [LOC United States  ] from the [ORG FTAA  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] would undoubtedly have difficulty justifying such a comprehensive market opening . 
In response , [PER Arslanian  ] said [ORG Mercosul  ] would be willing to negotiate market access in financial services and telecommunications with the [LOC United States  ] as trade-offs . 
Pressed on whether [ORG Mercosul  ] would really be offering anything new in these areas , he answered emphatically in the affirmative. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) In explaining [LOC Brazil  ] 's rationale for seeking a bilateral negotiating structure , [PER Arslanian  ] said that [LOC Brazil  ] believes other countries in the region ( [MISC Central Americans  ] , etc . 
) are willing to give away much more than [LOC Brazil  ] is in market access for services and investment to gain an opening of the [LOC U.S.  ] goods market . 
He reiterated several times that [LOC Brazil  ] will not " level " its interests to those of other countries and would not accept a structure that would force [LOC Brazil  ] to make concessions based on other countries' willingness to " give away the store . 
" Echoing comments made by [ORG Mercosul  ] 's [MISC Uruguayan  ] lead during the [ORG TNC  ] , [PER Arslanian  ] also said that a bilateral process could focus the negotiation more specifically on the interests of the parties involved and make it easier to identify for political leaders and society at large the trade-offs that are made to reach an agreement . 
He claimed that [ORG Mercosul  ] will not submit any offers in services , investment and government procurement until a bilateral negotiating structure is approved. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Arslanian  ] asked why the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation to the [ORG TNC  ] did not discuss a baseline agreement approach that he believed the [ORG USG  ] had contemplated . 
Econoff responded simply that the [ORG USG  ] did not have an official proposal to put forward . 
[PER Arslanian  ] bemoaned the lack of such a discussion , opining that between the three-track proposal and a baseline agreement approach , a compromise could probably be reached , as long as it includes a bilateral market access structure . 
He intimidated that [ORG Mercosul  ] could agree to include government procurement market access under the [ORG FTAA  ] and that the negotiating forum for rules in services and investment , and [ORG IPR  ] could be revisited . 
[PER Arslanian  ] also wondered aloud about the possibility of a two-stage process , with deepening ( read as rules ) coming in stage two , but was silent when asked by econoff what guarantee the [LOC U.S.  ] would have that [LOC Brazil  ] would undertake stage two negotiations if it obtained the market access for goods that it wanted in stage one. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Arslanian  ] seemed eager to encourage a dialog with the [LOC United States  ] to develop a vision for the [ORG FTAA  ] that would satisfy both countries' needs . 
Given his past position in the [ORG Itamaraty  ] Secretary-General 's Office and his new position specifically overseeing the [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations , we are inclined to view his statements on [ORG GOB  ] priorities and possible flexibilities as credible . 
See septel for Mission 's overview and analysis of factors affecting the [ORG GOB  ] 's latest formulation of its [ORG FTAA  ] policy .
