<code><pre>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ZAGREB 000815 SIPDIS SENSITIVE SIPDIS EO 12958 N/A TAGS ECON , EINV , HR SUBJECT: NJ-BASED BARR LABS IN BIDDING WAR FOR CROATIA’S PLIVA <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
SUMMARY: NJ-BASED BARR LABS ANNOUNCED A 2.3 BILLION DOLLAR TAKEOVER BID FOR CROATIA’S PLIVA ON JUNE 28 , MARKING THE LARGEST SINGLE FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN [LOC CROATIA  ] AND SPARKING A BIDDING WAR WITH RIVAL SUITOR ACTAVIS PHARMACEUTICALS OF [LOC ICELAND  ] . 
ALTHOUGH BOTH PLIVA’S CEO AND THE GOC HAVE PUBLICLY ENDORSED A PLIVA-BARR MERGER , ACTAVIS RAISED THE STAKES LAST WEEK , REPORTEDLY BUYING NEARLY 10 PERCENT OF PLIVA’S SHARES . 
BARR HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO PURCHASE SHARES , PENDING REGULATORY APPROVAL IN THE [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC GERMANY  ] AND [LOC CROATIA  ] , BUT COMPANY OFFICIALS REMAIN CONFIDENT THAT THEIR OFFER WILL PREVAIL . 
EMBASSY HAS USED RECENT MEETINGS WITH GOC OFFICIALS AND PRESS STATEMENTS TO UNDERSCORE THE BENEFITS BOTH FOR [LOC CROATIA  ] AND PLIVA OF BARR’S OFFER . 
END SUMMARY ----------- BIDDING WAR ----------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
[ORG CROATIAN PHARMACEUTICAL  ] HEAVYWEIGHT PLIVA IS THE OBJECT OF A BIDDING WAR BETWEEN NJ-BASED BARR LABS AND ACTAVIS OF [LOC ICELAND  ] . 
PLIVA PUT ITSELF ON THE MARKET AND HIRED DEUTSCHEBANK AS ITS FINANCIAL ADVISOR , FOLLOWING WHAT IT CONSIDERED A HOSTILE AND LOW BID OFFER FROM ACTAVIS OF $1.6 BILLION IN THE SPRING . 
AT A RECEPTION HELD JUNE 28 IN ZAGREB , OFFICIALS FROM PLIVA AND BARR ANNOUNCED THAT THE TWO COMPANIES HAD REACHED AN AGREEMENT FOR BARR TO ACQUIRE PLIVA FOR $2.2 BILLION . 
HOWEVER , AT THE SAME TIME ACTAVIS MADE A COUNTER OFFER AND BEGAN BUYING PLIVA SHARES ON THE OPEN MARKET . 
BARR COUNTERED , UPPING ITS OFFER TO $2.3 BILLION . 
BARR SAID IT WOULD PAY PLIVA SHAREHOLDERS 743 [ORG KUNA  ] ( $131.28 ) PER SHARE , AS WELL AS A 12 [ORG KUNA  ] ( $2.12 ) DIVIDEND , FOR A TOTAL CASH CONSIDERATION OF 755 [ORG KUNA  ] ( $133.40 ) PER SHARE . 
THE CROATIAN PRESS HAS CORRECTLY CALLED BARR’S OFFER THE LARGEST [LOC U.S.  ] INVESTMENT EVER IN [LOC CROATIA.  ] ---------------------- [ORG Barr’s Plans  ] for [ORG Pliva  ] ---------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
BARR AND PLIVA ARE CURRENTLY ASSOCIATED THROUGH A JOINT VENTURE TO CREATE A GENERIC BIOLOGICAL VERSION OF A TREATMENT USED TO REGULATE WHITE BLOOD CELL PRODUCTION . 
THROUGH PLIVA , BARR WOULD GAIN ENTRY INTO [MISC RUSSIAN  ] AND OTHER EASTERN EUROPEAN MARKETS , AS WELL AS THE [LOC UK  ] , [LOC GERMANY  ] , [LOC SPAIN  ] AND [LOC ITALY  ] . 
A BARR- PLIVA UNION WOULD DOUBLE BARR’S ANNUAL SALES TO $2.5 BILLION AND BOOST THEIR COOPERATION IN RESEARCH AND GENERICS. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
BARR OFFICIALS SAID THE COMPANY WILL MAINTAIN PLIVA’S HEADQUARTERS IN ZAGREB AND KEEP ITS SENIOR MANAGEMENT IN PLACE . 
BARR HAS ABOUT 2,000 EMPLOYEES WHILE PLIVA HAS 6,000 , INCLUDING SOME IN EAST HANOVER , [LOC N.J.  ] --------------------- ACTAVIS STILL LURKING --------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
ACTAVIS HAS NOT GIVEN UP YET , NOTING THAT BARR STILL NEEDS A SUCCESSFUL REGULATORY REVIEW IN [LOC GERMANY  ] , THE HART-SCOTT-RODINO CLEARANCE IN THE [LOC U.S.  ] AND APPROVAL FROM THE CROATIAN AGENCY FOR SUPERVISION OF FINANCIAL SERVICES ( [ORG HANFA  ] ) . 
ACTAVIS CLAIMED IT DID NOT NEED THOSE APPROVALS , BUT [ORG PLIVA  ] OFFICIALS HAVE SAID THAT IS NOT ENTIRELY TRUE. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
MEANWHILE ACTAVIS HAS ALSO BEEN BUYING SHARES OF PLIVA ON THE OPEN MARKET , WHILE BARR AWAITS REGULATORY APPROVAL . 
AS A RESULT , ACTAVIS NOW OWNS 9.7 PERCENT OF PLIVA SHARES OUTRIGHT AND HAS OPTIONS ON A FURTHER 10.7 PERCENT . 
BARR CALLED ON PLIVA STOCK-HOLDERS JUNE 30 NOT TO SELL THEIR SHARES IN ORDER TO ALLOW REGULAR BIDDING . 
[ORG PLIVA  ] OFFICIALS ALSO ASKED SHAREHOLDERS TO REFRAIN FROM SELLING STOCK UNTIL ISSUES REGARDING THE OFFERS ARE RESOLVED. --------------------- CURRENT STATE OF PLAY --------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
[ORG Pliva  ] publicly endorsed [ORG Barr  ] and the [ORG GOC  ] echoed this endorsement , saying it is more important to ensure the [ORG Pliva  ] brand will continue , that production will continue in [LOC Croatia  ] and that the company’s workforce in [LOC Croatia  ] will not be reduced , than to gain an extra 10 kuna ( $1.76 ) per share . 
The [ORG GOC  ] , which retains 17 percent of Pliva’s shares , and [ORG Pliva  ] officials feel more secure with [ORG Barr  ] than with [MISC Activas  ] , which reputedly has links to [MISC Russian  ] capital . 
8 . 
Although [ORG Actavis  ] officials also have said they plan to retain the [ORG Pliva  ] name in [LOC Croatia  ] and transfer some production to [LOC Croatia  ] , analysts doubt [ORG Actavis’  ] true intentions . 
They point to [ORG Actavis’  ] activities in other countries where it operates with a significantly cheaper labor force . 
[ORG Actavis  ] has apparently been on an acquisition binge in the last few years , acquiring a portfolio of companies it is yet to integrate and a large amount of debt in the process . 
9 . 
[ORG Pliva  ] officials said [LOC U.S.  ] anti-trust agencies need to resolve issues regarding both offers . 
They also note that , according to the [ORG Croatian Takeover Law  ] , once a party directly or indirectly acquires over 25% of the voting shares of an issuer , it is obligated to immediately inform the issuer , the public and [ORG HANFA  ] . 
10 . 
Post has used recent meetings with the [ORG GOC  ] , including Ambassador’s farewell calls , to support [ORG Barr  ] . 
The [ORG GOC  ] is eager to see this deal succeed , which would not only be a good outcome for [ORG Pliva  ] , but would also send a signal of confidence about Croatia’s investment climate .
