( C ) Summary . 
During separate meetings at the [LOC Presidential Palace  ] , [ORG Foreign Policy Advisor  ] Marco [PER Aurelio Garcia  ] and Presidential Chief of Staff [PER Gilberto Carvalho  ] discussed with Ambassador [PER Shannon  ] their interest in working together on a range of regional and global issues , including [LOC Honduras  ] , [LOC Venezuela  ] , [LOC Haiti  ] , and non-proliferation issues . 
[PER Garcia  ] and [PER Carvalho  ] were impressed with the wide range of high-level [ORG USG  ] visits to [LOC Brazil  ] over the next month , and were eager at the prospect of increased dialogue with the [ORG USG  ] on critical issues . 
[PER Garcia  ] was interested in finding a strategy to rehabilitate former [MISC Honduran  ] President [PER Manuel Zelaya  ] ; he also reacted favorably to suggestions that the [LOC United States  ] is open to discussion with the [ORG Government of Venezuela  ] if the right interlocutors could be found . 
[PER Carvalho  ] was particularly interested in discussing long-range cooperation in [LOC Haiti  ] . 
End summary . 
[LOC Honduras  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG Marco  ] [PER Aurelio Garcia  ] , [PER Lula’s  ] highly influential [ORG Foreign Policy Advisor  ] , steered the conversation in his February 8 meeting toward [LOC Latin America  ] , his primary focus . 
He opened with the need for a “certain rehabilitation” of former President [PER Manuel Zelaya  ] , which he did not define in detail but characterized as “a little more than amnesty.” [PER Garcia  ] recognized that [PER Zelaya  ] is essentially conservative but argued that , as a catalyst of a popular movement in [LOC Honduras  ] , resentment regarding his dismissal will continue and can potentially destabilize [LOC Honduras  ] long-term if it is not addressed . 
In response to comments by the Ambassador that President [PER Lobo  ] is open to re-establishing normal diplomatic channels with [LOC Brazil  ] , [PER Garcia  ] took on a conciliatory tone and acknowledged that some degree of communication with [PER Lobo  ] - “an exchange of notes” - has already taken place . 
[LOC Venezuela  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Garcia  ] characterized [LOC Venezuela  ] as having deep domestic economic problems , particularly with regard to energy supply . 
He believed that President [PER Chavez  ] would be forced to step back substantially from the “foreign policy of oil” in order to attend to domestic concerns . 
He emphasized that [PER Lula  ] tells [PER Chavez  ] regularly that [LOC Venezuela  ] “needs to escape from oil.” [LOC Brazil  ] is willing to help , [PER Garcia  ] said , by providing agricultural assistance to the [ORG GOV  ] and support in building [MISC Venezuela’s  ] hydroelectric capacity , among other areas. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Shannon  ] said that [MISC Venezuela’s  ] problems were increasingly intractable , and that the internal domestic problems they were generating were pushing [PER Chavez  ] toward more authoritarianism and repression . 
He noted that our efforts at outreach had all been rebuffed by [PER Chavez  ] , and that the lack of any reliable interlocutors made dialogue with [LOC Venezuela  ] almost impossible . 
[PER Garcia  ] asked if the [LOC United States  ] was still interested in dialogue . 
The Ambassador said yes . 
[PER Garcia  ] was visibly intrigued by this , indicating that [LOC Brazil  ] could be of assistance in this area . 
[LOC Bolivia  ] , [LOC Colombia  ] , [LOC Chile  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Garcia  ] spoke favorably about [MISC Bolivia’s  ] economy and government , and made the case that President [PER Morales  ] is more moderate than his words or image indicate . 
He downplayed any current tension between [LOC Bolivia  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] on hydrocarbons or other issues and suggested that [LOC Bolivia  ] under [PER Morales  ] should not be viewed as a concern for either the [LOC U.S.  ] or [LOC Brazil  ] . 
The Ambassador noted that the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Bolivia  ] had negotiated a draft bilateral framework agreement , but that the [PER Morales  ] government was unprepared to move forward on the agreement at this time . 
On [LOC Chile  ] , [PER Garcia  ] opined that the victory of [PER Sebastian Pinera  ] opens the door for the right to take power , and that he foresees serious problems between [LOC Chile  ] and [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
He conceded that [MISC Colombian  ] President [PER Uribe  ] will win again if he runs for re-election and that former Defense Minister [PER Juan Manuel Santos  ] will probably win if [PER Uribe  ] doesn’t run . 
[LOC Haiti  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [LOC Haiti  ] featured prominently in the Ambassador’s meeting February 9 with [PER Lula’s  ] personal Chief of Staff , [PER Gilberto Carvalho  ] . 
( [PER Note: Carvalho  ] , who has been Lula’s Chief of Staff ever since entering the Presidency in 2003 , normally focuses largely on [MISC Lula’s  ] schedule and on domestic political concerns . 
End note . 
) Speaking in terms that much resembled an earlier meeting between Ambassador [PER Shannon  ] and MRE Secretary General [PER Patriota  ] ( reftel ) , [PER Carvalho  ] and the Ambassador talked about [LOC Haiti  ] as an opportunity to provide a template for future joint U.S.-Brazil assistance efforts in the region , and also as a model for future [ORG UN  ] post-disaster efforts . 
[PER Carvalho  ] agreed with the need for the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] to prioritize plans for sustainable reconstruction strategy in the next stage of [LOC Haiti’s  ] recovery , and on the need to use security efforts to advance the development strategy in [LOC Haiti  ] . 
Visits and Coordination <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Carvalho  ] and [PER Garcia  ] both spoke briefly about President [PER Lula’s  ] upcoming international travel , including: - Feb 22-25 ( [LOC Cuba  ] , [LOC Mexico-for  ] the [ORG Summit of Latin American and Caribbean  ] nations-El [LOC Salvador  ] , [LOC Haiti  ] ) - Mar 13-15 ( [LOC Israel  ] , [LOC Palestine  ] , [LOC Jordan  ] ) - Apr 13-14 ( United States-for the [ORG Global Nuclear Security Summit  ] ) - Mid-May ( tentatively [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC Spain  ] ) Each responded favorably to suggestions of increased communication between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] at the executive level - including communication between President [PER Lula  ] and President [PER Obama  ] - both before and after official trips . 
Both were also impressed at the broad range of high-level [ORG USG  ] visitors to [LOC Brazil  ] planned for the next month .
