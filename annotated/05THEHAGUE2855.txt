Summary: [MISC Dutch  ] interlocutors expressed their appreciation for the opportunity to consult during the ongoing [ORG QDR  ] deliberations , and reacted favorably to the [ORG QDR  ] 's themes and emerging priorities . 
They inquired how [ORG QDR  ] might affect the [ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] ( [ORG JSF  ] ) program . 
They also drew parallels to their own attempts to enhance security sector reform in [LOC Africa  ] , and suggested enhancing ties between [ORG NATO  ] , the [ORG UN  ] , the [ORG EU  ] and the [ORG African Union  ] . 
End Summary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) During his consultations in The [ORG Hague  ] , DASD [PER Thomas  ] met with [ORG Admiral Nagtegaal  ] ( [ORG Defense Planning Process  ] ) , [PER BrigGen Veltman  ] ( [ORG International Military Cooperation  ] ) , and [PER Sebastian Reyn  ] ( Deputy Director , General Policy Directorate , [ORG MOD  ] ) . 
In attendance on the [ORG USG  ] side were Charge , DATT CAPT [PER Frank Buerger  ] , ODC Chief COL [PER David Kelly  ] , CAPT [PER Mac Bollman  ] , and [ORG Polmiloff Jason Grubb  ] . 
At the MFA , DASD [PER Thomas  ] met with [PER Robert de Groot  ] ( Director , Security and [ORG Defense Policy Department  ] ) , [PER Rob Gabrielse  ] ( Deputy Director , Conflict Prevention and [ORG Crisis Response Operations  ] ) , [PER Hans Sandee  ] ( Deputy Director , Security and [ORG Defense Policy  ] ) , [PER Karen van Stegeren  ] ( Advisor , [ORG International Security Policy  ] ) , and [PER Eric Strating  ] ( Security and [ORG Defense Policy  ] ) . 
DATT , CAPT [PER Bollman  ] and [ORG Polmiloff  ] attended for the [ORG USG  ] . 
[ORG MOD Meeting  ] -- Importance of [ORG Building Partner Capacity  ] --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) After thanking [ORG MoD  ] officials for [MISC Dutch  ] contributions to [LOC ISAF  ] , [LOC NTM-I  ] and Hurricane [PER Katrina relief  ] , and noting the importance of the [LOC Netherlands  ] as a long-standing [LOC U.S.  ] Ally , DASD [PER Thomas  ] opened consultations with [ORG MOD  ] officials by outlining major [ORG QDR  ] cross-cutting themes . 
He explained that the [ORG Pentagon  ] , in concert with other elements of national power , was emphasizing multinational preventive approaches to international security , including the maintenance and expansion of global civil society and peacetime engagement activities to prevent problems from becoming crises , and crises from becoming conflicts . 
Shoring up effective and legitimate governments and enabling partners is key -- as part of the [ORG QDR  ] , the [ORG Department of Defense  ] is exploring mechanisms to deepen partnerships not only with traditional , stable allies , but also with vulnerable states in the developing world . 
[PER Thomas  ] also noted the importance of the " " indirect approach " " for addressing the challenges posed by terrorist extremism -- working by , with , and through others to defeat the threat . 
He noted that while the [ORG QDR  ] emphasizes the need to develop new capabilities and skill sets associated with irregular warfare , such as language capabilities and cultural intelligence , [ORG DoD  ] would maintain its conventional capabilities . 
Finally , he explained that achieving unity of effort with other Federal , state and local agencies for homeland defense and homeland security was also an important theme in the [LOC QDR.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) [ORG Admiral Nagtegaal  ] said that the themes raised by [PER Thomas  ] suggested significant changes in security policy that extend beyond defense . 
[PER Thomas  ] agreed that the security challenges facing the [LOC Netherlands  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] demand holistic approaches that harness all instruments of national and allied power . 
Just as the [ORG Department of Defense  ] has a unified command plan that assigns " " supported " " and " " supporting " " roles and responsibilities for warfighters , he suggested the need to explore the development of similar arrangements across governments . 
He stressed the need for dialogue , and pointed to the [ORG NATO Defense Planning Committee  ] generation of force goals as a good example of multinational force planning . 
He suggested building upon that process to address a wider range of security challenges . 
The nature of the challenges we face are such , he said , that unilateral approaches cannot work . 
We must integrate multinational considerations more deeply into our national force planning . 
[ORG QDR Capability Priorities  ] ------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) DATT repeated a frequent question from [ORG MOD  ] contacts regarding how the [ORG USG  ] could afford the reforms required by the [ORG QDR  ] , especially following the financial aftermath of Hurricane [PER Katrina  ] . 
[PER Thomas  ] noted that [ORG DoD  ] faces a number of challenges , including ongoing operations , the growth of personnel health care costs , recapitalization of aging equipment , and the need to contribute to broader Federal deficit reduction efforts . 
That said , however , the [ORG QDR  ] was not simply a " " budget drill " " . 
He expected that there would be a number of proposals for new or increased investment in key areas , such as counterterrorism and homeland defense , and that any spending cuts would be made in light of the longer term strategic vision . 
[PER Thomas  ] outlined several emerging [ORG QDR  ] capability priorities , including homeland defense and , in concert with broader interagency efforts , developing medical countermeasures against advanced , genetically-engineered bio-terror agents . 
He noted that emerging non-lethal technologies might be used to hold and secure a multitude of WMD-producing sites for eventual disarmament . 
[PER Thomas  ] also outlined plans to increase the numbers/capabilities of [ORG DoD Explosive Ordinance Disposal  ] personnel to render safe nuclear devices , as well as irregular warfare training for general purpose forces and increases in some special operations forces. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) [PER Thomas  ] explained the importance of improving language and culture capabilities , in particular by attracting [MISC American  ] heritage speakers to join the military . 
[PER Thomas  ] stressed the need to recruit individuals who are not only bilingual but also bicultural to improve the [LOC U.S.  ] military 's local knowledge and cultural awareness in less familiar areas of the world . 
[PER Gen. Veltman  ] related problems the [MISC Dutch  ] faced in attracting individuals from different ethnic backgrounds to join the military -- often , these individuals or their families feel threatened if they cooperate with [MISC Dutch  ] forces . 
Charge [MISC Blakeman  ] suggested that linguistic skill was perhaps a contribution that the [LOC Netherlands  ] and other [ORG NATO  ] countries could make in future coalition operations ; [PER Gen. Veltman  ] concurred . 
[PER Thomas  ] noted that such contributions would be welcomed. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) [PER Thomas  ] noted that enhancing deterrence was also an important topic within the [ORG QDR  ] and in this regard stressed the importance of missile defenses to deter adversaries through the prospect of denying their objectives . 
He also noted that achieving Persistent [MISC Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance  ] ( [ORG ISR  ] ) capabilities was another area of emphasis in the [ORG QDR  ] . 
In this regard , he explained that avoiding a " " [LOC Pearl Harbor  ] " " scenario in which space assets could be attacked was a concern . 
[PER Thomas  ] also related recent cyber operations originating from [LOC China  ] appear to have targeted [ORG USG  ] unclassified computer networks , resulting in large volumes of compromised information pertaining to logistics and defense acquisition programs . 
As such , net centricity and information assurance capabilities are vital . 
Affect on [ORG JSF  ] ? -------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) Adm. [PER Nagtegaal  ] asked how the [ORG QDR  ] might affect plans for the [ORG JSF  ] program . 
[PER Thomas  ] explained that no decisions have been taken on [ORG JSF  ] but that deliberations are ongoing . 
Multinational participation in the program is a consideration . 
He said that [ORG QDR  ] deliberations were informed by a long-term strategic framework and the transition over time to unmanned aircraft . 
In this regard , he noted that [ORG JSF  ] would likely be the last major manned tactical aircraft program . 
A key question would be how [ORG JSF  ] and other aircraft programs would fit into such a transition . 
[ORG DoD  ] is looking at a number of options , including reducing the number of [ORG JSF  ] variants . 
[PER Thomas  ] noted that international participation informed deliberations about the program . 
He noted that on their current timelines some of the studies and analyses that would inform decisions on [ORG JSF  ] would not be completed until after the [ORG QDR  ] report was submitted . 
Thus , some decisions might not be made until sometime in 2006 . 
Adm. [PER Nagtegaal  ] said that he would advise his leadership that reducing the number of [ORG JSF  ] variants was under consideration although no decisions have been taken. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) Reyn related past concerns by the [ORG Dutch Parliament  ] regarding [ORG QDR  ] consultations , and asked that the [ORG USG  ] coordinate any [MISC QDR-related  ] consultation statements with the [MISC Dutch  ] prior to releasing them to the public . 
In this regard , he also expressed his appreciation for the opportunity to hold bilateral consultations on the [ORG QDR  ] in advance of the review 's completion . 
[PER Thomas  ] agreed to coordinate any statements about these or future consultations , and asked that the [MISC Dutch  ] do the same with the [ORG USG  ] . 
MFA Meeting: [MISC QDR Focus Areas  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) [PER Sandee  ] referred to an article in the [MISC Dutch  ] press in March 2005 regarding [LOC Washington  ] interest in consulting with Allies on this iteration of the [ORG QDR  ] ; as such , there is much interest in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
[PER Thomas  ] confirmed that was the purpose of his trip , and looked forward to any comments or constructive criticism so that [MISC Dutch  ] concerns might be better taken into account in [ORG QDR  ] development . 
He explained the [ORG QDR  ] timeline , noting the report 's anticipated release in February <a id='par2006' href='#par2006'>¶</a>2006. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( S ) [PER Thomas  ] commented on four [ORG QDR  ] focus areas . 
The first involved building partnerships to defeat terrorist extremism . 
The challenge underscored the importance of integrating multinational considerations into force planning . 
A second focus area is defending the homeland in-depth -- both internally by working with other Federal agencies , state and local governments , as well as by working with international partners globally as many potential problems cross borders ( [PER Avian Flu  ] , international terrorism ) . 
Shaping choices of countries at strategic crossroads is a third focus area . 
He described the fourth focus area as preventing hostile states or non-state actors from acquiring or using WMD . 
Our approach should have a preventive dimension along the lines of the [ORG Proliferation Security Initiative  ] ( [ORG PSI  ] ) . 
Think Globally , [MISC Act Locally  ] --------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( S ) [PER Thomas  ] reviewed several [ORG QDR  ] cross-cutting themes , including the balance between prevention and response . 
He emphasized the need to prevent states from failing -- instead of attempting to rebuild them after failure -- by maintaining and growing civil society . 
[PER Thomas  ] noted the importance of enabling both traditionally strong and crisis-bound partners , especially at the local level . 
He referred to the indirect strategy , noting that the [LOC United States  ] seeks to transform the character of the conflict with terrorist extremists by empowering moderates within the [MISC Islamic  ] world to confront and ostracize extremists . 
He stressed the need to build local institutions and training trainers , harnessing local knowledge , and adopting tailored , differentiated approaches that are culturally or regionally appropriate , i.e. , " " thinking globally but acting locally " " . <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( S ) [PER De Groot  ] described the shift in thinking as " " quite incredible , " " and suggested that the change will be difficult as different mind-sets are required to effectively carry out this " " soft power " " transition . 
He suggested that " " lessons learned " " be included in the [ORG QDR  ] process , especially regarding the military 's role in post-conflict and the transition from military operations to the international community reconstruction effort . 
[PER Gabrielse  ] pointed to the [MISC Dutch  ] MOD/development assistance " " integrated approach " " to security sector reform ( [ORG SSR  ] ) in [LOC Africa  ] . 
[PER Thomas  ] agreed on the importance of integrated approaches to security sector reform , stabilization and transition missions . 
He noted that [LOC U.S.  ] and allied militaries can help set the security conditions for nation building , but ultimately the success would depend on local leaders taking the responsibility to build or rebuild their own nations ; he recalled the President 's statement from his 2nd inaugural address that " " we stand with others when they stand for freedom . 
" " [ORG NATO  ] , [ORG UN  ] , [ORG EU  ] , and [ORG African Union  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( S ) [PER De Groot  ] asked if [ORG NATO  ] was capable of carrying out such an integrated approach to security sector reform , especially in connection to [LOC Africa  ] . 
[PER Thomas  ] said that [ORG NATO  ] probably has the capacity , as demonstrated by [ORG ISAF  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [MISC NTM-I  ] . 
But [MISC NTM-I  ] is a relatively modest effort -- [ORG NATO  ] can do more with training missions , he said . 
[PER Gabrielse  ] agreed , pointing to [ORG NATO  ] 's role in transforming the [MISC post-Soviet  ] [ORG Bloc  ] . 
[PER Thomas  ] noted the effectiveness of the [MISC Partnership for Peace  ] program , but cautioned against applying the [ORG Eastern European  ] model for security sector reform and particularly institutional reform at the expense of constructive field training. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( S ) [PER De Groot  ] noted that training for [ORG SSR  ] was different , involving advisors and small teams , not military units . 
Noting the difference in mind-sets , he asked if the [ORG USG  ] envisioned two separate battalions for fighting and post-conflict phases . 
[PER Thomas  ] said there should be no differentiation or specialization of general purpose forces -- ideally , military units in this capacity should be able to shift from conflict to stabilization and back to conflict phases , if necessary . 
They should also be trained to develop new skill sets and counter-insurgency techniques. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( S ) [PER De Groot  ] noted that better relations between [ORG NATO  ] , the [ORG UN  ] , and the [ORG African Union  ] ( [ORG AU  ] ) should be developed . 
[PER Thomas  ] agreed , adding that DoD welcomed the development of such regional security institutions . 
[PER Gabrielse  ] asked if the [ORG QDR  ] had examined [MISC NATO-EU  ] relations in connection to [ORG SSR  ] . 
[PER Thomas  ] explained that the [ORG QDR  ] had not focused much on the [ORG EU  ] , while observing that the [ORG EU  ] might be better suited to address some non-traditional security issues . 
[PER De Groot  ] and [PER Sandee  ] highlighted expertise being developed in the [ORG EU  ] with regard to civil-military coordination and suggested that the [ORG QDR  ] factor the [ORG EU  ] into the equation. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( U ) DASD [PER Thomas  ] has cleared on this cable .
