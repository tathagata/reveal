( [ORG SBU  ] ) In preparation for the November 2006 national elections in [LOC Nicaragua  ] , post has developed three " rap sheets " on the records of [PER Daniel Ortega  ] , the [MISC Sandinista  ] party ( [ORG FSLN  ] ) and [PER Arnoldo Aleman  ] , highlighting their systematic crimes and abuses . 
The rap sheets contain short summaries of the crimes and abuses committed , as well as details on the sources of the information . 
Post intends to use the information from these rap sheets in discussions with domestic and international interlocutors as a means of reminding [MISC Nicaraguan  ] voters and others of the true character of [PER Aleman  ] , [PER Ortega  ] , and the [MISC Sandinistas  ] . 
While the summaries themselves are unclassified , some of the sources of information are [ORG SBU  ] . 
Post will distribute the summaries to appropriate contacts , but not the sources . 
Post is sending both the summaries and the sources to the Department and other [LOC Washington  ] agencies for similar uses . 
This cable focuses on the crimes of [PER Daniel Ortega  ] and his family . 
Septels will cover the [ORG FSLN  ] and [PER Aleman  ] . 
CRIMES OF [PER DANIEL ORTEGA  ] AND HIS FAMILY - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - The Murder of [PER Jean-Paul Genie  ] by the bodyguards of [PER Humberto Ortega  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) In October 1990 , security guards working for [PER Humberto Ortega  ] , [PER Daniel  ] , s brother and the former [ORG FSLN  ] Army Commander , used automatic weapons to kill [PER Jean-Paul Genie  ] ( age 16 ) when [PER Genie  ] tried to pass [PER Humberto  ] , s convoy on what is now the [ORG Masaya Highway  ] . 
The [ORG FSLN  ] used its control of the judiciary and the police to cover up the crime , and no one was ever held accountable for [PER Genie  ] , s murder. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Sources: media accounts of the 1990 shooting of [PER Jean Paul Genie  ] , personal testimony by [PER Raymond Genie  ] ( the father of [PER Jean Paul  ] ) , legal documents filed by the [PER Genie  ] family in [LOC Nicaragua  ] and with the [ORG Inter-American Commission on Human Rights  ] ( [ORG IACHR  ] ) . 
Ordering of Torture , Killings , and Mass Murder - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) [PER Daniel  ] and [PER Humberto Ortega  ] participated in the [ORG FSLN  ] leadership council that collectively ordered the arrest and torture of thousands of people at prisons and prison camps all over [LOC Nicaragua  ] . 
The largest torture camp for political prisoners was in what is now the free trade zone near [LOC Managua  ] , s airport . 
The [PER Ortega  ] brothers and their [ORG FSLN  ] associates also ordered numerous murders and disappearances , including the killings of hundreds of [MISC Miskitos  ] on the [LOC Atlantic  ] coast and the internment of thousands more in concentration camps in 1981 and 1982. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Sources: thousands of complaints filed with the [MISC CPDH  ] human rights organization throughout the 1980s , testimony of [LOC Miskito  ] survivors and torture victims , annual [ORG State Department Human Rights  ] reports , documents on investigations carried out by the [ORG IACHR  ] during the 1980s . 
Rape and [ORG Sexual Abuse  ] of Step-daughter - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) In 1998 [PER Zoilamerica Narvaez  ] , the daughter of [PER Rosario Murillo  ] and the step-daughter of [PER Daniel Ortega  ] , made allegations that [PER Ortega  ] had raped and sexually abused her over a period of many years . 
However , [PER Ortega  ] used his immunity as a [ORG National Assembly  ] deputy and his control of the courts to ensure that the case never went to trial . 
Having ensured he would never face trial , [PER Ortega  ] then actively sabotaged all efforts by the [MISC Nicaraguan  ] government to provide justice to [PER Narvaez  ] and used his mother and [PER Rosario Murillo  ] in a public relations campaign intended to bury the allegations. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) Such misogynistic attitudes are common in the [ORG FSLN  ] , as is the tolerance of domestic and sexual violence . 
When [ORG FSLN National Assembly  ] deputies voted to lower the criminal penalties for statutory rape in March 2006 , [ORG FSLN  ] deputy [PER Nathan Sevilla  ] justified the vote by stating that sex with minors was " normal " in rural [LOC Nicaragua  ] and thus should not be considered a serious crime. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Sources: personal testimony of [LOC Zoilamerica  ] , legal documents filed by [PER Zoilamerica  ] in [MISC Nicaraguan  ] institutions ( including the courts , the police and the office of the [ORG Human Rights Ombudsman  ] ) and the [ORG IACHR  ] , media records of [PER Ortega  ] 's " public relations " campaign using [PER Rosario Murillo  ] and his own mother . 
Protection and Blackmail of Fellow Alleged Rapist [PER Ricardo Mayorga  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) In September 2004 , boxer [PER Ricardo Mayorga  ] allegedly raped a young woman in a [LOC Managua  ] hotel . 
Sensing an opportunity to blackmail [PER Mayorga  ] , [PER Ortega  ] and the [ORG FSLN  ] agreed to protect the boxer in the courts if he would give the party a large portion of his international boxing winnings and " advertise " for [PER Daniel  ] in public . 
[PER Mayorga  ] agreed , and an [ORG FSLN  ] judge found him not guilty in December . 
Much of [PER Mayorga  ] , s winnings now reportedly go to [PER Ortega  ] , and when [PER Mayorga  ] fought in [LOC Chicago  ] in August 2005 , he dedicated the fight to [PER Daniel  ] , wore the [ORG FSLN  ] colors , and flashed the number of the [ORG FSLN  ] slot on the [MISC Nicaraguan  ] electoral ballot ( " casilla " ) to the international media. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Sources: media accounts of [PER Mayorga  ] , s arrest , trial , his public " pro-Daniel " comments and his August 2005 fight , private testimony offered by lawyers involved in the case , testimony of the rape victim .

( U ) Property Confiscations: After the victory of the revolution in 1979 , [PER Daniel  ] immediately confiscated the [LOC Managua  ] residence of current [ORG National Assembly  ] deputy [PER Jaime Morales  ] . 
[PER Ortega  ] subsequently stole other houses and property surrounding the [PER Morales  ] residence and created his own private compound on an entire block in downtown [ORG Managua.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( U ) The [MISC Pinata Phenomenon:  ] After the [ORG FSLN  ] lost the election in 1990 but before it handed over power to [PER Dona Violeta  ] , [PER Ortega  ] supervised the theft of billions of dollars worth of land and state-owned companies that went to his immediate family , [PER Humberto Ortega  ] and other prominent [MISC Sandinistas  ] . 
Other companies involved in transportation , lumber , sugar mills , and slaughterhouses nominally went to the [ORG FSLN  ] , but effectively ended up in the hands of [PER Ortega  ] , his family , and their closest associates. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Sources: [MISC Nicaraguan  ] government property records document the [MISC Pinata  ] and the 1980s confiscations in great detail . 
[PER Ortega  ] still lives in the [PER Morales  ] house and occupies the entire block to this day . 
Testimony of those whose property was seized is also widely available and hundreds are registered with the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Embassy  ] . 
Other sources include [ORG State Department annual Human Rights Reports  ] and complaints filed with the [MISC CPDH  ] human rights organization . 
Cover-up of [PER Daniel  ] , s [ORG Son  ] , s Involvement in [ORG Fatal Car Accident  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( U ) On December 11 , 2005 , a vehicle owned by the [ORG FSLN  ] struck another vehicle and killed two young men in the early morning hours . 
Eyewitnesses reported that the person driving the [ORG FSLN  ] vehicle was [PER Rafael Ortega  ] , [PER Daniel  ] , s son and the director of [ORG FSLN-owned Channel  ] 4 , but , in order to protect the [PER Ortega  ] family , the [ORG FSLN  ] pulled a switch and claimed that another driver was behind the wheel . 
Police and Prosecutors , fearing [PER Ortega  ] , s power , refused to investigate the switch , denying justice to the families of the two victims using familiar [MISC Sandinista  ] cover-up methods. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Sources: media accounts of the accident and subsequent [MISC Sandinista  ] cover-up efforts ; the trial in which the [ORG FSLN  ] and its judges covered up the issue of the real driver is also a matter of public record . 
[PER Ortega  ] and Associates Suspected of Ordering Murder of [PER Carlos Guadamuz  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( U ) In February 2004 , [PER William Hurtado  ] , an [ORG FSLN  ] militant and former member of the [MISC Sandinista  ] state security apparatus , shot and killed journalist and radio personality [PER Carlos Guadamuz  ] in [LOC Managua  ] . 
A former [MISC Sandinista  ] himself , [PER Guadamuz  ] had broken with [PER Daniel Ortega  ] and used his radio program to criticize [PER Ortega  ] , &Nicho8 [PER Marenco  ] , and other [ORG FSLN  ] leaders on a wide range of issues , including [LOC Zoilamerica  ] , s rape allegations against [PER Ortega  ] . 
Although the involvement of [PER Daniel Ortega  ] and [PER Nicho Marenco  ] in the [PER Guadamuz  ] murder was never proven in court , the killing was carried out in classic [ORG FSLN  ] assassination-style and removed a thorn in the side of both men at a time when [PER Marenco  ] was running for Mayor of [ORG Managua.  ] <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Sources: The falling out between [PER Guadamuz  ] and the [ORG FSLN  ] and his media attacks on [PER Ortega  ] and [PER Marenco  ] are a matter of public record , as is [PER Guadamuz  ] , s complaint to the police that he believed the [ORG FSLN  ] planned to murder him . 
It is also a known fact that [PER Hurtado  ] was a former member of the [ORG Sandinista State Security Directorate  ] . 
Contacts with Terrorists - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( U ) [PER Daniel Ortega  ] has had close relations with numerous international terrorist groups for decades . 
During the 1980s , he invited international terrorists from [LOC Italy  ] , [LOC Lebanon  ] , [LOC Libya  ] , the [MISC Palestinian  ] territories , and [LOC Spain  ] to come to [LOC Nicaragua  ] to find safe haven and plan future terrorist operations . 
Many of these persons became [MISC Nicaraguan  ] citizens . 
Since losing power in 1990 , [PER Ortega  ] has continued to maintain his terrorist ties , and has publicly admitted receiving money from the government of [LOC Libya  ] and other dubious sources for his subsequent presidential campaigns. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( U ) In 1984 [PER Daniel Ortega  ] negotiated a deal with [MISC Colombian  ] drug kingpin [PER Pablo Escobar  ] whereby [PER Escobar  ] received refuge for several months in [LOC Nicaragua  ] after he had ordered the killing of the [MISC Colombian  ] Minister of Justice . 
At the same time , [PER Escobar  ] , s drug trafficking operation received [PER Ortega  ] , s approval to land and load airplanes in [LOC Nicaragua  ] as they sought to ship cocaine to the [LOC United States  ] . 
In return , [PER Ortega  ] and the [ORG FSLN  ] received large cash payments from [PER Escobar  ] . 
Interior Minister [PER Tomas Borge  ] and his subordinates went so far as to assist [PER Escobar  ] with the loading and unloading of drugs onto his airplanes in [LOC Nicaragua  ] . 
The [ORG Drug Enforcement Agency  ] ( [ORG DEA  ] ) managed to place a hidden camera on one of [PER Escobar  ] , s airplanes and obtained film of [PER Escobar  ] and Ministry of the Interior officials loading cocaine onto one of [PER Escobar  ] , s planes at [LOC Managua  ] , s international airport . 
[ORG CBS  ] news later broadcast the film and the entire story of [MISC Escobar-Ortega-FSLN  ] collaboration is related in detail in a 2005 book by [PER Astrid Legarda Martinez: El Verdadero Pablo: Sangre  ] , Traicion y Muerte ( [LOC Colombia  ] , [PER Ediciones Dipon  ] ) . <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( U ) [ORG FSLN  ] leaders , including [PER Humberto Ortega  ] , have admitted publicly that leaders of the [MISC Argentine  ] leftist terrorist group " [MISC Los Montoneros  ] " resided in [LOC Nicaragua  ] and engaged in military activities with the [ORG FSLN  ] for an extended period in 1979-1981 . 
[PER Humberto Ortega  ] admitted that [PER Fernando Vaca Narvaja  ] , the leader of the group , resided in his house in [ORG Managua.  ] <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Sources: [PER Ortega  ] has publicly admitted many of his terrorist connections , including the fact that he has received elections money from the government of [LOC Libya  ] . 
Many 1980s terrorists still live in [LOC Nicaragua  ] and have acquired [MISC Nicaraguan  ] citizenship ( including at least one prominent member of the [ORG Italian Red Brigades  ] ) , [PER Ortega  ] publicly associated with many of these individuals in [LOC Nicaragua  ] throughout the 1980s . 
The [PER Pablo Escobar  ] footage was filmed June 24 , 1984 .
