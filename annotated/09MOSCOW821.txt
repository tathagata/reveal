[ORG REF: MOSCOW  ] 03242 2008 Classified By: EconMinCouns [PER Eric T. Schultz  ] , Reasons 1.4 ( b , d ) ------- SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Leading [MISC Russian  ] sociologists concur the [ORG GOR  ] missed the chance to invest in the middle class during the economic boom . 
As a result , the middle class remains only approximately 20 percent of the population . 
That said , experts assert that the small middle class is nonetheless well positioned to weather the current crisis owing to its savings and human capital . 
Moreover , they see the middle class less as a revolutionary class than an inert mass , inclined to support the administration . 
Neither sociologists nor the administration consider the middle class a threat to the regime , even in the throes of an economic downturn . 
As such , the government has decided to focus its anti-crisis resources on blue-collar workers instead of providing the support and institutional reform needed for middle class development -- and ultimately the innovation economy that [PER Medvedev  ] and [PER Putin  ] advocate . 
End Summary. ---------------------------------------- MIDDLE CLASS SURVIVING , BUT NOT THRIVING ---------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) During last month 's annual conference on the sociopolitical challenges of the 21st century , sponsored by the [ORG Independent Institute for Social Politics  ] ( [ORG ISP  ] ) , panels of sociologists and economists , many of whom advise President [PER Medvedev  ] , said the [MISC Russian  ] middle class would survive the economic crisis but would not thrive . 
[PER Igor Yurgens  ] , of the [ORG Institute for Modern Development  ] , opened the conference by underscoring the [ORG GOR  ] 's neglect of investment in the public and social institutions necessary to nurture the middle class during the eight year economic boom that coincided with Prime Minister [PER Putin  ] 's presidency . 
The opportunities provided by massive petrodollar inflows were now gone , he stated . 
Owing to the government 's failure to capitalize on these opportunities and the reversal in [LOC Russia  ] 's economic fortunes , the vertical impetus for social mobility had stopped functioning. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , further stressed the lack of quantitative middle class growth in spite of [LOC Russia  ] 's economic prosperity . 
She used studies from 2000 and 2007 to demonstrate that the size of the middle class remained relatively constant , at anywhere from 12 to 20 percent of the population . 
By her estimate , the core of the middle class was between 5-7 percent of the population , although by lowering the income standards and the standard set for social and professional status , the middle class would then range between 12-20 percent of the population . 
In her calculations , the middle class was made up primarily of managers of large companies , bank directors , financial specialists , business owners ( restaurants , retail trade ) , part of the intelligentsia , and middle to high-level bureaucrats . 
The latter category had grown during the crisis ( owing to the slowdown in the private sector ) , and she said , now comprised about a quarter of the middle class. --------------------------- GETTING THROUGH THE CRISIS --------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) During a separate meeting with us , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] claimed that the fall in real incomes , not job losses , was now the biggest threat to middle class prosperity . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] estimated that middle class incomes would shrink this year by 10 to 15 percent with a negative GDP growth rate of 3.5 percent . 
( In comparison middle class incomes dropped by 25 percent during the 1998 crisis ) . 
She added that the " core " of the middle class had actually contracted slightly , from 6.9 to 5.3 percent , which she said was probably due to the fact that a number of white collar workers ( bankers , managers , as well as small and medium sized entrepreneurs ) had fallen out of the middle class since the beginning of the crisis . 
She contended , however , that the employment situation with the middle class had for the most part stabilized. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] commented that the middle class had certain " cushions " which gave it an advantage over the blue collar , or poorer classes during the crisis . 
First of all , many of the middle class had accumulated [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00000821 002 OF 003 savings during the boom years ( comprising between seven to 10 percent of their total incomes , or the equivalent of four or five monthly salaries ) . 
Between October 2008 and February 2009 , they tended to take advantage of the [ORG GOR  ] 's gradual devaluation to purchase foreign exchange , trade it for rubles , and then purchase large consumer items and durables , such as automobiles and refrigerators , which were priced in rubles . 
She said as of February , however , the middle class " consumer binge " had pretty much run its course owing to the decline in real incomes , depletion of personal savings , and persistent inflation. ----------------- NOT REVOLUTIONARY ----------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Despite claims by political activists like [PER Garry Kasparov  ] that the middle class will create " problems " for the administration when job cuts start and salaries freeze , most sociologists here portray the middle class as a conservative force rather than a potentially disgruntled constituency eager to defend its interests . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] argued the number of " entrepreneurs " within the middle class had not grown during the [PER Putin  ] years . 
He claimed virtually all of the growth had come instead from the rise of government bureaucrats who benefited from impressive pay increases under [PER Putin  ] . 
As a result , the mentality of the middle class has shifted considerably away from the more independent and market-oriented conceptions of the [MISC Yeltsin-era  ] ( in which entrepreneurial types dominated ) . <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) During the [PER Putin  ] era , [LOC Russia  ] has developed what [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] termed a " third world " middle class with a conservative mentality , shaped by hierarchical thinking , and largely risk averse . 
Indeed , according to his research , the core of the middle class has now absorbed much of the bureaucratic worldview of the majority . 
This explains the broad support for [PER Putin  ] and [PER Medvedev  ] across society , the power of social conservative values , and a reluctance to challenge authority. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Paradoxically , [LOC Russia  ] 's youthful middle class is more [MISC Western  ] in its lifestyle , but still very anti-Western in its politics , according to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
She sees [LOC Russia  ] 's young " social innovators " ( her company eschews the term " middle class " as too controversial ) as characterized by a more [MISC Western  ] lifestyle , including the willingness to take bank loans , use the internet , pay for fitness centers , etc . 
Their better education makes them mentally more flexible but does not make them more politically liberal . 
Far from afraid of the economic downturn , most are confident that their abilities allow them to re-invent themselves and adapt to challenges. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] commented to us that today 's youth are firmly indoctrinated in a " patriotic " mindset that blames the [LOC US  ] and the [LOC West  ] for much of [LOC Russia  ] 's ills . 
They remain largely apolitical , but more attuned to the interests of the state , rather than the rights and opportunities of the individual . 
As such , he sees [LOC Russia  ] 's youth as more inclined to rally in defense of the state than to agitate for revolutionary change. --------------------------------------------- -- MIDDLE CLASS WELL POSITIONED , BUT LACKS SUPPORT --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) That said , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us in separate meetings that the middle class still had the best chance of stimulating [LOC Russia  ] 's development in the post-crisis world . 
It had invested more in its own human capital ( education and training ) during the high growth years ; whereas the lower socio-economic strata used most of their new-found cash to purchase basic consumer items . 
In addition , the middle class had acquired work experience and professional skills enabling them to adapt to shifts in labor market demand . 
Blue-collar households , in contrast , were suffering disproportionately from inflation , down-sizing , and salary reductions . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] concluded the middle class would be the best candidate for supporting collaboration between the state , society , and private sector to address [LOC Russia  ] 's economic problems. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) However , these analysts pointed out that the [ORG GOR  ] 's focus on blue-collar workers in its anti-crisis measures had [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00000821 003 OF 003 deprived the middle class of resources and opportunities to stimulate growth or reform . 
According to [PER Tambovtsev  ] , the main hope for middle class to play a transitional role in society lay in small business entrepreneurship . 
Unfortunately , the absence of secure property and contract rights , a biased judiciary , and administrative barriers impeded [ORG SME  ] growth . 
Falling consumption was also hurting [ORG SME  ] 's , which tended to orient themselves toward household consumers . 
Without the resources and institutional reforms necessary to improve their productivity , middle class entrepreneurs were unlikely to serve as a strong countermeasure to current economic trends. ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) While not dead , the [MISC Russian  ] middle class does not show signs of rapid growth in the near term , nor does it seem likely to be the engine of democratic change in [LOC Russia  ] . 
Better equipped to deal with the downturn than the working classes but politically inert , the middle class poses little threat to political and social stability . 
Moreover , despite the administration 's emphasis on preparing for post-crisis development through innovation and small/medium businesses , the most likely candidate to help the government achieve those aims -- the middle class -- has largely been ignored by the state . 
We expect this process to continue: budget constraints will leave minimal resources for cultivating the human capital of the middle class .
