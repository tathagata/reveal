( C ) SUMMARY . 
On January 14 , Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] hosted the [ORG Chiefs of the  ] three [MISC Brazilian  ] Services , [PER Gen. Enzo Peri  ] , [ORG ADM Julio Soares  ] de [PER Moura Neto  ] and Brig. [PER Juniti Saito  ] for a discussion of the [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] defense relationship and possibilities for future cooperation . 
Each of the [ORG Chiefs  ] said cooperation with their counterpart [LOC U.S.  ] service was excellent and gave his priorities for upcoming cooperation . 
Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] highlighted opportunities for defense industrial cooperation citing [ORG Boeing  ] 's efforts to find partners for the FX2 program as a model . 
The three stressed the need for better transparency of [LOC U.S.  ] export licensing , with [PER Saito  ] saying that the perception in [LOC Brazil  ] that slow licensing times reflect a [ORG State Department  ] policy aimed at restricting [LOC Brazil  ] 's access to military technology was creating " problems at the political level , " a veiled reference to high level resistance to the purchase of [MISC Boeing Super  ] Hornet fighters . 
The [ORG Chiefs  ] all cited the new Defense Strategy as an important step forward as it gave the issue of national security greater prominence in the national political scene . 
They were less positive on whether there would be resources available to carry out the ambitious strategy but felt the document would allow for a stronger case for resources to be directed to defense . 
Regarding future cooperation , [PER Moura Neto  ] underlined the importance of in country construction of major projects , e.g. ships . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) At a January 14 lunch , Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] invited the service Chiefs to discuss [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] security cooperation , in particular , their views on areas for enhancing the relationship . 
All three began by saying that they enjoyed close and productive relationships with their counterpart [LOC U.S.  ] services . 
Admiral [PER Moura Neto  ] cited personnel exchanges as a success for the navy and hoped to expand such exchanges , if approved , to include the [ORG U.S. Coast Guard  ] ( the [MISC Brazilian  ] navy performs the coast guard mission ) as well . 
[PER Brigadeiro Saito  ] stated that while the overall relationship was strong with the [LOC U.S.  ] as [LOC Brazil  ] 's most important supplier , there was room for improvement in the processing of export licenses by the [ORG State Department  ] . 
General [PER Enzo  ] mentioned exchanges of army engineers as a fruitful area for cooperation . 
FUTURE EQUIPMENT - TO BE MADE IN [LOC BRAZIL  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) All three chiefs underlined the growing emphasis the [MISC Brazilian  ] government is placing on developing [MISC Brazilian  ] industry . 
[PER Moura Neto  ] said the Navy 's highest priority was coastal patrol craft , to be followed by a new generation of frigates ( " escort ships " ) , but the government would only authorize acquisition of such ships if they were to be built in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
( NOTE: He did not mention the politically popular submarine program as a priority . 
End note . 
) The other Chiefs had similar views . 
[PER Enzo  ] noted that [LOC Brazil  ] was seeking to be able to perform maintenance of [LOC Black Hawk  ] helicopters in country , rather than in the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Saito  ] and [PER Moura Neto  ] agreed that future aircraft procurement for the navy and air force would depend on building aircraft in country . 
Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] cited [ORG AVIBRAS  ] , whom he met with recently ( ref e ) , as a company intent on exploiting the potential for greater cooperation between [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Brazilian  ] defense industries . 
CHALLENGES - IT'S ALL THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S FAULT --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The service chiefs each weighed in on what they perceive as the major problem with the [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] security relationship -- [ORG State Department  ] export licensing . 
Each service has examples of cases in which delays in the licensing process have caused difficulties for the [MISC Brazilians  ] . 
Examples include gyroscopes for the air force , [LOC Black Hawk  ] parts for the army and a radar antenna . 
( Note: While these problems have most typically been due to exporter error , the common denominator has been [ORG State Department  ] licensing . 
End note . 
) [PER Saito  ] said that he believes our [ORG BRASILIA  ] 00000073 002 OF 002 system is " run by bureaucrats , " adding that State policies are based on an unwarranted view that [LOC Brazil  ] cannot be trusted to protect sensitive technologies . 
[PER Enzo  ] emphatically stated that he believes State 's actions to limit exports reflect the lack of a " policy of state " in favor of advancing the defense partnership with [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] pointed out that data indicate no worse a rate of denial and [LOC RWA  ] for [LOC Brazil  ] than most other major importers of [ORG ITAR  ] controlled items and noted that the recently convened [ORG Technology Security Dialogue  ] can help remove misunderstandings . 
With a clear view toward the FX2 decision , [PER Saito  ] warned that the perceived [ORG State Department  ] opposition to technology transfer to [LOC Brazil  ] was creating " problems at a political level . 
" DEFENSE STRATEGY - POSITIVE FOR THE MILITARY --------------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Responding to a question of how the ambitious plans for military modernization would be resourced , [PER Moura Neto  ] stated that while this was an economic ( as opposed to military ) question , the advantage of the strategy document ( see ref a for discussion ) was that it made the question of defense resources a national one . 
By recognizing [LOC Brazil  ] 's " strategic vulnerabilities , " the strategy had put the question of defense in the forefront of the national debate . 
[PER Enzo  ] added that this would be a much more positive development for the military as it put them " inside " of national development instead of on the sidelines where they have been since the end of military rule . 
While the strategy document contains many demands on limited resources , including equipment , support to inefficient industries and training for national service , the military views it as positive because it signifies a greater understanding of the importance of the military . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The warning from [PER Saito  ] , whom post considers a key ally in our FX2 bid , is the clearest indication yet that the obstacles to the [MISC F18  ] sale cited in refs c and d are real and that we still have considerable ground to cover in countering the perception that the [ORG USG  ] , and the [ORG State Department  ] in particular , cannot be counted on to approve the necessary technology transfer . 
The service chiefs got the point that the offer of the [MISC F18  ] signified an unprecedented willingness to approve technology for [LOC Brazil  ] that would pay dividends in both military and defense industry cooperation in the future , but the political problem cited by [PER Saito  ] remains acute .
