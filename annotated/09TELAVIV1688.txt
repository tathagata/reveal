( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: Assistant Secretary for [ORG Political-Military Affairs  ] [PER Andrew Shapiro  ] met with a number of [ORG GOI  ] officials on July 22-23 to stress the importance of the [MISC U.S.-Israeli  ] political-military relationship , and to discuss among other issues [LOC Israel  ] 's [ORG Qualitative Military Edge  ] ( [ORG QME  ] ) . 
[ORG GOI  ] interlocutors continued to press for the opportunity to review the [ORG QME  ] report prior to its submission to [ORG Congress  ] , and presented an official response to a [LOC U.S.  ] non-paper on potential arms transfers to [MISC Arab  ] countries . 
In that respect , the [ORG MOD  ] proposed technical discussions in [LOC Washington  ] on August 3 to further discuss [ORG GOI  ] concerns over the potential [MISC F-15SA  ] transfer to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
[ORG GOI  ] officials continued to express reservations regarding [LOC U.S.  ] arms transfers to [LOC Lebanon  ] , and requested the opportunity to further discuss [LOC U.S.  ] strategy and intentions with respect to the [ORG Lebanese Armed Forces  ] . 
[ORG GOI  ] interlocutors raised continued concerns over the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear weapons program , noting that any policy of engagement be done in conjunction with tougher sanctions and for a finite period of time before turning to other " options on the table . 
" Other issues raised by [ORG GOI  ] officials included the [ORG Peace Process , Israel  ] 's export control system , and potential [MISC Israeli  ] exports to [LOC China  ] . 
Both sides agreed in principle to the next session of the [ORG Joint Political Military Group  ] ( [ORG JPMG  ] ) in October or early November in [LOC Israel  ] . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On July 22 , [PER A/S Shapiro  ] met with [ORG MOD  ] Director General [PER Pinchas Buchris  ] , [ORG MOD  ] Political-Military Director [PER Amos Gilad  ] , [ORG Defense Export Control Directorate  ] Chief [PER Eli Pincu  ] , and participated in a roundtable discussion led by [ORG J5 Strategic Division  ] Chief Brigadier General [PER Yossi Heymann  ] . 
At the [ORG MFA  ] on July 23 , [PER A/S Shapiro  ] met with Director General [PER Yossi Gal  ] and participated in a roundtable discussion led by Deputy Director General for [ORG Strategic Affairs Alon Bar and Export Control  ] Director [PER Roey Gilad  ] . 
[PER A/S Shapiro  ] also participated in a strategic tour of [LOC Israel  ] , and visited [MISC Israeli  ] defense company [ORG Plasan-Sasa  ] . 
[MISC U.S.-Israeli  ] Relationship ------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER A/S Shapiro  ] stressed the importance of the [MISC U.S-Israeli  ] political-military relationship , noting the significance of visiting [LOC Israel  ] on his first overseas trip in his capacity as Assistant Secretary for the [ORG Political-Military Affairs Bureau  ] . 
[ORG GOI  ] interlocutors appreciated the opportunity to resume dialogue on this important aspect of the [MISC U.S.-Israeli  ] relationship . 
[ORG MOD  ] DG [PER Buchris  ] noted the two still relatively new administrations in the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Israel  ] , and the importance of limiting the number of misunderstandings in the future . 
[ORG Qualitative Military Edge  ] ------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG GOI  ] officials reiterated the importance of maintaining [LOC Israel  ] 's [ORG Qualitative Military Edge  ] ( [ORG QME  ] ) . 
They said that [LOC Israel  ] understands [LOC U.S.  ] policy intentions to arm moderate [MISC Arab  ] states in the region to counter the [MISC Iranian  ] threat , and prefers such sales originate from the [LOC United States  ] instead of other countries like [LOC Russia  ] or [LOC China  ] . 
However , [LOC Israel  ] continues to stress the importance of identifying potential risks that may become future threats or adversaries , and for this reason maintains several objections as indicated in the official [ORG GOI  ] response to the [ORG QME  ] non-paper on potential [LOC U.S.  ] arms sales to the region ( ref e-mail to PM/RSAT separately ) . <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG GOI  ] officials also expressed continued interest in reviewing the [ORG QME  ] report prior to its submission to [ORG Congress  ] . 
[PER A/S Shapiro  ] reiterated that the report was based on an assessment from the intelligence community , and therefore not releasable to the [ORG GOI  ] . 
He referenced previous points made to the [MISC Israeli  ] embassy in [LOC Washington  ] regarding the report , and welcomed any comments the [ORG GOI  ] might have -- although such comments should be delivered as soon as possible as the report is already overdue . 
[MISC Israeli  ] interlocutors appreciated the classified nature of the report , but also made clear it was difficult to comment on the report 's results without reviewing its content or intelligence assessment . 
In that respect , [PER Buchris  ] and other [ORG GOI  ] officials requested that the [ORG QME  ] process be reviewed in light of future [ORG QME  ] reports. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG GOI  ] interlocutors attempted to make the argument that moderate [MISC Arab  ] countries could in the future become adversaries -- and that this should be taken into account in the [ORG QME  ] process . 
During a roundtable discussion led by the [ORG MFA  ] 's Deputy Director General for [ORG Strategic Affairs Alon Bar  ] , the [ORG MFA  ] 's [ORG Center for Policy Research  ] gave intelligence briefs on [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] , and [LOC Lebanon  ] to further support the argument that these countries could become future foes . 
[ORG Policy Research Center  ] interlocutors reviewed succession concerns in both [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] and [LOC Egypt  ] . 
[ORG Bar  ] argued that a perceived closure in the capability gap between [LOC Israel  ] and [MISC Arab  ] states , coupled with a nuclear-armed [LOC Iran  ] , could compel moderate [MISC Arab  ] states to reassess the notion that [LOC Israel  ] was a fixture in the region. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Typically frank , [ORG MOD  ] Political-Military Chief [PER Amos Gilad  ] was not certain how much longer [MISC Egyptian  ] President [PER Mubarak  ] would live , and questioned whether his son [PER Gamal  ] was ready to assume command . 
[PER Gilad  ] said the [MISC Egyptian  ] military led by [ORG Defense Minister  ] [PER Tantawi  ] continues to train and exercise as if " [LOC Israel  ] was its only enemy . 
" He added that there were disturbing signs on the [MISC Egyptian  ] streets , as women are dressed more conservatively , and that peace with [LOC Israel  ] " is too thin , too superficial . 
" On [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , [PER Gilad  ] said that King [PER Abdullah  ] does not hate [LOC Israel  ] , but his chief priority is the survival of the regime. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG GOI  ] official response to the arms transfer non-paper includes several objections , such as the potential transfer of systems for the [MISC F-15SA  ] to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , including the [MISC Enhanced Paveway II  ] , [ORG Joint Helmet  ] Mounted [PER Cueing System  ] , and [ORG AESA  ] radar . 
[PER Buchris  ] said the [ORG GOI  ] is ready to establish a working group to discuss the [MISC F-15SA  ] transfer , and proposed an [MISC Israeli  ] technical team accompany BG [PER Heymann  ] to [LOC Washington  ] ( in town for a missile defense meeting ) on August 3 to discuss the issue further . 
[PER Buchris  ] said the sale of the [MISC F-15SA  ] was not the problem , but rather the weapons systems included on the planes and the location of the planes in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
[LOC Lebanon  ] ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG GOI  ] remains concerned about [LOC U.S.  ] arms transfers to the [ORG Lebanese Armed Forces  ] ( [ORG LAF  ] ) , and has requested the opportunity to discuss further [LOC U.S.  ] intentions regarding the [ORG LAF  ] . 
[PER A/S Shapiro  ] said the results of the [MISC Lebanese  ] elections represented a turning point , and rejection of [ORG Hizballah  ] and its [MISC Iranian  ] sponsors . 
The need to build up [MISC Lebanese  ] institutions , including the army , was now more important than ever , he argued . 
[PER A/S Shapiro  ] said the [ORG LAF  ] has thus far demonstrated a solid record of accounting for [LOC U.S.  ] systems transferred to [LOC Lebanon.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Buchris  ] acknowledged that the elections in [LOC Lebanon  ] were positive , but countered that [ORG Hizballah  ] 's influence remains strong . 
He argued that items such as the [ORG Cessna Caravan  ] and the [PER Raven  ] unmanned aerial vehicle ( [ORG UAV  ] ) lack sufficient mitigation measures , which creates the potential for an incident along the [MISC Israel-Lebanese  ] border . 
[PER Amos Gilad  ] said the [ORG GOI  ] does not believe the [ORG LAF  ] will attack [LOC Israel  ] . 
However , given the ties between [ORG Hizballah  ] and the [ORG LAF  ] , he was certain the [ORG IDF  ] would eventually face the [ORG LAF  ] in any conflict with [ORG Hizballah.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Analysts from the [ORG MFA  ] 's [ORG Center for Policy Research  ] argued there has been no dramatic change in the political arena despite the March 14 coalition 's significant victory in the elections . 
They said the fragile political situation in [LOC Lebanon  ] is currently stable , but [ORG Hizballah  ] still possesses an unofficial veto over policy . 
Long term prospects will be tested by the [ORG Hariri Tribunal  ] and [ORG Hizballah  ] 's desire for a reprisal to the 2008 [MISC Mughniyeh  ] assassination . 
[ORG MFA Policy Research  ] analysts further argued that the [ORG LAF  ] faces tremendous pressure following the recent explosion of a [ORG Hizballah  ] arms cache near the [MISC Lebanese-Israeli  ] border . 
[ORG MFA DG Yossi Gal  ] noted that [ORG UNIFIL  ] had been prevented from investigating the explosion , and raised the recent crossing by [MISC Lebanese  ] citizens into [MISC Israeli  ] territory to plant [MISC Lebanese  ] and [ORG Hizballah  ] flags . 
He said [MISC French  ] and [MISC Italian  ] delegations had praised the [ORG GOI  ] 's restraint in these cases. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER A/S Shapiro  ] asked if the election results might be the result in part of a backlash in the [MISC Christian  ] community against [ORG Hizballah  ] ; the [ORG Policy Research  ] analysts countered that the results were indicative of several factors , including the influx of [MISC Saudi  ] money and an unstable opposition camp . 
They agreed that [ORG Hizballah  ] leader [PER Nasrallah  ] might be a bit chastened following the elections , as suggested by [PER A/S Shapiro  ] , but that [ORG Hizballah  ] continues to try and undermine the March 14 coalition. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) During the [ORG MOD  ] roundtable discussion , BG [PER Heymann  ] also acknowledged the positive results of the elections . 
However , he feared the outcome did not represent the real power of the [LOC Shi'ites  ] in [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
He agreed that moderates and the [ORG LAF  ] must be strengthened , but expressed deep concerns about ongoing cooperation between [ORG Hizballah  ] and the [ORG LAF  ] . 
He also said that such aid to [LOC Lebanon  ] be paired with efforts to halt smuggling and directly weaken [ORG Hizballah.  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) BG [PER Heymann  ] also cited concerns regarding mitigation measures for the Caravan and [PER Raven  ] in order to prevent an " accidental engagement " by the [ORG IAF  ] . 
Overall , he was skeptical that these systems would benefit the [ORG LAF  ] , and said the [ORG GOI  ] would appreciate a more in-depth conversation regarding [LOC U.S.  ] intentions and overarching strategy with respect to the [ORG LAF  ] . 
[PER Heymann  ] suggested further talks to coincide with the August 3rd [MISC F-15  ] technical discussion in [LOC Washington  ] ; [ORG MFA DDG Bar  ] echoed this request . 
[PER A/S Shapiro  ] offered to take that back to [LOC Washington  ] for review . 
If it proved too difficult on short notice to bring together interagency experts to discuss [LOC US  ] intentions with the [ORG LAF  ] , [PER A/S Shapiro  ] suggested it be included in the [ORG Joint Political Military Group  ] talks later in the fall . 
[LOC Iran  ] ---- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [LOC Iran  ] 's pursuit of nuclear weapons remains the [ORG GOI  ] 's primary focus . 
[PER Buchris  ] stated bluntly that it was not clear to him where [LOC U.S.  ] policy was heading with regard to [LOC Iran  ] . 
In separate meetings , [PER Buchris  ] and [PER Amos Gilad  ] said that [LOC Israel  ] 's preeminent priority is to prevent [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear weapons program , which if realized would cause a nuclear arms race across the [LOC Middle East  ] as [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] and [LOC Egypt  ] pursue similar programs in response . 
[PER Gilad  ] was skeptical that engagement would work , noting [MISC Iranian  ] desires to " establish a new empire " and pointing to [MISC Iranian  ] support for [ORG Hizballah  ] and " Hamastan . 
" [PER Buchris  ] added that the United [MISC States'  ] desire to engage with [LOC Iran  ] should be accompanied by tough sanctions , and only pursued for a finite period of time ; [ORG MFA DG Gal  ] concurred . 
Alluding to a potential military strike , [PER Buchris  ] said " all options must remain on the table , " and acknowledged that part of his job was insuring [LOC Israel  ] was ready to employ such an option , no matter how undesirable it may be. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER A/S Shapiro  ] made clear that a nuclear armed [LOC Iran  ] was unacceptable to the [LOC United States  ] . 
He referenced Secretary [PER Clinton  ] 's July 15 foreign policy address at the [ORG Council on Foreign Relations  ] , noting the offer of engagement with [LOC Iran  ] -- but reinforcing that such an offer is not indefinite . 
[PER A/S Shapiro  ] argued that an [MISC Iranian  ] rejection of our offer to engage will only help bolster international support for increased sanctions . 
He also pointed to the uncertain situation following the [MISC Iranian  ] elections -- it was unclear at this point how the regime in [LOC Tehran  ] will react to our offer of engagement . 
That said , he repeated that the engagement offer was not unlimited , noting that the [LOC United States  ] will reassess its engagement strategy with [LOC Iran  ] later this fall. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER A/S Shapiro  ] cited a commonality of interests with the [LOC Gulf States  ] , which also view [LOC Iran  ] as the preeminent threat -- we should take advantage of this commonality , he said . 
During the J5 roundtable discussion , [ORG IDF  ] interlocutors expressed skepticism that proposed military assistance to the [LOC Gulf  ] would help against [LOC Iran  ] , as some of the systems slated for delivery are not designed to counter the threats , nuclear and asymmetrical , posed by [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER A/S Shapiro  ] agreed that assistance to [LOC Gulf  ] states should not diminish [LOC Israel  ] 's [ORG QME  ] , but argued that it sends a signal to those countries ( as well as [LOC Iran  ] ) that they have strong allies in the [LOC West  ] . 
It also helps convince these regimes that their best interests lie with the moderate camp rather than with [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Buchris  ] said the lack of an appointed [LOC U.S.  ] special envoy focusing on [LOC Iran  ] suggested the [LOC United States  ] did not believe [LOC Iran  ] was a priority . 
[PER A/S Shapiro  ] reassured [PER Buchris  ] that [LOC Iran  ] was a top priority as President [PER Obama  ] and Secretary [PER Clinton  ] are intensely focused on [LOC Iran  ] . 
The fact that [LOC Tehran  ] has not responded to our offer of engagement makes a special envoy responsible for negotiations not as important , [PER A/S Shapiro  ] said -- in any case , much of the discussion will be behind the scenes. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Buchris  ] referenced a press report from Secretary [PER Clinton  ] 's trip to [LOC Jakarta  ] in which she said the [LOC United States  ] would consider providing a defense umbrella for moderate [MISC Arab  ] countries in the [LOC Middle East  ] should [LOC Iran  ] acquire a nuclear weapon . 
[PER Buchris  ] argued that such a statement already conceded the idea of a nuclear-armed [LOC Iran  ] . 
[ORG MFA Deputy Director General for Strategic Affairs Alon Bar  ] also raised the Secretary 's [LOC Jakarta  ] statement ; [PER A/S Shapiro  ] stated that the Secretary 's comments did not indicate a new policy approach , but were meant as a deterrent factor toward [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear weapons ambitions -- not as a concession -- and that journalists covering the trip attempted to make more out of the statement than was intended. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Amos Gilad  ] referenced [LOC Russia  ] 's potential sale of the [MISC S-300  ] missile system to [LOC Iran  ] , noting that [MISC Russian  ] interlocutors initially denied the [MISC S-300  ] contract with [LOC Iran  ] , and then later admitted it had been signed but added that the system would not be delivered for political reasons . 
However , [PER Gilad  ] said the [MISC Russians  ] would reassess this political calculation should the [LOC United States  ] continue to pursue missile defense plans in [LOC Poland  ] and the [LOC Czech Republic  ] . 
He speculated that the [MISC Iranians  ] would continue to put pressure on [LOC Russia  ] to sell the system rather than pursue alternative [MISC Chinese  ] systems . 
He said the [MISC Russians  ] appear committed to preventing [LOC Iran  ] from acquiring nuclear weapons , but he personally had doubts about their intelligence capabilities following their lack of knowledge regarding the [MISC Syrian  ] nuclear project . 
Peace Process ------------- <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Buchris  ] acknowledged that the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] was doing a " good job " in the [LOC West Bank  ] , noting respect for [ORG Palestinian Security Forces  ] ( [ORG PASF  ] ) as they take more control of security -- giving them the chance to succeed was important , [PER Buchris  ] said . 
He also commended the work of [LOC United States  ] Security Coordinator [PER Gen. Dayton  ] in training the [ORG PASF  ] . 
That said , [PER Buchris  ] argued the way ahead would be difficult , given the divide between [ORG Hamas  ] and [PER Fatah  ] . 
Reconciliation talks between the two have stalled -- [PER Amos Gilad  ] said both sides are " more interested in swallowing one another " than negotiating . 
Behind the scenes discussions with [ORG Hamas  ] by [MISC European  ] countries and even [LOC U.S.  ] visitors have not helped the situation , [PER Buchris  ] said . 
[PER A/S Shapiro  ] deferred to Special Envoy Sen. [PER George Mitchell  ] 's efforts , but noted Secretary [PER Clinton  ] 's point that a stronger [LOC PA  ] will offer an alternative to [ORG Hamas  ] . 
He also stressed Secretary [PER Clinton  ] 's remarks during her July 15 speech that the [LOC United States  ] will not engage with [ORG Hamas  ] unless it has accepted the Quartet principles . 
[ORG Export Control  ] -------------- <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) [ORG MOD Defense Export Control Directorate  ] ( [ORG DECD  ] ) Chief [PER Eli Pincu  ] reviewed the export control system , emphasizing an improved process , but also acknowledging the potential for improvement . 
He gave a brief presentation regarding [MISC Israeli  ] export controls , including enhanced legislation , cross-ministry coordination , enhanced enforcement , and increased industry outreach and training . 
He noted 780 registered exporters in [LOC Israel  ] ; for 2009 , 31,373 marketing licenses had thus far been issued , with 1,198 denials and 219 returned without action . 
[ORG MFA Export Control  ] Director [PER Roey Gilad  ] stressed the partnership between the [ORG MOD  ] and [ORG MFA  ] on export licenses , and explained the system 's dispute resolution mechanism in the event the [ORG MFA  ] and [ORG MOD  ] disagree on a particular case. <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( C ) Both [PER Pincu  ] and [PER Roey Gilad  ] noted that the [ORG GOI  ] continues to seek assistance in closing export control loopholes , including brokering . 
[PER Pincu  ] noted that brokering had been included in the [ORG Defense Export Control Act  ] , but that accompanying implementation legislation had not yet entered in to force . 
[PER Pincu  ] said the [ORG GOI  ] had consulted with [LOC Germany  ] , the [LOC United Kingdom  ] , [LOC France  ] , and [LOC Japan  ] on its brokering laws , and planned to raise it during the annual defense export control working group to be held in [LOC Washington  ] in October . 
[PER Roey Gilad  ] and other [ORG DECD  ] officials also hope to travel to [LOC Washington  ] in the near future to further discuss brokering issues . 
[LOC China  ] ----- <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( C ) [ORG MFA Export Control  ] Director [PER Roey Gilad  ] reiterated that the [ORG GOI  ] in no way desires to compromise [LOC U.S.  ] national interests with respect to exports to [LOC China  ] . 
He noted , however , that the [ORG U.S. Department of Commerce  ] created in 2007 a list of exemptions for certain items if sent to validated end users in [LOC China  ] . 
[PER Gilad  ] questioned whether the same exemptions might be possible for [LOC Israel  ] . 
As it currently stands , the [ORG GOI  ] must pursue any export to [LOC China  ] through the bilateral statement of understanding with the [LOC United States  ] . 
While the statement calls for expeditious resolution of any requests to export to [LOC China  ] , it often takes up to 80 days to obtain approval . 
By that time , [PER Gilad  ] said , [LOC China  ] has often found the item through another supplier . 
Moreover , the [MISC Israeli  ] export control system requires a 20-working day turn-around on all export license requests -- which is not possible , given the length of time required to obtain an answer from the [LOC United States  ] . 
[PER A/S Shapiro  ] offered to raise the issue in [LOC Washington  ] . 
[ORG JPMG  ] ---- <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER A/S Shapiro  ] suggested the next session of the [ORG Joint Political Military Group  ] ( [ORG JPMG  ] ) convene shortly after the [MISC Jewish  ] holidays , most likely in October or early November . 
[ORG GOI  ] officials agreed in principle , and will look at the calendar and propose dates. <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( U ) [PER A/S Shapiro  ] has cleared this cable. ********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy [LOC Tel Aviv  ] 's Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv ********************************************* ******************** CUNNINGHAM</pre></code>
