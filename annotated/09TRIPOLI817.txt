REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [ORG DCM  ] and [ORG DATT  ] met with [ORG MFA A/S-equivalent  ] [PER Ahmed Fituri  ] on October 8 , at his request , to discuss pending security assistance and mil-mil cooperation issues . 
[PER Fituri  ] said that he had arranged the meeting at the behest of [ORG Libyan National Security Advisor  ] Dr. [PER Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi , who was eager to move cooperation forward following [MISC Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi 's visit to the [LOC New York  ] for the [ORG UN General Assembly  ] . 
[PER Fituri  ] added that he hoped progress on these pending issues -- including possible [MISC Libyan  ] participation in Bright Star exercises -- would lay the groundwork for successful political-military talks later this year. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Noting that the [ORG National Security Advisor  ] had asked for clarification of certain language in the [MISC Section 505 Agreement  ] governing end-use of bilateral military assistance , [PER Fituri  ] asked whether the [LOC U.S.  ] had any further information . 
Drawing on ref a , [ORG DATT  ] briefed [PER Fituri  ] on Article E of the standard [MISC Section 505  ] language , explaining that the clause was included to cover any possible future bilateral military assistance that could be provided under other legal authorities . 
[ORG DATT  ] emphasized that this language did not in any way convey that the [LOC U.S.  ] was promising additional new military assistance . 
[PER Fituri  ] said that he understood , and would brief the [ORG National Security Advisor  ] on the issue. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Fituri  ] also asked for an update on the list of military equipment requested by [PER Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi during his April visit to the [LOC United States  ] . 
[ORG DATT  ] explained that the [LOC United States  ] had briefed the [ORG National Security Advisor  ] 's officer repeatedly on the regulations governing Foreign Military Sales and the appropriate way forward . 
Noting that the [LOC U.S.  ] was limited to non-lethal sales , the [ORG DATT  ] suggested that the [MISC Libyan  ] Government sign the pending Letters of Offer and Acceptance before initiating any new requests . 
[PER Fituri  ] agreed that this approach made sense , and said he hoped this topic could be included in any future political-military dialogue. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) [ORG DCM  ] noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] also had been looking at topics to include in a future political-military dialogue , and had identified man-portable air defense systems ( [ORG MANPADS  ] ) and humanitarian demining as potential areas of cooperation ( ref b ) . 
A new partnership on eliminating the threat of [ORG MANPADS  ] and eliminating [LOC Libya  ] 's landmine and [ORG UXO  ] problem would advance our shared security goals and complement our existing security cooperation . 
[PER Fituri  ] said he was not familiar with either of these issues , but would brief Foreign Minister [PER Musa Kusa  ] . 
He asked that we convey ref b points in a diplomatic note , highlighting the possibility of expert-level discussions . 
[ORG DCM  ] agreed to do so .
