End Summary . 
2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Libyan  ] press reported January 28 that Minister of [ORG Justice Mustafa  ] [PER Abduljalil  ] had submitted his resignation to the General People 's [ORG Congress  ] ( [ORG GPC  ] , parliament-equivalent ) due to his " inability to overcome the difficulties facing the judicial sector . 
" He cited the injustice of the [MISC Libyan  ] government 's decision to keep 300 citizens in prisons , in spite of judicial rulings overturning previous convictions , while the [ORG GOL  ] released convicted prisoners on death-row without informing the families of their victims , as required by [ORG Shari'a  ] law . 
3 . 
( C ) Initial local reaction to the news was mixed . 
[MISC Libyan  ] leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] , in his closing remarks to the annual [ORG GPC  ] session answered [PER Abduljalil  ] 's accusations , stating that most of the 300 prisoners " are al [MISC Qaeda  ] members , who killed [MISC Libyans  ] , " and proclaiming that " security is above all considerations . 
" He declared [PER Abduljalil  ] 's statements to be out of place , proclaiming , " The Minister of [ORG Justice  ] had the right to say what he said , but he should not have said it here . 
" [MISC Libyan  ] observers speculated that [PER Abduljalil  ] 's resignation would not be accepted by the [MISC Libyan  ] regime , which prefers to dismiss officials on its own terms . 
[ORG Human Rights Watch  ] representatives , who praised [PER Abduljalil  ] for his work on [LOC Libya  ] 's criminal code reform , worried that his departure would be a step backward for the justice system ( Ref A ) . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] 's local staff reports that citizens in [LOC Eastern Libya  ] , particularly in [LOC Benghazi  ] ( a historically disenfranchised part of the country under the [PER Qadhafi  ] regime ) , where most of the families of the victims of the1986 [LOC Abu Salim  ] prison riots reside , were proud of [PER Abduljalil  ] for standing up to an unjust regime . 
These families reportedly protest regularly in the name of innocent prisoners still held at [LOC Abu Salim  ] and other prisons that are controlled by the [ORG Libyan Internal Security Organization  ] , outside the jurisdiction of the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] ( [ORG MOJ  ] ) . 
4 . 
( C ) [ORG MOJ  ] officials who have close working relationships with the [ORG Embassy  ] refused to answer their phones from January 28 through February 1 . 
On February 2 , the [ORG MOJ  ] Head of [ORG International Cooperation  ] told [ORG Econoff  ] that [PER Abduljalil  ] 's resignation was not accepted and that he remains in place . 
In fact , the Minister had been planning an official trip to [LOC Turkey  ] in mid-February , and plans are moving ahead for that trip . 
5 . 
( C ) One [MISC Libyan  ] contact reported that [PER Abduljalil  ] , who is considered to be a fair-minded technocrat , was put in his position by [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi and would not be able to leave the position without [PER Saif  ] 's blessing . 
The contact stated that " nobody , not [PER Baghdadi  ] ( al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi , PM-equivalent ) or [PER Zwai  ] ( [PER Mohamed Zwai  ] , Secretary General of the [ORG GPC  ] ) can remove him from his position if [PER Saif  ] put him there . 
" He believed that only [PER Saif  ] or his father held the power to decide [PER Abduljalil  ] 's fate and that if they did want him to leave his position , the announcement would be made when the timing was best for them , such as after they had identified an acceptable alternative for the position . 
Pointing to [ORG National Oil Company  ] Chairman [PER Shukri Ghanem  ] 's attempted resignation last October ( Ref B ) , this contact said , " In [LOC Libya  ] , he who puts you in has to take you out . 
" 6 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Abduljalil  ] 's attempted resignation took place against the backdrop of political turmoil that has followed the October 2009 announcement of [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi 's plans to appoint [PER Saif  ] al-Islam [PER Qadhafi  ] as " General Coordinator . 
" The complete absence of any discussion of the General Coordinator position at the January [ORG GPC  ] furthered the growing uncertainty surrounding the [MISC Libyan  ] political structure . 
This is likely not the final installment in [PER Abduljalil  ] 's political drama , and his attempted resignation could have implications for [LOC Libya  ] 's criminal code reform efforts .
