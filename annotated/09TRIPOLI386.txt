End summary . 
LIBYA'S " [ORG THINK TANK  ] " TACKLES PROJECT PLANNING AFTER THE FACT <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The Ambassador discussed [LOC Libya  ] 's human development strategy in a May 6 courtesy call on [PER Mahmoud Jibril  ] , Chair of the [ORG National Economic Development Board  ] ( [ORG NEDB  ] ) , an organization that [PER Jibril  ] likened to a " think tank " of multi-disciplinary experts . 
Before the March 2009 cabinet shuffle , [PER Jibril  ] was simultaneously in charge of the [ORG NEDB  ] and the [ORG National Planning Council  ] , but now he directs only the [ORG NEDB  ] . 
He reports directly to the prime minister . 
A [MISC U.S.-educated  ] PhD in strategic planning , [PER Jibril  ] touched on familiar themes , such as [LOC Libya  ] 's need to diversify its economy away from oil ( reftel ) , but he also fleshed out how [LOC Libya  ] is tracking 11,000 development projects. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) According to [PER Jibril  ] , there are 11,000 development projects in [LOC Libya  ] spanning several sectors , with the bulk of projects focusing on infrastructure . 
The [ORG NEDB  ] 's role in these projects is to " pave the way " for private sector development , and to create a strategic partnership between private companies and the government . 
There is a still a " gap of distrust " dividing the two . 
As to whether [LOC Libya  ] has a [ORG Master Plan  ] that includes all the 11,000 projects , [PER Jibril  ] admitted that in the past two years , [LOC Libya  ] had started executing projects without such a plan . 
However , the [ORG NEDB  ] has been working with experts from Ernst and [PER Young  ] , the [ORG Oxford Group  ] , and lately with five consultants from [ORG UNDP  ] to advise the prime minister on the best sequencing and pacing of the projects in order to decrease poverty and unemployment . 
He explained they were developing a " mapping room " to show all the projects , in a similar way to how a navy tracks its submarines all over the world . 
This " room " will use econometric models to demonstrate the results of different plans . 
The [ORG NEDB  ] also plans to publish an assessment of the projects [LOC Libya  ] has embarked on thus far , including plans for the future , in July . 
Companies in various sectors that might have an interest in working in [LOC Libya  ] would be able to review the data and decide if any of the projects were attractive enough for them to invest in . 
In the meanwhile , he said the General People 's [ORG Committee for Planning ( Ministry of Planning-equivalent  ] ) should be able to provide details on [LOC Libya  ] 's ongoing and projected projects . 
BRICKS , MORTAR AND HUMAN INFRASTRUCTURE <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Jibril  ] stressed that [LOC Libya  ] needs not only new schools , houses , hospitals , and roads but also a plan to manage and maintain all these new facilities and projects . 
This would involve training [MISC Libyans  ] and in effect , " rebuilding human beings . 
" He said the [LOC United States  ] could help by encouraging people-to-people contacts . 
He suggested [LOC U.S.  ] universities be paired with [MISC Libyan  ] ones . 
If a [LOC U.S.  ] educational institution were established in [LOC Libya  ] , in his view , this would be a lasting investment that would withstand any political changes , citing the examples of the [MISC American  ] Universities of [LOC Beirut  ] and [LOC Cairo.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) As for opportunities for [LOC U.S.  ] companies , [PER Jibril  ] said [LOC Libya  ] was " opening widely and very fast " and that the world economic crisis had not hit [LOC Libya  ] . 
He characterized the economy as being " in a liquid phase , and not yet solidified , " with many opportunities for foreign companies willing to take the risk to come here . 
He recommended [LOC U.S.  ] firms focus on strategic projects , i.e. , ones that touch people 's lives , such as education and healthcare . 
[LOC Libya  ] would also need help managing facilities , such as airports . 
He contrasted [LOC Libya  ] to the [LOC Gulf  ] area , which he thought would remain unstable for the next ten years due to tensions with [LOC Iran  ] . 
[LOC Libya  ] , on the other hand , has a stable regime and is " virgin country " for investors. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Regarding possible programs with the [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy in [LOC Tripoli  ] , [PER Jibril  ] noted [ORG NEDB  ] was still reviewing six proposals from [MISC American  ] universities to train [MISC Libyan  ] diplomats . 
He expected the internal review to take another week . 
A [LOC U.S.  ] proposal in the economic sphere , via the [ORG U.S. Department of Commerce Commercial Law Development Program  ] , would send [ORG NEDB  ] TRIPOLI 00000386 002.2 OF 002 staff on a study tour of small business incubators in the [LOC U.S.  ] This had to be postponed until September or October in order to give the [ORG NEDB  ] staff time to assess the needs of their business advising program. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Comment: With a PhD in strategic planning from the [ORG University of Pittsburgh  ] , [PER Jibril  ] is a serious interlocutor who " gets " the [LOC U.S.  ] perspective . 
He is also not shy about sharing his views of [LOC U.S.  ] foreign policy , for example , opining that the [LOC U.S.  ] spoiled a golden opportunity to capitalize on its " soft power " ( [PER McDonald  ] 's , etc . 
) after the fall of the [LOC Soviet Union  ] in 1989 by putting " boots on the ground " in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
At the same time , his organization has a daunting task to tackle , in terms of rationalizing 11,000 development projects in the chaotic [MISC Libyan  ] government bureaucracy and also , to train [MISC Libyans  ] to work in new sectors outside of the hydrocarbons industry . 
[PER Jibril  ] has stated [MISC American  ] companies and universities are welcome to join him in this endeavor and we should take him up on his offer . 
End comment .
