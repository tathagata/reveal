( C ) SUMMARY: According to Prime Minister [PER Balkenende  ] 's chief foreign policy advisor , concerns about [MISC Venezuelan  ] interference in the [MISC Dutch  ] [LOC Antilles  ] and [LOC Aruba  ] have recently risen to the top of the [MISC Dutch  ] list of foreign policy priorities . 
A [PER Chavez  ] visit to the [LOC Netherlands  ] is not currently under consideration , but [PER Balkenende  ] may try to deliver a firm message to [PER Chavez  ] on the margins of the upcoming [ORG UNGA  ] . 
Foreign Minister Bot and Justice Minister [PER Donner  ] both plan to visit [LOC Caracas  ] in the next few months , and [PER Balkenende  ] is also considering a possible visit in November . 
During a recent briefing by a visiting [ORG USG Venezuela  ] expert , working level [ORG MFA  ] contacts admit that the [MISC Dutch  ] feel torn between their desire to support an [ORG EU  ] consensus on [LOC Venezuela  ] and protecting [MISC Dutch  ] national interests in the [LOC Caribbean  ] . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] have compiled a list of grievances ranging from flyovers by military aircraft to public statements by [MISC Venezuelan  ] officials recalling [MISC Venezuelan  ] territorial claims to the islands . 
Further [MISC U.S.-Dutch  ] consultations in this area would be beneficial to both parties . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Rob Swartbol  ] , Prime Minister [PER Balkenende  ] 's senior foreign policy advisor , told Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] on August 1 that the [MISC Dutch  ] government is increasingly concerned about [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Chavez'  ] efforts to broaden his influence in the [LOC Netherlands Antilles  ] and [LOC Aruba  ] . 
[PER Swartbol  ] acknowledged that for years the [MISC Dutch  ] did not take [MISC Venezuelan  ] maneuvering seriously , but stressed that now it is at top of our agenda . 
Prime Minister [PER Balkenende  ] has taken a personal interest in the issue , he added , and has asked for a paper in the next two to three weeks to help clarify [MISC Dutch  ] options . 
[PER Swartbol  ] confirmed that , contrary to earlier indications , the [MISC Dutch  ] do not plan to invite [PER Chavez  ] to visit The [LOC Netherlands  ] in the near future . 
If [PER Chavez  ] does come to The [LOC Netherlands  ] as part of a broader [MISC European  ] tour , however , the Prime Minister would expect to meet with him , he added. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] stressed that the [LOC U.S.  ] shared [MISC Dutch  ] concerns about destabilizing [MISC Venezuelan  ] moves in the region . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] , he added , could play a role in encouraging the [ORG EU  ] to stand firm against [PER Chavez'  ] destabilization efforts . 
The [ORG EU  ] , he added , needs to be very careful in engaging [PER Chavez  ] , who is a proven master at manipulating engagement efforts to his own advantage . 
[ORG EU  ] members considering selling weapons to [LOC Venezuela  ] for ostensibly legitimate purposes , in particular , need to understand the broader impacts of such sales . 
[PER Swartbol  ] agreed that the [ORG EU  ] should have a coordinated approach on arms sales and other issues that took such concerns into account . 
Although the [MISC Dutch  ] do not want to give [PER Chavez  ] a day in the sun , he added , they also see no realistic alternative to engagement at this point. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) According to [PER Swartbol  ] , Prime Minister [PER Balkenende  ] may propose meeting [PER Chavez  ] on the margins of the [ORG UNGA  ] in September to send a strong signal that [MISC Venezuelan  ] infiltration efforts in the islands are unacceptable . 
[PER Swartbol  ] suggested , however , that a final decision on whether [PER Balkenende  ] would engage [PER Chavez  ] in [LOC New York  ] would depend in part on FM Bot 's plans , as the Prime Minister would not want to engage [PER Chavez  ] before Bot has had an opportunity to meet with him . 
( Note: The [ORG MFA  ] told us on July 29 that Bot currently plans to visit [LOC Venezuela  ] in the October 17-24 timeframe . 
) If a meeting in [LOC New York  ] does not take place , the next logical time for a [MISC Balkenende-Chavez  ] meeting could be in November , when the Prime Minister is scheduled to travel to [LOC Suriname.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) PM [PER Balkenende  ] confirmed to Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] during a private meeting on July 29 that he hopes to engage [PER Chavez  ] directly about [MISC Dutch  ] concerns over the [LOC Antilles  ] , but left open the issue of timing and venue . 
In addition to the Bot and/or [PER Balkenende  ] meetings with [PER Chavez  ] , [MISC Dutch  ] Minister of Justice told the Ambassador on July 30 that he also plans to travel to [LOC Venezuela  ] , [LOC Colombia  ] , [LOC Suriname  ] , and [LOC Curacao  ] beginning August 27 . 
Although [PER Donner  ] 's trip will focus primarily on improving counter-narcotics cooperation in the region ( especially with [LOC Colombia  ] ) , [PER Donner  ] also expressed serious concerns about political developments in [LOC Venezuela  ] and [PER Chavez'  ] intentions toward the [LOC Netherlands Antilles  ] and [LOC Aruba  ] , which he described as our [LOC Malvinas.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Separately , during a briefing on [LOC Venezuela  ] by a visiting [ORG USG  ] expert on July 28 , [MISC Dutch  ] working-level representatives from the [ORG MFA  ] 's [ORG Western Hemisphere Department  ] expressed deep concern over the increasing frequency and growing seriousness of [MISC Venezuelan  ] attempts to influence and intimidate the [ORG Dutch Antilles'  ] government . 
[MISC Dutch  ] interlocutors provided a four page list of incidents ( reported in other channels ) to illustrate their concerns . 
These ranged from an unauthorized 2002 flyover of [LOC Curacao  ] by [MISC Venezuelan  ] military aircraft , to [MISC Venezuelan  ] accusations ( around the time of the [MISC USS Saipan  ] visit ) that the [LOC Antilles  ] supported [LOC U.S.  ] aggression against [LOC Venezuela  ] , to recent public statements ( including by the [MISC Venezuelan  ] Consul General in [LOC Curacao  ] and the Governor of [ORG Falcon  ] ) calling for a restoration of the historic relationship between [LOC Venezuela  ] and the islands . 
Most disturbing to the [MISC Dutch  ] were the many instances of [PER Chavez  ] apparently offering assistance to political figures ( including former minister [ORG Cova  ] ) to encourage them to challenge Prime Minister Ys' government as well as existing ties between The [LOC Netherlands  ] and the islands . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] representatives noted that [PER Chavez  ] had a wide range of tools for exerting influence on the islands , including the flow of oil , pro-Venezuelan politicians ( such as [ORG Cova  ] ) , and even criminal groups ( such as that gathered around former strongman Godett ) ; used together , these elements could have a powerful destabilizing effect on the islands and create serious problems for the [MISC Dutch  ] government. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [MISC Dutch  ] diplomats noted that they found it difficult to reconcile their national interests regarding the [LOC Antilles  ] with their general desire to support and implement [ORG EU  ] consensus positions . 
For example , the [MISC Dutch  ] found it unlikely that the [ORG EU  ] could find consensus on taking a strong public position on [MISC Venezuelan  ] [ORG Human Rights  ] abuses , although they argued that [ORG EU  ] representatives could and would deliver tough messages in private . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] diplomats noted that [PER Chavez  ] had successfully maneuvered to avoid having an [ORG EU  ] team observe elections in the past and predicted he would do so again , but doubted that this would lead to a public confrontation between the [ORG EU  ] and [LOC Caracas  ] . 
At the same time , the recent [MISC Dutch  ] deployment of [MISC F-16s  ] to [LOC Aruba  ] -- a move unrelated to any tensions with [LOC Venezuela  ] , but one they hoped [LOC Caracas  ] noticed -- demonstrated that the [MISC Dutch  ] remain capable of defending their national interests in the region if necessary . 
In recent meetings with the Ambassador and [ORG DAO  ] , [ORG CHOD Berlijn  ] said that the [MISC Dutch  ] are exploring options for boosting the military presence around the islands ( potentially including submarines and naval forces from other [ORG EU  ] members ) , primarily for counter-narcotics purposes . 
As noted ref a , the CEO of [ORG Royal Dutch Shell  ] has recently expressed concerns regarding [PER Chavez'  ] illogical approach to foreign investors and the potential impact of his policies in the region. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) COMMENT: As an [ORG EU  ] state with [LOC Caribbean  ] interests , the [MISC Dutch  ] have good justifications for assuming a leading role within the [ORG EU  ] in developing a strategy toward [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
Such a role does not come naturally to the [MISC Dutch  ] , however , and they will be reluctant to challenge traditional [MISC Spanish  ] leadership on [MISC Latin American  ] issues without serious cause and/or encouragement . 
A policy of confronting [PER Chavez  ] would also be risky domestically given the [MISC Dutch  ] public 's ambivalent attitude toward the [LOC Antilles  ] and [LOC Aruba  ] and the [MISC Dutch  ] colonial legacy in general . 
That said , senior [MISC Dutch  ] officials , including [PER Balkenende  ] , clearly understand that [PER Chavez'  ] machinations threaten [MISC Dutch  ] interests directly -- in addition to destabilizing the region more broadly -- but believe that their options for dealing with this threat are currently limited . 
We should continue to seek every opportunity to engage the [MISC Dutch  ] on this issue to help develop regional options for countering [PER Chavez'  ] destabilizing policies , and to encourage the [MISC Dutch  ] to work within [MISC European  ] circles to help stiffen the spine of the [ORG EU  ] . 
END COMMENT .
