12958: [PER N/A TAGS:  ] <a href='/tag/PGOV_0.html'>PGOV</a> <a href='/tag/ECON_0.html'>ECON</a> <a href='/tag/SENV_0.html'>SENV</a> <a href='/tag/BR_0.html'>BR</a> SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR THE VISIT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY MCMURRAY <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [LOC United States Mission  ] in [LOC Brazil  ] warmly welcomes your planned December 12-13 , 2006 , visit to [LOC Brasilia  ] . 
Counselor for [LOC Environment  ] , [LOC Science  ] , [ORG Technology and Health Patricia Norman  ] and [ORG OES Advisor  ] [PER Lawrence Sperling  ] will greet you upon your arrival in [LOC Brasilia  ] December 12 . 
You are scheduled to hold preliminary meetings for the [ORG U.S.-Brazil Common Agenda  ] for the [LOC Environment  ] on December 13 and meet with [MISC Brazilian  ] officials . 
In addition , we have scheduled a [ORG Country Team  ] meeting shortly after your arrival on Dec. 12 here at the [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy to brief you on the current state of affairs in [LOC Brazil.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Your visit , scheduled right after President [PER Lula  ] 's reelection , comes at a transition point on the political scene . 
During the second semester of 2005 , congressional deputies from [PER Lula  ] 's governing coalition were accused of accepting bribes , while officials from the President 's party ( the [ORG PT  ] ) were alleged to have engaged in influence peddling and illegal campaign fund-raising . 
These revelations forced the resignation of several members of [PER Lula  ] 's inner circle , including his former Chief of Staff ( who was also expelled from [ORG Congress  ] ) . 
Another scandal that was revealed in September 2006 caused the resignations of several top [PER Lula  ] campaign officials and the head of the [ORG PT.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) However , [PER Lula  ] was able to surmount all this and win reelection with 61 percent of the vote . 
He is now mulling his options with regard to which parties his [ORG PT  ] banner should ally with in [ORG Congress  ] and who to include in his cabinet . 
THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP -------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While relations between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] are friendly , often the [ORG USG  ] encounters major difficulties in gaining the cooperation of senior policymakers on issues of significant interest to the [LOC United States  ] . 
Eager to assert its own influence , the [MISC Brazilian  ] government shies away from cooperation with the [ORG USG  ] - unless it can clearly be characterized as a reciprocal exchange among equals . 
Indeed , hyper-sensitivity on issues viewed as infringing on [LOC Brazil  ] 's sovereignty can get out of hand and may be seen as signs of political immaturity . 
Many [MISC Brazilians  ] believe the [LOC U.S.  ] has designs on the [LOC Amazon  ] . 
Our fingerprinting of visitors to the [LOC U.S.  ] drew reciprocal treatment for [MISC Americans  ] here ; visa and immigration issues remain sensitive points. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) During recent months , our ongoing dialogue with the [MISC Brazilians  ] has focused on a variety of potentially useful projects for both sides . 
We sought to interest the [ORG GOB  ] in a [ORG Defense Cooperation Accord  ] , but the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] rejected the proposal even though the [ORG Defense Ministry  ] was supportive . 
Gaining agreement on privileges and immunities to be granted [LOC U.S.  ] servicemen engaging in military exercises has been just as tough , as the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] saw it as " a foot in the door " and linked it with [LOC Brazil  ] 's strong opposition to [ORG Article  ] 98 agreements . 
We are receptive to renegotiation of a stalled bilateral agreement governing space launches at the country 's equatorial base at [LOC Alcantara  ] , but the [ORG GOB  ] has moved glacially to re-engage , even though the agreement clearly serves [MISC Brazilian  ] interests . 
On trade issues , when unscripted , President [PER Lula  ] has characterized the [ORG FTAA  ] as " off his agenda . 
" IPR is another sore point , as it has become clear that the [ORG USG  ] and the [MISC Brazilian  ] government have different views on the degree of protection to be afforded to intellectual property . 
Only after much lobbying have we gotten the [ORG GOB  ] to: a ) turn the corner on copyright piracy , and b ) persuaded policymakers to pursue negotiated solutions rather than compulsory licensing of [MISC AIDS  ] anti-retrovirals. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) However , not all our conversations are difficult . 
At the personal level , [PER Lula  ] has met President [PER Bush  ] several times and the two have a good rapport . 
On issues involving matters perceived as technical in nature - i.e. , law enforcement and science ( but not counter-terrorism ) - the [ORG GOB  ] is eager to engage . 
For example , from 2003 to 2004 , the [ORG GOB  ] worked quietly with us on the timing and details of its shoot-down program to accommodate our statutory requirements . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Ministry of Health  ] has expressed its desire to expand the collaboration it has with the [ORG U.S. Centers for Disease Control  ] and the [ORG National Institutes of Health  ] as these agencies work within the [MISC Brazilian  ] medical community to bring newer treatments and technologies . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Ministry for the Environment  ] has asked the [LOC United States  ] for technical support in several key environmental areas that offer us an important opportunity for closer bilateral cooperation. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On development assistance issues , our dialogue is positive - but constrained . 
Notwithstanding lackluster results to date , the [MISC Brazilian  ] government 's multi-billion dollar poverty alleviation program -Zero Hunger - receives substantial funding from the [ORG World Bank  ] and [ORG IDB  ] . 
Given [ORG USG  ] budget constraints and the fact that [ORG Zero Hunger  ] is , in essence , a cash transfer program ( albeit with conditions ) , [ORG USAID  ] support has been limited . 
Instead of focusing on [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00002583 002 OF 005 cash transfers to the poor , [ORG USAID  ] has sought to target its efforts towards promoting sustainable livelihoods - inter alia , through working with small and medium-sized enterprises . 
The Embassy 's Public Affairs programs aimed at promoting young leaders take a similar targeted approach . 
This difference in focus , broad cash transfers versus targeted assistance , ends up putting the [ORG USG  ] at the margins of [LOC Brazil  ] 's overall anti-poverty efforts . 
FOREIGN POLICY -------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Reflecting [LOC Brazil  ] 's ambivalence towards the [LOC United States  ] , President [PER Lula  ] has run an activist foreign policy with a focus on [LOC South America  ] and the Third World , seeking to forge alliances with other mid-sized powers ( [LOC South Africa  ] , [LOC India  ] , etc . 
) . 
He has traveled extensively in pursuit of a higher international profile for [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Despite prodding from the [ORG USG  ] and others , [PER Lula  ] has refused to condemn [LOC Cuba  ] for human rights violations and , in fact , has pushed for [MISC Cuban  ] membership in the [ORG Rio Group  ] . 
[LOC Brazil  ] has also advocated a [MISC Cuba-Mercosul  ] trade pact . 
The [ORG GOB  ] has worked to increase both its economic and political ties with [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
It has agreed to upgrade [LOC Venezuela  ] from associate membership to full membership status in [LOC Mercosul  ] and enhanced integration of the two countries' energy sectors is high on its agenda . 
[PER Lula  ] has been especially solicitous of [PER Chavez  ] . 
[PER Lula  ] has praised the [MISC Venezuelan  ] President 's democratic credentials ( " if anything , [LOC Venezuela  ] has an excess of democracy " ) and declared that the [PER Chavez  ] government had been demonized by its foes . 
However , [LOC Venezuela  ] 's apparent involvement in [LOC Bolivia  ] 's recent decision to nationalize that country 's oil and gas industry has dulled the luster on this relationship. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Given its size and natural resources , [LOC Brazil  ] has long seen itself as the natural leader of the region ( even though that perception is not shared by its neighbors ) . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's reaction to [LOC Bolivia  ] 's May 2006 nationalization of foreign petroleum installations in that country is a case in point . 
Shocked that the [MISC Bolivians  ] viewed the [MISC Brazilian  ] oil parastatal [ORG Petrobras  ] as a " boss , not a partner , " government policymakers have vacillated in response to President [PER Morales'  ] threats. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Emblematic of [LOC Brazil  ] 's efforts to gain greater standing on the world stage is its tenacious pursuit of a permanent [ORG UN Security Council  ] ( [ORG UNSC  ] ) seat . 
In fact , many observers point out that [LOC Brazil  ] has " subordinated " other economic and political interests with such countries as [LOC China  ] and [LOC Russia  ] in exchange for support ( which has not been forthcoming ) for its [ORG UNSC  ] aspirations . 
[LOC Brazil  ] and other G4 states ( [LOC India  ] , [LOC Germany  ] , [LOC Japan  ] ) are , despite recent setbacks , continuing to press their campaign for a vote on a resolution on [ORG UNSC  ] reform . 
This stance is at odds with the position of many [MISC Latin American  ] countries , including those which [LOC Brazil  ] believes should follow its " natural leadership . 
" <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Brazil  ] has long seen international fora as a way to enhance its international stature . 
Reflecting this , in 2005 it launched failed national candidates for the top jobs at both the [ORG WTO  ] and the [ORG IDB  ] . 
The failure of both , together with the unlikely prospects for a permanent seat in the [ORG UNSC  ] , has widely been seen in [LOC Brazil  ] as a " political disaster . 
" AGRICULTURE ----------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Agriculture is a major sector of the [MISC Brazilian  ] economy , and is key for economic growth and foreign exchange . 
Agriculture accounts for 13% of GDP ( and 30% when including agribusiness ) and 33% of [MISC Brazilian  ] exports . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is the world 's largest producer of sugar cane , coffee , tropical fruits , frozen concentrated orange juice ( [ORG FCOJ  ] ) , and has the world 's largest commercial cattle herd ( 50% larger than the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) at 180 million head . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is also an important producer of soybeans ( second to the [LOC United States  ] ) , corn , cotton , cocoa , tobacco , and forest products . 
The remainder of agricultural output is in the livestock sector , mainly the production of beef and poultry ( second to the [LOC United States  ] ) , pork , milk , and seafood . 
[LOC ENVIRONMENT  ] ----------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) As one of the world 's " megadiverse " countries , environmental issues loom large in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Of the world 's known plant species , 22% exist in [LOC Brazil  ] , and the figures for birds ( 17% ) , mammals ( 11% ) , and fish ( 11% ) are also significant . 
The [LOC Amazon  ] basin holds 20% of the world 's fresh water . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's Minister for the [LOC Environment  ] , [PER Marina Silva  ] , has secured passage of legislation protecting 20 million hectares of land during her administration and she has indicated that [LOC Brazil  ] would like to follow the [LOC U.S.  ] model and establish public parks on the protected land . 
Minister [PER Silva  ] has also passed legislation establishing the first [MISC Brazilian  ] forest [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00002583 003 OF 005 service . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] agencies that work with parks in the [LOC U.S.  ] are poised to collaborate with [LOC Brazil  ] on these issues . 
[LOC Brazil  ] and the [LOC United States  ] are also discussing collaboration on the [ORG U.S.-sponsored Coalition Against Wildlife Trafficking  ] . 
[LOC Amazon  ] deforestation rates for the period August 2004 to August 2005 reflect a 31% drop , and the [ORG GOB  ] is predicting another 11% drop this year . 
These figures are still affected , however , by the strong expansion in [MISC Brazilian  ] agriculture , particularly the drive for land by the cattle and soy industries. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Internationally , [LOC Brazil  ] is an energetic advocate on environmental issues and treaties including the [ORG Kyoto Protocol  ] . 
Yet , for many , the [MISC Brazilian  ] government has not met the high and largely exaggerated expectations of many environmentalists during the first years of the [ORG Lula Administration  ] . 
The early 2005 passage of a Biosafety law , representing an opportunity to legalize [ORG GMO  ] crops , drew especially strong criticism from environmentalists . 
The agricultural industry 's lobbying for expansion of the transportation network in the [LOC Amazon  ] has raised additional concern . 
As in other policy areas , the [ORG Lula Administration  ] is more centrist on environmental issues than much of its devoted , leftist political base expected . 
ETHANOL ------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The success of [LOC Brazil  ] 's ethanol program has made it a model for the world in terms of alternative energy . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's comparative advantage is its ability to inexpensively produce ethanol from sugarcane , which has the highest starch content of any plant stock . 
In addition to obtaining five harvests from one planting , cane hulls ( bagasse ) are used to produce the thermal energy necessary to power the conversion process . 
Cane also requires less processing than ethanol produced from corn -- which is the method used in the [LOC U.S.  ] to manufacture ethanol . 
According to the [ORG World Bank  ] , at current prices , [LOC Brazil  ] can make ethanol for about [MISC US$1  ] a gallon , compared with the international price of about [MISC US$1.50  ] a gallon for gasoline . 
At the pump ethanol receives favorable tax treatment from the [MISC Brazilian  ] government . 
It is exempted from the largest federal tax on gasoline ( [ORG CIDE  ] ) and is subject to lower rates on two other federal levies ( PIS and COFINS ) . 
Nevertheless , ethanol prices can vary substantially from state to state . 
In contrast , gasoline prices tend to vary less and are controlled by the government. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Since the 1980s , [LOC Brazil  ] has attempted , without great success , to promote ethanol fuel exports to the [LOC United States  ] . 
[LOC U.S.  ] tariffs and charges make [MISC Brazilian  ] imports uncompetitive . 
In addition to import tariffs of 1.9 to 2.5 percent , the [LOC U.S.  ] imposes a 54 cents/gallon charge on ethanol imported for use as fuel . 
These charges must be paid by countries not covered by FTAs or other trade preference arrangements . 
Given the requirements of its fast-growing domestic market , whether [LOC Brazil  ] will indeed be able to produce enough ethanol to supply international markets is an open question . 
Some estimate that over the next one to two years , the maximum percentage of [LOC Brazil  ] 's cane crop which can be devoted to ethanol production is 54% . 
If so , this would mean that [MISC Brazilian  ] ethanol production is already running at 95 percent of capacity ; and the country 's ability to expand its sugarcane acreage is limited to perhaps 20 percent over the next 3-4 years . 
PRESIDENT [PER LULA  ] -------------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) President [PER Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  ] was inaugurated in January 2003 after a career as a [LOC Sao Paulo  ] metalworker and labor leader . 
He founded the left-of-center [ORG Workers' Party  ] ( [ORG PT  ] ) in 1980 and lost three presidential campaigns before winning in the October 2002 elections . 
[PER Lula  ] was reelected with a comfortable margin of victory in October 2006 . 
Elected in large part on promises of promoting an ambitious social agenda , including a " [MISC Zero Hunger  ] " program , [PER Lula  ] 's government has failed to deliver much in this area , as managerial shortcomings and the public 's top concern - crime and public security - have not improved under this administration. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As noted above , in the run-up to the October 2006 election , the [ORG Lula Administration  ] was beset by a grave political crisis as interlocking influence peddling/vote-buying scandals plagued elements of [PER Lula  ] 's [ORG PT  ] party . 
Indeed , during the second half of 2005 , the crisis placed [PER Lula  ] on the defensive and politics were dominated by investigations , accusations and revelations . 
The President 's Chief of Staff resigned his post and was later expelled from [ORG Congress  ] . 
Meanwhile , several other congressmen were the subjects of investigations and expulsion proceedings owing to bribery allegations . 
In April 2006 , the President 's influential Finance Minister was forced to resign ( and remains under criminal investigation ) because of unrelated abuse of power allegations . 
The revelation of a new scandal shortly before the presidential election [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00002583 004 OF 005 involving accusations against members of [PER Lula  ] 's campaign who were his long-time associates briefly seemed to threaten his reelection prospects , and sent the contest into a second round . 
But [PER Lula  ] survived the crisis and , supported by millions of poor voters who benefit from federal social spending programs , [PER Lula  ] was reelected . 
[LOC MACRO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS  ] --------------------------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) President [PER Lula  ] and his economic team have implemented prudent fiscal and monetary policies and pursued necessary reforms . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's external accounts , aided by a benign international environment , have improved substantially over the last three years . 
Although GDP growth dropped to 2.3% in 2005 , down from a strong performance ( 4.9% ) in 2004 , [LOC Brazil  ] has experienced booming exports , healthy external accounts , inflation under control , decreasing unemployment and reductions in the debt-to-GDP ratio . 
Economic activity should pick up in 2006 ; the markets expect GDP growth of about 3.0% . 
Buoyed by exports and investment inflows , the Real has remained at appreciated levels , allowing the government and businesses to pay down external debt . 
The government pre-paid its [ORG IMF  ] obligations , its last remaining rescheduled [ORG Paris Club  ] obligations , and in April 2006 announced it had retired the last of its [ORG Brady  ] bonds . 
This removes from the books all restructured debt associated with [LOC Brazil  ] 's late-1980 's default . 
Based upon the improving external debt dynamics , [ORG Fitch IBCA  ] upgraded its credit rating on [LOC Brazil  ] 's sovereign debt in February 2006 , to [ORG BB  ] ( two notches below investment grade ) . 
The economy also has shown resilience , remaining for the most part unaffected by a major political scandal and the replacement of the finance minister. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Despite this considerable progress , key challenges remain . 
The public sector-debt-to-GDP ratio is on a downward trend but remains high , at about 50% . 
Real interest rates are among the highest in the world ; reducing them will require both reductions in the government 's borrowing requirement and reform of the financial sector and the judiciary . 
Income and land distribution remain skewed . 
Investment and domestic savings are low , although growing . 
The informal sector constitutes between 35 to 40 percent of the economy , in part because the tax burden ( nearly 38 percent of GDP ) is high. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Sustaining high growth rates in the longer term depends on the impact of President [PER Lula  ] 's structural reform program and efforts to build a more welcoming climate for investment , both domestic and foreign . 
In its first year , the [PER Lula  ] administration passed key tax and pension reforms to improve the government fiscal accounts . 
Judicial reform and an overhaul of the bankruptcy law , which should improve the functioning of credit markets , were passed in late 2004 , along with tax measures to create incentives for long-term savings and investments. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Public-Private Partnerships , a key effort to attract private investment to infrastructure , also passed in 2004 , although implementation of this initiative still awaits promulgation of the necessary regulations . 
Labor reform , additional tax reform and autonomy for the [ORG Central Bank  ] were on the agenda for 2005 to 2006 , but now are unlikely to be addressed at least until the new year begins . 
Much remains to be done . 
The government needs to improve the regulatory climate for investment , particularly in the energy sector ; to simplify torturous tax systems at the state and federal levels ; and to further reform the pension system . 
TRADE POLICY ------------ <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) To increase its international profile ( both economically and politically ) , the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] ( [ORG Itamaraty  ] ) is seeking expanded trade ties with developing countries , as well as strengthening the [MISC Mercosul  ] customs union with [LOC Uruguay  ] , [LOC Paraguay  ] and [LOC Argentina  ] . 
Arguably the GoB has fallen short on this latter objective . 
The [MISC Brazil-Argentine  ] relationship is rife with trade disputes , recently leading to adoption of a safeguard mechanism for bilateral trade . 
Meanwhile , [LOC Uruguay  ] and [LOC Paraguay  ] regularly complain that [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Argentina  ] reap a disproportionate share of benefits from the bloc , and threaten the group 's solidarity in various ways -- for instance , [LOC Uruguay  ] 's recent discussions with the [LOC United States  ] regarding a possible [ORG FTA  ] ( which would contravene [MISC Mercosul  ] rules ) . <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Nonetheless , the bloc remains engaged in certain external trade negotiations . 
In 2004 , [MISC Mercosul  ] concluded free trade agreements with [LOC Colombia  ] , [LOC Ecuador  ] , [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Peru  ] , adding to its existing agreements with [LOC Chile  ] and [LOC Bolivia  ] to establish a commercial base for the newly-launched [ORG South American Community of Nations  ] . 
As noted earlier , [MISC Mercosul  ] is upgrading [LOC Venezuela  ] 's status from associate to full membership . 
In addition to [LOC Cuba  ] , the bloc is currently exploring free trade talks with [LOC Israel  ] , the [LOC Dominican Republic  ] , [LOC Panama  ] and states of the [ORG Gulf Cooperation Council  ] , as well [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00002583 005 OF 005 as trying to build on partial trade liberalization agreements concluded with [LOC India  ] and [LOC South Africa  ] in 2004. <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC China  ] , which was offered market economy status by [LOC Brazil  ] as a part of [PER Lula  ] 's effort to secure [LOC PRC  ] support for [LOC Brazil  ] 's bid for a [ORG USNC  ] seat , has increased its importance as an export market for [MISC Brazilian  ] soy , iron ore and steel , becoming [LOC Brazil  ] 's fourth largest trading partner and a potential source of investment . 
However , low-priced [MISC Chinese  ] imports , particularly in the textile , footwear , and toy sectors , are now threatening to displace domestic [MISC Brazilian  ] production . 
As many [MISC Brazilian  ] observers have indicated , all this effort is aimed at countries which together represent less than a third of [LOC Brazil  ] 's foreign trade . 
Free trade negotiations with the [ORG EU  ] continue to languish . 
[ORG DOHA AGENDA  ] - [ORG WTO  ] ----------------- <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While [LOC Brazil  ] emphasizes [ORG South-South  ] trade through [MISC Mercosul  ] 's bilateral negotiations , it uses that [ORG Doha Development Agenda  ] ( [ORG DDA  ] ) negotiations as the main forum for engaging with developed country partners . 
The [ORG DDA  ] is [LOC Brazil  ] 's top trade priority , viewed as the last chance for perhaps 15-20 years to secure fundamental changes in international trade rules , in particular , for international agricultural trade . 
[LOC Brazil  ] leads the [MISC G-20  ] group of developing countries that is pressing for agricultural trade reform in the [ORG DDA  ] . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's assertive leadership of the [MISC G-20  ] was blamed in some quarters for causing the failure of the [ORG WTO Cancun Ministerial  ] in September 2003 . 
Since then , [LOC Brazil  ] has been more constructively engaged in the [LOC Doha Round  ] , initially as a member of the " [MISC Five Interested Parties  ] " and more recently [ORG G-6  ] informal group , although many of its positions are still at odds with [LOC U.S.  ] interests . 
At the December 2005 [LOC Hong Kong  ] Ministerial meeting , [LOC Brazil  ] was key to brokering the deal - albeit one of limited ambition - coming out of that session . 
[LOC Brazil  ] can be expected to maintain its assertive stance in the [LOC Doha Round  ] on agricultural trade reform while taking more defensive postures in the discussions covering industrial products and services . 
FREE TRADE OF THE AMERICAS - [ORG FTAA  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As indicated above , the [ORG Lula Administration  ] shows no serious interest in pursuing the [ORG FTAA  ] . 
Despite serving as co-chair and having secured in the November 2003 [LOC Miami  ] meeting a new framework for negotiation , [LOC Brazil  ] has shown no inclination to move the process along and has so far declined to convoke the next [ORG FTAA Ministerial  ] - which is now overdue .
