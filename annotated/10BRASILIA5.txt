( C ) Summary . 
With both sides unwilling to promote distinctive alternatives to prevailing economic policy in a pre-election environment , [LOC Brazil  ] 's two principal rival parties - President [PER Lula  ] 's [ORG Worker 's Party  ] ( [ORG PT  ] ) and front-running presidential candidate [PER Jose Serra  ] 's [ORG Brazilian Social Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG PSDB  ] ) - are increasingly eager to air their differences on foreign policy . 
[ORG Congressional  ] voting and debate over issues such as [LOC Colombia-Venezuela  ] , [LOC Honduras  ] , and [LOC Iran  ] have grown increasingly partisan , with coalition lines enforced . 
Strongly opinionated individual members , especially those who travel frequently to key countries , have proven more effective than party leaders or relevant committees in shaping the foreign policy debate . 
In the case of [ORG PT  ] , this allows some of their most militant to shape priorities , as seen in [ORG PT  ] 's new foreign policy platform , tentatively approved in December . 
[ORG PT  ] has addressed its lack of foreign policy outside of [PER Lula  ] by bolstering the credentials of presidential candidate [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] with recent visits to [LOC Copenhagen  ] and [LOC Germany  ] . 
[ORG PSDB  ] and its allies , meanwhile , are staking out positions neither rightist nor isolationist - most heavily favor [LOC Brazil  ] 's stance on post-Kyoto negotiations in [LOC Copenhagen  ] , for example - but wish to promote a [MISC Brazilian  ] foreign policy more in line with traditional , pre-Lula approaches . 
As 2010 unfolds , the [ORG PT  ] and the [ORG PSDB  ] can be expected to continue ratcheting up the rhetoric on foreign policy , largely due to the need to find a way to distinguish their parties before the October elections . 
End summary . 
The [ORG Emerging Issue  ] ? <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In separate late December discussions , federal deputy [PER Bruno Araujo  ] ( [ORG PSDB-Pernambuco  ] ) and [PER Valter Pomar  ] , Director of [ORG PT  ] 's [ORG International Relations  ] office , made the same basic point to poloff: foreign policy will be a bigger campaign issue in 2010 than in previous elections , and that their respective parties see it as advantageous to their side for it to be so . 
Neither is under illusion that the general public will much focus on foreign policy , and each conceded that they are pressing foreign policy matters for other reasons . 
[PER Araujo  ] , like other tucanos ( members of [ORG PSDB  ] ) , acknowledged that his party has become more aggressive on foreign policy in large part because it is not advantageous for them to oppose popular government economic initiatives like the [MISC Pre-Salt  ] oil legislation . 
He further argued that voters , the media , and most rank-in-file diplomats at [ORG Itamaraty  ] ( [ORG Ministry of Foreign Relations  ] ) disagree with [LOC Brazil  ] 's recent adventurous tack in foreign policy. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Pomar  ] explained [ORG PT  ] 's desire to highlight [LOC Brazil  ] 's increasingly visible foreign policy as a means of communicating with the voter about what [LOC Brazil  ] can become - a first-tier country . 
He said that keeping issues such as [LOC Honduras  ] , the [LOC Middle East  ] , and [LOC Copenhagen  ] in the public sphere reinforces to the voter the image of a new [LOC Brazil  ] , and that the debate with [ORG PSDB  ] shows voters that the party of [PER Lula  ] and [PER Dilma  ] is the only real vehicle for achieving that outcome . 
Other petista ( [ORG PT  ] member ) voices , such as Dep . 
[PER Emiliano Jose  ] ( [LOC PT-Bahia  ] ) made an argument mirroring that of [ORG PSDB  ] 's [PER Araujo  ] . 
" The economy is about negotiations and compromises....With the [LOC U.S.  ] in [LOC Colombia...we  ] will be militante . 
" [LOC Colombia  ] , he added , will not be the only issue where [ORG PT  ] members will emphasize their differences with [LOC U.S.  ] policy during this election year. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Votes in [ORG Congress  ] show the increasingly enforced divide and the more heated quality of the rhetoric . 
The December 18 [ORG Senate  ] vote to approve [LOC Venezuela  ] 's accession to [LOC Mercosul  ] , while expected , was carried out on a strict party line vote that did not reflect the privately held views of many senators . 
In comparison with a mid-October [LOC Mercosul  ] vote count estimate provided to poloff by Sen. [PER Arthur Virgilio  ] ( [ORG Amazonas  ] ) , leader of the [ORG PSDB  ] in [ORG Senate  ] and a key opponent of [LOC Venezuela  ] 's accession , at least one-quarter of the senate - including several members from both sides - switched their projected vote by December due to pressure from each side 's respective coalition leadership . 
[ORG Senate  ] floor debate was unusually rancorous . 
( see ref A for more on [LOC Mercosul  ] . 
) President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's November visit brought a similarly heated response , with hours of pointed speeches on both sides . 
The vast majority of activists in these debates are tucanos and petistas , with [ORG PSDB  ] 's coalition partners [ORG DEM  ] and [ORG PPS  ] also playing a visible role . 
The [ORG Brazilian Democratic Movement  ] party ( [ORG PMDB  ] ) , [ORG PT  ] 's primary coalition partner in the government , only sometimes joins the debate - strongly aligned with [PER Lula  ] on [LOC Mercosul  ] but much more distanced on [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Honduras  ] . 
The many small center-right parties within [PER Lula  ] 's governing coalition are conspicuously silent on foreign policy . 
Travels to the [LOC Andes  ] , [LOC Honduras  ] , [LOC Sudan  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( SBU ) Given the weak role of [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Congress  ] in foreign policy , with limited budget-shaping ability and oversight of [LOC MRE  ] , activist individual members play a large role in shaping party positions and debate . 
Members with acknowledged foreign policy expertise who travel frequently , such as Dep . 
[PER Raul Jungmann  ] ( [MISC PPS-PE  ] ) , become more influential than committee chairmen - to the extent that Foreign Affairs Committee and both [ORG Senate  ] and [ORG Chamber  ] presidency staff have complained to poloff recently that [ORG Congress  ] has lost institutional control over its ever-expanding number of CODELs that purport to speak for the [ORG GOB  ] . 
Trips over the last two months that received media coverage include [LOC Honduras  ] , the [MISC Andean  ] region , [LOC Egypt  ] , and [LOC Sudan  ] , in addition to the 40-member congressional delegation in [LOC Copenhagen  ] in December . 
In some cases , bipartisan delegations work well together . 
[ORG PSDB  ] 's [PER Araujo  ] and Dep . 
[PER Mauricio Rands  ] ( [MISC PT-PE  ] ) , both members of the October delegation to [LOC Honduras  ] organized by [PER Jungmann  ] , told us enthusiastically that , despite differences of opinion , the mission focused successfully on the single goal of protecting the [MISC Brazilian  ] Embassy housing deposed president [PER Manuel Zelaya  ] ( ref C ) . <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Other delegations become more politicized . 
[PER Jungmann  ] 's mid-November delegation to [LOC Colombia  ] , [LOC Venezuela  ] , and [LOC Ecuador  ] - which included visits with [MISC Colombian  ] President [PER Uribe  ] and [MISC Ecuadorian  ] President [PER Correa  ] - revealed sharp differences among participants . 
[PER Jungmann  ] , per his post-visit conversations with [ORG Recife Principal Officer  ] and [LOC Brasilia  ] poloff , expressed concern that low-level armed conflict between [LOC Colombia  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] was now quite likely . 
He did not see the [ORG U.S.-Colombia Defense Cooperation Agreement  ] ( [ORG DCA  ] ) as a contributing factor in regional instability or as any particular novelty . 
In contrast , the [ORG PT  ] member in the delegation , Dep . 
[PER Emiliano Jose  ] ( [LOC Bahia  ] ) , returned making speeches claiming that the USG is building seven new army bases in [LOC Colombia  ] , and that the [LOC U.S.  ] is planning to build up troop size in order to carry out missions in neighboring countries . 
Another [ORG PT  ] Deputy , [PER Nilson Mourao  ] ( [ORG Acre  ] ) , traveled to [LOC Sudan  ] in September at GOS expense and returned issuing a spirited defense of [MISC Sudanese  ] President [PER Omar al-Bashir  ] , including a sharp rejection of the international community 's approach to [LOC Sudan  ] . 
PT: The [ORG Militant View  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Hardliners such as [PER Jose  ] and [PER Mourao  ] play a strong role in [ORG PT  ] 's public foreign policy because the party counts few among its ranks who have training or natural interest in the area . 
Their historical distrust of the [LOC United States  ] can make communication difficult . 
Early December conversations between poloff and Dep . 
[PER Emiliano Jose  ] and Dep . 
[PER Jose Genoino  ] ( [PER PT-Sao Paulo  ] ) bogged down into extended discussions about a [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Air Force  ] budget document , which they were convinced was a mistakenly released confidential document that proved [LOC U.S.  ] intentions to carry out military operations against neighboring governments . 
While it seemed that we made progress clarifying the nature of the document and the [ORG DCA  ] in general , it was equally clear that the [ORG PT  ] deputies did not want to be convinced . 
As [PER Jose  ] put it , " [ORG PT  ] has its own vision of [LOC South America  ] , which is against the presence of the [LOC U.S.  ] military . 
That will not change . 
" In early December , [PER Jose  ] and [PER Genoino  ] successfully pushed for language in [ORG PT  ] 's draft international policy platform chastising the [LOC U.S.  ] for its " military buildup " and " new [LOC U.S.  ] bases " in [LOC Colombia  ] . 
( Comment: While [ORG PT  ] leaders had been previously briefed on the real nature of the [MISC U.S.-Colombia  ] [ORG DCA  ] , the message has not been relayed down the ranks and the perceived advantages during an election year of a public stand against an [MISC American  ] presence in the region make such a position irresistible . 
End Comment ) <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) There are some checks within [ORG PT  ] against such hard-liner inaccuracies . 
The [ORG PT International Relations  ] office went out of its way to tell us that [PER Mourao  ] 's glowing report in support of the [MISC Sudanese  ] government represented neither [ORG PT  ] nor [ORG GOB  ] positions , and that [PER Mourao  ] was told to quiet down . 
[ORG PT  ] staff and party moderates also softened and/or removed language in the draft international platform that directly criticized the [LOC U.S.  ] position in [LOC Honduras  ] and the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
The [ORG PT  ] nevertheless promotes [PER Mourao  ] as its " [LOC Middle East  ] expert , " despite his strong biases and evident lack of understanding of the basics of the region . 
He helped organize schedules for the November [PER Ahmadinejad  ] and [ORG Abbas  ] visits , and , according to several sources , is the party 's designated interlocutor with all embassies from the region except [LOC Israel  ] 's . 
( It bears noting that Foreign Minister [PER Celso Amorim  ] officially affiliated with [ORG PT  ] in September and has taken an increasingly active interest in the region , to be reported septel . 
) There are no signs that [ORG PT  ] has anyone else available to work [LOC Middle East  ] issues. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) As the 2010 elections approach , the [ORG PT  ] will find itself under pressure to keep such party hardliners out of view as it tries to sell presidential candidate [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] as the leader of an emerging , optimistic , internationalist [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[PER Rousseff  ] was heavily advertised as the point person for the [MISC Brazilian  ] delegation at the [ORG COP-15 Climate Change Conference  ] . 
She also accompanied [PER Lula  ] to [LOC Germany  ] before [LOC Copenhagen  ] . 
[PER Rousseff  ] surprised by making statements in [LOC Germany  ] to the effect that [ORG GOB  ] recognition of the November 29 [MISC Honduran  ] elections will have to be reconsidered down the line . 
As reported in ref B , [PER Lula  ] also went out of his way to contrive a prominent [PER Rousseff  ] role in Rio 's successful 2016 [MISC Olympic  ] bid . 
[ORG PT  ] contacts view [PER Rousseff  ] 's international travel not only as a means of bolstering her foreign policy credentials - which they admit are weak - but also as a way of communicating to the voter that [LOC Brazil  ] will continue to be a bold emerging player on the international scene . 
The [ORG PT  ] is convinced the voters want this even if they don't know all the details ; [ORG Pomar  ] described it in terms of projecting the optimism of the [ORG PT  ] against the cautious pessimism of the [ORG PSDB  ] . 
In a pre-Copenhagen meeting with poloff , Dep . 
[PER Rands  ] ( [ORG PT  ] ) defended the idea that [LOC Brazil  ] could cut projected CO2 emissions 39 percent by 2020 , but also said the emissions goal was set with the image of [LOC Brazil  ] and [PER Rousseff  ] squarely in mind . 
The [ORG Opposition: Traditionalist  ] , not Center-Right <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The [ORG PSDB  ] and its fellow opposition members sense opportunity vis-C -vis the [ORG PT  ] , but it would be inaccurate to categorize their international approach as right-of-center or deferential to [LOC U.S.  ] positions . 
Dep . 
[PER Jungmann  ] ( [ORG PPS  ] ) and Dep . 
[PER Araujo  ] ( [ORG PSDB  ] ) both expressed strong support for [LOC Brazil  ] 's new position on climate change negotiations . 
The [ORG PSDB  ] and [ORG PPS  ] voted nearly in bloc to support the domestic legislation , signed into law by [PER Lula  ] on December 22 , committing [LOC Brazil  ] to make the emissions cuts that form the basis of its [LOC Copenhagen  ] proposal . 
[LOC DEM  ] , the most rightward of [LOC Brazil  ] 's major parties , expressed greater reservations , but Dep . 
[PER Ronaldo Caiado  ] ( [ORG Goias  ] ) , the party 's leader in the [LOC Chamber  ] , told poloff during the [MISC COP-15  ] negotiations that [LOC DEM  ] would not oppose any agreement reached in [LOC Copenhagen  ] . 
[PER Jungmann  ] anticipates that a prospective [LOC Serra  ] administration would still be in conflict with the [LOC U.S.  ] on some issues , with distinctions on trade , energy and ethanol assuming a higher profile while disagreements on [LOC Middle East  ] and [LOC Latin America  ] recede . 
The [ORG PSDB  ] and [ORG PPS  ] also have exhibited strong socially liberal streaks in their foreign policy statements , frequently criticizing [LOC Iran  ] and other authoritarian governments for their positions on gay rights , abortion , and other issues that the [ORG PT  ] is reluctant to address even domestically. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The opposition is working to project a foreign policy that , in the words of the policy advisor to Sen. [PER Joao Tenorio  ] ( [ORG PSDB-Alagoas  ] ) , is " both liberal and traditional . 
" Some tucano contacts , such as [PER Araujo  ] , emphasize the traditional . 
In his view , [ORG PSDB  ] should campaign to show that a [LOC Serra  ] win will move [LOC Brazil  ] back to its pre-2002 foreign policy stances , especially on [LOC Latin America  ] . 
He viewed [ORG PSDB  ] 's bloc vote against [LOC Venezuela  ] 's Mercosul accession as a primary case in point . 
Others , including [PER Jungmann  ] and [PER Tenorio  ] 's advisor , are careful to emphasize the " liberal , " acknowledging that [ORG PT  ] has a point when it says that [MISC Brazilians  ] enjoy seeing their government take an active role in international affairs because it speaks well of the country . 
In their view , promoting democracy and conflict resolution abroad and taking an aggressive stand on climate change are winning issues domestically , if carried out properly . 
The opposition 's challenge will be to expose the poor decisions and unhealthy alliances developed by [PER Lula  ] and the [ORG PT  ] in [LOC Honduras  ] , [LOC Iran  ] and elsewhere , in order to develop maximum advantage for [LOC Serra  ] in the campaign . 
Comment: How Important is This ? <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) It is questionable whether foreign policy will have a meaningful impact on public opinion and the election season . 
The [ORG PT  ] 's [ORG Pomar  ] correlated the spike in [PER Lula  ] 's activity on international issues with his subsequent recent rise in the polls while the [ORG PSDB  ] 's [PER Araujo  ] argued that the party 's position on [LOC Iran  ] helped turned the media against [PER Lula  ] and the [ORG PT  ] . 
Both may be right , but there 's no evidence that the voters who decide elections care much about [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , [PER Zelaya  ] and the like . 
In any case , all parties have to define themselves against their opposition in some fashion , and all indicators suggest that foreign policy will be the easiest way to do so . 
This is especially true for the [ORG PSDB  ] , which is reluctant to discuss economic issues given the electorate 's discomfort with [LOC Brazil  ] 's economic performance under former President [PER Fernando Henrique Cardoso  ] . 
Meanwhile , as distinctive foreign policy positions solidify over the next year , the stage will be set for either [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] or [PER Jose Serra  ] to take the next administration 's foreign policy in substantively very different directions .
