( C ) SUMMARY: The [ORG GOB  ] has started to backtrack on its negative and kneejerk response to the [ORG U.S.-Colombia Defense Cooperation Agreement  ] ( [ORG DCA  ] ) and appears open to conversations to set straight the disinformation campaign produced by [LOC Brazil  ] , s more left-leaning neighbors . 
After his August 6 meeting with [MISC Colombian  ] President [PER Uribe  ] , [MISC Brazilian  ] President [PER Lula  ] began mediating the tensions in the region set off by the [ORG DCA  ] and presented a moderate stance on the [MISC Colombian  ] bases during the [ORG Union of South American Nations  ] ( [ORG UNASUL  ] ) meeting in [LOC Quito  ] on August 10 and agreed to attend a summit in [LOC Bariloche  ] on August 28 . 
[ORG GOB  ] officials have been receptive to efforts by the [MISC Colombian  ] Ambassador in [LOC Brazil  ] to provide more information and transparency on the negotiations between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Colombia  ] and have expressed interest in the same engagement from [ORG USG  ] officials . 
In conversations with various senior [ORG USG  ] officials over the last two weeks , [ORG GOB  ] officials have consistently maintained that their primary interest in the region is stability . 
Adverse reaction to the [ORG DCA  ] demonstrates that there remains a significant degree of mistrust in [LOC Brazil  ] regarding [LOC U.S.  ] intentions in the region . 
End summary . 
[LOC BRAZIL  ] , S INITIAL RESPONSE ------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) The [ORG GOB  ] , s first reaction to the [ORG U.S.-Colombia Defense Cooperation Agreement  ] ( [ORG DCA  ] ) appeared to be based on a lack of information and fear that the [ORG DCA  ] was aimed at countering a threat from [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
In late July , [MISC Brazilian  ] President [PER Lula  ] said " I , m not happy with the idea of another [LOC U.S.  ] base in [LOC Colombia  ] " and Foreign Minister [PER Celso Amorim  ] told the press " what worries [LOC Brazil  ] is a strong military presence whose aim and capability seems to go well beyond what might be needed inside [LOC Colombia  ] . 
" There were news reports that [PER Amorim  ] was working with [LOC Spain  ] to coordinate a political effort from the [ORG EU  ] and [MISC Latin American  ] countries against the alleged expansion of a [LOC U.S.  ] military presence in [LOC Colombia  ] . 
Presidential Foreign Policy Advisor [PER Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] and [PER Amorim  ] complained to [ORG National Security Advisor General  ] [PER Jim Jones  ] during his August 4 visit to [LOC Brasilia  ] ( septel ) about the way the information and announcement of the [LOC U.S.  ] accord with [LOC Colombia  ] were being managed . 
[PER Garcia  ] highlighted the [LOC Amazon  ] as being [LOC Brazil  ] , s main concern because so often there is talk about internationalizing the rain forest . 
He , and several other [MISC Brazilian  ] officials , said that the tension in the region caused by the [ORG U.S.-Colombia DCA  ] puts [LOC Brazil  ] in a bad situation . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] media quickly seized on the rhetoric against the [ORG DCA  ] propagated by the more left-leaning elements in the region and [MISC Brazilian  ] government , fueling what the [MISC Colombians  ] have called a disinformation campaign . 
Many of the stories printed in [MISC Brazilian  ] press in late July and early August were sensationalist and based on little fact , mischaracterizing the bases as [LOC U.S.  ] bases and the accord as an attempt to militarize the region . 
[PER LULA  ] TAKES [PER URIBE  ] , S MESSAGE ON BOARD AND TO [ORG UNASUL  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) President [PER Uribe  ] , s whirlwind tour through [LOC Latin America  ] August 4-6 to explain the scope of the [ORG DCA  ] succeeded in allaying some of [LOC Brazil  ] 's fears ( [ORG REF  ] A ) . 
According to [ORG GOB  ] and [ORG GOC  ] statements to the [MISC Brazilian  ] press , [PER Lula  ] , [PER Amorim  ] , and Minister of Defense [PER Nelson Jobim  ] met with [PER Uribe  ] for two hours on August 6 , maintaining a positive tone throughout the meeting while expressing concerns over the use of [MISC Colombian  ] military bases by the [LOC United States  ] . 
[PER Lula  ] emphasized to [PER Uribe  ] the importance of working closely with all [MISC South American  ] countries to counter narcotrafficking , independent of " external intervention . 
" [PER Lula  ] also tried to convince [PER Uribe  ] to participate in the next [ORG Union of South American Nations  ] ( [ORG UNASUL  ] ) meeting to maintain an open dialogue over the bases . 
[PER Amorim  ] announced that the [ORG GOB  ] saw [PER Uribe  ] , s visit as a very positive gesture and recognized that [LOC Colombia  ] is a sovereign country with the right to negotiate the use of its air bases with the [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001041 002.2 OF 003 [LOC United States  ] . 
But he asked that the accord be negotiated " with transparency . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) PolOffs met August 18 with [MISC Colombian  ] Ambassador to [LOC Brazil  ] [PER Tony Jozame  ] , who incidacted that [PER Lula  ] took on board [PER Uribe  ] , s clarifications of the [ORG DCA  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] use of [LOC Colombia  ] air bases during [PER Uribe  ] , s August 6 visit to [LOC Brasilia  ] . 
[PER Jozame  ] noted that , following the discussions with [PER Uribe  ] , [PER Lula  ] proved very helpful to the [MISC Colombians  ] during the [ORG UNASUL  ] summit in [LOC Quito  ] by presenting a more moderate discourse and balancing [PER Chavez  ] , s rhetoric . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] media reported that [PER Lula  ] and [LOC Argentina  ] President [PER Cristina Kirchner  ] led an effort to prevent heated rhetoric regarding the [MISC U.S.-Colombia  ] military cooperation from dominating the summit . 
During the event , [PER Lula  ] called for a [ORG UNASUL  ] meeting with Presidents [PER Obama  ] and [PER Uribe  ] and noted the importance of hearing the views of [MISC Colombian  ] officials regarding the [LOC U.S.  ] presence in [LOC Colombia  ] . 
In great part to [PER Lula  ] , s moderating efforts , the [ORG UNASUL  ] declaration made no reference to the controversy surrounding the [MISC U.S.-Colombia  ] [ORG DCA  ] . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] ( [ORG MOD  ] ) contacts told EmbOffs that [PER Lula  ] did not stay until the end of the [ORG UNASUL  ] meeting because [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG MOD Nelson Jobim  ] prevailed on him not to , in an attempt to defuse the tension over the issue in [LOC Quito  ] . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] military officials have in recent weeks told [MISC Brazilian  ] press and [ORG USG  ] officials that they do not see the [ORG DCA  ] as a regional threat . 
[MISC COLOMBIAN  ] MISSION CAMPAIGNING ITS VIEWS ------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Uribe  ] told [MISC Brazilian  ] officials that he had tasked his ambassador in [LOC Brazil  ] to meet with the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Senate  ] to explain fully the [ORG DCA  ] and share with the [MISC Brazilians  ] the documents of the negotiations with the [LOC United States  ] . 
[PER Jozame  ] told the [LOC PollOff  ] that he had already met with several members of the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Congress  ] and was scheduled to meet with several other senior [MISC Brazilian  ] officials and [MISC Latin American  ] missions in [LOC Brasilia  ] to discuss the [ORG DCA  ] . 
[PER Jozame  ] also shared the documents he was sending to every [MISC Brazilian  ] member of [ORG Congress  ] , which included: a personal two-page letter from the Ambassador explaining the positive progress [LOC Colombia  ] has made in recent years in its partnership with the [LOC United States  ] to counter narcotrafficking , titled " [MISC Colombia:  ] Yesterday and Today ; " a two-page document outlining the objectives of the [ORG DCA  ] with the [LOC United States  ] ; and a two-page document with nine points explaining what the [ORG DCA  ] with the [LOC United States  ] is and seven points explaining what it is not , written in an effort to clarify the disinformation that has been published in the press and advocated by [LOC Venezuela  ] , s [PER Chavez  ] and others during the [ORG UNASUL  ] meeting . 
( Note: these documents have been sent to [ORG WHA/BSC  ] . 
End note . 
) [PER Jozame  ] said his clarifications were well received by [MISC Brazilian  ] members of [ORG Congress  ] and that he has invited [MISC Brazilian  ] officials to visit the [MISC Colombian  ] bases if they want to see it for themselves. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Jozame  ] suggested that [ORG USG  ] officials reach out to the [ORG GOB  ] as well to give them greater detail and information on the [ORG DCA  ] , to " clear the air , " and to counter misinformation . 
[PER Jozame  ] also welcomed the coordination of efforts and messages being given to the [MISC Brazilians  ] . 
[ORG PRESIDENCY ADVISOR EXPLAINS BRAZIL  ] , S REACTION -------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Foreign Policy Advisor Ambassador [PER Marcel Biato  ] explained [LOC Brazil  ] , s reaction to the [ORG DCA  ] in a meeting with the Charge on August 19 . 
He denied that it represented an effort to promote [ORG UNASUL  ] at the expense of the [LOC United States  ] . 
Rather , he said , [LOC Brazil  ] , s main interest is to maintain peace in the region and that putting the lid back on regional tensions required moving the [ORG GOB  ] , s public discourse to the middle of the debate ( i.e. , making statements critical of the [LOC United States  ] ) in order to maintain its ability to act as a mediator . 
[PER Biato  ] thought the [ORG USG  ] should understand well the context in which [LOC Brazil  ] is trying to work and would know not to react to negative statements . 
[PER Biato  ] described [PER Lula  ] , s meeting with [PER Uribe  ] as positive and said that [PER Lula  ] was reticent to attend the upcoming meeting in [LOC Bariloche  ] for fear it would stir up conflict again . 
As [PER Uribe  ] had agreed to go , however , [PER Lula  ] would attend . 
[LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001041 003.2 OF 003 COMMENT: STABILITY , LACK OF TRUST AT ISSUE ----------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [LOC Brazil  ] , s foreign policy in [LOC South America  ] is driven primarily by a desire for stability , as seen in its repeated assumption of a mediator role during crises and push for multilateral forums to facilitate communication and cooperation . 
[LOC Brasilia  ] , s negative reaction to the announcement of the [MISC U.S.-Colombia  ] [ORG DCA  ] was , in the first instance , a response to the tensions the [ORG DCA  ] ignited in the region and part of what [LOC Brasilia  ] saw as a pragmatic effort to dissolve the strain. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) In tandem with this fundamental concern , less pragmatic elements within the [PER Lula  ] government and [MISC Brazilian  ] media clearly have sought to exploit the [ORG DCA  ] incident to boost [LOC Brazil  ] , s leadership at the expense of the [LOC United States  ] . 
At the same time , the incident played on deep-seeded and broad-based suspicions of [LOC U.S.  ] intentions in [LOC South America  ] , based on the [MISC Brazilian  ] reading of past [LOC U.S.  ] intervention in the region . 
Taken together with [MISC Brazilian  ] concerns about the [MISC Fourth Fleet  ] and long-standing worries about losing the [LOC Amazon  ] , this latest incident has brought to the fore the low level of trust many [MISC Brazilians  ] have in the [LOC United States  ] , which is a key consideration as we seek to expand our bilateral partnership .
