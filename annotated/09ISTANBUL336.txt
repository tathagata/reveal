( C ) [ORG Summary:  ] A [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] businessman who represents the [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] company [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] shared with us a discussion he recently had with a [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] he described as close to [PER Rafsanjani  ] . 
The [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] claimed [PER Rafsanjani  ] told him Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] has terminal leukemia and is expected to die in months . 
As a result , [PER Rafsanjani  ] decided to stop challenging [PER Khamenei  ] , and instead is preparing the ground to have himself appointed [PER Khamenei  ] 's successor . 
If he succeeds he will dismiss [PER Ahmadinejad  ] and call for [LOC XXXXXXXa  ] new election , according to the [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
The [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told our contact there was a growing “invisible general strike” in [LOC Iran  ] , whereby hundreds of thousands of workers were going to work but not really working , to show their dismay at the election results . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) We met [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] with [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] recently returned from meetings in [LOC Tehran  ] with [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] executives , including a Board of Directors member named [LOC XXXXXXXXXXXX.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) According to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] is a strong [MISC Mousavi  ] supporter who expected to be a potential candidate for [ORG Minister of Industry  ] in a [MISC Mousavi  ] government . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] explicitly described the June 12 election results as massive fraud , a view he said was shared by almost all business executives and company directors throughout [LOC Iran  ] . 
He claimed the fraud was perpetrated by “six or seven [ORG Sepah  ] ( [ORG IRGC  ] ) Generals” who were afraid the [ORG IRGC  ] would be sidelined if [MISC Mousavi  ] won . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] asserted to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that he personally knew the director of information technology for the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] 's election supervision office . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] described this official as being involved in tabulating the vote count electronically [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that this official was promptly arrested by [ORG IRGC  ] security agents , jailed , and eventually executed . 
According to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , the real tabulation results showed [MISC Mousavi  ] winning 16 million votes in the first round , with [PER Karroubi  ] coming in second place and [PER Ahmadinejad  ] lagging in third . 
( Comment: These figures track with the supposedly genuine vote tally figures circulated after the election by pro-Mousavi supporters . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Khamenei  ] has cancer: [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that [PER Rafsanjani  ] remains vehemently opposed to [PER Ahmadinejad  ] but is biding his time because of a serious health crisis affecting Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei:  ] a terminal case of “blood cancer” ( leukemia ) . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that he heard from [PER Rafsanjani  ] that [PER Khamenei  ] is likely to die within a matter of months . 
As a result , [PER Rafsanjani  ] has stopped campaigning within the [ORG Assembly of Experts  ] to challenge [PER Khamenei  ] , and now is focused on “letting nature take its course.” Following the Supreme Leader 's passing , [PER Rafsanjani  ] will try to mobilize the [ORG Assembly of Experts  ] to appoint him as the new Supreme Leader . 
If he is successful – though clearly he would face stiff opposition from [PER Ahmadinejad  ] allies in that [ORG Assembly  ] – he would then invite [PER Ahmadinejad  ] to resign and call a new election . 
Because [PER Rafsanjani  ] , [MISC Mousavi  ] , and their close supports are anticipating this scenario , they are currently “laying low.” [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that he did not expect to see opposition leaders calling for any further demonstrations or provocative activities in coming months that might undercut [PER Rafsanjani  ] 's efforts to position himself as a future Supreme Leader. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) “Invisible” general strike: [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told him that a growing portion of the [MISC Iranian  ] workforce was [LOC ISTANBUL  ] 00000336 002 OF 003 engaged in an “invisible general strike” against the regime to protest the contested election result . 
He claimed that hundreds of thousands of [MISC Iranian  ] workers in all sectors ( public and private ) throughout the country had superficially resumed their pre-elections routines and habits . 
They were going to work every day , but once at work they were doing nothing or working at a bare minimum pace . 
The realization that such an “invisible strike” could hurt the regime almost as much as an overt general strike , but without the same risks , was spreading . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] predicted to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that [LOC Iran  ] 's manufacturing and industrial production levels , already strained , are starting to suffer even more precipitously as this effort becomes more widespread .

( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX Comment  ] —— <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] has proved to be a credible interlocutor in the past and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] favorably predisposed to the [LOC United States  ] . 
This is the first time he shared observations from the [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
We cannot independently assess the veracity of that information , but we note that rumors have long circulated that Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] has cancer and is in rapidly declining health . 
If true , [PER Khamenei  ] 's departure would indeed offer [PER Rafsanjani  ] a propitious opportunity to exert control over the appointment of a successor , though such an event would likely precipitate factional infighting extending well beyond the closed-door confines of the [ORG Assembly of Experts  ] . 
That [PER Rafsanjani  ] would be able to secure his own appointment as [LOC Iran  ] 's next Supreme [LOC ISTANBUL  ] 00000336 003 OF 003 Leader in the event of [PER Khamenei  ] 's near-term death is far from certain , and indeed is only one of many potential succession scenarios that could unfold . 
The observation about an “invisible general strike” is noteworthy , but we have not heard similar descriptions from other contacts ; we will query several [MISC Iran-based  ] contacts on it. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) As a businessman , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] 's primary motivation in pursuing deals with [MISC Iranian  ] companies is , of course , the profit motive . 
But [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] , he is a true believer in the idea that significantly expanding western commercial relations with [LOC Iran  ] would raise pressure on [MISC Iranian  ] companies ( and indirectly the [MISC Iranian  ] government ) to reform their economic behavior and modernize the way they do business , resulting – potentially – in a more moderately-behaved [LOC Iran  ] . 
From our perspective such a linkage is unlikely in the current political climate in [LOC Iran  ] .
