( C ) The [MISC Catholic  ] Church seeks to work under the [ORG GOC  ] 's radar to rebuild its infrastructure and ecclesiastical ranks . 
From Cardinal [PER Ortega  ] all the way down to provincial nuns , the Church mostly avoids challenging the [ORG GOC  ] . 
Fear of drawing the ire of the [ORG GOC  ] limits church outreach programs to narrow niches , such as caring for mentally challenged children and adults . 
Congregations for the most part remain small , elderly , and female . 
Youth programs are stunted , leading one to wonder who will fill the newly-renovated churches to listen to the priests who graduate from the huge seminary now under construction. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Over the past two months , [ORG COM  ] has had the opportunity to engage with elements of the [MISC Catholic  ] Church on a variety of levels , including with Cardinal [PER Ortega  ] , the auxiliary bishop of [LOC Havana  ] , the bishop of [LOC Santiago  ] , missionary nuns in [LOC Matanzas  ] province , and priests from nine [LOC Havana  ] parishes and one in [LOC Santiago  ] . 
The impression one takes away is of a church extremely unlikely to challenge the [ORG GOC  ] beyond even minimal ways . 
On issues large and small , [MISC Catholic  ] Church strategy is to capitulate to [ORG GOC  ] positions , preemptively if possible . 
Cardinal [PER Ortega  ] 's priority is to increase the ranks of priests and religious , renovate church buildings , and complete the new seminary . 
In this he has succeeded . 
The numbers of priests has risen over the past ten years from 140 up to 240 , and religious have doubled from 300 to 600 . 
Half of the priests and two-thirds of the religious are foreigners . 
Churches recently renovated , or undergoing renovation with assistance from overseas , are evident throughout [LOC Havana.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) You Always Have to Give [MISC Way: As  ] a nun with 26 years experience in [LOC Cuba  ] explained to us , one always gives way to the [ORG GOC  ] . 
Cardinal [PER Ortega  ] told the [ORG COM  ] much the same during their two hour meeting . 
These dynamics appear to hold on both the national and local levels . 
Whether Church real estate was taken by the [ORG GOC  ] before 1959 or afterwards , the Church is not seeking to recover it . 
When the seminarian ranks began to outgrow the capacity of their location in [LOC Havana  ] Vieja , the church maneuvered ( successfully ) during [PER Pope John Paul  ] II 's visit to gain permission to build a new seminary rather than recover its former building . 
Churches converted into museums and concert halls will remain that way . 
Rather than expressing rancor toward the [ORG GOC  ] , members of the [MISC Catholic  ] Church hierarchy expressed gratitude that the [ORG GOC  ] does not block funding from foreign foundations and other sources needed to build and restore Church buildings. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On the local level , the [MISC Catholic  ] Church pays great deference to [ORG GOC  ] strictures . 
Earlier this year , three missionary nuns in [LOC Matanzas  ] sought to add a guest room to their house for their Mother Superior to use on visits . 
After they acquired the building materials , local authorities refused permission to build . 
The materials remain stacked in the house 's interior courtyard . 
Population shifts within [LOC Havana  ] province have increased the need for new churches in areas such as Alamar , on the outskirts of [LOC USINT  ] , s travel limits . 
Absent [ORG GOC  ] approval for new construction , the [MISC Catholic  ] Church makes do with makeshift services in individual houses. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) And Then Came the [MISC Hurricanes:  ] The interaction between the [MISC Catholic  ] Church , including its relief arm , [ORG Caritas  ] , and the [ORG GOC  ] over hurricane relief issues is an interesting illustration of this deference . 
[ORG Caritas  ] initially accepted USD 80,000 in hurricane relief funding from [ORG OFDA  ] . 
Subsequently , [ORG Caritas  ] engaged in delicate negotiations with the [ORG GOC  ] on the terms under which it may import and distribute relief supplies . 
The [ORG GOC  ] for the first time agreed for [ORG Caritas  ] to import relief supplies and distribute them through [ORG Caritas  ] 's own distribution system . 
Most other churches distribute relief through the [ORG GOC  ] 's system , using [ORG GOC  ] transport , for which the [ORG GOC  ] takes credit . 
When the [ORG GOC  ] turned up the heat in recent weeks on all churches not to accept USG relief funds , [ORG Caritas  ] received instructions from the Church hierarchy here to cancel its agreement with [LOC USINT  ] for the [ORG OFDA  ] funds . 
[ORG Caritas  ] promptly did so . 
Elsewhere on relief efforts , at the parish level [ORG COM  ] has seen several parishes where the parish priest and laypersons went beyond the church hierarchy 's structure for hurricane relief and began direct parish-to-parish relief efforts . 
Such direct engagement bears watching and encouragement. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Lost Generation: Youth programs mostly are anemic , and church attendance by young people reflects this . 
The Bishop of [LOC Santiago  ] , [PER Juan Hernandez  ] , highlighted the difficulty of attracting children and adolescents whose parents are not churchgoers . 
Both [LOC Havana  ] and [LOC Santiago  ] dioceses offer catechism classes for minors , but attendance [ORG HAVANA  ] 00000811 002 OF 002 mostly appears sparse . 
A nun in [LOC Matanzas  ] looked back fondly on her time in [LOC Camaguey  ] , where she recalled a youth group of 75 or so . 
She found [LOC Matanzas  ] to be much more challenging . 
Both the bishops and Cardinal [PER Ortega  ] noted church youth programs could not be seen to compete with the [ORG GOC  ] 's own programs . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX runs a lunch program for his mostly poor parish in [LOC Santiago  ] , but disperses the meals among parish houses so as to attract less attention than would a large lunch at the church itself. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Migration is Killing Us: Almost all of [ORG COM  ] 's [MISC Catholic  ] Church interlocutors said migration was taking away many of their most educated and committed laypersons . 
Cardinal [PER Ortega  ] went further , noting that internal migration of non-Catholic [MISC Afro-Cubans  ] into [LOC Havana  ] had upset the " natural balance " in some of the poorer parishes in [LOC Havana  ] . 
Asked about Church outreach programs for these migrants , the Cardinal did not cite any and instead gave the impression he considered such programs would be wasted efforts. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Quiet Diplomacy: When asked about political prisoners , Cardinal [PER Ortega  ] said the [MISC Catholic  ] Church prefers to intercede with [ORG GOC  ] authorities behind the scenes . 
He views the Church as one of the few institutions able to intercede , albeit quietly , with the [ORG GOC  ] on such issues . 
It is difficult to judge how often , or how effective , is such intercession . 
Both Bishop [PER Hernandez  ] and [ORG Havana Auxiliary  ] Bishop [PER Garcia Ibanez  ] said access by priests to political prisoners is more frequent than it is to the larger population of those jailed for common crimes. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Comment: The [MISC Catholic  ] Church is by far the largest island-wide institution with even minimal autonomy from the [ORG GOC  ] ( the [MISC Methodists  ] enjoy some autonomy but their reach is much less extensive ) . 
From what [ORG COM  ] has observed thus far , however , decades of difficult Church-State relations have left their scars on the [MISC Catholic  ] Church . 
Cardinal [PER Ortega  ] is committed to a slow rebuilding of the [MISC Catholic  ] Church 's capacity . 
The [MISC Catholic  ] Church has neither the strength nor the inclination to challenge the [ORG GOC  ] beyond the occasional criticism when [ORG GOC  ] policies conflict with [LOC Vatican  ] doctrine on issues such as gay rights . 
Nor do [MISC Catholic  ] Church programs overall provide much material support to complement or substitute for [ORG GOC  ] programs . 
The [ORG GOC  ] means to keep it that way , and the [MISC Church  ] thus far has gone along . 
We will be watching to see whether experiences in providing hurricane relief over the coming months change that dynamic .
