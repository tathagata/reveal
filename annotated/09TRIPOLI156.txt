Cretz  ] , Ambassador , [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy - [LOC Tripoli  ] , [LOC U.S.  ] Dept of State . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: In their first meeting , [ORG Libyan National Security Adviser  ] [ORG Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi ( son of [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi ) and the Ambassador discussed issues relating to the bilateral relationship and his putative visit to [LOC Washington  ] in April . 
[ORG Muatassim  ] , initially nervous but cordial throughout , welcomed the Ambassador and said [LOC Libya  ] was looking for positive movement from the [LOC U.S.  ] , especially on selling equipment ( armaments ) and providing training to the military , as well as cooperation in the civilian nuclear field . 
[LOC Libya  ] had given up much , he argued , and it was time for the [LOC U.S.  ] to show some trust and confidence in the relationship . 
The Ambassador noted that the [ORG GOL  ] also needed to build up a trustworthy track record , especially with respect to commitments to fully dismantle its WMD programs and precursors . 
The Ambassador discussed actions the [ORG GOL  ] could take in the next several weeks in advance of [ORG Muatassim  ] 's proposed visit: facilitating a human rights dialogue , executing proposed [ORG Anti-Terrorism Assistance  ] ( [ORG ATA  ] ) training programs and supporting the Embassy 's efforts to purchase land for a [ORG New Embassy Compound  ] ( [ORG NEC  ] ) . 
Such measures , in addition to the positive step of having invited [ORG U.S. Africa Command  ] 's General [PER Ward  ] to visit ( currently scheduled for March 10-11 ) , would help pave the way for a successful [ORG Muatassim  ] visit . 
[ORG Muatassim  ] denounced the [ORG Human Rights Report  ] as unfair and rejected a role for [ORG NGOs  ] , asserting that relevant topics should remain in the government-to-government channel . 
He concluded by underscoring that a decision by the POTUS to meet with [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi at the upcoming [ORG G-8 Summit  ] in [LOC Sardinia  ] would be interpreted by the [ORG GOL  ] as a key signal of [LOC U.S.  ] intent with respect to further developing the bilateral relationship . 
End summary . 
2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The Ambassador met with [ORG National Security Adviser  ] ( [ORG NSA  ] ) [ORG Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi on February 17 for a little over an hour . 
At [ORG Muatassim  ] 's request , the Ambassador came alone while al-Qadhafi was accompanied by his assistant , [PER Hind Siala  ] , and MFA Secretary for the [ORG Americas  ] ( [ORG A/S-equivalent  ] ) [PER Ahmed Fituri  ] . 
[PER Al-Qadhafi  ] , uncharacteristically speaking in [MISC English  ] ( halting but passable ) , opened by welcoming the Ambassador and asking how the situation was in the [LOC U.S.  ] The Ambassador described the latest developments with respect to the economic stimulus bill . 
[PER Al-Qadhafi  ] asked if the [LOC USG  ] , in the midst of an economic crisis , would be able to focus on foreign affairs as well . 
The Ambassador noted the Secretary 's current trip to [LOC Asia  ] and the appointment of several special envoys as reflecting the new administration 's intent and ability to focus in earnest on international affairs . 
[PER Al-Qadhafi  ] asked when we might expect a visit by the Secretary . 
Ambassador said he had no information on the Secretary 's upcoming schedule and in any case it would be better to focus on al-Qadhafi 's expected visit to [LOC Washington  ] , notionally scheduled for late April . 
That visit would be an important opportunity to help the two sides chart their expectations of what " normal " bilateral [MISC U.S.-Libya  ] relations would mean . 
[ORG MUATASSIM  ] WANTS TO SIGN A [ORG TIFA  ] AND [ORG ECA  ] 3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG Muatassim  ] said he looked forward to signing a [ORG U.S-Libya Trade and Investment Framework Agreement  ] ( [ORG TIFA  ] ) and an Education and [MISC Cultural Protocol  ] during his visit . 
The [MISC Libyan  ] side had comments on the wording of the latter related to the [ORG GOL  ] 's rejection of language ascribing any role for [ORG NGOs  ] . 
[PER Al-Qadhafi  ] asserted that government-to-government contacts would be the appropriate channel for these issues and stressed that the [ORG GOL  ] would not countenance the " ... same situation as had been the case with [MISC Egyptian  ] [ORG NGOs  ] " . 
He launched into an impassioned argument against the annual [ORG Human Rights Report  ] ( [ORG HRR  ] ) , arguing it did not reflect the real situation and that it was inappropriate for the [LOC U.S.  ] to comment on the situation in [LOC Libya  ] or in the region , where different cultural norms obtained . 
" You should get rid of it [ the [ORG HRR  ] ] " , he said . 
Perhaps , he suggested , the [ORG GOL  ] should ask its embassy-equivalent in [LOC Washington  ] to critique the human rights situation in the [LOC U.S.  ] The Ambassador answered that the report was [MISC Congressionally-mandated  ] and that there were strict criteria embassies worldwide followed in preparing it . 
[PER Al-Qadhafi  ] was taken aback when he learned that various domestic and international organizations regularly report on and criticize human rights issues in the [LOC U.S.  ] such as prison conditions . 
[LOC LIBYA  ] KEEN ON BROAD SECURITY AGREEMENT AND SECURITY ASSURANCES 4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG Muatassim  ] said [LOC Libya  ] was keen to obtain broad security guarantees from the [LOC U.S.  ] The Ambassador stressed that the kind of overarching document he sought was not feasible ; however , the [LOC U.S.  ] was prepared to consider separate agreements that would encompass the various areas of cooperation envisioned by the [ORG GOL  ] draft and would be willing to revisit the possibility of incorporating security language in a joint communique that could [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000156 002 OF 003 be issued in connection with [ORG Muatassim  ] 's visit . 
( Note: The [ORG GOL  ] raised a broad security agreement and language on security assurances in advance of the Secretary 's visit in September 2008 and in the run-up to a proposed visit by [ORG Muatassim  ] to [LOC Washington  ] in January 2009 . 
End note . 
) [ORG Muatassim  ] repeatedly asked why the [LOC U.S.  ] was reluctant to provide training and weaponry to [LOC Libya  ] , especially after the [ORG GOL  ] had abandoned its WMD programs . 
[LOC Libya  ] was " embarrassed " when asked by [LOC North Koreans  ] and [MISC Iranians  ] , who might potentially be looking to do the same thing , what they had received for having taken such a major step . 
[LOC Libya  ] was a key partner in the fight against terrorism , but [ORG GOL  ] officials were puzzled that the [LOC U.S.  ] still did not seem to really trust [LOC Libya  ] 's intentions . 
[LOC Libya  ] would prefer to receive equipment and training from the [LOC U.S.  ] ; however , if that was not possible , the [ORG GOL  ] would turn to other sources . 
The Ambassador replied that trust needed to be built up on both sides and that such a relationship might take some time to develop . 
STEPS [LOC LIBYA  ] COULD TAKE TO ESTABLISH TRUST AND A TRACK RECORD 5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Turning the discussion back to [ORG Muatassim  ] 's [LOC Washington  ] visit , the Ambassador suggested that [LOC Libya  ] could profitably take several steps now in the run-up to the visit to establish such trust . 
The invitation to [ORG U.S. Africa Command  ] 's General [PER Ward  ] to visit [LOC Libya  ] in March was a good start . 
[ORG Muatassim  ] said the [ORG GOL  ] looked forward to the visit and that he hoped to schedule a meeting for General [PER Ward  ] with [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi and Secretary of the [ORG Temporary Defense Committees  ] ( Minister of [LOC Defense-equivalent  ] ) [PER Abu Bakr Younis  ] . 
The [ORG GOL  ] remains skeptical of [ORG U.S. Africa Command  ] 's intentions and would look for [PER Ward  ] to provide a definitive sketch of what he and his organization planned to do . 
6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The Ambassador continued that [LOC Libya  ] could also take another step by inviting a team from [LOC Washington  ] to commence the much-discussed high-level human rights dialogue . 
Full implementation of its commitments to give up [ORG WMD  ] and [ORG WMD  ] precursors , to include facilitating the return of spent highly-enriched reactor fuel to [LOC Russia  ] , would constitute an important signal of [LOC Libya  ] 's willingness to adhere to promises . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] was aware of [LOC Libya  ] 's keen interest in pursuing civilian nuclear cooperation ; however , there were those in the [LOC U.S.  ] who doubted [LOC Libya  ] 's intentions . 
Signing the government-to-government agreement that was required to facilitate the return of spent reactor fuel from [LOC Libya  ] to [LOC Russia  ] as agreed under the [ORG Trilateral Steering and Coordination Committee  ] ( [ORG TSC  ] ) would be an important step on the road to changing the minds of those who held such views . 
[ORG Muatassim  ] responded that on civilian nuclear and military-to-military cooperation , [LOC Libya  ] expected that the steps that it had already taken warranted positive cooperation from the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" There is trust or there is not trust " , he said . 
Finally , the Ambassador said the [ORG GOL  ] needed to decide whether to accept [ORG Anti-Terrorism Assistance  ] ( [ORG ATA  ] ) training , which required submitting the names of proposed trainees for [PER Leahy  ] vetting . 
( Note: On the eve of an upcoming land border security training program , the [ORG GOL  ] balked at providing names , arguing that such vetting was " inappropriate " and signaled a " lack of trust " . 
End note . 
) The Ambassador said he was aware of [MISC Libyan  ] sensitivities , but we had to adhere to the vetting process , which was required of all countries . 
7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Support from the [ORG GOL  ] for the Embassy 's effort to purchase land for a [ORG NEC  ] would constitute another positive signal , the Ambassador said . 
[PER Al-Qadhafi  ] replied that there were historical sensitivities about this issue . 
There was no way [LOC Libya  ] could agree to a " large office building on seven hectares of land " . 
Such a facility would remind [MISC Libyans  ] of the [LOC U.S.  ] at [LOC Wheelus Air Base  ] years before and be a magnet for demonstrations when , for example , crises periodically erupted over [LOC Israel  ] 's treatment of [MISC Palestinians  ] . 
The issue was " not personal , " [ i.e. , specifically directed against the [LOC U.S  ] . 
] he said . 
No mission in [LOC Libya  ] , including those of [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC China  ] , had been permitted to construct such an edifice . 
The Ambassador stressed that we were looking for four hectares , and that the building design would take into account the local culture and environment as well as meet strict standards of security . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] was looking toward a normal relationship with [LOC Libya  ] ; if that came to be , we would need more staff and a larger space . 
The new embassy would reflect the new relationship . 
[PER Al-Qadhafi  ] said he would like to look at the intended design . 
The Ambassador replied the building had yet to be designed , but perhaps he could see if there was a general sketch of what it might look like . 
AL-QADHAFI-POTUS MEETING WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT SIGNAL [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000156 003 OF 003 8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Concluding , al-Qadhafi said he hoped President [PER Obama  ] would be able to meet the Leader during the July [MISC G-8  ] session in [LOC Sardinia  ] . 
For [LOC Libya  ] , such a meeting would be a critical signal that a page had truly been turned in the relationship . 
It would also be an important gesture in light of [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi 's recent election as Chairman of the [ORG African Union  ] . 
The Ambassador undertook to convey the request to [LOC Washington  ] . 
9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Comment: This , the first meeting between the Ambassador and [ORG Muatassim  ] , went as well as could have reasonably been expected . 
After some initial nervousness , [ORG Muatassim  ] seemed to relax and take on board our point about the need for [LOC Libya  ] ( and himself ) not to focus solely on signing agreements but to build a track record prior to his planned visit . 
MFA A/S-equivalent Fituri subsequently called the DCM to say that he believed the chemistry was very good and that [ORG Muatassim  ] had been pleased with the meeting . 
Notwithstanding the goodwill and past engagement with the [ORG GOL  ] , it is clear that [ORG Muatassim  ] 's expectations with respect to military-to-military cooperation and security aspects of the relationship ( to include a comprehensive agreement that incorporates security assurances ) remain unreasonably high . 
The extent to which such expectations reflect the broader will of the regime is unclear ; however , the suggestion that a meeting between the POTUS and [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi at the [MISC G-8  ] would be an important signal likely represents a broader [ORG GOL  ] aspiration . 
End comment .
