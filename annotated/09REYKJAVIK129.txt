( [ORG U  ] ) Summary: [LOC Iceland  ] is swiftly moving forward with the [ORG EU  ] membership process and accession could come as early as 2012 . 
The issue remains contentious in [LOC Iceland  ] with current popular opinion reportedly split down the middle . 
Ultimately , the decision will likely come down to a national referendum that could take place in late 2011 or early 2012 . 
Organizations on both sides of the argument are already trying to get out in front of the issue and influence the public well in advance of the referendum . 
End Summary . 
The Process --------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) When [LOC Iceland  ] 's Foreign Minister , [PER Ossur Skarphedinsson  ] , presented his country 's official application for [ORG EU  ] membership in [LOC Sweden  ] on July 23 , it commenced a lengthy process that likely won't conclude until late 2012 or early 2013 . 
The first hurdle was overcome on July 27 when the foreign ministers of the twenty-seven [ORG EU  ] member states discussed the issue at a meeting of the General Affairs and [ORG External Relations Council  ] in [LOC Brussels  ] . 
The [ORG Council  ] had no objections to [LOC Iceland  ] 's [ORG EU  ] application and sent the matter on to the [ORG European Commission  ] for further study . 
The [ORG Commission  ] , which is comprised of twenty-seven commissioners who are bound to support the interests of the [ORG EU  ] rather than their home states , will review [LOC Iceland  ] 's candidacy based upon its ability to fulfill the [LOC Copenhagen  ] criteria--a series of measures that assess a candidate country 's ability to adhere to the political , economic and monetary requirements of the [ORG EU.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [ORG Commission  ] then turns its completed report over to the [ORG European Council  ] , which is comprised of the heads of state or government of the [ORG EU  ] 's member states along with the President of the [ORG European Commission  ] . 
The [ORG Council  ] must unanimously agree to grant [LOC Iceland  ] the status of an applicant country . 
A meeting of the [ORG European Council  ] is scheduled for December and it is possible that [LOC Iceland  ] 's candidacy could be voted on at that time . 
If the [ORG European Council  ] grants [LOC Iceland  ] candidate status , then accession negotiations will probably begin shortly thereafter in early 2010 . 
The negotiating process could take up to three years , but will likely be shorter since [LOC Iceland  ] has already adopted much of the [ORG EU  ] 's laws and regulations through its membership in the [ORG European Economic Area  ] ( [ORG EEA  ] ) agreement and its status as a [LOC Schengen  ] country . 
Once the negotiations are complete , a treaty of accession will be signed , which must be ratified by each individual [ORG EU  ] member state , as well as the parliaments of the [ORG EU  ] and [LOC Iceland.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Before [LOC Iceland  ] 's parliament approves this final treaty , however , [LOC Iceland  ] intends to hold a referendum on the subject , probably in 2011 or 2012 . 
The referendum process is expected to be a contentious affair as current public opinion on the issue is split . 
Media sources are currently reporting that about forty percent of the population is pro-European and an equal percentage is against the proposal with the remaining twenty percent undecided . 
Referendums under the parliamentary constitution are not legally binding , but the [MISC Icelandic  ] government has stated that the " will of the people " would ultimately determine if [LOC Iceland  ] enters into the [ORG EU  ] . 
The [ORG Pro-European Argument  ] --------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Pro-European  ] groups are already mobilizing in an attempt to influence public opinion , well in advance of the referendum . 
EmbOffs met on July 23 with two leading members of an organization named the [ORG European Movement  ] , which is emerging as one of the main pro-Europe voices in the debate . 
They were both quick to stress that [LOC Iceland  ] , following the bank collapse last October , desperately needs the stability that [ORG EU  ] membership can provide . 
Specifically , they said , the [MISC Euro  ] was needed because it would bring stability through lower interest rates , lower food prices , lower mortgage prices , and less inflation. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) They said that most of the supporters for entry into the [ORG EU  ] are comprised of educated professionals in the higher income brackets . 
They also suggested that basically all industries , except for the fishery and agriculture sectors , support [ORG EU  ] membership . 
Interestingly , younger people , who historically have supported [ORG EU  ] membership , seem to currently be gravitating away from that view . 
This greatly disappointed and perplexed them and they posited that perhaps the anti-European groups were utilizing technology more effectively than their organization . 
The anti-European message , they suggested , can more easily be condensed into a few words and is therefore more digestible to younger people via [ORG SMS  ] and Twitter . 
They said that their organization intends to adjust its tactics and will make young people a prime target of their education campaign. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) They also expressed their belief that the controversial [ORG Icesave  ] issue needs to be resolved before the [ORG EU  ] process can gain [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000129 002 OF 002 any real traction . 
( Note: A bill is currently being debated in the [MISC Icelandic  ] Parliament which would guarantee the repayment of billions of dollars to citizens from [LOC Britain  ] and the [LOC Netherlands  ] who held [MISC Icelandic  ] accounts prior to the banking collapse in October . 
End Note . 
) They said that despite politicians' claims to the contrary , there is a definite connection between the need to pass the [ORG Icesave  ] bill and [LOC Iceland  ] 's quest for [ORG EU  ] membership . 
[LOC Iceland  ] , they said , will not have any credibility in the eyes of the [ORG EU  ] unless it steps up to the plate and takes responsibility for the [ORG Icesave  ] debt . 
The [ORG Anti-European Argument  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The anti-European movement is also strongly working to get out its message . 
EmbOffs met on July 24 with a spokesperson for a group called [ORG Global Perspective  ] which appears poised to become the main opposition voice in the debate over [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG EU  ] membership . 
He said that the primary drawback to joining the [ORG EU  ] for [LOC Iceland  ] is the loss of sovereignty and independence . 
He also suggested that the [MISC Icelandic  ] fishing industry would be damaged irreparably by joining the [ORG EU  ] . 
The [ORG EU  ] , in his opinion , is likely to abolish the 200 nautical mile fishing zone that [LOC Iceland  ] has established , effectively opening up [LOC Iceland  ] 's territorial waters to fishing by other countries . 
Even if [LOC Iceland  ] were able to hold on to its territorial waters through negotiation , the [ORG Global Perspective  ] spokesperson felt that [ORG EU  ] rules would be so restrictive , dictating even what type of fishing lines [MISC Icelandic  ] fishermen can use , that the fishing industries would be crippled. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Joining the [ORG EU  ] , he added , would also be the death knell to the agricultural sector in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
The [ORG EU  ] , he said , would likely force [LOC Iceland  ] to do away with the government subsidies and protectionist tariffs that keep [MISC Icelandic  ] agricultural products from becoming prohibitively expensive . 
Without this government support , he claimed , over 70 percent of [MISC Icelandic  ] farmers would go out of business . 
This statistic was true , he said , even if [LOC Iceland  ] is able to negotiate a deal similar to what [LOC Finland  ] achieved in which it had been able to keep some government subsidies in place for agricultural goods grown above a latitude of 62 degrees--an exemption provided by the [ORG EU  ] in acknowledgment that farmers operating in such northern climates are at a significant disadvantage as compared to their [MISC European  ] counterparts who work in more temperate climes. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Ultimately , he felt that [LOC Iceland  ] would follow a path similar to [LOC Norway  ] , where voters have twice voted against membership in major [MISC European  ] institutions in national referendums ( Note: [LOC Norway  ] voted against the [ORG EC  ] in 1972 and against [ORG EU  ] membership in 1994 . 
End Note . 
) He felt that negotiations would go slowly and that [ORG EU  ] fatigue would set in with the [MISC Icelandic  ] population . 
The process could slow down even further , he suggested , due to the bureaucracy of the [ORG EU  ] , specifically because there will be a new [ORG European Commission  ] this year . 
This [ORG Commission  ] , he suggested , may be unable to complete its work in time for the vote by the [ORG European Council  ] in December. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: [LOC Iceland  ] is a fiercely independent nation that has long cherished its autonomy . 
However , the banking crisis was a serious jolt to this insular society and has made the once unthinkable idea of [ORG EU  ] membership a very real possibility . 
A final decision on the matter is several years down the road and will likely depend on [LOC Iceland  ] 's economic situation at that time . 
While much press has centered on the possibility of fast-tracking [MISC Icelandic  ] accession into the [ORG EU  ] , the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] was quick to note that accession by 2012 would be " ambitious , and a best-case scenario . 
" If a near term positive economic recovery takes place , [ORG Icelanders  ] may be quick to see the banking crisis as a blip on the screen and revert to their more autonomous tendencies . 
If the hard times linger , however , [ORG EU  ] membership may be a much more realistic possibility . 
Polling after the economic crisis hit in October 2008 showed a high degree of support for immediate entry into the [ORG EU  ] ; current polls have seen significantly reduced support for [ORG EU  ] accession. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Support for entering into negotiations for [LOC Iceland  ] 's accession into the [ORG EU  ] does not necessarily mean that [ORG Icelanders  ] support its ultimate entry . 
Many [ORG Icelanders  ] are interested in seeing what kind of deal can be negotiated with the [ORG EU  ] , but are not going to accept just any proposal that is put forward . 
Although [ORG Icelanders  ] are attracted to the stability that the [MISC Euro  ] would provide , many are unwilling to make tough concessions in the fishing and agriculture industries . 
As a result , the battle over the [ORG EU  ] accession has only just begun .
