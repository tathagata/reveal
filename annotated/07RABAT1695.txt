( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] The [MISC Moroccan  ] government is reacting strongly to the announced visit of [MISC Spanish  ] King [PER Juan Carlos  ] to the disputed enclaves of [LOC Ceuta  ] and [LOC Melilla  ] . 
Following blistering criticism of the intended visit by PM [PER El-Fassi  ] and Information Minister [PER Naciri  ] , the [ORG GOM  ] announced in the afternoon of November 2 that it was recalling its Ambassador in [LOC Madrid  ] for consultations . 
A senior [ORG MFA  ] official we spoke with expressed exasperation over the development but implied that the relationship would weather the storm . 
A [MISC Spanish  ] diplomat told us they had received a similar message of anger mixed with resignation from their [ORG MFA  ] contacts . 
Despite the public flash of anger , we doubt the incident will do sustained damage to the relationship . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Moroccan  ] government did not take lying down news that [MISC Spanish  ] King [PER Juan Carlos  ] and Queen [LOC Sofia  ] were planning their first visit to [LOC Ceuta  ] and [LOC Melilla  ] , the [MISC Spanish  ] enclaves on the [MISC Mediterranean  ] coast claimed by [LOC Morocco  ] . 
( We understand both enclaves will be visited November 5 , with no overnight stop . 
) Prime Minister [PER El-Fassi  ] late on November 1 expressed " deep regret " at the decision and warned it would impact the bilateral relationship . 
Information Minister ( and government spokesman ) [PER Khalid Naciri  ] told local media on November 1 that the [ORG GOM  ] rejected the visit and was very disappointed by the decision . 
Speaking on pan-Arab [MISC Al-Jazeera  ] TV , [PER Naciri  ] warned " the [MISC Spanish  ] government must understand there are red lines not to be crossed . 
" [MISC Moroccan  ] independent media also had an angry , nationalistic reaction . 
The wide circulation Al-Massae criticized the [MISC Spanish  ] monarch for violating tradition and " implementing the occupation " of the enclaves. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Youssef Amrani  ] , Director-General for Bilateral Affairs and the third ranking diplomat at the [MISC Moroccan  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] , told [MISC PolCouns  ] during a November 2 meeting that the [MISC Spanish  ] decision was " not astute " and " disturbed the atmosphere " between the two countries . 
He noted that [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC Morocco  ] had been undergoing several years of improved ties and confidence building , manifested most recently by Crown [PER Prince Felipe  ] 's late October visit , which generated positive coverage in [MISC Moroccan  ] media . 
[PER Amrani  ] implied that the relationship was durable enough to weather the storm. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Similarly , a [MISC Spanish  ] diplomat told [MISC PolCouns  ] on November 2 that he had discussed the issue with a senior contact at the [ORG MFA  ] . 
Heated complaints from the [MISC Moroccan  ] side were followed by assurances that bilateral cooperation would continue as usual . 
Asked why King [PER Juan Carlos  ] had chosen to break with tradition and conduct the visit , the [MISC Spaniard  ] noted that the King has been under domestic political pressure on a variety of issues from all sides , particularly the right wing . 
This pressure may have prompted the King to conduct a muscular gesture , he speculated. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) News that [LOC Morocco  ] was " indefinitely " recalling its Ambassador in [LOC Madrid  ] for consultations broke on the afternoon of November 2 . 
A ( separate ) [MISC Spanish  ] diplomat told [MISC D/PolCouns  ] his Embassy was taken by surprise by the decision . 
He noted that Vice President [PER Maria Teresa Fernandez De La Vega  ] had insisted after a Council of [LOC Ministers  ] meeting on November 2 that the King [PER Juan Carlos'  ] visit should not have an impact on [LOC Spain  ] 's relations with [LOC Morocco  ] . 
News of the withdrawal of [LOC Morocco  ] 's Ambassador appeared to belie this hope , our [MISC Spanish  ] contact opined. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Comment: We assess that the [ORG GOM  ] felt it had to react loudly and publicly to [PER Juan Carlos'  ] visit . 
Whatever its intended purpose , the visit was bound to irritate [LOC Morocco  ] , which continues to claim the enclaves . 
We also assess that this angry public reaction will not impact the underlying calculus behind [LOC Morocco  ] 's robust cooperation with [LOC Spain  ] , and this incident will not cause sustained damage to their bilateral relationship .
