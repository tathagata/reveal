[ORG SANTIAGO  ] 851 [ORG Classified By: Political Counselor  ] Stephen [PER M. Liston  ] , Reason 1.4 ( b ) an d ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) PolCounselor delievered ref A demarche September 19 to Ambassador [PER Marcel Biato  ] , foreign policy advisor at the [MISC Brazilian  ] presidency ( [LOC Planalto  ] ) . 
[PER Biato  ] asked if the decision to expel the [MISC Bolivian  ] and [MISC Venezuelan  ] ambassadors to the [LOC U.S.  ] was " considered " or " reciprocal . 
" PolCouns responded the decision was taken reluctantly , and intended both to be proportional and to show that expulsions of our Ambassadors were not taken lightly . 
[PER Biato  ] commended the [LOC U.S.  ] decision to avoid negative rhetoric and , over the course of the discussion , indicated that the GOB understands that both [MISC Bolivian  ] President [PER Morales  ] and [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Chavez  ] are using the expulsion and broader complaints against the [LOC United States  ] for their own political purposes . 
He pointed to the fact that this week 's [ORG UNASUL  ] declaration ( ref B ) had avoided any anti-US rhetoric as an indication that there was little support for view the [LOC United States  ] was to blame for the conflict . 
Commenting on [PER Lula  ] 's September 17 remark to the effect that [PER Morales  ] 's expulsion of the [LOC U.S.  ] ambassador was appropriate " if he had met with the opposition , " [PER Biato  ] insisted that [PER Lula  ] was using " shorthand " and of course meant that such an expulsion would only be appropriate if the ambassador had become involved in internal politics . 
[PER Biato  ] added that [MISC Brazilian  ] officials are clear when they visit [LOC Bolivia  ] that they will be meeting with [MISC Bolivian  ] officials on both sides of the divide . 
In accusing the [LOC U.S.  ] ambassador , he said , [PER Morales  ] was simply looking for an excuse. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Biato  ] said that [ORG UNASUL  ] had been the unexpected winner from the [LOC Bolivia  ] crisis , after what [LOC Brazil  ] considered a successful outcome from the emergency meeting September 15 in [LOC Santiago  ] . 
He confirmed that President [PER Lula  ] had offered [PER Morales  ] assistance from the " Group of Friends " when they spoke the week of September 8 . 
However , after they had lined up [LOC Argentina  ] and a reluctant [LOC Colombia  ] , the [MISC Bolivians  ] had done an about-face and rejected a mission . 
This was why [PER Lula  ] had only agreed to go to the [ORG UNASUL  ] meeting when [PER Morales  ] confirmed his attendance . 
According to [PER Biato  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] had rejected requests by [MISC Bolivian  ] opposition leaders to be present at the [ORG UNASUL  ] meeting . 
In [LOC Brazil  ] 's view , it was essential for [PER Morales  ] to have an expression of full support for constitutional government , so as not to give [PER Morales  ] any excuse for not negotiating . 
[PER Lula  ] had exercised " strategic patience " as [PER Chavez  ] took the floor first and spoke for an hour , steering the conversation away from anti-U.S. rhetoric and toward providing support for [PER Morales  ] . 
Concerned that the meeting might either be seen as interference in [LOC Bolivia  ] 's internal affairs or provide an excuse for regional intervention , [PER Lula  ] had insisted that [PER Morales  ] be asked what support he needed . 
Behind the scenes , [PER Biato  ] said , [LOC Brazil  ] has pushed [PER Morales  ] to the negotiating table , and the arrival of a delegation from [LOC Brasilia  ] in [LOC La Paz  ] on September 19 , as well as the presence of [MISC Brazilian  ] embassy officials at the talks in [LOC Cochabamba  ] , is intended to send a message of support for continued dialogue . 
[MISC Chilean  ] Ambassador Praises [MISC Brazilian  ] Performance at [ORG UNASUL  ] --------------------------------------------- ------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [MISC Chilean  ] Ambassador to [LOC Brazil  ] [PER Alvaro Diaz  ] told poloff September 18 that the [ORG UNASUL  ] emergency meeting in [LOC Santiago  ] produced a very positive outcome because it committed the [PER Morales  ] government to negotiate with the opposition , the declaration did not mention the [LOC U.S.  ] , and [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Hugo Chavez  ] was not allowed to dominate to meeting . 
He noted that [LOC Brazil  ] , s non-interventionist stance had helped depressurize the situation and the [ORG USG  ] also acted correctly by not inflaming the atmosphere . 
[PER Diaz  ] also said [MISC Colombian  ] President [PER Alvaro Uribe  ] had played a very important role toward the success of the [LOC Santiago  ] meeting. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Commenting on [MISC Brazilian  ] non-interventionism , [PER Diaz  ] said [LOC Brazil  ] , s current policy is in stark contrast to the interventionist policies of the [MISC Brazilian  ] military dictatorship , and probably is a direct result of it . 
Poloff noted that the [ORG USG  ] encourages the GOB to assume greater [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001253 002 OF 002 leadership responsibilities , but the GOB is reluctant to take the controversial stances that go with leadership . 
[PER Diaz  ] replied that [LOC Brazil  ] cannot assume leadership alone in the region , it must have partners , which would naturally be [LOC Argentina  ] and [LOC Colombia  ] , just as [LOC Germany  ] and [LOC France  ] are essential to each other in [LOC Europe  ] . 
As a result , [LOC Brazil  ] must continue to act in harmony with them and other regional players .
