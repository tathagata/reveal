Summary: ( C ) President [PER Karzai  ] has appointed a new mayor of [LOC Kabul  ] , Engineer [PER Mohammad Yunos Novandish  ] . 
This follows the December 7 , 2009 'm ismanagement of authority' conviction and the December 8 , 2009 release pending appeal of former [LOC Kabul  ] Mayor [PER Abdul Ahad Sahebi  ] ( Reftel . 
) The [PER Novandish  ] appointment portends controversy because he is not from [LOC Kabul  ] ; the [PER Sahebi  ] case suggests kangaroo court justice . 
Bio information on [PER Novandish  ] is in paras 3 and 4 . 
End Summary. -------------------- New Mayor - Old Ties -------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) President [PER Karzai  ] issued a January 3 decree appointing Engineer [PER Mohammad Yunos Novandish  ] the new mayor of [LOC Kabul  ] . 
Controversy over the appointment may arise for two reasons: First , according to [ORG Article  ] 141 of the Constitution , mayors shall be elected , not appointed . 
Some [MISC Afghan  ] MPs went on TOLO TV January 5 to challenge the appointment on constitutional grounds . 
Second , according to embassy contacts among the [ORG National Democratic Front  ] ( [ORG NDF  ] ) , Mayor [PER Novandish  ] is not a native [PER Kabuli  ] and the [ORG NDF  ] is planning to try and organize protests within the month . 
( Note: The [ORG NDF  ] is a loosely organized coalition of urban civil society groups and members of parliament . 
) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) According to media reports and embassy contacts , [PER Novandish  ] , an [MISC Uzbek  ] from [LOC Saripol  ] , graduated from the engineering faculty of [ORG Kabul Polytechnic University  ] in civil engineering and did post-graduate studies in the [LOC Ukraine  ] . 
He served as a lecturer at [ORG Balkh University  ] from 1994 to 1996 , lived primarily in [LOC Central Asia  ] during the [ORG Taliban  ] years , and was Deputy Minister of [LOC Water  ] and Energy from 2004-2006 . 
[PER Novandish  ] resigned his post when [PER Ismail Khan  ] was appointed Minister of [LOC Water  ] and Energy . 
After 2006 he worked as a consultant for USAID-funded programs such as [ORG International Development Relief and Development  ] , [ORG Inc  ] . 
( [ORG IRD  ] ) and [ORG Advanced Engineering Institute Associates  ] ( [ORG AEIA  ] ) . 
In 2009 he opened his own engineering firm , Energy and [ORG Power Construction Company  ] , which has allegedly done extensive subcontracting work in the energy sector . 
( Note: alternate transliterations of his name include [MISC Noandesh  ] , [MISC Novandesh  ] , and [MISC Nawandaish  ] . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S/NF ) Sensitive reporting indicates that warlord and leader of the [ORG Junbesh Party General Dostum  ] pushed [PER Novandish  ] for the [LOC Kabul  ] Mayor appointment . 
Although [PER Novandish  ] claims publicly that he is politically independent , this reported [PER Dostum  ] support has credibility given that [PER Novandish  ] was Deputy Minister of [LOC Water  ] and Energy when current [ORG MP  ] and [ORG Junbesh Party  ] member [PER Shakar Kargar  ] ( [MISC Uzbek  ] , [LOC Jowzjan  ] ) was Minister . 
[PER Kargar  ] reportedly owed his own ministerial appointment at that time to [PER Dostum  ] . 
Although [PER Kargar  ] is an intra-party rival of [PER Dostum  ] , they often unite to further party interests . 
[PER Dostum  ] has been publicly vocal in his criticism of the January 2 ministerial confirmation process in which all three [MISC Junbesh  ] nominees were rejected . 
The appointment of an apparent [PER Dostum  ] supporter to the mayor 's office may well be President [PER Karzai  ] 's attempt to placate [PER Dostum  ] and [LOC Junbesh.  ] ---------------------------- Old Mayor - Yesterday 's News ---------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Media coverage of the new mayor 's appointment has included condemnation of his predecessor , [PER Abdul Ahad Sahebi  ] , for " massive embezzlement of funds and brazen misuse of authority . 
" The ex-mayor 's December 7 conviction and almost immediate release from jail on bail pending appeal generated a media frenzy and intense speculation over President [PER Karzai  ] 's role in [PER Sahebi  ] 's release . 
( Reftel . 
) [ORG USG  ] officials met with [PER Sahebi  ] on December 25 , 2009 and January 2 and 3 , <a id='par2010' href='#par2010'>¶</a>2010 . 
[PER Sahebi  ] produced the December 6 summons he received to appear at primary court and obtain a date for his preliminary hearing . 
[PER Sahebi  ] contended that normal procedure requires a minimum of 5 days between summons and hearing date , but when he presented himself to the court on December 7 , his lawyer was handed not a hearing date , but his sentence - four years in jail and a [MISC USD  ] 16,000 fine. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Concerning the actual charge of poor oversight of contracting authority , [PER Sahebi  ] laid out his version of the case: In 2007 [PER Sahebi  ] 's predecessor signed a one-year contract leasing some city property to two individuals who had shops on the site . 
When the contract came up for renewal , the [ORG City Hall  ] financial department assigned three people to study the continued use of the land . 
The financial department recommended the contract be renewed , with mention of the city 's future plans for the site . 
[PER Sahebi  ] 's deputy [LOC KABUL  ] 00000062 002.2 OF 002 signed the renewal . 
Three months later , a higher bid for the site came in . 
Had that bid been accepted , the city would have gained about [MISC USD  ] 16,000 more for the lease and this " loss " was the basis of the case against him . 
Embassy officials have not been privy to the prosecution 's case against [PER Sahebi.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Regarding his job perfomance , [PER Sahebi  ] also mentioned to [ORG USG  ] officials that in his less than two years as mayor he had found files for approximately 32,000 applicants who paid for non-existent plots of land in [LOC Kabul  ] city . 
He said he ordered a halt to the distribution of residential and commercial land until claims could be sorted out and invalidated the illegal claims of some important people like Engineer [PER Ahmed Shah  ] , who is close to the fundamentalist former warlord [ORG MP  ] , [PER Rasoul Sayyaf  ] ( [PER Pashtun  ] , [LOC Kabul  ] ) . 
This claim supports information reported reftel that some of [PER Sahebi  ] 's official decisions may have antagonized powerful people who then sought to use the power of the state to discredit him. ------------------------------ [PER Karzai  ] 's Motives Still Unclear ------------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Comment: Metaphorically speaking ( there is no jury trial in [LOC Afghanistan  ] ) the jury is still out on [PER Sahebi  ] , the first high-profile case of official corruption following [PER Karzai  ] 's re-election . 
[PER Sahebi  ] 's case is on appeal , but no hearing date has been set . 
Unfortunately for the former mayor , he has already been tried in the press and condemned as an embezzler , a charge that apparently was not even brought and for which we have seen no evidence . 
As for the formal process itself , it appears that [PER Sahebi  ] may have been convicted without having been accorded what little due process there is under [MISC Afghan  ] law. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The [MISC Novandish  ] appointment may indicate that [PER Karzai  ] concluded , despite his initial forceful defense of [PER Sahebi  ] , that it was more politically expedient to sacrifice him . 
[PER Karzai  ] may hope both to satisfy international expectations that he will act to clean up his government and at the same time to placate powerful [MISC Afghan  ] players who wanted the ex-mayor gone for their own mercenary reasons .
