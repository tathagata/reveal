SUMMARY: [LOC Spain  ] 's Minister of [ORG Environment and Rural and Marine Affairs  ] ( [ORG MARM  ] ) will vote in favor of proposals to approve three biotech maize varieties for import at the October 19 [ORG Agriculture Council Meeting  ] , although GOS officials do not expect the proposals to be approved . 
While a delegate to the [ORG Standing Committee  ] indicated that [LOC Spain  ] 's final decision on the MIR604 and [ORG Syngenta Bt11  ] is still being debated within [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG Inter-Ministerial Council  ] , a [ORG Ministry  ] official assured [MISC AgCouns  ] that [LOC Spain  ] will also vote favorably on the two biotech maize proposals at the October 19 [ORG Standing Committee  ] on [ORG Food Chain and Animal Health  ] . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
Econoff delivered reftel demarche October 15 to [PER Alfredo Bonet  ] , Secretary General for Trade at the [ORG Ministry of Industry  ] , Tourism , and Trade . 
[PER Bonet  ] replied that his [ORG Ministry  ] favored approval of the biotech maize varieties and would advocate for this position in [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG Inter-Ministerial Council  ] , but he was not in a position to state what [LOC Spain  ] 's final position would be. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
Separately , Agricultural Counselor and Agricultural Specialist met October 15 with [PER Eduardo Diez Patier  ] , Chief of Staff to the Secretary of State for [ORG Rural Affairs  ] and [ORG Water  ] , to deliver reftel demarche. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
According to [PER Diez Patier  ] , both the Minister of [ORG Environment and Rural and Marine Affairs  ] , [PER Elena Espinosa  ] , and the Secretary of State ( Vice-Minister equivalent ) for [ORG Rural Affairs  ] and [ORG Water  ] , [PER Josef Puxeu  ] , will attend the October 19 meeting of the [ORG Agriculture Council  ] . 
[LOC Spain  ] will vote in favor of all three biotech maize varieties for import . 
However , he noted that they do not expect the vote to pass and so the issue will be deferred to the [ORG Commission  ] . 
The problem is that the current [ORG Commission  ] , which meets every Wednesday , expires on October 31 . 
The [ORG Commission  ] will have two opportunities to vote on the three biotech maize varieties before its term expires . 
If there is no vote before November 1 , then the issue will be deferred to the new [ORG Commission  ] . 
The Chief of Staff stated that this will be problematic as it may take some time for newly elected [ORG EU  ] governments to select new [ORG Commission  ] members . 
The interim " temporary " [ORG Commission  ] could take up the biotech maize issue - or it could be deferred until later in the year when all positions are permanently filled . 
This could potentially delay the vote until January 2010 or later. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
Mr. [PER Diez Patier  ] also confidently stated that [LOC Spain  ] would vote in favor of both MIR604 maize for import and the renewal of approval for [ORG Syngenta Bt11  ] at the October 19 [ORG Standing Committee Meeting  ] . 
However , a follow-up call to [PER Esther Esteban  ] , Area Manager at the General Directorate of [ORG Sustainable Development  ] who coordinates biotech policy issues in [LOC Spain  ] , indicated a less certain position . 
[PER Ms. Esteban  ] noted that [PER Anabel de la Pena  ] from the [ORG Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition and Jesus Salas  ] from [ORG MARM  ] 's Sub Directorate for Animal Feed will attend the [ORG Standing Committee Meeting for Spain  ] . 
She stated that the [ORG Inter-Ministerial Council  ] , which will decide on [LOC Spain  ] 's vote , is still deliberating and will meet on Friday afternoon to come to consensus on the two biotech maize votes. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
COMMENT: While the [ORG Inter-Ministerial Council  ] appears to still be debating [LOC Spain  ] 's position on the two biotech maize approvals at the [ORG Standing Committee  ] , the Chief of Staff clearly stated that the Government of [LOC Spain  ] would not deviate from its traditional position of supporting new biotech approvals and renewals . 
The anti-GMO factions within [ORG MARM  ] 's environmental departments are losing strength and influence as [ORG Ministry  ] officials at the highest levels continue to push their pro-biotechnology position both at home and in [LOC Brussels  ] . 
END COMMENT .
