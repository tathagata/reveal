The Ambassador asked about the possibilities for further development of transport infrastructure and the prospects for [ORG Public-Private Partnership  ] ( [LOC PPP  ] ) development projects . 
[PER Lastra  ] replied that investment in infrastructure has been negligible over the past few years , and that prospects for new investments are poor due to lack of government funding and lack of adequate guarantees of public contributions in [LOC PPP  ] projects. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] further noted that [ORG ADM  ] is the [LOC U.S  ] . 
's largest ethanol producer and asked if the company has interest in producing ethanol either in [LOC Brazil  ] or in third countries . 
[PER Lastra  ] responded that as far as he is aware , [ORG ADM  ] has no plans to produce ethanol outside the [LOC U.S.  ] He also noted that [ORG ADM  ] 's new CEO , [PER Patricia Woert  ] , would visit [LOC Brazil  ] October 18-20 to discuss the ethanol market with Development and Trade Minister [PER Furlan  ] and others. ------------------------------------ COSAN: SUGAR AND ETHANOL DISCUSSIONS ------------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 .

[LOC Cosan  ] is the largest sugar company in [LOC Brazil  ] , producing about eight percent of [LOC Brazil  ] 's sugar and ethanol . 
The Ambassador was hosted for the day by [ORG COSAN  ] CEO [PER Rubens Mello  ] and [PER Eduardo Carvalho  ] , President of the [LOC Sao Paulo State Sugar Industry Association  ] ( [ORG UNICA  ] ) . <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
The day began with a meeting at [LOC Cosan  ] headquarters . 
[PER Mello  ] gave an overview of his company 's activities and size in relation to the [MISC Brazilian  ] industry as a whole . 
[LOC Cosan  ] is [LOC Brazil  ] 's largest production group , with 17 sugar mills and interests in two sugar/ethanol export terminals in the port of [LOC Santos  ] . 
Dr. [PER Carvalho  ] emphasized the importance of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] state in national sugar production . 
About 65 percent of [MISC Brazilian  ] sugar is produced in the state . 
The Ambassador asked what the key is to building a world ethanol market . 
Both responded that lifting of the $0.54/gallon import levy on [MISC Brazilian  ] exports would be the key to building volume and allowing the market to develop . 
With respect to prospects for developing biofuel industries in third countries , [PER Mello  ] said that the possibility exists , but that third country sugar industries are often propped up by artificially elevated local prices and preferential access to markets such as the [LOC U.S.  ] or the [MISC E.U. As  ] a result , ethanol is not a cost-effective use for local cane in these countries. ------------------- VISIT TO SUGAR MILL ------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
The group then proceeded to [LOC Piracicaba  ] and toured the [ORG Costa SAO PAULO  ] 00001137 002 OF 002 [PER Pinto  ] sugar mill . 
[PER Costa Pinto  ] was built in 1946 and crushes approximately 1.5 million tons of sugar cane per year , producing both sugar and ethanol . 
The Ambassador and his delegation were driven to the canebrakes and observed manual harvesting of sugar cane , which is still needed for cane planted in rough terrain , as well as mechanized harvesting at cane planted in level terrain . 
Afterward , the group followed the progress of cut sugarcane through the delivery and crushing areas . 
At [ORG Costa Pinto  ] , two lines with five mills each crush sugarcane 24 hours a day from April through November . 
The group also visited the ethanol production line , receiving an explanation on the fermentation and distillation process. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
Following the mill visit , the group transferred to the [PER Mello  ] 's [LOC Campo Alto  ] farm for lunch . 
Discussion centered on [LOC Brazil  ] 's desire for access to the [LOC U.S.  ] ethanol market , prospects for development of sugar/ethanol industries in other countries , and new investor interest in the [MISC Brazilian  ] sugar industry . 
[PER Mello  ] will be traveling to [LOC Washington  ] in the near future , and Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] recommended that he meet with several people in [LOC Washington  ] including both [ORG IDB  ] and Department contacts .
