BARCELONA  ] 15 <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
09 [LOC MADRID  ] 1161 [LOC MADRID  ] 00000174 001.3 OF 003 SUMMARY: <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Ambassador met February 10 with Minister of Culture [PER Angeles Gonzalez Sinde  ] to discuss bilateral cooperation on cultural issues , intellectual property rights and draft legislation that would enhance the government 's ability to combat digital piracy , and the Holocaust-related claim by AMCIT [PER Claude Cassirer  ] on a State-owned painting in [LOC Madrid  ] 's [ORG Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum  ] . 
The Minister reiterated the government 's request that the Embassy continue to engage with the political opposition on draft legislation for shutting down pirate websites . 
With respect to the [PER Cassirer  ] claim , Ministry officials says the [MISC Spanish  ] state is prohibited from giving away property or offering compensation , but the Ambassador asked the Minister to look at some different options to resolve the matter in a more satisfactory fashion . 
End Summary . 
CULTURAL COOPERATION <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) The Minister was accompanied by her Chief of Staff , [PER Javier Bonilla  ] , and Director General ( DG ) for [ORG Cultural Policy and Industries Guillermo Corral  ] van [LOC Damme  ] . 
Ambassador Solomont began by listing the various cultural events he has participated in since his recent arrival . 
The Ambassador also mentioned the partnership between the [MISC Boston-based  ] [ORG Berklee School of Music and Spain  ] 's General Society of Authors and Publishers ( [ORG SGAE  ] ) in developing a cultural center and music university in [LOC Valencia  ] , which he characterized as an " ambitious project . 
" The Ambassador also thanked the Minister for her work on the [PER Fulbright  ] grantee selection boards and her speech at the November 2009 event celebrating the 50th anniversary of the first [MISC Spanish  ] grants awarded under the program . 
Finally , he mentioned that the [ORG Boston Museum of Fine Arts  ] plans to lend a [PER John Singer Sargent  ] painting , which was influenced by the [MISC Velazquez  ] masterpiece " [PER Las Meninas  ] , " to the [ORG Prado  ] , and he hoped the Minister could attend a reception for the [LOC Boston  ] delegation in March . 
IPR PROTECTION AND ANTI-PIRACY MEASURES <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Ambassador Solomont said he had heard a great deal about [LOC Spain  ] 's [MISC Internet  ] piracy problem , from [ORG MPAA  ] CEO [ORG Glickman  ] and others , and asked where things stand with the government 's legislative proposal ( ref B ) on shutting down or blocking pirate websites . 
Minister [PER Gonzalez-Sinde  ] replied that everything the government tries to do in this area is big news , since attempts to regulate [MISC Internet  ] activity are of intense interest to young people , the media , and companies like [ORG Google  ] . 
The government 's proposal , she said , is quite reasonable and even modest . 
The government has pledged not to move aggressively against citizens and individual users as has been proposed in [LOC France  ] and the [LOC UK  ] , but its initiative is nonetheless controversial . 
Many politicians , she averred , have little information or understanding of the issue . 
Even those who recognize the damage that [MISC Internet  ] piracy does to cultural industries have not been helpful. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) At the same time , the Minister said there has been a lot of progress and an open public debate on the issues surrounding [MISC Internet  ] piracy since she came into office last April . 
There are still populist demands for " free culture " on the [MISC Internet  ] , but these are being taken less seriously in the media . 
The [MISC Internet  ] is shaking up traditional modes of cultural distribution , she said . 
Increased use of the e-book is sensitizing authors and influential media owners to the piracy problem. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Congressional  ] debate over the government 's draft law will be complicated , and this is where the Minister said the Ambassador can help . 
The Government believes it is making progress with Deputies from the ruling [MISC Spanish  ] Socialist [ORG Workers Party  ] ( [ORG PSOE  ] ) , but is concerned about the opposition [ORG Populist Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) . 
The Ambassador noted he had raised the issue in his initial meeting with [ORG PP  ] leader [PER Mariano Rajoy  ] and had told him how important the issue is to the [ORG USG  ] and private industry . 
[PER Gonzalez-Sinde  ] pointed out that if the government does not solve this problem now , it [LOC MADRID  ] 00000174 002.3 OF 003 could become an issue in the next presidential campaign . 
Should the [ORG PP  ] come back to power , it will have to deal with this issue , because the current situation is unsustainable over time . 
( Comment: As reported septel , [ORG DG Corral  ] told econoffs recently that the government faces opposition from some members of the ruling party , and he asked us to make our views known to legislators from the regional [ORG Convergencia i Unio  ] ( [ORG Cataluna  ] ) and [ORG Partido Nacional Vasco  ] ( [LOC Basque Country  ] ) blocs . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Ambassador said the [ORG USG  ] wants to see the legislation move forward in [ORG Congress  ] and not be weakened in the amendment process . 
He also noted that the music industry in particular does not believe the government 's proposal will solve the problem , to which the Minister replied that the Government has committed to trying this approach first , and if it doesn't prove effective , they will come back with additional and perhaps stronger measures . 
The music industry is important to [LOC Spain  ] , she said , because it helps promote the [MISC Spanish  ] language in [LOC Latin America  ] and also in the [LOC United States.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) On another issue , the Minister raised the draft law being considered by the [MISC Catalan  ] regional legislature that would require that foreign films be dubbed or subtitled into the [MISC Catalan  ] language ( ref A ) . 
She placed the issue in the context of requirements that television networks finance and broadcast [MISC Spanish  ] and [MISC European  ] films , and said it was also related to the transition of televisions and films from analog to digital format . 
She said the [MISC Catalan  ] regional government ( Generalitat ) is responding to public interest in promoting the language and sees these other initiatives as unnatural and unbalanced . 
It is trying to push back , but its attempt to require that more films be shown in [MISC Catalan  ] is risky , as major studios and distributors oppose it . 
So do movie house owners , who cite low demand because , in their experience , even [MISC Catalan  ] speakers prefer to see movies in [MISC Spanish  ] . 
[PER Gonzalez-Sinde  ] was not certain whether the regional [ORG Parliament  ] would pass the law in its current session . 
[PER CASSIRER  ] CLAIM <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ambassador raised the claim of AMCIT [PER Claude Cassirer  ] to a [PER Camille Pissarro  ] painting that is currently part of the [ORG Thyssen Museum  ] 's permanent collection . 
The Ambassador noted that [LOC Spain  ] had participated in the 1998 [ORG Washington Conference  ] on [MISC Nazi  ] Confiscated Art and in last year 's [ORG Prague Conference  ] . 
[LOC Spain  ] had signed the Declarations of Principles but was in the position of possessing a painting that the [MISC Nazis  ] had forced its original owner to sell . 
He cited a [MISC German  ] government letter stating that the compensation the owner had received from [LOC Germany  ] for the painting 's original disappearance did not extinguish the family 's claim to restitution or compensation . 
Ambassador hoped the [ORG GOS  ] would facilitate face-to-face negotiations on compensation , as opposed to " moral recognition . 
" Acknowledging that the claimant has a lawsuit against [LOC Spain  ] and the [ORG Thyssen Foundation  ] before the 9th [ORG Circuit Court of Appeals  ] , Ambassador asked what prevented the [ORG GOS  ] from playing a stronger hand outside the legal process. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Minister [PER Gonzalez-Sinde  ] replied that lawyers for the [ORG MFA  ] and the [ORG Museum  ] have advised that [LOC Spain  ] is legally barred from returning the painting or paying compensation . 
She offered to speak again to FM Moratinos to see if anything can be done . 
[ORG DG Corral  ] pointed out that [LOC Spain  ] had acquired the painting legally and in good faith and had no involvement in the transaction in which a [MISC Nazi  ] art dealer coerced the painting from its owner . 
The [ORG Thyssen Foundation  ] manages the collection that includes the painting , but the [ORG State  ] owns it . 
There is no legal way for the [ORG State  ] to surrender its property absent a judicial order , he said , and the government could be sued if it tried . 
The [ORG State  ] is legally bound to protect its property , even at times against its own will. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Spain  ] is sensitive to the family 's claim , [ORG Corral  ] said , but does not believe it can legally negotiate compensation . 
It might , however , be able to make gestures to the family and to the [LOC Los Angeles  ] Jewish community . 
The government could , for example , organize and fund travel to [LOC Spain  ] and cultural exchanges to promote mutual understanding [LOC MADRID  ] 00000174 003.3 OF 003 and appreciation while giving due recognition to the [PER Cassirer  ] family. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Ambassador suggested that the [ORG GOS  ] try to come up with creative solutions . 
At the same time , he undertook to convey the [ORG GOS  ] concerns to [PER Cassirer  ] 's attorneys and to ask them to offer a series of options for the government to consider . 
If there appear to be viable options , they could serve as a basis for direct negotiations . 
Post will follow up with [MISC EUR/OHI  ] .
