<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISLAMABAD 001119 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 05/05/2019 TAGS PREL , PTER , MARR , PK SUBJECT: KAYANI IS “DESPERATE” FOR HELICOPTERS Classified By: [PER Anne W. Patterson  ] , for reasons 1.4 ( b ) ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary and [ORG Action Request  ] . 
In a two hour conversation with Ambassador May 23 , Chief of [ORG Army Staff General  ] [PER Kayani  ] told Ambassador he was “desperate” for helicopter support as he had only five [MISC MI-17s  ] operational . 
[PER Kayani  ] insisted that [MISC Pakistani  ] technicians were capable of doing required helicopter maintenance . 
There are two ways for the [MISC Pakistani  ] military to acquire additional helicopters relatively quickly: ( 1 ) a lease , and we understand a waiver to enable the [ORG USG  ] to lease [MISC MI-17s  ] now needs only congressional notification ; and ( 2 ) procurement through [MISC Pakistan’s  ] [ORG FMF  ] account , which also requires a waiver . 
We expect [LOC Pakistan  ] to prefer the first option . 
Post acknowledges the frustration of dealing with the [MISC Pakistani  ] military , but it is critical to our interests that they receive help as soon as possible to clear Swat and move on the [MISC Waziristans  ] , the heart of cross-border operations against [LOC U.S.  ] forces in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Post recommends that we request expedited congressional notification of the [MISC MI-17  ] waiver . 
In the meantime , we continue to seek [MISC Cobra  ] helicopter spare parts . 
End Summary and [ORG Action Request.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In a two hour conversation May 23 ( septel ) Chief of [ORG Army Staff General  ] [PER Kayani  ] told Ambassador he was “desperate” for helicopter support . 
He said he could not move against [LOC North  ] and [LOC South Waziristan  ] until he had more lift . 
At that moment , he said he had five [MISC MI-17s  ] operational . 
( This is a lower number than others have told us . 
) As has been previously reported , [PER Kayani  ] wanted [LOC U.S.  ] support to lease [MISC MI-17  ] helicopters , and he needed spare parts for the [MISC Cobra  ] helicopters . 
Ambassador said she wanted to “clear the air” about some of the offers of [LOC U.S.  ] assistance that had gone unanswered , such as the helicopter maintenance contract and the [ORG ISR  ] platform. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Kayani  ] said he did not need [LOC U.S.  ] help on maintenance: the Cobras were twenty-five years old and had been maintained by [MISC Pakistani  ] technicians . 
But he needed the [ORG U.S. Government  ] to stop the constant stream of leaks from [LOC Washington  ] . 
These always made it appear as if he were taking steps in response to [LOC U.S.  ] demands . 
He said he had been successfully moving troops from the eastern border , but this was undermined by the drumbeat in the [LOC U.S.  ] press that he was taking this action in response to [LOC U.S.  ] demands . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] , he said , is always trying to press on him sophisticated [LOC U.S.  ] systems , which the [MISC Pakistani  ] military had neither the ability nor the funds to manage . 
Domestic political support for current combat operations would be eroded by a bigger [LOC U.S.  ] military presence , he said. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Embassy understands that the [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC North Korea  ] , and [LOC Syria  ] [MISC Nonproliferation Act  ] ( [ORG INKSNA  ] ) waiver that enables the [ORG USG  ] potentially to procure or lease [MISC MI-17s  ] has just been approved by the [ORG Department ,  ] and the only remaining hurdle is the [ORG Congressional  ] notification . 
The notification process needs to be expedited . 
The [MISC Mission  ] is considering options to assist [LOC Pakistan  ] Army in procuring or leasing [MISC MI-17s  ] . 
If the supplemental is passed , our preferred option is to use the [LOC Pakistan  ] Counterinsurgency [ORG Capabilities Fund  ] ( [ORG PCCF  ] ) to lease nine [MISC MI-17s  ] . 
A [LOC U.S.  ] controlled lease of this kind allows us to include necessary maintenance ( which any contractor is likely to stipulate ) and provides leverage over use of the helicopters in order to ensure the helicopters are applied in counter-insurgency activities . 
The nine [MISC MI-17s  ] the [MISC Pakistanis  ] have requested would be leased for the duration of ongoing overhauls of nine [LOC Pakistan  ] Army [MISC MI-17s  ] and would , in effect , be a 1-for-1 backfill of those helicopters in overhaul. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Alternately , if the supplemental is not passed in time , the [MISC Mission  ] can advise the [MISC GOP  ] to use its [ORG FMF  ] to buy or lease [MISC MI-17  ] helicopters . 
If the [MISC GOP  ] chooses to use its [ORG FMF  ] for this purpose , the [MISC Mission  ] will need to obtain an [ORG Offshore Procurement  ] ( [ORG OSP  ] ) waiver from DOD , with [ORG State Department and Department of Treasury  ] concurrence , and an agreement with the [MISC GOP  ] specifying the conditions on how they intend to use these new [MISC MI-17  ] helicopters , The terms of the agreement will specify use of the helicopters in support of counter-terrorism and counterinsurgency ( [ORG COIN  ] ) operations in the [LOC Federally Administered Tribal Areas  ] , the [ORG Northwest Frontier Province  ] , and portions of [LOC Balochistan  ] . 
Further , if a purchase , the agreement will require a comprehensive ISLAMABAD 00001119 002 OF 002 maintenance and logistics package in conjunction with the helicopters. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Finally , we will require access to the helicopters above and beyond normal End Use Monitoring standards in order to certify the helicopters’ use in [ORG COIN  ] operations . 
The Mission’s assessment is that because the [LOC Pakistan  ] military has not forecast the use of [ORG FMF  ] for helicopter procurement , the opportunity cost of using [ORG FMF  ] to procure helicopters makes it unlikely that the [MISC GOP  ] would choose to do so quickly . 
In any case , we are fully prepared to assist the [LOC Pakistan  ] Army to address the maintenance issues of the [MISC MI-17  ] helicopters if it so desires . 
If , as General [PER Kayani  ] indicates , only five [MISC MI-17s  ] are operational , we can produce the equivalent of ‘new’ helicopters by assisting the [LOC Pakistan  ] Army to repair the helicopters that are non-operational. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Other helicopters in [MISC Pakistan’s  ] aviation fleet face equally troubling operational readiness and availability issues . 
We are searching for and acquiring specific critical spare items for [MISC Cobra  ] helicopters as quickly as possible , and have provided an agreement to resume work on eight [MISC Pakistani  ] Cobras now in the [LOC U.S.  ] Despite the urgency of the existing situation in the [ORG NWFP  ] and [ORG FATA  ] , we are waiting for the [MISC GOP  ] to sign letters of agreement on [MISC Cobra  ] spare parts. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Comment: Embassy is aware that [LOC U.S.  ] engagement with the [MISC Pakistani  ] military has been frustrating . 
Transparency is often non-existent . 
Offers of assistance go unanswered or are overruled at headquarters , even as [MISC Pakistan’s  ] maintenance and training are inadequate . 
Still , the success of our own troop surge in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and the stability of [MISC Pakistan’s  ] government depend on rolling back the terrorist threat in Swat and eliminating the terrorist safehavens in the [MISC Waziristans  ] . 
The inability of the [MISC GOP  ] to control [LOC North  ] and [LOC South Waziristan  ] has enabled terrorists to operate throughout the country . 
[PER Kayani  ] confided to an [MISC American  ] visitor recently that he would not be able to move to [PER Waziristan  ] until late summer . 
While that movement will not be determined solely by the availability of helicopter support , it is certainly the case that the availability of helicopters will be a key factor in making the decision to go .
