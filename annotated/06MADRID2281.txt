[PER Eduardo A. Aguirre  ] Jr. for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: During his trip to [LOC Ronda  ] in southern [LOC Spain  ] 's [LOC Andalucia  ] region , Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] spent the afternoon and evening of September 9 with Foreign Minister [PER Miguel Angel Moratinos  ] . 
Ambassador pressed [PER Moratinos  ] on recent incendiary comments from President [PER Zapatero  ] regarding [LOC Iraq  ] , and he raised the pending sale of patrol boats to [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
Outside the confines of the capital , [PER Moratinos  ] spoke candidly about several issues , voicing pessimism about progress on [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Syria  ] and expressing confidence in his position within the [ORG GOS  ] . 
He indicated that [LOC Spain  ] 's top foreign policy priorities are the [LOC Middle East  ] , [LOC North Africa  ] ( [LOC Western Sahara  ] and the [MISC Moroccan  ] bilateral relationship ) , and the continuing issue of illegal immigration from [LOC Sub-Saharan Africa  ] . 
[PER Moratinos  ] also touched on the recent shakeup in his ministry with the addition of [PER Trini Jimenez  ] at the deputy minister level , saying that he expected Deputy FM [PER Bernardino Leon  ] 's influence would not be adversely impacted and [PER Leon  ] would retain direct control of relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC Cuba  ] and [LOC Bolivia  ] , three key foreign policy issues for [LOC Spain  ] . 
In a September 11 telcon with Ambassador , [PER Leon  ] expressed the same sentiment . 
END SUMMARY. //IRAN , [LOC SYRIA  ] , [LOC LEBANON//  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Moratinos  ] asked whether Ambassador had seen his letter to Secretary Rice on the [LOC Middle East/Iran  ] ( faxed from [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG Embassy Washington  ] to EUR/WE on September 8 ) and said he hoped he would have the chance to follow up with the Secretary at [LOC UNGA  ] . 
Ambassador promised to check on the SIPDIS Secretary 's reply . 
SIPDIS <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Moratinos  ] expressed pessimism on [LOC Iran  ] , and he is increasingly inclined to view the issue as a global crisis . 
He said that a solution to [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear ambitions may be beyond reach . 
[PER Moratinos  ] told Ambassador that the recent visit by [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear negotiator [PER Ali Lariyani  ] came at [LOC Iran  ] 's request . 
According to [PER Moratinos  ] , President [PER Zapatero  ] agreed to the visit warily , and his meeting with [PER Lariyani  ] was nothing more than an exchange of pleasantries . 
NOTE: Embassy will report septel on [LOC Spain  ] 's [LOC Iran  ] activism . 
END NOTE. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Regarding the recent trip to [LOC Iran  ] of former [MISC Spanish  ] President [PER Felipe Gonzalez  ] , [PER Moratinos  ] said that no one in the [ORG GOS  ] had asked him to go , although they did not object when [PER Gonzalez  ] notified them of his intended travel . 
[PER Moratinos  ] expressed disappointment in [LOC Gonzalez'  ] comments in [LOC Iran  ] , saying that there was no value added , but perhaps some value lost . 
NOTE: In his remarks , [PER Gonzalez  ] went well beyond the current [MISC Western  ] position on [LOC Iran  ] , stating that the current crisis was an opportunity for engagement and defending [LOC Iran  ] 's right to nonmilitary nuclear development . 
END NOTE. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Ambassador , drawing on ref points , asked [PER Moratinos  ] for [LOC Spain  ] 's help in ensuring that [ORG Hizbollah  ] not be allowed to rearm , that the [MISC Syrian-Lebanese  ] border be tightly monitored , and that [LOC Syria  ] be held accountable for any re-supply of [ORG Hizbollah  ] . 
[PER Moratinos  ] said that he was of the same mind . 
[PER Moratinos  ] also noted that [LOC Spain  ] 's presence in [LOC Lebanon  ] was critical and was evidence of their unwavering commitment to a solution in the [LOC Middle East.  ] //ZAPATERO OFF MESSAGE// <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Ambassador took the opportunity to raise the recent controversial comments made by President [PER Zapatero  ] in a September 8 interview in [LOC Germany  ] , in which the [MISC Spanish  ] President seemed to go out of his way to blame international terrorism on the [LOC U.S.  ] invasion of [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Ambassador told [PER Moratinos  ] that his understanding was that the [ORG GOS  ] was going to put [LOC Iraq  ] in the past in the interest of the bilateral relationship . 
Ambassador said that he had chosen not to respond to these particular remarks , part of what has been an ongoing nuisance . 
However , if the Government of [LOC Spain  ] wished to continue with its rhetorical barbs , then the Ambassador would oblige . 
[PER Moratinos  ] responded that he too was perturbed by [PER Zapatero  ] 's comments and spoke with the President after the interview . 
He stated his belief that [PER Zapatero  ] would refrain from such statements in the future . 
NOTE: In his September [LOC MADRID  ] 00002281 002 OF 002 11 address at the [ORG ASEM  ] summit in [LOC Helsinki  ] , [PER Zapatero  ] took a more restrained approach and focused not on the [LOC United States  ] but on the global crisis of international terrorism . 
END NOTE. //MIGRATION: NO HELP FROM WEST AFRICA// <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) On illegal immigration , [PER Moratinos  ] expressed great frustration . 
He noted that [LOC Spain  ] 's diplomatic efforts in [LOC West Africa  ] are yielding little tangible results , and he singled out [LOC Senegal  ] in particular as a country that agreed to cooperate ( after a visit by VP [PER Fernandez de la Vega  ] ) but has done little . 
Ambassador only half-jokingly noted that there are four warships currently under construction in [LOC Spain  ] that could be used for patrolling the [MISC West African  ] coast if the sale to [LOC Venezuela  ] were to be canceled . 
COMMENT: A recent poll showed a four percent drop in President [PER Zapatero  ] 's approval rating since July , with illegal immigration as the leading issue of concern . 
The [PER Zapatero  ] government appears to be at somewhat of a loss for how to handle the situation , and it is having difficulty making the issue a top priority in the [ORG European Union  ] . 
END COMMENT. //BOLIVIA AND CUBA// <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Moratinos  ] opined that [PER Evo Morales  ] was not fully in charge in [LOC Bolivia  ] and that he was saying one thing and doing another . 
[PER Moratinos  ] said [LOC Spain  ] is having minimal success establishing credibility and traction with the [PER Morales  ] government , noting that while [PER Morales  ] has tried to assuage [MISC Spanish  ] concerns about their hydrocarbon interests , people in his own government do not appear to be under his control . 
[PER Moratinos  ] views [MISC Bolivian  ] Vice President [PER Alvaro Marcelo Garcia Linera  ] as the real power in [LOC La Paz.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) On [LOC Cuba  ] , [PER Moratinos  ] said that Deputy Minister [PER Bernardino Leon  ] is in [LOC Cuba  ] now and could provide Ambassador with a readout upon his return . 
Ambassador reminded [PER Moratinos  ] that the [LOC United States  ] is still interested in a joint statement on [LOC Cuba  ] . 
[PER Moratinos  ] replied that the planned meeting in [LOC New York  ] with [PER A/S Shannon  ] will be a good opportunity to discuss the situation frankly. //FEELING GOOD// <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Moratinos  ] told the Ambassador that he feels very confident about his position in the [ORG GOS  ] and that what he called recent [MISC Spanish  ] foreign policy " successes " have empowered him to continue pursuing an aggressive agenda . 
He also told Ambassador that the recent addition of PSOE foreign policy advisor [PER Trinidad Jimenez  ] as Secretary of State for [LOC Iberoamerica  ] was not intended to reduce the influence of current Secretary of State for Foreign Policy [PER Bernardino Leon  ] . 
Rather , the move frees up [PER Leon  ] to truly act as a deputy with oversight throughout the ministry , and [PER Leon  ] will still hold the [LOC Bolivia  ] , [LOC Cuba  ] and [LOC United States  ] accounts . 
During a September 11 telcon , [PER Leon  ] told Ambassador much the same . 
[PER Leon  ] said his travel load will likely not change in the immediate future , though presumably [PER Jimenez  ] will do more traveling once she is up to speed. ------------------------------------------ Visit Embassy Madrid 's Classified Website ; http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/eur/madrid/ ------------------------------------------ AGUIRRE</pre></code>
