Frustration with the [ORG IMF  ] , s [ORG Role  ] in [ORG Icesave  ] --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Charge d'Affaires met opposition [ORG Independence Party  ] Chairman [PER Bjarni Benediktsson  ] to discuss a range of issues on November 11 . 
[PER Benediktsson  ] said that one reason he hoped to meet a high ranking official from the [LOC White House  ] was to express frustration with the role the [ORG IMF  ] played in the [ORG Icesave  ] dispute . 
He opined that the [ORG Icesave  ] matter was , originally , an issue that involved only the Governments of [LOC Iceland  ] , [LOC Great Britain  ] and the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
The dispute among the three countries , he said , centered on whether the [MISC Icelandic  ] government must serve as guarantor for [MISC British  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] depositors that lost money when the [MISC Icelandic  ] banking system collapsed . 
There was no [ORG EU  ] legislation , according to [PER Benediktsson  ] , that obligated [LOC Iceland  ] to act as such a guarantor and legal precedents on the topic were murky at best . 
[LOC Great Britain  ] and the [LOC Netherlands  ] , he said , understood that they were not operating from positions of strength and brought the [ORG IMF  ] into the equation to force [LOC Iceland  ] 's hand . 
The threat of withholding [ORG IMF  ] loans until the [ORG Icesave  ] dispute was resolved was used to force the Government of [LOC Iceland  ] to capitulate . 
It was , he contended , a great misuse of the [ORG IMF  ] and completely unfair to [LOC Iceland.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Benediktsson  ] suggested that , at this point , the best thing that could happen for the [MISC Icelandic  ] people would be for the measure to fail in a Parliamentary vote . 
The [MISC British  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] would then , he said , be forced to sue the Government of [LOC Iceland  ] and seek compensation via the courts . 
A legal solution would , he felt , be more preferable than the negotiated settlement that is being thrust on the people of [LOC Iceland  ] . 
[PER Benediktsson  ] added that if the [MISC British  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] did not feel comfortable pursuing the matter via [MISC Icelandic  ] courts , he would be happy to suggest that the issue be resolved by a tribunal of independent judiciaries . 
He even suggested that a [ORG U.S. Supreme Court Justice  ] could play a role as an arbitrator in the proceedings. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Bendiktsson  ] said that , in an attempt to force the issue into the courts , he intends to oppose the government-sponsored [ORG Icesave  ] bill when it comes up for a vote in Parliament . 
( [PER Note: Benediktsson  ] , along with most of his opposition [ORG Independence Party  ] colleagues , abstained when the previous law was passed in August . 
End note ) . 
He acknowledged , however , that the coalition government probably had the votes necessary to pass the measure through parliament . 
He also admitted that , were he to have his way and the bill fail in parliament , it could further stall [LOC Iceland  ] 's recovery efforts . 
It would certainly mean no further loans from the [ORG IMF  ] and , without that cash inflow , the government would be unable to lift its capital control restrictions and would likely have to issue [MISC Euro  ] bonds to raise the necessary capital . 
He also said he was not anxious to assume leadership of the government , but preferred to remain in opposition until after the May 2010 municipal elections to benefit candidates from his party . 
Increased Bilateral Cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Benediktsson  ] also hoped to discuss with the [LOC White House  ] ways to promote bilateral discussion and cooperation between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Iceland  ] . 
He said that when the [LOC U.S.  ] withdrew from the [ORG Keflavik Air Base  ] in 2006 it created a public perception that the relationship between [LOC Iceland  ] and the [LOC United States  ] was deteriorating . 
This perception , he suggested , has only been enhanced with [LOC Iceland  ] 's recent application to join the [ORG European Union  ] . 
[PER Benediktsson  ] acknowledged that the [ORG Strategic Dialogue  ] allows for annual high level meetings between [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Icelandic  ] government officials . 
He felt , however , that even more dialogue was necessary . 
[PER Benediktsson  ] was somewhat vague with suggestions on how to accomplish this but suggested that the Parlimentary [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000203 002 OF 002 [ORG Foreign Affairs Committee  ] visit the [LOC United States  ] . 
He then asked whether , considering [LOC Iceland  ] 's current financial problems , there might be some [LOC U.S.  ] financing available to facilitate such a trip . 
( [PER Note: Benediktsson  ] later sent [ORG CDA  ] a follow up email expressing continued interest in meeting with an official from the [LOC White House  ] even if he came alone . 
End note . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Benediktsson  ] continues to seek a meeting with a high-ranking [LOC White House  ] official to discuss increased cooperation and the [ORG IMF  ] vote even though [ORG IMF  ] board review vote is long past . 
His request may be a political ploy designed to embarrass his opponents in the government and make waves in the media . 
On the other hand , it could also fit into the agenda of his [ORG Independence Party  ] , an organization which has traditionally supported strong ties with the [LOC United States  ] and fiercely opposes [LOC Iceland  ] 's application to join the [ORG EU  ] . 
Given his proposed solution on [ORG Icesave  ] , namely send it to the courts , his angle appears more likely political than economic . 
End comment .
