Polaschik  ] , Deputy Chief of Mission , [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy [ORG Tripoli  ] , [ORG Department of State  ] . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: According to an [MISC Italian  ] diplomat , today 's meeting between [MISC Libyan  ] FM [PER Musa Kusa  ] and his [MISC Italian  ] and [MISC Maltese  ] counterparts will lead to a resolution of the current [MISC Schengen  ] visa crisis " within days . 
" In his view , the [MISC Libyans  ] invoked the visa ban on [MISC Schengen  ] states as leverage in their negotiations with the [MISC Swiss  ] , a move he deemed successful as it had elicited strong public criticism of [LOC Switzerland  ] and exacerbated already tense relations between [LOC Switzerland  ] and the [ORG EU  ] . 
[LOC Germany  ] is the only country supporting [LOC Switzerland  ] in the current situation , as it feels snubbed by [LOC Libya  ] 's reneging on a commitment to provide [LOC Germany  ] with advanced warning of any retaliatory measures in the [MISC Swiss  ] case . 
The situation improved today , with no deportations of [LOC Schengen  ] visa holders . 
End Summary . 
2 . 
( C ) The [MISC Italian  ] [ORG DCM  ] analyzed the current [MISC Libya-EU  ] standoff over visas as near resolution and expected the visa ban to be lifted " within days . 
" He told Pol/Econ Chief February 17 that he believed the [MISC Libyan  ] action had achieved its desired goal of provoking public statements from [LOC Schengen  ] states , condemning [MISC Swiss  ] actions and calling on [LOC Switzerland  ] to lift its unilateral ban on [MISC Schengen  ] visas for [MISC Libyan  ] officials . 
The diplomat thought that the timing of the [MISC Libyan  ] ban coincided with the impending release of one of the [MISC Swiss  ] businessmen from [LOC Libya  ] , which would have conceded [LOC Libya  ] 's leverage with [LOC Switzerland  ] in the political reconciliation process . 
The diplomat suspected that the [MISC Libyan  ] leader knew that once the [MISC Swiss  ] were released , [LOC Switzerland  ] would lift its ban on [MISC Schengen  ] visas for [MISC Libyan  ] diplomats , and then cut virtually all ties with [LOC Libya  ] , including abandoning the political reconciliation process . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] apparently still demands the establishment of an arbitration council to investigate the circumstances surrounding the 2008 arrest of [LOC Hannibal  ] al-Qadhafi in [LOC Geneva  ] , a demand the [MISC Swiss  ] have refused . 
" [LOC Libya  ] needed to maintain its only instrument of power -- the two [MISC Swiss  ] -- without them , [LOC Libya  ] knew that [LOC Switzerland  ] would never compromise on the political issues , " the [ORG DCM  ] said . 
3 . 
( C ) According to the [MISC Italian  ] diplomat , the only way for the [MISC Libyans  ] to delay the release of the businessmen was to publish the alleged [MISC Swiss  ] " blacklist " of [MISC Libyan  ] officials that it would not allow to receive [LOC Schengen  ] visas , and then to make good on threats to retaliate against [LOC Europe  ] . 
The diplomat did not believe [MISC Libyan  ] allegations that the [MISC Swiss  ] had published the " blacklist , " but suspected that the [MISC Libyans  ] had drafted the list themselves . 
4 . 
( C ) Thus far the [MISC Libyan  ] strategy has been successful -- most [MISC European  ] nations have expressed , whether publicly or privately , their frustration with [LOC Switzerland  ] 's unilateral visa ban on [MISC Libyan  ] officials , which has served to exacerbate [LOC Switzerland  ] 's already negative political standing with the [ORG European Union  ] . 
[LOC Germany  ] is the only country that is backing [LOC Switzerland  ] in the current situation , as the [MISC Germans  ] feel personally affronted that [LOC Libya  ] reneged on a commitment to provide [LOC Germany  ] with advanced warning of any retaliatory measures it would invoke in the [MISC Swiss  ] case . 
The [MISC Germans  ] themselves , according to the [MISC Italian  ] diplomat , were frustrated with the reconciliation process and assessed the situation as at a stalemate , with the [MISC Swiss  ] unwilling to negotiate until the two businessmen were released . 
The diplomat did not believe that [LOC Switzerland  ] would ever give up its veto right by allowing the other [MISC European  ] nations to issue " [LOC Schengen  ] minus [LOC Switzerland  ] " visas , for the same reason that the [MISC Libyans  ] needed to keep the [MISC Swiss  ] businessmen in the country -- leverage . 
He confirmed that [MISC European  ] FMs would meet February 18 to discuss the situation . 
5 . 
( C ) The [MISC Italian  ] diplomat expected the scheduled February 17 meeting between [MISC Libyan  ] Foreign Minister-equivalent [PER Musa Kusa  ] with his [MISC Italian  ] and [MISC Maltese  ] counterparts in [LOC Rome  ] to lead to [LOC Libya  ] 's easing of its new visa policy . 
However , he expressed continued [MISC Italian  ] concern that new visas may be even more difficult for [MISC Europeans  ] to obtain , due to the [MISC Libyan  ] leader 's possible paranoia about allowing too many [MISC European  ] workers into the country and taste for maintaining control by routinely shifting the balance of favors -- domestically , from one official to another , and internationally , from one country to another . 
He reported that the [MISC Libyans  ] were fulfilling the terms of their visa ban -- namely , that no diplomats or official travelers would be affected . 
No new deportations took place on February 17 and of the 25 individuals deported since the ban took effect , ten are [MISC Italian  ] General Managers resident in [LOC Libya  ] and 15 were of other [MISC European  ] nationalities . 
( [PER Note: As  ] reported reftel , it is likely that [MISC European  ] consular warnings [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000137 002.2 OF 002 advising citizens of the visa ban , as well as airline refusals to board [MISC Europeans  ] traveling to [LOC Libya  ] , contributed to the lack of deportations .
