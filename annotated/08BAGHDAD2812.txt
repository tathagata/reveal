This is a [ORG PRT Karbala Reporting Cable  ] <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: Since [LOC Iraq  ] 's liberation , [LOC Tehran  ] has sought to increase its sway within [LOC Karbala  ] and other key [MISC Shi'a  ] holy cities . 
[MISC Iranian  ] agents make use of direct payments and business favors to ensure that provincial government figures remain compliant and favorably inclined to [MISC Iranian  ] interests . 
[ORG Shamsah Travel and Tourism  ] , the dominant organization handling [MISC Iranian  ] pilgrims , is reportedly a front for [MISC Iranian  ] authorities and intelligence activities . 
While local politicians and businessmen at times contest [ORG Shamsah  ] 's reach , its influence is pervasive . 
End Summary . 
[LOC Iran  ] 's [ORG Karbala Campaign  ] ----------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) As the site of [PER Imam Husayn  ] 's martyrdom , and the birthplace of the twelfth imam , [LOC Karbala  ] holds tremendous religious significance for [MISC Shi'a  ] Muslims in general and [MISC Iranian  ] " twelvers " in particular . 
[LOC Iraq  ] 's liberation in 2003 has led to a dramatic increase in travel from [LOC Iran  ] , providing [LOC Tehran  ] with the opportunity to increase its control here . 
[LOC Iran  ] 's [LOC Karbala  ] campaign can be divided into two phases , according to knowledgeable contacts . 
The first , beginning with the liberation and lasting until 2006 , featured the ham-fisted backing of militias such as the [MISC Jaysh  ] al-Mahdi ( JAM ) and the [ORG Badr Corps  ] . 
As it became clear that [LOC Karbala  ] residents were fed up with violence and blamed [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Tehran  ] shifted to the more subtle tack of using its funds to build relationships with local government officials in order to solidify the central role of [MISC Iranian  ] businesses in the province -- especially businesses servicing the estimated one million religious visitors per year traveling to [LOC Karbala  ] from [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) By stressing its religious duty to help maintain the shrines of [PER Imam Husayn  ] and [PER Imam Abbas  ] , and its obligation to look after [MISC Iranian  ] citizens here , [LOC Tehran  ] is able to dress its [LOC Karbala  ] operations in the cloak of legitimacy . 
According to government and private-sector contacts , the mechanism through which it exerts its influence is [ORG Shamsah Travel and Tourism  ] . 
They describe [ORG Shamsah  ] as an umbrella organization comprising some 2,500 [MISC Iranian  ] companies , closely linked to the [MISC Iranian  ] Government . 
Because of [ORG Shamsah  ] 's reported size and reach , and because our contacts in local government and the tourism industry are adamant that it faces no competition from other [MISC Iranian  ] entities , we believe [ORG Shamsah  ] is identifiable with the [ORG Kosar Organization  ] . 
Described by the [ORG National Council of Resistance of Iran  ] as the soft arm of the [ORG Qods Force  ] , [ORG Kosar  ] is designed to set up logistics support for [MISC Iranian  ] agents through business and charitable activities . 
[ORG Shamsah  ] 's Agents ---------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Out of 170 hospitality enterprises ( hotels , restaurants , travel and tourism businesses ) that applied to [ORG Shamsah  ] in 2007 for the opportunity to provide services to [MISC Iranian  ] visitors in [LOC Karbala  ] , only six were selected initially . 
Contacts report that [ORG Shamsah  ] 's primary agent is a 50-something former resident of [LOC Kut  ] named [PER Kareem al-Musawi  ] . 
He operates two tourism companies selected: [ORG Al-Diyar  ] and [ORG Al-Janoub  ] . 
Described as motivated by money , he also owns several hotels , a mineral water company , and a dairy . 
Some of these businesses allegedly were financed by [LOC Tehran  ] , along with homes in the [LOC Islamic Republic  ] that he visits regularly . 
Al-Musawi is widely perceived here as having access to " unlimited " [MISC Iranian  ] funding . 
He distributes 10,000-dinar ( 800 [ORG USD  ] ) " grants " to the poor and is believed to financially support [ORG Provincial Council  ] ( [ORG PC  ] ) Acting Chairman Abd al-Al al-Yasiri ( [ORG ISCI  ] ) , according to multiple contacts in local government. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Another important [ORG Shamsah  ] agent is [PER Mohammad al-Yakubi  ] , a Fadilah-affiliated [ORG PC  ] member . 
He controls the [MISC Al-Rafideen  ] and [LOC Qasr  ] al-Mustafa tourism companies here and is the uncle of [PER Hamoud Mohsen  ] al-Yakubi , chairman of the [ORG National Tourism Committee  ] . 
A third [ORG Shamsah  ] agent identified by our contacts is Abd al-Kareem al-Unayzi , a [MISC Da'wa-affiliated  ] member of the [ORG Iraqi Council of Representatives  ] ( [ORG CoR  ] ) . 
He owns the [ORG Al-Taf Travel Agency  ] in [LOC Karbala  ] . 
The sixth hospitality business [ORG Shamsah  ] selected is the [ORG Jarash Company  ] ; our contacts do not know who owns it. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Within the last six months , [ORG Shamsah  ] reportedly selected two more local affiliates: The [ORG Sadr BAGHDAD  ] 00002812 002 OF 002 organization-controlled [ORG Al-Sununu Travel Agency  ] and the [ORG Al-Manar Company for Tourism  ] , which is owned by [PER Hadi  ] al-Amari , chairman of the [ORG CoR  ] 's Security and [ORG Defense Committee  ] . 
The eight companies selected by [ORG Shamsah  ] agreed to arrange to house , feed , and transport [MISC Iranian  ] pilgrims for 136 [ORG USD  ] each for seven days ( four nights in [LOC Karbala  ] and three nights in [LOC Najaf  ] ) , according to our contacts . 
As the primary agent , al-Musawi receives 25 [ORG USD  ] out of every 136 [ORG USD  ] payment and , in exchange , coerces local hotels into servicing the [MISC Iranians  ] for 111 [ORG USD  ] each , even though this amount barely covers costs . 
Our contacts report that al-Musawi threatens to withdraw the [MISC Iranian  ] business if the hotel owners balk ; with the majority of visitors to [LOC Karbala  ] coming from the [LOC Islamic Republic  ] , hoteliers face a [PER Hobson  ] 's choice between empty rooms and rooms full of underpaying guests . 
The [ORG Central Kitchen  ] ------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In early 2007 , [ORG Shamsah  ] opened the [ORG Central Kitchen  ] ( aka the [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Kitchen  ] ) in [LOC Karbala  ] . 
Publicly , at least , the idea was to provide [MISC Iranians  ] with food to which they were accustomed ; [MISC Persian  ] pilgrims supposedly had complained that they could not stomach the local [MISC Iraqi  ] fare . 
In the run-up to last year 's [LOC Shabaniyah  ] observances , local hoteliers , butchers , and green grocers -- seeing the [ORG Central Kitchen  ] , with its imported foods and workers , as an intensification of [ORG Shamsah  ] 's threat to their livelihoods -- complained to Abd al-Mahdi al-Karbala'i , [MISC Grand Ayatollah  ] al-Sistani 's deputy . 
[MISC Al-Karbala'i  ] contacted the [ORG PC  ] , which then voted to close the [ORG Central Kitchen  ] . 
Al-Musawi countered by lobbying individual [ORG PC  ] members -- particularly al-Yasiri -- and prevailing upon the eight local companies with which [ORG Shamsah  ] does business to write to Governor [PER Aqeel Hamoud  ] al-Khazali asking for the [ORG PC  ] 's decision to be overruled . 
Our [ORG PC  ] and tourism industry contacts claim that [MISC Iranian  ] Ambassador [PER Hasan Kadhum Qomi  ] personally lobbied [ORG PC Tourism Committee  ] Chairman [PER Hasan al-Furati  ] , and that al-Musawi threatened to " crush and kill " some of the hotel owners ( [MISC Note: One  ] hotel owner told us that he was informed by a friend at the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] that a " file " had been opened on him at al-Musawi 's behest and that his case was being examined by [LOC Karbala  ] intelligence chief [PER Gen. Razaq  ] , aka " [PER Abu Amal  ] , " who belongs to [LOC ISCI/Badr  ] . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In response to the lobbying and letters , [PER Aqeel  ] asked [LOC Karbala  ] 's Hotel and Restaurant League for its opinion on the [ORG Central Kitchen  ] . 
The League responded that its members had no objection to the [ORG Central Kitchen  ] per se , but insisted that it use [MISC Iraqi  ] workers and purchase food and supplies from [MISC Iraqi  ] vendors . 
The [ORG PC  ] , meanwhile , formed a special committee , led by member [PER Hamid al-Turfi  ] ( [ORG ISCI  ] ) , to study the issue . 
In January , 2008 , al-Turfi 's committee upheld the decision to close the [ORG Central Kitchen  ] . 
It defiantly remained open until March , 2008 , when it forcibly was closed by the [MISC Iraqi  ] Police . 
Comment ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) As many [LOC Karbala  ] pilgrims inevitably hail from [LOC Iran  ] , the dominance of an [MISC Iranian-connected  ] company should not surprise , though [ORG Shamsah  ] , s coercive methods and reputed proxy intelligence role send a disturbing signal . 
Acting [ORG PC  ] Chairman [PER Al-Yasiri  ] 's incompetence ( see reftel ) and the [ORG Central Kitchen  ] brouhaha show that [MISC Iranian  ] actors in the region , economic or otherwise , are not infallible . 
PRT has concerns that [ORG Shamsah  ] Director al-Musawi and his confreres are hard at work lining the pockets of likely candidates in the provincial elections . 
[PER Al-Yasiri  ] 's survival to date , attributable to the [ORG PC  ] 's failure in several attempts to assemble a quorum for a vote to oust him , wryly has been described by some here as a " miracle ; " official contacts suggest [MISC Iranian  ] money convinced some members not to appear . 
The longer that provincial elections are delayed , the more time [LOC Tehran  ] and its local allies have to cook up similar , unpleasant , surprises .
