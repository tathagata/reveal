( C ) Summary . 
Just two months after [ORG ETA  ] 's December 30 bomb attack at [LOC Madrid  ] 's airport set off a bitter debate regarding the [ORG Zapatero Government  ] 's handling of the [MISC Basque  ] issue , [ORG Zapatero  ] has drawn fresh criticism for allowing a hunger striking [ORG ETA  ] member to serve the remainder of his sentence in house arrest for " humanitarian " reasons . 
The prisoner , [PER Jose Ignacio de Juana Chaos  ] , had served 17 years of a 30-year sentence for his role in the deaths of 18 individuals in the 1980s , most of them members of the [MISC Spanish  ] police and security forces . 
However , as he was about to be released in 2005 , prosecutors charged him with continued [ORG ETA  ] activities while in prison and eventually won an additional 3-year conviction against him . 
[PER De Juana  ] undertook two hunger strikes , igniting fervor among young [MISC Basque  ] radicals and becoming a central element in the national political debate on how -- or even whether -- to maintain peace talks with [ORG ETA  ] . 
Former Minister of [ORG Defense  ] [PER Jose Bono  ] told the Ambassador that the [ORG Zapatero Government  ] had determined that [PER De Juana  ] was truly near death and that his " martyrdom " would unleash a wave of [ORG ETA  ] violence and definitively derail the [MISC Basque  ] peace process . 
There are rumors that Socialist elder statesmen are privately critical of the [PER De Juana  ] decision , even as they voice public support for [ORG Zapatero  ] . 
The opposition [ORG Popular Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) and terrorist victims' groups reacted with indignation and mass rallies , charging that [ORG Zapatero  ] has given in to [ORG ETA  ] blackmail . 
The [ORG Socialist Party  ] ( [ORG PSOE  ] ) has responded vigorously , asserting that [PER De Juana  ] 's treatment is no different than former President [ORG Aznar  ] 's relocation of [ORG ETA  ] prisoners to the [ORG Basque Region  ] during [ORG Aznar  ] 's own attempt to negotiate peace with [MISC ETA.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The [PER De Juana  ] decision , along with the [ORG Government  ] 's low-key response to the December 30 [LOC Barajas  ] airport attack and apparent willingness to consider allowing [ORG ETA  ] 's political front to participate in May municipal elections in the [ORG Basque Region  ] , represent a huge gamble for the [ORG Zapatero Government  ] . 
[ORG Zapatero  ] is betting that the electorate will prefer continued talks with [ORG ETA  ] , even under distasteful circumstances , to a tough [ORG Government  ] reaction that results in renewed [ORG ETA  ] violence . 
A key element of [ORG Zapatero  ] 's strategy is to equate his own overtures to [ORG ETA  ] with those undertaken by the [ORG PP  ] in the 1990s . 
Polls suggest widespread public disgust with [PER De Juana  ] 's release , but this has not translated into greater political support for the [ORG PP  ] . 
The inability thus far of the [ORG PP  ] to gain traction on this issue may explain why [ORG Zapatero  ] appears willing to place his [ORG Government  ] 's fortunes in the hands of [ORG ETA  ] and its political allies . 
End Summary. //A NOTORIOUS [ORG ETA  ] TERRORIST// <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) [PER De Juana Chaos  ] , a former member of the [ORG Basque Regional Police  ] , became among the most vicious [ORG ETA  ] terrorists and a leader of [ORG ETA  ] 's feared " [MISC Madrid Commando  ] " during the 1980s . 
He was captured in January 1987 and was convicted of killing 12 [ORG Civil Guards  ] and wounding 58 people in one attack , killing five [ORG Civil Guards  ] in another attack , and killing a [PER Navy Viceadmiral  ] in a third attack . 
[PER De Juana  ] is accused of involvement in as many as seven more deaths as well . 
In 1989 , he was convicted to a total of 2,655 years in prison , a symbolic punishment since he was convicted under the 1973 [ORG Penal Code  ] which allowed for a maximum of 30 years imprisonment. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) [PER De Juana  ] became eligible for release in 2005 under normal penal guidelines allowing prisoners to reduce their prison terms through " good behavior " and similar benefits . 
However , a [ORG National Court  ] magistrate blocked [PER De Juana  ] 's release in 2005 by charging him with making " terrorist threats " in two articles he authored for the radical [MISC Basque  ] daily " [ORG Gara  ] " near the end of his prison term . 
Also , although many [ORG ETA  ] terrorists had benefited from early release programs during the [PER Gonzalez  ] , [ORG Aznar  ] and [ORG Zapatero  ] administrations , [MISC Spanish  ] public opinion was strongly against [PER De Juana  ] 's release because of the number of his victims and because he had never expressed remorse. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) The new charges triggered a complex legal contest pitting prosecutors and police against [PER De Juana  ] and [ORG ETA  ] support groups , at a time when the [ORG Zapatero Government  ] was undertaking tenuous peace talks with [ORG ETA  ] . 
In November 2006 , the [ORG National Court  ] agreed with the new charges against [PER De Juana  ] and sentenced him to 12 more years in prison . 
On appeal , the [ORG Supreme Court  ] in February 2007 partially overturned his conviction and reduced his sentence to 3 years in prison for a single count of making terrorist threats . 
[ORG MADRID  ] 00000432 002.2 OF 004 This three-year term would have made him eligible for release in 12 to 18 months ( summer 2008 ) , under normal prison guidelines. //DE [PER JUANA  ] BECOMES AN [ORG ETA  ] HERO// <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) While the treatment of [ORG ETA  ] prisoners , and particularly their dispersal throughout [LOC Spain  ] , has long been a central issue for [ORG ETA  ] negotiators , the [PER De Juana  ] case did not gain special status until [PER De Juana  ] announced a hunger strike on August 8 to protest his continued incarceration . 
Observers in the [ORG Basque Region  ] reported rumors that [ORG ETA  ] leaders had opposed [PER De Juana  ] 's hunger strike out of concern that it would inflame [ORG ETA  ] supporters and complicate peace talks with the [ORG Zapatero Government  ] . 
[PER De Juana  ] abandoned his hunger strike in October , but initiated a second hunger strike on November 7 , a day after the [ORG National Court  ] sentenced him to a further 12 years in prison . 
His condition reportedly declined despite forced feeding by doctors , and in early February [PER De Juana  ] 's attorneys released pictures of him appearing emaciated and attached to IV tubes to keep him hydrated . 
Between August and February , [PER De Juana  ] became the most important symbol of [ORG ETA  ] resistance to [LOC Madrid  ] , particularly among the young [ORG ETA  ] hardliners who have reportedly taken over the organization and who were behind the December 30 attack at [LOC Barajas Airport  ] that killed two people. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) The February 12 decision of the [ORG Spanish Supreme Court  ] to reduce [PER De Juana  ] 's sentence from 12 years to 3 years paved the way for the [ORG Zapatero Government  ] to release him . 
The reduced final prison term made him eligible for release under special humanitarian guidelines for prisoners facing relatively short sentences . 
On February 28 , Minister of [ORG Interior  ] [PER Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba  ] approved the transfer of [PER De Juana  ] from a [LOC Madrid  ] prison hospital to a hospital in [LOC San Sebastian  ] , near [PER De Juana  ] 's home , as well as authorizing [PER De Juana  ] to complete the remainder of his prison term in his home under police and electronic surveillance once he has recovered enough to leave the hospital . 
In a press conference announcing the [ORG Government  ] 's decision to ease [PER De Juana  ] 's conditions , [PER Rubalcaba  ] emphasized the [ORG Government  ] 's determination that [PER De Juana  ] was near death , or at least on the point of suffering irreperable physical damage , and that the [ORG Government  ] 's decision was made on humanitarian grounds . 
Other [ORG Government  ] officials defended the decision as appropriate for an inmate with little more than a year left in his prison term , also noting that [PER De Juana  ] had expressed support for the [MISC Basque  ] peace process . 
A judge officially approved [PER Rubalcaba  ] 's decision on March 1 and [PER De Juana  ] arrived at a [LOC San Sebastian  ] hospital the same day to a hero 's welcome. //BASQUE EXTREMISTS CHEER VICTORY , [ORG PP  ] CONDEMNS RELEASE// <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) An [ORG ETA  ] prisoner support group quickly claimed a political victory for radical [MISC Basque  ] nationalists and urged the release of seven more [ORG ETA  ] prisoners who are in poor health . 
A representative of [ORG ETA  ] political front group " [ORG Batasuna  ] " demanded the immediate release of sick [ORG ETA  ] prisoners and the relocation to the [ORG Basque Region  ] of all other [ORG ETA  ] prisoners ( a long-standing [ORG Batasuna  ] demand ) . 
While some in [LOC Batasuna  ] and [ORG ETA  ] seem willing to downplay [PER De Juana  ] 's release to avoid embarrassing [ORG Zapatero  ] , most [ORG ETA  ] supporters clearly view the hunger strike as an effective weapon in negotiations with the [ORG Government  ] . 
Several prisoners ( including several common criminals ) have announced their own plans for hunger strikes. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) The [ORG PP  ] and groups representing victims of terrorism were quick to respond to news of [PER De Juana  ] 's release , denouncing the decision as tantamount to succumbing to [ORG ETA  ] blackmail . 
A [ORG PP  ] youth group staged an unauthorized demonstration in front of the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] the day [PER De Juana  ] 's release was announced and several " semi-spontaneous " demonstrations called by victims rights groups have taken place throughout the country , attracting several thousand people each . 
Several demonstrations have been marred by the participation of far-right [PER Francoist  ] and fascist groups . 
The [ORG PP  ] is organizing a massive protest march for March 10 ( by coincidence , the eve of third anniversary of the March 11 , 2004 [LOC Madrid  ] train attacks by [MISC Islamist  ] extremists ) under the motto " [LOC Spain  ] for Liberty - [MISC No More Concessions  ] to [ORG ETA  ] . 
" //ZAPATERO WALKING A FINE LINE// <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The [ORG Zapatero Government  ] understands that it has assumed a significant political risk , both in releasing [PER De Juana  ] and in continuing to seek peace with [ORG ETA  ] . 
Former Minister of Defense [PER Jose Bono  ] told the Ambassador that the [LOC MADRID  ] 00000432 003.2 OF 004 [ORG Zapatero Government  ] had determined that [PER De Juana  ] was truly near death and that his " martyrdom " would unleash a wave of [ORG ETA  ] violence and definitively derail the [MISC Basque  ] peace process . 
While releasing [PER De Juana  ] under pressure was certain to cost [ORG Zapatero  ] political support , [ORG Zapatero  ] and the [ORG PSOE  ] reportedly determined that [ORG ETA  ] 's resurgence would be far worse , both in terms of human lives and in political consequences . 
Though all senior [ORG PSOE  ] leaders , past and present , have expressed public support for [ORG Zapatero  ] 's decision on [PER De Juana  ] , [PER Bono  ] and former President [PER Gonzalez  ] were rumored to be adamantly opposed in private . 
During his tenure as MOD , [PER Bono  ] was outspoken in his opposition to [MISC Basque  ] nationalists. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The Government will soon face yet another political challenge: deciding whether to fight or support the participation of [ORG ETA  ] political group [ORG Batasuna  ] in [MISC Basque  ] municipal elections in May . 
Although many observers discarded any possibility of [ORG Batasuna  ] 's participation in elections after the December 30 airport attack , it now seems that [ORG Zapatero  ] and his advisers are inclined to support participation by [ORG Batasuna  ] , or its candidates running under another banner . 
A [ORG Batasuna  ] role in [MISC Basque  ] elections would be certain to draw relentless criticism by the [ORG PP  ] , and likely grumbling from within the [ORG PSOE  ] as well. //POLITICAL KNIVES SHARPENED// <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) While the [PER De Chaos  ] case will be the immediate cause , the [ORG PP  ] hopes its March 10 demonstration will convey widespread dissatisfaction with [ORG Zapatero  ] 's ETA/Basque policy and prove a political liability for the Socialists in the May 27 regional/municipal elections . 
Various polls conducted following the announcement of [PER De Juana  ] 's release indicate broad disgust with the decision . 
In a poll by [LOC Spain  ] 's second leading daily , " [PER El Mundo  ] , " 63 percent of respondents called [PER De Juana  ] 's release " Bad or Very Bad " and 63 percent ( including 58 percent of self-identified [ORG PSOE  ] voters ) said they expected [ORG Zapatero  ] 's decision would negatively affect the [ORG PSOE  ] in upcoming elections . 
A separate poll indicated strong public support ( 80 percent ) for tougher sentencing guidelines , but tracked with other polls in indicating that the [ORG PSOE  ] would still edge out the [ORG PP  ] the general elections ( scheduled to take place by March 2008 , but there is speculations that [ORG Zapatero  ] could call elections as early as November ) . <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [ORG Zapatero  ] and the [ORG PSOE  ] are countering [ORG PP  ] criticism by equating the [PER De Juana  ] decision to former President [ORG Aznar  ] 's decision to move a number of [ORG ETA  ] prisoners to the [ORG Basque Region  ] as part of 1998 negotiations with [ORG ETA  ] . 
The [ORG PSOE  ] has produced two videos detailing [ORG Aznar  ] administration overtures to [ORG ETA  ] and calling the current [ORG PP  ] attacks hypocritical . 
[ORG Zapatero  ] has also threatened to divulge previously " secret " [ORG PP  ] dealings with [ORG ETA  ] during the [ORG Aznar Government  ] , leading [ORG PP  ] figures to threaten to resurface the so-called " [PER GAL Case  ] , " the [ORG PSOE  ] 's dirty war against [ORG ETA  ] during the [ORG Gonzalez Government  ] . 
The political environment surrounding these various [ORG ETA  ] issues is likely to become even more volatile through the May 27 municipal/regional elections , and through the runup to the national elections in late 2007 or early <a id='par2008' href='#par2008'>¶</a>2008. //COMMENT// <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) As the [PER De Juana  ] episode makes clear , [ORG Zapatero  ] is willing to raise the ante in pursuit of avoiding violence and furthering the [MISC Basque  ] peace process , which he views as the central legacy of his administration . 
To a significant extent , he has placed his political future in [ORG ETA  ] 's hands . 
In fact , many within [ORG Zapatero  ] 's [ORG PSOE  ] ranks privately believe that these high stakes are unreasonable , particularly in the wake of the December 30 [ORG ETA  ] bombing at [LOC Barajas  ] airport . 
Nevertheless [ORG Zapatero  ] is counting on the [ORG PP  ] to fumble the opportunity and not be able to mount a successful challenge to the [ORG PSOE  ] 's leadership in the national elections - as long as [ORG ETA  ] violence is held in check . 
[ORG ETA  ] is doubtlessly aware that it holds the wildcard in those elections and will extract whatever concessions it can over the next several months . 
However , the [ORG Zapatero Government  ] cannot concede on core [ORG ETA  ] demands , such as [MISC Basque  ] self determination , and the key question is whether the Government will be able to do enough to stave off another [ORG ETA  ] blast , with its attendant political consequences . 
Thus far , the [ORG PP  ] and its leader [PER Mariano Rajoy  ] have not been able to gain substantial political momentum beyond their own core base , despite all of the issues surrounding [ORG Zapatero  ] 's [ORG ETA  ] policy - mainly because the [MISC Spanish  ] public views the [ORG PP  ] as too right wing and too associated with [ORG Aznar  ] 's perceived mistakes following the [LOC MADRID  ] 00000432 004.2 OF 004 March 11 , 2004 terrorist attacks in [LOC Madrid  ] .
