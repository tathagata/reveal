End Summary . 
Brown: “Use the Opportunity of [LOC Power”  ] ---------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) [ORG Labour’s Spring Conference  ] February 27-March 2 in [LOC Birmingham  ] , billed as the launching event for the May 1 local elections , featured a keynote speech by Prime Minister [PER Gordon Brown  ] intended to fire up the [ORG Labour  ] faithful . 
In the event , Brown’s speech , eloquent as it was in articulating his vision of the party’s purpose , failed to move the audience beyond more than polite applause . 
Opening with an admission that the last few months had been difficult , [PER Brown  ] talked about the series of challenges his government had faced as soon as it came into office: floods , foot and mouth disease , avian flu , and the global credit crunch . 
He made no mention of the decision not to go to early elections that precipitated [ORG Labour’s  ] plummeting poll numbers ( see ref ) . 
Instead , [PER Brown  ] talked about the global economy of the future , in which skilled workers and entrepreneurs would reap high-value returns , and declared that higher standards of education would equip [MISC Britons  ] to succeed in globalized future economy . 
He emphasized his view that poverty , particularly among children , was a “scar on [LOC Britain  ] , ” and he graphically listed the ways in which the denial of potential through inadequate health and education costs [LOC Britain  ] talent and achievement . 
A [ORG Labour  ] government that was “purposeful and progressive” ( [PER Brown  ] slipped and said “powerful and progressive” but corrected himself ) had to use the “opportunity of power” to bring the “power of opportunity” to those elements of [MISC British  ] society in need. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While Brown’s speech focused largely on domestic issues , he did extend his analysis to the costs of poverty to the rest of the world , noting that 72 million children have no access to schools , and vowing to eliminate diseases such as diphtheria , tuberculosis , and malaria . 
[PER Brown  ] called for an extension of sanctions on [LOC Sudan  ] and for the release of [MISC Burmese  ] dissident [PER Aung San Suu Kyi.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In a [LOC Q&A  ] session that followed Brown’s remarks , many of the questions from the audience had to do with the [ORG Labour  ] government’s management of school standards and health care - the bread and butter issues for [ORG Labour  ] members at the local level . 
( Embassy comment: Discussion of educational issues became rather detailed: one [LOC Birmingham  ] MP told [PER Poloff  ] that the [ORG “Labour Party  ] is made up of teachers , ” explaining that their parochial concerns tend to dominate party events . 
End comment . 
) Curiously , given media reports of an imminent possible rebellion against the government on pending security legislation to extend the legal detention period from 28 to 42 days , the subjects of terrorism , police powers , and civil liberties were not raised . 
And while [PER Brown  ] pounded the [ORG Conservative Party  ] on its plans for tax cuts and opposition to the [LOC Lisbon  ] Treaty’s plan for [ORG EU  ] reform , he made little reference to the upcoming battles for local councils in which the [ORG Liberal Democrat Party  ] poses as large a threat to [ORG Labour  ] as do the [MISC Tories  ] . 
A number of “Labour Students” from [LOC Cardiff  ] rose to say she had been eight years old when [ORG Labour  ] came to power , and asked what should she tell people now about what makes [ORG Labour  ] a radical force ? 
[PER Brown  ] reiterated his calls for ending poverty and eliminating disease globally . 
A [MISC Palestinian  ] asking what [PER Brown  ] would do to end the conflict in [LOC Palestine  ] provoked a rare outburst of applause ; [PER Brown  ] responded by noting a planned upcoming investment conference . 
[ORG Labour’s Financial Woes  ] ----------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) The lack of energy that hung like a pall over the keynote speech was evident elsewhere , either because of low attendance or the party’s financial woes . 
[ORG Labour  ] members groused that conference organizers had chosen a bad weekend -- [MISC Welsh  ] members stayed away to attend the March 1 [ORG St. David’s Day  ] festivities back home ( [LOC St. David  ] is the patron saint of [LOC Wales  ] and his feast day is a [MISC Welsh  ] nationalist obligation ) . 
And the March 2 observance of [ORG Mother’s Day  ] in [LOC Britain  ] put many prospective attendees in the position of choosing between the [ORG Labour Party  ] and their “mums.” Judging by the turnout , Mum won in many cases . 
[ORG Labour Party  ] workers , who have been living on a shoestring for the past several years , were scarce on the ground . 
Those who were present were not particularly motivated: asked for a copy of the Prime Minister’s speech , one party worker referred [PER Poloff  ] to the website version which , several hours later , had not yet been updated to reflect extensive changes in delivery . 
Some [ORG Labour  ] members , noting the party’s financial straits , asked why so much money had been spent on the [ORG Labour  ] deputy leader race in 2007 , noting that the money raised by the candidates would have been better spent to support the party’s local campaigns this year . 
Female Recruitment ------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Organized around three key themes , the [ORG Conference  ] focused on recruiting female candidates , improving communications with minority communities , and enhancing [ORG Labour’s  ] performance on local government . 
The three areas were selected with a view to preparing for local elections but there seemed to be a disconnect between the state of those efforts and the imminence of the May elections . 
Regarding women’s empowerment , MP [PER Barbara Follett  ] provided advice on presenting oneself effectively as a woman candidate to an audience of about 25 women that included only one prospective , not active , candidate . 
( Embassy comment: While [ORG Labour  ] rightly congratulates itself on having more female MPs that the [MISC Tories  ] , the recruitment/empowerment process at the conference appeared to be still in its early stages . 
End comment . 
) Local [ORG Labour  ] organizations and the trades unions , according to other speakers on women’s issues , are where women have to rise through the ranks without much help from the central party apparatus . 
Reaching out to [MISC Muslim  ] Voters ----------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Ten people ( including [PER Poloff  ] ) showed up at an event aimed at improving [ORG Labour  ] outreach to [MISC Muslim  ] communities . 
( Embassy comment: Given Labour’s loss of [MISC Muslim  ] support following the [MISC Iraq War  ] , the low turnout by party activists at this event was inexplicable . 
End comment . 
) [ORG Manchester Councilor  ] and former [PER Lord Mayor Afzal Khan  ] provided recommendations to [ORG Labour  ] candidates looking for votes in [MISC Muslim  ] communities , including: use “As [PER Salam Aleikum”  ] as a greeting ; don’t get hung up on shaking hands with females ; call into [MISC Muslim  ] radio programs ; send cards for [MISC Muslim  ] religious holidays ; and wait outside mosques on Friday to hand out leaflets . 
[ORG Labour  ] MEP [PER Gary Titley  ] from [LOC Bolton  ] also provided the earnest advice to avoid assuming that all [MISC Muslims  ] hold identical views and to maintain links with community-based organizations . 
One [MISC British Muslim  ] from [LOC Nottingham  ] rose to describe what he felt was suppression of a large [MISC Muslim  ] contingent in his local [ORG Labour  ] party ; [PER Khan  ] told him there was a democratic process and the [MISC Muslims  ] in [LOC Nottingham  ] should use it. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Secretary for Communities and Local Government [PER Hazel Blears  ] led the way on Labour’s achievements in local government . 
Birmingham’s revitalized town center , including the conference center that was the venue for the event , were held up as [ORG Labour  ] achievements , as was [ORG London Mayor  ] [PER Ken Livingstone’s  ] record in “revitalizing London.” In break out groups , however , there was one ominous session on “effective opposition.” [ORG Labour  ] members complained that for [ORG Labour  ] councilors - who are on the front lines , so to speak , against [MISC Tory  ] and [MISC LibDem-dominated  ] councils - there is little or no support from the party in either substantive policy terms or personal assistance . 
[ORG Miliband’s Star Power  ] --------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) In an otherwise low key conference , the frisson of excitement whenever Foreign Secretary [PER David Miliband  ] appeared was palpable . 
The [ORG European Parliament Labour Party  ] lunch-time event on the [ORG Lisbon Treaty  ] that featured [PER Miliband  ] as speaker drew a packed hall . 
He followed that appearance by a session with over a hundred [ORG Labour Students  ] who clearly idolized him . 
Stumbling into what was belatedly revealed as a “private session , ” [PER Poloff  ] heard [PER Miliband  ] outline his criteria for a “successful country” of the future: openness , empowerment of the whole population , and global linkages . 
There is increasingly less of a distinction between foreign and domestic policies , he told the students , and the challenge is to mobilize people to change . 
The lessons of the 80s and 90s are that “rainbow coalitions don’t work ; ” in order to mobilize “dynamic forces , ” political leaders must develop a unifying narrative or ideology . 
In this respect , [ORG Labour  ] must decide if it is the party of the working class or the party of the middle class . 
Answering questions on foreign policy , [PER Miliband  ] supported [ORG UN  ] reform and noted the “real issue” at the [ORG UN  ] is the UN’s failure to deliver on its “responsibility to protect , ” because most threats to civilians come from their own governments and not foreign invasions . 
He defended [LOC UK  ] participation in China’s [MISC Olympic  ] games as an opportunity to shine a light on “the real [LOC China  ] , warts and all.” He emphasized that [LOC Iran  ] represented dangers not just in nuclear weapons development and support for terrorism but also through its own domestic human rights practices ; for example , he noted that [LOC Iran  ] has the highest per capita rate of capital punishment in the world . 
Comment ------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C/NF ) [ORG Labour  ] members have been increasingly asking themselves the same question raised by the student from [ORG Cardiff:  ] what makes [ORG Labour  ] “radical” after nearly 11 years in government ? 
For a party that still contains a large element who feel more comfortable in opposition , such self-questioning contributes to a feeling of post-Blair rudderlessness . 
Even though [PER Blair  ] ended up unpopular , he was the sun around which the party orbited , and his speeches , no matter the content , sparked an emotional response . 
[PER Brown’s  ] earnest and praiseworthy vision excites no opposition and yet it seems to excite no great enthusiasm either . 
With two months to go before local elections , a financially-constrained [ORG Labour  ] hardly seemed on the verge of mobilizing for a campaign that will not only determine Labour’s fortunes on the local level , but may also affect [PER Gordon Brown’s  ] own tenure as leader . 
The poorly attended conference lacked the buzz that a strong parliamentary party representation would have provided and , Miliband’s star power notwithstanding , there was no catwalk of prospective challengers to [PER Brown  ] . 
But the irony of Labour’s holding up [PER Ken Livingstone  ] as a model of [ORG Labour  ] achievement , only eight years after his expulsion from the party for running for [LOC London  ] mayor as an independent , was not lost on the [LOC UK  ] media .
