( [ORG SBU  ] ) During a January 7 meeting with the Ambassador , former Minister of Finance [PER Antonio Delfim Netto  ] ( strictly protect ) , who is currently working as a political and business consultant , discussed the opposition 's victory over the government in a major tax battle and its implications for domestic politics and the 2010 presidential elections . 
[PER Delfim  ] also emphasized [LOC Brazil  ] 's focus on infrastructure development and said that the country will continue to pursue large-scale privatization efforts . 
On the subject of [LOC Brazil  ] 's relations with [LOC Venezuela  ] , [PER Delfim  ] stated that [PER Lula  ] is concerned about [PER Chavez  ] 's foreign policy agenda , especially his desire to annex one third of [LOC Guyana  ] 's territory . 
End Summary . 
CPMF Tax Defeat --------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Delfim  ] labeled the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Senate  ] 's December rejection of the renewal of the [ORG Provisional Financial Transactions Tax  ] ( CPMF - see ref B ) , as a significant defeat for the government alliance . 
In his view , the opposition worked to eliminate the tax , which was projected to generate 40 billion Reals ( about USD 23 billion ) in revenue in 2008 , in order to " starve the beast , " or attempt to control what government opponents see as unjustified public spending . 
In addition to the lost source of income that expiration of the CPMF will create , rejection represented a political setback for the [ORG Lula Administration  ] as the President expended significant political capital in supporting the continuation of this tax . 
The opposition is now mounting a legal challenge to the [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] 's efforts to compensate for anticipated revenue losses by raising the [ORG Financial Operations Tax  ] ( [ORG IOF  ] ) and Corporate Profits Tax ( CSLL ) contributions - which [PER Delfim  ] mentioned are in effect very small increases - in the [ORG Supreme Federal Tribunal  ] ( ref C ) . 
[PER Delfim  ] predicted that the court will rule against the government and find the [ORG IOF  ] and CSLL adjustments unconstitutional . 
Internal Politics and 2010 Presidential Elections --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Delfim  ] rebutted rumors that the CPMF defeat would lead to internal political fallout and stated that [PER Lula  ] is unlikely to replace [PER Guido Mantega  ] as Finance Minister because , even though [PER Mantega  ] is not a strong or independent minister , [PER Lula  ] and his main advisor , Civil Household Minister ( Chief of Staff equivalent ) [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] , would prefer to keep him on board . 
According to [PER Delfim  ] , [PER Lula  ] personally likes [PER Mantega  ] ; both he and [PER Rousseff  ] believe [PER Mantega  ] can be easily controlled and is a convenient scapegoat for [PER Lula  ] on politically unpopular issues , someone that [PER Lula  ] can use " like a pen " because [PER Mantega  ] , unlike some other ministers , does not question the president 's decisions . 
[PER Delfim  ] dispelled rumors that [LOC Belo Horizonte Mayor  ] [PER Fernando Pimentel  ] would replace [PER Mantega  ] ( ref B ) and further stated that [PER Lula  ] is not grooming [PER Pimentel  ] to become the presidential candidate of his [ORG Workers' Party  ] ( [ORG PT  ] ) in 2010 as some analysts have suggested . 
( Note: During a January 7 meeting with [ORG FIESP  ] , the [ORG Federation of Industries of Sao Paulo  ] President [PER Paulo Skaf  ] [ ref C ] , [PER Skaf  ] stated that he believed [PER Pimentel  ] would replace Minister [PER Mantega  ] this year as a stepping stone to becoming Governor of [ORG Minas Gerais  ] . 
[LOC SAO PAULO  ] 00000019 002 OF 004 End Note . 
) [PER Delfim  ] said [PER Lula  ] 's preferred successor would be Minister [PER Rousseff  ] or [ORG Social Development  ] and [ORG Hunger Combat Minister  ] [PER Patrus Ananias  ] , but noted that neither is actually apt to win the election . 
[PER Delfim  ] stated instead that [LOC Sao Paulo  ] Governor [PER Jose Serra  ] of the opposition [ORG Social Democracy party  ] ( [ORG PSDB  ] ) is most likely to become [LOC Brazil  ] 's next president . 
[ORG Infrastructure Development and Privatization  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Delfim  ] acknowledged that the 2010 elections might also have an impact on infrastructure investment , which will continue to increase by at least 1.5 percent of GDP in 2008 . 
Governor [PER Serra  ] is expected to push privatization in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] State , especially in the road and energy sectors , as a means of both boosting economic growth and enhancing his credentials as a market reformer in the run-up to the 2010 elections . 
Besides calling for a large road construction expansion program , [PER Serra  ] is also working actively with the [ORG Inter-American Development Bank  ] ( [ORG IDB  ] ) to promote private-sector infrastructure investment . 
[PER Serra  ] 's probable primary opponent in the national elections of 2010 , [ORG Minas Gerais  ] Governor [PER Aecio Neves  ] , is looking to carry out similar policies in his own state to viably compete with [PER Serra  ] on the economic development front , [PER Delfim  ] said. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Minister [PER Rousseff  ] is a key player in further driving infrastructure development , [PER Delfim  ] said . 
[PER Rousseff  ] has become a stronger supporter of private sector investment in the aftermath of [LOC Brazil  ] 's successful road concessions in October 2007 . 
Her present position is a significant change because [PER Rousseff  ] , an erstwhile leftist militant described by [PER Delfim  ] as the " most important person in [LOC Brazil  ] 's government " after the president , has an overwhelming amount of influence on [LOC Brazil  ] 's national agenda . 
Although [PER Rousseff  ] continues to harbor suspicions about the private sector - [PER Delfim  ] stated that [PER Rousseff  ] believes [MISC Brazilian  ] business is run like a " cartel and always has tricks up its sleeve " - she now sees the benefits of non-government investment . 
[MISC Spanish  ] firms , with active support from [LOC Spain  ] 's government which , according to [PER Delfim  ] , practices an " aggressive industrial policy , " are likely to be the largest foreign investors in [MISC Brazilian  ] infrastructure . 
With respect to [LOC Brazil  ] 's ongoing civil aviation crisis , [PER Delfim  ] predicted that [PER Rousseff  ] will support privatizing some of the country 's airports , a move which could be the beginning of a larger privatization process encompassing such areas as railroads and ports . 
Further Economic Views ---------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Delfim  ] stated that Minister [PER Mantega  ] 's proposal to establish a [MISC Brazilian  ] sovereign wealth fund is a " terrible idea " and is unlikely to materialize because [MISC Brazilian  ] foreign reserves are inadequate and will not grow by a sufficient amount over the next year due to a decline in [LOC Brazil  ] 's terms-of-trade . 
[PER Delfim  ] added that [LOC Brazil  ] 's exchange rate ( approximately 1.75 Reals per [LOC U.S.  ] Dollar ) is currently overvalued which has a significant impact on the current account balance . 
Turning to [LOC WTO Doha Round  ] negotiations , [PER Delfim  ] remarked that the talks will not succeed because all countries negotiating trade agreements want self-sufficiency in food production and he does not expect the [LOC United States  ] to make adequate concessions in the agricultural sector to conclude a [LOC Doha  ] agreement . 
[LOC SAO PAULO  ] 00000019 003 OF 004 [LOC Venezuela  ] 's Relations with its Neighbors ---------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Brazil  ] 's relations with [LOC Venezuela  ] are tense and deteriorating , but [PER Lula  ] is seeking to avoid an open confrontation that could cause a serious rupture in bilateral relations and have an impact on the continent as a whole , [PER Delfim  ] said . 
He stated that [PER Lula  ] 's presidency represents an " important inflection point " for [LOC Brazil  ] because [PER Lula  ] is the first [MISC Brazilian  ] president " to put poverty on [LOC Brazil  ] 's economic agenda in a serious way . 
" Having come from a poor background himself , [PER Lula  ] understands the implications of growing up among a vastly neglected part of society . 
[PER Delfim  ] characterized [PER Lula  ] as someone who " believes deeply in [MISC South American  ] unity " and thinks [MISC Latin American  ] poverty brings the region 's people together , enabling them to resolve conflicts through negotiation . 
[PER Delfim  ] , who stated his opposition to [LOC Venezuela  ] 's entry in [LOC Mercosul  ] , said that [PER Hugo Chavez  ] is a " psychopath " ( while [PER Evo Morales  ] is just a " poor man " ) but that [PER Lula  ] does not want to alienate the [MISC Venezuelan  ] leader . 
[PER Lula  ] is worried about [LOC Venezuela  ] 's " serious " border problems with its neighbors , particularly [LOC Colombia  ] and [LOC Guyana  ] . 
[PER Chavez  ] has his sights on " one third " of [LOC Guyana  ] 's territory , and if [LOC Venezuela  ] were to invade [LOC Guyana  ] , [LOC Caracas  ] would likely militarize all of [LOC Venezuela  ] 's south , antagonizing the indigenous populations there . 
( Comment: Former President and sitting Senator [PER Jose Sarney  ] has expressed similar concerns with regard to [PER Chavez  ] 's designs on [LOC Guyana  ] , per reftels D and [PER E. End  ] comment . 
) [PER Delfim  ] said this will have an impact on [LOC Brazil  ] because the territories of at least one tribe , the [PER Yanomami Indians  ] spills over the [MISC Venezuela-Brazil  ] border . 
[PER Delfim  ] believes that , should [LOC Venezuela  ] invade [LOC Guyana  ] , the Yanomamis will declare independence , forcing [LOC Brazil  ] to get involved in a [LOC Venezuela-Guyana  ] war . 
Comment ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Considered by analysts to be one of [LOC Brazil  ] 's most influential economic commentators , [PER Delfim  ] supported [PER Lula  ] 's re-election bid and is said to meet with him regularly to provide informal economic advice . 
At the beginning of [PER Lula  ] 's second term , he was expected to be appointed to a Cabinet position or as head of the [ORG Brazilian Development Bank  ] ( [ORG BNDES  ] ) . 
While some of his views come across as exaggerated , unorthodox , or idiosyncratic , his long experience and knowledge of the players afford him unique insight into machinations and conflicts involving the government and opposition .
