[ORG KUSA ENCOURAGES INCREASED  ] PRESSURE FOR UNIFICATION 2 . 
( C ) In an October 8 meeting with Foreign Minister-equivalent [PER Musa Kusa  ] , SE [PER Gration  ] outlined his overall strategy for [LOC Sudan  ] and thanked [PER Kusa  ] for [LOC Libya  ] 's interventions to find a political resolution to the [MISC Chad-Sudan  ] conflict and to unify splintered factions of the [ORG Sudan Liberation Army  ] ( [ORG SLA  ] ) . 
He said he appreciated [PER Kusa  ] 's assistance in facilitating the travel of [ORG Addis Ababa-based SLA  ] leaders to [LOC Tripoli  ] in an effort to promote their unification in advance of the re-launch of the [LOC Doha  ] process slated for October 28 ( Note: This date has since slipped to mid-November as the [PER Joint-Chief Mediator  ] announced that he needed to be present at the [ORG African Union 's Peace and Security Council Meeting in Abuja  ] , [LOC Nigeria  ] schedule for the end of October . 
End note . 
) . 
[PER Gration  ] said his purpose in [LOC Libya  ] was three-fold: to ensure that [LOC Libya  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] presented a united position to the rebels , to work on facilitating the rebels' participation in a unification conference , and to make sure no new factions were created as a byproduct of [ORG SLA  ] unification . 
3 . 
( C ) [PER Kusa  ] expressed gratitude for SE [PER Gration  ] 's attention to the [LOC Darfur  ] issue and his consultations with [MISC Libyan  ] officials handling the portfolio . 
As a neighboring country , [LOC Libya  ] " feels the depth " of the suffering caused by the [LOC Darfur  ] conflict , and appreciates the seriousness with which the [LOC U.S.  ] has approached the crisis . 
Other international actors , [PER Kusa  ] said , lacked the capacity and the knowledge to achieve results . 
[PER Kusa  ] encouraged SE [PER Gration  ] to push the " apathetic " faction leaders to quickly resolve the conflict with [LOC Khartoum  ] . 
He said that some , including [PER Ahmed Abdel Shafi  ] , sought international sympathy and attention and were more interested in staying in " five-star hotels " and being shuttled from capital to capital . 
Unification and peace talks , [PER Kusa  ] said , would end the benefits that some rebel leaders have come to enjoy . 
4 . 
( C ) [PER Kusa  ] expressed concern about the effect of [LOC Darfur  ] 's lingering [ORG IDP  ] and refugee problems on regional security , calling for greater international monitoring and reporting . 
Without internal security in [LOC Darfur  ] , [PER Kusa  ] saw little opportunity for [MISC Internally Displaced People  ] ( IDPs ) and refugees to return to their homes and resume their lives . 
This , in turn , exacerbated regional security concerns and compounded the challenge of humanitarian relief . 
[PER Kusa  ] was particularly concerned with the smuggling , arms traffic , and extremism that was fed by the instability in [LOC Darfur  ] . 
Characterizing the the janjaweed as [MISC Islamic  ] extremists , [PER Kusa  ] reported that the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG External Security Organization  ] had interdicted several smuggling groups with ties to [MISC Islamist  ] groups in [LOC Algeria  ] . 
5 . 
( C ) SE [PER Gration  ] agreed that more attention needed to be paid to the situation in [ORG IDP  ] camps and preparations made for eventual returns and reconstruction . 
Laying out the timetable of important events -- the renewal of [LOC Doha  ] talks and the November start of voter registration in preparation for the national elections in the spring of 2010 -- [PER Gration  ] cautioned that any gains would be fragile . 
He asked that [LOC Libya  ] continue to apply pressure on [ORG JEM  ] , [PER Abdul Wahid Nur  ] , and " anyone with technicals and guns " to prevent spoilers from affecting the unification process . 
[PER Gration  ] argued that the conditions were ripe for quick unification: [LOC Sudan  ] seemed increasingly serious about peace talks while [LOC Chad  ] President [PER Idriss Deby  ] was growing tired of [ORG JEM  ] 's tactics . 
The unique window of opportunity , however , should not lead to a rushed pact between groups that had no roots and would dissolve before serious negotiations with [LOC Khartoum  ] could take place . 
6 . 
( C ) [PER Kusa  ] and SE [PER Gration  ] agreed that [PER Khalil Ibrahim  ] had designs of national leadership and would attempt to disrupt any push for unity among [ORG SLA  ] factions . 
[PER Kusa  ] assessed that [PER Khalil  ] had the same mentality as [PER Turabi  ] and was essentially a member of [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000874 002.2 OF 002 the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood.  ] xxxxxxxxxxxx Saying that [LOC Libya  ] had to give [PER Khalil  ] some aid to ensure he would continue his relationship with the [LOC GOL  ] , he said both [LOC Libya  ] and [PER Deby  ] would need to pressure him to cooperate . 
7 . 
( C ) [PER Kusa  ] closed the meeting by reiterating [LOC Libya  ] 's gratitude for the productive relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] on the [LOC Sudan  ] conflict . 
[PER Kusa  ] said he hoped to establish a broader dialogue with the [LOC U.S.  ] on a range of [MISC African  ] issues , and would welcome visits from other [LOC U.S.  ] officials in this regard . 
8 . 
( U ) SE [PER Gration  ] cleared this message .
