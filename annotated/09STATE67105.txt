( [ORG S//NF  ] ) Alleged plans by various insurgent groups to conduct attacks during anticipated [LOC U.S.  ] military withdrawal from urban areas: According to recent multiple source reports , various insurgent groups and militias intend on attacking multiple venues throughout [LOC Iraq  ] in anticipation of [LOC U.S.  ] military forces withdrawal from urban areas . 
Specific targets mentioned included the [ORG International Zone  ] ( [ORG IZ  ] ) , [ORG Victory Base Complex  ] , joint security stations , and various forward operating bases in [LOC Baghdad  ] and in [LOC Maysan Province  ] ( southern [LOC Iraq  ] ) . 
Allegedly , insurgent groups also are prepared to target key infrastructure , such as bridges and major supply routes used by Coalition forces ( [ORG CF  ] ) and [ORG Iraqi Security Forces  ] ( [ORG ISF  ] ) convoys . 
According to one source , an unidentified group had access to a large tank of chlorine , 16 [MISC V-8  ] rockets , and three torpedoes which were supposedly recovered by the [ORG CF  ] and [ORG ISF  ] . 
The reports mentioned the attacks would commence on or about July 1 . 
The Government of [LOC Iraq  ] is anticipating the offensive and has placed [ORG ISF  ] units on alert and cancelled all leave effective June 28. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [ORG DS/TIA/ITA  ] would like to note the series of reports are consistent with other recent threat reporting indicating the possibility of insurgent groups and militias preparing to increase attacks in anticipation of troop withdrawal from urban areas . 
It is possible that extremist-affiliated groups would seek to target the [ORG IZ  ] and the [ORG Victory Base Complex  ] , as the venues are symbolic of the [LOC U.S.  ] diplomatic and military presence in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
It is also plausible the groups may surmise that a large attack against [ORG CF  ] troops in these areas would be ideal , as it would serve as propaganda for them , allowing them to take credit for driving out " occupying forces . 
" <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [ORG DS/TIA/ITA  ] would also highlight the allegation of the existence of the weapons cache , as the materials could possibly be used as components for improvised rocket-assisted munitions or an improvised explosive device ( [ORG IED  ] ) . 
According to the [ORG Multi-National Forces  ] in [LOC Iraq  ] Combined Intelligence Operations Cell , the first documented chlorine attack occurred in [LOC al-Anbar Province  ] ( western [LOC Iraq  ] ) on October 21 , 2006 , and the first documented chlorine vehicle-borne [ORG IED  ] ( [ORG VBIED  ] ) in the [LOC Baghdad  ] area occurred in [LOC Taji  ] on February 20 , <a id='par2007' href='#par2007'>¶</a>2007 . 
Despite the claims by insurgent groups and militias of chlorine-related attacks , their incident rates remain low and inconsistent . 
While [ORG DS/TIA/ITA  ] cannot corroborate the veracity of the recent threat reporting , overall , there is nothing to suggest that the intention to attack the [LOC U.S.  ] presence in [LOC Iraq  ] will subside once a military troop withdrawal is completed .

( C ) WHA [LOC Honduras  ] - [MISC Honduran  ] military forces arrested President [PER Manuel Zelaya  ] June 28 according to orders issued by the [ORG National Congress  ] and the [ORG Supreme Court of Honduras  ] . 
[PER Zelaya  ] was taken to a local air force base and flown to [LOC Costa Rica  ] . 
Emergency Action Committee ( [ORG EAC  ] ) [LOC Tegucigalpa  ] subsequently met to discuss the ramifications of the seizure of the president by host-cost country military forces . 
The [ORG RSO  ] noted the general climate in the capital was calm ; however , a standfast order was issued , and additional security measures were implemented . 
The [MISC Embassy  ] released a [ORG Warden Message  ] regarding the actions against [PER Zelaya  ] and urged AmCits to remain in the residences or hotels for the day. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Later in the day , [ORG Congress  ] officially named [PER Roberto Micheletti  ] interim president . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] Ambassador gave a press conference outside the [MISC Embassy  ] ; he insisted that President [PER Zelaya  ] was the only democratically elected president of the country and urged that freedom of expression and circulation be restored . 
He also demanded the release of those government officials said to be in military custody . 
The [ORG EAC  ] reconvened to assess the situation . 
Protest activity has centered around the presidential palace , some roads in the capital were blocked , and there were some troops on the street . 
However , traffic flow was reported normal in most of the city . 
Authorized Departure for family members was discussed , but not warranted at this time . 
Embassy personnel were advised to remain in their homes for the rest of the day and to limit their movements today , June 29 . 
All Peace Corps volunteers have been accounted for and are on standfast . 
Post will be open today for emergency services only . 
The [ORG EAC  ] will continue monitoring events in-country and provide updated information as available .

The guard notified his supervisor , and the area and two nearby apartment buildings were evacuated . 
Responding police requested canine and [ORG Explosive Ordnance Disposal  ] ( [ORG EOD  ] ) support . 
After the [ORG EOD  ] team arrived , a local telecom technician , who had been working nearby , arrived at the scene and claimed the unattended cases ; the technician had inadvertently left the cases . 
After further investigation and corroboration with the technician , police declare the area safe .

( [ORG SBU  ] ) AF [LOC Liberia  ] - Two acts of vandalism were reported to [LOC U.S.  ] [LOC Embassy Monrovia  ] on the night of June 27 . 
One took place at the residence of the chief of the [ORG DoD Office of Security Cooperation  ] , approximately 2.5 miles from Post , where graffiti was spray painted on the perimeter wall stating , " COL THE WAR HAS JUST BEGAN . 
" The second incident occurred at the facility of a USAID-funded project , approximately 1.5 miles from the [MISC Embassy  ] , where the messages " [ORG INTERCON MUST LEAVE NOW  ] , TAKE INT " and " DANGER " were spray painted on the compound wall . 
The [ORG RSO  ] assesses these incidents are consistent with the pattern of threats and intimidation used by dismissed [MISC Embassy  ] guards to obtain a favorable settlement with their former employer through the [ORG Liberian Ministry of Labor  ] .

The [ORG RSO  ] considers the information credible and made notifications to staff to assure that all official [MISC Americans  ] were accounted for . 
All residential [ORG LGF  ] posts were manned , and radio checks were increased . 
Post also issued a [ORG Warden Message  ] advising AmCits in-country of the threat .

Members were updated on the investigative progress of local authorities . 
The [ORG EAC  ] reviewed the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Embassy  ] 's tripwires for consideration of Authorized Departure and/or drawdown and determined there was insufficient information at this time to recommend either action . 
[ORG EAC  ] members were reminded of the importance of random arrival arrivals at Post ( effective June 25 ) along with other augmented security measures. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [LOC S//NF  ] ) The [ORG EAC  ] reconvened June 28 , and members were introduced to [ORG FBI  ] assets assigned to investigate the [ORG AmCit  ] 's murder with host-country law enforcement personnel . 
Members welcomed the team and support their efforts on the investigation while in-country . 
Members also discussed the credible kidnapping threat against an [ORG AmCit  ] in-country and reviewed the enhanced security measures already in place . 
Post issued a Consular short message system alert to the [MISC American  ] community advising of the threat . 
The [ORG EAC  ] will continue to review all threat information as it becomes available , while supporting the ongoing murder investigation , and the [ORG EAC  ] will reconvene as needed .

The threat was traced to [LOC Algeria  ] , and , although such threats are considered relatively common , Post officials are taking the threat seriously . 
Members agreed that Post 's current security upgrades were sufficient to deter and , if need be , withstand an attack ; however , members deemed it would be prudent to request additional security from the [LOC Republic of Yemen Government  ] at Post 's perimeter , in light of the approaching July 4 holiday .

( [ORG S//NF  ] ) AF [LOC Mauritania  ] - [ORG AQIM  ] threat to kidnap [MISC American  ] citizen: According to the [ORG Spanish National Intelligence Service  ] ( [ORG CNI  ] ) , an unidentified source for the [ORG CNI  ] service center stated al-Qa'ida in the Lands of the [MISC Islamic  ] [ORG Maghreb  ] ( [ORG AQIM  ] ) planned to kidnap an unidentified [ORG AmCit  ] in [LOC Nouakchott  ] during the evening of June 27 . 
According to the report 's context statement , a [ORG CNI  ] official provided the information during the course of a routine liaison meeting . 
There are no additional details on this information , and the report 's originators are unable to assess the reliability of the ultimate source ( s ) of the information . 
In addition , it is not known what , if any , vetting or validation procedures the [MISC Spanish  ] service may use to evaluate its sources . 
In separate reporting , [ORG AQIM  ] , as of late June , had sent three unidentified members to [LOC Mauritania  ] from northern [LOC Mali  ] to conduct operations against government interests in [LOC Nouakchott  ] and [LOC Nouadhibou  ] , according to the [MISC Mauritanian  ] [ORG External Intelligence Service  ] . 
It was unknown , according to the [MISC Mauritanian  ] service , whether [ORG AQIM  ] intended to attack [MISC Mauritanian  ] and/or foreign government facilities in those cities . 
Separately , [ORG AQIM  ] Tariq Ibn [PER Ziyad  ] battalion leader 'Abd al-Hamid ( [PER Abu Zaid  ] ) , as of late June , had delayed an order for four men to travel to [LOC Nouakchott  ] to conduct unspecified operations , according to the [MISC Mauritanian  ] service . 
[ORG DS/TIA/ITA  ] notes the latest threat information follows last week 's killing of an [MISC American  ] in [LOC Nouakchott  ] and the possible involvement of [ORG AQIM  ] .

( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [LOC Nigeria  ] - Extremists believed to be planning a massive terrorist attack: ( [LOC S//REL  ] TO [LOC USA  ] , [LOC FVEY  ] ) Tearline states , " Unspecified extremist groups , suspected to be operating in concert with [MISC Nigerian  ] Shi'ites , [LOC Salafiya  ] , or [PER Muhammad Yusuf  ] 's [MISC Nigerian  ] [ORG Taliban  ] are reportedly planning to launch a massive surprise attack on some piece of critical infrastructure or against high-profile targets within [LOC Nigeria  ] . 
Probable targets of this attack include top [MISC Nigerian  ] Government officials or security agents . 
Members of the general public , who might be opposed to the attackers' doctrines , were also believed to be possible targets . 
This planned attack is reportedly aimed at sparking sectarian clashes across [LOC Nigeria  ] . 
" <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [ORG DS/TIA/ITA  ] cannot immediately corroborate the current threat with additional intelligence . 
While no connection can be made between this threat and previous reports , [ORG DS/TIA/ITA  ] is concerned about recent activity surrounding extremists associated with the [MISC Nigerian  ] [ORG Taliban.  ] <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) A well-trained veteran [MISC Chadian  ] extremist , [PER Abu-Mahjin  ] ( Terrorist [ORG Identities Datamart Environment  ] ( TIDE ) number 24350378 ) , who has limited ties to al-Qa'ida associates , recently traveled to [LOC Nigeria  ] . 
He may be planning to conduct or facilitate a terrorist operation . 
Indeed , tearline from May 1 claimed , " An [MISC Islamic  ] extremist named [MISC Abu-Muhjin  ] has recently been in northeast [LOC Nigeria  ] . 
It is likely that he will be joined by other [MISC Islamic  ] extremists in the coming weeks . 
" More recent tearline stated , " [MISC Nigerian-based  ] probable [MISC Chadian  ] extremist [PER Abu-Mahjin  ] is keen to obtain more funds in connection with some sort of nefarious activity ( possibly terrorism related ) he is engaged in . 
However , it is not clear when he will receive this additional finance .

( [ORG S//NF  ] ) Though neither the [MISC Nigerian  ] [ORG Taliban  ] nor its more militant subset -- [ORG Tanzim  ] al-Qa'ida group -- has ever attacked [MISC Western  ] interests , they have discussed targeting foreign embassies in the past . 
In 2007 , they reportedly plotted to attack the [LOC U.S.  ] , [MISC British  ] , and [MISC Israeli  ] embassies in [LOC Abuja  ] , according to a single source that remains unsubstantiated .

The message was posted in [MISC Arabic  ] and appeared to originate in [LOC Algeria  ] . 
The writer warned of a " big attack against your embassies in [LOC Algeria  ] and [LOC Yaman  ] by suicide car on 29/06/2009 " and claimed to be an agent of the [ORG Algerian Intelligence Service  ] . 
The writer provided an apparent telephone number for confirming his information and warned , " The second attack what you will see it is in [PER Hassi Messaud  ] in [LOC Sahara  ] by a big number of terrorists . 
" The report 's originators note that they have no further information to corroborate the information , and the source may have intended to annoy , mislead , or disrupt rather than to provide legitimate information . 
The originators further note that the vast majority of such information is not true , but , since volunteers have provided authentic leads on occasion , the information is provided for evaluation purely due to its threat content .

( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [LOC Yemen  ] - [ORG Al-Qa'ida  ] possibly planning Embassy attacks: ( [LOC S//REL  ] TO [LOC USA  ] , [LOC FVEY  ] ) According to tearline information , " [MISC Saudi  ] authorities learned in late June that al-Qa'ida may be planning an attack on [MISC Western  ] and [LOC Middle Eastern  ] embassies in [LOC Yemen  ] . 
There was no additional information on the timing or exact location of the planned attack . 
" <a id='par32' href='#par32'>¶</a>32 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [ORG DS/TIA/ITA  ] notes this report is likely related to recent information provided by a [MISC Yemeni  ] security official in late June regarding possible unspecified al-Qa'ida in the [LOC Arabian Peninsula  ] ( [ORG AQAP  ] ) attacks against the embassies of the [LOC U.S  ] , [LOC Qatar  ] , [LOC United Arab Emirates  ] , [LOC Oman  ] , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , and unnamed [MISC European  ] nations in [LOC Sana'a  ] .

( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [ORG DS/TIA/ITA  ] also notes the continuing [ORG AQAP  ] threat to [MISC Western  ] and host-nation interests both in [LOC Sana'a  ] and throughout [LOC Yemen  ] . 
Previous [ORG AQAP  ] attacks illustrate a willingness and capability to target [MISC Western  ] citizens and diplomatic facilities , highlighted by the brazen attack against [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy [LOC Sana'a  ] in mid-September 2008 . 
The lack of host-nation political will to combat [ORG AQAP  ] contributes to an extremely permissive operating environment for extremist elements , suggesting threat reporting against [LOC U.S.  ] and other foreign interests in [LOC Yemen  ] will continue in both the near and medium term .

( [ORG S//NF  ] ) While the [ORG Taliban  ] operatives named in this report are indeed active in and around [LOC Kandahar  ] city to include involvement in kidnapping plots , [ORG DS/TIA/ITA  ] questions the source 's access to operational plans by the [ORG Taliban  ] . 
In past reporting , the source has reported primarily on [ORG Taliban  ] member atmospherics and movements in southern [LOC Afghanistan  ] and only occasionally on threats . 
[ORG DS/TIA/ITA  ] assesses information provided by the source regarding the January 2008 kidnapping of an [MISC American  ] non-governmental organization ( [ORG NGO  ] ) worker to be inaccurate. <a id='par36' href='#par36'>¶</a>36 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) That said , periodic reporting indicates extremists remain keen to abduct another [MISC Westerner  ] in [LOC Kandahar  ] city , possibly while traveling to/from [LOC Kandahar  ] Airfield . 
Tearline states , " [ORG Taliban  ] insurgents reportedly planned in late January to kidnap a [LOC U.S.  ] national as he traveled between [LOC Kandahar  ] Airfield and [PER Shur Andam Pass  ] , [ORG Kandahar Province  ] . 
" Reporting from November 2008 alleged the [ORG Taliban  ] planned to kidnap two foreign women possibly from their residence in northeast [LOC Kandahar  ] city or at the [LOC Rang Rezano  ] market they frequented. <a id='par37' href='#par37'>¶</a>37 .

" <a id='par39' href='#par39'>¶</a>39 . 
( [ORG S//FGI//NF  ] ) [ORG DS/TIA/ITA  ] assesses the [ORG Mumtaz Group  ] may be a reference to operations linked to al-Qa'ida leader [PER Hamza al-Jawfi  ] ( a.k.a . 
[ORG Mumtaz  ] ; TIDE number 70390 ) who died in a late-February explosion in [LOC North Waziristan  ] . 
[ORG Mumtaz  ] is an oft-used alias by senior al-Qa'ida leaders that is arguably inauspicious . 
The now-deceased [PER Hamzah Rabi  ] and [PER Abu Khabab  ] al-Masri both used this alias as well . 
Worryingly , the other operatives [ORG DS/TIA/ITA  ] suspects belong to this group are linked to ongoing , credible planning against [LOC Peshawar  ] cantonment as well as [MISC American  ] personnel and convoys belonging to [LOC U.S.  ] Consulate [ORG Peshawar.  ] <a id='par40' href='#par40'>¶</a>40 . 
( [ORG S//FGI//NF  ] ) Although al-Jawfi is dead , it is possible the operations referenced can be linked to al-Jawfi 's former courier and [PER Imran  ] ( TIDE number 14399906 ) , who collaborates closely with [PER Mohmand Agency-based  ] Tehrik-e-Taliban [LOC Pakistan  ] ( [ORG TTP  ] ) commander [PER Hakimullah Mahsud  ] . 
Early-April reporting from [ORG Inter-Services Intelligence  ] ( [ORG ISI  ] ) links [PER Imran  ] -- described as an [PER Uzbeki  ] militant responsible for the November 12 , 2008 , murder of a USAID contractor and the August 26 , 2008 , ambush of the principal officer 's ( [ORG PO  ] 's ) vehicle in [LOC Peshawar  ] -- to [ORG TTP  ] operative [ORG Faruq  ] 's ongoing planning for an attack on [LOC Peshawar  ] 's cantonment using multiple suicide operatives . 
[ORG Faruq  ] is also likely involved in conducting al-Qa'ida-linked operational surveillance against the [ORG PO  ] of [LOC U.S.  ] Consulate [LOC Peshawar  ] , a four-vehicle SUV protective convoy , and a vehicle workshop also affiliated with Post . 
Of note , however , [ORG ISI  ] reported the capture of an individual named [PER Imran  ] in mid-June ; although , it cannot be confirmed if this is the same [PER Uzbeki Imran  ] mentioned in earlier reporting .

( [ORG S//FGI//NF  ] ) [LOC Pakistan  ] - Threats against [LOC Punjab  ] and [ORG Islamabad: Reporting  ] continues to circulate detailing ongoing plans by [MISC Pakistani  ] extremists to launch suicide operations in [ORG Punjab Province  ] and [LOC Islamabad  ] . 
In [LOC Islamabad  ] , threats specify the targeting of embassies located in the [MISC F-6/2  ] sector , police post [LOC Aabpara  ] in [LOC Islamabad  ] , the [PER Imam Bargah  ] in [LOC G-6/2  ] , Senator [PER Tariq Azim  ] , and [PER Barri Imam Shrine  ] . 
In [LOC Lahore  ] and greater [ORG Punjab Province  ] , suicide operatives may seek to strike against foreigners in crowded areas or the [ORG Barbar Data Sahib  ] Shrine . 
Although it remains unclear if these named targets are an accurate reflection of extremists' operational plans , it is of note late-June reporting also mentions the cultivation and use of sympathetic madrassas and extremists located in targeted cities to carry out future attacks. <a id='par42' href='#par42'>¶</a>42 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) As of late June , [ORG TTP  ] reportedly tasked [PER Abdul Malik Mujahid  ] to launch suicide attacks against unspecified foreigners in crowded places in [LOC Punjab  ] , with [PER Mujahid  ] considering the use of sympathetic madrassas as shelter prior to conducting an attack . 
Madrassas under consideration included the [PER Jami Ashrafia  ] and [ORG Jamiat  ] ul-Manzur ul-Islami in [LOC Lahore  ] . 
Separately , tearline from late June reports , " Militant commander [PER Khan Bahadur  ] , son of [PER Sher Bahadur  ] , is the local militant commander in the [LOC Watkai  ] area . 
[PER Bahadur  ] currently may be residing in [LOC Islamabad  ] , while reorganizing his group to operate in difference parts of [LOC Pakistan  ] , as of June 25 . 
" Although there is limited information regarding the identity of [PER Khan Bahadur  ] ( possible TIDE number 238258 ) , earlier sensitive intelligence suggests he has served as an interlocutor in urban areas for [MISC Waziristan-based  ] militants since 2007 . 
According to late-January 2008 tearline , " .. . 
A [PER Khan Bahadur  ] ( or Bhadur ) in [LOC Lahore  ] was involved in efforts to arrange talks and perhaps a government announcement for a cease-fire and helping coordinate a separate announcement from the [ORG Mujahidin  ] , hopefully by October 13... .

( [ORG S//FGI//NF  ] ) As underscored by the events during and following the [LOC Lal Masjid  ] ( [ORG Red Mosque  ] ) confrontation in [LOC Islamabad  ] in July 2007 , the continued existence of networks in [LOC Islamabad  ] that can organize and facilitate protests and terrorist activity in the vicinity of the capital is indeed troubling . 
Notably , a body of intelligence reporting preceding the [LOC Lal Masjid  ] confrontation suggests [MISC Pakistan-based  ] extremists viewed the brewing tension between the madrassas and [LOC Islamabad  ] one part of a larger comprehensive effort to re-energize and expand their jihadi operations from their strongholds in the tribal areas and [ORG Northwest Frontier Province  ] . 
Interestingly , reporting from May 2007 citing a commander 10 corps lieutenant also noted 70 mosques in and around [LOC Islamabad  ] would likely support extremist activity associated with the now-infamous [PER Lal Masjid  ] , which was also an unauthorized mosque . 
Of concern , since 2008 attacks in [LOC Pakistan  ] have repeatedly targeted [MISC Westerners  ] , coinciding with an unprecedented number of attacks in both [LOC Lahore  ] and [LOC Islamabad  ] .

( U ) EUR CTAD comment: The latest version of the [ORG National Security Strategy  ] released by the [ORG UK Government  ] includes a public cyber security strategy . 
The report calls for the establishment of two new offices with cyber security responsibilities and approves the use of offensive operations as a countermeasure to attacks against [MISC British  ] systems . 
The [ORG Office of Cyber Security  ] , falling under the [ORG Cabinet Office  ] , will be the central body charged with coordinating with industry and developing strategy . 
The [ORG Cyber Security Operations Centre  ] based at [ORG Government Communications Headquarters  ] , the [LOC UK  ] 's primary signals intelligence agency , will be responsible for conducting offensive operations . 
According to press reports , the [ORG UK Government  ] has hired several former hackers to staff the centre. <a id='par46' href='#par46'>¶</a>46 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [ORG NEA  ] CTAD comment: DoD reporting indicates as of mid-May , several [MISC Persian-language  ] hacker forums are sharing information pertaining to a variety of hacking codes , tools , and video tutorials . 
One of the more notable findings was a [MISC PHP-based  ] " simattacker code " -- a backdoor [MISC Trojan  ] horse program that allows for remote exploitation of an affected system and can provide denial-of-service capabilities . 
This particular malicious code is reportedly similar to a tool used against [MISC Georgian  ] systems in 2008 ( NFI ) . <a id='par47' href='#par47'>¶</a>47 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) EAP CTAD comment: According to [MISC South Korean  ] press reporting , the [LOC Republic of Korea  ] 's ( [ORG RoK  ] 's ) [ORG Defense Security Command  ] ( [ORG DSC  ] ) has declared intrusion attempts against the [ORG RoK  ] 's military computer networks have increased 20 percent in 2009 , compared to those detected in 2008 . 
The [ORG DSC  ] further stated that 89 percent of the attempts are unsophisticated efforts to hack into servers and [MISC Internet  ] homepages , whereas the remaining 11 percent appear to be more advanced attempts to obtain intelligence information . 
Of note , in an effort to deal with the increasing cyber threat , the [ORG RoK  ] 's [ORG National Intelligence Service  ] has recommended President [PER Lee Myung-bak  ] appoint an aide to assist with the country 's cyber security issues. <a id='par48' href='#par48'>¶</a>48 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [ORG SCA  ] CTAD comment: According to [ORG Defense Intelligence Agency  ] reporting , the Government of [LOC India  ] ( [MISC GoI  ] ) continues efforts to advance its computer security programs -- particularly in light of increased concerns over [MISC Chinese  ] computer network exploitation efforts -- but progress is hampered by significant disagreements within its departments . 
The key [MISC GoI  ] organizations involved in developing and implementing security policies are identified as the [ORG Ministry of Telecommunications  ] and the [ORG Research and Analysis Wing  ] . 
Although the [MISC Indian  ] [ORG Army  ] is primarily responsible for the security of military networks , [MISC Indian  ] officials acknowledge [ORG Army  ] representatives have been largely left out of discussions . 
Additionally , some other key groups , such as the [ORG National Technical Reconnaissance Organization  ] and the [MISC Indian  ] [ORG Defense Intelligence Agency  ] , have reportedly failed to offer significant contributions . 
Private security companies are also concerned that the lack of input from the private sector may lead to unfair regulations regarding telecommunications monitoring. <a id='par49' href='#par49'>¶</a>49 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Domestic CTAD comment: On June 22 , [ORG Websense Security Labs  ] issued an alert after discovering the official website of the Embassy of [LOC Ethiopia  ] in [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC DC  ] , had been subverted with obfuscated [ORG JavaScript  ] code hidden in an inline frame ( [ORG IFrame  ] ) with the goal of infecting visitors to the site with malicious software ( malware ) . 
The code redirected users to sites where malware , including [MISC Trojan  ] downloaders , were installed without explicit user action . 
According to the alert , the site that hosted the malicious [ORG JavaScript  ] is currently down . 
On March 20 , security company [ORG Sophos  ] discovered a similar [ORG IFrame  ] infection on the same website . 
At the time , researchers at [ORG Sophos  ] noted it resembled the attack on the [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC DC  ] , Embassy of [LOC Azerbaijan  ] website that occurred in early March . 
The researchers also indicated the redirected sites had been used by [MISC Russian  ] cyber criminals in previous malware infections .

[ORG Beijing TOPSEC Network Security Technology Company  ] , Ltd . 
[ORG TOPSEC  ] is a [ORG China Information Technology Security Center  ] ( [ORG CNITSEC  ] ) enterprise and has grown to become [LOC China  ] 's largest provider of information security products and services . 
[ORG TOPSEC  ] is credited with launching [LOC China  ] 's first indigenous firewall in 1996 , as well as other information technology ( IT ) security products to [LOC China  ] 's market , to include virtual private networks , intrusion detection systems , filtering gateways , and security auditing and management systems . 
Additionally , in September 2000 , [PER Weidong  ] founded the company [LOC Tianweichengxin  ] , a.k.a. iTrusChina , which became the first experimental enterprise to develop business Public Key [ORG Infrastructure/Certification Authority  ] services approved by [LOC China  ] 's [ORG Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.  ] <a id='par54' href='#par54'>¶</a>54 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) CTAD comment: During an interview with [ORG China News Network  ] , [PER Weidong  ] stated that half of [ORG TOPSEC  ] 's start-up capital came from the [LOC PRC  ] , with the other half coming from the company 's management department . 
Additionally , he pointed out that [ORG TOPSEC  ] began not as a company , but as a small research institute that took contracts from the government 's research and development tasks ( NFI ) . 
The turning point for [ORG TOPSEC  ] came in 1996 when the company won a significant contract bid from the [MISC Chinese  ] [ORG State Statistics Bureau  ] . 
Since winning the bid , [ORG TOPSEC  ] maintained a 100-percent sales growth in the following years . 
[PER Weidong  ] noted the company started out with 30,000 [ORG RMB  ] ( approximately $4,400 ) in 1995 , and by 2002 , had earnings of 3 billion [ORG RMB  ] ( approximately $440,000,000 ) .

[PER Weidong  ] also stated a bank loan was never used. <a id='par55' href='#par55'>¶</a>55 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) CTAD comment: Of note , the [ORG CNITSEC  ] is responsible for overseeing the [LOC PRC  ] 's [ORG Information Technology  ] ( IT ) security certification program . 
It operates and maintains the [ORG National Evaluation and Certification Scheme  ] for IT security and performs tests for information security products . 
In 2003 , the [ORG CNITSEC  ] signed a Government Security Program ( [ORG GSP  ] ) international agreement with [ORG Microsoft  ] that allowed select companies such as [ORG TOPSEC  ] access to [ORG Microsoft  ] source code in order to secure the Windows platform .

[PER Venus Tech  ] , another [ORG CNITSEC  ] enterprise privy to the [ORG GSP  ] , is also known to affiliate with [MISC XFocus  ] , one of the few [MISC Chinese  ] hacker groups known to develop exploits to new vulnerabilities in a short period of time , as evidenced in the 2003 release of [PER Blaster Worm  ] ( See CTAD Daily [PER Read File  ] ( [ORG DRF  ] ) April 4 , 2008 ) . <a id='par57' href='#par57'>¶</a>57 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) CTAD comment: While links between top [MISC Chinese  ] companies and the [LOC PRC  ] are not uncommon , it illustrates the [LOC PRC  ] 's use of its " private sector " in support of governmental information warfare objectives , especially in its ability to gather , process , and exploit information . 
As evidenced with [ORG TOPSEC  ] , there is a strong possibility the [LOC PRC  ] is harvesting the talents of its private sector in order to bolster offensive and defensive computer network operations capabilities .
