CONAKRY 00166 Classified By: ARSO [PER Elizabeth Esparza  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) SUMMARY: On April 11 , 2008 , [MISC Guinean  ] police seized a shipment of cocaine , exact quantity unknown , and detained six suspects believed to be of [MISC Latin American  ] origin ( Reftel A , B ) . 
All USG requests for additional information regarding the details of the seizure or the suspects have gone unanswered ( Reftel C ) . 
The mission focused its efforts to ensure the destruction of the drugs and the result of these efforts proves that corrupt elements of the government are in full control . 
Exactly one month after the seizure , Ambassador and ARSO attended the alleged incineration of 390 kilos of cocaine . 
The incineration was a farce that fooled no one and highlighted the possible complicity of the [MISC Guinean  ] Minister of [LOC Interior  ] and Security and high-level police officials . 
END SUMMARY. ------------------------ A LONG-ANTICIPATED EVENT ------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) Over a ten-day period , the Mission in collaboration with the [MISC British  ] Ambassador made several unsuccessful attempts to discuss the transparent destruction of the drugs . 
Finally , on May 2 , 2008 , the [LOC US  ] and [LOC UK  ] Ambassadors met with the Minister of [LOC Interior  ] and Security and were given well-rehearsed assurances of the [ORG GOG  ] , s commitment to combating drug trafficking and an invitation to view the drugs , destruction ( Reftel D ) . 
The incineration initially planned for May 7 and rescheduled for May 9 , finally took place on May 10 , 2008. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) [ORG GOG  ] officials in attendance included Director of [ORG OCAD Thermite Mara  ] , Deputy Director of [ORG OCAD  ] [PER Zakaria Cisse  ] , Police Director General [PER Sekou Bangoura  ] , Police Controller General [PER Madifing Diane  ] , President of the [ORG National Committee Against Drug Trafficking  ] ( [ORG CNLD  ] ) Gare , Deputy General Secretary of [ORG CNLD  ] [PER Aguibou Tall  ] , and approximately three dozen [ORG OCAD  ] agents . 
The Minister of Justice and the Minister of [LOC Interior  ] and Security were also present. ------------------------- EXCUSES , EXCUSES , EXCUSES ------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) After consultations with DEA [LOC Paris  ] , Ambassador requested permission to take a random sample of the cocaine for testing purposes . 
Controller General [PER Diane  ] automatically agreed , causing an immediate backlash from Director General [PER Bangoura  ] and [ORG OCAD  ] Director [PER Mara  ] . 
Director General [PER Bangoura  ] found several excuses , to include concern over Ambassador and ARSO , s health and safety . 
He also explained that the cocaine had been treated with chemicals , rendering it useless . 
Director General [PER Bangoura  ] , in his usual arrogant and condescending fashion , refused to address the Ambassador , claiming that this was not a matter of diplomacy , but police business . 
[ORG OCAD Director Mara  ] , s enraged response included direct accusations of infringement upon [MISC Guinean  ] sovereignty . 
This heated exchange took place in a very public setting and was documented by the private press. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) Controller General [PER Diane  ] reports directly to Minister of [LOC Interior  ] and Security [PER Keita  ] . 
[ORG OCAD Director Mara  ] reports to Director General [PER Bangoura  ] , who reports to Controller General [PER Diane  ] . 
The interaction between these officials demostrates an obvious disregard for rank and seniority , which is especially concerning given that respect for hierarchy is usually the norm in [MISC Guinean  ] culture . 
This begs the questions , " who 's in charge ? 
" . --------------------- THEATRICAL PRODUCTION --------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) Upon the arrival of Minister of [LOC Interior  ] and Security [PER Keita  ] and Minister of Justice [PER Paulette Kourouma  ] , the Ambassador , s request for a random sample of the cocaine was quickly denied . 
The pile was immediately doused with gasoline and ceremoniously lit on fire by the Minister of Justice . 
The President of the [ORG National Committee Against Drug Trafficking  ] was very dramatic in announcing the destruction of 160 kilos of marijuana , 390 kilos of cocaine and 43 boxes of pharmaceutical products ( later explained to be expired ibuprofen ) . 
The destroyed narcotics were reportedly valued at 6.5 million dollars. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) After the incineration , ARSO was permitted to take a sample from a pre-designated package of cocaine . 
The [ORG OCAD  ] Deputy Director , the only individual that was allowed to get near the pile of narcotics , handpicked the package . 
On May 6 , 2008 , [ORG RSO  ] FSN Investigator received a call from [LOC XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , who in the past weeks has provided [ORG RSO  ] with sensitive information on the drug seizure ( Reftel B ) . 
[LOC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated that the [ORG GoG  ] planned to burn packages of flour . 
ARSO is unable to prove that the cocaine was in fact substituted with flour ; however , the [ORG GoG  ] , s lack of cooperation and vehement rejection to a request for random sampling raises troubling questions about the [ORG GoG  ] 's interest in transparency . 
And as the Ambassador , s driver very keenly observed , " I know the smell of burning marijuana , and I didn , t smell anything . 
" The entire event was a theatrical production. ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) The event was a real eye-opener and a facade . 
The incineration was a ridiculous attempt by the [ORG GoG  ] to prove that a law enforcement campaign against narcotics exists . 
If anything was proven , it was that the traffickers' influence has reached the highest levels of the government . 
There is an obvious fracture within the security forces , and only a handful of officials appear to be fighting to carry out legitimate duties . 
The clear reluctance and open animosity displayed by all the senior [ORG Ministry of Interior and Security  ] ( [ORG MIS  ] ) officials and the diffident response of the Ministers to the Ambassador 's request suggest complicity at the highest levels of the Ministry . 
The silver-lining of the event is that the heated debate and ridiculous protestation by [ORG MIS  ] to the Ambassador 's request for a random sampling were witnessed and recorded by elements of the [MISC Guinean  ] media ( state-owned and independent ) .
