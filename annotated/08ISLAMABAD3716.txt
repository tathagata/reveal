<code><pre>S E C R E T ISLAMABAD 003716 EO 12958 DECL: 11/28/2018 TAGS PREL , PGOV , PTER , IN , [LOC UK  ] , PK SUBJECT: [LOC PAKISTAN  ] REACTIONS TO TERROR IN [MISC MUMBAI Classified  ] By: [PER Gerald Feierstein  ] , [ORG CDA  ] , for reasons 1.4 ( b , d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Summary . 
President [PER Zardari  ] , PM [PER Gilani  ] and [PER FM Qureshi  ] have made all the right public statements condemning the November 27-28 militant attacks in [LOC Mumbai  ] ; [PER Gilani  ] has agreed to an [MISC Indian  ] request and is sending ISI Chief MG Pasha to [LOC India  ] to participate in the investigation . 
Interior Minister [PER Malik  ] told Charge that [PER Zardari  ] is meeting with appropriate cabinet members November 28 to discuss further possible [MISC GOP  ] reaction , and [ORG NSA Durrani  ] forwarded via Charge a message to [ORG NSA  ] Hadley focusing on the need to jointly fight militants that threaten both [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC India  ] . 
The [LOC UK  ] Embassy in [LOC Islamabad  ] advises they have reporting that confirms involvement of [LOC Lashkar-e-Taiba  ] , which reportedly plans additional attacks in [LOC India  ] . 
The [ORG UK High Commission  ] is suggesting to [LOC London  ] that they press the [MISC GOP  ] for quick , credible action in the form of arrests of [MISC LeT  ] leaders to prevent a feared [MISC Indian  ] backlash . 
The [LOC UK  ] believes that [LOC New Delhi  ] will be pressed politically to respond , at a minimum with increased proxy action in [LOC Balochistan  ] , and at a maximum with attacks on [MISC LeT  ] training camps in [LOC Kashmir  ] . 
The [LOC UK  ] is seeking to coordinate its message with the [LOC U.S.  ] and notes that [PER FM Miliband  ] will see the Secretary on December 1. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Post notes there is as yet no direct evidence of [MISC GOP  ] involvement in the attack , although the press is reporting that [LOC India  ] has captured at least one militant of [MISC Pakistani  ] origin . 
We believe the [LOC UK  ] here is overreacting but agree a coordinated message urging concrete [MISC GOP  ] action against [MISC LeT  ] would be welcome . 
If the militant plan was to ensure that the [LOC Pakistan  ] Army would not shift troops from the eastern border to the tribal areas , the horrific [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks may have succeeded . 
End Summary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) President [PER Asif Zardari  ] and PM [PER Gilani  ] both condemned the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks on November 27 . 
[PER Zardari  ] called [ORG Congress  ] leader [PER Sonia Ghandi  ] and termed the killing of innocent people a “detestable act” and asked her to convey his grief and sorrow to the people of [LOC India  ] and to the families of those who had lost their loved ones . 
[PER Gilani  ] called PM [PER Manmohan Singh  ] and said “I and the people of [LOC Pakistan  ] want to share the pain of the people of [LOC India  ] and its government” and called for concerted efforts to make the region a peaceful place . 
[PER FM Qureshi  ] , who was in [LOC India  ] to inaugurate the fifth round of the [ORG Indo-Pak Composite Dialogue  ] , noted that he had offered to set up hot lines between the two intelligence chiefs to strengthen their joint anti-terror mechanism . 
He warned , however , against jumping to conclusions and pointing fingers regarding responsibility. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG Pakistan’s National Security Advisor  ] [PER Mahmud Durrani  ] called Charge November 28 and asked that the following points be passed to [LOC Washington:  ] -- [LOC Pakistan  ] is extremely sorry about the events that have transpired in [LOC Mumbai  ] ; -- This is a threat that both [LOC India  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] are facing together and they need to fight it together ; -- President [PER Zardari  ] spoke to [PER Manmohan Singh  ] this morning ( he spoke to [PER Sonia Gandhi  ] yesterday ) ’ -- Prime Minister [PER Gilani  ] also spoke to the [MISC Indian  ] PM ; -- The [MISC Indians  ] have asked the [MISC GOP  ] to send ISI officers to [LOC India  ] to participate in the investigation ; the [MISC GOP  ] has agreed ; -- [LOC India  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] need to avoid being dragged into the militant’s agenda. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Charge spoke with Interior Minister [PER Rehman Malik  ] , who reported that [PER Zardari  ] was convening a meeting November 28 to discuss the [MISC Pakistani  ] reaction to the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks ; [PER Malik  ] promised a readout of the meeting. the [MISC Pakistani  ] press carried FM Mukherjee’s November 28 press conference in which he followed up on PM Singh’s comments about a “foreign” hand to say there was prima facie evidence of involvement by [MISC Pakistanis  ] in the attacks . 
Later the press reported that the [ORG GOA  ] has one attacker of [MISC Pakistani  ] origin in custody . 
The press also confirmed that [PER Gilani  ] accepted the [MISC Indian  ] request to participate in the investigation and is sending ISI Chief MG Pasha to [LOC India  ] ( date still uncertain ) to lead the [MISC Pakistani  ] delegation. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG British High Commission  ] officials in [LOC Islamabad  ] told Polcouns November 28 that HMG has evidence the attacks in [LOC Mumbai  ] were carried out by [LOC Lashkar-e-Taiba  ] ( [MISC LeT  ] ) , which was planning more attacks . 
The [LOC UK  ] officials noted that after the attack on the [MISC Indian  ] Embassy in [LOC Kabul  ] , the [ORG GOI  ] halted the [ORG Composite Dialogue  ] , but this time speculated they will feel the need to respond with force rather than diplomacy . 
They fear a response could include , at a minimum , increase [ORG GOI  ] covert activities in [LOC Balochistan  ] or even an aerial bombardment of [MISC LeT  ] camps in [LOC Azad  ] , [LOC Jammu  ] and [LOC Kashmir  ] ( [LOC AJK  ] ) . 
The [LOC UK  ] mission here is proposing that Foreign Secretary [PER Miliband  ] call [PER Zardari  ] and [PER Qureshi  ] and their Chief of Defence Staff call [PER Kayani  ] with the message that [LOC Pakistan  ] must act now to take proactive steps to “rescue” the [ORG Indo-Pak  ] relationship , suggesting that [LOC Islamabad  ] should act before [LOC New Delhi  ] demands more . 
The [LOC UK  ] mission is suggesting to [LOC London  ] that the [LOC UK  ] call for credible actions , perhaps to include arresting senior [MISC LeT  ] leaders and “permanently closing down the infrastructure of the militancy.” The [LOC UK  ] is seeking to coordinate its message closely with the [LOC U.S.  ] and notes that [PER Miliband  ] is due to see the Secretary on December 1. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Polcouns noted that , as yet , there was no evidence linking a presumed [MISC LeT  ] attack to ISI or the [MISC GOP  ] . 
The [LOC UK  ] Polcouns agreed they had no smoking gun but , nevertheless , believed that the pressure on [LOC India  ] to react strongly would be impossible politically to avoid . 
He admitted that [LOC UK  ] concern was being driven in part by the presence of up to half a million [LOC UK  ] citizens living in [LOC AJK.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) [MISC Pakistani  ] media reacted predictably with denials of [MISC Pakistani  ] involvement and demands for proof before accusations were made . 
[PER Dawn TV  ] , echoing the print media , highlighted statements issued by the President and the Prime Minister that “both countries are victims and must join together to combat a common enemy , ” and that “the two countries must not fall into the trap of the militants.” [PER Zardari  ] is reported to have told [PER Singh  ] that he recognized he was the first to call him after the [MISC Marriott  ] hotel attack in [LOC Islamabad  ] . 
[PER Dawn  ] reports officials saying “the blame game must not begin , ” but its own commentators say the blame game is underway . 
Local print media November 28 mostly reported the event in straight stories with editorials condemning both the attacks and [MISC Indian  ] accusations . 
Some speculated the attacks were meant to undermine Zardari’s outreach to [LOC India  ] and juxtaposed the attacks against modest progress in the [ORG Composite Dialogue  ] meetings on counter terrorism issues. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Comment: For now , we believe the [LOC UK  ] Embassy here is overreacting but agree it would be helpful if the [MISC GOP  ] could get out ahead of the [LOC New Delhi  ] reaction and take proactive measures against [MISC LeT  ] leaders. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) If the militant’s plan was to force the [MISC Pakistani  ] Army to re-focus on its eastern border and eliminate any chance ( however slight ) of moving forces from the [MISC Indian  ] border to the [LOC Federally Administered Tribal Areas  ] ( [LOC FATA  ] ) , then their plan may have succeeded . 
The [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks likely torpedoed any prospect of [MISC Indian  ] [ORG CBMs  ] on [LOC Kashmir  ] in the immediate future . 
The decision to send ISI MG Pasha to [LOC India  ] , however , is a good sign that both sides are trying to prevent these horrific attacks from undermine all the progress made on bilateral rapprochement .
