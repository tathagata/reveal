END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) In a December 10 meeting , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , said the December 7 Merkel-Sarkozy meetings in [LOC Paris  ] were very productive even though [PER Merkel  ] and [MISC Sarkozy’s  ] personalities are like “fire and water.”XXXXXXXXXXXXsaid tension is felt throughout the room when the two are together , then added that just being in a room with [PER Sarkozy  ] is enough to make anyone’s stress levels increase . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that [ORG Chirac  ] and [PER Schroeder  ] also did not connect personally , but still had a constructive partnership . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] remarked that [PER Sarkozy  ] has the unique tendency to disconnect policy areas in a way that normal , interagency coordination would never permit , and that [PER Sarkozy  ] often seems to dismiss the responsible bureaucracies from the policy-making process . 
The ensuing , less-than-holistic results can provoke dissent in the government ( for example , regarding [MISC Libyan  ] leader [ORG Qadhafi’s  ] current visit to [LOC France  ] ) . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , fatigue is also a byproduct of the chaos that goes with [MISC Sarkozy’s  ] hyper-activism on every front . 
Apprehension about imminent changes in the ministerial line-up adds to the tension . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said many expected a reshuffling of the cabinet in January , adding that [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] sensed ministers and their staffers are “afraid to go on vacation because something might happen to their jobs while they are away.” <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] described Germany’s views of the [MISC French  ] [ORG Mediterranean Union  ] initiative as “cautious.” [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the [MISC French  ] government , and the press , have characterized [LOC Germany  ] as supportive of the initiative following the December 7 meeting . 
However , a close read of [LOC Chancellor Merkel’s  ] “very diplomatic” statements following the meeting indicates no shift from the cautious views [LOC Germany  ] had previously espoused . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] added that [MISC French  ] Ambassador [PER Alain Le Roy  ] , charged with shepherding the initiative , had recent consultations in [LOC Germany  ] that provoked “very negative” reactions . 
[LOC Germany  ] does agree that the issues the [ORG Mediterranean Union  ] is intended to address are very important , but continues to prefer the [MISC Euromed  ] dialogue established through the [ORG Barcelona Process  ] , in part because funding for the [ORG Mediterranean Union  ] initiative would be difficult to assure . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that some [MISC Germans  ] view [LOC France  ] , s [ORG Med Union  ] proposal as “parochial , ” since [LOC Germany  ] , s own backyard is not the [MISC Mediterranean  ] but [ORG Eastern Europe.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said President [PER Sarkozy  ] seems to have come around to previous leaders’ conclusions that [MISC French-German  ] cooperation is the “engine” of the [ORG EU  ] . 
[MISC French-German  ] exchanges are intensifying in preparation for the [MISC French  ] [ORG EU  ] Presidency in the second half of 2008 . 
Just as the November 12 joint Council of Ministers meeting focused on one of [MISC France’s  ] Presidency priorities , immigration and integration , the next intergovernmental meeting will focus on the [MISC French  ] Presidency priority of energy and environment . 
[LOC France  ] and [LOC Germany  ] are also working closely on the third [MISC French  ] priority , [ORG ESDP  ] , with frequent contacts at the Political Director level and between planning staffs . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] characterized [LOC France  ] as seeking to translate high-level , theoretical consensus on [ORG ESDP  ] goals into concrete projects such as the planned [ORG ESDP  ] mission to [LOC Chad.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Also on Dec. 10 , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , echoed [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] in describing close [MISC French-German  ] cooperation leading up to the [MISC French  ] [ORG EU  ] Presidency . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] added that the next in the series of regular “Blaesheim” meetings involving [MISC French  ] and [MISC German  ] heads of government and foreign ministers will focus on both bilateral and [MISC European  ] questions of security and defense.XXXXXXXXXXXX noted that [LOC Germany  ] participated in the [MISC French  ] planning seminar for the [ORG EU  ] Presidency in November , drawing on its recent experience with the [ORG EU  ] Presidency ( Jan.-June 2007 ) . 
On other points , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said word in the [MISC German  ] Embassy was that the atmospherics of the Merkel-Sarkozy meeting were positive and that the [MISC French  ] clarification that all [ORG EU  ] member-states could participate in the [ORG Mediterranean Union  ] initiative was well-received .
