[PER Carol van Voorst  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C/NF ) [MISC Icelandic  ] Foreign Minister [PER Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir  ] 's visit to [LOC Washington  ] April 10-12 will be her first visit with a bilateral agenda . 
Since her [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] party came into government last June , she has quickly forged a solid relationship with her center-right coalition partner Prime Minister [PER Haarde  ] ( whom you met in [LOC Washington  ] in 2006 ) and has assumed full control over the foreign affairs and defense brief . 
She initially underestimated the demands of the job ; [PER Gisladottir  ] came in with expectations of being able to take lengthy vacations in the [MISC Nordic  ] tradition and dividing her time equally between statecraft and domestic party leadership . 
The latter task has been roughly shoved aside in the last six months as the [ORG FM  ] has been constantly on the road , largely in support of [LOC Iceland  ] 's [ORG UN Security Council  ] bid . 
Mastering the defense and security issues in her portfolio ( [LOC Iceland  ] has neither a military nor a separate [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] ) has also been a challenge , though one that [PER Gisladottir  ] has tackled well . 
Still an activist , learning statesmanship ----------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) In person , [PER Gisladottir  ] 's habitual body language is closed and stern ; she often spends the first part of a meeting with arms crossed and her jaw tight . 
This does not necessarily mean she disagrees , but warmth takes a while to percolate through and her interlocutors may not learn that their message was taken on board until later . 
Our experience over the last year is that she has firm views , but listens closely and is willing to change her mind. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Gisladottir  ] is a shrewd politician with an activist streak , in the [MISC Nordic  ] social democratic mold . 
She keeps in close touch with [MISC Norwegian  ] [ORG FM Store  ] . 
On foreign policy issues , she tends to bend to public opinion rather than set the tone herself . 
As a socialist in a party with a strong pacifist wing , [PER Gisladottir  ] is uncomfortable with the appearance or use of force and struggles with the need to blend [MISC Icelandic  ] civilian expertise into military ( i.e. , [ORG NATO  ] ) peacekeeping operations . 
She has forcefully expressed her anger over the issue of alleged [ORG CIA  ] rendition flights through [LOC Iceland  ] . 
At the same time , her skill in asserting her independence in foreign policy means that under her watch , [LOC Iceland  ] passed its first-ever defense budget and is reforming its defense sector with barely a whisper of controversy . 
Formerly taboo subjects like the establishment of an intelligence analysis unit have been folded into this move with nothing resembling the hue and cry surrounding the previous coalition government 's attempt to do so . 
Her credibility on the renditions issue meant she was able to immediately squash a recent opposition call for a parliamentary inquiry . 
Meeting topics -------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [MISC NATO/Afghanistan: On  ] [LOC Afghanistan  ] , the [ORG FM  ] will be eager to share her impressions from her March 15-17 trip to [LOC Kabul  ] and [LOC Meymaneh  ] . 
[LOC Iceland  ] has 14 civilian peacekeepers deployed with [ORG NATO  ] and is developing a three-year plan for future involvement . 
We strongly encouraged this first [MISC Icelandic  ] cabinet-level trip to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , which has pumped sorely needed information into the contentious debate here about why [LOC Iceland  ] should care about [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Gisladottir  ] is interested in [LOC USG  ] views on how [LOC Iceland  ] can best contribute , but [ORG Ministry sources  ] tell us that the emphasis is firmly planted in civilian tasks that look much like traditional development aid . 
We were disappointed last April when [PER Gisladottir  ] 's predecessor pulled [LOC Iceland  ] 's mobile liaison team out of [LOC PRT Chaghcharan  ] , and have lobbied her without success to renew that contribution . 
We should push the Icelanders to greatly step up their support for police training , which may also allow them to blend in elements relating to the status of women ( a heartfelt personal concern of [PER Gisladottir  ] 's ) . <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [LOC High North:  ] In [LOC Bucharest  ] , [PER Gisladottir  ] and PM [PER Haarde  ] will announce [LOC Iceland  ] 's sponsorship of a [ORG NATO  ] conference on security in the [LOC High North  ] in January 2009 . 
[LOC Iceland  ] has in ever-stronger terms called for increased [ORG Alliance  ] focus on its [MISC North Atlantic  ] neighborhood . 
Pointing to the implications of the melting [MISC Arctic  ] ice for maritime security and resources exploitation , [PER Gisladottir  ] will probably mention [LOC Iceland  ] 's acute awareness of a more assertive and visible [LOC Russia  ] in the [MISC North Atlantic  ] . 
[LOC U.S.  ] exercises and ship visits have helped to ease these concerns , and [ORG NATO  ] 's new air policing mission here beginning this April ( with the [MISC French  ] in one of their first [ORG NATO  ] common defense tasks since [PER de Gaulle  ] ; a [LOC U.S.  ] rotation is slated for August 2008 ) has been warmly welcomed . 
[PER Gisladottir  ] and her government now feel it is time that [ORG NATO  ] think seriously about conventional security concerns in this part of the world , building on previous discussions about climate change and shipping security. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( SBU ) Women and [PER Peace: Gisladottir  ] founded [LOC Iceland  ] 's Women 's List political party in the 1980s , and though that particular feminist group has been subsumed in her [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] party , the [ORG FM  ] still places immense importance on gender issues . 
Her ministry just produced [LOC Iceland  ] 's action plan for implementing [ORG UNSCR  ] 1325 on the role of women in peacebuilding and security , and [PER Gisladottir  ] will want to raise this as an entree to the topic of the [ORG International Women 's Commission  ] for a Just and [ORG Sustainable Palestinian-Israeli Peace  ] . 
[PER Gisladottir  ] believes passionately that women have a special contribution to make to sustainable peace , and reportedly was appalled by the conditions endured by women in [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) [ORG UN Security Council Campaign: Though  ] unlikely to press hard on [LOC Iceland  ] 's [ORG UNSC  ] bid , [PER Gisladottir  ] will undoubtedly remind us that [LOC Iceland  ] would appreciate [LOC U.S.  ] support for a seat in 2009-10 . 
The [ORG UNSC  ] campaign is coloring in ever-stronger hues the conduct of [LOC Iceland  ] 's foreign policy ; [PER Gisladottir  ] has made two trips to [ORG African Union  ] meetings in the last year and just returned from a [LOC Caribbean  ] visit , both regions not routinely toured by her predecessors . 
More significantly , there are signs that [LOC Iceland  ] delayed its recognition of [LOC Kosovo  ] last month to try to avoid antagonizing [LOC Russia  ] . 
[PER Gisladottir  ] has taken harsh criticism within her own party for her initially weak statements on the situation in [LOC Tibet  ] , which many saw as a sop to the [MISC Chinese  ] . 
Similarly , the [ORG MFA  ] concedes that a campaign trip to [LOC Iran  ] last month by [PER Gisladottir  ] 's deputy was an embarrassing mistake . 
The learning curve for both the Minister and her [ORG MFA  ] has been steep , and [LOC Iceland  ] is getting a thorough introduction to the rough-and-tumble world they will be entering should they win a seat this fall. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Other issues: Whaling continues to be an irritant as there are rumblings that [LOC Iceland  ] may allow commercial whaling again this year . 
We should take the opportunity to point out that this step would not win them many votes in the [ORG Security Council  ] race . 
[LOC Iceland  ] 's economy is showing some cracks in the " northern miracle " facade , as tightening world credit markets put the squeeze on the country 's highly leveraged banking sector . 
In more positive news , [PER Gisladottir  ] may note our flourishing bilateral cooperation on clean energy , though she mostly leaves this field to others such as President [PER Grimsson  ] and the Minister of [LOC Industry.  ] van [LOC Voorst  ] / / / / / / / /</pre></code>
