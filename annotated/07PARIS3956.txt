( A ) [LOC PARIS  ] POINTS 20 SEPTEMBER 2007 <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
( B ) [LOC PARIS  ] 3668 Classified [ORG By: Acting Political Minister-Counselor  ] [PER Andrew Young  ] for rea sons 1.4 . 
( b ) , ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) During a September 19 call on [MISC French  ] MFA DAS-equivalent for the [ORG Levant  ] [PER Ludovic Pouille  ] , we asked whether he had heard anything that might indicate FM [PER Kouchner  ] or any other [MISC French  ] officials planned to meet with [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Ahmadi Nejad  ] in [LOC New York  ] . 
[PER Pouille  ] shook his head no on [PER Ahmadi Nejad  ] , but he stated that [PER Kouchner  ] is scheduled to meet with his [MISC Iranian  ] counterpart on the margins of the [LOC UNGA.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Although [PER Pouille  ] does not cover [LOC Iran  ] , he stated that posts throughout the [ORG NEA  ] region had reported queries from host governments about [LOC France  ] , s policy in light of FM [PER Kouchner  ] , s recent remarks about the possibility the confrontation over [LOC Iran  ] , s nuclear program could lead to war . 
This had necessitated the drafting of &talking points8 to be sent out worldwide to refocus attention on what [PER Kouchner  ] said about the need to pursue diplomacy to the maximum extent possible . 
[PER Pouille  ] ( strictly protect ) opined that [PER Kouchner  ] had not for the first time allowed his tongue to get ahead of his brain in terms of his public utterances . 
He has struggled since to get the emphasis back on diplomatic efforts to resolve the nuclear issue and to minimize the importance of his reference to the possibility of war. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) We spoke September 20 to [MISC French  ] MFA [LOC Iran  ] desk officer [PER Arnaud Pescheux  ] , who confirmed his understanding that [PER Kouchner  ] was currently the most senior [MISC French  ] official expected to meet with the [MISC Iranians  ] in [LOC New York  ] , and then only the foreign minister . 
He related that the [MISC Iranian  ] mission in [LOC New York  ] had passed a formal written request to the [MISC French  ] mission for an [PER Ahmadi Nejad/Sarkozy  ] meeting . 
The [ORG GOF  ] had ignored the request in the same manner it ignored [PER Ahmadi Nejad  ] , s congratulatory message to [PER Sarkozy  ] after his election as president . 
Nonetheless , and as [PER Kouchner  ] has publicly stated , [PER Pescheux  ] underscored that [LOC France  ] continues to have a normal relationship with [LOC Iran  ] across the board , covering a host of bilateral and regional issues ( notably [LOC Lebanon  ] ) . 
This includes frequent visits to [LOC Paris  ] by [MISC Iranian  ] officials . 
Tension over the nuclear issue has not changed this , even though it has obviously complicated the bilateral dialogue somewhat . 
In this respect , [PER Pescheux  ] stated that the [MISC French  ] embassy in [LOC Tehran  ] has received numerous complaints about recent public [MISC French  ] statements despite the fact that few of them have been replayed fully via the [MISC Iranian  ] media to the public at large . 
( Comment: This echoes what MFA DAS-equivalent for [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] , and the [PER Gulf Franck Gellet  ] and others have told us per ref b . 
End comment ) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) With respect to the new channel [PER Velayati  ] has tried to open via [PER Gellet  ] and Presidency strategic affairs adviser [PER Francois Richier  ] ( also ref b ) , [PER Pescheux  ] said that it was not closed off , just inactive until such time as [LOC France  ] might decide to make use of it . 
He repeated that the [ORG GOF  ] is fully aware that [LOC Tehran  ] is trying to divide the [ORG P-5  ] 1 by opening such a channel . 
As for the idea , bruited by [PER Pouille  ] , that [MISC French  ] special envoy for [LOC Lebanon  ] [PER Jean-Claude Cousseran  ] might travel to [LOC Tehran  ] with a larger mandate than the situation in [LOC Lebanon  ] , [PER Pescheux  ] said that was under discussion . 
Nothing had been decided , either in terms of dispatching [MISC Cousseran  ] on such a mission or possible timing , although it was unlikely to happen prior to the end of the ministerial portion of the current [LOC UNGA  ] . 
[PER Pescheux  ] reiterated the often expressed view at the [LOC Quai  ] that , unlike [LOC Syria  ] , [LOC Iran  ] is not presently inclined to stir things up in [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
He explained that for [LOC Iran  ] , the consequences of a renewed civil war that could inter alia pit Sunnis against [MISC Shi  ] , a would set [MISC Iranian  ] efforts to expand its regional influence back. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Comment: As ref a demonstrates , [PER Kouchner  ] is not only trying to recast his earlier remarks in a way that downplays references to the possibility of war with [LOC Iran  ] but to underscore his readiness to engage with [LOC Iran  ] including via a trip to [LOC Tehran  ] . 
We are not aware of any plans for [PER Kouchner  ] to travel there , however , and he was very careful when he responded to a reporter , s question on this that he kept it limited to whether in principle he was prepared to go . 
Despite the rhetoric and the furor surrounding [PER Kouchner  ] , s remarks , the [MISC French  ] have not closed any doors to continued engagement . 
We think it unlikely , given the charged atmosphere and the [MISC French  ] determination to keep [PER Ahmadi Nejad  ] at arms length , that President [PER Sarkozy  ] will meet formally with him on the margins of [LOC UNGA  ] , although we would not rule out the possibility of an impromptu pull-aside should the two find themselves at a group event organized by the [ORG UN  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] was unwavering in a national television interview [LOC PARIS  ] 00003956 002 OF 002 September 21 that [LOC Iran  ] must not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons .
