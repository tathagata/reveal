( S ) Summary: [ORG HFAC  ] staffers [PER Richard Kessler  ] and [PER David Fite  ] received from [ORG IAEA Secretariat  ] November 10 information on the [LOC Iran  ] case that tracked with the tone of the subsequent Director General’s reporting on [LOC Iran  ] to the [ORG Board of Governors  ] . 
The [ORG STAFFDEL  ] heard that contact with [LOC Iran  ] over “possible military dimensions” of the nuclear program was at an “absolute stalemate.” According to Safeguards regional division director [PER Herman Nackaerts  ] , [ORG IAEA  ] inspectors’ first visit to the enrichment facility under construction near [LOC Qom  ] had run predictably but without extraordinary responsiveness on [MISC Iran’s  ] part ; the [ORG Secretariat  ] was still trying to understand the motivation to build the plant as now designed . 
[PER Nackaerts  ] described the frustrating limitations of [MISC Iran’s  ] cooperation with the [ORG Agency  ] , and the [ORG STAFFDEL  ] deduced that [MISC Iranian  ] officials held back because they were uncertain about what lines of inquiry the [ORG IAEA  ] was best equipped to exploit . 
Questioning then-DG ElBaradei’s remark to media that the [ORG Agency  ] had found “nothing to worry about” in [LOC Qom  ] , [ORG STAFFDEL  ] asked if the [ORG Secretariat  ] would report on how it judged the plant did or did not fit into [MISC Iran’s  ] publicly explained nuclear program . 
[PER Nackaerts  ] expressed appreciation for the precision and usefulness of [MISC U.S.-supplied  ] information in the [LOC Qom  ] case and generally. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Summary contd.: On [LOC Syria  ] , [PER Nackaerts  ] said the [ORG Secretariat  ] had told [LOC Damascus  ] its first explanation for the presence of anthropogenic uranium at the Miniature Neutron Source Reactor was not credible . 
Further , the [ORG Secretariat  ] still could not yet present the case for how what was being built at [LOC Dair Alzour  ] fit in as “part of a [MISC Syrian  ] program or part of someone else’s program.” On [LOC DPRK  ] , IAEA/EXPO’s [PER Tariq Rauf  ] said the [ORG IAEA  ] , when it could , would ultimately have to “go back to the early 1990s” to reconstruct accountancy of plutonium and could not accept a “political” compromise setting material “off to the side.” To get to a finding of “no diversion” would take several years and extensive resources and forensics. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Contd.: Treating [ORG Technical Cooperation  ] , the [ORG STAFFDEL  ] received the same briefing on the Safeguards Department’s project review process and internal database that was provided to a [ORG GAO  ] review team in 2008 . 
[ORG IAEA External Relations  ] Director [PER Rauf  ] asserted , “We are not a denial organization.” [ORG STAFFDEL  ] related how segments of the [ORG GAO  ] report had reduced [ORG Congressional  ] confidence in the efficiency of [ORG TC  ] . 
[LOC U.S.  ] national labs were afforded too little time to review projects for our national decision-making on their merit and proliferation risk . 
[ORG Secretariat  ] also described hindrances it faces in having [ORG UN  ] and national development officials recognize and integrate nuclear applications. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Contd.: The [ORG STAFFDEL  ] also engaged P5-plus-1 heads of mission over lunch on the means to draw or impel [LOC Iran  ] to open up on its nuclear program and on dynamics in [LOC Vienna  ] between blocs of Member States . 
End Summary . 
Fordow/Qom and [LOC Iran  ] PMD: Frustration , but [ORG Good Support  ] from the [LOC U.S.  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG House Foreign Affairs Committee  ] ( [ORG HFAC  ] ) Majority Staff Director [PER Richard Kessler  ] and Professional Staff Member [PER David Fite  ] ( [ORG STAFFDEL  ] ) spent ninety minutes with [ORG IAEA  ] staff on November 10 . 
Principal issues were safeguards verification in [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Syria  ] , the screening of [ORG IAEA Technical Cooperation  ] ( [ORG TC  ] ) projects for proliferation risk , and [ORG TC Department  ] efforts to improve project design and integration into national and [ORG UN  ] development activities . 
[ORG STAFFDEL  ] affirmed to [ORG Secretariat  ] officials that the [ORG HFAC  ] under Chairman [PER Berman:  ] was strongly supportive of the [ORG IAEA  ] ; put emphasis on counter-proliferation issues in countries of concern ( indeed , was weighing legislation to impose further [LOC U.S.  ] sanctions on [LOC Iran  ] ) ; had advocated an increase in [LOC NADR  ] funding for extrabudgetary contributions to the [ORG IAEA  ] , including for the Safeguards Analytical laboratory ; and , supported “getting the [LOC U.S.  ] up to date” on payment of its assessments to the IAEA’s regular budget . 
Following the meeting at the [ORG IAEA  ] , [ORG STAFFDEL  ] consulted Ambassador and Mission staff and had a working lunch with P5-plus-1 heads of mission focused on [LOC Iran  ] and the dynamics of multilateral UNVIE VIEN 00000540 002 OF 005 diplomacy in [LOC Vienna  ] . 
STAFFDEL’s UNVIE program followed a day of consultations with [MISC Austrian  ] officials ( reftel ) . <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG IAEA Safeguards Department Operations B  ] ( AOR Mideast , [LOC South Asia  ] , parts of [LOC Europe  ] , the [ORG Americas  ] , and all nuclear weapons states ) Director [PER Herman Nackaerts  ] briefed [ORG STAFFDEL  ] on the inspection he had led a few weeks before to the recently disclosed [ORG Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant  ] near [LOC Qom  ] in [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Nackaerts  ] said [MISC Iranian  ] officials had been open to allowing inspectors access . 
The [ORG Secretariat  ] was still trying to understand , he said , why [LOC Iran  ] would build this facility , scaled as it was for 3000 centrifuges in contrast to the much large [LOC Natanz  ] facility . 
It was positive , [PER Nackaerts  ] pointed out , that [ORG Fordow  ] was now under safeguards . 
He noted that the [ORG IAEA  ] had “at least two” safeguards inspectors at work in [LOC Iran  ] “every day of the year” and would henceforth plan to visit [ORG Fordow  ] regularly . 
Asked how “complete” the plant was or when it would be operational , [PER Nackaerts  ] said , “The information we got from Member States proved to be very precise” on this point . 
Asked about permission to take samples at [ORG Fordow  ] , [PER Nackaerts  ] replied that [MISC Iranian  ] officials had permitted the inspectors to perform the same safeguards procedures they typically undertook at [LOC Natanz.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) [ORG STAFFDEL  ] asked if the [ORG Agency  ] enjoyed full access to the [MISC Arak IR-40  ] plant . 
[PER Nackaerts  ] related there had been no access for a 12-month period but normal access in August and October 2009 . 
However , the [MISC Iranians  ] “claim they cannot go back on the decision of their parliament , and hence grant the [ORG IAEA  ] a “visit” but do not call it [ORG Design Information Verification  ] . 
On possible military dimensions ( [ORG PMD  ] ) , [PER Nackaerts  ] said the [MISC Secretariat’s  ] approach was to follow lines of inquiry that could involve use of nuclear material , for example , the documents treating uranium metal or green salt . 
The [MISC Iranians  ] , he said in a tone conveying his skepticism , asserted the uranium metal document was “mistakenly” included in a packet of information they received from the [PER AQ Khan  ] network but was nothing [LOC Iran  ] had asked for or used . 
The “green salt” documentation [LOC Iran  ] dismissed as a forgery . 
Indeed , [PER Nackaerts  ] went on , [LOC Iran  ] replied basically on the form of documents , not on their substance . 
The [ORG Secretariat  ] had not been “impressed” by the 117-page rejoinder [LOC Iran  ] had provided to the initial presentation of [ORG PMD  ] documentation . 
It had told [LOC Iran  ] the information hung together too much for it all to have bee fabricated and asked that , if some of the documentation were “doctored , ” [MISC Iranian  ] officials should show the [ORG Secretariat  ] “where the truth ends.” Since August 2008 , ( when [PER Ahmadinejad  ] personally shut off [ORG Nackaerts’s  ] previously approved visit to workshops indicated in the documentation ) , [PER Nackaerts  ] concluded , there remained a high-level decision not to cooperate . 
[ORG STAFFDEL  ] member [PER Fite  ] took from this that the [MISC Iranians  ] were holding back “because they don’t know where any opening will lead.” [PER Nackaerts  ] agreed , saying they knew that every question they answered would bring another question. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) [PER Fite  ] alluded to then-DG ElBaradei’s remarks of a few days before in [LOC U.S.  ] media to the effect that the inspectors had found “nothing to worry about” in [ORG Fordow  ] . 
Acknowledging the practical meaning of this remark -- that there were no centrifuges or nuclear material present -- [PER Fite  ] nevertheless regretted the headline and asked if the DG’s formal report to [ORG Board  ] members ( Note: subsequently released as GOV/2009/74 , deresticted by the [ORG Board  ] November 27 , and available to the public at www.iaea.org ) would deal with how [LOC Qom  ] fits or does not fit into Iran’s explained nuclear program . 
[PER Nackaerts  ] replied , “We will identify the issues we’re working.” He went on that understanding the timeline of [MISC Fordow’s  ] development was hindered by Iran’s practice never to involve people who really know the facts or the government’s intentions in discussion with the [ORG Agency  ] . 
The officials with whom inspectors meet clearly are “steered” by unseen observers , who send notes to the [MISC Iranian  ] interlocutors during meetings . 
[LOC Iran  ] recorded the meetings , he added , but did not permit the [ORG IAEA  ] to do so . 
Further , the [ORG Secretariat  ] never received original design documents , but ones produced for the [ORG Secretariat  ] that were technically true to the facilities they found upon inspection . 
Against this [MISC Iranian  ] practice , [PER Nackaerts  ] added , the [ORG Secretariat  ] received very precise information from Member States that helped inspectors decide what to ask about . 
The organization of this information was good and , while the [ORG Agency  ] was satisfied , it had inquired if more information could be shared with the [ORG Agency  ] , “not necessarily for release to [LOC Iran  ] , ” he said . 
[LOC Syria  ] Stalemate UNVIE VIEN 00000540 003 OF 005 --------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [LOC Syria  ] case , [PER Nackaerts  ] said , was starting to look like [LOC Iran  ] in that the government provided “good cooperation” on some areas but presented a “stalemate” on others . 
The [ORG Secretariat  ] challenged [ORG Syria’s  ] proposed explanation for the presence of uranium at Dair [PER Alzour/Al Kibar  ] ( i.e. , that [MISC Israeli  ] depleted uranium munitions could be the source ) , but the inquiry was at a roadblock . 
[MISC Syrian  ] officials had been told their first explanation for anthropogenic uranium at the Miniature Neutron Source Reactor ( [ORG MNSR  ] ) was not credible , and the [ORG Agency  ] had inquired what nuclear material [LOC Syria  ] could have had that was not previously declared . 
Overall , the [ORG IAEA  ] still “did not understand” ( meaning , it could not yet present the solid case for ) how Dair Alzour fit in as part of a [MISC Syrian  ] nuclear program “or part of someone else’s program.” Return to [LOC DPRK  ] ? 
Safeguards in [LOC India  ] ? -------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Asked how quickly [ORG IAEA  ] inspectors could resume work in [LOC North Korea  ] if re-admitted by the government , [PER Tariq Rauf  ] of [ORG IAEA External Relations and Policy Coordination  ] ( [ORG EXPO  ] ) observed that the last resumption had taken a week ( for technical set-up , re-activation of cameras , etc . 
) . 
Safeguards Operations A division had a program set out for what steps to undertake “under circumstances the [LOC DPRK  ] may let us back in.” [PER Rauf  ] continued that the [ORG Agency  ] would to go back to the early 1990s’ plutonium revelation to reconstruct material accountancy . 
When most recently in the [LOC DPRK  ] , the [ORG IAEA  ] had been monitoring facility shutdown processes but not implementing NPT safeguards on [LOC DPRK  ] material . 
The [ORG Agency  ] could “not accept” political compromises that would set some nuclear material “off to the side” . 
[PER Then-DG ElBaradei  ] had called for implementation of the Additional Protocol in [LOC DPRK  ] , but even if [LOC Pyongyang  ] cooperated fully it would take several years and much in the way of resources and forensics to be able to get to a finding of “no diversion.” <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Asked about progress toward safeguards implementation in [LOC India  ] , [PER Rauf  ] confirmed the [MISC GOI  ] had submitted a “formal list” of facilities that was not a document the [ORG Agency  ] would characterize as a formal declaration under its safeguards agreement . 
[LOC India  ] was under no mandatory timeline to make its declaration as it was not an NPT signatory . 
( Comment: Rauf’s characterization was flat wrong . 
Mission had learned from the [ORG Safeguards Department  ] three weeks before this meeting that [LOC India  ] had officially “notified” two new facilities ( [ORG Raps  ] 5 and 6 ) under its 2008 safeguards agreement , that surveillance systems had been installed , and the facilities were under safeguards . 
End Comment . 
) Scrutinizing and Promoting [ORG IAEA Technical Cooperation  ] -------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( U ) [PER Renaud Chatelus  ] of the [ORG Safeguards Division of Information Management  ] ( [ORG SGIM  ] ) acquainted [ORG STAFFDEL  ] with [ORG IAEA  ] screening of [ORG Technical Cooperation  ] ( [ORG TC  ] ) projects for their potential to afford access to sensitive technologies . 
Grounded in a 1979 [ORG Agency Information Circular  ] , [ORG INFCIRC/267  ] , the practice is to focus on projects related to enrichment , heavy water production , reprocessing of spent fuel , and plutonium or mixed oxide fuel . 
[PER Chatelus  ] said [ORG SGIM  ] reviewed projects submitted , project approved , individual procurement actions , and overall implementation of projects . 
Reviews are conducted completely in-house , he said in reply to a question . 
Using the same PowerPoint slides that were presented to a [ORG GAO  ] review team in 2008 , [PER Chatelus  ] illustrated with screen shots from the [MISC Agency’s  ] staff access-only database the system of flagging projects for: compliance with [ORG INFCIRC  ] 267 , compliance with [ORG INFCIRC  ] 540 ( Additional Protocol ) , transfer of “sensitive items” on the [ORG Nuclear Suppliers Group  ] or dual-use lists , general interest , or possible relation to a safeguarded facility . 
In subsequent discussion of the impact of screening and Member [MISC States’  ] sense of entitlement to [ORG TC  ] , EXPO’s [PER Tariq Rauf  ] affirmed , “We are not a denial organization.” <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( U ) [ORG STAFFDEL  ] member [PER Fite  ] observed that segments of the [ORG GAO  ] report treating transfers to state sponsors of terrorism as well as on program management had reduced [ORG Congressional  ] confidence about [ORG TC  ] . 
[PER Fite  ] said he had approached Appropriations staff about using a supplemental funding bill UNVIE VIEN 00000540 004 OF 005 to resolve slow [LOC U.S.  ] payment of assessments and do more for the [ORG Agency  ] , but was rebuffed because the [ORG GAO  ] report on [ORG TC  ] had “poisoned the waters.” Apart from political objections to certain [ORG TC  ] recipients benefitting from [LOC U.S.  ] funding , he added , a persisting “Achilles heel” was that [LOC U.S.  ] national labs were afforded too little time to review projects for our national decision-making on their merit and proliferation risk . 
[ORG TC Department  ] representative [PER Johannes Seybold  ] replied that the [ORG Agency aimed  ] to provide Member States six weeks time for review , but was also at the mercy of requesting states providing the relevant project information . 
Just the compendium of project titles and short descriptions became a very thick document in each biennial cycle , [PER Seybold  ] went on , and the [ORG Agency  ] was “struggling” with some Member [MISC States’  ] national policies to be able to go beyond this level of transparency. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( U ) STAFFDEL’s meeting with [ORG Secretariat  ] officials concluded in an exchange with [PER Seybold  ] , TC’s section head for strategy and partnerships , about the [ORG IAEA’s  ] awkward position in development efforts coordinated by the [ORG UN  ] or by developing countries’ national institutions . 
[PER Seybold  ] laid out the following . 
The [ORG IAEA’s  ] cooperation with [ORG TC  ] recipient states occurs through National Liaison Officers , generally in the atomic energy commission or government ministry responsible for nuclear power or radiological sources . 
Generally , neither the [ORG IAEA  ] nor the corresponding national entity is a participant in [ORG UN  ] development team or host government deliberations about development in the recipient country . 
Two-thirds of [ORG TC  ] projects address development issues for which the [ORG IAEA  ] is not the responsible lead agency in the [ORG UN  ] system , e.g. , water quality and availability , food security , climate . 
In many cases , national authorities and the [ORG UN  ] team responsible for these areas in a given country lack awareness of [ORG IAEA  ] capabilities , and/or they maintain a distance from things “nuclear.” [PER Seybold  ] related [ORG Agency  ] efforts to integrate with these authorities through the [ORG UNDAF  ] ( [ORG UN Development Assistance Framework  ] ) process and other partnering efforts . 
[ORG STAFFDEL  ] expressed encouragement for bringing nuclear applications to greater impact in the development field . 
P5-plus-1 Ambassadors Regret [MISC Iranian  ] Paralysis on [ORG TRR  ] ; [PER Depict Grim Dynamic  ] with [MISC G-77/NAM  ] --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [ORG STAFFDEL  ] was the guests of honor at lunch hosted by the Ambassador with his counterparts from [LOC China  ] , [LOC Germany  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , and the [LOC UK  ] and the [MISC French Charge  ] d’Affaires . 
[PER Kessler  ] and [PER Fite  ] laid out HFAC’s interest and Chairman Berman’s supportive posture toward the [ORG Agency  ] , as they had for [ORG Secretariat  ] staff . 
Opening discussion of [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC UK  ] Ambassador [PER Simon Smith  ] said the [MISC Iranian  ] answer on the [MISC ElBaradei-brokered  ] deal on refueling the [LOC Tehran  ] research reactor ( [ORG TRR  ] ) “had to be ‘yes’ or ‘no , ’ not waffling” as it had been . 
[MISC German  ] Ambassador [PER Ruediger Luedeking  ] posited that the [ORG U.S. Administration  ] had confounded [MISC Iranian  ] internal processes and the latest EU3 proposal had “cornered” [LOC Iran  ] . 
Agreeing that [LOC Iran  ] faced an imperative between “yes” and “no , ” [PER Luedeking  ] observed , “they can’t answer.” HFAC Staff Director [PER Kessler  ] noted the committee had tried to follow up a [ORG Larijani  ] approach conveyed one year before for a meeting with Chairman [PER Berman  ] , but found that the [MISC Iranians  ] backed off. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador [PER Alexander Zmeyevskiy  ] asserted that confidentiality was a major concern for [LOC Iran  ] . 
He noted its [ORG TRR  ] counter-proposals , either to keep its [ORG LEU  ] on its territory under [ORG IAEA  ] safeguards until released in exchange for fuel rods , or to swap outgoing [ORG LEU  ] piecemeal for incoming fuel assemblies . 
Moving beyond the [ORG TRR  ] issue , [LOC UK  ] Ambassador said he was severely disappointed that Member States had been unable to “apply consequences for the breaking of rules” of the organization . 
We needed to convince some other Member States , he continued , that tolerating rule breaking as on [LOC Qom  ] and Code 3.1 ( of the [ORG Subsidiary Arrangement of Iran’s Safeguards Agreement  ] ) risked bringing the organization into discredit . 
[ORG STAFFDEL  ] member [PER Fite  ] asked if [ORG Iran’s Arab  ] neighbors were among the problem interlocutors in [LOC Vienna  ] ; he asserted that officials of [LOC Arabian Peninsula  ] countries told the [ORG Congress  ] they see [LOC Iran  ] as an “existential threat.” While they may seek the cover of international signals or sanctions imposed by others , they say they do want action against [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) Segueing from [LOC Iran  ] to [LOC DPRK  ] , [MISC Chinese  ] Ambassador [PER Hu Xiaodi  ] said the main difference between the cases was that progress with [LOC DPRK  ] had been achieved when the [LOC North Koreans  ] UNVIE VIEN 00000540 005 OF 005 wanted something specific , whereas he ( [PER Hu  ] ) had never heard [MISC Iranian  ] officials say that they wanted a settlement , or that they wanted anything specific . 
Although we did not at present know “how” to reach a deal with [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Hu  ] concluded , we were not in the worst situation , in which [LOC Iran  ] explicitly does want something -- nuclear weapons . 
Asked if he genuinely thought the [LOC DPRK  ] would give up its weapons program for aid , [PER Hu  ] said “hope” ( as opposed to “think.” ) Ambassador [PER Davies  ] seriously questioned that [LOC Pyongyang  ] would give up a weapons capability in exchange for a significant material improvement in our relations , as the government would likely calculate it had been its possession of weapons that won the concessions. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Ambassador turned the discussion to the dynamic between groups of Member States , as illustrated in the ongoing discussion of a [ORG Technical Cooperation  ] project to advance [ORG IAEA  ] use of “results based management.” The [MISC German  ] Ambassador observed that [ORG NAM  ] positions on many issues were characterized by “myths” and they were clearly being dictated by [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Egypt  ] . 
Ambassador [PER Davies  ] asked if the dynamic was further charged by states beginning to suspect that the [LOC U.S.  ] seriously intends to strengthen the [ORG Agency  ] in all its functions -- with the uncertain shifts in practice and distribution of resources and clout that could mean . 
[ORG STAFFDEL  ] lead [PER Kessler  ] said the [ORG Congressional  ] perception was one of a “lightning change” from the last [ORG Administration  ] to the present one in [LOC U.S.  ] approaches to the [ORG IAEA  ] , to development assistance globally , and to multilateralism . 
[MISC German  ] Ambassador agreed and said this was a complication for [ORG NAM  ] states that know they are the immobile ones now . 
Yet , [ORG TC  ] was a “sacred cow” and the [MISC NAM’s  ] impulse was to reject “illegitimate intrusion” into its distribution. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC French Charge  ] [PER Philippe Merlin  ] discouraged [ORG STAFFDEL  ] from expecting diplomatic gains , say in the NPT review , through greater generosity on [ORG IAEA  ] peaceful use programs. “TC is the price we pay , ” he said , for developing countries’ acquiescence toward the safeguards regime , the thing we really want . 
[PER Fite  ] asked if a reasoned discussion with development officials in capitals about making [ORG TC  ] deliver more impact could translate into different instructions to the obstreperous missions in [LOC Vienna  ] . 
[MISC German  ] Ambassador took the view that any effort to change [ORG TC  ] would be seen in capitals as “per se bad.” It was more advisable to advocate to [ORG NAM  ] states what their own interests in the safeguards regime were . 
[LOC UK  ] Ambassador agreed there were no points to be scored by asking [ORG NAM  ] capitals about [ORG TC  ] effectiveness ; he added that the [ORG UK Government  ] “doesn’t give two hoots” about [ORG TC  ] , given the small funding level ( from the [ORG UK Energy Ministry  ] ) in comparison to [MISC Britain’s  ] official development assistance . 
[ORG TC  ] was , also in the [LOC UK  ] view , the price we pay for the [ORG IAEA  ] we want. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( U ) [ORG STAFFDEL  ] did not review this report .
