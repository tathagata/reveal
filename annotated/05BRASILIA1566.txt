( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary . 
The financial situation of [ORG VARIG  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] 's troubled flagship carrier , is worsening . 
Airline officials have told Deputy Senior Commercial Officer that in the absence of some sort of rescue package the company would only survive 30 days . 
So far , however , key [ORG GOB  ] officials have not signed on to the restructuring deal being negotiated by [ORG VARIG  ] 's new board . 
Meanwhile , one of companies which leases aircraft to [ORG VARIG  ] has demanded the return of its planes because of the failure of the airline to pay the lease expenses . 
We foresee the current crisis shortly becoming very public and very messy . 
End Summary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On June 7 , USCS Deputy Senior Commercial Officer ( [ORG DSCO  ] ) telephoned Vice-President ( and Defense Minister ) [PER Alencar  ] 's Chief of Staff to inquire about the status of [ORG VARIG  ] . 
Our interlocutor pledged to pass this query to [ORG VARIG  ] ; ten minutes later [ORG VARIG President  ] [PER Henrique Neves  ] called back to relay the following information: -- On May 9 , [ORG VARIG  ] 's management was taken over by a new board of directors comprised of executives from major multinational corporations doing business in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
The [ORG Rubem Berta Foundation  ] ( i.e. , the [ORG VARIG  ] employee association ) , which proved incapable of making difficult decisions , now no longer has any direct involvement in company management . 
-- [ORG VARIG  ] and the [MISC Portuguese  ] airline [ORG TAP  ] are working on a 4-stage plan to return the company to financial health . 
Stage 1 of the plan contemplates conversion of much of [ORG VARIG  ] 's outstanding debt into equity shares of a reorganized corporation . 
-- Stage 2 of the plane envisions [ORG TAP  ] purchasing 20 percent ( [MISC US$300  ] to $400 million ) of the reorganized corporation . 
This , along with the debt restructuring , would generate approximately [MISC US$500  ] million . 
-- Stage 3 involves [ORG VARIG  ] and the [ORG GOB  ] coming to an accord , whereby the latter agrees to drop its appeals to a [MISC US$1.1  ] billion judgment in the airline 's favor and [ORG VARIG  ] , after a six-month grace period , agrees to start paying its debt to the [ORG GOB  ] . 
-- Finally , in Stage 4 the shares from the newly-formed [ORG VARIG  ] would be sold on the market and the creditors who became asset holders would then receive their cash. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Significant obstacles stand in the way of the realization of this plan . 
First , [ORG VARIG  ] reports that while creditors such as [ORG Boeing  ] and [ORG GE Engines  ] have agreed to the plan , leasing companies with newer planes - such as the [ORG International Lease Financing Corporation  ] ( [ORG ILFC  ] ) , a subsidiary of [LOC AIG  ] -- are balking as they believe that their aircraft could be profitably diverted to another paying lessee . 
[ORG VARIG  ] worries that if [ORG ILFC  ] , which supplies 11 of the company 's 82 aircraft , remains recalcitrant , other lessors ( like [ORG GECAS  ] , [ORG GE  ] 's leasing arm ) may adopt a similar stance . 
( Indeed , even the extent to which [ORG Boeing  ] is on board is still up in the air as in our contacts with [ORG Boeing  ] representatives they declined to confirm any accord with [ORG VARIG  ] . 
) And without the debt-for-equity swap , [ORG TAP  ] would not proceed with the purchase of 20 percent of the restructured company. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Second , key questions such as who would control the restructured company and the status of [ORG TAP  ] 's debt to the [ORG GOB  ] remain unresolved . 
Given its substantial investment , presumably [ORG TAP  ] would want a majority of the voting ( as opposed to the common ) shares of the company . 
However , [MISC Brazilian  ] law explicitly provides that foreign investors in the aviation sector may hold no more than 20 percent of the voting shares of a carrier . 
In addition , [ORG TAP  ] itself owes approximately [MISC US$23  ] million in taxes to the [ORG GOB  ] , although it maintains that a 2002 presidential decree partially extinguished at least part of this debt. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Third , the [ORG GOB  ] has not yet agreed to drop its appeal in the [MISC US$1.1  ] billion court case , nor has it agreed to the six-month moratorium on payment of outstanding debt owed to government agencies . 
Presidential Chief of Staff [PER Jose Dirceu  ] publicly characterized a recent meeting between [ORG VARIG  ] , [ORG TAP  ] , and high-level [PER Lula  ] administration officials on this issue as a " waste of time , " federal attorneys who have reviewed the matter have weighed in against such a transaction . 
Among other things , [PER Dirceu  ] and Finance Minister [PER Palocci  ] likely worry that if the government cuts a special deal for [ORG VARIG  ] , it may face similar demands from both plaintiffs with similar lawsuits and recalcitrant debtors with just as compelling excuses . 
For its part , [ORG VARIG  ] reports that [PER Dirceu  ] has pledged that the [ORG GOB  ] will analyze the carrier 's proposal and respond within ten days after the June 2 meeting . 
Meanwhile , [ORG VARIG  ] says the [ORG GOB  ] has released [MISC US$40  ] million in cash to allow the company to make its payroll. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Finally , even after the restructuring was completed , [PER Neves  ] told [ORG DSCO  ] that the company would need to lay off 5,000 employees and gain access for four to six months to a [MISC US$100-150,000  ] line of cash per month . 
And while the new airline would possess key national and international routes , it would also inherit a fleet of aging , high-maintenance aircraft , declining market share , and stiff competition from an increasing array of low-cost domestic carriers. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment . 
There is ample reason to believe that the hour of reckoning for [ORG VARIG  ] has arrived . 
Unidentified [ORG VARIG  ] officials have been quoted in the local press as stating that without a rescue package the airline won't be able to survive past year 's end . 
[PER Neves  ] was even more pessimistic , declaring that if the restructuring did not work the airline would only survive 30 days . 
While [ORG VARIG  ] certainly has an ulterior motive for emphasizing its dire straits , the tone of its contacts with the Embassy over the past few days has become increasingly desperate . 
Whether the proposed restructuring will inject enough capital into the carrier to actually satisfy all the creditors will soon become apparent . 
Now could truly be make or break time for the airline. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While Vice President [PER Alencar  ] -- the [ORG GOB  ] 's principal point man on [ORG VARIG  ] issues -- has vacillated between a bail-out and the " let the market resolve the situation " option , [ORG VARIG  ] 's selection of a new management team may well have precipitated its end rather than its rescue . 
The new president of the company 's [ORG Administrative Council  ] is [PER David Zylbersztajn  ] , the son-in-law of former President ( and now opposition leader ) [PER Fernando Henrique Cardoso  ] . 
Analysts here had worried that [PER Zylbersztajn  ] and his hand-picked team , members of which are closely associated with the PSDB - i.e. , the rival party to the [PER Lula  ] administration , would set [ORG VARIG  ] on a " collision " course with the [LOC GOB.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Who blinks first and the ultimate consequences for [ORG VARIG  ] are still open questions . 
While the demise of [ORG VARIG  ] , for years the country 's flagship carrier , would definitely be a bitter pill for the [MISC Brazilian  ] public to swallow , the prospect of a cash-strapped government using public funds to heal a private company is medicine just as unpalatable .
