( C ) Summary: Some eight weeks into the [ORG Funes Administration  ] , we are beginning to see more clearly the trends and factions inside the [ORG GOES  ] . 
President [PER Mauricio Funes'  ] non-FMLN campaign support group , the Friends of [PER Mauricio  ] , is largely in control of the economic apparatus of [LOC El Salvador  ] . 
Similarly , Defense is in the hands of a formerly-retired , recently-promoted military officer and Friend of [PER Mauricio  ] , [ORG Brigadier General  ] [PER David Munguia Payes  ] . 
[MISC FMLN  ] hard-liners are at the helm of the security and intelligence apparatus . 
Foreign policy is in the hands of a loyal [MISC FMLN  ] member , but has thus far been characterized by pragmatism and outreach to the [LOC U.S.  ] Assistance programs broadly mirror the rest of the relationship , with most programs moving forward successfully but some police and security programs under review . 
The [ORG Funes GOES  ] has made poverty eradication its highest priority . 
End Summary. -------- The Good -------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The [ORG Funes Administration  ] inherited two serious economic problems . 
First , the [MISC Salvadoran  ] economy likely entered recession in late 2008 , driven by falling remittances and declining exports because of the [LOC U.S.  ] recession . 
Second , the government was effectively broke ) and in many cases behind on its bills ) because of declining tax revenues and the [MISC Saca Administration’s  ] lavish , election-year subsidies . 
So far , the government has chosen to seek new funding from the [ORG World Bank  ] , [ORG Inter-American Development Bank  ] , and [ORG International Monetary Fund  ] , rather than from sources like [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
The government 's " [ORG Anti-Crisis Plan  ] " likewise appears to consist primarily of increased funding for existing social programs . 
These programs , however , will likely do little to boost the economy , where recovery ultimately depends on the recovery in the [LOC U.S.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Since June 1 , [MISC Salvadoran  ] foreign policy has also been characterized by pragmatism . 
Foreign Minister [PER Hugo Martinez  ] stepped into the chair at the [ORG OAS General Assembly  ] in [LOC San Pedro  ] Sula just hours after assuming his new role ; he impressed both the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation and [MISC Salvadoran  ] observers with his performance . 
Since then , the main foreign policy issue faced by the [ORG GOES  ] has been [LOC Honduras  ] . 
In the hours after President [PER Zelaya  ] 's expulsion to [LOC Costa Rica  ] , both [PER Martinez  ] and [ORG Funes  ] reached out to the Embassy and to [LOC Washington  ] to coordinate what has been a reasonable , responsible approach to the crisis on their northern border . 
On [PER Funes'  ] first day in office he recognized [LOC Cuba  ] , but balanced this by meeting Secretary [PER Clinton  ] and the [LOC USDEL  ] to his inauguration . 
[MISC FMLN  ] hardliners , particularly Vice President [PER Sanchez Ceren  ] , would prefer an [MISC ALBA-esque  ] foreign policy and carry out a parallel [MISC FMLN  ] agenda , but they are not permitted to wreck relations with traditional partners . 
Ambassadorial appointments are being made in a deliberate , unhurried fashion , and have not raised concerns ; indeed , keeping former FM [PER Francisco Lainez  ] in place at the [ORG OAS  ] sent an early signal of continuity. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) On foreign assistance , [ORG USAID  ] reports good cooperation across the board , save for some difficulties in public security . 
( More on that below . 
) The [ORG GOES  ] has voiced strong support for continuing [ORG USAID  ] programs and has indicated it is in agreement with [ORG USAID  ] 's strategic goals for [LOC El Salvador  ] . 
The [ORG Funes Administration  ] has elevated to Vice Minister the MFA position responsible for coordinating foreign assistance programs and has called for the formulation of a global cooperation strategy . 
The [ORG GOES  ] is actively leveraging international donors to address its near-term anti-crisis plan . 
In charge of both economic policy and donor coordination is [PER Alex Segovia  ] , the President 's Chief of Cabinet . 
[PER Segovia  ] , a kind of super-minister , is the most pragmatic and least ideological figure in the [LOC GOES.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOES  ] just reaffirmed its continued interest in [ORG USAID  ] 's programs for improved tax collection , health sector reform and a diagnostic of the education system . 
[ORG MCC  ] 's rate of implementation continues to gain speed , in large degree because of the efforts of local partner [ORG FOMILENIO  ] 's Director , [PER Jose Angel Quiroz  ] . 
We successfully pushed back against a move by [ORG Funes  ] to replace [PER Quiroz  ] in the early days of his government , arguing that another disruption in [ORG FOMILENIO  ] management would set back [ORG MCC  ] 's program by months , if not more . 
It was [PER Segovia  ] , in his role as [ORG FOMILENIO Board  ] Chairman , who convinced [ORG Funes  ] to leave [PER Quiros  ] in place . 
The new [ORG GOES  ] has shown great interest in the [ORG MCC  ] indicators ; [PER Segovia  ] just wrote a warm letter to [ORG MCC  ] CEO [PER Rodney Bent  ] recommitting the [ORG GOES  ] to the indicators and all other [ORG MCC  ] criteria. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Military-to-military cooperation continues at a tempo similar to that before [ORG Funes  ] took office . 
The [ORG USNS Comfort  ] recently spent 11 days anchored offshore and saw more than 19,000 [MISC Salvadoran  ] patients . 
We have three other [MISC Medical Readiness Training Exercises  ] scheduled for 2009 and a full slate of DOD/SA-funded training for members of the [ORG Salvadoran Armed Forces  ] ( [ORG ESAF  ] ) . 
Additionally , the [ORG MOD  ] has requested [ORG USG  ] support to conduct a [ORG National Security Strategy  ] ( [ORG NSS  ] ) workshop with the intent to get Cabinet level and Assembly personnel involved in the [ORG GOES  ] process to develop their own [ORG NSS  ] . 
Appointment of retired Colonel [PER Munguia Payes  ] as Minister of Defense , as well as mid-ranked active duty colonels to most key command positions , has created discomfort in [ORG ESAF  ] ranks . 
However , the Minister of Defense is an institutionalist and is focused on maintaining the [ORG ESAF  ] 's apolitical professionalism . 
The Minister and the [ORG ESAF  ] are loyal supporters of the president , and eager to continue longstanding mil-to-mil relationships with the [LOC U.S.  ] ------- The Bad ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) [MISC Salvadorans  ] across the spectrum link [PER Manuel Melgar  ] , now Minister of [ORG Public Security and Justice  ] , to the 1985 [PER Zona Rosa  ] attack which killed four off-duty [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy [ORG Marine Security Guards  ] and other [MISC Americans  ] and [MISC Salvadorans  ] . 
[PER Melgar  ] 's nomination appears to have been based less on his public security credentials than on the hard-line [MISC FMLN  ] 's insistence that they control public security . 
This was their " pound of flesh " in exchange for " Friends of [PER Mauricio  ] " controlling the economy . 
[PER Melgar  ] 's presence as Minister has resulted in a distancing from the [ORG USG  ] , a far cry from the close relationship we enjoyed with his predecessor . 
Law enforcement cooperation has not been frozen , but full implementation of the [ORG Merida Initiative  ] is now contingent upon guidance from [LOC Washington  ] regarding how best to work around [PER Melgar  ] . 
Just as disappointing is the cynical message it sends to a high-crime society like [LOC El Salvador  ] when the President names as Minister of [ORG Public Security  ] an individual with blood on his hands. ------------ And the Ugly ------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Traditional feuds between the [MISC Salvadoran  ] right and left and modern feuds between [ORG Funes  ] and the [MISC FMLN  ] are playing out in other contexts . 
Over two weeks after the legal deadline ( June 30 ) to appoint five new magistrates to the [ORG Supreme Court  ] , the [ORG Salvadoran Legislative Assembly  ] remained deadlocked as the governing [MISC FMLN  ] and [MISC ARENA-led  ] opposition coalition could not reach agreement on a list of names . 
( [ORG Note: Supreme Court  ] appointments require a 2/3 supermajority , thus demanding [ORG ARENA  ] and the [MISC FMLN  ] support any nominee . 
End note . 
) Naming a new [ORG Attorney General  ] ( which also requires a 2/3 Assembly vote ) became linked to the [ORG Supreme Court  ] selections and the entire process ground to a halt . 
The [ORG Supreme Court  ] was made whole July 16 when a deal was struck between [ORG Funes  ] , the [MISC FMLN  ] , and opposition on a slate of nominees . 
Public and private negotiations continue over the new [ORG Attorney General.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) [LOC El Salvador  ] 's intelligence service ( [ORG OIE  ] ) in the hands of orthodox [MISC FMLN  ] member [PER Eduardo Linares  ] could become ugly , depending upon how much leeway [ORG Funes  ] allows him to accept advice , training , money , and personnel from [LOC Cuba  ] or [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
To date [PER Linares  ] has behaved cautiously , first seeking to get his arms around his own organization , which , to be fair , had previously considered the [MISC FMLN  ] as its primary target. ------------------------------------- Pursuing [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Interests Going Forward  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Eight weeks on , we are roughly where we expected to be . 
We have enjoyed excellent cooperation in most areas with the [ORG GOES  ] , but lost some ground in other areas , especially law enforcement . 
Given the inconsistent performance of [MISC Salvadoran  ] law enforcement in good times , it has been hard to discern a difference in performance , or crime statistics , since June 1 . 
Our assistance priorities , and continued trade relationship , seems closely aligned with the [ORG Funes Administration  ] 's own goals . 
Foreign policy priorities will sometimes diverge , although our problems are likely to be less with the official [ORG GOES  ] policies than with the [MISC FMLN  ] 's own parallel policies . 
The Embassy 's approach with the [ORG Funes Administration  ] will continue to be engagement across the board , even with [ORG Public Security  ] , up to and including the Deputy Minister . 
Our objective is to strengthen the institutions of [MISC Salvadoran  ] democracy , regardless of who is in power . 
[ORG Civil society  ] , media , and the business sector take a parallel and complementary approach . 
[ORG ARENA  ] did not disappear June 1 and its reorganization and regrouping is proceeding . 
It promises to remain a significant opposition during the entire five years of the [ORG Funes Administration  ] .
