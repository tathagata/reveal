End summary . 
Back to Running [LOC Tigre  ] --------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [MISC Argentine  ] former Cabinet Chief [PER Sergio Massa  ] looked tanned and well-rested when he met with [MISC Polcouns  ] September 4 , a little over a month after returning to [LOC Tigre  ] , the medium-sized city in suburban [LOC Buenos Aires  ] where he was elected mayor in 2007 but took a leave of absence to work one year for President [PER Cristina Fernandez  ] de [PER Kirchner  ] ( [ORG CFK  ] ) . 
[PER Massa  ] served as Cabinet Chief from July 24 , 2008 , through July 8 , 2009 , and returned to his mayor 's office in [LOC Tigre  ] two weeks later . 
Although the media had reported that [PER Massa  ] took his family skiing at the southern resort of [LOC Bariloche  ] , [PER Massa  ] grinned when [MISC Polcouns  ] asked him about the slopes and confessed that he had actually taken his family to a beach resort in northeastern [LOC Brazil  ] . 
He was clearly pleased that he had pulled a fast one on the media . 
Greatly Relieved ---------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Massa  ] stressed that he did not miss his highly visible Casa Rosada position one bit . 
The polls , he said , indicated he had left the [PER Kirchner  ] administration with his reputation and popularity intact . 
Tensions between [PER Massa  ] and former President [PER Nestor Kirchner  ] were rumored to be high , and [PER Massa  ] confirmed that to us in private . 
He claimed he parted on good terms with [ORG CFK  ] and " not so good terms " with [ORG CFK  ] 's husband and power behind the throne , former president [PER Nestor Kirchner  ] ( [ORG NK  ] ) . 
[PER Massa  ] said that [ORG CFK  ] deferred to her husband on all matters , and that in practice she had become nothing more than a subaltern who took orders and had no ability or inclination to overrule her husband 's policy decisions or countermand his orders to government ministers and their staffs . 
He also said that his replacement as Cabinet Chief , [PER Anibal Fernandez  ] , 52 , seemed to be making more enemies than allies , and that Interior Minister [PER Florencio Randazzo  ] , 45 , who a year earlier shared the limelight with [PER Massa  ] as one of [ORG CFK  ] 's most visible spokesmen , was a spent force in the administration . 
[ORG Kirchner Gearing Up  ] for 2011 ---------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Massa  ] described [ORG NK  ] as a master tactician who enjoyed a good fight and was ultimately seized with acquiring and asserting power for its own sake but did not have a vision nor the coalition-building skills needed to carry out an agenda . 
[PER Massa  ] said he believed [ORG NK  ] was intent on running for president in 2011 , and that [PER Daniel Scioli  ] , 52 , would run for re-election as governor of the province of [LOC Buenos Aires  ] on the [PER Kirchner  ] ticket . 
Asked about rumors that [ORG NK  ] and [PER Scioli  ] might switch -- i.e. , [PER Scioli  ] for president , and [ORG NK  ] for governor -- [PER Massa  ] said that might be a fallback plan . 
He said [PER Scioli  ] was stuck between a rock and a hard place , expressing some pity for [PER Scioli  ] 's inability to extricate himself from [PER Kirchner  ] 's grasp , particularly as the province is headed toward a severe fiscal crunch that will require a bailout from the national government . 
[PER Massa  ] 's Plans for 2011 ---------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Massa  ] was emphatic that he would not take the congressional seat he won in the June 28 elections , preferring instead to establish a strong record as mayor of [LOC Tigre  ] as a launching pad for his own gubernatorial bid in <a id='par2011' href='#par2011'>¶</a>2011 . 
He spoke at length about the need to build a capable team that he could take with him to govern the province . 
He noted that [ORG CFK  ] 's new minister of economy , [PER Amado Boudou  ] , seemed to be doomed for disaster because he did not have even a small team of trusted advisers to help him develop policy and run that portfolio. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In that connection , [PER Massa  ] said he had hired [PER Santiago Montoya  ] , the well-regarded former head of the provincial revenue service ( [ORG ARBA  ] ) who lost his job when he incurred [PER Kirchner  ] 's wrath by refusing to run as a candidate on the [PER Kirchner  ] slate in the June 28 congressional midterm elections . 
[PER Massa  ] also made a point of picking up his cell phone and calling [PER Emilio Monzo  ] , the provincial agriculture secretary whom [PER Scioli  ] had fired the week before , also at [PER Kirchner  ] 's behest . 
[PER Massa  ] 's end of the phone conversation made it clear he and [PER Monzo  ] were on good terms , and at the end of the conversation , [PER Massa  ] said he was looking to find a place for [PER Monzo  ] in his city administration . 
Labor Problems in [LOC Tigre  ] ----------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [MISC Polcouns  ] asked [PER Massa  ] about intractable labor problems at a food processing plant in [LOC Tigre  ] owned by [PER Kraft  ] . 
[PER Massa  ] said three times that he believed the company had been in the right when it dismissed 155 workers for failing to show up to work in July and then taking plant managers hostage in July . 
He implied that the labor leaders at the plant were extortionist and unreasonable . 
He made clear that he did not see a useful role for himself in resolving the standoff , and he was at a loss for predicting how it might end . 
Comment ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) As noted reftel , [PER Massa  ] , 37 , is smart , charismatic , and well-liked , with an open , inclusive style that did not fit well with the paranoid , combative Kirchners . 
He is generally pro-American and , unlike others in the [LOC GOA  ] , did not resort to any cheap shots against the [LOC United States  ] . 
Like his predecessor , [PER Alberto Fernandez  ] , he emerged relatively unscathed from his service in the [PER Kirchner  ] administration . 
He is focused now on positioning himself for the governor 's race in 2011 . 
In the interim , he clearly enjoys his job as mayor and is highly popular in [LOC Tigre  ] . 
Ambitious and young , he already has an impressive record of public service ( five years as head of [LOC ANSES  ] , the [MISC Argentine  ] social security administration ; a year as mayor of [LOC Tigre  ] ; and a year as Cabinet Chief ) . 
Most likely , he sees himself as a long-term presidential contender , and we would put him in the same generational league as other promising presidential prospects such as [LOC Salta  ] governor [PER Manuel Urtubey  ] , 40 , and [ORG Chaco  ] governor [PER Jorge Capitanich  ] , 44 .
