Reasons 1.4 ( b/d ) Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Current bilateral cooperation on arms control , nonproliferation and export control is “remarkable , ” [ORG MFA Department of Arms Control  ] Director General [PER Cheng Jingye  ] told [PER Staffdel Januzzi  ] March 24 . 
Nevertheless , there is a “perception” that the [LOC United States  ] counts on [ORG China’s  ] support on nonproliferation issues but does not fully trust [LOC China  ] as an equal partner . 
On [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC China  ] supports a dual approach which includes applying pressure via [ORG Security Council  ] resolutions and focusing on the diplomatic front . 
[ORG China’s  ] cooperation with [LOC Iran  ] on energy is unrelated to the [LOC Iran  ] nuclear issue and [PER Cheng  ] “can’t imagine” the consequences if [ORG Sinopec  ] is sanctioned . 
On [LOC North Korea  ] , [PER Cheng  ] urged the [LOC United States  ] to find a creative resolution to the declaration issue . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Frank Januzzi  ] and [PER Puneet Talwar  ] , staff members of the [ORG Senate Foreign Relations Committee  ] , met [ORG MFA Department of Arms Control  ] Director General [PER Cheng  ] Jingye March 24 to discuss [MISC Chinese  ] views on arms control , non-proliferation , [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC North Korea.  ] “Remarkable” Cooperation ------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Arms control , export controls and nonproliferation all contribute to [ORG China’s  ] security , said [PER Cheng  ] . 
A decade ago , cooperation between [LOC China  ] and the [LOC United States  ] focused on certain cases , but today’s level of cooperation on nonproliferation and arms control issues is “remarkable , ” [PER Cheng  ] said . 
For example , [LOC China  ] is actively involved in diplomatic negotiation efforts on [LOC North Korea  ] and [LOC Iran  ] . 
And in many areas of nonproliferation , said [PER Cheng  ] , the two countries see “eye-to-eye.” He referred to multilateral agreements such as the [ORG Nuclear Suppliers Group  ] ( [ORG NSG  ] ) , the [ORG Missile Technology Control Regime  ] ( [ORG MTCR  ] ) , the [ORG Australia Group  ] and the [ORG Wassenaar Arrangement  ] and said that even if [LOC China  ] is not a member of these various organizations , [LOC China  ] has in place its own export control regime . 
For example , there is interagency coordination on sensitive exports as well as alleged proliferation cases raised by the [LOC United States  ] . 
[PER Cheng  ] noted that while the pace of implementing arms control agreements has slowed in the past decade , [LOC China  ] is prepared to move the disarmament conference forward within the [ORG United Nations  ] framework . 
Equal Partners -------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Cheng  ] contended that there is a “perception” that the [LOC United States  ] counts on [ORG China’s  ] support and cooperation on nonproliferation issues but does not fully trust or treat [LOC China  ] as an equal partner . 
For example , in the 1990s , [LOC China  ] was invited to join the [ORG MTCR  ] and the [ORG Australia Group  ] but declined to join . 
Currently , however , [LOC China  ] is “not welcome , ” despite expressing a willingness to join , [PER Cheng  ] said . 
[LOC China  ] and the [LOC United States  ] need to cooperate on a “mutual , equal basis.” [PER Cheng  ] also raised the issue of sanctions against [ORG China Great Wall Industry Corporation  ] ( [ORG CGWIC  ] ) . 
[ORG CGWIC  ] has been subject to sanctions for ten years without “solid evidence , ” said [PER Cheng  ] . 
Over the past 3-4 years , [ORG CGWIC  ] has restructured the company , changed its business model and prohibited contacts with countries of concern to the [LOC United States  ] . 
[PER Cheng  ] expressed hope that the company would make progress during its March 20 meetings in [LOC Washington  ] . 
[LOC Iran  ] ---- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Cheng  ] said [LOC China  ] and the [LOC United States  ] share the same goal for Iran: no further proliferation of nuclear weapons . 
[LOC China  ] makes this point very clearly to the international community and to [LOC Iran  ] in the context of its private bilateral contacts . 
[ORG PRC  ] Foreign Minister [PER Yang Jiechi  ] told [MISC Iranian  ] leaders during his November visit to [LOC Iran  ] that [LOC China  ] is opposed to proliferation in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
[LOC China  ] supports the [PER UNSCRs  ] on [LOC Iran  ] and the [LOC P5-plus-1  ] process , emphasized [PER Cheng  ] . 
After the release of the [ORG National Intelligence Estimate  ] ( [ORG NIE  ] ) and [ORG IAEA  ] reports on [LOC Iran  ] last year , there is a need for more diplomatic efforts , [PER Cheng  ] said . 
[LOC China  ] supports a dual approach which includes applying pressure via [PER UNSCRs  ] and focusing on the diplomatic front. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) One of the dilemmas of the [LOC Iran  ] nuclear issue is that despite three [PER UNSCRs  ] , Iran’s capability to enrich uranium [LOC BEIJING  ] 00001141 002 OF 002 continues to expand , [PER Cheng  ] underscored . 
[LOC China  ] and other countries need to be “creative” in devising a proposal “attractive” to [LOC Iran  ] . 
The international community must find a way to ensure its concerns about Iran’s nuclear development are addressed and promote the peaceful development of nuclear energy , maintained [PER Cheng  ] . 
[PER Cheng  ] reasoned that if incentives do not work , then it will make applying pressure easier in the future because it shows that diplomacy was not effective . 
The [LOC P5-plus-1  ] meeting in [LOC Shanghai  ] in April will allow the ministers to discuss strategy on next steps . 
[PER Cheng  ] noted that a recent proposal from the [ORG United Nations Association  ] of the [LOC USA  ] ( [LOC UNA-USA  ] ) includes some interesting ideas and that his office is in the process of studying its proposal . 
[PER Cheng  ] said that [LOC Germany  ] has put forward a proposal to “refresh” previous offers . 
[LOC China  ] believes that the [LOC P5-plus-1  ] will need to offer new incentives to [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [LOC Iran  ] might be more willing to offer a reciprocal positive gesture on the nuclear issue if it does not feel threatened by regime change , [PER Cheng  ] said . 
Regarding Iran’s claim that it did not have a nuclear program prior to 2003 , [LOC China  ] is not in a position to comment without presentation of evidence and materials , [PER Cheng  ] said . 
[LOC China  ] continues to urge [LOC Iran  ] to cooperate with the [ORG IAEA  ] and encourages the [ORG IAEA  ] to play a greater role . 
[PER Cheng  ] also discussed possible incentives for [LOC Iran  ] after international confidence is restored , including reinstatement as a non-nuclear [ORG Nonproliferation Treaty  ] ( [ORG NPT  ] ) member , education cooperation , normalization of economic relations , etc . 
[ORG China-Iran Energy Cooperation  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Regarding [ORG China-Iran  ] energy cooperation , [PER Cheng  ] believes that there is a “misunderstanding” on the part of the [LOC United States  ] . 
[LOC China  ] has made clear its need for energy resources and has previously stated that its cooperation with [LOC Iran  ] on energy has nothing to do with the [LOC Iran  ] nuclear issue . 
[LOC China  ] hopes that the [ORG U.S. Congress  ] understands this point , said [PER Cheng  ] . 
Specifically , the threat of sanctions against [ORG Sinopec  ] is a very serious issue , [PER Cheng  ] emphasized . 
[ORG Sinopec  ] is very important to [LOC China  ] and [PER Cheng  ] “can’t imagine” the consequences if the company is sanctioned . 
[PER Januzzi  ] noted Cheng’s concerns and said that he would pass this message to [LOC Washington  ] . 
[LOC North Korea  ] ----------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Januzzi  ] recounted his meetings with [ORG DPRK  ] counterparts during his five-day trip to [LOC North Korea  ] and said that he encouraged them to provide a declaration . 
[PER Cheng  ] said that [LOC China  ] does not have specific information on [ORG North Korea’s  ] alleged purchase of centrifuge technology and that [LOC China  ] had received this information from the [LOC United States  ] . 
He urged the [LOC United States  ] to focus on the future and not to dwell on the past . 
The [LOC United States  ] is not interested in delving into [ORG North Korea’s  ] past , [PER Januzzi  ] countered . 
The [LOC United States  ] needs to have clarity on certain issues , however , in order to move forward . 
According to [PER Cheng  ] , [ORG PRC  ] Vice Foreign Minister [PER Wu Dawei  ] urged the [ORG DPRK  ] to take advantage of this unique opportunity . 
The resolution of the declaration issue will require some imagination and creativity , [PER Cheng  ] said . 
[LOC North Korea  ] does not fully trust the [LOC United States  ] and remains concerned about admitting to an activity it claims never existed , [PER Cheng  ] claimed. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) Staffdel [PER Januzzi  ] did not have an opportunity to clear this cable .
