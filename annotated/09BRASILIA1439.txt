( C ) SUMMARY . 
[MISC Brazilians  ] greeted the October 1 announcement that the 2016 Summer [MISC Olympics  ] were awarded to [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] with an outpouring of national pride , a party on [LOC Copacabana  ] beach and a sense of relief that the country is gaining some long overdue recognition as a regional and international leader . 
Politically , the [ORG GOB  ] is looking to capitalize on hosting the games to solidify [LOC Brazil  ] 's image as the leader of [LOC South America  ] and as an emerging global player . 
Internally , the [ORG IOC  ] decision is being portrayed as a validation of President [PER Lula  ] 's administration . 
The [ORG GOB  ] understands that it faces critical challenges in preparing for the 2016 [MISC Games  ] and has shown greater openness in such areas as information sharing to cooperation with the [ORG USG  ] as a result - even going so far as to admit there could be a possibility of terrorist threats . 
The [PER Lula  ] government has taken care to associate [PER Lula  ] 's chosen candidate to succeed him in 2011 , [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] , with the [ORG IOC  ] decision and expects the euphoria engendered by [LOC Rio  ] 's selection to translate into higher poll numbers for Rouseff . 
There remain , however , significant problems , that could impact the success of the [MISC Games  ] , especially in terms of addressing security concerns . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] leadership remains highly sensitive to perceptions of [ORG USG  ] interference and has not begun preparations for international coordination . 
In addition to preparing for the commercial opportunities the games will afford [LOC U.S.  ] businesses , the [ORG USG  ] should look to leverage [MISC Brazilian  ] interest in an [MISC Olympic  ] success to progress in bilateral cooperation in such areas as security and information exchanges . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Amid the celebrations of the October 1 selection of [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] to host the 2016 [MISC Olympics  ] there runs a strong current of relief among [MISC Brazilian  ] leaders . 
President [PER Lula  ] described the feeling as " the end of the street dog complex , " the idea that [LOC Brazil  ] somehow does not deserve the status of an important country . 
[ORG Ministry of External Relations  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) Coordinator for [ORG Sporting Cooperation Vera Alvarez  ] noted that being the first [MISC South American  ] country chosen to host the [MISC Games  ] was seen as evidence that the world ( or at least the [ORG IOC  ] ) recognized [MISC Brazilian  ] primacy on the continent and regional leadership . 
[PER Alvarez  ] also echoed a view expressed commonly in the [MISC Brazilian  ] press: [LOC Rio  ] 's competitors had been [LOC Chicago  ] ( the [LOC United States  ] ) , [ORG Madrid  ] ( the [ORG EU  ] ) and [LOC Tokyo  ] ( the [LOC Pacific Rim  ] ) , and its victory must therefore reflect [LOC Brazil  ] 's perceived comparative success in dealing with the global financial crisis . 
" The [ORG IOC  ] appreciated that we were the first to emerge from the crisis , " she said. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Asked what [LOC Brazil  ] 's goals for hosting the [MISC Games  ] were , [PER Alvarez  ] repeated President [PER Lula  ] 's assertion that these would be the " games of [LOC South America  ] " and said that the [ORG GOB  ] was planning to open its borders to its neighbors to encourage attendance by sports fans from all over the continent . 
Presidential Chief of Staff and likely presidential candidate [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] said the [MISC Games  ] will provide opportunities for a younger generation of [MISC Brazilians  ] and said the government would make numbers of tickets available to the youth of [LOC South America  ] . 
[PER Alvarez  ] likened the effect of hosting the [MISC Games  ] on [LOC Rio  ] to that of the arrival of the [MISC Portuguese  ] court in 1808 , when [LOC Rio  ] went from coastal town to the capital of an empire . 
She then went on to promise that the 2016 games would be the " greenest " [MISC Olympics  ] yet and would improve [LOC Brazil  ] 's international image with their success. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Though [LOC Brazil  ] has some experience with major events such as the [MISC Pan Am Games  ] , the [MISC Olympics  ] will be an unprecedented challenge . 
The great question mark concerning [ORG Rio  ] 's selection has been the security situation , a question brought to the fore on October 17 as a gunfight between drug gangs resulted in the shooting down of a police helicopter ( Ref c ) . 
[ORG MRE  ] contacts have been defensive on security issues , telling [ORG Mission Brazil  ] members ( often without being asked ) that the [ORG IOC  ] clearly did not consider [ORG Rio  ] 's security situation inadequate . 
Apart from the standard [ORG MRE  ] response , however , [ORG GOB  ] officials have shown an understanding that security will be a serious concern for the [MISC Games  ] . 
[ORG MRE  ] political military advisor [MISC Marcos Pinta Gama  ] suggested that the pending General Security of [ORG Military Information Agreement  ] ( [ORG GSOMIA  ] ) could be followed by another arrangement to share security information for the [MISC Olympics  ] . 
[PER Alvarez  ] went so far as to admit that terrorists could target [LOC Brazil  ] because of the [MISC Olympics  ] , a highly unusual statement from a government that officially believes terrorism in [LOC Brazil  ] does not exist . 
The [ORG SENASP  ] ( the [ORG National Secretariat for Public Security , Ministry of Justice  ] ) has been put in charge of security for the [MISC Olympics  ] and will be coordinating the [ORG GOB  ] 's overall on-the-ground security efforts . 
[LOC Rio  ] authorities , meanwhile , expressed confidence in the impact the [ORG Favela Pacification Plan  ] ( Ref d ) will have on the city 's overall security . 
The Plan - which involves evicting drug traffickers , establishing a sustained police presence , and providing basic services to favela residents - envisions the " pacification " of over 100 favela communities by 2016 ( Ref e ) . 
Internal Politics <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Even before the selection of [LOC Rio  ] , the [PER Lula  ] government was hard at work to turn the decision to political advantage . 
[PER Lula  ] 's chosen candidate to succeed him , Chief of Staff [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] , was at his side in [LOC Copenhagen  ] for the selection , an appearance which Sport Minister [PER Orlando Silva  ] declared " will help [PER Dilma  ] 's candidacy . 
" [PER Lula  ] 's highly visible role in lobbying for the [MISC Games  ] is portrayed domestically as international validation of his administration and recognition of [PER Lula  ] as a key world player . 
Indeed , the reality is that much of the actual planning and preparation for [LOC Rio  ] 's bid was done by the [LOC Rio  ] state and municipal governments . 
However , [LOC Rio  ] authorities counted on [PER Lula  ] coming in over the top and providing the international prestige needed to win . 
In a recent meeting , [ORG Rio  ] governor [PER Cabral  ] explained to Consul General in colorful detail [PER Lula  ] 's tireless lobbying efforts in [LOC Copenhagen  ] . 
According to [PER Silva  ] " The opposition will just have to swallow [PER Lula  ] 's leadership . 
" By claiming credit for [LOC Rio  ] 's victory , [PER Lula  ] seeks to bolster his already high approval ratings and then use his popularity to build support for [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] in the October 2010 Presidential election . 
As a first step , the Administration has announced a special [ORG Olympic Program  ] for [ORG Acceleration of Growth  ] ( [ORG PAC  ] ) under [PER Rousseff  ] 's leadership . 
One of [PER Lula  ] 's signature initiatives , the [ORG PAC  ] is a plan to use government resources to leverage private sector investment in infrastructure ( ref a ) . 
While [ORG PAC  ] implementation has been extremely slow , the program has a positive image among [MISC Brazilians  ] , and by putting [PER Rousseff  ] in the lead , [PER Lula  ] helps build her up as the candidate to prepare [LOC Rio  ] for the [MISC Games  ] . 
Comment <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Being awarded the [MISC Olympics  ] is seen as a major victory for [LOC Brazil  ] in what [MISC Brazilians  ] see as a struggle for the recognition they deserve . 
" We are finished being the country of the future and are the country of the present , " [PER Rousseff  ] stated . 
The risk is that the [ORG GOB  ] may choose to rest on its laurels and not get started on the work of planning the [MISC Games  ] - [MISC Games  ] that [PER Lula  ] has already dubbed a great success . 
Despite [PER Rousseff  ] 's affirmation that " we have learned from the [MISC Pan Am Games  ] , " coordination for the 2014 [MISC World Cup  ] , especially on security , lags . 
Attempts by Embassy personnel to establish contact with the [ORG Ministry of Sport  ] have been refused . 
The [ORG GOB  ] has articulated a vision for the [MISC Games  ] - an [MISC Olympiad  ] based on [MISC South American  ] culture , openness to youth and environmentally friendly that played well in terms of domestic politics as well as appealing to the [ORG IOC  ] . 
At this point , however , though state and municipal planning is moving ahead steadily , there has been little practical planning at the federal level for implementation of this grand vision . 
NOTE: [LOC Rio  ] 's challenges in building infrastructure and paying for the [MISC Games  ] will be reported septel . 
For example , to make events more accessible to the [MISC South American  ] public , [PER Lula  ] has said the [ORG GOB  ] will distribute free tickets to the working classes and the youth of the continent . 
[ORG MRE  ] admitted that there had been no thought given to how this would impact on ticket revenue projections or security , or to how the potential flow of youthful spectators across [LOC Brazil  ] 's borders would be managed . 
[LOC Rio  ] also faces a host of challenges building infrastructure and paying for the [MISC Games  ] . 
[PER Lula  ] has similarly decreed that [LOC Brazil  ] will win more medals at the [MISC Rio Games  ] than in the past , but there is no program in place to enhance the development of elite athletes. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [LOC Brazil  ] has shown it can host large-scale events such as the 2007 [MISC Pan Am Games  ] , but the [MISC Olympics  ] will present a different kind of challenge . 
While rejoicing in [LOC Rio  ] 's victory , the current [ORG GOB  ] , with less than a year to go in office , seems to be taking a relaxed approach to preparation . 
The [LOC UK  ] Embassy reports they have had less contact with the [ORG GOB  ] on the [MISC Olympics  ] than we have , even though they are eager to share lessons learned from initial planning for [LOC London  ] 2012 . 
While the very weak [ORG Ministry of Sport  ] currently has the nominal lead on coordinating [MISC Olympic  ] preparations , [ORG Mission  ] anticipates the next Administration may organize preparations differently , perhaps through the [ORG Ministry of Planning or Casa Civil  ] , or even establish a new agency specifically to coordinate [MISC Olympics  ] infrastructure and security planning and logistics . 
Although the police and military have begun planning , the reality may well be that serious efforts await the next government , which will take office January 2011. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Articulating the big picture goals and leaving details to the last minute may be a typically [MISC Brazilian  ] approach , but could lead to problems . 
The delays we expect from the [ORG GOB  ] in planning and executing the preparatory works for a successful [MISC World Cup  ] and [MISC Olympic Games  ] will almost certainly place greater onus on the [ORG USG  ] to ensure that necessary standards are met . 
[ORG Mission Brazil  ] has already begun coordinating among [ORG USG  ] agencies in [LOC Brasilia  ] and [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] , and has begun forward planning for the significant increases in personnel , facilities , and resources that managing [LOC U.S.  ] involvement in the [MISC Games  ] will require . 
Given the high degree of interest in the [MISC Olympics  ] among [MISC Brazilians  ] and the high value [LOC Brazil  ] places on conducting a successful [MISC Games  ] , there are already opportunities for the [ORG USG  ] to pursue cooperation toward the [MISC Games  ] , and to use such cooperation to further broader [ORG USG  ] objectives in [LOC Brazil  ] , including increased cooperation and [MISC Brazilian  ] expertise on counterterrorism activities . 
As we look ahead , taking advantage of the [MISC Games  ] to work security issues should be a priority , as should cooperation on cybercrime and broader information security ( see ref B for additional areas for potential cooperation ) . 
We should also look to build in offers for dialogue on preparations for major sporting events as part of all high-level contacts with the [MISC Brazilians  ] .
