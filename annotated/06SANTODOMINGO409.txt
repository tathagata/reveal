[PER Duvalier  ] , s Return to [LOC Haiti  ] “Unhelpful” - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Kubiske  ] expressed USG concern over a return to [LOC Haiti  ] of either [PER Duvalier  ] or [PER Aristide  ] . 
Both potentially were provocative and could complicate the ability of any new government to establish itself . 
If the election were inconclusive , a return of either one could certainly make things worse . 
We thought that neither should be allowed back into [LOC Haiti  ] until a newly established , functioning democratic government could make a decision itself . 
[PER Kubiske  ] recalled President [PER Fernandez  ] , January 11 conversation with [ORG WHA DAS  ] [PER Patrick Duddy  ] in which [PER Fernandez  ] himself had agreed that [PER Duvalier  ] , s arrival in [LOC Haiti  ] around the time of the elections would be detrimental and that [PER Duvalier  ] should not be permitted to return via the [LOC Dominican Republic  ] ( reftel ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Morales Troncoso  ] agreed that [PER Aristide  ] and [PER Duvalier  ] supporters would get upset if their opponents returned to the scene . 
Anti-Duvalier [MISC Haitians  ] might seek revenge , even after 20 years , he noted . 
He said he had warned the [MISC Dominican  ] embassy in [LOC Port-au-Prince  ] among others against [PER Duvalier  ] coming to or through the [LOC Dominican Republic  ] . 
Reminded by [PER Kubiske  ] about past [MISC Dominican  ] government tolerance of the presence of [MISC Haitian  ] activists on [MISC Dominican  ] soil , [PER Morales Troncoso  ] did not expect [PER Duvalier  ] to live in the [MISC Dominican  ] [LOC Republic.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) For this week , [PER Morales Troncoso  ] said the most important thing is that everyone votes on February 7 and that the vote is legitimate . 
He added , “Anything we can do , we will do , toward this end.” [PER Kubiske  ] suggested that the [MISC Dominican  ] Government make clear that it doesn , t see [PER Duvalier  ] as helpful to [LOC Haiti  ] . 
He strongly agreed: “In fact , unhelpful , ” he replied . 
[PER Kubiske  ] clarified that the message should be that [PER Duvalier  ] was “not welcome” from a [MISC Dominican  ] perspective .

[LOC Washington  ] is also optimistic , though we can never rule out entirely some potential problems , [PER Kubiske  ] noted .

( C ) [PER Morales Troncoso  ] said that the [MISC Dominican  ] Government would be able to work with any of the candidates .

( C ) [PER Morales Troncoso  ] said that the [ORG Core Group  ] on [LOC Haiti  ] , including [ORG OAS  ] Secretary General [PER Insulza  ] , had decided to postpone its meeting here from last week until March 5 . 
The postponement would allow for organizing a more public event and discussing the post-election situation . 
The foreign minister also mentioned a project the [MISC Dominican  ] government had been developing for [MISC Haitian  ] students in the [LOC Dominican Republic  ] . 
He thought the [MISC Dominican  ] government could help [LOC Haiti  ] with education and health .
