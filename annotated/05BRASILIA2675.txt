( C ) Summary . 
Deputy Secretary of State [PER Zoellick  ] , accompanied by Ambassador [PER Danilovich  ] and delegation , met on 6 October with [PER Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] , [ORG International Affairs Advisor  ] to President [PER Lula da Silva  ] . 
[PER Garcia  ] has often served as [PER Lula  ] 's special envoy for crisis situations in the region , and much of the discussion focused on [LOC Bolivia  ] , where the [ORG GOB  ] has tried to use both economic and political influence to enhance stability and press for constitutional solutions . 
The [ORG GOB  ] sees [LOC Bolivia  ] ( as well as [LOC Ecuador  ] and [LOC Peru  ] ) as " fragilized " and views the coming [MISC Bolivian  ] elections , the debate on regionalization and a future constitutional assembly as the key passages that will determine [LOC Bolivia  ] 's future . 
[PER D/S Zoellick  ] urged that the [ORG OAS  ] and [ORG IDB  ] be involved in supporting [LOC Bolivia  ] in weathering those moments and in institution building generally . 
On [LOC Venezuela  ] , [PER Garcia  ] indicated that the [ORG GOB  ] has used its influence with [PER Chavez  ] to successfully insert the " Group of Friends " into a useful role in last year 's referendum , to try to " soften " his anti-American stances , and to mediate between [LOC Colombia  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] during a recent crisis . 
But [PER Garcia  ] would not be drawn into a substantive discussion of [PER Chavez  ] 's repressive internal political actions . 
[PER D/S Zoellick  ] asked that the [ORG USG  ] and [ORG GOB  ] look for ways to place the theme of democratic solidarity in the region at the center stage of the upcoming [MISC Summit of the Americas  ] ( with emphasis on the roles the [ORG OAS  ] and [ORG IDB  ] can play ) . 
On bilateral relations , [PER D/S Zoellick  ] suggested that the [ORG GOB  ] and [ORG USG  ] look for areas where cooperation could be intensified , as it seems ironic that [LOC U.S.  ] relations with [LOC China  ] and [LOC India  ] now seem more dynamic than those with [LOC Brazil  ] , the hemisphere 's other giant democracy . 
[PER Garcia  ] expressed receptivity and said that the [ORG GOB  ] 's guiding principle in its foreign policy is " expanding the space for democracy " in the region and world . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) In a 6 October morning meeting lasting more than an hour at the Presidency 's [LOC Planalto Palace  ] , Deputy Secretary [PER Zoellick  ] and [PER Lula  ] 's senior international advisor , [PER Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] , reviewed a range of regional issues . 
Highlights follow below . 
A delegation list is at paragraph 15 . 
[LOC BOLIVIA  ] ------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Garcia  ] said the [ORG GOB  ] fears the entire [MISC Andean  ] region is " fragilized , " with [LOC Bolivia  ] , [LOC Ecuador  ] and [LOC Peru  ] all facing grave challenges ( [PER Garcia  ] placed [LOC Colombia  ] in a separate category , owing to its internal armed conflict ) . 
Especially in [LOC Ecuador  ] and [LOC Bolivia  ] , weak institutions undermine political comity and stability . 
In [LOC Bolivia  ] , [PER Garcia  ] said enormous social and income inequalities exacerbate a belief in much of the population that the nation has been systematically " looted " of its natural riches ( silver , energy resources ) , and wrongfully denied access to the sea . 
" A certain type of nationalism " stems from these views , affecting the behavior of all political forces in the country , to the detriment of rational discourse on politics , economics and foreign investment , [PER Garcia  ] said. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [LOC Brazil  ] 's approach to trying to assist [LOC Bolivia  ] , [PER Garcia  ] explained , includes deepening its economic presence in the country , seeking to invest heavily in gas , chemical and metallurgical projects that can create employment and attract other foreign investment . 
But these efforts are " paralyzed " in [LOC Bolivia  ] 's insecure environment , a point that [PER Garcia  ] said he and other [ORG GOB  ] envoys regularly stress with [MISC Bolivian  ] interlocutors ranging from [PER Evo Morales  ] to [PER Santa Cruz  ] businessmen . 
With all of these interlocutors the [ORG GOB  ] insists that [MISC Bolivians  ] must seek constitutional resolutions to their country 's political crises , which are both electoral and institutional , [PER Garcia  ] said . 
( He added that President [PER Lula  ] intends to meet the major candidates and personally reinforce this message . 
) But the [ORG GOB  ] doubts that any candidate in the coming presidential candidate will garner close to fifty percent of the vote . 
Hence the congress would again have to select a president , inevitably undermining his legitimacy , especially if the congress' choice is not the largest vote getter . 
For that reason , [PER Garcia  ] expressed some sympathy for the idea of a two-stage referendum. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Despite the challenges , [PER Garcia  ] expressed the [ORG GOB  ] 's belief that the situation in [LOC Bolivia  ] is " unstable but controllable . 
" Noting his emergency visits to [LOC Bolivia  ] as [PER Lula  ] 's envoy during crisis points in 2003 and again this year , [PER Garcia  ] opined that [MISC Bolivians  ] " may approach the edge of the abyss " but always seem to find a way back . 
Whoever emerges as president will quickly perceive the need to build a national consensus for governance , and this will moderate his views , including on the petrochemical questions . 
[PER Garcia  ] said the [ORG GOB  ] reinforces this reality in its conversations with [PER Evo Morales  ] in particular , and the [ORG GOB  ] " has information " that [PER Morales  ] is actually becoming more pragmatic in his outlook as he contemplates the possibility of winning ( which [PER Garcia  ] quickly said the [ORG GOB  ] still sees as uncertain ) . 
[PER Garcia  ] downplayed the importance of foreign actors in [LOC Bolivia  ] , saying that [PER Hugo Chavez  ] and foreign [ORG NGOs  ] may try to exert influence , but the dominant factors in [LOC Bolivia  ] are internal ones . 
[PER Garcia  ] even claimed that [PER Chavez  ] , at [LOC Brazil  ] 's behest , had played a moderating role in convincing [PER Morales  ] and his supporters to soften their positions on legislation on petrochemical industries. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Deputy Secretary [PER Zoellick  ] agreed with the importance of addressing the fragility of institutions in [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
He pointed out the danger of a refusal by parts of the population to accept election results , and in that regard , emphasized the importance of international election observers and an international presence in the election 's aftermath . 
He asked what the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] , the [ORG OAS  ] , and the [ORG IDB  ] could do to build institutions in [LOC Bolivia.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Garcia  ] saw three key passages ahead where international efforts to support [LOC Bolivia  ] could be focused . 
First , the election will set the political context and anticipate the conflicts for the foreseeable future . 
Second , the current debate about regionalization ( including focus on potential models such as [LOC Spain  ] ) will influence events . 
And third , the constitutional assembly will be a bellwether of [LOC Bolivia  ] 's direction , one that is linked closely to the first two . 
If the election and regionalization debate can produce results that contribute to legitimacy , stability and dialogue , then a salutary environment will be set for a constitutional assembly . 
But if the elections and regionalization debate produce greater polarization , the constitutional assembly will be " surreal , " with extremist forces hijacking debate with divisive , exotic and unworkable proposals , [PER Garcia  ] said. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER D/S Zoellick  ] replied that the [ORG USG  ] believes the [ORG OAS  ] could play helpful roles . 
Indeed , the [ORG USG  ] believes now is the time for thinking creatively of how the [ORG OAS  ] and [ORG IDB  ] can be used more effectively in institution-building throughout the region , since democracy is not only about elections , but about institutions that work . 
Observing that he had just come from [LOC Managua  ] , [PER D/S Zoellick  ] pointed to [LOC Nicaragua  ] as a vivid example of the need for political parties that can represent broad constituencies ( [LOC Nicaragua  ] has no center-left party that can counter balance the [LOC Sandinistas  ] , he noted ) , for objective courts , and for tackling corruption. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Garcia  ] said he shared these views on the [ORG OAS  ] , though he said the organization may at times have to operate in a " complex " manner . 
In example , he noted that the [ORG OAS  ] 's ability to engage in [LOC Bolivia  ] during the crisis there earlier this year had been hampered by the fact that the new Secretary General is [MISC Chilean  ] -- a sore point for [MISC Bolivians  ] . 
Instead , [LOC Argentina  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] had sent in envoys ( [PER Garcia  ] was dispatched by [PER Lula  ] ) . 
( [PER Note: Garcia  ] failed to mention that the envoys never reached [LOC Sucre  ] , where the [MISC Bolivian  ] congress was meeting , due to riots in that city . 
End Note . 
) In future in [LOC Bolivia  ] , the [ORG OAS  ] may be able to become involved . 
He also noted [LOC Brazil  ] 's efforts to assist [LOC Ecuador  ] in developing a non-politicized judicial system , and said this is an area in which the [ORG OAS  ] might be especially helpful throughout the region . 
[LOC NICARAGUA  ] --------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Picking up on [PER D/S Zoellick  ] 's comments on [LOC Nicaragua  ] , [PER Garcia  ] said he would visit that country in the near future , and intended to meet with representatives from across the political spectrum . 
He said he would insist in all of his conversations on respect for elections and institutions . 
[PER D/S Zoellick  ] in reply urged [PER Garcia  ] to speak to the [ORG PLC  ] . 
SUMMIT OF THE [LOC AMERICAS  ] ---------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER D/S Zoellick  ] expressed his concern that the declaration for the upcoming Summit of the [ORG Americas  ] ( [ORG SOA  ] ) could become a formulaic document . 
He emphasized that the [ORG SOA  ] should be an important forum for showcasing the potential of the [ORG OAS  ] and [ORG IDB  ] to provide political and economic support for fragile nations in the hemisphere , and for strong democracies to express their solidarity . 
It is important now to create a sense of hope , he added . 
[PER Garcia  ] agreed , and observed that some problems in the [ORG SOA  ] may result in part from " summit fatigue " and a flawed approach that has heads of state signing off on poor declarations at the end of torturous negotiations . 
[LOC VENEZUELA  ] --------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Turning to [LOC Venezuela  ] , [PER Garcia  ] explained that the [ORG GOB  ] has sought to maintain good relations with [LOC Venezuela  ] and play a positive role there . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] vital interests dictate that there must be no " upheaval " in its populous neighbor , because a meltdown in [LOC Venezuela  ] would set a dangerous precedent for regional stability and endanger [LOC Brazil  ] 's economic investments there . 
The [ORG GOB  ] has maintained a dialogue with the opposition in [LOC Venezuela  ] , which has come to see [LOC Brazil  ] as a stabilizing force . 
The [ORG GOB  ] has used its influence with [PER Chavez  ] to bring the " Group of Friends " into the referedum process ( though [PER Chavez  ] initially balked at the group 's composition ) , to mediate between [PER Chavez  ] and [MISC Colombian  ] President [PER Uribe  ] in the recent crisis over [ORG FARC  ] presence in [LOC Venezuela  ] , and to caution [PER Chavez  ] to take a " softer " rhetorical line with regard to the [LOC U.S. Brazil  ] continues to actively pursue joint ventures with [LOC Venezuela  ] in petrol refineries , construction of oil platforms and tanker vessels , and provision of concessions for [MISC Brazilian  ] firms operating in [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
[PER D/S Zoellick  ] asked whether the [ORG GOB  ] is concerned about repressive internal actions by [PER Chavez  ] against opposition elements , [ORG NGOs  ] and the press . 
[PER Garcia  ] demurred on a clear response , saying only that the [ORG GOB  ] is taking a " wait and see " approach to the internal political scene and that the [MISC Venezuelan  ] press appears to continue to be outspoken in its attacks on [PER Chavez  ] . 
BILATERAL RELATIONS ------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) In considering [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] relations , [PER D/S Zoellick  ] said he wanted to " plant some seeds " with the [ORG GOB  ] . 
Noting that he had recently returned from a bilateral strategic dialogue in [LOC China  ] and that the [LOC U.S.  ] relationship with [LOC India  ] is also evolving , [PER D/S Zoellick  ] said he had found himself thinking of [LOC Brazil  ] and finding it ironic that there is not a similar movement toward broader horizons in the [LOC U.S.  ] relationship with [LOC Brazil  ] , the other giant democracy in the western hemisphere . 
[PER D/S Zoellick  ] suggested that the [ORG USG  ] and [ORG GOB  ] should consider new ways for working together in initiatives on democracy building , development and assistance projects and cooperation in science and technology , health and the environment . 
He also suggested more frequent contact at the ministerial level in finance and other areas beyond the traditional realm of foreign ministries. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Ambassador Abednur endorsed this approach and noted his own contacts with a range of ministries in [LOC Brasilia  ] to energize cooperation in several areas . 
[PER Garcia  ] also agreed , saying the [ORG GOB  ] would welcome concrete initiatives to deepen relations between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] . 
He criticized [MISC Brazilian  ] pundits who have frequently charged that the [PER Lula  ] administration 's foreign policy ignores or antagonizes the [LOC U.S.  ] for ideological reasons . 
[PER Garcia  ] opined that , while [LOC Brazil  ] 's is a government of the left , it does not allow ideology to influence its " realistic " approach to the world . 
The [ORG GOB  ] 's guiding interest is " expanding the space for democracy " throughout the world , starting in this hemisphere . 
[PER Garcia  ] further observed that personal ties are important to [PER Lula  ] , and that the friendship he enjoys with Presidents [PER Bush  ] positively colors the bilateral relationship , as does the good relations between FM [ORG Amorim  ] and [PER D/S Zoellick  ] , and Finance Minister [PER Palocci  ] and [ORG Treasury Secretary Snow  ] . 
Such relationships " are not accidental " and are reflective of the many things that the two countries have in common , [PER Garcia  ] added. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 .
