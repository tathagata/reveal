End Summary . 
[PER Colom  ] to Sign [ORG PetroCaribe  ] Deal ------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) During his July 8 farewell call on President [PER Alvaro Colom  ] and Foreign Minister [PER Haroldo Rodas  ] , the Ambassador inquired about President [PER Colom  ] 's planned July 13-14 trip to [LOC Caracas  ] to sign a [ORG PetroCaribe  ] agreement with [LOC Venezuela  ] ( ref a ) . 
President [PER Colom  ] confirmed his travel plans , and defended his decision . 
He said he was surprised that the [MISC Guatemalan  ] countryside had not yet " exploded " in protest at recent increases in fuel and food prices , and expressed concern that a popular backlash might not be long in coming . 
Food and fuel inflation was straining people 's budgets , resulting in increased pressure on the state 's limited social welfare net . 
[PER Colom  ] added that [ORG Congress  ] was unlikely to approve his proposed tax reform plan , so expected increases in state revenues would not be realized . 
[ORG PetroCaribe  ] offered attractive financing terms , and would free up considerable funds for social welfare programs . 
Just a month ago , [ORG PetroCaribe  ] negotiations had ground to halt , [PER Colom  ] said , but changing economic conditions had required the [ORG GOG  ] to reconsider . 
[PER Colom  ] said he had discussed [ORG PetroCaribe  ] with [MISC Dominican  ] President [PER Fernandez  ] , who had encouraged [LOC Guatemala  ] 's adhesion. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Foreign Minister [PER Rodas  ] added that the decision to join [ORG PetroCaribe  ] was strictly economic . 
The [ORG GOV  ] had pressed the [ORG GOG  ] to join the [MISC Venezuelan-led  ] [ORG ALBA  ] anti-American trade block , but the [ORG GOG  ] wanted no part of it , and would not accede to any [MISC Venezuelan  ] political conditions . 
" We're Social [MISC Democrats  ] , but we're not fanatics , and we're aware that radicalism in governance leads to failure , " [PER Colom  ] said. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) ( Note: FRG Congresswoman [PER Zury Rios  ] separately told the Ambassador that she believed the [ORG PetroCaribe  ] deal , which requires congressional approval , would easily pass [ORG Congress  ] given the current inflationary environment . 
She also predicted [PER Colom  ] 's tax reform proposal would fail . 
" [LOC Guatemala  ] Bench " Congresswoman [PER Rosa Maria Frade  ] also told us that [ORG PetroCaribe  ] would pass , and opined that savings realized from a [ORG PetroCaribe  ] deal might compensate the loss of anticipated revenues from the fiscal reform package . 
End Note . 
) Review of [ORG Senior Officials' Performance  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) President [PER Colom  ] lamented the recent deaths in a helicopter accident of Minister of Government [PER Vinicio Gomez  ] and Vice Minister [PER Edgar Hernandez Umana  ] ( ref b ) . 
[PER Colom  ] expressed confidence that newly appointed Minister [PER Francisco Jimenez  ] would continue [PER Gomez  ] 's efforts to reform the police ( ref c ) . 
Regarding Attorney General [PER Juan Luis Florido  ] , [PER Colom  ] Q ( ref c ) . 
Regarding Attorney General [PER Juan Luis Florido  ] , [PER Colom  ] said [PER Florido  ] is amicable and is making a sincere effort . 
Nonetheless , he expressed frustration at the Attorney General 's Office 's seeming inability to progress with certain kinds of prosecutions , such as corruption , the murders of two union leaders , and the recent scandal over the illicit investment of congressional funds ( ref d ) . 
[PER Colom  ] said that Commissioner [PER Carlos Castresana  ] of the [ORG International Commission Against Impunity  ] in [LOC Guatemala  ] ( [ORG CICIG  ] ) is very demanding , and that under his leadership , [ORG CICIG  ] is making some progress in helping the Attorney General 's Office to put its house in order. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The Ambassador asked about Environment Minister [PER Luis Ferrate  ] , noting that [PER Ferrate  ] 's indiscreet public declarations at times gave potential investors second thoughts . 
[PER Colom  ] agreed that [PER Ferrate  ] should be more measured in his public statements , and noted that he had regular , sharp disagreements with other cabinet members , especially Minister of Energy and Mines [PER Carlos Meany  ] . 
[PER Menchu  ] Inciting Indigenous Communities -------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Regarding the investment climate , the Ambassador raised the June 21 incident in which indigenous protesters opposed to the construction of a cement plant killed a community leader who had favored the project ( septel ) . 
[PER Colom  ] said that former presidential candidate and [MISC Nobel Peace Prize  ] [PER Laureate Rigoberta Menchu  ] was at least partly responsible for inciting local opposition to the proposed plant . 
She had told [PER Colom  ] of her involvement and that she would continue to encourage indigenous people to protect their land . 
[PER Colom  ] said he had responded by saying that encouraging indigenous people to protect their land was acceptable , but that killing was not and that the [ORG GOG  ] would act to enforce the law. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Colom  ] said [PER Menchu  ] was a " fabrication " of [MISC French  ] anthropologist and author [PER Elizabeth Burgos  ] , who wrote the book , " I , [PER Rigoberta Menchu  ] , " that brought [PER Menchu  ] to international attention . 
[PER Colom  ] said that [PER Menchu  ] is widely disliked by [MISC Guatemalan  ] indigenous people , as demonstrated by her poor showing in the 2007 presidential election . 
He said he was present at a 1997 ceremony at which [MISC Mayan  ] leaders formally pardoned [PER Menchu  ] for " betraying her people . 
" Observing that [PER Menchu  ] was unfit for the presidency , [PER Colom  ] said he had advised her against running , saying she should not risk sullying her reputation in politics . 
Regarding the polemics about the circumstances in which [PER Menchu  ] learned [MISC Spanish  ] , [PER Colom  ] said he knew the truth -- his older sister [PER Yolanda  ] , while a guerrilla leader , taught [PER Menchu  ] " up in the mountains . 
" [PER Colom  ] said his venerable indigenous " teacher " had once commented to him that " no indigenous person would ever be president of [LOC Guatemala  ] " due to the deep rifts among [LOC Guatemala  ] 's 22 [MISC Mayan  ] indigenous groups . 
Comment ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) President [PER Colom  ] took this opportunity to reiterate the high priority he places on good relations with the [LOC United States  ] , and was concerned about the [ORG USG  ] 's potential reaction to the [ORG PetroCaribe  ] deal . 
With year-on-year inflation now at 13.5% , and inflation of the basic basket of consumer goods at 22% , [PER Colom  ] has reason to be concerned by the potential for popular backlash against rising prices . 
We agree with our several interlocutors' assessment that , in the current inflationary environment , [ORG Congress  ] will likely approve the [ORG PetroCaribe  ] deal , and that it will not approve tax reform .
