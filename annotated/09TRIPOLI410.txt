Cretz  ] , Ambassador . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) [MISC Chadian  ] Ambassador [PER Daoussa Deby  ] called on the Ambassador on May 14 to provide an update on recent fighting in eastern [LOC Chad  ] and denounce [LOC Sudan  ] 's recurring efforts to destabilize his country . 
[PER Deby  ] said his government had " no problem with [LOC Sudan  ] " , but was instead a victim of problems in [LOC Darfur  ] . 
Nonetheless , [PER Deby  ] complained that [LOC Sudan  ] had repeatedly reneged on its commitment to peace negotiations in [LOC Tripoli  ] , [LOC Dakar  ] , [LOC Khartoum  ] , and [LOC Doha  ] , adding that [LOC Libya  ] could " do nothing " with a government that was unwilling to fulfill its obligations . 
Citing [LOC Khartoum  ] 's swift violation of the core principles of the February 17 [LOC Doha  ] agreement between the [ORG GOS  ] and [ORG JEM  ] , he noted that [LOC Sudan  ] 's willingness to violate accords extended beyond bilateral agreements , . 
2 . 
( C ) [PER Deby  ] reported that [LOC Chad  ] was very satisfied with the [ORG USG  ] position and support of the recent [MISC PRST  ] condemning [ORG UFR  ] attacks and [ORG GOS  ] support for the rebels . 
He said the [ORG UFR  ] invaded with over 800 trucks and that fighting was ongoing , but that [LOC Chad  ] 's armed forces had captured fighters , vehicles , weapons , and " many documents " from the rebels . 
While he characterized [LOC Libya  ] 's position on the [MISC PRST  ] as " unfriendly " , he said relations between [LOC Chad  ] and [LOC Libya  ] were still normal and that President [PER Idriss Deby  ] and [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] had a close relationship . 
[LOC Chad  ] deferred to [LOC Libya  ] 's desire to move the May 28-30 CEN-SAD summit to the [MISC Libyan  ] town of [LOC Sirte  ] , and supported [LOC Libya  ] 's efforts to move the July 1-3 AU Summit to the same location . 
3 . 
( C ) Comment and bio note: [PER Deby  ] spoke largely in general terms and stuck to points already delivered to [LOC Embassy N'Djamena  ] . 
He mentioned that al-Qadhafi 's chief of staff , [PER Bashir Saleh  ] , helped manage [LOC Libya  ] 's relationship with various rebel groups , but did not discuss his own relationship with [ORG JEM  ] 's [LOC Tripoli  ] representative , [PER Suliman Abdalla Ismael  ] . 
[PER Deby  ] said he had been in [LOC Tripoli  ] only 10 days since presenting his credentials . 
While he did not request specific support , [PER Deby  ] spent much of the meeting recounting how he had previously represented [LOC Chad  ] as their Ambassador to [LOC Libya  ] from 1997-2003 . 
Claiming a weak facility with [MISC English  ] , he conducted most of the meeting in [MISC French  ] . 
His ability to speak and understand [MISC Arabic  ] seemed advanced . 
End comment and bio note .
