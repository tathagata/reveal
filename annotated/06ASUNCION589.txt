( U ) This is an action request ; see para 10. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) SUMMARY: The [ORG USD  ] 155K that post received in [LOC FY-2004  ] has played an important role in helping [LOC Paraguay  ] combat its TIP problem , particularly in the areas of prevention and protection . 
However , post anticipates these funds running out by the end of 2006 . 
Working closely with [LOC U.S.  ] experts and [MISC GOP  ] officials , we have identified concrete requirements to strengthen [LOC Paraguay  ] 's ability to combat trafficking in the coming year . 
As part of a bilateral assistance project between the Embassy of the [LOC United States  ] in [LOC Asuncion  ] and the Government of [LOC Paraguay  ] ( [MISC GOP  ] ) , the [ORG USG  ] conducted a study of [LOC Paraguay  ] , s system of immigration and border controls between July 23 through August 5 , 2005 , with a view to offering recommendations to the [MISC GOP  ] that would assist it in combating the problem of trafficking in persons ( TIP ) by improving border controls . 
A team of [ORG Department of Homeland Security  ] ( [ORG DHS  ] ) officials led the assessment . 
The [ORG DHS Team  ] included agents from [ORG Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ] ( [ORG ICE  ] ) and [ORG Customs  ] and [ORG Border Protection  ] ( [ORG CBP  ] ) . 
Post requests an allocation of [ORG USD  ] 310,000 in [MISC FY-2006  ] [ORG INL  ] funds consistent with the [ORG DHS Team  ] 's recommendations and consultation with [MISC GOP  ] officials to continue assisting the [MISC GOP  ] in combating TIP . 
End Summary. -------------- The Assessment -------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) [LOC Paraguay  ] is a source country for trafficked women and children , many of whom are smuggled across [LOC Paraguay  ] 's borders into the neighboring countries of [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Argentina  ] . 
[LOC Paraguay  ] 's [ORG Department of Immigration  ] is aware of the TIP problem and acknowledges the [MISC GOP  ] must improve its border controls in order to prevent traffickers from transporting victims across its borders. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) During the assessment , the team spoke with several [ORG Ministry and Secretariat  ] officials in [LOC Asuncion  ] , including the [ORG Ministries of Foreign Affairs  ] , [ORG Customs  ] , and [ORG Interior ( Immigration Department  ] ) , the [ORG Secretariats of Women , Repatriations  ] , and Children and Adolescents . 
They also spoke to the [ORG Inter-American Development Bank  ] and non-governmental organizations ( [ORG NGOs  ] ) such as [PER Grupo Luna Nueva  ] , a local recovery center for victims . 
The team visited several land border inspection stations including [LOC Ciudad del Este  ] , [LOC Encarnacion  ] , [PER Pedro Juan Caballero  ] and [ORG Puerto Falcon  ] . 
They also inspected the [PER Silvio Pettirossi International Airport  ] in [LOC Asuncion.  ] ------------------------- More Money , Fewer Problems ------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) The assessment report has been reviewed by all the stakeholders within AMEmbassy [LOC Asuncion  ] and was translated into [MISC Spanish  ] and provided to our [MISC GOP  ] counterparts . 
The next phase of this project is to take action on the recommendations made by the [ORG Team.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) In order to build on advances made by the [MISC GOP  ] , Post has identified several areas that will assist the [MISC GOP  ] better in its efforts to combat TIP . 
Our focus in the coming year is to expand training for officials , investigators , prosecutors and judges ; assist the [MISC GOP  ] to expand rehabilitation center services in government run shelters ; enhance border controls ; and establish and maintain a victim database to provide better services to the victims of TIP and prosecute perpetrators . 
However , the [MISC GOP  ] will require outside funds to meet essential program requirements. ---------- Prevention ---------- 7 . 
( U ) Prevention represents the weakest link in [MISC GOP  ] efforts to combat trafficking . 
The [MISC GOP  ] has taken some positive steps that we have supported - information pamphlets and radio spots along with a hotline -- but funding and prevention programs remain weak . 
Post recommends continued funding support for the [ORG Ministry of Womens Affairs  ] outreach programs to prevent trafficking as well as the following: -- The [ORG DHS  ] team recommends holding an annual border control symposium in [LOC Asuncion  ] with the participation of all border control agencies . 
A symposium will provide the opportunity for agency administrators to clearly communicate the mission of the individual border control agencies , establish a national strategy as well as coordinate a unified border enforcement effort . 
In addition , this symposium would address the concerns heard by the [ORG DHS  ] officers of many border control front line officials regarding a concern relating to a " disconnect " between [LOC Asuncion  ] and frontline border crossing offices . 
Post would fund the first border patrol symposium . 
-- The [ORG DHS  ] team recommends that a supervisory level [ORG U.S. Customs and Border Protection  ] Officer be detailed to [LOC Paraguay  ] for a 30-60 day period to provide advisory assistance at the various ports of entry to assist [MISC Paraguayan  ] officials in implementing administrative and procedural changes . 
The Team feels that [MISC Paraguayan  ] border control officials are capable of performing their duties but lack the proper training and guidance . 
A short-term advisor could assist in teaching them to conduct interviews , searches , observation techniques , etc . 
-- The [ORG DHS  ] team recommends that selected [MISC Paraguayan  ] officials with direct supervisory responsibilities at [MISC Paraguayan  ] ports of entry be given the opportunity to travel to the [LOC U.S.  ] and observe first-hand [LOC U.S.  ] border management techniques and functions at specific [LOC U.S.  ] ports of entry. ---------- Protection ---------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) The [MISC GOP  ] has made some strides in providing support and protection to victims but resources are few . 
The [ORG Ministry of Repatriations  ] seeks corporate funds to repatriate victims because the [MISC GOP  ] cannot support adequately the ministries operations . 
In addition , the [ORG Ministry of Women 's Affairs  ] has ambitious plans to establish a shelter to provide victims a place to reside while in [LOC Asuncion  ] once they are repatriated . 
Again , the lack of [MISC GOP  ] resources has prevented the ministry from establishing a 50 bed facility . 
At this time , a [MISC Catholic  ] monastry is providing beds to the [ORG Ministry of Women 's Affairs  ] . 
Usually the victims remain in [LOC Asuncion  ] for approximately 2 or 3 months while they are receiving legal , medical , psychological and rehabilitative services . 
Once the women leave [LOC Asuncion  ] , there is no follow-up or support program to assist victims in returning to their home town . 
Last year , post provided funds to assist the [ORG Women 's Ministry  ] in creating a rehabilitation center that provides trafficked women with services including psychological and job counseling . 
Post recommends identifying funds to support the establishment of a more permanent shelter to protect victims and assist them in making the transition to stability as well as efforts to expand [MISC GOP  ] support for victims in the interior of the country.</pre></code>
