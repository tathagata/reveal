( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Government of [LOC Libya  ] ( [ORG GOL  ] ) does not maintain diplomatic relations with [LOC Israel  ] . 
Local firms are required by national law to comply with the boycott , and would therefore not be able to sign the required [LOC U.S.  ] certification without exposing themselves to civil and/or criminal penalties . 
Post accordingly requests a waiver of of the [ORG Arab League  ] boycott certification . 
2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Post continues to raise the [ORG Arab League  ] boycott issue in its meetings with the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] and the [ORG Ministry of Economy and Trade  ] . 
Most recently , in the fall , the [MISC Charge'  ] pressed the [ORG MFA  ] 's Secretary for the [ORG Americas  ] on the issue , noting that [LOC AL  ] boycott language in [MISC Libyan  ] contracts would undermine [ORG GOL  ] efforts to attract [LOC U.S.  ] business . 
The [ORG MFA  ] official replied that the [ORG GOL  ] and private entities are compelled by [MISC Libyan  ] law stemming from the [LOC AL  ] resolution to include language requiring compliance with the [LOC AL  ] boycott 3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Ministry of Trade and Economy  ] informed Post that the [ORG GOL  ] does not enforce the boycott . 
While this may be [ORG GOL  ] policy , as a practical matter boycott language continues to appear in contract language , and is sometimes enforced , sometimes not . 
As detailed ref C , for example , a [LOC U.S.  ] company was presented with a draft contract by [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG National Procurement Authority  ] ( [ORG NPA  ] ) containing language requiring the company to acknowledge that it observed a comprehensive boycott of [LOC Israel  ] . 
The language was expansive , barring any business contact with or investment in [LOC Israel  ] , and requiring the [LOC U.S.  ] company to abide by all laws and decisions related to the [LOC AL  ] 's boycott action . 
Representatives of the [LOC U.S.  ] company refused to sign the contract ; the [ORG NPA  ] subsequently removed the boycott-related language in its entirety . 
To reinforce the decision and avoid potential misunderstanding , the parties agreed on and signed an [MISC English-only  ] iteration of the contract . 
In an additional example , two [MISC German  ] firms were reportedly asked to sign letters attesting that they were in compliance with the anti-Israel boycott as a pre-condition for securing required [ORG GOL  ] stamps on export documents from the [MISC Libyan  ] People 's [MISC Bureau  ] in [LOC Berlin  ] ( [MISC Libyan  ] Embassy-equivalent ) .
