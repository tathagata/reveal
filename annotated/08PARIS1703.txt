[PER Sarkozy  ] Spells it Out for [PER Bashar  ] al-Asad ---------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) President [PER Sarkozy  ] , during his September 3-4 visit to [LOC Damascus  ] , delivered a frank message to his [MISC Syrian  ] counterpart [PER Bashar al-Asad  ] , according to [PER Boris Boillon  ] ( the [LOC Middle East  ] Counselor at the [LOC Elysee  ] ) . 
Per [PER Boillon  ] , [PER Sarkozy  ] told al-Asad that in order to build a relationship of trust with [LOC France  ] , [LOC Syria  ] would need to respect its commitments ( e.g. , normalizing relations with [LOC Lebanon  ] ) and respect certain non-negotiable principles ( e.g. , [LOC Lebanon  ] 's sovereignty and the inviolability of the [ORG International Tribunal  ] on the [PER Hariri  ] assassination ) . 
Moreover , [PER Sarkozy  ] noted that [LOC France  ] would be watching closely to see whether [LOC Syria  ] attained certain benchmarks by the end of the year , namely: the exchange of ambassadors with [LOC Lebanon  ] ( the most critical benchmark in [PER Boillon  ] 's opinion ) ; the modification of the [ORG Syria-Lebanon High Council  ] ; and the restoration of three defunct commissions to discuss refugees , borders , and to review existing treaties . 
Al-Asad reaffirmed his previous commitment to [PER Sarkozy  ] to exchange ambassadors with [LOC Lebanon  ] before the end of the year , and to make progress on the other issues . 
[PER Boillon  ] stressed that [PER Sarkozy  ] remained " pragmatic " about [LOC Damascus  ] and would make a dispassionate decision at year 's end on whether the [MISC Syrians  ] had attained the benchmarks and , consequently , where to take the relationship . 
He would not be swayed by pecuniary concerns in dealing with what [LOC France  ] sees as an unimportant trading partner . 
( " They are nothing for us , " scoffed [PER Boillon  ] , who observed that [LOC Syria  ] froze trading opportunities in 2007 and [LOC France  ] was now 61 in the ranks of [MISC Syrian  ] trading partners . 
He acknowledged that several business leaders , including the CEO of Total and a wealthy [MISC Syrian-origin  ] entrepreneur , had been on the trip . 
He also confirmed exploratory talks on the sale of 14 [ORG Airbus  ] aircraft to [LOC Syria  ] and said that [LOC U.S.  ] components would pose problems for such a sale , but added it was a commercial deal that the [ORG GOF  ] was not actively pushing ) . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] 's view remains that if the [MISC Syrians  ] do not perform , then " tant pis " ( too bad for them ) said [PER Boillon  ] , who conceded that the [LOC Elysee  ] has not yet given much thought as to where it would like to take the relationship if the [MISC Syrians  ] pass muster . 
[PER Boillon  ] noted that FM [PER Kouchner  ] will likely see FM Muallim in November at a follow-on meeting for the [ORG Mediterranean Union  ] , which will give the [MISC French  ] an opportunity to signal to the [MISC Syrians  ] whether they are on track for a passing grade in December , which might result in a second , longer visit by [PER Sarkozy  ] to [ORG Damascus.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Noting that [PER Sarkozy  ] also pressed al-Asad on [LOC Israel  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , and human rights , [PER Boillon  ] assessed that [PER Bashar  ] has been weakened by the assassination of [PER Mohammed Suleiman  ] and would [LOC PARIS  ] 00001703 002 OF 003 himself be " finished " if he were to publicly acknowledge [LOC Israel  ] 's successful attack on [LOC Syria  ] 's nuclear research facility , an attack to which the [MISC Syrians  ] made no effective riposte . 
Al-Asad professed to be concerned by the delay in the next round of indirect [MISC Syrian-Israeli  ] peace talks and , in response to a query from [PER Sarkozy  ] , claimed to have no objection to indirect peace talks between [LOC Lebanon  ] and [LOC Israel  ] that might proceed in tandem with the [MISC Syrian-Israeli  ] track . 
However , al-Asad claimed that the [MISC Lebanese  ] themselves were not prepared to take such a step . 
[PER Boillon  ] claimed that [PER Sarkozy  ] had made some progress in shaping al-Asad 's thinking on the [LOC Iran  ] nuclear question by asking how the latter could be confident that [LOC Tehran  ] 's nuclear program is for civilian use in the absence of international inspection . 
( Unfortunately , [PER Sarkozy  ] did not use this moment of epiphany to suggest that al-Asad also re-think [LOC Syria  ] 's candidacy for a seat on the [ORG IAEA Board of Governors  ] . 
) [ORG Human Rights ------------  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [MISC Syrians  ] , clearly anticipating [PER Sarkozy  ] 's talking points on human rights , adroitly deflected the brunt of his message by suggesting that [LOC France  ] channel future human rights demands ( e.g. , lists of prisoners to be released ) through [LOC Qatar  ] so as " to avoid the optic of [LOC Syria  ] caving into [MISC Western  ] pressure . 
" The [MISC French  ] seem to have swallowed this specious argument , although [PER Boillon  ] claimed that there was a " favorable evolution " in al-Asad 's position on the case of kidnapped [MISC Franco-Israeli  ] soldier [PER Gilad Shalit: Bashar  ] , although he declined to deliver a letter from [PER Shalit  ] 's father to [ORG Hamas Political Bureau  ] chief [PER Khalid Mishal  ] , agreed to speak to [PER Mishal  ] and encourage him to see that the letter is delivered on humanitarian grounds . 
The [MISC French  ] believe that al-Asad fulfilled this commitment. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Boillon  ] dismissed the September 4 quad meeting of [PER Sarkozy  ] , al-Asad , [MISC Turkish  ] PM [PER Erdogan  ] , and [MISC Qatari  ] [ORG Emir  ] al-Thani as a largely academic exchange of views , with little meaningful discussion ( although he observed that al-Asad and [PER Erdogan  ] were each surprisingly well-informed about [LOC Darfur  ] ) . 
He also reported that on the margins of the visit , [MISC Syrian  ] FM Muallim had told the [MISC French  ] delegation that [LOC Syria  ] could do without an [ORG EU  ] association agreement if the alternative was the conditionality outlined in the letter he received a few weeks ago from his [MISC Spanish  ] , [MISC German  ] and [MISC Italian  ] counterparts . 
The significance of Muallim 's statement , in [PER Boillon  ] 's view , is that the [MISC Israelis  ] have yet to realize that the prospect of an [ORG EU  ] association agreement is not a significant incentive for [LOC Damascus  ] . 
[ORG MEPP/Saudi Initiative  ] for [LOC Lebanon  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Turning to other regional issues , [PER Boillon  ] distanced [PER Sarkozy  ] from a set of ideas that the MFA had hoped to present at the September 6 Gymnich working lunch on how the [ORG EU  ] could play a more active role in supporting the [LOC Middle East  ] peace process ; [PER Boillon  ] acknowledged that they reflect ideas [PER Sarkozy  ] has supported , but characterized them as " reflections " that did not represent a new initiative on the part of [LOC France  ] . 
On [LOC Lebanon  ] , [PER Boillon  ] said that notwithstanding the somewhat gloomy reporting from the [MISC French  ] embassy in [LOC Beirut  ] , he believed the overall situation in the country was relatively good at the moment . 
He described President [PER Sleiman  ] as " very , very cautious -- and that 's putting it diplomatically , " whereas he saw [PER Michel Aoun  ] as " an enigma who nevertheless represents many [MISC Lebanese  ] Christians -- we don't have much contact with him , perhaps wrongly . 
" [PER Boillon  ] expressed concern about funding from the [LOC Gulf  ] states for [MISC Salafist  ] groups in and around [LOC Tripoli  ] , noting that a former [MISC Lebanese  ] Prime Minister had recently walked him through the reason the Salafists abrogated an agreement with [ORG Hizballah  ] the day after signing it ( the reason , said [PER Boillon  ] , is that one branch of the [MISC Salafist  ] clan funded by [MISC Kuwaitis  ] had been over-ruled by another branch funded by [MISC Saudis  ] ) . 
On a related note , [PER Boillon  ] confided that last week he met with a " personal envoy " ( NFI ) from [MISC Saudi  ] King [PER Abdallah  ] , who outlined an initiative to provide up to USD $1 billion dollars in support to [MISC Lebanese  ] [MISC Sunni  ] groups for use in the upcoming parliamentary elections and for defense " against [ORG Hizballah  ] . 
" " If that is the [MISC Saudi  ] vision for [LOC Lebanon  ] , that is truly worrisome , " said [PER Boillon  ] , who was simultaneously arranging a meeting for visiting [MISC Saudi  ] Foreign Minister [PER Saud al-Faisal  ] , who was in [LOC France  ] on September 9 on an unannounced visit to his [ORG Parisian  ] residence . 
Comment [LOC PARIS  ] 00001703 003 OF 003 ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Comment: [PER Boillon  ] is an engaging and enthusiastic interlocutor whose personal loyalty to [PER Sarkozy  ] is palpable . 
We believe his readout to be largely accurate , although we are somewhat skeptical of [PER Bashar  ] 's alleged epiphany on the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear program , and somewhat dismayed that the [MISC Syrians  ] seem to have so easily deflected the [MISC French  ] president on the question of human rights . 
As for the benchmarks , we believe the [ORG Elysee  ] is sincere in its desire to hold the [MISC Syrians  ] to objective performance benchmarks , yet we remain concerned that even if [LOC Syria  ] 's performance falls short , [PER Sarkozy  ] may find it politically difficult to shelve one of his self-proclaimed foreign policy successes . 
This suggests that rather than trying to derail [LOC France  ] 's rapprochement with [LOC Syria  ] -- a train that has already left the station -- our goal should be to maintain a continual , candid dialogue with the [ORG Elysee  ] on [LOC Syria  ] 's behavior with an eye towards informing their year-end policy review . 
Finally , we defer to our colleagues at [LOC Embassy Riyadh  ] on the question of [MISC Saudi  ] financial support for [LOC Lebanon  ] 's [MISC Sunni  ] community ; we report [PER Boillon  ] 's comments here merely to register the [ORG Elysee  ] 's concern on that score .
