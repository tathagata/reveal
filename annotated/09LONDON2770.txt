<code><pre>UNCLAS [LOC LONDON  ] 002770 SIPDIS EO 12958 N/A TAGS ELAB , [LOC ECON  ] , [ORG UK SUBJECT: UNION LEADER: CONSERVATIVE  ] VICTORY NO DISASTER <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC UK’s  ] trade unions are preparing for the possibility of a [MISC Conservative  ] government , but are not yet ready to predict a certain and convincing [MISC Tory  ] victory , [PER Brendan Barber  ] , head of the [ORG Trades Union Congress  ] ( [ORG TUC  ] ) told the Ambassador during a December 9 meeting . 
Noting that recent polls showed a narrowing of the [ORG Conservatives’  ] lead , [PER Barber  ] said that voters were fatigued with the entire political process , and [PER David Cameron  ] has been unconvincing in demonstrating that he was the best person to lead the [LOC UK.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) If the [MISC Tories  ] were to win , trade unions do not expect a return to the [MISC Thatcherite  ] days of hostility to labor , when she called unions the “enemies from within , ” stated [PER Barber  ] . 
[PER Cameron  ] , in contrast , has publicly stated that he wanted a sensible relation with the unions , that he did not have an anti-union basis . 
[PER Barber  ] stated that the [MISC Tories  ] have actually been “courting” the unions a bit , because they know they would need union support in any effort to reduce public sector employment as a deficit-fighting measure . 
If the election were to result in a hung parliament , the union movement might actually be in the strongest political position , since all three parties would need its support , stated [PER Barber  ] . 
He predicted a small [MISC Conservative  ] majority as the most likely outcome of the election. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) When asked whether he thought elections would be called in March , rather than May , as has been rumored in some circles , [PER Barber  ] viewed this as highly unlikely . 
The [ORG Labour  ] government will announce its budget in March , and will want to use that budget to draw a clear dividing line between its policies and those of the [MISC Conservatives  ] . 
With the economy starting to show signs of recovery , [ORG Labour  ] would also want a few more months of positive news before calling the elections. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Background on [PER Barber  ] and the [ORG Trades Union Congress  ] . 
[PER Barber  ] is General Secretary of the [ORG TUC  ] , with 58 affiliated unions representing approximately seven million members , many of whom work in the public sector . 
[PER Barber  ] acknowledged that membership has “taken a dive” this year , primarily because of the private and public sector layoffs . 
While there is no formal link between the [ORG TUC  ] and the [ORG Labour Party  ] , fifteen trade unions are affiliated to the [ORG Labour Party  ] , and provide a major share of [MISC Labour’s  ] funding , amounting to [MISC GBP  ] 3.2 million , 73 percent of overall funding , in the second quarter of 2009 .
