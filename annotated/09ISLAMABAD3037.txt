Patterson  ] , for reasons 1.4 ( b ) ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary: [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , who has been designated by [ORG UN  ] High Commissioner for Refugees [PER Antonio Guterres  ] as [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] in [LOC Pakistan  ] , met with the Ambassador and Deputy Chief of Mission on December 13 to discuss the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Government’s  ] position on the possible movement of [MISC Baloch  ] leader [PER Brahmdagh Bugti  ] from [LOC Afghanistan  ] to a country of asylum . 
He requested [LOC U.S.  ] intervention with [MISC Pakistani  ] authorities if [ORG UNHCR  ] agrees to facilitate this movement . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] Brahmdagh’s uncle , reportedly told [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that the Government of [LOC Ireland  ] has agreed to offer asylum to [PER Bugti  ] , although [ORG UNHCR  ] has not yet confirmed this offer . 
At the request of [ORG UNHCR  ] , the Ambassador agreed to engage President [PER Zardari  ] and have the [MISC Embassy  ] follow up with [ORG Inter-Services Intelligence  ] ( [ORG ISI  ] ) to ensure that the [ORG GOP  ] would not act against such a transfer or negatively respond to UNHCR’s potential involvement . 
In a subsequent conversation , however , [ORG DGI ISI Pasha  ] registered to [ORG COS  ] the [LOC Pakistan  ] military’s opposition to allowing [PER Bugti  ] to obtain refugee status . 
While getting [PER Bugti  ] out of [LOC Afghanistan  ] is still a good idea , we do not believe [ORG UNHCR  ] should be involved . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] met recently with [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , who sought [ORG UNHCR  ] support in facilitating the movement out of [LOC Afghanistan  ] of [PER Brahmdagh Bugti  ] , [PER Nawab Akbar Khan  ] Bugti’s grandson and head of the [ORG Baloch Republican Party  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] reportedly told [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that the Government of [LOC Ireland  ] was willing to receive [PER Brahmdagh Bugti  ] , who “had to get out of [LOC Afghanistan  ] and would not be safe returning to [MISC Pakistan.”  ] [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also contended that the [ORG USG  ] would be supportive of this transfer . 
( Note: [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] has met with [MISC Embassy  ] poloffs several times to float the idea of moving [PER Bugti  ] , sharing with us that Ireland’s Deputy Prime Minister is willing to help [PER Bugti  ] gain asylum there . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] sought a meeting on December 13 with the Ambassador to discuss the [ORG USG  ] position on the potential transfer of [PER Bugti  ] , although [ORG UNHCR  ] has yet to verify Ireland’s willingness to receive him or to make a determination as to whether [PER Bugti  ] is eligible for refugee status . 
The [ORG British Government  ] has previously refused to consider asylum for [PER Bugti  ] . 
According to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , while [ORG UNHCR  ] believes that moving [PER Bugti  ] from [LOC Afghanistan  ] and from close proximity to and influence in [LOC Baloch  ] insurgent activity in [LOC Pakistan  ] would be in the [MISC Pakistani  ] [ORG Government’s  ] interest , High Commissioner [PER Guterres  ] is concerned that UNHCR’s potential involvement in this transfer could have a negative impact on UNHCR’s humanitarian access , operations , and security in [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[ORG UNHCR  ] is seeking assurances that the [MISC Pakistani  ] Government will not act against such a transfer or penalize UNHCR’s potential involvement in it . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told the Ambassador that his meeting with [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and all UNHCR’s interaction with [MISC Baloch  ] leaders have been carefully monitored by [MISC Pakistani  ] intelligence. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG UNHCR  ] will hold an in-house meeting to be attended by [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] to discuss more generally what to do with regard to the [LOC Baloch  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Besides [PER Bugti  ] , there are “a few hundred” [LOC Baloch  ] in [LOC Kandahar  ] ( largely from [PER Dera Bugti  ] ) , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] explained . 
He said that recognizing these [LOC Baloch  ] as refugees would be well received by the [MISC Pakistani  ] [LOC Baloch  ] community - which believes [ORG UNHCR  ] has been insufficiently supportive of them despite [LOC Baloch  ] assistance in facilitating the release of kidnapped [ORG UNHCR  ] Quetta Sub-Office Head [PER John Solecki  ] -- but would not be well-received by the Government of [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
ISLAMABAD 00003037 002 OF 002 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The Ambassador told [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that the [ORG USG  ] would be supportive of moving [PER Bugti  ] out of the region but said that [ORG UNHCR  ] would need to confirm first Ireland’s willingness to grant him asylum . 
She and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] both expressed concern about the possible implications of [LOC XXXXXXXXXXXX’s  ] stipulation that [PER Bugti  ] would need to be able to freely travel outside his country of asylum . 
The Ambassador agreed to engage President [PER Zardari  ] and have the [MISC Embassy  ] follow up with [ORG Inter-Services Intelligence  ] ( [ORG ISI  ] ) to ensure that the [ORG GOP  ] would not act against a transfer of [PER Bugti  ] out of [LOC Afghanistan  ] or negatively respond to UNHCR’s potential involvement. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In a subsequent conversation , <em>DG [ORG ISI Pasha  ] told [ORG COS  ] that he believed [PER Bugti  ] should return to [LOC Pakistan  ] to stand trial for his crimes . 
While declaring that the decision belonged ultimately to the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] , he made clear that the [LOC Pakistan  ] military would not favor allowing [PER Bugti  ] to be accorded refugee status . 
It was also clear from [MISC Pasha’s  ] comments that efforts on the part of [ORG UN  ] agencies to effect [PER Bugti  ] being provided with asylum in [LOC Europe  ] would color the [LOC Pakistan  ] military’s perception of those agencies and would affect their working relationships.</em> <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Comment: On  ] the basis of [MISC Pasha’s  ] remarks , we are advising [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that it would be better for [ORG UNHCR  ] not to pursue this initiative with [PER Bugti  ] .
