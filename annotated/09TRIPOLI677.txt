ELDER QADHAFI QUIETLY LISTENS 6 . 
( C ) [MISC Libyan  ] leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] , who joined the group in the same tent in which [PER Muatassim  ] had met the CODEL , likewise highlighted the strength of the [MISC U.S.-Libya  ] relationship . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] commented that friendship was better for the people of both countries and expressed his desire to see the relationship flourish .

[PER Qadhafi  ] remained quiet throughout the discussion and did not respond specifically to any of the issues with the exception of [MISC Megrahi  ] ( ref A ) .

[ORG COMMENT  ] 7 . 
( C ) CODEL [PER McCain  ] 's meetings with [PER Muammar  ] and [PER Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi were positive , highlighting the progress that has been made in the bilateral relationship . 
The meetings also reiterated [LOC Libya  ] 's desire for enhanced security cooperation , increased assistance in the procurement of defense equipment , and resolution to the [MISC C130s  ] issue . 
Although [PER Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi repeated [LOC Libya  ] 's familiar complaint that it has not received enough recognition and support in exchange for its decision to abandon its WMD programs , [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi was notably silent on this issue . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] 's silence on these issues may have been part of his reaction to the [ORG CODEL  ] 's discussion of the pending release of convicted [MISC Pan Am 103  ] bomber [PER Abdel Basset  ] al-Megrahi ( ref A ) , an issue that reportedly is of great personal concern to [PER Qadhafi  ] . 
[ORG BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE  ] 8 . 
( C ) Senior [MISC Libyan  ] officials confided that the [ORG CODEL  ] 's meeting with [PER Qadhafi  ] took place so late in the evening ( nearly 11 pm ) because the Leader had been fasting and usually takes a nap after breaking his fast . 
The [MISC Libyan  ] officials told us that [PER Qadhafi  ] often fasts on Mondays and Thursdays and is doing so now , in the run up to the holy month of [LOC Ramadan  ] . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] appeared as if he had been roused from a deep slumber for the meeting . 
He showed up with rumpled hair and puffy eyes , and was casually dressed in a short-sleeved shirt patterned with the continent of [LOC Africa  ] , wrinkled pants and slip-on shoes . 
In spite of his appearance , [PER Qadhafi  ] was lucid and engaged throughout the meeting . 
[PER Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi , on the other hand , revealed his lack of strategic depth throughout the meeting , referring to " the 52 countries of [LOC America  ] -- or is that [LOC Africa  ] ? 
" and asking [ORG MFA  ] officials to clarlify [LOC Libya  ] 's role in the upcoming [ORG UN General Assembly  ] . 
9 . 
( C ) [PER Muatassim  ] conducted his meeting in [MISC English  ] , while his father used an interpreter for his meeting . 
The elder [PER Qadhafi  ] appeared to understand some of the [ORG CODEL  ] 's English-language remarks and offered a few comments in [MISC English  ] . 
10 . 
( U ) [PER CODEL McCain  ] did not have the opportunity to clear this message prior to departure .
