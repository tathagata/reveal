Lead Stories Summary Print media focused primarily on two issues: President [PER Obama  ] 's decision to give up the missile defense program involving [LOC Poland  ] and the [LOC Czech Republic  ] , and the school attack in the [MISC Franconian  ] city of [LOC Ansbach  ] . 
Some papers also foregrounded the election campaign , which is moving into its final days . 
Editorials focused on President [PER Obama  ] 's decision to give up the missile defense plan and the school attack . 
[ORG ZDF-TV  ] 's early evening newscast heute opened with a live report from [LOC Ansbach  ] , while [ORG ARD-TV  ] 's early evening newscast [ORG Tagesschau  ] opened with reports on the missile defense. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC U.S  ] . 
) Missile Defense All media prominently reported that " President [PER Obama  ] has put a stop to the plans of his predecessor , [PER Bush  ] , to deploy a missile defense shield in [LOC Eastern Europe  ] . 
He explained this by saying that there are new facts on the threat [LOC Iran  ] poses " ( [ORG ARD-TV  ] 's primetime newscast [ORG Tagesschau  ] ) . 
Many media described [PER Obama  ] 's " U-turn " as an attempt to get [MISC Russian  ] support for [ORG UN  ] measures against [LOC Iran  ] . 
Although most editorials welcomed the decision , it also met with some skepticism . 
Front-page headlines included: " [PER Obama  ] puts a stop to the missile defense shield in [LOC Poland  ] and the [LOC Czech Republic  ] " ( [ORG Berliner Zeitung  ] 9/18 ) ) , " [LOC U.S.  ] puts stop to missile defense shield in [LOC Eastern Europe  ] " ( S|ddeutsche ) , " [PER Obama  ] gives up [PER Bush  ] 's missile defense shield in [LOC Europe  ] " ( [ORG Die Welt  ] ) , " [PER Obama  ] chooses a 'flexible' missile defense " ( [ORG Frankfurter Allgemeine  ] ) , and " [PER Obama  ] declares peace to [LOC Russia  ] " ( [ORG FT Deutschland  ] ) . 
Primetime [ORG ARD-TV  ] 's [ORG Tagesschau  ] ( 9/17 ) commented: " Although there might be new threat assessments and technological progress , President [PER Obama  ] wants to remove a large diplomatic stumbling block... . 
[PER Obama  ] hopes that [LOC Moscow  ] will make concessions in connection with [LOC Iran  ] and nuclear disarmament . 
" [PER Westdeutscher Rundfunk  ] ( 9/17 ) radio commented: The renouncement of the missile defense system in [LOC Poland  ] and the [LOC Czech Republic  ] does not just come as a relief for [LOC Central Europe  ] and [LOC Russia  ] , but lets the entire world believe in disarmament again... . 
Once again , [LOC Washington  ] 's change towards reason demonstrates once more that [PER Bush  ] 's policy was dangerous for the world . 
The view forward makes us hopeful . 
Only together with [LOC Moscow  ] , we can persuade [LOC Tehran  ] to make reliable concessions to prevent the production of nuclear weapons once and for all without ruling out the peaceful usage of nuclear energy... . 
[PER Obama  ] 's decision strengthens those within and outside [ORG NATO  ] who believe in disarmament . 
What remains is the disappointment of [MISC Polish  ] and [MISC Czech  ] politicians who had hoped to increase their countries' security through the missile defense shield . 
These backward thinking people should now consider the possibility that they will particularly benefit from [LOC Washington  ] 's improved relations with [LOC Moscow  ] . 
" Deutschlandfunk radio ( 9/17 ) commented: " [PER Obama  ] believes that solo runs within [ORG NATO  ] are counterproductive . 
For the current [LOC U.S.  ] government , [LOC Russia  ] is an indispensible partner in the [ORG UN Security Council  ] . 
However , this is not given as a reason because [PER Obama  ] wants to prevent the impression that he bowed to vehement [MISC Russian  ] resistance to the original missile defense plans... . 
If this decision is interpreted as a weakness , then this is another price [LOC BERLIN  ] 00001158 002 OF 004 [LOC Washington  ] has to pay for its misguided policies in recent years . 
" [ORG ARD-TV  ] late night newscast Tagesthemen ( 9/17 ) remarked: " This is realpolitik . 
[PER Reagan  ] and [PER Bush  ] 's [ORG Star Wars  ] dreams were ideologically motivated and therefore did not consider costs and dangers . 
[PER Obama  ] is practical , even when he looks at his budget . 
In addition , no [LOC U.S.  ] President makes such concessions without getting something in return . 
We might already see next week when the [ORG UN Security Council  ] responds to [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear policy what kind of concessions [LOC Russia  ] makes . 
[PER Obama  ] will head the meeting and needs a success . 
And , as a great hope from whom many still expect the impossible , he needs success . 
" S|ddeutsche Zeitung ( 9/18 ) opined: " [PER Obama  ] 's greatest challenge will be that he must remove the suspicion that he bowed to [LOC Russia  ] . 
He must not just do this in [ORG Congress  ] but also in [LOC Eastern Europe  ] , where people fear that [LOC Moscow  ] could see the renouncement of the missile defense shield as a sign of weakness that encourages the [MISC Russians  ] to pursue their interests elsewhere with tanks , like in [LOC Georgia  ] . 
However , [PER Obama  ] will have many opportunities to show that the missile defense shield is not the yardstick for [ORG NATO  ] 's loyalty to the [MISC Poles  ] and [MISC Czechs...  ] . 
[ORG NATO  ] could do maneuvers in the countries and if necessary set up bases there . 
[ORG NATO  ] 's new strategy should also take the fears of eastern [MISC Europeans  ] into account... . 
[PER Obama  ] will have difficulty implementing his cooperative foreign policy if [LOC Europe  ] as a whole does not support him . 
" [ORG Die Welt  ] ( 9/18 ) commented on its front-page: " One thing was certain in the past: [LOC America  ] 's Presidents come and go - but their foreign policies remain the same... . 
[PER Obama  ] is entering a new path and the direction is getting clearer.. . 
As expected , the [LOC U.S.  ] government is saying goodbye to [PER George W. Bush  ] 's plan to establish a missile defense shield in [LOC Central Europe  ] . 
The reason is practical and fundamental.. . 
It is a further signal that [PER Obama  ] is pursuing a policy on [LOC Iran  ] that is based on building confidence . 
And it fits in his ambitious project to create a world without nuclear weapons . 
It must be seriously asked whether this policy isn't naove and dangerous , also because disappointment is spreading in [LOC Central Europe  ] . 
" Under the headline " U-turn , " [ORG Frankfurter Allgemeine  ] ( 9/18 ) said in a front-page commentary: " There is no doubt that the decision has an enormous impact on foreign and security policy , not to speak of the style of communicating it [ to [LOC Poland  ] and the [LOC Czech Republic  ] ] . 
It will have an effect on the potential countries where it was supposed to be deployed . 
They had to take a lot of unpleasant criticism from their western neighbors , threats from [LOC Russia  ] and skepticism among their own people when the topic of missile defense was hot under [PER Bush  ] . 
In the future when the next controversial topic is debated , they will think twice whether they should move so closely to the [LOC U.S.  ] and take such risks . 
" [ORG Frankfurter Rundschau  ] ( 9/18 ) remarked: " [LOC Russia  ] is a partner that the [LOC U.S.  ] cannot ignore . 
Until the end of the year , both countries have to agree on renewing the START treaty if they want to avoid a new arms race . 
[MISC Russian  ] President [PER Medvedev  ] has made clear what the price is: the [LOC U.S.  ] must renounce the missile defense shield , return to the [MISC ABM  ] treaty that builds mutual confidence and renounces missile defense systems . 
[LOC Iran  ] seems to be playing only on the regional level . 
The renouncing of missile defense is not just a tactical move . 
It is a change of course . 
The leaders in [LOC Moscow  ] should not be under the illusion that their toughness has paid off . 
However , [MISC Europeans  ] can hope that [LOC Washington  ] 's current understanding for bearing global responsibility will continue .

( [LOC Afghanistan  ] ) Aftermath of Elections Many papers carried factual news reports on the events in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , but the majority of them focused on the aftermath of [LOC BERLIN  ] 00001158 003 OF 004 the airstrike near [LOC Kunduz  ] and the elections and , in reports on the [PER Karzai  ] government 's reaction to allegations of election fraud , mentioned that six [MISC Italian  ] soldiers died in a suicide attack in [LOC Kabul  ] . 
[ORG Frankfurter Allgemeine  ] ( 9/18 ) headlined on its front page: " Many People killed in Attack on [MISC ISAF Soldiers  ] in [LOC Kabul  ] . 
" In another report FAZ ( 9/18 ) wrote that " the death of six [MISC Italian  ] soldiers of a unit based in [LOC Siena  ] in a suicide attack in [LOC Kabul  ] has caused a shock in [LOC Italy  ] but has , for the time being , not resulted in a new debate over the [ [MISC Italian  ] ] mission in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
" [ORG Tagesspiegel  ] ( 9/18 ) headlined: " 16 people Killed in Attack in [LOC Kabul  ] - Six [MISC Italian Soldiers Die  ] , " and wrote: " This was the thus far most serious attack on the [MISC Italian  ] forces in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[LOC Italy  ] has sent 2,800 soldiers to the [ORG ISAF  ] forces in the country . 
As of Thursday , 20 [MISC Italian  ] soldiers have lost their lives in the mission . 
" Sueddeutsche Zeitung ( 9/18 ) reported under the headline: " Serious Attack In [LOC Kabul  ] - Six [MISC Italian Soldiers Dead  ] - [PER Karzai Defends  ] Elections " that " In [LOC Italy  ] , the death of the soldiers caused a shock and a new political debate over the [MISC Italian  ] military engagement in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
" Editorial commentary , however , focused on the outcome of the presidential elections . 
[ORG Die Welt  ] ( 9/18 ) demands: " Recount ! 
Now , " and judged: " In [LOC Berlin  ] , the question of whether the re-election of [MISC Afghan  ] President [PER Karzai  ] is credible or fraudulent has major domestic political significance . 
The question is not whether [LOC Afghanistan  ] is ripe for democracy or whether a certain degree of corruption...is acceptable . 
The question is whether a fraudulent majority for [PER Karzai  ] offers the [ORG Taliban  ] a lever to present themselves on the international stage as the political opposition against a corrupt regime and then get rid of the description 'terrorists.' 
If the [ORG Taliban  ] are trying to be recognized as a party in the civil war and are able to refer to a fraudulent election , the government in [LOC Berlin  ] could no longer use the argument that the [MISC Bundeswehr  ] presence in [LOC Afghanistan  ] as a 's tabilization mission , ' not a 'war.' 
[PER Hamid Karzai  ] rejected the allegation that one quarter of the votes was falsified . 
The [MISC West  ] must now examine this in the same resolute way as it did in [LOC Pakistan  ] in 2008 after former ruler [PER Musharraf  ] suspended the parliamentary elections . 
If the [MISC West  ] uses different yardsticks for [PER Karzai  ] than it used for [PER Musharraf  ] , the [ORG Taliban  ] supporters will expand their assistance . 
And then it is only a small step to the foundation of a 'National Liberation Front' with which the [ORG Taliban  ] could legitimize themselves internationally . 
That is why all votes should be recounted and , if necessary , new elections be held . 
" According to [ORG Frankfurter Allgemeine  ] ( 9/18 ) , " people easily talked about a 's uccess' after the [MISC Afghan  ] presidential elections...but the degree of egregious vote-rigging , which is now gradually coming to the fore , is surprising . 
What is even worse President [PER Karzai  ] is left looking like the main sinner . 
The international community that is supporting his government with financial means and supports him with 100,000 soldiers who are risking their lives for the country 's survival on a daily basis is faced with a dilemma . 
It cannot continue to support him but cannot drop him either . 
The best way out is to give the election results the greatest possible legitimacy by reviewing them , if necessary also with a runoff election , even if it takes place early next year . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC Lebanon  ] ) Formation of [ORG New Government  ] In an editorial Sueddeutsche ( 9/18 ) said: " The surprising thing about [LOC Lebanon  ] is that life continues there even without a government . 
For more than three months now , the parties are unable to agree on a coalition . 
One reason is that the possible coalition parties recklessly pursue their own political and economic interests . 
Second , the neighboring states and the major powers are also involved in [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
The opposition parties led by [ORG Hezbollah  ] tend to look to [LOC Iran  ] , which wants to enter into talks with the [LOC United States  ] at the beginning of October . 
The [MISC Saudis  ] and with them the [MISC Americans  ] are strengthening prime minister-designate [PER Hariri  ] and [LOC BERLIN  ] 00001158 004 OF 004 his team because [LOC Tehran  ] 's influence is to be contained in [LOC Lebanon  ] , too . 
But these are not favorable prospects for an early agreement .
