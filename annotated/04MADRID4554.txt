( C ) Summary . 
[LOC Spain  ] is among the most important foreign investors in [LOC Cuba  ] and the ruling Socialist party has continued the [ORG Popular Party  ] 's policy of encouraging further investment and trade with [LOC Cuba  ] . 
On human rights issues , the [ORG GOS  ] has broken with the [MISC Aznar  ] administration 's emphasis on support for democracy activists in favor of seeking greater dialogue with the [PER Castro  ] regime . 
Within the [ORG EU  ] , [LOC Spain  ] has led the effort to end the [ORG EU  ] policy of inviting dissidents to [ORG EU  ] national day events , calling the invitations a major impediment to normal contact with the [MISC Cuban  ] authorities . 
Despite our displeasure over the direction of [MISC Spanish  ] policy towards [LOC Cuba  ] , we should consider whether it is in our interest to deepen our divisions with the [ORG EU  ] over [LOC Cuba  ] by authorizing [ORG Title III  ] actions against [MISC Spanish  ] entities , given [ORG EU  ] countries' tendency to defer to [LOC Spain  ] on [LOC Cuba  ] issues . 
[ORG Madrid  ] considers itself a bridge between [LOC Cuba  ] and the [ORG EU  ] and has emphasized this purported role to overcome the objections of countries that insist on a strong , principled [ORG EU  ] position on [LOC Cuba  ] . 
Even [ORG EU  ] countries that have resisted [MISC Spanish  ] efforts to weaken [ORG EU  ] positions on [LOC Cuba  ] may feel compelled to support an [ORG EU  ] partner faced with [LOC U.S.  ] legal action . 
End Summary. //SPAIN SEEKS TO EASE [ORG EU  ] " RESTRICTIVE MEASURES " ON CUBA// <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) As a member of the [ORG EU  ] , [LOC Spain  ] is a party to the [ORG EU  ] [MISC Common Position  ] on [LOC Cuba  ] , which guides [ORG EU  ] diplomatic relations with [LOC Cuba  ] and links improved bilateral relations to an improvement in [LOC Cuba  ] 's human rights record . 
[MISC Spanish  ] officials have repeatedly stated their commitment to the [MISC Common Position  ] . 
However , over the last six months , and in particular since September , the [ORG GOS  ] officials have emphasized their rejection of [MISC Aznar  ] 's activism on behalf of [MISC Cuban  ] opposition figures and have advocated the " modification " of the [ORG EU  ] 's " Restrictive Measures " against [LOC Cuba  ] . 
[ORG Madrid  ] 's primary objective is to end the policy of inviting [MISC Cuban  ] opposition figures to [ORG EU  ] national day celebrations , which the [ORG GOS  ] cites as the main obstacle to normal diplomatic ties . 
The [ORG GOS  ] asserts that normal diplomatic relations would enable the [ORG GOS  ] to positively influence [MISC Cuban  ] officials and would not preclude robust relations with dissidents. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) We strongly disagree with [ORG GOS  ] efforts to weaken the [ORG EU  ] Restrictive Measures and believe we should do whatever possible to block [ORG Madrid  ] 's initiative within the [ORG EU  ] . 
[MISC Spanish  ] officials have responded to our criticism of their actions on the Restrictive Measures by stating their intention to promote continued , and even increased contacts with [MISC Cuban  ] opposition figures . 
In public statements on [LOC Cuba  ] , both President [PER Zapatero  ] and FM Moratinos have stressed the need for the [ORG GOC  ] to institute democratic reforms as a precondition for greater support for [LOC Cuba  ] by the [ORG EU  ] . 
[LOC Spain  ] 's latitude on [LOC Cuba  ] is hemmed in by [ORG EU  ] partners , such as the [LOC Czech Republic  ] , that reject weakening [ORG EU  ] measures and instead support a strong , principled stand in support of pro-democracy activists . 
This political landscape would probably shift to our disadvantage in the event of legal action against a [MISC Spanish  ] company under [ORG Title III.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Regardless of the government in power , [LOC Spain  ] plays a leading role on [LOC Cuba  ] issues within the [ORG EU  ] . 
Under [MISC Aznar  ] , [LOC Spain  ] was a key player in solidifying [ORG EU  ] support for a strong , principled defense of human rights issues ( even as his government pursued continued [MISC Spanish  ] investment in [LOC Cuba  ] and opposed the [LOC U.S.  ] embargo ) . 
With the shift in [LOC Spain  ] 's [LOC Cuba  ] policy under [PER Zapatero  ] , we still see [ORG EU  ] countries deferring to [LOC Spain  ] on [LOC Cuba  ] policy , though this time in a negative direction . 
The [ORG GOS  ] understands its leverage on [LOC Cuba  ] within the [ORG EU  ] and , if [ORG Title III  ] action were taken against a [MISC Spanish  ] company , it would seek to rally its [ORG EU  ] partners to its defense , and perhaps even undermine broader [ORG EU  ] support for the [MISC Common Position  ] . 
[LOC Countries  ] that have resisted [ORG Madrid  ] 's attempts to water down [ORG EU  ] policy towards [LOC Cuba  ] could feel undermined by a USG decision to permit legal action against [MISC Spanish  ] companies. //MAJOR [MISC SPANISH  ] INVESTMENTS IN CUBA// <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 .
