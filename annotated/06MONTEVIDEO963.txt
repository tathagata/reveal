( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary and Introduction: [LOC Uruguay  ] 's ongoing debate over the teaching of history and a recent public shouting match between the sons of important actors during [LOC Uruguay  ] 's dictatorship both illustrate the importance of that period to modern politics and policy in [LOC Uruguay  ] . 
The complex history of the dictatorship created heroes and villains for both the left and right . 
Some of the persons involved are still active in politics , and the real and imagined lessons from the period continue to inform modern politicians . 
[LOC Uruguay  ] is only now devising a curriculum through which to teach this subject in its history classes , but sensitivities may still run too hot to effectively complete the project . 
A contentious debate between the son of the slain opposition congressman [PER Zelmar Michelini  ] and the son of [PER Juan Bordaberry  ] who was president at the beginning of the dictatorship , grabbed national attention October 4 . 
Although the dictatorship ended more than 20 years ago , its conflicts are still unresolved in the public mind , and the policies of key factions of the governing [MISC Frente Amplio  ] coalition continue to reflect a strong reaction to this period . 
End Summary and Introduction . 
RECAP: CAUSES AND DOWNFALL OF URUGUAY'S DICTATORSHIP --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) In the late 1960s , a long accumulation of deteriorating political and economic factors produced severe social and labor unrest and the rise of the [ORG National Liberation Movement  ] - [ORG Tupamaros  ] ( [ORG MLN-T  ] ) , a guerrilla group that began a campaign of urban terrorism . 
These conditions gradually ushered in a process of steadily increasing military involvement in the country 's political life . 
Initially , the police were charged with suppressing the insurgency , but proved unable to stem the escalating wave of kidnappings , bombings , and assassinations . 
Successive [ORG Colorado Party  ] Presidents [PER Jorge Pacheco  ] ( 1967-72 ) and [PER Juan Bordaberry  ] ( 1972-76 ) resorted to states of siege that permitted the military to act in the name of " national security " with scant regard for civil liberties and laws . 
During this period [ORG Tupamaros  ] kidnapped three [MISC American  ] embassy employees , including [PER Dan Mitrione  ] who , in 1971 , was killed by the [ORG Tupamaros  ] and later slandered in leftist circles as a " [ORG CIA  ] torturer . 
" In September 1971 , President [PER Pacheco  ] called on the military to take primary responsibility for the fight against the [ORG Tupamaros  ] . 
The armed forces were well equipped for the task and virtually wiped out the insurgency within a matter of months. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) However , once engaged , the military viewed its mandate as one to re-establish internal order at all costs and embarked on a campaign to purge the country of " undesirable leftists , opposition and union elements . 
" Constitutional safeguards , suspended during the declaration of " internal war , " were prolonged by new legislation that put draconian controls on the media and on dissent . 
The new laws also by-passed normal legal protections and allowed for persons charged with crimes against national security to be detained and subject to trial in military courts . 
In June 1973 , the military forced then-President [PER Bordaberry  ] to suspend the democratic process and accept military rule through a [ORG National Security Council  ] ( [ORG COSENA  ] ) composed of senior military officers and the ministers of [LOC Defense  ] , [LOC Interior  ] , and Foreign Affairs. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) During the early and mid-dictatorship period , the military moved brutally against anyone it deemed as a threat to national security . 
An estimated 6,000 citizens were tried in military courts , and human rights groups charged that tens of thousands had been detained , denied legal rights , or were tortured . 
Some 300,000-400,000 [MISC Uruguayans  ] reportedly fled into exile , and in some instances became victims of the security forces in neighboring countries . 
The number of [LOC Uruguay  ] 's " disappeared " persons during the " dirty war " is estimated by some at around 150 with at least 28 confirmed dead . 
The statistics , however , remain in dispute . 
In 1980 under intense international pressure including from the [LOC U.S.  ] , military officials conducted a referendum to legitimize their rule through constitutional reform . 
The referendum failed , and negotiations began for a return to democracy . 
In 1984 the " [ORG Naval Club  ] Pact " -- a political agreement between the armed forces and four political parties paved the way for the military to exit power. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) In 1985 the military finally relinquished power following the election of [PER Julio Maria Sanguinetti  ] in October <a id='par1984' href='#par1984'>¶</a>1984 . 
A blanket amnesty was granted to the [ORG Tupamaros  ] and other opponents of the regime . 
But in the transition from a military dictatorship to a democracy , [LOC Uruguay  ] still faced the dilemma of having to decide between prosecuting military officers for crimes committed under the period of military rule ( and risk a military revolt ) or granting them an amnesty . 
In December 1986 , [ORG Congress  ] approved the [ORG Expiration Law  ] ( " Ley de [MISC Caducidad  ] " ) that granted amnesty to members of the military and police for acts committed prior to March 1 , <a id='par1985' href='#par1985'>¶</a>1985 . 
Seen as an " impunity law " by its critics , the controversial measure was put to a public referendum on April 16 , 1989 when citizens voted 57 percent in favor of keeping the law in effect . 
Successive governments of [PER Luis Alberto Lacalle  ] , [PER Sanguinetti  ] ( second administration ) and [PER Jorge Batlle  ] did relatively little to re-open investigations of human rights abuse cases , with the exception of [PER Batlle  ] 's " [ORG Peace Commission  ] " that was established to compile facts and helped him gain greater popularity . 
On March 1 , 2005 [PER Tabare Vazquez  ] took office and promised to pursue human rights issues , declaring , " We are not hostages to the past , but [MISC Uruguayan  ] society needs to know what happened so that it never happens again . 
" USES AND ABUSES OF HISTORY -------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Uruguay  ] 's national curriculum committee ( [ORG ANEP  ] ) continues to generate strong debate as it seeks to include the period of the [MISC Uruguayan  ] dictatorship in the nation 's history curriculum . 
Several sources believe the [ORG MPP  ] , part of the [ORG FA  ] coalition government and led by several former [MISC Tupamaro  ] guerrillas , is behind the new interest in " recent history . 
" In their eyes , the history of the period begins with the allegedly harsh police response to the visit of [PER Ernesto  ] " Che " [PER Guevara  ] in 1961 when one of [PER Guevara  ] 's associates was killed by a militant right-wing activist . 
In hindsight they portray their movement as a defense of civil liberties . 
A former military officer of the era remembered the history differently and told us that civilians regularly acted as informants and applauded as police arrested [ORG Tupamaros  ] . 
The [ORG Blanco Party  ] hopes the new curriculum will honor one of its elder statesmen , [PER Wilson Ferreira Aldunate  ] , for what they believe was his key role in the end of the dictatorship . 
One of the historians working on the curriculum created a huge stir in September when he stated his " personal belief " that pressure from the [LOC United States  ] was the primary cause of the end of the dictatorship . 
The depth of feeling over the issue on all sides demonstrates its hold on society , and may indefinitely delay agreement on the curriculum. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) On a television talk show October 4 , [PER Pedro Bordaberry  ] , son of former-President [PER Juan Bordaberry  ] , described his ongoing attempts to clear his father 's name . 
During the broadcast , [ORG FA  ] Senator [PER Rafael Michelini  ] appeared in the studio and was granted permission to speak . 
On air , he accused the former president of complicity in the killing of [PER Zelmar Michelini  ] in [LOC Buenos Aires  ] during the dictatorship . 
The senior [PER Michelini  ] , [PER Rafael  ] 's father , was a vocal member of the banned opposition . 
In response , [PER Bordaberry  ] 's son , [PER Pedro  ] , called [PER Michelini  ] " a liar " and played audio tapes of [PER Michelini  ] and another [ORG FA  ] politician stating that they did not blame former-President [PER Bordaberry  ] for the crime . 
The acrimony between two sons searching for closure shows the emotional intensity still connected to the period , and the front-page coverage by major newspapers of the debate illustrates the continuing breadth of interest in [LOC Uruguay  ] . 
MODERN IMPACT ------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Despite the [ORG GOU  ] 's general engagement with the [LOC U.S.  ] , some elements of the left distrust the [LOC US  ] and fear connection with a nation they believe supported the dictatorship . 
In mantra-like fashion , union leaders , [MISC Communists  ] , the [ORG MPP  ] , and hard-core Socialists regularly disparage the [LOC U.S.  ] in terms identical to those used during the [MISC Cold War  ] , and loudly grumble about cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] But while the vocal few often do not hold real power , their lingering prejudices have a chilling effect on some aspects of [MISC US/GOU  ] relations . 
Since the [ORG FA  ] came to power , no [ORG GOU  ] representatives have attended [MISC Trafficking  ] in [MISC Persons  ] or biotechnology seminars sponsored by the [ORG Embassy  ] . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] has limited access to several ministries controlled by far-left ministers . 
And more than 18 months after the beginning of the [ORG FA  ] government , some bureaucrats work hard to avoid meeting USG representatives . 
The [PER Vazquez  ] administration must contend with virulent objections from within the [ORG FA  ] in his quest to improve trade ties with the [LOC U.S.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Memories of the dictatorship also affect [ORG FA  ] policy toward the military and police . 
The [ORG GOU  ] has kept a tight reign on military and police budgets despite a crumbling military capability and increasing crime . 
In addition [PER Vazquez  ] ordered the military in 2005 to allow forensic experts to search for the remains of the " disappeared " on select military bases . 
After personally ramming [LOC Uruguay  ] 's participation in the [ORG UNITAS  ] naval exercise with the [LOC U.S.  ] through Parliament in 2005 , President [PER Vazquez  ] cancelled [MISC Uruguayan  ] participation in 2006 . 
He remains open to [ORG UNITAS  ] pending the results of an ongoing review of [LOC Uruguay  ] 's defense structure , and pending an [MISC Uruguayan  ] request to make [ORG UNITAS  ] more relevant to [LOC Uruguay  ] 's defense needs . 
( [PER Note: Although  ] the armed forces quickly crushed the [ORG Tupamaros  ] in 1971 , a small remnant of dedicated [MISC Communist  ] insurgents remained active far longer . 
This explains why many of the disappeared [MISC Uruguayans  ] were [MISC Communists  ] rather than [ORG Tupamaros  ] . 
In 1986 , President [PER Julio Maria Sanguinetti  ] reportedly entered into a tacit agreement with the [MISC Communists  ] to get them to lay down their arms . 
This Colorado-Communist accord or " COCO " allowed the [MISC Marxists  ] to maintain strong influence in the labor unions and higher education . 
Significantly , [MISC Communist  ] influence remains dominant in both sectors to this day . 
End Note . 
) COMMENT ------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Participants in the insurgency and the ideological left are still active in major parties of the [ORG FA  ] coalition , but while they have passed on their ideological legacy , they have generally been unable to develop leaders to organize and direct the future of the movement . 
The leaders of the far left are in their 70s , and few have an heir apparent . 
When the Socialist party elder statesman [PER Guillermo Chifflet  ] retired , one of his proteges told us that the party increasingly saw him as out of step with the new course charted by [PER Tabare Vazquez  ] . 
Several political observers believe that when the current leadership of the [ORG MPP  ] retires in the next few years , the movement will be ungovernable as inept radical deputies fight among themselves . 
The one exception to this rule is the powerful union movement in [LOC Uruguay  ] ( PIT-CNT ) which continues to have strong [MISC Communist  ] sympathies , fervent anti-U.S. rhetoric , and well-established institutions . 
Union institutions exercise power through [MISC GOU-established  ] labor boards , short but regular work stoppages and occupations of production facilities . 
Because [PER Vazquez  ] continues to set a new course for the left , the future of the far-left is further in doubt . 
But leftist reaction to the dictatorship period remains high , and will continue to exert strong influence on [MISC Uruguayan  ] politics for some time to come .
