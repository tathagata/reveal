End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( SBU ) On April 2 [ORG Pfizer  ] lawyers [PER Joe Petrosinelli  ] and [PER Atiba Adams  ] and [ORG Pfizer Nigeria Country  ] Director [PER Enrico Liggeri  ] met with the Ambassador and EconDep to discuss the status of settlement negotiations . 
Four lawsuits were brought against [ORG Pfizer  ] stemming from medical tests with the oral antibiotic [PER Trovan  ] conducted on children living in [LOC Kano  ] during a meningitis epidemic in 1996 . 
In [LOC Kano State  ] Court there is one civil suit and one criminal case and in the [ORG Federal High Court  ] there is one civil suit and one criminal case . 
Since 2006 , [PER Petrosinelli  ] and [PER Adams  ] have been briefing the [ORG Mission  ] on the status of the cases . 
Settlement Reached ------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Petrosinelli  ] reported that [ORG Pfizer  ] had tentatively reached “an agreement in principle” on the [ORG Kano AG’s  ] settlement offer of $75 million . 
[PER Adams  ] explained that the parties agreed that the $75 million would be broken down as follows - a $10 million payment for legal fees ; $30 million to the [LOC Kano State  ] government ; and $35 million to participants and families . 
[PER Petrosinelli  ] noted , that [ORG Pfizer  ] has worked closely with former [MISC Nigerian  ] Head of State [PER Yakubu Gowon  ] and that he has played a positive mediation role with [LOC Kano State  ] and the federal government . 
[PER Petrosinelli  ] said [PER Gowon  ] also spoke with [LOC Kano State  ] Governor [PER Mallam Ibrahim Shekarau  ] , who directed the [ORG Kano AG  ] to reduce the settlement demand from $150 million to $75 million . 
[PER Adams  ] reported that [PER Gowon  ] met with President [PER Yar’Adua  ] and convinced him to drop the two federal high court cases against [ORG Pfizer  ] . 
( Comment: In 1966 [PER Gowon  ] became the head of state following a military coup that deposed Major General [PER Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi  ] who had come to power via an earlier military coup . 
He was head of state from 1966 to 1975 . 
He now plays an elder statesman role in [MISC Nigerian  ] politics . 
End Comment . 
) More Discussions Needed ----------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) According to [PER Adams  ] , details need to be worked out on the mechanism for payments to the [LOC Kano State  ] government and participants because [ORG Pfizer  ] is unwilling to give a lump sum payment . 
[ORG Pfizer  ] is concerned with transparency issues and is pushing for a $35 million trust fund for the participants to be administered by a neutral third party and the remaining $30 million to be used for improving health care in [LOC Kano  ] state . 
[ORG Pfizer  ] underscored that the [MISC Nigerian  ] representatives were pushing for lump sum checks and [ORG Pfizer  ] will not agree to that . 
[ORG Pfizer  ] is considering rebuilding [ORG Kano’s Infectious Disease Hospital  ] where the trial was conducted and working with health care nongovernmental organizations . 
[PER Adams  ] suggested that the trust fund for participants be administered by a neutral third party because he expects “additional” participants to come forward after they hear about the settlement . 
The Ambassador suggested [ORG Pfizer  ] work with [ORG NGOs  ] already working in [LOC Kano State  ] and for [ORG Pfizer  ] to consider working with local [ORG NGO  ] implementing partners that the [ORG USG  ] has used because of their transparency record . 
[ORG ABUJA  ] 00000671 002 OF 002 EconDep provided [ORG Pfizer  ] a copy of the [ORG U.S.-Nigeria Framework for Partnership  ] document as a guide for existing projects and partners in [LOC Kano  ] . 
[PER Petrosinelli  ] explained that the next step was a meeting at a neutral location between high-level [ORG Pfizer  ] officials and the [MISC Nigerian  ] side to work out final details and conclude the settlement . 
[ORG Pfizer  ] Exposes Attorney General ------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In follow up to the April 2 meeting , EconDep met with [ORG Pfizer Country Manager  ] [PER Enrico Liggeri  ] in [LOC Lagos  ] on April 9 . 
( [PER Note: Liggeri  ] has years of experience in [LOC Nigeria  ] because his family operated a business in [LOC Lagos  ] from the early 1960s to the late 1980s . 
He spent most of his childhood in [LOC Lagos  ] . 
End Note . 
) [PER Liggeri  ] said [ORG Pfizer  ] was not happy settling the case , but had come to the conclusion that the $75 million figure was reasonable because the suits had been ongoing for many years costing [ORG Pfizer  ] more than $15 million a year in legal and investigative fees . 
According to [PER Liggeri  ] , [ORG Pfizer  ] had hired investigators to uncover corruption links to [ORG Federal Attorney General  ] [PER Michael Aondoakaa  ] to expose him and put pressure on him to drop the federal cases . 
He said Pfizer’s investigators were passing this information to local media , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
A series of damaging articles detailing [MISC Aondoakaa’s  ] “alleged” corruption ties were published in February and March . 
[PER Liggeri  ] contended that [ORG Pfizer  ] had much more damaging information on [PER Aondoakaa  ] and that [MISC Aondoakaa’s  ] cronies were pressuring him to drop the suit for fear of further negative articles. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Liggeri  ] commented that the lawsuits were wholly political in nature because the [ORG NGO  ] Doctors Without Borders administered [PER Trovan  ] to other children during the 1996 meningitis epidemic and the [MISC Nigerian  ] government has taken no action . 
He underscored that the suit has had a “chilling effect” on international pharmaceutical companies because companies are no longer willing to conduct clinical testing in [LOC Nigeria  ] . 
[PER Liggeri  ] opined that when another outbreak occurs no company will come to [MISC Nigeria’s  ] aid. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Comment: Pfizer’s image in [LOC Nigeria  ] has been damaged due to this ongoing case . 
Pfizer’s management considers [LOC Nigeria  ] a major growth market for its products and having this case behind it will help in efforts to rebuild its image here . 
Final discussions on the $30 million and $35 million are likely to be tricky because the [MISC Nigerian  ] side wants to control who gets the money , not [ORG Pfizer  ] . 
The [ORG U.S. Mission  ] will continue to advocate for transparency in settling the case and also note to [LOC GON  ] authorities that [ORG Pfizer  ] must abide by the [ORG U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act  ] and cannot simple hand over large sums of money to state and local officials . 
[PER Petrosinelli  ] and [PER Adams  ] will get back to the [ORG Mission  ] on what further assistance may be needed .
