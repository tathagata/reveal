Reconciliation between [LOC Germany  ] and [LOC China  ] ---------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [LOC Germany  ] and [LOC China  ] , whose relations had soured in the wake of Chancellor [PER Angela Merkel’s September  ] 23 meeting with the [PER Dalai Lama  ] , began to thaw when [MISC German  ] Foreign Minister [PER Frank-Walter Steinmeier  ] met [MISC Chinese  ] Foreign Minister [PER Yang Jiechi  ] at the [ORG Annapolis Conference  ] November 26-27 . 
At that meeting , [PER Yang  ] suggested an exchange of letters to clarify Germany’s position on [LOC China  ] , [LOC Taiwan  ] and the one [LOC China  ] policy . 
In its letter , [LOC Germany  ] reaffirmed its positions that “Taiwan and [LOC Tibet  ] are integral parts of [LOC China  ] , ” that [LOC Germany  ] does not support separatism and opposes the [LOC Taiwan  ] referendum on [ORG UN  ] membership . 
The [MISC German  ] letter also stated that [MISC Sino-German  ] relations are founded on “mutual respect , equality and a concern for each other’s key international interests.” [LOC China  ] asked the [MISC German  ] government to consider additions to the letter , but the [MISC Germans  ] refused . 
In its letter of acknowledgement , [LOC China  ] added a “confirmation” regarding [MISC German  ] non-interference in China’s internal affairs , which the [MISC German  ] letter had not mentioned . 
Given the delicate nature of the situation , however , the [MISC German  ] Government decided not to argue the point . 
At a later meeting with [MISC Chinese  ] Assistant Foreign Minister [PER Wu Hongbo  ] , [MISC German  ] Ambassador [PER Schaefer  ] said the [MISC German  ] Chancellor can and will meet “whomever she wants , whenever she wants.” [MISC German  ] Ambassador [PER Schaefer  ] noted that different countries have received different treatment following their leaders’ meetings with the [PER Dalai Lama  ] . 
He said the [LOC United States  ] escaped virtually unscathed while the [MISC Austrian  ] Ambassador to this day remains “a pariah , ” unable to meet even a Director General at the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] . 
[MISC German  ] Vice-Chancellor Visit ---------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 .

( C ) [MISC German  ] Ambassador [PER Schaefer  ] said that from the [MISC German  ] point of view , the [MISC P5-plus-1  ] ( P3-plus-3 ) meeting in [LOC Berlin  ] was “good , ” as it showed cohesion among the six parties , who demonstrated a continued willingness to negotiate if [LOC Iran  ] stops enrichment activities . 
The new [ORG UNSC  ] resolution will be a combination of [ORG UNSC  ] resolutions 1737 and 1747 with added elements that will send a clear signal to the people of [LOC Iran  ] in advance of upcoming elections that the [MISC Iranian  ] government is “going in the wrong direction.” [LOC Germany  ] has implemented effective new rules for banks that deal with [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Schaefer  ] said . 
The rules are not full sanctions , but a “name and shame practice” that requires increased supervision for banks that deal with [LOC Iran  ] . 
As a result of these rules , [PER Schaefer  ] claimed that no [MISC German  ] banks are willing to conduct business with [MISC Iranian  ] banks and even [MISC Chinese  ] and [MISC Russian  ] banks have increased their supervision of [MISC Iranian  ] dealings .

[PER Brown  ] and [PER Wen  ] struck such a good relationship that when [MISC Brown’s  ] visit continued in [LOC Shanghai  ] , [PER Wen  ] accompanied him , despite not having prior plans to do so . 
During the visit , both sides agreed to hold an Economic and [ORG Financial Dialogue  ] at the Vice Premier-level and the [LOC UK  ] invited the [MISC Chinese  ] [ORG Sovereign Wealth Fund  ] , the [ORG China Investment Corporation  ] , to establish an office in [LOC London  ] , provided the fund remains transparent and commercially-motivated .

[ORG UK-China Entrepreneurs Lunch  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 .
