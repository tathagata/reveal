( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG SUMMARY: Post  ] warmly welcomes you to The [PER Hague  ] to convene the 2009 [ORG Regional Energy Officers Conference  ] . 
During your stay , you will also meet the Foreign Minister , Economic Affairs Minister , [ORG Royal Dutch Shell  ] 's Executive Director responsible for Russia/Central [LOC Asia  ] , and address [MISC Dutch  ] energy industry and policy leaders at the [MISC Netherlands'  ] premier think tank . 
No high-level [LOC U.S.  ] official has discussed energy security in the [LOC Netherlands  ] ( the world 's fifth-largest natural gas exporter ) in several years . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] fundamentally share our commitment to enhancing [LOC Europe  ] 's energy security through diverse sources and supply routes . 
However , we would like the [MISC Dutch  ] to take on a more prominent role within the [ORG EU  ] to achieve these objectives and avoid backsliding into narrow commercial diplomacy . 
END SUMMARY. --------------------- [ORG DUTCH  ] ENERGY OVERVIEW --------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC U  ] ) The [MISC Netherlands'  ] energy position is unique within the [ORG EU  ] . 
It is the world 's seventh largest gas producer and the [ORG EU  ] 's largest net exporter of gas by a wide margin . 
The [LOC Netherlands  ] produces about 14 percent of the natural gas consumed in [LOC Europe  ] and has observer status at the recently formed [ORG Gas Exporting Countries Forum  ] . 
Since its discovery in 1959 , the giant [ORG Groningen  ] field has helped underwrite the [MISC Dutch  ] welfare state . 
( Note: [ORG Royal Dutch Shell  ] and [ORG ExxonMobil  ] are 50/50 partners in [MISC Nederlandse Aardolie  ] Maatschappij ( [ORG NAM  ] ) , the country 's largest gas producer and 60 percent shareholder of the [ORG Groningen  ] field ; the [MISC Dutch  ] state operator [ORG EBN  ] owns the remainder . 
End note . 
) The [MISC Dutch  ] economy runs on natural gas -- it accounts for 45 percent of primary energy supply and 58 percent of electricity production. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC U  ] ) The [MISC Netherlands'  ] gas reserves are forecast to run out by 2030 , forcing the [MISC Dutch  ] to rethink their energy policy . 
To remain a regional energy player after its own resources are depleted , the [MISC Dutch  ] government is patiently cultivating energy relationships with [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC Algeria  ] , [LOC Kazakhstan  ] , [LOC Libya  ] , [LOC Qatar  ] , and [LOC Angola  ] as long-term supplier countries . 
The [LOC Netherlands  ] wants to develop as a natural gas roundabout -- a hub that gathers natural gas from various sources ( [LOC North Sea  ] , [LOC LNG  ] , [LOC Russia  ] ) and then distributes it via pipeline to continental [LOC Europe.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC U  ] ) The [MISC Dutch  ] are also pursuing opportunities to develop gas storage reservoirs . 
The prevalence of depleted gas fields means the [LOC Netherlands  ] has huge storage potential , either for natural gas or carbon dioxide ( CCS ) . 
[LOC Abu Dhabi  ] national energy company [ORG TAQA  ] announced in December 2008 it would lead a consortium developing a USD 1 billion , 4.1 billion cubic meter gas storage facility in [LOC Bergermeer  ] ( in conjunction with [ORG Gazprom  ] and [ORG EBN  ] ) to be operational by 2013 . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] oppose [ORG EU  ] regulations that would require each [ORG EU  ] member state to have adequate gas storage capacity of its own . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] want to provide storage service to others in the region -- for a price. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Port of Rotterdam  ] is one of the world 's major centers for crude oil imports , trading , refining , and petrochemical production . 
Key oil import sources include [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , and [LOC Norway  ] . 
[LOC Vitol  ] , [LOC Trafigura  ] , and [ORG Shell  ] operate there and export oil to [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC U  ] ) The [MISC Dutch  ] want [LOC Rotterdam  ] to become an important destination for [ORG LNG  ] as well . 
[MISC Dutch  ] companies [ORG Vopak  ] ( liquid storage ) and [ORG Gasunie  ] ( gas pipelines ) are teaming up to build a 12 billion cubic meter ( bcm ) per year [ORG LNG  ] terminal at the port , due for completion in 2011 . 
[ORG TAQA  ] is planning a sea-based [ORG LNG  ] terminal near [LOC Rotterdam  ] . 
On the other side of [MISC Qsea-based  ] [ORG LNG  ] terminal near [LOC Rotterdam  ] . 
On the other side of the country , energy company [ORG Essent  ] ( now owned by [LOC Germany  ] 's [ORG RWE  ] ) is developing an [ORG LNG  ] terminal with [ORG Vopak  ] and [ORG Gasunie  ] in [LOC Eemshaven  ] , near the [MISC German  ] border. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) Despite the [ORG GONL  ] 's enthusiastic support for strict [ORG EU  ] renewable energy targets , the country derives only 2.5 percent of its total energy supply from renewables , mostly biomass and wind . 
Grand plans and subsidy schemes abound for offshore wind parks in the [LOC North Sea  ] , but these have not left the drawing board. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [LOC U  ] ) The [LOC Netherlands  ] has one 485 MW nuclear plant in [LOC Borssele  ] , co-owned by utilities [ORG Delta  ] and [ORG Essent  ] . 
[ORG Delta  ] wants to build additional reactors on the same site , but nuclear energy is a political taboo , and the current government is reluctant to approve any expansion plans. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [LOC U  ] ) The [LOC Netherlands  ] embraced full ownership unbundling of its electricity and gas utility companies in order to attract new investment capital and increae competition . 
Local THE HAGUE 00000596 002.2 OF 004 government authorities have retained ownership of regulated network businesses , but foreign energy giants [ORG RWE  ] and [ORG Vattenfall  ] acquired the two largest [MISC Dutch  ] energy supply and production companies -- [ORG Essent  ] and [LOC Nuon  ] , respectively -- in <a id='par2009' href='#par2009'>¶</a>2009 . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] government was frustrated when [LOC Germany  ] and [LOC France  ] succeeded in watering down the [ORG EU  ] 's unbundling rules in favor of national champions. ----------------------- [ORG GASUNIE  ] AND [ORG NORD STREAM  ] ----------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Dutch  ] gas pipeline company [ORG Gasunie  ] is 100 percent state-owned , unlike most other [MISC European  ] gas infrastructure companies . 
The [ORG GONL  ] maintains an arms-length relationship with [ORG Gasunie  ] 's management , expecting it to operate like a publicly traded company and earn a reasonable return of around 7 percent for the government , according to Finance Minister [PER Wouter Bos.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Gasunie  ] holds a 9 percent stake in [ORG Gazprom  ] 's [ORG Nord Stream  ] pipeline . 
This participation was announced during Prime Minister [PER Balkenende  ] 's November 2007 visit to [LOC Russia  ] . 
[ORG Gasunie  ] CEO [PER Marcel Kramer  ] told post the [ORG GONL  ] gave positive feedback to the deal as a way of retaining a significant role for the [LOC Netherlands  ] in [LOC Europe  ] 's energy equation . 
To burnish [ORG Nord Stream  ] 's image , [ORG Gasunie  ] has tried hard to portray the project as ambitious but realistic ; to characterize [ORG Gazprom  ] as driven by commercial concerns , not political ones ; and to leverage the [MISC Dutch  ] reputation as transparent , trustworthy businesspeople. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Gasunie  ] has a 60 percent share in the [LOC Bacton Balgzand Line  ] ( [ORG BBL  ] ) , operational since 2006 , which transports natural gas from the [LOC Netherlands  ] to the [LOC UK  ] ( although it is bi-directional ) . 
[MISC Belgian  ] gas transport company [ORG Fluxys  ] and [MISC German  ] energy giant e.ON [ORG Ruhrgas  ] each have 20 percent shares . 
In exchange for [ORG Gasunie  ] 's share in [ORG Nord Stream  ] , [ORG Gazprom  ] received an option to buy a 9 percent stake in [ORG BBL  ] . 
If [ORG Gazprom  ] exercises this option , the shares will come from [ORG Gasunie  ] , leaving it with a majority 51 percent . 
According to [PER Kramer  ] , [ORG Gasunie  ] had to explain to [ORG Gazprom  ] that [ORG BBL  ] meets [ORG EU  ] rules , meaning the shareholders just own and operate the pipeline but cannot dictate who runs gas through it . 
Post has heard that [ORG BBL  ] did not reverse flow ( i.e. , send gas from [LOC UK  ] to continental [LOC Europe  ] ) during the winter 2009 Russia/Ukraine gas crisis. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( U ) [ORG Gasunie  ] bought [ORG BEB Transport  ] -- the gas transport division of a [MISC German  ] [ORG Shell/Exxon  ] joint venture -- in November <a id='par2007' href='#par2007'>¶</a>2007 . 
[ORG BEB  ] 's pipelines tie into [ORG Gasunie  ] 's existing network , linking the [LOC Netherlands  ] to northern [LOC Germany  ] , [LOC Berlin  ] , [LOC Denmark  ] , and the landing points for [MISC Norwegian  ] gas. --------------------------------------------- --------- MEETING FOREIGN MINISTER AND [ORG ECONOMIC AFFAIRS  ] MINISTER --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Foreign Minister [PER Maxime Verhagen  ] and [ORG Economic Affairs  ] Minister [PER Maria van der Hoeven  ] constitute an active tag team on energy diplomacy with producer countries as they pursue the [MISC Netherlands'  ] vision of becoming a gas hub . 
[PER Verhagen  ] , a career politician , and [PER Van der Hoeven  ] , an educator before embarking on politics , both belong to the center-right [ORG Christian Democratic Appeal  ] ( [ORG CDA  ] ) party , the ruling coalition 's largest . 
When you meet [PER Van der Hoeven  ] , she will have just returned from the [ORG Kazakhstan International Oil  ] and [ORG Gas Expo  ] and a September 23-26 visit to the [LOC U.S.  ] where she met with Energy Secretary [PER Chu  ] . 
A planned meeting with Commerce Secretary Locke did not happen . 
Her [ORG Ministry of Economic Affairs  ] ( [ORG MEA  ] ) spans energy , commerce , and trade . 
[ORG Qof Economic Affairs  ] ( [ORG MEA  ] ) spans energy , commerce , and trade . 
In the past year , she has visited [LOC Angola  ] ( March 2009 to lobby for future [ORG LNG  ] shipments to [LOC Rotterdam  ] ) , [LOC Algeria  ] ( January 2009 also for [ORG LNG  ] supplies ) , [LOC Russia  ] ( December 2008 for broad energy investment ) , [LOC Qatar  ] ( October 2008 for [ORG LNG  ] ) , and [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] ( October 2008 for broad energy investment ) . 
[PER Verhagen  ] visited [LOC Qatar  ] and [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] ( May 2009 ) and [LOC Algeria  ] ( November 2008 ) to push for closer economic and energy cooperation as well as human rights. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Under [PER Van der Hoeven  ] 's lead , the [MISC Netherlands'  ] overarching goals in the energy sector are similar to ours: maintain open markets , ensure diverse and secure supply sources , and develop new and clean alternatives to fossil fuels . 
As she said in a speech during her recent trip to [LOC Washington  ] , The way to improve energy supply security is to build and maintain good relations with energy suppliers .. . 
The solution is a variety of sources and suppliers ... to stimulate an energy mix for [LOC Europe  ] that consists of the whole palette: fossil fuels , sustainable energy , and nuclear energy THE HAGUE 00000596 003.2 OF 004 on a way to sustainable energy . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] support the main points of [ORG EU  ] strategic energy policy , especially interconnections . 
However , they are reluctant to be [LOC Europe  ] 's producer of last resort in the event of a gas crisis as they plan to draw down their reserves slowly , prolonging the buffer they enjoy by virtue of their domestic production. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) We expect [PER Verhagen  ] and [PER Van der Hoeven  ] to raise the following issues: -- [ORG U.S.-EU Energy Council:  ] The [LOC Netherlands  ] will want to play an active role in the proposed [ORG UEEC  ] and will be eager to hear the [LOC U.S.  ] vision for this body . 
-- [ORG Caspian Basin: The Ministers  ] will be interested to discuss how the [LOC United States  ] and the [LOC Netherlands  ] can align our energy strategy in the region . 
They will also want to exchange views on the [ORG Caspian Development Corporation  ] . 
-- Energy Charter [LOC Treaty: Russia  ] 's decision to withdraw from the [ORG ECT  ] caught the [MISC Dutch  ] by surprise . 
They judge it to be a self-defeating move but will want to maintain other channels of [LOC EU-Russia  ] dialogue on energy matters . 
-- Turkey/Southern Corridor: Minister [PER Verhagen  ] will likely share the [MISC Dutch  ] perspective on [MISC Nabucco  ] and relations with [LOC Turkey  ] . 
( Note: Former [MISC Nabucco  ] coordinator and [MISC Dutch  ] Foreign Minister [PER Jozias van Aartsen  ] is now Mayor of The [PER Hague  ] . 
End Note . 
) -- [ORG International Energy Forum:  ] The [MISC Dutch  ] have firm advocates of IEF 's producer-consumer dialogue . 
( Note: IEF Secretary General [PER Noe van Hulst  ] is a [MISC Dutch  ] national and former DG for energy at [ORG MEA  ] . 
End note . 
) -- [ORG Russia:  ] The [MISC Dutch  ] acknowledge we have some differences concerning [LOC Russia  ] ( see below ) and will want to discuss them . 
-- [ORG Iran:  ] The [ORG GONL  ] and [ORG Shell  ] ( see below ) are both concerned about proposed [LOC U.S.  ] legislation to impose sanctions on companies selling refined products to [LOC Iran  ] . 
They think this will only succeed in giving [MISC Chinese  ] and [MISC Russian  ] companies access to [LOC Iran  ] 's hydrocarbon resources at the expense of [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC European  ] competitors. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Commercial interests are always central to [MISC Dutch  ] economic relations and nowhere is this more evident than with [LOC Russia  ] . 
For example , during President [PER Medvedev  ] 's June 2009 visit to the [LOC Netherlands  ] , he met with representatives from major [MISC Dutch  ] companies including [ORG Shell  ] , [ORG Phillips  ] , and [ORG ING  ] . 
According to a well-placed [ORG MEA  ] official , Prime Minister [ORG Balkenende  ] hit if off with [ORG Gazprom  ] Chairman ( and former [MISC Russian  ] PM ) [PER Viktor Zubkov  ] during the visit and they agreed that energy and gas cooperation remains central to their relationship . 
The two countries committed to increasing [MISC Russian  ] companies' investment in the [LOC Port  ] of [LOC Rotterdam  ] , and [LOC Russia  ] 's [ORG Lukoil  ] acquired a 45 percent stake in a Total refinery in south [LOC Holland  ] . 
However , the [MISC Dutch  ] are defensive about the clubby atmosphere of these twice-yearly high-level visits . 
[ORG GONL  ] energy officials have told us bluntly in the past , Don't lecture us about [LOC Russia  ] . 
They are especially sensitive to criticism about [LOC Nord Stream  ] ; [ORG MEA  ] took offense at the September 2008 editorial written by the then [LOC U.S.  ] Ambassador to [LOC Sweden  ] raising objections to the pipeline . 
Despite close commercial relations with [LOC Russia  ] , the [ORG GONL  ] supports the so-called [ORG Gazprom  ] clause and would likely try to block a [MISC Russian  ] takeover of a [MISC Dutch  ] utility without reciprocal market access. ----- [ORG SHELL  ] ----- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As [MISC Forbes'  ] number two global corporation ( after GE ) , Rotal [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG Shell  ] exerts strong influence on [MISC Dutch  ] foreign economic policy . 
For example , [PER Simon Smits  ] ( [ORG MFA  ] 's Director for [ORG Economic Cooperation  ] whom you will meet October Q7 ) recently returned from a secondment to [ORG Shell  ] 's government relations group . 
Finance Minister Bos also held executive positions at [ORG Shell  ] in the 1990s before turning to politics . 
You will meet [PER Matthias Bichsel  ] , [ORG Shell  ] 's Executive Director responsible for Russia/Central [LOC Asia  ] , on October 9 . 
Large [MISC Dutch  ] dredging and energy infrastracture companies such as Boskalis , [PER Van Oord  ] , and [ORG Fugro  ] also enjoy substantial political influence. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Shell  ] tries to keep the [LOC U.S.  ] government updated on the [ORG Persian LNG  ] ( [ORG PLNG  ] ) project . 
[ORG Shell  ] is a minority partner in [ORG PLNG  ] and has successfully delayed a final investment decision for several years . 
[ORG Shell  ] wants to keep a foothold THE HAGUE 00000596 004.2 OF 004 on the project and not let ( yet another ) lucrative , long-term [MISC Iranian  ] energy contract go to [LOC China  ] , but knows it cannot move ahead on the project in the current climate . 
[ORG Shell  ] would welcome another [ORG UNSC  ] resolution that levels the playing field by imposing broader trade sanctions on [LOC Iran  ] and forcing [MISC Chinese  ] and [MISC Russian  ] firms to comply , thereby reducing the [MISC IOCs'  ] competitive disadvantage. ----------- [ORG CLINGENDAEL  ] ----------- <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( U ) Your participation in the [ORG Eurasian Energy Security  ] roundtable with Minister van der [PER Hoeven  ] at the [ORG Clingendael International Energy Program  ] will send a positive signal about [LOC U.S.  ] willingness to engage with [MISC European  ] allies on this issue . 
The audience will include [MISC Dutch  ] energy executives and policy makers eager to hear your remarks and ask you questions about [LOC U.S.  ] international energy strategy .
