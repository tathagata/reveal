( [ORG SBU  ] ) In a move that adds momentum to [LOC Libya  ] 's promising banking reform efforts , the [ORG Libyan Central Bank  ] announced that the [ORG Jordan-based Arab Bank  ] won the tendering process to buy 19 percent of [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG Wahda Bank  ] . 
According to press reports , [ORG Arab Bank  ] 's winning bid of 210 million euros ( $310 million ) easily outstripped the second highest bid of 121 million euros ( $180 million ) by [MISC Bahrain-based  ] [ORG Arab Banking Corporation  ] . 
Other short-listed bidders falling short of the mark were [LOC Morocco  ] 's [ORG Attijariwafa Bank  ] , [LOC Italy  ] 's [ORG Intesa Sanpaolo.  ] and [MISC French  ] bank [ORG Societe Generale  ] ( [ORG Note: Societe Generale  ] announced its withdrawal from the competition on February 12 for undisclosed reasons ; Econoff subsequently learned the bank was uncomfortable with elements of the shareholding agreement . 
End Note ) . 
According to a fact sheet issued by [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG Central Bank  ] , [ORG Wahda Bank  ] is the country 's second largest commercial bank in terms of total loan portfolio , with a market share of over 20% . 
It is the fifth largest commercial bank in terms of total assets , with 1.7 billion euros ( $2.6 billion ) and 71 branches throughout the country . 
2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The shares obtained by [ORG Arab Bank  ] were previously owned by the [ORG Libyan Economic and Social Development Fund  ] ( [ORG ESDF  ] ) , which held 73 percent of [ORG Wahda  ] before the sale . 
With this sale , the [ORG ESDF  ] still has a majority stake of 54 percent , but [ORG Arab Bank  ] will assume management control of [ORG Wahda  ] . 
The remaining [ORG Wahda  ] shares are currently held by the [ORG Libyan Central Bank  ] ( 14 percent ) and a collection of [MISC Libyan  ] investors and companies ( 13 percent ) . 
Under the terms of its purchase , [ORG Arab Bank  ] will have the right to eventually raise its stake in [ORG Wahda Bank  ] to 51 percent over the next three to five years . 
3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: This sale marks the second successful privatization of a [MISC Libyan  ] commercial bank , following a similar deal struck with [LOC France  ] 's [ORG BNP Paribas  ] in its purchase of a 19 percent stake in [ORG Sahara Bank  ] in September 2007 ( reftel ) . 
The [ORG Central Bank  ] continues to draw on foreign expertise for pushing through its banking reform strategy , with [ORG McKinsey and Company  ] ( strategic advisor ) , [PER Rothschild  ] ( financial advisor ) , Baker and [PER McKenzie  ] ( legal ) and [ORG KPMG  ] ( accountants ) all playing substantial roles . 
With the privatizations of [ORG Wahda  ] and [LOC Sahara  ] well in hand , the next target for the [ORG Central Bank  ] will be solidifying its December 2007 merger of the state-owned [LOC Jamahiriya  ] and [ORG Umma Banks  ] into a single entity , the [ORG Libyan Bank  ] .
