( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY: In July , the [ORG Brazilian National Institute of Industrial Property  ] ( [ORG INPI  ] ) rejected a patent application by [ORG California-based Gilead Sciences  ] for its HIV drug Viread ( scientific name: tenofovir ) . 
During a trip to [LOC Brazil  ] to discuss the case with GOB officials , senior [ORG Gilead  ] representatives briefed Econ and Commercial officers on August 6 in [LOC Brasilia  ] . 
The patent rejection ( which [ORG INPI  ] told [ORG Gilead  ] was " purely technical " but accompanied by " lots of pressure " from the [ORG Ministry of Health  ] ) could be the final step in allowing generic production of tenofovir , since the [ORG Ministry of Health  ] ( [ORG MOH  ] ) has already declared tenofovir to be a drug of public interest ( April 2008 ) and established an inter-ministerial group to oversee the development of domestic production capacity ( May 2009 ) . 
More broadly , the decision carries troubling indications for the protection of innovative pharmaceutical products in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
END SUMMARY. --------------------------------------------- [ORG GILEAD  ] TO GOB: DISAGREE , BUT COMITTED TO PATIENT CARE --------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Gilead  ] intends to file a judicial appeal of the patent rejection in the next 45 to 55 days and will seek an injunction against any applications for generic license . 
[ORG Gilead  ] representatives described their message to the GOB as one of clear disappointment but also continuing commitment to a productive relationship . 
They characterized meetings with [ORG MOH  ] and the [ORG National Health Vigilance Agency  ] ( [ORG ANVISA  ] ) as " encouraging " ( specifically , the fact that the director of [LOC Brazil  ] 's AIDS program requested a meeting to discuss supplies of Viread for next year ) and showing " good intent . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] , the [ORG Gilead  ] team met with the Vice President of [ORG INPI  ] and a group of patent examiners . 
During the meeting , which they described as awkward and tense , they said [ORG INPI  ] admitted to being under " lots of pressure " from [ORG MOH  ] on the [MISC Viread  ] decision . 
However , according to [ORG Gilead  ] , the [ORG INPI  ] officials also tried to emphasize that the decision had been " purely technical " and was " consistent with how [ [ORG INPI  ] ] view [ s ] pharmaceutical patents . 
" ( [ORG Comment: Post  ] would not have expected [ORG MOH  ] to apply pressure directly to [ORG INPI  ] , since [ORG MOH  ] 's own [ORG ANVISA  ] would have reviewed the application after [ORG INPI  ] , had [ORG INPI  ] approved it , and could have independently rejected it ( pharmaceutical patent applications must be approved by [ORG INPI  ] and then [ORG ANVISA  ] before a patent can be issued ) . 
This may suggest that [ORG MOH  ] fears differing determinations on patentability by [ORG INPI  ] and [ORG ANVISA  ] could weaken the GOB position in a judicial appeal . 
End comment . 
) --------------------------------------------- " INCREMENTAL INNOVATION " AND SECOND-USE PATENTS --------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG INPI  ] 's rejection of the [MISC Viread  ] patent claims that the drug fails to meet the requirement for inventiveness . 
[ORG Gilead  ] counters that many pharmaceutical breakthroughs are based on " incremental innovation " and that the invention of [MISC Viread  ] did involve the " inventive step " necessary to qualify for patent protection . 
[ORG Gilead  ] told [ORG Emboffs  ] that if [ORG INPI  ] is implying opposition to approving patents on incrementally innovative pharmaceuticals , [ORG Gilead  ] products and those of other pharmaceutical companies are likely to encounter difficulty in the near future. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The issue of patents for incremental innovation in pharmaceuticals has been the subject of ongoing debate within the GOB . 
In April 2008 , [ORG INPI  ] issued preliminary internal guidelines allowing such patents . 
This decision was criticized by [ORG MOH  ] because such patents could prevent the production of generics containing active substances already in the public domain . 
The [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) was also critical of [ORG INPI  ] 's guidelines and noted in press reports that the [ORG World Trade Organization  ] 's [ORG Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property  ] ( [ORG TRIPS  ] ) does not require patent protection for polymorphs or second-use pharmaceutical products. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) In December 2009 , the [ORG Interministerial Group for Intellectual Property  ] ( [ORG GIPI  ] ) - of which [ORG INPI  ] is not a voting member - made an administrative ruling against granting polymorph and second-use patents . 
Two bills currently before the [ORG Brazilian Chamber of Deputies  ] ( [ORG PL  ] 2511/07 and [ORG PL  ] 3995/08 ) would amend [LOC Brazil  ] 's intellectual property law to forbid patents for incremental innovations . 
Both bills remain in Chamber committee and have not reached the floor . 
[LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001017 002 OF 002 --------------------------------------------- [ORG GILEAD  ] TO USG: SPEAK SOFTLY AND CARRY NO STICK --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In a meeting with [ORG Emboffs  ] , [ORG Gilead  ] acknowledged that all signs point to generic production of tenofovir . 
While the company intends to file a judicial appeal , it also wants to continue what it calls a positive relationship with [ORG MOH  ] and find a " constructive path forward . 
" [ORG Gilead  ] intends to seek new patents in [LOC Brazil  ] and says it will not " hold patients hostage " as a result of the [MISC Viread  ] patent rejection . 
8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Gilead  ] representatives requested that the [ORG USG  ] register disappointment with the GOB regarding the [MISC Viread  ] patent rejection and highlight [LOC Brazil  ] 's position as an " outlier " in this case - every other country where an application was filed has approved the [MISC Viread  ] patent . 
( [ORG Note: Gilead  ] said that in meetings with the [ORG Brazilian Ministry of Commerce  ] ( [ORG MDIC  ] ) and a patient rights group , interlocutors erroneously believed the [ORG U.S. Patent and Trademark Office  ] ( [ORG USPTO  ] ) rejected [MISC Viread  ] 's patent application in the [LOC United States  ] . 
Although [ORG USPTO  ] temporarily suspended the patent ( as is standard practice ) when a challenge was filed in 2008 , the patent was later upheld . 
End note . 
) [ORG Gilead  ] reps suggested that the arrival of a new Ambassador might afford new opportunities to discuss the case with high-level GOB interlocutors . 
They repeated , however , that they intend to keep their response positive and non-threatening and that [ORG USG  ] engagement should simply convey that the case " has not gone unnoticed . 
" ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Viread  ] decision ( and the signs of political pressure applied by [ORG MOH  ] ) raises new questions about the protection of intellectual property in the pharmaceutical sector in [LOC Brazil  ] , where the [ORG Health Ministry  ] 's apparent " industrial policy " approach to the health care sector has not been countered by other , more pro-IP/pro-innovation voices within GOB . 
Based on decisions from patent authorities around the world , [MISC Viread  ] 's scientific case seems strong . 
[ORG INPI  ] 's admission of [ORG MOH  ] pressure calls into question the " purely technical " nature of this decision and , more broadly , the strength and independence of [LOC Brazil  ] 's patent regime. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Compulsory licensing has been a topic of much discussion since [LOC Brazil  ] 's 2007 decision to issue a compulsory license for [ORG Merck  ] 's [MISC HIV  ] drug Stocrin ( scientific name: efavirenz ) and will continue to be so . 
However , [LOC Brazil  ] 's current stance against patents for incremental innovation in pharmaceuticals could have equally damaging results . 
Political pressure to reject patent applications for legitimately innovative drugs could be a new front in [LOC Brazil  ] 's push to cut health costs and bolster its generic drug industry , but will ultimately damage innovation and competitiveness . 
The [ORG USG  ] has opportunities to engage on these issues with [ORG MRE  ] ( through the [ORG Economic Partnership Dialogue  ] , the [ORG Bilateral Consultative Mechanism  ] , and the [MISC Joint Consultative Mechanism  ] [ [ORG JCM  ] ] ) , [ORG MDIC  ] ( through the [ORG Commercial Dialogue  ] ) , the [ORG Ministry of Science and Technology  ] ( which will lead the delegation to the next [ORG JCM  ] ) , and through direct dialogue with the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Congress  ] . 
Continuing to press innovation/competitiveness themes and raise their profile within the spectrum of stake-holder agencies will remain an important part of the strategy to affect progress on intellectual property protection in [LOC Brazil  ] .
