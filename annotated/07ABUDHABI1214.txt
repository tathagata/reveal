ABU [LOC DHABI  ] 0702 ( ADM FALLON-MBZ ) Classified By: Ambassador [PER Michele J. Sison  ] , reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . 
SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) Secretary [PER Gates: Embassy Abu Dhabi  ] looks forward to your upcoming visit to Abu [LOC Dhabi  ] . 
Your principal interlocutor will be Abu [ORG Dhabi Crown Prince  ] and Deputy Supreme Commander of the [ORG UAE Armed Forces Sheikh  ] Mohamed bin [PER Zayed Al-Nahyan  ] ( [ORG MbZ  ] ) , whom you met at the [ORG Pentagon  ] on May <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] enjoys a strong defense cooperation relationship with the [LOC UAE  ] and the [ORG State-DOD-NSC-led Gulf Security Dialogue  ] ( [ORG GSD  ] ) has provided an opportunity to deepen that relationship . 
The [LOC UAE  ] delivers strong support in the war on terror ; has cooperated with us in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Lebanon  ] , and with security assistance to the [MISC Palestinians  ] ; and -- very importantly -- provides critical basing and over-flight for [LOC U.S.  ] reconnaissance and refueling assets as well as naval logistics support. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) While the [LOC UAE  ] has offered political support for [LOC Iraq  ] and identifies the first priority for the region as [MISC Iraqi  ] stability , the [LOC UAE  ] 's ( all-Sunni ) leadership has lately exhibited a hardened attitude toward Prime Minister [PER al Maliki  ] , perceiving him as beholden to [LOC Iran  ] and incapable of moving beyond sectarian bias to lead a unified [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The [LOC UAE  ] has in the past favored former Prime Minister [PER Iyad Allawi  ] and has stalled on its commitment to [MISC Iraqi  ] debt relief in order to avoid al [PER Maliki  ] claiming any credit . 
The [LOC UAE  ] has expressed concern over the continued violence and chaos in and around [LOC Baghdad  ] as well as the failure of the al [PER Maliki  ] government to improve overall security in the country . 
End Summary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) We suggest you thank [ORG MbZ  ] for his strong support for the [ORG U.S. Air Force  ] and [ORG Navy  ] in the [LOC UAE  ] and encourage continued partnership in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
We offer the following background on issues facing the [LOC UAE  ] and our bilateral relationship: <a id='parI' href='#parI'>¶</a>I . 
[ORG U.S. Defense Interests  ] ( para 4 ) II . 
[LOC Iraq  ] ( para 5 ) III . 
Other Regional Issues: [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Lebanon  ] , the [MISC Palestinians  ] ( paras 8-13 ) IV . 
[ORG Gulf Security Dialogue  ] ( para 14-15 ) <a id='parV' href='#parV'>¶</a>V . 
[ORG Defense Cooperation  ] and the [ORG DCA  ] ( paras 16-17 ) -------------------------- <a id='parI' href='#parI'>¶</a>I . 
[ORG U.S. DEFENSE INTERESTS  ] -------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) The [LOC UAE  ] 's contribution to [LOC U.S.  ] defense interests in the region has been extensive and enduring . 
The ports of [LOC Jebel Ali  ] and [LOC Fujairah  ] are vital to [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Navy  ] interdiction operations , re-supply and sustainment , and combat support efforts across the region . 
[LOC Jebel Ali  ] has hosted more port visits for each of the past three years than any other port outside the [LOC United States  ] . 
Quantitative measures of [LOC UAE  ] support include: --- 1,300 USAF personnel at [ORG Al Dhafra Air Base  ] ; --- a vigorous training schedule at the [ORG Gulf Air Warfare Center  ] at [ORG Al Dhafra  ] ; --- the [MISC F-16  ] [ORG Block  ] 60 program ; --- approximately 500 port visits last year ; --- over 24,000 [LOC US  ] military overflights/landings in 2006 ; --- more than 150,000 [LOC U.S.  ] servicemen and women enjoying liberty annually in the [LOC UAE  ] ; and --- 250 [ORG UAE Special Operations  ] forces serving with the [ORG Coalition  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( possibly increasing to 300 ) to include BMPs and [PER LeClerc  ] tanks . 
ABU DHABI 00001214 002 OF 004 You should express appreciation for this outstanding partnership . 
You might also remind [ORG MbZ  ] that the evolving nature of military requirements mandates a bilateral relationship focused on joint planning , coordination , and strategic interoperability. --------------------------------------------- ---- II . 
[LOC IRAQ  ] - [LOC UAE  ] LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN PM AL [PER MALIKI  ] --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) In recent months there has been a definite hardening of the [LOC UAE  ] leadership 's attitudes toward al [PER Maliki  ] , who is viewed by the [MISC Emiratis  ] as little more than an [MISC Iranian  ] puppet . 
The [LOC UAE  ] leadership has told us they do not see much hope in investing in [LOC Iraq  ] or much light on the horizon with al [PER Maliki  ] and his government . 
[LOC UAE  ] leaders perceive him as biased and incapable of leading a non-sectarian , unified [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Earlier [LOC UAE  ] commitments to forgive most of the $3.5 billion in [MISC Iraqi  ] debt the [LOC UAE  ] holds remain unfulfilled , with the [LOC UAE  ] leadership asking why it should give al [PER Maliki  ] a chance to claim credit for debt relief . 
( [PER Note: Although  ] the [LOC UAE  ] has not forgiven the debt , it is not collecting payments on it . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) Meanwhile , the [LOC UAE  ] has been engaged in regional efforts to facilitate reconciliation between [MISC Sunni  ] and [MISC Shi'a  ] forces . 
The [ORG UAEG  ] has frequently expressed alarm regarding [MISC Iranian  ] influence in [LOC Iraq  ] , and has made attempts to reach out to moderate [MISC Shi'a  ] to encourage their engagement in the [MISC Iraqi  ] political process independently of [LOC Iran  ] . 
The [LOC UAE  ] values and seeks reassurance of continued close consultation on [LOC U.S.  ] plans and strategy involving [LOC Iraq.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) While al [PER Maliki  ] has not visited the [LOC UAE  ] in a year , [ORG Iraqi National Security Adviser  ] Muwaffaq [PER Al Rubaie  ] was in [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] on June 28 , briefing the [ORG UAE National Security Advisor and Foreign Minister  ] ( both are [ORG MbZ  ] 's brothers ) on security developments in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Reportedly , [PER Al Rubaie  ] was told that the Group of Six nations ( [LOC UAE  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] , [LOC Jordan  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , [LOC Kuwait  ] ) would invite [LOC Iraq  ] 's security chief to its next meeting . 
According to the [LOC UAE  ] leadership , during this visit [PER Al Rubaie  ] took the attitude that [LOC UAE  ] outreach actions in [LOC Iraq  ] were hostile and also indirectly justified the [MISC Iranian  ] influence . 
[PER Al Rubaie  ] reportedly focused his efforts on urging the [MISC Emiratis  ] not to support the [MISC Iraqi  ] Sunnis . 
At the same time , [PER Al Rubaie  ] promised to work with the [ORG UAEG  ] to identify a location for a new [LOC UAE  ] embassy in [LOC Baghdad  ] . 
( Concern has been expressed by the [ORG Coalition  ] about the use by terrorists of the [LOC UAE  ] 's abandoned Embassy compound -- the [LOC UAE  ] has not maintained diplomatic staff in [LOC Baghdad  ] since the 2006 kidnapping of one of its diplomats . 
) -------------------------- III . 
OTHER REGIONAL ISSUES -------------------------- [LOC IRAN  ] - [LOC UAE  ] BALANCING ITS PRIVATE RHETORIC WITH PUBLIC CAUTION -------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) [ORG MbZ  ] has called privately for action sooner rather than later against [LOC Iran  ] and speaks caustically about [PER Ahmadinejad  ] . 
[ORG MbZ  ] may opine that any attempt at dialogue by [LOC Iran  ] should be regarded as a pure facade . 
He has also remarked that the [LOC UAE  ] thinks carefully about risks in the region and about its own future . 
The leadership has told us they are not in a position to sacrifice $16 billion in annual trade with [LOC Iran  ] , while realizing that this same neighbor and major trading partner is also a threat to the [LOC UAE  ] . 
It is also worth recalling that the May 10-12 visit of Vice President [PER Cheney  ] to the [LOC UAE  ] was immediately followed by a one-night stopover by [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , who gave a defiant anti-U.S. speech at a [LOC Dubai  ] sports arena . 
( The following day , [ORG MbZ  ] left on his official visit to [LOC Washington  ] , where he met you . 
) <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) However , much as they may assist our mission in the region , the [MISC Emiratis  ] are conscious of being vulnerable players in a rough and unforgiving neighborhood . 
The [LOC UAE  ] leadership has consistently pursued a cautious , non-confrontational public posture towards [LOC Iran  ] . 
In the past the [LOC UAE  ] has been hesitant to participate in certain military exercises . 
The [LOC UAE  ] did , however , send observers to Leading Edge 07 in October 2006 in the [LOC Gulf  ] , which had a ABU DHABI 00001214 003 OF 004 [ORG Proliferation Security Initiative  ] theme . 
The decision to host Eagle Resolve 2008 , with a [ORG Theater Air and Missile Defense  ] theme , should be seen as a praiseworthy step . 
[LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] - [LOC UAE  ] SPECIAL OPERATIONS TROOPS ------------------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) While the [LOC UAE  ] contributes 250 [ORG Special Operations  ] troops to the [ORG Coalition  ] effort in [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( with a potential increase of 50 ) , it has not yet publicly acknowledged this participation in [ORG Operation Enduring Freedom  ] . 
The [LOC UAE  ] pursues [LOC Afghanistan  ] reconstruction aid with an emphasis on road networks , mosques , medical facilities and schools and has made efforts at political mediation between [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
In January 2007 LTG Eikenberry escorted [ORG Afghan Armed Forces  ] Chief of Staff General [PER Bismillah Mohammadi Khan  ] to [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] in a bid to deepen direct engagement between the [LOC UAE  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The [ORG UAE Armed Forces  ] Chief of Staff declared himself willing to help in any way possible , including training [MISC Afghan  ] troops . 
[LOC UAE  ] subsequently disbursed another $30 million in general assistance and is renovating two runways in [LOC Afghanistan  ] for military use . 
During the June visit of [MISC Afghan  ] Defense Minister [LOC Wardak  ] to [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] , [ORG MbZ  ] agreed to donate nine [MISC Mi-19  ] helicopters to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
One of [ORG MbZ  ] 's oft-stated interests in sending [ORG Emirati Special  ] Ops troops to [LOC Afghanistan  ] is to get his military forces battle-hardened so they may effectively confront imported or domestic extremism . 
[LOC LEBANON  ] ( AND [LOC SYRIA  ] ) ------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S ) The [LOC UAE  ] provides significant humanitarian and security assistance to [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
The [LOC UAE  ] has been at the forefront of reconstruction efforts , continuing a longstanding de-mining operation , and contributing resources for school construction and hospitals . 
[ORG UAE Air Force C-130s  ] and helicopters have been used in relief efforts . 
The [LOC UAE  ] has also provided [MISC UAE-manufactured  ] pistols ( Caracal ) and ammunition to the [ORG LAF  ] . 
The [LOC UAE  ] Foreign Minister recently had a conversation with [MISC Lebanese  ] PM [PER Siniora  ] on a proposal for a [MISC Muslim  ] force for [LOC Lebanon  ] ( under [ORG UN  ] mandate ) . <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [LOC UAE  ] seeks to strengthen the [PER Siniora  ] government , having delivered $300 million in assistance to [LOC Lebanon  ] this year , while also seeking engagement with other parties . 
[LOC UAE  ] President Sheikh [PER Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan  ] and other senior [LOC UAE  ] officials paid a July 15-16 visit to [LOC Damascus  ] , announcing the donation of $10 million towards the support of [MISC Iraqi  ] refugees . 
The [LOC UAE  ] has conveyed private frustration and displeasure with [MISC Syrian  ] meddling in [LOC Lebanon  ] and has said it would express its ( and our ) concern about foreign fighters entering [LOC Iraq  ] through [LOC Syria  ] to the [MISC Syrian  ] leadership . 
[LOC UAE  ] 's goal , according to the [LOC UAE  ] Foreign Minister , is to try to persuade [MISC Syrian  ] President [PER Bashar Al Asad  ] to loosen his close ties to [LOC Iran  ] . 
[MISC Palestinian  ] Issue ----------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [LOC UAE  ] would like to see tangible progress on the [LOC Middle East  ] Roadmap , rejects the [ORG Hamas  ] agenda , and continues to support the [MISC Palestinian  ] people through more than $400 million in housing and humanitarian assistance since 2000 . 
[ORG MbZ  ] and his brothers , Foreign Minister [PER Abdullah  ] and [ORG National Security Advisor/State Security Director Hazza  ] , are in close contact with President [PER Mahmoud Abbas  ] and Prime Minister [PER Salam Fayyad  ] . 
As the result of the May 2007 visit of [ORG USSC General Dayton  ] , the [LOC UAE  ] transferred $80 million to the [MISC Palestinian  ] president . 
The [LOC UAE  ] has issued a public statement supporting the choice of [PER Tony Blair  ] as the Quartet envoy ( [PER Blair  ] is scheduled to meet [ORG MbZ  ] on July 24 ) . --------------------------- IV . 
[ORG GULF SECURITY DIALOGUE  ] --------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [LOC UAE  ] currently has over $2.6 billion in Foreign Military Sales cases and another $8.5 billion plus in direct commercial sales in the [ORG Block  ] 60 [MISC F-16  ] program , one of the premier portfolios in the [LOC USCENTCOM Area of Operations  ] . 
Since the May 2007 [ORG Gulf Security Dialogue  ] and earlier meetings of the [ORG Joint Military Committee  ] working groups and [ORG Air and Missile Defense  ] working group , we have seen progress ABU DHABI 00001214 004 OF 004 in our bilateral relationship in the areas of defense cooperation and regional security . 
The [ORG UAEG  ] has indicated strong interest in purchasing 12 Patriot PAC-3/GEM-T anti-ballistic missile batteries and other lower and upper-tier missile defense systems in order to create an overarching [ORG Air and Missile Defense  ] architecture and Concept of Operations . 
The [LOC UAE  ] has also requested Stinger/Avenger missiles for short range air defense and has expressed interest in Surface Launched Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile and [ORG Theater High Altitude Air Defense  ] missile system . 
The [LOC UAE  ] is on the verge of purchasing the [ORG High Mobility Artillery Rocket System  ] for counter battery , a case valued at approximately $650M . 
Both [ORG Boeing  ] and [ORG Northrop-Grumman  ] are providing Requests for Information on an [MISC Airborne Early Warning  ] and Control aircraft later this year . 
The [LOC UAE  ] has also expressed interest in leasing three [MISC E2-C Hawkeye  ] AEW&C aircraft as a stop-gap measure until a permanent AEW&C aircraft is procured. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [LOC UAE  ] has also made a request to buy 40 [MISC UH-60  ] Blackhawk helicopters for their [ORG Special Operations Command  ] . 
They should be offered a contract for 26 of those , plus a training package , in the next several weeks , a case valued at $750M . 
The [LOC UAE  ] is upgrading their [MISC AH-64 Apache  ] helicopters to the D ( LONGBOW ) model and has requested 1300 Hellfire missiles with the expectation of a request for an additional 1200 missiles . 
Three separate requests for additional weapons for their F-16s have been received , valued at over $200M . 
Additionally , the [LOC UAE  ] is coordinating to include [ORG Proliferation Security Initiative  ] themes in [LOC Iron Falcon  ] at the [LOC UAE  ] [ORG Air Warfare Center and Iron Siren  ] , a [ORG Naval Surface Warfare  ] exercise in the upcoming year. ----------------------------------- <a id='parV' href='#parV'>¶</a>V . 
DEFENSE COOPERATION AND THE [ORG DCA  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( S ) Although differences exist on status of forces issues and the use of passports/visas versus military IDs/orders for [LOC UAE  ] entry and exit , overall mil-to-mil cooperation with the [LOC UAE  ] has been excellent , with consistently reliable support at [LOC Jebel Ali  ] and [LOC Fujairah  ] ports and at [ORG Al Dhafra Air Base  ] . 
We are currently moving routine military cargo flight operations from [LOC UAE  ] civil airports in the northern [LOC Emirates  ] to the [MISC Minhad  ] air station , in accordance with the [LOC UAE  ] 's request. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [ORG Embassy  ] believes the timing may be right to make progress on negotiating a new [ORG Defense Cooperation Agreement  ] ( [ORG DCA  ] ) with the [LOC UAE  ] and has suggested submission of a [ORG USG  ] counter-draft in answer to the [LOC UAE  ] draft [ORG DCA  ] presented for possible discussion at October 17-19 [ORG Joint Military Committee  ] ( [ORG JMC  ] ) working group meetings and a full [ORG JMC  ] meeting tentatively set for January 15-17 , 2008 in [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] . 
We recommended that we urge the [LOC UAE  ] to sign a new [ORG DCA  ] superseding the unratified 1994 version as the official basis for existing and expanding military-to-military cooperation . 
( It is , however , important that no linkage be made between the [ORG DCA  ] and pending sales or other routine cooperation .
