( C ) SUMMARY . 
Post has comfirmed that a wholly [MISC Venezuelan  ] government-owned company , [PER Bolipuertos  ] , is now charged with the management of [LOC Venezuela  ] 's ports . 
[LOC Cuba  ] 's [LOC ASPORT  ] has a 49 percent share in Puertos del [ORG Alba  ] , a separate company , which will reportedly be focused on business development . 
Contacts in shipping circles , however , tell us that the [MISC Cubans  ] are active in the ports as " advisors " to [PER Bolipuertos  ] and were instrumental in pushing for the take over of port operations . 
[PER Bolipuertos  ] has taken over private warehouse operations at three ports named in the original March 25 Decree ( [LOC Guamache  ] , [LOC Maracaibo  ] , [LOC Puerto Cabello  ] ) as well as a fourth -- [ORG La Guaira  ] , the port serving [LOC Caracas  ] . 
Shipping contacts report rumors that the government may nationalize stevedoring and customs agent services . 
Insurance premiums have reportedly increased 35-40 percent since May . 
END SUMMARY . 
[PER BOLIPUERTOS  ] & PUERTOS DEL [ORG ALBA  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Post has clarified the issue of the management of [LOC Venezuela  ] 's ports . 
Two companies of virtually the same name have been decreed by the Government of the [LOC Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela  ] ( [ORG GBRV  ] ) . 
The first -- [ORG Bolivariana de Puertos S.A  ] . 
( [ORG BPSA  ] or [PER Bolipuertos  ] ) -- was founded by Decree on June 12 , 2007 . 
This company was to be a mixed [MISC Venezuelan-Cuban  ] company with [LOC Cuba  ] 's [PER Grupo Empresarial de la Industria Portuaria  ] ( [LOC ASPORT  ] ) having a 49 percent share . 
We understand that this first [PER Bolipuertos  ] was never actually registered as a company . 
The second [ORG Bolivariana  ] de [ORG Puertos  ] ( [ORG BP  ] or [PER Bolipuertos  ] ) was created by [ORG Decree No.  ] 6,645 dated March 25 , 2009 , to " maintain , administer and develop " [LOC Venezuela  ] 's ports . 
According to that [ORG Decree  ] , the [MISC Venezuelan  ] state holds 100 percent of the capital of the second [PER Bolipuertos  ] which was assigned to the Ministry for [ORG Public Works and Housing  ] . 
Neither of these companies is [ORG Puertos  ] del [ORG Alba  ] in which the [MISC Cubans  ] have a significant investment. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) On July 29 , 2009 , as reported reftel , the [ORG GBRV  ] published another [ORG Decree  ] in the [ORG National Gazette  ] authorizing the creation of [ORG Puertos  ] del [ORG Alba  ] , a state-owned company to be charged with " modernizing , renovating , equipping , and constructing " ports in [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] . 
[LOC Cuba  ] 's [LOC ASPORT  ] has a 49 percent share in [ORG Puertos  ] del [ORG Alba  ] with the 51 percent majority share remaining with [PER Bolipuertos  ] . 
A close Embassy contact tells us that the intent of the [ORG GBRV  ] is to " follow the [MISC Cuban  ] model " by installing a company ( [PER Bolipuertos  ] ) that will run all aspects of port operations in [LOC Venezuela  ] while [ORG Puertos  ] del [ORG Alba  ] will act as its business development arm . 
Other contacts assert that [PER Bolipuertos  ] retains [MISC Cuban  ] " advisors " on staff , but they do not believe that the [MISC Cubans  ] have formal managerial responsibility in the company . 
These advisors , however , are believed to have urged the [ORG GBRV  ] to move ahead with taking control of the ports. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The March 25 , 2009 , [ORG Decree  ] creating ( or re-creating ) [PER Bolipuertos  ] stipulated that it would be responsible for the infrastructure of [LOC Puerto El Guamache  ] ( the [PER Isla Marguerita  ] cruise ship port ) , [LOC Maracaibo Port  ] , [LOC Puerto Cabello  ] ( [LOC Venezuela  ] 's largest port ) , as well as that of " any ports to be developed in the future . 
" As reported reftels , a subsequent Decree dated July 30 , declared the immediate nationalization of private warehouse operations at the three ports named in the March 25 Decree as well as a fourth -- [ORG La Guaira  ] , the port serving [LOC Caracas  ] . 
Our contacts in the shipping industry tell us that it appears likely that [PER Bolipuertos  ] will also take control of port operations at [LOC Guanta  ] , [PER Palua/Puerto Ordaz  ] , [LOC Guiria  ] and [LOC Cumana  ] . 
PORT SERVICES STILL TROUBLED ---------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Operations in [LOC Puerto Cabello  ] were interrupted for four days following the take over of warehouse operations at the beginning of August . 
Reports of significant problems have continued since the resumption of operations . 
Former [ORG Petroleum Chamber  ] President [PER Andres Duarte  ] ( protect throughout ) informed Econoffs that his stevedore company has not been allowed to remove equipment from the port for maintenance or weekend storage in what many believe is a [LOC CARACAS  ] 00001181 002.2 OF 002 precursor to the expropriation of stevedoring and other terminal services . 
Another contact whose company provided warehouse services at [LOC Puerto Cabello  ] , directed Econoffs' attention to another company , [ORG Venezolana de Exportaciones  ] y [ORG Importaciones  ] , [ORG C.A  ] . 
( [ORG VEXINCA  ] ) , established by [ORG Decree No.  ] 38954 dated June 17 , 2008 . 
According to this contact , [ORG VEXINCA  ] , which is run by the military as are the ports at this point , is actively offering customs services to the clients of private sector customs agents . 
Our contact speculates that [ORG VEXINCA  ] may eventually be designated as the sole provider of customs services in [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
INSURANCE AND OTHER RISKS ------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Duarte  ] informed Econoffs that insurance premiums have increased 35-40 percent since the May 2009 announcement of the [ORG Marine Committee  ] of the [ORG Lloyd 's Market Association  ] that it had withdrawn maritime war-risk policy coverage for [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
Other local shipping contacts have confirmed a bulletin that ran in a [MISC British  ] shipping magazine in August noting that it may be difficult to make claims against [PER Bolipuertos  ] for robbery , damage etc . 
According to [PER Duarte  ] , [PER Norweigan  ] and [MISC Panamanian  ] owned ships that used to bring soda ash to [LOC Venezuela  ] have already been swapped out for older vessels with much smaller cargo capacity that cannot maintain the previous off-loading rate of 50,000 tons per day . 
[PER Duarte  ] also confirmed that the [ORG GBRV  ] will have to pay a higher premium on refrigerated shipping containers to [MISC European  ] and [MISC Brazilian  ] firms as [ORG Maersk  ] will no longer send them to [LOC Venezuela  ] as it has been unable to retrieve them in the past due to the chaos in the ports . 
It has also been reported that shipping line [ORG Hamburg Sud  ] will no longer serve [LOC Venezuela.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) COMMENT: Many observers note that decreased traffic arising from the global recession has saved [LOC Venezuela  ] 's ports from complete strangulation . 
The wilderness of stacked containers at the ports has improved . 
However , few here believe that the [ORG GBRV  ] has the know-how or the logistical experience to manage the ports even with the assistance of [MISC Cuban  ] advisors . 
There is speculation that some port operations may ultimately be handed over to friendly governments on a concessionary basis .
