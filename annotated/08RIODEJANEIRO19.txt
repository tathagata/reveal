( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: The [ORG US Commercial Service  ] in [LOC Rio  ] organized an oil roundtable discussion with [LOC US  ] oil companies and Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] on January 8 , 2008 . 
The [MISC CEOs  ] of [ORG Chevron  ] , [ORG Exxon Mobil  ] , [ORG Devon Energy  ] , [ORG Anadarko  ] , and [ORG Hess Corporation  ] briefed Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] on the investment climate for foreign players in [LOC Brazil  ] , prospects for future oil discoveries , and shared their views on the oil and gas regulatory and fiscal regimes . 
The participants believed the overall investment climate was positive for [LOC US  ] companies but obstacles included instability in the oil auctions and in the tax and licensing regimes . 
The Ambassador offered to advocate on behalf of the participants with [ORG GOB  ] officials and w ith the [ORG National Petroleum Agency  ] ( [ORG ANP  ] ) . 
The companies welcomed this idea and suggested emphasizing the need for stability to encourage investment . 
The Ambassador also proposed that the [ORG Brazilian Petroleum Institute  ] ( [ORG IBP  ] ) meet with relevant foreign ambassadors in [LOC Brazil  ] to discuss overall concerns . 
End of [LOC Summary.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] met with executives from [LOC US  ] oil companies operating in [LOC Brazil  ] on January 8 in a roundtable organized by the [ORG US Commercial Service  ] in [LOC Rio  ] and hosted by [ORG American Chamber of Commerce  ] President [PER Joao Cesar Lima  ] . 
Participants included [ORG Anadarko  ] President [PER Kurt McCaslin  ] ; [ORG Chevron Brasil  ] President [PER Daniel Rocha  ] and [ORG Business Development  ] and [ORG Government Relations  ] Director [PER Patricia Pradal  ] ; [ORG Devon Energy  ] President [PER Murilo Marroquim  ] ; [ORG Exxon Mobil  ] ( [ORG Esso  ] ) President [PER John Knapp  ] ; and [ORG Hess Brasil Exploration  ] Coordinator [PER Paul Gomes  ] and Negotiations and [ORG Business Manager  ] [PER Joseph Wesley  ] . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's Oil and Gas Potential ------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Ambassador Sobe l asked the participants for an overall description of the investment climate for [LOC US  ] companies in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Expressing the view of all present , [PER John Knapp  ] , President of [ORG Exxon Mobil  ] , confirmed that [ORG Exxon  ] had a great deal of interest in [LOC Brazil  ] because of perceived substantial undiscovered potential beyond even the [MISC Tupi  ] field that [ORG Petrobras  ] recently discovered . 
However , he expressed concern about the recent unstable investment environment caused by [LOC Rio State  ] tax changes , oil blocks being removed in the last two auctions , and the [ORG Government of Brazil  ] 's ( [ORG GOB  ] ) apparent willingness to change the oil concession contracts . 
He indicated that companies might begin to reassess the economic benefits of investing if there were continued instability . 
Changes in Oil Auctions ----------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Responding to Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] 's question on whether the oil blocks removed from the recent 9th oil licensing round would be made available for an upcoming auction , [PER Knapp  ] said that the [ORG GOB  ] had not yet made a decision . 
One of the justifications alleged by the [ORG GOB  ] for having removed those blocks was based on [MISC Petrobras'  ] statement that the [MISC Tupi  ] oilfield discovery brought a new exploration niche for [LOC Brazil  ] , thus reducing the exploration risk to find oil , with which [PER Knapp  ] did not agree . 
In his opinion , exploring under-salt areas presented significant geological and technical challenges . 
[ORG Devon Energy  ] 's President [PER Murilo Marroquim  ] added that [ORG Petrobras  ] had lied about the easy prospects of finding oil in under-salt areas due to the [LOC Tupi  ] discovery . 
He believed [ORG Petrobras  ] influenced the [ORG GOB  ] to remove the blocks from the 9th oil auction to avoid stiff competition with other bidders . 
[ORG Devon  ] asserted that [ORG Petrobras  ] did not have sufficient drilling equipment so had an interest in removing those blocks to allow more preparation time for it to bid for those blocks in future auctions. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Knapp  ] believed that the [ORG GOB  ] might reconsider the current oil auction model that is based on signature bonuses . 
[PER Marroquim  ] from [ORG Devon  ] did not seem so sure about drastic changes , and added that if substantial modifications to the current oil law were proposed , the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Congress  ] would need to approve them , which might take a long time . 
[PER Marroquim  ] believed that the [ORG GOB  ] might not want to take this route as it may have an unpredictable outcome . 
For example , he and others cited the new proposed gas bill that has been in [ORG Congress  ] for at least four years . 
[ORG Petrobras  ] has been advocating to protect its interests in gas infrastructure , but several amendments have been made to the gas bill that may , in the end , not favor [ORG Petrobras  ] . 
( Note: In a recent interview to the [ORG Folha  ] de [ORG Sco Paulo  ] newspaper , [ORG Petrobras  ] President [PER Gabrielli  ] cleared defended changes in future oil auctions . 
He views oil production sharing or service rendering contracts , where an oil company operates an oilfield and is financially compensated for that while the State keeps the oil field ownership , as bette r contract alternatives for [LOC Brazil  ] . 
) Advocacy through [ORG IBP  ] -------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] suggested that the [LOC US  ] companies engage other foreign [ORG Chambers of Commerce in Brazil  ] to advocate for their interests . 
[PER Marroquim  ] assured the Ambassador that they already work through the [ORG Brazilian Petroleum Institute  ] ( [ORG IBP  ] ) and noted that generally when politically sensitive topics were discussed at [ORG IBP  ] meetings , [ORG Petrobras  ] officials tended not to participate as actively . 
Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] also suggested that the [ORG IBP  ] organize a meeting with foreign Ambassadors in [LOC Brazil  ] to have an open dialogue about the sector 's issues . 
[ORG Chevron Business Development  ] and [ORG Government Relations  ] Director [PER Patricia Pradal  ] , who sits on the [ORG IBP Steering Group  ] , expressed an interest in coordinating such a roundtable . 
Additionally , [ORG Rio American Chamber of Commerce  ] ( [ORG AmCham  ] ) President [PER Joco Lima  ] mentioned that some state governors seemed interested in a roundtable with the [MISC AmC  ] hams , which Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] found interesting due to the political clout it may give to the oil industry. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Marroquim  ] further commented that in December 2007 , right after the 9th oil auction , the [ORG IBP  ] met with the [ORG National Oil Regulatory Agency  ] ( [ORG ANP  ] ) to voice the oil industry 's concern about possible changes in the oil law . 
The [ORG ANP  ] General Director reportedly told [ORG IBP  ] that the [ORG GOB  ] might want to review current oil royalty and special participation fee levels . 
( Note: The latter refers to payment due on oil and natural gas exploration and production in the case of high volume or high profit margin fields . 
The basis for calculating the special participation fees is net revenue from quarterly production from each field after the legally permitted deductions . 
The percentage rates vary from 10 to 40% . 
) If these fee changes are made , [ORG IBP  ] believes there will be no need to pass them by [ORG Congress  ] . 
[ORG Anadarko  ] 's President [PER Kurt McCaslin  ] said that oil royalties were in place in the [MISC Gul  ] f of [LOC Mexico  ] , but special participation fees were not . 
[PER McCaslin  ] emphasized that indirect taxes in [LOC Brazil  ] , in general , were a burden for foreign investors . 
Partnership with [ORG Petrobras  ] -------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) All [LOC US  ] companies present at the oil roundtable confirmed that they are partnered with [ORG Petrobras  ] in some capacity . 
For example , [ORG Devon  ] holds nine oil concessions in [LOC Brazil  ] , three of which are in partnership with [ORG Petrobras  ] . 
[ORG Anadarko  ] is partnered with [ORG Petrobras  ] in four out of ten oil concessions . 
[ORG Chevron  ] is currently developing the [MISC Frade  ] oil field with [ORG Petrobras  ] . 
[ORG Hess  ] has one block in partnership with [ORG Petrobras  ] and [ORG Exxon  ] , the latter as the field operator. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER McCaslin  ] stressed that [ORG Petrobras  ] owned oil and gas infrastructure in [LOC Brazil  ] , but being a partner with [ORG Petrobras  ] did not mean one would have automatic access to the facilities . 
[PER Marroquim  ] stated that if one produced natural gas , it had to sell to [ORG Petrobras  ] . 
On the other hand , oil offshore production did not depend as much on [MISC Petrobras'  ] infrastructure , making exports from [LOC Brazil  ] an easy process . 
[PER Knapp  ] explained that it was strictly a business decision if a company wanted to work with [ORG Petrobras  ] . 
Sometimes it made more sense to work independently . 
In this regard , [LOC Brazil  ] could be considered an open oil market . 
" More and more companies now have acreage where [ORG Petrobras  ] is not a partner . 
" A good example of companies not partnered with [ORG Petrobras  ] was the case of new oil player [ORG OGX  ] , owned by a large [MISC Brazilian  ] mining company [ORG EBX  ] and investor [PER Eike Batista  ] . 
In the most recent oil round , [ORG OGX  ] presented the highest bids for seven blocks with strong potential in the offshore [LOC Campos  ] basin . 
OBX spent more than 1.4 billion reais ( [MISC US$754  ] million ) , which was more than 70% of the total for the entire round . 
[PER Batista  ] was able to attract a team of former [ORG Petrobras  ] officials to work at [ORG OGX  ] , including [PER Francisco Gros  ] , ex-President of [ORG Petrobras  ] ; [PER Paulo Mendonga  ] , ex-Executive Manager of E&P of [ORG Petrobras  ] ; and [PER Luis Reis  ] , ex-Petrobras Contract Manager . 
[ORG GOB  ] to Limit Oil Exports from [LOC Brazil  ] ? ------------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Another regulatory risk cited in the roundtable was that the [ORG GOB  ] might restrict oil exports if [ORG Petrobras  ] delayed domestic ( e.g . 
[MISC Tupi  ] ) oil production . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] oil law allows for this possibility in case of oil shortage and energy security interests . 
[PER McCaslin  ] worried that oil shortages caused by delayed production might lead to instability in government and a subsequent change in oil laws requiring foreign companies to sell to [ORG Petrobras  ] . 
[ORG Hess Corporation Oil Exploration  ] Coordinator [PER Paulo Otvio Gomes  ] did not foresee any technological barriers that would inhibit [ORG Petrobras  ] developing the [MISC Tupi  ] field . 
[PER Gomes  ] cited [MISC Petrobras'  ] advanced technological research center as an important tool to give all the technological support [ORG Petrobras  ] would need . 
He himself led a key [MISC Petrobras'  ] project when he worked there aimed at the geological evaluation of the und er-salt section of the [LOC Santos Basin  ] , including the [MISC Tupi  ] and " [MISC Sugar Loaf  ] " deepwater areas between 1999 and 2001 . 
[PER Gomes  ] believed there were further discoveries adjacent to [MISC Tupi  ] . 
He hoped these fields would be offered in a competitive auction so [ORG Hess  ] could participate . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's Gas Needs ------------------ <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The participants agreed that [ORG Petrobras  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] 's government oil company [ORG PDVSA  ] joint projects were aimed at increasing [LOC Brazil  ] 's heavy oil refining capacity , but [PER Marroquim  ] did not believe that the planned mega gas pipeline from [LOC Venezuela  ] to [LOC Brazil  ] would materialize since [ORG Petrobras  ] is bringing liquefied natural gas ( [ORG LNG  ] ) plants to [LOC Brazil  ] instead . 
None of the [LOC US  ] oil companies are partnered with [ORG Petrobras  ] in this new [ORG LNG  ] business in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
In [PER Marroquim  ] 's opinion , [LOC Brazil  ] was being forced to invest in [LOC Bolivia  ] to produce more gas . 
There is pressure for [ORG Petrobras  ] to supply enough gas to fire the natural gas power plants because of low hy dropower reservoir levels and possible power shortages . 
( Note: Although [ORG Petrobras  ] owns the majority of domestic gas-fired power plants , a predominant share of [LOC Brazil  ] 's energy comes from hydropower ( 81.2% ) ) . 
Taxation Problems ----------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) When asked about the status of changes to [LOC Rio State  ] 's [MISC VAT  ] ( " ICMS " ) tax on oil equipment , [PER Patricia Pradal  ] from [ORG Chevron  ] provided a quick background on the temporary admission regime ( [ORG REPETRO  ] ) that the Federal government created in 1999 . 
[ORG REPETRO  ] exempted from federal taxes the importation of some of the equipment used by the oil and gas exploration and production industry . 
Since then , some states , particularly [LOC Rio  ] , have made some changes that increased the states' [MISC VAT  ] tax . 
( Note: About 85% of the oil produced in [LOC Brazil  ] comes from the state of [LOC Rio  ] . 
However , the [MISC VAT  ] tax on the oil produced goes to the states where the oil is refined , mainly [PER Sco Paulo  ] which has four refineries . 
This has created a feeling of inequity . 
) [PER Pradal  ] said th at the most recent development to the [MISC VAT  ] tax was a counter-proposal made by [ORG IBP  ] where [LOC Rio State  ] would tax 5% with future credits , or , alternatively , 2% without credit . 
The [ORG Rio State Finance  ] Secretary [PER Joaquim Levy  ] is considering a 3 to 7% alternative. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The participants welcomed Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] 's advocacy offer with [PER Levy  ] and suggested that the Ambassador convey to him a message on the need for tax stability . 
As the oil industry 's high investments are only recovered long-term , it was crucial that they invest under a stable tax regime . 
Licensing Complaints -------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) When the Ambassador asked how relations were with [LOC Brazil  ] 's environmental licensing organization [ORG IBAMA  ] , several participants lamented the wait time on approvals and suggested that [ORG IBAMA  ] 's personnel could benefit from training offered by other countries , as Padral noted [ORG USG  ] officials had done before . 
[PER McCaslin  ] said , " It does not matter when you need the permit , they will approve it two we eks before . 
" Advocacy through Upcoming [ORG USG Visitors  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] cited the upcoming visits to [LOC Brazil  ] of Energy Secretary [PER Bodman  ] and other [MISC VIPs  ] as opportunities to engage [ORG GOB  ] officials on areas of concern . 
He also welcomed talking points for his upcoming meeting with [ORG ANP  ] and suggested another oil roundtable with Secretary [PER Bodman  ] during his visit . 
( Note: CS Rio has scheduled a meeting with [ORG ANP  ] for February 15 . 
) Regarding the meeting with [ORG ANP  ] , [PER Gomes  ] added that conveying the importance of having a 10th round in 2008 would be appreciated. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Chevron  ] President [PER Daniel Rocha  ] noted that he was impressed with [ORG ANP  ] 's efficiency during the 9th oil auction and he hoped that [ORG ANP  ] would preserve that system as it was a cornerstone for oil investment in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
He added that the [ORG ANP  ] had strong credibility and a good reputation for respecting contract sanctity . 
[PER Rocha  ] further stated that as [ORG Petrobras  ] had recently been able to win a lio n 's share of blocks in the [LOC Gulf  ] of [LOC Mexico  ] , [ORG ANP  ] should see that [LOC Brazil  ] continued to benefit from foreign investment . 
Comment ------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Although our interlocutors complained of [LOC Brazil  ] 's somewhat inadequate climate for foreign investment due to tax instability , possible regulatory framework changes , and [MISC Petrobras'  ] dominance and influence over regulatory issues , all oil roundtable participants seemed interested in remaining in [LOC Brazil  ] due to good geological prospects to find oil and gas , and a more reliable investment and business environment than many other countries . 
A new [MISC Brazilian  ] Minister of Mines and Energy recently assumed office . 
He will be faced primarily with ways to avoid power shortage in 2008 and 2009 . 
Some directors at [ORG Petrobras  ] are also expected to change due to political pressure from opposition parties . 
It remains to be seen how these changes may impact [LOC Brazil  ] 's oil sector , especially regarding future oil auctions . 
This cabl e has been cleared with [ORG Embassy Brasilia  ] .
