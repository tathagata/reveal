( C ) Summary: [MISC Russian  ] foreign policy continues to irritate and puzzle the Government of [LOC Iceland  ] . 
In the hour-long special on [LOC Russia  ] , broadcasted by an [MISC Icelandic  ] television channel on January 15 , [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador [PER Tatarintsev  ] claimed that recent [MISC Russian  ] foreign policy moves are tied to [LOC Russia  ] 's desire for a multipolar world , a notion threatening to " [MISC American  ] military and political circles that want to dictate their political will to everybody else , and we [MISC Russians  ] will never allow it . 
" The Ambassador 's remarks did not win any fans at the [ORG Icelandic Ministry for Foreign Affairs  ] , particularly when [PER Tatarintsev  ] accused the Government of [LOC Iceland  ] of " hanky panky " in unfairly excluding [MISC Russian  ] manufacturer [ORG Kazan  ] from procurement of new search and rescue helicopters for the [ORG Coast Guard  ] here . 
While the [MISC Russian  ] Embassy here may be pleased for having aired their point of view , they may have miscalculated just how poorly received it would be among the government and public . 
END SUMMARY . 
[MISC Russian  ] Public Diplomacy: Not Quite Warm and Fuzzy --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Icelandic  ] TV Channel 2 devoted its hour-long newsmagazine " [MISC Compass  ] " on January 15 to [MISC Russian  ] foreign policy , both in a global sense and regarding [LOC Iceland  ] in particular . 
The first segment of the show focused on the resumption of long-range aviation ( [ORG LRA  ] ) activity by [LOC Russia  ] beginning in the summer of 2007 ( Ref A ) and centered on the visit of the [MISC Compass  ] crew to [LOC Engels Air Base  ] in [LOC Russia  ] , where most of the recent [ORG LRA  ] flights near [LOC Iceland  ] have originated . 
( [MISC Note: Though Compass  ] noted that the [MISC Russian  ] Embassy facilitated their crew 's travel to [LOC Engels  ] as well as to the [ORG Kazan  ] helicopter manufacturing plant ( para . 
4 ) , the assumption here is that the trip was largely [MISC Russian-funded  ] . 
[MISC Compass  ] and Channel 2 are " flat broke , " in the words of one local media commentator . 
End Note . 
) During the visit , bomber crews spoke in glowing terms of [LOC Iceland  ] 's beauty , which they noted during their circumnavigations of the island . 
The crews also downplayed any threat to [LOC Iceland  ] from the flights , and avoided any direct answer to concerns raised here regarding any possible danger to civil aviation. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The show 's second portion turned to the broader question of recent [MISC Russian  ] activities on the global stage , and how President [PER Putin  ] plays at home and abroad . 
The segment gave [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador to [LOC Iceland  ] [PER Viktor Tatarintsev  ] ample speaking room . 
In his most provocative comments , [PER Tatarintsev  ] opined: " What we are advocating for is to have a multipolar world...there will not be any superpower that thinks it can do whatever it wants to with everybody else as its smaller servants . 
It will not be that way and the [MISC Americans  ] know that . 
Therefore , they are concerned with the growing power of [LOC Russia  ] , and we will become much stronger . 
It is a real threat to [MISC Americans  ] , not the [MISC American  ] population , but a threat to [MISC American  ] military and political circles that want to dictate their political will to everybody else , and we [MISC Russians  ] will never allow it . 
It is pretty simple and it is as simple as that . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The show wrapped up with a lengthy explication of the [ORG Icelandic Coast Guard  ] 's ( ICG ) [ORG SAR  ] helicopter procurement efforts . 
Starting in summer 2006 ( Ref B ) , [PER Tatarintsev  ] has repeatedly claimed that the Government of [LOC Iceland  ] has unnecessarily shunned [MISC Russian  ] offers to present [ORG Kazan  ] 's [ORG MI-172  ] helicopter as an option for the ICG . 
The [MISC Compass  ] crew traveled to [ORG Kazan  ] 's manufacturing facility in [LOC Tatarstan  ] , and after devoting considerable screen time to the [ORG MI-172  ] 's capabilities and its advocates , concludes that the aircraft would not meet ICG needs as well as other options on the table . 
Nonetheless , [PER Tatarintsev  ] complained that his embassy has never received a written reply to [ORG GOR  ] offers of assistance and dismissed [MISC MFA  ] responses that answers were provided orally . 
Terming the handling of [ORG Kazan  ] 's offer and the recent Iceland-Norway agreement to pursue a joint [ORG SAR  ] helo procurement plan " hanky-panky , " [PER Tatarintsev  ] closed the program with the pledge that [LOC Russia  ] " will not allow " such discrimination to go forward . 
Icelanders Not Impressed ------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In a January 16 meeting on an unrelated matter , [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG MFA Permanent  ] Secretary [PER Gretar Mar Sigurdsson  ] told the Ambassador that he had repeatedly discussed the [ORG SAR  ] helicopter issue with the [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador and was greately irritated by [PER Tatarintsev  ] 's claim that the [MISC MFA  ] had not answered the mail . 
[PER Sigurdsson  ] further noted that he found [PER Tatarintsev  ] 's explanation about [MISC Russian  ] foreign policy neither comforting nor convincing . 
Separately , [MISC MFA  ] contacts have mentioned to Pol Chief their bewilderment at both the aims of the [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador 's TV appearance as well as [MISC Russian  ] goals in general. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Comment: When [PER Tatarintsev  ] took up his posting here in summer 2006 , he made a point in several interviews of mentioning his love of Reykjavik 's swimming pools and other [MISC Icelandic  ] cultural touchstones , leading many to believe this was a " new kind of [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador . 
" With his comments to the press on the [ORG LRA  ] resumption in August 2006 ( " These flights are just something that Icelanders will have to get used to , " ) and in the January 15 [MISC Compass  ] episode , many here now believe [LOC Russia  ] and her envoy are again showing their true colors . 
[MISC Icelandic  ] anxiety over [MISC Russian  ] intentions worldwide and in the [MISC North Atlantic  ] neighborhood will continue to grow , translating directly into greater interest in robust defense and security ties with the [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG NATO  ] .
