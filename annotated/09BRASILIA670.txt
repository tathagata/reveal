Reason: 1.4 ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: [MISC Brazilian  ] Ministry for [ORG External Relations  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) Director for [ORG International Organizations Carlos Duarte  ] characterized [LOC Cuba  ] as the dominant issue for the upcoming [ORG OAS General Assembly  ] ( [ORG OASGA  ] ) . 
[LOC Brazil  ] sees a resolution on [LOC Cuba  ] as inevitable , he said , but will try to play a moderating role on the issue . 
[PER Duarte  ] confirmed that FM [PER Celso Amorim  ] plans to attend the [ORG OASGA  ] . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Duarte  ] and [ORG OAS  ] chief [PER Luciano Rego  ] , both of whome will attend the [ORG OASGA  ] , told [MISC Poloffs  ] May 26 that , with almost all other resolutions finished , [LOC Cuba  ] was the focus of the final week of preparation . 
[PER Duarte  ] hoped that some sort of [LOC Cuba  ] resolution could be agreed prior to the [ORG OASGA  ] start on June 2 , so as to " avoid polarization . 
" He said that [LOC Brazil  ] was working in the [MISC Latin American Association  ] for Integration ( ALADI ) to achieve a common position on language for a resolution regarding the lifting of the 1962 suspension of [LOC Cuba  ] from the [ORG OAS  ] , but he noted that some states wanted to be " more aggressive than others , " and no consensus had been achieved yet within [LOC ALADI.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) According to [PER Duarte  ] , [LOC U.S.  ] ideas presented to [ORG OAS  ] Ambassadors over thee past weekend allowed " scope for agreement " on a text before the [ORG OASGA  ] . 
[PER Duarte  ] added that a recent letter from former President [PER Carter  ] and the Friends of the [ORG Inter-American Democratic Charter  ] , had provided significant support to the views expressed by [ORG USG  ] officials regarding the importance of respecting the [MISC IADC.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Noting the June 1 inauguration of new [MISC Salvadoran  ] President [PER Funes  ] that will bring together a number of key regional leaders , including President [PER Lula  ] , [PER Duarte  ] said he understood that [MISC Paraguayan  ] President [PER Lugo  ] and [MISC Nicaraguan  ] President [PER Ortega  ] planned to attend the [ORG OASGA  ] , as well . 
As a result , even agreement of a draft document this week would not guarantee the [LOC Cuba  ] issue would not be reopened at the [ORG OASGA  ] . 
[PER Duarte  ] said that [LOC Brazil  ] will continue to try to play a moderating role in the discussions. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Duarte  ] admitted that the [ORG GOB  ] has received " unclear signs " from [LOC Cuba  ] on the issue , with the formal government , often at odds with former President [PER Fidel Castro  ] . 
Nonetheless , it was clear that [LOC Cuba  ] 's entire focus was on ending the [LOC U.S.  ] embargo , and that everything else was secondary . 
Despite the lack of enthusiasm from [LOC Havana  ] , [PER Duarte  ] indicated that [LOC Brazil  ] supports a resolution pointing toward [LOC Cuba  ] 's reintegration with the [LOC OAS.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) When asked what issues from the recent [ORG Summit  ] of the [ORG Americas  ] ( [ORG SOA  ] ) would be important for the [ORG OASGA  ] , [PER Duarte  ] said that in the [ORG GOB  ] 's view , the two main issues from the [ORG SOA  ] were not on the agenda: [LOC Cuba  ] and the economic crisis . 
All other specific [ORG SOA  ] issues were being worked out in their appropriate ways , although he noted that the [ORG Bolivarian Alternative  ] ( [ORG ALBA  ] ) countries were insisting on footnoting their disagreement with any resolution that mentioned the [ORG SOA  ] declaration . 
In [PER Duarte  ] 's view , the key objective for the [ORG OASGA  ] was to " preserve the spirit and positive momentum " from the [ORG Summit  ] , which he attributed to President [PER Obama  ] 's positions and participation . 
Key to accomplishing this would be further symbolic progress on [LOC Cuba  ] , rather than concrete steps on any of the concrete elements of the hemispheric agenda. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Comment: [LOC Brazil  ] has made clear that it believes [LOC Cuba  ] should be re-integrated into the inter-American system , but is genuinely committed to ensuring the issue does not become polemical at the [ORG OASGA  ] . 
In discussing the Administration , s efforts to move forward on [LOC Cuba  ] , it appeared that [PER Duarte  ] , like many of our [MISC Brazilian  ] contacts , was unaware of the complex [LOC U.S.  ] domestic dynamic that must be addressed . 
It will be important for [ORG GOB  ] interlocutors to understand this dynamic as [LOC Brazil  ] seeks to play a moderating role on [LOC Cuba  ] .
