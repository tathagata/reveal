Media were present during [MISC Saudabayev’s  ] welcoming remarks , but left after five minutes . 
A WARM WELCOME FOR AN OLD FRIEND <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Saudabayev  ] warmly welcomed [ORG SRAP  ] [PER Holbrooke  ] back to [LOC Kazakhstan  ] , and said that [LOC Kazakhstan  ] is grateful for the strategic vision , leadership , and advice the [LOC United States  ] has provided to bring stability to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
He stressed that [LOC Kazakhstan  ] has been and will remain a “trusted and strategic partner” of the [LOC United States  ] , and has stood by the [LOC United States  ] ever since the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) After the press left the room , [PER SRAP Holbrooke  ] told [PER Saudabayev  ] that [LOC Kazakhstan  ] is “the most important country in the region , ” expressed admiration for President Nazarbayev’s achievements since independence in 1991 , and asked [PER Saudabayev  ] to convey his personal regards to [PER Nazarbayev  ] , who was out of town . 
A UNIQUE ROLE TO PLAY <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Holbrooke  ] told [PER Saudabayev  ] that -- as Chairman-in-Office of the [ORG OSCE  ] -- [LOC Kazakhstan  ] has a “unique role to play this year in world affairs.” He said he appreciated [MISC Kazakhstan’s  ] focus on stability in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and told [PER Saudabayev  ] that the situation is “at a very critical moment.” He noted that the [LOC United States  ] was tripling the number of troops from 31,000 to 100,000 since January 2009 , and hadtripled the number of civilians in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] said the [LOC United States  ] would welcome [LOC Kazakhstan  ] becoming more involved in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and said that [LOC Kazakhstan  ] could share its expertise with [LOC Afghanistan  ] in police training and agriculture , for example . 
[MISC NORTH-SOUTH  ] POLAR-ROUTE OVERFLIGHTS <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) To support operations in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Holbrooke  ] reminded [PER Saudabayev  ] that the [LOC United States  ] has requested [MISC Kazakhstan’s  ] agreement on [MISC North-South  ] polar-route overflights and rail transportation of wheeled and armored but not weaponized military vehicles . 
[PER Saudabayev  ] responded that the government plans to present the [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy its draft agreement on [MISC North-South  ] polar-route overflights by the end of the week of February 22 . 
He said he did not expect it would take the [LOC United States  ] long to review and approve the agreement , since it is based on an existing agreement with [LOC Russia  ] . 
[PER Saudabayev  ] said he expected to be able to finalize and sign the agreement in March , before President [PER Nazarbayev  ] departs for the [ORG Nuclear Security Summit  ] in [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC DC  ] , on April 12-13 . 
[PER Saudabayev  ] also said that he expects the [MISC North-South  ] polar-route overflight agreement to “clear the way” for an agreement on the ground transportation of armored military vehicles. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Saudabayev  ] added that President [PER Nazarbayev  ] strongly supports the [MISC President’s  ] strategy in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , particularly the increase in troop levels , and the transfer of greater responsibility and accountability to the government of [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Saudabayev  ] told [PER Holbrooke  ] that [LOC Afghanistan  ] is the “most serious problem” facing [LOC Kazakhstan  ] at the moment and promised , “We will stand with you to resolve the situation , because it affects the security and stability of our region.” SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN [LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Saudabayev  ] said [LOC Kazakhstan  ] welcomes the [LOC U.S.  ] objective to make the transition from military operations to sustainable humanitarian and social development through investments in infrastructure and education . 
[PER Saudabayev  ] noted that [LOC Kazakhstan  ] itself will provide $50 million for an education program and he introduced a [MISC Kazakh  ] [ORG SRAP  ] , [PER Bitimov  ] , whom he said has worked on [LOC Afghanistan  ] for 30 years , “speaks the language , ” and understands the mentality and culture of the [MISC Afghan  ] people . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] said he was pleased by the appointment of Special Representative [PER Bitimov  ] and invited him to visit [LOC Washington  ] to discuss coordination efforts in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
THE [PER ZHOVTIS  ] CASE <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Holbrooke  ] told [PER Saudabayev  ] that the imprisonment of human rights activist [PER Yevgeniy Zhovtis  ] is one of the pressing issues affecting [MISC Kazakhstan’s  ] bilateral relationship with the [LOC United States  ] . 
He told [PER Saudabayev  ] that [PER Zhovtis  ] has become a symbol for the opposition in [LOC Kazakhstan  ] , “a fact that he certainly understands and exploits.” [PER Holbrooke  ] said that if [PER Zhovtis  ] could be released by presidential pardon , that would reduce his symbolic value , since “he is worth less to the opposition out of jail than in jail.” <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) On [PER Zhovtis  ] , [PER Saudabayev  ] agreed that “neither you nor we need this problem.” But he said that this is an issue of principle. “We must respect the independence of our judicial system , ” he said. “If we make an exception to the law for [PER Zhovtis  ] , ” he claimed , “then 200 others with similar sentences will demand to be released from prison as well . 
They are watching to see if the government of [LOC Kazakhstan  ] will be pressured into releasing Zhovtis.” He also said that as a human rights activist , “Zhovtis never came under any political pressure” to cease his activities . 
[PER Saudabayev  ] said that [PER Zhovtis  ] unfortunately killed a man , was tried and sentenced by a court of law , and now must serve his four-year sentence . 
According to [PER Saudabayev  ] , “the law worked exactly the way it was designed.” <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Saudabayev  ] observed that the “unprecedented pressure” being placed on [LOC Kazakhstan  ] as a result of the [PER Zhovtis  ] conviction is “not viewed positively in our society.” He acknowledged that the “only legitimate way out” for [PER Zhovtis  ] would be via presidential pardon , but said , “that is the prerogative of our president.” Attempting to draw a parallel , [PER Saudabayev  ] added that he admired the “persistence” of the [LOC U.S.  ] judicial system in its persistent attempts to get film director [PER Roman Polanski  ] , “even though he was forgiven by the victim.” [PER Holbrooke  ] took strong exception , noting that [PER Polanski  ] fled justice , escaped the law , and has been living free despite his conviction by a [LOC U.S.  ] court . 
REQUEST FOR A BILATERAL MEETING <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Holbrooke  ] said he was hopeful that bilateral meeting between President [PER Obama  ] and President [PER Nazarbayev  ] could be arranged in April . 
[ORG NSC  ] Director [PER Donnelly  ] confirmed that the [LOC White House  ] is considering a possible bilateral meeting . 
He noted that [ORG NSC  ] Director [PER McFaul  ] might visit [LOC Kazakhstan  ] in the near future for further discussion on this issue , but that no decision has been made . 
[ORG OSCE  ] SUMMIT IN 2010 <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) On the subject of an [ORG OSCE Summit  ] in 2010 , [PER Saudabayev  ] asked [PER Holbrooke  ] to convey his thanks and warmest regards to the Secretary of State for their “instrumental and helpful” meeting on February 4 in [LOC Washington  ] . 
He said he was grateful to have [LOC U.S.  ] support for holding the [ORG Summit  ] , and noted that [LOC Afghanistan  ] would certainly be a major item on the agenda . 
[ORG SRAP  ] [PER Holbrooke  ] told [PER Saudabayev  ] that , “we will make certain that the [LOC United States  ] is represented at the appropriate level.” While [PER Holbrooke  ] promised to advocate personally for the meetings that [LOC Kazakhstan  ] has requested , since they would serve the interests of both countries , resolution of other issues such as [MISC North-South  ] polar overflights , ground transportation of military vehicles , and [PER Zhovtis  ] , would greatly facilitate positive decisions in [LOC Washington.  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Ambassador [PER Holbrooke  ] cleared this cable .
