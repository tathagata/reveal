Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . 
SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [LOC United States  ] and [LOC China  ] share important and growing political and economic interests that will bind us indefinitely , despite frictions . 
Where interests vary or compete , we share a common interest in managing our differences . 
In the medium term , [LOC China  ] 's core foreign policy goals -- securing access to energy supplies and maintaining a stable international environment in order to pursue domestic economic development -- will keep [LOC China  ] as a status quo power . 
Over time , [LOC China  ] 's growing strength will lead to a foreign policy more willing to confront the [LOC United States  ] but also better able to take up the responsibilities of a global stakeholder . 
[LOC China  ] will continue to demand more from the [LOC United States  ] on [LOC Taiwan  ] than we are willing to give , and [LOC Taiwan  ] will remain a potential flashpoint . 
As we face an increasingly self-confident and powerful [LOC China  ] , we can and should continue to use bilateral policy instruments , including high-level engagement ( such as the [ORG Senior Dialogue  ] and [ORG Strategic Economic Dialogue  ] ) , [LOC China  ] 's multilateral commitments , and the [MISC Chinese  ] desire to build its international image and standing to protect [LOC U.S.  ] interests , spur positive change in [LOC China  ] and increase [LOC Beijing  ] 's stake in international institutions and its adherence to international norms . 
End Summary . 
ECONOMIC TIES THAT BIND ----------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The [LOC United States  ] and [LOC China  ] share enormous economic interests . 
[LOC China  ] is the top [LOC U.S.  ] trade partner outside of [LOC North America  ] , and public and private sector analysts agree that [LOC China  ] 's share of our trade will continue to rise . 
Exports have been a primary driver of [LOC China  ] 's growth . 
Export-oriented employment , along with technology transfers and other indirect benefits of foreign investment and trade , are major ingredients of [LOC China  ] 's economic miracle . 
Similarly , low inflation and strong growth in the [LOC United States  ] over the last two decades stem in part from low-cost [MISC Chinese  ] imports and financial inflows . 
It is in the interests of both the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC China  ] to maintain the benefits created by our complementary economies while correcting current imbalances by continuing to pressure [LOC China  ] to open markets , particularly in the service sector , and to significantly improve the protection of intellectual property rights . 
At the same time , frictions need to be managed carefully to avoid harming our common economic interests . 
POLITICAL COOPERATION --------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Shared overall [MISC U.S.-China  ] interests in peace , security and prosperity likewise are dogged by frictions . 
Differences over values , political systems , specific goals and means will continue . 
The list of areas of political and security friction is long and includes [LOC China  ] 's authoritarian political system , [LOC China  ] 's support for unsavory regimes , [LOC China  ] 's breakneck military modernization , [LOC China  ] 's paranoid fear that the [LOC United States  ] secretly promotes regime change and " separatists " in [LOC Taiwan  ] , [LOC Tibet  ] and [LOC Xinjiang  ] , growing nationalism and the sense in some quarters in both [LOC Washington  ] and [LOC Beijing  ] that the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC China  ] are commencing a long-term struggle for global political , economic and military supremacy . 
Countering these differences is the buildup of mutual trust between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Chinese  ] leadership and the willingness to work together in an increasingly broad spectrum of common strategic interests . 
[LOC China  ] 's realization of its own interest in a stable , non-nuclear [ORG Korean Peninsula  ] and frustration with an inept [MISC North Korean  ] leadership seemingly incapable of creating an economy that can sustainably support its own people , leading to constant refugee outflows , has led to close cooperation with the [LOC United States  ] in the [MISC Six-Party Talks  ] . 
The evolution in [LOC China  ] 's position on [LOC Darfur  ] , driven by the [MISC Olympics-related  ] international publicity concerning [LOC China  ] 's role in abetting genocide , shows that extreme diplomatic and public pressure can redirect [MISC Chinese  ] policy to a degree . 
[LOC China  ] 's cooperation on [LOC Burma  ] and [LOC Iran  ] has been grudging and limited , but real . 
We have been able to leverage [LOC China  ] 's growing interdependence and concern for its global public image into support for multilateral actions that further [LOC U.S.  ] goals . 
FAMILIARITY BREEDS FRICTION --------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The expanding breadth , scale and intensity of [MISC U.S.-China  ] engagement bring additional opportunities for friction as well as cooperation . 
[LOC China  ] 's gradual approach to exchange rate flexibility , slowness on further trade liberalization , weak IPR protection and other barriers to trade and investment require constant attention . 
[LOC China  ] 's perception that [LOC U.S.  ] assertiveness on WTO commitments , import regulation , investment cases and product safety is discriminatory requires education and explanation . 
Such frictions could become more acute should the economy worsen , protectionism rise , or sensitivity [LOC BEIJING  ] 00000661 002 OF 004 over foreign investment sharpen in either country . 
Politically , differing assessments on the urgency of issues like [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program and appropriate tactics to realize shared strategic goals will mean [LOC China  ] and the [LOC United States  ] continue to butt heads diplomatically . 
Divergent views on democracy and human rights will continue to be a sore point in the bilateral relationship . 
Managing day-to-day frictions with an eye to larger interests will be the greatest challenge for policy-makers . 
[ORG RHETORIC: STRATEGIC REBALANCING  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [LOC China  ] 's rise and emergence as a global power is a powerful and popular theme in [MISC Chinese  ] contemporary culture , with hundreds of books , major TV series , countless media articles and academic studies devoted to it . 
Official public statements on foreign policy stress " democratization of international relations " and a more " multi-polar " world , contrasted with [LOC U.S  ] . 
" unilateralism . 
" Many scholars , officials and ordinary citizens believe [LOC China  ] 's past weakness has forced it to endure " injustices " from the [LOC United States  ] , like the [MISC Taiwan Relations Act  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] arms sales to [LOC Taiwan  ] , and [MISC Chinese  ] have no trouble linking these injustices to a centuries-long string of humiliations [LOC China  ] perceives itself as having suffered at the hands of foreign powers . 
MFA officials often complain informally ( and unfairly ) that the [LOC United States  ] demands [LOC China  ] address [LOC U.S.  ] concerns while ignoring [LOC China  ] 's concerns . 
As [LOC China  ] 's international presence and nationalist sentiment grow , commensurate with greater political , economic and military might , [MISC Chinese  ] analysts anticipate a more assertive [MISC Chinese  ] foreign policy and a greater readiness to confront the [LOC United States  ] . 
REALITY: STATUS QUO POWER ------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Despite the flag-waving " rising [LOC China  ] " theme in popular culture and official media promising a more assertive [MISC Chinese  ] international stance , the reality of [LOC China  ] 's foreign policy for at least the next five years is that [LOC China  ] is committed to the international status quo as it reaps the benefits of [MISC U.S.-policed  ] globalization . 
President [PER Hu  ] 's " [MISC Harmonious World  ] " foreign policy , officially sanctified at the [ORG 17th Party Congress  ] in October , explicitly endorses the existing world order and declares that [LOC China  ] 's interest is in maintaining a stable international environment where it can pursue domestic economic and social development goals . 
[LOC China  ] 's foreign policy leaders take great pains to highlight [LOC China  ] 's " developing country " status as a way to offset international calls for [LOC China  ] to play a more significant international role , and to expend more material and political resources , commensurate with its " emerging power " status . 
In January , Executive Vice Foreign Minister [PER Dai Bingguo  ] held the fifth session of the [MISC U.S.-China Senior Dialogue  ] in his poor rural home province of [LOC Guizhou  ] rather than [LOC Beijing  ] to make the point that [LOC China  ] remains poor and is confronted with economic development challenges on a large scale . 
Continued access to energy supplies and raw materials on the international market is essential to [LOC China  ] 's continued economic growth , which means continued reliance on global peace and stability and the existing global security system to protect such shipments . 
As [MISC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [MISC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , " when it comes to the basic [MISC Chines  ] interest in securing energy supplies and raw materials for our economic growth , free-riderism works for us right now . 
" IRRESPONSIBLE STAKEHOLDER ? ------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Internal debate continues in [LOC China  ] regarding its appropriate international role . 
Some foreign policy figures argue [LOC China  ] should seize opportunities to lead on global issues like climate change , nonproliferation and mediation of international disputes . 
Contacts have said these remarks reflect internal government debates on balancing global with purely national interests . 
The feeling in [LOC China  ] that [LOC China  ] remains too poor and underdeveloped to be much of a global stakeholder remains strong , although it would appear that [LOC China  ] 's standard of " developed " is increasingly the [LOC United States  ] . 
One academic said , " the [LOC United States  ] still reaps almost all of the benefits of 'international public goods' and should expect to bear almost all of the costs . 
" This argument , along with the frequent pious invocation of " non-interference in internal affairs " provides a thin political justification for [LOC China  ] 's fundamentally mercantile pursuit of resources in [LOC Burma  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Sudan  ] and other pariah states . 
The tension between [LOC China  ] 's long-term , broad global interests and its short-term , naked national interests will persist in [MISC Chinese  ] foreign policy for some time . 
So far , public opinion has been the most effective tool in blunting the [MISC Chinese  ] effort to profit from its rogue-state relationships . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] want to build an international image as a responsible power and are sensitive to accusations that they facilitate the abuses of rogue regimes . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] cooperation on [LOC Darfur  ] after international outcry began to [LOC BEIJING  ] 00000661 003 OF 004 threaten another core interest ( a successful [MISC Olympics  ] ) demonstrates how public opinion can provide effective motivation . 
ACTIVISM VS . 
NON-INTERFERENCE ----------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Part of the debate over [LOC China  ] 's role as stakeholder stems from differing views on [LOC China  ] 's long-standing , expedient policy of " non-interference . 
" Since the beginning of the reform era , [LOC China  ] has generally followed [PER Deng Xiaoping  ] 's advice to maintain a low profile and focus on its own development . 
In this spirit , [LOC China  ] 's pledge of " non-interference " in other nations' affairs became a pillar of [LOC China  ] 's declared foreign policy . 
More recently , some have viewed President [PER Hu Jintao  ] 's trademark " [MISC Harmonious World  ] " policy as a subtle renunciation of non-interference that acknowledges the need for [LOC China  ] to be engaged in a globalized world . 
One prominent foreign policy expert told us that while [LOC China  ] is still " feeling its way " on an activist foreign policy , [LOC Beijing  ] will continue to move toward greater engagement and less " non-interference . 
" [MISC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said more bluntly that [LOC China  ] 's non-interference policy " has always been flexible " and that [LOC China  ] is comfortable in an activist role whe it wants to be . 
HUMAN RIGHTS ------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) As economic success increases [LOC China  ] 's confidence that [LOC China  ] can develop without [MISC Western-style  ] democracy , resistance to [LOC U.S.  ] promotion of human rights may intensify . 
At the same time , [MISC Chinese  ] leaders see the utility of a limited expansion of civil society , including improvements in the rule of law and a stronger role for approved religions , NGOs , charities and other actors in areas that contribute to social stability and do not challenge [ORG Communist Party  ] rule . 
[LOC China  ] is open to [LOC U.S.  ] experience in these areas , though [MISC Chinese  ] leaders will tolerate only slow and limited change . 
In areas such as [LOC Tibet  ] and [LOC Xinjiang  ] , the fear of separatism leads to tighter restrictions on the growth of civil society . 
We should continue to press the [MISC Chinese  ] to resume our formal human rights dialogue to provide a bilateral channel for a regular , high-level exchange of views . 
In such discussions , we should continue to express our serious concerns over [LOC Beijing  ] 's human rights record and appeal to [LOC China  ] 's growing awareness that greater respect for human rights , religious freedom and the rule of law will serve to promote the very development and social stability that [LOC China  ] seeks as well as to improve [LOC China  ] 's international image . 
THE ROLE OF SOFT POWER ---------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [LOC China  ] actively pursues educational exchanges , cultural performances , youth exchanges and other instruments of " soft power . 
" Development assistance to resource-rich nations has also grown and remains generally without conditions ( except with respect to the [LOC Taiwan  ] issue ) . 
[LOC China  ] is also making attempts to break into what it sees as an undesirable [MISC Western  ] , and specifically [MISC American  ] , monopoly of the international news media and to offer an alternative to ubiquitous [MISC American  ] popular culture . 
Soft power is a useful arrow in the [MISC Chinese  ] foreign policy quiver but should not be overestimated . 
[MISC Chinese  ] culture tends toward exceptionalism rather than universality ; i.e. , many things about [MISC Chinese  ] culture , in the [MISC Chinese  ] view , are appropriate ( or even intelligible ) to [MISC Chinese  ] alone . 
Moreover , [LOC China  ] senses that its traditional low profile and attempts not to be seen as competing with the values and political systems of other countries are part of its attractiveness . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] acknowledge both the limits of soft power and that [LOC China  ] 's reliance on soft power is in large measure due to the fact that [LOC China  ] , in the near-term , lacks hard power . 
[LOC TAIWAN  ] ------ <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S ) [LOC China  ] has long identified [LOC Taiwan  ] as one of its core interests . 
[MISC Chinese  ] leaders see preventing [LOC Taiwan  ] 's formal independence as crucial to their legitimacy , and the [LOC United States  ] is committed to the defense of the status quo absent agreement to a change by the peoples on both sides of the [MISC Strait  ] . 
[LOC Taiwan  ] will continue to be the largest threat to [MISC U.S.-China  ] relations , potentially resulting in armed conflict . 
Though [LOC China  ] always wants more , for the past two years [MISC Chinese  ] leaders have appeared relatively satisfied with and even appreciative of [LOC U.S.  ] policy toward [LOC Taiwan  ] , despite rhetoric to the contrary . 
[LOC U.S.  ] disaffection with [PER Chen Shui-bian  ] and explicit [LOC U.S.  ] opposition to the [ORG DPP  ] referendum on [ORG UN  ] membership in the name of [LOC Taiwan  ] have eased [LOC China  ] 's anxieties to a degree . 
Nevertheless , our uneasy modus vivendi on the [LOC Taiwan  ] issue is fragile . 
[LOC Beijing  ] may mistakenly come to believe , despite our constant disclaimers , that we are willing to " manage " [LOC Taiwan  ] in partnership with [LOC China  ] over the heads of [LOC Taiwan  ] 's democratically elected leaders . 
[LOC Taiwan  ] 's next President may win a few short-term , small concessions from [LOC China  ] . 
However , thwarted [MISC Chinese  ] expectations [LOC BEIJING  ] 00000661 004 OF 004 of progress toward reunification or of a [LOC U.S.  ] willingness to " manage " [LOC Taiwan  ] could lead to a rocky medium term . 
CHINA'S EXPANDING " CORE INTERESTS " ---------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( S ) In addition to [LOC Taiwan  ] and other sovereignty concerns ( e.g. , [LOC Tibet  ] and the [PER Dalai Lama  ] and [LOC Xinjiang  ] and [PER Rebiya Kadeer  ] ) , [LOC China  ] has begun to articulate additional " core interests " in [MISC Chinese  ] foreign policy . 
So far , these core interests center on [LOC China  ] 's access to energy resources . 
Thus , in [LOC Iran  ] and [ORG Sudan China  ] has resisted international sanctions that would affect its energy cooperation . 
Recently , [LOC China  ] has suggested that cooperation in the [ORG UNSC  ] and in other areas is contingent on the [LOC U.S.  ] not sanctioning [ORG Sinopec  ] 's investment in [LOC Iran  ] 's [LOC Yadavaran  ] oilfield . 
[LOC U.S.  ] policy will need to ensure that when we challenge [LOC China  ] 's self-defined core interests , we do so deliberately and advisedly . 
ROLE OF [LOC U.S.  ] POLICY ------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Many aspects of the [MISC U.S.-China  ] relationship are not amenable to foreign policy intervention . 
[LOC China  ] 's growth and slow settling into the role of a great power result from largely economic and historical trends . 
Similarly , tensions over [LOC Taiwan  ] , given the firm parameters of [LOC U.S.  ] law and our interests in ensuring a peaceful resolution of issues affecting a democratic [LOC Taiwan  ] , will be uavoidable . 
Nonetheless , we can protect our economic and political interests , spur positive change in [LOC China  ] and increase [LOC Beijing  ] 's realization of its stake in effective international institutions and international norms . 
[LOC China  ] 's changing worldview and increasing interest in how it is perceived on the international stage will create new opportunities to influence [LOC China  ] . 
Pursuing an increasingly close and cooperative [MISC U.S.-China  ] relationship will require constant attention and frequent high-level meetings and dialogues to expand our common interests , manage our differences and prevent misunderstandings and misperceptions in a rapidly changing world .
