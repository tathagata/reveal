REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) This is an action request . 
Please see para 8. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: The head of [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG Center for Remote Sensing and Space Science  ] expressed interest in renewing cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] on astronomy , seismology and satellites . 
The [ORG Center  ] 's Director sought Embassy assistance in purchasing a [MISC U.S.-origin  ] " mini-satellite " and telescopes for a new [ORG National Observatory  ] project . 
He also expressed interest in joint workshops and training opportunities . 
This could be useful areas for engagement with the [ORG Presidential Science Envoy  ] . 
End summary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On February 3 , Pol/Econ Chief and Econoff met with [PER Hadi Gashut  ] , head of [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG Center for Remote Sensing and Space Science  ] , who had requested the meeting to renew discussions on cooperative projects and to enlist the [ORG Embassy  ] 's assistance to facilitate [LOC Libya  ] 's procurement of a " mini-satellite " from the [LOC United States  ] . 
[PER Gashut  ] was joined by two other colleagues , [PER Abdalrahem Aboghofa  ] , Director of [ORG Technical Projects  ] , and [PER Sharif M. Sharif  ] , Manager of the [ORG Technical Department  ] . 
[PER Gashut  ] explained the [ORG Center  ] 's interest in purchasing a " high resolution mini-satellite " -- preferably from the [LOC U.S.  ] -- to track the rate of desertification in [LOC Libya  ] , monitor the status of the [ORG Great Manmade River Project  ] ( which pipes water from aquifers in the [LOC Sahara  ] to the coastal areas ) , and observe [LOC Libya  ] 's borders . 
He said the [MISC Libyan  ] agency had not yet contacted any [ORG U.S. Government  ] agencies , such as [ORG NASA  ] , or any [LOC U.S.  ] companies , and sought guidance from the [ORG Embassy  ] on how to locate the appropriate contact . 
[PER Gashut  ] said that [LOC Libya  ] 's neighbors had such satellites , noting that [LOC Algeria  ] had three satellites , [LOC Egypt  ] had two , and [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] had a few of its own . 
Due to the likely need for an export license , [PER Gashut  ] said he wanted to go through the [ORG Embassy  ] from the outset in order to follow the proper procedure . 
[ORG LIBYA HAS  ] 300 CLOUDLESS NIGHTS: PERFECT FOR ASTRONOMY <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) According to [PER Gashut  ] , [LOC Libya  ] has , on average , " 300 cloudless nights , " and therefore offers an excellent locale for astronomy research . 
" Whereas other government agencies are interested in the sun and solar energy these days , our concern is for the moon and the stars , " he stated . 
[PER Gashut  ] outlined [MISC Libyan  ] plans for a new [ORG National Observatory  ] and requested [ORG Embassy  ] assistance in identifying a [LOC U.S.  ] supplier of 2-4 meter telescopes for the project . 
Ideally , the telescope would be robotic , and one which astronomers in other countries could remotely access . 
He said that [LOC Libya  ] only had a small , mobile telescope ( 50 cm ) . 
The [MISC Libyans  ] have had the specifications for the telescope for five years , and have also discussed the project with the [MISC Europeans  ] but , according to [PER Gashut  ] , the [MISC Europeans  ] " did not understand the importance " of the project and have not helped identify sources . 
He said he could send the specifications to any interested companies . 
SEISMOLOGY <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Gashut  ] asked if [LOC U.S.  ] experts would be interested in participating in workshops on seismology and other related topics . 
He said [LOC Libya  ] had signed a memorandum of understanding with the [ORG U.S. Geological Service  ] ( [ORG USGS  ] ) in 2008 and that [LOC Libya  ] was " now ready " to move forward on joint projects . 
One need was for short-term training ( 2-3 months ) for [MISC Libyan  ] researchers , for which [LOC Libya  ] could cover all transportation if the [ORG USGS  ] could help with hotel and food costs . 
As for whether [LOC Libya  ] was ready to join the [ORG Global Seismic Network  ] ( [ORG GSN  ] ) , a consortium of countries that share seismic data , he intimated it was a non-starter at the moment since the " decision-makers don't understand " the importance of joining the network . 
[PER Gashut  ] commented that he and his colleagues were " scientists , not involved in sensitive , political issues . 
" Nevertheless , he did not want to let GOL inaction on the [ORG GSN  ] impede progress in other areas , such as exchanges and graduate study for [MISC Libyans  ] in the [LOC U.S.  ] He added that [ORG UNESCO  ] had a project to help [LOC Libya  ] equip 15 seismology stations with strong motion detection capability . 
[PER Gashut  ] noted that the project had been stalled , since [ORG UNESCO  ] had been working with a [MISC Swiss  ] company , [PER Geo-Signal  ] , hinting that ongoing political differences between [LOC Libya  ] and [LOC Switzerland  ] had derailed the progress . 
[ORG NASA: LIBYA WELCOMES YOU BACK  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Regarding the equipment that [ORG NASA  ] had provided to the University of [LOC Sebha  ] , [PER Gashut  ] said that the Very Low Frequency ( VLF ) equipment was still in place and being used for research . 
He said the [ORG NASA  ] staff , including the project manager [PER Joseph Davila  ] , were welcome to return to [LOC Libya  ] for a visit and to renew [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000133 002.2 OF 002 collaboration on the project . 
He recommended [PER Davila  ] contact the University of [LOC Sebha  ] to discuss trip dates . 
[PER Gashut  ] pledged to help facilitate visa approvals for [ORG NASA  ] visitors . 
BACKGROUND <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Gashut  ] noted that his organization falls under the [ORG National Authority for Scientific Research  ] , headed by [PER Mohammed Sharif  ] , which is part of the General People 's Committee for Higher Education ( MOE-equivalent ) . 
This is separate from the work of Dr. [PER Ali Gashut  ] ( no relation ) who is the head of the [ORG Libyan Atomic Energy Establishment  ] . 
COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Following the signing of the [ORG U.S.-Libya Science and Technology Agreement  ] , no [MISC Libyan  ] institutions , with the exception of the [ORG Libyan Atomic Energy Establishment  ] , have reached out to follow through on proposed joint projects . 
Post assumes that while our interlocutors at the working level are keenly interested in working with [LOC U.S.  ] experts , approval for direct contact is sometimes blocked at higher levels . 
The [ORG Center for Remote Sensing and Space Science  ] 's desire to renew collaboration on a variety of projects is encouraging , and we recommend following-up on its request for training in the [LOC U.S.  ] and to conduct joint-workshops with [LOC U.S.  ] experts . 
Dr. [PER Gashut  ] also could be a useful interlocutor for [ORG Science Envoy  ] Dr. [PER Zerhouni  ] . 
We note that the [MISC Libyan  ] 's request to purchase a [MISC U.S.-origin  ] " mini-satellite " could raise export control issues , and request the [ORG Department 's  ] guidance on whether it is realistic for [LOC Libya  ] to pursue the procurement of a [MISC U.S.-sourced  ] satellite and a [MISC U.S.-sourced  ] telescope at this time .
