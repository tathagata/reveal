Reasons 1.4 ( b/d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC SUMMARY: At  ] the request of the [ORG French Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] , Secretary of Defense [PER Robert Gates  ] ( [ORG SecDef  ] ) met with [MISC French  ] FM [PER Bernard Kouchner  ] in [LOC Paris  ] on February 8 , 2010 . 
Discussions included how to persuade the [MISC Chinese  ] and others to support sanctions against [LOC Iran  ] , and the importance of targeting the [MISC Iranian  ] government rather than the people . 
On [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Kouchner  ] confirmed that [LOC France  ] would maintain its position that it could not add additional combat troops for the time being but was open to the possibility of sending additional trainers . 
Both [PER Kouchner  ] and [ORG SecDef  ] lauded recent progress in [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
Discussing [ORG NATO  ] , [PER Kouchner  ] argued for a stronger [MISC European  ] pillar , which [ORG SecDef  ] supported with the caution that pursuit of an independent [MISC European  ] security role risked reducing the already limited capabilities available to the Alliance . 
[ORG SecDef  ] also raised the need for reform and for examination of future [ORG NATO  ] missions , which he would define narrowly rather than broadly . 
END SUMMARY ---- [LOC Iran  ] ---- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Kouchner  ] said that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC France  ] were working well together in [LOC New York  ] on an [LOC Iran  ] sanctions resolution - all the problems now are with the [MISC Chinese  ] . 
[PER Kouchner  ] had met [MISC Chinese  ] FM [PER Yang  ] twice the previous week , but said that right now it was difficult to predict whether the [MISC Chinese  ] would veto or abstain . 
He noted that the [MISC Chinese  ] were furious over the [MISC U.S.-Taiwan  ] arms deal , which would make it difficult to get a resolution passed in [LOC February.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG SecDef  ] observed that [LOC Russia  ] usually followed [LOC China  ] 's lead on [LOC North Korea  ] , whereas [LOC China  ] usually followed [LOC Russia  ] on [LOC Iran  ] . 
Therefore we should try to get the [MISC Russians  ] to persuade the [MISC Chinese  ] to support the [LOC Iran  ] sanctions resolution . 
MFA political director [PER Jacques Audibert  ] remarked that the [MISC Russians  ] had been helpful during the last P5-plus-one teleconference , but he worried that the [MISC Russians  ] would water down the content of the resolution . 
[PER Kouchner  ] said that President [PER Medvedev  ] seemed strongly on board , and there was daylight between his position and that of Foreign Minister [PER Lavrov  ] . 
[ORG SecDef  ] said he suspected that [LOC China  ] ultimately would not want to be isolated and would abstain. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG SecDef  ] urged [PER Kouchner  ] not to exaggerate the [MISC Chinese  ] concern over [LOC Taiwan  ] - they would need a little more time and , in the end , an abstention might be a good enough result for us . 
He added that we should urge the [MISC Saudis  ] to weigh in with [LOC Beijing  ] since [LOC China  ] has more at stake in its relations with [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] than [LOC Iran  ] . 
He commented that the [MISC Saudis  ] always want to " fight the [MISC Iranians  ] to the last [MISC American  ] , " but that now it is time for them to get into the game. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Raising his concerns about bringing non-permanent [ORG UNSC  ] members on board , [ORG SecDef  ] reported that in [LOC Ankara  ] he had impressed upon PM [PER Erdogan  ] the dangers of proliferation to other [LOC Middle East  ] countries or an [MISC Israeli  ] strike if the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear program couldn't be stopped . 
[PER Kouchner  ] expressed his doubts about [LOC Turkey  ] 's desire for a constructive role in region , describing [PER Erdogan  ] 's comments to [MISC Ahmadinejad  ] defending the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear program as dangerous. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Kouchner  ] then asked [ORG SecDef  ] for his perspectives on the popular protests in [LOC Iran  ] . 
In the [MISC French  ] view , the internal developments were very important - the most significant change in decades . 
He urged careful thought about how to avoid discouraging the protesters with sanctions , bearing in mind that the protesters did not support [LOC Tehran  ] 's ambitions for nuclear weapons . 
He further emphasized his belief that human rights issues should receive attention as well. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG SecDef  ] said that [PER Kouchner  ] 's argument underscored the need to focus sanctions on the [ORG IRGC  ] and companies it owns , in order to minimize the hardship for the [MISC Iranian  ] people . 
He remarked that [MISC Iranians  ] across the political spectrum support a peaceful nuclear program , but it was not clear whether they favored acquisition of nuclear weapons . 
Therefore , our political strategy should reaffirm [LOC Iran  ] 's right to have a civilian nuclear program as long as it is safeguarded and in compliance with the [ORG Non-Proliferation Treaty.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Further explaining the [LOC U.S.  ] position , [ORG SecDef  ] said that while our understanding of the [MISC Iranian  ] leadership was opaque , we do know that they do not like to be isolated . 
The [ORG USG  ] would soon be designating several [ORG IRGC  ] companies under the [ORG Iran Sanctions Act  ] . 
His own view was that it was important to get the [ORG UNSCR  ] passed quickly , even if it were not as harsh as we might wish . 
Once a resolution is passed , he explained , it will offer a legal platform on which the [ORG EU  ] and individual states can impose harsher sanctions . 
[LOC PARIS  ] 00000174 002 OF 003 <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Kouchner  ] agreed , but added that another problem was to get the nine votes needed in the [ORG UNSC  ] . 
He said that [LOC Lebanon  ] was one of [LOC France  ] 's prime targets in this respect , but he doubted that [LOC France  ] would be able to bring the resolution to a vote during its presidency , as February is a very short month . 
[LOC Gabon  ] , which takes the chair in March , is a " good asset for [LOC France  ] , " he commented . 
[PER Audibert  ] interjected that the [MISC Russians  ] had supported deleting some sections of the draft [ORG UNSCR  ] , but had approved including sanctions on the [ORG IRGC  ] . 
[PER Kouchner  ] said that [LOC France  ] had to proceed carefully since a [MISC French  ] woman had been taken hostage in [LOC Tehran  ] . 
He disparaged FM [ORG Mottaki  ] 's duplicitous performance in [LOC Munich.  ] ----------- [LOC Afghanistan  ] ----------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) On [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Kouchner  ] confirmed that [LOC France  ] would maintain its position that it could not add additional combat troops for the time being . 
Pledging that [LOC France  ] would stay " until the very end , " he said that the [MISC French  ] would send 80 [MISC French  ] trainers to [LOC Kabul  ] on their own , but were also looking into joint training opportunities with [LOC Germany  ] - possibly an [MISC OMLT.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Kouchner  ] solicited [ORG SecDef  ] 's reaction to [PER Karzai  ] 's idea of local non-combat zones . 
[PER Gates  ] said that he was not familiar with this proposal but was skeptical about declaring zones where the government could not use force since we could not enforce similar restraint on the [MISC Taliban.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [LOC U.S.  ] , [ORG SecDef  ] said , supports reintegration and has money in its military budget to support short-term efforts at integration similar to the Sons of [LOC Iraq  ] initiative in [LOC Anbar  ] province . 
[PER Kouchner  ] commented that a key was to provide higher salaries to the [ORG ANA  ] and [ORG ANP  ] . 
[ORG SecDef  ] agreed , noting that salary increases in late 2009 had led to an increase in recruits . 
[PER Kouchner  ] said that this made sense as we were fighting misery as well as terrorism. -------- [LOC Pakistan  ] -------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Turning to [LOC Pakistan  ] , [ORG SecDef  ] described the dramatic changes that had taken place over the past year . 
It was astonishing that President [PER Zadari  ] had remained in power and that the [MISC Pakistanis  ] had conducted such effective COIN operations . 
He noted that coordination between [LOC ISAF  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] 's armed forces was improving - and this was creating a more difficult situation for the [ORG Taliban  ] along the border . 
The [LOC Pakistan  ] operation in [MISC South Waziristan  ] had flushed out [ORG Taliban  ] and [ORG Al Qaeda  ] elements ; they were more vulnerable on the move . 
Moreover , [LOC Pakistan  ] 's aggressive campaign against the insurgency had won broad political support among all political parties . 
Operations in the [LOC West  ] and [LOC North-West  ] had begun to accrue respect for [LOC Pakistan  ] Army that [PER Musharraf  ] had squandered . 
It is important for all of us to talk to the [MISC Pakistanis  ] and provide economic assistance . 
[ORG SecDef  ] commented that one can never be an optimist about [LOC Pakistan  ] , but that the changes had been striking . 
[PER Kouchner  ] agreed with [ORG SecDef  ] 's analysis that the changes in both the political and military spheres were " nothing short of a miracle . 
" ----- [ORG NATO  ] ----- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Kouchner  ] then raised [ORG NATO  ] , declaring that [LOC France  ] was ready to play its role in defining the [ORG Alliance  ] 's future strategy . 
He said that General Abrial ( Supreme Allied Commander - Transformation ) has offered input , but emphasized that it was critical to come up with real strategy that we could explain in debates in Parliament . 
[PER Kouchner  ] stressed that we needed to clarify [ORG NATO  ] 's roles and missions , as well as its role in combating the threats of terrorism , poverty and oppression . 
[ORG SecDef  ] agreed that the [ORG Strategic Concept  ] should deal with 21st century security threats Q with an emphasis on the word " security . 
" He said the [ORG Strategic Concept  ] should also incorporate lessons learned from [LOC Afghanistan  ] - particularly the need for comprehensive civil-military strategies and better partnership between [ORG NATO  ] and the [ORG EU  ] and [ORG UN.  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [ORG SecDef  ] said that [ORG NATO  ] reform should proceed hand-in-hand with an examination of [ORG Alliance  ] threats and missions , either as a parallel process or as a part of the [ORG Strategic Concept  ] itself . 
In this regard , the [ORG Alliance  ] cannot afford so many headquarters and needs to take steps [LOC PARIS  ] 00000174 003 OF 003 to reduce overhead. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [ORG SecDef  ] also stated that the [ORG Alliance  ] should be clear as to what [ORG NATO  ] 's limits are -- for example , it does not have role in the [LOC Pacific  ] . 
We should adhere to the basic principle that [ORG NATO  ] is about the security of its member states . 
We all face terrorist risks , and there are many other new threats , but [ORG SecDef  ] would be inclined to define future missions narrowly rather than broadly. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Kouchner  ] highlighted piracy as an emerging issue on which the [ORG EU  ] and [ORG NATO  ] were working together , although the real problem was inside [LOC Somalia  ] . 
As an aside , he mentioned that [LOC France  ] was willing to support the training of additional troops for the [MISC TFG.  ] <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [PER Kouchner  ] argued that strengthening the [MISC European  ] pillar in [ORG NATO  ] was necessary: the [ORG EU  ] cannot exist without defense , the [LOC U.S.  ] needs strong [MISC European  ] Allies , and a strong [MISC European  ] pillar was not in contradiction with [ORG NATO  ] . 
[ORG SecDef  ] replied that during his time as [ORG SecDef  ] , he has felt the need for a better way for [ORG EU  ] and [ORG NATO  ] to work together . 
While [ORG NATO  ] is primarily a security alliance , it can't do its job without a civilian component . 
The [ORG EU  ] is primarily a political-economic organization , but he was willing to acknowledge that it had some security role -- such as counterpiracy or peacekeeping in [LOC Chad  ] . 
[ORG SecDef  ] said that while each organization might have its primary role and mission , they could both perform both functions. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) Interpreting [ORG SecDef  ] 's latter comment as prohibiting an [ORG EU  ] security role , [PER Kouchner  ] dissented and said that since 500 million people live in the [ORG European Union  ] , the [ORG EU  ] needed to be able to adequately protect them . 
[PER Gates  ] observed that [LOC France  ] was just one of 5 or 6 nations that spent more than 2 percent of GDP on defense , and that if the [ORG EU  ] decided it needed an independent security role , it could reduce number of forces available to [ORG NATO  ] and cripple the [ORG Alliance  ] . 
Even now , [ORG NATO  ] had insufficient resources . 
[PER Kouchner  ] said that we needed to share burdens among all nations , and that it was hard to make people spend more on defense in the midst of an economic crisis. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 .
