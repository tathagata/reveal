( C ) [MISC Brazilian  ] Ambassador [PER Joao Carlos  ] da [PER Sousa Gomes  ] , acting on instructions , proposed that we trade licensing for [LOC U.S.  ] components in the [MISC Tucano  ] aircraft for [MISC Brazilian  ] support for [ORG Sumate  ] with the [ORG BRV  ] . 
That sounds like a bad trade to us , but we asked whether [ORG GOB  ] would be willing to discuss help regarding the [ORG BRV  ] 's push for a non-permanent [ORG UNSC  ] seat . 
[ORG Da Sousa Gomes  ] said the [MISC Bolivarians  ] were unhappy with [MISC Brazilian  ] FM [ORG Amorim  ] 's criticism of the [ORG BRV  ] role in the nationalization of the [MISC Bolivian  ] hydrocarbon industry , resulting in a call from a nervous FM [PER Rodriguez  ] demanding a " retraction . 
" The [MISC Brazilian  ] made clear that despite this rough patch , [LOC Brasilia  ] had a lasting interest in maintaining good relations with [LOC Caracas  ] . 
[ORG Da Sousa Gomes  ] , in the mood to chat , also shared the details of a " chilling " conversation he had had with [MISC Iranian  ] Ambassador [PER Sobhani  ] , who was apparently unconcerned about the prospects of a broader conflict over the nuclear impasse . 
Finally , da [PER Sousa Gomes  ] told us of a recent talk with [MISC Cuban  ] Ambassador [PER Sanchez  ] , who attacked [ORG Sumate  ] and related details of the carnal activities of fellow ambassadors . 
We leave to the Department whether to consider an approach on the [ORG UNSC  ] , as well as whether to offer the [ORG GOB  ] a briefing on [MISC Iranian  ] support for terrorism in the hemisphere . 
End summary . 
[PER Tucanos  ] for [ORG Sumate  ] ------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Ambassador and DCM met with [MISC Brazilian  ] Ambassador [PER Joao Carlos  ] da [PER Sousa Gomes  ] on May 10 at his request to discuss a number of issues . 
[ORG Da Sousa Gomes  ] was principally interested in proposing a " deal " to permit licensing of [LOC U.S.  ] components of [MISC Tucano  ] aircraft to [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
Stating that his message came direct from [MISC Brazilian  ] FM [ORG Amorim  ] , he said that [LOC Brazil  ] was still deeply interested in selling the [PER Tucanos  ] to the [ORG BRV  ] . 
He argued that permitting the sale would give the [ORG GOB  ] the ability to influence the [ORG BRV  ] ; taken the other way , the inability to complete the sale undercut [LOC Brazil  ] 's moderating influence in [LOC Caracas  ] . 
Admitting that this was a " difficult issue for [ORG USG  ] , " da [PER Sousa Gomes  ] said he was authorized to propose a trade: the [LOC United States  ] gives on the [PER Tucanos  ] , and [ORG GOB  ] takes a more proactive stance with the [ORG BRV  ] on [ORG Sumate  ] . 
[ORG Da Sousa Gomes  ] said this help would be particularly useful now , because he believed another [ORG BRV  ] assault on [ORG Sumate  ] was likely in the near future. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The Ambassador replied that he could not speak to the [PER Tucanos  ] ; that was a decision made in [LOC Washington  ] . 
Having said that , he noted the proposed [MISC Brazilian  ] action on [ORG Sumate  ] was symbolic , whereas the [PER Tucanos  ] were real . 
It would be difficult to sell such a linkage to [LOC Washington  ] . 
On the other hand , there was one very concrete issue that [LOC Brazil  ] could be helpful on: [LOC Venezuela  ] 's bid for a non-permanent seat on the [ORG UNSC  ] . 
While he emphasized he was not speaking on instructions , the Ambassador said that such a linkage would be more concrete and , therefore , perhaps compelling to the [ORG USG  ] . 
[ORG Da Sousa Gomes  ] was skeptical , noting that the [ORG BRV  ] 's early commitment to permanent seat for [LOC Brazil  ] on [ORG UNSC  ] made it [LOC CARACAS  ] 00001276 002.2 OF 003 difficult for the [ORG GOB  ] to fail to back the [ORG BRV  ] for a temporary seat. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The Ambassador delved further . 
[ORG GRULAC  ] is obviously split over the issue of its candidate for the nonpermanent seat . 
If pushed by a large , influential nation interested in ensuring consensus , the [ORG GRULAC  ] might find a candidate other than [LOC Venezuela  ] who might receive consensus support . 
He concluded this part of the discussion by indicating that he doubted that [LOC Washington  ] would reopen [MISC Tucano  ] decision , but might be more inclined to do so if it were part of a package to solve our mutual problem of the [ORG BRV  ] 's candidacy for a non-permanent [ORG UNSC  ] seat . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] Push-back Touches [MISC Bolivarian  ] Nerve -------------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) We began the conversation discussing the news of the day , FM [ORG Amorim  ] 's strong push-back against the [ORG BRV  ] for its role in the nationalization of the [MISC Bolivian  ] gas industry . 
[ORG Da Sousa Gomes  ] made a number of observations about the [ORG GOB  ] 's views that were identical to those already reported by [ORG Embassy Brasilia  ] ( refs ) . 
He took credit for the idea of [ORG Amorim  ] 's strong words , saying he 'd argued that the [ORG BRV  ] respected a government that stood up for itself . 
That said , da [PER Sousa Gomes  ] said that [LOC Brasilia  ] had no interest in provoking a further crisis over this matter . 
[LOC Venezuela  ] was a neighbor , and they needed to find ways to get along. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [MISC Brazilian  ] ambassador said that the [ORG BRV  ] was stirred up by [ORG Amorim  ] 's words . 
[ORG BRV  ] FM [PER Ali Rodriguez  ] called him even before [ORG Amorim  ] had finished speaking to demand a " retraction . 
" da [PER Sousa Gomes  ] told him that was impossible , so a flustered [PER Rodriguez  ] insisted on speaking with [ORG Amorim  ] directly , to make the same points . 
He got no satisfaction in that call . 
According to da [PER Sousa Gomes  ] , President [PER Chavez  ] himself called [LOC Brasilia  ] , seeking to speak with President [PER Lula  ] , but [PER Lula  ] did not take the call . 
( [PER Note: Both  ] presidents will be at the [MISC EU-Latin America  ] summit , so [PER Chavez  ] will doubtless corner [PER Lula  ] , there if not before . 
) [LOC Iran  ] ---- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) da [PER Sousa Gomes  ] then turned to a recent conversation he had with [MISC Iranian  ] Ambassador [PER Ahmad Sobhani  ] . 
According to da [PER Sousa Gomes  ] , [PER Sobhani  ] told him that there was a great deal of misinformation about [LOC Iran  ] 's activities in [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
There was no collaboration on nuclear matters , and [PER Sobhani  ] derided [LOC Venezuela  ] 's tiny nuclear research program as unserious . 
[PER Sobhani  ] said that the stories about a uranium mining operation were also untrue . 
When the [MISC Brazilian  ] queried about the impasse in the [ORG IAEA  ] and now the [ORG UN  ] on the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear program , [PER Sobhani  ] said that [LOC Iran  ] had a problem with the [LOC United States  ] and " all of [LOC Europe  ] " on this issue , and would not back down . 
The ability to run its own peaceful nuclear program was a point of principle for [LOC Iran  ] . 
[ORG Da Sousa Gomes  ] said that he came away from the conversation chilled by the [MISC Iranian  ] 's unconcern over the prospect that his government 's actions might provoke a broader conflict . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] offered to give us a written summary of his report to [LOC Brasilia  ] for our information. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The Ambassador was grateful for the information , and underlined our strong concerns about [MISC Iran-Venezuela  ] links . 
Our concerns focused in three separate areas . 
First , on the nuclear front , for reasons well known to all . 
Second , the [LOC CARACAS  ] 00001276 003 OF 003 [LOC United States  ] is increasingly concerned that [MISC Iranian  ] know-how , both technical and in terms of avoiding [LOC U.S.  ] prohibitions on the sale of military parts to [LOC Iran  ] , would help the [ORG BRV  ] evade any limitations on the sale of military parts to the [ORG BRV  ] . 
Finally , and most importantly , we are concerned about terrorism . 
[LOC Iran  ] has a well-known link with [ORG Hezbollah  ] , a deadly terrorist organization . 
The [MISC Iranian  ] government has pledged to attack the [LOC U.S.  ] homeland if attacked . 
We are worried that an Iranian-supported [ORG Hezbollah  ] or other terrorist presence in [LOC Venezuela  ] could represent a threat to the [LOC United States  ] . 
[ORG Da Sousa Gomes  ] clearly had not thought this last issue through , and asked if we could provide additional information . 
The Ambassador agreed to look into the matter , noting that obviously any such discussions would occur in [LOC Brasilia  ] or [LOC Washington  ] . 
[LOC Cuba  ] ---- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Finally , the chatty da [PER Sousa Gomes  ] gave us his readout on a recent lunch with [MISC Cuban  ] Ambassador [PER German Sanchez Otero  ] . 
( [PER Note: Da Sousa Gomes  ] said that he could attest to the long-serving ( over 11 years in [LOC Caracas  ] ) Sanchez' close ties to [MISC Cuban  ] dictator [PER Fidel Castro  ] ; the old rascal called [PER Sanchez  ] three times during the course of the lunch ! ) According to da [PER Sousa Gomes  ] , [PER Sanchez  ] is totally plugged in to the [MISC Bolivarian  ] government , relating in a detailed fashion the inner workings of various ministries . 
[PER Sanchez  ] also eagerly discussed [MISC Venezuelan  ] internal political developments , focusing of course on the upcoming presidential elections . 
[PER Sanchez  ] had nice things to say about left-wing candidate [PER Teodoro Petkoff  ] , at least at a personal level ; da [PER Sousa Gomes  ] noted that he 's heard similar expressions of personal affection for [PER Petkoff  ] from [MISC Bolivarian  ] officials. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) da [PER Sousa Gomes  ] was particularly struck by two elements of his conversation with [MISC Sanchez:  ] first , a deep hatred for [ORG Sumate  ] , which [PER Sanchez  ] claimed was a subversive organization funded by the [ORG CIA  ] which had to be stopped . 
( da [PER Sousa Gomes'  ] earlier warning that the [ORG BRV  ] might have planned a fresh assault on [ORG Sumate  ] ( para 3 ) may have in part been informed by [PER Sanchez  ] harsh words for the [ORG NGO  ] ) . 
Second , [PER Sanchez  ] delighted in relating the prurient details of the personal lives of other ambassadors accredited here . 
[ORG Da Sousa Gomes  ] added that he believed that some ambassadors actually submitted written reports to the [ORG BRV  ] on the peccadilloes of their fellow ambassadors. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Actions requested: -- [MISC Tucano  ] trade: We oppose reconsidering the [MISC Tucano  ] decision for a promise to be proactive on [ORG Sumate  ] . 
It is the [ORG Department 's  ] call whether to pursue a possible [MISC Tucano-UNSC  ] connection . 
-- Briefing to the [ORG GOB  ] on Iran: da [PER Sousa Gomes  ] seemed genuinely taken aback by the notion that an [MISC Iranian  ] diplomatic presence might support [ORG Hezbollah  ] or another FTO in the [LOC Western Hemisphere  ] . 
[LOC Washington  ] and [ORG Embassy Brasilia  ] may want to consider a detailed briefing on this matter to relevant [ORG GOB  ] officials .
