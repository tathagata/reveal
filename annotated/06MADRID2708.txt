END SUMMARY . 
-- The [ORG Iberoamerican Summit  ] -- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) Over breakfast at the Ambassador 's residence on October 17 , [PER Iglesias  ] told the Ambassador and DCM that his first year as [ORG Iberoamerican  ] Secretary General has been busy . 
Now it is even busier as he and the [MISC Secretariat  ] staff prepare for the [ORG Summit  ] in [LOC Montevideo  ] on November 4-5 . 
He lauded the high level of attention that [LOC Spain  ] lavishes on this forum , noting that the King , President [PER Zapatero  ] , and new MFA Secretary of State for [MISC Latin America Trinidad Jimenez  ] will SIPDIS lead a big [MISC Spanish  ] delegation to [LOC Montevideo  ] . 
He also said that [LOC Spain  ] was giving the [MISC Secretariat  ] good support , including a staff of 25 . 
[PER Iglesias  ] said that [LOC Spain  ] wants this forum , where it is a big player and everyone is together at the table , to be successful . 
He said that the annual summit might seem like overkill but is an important way to tie together the many activities that go on throughout the year . 
While [LOC Uruguay  ] is working hard on the [ORG Summit  ] preparations , [PER Iglesias  ] said , it is going to be a complex event that will test the host . 
Not only is [LOC Uruguay  ] itself facing particularly difficult relations with [LOC Argentina  ] , but there are fires burning all over [LOC Latin America  ] . 
-- [LOC Uruguay  ] -- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) Speaking as an [MISC Uruguayan  ] , [PER Iglesias  ] said that [LOC Uruguay  ] feels besieged by [LOC Argentina  ] . 
He lamented that the [ORG Entre Rios  ] border crossing is closed again , and asked how [MISC Mexicans  ] would feel if the [LOC US  ] closed the [MISC US-Mexico  ] border . 
[PER Iglesias  ] said that [MISC Argentine  ] President [PER Kirchner  ] is being overly aggressive and has become the most hated man in [LOC Uruguay  ] . 
With [MISC Brazilian  ] President [PER Lula  ] no longer being helpful in resolving the dispute and [PER Kirchner  ] the source of the problem , a fairly leftist [MISC Uruguayan  ] government is being driven towards the [LOC US  ] , with which it is keen to deepen trade ties . 
-- [LOC Cuba  ] -- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) On [LOC Cuba  ] , [PER Iglesias  ] said that he has heard that [PER Raul Castro  ] might represent [LOC Cuba  ] at the [LOC Montevideo Summit  ] , but hasn't confirmed his attendance . 
[PER Iglesias  ] said that it would be an important sign if [PER Raul  ] were given external exposure at an international forum like this . 
Nonetheless , [PER Iglesias  ] said that he isn't sure that the [MISC Cubans  ] are ready for [PER Raul  ] to be seen as the head of state . 
While [PER Iglesias  ] hasn't met [PER Raul  ] , he knows the other key players in the current triumvirate: Vice President [PER Carlos Lage  ] and Foreign Minister [PER Felipe Perez Roque  ] . 
He judged that while [PER Perez Roque  ] just spews the party line , [PER Lage  ] is trusted by [PER Raul  ] and " a guy that you can talk to . 
" -- [LOC Venezuela  ] -- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Iglesias  ] said that everyone in [MISC Latin America  ] is concerned by the behavior of [PER Hugo Chavez  ] , who is becoming increasingly megalomaniacal . 
[PER Iglesias  ] said that over the years he has spent a lot of time with [PER Chavez  ] , and has recently seen more mistakes and incompetence . 
He noted that [PER Chavez  ] 's [ORG UNGA  ] speech destroyed a lot of his support within [MISC Latin America  ] . 
[PER Iglesias  ] said that [LOC Chile  ] finally decided to abstain from the [ORG UNSC  ] vote out of frustration with [PER Chavez  ] 's support of [MISC Bolivian  ] outposts on the [LOC Chile-Bolivia  ] border . 
-- [LOC Brazil  ] -- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) According to [PER Iglesias  ] , [PER Chavez  ] 's financing of seven or eight additional outposts on the [MISC Brazil-Bolivia  ] border is now encouraging [PER Lula  ] to turn his back on [PER Chavez  ] . 
[PER Iglesias  ] seemed confident that [PER Lula  ] would win the second round of the presidential election . 
He said that a recently re-elected [PER Lula  ] might begin to actively seek to contain [PER Chavez  ] , might well look for a stronger relation with [LOC Mexico  ] , and might even [ORG MADRID  ] 00002708 002 OF 002 reach out to the [LOC US  ] on trade . 
-- [LOC Mexico  ] -- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Iglesias  ] worried about the situation in [LOC Mexico  ] , which has not been able to consolidate the democratic gains that came with the election of Fox . 
He said that the instability and lawlessness in [LOC Oaxaca  ] are of real concern , though the recent [MISC PRI  ] victory in the gubernatorial race in neighboring [LOC Tabasco  ] is a positive sign . 
[PER Iglesias  ] said that [PER Lopez Obrador  ] would have been a bad president but his post-election behavior has been so horrible that he is definitively finished in [MISC Mexican  ] politics .
