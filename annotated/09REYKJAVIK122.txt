( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Icelandic  ] whalers are taking full advantage of the expanded whaling quotas issued by the former Fisheries Minister [PER Einar K. Gudfinsson  ] and have killed 24 fin whales and 20 minkes to date . 
( [LOC Note:  ] The last time fins were hunted in [LOC Iceland  ] was in 2006 when seven were killed . 
About 40 minkes are hunted each year . 
End Note . 
) [PER Gudfinsson  ] had issued a regulation upon his departure from office in January that whaling quotas for the next five years will be directly linked to the recommendations from the [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG Marine Research Institute  ] ( [MISC MRI  ] ) . 
Both of [PER Gudfinsson  ] 's successors said they would let the regulation stand for at least this year . 
On June 5 , [MISC MRI  ] published a report recommending that 200 fin whales and 200 minke whales can be hunted sustainably this year . 
[MISC MRI  ] told [PER Emboff  ] that last year 's minke recommendation of 100 whales was increased this year because the stock is considered to be close to pre-exploitation levels. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Staff members of [LOC Hvalur  ] , hf , which is the only company in [LOC Iceland  ] with the capability to hunt large whales , told [PER Emboff  ] on July 3 that whaling is providing jobs for 150 to 200 people . 
However , they admitted they are keeping their fingers crossed that there is a market for the meat and said , otherwise " this is a doomed operation . 
" Since minke meat is the only whale meat consumed and sold in [LOC Iceland  ] , the fin meat must be exported to another market , such as [LOC Japan  ] . 
In May , [ORG Greenpeace  ] and a local environmental group held a press conference which featured a recorded conversation with the [MISC Japanese  ] importer of the [MISC Icelandic  ] whale meat who stated he would not be importing any meat from [LOC Iceland  ] this year . 
In late June , the [MISC Japanese  ] Charge d'Affaires told [PER Emboff  ] that he didn't believe there was a market for the fin meat in [LOC Japan.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Charge d'Affaires met with the Minister of Fisheries on July 9 and strongly protested the renewed whaling , particularly the large number of fin whales hunted . 
[ORG CDA  ] reiterated that whaling is an impediment to agricultural and fish exports to the [LOC U.S  ] , particularly to environmentally conscious outlets like [ORG Whole Foods  ] grocery store , and underscored the [MISC Japanese  ] [ORG CDA  ] 's belief that there is no market for [MISC Icelandic  ] whale in [LOC Japan  ] . 
The Minister responded that this was a sovereignty issue and that [LOC Iceland  ] is a coastal nation that is using all its marine resources sustainably . 
He noted his political party is generally against whaling and the government is redoing the country 's whaling laws , which date from 1947 . 
He also said the government has tasked the University of [ORG Iceland Economic Institute  ] to create a cost and benefits report on whaling , which the Minister expects to use to develop a new whaling policy at the end of this whaling season . 
Regarding the reported absence of a whale meat market overseas , the Minister said that marketing was a private commercial issue which did not concern the government. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: The apparent lack of a market for fin whale meat does not seem to be affecting the hunt . 
The [MISC Icelandic  ] government , despite being composed of two political parties opposed to whaling , is preoccupied with other issues related to the financial crisis and possible [ORG European Union  ] membership . 
At a minimum , it will take a strong multi-national response to affect any change , and even then it seems unlikely the whaling will stop this season .
