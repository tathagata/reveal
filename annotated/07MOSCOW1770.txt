The first case claims that [PER Khodorkovskiy  ] was arrested and held in pre-trial detention in violation of the [ORG European Convention  ] on [ORG Human Rights  ] ( the [ORG Convention  ] ) , while the second alleges violations of Khodorkovskiy’s right to a fair trial . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] maintained that the case against [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] is politically motivated and being run out of the [LOC Kremlin  ] , and does not foresee any change of status for [PER Khodorkovskiy  ] while the [ORG Putin Administration  ] remains in office . 
End Summary . 
The [MISC New Charges  ] --------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On February 16 , the General [ORG Procuracy  ] charged [PER Khodorkovskiy  ] and [PER Platon Lebedev  ] with embezzlement and money laundering ( Ref B ) . 
According to the indictment , [PER Khodorkovskiy  ] and [PER Lebedev  ] acquired controlling interests in three oil companies ( [LOC Samaraneftegaz  ] , [LOC Yuganskneftegaz  ] , and [ORG Tomskneftegaz  ] ) and then caused these companies to sell oil at below-market prices to other companies that they controlled without disclosing to other shareholders their role in these transactions . 
They then allegedly re-sold the oil at market prices , which were approximately 3-4 times greater than the original purchase price . 
The alleged victims were the other shareholders of [LOC Samaraneftegaz  ] , [LOC Yuganskneftegaz  ] , and [ORG Tomskneftegaz  ] , who were entitled to the benefit of an arms-length sale at market prices , but instead received only the artificially deflated prices allegedly set by [PER Khodorkovskiy  ] and [PER Lebedev  ] ( Ref B ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) As an initial matter , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that the new charges are simply a re-packaging of the charges in the first case . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] in the first case , prosecutors relied on the very same transactions to charge [PER Khodorkovskiy  ] with tax evasion . 
However , he said , they were unsatisfied with Khodorkovskiy’s eight-year sentence and decided to bring new charges carrying potentially heavier sentences . 
The money laundering charges carry a maximum sentence of 15 years and the embezzlement charges carry a maximum sentence of 10 years . 
He said the defense will challenge them on the grounds that they violate [MISC Russian  ] and international norms prohibiting double jeopardy . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also suggested that the new charges may have been brought to prevent [PER Khodorkovskiy  ] from being released on parole before upcoming [ORG Duma  ] and Presidential elections . 
( Note: [MISC Russian  ] law provides that a prisoner is eligible for early release after he has served half of his sentence . 
Because [PER Khodorkovskiy  ] was arrested in October 2003 and was sentenced to eight years , he might have been eligible for early release in October 2007 . 
However , his prison violations , which [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] claims were provoked by authorities , would likely have prevented his early release in any event . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also said that the new charges are without merit since this transfer pricing technique was not only legal but engaged in by “thousands of firms.” He noted that the business groups and industrial firms emerging from privatization during the 1990s were generally organized to take maximum advantage of benefits the [ORG GOR  ] provided via “internal offshore” zones . 
The headquarters and some operating units of a group or firm were typically located in identified havens and conducted most of the transactions , thus allowing for tax optimization . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] this structure facilitated and encouraged the widespread practice of transfer pricing , whereby one part of a company [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00001770 002 OF 003 purchased the output made by another part of the company at below-market prices before selling the same output at a market price. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] defense would present substantial documentary evidence , including records of corporate meetings , proving that the minority shareholders of [LOC Samaraneftegaz  ] , [LOC Yuganskneftegaz  ] , and [ORG Tomskneftegaz  ] were fully informed of all relevant aspects of the subject transactions . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also claimed that if the minority shareholders had actually been defrauded , as prosecutors claim , they would have filed civil suits , which they did not do . 
Finally , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that the prosecution’s claim of a [ORG USD  ] 30 billion loss to the shareholders is &absurd8 because the sum would represent the total value of all the oil produced by the subject companies during the relevant time period rather than the difference between what the minority shareholders actually received and what they would have received in arms-length transactions , which , he said , would have been much a more sensible way to measure the alleged loss . 
The [MISC Trial: Where and When  ] ? -------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [ORG Procuracy  ] filed the new charges in [LOC Chita  ] , where [PER Khodorkovskiy  ] is presently incarcerated , and sought to conduct the preliminary investigation and trial there ( Ref B ) . 
Shortly after the new charges were filed , the defense filed a motion seeking a change of venue to [LOC Moscow  ] , claiming that the majority of witnesses and evidence are located there . 
On March 20 , the [ORG Basmanny Court  ] in [LOC Moscow  ] granted the defense motion . 
The [ORG Procuracy  ] appealed this decision and the appeal was heard on April 16 in the [LOC Moscow City Court  ] . 
This Court upheld the [ORG Basmanny Court’s  ] decision transferring the case to [LOC Moscow  ] . 
[MISC XXXXXXXXXXXX Russian  ] law provides that the preliminary investigation should be conducted in the place where the crime was allegedly committed , but may be conducted in the place where the defendant is located to ensure &completeness , objectivity and compliance with procedural norms.” <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] claimed that the [ORG Procuracy  ] chose [LOC Chita  ] to make it difficult for the defense team to meet with their clients and prepare their defense . 
Specifically , he said , [LOC Chita  ] is difficult to reach and lacks the copying machines and other office equipment the defense needs to prepare its case . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that although the Procuracy’s decision was clearly wrong as a matter of law , he was surprised by the [ORG Basmanny Court’s  ] decision because the same court had consistently ruled against [PER Khodorkovskiy  ] in the first case . 
He claimed that the ruling was an indication of a general recognition that the [ORG Procuracy  ] had “gone too far.” <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also said that he did not know when the trial on the new charges would take place . 
He said that the prosecution had sought to start the trial in June so that it would be completed before the elections , but noted that the case materials consist of 127 volumes and said that the [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that the prosecutors will likely move to cut off the defense’s review of the case file in May , but said that the defense would challenge such a motion . 
Under [MISC Russian  ] law , the prosecution can seek to limit the time that the defense has to review the case file if there are grounds to believe that the defense is engaging in unreasonable delay . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also said that a trial date could not be set until the location of the trial had been determined . 
Therefore , because of ongoing litigation regarding the venue of the trial and the voluminous nature of the case file , it is not clear when the case will proceed to trial . 
The [ORG European Court of Human Rights  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also said that [PER Khodorkovskiy  ] has filed two complaints to the [ORG ECHR  ] in [LOC Strasbourg  ] alleging violations of his rights under the [ORG Convention  ] in the first case . 
The [ORG ECHR  ] in [LOC Strasbourg  ] adjudicates claims brought under the [ORG Convention  ] . 
As a result of [MISC Russia’s  ] ratification of the [ORG Convention  ] in 1998 , [LOC Russia  ] is bound by the [ORG Convention  ] and any [ORG ECHR  ] decisions interpreting it . 
The first complaint , he said , [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00001770 003 OF 003 alleges that [PER Khodorkovskiy  ] was arrested and held in pre-trial detention in violation of the [ORG Convention  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that the [ORG ECHR  ] had agreed to hear this case on an accelerated timetable , but had not yet set a date. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The second complaint , he said , alleges violations of [LOC Khodorkovskiy’s  ] right to a fair trial . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] explained that before adjudicating a case , the [ORG ECHR  ] typically sends a list of specific questions about the movant’s claims to the respondent government . 
According to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] the [MISC Russian  ] government has not yet responded to the ECHR’s questions regarding the second complaint and it is therefore not clear when this case will be considered . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also said that the second complaint is “more interesting” than the first because , if successful , it could result in a reversal of [LOC Khodorkovskiy’s  ] conviction . 
By contrast , the first claim could only result in an award of monetary damages . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also noted that the [MISC French  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Moscow  ] and [MISC German  ] Bundestag have shown interest in this case . 
No Changes Expected ------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) In his final remarks , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] claimed that the new charges against [PER Khodorkovskiy  ] are politically motivated and said that the case is being orchestrated entirely by the [LOC Kremlin  ] . 
Although he stated confidently that the charges are without legal or evidentiary support , he concluded by saying that [PER Khodorkovskiy  ] would likely remain in prison as long as the [ORG Putin Administration  ] is in power .
