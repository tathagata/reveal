[LOC Iceland  ] , s [ORG New Defense Agency  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Delegation Head  ] , Ambassador and Director of the [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG MFA Defense Department  ] Ambassador [PER Thorir Ibsen  ] said that the June launch of the [ORG Icelandic Defense Agency  ] was intended to consolidate all defense-related matters formerly found in offices throughout the [ORG MFA  ] into a single agency . 
The [ORG Defense Agency  ] will be subordinate to the [ORG MFA  ] 's [ORG Defense Department  ] and will execute [LOC Iceland  ] , s defense activities while the [ORG Defense Department  ] continues in its policy role . 
The [PER Agency  ] will serve as a framework for approaching issues related to security changes in the [LOC High North  ] and will be responsible for operation of the [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG Air Defense System  ] ( [ORG IADS  ] ) radars and [LOC Iceland  ] , s participation in [LOC NATO.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG Foreign Policy Advisor  ] to the Prime Minister [PER Sturla Sigurjonsson  ] said the government will spend the next 3-4 years on coordination of the [ORG Defense Agency  ] and after that on its evolution . 
Prior to the establishment of the [ORG Agency  ] , there was no legal basis for the [MISC Icelandic  ] government to perform any defense-related operations . 
Director of Police and [ORG Judicial Affairs  ] at the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] [PER Thorunn Hafstein  ] said that creation of the [ORG Defense Agency  ] was an important legal step that would offer the [ORG MOJ  ] greater opportunities than ever before for coordination on Police , [ORG Coast Guard  ] and search and rescue . 
[ORG Air Policing Cooperation  ] ------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Ibsen  ] welcomed the upcoming [LOC U.S.  ] deployment for [ORG Northern Viking  ] air policing exercises set for September . 
[LOC Norway  ] recently sent a team to provide air traffic control training in advance of the exercises . 
[ORG OSD Policy Office  ] Director [PER Todd Harvey  ] said the [LOC United States  ] is looking forward to the [ORG Northern Viking  ] deployment and said [ORG DOD  ] wants to foster closer cooperation and to enhance interoperability with a focus on [ORG IADS  ] radar , air policing , and exercises . 
[ORG DOD  ] noted that the final planning conference for [ORG Northern Viking  ] will take place in [LOC Keflavik  ] June 25-26 .

[ORG OSD  ] [PER Todd Harvey  ] said that [ORG U/S Edelman  ] had recommended that [LOC Iceland  ] seek [ORG NATO  ] funding for upgrades through its security and investment program . 
[PER Ibsen  ] said that [LOC Iceland  ] would support such an effort but was not willing to lead it , instead asking that the [LOC U.S.  ] lead . 
Regarding pricing for spare parts [LOC Iceland  ] wants to purchase to maintain existing [ORG IADS  ] radar , [PER Harvey  ] noted that the overriding goal is to preserve the radars as fully functioning and able to serve their purpose . 
He said [ORG OSD  ] was nearing the end of a pricing review for spare parts and hoped soon to have a final price . 
[PER Ibsen  ] emphasized the importance of coming to a conclusion as quickly as possible . 
[ORG Coast Guard Cooperation  ] ------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG MOJ  ] , s [PER Hafstein  ] pointed to the rapid increase in vessels transiting the region combined with dangerous sea conditions as a strong motivation for [LOC Iceland  ] to pursue cooperation with the [ORG USCG  ] . 
The traffic increase heightens the need for search and rescue ( [ORG SAR  ] ) capabilities , maritime domain awareness , and &command of sea lanes.8 [PER Hafstein  ] said [LOC Iceland  ] , s [ORG Coast Guard  ] ( [ORG ICG  ] ) enjoys a 24/7 link with [ORG USCG  ] [LOC Boston  ] and that cooperation is outstanding. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Hafstein  ] reported [LOC Iceland  ] will chair the [ORG North Atlantic Coast Guard Forum  ] ( [ORG NACGF  ] ) beginning in September , calling it the most important maritime forum in which her agency participates . 
She said [LOC Iceland  ] also supports creating [ORG Regional Maritime Security Operations Centers  ] in the [LOC North Atlantic  ] , separate from the [ORG NACGF  ] . 
[LOC Iceland  ] is willing to host such a center and would welcome [ORG USCG  ] participation. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG USCG  ] presented a draft [ORG MOU  ] for Cooperation ( a counterproposal in response to a draft presented by the [ORG ICG  ] to the [ORG USCG  ] last year ) .

( C ) [ORG Foreign Policy Advisor  ] to the Prime Minister [PER Sturla Sigurjonsson  ] expressed concerns over developments in the [LOC High North  ] affecting transport of energy resources and indicated uncertainty as to the degree to which [ORG NATO  ] should focus on energy . 
EEB [PER Stephen Gallogly  ] said there is ongoing discussion in the [ORG USG  ] , but the focus for energy discussions is still within [ORG IAEA  ] rather than [ORG NATO  ] . 
[LOC Iceland  ] , s Ambassador to [LOC Washington  ] [PER Albert Jonsson  ] commented on the considerable geothermal resources in the [LOC United States  ] and noted [MISC Icelandic  ] investment and cooperation in developing such projects in [LOC California  ] . 
[LOC Russia  ] ------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Sigurjonsson  ] referred to [LOC Iceland  ] , s longstanding good relations with [LOC Russia  ] , calling it a neighbor . 
He reminded that &Iceland is a very small country that must take care in its approach to [MISC Russia.8  ] He nevertheless expressed some concern about the recent , more aggressive posture [LOC Russia  ] has taken , in particular citing [MISC Russian  ] long range aviation activity that has encroached on [LOC Iceland  ] , s civil aviation space. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Sigurjonsson  ] said it was no coincidence that one of the initial [MISC Russian  ] flights took place the day after NAS [LOC Keflavik  ] closed and stated that the current situation is very different than that during the [MISC Cold War  ] . 
Now flights are much closer to [LOC Iceland  ] , and there is far denser civil aviation activity in the area than in the past . 
[PER Sigurjonsson  ] said [MISC Russian  ] flights have come as close as 35 miles to [LOC Reykjavik  ] and showed a graphic demonstrating a recent flight that had circumnavigated the country . 
While concerned that [MISC Russian  ] motivations could include claiming a stake to the [LOC North Atlantic  ] , he said that [LOC Iceland  ] , s main worry is for the safety of civil aviation . 
[LOC Iceland  ] does not see increased [MISC Russian  ] LRA activity as a military threat . 
Committed to [LOC Afghanistan  ] ------------------------ <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Ibsen  ] said [LOC Iceland  ] needs to better focus its contribution in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , which currently comprises 14 non-combat troops supporting a [MISC PRT  ] , ISAF HQ and [LOC Kabul  ] airport operations , and added that that &funding is not yet clear.8 [PER Ibsen  ] said [LOC Iceland  ] was glad to be joining [LOC Norway  ] at the [MISC PRT  ] in [LOC Meymaneh  ] and indicated that it was also interested in assisting with police training . 
The government plans to unveil a three-year strategy for [LOC Afghanistan  ] in June , which will spell out a longer term , more focused commitment . 
[LOC Iceland  ] was pleased with the choice of [PER Kai Eide  ] as [ORG UN  ] envoy in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Sigurjonsson  ] noted that [LOC Iceland  ] had previously pledged $1 million to the [LOC UK  ] for heavy airlift which had not yet been used . 
Consequently , [LOC Iceland  ] plans to transfer $500,000 to a UK-sponsored [ORG NATO  ] helicopter fund . 
[ORG NATO Seminar  ] on [LOC High North  ] -------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Sigurjonsson  ] said [LOC Iceland  ] is planning a [ORG NATO  ] seminar for January 2009 and it wants to &make the [LOC High North  ] a [ORG NATO  ] issue.8 He reported that the [ORG NATO  ] Secretary General will attend and [LOC Iceland  ] is expecting high level participation from countries including [LOC Denmark  ] , [LOC Norway  ] and [LOC Canada  ] . 
[LOC Iceland  ] hopes also for good representation by the [LOC United States  ] , though [PER Sigurjonsson  ] acknowledged that timing would be problematic . 
Planning for the meeting is being coordinated through staff at [ORG NATO  ] HQ . 
[PER Sigurjonsson  ] asked for a [ORG POC  ] at State with whom [LOC Iceland  ] can work on developing the program . 
[PER Sigurjonsson  ] said [LOC Iceland  ] plans to limit attendance to the [ORG NATO  ] 26 because the &discussion would be different8 if broadened to include [ORG NATO  ] partners ( which would necessarily include [LOC Russia  ] ) . 
Police Cooperation ------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [ORG MOJ  ] [PER Hafstein  ] said a [ORG National Police Security Unit  ] was created in January of 2007 and has since produced threat assessments on domestic terrorism -- which not surprisingly have been unalarming. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
[PER Hafstein  ] asked for an assessment of the organized crime threat posed by increased [MISC Chinese  ] and [MISC Russian  ] immigration . 
[ORG FBI Eurasian Organized Crime Unit  ] Chief [PER Barry Braun  ] cautioned that [MISC Russian  ] money laundering could become a serious problem and that securing cooperation from the [MISC Russian  ] government on information sharing could be challenging .
