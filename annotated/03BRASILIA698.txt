Summary . 
Post recommends that [LOC Brazil  ] remain on the [ORG Priority Watch List  ] for the 2003 Special 301 Review . 
New attention to entrenched [ORG IPR  ] problems , particularly in the copyright area , may be forthcoming under the new [PER Lula  ] government . 
Driven largely by concern over lost tax revenues , impact on formal sector jobs , and harm to [MISC Brazilian  ] artists , the new administration , which assumed office January 1 , has publicly acknowledged rampant piracy and counterfeiting to be a [MISC Brazilian  ] problem , and has vowed action . 
However , it is too early to assess the [ORG GOB  ] 's new level of commitment . 
Furthermore , despite some positive groundwork laid by the [ORG Cardoso  ] administration , the level of [ORG IPR  ] enforcement within [LOC Brazil  ] remained grossly inadequate during the last year . 
Despite its new leadership and staffing , the [ORG Inter-Ministerial Committee  ] for Fighting Piracy ( [ORG IMC  ] ) has not yet proven its capacity for effecting substantial , tangible improvements in copyright enforcement . 
Likewise , the backlog of pharmaceutical patents continues to grow due to the two-step patent application process , which requires [ORG Ministry of Health approval  ] , and insufficient resources within [LOC Brazil  ] 's patent institute . 
Maintaining the status-quo on Special 301 status for [LOC Brazil  ] strikes the appropriate balance between recognition of a continued poor [ORG IPR  ] record , hopes that the new government will tackle the issue in earnest , and reinforcement of the [ORG USG  ] message that [ORG IPR  ] remains a priority within our bilateral agenda . 
Copyright - The Groundwork - [ORG Inter-Ministerial Committee:  ] An Enigma or Force for Change ? <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
As [MISC IIPA  ] notes in its submission , much stock was placed in the creation of the [ORG Inter-Ministerial Committee  ] to Fight Piracy ( [ORG IMC  ] ) in March 2001 . 
There was an expectation that the [ORG IMC  ] would provide the vehicle through which the [ORG GOB  ] could finally articulate and act on a national strategy for copyright enforcement . 
However , far from being a dynamic force for change , the [ORG IMC  ] was not a functioning entity in 2001 . 
Even [ORG GOB  ] officials have acknowledged the [ORG IMC  ] 's less than stellar 2001 performance , during a November 2002 Bilateral Consultative Mechanism meeting and more recently in meetings with [ORG DOC A/S  ] Lash on February 27 . 
While copyright industries are correct in asserting that tangible results still remained elusive in 2002 , the following changes in the [ORG IMC  ] should be noted as having positive potential. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
In March 2002 , a new coordinator , [ORG Clovis  ] da [PER Silva Monteiro  ] , was named to head the [ORG IMC  ] . 
[PER Monteiro  ] was tasked solely with running the [ORG IMC  ] , in contrast to his predecessor , who had retained his drug-fighting responsibilities as a senior police official in [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] during his [ORG IMC  ] tenure . 
[PER Monteiro  ] established within the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] an [ORG IMC  ] office staffed with four assistants , and had managed to convene 10 [ORG IMC  ] meetings by the end of 2002 , many with private sector representatives . 
In November 2002 , the [ORG IMC  ] produced an action plan for 2003 ( USTR received a copy during the Bilateral Consultative Mechanism meeting the same month ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
The action plan , a nine-page document , on first read appears to suffer from over-generality ; actions are only described in broad terms . 
For example , one action item is to examine existing proposals for legislative reform and to identify the need to improve other legal texts . 
The item fails to provide [ORG IMC  ] views on specific [ORG IPR  ] legislative proposals or to identify actions to promote their adoption or defeat . 
This generality , at least in part , reflects the fact that the [ORG IMC  ] is a coordinating body ) it does not have the authority to direct action by any other government body. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
As explained by [PER Elza Marcelino de Castro  ] , chief of [ORG Itamaraty  ] 's [ORG Intellectual Property Division  ] and [ORG Itamaraty  ] 's representative to the [ORG IMC  ] , specific actions are not identified in the [ORG IMC  ] action plan because implementation is the responsibility of the individual ministries that comprise the group . 
She notes , for instance , that after [ORG IMC  ] discussions and consensus , [ORG Itamaraty  ] recently sent a note to the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Congress  ] urging action on long-pending legislation on integrated circuitry . 
She also claims that an action plan with greater specificity exists , but is not public . 
Likewise , it is difficult to find the imprint of the [ORG IMC  ] on police enforcement actions . 
[PER Monteiro  ] , who hails from the [ORG Federal Police  ] corps , claims to be intimately involved in promoting and coordinating police activity country-wide . 
He admits , however , that he generally obtains results more from drawing on his personal credibility and experience within law enforcement than as head of the [LOC IMC.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
[PER Monteiro  ] has apparently succeeded in elevating [ORG IPR  ] as an issue within [MISC Mercosul  ] . 
Due to his efforts , [ORG IPR  ] was included for the first time within a [ORG Mercosul Presidential Declaration  ] during the group 's summit in [LOC Brasilia  ] in December 2002 . 
[ORG Itamaraty  ] has confirmed that the issue is on the [ORG Mercosul  ] agenda for follow-up at the ministerial level . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's actions in this regard are driven by its concern over pirated materials being smuggled across its borders , principally from [LOC Paraguay.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
Another action under [ORG IMC  ] discussion is formation of a task force to deal with counterfeit products . 
In a conference on [ORG IPR  ] enforcement held in [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] in late November 2002 , tax losses and potential harm to consumers from counterfeit products figured prominently . 
A representative of [LOC Receita Federal  ] , the [ORG GOB  ] 's [ORG IRS  ] , was quoted extensively on the substantial tax losses from counterfeit products , principally cigarettes and gasoline . 
Given the federal government 's tight budget situation and focus on tax issues , greater [ORG GOB  ] attention can logically be expected in this area during the coming months. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
The [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] is reportedly looking into the possibility of forming a task force comprised of representatives from the country 's various police units . 
This would be a welcome complement to the more policy-oriented [ORG IMC  ] . 
[PER Monteiro  ] also claims that the [ORG IMC  ] is encouraging other municipalities to establish [ORG IPR  ] task forces , similar to [LOC Sao Paulo  ] 's , but admits that convincing local authorities with tight resources that investments should be made in this area is an uphill battle. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
An area of increasing focus by some of the copyright industries is [LOC Brazil  ] 's judicial system , in particular , the lack of convictions and of deterrent sentencing . 
According to [ORG Itamaraty  ] 's [PER de Castro  ] , while establishment of separate [ORG IPR  ] courts is not envisioned , the [ORG IMC  ] is discussing how to cultivate [ORG IPR  ] expertise within the judicial system . 
She notes , however , that executive branch initiatives in this area are not always welcomed by the independent judiciary. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
While the [ORG IMC  ] 's lack of overarching authority will continue to undermine its ability to forcefully carry out a nation-wide strategy for improving [ORG IPR  ] protection within [LOC Brazil  ] , it still represents the best vehicle at present for focusing [ORG IPR  ] enforcement issues at the federal level . 
Private sector associations interested in [ORG IPR  ] issues are seeking increased involvement in the work of the [ORG IMC  ] , with some requesting a seat on the committee . 
Enhanced involvement in the [ORG IMC  ] by the private sector could lead to better focus and more concrete results. -Optical [ORG Media: New Digital Codes Requirement  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
The promulgation of [ORG Presidential Decree  ] 4533 on December 19 , 2002 provides implementing regulations for Article 113 of [LOC Brazil  ] 's 1998 Copyright Law concerning identification codes for copyright products . 
The decree requires that music and audiovisual works , whether optically read or not , include codes identifying the original work , the production company , catalogue number , the lot code and number of copies contained within the lot , as well as an [ORG International Standard Recording Code  ] providing information on the respective artists and other information provided by the producer . 
The decree is due to become effective April 22 , 2003 . 
Local industry is divided on whether or not this requirement will prove to be an effective [ORG IPR  ] enforcement tool , or merely a mechanism for better accounting between production companies and artists . 
The local software industry association ( [ORG ABES  ] ) , for instance , opposes the decree . 
However , [PER Castro  ] argues that the decree will help reduce illegal sales of works that are stolen from legitimate production facilities , which she claims have been significant . 
Patents ) No Recovery Expected Soon <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
Despite [ORG GOB  ] officials -- such as the acting head of [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG National Institute of Industrial Property  ] ( [ORG INPI  ] ) , Minister [PER Furlan  ] who oversees [ORG INPI  ] as the head of the [ORG Ministry of Development  ] , [ORG Industry and Trade  ] ( [ORG MDIC  ] ) , Under-Secretary Hugueney of [ORG Itamaraty  ] 's [ORG U/S of Integration , Economics and Trade  ] , and [PER Senator Mercadante  ] ( [ORG PT  ] ) - recently acknowledging the magnitude of the problem , no immediate reduction in the pharmaceutical patent backlog is expected . 
Firm figures on [ORG INPI  ] 's pending patent applications are hard to come by , but [ORG PhRMA  ] 's estimate of 45,000 pending patent applications , of which approximately 18,000 are pharmaceutical patents , appears reasonable. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
[ORG INPI  ] claims the backlog is due to its lack of resources ; [ORG INPI  ] currently has 80 examiners and only a few computer terminals . 
[ORG INPI  ] has requested approval from the central [ORG GOB  ] to hire 350 examiners over the next five years and expand its number of computers . 
However , the government 's tight budget situation casts doubt on the likelihood of this occurring . 
Even [ORG Itamaraty  ] 's [PER de Castro  ] admitted to econoff that without a dramatic increase in resources for [ORG INPI  ] , the patent backlog will persist for many years . 
[ORG INPI  ] is currently training 27 new examiners , 20 of which will reportedly focus on pharmaceutical patents . 
The required approval of the [ORG Ministry of Health  ] 's regulatory agency , [ORG ANVISA  ] , in addition to raising [ORG TRIPS  ] compliance concerns , also adds to patent processing uncertainty and delays . 
However , in a February 27 meeting with [ORG DOC A/S Lash  ] , Hugueney reported that the [ORG GOB  ] will be initiating a review in March of its policy regarding [ORG ANVISA  ] 's role in the patent approval process . 
Biotechnology <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
As noted in the [ORG American Soybean Association  ] 's ( [ORG ASA  ] ) Special 301 submission , piracy associated with [LOC Roundup Ready  ] has been a burgeoning trend . 
Past denial by the [ORG GOB  ] of the existence of illegal plantings of [LOC Roundup Ready  ] , which is estimated to have reached as high as 70 to 90 percent of the soybean crop in the state of [LOC Rio Grande  ] do Sul , has hindered [ORG Monsanto  ] 's ability to exercise its patent rights . 
The [PER Lula  ] administration has recently recognized the widespread use of [LOC Roundup Ready  ] and is deliberating on what to do about the " illegal " GMO plantings within the 2002-2003 crop . 
It is unclear at this point to what extent if any this acknowledgment of the pervasive use of [LOC Roundup Ready  ] will assist [ORG Monsanto  ] in pursuing its patent claims . 
[ORG TRIPS Compliance: Data Confidentiality  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
On December 17 , 2002 , the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Congress  ] passed Law 10,603 intending to bring the data confidentiality portions of the industrial property law fully in line with [ORG TRIPS  ] . 
The law provides data protection for 10 years from the date of patent registration for products utilizing new chemical molecules or new biological organisms or until the first release of the information by the patent holder , with a minimum guaranteed period of protection of one year . 
For products not utilizing new molecule or organisms , the period of protection is five years or until the first release of information by the patent holder with a one-year minimum period of protection . 
For data generated after patent registration , the period of protection will coincide with the patent period or one year from when the data was divulged , whichever is longer . 
[ORG USTR  ] is evaluating whether or not the legislation is [ORG TRIPS  ] compliant . 
[PER Treaty Ratification  ] <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
[ORG Itamaraty  ] has confirmed that the [ORG GOB  ] does not currently have plans to ratify the 1996 [ORG WIPO Copyright Treaty  ] or the [ORG WIPO Performances  ] and [ORG Phonograms Treaty  ] . 
Recommendation <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
Post believes that the lack of tangible improvements in [ORG IPR  ] protection and enforcement in the last year manifestly precludes lowering [LOC Brazil  ] 's Special 301 status . 
We concur with industry submissions that suggest that retaining [LOC Brazil  ] as a [ORG Priority Watch List  ] country will appropriately highlight for the new government the importance of the issue in our bilateral relationship , without appearing to prejudge its policies and actions in this area . 
Nonetheless , we request that , should [LOC Brazil  ] 's status be maintained , [ORG USTR  ] 's announcement highlight the [ORG USG  ] 's recognition of the positive intentions expressed by the [PER Lula  ] administration regarding [ORG IPR  ] and the [ORG USG  ] 's desire to work collaboratively with it to improve its [ORG IPR  ] regime in the coming year .
