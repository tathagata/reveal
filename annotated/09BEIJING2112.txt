Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) The need for consensus and the desire to protect vested interests are the main drivers of [ORG Politburo Standing Committee  ] ( [ORG PBSC  ] ) decision-making and [MISC Chinese  ] leadership dynamics in general , according to Embassy contacts with access to leadership circles . 
Contacts have variously described relations at the top of [LOC China  ] 's Party-state structure as akin to those in the executive suite of a large corporation , as determined by the interplay of powerful interests , or as shaped by competition between " princelings " with family ties to party elders and " shopkeepers " who have risen through the ranks of the Party . 
End Summary . 
[PER Hu Jintao  ] as Chairman of the [ORG Board  ] ? ----------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG Chinese Communist Party  ] ( [ORG CCP  ] ) [ORG Politburo  ] decision-making is similar to executive decision-making in a large company , two well-connected contacts say. xxxxx that Party General Secretary [PER Hu Jintao  ] could be compared to the Chairman of the [ORG Board  ] or CEO of a big corporation.xxxxx , used the same analogy in a May 18 meeting with [ORG PolOffs.  ] xxxxx said that [ORG PBSC  ] decision making was akin to a corporation in which the greater the stock ownership the greater the voice in decisions . 
" [PER Hu Jintao  ] holds the most stock , so his views carry the greatest weight , " and so on down the hierarchy , but the [ORG PBSC  ] did not formally vote , xxxxx . 
" It is a consensus system , " he maintained , " in which members can exercise veto power . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) xxxxx had told [MISC PolOff  ] previously that he knew " on very good authority " that " major policies , " such as the country 's core policy on [LOC Taiwan  ] or [LOC North Korea  ] , had to be decided by the full 25-member [ORG Politburo  ] . 
Other more specific matters , he said , were decided by the nine-member [ORG PBSC  ] alone . 
Some issues were put to a formal vote , while others were merely discussed until a consensus was reached . 
Either way , xxxxx stated sarcastically , the [ORG Politburo  ] was the " most democratic body in the world , " the only place in [LOC China  ] where true democracy existed. xxxxx said that although there was " something " to the notion of a rough factional balancing at the top between the [PER Jiang Zemin-Shanghai  ] group and the [MISC Hu-Wen  ] group , neither group was dominant , and major issues had to be decided by consensus . 
Leadership Dynamics: Driven by Vested Interests --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) xxxxx asserted to [MISC PolOff  ] March 12 that the Party should be viewed primarily as a collection of interest groups . 
There was no " reform wing , " xxxxx claimed.xxxxx made the same argument in several discussions with [MISC PolOff  ] over the past year , asserting that [LOC China  ] 's top leadership had carved up [LOC China  ] 's economic " pie , " creating an ossified system in which " vested interests " drove decision-making and impeded reform as leaders maneuvered to ensure that those interests were not threatened . 
It was " well known , " xxxxx stated , that former Premier [PER Li Peng  ] and his family controlled all electric power interests ; [ORG PBSC  ] member and security czar [PER Zhou Yongkang  ] and associates controlled the oil interests ; the late former top leader [PER Chen Yun  ] 's family controlled most of the [LOC PRC  ] 's banking sector ; [ORG PBSC  ] member and [MISC Chinese  ] People 's [ORG Political Consultative Conference  ] Chairman [PER Jia Qinglin  ] was the main interest behind major [LOC Beijing  ] real estate developments ; [PER Hu Jintao  ] 's son-in -law ran [ORG Sina.com  ] ; and [PER Wen Jiabao  ] 's wife controlled [LOC China  ] 's precious gems sector. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Note: In a development that could fan the " vested interest " rumor mill , [MISC China-related  ] websites in the [LOC United States  ] this week were reporting that a [MISC Chinese  ] security technology company with links to [PER Hu  ] 's eldest son , [PER Hu Haifeng  ] , was being investigated in [LOC Namibia  ] on charges of corruption . 
A July 19 article in a [MISC Malaysian  ] paper , cited by a [MISC U.S.-based  ] dissident website , wenxuecity.com , reported that [PER Hu Haifeng  ] was a " potential witness " in the case but was not himself a suspect . 
The report said that the younger [PER Hu  ] was a former CEO of [LOC Nuctech  ] and currently the Party Secretary of its [LOC Beijing  ] 00002112 002 of 002 parent company , [ORG Tsinghua Holding Co  ] . 
Ltd . 
According to the [LOC China  ] Digital Times website at the [ORG University of California Berkeley  ] 's [ORG China Internet Project  ] , the [ORG Central Propaganda Department  ] on July 21 issued orders to block any reference to the case in the [LOC PRC  ] media . 
End note. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) xxxxx , had told [MISC PolOff  ] earlier that leaders had close ties to powerful economic actors , especially real estate developers and corporate leaders , who in some cases were officials themselves . 
The same was true at the local level , xxxxx stated . 
He claimed that these interest networks had policy implications since most local leaders had " bought " their positions and wanted an immediate financial " return " on their investment . 
They always supported fast-growth policies and opposed reform efforts that might harm their interests , xxxxx . 
Vested interests were especially inclined to oppose media openness , he said , lest someone question the shady deals behind land transactions . 
As a result , the proponents of " growth first " would always be in a stronger position than those who favored controlling inflation or taking care of the poor , xxxxx. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) xxxxx that the central feature of leadership politics was the need to protect oneself and one 's family from attack after leaving office . 
Thus , current leaders carefully cultivated proteges who would defend their interests once they stepped down . 
It was natural , xxxxx said , that someone like [PER Xi Jinping  ] , who maintained a non-threatening low profile and had never made enemies , would be elevated by [PER Jiang Zemin  ] and [PER Zeng Qinghong  ] . 
[PER Xi  ] would act to ensure that [PER Jiang  ] was not harassed or that [PER Jiang  ] 's corrupt son would not be arrested , xxxxx . 
Princelings vs. Shopkeepers --------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) xxxxx , separately described leadership alignments at the top of the [ORG CCP  ] as shaped largely by one 's " princeling " or " shopkeeper " lineage . 
In separate conversations in recent months , xxxxx said that some argued that [LOC China  ] 's " princelings , " the sons and daughters of prominent [ORG Communist Party  ] officials , including many who helped found the [LOC PRC  ] , shared a perception that they , as the descendents of those who shed blood in the name of the [MISC Communist  ] revolution , had a " right " to continue to lead [LOC China  ] and protect the fruits of that revolution . 
Such a mindset could potentially place the " princelings " at odds with Party members who do not have similar pedigrees , xxxxx , such as President [PER Hu Jintao  ] , Premier [PER Wen Jiabao  ] and Party members with a CYL background , who were derisively referred to as " shopkeepers' sons . 
" xxxxx had heard some princeling families denounce those without revolutionary pedigrees by saying , " While my father was bleeding and dying for [LOC China  ] , your father was selling shoelaces .
