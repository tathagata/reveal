( U ) This is an action message . 
Please see paragraph 3. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) Poloffs delivered non-paper providing additional information on [ORG Telstar  ] on November 10 to the [MISC Spanish  ] Foreign Ministry 's director general for international economic relations , [PER Javier Hergueta  ] . 
[PER Hergueta  ] said [ORG Telstar  ] is willing to cooperate fully with the [ORG USG  ] to have sanctions removed . 
He expressed concern , however , that the report was inaccurate . 
He explained that [ORG Telstar  ] did sell the freeze dryer and spare parts to [LOC Iran  ] . 
However , according to [PER Hergueta  ] , the transaction occurred in January 2003 ( not January 2004 as stated in the non-paper ) before the [MISC Iranian  ] end-user was known as [ORG Exir Pharmaceuticals  ] and before the [ORG EU  ] passed legislation that defined the transferred equipment as dual use goods subject to export licensing restrictions . 
[PER Hergueta  ] reiterated [ORG Telstar  ] 's willingness to halt future transfers of its goods to [LOC Iran  ] , and to otherwise cooperate as necessary to have the [ORG USG  ] sanctions removed . 
He proposed to set up a meeting between [MISC Emboffs  ] , [ORG MFA  ] officials , and [ORG Telstar  ] representatives to discuss this case in greater detail. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) Action request: Embassy understands this case is being discussed between [ORG NP  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] embassy officials in [LOC Washington  ] for possible review by an interagency group . 
We seek Department 's guidance as to whether a meeting in Madrid between [MISC Emboffs  ] , [ORG MFA  ] officials and [ORG Telstar  ] is desirable . 
End comment .
