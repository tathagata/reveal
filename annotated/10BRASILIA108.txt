The [ORG Ministry of External Relations  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) sought to put that letter in perspective with the following press release , which it posted on its website simultaneously with the letter to the [ORG UNFCCC  ] . 
BEGIN TEXT OF PRESS RELEASE The 15th [MISC Conference of the Parties  ] ( [MISC COP-15  ] ) of the [ORG UN Convention  ] on [ORG Climate Change  ] ( [ORG UNFCC  ] ) took place in [LOC Copenhagen  ] , [LOC Denmark  ] , in December 2009 . 
There , a group of countries negotiated a political document entitled the [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] . 
Although the [ORG Accord  ] did not constitute an ideal solution , it offered elements for future discussion in the negotiations of a [ORG Climate Change Convention  ] . 
The [ORG Accord  ] was not adopted by the [MISC Conference of the Parties  ] , which limited itself to taking note of its existence . 
The document establishes that , by January 31 , 2010 , the countries that are [MISC Parties  ] to [LOC Annex I  ] ( developed countries ) should register their emissions reductions target for 2020 and the countries that are not [MISC Parties  ] to [LOC Annex I  ] ( developing countries ) , such as [LOC Brazil  ] , should inform [ the [ORG UNFCCC  ] ] of the national emissions reduction actions that they intend to take . 
In the spirit of transparency and international cooperation , [LOC Brazil  ] informed the [ORG UNFCCC Secretariat  ] today , January 29 , 2010 , of the nationally appropriate mitigation actions that the [MISC Brazilian  ] Government intends to implement . 
These actions were early announced by the Head of the [MISC Brazilian  ] delegation to [MISC COP-15  ] , Minister [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] .

( SBU ) COMMENT . 
The [ORG GOB  ] did timely notify the [ORG UNFCCC  ] of its [ORG NAMA  ] in accordance with the [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] . 
Further , the [ORG MRE  ] 's press release makes clear that the [ORG GOB  ] was doing so to honor the commitment it made as one of the negotiators of the [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] . 
However , the letter to the [ORG UNFCCC  ] does not link the notification of [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG NAMAs  ] to the [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] nor does it include a statement that [LOC Brazil  ] " associates " itself with the [ORG Accord  ] . 
Still , [LOC Brazil  ] is fully complying with the [ORG Accord  ] , albeit without using the label " associating . 
" END COMMENT .
