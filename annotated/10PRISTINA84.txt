( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY: [LOC Kosovo  ] celebrated the second anniversary of its independence on February 17 . 
These two years have seen political stability that has allowed the country to create legitimate new institutions , including the [ORG Constitutional Court  ] and the [ORG Kosovo Security Force  ] , and to start fulfilling its [ORG Ahtisaari Plan  ] obligations , such as decentralization . 
Challenges remain , and [ORG Pristina  ] and the international community must focus on moving the country towards eventual membership in the [MISC Euro-Atlantic  ] institutions that will act as a guarantor of [LOC Kosovo  ] 's viability and security . 
Progress towards [ORG European Union  ] membership and a role within [ORG NATO  ] will require a concerted focus on building institutions , strengthening the country 's system of justice , protecting its multi-ethnicity , and developing its economy . 
In each of these fields , [LOC Kosovo  ] has been active in laying foundations for progress . 
However , we cannot ignore that work remains . 
Political parties need to move beyond their regional bases for support and cooperate better in pursuit of national goals . 
The [ORG GOK  ] , with more effective support from [LOC EULEX  ] , needs to build on its initial reforms in the justice sector and intensify its anti-corruption efforts . 
[LOC Pristina  ] , with the help of the international community , wants to replicate the success of decentralization in southern [LOC Kosovo  ] that empowers [MISC Serb  ] communities and extend the same hope to northern [LOC Kosovo  ] , where [LOC Belgrade  ] maintains an illegal stranglehold on municipal governance . 
The [ORG GOK  ] must use its string of economic reforms and privatizations as a springboard to motivate private-sector growth . 
Eventual membership in the [ORG European Union  ] and other [MISC Euro-Atlantic  ] institutions will mitigate the challenge that [LOC Kosovo  ] 's small size poses . 
The largest threats to this agenda come both from [LOC Belgrade  ] and the risk that [LOC Brussels  ] will not use its influence there to compel [LOC Belgrade  ] 's greater cooperation in allowing [LOC Kosovo  ] to develop and strengthen . 
END SUMMARY [ORG KOSOVO  ] AT TWO YEARS ------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Republic of [LOC Kosovo  ] turned two years old on February 17 . 
It has been two years marked by a number of successes . 
Most notably , we have seen peace and government stability . 
[LOC Kosovo  ] has taken responsibility for ensuring its own democracy with elections that it ran on its own for the first time since the end of the conflict . 
[MISC Serbs  ] in southern [LOC Kosovo  ] participated in these elections and are starting to accept that their survival runs through [ORG Pristina  ] rather than [LOC Belgrade  ] . 
More [MISC Serbs  ] , in fact , cast ballots in [LOC Kosovo  ] 's municipal elections in November 2009 than in the illegitimate parallel elections for local [MISC Serbian  ] institutions that took place throughout the year . 
New institutions , like the [ORG Constitutional Court  ] , are standing up and starting to earn respect as legitimate bodies . 
Internationally , [LOC Kosovo  ] has secured membership in both the [ORG World Bank  ] and the [ORG International Monetary Fund  ] , and recognitions of [LOC Kosovo  ] 's independence now stand at 65 countries . 
At the [ORG International Court of Justice  ] , [LOC Kosovo  ] ( supported by many in the international community , including the [LOC United States  ] ) presented a strong case to challenge [LOC Belgrade  ] 's contention that the country 's independence fails to accord with international law , and we expect that even an ambiguous opinion from the [ORG Court  ] will open the door for more states to recognize the country 's independence. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In short , [LOC Kosovo  ] has much to celebrate on its independence day . 
We must not forget , however , that [LOC Kosovo  ] is a nascent state that still confronts challenges . 
Its stability is laudable , but its political scene is fractious as inexperienced political parties tend to elevate narrow interests above national goals . 
The legacy of conflict and socialism has weakened its institutions , and its economy remains a work in progress . 
[LOC Kosovo  ] continues to look to the international community for guidance , and it sees in this advice a path that will lead to eventual membership in the [MISC Euro-Atlantic  ] community of nations , an end-goal that will act as a guarantor of the country 's independence , viability , and stability . 
In helping [LOC Kosovo  ] ultimately realize both [ORG European Union  ] and [ORG NATO  ] membership , we need to focus our efforts in fostering the state 's institutions , developing the rule of law , promoting its multi-ethnicity , and strengthening its economy . 
BUILDING INSTITUTIONS [ORG PRISTINA  ] 00000084 002.2 OF 005 --------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Kosovo  ] 's two largest parties -- the [ORG Democratic Party of Kosovo  ] ( [ORG PDK  ] ) and the [ORG Democratic League of Kosovo  ] ( [ORG LDK  ] ) -- have coexisted in stable government since national elections in November <a id='par2007' href='#par2007'>¶</a>2007 . 
This stability has allowed the [ORG GOK  ] to focus on several post-independence institution building projects: embarking on decentralization , standing up the [ORG Kosovo Security Force  ] ( [ORG KSF  ] ) , and creating the [ORG Constitutional Court  ] , among others . 
The results have been positive . 
We have seen [MISC Serbs  ] turnout in large numbers to elect [MISC Serb  ] candidates for mayor and municipal assemblies in the new , [MISC Ahtisaari-mandated  ] , [MISC Serb  ] municipalities . 
The [ORG KSF  ] has broken ties with the legacy of the [ORG Kosovo Liberation Army  ] and is showing a commitment to becoming a multi-ethnic force with its new pan-Kosovo recruitment campaign . 
The [ORG Constitutional Court  ] has earned legitimacy as the final arbiter of elections-related disputes. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The stability allows us to focus on critical economic projects -- like the New [ORG Kosovo Power Plant  ] and the privatization of the state telecom , [ORG Post and Telecom of Kosovo  ] -- with a stable government partner focused on work rather than campaigning . 
It also gives us time to encourage [LOC Kosovo  ] politics to move beyond its post-conflict paradigm , when all parties focused on independence to the exclusion of other considerations . 
Left-right policy dimensions do not yet exist here . 
The large political parties have not yet developed policy platforms that extend beyond reaffirming promises to their core supporters . 
The [ORG LDK  ] still sees itself as the standard-bearer for late President [PER Ibrahim Rugova  ] . 
The [ORG PDK  ] and the Alliance for the Future of [LOC Kosovo  ] ( [LOC AAK  ] ) are outgrowths of the [ORG KLA  ] and continue to appeal to regional support bases . 
These lingering identities too often obfuscate priorities and encourage leaders , at times , to forget that national interests must take precedence . 
IMPORTANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW ----------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On February 16 , President [PER Sejdiu  ] appointed new [ORG Supreme Court  ] judges and prosecutors . 
This action builds on a years-long , continuing process of vetting for professional competence judges and prosecutors . 
The vetting process involves both [LOC Kosovo  ] and international community arbiters , and the [ORG GOK  ] 's full acceptance of the results shows a commitment to developing an independent judiciary that will start to fill the gaps that exist in [LOC Kosovo  ] 's rule-of-law institutions . 
A similar process of interviews and testing went into the selection of the [ORG Constitutional Court  ] justices last year , and we have seen this court grow in legitimacy over the past several months . 
It has already had its own minor [LOC Marbury  ] v. [LOC Madison  ] moment , exercising unchallenged authority over legislation that controls the funding of the state radio and television broadcaster . 
Although the ruling has invited critics and controversy , none of these critics has questioned the role that the Court has played . 
This is a significant step in shoring up the independence of the country 's judicial institutions. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) There remains a need for more progress . 
In January of this year one of [LOC Kosovo  ] 's most widely read newspapers noted in an editorial that [LOC Kosovo  ] 's system of justice needs deep reform . 
The [ORG GOK  ] , too , recognizes that it faces a challenge in developing its legal institutions , and the Prime Minister has adopted a legislative strategy for the year that prioritizes the rule of law . 
It is a strategy that will modernize and reform the court structure , invigorate the country 's prosecutorial ranks , and create an institutional foundation where objectivity has an opportunity to flourish . 
Concurrent with this legislative strategy , the [ORG GOK  ] -- with more active assistance from [ORG EULEX  ] -- will need to strengthen its anti-corruption efforts , a difficult challenge in a country this small , where businesses often claim a political patron . 
Despite the inherent difficulties , our institution-building efforts must prioritize the rule of law and the fight against corruption . 
The public needs to feel confident that laws apply to everyone . 
[ORG EULEX  ] needs to step up its activity and deliver long-promised arrests of high-ranking corrupt public officials , or we run a risk that our rule-of-law reforms will fall flat and leave the public with a perception that the government is little more than a kleptocracy . 
A MULTI-ETHNIC STATE [ORG PRISTINA  ] 00000084 003.2 OF 005 -------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Kosovo  ] has made a strong start in fulfilling its promises under the [MISC Ahtisaari  ] plan to empower [MISC Serb  ] communities . 
[MISC Serb  ] mayors , following municipal elections in November 2009 , now hold office in the new municipalities of [LOC Gracanica  ] , [LOC Klokot  ] , and Ranilug . 
In [LOC Strpce  ] , a pre-existing municipality where the [MISC Serb  ] majority refused to participate in the November 2007 elections , a new legitimate [MISC Serb  ] mayor has taken significant steps to undo the influence of the illegal parallel municipal government that answers to [LOC Belgrade  ] . 
In [LOC Pristina  ] , the central government is devolving more authority to all municipalities , giving local residents a louder voice in shaping their communities' future . 
Most refreshing is that that the [ORG GOK  ] continues to focus on these [MISC Serb  ] communities , providing them with significant new resources in the 2010 budget that will allow them to strengthen the new municipal structures and develop their infrastructure. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In northern [LOC Kosovo  ] the challenges surrounding integration are greater . 
[LOC Belgrade  ] 's legitimacy outstrips [ORG Pristina  ] 's in the northern municipalities of [LOC Leposavic  ] , [PER Zubin Potok  ] , and [MISC Zvecan  ] , but it may not be as unchallenged as [LOC Belgrade  ] would like us to think . 
A municipal preparation team ( MPT ) is now working in the planned new municipality of [LOC North Mitrovica  ] , which will hold a special election later this year to select its inaugural government . 
This MPT is the [ORG GOK  ] 's first step in building on the success of its decentralization efforts in the [LOC South  ] . 
It has adopted a comprehensive approach to the [LOC North  ] that entails an incremental " hearts and minds " campaign to win greater support from northern [MISC Serbs  ] to work with [LOC Kosovo  ] institutions . 
The illegal parallel institutions that control the [LOC North  ] are little more than fronts for organized crime , and the region has become stagnant . 
The [MISC Serbs  ] north of the [LOC Ibar River  ] consistently point to the absence of the rule of law there , and this could prove to be the tool that begins their acceptance of [LOC Pristina  ] -- if the [ORG GOK  ] and [ORG EULEX  ] , together , can make meaningful progress in shutting down the criminal networks that dominate throughout the [LOC North  ] . 
[LOC Pristina  ] can offer hope , but it cannot achieve success on its own . 
The [MISC Europeans  ] need to contribute . 
[ORG EULEX  ] needs to crack down on organized crime , and [LOC Brussels  ] must use the lure of [ORG EU  ] integration to compel [LOC Belgrade  ] to play a helpful role in returning law and order to northern [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
[LOC Pristina  ] cannot return hope to the [LOC North  ] if the international community will not stop [LOC Belgrade  ] from interfering in the region 's development . 
ECONOMIC REFORMS AND PRIVATE SECTOR GROWTH ------------------------------------------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) At the central level [LOC Kosovo  ] has laid a strong foundation for economic reforms . 
In recent months the [ORG Assembly  ] has adopted a debt law that sets rational limits on the amount of debt that the country can incur and should allow [LOC Kosovo  ] to pursue a sovereign credit rating that will permit it to finance its development . 
The [ORG IMF  ] has provided guidance on a [ORG Central Bank  ] law that will both strengthen the institution and open opportunities for more development assistance . 
And , the [ORG GOK  ] is demonstrating an ever improving control of its budgetary process , delivering a comprehensive and reasonable 2010 budget to the [ORG Assembly  ] that prioritizes critical needs . 
Amid these steps , privatization continues . 
The [ORG GOK  ] hosted a pre-bid conference for representatives from three pre-qualified consortia interested in entering into a public-private partnership for the [ORG Pristina Airport  ] which we expect will attract a 100 hundred million [MISC Euro  ] investment , with a contract awarded in April . 
Further cause for optimism is on the near horizon with the upcoming privatization of the [ORG Kosovo Energy Corporation  ] and development of a new 500MW power plant that will put an end to the rolling blackouts that still affect the country . 
When this plant comes online , industry will find a more inviting environment for setting up business. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) These important steps do not mask [LOC Kosovo  ] 's current economic woes that leave many Kosovars without work . 
With an unemployment rate of greater than 40 percent , the economy is suffering . 
There is little industry , the private sector is underdeveloped , and the country 's greatest natural resource -- lignite -- is underutilized due to a dilapidated power infrastructure . 
At present , the government remains the primary [ORG PRISTINA  ] 00000084 004.2 OF 005 engine that drives the economy , a model that is not sustainable . 
Government contracts for road-building projects help to provide temporary employment , but they do not offer the longer term economic stability that the country requires . 
In the coming years , both the government and the international donor community need to redirect their efforts towards projects that will spark greater dynamism and diversity within the private sector . 
The central reforms that have occurred -- and will continue throughout the rest of the year -- provide hope that [LOC Kosovo  ] will soon feature a strong economic framework where private sector growth will necessarily follow . 
[MISC EURO-ATLANTIC  ] INSTITUTIONS -------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Kosovo  ] 's small size presents a challenge for its survival , a challenge that the international community can help surmount with its [MISC Euro-Atlantic  ] institutions . 
The lure of these institutions -- in particular , the [ORG European Union  ] and [ORG NATO  ] -- are tantalizing opportunities that focus the attention of the [ORG GOK  ] . 
With a small population where family and klan ties provide dominant affiliations , [LOC Kosovo  ] is susceptible to corruption that will retard development . 
On the security front , [LOC Kosovo  ] is currently a [ORG NATO  ] protectorate , but those forces are beginning to withdraw , and [LOC Kosovo  ] leaders are wondering whether or not the small ( no more than 2500 active members according to the [ORG Ahtisaari Plan  ] ) and lightly armed [ORG Kosovo Security Force  ] ( [ORG KSF  ] ) can fill the void that [ORG KFOR  ] will leave . 
The antidote for both of these problems is membership within the [ORG European Union  ] and [ORG NATO  ] , and this [MISC Euro-Atlantic  ] orientation is the primary issue that unifies the country 's dueling political forces around a core national vision. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Prime Minister [PER Thaci  ] , daily , expresses his commitment to readying [LOC Kosovo  ] for [ORG EU  ] consideration , and he regards the next [ORG European Union Progress Report  ] on [LOC Kosovo  ] , due in June , with a mix of anxiety and optimism . 
He wants to show the electorate that his leadership is bringing [LOC Kosovo  ] closer to [LOC Brussels  ] , and he wants to be the person who brings [ORG EU  ] visa liberalization to [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
Over the longer term , the country needs [ORG EU  ] membership as an outlet for its young workforce and as a unified market for exports . 
It also needs to define its future relationship with [ORG NATO  ] . 
Every Kosovar desires full membership in an institution second only to the [LOC United States  ] in the hagiography of [LOC Kosovo  ] 's recent history . 
The limitations that the [ORG Ahtisaari Plan  ] places on the [ORG Kosovo Security Force  ] are going to prove contentious over time , especially once [ORG KFOR  ] withdraws completely . 
Without an agreed and viable connection to [ORG NATO  ] , we run the risk that unofficial militias will again develop out of fear that the country is unable to defend itself from aggression . 
COMMENT: -------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Kosovo  ] 's independence has been a success story . 
The worst fears -- large scale population movements and outbreaks of violence -- following February 17 , 2008 , never materialized . 
The political scene , while fractious , works together on the big issues , like decentralization and establishing new institutions . 
The international community and the Kosovars , themselves , can feel good about the positive steps that have occurred over the past two years , but we cannot ignore the challenges that remain . 
With each passing day we need to see the [ORG GOK  ] take more responsibility for securing the country 's future -- more activity on lobbying for recognitions , more temperate political debate , greater respect for the rule of law , and a concerted focus on national interests -- but there remains an ever present role for the international community . 
[ORG Pristina  ] cannot yet extend its authority across its entire territory . 
The [ORG International Steering Group  ] on February 8 gave its blessing to a comprehensive approach that will bolster [ORG Pristina  ] 's presence in the [LOC North  ] , but this approach will also require international support . 
Indeed , each of the steps towards [LOC Kosovo  ] 's eventual membership in the [ORG European Union  ] will require international attention , and we need to make sure that [LOC Brussels  ] gives [ORG Pristina  ] the same consideration that it pays to [LOC Belgrade  ] . 
Above all , the progress that [LOC Kosovo  ] makes in overcoming the challenges it confronts should play the determining role in the country 's qualifications for [ORG European Union  ] and [ORG NATO  ] membership . 
We need to keep the [ORG GOK  ] 's focus squarely on its responsibilities while reminding our [MISC European  ] partners that they too have a role to play .
