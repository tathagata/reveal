ISSA'S MEETING WITH LEADERS OF [MISC LEBANESE  ] COMMUNITY IN [LOC SAO PAULO  ] SENSTIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED - PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. ------- SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) During the visit to [LOC Sao Paulo  ] of [PER CODEL Grassley  ] ( septels ) , [PER Rep. Darrel Issa  ] ( [ORG CA  ] ) held a separate meeting with four leaders of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] 's [MISC Lebanese  ] community . 
They discussed the size and activities of [LOC Brazil  ] 's [MISC Lebanese  ] community as well as the influence of the broader [MISC Arab  ] community on the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] ( [ORG Itamaraty  ] ) in formulating [LOC Brazil  ] 's [LOC Middle East  ] policy . 
End Summary. -------------------------------------- REPRESENTATIVE [PER ISSA  ] MEETS SAO PAULO'S [MISC LEBANESE  ] LEADERS -------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) In a separate meeting from the rest of the [LOC CODEL  ] , [LOC California  ] Representative [PER Darrell Issa  ] met over drinks at the [ORG CG  ] 's residence with four leaders of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] 's [MISC Lebanese  ] community to discuss issues of [LOC Lebanon  ] , the [LOC Middle East  ] , and [MISC Lebanese  ] expatriates . 
In addition to [PER Rep. Issa  ] , [ORG CG  ] , [PER Issa  ] staffer [PER Laurent Crenshaw  ] , and [MISC Poloff  ] , participants included [PER Joseph Sayah  ] , [MISC Lebanese  ] Consul General in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] ; [PER Souheil Yamount  ] , a long-time investment and government relations advisor to the [ORG Hariri Family Group  ] ; [PER Alfredo Cotait Neto  ] , President of the [ORG Brazil-Lebanon Chamber of Commerce  ] ; and [PER Guilherme Mattar  ] , a Director and Secretary-General of the [ORG Brazil-Lebanon Chamber of Commerce  ] . 
[PER Rep. Issa  ] told the group he is of [MISC Lebanese  ] descent and his grandfather lived in [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] before settling in the [LOC United States  ] . 
He has been actively engaged in issues related to [LOC Lebanon  ] and the [LOC Middle East  ] for years , both as a Congressman and before that as a businessman. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) [LOC Brazil  ] 's [MISC Lebanese  ] community is the largest expatriate group of [MISC Lebanese  ] worldwide . 
[ORG CG  ] [PER Sayah  ] confirmed for Representative [PER Issa  ] that after four generations since large-scale immigration began , [LOC Sao Paulo  ] alone is home to some eight million persons of [MISC Lebanese  ] descent . 
[PER Issa  ] wondered aloud if large [MISC Lebanese  ] expatriate communities such as [LOC Sao Paulo  ] 's might be tapped to support the democratic process in [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
[PER Sayah  ] pointed out that currently [LOC Lebanon  ] does not have an absentee voter process , and the country 's parliamentary system would not provide the opportunity to affect presidential elections , which is critical to advancing [LOC Lebanon  ] 's fragile democracy. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Rep. Issa  ] and the group discussed a range of issues facing [LOC Lebanon  ] today , the most pressing being [LOC Iran  ] 's new influence in the country after the power vacuum left by [LOC Syria  ] 's pullout . 
[PER Sayah  ] repeatedly linked [ORG Hezbollah  ] to [LOC Iran  ] , and warned that in upcoming presidential elections in [LOC Lebanon  ] , any candidate who does not specifically denounce [ORG Hezbollah  ] is implicitly supporting [LOC Iran  ] as [ORG Hezbollah  ] 's current benefactor and puppet-master . 
Closer to home , the group candidly acknowledged that [ORG Hezbollah  ] supporters operate in [LOC Parana State  ] and the tri-border region where [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Paraguay  ] , and [LOC Argentina  ] meet. ----------------------------------------- ALLEGED [MISC SYRIAN  ] INFLUENCE WITHIN [ORG ITAMARATY  ] ----------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Sayah  ] and [PER Yarmout  ] gave a somewhat surprising account of the current influence on the [MISC GoB  ] of various elements of the [MISC Arab  ] community in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
When asked why the [MISC GoB  ] had taken some confusing stands counter to the [LOC United States  ] regarding [LOC Middle East  ] policy , both men described the [ORG MFA  ] ( [ORG Itamaraty  ] ) as being greatly influenced by [MISC Syrians  ] in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
They said that for generations , [MISC Syrian-Brazilians  ] have become diplomats , while [MISC Lebanese  ] immigrants have focused on business . 
In the past these trends were not noticed because there was no divergence in opinion or interests among the various elements of the greater [MISC Arab  ] community in [LOC Brazil.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) However , with the [MISC Syrian  ] pullout from [LOC Lebanon  ] and a growing hostility between the two countries fueled by the assassination of [MISC Lebanese  ] former Prime Minister [PER Rafik Hariri  ] , the [MISC GoB  ] finds itself behaving almost schizophrenically , both [PER Sayah  ] and [PER Yarmout  ] asserted . 
The descendents of [MISC Syrians  ] purportedly entrenched in the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] have taken public stands in [LOC SAO PAULO  ] 00000360 002 OF 002 support of [LOC Syria  ] , allegedly at times even without the knowledge or authorization of others in the [LOC Lula  ] administration . 
Further , the [ORG Arab-Brazil Chamber of Commerce  ] has become extremely influential , and the organization tends to oppose [MISC U.S.-led  ] initiatives in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
[ORG EMBASSY BRASILIA  ] COMMENT: [MISC Lebanese  ] [ORG CG  ] [PER Sayah  ] 's comments reflect a fascinating and apparently sincere point of view within [LOC Brazil  ] 's [MISC Lebanese  ] community , and merit further examination and reporting . 
That said , while under the [LOC Lula  ] administration the [ORG MFA  ] 's positions on a number of [LOC Middle Eastern  ] issues have been problematic for the [ORG USG  ] , vexing and even inexplicable , we have no way at present of verifying whether or not they are signs of the existence of a cabal of [MISC Syrian-Brazilian  ] diplomats pursuing their own agenda . 
END COMMENT. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Yamout  ] said that to counter this putative [MISC Syrian-based  ] influence , he recently obtained 10,000 signatures of [MISC Lebanese-Brazilians  ] on a petition demanding that the [LOC Lula  ] administration as a whole , including [ORG Itamaraty  ] , play a more balanced role regarding the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
( NOTE: Both [ORG Yamout  ] and [PER Sayah  ] implied that " [MISC Arab  ] " interests may no longer be the same as " [MISC Lebanese  ] " interests . 
They referred to a subtle change in [ORG Itamaraty  ] policy from being pro-Lebanese to pro-Arab , and thus increasingly incompatible with [MISC Lebanese  ] interests . 
END NOTE . 
) He called the petition a down-payment on grass-roots activism , and said the community will push [ORG Itamaraty  ] to support [LOC U.S.  ] resolutions on [LOC Lebanon  ] , [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Rep. Issa  ] said it will be important to garner international support for a new [ORG U.N.  ] resolution following Resolution 1559 , and for smart investments in [LOC Lebanon  ] , avoiding the corruption that has been seen in past programs. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) [PER Issa  ] wrapped up the evening by declaring that if the [MISC Lebanese  ] expatriate communities of [LOC Brazil  ] and the [LOC Unites States  ] can stand together to press their respective governments to cooperate on promoting democracy and strengthening institutions in [LOC Lebanon  ] , the day may come soon when [LOC Lebanon  ] will finally be free of all foreign influence .

( U ) This cable was coordinated/cleared with [ORG Embassy Brasilia  ] .
