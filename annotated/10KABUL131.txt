( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: The [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Lower House  ] ( [PER Wolesi Jirga  ] - [ORG WJ  ] ) has voted to accept 7 of 17 [MISC Cabinet  ] nominees presented in President [PER Karzai’s  ] second tranche of candidates . 
The [ORG Parliament  ] has not yet decided if it will recess until mid-February , or continue until the new [MISC Cabinet  ] is complete . 
[ORG Presidential Palace Chief  ] of Staff [PER Daudzai  ] told us January 12 that this was the desired outcome -- a political calculation to allow [PER Karzai  ] to back out of campaign promises with traditional powerbrokers . 
The political winners of the vote include [PER Pashtun  ] and [MISC Tajik  ] conservatives and jihadis , as well as a Counternarcotics Minister associated with the drug mafia . 
Meanwhile , neither the two strongest female candidates nor any of the [MISC Uzbek  ] and [LOC Hazara  ] candidates passed muster . 
Many MPs claimed they voted down candidates because they were “weak nobodies , ” connected to warlords , did not offer sufficient significant “donations” to their 2010 Parliamentary elections campaigns , or due to ethnic affiliations . 
End Summary. --------------------------------------------- ----- [ORG WJ  ] Votes on the Second Tranche of [ORG Cabinet Nominees  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) On January 16 , the [ORG WJ  ] voted to approve seven of 17 [MISC Cabinet  ] nominees presented in [PER Karzai’s  ] second tranche of candidates . 
Ten nominees were rejected . 
Some ministerial candidates , like the [ORG MRRD  ] Minister , gained exactly the minimum 113 votes required , while the Counternarcotics Minister received the highest number of votes at 162 . 
Of a total of 249 MPs , 223 were present for the vote . 
The [ORG Literacy Ministry  ] was not included on this latest list because [PER Karzai  ] has not formally created the new ministry and the [ORG WJ  ] has not approved it . 
The President decided to keep the Martyred and Disabled as part of the [LOC Labor  ] and [ORG Social Affairs Ministry  ] . 
Four more positions that require confirmation but have not yet been submitted are the heads of the intelligence service , the [ORG Central Bank  ] , and the [ORG Red Crescent Society  ] , as well as the [PER Attorney General  ] . 
These positions are traditionally submitted after the completion of the ministerial approval process. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Those candidates approved in the second tranche included the Foreign Affairs Minister , Justice , [LOC Hajj  ] and [ORG Religious Affairs  ] , [ORG Economy  ] , [ORG Rural Rehabilitation and Development  ] ( [ORG MRRD  ] ) , and the [LOC Labor  ] , [ORG Social Affairs  ] and Martyred Minister . 
Vote tallies and short biographic notes are in paras 10 and 11 . 
The [ORG Parliament  ] has not yet decided if it will recess until mid-February , or continue until the Cabinet is complete . 
They will meet again on January 17 and will likely decide at that point. ---------------------------------------- Palace: “We Wanted Them To Be Rejected” ---------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG Presidential Palace Chief  ] of Staff [PER Omer Daudzai  ] told D/Ambassador Ricciardone January 12 that the palace purposefully introduced weak candidates associated with some of the traditional powerbrokers so that the [ORG Parliament  ] would reject them . 
[PER Daudzai  ] only expected about five nominees to pass . 
He claimed this approach allowed [PER Karzai  ] to back out of campaign promises to some of these former warlords , and instead , nominate more candidates that were loyal to [PER Karzai  ] . 
[PER Daudzai  ] claimed [PER Karzai  ] had asked him to refrain from campaigning for ministers , and that [PER Karzai  ] was pleased that the tone of the powerbrokers in meetings to discuss cabinet nominations had already “improved” since the first cabinet list , as the warlords were more willing to accept [PER Karzai’s  ] suggested cabinet nominations . 
[PER Daudzai  ] believed the third list would be “stronger.” ---------------------------- Political Winners and Losers ---------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The political winners of the vote include [PER Pashtun  ] and [MISC Tajik  ] conservatives , as well as a Counternarcotics Minister associated with the drug mafia . 
The winners also included one [MISC Afghan  ] Millat/former King [PER Zahir Shah  ] candidate ( Foreign Affairs ) , two candidates associated with former warlord and fundamentalist [PER Ustad  ] [PER Rasoul Sayyaf  ] ( [LOC Hajj  ] and Justice ) , one [ORG Hezb-e-Islami Afghanistan  ] candidate ( [ORG Economy  ] ) , and three candidates either associated with former warlords [PER Marshal Fahim  ] or Professor Rabbani’s [ORG Jamiat  ] party ( [ORG MRRD  ] , [LOC Labor  ] and [ORG Social Affairs  ] , and Counternarcotics . 
) Meanwhile , the two strongest female candidates were not approved , nor were the three candidates associated with [MISC Dostum  ] and the [MISC Uzbek  ] [ORG Junbesh KABUL  ] 00000131 002 OF 005 party ( Health , Transport , and Communications . 
) The three [LOC Hazara  ] candidates ( [LOC Commerce  ] , Public Works , and [ORG Urban Development  ] ) and the one pro-Iran candidate ( Higher Education ) also failed. -------------------------------- Vote Motivations Remain Numerous -------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC WJ’s  ] display of strength both on January 2 and January 16 no doubt reflected a variety of motives , including candidates’ qualifications , blow-back from executive dominance , political and financial gain , as well as a desire to avoid warlord candidates and certain ethnicities ( reftel A ) . 
Several MPs told us this cabinet list was full of “weak nobodies” lacking the political stature to be effective ministers. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG WJ  ] also sought to assert itself after years of executive dominance , in particular in the first round of cabinet voting . 
At least three cabinet ministers had received [ORG WJ  ] votes of no confidence in the past five years , yet [PER Karzai  ] kept them in office as acting ministers , in some cases for several years . 
Also , when the [ORG WJ  ] overrode Karzai’s veto of the [ORG Media Law  ] , which required the Executive to obtain the [MISC WJ’s  ] approval of the head of the main government-supported media outlet [ORG RTA  ] , the Executive sent the case to the [ORG Supreme Court  ] and quietly had [MISC Karzai’s  ] version approved during the busy presidential elections period. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Understandably , MPs wanted to maximize their leverage for both political and financial gain . 
The cabinet approval process is one of the rare occasions when the [ORG WJ  ] is in a position of power . 
MPs tell us this is the time when MPs can obtain significant “donations” to their 2010 Parliamentary elections campaigns . 
[PER Al-Haj Moeen Marastyal  ] ( [PER Pashtun  ] , [LOC Kunduz  ] ) told us January 14 that MPs prefer second and third lists of cabinet nominees so they can receive second and third envelopes of cash . 
He claimed the Counternarcotics Minister was distributing to MPs record amounts , from 8,000 - 15,000 USD per MP. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Some MPs have voted against warlord candidates , and opposed or supported others depending on ethnic affiliations . 
Notably , unlike in the first round of cabinet voting , some traditional powerbrokers are now attempting to disassociate themselves from the candidates . 
However , influential former warlord [ORG Sayyaf’s Political Advisor  ] admitted to us January 12 that most of these candidates are in fact associated with the powerbrokers , and indeed [PER Rabbani  ] had his candidates , as did [PER Sayyaf  ] . 
They did not want to admit it for fear that this would cause their candidates to fail the approval process. --------------------------- Short Bios And Vote Tallies --------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 .

He is also currently one of [ORG Karzai’s Tribal Advisors  ] . 
His exposure to the [LOC West  ] -- he lived in the [LOC U.S.  ] for a few years and still has family in [LOC California  ] -- has made him a notable moderate on economic and social issues in a party whose membership gravitates to conservative [MISC Islamic  ] beliefs . 
He was [PER Gulbuddin Hekmatyar’s  ] financial officer for much of the 1980s . 
He has modernized the party and renounced the use of violence , and broke with [PER Hekmatyar  ] in the late 1990s .
