REASON: 1.4 ( e ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: [LOC Libya  ] 's banking reform program continues to make progress . 
Buoyed by the windfall that accompanied the February 13 sale of a share in state-run [ORG Wahda Bank  ] to [LOC Jordan  ] 's [ORG Arab Bank  ] , the [ORG Central Bank  ] is pressing forward with its own restructuring and training programs . 
There may be opportunities for increased private sector cooperation with [LOC U.S.  ] banks and opportunities for the USG to help train [LOC Libya  ] 's next generation of bankers . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Based on the assessment of [ORG Central Bank  ] Governor [PER Farhat Bengadara  ] and the project director of the firm serving as his strategic advisor ( [PER McKinsey  ] and [ORG Company  ] ) , [LOC Libya  ] 's bank reform is making solid progress . 
[ORG CDA  ] met with [PER Bengadara  ] on March 11 to discuss the [ORG Central Bank of Libya  ] 's ( [ORG CBL  ] ) ongoing program of banking reform , and to solicit updates on its training programs and openness to [LOC U.S.  ] assistance . 
Econoff met separately with the team leader for [PER McKinsey  ] and [ORG Company  ] , a [LOC U.S.  ] firm providing strategic guidance to the entire [ORG CBL  ] reform program . 
[ORG BANK PRIVATIZATIONS PROCEEDING APACE  ] .. . 
3 . 
( C ) The [ORG CBL  ] remains satisfied with its ongoing program of privatizations and mergers for [LOC Libya  ] 's state-run commercial banks . 
Jordan-based [ORG Arab Bank  ] 's successful $310 million bid for a 19 percent share of [ORG Wahda Bank  ] ( reftel ) has bolstered the [ORG GOL  ] 's commitment to banking reform . 
The winning bid came in at almost ten times the estimated book value for [ORG Wahda Bank  ] . 
( [PER Note: Book  ] value was computed by [LOC U.S.  ] accounting firm [ORG KPMG  ] , which is working with the [ORG CBL  ] on its reform program . 
[ORG Arab Bank  ] 's branches in [LOC Libya  ] were nationalized in 1970 , fueling some speculation that its high bid was driven in part by a desire to " reclaim " its position in [LOC Libya  ] . 
End Note ) . 
The high sale price has been interpreted in some [ORG GOL  ] quarters as an expression of increased confidence in [LOC Libya  ] by the international financial community . 
The successful three-stage bidding process ( initial application , technical bid , financial bid ) by which the sale was conducted has validated the transparent approach advocated by the [ORG CBL.  ] ...DESPITE SOME HARDBALL , ITALIAN-STYLE <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In the weeks leading up to the announcement of [ORG Arab Bank  ] 's winning bid , two of five foreign banks interested in bidding pulled out . 
The most publicized decision was that of [MISC France-based  ] [ORG Societe Generale  ] , which cited " technical reasons " widely assumed ( and privately confirmed to Econoff by a local [PER McKinsey  ] representative ) to be linked to the bank 's exposure to the sub-prime mortgage crunch and recent $10 billion losses incurred by a rogue trader . 
The less public withdrawal was by [MISC Italy-based  ] [PER Intessa  ] , which sought to play hardball with the [ORG CBL  ] by demanding ten changes in the way the transaction would be implemented . 
The [ORG CBL  ] rejected [PER Intessa  ] 's overture over concerns that the offer upset an otherwise level playing field for other bidders . 
Encouraged by [PER McKinsey  ] , the [ORG CBL  ] chose to adhere to its three-tier bid process and international standards for transparency . 
In the end , despite offering one of the higher bids , [PER Intessa  ] was outstripped by [ORG Arab Bank  ] 's financial offer . 
[ORG CENTRAL BANK INTERNAL REFORMS ONGOING  ] 5 . 
( C ) The [ORG CBL  ] is currently upgrading its monetary policy functions to better manage monetary policy functions . 
It is also seeking to develop more robust research and banking supervision departments , with the latter firmly fixed on making a transition to risk assessment , vice direct involvement in the transactions of its affiliated state-run banks . 
Drawing on foreign expertise from [PER McKinsey  ] , Oracle , [ORG KPMB  ] and others , the [ORG CBL  ] is also in the process of implementing upgrades to the structure of the entire banking system , to include new IT systems , a standardized loan application packet and a national payment system . 
[ORG CBL  ] Governor [PER Bengadara  ] anticipates the process will take an additional three years to complete . 
The [ORG CBL  ] is also in the process of creating a credit bureau , a project being implemented by [LOC U.S.  ] firm [ORG Dunn and Bradstreet  ] , with overall supervision by [PER McKinsey  ] . 
6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Bengadara  ] bemoaned the fact that the [ORG CBL  ] remains engaged in a number of activities more appropriately handled by the [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] , including the national budget and the privatization of [MISC Libyan  ] state-run banks . 
The [ORG CBL  ] and MinFin are both currently working with the [ORG IMF  ] on a restructuring program , [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000230 002 OF 002 and the [ORG CBL  ] anticipates agreeing on a separate reform program with the [ORG World Bank  ] on the margins of the upcoming [ORG IMF/World Bank  ] Spring meetings in [LOC Washington  ] . 
A FOCUS ON TRAINING 7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG CBL  ] has established the [MISC Tripoli-based  ] " Banking and [ORG Financial Studies Center  ] " in accordance with a October 2006 GPC decree . 
It currently offers short-term , general courses in computer skills and banking operations , and medium-term [MISC English  ] language training . 
The [ORG CBL  ] also sends students to the [LOC U.K.  ] for [MISC English  ] language training , and has 45 students there pursuing master 's degrees in banking . 
( [PER Note:  ] At [PER Bengadara  ] 's request , Post is following-up with [ORG CBL  ] staff to provide information on [LOC U.S.  ] universities that offer MBAs and [ORG MA  ] 's in commercial and central banking . 
End Note ) . 
8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As part of the training effort , the [PER McKinsey  ] team in [LOC Tripoli  ] is focusing on requalifying the [ORG CBL  ] 's human resources staff , emphasizing recruitment and performance management skills training . 
Serious deficiencies in accounting standards persist throughout the banking system ; the situation has not shown tangible signs of improvement . 
The dearth of reliable information on [MISC Libyan  ] banks and companies continues to hinder economic growth , as [MISC Libyan  ] savings continue to be spent abroad more than at home , and foreign companies are dissuaded from entering an opaque market . 
ASSESSMENT TIME 9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Standard & Poor  ] 's and [ORG Moody 's  ] , two of the top evaluators of credit risk , are expected to be invited to conduct an assessment of [LOC Libya  ] sometime during the next six months . 
Excluding [ORG WB  ] and [ORG IMF  ] reports , this type of assessment has not been done previously in [LOC Libya  ] . 
The [ORG GOL  ] intends that the assessment signal to the international business community that [LOC Libya  ] 's banks are open for business , and to demonstrate interest in tapping the international bond market in a serious way . 
10 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Bengadara  ] impressed us as a credible , savvy interlocutor . 
Concerns about [MISC English  ] language ability and technical skills below the [ORG CBL  ] 's uppermost echelons remain ; however , he clearly signaled a willingness in principle to cooperate with the [LOC USG  ] on training , to include counter-terrorism finance . 
Banking reform is moving ahead ; we likely have a window of 18 to 24 months in which to contribute on the training and reform front . 
Post will work with [PER Bengadara  ] and his senior staff to gain support for critical training programs , particularly in [LOC CT  ] finance .
