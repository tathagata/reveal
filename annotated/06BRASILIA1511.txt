( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] The [MISC Colombian  ] government has called on [LOC Brazil  ] to reverse a July 14 decision to grant asylum to wanted [ORG FARC  ] terrorist [PER Francisco Antonio Cadena  ] . 
Some media in [LOC Brazil  ] greeted the decision with speculation that the judicial asylum process was subverted by President [PER Lula da Silva  ] and elements of his [ORG Workers Party  ] , who maintained close ties with [ORG FARC  ] leader [PER Cadena  ] , who lived in [LOC Brazil  ] before his arrest last year and who has a minor child with his [MISC Brazilian  ] wife . 
The [MISC Colombian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Brasilia  ] will meet July 28 with the head of the [MISC Brazilian  ] refugee committee which granted the asylum request , apparently on the strength of a written statement by [PER Cadena  ] promising to sever all ties with the [MISC Colombian  ] terrorist group , the [ORG FARC  ] . 
The granting of asylum to a known terrorist flies in the face of [MISC Brazilian  ] claims to oppose international terrorism . 
Particularly troubling are the allegations of the Presidency subverting the judicial process and pressuring the refugee committee to take a decision contrary to its own guidelines , allegations we find credible . 
We , like the [MISC Colombians  ] , will try to discover the official rationale for the decision and how the [ORG GOB  ] reconciles it with its public opposition to international terrorism . 
We would also appreciate instructions on other actions , if any , we should be taking . 
End Summary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In a decision taken and kept in secret , the [ORG Brazilian National Committee  ] on [ORG Refuges  ] ( [ORG CONARE  ] ) July 14 granted political refugee status to [PER Francisco Antonio Cadena Collazos  ] ( known in [LOC Brazil  ] as [PER Olivera Medina  ] ) , the so-called Ambassador to [LOC Brazil  ] of the [ORG FARC  ] ( [ORG Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia  ] ) , who was arrested in [LOC Brazil  ] in August 2005 at the request of [ORG Interpol  ] , based on a [MISC Colombian  ] arrest warrant which included charges of murder for terrorist purposes , kidnapping , extortion and terrorism . 
The decision will make it impossible for [PER Cadena  ] to be extradited to [LOC Colombia  ] as the [MISC Colombian  ] government requested on August 24 , 2005 ( reftel ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In a statement issued July 19 in [LOC Bogota  ] , the [MISC Colombian  ] government requested the [MISC Brazilian  ] government to reconsider the decision to grant asylum to [PER Cadena  ] and reiterated its previous request for his extradition . 
The Political Counselor of the [MISC Colombian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Brasilia  ] , [PER Juan Manuel Gonzalez Ayerbe  ] , pointed out to poloff July 27 that [ORG CONARE  ] guidelines preclude the granting of asylum to persons who have committed war crimes or crimes against peace or humanity , heinous crimes or acts of terrorism or drug trafficking . 
[PER Gonzalez  ] added that , aside from providing an official notification of the decision through its [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Bogota  ] , the [ORG GOB  ] had made no comment on the case to the [MISC Colombians  ] and had not provided an official explanation of the decision . 
[PER Gonzalez  ] said that one of his contacts at the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] had told him unofficially that [PER Cadena  ] had signed a statement saying he would cut all ties with the [ORG FARC  ] , and that [ORG CONARE  ] had made its decision on that basis. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Gonzalez  ] said the [LOC Colombia  ] [ORG Embassy  ] would meet July 28 with [PER Luis Paulo Barreto  ] , the General Secretary of the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] , who serves as the chair of [ORG CONARE  ] , to seek a full explanation and to reiterate its request that asylum be revoked and extradition proceed . 
[ORG CONARE  ] 's other members include the Ministries of [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] ( [ORG Vice-Chair  ] ) , Labor , Health , Education , the [ORG Federal Police  ] , [ORG UNHCR  ] and [ORG NGO  ] 's from [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] and [LOC Sao Paulo  ] . 
The press spokesman of the [ORG CONARE  ] told the [ORG Embassy  ] July 27 that all [ORG CONARE  ] documents are confidential ; there are no public records or press releases concerning decisions , neither are decisions published in the official government gazette . 
The rationale behind the secrecy is that persons requesting refugee status are assumed to be in danger , so their names cannot be released to the public. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) An article in the July 27 edition of the daily newspaper [ORG Correio Brasiliense  ] repeated the claim made to the [MISC Colombian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] that the decision by [ORG CONARE  ] was taken on account of [PER Cadena  ] 's commitment to cease terrorist activities and quotes him as saying he will devote all his efforts from now on to taking care of his [MISC Brazilian  ] family . 
The article notes that the [ORG Justice Ministry  ] had denied there had been political pressure concerning the decision and gave assurances that the decision was taken for technical reasons . 
That claim is at variance with what [ORG Correio  ] reported in April ( reftel ) . <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) At that time , the daily reported that [ORG CONARE  ] members were complaining that the Office of the Presidency had usurped the role of [ORG CONARE  ] in assessing [PER Cadena  ] 's asylum request , calling the action a dangerous precedent that politicized an issue that should be handled on its legal and technical merits . 
[ORG CONARE  ] members accused [ORG Presidential International Affairs Advisor Marcos Aurelio Garcia  ] of being behind the transfer of authority over the extradition request from the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] to the Office of the Presidency ( The [MISC Colombian  ] Ambassador echoed that view to the Charge , adding that [PER Garcia  ] was known to have " sympathy " for the [ORG FARC  ] ) . 
An advisor to [PER Garcia  ] rejected the charge , saying [PER Garcia  ] was not involved in the issue. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Counselor [PER Gonzalez  ] raised [PER Garcia  ] 's name during our July 27 meeting as a key player in the decision-making process . 
He added that , during the many years [PER Cadena  ] spent in [LOC Brazil  ] prior to his arrest last year , he had cultivated close ties with President [PER Lula  ] 's [ORG Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PT  ] ) and had met with leaders of the [ORG PT  ] in a house just outside of [LOC Brasilia  ] ( called the [ORG Red Heart Mansion  ] ) owned by a [ORG PT  ] member of [ORG Congress  ] . 
He also echoed press and other public accounts that [ORG PT  ] leaders had met with [PER Cadena  ] in prison . 
While pointing out that claims of [ORG FARC  ] donations to [ORG PT  ] campaigns had never been proven , he insisted there was ample proof of [PER Cadena  ] 's ties with [ORG PT  ] leaders. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Comment: The decision by the [MISC Brazilian  ] committee is audacious but not necessarily surprising , as is the near silence surrounding it . 
Aside from a few articles in the [MISC Brazilian  ] press , there has been little notice of the decision and no statements from [MISC Brazilian  ] leftists ( including those who have run a web site in support of his asylum claim ) or the [ORG FARC  ] itself . 
Of course , the [ORG GOB  ] 's silence on the issue is not surprising . 
Granting refugee status to a man accused of terrorism against a friendly , democratically elected government of a neighboring country is hardly the thing President [PER Lula  ] or his associates would be eager to defend publicly , especially since it would inevitably result during this election period in a new airing of the claims of [ORG FARC  ] support for [ORG PT  ] 2002 campaigns , possibly including [PER Lula  ] 's . 
[ORG Embassy  ] believes that high level political pressure resulted in this decision. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Action Request: We , like the [MISC Colombians  ] , will be trying to find out what the official rationale for the asylum decision was and how that can be reconciled with the [ORG GOB  ] 's supposed opposition to international terrorism . 
We would also appreciate instructions from [LOC Washington  ] regarding other actions we should be taking .
