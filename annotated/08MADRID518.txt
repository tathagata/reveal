( C ) WHA Assistant Secretary [PER Tom Shannon  ] visited Madrid April 30-May 1 , 2008 . 
He met with Secretary General of the [ORG Presidency Bernardino Leon  ] and former President [PER Jose Maria Aznar  ] . 
He also attended a lunch in his honor hosted by Charge d' [PER Affaires Hugo Llorens  ] with [MISC Spanish  ] private sector , media , and government experts on [LOC Latin America  ] and gave interviews to daily [ORG El Pais  ] and with [ORG Antena  ] 3 TV . 
[PER Leon  ] stressed the need for the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Spain  ] to work together in [LOC Latin America  ] . 
[PER Aznar  ] emphasized the importance of [LOC Colombia  ] and [LOC Mexico  ] and urged the [LOC U.S.  ] to maintain strong support for both . 
Both [PER Leon  ] and [PER Aznar  ] expressed concerns about [LOC Argentina  ] . 
[PER Leon Stresses Desire  ] to Work with [LOC U.S.  ] in [LOC Latin America  ] --------------------------------------------- ---------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER A/S Shannon  ] and [PER CDA Llorens  ] met April 30 with newly installed Secretary General of the [ORG Presidency  ] ( and former [ORG MFA  ] number two ) [PER Bernardino Leon  ] . 
[PER A/S Shannon  ] told [PER Leon  ] the [LOC U.S.  ] wanted to maintain continuity in policy towards [LOC Latin America  ] through the next Administration . 
He emphasized the importance of strategic partners such as [LOC Spain  ] , and thanked [PER Leon  ] for the effort he and [ORG MFA  ] Secretary of State [PER Trinidad Jimenez  ] had made to work with the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Leon  ] said President [PER Zapatero  ] would need to make [LOC Latin America  ] a foreign policy priority and work it intensively . 
He suggested this was an area where [LOC Spain  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] should coordinate closely and at the most senior levels . 
He said the strategic effort should be to work closely with countries such as [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Chile  ] , [LOC Colombia  ] , and [LOC Mexico  ] . 
Looking ahead to the new [PER Zapatero  ] administration , [PER Leon  ] predicted the opposition [ORG Popular Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) might be more conciliatory than in the past . 
He said [PER Zapatero  ] would put more emphasis on foreign policy , and he stressed that good relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] would be a priority . 
[PER Leon  ] mentioned he had met recently with foreign policy advisors to all three [LOC U.S.  ] Presidential candidates . 
He suggested both governments should begin thinking about a meeting between Presidents [PER Bush  ] and [PER Zapatero  ] in September at the [ORG UNGA  ] . 
[PER Leon  ] noted that this meeting with [PER A/S Shannon  ] was the first he had held with anyone outside the [MISC Spanish  ] Government since assuming his new post. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER A/S Shannon  ] explained the [LOC U.S.  ] was looking forward to two key events: the [ORG OAS General Assembly  ] ( [ORG OASGA  ] ) in [LOC Medellin  ] in June 2008 where the Deputy Secretary would lead the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation and the [ORG Summit  ] of the [ORG Americas  ] in [LOC Trinidad and Tobago  ] in April 2009 . 
He noted [LOC Mexico  ] and others were working to reduce tensions between [LOC Colombia  ] and [LOC Ecuador  ] in advance of the [ORG OASGA  ] as well as to avoid disruptions by [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Chavez  ] . 
[PER A/S Shannon  ] said the [ORG Summit  ] of the [ORG Americas  ] would be the new [LOC U.S.  ] President 's first multilateral event with [LOC Latin America  ] , and a major goal would be to put the summit process back on a positive track after the Mar de [LOC Plata  ] experience . 
He indicated the Administration would continue to push its free trade agenda. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Leon  ] said [LOC Argentina  ] was very worrisome . 
[MISC Spanish  ] companies in [LOC Argentina  ] were concerned by the populist tone of the government , political polarization , and the level of corruption . 
There were " complicated " people and movements around the presidency . 
He suggested some lived by the old adage that " a politician who is poor is a poor politician . 
" He said there was much work for [LOC Spain  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] to do with respect to [LOC Argentina  ] and complemented President [PER Bush  ] for setting a positive tone with President [PER Cristina Fernandez Kirchner  ] . 
[PER A/S Shannon  ] mentioned that he had recently visited [LOC Argentina  ] and that in June a USG team would visit [LOC Buenos Aires  ] to reinitiate the lapsed high-level dialogue . 
The goal was to define the bilateral relationship by shared interests rather than by differences . 
He predicted strife between various [MISC Argentine  ] sectors was just beginning ; the agricultural strike was merely the first round . 
He said the [MISC Peronist  ] tendency once a crisis was past was to look for wealth and figure out how to spend it . 
Ironically , the more complicated internal situation might lead the government to seek to mend fences internationally . 
He said the costs of too close association with [PER Chavez  ] were now clear to the [ORG GOA  ] , as evidenced by [PER Chavez  ] 's recent decision to nationalize the [MISC Argentine  ] firm [ORG SIDOR.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Leon  ] said [LOC Spain  ] hoped to use the [LOC EU-Latin America  ] and the [LOC Caribbean  ] summit in [LOC Lima  ] in May to seek a trade pact where those [MISC Latin American  ] countries who wanted in could be in and those who wanted out could stay out . 
The goal was to keep a country like [LOC Bolivia  ] or [LOC Ecuador  ] from dragging down the others . 
[PER A/S Shannon  ] noted this might help with the [ORG U.S. Congress  ] on the free trade issue. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Leon  ] said a post-Uribe [LOC Colombia  ] raised concerns , although there were sensible people on the left ( e.g. , [ORG Polo Democratico  ] leader [ORG Gaviria  ] ) . 
He noted that post-Uribe , especially if the situation in [LOC Peru  ] deteriorated , the [LOC Andean  ] region would be even more problematic . 
He said [LOC Peru  ] was a very key country. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Leon  ] said he was worried about [LOC Bolivia  ] and the threat to [MISC Spanish  ] business interests there . 
He predicted [PER Morales  ] would lose the May 4 referendum . 
[PER A/S Shannon  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] was looking past May 4 and talking to the group of friends ( [LOC Argentina  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] , and [LOC Colombia  ] ) as well as the [LOC Vatican  ] . 
He predicted the referendum results would provide greater legitimacy to the state governors and blunt the [ORG GOB  ] 's criticism of the opposition and the [LOC U.S  ] . 
( he noted wryly that the [ORG GOB  ] had blasted the [LOC U.S.  ] Ambassador at the same time the [MISC Bolivian  ] FM was in the [LOC U.S.  ] seeking USG assistance ) . 
[PER A/S Shannon  ] said the governors needed to exercise caution and not be overly aggressive . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] message was that we supported dialogue but not secession . 
He doubted secession would come to pass . 
He said the [LOC U.S.  ] was also talking to the armed forces and urging them to work within the constitution . 
He noted the military understood the risk to it as an institution . 
[PER Leon  ] asked if the [ORG GOB  ] was arming civilians . 
[PER A/S Shannon  ] replied that some such activity was possible , but he doubted it was on a large scale . 
He said some [PER Morales  ] advisors might be pushing confrontation in order to paint the provinces as rebellious , but the [LOC U.S.  ] message was that the provinces had to work within the confines of the law . 
He noted the [MISC Bolivian  ] FM was in [LOC Washington  ] recently and tried without success to interest the [ORG OAS Permanent Council  ] in a resolution condemning the provinces . 
[PER Leon  ] said [LOC Spain  ] 's message was complimentary: territorial integrity but respect for the provinces as political units. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER A/S Shannon  ] noted [LOC New Mexico  ] Governor [PER Richardson  ] had recently visited [LOC Caracas  ] in connection with the three [MISC Americans  ] in the hands of the [ORG FARC  ] . 
[PER Chavez  ] told him the [LOC U.S.  ] should help [PER Morales  ] and work with the governors to make sure [PER Morales  ] was not backed into a corner . 
This was unusual given [LOC Venezuela  ] had in the past urged on [PER Morales  ] . 
It appeared [PER Chavez  ] might be genuinely worried about the turn matters could take in [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
[PER Leon  ] said he too was nervous about the situation . 
He noted [LOC Spain  ] would regard a deployment of troops or police to the oil installations as a very bad sign. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Leon  ] said it was essential that the next [MISC Iberoamerican  ] summit ( [LOC El Salvador  ] in November 2008 ) move beyond the famous incident in [LOC Chile  ] between King [PER Juan Carlos  ] and [PER Chavez  ] . 
He mentioned [PER Zapatero  ] would see [PER Chavez  ] in [LOC Lima  ] to try and set the stage for a more positive summit . 
Regardless , there were no guarantees someone would not seek confrontation in [LOC El Salvador  ] . 
[ORG Aznar Looks to Colombia  ] and [LOC Mexico  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER A/S Shannon  ] and [ORG CDA  ] Llorens also met April 30 with former President [PER Jose Maria Aznar  ] . 
[PER Aznar  ] said he was worried about [LOC Latin America  ] . 
He described what he called an anti-NAFTA , anti-Colombia [ORG FTA  ] theme in the [LOC U.S.  ] Presidential primaries . 
At the same time , he criticized an excessive emphasis on free trade and open markets in dealing with [LOC Latin America  ] . 
Both were fundamental , but the [LOC U.S.  ] also needed to focus on how it could isolate [PER Chavez  ] and also should keep a wary eye on [MISC Chinese  ] and [MISC Muslim  ] influence in [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
He argued the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [ORG EU  ] needed to articulate a policy more understandable to the common people and more comprehensive . 
[PER A/S Shannon  ] agreed on the need to support civil society and [ORG NGOs  ] in [LOC Latin America  ] . 
He said many people in the [LOC U.S.  ] had a view of [LOC Latin America  ] frozen in the 1990s , but the region was changing rapidly . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Spain  ] should be looking for catalytic ways of supporting democratic governance , civil society , and economic development . 
He noted that in the past the [LOC U.S.  ] had sometimes ignored [LOC Latin America  ] until a crisis arose ; in contrast , President [PER Bush  ] had a record of solid engagement in the region. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [ORG Aznar  ] mentioned he had spoken with [MISC Mexican  ] President [PER Calderon  ] before the [LOC New Orleans  ] summit and [PER Calderon  ] had expressed concern about waning [ORG Congressional  ] support for [ORG NAFTA  ] and the [LOC Merida  ] initiative . 
[ORG Aznar  ] said failure of the [LOC Colombia  ] [ORG FTA  ] would be catastrophic . 
He said [PER Uribe  ] was the best friend the [LOC U.S.  ] had in [LOC Latin America  ] , and the end of the [ORG FARC  ] was in sight . 
He noted both [PER Chavez  ] and [MISC Ecuadorian  ] President [PER Correa  ] were implicated by information obtained as a result of the [ORG GOC  ] operation against [PER Raul Reyes  ] . 
It was more important now than ever for the [LOC U.S.  ] to support [LOC Colombia  ] . 
[ORG Aznar  ] said [LOC Colombia  ] and [LOC Mexico  ] were the key countries in the region . 
[ORG Aznar  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Spain  ] should be working together to get [LOC Mexico  ] to be more active regionally . 
Although [MISC Brazilian  ] regional engagement was positive , it needed to be complemented by more [MISC Mexican  ] engagement . 
He urged the [LOC U.S.  ] to continue supporting both [LOC Colombia  ] and [LOC Mexico  ] , saying that if [PER Calderon  ] and [PER Uribe  ] were successful , it would shift the entire region in a positive direction . 
[PER A/S Shannon  ] briefed [ORG Aznar  ] on the Administration 's continuing efforts to win approval for the [ORG FTA  ] with [LOC Colombia  ] as well as the [LOC Merida  ] initiative , which represented a very constructive [LOC U.S.  ] response to the concerns of [LOC Mexico  ] and [LOC Central America  ] regarding security and law enforcement . 
He also briefed [ORG Aznar  ] on the [LOC New Orleans  ] meetings and the emphasis Presidents [PER Bush  ] and [PER Calderon  ] and [PER PM Harper  ] put on a common vision for trade , security , and border management. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Despite his worries for the region , [ORG Aznar  ] noted many countries were doing well . 
He cited [LOC Chile  ] , [LOC Panama  ] , and [LOC Peru  ] . 
[ORG Aznar  ] said the electoral results in [LOC Paraguay  ] were a good step ; the ideological leanings of the new government would not make much of a difference . 
[ORG Aznar  ] said [LOC Brazil  ] appeared to have put populism firmly behind it . 
He described [PER Lula  ] as a mainstream figure , albeit one who presented a friendlier face to the disadvantaged . 
He urged that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Spain  ] support good governance regardless of whether it came from the left or the right. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [ORG Aznar  ] said the situation in [LOC Argentina  ] was very complicated . 
They appeared to be reverting to the vicious cycles of [LOC Peronism  ] in which sectors with money were shaken down by the government . 
One interesting sign was the emergence of a more critical middle class , but [PER Cristina Fernandez Kirchner  ] was a disappointment . 
He had once hoped she would conduct a more sophisticated foreign policy , but she appeared now to be a puppet of her husband . 
[PER A/S Shannon  ] said [LOC Argentina  ] was underperforming in terms of attracting foreign investment and was conducting an erroneous foreign policy . 
The last six years had seen economic improvement , but the [MISC Peronists  ] again seemed to be looking for the money . 
[ORG Aznar  ] agreed the growth had been notable , sustained in large part by favorable international commodity prices , but he said the recovery remained fragile . 
The [ORG GOA  ] lacked credibility with the international business community , and the [MISC Argentine  ] banking sector was weak . 
[PER A/S Shannon  ] hoped [LOC Argentina  ] had learned a lesson from [LOC Venezuela  ] 's nationalization of the steel company [ORG SIDOR  ] . 
Playing with [PER Chavez  ] was a good way to get burned . 
Nevertheless , he noted the [ORG GOA  ] , for all its faults , was not in the same camp as [PER Chavez  ] . 
[PER A/S Shannon  ] and [ORG Aznar  ] agreed it was important for the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Spain  ] to remain actively engaged with the [ORG GOA  ] and maintain a dialogue with it . 
[PER A/S Shannon  ] noted his recent visit there and the resumption of a regular , formal dialogue between the [ORG USG  ] and [ORG GOA  ] . 
[ORG Aznar  ] applauded the initiative. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [ORG Aznar  ] praised President [PER Bush  ] 's strong stance in support of a democratic transition in [LOC Cuba  ] and his most recent speech on the subject . 
He said we needed to monitor carefully the steps [PER Raul Castro  ] was taking , some of which were in the right direction . 
Nevertheless , both the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [ORG EU  ] needed to stay on the record as promoting democratic transition and openly supporting civil society and the dissidents . 
[PER A/S Shannon  ] noted the [ORG GOC  ] was attempting to isolate the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Aznar  ] said anything the [LOC U.S.  ] , [ORG EU  ] , and [LOC Spain  ] could do to publicize the truth on [LOC Cuba  ] would help . 
He cited the recent crackdown on the [ORG Damas de Blanco  ] , noting the news in [LOC Cuba  ] was more than just cell phones and computers . 
The public needed to know what was really happening . 
He said that was the way to keep the pressure on [PER Raul Castro  ] , whom he said should not be allowed to consolidate power . 
[PER Fidel  ] would continue to be an immobilizing element as long as he lived , but when he died , it might set in motion events [PER Raul  ] could not control . 
Experts' Lunch -------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Lunch at the [ORG CDA  ] 's residence brought together a variety of [LOC Latin America  ] experts: [MISC Roman Escolano  ] of [ORG BBVA  ] ; [PER Jaime Malet  ] of the [LOC Amcham  ] ; [PER Alberto Carnero  ] of [ORG FAES  ] ; [PER Asis Martin  ] de Cabiedes of [ORG Europa Press  ] , [PER Juan Luis Cebrian  ] of [ORG Grupo Prisa  ] , and [PER Eduardo San Martin  ] of [ORG ABC  ] ; and [PER Javier Sandomingo  ] , [ORG MFA  ] Director General for [LOC Iberoamerica  ] . 
The discussion was off the record and vigorous . 
Topics included [LOC Cuba  ] , [LOC Venezuela  ] , [LOC Mexico  ] , the [LOC Colombia  ] [ORG FTA  ] , and [LOC Argentina  ] . 
[PER Sandomingo  ] made a point of saying during the lunch and again afterwards in private that [LOC Spain  ] would strongly prefer the [LOC U.S.  ] did not try to split [ORG EU  ] opinion on [LOC Cuba  ] . 
[PER A/S Shannon  ] emphasized the need for the international community to work together for meaningful democratic change and to continue to reach out to civil society and the dissidents . 
Several of the guests unconsciously echoed [PER Leon  ] 's and [ORG Aznar  ] 's concerns about [LOC Argentina  ] . 
Views on [LOC Venezuela  ] were negative , especially on the economic situation . 
[PER A/S Shannon  ] used the opportunity to describe the [LOC Merida  ] initiative , and he heard strong expressions of support for a [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG FTA  ] with [LOC Colombia  ] . 
Comment ------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) We were especially struck by the emphasis [PER Bernardino Leon  ] laid on cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] in [LOC Latin America  ] . 
His move from [ORG MFA  ] to the Presidency is rumored to have been prompted by [ORG Zapatero  ] 's dissatisfaction with the functioning of his first-term foreign policy apparatus . 
Reportedly his " odd man out " experience at the [LOC NATO Summit  ] in [LOC Bucharest  ] was the last straw . 
[PER Leon  ] is a credible player on foreign affairs and well-disposed towards the [LOC U.S.  ] Having him in a key position at the Presidency bodes well as does the resonance of [MISC Spanish  ] views with our own on most things [MISC Latin American  ] . 
[LOC Cuba  ] will continue to be the exception , at least when it comes to tactics , but on a great many other important issues in the [LOC Western Hemisphere  ] we believe [LOC Spain  ] is genuinely interested in working with the [LOC U.S.  ] and highly values [PER A/S Shannon  ] 's continuing attention . 
[ORG Aznar  ] remains well-briefed on [LOC Latin America  ] , knows the players , and frequently travels to the region , all good reasons for [LOC U.S.  ] officials to stay in touch with him .
