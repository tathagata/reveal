End Summary . 
2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [ORG Ambassador  ] paid an introductory call on [MISC Spanish  ] Minister of Industry , Tourism , and Commerce [PER Miguel Sebastian  ] on January 25 . 
[PER Sebastian  ] was accompanied by Secretary of State ( deputy minister ) for [ORG Telecommunications  ] and the [ORG Information Society Francisco Ros  ] , Secretary of State for energy [PER Pedro Marin  ] , Foreign Trade [ORG Institute  ] ( [ORG ICEX  ] ) CEO [PER Angel Martin-Acebes  ] , and two staffers . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] was accompanied by the economic and commercial counselors . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] opened by referring to his January 22 meeting with President [PER Zapatero  ] ( ref A ) and the importance he placed on strengthening business ties between the two countries . 
Internet Piracy --------------- 3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Ambassador  ] highlighted the difficulties faced by the [LOC U.S.  ] movie and recording industry in [LOC Spain  ] as a result of internet piracy . 
He acknowledged that some thought the Special 301 process was unfair but stressed that the issue needed to be addressed . 
He emphasized the [ORG USG  ] , s desire to help address the problem ( though he did not want to take a position on details of the legislation ) and said that he had met the previous week with the head of the opposition [ORG Popular Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) ( ref B ) to encourage a constructive approach . 
State Secretary [PER Ros  ] indicated that it would be helpful for the [ORG Ambassador  ] to continue to encourage the [ORG PP  ] . 
4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Minister [PER Sebastian  ] noted that immediately upon taking office in 2008 he had met with the [ORG Ambassador  ] 's predecessor , who had told him [LOC Spain  ] had been placed on the [ORG Watch List  ] . 
Since that time , the [ORG GOS  ] had made considerable progress on two of the issues that had been cited at the time , illegal software and street sales of counterfeit products . 
5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On the third ( comment: and most important ) issue , unauthorized internet downloads of movies and music , [PER Sebastian  ] said that many Spaniards thought the " digital canon " private copy levy on recording instruments and media gave them the right to download whatever they wanted . 
In addition , going after individual users was difficult for the [ORG GOS  ] , which did not want to jeopardize families , access to the internet just because one member downloaded unauthorized items . 
He said the [ORG GOS  ] had gotten the [ORG ISP  ] association to negotiate with the [ORG Coalition of  ] content providers . 
He described the political tension around the issue , saying the [ORG GOS  ] considered unfair both the [ORG MPAA  ] 's claim that it was overly permissive and the [ORG PP  ] 's and the internet users groups' claim that it was almost as repressive on internet issues as [LOC Iran  ] or [LOC China  ] or [LOC Cuba  ] . 
The Minister called " very worrisome " [ORG MADRID  ] 00000086 002.3 OF 004 the [ORG PP  ] 's initial reaction to the government 's first legislative proposal . 
He was particularly concerned that the [LOC Madrid  ] regional government had been organizing meetings with internet users . 
He understood the national party seeking political advantage , but he was concerned about the institutional aspects of the regional government getting involved , and he said it would be helpful if the Ambassador could encourage the regional president to stop . 
The Ambassador agreed to raise the issue when he meets with the regional president . 
6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Secretary [PER Ros  ] said that in his meetings in [LOC Washington  ] the previous week , [LOC Spain  ] 's efforts had been generally very well received . 
The software companies were " fine , " and the movie industry was also " happy . 
" However , the music industry still had problems , acted as if the [ORG GOS  ] had done nothing , and was not patient enough to wait for implementation of the law as would be necessary . 
( Comment: The [LOC U.S.  ] music industry says the draft legislation 's emphasis on closing websites will do very little to address direct peer-to-peer ( P2P ) filesharing , which is more of a problem for music than for movies . 
The [ORG GOS  ] says the legislation will have some impact on P2P filesharing as well . 
) [PER Ros  ] said everyone was waiting to see what happened with the draft law , which was now in a consultation stage that could last a month or a month and a half . 
Afterwards it would go to the [ORG Congress  ] , where the government is just short of a majority . 
If the [ORG PP  ] supported it , it could move quickly . 
If the [ORG PP  ] opposed it and proposed language changes , it could take longer . 
[PER Ros  ] also said that [LOC Spain  ] , s problem was like those in other countries and that fundamentally the industries' business models needed to change . 
He and Minister [PER Sebastian  ] both cited the importance of promoting legal downloads , which the Ministry is seeking to do . 
7 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Ros  ] also said his telecoms-related meetings had gone well and that his interlocutors had agreed to set up working groups to address issues such as cybersecurity , net neutrality , and next generation networks . 
8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: [PER Ros  ] had emphasized in his [LOC Washington  ] IPR meetings the importance of [ORG USG  ] engagement with the [ORG PP  ] , and this meeting confirmed the [ORG GOS'  ] interest . 
Post will continue our efforts to encourage national [ORG PP  ] figures to take a constructive approach toward the [ORG GOS'  ] proposed legislation . 
We will also engage with the regional government . 
[ORG Double Taxation Treaty  ] ---------------------- 9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Ambassador  ] noted that both he and the Minister wanted to promote business and jobs in our two countries and said that one issue companies raised was the need to revise the bilateral double taxation treaty . 
The [ORG USG  ] was awaiting a response to a letter that had been sent from [ORG Treasury  ] 's tax negotiating office to its [MISC Spanish  ] counterparts . 
Minister [PER Sebastian  ] said his ministry often pushed the issue with [LOC Spain  ] , s treasury . 
[PER Martin-Acebes  ] said the treasury was working on a response , and he agreed to the Ambassador 's request that he look into the issue and let us know when a response might be ready . 
Strengthening Business Ties --------------------------- 10 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [ORG Ambassador  ] and the Minister emphasized their joint interest in strengthening [MISC U.S.-Spain  ] business ties . 
[PER Sebastian  ] had traveled to the [LOC U.S.  ] four times in 2009 , and he described his involvement in the launch of the " Made in [LOC Spain  ] , Made by [LOC Spain  ] " awareness campaign in the [LOC U.S.  ] The Ambassador noted President [PER Zapatero  ] 's interest in a [MISC US-Spain  ] investment and economic forum he had proposed during his October visit to the [LOC White House  ] . 
[PER Martin-Acebes  ] said the presidency was working on the idea . 
The Ambassador recommended considering how to integrate [PER Zapatero  ] 's goals into the existing [ORG U.S.-Spain Council  ] and [ORG U.S.-Spain Forum  ] , which benefited from the commitment of Senator [PER Menendez  ] and others . 
The Minister expressed concern about the multiplication of different business groups that did not talk to each other , citing the [ORG U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Spain  ] ( [ORG AmCham  ] ) and the [ORG American Business Council  ] . 
He said that [ORG MADRID  ] 00000086 003.3 OF 004 adding a new forum/council would be difficult . 
[LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Companies' Solar Power Projects  ] ------------------------------------ 11 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) In emphasizing the importance he places on strengthening the bilateral economic relationship in order to create jobs , the Ambassador noted that [MISC Spanish  ] companies were the largest recipients in the [LOC U.S.  ] of stimulus funding for renewable energy projects . 
He said the [ORG USG  ] was glad to promote these investments , which resulted in [LOC U.S.  ] jobs . 
He also wanted favorable consideration of [LOC U.S.  ] companies , proposed investments in [LOC Spain  ] . 
He mentioned two planned solar thermal electricity investments by [LOC U.S.  ] companies , saying that both were important symbolically as well as for the direct amounts of investment and jobs they would bring . 
The investment by [ORG Florida Power and Light  ] subsidiary [ORG NextEra  ] now appeared to be in good shape and would be the largest new [LOC U.S.  ] investment in [LOC Spain  ] in several years . 
It would be an example of the two governments' shared confidence in renewable energy . 
12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) A greater concern was the difficulties faced by a large project by SolarReserve that was important both in terms of economic activity and technology development . 
Minister [PER Sebastian  ] responded by explaining how the [ORG GOS  ] had seen a bubble develop in solar photovoltaic electricity projects in 2008 and was seeing one in solar thermal projects in 2009 . 
In both cases , far more companies had applied to build projects and receive the generous guaranteed feed-in tariffs than the [ORG GOS  ] had expected , and the result was going to be very expensive to consumers for many years . 
He noted that the [ORG GOS  ] had changed its registration process to burst these bubbles , and that many [MISC Spanish  ] companies were very upset with the [ORG GOS  ] for doing so . 
13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Secretary of State [PER Marin  ] said [ORG Solar Reserve  ] had presented its application in December , several months after the May 6 deadline , and that the original [ORG GOS  ] target had been 500 MW of projects but that the [ORG GOS  ] had allowed 2,500 MW to be scheduled between now and 2013 . 
The [ORG GOS  ] could not predict now what the guaranteed feed-in tariff would be after 2013 because it would have to see how the technology evolved , though the tariff certainly would be lower . 
It would be difficult for the [ORG GOS  ] to allow [ORG Solar Reserve  ] to " jump the queue " ahead of all the other companies ( [PER Sebastian  ] said " thousands of megawatts " ) that had applied between May and December . 
[PER Marin  ] also noted that the company was seeking authorization for a larger project than the 50 MW allowed by the [ORG GOS  ] decree-law . 
He added that the company 's interest in using an alternative provision of the existing royal decree could not be accommodated because of overall capacity limits . 
He commented that the [ORG GOS  ] had authorized much new renewables capacity at a time when overall electricity demand was falling , and there might not be demand for new capacity for a while . 
14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ambassador acknowledged [PER Sebastian  ] 's and [PER Marin  ] 's comments . 
He noted that the company was willing to accept a tariff that was significantly lower than the tariff other companies were receiving ( note: this is a condition of the alternate legal route ) and urged the Minister and the Secretary to look at the company 's arguments again and see if anything could be done . 
He said the [ORG USG  ] interest was partly in business terms and partly because of the symbolic importance . 
[PER Marin  ] noted that his team had met with company officials recently and that he was familiar with their arguments . 
Other Issues ------------ 15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Minister [PER Sebastian  ] asked for help getting information from [ORG General Motors  ] about the company 's plans for [ORG Opel  ] ( which has a factory in [LOC Zaragoza  ] province ) . 
He said the company was keeping the [MISC British  ] government informed , but that the [ORG GOS  ] had to learn about developments in the press . 
[PER Sebastian  ] had been pleased with [ORG GM  ] 's decision to keep [ORG Opel  ] but wanted more information , or at least as much as the [MISC British  ] were getting . 
[ORG MADRID  ] 00000086 004.3 OF 004 16 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Minister [PER Sebastian  ] said [MISC Spanish  ] infrastructure companies were concerned about Buy [LOC America  ] legislative provisions . 
Upon being questioned by the Ambassador , [PER Martin-Acebes  ] could not come up with an example of a [MISC Spanish  ] investment that had been prevented because of national government restrictions . 
He instead cited a [LOC Texas  ] state action and general concern by construction companies about state and local actions , adding that the perception could become a deterrent to investment . 
Commercial counselor noted that [MISC Spanish  ] infrastructure companies were doing very well in the [LOC U.S.  ] and that the CAF railroad car manufacturer had recently reached an agreement ; the company would do more manufacturing in the [LOC U.S.  ] than it had originally envisioned , but it appeared to be satisfied . 
The Ambassador noted that the [MISC Embassy  ] could address a perception of barriers by highlighting the success [MISC Spanish  ] companies were having in the [LOC U.S.  ] 17 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Minister [PER Sebastian  ] noted [ORG GOS  ] concern about the [ORG One World Alliance  ] 's application for anti-trust immunity for the [MISC BA-Iberia  ] airline merger . 
He also noted the [MISC GOS'  ] strong interest in having a [MISC U.S.-EU  ] summit in [LOC Madrid  ] during [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG EU  ] presidency . 
He added that he expected the Defense Minister ( whom the Ambassador saw the next day ) to raise the interest of the [MISC Spanish  ] company [MISC EADS-Casa  ] ( [ORG Airbus Military  ] ) in the revised DOD tender for new refueling tanker aircraft . 
Comment ------- 18 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Minister [PER Sebastian  ] was clearly interested in establishing a productive relationship with the Ambassador . 
[PER Sebastian  ] made a point of assuring the Ambassador as the meeting broke up that his ministry " would try " on [ORG Solar Reserve  ] but that it would be very difficult . 
Another sign of the importance he placed on the relationship was the presence in the meeting of two deputy ministers , an agency head , and two other staffers , many more than usually attend such meetings .
