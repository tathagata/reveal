[PER Paoli  ] noted that the [MISC French  ] anticipate strong [MISC Israeli  ] resistance to [ORG USG  ] pressure on this issue . 
He asked whether the [ORG USG  ] has considered how to adapt to possible [MISC Israeli  ] responses: " How will you react to [MISC Israeli  ] reactions to your pressure ? 
" He claimed that " the credibility of President [PER Obama  ] will be judged on the issue of settlements . 
" MFA DAS [PER Ludovic Pouille  ] , who also attended the meeting , underlined this point: " [MISC Arabs  ] are saying progress on settlements is crucial .

[PER Pouille  ] said the [MISC French  ] can play an important role on " two key issues " : working toward a settlements freeze and monitoring the implementation of an eventual agreement .

" [PER Paoli  ] said that [PER Sarkozy  ] will stress that " there is a single door and it is imperative to move through it now . 
" [PER Paoli  ] and [PER Pouille  ] both expressed disappointment with the reservations contained in [PER Netanyahu  ] 's June 14 speech , but noted that it nonetheless reflected significant movement in the [ORG Likud  ] position regarding a [MISC Palestinian  ] state .
