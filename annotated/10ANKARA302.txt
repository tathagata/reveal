End Summary . 
[LOC IRAN  ] ---- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Burns  ] strongly urged [PER Sinirlioglu  ] to support action to convince the [MISC Iranian  ] government it is on the wrong course . 
Sinirliolgu reaffirmed the GoT 's opposition to a nuclear [LOC Iran  ] ; however , he registered fear about the collateral impact military action might have on [LOC Turkey  ] and contended sanctions would unite [MISC Iranians  ] behind the regime and harm the opposition . 
[PER Burns  ] acknowledged [LOC Turkey  ] 's exposure to the economic effects of sanctions as a neighbor to [LOC Iran  ] , but reminded [ORG Sinirlioglu Turkish  ] interests would suffer if [LOC Israel  ] were to act militarily to forestall [LOC Iran  ] 's acquisition of nuclear weapons or if [LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] were to seek nuclear arsenals of their own . 
He said the international community 's patience with [LOC Iran  ] had been met with the [MISC Iranian  ] refusal , since October , to work with the [LOC P5-plus-1  ] , the clandestine enrichment facility near [LOC Qom  ] and [LOC Tehran  ] 's recent decison to enrich its low-enriched uranium to 20% . 
The [ORG IAEA  ] 's creative proposal to fabricate new fuel assemblies for the [ORG Tehran Research Reactor  ] had stumbled on a technically unfeasible [MISC Iranian  ] counter-offer for a simultaneous exchange in [LOC Iran  ] of [MISC Iranian  ] fuel for fuel assemblies . 
Carefully constructed sanctions , [PER Burns  ] argued , targeting the increasingly pervasive economic power of the [ORG Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps  ] , would convey the international community 's unity and determination . 
" We'll keep the door open to engagement , " he stressed . 
A visibly disheartened [PER Sinirlioglu  ] conceded a unified message is important . 
He acknowledged the countries of the region perceive [LOC Iran  ] as a growing threat: " Alarm bells are ringing even in [LOC Damascus  ] . 
" [LOC ARMENIA  ] ------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Sinirlioglu  ] appealed for " simultaneity " between [MISC Armenian  ] Protocols ratification and the [ORG Minsk Process  ] . 
He emphasized " a strong reaction " against the protocols among ruling party MPs had to be overcome before the government would hazard a ratification effort . 
He warned [ORG Congressional  ] passage of an [MISC Armenian  ] genocide resolution would " complicate " his government 's domestic political calculations regarding ratification . 
He said if something acceptable to [MISC Azerbaijani  ] President [PER Aliyev  ] can found , then " we can move " the protocols forward . 
[PER Sinirlioglu  ] suggested [LOC Azerbaijan  ] and [LOC Armenia  ] 's announcement of an agreed framework for [ORG Minsk Group  ] progress would provide the GoT with the necessary political cover . 
[PER Burns  ] inquired about the prospect for progress on a natural gas deal between [LOC Turkey  ] and [LOC Azerbaijan  ] . 
[PER Sinirlioglu  ] implied [LOC ANKARA  ] 00000302 002 OF 005 [PER Aliyev  ] is holding an agreement hostage to [LOC Turkey  ] 's handling of the protocols: " He doesn't trust us . 
" [LOC IRAQ  ] ---- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Sinirlioglu  ] registered the GoT 's increasing dissatisfaction with PM Malaki and fear that he is tending " to get out of control . 
" " He is preoccupied with his political survival ; " nevertheless , [PER Sinirlioglu  ] continued , the GoT is in frequent contact with him . 
The MFA hosted [PER Maliki  ] advisors [PER Sadiq al Rikabi  ] and [PER Tariq al Najmi  ] to meetings 10 days prior . 
[PER Sinirlioglu  ] lamented [LOC Iran  ] 's efforts to influence the election . 
He noted [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] is also " throwing around money " among the political parties in [LOC Iraq  ] because it is unwilling to accept the inevitability of [LOC Shia  ] dominance there . 
" We want a free , transparent and fair election , " he said , " we need to forestall a deepening of the sectarian divide . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) After the March 7 elections , [PER Sinirlioglu  ] said , [LOC Turkey  ] would initiate an effort to connect [MISC Iraqi  ] gas fields to the [MISC Turkish  ] grid via a 300 kilometer pipeline , costing USD 500 million . 
He asserted the pipeline could begin pumping within two years . 
He alleged [MISC Iranian  ] opposition to the pipeline because most of [LOC Iraq  ] 's gas fields are in [MISC Kurdish  ] and [MISC Sunni  ] areas . 
[PER Sinirlioglu  ] advocated a second pipeline that would give [MISC Iraqi  ] oil an alternative to the [LOC Gulf  ] as a route to [LOC Europe  ] once the country is able to meet its [ORG OPEC  ] quota . 
He asserted the piplines' construction would pull the several [MISC Iraqi  ] communities together into a common project . 
The creation of new " common assets , " he said , could be more important for its politically unifying effect than its economic impact. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Sinirlioglu  ] registered his appreciation for [MISC USF-I  ] Commanding General Odierno 's recent visit . 
He hoped for the early drafting of an action plan that would elicit more cooperation from the [MISC Kurdish  ] [LOC Regional Government  ] ( [ORG KRG  ] ) against the terrorist [ORG Kurdistan Workers Party  ] ( [ORG PKK  ] ) leadership harboring in northern [MISC Iraq:  ] " We want the [ORG KRG  ] to understand that working with us is important . 
" [LOC ISRAEL  ] ------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Burns  ] focused on [LOC Turkey  ] 's strained relationship with [LOC Israel  ] . 
[PER Sinirlioglu  ] argued " the problem is not bilateral , but general . 
" He attributed increasing regional country frustration with [LOC Israel  ] to the stalled [ORG Peace Process  ] , especially on the [MISC Palestinian  ] track . 
He blamed the lack of progress on [MISC Israeli  ] intransigence , which caused regional stake-holders to question [PER Netanyahu  ] 's goals . 
He contended the " humanitarian situation in [LOC Gaza  ] , " which is not a punishment of [ORG Hamas  ] , but of the [MISC Gazan  ] people , fed [MISC Turkish  ] popular anger against [LOC Israel  ] . 
Even so , bilateral cooperation with [LOC Israel  ] is continuing . 
[LOC Turkey  ] is acquiring [MISC Israeli  ] military equipment , notably [PER Heron UAVs  ] . 
Direct flights between the two countries are routine . 
Two-way trade is healthy , he said , tourism has dropped recently , but " will recover . 
" [PER Sinirlioglu  ] described [MISC Israeli  ] Defense Minister [PER Ehud Barak  ] 's mid-January visit as " very good . 
" He noted the MFA is exploring the possibility of arranging a meeting between the two prime ministers on the margins of an international gathering . 
Returning to a GoT obsession , he recalled the [MISC Turkey-brokered  ] Syria-Israel proximity talks , " which were shattered by Cast Lead , " [LOC Israel  ] 's December 2008 military operation in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
[PER Burns  ] noted [LOC Syria  ] places high value on [LOC Turkey  ] 's role as a mediator and repeated [PER Senator Mitchell  ] 's statement that [MISC Turkey-brokered  ] proximity talks can make an important contribution to the [ORG Peace Process  ] . 
[ORG ANKARA  ] 00000302 003 OF 005 [LOC SYRIA  ] ----- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Sinirlioglu  ] contended [LOC Turkey  ] 's diplomatic efforts are beginning to pull [LOC Syria  ] out of [LOC Iran  ] 's orbit . 
He said a shared hatred for [PER Saddam  ] had been the original impetus for their unlikely alliance . 
" Now , their interests are diverging . 
" Once again pitching [MISC Israel-Syria  ] proximity talks , [PER Sinirlioglu  ] contended [LOC Israel  ] 's acceptance of [LOC Turkey  ] as a mediator could break [LOC Syria  ] free of [LOC Tehran  ] 's influence and further isolate [LOC Iran  ] . 
[ORG EU  ] , [LOC CYPRUS  ] and [LOC GREECE  ] --------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Sinirlioglu  ] said [LOC Turkey  ] 's [ORG EU  ] accession is being obstructed by the politically motivated objections of several member states , notably [LOC France  ] , [LOC Austria  ] and [LOC Cyprus  ] . 
He reserved special criticism for President [PER Sarkozy  ] . 
He accused [LOC France  ] of changing the rules mid-game . 
He contended [MISC French  ] opposition to [LOC Turkey  ] 's membership is " deepening the cultural divide " between [MISC Christian Europe  ] and the [MISC Muslim  ] world: " A wider audience is watching this . 
" <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) He regretted perceived [MISC Greek  ] Cypriot complacency regarding the island 's reunification talks: [ORG EU  ] " membership makes them invulnerable . 
" [MISC Greek  ] [PER Cypriots  ] , he said , want the world to forget the progress achieved by the [ORG Annan Plan  ] in <a id='par2004' href='#par2004'>¶</a>2004 . 
They pretend relations between the island 's two communities are an internal affair , even though , by treaty , it 's been an international issue for 50 years . 
[PER Talat  ] 's cross-voting proposal , [PER Sinirlioglu  ] continued , should have been a breakthrough , but the [MISC Greek  ] [PER Cypriots  ] failed to react . 
Downer is frustrated , [PER Sinirlioglu  ] alleged , and so are the [MISC Turkish  ] [PER Cypriots  ] . 
He implied the island 's [MISC Turkish  ] community would register its frustration by voting out [PER Talat  ] as [ORG TRNC  ] " president " in April . 
He renewed [LOC Turkey  ] 's appeal for higher profile direct [ORG USG  ] involvement in the negotiations. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Sinirlioglu  ] welcomed [MISC Greek  ] PM Papandeou 's belated response to [ORG Erdogan  ] 's October 30 letter seeking a frank new discussion of the two neighbors' several long-running disputes . 
He conceded [PER Papandreou  ] 's delay is understandable in light of his likely preoccupation with [LOC Greece  ] 's acute financial crisis . 
Based on [PER Papandreou  ] 's response , [PER Sinirlioglu  ] said , [LOC Turkey  ] expects to begin new talks with [LOC Greece  ] soon . 
[LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] , [LOC PAKISTAN  ] and [LOC INDIA  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Burns  ] opened the discussion on [LOC Afghanistan  ] with praise for [LOC Turkey  ] 's military , training and development contributions there . 
[PER Sinirlioglu  ] said [LOC Turkey  ] had chosen to focus on three [MISC Afghan  ] challenges: " the marriage of [MISC Wahhabism  ] and [MISC Pashtun  ] nationalism " ; the chronic antagonism between [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] , and ; the country 's security forces deficit . 
He said [LOC Turkey  ] plans to address the first by ramping up its education programs in [LOC Afghanistan  ] ; the second by pursuing its trilateral [ORG Ankara Process  ] , which sponsors meetings of senior [MISC Afghan  ] and [MISC Pakistani  ] ministerial and intelligence counterparts , and ; the third by establishing a police training center in [LOC Kabul  ] that aims for a throughput of 5160 trainees per year . 
Keying off the last point , AMB [PER Tacan Ildem  ] , who recently concluded an assignment as [LOC Turkey  ] 's [ORG NATO  ] PERMREP , declared the [MISC EUPOL  ] police training effort in [LOC Afghanistan  ] a failure . 
He said the [ORG EU  ] 's criticism of [LOC Turkey  ] 's unwillingness to work directly with [MISC EUPOL  ] is unjustified . 
He argued , since [LOC Turkey  ] does not have a security agreement with the [ORG EU  ] and is excluded from the [ORG ANKARA  ] 00000302 004 OF 005 [ORG European Security and Defense Policy  ] ( [ORG ESDP  ] ) , the GoT lacks a legal basis on which to cooperate with [MISC EUPOL  ] . 
" We would like the [ORG EU  ] to involve us not as a third country , but , in view of our accumulated rights , " as a candidate for membership . 
He urged the [ORG USG  ] not to coordinate bilateral agreements to support [ORG EU  ] operations but , instead , to route all cooperation with the [ORG EU  ] on security issues through [MISC NATO.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Deputy Undersecretary for [MISC South Asian  ] Affairs [PER Engin Soysal  ] led the discussion on [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
He described the [ORG Ankara Process  ] and the recent Turkey-sponsored [LOC Afghanistan  ] Neighbors Summit as [MISC Turkish  ] efforts to assert regional responsibility for [LOC South Asia  ] 's inter-linked problems . 
He said [LOC Turkey  ] had not invited [LOC India  ] to the neighbors summit in deference to [MISC Pakistani  ] sensitivities ; however , he claimed , [LOC Pakistan  ] understands attempting to exclude [LOC India  ] from the nascent [MISC South Asian  ] regional structures would be a mistake . 
He reported [MISC Indian  ] Prime Minister [PER Singh  ] had requested President [PER Gul  ] 's assistance with [LOC Pakistan  ] during the latter 's visit to [LOC New Delhi  ] the previous week . 
Acting on that request , [PER Gul  ] had phoned [MISC Pakistani  ] President [PER Zardari  ] , who was skeptical of [MISC Indian  ] intentions . 
[PER Gul  ] is planning to visit [LOC Pakistan  ] later this year . 
[PER Soysal  ] said [LOC Iran  ] is proposing a quadrilateal summit , which would include [LOC Turkey  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] , but that proposal had yet to generate enthusiasm. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Soysal  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] 's former ambassador to [LOC Pakistan  ] , said the [MISC Pakistani  ] military , though displeased with [PER Zardari  ] , remains unwilling to intervene ; nevertheless , senior officers' patience may not be infinite . 
[PER Zardari  ] needs to increase the democratic legitimacy of parliament . 
[PER Soysal  ] offered . 
[PER Nawaz Sharif  ] has become a much more constructive player. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER Soysal  ] urged a [ORG NATO  ] training role in [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
Picking up from [PER Soysal  ] , [PER Tacan Ildem  ] suggested [ORG NATO  ] invite [MISC Pakistani  ] military officers to courses at [LOC Oberammergau  ] . 
[LOC BOSNIA  ] ------ <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [PER Sinirlioglu  ] registered the GoT 's determination to resist perceived [ORG EU  ] efforts to exclude [LOC Turkey  ] from the [LOC Balkans  ] , particularly [LOC Bosnia  ] . 
He identified effecting rapprochement between [LOC Bosnia  ] and [LOC Serbia  ] as [LOC Turkey  ] 's immediate diplomatic goal for the region . 
Towards that end , [PER Sinirlioglu  ] said , we convinced [PER Haris Siladjdzic  ] , who had been in [LOC Ankara  ] the day before , to cease references to [MISC Serbian  ] " genocide . 
" The [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Turkey  ] have " agreed to disagree " on the [ORG Membership Action Plan  ] ( [ORG MAP  ] ) for [LOC Bosnia  ] ; nevertheless , " we value your involvement in the [LOC Balkans  ] . 
" BILATERAL EUROPEAN RELATIONS , [ORG NATO  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [PER Burns  ] inquired about [LOC Turkey  ] 's bilateral relations with [LOC Europe  ] . 
[PER Sinirlioglu  ] briefly recapped [LOC Turkey  ] 's unhappiness with [PER Sarkozy  ] . 
He described his country 's relationship with [LOC Austria  ] as infected by the latter 's ethnic prejudice . 
He complained [LOC Belgium  ] and [LOC Denmark  ] are reluctant to suppress terrorist PKK-affiliated organizations active in their countries . 
[PER Tacan Ildem  ] added that , as part of the 2009 [MISC POTUS-brokered  ] deal that had overcome [MISC Turkish  ] objections to the appointment of [PER Anders Fogh Rasmussen  ] as [ORG NATO  ] Secretary General , [LOC Denmark  ] had promised to clarify its legal requirements prerequiste to acceding to [LOC Turkey  ] 's request for the closure of [PER Roj TV  ] , a PKK mouthpiece . 
This still needed to be done , [PER Ildem  ] said. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) Picking up from [PER Ildem  ] , [PER Sinirlioglu  ] recalled the [ORG ANKARA  ] 00000302 005 OF 005 [MISC POTUS-brokered  ] deal had included an understanding that a qualified [MISC Turk  ] would be considered for Assistant Secretary General . 
Instead , he said , a [MISC German  ] of uncompelling merit was selected . 
" We suspect a deal between [PER Rasmussen  ] and [PER Merkel  ] . 
" [PER Ildem  ] complained high-level positions should be part of [ORG NATO  ] reform: " We missed an opportunity with the selection of the Assistant Secretary General . 
" [PER Sinirlioglu  ] added: " We let [PER Rasmussen  ] have Secretary General , because we trusted you . 
" MISSILE DEFENSE --------------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) [PER Sinirlioglu  ] inquired about [LOC Russia  ] 's reaction on missile defense . 
[PER Burns  ] said the [MISC Russians  ] are much more relaxed towards the [ORG Phased Adaptive Approach  ] ( [ORG PAA  ] ) and we hope to have more conversations on missile defense bilaterally and , eventually , within the [ORG NATO-Russia Council  ] . 
[PER Sinirlioglu  ] recalled PM [PER Erdogan  ] 's request in his recent meeting with [ORG SECDEF Gates  ] that the [MISC Iranian  ] threat not be highlighted to justify [MISC PAA.  ] <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( U ) Participants: [LOC Turkey  ] Undersecretary [PER Feridun Sinirliolgu  ] Deputy Undersecretary [PER Engin Soysal  ] Ambassador [PER Reha Keskintepe  ] , Director General for the [ORG Americas  ] Ambassador [PER Tacan Ildem  ] , Director General for [ORG International Security Affairs  ] Ambassador [PER Aydin Sezgin  ] , Director General for [ORG Intelligence and Security Affairs  ] Ebru [PER Barat Gokdenizler  ] , Deputy Director General for the [ORG Americas  ] [PER Serhat Aksen  ] , [ORG Department Head , Americas United States  ] Undersecretary [PER William Burns Ambassador James Jeffrey Deputy Assistant Secretary Tina Kaidanow Bridget Brink  ] , [ORG NSC  ] [PER Daniel O'Grady  ] , Political Counselor [PER Tamir Waser  ] , P Staff [PER Jeremiah Howard  ] , Deputy Political Counselor - Notetaker <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 .
