( C ) On September 4 , [ORG BP  ] announced that it had reached an agreement with [ORG AAR  ] , its partners in [ORG TNK-BP  ] , to resolve the ongoing dispute ( reftels ) over the future of the company . 
The agreement includes the departure of current CEO [PER Bob Dudley  ] by December 1 , a new board structure , and an option to conduct an [ORG IPO  ] in the " medium-term . 
" [ORG TNK-BP  ] VP for [ORG International Affairs Shawn McCormick  ] ( protect ) told us the deal was bad for [ORG BP  ] , which had " caved " because of the company 's deteriorating situation worldwide . 
[ORG BP Russia  ] President [PER Richard Spies  ] ( protect ) told us in a separate meeting on September 4 that the deal was " good news . 
" [PER Spies  ] said [ORG BP  ] retains ownership and dividend flows and the [ORG IPO  ] will have a disciplining effect on [ORG AAR  ] 's behavior . 
The agreement is not yet legally adopted but should end the downward spiral of the company . 
Overall , however , the damage to [LOC Russia  ] 's investment climate is likely to linger . 
End summary. ------------------ [ORG BP  ] SEES [ORG IPO  ] AS KEY ------------------ 2 . 
( SBU ) Following months of behind-the-scenes negotiations led by [ORG BP  ] CEO [PER Tony Hayward  ] and [ORG AAR  ] partner [PER Mikhail Fridman  ] , the two sides have come to an agreement spelling out a way forward for [ORG TNK-BP  ] , their embattled joint venture . 
3 . 
( C ) Perhaps the most valuable part of the agreement for [ORG BP  ] is the stipulation that the partners will prepare to issue an [ORG IPO  ] of up to 20% of [ORG TNK-BP Holding  ] , the main subsidiary of [ORG TNK-BP Ltd  ] . 
According to [PER Spies  ] , [ORG AAR  ] 's interest in raising the value of the company in preparation for the [ORG IPO  ] should prevent [ORG AAR  ] from pulling too much cash out of the company , either in dividends or by even less transparent means . 
[PER McCormick  ] agreed that the [ORG IPO  ] was the most valuable part of the deal for [ORG BP  ] . 
According to [PER Spies  ] , the [ORG IPO  ] would only take place in the medium-term ( 1-2 years ) , as [ORG AAR  ] seeks to bolster the value of the company before a sale and overcome the current market and investor malaise . 
4 . 
( C ) The [ORG AAR  ] partners have reportedly long sought a way to cash-out some of their stake in the company and have wanted a more convincing benchmark for [ORG TNK-BP  ] 's true market value than is provided by the current 3% float . 
In addition , the [ORG IPO  ] would bring in foreign shareholders less likely to accept any attempt by state firms to later acquire any part of [ORG TNK-BP  ] at a discount to market . 
( [ORG Note:  ] The [ORG BVI-registered TNK-BP Ltd.  ] will continue to be owned 50-50 by [ORG BP  ] and [ORG AAR  ] . 
The floated shares will not allow shareholders much , if any , say in the operations of the company , which would still answer to [ORG TNK-BP Ltd  ] . 
End note . 
) ------------------------------------------- CHANGES TO TOP MANAGEMENT WEAKEN GOVERNANCE ------------------------------------------- 5 . 
( C ) Both [PER Spies  ] and [PER McCormick  ] confirmed that [ORG BP  ] had agreed to the removal of [PER Bob Dudley  ] as CEO . 
[PER Spies  ] said both sides are currently reviewing possible candidates to replace [PER Dudley  ] , who will leave his post December 1 . 
He told us [ORG BP  ] agreed to nominate a CEO who is not affiliated with [ORG BP  ] or [ORG AAR  ] , who has extensive management experience in [LOC Russia  ] , and who has excellent [MISC Russian  ] language skills -- " in effect , a [MISC Russian  ] . 
" He added that [PER Dudley  ] would be looked after by both [ORG BP  ] and [ORG AAR  ] . 
[PER McCormick  ] noted that a key check on [ORG AAR  ] 's influence has always been specific legal powers entrusted to the person of [PER Bob Dudley  ] . 
He expressed concern that these powers would be diluted under a new CEO . 
6 . 
( C ) While [ORG BP  ] 's statement on the deal stressed the importance of corporate governance and transparency , [PER McCormick  ] said he believes the deal specifically reduces the ability of [ORG BP  ] to control either . 
He said the new make-up of the board , to include three " independent " members to be agreed upon by both sides , will likely favor [ORG AAR  ] , taking away [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00002671 002 OF 003 the critical 50-50 arrangement that was the major check on [ORG AAR  ] malfeasance . 
Moreover , [PER McCormick  ] said [ORG AAR  ] co-owners [PER Viktor Vekselberg  ] and [MISC German  ] Khan will remain in their current positions as part of the " core " leadership of the company , further diluting [ORG BP  ] 's influence . 
For his part , [PER Spies  ] stressed that the agreement includes a mechanism to ensure the independence of the new directors by requiring arbitration if the two sides can't agree on a director. ------ EXPATS ------ 7 . 
( C ) [PER McCormick  ] said the contentious issue of foreign employees remains to be worked out . 
He noted however , that slightly less than 60 expat employees remain at the company , down from about 235 in June . 
He added that he thinks nearly all remaining foreigners have an eye out to leave the company , with most having no interest in going to work for [ORG BP  ] . 
[PER McCormick  ] said in strictest confidence that [PER James Owen  ] , the [ORG CFO  ] who resigned recently resigned , left because he was increasingly being pressured by the [ORG AAR  ] owners to sign accounting and financial documents that were patently falsified . 
According to contacts at the [MISC French  ] embassy here , [PER Tony Considine  ] , in charge of refining and marketing and one of the most widely respected expats in the [MISC Russian  ] oil sector , left the company in part because he couldn't do his job in the face of pressure to redirect oil and other products to [MISC AAR-favored  ] traders. ---------------------------- A GOOD DEAL , OR DID [ORG BP  ] CAVE ? ---------------------------- 8 . 
( C ) [PER Spies  ] called the deal " good news " in that it allows the company to keep its 50% share and remain in [LOC Russia  ] . 
In addition to [MISC Spies'  ] spin , [ORG BP  ] 's press release on the deal is also positive while [ORG AAR  ] 's release is relatively glowing and includes quotes from Deputy Premier [PER Igor Sechin  ] and Presidential [PER Aide Arkady Dvorkovich  ] praising the deal as sending a " positive signal for the [MISC Russian  ] market . 
" Indeed , [PER Spies  ] said [ORG BP  ] understands that [ORG AAR  ] arranged for this deal to receive a " nod from appropriate levels . 
" [PER Spies  ] was " optimistic " that [ORG TNK-BP  ] 's various administrative problems ( reftels ) -- labor code violations , tax inspections , visa troubles -- would " go into hibernation . 
" 9 . 
( C ) Despite the public pronouncements , however , it appears [ORG BP  ] got less than it gave . 
Both [PER Spies  ] and [PER McCormick  ] noted that [ORG AAR  ] got basically all it wanted , including the green light on some international expansion that was more limited in the original shareholder agreement . 
[PER Spies  ] admitted that although neither he nor anyone in [ORG BP  ] would " officially " say so , [ORG BP  ] 's power has been diluted under the new deal . 
[PER McCormick  ] expressed general frustration with [ORG BP  ] for not having defended its interests forcefully enough . 
He said [ORG BP  ] had been forced to give in by its deteriorating situation worldwide . 
[ORG BP  ] 's stock was down 30 percent in recent months and there were credible reports of potential takeover attempts by [ORG Chevron  ] and others . 
In addition , he said [ORG BP  ] had gotten wind that [LOC Standard  ] and [LOC Poor  ] 's was considering lowering [ORG BP  ] 's credit rating . 
This had caused [ORG BP  ] Chairman [PER Peter Sutherland  ] , who had been opposed to the deal , to shift 180 degrees. ------------- WILL IT HOLD ? ------------- 10 . 
( C ) According to [PER McCormick  ] and [PER Spies  ] , the [ORG MOU  ] signed by the two sides is still not a binding document , but a " blueprint " for a binding contract that should be completed by the end of the year . 
[ORG Alfa Bank Chief Strategist  ] [PER Ron Smith  ] told us September 5 that the agreement " appears to be the real deal , " allowing the company to move forward . 
[PER Chris Weafer  ] , chief strategist of investment bank [ORG UralSib  ] , was more cautious , suggesting in press statements that [ORG TNK-BP  ] has much work to do to regain investor confidence . 
In a private e-mail exchange with us , [PER Weafer  ] predicted that the deal would probably break down by early spring . 
[PER Weafer  ] also did not discount the possibility that a GOR-approved takeover by [ORG Gazprom  ] ( or Rosneft ) might still be in the cards. ------- [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00002671 003 OF 003 COMMENT ------- 11 . 
( C ) [ORG BP  ] may have gotten the best deal it could have under the circumstances . 
They preserved their sizable investment and have stabilized the company 's downward spiral for now . 
That said , it would appear they got the short end of the stick and their control of the company has been weakened . 
In addition , while the deal is likely to increase [ORG TNK-BP  ] 's short-term value , it may not have much of an effect on overall investor confidence given that [ORG AAR  ] 's tactics may be seen as successful and therefore might be repeated .
