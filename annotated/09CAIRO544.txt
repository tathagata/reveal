KEY POINTS — ( C ) Egypt’s bloggers are playing an increasingly important role in broadening the scope of acceptable political and social discourse , and self-expression. -- ( C ) Bloggers’ discussions of sensitive issues , such as sexual harassment , sectarian tension and the military , represent a significant change from five years ago , and have influenced society and the media. -- ( C ) The role of bloggers as a cohesive activist movement has largely disappeared , due to a more restrictive political climate , [ORG GOE  ] counter-measures , and tensions among bloggers. -- ( C ) However , individual bloggers have continued to work to expose problems such as police brutality and corporate malfeasance. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Comment: The government generally allows bloggers wide latitude in posting material critical of the [ORG GOE  ] . 
Exceptions to this policy are bloggers who directly insult President [PER Mubarak  ] or [PER Islam  ] , and the government has arrested and jailed bloggers who have crossed these red-lines . 
The [ORG GOE  ] has also arrested activists , such as [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , who have used blogging to organize and support protests ( refs A and C ) . 
Activists are increasingly writing blogs to advance their political aims . 
Contacts accurately point out that bloggers have ceased to function as a cohesive activist movement . 
It is noteworthy that bloggers did not play a significant role in the most recent example of mass cyber-activism — the April 6 , 2008 strike orchestrated through [ORG Facebook  ] ( ref G ) . ----------------------------- The Current State of Blogging ----------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [LOC Egypt  ] has an estimated 160,000 bloggers who write in [MISC Arabic  ] , and sometimes in [MISC English  ] , about a wide variety of topics , from social life to politics to literature . 
One can view posts ranging from videos of alleged police brutality ( ref B ) , to comments about the [MISC GOE’s  ] foreign policy , to complaints about separate lines for men and women in government offices distributing drivers’ licenses . 
One NGO contact estimated for us that a solid majority of bloggers are between 20 and 35 years old , and that about 30 percent of blogs focus on politics . 
Blogs have spread throughout the population to become vehicles for a wide range of activists , students , journalists and ordinary citizens to express their views on almost any issue they choose . 
As such , the blogs have significantly broadened the range of topics that [MISC Egyptians  ] are able to discuss publicly. ------------------------------------------- Expanding Discourse and [ORG Personal Expression  ] ------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that blogging allows [MISC Egyptian  ] youth to air their views about social and political issues in ways that were “unimaginable five years ago.” [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that blog debates currently cover formerly “taboo” topics , such as Christian-Muslim tensions and the military’s potential role in succession . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , a blogger who now concentrates on journalism and film-making , described how bloggers began public discussions of issues , such as sexual harassment and the legal status of [LOC Bahai’is  ] , that were previously too sensitive to discuss . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] attributed the media’s sympathetic treatment of the Bahai’is’ national identification card case in January 2008 , in comparison with skeptical media coverage of the issue in 2004 , to bloggers’ efforts . 
[LOC CAIRO  ] 00000544 002 OF 003 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Two young upper middle-class bloggers told us that expressing themselves on their blogs is a “bright spot” for them in the current atmosphere of political , economic and social malaise . 
They noted that blogging provides them with an outlet , which they perceive as relatively anonymous , to disseminate criticism . 
One of them expressed satisfaction over being able to attack the “religious hypocrisy” and the “serious problems” in the society . 
A third blogger told us that she uses her blog to discuss whatever issues may be bothering her: her views on dysfunction in the [LOC Sinai  ] , the prime minister’s latest speech , or the [LOC Obama  ] administration’s [LOC Middle East  ] diplomacy . 
She has written critically about issues , such as the [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ( ref F ) , without any [ORG GOE  ] attempts to silence her. --------------------------------------- Relationship with the [ORG Independent Media  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that the open atmosphere created by bloggers has positively influenced the independent media , especially satellite television , to discuss sensitive issues such as sexuality and abortion . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] explained that while bloggers originally pushed the independent press to tackle new issues in 2006 , the independent press has now overtaken the blogs in breaking important news . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] asserted that while bloggers did ground-breaking reporting on sexual assaults in 2006 before the independent press covered the issue , bloggers are now recycling news stories that the independent press breaks . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , the relationship between bloggers and the independent press has come full circle , as bloggers now depend on the independent press for news. ------------------------------- Originally an [ORG Activist Movement  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) While the voices of individual bloggers are currently making their mark on expanding public discourse and personal expression , bloggers originally saw themselves as a cohesive movement of political activists . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , said that in 2006 , bloggers with diverse orientations — secular , [MISC Islamist  ] , and leftist -- worked together to organize events , such as a sit-in protest at the [ORG Judges’ Club  ] ( ref I ) and demonstrations in [LOC Tahrir Square  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] characterized bloggers during this period as activists who worked closely with civil society organizations to raise public awareness of issues , such as sexual assault . 
Because of bloggers’ independent , relatively anonymous identities , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] continued , they were able to engage on these issues more freely than [ORG NGOs  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believes that female bloggers’ personal accounts of being harassed put an important personal face on the problem. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Since 2006 , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , bloggers have not been able to replicate the same kind of political activism for a number of reasons . 
He cited growing tensions and divisions within the blogger community , where [MISC Islamist  ] bloggers are openly critical of secular and [MISC Christian  ] bloggers . 
As part of the [MISC GOE’s  ] increasing crack-down on political reformers since 2005-6 , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , State Security ( [ORG SSIS  ] ) began to target bloggers . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , and of pressuring western news organizations to dismiss other bloggers who challenged the [ORG GOE  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that many bloggers have abandoned their blogs due to this pressure , and are focusing instead on careers in journalism and civil society. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] explained that as political activism waned after 2006 , bloggers lost their context for advocacy . 
He concluded that there is currently no political opening for bloggers to push for significant change , and predicted that the next opportunities may be during the 2011 presidential election . 
Human rights activist [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] separately echoed XXXXXXXXXXXX’ assessment , opining that there is a current “despondency” among bloggers , whom [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] considers to be part of the broader activist community . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] asserted that in the current “political stagnation , ” bloggers are bereft of compelling and achievable political causes , but [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] predicted they would play a crucial role “during the eventual succession.” ---------------------------------- Bloggers as Human Rights Activists [LOC CAIRO  ] 00000544 003 OF 003 ---------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) While [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] minimizes bloggers’ current impact as activists , veteran civil society advocates view bloggers’ contributions as significant . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stressed the importance of bloggers’ concern with torture and press freedom . 
At a public lecture [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] human rights lawyer [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] lauded [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] for posting an alleged police sodomy video a few days earlier ( ref B ) , and for breaking the [PER El-Kebir  ] police brutality case . 
In November 2007 , a court sentenced two polic officers to three years in prison for assaultin and sodomizing bus driver [PER Imad El-Kebir  ] . 
The cse gained notoriety after [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] a cell phoe video recording of the attack ( ref H ) . <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] cited the “3,000 hits per day” on XXXXXXXXXXXX’ blogas evidence of his influence , asserting that [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] is more widely read than “Rose [PER Al Youssef  ] , ” th SSIS-backed daily newspaper . 
Separately , a human rights lawyer [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] marveled at [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] power to expose police brutality on his blog . 
Bloggers have also been active on other issues .
