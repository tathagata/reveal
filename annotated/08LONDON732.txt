( C/NF ) Summary . 
The [ORG UK’s Liberal Democrat Party  ] limped into its spring conference in [ORG Liverpool  ] March 7-9 following a disastrous performance in the [ORG House of Commons  ] March 5 during the debate over a possible referendum on the [ORG Lisbon Treaty  ] , a performance which plunged [PER Nick Clegg  ] into the first crisis of his three month-old leadership . 
[PER Clegg  ] managed to rally the party with a strong speech at the conference , in which he called for a shake-up of the entire [MISC British  ] political system . 
He also addressed head-on the possibility of a future coalition with either the [ORG Labour  ] or [ORG Conservative  ] parties in the event of a hung parliament , declaring the [ORG Lib Dems  ] would never be an “annex” to any other party , but leaving the door open for a coalition if [ORG Lib  ] Dem concerns were taken into account . 
Despite the [ORG Lisbon Treaty  ] fiasco , Clegg’s position as party leader is in no jeopardy: as the third leader in two years , [ORG Lib Dems  ] at all levels of the party tell us frankly that they have to make sure he succeeds . 
End summary . 
A Very Bad [MISC Day:  ] The [ORG Lib Dems  ] and The [ORG EU Reform Treaty  ] --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) March 5 marked the worst day for the [ORG Lib Dems  ] since one infamous week in January 2006 , when the party became the laughing stock of [LOC Britain  ] after sex scandals involving two of the four candidates to succeed leader [PER Charles Kennedy  ] emerged one right after the other . 
This time around , the party imploded in the [ORG House of Commons  ] over a [ORG Conservative Party  ] motion to hold a nationwide referendum on the [ORG Lisbon Treaty  ] . 
The [ORG Lib Dems’  ] convoluted official position on the referendum was part of the problem . 
As [PER Clegg  ] sought to explain it to the public , the real issue for his intensely pro-Europe rank-and-file was not the [ORG Lisbon Treaty  ] itself , but confirming [LOC UK  ] membership in the [ORG EU  ] once and for all . 
The [ORG Lib Dem  ] official position therefore was to propose an alternate “in or out” referendum on whether the [LOC UK  ] should remain in the [ORG EU  ] , and abstain on the competing [ORG Conservative  ] motion to hold a referendum on just the [ORG Treaty  ] itself. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) This position left both the pundits and the public scratching their heads: why would the [ORG UK’s  ] most pro-Europe party , whose new leader actually worked for the [ORG EU  ] from 1994 to 1999 , abstain on a vote on the [ORG Treaty  ] ? 
The answer , senior [ORG Lib Dems  ] have confessed to us , is that the party leadership believes a referendum on the [ORG Lisbon Treaty  ] would fail . 
Despite Labour’s parliamentary majority , if there had been enough [ORG Labour  ] defections , a [ORG Lib Dem  ] vote for the [MISC Tory  ] referendum could have led to its passage . 
In the end , the “least worst scenario , ” according to [ORG Shadow International Development  ] Minister [PER Michael Moore  ] , was to adopt the awkward position of abstention . 
This unspoken subtext was derided by pundits , one of whom called it “too clever by half.” Another summed up the [ORG Lib Dem  ] position as “sinuous , supple , and so difficult to understand it’s not worth getting to grips with.” [PER Nick Clegg  ] and His “Cojones” ---------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In any case , [PER Clegg  ] failed to carry it off . 
As expected , the [ORG Lib Dem  ] motion to hold a separate “in or out” referendum on [LOC UK  ] membership in the [ORG EU  ] failed in the [ORG Commons  ] on February 26 , but the staged [ORG Lib Dem  ] walk-out afterwards , accompanied by jeering and good-bye waves from the rest of the [ORG House  ] , did not come across as principled , as the party had hoped , but rather as if they were in the throes of a “hissy fit , ” in the words of one [ORG BBC  ] commentator . 
It didn’t help that , on the same day , the [MISC Guardian  ] published a quote [PER Clegg  ] made prior to the 2005 election , in which he said , “The real reason , of course , why the government does not want to hold a referendum is the fear that it may lose.. . 
Nothing will do more damage to the pro-European movement than giving room to the suspicion that we have something to hide , that we do not have the ‘cojones’ to carry out our argument to the people.” <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The use of the word “cojones” - not wide-spread in [LOC Britain  ] as it is in the [LOC U.S.  ] - came back to bite [PER Clegg  ] in the , er , nether regions at the March 5 session of Prime Minister’s Questions . 
Rising to address the [ORG Commons  ] , [PER Clegg  ] nervously shook a crease out of his trousers , unwittingly bringing the cojones remark back to the fore and causing the [ORG House of Commons  ] to erupt in jeers and laughter , drowning out Clegg’s question and forcing the Speaker of the [ORG House  ] to call for order . 
[MISC Tory  ] Foreign Affairs Spokesman [PER William Hague  ] raised the subject yet again in the debate on the [ORG Lisbon Treaty  ] referendum later that day. “Any explanation of why [LOC LONDON  ] 00000732 002 OF 003 the [ORG Liberal Democrat  ] leadership’s protests in the debates have become ever more shrill , ” [PER Hague  ] said , “is that , at some point in recent months , they have become separated from their cojones . 
Those unfortunate objects are now to be found impaled on a distant fence.” More jeers and laughter followed. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) Difficult as it is to imagine , the situation got worse for [PER Clegg  ] after that . 
In the ensuing vote on the [ORG Conservative  ] referendum motion , 13 out of the 63 [ORG Lib Dem  ] MPs , including three members of Clegg’s cabinet , broke from the official party line to vote in favor of a referendum on the [ORG Lisbon Treaty  ] , on the grounds that abstention was not in keeping with the party’s 2005 election manifesto . 
The dissenting cabinet members - Environment Spokesman [PER Tim Farron  ] , [LOC Scotland  ] and [LOC Northern Ireland  ] Spokesman [PER Alistair Carmichael  ] , and Justice Spokesman [PER David Heath  ] - subsequently resigned their front bench positions . 
According to [PER Michael Moore  ] , the [ORG Lib Dem  ] rebels all hold their seats by narrow margins and believe that abstention might hurt their chances of reelection . 
[PER Moore  ] took on the [LOC Scotland  ] and [LOC Northern Ireland  ] portfolio when [PER Carmichael  ] resigned , but indicated to us that the three front benchers will eventually return to their positions after a decent interval . 
On the idea of allowing a free vote on the referendum , as some parliament watchers had suggested , [PER Moore  ] said even more [ORG Lib Dems  ] MPs would have gone against the party line if [PER Clegg  ] hadn’t attempted to impose discipline. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The press ate [PER Clegg  ] alive. “No [PER Cojones Clegg”  ] ran the headline from the [ORG Independent.  ] “Calamity Clegg’s Spectacular Blunder , ” ran the [ORG Daily Mail.  ] “Since their angry ‘mince-out’ , most MPs have decided the [ORG Lib Dems  ] are a joke , ” the [MISC Guardian  ] proclaimed . 
[PER Clegg  ] “castrated himself in full view of the [ORG House of Commons  ] , ” declared columnist [PER Matt Norton  ] in the Independent . 
Speech Rallies The Troops ------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Clegg  ] went into the spring conference shaken by the events of the previous two days , but managed to deliver a strong key note speech that went some way toward repairing the damage . 
Speaking without notes , he called for a shake-up of the entire [MISC British  ] political system , including a constitutional convention to examine all aspects of how [LOC Britain  ] is governed , firing MPs who break parliamentary ethics rules , and limiting political donations . 
He also addressed head on the idea of a possible coalition with either the [ORG Labour  ] or [ORG Conservative  ] parties in the event of a hung parliament , vowing , “I will never allow the [ORG Liberal Democrats  ] to be a mere annex to another party.” His wording , however , implied that the [ORG Lib Dems  ] would consider a coalition if their own concerns were taken into account . 
The [ORG BBC  ] called the speech “an impassioned plea for change , ” while the [MISC Guardian  ] said the speech demonstrates that [PER Clegg  ] “has the resilience to hit back.” <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) Conference organizers told us beforehand that the [ORG Lisbon Treaty  ] would be kept deliberately off the agenda in anticipation that the issue would blow up - as it did in the [ORG Commons  ] . 
The blow-up , however , produced worry and head-scratching among the party rank-and-file at the Conference rather than attacks on [PER Clegg  ] . 
As one conference attendee put it to us , “I know something bad happened , but I’m not sure what . 
I don’t really understand what the whole thing is about.” “We’ve Got To Make This One [MISC Stick”  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C/NF ) The March 5 disaster notwithstanding , [ORG Lib Dem  ] party members appear happy with Clegg’s performance so far . 
Some noted to us , however , that he has spent most of his time since becoming leader in December 2007 working the political crowd in [LOC Westminster  ] , and has not reached out to the party rank and file . 
All of our [ORG MP  ] and party member contacts tell us they recognize that [PER Clegg  ] , who only entered Parliament in 2005 , faces a steep learning curve. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C/NF ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] says that so far [PER Clegg  ] has been decisive and thoughtful . 
In contrast , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , former leader [PER Sir Menzies  ] “Ming” [PER Campbell  ] was more like a chairman of the board , a style not in keeping with the way the unruly party actually operates . 
For example , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , [PER Campbell  ] would give directives while not understanding that the organizational structure to impose his edicts did not exist. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C/NF ) [ORG Shadow Housing Minister  ] [PER Lembit Opik  ] has a different view of [PER Clegg  ] . 
In [LOC Opik’s  ] view , [PER Clegg  ] has [LOC LONDON  ] 00000732 003 OF 003 surrounded himself with insiders who carry out his wishes without consulting others , thus allowing [PER Clegg  ] to avoid direct confrontation , a trait some party members have pointed out to us as one of his failings ( reftel ) . 
According to [PER Opik  ] , Clegg’s thin skin also showed itself during the lead-up to the March 5 fiasco , when [PER Clegg  ] derided one of [LOC Opik’s  ] suggestions in front of the [ORG Lib Dem  ] cabinet , then adopted it without telling [PER Opik  ] . 
When [PER Opik  ] confronted [PER Clegg  ] about it , [PER Opik  ] says he was immediately whisked away by a [PER Clegg  ] crony who begged him not to make a scene in public . 
[PER Opik  ] told us he plans to run for [ORG Lib Dem  ] President ( a leadership role , but subordinate to [PER Clegg  ] ) at the end of the year to give the [ORG Lib Dems  ] an alternate voice inside the party. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C/NF ) No matter how [PER Clegg  ] ultimately performs , however , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us frankly that , as the third [ORG Lib Dem  ] leader in two years , the party has no choice but to make sure he succeeds. “We’ve got to make this one stick , ” he said . 
[PER Moore  ] and [ORG Shadow Home Affairs  ] Spokesman [PER Jeremy Brown  ] affirmed to us that there are no alternative leadership candidates to [PER Clegg  ] . 
Comment ------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C/NF ) One commentator compared the [ORG Lib Dem  ] performance on the [ORG Lisbon Treaty  ] referendum to watching a “car crash in slow motion.” One could apply that metaphor to the entire last three years , beginning in December 2005 when [PER Charles Kennedy  ] was forced to stand down as leader for alcoholism . 
There is no question that the [ORG Lib Dems  ] were badly hurt by their handling of the [ORG Lisbon Treaty  ] referendum , although Clegg’s performance at conference appears to have undone some of the damage . 
And they continue to be worth watching - and not just because the horror of it makes great copy . 
Despite its ups and downs , the party continues to poll between 15 and 20 percent of the electorate . 
With [ORG Labour  ] at about 33 percent and the [MISC Tories  ] at about 40 percent , [PER Nick Clegg  ] could yet be a “kingmaker” in the event of a hung parliament at the next election .
