( U ) SUMMARY . 
[MISC Afghan  ] officials , including the [MISC Afghan  ] Chief Justice , the Attorney General , the Minister of Interior , and the Minister of Justice agree 24-hour security for certain at-risk judges and prosecutors is needed to establish a judiciary capable of prosecuting the powerful criminals and corrupt officials who are destabilizing [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The [MISC Afghan  ] government has agreed to work with the [LOC United States  ] , the [LOC UK  ] ( a strong supporter ) , and other partners to recruit , train , and equip a specialized judicial security unit ( [ORG JSU  ] ) modeled on the [ORG U.S. Marshals Service  ] . 
A technical committee has met several times to discuss how to stand up such a force . 
On September 28 , [PER CSTC-A  ] agreed to help identify a training and billeting facility , and provide [ORG JSU  ] officers from the build-up of ANP forces . 
Additional funding resources , however , will be required to proceed . 
End Summary. -------------------------------------- BACKGROUND: NEED FOR JUDICIAL SECURITY -------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) The fear of assassination prevents many ( if not most ) [MISC Afghan  ] judges and prosecutors from carrying out their duties with objectivity , particularly in cases involving powerful criminals or well-connected corrupt officials . 
Their fear is well-founded: the justice minister in [LOC Kunduz  ] province was killed by an IED attack in late August ( the [MISC Taliban  ] claimed credit ) . 
In the past six months , insurgents killed eight prosecutors and kidnapped four others . 
The Chief Appellate Judge of the [ORG Central Narcotics Tribunal  ] was killed in September 2008 . 
Hence , [MISC Afghan  ] and international experts agree [MISC Afghan  ] judges and prosecutors need increased protection in order to establish an independent judiciary capable of prosecuting criminal and corrupt actors. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Since 2006 , the [ORG U.S. Marshals Service  ] ( [ORG USMS  ] ) has been involved in the assessment and improvement of security for the [ORG Counter-Narcotics Justice Task Force  ] ( [ORG CJTF  ] ) in [LOC Kabul  ] . 
However , because of lack of funding , the [ORG USMS  ] mandate was limited to training a small unit of the [ORG Counter Narcotics Police of Afghanistan  ] ( [ORG CNPA  ] ) to provide courtroom security . 
Following the assassination of the Chief Appellate Judge of the [ORG Central Narcotics Tribunal  ] , judicial security became an urgent priority , and the [ORG USMS  ] modified its mission to include training in personal security for key personnel . 
In a meeting with [ORG CJTF  ] personnel shortly after the assassination , the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] ( [ORG MOI  ] ) promised to create a judicial security program . 
The [ORG MOI  ] also promised to increase the number of slots allotted to the [ORG CNPA  ] unit , now called the [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Marshals Service  ] ( [ORG AMS  ] ) , and the tashkil was increased from 28 to 74 . 
Currently , however , only 47 men and women are in the unit. ---------------------------------- AFGHANS AGREE TO JUDICIAL SECURITY ---------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) Civilian and military elements have had a number of discussions in recent weeks on the need [MISC Afghan  ] officials see to develop a better way to provide better judicial security. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) The Deputy Ambassador , [LOC U.S.  ] Senator [PER Lindsey Graham  ] of [LOC South Carolina  ] , and the [ORG Rule of Law Coordinator  ] met on August 23 , 2009 with [MISC Afghan  ] Chief Justice [PER Abdul Salaam Azimi  ] , and separately with [MISC Afghan  ] Attorney General [PER Mohammed Shaq Aloko  ] , to discuss expanding judicial security . 
When that [LOC U.S.  ] delegation met with [MISC Afghan  ] Interior Minister [PER Mohammed Hanif  ] Atmar August 25 , the [MISC Afghan  ] officials acknowledged the importance and urgency of the issue . 
On August 26 , they jointly agreed to seek [LOC U.S.  ] assistance to form a special unit to protect [MISC Afghan  ] judges and prosecutors. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) On August 27 , 2009 , a [MISC Kabul-based  ] team ( including representatives from [ORG Rule of Law  ] ( [ORG ROL  ] ) , [ORG Department of Justice  ] ( [ORG DOJ  ] ) , [ORG Federal Bureau of Investigation  ] ( [ORG FBI  ] ) , [ORG USMS  ] , [ORG Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement  ] ( [ORG INL  ] ) , [ORG CSTC-A  ] , [ORG USFOR-A  ] , and [ORG CENTCOM  ] ) , met with [MISC Afghan  ] Justice Minister [PER Sanwar Danish  ] , [ORG MOI  ] Deputy Minister [PER Mangal  ] , [ORG Supreme Court General Chief  ] Administrator [PER Halimi  ] , and Deputy Attorney General Fatah to discuss the way forward . 
A technical committee composed of [MISC Afghan  ] , [LOC U.S.  ] , and [LOC UK  ] officials subsequently met to examine the details of the [ORG JSU  ] plan . 
The committee agreed to draft a concept paper addressing recruiting , training , equipping , and funding a judicial security unit . 
The committee will also explore the possibility of creating secure housing compounds for judges and prosecutors , as was done in [LOC Baghdad.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) During the discussions , the [MISC Afghan  ] side proposed a nationwide force of up to 7,411 personnel at an estimated cost of $43 million ( the [LOC U.S.  ] and international donors would need to provide this assistance ) . 
Deputy Interior Minister [PER Mangal  ] offered 100 police officers , starting in September 2009 , to meet the short-term needs of the proposed [ORG Justice Security Unit  ] ( [ORG JSU  ] ) . 
The [ORG JSU  ] would protect judges at the [ORG Counter Narcotics Justice Center  ] , the [ORG Supreme Court  ] , and judges handling [ORG Anti-Corruption Unit  ] and [ORG Major Crimes Task Force  ] cases . 
In addition , the [MISC Afghan  ] side proposed including protection [LOC KABUL  ] 00003185 002 OF 002 for ministry officials and juvenile detention centers. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) The [LOC U.S.  ] delegation proposed to train the [ORG JSU  ] to provide courtroom and personal security for judges and prosecutors , and to apprehend fugitives . 
They made clear that [LOC U.S.  ] funding would need to be tied to compliance with the implementation plan . 
To support development of a plan , the [ORG USMS  ] recently conducted a security assessment of the needs of the [ORG Supreme Court.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) At a meeting on September 26 , DM [PER Mangal  ] , and [ORG DOJ  ] and [ORG USMS  ] officials discussed the need to replicate the training given to the security force at the [ORG CNJC  ] for the entire proposed national [ORG JSU  ] . 
Deputy Minister [PER Mangal  ] agreed to revise the structure of the [ORG MOI  ] to place the [ORG JSU  ] , now part of the [ORG CNPA  ] , under the direct supervision of DM [PER Mangal  ] . 
This step would encourage use of the existing [ORG JSU  ] as a model for the development of the larger , nationwide [ORG JSU  ] envisioned by the [MISC Afghan  ] government. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) Subsequently , [ORG Technical Operations Division Assistant Director  ] [PER William Snelson  ] and [ORG Commander Special Operations Group  ] [PER David Robertson  ] , [ORG U.S. Marshals Service  ] ( [ORG USMS  ] ) , met with [ORG COL Scott Jones  ] , [ORG CSTC-A  ] Deputy Assistant Commanding General for Police Development , and [ORG COL  ] [PER Louis Jordan  ] , [ORG CSTC-A Senior Military Advisor  ] to the Deputy Minister of the Interior for [MISC Counter-Narcotics  ] , September 28 , 2009 to how the [LOC U.S.  ] military can support standing up an [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Judicial Security Unit  ] ( [ORG JSU  ] ) modeled on the [ORG USMS  ] . 
[ORG CSTC-A  ] pledged to help locate a training facility for the [ORG JSU  ] program . 
In addition , [ORG COL Jones  ] said the [ORG JSU  ] force will come from the over-all planned build-up of the [ORG Afghan National Police  ] . 
[ORG CSTC-A  ] asked the [ORG U.S. Marshal Service  ] to provide subject matter expertise in developing the force structure of the unit , which [ORG USMS  ] agreed to do . 
Both [ORG CSTC-A  ] and [ORG USMS  ] agreed the 7,411 person security element is excessive. ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Post strongly supports the proposal to build the [ORG JSU  ] into an effective security unit to protect judges and prosecutors . 
However , we note the difficulty of obtaining adequate funding and sufficient numbers of [ORG U.S. Marshals Service  ] personnel to oversee training of the unit . 
We are encouraged by the support pledged by [ORG CSTC-A  ] to locate and develop a training facility. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Under the best of circumstances , providing security to judges in the provinces is years away . 
Our sense is that protection should first be provided to justices of the [ORG U.S.-funded Counter Narcotics Justice Center  ] , then to [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Supreme Court Justices  ] , then to at-risk judges in [LOC Kabul  ] , and then to at-risk judges in key provinces . 
The [ORG JSU  ] will only protect prosecutors under specific threat , as in the [LOC United States.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Afghan  ] government officials agree -- and we agree -- that the country 's judiciary and progress on rule of law would benefit from creation of a judicial security unit . 
At the same time , discussion of key points , including the size of the program and the budget it would need , have yet to begin in a detailed way . 
Embassy and potential [MISC Afghan  ] partners are meeting to develop the thinking further and will provide [LOC Washington  ] with updates , and at the appropriate time requests for action , as the work here proceeds .
