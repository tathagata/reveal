Stapleton  ] , for reasons 1.5 ( b ) and ( d ) SUMMARY --------------------------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Mr. President , you will arrive in [LOC France  ] as [PER Nicolas Sarkozy  ] begins the second year of a five-year term as President . 
You will meet a [PER Sarkozy  ] chastened by the experience of a first year marked by a sharp drop in his political stock at home , but during which he nevertheless reclaimed [MISC French  ] leadership in [LOC Europe  ] and moved [LOC France  ] closer to the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Sarkozy  ] was elected in May 2007 on a platform of fundamental domestic reform , promising to unleash [MISC France’s  ] economic potential and to adapt the country to globalization . 
He has undertaken a range of domestic reforms but the results have been somewhat disappointing -- to supporters who advocated more daring implementation of a more ambitious set of measures , and to a public that expected an immediate positive impact in household purchasing power . 
Though the public by and large continues to support Sarkozy’s reform effort , his personal popularity has plummeted , mostly as a result of his “unpresidential” parading of his personal life and his weakness for glitz -- an image he is now seeking to repair. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Sarkozy  ] was not elected on a foreign policy platform , but this is where he has thus far left his clearest mark , repositioning [LOC France  ] to work alongside the [LOC U.S.  ] to meet common challenges and leading [LOC Europe  ] to its next institutional advance in the form of the [ORG Lisbon Treaty  ] . 
While stressing [MISC France’s  ] independence of action , [PER Sarkozy  ] has sought to enlarge [MISC French  ] influence by working constructively with the [LOC U.S.  ] , setting aside [MISC France’s Gaullist  ] vocation of tempering the [LOC United States’  ] “hegemonic” position in world affairs . 
This “repositioning” ( Sarkozy’s term ) vis-a- vis the [LOC U.S.  ] is seen most clearly in Sarkozy’s articulation of the stakes for [LOC France  ] , [ORG NATO  ] and the [LOC West  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , his commitment of more troops to [MISC NATO’s  ] stabilization efforts there , and his declared intention to re-join [MISC NATO’s  ] integrated military command structure in the context of an invigorated [MISC European  ] effort on defense . 
Your visit provides an opportunity to support and give further impetus to Sarkozy’s refashioning of the [MISC U.S.-French  ] relationship , and to demonstrate to the [MISC French  ] public that [PER Sarkozy  ] was right in positing that a closer relationship with us increases [MISC France’s  ] influence without undermining its independence . 
A discussion of [MISC France’s  ] approach to key international issues closes out this message . 
END SUMMARY . 
[LOC SARKOZY’S  ] LEADERSHIP: [LOC FRANCE  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) It remains to be seen if [PER Nicolas Sarkozy  ] will prove able to reform [LOC France  ] economically and socially , unleash its competitive potential , and help it embrace globalization . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] was elected president in May 2007 on a wave of public recognition of the need for such change and enthusiasm for [PER Sarkozy  ] as the person to bring it about . 
After a year in office [PER Sarkozy  ] has undertaken many of the across-the-board reforms he promised , but the effect -- particularly with regard to the critical issue of purchasing power -- has yet to be felt by the [MISC French  ] public . 
Widespread disappointment with the meager results of reform , along with dismay at [LOC Sarkozy’s  ] penchant for a flashy , “unpresidential” lifestyle , has driven down [ORG Sarkozy’s  ] approval ratings , now stuck below forty percent . 
Notwithstanding his personal unpopularity , Sarkozy’s reform policies still enjoy broad public support . 
It remains to be seen if he can summon sufficient authority to implement a package of reforms that will produce the desired impact by the end of his term . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] believes he can: You will be meeting an embattled , but determined president , who remains primarily focused on delivering what he promised in his campaign -- modernizing and economically liberating [LOC France  ] -- and who is determined to succeed , deploying the considerable , largely unchecked powers of the [MISC French  ] [ORG Presidency.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Sarkozy’s first year in office is the story of how a spectacularly successful presidential candidacy gave way to a [LOC PARIS  ] 00000957 002.2 OF 008 spectacularly unpopular presidency . 
The collusion and antagonism between [PER Sarkozy  ] and the media are key , persistent themes of this story . 
For the first six months of his administration ( May - October ) [PER Sarkozy  ] enjoyed the longest political honeymoon and best polls of any [MISC French  ] Presidency on record . 
He dominated the [MISC French  ] political landscape , personally driving all government policies and setting the tone for the media’s coverage of his national and international presidential activities . 
Then ( from November through February ) , in a major miscalculation in image management , [PER Sarkozy  ] paraded for media coverage his billonaire-life-style affair with former supermodel and current First [PER Lady Carla Bruni-Tedeschi  ] , whom he married within weeks of meeting her following his divorce from his second wife , [PER Cecelia Sarkozy  ] . 
The media that he had drawn in to project himself as a hyper-energetic , no-nonsense reformer dedicated to solving the problems of ordinary [MISC French  ] people , took its vengeance , portraying [PER Sarkozy  ] as a vulgar , insecure celebrity-worshipper focused only on himself and his place in the limelight . 
The ensuing , widespread sense among the public that [PER Sarkozy  ] didn’t really care about the problems of ordinary people sent the president’s popularity plummeting . 
( His cause was not helped either by the embarrassing week-long visit to [LOC Paris  ] last fall by [MISC Libyan  ] leader [PER Qadhafi  ] , whose pronouncements and antics chipped away the notion that Sarkozy’s approach to such leaders and to human rights issues would be markedly different from his predecessor’s -- and contrasted sharply with Sarkozy’s earlier public pronouncements . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Since March [PER Sarkozy  ] has sought to reassure his partisans and the country that he remains committed to reform , despite setbacks , and that he has drawn appropriate conclusions concerning the visibility of his private life . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] re-fashioned his image , hewing somewhat more closely to public expectations for [MISC French  ] presidents as soberly distant , near-regal figures who officiate at civic rituals . 
This return of a more traditional presidency has coincided with Prime Minister Fillon’s emergence from under the shadow of [PER Sarkozy  ] as a national leader in his own right and of the [ORG Fillon  ] government’s ministers finding firmer footing as policymakers and implementers of reform . 
In a prime-time television appearance in April , [PER Sarkozy  ] re-launched reform , promising his continued , personal engagement . 
However , any return to the political dominance [PER Sarkozy  ] once enjoyed will be very difficult , will take time , and will depend largely on showing results -- reforms that enhance the prosperity and opportunities of ordinary citizens . 
In sum , his first year in office has highlighted three Sarkozys who will likely continue to co-exist through the end of his term: the hyper-activist reformer and commanding political figure , the self-absorbed and frenetic individual , and the statesman , matured by the exigencies and burdens of office , who perseveres to achieve his leadership vision . 
SARKOZY’S LEADERSHIP: [MISC U.S.-FRANCE  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [LOC France  ] remains a world power and a leader of [LOC Europe  ] . 
With global military and diplomatic reach , it generates significant economic wealth and still enjoys envied cultural prestige . 
Even though he was not elected on a foreign policy platform , Sarkozy’s most significant achievement thus far is his re-positioning of [LOC France  ] to work alongside the [LOC U.S.  ] to solve problems , removing the [MISC Gaullist  ] imperative of keeping a critical distance from [LOC Washington  ] . 
From the outset of his presidency , [PER Sarkozy  ] was intent on improving relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] and , more broadly , bringing [LOC France  ] back -- as he put it in a key foreign policy address -- to full membership in the “the [MISC West’s  ] family” of democratic nations . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] considers the re-positioning of [LOC France  ] alongside the [LOC U.S.  ] -- no longer advocating alternative poles to [MISC American  ] leadership -- will increase [MISC France’s  ] influence as we together address the grave challenges facing the international order . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] identifies those challenges as religion-based political extremism , nuclear proliferation , non-inclusion of the world’s poor in economic integration , and environmental catastrophe . 
In addition , he sees bringing [LOC France  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] together as historically fitting and proper . 
This stems [LOC PARIS  ] 00000957 003.2 OF 008 both from Sarkozy’s full appreciation of the significance for [LOC France  ] of liberation from [MISC Nazi  ] occupation in [MISC World War II  ] and from his personal identification with [MISC American  ] social values , in particular , individual opportunity and achievement. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Sarkozy’s leadership in reinvigorating the bilateral relationship was marked both by powerfully symbolic gestures and concrete actions . 
Sarkozy’s trips to the [LOC U.S.  ] , including a vacation in [LOC New Hampshire  ] last August and an official visit in November , clearly signaled the renewal of trust and friendship between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC France  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] said , in the opening of his November 7 speech before a joint session of [ORG Congress  ] , “Friendship , first and foremost means being true to one’s friends” and [LOC France  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] are friends that “have always stood side by side , supported one another , helped one another , fought for one another’s freedom.” Figuring prominently among Sarkozy’s gestures that signaled a new [MISC French  ] understanding of key [LOC U.S.  ] policies were the dispatch , after your meeting with him in [LOC Kennebunkport  ] , of his foreign minister to [LOC Iraq  ] and his own [MISC Christmas  ] Eve visit to [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) At the [LOC Bucharest Summit  ] , when you last met with him , [PER Sarkozy  ] repeated his intention to “renovate” [MISC France’s  ] relationship with [ORG NATO  ] and to increase its commitment of troops under [ORG NATO  ] command in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
He was vague , however , as to the exact timing of [ORG NATO  ] re-integration , and he understated the size of the [MISC French  ] reinforcement for [LOC Afghanistan  ] , announcing only the 700-person battalion that will be sent to [MISC RC-East  ] . 
He did not publicly mention the additional 300-350 troops [LOC France  ] will send to [LOC Kabul  ] in July when it assumes RC-Capital command there ( or the possibility of dispatching special operations forces sometime later ) . 
Sarkozy’s public caution on [ORG NATO  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] reflects his sensitivity to recent criticism that he is aligning [LOC France  ] across the board with the [LOC U.S.  ] It also demonstrates how his current unpopularity has weakened his ability to brave the opprobrium of the [MISC Gaullist  ] conservatives , including many in his own administration . 
Sarkozy’s commitment to a more Altanticist [LOC France  ] is not in question . 
But he does have to factor in the political caution of many around him ( including Prime Minister [ORG Fillon  ] ) and the continuing strength of the [MISC Gaullist  ] consensus among the public at large . 
Finally , a largely powerless Socialist Party-led opposition has found a voice criticizing [PER Sarkozy  ] over [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [ORG NATO  ] , even if it does not have the political muscle to throw him off course . 
WHAT WE CAN DO FOR HIM ------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) You and [PER Sarkozy  ] have brought about an important shift on the world scene: [LOC France  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] are acting together in a way they were not before his election on May 6 , 2007 . 
Giving [PER Sarkozy  ] full credit for his leadership and bolstering his stature as a world leader of vision and consequence , would be the best way to solidify [MISC France’s  ] new orientation . 
We have sought [MISC French  ] Government support on a range of issues over the year since [PER Sarkozy  ] became President . 
The [MISC French  ] have responded more positively than in the past , consistent with the [MISC Sarkozy-directed  ] shift to a closer and more harmonious working relationship . 
Your visit would be the best opportunity to show the [MISC French  ] we value that relationship and wish to build on it in such a way that it serves our collective and individual interests . 
Your praise of [MISC France’s  ] efforts to improve the relationship will have greatest impact if it is coupled with an acknowledgment of its legitimate role in the resolution of the issues that matter most to the [MISC French  ] -- beginning with [LOC Lebanon  ] , [MISC Palestinian-Israeli  ] peace , [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
The greater the specificity in describing a [MISC French  ] role , the greater the impact . 
This would also be an opportunity to express your support for Sarkozy’s vision of an effective [LOC Europe  ] , as you did in [LOC Bucharest  ] , by endorsing the further development of the [MISC EU’s  ] defense capabilities alongside [ORG NATO  ] -- demonstrating that closeness to the [LOC U.S.  ] and sensitivity to [LOC U.S.  ] priorities pay off and result in more , not less , influence for [LOC France  ] . 
FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES [LOC PARIS  ] 00000957 004.2 OF 008 ------------------------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) Discussion follows of [MISC France’s  ] approach to key international issues and how the visit might be used to advance our bilateral cooperation toward the achievement of our policy objectives. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S/NF ) [MISC IRAN:  ] The [MISC French  ] are the most tough-minded of our allies , and [PER Sarkozy  ] has more than erased the doubt in [MISC France’s  ] position stemming from Chirac’s ill-advised public equanimity about a likely [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear capability . 
Sarkozy’s hard line has negatively impacted on [MISC France’s  ] bilateral relationship with [LOC Tehran  ] , and [LOC France  ] has paid a commercial price , although the [MISC Iranians  ] , more than the [MISC French  ] , are the ones seeking to preserve some sort of discreet channel between [LOC Paris  ] and [LOC Tehran  ] . 
[LOC France  ] has hammered away at other [ORG EU  ] countries concerned about protecting their economic interests to implement measures to enforce [ORG UN  ] sanctions and complementary [ORG EU  ] sanctions . 
Despite the overall positive [MISC French  ] position on [LOC Iran  ] , they were very upset over what they considered our maladroit handling of the release of the [ORG NIE  ] last fall on [ORG Iran’s  ] nuclear program . 
This , in their view , greatly complicated the [MISC P-5  ] plus 1’s efforts to pass [ORG UNSCR  ] 1803 and maintain a solid front in the face of [MISC Iranian  ] intransigence . 
The [MISC French  ] share our skepticism about [PER ElBaradei  ] and the [ORG IAEA  ] . 
Given an unchanged [MISC French  ] estimate of [ORG Iran’s  ] nuclear capabilities ( perhaps more influenced by [MISC Israel’s  ] ) , [PER Sarkozy  ] will listen carefully to your views on the way forward with [LOC Iran  ] . 
He and many other [MISC French  ] policymakers share our concerns about the regional threat [LOC Iran  ] poses in the [LOC Gulf  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] , and [LOC Lebanon.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C/NF ) NATO: President [PER Sarkozy  ] , s closest advisors have made clear that he has already made the decision for [LOC France  ] to rejoin [ORG NATO  ] , s integrated military command . 
However , he faces opposition and reluctance , including from within his own party , as many prominent [MISC French  ] policy makers cling to the self-image of an independent [LOC France  ] as symbolized by its singular position in [ORG NATO  ] . 
The grand bargain -- a full return to [ORG NATO  ] in return for a [LOC U.S.  ] embrace of an enhanced [ORG EU  ] role in [MISC European  ] defense ) is viewed as essential to make the move politically palatable to the broader [MISC French  ] public . 
For this reason , President [PER Sarkozy  ] was deeply grateful for your support at [LOC Bucharest  ] . 
[MISC French  ] officials are preparing to make [MISC European  ] defense a priority of the [ORG EU  ] presidency in the second half of this year , and are tentatively citing the 60th anniversary [ORG NATO  ] summit as the target date for a [MISC French  ] announcement on reintegration . 
As noted above , a further statement during the visit of [LOC U.S.  ] support for a strengthened [MISC European  ] defense would be welcome as [PER Sarkozy  ] seeks to move forward on [ORG NATO  ] . 
The [MISC French  ] continue to doubt [ORG Georgia’s  ] and Ukraine’s readiness for [ORG MAP  ] , but have not completely closed the door to a [ORG NATO  ] Ministerial decision granting [ORG MAP  ] to one or both of them in December. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [MISC AFGHANISTAN: At  ] the [LOC Bucharest  ] [ORG NATO  ] summit , [PER Sarkozy  ] publicly announced 700 new troops for [LOC Afghanistan  ] , a supplemental battalion for [MISC RC-East  ] . 
As noted , in July [LOC France  ] will also be adding some 300-350 troops to bolster the [MISC French  ] presence in [LOC Kabul  ] , as [LOC France  ] assumes command of RC-Central beginning this summer . 
Finally , a deployment of Special Forces may also still be on the table , although not before the July reinforcement of [MISC France’s  ] command presence in [LOC Kabul  ] . 
Although still the largest increase announced at [LOC Bucharest  ] , [PER Sarkozy  ] understated [MISC France’s  ] additional contribution in the face of rising public and political opposition . 
( Most polling shows only a minority of the [MISC French  ] public supports increased deployments to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and there is little public appreciation of the stakes involved . 
) To increase support for [LOC Afghanistan  ] , the [MISC French  ] government is co-hosting the [LOC Afghanistan  ] support conference , to take place on the eve of your visit . 
The conference will follow up on the 2006 [LOC London  ] donor , s conference and address broader questions of counter-narcotics , effective distribution of aid , good governance and anti-corruption efforts . 
Your public statements need to address the widespread perception that the international effort in [LOC Afghanistan  ] is failing and explain why success there must be a [MISC European  ] imperative . 
[LOC PARIS  ] 00000957 005.2 OF 008 <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) IRAQ: [MISC French  ] reluctance to commit military troops to [LOC Iraq  ] remains a constant , as does [MISC France’s  ] hesitation to increase bilateral assistance or engagement as long as the security situation and prospects for national reconciliation are seen as fragile . 
The [MISC French  ] have , however , begun to re-engage , opening an embassy office in the [MISC Kurdish  ] city of [LOC Irbil  ] ( which they have suggested would be used as a national center for training and assistance ) . 
FM [PER Kouchner  ] participated in the last two “neighbors” meetings as a means of encouraging [MISC Arab  ] states to shore up diplomatic and other relations with [LOC Baghdad  ] . 
[LOC France  ] staunchly backs [ORG UNAMI  ] and the idea of the [ORG UN  ] leading international reconstruction in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The [MISC French  ] have not , however , had much success achieving a significant change of view within the [ORG EU  ] and may use their upcoming presidency to push harder . 
Commercial ties are growing , but only slowly . 
The [MISC French  ] are eager to talk about [LOC Iraq  ] , but we need to do more by way of a sustained and realistic dialogue . 
[LOC Iraq  ] Coordinator [PER David Satterfield  ] started such a dialogue last December , but we should consider intensifying it and making it more of an interagency undertaking , with State and DoD in the lead . 
[MISC French  ] concerns about [ORG Iran’s  ] role in radicalizing [LOC Shi’a  ] elements in [LOC Iraq  ] and elsewhere is something we should factor into these discussions. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) LEBANON/SYRIA: They [MISC French  ] Presidency learned its lesson from its failed attempt to work with [LOC Syria  ] late last year to secure election of a new president in [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
[LOC France  ] has resisted repeated [MISC Syrian  ] appeals to resume that effort or start a new one and the [MISC French  ] have publicly blamed [LOC Syria  ] for the continued impasse . 
However , they are out of ideas as far as how best to move things forward and have adopted the public line that the only diplomatic initiative in play is the one the [ORG Arab League  ] ( with Syria’s assent ) adopted . 
The recent fighting in [LOC Lebanon  ] saw the [MISC French  ] at once eager to work with us but determined to seek as a priority the minimum necessary to calm the situation and resume dialogue among the parties ; the safety of their [ORG UNIFIL  ] contingent weighed heavily in their policy deliberations . 
The current crisis has underscored a key divergence in the [MISC French  ] approach from ours , i.e. , the degree to which it supports the majority March 14 movement as well as the [MISC Lebanese  ] government . 
Repeatedly , the [MISC French  ] have asserted that they support the government led by PM Siniora but do not accept that the movement behind him , which they see as one unstable faction among many , deserves the same full support . 
Maintaining a channel to [ORG Hizballah  ] , which [PER Sarkozy  ] and [PER Kouchner  ] have called a terrorist organization despite [MISC French  ] reluctance to designate it as such , is another reason the [MISC French  ] refuse to “take sides” in a way that would put pressure on [ORG Hizballah  ] despite their firm view that March 8 and the [MISC Syrians  ] are responsible for Lebanon’s political stalemate . 
Despite frequent tactical disagreements at the [ORG UN  ] , we and the [MISC French  ] largely share the same view that it is vital that the [ORG UN  ] investigation into the many political assassinations in [LOC Lebanon  ] lead as rapidly as possible to indictments and prosecution . 
Your visit offers an important opportunity for policy coordination. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [MISC ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN PEACE:  ] As always , [LOC France  ] remains eager to play an important role in bringing peace between [LOC Israel  ] and the [MISC Palestinians  ] . 
Under [PER Sarkozy  ] , the [MISC French  ] needling of the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Israel  ] has largely disappeared from the government’s daily script . 
The [MISC French  ] hope that Sarkozy’s warm embrace of [LOC Israel  ] ( unprecedented over the past fifty years ) , and his strategic rapprochement with the [LOC U.S.  ] , have increased its credibility as a partner in peace-making . 
It was in this context that the [MISC French  ] offered to follow up the [LOC Annapolis  ] conference with a donors conference in [LOC Paris  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] , who is an unabashed admirer of [LOC Israel  ] but keen that [MISC Palestinians  ] are treated justly , will listen carefully to what you have to tell him about your recent visit to the region and how his own [LOC Middle East  ] trip at the end of June can reinforce your message to the parties. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) KOSOVO: [LOC France  ] recognized [LOC Kosovo  ] , s independence immediately , but is hesitant about full implementation due to the potentially destabilizing role of [LOC Serbia  ] ( and [LOC Russia  ] ) in [LOC PARIS  ] 00000957 006.2 OF 008 the region . 
It is important to reassure [PER Sarkozy  ] that , while we must proceed with full implementation of the [MISC Ahtisaari  ] plan , we agree with [LOC France  ] on the importance of [LOC Serbia  ] in maintaining regional stability , and that [LOC U.S.  ] policies will remain consistent with our vision for [MISC Euro-Atlantic  ] integration of the entire [LOC Western Balkans  ] , including both [LOC Serbia  ] and [LOC Kosovo.  ] <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [ORG EU  ] PRESIDENCY: [LOC France  ] will chair the [ORG European Union  ] from July to December 2008 . 
As President of the [ORG European Council  ] , [PER Sarkozy  ] will be the most visible face of the [ORG EU  ] and will have a major opportunity to advance [MISC French  ] policy priorities . 
Sarkozy’s goals for [MISC France’s  ] presidency include strengthening [MISC European  ] Security and [ORG Defense Policy  ] ( [ORG ESDP  ] ) , in which he will seek to increase [MISC European  ] defense capabilities in parallel with normalizing [MISC France’s  ] role in [ORG NATO  ] . 
Sarkozy’s other priorities include building a [MISC European  ] consensus on energy and environment , immigration , and agricultural policy , as well as developing the [ORG Union  ] for the [MISC Mediterranean  ] . 
[LOC France  ] seeks to create a comprehensive , cohesive [MISC European  ] energy policy , promoting energy security along with environmental aims such as reduction of greenhouse gases and promotion of renewable energies . 
Similarly , a common [MISC European  ] pact on immigration would help [ORG EU  ] member-states present a consistent front to those seeking asylum or immigrant visas . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] also wants to set the stage for a revision of the [ORG EU  ] Common Agricultural Policy , which provides [MISC French  ] farmers with important subsidies . 
The [MISC French  ] [ORG EU  ] presidency will also inherit ongoing initiatives , such as the internal process of ratification of the [LOC Treaty of Lisbon  ] , or simplified [ORG EU  ] treaty , for which [PER Sarkozy  ] takes credit . 
[LOC France  ] will also during its presidency help shape [ORG EU  ] responses to crises or other foreign policy issues that may emerge . 
The presidency will thus raise Sarkozy’s global visibility , increase his influence , and give him an opportunity to improve his image as a statesman both overseas and domestically . 
We enjoy good communication with the [MISC French  ] on their [ORG EU  ] presidency preparations , and such openness will remain key during their presidency . 
Transparency regarding defense capabilities is particularly important as we seek , with other [ORG NATO  ] allies , to ensure that [ORG ESDP  ] development is carried out in harmony with [ORG NATO  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] continues to oppose Turkey’s entry into the [ORG EU  ] , in line with [MISC French  ] public opinion , but he has not sought to bring the issue to a head . 
[LOC France  ] will seek to use its influence as [ORG EU  ] President to break through the [MISC Turkey-Cyprus  ] impasse on [MISC NATO/EU  ] cooperation. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) [ORG UNION  ] FOR THE MEDITERRANEAN: This new organization , Sarkozy’s brainchild , will be established at a [LOC Paris  ] summit meeting on July 13 . 
Built on existing cooperative structures , it is intended to bring the [ORG EU  ] member-states together with countries from around the [MISC Mediterranean  ] basin to work on concrete economic , environmental and infrastructure projects . 
The focus on specific projects is likely to be a productive approach , for which we can signal our interest and support . 
Though the [LOC U.S.  ] would not be eligible , nor seek to join the [ORG Union  ] for the [MISC Mediterranean  ] , we could eventually participate in specific projects or work in tandem with them . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] significantly revised his initial vision for the [ORG Union  ] to allay the concerns of [LOC Germany  ] and other [MISC European  ] partners that a new cooperative body could split or otherwise weaken the [ORG EU  ] . 
The linkage of the [ORG Union  ] for the [MISC Mediterranean  ] to pre-existing structures that have by most accounts proven ineffective , coupled with a lack of public-sector funds for the new initiative , may mean the new organization’s impact will be less than intended. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) [MISC TERRORISM: Fighting  ] terrorism remains among the [ORG GOF  ] , s top priorities . 
[LOC France  ] is one of the few countries in [LOC Europe  ] that &gets it , 8 and remains dedicated to increasing its capabilities ) in both defense and intelligence . 
[LOC France  ] has been a target of terrorism for decades and is [ORG Al-Qaida  ] in the [MISC Islamic  ] Maghreb’s ( [ORG AQIM  ] ) number one foreign target . 
The improvement of our bilateral relationship over the past year has meant more substantive discussions on many of our common threats . 
The visit is an opportunity to signal to [PER Sarkozy  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] appreciates our increased C/T cooperation and [LOC PARIS  ] 00000957 007.2 OF 008 would like to see that collaboration expand further. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) [ORG FARC  ] HOSTAGES/BETANCOURT: [PER Sarkozy  ] raised the profile of the [PER Betancourt  ] issue during the election campaign and over the first year of his Presidency , hoping to accrue political credit for succeeding where his predecessors had failed . 
Instead he has only raised the [MISC Betancourt’s  ] value to the [ORG FARC  ] as a prisoner . 
The [MISC French  ] continue to search for possible options to negotiate a release of [MISC Franco-Colombian  ] hostage [PER Ingrid Betancourt  ] ( and other hostages ) . 
In an attempt to increase international concern over [PER Betancourt  ] , s health and possibly secure a hostage release , the [ORG French Government  ] sent a medical mission to [LOC Colombia  ] in early April . 
The [ORG FARC  ] rejected this effort , saying that any release would have to be coordinated in advance with them . 
Foreign Minister [PER Kouchner  ] visited [LOC Colombia  ] , [LOC Ecuador  ] , and [LOC Venezuela  ] at the beginning of May in an effort to find new solutions to the hostage issues ; however , [PER Kouchner  ] told journalists after his return that he is not optimistic that [PER Betancourt  ] will be released . 
The [MISC French  ] believe the [MISC Colombian  ] airstrike on March 1 which killed senior [ORG FARC  ] member [PER Paul Reyes  ] may have derailed ongoing efforts to free [PER Betancourt  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] may raise his concern that the [MISC Colombian  ] military might undertake additional operations -- that could threaten the safety of [PER Betancourt  ] -- and he may well seek your assistance in securing [MISC Betancourt’s  ] release given perceived [LOC U.S.  ] influence with President [PER Uribe.  ] <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( U ) CLIMATE CHANGE: Ninety percent of the [MISC French  ] public considers climate change as one of the gravest issues facing mankind and many still cannot understand why the [LOC U.S.  ] failed to accept the [ORG Kyoto Protocol  ] . 
When [PER Sarkozy  ] was elected President , he challenged the [LOC U.S.  ] to assume a leadership role . 
Over the past year , the [MISC French  ] have begun to appreciate our active engagement on this issue . 
Following the [LOC U.S.  ] proposal for a [MISC Major Economies Meeting  ] process to further the [ORG UN  ] climate process , the [MISC French  ] at first expressed a mixture of skepticism and interest . 
They are now fully on board , with [LOC France  ] hosting the third [MISC Major Economies Meeting  ] ( and the first to be held overseas ) in mid-April , where [PER Sarkozy  ] made a major address . 
[LOC France  ] anticipates additional productive [ORG MEM  ] sessions leading up to the summer’s Leaders Meeting . 
This does not mean that the [MISC French  ] share all [LOC U.S.  ] positions in the [ORG MEM  ] . 
For example , they thought our medium-term greenhouse gas emissions reduction target ( capping emissions at 2025 levels ) much too modest . 
[LOC France  ] will seek strong language on climate change in the upcoming [MISC G-8  ] statement , in addition to the language on climate change in the Leaders Statement under the [ORG MEM  ] process . 
This would be an opportunity to sensitize [PER Sarkozy  ] and the [ORG GOF  ] further to the seriousness and breadth of [LOC U.S.  ] efforts. <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( C ) DARFUR/AFRICA: [PER Sarkozy  ] came to office in 2007 with an ambitious agenda for [LOC Africa  ] , including an international conference on [LOC Darfur  ] that the [MISC French  ] hosted shortly after he became president . 
The [MISC French  ] have focused on stabilizing [LOC Chad  ] and the [LOC Central African Republic  ] as their response to the broader [LOC Darfur  ] problem . 
They were responsible for obtaining [MISC European  ] approval of the [MISC French-proposed  ] [ORG EU  ] peacekeeping mission in those countries , intended to complement [ORG UN  ] peacekeeping in [LOC Darfur  ] . 
The [MISC French  ] provided essential support to our Embassy in [LOC Chad  ] and to [MISC Americans  ] in-country during the rebel attacks in February 2008 . 
Concurrently , the [MISC French  ] have been working to modernize relations with [LOC Africa  ] , seeking to develop a more business-like model free of the trappings of the colonial and immediate post-colonial eras . 
Their reflexive suspicion of [LOC U.S.  ] competition in [LOC Africa  ] has diminished , especially as China’s presence and influence has increased. <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( C ) CHINA: [PER Sarkozy  ] has tried to balance domestic political pressure to take a tough stand on [MISC Chinese  ] human rights violations with competing economic interests and a strategic approach to [LOC China  ] that favors engagement , over isolation or alienation . 
He has yet to rule out boycotting the opening ceremonies of the [MISC Olympics  ] and has said that as [LOC France  ] will hold the [ORG EU  ] Presidency during the [MISC Olympics  ] he will consult with [ORG EU  ] partners on the decision . 
While [LOC France  ] [LOC PARIS  ] 00000957 008.2 OF 008 continues to support lifting the [ORG EU  ] arms embargo against [LOC China  ] , it is unlikely that it will press this issue as there is little [ORG EU  ] support , which the [MISC Tibet/Olympics  ] controversy has only further dampened. <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( C ) RUSSIA: [PER Sarkozy  ] has been decidedly pragmatic in his relations with [LOC Russia  ] , though his advisors say he enjoys a good personal rapport with Prime Minister [PER Putin  ] . 
The [PER Sarkozy  ] government has consistently been firmer than its immediate predecessor in criticizing [MISC Russian  ] international provocations ( [LOC CFE  ] , [LOC Georgia  ] ) as well as domestic human rights abuses . 
That said , [PER Sarkozy  ] continues to see his relationship with [LOC Moscow  ] through the prism of needed cooperation with [LOC Russia  ] on [LOC Iran  ] and other major international issues , and the [MISC French  ] are sensitive to the energy security concerns of [LOC Germany  ] and other [MISC European  ] partners . 
We should assure [PER Sarkozy  ] that we are equally conscious of [LOC Russia  ] , s critical role in certain areas , but stress that it is not in our collective interest to submit to deal-making with an increasingly authoritarian and unpredictable regime in [LOC Moscow.  ] <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( C ) International Economy: Elected on a platform of economic reform , President [PER Sarkozy  ] has taken steps to make [LOC France  ] , s labor market function more efficiently and to create a more auspicious policy environment for business . 
But [PER Sarkozy  ] , s economic instincts are Gaullist and populist , rather than free-market . 
While the [MISC French  ] government has generally been a helpful interlocutor during recent global financial turmoil , [PER Sarkozy  ] has blasted &financial capitalism8 and speculators , insisting on a need for the &moralization8 of capitalism . 
He has shown a willingness to defend [MISC French  ] national corporate champions , most recently letting it be known that [MISC French  ] bank [ORG Societe Generale  ] would not be for sale to foreigners in the wake of a large-scale trading scandal . 
His minister of agriculture has used the recent spike in global food prices to call for the strengthening -- not liberalization -- of administrative oversight of food markets through the [ORG EU  ] , s [ORG Common Agricultural Policy  ] . 
He speaks enthusiastically about defending [ORG EU  ] &community preferences8 and mentions the [LOC Doha  ] round only in terms of defending agricultural interests ( despite the considerable potential gains for the service-oriented [MISC French  ] economy ) . 
And he allows populist views to prevail on agricultural biotechnology by maintaining a [MISC WTO-inconsistent  ] ban on [MISC MON810  ] corn . 
The [MISC French  ] are extremely concerned about exchange rates and their competitiveness with a weak dollar . 
When Prime Minister [PER Fillon  ] visited [LOC Washington  ] in May he was fishing with FRB Chairman [PER Bernanke  ] and Secretary [PER Paulson  ] for any hints that the USG might agree to some sort of exchange rate management or intervention . 
Our message to President [PER Sarkozy  ] should underscore that reducing market distortions and maintaining open economies will be essential to meeting common economic challenges and fostering long-term growth .
