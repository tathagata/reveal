( [LOC S/NF  ] ) As promised in [LOC Reftel A  ] , FM [MISC Moratinos  ] called the [ORG Ambassador  ] back to say that he had looked into the potential [ORG Iberia-Iran Air  ] deal and that it would not happen . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] referred to the possible use of shell companies and the Foreign Minister reiterated that the deal would not happen by any means. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The [ORG Ambassador  ] also raised the demarche during a previously scheduled lunch with Vice President [PER Fernandez de la Vega  ] on November 20 . 
The Vice President said that FM [MISC Moratinos  ] had consulted with her before speaking with the [ORG Ambassador  ] and that the deal would not happen . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] again probed delicately on the possibility of the use of shell companies to shield the sale and she remained firm . 
She acknowledged that [ORG Iberia  ] did want to sell the airplanes , but she again stated that any deal with [LOC Iran  ] Air would not happen. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The [ORG Ambassador  ] is seeking a call on the Chairman of [ORG Iberia  ] on other ( commercial ) issues . 
He will use the opportunity to raise the issue briefly , but it will not be the centerpiece of the meeting. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) Comment: Barring additional information from [LOC Washington  ] , we consider this issue closed . 
The Vice President is the enforcer within the government and she and the [ORG Ambassador  ] have an excellent relationship . 
If she says the deal is off , we believe the deal is off . 
Post thanks [LOC Washington  ] for the early notification . 
It was clear from the [ORG Ambassador  ] 's first conversation that the Foreign Minister was unaware of the potential deal . 
We do not know whether the Vice President or anyone else in the government had been aware that such a deal might be in the works , but we suspect not at the senior level . 
Both the Foreign Minister and Vice President immediately recognized the difficulties such a sale by [ORG Iberia  ] could represent .
