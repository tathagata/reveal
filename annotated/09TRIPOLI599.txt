End Summary . 
2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) During a July 27 visit to [LOC Tripoli  ] , Acting A/S [PER Feltman  ] ( accompanied by Ambassador and Pol/Econ chief ) reviewed with FM-equivalent [PER Musa Kusa  ] [LOC U.S.  ] strategic goals for the [ORG NEA  ] region and specific areas for expanded bilateral engagement . 
[PER Feltman  ] opened the nearly two-hour initial interaction between the two with an overview of the priorities set out by [ORG POTUS  ] during his [LOC Cairo  ] speech , emphasizing the need to build strategic partnerships throughout the region . 
[PER Kusa  ] commented that the current positions of the [LOC U.S.  ] vis-a-vis the [MISC Arab  ] world were notably different than under the previous Administration and noted that [LOC U.S.  ] policy toward the region led to the rift in [LOC U.S.-Libya  ] relations . 
[PER Kusa  ] seized the opportunity to offer advice , explaining that the [LOC U.S.  ] must be " fair and equal " in solving the problems of the [MISC Arab  ] world . 
He said [ORG POTUS  ] should " forget about the kings " and deal directly with the people ( a clear allusion to [LOC Libya  ] 's " [LOC Jamahiriya  ] " concept of direct governance by the people ) . 
Terrorism , he warned , stems from the people 's grievances and can be controlled by shifting the mentality of the people rather than working with governments . 
3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Kusa  ] noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] must treat [LOC Libya  ] differently from other [MISC Arab  ] nations , specifying that we could not treat Colonel [PER Qadhafi  ] the same way we treat [PER Ben Ali  ] in [LOC Tunisia  ] or [PER Mubarak  ] in [LOC Egypt  ] , given his unique background and experience . 
He commented that a man of [PER Qadhafi  ] 's " caliber " could not be placed on equal footing with the King of [LOC Jordan  ] or other traditional [MISC Arab  ] rulers . 
[PER Kusa  ] stated that leaders in [LOC Egypt  ] , [LOC Algeria  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] , and [LOC Pakistan  ] could not rule without the support of their military establishments and that while [PER Qadhafi  ] had started out as a military figure , he had been able to change into a political figure . 
[PER Kusa  ] advised that a deep , correct understanding of [PER Qadhafi  ] 's visions and aspirations would be of more benefit to the [LOC U.S.  ] regionally than would engagement with other [MISC Arab  ] statesmen . 
4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Turning to bilateral issues , [PER AA/S Feltman  ] noted the [LOC U.S.  ] desire to press the relationship forward by establishing a series of dialogues on human rights , political-military relations , trade and investment , and civil-nuclear engagement . 
[PER Kusa  ] commented that the [LOC U.S.-Libya  ] relationship was at an " acceptable " level but that the pace of engagement was a point of concern . 
He reiterated the [ORG GOL  ] 's familiar refrain about the criticism it has received for its decision to give up its [ORG WMD  ] program and , in its estimation , not having been adequately compensated for that decision . 
However , he emphasized that [LOC Libya  ] had made the correct decision and had done so with awareness and conviction . 
He acknowledged that giving up [ORG WMD  ] was the safest decision for [LOC Libya  ] . 
[ORG HUMAN RIGHTS DIALOGUE  ] 5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Kusa  ] stated that the [ORG GOL  ] had no objections to engaging in the bilateral human rights dialogue , a proposal that had previously been raised by the Ambassador , but he wanted to ensure that both governments would be " on equal footing " within the conduct of that dialogue . 
Confusing the goal of the dialogue with the Congressionally-mandated annual human rights report , he suggested that the [ORG GOL  ] should be able to insert into any report on [LOC Libya  ] 's human rights situation comments on [LOC U.S.  ] [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000599 002.2 OF 003 human rights issues . 
The [ORG AA/S  ] explained that the human rights dialogue was designed to create a discreet bilateral forum for discussion on a broad range of issues , including specific cases of concern , which would be based on mutual respect . 
[PER Kusa  ] said that the [ORG GOL  ] would agree to host the initial team of experts within the dialogue framework . 
He explained that the [ORG GOL  ] did not disagree with the concept of a dialogue but was concerned about the manner in which the [LOC U.S.  ] reported on human rights issues in [LOC Libya  ] . 
[PER Kusa  ] insisted that all discussion of human rights issues should be done in diplomatic channels within the framework of the human rights dialogue and noted his disapproval of embassy attempts to collect information directly from the public ( i.e. , human rights reporting ) . 
[PER Feltman  ] urged [PER Kusa  ] to agree to a [MISC DRL-led  ] interagency visit for one-day between August 10-20 to formally launch the dialogue . 
[PER Kusa  ] asked A/S-equivalent for the [ORG MFA Americas Department Ahmed Fituri  ] to follow-up on scheduling . 
SIGNING THE [MISC HEU-LEU  ] AGREEMENT 6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Feltman  ] urged the [ORG GOL  ] to sign the [MISC HEU-LEU  ] agreements with the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia  ] as soon as possible in order to meet the September deadline for transfer of [LOC Libya  ] 's highly enriched fuel to [LOC Russia  ] and in order to remove an obstacle to future cooperation in the civilian nuclear energy field . 
[PER Kusa  ] assured the [ORG AA/S  ] that the [ORG GOL  ] had already made the decision and indicated that meeting the September deadline would not be a problem . 
SECURITY COOPERATION - [ORG TSCTP  ] and 505 END USE AGREEMENT 7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [ORG AA/S  ] explained that one way to address [LOC Libya  ] 's requests for technical assistance was via the [ORG Trans Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership  ] ( [ORG TSCTP  ] ) , clarifying that [ORG TSCTP  ] was not a multilateral organization but rather a simple funding mechanism . 
The [ORG AA/S  ] also noted the need for [ORG GOL  ] signing an end-use monitoring agreement , which the [ORG GOL  ] had been reviewing for several months in order to move forward on our military and security relationship . 
[PER Kusa  ] asked the embassy to provide additional information via [ORG Fituri  ] 's office on [ORG TSCTP  ] and to follow-up directly with [ORG Fituri  ] on the end-use monitoring agreement . 
VISAS AND EMBASSY TRIPOLI ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES 8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Highlighting that over 1000 [LOC U.S.  ] visas had been issued to [MISC Libyans  ] by the embassy since it began full non-immigrant visa services on April 2 , [PER Feltman  ] urged [PER Kusa  ] to work with us to improve the visa situation for [MISC American  ] travelers and help establish a more transparent [MISC Libyan  ] system . 
[PER Kusa  ] agreed that the visa issue needed to be addressed and assured the [ORG AA/S  ] that the [ORG GOL  ] was developing a plan to offer special processing services to [LOC U.S.  ] officials , business travelers , and technical experts . 
[PER Feltman  ] reiterated the importance of the [ORG GOL  ] 's approval of a [ORG NEC  ] site and for finalization of the deal to compensate the [ORG USG  ] for expropriated properties . 
[PER Kusa  ] advised us to follow-up with [ORG Fituri  ] . 
Trade and [ORG Investment Framework Agreement  ] 9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In response to [PER Feltman  ] 's inquiry on [ORG GOL  ] readiness to move forward on signing a Trade and [ORG Investment Framework Agreement  ] , [PER Kusa  ] stated generally that the [ORG GOL  ] was ready to develop investment opportunities and mentioned the possibility for strategic dialogue in the international arena . 
ANOTHER AU SUMMIT: FOCUS ON PEACE AND SECURITY IN AFRICA 10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Feltman  ] highlighted that [MISC African  ] issues represented an intersection of interests between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Libya  ] . 
[PER Kusa  ] said that [LOC Libya  ] was planning to host a special one-day AU Summit in [LOC Tripoli  ] on August 31 that would focus on regional crises , particularly in [LOC Darfur  ] , [LOC Somalia  ] , and [MISC Ethiopia-Eritrea  ] . 
He explained that the [ORG GOL  ] was considering extending invitations to a number of regional and [MISC European  ] leaders and ministers , and that an invitation may be forthcoming to Secretary [PER Clinton  ] . 
He highlighted that [LOC U.S.  ] participation as a regional partner would be significant . 
POSSIBLE [MISC POTUS-QADHAFI  ] MEETING AT [MISC UNGA 11  ] . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) On the possibility of a [MISC POTUS-Qadhafi  ] meeting at [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000599 003.2 OF 003 [ORG UNGA  ] , the [ORG AA/S  ] said any meeting , if it were able to be arranged , would be significantly enhanced by [ORG GOL  ] progress in the above areas , particularly on the launching of the bilateral human rights dialogue and the signing of the [MISC HEU-LEU  ] agreement , noting that those two issues would provide substance and a reason for the meeting to take place . 
[PER Feltman  ] also urged that the Leader respect [LOC U.S.  ] sensitivities during his remarks at [ORG UNGA  ] , specifically avoiding any provocative language about the events of September 11 . 
[PER Kusa  ] indicated his agreement that a potential [MISC POTUS-Qadhafi  ] meeting should be substantive , and he noted that issues for discussion from the [MISC Libyan  ] side might include counterterrorism in the [LOC Sahel  ] , the crises in [LOC Darfur  ] and [LOC Somalia  ] , and [PER Qadhafi  ] 's overall vision for [LOC Africa  ] and peace in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
OTHER ISSUES - GUANTANAMO , [LOC WESTERN SAHARA  ] 12 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In responding to [PER Feltman  ] 's assertion that the [MISC Libyan  ] side could raise any human rights concerns it had about [LOC U.S.  ] practices , [PER Kusa  ] mentioned that the embassy could work with the [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] to address any Guantanamo-related issues . 
13 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [ORG AA/S  ] noted the [LOC U.S.  ] interest in promoting greater regional cooperation and asked for [PER Kusa  ] 's thoughts on the [LOC Western Sahara  ] issue , especially how to improve relations between [LOC Algeria  ] and [LOC Morocco  ] so as to promote [ORG Maghreb  ] unity . 
[PER Kusa  ] explained that [LOC Libya  ] was trying to play a role in the situation in order to maintain the integrity of the [ORG Maghreb Union  ] . 
[LOC Libya  ] had spoken in detail with both [LOC Morocco  ] and [LOC Algeria  ] and thought the 5+5 Group may be the best negotiating forum for the issue . 
[PER Kusa  ] predicted that if the issue was not solved under [MISC Algerian  ] President [PER Bouteflika  ] , then it would not be solved . 
14 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Comment:  ] The meeting with [PER Musa Kusa  ] was positive and clearly signaled that the new administration was prepared to deal seriously with the [MISC Libyans  ] to continue the normalization process . 
The [ORG GOL  ] 's agreement to participate actively in a bilateral human rights dialogue represents a significant step forward and will create a forum to address specific cases of concern as well as to press [LOC Libya  ] to meet its international human rights commitments more broadly . 
[PER Kusa  ] clearly got the point that any potential meeting between POTUS and [PER Qadhafi  ] at [ORG UNGA  ] would be enhanced greatly by agreement to the several issues [PER Feltman  ] raised . 
He also understood the necessity of finding a way to control [PER Qadhafi  ] 's rhetoric while in [LOC New York  ] ; however , he did not promise anything on that score . 
Post will follow-up with the [ORG MFA  ] on scheduling a one-day visit by a [MISC DRL-led  ] interagency team between August 10-20 to launch the human rights dialogue ; [ORG GOL  ] 's signing of the [MISC HEU-LEU  ] agreement ; approval on [ORG TSCTP  ] ; approval of the 505 end-user agreement ; improvement of the bilateral visa situation ; [ORG TIFA  ] ; and launching a political-military dialogue .
