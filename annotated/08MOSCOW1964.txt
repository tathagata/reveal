( C ) [ORG BP  ] [LOC Russia  ] President [PER Richard Spies  ] told us July 7 that the company is pursuing a three-pronged approach of negotiations , legal action , and international pressure in its ongoing battle with [MISC Russian  ] shareholders ( [ORG AAR  ] ) over management control of [ORG TNK-BP  ] ( refs A and B ) -- a battle that , despite progress on visas , he predicted would continue . 
[ORG TNK-BP  ] VP for International Affairs [PER Shawn McCormick  ] separately told us July 7 that a negotiated resolution of the dispute would require [ORG BP  ] engaging more directly with [ORG AAR  ] , rather than relying on [ORG TNK-BP  ] , s western managers to act in its interest . 
He added that [ORG BP  ] had succumbed to [ORG AAR  ] pressure tactics in the past and might do so again . 
End Summary. ---------------------- Three-Pronged Approach ---------------------- 2 . 
( C ) [PER Spies  ] said [ORG BP  ] is pursuing a three-pronged approach to defend its interests in [MISC TNK-BP:  ] negotiate with [ORG AAR  ] ; examine and pursue legal options as necessary ; and bring international pressure to bear on the [ORG GOR  ] and [ORG AAR  ] . 
[PER Spies  ] confirmed that [ORG BP  ] had named Amcit [PER Lamar McKay  ] , the former head of [ORG BP Russia  ] and a former [ORG TNK-BP  ] board member , to head negotiations with [ORG AAR  ] . 
[PER Spies  ] said [PER McKay  ] knew the [ORG AAR  ] partners and was well-versed in [ORG TNK-BP  ] , s history and structure . 
[PER McKay  ] would not be moving back to [LOC Moscow  ] but would meet the [ORG AAR  ] partners here and abroad in an effort to reach a resolution of the dispute . 
[PER Spies  ] added that [ORG BP  ] was prepared to defend its interests in court if negotiations failed . 
However , he described the $360 million lawsuit recently brought by [ORG BP  ] against [ORG AAR  ] in the [LOC UK  ] over 2003 tax deed of covenant as preemptory in nature , driven by concern that their claim would lapse if the suit had not been filed . 
The legal option was not [ORG BP  ] , s preferred way to resolve the dispute . 
3 . 
( C ) With respect to the third prong , [PER Spies  ] said [ORG BP  ] is briefing all [ORG G7  ] governments and requesting that they approach the [ORG GOR  ] seeking its intervention . 
He said that besides the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [LOC UK  ] , [LOC Canada  ] , [LOC Germany  ] , [LOC France  ] and [LOC Italy  ] had all expressed concern at the dispute , which they thought could undermine the position of their investors , and had expressed their intention to raise it with the [ORG GOR  ] . 
[PER Spies  ] presented us with five different briefing papers ( emailed to desk ) , which he said had also been shared with the other [ORG G7  ] governments . 
The papers refute the public attacks against [ORG BP  ] by their [ORG AAR  ] partners . 
[PER Spies  ] walked us through one paper in particular , which he said disproved the [ORG AAR  ] allegation that [ORG TNK-BP  ] had underperformed relative to its [MISC Russian  ] competitors . 
The paper noted that the fall in production and dividends in 2007 that [ORG AAR  ] had pointed to was a direct result of the 2006 sale of [ORG TNK-BP  ] subsidiary Udmurtneft , to which [ORG AAR  ] had agreed . 
The subsidiary had accounted for 10% of [ORG TNK-BP  ] , s production and the sale proceeds had been paid out as a dividend , artificially raising 2006 dividends. --------------------- [ORG AAR  ] Tactics and Goals --------------------- 4 . 
( C ) [PER Spies  ] said that despite progress on visas ( see paragraph 9 ) he expected the attacks by [ORG AAR  ] to continue . 
He pointed to the July 7 extraordinary board meeting of [LOC TNK-BP Management  ] that had been called to try to dismiss [ORG TNK-BP  ] CEO [PER Robert Dudley  ] . 
[PER Spies  ] said [ORG TNK-BP  ] Management was a cut-out that had been created to employ the company 's senior management in a manner that complied with [MISC Russian  ] tax law . 
The meeting , called at the instigation of [ORG AAR  ] partner [PER Viktor Vekselberg  ] , had been a publicity ploy . 
[PER Spies  ] explained that [ORG BP  ] controls 3 of five board seats , and that [ORG AAR  ] knew it would lose the motion . 
According to [PER Spies  ] , [ORG AAR  ] will use the vote [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00001964 002 OF 003 in favor of keeping [PER Dudley  ] to buttress their claims that [ORG BP  ] and [ORG TNK-BP  ] , s western management were acting against [LOC Russia  ] 's best interests . 
5 . 
( C ) Qccording to [PER Spies  ] , [ORG BP  ] was willing to accommodate [ORG GOR  ] interests but it was unclear what those interests were at this point . 
[ORG BP  ] , s talks with [ORG Gazprom  ] had been dormant since April and with [ORG Rosneft  ] since last year . 
[PER Spies  ] speculated that [ORG AAR  ] might be acting on behalf of a future government buyer for its share of [ORG TNK-BP  ] in order to avoid any unseemly control battles between that buyer and [ORG BP  ] . 
However , he had also heard speculation that part of [ORG AAR  ] 's motivation was to neutralize [PER Putin  ] , who was angry over their having stalled the long-pending sale of the [LOC Kovykta  ] gas field to [ORG Gazprom  ] ( ref C ) . 
By " wrapping themselves up in the [MISC Russian  ] flag " the [ORG AAR  ] partners had prevented [PER Putin  ] from moving against them , which would have been seen to be siding with foreigners against [MISC Russians  ] . 
[PER Spies  ] said that in the end , [ORG BP  ] doesn't care who its partner in [ORG TNK-BP  ] is , so long as agreements are respected and the company is managed professionally for long-term profit growth. ----------------------------- [ORG TNK-BP Management Perspective  ] ----------------------------- 6 . 
( C ) In a separate July 7 meeting , [PER McCormick  ] also pointed to the [LOC TNK-BP Management  ] board meeting as evidence that [ORG AAR  ] would continue to use every means at its disposal to take management control of [ORG TNK-BP  ] . 
( Note: On July 8 tax authorities reportedly demanded detailed records on international secondees to [ORG TNK-BP  ] . 
End note . 
) He said [PER Dudley  ] would remain the focal point because of the CEO 's powers under the shareholder agreement , which could only be changed by agreement or through the arbitration clause of the original shareholder agreement forming [ORG TNK-BP  ] , which directs disagreements to be settled by an international arbitration court in [LOC Sweden  ] . 
In the end , [PER McCormick  ] said , the [ORG AAR  ] partners would be fine with [PER Dudley  ] staying on so long as his control of the company was diluted . 
7 . 
( C ) [PER McCormick  ] said a resolution of the dispute would require [ORG BP  ] engaging directly with the [ORG AAR  ] partners . 
In that regard , he welcomed the appointment of a new [ORG BP  ] representative in charge of [ORG TNK-BP  ] negotiations . 
However , [PER McCormick  ] said [PER Lamar McKay  ] might not have been the right choice . 
[PER McKay  ] had personal issues to deal with that hampered his ability to travel . 
[PER McKay  ] had come to [LOC Moscow  ] three weeks ago but had not been back since . 
[PER McCormick  ] felt that [ORG BP  ] would be better served by having someone senior on the ground in [LOC Moscow  ] not only to resolve this dispute but to look after its interests in general . 
In fact , the absence of such an individual contributed to the appearance that [PER Dudley  ] and other [MISC Western  ] managers were acting on its behalf . 
8 . 
( C ) [PER McCormick  ] added that he was not sanguine that [ORG BP  ] would be able to successfully defend its interests . 
[ORG AAR  ] had successfully used pressure tactics against [ORG BP  ] before . 
He noted that the original sales agreement had called for [ORG BP  ] to pay half of its investment up front to the [ORG AAR  ] partners with the other half paid in yearly installments . 
However , before the ink was dry the partners had asked for all the money up front . 
[ORG BP  ] had said no and the partners had responded by effectively shutting down the company , as they were doing now . 
[ORG BP  ] had ultimately caved and might do so again unless it was willing to accept as much short-term pain as were its partners. ----- VISAS ----- 9 . 
( C ) As reported in the press , 49 expat staff of [ORG TNK-BP  ] ( actual [ORG TNK-BP  ] employees , not secondees ) have either received or should soon receive their new visas . 
There are at least another 37 employees whose visa prospects are still unclear , although 14 of these may be resolved soon . 
[PER Spies  ] and [PER McCormick  ] explained that the 150 expat employee figure often cited in the press is misleading because it represents the number of positions ( not people ) for which [ORG TNK-BP  ] management seeks visas . 
Many of these positions are duplicates or even [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00001964 003 OF 003 triplicates in some cases because the visas are granted on the basis of nationality and position . 
In order to have hiring flexibility , [ORG TNK-BP  ] management sought permits for several nationalities for a given position . 
However , due to a court order resulting from a lawsuit brought by a minority shareholder linked to [LOC Alfa  ] , there are currently no [ORG BP  ] secondees working for [ORG TNK-BP  ] , and many of these employees are now being relocated by BP. ------- COMMENT ------- 10 . 
( C ) This case sends the wrong signals about [LOC Russia  ] 's long-term investment climate and its commitment to economic reforms . 
Convincing the [MISC Russian  ] government of that is , however , another task altogether as foreign investment continues to flow into the rapidly growing economy , buoyed by rising energy prices .
