Reason 1.4 ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) In a private June 26 meeting with Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] on the margins of a lunch including [ORG Presidential Advisors Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] and [PER Gilberto Carvalho  ] , MOD [PER Jobim  ] said he believes he has the information he needs to discuss [LOC Brazil  ] 's fighter purchase with President [PER Lula  ] once the [ORG Air Force  ] makes a recommendation . 
[PER Jobim  ] told the Ambassador that he expects to receive the [ORG Air Force  ] 's position in July , after which he will be able " to speak politically . 
" [PER Jobim  ] emphasized that tech transfer would be the key factor in [LOC Brazil  ] 's decision , although he declined to be drawn into discussing whether he thought [ORG Boeing  ] 's tech transfer offer the best . 
He did say that he was convinced [ORG Boeing  ] was " sincere " in its offer . 
Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] asked whether , in the event that the [ORG Air Force  ] recommended the [ORG Super Hornet  ] , [PER Jobim  ] would endorse the recommendation . 
The Minister said he had the information he needed to support the [ORG Super Hornet  ] . 
He cautioned that he does not currently know " where [PER Lula  ] is " on the matter. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Turning to the question of industrial cooperation , [PER Jobim  ] believed that there was increasing interest in [ORG Boeing  ] 's offset package . 
He reported that he had recently discussed the issue with [ORG Embraer  ] President [PER Frederico Curado  ] who had said [ORG Embraer  ] 's priority was job creation and that [PER Curado  ] was interested in what he described as building partnership with [ORG Boeing  ] . 
[PER Jobim  ] was also impressed by the breadth of [ORG Boeing  ] 's prospective industrial cooperation , encompassing major firms such as [ORG Embraer  ] and [ORG Avibras  ] , companies with strong political connections such as [PER Santo Labs  ] , and even a business in [LOC Porto Allegre  ] , in [PER Jobim  ] 's home state of [LOC Rio Grande  ] do Sul . 
[PER Jobim  ] said he planned to meet with [ORG Boeing  ] officials in early July to learn more about the offset package. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Embassy Comment . 
Embassy believes [PER Jobim  ] 's remarks were intended to convey the sense that [ORG Boeing  ] is in a strong position to come out of the [ORG Air Force  ] phase of the selection process as a front runner . 
Should it do so , [PER Jobim  ] will likely be willing to offer his support . 
The key decision , however , will be with the [ORG National Defense Council  ] , in particular President [PER Lula  ] . 
Should [PER Lula  ] prefer one of the competitors , it is likely [PER Jobim  ] would go along . 
For this reason , USG enagement with [LOC Brazil  ] at the highest levels assumes even greater importance as we have a narrowing window to influence the fianl decision .
