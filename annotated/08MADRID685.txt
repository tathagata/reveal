End summary . 
What [ORG AFRICOM  ] Is and Is Not -------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In all of his meetings , General [PER Ward  ] stressed that [ORG AFRICOM  ] was not about the militarization of [LOC Africa  ] . 
Security assistance activities with many [MISC African  ] nations were already underway and had been for some time . 
There were already [ORG Offices of Security Cooperation  ] in many [MISC African  ] countries . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] was heavily engaged in humanitarian and development efforts on the continent . 
[ORG AFRICOM  ] 's role was to bring greater focus to existing security assistance programs and enhance the ability of the [LOC U.S.  ] military to support [ORG USG  ] efforts across the board in [LOC Africa  ] . 
He explained that [ORG AFRICOM  ] would be combining functions presently performed by [ORG EUCOM  ] , [ORG CENTCOM  ] , and [ORG PACOM  ] . 
The change was less in what the [LOC U.S.  ] did than in how it was done . 
[ORG AFRICOM  ] had a construct that was inclusive of a large number of civilian agencies ( including the [ORG Departments of Treasury and Commerce  ] and [ORG USAID  ] ) and this would increase the command 's awareness and understanding of what other agencies were doing to execute [LOC U.S.  ] policy in [LOC Africa  ] . 
The large number of civilians assigned to [ORG AFRICOM  ] were not simply liaison officers , but integral members of the command . 
[ORG AFRICOM  ] 's role was not to take over those activities but to support them effectively . 
General [PER Ward  ] noted that [ORG AFRICOM  ] had two deputy commanders , a flag officer for military operations and a [ORG Department of State  ] former ambassador to handle civil and humanitarian affairs. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) General [PER Ward  ] stressed to all his [MISC Spanish  ] interlocutors that [ORG AFRICOM  ] wanted to avoid conflicting with other international actors and donors .

[ORG AFRICOM  ] wanted to support and complement what others were doing .

General [PER Ward  ] stressed his interest in [MISC Spanish  ] views and the importance of [MISC Spanish  ] cooperation . 
He asked that [LOC Spain  ] continue the dialogue with the [LOC U.S.  ] on [MISC Africa.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) General [PER Ward  ] said the terrorism threat in [LOC Africa  ] was very real . 
[ORG Al Qaida  ] made no secret of its aims against the west . 
He noted [ORG AFRICOM  ] would play an important role in helping the states of the [LOC Sahel  ] develop the capacity to face these threats . 
He explained that [ORG AFRICOM  ] had a multi-disciplinary construct that would facilitate coordination with other [ORG USG  ] agencies as well as international partners working in [LOC Africa  ] . 
General [PER Ward  ] commended [LOC Spain  ] for the participation of its naval personnel in [ORG Africa Partnership Station  ] activities . 
He noted the [ORG Operation Enduring Freedom  ] - [ORG Trans-Sahara  ] components of the [ORG Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership  ] would pass from [ORG EUCOM  ] to [ORG AFRICOM  ] . 
General [PER Ward  ] noted [LOC U.S.  ] interest in tracking the movements of foreign fighters via the [ORG Sahel.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [MISC Spanish  ] were interested in the basing issue , but General [PER Ward  ] made clear that his priority is standing up his headquarters and his command .

Chief of [ORG Defense  ] ---------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [MISC Spanish  ] Chief of [ORG Defense General  ] [PER Felix Sanz  ] was quick to tell Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] and General [PER Ward  ] that he needed no convincing: he was already a strong supporter of [ORG AFRICOM  ] . 
He said he had confidence in [LOC U.S.  ] undertakings and valued his long association with the [LOC U.S.  ] military . 
[PER Sanz  ] said [ORG AFRICOM  ] 's success would be [LOC Spain  ] 's success . 
He noted an appreciation for the comprehensive approach [ORG AFRICOM  ] was taking , beyond the strictly military to military , and the strong civilian component within the command. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Sanz  ] said he was trying to educate the political levels of the government and welcomed any information [ORG AFRICOM  ] could provide to assist him in that effort . 
He said he would report on General [PER Ward  ] 's visit , using that as yet another opportunity to remind senior civilian leaders of what [ORG AFRICOM  ] meant for [LOC Spain  ] . 
He urged General [PER Ward  ] to stay in close contact . 
He said the [MISC Spanish  ] military would be there for [ORG AFRICOM  ] , subject of course to the policy direction of the political leadership . 
[PER Sanz  ] noted [LOC Spain  ] 's long historical association with [LOC North Africa  ] ( he recounted that a few years ago three of the four members of [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG Joint Chiefs  ] of [ORG Staff  ] were born in [LOC Africa  ] ) , but he also stressed [LOC Spain  ] 's growing interest in [LOC Africa  ] as a whole , triggered in part by illegal immigration to the [LOC Canary Islands  ] . 
[PER Sanz  ] said no other area of the world affected [MISC Spanish  ] interests more than [MISC Africa.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Sanz  ] urged General [PER Ward  ] to be stubborn in building an understanding of and support for [ORG AFRICOM  ] 's mission . 
He noted there were political factors that could not be ignored , but insisted the key was to be persistent and keep explaining the positive goals of [ORG AFRICOM  ] . 
He predicted those in [LOC Spain  ] who understood the problems of [LOC Africa  ] would be supportive . 
[PER Sanz  ] also suggested stressing to political interlocutors the benefits to [LOC Spain  ] of [ORG AFRICOM  ] . 
He suggested that in terms of [MISC Spanish  ] involvement , a modest start would give people a chance to become accustomed to the idea .

[PER Leon  ] said it was time for [LOC Algeria  ] to accept [LOC Morocco  ] 's apology and open theborder . 
He said [LOC Spain  ] had proposed a joint energy project which [LOC Algeria  ] had not yet opposed although [PER Leon  ] noted an [MISC Algerian  ] tendency to raise objections at the last moment andto use [LOC Western Sahara  ] as an excuse . 
[PER Leon  ] said [LOC Algeria  ] was aware [LOC Morocco  ] would never leave [LOC Western Sahara  ] . 
[LOC Algeria  ] was simply trying to make things more complicated for [LOC Morocco  ] and use the issue as leverage on other matters . 
[PER Leon  ] noted five percent of [LOC Morocco  ] 's GDP was tied up in [LOC Western Sahara  ] .

( C ) [PER Leon  ] noted [LOC sub-Saharan Africa  ] was becoming a very important of [LOC Spain  ] 's national security concerns and presented multiple complex challenges . 
He said [LOC Spain  ] was especially concerned about the [LOC Sahel  ] which he described as a line running from troubled states such as [LOC Somalia  ] and [LOC Sudan  ] all the way across to the [LOC Canary Islands  ] . 
He noted [LOC Spain  ] had recently opened new embassies in [LOC Mali  ] , [LOC Niger  ] , and [LOC Sudan  ] . 
[PER Leon  ] stated [LOC Spain  ] was working on an updated ( 2008-2012 ) version of its [ORG Plan Africa  ] for the sub-Sahara . 
He also said the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] was elevating sub-Saharan [LOC Africa  ] to a full director generalship ( until recently it had been handled by a sub-DG under a DG also responsible for [LOC North Africa  ] and the [LOC Middle East  ] ) and that [MISC Spanish  ] aid for the region had multiplied five times since 2004 ( approaching one billion euros ) . <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 .

[PER Leon  ] said [LOC Spain  ] was trying to organize a framework for cooperation in [LOC West Africa  ] to help those countries confront the threat from organized crime . 
He said states such as [LOC Guinea-Bissau  ] were weak and vulnerable to drug , arms , and alien traffickers . 
[PER Leon  ] noted [LOC Sudan  ] was very complicated with the north-south problem unresolved and [ORG Darfur  ] getting even more complicated . 
He opined that the current system of sanctions was ineffective given the attitude of [LOC China.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Leon  ] mentioned he had recently visited [LOC Chad  ] . 
He said it was important to work with the [ORG AU  ] , but he was pessimistic . 
He did not expect anything from the [MISC Libyans  ] , and he suggested a need to find some way to work with the [MISC Chinese  ] in [LOC Africa  ] . 
He noted they were widely present on the continent but did not see many of the troublesome regimes as the [LOC West  ] saw them. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Leon  ] predicted [LOC Mali  ] and [LOC Niger  ] could do well with the support of the international community .

[PER Leon  ] said [LOC Spain  ] was interested in helping in the region . 
He said [LOC Conakry Guinea  ] had a good president but suffered from corruption . 
He noted [LOC Spain  ] had seen a problem with merchant vessels leaving [LOC Conakry  ] headed for the [LOC Canary Islands  ] , and [MISC Spanish  ] intelligence services were trying to keep an eye on the situation . 
He was even more critical of [LOC Guinea Bissau  ] . 
He said he had visited and urged the president to fire the [ORG MOI  ] , which he did , but [PER Leon  ] said everyone in the government was tainted to some degree by corruption . 
He noted the islands operated almost as independent states ( he cited a [MISC French  ] hotel with its own airstrip which operated without regard to the country 's customs and immigration authorities ) . 
He said some of the islands had airstrips which were being used by [MISC South American  ] drug traffickers . 
[LOC Spain  ] was considering providing some job training , repairing a road to improve access to the main harbor and perhaps sending a patrol boat to be jointly manned by [MISC Spanish  ] and local officials. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Turning to [LOC Senegal  ] , [LOC Mauritania  ] , and the [LOC Gambia  ] , [PER Leon  ] said [LOC Spain  ] was working to improve their capacity .

( C ) [PER Leon  ] said [LOC Spain  ] had developed good relations with [LOC Angola  ] and [LOC Mozambique  ] in the wake of [LOC Portugal  ] 's withdrawal .

( C ) [PER Angel Lossada  ] , the new number two in the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] , stressed that [LOC Africa  ] was no longer a far away place to [LOC Spain  ] .

[ORG Frontex  ] , joint maritime patrols with some [MISC West African  ] countries , etc . 
) . 
[PER Lossada  ] identified lack of economic opportunity and good governance as key challenges and said [LOC Spain  ] was trying to help address these problems . 
[PER Lossada  ] said [LOC Spain  ] was trying to stem illegal immigration not only by improving the law enforcement response but by working with source countries on creating more opportunity at home , directing remittances towards productive economy activity , etc . 
[PER Lossada  ] noted [LOC Spain  ] 's recent contribution of two military transport aircraft and support personnel to the [ORG EU  ] effort in [LOC Chad  ] .

( C ) Keying off General [PER Ward  ] 's remarks on the [ORG Africa Partnership Station  ] , [PER Lossada  ] said he could see many avenues for cooperation in [LOC Africa  ] . 
[PER Lossada  ] said he was certain the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Spain  ] could find ways to mutually reinforce each other 's work in [LOC Africa  ] . 
Secretary General for [ORG Defense Policy  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) Secretary General for [ORG Defense Policy  ] [PER Luis Cuesta  ] commended the comprehensive approach of [ORG AFRICOM  ] and said [LOC Spain  ] likewise was trying to take a broad vision of the continent . 
[PER Cuesta  ] likened [ORG AFRICOM  ] to a provincial reconstruction team for [LOC Africa  ] . 
He noted the objectives of [ORG AFRICOM  ] meshed well with [LOC Spain  ] 's own interests in counter-terrorism and fighting drug trafficking and illegal immigration . 
As did all General [PER Ward  ] 's interlocutors , [PER Cuesta  ] stressed that [LOC Africa  ] had become a priority for [LOC Spain  ] . 
[PER Cuesta  ] said the objectives of [ORG AFRICOM  ] were favorable to [LOC Spain  ] 's interests in the region . 
He noted the increased [MISC Spanish  ] diplomatic presence and increased aid. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) [PER Cuesta  ] noted the rise in illegal immigration to [LOC Spain  ] from [LOC Africa  ] and [LOC Spain  ] 's efforts to stem that , in part by increasing security engagement with [LOC West Africa  ] ( [ORG Frontex  ] , [ORG Operation Noble Sentinel  ] , joint patrols , etc . 
) . 
[PER Cuesta  ] also pointed to [LOC Spain  ] 's efforts to support economic development in the source countries , including job training both to encourage people to stay home and to ensure those coming to [LOC Spain  ] via legal channels had the skills they needed to succeed . 
[PER Cuesta  ] mentioned technical assistance and training to police in [LOC Niger  ] and [LOC Mali  ] .

) . 
[PER Cuesta  ] mentioned [LOC Spain  ] was leading an [ORG EU  ] mission on security sector reform in [LOC Guinea  ] [ORG Bissau  ] .

( C ) [PER Cuesta  ] said the [MISC Spanish  ] view of [ORG AFRICOM  ] would to a great extent be shaped by the views of the [MISC African  ] countries with which [LOC Spain  ] had close relations . 
He said [MISC Spanish  ] observers in [ORG AFRICOM  ] exercises and training evolutions would be a positive step . 
[PER Cuesta  ] suggested there might be an increase in operational tempo at [LOC Rota  ] and [LOC Moron  ] due to [ORG AFRICOM  ] and assured General [PER Ward  ] that [LOC Spain  ] was ready to support that in accordance with the bilateral Agreement on [ORG Defense Cooperation  ] , although he noted it would be difficult for [LOC Spain  ] to participate in or support direct action missions in [LOC Africa  ] without some stamp of international legitimacy such as the consent of the country in question or a UNSCR. <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( C ) [PER Cuesta  ] said transparency would be a key element for success in terms of securing [MISC Spanish  ] support for [ORG AFRICOM  ] 's activities . 
General [PER Ward  ] noted the [ORG Africa Partnership Station  ] experience with [LOC Spain  ] had been positive . 
He also mentioned involving [LOC Spain  ] in [LOC Flintlock  ] . 
General [PER Ward  ] said as [ORG AFRICOM  ] becomes fully operational [LOC Spain  ] should not expect changes except in the sense of more information and greater willingness to include [LOC Spain  ] . 
General [PER Ward  ] said observers were welcomed but participants from [LOC Spain  ] would be even better . 
He noted the [MISC Spanish  ] who had participated in the [ORG Africa Partnership Station  ] had contributed a great deal. <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( C ) Asked about what concerns he had heard expressed about [ORG AFRICOM  ] , [PER Cuesta  ] said [LOC Spain  ] had heard skepticism from the [MISC Sudanese  ] and [LOC South Africans  ] . 
Nevertheless , [PER Cuesta  ] said security force reform , security assistance , development aid , etc. was music to [LOC Spain  ] 's ears and that was why General [PER Ward  ] 's visit was so important . 
[PER Cuesta  ] noted [LOC Africa  ] was only 12 kilometers from [LOC Spain  ] and said [LOC Spain  ] had long watched the [LOC Maghreb  ] closely but was now paying more attention to sub-Saharan [LOC Africa  ] . 
[LOC Spain  ] Eager to Send Liaison Officer ----------------------------------- <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( C ) Both General [PER Sanz  ] and [PER Luis Cuesta  ] expressed strong interest in sending a liaison officer to [ORG AFRICOM  ] . 
[PER Cuesta  ] said he had mentioned this idea to the [ORG MOD  ] ( Note: As detailed in reftel , the [ORG MOD  ] in turn mentioned the idea to Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] during a June 10 breakfast . 
She also told the Ambassador [MISC Spanish  ] public opinion would be critical in determining the level of [ORG GOS  ] engagement with [ORG AFRICOM  ] and said that while the [ORG GOS  ] was interested in being a part of efforts in [LOC Africa  ] , much work remained to be done . 
She asked that the USG coordinate closely with [LOC Spain  ] on next steps . 
End note ) . 
General [PER Ward  ] explained he would be very open to the possibility of a [MISC Spanish  ] military liaison officer at [ORG AFRICOM  ] once the command was prepared to receive liaison officers . 
[ORG Somali Pirates  ] -------------- <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( C ) [PER Leon  ] , [PER Lossada  ] , and [PER Cuesta  ] all stressed the problem of piracy off [LOC Somalia  ] and cited the recent capture of a [MISC Spanish  ] fishing vessel in April ( and repeated that [LOC Spain  ] was grateful for [LOC U.S.  ] assistance in that instance ) . 
They indicated [LOC Spain  ] was taking a serious look at a possible multinational response . 
[PER Leon  ] mentioned he had just returned from [LOC Washington  ] where he had discussed the idea with the [ORG NATO  ] SYG . 
[PER Leon  ] hoped that with [ORG UNSCR  ] 1816 it would be possible to organize an international response . 
[PER Cuesta  ] said [LOC Spain  ] might be organizing a meeting for the defense and foreign ministries of the countries that had supported [ORG UNSCR  ] 1816 to see what concrete action might be taken . 
[PER Cuesta  ] added that [LOC Spain  ] might also try and work this issue via the [ORG EU  ] . 
General [PER Ward  ] agreed piracy was a common threat . 
He noted the passage of the [ORG UNSCR  ] 1816 had been a positive step . 
He acknowledge there could be opportunities for cooperative action but made clear that decisions regarding anti-piracy operations would be made on a political level . 
Press ----- <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
( U ) General [PER Ward  ] was interviewed by a journalist from leading [MISC Spanish  ] daily [ORG El Pais  ] and had the opportunity to make many of the same points he had made in his private meetings regarding the purpose of [ORG AFRICOM  ] and its benefits to [LOC Spain  ] and other countries with interests in the region . 
The article that resulted was straightforward , and we are sure will help demystify [ORG AFRICOM  ] for many [MISC Spaniards  ] . 
Comment ------- <a id='par29' href='#par29'>¶</a>29 . 
( C ) General [PER Ward  ] 's visit to [LOC Spain  ] was a resounding success from our point of view . 
He was able to meet with senior [MISC Spanish  ] officials and reassure them about the purpose and vision of [ORG AFRICOM  ] . 
In each case , he encountered a very serious and thoughtful response as well as a clear disposition to work with [ORG AFRICOM  ] . 
General [PER Ward  ] conveyed very effectively a genuine interest in [LOC Spain  ] 's views and a disposition to work cooperatively with our [MISC Spanish  ] allies . 
We are convinced this visit and General [PER Ward  ] 's deft handling of his [MISC Spanish  ] interlocutors will pay enormous dividends down the road as we try to coordinate or even combine [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] efforts in [LOC Africa  ] or if we ever decide to base some portion of [ORG AFRICOM  ] in [LOC Spain  ] . 
We are extremely grateful that General [PER Ward  ] committed so much time and effort here and look forward to a return visit at his earliest opportunity .
