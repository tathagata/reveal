End summary . 
2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) A team from the [ORG DOE  ] 's Office of [ORG Global Threat Reduction  ] traveled to [LOC Libya  ] December 9-12 to meet with [MISC Libyan  ] science community counterparts to finalize language for a [ORG Highly-Enriched Uranium/Low-Enriched Uranium  ] ( HEU-LEU ) agreement . 
The delegation , consisting of [PER Kelly Cummins  ] ( [ORG Delegation Head  ] ) , [PER Phil Robinson  ] ( Country Officer ) , [PER Diana Clarke  ] ( General Counsel ) , [PER Igor Bolshinsky  ] ( Technical Lead ) and [PER Stan Moses  ] ( Technical Staff ) met with Dr. [PER Abdelkarem Mgeg  ] , Director of the [ORG Tajoura Renewable Energies  ] and [ORG Water Desalination Research Center  ] , to resolve issues and finalize language for a related to a government-to-government agreement between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG GOL  ] . 
The agreement would facilitate the return to [LOC Russia  ] of 26 fuel assemblies comprising approximately 4.6 kilograms of [MISC HEU  ] material . 
( Note: Technical Lead Bolshinsky confirmed December 9 that all HE material was still physically present at the [LOC Tajoura  ] facility . 
End note . 
) The agreement would complete the process begun in March 2004 , when the [ORG GOL  ] returned to [LOC Russia  ] 15 kilograms of [MISC HEU  ] material . 
3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) It is envisaged that the material would be transferred to [LOC Russia  ] by air circa late 2009 . 
In addition to fuel return , the agreement includes language detailing cooperation on nuclear and radiological security enhancements at the [LOC Tajoura  ] site and other facilities in [LOC Libya  ] , to include four hospitals in [LOC Benghazi  ] , [LOC Sabratha  ] and [LOC Tripoli  ] ( two facilities ) . 
Implementing additional security measures as the [LOC Tajoura  ] site could occur 12-24 months after the agreement is signed ; radiological/security upgrades at the hospitals could be made within several months of signing . 
4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Discussion on day one of the talks , which took place at the [LOC Tajoura  ] facility , focused on resolving issues associated with the agreement . 
[ORG GOL  ] officials initially expressed some concern that the agreement included language regarding enhancement of physical protection measures ; however , a closer reading and explanation by the [ORG DOE  ] 's experts convinced them that the language was anodyne . 
Consensus was also achieved on language concerning audit and inspection protocols . 
[ORG DOE  ] delegation head [PER Cummins  ] and Director [PER Mgeg  ] initialed the draft agreement to signal consensus on the language . 
5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Day two focused on finalizing language for a Basic Ordering Agreement ( [ORG BOA  ] ) contract between the [LOC Oak Ridge National Laboratory  ] and the [LOC Tajoura  ] facility . 
After minor changes to the scope of the work at the [ORG GOL  ] 's request , the two sides achieved consensus on final language . 
6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG GOL  ] agreed to provide an [MISC Arabic  ] language translation of the agreement and the [ORG BOA  ] ; however , given concerns about how quickly the [ORG GOL  ] would honor that commitment , post understands that NEA/MAG has asked Language Services to prepare treaty-ready translations . 
The [ORG GOL  ] stressed that the agreement would have to be approved by the relevant ministries before it could be signed . 
( Note: It may also have to be blessed by the General People 's [ORG Congress  ] . 
End note . 
) [MISC Libyan  ] interlocutors were optimistic that the agreement could be finalized on their side in time for a visit by a senior [ORG State Department  ] official in early 2008 . 
Following the negotiations , the [ORG DOE  ] team learned that Dr. [PER Ali Gashut  ] , the senior [MISC Libyan  ] interlocutor on technical nuclear issues , had obtained a copy of the agreement and was working to obtain the requisite [ORG GOL  ] TRIPOLI 00001065 002 OF 002 approvals . 
7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: In the [ORG DOE  ] team 's judgment , the meetings were positive and cooperative , suggesting that the [ORG GOL  ] wants to quickly finalize and implement the agreement . 
The [ORG GOL  ] ultimately insisted on only minor changes to the original draft agreement . 
Despite the enthusiasm of the [LOC Tajoura  ] facility scientists and the avowed interest of other senior [ORG GOL  ] officials in signing the agreement , obtaining approval from the appropriate ministries may be time-consuming and difficult . 
The fact that the [ORG GOL  ] clearly expects that the agreement will be signed in connection with a putative senior-level visit early next year may help expedite the [MISC Libyan  ] interagency process .
