( S ) The [ORG MOD  ] is evaluating and prioritizing all foreign assistance projects in the [MISC Palestinian  ] territories in order to determine which should have continued support from the [ORG MOD  ] , [PER Brig. General  ] ( res . 
) [PER Baruch Spiegel  ] told [ORG POL  ] and [ORG ECON  ] counselors on February 14 . 
Minister of [ORG Defense Mofaz  ] had ordered [MISC Gen. Mishlev  ] , head of [LOC COGAT  ] , to initiate the process with [PER Spiegel  ] three weeks ago . 
[PER Spiegel  ] said they would place the projects into three categories ) high , medium , and low priority . 
Despite the uncertainty following the recent [ORG Palestinian Legislative Council  ] elections and the [MISC Israeli  ] Cabinet decision that the GOI will not talk to [ORG Hamas  ] , [ORG Mofaz  ] believes it is in [LOC Israel  ] , s interest to maintain stability and ensure that basic humanitarian needs of the [MISC Palestinians  ] are met. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) [PER Spiegel  ] said that he has been meeting with foreign donors to discuss their projects and to hear their views regarding which should be retained . 
The main standard the [ORG MOD  ] is using , said [PER Spiegel  ] , is whether a project benefits the [MISC Palestinian  ] people . 
He said that environmental projects , and those dealing with water , sewage , and electrification , for example , should continue . 
( [PER Note: Spiegel  ] told [ORG USAID  ] director in a separate meeting on February 13 that projects that promoted private sector jobs for [MISC Palestinians  ] are also a priority . 
End note . 
) Consideration is also being given to a project , s benefit to [LOC Israel  ] . 
[PER Spiegel  ] pointed to projects such as the [MISC French  ] electrification project in [LOC Jenin  ] , road construction , and the [LOC Hebron  ] sewage treatment plant as examples of projects that benefited the [MISC Palestinians  ] and had a direct impact on [LOC Israel  ] and which he would recommend for continuation . 
The [ORG MOD  ] , s concerns with the continuation of certain projects are all based on legal status and security , he said. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) [PER Spiegel  ] said that his office will draw up a list as quickly as possible of prioritized assistance projects that should be continued and present it to [ORG MOD  ] Mofaz to be discussed with Acting PM [PER Olmert  ] . 
Although the listing will serve only as a guideline , [PER Spiegel  ] believed that his recommendations and philosophy would be taken very seriously . 
[PER Spiegel  ] planned to meet with [ORG USAID  ] and [ORG Embassy  ] officers next week to review the projects . 
( Note: [ORG USAID  ] director will meet with [PER Gen. Mishlev  ] on February 19 to discuss USAID-funded projects . 
End note . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) Comment: If the process that [PER Spiegel  ] described is , in fact , used , the [ORG MOD  ] may be planning to take a very practical and humanitarian approach to assistance to the [MISC Palestinians  ] . 
Instability or a humanitarian crisis in the territories is in no one , s interest , least of all [LOC Israel  ] , s . 
Clarifying GOI priorities and explaining which assistance projects are acceptable for continuation will benefit the Department during this period of uncertainty . 
While this practical approach by the [ORG MOD  ] bodes well for continued assistance to the [MISC Palestinians  ] , it does not necessarily translate into [MISC Israeli  ] support for many [ORG USAID  ] assistance projects . 
As can be seen from [PER Spiegel  ] , s examples , the [ORG MOD  ] is most interested in preserving programs that also offer significant benefit for [LOC Israel  ] , such as sewage treatment . 
Not all of the most effective [LOC U.S.  ] projects can be characterized as dual use , and there is a decided lack of attention in the [ORG MOD  ] , s calculus to programs for democracy development .
