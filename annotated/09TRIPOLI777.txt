( [ORG SBU  ] ) P/E Chief delivered reftel demarche jointly with the [MISC French  ] DCM ( at [LOC Embassy  ] of [LOC France  ] 's request ) to the Deputy Director of the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG MFA  ] 's [ORG International Organizations Office  ] , [PER Murat Humaima  ] , on September 30 . 
[PER Humaima  ] responded that [LOC Libya  ] was unequivocally against nuclear enrichment for military purposes and was supportive of nonproliferation goals . 
The best evidence of that , he said , was [LOC Libya  ] 's unilateral decision in 2003 to dismantle its Weapons of [ORG Mass Destruction  ] ( [ORG WMD  ] ) programs . 
[PER Humaima  ] said that while he had not heard from the [MISC Iranian  ] side on the issue , he expected the [MISC Iranians  ] to reach out to convey an explanation of their activities . 
After proper review , he said , [LOC Libya  ] would be able to take proper action vis-a-vis the [MISC Iranians  ] . 
2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Humaima  ] expressed [LOC Libya  ] 's strong position against the use of sanctions to address breaches of international obligations ; rather , such situations must be resolved through discussion and diplomacy . 
He said that the October 1 meeting of the [LOC P5+1  ] in [LOC Geneva  ] to discuss the issue was the right approach . 
The [ORG GOL  ] believes the matter belongs to the [ORG IAEA  ] and should not be addressed within the [ORG UN Security Council  ] context . 
The [ORG GOL  ] is , however , supportive of [ORG POTUS  ] 's initiatives on nonproliferation as articulated during the September 24 UNSC meeting . 
3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC UK  ] DCM informed P/E Chief separately September 30 that he had delivered the same demarche the previous day . 
While the [ORG GOL  ] response was largely the same , his interlocutor had not mentioned the [ORG GOL  ] position against sanctions .
