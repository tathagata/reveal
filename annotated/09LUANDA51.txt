( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] During a January 23 call by Ambassador [PER Mozena  ] , [MISC Chinese  ] Ambassador [PER Bolum Zhang  ] said negotiations will soon begin between [LOC China  ] and [LOC Angola  ] for a new loan package valued in the [MISC USD  ] " multiple single digit billions . 
" [PER Zhang  ] said the new agreement will not be backed by oil , but should receive a sovereign guarantee from the [ORG GRA  ] . 
[PER Zhang  ] distanced himself from the " private " [ORG China International Fund  ] , which has weak management and poor leadership in [LOC Angola  ] , despite its close links to the [MISC Angolan  ] presidency . 
[PER Zhang  ] expressed considerable interest in working with the [ORG USG  ] on a bilateral development assistance project in [LOC Angola  ] . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Background: In a wide ranging and open conversation with Ambassador [PER Mozena  ] , Ambassador [PER Zhang  ] said President [PER Dos Santos  ] 's December visit to [LOC China  ] opened new channels for political dialogue to build mutual trust and understanding . 
[PER Zhang  ] said [LOC China  ] supports [LOC Angola  ] 's reconstruction efforts and is providing technology , equipment , and communications infrastructure through government-to-government oil-backed loans , some grants , and company-to-country business deals . 
In discussions with [MISC Chinese  ] leaders , including Ambassador [PER Zhang  ] , senior [ORG GRA  ] officials have made clear that [LOC Angola  ] requires over [MISC USD  ] 12 billion in additional loans to meet its short term development goals . 
[PER Zhang  ] said a 2003 decision by the [ORG GOC  ] to cap the value of [MISC Chinese  ] loans to [LOC Africa  ] at [MISC USD  ] 10 billion likely means [LOC China  ] will be unable to meet the [ORG GRA  ] requests , as [MISC Chinese  ] [ORG Ex-Im  ] debt in [LOC Angola  ] alone is [MISC USD  ] 4.5 billion ( 2.5 billion expended , 2 billion still available ) . 
[PER Zhang  ] said [LOC China  ] 's rights to [MISC Angolan  ] oil ( as a result of the oil-backed loans extended to the [ORG GRA  ] ) represented less than 200 million barrels of oil in 2008 , with most of the crude coming from a [ORG Block  ] 18 contract among the [ORG CIF  ] , [ORG Sinopec  ] , and [ORG BP  ] . 
[PER Zhang  ] said [ORG Sinopec  ] ships [ORG Block  ] 18 oil directly to [LOC China  ] , rather than trading it on the open market , though [LOC China  ] pays the prevailing market price. -------------------------------------- Negotiations Toward a [ORG New Loan Package  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Zhang  ] said [PER Dos Santos  ] discussed a new loan package for [LOC Angola  ] during his December 16-19 trip to [LOC China  ] . 
[PER Zhang  ] said that while negotiations have not yet begun , it was clear that these loans would not be backed by [LOC Angola  ] 's oil reserves as that would be " too humiliating " for the [MISC Angolans  ] . 
[PER Zhang  ] said that while the [MISC Chinese  ] [ORG Ex-Im Bank  ] is taking the lead on negotiations with [LOC Angola  ] on the loan package , the funds would be made available through credit extended by private [MISC Chinese  ] banks , similar to a government-coordinated investment fund . 
[PER Zhang  ] said the structure of the loans and the interest rate would be the key points in negotiations . 
He added that he hoped [LOC Angola  ] would offer a sovereign guarantee to help make the loans more appealing to investors . 
When asked the total value of the proposed package , [PER Zhang  ] said it would be in the [MISC USD  ] " multiple single digit billions . 
" [PER Zhang  ] said few details would be released about the plan during the bilateral negotiations , but the program would be completely transparent when finished and announced to the press . 
[PER Zhang  ] said it is likely that most of the funds will be used by [LOC Angola  ] to secure [MISC Chinese  ] goods and services in support of [ORG GRA  ] reconstruction priorities , such as the new airport in [LOC Luanda  ] , new roads , and the rehabilitation of [LOC Angola  ] 's railroads and port facilities. ---------------- [ORG Ex-Im  ] versus [ORG CIF  ] ---------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) When asked to clarify the relationship between the [MISC USD  ] 4.5 billion [ORG Ex-Im  ] loan and [LOC Angola  ] 's relationship with the [ORG China International Fund  ] ( [ORG CIF  ] ) , [PER Zhang  ] was unable or unwilling to go too far into specifics , especially concerning the value of the relationship , which some independent press sources place at near [MISC USD  ] 10 billion since 2002 . 
[PER Zhang  ] did say the [ORG CIF  ] made many promises to [LOC Angola  ] , and that while the company has a large presence in [LOC Angola  ] , its weak management and lack of leadership have stalled many of the projects . 
[PER Zhang  ] said that as the [ORG CIF  ] is a " private company , " the [MISC Chinese  ] embassy does not actively participate or monitor its relationship with [LOC Angola  ] . 
He added that [ORG CIF  ] continues to benefit from the [MISC Hong Kong-based  ] owner 's " close relationship " with President [PER Dos Santos  ] . 
[PER Zhang  ] said that while many of the bilateral projects were begun by the [ORG CIF  ] , currently many of the [ORG CIF  ] 's subcontractors are dealing directly with the various ministries of the [LOC GRA.  ] ---------------- The [ORG Path Forward  ] ---------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Zhang  ] said the bilateral discussions during President [PER Dos Santos' China  ] visit focused on [LOC Angola  ] 's plan for reconstruction and economic development . 
[PER Zhang  ] said [LOC Angola  ] has many plans , but lacks the available capital to place them in motion . 
[PER Zhang  ] mentioned projects such as the new [LOC Luanda  ] airport ( which will cost [MISC USD  ] 2 billion and take 3-4 years to build ) , highway construction , railroad construction , the refurbishing of the [LOC Lobito  ] port and the construction of new maritime facilities near [LOC Luanda  ] and [LOC Soyo  ] . 
He said those projects alone could cost up to [MISC USD  ] 8 billion , adding that [LOC China  ] will not be able to offer sufficient loans to meet [LOC Angola  ] 's needs . 
He expressed concern that [ORG GRA  ] leaders are misreading the severity of the current global economic crisis and its effect on [LOC China  ] 's ability to raise private funds for projects in [LOC Angola.  ] --------------------------------------------- -- Agriculture and [ORG Joint Cooperation  ] with the [LOC U.S.  ] --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Zhang  ] said [LOC China  ] is promoting a " model farm " program in [LOC Africa  ] to help developing countries learn agribusiness skills so they can become self-sufficient in production and add value to the export chain of agricultural products . 
Despite [LOC China  ] 's broad relationship with the [ORG GRA  ] , [LOC Angola  ] is only on the second tier of proposed country projects . 
Ambassador [PER Mozena  ] raised the possibility of a joint [MISC U.S.-China  ] assistance project focused on agriculture or health - symbolic of our shared goals toward a more peaceful , prosperous , secure , and healthy [LOC Angola  ] . 
[PER Zhang  ] was very supportive of the initiative and said [MISC Chinese  ] companies , already under contract with [ORG Ex-Im  ] , would be pleased to support such a project . 
Both Ambassadors undertook to develop proposals for further consideration. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The conversation with [PER Zhang  ] was surprising in its rich content and constructive , collaborative tone . 
While [PER Zhang  ] was careful not to go into much detail concerning the activities of the [ORG CIF  ] , it is clear he wants to distance the Embassy and the Government of [LOC China  ] from what he appears to consider a less than fully transparent and successful relationship between the [ORG CIF  ] and the [ORG GRA  ] . 
He was positive and pragmatic about the forthcoming negotiations toward a new commercial line of credit for [LOC Angola  ] . 
We look forward to working with [PER Zhang  ] in the near future toward a joint bilateral development project . 
It is important that [MISC Angolans  ] and other [LOC Africa  ] watchers view how our two countries can cooperate toward a shared vision of a better [LOC Angola  ] .
