<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L WELLINGTON 000611 SIPDIS DEPT FOR EAP/ANP EO 12958 DECL: 07/18/2014 TAGS PGOV , PREL , [LOC PINR  ] , [LOC NZ  ] SUBJECT: [LOC NEW ZEALAND  ] PRAISED BY ISLAMIC RESISTANCE MOVEMENT [ORG HAMAS  ] FOR RESPONSE TO [MISC ISRAELI  ] SPY SCANDAL REF: [PER A. WELLINGTON  ] 605 [PER B. WELLINGTON  ] 599 Classified By: POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC COUNSELOR , [PER TIMOTHY ZUNIGA-BROWN  ] , FOR REASONS 1.5 ( B , D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) According to media reports , the [MISC Palestinian  ] terrorist organization [ORG Hamas  ] issued a press release July 17 thanking the [ORG GoNZ  ] for Prime Minister [PER Helen Clark’s  ] strong response to the conviction of two suspected [MISC Israeli  ] intelligence agents ( ref a ) . 
The press release urged other countries to follow the model set by [LOC New Zealand  ] in “adopting firm measures against the Zionist entity’s violations of laws on foreign lands to achieve certain targets.” <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) The [ORG GNZ  ] has been quick to renounce any sympathy for [ORG Hamas  ] . 
PM [PER Clark  ] noted that [ORG Hamas  ] should not take comfort from the GoNZ’s actions , and if [ORG Hamas  ] agents had committed the same crimes , they would be subject to the same prosecution . 
Domestic media reported separately that a religious terrorism professor at [ORG Auckland University  ] suggested that NZ’s position offers [LOC New Zealand  ] military serving in [LOC Iraq  ] “protection.” <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Comment: [LOC New Zealand  ] continues to voice its strong support of the [MISC Roadmap  ] , but is loathe to take actions that would identify it as a supporter of [LOC Israel  ] and , by proxy , the [LOC United States  ] . 
The [ORG GoNZ  ] prides itself on its multi-lateral credentials ( ref B ) but has been increasingly trying to stand alongside “Non-Aligned” countries . 
Its overly strong reaction to [LOC Israel  ] over this issue suggests the [ORG GNZ  ] sees this flap as an opportunity to bolster its credibility with the [MISC Arab  ] community , and by doing so , perhaps , help [LOC NZ  ] lamb and other products gain greater access to a larger and more lucrative market .
