SUMMARY <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Bahamian  ] Prime Minister [PER Perry Christie  ] will lead an official government delegation to [LOC China  ] on August 14-21 , continuing a two-year upswing in diplomatic exchanges between [LOC The Bahamas  ] and [LOC China  ] . 
In addition to numerous cultural programs , the two nations have exchanged high-level delegations to explore business opportunities and strengthen diplomatic ties . 
The majority of the [MISC Bahamian  ] cabinet visits have been hosted by the [MISC Chinese  ] government -- nominally to discuss [MISC Chinese  ] support of [LOC The Bahamas’  ] membership in the [ORG World Trade Organization  ] . 
Despite being separated by two oceans and a continental landmass , [LOC China  ] is one of only four countries that maintains a resident ambassador in [LOC The Bahamas  ] . 
[LOC The Bahamas’  ] largest port facility in [LOC Freeport  ] is owned and operated by [MISC Hong Kong-based  ] Hutchison-Whampoa . 
The [MISC Bahamian  ] press gives generally positive and extensive coverage to [LOC China  ] and interprets the growing [MISC China-Bahamas  ] relationship as a sign of [LOC The Bahamas’  ] increasing importance in the world and friendship with a potential superpower . 
END SUMMARY . 
[MISC BAHAMIAN  ] DIGNITARIES “FREQUENT FLYERS” TO CHINA... <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Prime Minister [PER Perry Christie  ] is scheduled to visit [LOC Beijing  ] and [LOC Shanghai  ] from August 14 - 21 , 2004 . 
This will be the Prime Minister’s first official trip to [LOC China  ] . 
Accompanying [PER Christie  ] will be his wife and daughter , Minister of [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] [PER Fred Mitchell  ] , Minister of State for Finance [PER James Smith  ] , the Prime Minister’s Permanent Secretary [PER Ronald Thompson  ] , and two reporters . 
An advance team consisting of Chief of Protocol [PER Andrew McKinney  ] and Under Secretary at the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] [PER Philip Miller  ] SIPDIS has already departed for [LOC China  ] . 
The [MISC Bahamian  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] has been unwilling to provide details about the delegation’s itinerary , schedule or meetings , or the purpose of the trip. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) The Prime Minister’s trip to [LOC China  ] is the latest is a stream of high-level [MISC Bahamian  ] visitors to [LOC China  ] since the PLP’s electoral victory in May 2002 . 
In the past year , a number of [MISC Bahamian  ] government officials have visited [LOC China  ] including Cabinet-level ministers and members of parliament . 
On August 30 , 2003 , Foreign Minister [PER Fred Mitchell  ] and Minister of [ORG Transport and Aviation  ] [PER Glenys Hanna-Martin  ] both traveled to [LOC China  ] . 
They met with the [MISC Chinese  ] Minister of [LOC Commerce  ] to discuss [ORG World Trade Organization  ] ( [ORG WTO  ] ) issues as the [LOC Bahamas  ] prepares for [ORG WTO  ] membership . 
Ministers [PER Mitchell  ] and [PER Hanna-Martin  ] also met with China’s Minister of Culture . 
While there , the [MISC Chinese  ] arranged for Minister [PER Hanna-Martin  ] to commission a [MISC Chinese-built  ] ship that will be registered with the [MISC Bahamas’  ] ship registry . 
Just two months later in October , Minister of [ORG Trade and Industry  ] [PER Leslie Miller  ] visited [LOC Beijing  ] , again ostensibly to promote The [MISC Bahamas’  ] accession to the [ORG WTO  ] . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX [MISC CHINESE  ] PRESENCE IN THE [LOC BAHAMAS  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [LOC China  ] is one of four countries to maintain resident ambassadors in The [LOC Bahamas  ] . 
Ambassador [PER Dongcun Jiao  ] presented his credentials to Governor General Dame [PER Ivy Dumont  ] on August 21 , 2003 . 
During the swearing in , Governor General Dame [PER Ivy Dumont  ] thanked the Ambassador for his country’s assistance in the areas of education , agriculture , fisheries and the arts . 
Ambassador [PER Jiao  ] noted that the [LOC Bahamas  ] and [LOC China  ] have coordinated with and supported each other in international affairs . 
He further stated that the [MISC Chinese  ] government is ready to make concerted efforts with the [MISC Bahamian  ] government to build a [MISC China-Bahamas  ] relationship of all-round cooperation in the interest of mutual development . 
Currently , the exceptionally large [MISC Chinese  ] embassy in [LOC The Bahamas  ] , given the paucity of bilateral business to conduct , consists of an Ambassador and six accredited diplomats . 
For its part , The [LOC Bahamas  ] maintains a Consul General in [LOC Hong Kong  ] but has announced that , following [LOC PRC  ] suggestions , it will be establishing an embassy in [LOC Beijing  ] and closing its consulate in [LOC Hong Kong.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The largest [MISC Chinese  ] investment in The [LOC Bahamas  ] is the $1 billion [LOC Freeport  ] container port owned and operated by [MISC Hong Kong-based  ] Hutchison-Whampoa . 
[MISC Chinese  ] dignitaries traveling to the [LOC Bahamas  ] always visit [LOC Freeport  ] and the port . 
Hutchison-Whampoa employs only five [MISC Chinese  ] citizens in its [LOC Freeport  ] facility , all in a management capacity. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) Madam [PER Wu Yi  ] , State Councilor to the [LOC People’s Republic of China  ] accompanied by a delegation of 30 people , including six [MISC Chinese  ] business leaders , visited The [LOC Bahamas  ] in January 2003 . 
During her visit to [LOC Nassau  ] , Madam [PER Wu  ] presented the [MISC Bahamian  ] government with a grant of $250,000 for various technical , agricultural , handicraft and cooperative projects . 
Additionally , a delegation of [MISC Chinese  ] government officials visited [LOC Nassau  ] on June 19 , 2004 , to finalize plans for the [MISC Chinese  ] to grant the [MISC Bahamian  ] government $20 million for construction of a national stadium . 
COMMENT <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The [MISC Bahamas’  ] political and economic ties to [LOC China  ] remain modest . 
Bilateral trade flows have increased , reaching approximately $95 million for the first eight months of 2003 , and investment projects such as the [LOC Freeport  ] port facility are always welcome . 
Some local commentators would like to believe that The [LOC Bahamas  ] should attempt to use [LOC China  ] as a counter-balance to the [LOC U.S.  ] It is more likely , however , that [MISC Bahamian  ] officials are merely using their moment in the [MISC Chinese  ] spotlight to push for kinder [ORG WTO  ] accession terms ( at least as a starting point for negotiations with the other members ) and to pick up whatever spare trade and investment projects a country of over one billion people can offer . 
For their part , the [MISC Chinese  ] in The [LOC Bahamas  ] may be a strategic move preparing for a post-Castro [LOC Caribbean  ] .
