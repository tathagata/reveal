( C ) [LOC Brazil  ] has a close relationship with [LOC Cuba  ] and the [ORG GoB  ] does not publicly criticize the [PER Castro  ] regime 's human rights policies . 
During the last six months , President [PER Lula  ] and [MISC Cuban  ] President [PER Fidel Castro  ] have sparred publicly over [LOC Brazil  ] 's ethanol policy . 
[PER Castro  ] echoed [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Chavez  ] 's criticism of the USG-Brazil MOU to promote cooperation on development of ethanol production and use , arguing that using corn and sugar for fuel production would drive up food prices and starve the poor . 
President [PER Lula  ] used the [PER Isla Margarita Mercosul  ] energy summit to rebut that criticism , albeit in a low-key fashion , pointing out that production of [MISC Brazilian  ] sugar-cane based ethanol in [LOC Brazil  ] has increased dramatically without raising food prices . 
[PER Castro  ] also questioned labor conditions on [MISC Brazilian  ] sugar cane plantations. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) We know of no high level [ORG GoB  ] diplomatic visits to [LOC Cuba  ] during the last six months . 
[MISC Cuban  ] Vice Minister of [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] [PER Alejandro Gonzalez Galiano  ] visited [LOC Brasilia  ] in early March 2007 as part of a reportedly annual set of bilateral meetings between the ministries of foreign affairs .

( [ORG SBU  ] ) On the trade front , on July 20 , 2006 , [LOC Cuba  ] signed a free-trade agreement with the [MISC Mercosul  ] customs union , of which [LOC Brazil  ] is the largest member . 
The agreement makes multilateral all of [LOC Cuba  ] 's existing bilateral agreements with [MISC Mercosul  ] members , thus applying any trade preference granted to any [MISC Mercosul  ] member to all equally . 
The [ORG GoB  ] supported the [MISC Mercosul  ] agreement with [LOC Cuba  ] , which does not contemplate full [MISC Mercosul  ] membership for [LOC Cuba.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Bilateral [MISC Brazilian  ] trade with [LOC Cuba  ] grew to [MISC US$374.8  ] million in 2006 , up from [MISC US$284  ] million in 2005 . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] 2006 exports of [MISC US$343.3  ] million to [LOC Cuba  ] were led by exports of sugar , auto parts , beef , electrical equipment , chicken parts , and coffee .

[LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG National Development Bank  ] ( [ORG BNDES  ] ) provides trade finance lines to [MISC Brazilian  ] companies , including those trading with [LOC Cuba  ] .

Local accounts suggest that potential [ORG BNDES  ] export credits for [LOC Cuba  ] are under-utilized . 
5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The most recent [ORG Central Bank  ] data available on [MISC Brazilian  ] investments , for 2005 , show that [MISC Brazilian  ] companies invested [MISC US$21  ] million in [LOC Cuba  ] , up from [MISC US$19  ] million in 2004 .
