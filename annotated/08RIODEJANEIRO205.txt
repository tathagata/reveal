Introducing [ORG Petrobras  ] [PER Biocombustivel  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
[ORG Petrobras  ] is launching a biofuels subsidiary this week , [ORG Petrobras  ] [PER Biocombustivel  ] , to oversee over [MISC US$  ] 1.5 billion in new biofuels investments . 
[ORG Petrobras  ] [PER Biocombustivel  ] , headed by longtime [ORG Petrobras  ] insider [PER Alan Kardec Pinto  ] , will partner with foreign investors to buy minority stakes in ethanol projects in [LOC Brazil  ] and abroad , aiming at ensuring supplies for [ORG Petrobras  ] 's projected export supply contracts . 
Mines and Energy Minister [PER Edison Lobao  ] will be at the [ORG New York Stock Exchange  ] on August 18th to ring the closing belling as a means of announcing this new subsidiary . 
By 2012 , [ORG Petrobras  ] expects most of its ethanol exports will come from the mills where it holds minority stakes with an annual ethanol output of 1.3 billion gallons. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
[ORG Petrobras  ] [PER Biocombustivel  ] 's primary focus will be on ethanol and biodiesel production , as well as expansion of the company 's ethanol pipeline and storage facilities . 
It will also oversee three biodiesel plants that are scheduled to come on-line later in 2008 . 
The biodiesel plants , at a combined cost of [MISC US$188  ] million , will each produce 45 million gallons of biodiesel annually for domestic consumption . 
Snapshot of Petrobras' Current [ORG Biofuels Operations  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
[ORG Petrobras  ] is a strong player in ethanol transport ( Note: [ORG Petrobras  ] controls the country 's pipeline which is used for ethanol transportation ) and distribution in [LOC Brazil  ] 's domestic market , but it is not currently an ethanol producer . 
Through its distribution unit , [ORG Petrobras  ] Distribuidora , the company buys ethanol from [MISC Brazilian  ] sugar-cane refiners and sells it at its service stations either as pure ethanol or as part of its gasoline and diesel mixtures . 
( Note: By law , more than a fifth of all gasoline sold in [LOC Brazil  ] contains ethanol and ethanol just displaced gasoline as the major automotive fuel earlier this year . 
) [ORG Petrobras  ] stations currently sell over one-third of the ethanol used as fuel in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Since July 1 , 2008 , all diesel fuel in [LOC Brazil  ] contains 3 percent biodiesel ( supplied by [ORG Petrobras  ] ) . <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
In 2007 , [ORG Petrobras  ] exported about 210 million gallons of ethanol . 
Its only current ethanol export client is [ORG Petroleos de Venezuela  ] ( [ORG PDVSA  ] ) , [LOC Venezuela  ] 's state oil company . 
[ORG PDVSA  ] imports ethanol as a replacement for tetra-ethyl lead , a toxic gasoline additive . 
Outside of [LOC Venezuela  ] ( and potentially the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) , [ORG Petrobras  ] sees [LOC Japan  ] as a critical market for its expanded ethanol export strategy . 
In late 2007 , [ORG Petrobras  ] entered into its first five joint venture partnerships to produce ethanol in the states of [MISC Goias  ] and [ORG Mato Grosso  ] . 
In [ORG Petrobras  ] 's first partnership with [ORG Mitsui  ] , [LOC Japan  ] 's second-largest trading company , each company bought 10 percent of a mill that will start producing about 53 million gallons of ethanol annually in 2009 . 
Comment ------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
Despite Petrobras' bright ethanol exports forecast in the long term , this year 's overseas sales will fall short of its goal , due mainly to [LOC Venezuela  ] 's shift to an oil-based additive in gasoline instead of [MISC Brazilian  ] ethanol . 
[ORG Petrobras  ] may also fall short of its export targets as countries including [LOC Japan  ] , which the company counts on to buy most of its biofuels exports , delay plans for mandatory blending of ethanol into gasoline . 
A consulate contact described [ORG Petrobras  ] [PER Biocombustivel  ] as a " pet project " of the [LOC Lula  ] government driven primarily by the administration 's " obsession " with ethanol . 
[ORG Petrobras  ] is first and foremost an oil company , the source said , but the new subsidiary will at least serve to centralize the company 's biofuels activities - which , up to now , have been spread out over several divisions and will compete with many firms which specialize in biofuels. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 .
