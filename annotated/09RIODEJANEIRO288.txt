Reasons 1.4 ( b , d ) . 
SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) While the Government of [LOC Brazil  ] ( [ORG GOB  ] ) has yet to publicize its regulatory framework for the exploration of pre-salt reserves ( reftel ) , [ORG Petrobras  ] executives , petroleum industry representatives , and [ORG Rio de Janeiro-based  ] managers of [MISC American  ] oil firms have expressed concern over the main provisions of the reform package reported in the press . 
In reaction to the likelihood the new framework will mandate [ORG Petrobras  ] as the sole operator for all unlicensed blocks , Petrobr as and [ORG Brazilian Institute for Petroleum  ] executives argued the company does not have sufficient resources to effectively carry out this role , which could lead to subcontracting opportunities for other oil firms . 
While petroleum companies praised the concession model under the existing regime and opposed the likely shift to production sharing contracts ( [ORG PSC  ] ) , some analysts argued [ORG PSC  ] provisions could potentially carry fiscally advantageous terms for investors . 
The possibility of a new state company to own and administer all pre-salt reserves is anathema to industry representatives in [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] , although there appears to be a sound legal justification for such an entity . 
Local representatives of [ORG Chevron  ] and [ORG Exxon Mobile  ] are bracing for a far more challenging operating environment , but both companies will maintain an active presence in [LOC Brazil  ] , regardless of the changes the new reform package brings . 
End Summary . 
[ORG PETROBRAS  ] AS SOLE OPERATOR -------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In reaction to the widely-accepted perception that the new framework will mandate [ORG Petrobras  ] as the sole operator for all unlicensed blocks , [ORG Petrobras  ] and [ORG Brazilian Institute for Petroleum  ] ( [ORG IBP  ] ) executives in [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] contend the company does not have sufficient resources to effectively carry out this role . 
[PER Fernando Jose Cunha  ] , General Director of [ORG Petrobras  ] for [LOC Africa  ] , [LOC Asia  ] , and [LOC Euroasia  ] , told [ORG Rio Econoff  ] on Monday August 17 that such a provision , along with the strong likelihood [ORG Petrobras  ] will also be guaranteed at least a 30 percent share in every block , could deter potential investors and partners . 
[PER Alvaro Teixeira  ] , General Director for [ORG IBP  ] , an industry association that represents [ORG Petrobras  ] and other petroleum companies operating in [LOC Brazil  ] , called the proposal a " bad idea , " stating the [ORG GOB  ] would first have to recapitalize [ORG Petrobras  ] . 
According to [PER Gustavo Gattas  ] , a prominent energy analyst with [ORG UBS Pactual  ] , [ORG Petrobras'  ] lack of resources will likely lead to extensive cont racting for pre-salt exploration and production operations . 
He explained that some companies stand to benefit more than others from this model , explaining many IOCs and oil services company consider [ORG Petrobras  ] to be one of the " harshest " contractors in the world . 
" Some people are comfortable working with [ORG Petrobras  ] , others are not , " he explained. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Reaction by [ORG Rio de Janeiro-based  ] representatives of [MISC American  ] oil companies to the possibility of [ORG Petrobras  ] as the sole operator is mixed . 
[ORG Exxon Mobile  ] 's [ORG External Relations  ] Director [PER Carla Lacerda  ] , told [ORG Rio FCS  ] officer on August 10 the proposed model constituted a reversion to [LOC Brazil  ] 's former monopoly system . 
As the sole operator , she explained , [ORG Petrobras  ] would have more control over equipment purchases , personnel , and technology selection , which , in turn , could adversely affect [LOC U.S.  ] equipment and service supply to [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[ORG Chevron  ] 's Director for [ORG Business Development and Government Relations  ] [PER Patricia Pradal  ] told [ORG Rio Econoff  ] on Aug ust 21 that she had doubts over the legality of such a provision . 
" The [MISC Brazilian  ] government will have to fight this out in the courts or change the shareholder composition of [ORG Petrobras  ] to give the government a greater share , " she explained . 
In spite of that possibility , [PER Pradal  ] did not believe non-operating partner status would necessarily be bad for [ORG Chevron  ] . 
She stated , " We are trying to maintain a lower profile nowadays , " adding , " We area already partnering with [ORG RIO DE  ] JAN 00000288 002 OF 003 [ORG Petrobras  ] on five projects here . 
" MOVE FROM CONCESSION TO PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS --------------------------------------------- ---------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Although industry is opposed to the likely shift from concession to production sharing contracts ( [ORG PSCs  ] ) under the new regime , [ORG PSC  ] provisions could potentially carry fiscally advantageous terms for investors . 
[ORG IBP  ] 's [PER Teixeira  ] and [ORG Chevron  ] 's [PER Pradal  ] praised the concession model under the existing regime , calling it " strong and stable . 
" [PER Pradal  ] said the shift from such a model to a [ORG PSC  ] was a political move , explaining " Everything the [MISC Brazilian  ] government is trying to get from a [ORG PSC  ] , they could have done through concessions . 
" [ORG USB Pactual  ] 's [PER Gattas  ] offered a more favorable view on [ORG PSCs  ] , however , explaining the new model could erase the upfront cash payments associated with current concession contracts . 
The [MISC Tupi  ] field , for example , required an upfront payment of 15 million [MISC Brazilian  ] Reals ( 8 million USD ) . 
[PER Gattas  ] also explained that new provisions could possibly allow companies to recover a greater percentage of their investment within the first years of production . 
" A quick pay back under a [ORG PSC  ] can be very attractive to many IOCs , " he explained . 
FORMATION OF NEW STATE COMPANY ------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The likelihood of a new state company to own and administer all pre-salt reserves is anathema to industry representatives in [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] . 
[PER Petrobras' Cunha  ] stated [ORG Petrobras  ] never agreed with the concept of a new state company . 
With [ORG Petrobras  ] already at capacity , he did not know how such a company would receive its financial and human capital . 
" Will we be robbing [PER Peter  ] to pay [PER Paul  ] ? , " he asked rhetorically . 
[ORG Chevron  ] 's [PER Pradal  ] said the [ORG GOB  ] 's motivation for creating such a company was based on political jockeying , stating , " The [ORG PMDB  ] needs their own company . 
" ( [ORG Note:  ] The [ORG PMDB  ] , the government 's coalition partner , has reportedly been negotiating with President [ORG Lula  ] 's [ORG PT  ] party for seats on the board of such a company , in exchange for political concessions going into an election year . 
Energy Minister [PER Edison Lobao  ] , who is a leading [ORG PMDB  ] member , was a key proponent of the new state entity . 
End note ) . 
According to [ORG USB Pactual  ] 's [PER Gattas  ] , however , it makes legal sense for the [ORG GOB  ] to form a body to serve as a contract counterparty in court disputes and [ORG PCS  ] re-negotiations . 
" [ORG IBP  ] 's [PER Teixeira  ] said such a company will consist of less than 100 personnel , and would receive technical support from the Min istry of [ORG Mines and Energy  ] . 
UNITIZATION AND LOCAL CONTENT ----------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) There is mixed reaction over whether unitization and local content requirements will be included in the new framework . 
While some industry players have speculated the regulations will address unitization , a term of art in the petroleum industry for the process of distributing unlicensed blocks that share reservoirs with licensed blocks already under concession , [PER Nelson Narciso Filho  ] , Director for the [ORG Brazilian National Petroleum Regulatory Agency  ] ( [ORG ANP  ] ) stated the new regime will not address the unitization issue ( [ORG Note: ANP  ] is responsible for administering unitization . 
End Note ) . 
" We should not touch unitization until after the new regulations are in place , " he said . 
While the [ORG Ministry of Mines and Energy  ] Undersecretary for Oil , [ORG Natural Gas  ] , and [PER Renewables  ] told [ORG Brasilia Econoff  ] that the new regulations will provide for a flat local content requirement for all blocks ( reftel ) , as oppos ed to local content factoring into bidding criteria under the concession system , [ORG USB Pactual  ] 's [PER Gattas  ] doubted this would be the case . 
( [ORG Note: At  ] the July 20 CEO Forum , an attendee of Presidential Chief of Staff [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] 's meeting with the [MISC Brazilian  ] CEOs told [ORG Brasilia Econoff  ] that an increase in local content requirements would be part of the new pre-salt regulations . 
End Note ) . 
[PER Gattas  ] explained local content requirements are already too high for the [MISC Brazilian  ] equipment companies . 
" Everyone is fully contracted right now , " he stated , " And this could go overboard . 
" He argued such requirements would not be [ORG RIO DE  ] JAN 00000288 003 OF 003 addressed in the law , but rather handled through individual contracts , perhaps based on the precedence of the first [ORG PSC  ] to fall under the new framework . 
[MISC AMERICAN  ] OIL COMPANIES: 'WE WILL STAY' -------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Although [ORG Rio de Janeiro-based  ] representatives of [ORG Chevron  ] and [ORG Exxon Mobile  ] are bracing for a far more chal lenging operating environment , both companies will maintain an active presence in [LOC Brazil  ] , regardless of the changes the new reform package brings . 
According to [ORG Exxon Mobile  ] 's [PER Lacerda  ] , the [MISC Brazilian  ] market remains attractive , especially considering declining access to reserves , world wide . 
[ORG Chevron  ] 's [PER Padral  ] conceded her company will be " struggling " in the coming years , but said existing investments and her company 's long-term goals here will keep [ORG Chevron  ] engaged . 
" The rules can always improve later on , " she said . 
Both [PER Lacerda  ] and [PER Padral  ] stated their companies were accustomed to [ORG PSCs  ] world-wide and would enter into them here , given competitive and transparent terms . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Petroleum actors and insiders in [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] uniformly view the pre-salt reform as pre-election politicking by the [ORG Lula Administration  ] . 
Given the fact that the [ORG GOB  ] has not yet publicly released details of the new regulatory framework , however , industry is tempering its reaction to the actua l terms of the framework until after its announcement in [LOC Brasilia  ] on August 31 . 
Ultimately , the pace of production the [ORG GOB  ] subsequently sets for the pre-salt reserves could influence the [ORG IOC  ] 's ability to develop these fields more than the actual terms that govern how they do so. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Even once the announcement of the government 's vision of a new regulatory framework is made next week , it will still be a government proposal that needs the approval of the [ORG Congress  ] . 
Given the highly politicized nature of [ORG Congressional  ] debate as [LOC Brazil  ] anticipates the coming election year , a bill as important as this one will not face an easy road to approval . 
The final product will likely be substantially different than the details that have been leaked . 
For example , press reports varied leading up to the announcement , from Minister [PER Lobao  ] indicating that the distribution of royalties to states and municipalities will be omitted from the August 31 proposal so that the issue does not hold up pa ssage of the rest of the legislation , to other reports that the [ORG GOB  ] , under pressure from oil producing states , will in fact include royalties in the new framework , in a formulation closer to the current scheme . 
Such a decision which would almost certainly create disappointment and controversy among the non-oil producing states . 
Sources at the [ORG Ministry of Mines and Energy  ] confirm that it is still unclear how this issue will be handled vis-a-vis the August 31 announcement . 
While this element of the new regime is not one that has concerned industry thus far , it is clearly one of the biggest headaches for the government and likely to produce the toughest battles for the government . 
The fact that this very issue already prompted the delay of the previously planned August 19 announcement , and government consultations with affected state and local leaders in the interim do not appear to have brought them any closer to a resolution , is likely just a harbinger of the difficulties tha t lie ahead for this part of the new regulatory regime . 
Post will continue to closely monitor and report on developments .
