( C/NF ) Summary: [ORG EMIN  ] urged MOFA State Secretary [PER Fukuyama  ] and [ORG Fisheries Agency Deputy  ] Director General [PER Yamashita  ] to press [LOC Iceland  ] to lower its proposed quota for whaling in order to facilitate an overall agreement on whaling . 
Both [PER Fukuyama  ] and [PER Yamashita  ] said the GOJ is reluctant to take such action . 
[PER Fukuyama  ] cited a lack of desire to raise the profile of whaling to the political level , while [PER Yamashita  ] said [LOC Japan  ] could not use trade measures to stop the importation of whale meat from [LOC Finland  ] . 
[ORG EMIN  ] made the case that the parties are close to an agreement and [LOC Japan  ] should advise [LOC Iceland  ] to come to the table with a reasonable offer . 
[PER Yamashita  ] the [ORG Sea Shepherd  ] 's harassment of the [MISC Japanese  ] whaling fleet could limit domestic support for a compromise . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG EMIN  ] met MOFA State Secretary [PER Tetsuro Fukuyama  ] January 25 and [ORG Fisheries Agency of Japan Deputy  ] Director General Jun [PER Yamashita  ] January 26 to press the case for [LOC Japan  ] 's help in reaching out to [LOC Iceland  ] for cooperation in the current round of negotiations in the [ORG International Whaling Commission  ] ( [ORG IWC  ] ) . 
In his meeting with [PER Fukuyama  ] , [ORG EMIN  ] thanked [PER Fukuyama  ] for [LOC Japan  ] 's constructive engagement in the talks and asked for [LOC Japan  ] 's help to encourage [LOC Iceland  ] to reduce its proposed quota for whaling in the [LOC North Atlantic  ] . 
[PER Fukuyama  ] said he understands that [LOC Iceland  ] has taken a tough stance in the negotiations , but implied that his options are limited. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Fukuyama  ] said the whaling issue has not been a political issue in [LOC Japan  ] , a situation he would like to avoid . 
If the GOJ moves forward on the issue too quickly , he added , it will create a domestic political problem for the ruling [ORG Democratic Party of Japan  ] . 
He sees the situation as a Catch 22: it may not be possible to resolve the whaling issue without taking it to a political level , but doing so could create an adverse reaction for the [MISC DPJ.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG EMIN  ] replied that [LOC Iceland  ] 's proposed take of fin whales is predicated on exporting to [LOC Japan  ] , and its catch quota is far in excess of what the [MISC Japanese  ] market could absorb . 
If [LOC Japan  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] work to encourage both sides in the whaling debate to take reasonable approaches there will be an opportunity for a breakthrough . 
[PER Fukuyama  ] said that while his sense is that it will be difficult for [LOC Japan  ] to approach [LOC Iceland  ] , he will examine [LOC Iceland  ] 's position and the market for imported whale meat. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In his meeting with [ORG Fisheries Agency Deputy  ] Director General [PER Yamashita  ] , [ORG EMIN  ] again made the case for a GOJ intervention with [LOC Iceland  ] . 
[PER Yamashita  ] argued that trade measures against [LOC Iceland  ] are not appropriate since trade in whale meat between the two countries is not prohibited under either CITES or [ORG IWC  ] rules . 
( Note: [ORG EMIN  ] did not recommend [LOC Japan  ] take any measures to restrict trade . 
End note ) [ORG EMIN  ] countered that the issue at hand is concluding an agreement . 
A message from [LOC Japan  ] to [LOC Iceland  ] that its proposed catch far exceeds what the [MISC Japanese  ] market can absorb could bring them around . 
[PER Yamashita  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Japan  ] need to come up with other measures beside trade to influence [LOC Iceland  ] , but that he has no ideas at the moment . 
[PER Yamashita  ] was glad to hear of [LOC U.S  ] . 
" support " for [LOC Japan  ] 's proposal to reduce its catch . 
[ORG EMIN  ] said rather [LOC Japan  ] 's offer is something we can work with , and we would like to see the same out of [LOC Iceland.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) Turning to harassment of the [MISC Japanese  ] whaling fleet by the [ORG Sea Shepherd Conservation Society  ] ( [ORG SSCS  ] ) , [PER Yamashita  ] said the [ORG NGO  ] 's actions have kept the fleet from reaching its quota the last few years . 
[PER Yamashita  ] said the GOJ would come under pressure domestically if [ORG SSCS  ] harassment [LOC TOKYO  ] 00000171 002 OF 002 continues to keep [MISC Japanese  ] whalers from filling their quota after an agreement on reduced numbers is reached within the [ORG IWC  ] . 
[ORG EMIN  ] said the [ORG USG  ] is concerned about the safety of life at sea and is looking at the activity of the [ORG SSCS  ] .
