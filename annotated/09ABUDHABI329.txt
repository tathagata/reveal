( C ) Summary . 
The [MISC UAE’s  ] push ( refs [MISC A-C  ] ) to host the headquarters of the [ORG International Renewable Energy Agency  ] ( [ORG IRENA  ] ) complements its political and financial commitment to encouraging renewable energy production and consumption . 
Although the fourth largest oil producer in the world , the [LOC UAE  ] is expanding its commitment to environmental protection , and more importantly , positioning itself for what it sees as a post-hydrocarbon based future . 
The [LOC UAE  ] has launched a major effort to promote renewables by encouraging research , development and innovation in the [LOC UAE  ] and abroad . 
This includes an ambitious effort to build the first zero-carbon , zero-waste city , [LOC Masdar City  ] . 
The [LOC UAE  ] has serious resources to put into the international search for alternative energy sources , and as such , [LOC UAE  ] interest in these issues should be seen as an opportunity for the [ORG USG  ] . 
Moreover , the [LOC UAE  ] is clearly signaling that it wants [LOC United States  ] to support its [ORG IRENA  ] bid , given [LOC UAE  ] support for many of our political , security and financial priorities and the [MISC Administration’s  ] focus on environmental issues . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Since the creation of [ORG IRENA  ] in January , the [LOC UAE  ] has actively campaigned to host the headquarters in [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] . 
Though the argument that an oil producer should host a renewable energy agency may seem counter-intuitive , Emiratis view [ORG IRENA  ] as a natural complement to their efforts to protect the environment and reduce [LOC UAE  ] dependence on fossil fuels . 
The founder of the [LOC UAE  ] Sheikh [PER Zayed  ] is widely known in the [LOC UAE  ] as one of the [MISC Arab  ] world’s first environmentalists , and the new generation of leaders is advancing his efforts through the application of modern environmental technology , policies and practices. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The most prominent example of [LOC UAE  ] commitment is [PER Masdar  ] ( www.masdar.ae ) , the [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] Future Energy Company , which was launched in 2006 as part of [LOC Abu Dhabi’s  ] efforts to diversify its economy away from petroleum , while leveraging its historic expertise in global energy markets . 
[LOC Masdar  ] has established the [ORG Masdar Institute for Science and Technology  ] ( [ORG MIST  ] ) , in collaboration with [MISC MIT  ] , to support graduate level research on advanced energy and sustainability , begun construction on the world’s first zero-carbon , zero-waste city ( [LOC Masdar City  ] ) , and launched the [ORG World Future Energy Summit  ] and the [ORG Zayed Future Energy Prize  ] . 
Putting [LOC UAE  ] money where its mouth is , [PER Masdar  ] has also invested over [ORG USD  ] 1 billion in foreign wind and solar technology projects , including [ORG Torresol Energy  ] ( [LOC Spain  ] ) , [PER WinWinD  ] ( [LOC Finland  ] ) and the [LOC London  ] Array offshore wind farm ( [LOC UK  ] ) , among others . 
Domestically , [LOC Masdar  ] is developing solar production capacity and working with the [ORG Abu Dhabi National Oil Company  ] ( [ORG ADNOC  ] ) on carbon capture and reinjection into oil fields . 
Masdar’s efforts will help the [LOC Emirate  ] of [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] reach a target of 7 percent power generation from renewables by 2020. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG UAEG  ] wants [LOC Masdar City  ] to be the host of [ORG IRENA  ] , but its argument is based on more than just Masdar’s credentials . 
Officials note the important symbolism of putting an international renewable agency in an oil-producing country . 
They also highlight that no other international organizations are headquartered in the [LOC Arab World  ] , with the exception of [ORG UNRWA  ] , which they view as an aid organization more than a policy body ( and one that they hope can eventually disappear as a two-state solution materializes ) . 
Further , the [LOC UAE  ] is centrally located between developed and developing nations and bridges north-south , east-west divides. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) COMMENT: Whether the [ORG USG  ] can support the [ORG IRENA  ] candidacy of the [LOC UAE  ] ultimately depends on [ORG USG  ] policy toward [ORG IRENA  ] itself , and we do not have the overall context for a policy recommendation on that issue . 
However , several points about the [LOC UAE  ] position need to be factored into such a policy decision: -- First: The [LOC UAE  ] , unlike many supporters of renewables , has serious resources to put into the development of technology . 
This is a point that has not been lost on the [LOC US  ] and other countries private sectors who have worn a deep path to Masdar’s door seeking participation in its projects . 
-- Second: The [LOC UAE  ] has been one of our most helpful security partners in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
[LOC UAE  ] troops are in the fight in [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( in greater numbers and more dangerous places than many [ORG NATO  ] Allies ) ; the [LOC UAE  ] has cancelled [LOC Saddam  ] era debt in [LOC Iraq  ] and opened an Embassy ; it is perhaps the only [MISC Arab  ] country to have fully paid up its dues to the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] ; and it has taken a leading role in the Friends of [LOC Pakistan  ] initiative . 
While the [LOC UAE  ] ABU DHABI 00000329 002 OF 002 has not expressed any direct linkage between any of these initiatives and [ORG IRENA  ] , it has clearly signaled that , having been helpful to the [ORG USG  ] on a number of issues important to us , it expects the [ORG USG  ] to be helpful on an issue of importance to the [LOC UAE.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) UAE Foreign Minister [PER Abdullah bin Zayid Al-Nahyan  ] ( AbZ ) will raise this issue with Secretary [PER Clinton  ] during their 7 April meeting .
