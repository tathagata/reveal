( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The Ambassador met with Vice President [PER Francisco Santos  ] and [ORG Administrative Department of Security  ] ( [ORG DAS  ] ) Director [PER Felipe Munoz  ] on September 15 to discuss [ORG DAS  ] wiretapping scandals ( reftel ) .

He stressed the need to investigate fully and to proactively address public perception . 
VP [PER Santos  ] had already reached the same conclusions , and even included dissolving the [ORG DAS  ] as an option . 
Going forward , the [ORG GOC  ] plans to expeditiously transfer the [MISC DAS'  ] judicial responsibilities to other agencies , publicly ask an international body ( e.g. , [ORG Interpol  ] ) to launch an in-depth investigation , and enlist outside intelligence experts to prepare a roadmap for restructuring [ORG DAS  ] and its intel function . 
The [ORG GOC  ] will also consider asking a respected , independent foreign dignitary ( such as a former head of state ) to lead these investigation and reorganization efforts . 
[PER Munoz  ] hopes to reschedule his canceled travel to [LOC Washington  ] to provide explanations to the [ORG State Department  ] and the [ORG U.S. Congress  ] . 
End Summary . 
THE [ORG USG  ] IS VERY CONCERNED ------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The Ambassador noted continued scandals and leaks from [ORG DAS  ] , suggesting illicit and unlawful activity . 
The [ORG GOC  ] has been unable to publicly get out in front of the scandals . 
He said the [ORG USG  ] was close to severing all relations with the [ORG DAS  ] , and informed Vice President [PER Santos  ] that he had instructed the [ORG Embassy  ] 's intelligence and law enforcement agencies to be ready to transfer cooperation and support to other [ORG GOC  ] entities . 
The Ambassador stressed the need to investigate the scandals fully and transparently , and to publicize investigation and restructuring efforts . 
VP UNDERSTANDS SITUATION IS DIRE , WANTS TO KNOW WHO IS BEHIND ATTACKS ----------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) VP [PER Santos  ] had already reached the same conclusions and noted that the remarks by the [ORG State Department  ] spokesperson were strong . 
He said the [ORG GOC  ] wanted full investigations and justice , and that any additional scandals would likely force the [ORG GOC  ] to close [ORG DAS  ] ( closure would have to be approved by [ORG Congress  ] ) . 
He called the [LOC DAS'  ] troubles a clear victory for criminals , as [ORG DAS  ] operations are frozen and surveillance equipment is under lock and key . 
He noted that the [ORG DAS  ] has had a series of corruption problems and surveillance scandals over the past decades , but assured the Ambassador that no officially-sanctioned illegal surveillance has occurred since former [ORG DAS  ] director [PER Jorge Noguera  ] was fired in November 2007. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) VP [PER Santos  ] repeatedly stated that he felt an external or internal anti-Uribe force --Venezuelan President [PER Hugo Chavez  ] , [ORG Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia  ] ( [ORG FARC  ] ) , narcotraffickers , the [MISC Cuban  ] government , corrupt [ORG DAS  ] employees , or political opposition parties-- was behind the attacks on the [ORG DAS  ] . 
He said this " very dark force " knows it can use the [ORG USG  ] and [ORG Congress  ] ( he named a [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Senator  ] ) as a pressure point , and feared that Police Intelligence ( [ORG DIPOL  ] ) could be its next target . 
VP [PER Santos  ] asked for [ORG USG  ] help in identifying those responsible . 
ACCELERATING [ORG DAS  ] RESTRUCTURING ------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Munoz  ] described plans to restructure [ORG DAS  ] , transferring its judicial components to other [ORG GOC  ] entities and slashing staff within the next 60 days . 
[ORG VP Santos  ] responded by instructing him to accelerate the process and to do as much as possible within the next week . 
The [ORG Prosecutor General 's Office  ] ( [ORG Fiscalia  ] ) must be involved in the transfer of about 100 pending cases , some of which must remain in [ORG DAS  ] for trial and legal reasons . 
[PER Munoz  ] will work with prosecutors and [ORG USG  ] agencies to immediately transfer as many cases as possible . 
[PER Munoz  ] said that the cases may be transferred to the [ORG CTI  ] ( the investigative unit of the [ORG Prosecutor General  ] ) as an interim measure. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The Ambassador said the [ORG GOC  ] better have a Plan [PER B. If  ] another [ORG DAS  ] scandal erupted , our Plan B was to terminate all association with [ORG DAS  ] . 
Immediately . 
PUBLICLY ENLISTING INDEPENDENT HELP ----------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Taking the Ambassador 's advice into account , [ORG VP Santos  ] said the [ORG GOC  ] would seek to announce by September 21 that it was requesting an international body ( e.g. , [ORG Interpol  ] or the [ORG OAS  ] ) to launch an in-depth investigation into the [ORG DAS  ] scandals . 
[ORG VP Santos  ] is keen to have [ORG FBI  ] involvement in the investigation , but the Ambassador warned that any [ORG USG  ] participation must be under the umbrella of an international body , and even then we would be very hesitant to participate . 
The Ambassador stressed that the investigation must have full access and authority. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG VP Santos  ] said the [ORG GOC  ] would seek the help of several non-DAS intel experts ( either from other countries or perhaps retired [MISC Colombians  ] ) to embed themselves in the [ORG DAS  ] and develop a roadmap for restructuring the [ORG DAS  ] intel function . 
He was initially leaning towards the [ORG CIA  ] , [ORG Scotland Yard  ] and [ORG MI-6  ] , but wondered if those entities would accept a public profile . 
Ambassador was very skeptical about [ORG USG  ] participation. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Finally , the [ORG GOC  ] will consider asking a respected , independent foreign dignitary ( such as a former head of state ) to lead these investigation and reorganization efforts . 
[ORG VP Santos  ] was considering both regional and global options , which he 'd have to clear with President [PER Uribe  ] . 
Some of the countries and individuals listed in the initial brainstorm were: [PER Ricardo Lagos  ] ( [LOC Chile  ] ) , [PER Vicente Fox  ] ( [LOC Mexico  ] ) , [PER Fernando Henrique Cardoso  ] ( [LOC Brazil  ] ) , [LOC Australia  ] , [LOC India  ] , and even [LOC Russia  ] or [LOC Cuba  ] . 
The Ambassador pursed his lips severely at the last two . 
[ORG AMBASSADOR  ] TO ENGAGE URIBE DIRECTLY ----------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG VP Santos  ] noted that President [PER Uribe  ] did not fully understand the depth of the crisis , and recommended that the Ambassador raise the gravity of the situation and ideas on the way forward directly with [PER Uribe  ] . 
The Ambassador agreed to have that conversation at the earliest opportunity . 
RECORDING OF EMBASSY OFFICIAL: IT WASN'T [ORG DAS  ] ! --------------------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Turning to the leaked wiretap of a conversation between a magistrate and an [ORG Embassy  ] official ( reftel ) , [ORG VP Santos  ] and [PER Munoz  ] said the [ORG GOC  ] 's investigation showed that the recording was done by an outsider . 
They assured the Ambassador that [ORG DAS  ] equipment ( both fixed and mobile ) could not have been used , and said an independent [MISC Russian  ] surveillance expert had studied the matter and reached the same conclusion . 
[ORG VP Santos  ] said the recording could have been done by anyone , including a disgruntled [ORG DAS  ] employee . 
The Ambassador said that the [ORG Embassy  ] 's investigation also concluded that [ORG DAS  ] equipment was probably not used . 
THE NEXT SCANDAL ? ----------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) News magazine [ORG Semana  ] has received another , not-yet-public leak involving [ORG USG  ] intel support for [ORG DAS  ] and [LOC Ecuador  ] 's ties with the [ORG FARC  ] . 
[ORG VP Santos  ] said that Foreign Minister [PER Bermudez  ] had already spoken to the [MISC Ecuadorian  ] FM in case the story breaks . 
Although the [ORG GOC  ] has asked [ORG Semana  ] to refrain from publishing the story for national security reasons , [ORG VP Santos  ] thinks it will become public . 
[PER Munoz  ] noted that the employee who leaked the information was undergoing polygraph testing , and would hopefully be prosecuted quickly . 
The Ambassador pointed out that he would likely again have to answer difficult media questions . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Santos  ] himself said [ORG DAS  ] may be in its death throes . 
He may be right . 
The price to restore its public credibility may be higher than the [ORG GOC  ] is prepared to pay .
