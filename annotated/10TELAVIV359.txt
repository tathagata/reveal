Cunningham  ] ; reasons 1.4 b/d <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C/NF ) Ambassador had a wide-ranging discussion with Gen. [PER Eitan Dangot  ] , [ORG Coordinator of Government Activity  ] in the [MISC Territories  ] ( COGAT ) on February 16 in which he urged movement on various aspects of [LOC West Bank  ] and [LOC Gaza  ] issues . 
[PER Dangot  ] said he expected the [ORG GOI  ] to authorize on February 18 transfer of as much as 300 million surplus shekels from the [LOC Gaza  ] banks back into [LOC Israel  ] . 
If approved , actual transfer should take place within a matter of days . 
He was more negative on transfers of dollars , noting that the [ORG GOI  ] was allowing in $30 million a month for [MISC UNWRA  ] operations and salaries . 
However , the [ORG GOI  ] would be reluctant to do anything that would make it easier for [ORG Hamas  ] to pay its salaries in hard currency or to support the tunnel economy . 
The Ambassador argued that the transfers were important to preserve the [MISC PA-regulated  ] banking system , and noted that we understood the security services had prepared an options paper for the Prime Minister 's Office which we looked forward to discussing . 
[PER Dangot  ] reiterated the [ORG GOI  ] view that the economic embargo was putting pressure on the [ORG Hamas  ] leadership in [LOC Gaza  ] , as were [MISC Egyptian  ] travel restrictions on [ORG Hamas  ] leaders . 
[PER Dangot  ] said the [ORG GOI  ] had not given up on negotiating the release of [PER Gilad Shalit  ] , even though the [MISC Damascus-based  ] [ORG Hamas  ] leadership had forced the [MISC Gazan  ] leaderhip to be less pragmatic for the moment . 
Noting that the [ORG GOI  ] had recently expanded the categories and amount of goods going into [LOC Gaza  ] , [PER Dangot  ] added that he was looking at what more could be done within the current policy constraints , particularly with one-off , containable infrastructure projects . 
He said that he would be meeting again with UNSCO [PER Robert Serry  ] the week of February 22 to get a few of the [ORG UN  ] projects moving forward , adding that he also expected to be doing more with [ORG USAID  ] in this area . 
The Ambassador noted we were still interested in pursuing the [ORG UN  ] reconstruction projects , and that we had worked with the [ORG UN  ] to create end-use assurances that should be satisfactory for [LOC Israel  ] . 
He also pointed to the commitment that Serry had made to ensure that the [ORG PA  ] got maximum credit for [MISC UN-funded  ] projects in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
[PER Dangot  ] agreed that the [ORG PA  ] role was important , and said he was coordinating carefully with the [ORG PA  ] on [LOC Gaza  ] . 
The Ambassador expressed interest in setting up a bilateral policy dialogue on [LOC Gaza  ] that would look at not only short-term humanitarian issues , but could also assess how best to achieve shared objectives in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
[PER Dangot  ] thought this would be worthwhile and committed to participating in such a dialogue. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Dangot  ] said he had met with [ORG PA  ] Prime Minister [PER Fayyad  ] earlier in the week . 
He said [PER Fayyad  ] had raised with him a plan to ask the [MISC Egyptians  ] to allow [ORG PA  ] customs and security officials to operate on the [MISC Egyptian  ] side of the [LOC Rafah  ] crossing into [LOC Gaza  ] , which [PER Dangot  ] told [PER Fayyad  ] would be a mistake . 
The Ambassador noted that the [MISC Egyptians  ] also might not find the proposal in their interest . 
[PER Dangot  ] characterized [PER Fayyad  ] as gaining in political confidence and grass roots popularity , though he warned that current anti-Israel rhetoric in the [ORG PA  ] was creating an atmosphere for renewed violence , noting the recent killings of a rabbi and an [MISC IDF  ] soldier . 
[PER Dangot  ] also raised concern that [ORG PA  ] Minister of Justice [PER Ali Khashan  ] was once again engaging the [ORG International Criminal Court  ] in an effort to delegitimize [LOC Israel  ] , noting that this would certainly prompt a [ORG GOI  ] reaction ( others have raised this with us recently , warning the [ORG PA  ] re-engagement with the [ORG ICC  ] will be seen very negatively ) . 
[PER Dangot  ] added that he hoped movement toward negotiations would begin before the March 27-28 [ORG Arab League  ] summit in [LOC Libya  ] . 
[PER Dangot  ] said that [LOC Libya  ] had agreed not to allow [ORG Hamas  ] to take part in the [LOC Summit  ] , under pressure from [MISC Egyptian  ] President [PER Mubarak  ] , but worried that this could change between now and the end of [ORG March.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) On [LOC West Bank  ] issues , [PER Dangot  ] said the security situation remained good and cooperation with the [ORG PASF  ] was better than it had ever been . 
However , the uptick in hostile political rhetoric and staging of " spontaneous " demonstrations -- often , in his view , in areas where there were no particular problems between the [MISC Israelis  ] and the local population , but which were close enough to [LOC Ramallah  ] to be convenient for [ORG PA  ] leadership to participate were of growing concern . 
At minimum , these activities made it more difficult for the [ORG IDF  ] to cut back on [MISC Area A  ] incursions and to further reduce movement and access impediments , said [PER Dangot  ] , and at worst , blurred the distinction between [PER Fatah  ] and [ORG Hamas  ] or other terror groups contending for the [LOC West Bank  ] " prize . 
" [PER Dangot  ] also complained that burning [MISC Israeli  ] settlement goods in a public bonfire in [LOC Salfit  ] and the expansion of the trade boycott to include products from [MISC Green Line Israel  ] sent wrong [ORG TEL AVIV  ] 00000359 002 OF 002 signals to both the [MISC Palestinian  ] and [MISC Israeli  ] populations. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Dangot  ] said [PER Fayyad  ] 's focus on short-term projects that yield rapid results was having an impact on the [LOC West Bank  ] economy , citing his willingness to pull the plug on an ineffective [MISC Palestinian  ] effort to invest in the [LOC Jenin  ] area and turn the project over to a [MISC Turkish  ] investor with a good track record . 
He said the [LOC Rawabi  ] project would be another big shot in the arm for the [LOC West Bank  ] . 
He noted that the Prime Minister 's Office had not yet agreed to redesignate land from [LOC Area C  ] to [LOC Area B  ] for the 2.4 kilometer main access road , but added that [ORG COGAT  ] was looking to be helpful in any other way that it could . 
On [LOC Wataniya  ] , [PER Dangot  ] said that the [ORG GOI  ] intended to withhold the remaining 1.0 MHz of bandwidth in an effort to force the [ORG PA  ] to begin regulating illicit radio stations . 
He said 78 radio stations had sprung up in the [LOC West Bank  ] over the past couple of years , many of which were operating in frequencies that interfered with [MISC Israeli  ] military or civilian aviation signals . 
[PER Dangot  ] said the [ORG GOI  ] would soon extend operating hours at the [LOC Shar Ephraim  ] crossing , as they had done at the [LOC Tarqumiyah  ] crossing , which should allow more [MISC Palestinian  ] goods to be moved at lower cost . 
He said the [MISC IDF  ] continues to move or remove roadblocks and to encourage investment. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) In response to the Ambassador 's question , [PER Dangot  ] said [ORG COGAT  ] would do all it could to make the May 2010 [ORG Bethlehem Investment Conference  ] a success . 
The Ambassador raised NGO and foreign investor visas problems , noting this was a serious problem for the [LOC US  ] and was undercutting the capacity building effort . 
[PER Dangot  ] said " We are hurting ourselves with these policies . 
" He said he had had some difficulty in getting the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] to discuss the problems with him , but had finally set up a meeting with Minister [PER Yishai  ] during the first week of March . 
The Ambassador informed [PER Dangot  ] that we were also pushing the [ORG MOI  ] , and that the [ORG USG  ] had some thoughts on how to deal with the various visa and access problems . 
[PER Dangot  ] asked that Emboffs brief his staff before the March meeting with [ORG MOI  ] ( NOTE: Embassy will give [ORG COGAT  ] a copy of the non-paper and recommendations ; we have also passed a copy to [PER Eran Lerman  ] in the Prime Minister 's Office . 
END NOTE . 
) The Ambassador suggested that USAID/SEMEP/Emboffs also brief [PER Dangot  ] on the work [ORG USAID  ] had done on prospects for a " known-trader " secure supply chain program , which could also give a boost to [LOC West Bank  ] agriculture and industry . 
[PER Dangot  ] said it sounded interesting and he would welcome the briefing . 
The Ambassador pointed out that [MISC Israeli  ] restrictions on dual use items are another serious impediment . 
[PER Dangot  ] confirmed that dual-use imports continue to be a problem for both [MISC Israeli  ] security and [MISC Palestinian  ] industry , and applauded Embassy efforts to work directly with the various security services who make recommendations on dual-use items. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) Comment: [PER Dangot  ] is clearly a different sort of [ORG COGAT  ] than we have dealt with in recent years . 
He has claimed ( and the [ORG MOD PolMil Bureau  ] has now grudgingly confirmed ) that he will play a lead role in policy issues related to [MISC Israel-Palestinian  ] relations . 
The concerns he raised about [ORG PA  ] incitement are becoming a common theme from [ORG GOI  ] officials and [MISC Israeli  ] analysts of [MISC Palestinian  ] politics alike .
