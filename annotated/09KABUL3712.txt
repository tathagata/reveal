( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: The [ORG Afghan Judicial Security Unit  ] ( [ORG JSU  ] ) is closer to becoming operational within [LOC Kabul  ] . 
The [ORG U.S. Marshals Service  ] ( [ORG USMS  ] ) has completed a security assessment of the [ORG Supreme Court  ] and determined the number of [ORG JSU  ] officers needed to secure the [ORG Counter-Narcotics Justice Center  ] ( [ORG CNJC  ] ) and the [ORG Afghan Supreme Court  ] . 
Training is ongoing for unit members assigned to protect the [ORG CNJC  ] . 
The [ORG USMS  ] is developing planning documents and identifying immediate resource needs as well as possible funding sources to enable the [ORG JSU  ] grow to accomplish the larger judicial security mission described below . 
As previously reported Ref A , strong [ORG USG  ] support and significant funding is needed to fully implement this important [MISC Anti-Corruption/Rule  ] of Law initiative . 
Post will outline specific requests for funding and material support in a future cable once Post completes a [ORG JSU  ] mission and resource requirement analysis . 
As a judge assigned to the [ORG CNJC  ] commented to a [ORG DOJ  ] mentor: good judicial decisions are directly linked to good security . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) With the completion of a preliminary security needs assessment for the [ORG Afghan Supreme Court  ] and development of a list of needed security upgrades and equipment , the [ORG U.S. Marshals Service  ] ( [ORG USMS  ] ) and [ORG Department of Justice  ] ( [ORG DOJ  ] ) , with support from [ORG INL  ] , is moving forward with standing up the [ORG Afghan Judicial Security Unit  ] ( [ORG JSU  ] ) . 
[ORG INL  ] provided furniture , fixtures , and equipment valued at approximately $125,000 for the [ORG JSU  ] housing compound , located next to the [ORG CNJC  ] . 
Approximately 80% of the furniture was delivered and assembled during the last week of October . 
The remaining furniture is expected by mid-November . 
[ORG INL  ] agreed to provide approximately $2.1 million annually for O&M funding for the housing compound for the next two years with a target start date of November 24 . 
The [MISC French  ] government provided initial protective services training to the current 54 members of the [ORG JSU  ] , and will continue to do so as the [ORG JSU  ] grows over time until the unit is fully manned and trained . 
Current [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG JSU  ] officers , with guidance from the [ORG USMS  ] , are providing firearms training for all [ORG CNJC  ] judges . 
[ORG Ministry of Interior Deputy Minister  ] for Security Mangal and Deputy Minister for [PER Counternarcotics Daoud  ] support moving the [ORG JSU  ] from [PER Counternarcotics  ] to the Special Operations Police Detachment supervised by DM [PER Mangal.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) The [ORG USMS  ] performed a preliminary assessment and estimated the minimum number of [ORG JSU  ] officers needed to secure key judicial institutions in [LOC Kabul  ] , namely the [ORG CNJC  ] , the [ORG Supreme Court  ] , and the [MISC Major Crimes Task Force  ] compound ( the total number will range from 245 to 760 , depending on whether the judges are housed in compounds , or whether the [ORG JSU  ] is directed to provide 24/7 personal protection ) . 
As a limited number of regional courts are identified to try anti-corruption and low-level insurgent cases , the [ORG USMS  ] , together with [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG JSU  ] officers , will conduct additional assessments to determine the security needs of judges working there . 
These assessments will , in part , form the basis to request phased growth of the [ORG JSU  ] . 
Action officer level discussions with [MISC CSTC-A  ] indicate that any [ORG JSU  ] growth must fit within the [ORG ANP  ] growth plan currently under evaluation by the [ORG International Community  ] ( i.e. grow the [ORG ANP  ] to a 160,000 person force by 2013 ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Post has identified the following actions necessary to advance and sustain the [ORG JSU  ] initiative: ( 1 ) Obtain MOI and [ORG Supreme Court  ] approval of the proposed multi-phased roll-out of the [ORG JSU  ] expansion , and manage [MISC Afghan  ] expectations of the size of the [ORG JSU  ] force ; ( 2 ) obtain approval from and [LOC U.S.  ] and other donors for funding for additional housing for the enlarged [ORG JSU  ] force ; and ( 3 ) identify a location and [LOC U.S.  ] or other funding for a [ORG Judicial Security Unit  ] training facility. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Post is also supporting MOI in its efforts to prepare documentation that: ( 1 ) immediately reassigns the 100 police officers designated by DM Mangal in August to the [ORG JSU  ] forming a single unit under his command ; ( 2 ) officially defines the [ORG JSU  ] mission and authorizes [ORG JSU  ] officers to wear appropriate civilian attire , i.e. , plain clothes ; and ( 3 ) changes the Tashkil ( [MISC Afghan  ] unit manning and equipment document ) to place the [ORG JSU  ] under the direct supervision of the Deputy Minister for Security and to provide the [ORG JSU  ] with nationwide investigative authority , which is necessary for threat and fugitive investigations. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) Finally , Post has identified the following immediate resource needs: armored vehicles ( for which [ORG INL  ] has set aside $1.5 million ) , magnetometers , communications equipment , uniforms , including winter gear and plain clothes , and security upgrades for the [ORG CNJC  ] , including a paved road . 
In addition to utilizing [ORG INL  ] funding , the [ORG Embassy  ] is exploring the possibility of obtaining funding for this equipment from other sources , including [MISC CSTC-A  ] and international partners such as the [LOC UK.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: Post will continue to engage with [MISC Afghan  ] and [LOC KABUL  ] 00003712 002 OF 002 international partners to define the scope of the [ORG JSU  ] , and to identify both immediate and long term sustainment needs and funding sources for both . 
Once mission analysis and resource requirements are finalized , Post will outline specific unfulfilled requests for funding and material support via cable . 
The [ORG JSU  ] is designed to build an effective security unit that will protect facilities , judges and at-risk prosecutors and witnesses . 
It is a vital component of our [MISC Anti-Corruption  ] and Rule-of-Law efforts .
