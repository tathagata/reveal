Reason: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: [LOC Moscow  ] Mayor [PER Yuriy Luzhkov  ] remains a loyal member of [ORG United Russia  ] , with a reputation for ensuring that the city has the resources it needs to function smoothly . 
Questions increasingly arise regarding [PER Luzhkov  ] 's connections to the criminal world and the impact of these ties on governance . 
[PER Luzhkov  ] remains in a solid position due to his value as a consistent deliverer of votes for the ruling party . 
Unfortunately , the shadowy world of corrupt business practices under [PER Luzhkov  ] continues in [LOC Moscow  ] , with corrupt officials requiring bribes from businesses attempting to operate in the city . 
End Summary . 
Overview: The [LOC Kremlin  ] 's [PER Luzhkov Dilemma  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [LOC Moscow  ] Mayor [PER Yuriy Luzhkov  ] is the embodiment of political dilemma for the [LOC Kremlin  ] . 
A loyal , founding member of [ORG United Russia  ] and a trusted deliverer of votes and influence for the ruling party and its leader , Prime Minister [PER Putin  ] , [PER Luzhkov  ] 's connections to [LOC Moscow  ] 's business community -- the big and legitimate as well as the marginal and corrupt -- has enabled him to call for support when he needs it , to deliver votes for [ORG United Russia  ] , or to ensure that the city has the resources it needs to function smoothly . 
[PER Luzhkov  ] 's national reputation as the man who governs the ungovernable , who cleans the streets , keeps the [ORG Metro  ] running and maintains order in [LOC Europe  ] 's largest metropolis of almost 11 million people , earns him a certain amount of slack from government and party leaders . 
He oversaw what even [ORG United Russia  ] insiders acknowledge was a dirty , compromised election for the [LOC Moscow City  ] Duma in October , and yet received only a slap on the wrist from President [PER Medvedev.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Muscovites are increasingly questioning the standard operating procedures of their chief executive , a man who , as of 2007 , they no longer directly elect . 
[PER Luzhkov  ] 's connections to the criminal world and the impact that these ties have had on governance and development in [LOC Moscow  ] are increasingly a matter of public discussion . 
Although [PER Luzhkov  ] was successful in winning court-ordered damages from opposition leader [PER Boris Nemtsov  ] for his recent publication " [MISC Luzhkov: An Accounting  ] , " [PER Nemtsov  ] and his Solidarity-movement allies were heartened by the fact that the judge did not award damages on the basis of the corruption accusations themselves , but rather on a libel technicality. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Few believe that [PER Luzhkov  ] will voluntarily relinquish his post prior to 2012 , when the [ORG Moscow City  ] Duma must submit a list of mayoral candidates to [PER Medvedev  ] for his selection . 
[ORG United Russia  ] will probably call on [PER Luzhkov  ] 's political machine and his genuine public support to deliver votes for them in the 2011 State Duma elections , as well as the 2012 Presidential contest . 
With no apparent successor in line , and with no ambitions beyond remaining mayor , [PER Luzhkov  ] is in a solid position . 
The evidence of his involvement -- or at least association -- with corruption remains significant . 
This cable presents that side of [PER Luzhkov  ] -- one that bears not only on [PER Luzhkov  ] and his handling of local politics , but on [PER Putin  ] and [PER Medvedev  ] as they move toward the 2012 elections . 
Background on [LOC Moscow  ] 's Criminal World ------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [LOC Moscow  ] city government 's direct links to criminality have led some to call it " dysfunctional , " and to assert that the government operates more as a kleptocracy than a government . 
Criminal elements enjoy a " krysha " ( a term from the criminal/mafia world literally meaning " roof " or protection ) that runs through the police , the [ORG Federal Security Service  ] ( [ORG FSB  ] ) , [ORG Ministry of Internal Affairs  ] ( [ORG MVD  ] ) , and the prosecutor 's office , as well as throughout the [LOC Moscow  ] city government bureaucracy . 
Analysts identify a three-tiered structure in [LOC Moscow  ] 's criminal world . 
[PER Luzhkov  ] is at the top . 
The [ORG FSB  ] , [ORG MVD  ] , and militia are at the second level . 
Finally , ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level . 
This is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill a void in some areas because the city is not providing some services. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , told us that [LOC Moscow  ] 's ethnic criminal groups do business and give paybacks . 
It is the federal headquarters of the parties , not the criminal groups , who decide who will participate in politics . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] argued that the political parties are the ones with the political clout ; therefore , they have some power over these criminal groups . 
[LOC MOSCOW  ] 00000317 002 OF 003 Crime groups work with municipal bureaucrats , but at a low level . 
For example , the [MISC Armenians  ] and [MISC Georgians  ] were formerly heavily involved in the gambling business before city officials closed the gambling facilities . 
These ethnic groups needed protection from law enforcement crackdowns , so they sought cooperation with the municipal bureaucrats . 
In such scenarios , crime groups paid the [LOC Moscow  ] police for protection . 
[PER Luzhkov  ] 's Links to Criminal Figures ----------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , told us that [PER Luzhkov  ] 's wife , [PER Yelena Baturina  ] , definitely has links to the criminal world , and particularly to the [LOC Solntsevo  ] criminal group ( widely regarded by [MISC Russian  ] law enforcement as one of the most powerful organized crime groups in [LOC Russia  ] ) . 
According to the [MISC Internet  ] article , " On the [ORG Moscow Group  ] , " [PER Vladimir Yevtushenko  ] , the head of the company [ORG Sistema  ] , is married to [PER Natalya Yevtushenko  ] , [PER Baturina  ] 's sister . 
[ORG Sistema  ] was created with [LOC Moscow  ] city government-owned shares , and [ORG Sistema  ] initially focused on privatizing the capital 's real estate and gas . 
[ORG Sistema  ] 's president , [PER Yevgeny Novitsky  ] , controlled the [LOC Solntsevo  ] criminal gang . 
Today , [ORG Sistema  ] has spun off into various companies , which implement projects that typically include 50 percent funding from the [LOC Moscow  ] city government. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [PER Luzhkov  ] used criminal money to support his rise to power and has been involved with bribes and deals regarding lucrative construction contracts throughout [LOC Moscow  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that [PER Luzhkov  ] 's friends and associates ( including recently deceased crime boss [PER Vyacheslav Ivankov  ] and reputedly corrupt Duma Deputy [PER Joseph Kobzon  ] ) are " bandits . 
" He told us that he knew this because he formerly had contacts in these criminal groups , but many of his contacts have since been killed . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that the [LOC Moscow  ] government has links to many different criminal groups and it regularly takes cash bribes from businesses . 
The people under [PER Luzhkov  ] maintain these criminal connections . 
Recently , ultranationalist LDPR opposition party leader [PER Vladimir Zhirinovskiy  ] strongly criticized [PER Luzhkov  ] and called for him to step down , claiming that [PER Luzhkov  ] 's government was the " most criminal " in [MISC Russian  ] history . 
This remarkable denunciation , carried on state TV flagship [LOC Channel One  ] , was widely seen as an indirect [LOC Kremlin  ] rebuke of [LOC Luzhkov.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us everyone knows that [LOC Russia  ] 's laws do not work . 
The [LOC Moscow  ] system is based on officials making money . 
The government bureaucrats , [ORG FSB  ] , [ORG MVD  ] , police , and prosecutor 's offices all accept bribes . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated that everything depends on the [LOC Kremlin  ] and he thought that [PER Luzhkov  ] , as well as many mayors and governors , pay off key insiders in the [LOC Kremlin  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] argued that the vertical works because people are paying bribes all the way to the top . 
He told us that people often witness officials going into the [LOC Kremlin  ] with large suitcases and bodyguards , and he speculated that the suitcases are full of money . 
The governors collect money based on bribes , almost resembling a tax system , throughout their regions . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] described how there are parallel structures in the regions in which people are able to pay their leaders . 
For instance , the [ORG FSB  ] , [ORG MVD  ] , and militia all have distinct money collection systems . 
Further , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that deputies generally have to buy their seats in the government . 
They need money to get to the top , but once they are there , their positions become quite lucrative money making opportunities . 
Bureaucrats in [LOC Moscow  ] are notorious for doing all kinds of illegal business to get extra money. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [PER Luzhkov  ] is following orders from the [LOC Kremlin  ] to not go after [LOC Moscow  ] 's criminal groups . 
For example , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] argued that it was only a public relations stunt from [PER Putin  ] to close gambling . 
In contrast to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he did not see the sense in suitcases of money going into the [LOC Kremlin  ] since it would be easier to open a secret account in [LOC Cyprus  ] . 
He speculated that the [LOC Moscow  ] police heads have a secret war chest of money . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that this money is likely used to solve problems that the [LOC Kremlin  ] decides , such as rigging elections . 
It can be accessed as a resource for when orders come from above , for example , for bribes or to pay off people when necessary . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] postulated that the [LOC Kremlin  ] might say to a governor that he can rule a certain territory but in exchange he must do what the [LOC Kremlin  ] says. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Notwithstanding [PER Luzhkov  ] 's solid position , some of our contacts believe that cracks have appeared in his armor , due [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00000317 003 OF 003 to his corrupt activities . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that [PER Luzhkov  ] has many enemies because his wife has the most lucrative business deals in [LOC Moscow  ] and many people think [PER Luzhkov  ] has received too much money . 
The son of the head of the interior police , [PER Vladimir Kolokotsev  ] , told [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that [PER Kolokotsev  ] 's number one job is to get [PER Luzhkov  ] out within a year . 
[PER Kolokotsev  ] was credited with removing long-standing Governor [PER Yegor Stroyev  ] from [LOC Orel  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] asserted that [PER Luzhkov  ] is " on his way out , " although he acknowledged that the [LOC Kremlin  ] has not identified a suitable replacement yet . 
Issues such as corruption and traffic congestion have , to a certain degree , eroded [PER Luzhkov  ] 's popularity . 
[PER Putin  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , will likely pick the quietest and least expected person to replace [PER Luzhkov  ] . 
In [LOC Moscow  ] , Everyone Needs a " [MISC Krysha  ] " ------------------------------------ <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) According to many observers , the lawless criminal climate in [LOC Russia  ] makes it difficult for businesses to survive without being defended by some type of protection . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] explained how bribes work in [MISC Moscow:  ] a cafe owner pays the local police chief via cash through a courier . 
He needs to pay a certain negotiated amount over a certain profit . 
The high prices of goods in [LOC Moscow  ] cover these hidden costs . 
Sometimes people receive " bad protection " in the sense that the " krysha " extorts an excessive amount of money . 
As a result , they cannot make enough of a profit to maintain their businesses . 
If people attempt to forego protection , they will instantly be shut down . 
For example , officials from the fire or sanitation service will appear at the business and invent a violation . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , everyone has bought into the idea of protection in [LOC Moscow  ] , so it has become a norm . 
In general , [PER Muscovites  ] have little freedom to speak out against corrupt activities and are afraid of their leaders. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] explained that [LOC Moscow  ] business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the [ORG MVD  ] and [ORG FSB  ] ( rather than organized crime groups ) since they not only have more guns , resources , and power than criminal groups , but they are also protected by the law . 
For this reason , protection from criminal gangs is no longer so high in demand . 
Police and [ORG MVD  ] collect money from small businesses while the [ORG FSB  ] collects from big businesses . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , the [ORG FSB  ] " krysha " is allegedly the best protection . 
He told us that , while the [ORG MVD  ] and [ORG FSB  ] both have close links to [LOC Solntsevo  ] , the [ORG FSB  ] is the real " krysha " for [LOC Solntsevo  ] . 
This system is not an incentive for smaller businesses and nobody is immune ; even rich people who think they are protected get arrested . 
According to [ORG Transparency International  ] 's 2009 survey , bribery costs [LOC Russia  ] USD 300 billion a year , or about 18 percent of its gross domestic product . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] argued that the " krysha " system has led to an erosion of police internal discipline . 
For instance , young police officers spend their money buying luxury vehicles that a normal worker could never afford . 
Comment ------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Despite [PER Medvedev  ] 's stated anti-corruption campaign , the extent of corruption in [LOC Moscow  ] remains pervasive with Mayor [PER Luzhkov  ] at the top of the pyramid . 
[PER Luzhkov  ] oversees a system in which it appears that almost everyone at every level is involved in some form of corruption or criminal behavior . 
[PER Putin  ] and [PER Medvedev  ] 's dilemma is deciding when [PER Luzhkov  ] becomes a bigger liability than asset . 
While public sentiment against [PER Luzhkov  ] has grown since the " tainted " elections in October 2009 , United [LOC Russia  ] 's leadership knows that he has been a loyal supporter who can deliver voter support . 
Ousting [PER Luzhkov  ] before he is ready to go could create major difficulties because he could link others in the government to the corruption . 
While reforming [PER Luzhkov  ] 's questionable activities might seem like the right thing to do , for now keeping him in place , efficiently running the city , is United [LOC Russia  ] 's best option . 
Ultimately , the tandem will put [PER Luzhkov  ] out to pasture , like it has done with fellow long-term regional leaders like [LOC Sverdlovsk  ] oblast governor [PER Edward Rossel  ] and [ORG Tatarstan President  ] [PER Mintimir Shaymiyev  ] .
