[LOC PARIS  ] POINTS JULY 15 B. [LOC PARIS  ] POINTS JULY 6 C. [LOC PARIS  ] POINTS APRIL 10 D. [LOC PARIS  ] 1025 Classified By: Political Minister-Counselor [PER Kathy Allegrone  ] for Reasons 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) SUMMARY: [MISC French  ] officials have made clear that nuclear issues enjoy the sustained attention of President [PER Sarkozy  ] and have become a major foreign policy priority , especially in the run-up to the spring 2010 [ORG Review Conference  ] ( [ORG RevCon  ] ) of the [MISC Non-Proliferation Treaty  ] ( [MISC NPT  ] ) . 
[MISC France’s  ] concerns go beyond the conference , however , to include larger issues of the link between disarmament and deterrence , as well as non-proliferation . 
In various meetings , [MISC French  ] officials have noted repeatedly what they see as worrying trends in both [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC UK  ] disarmament policy pronouncements . 
Based on the calculation that they cannot fight a winning battle against or without us , and alongside a public strategy of positioning themselves as leaders on disarmament , the [MISC French  ] are at great pains to coordinate with the [LOC United States  ] to assuage their own concerns and present a united front to others on these issues . 
The seriousness with which the [ORG GOF  ] takes these issues means that [LOC France  ] can be a valuable partner to the [LOC United States  ] on nuclear issues if we can calm their fears over our position on disarmament while making clear our policy goals and redlines . 
END SUMMARY. --------------------------------------------- - PUBLICLY PROCLAIMING LEADERSHIP ON DISARMAMENT --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [LOC France  ] kicked off its reaction to President [PER Obama’s  ] nuclear policies immediately following his April 5 remarks in [LOC Prague  ] with a public campaign to highlight [MISC France’s  ] efforts toward disarmament , comparing their achievements favorably to the objectives outlined by the [LOC U.S.  ] President . 
On April 9 , centrist daily [ORG Le Figaro  ] - which tends to reflect official positions - published an anonymous report from the [LOC Elysee  ] saying President [PER Obama’s  ] statement largely recalled positions long-held by [LOC France  ] ( ref C ) . 
To further highlight [MISC French  ] leadership , the same paper reported just prior to President [PER Obama’s  ] visit to [LOC Moscow  ] that [LOC France  ] had opened up the dismantled [MISC Pierrelatte  ] fissile material production site to a group of journalists ( ref B ) as proof of [MISC France’s  ] commitment to stopping the production of fissile materials ahead of [MISC FMCT  ] negotiations. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) The [MISC French  ] MFA also produced statements on July 7 and 10 - immediately following President [PER Obama’s  ] [LOC Moscow  ] trip - trumpeting [MISC France’s  ] steps towards disarmament and claiming a unique leadership role among nuclear powers . 
The statements cited [MISC France’s  ] reduction of its nuclear warheads to 300 , dismantling of fissile material production sites , and a moratorium on fissile material production , while welcoming [MISC U.S.-Russian  ] negotiations to reduce nuclear arsenals “which represent 95% of the global stockpiles.” ------------------------------ EAGER FOR ENERGETIC ENGAGEMENT ------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) This flurry of publicity was followed up in July by a series of high-level , interagency engagements by the [ORG GOF  ] on nuclear issues with the [ORG Embassy  ] and with key officials from [LOC Washington  ] . 
Political Director [PER Gerard Araud  ] has vowed that [LOC France  ] is ready to coordinate with the [LOC United States  ] on these issues “every day if necessary” ( [PER Note: Araud  ] is headed to [LOC New York  ] in late August to take up his new position as PermRep . 
End Note . 
) . 
[PER Jacques Audibert  ] , currently A/S-equivalent for [ORG Strategic Affairs  ] and Araud’s replacement as Political Director , has told us he expects to spend “most of his time” in 2009 on non-proliferation and disarmament issues . 
He called for continued engagement and early coordination , hoping to meet again on the sidelines of an expected P5 confidence-building meeting in [LOC London  ] in September . 
[ORG Elysee Military Advisor Edouard Guillaud  ] added [LOC France  ] was eager to support [LOC U.S.  ] ratification of the [MISC Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty  ] , for example by sending [MISC French  ] experts to the [LOC U.S.  ] and by providing briefings to Codels in [LOC Paris.  ] -------------- [MISC FRENCH  ] WORRIES -------------- [LOC PARIS  ] 00001039 002 OF 004 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In large part , [MISC France’s  ] desire to work ever more closely with the [LOC United States  ] on nuclear issues reflects new concerns with [LOC U.S.  ] policy , based on analysis of recent statements by President [PER Obama  ] , specifically his comments that: “The notion that prestige comes from holding these weapons , or that we can protect ourselves by picking and choosing which nations can have these weapons , is an illusion , ” ( [LOC Moscow  ] ) and “No single nation should pick and chose which nations hold nuclear weapons . 
That is why I strongly reaffirmed [MISC America’s  ] commitment to seek a world in which no nations hold nuclear weapons” ( [LOC Cairo  ] ) . 
The [MISC French  ] read this as counter to the spirit of the [MISC NPT  ] , in which this discrimination is inherent . 
Although [LOC U.S.  ] interlocutors have pointed out that these speeches were intended to strengthen [MISC NPT  ] principles , [PER Araud  ] and [ORG Ministry of Defense U/S-equivalent for Strategic Affairs  ] [PER Michel Miraillet  ] said they fear non-aligned nations and [MISC NPT  ] violators can easily interpret these remarks to their advantage . 
[ORG Miraillet  ] even asked for advance warning of any speeches about nuclear issues that might contain “surprises.” Several of our [MISC French  ] interlocutors have expressed concerns that these statements focus more on disarmament than on non-proliferation . 
[PER Araud  ] , [PER Audibert  ] , and MFA DAS-equivalent for Disarmament and Nonproliferation [PER Martin Briens  ] said that in touting [MISC U.S.-Russian  ] negotiations and elaborating a long-term vision of total disarmament in the President’s speeches , the [LOC U.S.  ] will make it easier for non-aligned nations to focus at the 2010 [ORG RevCon  ] on actual progress on disarmament and avoid discussions of non-proliferation. ---- [LOC IRAN  ] ---- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [ORG GOF  ] has expressed its dismay at the [LOC U.S.  ] decision to not mention [LOC Iran  ] by name and make reference to its need to adhere to the Additional Protocol at the PrepCon . 
The [MISC French  ] have indicated that the NPT’s most urgent mission is to curb the [MISC Iranian  ] potential to develop nuclear weapons . 
In order to address [LOC Iran  ] head-on , [PER Briens  ] has emphasized that partners will have to abandon fears that they might disturb an atmosphere conducive to larger engagement of [LOC Iran  ] . 
[LOC France  ] has also welcomed [LOC U.S.  ] assurances that we do not support nuclear capabilities for [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] or [LOC Egypt  ] , which they said would be tantamount to accepting a nuclear armed [LOC Iran  ] . 
The [MISC French  ] focus on [LOC Iran  ] at the [MISC NPT  ] comes in the context of a general [MISC French  ] preference for strong rhetoric and strong action on [LOC Iran  ] , based on the apparently broad [ORG GOF  ] consensus that a nuclear [LOC Iran  ] presents an unacceptable danger to [MISC French  ] interests . 
While numerous [MISC French  ] officials have highlighted their efforts to encourage strengthening sanctions against [LOC Iran  ] with [ORG EU  ] and [ORG UN  ] partners , they have little optimism that these efforts will bear fruit . 
They are now concentrating on close cooperation with the [LOC United States  ] and individual bilateral measures by individual partners to help increase pressure on the [MISC Iranian  ] regime. ---- [MISC FMCT  ] ---- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [LOC France  ] is currently reviewing its policy on an [MISC FMCT  ] , a process the [ORG GOF  ] expects to complete by the end of September . 
[LOC France  ] has stopped its own production of fissile materials , and is in favor of a multilateral [MISC FMCT  ] , which they view as a key measure to cap stockpiles in [LOC China  ] , [LOC India  ] , [LOC Israel  ] , and [LOC Brazil  ] by addressing the issue of future production in a legal regime . 
However , [PER Briens  ] has made clear that any effort to address the issue of existing stocks within the agreement is a [MISC French  ] redline . 
Noting [MISC France’s  ] transparency in admitting its total number of weapons , [PER Briens  ] said limiting its small stocks of fissile materials would undercut the credibility of [MISC France’s  ] long-term deterrent . 
While [LOC France  ] is willing to discuss transparency on stockpiles within the P5 , [MISC French  ] officials have repeatedly said they will not accept tabling this issue in [LOC Geneva  ] . 
As [LOC France  ] proceeds with its policy review , [MISC French  ] officials have expressed interest in [LOC U.S.  ] views on verification and sanctions for non-compliance. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In the context of an [MISC FMCT  ] , [MISC French  ] officials have repeatedly mentioned China’s expected opposition to real progress , regretting that , unlike [LOC France  ] or the [LOC United States  ] , the [MISC Chinese  ] are not publicly challenged on their lack of action . 
As part of an effort to encourage movement by the [MISC Chinese  ] , the MFA Disarmament and Non-proliferation section’s [PER Celine Jurgensen  ] told us that [LOC France  ] intends to call for a [LOC PARIS  ] 00001039 003 OF 004 universal moratorium on fissile material production as [MISC FMCT  ] negotiations proceed ( ref D ) . 
Noting potential progress in [LOC Geneva  ] on starting these negotiations , [PER Jurgensen  ] said [LOC France  ] intends to move as soon as possible , potentially making its plea for a moratorium at [ORG UN First Committee  ] discussions this autumn. ------------------------------------------ AN OPPORTUNITY TO INFLUENCE [LOC U.S.  ] RHETORIC ? ------------------------------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) As the [MISC GOF’s  ] focus on President Obama’s speeches shows , [MISC French  ] concerns currently focus on [LOC U.S.  ] rhetoric and they hope to shape our views in their favor during the current [LOC U.S.  ] policy reviews underway . 
As [PER Briens  ] told us , [LOC France  ] is worried that non-aligned countries will try and use the [ORG RevCon  ] as a referendum on P5 progress on disarmament to forestall calls to fulfill non-proliferation obligations or take on new ones , such as the Additional Protocol . 
Even if the [LOC U.S.  ] is fully committed to disarmament , the results will be long term , allowing non-aligned countries to cite a lack of progress by the time of the [ORG RevCon  ] as a sign of P5 hypocrisy. --------------------------------------------- ---------- [MISC FRANCE’S  ] UNTOUCHABLE REDLINE: DELEGITIMIZING DETERRENCE --------------------------------------------- ---------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) However , [MISC France’s  ] concerns about [LOC U.S.  ] rhetoric go beyond [ORG RevCon  ] tactics and to the heart of [MISC French  ] nuclear theology . 
[PER Araud  ] said that any statements that are seen to delegitimize the idea of a nuclear deterrent capacity directly threaten [MISC French  ] strategic interests , which are fundamentally and “psychologically” bound to [MISC France’s  ] deterrent . 
[MISC France’s  ] policy of nuclear deterrence is supported by parties across the political spectrum and has become an essential part of [MISC French  ] strategic identity . 
In the negotiations preceding [MISC France’s  ] return to [MISC NATO’s  ] integrated military command , President [PER Sarkozy  ] made clear that an independent [MISC French  ] nuclear policy was an “untouchable” redline . 
And in a notable departure from the official refrain that [LOC France  ] looks forward to cooperating with the [LOC United States  ] , [PER Araud  ] explicitly threatened that [LOC France  ] would “stonewall” if it felt its sensitivities were being ignored . 
In this context , [MISC French  ] officials are especially keen for details on how the [LOC United States  ] plans to “hedge” by maintaining a deterrent in addition to our disarmament efforts and how [LOC U.S.  ] disarmament goals can accommodate build ups by [LOC China  ] and possibly [LOC Iran.  ] --------------------------- [LOC FRANCE  ] WORRIED ABOUT THE [LOC UK  ] --------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC France’s  ] concerns over evolving [LOC U.S.  ] nuclear policy come in the context of similar , but even greater , concerns with the [LOC UK  ] . 
[PER Audibert  ] told us July 10 that the July 6 [MISC France-UK  ] defense summit was difficult across a range of issues , but specifically cited [MISC British  ] support for eliminating nuclear arsenals ( ref A ) as a major area of divergence . 
[PER Araud  ] and the [PER Elysee’s Guillaud  ] fear [MISC British  ] nuclear policy is being guided for the moment by [ORG Labour Party  ] “demagogues” for domestic political consumption . 
[PER Briens  ] added that [PER Gordon Brown  ] seems to have decided disarmament will be his legacy , and the [LOC UK  ] has moved from talking about disarmament as a political sop to gain parliamentary support for renewing its [MISC Trident  ] force , to embracing disarmament as an end in itself . 
According to [PER Briens  ] , in some fora , the [LOC UK  ] has shown willingness to accept clauses calling for a “ban on nuclear weapons.” Critically , [LOC UK  ] rhetoric suggests that nuclear weapons are inherently bad , thus implying that maintaining a deterrent force is immoral . 
For [LOC France  ] “nuclear weapons are not bad or good , they just are.” Thus , [LOC France  ] continues to oppose the phrase “a world free of nuclear weapons , ” which in Araud’s view implies a moral judgment . 
However , [LOC France  ] can accept “a world without nuclear weapons , ” which the [ORG GOF  ] thinks is more neutral. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG UK Political Officer  ] [PER Ben Fender  ] told us on July 21 that the [MISC French  ] have been very vocal in their concern about [LOC UK  ] disarmament policy , particularly following a March 17 speech by PM [PER Gordon Brown  ] suggesting the [LOC UK  ] was ready for further reductions to its nuclear arsenal . 
While admitting that [PER Brown  ] cut his political teeth in a 1980s [ORG Labour Party  ] supportive of unilateral disarmament , [PER Fender  ] has been at pains to convince the [ORG GOF  ] that in the context of the [ORG RevCon  ] , [LOC PARIS  ] 00001039 004 OF 004 the [LOC UK  ] and [LOC France  ] actually have very little to argue about . 
[LOC Britain  ] also wants a balanced focus on all three pillars , and agrees on the need to work with the [LOC P3  ] to reach out to non-aligned countries and discourage spoilers . 
According to [PER Fender  ] , the short term France/UK disagreement is essentially one of rhetoric: [LOC France  ] feels talk of disarmament ultimately weakens the [LOC P3  ] diplomatically , while the [LOC UK  ] feels that a publicly pro-disarmament stance gives the [LOC P3  ] diplomatic leverage to shift the discussion to non-proliferation by arguing that the nuclear states are doing their part. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Fender  ] added that , in the UK’s view , while any moves seen to threaten the legitimacy of [MISC France’s  ] deterrent will remain a redline , there are other issues that “France will make noise on , but ultimately come along.” In the latter category , [PER Fender  ] mentioned specifically transparency measures in an [MISC FMCT  ] . 
The danger , in his view , is that [LOC France  ] will feel that its deterrence redline is not being respected by allies and retreat to its box , blocking progress on other issues . 
Serious engagement by both the [LOC United States  ] and the [LOC UK  ] will be necessary to reassure the [MISC French  ] and prevent this scenario. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG COMMENT:  ] The [ORG GOF  ] is anxious for [LOC P3  ] unity and close cooperation with the [LOC United States  ] in rolling out disarmament and non-proliferation goals in the coming year . 
Therefore , [LOC France  ] is nervous that the [LOC U.S.  ] position on disarmament is moving further away from their own and that we are more accommodating to the concerns of non-aligned nations over existing stockpiles . 
The [MISC GOF’s  ] proactive engagement of [LOC U.S.  ] officials suggests a strategy of attempting to influence [LOC U.S.  ] policy as it is being elaborated in order to protect , in their view , the diplomatic viability of their own deterrent capacity . 
The potential pitfalls with these concerns will be if the [ORG GOF  ] continues to feel the [LOC United States  ] is “delegitimizing” their nuclear deterrent , thus precipitating classic [MISC French  ] obstructionism ( as threatened by [PER Araud  ] and feared by the [MISC British  ] ) that could turn a valuable partner on non-proliferation into an institutional “non.” Continued communication between [LOC Washington  ] officials and their [MISC French  ] counterparts will help tamp down misunderstandings of our position before they escalate , while displaying at the same time a commitment to cooperating with the [ORG GOF  ] on this policy priority . 
In this context , the recent visits by Ambassador [PER Susan Burk  ] , [ORG Special Advisor Robert Einhorn  ] , and Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Dr. [PER James Miller  ] were greatly appreciated by our [MISC French  ] interlocutors . 
As next steps , post suggests the following for the [MISC Department’s  ] consideration: - Maintaining regular senior-level engagement with the [ORG GOF  ] on nuclear issues in [LOC Paris  ] , [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC Geneva  ] , [LOC New York  ] , and elsewhere , ensuring direct and clear lines of communication and clarifying our position and our redlines ; - Reiterating to the [MISC French  ] that our positions regarding the [ORG RevCon  ] are largely in synch ; - Continuing active discussions at both technical and political levels of those topics where disagreements may remain but where we might find common ground , such as the nature of an FMCT or how to deal with [LOC Iran  ] at the [ORG RevCon  ] ; - Using this engagement as an opportunity to look for early warning signs that [MISC French  ] suspicions regarding our position on disarmament may be leading to obstructionist behavior that could halt progress on areas where agreement would otherwise be possible .
