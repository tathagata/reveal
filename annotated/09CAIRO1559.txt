( C ) On August 2 , PM PDAS [PER Tom Countryman  ] led an interagency visit to [LOC Cairo  ] to discuss recent potential violations of the Government of [LOC Egypt  ] , s ( [ORG GOE  ] ) end-use , retransfer , and security obligations involving [MISC U.S.-provided  ] defense articles and defense services ( ref A ) involving U.S.- origin equipment and technology with the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] . 
The delegation included representatives from [LOC PM/RSAT  ] , [LOC NEA/ELA  ] , the Office of the Secretary of [LOC Defense  ] , Joint Staff and [ORG U.S. Central Command  ] . 
Major General [PER Mohammed al-Assar  ] , Assistant Minister of [LOC Defense  ] for [LOC Policy  ] , led the [MISC Egyptian  ] side , accompanied by Major General [PER Fouad Abdel Halim  ] , Assistant Minister of [LOC Defense  ] for [ORG Armament  ] and Major General [PER Ahmed al-Moataz  ] , Chief of the [ORG U.S. Relations branch.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Al-Assar  ] said he had " high hopes " for establishing a " new dialogue " with the [LOC U.S.  ] following President [PER Obama  ] 's June speech in [LOC Cairo  ] . 
[LOC Egypt  ] 's relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] is " tremendously important , " he continued , viewing the military-military relationship as the " backbone " of bilateral cooperation . 
PDAS [PER Countryman  ] expressed appreciation for the strategic relationship with [LOC Egypt  ] and strong security cooperation over the last 30 years. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) PDAS [PER Countryman  ] noted that overall , [LOC Egypt  ] has a good record of protecting its large inventory of [LOC U.S.  ] equipment and technology . 
Many countries , however , expend great energy to illegally obtain [LOC U.S.  ] technology . 
In order to provide our partners with the best military equipment available , strict protections must exist to prevent compromise , he added . 
PDAS [PER Countryman  ] stressed the important role [ORG Congress  ] plays in monitoring end-use compliance . 
He explained that the Department , through the PM [MISC Bureau  ] , was required to notify [ORG Congress  ] of any potential end-use violations. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) PDAS [PER Countryman  ] emphasized the importance of a clear and transparent picture of [LOC Egypt  ] 's end-use performance , including the measures being taken to prevent further violations . 
He noted that [LOC Egypt  ] had more potential [ORG Section  ] 3 violations than any other country in the world over the last several years . 
Cases involving the [MISC Chinese  ] , he continued , were of particular concern ( ref A ) . 
If [LOC Egypt  ] cannot demonstrate that it is taking the necessary steps to prevent future violations , the necessary [ORG Congressional  ] consent for important Foreign [ORG Military Financing  ] ( [ORG FMF  ] ) -funded programs could be delayed , such as M1A1 co-production and the proposed purchase of [MISC F-16  ] aircraft. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) SDO/DATT Major General [PER Williams  ] offered his assessment of the recent potential violations , saying that the cases demonstrated a lack of awareness amongst [ORG MOD  ] officials on end-use rules . 
He explained that the Office of [ORG Military Cooperation  ] ( [ORG OMC  ] ) had already begun a training program for mid-level [MISC Egyptian  ] officials to address the lack of awareness , noting that [ORG OMC  ] had received full cooperation from [ORG MOD  ] on delivering the course ( ref B ) . 
General [PER Williams  ] added that the [ORG MOD  ] had agreed to include end-use issues in the agenda for the annual [ORG Military Cooperation Committee  ] meeting . 
He also highlighted the increase in third-party transfer requests from the [ORG MOD  ] , indicating that the training program had increased awareness of end-use regulations. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Major General [PER Abdel Halim  ] , who is responsible for the [ORG FMF  ] program , stressed that [LOC Egypt  ] follows all regulations , including the end-use , retransfer and security obligations included with every purchase of [LOC U.S.  ] equipment made by the [ORG GOE  ] . 
He noted that until the last four years , [LOC Egypt  ] had no [ORG Section  ] 3 violations , adding that the recent violations were a " minor thing " that could be overcome . 
On the recent violations , he said that [ORG MOD  ] had been very transparent with the Embassy on discussing each individual case . 
[PER Al-Assar  ] stressed that [LOC Egypt  ] takes its end-use obligations " very seriously " and was taking " all measures " to prevent further incidents . 
He said that recent violations involved " junior officers making mistakes " without any high-level involvement . 
In the case of the reverse engineering of a 155 mm gun tube ( ref C ) , the [ORG MOD  ] quickly fired the engineer involved and said the engineer " did not know it was a violation . 
" ----------- Way Forward ----------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) PDAS [PER Countryman  ] acknowledged [LOC Egypt  ] , s good faith efforts to report and redress apparent violations . 
He outlined several steps [LOC Egypt  ] could take to demonstrate its commitment to preventing further end-use violations . 
[PER Al-Assar  ] replied that the [ORG MOD  ] cooperated fully with [ORG OMC  ] and was already taking the appropriate measures to prevent a reoccurrence , including naming a point of contact responsible for end-use issues . 
[PER Al-Assar  ] said that the [ORG MOD  ] considered raising end-use awareness amongst its officials to be an important goal , but stressed that training had to be conducted " carefully " in order to prevent the appearance of " [LOC U.S.  ] interference . 
" Major General [PER Abdel Halim  ] suggested that the [ORG MOD  ] could provide periodic training ( every two months ) to the " consigned officers " responsible for protecting [LOC U.S.  ] equipment and technology under the auspices of the [ORG Armament Authority  ] . 
This training would then filter down to the operators of [LOC U.S.  ] equipment at the unit level . 
Having [ORG MOD  ] officials quietly deliver the training , instead of [MISC Americans  ] , would allow [ORG MOD  ] to frame the training as " self-protection " of [MISC Egyptian  ] equipment and not as a new restriction from the [LOC U.S.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) PDAS [PER Countryman  ] commented on the recent violations , saying that in the case of the 155 gun tube , [ORG MOD  ] did the right thing by taking swift action against the engineer responsible , adding that the case did not raise much concern . 
The case involving the visit of a [MISC Chinese  ] military official to an [MISC F-16  ] base ( ref D ) , however , did raise genuine concerns about the transfer of [LOC US  ] technology . 
He noted that [LOC U.S.  ] concerns over the visit had already delayed [LOC Egypt  ] 's request to purchase [MISC F-16  ] aircraft . 
PDAS [PER Countryman  ] stressed the importance of receiving a consistent story of what happened during the [MISC Chinese  ] official 's visit ( Note: We have received conflicting reports from [ORG MOD  ] officials on what the [MISC Chinese  ] official saw during his tour . 
End Note ) . 
PDAS [PER Countryman  ] suggested that the [ORG MOD  ] should conduct an internal analysis of the eight potential [ORG Section  ] 3 violations over the last four years to identify the reason behind each violation , which would help guide any solution . 
An analytical review would also help determine if training is reaching the right audience. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Al-Assar  ] did not respond directly , but said [ORG MOD  ] was open to any program that would increase awareness of its end-use , retransfer and security obligations . 
PDAS [PER Countryman  ] urged the [ORG MOD  ] to take proactive , concrete steps to demonstrate its determination to prevent future violations . 
He suggested [ORG MOD  ] agree in writing to the following actions: 1 ) Conduct an internal analysis of the eight potential violations to be shared with the [ORG OMC  ] , 2 ) Commit to an end-use training plan , and 3 ) Identify one senior official as a point of contact for end-use issues . 
PDAS [PER Countryman  ] understood [ORG MOD  ] 's reluctance to sign a document during the meeting , but promised to provide a text for the [ORG MOD  ] 's review . 
[PER Al-Assar  ] agreed to review the text for accuracy , but did not commit to signing any document. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Subsequent to the meeting , al-Assar reviewed the proposed text , but declined to sign the document . 
He verbally concurred that the [ORG MOD  ] would continue [MISC OMC-provided  ] end-use training , create a new [MISC MOD-administered  ] periodic training course , name a high-level official ( MG [PER Abdul Halim  ] ) to be a point of contact on end-use issues , and add end-use issues to the agenda for the annual [ORG Military Cooperation Committee  ] meetings . 
He declined to conduct an internal analysis on the end-use violations. ------------------- [ORG Mil-Mil Cooperation  ] ------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) At the conclusion of the end-use monitoring portion of the meeting , al-Assar raised several issues related to bilateral military cooperation . 
He urged the [LOC U.S.  ] not to allow a third-party ( [LOC Israel  ] ) to delay the political release of advanced weapons systems to [LOC Egypt  ] . 
[PER Al-Assar  ] had " high hopes " that the new [ORG U.S. Administration  ] would be more supportive of releasing weapons systems to [LOC Egypt  ] . 
( Note: [LOC Egypt  ] has long requested the release of certain weapons systems , like the TOW 2B , LONGBOW , and [ORG JAVELIN  ] . 
[LOC Egypt  ] is prevented from acquiring some systems because of Minister of [LOC Defense Tantawi  ] 's refusal to sign the necessary security agreement ( [ORG CISMOA  ] ) . 
The [ORG GoE  ] also believes that concerns over [LOC Israel  ] 's [ORG Qualitative Military Edge  ] have prevented weapons systems from being released to [LOC Egypt  ] . 
End Note ) . <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Al-Assar  ] also emphasized the importance of maintaining the 2:3 ratio for [ORG FMF  ] provided to [LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC Israel  ] established after the Camp [PER David Peace  ] accord , in order to sustain the " regional balance . 
" He noted that over the last 10 years , [LOC Israel  ] 's [ORG FMF  ] level has grown substantially , while [LOC Egypt  ] 's annual [ORG FMF  ] level has remained at $1.3 billion . 
The modernization of the [MISC Egyptian  ] military was critical to [LOC Egypt  ] 's ability to defend its territory , he continued , stressing that " we want to proceed with our modernization plan with the [LOC United States  ] . 
" Any delay in the political release of weapons systems and [ORG Congressional  ] conditioning of bilateral assistance was " not good " for the modernization plan. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) PDAS [PER Countryman  ] repeated that the [LOC U.S.  ] appreciates the strategic importance of [LOC Egypt  ] . 
While [LOC US  ] political constraints on weapons sales are a real factor , they had not , he believed , prevented [LOC Egypt  ] from building a military adequate to its regional responsibilities . 
He noted that [LOC Egypt  ] could best help itself with the [ORG Administration  ] and with [ORG Congress  ] by insuring the proper protection of [LOC U.S.  ] technology and equipment , and by continuing its efforts to interdict [MISC Iranian  ] shipment of weapons bound for [ORG Hamas  ] and [ORG Hizballah.  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( U ) PDAS [PER Countryman  ] cleared this cable .
