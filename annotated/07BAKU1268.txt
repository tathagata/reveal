( C ) [MISC SUMMARY:  ] During a October 19 steering committee meeting of the [ORG Azerbaijan International Oil Consortium  ] ( [ORG AIOC  ] ) , the [ORG State Oil Company of Azerbaijan  ] ( [ORG SOCAR  ] ) , representing the [LOC Azerbaijan  ] government , avoided declaring the [ORG Consortium  ] in material breach of the [MISC Production Sharing Agreement  ] ( [ORG PSA  ] ) as it had been threatening to do , an act which would have worsened the current dispute between the two parties over short-term issues potentially involving billions of dollars . 
[ORG SOCAR  ] did give the [ORG Consortium  ] an unrealistic ultimatum to “solve all outstanding issues within a week , ” but [ORG Consortium  ] partners plan to counter-propose a working group to work on settling the issues of contention . 
Embassy will continue to monitor events and press for a negotiating environment in which a mutually satisfactory conclusion can be reached . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) BACKGROUND: According to [ORG BP Azerbaijan  ] , the commercial dispute between the [ORG AIOC Consortium  ] ( formed as a result of the 1994 [LOC Azerbaijan  ] Chirag [PER Guneshli  ] ( ACG ) [MISC Production Sharing Agreement  ] , and consisting of [ORG BP  ] , [ORG Chevron  ] , [ORG Inpex  ] , [ORG SOCAR  ] , [ORG Statoil  ] , [ORG ExxonMobil  ] , [ORG TPAO  ] , [ORG Devon  ] , [ORG Itochu  ] and [ORG Hess  ] ) and the Government of [LOC Azerbaijan  ] , as represented by [ORG SOCAR  ] , centers on three main issues , the first two of which influence the percentages of ‘profit oil’ going to each party: - Calculation of the “Total [PER Transportation Cost”  ] ( [ORG TTC  ] ) - Calculation of the “Rate of [MISC Return”  ] ( [ORG ROR  ] ) - [ORG SOCAR  ] claim of collusion between the [ORG BTC  ] and [ORG AIOC  ] Consortiums so that the [ORG BTC  ] project was deliberately slowed down in order to influence [ORG TTC  ] by driving up transportation costs. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Part of the dispute stems from the [ORG ACG/AIOC PSA  ] not defining some key terms , so that , for example , while the [ORG Consortium  ] claims that finance costs should be considered as a type of petroleum cost and hence taken into account when calculating [ORG ROR  ] , [ORG SOCAR  ] disagrees . 
[ORG BP  ] says SOCAR’s claims stem from the fact that “it doesn’t like the [ORG PSA  ] it signed 14 years ago , ” and that [ORG AIOC  ] has done due diligence on its accounting practices to confirm that the Consortium’s methodologies adhere to the [ORG PSA  ] . 
[ORG SOCAR  ] claims , inter alia , that the [ORG Consortium  ] itself , by changing the methods used for calculating the [ORG ROR  ] , is acting outside the [ORG PSA  ] , in a “dishonest” attempt to maximize revenue . 
BP: [ORG SOCAR  ] THREATENING TO “GO KAZAKH” ------------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) On October 17 , [ORG BP Azerbaijan  ] VP-Commercial Dr. [PER Phil Home  ] commented that on October 2 [ORG SOCAR  ] President [PER Rovnaq Abdullayev  ] had summoned [ORG BP Azerbaijan  ] President [PER Bill Schrader  ] , to inform him that [ORG SOCAR  ] intended to claim that the [ORG AIOC Consortium  ] was in material breach of the [ORG PSA.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Home  ] said that [ORG SOCAR  ] had called for a convening of the [ORG AIOC Steering Committee  ] on October 19 , at which time [ORG SOCAR  ] might formally claim material breach . 
[PER Home  ] said that according to the [ORG PSA  ] , once [ORG SOCAR  ] ( on behalf of [LOC Azerbaijan  ] ) claims material breach , then the [ORG AIOC Consortium  ] has 90 days to “respond or rectify.” If after this period the dispute has not been solved , it goes to arbitration . 
If the arbitration process decides in favor of [LOC Azerbaijan  ] , then the [ORG AIOC Consortium  ] would have 90 days to rectify the material breach. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) However , [PER Home  ] said that [ORG SOCAR  ] has been threatening to take action that is outside the [MISC PSA’s  ] dispute resolution mechanism , to include unilaterally shortening the amount of time the [ORG Consortium  ] has to respond or rectify once material breach has been declared ( perhaps to ten days or even shorter ) . <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Additionally , [PER Home  ] said that [ORG SOCAR  ] has repeatedly warned the [ORG Consortium  ] to “look at [LOC Kazakhstan  ] , ” i.e. explicitly and repeatedly hinted at taking extra-legal actions if the [ORG Consortium  ] does not give in on key issues ( Comment: [ORG SOCAR  ] VP [PER Nasirov  ] has made the same point , saying [LOC BAKU  ] 00001268 002 OF 004 that the [ORG Consortium  ] should realize that “no international energy company has ever won a fight against the home country national oil company.” ) [PER SCHRADER  ] TRIED FOR SMUGGLING/STEALING ------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) More worrisome to the [ORG Consortium  ] and to [ORG BP  ] , [ORG Homesaid  ] that [ORG SOCAR  ] President [PER Abdullayev  ] has threatened to unilaterally calculate the split of profit oil , declare any excess amounts being received by the [ORG Consortium  ] as contraband , and then have [ORG BP Azerbaijan  ] President [PER Schrader  ] charged with smuggling and brought before the [ORG National Parliament  ] to be tried for “stealing ten billion dollars worth of [MISC Azerbaijani  ] oil.” SOCAR: [ORG BP  ] BROKE [ORG PSA  ] ------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) In an October 18 discussion with the Ambassador , [ORG SOCAR  ] President [PER Rovnaq Abdullayev  ] said that the [MISC AIOC’s  ] proposed revision of the method of calculating the Rate of Return ( [ORG ROR  ] ) was “against all market rules and regulations.” Although [ORG SOCAR  ] had originally agreed to negotiate with [ORG AIOC  ] , its “deception” in seeking to “change the PSA” caused [PER Abdullayev  ] to suspend talks on all future projects . 
[PER Abdullayev  ] said that the unanticipated high oil prices had caused a greedy [ORG AIOC  ] consortium to seek to illegally change the [ORG ROR  ] - “if oil had stayed at 30-40 dollars per barrel , the final flip in profit splitting would occur in 2012 , but with the rise in price , [ORG BP  ] claimed mistakes in its previous [ORG ROR  ] calculation and changed the methodology , “which it had been using for a decade.” XXXXXXXXXXXX <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [ORG SOCAR  ] President [PER Rovnaq Abdullayev  ] also said that the [ORG AIOC Consortium  ] was using ACG Associated gas “as a weapon against us , ” trying to “blackmail” [ORG SOCAR  ] by cutting deliveries from 3 billion cubic meters annually ( bcm/a ) to 1.4 bcm/a . 
However , the [MISC AIOC’s  ] cutting off of surplus [MISC ACG  ] associated gas deliveries would only hurt [LOC Georgia  ] , as it meant that [LOC Azerbaijan  ] would no longer be able to meet all of [LOC Georgia’s  ] winter gas needs , as it intended to do had the [ORG AIOC Consortium  ] continued to deliver 8.5 million cubic meters/day ( mcm/d ) , vice the current daily delivery to [ORG SOCAR  ] of 4 million mcm . 
[PER Abdullayev  ] also said that the Consortium’s actions were helping [LOC Russia  ] , who was claiming that “Azerbaijan doesn’t even have enough gas to supply [LOC Georgia  ] , ” which would indeed be the case if and only if the [ORG AIOC  ] continued to “punish” [LOC Azerbaijan  ] by withholding [MISC ACG  ] associated gas . 
Although [ORG GOAJ  ] had planned to meet all of [LOC Georgia’s  ] winter gas needs , with the [MISC AIOC’s  ] lessening of gas supplies this would no longer be possible - politically , [LOC Azerbaijan  ] could not burn mazut that sells for an equivalent of [ORG USD  ] 450 per thousand cubic meters to sell gas to [LOC Georgia  ] at approximately [ORG USD  ] 167/tcm . 
[PER Abdullayev  ] said [ORG SOCAR  ] experts disputed [ORG AIOC  ] claims that this gas being withheld from [ORG SOCAR  ] was needed for re-injection , saying that re-injection of an additional 4 mcm/d into the [MISC ACG  ] field would make “no difference” relative to the approximately 800 thousand barrels a day being extracted. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Ambassador Derse said that while the [ORG USG  ] cannot and does not take any position in the commercial negotiations between the [ORG AIOC Consortium  ] and [LOC Azerbaijan  ] , [LOC Azerbaijan  ] has been exemplary in its devotion to the sanctity of the [ORG PSAs  ] it has signed , all of which have the force of law in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] . 
This commitment to the [ORG PSAs  ] has resulted in rapid development of [MISC Azerbaijan’s  ] energy sector . 
As such , regardless of the outcome of the commercial negotiations , the [LOC U.S.  ] hoped both sides adhere to the [ORG PSA  ] and seek to address all concerns solely by the manners stipulated within the [ORG PSA  ] . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX [ORG BP  ] - “ACTING W/IN THE PSA” -------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) In an October 19 talk with the Ambassador , [ORG BP Azerbaijan  ] President [PER Bill Schrader  ] said that if [ORG BP  ] were to [LOC BAKU  ] 00001268 003 OF 004 accede to [ORG SOCAR  ] demands in an attempt to solve its dispute , it could be sued by any [ORG AIOC  ] partner for acting outside the [ORG PSA.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Schrader  ] said that the [ORG Consortium  ] had “19 disputed areas” about which it had asked for guidance from [ORG SOCAR  ] , but all it got was either “silence or threats” from [PER Abdullayev  ] , whom he characterized as a “pit bull.” [PER Schrader  ] was convinced that [PER Abdullayev  ] was “doing President [PER Aliyev’s bidding”  ] in seeking to “box it out” with the [ORG Consortium  ] for the approximately ten billion dollars at stake . 
To him , the bottom line was that [ORG SOCAR  ] “didn’t like the [ORG PSA  ] it signed” in 1994 , and was seeking to change its terms . 
He confirmed what Home had said earlier , i.e. , that [PER Abdullayev  ] had threatened to arrest and try [PER Schrader  ] in front of Parliament for being a “criminal smuggler.” <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Schrader  ] said that [ORG BP Azerbaijan  ] had already prepared for such an eventuality . 
If [ORG SOCAR  ] went public with charges of malfeasance against [ORG BP  ] , [ORG BP  ] would keep a “low profile , ” repeating the simple message that everything it had done was consistent with the [ORG PSA  ] . 
[PER Schrader  ] argued that the putative “change in methodology in [ORG ROR  ] calculation” was not a change at all - before revenue started flowing the methodology being used for pro forma profit calculation runs had a flaw in it , which was corrected when the partners became aware of it and before the revenue stream started. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Referring to the [ORG AIOC Steering Committee  ] meeting to be held later that day , [PER Schrader  ] said he thought it unlikely that [PER Abdullayev  ] would formally claim that the [ORG AIOC Consortium  ] was in material breach , as that would start [ORG SOCAR  ] down a road that it didn’t want to go , since the overwhelming likelihood of any arbitration would be in favor of the [ORG Consortium  ] - “Azerbaijan doesn’t want any experts involved in this matter.” [PER Schrader  ] quoted what [MISC Chevron  ] CEO [PER David O’Reilly  ] had heard from President [PER Aliyev  ] when they had recently met , to the effect that [LOC Azerbaijan  ] was going to receive approximately [ORG USD  ] 200 billion of oil revenue over the next 15 years - it was not going to embarrass itself for an extra ten billion.” BP’s [LOC London  ] experts familiar with the [ORG GOAJ  ] have similarly told [ORG BP Azerbaijan  ] that [ORG SOCAR  ] is unlikely to act upon is threats. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) In this regard , [ORG BP  ] Vice-President [PER Phil Home  ] said that [MISC Moody’s  ] was planning to come to [LOC Azerbaijan  ] in two weeks , and had asked to talk with him about [MISC Azerbaijan’s  ] investment climate , and he mused aloud as to what he should tell them given the Consortium’s current difficulties. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) XXXXXXXXXXXX <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [PER Schrader  ] said that the [ORG AIOC  ] partners were all in agreement as to the correct course of action . 
He predicted that [ORG SOCAR  ] would “set the dogs on us , ” i.e. , seek to make operations much more difficult for the [ORG Consortium  ] . 
If this were to happen , he would keep record of every penny of additional expense incurred , send it in a monthly letter to [ORG SOCAR  ] , and seek to cost-recover it all , in line with the [ORG PSA  ] provisions for recovery via allocation of “cost oil.” <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) Speaking of the longer-term issues of [ORG PSA  ] extension and access to [ORG ACG Deep Gas  ] , for political reasons he thought it unlikely that President [PER Aliyev  ] would move on them before being re-elected as President . 
[ORG SOCAR  ] BACKS DOWN ---------------- <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) After the October 19 [ORG AIOC Steering Committee  ] meeting , [PER Schrader  ] said that the meeting itself had turned out to be a “non-event.” [ORG SOCAR  ] head [PER Abdullayev  ] read prepared remarks in which he railed against [ORG BP  ] and the [ORG Consortium  ] , but he did not seek to claim material breech . 
He did tell the [ORG Consortium  ] that they “had a week to resolve all outstanding issues , ” but [LOC BAKU  ] 00001268 004 OF 004 did not specify any adverse consequences for not doing so . 
[PER Schrader  ] said that obviously it would be impossible to meet [MISC Abdullayev’s  ] deadline , but that the [ORG AIOC  ] partners were going to offer to form a working group to meet with [ORG SOCAR  ] to work on these issues . 
He confirmed that one of SOCAR’s demands was that [ORG BP  ] yield operator status of the [ORG BTC  ] to [ORG SOCAR  ] , to do away with the putative “conflict of interest” due to [ORG BP  ] being operator of both [ORG ACG  ] and [ORG BTC  ] . 
[PER Schrader  ] said that [ORG BP  ] Head of Exploration and Production [PER Andy Inglis  ] would be coming to [LOC Azerbaijan  ] on October 29 to meet with President [PER Aliyev.  ] <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) [ORG SOFAZ  ] head [PER Shahmar Movsumov  ] , who attended the [ORG Steering Committee  ] meeting , afterwards told the Ambassador that [PER Abdullayev  ] had laid out the [MISC GOAJ’s  ] grievances in a ninety minute recitation , and that [LOC Azerbaijan  ] was not going to “just roll over and take BP’s line.” However , he confirmed that [LOC Azerbaijan  ] would work to resolve the disputes within the [ORG PSA.  ] <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) COMMENT: [ORG BP  ] President [PER Schrader  ] told the Ambassador that when he got here a year ago , [MISC Azerbaijan’s  ] operating environment seemed “benign” compared to his previous assignments , to include [LOC Angola  ] . 
Although BP’s situation is not as “benign” as a year ago , SOCAR’s decision not to escalate its dispute with the [ORG Consortium  ] is a promising sign that a mutually satisfactory solution can be reached , thus clearing the way for [ORG PSA  ] extension and access to [ORG ACG Deep Gas  ] , both prerequisites for the second stage of [MISC Azerbaijani  ] energy sector development . 
Embassy will continue to monitor events and press for a negotiating environment in which a mutually satisfactory conclusion can be reached .
