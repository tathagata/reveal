Prime Minister [PER Raises Tax  ] and Bonuses with Ambassador --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) Prime Minister [PER Brown  ] continues to press hard for international adoption of some form of a [ORG Tobin Tax  ] on financial transactions , despite being fully aware of [LOC U.S.  ] opposition to the tax . 
In recent speeches to major business groups , at the [LOC Commonwealth Summit  ] , and in press conferences , the PM has emphasized that a [ORG Tobin Tax  ] must be among the options explored to ensure that taxpayers do not bear the cost of future bank bailouts . 
The Prime Minister has raised this issue several times with Ambassador [PER Susman  ] , most recently during the [MISC Ambassador’s  ] call to discuss the [LOC Afghanistan  ] strategy on November 30 , and in a Thanksgiving call from the PM to the Ambassador . 
The Prime Minister has stated that he saw coordination of our actions on [LOC Afghanistan  ] and financial services as the cornerstones of the [MISC UK-U.S.  ] bilateral relationship , and has expressed disappointment that on the latter , the [LOC U.S.  ] has not been as supportive as he had hoped . 
We expect that the PM will become emboldened to push harder for the tax after France’s Foreign Minister [PER Kouchner  ] , at the [LOC Copenhagen  ] [MISC COP-15  ] , proposed a .0005 percent tax on financial transactions to fund poverty reduction and combating climate change in developing countries. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) The Prime Minister also has raised with the Ambassador the issue of bank bonuses , and has repeatedly queried what the [LOC U.S.  ] government position would be if [ORG Goldman Sachs  ] , among others , announced large bonuses . 
The issue of bonuses is coming to a head in the [LOC UK  ] this week , with the Chancellor announcing new measures during his December 9 pre-budget report . 
This issue will reported septel . 
Background - [PER Brown  ] at [LOC St. Andrews  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) During the November 6-7 G-20 Ministerial in [LOC St. Andrews  ] , Prime Minister [PER Brown  ] unexpectedly focused on the [ORG Tobin Tax  ] - a tax on financial transactions - as one of the key measures that should be explored to ensure that financial institutions , and not taxpayers , would in the future bear the costs of risks they take . 
As reported in reftel , the Prime Minister , Chancellor [PER Darling  ] and other HMG officials had been previously informed about the [LOC U.S.  ] opposition to such a tax . 
However , the [MISC PM’s  ] staff nevertheless highlighted the tax in pre-briefing the press on his speech , a strategy that backfired when the press focused on the lack of support from the [LOC U.S.  ] , other governments and the [ORG IMF  ] . 
( Comment: We believed at the time that the [MISC PM’s  ] close advisor , [PER Shriti Vadera  ] , who no longer is officially working in government , was behind the push for the [ORG Tobin Tax  ] . 
Recently , [PER Roland Rudd  ] , head of the think-tank Business for a [ORG New Europe  ] and well-connected in the [ORG Labour Party  ] , verified that [PER Vadera  ] was the invisible hand behind the scenes . 
End Comment . 
) Immediately after the meeting in [LOC St. Andrews  ] , the Prime Minister called the Ambassador and expressed his disappointment that Treasury Secretary [PER Geithner  ] had so publicly declined to support the [MISC PM’s  ] proposal . 
[ORG Continuous Campaign  ] ------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC SBU/NF  ] ) The Prime Minister , Chancellor [PER Darling  ] and [ORG Financial Services Authority  ] Chairman [PER Lord Turner  ] have , since [LOC St. Andrews  ] , continued to draw attention to the [ORG Tobin Tax  ] . 
In a November 25 , [LOC Commonwealth Summit Press Briefing  ] , the PM stated , that to make banks more accountable , “we can look at an insurance scheme ; we can look at the creation of resolution funds ; we can look at asking banks to hold more capital ; we can look at global levy on transactions” and that he would raise these options with his [ORG Commonwealth  ] partners . 
In his November 23 speech to the [ORG Confederation of British Industry  ] , [PER Brown  ] also emphasized the “global levy” as an option to rebuild trust between “banks and the societies” they serve . 
[PER Turner  ] in a speech at the [MISC British  ] Embassy in [LOC Paris  ] on November 30 said that policy-makers “should not exclude consideration of taxes on financial transactions.” He also acknowledged , however , the limitations of such a tax . 
It would not prevent all or even most of the “rent extraction” in the financial sector , nor would it would create the perfect amount of liquidity in the system . 
[PER Darling  ] in a [ORG BBC  ] radio interview on November 8 admitted that it would be difficult to reach an international agreement on a global banking tax , but it was an idea that had to be considered . 
Opposition Joins the Bandwagon ------------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [ORG Labour Party  ] officials are not the only ones expressing disappointment with the [LOC U.S.  ] position on the [ORG Tobin Tax  ] . 
Baroness [PER Shirley Williams  ] and [PER Lord Paddy Ashcroft  ] , two respected [MISC Liberal Democrats  ] , recently told emboffs that they were bewildered and disappointed by [LOC U.S.  ] opposition . 
[ORG Conservative Party  ] leaders have not addressed the [ORG Tobin Tax  ] in their position papers or remarks . 
Opposition leader [PER David Cameron  ] did state in a November 19 press conference that “the problem with the [ORG Tobin Tax  ] is that if we applied it here and others didn’t follow , we would lose lots of companies that would simply go elsewhere . 
It is important to remember that financial services is not just the [LOC City  ] - there are hundreds of thousands of people employed in banks , building societies and insurance firms throughout the country.” <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) The [LOC UK  ] financial sector has been rather muted in its comments , preferring to remain silent unless and until the government makes an actual proposal . 
JP Morgan officials told us that the firm is opposed to the idea of a [ORG Tobin  ] tax and is particularly concerned about the difficulty of implementation , which would need to be universal to avoid regulatory arbitrage . 
They also said there would be intense lobbying to exempt some transactions from a tax , predicting that [LOC U.S.  ] treasuries , other government bonds and sovereign debt would be excluded from such a tax . 
The tax would be even more discriminatory since it would only target transactions of private firms and individuals. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) Comment: The Prime Minister’s position is largely being driven by domestic politics , as a way to be seen as “punishing the banks.” But there is also an element of social justice and a need to fill a gaping budget deficit . 
The recent announcement by the [MISC French  ] FM plays on the social justice aspect . 
We expect the PM will continue to press this issue , and will criticize the [LOC U.S.  ] if it gets no further international traction .
