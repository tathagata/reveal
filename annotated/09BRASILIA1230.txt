( C ) Summary . 
During an October 1 meeting with poloff , [ORG Ministry of Foreign Relations  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] or [ORG Itamaraty  ] ) [LOC Central Asia  ] ( including [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Pakistan  ] , [LOC India  ] ) Director [PER Ricardo Luis Pires Ribeiro  ] da [PER Silva  ] acknowledged that the September 24 report to the [ORG IAEA  ] on the [LOC Qom  ] nuclear facility challenges [LOC Brazil  ] 's prevailing outlook that [LOC Iran  ] is building a nuclear program primarily for civilian purposes . 
[PER Pires  ] shared his readout of President [PER Lula  ] 's September 23 meeting with [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  ] at [ORG UNGA  ] , and emphasized that neither [PER Lula  ] nor [ORG Itamaraty  ] knew anything substantive about the [LOC Qom  ] report in advance of the meeting . 
[PER Pires  ] said that [ORG Itamaraty  ] was particularly concerned that [LOC Israel  ] would strike against the [LOC Qom  ] facility quickly , even before sanctions could be agreed upon , if the [LOC Geneva  ] talks did not appear to produce tangible results . 
In follow-up correspondence , [PER Pires  ] praised the [ORG USG  ] for holding extended talks with [LOC Iran  ] in [LOC Geneva  ] . 
End summary . 
[ORG Qom Nuclear Facility  ] -------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Pires  ] , who had a chance to review the September 24 [ORG IAEA  ] presentation talking points several days in advance of the meeting and confer with senior [ORG MRE  ] officials about them , noted quickly and often that the [LOC Qom  ] enrichment plant is different in nature from the [LOC Natanz  ] enrichment plant . 
While he believed that [LOC Qom  ] production levels could be viewed as suitable for research rather than weaponmaking , [PER Pires  ] feared that [LOC Israel  ] would see the facility as an imminent threat even if access to [ORG IAEA  ] inspectors were granted . 
He said the [ORG GOB  ] believes [LOC Israel  ] has a date in mind for bombing the facility if the [LOC Geneva  ] talks fail or if strong sanctions are not established , and sought [ORG USG  ] assurances that [LOC Israel  ] would not take action soon . 
[PER Pires  ] reiterated support for the current [ORG USG  ] approach to [MISC Israel-Palestine  ] negotiations , but wondered if we were taking a harder line on [LOC Iran  ] to keep the [MISC Israelis  ] happy so that they would make concessions on [LOC West Bank  ] settlements. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [LOC Iran  ] can be convinced to agree to a thorough [ORG IAEA  ] inspection of the [LOC Qom  ] facility , [PER Pires  ] said , though he acknowledged that this would not necessarily resolve concerns about the facility 's ultimate use . 
He believed that [LOC Russia  ] would ultimately side with the [LOC United States  ] , [LOC United Kingdom  ] , and [LOC France  ] on the core approach to [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program , including a future decision to impose sanctions , which would place pressure on [LOC China  ] to follow suit . 
He suggested that [LOC Brazil  ] will be watching [LOC Russia  ] closely for clues about how to position itself on the issue in the [ORG UN  ] . 
[PER Pires  ] characterized [LOC Iran  ] 's recent missile launch as " really stupid " and needlessly provocative to [LOC Israel  ] especially , but also to countries like [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC India  ] , and [LOC Turkey  ] . 
He believed there was a good chance that [LOC Iran  ] had received technological upgrades from [LOC North Korea  ] since their last missile launch . 
[PER Lula  ] and [PER Ahmadinejad  ] at [ORG UNGA  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Pires  ] also shared [ORG MRE  ] 's readout of President [PER Lula  ] 's one-hour meeting with [PER Ahmadinejad  ] at [ORG UNGA  ] on September 23 , emphasizing several times that [PER Lula  ] told [PER Ahmadinejad  ] that [ORG IAEA  ] access to all nuclear facilities will be needed to show that they will be used for civilian energy purposes . 
He said that [PER Lula  ] emerged from the meeting enthusiastic about developing further commercial relations with [LOC Iran  ] and skeptical about reports of nuclear weaponmaking , as reported in the press . 
[PER Pires  ] emphasized , however , that [PER Lula  ] was not aware at the time of the forthcoming report to [ORG IAEA  ] about the [LOC Qom  ] facility , or at least not about the report 's content . 
[PER Pires  ] also said that [PER Lula  ] asked [PER Ahmadinejad  ] about the Holocaust toward the end of the meeting . 
According to the [ORG GOB  ] report , [PER Ahmadinejad  ] acknowledged that it did , in fact , occur , and then went on a diatribe about [LOC Germany  ] and the creation of the state of [LOC Israel  ] . 
[PER Pires  ] described [PER Lula  ] 's response to a reporter 's subsequent question on [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's recognition of the Holocaust as " unfortunate and not representative " of the discussion at the meeting . 
[LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001230 002.2 OF 002 O ther Issues: Visitors , [ORG UNESCO  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG MRE  ] reconfirmed that [MISC Israeli  ] President [PER Shimon Peres  ] will visit [LOC Brasilia  ] on November 11 . 
He said that no dates had been confirmed for visits by [PER Ahmadinejad  ] or [MISC Palestinian  ] President [PER Mahmoud Abbas  ] , but said that the [PER Ahmadinejad  ] visit will happen in late November , which would push back the [PER Abbas  ] visit into December at earliest. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Pires  ] also spoke briefly about [LOC Brazil  ] 's decision to back [MISC Egyptian  ] candidate [PER Farouk Hosni  ] over [PER Irina Bokova  ] for the [ORG UNESCO  ] Director General ( ref B ) . 
Several local publications have criticized the [ORG GOB  ] position on this matter , calling it a " diplomatic defeat " dictated by [PER Lula  ] 's desire to strengthen relations with [LOC Iran  ] and the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
These same reports , apparently based on leaked sources from [ORG Itamaraty  ] , also questioned why [LOC Brazil  ] did not make the case to promote one of its own , [ORG UNESCO  ] Deputy Director-General [PER Marcio Barbosa  ] . 
When asked about the matter , [PER Pires  ] smiled wryly , shook his head and said , " these are the things we have to do sometimes .
