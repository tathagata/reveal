( C ) The [MISC Serbian  ] government 's cooperation with the [ORG International Criminal Tribunal  ] for the [LOC Former Yugoslavia  ] has increased since parliamentary elections in May and took a dramatic step forward just after the July formation of the new government with the arrest of wartime [MISC Bosnian Serb  ] political leader [PER Radovan Karadzic  ] . 
The new government , unhindered by uncooperative [ORG Democratic Party of Serbia  ] officials in the [ORG Security Information Agency  ] and the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] , appears better able to investigate the fugitives' whereabouts and act on leads . 
Cross-border information sharing with [ORG NATO  ] in [LOC Bosnia  ] has also enhanced the government 's capabilities . 
The new , pro-Western government , which ran on an [ORG EU  ] integration platform , clearly has the will to fulfill [LOC Serbia  ] , s cooperation obligations . 
Political leaders are for the first time talking about the moral obligation to apprehend fugitives , not just the economic benefits of joining the [ORG EU  ] . 
While technical cooperation , including providing wartime documents and finding witness , will continue until the [ORG Tribunal  ] concludes its work , the government will need to make good on its promise to capture and extradite the remaining fugitives and close that chapter of its cooperation obligations once and for all . 
End Summary . 
Government Cooperation Increased -------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Following parliamentary elections in May , the [MISC Serbian  ] government stepped up activity to locate and arrest the remaining four fugitives indicted for war crimes by the [ORG International Criminal Tribunal  ] for the [LOC Former Yugoslavia  ] ( [ORG ICTY  ] ) . 
The [MISC Serbian  ] government arrested two of the remaining four [ORG ICTY  ] fugitives , [PER Karadzic  ] advisor [PER Stojan Zupljanin  ] on June 11 ( Ref A ) , as coalition negotiations were being finalized , and [PER Karadzic  ] himself on July 21 , just two weeks after the formation of the new [MISC Democratic Party-led  ] coalition government ( Ref B ) . 
[PER Karadzic  ] 's arrest fueled speculation that the new , [MISC European-oriented  ] government would soon arrest [MISC Bosnian Serb  ] wartime military leader [PER Ratko Mladic  ] , who is accused of master-minding and executing the mass execution of [MISC Bosnian Muslims  ] during five years of war in [LOC Bosnia  ] . 
Observers had long thought that the arrests of [PER Karadzic  ] and [PER Mladic  ] , the best known of the remaining four indictees , would be the most difficult politically for the government given that many [MISC Serbs  ] still deny that the atrocities for which they are accused took place. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) On October 8 , the office of the [MISC War Crimes  ] Prosecutor announced that it had summoned for questioning seven individuals suspected of helping hide [PER Zupljanin  ] . 
[MISC War Crimes  ] Prosecutor spokesman [PER Bruno Vekaric  ] said the individuals were identified in a police investigation into [PER Zupljanin  ] 's support network , which revealed links to the support networks of other [ORG ICTY  ] fugitives , including [PER Mladic  ] and [PER Karadzic  ] . 
The investigation had already yielded 30 names , and the operation would continue for several more days , according to the statement . 
( Note: the [MISC War Crimes Court  ] has its own police unit . 
) [MISC War Crimes  ] Prosecutor [PER Vladimir Vukcevic  ] told us privately that the first interrogated suspect , former [ORG Vojvodina Executive Council  ] President [PER Koviljko Lovre  ] , admitted to assisting [PER Zupljanin  ] . 
New Government More Capable and Willing --------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Observers have long speculated whether the previous government knew where [PER Karadzic  ] and [PER Mladic  ] were . 
Many believed that the previous government had enough information to locate the fugitives had it undertaken a vigorous investigation . 
Details that have been surfacing about the arrest of [PER Karadzic  ] suggest this may be true . 
B92 reported on September 29 that [ORG Security Information Agency  ] ( [ORG BIA  ] ) director [PER Rade Bulatovic  ] ( [ORG DSS  ] ) had had information on [PER Karadzic  ] 's whereabouts for months . 
Both [PER Bulatovic  ] and former [ORG DSS  ] Prime Minister [PER Kostunica  ] publicly denied that they had known [PER Karadzic  ] 's whereabouts . 
A close advisor of Deputy Prime Minister [PER Ivica Dacic  ] told us that [PER Bulatovic  ] had received the information six months before the new government formed but did not act on it , because of [ORG DSS  ] Prime Minister [PER Kostunica  ] 's [ORG BELGRADE  ] 00001097 002.2 OF 003 ideological kinship with [PER Karadzic  ] and a lack of international pressure . 
When the government changed , [PER Bulatovic  ] had presented the information -- in exchange for the promise of an ambassadorship -- to [PER Tadic  ] and his [ORG National Security Advisor Miki Rakic  ] , who then planned the arrest ( Ref C ) . 
( Note: There are rumors that [PER Bulatovic  ] will be appointed as Ambassador to [LOC Syria  ] . 
) [ORG National Council for Cooperation  ] with the [ORG Hague Tribunal  ] President [PER Rasim Ljajic  ] publicly affirmed that the government had begun developing information on [PER Karadzic  ] earlier -- but did not specify when -- and had arrested him when the security risk was lowest . 
[PER Vukcevic  ] told us the arrest had come after a month of tracking [PER Karadzic  ] 's support network and that only three people in the country had known about the operation in advance , including himself , new [ORG BIA  ] director [PER Sasa Vukadinovic  ] , and [ORG Rakic  ] , who reportedly orchestrated the [PER Zupljanin  ] arrest as well ( Ref D ) . <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S/NF ) Whatever the truth about when the government became aware of [PER Karadzic  ] 's whereabouts , several observers note that the absence of [ORG DSS  ] from the current coalition is key to the renewed enthusiasm for capturing the fugitives . 
[ORG Humanitarian Law Center  ] Director [PER Natasa Kandic  ] told us that with [PER Kostunica  ] gone , the [ORG DS  ] now had the political will to complete [ORG ICTY  ] cooperation . 
[ORG ICTY Belgrade  ] chief [PER Deyan Mihov  ] told us that the atmosphere at [ORG BIA  ] was completely different with [PER Sasa Vukadinovic  ] in charge ; cooperation with [ORG ICTY Belgrade  ] had improved markedly . 
[PER Mihov  ] said [PER Bulatovic  ] was evasive and " could sell you anything . 
" [PER Bulatovic  ] had consistently avoided answering [PER Mihov  ] , s questions about whether [ORG BIA  ] had collected any DNA or fingerprints in its investigations of [PER Karadzic  ] 's whereabouts . 
Our contacts with [ORG BIA  ] have also improved since [PER Vukadinovic  ] took over ; he welcomes visits from the [ORG Embassy 's Special Assistant Office  ] and has said he wants to be sure that [PER Mladic  ] is captured on [MISC Serbian  ] soil to show that [LOC Serbia  ] is a law-abiding country . 
President of the [MISC Special War Crimes Court Judge  ] [PER Sinisa Vazic  ] told us that previous Interior Minister [PER Dragan Jocic  ] ( [ORG DSS  ] ) had politicized [ORG ICTY  ] cooperation and had not operated transparently , hindering previous cases. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Mihov  ] told us he thought international pressure had in part been responsible for the government 's recent actions , but that it was clearly willing and able to complete the arrests with continued encouragement . 
According to [PER Mihov  ] , President [PER Tadic  ] told [ORG ICTY  ] Chief Prosecutor [PER Serge Brammertz  ] ( Ref E ) that he knew [LOC Serbia  ] needed to bring [PER Mladic  ] in to lift [MISC Dutch  ] opposition to [LOC Serbia  ] 's [ORG EU  ] integration , but that [LOC Serbia  ] would capture [PER Hadzic  ] as well because [ORG ICTY  ] cooperation was both a moral and legal obligation . 
[PER Mihov  ] said [PER Brammertz  ] was cautiously optimistic that [LOC Serbia  ] would capture [PER Mladic  ] within the next several months. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Vukcevic  ] 's office told us it now had better information to conduct its investigations , thanks to ongoing meetings that began in June 2008 between the [MISC War Crimes Prosecution  ] and [MISC NATO/U.S  ] . 
Corp [LOC Bosnia  ] , which post facilitated . 
[PER Vukcevic  ] said the information exchanged , particularly on the networks of supporters , enhanced [LOC Serbia  ] 's ability to search for [ORG ICTY  ] fugitives . 
Government 's Message of [ORG Moral Responsibility  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In the months since [PER Karadzic  ] 's arrest , President [PER Tadic  ] , [PER Ljajic  ] , [PER Vukcevic  ] , and other officials have made several public statements about the importance of capturing the remaining fugitives , not just for pragmatic reasons but also because of the need for reconciliation with the past . 
[ORG DS  ] Vice President [PER Dusan Petrovic  ] assured us that the government placed importance on helping the public to understand and overcome the past and promote reconciliation. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG ICTY Coordination Council  ] Director [PER Dusan Ignjatovic  ] informed us the government planned a series of public discussions to explain the events of the 1990s and the importance of [ORG ICTY  ] 's work . 
In cooperation with the [ORG OSCE  ] and [ORG ICTY Belgrade  ] , the [ORG ICTY Coordination Council  ] held its first program on August 18 in the eastern [MISC Serbian  ] town of [LOC Zajecar  ] . 
Speakers from [ORG OSCE  ] , [ORG ICTY  ] , and the [ORG Coordination Council  ] appeared on a local prime time television talk show and took calls from viewers . 
[PER Ignatovic  ] said the government was considering expanding the program to other towns and eventually broadcasting the discussions on national broadcaster Radio-Television [LOC Serbia  ] . 
He said that [MISC Serbian  ] citizens would not experience any epiphanies in their understanding of the events of the 1990s but with careful messages would eventually come to terms with the past . 
[PER Ignjatovic  ] said this message was a tough sell with most [MISC Serbs  ] , since the acquittals in 2008 of [MISC Bosniak  ] commander [ORG BELGRADE  ] 00001097 003.2 OF 003 [PER Naser Oric  ] , acquitted July 3 of murdering [MISC Serbian  ] prisoners of war , and [ORG Kosovo Liberation Army  ] commander [PER Rasmush Haradinaj  ] , acquitted April 3 of targeting and killing civilians , heightened a sense that [ORG ICTY  ] was biased against [LOC Serbia.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Mihov  ] told us the challenge for the government would be to compete with sensationalist , nationalist coverage in the tabloids , which still had a chief role in forming popular opinion . 
[PER Mihov  ] said [PER Tadic  ] had confided to [PER Brammertz  ] that he felt the government had missed an opportunity to educate people about war crimes immediately after [PER Karadzic  ] 's arrest when the tabloid press was consumed with sensationalizing details of [PER Karadzic  ] 's false identity as a natural medicine guru . 
The government needed to show [ORG ICTY  ] indictees as criminals , not heroes , [PER Mihov  ] said . 
Beyond the Arrests ------------------ <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The capture of the remaining indictees remains the most high profile aspect of [ORG ICTY  ] cooperation , but there are other important elements to [LOC Serbia  ] 's [ORG ICTY  ] cooperation , such as handing over documents to the prosecution and serving subpoenas to [ORG ICTY  ] witnesses . 
Although these elements are not as high-profile , [ORG ICTY Belgrade  ] 's [PER Mihov  ] told us it was essential for [LOC Serbia  ] to continue to cooperate in these areas in order to obtain a favorable report from [PER Brammertz  ] . 
[PER Mihov  ] said [LOC Serbia  ] was mostly compliant with this technical cooperation . 
For the most part [LOC Serbia  ] was complying with document requests , he said , although [ORG ICTY  ] had had to go to court to obtain some national security-related documents . 
The government was still holding out on one document , but [PER Mihov  ] had high expectations of receiving it . 
[PER Mihov  ] said there were also some issues with locating witnesses but most were not contentious . 
He added that the [ORG ICTY  ] had no complaints about how the government was handling allegations of witness intimidation . 
According to the war crimes prosecution 's statement on the investigation into [PER Zupljanin  ] 's network , one of the elements under investigation was witness intimidation. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Serbia  ] is also prosecuting a number of war crimes cases domestically . 
[MISC War Crimes Court President Judge  ] [PER Sinisa Vazic  ] told us that cases in the war crimes special court were proceeding slowly , in large part due to space issues . 
[PER Vazic  ] said there was not enough space to handle the 11 ongoing war crimes trials and 25 ongoing investigations . 
( Note: The war crimes court , built with [ORG USG  ] technical and financial support , has only three courtrooms equipped for multi-defendant trials and only two courtrooms for investigative interviews , and it shares this space with the [ORG Corruption Special Court  ] . 
The courtrooms operate in two shifts , but each case can be heard only threeto four days per month . 
) [PER Vukcevic  ] told us he was proud he had made significant progress in 2008 on several cases that had previously been moving slowly , including the [LOC Zvornik  ] , [LOC Lovas  ] , [ORG Bytyqi Brothers  ] , [LOC Suva Reka  ] , and [MISC Ovcara  ] cases . 
Comment ------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( S ) We welcome the shift in the government 's message that [ORG ICTY  ] cooperation will not only bring economic rewards -- which opinion polls show to be the biggest concern of [MISC Serbian  ] citizens -- but is also a moral obligation . 
The new government at least is talking about shared values with the [LOC West  ] and being a good neighbor . 
Having gone to great lengths to demonstrate its will to capture and hand over the remaining fugitives , the [MISC Serbian  ] government now needs to deliver . 
There is a window of opportunity of high expectations . 
If [LOC Serbia  ] wishes to reap the rewards of [MISC European  ] integration and truly move beyond its painful past , now is the time to make the final push in seeking out and capturing these fugitives . 
Whether for pragmatic or more elevated reasons , we now believe the government will do its utmost to bring in [LOC Mladic  ] and [PER Hadzic  ] .
