( C ) The [ORG GoA  ] is reportedly hardening its policy on the [LOC Falkland/Malvinas Islands  ] in response to accelerating oil exploration efforts under [MISC British  ] authority that lack [MISC Argentine  ] participation or consent . 
According to local press reports , the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] has created a plan to press [LOC Argentina  ] 's historic claim to the islands which involves expressing displeasure to the [LOC UK  ] , to any companies involved , and to the governments of the companies' home countries . 
This could involve the [ORG USG  ] , since an [MISC American  ] supplier is sending a drilling rig to the islands . 
These steps follow a 2007 resolution which threatens to cut off the [MISC Argentine  ] operations of any oil company that operates in the [LOC Falklands  ] without [ORG GoA  ] permission . 
[MISC British  ] diplomats in [LOC Argentina  ] are not sure how far the [ORG GoA  ] will take these threats , and do not rule out an " irrational " response . 
At present , no [LOC U.S.  ] energy company operating in [LOC Argentina  ] appears to be considering activity in the [LOC Falklands  ] . 
End Summary . 
Keep Your [ORG Oil Equipment Away  ] from [LOC Our Islands  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Argentine  ] press reports on January 27 state that the [MISC Argentine  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] ( [ORG MFA  ] ) has developed a plan to resist oil exploration in the [LOC Falklands/Malvinas  ] islands located to the east of southern [LOC Argentina  ] , a territory claimed by the [MISC Argentines  ] and the [MISC British  ] , but controlled by the [MISC British  ] . 
[MISC British  ] firm [ORG Desire Petroleum  ] is reportedly moving a drilling rig to the area to drill exploratory wells . 
The [ORG GoA  ] plans to assert that " any hydrocarbons operation in the [LOC Malvinas  ] area linked to the [LOC UK  ] is 'illegal' because , by authorizing it , the [LOC UK  ] government is assuming competency in areas of the continental shelf which are subject to [MISC Argentine  ] jurisdiction and sovereignty . 
" The [ORG GoA  ] has reportedly planned three courses of action: a formal protest to the [LOC UK  ] ; sending " notes of discouragement " to each company involved in such activities , advising them that their actions are " illegal " and they could therefore face legal sanctions ; and , in the case where companies are not [MISC British  ] , sending protest notes to the corresponding government ( s ) signaling [ORG GoA  ] concern over the " illegal " activities and noting possible sanctions . 
The [ORG USG  ] could receive a note under the third category because the [LOC U.S.  ] firm [ORG Diamond Drilling  ] owns a drilling rig en route to the islands ( and expected to be in place by mid-February ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The above [ORG GoA  ] policy would be consistent with [ORG Energy Secretariat Resolution  ] 407 issued in 2007 , which threatens to terminate the [MISC Argentine  ] activities ( including the cancellation of all energy concessions ) of any company that operates in the [LOC Falklands  ] area without express [ORG GoA  ] permission . 
Energy analyst [PER Daniel Gerold  ] sees little chance of [ORG GoA  ] sanctions against companies while the process remains in the exploration stage . 
However , in the event of a significant hydrocarbons discovery ( either petroleum or natural gas , which he believes is more likely ) , [PER Gerold  ] foresees the [ORG GoA  ] making it " a major issue , " as more companies become involved in the extraction process -- and as the [ORG GoA  ] perceives it is missing out on a significant revenue stream . 
What Next ? 
[PER Brits Concerned  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [LOC Argentina  ] launched the first diplomatic shot across the [MISC British  ] bow on February 2 ; [MISC British  ] diplomats in [LOC Argentina  ] confirmed to EconOff that the [ORG GoA  ] delivered a formal protest to their [ORG ChargC  ] ) that afternoon . 
[LOC UK  ] political Officers [PER Lynda St Cooke  ] and [PER Oliver Moss  ] ( the latter a former [ORG Shell Oil  ] employee ) previously told EconOff January 28 that , while such a protest was expected and routine ( they receive numerous Falklands-related communications from the [ORG GoA  ] each year ) , they were still concerned over where [ORG GoA  ] actions might lead . 
Their concern is over the shape of future sanctions on companies as well as threats and protests against energy companies operating in the [LOC Falklands  ] by [ORG NGOs  ] , including environmental activists. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) On possible sanctions , [PER St Cooke  ] believes that the [ORG GoA  ] will seek to " make an example " of a company if possible , and she wondered what would happen if the first company to cross the " line in the sand " were one with significant activities in [LOC Argentina  ] . 
She cited [ORG Schlumberger  ] as an example of a company which could provide services for oil extraction in the [LOC Falklands  ] , given its extensive global operations , including within [LOC Argentina  ] . 
She noted that stopping its [MISC Argentine  ] operations would be very detrimental to [MISC Argentine  ] hydrocarbons production . 
While pursuing such an action would be " irrational " for the [ORG GoA  ] , she said , " We can't rule it out . 
" She added that this is a very one-sided issue in [LOC Argentina  ] . 
Since there are virtually no advocates for relinquishing [LOC Argentina  ] 's claim to the islands , which is taught as sacred writ to [MISC Argentine  ] children beginning in elementary school , there could be significant political pressure on the [ORG GoA  ] to take action in case of an oil discovery . 
[PER Gerold  ] agreed and suggested that , following a significant hydrocarbon find , the [ORG GoA  ] would quickly seek to begin operations in its ( undisputed ) Exclusive Economic Zone ( [ORG EEZ  ] ) as close as possible to the location of the find. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC U.S.  ] companies currently operating in [LOC Argentina  ] have not indicated an interest to participate in current exploration activities near the [LOC Falklands  ] ; [PER Randy Smith  ] , [ORG ExxonMobil  ] 's Public and [ORG Government Affairs Manager  ] , told Econoff January 29 that his company is not interested. . 
Comment <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Although the budget-strapped [MISC Argentine  ] military is ill-prepared for any course of action involving projection of power , the [ORG GoA  ] would likely feel compelled by a significant hydrocarbon find to press [LOC Argentina  ] 's historic claims by any other possible means . 
A strategy of tough talk , complaints in international fora , and protest letters is likely , with economic sanctions against participating companies possible , even if they might damage [LOC Argentina  ] 's own hydrocarbons output .
