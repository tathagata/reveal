The [MISC Ukrainian  ] Ambassador was reportedly told by [MISC Libyan  ] officials that the [ORG GOL  ] was frankly skeptical about the proposed deals because of tension between the [MISC Ukrainian  ] Prime Minister and President and the perception that [LOC Ukraine  ] was not a stable investment venue . 
End Summary . 
AGREEMENTS SIGNED <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) During the mid-May visit of [MISC Ukrainian  ] Prime Minister [PER Yulia Tymoshenko  ] to [LOC Libya  ] , the two countries signed agreements on military-technical cooperation , sharing sensitive information , civilian nuclear cooperation , sharing sensitive information and higher education . 
[MISC Russian  ] DCM [PER Anatoly Martynov  ] told P/E Chief in early June that he had received a readout from [LOC Ukraine  ] 's Ambassador to [LOC Tripoli  ] shortly after [PER Tymoshenko  ] 's visit . 
The military-technical agreement had been under discussion since 2004 and provided a basic framework for military cooperation and training . 
[LOC Ukraine  ] wanted to sign it during the March 2008 visit to [LOC Tripoli  ] of [LOC Ukraine  ] 's President , but the [MISC Libyan  ] side was unprepared to do so . 
During [PER Tymoshenko  ] 's visit , the [MISC Ukrainian  ] side also proposed establishing a center in [LOC Libya  ] to refurbish [MISC Soviet-era Mi-8  ] helicopters ; however , the [ORG GOL  ] deferred a decision . 
The protocol on the exchange of sensitive information was described as essentially being an agreement by both sides not to disclose military or intelligence information obtained from the other without securing prior permission to do so. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The nuclear energy cooperation agreement was discussed during the March 2008 visit by [LOC Ukraine  ] 's president . 
[LOC Libya  ] has already signed a civilian nuclear cooperation agreement wtih [LOC France  ] and a memorandum of understanding with [LOC Russia  ] that commits [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC Libya  ] to conclude a formal cooperation agreement on civilian uses of nuclear energy . 
( Note: [LOC Libya  ] 's efforts to establish nuclear power generating capability do not appear to be moving quickly . 
Dr. [PER Mohammed Ennami  ] , Deputy Director of [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG Atomic Energy Establishment  ] , told Econoff that [MISC Libyan  ] officials were to have visited [LOC France  ] in April to follow-up on the [LOC France-Libya  ] nuclear deal , but there are no indications that the project has progressed . 
End note . 
) The [ORG GOL  ] appears to be soliciting civilian nuclear cooperation from a number of different potential bilateral partners . 
[LOC LIBYA  ] INVESTING IN UKRAINE'S DOWNSTREAM OIL SECTOR ... <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) During [PER Tymoshenko  ] 's visit , the [MISC Ukrainian  ] delegation presented 17 commercial contracts for [LOC Libya  ] 's consideration and [PER Tymoshenko  ] said she expected all 17 to be finalized and signed during a putative meeting of the [ORG Ukraine-Libya Steering Committee  ] in [LOC Kiev  ] in July . 
The [MISC Ukrainian  ] Ambassador said the [MISC Ukrainian  ] summer holiday season and [LOC Libya  ] 's hosting of the upcoming [ORG African Union Summit  ] make it unlikely that the meeting would take place as scheduled . 
Casting doubt on the projects' viability , he told [PER Martynov  ] that he should add the phrase " it would be nice if .. . 
" as a prelude to the text of each proposed contract reported in the press . 
The parties held preliminary talks on establishing a [MISC Libyan  ] investment center in [LOC Ukraine  ] to oversee joint projects related to oil , gas and agriculture . 
In the energy sector , the proposed projects are for the supply of 600,000 tons of [MISC Libyan  ] oil to [LOC Ukraine  ] 's [LOC Kremenchug  ] refinery , the construction of an oil refinery in [LOC Ukraine  ] , the building of ten fuel stations , the modernization of [MISC Ukrainian  ] thermoelectric power stations , and the participation of [MISC Libyan  ] investment funds in the privatization of the [ORG Odessa Port-Side Plant.  ] .. . 
AND POSSIBLY IN WHEAT PRODUCTION TRIPOLI 00000476 002.2 OF 002 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Martynov  ] said [PER Tymoshenko  ] wanted to approve an agreement for [LOC Libya  ] to cultivate 100,000 hectares of [MISC Ukrainian  ] land for production of wheat that would be exported to [LOC Libya  ] ; however , the [MISC Ukrainian  ] Ambassador told him the proposal would likely encounter stiff opposition in the [MISC Ukrainian  ] parliament . 
Press reports quoted [MISC Ukrainian  ] officials as saying implementation of the deal could be bogged down by difficulties over land legislation and ownership . 
The government of [LOC Ukraine  ] does not own sufficiently large tracts and the private companies that own the land do not need government assistance to work with any foreign investor . 
( Note: [LOC Libya  ] imports nearly all of its food , including wheat and flour , and has recently purchased and leased tracts in [LOC sub-Saharan Africa  ] with the stated goal of securing stable supplies of food staples . 
End note ) . <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Comment: Even factoring in our [MISC Russian  ] colleagues' obvious motivations for down-playing the visit ( [PER Martynov  ] stressed that the [ORG GOL  ] had assured [LOC Russia  ] in the run-up that [LOC Libya  ] was " not siding with [LOC Ukraine  ] " ) , [PER Tymoshenko  ] 's trip appeared to have been of a piece with the many high-level visits hosted by [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
That is to say that it was long on ceremony and announcements , but short on real substance . 
While cooperation on civilian nuclear energy could be a long-term strategic move by [LOC Libya  ] to maximize revenues from oil exports by generating electricity through nuclear energy for domestic needs , it remains unclear whether any of its agreements on civilian nuclear cooperation , to include that with [LOC Ukraine  ] , will bear fruit . 
The scheme for [LOC Libya  ] to grow wheat in [LOC Ukraine  ] appears to have been ill-conceived . 
[PER Martynov  ] said the [MISC Ukrainian  ] Ambassador had been told by [MISC Libyan  ] officials that the [ORG GOL  ] was frankly skeptical about many of the proposed [MISC Libyan  ] deals in [LOC Ukraine  ] because of tension between the [MISC Ukrainian  ] Prime Minister and President and perceptions that it was not a stable investment venue .
