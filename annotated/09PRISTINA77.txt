<code><pre>Monday , 23 February 2009 , 17:24 C O N F I D E N T I A L PRISTINA 000077 SIPDIS DEPT FOR S , P , EUR ( FRIED , [ORG JONES  ] ) [ORG NSC  ] FOR [ORG HELGERSON  ] , OVP FOR BLINKEN FOR THE SECRETARY AND THE VICE-PRESIDENT FROM THE AMBASSADOR EO 12958 DECL: 02/14/2019 TAGS PREL , PGOV , [LOC UNMIK  ] , KV SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR THE VISIT OF [LOC KOSOVO  ] PRESIDENT SEJDIU AND PRIME MINISTER THACI TO [LOC WASHINGTON  ] , FEBRUARY 26 , 2008 Classified By: AMBASSADOR TINA KAIDANOW FOR REASONS 1.4 ( B ) AND ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) It has been a difficult but in many ways successful year since [LOC Kosovo  ] declared its independence on February 17 , 2008 . 
Though we spent much time planning for the possibility of large-scale population flows after the declaration and took precautions lest the independence move sparked outright conflict between [LOC Kosovo  ] and [LOC Serbia  ] , none of this has taken place . 
Instead , with our strong support and encouragement , [LOC Kosovo  ] has weathered a series of provocative and sometimes violent actions taken by [MISC Serb  ] hardliners , demonstrating through patience and restraint that it is a responsible member of the international community and an eager aspirant for eventual inclusion in [LOC Euro-Atlantic  ] institutions . 
[LOC Kosovo  ] has a modern constitution , has passed laws to protect its minorities , and is looking to build a sustainable economic base through development of its energy sector and other private investment . 
Acknowledging [MISC Kosovo’s  ] achievements , 55 of the most important countries in [LOC Europe  ] and elsewhere have recognized [LOC Kosovo  ] , though the pace of recognitions has been slowed by [MISC Serbia’s  ] unfortunate decision to refer the question of [LOC Kosovo  ] independence to the [ORG International Court of Justice  ] . 
[LOC Kosovo  ] is working to expand the group of recognizers , and would appreciate the assistance of the new [LOC U.S.  ] administration in convincing friends and allies -- particularly in the [MISC Islamic  ] world -- to come on board. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [MISC Kosovo’s  ] temperate line is in many ways due to the leadership of President [MISC Sejdiu  ] and Prime Minister [PER Thaci  ] , two men of very different backgrounds and political sentiment who chose to make common cause at a critical time for [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
The two formed a coalition government just prior to independence , an arrangement that has held steady despite historical animosities and considerable mistrust between their two parties . 
This visit and your visible endorsement of [MISC Kosovo’s  ] moderate approach will help fend off growing domestic criticism -- from dissatisfied members of the governing coalition and from the vocal opposition -- that [LOC Kosovo  ] leaders have not been assertive enough in establishing control over [MISC Kosovo’s  ] rebellious Serb-majority north or defending against [MISC Serbian  ] encroachments on [LOC Kosovo  ] sovereignty. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) And those encroachments will likely persist , even under the pro-European government of [MISC Serbian  ] President Tadic in [LOC Belgrade  ] . 
The previous [MISC Serbian  ] government under Prime Minister [PER Kostunica  ] engineered a policy of full ethnic separation in [LOC Kosovo  ] , physically intimidating local [MISC Serbs  ] into abandoning jobs in [LOC Kosovo’s  ] once multi-ethnic police force and municipal administrations . 
[LOC Serbia  ] held its own illegal municipal elections in [LOC Kosovo  ] despite warnings from the [ORG UN  ] that such a move violated [ORG UNSCR  ] 1244 and moved rapidly to emplace parallel institutions in Serb-majority areas throughout [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
[LOC Serbia  ] also backed open violence by the thuggish and criminalized [MISC Serb  ] leadership in [MISC Kosovo’s  ] north , which ordered the destruction of two northern border gates and the subsequent March 17 , 2008 attack on [ORG UN  ] and [ORG KFOR  ] peacekeepers. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) While Tadic has made significant steps on key issues of importance to the [LOC West  ] , including on [ORG ICTY  ] commitments , he has pursued a policy in [LOC Kosovo  ] not materially different from that of his predecessor . 
[LOC Serbia  ] continues to assert the authority of parallel [MISC Serb  ] municipal authorities throughout [LOC Kosovo  ] , sowing the seeds of potential conflict in areas where [MISC Serbs  ] and [MISC Albanians  ] live side by side . 
Tadic’s [LOC Serbia  ] has refused to restore customs operations at the two northern gates , resulting in a rash of smuggling and organized crime in northern [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
No local [MISC Serbs  ] have yet been permitted by [LOC Belgrade  ] to return to [LOC Kosovo  ] institutions . 
While Tadic and his foreign minister [PER Jeremic  ] ( the mastermind of Belgrade’s [LOC Kosovo  ] policy ) finally bowed to [MISC European  ] pressure to accept the deployment of an [ORG EU  ] rule of law mission ( [ORG EULEX  ] ) throughout [LOC Kosovo  ] , they have resisted engaging in discussions with [ORG EULEX  ] on the resolution of practical issues including customs and police , insisting instead that the [ORG UN  ] impose [MISC Belgrade-crafted  ] measures -- the so-called “six points” -- to effectively separate [MISC Kosovo’s  ] ethnic [MISC Serbs  ] from its majority population . 
Should these six points be implemented in the way [LOC Belgrade  ] foresees , Kosovars worry that partition could once again become a viable reality. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [LOC Kosovo  ] government remains prepared to engage in quiet diplomacy with [LOC Serbia  ] via [ORG EU  ] mediation , and has held open those positions in the police and public sector that were once occupied by local [MISC Serbs  ] in anticipation of any signal from [LOC Belgrade  ] to the [LOC Kosovo  ] [MISC Serb  ] community that they are free to resume a more collaborative approach . 
You can impress upon [MISC Sejdiu  ] and [PER Thaci  ] once again the imperative to maintain outreach to their minority communities and implement fully those obligations they undertook to the [MISC Serb  ] population under the plan developed by [ORG UN  ] Special Envoy ( and [PER Nobel  ] laureate ) [ORG Ahtisaari.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [MISC Kosovo’s  ] challenges are not limited to the political and security realm . 
Last year’s [ORG Donors Conference  ] saw over $1.5 billion pledged in support of [LOC Kosovo  ] , but the momentum of [MISC Kosovo’s  ] economic development and its attractiveness to international investors -- particularly in the energy field , where [MISC Kosovo’s  ] huge lignite deposits can be transformed over the next decade into a reliable domestic supply of electricity as well as an export commodity -- will ultimately depend not on the largesse of donors but on the government’s own credible pursuit of its economic objectives , something you can stress in your discussions with them . 
They will also need to avoid the serious pitfalls of cronyism , corruption and political patronage in public appointments ; the recent selections of solid professionals to lead their intelligence agency and the ministry of the [ORG Kosovo Security Force  ] ( the small , NATO-trained civil response force ) gives at least some cause for hope in this regard. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [MISC Sejdiu  ] and [PER Thaci  ] may reaffirm their conviction that [LOC U.S.  ] troop contributions in [LOC Kosovo  ] remain essential , particularly since [LOC U.S.  ] forces alone are trusted enough by [MISC Serbs  ] and [MISC Albanians  ] to maintain peace in one of the most volatile parts of [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
[LOC Kosovo  ] leaders will also express their belief that only the [LOC United States  ] can provide the kind of lasting leadership in [LOC Kosovo  ] and the region that is necessary for prolonged stability . 
Frankly , we agree . 
While many in the [ORG EU  ] and most notably the “Quint” countries were vigorous in supporting [MISC Kosovo’s  ] independence , the intensified problems we predict as a consequence of Belgrade’s intransigence -- especially those surrounding [MISC Kosovo’s  ] north , where [MISC Serb  ] extremists have shown their readiness for continued confrontation -- could easily lead some queasy [MISC Europeans  ] to back away from their commitments over time and settle for a partition-like outcome that has been adamantly opposed by Kosovars of all political persuasions . 
The [ORG United Nations  ] , as well , though “reconfiguring” and downsizing its presence here , has shown a negative tendency to retain certain important authorities , under pressure from [LOC Belgrade  ] and [LOC Moscow  ] . 
If [LOC Kosovo  ] is to succeed as a long-term proposition -- and it most certainly can -- our sustained engagement is necessary to bolster [MISC European  ] resolve , bring [LOC Belgrade  ] to a more realistic sense of its equities in peace and stability , and take a firm line with the [ORG UN  ] on further reducing its presence in [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
These meetings in [LOC Washington  ] will help reinforce the sense that [LOC Kosovo  ] is moving forward and imbue [MISC Kosovo’s  ] leadership with a renewed sense of confidence as they prepare to face the many challenges ahead .
