Stephen Beecroft  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) Summary: Mr. Vice President , Embassy [LOC Amman  ] warmly welcomes you to [LOC Jordan  ] . 
As you arrive , [LOC Jordan  ] continues to face some of the most troubling challenges of King [PER Abdullah  ] 's 10-year reign . 
[LOC Jordan  ] has been hit hard by the global economic slowdown and is heavily aid-dependent . 
The pared-down 2010 national budget , which still includes a [MISC USD  ] 1.43 billion deficit before grants , has imposed painful cuts across the board , including a 20 percent cut in capital expenditures . 
[LOC Jordan  ] 's domestic political scene remains unsettled , and the government is constitutionally ruling by decree following the King 's late November 2009 dissolution of parliament , a body considered by many [MISC Jordanians  ] to have been selected through government-manipulated elections . 
[PER Samir Rifai  ] , the new Prime Minister , is currently overseeing an inter-ministerial committee drafting amendments to the electoral law and has promised to unveil the amended law in May , with elections currently scheduled to take place during the last quarter of 2010. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) Regional tensions also continue to capture the attention of the [MISC Jordanian  ] leadership . 
[LOC Amman  ] is particularly focused on the perceived stalled peace negotiations between the [MISC Palestinians  ] and [MISC Israelis  ] and [LOC Iran  ] 's evolving nuclear program and growing regional influence , which [MISC Jordanian  ] officials view as distinct issues . 
The solution to both is seen as linked by [MISC Jordanian  ] interlocutors . 
At the same time , [LOC Jordan  ] has made significant contributions in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and has worked to improve regional security by encouraging [LOC Syria  ] to seek a moderate [MISC Arab  ] alternative to [MISC Iranian  ] influence and strengthening ties to [LOC Baghdad  ] . 
End Summary . 
Budget Challenges and Impact on [ORG USG  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Your visit comes as [LOC Jordan  ] faces a difficult budget environment . 
The 2010 budget includes [MISC USD  ] 6.74 billion in projected revenues and [MISC USD  ] 7.71 billion in expenditures ( 83 percent of which is accounted for by [LOC Jordan  ] 's bloated civil service and military patronage system ) and has a [MISC USD  ] 1.4 billion deficit before grants , which is 5.8 percent of [LOC Jordan  ] 's GDP ( estimated at [MISC USD  ] 24.7 billion for 2010 ) . 
The 2010 budget features 20 percent cuts to capital expenditures and 1.4 percent cuts to current expenditures and will impact [ORG GOJ  ] agencies by curtailing their ability to hire new employees and forcing additional cuts in overtime , official travel , and purchases of vehicles and furniture . 
Existing reform and development projects requiring new staff and/or construction will also face financial constraints . 
Weak growth in 2009 will translate to lower income and sales tax revenues this year ( taxes on 2009 income will be paid in 2010 ) . 
This along with a downward trend for the collection of land sale and other fees by the [ORG GOJ  ] in 2010 portends an even more precarious budget situation during the second half of 2010 . 
This budget environment has already resulted in requests from the [ORG GOJ  ] for additional [ORG USG  ] financial and technical assistance . 
Assistance [ORG MOU  ] -------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) On September 22 , 2008 , [LOC Jordan  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] signed a memorandum of understanding ( [ORG MOU  ] ) related to development , economic , and military assistance . 
The agreement laid out a five-year non-binding annual commitment of economic support funds ( [ORG ESF  ] ) [MISC USD  ] 360 million ) and foreign military funds ( [ORG FMF  ] ) [MISC USD  ] 300 million ) . 
( Note: The FY 2011 OMB budget submission includes $360 million in [ORG ESF  ] and [MISC USD  ] 300 million in [ORG FMF  ] for [LOC Jordan  ] . 
End note . 
) In turn , a side letter spelled out the joint intent to expand cooperation in the political and economic arenas . 
The side letter draws on the 2006 [MISC Jordanian  ] " [ORG National Agenda  ] " reform plan and identifies areas of mutual cooperation to be discussed in separate economic and political bilateral dialogues . 
A bilateral political dialogue meeting focused on equality for women under the law , media freedom , religious tolerance and freedom , prison conditions and inmate treatment , good governance , and a strong civil society was held in [LOC Amman  ] in January 2010 with senior [ORG State Department  ] officials . 
[ORG GOJ  ] officials have proposed that the bilateral economic dialogue take place in April in [LOC Washington  ] . 
Political Changes ----------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) The King constitutionally dissolved the Parliament in late November 2009 . 
The public supported the King 's decision because parliament was widely perceived to have been elected in manipulated elections and was seen as corrupt and ineffective . 
Cooperation between the then-cabinet and parliament had deteriorated to such an extent by late summer 2009 that only a minimal amount of legislation was offered for parliamentary consideration , most of which was stymied or , if approved , mangled in the process , according to parliamentary observers. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Following the King 's dissolution of the parliament , he exercised a constitutional clause which allowed him to extend the normal constitutionally required four-month window for new elections . 
Palace statements indicate that this was done to reform the election law , which strongly favors rural , [LOC East Bank  ] communities over urban communities with large [MISC Palestinian-origin  ] populations . 
The King has established a ministerial-level committee , overseen by Prime Minister [PER Rifai  ] , to draft electoral law reforms and announced that parliamentary elections will be held in the last quarter of <a id='par2010' href='#par2010'>¶</a>2010 . 
However , there have been no meaningful consultations with electoral reform advocates to date and few believe that the new law will produce any significant changes. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In early December , the King requested the resignation of then-Prime Minister [PER Nader Dahabi  ] and appointed to replace him [PER Samir Rifai  ] , who is a former official and advisor to the King in the [LOC Royal Court  ] , Foreign Minister [PER Nasser Judeh  ] 's cousin , and the son of former Prime Minister and [ORG Upper House  ] Speaker [PER Zayd Rifai  ] . 
In his designation letter to [PER Rifai  ] , the King emphasized , among various reform efforts , the need to fight corruption. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Along with the new Prime Minister , a new 29-member cabinet was named and officially sworn in on December 14 . 
Local commentators note a lack of new faces in the cabinet , with 13 returning ministers and seven who served in previous governments . 
Analysts believe that the government , as a whole , will ultimately turn out to be conservative rather than reform-oriented in its decision-making . 
In the absence of a sitting parliament , the new government has begun to pass so-called " temporary laws " or legislation enacted without parliamentary approval , which will theoretically be subject to parliamentary re-evaluation once new members are elected and seated . 
Some commentators see this as a way for the government to pass legislation which otherwise would not have made it through a sitting parliament . 
For example , much needed tax reform laws , which the previous parliament opposed , were recently enacted as well as a law on renewable energy . 
[LOC Middle East Peace  ] ------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) During your visit , you will hear from [ORG GOJ  ] interlocutors their concern on the lack of progress in [LOC Middle East Peace  ] negotiations . 
The King remains a resolute advocate of a two-state solution and has responded positively to his engagements with [PER SEMEP Mitchell  ] . 
[MISC Jordanian  ] officials consistently express concern that [LOC Jordan  ] will be asked to assume some form of responsibility for the [LOC West Bank  ] , a proposition that [ORG King Abdullah  ] consistently resists , as does an overwhelming percentage of the [MISC Jordanian  ] public. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [ORG King Abdullah  ] has said publicly that the lack of progress is the greatest threat to stability in the region and hurts [LOC U.S.  ] credibility in the region . 
[ORG King Abdullah  ] further asserts that the lack of meaningful progress hurts the ability of the [LOC United States  ] to advance its interests on multiple issues in the region , including on [LOC Iran  ] . 
[LOC Jordan  ] considers settlement activities , home demolitions , and evictions in [LOC Jerusalem  ] to be particularly destabilizing and unhelpful in restarting negotiations . 
The King also has a keen interest in preserving [LOC Jordan  ] 's role in administering the [MISC Haram  ] al-Sharif/Temple Mount complex in [LOC Jerusalem  ] and in overseeing other [MISC Islamic  ] and [MISC Christian  ] holy sites in [LOC Jerusalem.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) Recently , the [ORG King  ] has adopted a new approach , pressing PM [PER Netanyahu  ] and President [PER Abbas  ] to initiate immediate proximity talks as a means to work towards direct negotiations . 
Positive progress at the negotiating table , however meager , could provide crucial political cover for President [PER Abbas  ] , affording him a measure of maneuverability . 
Given his public backing of [LOC U.S.  ] efforts , the King also views the lack of progress as damaging to his own credibility and limiting his ability to play a constructive role in the future . 
[LOC Iran  ] ---- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [LOC Jordan  ] is concerned about [MISC Iranian  ] influence in the region , particularly the potentially destabilizing effect of an [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear program , support for [ORG Hizballah  ] and [ORG Hamas  ] , support for the [MISC Huthi  ] and other armed groups in [LOC Yemen  ] , and [LOC Iran  ] 's role in [LOC Iraq  ] and links with [LOC Syria  ] . 
The King believes that the recent post-election violence in [LOC Iran  ] exposes deep fissures in the [MISC Iranian  ] polity that " makes the Supreme Leader look a bit less supreme , " forcing [LOC Iran  ] 's leadership to turn inward on domestic issues and limiting their freedom and resources to act internationally . 
Especially with the recent buildup of [LOC U.S.  ] military assets in the [LOC Persian Gulf  ] , [ORG GOJ  ] contacts fear that [LOC Iran  ] will try to counter these perceptions with a dramatic act. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [ORG Jordan  ] 's senior leadership draws a direct link between the willingness of [MISC Arab  ] states to counter [LOC Iran  ] , and progress on [LOC Middle East  ] peace , saying that [MISC Israeli  ] and [MISC Sunni-Arab  ] interests are perfectly aligned with respect to [LOC Iran  ] . 
[LOC Jordan  ] will quietly support new [ORG UNSC  ] sanctions against [LOC Iran  ] , but will be loath to enforce those sanctions in the absence of progress in the [LOC Middle East  ] peace negotiations . 
Without a material improvement in the negotiations , any confrontation with [LOC Iran  ] risks backlash from regional publics and [MISC Palestinian  ] groups who cast [LOC Tehran  ] as their protector . 
Realization of the two-state solution would consolidate the regional consensus against [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Jordan  ] believes . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] ----------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [ORG Jordan  ] makes significant contributions to [LOC U.S.  ] regional security priorities . 
In July 2009 , [LOC Jordan  ] deployed a 712-soldier Ranger Battalion to [LOC Afghanistan  ] to provide election security . 
The [ORG Jordanian Armed Forces  ] ( [ORG JAF  ] ) has deployed two battalions in rotation in support of [ORG OEF  ] as of January 2010 , despite the cost ( pay entitlements ) and risk to their soldiers' safety . 
[ORG JAF  ] leaders have intimated that they would advocate even larger-scale deployments ( a brigade ) , if the pay/entitlement expense were not so burdensome . 
In fact , during the [ORG Joint Military Commission  ] in November 2009 , [PER MG Mash'al Al Zaben  ] , Chief of Staff for Strategy , stated that [LOC Jordan  ] would stay in [LOC Afghanistan  ] until the last [LOC U.S.  ] soldier came home. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Following the December 30 suicide bombing by a [MISC Jordanian  ] national in [LOC Khost  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Jordan  ] has experienced increased calls by opposition groups and non-governmental figures to explain its [LOC Afghanistan  ] assistance and end its security cooperation with the [LOC United States  ] . 
So far , such calls and commentary in the press have received no traction with the government , which has vigorously and publicly defended its efforts to combat terrorism . 
[MISC Jordanian  ] government officials have privately reiterated a commitment to maintaining their relationship with us , highlighting their deployments in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and elsewhere . 
[LOC Syria  ] ----- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [LOC Jordan  ] increased its engagement with [LOC Syria  ] in the last half of 2009 , attempting to draw [LOC Damascus  ] toward an alignment with moderate [MISC Arab  ] states and away from [MISC Iranian  ] influence . 
The [ORG King  ] and [MISC Syrian  ] President [PER Bashar Al Assad  ] met at least four times in 2009 , which resulted in agreements on a number of initiatives , including border demarcation , customs procedures , and commercial transport . 
Despite recent agreements , [MISC Jordanian  ] officials continue to be skeptical of [MISC Syrian  ] intentions to follow through . 
[LOC Iraq  ] -------------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [LOC Jordan  ] has been a leader in engaging with [LOC Iraq  ] , reaching out to promote bilateral trade and encouraging [LOC Iraq  ] to build stronger ties with [MISC Arab  ] states rather than with [LOC Iran  ] . 
The [ORG King  ] became the first [MISC Arab  ] Head of State to visit [LOC Baghdad  ] , in July 2008 , subsequently named an Ambassador to [LOC Iraq  ] , and has promised to name a [PER Defense Attach  ] . 
The [ORG King  ] supports Prime Minister [PER Maliki  ] and sees progress as slow , but moving in the right direction . 
Senior [MISC Jordanian  ] leaders have become concerned that increasing tensions between the central government and the [ORG Kurdistan Region  ] will erupt in violent conflict and are skeptical that [LOC Iraq  ] can maintain stability as [LOC U.S.  ] forces withdraw. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Jordan  ] hosts numerous [MISC Iraqi  ] " guests " who have fled the conflict and its after-effects and has provided them with access to some social services . 
The [ORG GOJ  ] does not formally classify the [MISC Iraqis  ] as refugees , because of concerns that a new permanent refugee populace in [LOC Jordan  ] , in addition to the already sizable [MISC Palestinian  ] refugee population , would further erode the demographic position of [LOC East Bankers  ] . 
The [ORG GOJ  ] emphasizes that hosting the [MISC Iraqis  ] has been a burden on the budget , and [LOC Jordan  ] has received significant amounts of international aid to ease their already tight fiscal situation . 
[MISC Jordanian  ] officials have previously placed the number of [MISC Iraqi  ] refugees between 450,000 and 500,000 , but have now backed away from specific numbers of late in the face of estimates from most international organizations and [ORG NGOs  ] that are significantly lower , perhaps in the 100,000 to 200,000 range . 
The real numbers are uncertain in the absence of a needs assessment study on [MISC Iraqis  ] in [LOC Jordan  ] , which the [LOC U.S.  ] and others have been urging . 
Displaced [MISC Iraqis  ] in [LOC Jordan  ] are integrated and live within [MISC Jordanian  ] communities , not in refugee camps .
