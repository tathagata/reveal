( S/NF ) On the same week as the successful [ORG U.S.-Russia Presidential Summit in Moscow  ] , the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Russia  ] held their sixth Experts Meeting under their bilateral Man-Portable [ORG Air Defense Systems  ] ( [ORG MANPADS  ] ) Arrangement July 9-10 in [LOC Washington  ] . 
Several items of interest were covered , including: 1. a framework for the exchange of information on domestic [ORG MANPADS  ] destruction ; 2. the risk of diversion of [ORG MANPADS  ] from [LOC Venezuela  ] to the [ORG FARC  ] ; 3. illicit [ORG MANPADS  ] proliferation from [LOC Eritrea  ] ; 4. potential cooperation on [ORG MANPADS  ] destruction projects with other states ; and 5. next steps to facilitate the transfer of Russian-made [MISC Finnish  ] [ORG MANPADS  ] to the [LOC U.S.  ] for countermeasures testing . 
The [MISC Russian  ] side again requested [LOC U.S.  ] help preventing the spread of [ORG MANPADS  ] in the [LOC Caucasus  ] , in particular information on Polish-supplied [ORG MANPADS  ] to [LOC Georgia  ] that were discovered in [LOC Chechnya  ] following the August 2008 conflict . 
In response to our non-paper on the subject , the [MISC Russian  ] MFA informed us it had begun a dialogue with the [MISC Polish  ] government . 
The next Experts Meeting was tentatively scheduled for fall 2010 in [LOC Moscow  ] , at the earliest . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] delegation was co-chaired by [PER Steven Costner  ] ( Deputy Director of [MISC PM/WRA  ] ) and [PER Anita Friedt  ] ( Director of [MISC EUR/PRA  ] ) . 
The [MISC Russian  ] delegation was chaired by Col. [PER Oleg Skabara  ] from the [ORG MOD  ] . 
See para 31 for a full delegation list . 
End Summary . 
Information Exchanges <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) Both sides provided the details of their quarterly [ORG MANPADS  ] transfers . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] submitted its first quarter report , which reported no transfers from January 1-March 31 , prior to the meeting . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] provided its second quarter report ( due by September 30 ) , which covered April 1 through June 30 , during the meeting , which also reported no transfers . 
The [MISC Russians  ] provided their first quarter exchange prior to the meeting , which reported the transfer of 100 IGLA-S missiles and 90 associated gripstocks to [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
( see below para for more details on the [LOC Venezuela  ] discussion ) . 
Destruction Information Exchange <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) The [LOC U.S.  ] side raised the issue of the exchange of information on the destruction of obsolete [ORG MANPADS  ] , referencing the [LOC U.S.  ] non-paper which detailed our proposal for the exchange that was provided to the [ORG GOR  ] in advance of the meeting . 
The [MISC Russian  ] delegation acknowledged receiving the [LOC U.S.  ] non-paper and expressed gratitude for starting a dialogue on this topic . 
The sides agreed in principle that the exchange should take place on an annual basis , that both sides would consider reporting information starting with 2005 , and that information on the quantity and type of missiles and gripstocks destroyed should be included . 
The sides also agreed that the quantities - but not types - of batteries should be reported in this exchange. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) The [MISC Russian  ] delegation expressed a willingness to discuss the issue further , but insisted that they needed more time to clear the [LOC U.S.  ] proposal with other executive agencies within the [MISC Russian  ] government . 
The [MISC Russians  ] recognized the [LOC U.S.  ] has taken serious steps on this issue and suggested that the sides continue this dialogue through diplomatic channels . 
[LOC Venezuela  ] [ORG MANPADS  ] transfers <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) In response to the [LOC U.S.  ] paper outlining [LOC U.S.  ] concerns about the possibility of diversion to non state actors of IGLA-S systems being delivered to the Government of [LOC Venezuela  ] ( [ORG GOV  ] ) , the [MISC Russian  ] delegation stated that they understood the concerns raised at high levels between our Secretary of State and the [MISC Russian  ] Minister of [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] as well as between [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador Kislyak and [ORG WHA A/S Shannon  ] . 
[PER Skabara  ] assured the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation that [MISC Russian  ] law provides specific measures to prevent illegal transfers to third parties . 
He then stated that the issues raised in the paper were reflected in end user checks as well as in the contract between the [ORG GOR  ] and [ORG GOV  ] , and that the [ORG GOR  ] has required an end-user regime that guarantees that transfers to third parties will not take place . 
[PER Skabara  ] said that the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation had seen how well the [MISC Russians  ] secure their stockpiles and assured the [LOC U.S.  ] that these same controls were written into the contract with [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
Along with this , the [ORG GOR  ] has had dialogue with the [ORG GOV  ] evaluating the [ORG GOV  ] 's physical security of the systems , which specifically featured a discussion about the [ORG FARC  ] . 
[ORG GOR  ] assured the [LOC U.S.  ] side that transfers from [LOC Venezuela  ] to the [ORG FARC  ] cannot take place. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) Questions and comparisons were raised by the [LOC U.S.  ] side about [MISC Russian  ] ammunition , sold to [LOC Venezuela  ] , and found in possession of the [ORG FARC  ] . 
[PER Skabara  ] first suggested that the ammunition did not come from [LOC Russia  ] , but was probably a sale from " unlicensed production " a suggestion that it was manufactured in a third country without appropriate permits from [LOC Russia  ] . 
When the [LOC U.S.  ] side pointed out that the ammunition carried factory stamps , and that we provided this information , the [MISC Russians  ] responded that the meeting was to discuss [ORG MANPADS  ] , not ammunition , and that these are different weapons and the approach , scale , and control applied to them are different . 
He said the [LOC U.S.  ] did not provide enough information to the [MISC Russians  ] on the confiscated ammunition for them to fully investigate the discovery ; however [LOC Russia  ] is carrying out an investigation . 
He added that it would be " impossible " for a similar scenario to take place with [ORG MANPADS  ] , as they have an ongoing dialogue with [LOC Venezuela  ] that allows them to evaluate the security and use of these [ORG MANPADS  ] , and thus none of these [ORG MANPADS  ] can be transferred to the [LOC FARC.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) [PER Giovanni Snidle  ] from [LOC WHA/FO  ] said that he was pleased to be able to report to Ambassador [ORG Shannon  ] that an investigation is ongoing into the [MISC Russian  ] cartridges found with the [ORG FARC  ] and that the [LOC U.S.  ] would appreciate if the [MISC Russians  ] shared the findings . 
[PER Snidle  ] expressed that the concerns were not [MISC Venezuela-specific  ] , but a concern with the [ORG Western Hemisphere  ] as a whole , noting that when new [ORG MANPADS  ] were provided to the [MISC Venezuelans  ] , it was possible that the older , excess [ORG MANPADS  ] could be transferred to others in the region . 
He asked the [MISC Russians  ] to consider the following parameters ( also outlined in a non-paper provided in advance of the meeting ) when signing [ORG MANPADS  ] contracts with western hemisphere countries: --Vehicle-mounted variants as opposed to shoulder-fired. --Limited numbers. --One-for-one replacement of old/outdated MANPADS. --Destruction of old stockpiles . 
He stated that he was pleased to hear of the level of accountability and encouraged them to continue end-use assurances in future transfers . 
The [MISC Russians  ] noted that [LOC Venezuela  ] didn't want vehicle mounted systems , it only requested shoulder-fired systems , and that the two systems are not interchangeable . 
[PER Skabara  ] agreed to take the suggestions on one-for-one replacement and stockpile destruction back to [LOC Moscow  ] for consideration. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) ISN 's [PER Ann Ganzer  ] asked about the " surprise inspections , " mentioned to Secretary [PER Clinton  ] by Minister [PER Lavrov  ] . 
[PER Skabara  ] stated that these were not exactly surprise inspections . 
He explained that an inspection would be triggered if the [ORG GOR  ] believed the contract had been violated or had information that indicated an inspection was necessary . 
( Comment: This is consistent with what the [MISC Russians  ] have told us in previous [ORG MANPADS  ] meetings . 
End Comment ) He added that , to date , no inspections have been conducted and that no future inspections are scheduled . 
He did not consider the ammunition transferred to the [ORG FARC  ] to be an indication that an inspection was warranted , as ammunition is not the same as [ORG MANPADS  ] . 
He assured the [LOC U.S.  ] side that the contract endowed the [ORG GOR  ] with the right to perform a spontaneous inspection at any time . 
[PER Costner  ] noted that , if fully implemented , the surprise inspections would lessen the likelihood of a diversion and urged the [ORG GOR  ] to perform these inspections regardless of the presence of a " triggering event . 
" <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) [PER Skabara  ] was receptive to [LOC U.S.  ] inquiries on the exchange and its end-user controls and stated that if provided with specific questions , through diplomatic channels , they will be able to respond . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] pointed out that it had already provided detailed questions in the non-paper , passed to the [ORG GOR  ] in advance of the meeting , and that a written response to these inquiries would be appreciated . 
[PER Skabara  ] said that there had not been enough time to prepare a response to the paper , but that the answers could be provided in written form once they get back to [LOC Moscow  ] . 
He sought a [LOC U.S.  ] briefing on end-user controls in response . 
[PER Skabara  ] said that every state has a right to self defense under the [ORG United Nations Charter  ] ; however , the [ORG GOR  ] is aware of the strategic , practical , and technical norms . 
He added that there is a line that should not be crossed , but that the [ORG MANPADS  ] provided to [LOC Venezuela  ] would not destabilize the region . 
He finished by stating that he could not get into details about any future shipments and highlighted that [LOC Russia  ] is willing to engage in an open dialogue on this issue . 
[PER Horn  ] Of [LOC Africa/Eritrea  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) The [LOC U.S.  ] delegation then raised the issue of Russian-made [MISC Eritrean  ] [ORG MANPADS  ] discovered in [LOC Somalia  ] which was discussed at the Experts Meeting in 2008 ( ref F ) . 
The [MISC Russian  ] delegation confirmed that the [ORG MFA  ] raised this issue with the Government of [LOC Eritrea  ] ( [ORG GOE  ] ) , and had not revealed the [LOC U.S.  ] as the source of the allegation . 
According to the [MISC Russian  ] [ORG MFA  ] representative the [ORG GOE  ] denied that the transfer took place , accusing " enemies , " namely [LOC Ethiopia  ] , of fabricating the accusation . 
The [ORG GOE  ] demanded further information on the transfer including the source and other supporting information ( i.e. photographs ) . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] delegation offered to discuss the question of photographs with relevant [LOC U.S.  ] agencies and report back to the [ORG GOR  ] through diplomatic channels . 
The [MISC Russian  ] side then stated that its relationship with [LOC Eritrea  ] is not strong , thus [LOC Russia  ] cannot guarantee any further useful information on this issue. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S ) The [LOC U.S.  ] delegation then reiterated a request from the 2008 Meeting for a detailed list of all [MISC Soviet  ] and [MISC Russian  ] [ORG MANPADS  ] transfers to [LOC Eritrea  ] and the [ORG HOA  ] in general . 
The [MISC Russian  ] delegation responded that this was impossible , as all records of [ORG MANPADS  ] transfers prior to the year 2000 were destroyed in accordance with [MISC Russian  ] laws governing classified information . 
Further questioning by the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation on this issue raised a series of translation problems . 
The [MISC Russian  ] side did not understand requests from the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation for " records " of these transfers . 
The [MISC Russian  ] delegation stated that records of [ORG MANPADS  ] transfers ( but not serial numbers ) after 2000 ( possibly from 2003 ) may be available and offered to investigate the issue and report back via diplomatic channels . 
The [MISC Russians  ] asked for a formal , written request on this issue . 
( Comment: Misunderstandings related to translation errors during this discussion may warrant a follow up with the [ORG GOR  ] to confirm [PER Skabara  ] 's statements . 
End Comment . 
) [LOC Georgia  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( S ) The [MISC Russian  ] delegation then raised the question of [MISC Georgian  ] [ORG MANPADS  ] proliferation . 
[PER Skabara  ] first outlined the [ORG GOR  ] 's concerns about the build-up of weapons in [LOC Georgia  ] and potential " [MISC Georgian  ] aggression " in the [LOC Caucasus  ] . 
[PER Skabara  ] continued by invoking [ORG Section  ] 5 of the Bilateral Arrangement where [LOC Russia  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] are bound to the obligation of preventing the transfer of [MISC Polish  ] [ORG MANPADS  ] to [LOC Georgia  ] . 
The [MISC Russian  ] delegation acknowledged receipt of our non-paper in response to [LOC Russia  ] 's concerns and confirmed that the [MISC Russian  ] [ORG MFA  ] had begun a dialogue with the [MISC Polish  ] government on this issue. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( S ) [PER Costner  ] acknowledged the mutual interests the [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Russian  ] sides have , and the connection that exists between stemming [ORG MANPADS  ] proliferation in [LOC Venezuela/Horn  ] of [LOC Africa  ] and the [LOC Caucasus  ] , respectively . 
He noted the [LOC U.S.  ] has raised concerns with the [MISC Georgian  ] government on stockpile security and controls of excess munitions . 
He emphasized that the key difference lies in the fact that the [LOC U.S.  ] has never transferred [ORG MANPADS  ] to [LOC Georgia.  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( S ) Following [PER Costner  ] 's remarks , [ORG EUR/PRA Office Director  ] [PER Anita Friedt  ] added that the [LOC U.S.  ] deeply regrets the loss of life on both the [MISC Georgian  ] and [MISC Russian  ] sides resulting from the August conflict . 
She underscored that the [LOC U.S.  ] has not transferred [ORG MANPADS  ] systems to [LOC Georgia  ] and affirmed the USG policy of non-lethal weapon assistance to [LOC Georgia  ] . 
She said the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Georgia  ] had a strong nonproliferation partnership and expressed appreciation for [MISC Russian  ] efforts to reach out to [LOC Poland  ] on this issue . 
The [MISC Russian  ] delegation reiterated its concerns on this issue , the importance of not blaming each other by continuing this dialogue , and requested that the [LOC U.S  ] continue to work with both [LOC Georgia  ] and [LOC Poland.  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( S ) [PER Skabara  ] thanked the [LOC U.S.  ] side for working with [LOC Poland  ] and [LOC Georgia  ] on this issue and stated that the [ORG GOR  ] has had a pragmatic and active dialogue with [LOC Poland  ] and hopes that in the future this dialogue will generate specific results on this question . 
[LOC Russia  ] would continue to share the outcome of this dialogue with the [LOC U.S.  ] in the future . 
[ORG Black Markets in Latin America <a  ] id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The [LOC U.S.  ] side then gave a briefing on the [ORG MANPADS  ] black market in [LOC Latin America  ] . 
The [ORG MANPADS  ] black market in the region is small , the number of potential users is low , and prices are high compared to other regions such as the [LOC Middle East  ] , [LOC South Asia  ] , and [LOC Africa  ] . 
Central [MISC American  ] countries historically have posed the largest proliferation risk because of the availability of systems unrecovered after civil conflicts in the 1980s . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] side stated concerns about the [ORG FARC  ] 's apparent desire to obtain [ORG MANPADS  ] , but said that the likelihood that they have already is very low . 
Specific instances where there would be heightened risk of proliferation could include when [ORG MANPADS  ] are deployed to forward operating bases ( as in the case of [LOC Venezuela  ] ) . 
[ORG MANPADS  ] are generally secure when they are in central stockpiles ; however , when they are deployed they may be lost in combat , corruption , or to the black market . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] side reiterated that any proliferation to the [ORG FARC  ] is important and is likely to lead to a significant increase in the air defense threat to [MISC Colombian  ] and [LOC US  ] aircraft operating in the region. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The [LOC U.S.  ] briefing laid out possible steps to limiting illicit proliferation of [ORG MANPADS  ] , including: inventory of existing stockpiles , avoidance of destabilizing-sized sales , destruction of old stockpiles , and limitations to the portability of systems . 
This complemented directly the [LOC U.S.  ] requests for curbing the threat posed by sales to [LOC Venezuela  ] , including offering vehicle- or pedestal- mounted variants rather than shoulder-fired systems. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( S/REL [LOC RUSSIA  ] ) The [MISC Russian  ] side responded positively to the brief and asked if the [LOC U.S.  ] exports [ORG MANPADS  ] to [LOC South America  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] side responded that the [LOC U.S.  ] exports very few [ORG MANPADS  ] anywhere and since at least 2005 ( i.e. , when the Arrangement was signed and quarterly transfer exchanges began ) there has not been a single [ORG MANPADS  ] transferred to [LOC South America  ] . 
There are no STINGER [ORG MANPADS  ] in [LOC South America  ] and that obsolete , [LOC U.S.  ] REDEYE [ORG MANPADS  ] would have been pulled out years ago . 
[ORG Regional Cooperation Efforts  ] <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( S ) [PER Snidle  ] then gave a brief presentation on [LOC U.S.  ] efforts with the [ORG OAS  ] to provide for the security of [ORG MANPADS  ] in [LOC Latin America  ] . 
[PER Snidle  ] explained that the [ORG International Civil Aviation Organization  ] ( [ORG ICAO  ] ) had urged the region in 2004 to take concrete steps to protect themselves against [ORG MANPADS  ] threats . 
The [ORG OAS  ] states have since signed Resolution 2145 which urged them to adopt strict national [ORG MANPADS  ] controls , ban transfers to non-state actors , destroy excess and unsecured weapons , and recommended physical security and stockpile management guidelines . 
The [ORG OAS  ] produced a set of [ORG MANPADS  ] regulations , originally written in four languages , to adhere to the resolution . 
[PER Snidle  ] urged the [MISC Russians  ] to adhere to these guidelines when selling/transferring [ORG MANPADS  ] to the region. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( S ) For the final item of the first day , the [MISC Russian  ] delegation responded by outlining its cooperation with [LOC CIS  ] member states . 
According to the [MISC Russian  ] delegation , the [ORG GOR  ] has recently concluded frameworks for information exchange on [ORG MANPADS  ] stockpile security measures in [LOC Uzbekistan  ] and [LOC Ukraine  ] , and is working to establish similar agreements in [LOC Moldova  ] and [LOC Azerbaijan  ] . 
The agreement with the [MISC Uzbeks  ] has entered into force ; the agreement with the [MISC Ukrainians  ] was signed in May 2009 and is expected to enter into force this year . 
The [ORG GOR  ] sought a similar arrangement with [LOC Georgia  ] , but has not received a [MISC Georgian  ] reply on this question since April 2008. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( SBU ) On the second day of talks , [PER Louis Ganem  ] from [ORG ISN/CATR  ] briefed on regional security seminars hosted by the [LOC U.S.  ] for several regional partners . 
He provided information on how the [LOC United States  ] coordinates and implements multinational conferences and seminars on small arms and light weapons , with a focus on [ORG MANPADS  ] proliferation . 
[PER Ganem  ] explained that the seminars are designed to identify regional threats , common security goals , exchange information on security programs and training , identify requirements , and provide program assistance . 
He added that regional partners , sharing the same security goals , are invited to discuss how to improve existing and implement new regional security capabilities . 
The focus of such seminars is on identifying preventive security measures , such as export controls and border security programs and training to eliminate the risks of illicit proliferation . 
The intent is to improve regional security capabilities by promoting partnership and cooperation among partner nations . 
[PER Ganem  ] concluded contemplating the possibility of future events in [LOC South  ] and [LOC Central Asia  ] and [LOC Latin America  ] , and asked the [MISC Russians  ] to consider participation. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [MISC Russian  ] delegation responded to this presentation positively , stating that they had sent representatives , including [ORG Col. Kuts  ] , to similar multilateral seminars in the [ORG CIS  ] region . 
The [MISC Russians  ] also agreed in principle that the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [ORG GOR  ] could potentially collaborate on future regional seminars . 
[PER Skabara  ] invited the [LOC U.S.  ] to send proposals for future [ORG MANPADS  ] seminars or similar events to the [ORG GOR  ] for consideration . 
[ORG Destruction Cooperation  ] <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( S ) [PER Costner  ] then provided an update about [LOC U.S.  ] destruction cooperation efforts with other states . 
Since 2003 , the [LOC U.S.  ] has helped destroy over 30,000 [ORG MANPADS  ] missiles in 27 states , with approximately 4,000 destroyed since the last update provided at the 2008 meeting . 
The [MISC Russian  ] delegation praised these efforts , and proposed that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia  ] collaborate on joint destruction projects in the future under the auspices of the Arrangement . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] agreed that such efforts would be worthwhile , and expressed a willingness to look for opportunities for collaboration . 
FINNPADS <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [LOC U.S.  ] delegation then followed-up with the [MISC Russian  ] delegation about the transfer of Russian-made [MISC Finnish  ] [ORG MANPADS  ] to the [LOC U.S.  ] for countermeasures testing . 
The [MISC Russian  ] delegation stated that the [ORG GOR  ] would agree to the transfer under two conditions: 1. that [MISC Russian  ] experts be present for the tests , and 2. that the results of the tests be shared in writing with the [ORG GOR  ] . 
This offer , and its decision to allow the transfer , had not yet been presented to the [MISC Finnish  ] Government , as it represents a change in [MISC Russian  ] policy on this question . 
[PER Skabara  ] highlighted the fact that the " new relationship " between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia  ] had inspired this change in policy . 
The [MISC Russian  ] delegation was unable to provide further detail about the specifics of this proposal , such as how many [MISC Russian  ] visits would be required or how thorough the report to the [ORG GOR  ] would need to be . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] requested that the [ORG GOR  ] formally submit its decision , including its two conditions in writing . 
Both sides agreed to discuss further the details of the conditions and then inform the [MISC Finnish  ] Government about the decision . 
( Comment: The [MISC Finns  ] have almost 2,000 [MISC SA-16s  ] and SA-18s to dispose of because of shelf life issues . 
This dialogue has been going on sporadically for almost two years ; the first [MISC Russian  ] response cited almost the same conditions as [PER Skabara  ] presented on July 10 . 
End Comment . 
) [ORG VERBA  ] [ORG MANPADS  ] <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [LOC U.S.  ] side provided the [MISC Russians  ] with an open-source ( 2007 ) article that described a new [MISC Russian  ] [ORG MANPADS  ] system called the [ORG VERBA  ] . 
[PER Costner  ] read key passages in the article to the [MISC Russian  ] side , pointing out that the article suggests the [ORG VERBA  ] would enter into service in 2008 . 
The article also states that the [ORG VERBA  ] will replace the [ORG STRELA  ] and [ORG IGLA  ] family of systems and have a payload twenty percent larger than either of its predecessors . 
[PER Costner  ] asked the [MISC Russian  ] delegation to provide additional information on the [ORG VERBA  ] , including if it was operational , and if it would be marketed. <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [MISC Russian  ] side responded that they had no further information . 
[PER Skabara  ] questioned the legitimacy of the article saying that scientists can " write whatever they want " and stated that there was no official position on the system . 
[PER Skabara  ] stated that if the [LOC U.S.  ] wanted more information on this system , it would have to forward a written request through diplomatic channels with its questions . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] agreed to do this . 
[ORG Legislative  ] updates <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Neither side had anything to report . 
[PER Skabara  ] stated that the [ORG GOR  ] is on track to implement all of its legal mechanisms and before it develops new ones , wants to make sure they implement those they have . 
Conclusion <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Costner  ] summarized the meeting and noted the following action items and " due-outs " by both sides ahead of the next meeting: [LOC U.S.  ] side: <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
On [LOC Eritrea/Somalia  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] will seek authorization to release photographic evidence of [MISC Russian  ] [ORG MANPADS  ] diversion to [LOC Somalia  ] for the purpose of [LOC Russia  ] following up with the [MISC Eritrean  ] government. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
On [LOC Finland  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] will respond to [LOC Russia  ] 's conditions on participating in [ORG MANPADS  ] destruction and countermeasure testing. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] will follow up on the open source article handed over and produce an official request for information regarding the [ORG VERBA  ] [ORG MANPADS  ] system .

( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Both sides agreed the July 9-10 meeting was a success ; the tone of the meeting was more positive than in previous years , consistent with the " reset " of [MISC U.S.-Russia  ] relations . 
Two potentially unsettling differences from years past was the reduced size of the [MISC Russian  ] delegation ( only 2 from MOD , 1 from [ORG MFA  ] ) and a desire on the [MISC Russian  ] side to extend the time before the next meeting to eighteen months or even two years . 
Both sides have settled on the routine and relatively less controversial elements of the Arrangement ( such as information exchanges ) , but challenges remain on transparency over the more controversial issues we discussed , such as on [LOC Venezuela.  ] <a id='par30' href='#par30'>¶</a>30 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Comment continued: Both sides recognized the utility of holding a continuous dialogue on [ORG MANPADS  ] issues through diplomatic channels and along the sidelines of other [MISC SA/LW  ] meetings , such as the [ORG UN Biennial Meetings of States  ] on [MISC SA/LW  ] in [LOC New York  ] in June of 2010 . 
The [ORG Counter Terrorism Working Group  ] ( [ORG CTWG  ] ) would also present another opportunity for follow-up . 
Additionally , both sides indicated a willingness to deepen cooperation on [ORG MANPADS  ] issues to include potential joint destruction programs , regional seminars , and other bilateral efforts . 
These more robust programs would likely increase the utility of the Arrangement , as the sides broaden their [ORG MANPADS  ] cooperation beyond the scope of info exchanges and an annual meeting . 
Yet , as [PER Costner  ] summed up in response to the [MISC Russian  ] proposal to hold these meetings less frequently , it is much harder to play a game of chess by mail than in person .
