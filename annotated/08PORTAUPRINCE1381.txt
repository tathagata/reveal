Sanderson  ] . 
[MISC Reason: E.O.  ] 12958 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) This report responds to recommendation number 2 of the Embassy [MISC Port  ] au Prince OIG inspection report . 
Summary -------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The [ORG UN Stabilization Mission  ] in [LOC Haiti  ] is an indispensable tool in realizing core [ORG USG  ] policy interests in [LOC Haiti  ] . 
Security vulnerabilities and fundamental institutional weaknesses mean that [LOC Haiti  ] will require a continuing - albeit eventually shrinking - [ORG MINUSTAH  ] presence for at least three and more likely five years . 
[LOC Haiti  ] needs the [ORG UN  ] presence to fill the security gap caused by [LOC Haiti  ] 's fledgling police force 's lack of numbers and capabilities . 
It needs [ORG MINUSTAH  ] to partner with the [ORG USG  ] and other donors in institution-building . 
A premature departure of [ORG MINUSTAH  ] would leave the Preval government or his successor vulnerable to resurgent kidnapping and international drug trafficking , revived gangs , greater political violence , an exodus of seaborne migrants , a sharp drop in foreign and domestic investment , and resurgent populist and anti-market economy political forces - reversing gains of the last two years. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Summary Continued: [ORG MINUSTAH  ] is a remarkable product and symbol of hemispheric cooperation in a country with little going for it . 
There is no feasible substitute for this [ORG UN  ] presence . 
It is a financial and regional security bargain for the [ORG USG  ] . 
[ORG USG  ] civilian and military assistance under current domestic and international conditions , alone or in combination with our closest partners , could never fill the gap left by a premature [ORG MINUSTAH  ] pullout . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] will reap benefits from this hemispheric security cooperation for years to come - but only if its success is not endangered by early withdrawal . 
We must work to preserve [ORG MINUSTAH  ] by continuing to partner with it at all levels in coordination with other major donor and [ORG MINUSTAH  ] contributor countries from the hemisphere . 
That partnering will also help counter perceptions in [LOC Latin  ] contributing countries that [MISC Haitians  ] see their presence in [LOC Haiti  ] as unwanted . 
The [ORG Department and Embassies in Latin  ] countries contributing troops should work to ensure th ese countries' continuing support for [ORG MINUSTAH  ] . 
End summary . 
[LOC Haiti  ] Needs [ORG MINUSTAH  ] to Become Viable State ------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The fundamental [ORG USG  ] policy goal in [LOC Haiti  ] is to make it a viable state that does not post a threat to the region through domestic political turmoil or an exodus of illegal migrants . 
To reach that point , [LOC Haiti  ] must be able to assure its own domestic security , govern itself with stable democratic institutions , and create a business climate that will get the economy moving . 
[LOC Haiti  ] has made progress but is still a long way from these goals . 
The [ORG United Nations Stabilization Mission  ] in [LOC Haiti  ] ( [ORG MINUSTAH  ] ) is the largest and most effective external institution pursuing them . 
[LOC Haiti  ] 's progress toward viability hinges on a large international security presence and continued injections of assistance to consolidate its institutions and ease human misery . 
[ORG MINUSTAH  ] is the implementing instrument of the security goal , and [ORG MINUSTAH  ] elements are key players in the goal of consolidating institutions and providing critical disaster relief . 
[ORG MINUSTAH  ] a Security Linchpin ---------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG MINUSTAH  ] 's core stabilization function is security: filling the gap left by inadequate force levels and capabilities of the [MISC Haitian  ] [ORG National Police  ] ( [ORG HNP  ] ) . 
The [ORG HNP  ] currently has approximately 9,000 officers . 
[ORG MINUSTAH  ] in 2006 set a five-year target of training and fielding 14,000 officers - although the police reform report to the [ORG UN Security Council  ] says 20,000 are needed to adequately police the country . 
At current training and vetting rates , [LOC Haiti  ] PORT AU PR 00001381 002.2 OF 004 will reach this goal by 2012 at the earliest , provided the GOH is willing to fund and staff this level . 
( Note: This projection rests on [ORG HNP  ] plans to expand the capacity of the Police Academy beginning with the summer class of 2008 . 
End note . 
) This gain in force will be reduced if the [ORG HNP  ] acts on the results of the ongoing [ORG UN  ] vetting process and weeds out officers found to be linked to crime , corruption , and other misconduct . 
Normal attrition will also push the 2012 target date further out . 
Deficient capabilities - in experience , investigative skills , and management , all exacerbated by corruption -- limit the [ORG HNP  ] 's security clout. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Given [ORG HNP  ] 's lack of capability , [ORG MINUSTAH  ] 's backup security and police training functions are needed to fill the resulting gap in security . 
[ORG MINUSTAH  ] troops continue to provide security in areas such as the [ORG Cite Soleil  ] slum , liberated from overt gang rule in early 2007 . 
They are also the country 's ultimate riot control force which in times of unrest protects strategic government installations , including the [ORG National Palace  ] and the airport . 
In [ORG MINUSTAH  ] 's [ORG UN  ] police operations pillar , Formed Police Units ( [ORG FPU  ] - gendarmerie-type police units from individual contributor countries ) aid the [ORG HNP  ] with security operations , such as helping put down the mutiny at the national penitentiary last November , and performing riot control during the April disturbances . 
[ORG UNPOL  ] officers provide support to [ORG HNP  ] operations , down to helping the anti-kidnapping unit and beginning to assist the [ORG HNP  ] 's counter narcotics unit . 
The [ORG UNPOL  ] development pillar works with the [ORG HNP  ] to develop its capabilities . 
[ORG UNPOL  ] officers guide and monitor the training of the [ORG HNP  ] at the Police Academy and in the field . 
The [ORG MINUSTAH  ] apparatus is also conducting the vetting of the entire [ORG HNP  ] , an essential aspect of [ORG HNP  ] reform. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The April food riots threw into stark relief [ORG MINUSTAH  ] 's role as a security force of last resort . 
[MISC MIUSTAH  ] troops , [ORG FPU  ] 's and [ORG UNPOL  ] provided the criticl extra security capability that prevented riotes from overrunning the [ORG Presidential Palace  ] and pobably chasing President Preval from office . 
[ORG INUSTAH Role  ] in [LOC Institution Building  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG MINUSTAH  ] contibutes to building up [LOC Haiti  ] 's political and judiial institutions and supporting them day-to-day n the ground . 
It has a civilian presence througout the country: its civil affairs division has tams of advisers deployed in larger towns in all tn departments . 
These units advise and train oficials at a level of government that is just getting off the ground . 
At the national level , [ORG MINUSTAH  ] is a key partner of the [LOC U.S.  ] and other donor countries in building up and reforming [LOC Haiti  ] 's judicial system . 
The dimensions of the [ORG UN  ] 's civilian technical assistance and training for [LOC Haiti  ] 's national and local institutions exceed that of all other diplomatic missions in [LOC Haiti  ] put together . 
[ORG MINUSTAH Post-Hurricane Role  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The [MISC August-September  ] series of hurricanes and floods have put [ORG MINUSTAH  ] 's disaster relief role in the spotlight . 
Cut roads and fallen bridges meant that Prime Minister [PER Michele Pierre-Louis'  ] visits to flooded regions were possible only in [ORG MINUSTAH  ] helicopters . 
Their rotary wing aircraft have also flown emergency aid to areas cut off from ground transport , supplementing the air assets of the [PER USS Kearsarge  ] and the [ORG World Food Program  ] . 
[ORG MINUSTAH  ] troops rescued flood victims trapped in their homes , and continue to provide security for food convoys and distribution points , assuring that emergency aid commodities reach their destination and are distributed in an orderly manner . 
[ORG MINUSTAH  ] serves as the coordinating body among donors and between donors and the Government of [LOC Haiti  ] . 
[ORG Bottom Line  ] on Continuing [ORG MINUSTAH  ] Presence ------------------------------------------- PORT AU PR 00001381 003.2 OF 004 <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The [LOC U.S.  ] has a strong interest in maintaining [ORG MINUSTAH  ] 's presence in [LOC Haiti  ] until [LOC Haiti  ] 's security , judicial and political institutions are can maintain a minimal level of domestic security and political stability on their own . 
Embassy therefore believes that [ORG MINUSTAH  ] 's presence here is needed until the [ORG HNP  ] reaches at least 14,000 officers and [LOC Haiti  ] has installed a new President after the 2011 Presidential transition . 
A [ORG UN  ] civilian advisory presence will be needed for an additional period after the [ORG MINUSTAH  ] military and police are drawn down to help along [LOC Haiti  ] 's institution-building . 
[ORG MINUSTAH  ] already envisions gradually transitioning the current force structure from predominantly infantry to more military police and engineering units , provided the [ORG UNSC  ] agrees . 
It will reduce its civilian presence as [LOC Haiti  ] 's institutions become more solid . 
However , a significant withdrawal of the [ORG MINUSTAH  ] security forces and civilian advisers is not advisable for a minimum of three years , and we believe that a fu ll withdrawal of [ORG MINUSTAH  ] should not be considered before five years . 
Scenario of a Premature [ORG MINUSTAH  ] Departure ------------------------------------------ <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) A precipitous withdrawal of or premature drawdown of [ORG MINUSTAH  ] 's security component could open the door to elements that threaten [LOC Haiti  ] 's political stability and the consolidation of its democratic institutions . 
These are goals which we and our hemispheric and [MISC European  ] allies since 2004 have devoted over two billion USD in resources to achieve . 
Increased security and other assistance from the [LOC U.S.  ] and other large donors individually could not immediately make up for the loss of [ORG MINUSTAH  ] boots on the ground. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) We could see a rollback of stabilization and security gains made since [ORG MINUSTAH  ] began to serious confront security problems in 2006 . 
Kidnappings , now reduced through effective police work , might spike upward again . 
Drug trafficking networks , a large threat even with the current [ORG MINUSTAH  ] presence , could ramp up shipments through [LOC Haiti  ] and further their penetration of police , the judiciary , parliament -- where we estimate perhaps a score of deputies and senators are linked to the drug trade . 
Gang structures , weakened but not eliminated from [LOC Port-au-Prince  ] , [ORG Cap Haitien  ] and [LOC Gonaives  ] , could flex their muscles again . 
If gangs resurface , we could see the revival of politically-linked armed groups that during the [PER Aristide  ] era engaged in targeted violence including murder against regime critics . 
If these factors produced greater general instability , larger numbers of [MISC Haitians  ] would likely to take to the boats and attempt to reach the [LOC U.S.  ] , as they did in the unstable 1990s . 
An upward trend of the above factors would cause a deterioration of the economic environment and a drop in domestic and foreign investment . 
[ORG MINUSTAH  ] a Good Deal for the [LOC U.S.  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [ORG MINUSTAH  ] 's presence produces real regional security dividends for the [LOC U.S.  ] Paying one-quarter of [ORG MINUSTAH  ] 's budget through our DPKO assessment , the [LOC U.S.  ] reaps the security and stabilization benefits of a 9,000-person international military and civilian stabilization mission in the hemisphere 's most troubled country . 
The security dividend the [LOC U.S.  ] reaps from this hemispheric cooperation not only benefits the immediate [LOC Caribbean  ] , but also is developing habits of security cooperation in the hemisphere that will serve our interests for years to come . 
In the current context of our military commitments elsewhere , the [LOC U.S.  ] alone could not replace this mission . 
This regionally-coordinated [MISC Latin American  ] commitment to [LOC Haiti  ] would not be possible without the [ORG UN  ] umbrella . 
That same umbrella helps other major donors -- led by [LOC Canada  ] and followed up by the [ORG EU  ] , [LOC France  ] , [LOC Spain  ] , [LOC Japan  ] and others -- justify their bilateral assistance domestically . 
Without a [MISC UN-sanctioned  ] peacekeeping and stabilization force , we PORT AU PR 00001381 004 OF 004 would be getting far less help from our hemispheric and [MISC European  ] partners in managing [LOC Haiti  ] . 
But We Must Short Up Support ---------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) The [LOC U.S.  ] will continue to reap these security benefits only if [ORG MINUSTAH  ] 's mission succeeds and enables [LOC Haiti  ] to carry itself as a country . 
The [ORG USG  ] thus has a strong interest that contributing countries continue their commitment until [LOC Haiti  ] 's stability is self-sustained . 
The [ORG USG  ] should work to shore up support for [ORG MINUSTAH  ] in [LOC Haiti  ] and in hemispheric troop-contributing countries . 
We should take emphasize in [ORG UN  ] venues and bilaterally to our [MISC Latin  ] partners that the [MISC Haitian  ] people and their legitimate government support [ORG MINUSTAH  ] 's presence , and that the [ORG UN  ] is here at the express request of the Government of [LOC Haiti  ] . 
We must be sensitive to [MISC Latin  ] fears that any [MISC Haitian  ] opposition to the [ORG UN  ] presence undermines their domestic support for deployments in [LOC Haiti  ] . 
During the April riots , the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG MINUSTAH Force  ] Commander told Ambassador and others that his greatest fear was that his troops would be forced to fire on demonstrators . 
He understood that this could ignite opposition in [LOC Haiti  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] , and other contributing countries to his troops' presence in [LOC Haiti  ] . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] Embassy 's national day celebration in [LOC Port  ] au Prince September 8 was an exercise aimed at the [MISC Brazilian  ] domestic audience . 
Attended by several [MISC Brazilian  ] senators , it featured slide paels extolling the humanitarian work of [LOC Brazil  ] 's army at home and in [LOC Haiti  ] , and a pathos-filled speech by the Ambassador about the history and culture [LOC Brazil  ] shares with [LOC Haiti.  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) The [LOC Port  ] au Prince embassies of [MISC Latin  ] countries contributing to [ORG MINUSTAH  ] look to the strength of the [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to the [ORG UN  ] presence as a bellwether . 
Any slippage of [LOC U.S.  ] commitment would embolden domestic elements who oppose these countries' participation in in the [ORG UN  ] mission here . 
We sense that the strong [LOC U.S.  ] embrace of the [ORG UN  ] presence in [LOC Haiti  ] helps their case at home for continuing deployments in [LOC Haiti  ] . 
The Embassy uses every opportunity to partner publicly with and support [ORG MINUSTAH  ] . 
The current post-hurricane relief effort , however disordered , is proving an opportunity for [LOC U.S.  ] , [MISC Canadian  ] , and other bilateral donors to partner with [ORG MINUSTAH  ] in disaster assistance and reconstruction . 
We sense that the humanitarian focus of these crisis-response efforts -- in contrast to riot-control efforts in April -- is helping the case in [MISC Latin  ] countries for continuing their peacekeeping contributions in [LOC Haiti.  ] <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) The [ORG USG  ] in [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC New York  ] , and in [MISC Latin  ] capitals must also do their part to buck up support for [ORG MINUSTAH  ] . 
In [LOC UN Security Council  ] discussions of [MISC Haiti-related  ] items , [LOC U.S.  ] rhetorical appreciation for the [ORG UN  ] presence here helps reassure contributor countries that their deployments are justified . 
Similar expressions of support to [MISC Latin  ] representatives in [LOC Washington  ] and [MISC Latin  ] capitals are also helpful. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) In the end , what will maintain [MISC MINISTAH  ] participants' support for deployments in [LOC Haiti  ] is progress toward [MISC Haitian  ] stabilization and state viability . 
Continuing the [ORG UN  ] presence at projected levels for three to five years will not guarantee that result , but abruptly downsizing or prematurely withdrawing it will make more likely a result in [LOC Haiti  ] we do not want , and would make future hemispheric peacekeeping efforts more difficult to justify .
