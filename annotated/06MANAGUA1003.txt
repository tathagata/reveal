The first cable focused on [PER Daniel Ortega  ] and his family , while this one centers on the abuses of the [MISC Sandinistas  ] more broadly , both when they were in power during the 1980s and subsequently . 
The third and final cable will focus on [PER Arnoldo Aleman  ] and his family . 
As noted in reftel , post intends to use the information from these " rap sheets " in discussions with domestic and international interlocutors as a means of reminding [MISC Nicaraguan  ] voters and others of the true character of [PER Aleman  ] , [PER Ortega  ] , and the [MISC Sandinistas  ] . 
While the summaries themselves are unclassified , some of the sources of information are [ORG SBU  ] .

THE RECORD OF THE 1980S FLSN REGIME AND SUBSEQUENT SANDINISTA ABUSES OF POWER - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Rampant [ORG FSLN Human Rights Abuses  ] , including Torture , Disappearances , and Murder - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [ORG FSLN  ] regime declared a permanent " state of emergency " and interned and tortured thousands of people at prisons and camps scattered all over [LOC Nicaragua  ] . 
The [ORG Sandinista State Security Directorate  ] operated a network of special prisons where those held had no legal rights or protections whatsoever . 
In the mid-1980s , the regime had over 6500 political prisoners , the largest number in the entire hemisphere. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Many prisoners were held for up to two years without ever being charged or facing a judge . 
The largest torture camp for political prisoners was in what is now the free trade zone near [LOC Managua  ] 's airport . 
The regime also ordered numerous murders and disappearances , including the killings of hundreds of [MISC Miskitos  ] on the [LOC Atlantic  ] coast and the internment of thousands more in concentration camps in 1981 and 1982 . 
These crimes against humanity were ordered by [PER Daniel Ortega  ] , [PER Humberto Ortega  ] , [PER Tomas Borge  ] , [PER Lenin Cerna  ] , and [PER Omar Cabezas  ] , among others. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Sources: Sandinista declarations on the " state of emergency " and their incarcerations of political prisoners are a matter of public record ; the [MISC CPDH  ] human rights organization also has tens of thousands of complaints of 1980s rights abuses and on the imprisonment of political prisoners . 
This information was published in regular reports by the [MISC CPDH  ] throughout the 1980s and remains documented in the organization 's archives . 
The [ORG State Department  ] 's [ORG annual Human Rights Reports  ] also documented many of the worst abuses . 
Many victims remain alive to this day and continue to testify regarding the abuses they suffered . 
[ORG FSLN Wrecks Economy  ] and Sets it back 50 years - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) By the 1970s , [LOC Nicaragua  ] had developed one of the most advanced economies in [LOC Central America  ] , with so many jobs being created that workers from other [MISC Central American  ] countries came to [LOC Nicaragua  ] seeking employment . 
[LOC Nicaragua  ] was known as the bread basket of the region . 
When the [ORG FSLN  ] came to power in 1979 and began confiscating property ( over 170,000 total properties ) , driving out investors , and setting up a state-run soviet-style economy , it destroyed all the progress that had been made , setting the national economy back at least fifty years . 
GDP per person declined an average of 5.7 percent per year , exports declined 3 percent per year , and the [MISC Sandinistas  ] ran up [LOC Nicaragua  ] 's external debt to over 10 billion dollars ( more than seven times GDP ) . 
For comparison 's sake , external debt in 1979 , when the [MISC Sandinistas  ] took power , was only 1.5 billion dollars ( 97 percent of GDP ) . <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Under the [MISC Sandinistas  ] , the currency was constantly devalued , hyperinflation reached 33,500 percent in 1988 , and production plummeted , forcing [MISC Nicaraguans  ] to suffer shortages and rationing of even the most basic goods . 
Although progress has been made since 1990 , the economy has still not fully recovered from [ORG FSLN  ] mismanagement . 
Because of the [ORG FSLN  ] , instead of other [MISC Central Americans  ] coming to [LOC Nicaragua  ] to seek jobs , the country now faces a situation in which hundreds of thousands of its people have had to leave their country to seek jobs elsewhere. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Sources: Detailed documentation on the decline of the [MISC Nicaraguan  ] economy is a matter of public record ; all of the information is available in the records of the [MISC Nicaraguan  ] [ORG Central Bank  ] . 
[MISC Nicaraguans  ] old enough to remember both the pre-Sandinista and the [MISC Sandinista  ] economies can also bear witness to the economic devastation caused by the [ORG FSLN  ] . 
Based on analysis of records from numerous government ministries , President [PER Bolanos  ] and his government estimated that the [ORG FSLN  ] regime set the [MISC Nicaraguan  ] economy back at least 50 years . 
Censorship and Harassment of the Media - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [ORG FSLN  ] regime eliminated nearly all independent media in [LOC Nicaragua  ] , censored all sensitive information , and constantly harassed [ORG La Prensa  ] and the two main independent radio stations that survived . 
Journalists were regularly arrested and held without charge , [ORG La Prensa  ] was shut down on numerous occasions , and many journalists and editors were forced into exile. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) On one occasion , Interior Minister [PER Tomas Borge  ] summoned journalist [PER Jose Castillo Osejo  ] to his home and then personally physically assaulted him . 
[PER Castillo  ] , currently a [ORG National Assembly  ] deputy , was one of the owners of the independent [ORG Radio Corporacion  ] , and had often used the station to criticize the [ORG FSLN  ] . 
At the same time , the regime monitored phone calls , opened private mail , and used its control of the media , and its famous literacy campaign , to bombard the [MISC Nicaraguan  ] people with communist propaganda. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG FSLN  ] efforts to harass the media have continued even since the party left power in 1990 . 
In 2006 the [MISC Sandinista  ] caucus in the [ORG National Assembly  ] rammed through the new [LOC Arce Law  ] , named for [ORG FSLN National Assembly  ] member [PER Bayardo Arce  ] , its chief advocate . 
The law significantly reduced the tax exonerations that media outlets may obtain for imported materials and equipment . 
These tax exonerations helped the print and other media to keep prices low to enable wide access to information . 
Media outlets reported that the law resulted in significant bureaucratic delays that slowed the importation of needed printing supplies and equipment. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Sources: Any journalist who lived through this period in [LOC Nicaragua  ] or was forced into exile can testify to the effect of [ORG FSLN  ] media policies , as [PER Jose Castillo Osejo  ] has done . 
Police records also document the arrest of journalists , and [ORG La Prensa  ] has reported widely on the constant harassment it suffered . 
The [ORG State Department  ] 's [ORG annual Human Rights Report  ] and complaints filed with the [MISC CPDH  ] human rights organization also document [ORG FSLN  ] abuses of the media . 
Promotion of Terrorism and Efforts to [MISC Destabilize Neighboring Countries  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [ORG FSLN  ] regime was not content to run [LOC Nicaragua  ] into the ground , and sought to export its failed communist revolution to all of [LOC Nicaragua  ] 's neighbors and countries as far away as [LOC Argentina  ] . 
The regime smuggled weapons to leftist guerrillas in [LOC El Salvador  ] , [LOC Honduras  ] , [LOC Guatemala  ] and elsewhere . 
At the same time , terrorists from all over the world found a safe haven in [LOC Nicaragua  ] , and many obtaind [MISC Ncragancitizenship.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG FSLN  ] leaders , including [PER Humberto Ortega  ] , have admitted publicly that leaders of the [MISC Argentine  ] leftist terrorist group " [MISC Los Montoneros  ] " resided in [LOC Nicaragua  ] and engaged in military activities with the [ORG FSLN  ] for an extended period in 1979-1981 . 
[PER Humberto Ortega  ] admitted that [PER Fernando Vaca Narvaja  ] , the leader of the group , resided in his house in [LOC Managua.  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Sources: [PER Daniel Ortega  ] has publicly admitted many of his terrorist connections , including the fact that he has received elections money from the government of [LOC Libya  ] . 
Many 1980s terrorists still live in [LOC Nicaragua  ] and have acquired [MISC Nicaraguan  ] citizenship ( including at least one prominent member of the [ORG Italian Red Brigades  ] ) . 
[PER Daniel Ortega  ] publicly associated with many of these individuals in [LOC Nicaragua  ] throughout the 1980s . 
Harassment of the [MISC Roman Catholic  ] Church and [ORG Civil Society  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [ORG FSLN  ] regularly harassed , arrested , and abused the [MISC Catholic  ] Church and civil society . 
In August 1982 the [ORG FSLN  ] set a trap for [ORG Monsignor Bismarck Carballo  ] , who ran the Church 's independent [ORG Radio Corporation  ] by luring him to the home of a woman who claimed to be having domestic problems and needed his help . 
[ORG FSLN  ] thugs assaulted [MISC Caballo  ] , stripped him naked and then trotted him in front of the national media waiting outside in a disgusting effort to discredit the priest . 
In 1983 the [ORG FSLN  ] even went so far as to harass [PER Pope John Paul  ] II when he visited [LOC Nicaragua  ] . 
The regime tried to prevent people from coming to [LOC Managua  ] to hear the [PER Pope  ] speak , shut off the lights and sound during his public address , and placed [ORG FSLN  ] agitators at the front of the crowd to shout at the [PER Pope  ] throughout his speech. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Sources: The harassment and abuse of [ORG Monsignor Carballo  ] was filmed by the [MISC Sandinista  ] media and broadcast countrywide . 
The harassment of [PER Pope John Paul  ] II was also filmed and videotapes showing the harassment are now widely available . 
Among other locations , they are sold in stands at [LOC Managua  ] 's airport . 
Rampant [MISC Sandinista  ] Anti-Semitism and [MISC Anti-Semitic Violence  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [MISC Nicaraguan  ] [MISC Jewish  ] community , which numbered 200 in the early 1970s , was reduced to approximately 50 individuals after the [MISC Sandinista  ] takeover in July 1979 . 
With the support of the [ORG Palestine Liberation Organization  ] , an anti-Semitic campaign began in 1977 when [MISC Sandinistas  ] defaced [LOC Managua  ] 's synagogue with anti-Jewish and anti-Israel slogans . 
In 1978 , the same synagogue was firebombed during Saturday religious services . 
Younger members of the congregation were forced to evacuate elderly Holocaust survivors while the synagogue burned and the [MISC Sandinista  ] bombers tried to force them all to remain inside the burning building . 
Many of the elderly Holocaust survivors had also lived through the November 1938 " Night of [ORG Broken Glass  ] " ( Kristallnacht ) , during which the [MISC Nazi  ] regime orchestrated attacks on [MISC Jews  ] , [MISC Jewish-owned  ] businesses , and [ORG Synagogues  ] all across [LOC Germany  ] and [LOC Austria.  ] <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) After the triumph of the [MISC Sandinista  ] revolution in 1979 , [MISC Jews  ] who had been residing temporarily outside [LOC Nicaragua  ] were not permitted to return . 
When 70-year-old [PER Abraham Gorn  ] was identified as the president of the [MISC Nicaraguan  ] [MISC Jewish  ] community , he was jailed for two weeks and forced to sweep streets . 
His factory was expropriated , his bank account seized and he was evicted from his home . 
Numerous other members of the [MISC Jewish  ] community suffered similar forms of harassment . 
The July 15 and 17 , 1982 editions of the government-controlled newspaper [ORG El Nuevo Diario  ] denounced [MISC Jews  ] . 
The [MISC Sandinista  ] regime labeled [MISC Jewish  ] houses of worship " [ORG Synagogues  ] of [LOC Satan  ] . 
" The [MISC Sandinistas  ] converted [LOC Managua  ] 's synagogue ( the same one they firebombed in 1978 ) into an elite social club for the children of high-ranking [MISC Sandinista  ] officials. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Sources: Testimony of leaders of the [MISC Jewish  ] community who experienced the [MISC Sandinista  ] firebombing of the [LOC Managua  ] synagogue and other anti-Semitic [ORG FSLN  ] acts , [ORG State Department Human Rights Reports  ] , 1986 Special [ORG State Department Report:  ] " [ORG Human Rights in Nicaragua  ] under the [MISC Sandinistas  ] " , 1986 [ORG State Department Publication:  ] " In Their Own Words: Testimony of [MISC Nicaraguan  ] Exiles . 
" Rigging of Elections - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) In 1984 the [ORG FSLN  ] held rigged national elections in which all other parties withdrew because of blatant [MISC Sandinista  ] efforts to manipulate and control the outcome . 
Because of the [ORG FSLN  ] 's " state of emergency " no other party was allowed to organize or campaign . 
Opposition parties were censored and subjected to constant harassment , while the [ORG FSLN  ] subjected the [MISC Nicaraguan  ] people to a constant barrage of pro-Sandinista propaganda using all of the state-controlled media . 
[ORG FSLN  ] comandante [PER Bayardo Arce  ] , who oversaw the fraudulent elections , admitted that they were only held in the first place because of pressure from the [LOC United States.  ] <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Sources: The content of the [MISC Sandinista  ] " emergency decrees " is a matter of public record and was widely reported in the media even at the time . 
Specific abuses and efforts to manipulate the outcome of the elections were reported by the [ORG CPDH  ] human rights organization and the [ORG State Department  ] 's [ORG annual Human Rights Report  ] for 1984 . 
Murder of [LOC Contras  ] After they Disarm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) After the signing of the 1988-1989 peace accords and the holding of free elections in 1990 , the fighters of the armed resistance ( " [LOC Contras  ] " ) to the [ORG FSLN  ] regime disarmed as the peace accords required . 
However , the [ORG FSLN  ] leadership saw this as an opportunity for revenge , and had its assassins kill hundreds of [LOC Contras  ] , including ordering the murder of ex-Contra commander [PER Enrique Bermudez  ] in the parking lot of the intercontinental hotel ( today 's [ORG Hotel Crowne Plaza  ] ) in <a id='par1990' href='#par1990'>¶</a>1990. <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Sources: Such killings are widely documented in [MISC Nicaraguan  ] police and court records . 
No one was ever brought to justice in the crimes . 
Right down to the present day , friends and family members of [PER Bermudez  ] continue to call for a full investigation of his murder . 
Banning of [ORG Independent Unions  ] and Violations of Right to Organize and Strike - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Although they proclaimed themselves to be the champions of working people , the [MISC Sandinistas  ] banned any form of union organization or exercise of labor rights that they could not control . 
Those who tried to organize independent unions were regularly arrested and beaten , such as [PER Carlos Huembes  ] who was severely beaten by [ORG FSLN  ] thugs at the [LOC Managua  ] airport in February 1981 , at the same time the [ORG FSLN  ] vandalized his residence . 
In September 1981 , the [ORG FSLN  ] banned all strikes. <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Sources: Many of the [ORG FSLN  ] 's " emergency decrees " specifically restricted the right of people to organize and freely express their views , on labor matters or anything else . 
The [ORG FSLN  ] 's banning of all strikes is thus a matter of public record . 
[PER Carlos Huembes  ] has regularly and personally testified as to the abuses he suffered , as have many other independent labor leaders . 
[ORG Sandinistas Look  ] out for Themselves and the Wealthy , While the [MISC Poor Suffer  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Throughout the 1980s [MISC Sandinista  ] military " recruiters " traveled throughout [LOC Nicaragua  ] forcing boys and girls as young as twelve years of age to join the [MISC Sandinista  ] military , often effectively kidnapping them from their families and then sending them into combat with minimal training . 
However , only the poor were the victims of such [ORG FSLN  ] press gangs , as the children of the [MISC Sandinista  ] elite and the wealthy were largely exempt. <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) While [MISC Sandinista  ] economic mismanagement and draconian state controls wrecked the economy and forced most [MISC Nicaraguans  ] to live in abject poverty and survive on extremely limited food rations , the [MISC Sandinista  ] elite lived in luxury , enjoying the fruits of the property , businesses and other economic resources that they had seized when they took power . 
Today , while [PER Ortega  ] and the rest of the [MISC Sandinista  ] elite reside in mansions and are chauffeured around in [PER Mercedes Benzes  ] and other luxury vehicle , this same [MISC Sandinista  ] leadership promotes strikes that prevent the poor from receiving medical care and from having access to public transportation. <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) In October 2005 [MISC Sandinista  ] members of the [LOC Managua  ] city council cut a deal with their [ORG PLC  ] colleagues to build two expensive monuments to their respective historical " heroes " ( [PER Jose Santos Zelaya  ] for the [ORG PLC  ] and [PER Rigoberto Lopez  ] Perez--the assassin who killed the first [PER Somoza  ] in 1956--for the [ORG FSLN  ] ) at a total cost of 3 million cordobas ( USD 175,000 ) in taxpayer money from the city budget , more than the [ORG PLC  ] and [ORG FSLN  ] councilors assigned to all city social programs combined. <a id='par29' href='#par29'>¶</a>29 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Sources: Any [MISC Nicaraguan  ] old enough to remember the 1980s can testify about the [ORG FSLN  ] " press gangs " that tore minors away from their families and forced them to serve in the [MISC Sandinista  ] army . 
Thousands of young people fled [LOC Nicaragua  ] and went into exile to avoid such forced military service . 
To see the current lifestyle of the [ORG FSLN  ] elite , one need only look at the homes they live in , the cars they drive , and the opulence of their lifestyle and travels . 
It is also widely known and reported in the media that [PER Ortega  ] and the [ORG FSLN  ] control all of the unions and the politically-motivated strikes that often make life miserable for ordinary [MISC Nicaraguans  ] , preventing them from getting to work or receiving medical care . 
Involvement with [ORG Drug Traffickers  ] and use of [ORG Drug Money for Campaign Finance  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par30' href='#par30'>¶</a>30 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Daniel Ortega  ] and the [MISC Sandinista  ] have regularly received money to finance [ORG FSLN  ] electoral campaigns from international drug traffickers , usually in return for ordering [MISC Sandinista  ] judges to allow traffickers caught by the police and military to go free . 
Most of these schemes are orchestrated by [PER Lenin Cerna  ] , the former Director of [ORG State Security  ] , and are supervised by [ORG Sandinista Supreme Court  ] judges such as [PER Rafael Solis  ] and [PER Roger Camillo Arguello  ] . 
Non-drug traffickers , including corrupt associates of [PER Arnoldo Aleman  ] such as [PER Byron Jerez  ] , have also paid bribes to the [ORG FSLN  ] judicial " campaign finance " machine in return for not guilty verdicts. <a id='par31' href='#par31'>¶</a>31 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) In one notorious case in 2005 widely reported in the media , [ORG Supreme Court  ] magistrate [PER Arguello  ] coordinated a complicated scheme to make 609,000 dollars in drug money seized from two [MISC Colombians  ] " disappear " from a [ORG Supreme Court  ] account . 
There are credible reports that some of the money went to fund upcoming [ORG FSLN  ] electoral campaigns , while the rest went to individual [MISC Sandinista  ] judges , including [PER Solis  ] and [LOC Arguello.  ] <a id='par32' href='#par32'>¶</a>32 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) In another one of many examples , prosecutors have accused [PER Rigoberto Gonzalez Garbach  ] , a [MISC Sandinista  ] candidate for elected office in [LOC Puerto Cabezas  ] in the March 2006 Atlantic Coast regional elections , of attempting to bribe a judge with 108,500 dollars in return for freeing convicted drug trafficker [PER Marvin Funez  ] . 
According to prosecutors , this was not the first time that [PER Rigoberto Gonzalez Garbach  ] had tried to bribe judges to free drug traffickers. <a id='par33' href='#par33'>¶</a>33 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) In 1984 [PER Daniel Ortega  ] negotiated a deal with [MISC Colombian  ] drug kingpin [PER Pablo Escobar  ] whereby [PER Escobar  ] received refuge for several months in [LOC Nicaragua  ] after he had ordered the killing of the [MISC Colombian  ] Minister of Justice . 
At the same time , [PER Escobar  ] 's drug trafficking operation received [PER Ortega  ] 's approval to land and load airplanes in [LOC Nicaragua  ] as they sought to ship cocaine to the [LOC United States  ] . 
In return , [PER Ortega  ] and the [ORG FSLN  ] received large cash payments from [PER Escobar  ] . 
Interior Minister [PER Tomas Borge  ] and his subordinates went so far as to assist [PER Escobar  ] with the loading and unloading of drugs onto his airplanes in [LOC Nicaragua  ] . 
The [ORG Drug Enforcement Agency  ] ( [ORG DEA  ] ) managed to place a hidden camera on one of [PER Escobar  ] 's airplanes and obtained film of [PER Escobar  ] and Ministry of the Interior officials loading cocaine onto one of [PER Escobar  ] 's planes at [LOC Managua  ] 's international airport . 
[ORG CBS  ] news later broadcast the film and the entire story of [MISC Escobar-Ortega-FSLN  ] collaboration is related in detail in a 2005 book by [PER Astrid Legarda Martinez: El Verdadero Pablo: Sangre  ] , Traicion y Muerte ( [LOC Colombia  ] , [PER Ediciones Dipon  ] ) . <a id='par34' href='#par34'>¶</a>34 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Sources: Everyone in [LOC Nicaragua  ] knows that [PER Ortega  ] and the [ORG FSLN  ] control the judiciary , with at least 75 percent of all judges being self-described [MISC Sandinista  ] militants . 
The specific cases described above have all been widely reported by media all across the political spectrum . 
Although his name does not often appear in the media , everyone in [LOC Nicaragua  ] 's political circles knows that [PER Lenin Cerna  ] remains [PER Daniel Ortega  ] 's chief political " fixer . 
" The [PER Pablo Escobar  ] footage was filmed June 24 , 1984 . 
The media have widely reported on the [ORG FSLN  ] 's use of the judiciary for campaign finance purposes and credible confidential sources have confirmed the practice on numerous occasions . 
[ORG FSLN Condones  ] and Supports Domestic and Sexual Violence - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par35' href='#par35'>¶</a>35 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) In 1998 [PER Zoilamerica Narvaez  ] , the daughter of [PER Rosario Murillo  ] and the step-daughter of [PER Daniel Ortega  ] , made allegations that [PER Ortega  ] had raped and sexually abused her over a period of many years . 
However , [PER Ortega  ] used his immunity as a [ORG National Assembly  ] deputy and his control of the courts to ensure that the case never went to trial . 
Having ensured he would never face trial , [PER Ortega  ] then actively sabotaged all efforts by the [MISC Nicaraguan  ] government to provide justice to [PER Narvaez  ] and used his mother and [PER Rosario Murillo  ] in a public relations campaign intended to bury the allegations. <a id='par36' href='#par36'>¶</a>36 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) In September 2004 , boxer [PER Ricardo Mayorga  ] allegedly raped a young woman in a [LOC Managua  ] hotel . 
Sensing an opportunity to blackmail [PER Mayorga  ] , [PER Ortega  ] and the [ORG FSLN  ] agreed to protect the boxer in the courts if he would give the party a large portion of his international boxing winnings and " advertise " for [PER Daniel  ] in public . 
[PER Mayorga  ] agreed , and an [ORG FSLN  ] judge found him not guilty in December . 
Much of [PER Mayorga  ] 's winnings now reportedly go to [PER Ortega  ] , and when [PER Mayorga  ] fought in [LOC Chicago  ] in August 2005 , he dedicated the fight to [PER Daniel  ] , wore the [ORG FSLN  ] colors , and flashed the number of the [ORG FSLN  ] slot on the electoral ballot ( " casilla " ) to the international media. <a id='par37' href='#par37'>¶</a>37 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Such misogynistic attitudes are common in the [ORG FSLN  ] , as is the tolerance of domestic and sexual violence . 
When [ORG FSLN National Assembly  ] deputies voted to lower the criminal penalties for statutory rape in March 2006 , [ORG FSLN  ] deputy [PER Nathan Sevilla  ] justified the vote by stating that sex with minors was " normal " in rural [LOC Nicaragua  ] and thus should not be considered a serious crime. <a id='par38' href='#par38'>¶</a>38 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Sources: personal testimony of [LOC Zoilamerica  ] , legal documents filed by [PER Zoilamerica  ] in [MISC Nicaraguan  ] institutions ( including the courts , the police and the office of the [ORG Human Rights Ombudsman  ] ) and the [ORG IACHR  ] , media records of [PER Ortega  ] 's " public relations " campaign using [PER Rosario Murillo  ] and his own mother . 
Sources for the [PER Mayorga  ] case include media accounts of [PER Mayorga  ] 's arrest , trial , his public " pro-Daniel " comments and his August 2005 fight , private testimony offered by lawyers involved in the case , and the testimony of the rape victim . 
[PER Sevilla  ] 's comments were widely reported in the media . 
[ORG FSLN Continues  ] to Use Land and Property " Pinatas " for Campaign Finance - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par39' href='#par39'>¶</a>39 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) As has been widely reported in the [MISC Nicaraguan  ] media , in addition to using its control of the judiciary to campaign finance from drug traffickers , the [ORG FSLN  ] is still involved in numerous land and property " pi$atas " that bring huge amounts of money into party coffers . 
Although the [ORG FSLN  ] uses a variety of scams to rob both domestic and foreign property owners and investors , the most common technique seems to be to have [ORG FSLN  ] lawyers bring spurious charges of violations of oral labor " contracts " against property owners and companies . 
[ORG FSLN  ] judges then rule in favor of the lawyer making the complaint , and issue huge judgments for damages against the property owner , or simply seize the property in question and hand it to the [MISC Sandinista  ] lawyer for use or sale . 
The resulting profits go straight to [ORG FSLN  ] coffers . 
In other cases seized properties have been spuriously " auctioned " to the [ORG FSLN  ] at no cost. <a id='par40' href='#par40'>¶</a>40 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Among those attacked by the [ORG FSLN  ] money-making machine in this manner have been international investors from [LOC Spain  ] and the [LOC United States  ] , as well as government entities such as the [MISC Nicaraguan  ] [ORG Basic Foodstuffs Company  ] ( [ORG Enabas  ] ) . 
In some cases , such as that of the [MISC Spanish  ] investors , the properties in question have been worth over one and a half million dollars . 
In another case involving [MISC Sandinista  ] judges in [LOC Catarina  ] , the [ORG FSLN  ] acquired buildings and property worth 700,000 dollars in the same manner. <a id='par41' href='#par41'>¶</a>41 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Sources: These cases have been widely reported in all of the [MISC Nicaraguan  ] media since they became public knowledge in February 2006 . 
The victims in the various cases have all publicly testified regarding the [ORG FSLN  ] legal shenanigans to defraud them .
