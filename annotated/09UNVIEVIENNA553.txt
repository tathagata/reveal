( C ) Summary . 
On December 3 , former [MISC Austrian  ] Ambassador to [LOC Tehran  ] [PER Michael Postl  ] ( please protect ) debriefed [PER MsnOff  ] on his final calls on [MISC Iranian  ] officials as he left post . 
He noted that former Presidents [PER Khatami  ] and [PER Rafsanjani  ] both had extracted themselves from the normal political scene and were focused on tangential issues where their weight could still be felt . 
Nevertheless , [PER Rafsanjani  ] suggested that it would be helpful if the [LOC West  ] spoke out against the election fraud and human rights violations that followed. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Postl  ] said that President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's chief of cabinet , [PER Mashaie  ] , made clear to him prior to the [LOC Geneva  ] talks that [LOC Iran  ] was planning to approach the talks with a spirit of compromise and that [PER Postl  ] would be " surprised " by [LOC Iran  ] 's attitude . 
[PER Postl  ] explained the lack of follow-through in the wake of the talks as a probable decision by Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] that the [LOC West  ] was not trustworthy or that [LOC Iran  ] could get more from the [MISC P5  ] plus 1 than the six offered in [LOC Geneva  ] . 
Majles Speaker [PER Larijani  ] 's outspoken disapproval of the [ORG Tehran Research Reactor  ] deal advocated by [PER Ahmadinejad  ] could have been an exercise of [PER Larijani  ] 's first opportunity to undermine [PER Ahmadinejad  ] after he was pressured to disavow himself of knowledge that [MISC Iranian  ] prisoners were being raped in jail , which lost him credibility with the [MISC Iranian  ] public . 
Finally , [PER Postl  ] argued that the [LOC U.S.  ] should focus its outreach to [LOC Iran  ] on formats that [MISC Iranians  ] perceive are less biased , such as [ORG BBC Persian  ] 's version of [LOC Hardtalk  ] or Press TV . 
End Summary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) On December 3 , former [MISC Austrian  ] Ambassador to [LOC Tehran  ] [PER Michael Postl  ] gave [PER MsnOff  ] a readout of the state of domestic political wranglings in [LOC Tehran  ] prior to his departure from post in October . 
Now posted in [LOC Vienna  ] , [PER Postl  ] noted that he still advises the [MISC Austrian  ] government on [LOC Iran  ] issues and that he was recently asked to see if his contacts in [LOC Iran  ] would meet with him even though he had departed post . 
Many said that they would , so he may be asked by the [MISC Austrian  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] to return to [LOC Iran  ] periodically to make use of the excellent contacts he was afforded given his [PER Farsi  ] skills and native [MISC Iranian  ] wife. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Postl  ] recounted his final calls on contacts in [LOC Iran  ] before leaving post , noting that many who had refused meetings with him after the elections were now willing to meet him . 
When he met with former President [PER Khatami  ] , [PER Khatami  ] noted that because of the post-election environment , it did not make sense to talk about politics . 
[PER Postl  ] suggested that they discuss the possibility of [PER Khatami  ] pursuing a dialogue of civilizations or religions that might give him an opening to the [LOC West  ] . 
[PER Khatami  ] noted that he did want to focus more on that kind of dialogue and engagement and that he might come to [LOC Austria  ] next year in pursuit of such discussions. ------------------------------------------- Final Calls Reveal Disillusionment with the Possibilities for Change ------------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Postl  ] noted that in his final calls , he sought out a meeting with the new health minister , [PER Marzieh Vahid Dastjerdi  ] since he was interested in meeting the [LOC Islamic Republic  ] 's first female minister . 
[PER Postl  ] described her as " sort of a puppet " and very insecure despite her good credentials for the job . 
She is a member of the [PER Larijani  ] family , giving this influential clan placement in the executive branch , in addition to the leverage they hold through the key posts of [PER Ali Larijani  ] as Majles Speaker and [PER Javad Larijani  ] as head of the Judiciary . 
In their meeting , [PER Dastjerdi  ] and [PER Postl  ] discussed possible cooperation between [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Austria  ] in hospitals , training , and person-to-person contacts in the medical field. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Postl  ] also called on the powerful new chief of President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's cabinet , [PER Mashaie  ] . 
[PER Postl  ] said that many believed that [PER Mashaie  ] 's rejection for a vice presidential post showed that there were disagreements between [PER Ahmadinejad  ] and the Supreme Leader , but the fact that he was given the slot as head of the cabinet means that [PER Khamenei  ] must not be fundamentally opposed to him . 
[PER Postl  ] was candid with [PER Mashaie  ] , noting that although the [MISC Iranian  ] elections were an internal matter , the treatment of civilians in the aftermath of the elections was wrong by any calculation . 
[PER Postl  ] assessed that using [PER Farsi  ] instead of [MISC English  ] made a difference in the reaction he received to this candor , and [PER Mashaie  ] said that he would be pleased to meet with [PER Postl  ] again if he were in [LOC Iran  ] . 
UNVIE VIEN 00000553 002 OF 004 <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) In what [PER Postl  ] believes was the first meeting former President [PER Rafsanjani  ] had granted to a [MISC Westerner  ] -- and perhaps the first meeting with a foreigner -- since the elections , the two discussed economic cooperation , which [PER Rafsanjani  ] said was his primary focus . 
They avoided the topics of the election and the nuclear issue , especially given the presence of 10 to 15 " watchers " from different veins of the [MISC Iranian  ] government . 
[PER Rafsanjani  ] was very interested in non-nuclear energy cooperation and asked very detailed questions about wind energy , which [PER Postl  ] said [LOC Austria  ] would be able to help with . 
[PER Rafsanjani  ] also discussed his sense of how the [MISC Iranian  ] government could evolve , arguing that change must come from within [LOC Iran  ] and that interference from foreigners was not welcome in most circumstances . 
Nevertheless , [PER Rafsanjani  ] believed that the best help possible from foreigners would be to say that the elections were not fair and to note the human rights violations in the aftermath , though he was not specific about what he thought the influence of such statements would be . 
[PER Postl  ] noted that recent months clearly had been hard on [PER Rafsanjani  ] ; he looked pale and had lost a lot of weight , but his eyes were still " active , " according to [PER Postl.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Postl  ] described the positions of presidential candidates [PER Karrubi  ] and [PER Musavi  ] as children of the revolution and argued that neither of them wants systemic change . 
Rather , they hoped to give [LOC Iran  ] a " human face . 
" Since the " population of [LOC Iran  ] , " according to [PER Postl  ] , opposes the [MISC Islamic  ] system , the people are not very strongly behind either of these candidates . 
In closing out his comments on his final meetings in [LOC Tehran  ] , [PER Postl  ] noted that after he departed post , his contacts were questioned thoroughly and aggressively , which [PER Postl  ] described as a reality of life in [LOC Iran  ] and contact with a [MISC Westerner.  ] -------------------------------- Infighting and Confusion Driving the [ORG Nuclear Issue  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) In his discussions at the end of September with [PER Mashaie  ] , [PER Postl  ] encouraged him to ensure that [LOC Iran  ] did not " miss the opportunity " presented by the talks in [LOC Geneva  ] . 
[PER Mashaie  ] responded that [LOC Iran  ] would be " sure to take " advantage of this opportunity and told [PER Postl  ] that [PER Postl  ] would be surprised at [LOC Iran  ] 's approach , that [LOC Iran  ] would come with seriousness and an attitude of compromise . 
[PER Postl  ] 's assessment is that [LOC Iran  ] decided that this was the right time to show flexibility in order to get an agreement , especially since [PER Ahmadinejad  ] wants to claim responsibility for an agreement with the [LOC West  ] . 
[PER Postl  ] believes that [ORG Nuclear Negotiator Jalili  ] came to [LOC Geneva  ] with this spirit of compromise and was following direction , presumably from [PER Ahmadinejad  ] . 
[LOC Iran  ] 's failure to follow through on these agreements may have been due to a decision by [PER Khamenei  ] either that the [LOC West  ] was not trustworthy despite [LOC Iran  ] 's supposed good intentions or that [LOC Iran  ] could get more from the [LOC West  ] or P5 plus 1 than was offered in [LOC Geneva  ] . 
Despite the fact that people close to the President say he wants " more , " the system gets in the way as do [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's bad advisers . 
[PER Postl  ] 's interlocutors say that if [PER Ahmadinejad  ] alone were to decide about engagement with the [LOC West  ] , " things would move more quickly . 
" [PER Postl  ] noted that [PER Khamenei  ] is still respected in [LOC Iran  ] and , in his personal opinion , there is no essential divergence between the Supreme Leader and [PER Ahmadinejad  ] . 
On issues where the Supreme Leader 's opinions were clear , [PER Postl  ] argued that other influential [MISC Iranians  ] would not " touch on issues , " even to undercut [PER Ahmadinejad  ] . 
The only way to challenge these leaders was to focus on " unjust " or un-Islamic behavior. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Postl  ] said that Majles Speaker [PER Larijani  ] probably was not in favor of the [ORG Tehran Research Reactor  ] ( [ORG TRR  ] ) deal , but when [PER MsnOff  ] questioned whether he really opposed the deal or was responding to the fact that [PER Ahmadinejad  ] came out in favor of the deal , [PER Postl  ] recounted another possibility tied to the post-election environment . 
[PER Postl  ] noted that he had asked someone close to [PER Larijani  ] whether he was aware of the rapes of election-related prisoners . 
The interlocutors said that not only was [PER Larijani  ] aware , but all officials were aware of what was going on inside the prison . 
Nevertheless , when [PER Larijani  ] spoke publicly about the issue , he stated clearly that the rapes are not occurring and thus lost some credibility with the [MISC Iranian  ] public . 
To have not given a more ambiguous response , such as that he would look into the situation , [PER Larijani  ] must have been under strong pressure from above , in [PER Postl  ] 's estimation . 
Given the clarity that what [PER Ahmadinejad  ] had done after the election was wrong and [PER Larijani  ] 's distaste for [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , the [ORG TRR  ] proposal may have been [PER Larijani  ] 's first opportunity to strike back at UNVIE VIEN 00000553 003 OF 004 Ahmadinejad. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Postl  ] also noted that [LOC Iran  ] probably has whiplash from the international community 's response to the [ORG Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant  ] ( [ORG FFEP  ] ) , which will complicate our efforts to press [LOC Iran  ] into compliance with its obligations . 
Although [ORG IAEA  ] Director General [PER ElBaradei  ] said after the first inspection of the [ORG FFEP  ] that it was nothing more than " a hole in a mountain , " the [ORG IAEA Board of Governors  ] passed a resolution against [LOC Iran  ] , citing the [ORG FFEP  ] as one of its main points ( ref A ) . 
[PER Postl  ] argued that this probably leads [LOC Iran  ] to believe that the international community is not serious about the issue , and that , rather , this is " a game . 
" <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) One of [PER Postl  ] 's contacts close to the Supreme Leader pointed him to a [MISC Kayhan  ] article from December 1 , written by editor [PER Shariatmadari  ] , which espouses the views of [PER Khamenei  ] on the nuclear issue . 
The article argues that [LOC Iran  ] has gotten nothing from cooperation and should withdraw from the NPT immediately . 
Since [PER Khamenei  ] has said that he is not opposed to an opening with the [LOC U.S.  ] , it becomes about [LOC Washington  ] presenting the right arguments at the right time . 
However , [PER Postl  ] said that bringing up the issue of the detained [MISC Americans  ] at [LOC Geneva  ] probably fell flat with the [MISC Iranians  ] . 
[MISC Iranian  ] officials told [PER Postl  ] that they were surprised that [MISC American  ] officials raised this issue at those talks . 
This was the wrong time to bring up this issue , [PER Postl  ] argued , since these issues are not connected in the minds of the [MISC Iranians  ] . 
( We will explain to the [MISC Austrians  ] why this issue is so important and resonates so much to the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) [PER Postl  ] suggested that the [LOC UK  ] model was better: when their sailors were captured , [LOC UK  ] officials said that this issue had nothing to do with the political problems between the two countries . 
The dissociation of the issues worked in favor of getting the sailors released . 
Pressed on when might be such a right time to address the [LOC U.S.  ] detainees , [PER Postl  ] suggested that one such way might have been to capitalize on the October 1 [LOC Geneva  ] talks by following up quickly with a call from Under Secretary [PER Burns  ] to [ORG Jalili  ] " in the spirit of [LOC Geneva  ] . 
" During that phone call , [PER Burns  ] could engage [ORG Jalili  ] on the detainee issue as an aside . 
[PER Postl  ] also noted that some of his [MISC Iranian  ] government contacts had noted with pleasure the appointment of Ambassador [PER Limbert  ] to deal with the [MISC Iranian  ] file given his understanding of [LOC Iran.  ] ---------------------------- [PER Postl  ] 's [ORG Tehran Retrospective  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Looking back on his tenure as Ambassador to [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Postl  ] noted that the biggest " game changer " had been this past summer 's presidential elections . 
The events were causing backlash from much of the population . 
Parents and grandparents were saying , according to [PER Postl  ] , that they do not want their children to be forced to experience the same [LOC Iran  ] that they , themselves , have been living under for the last 30 years . 
For the first time , one can see " kill [PER Khamenei  ] " and " death to [PER Khamenei  ] " scrawled on walls in [LOC Tehran  ] . 
These direct challenges to [PER Khamenei  ] 's authority are new and significant . 
Additionally , [PER Postl  ] expects that the population was disillusioned by the overwhelming fraud in the elections and many will not vote in the future. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) On engagement , [PER Postl  ] suggested that some ways forward for the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Iran  ] might be to look into using a route from [PER Chah Bahar  ] , on [LOC Iran  ] 's southern coast , to get [LOC U.S.  ] supplies into [LOC Afghanistan  ] and using the assumption of office by new [ORG IAEA  ] Director General [PER Amano  ] to press for " a new start " on the Additional Protocol and additional transparency measures discussions. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER Postl  ] reiterated his message that [MISC Iranian  ] citizens see the [ORG Voice of America  ] ( [ORG VOA  ] ) as biased and asked that we not underestimate their frustration . 
If they see a pervasive media outlet as biased , this presents the [LOC U.S.  ] in a negative light and works against [LOC U.S.  ] messaging . 
He said that [MISC Iranians  ] currently are faced with two biased choices: [ORG VOA  ] and [ORG Iranian Broadcasting  ] ( [ORG IRIB  ] ) . 
In response to a [PER MsnOff  ] question about how [ORG BBC Persian  ] is perceived , he noted that it is seen as more neutral , but has the stigma of being associated with the [LOC UK  ] . 
[PER Postl  ] floated the idea of [LOC U.S.  ] support to [MISC Euro News  ] to start broadcasting in [LOC Farsi  ] . 
He also suggested that doing Hardtalk in [ORG Persian  ] might be one of the best outlets for [LOC U.S.  ] arguments since the format of pitting opposing viewpoints against one another would counteract the perception of bias , but suggested that if our arguments to the [MISC Iranian  ] people are not convincing , this quickly would become clear . 
Finally , [PER Postl  ] noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] should not shy away from interviews with [MISC Iranian  ] media outlets , suggesting Press TV because it is in [MISC English  ] and it is watched in [LOC Tehran  ] . 
A program built UNVIE VIEN 00000553 004 OF 004 around broadcasting the differing opinions of the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC India  ] ( because its opinion is well-respected given its influence as a leader in the [ORG Nonaligned Movement  ] ) , and [LOC Iran  ] might be a useful way to get our messages across while counteracting perceptions of bias .
