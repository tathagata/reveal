( C ) SUMMARY . 
In addition to the meetings described in [LOC Ref A  ] , DHS Secretary [PER Janet Napolitano  ] held meetings on July 1 with [LOC Spain  ] 's Second Vice President , [PER Elena Salgado  ] , who also serves as Minister of [ORG Economy and Finance  ] , [ORG Interior  ] Minister [PER Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba  ] , and Justice Minister [PER Francisco Caamano  ] . 
While the meeting with the [ORG Ministry of Economy and Finance  ] focused on combating financial and customs crimes , the meetings at the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] addressed several ways to strengthen bilateral and [MISC U.S.-EU  ] cooperation . 
Talks with the Justice Minister centered around [ORG GOS  ] efforts to revitalize the transatlantic agenda during its [ORG EU Presidency  ] in early 2010 and on the reforms to [LOC Spain  ] 's " universal jurisdiction " law . 
[ORG Embassy Madrid  ] 's Charge d'Affaires [PER Chacon  ] and [ORG DHS/ICE Attache Alvarez  ] accompanied the Secretary and her delegation , which included Chief of Staff [PER Noah Kroloff  ] , [PER U/S Beers  ] , [PER A/S Smith  ] , [PER DAS Koumans  ] . 
END SUMMARY. //MEETING WITH SECOND VP AND MINISTER OF ECONOMY AND FINANCE SALGADO// <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) The Secretary discussed financial and customs crimes with [PER Salgado  ] and her staff , which included Secretary of State for [ORG Economy  ] ( vice minister ) [PER Jose Manuel Campa  ] , DG of the [ORG Treasury Soledad Nunez  ] , Customs Director [PER Nicolas Bonilla  ] , Customs Deputy Director for [MISC Investigation  ] and Enforcement [PER Maria Vicenta Abad  ] , Deputy DG of Inspection and Control of [ORG Capital Movements Juan Vega  ] , and Ministerial advisor [LOC Rufino de la Rosa  ] . 
The [ORG GOS  ] delegation praised existing bilateral cooperation and expressed a desire to continue strengthening it . 
[PER Campa  ] explained that the [ORG GOS  ] planned to submit to the [ORG Congress  ] in the next two weeks draft legislation to implement an [ORG EU Directive  ] on money laundering and terrorist financing . 
( [ORG Comment: Press  ] reports indicate that this is the third directive , 2005/60/CE , which was supposed to have been implemented by December 2007 . 
) The legislation also would contain language designed to prevent money laundering through the purchase of [ORG GOS  ] bonds . 
[PER Salgado  ] noted that [LOC Spain  ] chaired a [MISC European  ] regional working group in this area and was working closely with the [MISC USG.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Customs Director [PER Bonilla  ] cited three areas of cooperation with the [ORG USG  ] . 
Controlled deliveries of cash and the [ORG Container Security Initiative  ] ( [ORG CSI  ] ) in the ports of [LOC Algeciras  ] , [LOC Barcelona  ] , and [ORG Valencia  ] were working well , and the [ORG GOS  ] hoped the [ORG CSI  ] could be expanded to additional ports . 
The " [MISC Hands Across the World  ] " operation against bulk cash smuggling held June 10-16 at [LOC Madrid  ] 's [LOC Barajas  ] airport was successful in catching illegal couriers and in deterring such activity . 
The [ORG USG  ] also provided useful information on many cocaine shipments . 
In response to a question from the [ORG S  ] ecretary , [PER Salgado  ] noted her concern regarding cocaine trafficking and consumption dating from her earlier service as Health Minister . 
[PER Bonilla  ] said [MISC Mexicans  ] were replacing [MISC Colombians  ] as cocaine traffickers to [LOC Spain  ] . 
Representatives of his service and ICE had traveled together to [LOC Colombia  ] to open communication channels with [ORG GOC  ] officials . 
[PER Bonilla  ] said the [ORG GOS  ] also had a productive bilateral exchange with [MISC Mexican  ] officials . 
The Secretary and Minister [PER Salgado  ] agreed to expand cooperation to address the trafficking of drugs and cash from [LOC Colombia  ] and [LOC Mexico  ] to the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Spain  ] . 
The [ORG S  ] ecretary indicated [ORG Madrid ICE Attache Luis Alvarez  ] would have the lead for [MISC DHS.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Treasury  ] DG [PER Nunez  ] noted that the draft law implementing the [ORG EU  ] money laundering directive would create a database with names and account numbers for all financial accounts . 
At present , in order to freeze assets , the [ORG GOS  ] needed to ask all of the co3 " Q> 3azen , such as judicial orders based on probable cause to suspect tax fraud . 
[PER Nunez  ] also noted [ORG GOS  ] support for the [ORG EC  ] 's proposal on SWIFT data exchange to fight terrorist finance. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Secretary [PER Napolitano  ] asked whether proceeds from human trafficking were treated the same way as drug proceeds under [MISC Spanish  ] law and in terms of the database . 
[ORG Treasury  ] official [PER Vega  ] indicated that [MISC Spanish  ] law defined money laundering broadly , so that operations involving proceeds from human trafficking could be considered money laundering . 
[PER Salgado  ] believed the database could be used in searches for proceeds from human trafficking and thought language was included in the draft law that would allow this . 
( [ORG Comment:  ] The Vice President did not appear certain . 
) //MEETING WITH INTERIOR MINISTER RUBALCABA// <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Secretary [PER Napolitano  ] stated that the [ORG USG  ] was interested in working with [LOC Spain  ] to negotiate an agreement on data privacy that could lead to a [MISC US-EU  ] information-sharing accord signed during [LOC Spain  ] 's 2010 [ORG EU Presidency  ] . 
[PER Rubalcaba  ] said for years there has been interest within the [ORG EU  ] in doing this , but that the early 2009 [MISC Czech  ] Presidency " basically wasted six months . 
" [PER Rubalcaba  ] suggested that he would talk to his counterpart in [LOC Sweden  ] , which took the [ORG EU  ] late 2009 Presidency that day , to coordinate with [LOC Stockholm  ] the relaunch [MISC US-EU  ] talks during the [MISC Swedish  ] Presidency in hopes that negotiations could conclude either during the [MISC Swedish  ] or the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG EU  ] Presidencies . 
[PER Rubalcaba  ] appeared supportive of reaching an agreement , but cautioned that cumbersome [ORG EU  ] red tape - and the need for consensus among the 27 member-states before the bloc negotiates with the [ORG USG  ] - would make this timeline difficult to achieve. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The Secretary offered to work with the [ORG Department of State  ] to supply a [ORG DHS  ] official - for a six- to nine-month tour in anticipation of and during the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG EU  ] Presidency - to work in [PER Rubalcaba  ] 's Ministry to address these [MISC U.S.-EU  ] issues and to strengthen bilateral efforts to combat terrorism , human trafficking , and drug smuggling . 
The Minister said he was delighted the Secretary accepted the proposal he had made during his visit to [LOC Washington  ] the previous week and said that a similar program with a [MISC German  ] [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] official had been enormously productive for [LOC Spain  ] . 
The Minister suggested the sooner this could be arranged , the better , but he also went out of his way that the [ORG GOS  ] was not looking for anyone to supplant the role of the ICE Attache office in [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Embassy Madrid  ] and emphasized that the workload would be different . 
[PER Rubalcaba  ] also made a pitch for two or three [ORG Civil Guard  ] officials to travel to the [LOC United States  ] for a briefing on how the [ORG U.S. Coast Guard  ] operates . 
The Secretary replied she would be more than happy to have [ORG DHS  ] work with the [MISC Spanish  ] on this. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The Secretary and [PER Rubalcaba  ] also signed a declaration of principles to formalize the presence of three [ORG CBP  ] officers who have been working at [LOC Madrid  ] 's [LOC Barajas Airport  ] as part of the [ORG Department 's Immigration Advisory Program  ] ( [ORG IAP  ] ) . 
The accord allows [ORG IAP  ] to continue operations following a successful pilot . 
During a joint press conference following the signing of the agreement , [PER Rubalcaba  ] said that the [ORG GOS  ] did not rule out the possibility that the program could be expanded to other [MISC Spanish  ] airports. //MEETING WITH JUSTICE MINISTER CAAMANO// <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Caamano  ] informed the Secretary that the [ORG GOS  ] - during its [ORG EU  ] presidency - was planning to revitalize the transatlantic agenda . 
He said he was aware of some [ORG USG  ] concerns about the [ORG EU  ] position on data protection and explained that the [ORG EU  ] was looking for a balance of privacy guarantees and security concerns . 
The Secretary agreed with the initiative to promote cooperation between both the [ORG USG  ] and [ORG GOS  ] and the [ORG USG  ] and the [ORG EU  ] . 
She added that there was a lot of information that could and should be shared . 
She suggested that there must be a way to strike the balance the Minister had described and told [PER Caamano  ] that she had offered to provide a [ORG DHS  ] official on TDY to the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] to help resolve this and other issues . 
Asked whether combating cybercrime and promoting cybersecurity would be included in [LOC Spain  ] 's transatlantic agenda initiative , the Minister replied that that he thought that it would . 
The Secretary encouraged this to be a priority item and highlighted that these types of crimes do not respect national boundaries . 
[PER Caamano  ] said the [ORG EU  ] had been working on some framework decisions to allow member-states to be more effective in combating cybercrime and indicated that perhaps regulatory reforms could be established to close down servers that systematically violate intellectual property rights. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The Secretary inquired as to the status of [LOC Spain  ] 's " universal jurisdiction " doctrine , to which [PER Caamano  ] replied that the practical application of universal jurisdiction - which is very popular in [LOC Spain  ] - had caused problems for the [ORG GOS  ] with other democratic countries . 
The Minister explained how the lower house of the [MISC Spanish  ] parliament recently had passed a bill which would prevent [LOC Spain  ] from becoming " the guardian of the world . 
" He elaborated that the reform - which still had not received approval from the [ORG Senate  ] - would establish that the [MISC Spanish  ] judiciary could not open a case involving crimes against humanity if another country already had begun its own investigation . 
Also , the reform would establish that there must be a link between the crime and [MISC Spanish  ] interests , such as an incident involving [MISC Spanish  ] citizens . 
The Minister pointed out that the [ORG National Court  ] had recently dismissed a [MISC Spanish  ] " universal jurisdiction " case involving [MISC Israeli  ] bombardment of the [LOC Gaza Strip  ] in 2002 after [LOC Israel  ] opened its own investigation into the matter. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG DHS  ] delegation has cleared this cable .
