End Summary . 
Domestic Overview ------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [LOC Pakistan  ] continues to face extraordinary challenges on the security and law enforcement front . 
The country has suffered greater military , law enforcement , and civilian casualties in fighting extremism and terrorism than almost any other country . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] 's military is currently engaged in combat operations against militant groups in the [ORG Malakand Division of North West Frontier Province  ] ( [ORG NFWP  ] ) and six of the seven agencies of the [LOC Federally Administered Tribal Areas  ] ( [LOC FATA  ] ) along the [MISC Pak-Afghan  ] border . 
At the same time , [LOC Pakistan  ] has experienced an alarming increase in terrorist attacks against government and civilian targets in [LOC Pakistan  ] 's major cities , resulting in several hundred deaths in recent months . 
In your meetings , you should acknowledge the sacrifices made by [LOC Pakistan  ] 's law enforcement agencies and the pressure the terrorist attacks have placed on their resources. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In the midst of this difficult security situation , [LOC Pakistan  ] 's civilian government remains weak , ineffectual , and corrupt . 
Domestic politics is dominated by uncertainty about the fate of President [PER Zardari  ] . 
He enjoys approval ratings in the 20 percent range and has repeatedly clashed with key power centers , including the military , politically ambitious [ORG Supreme Court Chief Justice  ] [PER Iftikhar Chaudhry  ] , and opposition leader [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] . 
In December , the [ORG Supreme Court  ] ruled unconstitutional the November 2007 [ORG National Reconciliation Ordinance  ] , promulgated by then-President [PER Musharraf  ] , which provided legal amnesty for [PER Benazir Bhutto  ] , [PER Zardari  ] , and key figures in their party , enabling them to participate in 2008 elections . 
The [ORG Court  ] 's ruling has paved the way for a revival of corruption cases against a number of officials , including Interior Minister [PER Rehman Malik  ] . 
Whether corruption cases can be revived against [PER Zardari  ] himself is less certain , as [LOC Pakistan  ] 's constitution includes a clause providing sitting presidents with criminal immunity. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) While we have had major successes in our military and law enforcement cooperation with [LOC Pakistan  ] , cooperation has frequently been hampered by suspicion in [LOC Pakistan  ] 's military and intelligence establishment about [LOC U.S.  ] intentions and objectives . 
Among other things , the [MISC Pakistanis  ] believe that we have favored [LOC India  ] over [LOC Pakistan  ] -- most notably , by approving civil-nuclear cooperation with [LOC India  ] -- and that we aim to dismantle [LOC Pakistan  ] 's nuclear weapons program , which , in light of their conventional military disadvantage vis-a-vis [LOC India  ] , they consider critical to their national security . 
The military and intelligence establishment is also concerned that we are working with [LOC Pakistan  ] 's civilian leadership to limit the military 's prerogative in determining [LOC Pakistan  ] 's national security policies . 
As a result of these concerns , the military and intelligence establishment has taken steps since Spring 2009 to hamper the operations of the [ORG ISLAMABAD  ] 00000416 002 OF 004 [MISC Embassy  ] . 
These steps include holding up the issuance and renewal of [MISC Pakistani  ] visas for permanent [MISC Embassy  ] staff and TDYers ; denying import permits for armored vehicles for [MISC Embassy  ] use ; sabotaging our contract with [ORG DynCorp International  ] to provide enhanced protective support for Consulate General [LOC Peshawar  ] personnel ; slowing down importation of [LOC U.S.  ] assistance for the [MISC Pakistani  ] government , including equipment for [MISC Pakistani  ] law enforcement agencies ; shutting down our [ORG Anti-Terrorism Assistance  ] ( [ORG ATA  ] ) training program at [LOC Pakistan  ] 's [ORG Sihala Police Academy  ] ; putting up roadblocks for our acquiring additional land for the [MISC Embassy  ] 's expansion ; and harassing [MISC Embassy  ] personnel by stopping and detaining [MISC Embassy  ] vehicles . 
Some of these problems have recently abated in response to our repeatedly raising them with the highest levels of the [MISC Pakistani  ] government . 
However , we expect we will have to continue to push back against such impediments for the foreseeable future . 
[ORG Federal Investigation Agency  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [ORG FBI  ] 's primary [MISC Pakistani  ] counterpart is the [ORG Federal Investigation Agency  ] ( [ORG FIA  ] ) . 
On December 7 , the government replaced [ORG FIA  ] Director General [PER Tariq Khosa  ] with [PER Zafarullah Khan  ] . 
While [PER Khosa  ] was ostensibly given a promotion by being named Secretary of the [ORG Ministry of Narcotics Control  ] , a number of press reports maintained that [PER Khosa  ] was removed from his [ORG FIA  ] position for his aggressive pursuit of corruption cases against government officials and businessmen . 
[PER Khosa  ] had developed close cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] on a host of law enforcement issues , including on the [LOC Mumbai  ] case . 
While [PER Khan  ] has a strong law enforcement background , he has not shown an inclination to be as forward-leaning on cooperation as [PER Khosa  ] was . 
Counter-Terrorism Finance ------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) In the past year , [LOC Pakistan  ] has made steady progress in combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism . 
Earlier this year , the [ORG FIA  ] partnered with the [ORG State Bank of Pakistan  ] to crack down on large licensed and unlicensed money service businesses that were violating foreign exchange laws and contributing to money laundering . 
In January , the [ORG National Assembly  ] passed new [PER Anti-Money Laundering  ] ( [ORG AML  ] ) legislation ; the bill is currently awaiting [ORG Senate  ] action . 
In the interim , the legislation is in force through its promulgation as an ordnance signed by President [PER Zardari  ] . 
Separately , during a February 12 meeting in [LOC Islamabad  ] , Assistant Treasury Secretary [PER David Cohen  ] provided the [MISC Pakistanis  ] with a compilation of tearline information on the financial activities of terrorist organizations in [LOC Pakistan  ] -- including their use of the formal financial sector -- and affiliated charities , businesses , and individuals . 
[PER Cohen  ] encouraged the [MISC Pakistanis  ] to exploit these leads in the pursuit of additional inform ation to identify key terrorism donors , fundraisers , and financial facilitators . 
[PER Cohen  ] also passed declassified terrorism finance information to four [MISC Pakistani  ] banks . 
[ORG Law Enforcement Assistance  ] -------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Pakistan  ] 's terrorism threats necessitate substantial strengthening of the country 's law enforcement capabilities . 
The [ORG State Department 's International Narcotics  ] and [ORG Law Enforcement  ] ( [ORG INL  ] ) [ORG Bureau  ] is providing significant training , equipment , and infrastructure assistance to the police in [LOC North West Frontier Province  ] ( [ORG NWFP  ] ) , i.e. , the province most affected by terrorist attacks . 
This assistance -- $40.5 million in [LOC FY2009  ] and $34.6 million in [LOC FY2010  ] -- focuses on the [ORG NWFP  ] police 's [ORG Elite Force  ] , a " heavy " police force with [MISC SWAT-like  ] capabilities established in 2008 . 
Equipment we are providing the [ORG Elite Force  ] includes vehicles , armored personnel carriers , protective vests , night vision goggles , and communications gear . 
We are hardening police checkpoints with [MISC Hesco-like  ] barriers and are rebuilding three police [ORG ISLAMABAD  ] 00000416 003 OF 004 stations in [ORG NWFP  ] 's [ORG Malakand Division  ] that were destroyed by militants . 
[ORG INL  ] is also funding a variety of police training courses implemented by the [ORG Department of Justice  ] 's [ORG ICITAP  ] program that are open to nationwide participation. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The [ORG Department of State 's Anti-Terrorism Assistance  ] ( [ORG ATA  ] ) program has separate activities aimed at enhancing the counter-terrorism capabilities of [LOC Pakistan  ] 's law enforcement agencies . 
A key component of the [ORG ATA  ] program is focused on " hard skills " tactical training , including explosives detection and disposal , quick reaction , and VIP protection . 
Unfortunately , the [ORG ATA  ] program is now under threat of termination . 
Following false press reports that our [ORG ATA  ] trainers are using the training center provided by the [MISC Pakistani  ] government , i.e. , the [ORG Sihala Police Academy  ] , for nefarious purposes -- including to gather information on a nearby [LOC Pakistan  ] nuclear installation -- the government has decided to end our use of that facility and has not yet provided an acceptable alternative site . 
[LOC Mumbai  ] Case ----------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [LOC Pakistan  ] 's prosecution of the seven suspects it arrested in the [LOC Mumbai  ] case -- i.e. , [PER Lashkar-e-Tayiba  ] ( LeT ) operatives [PER Zakiur Rehman Lahkvi  ] , [PER Zarrar Shah  ] , [LOC Al-Qama  ] , [PER Shahid Jamil Riaz  ] , and [PER Hammad Amin Saqid  ] , and terrorism financiers [PER Jamil Ahmed  ] and [PER Younos Anjum  ] -- is proceeding , though at a slow pace . 
The defense lawyers have aggressively filed motions challenging varying aspects of the case . 
On November 25 , an [ORG Anti-Terrorism Court  ] finally framed the charges against the seven defendants , allowing the court proceedings , which are being held in camera , to move to the trial phase . 
Four [ORG FBI  ] expert witnesses are expected to be called to testify for the prosecution . 
The government has continually reassured us that the prosecutors will win convictions against all the defendants after a trial lasting several months , though it has a stronger case against the five LeT operatives than against the two terrorism financers . 
There are concerns that some of the convictions could be overturned at the appellate level , where the courts set an extremely high evidentiary bar . 
On October 12 , a [MISC Pakistani  ] court quashed all remaining cases against [PER Hafiz Saeed  ] , the head of LeT alias [PER Jama'at-ud-Dawa  ] ( JuD ) . 
Those cases were not related to the [LOC Mumbai  ] attack . 
The government has repeatedly told us that it would need much more evidence of [PER Saeed  ] 's direct involvement in the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks to move forward with [MISC Mumbai-related  ] charges against him . 
[PER David Coleman Headley  ] --------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S ) In December , an [MISC FBI-DOJ  ] team briefed [MISC Pakistani  ] officials from the [ORG ISI  ] , [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] , [ORG FIA  ] , [ORG IB  ] , and [ORG MFA  ] on the [PER David Coleman Headley  ] investigation , providing them with tear-line information on [PER Headley  ] 's statements to [LOC U.S.  ] authorities . 
[ORG ISI  ] officials said they had very little information to identify the [MISC Pakistanis  ] mentioned in the statements . 
They discussed their investigation into [ORG First World Immigration Service  ] , a business front used by [PER Headley  ] and his co-conspirators . 
The [ORG ISI  ] said while they would not grant direct [ORG FBI  ] access to co-conspirator Major ( retd . 
) [PER Abdurrehman Syed  ] , who was in [ORG ISI  ] custody , the [ORG FBI  ] could submit questions for [PER Syed  ] through the [ORG ISI  ] . 
The [ORG FIA  ] and [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] informed the [ORG FBI  ] that it would be difficult to introduce [MISC Headley-related  ] evidence in the government 's prosecution of the [LOC Mumbai  ] defendants , including because [PER Headley  ] 's statements to [LOC U.S.  ] authorities would be treated as hearsay with little evidentiary value in court . 
[LOC Sargodha  ] Five ------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The [MISC Pakistanis  ] continue to pursue their own case against the five [MISC American  ] citizens from [LOC Northern Virginia  ] who were arrested in [LOC Sargodha  ] , [LOC Punjab  ] province , on December 8 , following suspicions they had travelled to [LOC Pakistan  ] to engage [ORG ISLAMABAD  ] 00000416 004 OF 004 in jihadist activities . 
They have not acted on our request that the five be returned to the [LOC United States  ] . 
The [MISC Pakistani  ] prosecutor has repeatedly asked for continuations in the case because he is not yet prepared to move forward with charges . 
The five suspects , who claim to have been abused while in custody , were denied bail at a February 16 court hearing . 
The next hearing will take place sometime in March . 
[PER Aafia Siddiqui  ] -------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) There has been widespread condemnation here of the February 3 guilty verdict against Dr. [PER Aafia Siddiqui  ] , a [MISC Pakistani  ] citizen who was tried in [ORG Federal Court  ] in [LOC New York  ] on charges of attempting to murder [LOC U.S.  ] soldiers and law enforcement authorities in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Many [MISC Pakistanis  ] were taken by surprise by the verdict because one-sided [MISC Pakistani  ] media coverage of the case reported only on her defense and not the prosecution 's case , leading local observers to conclude her acquittal was a near certainty . 
We have stressed to the [MISC Pakistanis  ] that [PER Siddiqui  ] received a fair trial and has a right to an appeal . 
A number of our [MISC Pakistani  ] interlocutors have suggested that President [PER Obama  ] consider pardoning [PER Siddiqui  ] , and Prime Minister [PER Gilani  ] told Senator [PER Kerry  ] on February 16 that [PER Siddiqui  ] should be transferred to [LOC Pakistan  ] to serve out her sentence here .
