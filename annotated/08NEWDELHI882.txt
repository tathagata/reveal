( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY: [LOC Tibet  ] remains a front-burner challenge in [LOC New Delhi  ] more than 10 days after protests at the [MISC Chinese  ] [ORG Embassy  ] and a protest march out of [LOC Dharamsala  ] led to the arrest of over 200 [MISC Tibetans  ] . 
After another protest at the [MISC Chinese  ] [ORG Embassy  ] led to more arrests on March 21 , the [MISC Indian  ] press reported that [MISC Chinese  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] warnings led the [MISC Indian  ] government to back out of a “tentative” meeting between Vice-President [MISC Ansari  ] and the [ORG Dalai Lama  ] . 
The [ORG BJP  ] and RSS smell blood as a result of the government’s caution , while the normally meddlesome Left has kept a stony silence on [MISC China’s  ] actions in [LOC Tibet  ] . 
[MISC Tibetan  ] sources report that 70 of 140 protesters arrested in [LOC Delhi  ] remain in detention as of March 26 , despite an assurance from Foreign Secretary [PER Menon  ] to the Ambassador on March 19 that all those arrested before then would be released that day . 
The [ORG Dalai Lama’s Special Envoy  ] told [ORG Poloff  ] that the [MISC Tibetan  ] [ORG Government-in-Exile  ] was satisfied with the [MISC Indian  ] government’s statements to date on the situation , and suggested that the USG positively acknowledge India’s statement rather than press the [ORG GOI  ] to be more forceful . 
He said that he hoped that President [PER Bush  ] will issue a statement “sooner rather than later , ” and added that the [ORG Dalai Lama  ] had sent a personal letter to [MISC Chinese  ] President [PER Hu Jintao  ] . 
Responding to criticism that the [LOC U.S.  ] was applying pressure , External Affairs Minister [PER Mukherjee  ] said “They ( the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) have expressed their views . 
They are not putting pressure ( on [LOC India  ] ) .” [LOC India  ] continues to walk the razor’s edge between [LOC Beijing  ] and [LOC Dharamsala  ] . 
It cannot afford to antagonize the former , but it has a sacred obligation to the latter . 
END SUMMARY ----- Protesters scale perimeter wall at [MISC Chinese  ] [ORG Embassy  ] ----- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Five members of a group of [MISC Tibetan  ] demonstrators breached the perimeter wall of the [MISC Chinese  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC New Delhi  ] on the night of March 21 . 
The report said that the five protesters were detained along with thirty-three others before any untoward incidents occurred . 
The [ORG Dalai Lama’s Representative  ] in [LOC New Delhi  ] , [PER Tempa Tsering  ] , told [ORG Poloff  ] on March 26 that seventy of the 140 [MISC Tibetans  ] held in [LOC Delhi  ] since March 14 have been released to date , noting that several of the March 21 protesters were injured . 
According to “The [MISC Indian  ] Express , ” the [MISC Chinese  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] summoned Ambassador [PER Rao  ] in [LOC Beijing  ] to voice their concern for the safety and security of its diplomatic personnel in [LOC Delhi  ] and handed over a list of [MISC Tibetan  ] protests likely to take place in [LOC India  ] prior to the [MISC Olympics  ] , which the [MISC Chinese  ] asked [LOC India  ] to act upon. “The [ORG Hindustan Times”  ] quoted the [MISC Chinese  ] Ambassador to [LOC India  ] Zhang Yan as saying , “I hope [MISC Indian  ] friends see through the nature of his ( the [PER Dalai Lama’s  ] ) intentions and not be misled and make correct statements based on facts and deeds , not words.” Zhang added that , “He ( the [ORG Dalai Lama  ] ) used non-violence to cheat the international community.” ----- [MISC Indian  ] Vice-President not to meet with [ORG Dalai Lama  ] ----- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) “The [MISC Indian  ] Express” citQsources in a March 22 report as stating that Vice-President [PER Hamid Ansari’s  ] meeting with the [ORG Dalai Lama  ] , scheduled two months previously , was canceled after [MISC Chinese  ] pressure precipitated the [ORG GOI  ] to advise [PER Ansari’s  ] office to cancel the meeting , although the news item quoted [ORG GOI  ] sources as saying that the meeting was “only tentatively scheduled.” Referring to the [PER Dalai Lama-Ansari  ] meeting , the “Zee News” portal quoted [MISC Chinese  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] Spokesman [PER Qin Gang  ] as declaring that , “The [MISC Indian  ] side has clarified to [LOC China  ] on the relevant rumor , saying that there is no such plan.” ----- [MISC Tibetan  ] government-in-exile satisfied with [ORG GOI  ] statements ----- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Special Envoy of His Holiness the [ORG Dalai Lama Lodi  ] [PER Gyaltsen Gyari  ] expressed satisfaction with [ORG GOI  ] official statements to date , noting that “They have their own understandable compulsions , and it’s better than the past when no statements were issued.” He expressed his belief that it would be beneficial for the USG to positively acknowledge India’s March 15 statement that , “We are [LOC NEW DELHI  ] 00000882 002 OF 002 distressed by reports of the unsettled situation and violence in [LOC Lhasa  ] , and by the deaths of innocent people . 
We would hope that all those involved will work to improve the situation and remove the causes of such trouble in [LOC Tibet  ] , which is an autonomous region of [LOC China  ] , through dialogue and non-violent means.” [PER Gyari  ] speculated that positive reinforcement may motivate the [ORG GOI  ] to issue further statements in support of the [MISC Tibetans  ] . 
He revealed that a private communication from the [ORG Dalai Lama  ] to [MISC Chinese  ] President [PER Hu Jintao  ] was received by the [MISC Chinese  ] on 20 March , and the [MISC Tibetan  ] government-in-exile was waiting for a response . 
[PER Gyari  ] stated that he had shared the letter with Undersecretary [PER Dobriansky  ] , contacts at the [ORG NSC  ] , and [MISC Indian  ] Foreign Secretary [PER ShivShankar Menon  ] . 
He commented that he planned to meet with [ORG Indian National Security Adviser  ] [PER M.K. Narayanan  ] on 24 March but did not disclose the agenda for the discussion . 
[PER Gyari  ] opined that a statement from President [PER Bush  ] would give the [MISC Chinese  ] reason for pause and emphasized that , if forthcoming , the statement would be “most beneficial sooner rather than later.” ----- [ORG BJP  ] blames [PER Nehru  ] for current [LOC Tibet  ] morass ----- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Tibet  ] has become a domestic political issue again in recent days , as posturing for the upcoming general elections continues . 
On March 25 , India’s Zee New portal reported that the [ORG Bharatiya Janata Party  ] prime ministerial candidate [PER L.K. Advani  ] blamed former [ORG Congress  ] Prime Minister [PER Jawaharlal Nehru  ] for adopting a “weak stance” on [LOC Tibet  ] in the 1950s , stating that , “the [PER Nehru  ] government’s failure to focus on India’s diplomatic efforts , while simultaneously strengthening its military capabilities , to deftly resolve the boundary issue with [LOC China  ] , ” directly contributed to the current state of affairs in [LOC Tibet  ] . 
He hailed the [ORG BJP’s Vajpayee  ] administration as engineers of the current progress in [LOC India-China  ] relations , adding that he urged [MISC Chinese  ] President [PER Hu  ] during his November 2006 [LOC India  ] visit to arrange for the [ORG Dalai Lama  ] to visit [LOC Tibet  ] prior to the 2008 [LOC Beijing  ] [MISC Olympics  ] . 
Assailing the [ORG Congress  ] Party’s passive reaction to [MISC China’s  ] repression in [LOC Tibet  ] , [ORG Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh  ] ( [ORG RSS  ] ) Chief [PER K.S. Sudershan  ] condemned the “atrocities perpetrated on the peaceful protesters” in [LOC Tibet  ] and proclaimed that , “these demonstrations have completely betrayed the hollowness of [MISC Chinese  ] claims that under her occupation [LOC Tibet  ] has witnessed all-around development and that the people are happy with the regime.” Broadsiding the [ORG Congress Party  ] , [PER Sudershan  ] pledged the [MISC RSS’s  ] full support for the [MISC Tibetan  ] cause and urged the world to “exert such pressure over the Government of [LOC China  ] that it is forced to come to the negotiating table to find a peaceful solution to the [MISC Tibetan  ] crisis.” Meanwhile , the Left , ready at all times to comment negatively on anything relating to [LOC America  ] , remains absolutely silent on the [LOC Tibet  ] issue , preferring to stand by [MISC CPI-M  ] leader [PER Sitaram Yechury’s  ] hypocritical March 17 statement that the [MISC CPI-M  ] was unable to comment as [LOC Tibet  ] was an “internal matter” for [LOC China.  ] ----- [LOC India  ] keeps a finger to the wind ----- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) COMMENT: The words “tightrope” and “balancing act” are constantly repeated in [LOC Delhi  ] regarding the [MISC Indian  ] government’s handling of [MISC Tibetan  ] protests . 
As Foreign Secretary [PER Menon  ] explained to the Ambassador , the [MISC Tibetan  ] SIPDIS movement has the sympathy of the [MISC Indian  ] public , and [LOC India  ] has been a generally supportive home to tens of thousands of [MISC Tibetans  ] , including the [ORG Dalai Lama  ] , for nearly 50 years . 
However , the tacit agreement that [MISC Tibetans  ] are welcome in [LOC India  ] as long as they don’t cause problems is being challenged at a time when India’s complex relationship with [LOC Beijing  ] is churning with border issues , rivalry for regional influence , a growing economic interdependence , the nascent stages of joint military exercises , and numerous other priorities . 
While the [ORG GOI  ] will never admit it , we expect New [MISC Delhi’s Balancing Act  ] with India’s [MISC Tibetans  ] to continue for the foreseeable future , with the caveat that a rise in violence -- either by [MISC Tibetans  ] here or by the [MISC Chinese  ] security forces in [LOC Tibet  ] - could quickly tip the balance in favor of the side with greater public support .
