End Summary . 
HELP US HELP YOU: END THE ATTACKS ---------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) PDAS [PER Kelly  ] told Ambassador [PER Guzman  ] ( who was accompanied by [MISC Bolivian  ] DCM [PER Raul Barrios  ] , First Secretary [PER Davalos  ] , and First Secretary [PER Ayllon  ] ) that the [ORG USG  ] wanted an open and positive relationship with [LOC Bolivia  ] and was committed to helping [LOC Bolivia  ] address poverty and counternarcotics challenges ; however , the tone and frequency of the [ORG GOB  ] , s political rhetoric and attacks against the [ORG USG  ] caused us serious concern . 
[PER Kelly  ] said the baseless attacks against [ORG USAID  ] and allegations of a [ORG USG  ] conspiracy against the [ORG GOB  ] were counterproductive and made it difficult to sustain positive will . 
Actions have consequences , [PER Kelly  ] admonished , and the [ORG GOB  ] , s actions threatened [ORG MCC  ] , [ORG ATPA  ] , and future [ORG AID  ] programs . 
[PER Kelly  ] specifically noted [ORG MCC  ] President [PER Danilovich  ] , s and other high level officials , negative reaction to the [ORG GOB  ] , s attacks against the [MISC USG.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Kelly  ] also said that the personal attacks against Ambassador [PER Goldberg  ] , who enjoys an excellent reputation throughout the [ORG USG  ] , must stop immediately . 
Recent accusations that Ambassador [PER Goldberg  ] was working with [MISC Colombian  ] paramilitaries were not only groundless and offensive but also made light of the [ORG USG  ] 's support for the Government of [LOC Colombia  ] 's success in reining in illegal armed groups and our overall policy against narcoterrorism . 
Department hopes [ORG EU  ] members resident in [LOC La Paz  ] will support our appeal for calmer rhetoric ; details to follow via septel . 
DON'T PICK ON EVO , HE'S JUST A COCALERO --------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Guzman  ] assured PDAS [PER Kelly  ] that he would convey [ORG USG  ] concerns to President [PER Morales  ] via the [ORG MFA  ] and expressed his commitment to overcoming these challenges . 
He attempted to explain away [PER Morales  ] , behavior , recalling [LOC Bolivia  ] 's conflictive history , [PER Morales  ] , indigenous background and cocalero base of support , and the [MISC Bolivian  ] President 's belief that [MISC Bolivian  ] elites and one former [ORG USG  ] ambassador in particular had worked actively to undermine him . 
[PER Guzman  ] said that [PER Morales  ] , rhetoric played to his cocalero constituency which viewed him as their champion against imperialism . 
His campaign for social inclusion represented an important democratic movement not only for [LOC Bolivia  ] , [PER Guzman  ] stressed , but for all of [LOC Latin America  ] -- particularly the heretofore excluded indigenous population . 
PDAS [PER Kelly  ] interjected that the [ORG USG  ] shared [PER Morales  ] , vision for eradicating poverty and social inclusion ; however , it was offensive and unacceptable to seek to portray the [LOC U.S.  ] , which was an important ally of [LOC Bolivia  ] 's in this regard , as imperialist. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Guzman  ] said his objective was to build trust and confidence between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Bolivia  ] and agreed that bilateral disagreements should be resolved privately through diplomatic channels , not in the press . 
He lamented the lack of coordination between [LOC Bolivia  ] 's [ORG MFA  ] and office of the Presidency , and said that FM Choquehuanca continued to promote a one-on-one breakfast for [PER Morales  ] and Ambassador [PER Goldberg  ] to help resolve outstanding differences and put the bilateral relationship on a more solid footing . 
[ORG GOB  ] RADAR: TRADE , DRUGS , AND THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY STATE 00156011 002 OF 002 --------------------------------------------- ----------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Guzman  ] said that like [LOC Peru  ] and [LOC Colombia  ] , [LOC Bolivia  ] sought an open commercial relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] ; to that end , Minister of [ORG Economic Development Cecilia Sosa  ] was planning to visit [LOC Washington  ] to lobby for an extension of [LOC Bolivia  ] 's [ORG ATPA  ] benefits and would request appropriate appointments in the Department . 
Regarding pending removal proceedings for [MISC Bolivian  ] drug trafficker [PER Arce Gomez  ] , [PER Guzman  ] reiterated his request that the Department support efforts to prevent [PER Arce Gomez  ] from being deported to a third country instead of [LOC Bolivia  ] when he completed his jail sentence . 
[PER Kelly  ] said this was a [ORG DHS  ] matter and promised the Office of [MISC Andean  ] affairs would continue to facilitate the [MISC Bolivian  ] embassy 's contacts with the appropriate [ORG USG  ] officials . 
In closing , [PER Guzman  ] offered his thoughts on [LOC Bolivia  ] 's troubled [ORG Constituent Assembly  ] , noting that its probable demise would represent a major failure for the opposition as well as the [ORG GOB  ] . 
He predicted that if the [ORG Constituent Assembly  ] did not succeed , [PER Morales  ] would likely put the issues under consideration directly to the people in a referendum .
