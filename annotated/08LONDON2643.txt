End Summary . 
[ORG HMG Policy Paper  ] on [LOC Russia  ] -------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Davenport  ] explained that [ORG HMG  ] was conducting “parallel exercises” involving Cabinet , Intelligence and [ORG Foreign Office  ] principals , designed to give PM Brown a clearer picture of [MISC Russian  ] foreign policy making processes and recommendations for dealing with [LOC Moscow  ] . 
He confessed that “volumes had been produced” in the exercise , but that the [ORG Foreign Office  ] contribution had been winnowed down to a single draft which had been passed for review to [PER FS Miliband  ] and other Cabinet ministers the week of October 13. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In previewing that text , [PER Davenport  ] explained that the paper included the results of an internal [ORG HMG  ] debate over whether there had been a “strategic shift” in [MISC Russian  ] foreign policy The process of producing the paper revealed some internal divides within [ORG HMG  ] , particularly as to whether a posture of [MISC Cold War  ] type “containment” should be employed to counter Moscow’s more aggressive stance recently . 
Those more familiar with [MISC Russian  ] policy in [ORG HMG  ] were able , according to [PER Davenport  ] , to show the inappropriateness of such a tactic given the more integrated [MISC Russian  ] international presence compared to 20 years ago , particularly in the worldwide economy . 
Hard-Headed Engagement ---------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [LOC UK  ] sees recent [MISC Russian  ] foreign policy actions as a “continuum” in Moscow’s goal to maintain influence in its near abroad and to deter western influence , especially [ORG NATO  ] enlargement . 
The [LOC UK  ] therefore reads the military action in [LOC Georgia  ] as part of a pattern - exemplified by recent [MISC Russian  ] policy on [LOC CFE  ] , [ORG Missile Defense  ] and other multilateral initiatives - in implementation of the same strategy . 
[PER Davenport  ] views the tactics employed by [LOC Moscow  ] in that regard as “hit and miss , ” leading to an opportunistic approach , as opposed to a coordinated planning process in the [LOC Kremlin  ] . 
He cites [MISC Russia’s  ] recognition of [LOC South Ossetian  ] and [MISC Abkhazian  ] independence as “tactical ad-hocery” which many in [LOC Moscow  ] might now regret given the lack of support for recognition even from [MISC Russia’s  ] close friends. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Looking ahead , [PER Davenport  ] predicts [LOC Russia  ] will use all available levers to pursue its goals . 
It will prefer employing political , economic , social and intelligence methods and resources , but [LOC Georgia  ] has shown that military means are part of the [LOC Kremlin’s  ] tactical lexicon . 
The [ORG FCO  ] paper will therefore identify areas of “joint advantage” to focus [LOC UK  ] and multilateral cooperation with [LOC Russia  ] , particularly in the energy and commercial sectors . 
According to [PER Davenport  ] , the [LOC UK  ] proposes a “hard-headed , robust when necessary , ” engagement with [LOC Russia  ] , coordinated among [ORG NATO  ] and [ORG EU  ] allies , to include dialogue and cooperation where possible so as not to isolate [LOC Moscow  ] . 
[PER Davenport  ] noted that FM [PER Miliband  ] has invited [MISC Russian  ] FM Lavrov to visit [LOC London  ] at a mutually convenient time . 
A More [MISC Resilient Approach  ] ------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) As examples of this more “resilient” approach , [PER Davenport  ] cites the need for deeper transatlantic engagement with former [MISC Soviet  ] states to support their [MISC European  ] aspirations without challenging [LOC Russia  ] ; a coherent [ORG NATO  ] policy towards [LOC Georgia  ] and [LOC Ukraine  ] to advance [LOC Bucharest Summit  ] goals ; and a more comprehensive [MISC European  ] energy policy , to include alternate sources , improved efficiency , and supply diversity as means of countering [MISC Russian  ] influence . 
Some Kremlinology ----------------- [LOC LONDON  ] 00002643 002 OF 002 <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Within [LOC Russia  ] , [PER Davenport  ] underlines that there has been “radical” change in the political and economic landscape over the past 15 years . 
While the political system is best described as a corrupt autocracy , it is a confident one . 
The economy is stronger and more vibrant with a far broader industrial base . 
The [MISC Putin/Medvedev  ] relationship is also evolving , with both showing assertiveness during the [LOC Georgia  ] conflict . 
[ORG HMG  ] , s view is that [PER Putin  ] still holds the reins , particularly on Ukraine-related issues , but allows [PER Medvedev  ] to control events once broad policy has been agreed. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Comment: The broad and high level engagement in this exercise across [ORG HMG  ] is an indication of the seriousness with which PM Brown and his close advisors are treating [MISC Russian  ] relations . 
The [LOC UK  ] has had more experience lately than most western [MISC European  ] countries with Moscow’s ire , going back to the [MISC Litvinenko  ] poisoning case and continuing through the tit-for -tat diplomatic expulsions and closure of a number of [ORG British Council  ] offices in [LOC Russia  ] . 
The [LOC UK  ] , through the stock taking and forward looking elements which will be contained within this paper , is clearly trying to put relations back on the right track bilaterally while ensuring [LOC Moscow  ] understands the consequences of its foreign policy .
