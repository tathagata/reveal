<code><pre>S E C R E T ISLAMABAD 002185 NOFORN EO 12958 DECL: 09/07/2034 TAGS PGOV , PHUM , PTER , MOPS , MASS , KJUS , PK SUBJECT: ADDRESSING CONCERNS ABOUT [LOC PAKISTAN  ] SECURITY FORCES’ [ORG HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES REF: ISLAMABAD  ] 2074 Classified By: Derived from [LOC DSCG  ] 05-01 , b and d <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) A growing body of evidence is lending credence to allegations of human rights abuses by [LOC Pakistan  ] security forces during domestic operations against terrorists in [ORG Malakand Division  ] and the [LOC Federally Administered Tribal Areas  ] . 
While it is oftentimes difficult to attribute with accuracy any responsibility for such abuses , reporting from a variety of sources suggests that [ORG Frontier Corps  ] and regular [ORG Pakistan Army  ] units involved in direct combat with terrorists may have been involved . 
The crux of the problem appears to center on the treatment of terrorists detained in battlefield operations and have focused on the extra-judicial killing of some detainees . 
The detainees involved were in the custody of [ORG Frontier Corps  ] or [ORG Pakistan Army  ] units . 
The allegations of extra-judicial killings generally do not/not extend to what are locally referred to as “the disappeared” -- high-value terrorist suspects and domestic insurgents who are being held incommunicado by [MISC Pakistani  ] intelligence agencies including the [ORG Inter-Services Intelligence Division  ] ( [ORG ISI  ] ) and [ORG Military Intelligence  ] ( [ORG MI  ] ) in their facilities. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Revenge for terrorist attacks on [ORG Pakistan Army  ] and [ORG Frontier Corps  ] personnel is believed to be one of the primary motivating factors for the extra-judicial killings . 
Cultural traditions place a strong importance on such revenge killings , which are seen as key to maintaining a unit’s honor . 
Senior military commanders have equally and repeatedly stressed their concerns that the court’s are incapable of dealing with many of those detained on the battlefield and their fears that if detainees are handed over to the courts and formally charged , they will be released , placing [ORG Pakistan Army  ] and [ORG Frontier Corps  ] troops at risk . 
This fear is well-founded as both [ORG Anti-Terrorism Courts  ] and the appellate judiciary have a poor track record of dealing with suspects detained in combat operations such as the [ORG Red Mosque  ] operation in [LOC Islamabad  ] and have repeatedly ordered their unconditional release . 
Post assesses that the lack of viable prosecution and punishment options available to the [ORG Pakistan Army  ] and [ORG Frontier Corps  ] is a contributing factor in allowing extra-judicial killings and other human rights abuses of detained terrorist combatants to proceed . 
There may be as many as 5000 such terrorist detainees currently in the custody of the [ORG Pakistan Army  ] and [ORG Frontier Corps  ] from operations in [LOC Malakand  ] , [LOC Bajaur  ] , and [PER Mohmand  ] . 
As operations in these areas and other parts of the [ORG FATA  ] proceed , this number will increase. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG NWFP Police  ] have also been implicated in the abuse and extra-judicial killing of terrorist suspects that they believe responsible for attacks on police stations and individuals in the run-up to the conflict . 
This is a separate problem set from those detained in combat by [ORG Frontier Corps  ] and [ORG Pakistan Army  ] units . 
The [ORG NWFP Inspector General of Police  ] has publicly announced the establishment of a [ORG Human Rights Unit  ] within his office to prevent , investigate , and punish human rights violations committed by his forces . 
As a component of the police training program that we are now standing up for the [ORG NWFP  ] , post intends to offer assistance to the [ORG Inspector General of Police  ] and his new unit on education and prevention of human rights abuses and investigations and prosecutions where abuses are suspected. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In an effort to stem extra-judicial killings and other human rights abuses of these detained in combat by [LOC Pakistan  ] security forces , post is proposing a multi-pronged approach as follows: Short Term: -- [ORG Diplomatic Engagement: Continue  ] to privately raise this issue repeatedly and at the highest levels of the [LOC Pakistan  ] government and military . 
Ensure that expressions of concern over the alleged extra-judicial killings coupled with calls for transparent investigations and , as appropriate , prosecution are included in the talking points of all senior [ORG USG  ] civilian and military visitors in meetings with [MISC Pakistani  ] civilian and military counterparts . 
[ORG Timeline: Ongoing  ] . 
Funding: None required . 
-- Offer Assistance: Coordinate with the [ORG British High Commission  ] on an offer of assistance to the [LOC Defense Minister  ] and the Chief of [ORG Army Staff  ] ( [ORG COAS  ] ) . 
To the [LOC Defense Minister  ] propose assistance in drafting a new [ORG Presidential Order  ] that would create a parallel administrative track for charging and sentencing terrorists detained by the military in combat operations . 
Amendments to the [ORG Anti-Terrorism Act  ] are already well underway . 
To the [ORG COAS  ] , propose bringing over a team of [MISC American  ] and [MISC British  ] experts to evaluate the detainee issue and to determine jointly what assistance is required from coalition partners . 
If [ORG COAS  ] agreement is forthcoming , bring over a team of [MISC American  ] military lawyers to meet with [LOC Pakistan  ] military officials with a view to obtaining concurrence on training in battlefield evidence collection , investigation and prosecution of human rights abuses by military personnel , and assistance on drafting the new [ORG Presidential Order  ] proposed to the [LOC Defense Minister: Timeline: Meeting  ] with [ORG COAS  ] and [LOC Defense Minister  ] by end of September 09 . 
Team deployed by October 09 . 
Funding: Reallocation of existing Foreign Assistance funding . 
-- Evaluate [PER Detainee Situation:  ] Local [LOC Pakistan  ] military commanders and FATA/NWFP officials have approached various offices with request for assistance on dealing with detained combatants under the guise of reintegration . 
Post proposes bringing over a senior representative from [LOC INL’s  ] prison reform office to lay the groundwork for a visiting team that would conduct a formal assessment of conditions and infrastructure/personnel/systems needs of the local prison system for potentially housing these detainees . 
This report would form the baseline for development of an assistance strategy to help the [ORG GOP  ] address the issue . 
[ORG Timeline: INL  ] initial visit in September 2009 . 
Followed by assessment mission in October 2009 with report to be completed by November 2009 . 
Funding: INCLE funds will need to be reallocated . 
Medium Term -- Draft Ordinance: Get [LOC UK  ] agreement to lead a team of [MISC British  ] , and possibly [MISC American  ] , experts to work with the [ORG Pakistan Defense Ministry  ] and [ORG Army  ] to draft a new [ORG Presidential Ordinance  ] for the administrative prosecution and punishment of terrorists detained in combat operations ( this process is already underway in [LOC Pakistan  ] ) . 
Representatives of the [ORG Human Rights Commission  ] of [LOC Pakistan  ] ( [ORG HRCP  ] ) and the [ORG International Committee  ] of the [ORG Red Cross  ] ( [ORG ICRC  ] ) will need to agree to participate in the drafting process . 
Post will approach the [ORG HRCP  ] at an appropriate time but will require [LOC Washington/Geneva  ] assistance in obtaining [ORG ICRC  ] agreement . 
Adoption of the [ORG Presidential Ordinance  ] would offer a credible way for the [LOC Pakistan  ] military/government to prosecute and punish terrorists detained in combat operations . 
[ORG Timeline: Deploy  ] team by December 09 with a view to completing ordinance by April 2010 . 
Funding: Reallocation of existing Foreign Assistance funds .

[ORG Timeline: Launch  ] prison reform program by October 2010 . 
Approach donors on reintegration by September 2010 through SRAP . 
Funding: New INCLE funds will be needed. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Comment: Post fully recognizes that there is little that the [ORG USG  ] can do to change the culture of revenge that underlies many of the extra-judicial killings taking place in the [ORG Malakand Division  ] and [ORG FATA  ] . 
However , it is our view that if senior commanders are offered a viable alternate to deal with detained combatants and a credible detention facility under control of the [ORG Prisons Department  ] is established , the prevalence of human rights abuses will diminish . 
Post recognizes that much of this is dependent on goodwill within the [LOC Pakistan  ] military and civilian establishment that can easily erode if too much public criticism from [ORG USG  ] officials over these incidents is forthcoming . 
For this reason , post advises that we avoid comment on these incidents to the extent possible and that efforts remain focused on dialogue and the assistance strategy outlined above . 
End Comment .
