India/Pakistan -------------- 2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Petraeus  ] asked [PER Karzai  ] to urge [LOC India  ] not to curtail its cooperation with [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[LOC India  ] would never have more positive [MISC Pakistani  ] leadership than [PER Zardari  ] , [PER Gailani  ] , [PER Kiayani  ] , and [ORG Pasha  ] and , in spite of the difficulties , now was the time to try to make progress in the relationship . 
[PER Karzai  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] should urge [LOC China  ] to press [LOC Pakistan  ] , over whom they had great influence , to cooperate with [LOC Afghanistan  ] and with [LOC India  ] . 
He noted that the [MISC Indians  ] were prepared to offer [LOC Afghanistan  ] light attack helicopters . 
A short discussion followed highlighting the adverse reaction in [LOC Pakistan  ] to [MISC Indian  ] provision of military equipment to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Civilian Casualties and [MISC Afghan  ] Participation in Special Ops --------------------------------------------- -------------- 3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) President [PER Karzai  ] raised the civilian casualty issue . 
[PER Petraeus  ] assured him that the [LOC U.S.  ] was taking every step to minimize civilian casualties for both humane and policy reasons . 
He noted the importance of the new tactical directive . 
[PER Petraeus  ] cited recent reports by the respected [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Independent Human Rights Commission  ] that clearly put the onus on the terrorists for civilian casualties , although it also called for more thorough and transparent investigation of allegations by the coalition . 
4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Petraeus  ] noted that the increase of 30,000 [LOC U.S.  ] troops next year would also increase combat , leading to the possibility of increased civilian casualties in the short term . 
President [PER Karzai  ] asked if we really knew who we were fighting . 
[PER Petraeus  ] was categorical that we had confidence in our intelligence and believed we knew who the enemy was . 
[PER Karzai  ] said that [MISC Afghans  ] were suspicious of the [LOC U.S.  ] because of the situation in [LOC Helmand.  ] &The tribes must back you , 8 he said , and that does not mean recreating tribal militias . 
5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Petraeus  ] noted that [PER Karzai  ] had not acted on our request for 100 [MISC Afghans  ] to accompany our special operations forces on night raids . 
[PER Karzai  ] argued that 100 [MISC Afghans  ] would not give [LOC Afghanistan  ] meaningful control over the operation but would force them to take responsibility when a mistake was made . 
He promised to study the issue further and called for greater [MISC Afghan  ] participation in both the selection of targets and the implementation of operations . 
[PER Petraeus  ] suggested that on a pilot project basis we might consider putting more [MISC Afghans  ] with one of our special strike forces so that they could in reality conduct the operation . 
He emphasized the importance that the [LOC U.S.  ] should remain in a position to conduct after-action site exploitation for intelligence purposes . 
6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Karzai  ] raised the issue of the use of dogs in house raids . 
He said it was unacceptable in the [MISC Afghan  ] culture and was used by [ORG Taliban  ] propaganda to undermine support for the coalition and the government . 
Interior Minister Atmar , with [MISC Karzai’s  ] support , argued that if [MISC Afghans  ] were allowed to be “first through the door , ” they we prepared to run the risk of not using dogs in order to respect cultural sensitivities . 
[MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Taliban  ] -------------- 7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Karzai  ] raised the [LOC Quetta  ] [MISC Shura  ] . 
He said that [MISC Afghans  ] didn’t understand why the [LOC U.S  ] was making such an effort inside of [LOC Afghanistan  ] , but was failing to go after the [ORG Taliban  ] in [LOC Quetta  ] . 
They thought either “the [LOC U.S.  ] has been deceived by [MISC Pakistan”  ] or “there was some secret deal” not to go after the [LOC Quetta  ] [MISC Shura  ] “because [LOC Pakistan  ] was more important to the [LOC U.S.  ] than [MISC Afghanistan.”  ] He stressed the need to be able to go back to the [MISC Afghan  ] people and make it clear that the [LOC U.S.  ] was serious about defeating [MISC Afghanistan’s  ] enemies . 
8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Petraeus  ] assured [PER Karzai  ] that we considered the [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Taliban  ] an important enemy which we were confronting in every way we could . 
He underlined our vital national interest in preventing global terrorism from ever again using [LOC Afghanistan  ] as a launching pad . 
[PER Karzai  ] nodded affirmatively throughout the [MISC General’s  ] presentation and said that the people of [LOC Afghanistan  ] wanted to see more clearly that the [LOC U.S.  ] would not allow [LOC Afghanistan  ] to be a base for terrorism again . 
Relations with [ORG New Administration  ] ---------------------------------- 9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Karzai  ] raised recent critical statements attributed to Senator [PER Clinton  ] , but said he was enthusiastic about his relationship with her . 
[PER Karzai  ] stressed the need for us to address frankly our problems with each other and respond seriously to the concerns of each side . 
He praised the visit of Secretary [PER Gates  ] shortly after the [LOC Shindand  ] incident in August and said that the visit had served to completely defuse the [LOC Shindand  ] incident . 
10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Early in the discussion , [PER Petraeus  ] said that he would be returning to [LOC Washington  ] for a first meeting with President [PER Obama  ] , and offered to convey a message from [PER Karzai  ] . 
[PER Karzai  ] returned to the message throughout the discussion , highlighting the need for mutual respect and cooperation , the need to resolve the civilian casualties issue and increase [MISC Afghan  ] participation in special operations , and a tougher line on sanctuaries in [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
2009 ---- 11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In conclusion , [PER Karzai  ] said that 2009 would be a difficult and important year . 
Additional troops would make a big difference . 
Successful elections would be crucial . 
Other Comments -------------- 12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Karzai  ] then invited other [MISC Afghan  ] participants at the table to make comments . 
Minister of [ORG Defense Wardak  ] called for increased coordination in the battle space , especially with the proliferation of the additional forces and additional players . 
He also argued for the eventual further increase of the [ORG National Army  ] beyond the planned 134,000 . 
13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Foreign Minister [PER Spanta  ] expressed concern about the “fragmentation” of the international community and urged the [LOC U.S.  ] to play a more active role in making development assistance more coherent . 
He said that the target should not simply be to rebuild [LOC Afghanistan  ] but to genuinely increase aid effectiveness . 
14 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Minister of Interior Atmar said that it was important that our two constituencies -- the [MISC Afghan  ] public and the [LOC U.S.  ] public -- be able to see the two allies united and able to solve problems between them . 
He said there was still strong support for the [MISC American  ] presence . 
He stressed the need: ( 1 ) to strengthen [MISC Afghan  ] government institutions including the police , ( 2 ) to make clear that the [LOC U.S.  ] cares for the wellbeing of [MISC Afghan  ] citizens , and ( 3 ) to take meaningful action against the sanctuaries against the [ORG Taliban  ] in [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
15 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) NDS Director [PER Saleh  ] simply noted the need for a larger NDS and asked for [LOC U.S.  ] support .
