( C ) SUMMARY AND [ORG COMMENT: National Court Prosecutor Jose  ] “Pepe” [PER Grinda Gonzalez  ] on January 14 gave a detailed , frank assessment of the activities and reach of organized crime ( [ORG OC  ] ) in both [LOC Eurasia  ] and [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC Spain’s  ] strategy for how best to combat it in court . 
As he did so , he evaluated the levels of cooperation that [LOC Spain  ] receives from numerous countries . 
[PER Grinda  ] presented his remarks on January 13 at the new [MISC US-Spain Counter-Terrorism  ] and [ORG Organized Crime Experts Working Group  ] meeting in [LOC Madrid  ] ( See Ref A ) . 
He provided a 17-page , [MISC English-language  ] handout entitled , “The [ORG Organized Crime  ] and the [MISC Russian  ] Mafia , ” which he used as the basis for his remarks , which were more explicit than the document is . 
( [ORG NOTE: Post  ] will send a copy of the handout to interested parties . 
) Grinda’s comments are insightful and valuable , given his in-depth knowledge of the [MISC Eurasian  ] mafia and his key role in [LOC Spain’s  ] pioneering efforts to bring [MISC Eurasian  ] mafia leaders to justice . 
END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. //Bio Info// <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [PER Grinda  ] , a Special Prosecutor for Corruption and [ORG Organized Crime  ] , in early December wrapped up his prosecution of the alleged [ORG OC  ] network led by [PER Zahkar Kalashov  ] , the [MISC Georgian-born  ] , [MISC Russian  ] citizen who allegedly is a “vor v zakone , ” ( “Thief in Law , ” the highest echelon of [MISC Russian  ] [ORG OC  ] leadership ) and reportedly the most senior [MISC Russian  ] mafia figure jailed outside [LOC Russia  ] . 
The defendants were arrested as part of [MISC Operation Avispa  ] ( see Refs B and C ) . 
A verdict is expected by early February , according to [PER Belen Suarez  ] , Deputy Prosecutor for Corruption and [ORG Organized Crime  ] and one of Grinda’s superiors . 
[PER Grinda  ] is known to [ORG Post’s Legat Office  ] as a skilled and rigorous professional with deep subject matter expertise . 
He is forward-leaning in his cooperation with the [ORG USG  ] and grateful for [ORG USG  ] assistance . 
His work places him under considerable stress , which make him suspicious of penetration attempts by intelligence services and causes him to have heightened sensitivities regarding his physical security . 
[PER Grinda  ] also will be the prosecutor in the trial for those arrested in [ORG Operation Troika  ] ( See Refs B and C ) . //Nomenclature// <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Grinda’s was the first presentation at the January 13 meeting and his candor set the tone for an open exchange of ideas and information . 
He began by urging those present to speak frankly with each other in this closed door session . 
He said that what we are confronting is the “Russian mafia” even if the term “Eurasian mafia” is more socially acceptable and what the [MISC Russians  ] certainly prefer . 
He acknowledged that the term [MISC Russian  ] mafia can be a misnomer since these criminal groups sometimes involve [MISC Ukrainians  ] , [MISC Georgians  ] , [MISC Belarusians  ] [LOC MADRID  ] 00000154 002.2 OF 005 or [MISC Chechens  ] . 
He nevertheless questioned the stigma surrounding the phrase “Russian mafia” and noted it is acceptable to say “Sicilian mafia.” <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C//NF ) [PER Grinda  ] stated that he considers [LOC Belarus  ] , [LOC Chechnya  ] and [LOC Russia  ] to be virtual “mafia states” and said that [LOC Ukraine  ] is going to be one . 
For each of those countries , he alleged , one cannot differentiate between the activities of the government and [ORG OC  ] groups. //Identifying The [ORG Scope of The Threat  ] the [MISC Russian  ] Mafia Poses// <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Grinda  ] suggested that there are two reasons to worry about the [MISC Russian  ] mafia . 
First , it exercises “tremendous control” over certain strategic sectors of the global economy , such as aluminum . 
He made a passing remark that the [ORG USG  ] has a strategic problem in that the [MISC Russian  ] mafia is suspected of having a sizable investment in XXXXXXXXXXXX 6 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) The second reason is the unanswered question regarding the extent to which [MISC Russian  ] PM Putin is implicated in the [MISC Russian  ] mafia and whether he controls the mafia’s actions . 
[PER Grinda  ] cited a “thesis” by [PER Alexander Litvinenko  ] , the former [MISC Russian  ] intelligence official who worked on [ORG OC  ] issues before he died in late 2006 in [LOC London  ] from poisoning under mysterious circumstances , that the [MISC Russian  ] intelligence and security services - [PER Grinda  ] cited the [ORG Federal Security Service  ] ( [ORG FSB  ] ) , the [ORG Foreign Intelligence Service  ] ( [ORG SVR  ] ) , and military intelligence ( [ORG GRU  ] ) - control [ORG OC  ] in [LOC Russia  ] . 
[PER Grinda  ] stated that he believes this thesis is accurate . 
( COMMENT: See Ref B on a reported meeting between [PER Litvinenko  ] and the [MISC Spanish  ] security services shortly before his death . 
) [PER Grinda  ] said that he believes the [ORG FSB  ] is “absorbing” the [MISC Russian  ] mafia but they can also “eliminate” them in two ways: by killing [ORG OC  ] leaders who do not do what the security services want them to do or by putting them behind bars to eliminate them as a competitor for influence . 
The crimelords can also be put in jail for their own protection. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [PER Grinda  ] said that according to information he has received from intelligence services , witnesses and phone taps , certain political parties in [LOC Russia  ] operate “hand in hand” with [ORG OC  ] . 
For example , he argued that the [ORG Liberal Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG LDP  ] ) was created by the [ORG KGB  ] and its successor , the [ORG SVR  ] , and is home to many serious criminals . 
[PER Grinda  ] further alleged that there are proven ties between the [MISC Russian  ] political parties , organized crime and arms trafficking . 
Without elaborating , he cited the strange case of the “Arctic [MISC Sea”  ] ship in mid-2009 as “a clear example” of arms trafficking. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [PER Grinda  ] said what he has read from 10-12 years’ worth of investigations on [ORG OC  ] has led him to believe that whereas terrorists aim to substitute the essence of the state itself , [ORG OC  ] seeks to be a complement to state structures . 
He summarized his views by asserting that the GOR’s strategy is [LOC MADRID  ] 00000154 003.2 OF 005 to use [ORG OC  ] groups to do whatever the [ORG GOR  ] cannot acceptably do as a government . 
As an example , he cited [PER Kalashov  ] , whom he said worked for [MISC Russian  ] military intelligence to sell weapons to the [MISC Kurds  ] to destabilize [LOC Turkey  ] . 
[PER Grinda  ] claimed that the [ORG GOR  ] takes the relationship with [ORG OC  ] leaders even further by granting them the privileges of politics , in order to grant them immunity from racketeering charges. //The [MISC Spanish  ] Strategy to Combat the [MISC Russian  ] Mafia: Follow the [MISC Money//  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Grinda  ] traced the history of the [MISC Russian  ] mafia in [LOC Spain  ] to the mid-1990s , when several vory v zakone began to enter [LOC Spain  ] . 
He said that since 2004 [MISC Spanish  ] prosecutors have created a formal strategy to “behead” the [MISC Russian  ] mafia in [LOC Spain  ] . 
He explained that this has been a top-down strategy done through extensive investigations of criminal actions by these vory v zakone living in [LOC Spain  ] . 
These individuals have no known jobs and unknown sources of income , yet they live in large mansions . 
[MISC Spanish  ] prosecutors have concluded that money-laundering is likely involved and the challenge has been how to prove this . 
[PER Grinda  ] says that Spain’s longtime experience in fighting drug traffickers’ use of money laundering has proven valuable in this regard. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Grinda  ] says the money-laundering investigations have a two-fold objective: to prevent the targets from profiting from the original crime and to prevent the targets from gaining enough clout to enjoy economic influence , which [PER Grinda  ] suggested sooner or later always reaches political power . 
This is why Spain’s Attorney General has grouped together the prosecutors’ office for anti-corruption and organized crime . 
As part of this strategy to prevent mafiosos from enjoying economic influence , [MISC Spain’s  ] strategy includes the seizure of businesses , companies , furniture and other assets. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Grinda  ] also addressed the challenges of combating [ORG OC  ] when it enjoys political , economic , social and - especially - legal protection . 
[PER Grinda  ] applauded a document provided by the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation which addressed the important role the media can play in warning the public of OC’s activities and the threat that [ORG OC  ] poses . 
The media can create an environment in which politicians would be reluctant to be friends with and do favors for mafia leaders , whom [PER Grinda  ] argued need to be seen as shady figures to be feared . 
Regarding legal protection , [PER Grinda  ] stated that a key factor in a government’s ability to combat [ORG OC  ] depends on the extent to which the country’s best attorneys and law firms represent the mafia . 
In this regard , he asked rhetorically , “Why is [MISC Cuatrecases  ] constantly defending [MISC Russian  ] mafia members ? ” ( COMMENT: [MISC Cuatrecases  ] is one of [MISC Spain’s  ] leading law firms . 
Its website , available in [MISC English  ] , is www.cuatrecasas.com . 
) <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Grinda  ] stated that [ORG OC  ] begins to accumulate both economic and political power when it begins to bid for contract tenders on civil works and infrastructure projects . 
[LOC MADRID  ] 00000154 004.2 OF 005 He noted , however , that the vory v zakone do not engage in racketeering and murder , preferring to distance themselves from this activity and focus on crimes that are further up in the hierarchy , such as corruption of high-level ministers . 
The level of power that vory v zakone operate at is indicated by their level of interaction with these public servants , because cabinet-level officials do not spend time with unimportant people and cannot be tempted by those who do not have something important to offer . 
[PER Grinda  ] commented that [PER Gennadios Petrov  ] , the chief target of [MISC Spain’s Operation Troika  ] ( See Refs B and C ) , was engaged in a “dangerously close” level of contact with senior [MISC Russian  ] officials . 
COMMENT: In a surprise move , [MISC Spanish  ] judges granted bail to [PER Petrov  ] , who is out on house arrest as of January 31 , 2010 . 
END COMMENT. //Thoughts on International Collaboration// <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [PER Grinda  ] addressed the collaboration [LOC Spain  ] receives from other countries regarding the [MISC Russian  ] mafia . 
Early in his remarks , he thanked the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation for Washington’s assistance to his office on corruption and [ORG OC  ] issues . 
He said that it is important to have the [ORG DOJ  ] , [ORG FBI  ] , and [PER Post’s Legat  ] office as collaborating partners and assessed that he and his [LOC U.S.  ] interlocutors collaborate in “a very efficient manner.” He added that the close level of [MISC US-GOS  ] cooperation on [ORG OC  ] issues is known in some circles and has led some to say that he and [LOC Spain  ] are “the executing hand of the [ORG USG  ] regarding the [MISC Russian  ] mafia.” He said that description is fine by him. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [PER Grinda  ] said that the [ORG Spanish National Police  ] ( [ORG SNP  ] ) , the [ORG Civil Guard  ] ( [ORG GC  ] ) , Spain’s financial intelligence unit ( [ORG SEPBLAC  ] ) , and the surveillance division of the [ORG Customs Police  ] together have compiled a solid portfolio of information on the [MISC Russian  ] mafia in [LOC Spain  ] . 
He added that [LOC Germany  ] , [LOC Switzerland  ] , [LOC Austria  ] , [LOC Belgium  ] and the [ORG USG  ] have been valuable partners in supplementing this information to further flesh out Grinda’s office’s understanding of the [MISC Russian  ] mafia’s activities . 
He added that [LOC Spain  ] is beginning to collaborate with [LOC France  ] on these issues , but singled out the [LOC United Kingdom  ] for its lack of cooperation . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [PER Grinda  ] described [ORG OC  ] as “very powerful” in [LOC Georgia  ] and claimed that the intertwined ties there between the government and [ORG OC  ] began under former President [PER Shevardnadze  ] , when he alleges a paramilitary group served as a de facto shadow presidency . 
Although [PER Grinda  ] acknowledged improvements under current President [PER Saakashvili  ] , he said that there are still “limitations” in [LOC Georgia’s  ] efforts to combat [ORG OC  ] . 
Citing his personal experience in trying to secure [MISC Georgian  ] assistance in the prosecution of Kalashov’s [ORG OC  ] network in [LOC MADRID  ] 00000154 005.2 OF 005 [LOC Spain  ] ( See upcoming septel on the [MISC Kalashov  ] trial ) , [PER Grinda  ] said that he feels “completely abandoned” and “betrayed” by [LOC Georgia  ] and the explanations that he has received from [LOC Georgia  ] regarding its lack of cooperation are “more pathetic than the betrayal itself.” <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) To illustrate his thoughts on the level of cooperation [LOC Spain  ] receives from [LOC Russia  ] , [PER Grinda  ] reviewed Spain’s efforts to arrest [PER Tariel Oniani  ] as part of [ORG Operation Avispa  ] . 
( See Refs B , C and D . 
) In June 2005 , [PER Georgian-born Oniani  ] fled to [LOC Russia  ] hours before he was to be arrested in [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC Russia  ] gave him citizenship in April 2006 , despite the fact that he had fled [MISC Spanish  ] justice . 
[PER Grinda  ] alleged that the granting of citizenship was neither “innocent” nor “something done for free , ” and was an example of [LOC Russia  ] putting crimelords to work on behalf of its interests . 
[PER Grinda  ] alleged that the [MISC Russian  ] Ministry of [MISC Interior  ] and the FSB are closely protecting [PER Oniani  ] in [LOC Russia  ] ( even in prison ) . 
Following Oniani’s arrest in [LOC Moscow  ] in June 2009 , [LOC Spain  ] requested his extradition for charges stemming from [ORG Operation Avispa  ] , to which [LOC Russia  ] replied that Oniani’s [MISC Russian  ] citizenship prevented him from being extradited . 
[PER Grinda  ] said that [LOC Russia  ] “always tells [LOC Spain  ] that it will take away Oniani’s citizenship , but it never does.” [PER Grinda  ] said that , from his experience , “A virture of the [MISC Russian  ] government is that it will always say and do the same thing: nothing.” <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( U ) The [LOC U.S.  ] delegation to [MISC US-Spain  ] Counter-Terrorism and [ORG Organized Crime Experts Working Group  ] cleared this cable .
