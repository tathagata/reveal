End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) On October 6 , State Secretary ( Under Secretary equivalent ) [PER Francisco Ros  ] addressed an audience of about 80 at an [MISC AmCham-hosted  ] breakfast , speaking on " The Development of the [ORG Information Society  ] in Boosting [MISC U.S.-Spain  ] relations . 
" Following that event , he met with the [ORG AmCham  ] 's [ORG Intellectual Property Committee  ] , composed of representatives of the software , film , music , and video games industries . 
A DEAL IMMINENT ? <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In a conversation with [ORG Econoffs  ] before the event began , State Secretary [PER Ros  ] , who is scheduled to visit [LOC Washington  ] November 19-22 , said that the government will announce a new initiative related to [ORG IPR  ] protection and [MISC Internet  ] piracy " in a matter of days . 
" [ORG Econoffs  ] later spoke to [PER Aldo Olcese  ] , President of the [ORG Coalition of Creators and Content Providers  ] , who confirmed that the government was putting considerable pressure on [ORG Redtel  ] , the [ORG ISP  ] association , to agree to what [PER Olcese  ] characterized as a " de minimis " anti-piracy agreement . 
The [ORG Coalition  ] is not enthusiastic about the proposed agreement but intends to accept it as a way to get the government more actively engaged in finding and implementing solutions . 
[PER Olcese  ] estimated that the first part of the agreement , establishing a government authority that would take action against a number of high-profile websites known to make pirated content available , could be ready by the end of this week . 
The second part , on making legal content available online , could , if accepted by [ORG Redtel  ] , be ready by October 16 , he said . 
REMARKS <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) In his formal remarks , State Secretary [PER Ros  ] provided statistics on the impressive growth in [MISC Internet  ] penetration in [LOC Spain  ] and as well as the strong performance of the IT sector in the face of the economic downturn . 
A major focus of his remarks was promotion of the 3rd International Frum on [ORG Digital Content  ] ( [ORG FICOD  ] 2009 ) to be held in [LOC Madrid  ] , November 17-19 . 
The [ORG GOS  ] has invited the [LOC U.S.  ] to participate in [ORG FICOD  ] as the featured country ( " invitado de honor " ) and is seeking USG and private-sector participation. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Towards the end of his speech , [PER Ros  ] turned briefly to [ORG IPR  ] issues , commenting that " there are no objective data provided by any entity that shows that [LOC Spain  ] has more [MISC Internet  ] piracy than its neighboring countries . 
" He characterized assertions by industry that [LOC Spain  ] has one of the highest [MISC Internet  ] piracy rates in the world as an " urban legend . 
" He referred to [LOC Eurostat  ] figures that he said show that [MISC Spanish  ] youth share files at about the same volume as their peers in the [LOC UK  ] , [LOC France  ] , and [LOC Germany  ] . 
Nevertheless , he said , [LOC Spain  ] takes [ORG IPR  ] protection seriously and is among the first countries to promote collaborative international actions to combat the phenomenon . 
[PER Ros  ] argued that no country can solve the piracy problem on its own and that a global approach is needed . 
[LOC Spain  ] hopes to develop such an approach during its January-June 2010 Presidency of the [ORG European Union  ] . 
Meanwhile , he stressed that " putting into place measures that don't work " only serves to create false expectations that lead to disappointment and frustration . 
METING WITH AMCHAM IP COMMITTEE <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) In his subsequent meeting with the [ORG AmCham  ] 's [ORG Intellectual Property  ] committee , [PER Ros  ] returned to these [ORG MADRID  ] 00000982 002.3 OF 002 themes , averring that [LOC Spain  ] 's " bad reputation " for piracy predates the era of illicit downloads and file-sharing , and derives from the street piracy practice known as " top manta , " in which infringing goods are sold at informal street markets , and hidden under blankets when police appear . 
( Note: " Top manta " is still widespread in [LOC Spain  ] , but police have been increasingly effective in combating it in recent years , though there have been calls to decriminalize the practice since it is allegedly practiced by impoverished immigrants . 
End Note . 
) He insisted that the practices and habits of [MISC Spanish  ] [MISC Internet  ] users are no different than those of people in other , similar countries . 
In this context , he insinuated that [LOC Spain  ] 's placement on the Special 301 Watch List in 2008 and 2009 was arbitrary and unfair. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) [PER Ros  ] said any attempt to reduce online piracy should have three components: repression , education , and the exploitation of new models to make content legally available online . 
He added that the [MISC Spanish  ] government is seeking ways , under existing authority , to pursue and take out of commission some 100 websites that are responsible for perhaps as much as 80 percent of infringing content . 
Defending the [MISC Spanish  ] government 's [ORG IPR  ] performance , he cited figures showing the number of cases of [MISC Internet  ] piracy pursued by police and prosecutors over the past four years , even while recognizing that many judges in [LOC Spain  ] are not well equipped to understand or dispose correctly of intellectual property cases . 
[PER Ros  ] also mentioned public education campaigns [LOC Spain  ] has undertaking , while noting that content providers needed to offer an alternative to illegal downloading and file-sharing , using new forms of distribution to make quality products available on the [MISC Internet  ] at attractive prices. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) [PER Ros  ] told the rights-holders' representatives that " very soon , " [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG Council of Ministers  ] will receive for its approval a proposal for regulatory reform to address digital piracy . 
While not ruling out new legislation to strengthen the government 's authority , [PER Ros  ] lamented that getting a law through [ORG Congress  ] could take years and would likely arouse bitter opposition. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) [ORG AmCham  ] President [PER Jaime Malet  ] and various of those present told State Secretary [PER Ros  ] that the important point was not whether piracy in [LOC Spain  ] was worse than in other countries , but rather that it was clearly bad enough to merit and require forceful government action . 
In order for content providers to invest more in the [MISC Spanish  ] market , there needs to be an adequate legal and regulatory framework to support quality content and make possible a decent return on investment . 
The film and music industries have seen marked declines in sales over the past several years , attributable to the growth of [MISC Internet  ] piracy . 
[PER Ros  ] claimed that [LOC Spain  ] 's legal and regulatory framework was on a par with those of [LOC France  ] , [LOC Germany  ] , and the [LOC UK  ] . 
COMMENT <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While not challenging to his face [PER Ros  ] 's assertions that industry has wrongly stigmatized [LOC Spain  ] , a number of industry representatives present were clearly incensed with his " urban legend " remark and the argument behind it . 
A representative of a local [ORG Disney  ] affiliate told [MISC Econoff  ] afterwards that his company take serious issue with [PER Ros  ] 's claim that there are no objective data showing [LOC Spain  ] 's piracy problem to be worse than other countries' . 
[PER Aldo Olcese  ] cited the attitude behind [PER Ros  ] 's assertions as illustrative of the difficulties the [ORG Coalition  ] has encountered in trying to get the government to act more vigorously against [MISC Internet  ] piracy . 
During his visit to [LOC Washington  ] , [PER Ros  ] will meet with the International [ORG Intellectual Proerty Alliance  ] ( [ORG IIPA  ] ) and the [ORG Motion Picture Association of America  ] ( [ORG MPAA  ] ) , among others . 
These groups will no doubt challenge his denigration of their data and his complacent assessment of [LOC Spain  ] 's [MISC Internet  ] piracy situation and legal regime . 
USTR will also have the opportunity to help him understand why [LOC Spain  ] is on the Watch List and what it must do to get off it . 
The news from both [PER Olcese  ] and [PER Ros  ] that an agreement and a government initiative are close to fruition is certainly welcome , and such an agreement , however modest , would be an important step in the right direction. .
