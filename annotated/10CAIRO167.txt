( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Egyptian  ] military is requesting third-party transfer approval for the sale of M1A1 tanks and ammunition to [LOC Iraq  ] . 
All of the equipment is produced in [LOC Egypt  ] under a co-production agreement with the [LOC United States  ] . 
The country team supports the sale. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [LOC Egypt  ] proposes selling 140 M1A1 tanks , ammunition , training , spare parts , and maintenance to the [MISC Iraqi  ] army for an undisclosed amount of money . 
We understand that a number of complex issues would first need to be addressed given [MISC Egyptian  ] and [MISC Iraqi  ] budgetary constraints , ongoing development of a foreign military assistance plan for [LOC Iraq  ] , legal issues related to the co-production agreement , and the potential concerns of [ORG General Dynamics  ] . 
In principle , however , we strongly support this sale and the positive contributions it would make to strengthening [MISC Egyptian-Iraqi  ] ties. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) After an initially cautious approach to the [MISC Maliki  ] government , [LOC Egypt  ] has taken serious steps over the last year to develop stronger political , economic , and military ties with [LOC Iraq  ] . 
We view these efforts as crucial to building [LOC Iraq  ] 's ties with the [MISC Arab  ] world and reducing [MISC Iranian  ] influence . 
The tank deal is part of a much broader [MISC Egyptian  ] effort to strengthen the bilateral relationship . 
In November 2009 , [LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] signed 16 MOUs across several fields , including science and technology , agriculture , communications , security affairs and military training .
