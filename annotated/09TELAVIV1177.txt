Moreno  ] , reasons 1.4 ( b , d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [PER Summary: Post  ] hosted two CODELS during the week of May 25: one from the [ORG Senate Foreign Relations Committee  ] led by Senator [PER Casey  ] , the other from the [ORG House Committee  ] on [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] led by Congressman [PER Ackerman  ] . 
Both delegations met with Defense Minister [PER Ehud Barak  ] , who conveyed similar points on the [ORG Peace Process and Israel  ] 's concerns about [LOC Iran  ] . 
End summary . 
[ORG Peace Process  ] ------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Barak  ] began his meeting with the [PER Casey  ] delegation by apologizing for being late due to what he described as an " internal debate " at the Prime Minister 's office regarding the development of a response to President [PER Obama  ] 's upcoming speech in [LOC Cairo  ] . 
He noted there are " perceived gaps " between the [ORG USG  ] and the [ORG GOI  ] regarding the [ORG Peace Process  ] , and explained the [ORG GOI  ] 's internal debate is focused primarily on how to ensure that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Israel  ] " trust each other . 
" [PER Barak  ] expressed confidence that PM Netanyahu is sincere in wanting to " seize this opportunity and move forward " with the [MISC Palestinians  ] , but alluded to members of the coalition who do not agree with this course of action. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) From his perspective , [PER Barak  ] told the [PER Casey  ] delegation that the [ORG GOI  ] was in no position to dictate policy to the [MISC Palestinians  ] or the [ORG USG  ] regarding the [ORG Peace Process  ] -- " it takes two to tango , and three to negotiate , " he said . 
[PER Barak  ] noted that it is the [ORG GOI  ] 's responsibility to ensure that " no stone is left unturned " regarding the [ORG Peace Process  ] ; if efforts to achieve peace ultimately fail , then the [ORG GOI  ] must be able to state that every effort was pursued . 
He said he personally had no objection to " two states for two nations , " and panned [MISC Arab  ] arguments for a bi-national state in [LOC Israel  ] . 
[PER Barak  ] said [LOC Israel  ] envisions " two peoples living side by side in peace and good neighborliness " as the final goal. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) With the [PER Ackerman  ] delegation , [PER Barak  ] focused on the need for a regional approach to the peace process . 
He supports a regional initiative for peace and cooperation for the entire [LOC Middle East  ] region to be launched by [LOC Israel  ] . 
He stressed as well the need to build trust and convince the [LOC U.S.  ] administration that the new [MISC Israeli  ] government is " serious in its efforts toward peace . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Barak  ] commented on political developments in the [LOC West Bank  ] and [LOC Gaza  ] in both meetings . 
He said the [ORG GOI  ] continues to review its policy , and then added that the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] has much to accomplish in terms of law enforcement , a functioning judiciary , and regaining control of [LOC Gaza  ] before a " balanced " [MISC Palestinian  ] state can be created . 
He has been extremely impressed with the work of [ORG U.S. Security Coordinator Gen. Dayton  ] training [LOC PA  ] security forces , and commended [PER Salam Fayyad  ] 's concrete , practical approach. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Barak  ] made clear in these meetings that he feels the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] is weak and lacks self-confidence , and that [ORG Gen. Dayton  ] 's training helps bolster confidence . 
He explained that the [ORG GOI  ] had consulted with [LOC Egypt  ] and [PER Fatah  ] prior to [MISC Operation Cast Lead  ] , asking if they were willing to assume control of [LOC Gaza  ] once [LOC Israel  ] defeated [ORG Hamas  ] . 
Not surprisingly , [PER Barak  ] said , the [ORG GOI  ] received negative answers from both . 
He stressed the importance of continued consultations with both [LOC Egypt  ] and [PER Fatah  ] -- as well as the [LOC NGO  ] community -- regarding [LOC Gaza  ] reconstruction , and to avoid publicly linking any resolution in [LOC Gaza  ] to the release of kidnapped [ORG IDF  ] soldier [PER Gilad Shalit  ] . 
[LOC Iran/North Korea  ] ---------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) In his meeting with [ORG CODEL Casey  ] , [PER Barak  ] said the [ORG GOI  ] believes its " keystone " relations with the [ORG USG  ] remain strong . 
He described the integral role the [ORG USG  ] plays in preserving [LOC Israel  ] 's [ORG Qualitative Military Edge  ] ( [ORG QME  ] ) , especially when faced with threats posed by [LOC Iran  ] , [ORG Hizballah  ] , and [ORG Hamas  ] . 
He noted that the [ORG GOI  ] 's positions on [LOC Iran  ] are well known , and described [LOC North Korea  ] 's recent nuclear test as a " second wake-up call " ( the first being the [PER AQ Khan  ] network ) . 
[PER Barak  ] asked rhetorically how a lack of firm response to [LOC North Korea  ] would be interpreted by [LOC Iran  ] 's leadership , speculating the [ORG USG  ] would be viewed as a " paper tiger . 
" <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) In both meetings , [PER Barak  ] said " no option should be removed from the table " when confronting [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC North Korea  ] ; engagement will only work in conjunction with a credible military option , he said . 
[PER Barak  ] said he was [ORG TEL AVIV  ] 00001177 002 OF 002 personally skeptical that engagement would lead to an acceptable resolution , and argued in favor of a paradigm shift to confront the triple threat posed by nuclear proliferation , [MISC Islamic  ] extremist terrorism , and rogue/failing states . 
He said a strategic partnership with [LOC China  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC India  ] , and the [ORG EU  ] is essential in facing these threats . 
[PER Barak  ] argued that failure to prevent a nuclear-armed [LOC Iran  ] would result in a nuclear arms race in the region as [LOC Turkey  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] , and [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] look to acquire nuclear weapons. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) When asked if the [ORG USG  ] and [ORG GOI  ] have fundamental differences of opinion when assessing [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program , [PER Barak  ] said we share the same intelligence , but acknowledged differences in analysis . 
He suggested that the [ORG USG  ] view is similar to presenting evidence in a criminal court case in which a defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty . 
As such , [ORG USG  ] standards are tougher -- especially following the failure to find [ORG WMD  ] in [LOC Iraq  ] -- while end-products such as the 2007 NIE unintentionally take on a softer tone as a result . 
[PER Barak  ] said the fate of the region and the world rests on our ability to prevent [LOC Iran  ] from gaining nuclear weapons -- as such , the standards for determining guilt should be lower as the costs are higher. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) In both meetings , [PER Barak  ] described [MISC Iranians  ] as " chess , not backgammon players . 
" As such , [LOC Iran  ] will attempt to avoid any hook to hang accusations on , and look to [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC North Korea  ] as models to emulate in terms of acquiring nuclear weapons while defying the international community . 
He doubted [LOC Tehran  ] would opt for an open , relatively low-threshold test like the recent one in [LOC North Korea  ] . 
Rather , [LOC Iran  ] will seek ways to bypass the [ORG NPT  ] while ensuring its program is redundant and well-protected to prevent an irreparable military strike . 
[PER Barak  ] estimated a window between 6 and 18 months from now in which stopping [LOC Iran  ] from acquiring nuclear weapons might still be viable . 
After that , he said , any military solution would result in unacceptable collateral damage . 
He also expressed concern that should [LOC Iran  ] develop nuclear capabilities , other rogue states and/or terrorist groups would not be far behind . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] -------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Barak  ] reinforced his message regarding [LOC Pakistan  ] in both meetings . 
He described [LOC Pakistan  ] as his " private nightmare , " suggesting the world might wake up one morning " with everything changed " following a potential [MISC Islamic  ] extremist takeover . 
When asked if the use of force on [LOC Iran  ] might backfire with moderate [MISC Muslims  ] in [LOC Pakistan  ] , thereby exacerbating the situation , [PER Barak  ] acknowledged [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] are interconnected , but disagreed with a causal chain . 
To the contrary , he argued that if the [LOC United States  ] had directly confronted [LOC North Korea  ] in recent years , others would be less inclined to pursue nuclear weapons programs . 
By avoiding confrontation with [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Barak  ] argued , the [LOC U.S.  ] faces a perception of weakness in the region. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( U ) [ORG CODELS Casey  ] and [PER Ackerman  ] did not have the opportunity to clear this message. ********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy [ORG Tel Aviv  ] 's Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv ********************************************* ******************** CUNNINGHAM</pre></code>
