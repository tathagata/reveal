Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [ORG Liaoning Party  ] Secretary [PER Li Keqiang  ] , a front runner for elevation to the [MISC Politburo  ] this fall and potential successor to President [PER Hu Jintao  ] in 2012 , described the challenges he faces as a provincial leader to the Ambassador over dinner on March 12 . 
Engaging and well-informed , [PER Li  ] related that despite brisk economic growth , Liaoning’s income gaps remain severe . 
To create a “harmonious society , ” he has tried to guarantee minimum living standards by providing new housing to the destitute and a job to every household . 
The public is dissatisfied with education , health care and housing , but it is corruption that truly incenses them . 
On foreign policy , [PER Li  ] said United [MISC States-China  ] relations are developing smoothly , welcoming bilateral cooperation on [LOC North Korea  ] . 
Turning to trade relations , [PER Li  ] claimed that [LOC China  ] is boosting imports , domestic consumption and social safety nets both to balance trade and further its own development . 
Concerned by protectionist sentiment in the [LOC United States  ] and what he described as a lack of understanding about [LOC China  ] in [ORG Congress  ] , [PER Li  ] passionately argued in defense of free trade and said more Members of [ORG Congress  ] should visit the [LOC PRC  ] . 
Regarding [MISC China’s  ] ongoing [ORG National People’s Congress  ] session , [PER Li  ] judged that passage of the draft property law and promoting programs to address social issues are most important . 
End Summary . 
[ORG NPC: Focus on Property Law  ] , Social Issues ------------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG Liaoning Party  ] Secretary [PER Li Keqiang  ] , identified as a potential “fifth generation” leader and possible successor to President [PER Hu Jintao  ] , joined the Ambassador for dinner at his residence on March 12 . 
In town for the ongoing [ORG National People’s Congress  ] ( [ORG NPC  ] ) session , [PER Li  ] judged the draft property law and social issues to be the most important subjects for the [ORG Liaoning  ] delegation . 
The property law , which will impact the foundation of [MISC China’s  ] economic system , demonstrates just how far [LOC China  ] has come in 30 years of reform . 
Most Deputies believe the bill’s passage is “assured , ” given the nearly unanimous support it received from the [ORG NPC Standing Committee  ] just prior to the opening of this year’s legislative session . 
[ORG Liaoning  ] is also focused on Premier Wen Jiabao’s commitment to deal with social issues , particularly those designed to raise living standards and better the people’s livelihood . 
The [MISC Economy: Not By  ] the Numbers ------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Describing some of the challenges he faces as Party Secretary , [PER Li  ] related that despite brisk economic growth of SIPDIS 12.8 percent in 2006 , Liaoning’s income gaps remain severe . 
[ORG Liaoning  ] ranks among the top 10 [MISC Chinese  ] provinces in terms of per capita GDP , yet the number of its urban residents on welfare is among the highest in the country and average urban disposable income is below the national average . 
By contrast , rural disposable incomes are above the national average . 
Even so , incomes for [ORG Liaoning  ] farmers are only half that of urban residents. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) GDP figures are “man-made” and therefore unreliable , [PER Li  ] said . 
When evaluating Liaoning’s economy , he focuses on three figures: 1 ) electricity consumption , which was up 10 percent in [ORG Liaoning  ] last year ; 2 ) volume of rail cargo , which is fairly accurate because fees are charged for each unit of weight ; and 3 ) amount of loans disbursed , which also tends to be accurate given the interest fees charged . 
By looking at these three figures , [PER Li  ] said he can measure with relative accuracy the speed of economic growth . 
All other figures , especially GDP statistics , are “for reference only , ” he said smiling . 
[ORG Harmonious Society Means Jobs  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In an attempt to create a “harmonious society” in [LOC Liaoning  ] , [PER Li  ] said he has tried to guarantee a minimum standard of living for all residents . 
For example , the province moved over 1.2 million urban slum dwellers into new , heavily government-subsidized apartments over the past two years . 
Premier Wen visited [ORG Liaoning  ] during this past [MISC Chinese  ] New Year Holiday to inspect this program . 
Although the new apartments provide only 40 to 50 square meters to each family , they are far superior to the slums in which residents previously lived . 
The [ORG Central Government  ] provided a great [LOC BEIJING  ] 00001760 002 OF 004 deal of support for this program , with local governments and government-backed loans providing the most of the funding . 
In exchange for a modest amount of money , residents receive the deed to their new homes at a small fraction of the market rate . 
[PER Li  ] said he also guaranteed that every [ORG Liaoning  ] household would have at least one member with a job . 
In 2005 , there were 240,000 provincial households in which not a single family member had work . 
Today there are none , he proudly declared . 
Li’s standing promise is that his government will find a job for every “unemployed household” within 20 days of notification . 
[ORG Governance: Corruption  ] , Public Feedback ---------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Although [ORG Liaoning  ] residents are dissatisfied with education , health care and housing issues , it is corruption that makes them most angry , [PER Li  ] told the Ambassador . 
The most effective way to combat official graft is to create a transparent system of rules and adequate supervision that leaves corrupt officials no room to act . 
This is the method [ORG Liaoning  ] employed to manage the vast sums spent on its massive slum relocation project . 
Once a corrupt official is discovered , he is promptly punished , which provides a good lesson to bureaucrats taking up new posts . 
The province has also increased efforts to “strictly educate” public officials , [PER Li  ] said . 
Part of this education involves prison tours that force bureaucrats to visit incarcerated officials convicted of graft in order to witness first hand the consequences of malfeasance. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) To learn what is on the minds of the public , [PER Li  ] said he uses a variety of channels , official and unofficial . 
These include investigative reports , Li’s own inspection tours of grassroots areas , media reporting and letters addressed directly to him . 
Sometimes , [PER Li  ] uses friends who are not from [ORG Liaoning  ] to gather information about the province that he cannot obtain himself . 
Finally , there are the “official” channels of the [ORG Provincial People’s Congress  ] and [ORG Political Consultative Conference  ] . 
Arguing that these official channels are “highly consultative , ” [PER Li  ] warned against assuming that [ORG People’s Congress  ] deliberations are rigged . 
Although every bill is usually passed with an incredibly high number of “yes” votes , he asserted that people don’t see the behind-the-scenes reviews and feedback sessions that result in the original drafts of bills being altered substantially before passage . 
Rule of Law ----------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [LOC China  ] has made great progress in improving its legal system and implementing the rule of law , said [PER Li  ] , who has a degree in law . 
On the other hand , given that the rule of law has a short history in [LOC China  ] , the country still has a long way to go in “perfecting” its legal system . 
The concept of ruling the country according to law is increasingly becoming rooted in the minds of the people , and there is a recognition that relying on the law allows the government to do its work better and more efficiently . 
At the same time , the government must cope with the challenges of implementing and following the laws passed by the people’s congresses . 
Education --------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Education is crucial for [MISC China’s  ] continued development , [PER Li  ] said . 
The most important task is to increase access to compulsory education . 
Although all [MISC Chinese  ] children are supposed to receive at least nine years of schooling , many do not . 
Even nine years of education is insufficient , [PER Li  ] said , hoping that in the long term this could be extended to 10 or 12 years . 
This year’s [ORG NPC Government Work Report  ] contains two key measures on education . 
The first provides government subsidies covering tuition for poor students , especially in rural areas . 
The second gives totally free schooling to those students majoring in education . 
Referring to [MISC Deng Xiaoping’s  ] appeal to make [MISC Chinese  ] education open to the world , to modernization and to the future , [PER Li  ] said he believes [LOC China  ] has already succeeded in doing so . 
Bilateral Relations , [MISC Six-Party Talks  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) United States-China relations are “developing smoothly , ” [PER Li  ] said , which benefits both of our countries and the entire world . 
He agreed with the [MISC Ambassador’s  ] assessment that our common interests have led to increased cooperation in a number of areas , including on [LOC North Korea  ] . 
[PER Li  ] welcomed the progress achieved in the last round of [MISC Six-Party Talks  ] , [LOC BEIJING  ] 00001760 003 OF 004 noting that , above all , [ORG Liaoning  ] residents hope to see a stable and peaceful [ORG Korean Peninsula  ] . 
[PER Li  ] alleged that he had witnessed no changes in flows of [LOC North Koreans  ] into [ORG Liaoning  ] . 
He believed , however , that the [LOC DPRK  ] has been “strictly controlling” the border . 
Trade Relations: Boosting Domestic Spending -------------------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The Ambassador raised the large trade imbalance between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC China  ] , explaining that one of our priorities in the [ORG Strategic Economic Dialogue  ] ( [ORG SED  ] ) is to encourage [MISC Chinese  ] consumers to spend more by addressing deficiencies in [MISC China’s  ] social safety net and healthcare systems that result in large precautionary savings . 
In reply , [PER Li  ] said [LOC China  ] is committed to boosting domestic consumption and imports , as well as further developing its pension , welfare and healthcare systems . 
[LOC China  ] is doing this , in part , because of its international commitments , including under the [ORG WTO  ] . 
But doing so also clearly promotes [MISC China’s  ] further development in a globalized economy. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [MISC China’s  ] low consumption rates are due , in part , to the [MISC Chinese  ] people’s tradition of frugality and [MISC China’s  ] overall low level of development , [PER Li  ] claimed . 
As [LOC China  ] continues to develop and incomes rise , consumption rates will naturally increase . 
In the past few years , increases in domestic consumption have outstripped GDP growth , a trend that will continue . 
As [MISC Chinese  ] companies continue to grow , they will become strong enough to buy expensive high-end products from overseas , something that is already happening , which was “unthinkable” only 10 years ago . 
[LOC China  ] is also making progress in improving its social safety nets . 
In [LOC Liaoning  ] , all residents are covered under pension and social security systems . 
The problem is that these systems’ standards remain low and must continue to be raised , [PER Li  ] said . 
Free Trade vs. Protectionism ---------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Referring to perceived increased protectionist sentiment on [LOC Capitol Hill  ] , [PER Li  ] said one problem is that Members of [ORG Congress  ] who have never visited [LOC China  ] do not understand the great changes that have taken place here over the past 30 years . 
The best solution is to invite more Members to visit . 
The Ambassador , while emphasizing [MISC American  ] support for free trade , told [PER Li  ] that concern in the [LOC United States  ] over the trade deficit and jobs is real . 
There is a widespread perception in the [LOC United States  ] that [LOC China  ] is not playing fair , especially with respect to the [ORG RMB  ] exchange rate , IPR protection and market access , particularly for services. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Changing tack , [PER Li  ] launched into a spirited defense of free trade . 
If we resort to protectionism , we will all lose , he averred . 
Both [LOC China  ] and the [LOC United States  ] can make protectionist arguments in virtually every sector . 
Even in the financial sector , [LOC China  ] could use the excuse of protecting jobs , not financial security , to lobby against market opening , given the millions of workers in state-owned banks . 
The same holds true for the service , distribution and retail sectors . 
But we cannot resort to protectionism , he emphasized . 
If [LOC China  ] does not open its financial sector , its financial industry will lose competitiveness and the public will be dissatisfied . 
Moreover , [LOC China  ] must play by [ORG WTO  ] rules , which requires market opening . 
Similarly , if [MISC Chinese  ] products are barred from the [LOC United States  ] , the standard of living for most [MISC Americans  ] will be compromised and they will be dissatisfied. “We are in the process of opening up , ” [PER Li  ] said . 
[ORG Congress  ] should keep this in mind when looking at [LOC China  ] , he asserted , reiterating that the [LOC PRC  ] is boosting both domestic consumption and imports . 
[ORG Intel  ] Investment in [LOC Dalian  ] -------------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Regarding export licenses for [MISC Intel’s  ] possible investment in [LOC Dalian  ] ( see reftel ) , the Ambassador told [PER Li  ] that [ORG Intel  ] is working closely with the appropriate government agencies to ensure full compliance with [LOC United States  ] export-control requirements . 
[PER Li  ] was grateful for the information , stressing how important major multinational corporations like [ORG Intel  ] are to Liaoning’s future development . 
More than just the capital invested and the chips produced , [ORG Liaoning  ] hopes to learn from [MISC Intel’s  ] advanced management techniques . 
There will be absolutely no obstacles to the investment on the [MISC Chinese  ] side , as the [ORG Central Government  ] has already approved the investment . 
[MISC Intel’s  ] president will visit [LOC China  ] later this month , and if all goes well , there may be a signing ceremony to finalize the deal , [PER Li  ] said . 
[LOC BEIJING  ] 00001760 004 OF 004 Bio Info -------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [PER Li Keqiang  ] remains one of the front runners to ascend to the [ORG Politburo  ] this fall , perhaps even to the [ORG Politburo Standing Committee  ] , and to succeed [PER Hu Jintao  ] in 2012 . 
With the Ambassador , [PER Li  ] was engaging and well-informed on a wide range of issues . 
He displayed a good sense of humor and appeared relaxed and confident throughout . 
Though coy about his hobbies and interests , [PER Li  ] said he likes to “walk , ” noting that he builds walking into his work schedule and implying that he has little time for other exercise . 
Although he spoke almost entirely in [MISC Chinese  ] , [PER Li  ] clearly understood some [MISC English  ] , correcting his interpreter on several occasions . 
[PER Li  ] expressed an interest in visiting the [LOC United States  ] , noting that his last trip was six years ago , prior to the September 11 attacks . 
On several previous occasions , he traveled widely in the [LOC United States  ] , visiting both coasts and the [LOC Midwest  ] . 
[PER Li  ] said he particularly liked [LOC Oklahoma  ] .
