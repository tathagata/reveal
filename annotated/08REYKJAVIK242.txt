1 . 
( C ) [PER Sturla Palsson  ] , Director of [ORG International Affairs and Markets  ] at the [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG Central Bank  ] and leader of the recent [MISC Icelandic  ] delegation to [LOC Moscow  ] to negotiate a 4 billion [MISC Euro loan  ] from [LOC Russia  ] , told Econoff that the [MISC Russian  ] loan was still very much on the table and that both sides are keeping in telephone and email contact . 
[PER Palsson  ] said the two sides might meet possibly this week , and thought that the loan could be finalized by Friday . 
He said before the [MISC Icelandic  ] delegation left for [LOC Moscow  ] , they had been told by the [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador to [LOC Iceland  ] that the [MISC Russian  ] Prime Minister had signed off on the loan . 
The discussions in [LOC Moscow  ] centered around details such as whether the money would be given as a bond or loan , and what the maturity dates would be , etc . 
The loan would be coming from the [ORG Russian Development Agency  ] . 
[PER Palsson  ] said that [LOC Iceland  ] is considering [ORG IMF  ] assistance and that initially the [MISC Russians  ] had been against [LOC Iceland  ] involving the [ORG IMF  ] " because of the [MISC Russians'  ] own negative experience with the [ORG IMF  ] in 1997 . 
" However , [PER Palsson  ] said that the [MISC Russians  ] could see the business value of involving the [ORG IMF  ] because it could " bring in others " ( presumably other nations with cash ) which could create confidence in the [MISC Icelandic  ] krona and the [MISC Icelandic  ] economy. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Palsson  ] emphasized that the meetings in [LOC Moscow  ] were to inform [LOC Russia  ] what [LOC Iceland  ] planned to do with the 4 billion [MISC Euro .  ] 
He said that it would be used to " kick start things " and provide foreign liquidity . 
With bigger [ORG Central Bank  ] reserves , foreign account holders of [MISC Icelandic  ] krona would be less likely to cash out . 
[PER Palsson  ] acknowledged that [LOC Russia  ] has its own financial problems , especially with the dropping price of oil , but said the [MISC Russian  ] 500+ billion [MISC Euros  ] in reserves would cover an [MISC Icelandic  ] loan . 
Regarding the question of " why ask [LOC Russia  ] for a loan and not the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" , [PER Palsson  ] replied that " feelers " had been put out by the government and only the [MISC Russians  ] responded positively . 
[PER Palsson  ] said that [LOC Iceland  ] had been in discussions with " others " and with sovereign wealth funds and that the feedback has been positive , but did not elaborate further. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Both the Finance Minister and Prime Minister 's offices said that this afternoon 's [ORG FT.com  ] 's article that reported [LOC Iceland  ] 's 6 billion euro [ORG IMF  ] agreement was imminent was unconfirmed . 
The assistant to the Finance Minister said that the Letter of Intent with the [ORG IMF  ] had not yet been signed and that final figures had not been confirmed . 
About an hour later , however , the same assistant emailed Econoff to say that an announcement about the [ORG IMF  ] would be likely made tomorrow. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Comment: Icelanders are aware that a loan from the [MISC Russians  ] may have implications . 
The fact that they are proceeding anyway is an indication of the seriousness of the financial situation here .
