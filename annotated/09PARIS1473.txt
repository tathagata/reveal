( [ORG S/NF  ] ) SUMMARY . 
Madam Secretary , your [ORG Paris Embassy  ] and the [MISC French  ] are eager to welcome you to [LOC France  ] . 
FM [PER Kouchner  ] quickly invited you to lunch or a meeting on Sunday , which is not a usual practice . 
He looks forward to talking with you about key issues , including [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , and relations with [LOC Russia  ] . 
[PER Kouchner  ] recently visited [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and he will undoubtedly be interested in hearing your insights about recent developments there and your views on [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[LOC France  ] is our strongest ally in pursuing a dual track policy with [LOC Iran  ] , and has been helpful in rallying [LOC Europe  ] to a more clear-eyed assessment of [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear ambitions . 
[LOC Paris  ] welcomed the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" reset " with [LOC Russia  ] and views [LOC Moscow  ] as a strategic partner that cannot be ignored . 
End Summary. -------------------- [ORG SARKOZY  ] AND [PER KOUCHNER  ] -------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) FM [PER Kouchner  ] , coming from the opposition [ORG Socialist Party  ] , is regularly polled as one of the most popular [MISC French  ] politicians and is a high-profile example of [PER Sarkozy  ] 's successful policy of outreach to the leaders of other political parties . 
He has a solid working relationship with the demanding [MISC French  ] President . 
[PER Kouchner  ] has also carved out specific areas where he has largely free rein and which play to his strengths and previous experience , including in humanitarian affairs , the [LOC Balkans  ] , and democratization efforts . 
Despite these positives , we have occasionally witnessed lapses in communication between the two offices due to [PER Sarkozy  ] 's tendency to seize the initiative and " speak first , consult later " and his penchant for proposing high-level summits to cut through bureaucratic red tape. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Both [ORG Sarkozy  ] and [PER Kouchner  ] are committed to a strong [LOC Europe  ] with a strong transatlantic relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] Both see [LOC Europe  ] as our closest , most natural partner in fighting terrorism in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and piracy on the high seas , or promoting peace as part of the [LOC Middle East Peace  ] process quartet , fighting [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear weapons ambitions , and in stabilizing the [LOC Balkans  ] . 
Likewise , they view [LOC France  ] , and neighboring [LOC Germany  ] , as the natural leaders of [LOC Europe  ] . 
[PER Kouchner  ] and [PER Sarkozy  ] both have a pragmatic approach to problems , characterized by a high degree of " hands on " personal involvement in the issues that interest them . 
Your visit will give FM [PER Kouchner  ] an opportunity to showcase his close ties to you and to the [PER Obama  ] administration , vindicating [LOC France  ] 's unabashed " pro-American " stance , which is a significant reversal from the [ORG Chirac  ] years when [LOC France  ] defined its power more in opposition to , rather than collaboration with , the [LOC United States.  ] ------------------------------------------- AFGHANISTAN: SAME GOALS , [ORG LIMITED RESOURCES  ] ------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) FM [PER Kouchner  ] was in [LOC Afghanistan  ] on October 17-18 on a " purely political " trip designed to consult with the main presidential candidates and to move the electoral process forward . 
He cooperated closely with Senator [PER Kerry  ] to send a combined message of support for the acceptance of a second round of voting . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] remains a high foreign policy priority for the [MISC French  ] government , but they have difficulty translating their interest into additional concrete military and civilian support . 
[MISC French  ] government officials , including both President [PER Sarkozy  ] and FM [PER Kouchner  ] , have long advocated that " there is no purely military solution " to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
When it comes to putting resources behind the statement , however , the [MISC French  ] government has limited options , due to political maneuvering and real economic constraints . 
As a sop to his own party in exchange for support for [MISC French  ] reintegration into [ORG NATO  ] this April , [PER Sarkozy  ] has publicly and repeatedly promised " not to send one extra soldier " to fight an unpopular war in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
This is now a political line [MISC French  ] leaders will not cross , although their military has privately expressed both the will and the capacity for further contributions . 
To compensate , the GOF is currently shifting some of its troops from a security posture in [LOC Kabul  ] [LOC PARIS  ] 00001473 002.2 OF 004 to more active combat roles in the east , where the bulk of their 3,000 troops are now located . 
In March , President [PER Sarkozy  ] created [LOC France  ] 's first politically-appointed Special Representative to [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] , a post now held by [PER Sarkozy  ] crony UMP deputy [PER Thierry Mariani  ] . 
[PER Kouchner  ] fought this appointment in favor of a career diplomat because political appointments in the [MISC French  ] parliamentary system are limited to six months in length , limiting the effectiveness of the position as it currently functions. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) There is great interest , particularly within the [ORG MFA  ] and from [PER Kouchner  ] personally , to increase [MISC French  ] civilian development assistance to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , with a focus on raising the salaries of [MISC Afghan  ] police and other security forces . 
However , these goals are tempered by very limited resources . 
After a battle with the [ORG Finance Ministry  ] , the [ORG MFA  ] succeeded in restoring [MISC French  ] civilian assistance to [LOC Afghanistan  ] to previous modest levels of 40 million euros ( 58.4 million [LOC U.S.  ] dollars ) after budget cuts threatened to limit [MISC French  ] assistance to only 10 million [MISC Euros  ] this year ( about 14.6 million [LOC U.S.  ] dollars ) . 
One additional area for growth is the deployment by December 1 of the bulk of the 150 [MISC French  ] gendarmes who make up part of the [MISC European  ] [ORG Gendarmerie Force  ] for police training . 
They will be joined soon by [MISC Italian  ] carabinieri and possibly small contributions from other countries in the coming year . 
President [PER Sarkozy  ] is expected to finally take a long-delayed trip to the region next spring. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) In September , the [MISC French  ] President joined his [MISC German  ] and [LOC UK  ] counterparts to propose a conference on [LOC Afghanistan  ] by the end of the year . 
[PER Kouchner  ] wanted to bring other Foreign Ministers to [LOC Paris  ] to meet you to pursue this [MISC European  ] goal . 
[MISC French  ] officials have since stated that if the security situation allows , they would like the conference to take place in [LOC Kabul  ] as soon as possible , with a possible second session taking place later , after the [MISC Afghan  ] government is better able to prioritize its work plan and strategy. -------------------------------------- PAKISTAN: COIN AND CIVILIAN LOANS -------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) On [LOC Pakistan  ] , the [MISC French  ] are relative newcomers who have requested close cooperation with the [LOC UK  ] and [LOC United States  ] , particularly in areas of counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency assistance . 
[LOC France  ] is providing military assistance and security cooperation to [LOC Pakistan  ] , in addition to civilian emergency and humanitarian aid . 
[LOC Paris  ] officials complain that [MISC Pakistani  ] cooperation in combating the [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Taliban  ] refuged in their country is weak , if not non-existent . 
[LOC France  ] has given about five million euros ( 7.3 million [LOC U.S.  ] dollars ) in emergency and reconstruction assistance to [LOC Pakistan  ] this year . 
[LOC France  ] has also increased its concessionary loan commitments to [LOC Pakistan  ] since the April [LOC Tokyo  ] conference from 200 to 382 million euros ( 573 million [LOC U.S.  ] dollars ) . 
The loans cover nine projects in the areas of hydroelectricity and energy efficiency . 
[LOC France  ] is still also dispensing funds made under soft loans worth 11 million euros ( 16 million [LOC U.S.  ] dollars ) for post-earthquake reconstruction ; it is not yet ready to contribute to the [MISC World Bank-administered  ] multi-donor trust fund for [LOC Pakistan  ] as it was not clear who their partners on the [MISC Pakistani  ] side would be and what safeguards there would be over the funds. -------------------------------------- IRAN: FEARS THAT WE ARE LOSING GROUND -------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) In their October 14 phone call , Presidents [PER Sarkozy  ] and [PER Obama  ] agreed that if [LOC Iran  ] responds negatively to the uranium enrichment deal on the table , then we must take more serious measures , including additional sanctions . 
Senior [MISC French  ] officials believe that we are losing traction on this issue within the international community , as countries continue to engage in normal diplomatic and commercial relations with [LOC Iran  ] ( exemplified by [MISC Chinese  ] business interests , [MISC Turkish  ] PM [PER Erdogan  ] 's recent visit to [LOC Iran  ] , and [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Ahmedinejad  ] 's planned trip to [LOC Brazil  ] in late November ) . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] 's position is bolstered by his staunch [LOC PARIS  ] 00001473 003.2 OF 004 belief in non-proliferation ( to maintain [LOC France  ] 's own deterrent capability ) , his real concern about the threat to [LOC Israel  ] , and his personal ire at the way [LOC Iran  ] has tried to manipulate [LOC France  ] , including by holding [MISC French  ] citizen [PER Clotilde Reiss  ] and [MISC Franco-Iranian  ] dual national [PER Nazak Afshar  ] for alleged illegal participation in this summer 's street protests . 
Some senior [MISC French  ] officials have suggested that [PER Sarkozy  ] 's tough line can be useful as " the pointy edge of the sword " in meeting the [MISC Iranian  ] challenge . 
As we plan next steps on [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Kouchner  ] will likely be interested in your readout of your recent discussions in [LOC Moscow  ] as well as the latest efforts to bring [LOC China  ] on board. ------------------------------------------ PUSHING ENGAGEMENT WITH [LOC RUSSIA  ] ------------------------------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) [MISC French  ] policy toward [LOC Russia  ] under President [PER Sarkozy  ] reflects the belief that engagement with [LOC Moscow  ] is the best way to influence [MISC Russian  ] behavior . 
[LOC Paris  ] has welcomed [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to " re-set " relations with [LOC Russia  ] and has consistently emphasized developing a common approach with [LOC Washington  ] toward [LOC Moscow  ] . 
[MISC French  ] officials maintain that dialogue must underpin our efforts to elicit [LOC Moscow  ] 's cooperation ; this is particularly true on [MISC European  ] security , an area in which [PER Sarkozy  ] -- who last year proposed an [ORG OSCE  ] summit on the issue -- seeks to exert [MISC French  ] leadership . 
[MISC French  ] priorities for strategic dialogue with [LOC Moscow  ] include promoting economic cooperation ; encouraging [LOC Russia  ] to work through institutions with set rules ; supporting [MISC Russian  ] actions in public while taking a more honest approach in private meetings ; and cultivating relations with [MISC Russian  ] President [PER Dmitri Medvedev  ] , in the hope that he can become a leader independent of [PER Vladimir Putin  ] . 
[PER Putin  ] is due in [LOC Paris  ] later this month , [PER Sarkozy  ] will go to [LOC Moscow  ] in February , and [PER Medvedev  ] will visit [LOC France  ] in March 2010. ----------------------------------------- AN URGENT FOCUS ON CLIMATE CHANGE ----------------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC French  ] remain divided on how to respond to the [ORG Obama Administration  ] 's approaches to climate change . 
Most of the interested public and many in the government believe that interim 2020 reduction targets , and the level of greenhouse gas ( [ORG GHG  ] ) emissions and concentrations at that time , will determine success or failure in slowing global warming . 
For them , the [ORG EU  ] 's target of 20 to 30 percent reductions below 1990 is the sole measure of an acceptable policy . 
Even sophisticated observers are skeptical that long-term reduction goals legislated in the [LOC United States  ] can be counted on as more than aspirations , especially if radical cuts are not imposed up front . 
We have reiterated that [LOC U.S.  ] laws are reliably enforced by the [ORG Federal  ] government and by [LOC U.S.  ] courts , using the [MISC Clean Air Act  ] as our example . 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials agree that legislation moving through [ORG Congress  ] and the [ORG Administration  ] 's proposals would establish a system comparable to the [ORG EU  ] 's measures . 
These officials regard Environment Minister [PER Jean-Louis Borloo  ] 's public criticisms of [MISC Waxman-Markey  ] as " insufficient on the medium term goal " as distracting attention from the need for [LOC China  ] and [LOC India  ] to reduce their rates of growth in [ORG GHG  ] emissions. ------------------------------------------ WANTS TO BE A PLAYER IN THE MIDDLE EAST ------------------------------------------ <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The [ORG GOF  ] is eager to engage with the [LOC United States  ] on the [LOC Middle East  ] peace process and worries we are not moving fast enough . 
President [PER Sarkozy  ] and FM [PER Kouchner  ] continue to press for a [LOC Middle East  ] peace summit before the end of the year , to be held under the auspices of the Union for the [MISC Mediterranean  ] , of which [LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC France  ] are currently co-chairs . 
A sense of frustration and ambition informs the [MISC French  ] approach toward the [LOC Middle East  ] peace process: they are frustrated that they must rely on the [ORG USG  ] and on stubborn parties in the region to end a conflict whose persistence adversely affects their national interests , and they are ambitious to play a larger role in the peace process , in order to facilitate a successful outcome and to enjoy the prestige that such a role would earn them . 
As a case in point , last week [PER Kouchner  ] had to cancel a planned visit to [LOC Israel  ] and the [MISC Palestinian  ] territories in part because of the continuing tension there , and in part because of [LOC Israel  ] 's refusal to allow him [LOC PARIS  ] 00001473 004.2 OF 004 to visit a [MISC French  ] hospital in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
Nonetheless , aside from their criticism of the pace at which we have proceeded with negotiations , [MISC French  ] officials continue to take concrete steps to support our efforts to broker peace among the various states and groups in the region: they have consistently affirmed our leadership role in their own bilateral contacts , in multilateral fora , and in public and private statements. --------------------------------------------- ------ INCREASING CONCERNS ABOUT [LOC U.S.  ] FOCUS ON DISARMAMENT --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) [MISC French  ] officials are increasingly concerned that the [MISC Obama  ] administration 's commitment to an eventual " world free of nuclear weapons " represents a divergence from the [MISC French  ] position on a strong deterrence policy . 
Furthermore , they worry that a focus on disarmament goals by legitimate nuclear weapons states will pressure them to cut their own modest arsenal and will serve as a distraction from serious proliferation concerns by states like [LOC North Korea  ] and [LOC Iran  ] . 
The [ORG GOF  ] would like to use every available forum , including the 2010 [ORG NPT Review Conference  ] , to strongly and specifically rebuke [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC North Korea  ] ( and were greatly disappointed by our decision not to do so at the September 24 UNSC summit ) . 
Additionally , [LOC France  ] is " psychologically " committed to a deterrent force as a symbol of its strategic independence and they will strive to maintain the " legitimacy " of nuclear weapons as a key element of military strategy . 
Any suggestion that bilateral [MISC U.S.-Russian  ] arms reduction talks should eventually include other nuclear powers , or that an FMCT should address existing stockpiles , are absolute redlines for the [MISC French.  ] ------------------------------------- A PARTNER IN [LOC AFRICA  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) [LOC France  ] is struggling somewhat to implement [PER Sarkozy  ] 's vision of a new approach to [LOC Africa  ] , in part because of recent governance crises in a number of [MISC Francophone  ] countries , including [LOC Mauritania  ] , [LOC Gabon  ] , [LOC Madagascar  ] , [LOC Niger  ] , and [LOC Guinea  ] , where the need for expediency in bringing stability can sometimes trump loftier principles . 
We are still waiting to see if [LOC France  ] will , in fact close down one of its military bases on the [LOC Atlantic  ] side , in [LOC Senegal  ] or [LOC Gabon  ] in an effort to streamline its presence in [LOC Africa  ] . 
That said , [LOC France  ] is a progressively more open interlocutor on [LOC Africa  ] and there are many areas where we are working closely , including pushing for a transitional government in [LOC Guinea  ] , supporting efforts to deter sexual violence , and , increasingly , coordinating on addressing the [ORG AQIM  ] threat in [LOC Mali  ] and [LOC Mauritania  ] . 
The [ORG MFA  ] 's initial response to our new [LOC Sudan  ] strategy is positive . 
[LOC France  ] , as the leader of the [ORG EU  ] 's anti piracy effort off the [LOC Horn of Africa  ] is an important partner on counter-piracy and maritime security issues .
