[LOC BERLIN  ] 1167 Classified By: DCM [PER Greg T. Delawie  ] for Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: [MISC German  ] Federal Interior Minister [PER Thomas de Maiziere  ] overruled Justice Minister [PER Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger  ] and abstained from voting at the November 30 COREPER vote in [LOC Brussels  ] on an interim [MISC U.S.-EU  ] agreement to continue the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program . 
[PER De Maiziere  ] 's decision allowed the agreement to pass and followed weeks of engagement in [LOC Berlin  ] , [LOC Brussels  ] and [LOC Washington  ] as well as high-level interventions from Secretary [PER Clinton  ] , Treasury Secretary [PER Geithner  ] , Attorney General Holder , [ORG National Security Advisor  ] Gen. [PER Jones  ] and Ambassador [PER Murphy  ] . 
[PER De Maiziere  ] 's decision was difficult for him to make given that the coalition agreement called for specific revisions to the SWIFT agreement , none of which [LOC Germany  ] achieved , except a shortening of the interim period from 12 to 9 months . 
The episode has tested [LOC Germany  ] 's new coalition government just weeks after its formation with [PER Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger  ] heavily criticizing the abstention . 
This experience suggests that we will need to pay close attention to [LOC Germany  ] during our negotiations on a long-term [ORG TFTP  ] agreement . 
END SUMMARY [LOC Germany  ] Relents Following Intense Pressure --------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Murphy  ] met with Interior Minister [PER de Maiziere  ] on November 27 and urged him to support [MISC U.S.-EU  ] negotiations on an interim [ORG TFTP  ] agreement , to which de [PER Maiziere  ] indicated that he would abstain from voting on the agenda item at the November 30 COREPER meeting . 
[PER De Maiziere  ] 's decision , which followed a [MISC German  ] request to shorten the duration of the interim agreement to nine months rather than twelve , facilitated the passing of the agreement as [LOC Germany  ] was the strongest holdout . 
[PER De Maiziere  ] 's decision followed two weeks of intense lobbying in [LOC Berlin  ] , [LOC Brussels  ] and [LOC Washington  ] by Embassy [LOC Berlin  ] , USEU , the [ORG Departments of Treasury  ] , State and Justice and the [ORG NSC  ] . 
The campaign included calls by [PER Secretaries Clinton  ] , [PER Geithner  ] , the Attorney General and the [ORG National Security Advisor  ] to their [MISC German  ] counterparts . 
[ORG State Department Counterterrorism Coordinator  ] [PER Benjamin  ] urged support for the agreement during a two-day visit to [LOC Berlin  ] ( see septel ) . 
Ambassador [PER Murphy  ] twice wrote to all five relevant ministers ( Interior , Justice , Finance , [PER Chancellery  ] , and [ORG MFA  ] ) and made repeated calls to senior decision makers , stressing the importance of the interim agreement and the need for [LOC Germany  ] to not block it . 
The DCM , Econ M/C , and staff from multiple embassy sections heavily engaged on the issue as well. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER De Maiziere  ] ( [ORG CDU  ] ) stressed that his decision was not an easy one given that the [ORG Christian Democrat/Social Union  ] ( [ORG CDU/CSU  ] ) and [ORG Free Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG FDP  ] ) coalition had differing views on the [ORG TFTP  ] program . 
The outcome particularly irritated Justice Minister [PER Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger  ] because she had expressed concerns about the [ORG TFTP  ] dating back to the initial July decision to give the negotiating mandate to the [MISC Swedish  ] [ORG EU  ] Presidency . 
Furthermore , in October [PER Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger  ] had inserted language into the CDU/CSU-FDP coalition agreement specifically addressing the [ORG TFTP  ] negotiations and directing [LOC Germany  ] to call upon the [ORG EU  ] to work towards a higher level of data protection ( see Ref B ) . 
Following de [PER Maiziere  ] 's decision , the Justice Minister complained that her views were ignored and that the decision has " upset millions of citizens of [LOC Europe  ] . 
" [PER De Maiziere  ] told the Ambassador that he would be expressing some criticisms of the agreement publicly in order to reflect MoI concerns and to deflect public criticism . 
He was subsequently quoted as saying that " a not completely satisfactory agreement is better than none at all . 
" [LOC BERLIN  ] 00001528 002 OF 002 [MISC German  ] Vote Comes with Costs for the Coalition ---------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER De Maiziere  ] intimated , and working level contacts have confirmed , that [LOC Germany  ] would like to avoid a repeat of our all-out lobbying effort during the negotiations for a long-term [ORG TFTP  ] agreement . 
[PER De Maiziere  ] 's strong preference is to seek consensus with his ministry colleagues . 
He particularly wants to avoid another clash with the Justice Minister on this issue as it has caused no small amount of discord between the new coalition partners , who are having a rocky start on a number of fronts . 
The incident is particularly difficult for de [PER Maiziere  ] as he entered the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] stressing that he represented a break from his predecessor [PER Wolfgang Schaeuble  ] , whom he felt overly focused on security issues ( see Ref A ) . 
[PER De Maiziere  ] surely finds this whole experience regrettable as it put him in exactly the position he did not want to be in: seemingly siding with the [LOC U.S.  ] over [MISC German  ] interests , causing disruption within the coalition , and compromising the data privacy rights of [MISC German  ] citizens . 
Engaging the [ORG FDP  ] on [ORG Data Privacy  ] --------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) It is not altogether surprising that this disagreement arose given the [ORG FDP  ] 's reputation as a staunch defender of citizens' privacy rights ( see Ref C ) . 
Nevertheless , the intensity of this dispute should be a wake up call - we must avoid repeating this as we look to completing the long-term [MISC U.S.-EU  ] [ORG TFTP  ] agreement . 
The coalition agreement calls for strict limitations on the use of [ORG TFTP  ] data , no automatic access to the system , data deletion requirements , clear rules on sharing information with third parties and legal redress . 
These positions will guide [LOC Germany  ] 's views in the follow-on negotiations , and we need to consider how to take them into account in a way that does not complicate [ORG TFTP  ] implementation. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Embassy [LOC Berlin  ] is examining how we can reach out to [ORG FDP  ] ministers and parliamentarians to educate them on [LOC U.S.  ] data protection structures as this experience has demonstrated that they are often misinformed on the nature of our policies . 
We will likewise reach out to [ORG CDU/CSU  ] decision makers , in part to enlist their help in reaching the [MISC German  ] public . 
We also intend to make the point that countering terrorism in a globalized world , where terrorists and their supporters use open borders and information technology to quickly move people and financing , requires robust international data sharing .
