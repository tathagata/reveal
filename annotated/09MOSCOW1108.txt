[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] attributed the [MISC DPRK  ] , s recent currency reform to several factors: controlling rampant inflation , preventing 'hot money' flows , leveling the wealth gap between workers and traders , controlling domestic currency , and most importantly , uncovering potential political opposition . 
As a result of the reform , commerce has come to a halt . 
The leadership , as part of an ambitious 2012 development strategy , hopes for the restoration of relations with the [LOC United States  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also believes that current plans assume [PER Kim Jong-il  ] will be around for some time and that [PER Kim Jong-un  ] will be his successor . 
The recent recall of [MISC DPRK  ] scholars , students and scientists from [LOC China  ] following the defection of a [MISC North Korean  ] exchange student , for example , suggests increasing levels of paranoia . 
END SUMMARY . 
GIVE ME GOOD REASON ------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) On December 15 , [PER EAP  ] DAS [PER David Shear  ] and Consulate [ORG Shenyang  ] staff met with [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] visits [LOC Pyongyang  ] frequently . 
Admitting he is unsure of the exact value of [MISC Chinese  ] investment into [LOC North Korea  ] , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believes the number to be many billions of renminbi . 
[MISC Chinese  ] companies , like their [ORG ROK  ] counterparts , use [LOC North Korea  ] as a processing zone , primarily in the mining and seafood industries . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , the [MISC DPRK  ] leadership 's 2012 target for achieving 's trong-country' status should form the principal basis for analyzing recent political developments , including the currency reform measure. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The most important reason for the recent [MISC DPRK  ] currency reform , according to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , is to uncover political opposition , particularly against [PER Kim Jong-il  ] 's younger son . 
Controlling inflation , leveling the wealth gap , controlling domestic currency and access to foreign currency , are all part of this strategy . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believes that the third son , [PER Kim Jong-un  ] , favored the currency revaluation , and that going forward [PER Kim Jong-un  ] leans toward a Vietnamese-style of economic reform . 
Opposition to the currency exchange , according to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , might reveal who opposes the ascension of [PER Kim Jong-un  ] to leadership . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [PER Kim Jong-il  ] 's support of the currency reform points to his favoring the third son ; those opposing the revaluation , also oppose the third son . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] drew parallels to the 2009 nuclear tests , which he said were also influenced by succession plans . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that the first son , [PER Kim Jong-nam  ] , opposes his younger brother 's reform plans and favors a Chinese-style of economic opening. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that the number of factions competing for [PER Kim Jong-il  ] 's attention have made it increasingly difficult for [PER Kim Jong-il  ] to listen to anyone . 
As a sign of [PER Kim Jong-il  ] 's paranoia , he recently recalled all students , scholars , and scientists in [LOC China  ] following the defection of an exchange student in [LOC Northeast China  ] . 
He did this despite the need for [MISC Chinese  ] knowledge , production skills , and technology to achieve the country 's goals for 2012 . 
However , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believes that current instability will settle and the government will move ahead with reform , fully expecting [PER Kim Jong-il  ] to be around for sometime to come . 
The reform , according to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , may not be toward a more open economy . 
Rather , with currency reform giving the regime the ability to control domestic currency , reforms will lead to tighter control over the economy. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) Prior to revaluation , one dollar equaled 3500 won . 
To put that in perspective , the average worker in [LOC Pyongyang  ] earns 3000-4000 won per month . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] reported that according to the [MISC DPRK Embassy  ] , the official exchange rate following reform is now one dollar equals 129 won . 
For the common person , [ORG SHENYANG  ] 00000004 002 OF 002 besides suffering from a significant cut in won-based savings , supermarkets and department stores that deal in won have suspended activity as they wait to see what impact currency reform will have on commodity prices . 
Thus , it has become difficult to purchase day-to-day needs . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] pointed out , if commodity prices rise , the economy will be ruined . 
However , if prices settle as a result of reform , and assuming constant wages , the economy will be okay as workers once earning one dollar a month will now earn nearly 20 dollars. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) Traders , who earn many times more than the average wage-earner , have been unaffected by the reform in monetary terms , as savings are held mostly in euro and dollars . 
Since the revaluation , only stores dealing with foreign exchange have been open and prices in these stores have increased 400-500 percent . 
For example , a TV that cost [ORG RMB  ] 4000 now costs [ORG RMB  ] 20,000 . 
Many of these stores raised prices in anticipation of the reform , with the expectation that prices would then fall . 
However , prices have not fallen . 
Many of the stores that raised prices prior to reform have since been closed by the government , their goods confiscated . 
Thus , even traders who have not lost money from revaluation now have nothing to buy . 
[MISC Chinese  ] traders along the [MISC North Korean  ] border have also been affected by currency reform even though most trade is done in euros and dollars . 
As is the case within [LOC North Korea  ] , people are waiting and watching to see what will happen to prices . 
In the meantime , nobody wants to sell anything . 
NOT A CRISIS YET BUT CLOSE -------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] does not believe the [MISC DPRK  ] is in crisis mode at this time . 
As he said , the people are used to this sort of thing . 
He saw the currency reform as being part of a broader conflict within the government as it moves forward in the next several years . 
Since 2002 , the [ORG DPRK  ] has allowed some economic reform , without expressing strong support or opposition . 
As he put it , the government has been waiting and watching to see what would happen . 
[LOC CHINA  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] , and EVERYTHING ------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said many in the [ORG DPRK  ] believe the [MISC Chinese  ] do not understand their country . 
While neither the [MISC Chinese  ] nor the [ORG DPRK  ] are likely to criticize the other in public , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that in private the [ORG DPRK  ] has disparaged the [MISC Chinese  ] for not including [LOC North Korea  ] on its list of 147 tourist destinations or 137 investment destinations . 
These omissions and the disparate [MISC Chinese  ] actions on regional development projects clearly indicate that [LOC North Korea  ] is not a priority for the [MISC Chinese  ] . 
For instance , while [LOC China  ] recently elevated the long-beleaguered [LOC Changchun-Jilin-Tumen River  ] development plan to a national level project , the [ORG DPRK  ] left the [LOC Tumen River Development Plan  ] , as it sees no benefit ( [ORG REFTEL  ] ) . 
Relations between the two countries were getting so bad , in fact , Premier [PER Wen Jiabao  ] visited [LOC Pyongyang  ] two months ahead of schedule. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [LOC North Korea  ] has set an ambitious target of developing a strong country by 2012 . 
As part of this project , it is planning to build 100,000 residential apartments in [LOC Pyongyang  ] by 2012 . 
In order to encourage [MISC Chinese  ] investment , the [ORG DPRK  ] is offering [MISC Chinese  ] investors mining and ocean rights for their injection of cash into the project . 
A former Consul General of the [MISC North Korean  ] consulate in [LOC Shenyang  ] , recently spent two weeks in [LOC Beijing  ] attracting about [ORG RMB  ] 12 billion for this project and planned to come to [LOC Shenyang  ] following his time in [LOC Beijing.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) Restoration of relations with the [LOC United States  ] is another important part of the [ORG DPRK  ] 's reform plans . 
He said , however , that [LOC North Korea  ] looks forward to an ongoing cycle of ups and downs in negotiations and that it counts on the [ORG U.N.  ] to be slow in implementing sanctions . 
As he said , he believes that once things settle down , [LOC North Korea  ] will show [LOC China  ] and the [LOC U.S  ] .
