( C ) [PER Summary: Castro  ] has reduced his public profile since February , but rumors of debilitating ill health are unfounded . 
[MISC Russian  ] officials who met with him last week described [PER Castro  ] as " lively . 
" In contrast , [PER Raul Castro  ] wears a back brace and appears to be in worse physical condition than his elder brother . 
Rumors are running wild that [PER Vilma Espin  ] , [PER Raul Castro  ] 's wife , is near death and that a grand burial is in preparation . 
( [PER Vilma  ] is a prominent figurehead , and her death will be treated with the solemnity accorded to a revolutionary commander . 
) [PER Eusebio Leal  ] , the " Mayor " of [LOC Old Havana  ] , has also been ill for some time , but recently appeared publicly at a diplomatic reception and art show . 
End Summary . 
[PER Castro  ] ( Relatively ) Quiet ------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Castro  ] watchers note the [PER Comandante  ] has ramped down public speeches since his last marathon presentation on January 19-21 ( three nights of television appearances to discuss the " Year of the Energy Revolution " ) ( ref A ) . 
Other than an appearance on the evening talk show " The [LOC Round Table  ] " excoriating [PER Posada Carriles  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] Interests Section , [PER Castro  ] 's speech topics have been low key: Information technology ( before a visibly bored student audience ) ; primary education ; sports ; the 44th anniversary of the [ORG Union of Communist Youth  ] ; and last night 's commemoration of the [ORG Battle of Giron  ] ( [LOC Bay of Pigs  ] ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Castro  ] does not appear to have met with [ORG Nation of Islam  ] leader [ORG Farrukhan  ] during his April visit ( ref B ) , though he has feted other " luminaries " -- for example , he presented the [PER Jose Marti Prize  ] to [PER Hugo Chavez  ] on February <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
Today , April 20 , [PER Castro  ] is expected to receive visiting [MISC Belarusian  ] Prime Minister [PER Sergey Sidorskiy.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Castro  ] 's relatively subdued public profile initially sparked ( once again ) rumors of ill health , but they are unfounded . 
[MISC Russian  ] officials at a signing ceremony for the purchase of five passenger aircraft last week spent several hours with [PER Castro  ] and described him as " lively and lucid . 
" Other foreign visitors have made similar observations . 
Instead , [PER Castro  ] 's low profile may have been encouraged by nervous [PER Castro  ] aides looking to " turn down the volume " in expectation of hot weather , associated power outages and an irritated populace ( ref B ) . 
[PER Castro  ] spent so many successive nights on TV during the hot summer of 2005 with its interminable power shortages that the [MISC Cuban  ] public began to ridicule him openly , demanding a more dependable electrical current - along with their prime time sports and soap operas. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In contrast to his elder brother , [PER Raul Castro  ] is ageing badly . 
[MISC Japanese  ] Ambassador [PER Iwata  ] told [ORG COM  ] that conversations with regime insiders indicate the younger brother is in worse physical shape than [PER Fidel  ] . 
According to [PER Iwata  ] , [PER Raul  ] wears a back brace almost constantly at present , and is reportedly in serious pain much of the time from an undisclosed ailment . 
Vespers for [PER Vilma  ] ----------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Even worse off is [PER Raul  ] 's wife , [PER Vilma Espin Guillois de Castro  ] , who is reportedly on her death bed . 
USINT officials have heard the rumor that she was dead or near death from five sources , and two of whom went so far as to suggest that [PER Espin  ] was already dead and being kept " on ice " until after ( or perhaps during ) the [ORG GOC  ] 's May Day celebrations . 
On the other hand , [ORG Reuters  ] journalist [PER Marc Frank  ] said [PER Espin  ] has been ill for some time and had called her friends up to a year ago to bid a final adieu . 
It seems [PER Vilma  ] has spent a long time " on her death bed . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) In any event , [PER Vilma  ] 's departure from the scene will be a significant event for the [ORG GOC  ] . 
According to [PER Frank  ] , her funeral will serve as a useful " trial run " for the big day ( [PER Fidel  ] 's death ) . 
Dissident [PER Martha Beatriz Roque  ] heard a grand burial site was under preparation in [LOC Holguin HAVANA  ] 00008633 002 OF 002 Province. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Vilma Espin  ] is a key public figure . 
She is not only [PER Raul  ] 's wife , but [PER Fidel  ] 's ceremonial [ORG First Lady  ] and Head of the [MISC Cuban  ] Women 's Federation . 
She is not , however , a political power and has served mostly as a shining example of womanly revolutionary values ( similar to " Mother of the Revolution " [PER Celia Sanchez  ] , who died in 1980 ) . 
More relevant female figures in the [ORG GOC  ] include [PER Maria del Carmen Concepcion  ] , a regional leader in [LOC Pinar  ] del [LOC Rio  ] , and Minister of [ORG Basic Industries Yadira Garcia  ] . 
End Comment . 
[PER Eusebio  ] 's Illness ----------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Eusebio Leal  ] , the so-called " Mayor of [LOC Old Havana  ] , " has been rumored to be sick ( possibly with diabetes ) for some time . 
A [MISC Dutch  ] hotel manager reported that restoration projects in [LOC Old Havana  ] had stalled as a result . 
A [MISC Cuban  ] project manager for [PER Habaguanex  ] ( [PER Leal  ] 's organization ) , confirmed [PER Leal  ] 's illness to P/E officer but denied that restoration in [LOC Old Havana  ] had suffered . 
She said the projects had been going on long enough that [PER Leal  ] 's staff was perfectly capable of running the show . 
( Comment: This might be true in the short run , but [PER Leal  ] is both the brains and the political brawn behind the restoration of [LOC Old Havana  ] and his influence with [PER Castro  ] is exceptional . 
End Comment . 
) Despite his ill health , [PER Leal  ] attended a [MISC Mexican  ] diplomatic reception and art show earlier this week and did not betray any obvious frailties other than some weight loss and a display of his well- established short temper - he was seen berating two subordinates after the [MISC Mexican  ] event .
