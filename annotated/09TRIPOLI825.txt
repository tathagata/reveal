( C ) Summary: [PER Ali Sugheir  ] , the current head of [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG National Oil Company  ] , clarified that he was still the Acting Chairman of the [ORG NOC  ] ; a recent [MISC Libyan  ] Government decree simply formalized his acting status . 
[PER Sugheir  ] plans to follow the policies of his predecessor , [PER Shokri Ghanem  ] , continuing with the conversion of all IOCs' contracts to [MISC EPSA  ] IV contracts , and casting a recent decree requiring foreign companies to hire " regional managers " as an attempt to address [MISC Libyan  ] unemployment problems . 
[PER Sugheir  ] dismissed reports that the new [ORG Supreme Council for Energy  ] would affect the [ORG NOC  ] 's operations , stating that it was simply an expansion of a previous council . 
[PER Sugheir  ] also reaffirmed the [ORG NOC  ] 's partnership with [ORG PetroCanada  ] , stating that recent production cuts were due to [ORG OPEC  ] quotas and had also affected [MISC Libyan-owned  ] companies . 
[PER Sugheir  ] stressed , as he had in a previous meeting with emboffs , that the change in leadership would not affect the [ORG NOC  ] 's daily operations . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On October 13 , the Ambassador met with [PER Ali Sugheir  ] , the current head of [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG National Oil Company  ] ( [ORG NOC  ] ) . 
[PER Sugheir  ] clarified that he was still serving as the Acting Chairman of the [ORG NOC  ] and had not been officially approved as [PER Shokri Ghanem  ] 's permanent replacement ; the recent decree on the [ORG NOC  ] website simply formalized [PER Sugheir  ] 's acting status ( Ref A ) . 
He had no idea how long he would remain in the position . 
( Note: Some industry insiders believe the General People 's [ORG Congress  ] would need to officially approve [PER Sugheir  ] as Chairman , but its next regular meeting is not expected until March 2010 . 
End note ) . 
Reiterating a theme he expressed in a recent meeting with PolEcon Chief , [PER Sugheir  ] said , " it 's business as usual at the [ORG NOC  ] , " and that he and his colleagues were working as a team ( Ref B ) . 
Perhaps as a demonstration of the team approach , [PER Sugheir  ] invited to our meeting several of his colleagues from the [ORG NOC Management Committee  ] , including: [PER Azzam Eli Elmesallati  ] , in charge of Investment and [ORG Joint Ventures  ] ; [PER Ahmed al-Ghabir  ] , Advisor to the [ORG Management Committee  ] ; [PER Abdelgazem Shanguir  ] , General Manager for Exploration and Production ; and [PER Ahmed Taghdi  ] , Director for [ORG International Cooperation and Energy Information  ] . 
[ORG SUPREME COUNCIL FOR ENERGY AFFAIRS  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Sugheir  ] said that the new " [ORG Supreme Council for Energy Affairs  ] " headed by PM-equivalent [ORG Al-Baghdadi  ] al-Mahmoudi was simply an expansion of the previous [ORG Supreme Council for Oil and Gas  ] . 
The new council would have added responsibility for policies governing renewable energy and nuclear energy . 
[PER Sugheir  ] argued that the new council would not affect the [ORG NOC  ] , as the [ORG NOC  ] would still fall under the General People 's [ORG Committee  ] ( [ORG Cabinet-equivalent  ] ) . 
The intent of the new council , he said , was to place all energy-related departments and staff under one structure . 
NEW REQUIREMENT FOR FOREIGN FIRMS TO BE HEADED BY [MISC LIBYAN  ] MANAGERS <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Sugheir  ] said that a recent decree requiring foreign companies to hire " regional managers " was an attempt to address unemployment in [LOC Libya  ] , including many unemployed college graduates . 
He said the [ORG NOC  ] had recently sent a " secret committee " to visit oil operations in the [MISC Libyan  ] desert and conduct an employment study . 
The committee found that 80 percent of young engineers working in the oil industry were not [MISC Libyan  ] but were from neighboring countries . 
However , he commented that , as a practical matter , the [ORG NOC  ] was " busy with many other things " and had not focused on enforcing the requirement for a [MISC Libyan  ] top manager in the [LOC IOCs.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) When asked how decreasing world oil prices would affect [LOC Libya  ] 's plans , [PER Sugheir  ] said [LOC Libya  ] was " always going forward " and did not envision the return of the days of cheap oil . 
The [ORG NOC  ] had just received approval from the [ORG GPC  ] for a $12 billion investment plan for the next five years . 
It would focus on exploration and also include investments in developing fields operated by NOC-owned companies such as [MISC African Gulf Oil Company  ] ( " [MISC AGOCO  ] " ) and [ORG Sirte Oil Company  ] ( which [PER Sugheir  ] used to run ) . 
While the overall focus would be on the [MISC Upstream  ] side of the industry , investments in the " [MISC Mid-stream  ] " would improve the pipeline networks . 
[PER Sugheir  ] noted [LOC Libya  ] 's goal of reaching a production of 3 million barrels per day by 2013 was still the target , and " maybe more . 
" [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000825 002.2 OF 002 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Turning to the Exploration and Production Sharing Agreements ( EPSAs ) , [PER Sugheir  ] said the [ORG NOC  ] hoped to align all its foreign partners under [ORG EPSA  ] IV agreements . 
He said almost all partners had done so but that [ORG Wintershall  ] ( [MISC German  ] ) and the [ORG Waha Group  ] ( [LOC US  ] firms [LOC Marathon  ] , [ORG Amerada Hess  ] , and [ORG ConocoPhillips  ] ) had not converted to [ORG EPSA  ] IV contracts . 
He characterized the [ORG EPSA  ] IV system as a " happy medium for a working partnership " that was a " win-win " situation for both the [ORG NOC  ] and its partners . 
He noted the [ORG NOC  ] had accomplished moving to [ORG EPSA  ] with the other major [MISC IOCs  ] , which " created more comfort on our side , " alleviating the [MISC Libyans'  ] concerns that the [MISC IOCs  ] would " take more than they should . 
" GAS SECTOR IN NEED OF NEW TECHNOLOGY AND INVESTMENTS <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The Ambassador asked whether the [ORG NOC  ] was developing a national strategy for gas production , to which [PER Sugheir  ] replied that the [ORG GPC  ] had requested the [ORG NOC  ] create a policy for the domestic market . 
Presently , the [ORG NOC  ] uses the international pricing model , but it is still under debate in [LOC Libya  ] whether to separate the international and domestic markets . 
[PER Azzam Ali Elmesallati  ] ( Investment and [ORG Joint Ventures  ] ) added that [LOC Libya  ] did not yet produce very much gas and most of what it did produce went to the domestic market . 
He said that , under sanctions in the 1990s , [LOC Libya  ] had been unable to upgrade its gas technology , but in the past five years the [ORG NOC  ] has invested in new pipelines and revamping the gas sector . 
[ORG VERENEX  ] AND PETROCANADA: [MISC LIBYAN  ] REVENGE ON [MISC CANADIAN  ] COMPANIES ? <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The Ambassador raised the issue of the recent experiences of [MISC Canadian  ] oil companies [ORG Verenex  ] and [ORG PetroCanada  ] , noting that other firms -- including from the [LOC U.S.  ] , -- were concerned about the apparent inconsistencies in how standard business practices are applied in [LOC Libya  ] ( Ref C ) . 
This has led to the impression that [LOC Libya  ] may not be a safe environment for investments . 
[PER Sugheir  ] replied that one could not compare the cases of [ORG Verenex  ] and [ORG PetroCanada  ] . 
[PER Sugheir  ] denied that [ORG PetroCanada  ] was singled out and said that other NOC-owned companies also had implemented production cuts in order for [LOC Libya  ] to comply with [ORG OPEC  ] 's quota of 1.3 million barrels/day . 
For example , [MISC AGOCO  ] decreased its production by 60,000 b/d and [ORG Sirte Oil Company  ] decreased by 20,000 b/d . 
[PER Sugheir  ] declared " our relationship with [ORG PetroCanada  ] is solid " and " they are our partner . 
" Responding to rumors that expatriate staff of [ORG PetroCanada  ] might be deported , he said as a matter of policy , the [ORG NOC  ] expected foreign companies to try to recruit [MISC Libyans  ] for all positions . 
He noted that some [MISC Libyan  ] university graduates had spent five years looking for work . 
If a foreign company could not recruit a [MISC Libyan  ] for a given position , then it could bring in an expatriate to perform the job . 
As for [ORG Verenex  ] ( Ref D ) , he said the [ORG NOC  ] had simply had a disagreement over the sales price that [ORG Verenex  ] had proposed. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Comment: As in his previous meeting with emboffs , [PER Sugheir  ] stressed to the Ambassador that this recent change in leadership would not affect [ORG NOC  ] operations . 
Such assurances may be necessary to calm the nerves of skittish foreign investors , who believe [PER Ghanem  ] 's departure was due to political infighting that has yet to be resolved . 
Many of the energy insiders believe [PER Sugheir  ] is only a placeholder appointment , and that a permanent replacement for [PER Ghanem  ] will be named only when the the political dust has settled . 
Recent news regarding [ORG Saif  ] al-Islam [PER Qadhafi  ] 's new position as " General Coordinator " likely will add more grist to the rumor mill regarding the [ORG NOC  ] 's future leadership and direction . 
As expected , [PER Sugheir  ] refused to acknowledge in any way the " political " dimensions " of the [ORG Verenx  ] and [ORG Petrocanada  ] situations which has led to general investor discomfort . 
End comment .
