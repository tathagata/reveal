( C ) Second Vice President and Finance Minister [PER Pedro Solbes  ] said that [LOC Spain  ] was facing a " perfect storm " of adverse economic circumstances . 
He said that in the medium- to long term it was " easy " to do what [LOC Spain  ] needs to do ( he did not specify what ) , but that in the short-term , things were difficult . 
He said that he expected the next couple of quarters to be tough . 
The Ambassador noted that with unemployment rising , [LOC Spain  ] may have greater difficulty in integrating immigrants . 
[PER Solbes  ] responded that it depended on where the immigrants were from . 
[MISC Latin Americans  ] had no cultural problems . 
[MISC Romanians  ] ( the second largest immigrant group in [LOC Spain  ] ) might return to [LOC Romania  ] where the economy is growing quickly or go to other [ORG EU  ] countries . 
[PER Solbes  ] acknowledged , however , that [ORG North Africans  ] would likely stay , and should there be large numbers of unemployed youths in urban areas , that could pose a problem . 
[PER Solbes  ] emphasized that high oil prices were a particular burden on [LOC Spain  ] because it was so dependent on imported petroleum products ( more so than most other [ORG EU  ] countries ) . 
In the long-term , that had to change . 
He said his immediate problems would be much easier were oil prices to drop to [ORG USD  ] 100 a barrel ! ----------------------------------- TAXATION OF RELIGIOUS DENOMINATIONS ----------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In [LOC Spain  ] , religious groups such as the [MISC Mormons  ] , [PER Jehovah  ] 's Witnesses , and [MISC Buddhists  ] are recognized as religions with " well-known deeply-rooted " beliefs . 
However , they do not receive the same benefits and privileges as other religions that are also recognized as such . 
The Ambassador asked whether it would be possible to provide the same status . 
[PER Solbes  ] said that he was open to reviewing the issue , although he said that this year was not the best year to change something that might have negative revenue implications , marginal as he acknowledged they would probably be . 
The Finance Minister added that [LOC Spain  ] was changing rapidly with respect to religious matters .

In order for diplomacy to succeed , however , [LOC Iran  ] needed to be presented with a stark choice with respect to its economic future .

" Embassy will be following up with [PER Valero  ] with respect to the religous taxation and double taxation matters .
