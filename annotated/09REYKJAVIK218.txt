( C ) Summary . 
[PER Mark Flanagan  ] , leader of the [ORG IMF  ] review team here in [LOC Reykjavik  ] , believes [LOC Iceland  ] 's recovery could start in mid-2010 , but he cautioned that that the government must take several critical steps to lay the necessary groundwork , including significant fiscal austerity . 
Prior to the next [ORG IMF  ] review , said [PER Flanagan  ] , [LOC Iceland  ] must: 1 ) complete the 2010 budget and medium-term fiscal strategy ; 2 ) develop a public debt management strategy ; 3 ) recapitalize the banks ; and , 4 ) reform/ strengthen supervisory authority . 
Despite the popular attention focused on [ORG Icesave  ] , the budget deficit and recapitalizing the [ORG Central Bank  ] and the private sector banks are the most important factors in [LOC Iceland  ] 's growing debt burden . 
[PER Flanagan  ] appeared confident that [MISC Icelandic  ] authorities understand what they need to do . 
Whether they and the coalition in parliament can muster the political will to do so remains an open question . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On December 7 , Charge and Econoff discussed [LOC Iceland  ] 's progress on its [ORG IMF  ] program with [PER Mark Flanagan  ] , leader of the [ORG IMF  ] team here on a two week visit to [LOC Reykjavik  ] . 
Although [PER Flanagan  ] believes [LOC Iceland  ] 's recovery could start in mid-2010 , he cautioned that that the government must take several critical steps to lay the necessary groundwork as well as undertake significant fiscal austerity measures . 
Prior to the next [ORG IMF  ] review , said [PER Flanagan  ] , [LOC Iceland  ] must: 1 ) complete the 2010 budget and medium-term fiscal strategy ; 2 ) develop a public debt management strategy ; 3 ) recapitalize the banks ; and , 4 ) reform/ strengthen supervisory authority . 
These steps are the keys to a successful recovery . 
As for the current economic situation , [PER Flanagan  ] said that there had been limited decline in output as a result of fiscal stimulus and that recovery to positive economic growth could come by the third quarter . 
By the end of 2010 , he forecast that inflation would be about four percent . 
For interest rate policy to be effective , [LOC Iceland  ] should enforce capital controls more strictly. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Managing public and private sector debt would be a key challenge for [LOC Iceland  ] , [PER Flanagan  ] noted . 
A significant portion of [LOC Iceland  ] 's public sector debt will roll over in the next three years , he said , causing the country 's net debt to rise by 14 percent of GDP . 
Consequently , fiscal consolidation is critical . 
The [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] should have responsibility for debt management , but the [ORG Ministry  ] eliminated its debt management office several years ago when [LOC Iceland  ] ran a surplus and has no official dedicated to work on the issue at present . 
The [ORG IMF  ] is already providing technical assistance in this area. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Flanagan  ] stressed the need to address insolvency in the private sector lest the private sector stand in the way of public sector fiscal consolidation . 
He estimated that half of all corporations need restructuring and a quarter of all corporations are or will be insolvent . 
Corporate restructuring is difficult and will take time . 
A key constraint in [LOC Iceland  ] is the small size of the court system , where 48 judges to handle all cases , criminal and civil . 
[PER Flanagan  ] called for [LOC Iceland  ] to look at ways to facilitate debt restructuring outside of the courts to avoid overburdening the judicial system. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Flanagan  ] remarked several times that the country 's overall debt level , not the [ORG Icesave  ] debt , is the largest problem that [LOC Iceland  ] faces . 
Three larger contributors than [ORG Icesave  ] to the overall debt , he said , are the deficit ( projected to be 14 percent in 2009 ) , the [ORG Central Bank  ] 's huge liquidity losses suffered immediately after the collapse , and recapitalizing the banks . 
To illustrate this point , [PER Flanagan  ] noted that about 20 percent of GDP would be needed to recapitalize the [ORG Central Bank  ] 's liquidity losses , while the [ORG Icesave  ] debt is expected to add 10 to 15 percent of GDP to the debt load in 2016 . 
He also stated that [LOC Iceland  ] 's problems stem , in part , from the fact the country has a tax-rich structure that is suffering from a sharp decline in tax revenue , for which a structural adjustment of 10 percent of GDP is necessary . 
Despite these larger issues , [ORG Icesave  ] has played a significant role in the delay of [LOC Iceland  ] 's economic recovery , and people have been easily distracted by " silver bullet " ideas such as adopting the [MISC Euro  ] . 
[ORG Icesave  ] did not , however , delay the [ORG IMF  ] 's last review of the program , [PER Flanagan  ] noted , because the policy content for the review was not ready until early August . 
[ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000218 002 OF 002 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [ORG IMF  ] believes that [LOC Iceland  ] 's political leadership understands both the gravity of the situation and the requisite steps to put the economy back on track . 
[PER Flanagan  ] said that a deal to recapitalize [ORG Landsbanki  ] bank , an [ORG IMF  ] requirement , should be reached soon . 
The political bottlenecks due to [LOC Iceland  ] 's small size , however , mean progress will occur at a slower pace . 
( [ORG Note:  ] the [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] , for example , only has 75 employees . 
End note . 
) When asked about the future of the [ORG IMF  ] program if parliament were to reject the [ORG Icesave  ] bill , [PER Flanagan  ] stated that , in theory , the [ORG IMF  ] could adjust the program , but that it would require significant reworking . 
The [ORG IMF  ] would like to continue with the current program and , as the financing from the [MISC Nordics  ] is essential to the current program , he is hopeful that parliament will pass the [ORG Icesave  ] bill and receive access to the [MISC Nordic  ] loan. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [ORG IMF  ] expects to reach agreement with the Government of [LOC Iceland  ] on the policy content for the next review by the time [PER Flanagan  ] departs next week . 
The next review could take place as early as late December or early to mid January. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Flanagan  ] seemed confident that [MISC Icelandic  ] authorities understand what they need to do . 
Whether they and the coalition in parliament can muster the political will to do so remains an open question . 
End Comment .
