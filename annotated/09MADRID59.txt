( C ) [PER A/S Shannon  ] told [PER Leon  ] that during the Secretary 's December 2008 trip to [LOC Panama  ] for the first Pathways to Prosperity plenary , the [LOC U.S.  ] had made efforts to engage with all countries in the region that had expressed interest in free trade . 
[PER Leon  ] raised the [ORG EU  ] accords with [LOC Central America  ] and [LOC Colombia  ] . 
He lamented that [LOC Bolivia  ] would likely be excluded due to the negative influence of [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
[LOC Ecuador  ] , he surmised , would want in on any trade agreement in order to protect banana exports . 
[LOC MEXICO  ] AND [LOC BRAZIL  ] ----------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Jimenez  ] praised the [LOC U.S.  ] for focusing attention on [LOC Mexico  ] 's border with [LOC Guatemala  ] . 
Hearing that President-elect [PER Obama  ] would meet with [MISC Mexican  ] President [PER Calderon  ] January 12 , she called it a good initiative to form new institutional relationships . 
She expressed concern about [PER Calderon  ] 's capacity to fight corruption within his government but noted the widespread respect he commanded in the region. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Leon  ] and [PER Jimenez  ] were very upbeat about [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Regarding [PER Lula  ] 's efforts on behalf of regional integration , [PER Jimenez  ] assured [PER Shannon  ] , " if it is good for [LOC Latin America  ] , it is good for [LOC Spain  ] . 
" She suggested [LOC Spain  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] should see each other and also [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Mexico  ] as partners rather than rivals . 
Discarding the idea that the [LOC U.S.  ] had been excluded from December meetings in [LOC Sauipe  ] , [PER Shannon  ] praised [PER Lula  ] 's leadership and quoted the Secretary as calling [LOC Brazil  ] " a regional power and a global partner . 
" [PER Jimenez  ] was also supportive of " a strong [LOC Brazil  ] and an involved [LOC Mexico  ] . 
" CENTRAL AMERCIA --------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) On [LOC Guatemala  ] , both [PER Jimenez  ] and [PER Leon  ] expressed disappointment with [PER Colom  ] 's slowness in recognizing and confronting the problems of corruption and organized crime . 
[PER Jimenez  ] told [PER A/S Shannon  ] she would travel to [LOC Guatemala  ] soon to address concerns over insecurity and drug violence . 
She said [LOC Spain  ] would also add an [ORG Interior Ministry  ] representative to its embassy in [LOC Guatemala  ] to support the [MISC Spanish Civil Guard  ] 's work in training [MISC Guatemalan  ] national police . 
[PER Leon  ] noted the [MISC Guatemalan  ] President had invited two [MISC Spanish  ] advisors from the Office of the [ORG Presidency  ] and suggested they should make contact with the [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy there to exchange views . 
[PER Leon  ] was generally optimistic about [LOC Costa Rica  ] , and opined that [LOC El Salvador  ] would be okay following March 15 presidential elections , but noted it would be better if ARENA won . 
[PER Leon  ] described [MISC Nicaraguan  ] President [PER Ortega  ] as a " lost cause . 
" He said [PER Zapatero  ] had refused to meet with [PER Ortega  ] during the October 2008 [MISC Latin American  ] Summit in [LOC El Salvador  ] . 
[PER Jimenez  ] called [PER Ortega  ] the worst of all the leaders with whom she works . 
SOUTHERN CONE ------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Leon  ] told [PER Shannon  ] the [ORG GOS  ] supports the [ORG Marsans Group  ] in its dispute with Aerolineas Argentinas but said [LOC Spain  ] would take measures to improve the climate before the February 8 visit to [LOC Madrid  ] of [MISC Argentine  ] President [PER Fernandez de Kirchner  ] . 
[PER Shannon  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] had made enormous efforts to maintain a good relationship with [LOC Argentina  ] , with mixed results . 
[PER Leon  ] agreed the [PER Kirchner  ] team was " lamentable , " and doubted [LOC Argentina  ] 's " perverse system " could be fixed , yet he expressed hope that [MISC Argentines  ] would one day reclaim their political space . 
He offered to deliver any messages the [LOC U.S.  ] might wish during [PER Fernandez Kirchner  ] 's February visit . 
[PER Leon  ] said [LOC Spain  ] was not worried about the outcome of [MISC Chilean  ] elections , but expressed disappointment in [MISC Paraguayan  ] President [PER Lugo  ] . 
[LOC ANDES  ] ----- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Leon  ] noted [LOC Ecuador  ] 's need to be more competitive to make up for the loss of its oil income . 
Saying he was hopeful about [MISC Ecuadorian  ] President [PER Correa  ] , he conceded his first impression , at the time of [LOC Ecuador  ] 's expropriation of foreign oil companies , had been decidedly negative . 
He observed [PER Correa  ] continued to manipulate debt and market access issues for his own political gain , and he opined the [MISC Ecuadorian  ] President needed a positive " mentor " in the region. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Referring to [LOC Ecuador  ] 's March 2008 border conflict with [LOC Colombia  ] and [PER Correa  ] 's subsequent [MISC European  ] tour , [PER Leon  ] expressed lingering frustration with [PER Correa  ] 's propensity to express " barbarities " after a carefully managed and very moderate joint statement with President [PER Zapatero  ] .

[LOC CUBA  ] ---- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) In his conversations with both [PER Jimenez  ] and [PER Leon  ] , [ORG A/S Shannon  ] noted [LOC Cuba  ] 's long resistance to democratic change , and said the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC Spain  ] , and other countries must continue to promote such change , pressing consistently for freedom for political prisoners and political space for a democratic opposition . 
[PER Jimenez  ] mentioned the difficulties of negotiating with the [ORG GOC  ] , as in the case of humanitarian aid offers in the wake of hurricanes [ORG Ike  ] and [PER Gustav  ] , but insisted it was important to make such gestures even if [LOC Cuba  ] ultimately refused them . 
Anticipating the third round of [LOC EU-Cuba  ] human rights talks January 15-16 , [PER Jimenez  ] said the [MISC Czechs  ] ( holding the [ORG EU  ] Presidency ) did not appear interested in sending messages . 
[LOC Spain  ] , on the other hand , wanted to find the " right formula , " presumably not a public one , to speak of pluralism and to visit dissidents . 
[PER Jimenez  ] said she might travel to [LOC Cuba  ] in May 2009 and joked that , looking to the June review of the [ORG EU  ] 's common position on [LOC Cuba  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] ought to give the [MISC Czechs  ] instructions that would be helpful to [LOC Spain  ] 's efforts . 
[PER Jimenez  ] expounded on what she called the discrepancies between [LOC Miami  ] and [LOC Washington  ] approaches to [LOC Cuba  ] and argued that the [LOC U.S.  ] transition was " the best excuse " for a change in [LOC U.S.  ] policy. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Leon  ] asked [ORG A/S Shannon  ] to convey [LOC Spain  ] 's intention to work closely with the [LOC U.S.  ] on any possible [MISC Spanish  ] presidential visit to [LOC Cuba  ] . 
He did not discard the possibility [PER Zapatero  ] could travel to [LOC Cuba  ] in 2009 , but he noted [PER Zapatero  ] had backtracked following conflicting public statements by [ORG GOS  ] officials . 
[PER Jimenez  ] retreated further , saying perhaps [PER Zapatero  ] would not visit in 2009 but that a visit would be reasonable during this legislature ( which ends in 2012 ) if it could help promote change in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
AREAS FOR COOPERATION -------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( SBU ) [PER Leon  ] asked about the prospects for extending the [ORG Merida Initiative  ] to [ORG Central America  ] . 
[ORG A/S Shannon  ] said that $60 million in funding from the first tranche of $465 million was slated for [ORG Central America  ] . 
An additional $150 million was requested for [ORG Central America  ] in the [MISC FY-2009  ] budget request . 
Director General of Cooperation with Iberoamerica [PER Consuelo Femenia  ] joined [ORG Jimenez'  ] lunch for [ORG A/S Shannon  ] and briefed on [LOC Spain  ] 's assistance programs in the hemisphere . 
[PER Femenia  ] spoke of [MISC Spanish  ] emphasis on governability , gender issues , and the health sector and noted the importance of continuity of development aid in countries like [LOC Bolivia  ] , where [LOC Spain  ] 's bilateral plans are in limbo . 
While [PER Jimenez  ] said [LOC Spain  ] had not restricted cooperation to [LOC Bolivia  ] , the [ORG GOS  ] was conscious of the need to make assistance more " efficient . 
" To that end , lunch attendees espoused the benefits of triangular cooperation . 
[ORG A/S Shannon  ] called for increased coherence among assistance programs . 
He suggested the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Spain  ] review opportunities for triangular cooperation . 
[ORG GAZA AND FOOD SECURITY  ] ---------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [ORG Gaza  ] crept into discussions of [LOC Latin America  ] . 
[PER Leon  ] described FM [PER Moratinos  ] 's planned trip the week of January 12 to [LOC Egypt  ] , [LOC Israel  ] , [LOC Syria  ] , and the [LOC West Bank  ] . 
[ORG A/S Shannon  ] encouraged [PER Leon  ] to stay in touch with [LOC U.S.  ] officials on the [LOC Middle East  ] to maintain an exchange of views ( Note: [PER Moratinos  ] reached out the Secretary by telephone January 15 to describe his trip . 
End note ) . 
[PER Leon  ] also pulled [ORG A/S Shannon  ] aside to stress the importance to the [ORG GOS  ] attaches to the [MISC UN High-Level Meeting  ] on Food Security in [LOC Madrid  ] January 26-27 . 
[ORG CASA DE AMERICA  ] --------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( U ) [ORG A/S Shannon  ] and [PER Jimenez  ] drew a standing-room only crowd for an on the record breakfast colloquium January 9 at [LOC Casa  ] de [LOC America  ] ( the [MISC Spanish  ] Government 's influential cultural institute for [LOC Latin America  ] ) . 
[ORG A/S Shannon  ] spoke of seeking new partners and opening new space for democracy and economic opportunity in [LOC Latin America  ] . 
He noted the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Spain  ] shared a strategic vision in the region . 
He acknowledged that [LOC Spain  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] might differ on tactics in some cases but emphasized shared goals . 
He stressed the need to work not just with [MISC Latin American  ] countries but with all countries who have strategic interests in the region . 
Asked whether 2009 would be the year of [LOC Cuba  ] , [PER Jimenez  ] expressed hope for a change of [LOC U.S.  ] attitude but commented the future of the embargo depended on gestures from both sides . 
[ORG A/S Shannon  ] in turn insisted on the importance of the international community actively promoting democratic change . 
He emphasized it was more than just meeting dissidents during visits to the island , important though that was . 
Countries needed to work collaboratively and consistently with the dissidents to help them create space for a democratic opposition . 
MEDIA HOMERUNS -------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( U ) [ORG A/S Shannon  ] granted interviews to the three leading media outlets . 
Left-of-center daily [ORG El Pais  ] ( circulation 2.2 million ) , published a full page interview January 11 . 
[ORG A/S Shannon  ] participated in the live broadcast [LOC Cadena Ser Radio  ] program " [LOC La Ventana  ] " ( average listenership 750,000 ) . 
Number-one ranked [ORG Television Espanola  ] ( [ORG TVE  ] ) recorded an interview with [ORG A/S Shannon  ] for its regular program " [MISC Barrio Latino  ] . 
" The show will air January 20 and will reach audiences throughout [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC Latin America  ] on January 20 . 
In each interview , [ORG A/S Shannon  ] laid out [LOC U.S.  ] policy in [LOC Latin America  ] and strongly defended the [ORG USG  ] 's engagement with the region in recent years . 
Topics of particular interest to the media included [LOC U.S.  ] policy towards [LOC Cuba  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] , prospects for trade and investment in the region given the economic crisis , drug trafficking and the [ORG Merida Initiative  ] , and the perceived rise of leftist/populist leaders in several [MISC Latin American  ] countries . 
Leading journalists and directors of [MISC Spanish  ] news wire service EFE also participated in the colloquium January 9 . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [MISC Spanish  ] views continue to resonate with our own on most things [MISC Latin American  ] . 
The [ORG GOS  ] expresses frustration with the same leaders and situations that are of greatest concern to us . 
On [LOC Cuba  ] , where we have our greatest tactical differences , [LOC Spain  ] is watching closely for signals from the new [ORG U.S. Administration  ] and hopes to consult closely on the issue . 
Throughout the [LOC Western Hemisphere  ] , [LOC Spain  ] seems genuinely interested in working with the [LOC U.S.  ] , and the [ORG Merida Initiative  ] may present a unique opportunity to do so if we can move beyond [MISC Spanish  ] good intentions to concrete actions . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] are increasingly aware that many of [LOC Latin America  ] 's ills , such as narcotics trafficking , impact them as much or more than the [ORG U.S. A/S Shannon  ] 's visit was an extremely well-timed and typically effective push in the right direction . 
For historical and cultural reasons , [LOC Spain  ] likes to regard [LOC Latin America  ] as something of a special preserve and itself as the opinion leader within [LOC Europe  ] . 
Nevertheless , [MISC Spanish  ] officials such as [PER Leon  ] and [PER Jimenez  ] are keenly aware of the preponderant [LOC U.S.  ] influence in the region and are anxious to maintain the fluid dialogue that has been established in recent years . 
The [ORG Zapatero Administration  ] is likely to maintain its preference for low key diplomacy in dealing with problem countries in [LOC Latin America  ] , but that is not say we cannot have a mutually-beneficial partnership in the region. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 .
