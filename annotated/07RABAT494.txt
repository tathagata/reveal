( [LOC C  ] ) [LOC Spain  ] hosted Polcounselors from [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC U.K.  ] , [LOC France  ] and [LOC EU-President Germany  ] for an informal discussion of [LOC Western Sahara  ] developments March 14 . 
In general , participants noted the intensity of [MISC Moroccan  ] diplomatic efforts , including multiple consultations with [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC France  ] , and [LOC Spain  ] . 
The energy of the initiative , however , did not appear to be matched by any apparent breakthrough on the substance of autonomy that could convince the other side . 
The broad outlines of the autonomy plan , which have been universally briefed , suggested [LOC Rabat  ] would retain full control , and did not go far beyond what was in the 2003 plan . 
That had been rejected out of hand by Baker and governments. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The [MISC French  ] continue to broadly support the [MISC Moroccan  ] position . 
They believe that the [ORG GOM  ] effort should be encouraged by the [ORG UNSC  ] by some explicit mention and also support encouraging the parties to negotiate . 
After some informal discussions with [PER Van Walsum  ] , the [MISC French  ] were concerned that [ORG SYG Ban Ki Moon  ] will be very conservative on his report to the Council . 
It will be his first and he will likely want to keep the text of the last report . 
The [MISC French  ] continue to insist on self-determination , but the act of self-determination can be an institutional arrangement that is endorsed by a vote that comes way down the line . 
They were to have formal discussions with [PER Van Walsum  ] in [LOC Paris  ] this week <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The [MISC Germans  ] will try to forge a common [MISC European  ] position but are not confident of doing so . 
For [LOC Europe  ] as a whole , the principal interest is that [LOC Morocco  ] has been an island of stability in a crucial but shaky near neighborhood . 
This stability must be preserved , so a solution to the [LOC Sahara  ] problem that destabilizes [LOC Morocco  ] proper is undesirable. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The [MISC Spanish  ] host was not happy . 
For [LOC Spain  ] , the [LOC Sahara  ] is now a hot domestic political issue . 
Last week , in the joint declaration of the [ORG Zapatero  ] visit , they had agreed to a statement cautiously praising the [MISC Moroccan  ] proposals as a basis for progress . 
The [MISC Algerians  ] then raised the price of gas exports to [LOC Spain  ] by a hefty amount described in the press as 20 percent . 
( Comment: This move , possibly worth hundreds of millions of dollars , may have been in the cards anyway . 
End comment . 
) The [MISC Spanish  ] Parliament unanimously ( including [ORG Zapatero  ] 's own Socialist party ) appeared to repudiate this endorsement by voting for a bill proposed by leftist splinter parties to return to the historical [MISC Spanish  ] approach focusing on self-determination . 
King [PER Juan Carlos  ] , in [LOC Algiers  ] this week , tried to dodge the issue and was accommodated by [PER Bouteflika  ] . 
FM Moratinos , with the King in [LOC Algiers  ] , published an op-ed walking the cat back on the [MISC Moroccan  ] proposals , stressing [MISC Spanish  ] rejection of unilateral solutions , and support for negotiations without preconditions. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) [ORG Polcouns  ] briefed on his recently completed trip to [LOC Sahara  ] . 
[ORG GOM  ] consultation with the [MISC Sahrawi  ] has been minimal , but there appeared to be interest in the prospect of a plan . 
Local observers believe that most of the original [MISC Sahrawis  ] were still opposed to [MISC Moroccan  ] overlordship , but they now admitted to being a minority of current population in the territory . 
Both pro and anti-government [MISC Sahrawis  ] mostly want to manage own affairs , the difference is trust , which is eroded by continuing , if modestly abating , human rights violations . 
It appeared that the [MISC Moroccans  ] have put in a lot of work on their proposals , and it now looked like they will at least have a plan to put on the table in April , but no one has yet seen anything that will win many additional [MISC Sahrawi  ] hearts and minds. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) [LOC Algeria  ] remained a thorny question for all . 
[LOC Algiers  ] is beginning to react to the [ORG GOM  ] diplomatic offensive , but has stuck tightly to its insistence on the Baker formula . 
[LOC France  ] said [LOC Algiers  ] is like a boxer in a corner , and could lash out . 
Levers to persuade them are few , as the [MISC Spanish  ] have discovered . 
Opening the border with [LOC Morocco  ] will benefit the [LOC Kingdom  ] and [LOC Algeria  ] both , but the latter doesn't need it . 
The only fruitful area of collaboration , as noted by the [MISC German  ] , was counterterrorism , but this may not be enough to foster a rapprochement . 
[LOC Russia  ] may have some influence with the [MISC Algerians  ] , but the [MISC French  ] said their Embassy in [LOC Moscow  ] commented that the [MISC Russian  ] were unlikely to play a constructive role ( apparently without haing directly posed the question to the [ORG GOR  ] ) . 
They unhappily recalled [MISC GAZPROM-SONATRACH  ] discussions on forming a cartel . 
The [MISC French  ] believed that giving the [MISC Algerians  ] some formal status in the negotiations , not as a party , which they refuse , but as a [PER Godfather  ] ( parrain ) could provide some incentive. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) On next steps , the [MISC French  ] have advised the [ORG GOM  ] to present their plan first to the UNSYG to include in his report , and to the April [ORG UNSC  ] president , the [LOC UK  ] . 
The [LOC U.K.  ] said they expected to see a [MISC Moroccan  ] draft during their [ORG UNSC  ] presidency. ****************************************** Visit Embassy [LOC Rabat  ] 's Classified Website ; http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/rabat ****************************************** Riley</pre></code>
