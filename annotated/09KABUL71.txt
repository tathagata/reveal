Fowler  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) Summary -------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG UK PRT/Task Force Helmand  ] ( [ORG TFH  ] ) transported Helmand Governor [PER Mangal  ] , several of his staff and members of the local media to the [LOC Sangin District  ] for an extensive outreach program . 
January 5 , 2009 . 
The visit lasted six hours and included visits to the [ORG District Center  ] , [ORG Sangin School  ] , [ORG Sangin Bazaar  ] and the under-construction industrial park . 
It was the Governor , s second trip to the city in three months . 
In practical terms the visit was a serious setback for the [MISC British  ] PRT , s relationship with Governor [PER Mangal  ] as the lack of visible progress in [LOC Sangin  ] is clearly frustrating [PER Mangal  ] . 
Governor [PER Mangal’s Frustrations  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) The Governor has been pushing the [MISC PRT/TFH  ] to expand the secure areas in and around the city but during the visit to [LOC Sangin  ] he was only allowed about 200 meters beyond the [ORG FOB  ] perimeter and was unable to walk through the bazaar . 
He had sent his security staff forward to work with the [ORG UK Stabilization  ] officer in anticipation of having 500 people attend the event . 
However , a [ORG Taliban  ] threat the previous night affected coordination for the event and only 100 local residents attended the [ORG Shura.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Prior to departing [LOC Sangin  ] , the Governor called a meeting with the [LOC UK  ] leadership and [ORG US PRTOFF  ] and expressed his displeasure with the situation and [MISC PRT/TFH  ] efforts in [LOC Sangin  ] . 
He said , “Stop calling it the [LOC Sangin District  ] and start calling it the [LOC Sangin  ] Base , all you have done here is built a military camp next to the city . 
I asked you people to do reconstruction and yet the District Governor remains in the [ORG FOB  ] and how can you expect a city to recover if the Bazaar is not in the security zone.” [PER Mangal  ] said he would direct the District Governor to establish a compound in the city and he wanted the PRT to deliver reconstruction , schools , clinics , and roads , with the bazaar being the heart of an economic zone , as it is in [LOC Garmsir.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Also present during the day were the [ORG ANA  ] commander and District Governor who leveled several charges that [LOC UK  ] troops were searching compounds , walking on the roofs of homes and treating the local population badly -- including pointing weapons at people and going into areas where women were working . 
These comments were raised during the [ORG Shura  ] and in early meetings the Governor had with the elders . 
In the public forum of the [ORG Shura  ] , [PER Mangal  ] strongly defended the [ORG ISAF  ] forces , work and called upon the local community to work with [ORG ISAF  ] to defeat the [ORG Taliban  ] . 
In the private meeting these comments from the local leadership inflamed an already tense situation , and caused [PER Mangal  ] to say that PRT coordination must be improved as well as the attitude toward the local population . 
[MISC PRT/TFH  ] noted that there has been progress in many other areas of [LOC Helmand  ] , and reminded the Governor that [LOC Musa Qala  ] , [LOC Garmsir  ] and [LOC Nad Ali  ] operations all occurred since the [LOC UK  ] had liberated [LOC Sangin  ] and there have never been sufficient , [ORG ISAF  ] or [MISC Afghan  ] forces , to control the whole district . 
[MISC PRT/TFH  ] Frustrations -------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Following the visit , the PRT and [ORG Task Force  ] leadership convened to review the day’s events . 
It was clear from the discussion the [LOC UK  ] is also frustrated with the situation in [LOC Sangin  ] and all had hoped for greater progress by this point . 
[LOC UK  ] leadership seems to be divided into two camps . 
The first wants to do no more in [LOC Sangin  ] and move resources from the area into [LOC Gereshk  ] and [LOC Garmsir  ] where progress is possible and the population is more supportive ; the military seems to favor this route . 
The second camp ( the civilian approach ) wants to simply hold what they have and wait for the [LOC U.S.  ] to interject troops and funds they think will allow them to re-allocate forces and perhaps expand the [LOC Sangin  ] Zone . 
Comment ------- [LOC KABUL  ] 00000071 002 OF 002 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Enemy forces are still within 500-600 meters of the [ORG District Center  ] and [LOC UK  ] soldiers told [ORG DOS PRTOFF  ] that at the edge of the city , “Cowboy Country begins.” Any sizeable reduction in [LOC UK  ] forces would almost certainly bring the [ORG District Center  ] under regular indirect fire and further destabilize an already tenuous situation . 
The [LOC UK  ] effort in [LOC Helmand  ] is already in a “wait and see” mode , wildly speculating when and where [LOC U.S.  ] troops will go , obsessed about CERP amounts , and doing nothing to correct the difficult situation already in [LOC Sangin.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) During the visit , [PER Mangal  ] made a strong reconciliation push to the assembled body , saying he was willing to meet with anyone and guarantee their safety if they wanted to discuss reconciliation . 
The message was clearly directed to the absent [LOC Alizai  ] leadership , leaving the next move up to them . 
The offer was well received by the group and [ORG DOS PRTOFF  ] believes that if [PER Mangal  ] can sustain his outreach efforts to [LOC Sangin  ] , and deliver more reconstruction and development programs , he has a chance to bring in the fence sitters and undermine some of the [LOC Alizai  ] support still reserved for [MISC Sher Mohammid Akunzda  ] .
