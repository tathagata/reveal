( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary . 
[ORG DNI  ] Dennis [PER Blair  ] met with [ORG Defense Secretary General  ] [PER Guillermo Galvan Galvan  ] on October 19 on the heels of meetings with President [PER Calderon  ] and members of his national security team ( ref a and b ) . 
The discussion focused largely on the military 's role in the counternarcotics fight , with [PER Galvan  ] lamenting a likely lengthy domestic mandate , the need for improved translation of intelligence into operations , and his mistrust of other [ORG GOM  ] security elements . 
[PER Galvan  ] is clearly seeking cooperation from the [ORG USG  ] to strengthen his institution 's capacity to fight drug trafficking organizations , but will try to keep military actions in its own channels rather than working more broadly with [LOC Mexico  ] 's law enforcement community . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) To open the discussion with General [PER Galvan  ] [PER Galvan  ] and high-ranking members of his intel team , [PER DNI Blair  ] recognized the challenges a military confronts when it has to fight a war -- in this case against drug trafficking organizations -- within its own country . 
In response to the [ORG DNI  ] 's question on how the [ORG GOM  ] can make the transition away from the armed forces to a strictly civilian counternarcotics domestic fight , [PER Galvan  ] said that he does not currently see a quick end to their internal deployment . 
He indicated that the effort is difficult for the military , in part due to the perception that they lack the legal framework to back their deployment . 
He noted that [ORG SEDENA  ] is working with [ORG Congress  ] to pass legislation that would address this matter . 
( Note: [PER Calderon  ] submitted to [ORG Congress  ] last session a [ORG National Security Law  ] that looks to codify the military 's role in the domestic [ORG CN  ] fight . 
End note . 
) He also mentioned that [ORG Article  ] 29 of the constitution calling for a state of exception " in certain areas of the country might provide them with such legal authority ( see septel for discussion on [ORG Article  ] 29 ) . 
[ORG SEDENA  ] runs the risk of losing public prestige and being criticized on human rights issues as its mandate is extended , but he nevertheless expects the military to maintain its current role for the next 7 to 10 years . 
[PER Galvan  ] did suggest that increased [LOC U.S.  ] intelligence assistance could shorten that time frame , and also applauded [ORG USG  ] efforts to prevent arms trafficking across the border into [LOC Mexico.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Galvan  ] indicated that he is interested in establishing the highest levels of cooperation with the [ORG USG  ] , particularly in light of its " new authorities " as the institution responsible for capturing high-value targets , including two members of the [ORG Zetas  ] and [ORG Sinaloa  ] cartel head [LOC Joaquin  ] " [LOC El Chapo  ] " [PER Guzman Loera  ] . 
He further said that [ORG SEDENA  ] was implementing a three stage operation to specifically target [PER Chapo  ] . 
The first stage , which they have largely accomplished , is to establish a physical force in the area of his operation primarily intended to collect intelligence . 
He noted that they have found 10 to 15 locations where he moves , but that [PER Chapo  ] commands the support of a large network of informers and has security circles of up to 300 men that make launching capture operations difficult . 
The second stage is to deploy a circle of troops into the area of his movements , which [PER Galvan  ] hopes to do shortly . 
The third stage is his capture. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [ORG DNI  ] suggested that improving the intelligence capabilities of deployed units would improve the troops' ability to launch more rapid operations , as the [ORG USG  ] learned in its experience in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[PER Galvan  ] said the concept is clear -- he understands that good intelligence is worthless without a capable reaction force . 
He noted [ORG SEDENA  ] should improve vertical communication on intelligence matters , and said they would be willing to accept any training the [ORG USG  ] can offer . 
[PER Galvan  ] complained that joint operations with law enforcement entities are challenging because leaks of planning and information by corrupted officials have compromised past efforts . 
Bringing police , particularly at the state and local level , up to standard will be challenging and a prolonged process . 
[PER Galvan  ] said that [ORG SEDENA  ] 's permanent deployment of two officers to the [LOC El Paso Intelligence Center  ] will help to disseminate rapidly information to the [MISC Ciudad Juarez  ] commander .
