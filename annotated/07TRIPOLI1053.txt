REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: [LOC U.S.  ] companies [ORG AECOM  ] and the [ORG Tennessee Overseas Construction Company  ] ( [ORG TOCC  ] ) inked separate deals worth a total of $2.0 to $3.0 billion with [LOC Libya  ] 's Housing and [ORG Infrastructure Board  ] . 
[ORG AECOM  ] is to provide project management for all infrastructure development under the [ORG HIB  ] 's auspices , and has committed to an ambitious [MISC U.S.-based  ] training program for [ORG HIB  ] executives and engineers . 
[ORG TOCC  ] 's agreement obliges the company to undertake high-profile infrastructure construction and refurbishment projects in [LOC Tripoli  ] and [LOC Benghazi  ] ; the company envisages bringing up to 130 [MISC American  ] employees to [LOC Libya  ] in the coming year to help manage its projects . 
The [ORG GOL  ] apparently awarded the contracts to [LOC U.S.  ] firms for at least partly political purposes , telling company representatives that the deals symbolize the fact that [MISC U.S.-Libyan  ] ties have moved beyond strictly security ( i.e. , [ORG WMD  ] and counter-terrorism ) concerns . 
The agreements underscore that the [ORG GOL  ] continues to directly link commercial contracts to political relationships . 
The potential return to [LOC Libya  ] of large numbers of non-official [MISC Americans  ] has positive potential for people-to-people and cultural exchange , but could further anger [MISC Islamic  ] militants already troubled by [MISC U.S.-Libyan  ] reengagement . 
[ORG AECOM  ] TO MANAGE ALL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS 2 . 
( U ) After nearly two months of negotiations , [MISC Houston-based  ] company [ORG AECOM  ] signed a mega-contract December 13 with [LOC Libya  ] 's Housing and [ORG Infrastructure Board  ] ( [ORG HIB  ] ) to provide project management services . 
The contract guarantees two years of work for [ORG AECOM  ] for $201 million , and provides for three additional option years for a potential total contract value of $574 million . 
[ORG AECOM  ] is to lead the [ORG HIB  ] 's 250-member [ORG Program Management Department  ] in its administering of all projects that fall within the [ORG GOL  ] 's $50 billion comprehensive housing and infrastructure development program , to include contracts with any third-country companies . 
The scope of the development program includes urban design and development , housing unit construction , road construction and upgrades , and development of wastewater management systems . 
FOCUS ON TRAINING , HUMAN [ORG CAPACITY BUILDING  ] 3 . 
( C ) Reflecting the [ORG GOL  ] 's continuing focus on capacity-building , the contract obliges [ORG AECOM  ] to train over 100 [ORG HIB  ] executives , engineers and technical specialists in project management at [ORG AECOM  ] 's [LOC Houston  ] headquarters during the coming calendar year . 
Dr. [PER Ibrahim Shukhri  ] , head of [ORG HIB  ] 's [ORG Program Management Department  ] , told P/E Chief December 16 that three senior [ORG HIB  ] officials have already applied in [LOC Tunis  ] for J-1 visas to undertake a year-long program management course in [LOC Houston  ] . 
Additional tranches of [ORG HIB  ] engineers -- currently envisaged as cohorts of 50 , 25 and 25 -- are scheduled to undergo three month training courses in [LOC Houston  ] beginning in [LOC March/April  ] next year . 
[PER Jim Thompson  ] , President of [ORG AECOM  ] subsidiary [ORG Turner Collie & Braden  ] and [ORG AECOM  ] 's signatory on the contract , told P/E Chief December 13 that [ORG AECOM  ] plans to send up to 30 [MISC American  ] employees to [LOC Libya  ] in the first half of 2008 to help manage a bevy of recently concluded housing and infrastructure contracts ( reftel and previous ) . 
[ORG TOCC  ] WINS MEGA-CONTRACT FOR HOUSING , INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS 4 . 
( U ) Separately , the [ORG Tennessee Oveseas Construction Company  ] ( [ORG TOCC  ] ) , in partnership with [ORG Washington Group International  ] , signed a [MISC LD  ] 1.5 billion ( about $1.2 billion ) agreement with the [ORG HIB  ] December 16 . 
( Note: It is believed that the agreement represents the largest single non-oil and gas deal for a [LOC U.S.  ] company in [LOC Libya  ] to date . 
End note . 
) The deal was concluded in a televised meeting of the [ORG HIB  ] at which a total of over [MISC LD  ] 6.85 billion ( about $5.3 billion ) worth of infrastructure contracts with companies from [LOC India  ] , [LOC China  ] , [LOC Korea  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] , [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC Tunisia  ] were signed . 
[ORG TOCC  ] 's agreement obliges the company to undertake high-profile infrastructure construction and refurbishment projects in [LOC Tripoli  ] and [LOC Benghazi  ] , to include housing units , roads and wastewater management . 
The contract represents a framework agreement ; individual contracts for specific projects envisaged in the framework agreement are to be negotiated separately . 
The agreement guarantees $1.2 billion [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00001053 002.2 OF 003 worth of work , but [ORG TOCC  ] 's local office director , [PER Selim Edes  ] , told P/E Chief that it could be expanded to include a rainwater collection project in [LOC Benghazi  ] , which could bring the total contract value to between $2.5 and $3.0 billion . 
LARGE NUMBERS OF AMERICANS TO RETURN TO [LOC LIBYA  ] ? 5 . 
( C ) [ORG TOCC  ] Finance Director [PER Jennifer Windus  ] ( protect ) , who signed for the company , told the Charge that the company plans to send 50 [MISC American  ] employees , up to a third of whom may come with families ( about 15-20 children ) , to [LOC Libya  ] in the next five months . 
[ORG TOCC  ] envisages a total [MISC American  ] employee presence of 100 within the coming calendar year , with a possible 30 additional employees in [LOC Benghazi  ] if the rainwater collection project comes to fruition . 
She noted that obtaining [MISC Libyan  ] visas and securing appropriate housing could significantly slow the dispatch of those employees . 
[ORG TOCC  ] 's [LOC Tripoli  ] office currently comprises 15 locally-engaged staff . 
[ORG AECOM  ] , [ORG TOCC  ] BENEFIT FROM GOL'S DESIRE TO SEND POLITICAL SIGNAL 6 . 
( C ) [PER Windus  ] told the Charge that [PER Dorda  ] and other [ORG HIB  ] officials had stressed that they wanted to award the contract to a [LOC U.S.  ] company as " a symbol " of the fact that the bilateral relationship had moved beyond strictly security ( i.e. , [ORG WMD  ] and counter-terrorism ) concerns . 
The fact that [ORG TOCC  ] was a [LOC U.S.  ] company was " critical " from the [ORG HIB  ] 's perspective . 
[PER Windus  ] telephoned P/E Chief later in the day seeking an Embassy quote for the company 's press release ; she said [PER Dorda  ] had counseled her to solicit remarks emphasizing the political , vice commercial , significance of the contract . 
( Note: Post 's anodyne language welcomed news of the contract as a sign of the continuing development of [MISC U.S.-Libyan  ] ties . 
End note . 
) [PER Dorda  ] reportedly underscored that the Charge 's attendance at the contract signing was " an important symbol of the new relationship " . 
7 . 
( C ) Separately , [ORG AECOM  ] 's [PER Jim Thompson  ] ( protect ) shared with P/E Chief December 13 his impression that being an [MISC American  ] company had been " extremely important " to securing the contract . 
He conceded that unnamed [MISC European  ] firms had submitted bids that were in some respects more competitive , but the [ORG HIB  ] 's desire to " buy [MISC American  ] " -- in part for purposes of political symbolism -- carried the day for [ORG AECOM  ] . 
[ORG HIB  ] SEEKS GREATER [LOC U.S.  ] COMPANY PARTICIPATION IN LIBYA'S INFRASTRUCTURE RENAISSANCE 8 . 
( C ) In a meeting with the Charge before the signing ceremony , [ORG HIB  ] Chairman [PER Abuzaid Dorda  ] sounded a similar refrain , saying more [LOC U.S.  ] companies should " focus on the future " and bid for lucrative [ORG GOL  ] development contracts . 
Noting that some [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC European  ] companies remain " hesitant " about doing business in [LOC Libya  ] because of past contretemps , he reiterated the [ORG GOL  ] 's desire for greater participation by [LOC U.S.  ] companies in large-scale infrastructure and development projects . 
Stressing the [MISC American  ] angle , he noted that [ORG AECOM  ] enjoyed the [ORG HIB  ] 's " full confidence " and said the [ORG HIB  ] would sign a contract worth " hundreds of millions of dollars " ( [ORG NFI  ] ) with [LOC U.S.  ] company [ORG KBR  ] on December 30 for infrastructure projects in [LOC Benghazi  ] . 
PUBLIC COMMITMENT TO ANTI-CORRUPTION .. . 
9 . 
( U ) In a subsequent televised meeting of the [ORG HIB  ] that resembled nothing so much as a game show , [PER Dorda  ] continued sounding the [MISC American  ] theme . 
[ORG TOCC  ] 's was the first contract signed on-air ; Dr. [PER Shukhri  ] told P/E Chief that the decision had been deliberately designed to " emphasize [MISC American  ] participation in the [LOC Jamahurriya  ] 's development " . 
[ORG AECOM  ] 's deal also featured prominently in [PER Dorda  ] 's remarks , even though the deal was signed several days earlier and no one from the company was present . 
In a somewhat bizarre lecture clearly crafted to appeal to viewers at home , [PER Dorda  ] chided winners to take seriously the transparency and anti-corruption clauses of their respective contracts . 
Noting that he had personally blacklisted three foreign companies for unspecified alleged acts of corruption in recent months ( [ORG NFI  ] ) , he cautioned contract winners that the [ORG GOL  ] has " our methods " for " knowing what you are up to " . 
10 . 
( C ) Companies accused of paying bribes or engaging in other forms of graft would be assumed to be guilty unless able to prove otherwise , would be forced to forfeit their contracts and pay penalties , and would be summarily ejected from the country [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00001053 003.2 OF 003 and not allowed to bid on future [ORG GOL  ] contracts . 
In a seeming contradiction with the " guilty until proven innocent " assumption , [PER Dorda  ] claimed there was " no excuse " for companies not to immediately report solicitations of bribes to the [ORG HIB  ] . 
Once they had done so , it would " be the [ORG HIB  ] 's problem " to deal with. .. . 
BUT OLD HABITS DIE HARD 11 . 
( C ) On the margins of the televised meeting , [ORG Brown & Root  ] country director [PER Richard Weeks  ] ( protect ) told P/E Chief that the [ORG HIB  ] delayed providing a copy of its putative [LOC Benghazi  ] contract , and only did so on the morning of December 16 . 
Seeking to inflate the figure for the total value of contracts concluded on the day , the [ORG HIB  ] pressured [ORG KBR  ] to sign the contract without having adequately reviewed it . 
[PER Weeks  ] said [ORG HIB  ] officials took back the sole hard copy they 'd been given when they determined that [ORG KBR  ] would not sign without having their attorneys perform necessary due diligence . 
In a last-minute plea to [ORG Brown & Root  ] , P/E Chief overheard an [ORG HIB  ] official telling [PER Weeks  ] not to worry about the details of the contract because the contract itself was " meaningless " . 
" What is important is that we trust you " , the official said . 
Conceding that the remark confirmed the worst suspicions of some [ORG KBR  ] executives about the [ORG GOL  ] 's approach to the sanctity of contracts , [PER Weeks  ] said he was wrestling with whether share it with his corporate management . 
12 . 
( C ) [MISC Comment: While  ] certainly good news for [MISC American  ] business , [ORG AECOM  ] and [ORG TOCC  ] 's wins underscore that the [ORG GOL  ] , encouraged by its interactions with the [MISC French  ] and [MISC Italians  ] , continues to view commercial contracts as means by which to curry political favor . 
The new deals also represent a potentially significant evolution in the [LOC U.S.  ] business presence in [LOC Libya  ] . 
To date , [LOC U.S.  ] companies -- with the notable exception of oil and gas concerns -- have largely focused on selling discrete products and services , a relatively straightforward exercise . 
Participation in performance-based contracts represents a markedly more complicated exercise in which the potential exposure to graft , delayed payment and breach of faith are greater . 
The potential return to [LOC Libya  ] of non-official [MISC Americans  ] in numbers not seen since the early 1970 's also represents a mixed blessing . 
The people-to-people and cultural exchange potential are great and will likely be welcomed by many [MISC Libyans  ] ; however , increased numbers of [MISC Americans  ] could constitute a further irritant to ( and target for ) [MISC Islamic  ] militants already leery of [MISC U.S.-Libyan  ] reengagement .
