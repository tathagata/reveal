( C/NF ) Key points: -- [ORG Westminster seethed  ] with rumors over the May 2-4 holiday weekend that one or more members of [PER Gordon Brown’s  ] cabinet were preparing to unseat him as Prime [ORG Minister/Labour Party  ] leader following a disastrous two-week period ( Ref A ) . 
By the evening of May 4 , however , all of the potential successors had publicly declared their support for [PER Brown  ] and ruled out a challenge against him . 
-- Many of our [ORG Labour Party  ] contacts argue that the crisis was largely media-provoked , because replacing [PER Brown  ] before the next general election is next to impossible according to [ORG Labour Party  ] rules that require a would-be successor to challenge him publicly ( Ref C ) . 
Our contacts agree that there is virtually no chance that [PER Brown  ] will step down on his own , and point instead to his “resilience” in the face of the continuing onslaught of crisis and criticism he has faced during his premiership . 
-- The crisis does reflect a high degree of worry among backbench MPs that they will lose their seats in the next election if [PER Brown  ] continues his downward trend in the polls . 
These MPs therefore have increasingly less reason to follow [PER Brown’s  ] lead in Parliament on controversial issues , such as privatization of the [ORG Royal Mail  ] . 
It is likely that a weakened [PER Brown  ] will be forced to compromise on such issues in order to maintain a semblance of discipline on the [ORG Labour  ] backbench , but this is unlikely to have an effect on key [LOC UK  ] , or [LOC U.S.  ] , foreign policy priorities . 
-- [PER Brown  ] still has a chance - albeit a slim one - to win the next general election , some of our [ORG Labour Party  ] contacts argue , if he waits to call the election until the economy shows some signs of recovery . 
[PER Brown  ] could take credit for these “green shoots , ” and argue that his economic expertise makes him the best person to lead a recovery . 
-- [PER Brown  ] and [ORG Labour  ] are expected to suffer heavy losses in the June 4 elections for the [MISC European  ] Parliament and local councils . 
[ORG Labour  ] contacts tell us they worry that disaffected Labourites may turn to fringe parties such as the fascist [ORG British National Party  ] ( [ORG BNP  ] ) to cast their protest vote . 
End key points . 
Another Tempest Over Replacing [PER Brown  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Gordon Brown  ] has suffered a wretched two weeks , during which he was implicated in the “Smeargate” scandal ; suffered his first defeat in the [ORG House of Commons  ] after a massive defection of his own party members over the issue of Gurkhas’ rights ; and was forced into a public last-minute change of policy to avoid a second defeat on reform of the Second Homes Allowance for MPs ( Refs A and B ) . 
The latest polls show [PER Brown  ] and [ORG Labour  ] 18 points behind [PER David Cameron  ] and the [ORG Conservative Party  ] ; if a general election were held now , [PER Cameron  ] would win with a 150-seat majority in Parliament . 
This disastrous series of events led to rampant media speculation over the May 2-4 holiday weekend that members of [PER Gordon Brown’s  ] own cabinet , including Communities Secretary [PER Hazel Blears  ] , Health Secretary [PER Alan Johnson  ] , Justice Secretary [PER Jack Straw  ] , and Deputy [ORG Labour Leader  ] [PER Harriet Harman  ] , were ready to mount a leadership challenge to replace [PER Brown  ] . 
By the evening of May 4 , however , all four had publicly declared their support for [PER Brown  ] and ruled out any challenge against him. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) Many of our [ORG Labour  ] contacts , including [ORG House of Lords  ] Deputy Leader [PER Lord Brian Davis  ] and [ORG Special Advisor  ] to the Leader of the [ORG House of Lords  ] [PER Jonathan Pearse  ] , tell us the crisis over [PER Brown’s  ] leadership was largely due to inflated media reporting over a slow holiday weekend , while acknowledging the PM needs to “get back on message” in coming weeks . 
In any case , replacing a sitting [ORG Labour  ] PM is a daunting task , since any possible successor would have to challenge [PER Brown  ] publicly , according to [ORG Labour Party  ] rules . 
A successor to [PER Brown  ] would face the added difficulty of public pressure to call a general election as soon as s/he took office , an election that [ORG Labour  ] would have little chance of winning in the current political climate . 
So while it is [LOC LONDON  ] 00001064 002 OF 003 technically possible to replace [PER Brown  ] , a thorough study of the mechanics of doing so explains why his rivals have been so cautious in moving against him - and why getting rid of [PER Brown  ] , as unpopular as he is , might hasten Labour’s fall from power rather than prevent it . 
( Note: For more on the mechanics of replacing a sitting [ORG Labour  ] PM , see Ref [ORG C.  ] End note . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) The only other option - that [PER Brown  ] will step aside voluntarily in the face of criticism - is extremely unlikely , according to [PER Lord Davis  ] and prominent [ORG Labour  ] member [PER Lord Bruce Grocott  ] , with whom [MISC Poloffs  ] met , along with other [ORG Labour Lords  ] , on May 5 . 
In fact , they point to his personal “resilience” in the face of the continuing criticism he has endured since becoming PM , praising his rebound after Labour’s unexpected defeat in the July 2008 [MISC Glasgow East  ] by-election and myriad other political setbacks . 
This same cycle played out after that by-election defeat , in August 2008 , when Foreign Secretary [PER David Miliband  ] appeared to challenge [PER Brown  ] for the [ORG Labour  ] leadership , but then backed down ( Ref D ) . 
Then , as now , the crisis was largely made by the media , and was quickly resolved when [PER Miliband  ] disavowed any leadership challenge and publicly backed the PM . 
Backbench is Nervous Now ------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) A new and worrisome element this time for [PER Brown  ] is the defection of his backbench . 
Many of these MPs hold their constituencies by narrow margins . 
With time growing increasingly short until [PER Brown  ] must call the next election ( Embassy note: [PER Brown  ] must call an election before May 10 , 2010 , and hold it by June 3 , 2010 ) , they are growing increasingly concerned that he might not be able to turn Labour’s fortunes around . 
There is less incentive , therefore , for them to vote with their party on controversial issues such as Gurkhas’ rights , the Second Homes Allowance , or the upcoming vote on government plans to partly privatize the [ORG Royal Mail  ] , the [MISC UK’s  ] postal network . 
According to May 5 media reports , up to 100 rebel [ORG Labour  ] MPs plan to revolt against [PER Brown’s  ] plans to sell a 49 percent stake of the company to the private sector . 
New [ORG Labour  ] “modernizers” in [PER Brown’s  ] cabinet ( thought to be led by Business Secretary [PER Peter Mandelson  ] ) are said to be pushing the PM not to back down over the issue , but the left-wing of the party is urging him to shelve the sell-off and save himself from fresh humiliation , which may completely end his ability to impose any discipline on his party backbenchers . 
Aides of the PM have reportedly been considering compromise proposals to turn the [ORG Royal Mail  ] into a not-for-profit company , along the lines of the [PER BBC Trust  ] , a claim denied today by [LOC Downing Street  ] . 
How [MISC Brown Could Win  ] the Next Election ------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Brown  ] still has a chance - albeit a slim one - to win the next general election , some of our [ORG Labour Party  ] contacts argue , if he waits to call the election until the economy shows some signs of recovery . 
[PER Brown  ] could take credit for these “green shoots , ” argue that the recovery is still fragile , and that the [LOC UK  ] public does not want to risk turning to a new government that might not have the economic expertise to ensure a recovery . 
[PER Lord Grocott  ] argued that this strategy gives [ORG Labour  ] a hope of victory. “If the economy turns up in the spring , the public will want [ORG Labour  ] in power . 
They won’t want an untried [MISC Conservative  ] leadership in charge , ” he told us . 
The election , he argued , will boil down to the public’s faith in who will best manage the economy . 
[PER Lord Charles Falconer  ] , a leading [ORG Labour  ] advisor to former PM [PER Tony Blair  ] , added that if [PER Brown  ] can point to recovery , the issue for voters will be where to then make the cuts in government spending necessary to restore the country’s budget balance and “voters can be convinced those cuts should be made by a progressive , left of center government , rather than by a pro-business , [MISC Tory  ] government.” [ORG British National Party  ] May Be Stealth Victor in June [ORG EU  ] Elections --------------------------------------------- ------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) Some within [ORG Labour  ] ranks are concerned that the fascist [ORG British National Party  ] ( [ORG BNP  ] ) may be the big winner in the [ORG EU  ] Parliament and local council elections on June 4 , leading [ORG Labour  ] MP [PER Jon Cruddas  ] told us May 1 . 
Given that many [LOC UK  ] voters use the [ORG EU  ] elections to register a protest vote , [PER Cruddas  ] said no one “has any illusions but that the results will be a bloody punch to us , ” but what is a worrisome surprise are “the growing indications” that the [ORG BNP  ] will be the beneficiary of [ORG Labour  ] voters , anger with their own party , not the Tories or [MISC Liberal Democrats  ] . 
Angry [LOC LONDON  ] 00001064 003 OF 003 [MISC Conservative  ] voters who want to register a protest will vote for the [ORG UK Independence Party  ] ( [ORG UKIP  ] ) , but angry working-class [ORG Labour  ] voters turn to the [ORG BNP  ] , [PER Cruddas  ] said , and this year there are a lot of angry [ORG Labour  ] voters . 
[PER Cruddas  ] feared that voter turnout , especially among minorities , will be low , helping the [ORG BNP  ] gain [ORG EU  ] seats under the complicated proportional representation system used in the [ORG EU  ] elections . 
[PER Cruddas  ] said his constituents are battered by the recession and frustrated by competition for jobs and social services from [ORG EU  ] and non-EU immigrants . 
According to [PER Cruddas  ] , the [ORG BNP  ] will likely do well in the economically hard-hit [MISC North-west  ] in the [ORG EU  ] elections , where the party will win at least one seat for its chairman , [PER Nick Griffin  ] , and likely one more of the region’s eight [ORG EU  ] seats unless the tide is “turned” ( in the 2004 [ORG EU  ] election , the [ORG BNP  ] won 6.4 percent of the votes in the [MISC North-west  ] , but failed to win a single seat ) . 
The [ORG BNP  ] will also do “better than many expect now” in local elections in urban working class councils in [LOC Manchester  ] , [LOC Birmingham  ] and parts of [LOC London  ] , such as [PER Cruddas  ] , own constituency . 
The danger is not the brief public relations boost victory gives the [ORG BNP  ] , [PER Cruddas  ] added , but that with an [ORG EU  ] Parliamentary seat comes access to several hundred thousand GBPs in funds from the [ORG EU  ] which the [ORG BNP  ] can use in any way it chooses . 
When asked , [PER Cruddas  ] said he did not believe [ORG Green Party  ] candidates in the [MISC North-west  ] were viable alternatives that might tamp down [ORG BNP  ] support , although he acknowledged the [ORG Green Party  ] is making that argument in its campaign. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C/NF ) Other [ORG Labour  ] leaders with whom [ORG Poloffs  ] spoke acknowledged the threat of a strong [ORG BNP  ] vote in the June 4 elections but were split on how serious the threat was . 
[PER Lord Falconer  ] dismissed the idea that the [ORG BNP  ] would benefit from an anti-Labour protest vote , noting that the [MISC Conservatives  ] are , “for better or worse , ” the clear opposition party to vote for if you are unhappy with [ORG Labour  ] -- the [MISC Conservatives  ] have been out of power for 12 years . 
[PER Lord Davis  ] , on the other hand , perceived a trend toward the [ORG BNP  ] in his former [MISC Commons  ] constituency and feared that , in periods of economic downturn , extremist parties do well . 
All the [ORG Labour  ] leaders agreed , however , that a bad result in the June elections , though disheartening , was now expected , and that bad results in [ORG EU  ] elections in any case have much less impact on the [ORG Labour  ] backbenchers’ views than a by-election defeat , as was the case with last summer’s [LOC Glasgow East  ] result . 
The Lords predicted another round of media speculation on [MISC Brown’s  ] future in June , but dismissed its real impact . 
Comment ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) A wounded , but still standing , [PER Gordon Brown  ] remains at the helm of his party and is likely to do so until the voters speak in the next election , increasingly likely now to be postponed until the latest date possible next spring . 
The only viable alternative to oust [PER Brown  ] -- a delegation of [ORG Labour  ] wisemen and women advising him to leave for the sake of the party -- is not likely to occur , for the plain fact that no one expects [PER Brown  ] to step down voluntarily , no matter how savage the media and party criticism he endures . 
The man who has nursed his dream -- and grievance -- of being Prime Minister since 1994 is not going to walk out of [LOC Downing Street  ] now . 
As a [MISC Guardian  ] political journalist told [PER Poloff  ] , “Brown is a tough-skinned [PER Scot  ] , who believes dreams come true , but not free , and he will pay the personal price to keep his alive.” Visit London’s Classified Website: http://www.intelink.sgov.gov/wiki/Portal:Unit ed_Kingdom TOKOLA</pre></code>
