[PER Westerwelle Firm  ] on Removal of [ORG Nuclear Weapons  ] --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C//NF ) Formal coalition negotiations between [PER Guido Westerwelle  ] 's [ORG Free Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG FDP  ] ) , [PER Chancellor Merkel  ] 's [ORG Christian Democratic Union  ] ( [ORG CDU  ] ) and the [ORG Christian Social Union  ] ( [ORG CSU  ] ) on a coalition agreement began on October <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
[ORG FDP  ] strategist shared with [ORG Emboffs  ] and visiting Senior [LOC Germany  ] Desk Officer October 7 information on issues discussed during the first two days of these negotiations as well as the negotiations schedule and working group make-up . 
Source serves as his party 's notetaker for the negotiations and has been a long-standing close Embassy contact. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C//NF ) Source said that on October 5 negotiations included discussion on arms control in general and removal of the remaining non-strategic nuclear weapons from [MISC German  ] soil . 
He said that Federal Interior Minister [PER Schaeuble  ] argued that the weapons serve as a deterrent to [LOC Iran  ] . 
( Note: Regarding [PER Schaeuble  ] , source commented that he is " neurotic " in that he sees threats everywhere . 
He questioned whether [PER Schaeuble  ] 's influence is as great as it once was and whether he will stay in his position . 
End note . 
) According to source , [PER Westerwelle  ] asserted that nuclear weapons on [MISC German  ] soil do not serve as a deterrent against [LOC Iran  ] since they could not reach [LOC Iran  ] . 
He said that [PER Westerwelle  ] underlined that President [PER Obama  ] is moving forward toward a " nuclear-free world " and that he wants [LOC Germany  ] to be in the lead . 
Source said that Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] quipped in response that [LOC Germany  ] is not that important in this regard -- the world would hardly take notice if there were action on this matter . 
According to source , [PER Merkel  ] wanted to avoid discussion of this topic . 
Source also said that there was criticism of [ORG Social Democratic Party Foreign Minister  ] [PER Steinmeier  ] that he did not respond adequately to President [PER Obama  ] 's [LOC Prague  ] speech in which he discussed arms control . 
In response to [MISC Poloff  ] query , source said that the issue of removal of nuclear weapons is very important to [PER Westerwelle  ] and that he could well seek to include something specific in the coalition agreement . 
[LOC Turkey  ] 's [ORG EU  ] Membership ; [LOC Afghanistan  ] ; [ORG Transatlantic Relations  ] --------------------------------------------- --------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C//NF ) Source said that [LOC Turkey  ] 's accession to the [ORG EU  ] was also discussed , with general agreement that [LOC Turkey  ] is not ready for membership and could not fulfill membership criteria . 
Source said that there was agreement that no decision would have to be reached on this issue within the next four years in any case . 
[PER Westerwelle  ] also spoke against any type of automatic decision in favor of membership for [LOC Turkey  ] . 
There was also general agreement that the [ORG EU  ] is not ready for new members at this time beyond [LOC Croatia.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C//NF ) [LOC Afghanistan  ] was also an issue , but source only noted that there was general agreement on the need to continue efforts in [LOC Afghanistan  ] .

The [ORG Devil  ] 's in the Details ; What 's the [PER Rush  ] ? -------------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C//NF ) Source assessed some differences in [PER Merkel  ] 's and [PER Westerwelle  ] 's approach to the negotiations , although he also noted that the atmosphere was " very friendly and relaxed . 
" He observed that [PER Merkel  ] preferred less detail and more general provisions , whereas [PER Westerwelle  ] was interested in a detailed agreement that would guide the coalition over the next four years . 
In addition , source noted that [PER Merkel  ] is trying to push the negotiations along since she would like to have the new government in place before she travels to [LOC Washington  ] in early November and before the [ORG EU  ] summit at the end of October . 
Source indicated that [PER Westerwelle  ] might try to use [PER Merkel  ] 's desire for speed to his advantage in the negotiations . 
While he did not indicate that the [ORG FDP  ] would prolong negotiations intentionally , he noted that the [ORG FDP  ] was in no hurry to complete them . 
Ministries Divided Among Parties Last ------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C//NF ) Regarding the possible make-up of the cabinet , source said that no decisions will be made until the end of coalition negotiations and that the current membership of working groups should not be seen as an indication of who will end up in which ministry ( see ref B ) . 
Source also said that the coalition agreement may only say which ministerial posts go to which coalition parties , without any names being given . 
The names would only be provided later , perhaps after the [PER Chancellor  ] is voted in by the [ORG Bundestag  ] . 
Source noted that only two positions are certain: [PER Angela Merkel  ] will be [PER Chancellor  ] and [PER Guido Westerwelle  ] will be Vice [PER Chancellor  ] . 
He added that [PER Westerwelle  ] will most likely also become the next foreign minister . 
He then commented that during October 5 negotiations , Economics Minister zu [PER Guttenberg  ] demonstrated his interest in foreign policy and [PER Hermann Otto Solms  ] ( [ORG FDP  ] ) showed he could play an increasingly important role in the financial area . 
Source provided [ORG Emboffs  ] with the names of those serving in the plenary rounds of the negotiations and a schedule of when those rounds will take place. --Plenary Members from the CDU: Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] , Interior Minister [PER Wolfgang Schaeuble  ] , Chancellery Chief [PER Thomas de Maziere  ] , Education Minister [PER Annette Shavan  ] , [ORG CDU/CSU Caucus  ] Chief [PER Volker Kauder  ] , [ORG CDU  ] General Secretary [PER Ronald Pofalla  ] , Minister President of [LOC North Rhine-Westphalia  ] ( [ORG NRW  ] ) [PER Juergen Ruettgers  ] , Minister President of [PER Hesse Roland Koch  ] , Minister President of [LOC Lower Saxony  ] [PER Christian Wulff.  ] --Plenary Members from the CSU: Minister President of [LOC Bavaria  ] and [ORG CSU Chair  ] [PER Horst Seehofer  ] , Economics Minister Karl-Theodor zu [PER Guttenberg  ] , Head of [ORG CSU Bundestag  ] group [PER Peter Ramsauer  ] , [ORG CSU  ] Secretary General [PER Alexander Dobrindt  ] , [ORG Bavaria State Parliament  ] President [PER Barbara Stamm  ] , [PER Bavaria Plenipotentiary  ] [PER Markus Soeder  ] , [ORG Bavaria Finance Minister  ] [PER Georg Fahrenschon  ] , [ORG Bavaria Justice Minister  ] [PER Beate Merk.  ] --Plenary Members from the [ORG FDP: Party Chair  ] [PER Guido Westerwelle  ] , [ORG FDP  ] Secretary General [PER Dirk Niebel  ] , [ORG Bundestag  ] Vice President [PER Hermann Otto Solms  ] , [ORG FDP Deputy Caucus  ] Chairperson [PER Birgit Homburger  ] , [LOC Lower Saxony  ] Minister for Economics [PER Philipp Roesler  ] , [ORG FDP  ] deputy chair [PER Rainer Bruederle  ] , Deputy Minister President for [ORG NRW  ] [PER Andreas Pinkwart  ] , Deputy Chairperson [ORG Bundestag Education Committee  ] [PER Cornelia Pieper  ] , [ORG Bavaria State  ] Chairperson [PER Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger  ] . 
Comment ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C//NF ) [PER Westerwelle  ] has made the removal of nuclear weapons from [LOC Germany  ] one of his flagship issues in the foreign policy arena and has raised this in various fora in the past . 
It is not clear how hard he will push to have a specific provision on this included in the coalition agreement . 
Judging by source 's description of the discussion , [PER Merkel  ] would rather have a more general provision regarding disarmament included and preferred to avoid prolonged discussion on this issue. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C//NF ) The [ORG CDU/CSU  ] is the only party that still supports [MISC German  ] participation in the [ORG NATO  ] nuclear share and the deployment of [LOC U.S.  ] nuclear weapons in [LOC Germany  ] . 
While the [ORG CDU/CSU  ] leadership is willing to fight for the current policy , it is concerned that the ongoing [ORG Nuclear Posture Review  ] could significantly change [LOC U.S.  ] policy on the deployment of non-strategic nuclear weapons in [LOC Europe  ] , putting it at a significant political disadvantage vis-a-vis the rest of the [MISC German  ] political establishment . 
In fact , senior Chancellery officials have already requested that they be pre-notified about any possible change in [LOC U.S.  ] policy ( ref C ) . 
We expect that in these coalition negotiations , the [ORG CDU/CSU  ] may hedge their bets against a possible [LOC U.S.  ] policy change by agreeing to language that commits the next government to seek consultations on this issue at [ORG NATO  ] , with the caveat that any decision must be made by the Alliance as a whole and must take account of the large number of [MISC Russian  ] non-strategic nuclear weapons oriented against [ORG NATO  ] member states . 
Post will seek meetings with source after the plenary negotiation rounds to see if additional readouts are possible. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C//NF ) [ORG FDP  ] source is a young , up-and-coming party loyalist , who has offered [ORG Emboffs  ] internal party documents in the past . 
Excited with his role as [ORG FDP  ] negotiations notetaker , he seemed happy to share his observations and insights and read to us directly from his notes . 
He also provided copies of documents from his " negotiations " binder .
