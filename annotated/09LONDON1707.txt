( C ) Summary . 
The Prime Minister’s office released a statement July 17 affirming that “there has been no change in the [MISC Government’s  ] position on [MISC Trident  ] . 
The policy remains as set out in the 2006 [ORG White Paper  ] , and there has been no change to the timetable.” This statement was a reaction to media reports that [ORG HMG  ] planned to defer the decision , scheduled for September 2009 , to commission design plans for four new submarines to replace [MISC Britain’s  ] existing [ORG Vanguard  ] fleet , the submarine platform for [MISC Britain’s Trident  ] nuclear deterrent . 
Recent polling indicates that a majority of [MISC British  ] voters oppose replacing the [MISC Trident  ] system . 
Although [ORG HMG  ] and [ORG Conservative Party  ] leaders support replacing [MISC Britain’s Trident  ] nuclear deterrent , the challenge for the next government will not be whether or not to replace the [MISC UK’s Trident  ] nuclear weapons system -- but how to do so in light of severe fiscal constraints . 
End Summary . 
To Replace or Not to Replace ---------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( SBU/NF ) [MISC British  ] media reported July 17 that [ORG HMG  ] had decided to defer the decision scheduled for September 2009 to commission design plans for four new submarines to replace [MISC Britain’s  ] existing [ORG Vanguard  ] fleet , the submarine platform for [MISC Britain’s Trident  ] nuclear deterrent . 
Media cited an unnamed [MISC British  ] official as stating July 16 that no new money would be spent , nor would decisions be made regarding [MISC Trident  ] renewal , until after the Nuclear [PER Nonproliferation Treaty  ] ( [ORG NPT  ] ) [ORG Review Conference  ] , which will conclude in May 2010 . 
Press reports quoted the official as stating that “because of the review conference...we will delay decisions that involve spending significant sums of money until 2010.” Media analysts noted that this timeline effectively meant that no decision would be made on [MISC Trident  ] renewal until after the next [MISC British  ] general election , which must occur no later than June 3 , 2010 . 
The official reportedly said that “all our deterrent is now up for grabs but in the context of a multilateral negotiation , ” since the goals of a nuclear free world should be seen as an “aspiration.” ( [LOC Note:  ] The [LOC UK  ] [MISC Trident  ] system consists of 160 operational nuclear warheads carried by [MISC Trident  ] II ( D5 ) ballistic missiles aboard four [MISC Vanguard-class  ] nuclear powered ballistic missile submarines . 
The warheads and submarines are [MISC British  ] built , but with substantial [MISC American  ] design assistance .

( [ORG SBU  ] ) Shortly after the press reports surfaced , the Prime Minister’s [ORG Office  ] issued a clarification as follows: “There has been no change in the [MISC Government’s  ] position on [MISC Trident  ] . 
The policy remains as set out in the 2006 [ORG White Paper  ] , and there has been no change to the timetable.” A [ORG Ministry of Defence  ] spokesperson also insisted that [MISC Britain’s  ] policy was unchanged . 
Liberal [MISC Democrat  ] leader [PER Nick Clegg  ] attacked government “chaos and confusion” over renewing [MISC Trident  ] . 
[PER Clegg  ] called on PM Brown to “climb down” and admit that the missile system was not justified given equipment shortages for [MISC British  ] troops serving in [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Judith Gough  ] ( protect ) , Deputy Head of the [ORG Security Policy Group  ] at the [ORG Foreign and Commonwealth Office  ] ( [ORG FCO  ] ) told [MISC Poloff  ] July 21 that the unnamed official who had briefed the press was [PER Simon McDonald  ] , the [ORG Cabinet Office Head of Foreign and Defence Policy  ] . 
She said that press reports about [ORG HMG  ] plans to defer [MISC Trident  ] replacement design work “came as news” to [ORG FCO  ] and [ORG MOD  ] officers charged with following [MISC Trident  ] . 
She noted the PM’s office’s clarification and stressed that [ORG HMG  ] remained committed to [MISC Trident  ] and “there has been no change to the timetable.” Notwithstanding the clarification , [PER Gough  ] added that there might still be a decision to “push aside” tough fiscal decisions , such as [MISC Trident  ] , until next year -- and even after the general election . 
( [LOC Note:  ] The estimated cost of [MISC Trident  ] over the next decade is 20 billion pounds . 
End Note . 
) [PER Diana Venn  ] ( protect ) , an officer in the [ORG Cabinet Office’s Foreign and Defence Policy Secretariat  ] , told [MISC Poloff  ] July 23 that there had been a “slight misunderstanding” when [PER McDonald  ] briefed the press . 
She stressed that “Trident is not on the table...we won’t disarm unilaterally.” Weak Public Support ------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) According to an [ORG ICM  ] poll published in the center-left “The Guardian” newspaper July 13 , 54 percent of [MISC British  ] voters would “prefer to abandon nuclear weapons rather than put money into a new generation of [MISC Trident  ] warheads.” The poll found that 42 percent back renewal . 
However , another recent [ORG ICM  ] poll showed that a majority of respondents wanted to extend the life of the existing system rather than spend money to replace it . 
In a July 2006 poll , 51 percent of respondents backed renewal , while 39 percent opposed it . 
Comment ------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) Senior [ORG MOD  ] officials have privately reassured us that [ORG HMG  ] remains committed to the [MISC Trident  ] program -- and we deem it highly improbable that PM Brown will want to be remembered as the Prime Minister who abandoned [MISC Britain’s  ] independent nuclear deterrent . 
Indeed , it was a [ORG Labour  ] government ( under [PER Tony Blair  ] ) that in December 2006 issued a [ORG White Paper  ] formally opening the process to replace the [MISC UK’s Trident  ] nuclear weapons system and thereby enable the [LOC UK  ] to retain nuclear weapons well into the middle of the century . 
The [ORG Conservative Party’s  ] leadership is committed to [MISC Trident  ] , a point that Shadow Foreign Secretary [PER William Hague  ] made in an April interview when he pledged his party to upgrading the [MISC Trident  ] deterrent . 
The challenge for the next government will not be whether to renew [MISC Trident  ] -- but how to do so in the context of severe fiscal constraints . 
Indeed , in a major foreign policy speech earlier this month , [PER Hague  ] acknowledged that “extreme pressures on our own defence budget obviously necessitate a strategic defence review , which an incoming [ORG Conservative  ] government will certainly undertake.” End Comment .
