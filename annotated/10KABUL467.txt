( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: [LOC Spin Boldak  ] District in [LOC Kandahar  ] Province and its major border crossing point to [LOC Pakistan  ] at [MISC Weech-Chaman  ] have become the focus of a number of high profile coalition efforts given the upcoming military operations in [LOC Regional Command-South  ] ( [LOC RC-S  ] ) . 
Although there is a high potential for large scale revenue collections through customs collected at the border , the lack of a strong , capable district government has allowed powerbrokers , especially [MISC Afghan  ] Border Police ( [ORG ABP  ] ) Chief Colonel [PER Abdul Razzik  ] , to fill the void . 
Accused constantly of illegal trafficking and taxing activities through [MISC Weech-Chaman  ] ( most recently by a January 19 [ORG Washington Post  ] article ) , [PER Razzik  ] has been careful to maintain a cooperative relationship with the [ORG ISAF  ] leadership to guard his position . 
[ORG ISAF  ] and USG interlocutors walk a thin tightrope when working with this allegedly corrupt official who is also a major security stabilizing force . 
Despite [PER Razzik  ] 's power and influence in [LOC Spin Boldak  ] , we will press the [LOC GIRoA  ] to establish and empower competent district governance to counterbalance the powerbrokers and make [LOC Spin Boldak  ] a profitable customs hub within southern [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
As one of the 80 terrain districts , we expect it to ultimately become a focus of enhanced capacity building through the [ORG District Delivery Program  ] ( [ORG DDP  ] ) . 
End summary . 
High Level Attention -------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Reflecting the importance of [LOC Spin Boldak District  ] to the coalition effort , particularly in light of the military surge in the [LOC South  ] , COMISAF and the RC-South Commander visited the [MISC Weech  ] border crossing point on January 18 , arriving in [LOC Afghanistan  ] from the [LOC Pakistan  ] side of the border along with the head of the [ORG Pakistani Frontier Corps  ] . 
The goal of their visit was to engage [MISC Afghan  ] authorities on issues related to border security , including cooperation between the neighboring countries and [ORG ISAF  ] convoy traffic . 
Unlike the [MISC Pakistani  ] and [ORG ISAF  ] delegations , which were comprised of high-level commanding officers , the [MISC Afghan  ] contingent was led by Colonel [PER Abdul Razzik  ] , [ORG Fourth Zone  ] Chief of the [MISC Afghan  ] Border Police ( [ORG ABP  ] ) responsible for [LOC Spin Boldak  ] and local powerbroker , accompanied by the weak District Governor , [PER Haji Abdul Ghani  ] . 
No higher level [MISC Afghan  ] officials , political or military , were in attendance , a sign of [PER Razzik  ] 's apparent unquestioned -- but also unaccountable -- authority over issues pertaining to [LOC Spin Boldak  ] and its environs . 
Cost [ORG Benefit Analysis  ] --------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Razzik  ] 's apparent autonomy and connections to many influential officials , including President [PER Karzai  ] ( through former [MISC Helmand  ] governor [PER Assadullah Wafa  ] , an [MISC Achekzai  ] kinsmen and the president 's adviser on tribal affairs ) and former [LOC Kandahar  ] governor and mentor [PER Gul Agha Sherzai  ] leave him well positioned to maintain power and influence in the district . 
Additionally , he has been amenable to many of the requests made of him by [ORG ISAF  ] , including allowing his troops to partner with coalition forces . 
Requests to which he has acquiesced include support for interim improvements planned at the border crossing point intended to both expedite the increase in [ORG ISAF  ] convoys and lay the groundwork for more efficient customs generation . 
The January 18 COMISAF visit underscored [PER Razzik  ] 's key enabling role in this regard , and his calculated approach to working with [ORG ISAF.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) To this end , [PER Razzik  ] is not obstructing coalition requirements at the border ( or throughout the district ) though his longstanding disapproval of a visible [ORG ISAF  ] presence in and around the crossing point during daylight hours is well known . 
( Note: [PER Razzik  ] tells [ORG ISAF  ] that the reason for this is that the troops would become targets and result in civilian casualties . 
However , daylight is also the time of day when commercial traffic and money-making opportunities are at their peak . 
End note . 
) He knows that to reject coalition requests would be to engender unwanted ill will by [ORG ISAF  ] and , in the near term , there is money to be made in labor and materials at the border and further up Highway 4 where [ORG ISAF  ] plans to build a staging area for convoys on land near [PER Razzik  ] 's compound and owned by his associate . 
A January [ORG KABUL  ] 00000467 002.2 OF 003 18 meeting with [ORG MG Riley of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  ] provides an insight into his personal calculations: [PER Razzik  ] 's main talking point was concern that trucks providing materials to [ORG ISAF  ] in [LOC Spin Boldak  ] were not locally-owned . 
It is probably not a coincidence that he himself owns a locally-based trucking fleet . 
Abetting the [LOC Status Quo  ] ----------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Contrary to the prevailing narrative of [PER Razzik  ] 's unchallenged authority in [LOC Spin Boldak  ] , anecdotal evidence paints a picture of less than harmonious dynamics within [PER Razzik  ] 's own [MISC Achekzai  ] tribe with regard to the Colonel 's prominence . 
[PER Razzik  ] 's immediate predecessor in the [ORG ABP  ] , [PER Haji Fida Mohammad  ] ( a member of the [ORG Tribal Shura  ] and [ORG District Development Assembly  ] ) does not hide his contempt in public for his nephew . 
One local account suggests that [PER Razzik  ] did not achieve his position through a tribal consensus but that he was thrust upon [LOC Spin Boldak  ] by [LOC GIRoA  ] , a view bolstered by the Colonel 's reported links to former Governor [PER Sherzai  ] . 
District Governance ------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) At present , the [ORG District Government of Spin Boldak  ] is presided over by [PER Haji Abdul Ghani  ] , a [MISC Popalzai  ] tribesman and [PER Karzai  ] kinsman . 
The third District Governor ( [ORG DG  ] ) in two years , [PER Abdul Ghani  ] 's predecessor reportedly was removed for offending local sensibilities by pledging to tackle corruption . 
[PER Abdul Ghani  ] functions in an " acting " capacity , and recently requested coalition assistance to press [LOC Kabul  ] to make his appointment permanent . 
The [ORG DG  ] asserts that resolving his status will give him the necessary clout to properly address development needs and tackle corruption . 
However , the [ORG DST  ] 's experience to date with the [ORG DG  ] does not instill confidence that this is all that is required to improve governance . 
A broader effort to empower local authority and fill civil service vacancies will be essential to strengthening local governance and reducing the unfettered role of local power brokers in the area . 
( Note: Reported to have little more than a fourth grade education , [ORG DG  ] [PER Abdul Ghani  ] has demonstrated to the [ORG DST  ] that what he may lack in managerial capacity he may make up for in other useful character traits . 
In a November shura in the village of [LOC Luy Karez  ] , the [ORG DG  ] challenged village elders , support of the [ORG Taliban  ] . 
As reported in reftel A , the local [ORG ABP  ] commander similarly confronted elders in the same shura only to be assassinated soon afterwards . 
End note . 
) <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The other pillar of district governance is a two-headed [ORG Tribal Shura-District Development Assembly  ] ( [PER Shura/DDA  ] ) , dominated in equal measures by the [PER Noorzai  ] and [MISC Achekzai  ] tribes and their most assertive local leaders . 
Functioning as private clubs , the bodies primarily ensure that donor funds are monopolized by a select group of [LOC Spin Boldak  ] notables . 
The cooperation of the district 's two main tribes within this context belie the argument that [PER Razzik  ] , s mediation has averted inter-tribal conflict . 
As [PER Haji Fida Mohammad  ] told the [ORG DST  ] in the company of fellow [MISC Achekzai  ] and [ORG Noorzai Shura/DDA  ] members , " there are some who don't want the tribes to get along , " referring to his relative , the [ORG ABP  ] chief . 
Without an empowered District Government , however , there is little check on the self-serving actions of these institutions , which ultimately undermines equitable distribution of development resources in [LOC Spin Boldak  ] . 
[ORG District Development  ] -------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) One consequence of the interests and arrangements underpinning district security is the limited reach of development outside of [LOC Spin Boldak  ] center ( reftel A ) . 
While security , or lack thereof , contributes to the precarious state of many communities in the areas north and south of Highway 4 , district government staffing deficiencies and the absence of permanent representatives from ministries critical to district development -- specifically within the [ORG Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development  ] and the [ORG Ministry of Agriculture  ] , [ORG Irrigation  ] and Livestock ( MAIL ) -- equally hamper progress . 
Not receiving the services they need or the attention they deserve from the government , citizens outside the Highway 4 corridor , particularly in [PER Noorzai  ] tribal areas , do not see themselves as stakeholders in the district 's development and thus are more susceptible to intimidation and insurgent propaganda . 
[PER Razzik  ] regularly spins this potential for the spread of this instability to his advantage in his dealings with the coalition . 
[LOC KABUL  ] 00000467 003 OF 003 <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) A number of initiatives are underway to remedy the developmental needs of the District and the alienation of its residents . 
[ORG USAID  ] 's [LOC Afghanistan  ] Vouchers for Increased Production of [ORG Agriculture Plus  ] ( [ORG AVIPA Plus  ] ) program , for example , has the potential to play an important role in revitalizing the current state of agriculture in [LOC Spin Boldak  ] and , thereby transform perceptions of [LOC GIRoA  ] . 
A key component in realizing these end states will be the involvement of empowered local government officials beyond [ORG Razziq  ] and the [PER Shura/DDA  ] to enable equitable distribution of resources -- a dynamic that does not currently exist in the district . 
Comment ------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Colonel [PER Razzik  ] 's alleged involvement in the District 's illicit trafficking and illegal taxation on transit trade has been widely reported ( most recently in a January 19 [ORG Washington Post  ] article ) . 
His presence , however , need not forestall [LOC Spin Boldak  ] 's progress nor should it be an accepted excuse for continued neglect and underdevelopment in the district . 
By accepting the view that [PER Razzik  ] is both the guarantor of district security and the lynchpin in tribal power relations , we potentially are overlooking steps which could be taken in the near term to improve the overall state of governance and development in the district , short of removing [PER Razzik  ] . 
Additionally , by ascribing unaccountable authority to [PER Razzik  ] , the coalition unintentionally reinforces his position through its direct and near-exclusive dealings with him on all major issues in [LOC Spin  ] Boldak. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) As a first step in remedying the current imbalance of power between [PER Razzik  ] and other [LOC GIRoA  ] authorities , a public and visible commitment by [LOC GIRoA  ] to the district 's citizens is required . 
Attracting competent civil servants from key ministries should be a first step . 
[LOC Spin Boldak  ] is among the 80 key terrain districts and likely will be targeted for the [ORG District Delivery Program  ] ( [ORG DDP  ] ) by the end of 2010 . 
We will need to carefully manage eventual implementation of the [ORG DDP  ] to emplace empowered , competent government personnel and the full complement of line ministry representatives and their respective resources . 
A carefully managed approach to support the growth of a functioning district government can lay an important foundation for improved governance with or without Razzik. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 .
