( [LOC S/NF  ] ) A [MISC Turkmen  ] customs official told an [MISC Embassy  ] [ORG LES  ] on February 13 that an [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] diplomatic container with [MISC AK-47  ] 's , sniper rifles and ammunition hidden in it had been discovered one week earlier at the [PER Serdar Uli  ] ( Gaudan ) customs point in [LOC Ashgabat  ] , where vehicles and containers arriving from or bound for [LOC Iran  ] are inspected . 
The weapons were reportedly hidden underneath two [MISC Turkmen  ] carpets that the [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] was shipping to [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The [ORG LES  ] went to the [LOC Ashgabat Customs Point  ] ( a different location ) to inquire about an [MISC Embassy  ] pouch shipment arriving by truck , and an issue arose about opening the [MISC Embassy  ] 's container for inspection . 
The customs official , who is a close friend of [ORG LES  ] , then brought up the [MISC Iranian  ] container incident . 
He said that a local shipping employee of the [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] had been present when another official , acting on a " hunch that something was not right , " opened the [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] container . 
The customs official told [ORG LES  ] that the official who discovered the cache was honored for his actions and received a promotion. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) COMMENT: [LOC Turkmenistan  ] imposes stringent controls on the importation of any type of firearm , and [ORG Chiefs of Missions'  ] security detail are all unarmed . 
Even assuming that the weapons in question were intended for the [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] 's internal security , this would not explain the presence of offensive weapons such as sniper rifles , in the cache . 
The [MISC Embassy  ] has no official confirmation about the incident , which was , we note , relayed second-hand to our [ORG LES  ] . 
END COMMENT .
