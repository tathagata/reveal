05 [ORG BRASILIA  ] 437 [ORG E.  ] 05 [ORG BRASILIA  ] 369 Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: [PER Vitalmiro Bastos  ] de [PER Moura  ] , also known as [LOC Bida  ] , was acquitted by a jury of the murder of [PER Dorothy Stang  ] , an [MISC American  ] nun and naturalized [MISC Brazilian  ] citizen , on May 6 , almost exactly a year after his initial conviction . 
On May 15 , 2007 , [PER Moura  ] , a [MISC Brazilian  ] rancher , was sentenced to 30 years as the mastermind behind the shooting . 
In [LOC Brazil  ] , penal legislation guarantees an automatic appeal of any sentence over twenty years for first-time offenders . 
[PER Stang  ] was an advocate for sustainable development projects by the poor and worked to halt deforestation by loggers and ranchers . 
Her efforts earned her the hostility of landowners in the [MISC Brazilian  ] state of [LOC Para  ] , which is notorious for lawlessness and contract killings . 
Last year 's ruling was considered a landmark decision because of its high-profile and its upending of the tradition of impunity for contractors of hired-killers . 
There is speculation in the media that [PER Moura  ] bought his freedom on appeal by paying off the convicted gunman , [PER Rayfran  ] das [PER Neves Sales  ] , to change his testimony . 
[PER Sales  ] , who was also on appeal , was a principal witness against [PER Moura  ] in the first trial . 
[PER Sales  ] , sentence was upheld by the same jury . 
Although prosecutors plan to seek to annul the second trial and many in the [MISC Brazilian  ] federal government , including President [PER Lula  ] , have been critical of it , the decision reinforces [LOC Para  ] state 's reputation for lawlessness . 
End summary . 
Background ---------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Dorothy Stang  ] , an [MISC American-born  ] 73-year old nun with the Sisters of [LOC Notre Dame de Namur  ] , had been living in [LOC Brazil  ] since the 1970s , helping poor settlers gain land in the [MISC Amazon Rain Forest  ] and protecting the environment . 
She was a naturalized [MISC Brazilian  ] citizen , originally from [LOC Ohio  ] . 
She helped build schools and was among the activists who worked to defend the rights of impoverished farmers in the [LOC Amazon  ] region . 
She also attempted to halt the rampant deforestation by loggers and ranchers . 
Her efforts earned her the enmity of powerful loggers and ranchers in [LOC Para  ] , who routinely hire gunmen to harass and even kill settlers who get in their way. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) At the time of her murder ( by seven gunshots ) , on February 12 , 2005 , she was campaigning for a sustainable development project on land reform backed by the [ORG Federal Government  ] in [LOC Anapu  ] , [LOC Para  ] state , an isolated community located deep inside the [LOC Amazon  ] jungle . 
The project involved family agricultural production and subsistence level activities with low environmental impact . 
The project was being developed in an area that ranch owner [PER Moura  ] claimed . 
She was murdered by gunmen [PER Regivaldo Galvao  ] , [PER Amair Feijoli  ] da [PER Cunha  ] ( [PER Tato  ] ) , [PER Rayfran  ] das [PER Neves Sales  ] , and [PER Clodoaldo Carlos Batista  ] , all hired by [PER Moura  ] ( reftels A-E ) . 
The Appeal ---------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) During the two-day appeal , [PER Sales  ] recanted his previous testimony and stated that the weapon that he used to kill [PER Stang  ] was not provided by [PER Moura  ] according to press reports . 
Nonetheless , the jury 's decision caused immediate outrage by courtroom observers composed of lawyers and human rights activists , forcing Judge [PER Raimundo Alves Flexa  ] to interrupt final statements twice to call for silence . 
Without Sales' testimony implicating [PER Moura  ] , [PER Moura  ] 's attorney successfully argued that there was not sufficient evidence to convict his client , despite attempts by the prosecution to demonstrate that [PER Moura  ] planned to pay [PER Sales  ] and the others to kill [PER Stang  ] . 
After making his oral arguments , the prosecutor , [PER Edson Souza  ] , mentioned that he and his family had been repeatedly threatened for over a year while working on the case . 
The judge simply pointed out that a democratic state works this way and that the jury 's decision must be respected . 
The [ORG Public Ministry  ] ( prosecution ) announced that it would seek to have the second trial annulled . 
The Other Killers ----------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) In December 2005 , a jury in [LOC Para  ] state convicted [PER Sales  ] to 27 years , and his partner , [PER Batista  ] , to 18 years . 
[PER Feijoli Da Cunha  ] was also convicted to 27 years in prison for having acted as a middleman in the killing , but his sentence was reduced to 18 years because of a plea bargain in which he provided information about the other offenders . 
The fourth accused , [PER Galvao  ] , is still awaiting trial. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The Embassy has followed the case closely . 
[ORG FBI  ] agents participated in the early stages of the investigation , and [PER Sales  ] and [PER Batista  ] were indicted for murder by a [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC D.C.  ] grand jury on June 21 , 2005 . 
Embassy officials have met regularly with [MISC Brazilian  ] officials in [LOC Belem  ] and [LOC Brasilia  ] to express our strong interest in the case , and post 's [ORG Consular Agent  ] in [LOC Belem  ] , [LOC Para  ] 's capital , has been monitoring the events as they unfold , including attending this trial . 
Land Disputes and Impunity -------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Intimidation and killings of rural labor rights leaders continue to be a problem in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
The [MISC Catholic  ] Church 's [ORG Pastoral Land Commission  ] 's ( [ORG CPT  ] ) lawyer [PER Joao Batista Afonso  ] said that this case reinforces [LOC Para  ] 's deserved reputation for impunity: in over 800 rural murders committed in the past 35 years in the state , not a single person has been convicted or punished for ordering killings . 
[ORG CPT  ] reported that 25 people were killed in land conflicts last year , and has repeatedly stated that rural violence is increasing due to impunity . 
Throughout [LOC Brazil  ] over the past 20 years approximately 1,100 conflicts were registered with almost 1,500 deaths , of which only 85 were taken to trial . 
Seventy-one murderers were convicted , but only 19 were found guilty of having ordered killings. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Local press report strong government reaction against the decision noting that [ORG Supreme Court  ] President [PER Celso de Mello  ] said that the decision could stain the image of [LOC Brazil  ] 's [LOC Justice System  ] , [ORG Human Rights Secretary Paulo  ] [PER Vannuchi  ] " vehemently " disagreed with the decision , and [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Bar Association  ] ( [ORG OAB  ] ) president said that the acquittal was a " very bad " signal . 
[PER Vannuchi  ] also reported as saying that it " reinforces the feeling of impunity that is so widespread in our country , opening a road to more crime and violence . 
" Even President [PER Lula  ] is quoted as saying " as a [MISC Brazilian  ] and common citizen " he is " indignant with the result , " although " as President of the [LOC Republic I  ] don't make comments on the decision of a judicial proceeding . 
" " Let 's see what is going to happen . 
I think that this speaks a bit against [LOC Brazil  ] 's image abroad . 
" <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Stang  ] 's brother , [PER David Stang  ] , who arrived for the trial last week , was incredulous when the ruling was delivered . 
According to press reports he said , " I 'm a rational person . 
How could this happen ? 
It 's as if those killed are to continue suffering . 
" He praised that prosecution saying that their arguments were outstanding and even stronger than when [PER Moura  ] was convicted last year . 
" I 'm profoundly shocked , " he said . 
10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: [PER Moura  ] 's previous conviction was a bright spot in , and seemed to be a turning point for , the justice system in a state notorious for lawlessness and impunity . 
It also created hope that [LOC Brazil  ] 's poor history of prosecutions of land owners who order killings might be coming to an end . 
In the best case , the decision represents only a temporary setback that may well be reversed on further appeal by the [ORG Public Ministry  ] . 
If allowed to stand , however , the decision could embolden other landowners in rural disputes with indigenous ( septel ) and other groups to take matters into their own hands . 
The strong outcry from the highest levels of the GOB is a positive sign . 
Post will continue to express our interest in the case and monitor the situation .
