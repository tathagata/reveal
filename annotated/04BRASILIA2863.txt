( C ) Summary . 
Presidential Foreign Affairs Advisor [PER Marcos Aurelio Garcia  ] and his deputy , [PER Marcel Biato  ] , returned from a mid-November fact-finding mission to [LOC Haiti  ] with the strong view that [PER Aristide  ] must not be allowed back into [MISC Haitian  ] politics under any circumstances , [PER Biato  ] told [MISC PolCouns  ] in a 19 November meeting at the presidency . 
The dominant impression gathered over several days meeting with multiple sources is that [PER Aristide  ] is a criminal who should be prosecuted , but still a powerful " shadow " over [LOC Haiti  ] that inspires both terror and ill-founded hopes among many . 
Hence [PER Garcia  ] and [PER Biato  ] brought back to the [ORG GOB  ] the key assessment that the " grand strategic question " now is how to quickly create hope for the future among [MISC Haitians  ] that is decoupled from [PER Aristide  ] , and specific [ORG GOB  ] views outlined below on requirements for stability , assistance programs and political dialogue flow from that question , according to [PER Biato  ] . 
The highly negative assessment of [PER Aristide  ] by this influential advisor to President [PER Lula da Silva  ] will likely inform [ORG GOB  ] policies and actions henceforth . 
End summary . 
[PER Aristide:  ] -------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Garcia  ] and [PER Biato  ] returned from their mid-November fact-finding mission to [LOC Haiti  ] with a strong view that [PER Aristide  ] must not be allowed back into [MISC Haitian  ] politics under any circumstances , that he is " a shadow over the country " and should be " exorcised , " if possible by some form of trial in [LOC Haiti  ] , [PER Biatio  ] told [PER PolCoun  ] . 
[PER Biato  ] allowed that [PER Garcia  ] had traveled to [LOC Haiti  ] believing that [PER Aristide  ] was a political reality that might have to be considered as a factor in political dialogues . 
However , after 27 meetings with government officials , diplomats , [ORG UN  ] officials , church leaders , military sources , and moderate [MISC Lavalas  ] figures ( who would only meet with [PER Garcia  ] after he publicly denounced [PER Aristide  ] in Port au Prince ) , [PER Garcia  ] came away from [LOC Haiti  ] viewing [PER Aristide  ] as a completely unacceptable actor , " a mobster " involved in a range of illegal activity who " orders assassinations by cell phone , " [PER Biato  ] said. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Biato  ] ( strictly protect on this ) said [PER Garcia  ] 's highly negative assessment of [PER Aristide  ] is being heard by [PER Lula  ] and the senior [ORG GOB  ] leadership , and will be factored into any consideration of sending an unofficial [MISC Brazilian  ] emissary to meet with [PER Aristide  ] ( a possibility reported previously in ref a ) . 
Instead , [PER Biato  ] opined that the [ORG GOB  ] may communicate to [MISC South African  ] President [PER Mbeki  ] its concerns about the apparent freedom [PER Aristide  ] enjoys in inciting violence and provocations from his [MISC South African  ] enclave. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The " exorcism " of [PER Aristide  ] is essential because he inspires both terror and " what passes for hope " among so many in [LOC Haiti  ] 's masses , [PER Biato  ] said . 
The " grand strategic question is how to create hope for the future among [MISC Haitians  ] that is not linked to [PER Aristide  ] . 
" [PER Biato  ] said . 
From that question flow several of the specific policy and practical assessments that [PER Garcia  ] brought back from his trip , which also tend to reinforce the [ORG GOB  ] view that progress must move simultaneously in establishing stability and order , starting real political engagement , amd most importantly , bringing to bear assistance projects that have an immediate and positive effect on the population . 
Progress on all fronts needs to move ahead quickly , " because time is on [PER Aristide  ] 's side , " [PER Biato  ] said . 
Stability and Public Order: -------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOB  ] assessed that the threat to general stability appears to have diminished after " [MISC Operation Baghdad  ] " dissipated , although crime and disturbances continue . 
[ORG MINUSTAH  ] 's commander indicated to [PER Garcia  ] that force levels expected on the ground by the end of the year should be sufficient for maintaining general control , [PER Biato  ] said . 
[PER Biato  ] noted that [LOC Brazil  ] deployed a plus-up of 250 marines and support personnel , 44 vehicles ( including armored personnel carriers ) and provisions on 18 November from Rio . 
He said the [ORG GOB  ] is also planning to send an army engineering battalion for civil works projects as part of its scheduled December rotation . 
However , he stressed that the [ORG GOB  ] does not plan a substantial increase in its [ORG MINUSTAH  ] contingent , in part owing to domestic political sensitivities about the mission in [LOC Haiti.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Garcia  ] returned concerned about the overall law enforcement situation and the dysfunctionality of the national police , [PER Biato  ] said , and the [ORG GOB  ] will be trying to work with others on police training and related initiatives . 
[LOC Assistance:  ] ---------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Of the more than one billion dollars in assistance potentially available for [LOC Haiti  ] , little has started to flow , and at the current rate , the [ORG GOB  ] fears there will not be appreciable progress visible to the public before the elections , [PER Biato  ] said . 
A main challenge continues to be a lack of reliable interlocutors and institutions for turning assistance funds into viable projects , so donors are standing off , [PER Biato  ] said . 
Specific steps the [ORG GOB  ] will pursue include: --The [ORG GOB  ] will pressure the [ORG EU  ] , [LOC U.S.  ] and others to accelerate release of funds ( e.g. , the [ORG GOB  ] met with other donors on the margins of the [MISC Ibero-American  ] summit , [PER FM Amorim  ] spoke to the visiting [MISC German  ] foreign minister , [PER Garcia  ] spoke recently to [MISC French  ] officials and [PER Lula  ] will soon call [ORG EU Commission  ] President [PER Durao Baroso  ] , [PER Biato  ] said ) . --Coupled with this , the [ORG GOB  ] will urge the [ORG UN  ] to place competent aid technicians on the ground asap , headed by a senior [ORG UN  ] official experienced both in large-scale program management and dealing with the [LOC New York  ] bureaucracy , [PER Biato  ] said. --Biato said the [ORG GOB  ] is also planning to approach the [ORG World Bank  ] regarding a USD 70 million dollar loan that is available for [LOC Haiti  ] , but not released yet owing to [LOC Haiti  ] 's 50 million debt to the [ORG Bank  ] . 
The [ORG GOB  ] , in coordination with [LOC Canada  ] , plans to loan the [ORG IGOH  ] the required 50 million to pay the debt off and trigger release of the [ORG World Bank  ] loan . 
Once the [ORG GOB  ] is repaid and other adjustments are made , the [ORG GOB  ] estimates 25 to 30 million would be immediately deployable for assistance efforts. --The [ORG GOB  ] is working with [LOC Canada  ] and hopes to approach others about quickly designing and implementing joint projects in health , sanitation and utilization of such resources as [LOC Haiti  ] has , [PER Biato  ] said . 
[PER Biato  ] indicated he will approach the [ORG Mission  ] about possible [ORG U.S.- Brazil  ] joint projects when the [ORG GOB  ] has developed more specific plans , but opined that the single most dramatic [LOC U.S.  ] contribution would be an immediate adjustment of textile quotas to benefit [MISC Haitian  ] producers. --The [ORG GOB  ] alone plans to send [MISC Brazilian  ] technicians to assist [MISC Haitians  ] in enhancing their production of manioc and cashews ( the island 's main export ) . 
[LOC Brazil  ] will also build a garbage recycling facility and plans to invite other donors to support it in exporting to [LOC Haiti  ] a successful [MISC Brazilian  ] program for building affordable housing ( approximately USD 1,000 per house ) . 
Political Engagement: -------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Following [PER Garcia  ] 's visit the [ORG GOB  ] has the view that elements of the sprawling [MISC Lavalas  ] are willing to be part of a national dialogue , if [PER Aristide  ] 's intimidation efforts can be diminished and if what many [MISC Lavalas  ] members view as [ORG IGOH  ] repression is curtailed , [PER Biato  ] said . 
Opponents of [MISC Lavalas  ] also indicated to [PER Garcia  ] that there are " moderate " and " intellectual " elements in [MISC Lavalas  ] with whom they would be willing to engage . 
The [ORG UN  ] should expand on this baseline for dialogue with a series of conferences on political , economic , social and reconciliation topics , [PER Biato  ] said. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Biato  ] indicated that the [ORG GOB  ] also plans to invite a number of political figures from [LOC Haiti  ] to a December [ORG OAS  ] conference in [LOC Brasilia  ] on political party development , to provide exposure of isolated [MISC Haitian  ] political leaders to international concepts of democracy and party politics. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Garcia  ] left [LOC Haiti  ] convinced of the importance of concentrating now on election mechanics , [PER Biato  ] said . 
The [ORG GOB  ] will work with others on efforts to make [LOC Haiti  ] 's election commission functional and will send to [LOC Haiti  ] over 10,000 of [LOC Brazil  ] 's highly reliable computer voting machines . 
Political efforts of all kinds will " fall into a vacuum , " however , if there is not apparent progress on aid projects , [PER Biato  ] opined. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Garcia  ] is an influential advisor to the president and [PER Garcia  ] 's fact-finding mission to [LOC Haiti  ] produced a realistic and negative assessment of [PER Aristide  ] that , we believe , will inform [PER Lula  ] 's approach to this issue and [ORG GOB  ] actions henceforth . 
We will be attentive to the possibility that the [ORG GOB  ] may reach out to [PER Mbeki  ] to underscore their concerns about [PER Aristide  ] , and we will also be ready to discuss with the [ORG GOB  ] any specific assistance proposals they present to us for possible bilateral collaboration .
