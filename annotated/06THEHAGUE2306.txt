( C ) Summary: A parliamentary majority approved a resolution October 24 to support [ORG GONL  ] participation in the Production , Sustainment , and [ORG Follow-on Development  ] ( [ORG PSFD  ] ) phase of the [ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] ( [ORG JSF  ] ) program . 
Parliamentary approval represented the last hurdle prior to the [ORG GONL  ] 's plans to sign the [ORG PSFD  ] [ORG MOU  ] in [LOC Washington  ] on November 14 . 
End summary . 
Parliamentary Approval ---------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The [MISC Dutch  ] Cabinet had announced September 29 that [ORG GONL  ] participation in the follow-on [ORG MOU  ] was contingent on parliamentary approval . 
Parliament voted on two JSF-related resolutions October 24 . 
The first , sponsored by main opposition [ORG Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) [ORG Defense Spokesperson  ] [PER Frans Timmermans  ] , called for the [ORG GONL  ] to delay its plans to sign the [ORG JSF  ] follow-on [ORG MOU  ] until after the parliamentary elections on November 22 and subsequent formation of the new [MISC Dutch  ] government -- typically a three-month process . 
This resolution garnered support by [ORG PvdA  ] , GreenLeft , the [ORG Socialist Party  ] , and List [MISC Wilders  ] , but fell short of obtaining a parliamentary majority . 
The second motion , sponsored by [ORG CDA Defense Spokesperson  ] [PER Roland Kortenhorst  ] , supported [ORG GONL  ] participation in the [ORG JSF  ] follow-on phase . 
[ORG GONL  ] coalition parties [ORG CDA  ] and [ORG VVD  ] were joined by List [PER Pim Fortuyn  ] , [ORG SGP  ] , and the [ORG Christian Union  ] to form a majority approving [ORG GONL  ] participation in the next phase. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The vote follows several days of often contentious debate on the draft defense budget pitting Defense Minister [ORG Kamp  ] and MOD State Secretary van der [ORG Knaap  ] against [PER Timmermans  ] on [ORG JSF  ] issues . 
Central to the debate was a recent report released by the [MISC Dutch  ] equivalent of the [ORG Government Accountability Office  ] , which described [ORG GONL  ] participation in [ORG JSF  ] as fraught with financial risks , but ultimately saw no reason to withdraw from the program . 
[PER Timmermans  ] and [ORG PvdA  ] colleagues acknowledged that [ORG JSF  ] is the best available option to replace the [ORG Dutch Air Force  ] 's [MISC F-16  ] fleet , but argued in favor of buying [ORG JSF  ] off-the-shelf instead of program participation . 
[PER Timmermans  ] cited figures from the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG GAO  ] report noting that the cost of the program had ballooned to the point that continued participation would be tantamount to " " signing a blank check , " " and such money could be better spent on " " nursing homes . 
" " <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [LOC Kamp  ] and van der [ORG Knaap  ] argued the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG GAO  ] report mistakenly included operational with acquisition costs , thus " " comparing apples with oranges . 
" " They acknowledged the obvious risks associated with the program , but these risks have not changed since the [LOC Netherlands  ] intially chose to participate in the program . 
Van der [ORG Knaap  ] noted the obvious benefits program participation would have for [MISC Dutch  ] defense industry while significantly improving [MISC Dutch  ] defense capabilities . 
He also said the new [MISC Dutch  ] government could choose to withdraw from the [ORG MOU  ] following the elections . 
Sorry , [PER Charlie...  ] ----------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Perhaps faced with the increasing likelihood of a parliamentary majority in favor of [ORG JSF  ] follow-on participation , [ORG PvdA  ] released an election campaign cartoon parody depicting three party members ( [PER Attje Kuiken  ] , [PER Mei-Li Vos  ] , and [PER Nebahat Albayrak  ] ) as [PER Charlie  ] 's [ORG Angels  ] assigned by [ORG PvdA  ] Leader [PER Wouter Bos  ] to foil the [ORG JSF  ] program . 
The cartoon shows these [ORG PvdA  ] Angels snatching a case labeled " " [ORG JSF  ] millions " " from PM Balkenende just before handing it over to President [PER Bush  ] . 
Those that viewed the cartoon on the website " " [ORG YouTube  ] " " gave it two out of five stars . 
[ORG MOU  ] Signature on Course ----------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) With parliamentary approval now on the books , the [ORG GONL  ] is now set to sign the follow-on [ORG MOU  ] in [LOC Washington  ] on November 14 . 
Van der [ORG Knaap  ] and Trade Minister van Gennip plan to represent the [ORG GONL  ] at the signing ceremony .
