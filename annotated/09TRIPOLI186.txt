Cretz  ] , Ambassador , Embassy [ORG Tripoli  ] , [ORG Department of State  ] . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: [LOC Libya  ] 's nearly 500 local level councils -- " Basic People 's [MISC Congresses  ] " -- concluded their deliberations February 23 over two radical proposals put forward by [PER Colonel Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi: a plan to distribute [LOC Libya  ] 's oil wealth directly to the people , and a massive government restructuring that would eliminate most ministries . 
The weight of opinion is reportedly against the wealth distribution plan , with fears of inflation cited as the primary reason for opposing it . 
The BPCs' recommendations will be considered by the regional and national-level congresses in the coming days . 
Saif al-Islam al-Qadhafi , [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi 's celebrated reform-minded son , has formed a committee of technocrats charged with formulating plans to implement any reforms that may be adopted by the national-level General People 's [ORG Congress  ] , which is expected to convene March 2 . 
End summary . 
DESPITE EXHORTATION , ORDINARY [MISC LIBYANS  ] UNDECIDED ON WEALTH DISTRIBUTION 2 . 
( C ) On the evening of February 14 , [MISC Libyan  ] TV broadcast a meeting between [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi and Secretaries ( Minister-equivalents ) of the General People 's [ORG Committees  ] in which the Leader repeated his previous calls for [LOC Libya  ] 's oil wealth to be distributed directly to the people and for the dismantling of most government ministries ( refs A and B ) . 
In his speech , delivered on the eve of the Basic People 's Congresses' ( [ORG BPC  ] ) annual week-long deliberations , al-Qadhafi lambasted the waste and corruption endemic in the government but offered little additional detail for his vision of a new structure . 
Acknowledging that direct distribution of 3,000 dinars per month ( 2400 USD ) to [MISC Libyan  ] families could create inflationary pressures and provide a disincentive for modestly-paid government workers to continue working , he called on the [MISC BPCs  ] to debate the merits of eight basic schemes for implementing his vision , telling the cameras , " [MISC Libyans  ] , this is your historic opportunity to take your oil wealth , power , and full freedom " . 
3 . 
( C ) The 468 [MISC BPCs  ] then began their deliberations , which were played live on [MISC Libyan  ] radio throughout the week . 
The [ORG GOL  ] extended the [MISC BPCs  ] one day to February 23 after the wealth distribution question proved so contentious that other agenda items , including the government restructuring initiative , were left no time for debate . 
Local observers say the [MISC Congresses  ] have been largely inconclusive and are " in a muddle " . 
Foreign journalists on a tightly controlled tour of the [MISC BPCs  ] were surprised to see what they described as genuine opposition to al-Qadhafi 's plan , and noted that many [MISC Libyans  ] complained that they were being asked to decide on plans bereft of details and without knowledge of how the plans would impact the [MISC Libyan  ] economy . 
Even basic questions such as how the funds would be dispersed in a country that remains a cash economy with little access to commercial banking have gone unanswered . 
The most commonly-heard objection was that distributing large payments directly to the entire population would cause serious inflation . 
[PER Yusuf Sawani  ] , Director of Saif al-Islam al-Qadhafi 's [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] , told the [ORG DCM  ] his impression was that " the weight of opinion " was against supporting wealth distribution . 
The 468 [MISC BPCs  ] represent the lowest level of a three-tiered direct representation scheme ( ref C ) and the recommendations of the [MISC BPCs  ] will next pass to regional councils -- " [MISC Sha'abiyat  ] " -- before being presented to the national-level General People 's [ORG Congress  ] ( expected to meet March 2 ) . 
[MISC LIBYAN  ] EXPERTS ATTEMPT TO IMPLEMENT AL-QADHAFI'S VISION 4 . 
( C//NF ) Despite al-Qadhafi 's public exhortations that " the people " own the oil wealth and should determine how to distribute it , high-ranking [ORG GOL  ] officials have quietly begun to discuss how to implement the proposed reforms . 
Saif al-Islam al-Qadhafi and the Chairman of the [ORG Economic Development Board  ] and [ORG National Planning Council Mahmoud Jibril  ] ( who is a respected , [MISC US-educated  ] technocrat ) have established a steering committee to that end xxxxxxxxxxxx . 
The committee reportedly enjoys the support of Secretary of the General People 's Committee al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi ( Prime Minister-equivalent ) . xxxxxxxxxxxx the steering committee , comprising several [ORG GPC  ] secretaries , is still discussing plans for implementing both the wealth distribution plan and the government restructuring ; xxxxxxxxxxxx the earliest they could put forward recommendations would be June - months after the [ORG GPC  ] meetings have concluded . 
[ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000186 002.2 OF 002 5 . 
( C ) xxxxxxxxxxxx the limited capacity of the General People 's Committee secretaries is the single biggest impediment to meaningful reform . 
Even reasonable interlocutors like Secretary for Economy and Trade [PER Ali Essawi  ] , who publicly questioned the wisdom of the proposed reforms in November 2008 ( ref D ) , are not technocrats . 
Most elites owe their position to regime loyalty ( vice expertise ) and lack the education and savvy to fully understand the potential consequences of the proposed reforms and how to avoid adverse side effects . 
Conflict of interest is another problem , as several of the [ORG GPC  ] secretaries charged with developing the plans stand to lose their ministries ( and their jobs ) if they are implemented . 
Saif al-Islam 's role and his relative strength are xxxxxxxxxxxx key variables . 
Despite speculation from some quarters that his strength has been sapped by conservative regime elements - cynics cite the absence from the [ORG BPC  ] agenda of the constitution that he has championed - xxxxxxxxxxxx Saif is still actively engaged in the political-economic reform effort . 
6 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi 's calls for wealth distribution and government restructuring are a populist message intended to distance himself from the widely-criticized corruption and inefficiency in the government and place him squarely on the side of the people . 
His radical reform agenda has met strong opposition from prominent technocrats as well as self-interested officials who stand to lose influence if government ministries are abolished . 
According to many of our contacts , the debates in the local councils are genuine ( allowing al-Qadhafi to showcase his " people power " democracy to foreign journalists ) . 
The national-level General People 's [ORG Congress  ] , on the other hand , is expected to be tightly scripted from above . 
Ordinary [MISC Libyans  ] are apprehensive about their future . 
If al-Qadhafi 's reforms are adopted , they may be embarking on yet another era of economic uncertainty and social instability . 
If they had a choice in the matter , most would probably forgo the oil money in exchange for a functioning , relatively honest government that provided decent salaries , education and health care .
