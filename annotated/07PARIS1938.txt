( C ) SUMMARY: [ORG UK PM  ] Blair’s May 11 meeting with [MISC French  ] President-elect [PER Sarkozy  ] focused primarily on next steps on the [ORG EU  ] constitutional treaty in advance of [MISC Sarkozy’s  ] May 16 meeting with [MISC German  ] Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] , according to [LOC UK  ] DCM [PER Hitchens  ] ; the [LOC UK  ] hope is that the [PER Blair  ] , [PER Sarkozy  ] and [PER Merkel  ] will reach a quiet agreement on the way forward . 
He said [MISC French  ] and [LOC UK  ] positions were close on avoiding new referenda , qualified majority voting , and no social charter , but they differed on establishing an [ORG EU  ] “President.” On [LOC Turkey  ] , [PER Blair  ] had stressed the importance of not interrupting Turkey’s accession negotiations , with [PER Sarkozy  ] not clear on his intentions . 
There was little discussion of trade issues and none of [MISC European  ] defense . 
[PER Hitchens  ] surmised that [MISC Sarkozy’s  ] operating style within the [ORG EU  ] would seek to make deals with major capitals above the heads of the smaller states , and saw [ORG Sarkozy’s Mediterranean Union  ] as a way for [LOC France  ] to deal with the [MISC Turkish  ] question . 
He said it remained to be seen whether [PER Sarkozy  ] intended to act on his campaign rhetoric criticizing the [ORG European Central Bank  ] . 
Personal chemistry between [PER Blair  ] and [PER Sarkozy  ] was excellent ; the relationship with Brown will take time to build , not least because he speaks no [MISC French  ] . 
[PER Blair  ] also had a short and unremarkable meeting with [PER Chirac  ] . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG POL  ] M/C and Deputy met May 14 with [LOC UK  ] Embassy DCM [PER Tim Hitchens  ] for a readout of [ORG UK PM  ] Tony Blair’s May 11 , late-afternoon meeting with [MISC French  ] President-elect [PER Nicolas Sarkozy  ] . 
This was President-elect [MISC Sarkozy’s  ] first meeting with a foreign visitor following his May 6 election ; he had met with [PER Saad Hariri  ] the previous day . 
His first official meeting as President will occur May 16 in [LOC Berlin  ] with [MISC German  ] Chancellor [PER Angela Merkel  ] , following the transfer of power ceremony earlier that same day in [LOC Paris  ] with outgoing President [PER Jacques Chirac  ] . 
The press has speculated that the focus of both meetings is on overcoming the [MISC EU’s  ] current loss of momentum following the [MISC French  ] rejection in 2005 of the [ORG EU  ] constitutional treaty . 
( Incoming [ORG Presidential Diplomatic Advisor and National Security Advisor-equivalent  ] [PER Jean-David Levitte  ] confirmed this in a conversation with [ORG POL  ] M/C re scheduling for the Deputy Secretary . 
) MOVING THE [ORG EU  ] FORWARD --------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Hitchens  ] confirmed press reports that the discussions focused primarily on how to overcome the [MISC EU’s  ] current blockage on institutional reform . 
Blair’s main objective , he said , was to ensure that the way forward toward a new constitutional treaty would not require a referendum in the [LOC UK  ] . 
The mood of the discussions was positive , and [LOC UK  ] experts would be meeting with their [MISC French  ] counterparts in the next day or so to try to close the distance between [MISC French  ] and [LOC UK  ] positions to the greatest extent possible in advance of [MISC Sarkozy’s  ] May 16 meeting with [PER Merkel  ] . 
While [PER Sarkozy  ] would not arrive in [LOC Berlin  ] with a [MISC French-UK  ] “common position , ” the idea was that [PER Sarkozy  ] would have an understanding of [LOC UK  ] red lines . 
The hope was that , by the end of the week there would be a clear sense in [LOC London  ] , [LOC Paris  ] , and [LOC Berlin  ] about what might be possible. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG POL  ] M/C asked if [PER Merkel  ] would be speaking for the 18 countries that have ratified the current draft constitutional treaty . 
[PER Hitchens  ] responded that [PER Merkel  ] would want a deal by the end of her presidency , and the tradition was that the Presidency was forced to settle for less than it ideally wanted . 
( Comment: [PER Hitchens  ] demurred when asked whether the [MISC Germans  ] were running a less “neutral” Presidency than had the [MISC British  ] . 
End comment . 
) If all went well , the [MISC German  ] presidency would end with a mandate for intensive negotiations on a document to be approved by the end of the [MISC Portuguese  ] presidency , leaving ratification for 2008 . 
He thought it would be difficult for [LOC Portugal  ] and [LOC Slovenia  ] , as small countries , and [LOC France  ] , as the country that had rejected the [ORG EU  ] constitutional treaty , otherwise to reach a deal . 
FOUR [LOC UK  ] CONCERNS ; [PER SARKOZY  ] CLOSE ON THREE ---------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) On substance , [PER Hitchens  ] described four [LOC UK  ] “conditions” for reaching an agreement , on three of which he believed that the [LOC UK  ] and [LOC France  ] could succeed in narrowing their differences . 
First , the [LOC UK  ] would insist on an amending treaty rather than a new constitutional treaty , in order to avoid a referendum ; [PER Sarkozy  ] appeared to agree . 
Second , the [LOC UK  ] wanted less qualified majority voting than did [LOC France  ] , but [PER Hitchens  ] judged the differences as bridgeable . 
Third , the [LOC UK  ] said the [LOC UK  ] did not favor symbols which gave the impression that the [ORG EU  ] was a state , and therefore does not support an [ORG EU  ] “foreign minister.” Similarly , the [LOC UK  ] was concerned by a new [PER Sarkozy  ] proposal for an “EU President” that would go beyond the rejected draft constitutional treaty . 
( Comment: This is the first we have heard of this idea . 
End comment . 
) On [LOC PARIS  ] 00001938 002 OF 003 reflection , [PER Hitchens  ] speculated that [PER Sarkozy  ] was using the idea as a negotiating ploy that would please his [MISC French  ] domestic audience . 
Finally , the [LOC UK  ] was not in favor of a social charter . 
[PER Hitchens  ] said they believed that [PER Sarkozy  ] also was not keen on the idea , but that this was a high priority for [PER Merkel  ] . 
[LOC TURKEY  ] THE TOUGHEST NUT ----------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) On [LOC Turkey  ] , [PER Hitchens  ] described Blair’s position as wanting to ensure that Turkey’s accession negotiations would continue uninterrupted , as the [LOC UK  ] viewed the negotiations as virtuous in themselves . 
[PER Hitchens  ] acknowledged that [PER Sarkozy  ] was a fierce opponent of [MISC Turkish  ] membership , which he had made clear right away . 
[PER Hitchens  ] said the [LOC UK  ] hoped that [PER Sarkozy  ] did not perceive a political reason to cause trouble in advance of the June 26 [ORG EU  ] decision whether to open new chapters for negotiation , or that , if he chose to do so , he would make waves only in [LOC Paris  ] and not [LOC Brussels  ] . 
[ORG POL  ] M/C asked whether [MISC Sarkozy’s  ] idea of a [ORG Mediterranean Union  ] was intended as a face-saving way out . 
[PER Hitchens  ] affirmed that the initiative was primarily aimed at [LOC Turkey  ] , notwithstanding claims to the contrary . 
He added it was typical of [PER Sarkozy  ] to take a strong position on a subject , and simultaneously offer an escape route . 
[PER Hitchens  ] agreed that [LOC France  ] also saw a benefit in a [MISC Mediterranean  ] vocation as a way to balance Germany’s ties in [LOC Eastern Europe  ] . 
LITTLE ON TRADE --------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Hitchens  ] said there was no in-depth discussion of trade . 
He said the [LOC UK  ] supported the role of [ORG EC  ] Commissioner [PER Mandelson  ] , whereas [PER Sarkozy  ] had argued that it was illegitimate for an unelected Commissioner to negotiate on behalf of [LOC Europe  ] . 
Otherwise the discussion was unsurprising ; or it was surprising only in the sense that [PER Sarkozy  ] presented a “normal” [MISC French  ] position , i.e. , consistent with what [PER Chirac  ] would have said . 
He allowed that the [LOC UK  ] had been hoping for signs of more flexibility , and suggested that the [LOC UK  ] would want to revisit this topic once a new government was formed . 
NO ESDP ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) On [MISC European  ] defense , [PER Hitchens  ] noted that , surprisingly , there had been no discussion . 
[PER SARKOZY  ] AND [LOC EUROPE  ] ------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Asked about the impact of [PER Sarkozy  ] on [LOC Europe  ] more generally , [PER Hitchens  ] expressed hope for a better [MISC UK-French  ] working relationship , although he hastened to add that [MISC UK-French  ] relations would never threaten to overtake the [MISC Franco-German  ] tandem . 
Indeed , the [LOC UK  ] hoped for good trilateral cooperation between [MISC Europe’s  ] main powerhouses . 
[PER Hitchens  ] thought there was a risk that [PER Sarkozy  ] would make deals with “other major” interlocutors such as the [LOC UK  ] or [LOC Germany  ] , without taking adequate account of the views of the smaller states ; he described [PER Sarkozy  ] as “not good at dealing with unimportant people.” [PER Hitchens  ] said [PER Sarkozy  ] would discover that he did not like [MISC European  ] diplomacy with its emphasis on process and consensus . 
The [LOC UK  ] was waiting with bated breath to see what kind of attitude [PER Sarkozy  ] would take toward the [ORG European Central Bank  ] now that the election campaign was over . 
On a more “political” [LOC Europe  ] , [PER Hitchens  ] predicted that [PER Sarkozy  ] would want above all to put [LOC France  ] back at the heart of [MISC European  ] decision-making , although the [MISC UK’s  ] main priority was that the [MISC French  ] economy do better . 
While a more successful [LOC France  ] might mean a more difficult [LOC France  ] , this was still unquestionably preferable to an unsuccessful [LOC France  ] . 
ORIGINS OF MEETING ------------------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Hitchens  ] said the idea of a meeting came up during one of Blair’s and [MISC Sarkozy’s  ] phone conversations , with [PER Blair  ] offering to meet [PER Sarkozy  ] at a venue to be determined . 
Once it became clear that it would be [LOC Paris  ] , [PER Blair  ] also arranged a meeting with President [PER Chirac  ] . 
The [MISC British  ] were frankly surprised that [PER Sarkozy  ] agreed to see [PER Blair  ] before [PER Merkel  ] , although [MISC Sarkozy’s  ] trip to [LOC Berlin  ] would be his first official visit . 
Noting that it was a pity that [MISC French  ] and [MISC British  ] timing were not in synch -- [PER Blair  ] would be leaving as [PER Sarkozy  ] arrived -- the meeting also made sense as a way for the [MISC British  ] to make up for the fact that their government would change in a few weeks , and thus would “fall behind” other [MISC European  ] countries in engaging with the new [MISC French  ] government . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] was accompanied at the meeting by likely PM [PER Francois Fillon  ] and [MISC Sarkozy’s  ] chief of staff , [PER David Martinon  ] ( to be the [ORG Presidential  ] spokesman ) . 
The interpreter who came was not needed: as is customary , theirmeeting was entirely in [MISC French  ] . 
[LOC PARIS  ] 00001938 003 OF 003 SARKOZY-BLAIR , -MERKEL , -BROWN ------------------------------ <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Hitchens  ] said the chemistry between [PER Blair  ] and [PER Sarkozy  ] was good , much because they related to each other as politicos . 
Over the years , they have enjoyed comparing notes on party organization , how to work with labor and business , and how to appeal to the extremes . 
( Note: The suggestion was that [PER Sarkozy  ] may have learned quite a little from [PER Blair  ] on this score . 
) [PER Hitchens  ] noted that [PER Sarkozy  ] also traveled frequently to [LOC London  ] with his wife for personal reasons . 
[PER Hitchens  ] suggested that , while [PER Blair  ] and [PER Merkel  ] talked frequently , their different personalities ( she was far less outgoing ) made for a more distant relationship . 
But [PER Blair  ] had great respect for her , based on the “brilliant hand” she had played during the [MISC EU’s  ] budget discussions . 
[PER Hitchens  ] hinted that [PER Sarkozy  ] would not immediately get on as well with [PER Brown  ] as he had [PER Blair  ] , if only because [PER Brown  ] did not speak [MISC French  ] . 
MEETING WITH [PER CHIRAC  ] ------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Hitchens  ] described Blair’s meeting with [PER Chirac  ] as uneventful . 
[PER Chirac  ] spoke as an old friend , noting that the [LOC UK  ] and [LOC France  ] sometimes differed while praising their cooperation on climate change and [LOC Africa  ] . 
[PER Hitchens  ] noted that [PER Blair  ] and [PER Chirac  ] would probably continue to cross each other’s paths in the future , as both of them were setting up foundations to deal with these same issues .
