End summary . 
Boost to [ORG Party Legitimacy...  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The central leadership views the recent [MISC Beijing-hosted Olympics  ] as a great success that has given the regime a boost in legitimacy , according to numerous contacts we spoke with in the days following the August 24 closing ceremony . 
[PER Dong Lisheng  ] ( protect ) , a political scientist at the [ORG Chinese Academy of Social Sciences  ] , told [MISC PolOff  ] the [MISC Games  ] " far exceeded " the expectations of top-level [ORG Party  ] leaders , who welcomed the public 's nationalistic response as a boost for [ORG Party  ] legitimacy . 
Freelance journalist [PER Chen Jieren  ] ( protect ) , who is the nephew of [ORG Politburo Standing Committee  ] member [PER He Guoqiang  ] , said " 70 percent " of the public supported the [MISC Games  ] . 
For most [MISC Chinese  ] , [PER Chen  ] said , the [MISC Olympics  ] were about " standing up " and winning the world 's respect and were thus successful . 
[PER Chen Hao  ] ( protect ) , Executive Editor-in- Chief of the [ORG International Herald Leader  ] , a newspaper run by the [ORG Xinhua News Agency  ] , said the [MISC Olympics  ] represent a clear " political achievement " ( zheng ji ) for the [ORG Party that  ] will make it easier for the central leadership to implement its policies in the coming months . 
Professor [PER Su Hao  ] ( protect ) , of [ORG China Foreign Affairs University  ] ( [ORG CFAU  ] ) , offered a similar assessment , saying that the success of the [MISC Games  ] resulted in a " large boost in legitimacy " for the government and a surge of national pride. ...but Resentment over Costs ---------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) While contacts generally agreed the [MISC Olympics  ] will boost public support for the [ORG Communist Party  ] , many of our interlocutors cautioned that any legitimacy gains are diluted by wide-spread criticism over the excessive expense of hosting ( which was announced as over [ORG USD  ] 40 billion , including infrastructure investment ) . 
[PER Wu Yin  ] ( protect ) , Vice President of the public opinion polling firm [ORG Horizon  ] , told [MISC PolOff  ] August 28 that many Beijingers believe hosting the [MISC Olympics  ] has accelerated the rise in fuel and food prices . 
Strict security , [PER Wu  ] continued , dampened public enthusiasm during the [MISC Games  ] and there is lingering disappointment that the much-anticipated economic benefits to [LOC Beijing  ] 's service industry failed to materialize . 
In the end , [PER Wu  ] argued , gains in public support for the [ORG Party  ] will be minimal , at best . 
[PER Guan Renfeng  ] ( protect ) , a graduate student at [ORG Xinjiang University  ] who visited [LOC Beijing  ] during the final weekend of the [MISC Games  ] , told [MISC PolOff  ] August 25 that he is proud of his country 's [MISC Olympics  ] effort but he gives the government an " A minus " rather than an A " because they spent too much money . 
" Guangming Ribao editor [PER Dong Yuyu  ] ( protect ) commented that while the majority of [MISC Chinese  ] " reflexively " support the [MISC Olympics  ] and feel proud , the public feels uneasy about excessive government spending . 
[PER Dong  ] said many [MISC Chinese  ] , had they been given a choice , would have supported spending these resources on education and health care rather than hosting the [MISC Olympics  ] . 
[PER Niu Xinchun  ] ( protect ) , a scholar at the [ORG Ministry of State Security-affiliated Chinese Institutes of Contemporary International Relations  ] ( [ORG CICIR  ] ) , told [MISC PolOff  ] August 25 that a " significant portion " of the [MISC Chinese  ] public resents [LOC BEIJING  ] 00003385 002 OF 002 the enormous costs of hosting the [MISC Games  ] . 
[ORG CFAU  ] 's [ORG Su  ] , however , felt such concerns over spending are overblown , noting that the cost of the [MISC Olympics  ] was just a small percentage of [LOC China  ] 's total GDP . 
Central Dissatisfaction with [ORG BOCOG  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Ding Kuisong  ] ( protect ) , Vice Chairman of the [ORG CCP Party  ] School-affiliated think tank [ORG China Reform Forum  ] , said [ORG Politburo Standing Committee  ] ( [ORG PBSC  ] ) Member and Vice President [PER Xi Jinping  ] was placed in charge of the overall [MISC Olympics  ] effort due , in part , to high- level dissatisfaction with missteps by the [ORG Beijing Organizing Committee  ] for the [MISC Games  ] of the 29th [MISC Olympiad  ] ( [ORG BOCOG  ] ) . 
[ORG BOCOG  ] 's alleged mistakes included agreeing " without sufficient coordination " to global torch relay routes that were " inappropriate . 
" [PER Ding  ] said [PER Xi  ] , and even [ORG CCP General Secretary  ] [PER Hu Jintao  ] , personally made many [MISC Olympics-related  ] decisions , including logistical arrangements for President [PER Bush  ] 's attendance at the opening ceremony . 
Dissident scholar [PER Liu Junning  ] ( protect ) , told [ORG PolOff September  ] 2 that he , too , had heard of tension between [ORG BOCOG  ] and the central leadership over the torch relay fiasco , but [PER Liu  ] said it was always the plan to have the Central Government take the lead role in the final weeks . 
[MISC Olympic Victory  ] for [PER Xi Jinping  ] , [PER Zhou Yongkang  ] --------------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Chen Jieren  ] told [MISC PolOff  ] that both [PER Xi Jinping  ] and fellow [ORG PBSC  ] member [PER Zhou Yongkang  ] , who is in charge of [LOC China  ] 's security apparatus , benefited politically from the [MISC Games  ] . 
Overseeing the [MISC Olympics  ] was the first major assignment for [PER Xi  ] since being promoted to the [ORG PBSC  ] in October 2007 . 
While [PER Chen  ] said that some of [PER Xi  ] 's rivals at the top may have secretly hoped that [PER Xi  ] would stumble , the success of the [MISC Games  ] has , in fact , burnished [PER Xi  ] 's image . 
[PER Zhou Yongkang  ] , meanwhile , is now " exceptionally powerful , " [PER Chen  ] said . 
[PER Zhou  ] had already received a great deal of praise following the [LOC Sichuan  ] earthquake due to the quick response of security forces , [PER Chen  ] explained , and the lack of a major security incident at the [MISC Olympics  ] further strengthened [PER Zhou  ] 's standing . 
[PER Dong Lisheng  ] , of [LOC CASS  ] , largely echoed [PER Chen  ] 's comments , saying [PER Xi  ] passed his first major test as a top-level leader . 
[PER Hu Jintao  ] and Collective Leadership the [MISC Real Winners ---------------------------------------------  ] ------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Guangming Ribao editor [PER Dong Yuyu  ] concurred that [PER Zhou  ] is very powerful and his stock is rising because of his performance over the last year and during the [MISC Olympics  ] . 
However , [PER Dong  ] did not agree that [PER Xi Jinping  ] 's political stature had risen as a result of his [MISC Olympics  ] assignment . 
According to [PER Dong  ] , the [ORG Party 's Central Secretariat  ] assumed overall management of the [MISC Games  ] and it was " natural " for [PER Xi  ] , as head of the [ORG Secretariat  ] , to take the leading role . 
Moreover , [PER Xi  ] still coordinated all [MISC Olympic  ] decisions with the rest of the [ORG Politburo Standing Committee  ] . 
If anything , [PER Dong  ] argued , the [MISC Olympics  ] was a " collective " triumph for the [ORG entire Party  ] leadership , not just [PER Xi  ] . 
[PER Liu Junning  ] agreed , saying [PER Hu Jintao  ] , not [PER Xi Jinping  ] , is the main beneficiary of the [MISC Olympics  ] given [PER Hu  ] 's prominence during the [MISC Games  ] . 
( Note: In addition to hosting world leaders and presiding over the opening ceremony , [PER Hu  ] made high-profile appearances at several events . 
) " It was clear to everyone that [PER Hu Jintao  ] was the real host of the [MISC Olympics  ] , " [PER Liu  ] said .
