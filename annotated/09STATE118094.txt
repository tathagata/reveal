( B ) and ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) This is an action request for [ORG Embassy Brasilia  ] . 
Please see paragraphs 5-6. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Summary . 
The [ORG Department requests Embassy Brasilia  ] persuade [MISC Brazilian  ] officials to use the expected November 23 visit of [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  ] to [LOC Brazil  ] to urge [LOC Iran  ] 's constructive engagement with the five permanent members of the [ORG Security Council  ] and [LOC Germany  ] ( [ORG P5+1  ] ) on its nuclear program , its full compliance with [ORG UN Security Council  ] resolutions and its assistance in freeing unjustly imprisoned [MISC American  ] citizens . 
End Summary . 
OBJECTIVES ---------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Post should persuade highest appropriate officials to advance the following objectives during [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's visit: --Encourage [LOC Iran  ] 's engagement with the [ORG P5+1  ] on its nuclear program , specifically: --Urge [LOC Iran  ] to accept the [ORG IAEA  ] 's offer , supported and guaranteed by [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC France  ] , and the [LOC United States  ] , to provide fuel for the [ORG Tehran Research Reactor  ] ( [ORG TRR  ] ) in exchange for a portion of [LOC Iran  ] 's existing stockpile of [ORG Low Enriched Uranium  ] ( [ORG LEU  ] ) ; and --Highlight the opportunity for [LOC Iran  ] to improve its international relations , including with the [LOC United States  ] , by committing to an urgent and regular process of dialogue with the [ORG P5+1  ] on the issues surrounding [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program and other issues that [LOC Iran  ] wishes to raise. --Press for [MISC Iranian  ] compliance with all [ORG UN Security Council  ] and [ORG IAEA  ] requirements on its nuclear program. --Urge the speedy release of [MISC American  ] citizens unjustly held in [LOC Iran  ] . 
If raised by the [MISC Brazilians  ] , post should discourage [MISC Brazilian  ] support for any alternatives to refuel the [ORG TRR  ] that do not feature the removal of [ORG LEU  ] from [LOC Iran  ] . 
Such alternatives would undermine international efforts to build confidence in [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program . 
Under Secretary [PER Burns  ] will also pursue these objectives with [PER U/S Machado  ] during her visit to [LOC Washington  ] on November 16 . 
DEADLINE -------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) Please report results by November 20 . 
BACKGROUND ---------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Post may draw on the following background points in working with the [MISC Brazilian  ] government: General Overview ---------------- -- Since President [PER Obama  ] took office , he has made clear the willingness of the [LOC United States  ] to engage with [LOC Iran  ] and to launch a new relationship based on mutual respect and recognition of each other 's interests . 
-- He has authorized the United [MISC States'  ] full participation in diplomatic discussions between the five permanent members of the [ORG Security Council  ] and [LOC Germany  ] and [LOC Iran  ] without pre-conditions . 
-- The [LOC United States  ] has stated its support for [LOC Iran  ] 's full right to a civilian nuclear program within [ORG IAEA  ] guidelines , provided [LOC Iran  ] meets its international obligations and carries out its responsibilities within the NPT framework . 
-- As a way to build confidence , the [LOC United States  ] , with [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC France  ] , has also supported the [ORG IAEA  ] 's proposal to respond positively to [LOC Iran  ] 's request for nuclear fuel for the [ORG Tehran Research Reactor  ] ( [ORG TRR  ] ) , in spite of [LOC Iran  ] 's continuing violation of [ORG UNSC  ] resolutions and noncompliance with [ORG IAEA  ] requirements on its nuclear program . 
-- However , almost one year into the [PER Obama  ] administration , [LOC Iran  ] has not taken practical , concrete steps that would begin to create confidence in its nuclear intentions . 
Iran: o Continues to enrich uranium despite [ORG UNSC  ] requirements that it suspend such operations ; o Revealed it had been building a secret uranium enrichment facility at a military base near [LOC Qom  ] , in violation of its safeguards agreement ; o Continues to refuse cooperation with the [ORG IAEA  ] in addressing the full range of [ORG IAEA  ] questions about the peaceful purposes of its nuclear program ; o Has not accepted the [ORG IAEA  ] proposal to refuel the [ORG TRR  ] ; and o Since meeting with representatives of the five permanent members of the [ORG Security Council  ] and [LOC Germany  ] in [LOC Geneva  ] on October 1 , has refused all subsequent efforts to schedule another meeting to discuss its nuclear program . 
-- [LOC Iran  ] 's failure to take advantage of these numerous opportunities raises serious questions about the intentions of its nuclear program that deserve urgent international attention . 
Background on the [ORG Tehran Research Reactor  ] ----------------------------------------- -- The [ORG IAEA  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC France  ] , and the [LOC United States  ] cooperated closely and flexibly to find a way to respond positively to [LOC Iran  ] 's request for fuel for the [ORG Tehran Research Reactor  ] ( [ORG TRR  ] ) so that it could keep running to meet medical needs beyond 2010 . 
-- The [ORG TRR  ] refueling proposal offers [LOC Iran  ] the opportunity to convert its stockpile of low enriched uranium ( [ORG LEU  ] ) into higher-enriched fuel with the help of [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC France  ] . 
The proposal 's elements are simple: o [LOC Iran  ] would transfer a portion of its [ORG LEU  ] necessary for fuel production in one batch to [ORG IAEA  ] custody outside of [LOC Iran  ] before the end of the year ; o [LOC Russia  ] would further enrich the [ORG LEU  ] to meet fuel requirements ; and o [LOC France  ] would fabricate the fuel assemblies and return them to [LOC Iran  ] before [LOC Iran  ] 's fuel supplies are depleted before the end of the year . 
-- In addition , the [LOC United States  ] expressed a commitment to work with the [ORG IAEA  ] to improve safety and control features at the [ORG TRR  ] . 
-- The [LOC United States  ] , [LOC France  ] , and [LOC Russia  ] took great political risks in supporting the deal , especially in light of [LOC Iran  ] 's continuing violation of successive [ORG UNSC  ] resolutions and [ORG IAEA  ] requirements , including its secret construction of a uranium enrichment facility near [LOC Qom  ] , and its continuing enrichment operations . 
-- We did so because the arrangement would begin to build confidence and would give [LOC Iran  ] and the international community more time to reach a comprehensive negotiated solution to [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program , while fulfilling [LOC Iran  ] 's humanitarian needs . 
-- When [LOC Iran  ] expressed concern about the reliability of the proposal , the [LOC United States  ] and its partners expressed to the [ORG IAEA  ] a willingness to address [LOC Iran  ] 's concerns , including through: o a [LOC U.S.  ] offer to formally join the deal as a signatory ; o a readiness of the five permanent members of the [ORG Security Council  ] and [LOC Germany  ] to guarantee the deal through a political statement of support ; o a willingness to help secure finance for the movement of the [ORG LEU  ] and fuel ; o an openness to move the [ORG LEU  ] to any number of locations outside of [LOC Iran  ] ; and o a willingness to support the [ORG IAEA  ] 's holding material equivalent to the fuel in escrow as a guarantee for [LOC Iran  ] of the fuel 's ultimate delivery . 
-- After reaching an agreement in principle in the deal following talks with the [LOC E3+3  ] in [LOC Geneva  ] on October 1 , and following further technical discussions at the [ORG IAEA  ] October 19-21 , [LOC Iran  ] has failed to accept the deal to date . 
[LOC Iran  ] 's Intentions ----------------- -- This raises a question about [LOC Iran  ] 's intentions . 
If [LOC Iran  ] is enriching uranium to meet its civilian reactor fuel needs , why would it not accept an international offer ( with significant guarantees ) to provide its [ORG LEU  ] for fuel to power the [ORG TRR  ] to meet its humanitarian needs , particularly since [LOC Iran  ] does not have the capability to produce the reactor fuel on its own ? 
-- This question is troubling in the context of [LOC Iran  ] 's continued enrichment activities in defiance of [ORG UNSC  ] resolutions ; its secret construction of an enrichment facility on a military base near [LOC Qom  ] ; its refusal to cooperate with the [ORG IAEA  ] in answering questions about the peaceful nature of its nuclear program ; and its refusal to meet with the five permanent members of the [ORG Security Council  ] . 
-- Together with our [ORG P5+1  ] partners , the [LOC United States  ] informed [MISC Iranian  ] representatives in [LOC Geneva  ] on October 1 of our willingness to discuss any items of concern to [LOC Iran  ] -- both bilaterally and multilaterally -- in addition to our concerns about [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program . 
-- On October 1 , [LOC Iran  ] 's representatives committed to meet again before the end of the month based on an agenda that included [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program . 
Since that time , however , the [MISC Iranian  ] government has refused all invitations to meet if its nuclear program would be on the agenda . 
-- [LOC Iran  ] 's continued refusal to engage on its nuclear program with the [ORG P5+1  ] or in any other forum deepens our concerns about [LOC Iran  ] 's intentions for its nuclear program . 
Background on Imprisoned [MISC American  ] Citizens ----------------------------------------- 6 . 
( U ) Since July 31 , [LOC Iran  ] has detained three [MISC American  ] citizens ( [PER Joshua Fattal  ] , [PER Shane Bauer  ] , and [PER Sarah Shourd  ] ) who were hiking in [LOC Northern Iraq  ] when they apparently wandered by mistake into [LOC Iran  ] in a poorly marked border area . 
It is unclear what , if any , formal charges have been filed against them . 
As Secretary [PER Clinton  ] has said: " We believe strongly that there is no evidence to support any charge whatsoever . 
And we would renew our request on behalf of these three young people and their families that the [MISC Iranian  ] government exercise compassion and release them , so they can return home . 
" The [ORG Department has  ] repeatedly called upon [LOC Iran  ] to release all other [MISC American  ] citizens who are either missing or being unjustly detained in [LOC Iran  ] . 
Q/A --- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) Post may draw on following guidance in responding to any counter-arguments or questions from the [MISC Brazilian  ] government . 
-- In the [ORG TRR  ] proposal , why must [LOC Iran  ] surrender all of its [ORG LEU  ] in one batch , and why must it be before the end of the year ? o The [ORG TRR  ] proposal was developed both to supply [LOC Iran  ] with the fuel required for the continued operation of the reactor and also as a measure to build confidence in [LOC Iran  ] 's peaceful intentions and its seriousness to negotiate. o By agreeing to the transfer of 1200 kilograms of [ORG LEU  ] ( enough to equal the last fuel supply agreement [LOC Iran  ] signed for the reactor with [LOC Argentina  ] in the early 1990s ) , we aimed to lessen international concerns that [LOC Iran  ] was attempting to create a stockpile of uranium to contribute to an eventual breakout from the [ORG NPT  ] . 
This would consequently allow more time for negotiations on the broader nuclear file. o The transfer by the end of the year is needed to ensure that [LOC Iran  ] receives the fuel required for the reactor before December 2010 , when the reactor will run out and be forced to shut down . 
-- What risk does the [ORG LEU  ] stored in [LOC Iran  ] pose to the international community ? 
Isn't it under full [ORG IAEA  ] monitoring ? o Yes , this [ORG LEU  ] is currently under [ORG IAEA  ] safeguards. o However , given [LOC Iran  ] 's long history of [ORG IAEA  ] safeguards violations and [ORG NPT  ] noncompliance , the international community cannot trust that [LOC Iran  ] will not interfere with [ORG IAEA  ] monitoring or withdraw from [ORG IAEA  ] safeguards or the [ORG NPT  ] altogether. o This project will remove an immediate source of concern and establish some confidence in [LOC Iran  ] 's peaceful intent and willingness to comply with its obligations. - - How can [LOC Iran  ] be sure it will ever receive the fuel assemblies for the [ORG TRR  ] in the current international environment , in which many openly seek to diminish [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear capacity ? o We and our partners have each made political commitments at the highest levels to the fulfillment of this project . 
Should [LOC Iran  ] agree to it , [LOC Iran  ] will receive the fuel required. o All participants in this project are taking risks . 
[LOC Iran  ] stands in violation of the [ORG NPT  ] , its [ORG IAEA  ] safeguards agreement , and three [ORG Chapter VII UNSC  ] resolutions . 
This project offers [LOC Iran  ] an opportunity to establish confidence in its peaceful intentions , a confidence that has eroded due to [LOC Iran  ] 's continued non-compliance . 
-- [LOC Iran  ] suspended enrichment once before in response to international demands , and received no benefit . 
Why should [LOC Iran  ] trust the international community now ? o [LOC Iran  ] 's suspension of uranium enrichment and other activities in the past was intended to support a diplomatic process . 
Unfortunately , [LOC Iran  ] terminated that diplomatic process in August 2005 by abandoning suspension. o However , prior to that point , [LOC Iran  ] 's temporary suspension avoided its being reported to the [ORG UN Security Council  ] and the sanctions that would have likely come along with that report. o The requirement of suspension imposed by the [ORG UNSC  ] in resolution 1737 is intended to restore that diplomatic process and to lead to a final resolution of international concerns with [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program. o This was codified in [LOC UNSCR  ] 1737 when the [ORG UNSC  ] stated its intention to suspend implementation of the measures adopted by the [ORG UNSC  ] if [LOC Iran  ] returned to negotiations through suspension of its nuclear and related activities. o Trust is in short supply on both sides . 
It is for that reason that we have offered [LOC Iran  ] several opportunities for reciprocal , confidence-building steps ( e.g. , " freeze for freeze " and the [ORG TRR  ] proposal ) . 
-- Why is there not equal attention to [LOC Israel  ] 's nuclear status ? 
Does it not also destabilize the region ? o The [LOC United States  ] has long pressed for universal adherence to the [ORG NPT  ] treaty and will continue to urge all states that have not done so to join the Treaty and accept the full-scope [ORG IAEA  ] safeguards on all of their nuclear activities. o It is extremely difficult , however , to persuade a state that [ORG NPT  ] adherence is in its security interest when its neighbors are in violation of their own [ORG NPT  ] obligations , and when the international community has not demonstrated the political will necessary to enforce compliance. o [LOC Iran  ] 's failure to comply with its [ORG NPT  ] and [ORG IAEA  ] obligations bears out these concerns and undermines attempts to secure universal adherence to the [ORG NPT  ] . 
It became a party to the treaty and proceeded to violate its obligations for over twenty years , presenting a fundamental threat to the entire nonproliferation regime. o Returning regional states to full compliance with their [ORG NPT  ] obligations would remove a serious obstacle to [ORG NPT  ] adherence by all states in the region. o An [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear weapons capability also serves as a destabilizer in the region , possibly triggering proliferation across the [LOC Gulf  ] in response to a mounting threat posed by [LOC Iran  ] . 
Not only does this undermine the entire nuclear nonproliferation regime , but risks further instability in the region . 
-- How can you say that the [LOC Qom  ] facility was secret , when it was [LOC Iran  ] that announced its existence and invited [ORG IAEA  ] inspectors to visit ? o [LOC Iran  ] was required to declare the existence of this facility to the [ORG IAEA  ] the moment the decision was made to construct it , not several years into its construction . 
This is a requirement of [LOC Iran  ] 's [ORG IAEA Safeguards Agreement  ] ( contained in Code 3.1 of the [ORG Subsidiary Arrangement to Iran  ] 's [ORG Safeguards Agreement  ] ) . o This code was modified after revelations surrounding [LOC Iraq  ] 's nuclear program were made in the early 1990s. o [LOC Iran  ] was the last state to agree to the revised code , but it did so in March 2003 . 
[LOC Iran  ] attempted to revert to the early form of the code ( which requires notification only 180 days prior to the introduction of nuclear to the facility ) in March 2007 . 
The [ORG IAEA  ] consistently has denied that [LOC Iran  ] has the legal ability to make such a change. o We also believe that [LOC Iran  ] made the decision to declare the facility not to conform to its legal obligations , but because it had become aware that the secrecy of the facility had been compromised . 
-- Why should [LOC Iran  ] discuss its nuclear program with the self-appointed [MISC E3+3  ] ? 
Isn't the [ORG IAEA  ] the proper place for [LOC Iran  ] to engage on its nuclear program with the international community ? o We welcome [LOC Iran  ] 's engagement with the [ORG IAEA  ] . 
But despite its rhetoric , [LOC Iran  ] has not engaged with the [ORG IAEA  ] . 
[LOC Iran  ] has refused for several years to answer the [ORG IAEA  ] 's questions ( even before the [ORG IAEA  ] reported [LOC Iran  ] to the [ORG UNSC  ] for its myriad violations of its international obligations ) . o The [MISC E3+3  ] mechanism evolved as a means to negotiate a solution precisely because [LOC Iran  ] was refusing to engage with the [ORG IAEA  ] on the concerns regarding [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program . 
-- [LOC Iran  ] claims it needs such a hardened facility as the [ORG Qom Enrichment Facility  ] because for years both the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Israel  ] have threatened to bomb its nuclear sites . 
Is it not surprising [LOC Iran  ] would try to keep its location a secret to have an emergency back-up facility ? o [LOC Iran  ] 's own failure to meet its obligations for transparency and [ORG IAEA  ] monitoring of sensitive nuclear installations is the cause for the international community 's concerns that surrounding its nuclear program. o [LOC Iran  ] 's decision to construct yet another clandestine site only deepens these concerns . 
-- Can [LOC Iran  ] simply purchase the fuel from an international supplier , as some have advocated in [LOC Iran  ] ? o Legally , [LOC Iran  ] can purchase fuel from an international supplier if it wishes. o However , we are confident [LOC Iran  ] would not find a willing supplier given the concerns surrounding its nuclear program and its continued defiance of the international community. o Outside of the context of the [ORG IAEA  ] proposal before [LOC Iran  ] , we would oppose such a deal . 
-- How would the [MISC E3+3  ] respond if [LOC Iran  ] announced it had " no choice " but to make its own fuel for the [ORG TRR  ] ? o Under three [ORG UN Security Council  ] resolutions , [LOC Iran  ] is required to suspend all uranium enrichment- related activities . 
We have offered [LOC Iran  ] a way to secure the necessary [ORG TRR  ] fuel without further violating these obligations . 
Enrichment activities to produce its own fuel for the [ORG TRR  ] would be a violation of current [MISC UNSCRs.  ] o Further , [LOC Iran  ] is not currently able to produce the fuel . 
Reconfiguration of [MISC Iranian  ] centrifuges to produce the required enrichment level ( 19.75 percent ) would cause serious international concern and could permit [LOC Iran  ] to produce a stockpile of even greater enriched uranium than it has currently ( [LOC Iran  ] 's current enrichment level is 3.5 percent ) . 
This would increase the risk of a near-term [MISC Iranian  ] breakout from the [ORG NPT  ] and sprint to producing nuclear weapons . 
-- What about recent reports indicating the [MISC Iranian  ] enrichment program has not grown . 
What is the significance of this stagnation ? o [LOC Iran  ] has slowed or scaled back the enrichment program several times since the project became public in 2002. o There are many possible explanations for the stagnation of the [MISC Iranian  ] enrichment program , including technical issues with the centrifuges and general system maintenance. o Regardless of [LOC Iran  ] 's lack of progress in its enrichment program , it continues to enrich and stockpile [ORG LEU  ] . 
This activity in violation of three [ORG United Nations Security Council  ] resolutions calling for full suspension of its nuclear and enrichment related activities , and increases the risk of a near-term [MISC Iranian  ] breakout from the [ORG NPT  ] and sprint to producing nuclear weapons .
