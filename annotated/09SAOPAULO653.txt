Brooks  ] , State POL ; Reason: 1.4 ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Post is delighted to host Special Representative ( SR ) [PER Farah Pandith’s  ] first visit to [LOC Latin America  ] , November 22-23 . 
[LOC Brazil  ] offers a unique context for engaging the local [MISC Muslim  ] communities . 
The country hosts a significant ( 400-500 thousand ) [MISC Muslim  ] minority that lives within a larger society that has historically taken great pride in both its diversity and tradition of cultural and religious tolerance . 
[LOC Sao Paulo  ] hosts [MISC Brazil’s  ] largest [MISC Muslim  ] community , a combination of both older and more recent [MISC Arab  ] immigrants ( mostly from [LOC Lebanon  ] ) as well as some [MISC Africans  ] and [MISC Brazilian  ] converts . 
Engaging this group in the midst of [MISC Brazil’s  ] famous “melting pot” context can generate opportunities for making connections not available elsewhere and will likely echo favorably with non-Muslim [MISC Brazilians  ] . 
[MISC Brazil’s Muslims  ] By the Numbers ( Such as They Are ) <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Statistics on [MISC Brazil’s Muslim  ] population vary widely . 
A year 2000 census lists only 27,000 [MISC Muslims  ] in the country . 
Spokesmen for the country’s [MISC Muslim  ] community have sometimes put this figure as high as 1-2 million . 
Most knowledgeable observers calculate that there are 400-500 thousand [MISC Muslims  ] in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
( [MISC Muslim  ] community members universally lament the lack of hard data on their own numbers , due , in part , they say to flaws in the [MISC Brazilian  ] census methodology . 
) The majority are [MISC Sunnis  ] of [MISC Lebanese  ] descent . 
Many of these immigrants’ families arrived decades ago and have set strong roots in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
A more recent group of immigrants has complemented these earlier flows . 
The new immigrants are frequently also from [LOC Lebanon  ] , but they are poorer and far more Shiite . 
Their politics is more radical and they frequently look to [ORG Hezbollah  ] for leadership . 
The Consulate does not have contact with this latter group , which tends to keep its distance from us . 
Consulate Engagement: A Work in Progress <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) For several years , the Consulate has sought greater engagement with [ORG Sao Paulo’s  ] various [MISC Muslim  ] groups ( Refs A-E ) . 
Working closely with the [MISC Lebanese  ] Consul General , [PER Joseph Sayah  ] , we have developed an increasing network of friends among Sheiks and community leaders in the [MISC Sunni  ] community , including an ability to dialogue with some [MISC Sunni  ] Fundamentalists who hold highly critical views of the [LOC United States  ] . 
We continue to try to make inroads into women and youth groups , but this is difficult in an essentially conservative , hierarchical community where even friendly Sheiks tend to guard their flocks closely , youth often enter family businesses and , as yet , women do not play overt leadership roles . 
Your visit offers us an opportunity to increase this engagement by highlighting both [MISC Washington-based  ] programs and giving a [LOC Washington  ] push to ideas we have developed locally. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) What follows is a description of broad trends in [MISC Brazil’s Muslim  ] communities built around data points developed from our own experiences . 
This account includes data from only two trips outside [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , a gap we intend to close in the coming year as we promote [MISC Muslim  ] engagement as part of our normal political travel in our district . 
The [MISC Lebanese  ] Connection <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Heavy [MISC Lebanese  ] immigration to [LOC Brazil  ] , most of which was [MISC Maronite  ] [MISC Christian  ] , has shaped [MISC Brazil’s Muslim  ] community in important ways . 
Most of the [MISC Lebanese  ] who are here are descended from earlier generation immigrants who extol the virtues of a tolerant [LOC Lebanon  ] where [MISC Christians  ] , [MISC Jews  ] and [MISC Muslims  ] mixed with ease . 
This is a cornerstone of this community and has only been reinforced by [MISC Brazil’s  ] own broad traditions of cultural tolerance . 
Many [MISC Lebanese  ] [MISC Brazilians  ] would like to see this spirit brought back to the country of their ancestors/their country of origin . 
A key figure in this effort is Lebanon’s Sao [MISC Paulo-based  ] Consul General , [PER Joseph Sayah  ] . 
A [MISC Maronite  ] [MISC Christian  ] with fluent [MISC Arabic  ] and an intimate understanding of [LOC Islam  ] , he actively maintains contacts with a wide range of actors in the [MISC Brazil’s Islamic  ] communities , promoting moderation . 
The social events he sponsors put this tolerance on remarkable display . 
In his hands , [ORG Lebanese National Day  ] becomes a virtual celebration of religious comity , with [MISC Lebanese  ] [MISC Jews  ] , [MISC Christians  ] and [MISC Muslims  ] all hugging and conversing in fluent [MISC Arabic  ] . 
[PER Sayah  ] is a close friend of the Consulate and a key interlocutor in reaching out to disaffected [MISC Muslims  ] who would rather keep their distance from us . 
[LOC America  ] at [LOC Arms-Length:  ] the [MISC Sunnis  ] of [LOC San Bernardo  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [LOC San Bernardo  ] suburb of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] is home to a [MISC Sunni  ] mosque that is run by [PER Jihad Hammadeh  ] , a [MISC Lebanese  ] Sheik who speaks excellent [MISC Portuguese  ] . 
For this reason , he frequently appears in local media speaking out on [MISC Islamic  ] or [MISC Middle Eastern  ] issues ( often criticizing what he sees as unfair stereotyping of [MISC Muslims  ] in global media ) . 
[PER Hammadeh  ] also works for two organizations that are dedicated to the spread of [MISC Islam  ] in [LOC Latin America:  ] the Center for the Propagation of [MISC Islam  ] in [LOC Latin America  ] ( [ORG CDIAL  ] ) and the [ORG World Assembly of Muslim Youth  ] ( [ORG WAMY  ] ) . 
The latter was originally financed by the [ORG Saudi Monarchy  ] , but sources indicate that that funding has dried up in recent years . 
The [LOC San Bernardo Mosque  ] gives classes in both [MISC Islam  ] and [MISC Arabic  ] language to those interested and makes strong efforts to convert [MISC Brazilians  ] to [MISC Islam.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Hammadeh  ] meets with us , but never attends our events and keeps us at arm’s-length . 
When we have suggested visiting his [MISC Arabic  ] language classes , he has demurred . 
When during a recent visit [PER SP’s Jared Cohen  ] talked about creating cyber-linkages between [MISC Brazilian  ] Muslims and [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Muslims  ] , [PER Hammadeh  ] said that this should take place through individual Sheiks ( Ref B ) . 
[PER Hammadeh  ] is generally moderate in his public pronouncements , but various sources indicate that the [MISC Islamic  ] line he promotes among followers is strongly fundamentalist . 
Modern Islam: Sheik [PER Houssam Al-Boustani  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Sheik [PER Al-Boustani  ] teaches a class for young [MISC Brazilians  ] interested in learning [MISC Arabic  ] and learning about [MISC Islam  ] under the auspices of the [ORG Lebanese Future Movement  ] . 
[PER Boustani  ] studied [MISC Islam  ] in [LOC India  ] and has lived in [LOC Brazil  ] for nine years . 
He is an extremely enthusiastic and energetic teacher who peppers his lessons on the [MISC Koran  ] and on [MISC Arabic  ] language with self-deprecating humor . 
His students , which he says number seventy-five at any one time , are generally young [MISC Brazilian  ] professionals who are attracted to what [PER Boustani  ] calls his version of “modern” [MISC Islam  ] . 
[PER Boustani  ] is most welcoming to us and has had [PER Poloff  ] as a guest in his classes . 
He has also worked on a number of inter-faith initiatives , including the [ORG Abraham Path Project  ] , consulting for a [MISC Brazilian  ] TV movie ( a fictional romance ) about a [MISC Jewish  ] Holocaust survivor and an [MISC Arab  ] woman who marry in [LOC Brazil  ] after [ORG World War II  ] , and co-teaching a course on religion with a Rabbi and a Catholic Priest . 
Finally , he has recently published a book about [PER Mohammed  ] in [MISC Portuguese  ] and is working on a book on [MISC Islam  ] in [LOC Brazil.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Boustani’s openness is sincere , but did not necessarily come naturally to him . 
According to [LOC Lebanon  ] CG [PER Joseph Sayah  ] , it is the product of a long process . 
[PER Boustani  ] has a tough-hewn past . 
He is a former amateur boxer , and he fought the [MISC Soviets  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
When he arrived here nine years ago , according to [LOC Lebanon  ] CG [PER Joseph Sayah  ] , he was quite extreme in his views . 
Over time , he has moderated considerably . 
His teaching style , as witnessed by Conoff , is expertly pitched for young [MISC Brazilians  ] attracted to [MISC Islam  ] but who also dress stylishly and require/respond to a highly entertaining presentation of religious ideas . 
[PER Boustani  ] himself has said that [MISC Islamic  ] outreach in [LOC Brazil  ] has to engage other religious traditions . 
He also admires some aspects of Brazil’s Evangelical [MISC Christian  ] communities , which he says have become experts at reaching humble folk with a mass message . 
( Note: [PER Boustani  ] is presently in [LOC Lebanon  ] , but we are attempting to arrange a meeting with his students . 
End Note . 
) [ORG Anti-American Attitudes  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While [MISC Brazil’s Islamic  ] community is peaceful and has many friendly elements , it also contains reservoirs of strong suspicion of the [LOC U.S.  ] In an August meeting , [PER Sheik Yamani  ] of the [MISC Mosque  ] in [LOC Londrina  ] ( an interior city in [LOC Parana State  ] ) told [PER Poloff  ] that [PER Bin Laden’s  ] involvement in the 9-11 attacks on the [MISC Twin Towers  ] had never been proven . 
( When [PER Poloff  ] pointed out that [PER Bin Laden  ] had bragged about the same on television , [PER Sheik Yamani  ] replied , “Such things can be doctored.” ) The [PER Sheik  ] , a 31 year old of [MISC Portuguese  ] descent , proved otherwise quite friendly , inviting [PER Poloff  ] to attend Friday services at his [LOC Londrina Mosque  ] . 
He appeared to represent a conservative strain of [MISC Euro-Islam  ] , evidenced by his and his wife’s highly conservative dress . 
[PER Poloff  ] has also taken pains to correct other myths that abound among some [MISC Muslim  ] contacts , such as the story that former President [PER Bush  ] is the grandson of a [MISC U.S.-based  ] Pastor [PER Bush  ] , who wrote a book condemning [MISC Islam  ] in the 19th century . 
The Radicals <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) While the majority of [MISC Brazil’s Muslims  ] are moderate in orientation and the overwhelming majority is moderate in deed and action , genuine radical elements do exist here , some in the Tri-Border area of [LOC Foz de Iguacu  ] and others among Sao [PER Paulo’s  ] estimated 20,000-strong , Hezbollah-oriented Shia population . 
[MISC Muslims  ] at the moderate , [ORG Sunni-oriented Future Institute  ] charge that Shia immigrants sometimes come to [LOC Brazil  ] with [ORG Hezbollah  ] support ( allegedly USD 50,000 is a typical sum ) to found businesses to support [ORG Hezbollah  ] in [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
Reasons to Engage <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The [MISC Brazilian-Lebanese  ] context provides an excellent double background of tolerance that already promotes a high degree of mixing between [MISC Brazil’s Muslims  ] and the rest of the society . 
Engaging moderate [MISC Muslims  ] puts radicals on the defensive and opens conduits of communication that could lead to greater information about more distant elements of the community given over to greater radicalism . 
Work with friendly moderates should not be seen as separate from monitoring more threatening elements . 
While Brazil’s tiny , Hezbollah-oriented Shia population is a legitimate concern , [LOC Lebanon  ] CG [PER Joseph Sayah  ] also told [PER Poloff  ] to “not lose sight of the [MISC Sunnis.”  ] ( Note . 
Sunnis outnumber [MISC Shiites  ] in [LOC Brazil  ] by about ten to one . 
End Note . 
) [PER Sayah  ] described how some young [MISC Brazilians  ] , either of [MISC Arab  ] background or not , have become attracted to fundamentalist versions of [MISC Islam  ] . 
While beliefs do not translate directly into action , such conversions can create a climate for the growth of fanaticism . 
Al-Boustani’s version of “modern [MISC Islam”  ] is tailored to counter that . 
" By expressing a willingness to engage all groups , we make it more difficult for extremists to try to create the kind of closed atmosphere that enables their recruiting " . <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Toward this end , Post has suggested several possible programs , including a campaign to provide consular information to [MISC Muslim  ] contacts , a series of outreach presentations on President [PER Obama  ] , and , most important , our desire to bring down a visiting [LOC U.S.  ] Sheik who can explain how [MISC Islam  ] is now a vital part of [MISC American  ] society and build ties with local religious leaders . 
Given its size , diversity and traditions of cultural tolerance , [LOC Brazil  ] could be an excellent testing ground for programs that might be useful to other WHA posts with similar [MISC Muslim  ] minority populations .
