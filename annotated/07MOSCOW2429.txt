<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 [LOC MOSCOW  ] 002429 SIPDIS SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 05/23/2017 TAGS PREL , PGOV , PINR , RS SUBJECT: [MISC RUSSIAN  ] REACTION TO [PER LITVINENKO  ] MURDER CHARGES REF: [LOC LONDON  ] 1997 Classified By: Ambassador [PER William J. Burns  ] . 
Reasons 1.4 ( b and d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: The [ORG GOR  ] is highly unlikely to extradite former [MISC FSB  ] officer [PER Andrey Lugovoy  ] to [LOC Britain  ] , citing constitutional and other legal prohibitions against the extradition of [MISC Russian  ] citizens . 
Official and unofficial [MISC Russian  ] reaction to the May 22 [MISC British  ] announcement that [PER Lugovoy  ] would be charged with the murder of [PER Aleksandr Litvinenko  ] has been nearly uniform in rejecting the [LOC UK  ] request that he stand trial in [LOC London  ] . 
The [ORG MFA  ] held out the prospect of further cooperation in the investigation , while citing the impossibility of extradition , but other [MISC Russian  ] commentators were more categorical , suggesting that the [MISC British  ] charges were politically motivated . 
A few opposition voices called for [PER Lugovoy  ] to voluntarily submit to [MISC British  ] justice . 
The [MISC British  ] Embassy expects a further worsening in the [LOC UK-Russia  ] and [LOC EU-Russia  ] relationships . 
We should continue to reinforce to the [ORG GOR  ] the damaging consequences to [MISC Russia’s  ] reputation should this case fail to reach trial . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On May 22 , the [ORG UK’s Crown Prosecution Service  ] announced that it had sufficient evidence to request Lugovoy’s extradition and to charge him with the polonium poisoning of [PER Litvinenko  ] in November 2006 . 
[LOC UK  ] Ambassador [PER Brenton  ] told the Ambassador May 23 that the [LOC UK  ] Embassy expected to receive the final warrant by the end of the week and would transmit it to the Procuracy shortly thereafter . 
EXTRADITION: OBSTACLES AND OPTIONS ---------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Both the [MISC Russian  ] [ORG Constitution  ] and the [ORG Criminal Code  ] prohibit the [ORG GOR  ] from extraditing [MISC Russian  ] citizens , as is the case in several other [MISC European  ] countries whose legal systems have evolved from the [MISC Napoleonic  ] code . 
[LOC Russia  ] has a 2006 Memorandum of Understanding with the [ORG Crown Prosecution Service  ] and is a signatory to the 1957 [ORG European Convention  ] on Extradition . 
Both of these were mentioned in the [ORG Prosecution Service’s  ] announcement of the charges , but neither of them would supercede the [MISC Russian  ] [ORG Constitution  ] and obligate [LOC Russia  ] to extradite [PER Lugovoy  ] . 
There is a precedent for the [ORG GOR  ] to prosecute [MISC Russian  ] citizens in lieu of extradition . 
Three times it has done so at [LOC U.S.  ] request -- two murders and one money laundering case -- but none of these cases led to a conviction , and the [MISC British  ] are not apparently considering this option. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In a May 22 statement on its website , the [ORG MFA  ] reiterated its readiness to cooperate further in an objective investigation into Litvinenko’s death , but it emphasized that [MISC Russia’s  ] legal prohibitions against extradition were well known and similar to those in place in other countries. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Other official and unofficial [MISC Russian  ] reaction was overwhelmingly against the [MISC British  ] request . 
[ORG Duma  ] Speaker [PER Boris Gryzlov  ] said that the [MISC Russian  ] parliament would uphold [MISC Russian  ] law and not allow [PER Lugovoy  ] to be returned to [LOC Britain  ] . 
[ORG International Affairs Committee  ] Chairman [PER Konstantin Kosachev  ] warned that diplomatic relations with the [LOC UK  ] would be negatively affected should the charges be politically motivated . 
[ORG Duma  ] Deputy [PER Viktor Ilyukhin  ] , the vice chair of the [ORG Duma’s Security Committee  ] , rhetorically asked why [LOC Russia  ] should even consider Britain’s request when it ignored the GOR’s efforts to extradite [PER Boris Berezovskiy  ] and [MISC Chechen  ] separatist emissary [PER Akhmed Zakayev  ] . 
LDPR Chairman [PER Vladimir Zhironovskiy  ] thought that [MISC Russian  ] law enforcement might want to trade [PER Lugovoy  ] for [MISC Berezovskiy.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Independent [ORG Duma  ] Deputy [PER Vladimir Ryzhkov  ] was one of the few who suggested [MISC Russia’s  ] international interests ought to take precedence over national law and expressed confidence in the results of the [MISC British  ] investigation . 
Protecting [PER Lugovoy  ] would lead to extensive damage to [MISC Russia’s  ] image abroad , he said . 
Likewise , LDPR Deputy [PER Aleksey Mitrofonov  ] publicly called on [PER Lugovoy  ] to return to [LOC London  ] voluntarily . 
[PER Mitrofonov  ] said that [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC Britain  ] needed to resolve the issue or [LOC Russia  ] faced the prospect of further deterioration in its relations with the [LOC West  ] amid growing suspicions that the [ORG GOR  ] was protecting [PER Lugovoy  ] . 
He suggested that “public” pressure on [PER Lugovoy  ] to voluntarily face [MISC British  ] justice might be the best way out of an impasse . 
BRITAIN’S NEXT STEPS -------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Noting that the [LOC UK  ] would be seeking an [ORG EU  ] statement of support in urging [LOC Russia  ] to agree to extradition ( reftel ) , [PER Brenton  ] predicted that the failure to turn over [ORG Lugovoy  ] would create serious problems in London’s bilateral relationship [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00002429 002 OF 002 with [LOC Moscow  ] , and potentially problems in the [MISC EU-Russian  ] relationship as well . 
Failing any progress , he reiterated the [LOC UK  ] may reassess whether it would support a new [ORG EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement  ] . 
The [MISC German  ] and [MISC French  ] missions have expressed to us their doubts about this approach , noting the similar constitutional restrictions on the extradition of nationals by some [ORG EU  ] countries . 
PUBLIC APATHY ABOVE ALL ----------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Ekho Moskvy’s  ] [PER Aleksey Venediktov  ] told us separately there is little chance of a resolution soon , particularly given the rift in relations between [PER Putin  ] and [PER Blair  ] . 
[PER Putin  ] believes PM [PER Blair  ] betrayed him over the [MISC British  ] refusal to extradite [PER Berezovskiy  ] , and [PER Venediktov  ] said that the [ORG GOR  ] has now pinned its hopes for a better relationship with [LOC Britain  ] on Brown . 
[PER Venediktov  ] said [MISC Russian  ] public opinion is largely indifferent to the whole affair , based on responses to Ekho’s on-air discussions about Litvinenko’s death , and doubted it would be a factor in the [ORG GOR  ] position . 
[ORG Demos Center’s  ] [PER Tanya Lokshina  ] similarly questioned whether there would be anything other than public support for the GOR’s position and that the public was more likely to believe that the charge against [PER Lugovoy  ] was one more [MISC Western  ] provocation. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Comment . 
It is highly unlikely that the [ORG GOR  ] will yield its constitutional principle on extradtion . 
There is no indication that any [MISC Russian  ] offer of cooperation short of extradition will satisfy the [ORG Crown Prosecution Service’s  ] request . 
Given the sensational nature of the murder and the uncertainty over where the trial may lead beyond [PER Lugovoy  ] , there has been little official interest expressed in [PER Lugovoy  ] clearing his name in a [LOC UK  ] court . 
Although we know of no other legal mechanisms that would trump the [MISC Russian  ] constitution , we should continue to reinforce to the [ORG GOR  ] the long-term damage to [MISC Russia’s  ] reputation if this case fails to go to trial .
