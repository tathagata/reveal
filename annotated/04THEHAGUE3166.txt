[PER SOBEL  ] FOR REASONS 1 .4 ( B AND D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: During a one and one half hour discussion with Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] on December 2 , [MISC Dutch  ] Foreign Minister [PER Bernard Bot  ] laid out his priorities for the last few weeks of the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG EU  ] presidency . 
[PER Bot  ] stated categorically that he will not lift the [MISC Chinese  ] Arms Embargo , but predicted ( again ) that [LOC Luxembourg  ] would . 
He claimed that getting a yes on [LOC Turkey  ] will be the most important legacy of the [MISC Dutch  ] presidency , but stressed that this will not happen unless [LOC Turkey  ] signs the [ORG Ankara Customs Union Agreement  ] protocol on [LOC Cyprus  ] at the eleventh hour on December 17 . 
He faulted the [ORG Commission  ] for the lack of progress on [MISC Romanian  ] and [MISC Croatian  ] accession talks . 
With regard to [LOC Russia  ] , [PER Bot  ] said [PER Putin  ] 's debating skills during the [MISC U.S.-EU  ] summit were impressive but worried that [MISC Russian  ] great game thinking will continue to thwart closer [MISC U.S.-EU  ] cooperation in [LOC Ukraine  ] and other parts of the new neighborhood . 
The [ORG EU  ] will remain engaged in [LOC Ukraine  ] despite [MISC Russian  ] pressure , but [PER Bot  ] expected a new election would likely produce the same ( fraudulent ) results . 
[PER Bot  ] is proud that he was able to bring [MISC Israelis  ] and [MISC Palestinians  ] together at the [ORG EUROMED  ] conference and intends to stay engaged in the [LOC Middle East  ] after the conclusion of the [MISC Dutch  ] Presidency . 
Finally , [PER Bot  ] described the [MISC EU-Iran  ] agreement as flawed , but better than nothing: half and egg is better than a shell . 
END SUMMARY . 
[LOC CHINA  ] ARMS EMBARGO: I WILL NOT LIFT -------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Bot  ] stated that the [MISC Chinese  ] have stepped up the pressure to have the embargo lifted before the end of the year . 
He said he recently told [MISC Chinese  ] Foreign Minister [PER Li  ] on the phone that I will not lift the embargo . 
( Note: This is the first time [PER Bot  ] has stated this categorically . 
) Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] asked about the language on a positive signal we understood would be included in the [LOC EU-China  ] summit statement on December 8 ; [PER Bot  ] acknowledged that the statement would include language indicating that the [ORG EU  ] was working toward lifting the embargo but would not go further . 
[PER Bot  ] denied that the statement would include any conditions on lifting , but stressed that the [ORG EU  ] would appeal for action on [ORG Human Rights  ] and make clear that the toolbox and strengthened code of conduct must be in place before lift . 
( Grinning , [PER Bot  ] said he told [PER Li  ] to blame the [MISC French  ] if their refusal to make concessions on the toolbox prevented the lifting of the embargo . 
) According to [PER Bot  ] , [PER Li  ] said that the [MISC Chinese  ] would ratify the [ORG International Convention  ] on [ORG Civil and Political Rights  ] soon , but did not want to do it with a gun to their heads. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Asked about the current dynamic within the [ORG EU  ] , [PER Bot  ] said that the [MISC Baltics  ] had recently become more active in expressing their concerns about lifting the embargo at this time , along with the [MISC Danes  ] , [MISC Swedes  ] , and [MISC Czechs  ] . 
[PER Bot  ] predicted , however , that the embargo would almost certainly be lifted during the [LOC Luxembourg  ] presidency , probably in May or June 2005 , in response to pressure from [LOC China  ] and [LOC France  ] . 
TURKEY: I WANT A YES ---------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Bot  ] told Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] that he is determined to get a yes for [LOC Turkey  ] at the December 17 Council meeting , asserting that this is the most important thing he hopes to accomplish this year . 
He stated categorically that the Council decision will use the October 6 [ORG Commission  ] report language on open-ended negotiations: the [MISC Austrians  ] , he said , will not get what they want . 
On the other hand , [PER Bot  ] argued that [LOC Turkey  ] must eventually agree to sign the protocol to the [ORG Ankara Agreement  ] ( effectively recognizing [LOC Cyprus  ] ) -- which he expected them to do at the absolutely last minute on December 17 or early December 18 ( after midnight ) -- or there is no deal . 
[PER Bot  ] passed this message to [MISC Turkish  ] FM Gul several times over the past few weeks , he said , but Gul so far remained adamant that [LOC Turkey  ] would not sign . 
Shrugging , [PER Bot  ] said that if that remained the [MISC Turkish  ] position there was nothing he could do as this was non-negotiable ; if [LOC Turkey  ] did sign , he added , then [LOC Cyprus  ] would come under enormous pressure to drop all other additional demands. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Bot  ] asked for [LOC U.S.  ] assistance in convincing [LOC Turkey  ] to suspend military operations in the [LOC Aegean  ] , at least through December 17 , as they were providing a pretext for [LOC Greece  ] to agitate against [MISC Turkish  ] accession . 
According to [PER Bot  ] , [MISC Turkish  ] PM [MISC Erdogan  ] had told him recently that he could not stop the flights because he did not control the military -- an assertion [PER Bot  ] found disturbing . 
Asked by Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] about a possible date for starting negotiations with [LOC Turkey  ] , [PER Bot  ] said that it would almost certainly be late 2005 ; he noted that in public statements he sometimes added or early 2006 as a sop to the [MISC French  ] , but did not believe it . 
ROMANIA/CROATIA: BAD VIBES --------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Bot  ] expressed frustration with the slow progress on [LOC Romania  ] and Croation accession . 
[LOC Romania  ] was not even close to accession , he said , largely because of its lack of progress on competition area ; while [LOC Croatia  ] 's failure to hand over [PER Gotovina  ] to the [ORG ICTY  ] was a serious problem . 
[PER Bot  ] said that he did not want the [MISC Dutch  ] presidency to be remembered primarily for saying no to multiple candidates , and was talking intensively with the [ORG Commission  ] to find a way to move forward . 
RUSSIA/UKRAINE: [PER PUTIN  ] WINS ON POINTS ------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) In response to a question from Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] , [PER Bot  ] denied that the lunch discussion on [LOC Ukraine  ] during the recent [MISC EU-Russia  ] summit had been as contentious as reported by some . 
[PER Bot  ] stressed that [PER Putin  ] had been polite but tough and very well prepared . 
Compared to his own Prime Minister , [PER Bot  ] continued , [PER Putin  ] came across as a strong debater who could win on points but still fail to convince his audience because his premises were all wrong . 
[PER Putin  ] had argued , for example , that the [ORG EU  ] should stay out of [LOC Ukraine  ] just as [LOC Russia  ] has , and suggested that [LOC Ukraine  ] 's ties to [LOC Russia  ] meant it would never be a [MISC Western European  ] state . 
With regard to next steps , [PER Bot  ] said that he had deliberately chosen to let [PER Solana  ] take the lead for the [ORG EU  ] ( despite pressure from the [MISC Poles  ] to take a more active personal role ) since the [ORG Commission  ] was inherently less threatening to [LOC Russia  ] than the [ORG EU  ] presidency . 
[PER Bot  ] expected that the [MISC Ukrainian  ] supreme court decision would lay the basis for either a re-run of the election or completely new elections , and speculated that the [MISC Russian  ] line in the sand would be for the [ORG EU  ] to recognize [PER Yuschenko  ] as a winner without one of these steps occurring first . 
In either case , however , [PER Bot  ] concluded glumly that the same forces that rigged the last election would probably do so again unless the [LOC West  ] could come up with 25,000 monitors . 
While the [ORG EU  ] had been relatively united so far , [PER Bot  ] doubted that consensus could be maintained over the long term if the cause appeared lost. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) With regard to the four common spaces , both sides agreed at the summit to set May 2005 as the target for concluding agreement , but [PER Bot  ] was skeptical that this would be achieved , especially with regard to external relations . 
[LOC Russia  ] , he said , is still operating on the basis of 19th century [LOC Great Game  ] thinking , while the [ORG EU  ] is trying to be a good neighbor . 
[ORG MIDDLE EAST:  ] STAYING IN THE PICTURE ------------------------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Bot  ] confirmed that the [LOC Shaath-Shalom-Bot  ] meeting on the margins of the November 29 [MISC EUROMED  ] meetings had been very constructive . 
[PER Bot  ] had told both parties that the [ORG EU  ] would refrain from discussing final status issues provided they made a real commitment to successful [MISC Palestinian  ] elections and related near-term steps . 
( In response to a question from the Ambassador , [PER Bot  ] said that he had restrained [PER Solana  ] and some [MISC Arab  ] delegations from seeking to restart a discussion on final status issues during the dinner by spelling out this agreement . 
) The mood of that meeting had helped set a positive tone for the dinner , which [PER Bot  ] contrasted favorably to the previous EUROMED dinner in which soup and plates flew . 
The [ORG EU  ] is committed to providing funds , logistical support , and observers for the [MISC Palestinian  ] elections but is also seeking support from countries in the region. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Bot  ] was eager to coordinate [ORG EU  ] efforts with the [LOC U.S.  ] and expressed frustration that more information on [LOC U.S.  ] near-term planning was not available . 
He did not think he would be able to attend the December 11 [ORG Forum for the Future  ] meeting in [LOC Rabat  ] because he would be attending [PER Prince Bernhard  ] 's funeral , but stressed that he intended to remain engaged on the [LOC Middle East  ] even after the end of the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG EU  ] presidency . 
( Note: On December 3 , [PER Bot  ] told the Ambassador he would like to attend the [ORG Forum for the Future  ] and intended to ask the Prime Minister if he could be excused from the funeral , but stressed that the Prime Minister was unlikely to approve . 
) Both the [MISC Palestinians  ] and [MISC Israelis  ] , he said , appreciated the [MISC Netherlands'  ] balanced approach ( especially when compared to some other [MISC European  ] governments ) and had asked him to stay involved . 
[PER Bot  ] said he had discussed this with his [LOC Luxembourg  ] counterpart who also supported leaving much of this portfolio in [MISC Dutch  ] hands. describing his commitment to IRAN: HALF AN EGG BETTER THAN A SHELL -------------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] asked [PER Bot  ] if he thought the [MISC EU-3  ] agreement with [LOC Iran  ] would hold ; [PER Bot  ] replied in the affirmative . 
He readily acknowledged that the agreement was not perfect , but noted that [LOC China  ] had made clear its intention to veto any critical resolution in the [ORG Security Council  ] , so that route was not practical . 
Citing a [MISC Dutch  ] proverb , [PER Bot  ] argued that half an egg is better than a whole shell . 
The agreement would at least slow down the [MISC Iranians  ] , he said , and could lead to a more significant [ORG IAEA  ] monitoring regime in the future . 
COMMENT: ------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Bot  ] was confident and decisive throughout the meeting . 
Although still looking for consensus within the [ORG EU  ] , he also appeared comfortable choosing -- when forced to make a choice -- a position in favor of the transatlantic agenda over the objections of [ORG EU  ] partners , as in the case of [LOC China  ] . 
His irritation with [LOC France  ] was palpable ; at one point , [PER Bot  ] told the Ambassador in confidence that it would be a big mistake to reward [ORG Chirac  ] 's behavior with a presidential visit or other post-election gesture without guaranteed deliverables .
