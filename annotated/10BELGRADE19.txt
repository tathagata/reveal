End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) After presenting her credentials on January 28 , the Ambassador had a 45 minute working meeting with President [PER Boris Tadic  ] . 
[PER Tadic  ] was accompanied by his foreign policy advisor [PER Jovan Ratkovic  ] and MFA State Secretary [PER Mirko Stefanovic  ] . 
Bilateral --------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The Ambassador told [PER Tadic  ] that she was eager to work with him to build on the strong foundation created by her predecessors , noting that Vice President [PER Biden  ] 's May 2009 visit to [LOC Belgrade  ] had opened a new chapter in our bilateral relations . 
She said that the military-to-military relationship was strong , but it was time to take it to the next level through increased joint training and exchanges , [MISC Serbian  ] contributions to peacekeeping missions , and participation in [ORG NATO Partnership for Peace  ] ( [ORG PfP  ] ) activities . 
The Ambassador also told [PER Tadic  ] that she would focus on expanding economic and business ties , including new investments , and supporting the completion of [LOC Serbia  ] 's [ORG WTO  ] accession . 
She also emphasized her commitment to seek opportunities for additional high-level contacts between our governments . 
She noted President [PER Tadic  ] 's visit to [ORG UNGA  ] last fall , the recent visits of Defense Minister [PER Sutanovac  ] and Foreign Minister [PER Jeremic  ] to [LOC Washington  ] , and Interior Minister [PER Dacic  ] 's meetings this week . 
The Ambassador pointed to two upcoming congressional delegations to [LOC Serbia  ] and the February 10 groundbreaking for the [ORG New Embassy Compound  ] ( [ORG NEC  ] ) in [LOC Belgrade  ] as early opportunities to continue our engagement and further highlight the relationship publicly. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Tadic  ] said he was pleasantly surprised to hear about the scheduled groundbreaking event , as he had worked with four different [LOC U.S.  ] ambassadors going back to his tenure as Minister of Defense to identify a suitable location for the new [ORG U.S. Embassy BELGRADE  ] 00000019 002 OF 005 and facilitate the sale . 
He commented that he was encouraged to see countries such as the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC China  ] investing in modern diplomatic facilities in [LOC Belgrade  ] . 
He also stated that it was time for the [MISC Serbian  ] government to reconstruct its own buildings damaged during the 1999 [ORG NATO  ] intervention. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Shifting topics abruptly , [PER Tadic  ] voiced a complaint that despite all the talk of expanding the bilateral relations and the strong ties between [LOC Serbia  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] , he himself had not visited [LOC Washington  ] in over four years . 
( Note: To our knowledge this is the first time that [PER Tadic  ] has expressed an interest in doing so in several years . 
) He commented that concrete results of high-level engagement were lacking , and cautioned that [LOC U.S.  ] policy toward the [LOC Balkans  ] , in particular on [LOC Kosovo  ] , had implications for democracy in [LOC Serbia  ] . 
Recalling his own early involvement in the democracy movement and the month he had spent in jail for his activism , [PER Tadic  ] said that his government was committed to continued democratic reform ; it had to contend with a significant nationalist opposition , however . 
The Ambassador reiterated the [ORG USG  ] 's commitment , following on the Vice President 's May 2009 visit , to sustained bilateral engagement with [LOC Serbia  ] on all issues , including those areas where we do not agree . 
She offered to continue to explore possibilities for high-level visits on both sides to keep our bilateral channels open . 
[ORG European Integration  ] and [ORG ICTY Cooperation  ] ----------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The Ambassador recalled Vice President [PER Biden  ] 's expression of support for [LOC Serbia  ] 's [MISC European  ] aspirations and congratulated [PER Tadic  ] on his government 's recent achievements with the [ORG EU  ] , including visa liberalization , implementation of the [ORG Interim Trade Agreement  ] , and submission of its membership application . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] saw the integration of the [MISC Western  ] [LOC Balkans  ] into the [ORG European Union  ] as a key priority and remained prepared , working with the [ORG EU  ] , to support this process . 
She underscored the importance of continued engagement with the [ORG International Criminal Tribunal  ] for the [LOC Former Yugoslavia  ] ( [ORG ICTY  ] ) and [LOC U.S.  ] readiness to support the hunt for [PER Ratko Mladic  ] and [PER Goran Hadzic.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) [PER Tadic  ] expressed appreciation for [LOC U.S.  ] help with the [ORG EU  ] accession process . 
On [ORG ICTY  ] cooperation , he explained that [LOC Serbia  ] was working intensively to capture [PER Ratko Mladic  ] " for our own reasons , " not due to pressure from the international community or the [ORG ICTY  ] , but to demonstrate its own resolve to capture war criminals . 
He emphasized [LOC Serbia  ] 's commitment to reconciliation in the region , pointing to its responsibilities as a guarantor of [LOC Dayton  ] . 
He also underscored [LOC Serbia  ] 's commitment to cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] on a range of threats , including organized crime , corruption , terrorism , and narcotics , pointing to the success of several recent joint counternarcotics operations . 
[PER Tadic  ] stated that undertaking such sensitive operations was politically risky and [LOC Serbia  ] would continue to do the right thing ; in return , however , [LOC Serbia  ] hoped for similarly strong bilateral engagement in other areas and expected support from the [LOC U.S.  ] on these efforts with other countries in the region . 
The Ambassador expressed [LOC U.S.  ] appreciation for [LOC Serbia  ] 's strong cooperation in these important areas and said she would be glad to discuss any areas of specific concern . 
[ORG Regional Cooperation  ] -------------------- [ORG BELGRADE  ] 00000019 003 OF 005 <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The Ambassador noted the important role that [LOC Serbia  ] can and needs to play on regional relations and stability , particularly with regard to [LOC Bosnia-Herzegovina  ] and [LOC Croatia  ] . 
She conveyed appreciation for the [MISC Serbian  ] government 's constructive support of the [LOC Butmir  ] process and urged [PER Tadic  ] to remain engaged with the parties , including RS leader [PER Milorad Dodik  ] , in particular . 
She expressed [ORG USG  ] concern about the prospect of any referendum moving forward in the [LOC Republika Srpska  ] . 
[PER Tadic  ] said that [LOC Serbia  ] believed the preservation of [LOC BiH  ] 's territorial integrity was paramount ; as a guarantor of the [LOC Dayton  ] Accords , [LOC Serbia  ] sought a peaceful solution on constitutional reform that would be consistent with [LOC Dayton  ] principles and preserve the model of two entities , three constituent peoples . 
[PER Tadic  ] noted that he was seeking a parliamentary resolution on [LOC Srebrenica  ] to recognize the gravity of the crimes committed there. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) With regard to [LOC Croatia  ] , [PER Tadic  ] said that he had known President-elect [PER Ivo Josipovic  ] for a long time and wanted to work with him to address the many different open issues such as the " huge problem " of refugees and property rights . 
He said he expected the [LOC U.S.  ] to support [MISC Serbian  ] efforts to improve that relationship and address the outstanding issues . 
[PER Tadic  ] told the Ambassador that he would soon visit [LOC Albania  ] and commented on the enormous organized crime problem facing [LOC Montenegro  ] , where he also requested [LOC U.S.  ] support . 
He emphasized that [LOC Serbia  ] supported the independence and territorial integrity of its neighbors in the region , but many issues needed to be addressed. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Turning to [LOC Kosovo  ] , [PER Tadic  ] told the Ambassador " I must be as clear as possible with you - [LOC Serbia  ] will not change its views on its territorial integrity . 
I want to be direct with you , as I have with your other colleagues . 
After the [ORG International Court of Justice  ] ( [ORG ICJ  ] ) issues its advisory opinion , we want to pursue dialogue and find a way to address the issues related to [LOC Kosovo  ] , as the current situation is untenable . 
" The Ambassador responded that despite our clear differences , the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Serbia  ] needed to keep the channels of communication on [LOC Kosovo  ] open . 
While the Vice President had conveyed our agreement to disagree on [LOC Kosovo  ] , it was important for [LOC Serbia  ] to focus on practical ways to improve the lives of [MISC Serbs  ] in [LOC Kosovo  ] and on resolving outstanding issues . 
She emphasized the need for [LOC Serbia  ] to take a responsible and forward looking approach after the [ORG ICJ  ] opinion , consistent with President [PER Tadic  ] 's own forward looking approach toward [MISC European  ] integration , that would not do harm to stability in the region nor to the other important work on our bilateral agenda . 
She recommended both sides begin a dialogue now about how to manage the way forward and said she hoped to continue discussions with [PER Tadic  ] 's foreign policy advisor , [PER Jovan Ratkovic  ] , on this subject as early as next week . 
Comment ------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S ) Comment: President [PER Tadic  ] made clear during the meeting and in his public statement that he does not intend to back down on [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
At the same time , he demonstrated that he is open to dialogue and told us what he wants: a warm reception in [LOC Washington  ] and continued high level engagement across the [LOC U.S.  ] interagency , cooperation on sensitive security issues , public support for [LOC Serbia  ] 's efforts to improve regional relations , and sensitivity to the domestic political constraints he faces on [LOC Kosovo  ] policy . 
Now is the opportune moment to lay out for [PER Tadic  ] and his key foreign policy advisors what we expect of him , namely a constructive and coordinated response to the [ORG ICJ  ] 's upcoming advisory opinion accompanied by increased pragmatism in establishing a modus vivendi [ORG BELGRADE  ] 00000019 004 OF 005 with [LOC Kosovo  ] , and continued forceful engagement with [PER Milorad Dodik  ] to preserve stability in [LOC BiH  ] . 
In the coming months , high-level [LOC Washington  ] engagement with [PER Tadic  ] will be essential to drive these messages home . 
The other sine qua non is a strong , consistent message from the [ORG European Union  ] that continued antagonism and inflexibility on [LOC Kosovo  ] after the [ORG ICJ  ] opinion will hamper [LOC Serbia  ] 's progress toward membership . 
End Comment. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( U ) Text of President [PER Tadic  ] 's remarks ( translation provided by the Presidency ) : ADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY MR. [PER BORIS TADIC  ] , PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF [LOC SERBIA  ] , ON THE OCCASSION OF THE PRESENT A TION OF THE LETTERS OF CREDENCE BY HER EXCELLENCY MRS. [PER MARY WARLICK  ] , AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND PLENIPOTENTIARY OF THE [LOC UNITED STATES  ] OF [LOC AMERICA  ] TO THE REPUBLIC OF [LOC SERBIA  ] [ORG Belgrade  ] , 28 January 2010 Excellency , It is my great pleasure to receive the Letters by which the Honorable [PER Barack Obama  ] , President of the [LOC United States  ] of [LOC America  ] is accrediting you as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the [LOC Republic  ] of [LOC Serbia  ] . 
May I ask you , Excellency , to convey to President [PER Obama  ] my cordial greetings and the assurances of my highest consideration . 
The relationship with the [LOC United States  ] of [LOC America  ] is one of the pillars of the foreign policy of the [LOC Republic  ] of [LOC Serbia  ] . 
Ever since the times when the interests of our country in the [LOC United States  ] of [LOC America  ] were represented by the diplomat and the well-known scientist of [MISC Serbian  ] origin [PER Mihailo Pupin  ] , the bilateral relations between our two countries have been characterized by friendship and alliance at all turning points in the world 's history of the twentieth century . 
Such relations and all-round cooperation were damaged at the time of the regime of [PER Slobodan Milosevic  ] . 
Following the democratic changed in [LOC Serbia  ] , we have restored our close cooperation which entered a new quality phase after the visit of [PER Vice-President Biden  ] . 
Today , [LOC Serbia  ] is a truly democratic country . 
In the past ten years of the democratic transition we have successfully implemented many reforms guaranteeing the respect of human rights , minority rights , media freedoms and free elections . 
We are very grateful for the assistance by the [LOC United States  ] of [LOC America  ] in this democratization process in [LOC Serbia  ] . 
We are particularly satisfied with the successful cooperation that we established with the [LOC United States  ] of [LOC America  ] in combating international terrorism and organized crime . 
[LOC BELGRADE  ] 00000019 005 OF 005 Excellency , Large [MISC Serbian  ] community in [LOC America  ] has for centuries provided a link between our two countries and contributed to the creation of [MISC American  ] society . 
[LOC Serbia  ] is a sister state with the [ORG State of Illinois  ] and the main partner of the [ORG Army of Serbia  ] is the [ORG National Guard of Ohio  ] . 
We are particularly pleased with the fact that [MISC American  ] companies are among the biggest foreign investors in [LOC Serbia  ] . 
Madam Ambassador , Becoming a full member of the [ORG European Union  ] is the strategic goal of the [LOC Republic  ] of [LOC Serbia  ] . 
We are convinced that the [ORG European Union  ] will not be complete until [LOC Serbia  ] and other [LOC Western Balkan  ] countries are integrated into it . 
The support of the [LOC United States  ] of [LOC America  ] in that regard is of exceptional importance . 
Madam Ambassador , [LOC Serbia  ] will continue to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity in [LOC Kosovo  ] by political and diplomatic means . 
We would like 2010 to be the year of peaceful , compromise and realistic solution of this issue , after the [ORG International Court of Justice  ] renders its advisory opinion . 
Despite different positions that we have regarding the status of [LOC Kosovo  ] , we hope that [MISC American  ] policy will respect legitimate [MISC Serbian  ] interests and that it will not jeopardize democracy in [LOC Serbia  ] . 
At the same time , [LOC Serbia  ] is very much concerned about the plans of [LOC Pristina  ] to forcefully establish its rule over the majority-Serb northern [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
If this strategy were to be implemented it would have unforeseen consequences for the stability of the region . 
Excellency , [LOC Serbia  ] is strongly committed to strengthening the regional cooperation and good-neighbourly relations . 
Without a stable , democratic [LOC Serbia  ] it is not possible to imagine the stable and prosperous [MISC Western  ] Balkans . 
[LOC Serbia  ] respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of [LOC Bosnia  ] and [LOC Herzegovina  ] , its internal arrangements defined by the [ORG Dayton Accords  ] as well as the [MISC European  ] and [MISC Euro-Atlantic  ] integration of [LOC Bosnia  ] and [LOC Herzegovina  ] . 
Excellency , You begin your mission at the very important time for the [LOC Republic  ] of [LOC Serbia  ] but also for the further development of the relations between our two countries . 
I wish you every success in the discharge of your responsible duties. l am convinced that with your knowledge and experience you will make an important contribution to the development of the overall cooperation between our two countries .
