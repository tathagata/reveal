( SBU ) On March 26 , Post received a diplomatic note from the [ORG MFA  ] outlining [LOC Libya  ] 's position on peacekeeping forces in [LOC Somalia  ] . 
This note responded to an earlier [LOC US  ] demarche on the subject ( see reftel ) . 
In a meeting with the Ambassador today , [ORG MFA  ] Secretary for the [ORG Americas Ahmed Fituri  ] said that [LOC Libya  ] 's position on the issue of support for [ORG AMISOM  ] had been cemented during a recent phone conversation between [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi and [ORG Sheikh Sherif Ahmed  ] , during which [ORG Sheikh Ahmed  ] had plead for donor funding to be directed to him , rather than to [ORG AMISOM  ] . 
The Leader reportedly agreed with this position . 
The Ambassador will seek further clarity at a scheduled meeting with the head of the [ORG MFA  ] department handling [MISC Somali  ] affairs early next week . 
In the meantime , Post would appreciate any additional relevant guidance on the matter that could be used in that meeting or in a written response to the dipnote below .

( U ) Text of the diplomatic note: The General People 's [ORG Committee  ] for [ORG Foreign Liaison  ] and [ORG International Cooperation  ] ( [ORG Americas Desk  ] ) , sends its compliments to the [ORG US Embassy  ] in the [LOC Great Jamahiriya  ] . 
In response to the esteemed [ORG Embassy  ] 's diplomatic note # 09/290 dated March 3 , 2009 regarding providing [ORG AMISOM  ] with $67 million in support , and whereas the [LOC Great Jamahiriya  ] thinks that the election of [ORG Sheikh Sharif Ahmed  ] is the beginning of political stability in [LOC Somalia  ] , we thus believe that the said support should rather go to the [MISC Somali  ] forces ( [ORG Army  ] and police ) which consist of more than 70,000 troops , and we deem it wrong to continue supporting [ORG AMISOM  ] . 
Meanwhile we do express our gratitude to the USG for the support it wishes to provide at the amount of $67 million . 
We think that the support should go to the [MISC Somali  ] forces , and therefore we welcome the opportunity to discuss the issue among the [ORG African Union  ] , the [LOC US  ] government , and [LOC Somalia  ] before providing any support or aid whether from our side or from yours . 
The General People 's [ORG Committee Secretariat for Foreign Liaison  ] and [ORG International Cooperation  ] ( [ORG Americas Desk  ] ) avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the esteemed [ORG US Embassy  ] the assurances of its highest consideration .
