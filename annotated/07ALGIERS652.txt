Ford  ] , reasons 1.4 ( b , d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) SUMMARY: In April 21-22 discussions led on the [MISC Algerian  ] side by Counselor to the President for [ORG Counterterrorism Issues  ] [PER Kamel Rezag Bara  ] , the government of [LOC Algeria  ] gave oral assurances to S/WCI Ambassador [PER Williamson  ] and an interagency delegation to establish the terms for the transfer of [MISC Algerian  ] detainees from the [LOC U.S.  ] [LOC Naval Base  ] at [LOC Guantanamo  ] to [LOC Algeria  ] . 
A working group consisting of members of both delegations encapsulated these oral assurances in written minutes of the meetings , which [PER Williamson  ] and [PER Rezag Bara  ] initialed at the end of the two-day dialogue . 
The meetings and their output produced sufficient assurances to permit the repatriation of the seven [MISC Algerian  ] detainees scheduled for transfer , except with respect to ensuring that these individuals would not pose a security risk to the [LOC U.S.  ] or international community . 
The [MISC Algerian  ] delegation indicated that it took seriously its obligations , but that [MISC Algerian  ] security services balked at providing such guarantees in the written meeting minutes. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) SUMMARY ( CONT'D ) : Ambassador [PER Williamson  ] explained to [PER Rezag Bara  ] that we sought maximum effort from the security services , understanding that there could be no solid guarantees . 
Nonetheless , [PER Rezag Bara  ] said the security assurances in writing sought by the [LOC U.S.  ] on [MISC Algerian  ] responsibility for transferred detainees and potential travel restrictions after their repatriation could not be given without consulting the highest levels of the [MISC Algerian  ] government . 
In exchange for receiving additional time ( until May 31 ) to coordinate on these outstanding points , [PER Rezag Bara  ] and the [MISC Algerian  ] delegation agreed to the earliest possible transfer of detainee [PER Sofiane Haderbache  ] , who suffers from mental illness and for whom the [LOC U.S.  ] does not require security assurances . 
At the close of the bilateral discussions , both sides agreed that the remaining assurances would be worked out between the [MISC Algerian  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] delegations through Embassy Algiers . 
End Summary . 
COURTESY CALL ON FM [PER BEDJAOUI  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) S/WCI Ambassador at Large [PER J. Clint Williamson  ] and an interagency team consisting of [PER Christopher Camponovo  ] ( [ORG NSC  ] ) , [PER Jay Alan Liotta  ] ( [ORG DoD  ] ) , [PER Andrew Morrison  ] ( S/WCI ) , and [PER Vijay Padmanabhan  ] ( [ORG State L  ] ) sought assurances from the government of [LOC Algeria  ] during April 21-22 discussions that would permit the return to [LOC Algeria  ] of [MISC Algerian  ] nationals detained at [LOC Guantanamo  ] who have been approved for transfer . 
[PER Williamson  ] opened the visit with a courtesy call on FM [PER Bedjaoui  ] during which he delivered a letter from Secretary Rice seeking [PER Bedjaoui  ] 's assistance in providing the [MISC Algerian  ] government assurances necessary for the transfers . 
[PER Williamson  ] also explained the process by which the [LOC U.S.  ] made decisions on transferring detainees out of [LOC Guantanamo  ] , including the 25 [MISC Algerians  ] on the naval base. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Noting [MISC Algerian  ] reluctance to enter into an exchange of diplomatic notes offering assurances on security and humane treatment of transferred detainees , [PER Williamson  ] told [PER Bedjaoui  ] he and his team could work with their [MISC Algerian  ] counterparts to record the necessary assurances in signed minutes of their discussions . 
The end goal , stated [PER Williamson  ] , was to find an arrangement that both fulfilled the [ORG Administration  ] 's policies and satisfied the [MISC Algerian  ] government . 
[PER Bedjaoui  ] responded that the [MISC Algerian  ] team would accommodate [PER Williamson  ] and his team , adding that signed minutes were a better vehicle for conveying the necessary assurances than an exchange of diplomatic notes . 
The FM observed that the travaux preparatoires for the [ORG UN Charter  ] are as important as the [ORG Charter  ] itself . 
DISCUSSIONS WITH [MISC ALGERIAN  ] INTERAGENCY ------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [MISC Algerian  ] delegation led by presidential counterterrorism Counselor [PER Kamel Rezag Bara  ] included representatives from the [ORG Presidency  ] , [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] , [ORG National Police  ] , security services , [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] , and the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] . 
The senior [ORG MFA  ] official present was Director General for [ORG Consular Affairs  ] [PER Hassane Rabehi  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] representatives ( paragraph 3 ) also included Ambassador [PER Ford  ] and PolEc Chief . 
Ambassador [PER Williamson  ] noted that the [MISC Algerians  ] were a valued partner in counterterrorism cooperation and gave an overview of [LOC U.S.  ] policy on [LOC Guantanamo  ] detainees , explaining that the [LOC U.S  ] had determined that seven [MISC Algerian  ] detainees were eligible for transfer . 
He emphasized our need for commitments concerning humanitarian treatment for returned detainees and assurances that persons transferred do not re-engage in terrorist activity before their transfer to [LOC Algeria  ] could be effected. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Rezag Bara  ] said [LOC Algeria  ] encouraged the [LOC U.S.  ] to close the [LOC Guantanamo  ] detention facility , since its operation created image problems for the [LOC U.S.  ] among its friends around the world . 
The [ORG GOA  ] , he continued , understood the need for investigations at [LOC Guantanamo  ] on the detained individuals and supported a resolution of all [MISC Algerian  ] detainee cases . 
[PER Rezag Bara  ] said the [MISC Algerian  ] delegation understood what kinds of assurances and commitments the [LOC U.S.  ] side sought and hoped to provide them in the course of their bilateral discussions . 
The presidential counselor stressed the [MISC Algerian  ] need to ensure that any transferred detainees , unless previously arrested or charged in [LOC Algeria  ] , were returning to the country by their own choice . 
Finally , he noted that [MISC Algerian  ] law criminalized terrorist acts committed outside [LOC Algeria  ] , even if [LOC Algeria  ] was not a target of the activity . 
In this regard , the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation should expect the [MISC Algerian  ] government to pursue investigations and charges for returned detainees . 
From its own experience with terrorism , [PER Rezag Bara  ] told [PER Williamson  ] , [LOC Algeria  ] would take all measures possible to prevent re-engagement of the returned detainees in terrorist activity . 
LIMITS ON FOREIGN TRAVEL ------------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Williamson  ] responded that he saw very few differences in approach between the two sides . 
[LOC Algeria  ] 's taking steps to control detainees and keep them from returning to terrorism would be sufficient for the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Williamson  ] made clear we were not asking [LOC Algeria  ] to detain or incarcerate the returned detainees ; it was sufficient for us to receive confirmation that the transferred detainees would be treated in accordance with [MISC Algerian  ] law and international conventions . 
[ORG DoD  ] 's [PER Liotta  ] expressed appreciation for the [MISC Algerian  ] readiness to accept responsibility for what would be in all cases medium- or high-threat detainees . 
He asked if based on [MISC Algerian  ] review of the detaineesQ , case files there was the likelihood of prosecution . 
[PER Liotta  ] also inquired what measures could be taken to limit the foreign travel of returned detainees. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) To [PER Liotta  ] 's first point , the justice ministry representative responded that an investigative judge would review facts related to the cases if the detainees once they were returned . 
It would be up to the judge to determine whether charges would be filed . 
[PER Rezag Bara  ] added that as part of this judicial review process , the [LOC U.S.  ] and other third parties could submit evidence for the judge to consider . 
The national police representative , for his part , briefed that under [MISC Algerian  ] law " convicted and subversive persons " lose the right to a passport and are subject to additional surveillance . 
[PER Liotta  ] requested further precision about non-convicted persons , since most [MISC Algerian  ] detainees fell into this category . 
[PER Rezag Bara  ] clarified that the passport was lifted for all convicted persons . 
Persons who " otherwise present a threat but retain a passport " may be administratively prevented from leaving [LOC Algeria  ] regardless of their passport status , said [PER Rezag Bara  ] . 
He added that both judicial and security service reviews of the detainees' files would be undertaken following their return . 
CASE OF SOFIANE [PER HADERBACHE  ] -------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Williamson  ] noted that one of the seven detainees whom the [LOC U.S.  ] sought to transfer to [LOC Algeria  ] did not pose a security threat and no security assurances were necessary in his case . 
[PER Sofiane Haderbache  ] , said [PER Williamson  ] , had suffered a gunshot wound to the head in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
As a result , this detainee had degenerative brain damage and would require extensive medical care for the duration of his life . 
[PER Williamson  ] indicated that the [LOC U.S.  ] sought to return this detainee quickly , since we believed the mental health treatment and attention he required would be well provided in [LOC Algeria  ] , where [PER Haderbache  ] could be near family and friends and receive mental health care in his own language and culture . 
Asked how the [MISC Algerians  ] would address [PER Haderbache  ] 's mental incapacity , [PER Rezag Bara  ] retrieved the case file . 
Reading from it , [PER Rezag Bara  ] noted that [PER Haderbache  ] had one outstanding traffic violation but otherwise had no legal entanglements . 
He said the [ORG GOA  ] was fully aware of his unique medical requirements and was prepared to provide [PER Haderbache  ] a psychological and medical evaluation and treatment in an appropriate facility upon his return . 
HUMANE TREATMENT AND [ORG ICRC  ] ACCESS TO [MISC ALGERIAN  ] PRISONERS --------------------- ------------------- -------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Bara  ] had explained in his opening presentation that returned detainees would be fully protected by [MISC Algerian  ] law and [MISC Algerian  ] international human rights commitments . 
Returning to the other six detainees who posed a medium or high security threat , [PER Williamson  ] asked if third parties such as the [ORG International Committee  ] of the [ORG Red Cross  ] ( [ORG ICRC  ] ) had access to prisoners in [LOC Algeria  ] in the event that some of the returned detainees were held in penal facilities for a period of time . 
[PER Rezag Bara  ] responded that through intelligence channels the [MISC Algerian  ] government could provide the location of government facilities in which any returned detainees would be held and questioned under the oversight of an investigative judge and the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] . 
The [ORG GOA  ] , he continued , had no problem with making that information available or providing the [ORG ICRC  ] access to the detainees under existing agreements between the [ORG ICRC  ] and the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] . 
[PER Rezag Bara  ] added that [ORG ICRC  ] personnel stationed in [LOC Tunis  ] visited [MISC Algerian  ] prisons on a monthly basis to assess conditions under which prisoners were held. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In a separate meeting , [PER Williamson  ] met April 22 with [PER Mohamed Amara  ] , Director General of [ORG Juridical  ] and [ORG Judicial Affairs  ] at the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] . 
[PER Amara  ] noted as a point of pride the strong cooperation between his government and the [ORG ICRC  ] , which he explained was critical to the reform of jails and prisons in [LOC Algeria  ] . 
He elaborated that the [ORG ICRC  ] regularly visited [MISC Algerian  ] prisons . 
In response to a question from [PER Williamson  ] , [PER Amara  ] explained that the [MISC Algerians  ] began allowing [ORG ICRC  ] access to their detention facilities in the 1990s . 
The [ORG ICRC  ] currently , said [PER Amara  ] , has freedom to move within [MISC Algerian  ] prisons and have direct contact with prisoners . 
He added there are no restrictions on access or topics of conversation . 
According to [PER Amara  ] , AlgeriaQ , s goal in cooperating with the [ORG ICRC  ] is to ensure that [LOC Algeria  ] meets international standards of detention . 
DEVIL IN THE DETAILS -------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Following the discussions between the two delegations , both sides assembled teams to prepare minutes of the conversations that would satisfy the [LOC U.S.  ] need for assurances and the [MISC Algerian  ] desire not to provide such assurances through the exchange of diplomatic notes . 
The final [MISC English-language  ] version of the minutes , which appears in paragraph 13 below , was initialed April 22 by both heads of delegation along with the final [MISC French-language  ] version . 
After protracted discussions led to an impasse on the inclusion in the minutes of two security-related points vital for the [LOC U.S.  ] side , Ambassador [ORG Ford  ] proposed working through Embassy [LOC Algiers  ] to provide acceptable assurances to [LOC Washington  ] by May 31 . 
( Note: Without additional internal discussions , the [MISC Algerian  ] security services could not be persuaded to lift their objection to including language confirming GOAQ , s responsibility for transferred detainees . 
End Note . 
) [PER Rezag Bara  ] stressed the security services were uncomfortable guaranteeing that no returned detainee would later leave [MISC Algerian  ] territory or return to terrorist activity . 
[PER Williamson  ] emphasized that the [LOC U.S.  ] was looking for 100-percent effort and understood no 100-percent guarantee is possible . 
If the [MISC Algerian  ] authorities become aware that a detainee exited [LOC Algeria  ] , we merely ask to be informed , stated [PER Williamson  ] . 
The points in question which did not appear in the final minutes at [ORG GOA  ] request follow: -- The [MISC Algerian  ] government has agreed to take responsibility for these persons in conformity with its legislation and its international obligations , and will take all necessary and appropriate measures in conformity with its legislation and its international obligations to prevent the transferred persons from becoming involved in or facilitating terrorist activities . 
-- In response to an expressed request of the [ORG American Government  ] concerning the possibility of the restriction of the freedom to travel abroad of the transferred persons , the [MISC Algerian  ] Government indicated that measures of this nature will be taken only in the framework of legislative provisions in force . 
FINAL MINUTES AS INITIALED BY HEADS OF DELEGATION --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) BEGIN TEXT OF MINUTES: [PER Mr. John Clint WILLIAMSON  ] , Ambassador at Large for [MISC War Crimes Issues  ] at the [ORG U.S. Department of State  ] , conducted a working visit to [LOC Algiers  ] from April 20 to 22 , 2007 , accompanied by a delegation composed of representatives from the [ORG Department of State  ] , the [ORG Department of Defense  ] and the [ORG National Security Council  ] . 
During his visit , [PER Mr. John Clint WILLIAMSON  ] called on Mr. [PER Mohammed BEDJAOUI  ] , Minister of [LOC State  ] , Minister of [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] , to whom he delivered a letter from Secretary of [ORG State  ] [PER Condoleezza RICE  ] . 
He was also received at the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] . 
A bilateral meeting bringing together delegations from the two countries ( the members of which appear on the attached list ) took place at [LOC Residence El Mithak  ] on April 21 and 22 , 2007 , under the chairmanship of Mr. [PER Mohamed Kamel REZAG BARA  ] , Counselor to the President of the [LOC Republic  ] , and [PER Mr. John Clint WILLIAMSON  ] , Ambassador at Large for [MISC War Crimes Issues  ] at the [ORG U.S. Department of State  ] . 
The discussions concerned the situation of [MISC Algerian  ] nationals detained at the [LOC U.S. Naval Base  ] at [LOC Guantanamo  ] . 
The [MISC Algerian  ] [ORG Delegation  ] and the [ORG American Delegation  ] expressed their great satisfaction with the quality of relations that exist between the PeopleQ , s [LOC Democratic Republic  ] of [LOC Algeria  ] and the [LOC United States  ] of [LOC America  ] and with the perspectives for their expansion and strengthening . 
Both Delegations particularly expressed their joint will to reach a comprehensive settlement concerning the situation of [MISC Algerian  ] nationals detained in the [LOC U.S. Naval Base  ] at [LOC Guantanamo  ] . 
This settlement can be finalized according to a timetable and practical modalities to be defined through discussions between the two Delegations by the end of May 2007 . 
The [MISC Algerian  ] [ORG Delegation  ] indicated that it had no objection to the transfer of the [MISC Algerian  ] nationals whose [MISC Algerian  ] nationality is established , to [LOC Algeria  ] or to another country of their choice . 
The [MISC Algerian  ] [ORG Delegation  ] stated that in all cases , its nationals will be brought before the national judicial authority , which will ultimately determine their status . 
The [MISC Algerian  ] [ORG Delegation  ] underscored that [MISC Algerian  ] legislation criminalizes membership by any [MISC Algerian  ] national in a terrorist organization abroad , even if acts committed are not directed against [LOC Algeria  ] . 
With respect to the concerns expressed by the [ORG American Delegation  ] about the treatment of the [MISC Algerian  ] nationals after their return to [LOC Algeria  ] , the two [MISC Delegations  ] , after an exchange of information , agreed that these concerns are dealt with , at a political level , by the consistent commitment of [LOC Algeria  ] to the fight against international terrorism and , at a legal level , by [MISC Algerian  ] legislation as well as by virtue of the obligations assumed by [LOC Algeria  ] in the framework of the different pertinent international conventions to which it has adhered , notably the [ORG Universal Declaration of Human Rights  ] , the [ORG Convention  ] against [ORG Torture  ] and [PER Other Cruel  ] , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment , and the [ORG International Convention  ] on the Elimination of [ORG All Forms of Racial Discrimination  ] , as well as the body of international instruments relating to human rights and the arrangements concluded with the [ORG ICRC  ] . 
Within the framework of relevant [ORG UN Security Council Resolutions for  ] combating terrorism , particularly [ORG UNSCR  ] 1373/01 , the two [MISC Delegations  ] decided to reinforce their cooperation through necessary and appropriate measures , notably through the exchange of information and intelligence , with the goal of preventing these persons from being able to become involved in terrorist activities . 
Taking account of the preceding , the two [MISC Delegations  ] accepted the principle , as a first step , upon the agreement of practical modalities , of the transfer of detainees whose names are as follows: - TRARI [PER Mohamed  ] - [PER FEGHOUL Abdelli  ] - [PER HAMLILI Mustapha  ] - [PER ABBAR Houari  ] - [PER GHALLAB Bachir  ] - [PER HADJ-ARAB Nabil  ] Due to his health condition , [PER Sofiane HADERBACHE  ] is to be transferred as soon as possible .
