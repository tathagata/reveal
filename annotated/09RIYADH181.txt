( C ) SUMMARY & COMMENT: Netherlands Ambassador [PER Ron Strikker  ] , [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador [PER Victor Gibinvish  ] , and Embassy [LOC Riyadh  ] Pol/Mil Counselor [PER Scott McGehee  ] met on January 25 with Dr. [PER Prince Turki Al-Kabeer  ] , Undersecretary for [ORG Multilateral Affairs  ] at the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] , to deliver a joint demarche on the [ORG Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism  ] ( GICNT ) . 
The meeting evolved into a pointed exchange between the [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador and Dr. [PER Prince Turki  ] on [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear ambitions . 
[PER Prince Turki  ] warned that if [LOC Iran  ] tried to produce nuclear weapons , other countries in the [LOC Gulf  ] region would be compelled to do the same , or to permit the stationing of nuclear weapons in the [LOC Gulf  ] to serve as a deterrent to the [MISC Iranians  ] . 
[PER Turki  ] then pointedly demanded that the [LOC US  ] keep [MISC Saudi  ] officials informed about [LOC US  ] plans for [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Dr. [PER Prince Turki  ] is not a decision-maker , but he is a reliable transmitter of official [MISC Saudi  ] thinking . 
Most of what he said is not new , although this is the most explicit mention we have heard of [MISC Saudi  ] willingness to see nuclear weapons deployed in the [ORG GCC  ] as a deterrent to [LOC Iran  ] . 
His concern that the [LOC United States  ] will negotiate a " grand bargain " with [LOC Iran  ] without consulting [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] is a concern we have heard often in recent weeks . 
End summary & comment. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) After hearing a brief verbal demarche from Ambassador [PER Strikker  ] on the upcoming June Plenary of the GICNT , Dr. [PER Turki  ] turned to Ambassador [PER Gibinvish  ] , saying , " On this issue , what concerns us most is how to get our neighbor to change its policy on enrichment . 
" [LOC Iran  ] needs to be convinced to enter a dialogue on this matter , he continued , noting that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] is also concerned about the [MISC Russian-built  ] reactor at [LOC Bushehr  ] . 
A leakage from a plant at that location could bring an environmental catastrophe to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , pointing out that it is located less than 300 kilometers away from [MISC Saudi  ] shores , across open water. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Gibinvish  ] was able to say only " Sure , I agree ! 
" before Prince continued , " The location is so dangerous ! 
Not just to us , but to the world economy ! 
" He urged that [LOC Russia  ] use its influence to have the reactor moved north , suggesting that a location on the shore of the [LOC Caspian Sea  ] would be much better , where there is water available for reactor cooling , and where mountains rise behind to contain any possible leakage from moving south . 
Perhaps more troubling , he said , is [LOC Iran  ] 's pursuit of nuclear enrichment . 
He explained that if [LOC Iran  ] tries to produce nuclear weapons , other countries in the [LOC Gulf  ] region would be compelled to do the same , or to permit the stationing of nuclear weapons in the [LOC Gulf  ] to serve as a deterrent to the [MISC Iranians.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Amb . 
[PER Gibinvish  ] responded that [LOC Iran  ] 's desire to enrich uranium reflected its fears that it will someday be attacked by [LOC Israel  ] or the [LOC United States  ] and also a sign of [LOC Iran  ] 's desire to establish its " supremacy " in the region . 
[PER Prince Turki  ] interjected: " And we cannot accept [MISC Iranian  ] supremacy in the region . 
We are okay with nuclear electrical power and desalination , but not with enrichment . 
" He said that the prospect of [MISC Iranian  ] enrichment raises troubling questions about their motivations for doing so: " they do not need it ! 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) Amb . 
[PER Gibinvish  ] noted that " some experts in [LOC Russia  ] believe that [LOC Iran  ] will have a bomb in 10 to 15 years . 
" [LOC Russia  ] , he said , is concerned about this matter as well , and has " put forward initiatives " with [LOC Iran  ] . 
[LOC Russia  ] hopes to discuss this further with [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] in the near future , and he said that an " important delegation " would be coming to [LOC Riyadh  ] in about two months to discuss this with the [MISC Saudi  ] leadership . 
[PER Prince Turki  ] said that the [MISC Russian  ] delegation would be welcomed , stressing that " we must work together to get them to abandon their effort to acquire nuclear weapons . 
[LOC Israel  ] too , he said , must be convinced to surrender its nuclear arsenal . 
But you deal with them , you have influence , that is why I raise this with you . 
" Amb . 
[PER Gibinvish  ] pledged that " we will do what we can . 
But the [MISC Iranians  ] are difficult partners . 
" At this point , [PER Prince Turki  ] turned to Pol/Mil Counselor who had momentarily stopped taking notes . 
[PER Prince Turki  ] said " Please write this down . 
Whatever is discussed with the [MISC Iranians  ] , we must be kept informed ! 
Any [ORG RIYADH  ] 00000181 002 OF 002 negotiations with the [MISC Iranians  ] must take into account the interests of [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , otherwise , we will not accept it ! 
We should be told -- in advance ! -- of what you plan to say .
