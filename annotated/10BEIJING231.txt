Huntsman  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) and ( e ) . 
1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY . 
We face a challenging year ahead in [MISC U.S.-China  ] relations . 
Ten percent [LOC U.S.  ] unemployment coupled with our huge trade deficit with [LOC China  ] , [LOC China  ] , s increasing use of industrial policies to restrict market access , and an undervalued RMB , will bring greater tension to bilateral ties . 
The [ORG Google  ] case adds fuel to the fire . 
In this context , it is critical that we find ways to better advance our bilateral economic policy . 
This will require sustained , focused interaction on a daily basis with the [MISC Chinese  ] , but also serious thinking about what can best be accomplished in the run-up to and at key meetings like the [ORG S&ED  ] and [ORG JCCT  ] . 
We need to find ways to keep the relationship positive , but even more important to ensure the [MISC American  ] worker , in particular , reaps the benefits of our bilateral economic engagement . 
2 . 
( C ) We offer below some ideas on how we can move ahead on a concerted , targeted [LOC U.S.  ] effort to boost [LOC U.S.  ] job-creating exports of goods and services to [LOC China  ] as well as increased job-creating [MISC Chinese  ] investment and tourism to the [LOC United States  ] . 
While we will continue to aggressively negotiate removal of [MISC Chinese  ] barriers , we will need as well to get [MISC Chinese  ] buy-in to several job-boosting initiatives . 
There are even things we can do ourselves unilaterally . 
Taken together , measures would include: - expanding sector-specific public private partnerships , - offering [MISC SMEs China-specific  ] support , - building or retooling existing export promotion mechanisms , - making educational offerings in the [LOC U.S.  ] more attractive ( and in the process giving new generations of [MISC Chinese  ] a reason for wanting to be in the [LOC U.S.  ] market ) , - increasing pull factors for [MISC Chinese  ] tourism to and investment in the [LOC U.S.  ] , and - enhancing the use of the [MISC Internet  ] and other electronic means of communication in [MISC Chinese  ] . 
3 . 
( C ) We are aware that in a resource constrained environment , some of these will cost money , but we judge that the benefits will outweigh the costs and have a significant job-creating component . 
Some suggestions may be more palatable than others , and costs will vary widely , but we emphasize again that the potential benefits of each are substantial . 
Of course we need to do a better job in helping [MISC Americans  ] understand that the [LOC China  ] trade relationship can actually be a good story for [LOC U.S.  ] jobs and pay dividends far beyond the trade sector . 
One final note: we accent the positive here in terms of what we can do but we certainly do not neglect that the continuing need to use available trade remedies and [ORG WTO  ] consistent retaliatory action to ensure fairness and transparency . 
END SUMMARY . 
A ROUGH YEAR AHEAD , BUT OPPORTUNITIES ARE ENORMOUS --------------------------------------------- ----- 4 . 
( C ) Whereas 2009 was a year to build the [MISC U.S.-China  ] relationship , 2010 will be a year that tests it . 
Strong [MISC Chinese  ] economic and export growth coupled with an artificially undervalued RMB will further heighten focus on our huge trade deficit with [LOC China  ] . 
Widespread perceptions that [LOC China  ] , s industrial policies are rolling back market access add to the overall sense that [LOC China  ] plays unfairly in the global marketplace . 
Other emerging issues , like [ORG Google  ] , s problems and new rules on indigenous innovation , create a drumbeat of bad news stories for firms seeking to do [LOC BEIJING  ] 00000231 002 OF 007 business in [LOC China  ] . 
And as backdrop , the [MISC Chinese  ] continue to signal intense displeasure with [LOC U.S.  ] positions on issues from the [PER Dalai Lama  ] to [LOC Taiwan  ] arms sales and [MISC Internet  ] freedom , which they then cite as reasons why they may not cooperate with the [LOC U.S.  ] on other issues . 
5 . 
( C ) Yet , with ten percent [LOC U.S.  ] unemployment , more than ever before we must ensure that our relations with [LOC China  ] continue to pay real dividends -- especially in creating jobs for [MISC Americans  ] . 
[LOC China  ] is the world , s fastest growing major economy and should be providing opportunities for [LOC U.S.  ] goods and services exports . 
[MISC Chinese  ] companies , thanks to government-backed loans , monopolies and preferential treatment , are awash in cash and should be a source for investment in the [LOC U.S.  ] economy -- investment that would help maintain and create jobs in the [LOC U.S.  ] And , [LOC China  ] , s rapidly growing middle and upper classes , while still only representing a fraction of its population , measure many tens of millions . 
They should provide an enormous pool of potential consumers of [LOC U.S.  ] goods and services as well as tourism and education in the [LOC U.S.  ] 6 . 
( C ) Virtually every major [LOC U.S.  ] company has a presence in [LOC China  ] . 
They recognize the potential and are trying hard to work around the obstacles to market access that [LOC China  ] erects . 
For many of them , [LOC China  ] was their sole profit-center during last year , s global economic downturn . 
However , for the small and medium-sized enterprises ( [MISC SMEs  ] ) that are the engine of job creation in the [LOC United States  ] , exporting to or doing business in [LOC China  ] is still a daunting prospect . 
Overt market access barriers and regulatory constraints at the national and sub-national level increasingly and blatantly tilt the playing field to [MISC Chinese  ] companies’ advantage . 
[MISC Chinese  ] policies make it difficult to succeed in its market unless you establish a local presence , including production , something for which [MISC SMEs  ] generally have neither the capital nor expertise . 
The opacity of [LOC China  ] , s legal and regulatory systems and widespread official corruption also serve as barriers to [LOC U.S.  ] businesses -- especially [MISC SMEs  ] -- seeking to export to , or invest in , [LOC China  ] . 
The lack of effective [ORG IPR  ] protection , import-substitution policies , standards discriminate against foreign products and create obstacles to licensing of technology , and central and provincial/local government incentives to “buy local , ” additionally skew the playing field against foreign firms . 
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN: PERCEPTIONS OF [LOC U.S.  ] DISINCENTIVES TO TRAVEL , INVESTMENT --------------------------------------------- - 7 . 
( C ) Many in [LOC China  ] perceive the [LOC U.S.  ] as “closed” to [MISC Chinese  ] and [MISC Chinese  ] companies . 
[MISC Chinese  ] businesspersons looking at investment opportunities around the globe are confused and intimidated by the different investment regulations and promotional activities in the fifty [LOC U.S.  ] states . 
Businesspersons , potential tourists and students remain confused by [LOC U.S.  ] visa regulations and , particularly in contrasting them with those of our competitors in [LOC Japan  ] and [LOC Europe  ] , perceive them as more restrictive than they actually are , even seeing them as “hostile” to [MISC Chinese  ] travelers . 
Many [MISC Chinese  ] and some [LOC U.S.  ] firms complain that [LOC U.S.  ] export controls are out-dated and costing us business as [MISC Chinese  ] buyers travel to [LOC Europe  ] to buy the same goods or services they cannot buy from [MISC American  ] suppliers . 
JOB-BOOSTING APPROACHES: PROPOSED SOLUTIONS ------------------------------------------- 8 . 
( C ) There are no easy solutions to many of these challenges . 
However , we offer a range of possible initiatives and policy measures for interagency consideration that could help advance our efforts to maximize job-creating benefits from our relations with [LOC China  ] . 
The proposals we [LOC BEIJING  ] 00000231 003 OF 007 offer below include ones that would require [MISC Chinese  ] buy in as well as some that the [LOC U.S.  ] could initiate unilaterally . 
They are not exhaustive nor are they intended to substitute for continued aggressive negotiation of market access , but instead are meant to provide additional complementary actions to enhance our economic relations and achieve greater benefits for the [MISC American  ] people . 
WIELDING STICKS --------------- 9 . 
( C ) Recent issues related to indigenous innovation , express delivery and on-line music content , for example , underscore that USG complaints about discriminatory policies - absent a credible threat of retaliatory action or other leverage -- are falling on increasingly deaf [MISC Chinese  ] ears . 
[LOC China  ] , s relatively strong economic position in the wake of the global financial crisis has intensified that trend . 
As has [MISC Chinese  ] hubris that it can call the shots and determine the playbook under which it operates without disclosing the same to foreign firms . 
While [ORG WTO  ] dispute settlement has worked well when applied , many of the problems we face in [LOC China  ] , s market do not fall within [ORG WTO  ] disciplines . 
We may want to consider ways to toughen up our talking points and enhance the use -- or perception of likely use -- of other real “sticks” in order to achieve market opening , job-creating objectives . 
This will require some consideration of just how much disruption in our economic relations we are willing to countenance if we must carry through on threats . 
-- HIGHLIGHT TO [MISC CHINESE  ] POSSIBLE CONGRESSIONAL ACTION on hot-button issues like [MISC Renminbi  ] valuation and carbon tariffs on [MISC Chinese  ] imports . 
-- EMPHASIZE THAT [LOC CHINA  ] , S INDUSTRIAL AND EXPORT-PROMOTION POLICIES WILL PROVOKE 421 CASES to be filed and positively considered . 
-- COORDINATE CHINA-DIRECTED TRADE AND ECONOMIC POLICY IN BILATERAL OR MULTILATERAL SETTINGS with the [ORG EU  ] and other trading partners , especially in [LOC Southeast Asia  ] , that face similar challenges with [LOC China  ] . 
-- CONTINUE TO PURSUE AS APPROPRIATE [ORG WTO  ] CASES , with emphasis on sectors most closely tied to [LOC U.S.  ] jobs . 
Consider possibility of using lower “probable victory” standard in deciding whether to initiate such cases . 
FOCUS OUR ENGAGEMENT ON JOBS ----------------------------- 10 . 
( C ) Given current [LOC U.S.  ] unemployment levels we suggest the interagency prioritize our objectives over the next year on those areas most likely to create jobs in the [LOC U.S.  ] In particular , we suggest: -- AN OVERARCHING FOCUS ON OPENING CHINESE MARKETS TO EXPORTS OF [LOC U.S.  ] SERVICES in all of the key [MISC U.S.-China  ] bilateral economic fora in 2010 , including the [MISC S&ED  ] and JCCT . 
For example , a strong push to eliminate joint venture requirements in select services sectors could be negotiated in exchange for a [MISC Chinese-sought  ] concession . 
-- PRIORITIZE OUR “ASKS” OF [LOC CHINA  ] ON GOODS SECTORS THAT HAVE HIGHEST JOB-CREATION POTENTIAL AND STRONG [MISC CHINESE  ] GROWTH POTENTIAL , and intensify our advocacy in these areas through the methods outlined below . 
BANG FOR THE BUCK: INCREASE AND DIVERSIFY EXPORT PROMOTION --------------------------------------------- 11 . 
( C ) Since 2005 , very conservative estimates show that [LOC BEIJING  ] 00000231 004 OF 007 [LOC U.S.  ] exports of goods to [LOC China  ] created 285,000 jobs in the [LOC United States  ] . 
In that same period , every dollar of funding for export promotion activities facilitated an average of USD 617 in exports to [LOC China  ] . 
While many of the programs listed below would require either a shift in or new funding , those investments would quickly payoff . 
To increase [LOC U.S.  ] exports to [LOC China  ] in the near and medium term , it is essential that we expand and enhance existing export promotion programs , including: -- EXPAND SECTOR-SPECIFIC PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS . 
For example , the highly successful [ORG Aviation Cooperation Program  ] , or [ORG ACP  ] , was founded with support from the [ORG U.S. Trade and Development Agency  ] ( [ORG TDA  ] ) . 
It now has over 40 corporate members , sponsored training for over 100 [MISC Chinese  ] aviation professionals , and has introduced [LOC U.S.  ] firms and technology throughout [LOC China  ] , s aviation industry and regulatory structure . 
USG participation has helped [LOC U.S.  ] firms build relationships with local officials that are crucial to doing business here . 
Likewise , an [ORG Energy Cooperation Program  ] was established in 2009 along these same lines and healthcare is a strong candidate for immediate consideration for a similar new partnership . 
-- OFFER SMEs INCENTIVES TO TEST NEW MARKETS HERE . 
[LOC Japan  ] , [LOC Korea  ] , and [LOC Germany  ] offer SMEs loans or subsidies to offset costs of travel , trade show participation , market entry , and business matchmaking . 
They help companies develop procurement strategies to be more price competitive . 
Such measures are currently proscribed under the [LOC U.S.  ] system . 
-- TELL THE STATES WE ARE READY TO HELP: Present at Annual [ORG Governor’s Association  ] meeting and other state venues on Mission services to help their states connect to counterparts in [LOC China  ] . 
-- [ORG ESTABLISH  ] FEDERAL AND/OR STATE-LEVEL INCUBATOR PROGRAMS , which help companies during market entry by Leveraging public-private partnerships to support new exporters . 
The [MISC German  ] government partners with the [MISC German  ] Chamber of [ORG Commerce  ] in supporting the [MISC German  ] [ORG Center Beijing  ] . 
For start-up companies , the [ORG Center  ] offers office space , conference facilities , in-depth counseling and practical advice from lawyers , accountants and market and sales professionals . 
In-house service providers assist [MISC German  ] companies with a full range of services helping them compete . 
By developing public-private partnerships that join business expertise and government assistance , the USG could offer comparable one-stop service to [LOC U.S.  ] companies to help level the playing field with competitors . 
-- DUPLICATE THE “COOPERATOR” PROGRAMS of the [ORG Foreign Agricultural Service  ] ( [ORG FAS  ] ) in other sectors . 
[ORG FAS  ] spends $25 million annually on cooperator programs in [LOC China  ] to help companies create , expand and maintain long-term export markets for [LOC U.S.  ] agricultural products . 
Those funds are matched by industry . 
[ORG TDA  ] funds might help . 
-- FURTHER EXPAND FCS ACTIVITY IN [LOC CHINA  ] , one of the most effective ways to spur export promotion . 
This will have a big bang for the buck in terms of across-the-board commercial outreach . 
-- FUND THE HIRING OF FCS EXPORT-PROMOTION CONTRACTORS IN THE 14 [MISC CHINESE  ] SECOND-TIER CITIES that have been identified by [ORG Commerce  ] as having the best [LOC U.S.  ] export opportunities ( these 14 cities , each of which has a population in excess of one million , currently receive 53% of all [LOC U.S.  ] exports to [LOC China  ] ) . 
-- CAPITALIZE ON [MISC CHINESE  ] OUTWARD DIRECT INVESTMENT TO THIRD COUNTRIES . 
For example , the [MISC Embassy  ] could organize match-making events to introduce [LOC U.S.  ] upstream design and managerial services firms to [MISC Chinese  ] design/build firms that [LOC BEIJING  ] 00000231 005 OF 007 have contracts for infrastructure projects using [LOC PRC  ] concessional loans in [LOC Asia  ] , [LOC Africa  ] and [LOC Latin America  ] . 
-- SEEK TO REDUCE [LOC U.S.  ] EXPORT CONTROLS ON SALES OF JOB-CREATING TECHNOLOGIES that are readily available from our allied competitors ( semiconductors manufacturing equipment , microwave chambers , composite prepregs ) . 
We know that there is an ongoing discuss about export controls in the [LOC U.S.  ] and well recognize the national security implications of how we view export controls . 
ENCOURAGE [MISC CHINESE  ] INVESTMENT IN THE [LOC U.S.  ] ---------------------------------------- 12 . 
( C ) Apart from misperceptions of an unwelcoming political Environment and periodic complaints that key high tech investments are denied routinely due to CFIUS concerns , [MISC Chinese  ] companies view the [LOC U.S.  ] economy as an attractive investment destination . 
Dispelling harmful myths and actively promoting direct [MISC Chinese  ] investment would help us capture a larger share of [LOC China  ] , s rapidly growing ODI levels ( [LOC PRC  ] ODI to the world roughly doubled from $27 billion in 2007 to $56 billion in 2008 ) , which in turn would create more [LOC U.S.  ] jobs . 
In this regard , the following steps should be considered: -- THE [MISC INTERNET  ] . 
We should create many more [MISC Chinese  ] language websites that are directed at key secondary and tertiary cities in [LOC China  ] . 
The more we facilitate access to information about [MISC American  ] business opportunities -- whether through a national database or enhanced state and local databases -- the better . 
We believe thinking local , start-ups and grassroots first is the preferable way to go in using the Internet -- ENHANCE THE ADMINISTRATION’S INVEST IN [MISC AMERICA PROGRAM  ] . 
Other countries have national promotion programs that work with [MISC Chinese  ] companies to help them identify industry clusters or target locations based on their criteria . 
-- DIRECT FEDERAL FUNDS TO SUPPORT STATE INVESTMENT-SPONSORED BUYING OR INVESTMENT MISSIONS originating in [LOC China  ] . 
-- ADD INVESTMENT PROMOTION TO THE AGENDA OF VISITING CABINET AND OTHER HIGH-LEVEL OFFICIALS ( conduct roundtables with influential [MISC Chinese  ] business leaders who could move substantial investment to the [LOC United States  ] ) . 
-- CONDUCT A PUBLIC DIPLOMACY CAMPAIGN to erase misperceptions about the scope of CFIUS restraints , including use of existing bilateral fora like the [MISC S&ED  ] , Investment Forum , and [ORG JCCT  ] and “investment missions” to provincial capitals and second-tier cities . 
-- EXTEND THE VALIDITY OF [LOC U.S.  ] B-1/B-2 visas for [MISC Chinese  ] travelers . 
EXPANDING TOURISM AND EDUCATIONAL TRAVEL ---------------------------------------- 13 . 
( C ) A fundamental [MISC Chinese  ] misperception that our doors are closed constrains growth in [MISC Chinese  ] travel to the [LOC U.S.  ] across a wide range of categories , as does the confusing diversity of state-level programs on tourism and education . 
A rich and sustained effort to overcome these factors could pay rapid and substantial job-creating dividends . 
We need to create a buzz in the street that travel to [LOC America  ] for business for other reasons is actually pretty easy . 
And that traveling in [LOC America  ] is generally easy and without restrictions . 
We propose the [LOC U.S.  ] consider: -- [ORG ESTABLISH  ] A CHINA-SPECIFIC TRAVEL AND TOURISM AUTHORITY . 
[LOC BEIJING  ] 00000231 006 OF 007 A national body to encourage the rapidly growing pool of [MISC Chinese  ] tourists to spend leisure time in the [LOC U.S.  ] could accelerate growth in individual travel and boost group travel . 
Local [LOC U.S.  ] tourism offices need help understanding what attracts [MISC Chinese  ] visitors . 
-- DUPLICATE IN OTHER FIRST-TIER [MISC CHINESE  ] CITIES THE NATIONAL TOURISM ASSOCIATION ( [ORG NTA  ] ) program office that was created in [LOC DOC  ] , s [ORG Shanghai Commercial Center  ] ( [ORG NTA  ] received a supporting Market [PER Cooperator Grant  ] ) . 
-- INCREASE THE FREQUENCY OF OUTREACH PROGRAMS to educate [MISC Chinese  ] public on the visa process , including intense public diplomacy through media channels . 
The more visitors , the more money they will spend and we enhanced “see America” program will create good service sector related jobs in the travel and tourism industry . 
-- SEEK TO EXTEND VISA RECIPROCITY FROM ONE TO FIVE YEARS IN ALL VISA CATEGORIES . 
The [MISC Embassy  ] has just negotiated the extension of visa reciprocity for select categories to five years . 
Expanding this to all visa categories would dramatically help promote [LOC U.S.  ] openness to legitimate travel . 
( By contrast , [LOC U.S.  ] visa reciprocity with [LOC Thailand  ] is ten years . 
) -- EXPAND STATE , S EDUCATIONAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS INITIATIVES to provide student advising and enhance student mobility between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC China  ] as well as to support [MISC American  ] universities , professional and technical training efforts to bring more [MISC Chinese  ] adult students to the [LOC United States  ] for training . 
It is notable that the number of [MISC Chinese  ] in the [LOC United States  ] for non-university education has nearly doubled in the last few years , demonstrating that [LOC U.S.  ] education services are sought by [MISC Chinese  ] and are an industry in which jobs could be created . 
-- EXPAND FEDERAL DIRECTION AND SUPPORT TO PROMOTE community and state college recruitment of [MISC Chinese  ] graduate and undergraduate students . 
-- WORK TO CHANGE [MISC CHINESE  ] PERCEPTIONS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF UNIVERSITY RANKINGS and promote enrollment in a broader range of [LOC U.S.  ] institutions . 
DANGLING CARROTS ---------------- 14 . 
( C ) Where [LOC China  ] is already seeking assistance from us or encouraging investment , we should capitalize on that interest for job promotion . 
For example: -- ADVERTISE MORE EFFECTIVELY FOREIGN-FRIENDLY INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN [LOC CHINA  ] , especially those that are already with [LOC PRC  ] encouragement and which are tied to follow-on [LOC U.S.  ] goods exports ( current examples include mining and logistics management ) . 
-- IDENTIFY AND REDUCE USG-CREATED BARRIERS TO GROWTH IN THOSE SECTORS WITH THE MOST POTENTIAL IN [LOC CHINA  ] . 
Green technologies is the most potent example . 
[LOC U.S.  ] subsidies to [LOC R&D  ] in green technologies , specifically solar panels , expire biannually . 
That unpredictability stymies long-term [LOC R&D  ] by [LOC U.S.  ] companies in the field , a detriment to their competitiveness in the industry . 
Establishing a long-term program for [LOC R&D  ] would increase [LOC U.S.  ] competitiveness . 
-- LEVERAGE [MISC CHINESE  ] INTEREST IN TECHNICAL EXCHANGES WITH [ORG EPA  ] , [ORG FDA  ] AND OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES to extract specific commitments on expanded market opportunities for [MISC U.S.-based  ] services in related fields , consistent with [LOC U.S.  ] health and safety interests . 
[LOC BEIJING  ] 00000231 007 OF 007 -- RE-EXAMINE EXPORT CONTROLS ON COMMERCIALLY-IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGY being made available to [LOC China  ] by allied competitors ( i.e. semiconductor manufacturing equipment ; aviation ; [ORG EMC  ] and microwave chambers ) .
