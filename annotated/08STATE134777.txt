STATE 125608 [PER B. KABUL  ] 346 [PER C. KHAN-MORIMOTO  ] E-MAIL ( 12/10/2008 ) Classified By: PM Assistant Secretary [PER Mark T.

( U ) This is an action request . 
See para 2. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary and Action Request: Contrary to previous statements to the [LOC U.S. Government  ] , the Government of the [LOC Islamic Republic of Afghanistan  ] joined 93 other states in signing the [MISC Convention on Cluster  ] Munitions ( [ORG CCM  ] ) , December 3-4 , 2008 in [LOC Oslo  ] , [LOC Norway  ] . 
The [LOC United States  ] did not sign the treaty as cluster munitions continue to have military utility . 
The [LOC U.S. Government  ] believes [ORG Article  ] 21 of the [ORG Convention  ] provides the flexibility for signatories to continue to cooperate and conduct operations with [LOC U.S.  ] forces , and in turn for [LOC U.S.  ] forces to store , transfer , and use [LOC U.S.  ] cluster munitions in the territory of a [ORG State Party  ] . 
The [ORG Department requests that Post  ] approach appropriate interlocutors at the [MISC Afghan  ] Ministries of [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] and [ORG Defense  ] to urge [LOC Kabul  ] to interpret [ORG Article  ] 21 in a similar manner , minimizing any potential impact of [LOC Afghanistan  ] , s signature of the [MISC Convention on U.S.  ] operations and military cooperation . 
Given the political sensitivities in [LOC Afghanistan  ] surrounding cluster munitions as well as air and artillery strikes in general , the [ORG Department believes  ] that a low-profile approach will be the best way to ensure a common understanding that the [ORG CCM  ] does not impede military planning and operations between our two governments . 
A copy of the [ORG CCM  ] will be e-mailed to [ORG Post  ] . 
End Summary and Action Request . 
OBJECTIVES ---------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Department requests Post  ] pursue the following objectives with the Government of the [LOC Islamic Republic of Afghanistan  ] ( [ORG GIRoA  ] ) Ministries of [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] and [ORG Defense  ] . 
[ORG Post  ] may also draw on points in ref A and the background below . 
A copy of the [ORG CCM  ] text will be e-mailed to [ORG Post  ] . 
-- Reassure [ORG GIRoA  ] the [LOC United States  ] shares [LOC Afghanistan  ] , s humanitarian concerns and expends great effort to reduce the unintended risk to civilians from cluster munitions during and after armed conflict . 
-- Urge [ORG GIRoA  ] to take full advantage of the flexibility afforded by [ORG Article  ] 21 of the [MISC Convention on Cluster  ] Munitions ( [ORG CCM  ] ) that allows for continued “military cooperation and operations” between a signatory and a non-signatory . 
[ORG Article  ] 21 also covers all preparations for future military operations , transit of cluster munitions through [LOC Afghanistan  ] , s territory , and storage and potential use of cluster munitions on [LOC Afghanistan  ] , s territory . 
-- Emphasize that a narrow interpretation of [ORG Article  ] 21 by [ORG GIRoA  ] will impair our ability to defend the lives of our soldiers as well as those of [LOC Afghanistan  ] and Coalition partners . 
-- Share with [ORG GIRoA  ] the [ORG U.S. Department of Defense Policy  ] on Cluster Munitions and Unintended Harm to [MISC Civilians  ] , signed by Secretary Gates on June 19 , 2008 . 
( Text can be found at: http://www.defenselink.mil/news/d20080709cmpo licy.pdf . 
) -- Request that [ORG GIRoA  ] pass to the [ORG USG  ] any concerns impacting military operations in [LOC Afghanistan  ] through bilateral channels . 
-- IF RAISED: The [LOC United States  ] currently has a very small stockpile of cluster munitions in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
In certain circumstances , they are the most effective system to use against light armor , wheeled vehicles , materiel , and personnel , while at the same time limiting collateral damage . 
Not allowing the use of cluster munitions will increase risk to coalition forces engaged in combat from enemy counter-fire , reduce responsiveness , decrease the number of different targets that can be attacked within a specified timeframe , and will substantially increase risks of collateral damage by requiring usage of a greater number of large , unitary warheads to accomplish the same mission . 
Cluster munitions employment would comply with the laws of war to include a painstaking collateral methodology and target development process , and only when absolutely necessary . 
REPORTING DEADLINE ------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) Embassy should report results of efforts by cable to [MISC PM/WRA  ] [PER Katherine Baker  ] before January 5 , 2009 . 
BACKGROUND ---------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Despite assurances to the contrary from President [PER Karzai  ] and Foreign Minister [PER Spanta  ] to Ambassador [PER Wood  ] in February 2008 ( ref B ) , the [ORG GIRoA  ] joined 93 other states in signing the [ORG CCM  ] , December 3-4 , 2008 in [LOC Oslo  ] , [LOC Norway  ] . 
According to timely [ORG Post  ] reporting , President [PER Karzai  ] decided at the last moment to overrule [PER Spanta  ] and sign the [ORG CCM  ] without prior consultation with the [ORG USG  ] or other key states engaged in operations in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Information from [ORG Post  ] and the press indicates that even ardent supporters of the [ORG CCM  ] who had been lobbying [LOC Kabul  ] for some time were unaware of the change in policy until December 3 , when [LOC Afghanistan  ] formally signed the treaty . 
Moreover , at least parts of the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] appeared unaware of the policy change , as of December 10 ( ref C ) . 
Given the political sensitivities in [LOC Afghanistan  ] surrounding cluster munitions as well as air and artillery strikes in general , the [ORG Department believes  ] that a relatively low-profile dialogue at the sub-ministerial level will be the best way to ensure a common understanding between the [ORG USG  ] and [ORG GIRoA  ] that the [ORG CCM  ] does not impede [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG ISAF  ] military planning and operations. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG CCM  ] signature does not automatically result in restrictions on the plans and operations of the [ORG International Security Assistance Force  ] ( [ORG ISAF  ] ) or other organizations engaged in security operations in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The [LOC United States  ] interprets [ORG Article  ] 21 of the [ORG CCM  ] to enable non-signatories to continue to operate with those that have signed the treaty . 
Furthermore , the [LOC United States  ] reads the phrase “military cooperation and operations” in [ORG Article  ] 21 to include all preparations for future military operations , transit of cluster munitions through the territory of a [ORG State Party  ] , and storage and use of cluster munitions on the territory of a [ORG State Party  ] . 
Many of our [ORG NATO  ] Allies and other key partners share this interpretation . 
The [ORG NATO Military Committee  ] advice issued on September 30 , 2008 notes that [ORG Article  ] 21 provides the necessary flexibility to allow military cooperation among Allies that are party to the Convention and those that are not . 
Bilateral consultations with military allies and partners during the negotiation of the [ORG CCM  ] indicate that ongoing operations in [LOC Afghanistan  ] were a major factor in the inclusion of [ORG Article  ] 21 by would-be signatories , several being troop contributors to [ORG ISAF  ] . 
A narrow interpretation of the clause by [ORG GIRoA  ] would reverse the hard work of our Allies and partners in ensuring that the [ORG CCM  ] text included a clause on interoperability and combined operations. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) The [LOC United States  ] did not sign the [ORG CCM  ] as it constitutes a near-total ban on cluster munitions , which provide a vital military capability and remain a legitimate weapon when used properly and in accordance with existing international humanitarian law . 
We believe that the elimination of cluster munitions from our stockpiles would put the lives of our soldiers and those of our coalition partners at risk . 
Without cluster munitions it becomes more difficult to fulfill our security guarantees to others . 
We are not aware of any munition that offers the same combination of range , economy of force , responsiveness , and flexibility as cluster munitions . 
Moreover , there are no easy substitutes , and possible alternatives ( carpet bombing , massed artillery barrages , etc . 
) have pronounced and potentially more adverse humanitarian impacts . 
We are working to improve our cluster munitions in order to reduce the unintended effects on civilians . 
While the current security environment in [LOC Afghanistan  ] may not necessarily lend itself to employment of cluster munitions , the situation remains dynamic so that the [LOC United States  ] cannot permanently preclude its use in the country. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As the [LOC United States  ] expands its forces in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , the likelihood of enemy contact will rise due to an increase in operations . 
It is critical for the [LOC United States  ] and Coalition partners to have the effects that cluster munitions can provide for the safety of our forces . 
The use of cluster munitions depends on the targeting sets and the effects desired against those targeting sets balanced with humanitarian considerations . 
Targeting sets would normally be light armor , wheeled vehicles , materiel , and personnel . 
Not allowing the use of cluster munitions will increases risk to Coalition forces engaged in combat from enemy counter-fire , reduce responsiveness , decrease the number of different targets that can be attacked within a specified timeframe , and will substantially increase risks of collateral damage by requiring usage of a greater number of large , unitary warheads to accomplish the same mission . 
Cluster munitions employment would comply with the laws of war . 
The rules of engagement would be stringent , and the collateral damage methodology and target development process would be painstaking , balancing military need with humanitarian concerns . 
[LOC U.S.  ] Attempts to [ORG Address Humanitarian Concerns  ] --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) The [LOC United States  ] is addressing the humanitarian impact of unexploded cluster munitions through multiple channels . 
On June 19 , Secretary [PER Gates  ] signed the new [ORG Department of Defense Policy  ] on Cluster Munitions and Unintended Harm to Civilians . 
The primary feature of this policy is the commitment that by 2018 , [LOC U.S.  ] armed forces will employ only those cluster munitions that , after arming , result in no more than 1 percent unexploded ordnance across the range of intended operational environments . 
Post-2018 , the [ORG USG  ] will not transfer cluster munitions that do not meet these criteria and , for any cluster munitions transferred prior to 2018 not meeting this standard , the recipient state must agree not to use them after 2018. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) In addition , the [ORG Department of State  ] and the [ORG Agency for International Development  ] will continue efforts to protect civilians from unexploded cluster munitions and explosive remnants of war ( [ORG ERW  ] ) through extensive survey , clearance , risk education assistance , and victims , assistance programs . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] is the largest single donor to these types of activities , providing over $1.4 billion since 1993 , including nearly $167.5 million for [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
( This figure includes assistance for clearance of landmines and all varieties of unexploded ordnance . 
) [ORG State Department  ] programs include both immediate post-conflict response and long-term assistance for affected states , including [LOC Afghanistan  ] where the [LOC United States  ] has had demining and [ORG ERW  ] clearance programs since 1988. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) Finally , the [LOC United States  ] continues to work towards a legally-binding Protocol on cluster munitions within the framework of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons ( [ORG CCW  ] ) . 
Unlike the [ORG CCM  ] , the [ORG CCW  ] includes most major states which use , produce , and/or stockpile the world , s cluster munitions ; many of them will not sign the [ORG CCM  ] . 
These states were willing to work towards finalizing an agreement in the [ORG CCW  ] that addresses both military and humanitarian concerns . 
Unfortunately , 25 of the strongest [ORG CCM  ] supporters blocked consensus towards a binding [ORG CCW  ] Protocol during the November 2008 negotiating session by demanding language virtually identical to that found in the [ORG CCM  ] . 
The [LOC United States  ] continues to support the [ORG CCW  ] negotiations and will participate in the 2009 GGE sessions ( February 16-20 and April 14-17 ) . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] has signed , but not ratified , the [MISC CCW.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 .
