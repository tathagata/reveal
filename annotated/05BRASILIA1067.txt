( C ) Summary . 
On April 18 , Ambassador and a visiting delegation from the [ORG State of Florida  ] met with Presidential Chief of Staff [PER Jose Dirceu  ] to discuss [LOC Miami  ] , s bid to become the permanent [ORG FTAA  ] secretariat site . 
[PER Dirceu  ] took the opportunity to state his desire that the [ORG FTAA  ] talks move forward , repeatedly declaring that [LOC Brazil  ] should export at least four times more to the [LOC U.S.  ] than it currently does ( [MISC USD$20  ] billion ) . 
Adding that he has already spoken to Finance Minister [PER Palocci  ] about the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] , s inflexibility on [ORG FTAA  ] issues , [PER Dirceu  ] said that next month both he and [PER Palocci  ] would seek to talk to President [PER Lula  ] about this . 
[LOC Florida  ] delegation members had varying reactions to [PER Dirceu  ] , s performance , with some seeing his remarks as a way to jump-start the stalled talks and others interpreting his statements as providing cover ( i.e. , that [LOC Brazil  ] has earnestly sought to bridge the impasse ) should the May 12 U.S.-Brazil Co-chair meeting fail to produce results . 
[PER Dirceu  ] barely touched upon [LOC Brazil  ] , s stance with respect to key issues of concern to the [LOC U.S.  ] , such as treatment of [ORG IPR  ] within the [ORG FTAA  ] common set . 
( In a subsequent conversation later that day , the [ORG GOB  ] , s Chief [ORG FTAA  ] policymaker [PER Regis Arslanian  ] told the delegation that Foreign Minister [PER Amorim  ] planned to push [LOC Brazil  ] , s 4 1 Mercosul-U.S . 
[ORG FTA  ] proposal in the Minister , s April 26 meeting with the Secretary in [LOC Brasilia  ] . 
) Ambassador took the occasion to raise with [PER Dirceu  ] USG concerns regarding potential [ORG GOB  ] compulsory licensing of [LOC HIV/AIDS  ] antiretroviral drugs produced by [LOC U.S.  ] firms ; [PER Dirceu  ] said that the [ORG GOB  ] would consult with the USG prior to any decision by President [PER Lula  ] . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On April 18 , Ambassador accompanied a visiting [ORG State of Florida  ] delegation to a meeting with Presidential Chief of Staff [PER Jose Dirceu  ] . 
The delegation ( consisting of [ORG Florida  ] Secretary of State [PER Glenda Hood  ] , [LOC Florida  ] [ORG FTAA  ] Chairman and former Amb . 
[PER Charles Cobb  ] , and [ORG Florida FTAA  ] President [PER Jorge Arrizurieta  ] ) sought to argue the case for [LOC Miami  ] as the site of any permanent [ORG FTAA Secretariat  ] . 
From the [MISC Brazilian  ] side , [PER Dirceu  ] was accompanied by [ORG Special Advisor Americo Fontenelle  ] . 
The meeting , scheduled to last a half-hour , instead went for twice that time. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) After the [ORG Florida  ] delegation spoke about prospects for [ORG CAFTA  ] ratification and the substantial trade links between [LOC Florida  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] , [PER Dirceu  ] briefed on his views . 
[LOC Brazil  ] currently exports about US$20 billion to the [LOC U.S.  ] , though it should be exporting at least four times that amount , he said . 
Because of the [ORG FTAA  ] stalemate , [LOC Brazil  ] was losing a historic opportunity to gain access to the [LOC U.S.  ] market , something he termed &a scandal.8 To sustain growth of 5 to 7 percent per year , [LOC Brazil  ] needed to increase the percentage of GDP devoted to investment to 25 percent ( versus 21.5 percent now ) and generate 2 million jobs per year . 
An [ORG FTAA  ] agreement , he declared , would help bring this badly-needed investment to [LOC Brazil  ] , further stimulate the country , s highly-competitive agro-industry sector , and help [LOC Brazil  ] increase its service sector exports . 
[PER Dirceu  ] claimed [LOC Brazil  ] could become a major player in the services sector , noting that currently 60 percent of the [MISC Brazilian  ] construction firm [ORG Odebrecht  ] , s earnings come from abroad. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Dirceu  ] commented that the [ORG FTAA  ] framework agreed to in the 2003 [ORG Miami Ministerial  ] was a good basis for negotiating and that the lack of progress in the current talks was due to the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] , s desire to further its regional integration goals at the expense of business concerns . 
What was needed to clear the logjam , he said , was to give the talks a political push . 
[PER Dirceu  ] stated that he had previously talked to Finance Minister [PER Palocci  ] about this issue , and that he would resume this discussion when the latter returned from his current trip to [LOC New York  ] . 
Thereupon , the two of them would approach President [PER Lula  ] in May to argue in favor of resuming [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations . 
Getting the [ORG Ministry of Agriculture  ] and influential business groups ( i.e. , the [ORG National Confederation of Industries  ] and the [LOC Sao Paulo State Industrial Federation  ] ) involved in the process was key , he added. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Dirceu  ] did note that there were practical problems ahead . 
Agriculture was a complex issue for both sides , though if an agreement could be reached in the [ORG WTO  ] limiting agricultural subsidies that would certainly help , he said . 
[PER Dirceu  ] recalled that in his previous conversation with the Secretary in [LOC Washington  ] he had pointed out that hot-button SIPDIS topics like cotton and sugar needed to be treated as commercial issues , not political ones . 
What would really send a bad signal &pessimo sinal8 to the [ORG GOB  ] , he thought , was any rejection by the [ORG US Congress  ] of [ORG CAFTA.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [LOC Florida  ] delegation members had varying reactions to [PER Dirceu  ] , s remarks . 
One participant in the meeting felt that [PER Dirceu  ] , s interest might provide newfound impetus to the stalled talks . 
Another felt that [PER Dirceu  ] might have been seeking to find a way forward should the scheduled May 21 U.S.-Brazil Co-chair discussions fail or position [LOC Brazil  ] as the party not responsible for any impasse. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Later that day , the [LOC Florida  ] delegation met with [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] Director of International Trade Negotiations [PER Regis Arslanian  ] , the [ORG GOB  ] policymaker directly responsible for the [ORG FTAA  ] talks . 
( It appears that , at [PER Dirceu  ] , s request , the level of the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] meeting was bumped up from Office Director to Assistant Secretary ) When asked by [PER Cobb  ] what he expected Minister [PER Amorim  ] to raise concerning the [ORG FTAA  ] with Secretary Rice during their April 26 meeting , [PER Arslanian  ] said no doubt the Minister would push [LOC Brazil  ] , s 4 1 Mercosul-U.S . 
[ORG FTA  ] proposal . 
[PER Arslanian  ] reiterated [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] opposition to the idea of the [ORG GOB  ] accepting any [ORG IPR  ] enforcement commitments in the context of the [MISC FTAA.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Comment . 
While [PER Dirceu  ] , s statements are certainly welcome , as noted above they are subject to interpretation . 
For instance , notwithstanding his general comments , [PER Dirceu  ] did not make any mention of [ORG GOB  ] flexibility on issues at the heart of the current impasse on [ORG FTAA  ] . 
In addition , [PER Dirceu  ] , s emphasis on market access was consistent with [PER Arslanian  ] , s statements that the [ORG GOB  ] had not given up on its 4 1 market access proposal . 
Also unclear is the timing of any possible [PER Dirceu  ] intervention into the [ORG GOB  ] decisionmaking process ( i.e. , before or after the scheduled May 12 U.S.-Brazil Co-chair meeting ) and whether [PER Dirceu  ] ( or [PER Dirceu  ] and [PER Palocci  ] together ) could make the President and [PER ForMin Amorim  ] budge on [ORG FTAA  ] . 
Indeed , [PER Lula  ] was recently quoted in the overseas press as follows: & ( On the subject of the [ORG FTAA  ] ) , the [LOC United States  ] only wants to negotiate on matters that serve its interests , such as services . 
It does not want to negotiate on matters that are in our interests , such as agricultural produce . 
. . . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is a key negotiator in the [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations , and we will continue to negotiate as long as it takes to achieve what is required. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Finally , Ambassador raised with [PER Dirceu  ] the [ORG USG  ] 's concern that the [ORG GOB  ] might break off negotiations with [LOC U.S.  ] pharmaceutical companies and seek compulsory licenses for these firms' HIV/AIDs antiretroviral drugs . 
[PER Dirceu  ] noted that he planned to raise this issue with Health Minister [PER Costa  ] on April 19 , and that whatever decision the [ORG GOB  ] took would come from President [PER Lula  ] himself . 
[PER Dirceu  ] pointed out that the [ORG GOB  ] found itself in a difficult situation given the rising cost of anti-AIDS pharmaceuticals and its desire to keep its world-class [MISC AIDS  ] treatment program going . 
Nevertheless , he concluded , prior to coming to any final decision , the [ORG GOB  ] would be in touch with the [ORG USG  ] to hear our views .
