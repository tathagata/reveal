( S ) SUMMARY: During a December 12 meeting with Ambassador [PER Arnall  ] , [MISC Dutch  ] Prime Minister [PER Jan Pieter Balkenende  ] expressed satisfaction with his party 's strong performance in the November elections , and predicted a centrist-coalition government could be in place by February . 
According to [PER Balkenende  ] , the [MISC Dutch  ] two-year commitment to [ORG Uruzgan  ] will not be affected by ongoing coalition negotiations , and will be honored by the next government . 
Having raised [MISC Dutch  ] concerns with [MISC Iranian  ] Foreign Minister [PER Mottaki  ] on December 7 , [PER Balkenende  ] expressed irritation with the [MISC Iranian  ] 's " " diplomatic speech " " and his " " unacceptable " " comments on the Holocaust . 
Separately , [PER Balkenende  ] 's senior foreign policy advisor confirmed that the Prime Minister is directly engaged in trying to resolve [ORG Shell  ] 's ongoing dispute with the [MISC Russian  ] government over [LOC Sakhalin  ] , and claimed the [MISC Russians  ] are " " trying to squeeze us like a lemon . 
" " Despite the uncertainty about the next government , [PER Balkenende  ] appeared comfortable with the current situation , optimistic about the future , and confident in his leadership role . 
END SUMMARY . 
CENTRIST GOVERNMENT BY FEBRUARY ? -------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Arnall  ] complemented the Prime Minister on his successful election campaign . 
[PER Balkenende  ] acknowledged that he had -- once again -- defied expectations by leading the [MISC Christian Democrats  ] ( [ORG CDA  ] ) to remain the largest party in [LOC Parliament  ] , when " " six months ago , everyone expected the next Prime Minister to be [PER Wouter Bos  ] " " ( head of the opposition [ORG Labor Party  ] , or [ORG PvdA  ] ) . 
The recent elections had overturned many assumptions about [MISC Dutch  ] politics ; the [ORG CDA  ] , for example , had done better than usual among young voters and in urban areas than in the past . 
Unfortunately , however , the electorate 's unexpected swing to the extreme right -- [PER Geert Wilders' Freedom Party  ] ( [ORG PVV  ] ) and extreme left -- [PER Jan Marijnissen  ] 's [ORG Socialist Party  ] ( [ORG SP  ] ) -- was now complicating the process of forming a coalition . 
[PER Balkenende  ] 's preferred coalition partner -- the conservative [ORG Liberal Party  ] ( [ORG VVD  ] ) -- had run a bad campaign and suffered from internal power struggles , so was no longer in the running. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Balkenende  ] said he was " " not unhappy " " that attempts to form a coalition with [ORG PvdA  ] and [ORG SP  ] had collapsed , since there was no realistic chance of [ORG CDA  ] and [ORG SP  ] governing together . 
This opened the door to the possibility of a " " centrist " " coalition between [ORG CDA  ] , [ORG PvdA  ] , and one of the smaller parties -- most likely [ORG Christian Union  ] or GreenLeft . 
[PER Balkenende  ] suggested that such a coalition could be in place by February , although this would depend on how long it took for [PER Wouter Bos  ] to convince his membership to support such a coalition ; the process could conceivably drag on past the provincial elections in March . 
Although he clearly felt that it was up to the [ORG PvdA  ] to make most of the concessions necessary to join a coalition government , [PER Balkenende  ] acknowledged that the [ORG SP  ] 's surprisingly strong showing posed a real dilemma for the [ORG PvdA  ] leadership , since they now faced a serious challenger on their left flank . 
[LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] COMMITMENT REMAINS FIRM ----------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Arnall  ] asked [PER Balkenende  ] how the coalition negotiations might impact the [MISC Dutch  ] deployment to [ORG Uruzgan  ] . 
[PER Balkenende  ] responded emphatically that it would be " " impossible " " for a future government to renege on the two-year [MISC Dutch  ] commitment to the region . 
The fact that [ORG SP  ] wanted to withdraw [MISC Dutch  ] forces sooner , he added , was one reason why the [ORG CDA  ] could not join them in a coalition government . 
[ORG PvdA  ] , he said , had the same view as the [ORG CDA  ] in this regard , as they had supported the original decision to deploy troops for two years. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Turning to the [LOC Riga  ] summit , [PER Balkenende  ] said that he was generally pleased that [ORG NATO  ] had sent a strong signal of support for the [MISC Afghan  ] mission . 
The willingness of some countries , such as [LOC Norway  ] and [LOC Poland  ] , to increase their contributions was also encouraging . 
On the other hand , [PER Balkenende  ] expressed concern about [MISC Canadian  ] Prime Minister [PER Harper  ] 's domestic political situation and its possible impact on the [MISC Canadian  ] deployment to the south . 
He noted that he had also had intense discussions with [MISC German  ] Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] , who had made clear that [MISC German  ] forces would be available to THE HAGUE 00002597 002 OF 002 support others in extremis . 
" " STRANGE " " MESSAGE FROM [MISC IRANIAN  ] FOREIGN MINISTER --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Balkenende  ] described his short December 7 meeting with visiting [MISC Iranian  ] Foreign Minister [PER Mottaki  ] as " " strange . 
" " He had raised [LOC Iran  ] 's destabilizing role in the region , support for terrorism , human rights violations , and nuclear ambitions . 
On the latter , [PER Balkenende  ] stressed that [LOC Iran  ] must comply with its [ORG IAEA  ] obligations if it is serious about negotiating a positive outcome to the current situation . 
[PER Mottaki  ] , according to [PER Balkenende  ] , had responded with non-substantive " " diplomatic speech . 
" " More disturbingly , in their discussion on the [LOC Middle East  ] , [PER Mottaki  ] had made comments on the Holocaust which [PER Balkenende  ] found " " irritating , " " " " terrible , " " and " " absolutely unacceptable . 
" " Although the [LOC Netherlands  ] has a good economic dialogue with [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Balkenende  ] concluded , he had sent a " " very clear " " message about [MISC Dutch  ] concerns . 
SAKHALIN-SHELL: [MISC RUSSIANS  ] " " SQUEEZING US LIKE A LEMON " " --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) As Ambassador [PER Arnall  ] was leaving [PER Balkenende  ] 's office , [PER Karel van Oosterom  ] -- [PER Balkenende  ] 's senior foreign policy and defense advisor -- confided that [PER Balkenende  ] was following closely [ORG Shell  ] 's ongoing dispute with the [MISC Russian  ] government over [LOC Sakhalin  ] . 
[PER Van Oosterom  ] dismissed recent press reports claiming the issue was settled , saying their release was just a [MISC Russian  ] negotiating tactic . 
[ORG Shell  ] , he stressed , has not agreed to any settlement ; on the contrary , the chairman of [ORG Shell  ] had visited van [PER Oosterom  ] that day to complain that the [MISC Russians  ] had given him " " an offer he couldn't refuse . 
" " [PER Van Oosterom  ] -- who served in [LOC China  ] previously -- joked that , while the [MISC Chinese  ] could " " threaten with a straight face , " " the [MISC Russians  ] " " laugh when they give an ultimatum -- then tell you what they really want . 
" " He reiterated that the [MISC Dutch  ] were not impressed with the " " mafia-style " " [MISC Russian  ] approach and understood that [LOC Russia  ] wanted to " " squeeze [ORG Shell  ] like a lemon . 
" " On the other hand , [LOC Russia  ] was in a much stronger position now than when the original deal was signed , and knew it . 
[PER Van Oosterom  ] did not speculate on what next steps might be , but stated that [ORG Shell  ] and the Prime Minister were now " " studying " " the [MISC Russian  ] proposal . 
COMMENT: -------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Balkenende  ] joked at the start of the conversation that he is currently holding three jobs -- Prime Minister , [ORG CDA  ] faction leader in [LOC Parliament  ] , and chief [ORG CDA  ] negotiator in the coalition talks . 
If this situation is causing him stress , however , he did not let it show during the meeting . 
On the contrary , [PER Balkenende  ] was clearly in command of his portfolio and seemed positively invigorated by the challenges before him . 
He also obviously relishes the prospect of heading the next [MISC Dutch  ] government -- which would be his fourth in as many years . 
Once dismissed as a " " [PER Harry Potter  ] " " clone with no charisma , [PER Balkenende  ] has made a career out of defying expectations -- and appears , once again , to have proven his doubters wrong .
