( C ) In a February 3 conversation with the Ambassador , presidential foreign policy advisor [PER Jovan Ratkovic  ] conveyed [MISC Serbia’s  ] desire for intensified cooperation with the [LOC United States  ] and detailed his plans to visit [LOC Washington  ] February 10-12 to discuss possible ways forward on [LOC Kosovo  ] , saying [LOC Serbia  ] sought a “realistic , pragmatic , peaceful , win-win solution” for [MISC Serbs  ] and [MISC Albanians  ] . 
He expressed concern that the [ORG International Civilian Office  ] ( [ORG ICO  ] ) plan to integrate northern [LOC Kosovo  ] could destabilize the situation and threaten political stability in [LOC Serbia  ] , and would not engage on the issue of whether [LOC Serbia  ] would seek an [ORG UNGA  ] resolution calling for new status talks . 
[PER Ratkovic  ] noted the important role that [ORG KFOR  ] played in [LOC Kosovo  ] and said that [LOC Serbia  ] would formally open its [ORG NATO  ] mission by mid-2010 and increase its participation in [LOC Partnership  ] for Peace activities . 
Progress toward [ORG EU  ] membership would likely be slowed by [ORG EU  ] enlargement fatigue and wariness of accepting new members until they were fully qualified , he predicted . 
[PER Ratkovic  ] expressed cautious optimism that a breakthrough in bilateral relations with [LOC Croatia  ] would be possible , concern about Macedonia’s long-term stability , and disappointment with the poor state of relations with [LOC Montenegro  ] . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ambassador paid an introductory courtesy call on presidential foreign policy advisor [PER Jovan Ratkovic  ] on February 3 . 
[PER Ratkovic  ] was accompanied by his deputy [PER Aleksandar Knezevic  ] . 
Bilateral Relations ------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ambassador thanked [PER Ratkovic  ] for his help in arranging for her to present her credentials to President [PER Tadic  ] so soon after arrival ( Ref B ) , which had allowed her to get off to a quick start in meeting [MISC Serbian  ] government officials . 
She told [PER Ratkovic  ] that she would work to build on the already-strong momentum of the bilateral relationship by expanding our cooperation on economic and security issues , while addressing difficult issues in a constructive way . 
The visits of [PER Codel Voinovich  ] , [PER Codel Pomeroy  ] , and [ORG EUR DAS Jones  ] in February would be important opportunities for dialogue , she noted . 
[PER Ratkovic  ] said that [PER Senator Voinovich  ] was an old friend who was always welcome in [LOC Serbia  ] . 
The fact that he and [PER Senator Shaheen  ] would be arriving on February 17 after having visited [LOC Pristina  ] on the anniversary of [MISC Kosovo’s  ] declaration of independence was problematic , however ; [PER Ratkovic  ] was unable to confirm whether President [PER Tadic  ] would meet with the congressional delegation pending resolution of these itinerary concerns. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) [PER Ratkovic  ] expressed the hope that 2010 would be a “decisive” year for building bilateral relations in which the [LOC United States  ] would treat [LOC Serbia  ] as a true partner in all areas of cooperation , not just security . 
[LOC Serbia  ] intended to continue its cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] on sensitive intelligence matters and to increase defense cooperation by working on peacekeeping training with the [ORG Ohio National Guard  ] . 
[LOC Multilaterally  ] , [LOC Serbia  ] had committed to sending up to 50 additional gendarmerie to [LOC UNMISTAH  ] in [LOC Haiti  ] under [ORG EU  ] auspices and was in discussions with [LOC Spain  ] about contributing troops to [ORG UNIFIL  ] in [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
[LOC BELGRADE  ] 00000025 002 OF 005 Brainstorming on [LOC Kosovo  ] ----------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Ratkovic  ] informed the Ambassador that he would visit [LOC Washington  ] from February 10-12 , after attending [LOC Wehrkunde  ] in [LOC Munich  ] and a [ORG Conservative Party  ] event in [LOC London  ] . 
He hoped to meet with [PER A/S Gordon  ] , as well as contacts in [LOC Congress  ] , for “discreet brainstorming” on ways forward on [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
The Ambassador conveyed [LOC U.S.  ] concerns ( Ref B ) about indications that [LOC Serbia  ] would continue to take a confrontational approach on [LOC Kosovo  ] after the [ORG ICJ  ] rendered its advisory opinion . 
Dismissing the question of whether [LOC Serbia  ] would seek an [ORG UNGA  ] resolution calling for new status talks as a “mere tactical issue” for the MFA to decide , [PER Ratkovic  ] said the Presidency was focused on the bigger question of how to achieve a “realistic , pragmatic , peaceful , win-win solution” for [MISC Serbs  ] and [MISC Albanians  ] . 
[PER Ratkovic  ] said that [LOC Serbia  ] recognized and was trying to respect the “legitimate interests” of Kosovar [MISC Albanians  ] ; in return , [LOC Serbia  ] expected the Kosovars to respect the legitimate interests of [LOC Serbia  ] and [LOC Kosovo  ] [MISC Serbs  ] as well . 
He stressed that the [MISC Serbian  ] government wanted the [LOC U.S.  ] to be part of and support a solution that would lead to regional stability and reconciliation . 
For that reason , he hoped for high-level , free-thinking , and informal discussions in [LOC Washington  ] ; he had received explicit guidance from President [PER Tadic  ] on the specifics of his message , but was not at liberty to share it yet. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Ratkovic  ] returned to the topic of [LOC Kosovo  ] later in the conversation , stressing the sensitivity of how the north is handled . 
[PER Ratkovic  ] argued that the northern part of [LOC Kosovo  ] had a history distinct from the rest of the province , claiming that the three districts north of the [LOC Ibar  ] were only annexed to the province after [MISC World War II  ] to counter-balance the rapid growth of the ethnic [MISC Albanian  ] population. “These people have never lived with [MISC Albanians  ] , have never felt themselves part of [LOC Kosovo  ] , and won’t accept rule by [LOC Pristina  ] , ” [PER Ratkovic  ] said. “Belgrade is not trying to change the reality on the ground for Kosovar [MISC Albanians  ] , but changing the reality for [LOC Kosovo  ] [MISC Serbs  ] would also be destabilizing , ” he added . 
For that reason the [ORG ICO  ] proposal to integrate the north put forward by [PER Peter Feith  ] and supported by the [LOC United States  ] was “not helpful , ” according to [PER Ratkovic  ] , who claimed that military intervention was being discussed . 
He said that this was the primary reason that [PER Tadic  ] decided to address the [ORG UN Security Council  ] on January 22: the implementation of such a strategy could result in instability and thus become a national security concern for [LOC Serbia  ] , threatening the country’s democratization and pro-Western orientation . 
( Comment: [MISC Serbia’s  ] historical arguments are routinely countered by [MISC Albanian  ] historical recollections to the contrary . 
Ratkovic’s claims of a separate historical “reality” for [LOC Northern Mitrovica  ] , therefore , would find resistance from [LOC Kosovo  ] [MISC Albanian  ] historians . 
End Comment . 
) <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The Ambassador responded that the ideas put forward by [PER Feith  ] were not new ; the integration of northern [LOC Kosovo  ] had always been on the table . 
She emphasized that there was no discussion of the use of force to impose the integration of the whole territory of [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
Noting that we understand the [MISC Serbian  ] government’s sensitivities , the Ambassador underscored the need to exchange views openly on the full range of unresolved issues and encouraged [PER Ratkovic  ] to share his thinking in detail while in [LOC Washington  ] . 
[PER Ratkovic  ] said that [LOC Serbia  ] had the EU’s assurances that the document produced by the [ORG ICO  ] was not an [ORG EU  ] plan . 
He added that given the situation on the ground and the attitude of [LOC Kosovo  ] [MISC Serbs  ] toward the [ORG ICO  ] , the only way to implement the plan would be by use of force . 
[LOC BELGRADE  ] 00000025 003 OF 005 [ORG NATO  ] Relations -------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Asked about the [MISC President’s  ] views on [MISC Serbia’s  ] relations with [ORG NATO  ] , [PER Ratkovic  ] said that as a former Minister of [LOC Defense  ] , President [PER Tadic  ] knows the issue well . 
[PER Tadic  ] believes that [LOC Serbia  ] cannot remain outside of [ORG NATO  ] forever , but doesn’t say this often because of the political sensitivity of the issue . 
[PER Ratkovic  ] explained that after the fall of the [LOC Berlin Wall  ] , the citizens of [LOC Yugoslavia  ] assumed that they would be among the first to enter both the [ORG European Union  ] and [ORG NATO  ] . 
It wasn’t until the wars of the [PER Milosevic  ] era and the 1999 [ORG NATO  ] intervention that anti-NATO sentiment developed in [LOC Serbia  ] . 
[PER Ratkovic  ] characterized current public support for [LOC PfP  ] participation and [ORG NATO  ] membership as “surprisingly high” given [MISC Serbia’s  ] history. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [LOC Serbia  ] is taking concrete steps to increase its engagement with [ORG NATO  ] , [PER Ratkovic  ] said . 
It has appointed an ambassador to [ORG NATO  ] and established a mission there ; once the office is fully operational , President [PER Tadic  ] will travel to [LOC Brussels  ] in June or July to open it formally and hopes to address the [ORG North Atlantic Council  ] . 
[PER Tadic  ] had instructed the MFA and the MOD to increase [MISC Serbia’s  ] participation in [LOC PfP  ] “on the model of [MISC Austria.” These  ] steps needed to precede any decision about membership , [PER Ratkovic  ] said . 
He added that President [PER Tadic  ] would meet with [ORG SACEUR/EUCOM CDR ADM  ] [PER James Stavridis  ] in [LOC Belgrade  ] on February 11 . 
[PER Ratkovic  ] emphasized that [MISC NATO’s  ] image in the [MISC Serbian  ] public had a significant influence on the development of the relationship , mentioning the role of [ORG KFOR  ] in protecting [MISC Kosovo Serbs  ] and religious sites and concerns about its drawdown . 
[ORG European Integration  ] --------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Ratkovic  ] predicted that the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG EU  ] presidency would push for movement on [MISC Serbia’s  ] [ORG EU  ] membership application in March but did not know whether the effort would be successful , due to member-states’ enlargement fatigue and wariness of accepting any more new members that were not fully qualified . 
He charged that Germany’s misguided belief that enlargement was economically detrimental rather than beneficial had led it to introduce new hurdles for applicants , including making the forwarding of a membership application to the [ORG Commission  ] for an avis a political rather than a technical question . 
He asserted that both [LOC Serbia  ] and [LOC Croatia  ] had the administrative capacity and political will to fulfill all [ORG EU  ] criteria , noting that the upcoming tenth anniversary of the October 5 , 2000 , overthrow of [PER Milosevic  ] would provide an opportunity to remind the world of the results of [MISC Serbia’s  ] “democratic revolution.” [MISC Regional Relations  ] ------------------ <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The Ambassador told [PER Ratkovic  ] that the [LOC United States  ] was supportive of [MISC Serbia’s  ] efforts to improve its relations with [LOC Croatia  ] and informed him that PRM DAS [PER David Robinson  ] would visit [LOC Belgrade  ] in early March to look at how the [LOC United States  ] could contribute to resolving protracted refugee issues , particularly [LOC BELGRADE  ] 00000025 004 OF 005 between [LOC Serbia  ] and [LOC Croatia  ] . 
[PER Ratkovic  ] said that the presidency was working discreetly with [LOC Croatia  ] on a “roadmap” to resolve all of the outstanding bilateral issues , and that they understood the [ORG EU  ] had sent a helpful message to [LOC Zagreb  ] that [LOC Croatia  ] needed to find solutions in order to close Chapter 23 of the acquis . 
He said he was cautiously optimistic that there would be a breakthrough with [LOC Croatia  ] in 2010. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Ratkovic  ] expressed pessimism about prospects for constitutional reform in [LOC Bosnia-Herzegovina  ] in light of upcoming elections . 
He said the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG EU  ] presidency would make a last attempt to reach agreement before the election campaign began in earnest but would face difficult odds . 
[PER Ratkovic  ] reiterated that the [MISC Serbian  ] government supported the territorial integrity of [LOC BiH  ] and would not be swayed by what he claimed was the desire of the majority of [LOC Republika Srpska  ] residents to secede and merge with [LOC Serbia  ] . 
In this context , [LOC Serbia  ] also supported BiH’s entry into [ORG EU  ] and [ORG NATO  ] as a way to stabilize the country and cement the current borders . 
[PER Ratkovic  ] said the [ORG USG  ] had miscalculated in making constitutional reform a pre-condition for a [ORG NATO  ] Membership [MISC Action Plan  ] status for [LOC BiH  ] , as most [MISC Bosnian Serbs  ] were not for [ORG NATO  ] . 
He expressed regret that the [LOC Butmir  ] process had not produced agreement since many of the elements of the plan were acceptable to all three constituent peoples ; it would have been better to avoid taking an “all or nothing” approach to the reforms and to have granted MAP status , he judged. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [LOC Serbia  ] is more worried about Macedonia’s future than Bosnia’s , [PER Ratkovic  ] said . 
It is not clear how a country composed of two completely different ethnic groups with no common language or religion can hold together , he commented , particularly with the ethnic [MISC Albanian  ] population growing at such as rate that it will equal the [MISC Slavic  ] population in 20 years . 
[PER Ratkovic  ] said that President [PER Tadic  ] was talking to both [LOC Greece  ] and [LOC Macedonia  ] about the name issue in hopes of unblocking Macedonia’s path to both the [ORG EU  ] and [ORG NATO.  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [MISC Serbia’s  ] relations with [LOC Montenegro  ] were at a historic low , [PER Ratkovic  ] said , noting that as he and [PER Tadic  ] were both of [MISC Montenegrin  ] origin they felt the situation keenly . 
He explained that the [MISC Montenegrin  ] government had had to distance itself from [LOC Belgrade  ] in order to win the independence referendum , but as there were no longer any divisive issues the ball was in Podgorica’s court . 
It remained to be seen if [LOC Montenegro  ] would treat [LOC Serbia  ] as “a strategic partner or a bogeyman , ” [PER Ratkovic  ] commented . 
One important criterion will be how [LOC Montenegro  ] addresses organized crime , which [PER Ratkovic  ] identified as a serious problem that [LOC Serbia  ] believed must be tackled . 
Comment ------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) As [MISC Tadic’s  ] foreign policy advisor , Ratkovic’s comments come closest to reflecting the President’s views and vision on issues across the spectrum . 
His decision to visit [LOC Washington  ] next week , under clear instruction , to outline [MISC Tadic’s  ] thinking in a low-key manner on a post-ICJ way forward is a constructive step and may provide an important opportunity to influence Belgrade’s strategy . 
In a meeting with the [LOC UK  ] ambassador ( please protect ) earlier this week , [PER Ratkovic  ] outlined the following ideas that likely reflect current thinking: Option A: some understanding of a bigger [MISC Serbian  ] role in the north and over five monasteries in the south , in which case [LOC Belgrade  ] would “accept” but not recognize [LOC BELGRADE  ] 00000025 005 OF 005 [LOC Kosovo  ] ; Option B: Partition ; Option C: [LOC Serbia  ] chooses between [LOC Kosovo  ] or the [ORG EU  ] . 
Option A ( i.e , finding a way to define [MISC Serbia’s  ] special interests in the north and with the status of some churches in the south ) most likely reflects the ideas that [LOC Belgrade  ] is most interested in exploring . 
While [MISC Serbia’s  ] lack of a commitment to recognize [LOC Kosovo  ] will remain an [ORG EU  ] stumbling in the long-term , Ratkovic’s overture next week may provide an initial first step toward defining a more realistic modus vivendi , which we have been encouraging the [MISC Serbs  ] to explore. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [PER Ratkovic  ] understands that the ideas he outlines next week will only provide a basis for discussion , with the expectation , of course , of much more work to follow . 
Nevertheless , we are encouraged by what appears to be a growing recognition of both the strategic and tactical importance of opening channels for a post-ICJ dialogue sooner rather than later , and the need to manage next steps in a way that does not undermine other key [LOC Belgrade  ] objectives , above all eventual [ORG EU  ] accession . 
FM Jeremic’s visit to [LOC Washington  ] the week of February 22 and DAS Jones’s travel to the region the same week will provide important follow-on opportunities for continued engagement on the way ahead .
