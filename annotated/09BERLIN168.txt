( C ) SUMMARY . 
The sudden resignation of Economics Minister [PER Michael Glos  ] ( [ORG CSU  ] ) on February 7 caught Chancellor [PER Angela Merkel  ] ( [ORG CDU  ] ) and her party off guard at a time when addressing [LOC Germany  ] 's economic downturn is paramount . 
To minimize damage , the [ORG CSU  ] quickly replaced [PER Glos  ] with its Secretary General Karl-Theodor zu [PER Guttenberg  ] , a decision which continues to draw criticism from other parties as well as from within the [ORG CDU  ] due to thirty-seven-year-old , s minimal background in economic policy . 
The shuffle reveals strains between the [ORG CDU  ] and [ORG CSU  ] , and presents an opportunity for [PER Merkel  ] 's political foes to portray her as lacking control as the country tries to deal with its worst economic crisis since [MISC World War II  ] . 
END SUMMARY . 
INITIAL CONFUSION OVER RESIGNATION ---------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Citing his age and intention to leave the cabinet after the September 2009 elections , the sixty-four-year-old [PER Glos  ] submitted his resignation as Minister for Economics and Technology on February 7 . 
Chairman of the [ORG Christian Social Union  ] ( [ORG CSU  ] ) , the [MISC Bavarian  ] sister party of Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] 's [ORG Christian Democratic Union  ] ( [ORG CDU  ] ) , and [MISC Bavarian  ] Minister President [PER Horst Seehofer  ] named Karl-Theodor zu [PER Guttenberg  ] , 37 , as his successor . 
Zu [PER Guttenberg  ] had been [ORG CSU  ] Secretary General for only three months following a major party reshuffle . 
[PER Glos  ] explained his departure would allow the [ORG CSU  ] to campaign with a new minister in place , and help restore trust in the [ORG CSU  ] following its poor showing in the [MISC Bavarian  ] regional elections in September 2008 . 
The timing of his departure -- during the financial and economic crises -- however , was awkward . 
In addition , [PER Glos  ] submitted his resignation to [PER Seehofer  ] instead of [PER Merkel  ] , which the media has portrayed as a snub to the Chancellor . 
( NOTE: [MISC Bavarian  ] political reactions to be reported in [ORG ConGen Munich SEPTEL  ] . 
) ENTER THE YOUNG TURK -------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Under pressure to resolve an apparent power vacuum at a key ministry , [PER Seehofer  ] , who as [ORG CSU Party  ] Chairman had the right to fill the slot , had to find a replacement for [PER Glos  ] quickly . 
At a February 9 press conference announcing the choice of zu [PER Guttenberg  ] , [PER Seehofer  ] said that he chose the rising [ORG CSU  ] star partly in order to have a minister representing the northern region of [LOC Bavaria  ] . 
He lauded zu [PER Guttenberg  ] 's international contacts and his presumed ability to promote [MISC German  ] exports . 
[PER Seehofer  ] denied reports that before accepting the new post , zu [PER Guttenberg  ] had demanded the high-level position of [ORG CSU Bundestag Spokesman  ] and [ORG CDU/CSU Caucus  ] Chief in case the [ORG CDU/CSU  ] lost the September elections . 
For his part , zu [PER Guttenberg  ] welcomed the opportunity to take on the economics portfolio . 
He described [LOC Germany  ] 's " social market economy " as the " guiding principle " of his economic thinking , and underscored the importance of free trade . 
Zu [PER Guttenberg  ] also said he would work to lower taxes for small- and medium-sized companies . 
GLOS'S ROUGH RIDE ----------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Glos  ] had always been an awkward fit for the [ORG Economics Ministry  ] job , which he took on in November 2005 . 
[PER Glos  ] did bring intimate knowledge of federal politics to the job , but was not an economist and had never shown strong interest in the [ORG Economics Ministry  ] 's portfolio . 
Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] instinctively turned to her Finance Minister [PER Peer Steinbrueck  ] ( [ORG SPD  ] ) to coordinate the response to the financial crisis , sidelining [PER Glos  ] . 
[PER Glos  ] 's inability to overcome [ORG CDU  ] and [ORG SPD  ] objectives and get additional tax cuts into the stimulus plan may have cost the [ORG CSU  ] the recent [MISC Bavarian  ] elections , to the dismay of [PER Seehofer  ] and others in the [LOC CSU.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) A devastating profile of [PER Glos  ] a few months ago in " [PER Der Spiegel  ] , " whose main points Ministry contacts did not contadict , portrayed him as weak , out of touch with the bureaucracy , bored with his job , and looking forward to a nice sinecure for himself after retirement . 
In a farewell [LOC BERLIN  ] 00000168 002.2 OF 002 meeting with former Ambassador [PER Timken  ] in late November 2008 , [PER Glos  ] appeared under great strain and confessed to tremendous frustration over his inability to influence [PER Merkel  ] on tax cuts as part of the stimulus package . 
NO LOVE LOST ------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG SPD  ] party stalwarts are giddy over perceived turmoil in the [ORG CSU  ] and the perception that [PER Merkel  ] is not in control of developments . 
Chancellor-candidate [PER Frank-Walter Steinmeier  ] ( [ORG SPD  ] ) said the [ORG CDU/CSU  ] lacked " orientation " in their management of the economic crisis and called for " party order and discipline . 
" A [ORG CDU  ] staffer expressed irritation over [PER Seehofer  ] 's handling of the shuffle , but she shed no tears over [PER Glos  ] 's departure . 
On zu [PER Guttenberg  ] , [ORG FDP  ] economics expert [PER Rainer Bruederle  ] commented to us that " as far as economics is concerned , it seems to be enough these days for the [ORG CSU  ] to find someone who can read and write . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The business community has mixed views . 
An [ORG IBM  ] lobbyist told Econoff that she regarded [PER Glos  ] as the only " counterweight to [PER Steinbrueck  ] " on economic policymaking in the [LOC Germany  ] government . 
A contact from the [MISC German  ] industry association ( [ORG BDI  ] ) conceded that [PER Glos  ] was " not the strongest Minister in the Cabinet , " adding that [ORG BDI  ] had often wished for someone in the position who was " more outspoken . 
" On zu [PER Guttenberg  ] , he conceded the new Minister was well-versed in foreign policy and transatlantic issues , though young and inexperienced . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Glos  ] 's resignation caught the [ORG CDU/CSU  ] party hierarchy off-guard at a time when everyone in [LOC Berlin  ] and [LOC Munich  ] was concentrating on the [ORG Munich Security Conference  ] . 
This high-profile resignation opens the door to criticism of [PER Merkel  ] , s handling of the economic and financial crises , as well as [PER Seehofer  ] 's leadership style . 
Zu [PER Guttenberg  ] 's first challenge will be to help resolve the debate between the [ORG CDU/CSU  ] and [ORG SPD  ] over the stimulus package . 
His appointment has been heavily criticized within the [ORG CDU  ] , with some calling him a mere " place holder " until the September elections , raising questions about [PER Merkel  ] , s ability to steer her party effectively through a long &super8 election year . 
If not addressed , the [ORG SPD  ] and the opposition [ORG FDP  ] could emerge strengthened by the affair , which has come at a very inopportune time for Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] , s [ORG CDU  ] and its sister party , the [ORG CSU  ] . 
END COMMENT. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 .
