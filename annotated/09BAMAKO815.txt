Milovanovic  ] , for reasons 1.4 ( b ) ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) On December 11 the [ORG DCM  ] and [ORG DATT  ] participated in the graduation ceremony of a [ORG Joint Combined Exchange Training  ] ( [ORG JCET  ] ) exercise of the [MISC Malian  ] [ORG Army Echelon Tactique Interarme  ] ( [ORG ETIA  ] ) 4 , in [LOC Gao  ] . 
[ORG ETIA  ] 4 is based in [LOC Timbuktu  ] . 
The [ORG 10th Army Special Forces Group  ] out of [LOC Fort Carson  ] , [LOC Colorado  ] , and led by Captain [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and Master Sergeant [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , conducted the [ORG JCET  ] . 
Overall , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the approximately 160 men learned a lot over the five week training exercise . 
The exercise was shorter than planned in the wake of a hostage taking incident in [LOC Mali  ] which led to a change in [LOC THREATCON  ] and the [LOC US  ] military-ordered temporary suspension of training while the [ORG JCET  ] team was temporarily restricted to its quarters. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The Governor of [LOC Gao  ] region , Colonel [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , presided over the [ORG JCET  ] graduation and thanked the [ORG U.S. Government  ] for its commitment to helping [LOC Mali  ] defend itself . 
Noting that he had served as military commander of the [LOC Timbuktu  ] region during the time of the [MISC Tuareg  ] rebellion , he exhorted [ORG ETIA  ] 4 to apply what it had learned in the course of the training . 
A product of numerous [ORG IMET  ] training opportunities in the [LOC United States  ] and recently returned from a five year tour in [LOC Addis Ababa  ] as [LOC Mali  ] , s military attach , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] displayed an unfortunate lack of respect for the common soldiers who are being asked to lead the fight against [ORG AQIM  ] . 
He distractedly waved on the many troops who stood at attention before him after receiving their graduation certificates , leaving the [ORG DATT  ] to return their salutes. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) When the [ORG DCM  ] asked him about the security situation in [LOC Gao  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he viewed the kidnapping of [MISC French  ] citizen [PER Pierre Cammatte  ] as a worrisome escalation , as [ORG AQIM  ] had until now refrained from taking hostages on [MISC Malian  ] soil . 
Nevertheless , he minimized the risk , saying that although many had left , there were still quite a few [MISC French  ] and other [MISC European  ] nationals working in [LOC Gao Region  ] . 
He did not reiterate his September 23 request to the Ambassador for more development assistance. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) After the ceremony [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] called over one , rather unimpressive soldier , an older , rail thin man with a scraggly beard and bloodshot eyes who had been lounging against a motorbike in a dirty [MISC T-shirt  ] inside of a warehouse . 
He explained that in spite of appearances , this was one of the [ORG ETIA  ] 's best men , noting that he had been one of the few survivors of a July 4 ambush of a [MISC Malian  ] [ORG Army  ] patrol by [ORG Al Qaida  ] in the [LOC Islamic Maghreb  ] ( see [ORG IIR  ] 6 958 0087 09 ) . 
When asked how the training had gone , the soldier said if he had known at the time of the ambush what he had learned over the course of the [ORG JCET  ] , it never would have happened . 
He cited in particular learning why and how to establish a mobile patrol post , digging and manning foxholes which afford 360 degree , round-the-clock protection from potential assailants . 
The soldier said the [MISC Salafists  ] would never confront the [ORG Army  ] head-on , and if the [ORG Army  ] engaged , they would flee , but if there is not proper security , they will creep back and murder you in the most cruel , unimaginable ways . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that the [ORG ETIA  ] had done simulation exercises to defend , for example , the recovery of a broken down vehicle. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The commander of [ORG ETIA  ] 4 , a major , also spoke highly of the training . 
He noted that he had already reached the end of his six month rotation , but had been extended so as to be able to lead participation in the [ORG JCET  ] . 
He said he does not want to leave his men , and spoke about the logic of having a longer tour so as to develop skills over time and to build on training rather than starting from the beginning each time there is an opportunity for a [ORG JCET  ] or other training . 
Nevertheless , it was evident from the preponderant number of black [MISC African  ] faces in the ranks that most of [ORG ETIA  ] 4 was not from the [LOC North  ] , and service in the [LOC North  ] will clearly be a significant hardship on them and their families , most of whom live in the [MISC South.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that each soldier had expended some 1,000 rounds of ammunition during the course of the training . 
Although a [ORG U.S. Special Forces  ] soldier might expend that much in a day of training , he noted that a number of the [MISC Malian  ] soldiers said it was probably more than they had used in their entire careers . 
He said the [ORG JCET  ] had revealed , and made an effort to correct , some simple lacunae . 
For example , when the survivors of the July 4 ambush were asked why they had left behind so many vehicles to be captured by [ORG AQIM  ] , they said the drivers had been killed and no one else in the unit knew how to drive . 
When asked why they had not used a heavy machine gun , they answered that the gunner who knew how to operate the weapon had also been killed , and he was the only one who knew what to do . 
Although it detracted from their initial training objective , the [LOC U.S.  ] trainers taught everyone in the [ORG ETIA  ] to drive and to fire and maintain all of their weapons systems. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) When asked from a non-scientific perspective to rate [ORG ETIA  ] 4 with other comparable army units , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that , based on conversations with the Officer in Charge of the September 2009 training of [ORG ETIA  ] 1 ( [ORG Bamako  ] 538 ) , he believes that [ORG ETIA  ] 4 's capabilities are better overall . 
On a scale of 1 to 10 compared to other forces in [LOC Africa  ] and the [LOC Middle East  ] , including [ORG Iraqi Army  ] regulars , [ORG ETIA  ] 4 ranks about 6 out of 10 . 
This compares to [MISC Algerian  ] [ORG Army  ] regulars that he ranked about 7 or 8 . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that , with maintenance of the skills they had learned during the [ORG JCET  ] and additional , follow-up training , [ORG ETIA  ] 4 could easily improve. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [ORG JCET  ] moved on December 7-8 to [PER Amakouladji  ] , a town approximately 35 kilometers north of [LOC Gao  ] on the road to [LOC Bourem  ] . 
There , they conducted a live fire exercise with rocket-propelled grenades and mortars at a firing range [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said was safe and well-suited to simulate geographic conditions in the [LOC North  ] . 
In the town itself , they distributed supplies to some 240 grateful primary school students and vaccinated 250 farm animals . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and several of his men said they had seen no/no evidence of [ORG AQIM  ] surveillance or activity during the course of the five week [ORG JCET.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) Although the [ORG JCET  ] was an overall success , it was not without problems . 
The 14 Landcruisers designated for [ORG ETIA  ] 4 , that were part of the 37 the Ambassador handed over to the Minister of Defense on October 20 , did not show up in [LOC Gao  ] until the last week of the training . 
While the vehicles , five equipped with [MISC Harris  ] HF radios , are with the unit now , and will move with the [ORG ETIA  ] 4 back to [LOC Timbuktu  ] , the hand held radios that should also have been part of the [ORG ETIA  ] 4 vehicle allocation had not yet arrived . 
Only about two thirds of the 160-strong unit were wearing the boots and desert fatigues provided by the [LOC United States  ] , but additional boots and other equipment arrived on the [MISC CASA 212  ] flight from [LOC Bamako  ] the day of the ceremony . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also said that the [LOC Gao  ] base commander had initially tried to keep him out of a warehouse which stored replacement gun barrels and other parts . 
He was told that the materiel was being held in reserve , but he overcame the base commander 's objections and succeeded in procuring what was needed to replace broken or missing equipment held by the [ORG ETIA  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was asked to make that part of his report , as the Ambassador had raised the problem with President [PER Amadou Toumani Toure  ] in September ( [ORG Bamako  ] 619 ) .
