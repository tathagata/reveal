( S ) SUMMARY . 
In meetings March 8 in The [MISC Hague  ] , senior [ORG GONL  ] officials told visiting Treasury Under Secretary [PER Levey  ] that a nuclear-armed [LOC Iran  ] would be unacceptable . 
While supporting [ORG USG  ] aims for a second [ORG UN  ] resolution on [LOC Iran  ] , these officials stressed the need for practical and non-discriminatory measures . 
[MISC Dutch  ] banks [ORG ING  ] and [ORG ABN Amro  ] asserted that they are fully compliant with [ORG USG  ] regulations , with [ORG ABN Amro  ] reporting that it is in the process of eliminating its business with [LOC Iran  ] in all currencies . 
This message has been cleared by [PER U/S Levey  ] . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence [PER Stuart Levey  ] visited the [LOC Netherlands  ] March 8 for talks on [LOC Iran  ] and [ORG UNSCR  ] 1737 , specifically to encourage an inclusive reading of the resolution and to discuss with the financial sector the risks of doing business with [LOC Iran  ] . 
The following reports on [PER U/S Levey  ] 's discussions with officials from the [ORG Dutch Ministries of Foreign Affairs  ] ( [ORG MFA  ] ) and Finance ( [ORG MOF  ] ) , as well as the management of [MISC Dutch  ] banks [ORG ABN Amro  ] and [ORG ING  ] . 
[PER U/S Levey  ] was accompanied to these meetings by Senior Advisor to [PER U/S Levey Amanda Curtis  ] , Senior Analyst [PER Mike Madon  ] , [ORG State Department  ] ( [ORG NEA  ] ) Deputy Director for [MISC Iranian  ] Affairs [PER Henry Wooster  ] , and Econoff. ------------------------------------------- [PER Levey  ] 's Introductory Message: [LOC Iran  ] a Threat ------------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER U/S Levey  ] told [ORG MFA  ] officials he traveled to the [LOC Middle East  ] to talk with governments about efforts to financially isolate [LOC Iran  ] . 
[LOC Iran  ] was viewed as a real threat in the region , and there was great concern about [LOC Iran  ] 's pursuit of nuclear weapons , he said . 
Most in the region also saw [ORG UNSCR  ] 1737 and reduced investment in [LOC Iran  ] affecting the [MISC Iranian  ] elite , leading to questioning of their government 's policies and harsher criticism of the [MISC Iranian  ] regime in the news . 
[PER U/S Levey  ] said the [ORG USG  ] believed [LOC Iran  ] was surprised that the impact from [ORG UNSCR  ] 1737 was greater than originally thought. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER U/S Levey  ] noted the [ORG USG  ] remains interested in , and countries have to commit to finding , a peaceful solution . 
The [ORG USG  ] is trying to increase awareness of [LOC Iran  ] 's business risks , and [PER U/S Levey  ] noted that many companies are realizing this is not the right time to do business with [LOC Iran.  ] ------------------------------------- [ORG MFA: A Nuclear Iran  ] is Unacceptable ------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Wim Geerts  ] , [ORG MFA  ] Deputy Director General for [ORG Political Affairs  ] , told [PER U/S Levey  ] that a nuclear [LOC Iran  ] was not an option and that a regime that denies the Holocaust cannot be trusted with nuclear weapons . 
[PER Geerts  ] added that while the [LOC Netherlands  ] had changed governments , there would be no softening toward [LOC Iran  ] and that he expected the [ORG MFA  ] to continue its three track approach . 
First , he said , is the effort to maintain pressure on [LOC Iran  ] concerning its support of terror and violations of human rights , support for [ORG UNSCR  ] 1737 , and reaching common ground on a new resolution . 
Second , [PER Geerts  ] advocated dialogue , and noted his pleasure with the [ORG USG  ] participation in the [LOC Iraq  ] security meeting . 
Third , the [ORG MFA  ] intends to continue efforts to advance [MISC Iranian  ] civil society and stimulate media diversity. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) Responding to Geerts' queries about a second [ORG UN Security Council  ] resolution , [PER Wooster  ] said it was important to demystify what the resolution and other diplomatic actions such as financial measures were intended to accomplish , which is to bring the [MISC Iranians  ] back to the negotiating table . 
Thus , the [MISC P5  ] plus 1 package remains on the table. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) [PER Geerts  ] said the proposed elements of a second resolution are clear and make sense , and the [MISC Dutch  ] support efforts at negotiations , citing [LOC North Korea  ] as an example where peaceful pressure can work . 
He said the [ORG MFA  ] would support additional sanctions under four conditions: that they are targeted against institutions to really make a THE [MISC HAGUE  ] 00000566 002 OF 004 difference , and not broadly applied to hurt the [MISC Iranian  ] people , and that they are gradual , proportional , and reversible . 
On specifics , [PER Geerts  ] predicted new [MISC Dutch  ] Foreign Minister [PER Maxime Verhagen  ] would concur with the travel ban . 
He added the [MISC Dutch  ] would support the arms sales ban , financial restrictions , if they are specific , and export credit restrictions , if they are applied collectively . 
On the [ORG Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps  ] ( [ORG IRGC  ] ) , [PER Geerts  ] stressed the importance of keeping [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC China  ] on board and praised [LOC U.S.  ] efforts at doing so. --------------------------------------------- [PER Levey Calls  ] for Broader Reading of [ORG UNSCR  ] 1737 --------------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER U/S Levey  ] called on the [MISC Dutch  ] to take a fair reading of [ORG UNSCR  ] 1737 in two ways . 
First , he encouraged taking action against the [ORG IRGC  ] , whose Chief Commander -- General [PER Safavi  ] -- is designated under the [ORG UNSCR  ] . 
[PER U/S Levey  ] said the [ORG EU  ] should take action against companies controlled by the [ORG IRGC  ] to give [ORG UNSCR  ] 1737 real effect . 
He provided a list to [ORG MFA  ] and [ORG MOF  ] officials . 
[PER U/S Levey  ] encouraged the [ORG GONL  ] to see if banks were aware that these organizations were [MISC IRGC-controlled  ] . 
Second , [PER U/S Levey  ] advocated for a greater focus on [ORG UNSCR  ] 1737 paragraph 6 , which seeks to ensure financial services are not provided to support [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear and missile programs . 
Financial services should be interpreted to include transactions and letters of credit , [PER U/S Levey  ] said , stressing that governments should encourage financial institutions to deny services unless they are sure that the recipient is not aiding [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear or missile programs . 
Furthermore , if any [MISC Iranian  ] entity is found trying to acquire [ORG WMD  ] items , then all financial support should be withheld from that entity , he added. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) In response to [PER U/S Levey  ] 's call for a fair reading of [ORG UNSCR  ] 1737 , [PER Geerts  ] outlined recent [MISC Dutch  ] and [ORG EU  ] efforts . 
The [ORG EU  ] released a [ORG Common Position  ] in February , and he expected implementing regulations to be finalized the week of March 12 . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] , he added , have already implemented national measures , including financial sanctions and a visa policy preventing [MISC Iranians  ] from studying proliferation-sensitive subjects . 
[ORG MFA  ] official [PER Sitte Noland  ] said starting in summer 2006 , the [ORG EU  ] began requiring export licenses for products sold to [LOC Iran  ] that could be used for the [ORG WMD  ] program . 
If there is any doubt that the product will be used for peaceful purposes , the export license is denied and the products held . 
To address re-exports and shipments using secondary routes to avoid detection , the [ORG GONL  ] works with other transit hubs -- such as those in the [LOC UAE  ] and [LOC Malaysia  ] -- to share customs information , she added. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Geerts  ] said he expected Foreign Minister [PER Verhagen  ] to pressure [LOC Iran  ] in the area of human rights , starting with [MISC Iranian  ] Foreign Minister [PER Mottaki  ] at the next [ORG Human Rights Council  ] in [LOC Geneva  ] . 
[PER Verhagen  ] recently extended spending to 15 million euros -- allocated through NGOs -- to support [MISC Iranian  ] civil society and alternative media sources , [PER Geerts  ] said . 
[PER Verhagen  ] will also put [LOC Iran  ] high on the agenda when he meets Secretary Rice on April 2 , he added. ---------------------------------------- [MISC Dutch  ] on [MISC Shell: Keep Playing Field Level  ] ---------------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Geerts  ] told [PER U/S Levey  ] any measures to sanction companies with business ties to [LOC Iran  ] should be comprehensive in order to maintain a level playing field . 
The [ORG GONL  ] maintains regular contact with [ORG Shell  ] , he added , so the company is informed and considers consequences before making a decision. ------------------------------------ [ORG MOF  ] asks for [ORG Practical Iran Measures  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) At a subsequent meeting with [MISC Bernard  ] ter [PER Haar  ] , Deputy Treasurer General and Director of the Financial [ORG Markets Policy Directorate  ] , [PER U/S Levey  ] said the [ORG Wolfsburg Group  ] -- an independent group of major banks advising on financial best practices -- is voluntarily developing THE [MISC HAGUE  ] 00000566 003 OF 004 recommendations regarding the use of cover payments . 
These best practices will include a recommendation that the underlying beneficiary be identified in all transactions . 
[PER U/S Levey  ] said that banks have found that [LOC Iran  ] asks for the underlying data to be stripped off transactions , as a matter of course , and the [LOC Wolfsburg  ] initiative is a private-sector effort to increase the transparency of the international financial system and to protect responsible financial institutions . 
Ter [PER Haar  ] agreed identifying names was important , but said solutions should consider administrative burden and carefully weigh costs and benefits. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER U/S Levey  ] noted that countries should use paragraph 6 of [ORG UNSCR  ] 1737 to take action against entities supporting [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear or missile programs - even if they are not listed in the annex . 
However , the [ORG MOF  ] opined that the paragraph was too vague and that a broader interpretation would require governments to provide specific names and identifiers in order to implement . 
They also suggested that there should be a globally shared definition of broader interpretation . 
[PER U/S Levey  ] suggested issuing an advisory -- at either the national or [ORG EU  ] level -- that encouraged banks to exercise vigilance and to avoid business with questionable entities . 
[PER U/S Levey  ] said an advisory would be a very powerful message . 
He noted that avoiding business is a much less aggressive approach than accepting it and freezing assets later. --------------------------------------------- -------------- [ORG Export Credit Policy: No Transactions Over  ] 25 Million [PER Euros  ] --------------------------------------------- -------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Maarten Masselink  ] , Policy Officer , [ORG International Financial Relations Directorate  ] and responsible for export credits , said the [ORG GONL  ] has a very restrictive policy on [LOC Iran  ] . 
[ORG MOF  ] assesses every [MISC Iran-related  ] transaction , and current policy is to refuse transactions over 25 million euros . 
In the past , [PER Masselink  ] added , the [ORG GONL  ] has provided export credits for harbor dredging equipment , where the [MISC Dutch  ] are global leaders , and a cookie factory . 
[PER U/S Levey  ] welcomed these measures , noting export credits distort the market and that the [LOC U.S.  ] is shouldering the burden because it has no business in [LOC Iran.  ] ---------------------------------------- [ORG ABN Amro Cuts Off All Business with Iran  ] ---------------------------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) During a meeting with [PER Rijkman Groenink  ] , Chairman of the Managing Board , and [ORG ABN Amro  ] 's senior compliance officers , [PER Groenink  ] told [PER U/S Levey  ] that [ORG ABN Amro  ] is ceasing all business with [LOC Iran  ] and will not process U-turn transactions for any [MISC Iranian  ] bank . 
According to [PER Carin Gorter  ] , Senior Vice President Compliance and Legal , [ORG ABN Amro  ] has closed all but 16 [MISC Iran-related  ] accounts , and that these will be closed in a few months . 
[PER Groenink  ] said that [ORG ABN Amro  ] 's policy will exclude [MISC Iranian  ] government persons and entities and it deliberately excludes all [MISC Iranian  ] people because of the deceptive practices of their regime . 
He explained their reasoning for cutting off trade in all currencies by noting , there isn't a difference in terms of risk between trade in Dollars and trade in [ORG Euros  ] . 
At some point , you have to make a decision based on your own moral judgement . 
Regarding [ORG UNSCR  ] 1737 implementation , the bank is waiting for guidance from the [ORG EU  ] , but has already begun to filter and reject any questionable transactions . 
According to [PER Gorter  ] , when an [MISC Iranian  ] transaction is submitted , the bank reaches out to the local government with jurisdiction over the transaction . 
If that government gives them permission to freeze , then the money is frozen . 
If the government does not authorize a freeze , then the transaction is rejected. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [PER U/S Levey  ] complimented [PER Groenink  ] for [ORG ABN Amro  ] 's efforts . 
[PER U/S Levey  ] stressed the importance of financial sector participation in countering proliferation , since -- unlike terrorism finance -- it is more often the case that proliferators use banks to move and store money ( since proliferators typically engage in ostensibly legitimate commercial transactions ) . 
He added that these bank meetings were consultative , not regulatory , in nature and inquired about the reaction of [MISC Dutch  ] customers to denied [LOC Iran  ] THE [MISC HAGUE  ] 00000566 004 OF 004 business . 
[PER Groenink  ] said it is not difficult to explain , and that the policy also applies to [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Sudan  ] , for example . 
It is a small problem , he added , as customers face exposing their interests in [LOC Iran  ] by seeking financial services from [ORG ABN Amro.  ] <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [PER Groenink  ] said that the 2005 cease and desist order and fine from [LOC U.S.  ] regulators and the [ORG Dutch Central Bank  ] was a shock to the system . 
( NOTE: In 2005 , [ORG Treasury  ] and the [ORG Federal Reserve  ] fined [ORG ABN Amro  ] $80 million for a series of banking violations , including failing to adequately report suspicious transactions and knowingly deleting originator information from [MISC Iranian  ] and [MISC Libyan  ] transactions bound for the [LOC U.S.  ] END NOTE . 
) This led to large investments in global filtering , information technology , and increasing awareness among employees . 
As a result of these changes , [PER Groenink  ] said [ORG ABN Amro  ] is now fully [ORG OFAC  ] compliant worldwide and has adopted a strict policy against cover payments. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( U ) Dutch-founded [ORG ABN Amro  ] has 105,000 employees . 
It is the eighth largest bank in [LOC Europe  ] and the thirteenth largest in the world based on total assets. -------------------------------------- [ORG ING Cuts Off Dollar Business with Iran  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) In a separate meeting with [ORG ING  ] compliance officers and their general council , [PER U/S Levey  ] said that [LOC Iran  ] engages in three categories of deceptive practices . 
First , [LOC Iran  ] uses its state-owned banks to hide its illicit activities . 
For example , [LOC Iran  ] funnels funds through [ORG Bank Saderat  ] to [ORG Hizbollah  ] and uses [ORG Bank Sepah  ] for missile proliferation . 
Second , [LOC Iran  ] uses front companies to procure items for its nuclear missile programs . 
Third , [LOC Iran  ] uses cover payments to obscure transactions when there is no good , legitimate reason to do so . 
[PER U/S Levey  ] encouraged [ORG ING  ] to carefully evaluate the risk of business with [LOC Iran  ] . 
He pointed out that the reputational risk to the bank is the same , regardless of the currency of the transaction. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) [ORG ING  ] 's Deputy Chief Risk Officer , [PER Koos Timmermans  ] , told [PER U/S Levey  ] [ORG ING  ] opposes cover payments , and thought that a new SWIFT field could address complications such as chain payments that cross international boundaries . 
He added [ORG ING  ] has less than a basis point of business in [LOC Iran  ] , there is no retail business , and [ORG ING  ] has no branch office in the country . 
The remaining business is based on contractual obligations with customers having global export operations , he said . 
[ORG ING  ] is also not actively seeking [LOC Iran  ] business . 
He added [ORG ING  ] would be reluctant to step into the [MISC Iranian  ] market if all other banks were departing , and that [ORG ING  ] 's compliance department was carefully involved in monitoring the risks of [LOC Iran  ] business , including reputational risk . 
[PER Timmermans  ] said [ORG ING  ] had blocked all accounts with [ORG Bank Sepah  ] . 
[PER Jan-Willem Vink  ] , [ORG ING General Counsel  ] , said by policy [ORG ING  ] allows no dollar transactions , with non-dollar transactions subject to restrictions. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( U ) [MISC Dutch  ] origin [ORG ING  ] has 120,000 employees and is ranked among the top 20 banks worldwide and top 10 in [LOC Europe  ] based on market capitalization .
