( C/REL [ORG NATO  ] ) SUMMARY: [LOC Macedonia  ] is in its 7th MAP cycle and has made significant progress in meeting its defense reform goals , but still falls short in terms of meeting political and economic MAP criteria . 
To be considered a strong candidate for [ORG NATO  ] membership by mid-2007 , with a view to receiving an invitation in 2008 , we believe [LOC Macedonia  ] should meet the following key criteria: Strengthen democracy and the rule of law , and combat corruption by : --conducting free and fair parliamentary elections in 2006 that meet internationally-accepted standards ; --fully implementing the judicial reforms package to strengthen the independence and efficiency of the judiciary ; and , --showing significant progress in aggressively prosecuting high-profile corruption cases . 
Create a better business environment by: --meeting the milestones established for [MISC World Bank-financed  ] projects on real estate and cadastre registration , and implementing judicial reforms regarding contract enforcement ; and , --completing in a transparent manner the privatization of the state energy distribution and generation companies , with full accountability for the use of funds derived from that action . 
Continue defense reforms by: --pursuing defense personnel downsizing while ensuring equitable representation of ethnic minorities in the [LOC Armed Forces  ] , but in a manner that ensures qualified personnel are selected and that training and promotion standards are not lowered . 
This message develops these key criteria further and addresses additional political , economic , and defense issues and goals . 
End Summary . 
KEY POLITICAL CRITERIA: <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( SBU/REL [ORG NATO  ] ) [ORG Electoral Reform:  ] The 2005 local elections , as noted by [ORG OSCE  ] and other international and domestic observers , were marred by serious electoral irregularities in some areas , including ballot-stuffing , group voting , and some election-day violence . 
Since then , the [ORG GOM  ] has worked with [ORG OSCE  ] experts to draft an electoral code that addresses electoral system concerns raised by the [ORG International Community  ] ( [ORG IC  ] ) in relation to the 2005 and other past elections . 
The electoral code is in the parliamentary review process , and [ORG Parliament  ] is expected to pass it by mid-March. --Electoral Bodies: In addition to revising the electoral code to strengthen administration of upcoming parliamentary elections in summer 2006 , the government recently addressed long-held [ORG IC  ] concerns regarding inadequate funding , housing , equipment , and staffing for the [ORG State Electoral Administration  ] ( [ORG SEC  ] ) , which is responsible for administering the elections . 
The [ORG SEC  ] now has an adequate budget ; initial staffing ; new offices ; and sufficient equipment to allow it to perform its core functions . 
The [ORG SEC Secretariat  ] already is undertaking planning and initial steps to prepare for the 2006 parliamentary elections. --Parliamentary Elections: The key test of the strength of [LOC Macedonia  ] , s democratic system will be the 2006 parliamentary elections . 
The [ORG IC  ] is working with the government , political party leaders and party cadres , and the state electoral SKOPJE 00000105 002 OF 007 bodies to help ensure free and fair elections , as judged by [MISC OSCE/ODIHR  ] and other international and domestic monitors . 
Key Message: Should [LOC Macedonia  ] fail this task , it would call into question the country , s readiness to present itself as a strong candidate for a [ORG NATO  ] membership invitation in 2008. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/REL [ORG NATO  ] ) [ORG Judicial Reform:  ] The [ORG Parliament  ] in December 2005 passed a package of 11 constitutional amendments strengthening the independence and efficiency of the judiciary . 
The amendments sharply curtail the role of [ORG Parliament  ] in selecting judges , who will now be selected and dismissed by an independent [ORG State Judicial Council  ] . 
The [ORG Parliament  ] is expected to pass bylaws to implement the amendments in the first half of 2006 . 
Key Message: By mid-2007 , the government should have passed and implemented the draft Law on Courts to allow trials of serious crimes and organized crime cases , and should implement a court case management system assigning cases to judges on a random basis ; implement and use the Law on Witness Protection as appropriate in prosecuting organized crime cases ; and enforce asset forfeitures in money-laundering or other serious crime cases. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/REL [ORG NATO  ] ) Corruption: [LOC Macedonia  ] was ranked 104 of 159 countries in the 2005 [ORG Transparency International  ] annual corruption perception index ( CPI ) report . 
It dropped several places compared to 2004 , although its overall score remained the same , at 2.7 out of a possible 10 ( 10 being least corrupt . 
) . 
Combating corruption is one of the government , s most daunting challenges ; very few high-profile corruption cases have been successfully prosecuted , with even fewer cases involving a significant sentence as a sanction . 
Key Message: To enhance [LOC Macedonia  ] , s competitiveness as a [ORG NATO  ] candidate , the [MISC Macedonian  ] Public Prosecutor , s office should successfully prosecute 3-5 high-profile corruption cases by mid-2007 . 
In addition , the [MISC Macedonian  ] courts should demonstrate that they can try those high-profile corruption cases in a fair and transparent fashion , as judged by independent observers ( local [ORG NGOs  ] , [ORG OSCE  ] Rule of Law experts ) , and any guilty verdicts should be accompanied by sanctions that will have a deterrent effect . 
OTHER POLITICAL ISSUES AND GOALS <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/REL [ORG NATO  ] ) Rule of [ORG Law: General  ] rule of law weaknesses hamper [LOC Macedonia  ] , s ability to demonstrate progress in meeting the political criteria of the [ORG NATO  ] MAP process . 
The [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] , s [ORG Professional Standards Unit  ] ( [ORG PSU  ] ) has investigated a number of allegations of police abuse , and has sanctioned such abuse when it occurred . 
However , the [ORG PSU  ] , s record is inconsistent , and systems to ensure transparency in the [ORG MOI  ] are inadequate . 
Similarly , [LOC Macedonia  ] , s fall from [ORG Tier  ] 1 to [ORG Tier  ] 2 in the [ORG State Department  ] , s annual Trafficking in [MISC Persons  ] ( TIP ) report for 2005 reflected lack of political commitment to combat aggressively lucrative organized crime activities , which was also reflected in the [ORG GOM  ] , s continuing lack of a [ORG National Action Plan  ] for combating TIP . 
The ability of defendants in civil lawsuits to file interminable , frivolous appeals prevents the [MISC Macedonian  ] courts from enforcing valid judgments -- for example , ordering the owner of [MISC Macedonian  ] TV station &A-18 to repay debts owed to the [MISC U.S.-based  ] non-profit [ORG Media Loan Development Fund  ] . 
By mid-2007 , the [ORG MOI  ] , s [ORG PSU  ] should have fully investigated and pressed charges , as applicable , in the majority of alleged police abuse cases alleged to have occurred in 2006 ; [MISC Macedonian  ] authorities should ensure the anti-TIP [ORG National Action Plan  ] has been approved and implemented , and [LOC Macedonia  ] should demonstrate progress in moving toward a [ORG Tier  ] 1 rating in the annual TIP report for <a id='par2006' href='#par2006'>¶</a>2006. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( SBU/REL [ORG NATO  ] ) Minority Rights: The final legislative requirement of the 2001 [MISC Ohrid Framework Agreement  ] ( [ORG FWA  ] ) was met in 2005 , but implementation of FWA-mandated measures to improve minority rights has been uneven . 
The government needs to continue steady efforts to implement equitable representation of minorities in public administration . 
At the same time , the government ( across ethnic lines ) should guard against fulfilling quotas at the expense of individual [LOC SKOPJE  ] 00000105 003 OF 007 capacity to perform a job . 
The [ORG GOM  ] also should continue to implement decentralization that empowers minorities at the local level , and in a manner that presents [LOC Macedonia  ] as a regional model for consolidating stability through strengthening inter-ethnic cooperation. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/REL [ORG NATO  ] ) Neighborly Relations: [LOC Macedonia  ] collaborates actively with its neighbors and other countries in the region , and should strive to export its experience as a positive example of best practices in that regard . 
It is working on resolving several outstanding bilateral issues , including the name dispute with [LOC Greece  ] ( through talks under [ORG UN  ] auspices ) , and the question of demarcating its border with [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
The dispute between the [MISC Serbian  ] Orthodox Church ( [ORG SOC  ] ) and the [MISC Macedonian  ] Orthodox Church ( [ORG MOC  ] ) over which should enjoy primacy among orthodox [MISC Christian  ] believers in [LOC Macedonia  ] remains a challenge for the government , which is working on a draft law on religious communities that would make it possible for the [ORG SOC  ] to officially register as a religious group in [LOC Macedonia  ] . 
The imprisonment last year of a [ORG SOC  ] Bishop ( &Bishop Jovan8 ) on grounds of inciting religious hatred for publishing a calendar was roundly criticized by the international community and many human rights [ORG NGOs  ] . 
The government should work to ensure passage of the draft Law on Religious Communities that would help ease tensions between the [ORG MOC  ] and the [ORG SOC  ] by allowing an [MISC SOC-affiliated  ] group to receive legal protection as a recognized religious group in [LOC Macedonia  ] . 
The government also should continue to work on resolving the name dispute with [LOC Greece  ] through the talks being held under [ORG UN  ] auspices. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( SBU/REL [ORG NATO  ] ) Border Issues: The only remaining contentious border issue is , as mentioned above , the unresolved demarcation of [LOC Macedonia  ] , s boundary with [LOC Kosovo  ] , which was delineated in a 2001 agreement between [LOC Belgrade  ] and [LOC Skopje  ] . 
[LOC Pristina  ] does not recognize the 2001 agreement , and is unwilling to consider demarcating the border with [LOC Macedonia  ] until after final status is resolved. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/REL [ORG NATO  ] ) POW and Holocaust Issues: There are no unresolved POW issues . 
The government receives high marks from the [MISC Israeli  ] government and in the [ORG State Department  ] , s [ORG International Religious Freedom  ] report for handling [MISC Jewish  ] community restitution issues . 
Ground-breaking for a Holocaust memorial site in downtown [LOC Skopje  ] took place in 2005 , and [MISC Jewish  ] community representatives generally express satisfaction with the government , s actions to resolve outstanding property claims . 
KEY ECONOMIC CRITERIA: <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( SBU/REL [ORG NATO  ] ) Business Climate: The government has made significant economic reform progress in a number of areas , including recent implementation of a &one-stop shop window8 that has significantly reduced the time required for registering a new business . 
However , more needs to be done to create an economic climate that will attract increased investment ( [ORG FDI  ] was slightly lower in 2005 than in the previous year ) and bring official unemployment figures down from their current high of 37 percent ( taking the grey economy into account , the actual rate is closer to 25 percent ) . <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( SBU/REL [ORG NATO  ] ) [MISC Macro-Economic Achievements:  ] The government , s most significant economic achievement has been the maintenance of fiscal discipline , combined with consistent macroeconomic stability . 
The economy has grown at a consistent rate of 2 to 4 percent from 2002 to 2005 . 
The government budget deficit is low ( -0.6% in 2005 ) , inflation minimal ( 0.5% in 2005 ) , the currency is stable , and the level of debt-to-GDP ( 40% ) is manageable . 
In 2005 , the Government signed agreements for three-year programs with both the [ORG International Monetary Fund  ] ( [ORG IMF  ] ) and [ORG World Bank  ] . 
Both [ORG Standard & Poor  ] , s and [ORG Fitch Rating Service  ] rated [LOC Macedonia  ] at or near investment grade for sovereign debt . 
In December 2005 , [LOC Macedonia  ] successfully sold 150 million euros worth of euro bonds and used the proceeds to purchase its [ORG London Club  ] debt in order to lower its debt servicing costs . 
[LOC SKOPJE  ] 00000105 004 OF 007 <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( SBU/REL [ORG NATO  ] ) Foreign Investment & Economic Freedom: Despite significant progress , business investment , both domestic and foreign , is low ; the current account deficit is relatively high ; and GDP growth rate is not strong enough to significantly lower unemployment or the poverty rate . 
[LOC Macedonia  ] ranks 57th in the [ORG Heritage Foundation  ] , s 2005 Index of [ORG Economic Freedom  ] , behind [MISC A-3  ] partners [LOC Albania  ] ( 52nd ) and [LOC Croatia  ] ( 55th ) . 
If the government fails to take the following steps , among others , to enhance the business climate , [ORG FDI  ] levels and economic growth will remain anemic: --Key Message: Business environment ) the government should meet the milestones for [MISC World Bank-financed  ] project on real estate and cadastre registration , and implement judicial reforms regarding contract enforcement. --Key Message: Privatization ) the [ORG GOM  ] should privatize the energy distribution ( [ORG ESM  ] ) and generation ( [ORG ELEM  ] ) companies in a transparent manner and should fully account for the use of funds derived from that action . 
It also should sell its remaining shares in the privatized [MISC Macedonian  ] Telecommunication company . 
KEY DEFENSE CRITERIA: <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C/REL [ORG NATO  ] ) Overall Progress . 
[LOC Macedonia  ] continues to progress well on defense reforms . 
In 2005 , [LOC Macedonia  ] met its goal of restructuring 60% of the [ORG Army of the Republic of Macedonia  ] 's ( [ORG ARM  ] 's ) units in accordance with their [ORG Strategic Defense Review  ] ( [ORG SDR  ] ) . 
By the end of 2006 , the [ORG GOM  ] expects 90% of the [ORG ARM  ] , s units will have been restructured. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C/REL [ORG NATO  ] ) Additional defense reform milestones completed under a dynamic and proactive CHOD include: reorganization of the General Staff and 1st [ORG Mechanized Infantry Brigade  ] ; transfer of the [ORG Air Force  ] to the [ORG ARM  ] 's [ORG Air Wing  ] ; and establishment of the [ORG Joint Operations Command  ] as the [ORG ARM  ] 's [ORG Maneuver Force Headquarters  ] . 
The [ORG ARM  ] also took the first steps in 2005 toward assuming full host nation support responsibilities by assigning officers and Non-Commissioned Officers ( NCOs ) to [ORG NATO  ] Headquarters-Skopje . 
The [ORG MOD  ] will establish a [ORG Host Nation Coordination Center  ] by mid-2006. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C/REL [ORG NATO  ] ) Personnel Reductions: The [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] ( [ORG MOD  ] ) and [ORG ARM  ] have been less successful in carrying out the personnel reductions called for in the [ORG SDR  ] . 
To date , they have made the easy cuts , mostly personnel transfers . 
For example , the [ORG MOD  ] gave up the border security mission to the new Border Police . 
It also divested itself of the people and offices that are now independent governmental agencies , such as the [ORG Rescue and Protection Directorate  ] and the [ORG Crisis Management Center  ] . 
The [ORG MOD  ] must cut approximately 1,200 military and civilian personnel to complete its personnel reductions plan . 
The new draft Law on Defense will open up the possibility of retiring excess officers with 25 years of service , but that measure does not apply to the civilians at the [MISC Ministry.  ] <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C/REL [ORG NATO  ] ) [ORG Equitable  ] Representation: [ORG Equitable  ] representation of minorities in the armed forces continues to increase . 
Ethnic [MISC Albanians  ] , for example , now constitute nearly 12 percent of the total force ; the percentage is higher among the NCOs ( 15 percent ) and soldiers ( 16 percent ) . 
However , there is clear evidence that the coalition ethnic [MISC Albanian  ] governing party ( DUI ) is pressuring the military to accelerate the pace of integration , especially within the officer and NCO ranks , even if that means lowering standards for promotions and professional development courses . 
Key Message: The government , including its ethnic [MISC Albanian  ] coalition partners , should be reminded that equitable representation , which we support , nevertheless must not be implemented by placing unqualified personnel in positions of responsibility. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C/REL [ORG NATO  ] ) Defense Spending . 
[LOC Macedonia  ] continues to devote between 2.2-2.4 percent of its GDP to defense spending . 
This year the defense budget is 6.201 billion [MISC Macedonian  ] denars ( approximately 124 million USD ) , about 2.25 percent of GDP . 
Although that figure is two million dollars [ORG SKOPJE  ] 00000105 005 OF 007 less than in 2005 , it represents a net increase , since spending on functions such as border security and crisis management are no longer part of the [ORG MOD  ] 's budget . 
Defense spending is expected to remain consistent in the near to mid-term ; this predictability is assisting the [ORG MOD  ] in managing its defense modernization programs for at least the next five years. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C/REL [ORG NATO  ] ) Modernization . 
[LOC Macedonia  ] has offered [ORG NATO  ] eleven ( 11 ) units under the [ORG NATO Operational Capabilities Concept  ] , ranging from an infantry company to a special forces company , helicopter detachment , engineer platoon , and demining squad . 
Some of these units are ready now ; others will not be fully operational until the end of 2007 . 
The [ORG ARM  ] is rightly focusing its resources , both domestic and international , on getting these units fully operational , both in terms of equipment and training . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] will provide $5 million in Foreign Military Funding in [LOC FY06  ] , most of which is also being targeted for these " declared " units . 
One million [LOC U.S.  ] dollars in [MISC Global Peace Operations Initiative  ] funds have also become available , which the [ORG ARM  ] would like to spend on readying their military police battalion for deployment . 
[LOC Macedonia  ] also is an active participant in the [MISC Partnership for Peace  ] ( [ORG PfP  ] ) , participating in over 15 different exercises in 2005 , including hosting [ORG NATO  ] 's " [MISC Cooperative Associate  ] " Exercise in [ORG Skopje  ] last [ORG November.  ] <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C/REL [ORG NATO  ] ) [MISC Global War  ] on Terrorism ( [ORG GWOT  ] ) . 
[LOC Macedonia  ] continues to be a net contributor to security , its armed forces earning high marks for their performance in [ORG GWOT  ] operations . 
[LOC Macedonia  ] , s troop contributions to the [ORG GWOT  ] demonstrate that it can be a meaningful contributor as a future [ORG NATO  ] member country as well . 
In December 2005 , [LOC Macedonia  ] increased its participation in [LOC Iraq  ] by deploying five more staff officers above its normal 35-man rotation . 
In [LOC Afghanistan  ] , it is deploying eleven officers/NCOs with the [ORG Headquarters  ] of the [ORG Southeastern Europe Brigade  ] ( [ORG SEEBRIG  ] ) , rotating its four medical personnel with the [ORG Adriatic Charter  ] 's [ORG Joint Medical Team  ] , and increasing from 19 to 21 the personnel it has attached to the [MISC German  ] [ORG Battle Group  ] in [LOC Kabul  ] . 
By the end of February , [LOC Macedonia  ] will have increased its contribution to [ORG NATO Operations  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] from 23 personnel to 36 . 
Including the personnel assigned to [LOC Iraq  ] and [ORG U.S. Central Command Headquarters  ] , it will soon have a total of 78 personnel deployed overseas . 
That figure represents a considerable commitment for [LOC Macedonia  ] . 
While we expect the [ORG GOM  ] to remain committed to participating in international military operations , the [ORG ARM  ] will continue in the future to have to rely on other countries for strategic transport and logistical support in-theater. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C/REL [ORG NATO  ] ) Interoperability with [ORG NATO  ] . 
The combined effect of six [ORG ARM  ] rotations in [LOC Iraq  ] , eight [ORG ARM  ] rotations in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [ORG PfP  ] exercises , and [LOC U.S.  ] FMF/IMET support has directly improved the [ORG ARM  ] 's capabilities and interoperability with [ORG NATO  ] . 
Not every unit of the [ORG ARM  ] has benefited from this exposure , however . 
Many conscript units focus mainly on fulfilling garrison duties . 
Nevertheless , the performance of [MISC Macedonian  ] units in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] has been exemplary , and should be taken as a demonstration of the [ORG ARM  ] 's potential as a future [ORG NATO  ] member. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C/REL [ORG NATO  ] ) [ORG Crisis Management Center:  ] To get the [ORG MOD  ] out of direct involvement in managing crisis management operations , the government created the [ORG civilian-run Crisis Management Center  ] ( [ORG CMC  ] ) in 2005 . 
The [ORG CMC  ] received an independent budget in January 2006 , but squabbles between the ethnic [MISC Albanian  ] [ORG CMC  ] Director and the government over equitable representation in staffing the center have prevented it from becoming fully operational . 
In a region plagued by frequent floods and occasional earthquakes , the country , s lack of effective crisis management capacity is unacceptable . 
Key Message: The [ORG CMC  ] should be adequately staffed , fully operational , and capable of responding to disasters by mid-2007 . 
Although equitable representation should be considered in deciding on personnel , the Center should be staffed by qualified personnel . 
LEGAL ISSUES: [ORG SKOPJE  ] 00000105 006 OF 007 <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( SBU/REL [ORG NATO  ] ) There are no significant constitutional or legal barriers that would prevent [LOC Macedonia  ] , s accession to [ORG NATO  ] or its participation in [ORG NATO  ] operations . 
The [MISC Macedonian  ] constitution provides that the [LOC Parliament  ] can approve proposals to join international organizations by a majority vote . 
Participation in peacekeeping operations outside the country requires the approval of a majority in [LOC Parliament  ] , and the government can decide to participate in exercises or humanitarian operations without [LOC Parliament  ] , s approval . 
Upon ratification of an accession agreement , the [LOC Law  ] on Defense would have to be amended to harmonize [MISC Macedonian  ] law with [ORG NATO  ] , s collective defense provisions , according to [LOC Macedonia  ] , s [ORG ANP  ] . 
SECURITY/INTELLIGENCE ISSUES: <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( C/REL [ORG NATO  ] ) The [ORG Law on Classified Information  ] was passed in March 2005 , expanding the responsibilities of the [ORG Directorate for Security of Classified Information  ] to include all classified information exchanged between the [LOC Republic of Macedonia  ] and foreign countries or international organizations . 
According to the government , the provisions of the [ORG Law on Classified Information  ] are consistent with [ORG NATO Security Policy  ] requirements . 
In addition , the government is drafting guidelines for [ORG Security Officers  ] charged by various state institutions to ensure the bylaws of the [ORG Law on Classified Information  ] are implemented within those institutions . 
In practice , however , political control over [MISC Macedonian  ] intelligence and security agencies results in occasional leaks of sensitive information to political parties. <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( C/REL [ORG NATO  ] ) [LOC Macedonia  ] , s three intelligence services ( [MISC Macedonian  ] [ORG Intelligence Agency  ] , subordinate to the President ; military intelligence ; and the [LOC MOI  ] , s counter-intelligence agency ) do not cooperate closely and are hampered by outmoded missions . 
PUBLIC SUPPORT: <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( SBU/REL [ORG NATO  ] ) Public support for [ORG NATO  ] membership is strong ) 90 percent in a poll conducted in January ( among ethnic [MISC Albanians  ] , that figure reaches 96 percent . 
) No government or opposition Member of [LOC Parliament  ] has voted against a deployment of [MISC Macedonian  ] troops overseas to support alliance operations in [LOC Iraq  ] or [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Prudent expectations management -- on the part of the government , [ORG USG  ] , and [ORG NATO  ] -- will help ensure strong public support through the [ORG Riga Summit  ] and well into 2007 . 
WATCH OUT FORS: <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The case of [PER Khalid el-Masri  ] , a [MISC German  ] citizen of [MISC Lebanese  ] descent who claims he was flow by the [ORG CIA  ] from [LOC Macedonia  ] to [LOC Afghanistan  ] for interrogation , has generated intense press commentary here , most of it negative , over the past several months . 
Opposition parties and opinion-shapers accuse the government of jeopardizing [LOC Macedonia  ] , s [ORG EU  ] accession chances by refusing to comprehensively answer [ORG Council of Europe  ] and [MISC European  ] Parliament requests for a full accounting in the case . 
Relevant government authorities have responded carefully to [ORG COE  ] and [ORG EU  ] requests for information , consistently explaining that they have little information to provide on el-Masri and his allegations . 
There has been some mention in the press of alleged secret [ORG CIA  ] prisons on [MISC Macedonian  ] soil , but those stories have not had the same staying power as the el-Masri case. <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( [LOC C/NOFORN  ] ) [LOC Macedonia  ] signed an [ORG Article  ] 98 agreement with us in 2003 , and the government has expressed concern that it eventually will come under strong [ORG EU  ] pressure to abrogate that agreement as it works on bring its legislation into compliance with the [ORG EU  ] acquis communautaire . 
The matter is treated as a mid-to-long term issue in [LOC Macedonia  ] , s [ORG EU  ] membership action plan , but could come up in the course of future discussions. <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
( C/REL [ORG NATO  ] ) The government will press for a positive [ORG SKOPJE  ] 00000105 007 OF 007 statement at the [ORG Riga Summit  ] , possibly singling out [LOC Macedonia  ] as a leading [ORG NATO  ] membership candidate due to its defense and political reform achievements , and assuring aspirants that enlargement will be on the agenda in 2008 .
