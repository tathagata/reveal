Moreno  ] , reason 1.4 ( b ) a nd ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY . 
On June 10 , [PER Fred Hof  ] , Special Advisor for [ORG Regional Affairs  ] in the office of Special [PER Envoy Mitchell  ] , held a series of meetings with [ORG GOI  ] officials from the [ORG MFA  ] and [ORG MOD  ] to discuss the situation in [LOC Lebanon  ] and [LOC Syria  ] and the possibilities for progress towards opening negotiations with each . 
The [MISC Israeli  ] officials expressed cautious optimism over the election results in [LOC Lebanon  ] , but did not believe they would lead to major changes in the power balance in [LOC Lebanon  ] , or serious reduction of [ORG Hizballah  ] influence . 
However , both [PER Amos Gilad  ] , Pol-Mil Director in the [ORG MOD  ] and [PER Nimrod Barkan  ] , Director of the [ORG MFA Political Research Division  ] ( [ORG INR  ] equivalent ) , told [PER Hof  ] that the [MISC Lebanese  ] election results took [LOC Syria  ] by surprise , and were a blow for [MISC Syrian  ] President [PER Asad  ] . 
The officials were split over the prospects for [MISC Israeli  ] peace with [LOC Syria  ] . 
[PER Alon Ushpiz  ] , Chief of Staff for the [ORG MFA  ] Director General , believes [LOC Syria  ] is only interested in a process that gives it international legitimacy . 
However , in a separate meeting , [PER Gilad  ] called [MISC Syrian/Iran  ] ties a “marriage of convenience” which could possibly be broken with a peace agreement with [LOC Israel  ] and incentives from the [LOC United States  ] . 
On [LOC Ghajar  ] and [LOC Sheba’a  ] , there was consensus within the [ORG GOI  ] that [LOC Ghajar  ] can be resolved , but doing so will not have much utility , while [MISC Israeli  ] will only agree to discuss [LOC Sheba’a  ] within the context of [LOC Syria  ] . 
End Summary. ---------------------------- [LOC Lebanon  ] Elections Hurt [LOC Syria  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The [MISC Israeli  ] officials said that it is too soon to tell what the results of the elections in [LOC Lebanon  ] will really mean . 
[PER Nimrod Barkan  ] told [PER Hof  ] that he does not see the elections as damaging for [ORG Hizballah  ] , as their popularity among the [LOC Shia  ] remained solid . 
He added that if [ORG Hizballah  ] could maintain its blocking third within the [ORG GOL  ] as established in the [LOC Doha Agreement  ] , the [MISC Lebanese  ] government would remain paralyzed . 
In another meeting , [PER Amos Gilad  ] assessed that the elections results were largely due to huge amounts of [MISC Saudi Arabian  ] money and the [MISC Maronite Patriarch  ] throwing his support to March 14 , and not because of a fundamental shift in [MISC Lebanese  ] society. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) On the other hand , both [PER Gilad  ] and [PER Barkan  ] agreed that the elections were a blow to [LOC Syria  ] , which was completely caught off-guard by the results . 
The [MISC Syrian  ] presidential advisors on [LOC Lebanon  ] , they said , are now in trouble . 
[PER Barkan  ] explained that the [MISC Syrians  ] were so convinced the pro-Syrian March 8 would win the elections that they thought they could minimize their interference and still win . 
They wanted to appease [LOC France  ] and the [LOC United States  ] , and not irritate [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , and thought they could do so at no cost . 
In this way , [PER Barkan  ] said , [MISC French  ] and [MISC American  ] actions and rhetoric in support of March 14 were productive. --------------------------------------------- ------- [ORG Hizballah  ] Still Planning to Avenge Mughniyah’s Death --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) [PER Barkan  ] emphasized that [ORG Hizballah  ] still plans on avenging the death of [ORG Hizballah  ] operations chief [PER Imad Mughniyah  ] , and that [LOC Israel  ] has already thwarted two terror attacks in third countries . 
[PER Barkan  ] said [LOC Israel  ] has very sensitive intelligence that [ORG Hizballah  ] has completed operational planning for a third attack outside [LOC Israel  ] , but so far [PER Nasrallah  ] has not decided whether to give the order to carry it out , despite [MISC Iranian  ] pressure to launch the attack . 
[PER Barkan  ] said he had personally drafted the MFA’s post-Lebanon election statement , which included a warning the [ORG GOL  ] that [LOC Israel  ] will hold them responsible for any attacks “emanating from [LOC Lebanon”  ] and not just attacks from [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
[PER Gilad  ] also told [PER Hof  ] that [ORG Hizballah  ] had shown restraint in the face of [MISC Iranian  ] pressure due to the elections , especially during the [LOC Gaza  ] operation . 
[PER Barkan  ] and [PER Gilad  ] both emphasized that they did not know if Hizballah’s calculus would change post-election . 
[PER Gilad  ] warned [PER Hof  ] that the next round of fighting with [ORG Hizballah  ] would likely involve rockets falling on [LOC Tel Aviv  ] , and if this happens [LOC Israel  ] will respond harshly throughout [LOC Lebanon.  ] ------------------------------------ Can [LOC Syria  ] Separate Itself from [LOC Iran  ] ? ------------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Hof  ] also held a meeting with senior [ORG MFA  ] staff , including Deputy Director General for Coordination ( Director General Chief of Staff ) [PER Alon Ushpiz  ] , Minister Lieberman’s Chief of Staff [PER Naor Gilon  ] , and Deputy Minister Ayalon’s Chief [LOC TEL AVIV  ] 00001324 002 OF 003 of Staff [PER David Siegel  ] . 
[PER Ushpiz  ] asked [PER Hof  ] if the [LOC United States  ] really sought peace with [LOC Syria  ] in the near term , or if it saw [MISC Israeli  ] engagement with [LOC Syria  ] as a way to put pressure on the [MISC Palestinian  ] track , create space in the [MISC Arab  ] world , and gain influence with [LOC Syria  ] . 
[PER Hof  ] replied that all of those goals could be pursued simultaneously , including peace . 
During the proximity talks in [LOC Turkey  ] conducted under the [ORG Olmert  ] government , [PER Ushpiz  ] said that President [PER Bush  ] gave PM [ORG Olmert  ] the approval to hold talks through [LOC Turkey  ] , but said the [LOC United States  ] would not get involved , so [LOC Israel  ] went as far as it could . 
[LOC Israel  ] was also unsure about proceeding because , they said , the [ORG GOI  ] remained skeptical regarding Syria’s intentions to withdraw itself from its alliance with [LOC Iran  ] in exchange for peace. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Amos Gilad  ] , on the other hand , told [PER Hof  ] that the [ORG GOI  ] defense establishment assesses that [LOC Syria  ] may be serious about removing itself from [LOC Iran  ] and withdrawing support for [ORG Hizballah  ] in exchange for reconciliation with the [LOC West  ] , especially the [LOC U.S.  ] , and the return of the [LOC Golan Heights  ] . 
[PER Gilad  ] asserted that peace with [LOC Syria  ] is critical to achieving [MISC Israel-Palestinian  ] peace due to Syria’s ability to support spoilers . 
Therefore , he asserted , it was worth it for [LOC Israel  ] to make the attempt . 
In the talks through [MISC Turkish  ] mediation , however , [PER Gilad  ] said that [LOC Israel  ] had been too forthcoming about its security requirements , and too enthusiastic , and [LOC Syria  ] was not ready . 
He also noted that [MISC Israeli  ] security requirements with [LOC Syria  ] had changed radically since the last talks in 2000 , as [LOC Israel  ] no longer fears a [MISC Syrian  ] surprise armor attack across the [LOC Golan  ] but rather is concerned about [MISC Syrian  ] missile attacks on [MISC Israeli  ] cities , so those issues would need to be renegotiated. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) Negotiations with [LOC Syria  ] may succeed , [PER Gilad  ] said , because [LOC Iran  ] was a marriage of convenience for [LOC Syria  ] . 
He believes [LOC Syria  ] would much rather be close to their fellow [MISC Arabs  ] and the rest of the international community , if given the chance . 
[PER Gilad  ] stressed that both the [MISC Iranians  ] and the [MISC Arab  ] Sunnis despise the ruling Alawite minority in [LOC Syria  ] - he recalled that [PER Sadat  ] used to call the [MISC Alawites  ] “pagans” - and said the [MISC Iranians  ] would like to get rid of the [MISC Asad  ] regime at the appropriate time . 
[PER Gilad  ] noted that [LOC Syria  ] did not inform [LOC Iran  ] of its nuclear reactor , which was built entirely with [MISC North Korean  ] assistance , and did not notify [LOC Iran  ] in advance of its proximity talks with [LOC Israel  ] . 
In addition , he said , the [LOC Golan Heights  ] have remained Israel’s quietest front , evidence that [LOC Syria  ] can uphold its commitments as long its commitments are clear. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) While [LOC Syria  ] may want peace , [PER Gilad  ] cautioned that it may be impossible for [LOC Syria  ] to extricate itself from [LOC Iran  ] and [ORG Hizballah  ] , even if it tried . 
[ORG Hizballah  ] is now an integral part of Syria’s defense concept , and is a more effective fighting force than the [MISC Syrian  ] army . 
But in the end , [PER Gilad  ] stated , [LOC Israel  ] only has two choices with [MISC Syria:  ] war or peace. --------------------------------------------- ----- Hof: [ORG Small Steps Needed Towards Talks  ] with [LOC Lebanon  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Turning to the prospects for moving toward peace with [LOC Lebanon  ] , [PER Barkan  ] and [PER Gilad  ] separately told [PER Hof  ] that the [ORG GOI  ] had examined the question of renewing the 1949 armistice commission , at the [MISC USG’s  ] suggestion , and there were many questions , including some basic legal questions posed by [ORG MFA  ] lawyers . 
[PER Hof  ] replied that much of the armistice agreement is obsolete , but the armistice allows for mutually agreed modifications , and recognition of its basic legitimacy among the [MISC Lebanese  ] , and the fact that it is mentioned in the [MISC Taif Agreement  ] , could create cover for talks. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Hof  ] suggested an incremental strategy for [LOC Lebanon  ] , expanding existing , low-level mil-mil trilateral contacts with [ORG UNIFIL  ] gradually until they eventually can encompass some political progress . 
Small steps were needed because the [MISC Lebanese  ] people’s attitude toward [LOC Israel  ] had hardened over the past 30 years , [PER Hof  ] explained , and we need to get them back to seeing peace with [LOC Israel  ] as a realistic prospect. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Gilad  ] , [PER Barkan  ] , and the senior [ORG MFA  ] officials separately told [PER Hof  ] that [LOC Israel  ] was ready to move forward with resolving the issue of the northern end of the village of [LOC Ghajar  ] , but doubted that resolving the issue would lead to real progress and risked boosting [ORG Hizballah  ] . 
[PER Hof  ] replied that [LOC Ghajar  ] can be an important step as long as any [MISC Israeli  ] public message is carefully calibrated to emphasize that [LOC Israel  ] is fulfilling its 1701 obligations , and that other parties should do the same , and not as a benefit to the [MISC Lebanese  ] moderates . 
It is a small step , [PER Hof  ] said , but the kind of small step needed in this process . 
[LOC TEL AVIV  ] 00001324 003 OF 003 <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) On [ORG Sheba’a Farms  ] , all the [ORG GOI  ] officials separately repeated the long-standing position that [ORG Sheba’a  ] must be resolved in the context of [LOC Syria  ] and not [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
[ORG Sheba’a  ] , they said , was simply a pretext for Hizballah’s claim to represent “resistance to occupation , ” and if it were resolved [ORG Hizballah  ] would simply find another pretext . 
[PER Hof  ] agreed that it was a pretext , but thought it would be useful to make [ORG Hizballah  ] publicly shift their pretext . 
Issues like the seven [MISC Lebanese  ] villages in northern [LOC Israel  ] , [PER Hof  ] explained , are not taken seriously in [MISC Lebanese  ] society , but the [MISC Lebanese  ] claim to [ORG Sheba’a Farms  ] is . 
Forcing [ORG Hizballah  ] to shift its excuse for retaining an armed force could help expose them to [MISC Lebanese  ] society as [MISC Iranian  ] surrogates willing to fight to the last [MISC Lebanese.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( U ) [PER Fred Hof  ] has cleared this message. ********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy Tel Aviv’s Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv ********************************************* ******************** CUNNINGHAM</pre></code>
