( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: Representatives of [MISC Spanish  ] firm [ORG Telstar  ] met with ISN/CBM Director [PER Vann Van Diepen  ] on September 16 to explore [ORG Telstar  ] 's options for exporting its products to [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Van Diepen  ] explained that , under the agreement that [ORG Telstar  ] made to get previous [LOC Iran  ] Nonproliferation Act ( [ORG INPA  ] ) sanctions lifted , any [ORG Telstar  ] sales to [LOC Iran  ] would lead to the Department reimposing sanctions . 
[ORG Telstar  ] indicated that it now understood the breadth of [LOC U.S.  ] requirements and would not engage in sales to [LOC Iran  ] , including canceling its planned sale of steam sterilizers ( reftel ) . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) On September 16 , ISN/CBM Director [PER Vann Van Diepen  ] and PolMilOff met with [ORG Telstar  ] CEO [PER Ton Capella  ] and legal adviser [PER Xavier Bou  ] in [LOC Madrid  ] to discuss potential [ORG Telstar  ] sales to [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Capella  ] explained that [ORG Telstar  ] was confused by [LOC U.S.  ] policy and wanted to clarify whether it could sell any products to [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Capella  ] said that [ORG Telstar  ] had been careful to meet [MISC Spanish  ] and [ORG EU  ] rules , and didn't understand why the [LOC US  ] would prohibit [ORG Telstar  ] from exporting " non-dual-use " products to [LOC Iran  ] as long as it followed these rules. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Van Diepen  ] agreed that [ORG Telstar  ] appeared to have met [ORG EU  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] rules , but explained the [LOC U.S.  ] view of [LOC Iran  ] that led to the [ORG INPA  ] , and the much broader scope of INPA-reportable activity as compared to [ORG EU  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] export controls . 
Because the [LOC U.S.  ] understands that all [ORG Telstar  ] products would be of potential utility to a biological weapons program ( and therefore " dual-use " regardless of whether they were specifically controlled ) , any [ORG Telstar  ] sales to [LOC Iran  ] would lead to a reimposition of sanctions. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Capella  ] said that [ORG Telstar  ] does significant business in the [LOC U.S.  ] and couldn't afford to have sanctions reimposed . 
He indicated that [ORG Telstar  ] would cancel the planned sale of two custom-built steam sterilizers to [LOC Iran  ] , even though [ORG Telstar  ] would have to break its contract . 
He asked for assistance from the [ORG USG  ] in demonstrating that he had to break the contract due to " force majeure " and also in seeking alternative customers for the sterilizers . 
[PER Van Diepen  ] said that the [ORG USG  ] would do what it could to assist and designated the Embassy as the proper channel for any requests. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Capella  ] noted that [ORG Telstar  ] 's [MISC European  ] competitors sell similar products to [LOC Iran  ] , but have not received sanctions . 
[PER Van Diepen  ] explained that , if the [ORG USG  ] were to catch others making such sales , it would treat all companies and countries equally as a matter of [LOC U.S.  ] policy .
