( C ) [MISC SUMMARY: On  ] November 4 , the head of the [ORG UK’s “Operation Westbridge  ] , ” the [MISC British  ] government’s anti-narcotics operation at [ORG Accra International Airport  ] , told [ORG Poloff  ] that President [PER John Atta Mills  ] wants itemizers for the [MISC Presidential  ] suite at the airport to screen his entourage for drugs when leaving the country , and that the [ORG Narcotics Control Board’s  ] ( [ORG NACOB  ] ) placement of officers in the VVIP lounge at the airport has led to a decline in the number of departing passengers using the lounge . 
[PER O’Hagan  ] also said he believes that two of the [MISC USG-funded  ] itemizers at the airport were rendered useless by sabotage and suggested that airlines might be willing to pay for itemizer maintenance . 
END SUMMARY <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG Poloff  ] met November 4 with [PER Roland O’Hagan  ] , [ORG Project Manager for Operation Westbridge  ] and an official with the [ORG UK Border Agency  ] . 
[PER O’Hagan  ] said that President [PER Mills  ] had expressed interest in acquiring itemizers for the [MISC Presidential  ] suite at the airport in order to screen his entourage for drugs before boarding any departing flight . 
According to [PER O’Hagan  ] , [PER Mills  ] wants these officials to be checked in the privacy of his suite to avoid any surprises if they are caught carrying drugs . 
The itemizers , similar to those provided several years ago by the [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy through [ORG INL  ] funding , would be sensitive , portable screening devices that can detect the drug content in minuscule drops of human sweat after recent external contact or for up to three weeks after ingestion. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER O’Hagan  ] also said that [ORG NACOB  ] believes that the VVIP lounge at the airport has been a source of drugs leaving the country . 
Passengers leaving the lounge are driven directly to the plane and are not searched before departure . 
[ORG NACOB  ] placed two officers in the lounge to screen departing passengers , and the number of passengers using the VVIP lounge has decreased . 
( COMMENT: The Executive Secretary of [ORG NACOB  ] previously told Poloffs that bank managers , pastors , and their wives were given official passports and access to the lounge by the [ORG Kufuor  ] administration and questioned why these middle class travelers were awarded privileges traditionally reserved for cabinet ministers . 
END COMMENT ) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER O’Hagan  ] noted that among four itemizers provided to the GOG to detect drug smugglers among airline passengers , all are now non-functioning . 
According to [PER O’Hagan  ] , two itemizers that the USG gave to [ORG NACOB  ] are still operational . 
[PER O’Hagan  ] said that the airport itemizers were kept in a dusty , un-air conditioned room that caused them to break frequently . 
He noted that the airport director promised in October 2008 to install an air conditioner in the store room , but that she left her job two weeks after making the promise , and an air conditioner has not been installed. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Maintenance of the itemizers is an on-going concern . 
The equipment has broken frequently since it arrived , but [PER O’Hagan  ] said that the last two operational machines were incapacitated by sabotage . 
He believes the machines were sabotaged because they were in a storage room , and the filters were removed . 
The knowledge required to remove the filters exceeded the basic knowledge of the operators. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER O’Hagan  ] said that he believes the airlines might be willing to pay for the itemizers to be repaired , and specifically mentioned [ORG KLM  ] and [LOC Delta  ] . 
He noted that the cost of maintenance on the itemizers is less than the cost of diverting flights on which passengers suffer drug overdoses . 
Within the last few months , said [PER O’Hagan  ] , [ORG KLM  ] has diverted to [LOC Spain  ] two flights from [LOC Accra  ] to [LOC Amsterdam  ] because passengers started vomiting drugs . 
In both cases , the passenger died .
