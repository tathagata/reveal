( C ) Mr. Vice President: You last saw the President and Prime Minister of [LOC Kosovo  ] in [LOC Washington  ] during their first meetings with the new Administration in February , just after the one year anniversary of [LOC Kosovo’s  ] independence . 
That meeting proved a huge boost for a [LOC Kosovo  ] public anxious to be reassured of the continuing support of the [LOC United States  ] , and your visit here will further encourage [LOC Kosovo  ] to understand that it has the strong backing it needs , but must take the initiative on its own to pursue democratic and economic development in a way that meets the demands of its citizens. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) As [LOC Kosovo’s  ] leaders told you then , they have emerged at the end of a long and arduous journey with independence achieved , but many serious challenges ahead . 
Their accomplishments in the last 18 months and longer -- in fact throughout the difficult status determination period -- are admirable and should be recognized . 
At our urging , [LOC Kosovo  ] leaders have taken the high road and largely ignored the seemingly unendless provocations lobbed their way by successive regimes in [MISC Serbia:  ] violence in [LOC Kosovo’s  ] north sanctioned by [LOC Belgrade  ] , the destruction of customs operations on the border with [LOC Serbia  ] , [MISC Serbian  ] support for parallel governing institutions and parallel elections , the continuing refusal of [LOC Belgrade  ] to permit [LOC Kosovo  ] [MISC Serb  ] participation in multi-ethnic municipal administrations or in [LOC Kosovo’s  ] police and security forces , a [MISC Serbian  ] trade embargo on [LOC Kosovo’s  ] exports , the insistence on raising a case against [LOC Kosovo’s  ] declaration of independence in the [LOC International Court of Justice  ] , and -- lately -- efforts by [LOC Belgrade  ] to target prominent [LOC Kosovo  ] figures for prosecution in [LOC Serbia  ] and extradition from any [MISC Western  ] country where they may travel . 
Though the pro-Western government of [MISC Serbian  ] President [PER Boris Tadic  ] is an improvement on its predecessor in many ways , the general parameters of [MISC Serbia’s Kosovo  ] policy remain unchanged under the single-minded focus of Foreign Minister [PER Vuk Jeremic  ] and his [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] cohort. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The need to deal with the flow of problems stemming from Belgrade’s policy has cost us and the Kosovars . 
It opens the [LOC Kosovo  ] leadership to venomous opposition accusations that the government is not doing enough to establish its own authority in response to these [MISC Serbian  ] moves , particularly in [LOC Kosovo’s  ] north , and it distracts from the real requirements of responsible governance in [LOC Kosovo  ] -- expanding economic growth , eliminating corruption , and enhancing the transparency and effectiveness of major social institutions . 
Indeed , the north has become a proxy battleground for two differing visions of the region’s future: for [MISC Serbs  ] and for [LOC Belgrade  ] ( notably for President [PER Tadic  ] himself , who has spoken openly in the past of his thinking ) , it represents that part of [LOC Kosovo  ] most likely to be retained by [LOC Serbia  ] in a partition scenario as a precursor to [MISC Serbia’s  ] accession into the [ORG EU  ] , while for ethnic [MISC Albanians  ] in [LOC Kosovo  ] , retention of the north remains the symbolic key to proving [LOC Kosovo’s  ] legitimate sovereignty . 
The fragile [ORG EU  ] rule of law presence inserted triumphantly last December in the north and elsewhere in [LOC Kosovo  ] is no match for this political minefield , and we can expect regular ethnic confrontations -- with attendant casualties , including among international peacekeepers -- until such time as either side accepts the futility of its ultimate aims in the north. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) With close to 2000 [MISC EULEX  ] police , justice and customs functionaries in [LOC Kosovo  ] , the [ORG European Union  ] should have an overriding interest in a stable relationship between [LOC Kosovo  ] and [LOC Serbia  ] , and indeed recent months have seen an ongoing dialogue among [ORG EU  ] representatives and the governments in [LOC Pristina  ] and [LOC Belgrade  ] designed to press for practical progress on a variety of issues of importance to both sides . 
The talks , however , have limped along without much to show ; full resumption of customs operations on the northern border is months away , assuming [LOC Belgrade  ] ever gives the go-ahead , and [MISC Serb  ] police remain outside the [LOC Kosovo  ] Police structure in [LOC Kosovo’s  ] south despite ample time ( and full salaries paid by the [LOC Kosovo  ] government ) for their reabsorption . 
[ORG EU  ] visitors from [LOC Brussels  ] tell us that they “lack leverage” with [LOC Serbia  ] ( more accurately , they lack leverage with the five [ORG EU  ] states that do not recognize [LOC Kosovo  ] ) and , despite the obvious imperative of gaining Belgrade’s cooperation to ensure the success and momentum of the [MISC EULEX  ] mission , they seem to have [ORG PRISTINA  ] 00000183 002.2 OF 002 abandoned any attempt at real leadership to push for concessions . 
We can already sense a strong degree of “Kosovo-fatigue” among our [MISC European  ] counterparts which , coupled with the palpable sense here in the region that [LOC Europe  ] has given up on further expansion , could prove a bad combination in providing the necessary EU-inspired incentives for further advancement in [LOC Kosovo.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In the economic realm , [LOC Kosovo  ] must find a way to deal with its moribund and budget-consuming energy sector if it is to attract investment and avoid popular unrest due to rolling blackouts . 
International organizations and donors -- the [ORG World Bank  ] , the [ORG IMF  ] ( which [LOC Kosovo  ] will join after a successful board vote this May ) , the [ORG European Commission  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] and others -- must do a better job of coordination and providing effective guidance to the Kosovars , who lack the relevant experience and are often subject to mixed messages which do little to sketch out a clear way forward . 
The clearest example of this is in the energy arena , where the [ORG World Bank  ] has taken a position on the development of [LOC Kosovo’s  ] vast lignite deposits at odds with most of the other donors and stakeholders. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) All this , without question , makes continuing [MISC American  ] leadership and support to [LOC Kosovo  ] that much more imperative , in every sense possible -- political , technical and military . 
The need for KFOR to remain present in [LOC Kosovo  ] , especially in the north but in other mixed ethnic areas as well ( for example in [LOC Kosovo’s  ] east and south where [ORG USKFOR  ] has its area of responsibility and where the majority of [MISC Serbs  ] live ) , cannot be overstated . 
Recent moves by some allies to depart [LOC Kosovo  ] in a fashion uncoordinated through [ORG NATO  ] bode ill for KFOR’s future effectiveness ; that will be especially apparent if , as we anticipate , the [MISC French  ] downsize their presence in [LOC Mitrovica  ] and the north later this year. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [LOC Kosovo  ] is , thus far , a success story . 
Still , any of the factors we have enumerated -- continued [MISC Serbian  ] pressure , counter-productive reactions from volatile political elites in [LOC Kosovo  ] , [ORG EU  ] vacillation and weakness , mounting territorial-cum-political tensions in the north , premature [ORG NATO  ] withdrawal , or , maybe most serious , failure to secure a strong economic foundation for [LOC Kosovo’s  ] future -- could create obstacles to [LOC Kosovo’s  ] enduring survival . 
[LOC Kosovo  ] is looking to the [LOC United States  ] -- and to you , Mr. Vice President , as a known friend and long-time champion of human rights and dignity in the [LOC Balkans  ] -- to assert yet one more time ( and , yes , the continual reassurance is necessary under circumstances like those elaborated above ) that we will be here for the long run to help get [LOC Kosovo  ] through the difficult times ahead. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) But the quid pro quo , and one we must insist on with increased frequency and volume , is an acceptance of [LOC Kosovo’s  ] own responsibilities -- in governance , in outreach to its non-majority communities , and in getting beyond the provocations from [LOC Serbia  ] to focus on [LOC Kosovo’s  ] future . 
[LOC Kosovo  ] has been steeped in [MISC Serbia-related  ] mayhem for too long ; real maturity will come with the wisdom and ability to see beyond . 
You will carry this message in your meetings with leaders , in your address to the Assembly , and in your very appearance in [LOC Kosovo  ] at this critical time .
