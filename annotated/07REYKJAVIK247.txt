( C ) Summary: Exercise NORTHERN VIKING 2007 , held August 14-15 , was the first defense exercise conducted under our commitments set out in the bilateral [MISC Joint Understanding  ] of October <a id='par2006' href='#par2006'>¶</a>2006 . 
The successful exercise brought new positive attention to the [LOC U.S.  ] defense commitment to [LOC Iceland  ] as well as the future of the [LOC Iceland  ] Air Defense System ( [ORG IADS  ] ) radars . 
In meetings with USAFE Commander General Hobbins and Assistant Secretary of Defense Hall , both Prime Minister [PER Haarde  ] and Foreign Minister [PER Gisladottir  ] expressed their interest in continued bilateral engagement on defense , though some tension within the governing coalition on security issues was apparent . 
Adding to the focus on defense was the appearance on August 17 of six [MISC Russian  ] strategic bomber aircraft in the airspace around [LOC Iceland  ] , part of the resumption of strategic flights announced by [MISC Russian  ] President [PER Putin  ] . 
Wags and serious commentators alike have opined that the [MISC Russian  ] flights likely did more to ensure the long-term future of [ORG IADS  ] than the system 's proponents ever could have . 
End Summary . 
NORTHERN VIKING 2007 -------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) In the [MISC U.S.-Iceland Joint Understanding  ] signed in October 2006 , both countries pledged to hold at least one bilateral and/or multilateral exercise annually . 
NORTHERN VIKING 2007 ( NV07 ) , the first such exercise , was conducted on August 14-15 at [LOC Keflavik Airport  ] , using facilities located on the former site of [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Naval Air Station  ] [ORG Keflavik  ] ( [ORG NASKEF  ] ) . 
NV07 consisted of two non-integrated events running simultaneously: an air defense exercise and an anti-terror exercise . 
The purpose of this multinational training event was to exercise the air defense , anti-terror , and command and control capabilities of [ORG NATO  ] forces deploying to [LOC Iceland  ] . 
Participation included three [MISC USAF F-  ] 15C fighters and two [MISC USAF KC-135  ] refueling aircraft , two [MISC Norwegian  ] F-16 fighters and one [MISC Norwegian  ] P-3 aircraft , two [ORG NATO  ] AWACS aircraft , the [MISC Danish  ] Frigate " [ORG Triton  ] " with an embarked search-and-rescue ( SAR ) helicopter ) , SAR helicopter assets from the [ORG Icelandic Coast Guard  ] , special police forces from [LOC Iceland  ] and special forces personnel from [LOC Norway  ] , [LOC Denmark  ] , [LOC Sweden  ] and [LOC Latvia  ] . 
Representatives from the [LOC UK  ] , [ORG NATO  ] CAOC-1 , [ORG NATO  ] CAOC-3 , and the [MISC Norwegian  ] Joint [ORG AOC  ] observed the exercise . 
Additionally , USAFE Commander General Hobbins and Assistant Secretary of Defense for [ORG Reserve Affairs Hall SIPDIS  ] ( lead USG negotiator in defense talks with [LOC Iceland  ] in 2006 ) came to observe the event. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Participants'  ] and planners' comments to Post indicate that NV07 met its objectives completely , with exceptional weather allowing for maximal training opportunities for the participating aircrews . 
The Government of [LOC Iceland  ] also provided outstanding logistical support for the exercise , including jet fuel for [LOC U.S.  ] aircraft , messing and berthing for all participants , and smaller perks such as internet access and rental car transportation . 
Press coverage of [LOC NV07  ] was widespread and overwhelmingly favorable , though the Prime Minister 's [ORG Foreign Affairs Advisor  ] commented to Ambassador that he was disappointed with the [MISC Icelandic  ] press corps' very evident low level of knowledge of defense issues . 
PM , FM ask for help in selling [ORG IADS  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In the week leading up to [LOC NV07  ] , new Foreign Minister [PER Ingibjorg Gisladottir  ] had been a study in ambivalence , first indicating that she would be on leave during the exercise , then relenting and stating she would attend the exercise 's media events . 
In the end , she chose to meet with [ORG COMUSAFE  ] and Ambassador on the first morning of [LOC NV07  ] , and forgoing the public events . 
( Comment: Perhaps a concession to the pacifist wing of her party , which would be unsettled to see their party chair among uniforms and fighter jets . 
End comment . 
) In her meeting with General Hobbins , the FM , while appreciative of [LOC U.S.  ] participation in the exercise and [MISC U.S.-Iceland  ] cooperation on air policing at [ORG NATO  ] , pressed for Gen. Hobbins' views on the long-term future of the [LOC Iceland  ] Air Defense System ( [ORG IADS  ] ) . 
( Note: The USG ceased funding for [ORG IADS  ] on August 15 , 2007 . 
The [LOC MFA-  ] controlled [LOC Iceland  ] [ORG Radar Agency  ] now bears responsibility for operating the system , which was built with [ORG NATO  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] funds . 
End note . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Gisladottir  ] made clear her concern that after two weeks of skeptical , poorly-informed press articles on [ORG IADS  ] , the public perception was of an obsolete , overpriced system that the [LOC U.S.  ] no longer wanted . 
[ORG NATO  ] Military [ORG Committee  ] and [ORG North Atlantic Council  ] decisions that [ORG IADS  ] is necessary for [MISC Icelandic  ] and [MISC Alliance  ] air defense were helpful , she noted , but what are the real benefits of keeping the system operating ? 
[ORG COMUSAFE  ] observed that [ORG IADS  ] is necessary to give [ORG NATO  ] a complete airspace picture ; it also improves [MISC Icelandic  ] SAR capability , and adds stability to the transit of commercial air traffic. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Prime Minister [PER Geir Haarde  ] sounded similar notes in meeting with [ORG COMUSAFE  ] and [PER ASD Hall  ] later that day , while at the same time expressing greater confidence that [ORG IADS  ] would form an integral part of [LOC Iceland  ] 's defense policy and relationship with [ORG NATO  ] . 
[PER Haarde  ] pressed for the [LOC U.S.  ] to work with [LOC Iceland  ] to hold the NORTHERN VIKING exercise annually , though taking on board General Hobbins' point that the exercise does not necessarily need to include an air force component in every iteration . 
[PER Haarde  ] agreed that the exercise was a useful demonstration of [MISC IADS-AWACS  ] integration , and also applauded the [ORG NAC  ] approval of an air policing plan for [LOC Iceland  ] . 
He said the government planned to continue talks on defense and security agreements with neighbors , and pointed to the recent [LOC MOU  ] with [LOC Norway  ] ( which he happily noted was an active NV07 participant ) . 
Next on the agenda in this regard are [LOC Canada  ] and the [LOC UK.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Noting that it was nearly a year since the [ORG NASKEF  ] closure , [PER Haarde  ] commented that no one could have foreseen how well things have turned out . 
Progress in developing portions of the base into student housing and a university-level education and research center is impressive . 
[PER ASD Hall  ] agreed that the transition had gone very well and complimented the Prime Minister on his government 's management of the issue . 
Looking beyond [LOC Iceland  ] 's borders , PM [PER Haarde  ] asked [ORG COMUSAFE  ] what he thought of recent increases in [MISC Russian  ] air activity such as the August bomber sorties near [LOC Guam  ] and activity in the [ORG North Atlantic  ] earlier this year . 
General Hobbins noted that there is a strong political component to the [MISC Russians'  ] moves in this regard . 
The [MISC Russians  ] come back ---------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) PM [PER Haarde  ] 's question took on new meaning several days later , as six [MISC Russian  ] strategic bomber aircraft participating in long range operations on August 17 entered the Military Air Defense Identification Zone ( [ORG MADIZ  ] ) surrounding [LOC Iceland  ] . 
The [MISC Icelandic  ] Government was in contact with counterpart units in [LOC Norway  ] and the [LOC UK  ] throughout the incident and was able to track the aircraft through [ORG IADS  ] . 
Beginning at 0200 [MISC GMT  ] , the first ( two [MISC Tu-160  ] Blackjacks ) and second sorties ( two [ORG Tu-95 Bears  ] ) both passed through the [ORG MADIZ  ] to the east of [LOC Iceland  ] , while the third sortie ( also of two [ORG Bears  ] ) circumnavigated [LOC Iceland  ] , at one point coming within 9 nautical miles of [LOC Keflavik  ] . 
While the incident was occurring , MFA and [ORG Radar Agency  ] representatives asked Post 's Assistant to the Defense Attache ( [PER A/DATT  ] ) to come to the [ORG IADS Command and Reporting Center  ] , where [PER A/DATT  ] observed the third sortie 's flight as well as its intercept by [MISC British  ] and [MISC Norwegian  ] fighters . 
A near-gleeful [ORG Radar Agency  ] representative turned to [PER A/DATT  ] at one point and said , " See how important this system is ? 
" <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Both cynical and serious observers have made similar points in recent days , as the consensus has developed that [MISC Russian  ] President [PER Putin  ] 's announcement of resumed strategic bomber flights could not have come at a better time for a government looking to justify spending at least $12.5 million a year to operate [ORG IADS  ] , plus significant annual expenditures for military exercises . 
While downplaying the significance of the [MISC Russian  ] flights by saying they would have no impact on [MISC Russian-Icelandic  ] relations , FM [PER Gisladottir  ] did take the opportunity to note to the press that [ORG IADS  ] had been necessary to track the planes in order to ensure civil aviation safety over [LOC Iceland  ] . 
Comment ------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) NV07 was of key importance to demonstrate that the [LOC U.S.  ] takes the commitments we made in 2006 seriously: we and the rest of [ORG NATO  ] are ready and able to defend [LOC Iceland  ] without permanently basing forces here . 
However , the exercise also cast further light on the Foreign Minister 's struggle to balance her party 's standoffish position on military matters with the obligations of her new job which includes managing defense issues. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) While [MISC Russian  ] air activity may have been a godsend for those wishing to ensure IADS' future , Post also expects an uptick in " we told you so " comments from those who believed the [ORG NASKEF  ] closure jeopardized [LOC Iceland  ] 's security . 
In this event , swift coordination with [ORG NATO  ] counterparts in [LOC Norway  ] and the [LOC UK  ] ensured that the [MISC Icelandic  ] government was never in the dark , and make a strong case for [ORG NATO  ] 's ability to respond expeditiously on [LOC Iceland  ] 's behalf . 
We will continue to urge [LOC Iceland  ] to build its information and intelligence-sharing networks within [ORG NATO  ] in order to ensure [ORG NATO  ] retains this capability. van Voorst</pre></code>
