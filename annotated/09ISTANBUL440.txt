( C ) Recent discussions with [MISC Turkish  ] and [MISC Iranian  ] think-tank , business , and political activist contacts on the issue of [MISC Turkey-Iran  ] relations reveal a broad consensus that: ( 1 ) [LOC Turkey  ] pursues closer relations with [LOC Iran  ] out of desires for regional stability and conflict avoidance , recognition of [LOC Turkey  ] as an indispensable East-West bridge ; strengthening a long-term energy and commercial relationship ; and hope that [LOC Turkey  ] 's approach will moderate [MISC Iranian  ] regime behavior . 
( 2 ) [LOC Iran  ] reciprocates because it sees [LOC Turkey  ] as a hedge against its diplomatic isolation , a buffer against sanctions , and a safety valve for its population . 
However , ( 3 ) [LOC Turkey  ] 's influence over [MISC Iranian  ] decision-making it limited ; [LOC Turkey  ] has never persuaded [LOC Iran  ] to change course on an issue of strategic concern to the regime . 
To quote one contact: " [LOC Iran  ] knows [LOC Turkey  ] is not going to walk away . 
" On the other hand , our contacts also concluded that [MISC Iranian  ] decision-making responds at least tactically to multilateral pressure , which argues that [LOC Turkey  ] can and should play a key role to play in supporting tougher approaches on [LOC Iran  ] at the [ORG UNSC  ] and [ORG IAEA  ] . 
End Summary . 
Views from Contacts on [MISC Turkey-Iran Relations  ] --------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Over the past several weeks , in conversations before and after President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's November 8-9 visit to [LOC Istanbul  ] ( ref B ) , [ORG ConGen Istanbul  ] 's [ORG NEA Iran Watcher  ] has solicited views from a wide range of [MISC Turkish  ] and [MISC Iranian  ] contacts on the issue of warming [MISC Turkey-Iran  ] relations , what motivates each side , and whether [LOC Turkey  ] 's approach has led to a moderation of [MISC Iranian  ] regime behavior . 
Contacts with whom we spoke included [MISC Turkish  ] academic experts , [MISC Turkish  ] businessmen who deal with [LOC Iran  ] , [MISC Istanbul-based  ] journalists who cover [LOC Iran  ] , several [MISC Iranian  ] political activists now seeking refugee status in [LOC Turkey  ] for fear of persecution in [LOC Iran  ] , and several Tehran-based [MISC Iranian  ] contacts who follow [LOC Iran  ] 's foreign policy . 
Our conversations revealed an unusual confluence of views . 
[LOC Turkey  ] 's Motivations -------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) According to a number of [MISC Turkish  ] academic and think-tank contacts , [LOC Turkey  ] is pursuing closer relations with [LOC Iran  ] for several mutually-reinforcing reasons . 
First , the underlying principle: According to a [MISC Turkish  ] university professor who informally advises FM [PER Davutoglu  ] on [LOC Middle East  ] issues ( ref C ) , [LOC Turkey  ] 's pursuit of close relations with [LOC Iran  ] is a direct reflection of [PER Davutoglu  ] 's academic philosophy and influential 2000 book , " [ORG Strategic Depth  ] , " in which he first articulated a policy of " zero problems " with [LOC Turkey  ] 's neighbors . 
Another [MISC Istanbul-based  ] professor told us that [LOC Turkey  ] 's [LOC Iran  ] policy represents " a triumph of real-politik , " with [LOC Turkey  ] 's national and regional interests trumping any discomfort that [LOC Turkey  ] , as a multi-ethnic , pluralistic democracy , might feel about the [MISC Iranian  ] regime 's harsh domestic authoritarianism . 
This contact described [PER Davutoglu  ] as " [LOC Turkey  ] 's [PER Kissinger  ] . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Regional Stability and Conflict Avoidance: [MISC Turkish  ] contacts , and indeed even MFA interlocutors , have acknowledged in the recent past that [LOC Turkey  ] sees a military attack against [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear facilities as the worst possible outcome on the [LOC Iran  ] issue . 
[LOC Iran  ] 's acquisition of a nuclear weapons capability would only be the second worst outcome . 
This hints at the depth of [LOC Turkey  ] 's anxiety about the dangers to regional stability , including [LOC Turkey  ] 's , of the unintended consequences of any further military action in the region , and explains [LOC Turkey  ] 's commitment at almost any cost to continued western diplomatic engagement with [LOC Iran  ] . 
As one contact explained , " After the traumatic violence in [LOC Iraq  ] , and fearful that some countries still think military action is an option with [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] will do anything to prevent armed conflict . 
" The [ORG GoT  ] 's approach on this score enjoys some public support: [MISC Turkish  ] public opinion also considers an attack against [LOC Iran  ] as more dangerous to [LOC Turkey  ] than [LOC Iran  ] acquiring a nuclear weapons capability . 
Indeed , almost a third of [LOC Turks  ] polled do not consider a nuclear-armed [LOC Iran  ] to be a threat , believing that [LOC Iran  ] would never attack a fellow [MISC Muslim  ] country. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Recognition of [LOC Turkey  ] as Moderate Regional Leader and Indispensable East-West Bridge: According to an [MISC Ankara-based  ] [ORG ISTANBUL  ] 00000440 002 OF 004 international relations professor with ties to PM [PER Erdogan  ] 's office , [LOC Turkey  ] is also deepening ties to [LOC Iran  ] because the region otherwise faces a " power vacuum . 
" No other regional state ( e.g . 
[LOC Egypt  ] , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] ) has the military and economic power to serve as an effective counterweight to [LOC Iran  ] . 
[LOC Turkey  ] fills this role with the support of regional states who otherwise fear a dominant [LOC Iran  ] , including the [ORG Gulf States  ] and to some degree [LOC Iran  ] 's own client , [LOC Syria  ] . 
Moreover , he described [LOC Turkey  ] 's engagement with [LOC Iran  ] as part of a wider effort to stake out a regional leadership position that puts [LOC Turkey  ] " at the fulcrum " and makes it an indispensable partner for the west -- whether or not [LOC Turkey  ] eventually joins the [ORG EU  ] -- in dealing with the [LOC Middle East  ] and [LOC Central Asia  ] . 
This contact acknowledged that this sometimes requires [LOC Turkey  ] to tactically distance itself from the [ORG USG  ] on several key issues , including [LOC Iran  ] 's " right " to enrichment and the regime 's dismal human rights record . 
But our contact underscored that " this is classic triangulation . 
" [LOC Turkey  ] 's intention , he claims , is not a strategic distancing from the [LOC US.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Strengthening a long-term energy and commercial relationship: [LOC Turkey  ] does not hide the fact that its own growing energy security needs compel it to look to all available sources , including [LOC Iran  ] , for energy . 
In response , we have underscored that the [ORG USG  ] supports the diversification of [MISC Turkish  ] gas supplies , while cautioning that [LOC Iran  ] has proven to be an unreliable partner in the past and reaffirming [ORG USG  ] concern over new energy deals with [LOC Iran  ] . 
[LOC Turkey  ] is also actively seeking to expand trade ties with [MISC Iran: Both  ] [MISC Turkish  ] and [MISC Iranian  ] officials have publicly called for bilateral trade volume , which was $10 billion in 2008 , to reach $20 billion by 2012 -- a goal most trade experts say is wildly unrealistic . 
Furthermore , [LOC Turkey  ] is taking steps to protect and expand financial ties with [LOC Iran  ] , for example by continuing to allow [LOC Iran  ] 's [ORG Bank Mellat  ] ( sanctioned by the [ORG USG  ] under E.O. 13382 ) to operate branches in [LOC Istanbul  ] and [LOC Ankara  ] , and agreeing to conduct bilateral trade in [MISC Turkish  ] Lira or [MISC Iranian  ] Rials rather than dollars and [MISC Euros  ] to avoid having to clear the payments through [LOC US  ] or [MISC European  ] banks. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Tying [LOC Iran  ] into regional organizations: As long as [PER Davutoglu  ] controls [MISC Turkish  ] foreign policy , our [MISC Turkish  ] contacts predict that [LOC Ankara  ] will seek multiple avenues for bilateral and multilateral engagement with [LOC Iran  ] , deepening bilateral cultural and economic ties , and working with regional organizations like the [MISC D-8  ] ( ref D ) , the [ORG Economic Cooperation Organization  ] ( ref E ) and the [ORG OIC  ] to maximize engagement . 
Indeed , [PER Davutoglu  ] 's MFA sees regional IOs like these as much more useful tools for engaging [LOC Iran  ] , and thus committing [LOC Iran  ] incrementally to pursue regionally cooperative policies , than previous FMs did , according to contacts . 
[LOC Iran  ] 's Motivations ------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) According to our [MISC Turkish  ] and [MISC Iranian  ] contacts , [LOC Iran  ] is happy to reciprocate [LOC Turkey  ] 's interest in closer ties because it sees [LOC Turkey  ] as a hedge against its diplomatic isolation , a buffer against sanctions , and a safety valve for its population . 
[LOC Turkey  ] 's value to [LOC Iran  ] is felt most strongly in these six areas: --Economic: [LOC Iran  ] recognizes [LOC Turkey  ] 's emergence as a regional economic powerhouse , wants to deepen [LOC Turkey  ] 's dependence on its natural gas , and sees [MISC Turkish  ] markets and bilateral commerce as a hedge against isolation and sanctions ; -- [ORG Diplomatic: Iran  ] knows that [LOC Turkey  ] 's seats on the [ORG UNSC  ] and [ORG IAEA  ] Board give it outsized influence , and [LOC Iran  ] benefits from the occasional inclination of [MISC Turkish  ] leaders to give [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear intentions , at least in public , the benefit of the doubt ; -- Political: [LOC Turkey  ] 's refusal to publicly criticize the regime over the conduct of June elections or its crackdown on peaceful protesters , as well as PM Edogan 's quick recognition of [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's contested election victory , helped bolster [MISC Iranian  ] regime legitimacy at a critical period when the regime needed it most ; -- Cultural: A quarter of [LOC Iran  ] 's population is ethnically [MISC Azeri  ] and Turkish-speaking ; [MISC Turkish  ] TV programs and are among the most popular in [LOC Iran  ] ; and one million [MISC Iranians  ] flock annually visa-free to [LOC Turkey  ] as a touristic " safety valve " ; -- [LOC Turkey  ] 's strategic importance to the [ORG U.S: Iran  ] closely watched the spring 2009 visits to [LOC Turkey  ] by Secretary [PER Clinton  ] and then President [PER Obama  ] . 
One direct result of those visits , according to an [MISC Iranian  ] journalist based in [LOC Istanbul  ] , was a decision by the regime to try to use [LOC Turkey  ] 's enhanced influence with the [ORG USG  ] to " soften " [LOC Washington  ] 's approach to [LOC Iran  ] . 
[LOC ISTANBUL  ] 00000440 003 OF 004 The Limits of [MISC Turkish Influence On  ] [LOC Iran  ] --------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [LOC Turkey  ] 's influence with [LOC Iran  ] runs broadly , but does not appear to run deep . 
None of our contacts had seen concrete evidence that [LOC Turkey  ] has swayed [MISC Iranian  ] leaders to change course on any issue of strategic interest to the regime where [LOC Iran  ] had not already calculated it was in its interests to do so. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) An [MISC Istanbul-based  ] professor who informally advises [PER Davutoglu  ] , and joined him in his September and October bilats ( in [LOC Tehran  ] and [LOC Kuala Lumpur  ] ) with [MISC Iranian  ] FM [MISC Mottaki  ] , claimed that [PER Davutoglu  ] 's interventions helped persuade the regime to agree to participate in the October 1 [LOC Geneva  ] meeting with the [ORG P5  ] 1 . 
However , all other contacts dismissed that claim , noting that [MISC Iranian  ] regime statements and press reports prior to [PER Davutoglu  ] 's bilats already indicated that [LOC Iran  ] would go to [ORG Geneva.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Several weeks of intense , personal diplomacy by FM [PER Davutoglu  ] , supported by interventions form President [PER Gul  ] and PM [PER Erdogan  ] , have been unable to persuade [MISC Iranian  ] decision-makers to agree to a compromise deal with [LOC Turkey  ] that would keep alive the [ORG IAEA  ] 's [ORG Tehran Research Reactor  ] ( [ORG TRR  ] ) fuel swap proposal , a key test of the [ORG P5  ] 1 's efforts to engage [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Our contact who advises [PER Davutoglu  ] also asserted that [LOC Turkey  ] played a key role in persuading [LOC Iran  ] to release several detainees including [MISC Greek-British  ] journalist [PER Iason Athanasiadis  ] ( jailed in [LOC Iran  ] on June 17 and released on July 6 ) . 
But [PER Athanasiadis  ] ( please protect ) told us that while [LOC Turkey  ] offered to intervene with [LOC Iran  ] on his case , to his knowledge it never did , and indeed [PER Athanasiadis  ] told us he believed it was the [ORG Ecumenical Patriarch  ] 's personal request to [PER Khamenei  ] ( via letter ) that probably convinced [LOC Iran  ] to release him. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Even on issues of lesser strategic importance to [LOC Iran  ] , high-level [MISC Turkish  ] intervention does not reveal a record of successfully moderating [MISC Iranian  ] policies . 
According to a [MISC Turkish  ] businessman who deals with [LOC Iran  ] ( Ref F ) , several interventions from [LOC Turkey  ] 's Trade and Foreign Ministers , and even a plea from PM [PER Erdogan  ] in [LOC Tehran  ] on October 27 , have been unable to persuade [LOC Iran  ] to lower its customs duties on [MISC Turkish  ] imports , currently 45% for finished products . 
As our business contact explained , even though [LOC Iran  ] depends on [MISC Turkish  ] diplomatic support and benefits from [MISC Turkish  ] gas purchases and other trade , [LOC Iran  ] realizes it does not have to sacrifice any critical policy priorities in return , including its customs income , because " [LOC Iran  ] knows [LOC Turkey  ] is not going to walk away . 
" Does [ORG Turkey Really Understand Iran Better  ] ? --------------------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Underlying [LOC Turkey  ] 's pursuit of warmer relations with [LOC Iran  ] is an assumption on the part of [MISC Turkish  ] decision-makers and diplomats that [LOC Turkey  ] has correctly judged that the current [MISC Iranian  ] regime will be its long-term interlocutor . 
But [LOC Turkey  ] 's belief that it understands [MISC Iranian  ] political developments better than most western countries is an assumption strongly challenged by our [MISC Iranian  ] contacts . 
These contacts suggest that [LOC Turkey  ] draws its assessment of [LOC Iran  ] 's internal dynamics through a subjective filter , which values regime stability foremost , and thus [LOC Turkey  ] 's assessments artificially inflate evidence suggestive of regime stability. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) According to two separate " [ORG Green Movement  ] " activists now seeking refugee status in [LOC Turkey  ] -- one a [PER Mousavi  ] campaign official , one the communications director of a reformist party that supported [MISC Mousavi  ] -- [LOC Turkey  ] missed an historic opportunity by quickly recognizing [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's victory and dismissing the [ORG Green Movement  ] 's political significance , either as a meaningful opposition movement or as the possible vanguard of a more democratic [MISC Iranian  ] government . 
Most [ORG Green Movement  ] activists now see [LOC Turkey  ] as fully committed to the [MISC Iranian  ] regime 's survival in the name of regional stability , and predict that [LOC Turkey  ] will be " on the wrong side of history " if and when [LOC Iran  ] 's fractured regime faces systemic change at the hands of [LOC Iran  ] 's population . 
" When the system falls and a more democratic , moderate , outward-looking government comes to power , we will all remember where [LOC Turkey  ] stood on 22 Khordad ( June 12 ) and after . 
" <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [LOC Turkey  ] , like the [ORG USG  ] , almost certainly recognizes that within the [MISC Iranian  ] regime there are at least several factions and key players jockeying intensely for influence . 
[LOC ISTANBUL  ] 00000440 004 OF 004 The fact that [MISC Turkish  ] President [PER Gul  ] agreed to meet former [MISC Iranian  ] presidential candidate [PER Mohsen Rezai  ] , a [MISC Rafsanjani  ] ally , in [LOC Ankara  ] in October ( despite the [ORG INTERPOL  ] Red Notice issued against [PER Rezai  ] ) , and the relative frequency with which [MISC Turkish  ] officials including PM [PER Erdogan  ] have met influential [ORG Majles  ] speaker [ORG Larijani  ] , an [PER Ahmadinejad  ] rival , in the past six months , suggest that [LOC Turkey  ] -- like others in the west -- wants to hedge its bets on who will emerge as the strongest of [LOC Iran  ] 's decision-makers , especially if Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] faces future leadership challenges . 
( In a telling anecdote related to us indirectly , when [PER Erdogan  ] met [PER Khamenei  ] in [LOC Tehran  ] on October 28 , [PER Khamenei  ] seemed to be " in a time capsule " , asking uninformed or unrealistic questions about [MISC Turkish  ] foreign policy , and passively uninterested in discussing the nuclear issue . 
) Despite its belief that it knows its neighbor [LOC Iran  ] better than most other countries do , according to our contacts , [LOC Turkey  ] is just as uncertain as the [ORG USG  ] and other western countries as to what exactly is happening behind the regime 's closed doors . 
Implications ---------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) If the consensus views of our contacts are accurate , it suggests our efforts to persuade PM [PER Erdogan  ] to adopt a tougher public stance against [LOC Iran  ] will be a tough sell . 
Even if [PER Erdogan  ] were to hew closer to P5-plus-one criticism of [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Tehran  ] would likely pay him little heed . 
On the other hand , our contacts point out that [LOC Iran  ] 's regime has a clear recent history of making tactical concessions in the face of concerted international pressure , especially pressure from the [ORG UNSC  ] and [ORG IAEA  ] . 
If this holds true , we can and should encourage [LOC Turkey  ] to play a supportive role at the [ORG UNSC  ] and [ORG IAEA  ] as the [ORG USG  ] and partners consider raising pressure on [LOC Iran  ] in those fora . 
As noted Ref G , however , any [ORG USG  ] effort to try press [LOC Turkey  ] to sign up to tougher international measures on [LOC Iran  ] , especially on issues that might impact the [MISC Turkish  ] economy , will have costly domestic political consequences for the GoT . 
The key to securing [MISC Turkish  ] acquiescence at the [ORG UNSC  ] and [ORG IAEA  ] , a [MISC Turkish  ] professor explained , is to keep the engagement track on the table and even further sweetened ( especially with trade incentives from which [LOC Turkey  ] might also benefit ) , even as tougher measures are being pursued .
