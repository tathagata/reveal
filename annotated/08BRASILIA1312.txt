Liston  ] , reasons 1.4 b and d. <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) PolCouns delivered the demarche on September 24 to Minister [PER Marcos Pinta Gama  ] in the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] 's [ORG General Secretariat of Foreign Relations  ] , and [ORG Poloff  ] delivered it on September 29 to First Secretary [PER Marisa Kenicke  ] , the [LOC Afghanistan  ] desk officer . 
[PER Pinta Gama  ] noted that [LOC Brazil  ] had attended an earlier donor conference on [LOC Afghanistan  ] and was considering ways in which it might be helpful . 
Up to this point , [LOC Brazil  ] has looked for development-related projects rather than support for the military , however . 
So far , the [ORG GOB  ] has not found feasible opportunities for supporting [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Kenicke  ] received the demarche without substantive comment and reported October 1 that there was still no official response. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [LOC Brazil  ] 's track record suggests that it would be precedent-breaking for [LOC Brazil  ] to support a foreign military force outside of a [ORG UN  ] system mechanism , within which the [ORG GOB  ] strongly prefers to work . 
The request of five million dollars over five years is far larger than many other requests we have made which have gone unanswered . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's resources for assistance in general are extremely limited , and the [ORG GOB  ] tends to prefer technical assistance for social development projects .
