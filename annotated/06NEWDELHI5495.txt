Mrs. [PER Gandhi  ] demonstrated a strong commitment to a progressive left-of-center agenda aimed at combating socially conservative forces bent on oppressing [MISC Indian  ] women . 
However , she was also realistic , revealing an in-depth knowledge of [MISC Indian  ] culture , especially the rural/urban divide . 
At times suppressing her emotions , she spoke about the compulsions of political life , her parents’ objections to her marriage to [PER Rajiv Gandhi  ] and the sacrifices she and her family have made . 
Her comments and demeanor put the lie to cocktail party suggestions that she courts [PER Manmohan Singh’s  ] job . 
End Summary . 
Two Dynasties Meet ------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Maria Shriver  ] , California’s first lady and wife of Governor [PER Arnold Schwarzenegger  ] , met with [ORG Congress Party  ] President [PER Sonia Gandhi  ] on August 3 as part of her official visit to [LOC India  ] . 
[PER Shriver  ] is in [LOC India  ] to discuss her various initiatives on women’s’ affairs and to solicit [MISC Indian  ] involvement . 
She is also laying the groundwork for a proposed trade mission led by Governor [PER Schwarzenegger  ] around February , 2007 . 
After her stay in [LOC Delhi  ] , she will go to [LOC Dharamshalla  ] to meet the [PER Dalai Lama  ] . 
In addition to the [PER Gandhi  ] meeting , [PER Shriver  ] met with the head of the [ORG National Commission for Women  ] and toured [MISC NGO’s  ] involved in women’s’ affairs . 
Mrs. [PER Gandhi  ] was accompanied by former Cabinet Minister [PER Karan Singh  ] . 
[ORG Indian Women Bear  ] a Heavy Burden -------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Shriver  ] and [PER Gandhi  ] engaged in an over one hour exchange that was lively and open and covered many issues , both personal and political . 
[PER Shriver  ] explained that she was concerned with women’s issues , including sexual abuse and exploitation and trafficking . 
Mrs. [PER Gandhi  ] replied that the situation for women in [LOC India  ] is more troubling and traumatic than that in the [LOC US  ] and other developed countries , as [MISC Indian  ] women must deal with myriad problems not found in the west , such as child labor . 
In addition , most [MISC Indian  ] women live in remote villages with severe “cultural compulsions” that work against women , making it difficult for the [MISC GOI  ] to enforce the law . 
She pointed out that [MISC Indian  ] women remain largely uneducated which is a “big problem” for [MISC Indian  ] society and makes progress difficult . 
This compels the [MISC GOI  ] to rely on television and radio to reach women with messages aimed at their concerns . 
Mrs. [PER Gandhi  ] noted that while she had a deep personal interest in women’s’ issues , she “only rarely” gave personal interviews aimed at female audiences . 
And [PER Sonia Bears  ] a Personal Burden --------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Without prompting and at her own initiative Mrs. [PER Gandhi  ] then spoke at length about her personal life . 
She revealed that after her mother in law’s murder [PER Rajiv Gandhi  ] was under intense pressure to take up the political mantle of the [PER Gandhi  ] family , but both [PER Rajiv  ] and [PER Sonia  ] were intensely NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00005495 002 OF 005 personal and had no interest in politics . 
According to Mrs. [PER Gandhi  ] , she urged her husband repeatedly to avoid politics , but he insisted . 
After [PER Rajiv Gandhi  ] became Prime Minister , [PER Sonia  ] was determined to avoid the limelight and “kept in the background.” She clarified that she accompanied her husband to official events , but refrained from making political statements . 
After her husband’s assassination , [PER Mrs. Gandhi  ] withdrew , working only on a charitable foundation established in [LOC Rajiv’s  ] memory . 
In a candid revelation of her personal political stance , [PER Mrs. Gandhi  ] stated that “the right was becoming strong in [LOC India  ] and [ORG Congress  ] weak , ” tipping her hand and “compelling” her to enter politics to protect the [PER Gandhi  ] family legacy . 
She also revealed that her children were “not keen” about the idea , but eventually told her , “whatever you decide , we will back you.” Turning Down the PM Spot ------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Mrs. Gandhi  ] was reluctant to provide details regarding her decision to turn down the Prime Minister post after the UPA’s surprise 2004 electoral victory , stating that “I am often asked about this , but tell people that I will write a book someday with the whole story.” She would only say that she “felt better” that someone else became PM and “did not regret” her decision . 
[PER Shriver  ] congratulated [PER Mrs. Gandhi  ] for her resoluteness and described her as “courageous.” Clearly embarrassed by this adulation , [PER Mrs. Gandhi  ] made no response . 
She elaborated , at [PER Karan Singh’s  ] insistence , saying that she was under lots of pressure , as the “party workers” were “very upset.” They “could not understand” why she , as party President , was not taking up the post , since they had voted for her and won a majority . 
Politics and Women ------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Shriver  ] noted that she chairs a “Women’s Conference” that brings 11,000 women to [LOC California  ] to discuss relevant issues , and reinforced the point that “women can change the world.” [PER Shriver  ] invited Mrs. [PER Gandhi  ] to attend next year . 
She pointed out that last year’s keynote speaker was [PER Sandra Day O’Connor  ] , who spoke about balancing public and private life , and how she left the [ORG Supreme Court  ] to look after her ailing husband and spend more time with her children . 
[PER Shriver  ] emphasized that [PER Justice O’Connor  ] also did not want to enter public life but was “pushed by her husband , ” and noted how difficult it is to be a wife and mother and play a public role . 
[PER Mrs. Gandhi  ] made no commitment to attend . 
[MISC Indian  ] Steps to Bring Justice ----------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Mrs. [PER Gandhi  ] explained the steps that her [ORG UPA  ] government had taken and planned to take to help women achieve greater social mobility and rights . 
She explained that the [MISC GOI  ] had instituted a “Panchayati Raj” program under which major decisions regarding the economic development of villages are made by [ORG Panchayats  ] ( village councils ) . 
To ensure female participation , [PER Rajiv Gandhi  ] had “reserved” 33 percent of the positions on the [ORG Panchayats  ] for women . 
Although there were “some complaints” that the women were “manipulated by their husbands , ” Mrs. [PER Gandhi  ] asserted that “research had confirmed that women will invariably take the right decisions.” She noted that the [ORG UPA  ] now wants to extend the same reservations to Parliament and the [ORG Legislative  ] NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00005495 003 OF 005 Assemblies . 
Mrs. [PER Gandhi  ] confirmed that currently the number of female MPs was “very small , ” as “some parties believe that women should not be in power.” The [MISC Indian  ] Contradiction ------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Shriver  ] pointed out that her trip had made her aware of the “great contradiction” between a society in which women occupied many leadership positions , including , at times , Prime Minister , ” but still were denied many basic rights . 
Mrs. [PER Gandhi  ] agreed with [PER Shriver  ] , noting that several [MISC Indian  ] states had female Chief Ministers , and that an increasing numbers of [MISC Indian  ] women are [MISC CEOs  ] of major corporations , doctors , and scientists , and “we will keep fighting.” She explained that the situation for women varied from state to state , and that [LOC South India  ] was “more progressive” than the [LOC North  ] for various historical and cultural reasons , and that , for example , the state of [LOC Kerala  ] supplied nurses to much of the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
Possible [MISC Indian  ] Collaboration ----------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Praising the contribution of [MISC Indians  ] and [MISC Indian-Americans  ] to [LOC California  ] , [PER Shriver  ] suggested that perhaps the [MISC GOI  ] could help the state government combat its teacher and nursing shortage . 
She also noted that her family is very involved in the Special [MISC Olympics  ] program and would like 500,000 participants for the [MISC Indian  ] Special [MISC Olympics  ] and hoped that Mrs. [PER Gandhi  ] would attend the events scheduled for November 6 . 
Mrs. [PER Shriver  ] pointed out that those with intellectual disabilities were making great strides in the [LOC US  ] , with many becoming self sufficient . 
This is necessary , she pointed out , “as we do not have the relevant institutions in the [MISC US.”  ] [PER Mrs. Gandhi  ] conceded that [MISC Indian  ] government institutions for the intellectually disabled are “nothing to write home about , ” leaving parents and [ORG NGOs  ] to deal with the problem , and that in rural areas , such children are “often hidden” and their disability “kept secret.” Slow Social Change ------------------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Mrs. [PER Gandhi  ] was not the least defensive about the gravity of [MISC India’s  ] social problems . 
When asked by [PER Shriver  ] about adoption , she noted that adoptions remained rare in [LOC India  ] and most [MISC Indians  ] continued to “see nothing wrong” in that . 
It is a “happy change , ” however , that more families are taking in orphans . 
She readily agreed with [PER Shriver  ] that many [MISC Indians  ] still considered female children as “a problem” and preferred males and , as a result , more girls are abandoned than boys . 
[PER Mrs. Gandhi  ] reiterated that “education is the key to change” as much legislation is not enforced . 
This makes it necessary to “convince families and make them understand” to bring about positive change . 
Personal Insights Into an Active Life ------------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Mrs. [PER Gandhi  ] then provided personal insights into her life , saying that she travels constantly all over [LOC India  ] , often to remote areas to visit the common people , as “it is only by going out and interacting with people that we are in a better position to understand their problems and determine what they want.” She confided that there has been a big NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00005495 004 OF 005 change in the [MISC Indian  ] mindset regarding education . 
Earlier , parents were not very interested in ensuring their children were educated , while today , “99 percent want to send their children to school.” Everywhere you go in [LOC India  ] today , she noted , you see children in their uniforms heading for school , and this is “something that makes us happy.” In addition to education , [MISC Indian  ] parents want their children to have access to basic health care - “doctors and medicines , ” and some assurance that they will have a job after they complete their education . 
Mrs. [PER Gandhi  ] worried that there will be huge numbers of young [MISC Indians  ] leaving school with no guarantee of finding a job . 
Population Control Off the Screen --------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Mrs. [PER Gandhi  ] pointed out that “population control” is a political taboo in [LOC India  ] after [PER Indira Gandhi  ] was voted out of office over this issue . 
Although she insisted allegations of forced vasectomies and other abuses were “highly exaggerated” and “politically motivated , ” the historical memory has forced the [ORG UPA  ] to focus on raising awareness and providing basic health services and means that progress on reducing the birth rate will be “slow.” Again , education will be the key , as demonstrated by the small family norm in urban areas . 
Culture and Fighting [MISC AIDS  ] ------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Karan Singh  ] pointed out that population reduction and [MISC AIDS  ] control are linked as it requires condom distribution to combat both problems . 
Mrs. [PER Gandhi  ] pointed out that [ORG Northeast India  ] faces a severe [MISC AIDS  ] problem , as it is a transshipment point for narcotics with a growing drug problem . 
Cultural factors also inhibit [MISC AIDS  ] control , as the government “cannot be open” with condom distribution because of “certain mindsets.” This compels the [MISC GOI  ] to find an “appropriate way” to communicate with the population . 
[PER Shriver  ] responded that the [LOC US  ] , as a multicultural society , faces many of the same problems , as men from some cultural backgrounds “don’t want anything to do” with family planning and [MISC AIDS  ] prevention . 
The key , she emphasized , was “empowering women to demand action on these issues.” [LOC India  ] and the [LOC US  ] ---------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Shriver  ] observed that there was “no anti-Americanism” in [LOC India  ] and that [MISC Indians  ] from diverse backgrounds , cultures and religions have successfully found ways to coexist . 
Mrs. [PER Gandhi  ] replied that [MISC Indians  ] are “inherently tolerant” as they have co-existed for centuries . 
[PER Karan Singh  ] added that the “freedom movement of [LOC Mahatma Gandhi”  ] also played a crucial role as it was inclusive , pluralistic and emphasized that multiplicity of [MISC Indian  ] culture . 
Mrs. [PER Gandhi  ] jokingly pointed out that the “Indian Left is anti-American , ” but then agreed that its stance was aimed at “American policy” rather than the [MISC American  ] people . 
[PER Karan Singh  ] emphasized that he and “most Indians” objected to many aspects of current [MISC American  ] policy but held no brief against the [MISC American  ] people . 
Mrs. [PER Gandhi  ] also pointed out that many [MISC Indian  ] Muslims “resent certain policies of the [ORG US.” More Personal Revelations  ] NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00005495 005 OF 005 ------------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Mrs. [PER Gandhi  ] revealed that her own parents objected to her marriage to [PER Rajiv Gandhi  ] and she “resented their position” and went ahead and married him anyway . 
She also noted that she felt that her gender has never been an issue in her political life and that [PER Indira Gandhi  ] also made the same observation . 
In [LOC Hinduism  ] , “women are seen as goddesses and no puja ( worship ) can take place without them , ” while , ironically , oppression of women is common . 
She also revealed that common women in [MISC India’s  ] rural areas do not hold her in great awe and don’t think of her as a great personality , as “their priorities are so different.” Comment: A Relaxed [PER Gandhi  ] Provides A [ORG Rare Personal Insight  ] --------------------------------------------- ------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [PER Sonia Gandhi  ] is often stiff and detached when in public . 
This was a more relaxed [PER Sonia  ] , possibly because she felt a personal rapport with [PER Maria Shriver  ] . 
In this more relaxed setting , [PER Sonia Gandhi  ] revealed a left of center political orientation which stresses the strong role of the government in ensuring social progress and her inherent opposition to the social conservatism of the [MISC Hindu  ] right . 
At the same time , she entertained no illusions that she or the [ORG UPA  ] will bring about rapid social change or uplift quickly [MISC India’s  ] oppressed women . 
Instead , she embraced an evolutionary and patient approach based on a broad knowledge of [MISC Indian  ] culture and traditions . 
She was , for example , acutely aware of the vast divide between rural and urban [LOC India  ] and the inherent difficulty of pushing entrenched villagers into the 21st century . 
Deeply hurt by personal tragedy , she has erected a strong and stoic persona to prevent public access to her personal space . 
Whenever she spoke of the deaths of her husband and mother-in-law , she struggled to keep her emotions in check . 
Despite her carefully erected [MISC Indian  ] persona , her basic [MISC Italian  ] personality is clearly evident in her mannerisms , speech and interests . 
She presents an intriguing enigma of a warm private personality that remains concealed and is available only to her closest confidants and family members. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 .
