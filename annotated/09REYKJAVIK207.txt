( [ORG SBU  ] ) Several high-level GOI officials have expressed interest in traveling to the [LOC U.S.  ] in early 2010 to meet with officials at counterpart agencies . 
A visit prior to January is unlikely , as the government lacks the money to finance a trip at the moment and officials are finalizing the 2010 budget . 
However , possible visits by the Minister of Finance , the [ORG Central Bank  ] Governor , and the Minister of [ORG Economic Affairs  ] might take place in January or February. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Central Bank  ] Governor [PER Mar Gudmundsson  ] and Finance Minister [PER Steingrimur Sigfusson  ] told the Charge d'Affaires ( [ORG CDA  ] ) separately that they would like to discuss options for addressing [LOC Iceland  ] 's economic and fiscal challenges with their appropriate counterparts in [LOC Washington  ] as well as the [ORG IMF  ] . 
Minister of [ORG Economic Affairs  ] [PER Gylfi Magnusson  ] told [ORG CDA  ] that he would like to consult with [LOC U.S.  ] experts about how to restructure the banking system going forward and to learn more about where the [LOC U.S.  ] system is today and where it is headed . 
( Note: We expect that [PER Gudmundsson  ] and [PER Sigfusson  ] would travel together , but it is unclear whether [PER Magnusson  ] would go with them or separately .

( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment . 
Post strongly supports the idea of a GOI delegation visiting the [LOC U.S.  ] for consultations . 
This would be an excellent opportunity to build upon strong bilateral relations and to provide public support for [LOC Iceland  ] 's economic recovery . 
Meetings with officials at the [ORG Departments of State and Treasury  ] , and [ORG Federal Reserve  ] as well as with other banking regulators , would be useful . 
In addition , post would recommend a meeting highlighting the positive economic impact of data centers in [LOC Northern Virginia  ] . 
[LOC Iceland  ] is currently looking at this industry as one way to diversify its economy , but at the same time is struggling to create an attractive foreign investment framework that would encourage this diversification . 
End comment .
