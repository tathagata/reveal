End summary . 
[ORG HEU  ] CASKS SECURE , UNCHANGED <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Visiting [ORG DOE  ] experts confirmed December 6 that the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Government  ] had taken the requisite steps to increase security at the [ORG Tajura Nuclear Facility  ] , and that the seven casks of highly enriched uranium ( [ORG HEU  ] ) appeared to have remained unchanged since the planned shipment to [LOC Russia  ] was halted on November 25 ( ref a ) . 
The [ORG DOE  ] experts reported a visible increase in the number of armed guards surrounding the facility . 
They also confirmed that [LOC Tajura  ] staff had disengaged the crane within the facility and had assured the team that a new , unassembled crane would not be built until after the shipment had taken place . 
[ORG DOE  ] 's measurements of the spent fuel within the casks determined that the content had remained unchanged . 
Likewise , the [ORG IAEA  ] seals on each cask remained in place and uncompromised . 
NO DECISIONS <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [ORG DOE  ] team also reported that [MISC Libyan  ] technical specialists at [LOC Tajura  ] had not yet received guidance from the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Government  ] on next steps regarding the shipment . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] The team also reported that although the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Government  ] had sent the [MISC Russian  ] [ORG Government  ] a diplomatic note confirming that the [ORG GOL  ] would complete its contract to return the casks to [LOC Russia  ] by the end of the calendar year , the note did not specify whether the casks would be returned empty or with the [ORG HEU  ] spent fuel shipment . 
The [ORG DOE  ] team assessed the diplomatic note as an attempt to mollify [MISC Russian  ] demands that the casks be returned . 
POSSIBLE NEXT STEPS <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [ORG DOE  ] team estimated that the [ORG GOL  ] must give its approval to move forward on the shipment by December 10 in order for the shipment to take place by the end of December . 
The [ORG DOE  ] experts emphasized that significant lead time is required in order set up the necessary logistical arrangements , permits and overflight clearances for the specialized [MISC Russian  ] plane to return to [LOC Tripoli  ] and transport the [ORG HEU  ] to [LOC Russia.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [ORG DOE  ] team reported that [MISC Russian  ] engineers had begun to design a remote-controlled grapple to be used in the event that the [ORG HEU  ] spent fuel must be off-loaded from the casks in [LOC Libya  ] . 
XXXXXXXXXXXXtold the [ORG DOE  ] experts that , if [ORG GOL  ] approval for the shipment was not forthcoming by December 10 , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] planned to start training on how to use the grapple to off-load the casks . 
( According to [ORG DOE  ] experts , spent nuclear fuel has never been removed from casks for restorage ; the removal of the spent fuel in [LOC Libya  ] would be an unprecedented initiative . 
) [ORG DOE  ] experts also commented that the return of the empty casks to [LOC Russia  ] , if necessary , would be best done by boat and said they are developing contingency plans for that scenario . 
POSITIVE FEEDBACK FROM THE SECRETARY'S CALL <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Separately , emboffs have attempted to seek clarification of the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Government  ] 's next steps regarding the [ORG HEU  ] shipment . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told Pol/Econ Chief that the Secretary 's December 3 call to [MISC Libyan  ] Foreign Minister [PER Musa Kusa  ] had expressed the statement of commitment requested by [PER Saif  ] during [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000950 002 OF 002 his recent meeting with the Ambassador ( ref b ) , and that [PER Kusa  ] had passed the message to the " highest levels " of the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Government  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] emphasized that [PER Saif  ] had made a " commitment " to the Ambassador to ensure that the [ORG HEU  ] shipment would be approved by the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Government  ] , and " [PER Saif  ] will follow-through on that commitment . 
" [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [PER Kusa  ] intended to call the Secretary within the " coming days " in order to personally assure her that the [ORG GOL  ] had approved the shipment . 
Emboffs also briefed [PER Ahmed  ] and [ORG MFA  ] officials on the requisite timeline and lengthy logistical preparations needed to ensure the spent fuel 's transfer to [LOC Russia  ] by the end of the year . 
COMMENT <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] comments indicate that the Secretary 's message to [PER Kusa  ] was positively received . 
A flurry of phone calls between [ORG DOE  ] and [MISC Libyan  ] experts today also indicated that working-level [MISC Libyan  ] officials are seeking more time to resolve the issue , as the [MISC Libyans  ] successfully convinced the [ORG DOE  ] experts to extend the deadline for a [MISC Libyan  ] decision by two days , to December 10 ( the initial deadline proposed by [ORG DOE  ] was December 8 ) . 
At this point , we are interpreting the [MISC Libyan  ] experts' technical preparations for a possible unloading of the casks in [LOC Libya  ] as the contingency planning required to address the very real safety and security concerns raised by the halted shipment . 
We will reassess that view on December 10 , and will continue to underscore with [MISC Libyan  ] officials the need for a resolution of the issue this week .
