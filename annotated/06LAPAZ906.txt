[PER David N. Greenlee  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: President [PER Evo Morales'  ] circle of [MISC Bolivian  ] intellectual advisers occupies half of the President 's Cabinet , including the top three positions: the Vice President , the Minister of the [ORG Presidency  ] , and the Minister of [ORG Sustainable Development  ] and Planning . 
While the intellectuals have more influence over the President than his domestic political advisers , they also compete with [MISC Cuban  ] and [MISC Venezuelan  ] advisers for [MISC Morales'  ] confidence . 
The second tier of intellectual advisers is critical for implementing the government 's policies , including the [MISC Cuban-sponsored  ] education program , negotiating new contracts with international hydrocarbons companies , and carrying out land reform . 
This cable is part two in a three-part series on how [PER Morales  ] has structured his advisory system . 
End summary. -------------------------------------------- First Tier of [ORG Bolivian Intellectual Advisers  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The first tier of President [PER Evo Morales'  ] domestic intellectual advisers is headed by Vice President [PER Alvaro Garcia Linera  ] , followed by Minister of the [ORG Presidency Juan Ramon Quintana  ] and Minister of Planning [PER Carlos Villegas  ] . 
All three were professors at the [ORG Greater University of San Andres  ] ( [ORG UMSA  ] ) before joining the [PER Morales  ] administration . 
[MISC Morales'  ] intellectual advisers have more sway with the President than do his domestic political advisers ( [ORG SEPTEL  ] ) , but they also compete with [MISC Cuban  ] and [MISC Venezuelan  ] consultants for [MISC Morales'  ] confidence . 
They have pursued their own agenda at times , which has angered the President in the past and could push him to rely more on his foreign advisers if these practices continue. -------------------- [PER Alvaro Garcia Linera  ] -------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Vice President [PER Alvaro Garcia Linera  ] is the gatekeeper for [MISC Bolivian  ] advisers and moderates and adds intellectual spin to the President 's vision . 
Nonetheless , [PER Garcia  ] [PER Linera  ] is a committed , even devout ideologue and in the past has criticized [MISC Morales'  ] lack of discipline to leftist ideals ( NFI ) . 
At odds with [PER Morales  ] on several occasions , including disagreeing over Cabinet picks , the Vice President has struggled to find his niche in the [PER Morales  ] administration and may have found it as the [ORG MAS  ] go-to-person for the [ORG Constituent Assembly.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Garcia Linera  ] , ambitious in his own right , was the puivotal political orchestrator of the [ORG Constituent Assembly  ] ( [ORG CA  ] ) process . 
[PER Garcia Linera  ] , who views the [ORG CA  ] as the ultimate forum for reforming the state , is working to build his reputation as the expert on the issue . 
He was a gifted negotiator during the congressional debate over the convoking [ORG CA  ] legislation . 
Embassy contacts say that he was key in talking down radical proposals offered by the [ORG MAS  ] and opposition members , and in forging the final consensus . 
They also note that he had impressive patience and focus during the highly charged negotiations . 
( Comment: Some observers say that [PER Garcia Linera  ] has presisdential aspirations ; if so , recent precedents suggest that the vice presidency is a good place to be . 
It also suggests that he may be competing with [PER Morales  ] for public support . 
End comment . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) A sharp intellectual steeped in largely discredited political , philosophical , and economic theory , [PER Garcia Linera  ] appears to see [LOC Bolivia  ] through the prism of the [MISC French  ] revolution . 
In a recent press interview , he said that he sees himself as the last [MISC Jacobin  ] and [PER Evo  ] as [PER Robbespierre  ] . 
( Comment: The [MISC Jacobins  ] and [PER Robbespierre  ] were notorious for their reign of terror . 
They arrested and executed political [ORG LA PAZ  ] 00000906 002 OF 003 adversaries and allies alike and ultimately met their demise from the same instrument used to execute the opposition: the guillotine . 
To extend the analogy , many pundits have argued that [PER Morales  ] may meet his own demise at the hands of protestors , just as he was a force during protests to oust Presidents [PER Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada  ] and [PER Carlos Mesa  ] . 
End comment . 
) ------------------- [PER Juan Ramon Quintana  ] ------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Embassy contacts have said that Minister of the [ORG Presidency Juan Ramon Quintana  ] is responsible for intelligence and military issues , and for coordinating [MISC Venezuelan  ] and [MISC Cuban  ] support . 
[PER Garcia Linera  ] brought [PER Quintana  ] into his position. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [PER Quintana  ] is a disgruntled former military officer who was fired from his position in the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] in 2000 during the [PER Banzer  ] regime . 
He long suspected that the [LOC US  ] was behind his firing , a suspicion that has some merit , and became stridently anti-U.S. as a result . 
[PER Quintana  ] , upon assuming his current duties , was responsible for the recent removal of 29 flag-rank members of the armed forces , most of whom were cooperating with the [LOC United States  ] . 
The Minister also has been seeking out other officers who have had contact with [LOC U.S.  ] officials , probably with the intent to fire them. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [PER Quintana  ] 's disdain for the [LOC United States  ] is so deep that he withheld from [PER Morales  ] sensitive information passed to him by [LOC U.S.  ] intelligence agencies to prevent the President from knowing that the [MISC Americans  ] were helping him . 
The already suspicious [PER Morales  ] is aware that [PER Quintana  ] withheld information , and sensitive reporting indicates that he is monitoring the Minister . 
[PER Morales  ] may choose to sideline the Minister if the behavior continues . 
Sensitive reporting also indicates that [PER Quintana  ] has had other problems with [PER Morales  ] for paying more attention to getting jobs for his friends than focusing on his substantive duties , something that could further aggravate the relationship. --------------- [PER Carlos Villegas  ] --------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Minister of Planning [PER Carlos Villegas  ] oversees all economic coordination and decisionmaking . 
The Minister of Finance reports to [PER Villegas  ] , and not to [PER Morales  ] . 
[PER Villegas  ] , an economics professor from [ORG UMSA  ] , is steeped in out-dated socialist economic theories and has yet to accept the practical realities of a globalized economy . 
( REF C ) <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) While [PER Villegas  ] may be beginning to understand the real impact of free trade on job creation , he appears to believe that markets in [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC China  ] serve as alternatives to [LOC U.S.  ] markets . 
He has told [MISC Bolivian  ] exporters to seek markets outside the [LOC United States  ] , unconvinced that the [LOC U.S.  ] is crucial to their trade ( REF B ) . 
He recently returned from [LOC Venezuela  ] after negotiating an agreement for [LOC Venezuela  ] to buy [MISC Bolivian  ] soy . 
Additionally , he has regularly antagonized other businesses , telling them that the President 's Dignity Tariff , a new lower price mean to provide cheap electricity to [MISC Bolivians  ] is a done deal , remarking that the private sector should either get on board or suffer . 
( REF A ) . --------------------------------------------- ------------ Second Tier of [MISC Bolivian  ] Intellectuals Implementing Policy --------------------------------------------- ------------ <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The second tier of intellectual advisers includes Minister of [ORG Hydrocarbons Andres  ] [PER Soliz Rada  ] , Minister of Agriculture [PER Hugo Salvatierra  ] , Minister of Education [PER Feliz Patzi  ] , Minister of Finance [PER Luis Arce Catacora  ] , and the palace spokesman [PER Alex Contreras  ] . 
They appear to take instructions from the top tier and from [PER Morales  ] himself . 
At times they [ORG LA PAZ  ] 00000906 003 OF 003 appear more like political " operators " ( [ORG SEPTEL  ] ) doing the President 's bidding . 
In contrast to the political operators , however , the second tier of intellectuals does not tend to engage in strong-arming or undermining the opposition . 
They appear to focus almost exclusively on implementing policy--including coordinating the [MISC Cuban  ] doctors program and pursuing land reform . 
( Comment: [PER Soliz  ] , [PER Salvatierra  ] , and [PER Patzi  ] are all associated with [ORG UMSA  ] . 
) -------------------------------- And then there 's FM [PER Choquehuanca  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) While Foreign Minister [PER David Choquehuanca  ] Cespedes is considered one of [LOC Morales'  ] most prominent intellectuals after [PER Garcia Linera  ] and [PER Villegas  ] , he is more of a figurehead who represents the indigenous face of [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
He appears to be mostly hot air with no real substantive advisory role in traditional foreign policy issues , except for possibly maintaining contacts with [MISC European  ] [ORG NGOs  ] . 
An overly eccentric official , who an Embassy adviser says has a sulfuric relationship with most people , [PER Choquehuanca  ] 's curious statements about his ancestors living for over 200 years and replacing milk with coca in a school nutrition program have drawn criticisms . 
[LOC Morales'  ] largely discredited arch-nemesis [PER Felipe Quispe Huanca  ] has been a vocal supporter of the Minister , which only adds to [PER Choquehuanca  ] 's trivial role . 
Indeed , [PER Choquehuanca  ] appears to have been only marginally involved in [LOC Bolivia  ] 's key foreign policy issues to date .
