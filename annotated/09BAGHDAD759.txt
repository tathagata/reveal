( U ) This is a PRT Salah Ad Din ( [ORG SAD  ] ) reporting cable . 
See action request for [ORG Department and Embassy Baghdad  ] , para 11. <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) SUMMARY: Men purporting to represent the [PER Muhammad Yunis Ahmed  ] ( [ORG MYA  ] ) faction of the [ORG Ba'ath Party  ] ( [ORG BP  ] ) told [ORG Coalition Forces  ] ( [ORG CF  ] ) and the PRT on March 14 that the faction wants to reconcile now , and can bring some of [PER Izzat Ibrahim  ] al-Duri 's [ORG IAD  ] faction along . 
[ORG MYA  ] is ready to meet with a senior [ORG USG  ] official , they said . 
They stressed that they were speaking in confidence: fearing for their own safety , they have not yet contacted the Government of [LOC Iraq  ] ( [ORG GOI  ] ) . 
PRT requests [ORG Department and Embassy  ] assistance in determining their bona fides . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) On March 14 , the PRT and [ORG CF  ] met with four men who identified themselves as senior [ORG Ba'ath Party  ] officials . 
They provided the following unconfirmed information about themselves: - [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] Was three-star general and division commander under [ORG Saddam  ] ; [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] - [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] Member of [ORG SaD Sheikhs' Council  ] , chairman of the [ORG Ad-Dawr Sheikhs' Council  ] . 
Brigadier general in former regime . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] - [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
Senior official in the former [MISC Iraqi  ] Intelligence Services ( commander of the five southern provinces ) . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] - [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
Former brigadier general in the air force [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) The men said they intended this meeting as a formal first step , personally authorized by [PER Mohammed Yunis Ahmed  ] ( [ORG MYA  ] ) , in seeking [ORG USG  ] intervention to help reconcile the [ORG Ba'ath Party  ] ( [ORG BP  ] ) to the [ORG GOI  ] . 
As [ORG MYA  ] 's putative spokesman , [MISC XXXXXXXXXXXXdid  ] most of the speaking . 
This cable relays considerable detail in order to convey the level of discourse . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] passed a message that [ORG MYA  ] is willing to meet personally with a high-level [ORG USG  ] official to discuss reconciliation. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the [ORG BP  ] is organized and planning for the future . 
He explained that it has split into two groups , one following [ORG IAD  ] and the other [ORG MYA  ] . 
[ORG IAD  ] is not willing to negotiate or admit that the [ORG BP  ] ever made mistakes . 
[ORG MYA  ] has been looking back and believes that [ORG Saddam  ] 's regime made many mistakes . 
His faction would like to find a peaceful way to participate in the democratic process . 
They have not yet been in touch with the [ORG GOI  ] because they fear the [ORG GOI  ] is under [MISC Iranian  ] influence and will seek revenge against any [ORG BP  ] members . 
[ORG MYA  ] 's group wants [ORG USG  ] assistance to reconcile because it believes that after the [LOC U.S.  ] leaves [LOC Iraq  ] , it will be much harder to negotiate and if reconciliation is not already well underway by then , there will likely be bloodshed . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that there are about four million [ORG BP  ] members who will need to protect themselves because [MISC Iranians  ] and [MISC Shi'a  ] will persecute them and their families . 
Some of [ORG IAD  ] 's supporters have told [ORG MYA  ] 's group that they also want to reconcile , even without [ORG IAD  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] discussed [ORG BP  ] dissatisfaction with the way [LOC Iraq  ] has been run since the 2003 invasion . 
The [ORG BP  ] was in existence for 62 years and in power for 35 years . 
It was very influential in building [MISC Iraqi  ] society . 
All educated people today were educated under the old regime , which was built by the [ORG BP  ] . 
Although there were problems during its Qbuilt by the [ORG BP  ] . 
Although there were problems during its rule , the last six years have been " ten times worse . 
" Two million [MISC Iraqis  ] have been killed , two million displaced outside the country , and four million displaced internally . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] bears a share of moral and legal responsibility for this . 
President [PER Bush  ] admitted that the invasion was based on false intelligence regarding [ORG WMD  ] . 
Now the [LOC US  ] has allowed [LOC Iran  ] to develop nuclear capabilities , making that country a greater threat than it already was . 
The [ORG GOI  ] is divided and corrupt , built on sectarianism . 
Under the [ORG BP  ] all ethnic groups were included . 
What have the [MISC Iraqis  ] gained for paying such a price ? 
No infrastructure and poor basic services . 
The quality of life in [LOC Iraq  ] has become worse. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) The [ORG BP  ] is not against democracy , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , but fears sectarianism and [MISC Iranian  ] influence . 
It wants to [LOC BAGHDAD  ] 00000759 002 OF 002 participate in political life and is against violence . 
The current democracy is built on sectarianism . 
This has led to strife , kidnappings and assassinations . 
Many now fear that the [LOC U.S.  ] wants to turn [LOC Iraq  ] over to [LOC Iran  ] ; just as [LOC Iran  ] is led by the mullahs , [ORG GOI  ] officials now consult [PER Ayatollah Sistani  ] before making decisions . 
Shiites show how irrational they are in the way they flagellate and beat themselves . 
The [MISC Shi'a  ] are loyal to [LOC Iran  ] ; [LOC Iraq  ] could be returning to medieval times. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) The current [MISC Iraqi  ] Army ( [ORG IA  ] ) is poorly trained , more like a militia than a professional army , said [PER Khalaf  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] has signed a contract to turn over weapon systems to the [ORG IA  ] ; those weapons should be given to trained professionals . 
Many of the weapons will just end up in the hands of [MISC Shiite  ] soldiers who are like militiamen . 
Not all of the [ORG IA  ] are militias , some are professional , but the top leaders lack training . 
The best , most experienced senior officers are outside [LOC Iraq  ] now or are just sitting around at home . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that [ORG MYA  ] has issued an order that [ORG BP  ] members are prohibited from serving in the new [MISC ISF.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) The [ORG MYA  ] faction now believes multi-party democracy is an option , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] continued . 
[ORG IAD  ] does not agree with [ORG MYA  ] , who wants to review [ORG BP  ] activities and leadership from 1968 to the occupation , in order to identify mistakes and put in place a strategy for a changed party . 
[ORG IAD  ] absolutely refuses and believes he should lead the [ORG BP  ] . 
Because of this disagreement the [ORG BP  ] had a conference in December 2007 that elected [ORG MYA  ] as commander . 
The [ORG MYA  ] faction believes the way forward must be peaceful , and refuses to use violence . 
If the [ORG BP  ] is allowed to compete politically , the will of the people will decide . 
The party just wants the same opportunities as others ; it wants to announce that the [ORG BP  ] is back now . 
Even if it is forbidden to have meetings , the [ORG BP  ] is " in our hearts and minds , it represents our values , so you cannot just get rid of it with a quick decision . 
" People believe in the [ORG BP  ] more now , and the [ORG BP  ] includes all ethnic groups . 
The security agencies know that the [ORG BP  ] did not commit crimes , actually it fought against [ORG AQI  ] . 
The [ORG BP  ] had longstanding problems with [ORG AQI  ] before 2003 , and suffered many losses. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) So many [MISC Iraqis  ] have been murdered by groups like [ORG Badr  ] , [PER Mahdi Army  ] , former Interior Minister [PER Solah  ] , [ORG Quds Force  ] , and others . 
The [ORG BP  ] wants peace . 
[LOC Iran  ] stopped the killing when [ORG CF  ] started paying attention to the connection of [MISC Iranians  ] to the violence , but after the [LOC U.S.  ] leaves , it will start again . 
PM Maliki 's words are empty . 
[LOC Iran  ] is getting revenge for the [MISC Iran-Iraq War  ] . 
A month ago , the [ORG GOI  ] banned the use of the word " martyr " for soldiers killed during the war with [LOC Iran  ] . 
Now those dead soldiers are referred to as " victims of the past regime . 
" This takes away their honor for serving their country as soldiers during the war . 
[ORG BP  ] is not so narrow-minded now . 
It wants to have an army that represents everybody . 
The [MISC Iraqi  ] Constitution was written too quickly and is filled with problems . 
[LOC Iraq  ] has the trappings of democracy such as ballot boxes , but sectarianism corrupts the result . 
President [PER Obama  ] said [LOC U.S.  ] forces are leaving , so " we have no more problems with you now " - help us get the ban on the [ORG BP  ] lifted , and pardon the loyal nationalist insurgents. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and his colleagues stressed that they were speaking in confidence to the [ORG USG  ] . 
They explained that they had not approached the [ORG GOI  ] yetbecause they fear they will be arrested even though the [ORG GOI  ] does not have warrants for them . 
Qarrested even though the [ORG GOI  ] does not have warrants for them . 
" Ninety-five percent of us did nothing wrong . 
If there are criminals then try them under the criminal laws , but allow us to bring back the [ORG BP  ] . 
" <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S ) COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST: PRT requests Embassy and Department assistance in verifying the bona fides of [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] Nassir , et al . 
The PRT will work with [ORG CF  ] try to determine whether the delegation truly represents [ORG MYA  ] . 
It is not clear whether there is any connection between this meeting and the PRT [LOC Tikrit Satellite  ] representative 's discussion of similar issues with [ORG Sheikh Hassan Nida of Saddam  ] 's tribe , [PER Albu Nasser  ] ( reftel ) . 
END COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST .
