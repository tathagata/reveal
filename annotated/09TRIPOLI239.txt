REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: On his first visit to [LOC Libya  ] March 10-11 , [ORG U.S. Africa Command  ] 's General [PER William Ward  ] explained the [ORG Command  ] 's mission to [ORG National Security Adviser  ] [PER Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi , reassuring the son of the Leader that the intent was not to establish [LOC U.S.  ] bases on the [MISC African  ] continent , and that his mandate was to work with willing [MISC African  ] governments to improve their ability to provide for their own security . 
[PER Muatassim  ] said there was a growing problem with terrorists in the [LOC Sub-Sahara  ] region and expressed interest in [ORG U.S. Africa Command  ] assistance in the training and equipping of the [MISC North African  ] [ORG Standby Force  ] . 
[PER Muatassim  ] 's main focus , however , was on the bilateral security relationship . 
After relinquishing its [ORG WMD  ] programs , he said , [LOC Libya  ] felt vulnerable and expected the [LOC United States  ] to reciprocate by entering into a more robust bilateral security relationship , including weapons sales and security guarantees . 
General [PER Ward  ] counseled patience and continued engagement with the [ORG Africa Command  ] , through the [LOC Embassy  ] , to build the relationship . 
[PER Muatassim  ] expressed appreciation for the General 's visit and said he hoped the General could meet his father , [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] , on a future occasion ( the Leader was in [LOC Nouakchott  ] during General [PER Ward  ] 's visit to [LOC Tripoli  ] ) .

( [ORG S  ] ) Attendees - Libya: Dr. [PER Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi , Amb . 
[PER Ali Aujali  ] , [ORG MFA Office of Americas  ] Director [PER Mohamed Matari  ] , [ORG NSC  ] Director Dr. [PER Hend Siala  ] , Capt. [PER Saf Saf  ] .

3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Muatassim  ] opened by expressing [MISC Libyan  ] concern about the [ORG Africa Command  ] 's mission , including whether there were plans for [MISC American  ] bases on the continent . 
General [PER Ward  ] explained that the intent was to focus efforts that had previously been covered by three separate commands into one . 
[ORG U.S. Africa Command  ] would be more responsive to [LOC Africa  ] 's needs and seek to increase each country 's ability to provide for its own security , but its formation did not portend a change in [LOC U.S.  ] policy towards [LOC Africa  ] , and there was no intention of introducing bases or large bodies of troops in [LOC Africa  ] . 
He reassured [PER Muatassim  ] that the [ORG Command  ] would be based in [LOC Germany  ] for the foreseeable future . 
In response to [PER Muatassim  ] 's questions about [LOC U.S  ] . 
" bases " in southern [LOC Morocco  ] and the [LOC Gulf  ] of [LOC Guinea  ] , the General explained that there were no [LOC U.S.  ] bases in these countries . 
The [ORG Command  ] had set up a training facility in [LOC Morocco  ] under TSCTP / OEF-TS , and was assisting GoG countries , at their request , under the [LOC Gulf  ] of [LOC Guinea  ] [ORG Africa Partnership Station  ] , with training related to securing their territorial waters . 
4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Muatassim  ] expressed his interest in seeing the [ORG Africa Command  ] assist with the development of the [MISC North African  ] [ORG Standby Force  ] , providing it with training , equipment , and experts . 
" Terrorists are everywhere , " he said , " especially in the [LOC Sub-Sahara  ] , which used to be peaceful . 
" [PER Ward  ] said the [ORG NASF  ] was a good initiative and he would provide assistance if host governments asked for it , and after he had consulted the relevant [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Embassies  ] . 
Throughout the discussion , [PER Ward  ] emphasized that the [ORG Command  ] 's initiatives were undertaken only at the specific request of individual countries and with the concurrence of and close coordination with [LOC U.S.  ] ambassadors . 
5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In response to [PER Muatassim  ] 's question about the relationship between the [ORG Department of Defense  ] and the [ORG Africa Command  ] , [PER Ward  ] explained that the [ORG Command  ] implemented mil-mil activities on behalf of the Secretary of [ORG Defense  ] . 
The General emphasized that the [ORG DATT  ] was in direct contact with his [ORG Command  ] , and the Ambassador suggested that a strong link between [PER Muatassim  ] 's office and the [ORG DATT  ] would help the [ORG USG  ] better interpret [LOC Libya  ] 's needs . 
6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Muatassim  ] asked about the future of the military relationship between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Libya  ] , including prospects for upgrading the mil-mil [ORG MOU  ] to a binding agreement , and for [MISC Libyan  ] purchases of lethal equipment . 
[LOC Libya  ] could pursue a security relationship with the [ORG EU  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , and [LOC China  ] , but preferred a defense strategy based on a special relationship with the [LOC United States  ] , he said . 
[LOC Libya  ] had given up its [ORG WMD  ] , leaving its 5 million populace ( defenseless ) against " tens of millions " in [LOC Algeria  ] and [LOC Egypt  ] , and needed a fulsome security relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] to protect against this vulnerability . 
It was in the [LOC U.S.  ] interest to be responsive , he implied , if the [LOC U.S.  ] wanted to set a positive example for [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC North Korea  ] . 
The General responded that [LOC Libya  ] 's decision to give up [ORG WMD  ] was a good choice and showed foresight . 
[LOC Libya  ] 's joining the community of nations was a deterrent in itself . 
The advancing of the mil-mil relationship with the [LOC United States  ] would underwrite [LOC Libya  ] 's decision . 
7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Muatassim  ] stated that he hoped to have a response soon to the list of [LOC U.S.  ] military equipment the [MISC Libyan  ] delegation [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000239 002.2 OF 002 presented to the [ORG Department of Defense  ] during its visit to [LOC Washington  ] in January . 
The Ambassador explained that such issues take time , but the steps [LOC Libya  ] was taking -- including [PER Muatassim  ] 's planned trip to [LOC Washington  ] in May -- would help . 
[PER Muatassim  ] 's planned trip and the March 12 visit by [MISC Libyan  ] military to the USS [PER Eisenhower  ] would help build confidence and trust between the two sides . 
[PER Muatassim  ] noted that six years had passed since the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Libya  ] had restored ties , and while he was unsure how the new administration would view [LOC Libya  ] , he believed the security relationship needed to develop at a faster pace . 
He said [LOC Libya  ] wanted to participate in the BRIGHT STAR exercise in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
General [PER Ward  ] encouraged [LOC Libya  ] to participate in PHOENIX EXPRESS 09 , and said that such participation , together with other mil-mil engagement , would be positive actions he could cite in his discussions with the [ORG Congress  ] , the [ORG Pentagon  ] , and the [ORG State Department  ] . 
8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Muatassim  ] expressed his thanks and said the relationship should be based on trust and understanding . 
[PER Ward  ] said they would work through the details and build trust . 
[PER Ward  ] said his [ORG HQ  ] was just a place for planning , and that his officers needed to travel to help build partner capacity , including mil-mil activities such as civic action , veterinary , and engineering support available . 
The Ambassador added that [LOC Libya  ] was invited to join TSCTP . 
[PER Muatassim  ] said he regretted that General [PER Ward  ] would not have the opportunity to meet with his father on this visit , as the Leader was dealing with the crisis in [LOC Mauritania  ] as well as the assassination in [LOC Guinea  ] . 
[PER Muatassim  ] inquired if it would be possible for [PER Ward  ] to meet the Leader somewhere else on the continent . 
[PER Ward  ] demurred , saying he could not go without an invitation from the other country . 
[PER Muatassim  ] responded that as the Leader was President of the [ORG AU  ] , he could invite [PER Ward  ] to visit any country in [LOC Africa  ] . 
9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Comment: While General [PER Ward  ] 's discussion went a long way toward alleviating some of the strong concerns the [MISC Libyans  ] had expressed about [ORG U.S. Africa Command  ] , the [ORG GOL  ] continues to espouse a rejectionist public line -- " [MISC Africans  ] reject [MISC AFRICOM  ] " -- characterizing the [ORG Command  ] as a vehicle for the [LOC United States  ] to promote neo-colonial policies on the continent . 
Despite the negative rhetoric , Leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] , who reportedly personally approved General [PER Ward  ] 's visit and delegated his son [PER Muatassim  ] to meet with him in his stead , views a strong military relationship with the [LOC United States  ] as an essential element of his security strategy . 
At the end of the meeting , [PER Muatassim  ] took the Ambassador aside to strongly urge the General to take up the Leader 's offer to visit him in [LOC Mauritania  ] . 
To the Ambassador 's reply that the General could not do that , [PER Muatassim  ] said , " The General must come back ; I will guarantee a meeting with the Leader when he does . 
" As [PER Muatassim  ] 's comments demonstrate , [LOC Libya  ] is impatient to broaden the relationship , particularly through lethal equipment purchases and " security guarantees , " which they appear to be making the litmus test for the future of the relationship . 
The challenge will be to reduce the [MISC Libyan  ] sense of impatience over what they believe has been [LOC U.S.  ] foot-dragging since 2003 , their starting date for the new relationship . 
We have said in follow-up discussions that the relationship in effect began on November 1 , 2008 , the day the [ORG GOL  ] made the final payments due to the claims settlement fund . 
End comment .
