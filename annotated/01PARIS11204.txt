( C ) WE DELIVERED REFTEL POINTS TO FOREIGN MINISTER VEDRINE'S OFFICE AND TO MFA AFGHAN DESK OFFICER BRUCE BOURDON ON OCTOBER 11 AND FOLLOWED-UP WITH A MEETING WITH BOURDON ON OCTOBER 12 . 
BOURDON TOLD US THAT THE FRENCH WERE ENGAGED IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THEIR EU PARTNERS REGARDING AFGHANISTAN'S POLITICAL FUTURE . 
HE NOTED THESE DISCUSSIONS HAD BEEN STIMULATED IN PART BY FOREIGN MINISTER HUBERT VEDRINE'S ACTION PLAN FOR [LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] . 
[PER HOWEVER  ] , HE ADDED THAT THE FRENCH HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED ANY SPECIFIC COMMENTS , DOCUMENTS , OR PROPOSALS ABOUT WHERE TO GO NEXT IN [LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] FROM THEIR EU PARTNERS . 
BOURDON SAID THIS LACK OF RESPONSE WAS PROBABLY DUE TO SEVERAL FACTORS: INSUFFICIENT TIME TO RESPOND , UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE DIRECTION THE WAR IN [LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] WOULD TAKE , AND , THE CURRENT HEAVY TRAVEL SCHEDULE OF SENIOR MFA OFFICIALS . 
BOURDON NOTED VEDRINE WAS VISITING [LOC ROME  ] WHERE HE WILL BE MEETING WITH FORMER KING MOHAMMED ZAHIR SHAH , WHILE THE MFA'S DIRECTOR FOR ASIA , [PER DOMINIQUE GIRARD  ] , IS VISITING [LOC WASHINGTON  ] . 
TONGUE IN CHEEK , BOURDON COMMENTED THAT GIVEN GIRARD'S VISIT TO [LOC WASHINGTON  ] , IT WAS LIKELY THE [LOC U.S.  ] GOVERNMENT WOULD KNOW MORE ABOUT FRANCE'S POSITION ON [LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] THAN HE WOULD . 
BOURDON , [PER HOWEVER  ] , MADE CLEAR THAT IN TRYING TO DEVELOP A POSITION ON AFGHANISTAN'S POLITICAL FUTURE , [LOC FRANCE  ] WAS PAYING PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO [MISC THE OPINIONS OF  ] [MISC THE GERMANS  ] , [MISC BRITISH  ] , AND [MISC ITALIANS  ] . 
[MISC THE FRENCH  ] WILL LISTEN POLITELY TO OTHER EU MEMBERS , BUT IT IS THOSE THREE COUNTRIES WHO ARE MOST INVOLVED IN [MISC THE CRISIS  ] AND CONTRIBUTING THE MOST FINANCIALLY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) BOURDON SAID HE DID NOT EXPECT ANYONE TO BE ABLE TO DEVELOP A COHERENT POSITION UNTIL THE COURSE OF THE WAR IN [LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] BECAME A BIT CLEARER . 
HE EXPLAINED THAT [MISC THE FRENCH  ] WERE WATCHING DEVELOPMENTS CLOSELY TO SEE WHETHER [MISC THE TALIBAN  ] COLLAPSED OR IF THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO HANG ON TO POWER FOR SOME TIME . 
WHILE THE FRENCH HOPE FOR A QUICK COLLAPSE AND A RAPID CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES , THERE IS SOME CONCERN THAT IN A WORST CASE , [ORG THE CONFLICT COULD DRAG  ] ON THROUGH THE END OF THIS YEAR AND WELL INTO 2002 . 
BOURDON NOTED THE FRENCH WERE ALSO KEEPING AN EYE ON PAKISTANI BEHAVIOR TOWARDS [LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] AND [MISC THE TALIBAN  ] . 
HE EXPLAINED THAT THE FRENCH WERE UNCERTAIN WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT OF [LOC PAKISTAN  ] WOULD ALLOW [MISC THE TALIBAN  ] TO CRUMBLE , OR WHETHER THE GOP , OR A ROGUE ELEMENT OF THE GOP , WOULD FIND SOME MEANS TO PROVIDE COVERT SUPPORT TO [MISC THE TALIBAN  ] . 
UNSURE ABOUT WHAT COMES NEXT , [MISC THE FRENCH  ] NEVERTHELESS BELIEVE THE GOP NEEDS TO BE INVOLVED IN DECISIONS RELATING TO AFGHANISTAN'S FUTURE AND THAT IT IS CRUCIAL TO FIND AFGHAN PASHTUNS WHO CAN PLAY A PROMINENT ROLE. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) BOURDON SAID THE FRENCH BELIEVED FORMER KING MOHAMMED ZAHIR SHAH WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO PLAY A VERY LIMITED ROLE . 
HE MAY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE IMPETUS TO START A DIALOGUE , [PER LOYA JIRGA  ] , BUT HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO THINGS HIMSELF . 
[MISC THE FRENCH  ] ALSO BELIEVE WE , WESTERN COUNTRIES , SHOULD BE CAREFUL TO NOT TRY TO IMPOSE ANY DECISIONS FROM THE OUTSIDE . 
THERE MIGHT BE A SMALL SUPERVISORY ROLE FOR THE UNITED NATIONS , BUT THERE SHOULD NOT BE ANY EFFORT TO DEPLOY A LARGER-SCALE [ORG UN  ] MISSION A [LOC LA  ] KOSOVO OR [LOC EAST TIMOR  ] . 
A LARGE [ORG UN  ] MISSION SIMPLY WOULD NOT WORK AND IT WOULD QUICKLY BECOME IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVIDE ANY KIND OF SECURITY FOR A LARGE [ORG UN  ] MISSION . 
THE FRENCH SEE THE UN'S ROLE AS MINIMAL , SIMPLY BEING A PRESENCE TO URGE FOLLOW-UP TO DECISIONS MADE BY AFGHANS. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) WHEN ASKED ABOUT VEDRINE'S OCTOBER 10 MEETING WITH LAKHDAR BRAHIMI , BOURDON ( PLEASE PROTECT ) REPLIED THAT VEDRINE WAS UP TO HIS USUAL TRICKS . 
HE EXPLAINED THE VEDRINE-BRAHIMI MEETING HAD BEEN A TETE-A-TETE AND VEDRINE DID NOT BOTHER TO BRIEF ANYONE IN THE MFA ABOUT THEIR CONVERSATION . 
BOURDON SAID THE ONLY THING HE KNEW CAME FROM ONE OF VEDRINE'S PROTOCOL OFFICERS WHO ESCORTED BRAHIMI TO THE MEETING . 
THE PROTOCOL OFFICER SAID BRAHIMI EXPRESSED THE VIEW THAT [LOC PAKISTAN  ] WOULD NEED TO PLAY A ROLE IN REACHING AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE NORTHERN ALLIANCE AND ZAHIR SHAH'S SUPPORTERS . 
BRAHIMI ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT SECURITY FOR THE PERSONNEL OF [ORG UN  ] AGENCIES AND NGOS AFTER THE [LOC U.S.  ] DOES ITS JOB . 
BRAHIMI SAID HE SAW NO WAY TO PREVENT INSTABILITY AND HAD NO SUGGESTIONS REGARDING HOW TO CHANGE THIS . 
A MEMBER OF FM VEDRINE'S STAFF ADDED THAT BRAHIMI TOLD VEDRINE THAT HE WAS APPROCHING HIS NEW RESPONSIBILITIES WITH NO PRECONCEPTIONS .
