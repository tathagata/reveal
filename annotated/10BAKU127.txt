2 - THE MINISTER OF EMERGENCY SITUATIONS , BELUGA CAVIAR , AND FRUIT JUICE ( C-RE9-02494 ; C-RE9-02493 ; C-RE9-02492 ) REF: [LOC BAKU  ] 54 Classified By: XXXXXXXXXXXX a.i. , for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) SUMMARY: This cable is the second in a series that profiles the most powerful families in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] , both in terms of economic and political power . 
This issue features Minister of [ORG Emergency Situations  ] [PER Kamaladdin Heydarov  ] and his family . 
[PER Heydarov  ] was previously Chairman of the [ORG State Customs Committee  ] , and his hand-picked successor now operates that agency , one of the most corrupt operations in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] . 
The [PER Heydarov  ] family , which controls a business empire in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] ranging from fruit juice production to real estate development , is the second most powerful commercial family in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] , after the Pashayev family ( into which President [PER Aliyev  ] married ) . 
End Summary . 
The [MISC Man Behind the Power  ] ------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Kamaladdin Heydarov  ] is the most powerful member of this family , and some observers have said he might be even more powerful than the President himself . 
( [ORG COMMENT: Post  ] does not believe this is true , although [PER Heydarov  ] controls more visible assets and wealth within the country than the President . 
End Comment . 
) His father , [PER Fattah Heydarov  ] , is a Member of Parliament from the mountainous [LOC Qabala  ] district , which serves as a home base for the family outside [LOC Baku  ] . 
[PER Fattah  ] was Secretary of the [MISC Ordubad  ] ( and later [LOC Julfa  ] ) [ORG District Party Committee  ] during [MISC Soviet  ] times , and served as Minister of the [ORG Welfare Service of Nakhchivan  ] from 1976 to 1978 and later as Nakhchivan’s Minister of Culture from 1983 to 1995. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Kamaladdin Heydarov  ] was Chairman of the [ORG State Customs Committee  ] for nine years , and since 2006 has been head of the para-military [ORG Ministry of Emergency Situations  ] ( [ORG MES  ] ) , which acts as a super-Federal [ORG Emergency Management Agency  ] , [PER Fire Marshall  ] , health and safety inspector , and overall regulator of many aspects of the economy . 
Born in 1961 , he holds a degree in [LOC Geology  ] and [LOC International Law  ] from the [ORG Azerbaijan State University  ] . 
He held executive positions in a number of private and public enterprises prior to his appointment at the ripe old age of 35 as Chairman of the [ORG State Customs Committee  ] ( [ORG SCC  ] ) , an agency that is notoriously corrupt , even by [MISC Azerbaijani  ] standards . 
Heydarov’s rise to power was partly a result of the strong relationship between his father [PER Fattah  ] and former President [PER Heydar Aliyev  ] ( also from [ORG Nakhchivan  ] ) , but also partly a result of Heydarov’s strong management skills . 
As he gained wealth for the ruling party , [PER Heydar Aliyev’s  ] respect for him grew , until finally he was entrusted with the valuable role of Chairman of the [LOC SCC.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG State Customs  ] position allowed him to gain his massive wealth , as significant illicit payments were paid “up the food chain” in an elaborate and well-orchestrated system of payoff and patronage . 
[PER Heydarov  ] likely still enjoys a sizeable income from the [ORG SCC  ] , as it is controlled by his loyal successor . 
When President [PER Ilham Aliyev  ] appointed [PER Heydarov  ] as Minister of [ORG Emergency Situations  ] in 2006 , he was replaced at the [ORG SCC  ] by his Deputy [PER Aydin Aliyev  ] . 
[PER Aydin Aliyev  ] is not related to President [PER Aliyev  ] , and [PER Heydarov  ] is [PER Aydin Aliyev’s  ] sole benefactor , a symbiotic relationship in which [PER Aliyev  ] presumably gives undying loyalty ( and a hefty cut ) to the powerful [PER Heydarov  ] in order to retain his position . 
When Charge first met [PER Heydarov  ] in 2007 , the Minister had been in office for less than a year but had a chest full of military ribbons that would rival the [LOC U.S.  ] Chairman of the [ORG Joint Chiefs  ] . 
Presumably he transferred them directly from his old [ORG State Customs  ] uniform . 
The [ORG Ministry of Everything Significant  ] ( [ORG MES  ] ) -------------------------------------------- [LOC BAKU  ] 00000127 002 OF 004 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Ministry of Emergency Situations  ] ( [ORG MES  ] ) has consistently proven itself to be one of the most powerful ministries in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] . 
It is suspected to have the largest revenue of any [ORG Ministry  ] . 
It even has its own para-military unit , consistent with other such ministries in the [ORG CIS  ] . 
[PER Heydarov  ] mentioned to a visiting [LOC Washington  ] VIP in 2008 that his ministry had recently taken control of an anti-aircraft battery near [LOC Baku  ] in which he had served as a young conscript during [MISC Soviet  ] times . 
The [ORG Ministry  ] now controls the fire departments and other emergency services , fire code inspections , state grain reserves , and construction licensing . 
This last area of responsibility ( perhaps the most important for foreign entities operating in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] ) also covers building inspectors who can interfere with , delay , or stop any construction project they declare to be “unsafe.” In fact , [ORG MES  ] staff have previously warned [MISC American  ] and other foreign businessmen that their purview covers anything that is associated with temperature , pressure , or isotopes -- categories broadly interpreted to include just about everything under the sun. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) It is often said mockingly that in Azerbaijan’s judicial system , one can only win a case if one is friends with the judge - or if introduced by [PER Benjamin Franklin  ] ( read: significant cash ) . 
Of course being known to the judge as politically powerful is another path to courtroom victory . 
The path to certifying a building’s safety is likely similar , and the true structural integrity of [LOC Baku’s  ] recent construction boom is suspect . 
In 2007 , a multi-story high-rise under construction crashed to the ground , killing several workers . 
In January 2010 , three workers were killed when they fell from a building under construction on high-rent [ORG Neftchiler Prospect  ] ( reftel ) . 
Suspect construction is widespread in [LOC Baku  ] , as new , speculative real estate ventures in central [LOC Baku  ] ( including high-rise buildings ) are largely vacant , while practical buyers bid up the prices of flats in “Stalin-ka” buildings that pre-date independence . 
These older buildings , which tend to be low-rise , are thought to have had higher construction standards and generally be safer and more dependable. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) These types of market developments do not bode well for the reputation of [ORG MES  ] , which is widely viewed as a cash cow for [LOC Baku’s  ] elite , and the [PER Heydarov  ] family in particular . 
If an event such as an earthquake led to widespread destruction of property , it is assumed that outrage would be private , rather than public , and would not boil over into attacks on contractors or corrupt bureaucrats , as was the case after the 1999 earthquake in [LOC Istanbul  ] . 
Some less powerful contractors would become easy targets , but the true architects of disaster such as Heydarov’s [ORG MES  ] would find a way to use its resources and the tools of the state to escape any reprisal . 
His Boys and Their Toys ----------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Kamaladdin’s two sons , [PER Nijat Heydarov  ] and [PER Tale Heydarov  ] , have recently expressed a desire to purchase two [ORG Gulfstream  ] jets , valued at $20 million each . 
The family also owns an [MISC Airbus A319  ] corporate jet that is presently undergoing cabin completion in [LOC Basel  ] , [LOC Switzerland  ] . 
According to initial reports , ownership of the [MISC Gulfstreams  ] would be shared between “Shams al [PER Sahra FZCO”  ] ( registered in [LOC Dubai  ] to [PER Tale  ] and [PER Nijat  ] ) and Mr. [PER Manouchehr Ahadpur Khangah  ] , with [ORG Shams al  ] [PER Sahra  ] and Kangah each holding 50 percent of each jet . 
[PER Khangah  ] was not previously known to the [MISC Embassy  ] , but according to information from [ORG Gulfstream  ] appears to be a citizen of both [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Azerbaijan  ] ( unclear if he also holds other passports ) . 
Purportedly as part of [ORG Patriot Act  ] compliance , [ORG Gulfstream  ] asked the [ORG Heydarovs  ] for information that would confirm the lawful sources of their wealth . 
The [LOC BAKU  ] 00000127 003 OF 004 [ORG Heydarovs  ] provided [ORG Gulfstream  ] an overview of their family holdings , and it appears they own more businesses than any other [MISC Azerbaijani  ] family , including companies in food canning , construction materials , concrete , asphalt , chemicals , bricks , textiles , CD and DVD production ( since licensed CDs or DVDs are generally unavailable on the local market , these are certainly all pirated ) , milk processing , tourism , gypsum materials , leather , agriculture , pianos , alcohol and spirits , juices , banking , insurance , and construction. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) One [MISC Embassy  ] contact , XXXXXXXXXXXX referred to [PER Khangah  ] as the Chief Executive Officer or “front man” of a substantial portion of the [PER Heydarov  ] family conglomerate . 
This contact noted that while [PER Khangah  ] is listed as the official owner of various businesses , they are very much [MISC Heydarov-owned  ] operations in which [PER Khangah  ] functions more as a manager . 
This source added that Khangah’s role was mirrored by an unnamed [MISC Turkish  ] citizen who controls another segment of the family businesses. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Many of the family , s operations are part of the “Gilan , ” “Qabala , ” “Jala , ” or “United Enterprises International ( [ORG UEI  ] ) ” family of companies . 
[ORG Gilan Holdings  ] is omnipresent in [LOC Baku  ] , as the company is one of several major real estate developers and has been in the forefront of [LOC Baku’s  ] highly speculative real estate market . 
Observers compare [ORG Gilan  ] to [ORG Dubai World  ] or [ORG Nakheel  ] , although admittedly on a smaller scale . 
The [ORG Heydarovs  ] have largely cornered the fruit juice market in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] , maintaining extremely high prices for locally produced juices and watered-down juice drinks , while making life difficult -- with the help of [ORG State Customs  ] -- for cheaper competitors from [LOC Turkey  ] , [LOC Ukraine  ] and [LOC Russia  ] . 
When USAID tried to support the production and distribution of pomegranate products in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] , they quickly learned that no one sells pomegranate juice , concentrate , or derivatives from [LOC Azerbaijan  ] without Heydarov’s permission . 
Azerbaijan’s economy is largely dominated by monopolistic interests , and observers suggest that the [ORG Heydarovs  ] are at the top of this mountain of non-competition . 
It is rumored that the [ORG Heydarovs  ] also have interests in the local [MISC Pepsi  ] bottler , the local license for [ORG Red Bull  ] , [ORG British American Tobacco  ] , [ORG Japan Tobacco  ] , and [ORG Imperial Tobacco  ] . 
[PER Heydarov  ] has readily admitted to visiting [LOC U.S.  ] delegations that he owns and operates the [ORG Caspian Fish Company  ] which controls the lucrative ( and previously [MISC Russian  ] Mafia-controlled ) [MISC Beluga Caviar  ] production in [LOC Azerbaijan.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG Heydarovs  ] are also active in cultural endeavors . 
[PER Kamaladdin Heydarov  ] is a composer and has written a song about former President [PER Heydar Aliyev  ] that was sung by [MISC Azeri  ] singer [PER Aghadadash Aghayev  ] . 
His wife is ethnic [MISC Korean  ] , and he himself is quite the Koreaphile ; he is President of the [ORG Azerbaijan Taekwondo Federation  ] and owner of the recently opened high-end [MISC Korean  ] restaurant “Shilla.” [MISC Korean  ] diplomats have confirmed that [PER Heydarov  ] was the protector for several major business deals , but have complained that many of these deals have gone awry after the [MISC Korean  ] firms refused to pay adequate patronage to [PER Heydarov.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Heydarov’s son [PER Tale  ] is the President of The [ORG European Azerbaijan Society  ] ( [ORG TEAS  ] ) , and has made rounds to [LOC U.S.  ] embassies in [MISC European  ] capitals from his [LOC London  ] base . 
The “society” purports to be an independent advocacy group , but its talking points very much reflect the goals and objectives of the [ORG GOAJ  ] . 
In recent meetings , [PER Tale  ] and his cohorts have raised “Armenian aggression” in [LOC Nagorno-Karabakh  ] and “double standards” of [LOC U.S.  ] human rights and democracy reporting in the region , and complained about efforts of the [ORG U.S. Congress  ] to provide humanitarian assistance within the [LOC Nagorno-Karabakh  ] enclave . 
[PER Tale  ] and/or [PER Nijat  ] also own the [ORG Qabala Football Club  ] -- perhaps as a small-scale effort to replicate the [ORG Chelsea  ] antics of Russia’s [PER Roman Abramovich  ] . 
The [LOC Qabala  ] squad is a virtual [ORG United Nations  ] team , with [LOC BAKU  ] 00000127 004 OF 004 players from across [LOC Europe  ] , [LOC Latin America  ] and [LOC Africa  ] -- the best team money can buy , at least for central [LOC Azerbaijan  ] . 
Both sons were educated in [LOC London  ] and presently live there . 
[PER Tale  ] holds a B.A. in International Relations and History from the [ORG London School of Economics  ] and an [MISC M.A.  ] in Security and [ORG Global Governance  ] from [ORG Birkbeck College  ] , while [PER Nijat  ] holds a B.A. in [LOC Politics  ] and [LOC East European Studies  ] from [ORG University College London  ] and an [MISC M.A.  ] in Management , [ORG Organizations  ] , and [ORG Governance  ] from the [ORG London School of Economics  ] . 
Some newspapers have reported that [PER Tale  ] might return to [LOC Baku  ] to become a Member of Parliament later this year . 
It’s Good to Be King -------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) The family’s influence is strongest in the regions of [LOC Qabala  ] , [LOC Masalli  ] , and [MISC Lenkeran  ] . 
Postsuspects that [PER Heydarov  ] continues to control the tate [ORG Customs Committee  ] and wield influence over the [ORG Ministry of Taxes  ] , the [ORG Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources  ] , and [ORG Ministry of Economic Development  ] , which is now led by a former [ORG Ministry of Taxes  ] official . 
Additionally , of course , [PER Heydarov  ] profits significantly from widespread activities of the [ORG Ministry of Emergency Situations  ] . 
That ministry , according to observers , may be the most sought after employer in official [LOC Baku  ] , as [PER Heydarov  ] has made a reputation for paying salaries on time and in full . 
Employees benefit from perks of MES employment , such as the ability to enroll children in one of Baku’s best-looking and best-financed public schools . 
Measures like these , contacts report , create a loyal following for the minister among his minions . 
Turf Wars: Don’t Cross [PER Kamaladdin  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Embassy contacts note that [PER Kamaladdin Heydarov  ] is currently in a “fight over grain” with Minister of Agriculture [PER Ismat Abbasov  ] , and wants [PER Abbasov  ] replaced by Member of Parliament [PER Eldar Ibrahimov  ] . 
Historically , those who have fought with [PER Heydarov  ] have always fared poorly: [PER Farhad Aliyev  ] and [PER Heydar Babayev  ] were ( in succession ) driven out as Minister of [ORG Economic Development  ] in part after falling on [MISC Heydarov’s  ] bad side . 
Both were billed as reformers , and the economic reforms they were seen to propose stood to hurt [MISC Heydarov’s  ] interests at the [ORG State Customs Committee  ] and the [ORG Ministry of Emergency Situations  ] . 
In addition , some opposition newspapers had begun to call them potential candidates for the position of Prime Minister . 
Feeling threatened by their reform activity and growing power , [PER Heydarov  ] allegedly put his foot down . 
Both were removed from government and their business interests were seriously damaged . 
Rumors circulated in 2009 that [PER Heydarov  ] may have even been behind the assassination of [ORG Air Force Chief  ] and Deputy Defense Minister General [PER Rail Rzayev  ] . 
The rumors point to the widely-reported forced landing of [MISC Heydarov’s  ] helicopter after it took off without obtaining flight clearance. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( U ) The next issue of “Who Owns What” will profile the family of [PER Ziya Mammadov  ] , the Minister of Transportation . 
With so much of the nation’s oil wealth being poured into road construction , the [MISC Mammadovs  ] also control a significant source of rent-seeking . 
His holdings extend to the buses that run throughout [LOC Baku  ] . 
A recent television report asked if the [MISC Mammadovs  ] controlled mysterious construction company [ORG ZQAN Holding  ] ; the reporter pointed out the letters of [ORG ZQAN  ] matched the initials of father [PER Ziya  ] , mother [PER Qanira  ] , son [PER Anar  ] , and daughter [PER Nigar  ] . 
A [ORG ZQAN  ] representative brushed this aside as innuendo .
