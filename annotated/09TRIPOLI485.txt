( C ) Summary: Under the [ORG Department of Commerce 's Commercial Law Development Program  ] ( [ORG CLDP  ] ) , a [LOC U.S.  ] federal judge conducted a workshop for 30 [MISC Libyan  ] judges and attorneys on international arbitration from June 3-4 in at the [ORG High Judicial Institute  ] in [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
The program represents the first step in a program to expose [MISC Libyan  ] judges to international arbitration best practices . 
Our [MISC Libyan  ] interlocutors warmly welcomed the judge on her first trip to [LOC Libya  ] , asked her to return to [LOC Libya  ] for future programs and told [ORG Emboffs  ] that the [ORG High Judicial Institute  ] could directly coordinate future training sessions without working through the [ORG MFA  ] or MinJustice equivalents . 
Holding the workshop at the judicial institute provided a window into [LOC Libya  ] 's otherwise largely opaque judicial system , and could in the future afford a channel in which to address more sensitive topics such as human rights and judicial reform . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Under the auspices of the [ORG CLDP  ] , Judge [PER Delissa Ridgway  ] ( [ORG U.S. Court of International Trade  ] ) traveled to [LOC Libya  ] May 30-June 4 to conduct a two-day workshop for [MISC Libyan  ] judges and state attorneys on international arbitration . 
Funded by the [LOC Middle East Partnership Initiative  ] ( [ORG MEPI  ] ) , the workshop represents the first step in a program to expose [MISC Libyan  ] judges to international arbitration best practices , a topic the [MISC Libyan  ] General People 's Committee for [ORG Justice  ] ( [ORG MOJ-equivalent  ] ) had indicated was a priority . 
Proposed future activities include connecting the judges to their counterparts in [LOC Tunisia  ] , where there is an arbitration center , and to judges and courts in the [LOC U.S.  ] Strengthening the [MISC Libyan  ] judges' expertise in this area is expected to contribute to the long-term improvement of the commercial legal environment , creating better conditions for [LOC U.S.  ] companies operating in [LOC Libya.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Before the arbitration workshop , the Embassy 's main point of contact for commercial law programming was the [ORG International Cooperation Department  ] at the [ORG GPC  ] for [ORG Justice  ] . 
In three preparatory trips to [LOC Libya  ] ( between November 2008 and February 2009 ) , [ORG Commercial Law Development Program  ] staff were unable to meet with the [MISC Libyan  ] body responsible for actually training judges , the [ORG High Judicial Institute  ] ; however , once Judge [PER Ridgway  ] arrived , a meeting was hastily arranged by the [ORG GPC  ] for [ORG Justice  ] with the Chief Inspector of Judges , [PER Juma Bouzaid  ] , and the Director of the [ORG High Judicial Institute  ] , Dr. [PER Nouredeen Alakrmi  ] . 
[PER Bouzaid  ] , who speaks fluent [MISC English  ] , was curious about the [LOC U.S.  ] judicial system and asked a series of cogent questions about immunity for judges , how [LOC U.S.  ] judges are evaluated and how the [ORG Supreme Court  ] decides which cases to hear . 
He noted that in [LOC Libya  ] , judges ( and state attorneys ) have full immunity and that the [ORG Supreme Court  ] would ( theoretically ) hear any case that had been appealed in a lower court . 
The Director of the [ORG High Judicial Institute  ] , [PER Alakrmi  ] , admitted he had no prior knowledge of the [ORG CLDP  ] workshop ( reflecting the lack of coordination on the GOL side ) , but said he would quickly arrange for the workshop to take place over the next two days . 
He added that in [LOC Libya  ] , there is a great interest in learning more about the " [MISC Anglo-Saxon  ] " and [LOC U.S.  ] judicial approaches . 
( Note: 75 [MISC Libyan  ] judges are currently undergoing training in the [LOC U.K.  ] under a GOL-funded program to teach them [MISC English  ] for nine months , and to then provide training in international law . 
End note .

( C ) On June 3 , approximately 30 judges and state-attorneys showed up for the first day of the workshop . 
The original proposal from [ORG CLDP  ] called for a smaller group of judges ( around 20 ) from all over [LOC Libya  ] , with a gender balance . 
The Embassy also asked for a list of participants prior to the workshop in order to tailor the sessions to their backgrounds and level of experience ; however , no list was provided in advance . 
The group was also intended to include only judges ; however , the institute staff explained that in [LOC Libya  ] state attorneys could be rotated into positions as judges on an annual basis , so it would be beneficial to include them in the workshop as well . 
Approximately half the group were women and half men ; most of the judges were men . 
At the coffee break , one of the female attorneys admitted to Econoff that she did not want to become a judge because it would take up too much time , and she needed a more regular schedule in order to take care of her family . 
Very few of the participants spoke [MISC English  ] - the justice ministry provided an [MISC English-speaking  ] employee to interpret , but since he was not a trained interpreter the quality was spotty . 
( Note: In the future , it may be useful to consider funding a professional interpreter for similar USG-funded workshops . 
End note ) . <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The workshop comprised an overview of the [LOC U.S.  ] judicial [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000485 002.2 OF 002 system and a presentation on international commercial arbitration , with an emphasis on the concept that in international commerce , the two parties are free to enter into a contract as equals and the court 's role is to enforce the contract . 
The importance of predictability was stressed as a key to attracting foreign investment ; the role judges and lawyers play in ensuring fair application of the law is therefore important in creating the perception of a favorable business environment . 
Questions from the [MISC Libyan  ] participants included how [LOC U.S.  ] courts would deal with General [ORG Motors'  ] bankruptcy and when " public order " in a sovereign nation takes precedence over a contract . 
[PER Alakrmi  ] , the director of the judicial institute , commented that " judges must be brave " and give greater consideration to international public policy than to domestic politics . 
Concepts such as the sanctity of contracts and the choice of law and forum were discussed . 
Even though [LOC Libya  ] is not yet a party to the [ORG New York Convention  ] on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitration awards , [MISC Libyan  ] judges said most of them were familiar with the convention since five [MISC Arab  ] countries are already parties to it . 
The presentation was followed by practical exercises involving real cases in order for the participants to actively discuss how they would handle various cases - Judge [PER Ridgway  ] said she was impressed by their level of participation and enthusiasm. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) During the week in [LOC Tripoli  ] , the [ORG CLDP  ] visitors were also able to meet with members of the construction and energy sectors . 
[ORG Shell  ] 's [ORG Country Manager  ] admitted that his company would " move heaven and earth to avoid litigation , " particularly in [LOC Libya  ] . 
They viewed their relationship as being with " [LOC Libya  ] , Inc . 
" and assess that going to arbitration could seriously that relationship and their long-term investments . 
Noting that [ORG Shell  ] had gone through an arbitration case in [LOC Qatar  ] , he said it had taken many years for the company to get back on track there . 
He noted that while [ORG Shell  ] 's contracts with the [ORG National Oil Company  ] are written under [MISC Libyan  ] law , its contracts with international oil service contractors are usually under [LOC U.K.  ] law. xxxxxxxxxxxx In [LOC Libya  ] , it was still the case that relationships and negotiations take precedence over the legal system. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) By holding the workshop at the judicial institute , [ORG CLDP  ] and the Embassy gained a better understanding of the legal education system in [LOC Libya  ] . 
Only about 110 students ( out of 500 applicants ) a year are admitted to the institute . 
Successful completion of the institute 's curriculum is a requirement to become a state attorney , which is the stepping-stone to a judgeship . 
Before candidates are admitted to the institute , they must study law for four years after graduating from high school and then pass written and oral exams . 
The other alternative is to enter a private law practice and work as a trainee for two years before becoming a lawyer . 
The salary for a government lawyer ranges between 500 and 1,000 dinars a month ( equivalent to [ORG USD  ] 400-800 a month ) , whereas a private attorney can earn approximately 3,000 dinars a month ( [ORG USD  ] 2,400 ) or more. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG Comment:  ] The [ORG CLDP  ] workshop on arbitration was a good first step in forging a working relationship with the judicial education system in [MISC Libyan  ] . 
It also provided access to the otherwise-opaque system of justice here . 
The judicial institute 's director welcomed Judge [PER Ridgway  ] to come back to [LOC Libya  ] and said the Embassy could be in direct contact with him to discuss future cooperation projects . 
These could include the travel of [MISC Libyan  ] judges to the arbitration center in [LOC Tunis  ] , as well as a visit to the [LOC U.S.  ] Court of [ORG International Trade  ] . 
The enthusiasm and candor of the director were a welcome relief from the more cautious norm , and could help pave the way to broach more sensitive topics such as human rights and judicial reform in the context of future training programs . 
Experience has shown that while we forge a new relationship with the judicial institute , it will also be important to double-track future projects with the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] . 
In addition , the source of funding for this program ( [ORG MEPI  ] ) was not discussed during this visit ; [ORG MEPI  ] remains a neuralgic issue for conservative regime elements , who regard it as a vehicle for regime change . 
Most of the judges and attorneys who participated in the workshop had little or no previous direct experience with the [LOC U.S.  ] and therefore represented a new target audience for Embassy outreach .
