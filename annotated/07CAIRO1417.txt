[PER CAIRO  ] 974 <a id='parC' href='#parC'>¶</a>C . 
2006 CAIRO 2010 CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR FRANCIS [PER J. RICCIARDONE  ] , FOR REASONS 1.4 ( B ) AND ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION: PRESIDENTIAL SUCCESSION IS [ORG THE ELEPHANT  ] IN [ORG THE ROOM  ] OF [MISC EGYPTIAN  ] POLITICS . 
DESPITE INCESSANT WHISPERED DISCUSSIONS , NO ONE IN [LOC EGYPT  ] HAS ANY CERTAINTY ABOUT WHO WILL SUCCEED MUBARAK , OR HOW [ORG THE SUCCESSION  ] WILL HAPPEN . 
MUBARAK HIMSELF SEEMS TO BE TRUSTING TO GOD AND [ORG THE INERTIA  ] OF [ORG THE MILITARY  ] AND CIVILIAN SECURITY SERVICES TO ENSURE AN ORDERLY TRANSITION . 
IN [ORG THE CURRENT  ] POLITICAL FRAMEWORK , [ORG THE MOST LIKELY CONTENDERS  ] ARE PRESIDENTIAL SON GAMAL MUBARAK ( WHOSE PROFILE IS EVER-INCREASING AT [ORG THE RULING NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY  ] ) , EGIS CHIEF OMAR SOLIMAN , DARK HORSE ARAB LEAGUE SECRETARY GENERAL AMRE MOUSSA , OR AN AS-YET UNKNOWN MILITARY OFFICER . 
WHOEVER ENDS UP AS EGYPT'S NEXT PRESIDENT LIKELY WILL BE POLITICALLY WEAKER THAN MUBARAK . 
ONCE MUBARAK'S SUCCESSOR HAS ASSUMED [ORG THE POST  ] , HIS FIRST PRIORITY WILL BE TO BUILD POPULAR SUPPORT . 
WE THUS EXPECT THAT [ORG THE NEW  ] PRESIDENT WILL LIKELY ADOPT AN ANTI-AMERICAN TONE IN HIS INITIAL PUBLIC RHETORIC , IN AN EFFORT TO PROVE HIS NATIONALIST BONA FIDES TO [ORG THE EGYPTIAN  ] STREET , AND MAY POSSIBLY EXTEND AN OLIVE BRANCH TO [ORG THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD  ] , AS DID PREVIOUS [MISC EGYPTIAN  ] PRESIDENTS AT [ORG THE BEGINNING  ] OF THEIR TERMS . 
END SUMMARY. ------------------------------ LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR SUCCESSION ------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) PRESIDENT MUBARAK IS FOND OF OBSERVING THAT NO ONE SHOULD HAVE ANY QUALMS REGARDING HIS SUCCESSION , SINCE EGYPT'S CONSTITUTION PROVIDES A DETAILED GUIDE FOR HOW A SUCCESSION SHOULD PROCEED . 
AMONG [ORG THE RECENT CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS  ] WAS A NOTABLE CHANGE TO [ORG THE ARTICLE  ] DETERMINING WHICH OFFICIAL ASSUMES POWER IN [ORG THE EVENT  ] OF [ORG THE TEMPORARY  ] INCAPACITATION OF [ORG THE PRESIDENT  ] . 
[ORG ARTICLE  ] 82 , WHICH PREVIOUSLY DELINEATED THAT [ORG THE VICE-PRESIDENT  ] SHOULD ASSUME PRESIDENTIAL POWERS " IF ON ACCOUNT OF ANY TEMPORARY OBSTACLE [ORG THE  ] PRESIDENT IS UNABLE TO CARRY OUT HIS DUTIES , " HAS BEEN AMENDED SO THAT , IF THERE IS NO VICE-PRESIDENT , [ORG THE PRIME  ] MINISTER IS ASSIGNED PRESIDENTIAL POWERS . 
[ORG ARTICLE  ] 84 READS , " IN CASE OF [MISC THE VACANCY  ] OF [ORG THE PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE OR  ] [ORG THE PERMANENT  ] DISABILITY OF [ORG THE PRESIDENT  ] , " [ORG THE PRESIDENT  ] OF [MISC THE PEOPLE'S ASSEMBLY  ] ( [ORG PA  ] ) OR [ORG THE PRESIDENT  ] OF [ORG THE SUPREME CONSTITUTIONAL COURT  ] SHOULD TEMPORARILY ASSUME [ORG THE PRESIDENCY  ] . 
NEITHER WOULD SUBSEQUENTLY BE ALLOWED TO NOMINATE HIMSELF FOR [ORG THE PRESIDENCY  ] ; THERE IS NO SUCH STIPULATION AGAINST [ORG THE PM  ] RUNNING FOR [ORG THE OFFICE  ] . 
[ORG ARTICLE  ] 84 GOES ON TO STIPULATE THAT , " [ORG THE PRESIDENT  ] OF [ORG THE REPUBLIC  ] SHALL BE CHOSEN WITHIN A MAXIMUM PERIOD OF 60 DAYS FROM [ORG THE DAY  ] OF [MISC THE VACANCY  ] OF [ORG THE PRESIDENCY  ] . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) CONSTITUTIONAL [ORG ARTICLE  ] 76 , WHICH PREVIOUSLY WIRED [ORG THE EGYPTIAN  ] ELECTORAL FRAMEWORK TO GUARANTEE [ORG THE PRESIDENCY  ] TO [ORG THE RULING NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY  ] ( [ORG NDP  ] ) , WAS ALSO AMONG [ORG THE ARTICLES  ] AMENDED IN APRIL ( REF A ) . 
[ORG THE  ] CHANGE WILL OSTENSIBLY FACILITATE MORE COMPETITIVE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS , WHILE STILL PROTECTING AGAINST ANY SERIOUS CHALLENGE TO [ORG THE NDP  ] CANDIDATE . 
UNDER [ORG THE REVISIONS  ] TO [ORG ARTICLE  ] 76 , FOR AN INTERIM 10-YEAR PERIOD ( I.E. UNTIL 2017 ) , LEGAL POLITICAL PARTIES WHICH HOLD AN ELECTED SEAT IN [ORG THE PEOPLE'S ASSEMBLY  ] OR SHURA COUNCIL CAN NOMINATE A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE ( CURRENTLY , ONLY FOUR PARTIES MEET THIS REQUIREMENT - [ORG THE NDP  ] , [ORG AL GHAD  ] , [ORG AL WAFD  ] , AND TAGGAMU ) . 
FOLLOWING [ORG THE  ] INTERIM PERIOD , IN ORDER TO RUN A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: -- A PARTY HAS TO HAVE BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR AT [MISC LEAST  ] 5 YEARS PRIOR TO [ORG THE ELECTION  ] ; -- ITS CANDIDATE MUST HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF [ORG THE HIGHEST  ] LEADERSHIP BODY OF [ORG THE PARTY  ] FOR AT LEAST 1 YEAR ; AND , -- [ORG THE PARTY  ] WOULD HAVE TO HOLD AT LEAST 3% OF [ORG THE SEATS  ] IN BOTH PARLIAMENTARY HOUSES ( I.E. , 14 SEATS IN [MISC THE PEOPLE'S ASSEMBLY  ] , AND 6 SEATS IN [ORG THE SHURA COUNCIL  ] ) , OR 6% OF [ORG THE SEATS  ] IN EITHER [ORG THE PA OR  ] SHURA COUNCIL ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) GENUINELY INDEPENDENT CANDIDATES FACE AN ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE BAR TO ENTER [ORG THE RACE  ] . 
TO COMPETE IN THE NEXT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION , [ORG ARTICLE  ] 76 STATES THAT AN " INDEPENDENT " MUST OBTAIN ENDORSEMENTS FROM 250 ELECTED MEMBERS OF EGYPT'S NATIONAL AND LOCAL REPRESENTATIVE BODIES , OF WHICH THERE MUST BE A MINIMUM OF 65 ENDORSEMENTS FROM MEMBERS OF [ORG THE PEOPLES ASSEMBLY  ] , 25 FROM [ORG THE SHURA COUNCIL  ] , AND 10 FROM LOCAL COUNCILS IN AT LEAST 14 GOVERNORATES . 
THIS WOULD BE A NEAR UNATTAINABLE FEAT FOR A NON-NDP CANDIDATE TO ACHIEVE , GIVEN [ORG THE RULING PARTY'S  ] DOMINATION OF ALL [MISC EGYPTIAN  ] ELECTED BODIES . 
IN EFFECT , THE PROVISIONS OF [ORG ARTICLE  ] 76 ACCOMPLISH TWO OBJECTIVES REGARDING INDEPENDENTS: [ORG THE RULING  ] PARTY CAN BLOCK THE EMERGENCE OF ANY GENUINELY " INDEPENDENT " CANDIDATE , WHILE IT COULD THEORETICALLY REACH BEYOND THE NDP'S TOP LEADERSHIP TO SELECT AN " INDEPENDENT " WHOM THE RULING ELITE JUDGES WILL BEST PROTECT THEIR INTERESTS , PROVIDED [ORG THE NDP RETAINS PARTY DISCIPLINE.  ] -------------------- POTENTIAL CANDIDATES -------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) PRESIDENT MUBARAK , WHO BEGAN HIS FIFTH 6-YEAR TERM IN SEPTEMBER 2005 , RECENTLY TURNED 79 . 
THE NEXT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS DUE TO BE HELD IN 2011 . 
BY THE TIME MUBARAK SERVES HIS FULL TERM , THERE MAY BE OTHER CANDIDATES IN THE WINGS , OR MUBARAK HIMSELF COULD CHOOSE TO RUN AGAIN FOR THE PRESIDENCY . 
HE IS ON RECORD AS SAYING , IN A NOVEMBER 2006 SPEECH , THAT HE PLANNED TO REMAIN PRESIDENT " AS LONG AS I HAVE A HEART THAT BEATS , AND BREATH IN MY BODY . 
" BUT IF THE SUCCESSION HAPPENED TOMORROW , [MISC EGYPTIAN  ] PARLOR SPECULATION FOCUSES ON THE FOLLOWING AS POSSIBLE SUCCESSORS . 
GAMAL MUBARAK ------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) CAIRENE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM HOLDS THAT GAMAL WANTS THE JOB , DESPITE HIS REPEATED DENIALS TO THE CONTRARY ( REF B ) . 
[ORG THE MOST RECENT  ] SUCH ABJURATION WAS ON MAY 2 , DURING AN INTERVIEW WITH THE ORBIT SATELLITE TV CHANNEL , WHEN GAMAL STATED THAT , " I DO NOT HAVE THE INTENTION AND AMBITION TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT .. . 
WHATEVER THE PARTY SAYS DOES NOT MATTER . 
I AM NOT LOOKING FOR ANY EXECUTIVE POST . 
" SUCH COY DEMURRALS RING HOLLOW IN THE FACE OF HIS INCREASINGLY ROBUST ROLE WITHIN THE NDP ( FAR EXCEEDING THAT OF HIS COUNTERPARTS IN [ORG THE PARTY  ] HIERARCHY ) , HIS APPARENTLY CENTRAL ROLE IN CREATING NEW LEGISLATION , AND HIS RECENT TOURS TO VARIOUS GOVERNORATES FEATURING MINISTERIAL ENTOURAGES . 
IT IS HARD TO ARGUE THAT GAMAL IS NOT BEING GROOMED FOR [ORG THE PRESIDENCY.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) MANY IN [ORG THE EGYPTIAN  ] ELITE SEE HIS SUCCESSION AS POSITIVE , AS HIS LIKELY CONTINUATION OF [ORG THE CURRENT  ] STATUS QUO WOULD SERVE THEIR BUSINESS AND POLITICAL INTERESTS . 
GIVEN THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CANDIDACY , AND WEAK OPPOSITION LEADERSHIP , THERE ARE CURRENTLY FEW OTHER EGYPTIAN PERSONALITIES WITH [ORG THE NATIONAL STATURE  ] AND POLITICAL CAPITAL TO SERIOUSLY CONTEND FOR [ORG THE PRESIDENCY  ] . 
[LOC LIKEWISE  ] , DUE TO THE PARANOIA OF [ORG THE EGYPTIAN  ] DICTATORSHIP , NO OTHER NAME CAN SAFELY OR RESPECTFULLY BE BRUITED AS A CONTENDER . 
WHILE [ORG THE PRESIDENT'S  ] SON IS VULNERABLE TO OPEN CRITICISM FOR HIS PRESUMED AMBITION , HE IS [ORG THE ONLY  ] PERSON IN [LOC EGYPT  ] WHOSE TOTAL LOYALTY TO MUBARAK IS ALSO TAKEN FOR GRANTED , SO HIS IS [ORG THE ONLY  ] NAME THAT CAN POSSIBLY BE BANDIED ABOUT. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) A KEY STUMBLING BLOCK FOR A GAMAL CANDIDACY COULD BE [ORG THE MILITARY  ] . 
EACH OF EGYPT'S FOUR PRESIDENTS SINCE 1952 AROSE FROM [ORG THE OFFICER  ] CORPS , AND [ORG THE MILITARY  ] HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN [ORG THE ULTIMATE  ] GUARANTOR OF [ORG THE PRESIDENT'S  ] RULE . 
GAMAL DID NOT SERVE AS A MILITARY OFFICER , AND WE BELIEVE HE DID NOT COMPLETE HIS COMPULSORY SERVICE . 
MANY OBSERVERS OPINE THAT TIMING IS [ORG THE CRUCIAL  ] FACTOR FOR A POTENTIAL GAMAL PRESIDENCY - HIS POWER BASE IS HIS FATHER , AND SO WHILE HE COULD CONCEIVABLY BE INSTALLED PRIOR TO MUBARAK'S DEATH , [ORG THE TASK  ] WOULD BECOME FAR MORE DIFFICULT , ALTHOUGH NOT INSURMOUNTABLE , ONCE [ORG THE PHARAOH  ] HAS DEPARTED [ORG THE SCENE  ] , AND PERSONAL LOYALTIES TO HIM ARE IN [MISC THE PAST  ] . 
ALTHOUGH THERE IS WIDESPREAD POPULAR ANIMUS AGAINST A GAMAL CANDIDACY , WITH MANY EGYPTIANS OPINING PROUDLY THAT , " WE ARE NOT [LOC SYRIA  ] OR [LOC SAUDI  ] ! 
" , [ORG THE NDP MACHINERY  ] COULD LIKELY STAGE AN ELECTORAL VICTORY , BASED ON POOR VOTER TURNOUT , SLOPPY VOTER LISTS , AND STATE CONTROL OF [ORG THE ELECTION  ] APPARATUS . 
OMAR [ORG SOLIMAN  ] ------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) EGYPTIAN INTELLIGENCE CHIEF AND MUBARAK CONSIGLIERE , IN PAST YEARS [ORG SOLIMAN  ] WAS OFTEN CITED AS LIKELY TO BE NAMED TO [ORG THE LONG-VACANT  ] VICE-PRESIDENTIAL POST . 
IN [MISC THE PAST  ] TWO YEARS , [ORG SOLIMAN  ] HAS STEPPED OUT OF THE SHADOWS , AND ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE PHOTOGRAPHED , AND HIS MEETINGS WITH FOREIGN LEADERS REPORTED . 
MANY OF OUR CONTACTS BELIEVE THAT [ORG SOLIMAN  ] , BECAUSE OF HIS MILITARY BACKGROUND , WOULD AT THE LEAST HAVE TO FIGURE IN ANY SUCCESSION SCENARIO FOR GAMAL , POSSIBLY AS A TRANSITIONAL FIGURE . 
[ORG SOLIMAN  ] HIMSELF ADAMANTLY DENIES ANY PERSONAL AMBITIONS , BUT HIS INTEREST AND DEDICATION TO NATIONAL SERVICE IS OBVIOUS . 
HIS LOYALTY TO MUBARAK SEEMS ROCK-SOLID . 
AT AGE 71 , HE COULD BE ATTRACTIVE TO THE RULING APPARATUS AND [ORG THE PUBLIC  ] AT LARGE AS A RELIABLE FIGURE UNLIKELY TO HARBOR AMBITIONS FOR ANOTHER MULTI-DECADE PRESIDENCY . 
A KEY UNANSWERED QUESTION IS HOW HE WOULD RESPOND TO A GAMAL PRESIDENCY ONCE MUBARAK IS DEAD . 
AN ALLEGED PERSONAL FRIEND OF [ORG SOLIMAN  ] TELLS US THAT [ORG SOLIMAN  ] " DETESTS " THE IDEA OF GAMAL AS PRESIDENT , AND THAT HE ALSO WAS " DEEPLY PERSONALLY HURT " BY MUBARAK , WHO PROMISED TO NAME HIM VICE-PRESIDENT SEVERAL YEARS AGO , BUT THEN RENEGED . 
AMRE [ORG MOUSSA  ] ----------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) THE CHARISMATIC ARAB LEAGUE SECRETARY GENERAL PRUDENTLY HAS NEVER INDICATED INTENTION OR AMBITION TO ENTER INTO EGYPTS DOMESTIC POLITICAL FRAY , AND HAS NO EGYPTIAN INSTITUTIONAL POLITICAL PLATFORM FROM WHICH TO SPRING . 
HOWEVER , AS [ORG THE HIGH-PROFILE ELDER  ] STATESMAN OF ARAB CAUSES , HE ENJOYS CONSIDERABLE STREET CREDIBILITY , POPULARITY , AND PERCEIVED GRAVITAS . 
IT IS FAR-FETCHED BUT CONCEIVABLE THAT , IN A LEADERSHIP CRISIS FOLLOWING MUBARAK'S DEATH , [ORG MOUSSA  ] COULD EMERGE AS A PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDER , PROVIDED THAT HE IS AN NDP MEMBER , OR IF THE NDP WERE TO PROMOTE HIM UNDER THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS ALLOWED FOR INDEPENDENT CANDIDATES . 
MILITARY OFFICER ---------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) CURRENTLY , THERE IS NO OBVIOUS CONTENDER FROM AMONG THE OFFICER CORPS , EGYPT'S TRADITIONAL PRESIDENTIAL RECRUITMENT GROUNDS . 
MINISTER OF DEFENSE TANTAWI , A CONTEMPORARY OF MUBARAK'S , APPEARS TO HARBOR NO POLITICAL AMBITIONS . 
LIKE [ORG SOLIMAN  ] , HE COULD PLAY A ROLE IN CLEARING THE WAY FOR GAMAL , IF HE CALCULATES THAT IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE COUNTRY ; CONVERSELY , HE COULD ALSO BE A KEY PLAYER IN PREVENTING GAMALS ASCENDANCE . 
WE HAVE HEARD SOME LIMITED REPORTS OF TANTAWIS INCREASING FRUSTRATION AND DISENCHANTMENT WITH GAMAL ( REF B ) . 
IN THE EVENT OF A NATIONAL LEADERSHIP CRISIS , IT IS NEAR INCONCEIVABLE THAT GIVEN MUBARAK'S PERSONAL MANIPULATION OF THE OFFICE CORPS , THAT ANOTHER MILITARY OFFICER COULD EMERGE FROM OBSCURITY TO ASSERT HIMSELF AS A CANDIDATE . 
BUT TANTAWI AND HIS SENIOR COTERIE ARE NOT NECESSARILY POPULAR AT MID AND LOWER RANKS , SO THE POSSIBILITY OF A MID-20TH CENTURY STYLE COUP OF COLONELS CANNOT BE ENTIRELY DISCOUNTED . 
OPPOSITION MEMBER ----------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) OF THE 10 PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDERS IN 2005 , SECOND-PLACE [ORG AL GHAD  ] PARTY LEADER AYMAN NOUR IS CURRENTLY SERVING A SEVEN-YEAR JAIL TERM , AND ACCORDING TO EGYPTIAN LAW , WILL BE BANNED FROM PARTICIPATING IN EGYPTIAN POLITICAL LIFE FOR SEVERAL YEARS FOLLOWING HIS RELEASE . 
[ORG THE THIRD-PLACE FINISHER  ] , [ORG AL WAFD  ] PARTY CANDIDATE NO'MAN GOMAA , LOST HIS PARTY POSITION FOLLOWING A VIOLENT AND SCANDAL-RIDDEN LEADERSHIP STRUGGLE . 
[ORG THE  ] OTHER EIGHT CANDIDATES , MARGINAL FIGURES TO BEGIN WITH , HAVE FADED BACK INTO TOTAL OBSCURITY . 
CURRENT [ORG AL WAFD  ] LEADER MAHMOUD ABAZA IS A TALENTED POLITICIAN , BUT AT THIS POINT , DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE NATIONAL APPEAL OR ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY TO MOUNT A SERIOUS ATTEMPT AT THE PRESIDENCY . 
DARK HORSE AND ALSO RANS ------------------------ <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) POPULAR REFORMIST MINISTER OF TRADE RACHID IS A POTENTIAL CANDIDATE , THOUGH A DISTINCT [MISC DARK HORSE  ] . 
NONETHELESS , HE COMES FROM AN OLD AND RESPECTED FAMILY AND IS SEEN BY MANY AS LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR EGYPT'S IMPRESSIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH OF THE PAST THREE YEARS . 
INTERESTINGLY , THE HEAD OF CAIRO'S LARGE AND INFLUENTIAL AMCHAM , WHO KNOWS RACHID WELL , TOLD US THAT , AFTER NEGOTIATING THE CONTROVERSIAL QIZ PROGRAM , THE MINISTER " REALLY NEEDS MOVEMENT ON THE FTA FOR POLITICAL COVER , " RAISING THE QUESTION: POLITICAL COVER FOR WHAT ? 
WHILE IT IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY RACHID WOULD TAKE ON GAMAL HEAD-TO-HEAD , WE CANNOT DISCOUNT THE POSSIBILITY THAT HE WILLPLAY A ROLE IN A CARETAKER GOVERNMENT , AND MAY EENTUALLY EMERGE AS A LEADER. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) SAFWAT ELSHERIF ( NDP SECRETARY GENERAL AND SHURA COUNCIL PEAKER ) , MUFEED SHEHAB ( NDP ASSISTANT SYG , AND MINISTER OF STATE FOR LEGAL AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS , AND [PER ZAKARIA AZMY  ] ( NDP ASSISTANT SYG AND MUBARA'S DE FACTO CHIEF OF STAFF ) ALL , AS SENIOR LEADES OF THE NDP , MEET [ORG THE  ] CONSTITUTIONAL CRITERIA T RUN FOR OFFICE . 
NONE OF THESE GRIZZLED NDP VETERANS HAVE PUBLICLY EXPRESSED PRESIDENTIAL ASPIRATONS , NOR DO THEY APPEAR TO POSSESS ANY CAPABILITIE TO GOVERN , NOR PERSONAL CONSTITUENCIES . 
HOWEVE , WHILE UNLIKELY , IT IS POSSIBLE THAT , ONCE MUBAAK PERE IS OUT OF THE PICTURE , ONE OF THEM COULD EMERGE IN AN ANTI-GAMAL PARTY PUTSCH . 
FURTHERMORE . 
MOST ANALYSTS HERE BELIEVE THAT ANY GOVERNOR PUSHING FOR THE PRESIDENCY IS A FAR-FETCHED POSSIBILITY - [ORG THE OVERWHELMING  ] MAJORITY OF GOVERNORS ARE FORMER SENIOR MILITARY AND POLICE OFFICERS CHOSEN FOR THEIR LOYALTY , FAR FROM THE CRITICAL POLITICAL FRAY IN [LOC CAIRO  ] , AND WITH NO POWER BASES . 
[ORG MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD  ] ------------------ <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) WHILE THE SPECTER OF AN MB PRESIDENCY HAUNTS SECULAR EGYPTIANS , IT IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY IN THE IMMEDIATE POST-MUBARAK PERIOD . 
UNDER THE CURRENT LEGAL FRAMEWORK , THE MB HAS NO ABILITY TO PUT FORWARD A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN THE EVENT OF AN ELECTION . 
[ORG THE ORGANIZATION  ] DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE THE ORGANIZED MILITARY WING NECESSARY SHOULD IT WISH TO ATTEMPT TO SEIZE THE PRESIDENCY BY FORCE . 
CONSTANT OVERSIGHT OF THE ARMED FORCES AIMED AT ROOTING OUT POTENTIAL ISLAMIST SYMPATHIZERS MEANS THAT FEW LIKELY REMAIN , ALTHOUGH THE POSSIBILITY DOES EXIST THAT SOME CLOSE-MOUTHED MB-LEANING OFFICERS ARE PRESENT . 
OVERALL , IN THE VIEW OF MOST EGYPTIAN ANALYSTS , [ORG THE GROUP'S  ] APPROACH SEEMS TO BE ONE OF PATIENCE AND GRASS ROOTS BUILDING OF SUPPORT , WAITING FOR THE DAY WHEN IT MIGHT COME TO POWER THROUGH POPULAR ELECTION , OR BY POPULAR DEMAND AFTER A GAMAL PRESIDENCY HAS FOUNDERED. ------------------------ [ORG POST-SUCCESSION DYNAMICS  ] ------------------------ <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) WHOEVER EGYPT'S NEXT PRESIDENT IS , HE WILL INEVITABLY BE POLITICALLY WEAKER THAN MUBARAK , AND ONCE HE HAS ASSUMED THE POST , AMONG HIS FIRST PRIORITIES WILL BE TO CEMENT HIS POSITION AND BUILD POPULAR SUPPORT . 
WE CAN THUS ANTICIPATE THAT THE NEW PRESIDENT MAY SOUND AN INITIAL ANTI-AMERICAN TONE IN HIS PUBLIC RHETORIC , IN AN EFFORT TO PROVE HIS NATIONALIST BONA FIDES TO THE EGYPTIAN STREET , AND DISTANCE HIMSELF FROM MUBARAK'S POLICIES . 
IF HISTORY IS ANY GUIDE , WE CAN ALSO EXPECT THE NEW PRESIDENT TO EXTEND AN OLIVE BRANCH TO THE [ORG MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD  ] , AS DID GAMAL ABDEL NASSER , ANWAR EL SADAT , AND MUBARAK EARLY IN ALL OF THEIR TERMS , IN AN EFFORT TO CO-OPT POTENTIAL OPPOSITION , AND BOOST POPULARITY .
