( [ORG S/NF  ] ) SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST . 
With two months remaining before the Government of [LOC Brazil  ] decides on a next generation fighter aircraft , the [LOC U.S.  ] competitor , [ORG Boeing  ] 's [MISC F18  ] [ORG Super Hornet  ] is still perceived by many [MISC Brazilians  ] in and outside the GOB as a likely second or even third-place finisher , despite having the best aircraft and best offset package . 
Most [MISC Brazilian  ] contacts tell us that they do not believe the [ORG USG  ] is supporting the sale strongly , raising doubts in their minds about our long term reliability as a partner . 
Between now and July , there will be several opportunities to assure the [MISC Brazilians  ] at senior levels that the [ORG USG  ] will be behind the sale . 
Paragraphs 3-7 below contain proposed steps to address key [MISC Brazilian  ] concerns and maximize chances for selection of the [LOC U.S.  ] competitor . 
Among these steps , high level contacts , especially by the President and Secretary will be critical to overcome the perception of a lack of [LOC U.S.  ] support . 
We also need to underscore our assurances that technology transfer has been approved and highlight the superiority of [ORG Boeing  ] 's proposal to that of its [MISC French  ] competitor . 
As noted reftels , Embassy believes State will play a critical role in roviding assurances that will be essential to a winning bid . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) As the [MISC FX2  ] competition moves into its final stages , the [LOC U.S.  ] has a strong offer from [ORG Boeing  ] for the [MISC F18 Super Hornet  ] that comes with a huge package of industrial cooperation and a competitive overall cost . 
While we can be confident that the [ORG Super Hornet  ] would be [LOC Brazil  ] , s choice based on its superior capabilities and attractive offset package , it still has no better than a fifty/fifty chance of success because of political support for the [MISC French  ] competitor and a lingering belief among some [MISC Brazilian  ] leaders that a close relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] may not be to [LOC Brazil  ] , s advantage . 
Winning the [MISC FX2  ] endgame , therefore , will depend on an effective strategy to overcome our political disadvantages and allow the [ORG Super Hornet  ] , s superiority be the deciding factor . 
Such a strategy must address several key issues: Perception of a lack of [ORG USG  ] support ----------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) With the [MISC French  ] sale effort being managed directly from President [PER Sarkozy  ] , s cabinet and ongoing [MISC Swedish  ] engagement on the Ministerial level , the [ORG USG  ] is perceived by most [MISC Brazilians  ] as lukewarm at best in its support for the [MISC FX2  ] sale . 
This is a critical disadvantage in a [MISC Brazilian  ] society that depends on personal relationships as a foundation for business . 
The difficulty is exacerbated by the separation between government and industry in the [LOC United States  ] . 
We cannot , for example , offer government financing to support a state owned company as can our competitors . 
To address this problem , high level contacts will be essential , particularly from the [ORG Department of State  ] which is assumed by the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Air Force  ] to be restrictive of mil-mil ooperation . 
In such contacts , [LOC U.S.  ] officials will need to highlight expanding [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] partnership and how cooperation with the [LOC United States  ] as [LOC Brazil  ] modernizes its obsolescent military will not only provide the best operational capabilities , but will enhance our overall cooperation . 
This is why we have been forward leaning in approving transfers of technology in support of this sale . 
In addition to taking advantage of the near-term opportunities for high level contacts presented by [PER MOD Jobim  ] , s May 20 visit to [LOC Washington  ] And Secretary [PER Clinton  ] , s possible visit to [LOC Brazil  ] in late May , Embassy believes that phone calls between Presidents [PER Obama  ] and [PER Lula  ] , between [ORG NSA Jones  ] and [ORG Presidential Foreign Affairs Advisor Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] , and between [ORG SecDef  ] Gates and [PER MOD Jobim  ] , would boost our case significantly . 
Tech Transfer ------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Although the major decisions to approve the [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000634 002 OF 003 transfer of technology for the [MISC FX2  ] sale have been made , [MISC Brazilian  ] leaders continue to doubt [LOC U.S.  ] ability to follow through . 
While the problem has been mitigated by an effective public affairs strategy , we still hear that , absent specific high level [ORG State Department  ] assurances , the [MISC Brazilians  ] cannot be sure . 
It may well be that the [MISC Brazilians  ] want to keep tech transfer doubts alive in order to have a ready-made excuse for buying an inferior plane , should political leaders decide to do so . 
Repeated concerns about unreleasable source code could have a similar basis . 
Finally , we have heard that there are concerns on [PER Capitol Hill  ] about the possibility of a [MISC South American  ] arms race . 
Should these reach [MISC Brazilian  ] ears , there will be additional worries that [ORG Congress  ] will intervene to block the sale . 
Embassy recommends the following as next steps to strengthen our case on tech transfer: -- An advocacy letter from President [PER Obama  ] to President [PER Lula  ] -- A letter from Secretary [PER Clinton  ] to [PER MOD Jobim  ] stating that the [ORG USG  ] has approved the transfer of all appropriate technology . 
-- Interagency guidance on source code ( cleared for April Revista Forca Area article ) should be disseminated for use . 
-- All high-level contacts , including by Secretaries of State and Defense and POTUS should include reassurance that tech transfer has been approved . 
-- [LOC Washington  ] agencies should begin consultations with appropriate [PER Hill  ] staff as early as possible to overcome misperceptions that arms sales to [LOC Brazil  ] could be destabilizing . 
Financing --------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [LOC U.S.  ] inability to offer government financing or guarantees puts the [ORG Super Hornet  ] at a significant disadvantage to its competitors . 
[ORG EXIM  ] is prohibited from engaging in sales of defense articles , leaving [LOC Brazil  ] to depend on commercial financing at higher rates . 
According to [LOC Washington  ] agencies , it would be possible to seek [ORG Congressional  ] relief for [ORG EXIM  ] to support the sale . 
This has been done in the past on rare occasions . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Air Force  ] finance office has told us that even a statement that we are willing to seek such legislative action would be considered a positive sign . 
Embassy recommends that [LOC Washington  ] explore the possibility of legislative action to allow [ORG EXIM  ] Financing and respond by the May 29 deadline to the GOB request to provide information on government financing options . 
Making the Case --------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) We have been successful in getting across the points that the [ORG Super Hornet  ] is a highly capable aircraft , and now need to focus on the broader picture -- how partnership on the fighter sale will yield benefits for both sides both in military terms and in economic benefits . 
As the world , s largest aerospace company , [ORG Boeing  ] is able to offer a much greater scope of opportunities for [MISC Brazilian  ] industry , including some outside of the [MISC FX2  ] offset program . 
The early June visit of [MISC Brazilian  ] legislators to [LOC Washington  ] will be an opportunity to get the message to political leaders . 
By focusing on key [MISC Senators  ] , we have the opportunity to bring on board individuals who can influence the decision makers and ensure that the people who will have to approve spending [MISC Brazilian  ] government money understand that the [MISC F18  ] offers them the best value . 
Embassy will continue to highlight tech transfer and Expand our message to include economic benefits to [LOC Brazil  ] of the [ORG Boeing  ] proposal . 
We also recommend the following: -- Make an expert on the aerospace industry available for interview to highlight economic health of [ORG Boeing  ] compared to its competitors . 
-- Use visit of [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Congress  ] to drive home message that partnership with the [LOC U.S.  ] entails benefits to both sides that go well beyond offset program . 
Ensure that [MISC Brazilian  ] Senators understand significantly lower life cycle costs of the [ORG Super Hornet  ] . 
[LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000634 003 OF 003 -- Arrange for an interview of the [ORG SecDef  ] , or other senior Administration representative , with a prominent [MISC Brazilian  ] journalist to underline importance of [MISC U.S.-Brazilian  ] partnership and how the [MISC FX2  ] sale will help . 
Attack the [MISC French  ] Bid --------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Although the [MISC French  ] offer a less capable fighter at a higher cost , the [MISC Rafale  ] has been the presumptive winner since the inception of the [MISC FX2  ] competition . 
While the technical evaluations of the aircraft should result in a significant advantage for the [ORG Super Hornet  ] , we need to take steps to erode the [MISC French  ] political edge . 
While a major element of this will be highlighting [ORG Boeing  ] , s lower cost , there are several other measures that can make a case against the [MISC French  ] . 
The first step will be to remind the [MISC Brazilians  ] that their interest in the [MISC Rafale  ] was driven by an assumption that the [LOC United States  ] would not release technology . 
Since we have approved release of the relevant technology , we should ask if [LOC Brazil  ] still needs the [MISC French  ] as a safety . 
Over the last few months , the [MISC French  ] sales effort has been based on a misleading , if not fraudulent , claim that their plane involves only [MISC French  ] content ( rendering it free of meddlesome [LOC U.S.  ] export controls ) . 
This is not the case . 
A [ORG DTSA  ] analysis found a high level of [LOC U.S.  ] content , including targeting systems , radar components and safety systems that will require [LOC U.S.  ] licenses . 
Next steps: -- Although it does not appear that the tech data provided with the [MISC French  ] bid violated [ORG ITAR  ] regs , [ORG PM/DDTC  ] and [ORG DTSA  ] should continue to monitor [MISC French  ] marketing to ensure [ORG Dassault  ] does not skirt [ORG ITAR  ] restrictions . 
-- [ORG Investigate India  ] , s decision to drop the [MISC Rafale  ] from its fighter competition to see if there is a reason that would make the aircraft less attractive to [LOC Brazil  ] . 
-- Ensure the [MISC Brazilians  ] are aware that we expect to be issuing retransfer licenses for [MISC U.S.-origin  ] components on the [MISC French  ] plane and have already approved transfer of some technical data .
