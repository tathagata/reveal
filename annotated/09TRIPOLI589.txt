REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: Director of the [ORG MFA  ] 's [ORG International Organizations Department  ] , [PER Mahdi Al-Majribi  ] , elaborated July 21 on the [ORG UN  ] reform agenda laid out in [PER Qadhafi  ] 's July 15 speech at the [LOC NAM Summit  ] . 
Absent [ORG NAM  ] agreement on the way forward for expanded [ORG UNSC  ] membership , [PER Al-Majribi  ] expected [PER Qadhafi  ] to call for the addition of an [ORG African Union  ] seat to the [ORG UNSC  ] as an " interim " plan until the [ORG UNSC  ] is ready to add seats for other nations or groups of nations representing the developing world. xxxxxxxxxxxx [PER Al-Majribi  ] appears to be one of the principal [MISC Libyan  ] players on [ORG UN  ] reform issues . 
End summary . 
[ORG UNSC  ] EXPANSION AT TOP OF LIBYA'S [ORG UNGA  ] AGENDA 2 . 
( C ) During a July 21 meeting with the [ORG CDA  ] and P/E Chief , Director of the [ORG MFA  ] 's [ORG International Organizations Office  ] , [PER Mahdi Al-Majribi  ] , hinted at [LOC Libya  ] 's likely agenda for the [ORG UNGA  ] presidency . 
Prefacing his comments by saying that the [ORG UNGA  ] agenda is not set unilaterally by the [ORG UNGA  ] president , he noted that [ORG UN  ] reform would likely be a top priority for the 64th General Assembly . 
He said that he had been studying [ORG UN  ] reform for several years , and had " contributed information " on the [ORG UN  ] reform process to various parts of the [ORG GOL  ] . 
3 . 
( C ) [PER Al-Majribi  ] pointed to [PER Qadhafi  ] 's July 15 [ORG NAM  ] conference remarks and their focus on [ORG UN  ] reform -- and expansion of the [ORG Security Council  ] -- as indicative of [MISC Libyan  ] goals for the [ORG UNGA  ] . 
[PER Al-Majribi  ] , who accompanied [PER Qadhafi  ] to the [LOC NAM Summit  ] , said that although the [ORG NAM  ] countries agreed in principle on the need for expanded [ORG UNSC  ] membership , they had not arrived at a consensus regarding the proper representational breakdown - whether it be individual representatives of each continent or groups of nations represented by regional organizations such as the [ORG African Union  ] ( [ORG AU  ] ) . 
As an interim solution , [PER Al-Majribi  ] said that [PER Qadhafi  ] proposed adding an [ORG AU  ] seat , the representation of which would be decided within the [ORG AU  ] secretariat . 
[PER Al-Majribi  ] hinted repeatedly that he found the prospects for an [ORG AU  ] seat on the [ORG Security Council  ] to be unrealistic , pointedly noting that the [ORG UN Charter  ] did not call for regional organizations to be represented on the [ORG Security Council  ] . 
4 . 
( C ) [PER Al-Majribi  ] underlined [PER Qadhafi  ] 's belief that the [ORG UNSC  ] was comprised of [MISC World War II  ] winners , none of which understand the contemporary positions and needs of the developing world . 
As such , [PER Al-Majribi  ] believed that [PER Qadhafi  ] would press for the [ORG UNSC  ] to add seats , first for the [ORG AU  ] , then for the rest of the developing world - which [PER Al-Majribi  ] specified as [MISC Latin America  ] and [LOC Asia  ] ( outside of [LOC China  ] ) . 
[PER Mjribi  ] likened the [ORG UN  ] to a still lake , which needed to be stirred in order for life to resurface - though he offered a pragmatic assessment that true reform of the [ORG UN  ] , whether on the order of the [ORG GA  ] or [ORG SC  ] , would be a long-term process . 
ANOTHER [ORG AU  ] SUMMIT - MAYBE , BUT LIKELY 5 . 
( C ) Although [PER Al-Majribi  ] did not have specific information regarding [ORG GOL  ] plans to hold a second extraordinary [LOC AU Summit  ] on the margins of the 40th Anniversary of [PER Qadhafi  ] 's September 1 Revolution , he did say that if a summit were to take place , it would most likely be a day-long event in [LOC Sirte  ] . 
[ Note: This information correlates with what [PER Ali Treiki  ] told the Ambassador July 15 and with rumors we have heard from other interlocutors ( septel ) . 
End note . 
] [PER Al-Majribi  ] stated that the [ORG AU Secretariat  ] may have to endorse the idea of holding another extraordinary summit . 
6 . 
( C ) Comment and Bio Note: While reluctant to divulge too much information , [PER Al-Majribi  ] seemed to be an intelligent , skilled interlocutor on [ORG UN  ] issues . 
He said that he has spent 30 years working on multilateral issues for the [MISC Libyan  ] Government , including 9 years in multilateral missions abroad , including [LOC Vienna  ] . 
Given the depth of his comments on [ORG UN  ] reform and his detailed knowledge of the [ORG UN Charter  ] and structure , he is likely one of the principal players within the [MISC Libyan  ] bureaucracy on [ORG UN  ] reform . 
Although he struck an extremely pragmatic tone in his discussion with us , he also was very careful to parrot and elaborate upon the points [PER Qadhafi  ] made in [LOC Sharm El Sheikh  ] . 
It will be interesting to observe how much of [PER Al-Majribi  ] 's pragmatism makes it into [MISC Libyan  ] negotiations during [ORG UNGA  ] .
