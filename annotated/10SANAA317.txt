[ORG SANAA  ] 214 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Stephen Seche  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . 
This is an action request: see paragraph 12. <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Summary: Since  ] the start of 2010 , Post has seen a dramatic increase in the number of [MISC Amcits  ] arrested . 
Over 80 percent of these cases ( REF A-E ) have had a nexus to terrorism and national security issues that have required substantial involvement from [ORG RSO  ] and [ORG LEGATT  ] . 
This comes as the [ORG Consular Section  ] is attempting to alleviate its six-month backlog in upcoming [MISC CRBA  ] appointments . 
Post requests TDY personnel to assist with the anticipated staffing gaps in Consular from April to September and renews its call to increase [ORG FSO  ] staffing ( REF F ) to address the sharply increased workload . 
End Summary . 
Arrests of [MISC Americans  ] Up , New [ORG ROYG Procedures  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Post has noted a dramatic increase in arrests of [MISC Americans  ] in [LOC Yemen  ] since the attempted [MISC Christmas Day  ] bombing of Northwest 253 . 
In the last seven weeks , seven [MISC Amcits  ] were arrested for national security concerns and violations of immigration laws ( Ref A-E ) , compared to only six in the entire four months prior . 
Six of these cases have suspected links to terrorism that have required significant coordination with [ORG LEGATT  ] and [ORG RSO  ] . 
Comment: This upsurge in arrests is the result of more scrupulous [ORG ROYG  ] focus on visa overstay cases due to increased international attention to terrorism in [LOC Yemen  ] . 
End Comment. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Previously , a visa overstay would present himself at the immigration authority , pay his fines , and obtain an exit visa . 
Recently , however , overstays have been detained and have required post intervention in securing their exit from [LOC Yemen  ] . 
Four of the arrestees were 'abducted' by the [ORG Political Security Organization  ] ( [ORG PSO  ] ) or [ORG National Security Bureau  ] ( [ORG NSB  ] ) and were held for between 3-10 days before post was given official notice of their whereabouts . 
Note: In the past two years , the [MISC Muslim  ] convert community of [MISC Amcits  ] living in [LOC Yemen  ] ) who make up the majority of overstays - has been increasingly linked to extremist activities . 
End Note . 
In one case , Post has still not received official word of the arrest and is unable to inform the family in the [LOC US  ] , who still believes the individual has been kidnapped . 
The issue of timely notification of arrests was recently raised by post 's [ORG DCM  ] with the [MISC Yemeni  ] Chief of Protocol . 
Direct Namecheck Hits Increasing -------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In addition to the spike in arrest cases , post routinely sees cases of national security interest in the course of its daily visa and [MISC American  ] citizen services ( [ORG ACS  ] ) operations . 
On average , post has 3-5 cases per week that require [ORG LEGATT  ] and [ORG RSO  ] attention . 
The processing time required to clear these hits and allow time for additional interviews is increasingly straining our ability to provide routine services in a timely fashion . 
Comment: Post had reduced appointment wait time for first-time [MISC CRBA  ] applications from six months to three months . 
We will not be able to continue such high appointment numbers given the recent increase in arrest cases and our current staffing levels . 
End Comment . 
Status of Arrestees ------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Post is currently processing five arrest cases , most of which have begun as welfare and whereabouts requests , or visa overstays . 
A sixth , who was not a national security or terrorist case , was recently released . 
All five that remain have had strong links to terrorism or national security concerns . 
The following is an update on these cases. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ( REF A ) was being held at the [ORG Passport Authority  ] pending further investigation into both his visa overstay and possible links to terrorism . 
[ORG ROYG  ] previously attempted to deport [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
He was denied boarding , however , due to his presence on the no fly list ( [ORG NFL  ] ) . 
Post had requested guidance from [LOC CA  ] on this matter ( REF G ) , as per applicable FAM [ORG NFL  ] guidance . 
Post , s [PER A/RSO-I  ] received a call from [LOC Consulate Istanbul  ] , s [PER A/RSO-I  ] ( REF H ) that [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] arrived in [LOC Istanbul  ] on February 16 , but was denied onward travel to the [LOC U.S  ] due to his [ORG NFL  ] status . 
Post later received notice that [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] is scheduled to board [ORG Turkish Airlines  ] flight [ORG TK1236  ] to [LOC Sanaa  ] on February 17 ( REF I ) . 
Note: [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] no longer has a valid [MISC Yemeni  ] visa and airport visas are no longer available ( REF J ) . 
End [LOC Note.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ( REF B ) is being held at the [ORG PSO  ] prison . 
He is currently still under investigation by the [ORG PSO  ] , which plans to deport him . 
No date for his release has been set . 
[ORG FBI  ] and DS plan to meet him in the [LOC US  ] upon his return. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ( REF C ) is being held by the [ORG Passport Authority  ] and is awaiting deportation . 
Currently , [ORG ROYG  ] authorities are waiting for Mr. [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] to secure an itinerary and tickets to the [LOC US  ] before his release. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ( Ref D ) is also being held at the [ORG PSO  ] prison . 
He is currently being investigated for his links to terrorism . 
The [ORG ROYG  ] has not given any information regarding possible charges. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ( Ref E ) is currently being held at the [ORG Immigration Authority  ] prison pending possible deportation . 
It is currently unclear if Mr. [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] will be able to pay his overstay fines and obtain a standard exit visa to return to the [LOC US  ] or if he will be deported . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Post currently has five full-time officers assigned to the consular section and one part-time officer . 
Prison visits must occur during morning hours pulling officers away from visa and [ORG ACS  ] cases . 
This increase in workload has pushed our already strained operation beyond capacity and has hampered our ability to work through existing backlogs in [ORG ACS  ] and [ORG IV  ] . 
In REF F and through Diplomacy 3.0 , post requested at least one additional [ORG ACS  ] officer based on workload and staffing in [LOC FY09  ] . 
Post 's workload in [ORG IV  ] has increased by 5,722 cases or over 2.5 times from FY08 to [LOC FY09  ] . 
Additionally , post 's [ORG NIV  ] workload increased by 918 adjudications , up nearly a third from FY08 to [LOC FY09  ] . 
End Comment . 
ACTION REQUEST -------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Post renews its call for a full-time FS-03 [ORG ACS  ] officer and FS-04 Vice Consul , and requests TDY support to cover officer leave and the anticipated staffing gap from April through September . 
In addition , post requests experienced [MISC Arabic-speaking  ] LE Staff and officer TDY support as soon as possible to assist in working through backlogs in [ORG ACS  ] and [ORG IV  ] . 
Post fully expects that the trends of increasing arrests and direct hit cases will continue and looks forward to a positive and expeditious response to this request .
