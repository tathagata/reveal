Additional [ORG CT Plans/Programs After  ] Van [MISC Gogh Murder  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
Prior to a scheduled Nov. 11 debate on the van [MISC Gogh  ] murder , [ORG Justice Minister Donner  ] , Interior Minister [PER Remkes  ] and [ORG Immigration Minister  ] [PER Verdonk  ] sent a letter to the [ORG Second Chamber  ] containing the Government 's proposals in response to recent explosions of violent radicalism . 
The [ORG Ministers  ] want the [ORG AIVD  ] intelligence service to: - expand the surveillance of persons in any way related to terrorism , radicalization processes ; - conduct a more intensive search for yet unknown radicalized or extremist individuals not linked to networks and/or individuals already known to justice and security services ; and - intensify sharing of analyzed information and risk indicators to enable other government organizations and local authorities to carry out their tasks and responsibilities and play a role in combating terrorism and radicalization . 
The [ORG Ministers  ] also promised to establish a special terrorism unit within the [ORG National Crime Squad  ] and to make more resources available to protect public persons and property. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
The Government also plans to attack the causes of [MISC Islamic  ] radicalism by improving social-economic prospects for young [MISC Muslims  ] with special employment and anti-discrimination programs . 
It will develop an action program to promote awareness of the dangers of radicalization by distributing information against radical-political ideas of [MISC Islam  ] and setting up a network of individuals to respond in event of emerging radicalization in individuals or groups. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
The Government said it would pursue tougher action , including expulsion from the [LOC Netherlands  ] , against [MISC Muslim  ] ministers , teachers , ideologists and [ORG Imams  ] if their activities are contrary to the law or public order . 
If activities of a legal person , including mosques , are contrary to public order , the public prosecutor will be able to ask the court to ban and dissolve the legal entity . 
The [ORG Ministers  ] plan to employ criminal and other options and powers to ensure discontinuation of unacceptable behavior and views , including use of alien law , financial supervision and control and political administrative measures . 
Foreigners wishing to disseminate radical [MISC Islamic  ] ideologies will be denied permission to reside in the country . 
The Government also said it would shortly introduce a bill enabling authorities to rescind the [MISC Dutch  ] nationality of individuals possessing dual nationality who pose a threat to the vital interests of the State . 
Parliamentary Debate -------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
All political parties not only endorsed the Government 's proposals , but also asked for even tougher measures during the Nov. 11 debate in the [ORG Second Chamber  ] . 
For instance , right-wing parties , including government coalition member [ORG VVD  ] , asked for immediate closure of radical mosques , and a [ORG Chamber  ] majority wanted to set up [MISC Dutch  ] training centers for [ORG Imams  ] and terminate issuing residence permits for foreign [ORG Imams  ] as of 2008 . 
The [ORG Chamber  ] also asked the Government to see whether it would be possible to prevent foreign radio and television stations spreading hatred and violence . 
The debate continues . 
[ORG Justice Ministry Draft  ] Bill on Other [ORG CT Measures  ] --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
Also on Nov. 11 , [PER Donner  ] sent a draft bill containing other [LOC CT  ] measures to outside organizations for review and comment . 
These measures , initially announced in early September ( reftel C ) , would approve the [ORG Cabinet  ] 's plan creating a [ORG National CT Coordinator 's Office  ] and expand use of special investigative powers ( phone taps , infiltration and surveillance ) in cases of possible terrorist attacks . 
In addition , [PER Donner  ] wants to expand the scope for collecting information , remanding individuals in custody and carrying out preventive body searches . 
For example , under the bill , the public prosecutor would be able to designate certain areas/locales where preventive body searches , as well as searches of vehicles and property , could be carried out ( for instance in the case of large sports events ) . 
In security risk areas , such as airports , railway stations and government buildings , [PER Donner  ] wants the police to be able to search individuals and vehicles without prior approval by the public prosecutor . 
Comment ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
The assassination of van [MISC Gogh  ] has shaken the [MISC Dutch  ] and the Government is moving on a variety of fronts to confront the threat of terrorism and radicalism . 
Nonetheless , [MISC Dutch  ] society with its tradition of consensus and respect for personal liberty moves very slowly . 
It took the Government more than 2 years to enact the [LOC CT  ] measures it proposed following the 9/11 attacks . 
While these proposals contain some helpful law enforcement methods , it may be a long time before the police and intelligence services can use them .
