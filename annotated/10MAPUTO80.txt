( [ORG S/NF  ] ) SUMMARY: [LOC Mozambique  ] has been called the second most active narcotics transit point in [LOC Africa  ] after [LOC Guinea  ] [ORG Bissau  ] ( Ref C ) . 
Despite anti-corruption rhetoric , the ruling [ORG FRELIMO  ] party has not shown much serious political will to combat narcotrafficking . 
[PER Mohamed Bashir Suleman  ] ( [ORG MBS  ] ) , described as the largest narcotrafficker in [LOC Mozambique  ] , has direct ties to President [PER Guebuza  ] and former President [PER Chissano  ] . 
Other traffickers bribe both high and low level officials . 
Chief of Customs [PER Domingos Tivane  ] is a significant recipient of these narcotrafficking-related bribes . 
Police officials told [ORG Embassy  ] officers that they are unwilling to go after " big fish " narcotraffickers because of their ties to senior officials . 
The [ORG Ministries of Interior and Finance  ] have recently back-pedaled on [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to engage and assist in narcotrafficking and money laundering , a significant associated problem . 
The management of the port of [LOC Nacala  ] , infamous for allowing the flow of drug transshipments from southwest [LOC Asia  ] , was recently taken over by [PER Celso Correia  ] , principal of [LOC Insitec  ] , Ltd , a [PER Guebuza  ] front company . 
A new casino law reduces gambling restrictions in [LOC Mozambique  ] , providing another avenue for money laundering . 
[LOC U.S.  ] support to [LOC Border Security  ] and the [MISC Mozambican  ] military ( [ORG FADM  ] ) has resulted in modest seizures of money and drugs . 
Post looks forward to an upcoming INL visit to help elaborate a comprehensive counter-narcotics trafficking ( [ORG CNT  ] ) strategy . 
Any such [ORG CNT  ] strategy , after first gauging political will which at this point is suspect , should consider the strengthening of land and maritime border security , professionalization of the police force , educational programming for prosecutors on [MISC Mozambican  ] [ORG CNT  ] laws already in place , and development of a financial intelligence capability . 
END SUMMARY. -------------------------------------------- NARCOTRAFFICKERS BLANDISHING [ORG GRM  ] AND [ORG FRELIMO  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Mohamed Bashir Suleman  ] ( [ORG MBS  ] ) , described by multiple contacts as the largest narcotrafficker in [LOC Mozambique  ] , contributes heavily to [ORG FRELIMO  ] 's coffers , and has provided significant financial backing to the campaigns of former President [PER Joaquim Chissano  ] and current President [PER Armando Guebuza  ] . 
( [ORG Note: See TD-314/085221-09  ] regarding written communication from the [ORG Office of the Presidency  ] directing certain containers be exempted from standard scanning and scrutiny at the Port of [LOC Maputo  ] . 
End Note . 
) Traffickers , including [ORG MBS  ] , [PER Gulam Rassul  ] , and the [ORG Ayoub Family  ] ( Ref A ) routinely bribe police , immigration and customs officials to ensure that drugs can enter the country . 
[PER Domingos Tivane  ] , Chief of the [ORG Customs Service  ] , is a significant recipient of bribes from narcotraffickers ( Ref B ) , and he recently purchased real estate in [LOC Maputo  ] valued at well beyond what his government salary should be able to afford. ------------------------------------------ POLICE UNWILLING TO PURSUE MANY DRUG CASES ------------------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Senior members of the [MISC Mozambican  ] Police ( PRM ) have told [PER Emboffs  ] that potential [ORG CNT  ] training would only help them with small-scale traffickers , while other " big fish " would remain too large to catch . 
Of the more than ten cocaine and heroin seizures in 2009 at the [LOC Maputo  ] airport , none have resulted in prosecutions . 
A senior law enforcement official has admitted to [PER Emboffs  ] that most drug seizures are not made public and not prosecuted because police and customs officials use such seizures to enrich themselves . 
Such officials extract bribes , and may retain the drugs seized for resale . 
Despite repeated requests , the Minister of Interior ( charged with overall responsibility for police and for counter-narcotics ) has refused to meet with the [ORG CDA  ] to discuss increased joint [ORG CNT  ] efforts . 
The [ORG GRM  ] recently raised objections to an offer for a [ORG U.S. Department of Treasury  ] official to be embedded into the [MISC Financial Crimes Unit  ] , after initially agreeing to and supporting the offer. --------------------------------------------- PROVINCIAL PORTS ATTRACTIVE FOR DRUG TRANSITS [ORG MAPUTO  ] 00000080 002 OF 002 --------------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The port of [LOC Nacala  ] in particular is believed to be a major recipient of narcotics from [LOC Southwest Asia  ] . 
In July 2009 , [PER Celso Correia  ] , who is a principal in [LOC Insitec  ] , Ltd , ( a company whose major shareholder is President [PER Armando Guebuza-septel  ] ) , was installed as head of the [ORG Northern Development Corridor  ] ( [ORG CDN  ] ) which includes the port of [LOC Nacala  ] and the northern rail network . 
Shortly thereafter , [PER Ghulam Rassul Moti  ] , who has smuggled hashish and heroin into northern [LOC Mozambique  ] since at least 1993 ( Ref B ) greatly reduced bribes to local [LOC Nacala  ] and [LOC Nampula  ] municipal authorities and made the payments instead directly to senior [ORG FRELIMO  ] officials . 
[ORG Nampula Mayor  ] [PER Castro Serafim  ] was reported to be particularly irritated that these monthly payments had been re-routed straight to higher-level [ORG FRELIMO  ] leaders. -------------------------------- NEW CASINO LAW CAUSE FOR CONCERN -------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) In January , President [PER Guebuza  ] signed into law a new " Casino Bill . 
" Passed by the [ORG National Assembly  ] ( [ORG AR  ] ) in June 2009 , the law relaxes restrictions on gambling in [LOC Mozambique  ] , reducing the minimum investment for a casino from $15 to $8 million , legalizing online gambling , and allowing slot machines to be positioned in otherwise non-gambling environments . 
The law also passes financial control of casinos from the [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] to the less rigorous [ORG Ministry of Tourism  ] . 
This bill was passed to encourage tourism ; however , given [LOC Mozambique  ] 's minimal financial controls , the law will effectively reduce the barriers to narcotraffickers looking to launder funds . 
[PER Nazir Lunat  ] , a [ORG FRELIMO  ] parliamentarian and influential imam in [LOC Maputo  ] , recently resigned from his position in the [ORG National Assembly  ] ( [ORG AR  ] ) because of concerns over the law allowing casino liberalizations. ------------------------------------- USG SUPPORT HAS HAD POSITIVE OUTCOMES ------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) With USG support , there has been some progress in combating drug trafficking . 
Using INL funds , [ORG Embassy Maputo  ] , working with the [ORG Embassy  ] of [LOC Portugal  ] , provided training to border guards which resulted in the seizure of [LOC U.S.  ] $2.5 million in cash and the arrest of two [MISC Pakistani  ] smugglers ( Ref E ) . 
In mid-May 2009 police seized [LOC U.S.  ] $5 million in heroin at the [LOC Ressano Garcia  ] border crossing into [LOC South Africa  ] . 
Employing 7-meter , rigid hull inflatable boats donated by the [ORG DoD  ] using Section 1206 funds , the [MISC Mozambican  ] navy has interdicted several drug shipments near the coast , most recently in December. ------------------------------------------ COMMENT: COMPREHENSIVE CNT STRATEGY NEEDED ------------------------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) Post looks forward to an upcoming INL visit to help elaborate a comprehensive [ORG CNT  ] strategy . 
USG interests in [LOC CNT  ] in [LOC Mozambique  ] involve multiple USG departments , including [ORG State  ] , [ORG DoD  ] , [ORG DoJ  ] , [ORG DHS  ] , and [ORG Treasury  ] . 
Our [ORG CNT  ] strategy must first address ways to strengthen the [ORG GRM  ] 's political will to address narcotrafficking , while preparing [LOC Mozambique  ] with a host of programs , to include strengthening of land and maritime border security , professionalization of the police force , educational programming for prosecutors on [MISC Mozambican  ] CNT laws already in place , and development of a financial intelligence capability.</pre></code>
