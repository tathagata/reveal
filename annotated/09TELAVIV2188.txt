Some commentators raised doubts about ShalitQs condition . 
A [ORG Jerusalem Post  ] survey found that the likelihood of ministers in [PER Netanyahu  ] 's cabinet voting in favor of a deal involving ShalitQs release is higher than during [PER Ehud OlmertQs  ] more left-leaning cabinet . 
Yediot reported that 33 Left and Right-leaning heads of pre-military educational institutions wrote DM [PER Ehud Barak  ] that ShalitQs release should not come at any price .

The [ORG Jerusalem Post  ] wrote that the violence that has erupted in [LOC Jerusalem  ] 's [LOC Old City  ] in the past few days can be seen in the context of the [ORG PA  ] leadership 's attempts to divert attention from what a [MISC Palestinian  ] minister described as " one of the worst scandals since the establishment of the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] .

He was quoted as saying that the understandings were supposed to remain secret . 
Another official claimed that the decision was taken by [PER Fayyad  ] , who did not consult with [PER Abbas  ] . 
However , sources close to [PER Fayyad  ] denied the claim and accused [MISC Abbas'  ] advisers of exploiting the scandal to defame the [ORG PA  ] prime minister and get rid of him . 
Yediot also cited mutual accusations among the [ORG PA  ] leadership .

[PER Michael Mullen  ] , the Chairman of the [ORG Joint Chiefs  ] of Staff , and Gen. [PER Georges Georgelin  ] , the chief of the [MISC French  ] Defense Staff . 
The meeting focused on assessments regarding [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Syria  ] , [ORG Hizbullah  ] , and the joint [MISC Israeli-U.S  ] . 
Juniper Cobra defense exercise that is scheduled later this month . 
The exercise will include the [MISC Israeli  ] [ORG Arrow  ] missile defense system as well as three [MISC American  ] systems -- the [LOC THAAD  ] , Aegis , and PAC3 -- that will all be deployed in [LOC Israel  ] for the duration of the exercise . 
Analyzing Assistant Secretary of State [PER Michael PosnerQs  ] address to the [ORG U.N.Qs Human Rights Council  ] , The [ORG Jerusalem Post  ] wrote that the [LOC U.S.  ] came out strongly in favor of the [MISC Israeli  ] position on the matter , but left a door open for an external probe of [MISC Operation Cast Lead  ] . 
[PER HaQaretz  ] reported that a video tape made during a guided tour of the archaeological excavations at [LOC Silwan  ] ( the [ORG City of David  ] ) near [LOC Jerusalem  ] 's [LOC Old City  ] walls reveals how [MISC Elad  ] , the association that runs the dig , works together with the [ORG Israel Antiquities Authority  ] , the [ORG Israel Nature  ] and [ORG Parks Authority  ] , and the [LOC Jerusalem  ] municipality to dig under the homes of [MISC Arab  ] residents -- potentially endangering them . 
[PER HaQaretz  ] reported that Vice PM [PER Moshe YaQalon  ] recently canceled a planned trip to [LOC Britain  ] for fear of being arrested there for his role in the assassination of senior [ORG Hamas  ] terrorist [PER Salah Shehadeh  ] in July 2002 .

" If This Is How [PER Obama  ] Handles the [MISC Olympics  ] " Columnist [PER Shmuel Rosner  ] , who was HaQaretzQs correspondent in [LOC Washington  ] , wrote in the popular , pluralist [ORG Maariv  ] ( 10/5 ) : [ORG QA  ] weakened [PER Obama  ] is also more dangerous to [LOC Israel  ] -- because a weakened [PER Obama  ] is a weakened [LOC United States  ] . 
And a weakened [LOC United States  ] means less chances of applying effective pressure on [LOC Iran  ] , an increased chance that additional countries will decide to ignore WashingtonQs political messages , and an increased concern that the global cop will lose his ability to prevent chaotic developments . 
One should hope that he will learn from his failures and his accrued experience . 
But one must take into account the fact that [LOC Israel  ] , too , will pay the tuition fee . 
And the payment might be heftier than a settlement freeze or the evacuation of an outpost... . 
Thus , it is not sure whether one should be happy with the hurdles on ObamaQs road . 
II . 
" Complete the Exchange " The independent , left-leaning [ORG Ha'aretz  ] editorialized ( 10/4 ) : QPrime Minister [PER Benjamin Netanyahu  ] and his representative in the negotiations [ over the release of [PER Gilad Shalit  ] ] , [PER Haggai Hadas  ] , have changed the program for the talks that was set forth by their predecessors , former Prime Minister [PER Ehud Olmert  ] and his representative , [PER Ofer Dekel  ] . 
The [MISC German  ] mediator who joined the efforts has gained the trust of both parties and created a new mechanism for dialogue , whose first result has been the exchange of the tape for the female prisoners . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] has succeeded in keeping the details of the talks secret... . 
Now [PER Netanyahu  ] needs to complete the deal , bring back [PER Shalit  ] , and put an end to this painful affair... . 
Yesterday [PER Noam Shalit  ] accused the QState of [LOC Israel  ] and its decision makersQ of omissions that have needlessly prolonged his son 's captivity . 
His pain is understandable , and his claims merit thorough examination , but now the Government needs to focus on achieving a reasonable compromise with [ORG Hamas  ] , which would allow [PER Shalit  ] to return home to his family and country . 
III . 
" The [MISC Public Has Decided  ] " Liberal columnist and television anchor [PER Ofer Shelach  ] wrote in the popular , pluralist [ORG Maariv  ] ( 10/4 ) : [ORG QFrom  ] now on , the release of [ the video recording including [PER Shalit  ] ] , which has great significance in the negotiating process , will be like something that is self-understood , a procedure that cannot be overridden... . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] has apparently made a final decision to go for a deal , and thatQs definitely legitimate. --------- 2 . 
Iran: --------- [PER Block Quotes:  ] ------------- <a id='parI' href='#parI'>¶</a>I . 
" [LOC Iran  ] Sidetracks the World " The conservative , independent [ORG Jerusalem Post  ] editorialized ( 10/5 ) : QNo matter how the [LOC U.S.  ] intelligence reassessment goes , or how [LOC Iran  ] 's export gambit plays out , or what happens when the inspectors visit [LOC Qom  ] , at the end of the day -- and in keeping with the mullahs' strategy -- [LOC Iran  ] will have bought time... . 
At this point , there are only three possibilities: ( a ) [LOC Iran  ] will build a bomb ; ( b ) draconian sanctions , spearheaded by [LOC Washington  ] , will persuade [LOC Teheran  ] to abort its program ; ( c ) military intervention will significantly set the mullahs back . 
Assuming [PER Obama  ] realizes that the second option is by far the most preferable , he must not allow [LOC Tehran  ] to sidetrack the discussion . 
All the world needs to know is when [LOC Iran  ] will stop enriching uranium , and when it will end its weapons program . 
II . 
" Peace in Exchange for the Bomb " Senior op-ed writer [PER Akiva Eldar  ] commented in the independent , left-leaning [ORG Ha'aretz  ] ( 10/5 ) : QIt is certainly possible that the ayatollah regime seeks to mislead the [MISC Americans  ] in order to buy more time to complete its nuclear program . 
But what will we do if the [MISC Iranians  ] surprise [PER Obama  ] with an offer to rid the [LOC Middle East  ] of nuclear weapons and to help establish peace throughout the entire region ? 
It is so convenient for us to remain tied to the policy of ambiguity on both issues . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] needs to prepare himself for the possibility that [LOC Iran  ] will redeem its concessions vis-a-vis its nuclear program with [MISC Israeli  ] concessions over the territories .
