( C ) Summary: Reports by the [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] ( [ORG QDF  ] ) that detained human rights activist [PER Fathi  ] el-Jahmi was " released " to the custody of his family appear to be premature . 
Security officials continue to effectively control access to el-Jahmi at the [ORG Tripoli Medical Center  ] . 
His family 's access has improved but is not unconditional , and his ability to regularly leave his room for exercise and home visits remains the subject of negotiations with the [ORG QDF  ] . 
According to his doctor , el-Jahmi 's medical condition has improved and he could be released to his home for continuing treatment on an outpatient basis . 
[PER El-Jahmi  ] and his family are concerned that access to medical treatment might be curtailed if he were released from the hospital . 
Representatives of [ORG Human Rights Watch and Physicians for Human Rights  ] have arrived in [LOC Tripoli  ] and are scheduled to visit el-Jahmi today for independent assessments of his status and medical condition . 
End summary . 
[PER FATHI  ] EL-JAHMI " RELEASED " 2 . 
( C ) Citing statements by [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] ( [ORG QDF  ] ) human rights director [PER Saleh Abdulsalam  ] , international media reported on March 11 that detained human rights activist [PER Fathi  ] el-Jahmi ( [ORG FAJ  ] ) was " released " , but remained at the [ORG Tripoli Medical Center  ] for treatment . 
( [PER Note: El-Jahmi  ] has been in the [ORG GOL  ] 's custody since his re-arrest in early 2004 . 
End note . 
) P/E Chief spoke with [ORG QDF  ] Executive Director [PER Dr. Yusuf Sawani  ] on March 12 . 
[PER Sawani  ] carefully stressed that el-Jahmi had been " transferred " from the custody of the [ORG GOL  ] to the custody of his family , noting that since he had not been in detention ( from the [ORG GOL  ] 's perspective ) , he could not have been " released " . 
Referencing the el-Jahmi family 's delay in responding to the [ORG QDF  ] 's earlier offers to allow el-Jahmi to return home ( ref A ) , [PER Sawani  ] said the family had " finally " agreed to take custody of him . 
A March 12 [ORG Reuters  ] report quoted el-Jahmi 's son , [PER Muhammad  ] , as saying: " We ~ are very happy with the improvement in his health , particularly now that he can see us continuously . 
I am now responsible for his needs -- food , drink and everything . 
" BUT REMAINS AT [LOC TRIPOLI  ] [ORG MEDICAL CENTER  ] 3 . 
( C ) [PER Sawani  ] said the [ORG QDF  ] had proposed transferring el-Jahmi to his family home in [LOC Tripoli  ] or to a private clinic . 
The family told the [ORG QDF  ] they could not accommodate el-Jahmi at home and raised concerns about the cost of private clinic care , suggesting the [ORG QDF  ] underwrite those expenses . 
After consulting with [ORG FAJ  ] 's treating physicians at the [ORG Tripoli Medical Center  ] ( [ORG TMC  ] ) and , according to [PER Sawani  ] , with the family , it was decided that the best course of action was to keep el-Jahmi at the government-run [ORG TMC  ] , where the state pays for his treatment " as it would with any [MISC Libyan  ] citizen " . 
4 . 
( C ) Asked whether [PER Emboffs  ] could visit el-Jahmi , [PER Sawani  ] stressed that the [ORG GOL  ] no longer has custody of [ORG FAJ  ] . 
As such , neither the [ORG GOL  ] nor the [ORG QDF  ] had any mandate to facilitate access to el-Jahmi , who was ostensibly free to come and go as he pleased . 
[PER Sawani  ] cautioned that " as with any patient in hospital " , [PER Emboffs  ] would have to coordinate a visit with el-Jahmi 's family , who were now responsible for him . 
" It is for the family alone to decide whether a visit would be appropriate " , he said . 
FAMILY VISITS 5 . 
( C ) P/E Chief spoke by telephone March 12 with el-Jahmi 's eldest son , [PER Muhammad  ] , and daughter , [PER Lamia  ] , who said access to el-Jahmi for the family had recently improved . 
A number of el-Jahmi 's immediate family were able to visit about one week ago . 
In the last three days , [PER Muhammad  ] el-Jahmi and his mother visited daily for long periods ( his wife stayed seven hours on March 11 ) , and were able to bring him food and sundry items . 
[PER Muhammad  ] el-Jahmi said that on March 10 he had to coordinate their visit with the [ORG QDF  ] ; however , on March 11 and March 12 he and his mother only had to telephone the hospital before visiting . 
[PER Muhammad  ] asked the [ORG QDF  ] on March 12 whether el-Jahmi could exit his room regularly for exercise to alleviate edema in his legs , and whether he might be able to make a visit home . 
The [ORG QDF  ] " agreed in principle " , but details of those arrangements are still being sorted out . 
6 . 
( C ) Asked whether [PER Emboffs  ] could visit el-Jahmi , [PER Muhammad  ] and [PER Lamia  ] stressed that the family was not in a position to sanction or coordinate visits , and suggested that Post contact the [ORG QDF  ] . 
Standing permission for access to him at this point extends only to [PER Muhammad  ] and his mother . 
The family had no objection to a [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000220 002 OF 003 visit by [PER Emboffs  ] if the [ORG QDF  ] agreed . 
MINDERS STILL PRESENT 7 . 
( C ) P/E Chief visited el-Jahmi on March 12 in his [ORG TMC  ] hospital room , located directly across from a nurse 's station . 
When the duty nurse was asked which room el-Jahmi was in , two plainclothes security officers standing in front of el-Jahmi 's room approached and asked who wanted to see him and why . 
The hospital 's " security director , " after determining that the visit had been coordinated with the [ORG QDF  ] and the family , said P/E Chief could see al-Jahmi after el-Jahmi finished his evening prayers and supper . 
TREATING PHYSICIAN SAYS IMPROVEMENT IN MEDICAL CONDITION CONTINUES 8 . 
( C ) While waiting , P/E Chief spoke by phone with el-Jahmi 's treating physician , [PER Dr. Abdulrahman Mehdy  ] , who said el-Jahmi 's condition had continued to improve since [PER Emboffs  ] last visited el-Jahmi on February 20 . 
El-Jahmi 's EKG readings were close to normal , his breathing was less labored , he tired less easily and the edema in his legs had begun to ease . 
[PER Mehdy  ] said el-Jahmi could , in his judgment , be released from hospital immediately and could continue treatment on an outpatient basis with visits to clinic once every week or two , a significant improvement since just three weeks ago . 
El-Jahmi had undergone a complete battery of tests , to include EKG and CBC , blood sugar and lipids profile blood tests on March 12 , and would undergo a sonogram on March 13 . 
Doctors had discovered that el-Jahmi 's vision had deteriorated when he was recently allowed reading material again ; el-Jahmi 's eyes were tested and new spectacles prescribed on March 12 . 
EL-JAHMI IN GOOD SPIRITS 9 . 
( C ) After a wait of about an hour , P/E Chief saw el-Jahmi , who was accompanied by his wife , son [PER Muhammad  ] and a man described as his nurse , [PER Abdullah Bashir  ] . 
[PER El-Jahmi  ] was visibly tired , but was alert and appeared to be in good spirits . 
He made his first walk of any distance earlier that day to have his eyes tested in a clinic located in a different wing of the hospital . 
Excited about having left his room for the first time in long while , he expressed frustration that the edema in his legs had not subsided more quickly . 
( Note: His physician said he had started el-Jahmi on a different analgesic medication about one week ago to help ease swelling in his legs , and that the initial signs were good . 
End note . 
) 10 . 
( C ) El-Jahmi said his condition had improved recently . 
He was permitted to raise the blinds in his room about one week ago , allowing him a view and some sunlight . 
His [MISC Koran  ] had been returned to him , although reading had been difficult until his new spectacles had been prescribed . 
He had been allowed trips outside his room more regularly , and understood that he would be allowed to begin regular walks soon to help his heart and edema . 
Most importantly , his family had been able to visit regularly . 
Asked whether he needed anything , he stressed two things: continued medical treatment and his freedom . 
His medical condition had improved considerably since treatment began in December 2007 ; however , further treatment was needed . 
He and his family were concerned that access to treatment might be curtailed - directly or indirectly - if he were released from the hospital . 
[LOC Unbidden  ] , el-Jahmi stressed that while he wants to go home , he remains unwilling to enter into a tacit agreement to refrain from criticizing al-Qadhafi 's regime or speaking publicly about his detention as the price for his release . 
He was unaware until told by P/E Chief that representatives of [ORG Human Rights Watch  ] ( [ORG HRW  ] ) and [ORG Physicians for Human Rights  ] ( [ORG PHR  ] ) were , with the [ORG QDF  ] 's facilitation , scheduled to visit him in the coming days . 
He expressed relief that the international community remains focused on his case , saying he felt he had been " walking alone in the wilderness " for a long time . 
11 . 
( C ) Comment: While we lack the expertise to comment authoritatively on el-Jahmi 's medical condition , he appeared to have improved since our last visit with him in February ( ref B ) . 
Unfettered access and , should he choose , the ability to: 1 ) leave his room , and: 2 ) leave the [ORG TMC  ] are important measures of whether he has in fact been " transferred " from [ORG GOL  ] custody to that of his family . 
Security officials remain outside his room and effectively control access to him , and his ability to leave his room regularly for exercise and/or home visits is apparently being negotiated with the [ORG QDF  ] , suggesting he remains for practical purposes under [ORG GOL  ] custody . 
The distinction between [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000220 003 OF 003 el-Jahmi having been at the [ORG TMC  ] in the [ORG GOL  ] 's custody and his being there now in the custody of his family is at best a subtle one . 
It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the [ORG QDF  ] 's announcement of el-Jahmi 's " release " was orchestrated as window dressing on the eve of the visit by [ORG HRW  ] and [ORG PHR  ] representatives . 
An important component of any agreement for his release will be specific agreement on the terms of his continued medical treatment . 
End comment .
