( C ) Poloff met with [MISC Brazilian  ] DCM [PER Vilmar Coutinho  ] ( please protect ) to discuss the May 30-31 visit to [LOC Cuba  ] of [MISC Brazilian  ] foreign minister [PER Celso Amorim  ] . 
[PER Amorim  ] 's visit was a follow-up to [MISC Brazilian  ] President [PER Lula da Silva  ] 's January 2008 visit to [LOC Cuba  ] ( [LOC Reftel  ] ) . 
In addition to meeting with his counterpart , [MISC Cuban  ] Foreign Minister [PER Felipe Perez Roque  ] , [PER Amorim  ] also met with [MISC Cuban  ] President [PER Raul Castro  ] . 
[PER Coutinho  ] himself did not attend this meeting , although [MISC Brazilian  ] Ambassador [PER Bernardo Pericas Neto  ] did , as the lone [ORG GOB  ] representative . 
VP [PER Carlos Lage  ] , FM [PER Perez Roque  ] , and Minister of [ORG Basic Industries Marta Lomas Morales  ] also attended the meeting between [PER Amorim  ] and [PER Raul Castro  ] . 
The encounter was described as largely a social one , with the substantive meeting having occurred earlier between [PER Amorim  ] and [PER Perez Roque  ] , which [PER Coutinho  ] had attended . 
[PER Pericas  ] informed [PER Coutinho  ] that [PER Raul Castro  ] appeared confident and comfortable in his role as [LOC Cuba  ] 's leader , and described [PER Castro  ] as being well-informed on a range of issues pertaining to the [LOC Brazil-Cuba  ] bilateral relationship. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Coutinho  ] noted that the [ORG GOB  ] had not requested an audience with [PER Raul Castro  ] , though they were hoping the [ORG GOC  ] would announce that [PER Castro  ] wished to meet with [PER Amorim  ] . 
[MISC Venezuelan  ] FM [PER Nicolas Maduro  ] had received an audience with [PER Castro  ] a week earlier , and the [MISC Brazilians  ] felt that it would be a significant gesture if the [ORG GOC  ] made [PER Castro  ] available . 
[PER Coutinho  ] added that [MISC Cuban  ] FM [PER Perez Roque  ] received an audience with [MISC Brazilian  ] President [PER Lula  ] during an earlier visit to [LOC Brazil  ] , and consequently the [ORG GOB  ] felt they were owed reciprocal treatment . 
[PER Amorim  ] also pressed for a commitment by [PER Raul Castro  ] to visit [LOC Brazil  ] , but the latter would only say that [LOC Brazil  ] would be " one of the first countries he would consider " for his first trip as head of state. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) According to [PER Coutinho  ] , during [PER Amorim  ] 's conversation with [PER Raul Castro  ] , the [MISC Cuban  ] leader stated that he had no intention of lifting the " tarjeta blanca " restriction on foreign travel by [MISC Cuban  ] citizens at anytime in the near future . 
In response to a query from [PER Amorim  ] , [PER Castro  ] stated firmly that lifting this restriction would result in [MISC Cubans  ] departing the island en masse , the bulk of them heading for [LOC Mexico  ] . 
[PER Castro  ] believed this exodus would negatively influence the bilateral relationship between [LOC Mexico  ] and [LOC Cuba.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Castro  ] also denied that any significant change to [LOC Cuba  ] 's dual-currency system was in the works . 
While he conceded that the [ORG Convertible Peso/Ordinary Peso  ] system created deep divisions in [MISC Cuban  ] society , he stated that any change in the exchange rate to favor the ordinary peso would spike inflation in [LOC Cuba  ] and lead to devastating food shortages. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Coutinho  ] described [PER Amorim  ] 's proclamation to the press that [LOC Brazil  ] wanted to become [LOC Cuba  ] 's primary trade partner as " unrealistic . 
" He noted that [LOC Brazil  ] was not in a position to usurp [LOC Venezuela  ] given the hefty subsidies offered to [LOC Cuba  ] annually by [PER Chavez  ] . 
Instead , [PER Coutinho  ] noted that [PER Amorim  ] 's words were more a symbol to the [ORG GOC  ] of the seriousness with which [LOC Brazil  ] viewed its relationship with [LOC Cuba.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Coutinho  ] noted that [LOC Brazil  ] saw two concrete benefits from expanding ties with [ORG Cuba:  ] 1 ) [LOC Brazil  ] perceives [LOC Cuba  ] to be influential within international organizations such as the [ORG NAM  ] , and views [LOC Cuba  ] 's support as key in securing a permanent seat on the [ORG UN Security Council  ] , and 2 ) [LOC Brazil  ] is seeking to assert itself as a world power beyond [LOC South America  ] , and sees [LOC Cuba  ] as a stepping stone into the [LOC Caribbean  ] and beyond. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [LOC Brazil  ] remains firmly committed to not broach the subject of human rights with [LOC Cuba  ] . 
[PER Coutinho  ] said that doing so would " poison " the environment . 
He asserted that [PER Raul Castro  ] only expressed an interest in meeting with [PER Amorim  ] because he knew the [ORG GOB  ] would not discuss human rights. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The topic of [PER Fidel Castro  ] was not raised during [PER Amorim  ] 's meeting with [PER Raul Castro.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) COMMENT: [LOC Brazil  ] sees the establishment of good relations with [LOC Cuba  ] as the cornerstone of its [LOC Caribbean  ] policy and very much desires a reciprocal visit from [PER Raul Castro  ] . 
As [PER Coutinho  ] notes , the trade aspects of the relationship get lip service , but the [MISC Brazilians  ] seem realistic about business opportunities in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
[PER Raul Castro  ] may wish very much to make [LOC Brazil  ] one of his first foreign visits in order to cement further an economic relationship that can balance the inordinate influence of [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
However , to do so he will either have to visit [LOC Venezuela  ] first or have the internal political strength to overcome the perceived snub to [LOC Cuba  ] 's number one ally that would accrue from going first to [LOC Brazil  ] . 
At the moment neither option may be acceptable .
