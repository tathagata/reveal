END SUMMARY. ---------------------------- [PER De Kerchove’s  ] [ORG EU  ] Perspective ---------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) On his tenth day of travels within the [ORG EU  ] , Ambassador [PER Williamson  ] met in [LOC Brussels  ] February 17 with [ORG EU  ] [ORG Counterterrorism Coordinator Gilles  ] de [PER Kerchove  ] . 
The [ORG C/T Coordinator  ] briefly discussed his upcoming whitepaper on detainee issues , which was tasked to him by the [ORG EU  ] Council . 
It will include 15 “non-controversial” principles to guide [ORG EU  ] consensus building , as well as lessons learned from the Church of the Nativity resettlement ( ref A ) , information on previous [LOC U.S.  ] policies and the new executive order , and potential resettlement options outside and within the [ORG EU  ] . 
Ambassador [PER Williamson  ] provided general information on the number of released detainees who had reengaged in terrorism , as well as the distinction between “cleared for release” and “cleared for transfer” designations by the [MISC USG.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) On forming an [ORG EU  ] position , [PER De Kerchove  ] indicated that a favorable scenario would be a consensus agreement allowing individual members to accept detainees , provided transfers are not forced on any unwilling [ORG EU  ] member . 
[PER Williamson  ] noted that the [MISC Czechs  ] , in their capacity as [ORG EU  ] president , were committed to developing this consensus position . 
The two then went on to discuss concerns over former detainees’ freedom of movement in the [LOC Schengen  ] zone . 
[PER Williamson  ] stated that it is a common concern among [ORG EU  ] members , and floated the possibility of former detainees having restrictions placed on their travel , a stipulation that some of the detainees and their lawyers have consented to in principle . 
[PER De Kerchove  ] replied that a precedent existed for such restrictions , which he felt could help mitigate [LOC Schengen  ] concerns of member states , though they would be difficult to enforce in practice . 
The Ambassador cited the February 26 , 2009 Justice and Home Affairs Informal Meeting as an important near-term milestone in building momentum towards an [ORG EU  ] position . 
[PER De Kerchove  ] was of the opinion that it was a bit early to expect an official position given the complex nature of the issue . 
He had hoped discussions would occur first among ambassadors within the [ORG Committee of Permanent Representatives  ] , however the [MISC Czech  ] [ORG Presidency  ] insisted on moving forward with discussions among Justice and Interior Ministers. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Conversation then shifted to the USG process moving forward . 
[PER Williamson  ] described two parallel [LOC U.S.  ] review processes ; ( 1 ) review of the files of all 242 detainees at [LOC BRUSSELS  ] 00000269 002 OF 003 [LOC Guantanamo  ] , and ( 2 ) review of policies involving detention , [LOC Guantanamo  ] , and related issues . 
Files must be collected from multiple departments , agencies , and locations for review by an interagency team , including [ORG DOJ  ] prosecutors and representatives from the State , [LOC Defense  ] , and [ORG Homeland Security  ] departments , as well as the intelligence agencies . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] will prioritize cases of detainees being considered for resettlement by [ORG EU  ] governments. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Williamson  ] and [PER De Kerchove  ] agreed to consult further after the February 26 JHA Informal meeting and before anticipated travel by JHA Commissioner [PER Jacques Barrot  ] , [MISC Czech  ] Interior Minister [PER Langer  ] , and [PER De Kerchove  ] to [LOC Washington  ] in mid [MISC March.  ] ------------------------- “We need better pictures” ------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) During a subsequent meeting on February 17 with [PER Riina Kionka  ] , High Representative [PER Javier Solana’s Personal Representative  ] for [ORG Human Rights  ] , Ambassador [PER Williamson  ] briefed on the process called for by the President’s recent executive orders on closure of [LOC Guantanamo  ] detention facilities , and exchanged views on the state of play regarding [ORG EU-level  ] efforts on acceptance of [LOC Guantanamo  ] detainees. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) While emphasizing that [ORG EU  ] [ORG Counter-Terrorism Coordinator Gilles  ] de [PER Kerchove  ] had the lead on this issue , [PER Kionka  ] raised a few specific concerns and ideas . 
She told us that Member States have been under intense pressure from [LOC China  ] not to accept Uighurs , and that some are concerned about possible repercussions in bilateral and [ORG EU-level  ] relations with [LOC China  ] if they accept detainees . 
She acknowledged that this pressure was not unusual from [LOC China  ] , but did not know if it would affect Member State decision-making. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Kionka  ] also highlighted the gap between public perceptions of the kinds of detaines at [LOC Guantanamo  ] and the reality that many ar very low risk . 
She felt that this was a message the [LOC U.S.  ] had to carry , and urged the administration to “plainly” explain to [MISC Americans  ] ( and thus [MISC Europeans  ] ) that while some detainees are very dangerous , many of them do not pose a serious threat . 
[PER Kionka  ] also commented that whenever a [MISC European  ] newspaper ran a story on [LOC Guantanamo  ] , they ran the typical picture of a hunched-over detainee in an orange jumpsuit . 
She said that “we need better pictures” and urged us to turn the story around by showing low-risk detainees in a better light. --------------------- Parliamentary support --------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Amb . 
[PER Williamson  ] hosted a lunch for three Members of the [MISC European  ] Parliament ( [PER MEP  ] ) who were the principal authors of a recent resolution supporting [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to close [LOC Guantanamo  ] and [ORG EU  ] efforts to assist with detainee resettlement . 
MEPs [PER Ursula Gacek  ] ( [LOC EPP-ED  ] , [LOC Poland  ] ) , [PER Baroness Sarah Ludford  ] ( [LOC ALDE  ] , [LOC UK  ] ) , and [PER Jan Marinus Wiersma  ] ( [LOC PSE  ] , [LOC Netherlands  ] ) told us that the results of the vote ( 542 in favor , 55 abstaining , 51 opposed ) show the broad bipartisan support that the [ORG EP  ] has for [MISC European  ] resettlement efforts . 
They said that it was difficult to craft a text that all parties could support , but that the [ORG EP  ] felt it was important to express a “helpful” sentiment . 
[PER Williamson  ] expressed appreciation for their efforts in securing passage of the resolution and indicated that it sent a positive message to [ORG EU  ] states considering resettlements. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The MEPs were careful to point out that the support was not unqualified . 
Legal issues surrounding the admission of detainees into the [ORG Schengen Zone  ] needed to be resolved to the satisfaction of Member States not accepting detainees , they said . 
[PER MEP Ludford  ] , known to be somewhat outspoken , drew criticism from her colleagues when she spoke of her personal opinion that Member States who participated in alleged [ORG CIA  ] [LOC BRUSSELS  ] 00000269 003 OF 003 rendition operations to [LOC Guantanamo  ] had a particular ethical responsibility to accept detainees if it would contribute to the closure of the facility . 
She noted that the [ORG EP  ] would adopt a resolution on [ORG CIA  ] flights at that week’s plenary session. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( U ) Ambassador [PER Williamson  ] has cleared on this telegram .
