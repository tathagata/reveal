REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: Contrary to claims by the [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] ( [ORG QDF  ] ) that detained human rights activist [PER Fathi  ] el-Jahmi was discharged from hospital on/about May 8 and returned to his family home in [LOC Tripoli  ] , el-Jahmi remains at the [ORG Tripoli Medical Center  ] and his current medical condition is uncertain . 
Family members visited him on May 14 -- their first visit in over one month -- and expressed concern to P/E Chief for their safety and unease with Embassy involvement in the case . 
End comment . 
FINDING EL-JAHMI 2 . 
( C ) Per ref A instructions , the [ORG CDA  ] called [ORG QDF  ] Executive Director Dr. [PER Yusuf Sawani  ] on May 13 to inform him that an [MISC Emboff  ] would visit the [ORG Tripoli Medical Center  ] ( [ORG TMC  ] ) on May 14 in an effort to confirm that detained human rights activist [PER Fathi  ] el-Jahmi had in fact been discharged from hospital and returned to his family home in [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
[ORG CDA  ] noted that the Embassy had been unable to reach the family to ascertain el-Jahmi 's whereabouts . 
( Note: As reported ref B , [PER Sawani  ] informed the [ORG CDA  ] on May 8 that el-Jahmi had been discharged from the [ORG TMC  ] and had returned to his home to recuperate . 
End note . 
) [PER Sawani  ] phoned the [ORG CDA  ] the following day , May 14 , and said that the [ORG QDF  ] had no objection to a hospital visit , but repeated that el-Jahmi had returned to his home in [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
Pressed by the [ORG CDA  ] as to whether el-Jahmi was at the [ORG TMC  ] or at his home in [LOC Tripoli  ] , [PER Sawani  ] equivocated , saying he " believed " el-Jahmi was at his home , adding that he " may " have returned to the [ORG TMC  ] because of his heart condition . 
3 . 
( C ) On May 14 , P/E Chief visited the room at the [ORG TMC  ] in which el-Jahmi had been previously been housed . 
Five plainclothes security officials encountered on previous visits were in and around the room . 
El-Jahmi was not in the room ; the senior security official told P/E Chief el-Jahmi was in another wing undergoing x-rays and other undefined diagnostic procedures . 
Staff at the nurses' station located directly across from el-Jahmi 's room , clearly nervous about being seen to speak with P/E Chief , declined to state whether el-Jahmi had ever been discharged from the [ORG TMC  ] as claimed by [PER Sawani  ] on May 8 . 
P/E Chief overheard security officials placing numerous telephone calls , including several to the [ORG QDF  ] . 
4 . 
( C ) After waiting for approximately an hour and a half , three members of el-Jahmi 's family -- eldest son [PER Muhammad  ] , daughter [PER Lamia  ] and daughter [PER Hana  ] -- appeared . 
[PER Muhammad  ] el-Jahmi , clearly unhappy that an [MISC Emboff  ] was present , declined to speak with P/E Chief . 
No member of el-Jahmi 's family had been able to visit him since April 3 , the last day P/E Chief visited him . 
The last information the el-Jahmi family had received about their father 's medical condition came in a telephone conversation with a man identified as el-Jahmi 's nurse , [PER Abdullah Bashir  ] , more than three weeks ago . 
EL-JAHMI'S FAMILY UNDER PRESSURE & [ORG THREATENED  ] 5 . 
( C ) xxxxxxxxxxxx said , [PER Muhammad  ] , was under " tremendous pressure " from officials of the [ORG GOL  ] and [ORG QDF  ] and believed contact with [MISC Emboffs  ] was " very dangerous " for the family . 
Explaining [PER Muhammad  ] 's refusal to speak with P/E Chief , xxxxxxxxxxxx said he had been working for several weeks to orchestrate a visit to their father , and had been anxious to avoid giving the appearance that the family 's request was coordinated with the Embassy . 
After weeks of waiting , the family had been hastily summoned a short time earlier that day to the [ORG TMC.  ] xxxxxxxxxxxx said el-Jahmi family members in [LOC Benghazi  ] and [LOC Tripoli  ] are under continuous , close observation by security officials , and are " very afraid " . 
Asked whether the family had received any threats , xxxxxxxxxxxx declined to say anything further . 
About five minutes after their arrival , [PER Muhammad  ] summoned his two sisters and they left the wing without having seen their father . 
6 . 
( C ) Shortly after el-Jahmi 's family departed , the senior security official told P/E Chief it would be better if he returned on another day to visit el-Jahmi . 
Emphasizing that he was not preventing access to el-Jahmi , he said he had just spoken with the man described as el-Jahmi 's nurse , [PER Abdullah Bashir  ] , who indicated that the diagnostic procedures would take at least another hour , and that el-Jahmi would be too tired after they were completed to meet with P/E Chief . 
( Note: P/E Chief had attempted to call [PER Bashir  ] before el-Jahmi 's family [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000401 002 OF 002 arrived ; [PER Bashir  ] did not take the calls . 
End note . 
) The security official pressed P/E Chief hard to specify the date and time he intended to return to visit el-Jahmi ; he declined to do so . 
7 . 
( C ) Comment: We strongly suspect the " coincidence " of [MISC P/E  ] Chief 's visit and that of el-Jahmi 's family members was coordinated . 
While the [ORG QDF  ] has insisted since May 8 on the fiction that el-Jahmi has been in his family 's custody and not/not that of the [ORG GOL  ] , it is not clear what the [ORG QDF  ] and/or [ORG GOL  ] hoped to gain by dissembling about the fact that el-Jahmi had been discharged from hospital and returned to his family home in [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
From our perspective , the [ORG QDF  ] was either misinformed by elements of the [ORG GOL  ] or , more likely , was a witting participant in the effort to deceive us about el-Jahmi 's whereabouts . 
Either way , until his family saw him on May 14 , el-Jahmi had effectively been in incommunicado detention for 41 days . 
His present medical condition is uncertain .
