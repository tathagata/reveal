2004 THE HAGUE 3156 ( NOT ALL ) Classified By: [PER Richard Huff  ] , Econ Counselor , for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . 
1 ( [LOC S  ] ) Over the last two years , [ORG Defense  ] and State export control officials have been working with the [ORG GONL  ] towards agreement on rules governing sales of 14-bit analogue to digital converters ( [MISC ADCs  ] ) to [MISC Chinese  ] companies . 
Most recently , on 14 November , 2004 State NP/ECNP and DOD officers briefed [ORG Dutch Ministry of Defense  ] ( [ORG MOD  ] ) , [ORG Economic Affairs  ] ( [ORG MEA  ] ) and [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] export control staff on [MISC Chinese  ] end-users ( ref A ) . 
At that meeting the [MISC Dutch  ] said [ORG Philips Electronics  ] had pending sales of 14-bit [MISC ADCs  ] to [MISC Chinese  ] companies . 
The [ORG GONL  ] favored a parts control program to govern these sales , and promised to share their plan with us as soon as it was ready ( ref B ) . <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) On February 11 , 2005 , [ORG MOD  ] officials provided post 's Office of [ORG Defense Cooperation  ] with a letter from [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG MOD  ] Armaments Director [PER RADM Dirk van Dord  ] to Acting U/S [PER Michael Wynne  ] and Deputy U/S [PER Lisa Bronson  ] ( para three ) , an advance copy of the [MISC Dutch  ] parts control plan ( para four ) and an annex to the plan ( para five ) . 
[ORG MEA  ] officials told us [MISC Dutch  ] State Secretary for Trade Karien van [PER Gennip  ] will provide the [MISC USG SIPDIS  ] with an official copy of the plan and annex , probably in March . 
[ORG ODC  ] has forwarded the letters to their principals . 
Text of the letter , plan and annex follow. ----------------------------------------- COVER LETTER TO U/S WYNNE AND U/S BRONSON ----------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Begin text of letter: The [LOC Hague  ] , 11 February 2005 The last two years we discussed the subject of the 14-bit [ORG Analogue Digital Converters  ] ( [MISC ADCs  ] ) , the potential export of [MISC ADCs  ] by [ORG Philips  ] to the People 's [LOC Republic of China  ] ( [LOC PRC  ] ) , in several bilateral meetings . 
After having evaluated all the relevant aspects , the [ORG Ministry of Economic Affairs  ] will inform the [LOC United States  ] government about the position of the [MISC Dutch  ] government . 
The purpose of this letter is to inform you about this letter and to provide background information on the decision . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] government will apply strict export conditions to the supply of high speed 14-bit analogue-to-digital converters ( [MISC ADCs  ] ) to [MISC Chinese  ] manufacturers of telecommunication equipment . 
The conditions have been accepted by [ORG Philips Electronics  ] ( see annex ) . 
The decision to apply these specific conditions was taken after due consideration of all relevant aspects presented in several [LOC US  ] non-papers , the bilateral meetings as well as the identical letters sent by the Deputy [PER Secretaries Kassinger  ] , [ORG Armitage  ] and [PER Wolfowitz  ] in August 2004 to State Secretary [PER Van Gennip  ] , Minister Bot and State Secretary [PER Van der Knaap  ] respectively . 
You will notice that the conditions laid down in the parts control plan bare a close resemblance to the license conditions agreed on by the ( [LOC US  ] ) [ORG Advisory Committee  ] on [ORG Export Policy  ] with regard to an application , more than a year ago , by ( a ) [LOC US  ] exporter ( s ) of 14-bit [MISC ADCs  ] to [MISC Chinese  ] entities and in that sense constitute the sought after level of harmonization of conditions as set by the export control authorities in both our countries . 
You may also notice that the [LOC Netherlands  ] export control authorities have not in advance limited the applicability of these conditions to any particular [MISC Chinese  ] manufacturers of telecommunication equipment or for example excluded certain such manufacturers by virtue of stock ownership ( i.e. no distinction between wholly and non-wholly owned [LOC PRC  ] companies ) . 
Specifically included within the scope of these conditions are contracts with manufacturers based outside [LOC China  ] but with ( known intended use of ) production facilities in [LOC China  ] . 
By thus expanding rather than limiting the scope of harmonized conditions , unwarranted distortion of the [MISC Chinese  ] market for telecommunication equipment incorporating high speed 14-bit [MISC ADCs  ] is avoided . 
As long as the production of these 14-bit [MISC ADCs  ] is limited to companies based in either the [LOC US  ] or the [LOC Netherlands  ] all such [MISC ADCs  ] entering the [MISC Chinese  ] market as bulk supply of parts will in fact be covered by a similar parts control plan . 
To conclude , I assure you that this issue has kept my personal attention all the time . 
Please be aware that to ensure that all the defense interests would be addressed , the final parts control plan was formulated in close co-operation with my staff . 
If you need any clarification , please do not hesitate to contact me personally .

( [ORG S  ] ) Begin text of Parts Control Plan: SECRET - RELEASABLE TO THE [LOC UNITED STATES  ] OF AMERICA SIPDIS NETHERLANDS' APPROACH TO DELIVERIES OF [MISC ADCs  ] TO [MISC CHINESE  ] ENTITIES Conditions set by the [LOC Netherlands  ] export control authorities and agreed to by [ORG Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V  ] . 
( [ORG Philips  ] ) to the supply ( supply is understood to mean the actual delivery of [MISC ADCs  ] to production facilities where these [MISC ADCs  ] are processed into telecommunication equipment or into assembled parts of such equipment , irrespective of the question whether the [MISC ADCs  ] are sold directly to the manufacturers involved or through intermediates . 
) of high speed 14-bit analogue to digital converters ( hereafter: 14-bit [MISC ADCs  ] ) to manufacturers of telecommunications equipment in the People 's [LOC Republic of China  ] ( hereafter: [MISC Chinese  ] manufacturers ) . 
Before signing a contract for the supply of 14-bit [MISC ADCs  ] to any [MISC Chinese  ] manufacturer [ORG Philips  ] will establish that the relevant contract , be it with a [MISC Chinese  ] manufacturer or an intermediate , contains clauses to effectively assure that: <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1. all 14-bit [MISC ADCs  ] that are to be supplied under this contract will solely be used for the manufacture of base stations or parts thereof for civilian communication purposes ; <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2. telecommunication equipment or assembled parts of such equipment containing these 14-bit [MISC ADCs  ] can only be sold to telecommunications operators or any other third party after receipt of an end-use statement by such a third party declaring that the equipment or assembled parts will solely be used for civilian communication purposes ; <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3. the supply of these 14-bit [MISC ADCs  ] will occur according to an agreed parts control plan with the features described in the delivery procedure in [ORG Annex  ] 1 ; <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4. the person ( s ) who will be responsible for the proper implementation of the parts control plan and its delivery procedure is ( are ) identified by name and function ; <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5. all parties concerned agree - or will have agreed in advance of any supply to them - to provide [ORG Philips  ] with all information required to enable [ORG Philips  ] to report on the implementation of the parts control plan to the [LOC Netherlands  ] export control authorities ; <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6. no objections exist or will be raised against audits to be performed by or on behalf of the [LOC Netherlands  ] Government on the implementation of the parts control plan at the manufacturers site . 
Prior to the first regular supply of 14-bit [MISC ADCs  ] to any [MISC Chinese  ] manufacturer of telecommunications equipment or parts thereof , [ORG Philips  ] will be allowed , under the conditions described above , to supply a set of samples in a quantity - yet to be decided - that will not exceed the number appropriate for testing and prototype manufacturing purposes . 
Should [ORG Philips  ] be asked to supply 14-bit [MISC ADCs  ] to a manufacturer outside [LOC China  ] , but with ( the use of ) production facilities in [LOC China  ] , then the relevant contract must stipulate that all the clauses mentioned above as well as the delivery procedure described in [ORG Annex  ] 1 will apply in full to any shipments of 14-bit [MISC ADCs  ] to such production facilities in [LOC China  ] .

( [ORG S  ] ) Begin text of [ORG Annex.  ] ------- [ORG ANNEX  ] 1 ------- [ORG Annex  ] 1 - [ORG Delivery Procedure Physical  ] deliveries will be made to manufacturers , not to intermediates . 
Invoicing , however , can be done as required . 
[ORG Philips  ] will register the date , the amount of [MISC ADCs  ] involved and the particular recipient of every relevant shipment . 
Each recipient will register the date and the amount of [MISC ADCs  ] involved of every shipment received with a reference to the supplier 's order/delivery number . 
Since the total stock at [MISC Chinese  ] manufacturers production sites may not exceed the amount of [MISC ADCs  ] necessary for two weeks production the [MISC Chinese  ] manufacturer will provide [ORG Philips  ] either directly or trough any intermediate supplier with the following documentation for each production site: - A detailed production schedule for the period of three weeks starting the day the order is placed and specifying the exact quantity of 14-bit [MISC ADCs  ] need to complete that production plan ; - The exact quantity of 14-bit [MISC ADCs  ] on stock at the moment of ordering ; - A declaration containing the exact quantity of 14-bit [MISC ADCs  ] destroyed because of malfunctioning of PCB 's or base stations and a precise description of the manner in which these [MISC ADCs  ] were destroyed . 
This declaration must cover the period between the date of the previous order and the date of the new order and it must be signed by the quality control manager of the production site in question . 
The volume of any follow on supply will be adjusted if a report by the [MISC Chinese  ] manufacturer shows a significant deviation from the anticipated volume for two weeks production . 
[ORG Philips  ] will archive all information on the implementation of the parts control plans and will make this information available for scrutiny by the [LOC Netherlands  ] export control authorities upon request . 
[ORG Philips  ] will provide the [LOC Netherlands  ] export control authorities with a quarterly summary report on the functioning of the parts control plans as well as on the quantity of [MISC ADCs  ] supplied to [MISC Chinese  ] manufacturers under those parts control plans . 
[ORG Philips  ] will inform the [LOC Netherlands  ] export control authorities forthwith of any irregularities it notices in the figures or in case it has reason to believe that any [MISC Chinese  ] manufacturer or intermediate involved in the parts control plans is not compliant with these conditions .
