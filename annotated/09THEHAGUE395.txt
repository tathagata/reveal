Gallagher  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . 
Mr. President: <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Your July 14 meeting with [MISC Dutch  ] Prime Minister [PER Jan Pieter Balkenende  ] provides an opportunity for us to urge the [MISC Dutch  ] to continue as part of [ORG NATO  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and to enlist PM [PER Balkenende  ] in solving [ORG Guantanamo  ] issues . 
For his part , [PER Balkenende  ] will seek to continue the [MISC Dutch  ] role in the [LOC G20  ] and to find a common ground to work with us on climate change and the [LOC Middle East.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Balkenende  ] , in office through four coalitions since 2002 , is a cunning politician who does not impose his vision on coalition partners , but maneuvers effectively to achieve the intended goal . 
At first , he was dismissed as a lightweight " " [PER Harry Potter  ] " " look-alike , but he has consistently and skillfully delivered Cabinet support for [LOC U.S.  ] policy objectives while balancing fragile parliamentary majorities . 
[PER Balkenende  ] , s current center-left coalition government ( " " [PER Balkenende  ] IV " " ) is held together more by fear of early elections than any unity of vision . 
The financial crisis has plunged the [LOC Netherlands  ] into a recession likely to last through 2010 , and the Cabinet must continually defend its three relatively modest stimulus packages against calls to do more to spur recovery . 
[PER Balkenende  ] is also under pressure from a skeptical public to withdraw the [LOC Netherlands  ] , 1,800 troops from [LOC Afghanistan  ] in 2010 . 
His main coalition partner , the [ORG Labor Party  ] , is in decline , having fared poorly in the 2006 national election and the 2009 [MISC European  ] Parliament election , and believes rejecting a continuing role in [LOC Afghanistan  ] will please its base and may win back supporters. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) The [PER Wilders  ] Factor: Golden-pompadoured , maverick parliamentarian [PER Geert Wilders  ] , anti-Islam , nationalist [ORG Freedom Party  ] remains a thorn in the coalition , s side , capitalizing on the social stresses resulting from the failure to fully integrate almost a million [MISC Dutch  ] Muslims , mostly of [MISC Moroccan  ] or [MISC Turkish  ] descent . 
In existence only since 2006 , the [ORG Freedom Party  ] , tightly controlled by [PER Wilders  ] , has grown to be the [LOC Netherlands  ] second largest , and fastest growing , party . 
Recent polls suggest it could even replace [PER Balkenende  ] , s [MISC Christian Democrats  ] as the top party in 2011 parliamentary elections . 
[PER Wilders  ] is no friend of the [MISC U.S.:  ] he opposes [MISC Dutch  ] military involvement in [LOC Afghanistan  ] ; he believes development assistance is money wasted ; he opposes [ORG NATO  ] missions outside " " allied " " territory ; he is against most [ORG EU  ] initiatives ; and , most troubling , he forments fear and hatred of immigrants. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) As a result of these currents , [PER Balkenende  ] , s coalition finds itself in a precarious position and could fall within a year ( most likely after municipal elections in March 2010 ) . 
The Prime Minister is aware we want him to deliver continued [MISC Dutch  ] boots on the ground in [LOC Afghanistan  ] after 2010 and help with [ORG Guantanamo  ] detainees . 
He knows there are high risks/expectations involved in his meeting with you , but we understand he is coming to offer as much as he thinks he can deliver at this time. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) [PER Balkenende  ] , a long-time champion of [MISC U.S.-Dutch  ] relations , seeks to establish a strong relationship with you and capitalize on your popularity . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] public overwhelmingly supported your election in November , and you remain hugely popular here as a beacon of change . 
[PER Balkenende  ] Qremain hugely popular here as a beacon of change . 
[PER Balkenende  ] will encourage you to view the long arc of the [MISC U.S.-Dutch  ] relationship , not just current bumps in the road ( e.g. the likely drawdown of [MISC Dutch  ] forces in [LOC Afghanistan  ] after 2010 ) . 
He wants you to see the [LOC Netherlands  ] as [LOC America  ] , s friend and partner , with significant [MISC Dutch  ] contributions to our shared foreign policy priorities: [MISC Dutch  ] military presence in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and support for [ORG NATO  ] ; support for [LOC U.S.  ] intervention in [LOC Iraq  ] ; active participation in the [ORG EU  ] , [ORG NATO  ] , and other multilateral institutions ; substantial and sustained foreign development assistance ; and a long-standing commitment to promoting human rights , tolerance , and the rule of law . 
And , he will ask you for a seat at the [MISC G-20  ] table in [LOC Pittsburgh  ] as well as for a meeting at the [LOC White House  ] in September for the [ORG Crown Prince.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Balkenende  ] will use your private , one-on-one session to highlight your shared personal values and experiences . 
He believes social organizations are more effective in promoting change than government . 
His philosophy is that we must treat THE HAGUE 00000395 002 OF 002 one another with dignity and respect as we live and work together . 
Your Father , s Day call for fathers to accept more responsibility in the rearing of their children resonated with him . 
[PER Balkenende  ] will also likely use the one-on-one session to pinpoint the political difficulties of the deliverables we are seeking . 
Rather than cover a laundry list of topics , the [MISC Dutch  ] want the larger meeting to focus on 1 ) Afghanistan/Pakistan , 2 ) the future of the global economic system ( including the role of the [LOC G20  ] and how to help developing countries ) , 3 ) the [LOC Middle East Peace  ] Process/Iran , and 4 ) climate change . 
The Prime Minister is anticipating other key foreign policy issues ( e.g. human rights , [LOC Russia  ] , [ORG NATO  ] , non-proliferation , energy security , 400th anniversary of [PER Henry Hudson  ] , s voyage to [LOC Manhattan  ] - NY400 ) can be covered by staff or only briefly mentioned to stay focused on the major issues . 
Two cables will follow which will expand on these topics .
