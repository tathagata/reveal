2008 [LOC BERLIN  ] 504 Classified By: [PER Robert A. Pollard  ] , Minister-Counselor for [MISC Economic Affai  ] rs for Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: [LOC Germany  ] 's new federal interior minister , [PER Thomas de Maiziere  ] , is known for being a competent administrator who performed effectively over the past four years as the Chancellery Chief of Staff . 
De [PER Maiziere  ] is a close confidant of Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] , their professional relationship dates back to 1990 , and he developed a reputation as a reliable crisis manager and interagency master over the past four years . 
Although de [PER Maiziere  ] previously served as a state interior minister in [LOC Saxony  ] , he has less direct experience dealing with the international security issues - most prominently counterterrorism - that he will face as federal interior minister . 
Furthermore , de [PER Maiziere  ] is not known for being ideological or outspoken . 
In this respect , de [PER Maiziere  ] represents a marked change from his predecessor , powerhouse [PER Wolfgang Schaeuble  ] , who had strong views on security policy and was willing to endure considerable criticism to achieve his policy goals . 
We do not expect de [PER Maiziere  ] to push for further expanding law enforcement powers of police and/or security services . 
De [PER Maiziere  ] indicates that he intends to focus on integration of foreigners into [MISC German  ] society and will continue the [ORG Ministry 's Islam Conference  ] , a controversial [PER Schaeuble  ] initiative that had advanced the country 's discussion on immigration and discrimination issues . 
He also intends to promote the further integration of former east and west [LOC Germany  ] . 
END SUMMARY An Aristocratic Westerner Makes His Name in the [LOC East ---------------------------------------------  ] ------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) De [PER Maiziere  ] , 55 , is a lawyer by training who was born and raised in [LOC Bonn  ] , but has spent nearly the last two decades in the eastern states of [LOC Mecklenburg-Vorpommern  ] and [LOC Saxony  ] . 
He is a descendent of the noble [MISC Maiziere-les-Metz  ] family who , as Huguenots , fled [LOC France  ] for asylum in [LOC Prussia  ] in the late seventeenth century . 
De [PER Maiziere  ] 's father , [PER Ulrich  ] , was [ORG Inspector General of the German Armed Forces  ] . 
His cousin , [PER Lothar  ] , was the last , and only democratically elected , Premier of the [MISC German  ] [LOC Democratic Republic  ] , who later served as a minister in the [LOC Kohl  ] government . 
As a staffer in the offices of [LOC Berlin  ] Governing Mayor [PER Richard von Weizsacker  ] , and later [PER Eberhard Diepgen  ] , de [PER Maiziere  ] participated in the negotiations on [MISC German  ] reunification . 
After 1990 , de [PER Maiziere  ] worked to re-establish democratic structures in eastern states starting first in [LOC Mecklenburg-Vorpommern  ] . 
From 1998 through 2005 , de [PER Maiziere  ] served in [LOC Saxony  ] as head of the State Chancery , and as Finance , [ORG Justice  ] and Interior Minister . 
De [PER Maiziere  ] joined the [ORG Christian Democratic Union  ] ( [ORG CDU  ] ) as a student in 1972 . 
De [PER Maiziere  ] won a direct mandate in the September 27 national parliamentary election and is now a member of the [ORG Bundestag  ] representing the district of [LOC Meissen  ] in [LOC Saxony.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) De [PER Maiziere  ] first met [PER Angela Merkel  ] in 1990 and his recommendation of her to his cousin [PER Lothar  ] de [PER Maiziere  ] is said to have facilitated her entry into [ORG CDU  ] politics . 
Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] and de [PER Maiziere  ] are known to have a very close professional relationship and to share a similar sober and analytical approach to governing . 
De [PER Maiziere  ] is reported to have performed well throughout his tenure as [PER Merkel  ] 's Chancellery Chief and Minister for Special Duties . 
As Chancellery Chief of Staff , de [PER Maiziere  ] was known as a consensus builder who understands and effectively works the interagency process , sometimes requiring competing ministers to resolve disputes among themselves . 
The Chancellor no doubt appreciated de [PER Maiziere  ] 's efforts to shield her from these policy battles given her general propensity to stay above the fray and to express an opinion on an issue only when consensus has been reached at the cabinet level . 
De [PER Maiziere  ] Faces a Steep Learning Curve ---------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) De [PER Maiziere  ] 's experience in eastern [LOC Germany  ] helped him gain new responsibilities for the [ORG Federal Interior Ministry:  ] the entire [ORG Department of Eastern German  ] affairs has been moved from the [ORG Transportation and Urban Affairs Ministry  ] to the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] . 
In his remarks to ministry employees on his first day in office , de [PER Maiziere  ] said that with this move the interior ministry is now responsible for not only immigrant integration , but also the integration of [MISC Eastern  ] and [LOC Western Germany  ] and the cohesion of [MISC German  ] society . 
De [PER Maiziere  ] will continue the [MISC German  ] [ORG Islam Conference  ] , an initiative started by his predecessor , which seeks to improve the integration of [LOC Germany  ] 's [MISC Muslim  ] population and open a dialogue between the government and [LOC Germany  ] 's [MISC Muslim  ] community . 
The [ORG Islam Conference  ] has met with some controversy and came under scrutiny earlier this year when it was discovered that some [MISC Muslim  ] representatives were alleged to have links with extremist groups. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S/NF ) De [PER Maiziere  ] has some familiarity with security issues given that his duties in the Chancellery included overall coordination of [LOC Germany  ] 's intelligence services . 
De [PER Maiziere  ] was helpful in promoting cooperation between [MISC German  ] ministries and security services with [ORG USG  ] counterparts both during the 2007 [MISC Sauerland Islamic Jihad Union  ] terrorist cell case and following extremist threats surrounding the recent national elections . 
De [PER Maiziere  ] 's predecessor [PER Wolfgang Schaeuble  ] spent considerable time dealing with the issue of terrorism and working to update [LOC Germany  ] 's legal frameworks and expand the mandates of law enforcement agencies to ensure they had the capabilities to address the phenomena . 
In contrast , de [PER Maiziere  ] said virtually nothing in public on the issue of terrorism during his time in the [LOC Chancellery  ] , and he has not emphasized the topic since moving to [ORG Interior  ] . 
Therefore , there is some question concerning the depth of his knowledge of the transnational character of terrorism , radicalization pathways , and terrorists' increasing use of the [MISC Internet  ] and related technology to recruit , train and organize , aspects of the issue that most affect [LOC Germany  ] today. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) During his first day remarks to employees , de [PER Maiziere  ] made the peculiar statement that " the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] is responsible for internal matters , and the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] is responsible for issues external to [LOC Germany  ] . 
" This characterization of the [ORG MoI  ] 's tasks contrasts sharply with [ORG EU  ] law enforcement integration initiatives under [PER Schaeuble  ] such as the [MISC Pruem  ] data sharing agreement . 
Observers are concerned that de [PER Maiziere  ] 's limited perspective could result in diminished bilateral cooperation and mark a significant departure from former minister [PER Schaeuble  ] , who placed a heavy emphasis throughout his tenure on increasing security cooperation with [MISC European  ] and other international partners . 
De [PER Maiziere  ] would benefit from learning about the benefits of international cooperation first hand from his counterparts at the [MISC G6  ] meeting in [LOC London  ] this week , which DHS Secretary [PER Napolitano  ] and senior DoJ representatives will attend . 
( [MISC Note:  ] The [MISC G6  ] is an informal grouping of the interior ministers of [LOC Germany  ] , [LOC Italy  ] , [LOC Spain  ] , [LOC France  ] , [LOC Poland  ] and the [LOC UK  ] . 
[PER Schaeuble  ] made a point of inviting the [ORG USG  ] to [MISC G6  ] meetings that he hosted , a custom that [LOC UK  ] Minister [PER Jacqui Smith  ] is following for this week 's [LOC London  ] meeting . 
Ref D . 
) Will de [PER Maiziere  ] be a [ORG Strong Security Partner  ] ? --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) We do not expect de [PER Maiziere  ] to be aggressive in pushing for expanded security powers . 
However , there is less need for this as two recent legislative packages have already strengthened [LOC Germany  ] 's counterterrorism legal framework ( Refs C and E ) . 
More relevant is whether de [PER Maiziere  ] will build on [PER Schaeuble  ] 's record of deepening [MISC U.S.-German  ] security cooperation , such as the successful negotiations of a bilateral " [MISC Pruem-like  ] " agreement to exchange information on terrorism and serious crime suspects , as well as establish an automated fingerprint checking system . 
Final implementation of our agreement is awaiting resolution of some concerns raised by a [ORG Green Party Justice Senator  ] from [LOC Hamburg  ] . 
We will likely need support from de [PER Maiziere  ] to break this impasse , but it is unclear whether de [PER Maiziere  ] is willing to make the effort on an initiative that his predecessor initiated and for which he received heavy criticism due to data privacy concerns . 
On the issue of resettlement of [LOC Guantanamo  ] detainees , de [PER Maiziere  ] has yet to express a viewpoint one way or the other. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) We anticipate that data protection and domestic security issues will be a continuing theme that the new coalition government of the [MISC Christian Democrats  ] ( [ORG CDU  ] and [ORG CSU  ] ) and [MISC Free Democrats  ] ( [ORG FDP  ] ) will struggle with . 
During the previous administration , the [ORG FDP  ] regularly criticized former interior minister [PER Schaeuble  ] for policies which the [ORG FDP  ] believed trampled on citizens' privacy rights ( Ref B ) . 
[LOC Germany  ] 's new Justice Minister [PER Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger  ] ( [ORG FDP  ] ) believes that [PER Schaeuble  ] went too far in giving police new powers of investigation , and she was successful in committing the new government to modify a number of these powers and introducing added data protection measures in the recently completed coalition agreement ( Ref A ) . 
The [ORG FDP  ] has found it politically expedient to cast personal freedoms and security policy as mutually exclusive . 
In this debate , de [PER Maiziere  ] 's greatest advantage is that he is not [PER Schaeuble  ] . 
As Interior Minister , de [PER Maiziere  ] is expected to support existing laws and practices initiated by his predecessor , and his reputation for reasonableness and consensus-building should serve him well in these discussions .
