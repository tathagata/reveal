REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] ( [ORG QDF  ] ) Executive Director [PER Yussef Sawani  ] informed the [ORG CDA  ] on May 8 that [MISC Libyan  ] human rights activist and regime critic [PER Fathi  ] el-Jahmi had been discharged from the [ORG Tripoli Medical Center  ] ( [ORG TMC  ] ) and has returned to his home , where he is currently in the care of his family . 
Saying the [ORG QDF  ] had " no objection " to the [ORG Embassy  ] reaching out to el-Jahmi 's family , he cautioned that one of el-Jahmi 's sons had asked the [ORG QDF  ] to convey to the [ORG Embassy  ] that the family does not wish to be contacted or visited by [ORG Embassy  ] officers , out of concern that such contact could " create problems . 
" [PER Sawani  ] claimed that el-Jahmi 's return to his home demonstrated that he had been " a free man " since his hospitalization at [ORG Tripoli Medical Center  ] in summer 2007 . 
2 . 
( C ) Comment: Given the family 's alleged desire not to be contacted by the [ORG Embassy  ] , [ORG Post  ] recommends Department seek confirmation of the report of el-Jahmi 's release from his [MISC U.S.-based  ] brother , [PER Muhammad  ] el-Jahmi . 
[PER Sawani  ] did not indicate which family home el-Jahmi had returned to ( the family maintains residences in [LOC Tripoli  ] and [LOC Benghazi  ] ) , nor did he indicate whether there were any conditions attached to el-Jahmi 's discharge from the [ORG TMC  ] . 
Other questions include whether arrangements for needed outpatient medical care have been made and whether the family in fact requested that the [ORG Embassy  ] not contact them . 
End comment .
