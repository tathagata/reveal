Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) If the [LOC United States  ] wants to make a difference on [LOC Burma  ] , it should engage directly with General [PER Than Shwe  ] , Assistant Foreign Minister [PER Cui Tiankai  ] told [ORG EAP  ] DAS [PER Eric John  ] on March 5 . 
In a separate meeting , MFA Director General for [ORG Asian Affairs Hu  ] Zhengyue stressed that State Councilor [PER Tang  ] " really worked on " the [MISC Burmese  ] during his recent visit to [LOC Burma  ] , delivering the message that [LOC Burma  ] needs to respond to the concerns of the international community . 
[ORG DAS John  ] underlined that the [LOC United States  ] is worried that [LOC Burma  ] is headed at high speed in the wrong direction .

[ORG EAP  ] DAS [PER Thomas Christensen  ] joined [ORG DAS  ] [PER John  ] at the meetings . 
End Summary . 
Burma: United [ORG States-China Cooperation Vital  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) DAS [PER John  ] told [ORG AFM  ] [PER Cui  ] that while the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC China  ] agree that [LOC Burma  ] is a problem , we differ on what venue and tools we should use to resolve it . 
We want to find a creative way forward that produces tangible results . 
The [LOC United States  ] and [LOC China  ] concur on the message we need to send [LOC Burma  ] 's generals ; that is , that they should accept [ORG UN  ] engagement , release political prisoners , permit NGOs to operate in-country and settle differences peacefully with ethnic minorities . 
To advance the process , the [LOC United States  ] would like to work in parallel with [LOC China.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) [ORG AFM  ] [PER Cui  ] responded that if the [LOC United States  ] wants to make a difference on [LOC Burma  ] , it should engage directly with General [PER Than Shwe  ] . 
For [LOC China  ] , the situation in [LOC Burma  ] is a question of national security . 
[LOC China  ] and [LOC Burma  ] share a long border and considerable historical and cultural ties . 
In this context , [LOC China  ] is very concerned about the potential for unrest or political change in [LOC Burma  ] . 
Over the past half-century , [LOC Beijing  ] and [LOC Rangoon  ] have enjoyed good relations and [LOC China  ] has never interfered in its neighbor 's internal affairs . 
The Government can solve its own problems , [ORG AFM  ] [PER Cui  ] judged . 
Nonetheless , [LOC China  ] is aware that fighting between Government forces and ethnic minorities has been a constant over the years . 
While the Government has reached a settlement with 17 of the 18 ethnic groups , it should continue to work toward national reconciliation . 
Many of the minorities live in border areas , [ORG AFM  ] [PER Cui  ] observed , adding that such conflicts risk harming [LOC China  ] 's own security . 
[ORG AFM  ] Cui: Why [LOC China  ] Vetoed ------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) [ORG AFM  ] [PER Cui  ] contended that [LOC China  ] is doing its part on [LOC Burma  ] . 
He related that during State Councilor [PER Tang Jiaxuan  ] 's February 25-27 visit to the country ( reftel ) , [PER Tang  ] met with [PER Than Shwe  ] and other top generals . 
[PER Tang  ] conveyed a " very clear " message to the leadership , specifically that 1 ) it should speed up the political reform and reconciliation process and 2 ) it should respond more constructively to the concerns of the international community . 
At the same time , [LOC China  ] is encouraging [ORG ASEAN  ] to exert positive pressure and to continue to cooperate with the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC China  ] to bring about " the kinds of changes in [LOC Burma  ] we all want to see . 
" The [MISC Burmese  ] people are known for their patience , [ORG AFM  ] [PER Cui  ] maintained , so we must take a long-term approach . 
Applying too much pressure on the leadership will likely produce more resistance to outside appeals . 
However we proceed , our main objective should be to maintain stability . 
Governance in [LOC Burma  ] may be bad , but a situation where there is no governance would be much worse , [ORG AFM  ] [PER Cui  ] said. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) Such concerns about stability prompted [LOC China  ] to veto the [ORG UN Security Council  ] resolution on [LOC Burma  ] in January , [ORG AFM  ] [PER Cui  ] remarked . 
[LOC China  ] believes passing the resolution would [LOC BEIJING  ] 00001448 002.2 OF 004 have been counterproductive , although " we understand the [ORG United States'  ] interests " in the matter . 
Despite the veto at the [ORG UN  ] , [LOC China  ] wants to enhance its cooperation and coordination with the [LOC United States  ] on [LOC Burma  ] issues . 
Confrontation between [LOC Washington  ] and [LOC Beijing  ] serves no one 's interests . 
As part of this , [LOC China  ] favors the idea of the [LOC United States  ] opening some form of communication with General [PER Than Shwe  ] . 
" We will see what we can do , " [ORG AFM  ] [PER Cui  ] said , adding that such a dialogue could help the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC China  ] avoid future disputes at the [ORG UN  ] . 
In [LOC China  ] 's view , international mechanisms other than the [ORG Security Council  ] are the proper venues for dealing with problems [LOC Burma  ] faces regarding human rights , drugs and other issues . 
[ORG ASEAN  ] 's Role on [LOC Burma  ] --------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) [ORG AFM  ] [PER Cui  ] said [ORG ASEAN  ] is growing " frustrated " with [LOC Burma  ] . 
After [MISC Malaysian  ] Foreign Minister [PER Syed Hamid  ] 's poor treatment during his 2006 visit to the country , [ORG ASEAN  ] lost its appetite to pursue new efforts . 
Nonetheless , [LOC China  ] continues to encourage [ORG ASEAN  ] to do more and to coordinate its efforts with those of [LOC China  ] and the [LOC United States  ] . 
Meanwhile , [LOC China  ] hopes [ORG UN  ] SYG [PER Ban Ki-moon  ] will name a new Special Envoy. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) DAS [PER John  ] underscored the importance of [ORG ASEAN  ] 's reaching out to the [MISC Burmese  ] regime , especially as a way to counter the generals' paranoid belief that the [ORG United States'  ] is actively seeking to overthrow the regime . 
While agreeing that taking a long-term view of [LOC Burma  ] issues is useful , [PER DAS John  ] emphasized that lack of good governance has been a persistent problem for the country . 
In this context , he cautioned that the [MISC Burmese  ] leadership 's adoption of a new constitution that serves to lock out certain parties from political participation would be a step backward and could harm [ORG United States-China  ] cooperation . 
[PER DAS Christensen  ] reaffirmed these views , adding that [LOC Burma  ] 's making the wrong decision on the constitution could result in antagonism between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC China  ] in the [ORG Security Council  ] . 
He stressed that the [LOC United States  ] wants cooperation with [LOC China  ] on [LOC Burma.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) [ORG AFM  ] [PER Cui  ] expressed confidence that positive change will come to [LOC Burma  ] , but it will take time . 
He predicted that the change would be in line with the overall trend in [LOC Southeast Asia  ] , that is , that a number of nations in the region have moved away from military rule toward a more open system , including [LOC Indonesia  ] , [LOC Thailand  ] and the [LOC Philippines  ] . 
[LOC Indonesia  ] 's President Yudhonoyo is no longer a general , [ORG AFM  ] [PER Cui  ] stressed . 
[LOC Thailand  ] 's current military leadership will not remain in power over the long haul . 
While there are persistent rumors about military coups in the [LOC Philippines  ] , they rarely happen. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) [ORG AFM  ] [PER Cui  ] acknowledged that the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC China  ] should " take action before things get worse . 
" [LOC China  ] 's role as facilitator of the [MISC Six-Party Talks  ] on [LOC North Korea  ] could serve as a model for bringing about an exchange between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Burma  ] . 
As for next steps , [ORG AFM  ] [PER Cui  ] and [PER DAS John  ] agreed that Embassy [LOC Beijing  ] and [ORG MFA Asia Division  ] officials would remain in contact on the matter . 
[ORG DG  ] Hu: [LOC Burma  ] Likely Open to Dialogue ------------------------------------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) In an earlier meeting with [ORG MFA DG for Asian Affairs Hu Zhengyue  ] , [PER DAS John  ] stressed our concerns over [LOC Burma  ] 's [ORG National Convention  ] process producing a constitution that excludes groups from participating in the country 's political life . 
Such a step could hamper the ability of the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC China  ] to cooperate and could cause quarrels between us over [LOC Burma  ] at the [ORG United Nations  ] . 
Noting that [LOC China  ] has been in contact with the [LOC Burma  ] 's [ORG SPDC  ] leadership , [PER DAS John  ] asked [ORG DG Hu  ] for his views on how to stop [LOC Burma  ] from moving at high speed in the wrong direction. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S ) [ORG DG Hu  ] said that in his personal view , a [ORG United States-Burma  ] dialogue would be productive and that [LOC Burma  ] would likely be open to conducting such a dialogue , with [MISC Chinese  ] facilitation . 
There are misunderstandings between the [LOC United States  ] and [MISC Burmese  ] sides , [ORG DG Hu  ] said , adding that opening the door to direct communication is the best way to achieve positive results . 
[PER DAS John  ] noted that the [LOC United States  ] has an Embassy in [LOC Rangoon  ] but that the [MISC Burmese  ] to date have appeared uninterested in talking with us . 
[LOC Washington  ] , [LOC BEIJING  ] 00001448 003.2 OF 004 however , remains committed to finding a diplomatic solution to the problems in [LOC Burma  ] . 
[ORG DG Hu  ] promised to look into the matter and respond soon . 
[ORG DG Hu  ] on State Councilor [PER Tang  ] 's [ORG Burma Visit  ] ------------------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( S ) [ORG DG Hu  ] also outlined the highlights of State Councilor [PER Tang  ] 's recent visit to [LOC Burma  ] , relating that [PER Tang  ] delivered a strong , clear message to General [PER Than  ] and [LOC Burma  ] 's other leaders . 
The main meeting lasted nearly three hours . 
" We worked on them this time , " said [ORG DG Hu  ] , who accompanied [PER Tang  ] on the trip . 
According to [ORG DG Hu  ] , [PER Tang  ] urged [LOC Burma  ] to take actions to address international concerns . 
The generals said they would welcome a visit from any new [ORG UN  ] Special Envoy and that they are open to communication with [ORG National League for Democracy  ] leader [PER Aung San Suu Kyi  ] , which they have initiated via written correspondence . 
[ORG DG Hu  ] related that [LOC Burma  ] 's leaders said [ORG National Conventions  ] will convene during the coming year and a new constitution will be completed by the end of 2007 . 
The generals are considering establishment of political parties , eventually allowing these groups to fully enter the political arena . 
They envision transferring power to " a government that represents the will of the people of [LOC Burma  ] at an appropriate time , " [ORG DG Hu  ] quoted the generals as saying. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( S ) The generals currently have three priorities , [ORG DG Hu  ] continued , 1 ) domestic stability , particularly with regard to ending armed ethnic opposition , 2 ) economic growth , which [ORG DG Hu  ] described as " okay " but not great in [LOC Burma  ] , and 3 ) education and training . 
On economic growth , [LOC Burma  ] is paying close attention to [LOC China  ] 's experience and wants to enhance exchanges in this realm . 
Mutual Interests in [LOC Southeast Asia  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( S ) On regional issues , in his meeting ith [ORG AFM  ] [PER Cui  ] , DAS [PER John  ] stressed that [LOC Washington  ] and [LOC Beijing  ] should capitalize on their mutual interest in promoting stability and prosperity in [LOC Southeast Asia  ] to dispel the perception that the two are competing in a zero-sum game . 
The [LOC United States  ] hopes that [LOC China  ] 's expanding trade relations in the region will complement our long-standing efforts to promote democracy and development . 
[ORG AFM  ] [PER Cui  ] said [LOC Beijing  ] 's interest in [LOC Southeast Asia  ] is not a threat , but a logical result of geography , including [LOC China  ] 's 2,500 mile land border with [LOC Southeast Asian  ] nations and sharing of the [LOC South China  ] Sea . 
Besides being [LOC China  ] 's neighbor , [LOC Southeast Asia  ] is also home to millions of " overseas [MISC Chinese  ] . 
" ( [ORG Note: Beijing  ] defines any person of [MISC Chinese  ] ancestry , regardless of citizenship , as " overseas [MISC Chinese  ] . 
" End note . 
) The [LOC United States  ] and [LOC China  ] must discourage the [MISC Cold War  ] mentality that cooperating with one of us is an inherent rejection of the other , [ORG AFM  ] [PER Cui  ] said . 
Starting with peace efforts in [LOC Cambodia  ] and continuing through extensive cooperation in the [ORG Asian Regional Form  ] ( [ORG ARF  ] ) and responding to the [ORG Asian Financial Crisis  ] , the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC China  ] have demonstrated the benefits of working together. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( S ) With [ORG DG Hu  ] , [PER DAS John  ] noted that this year marks the 30th anniversary of United [MISC States-ASEAN  ] relations , which we look forward to commemorating with a presidential summit in the second half of the year . 
Remarking that [LOC China  ] celebrated 15 years of relations with [MISC ASEAN  ] at 2006 summit , [ORG DG Hu  ] stressed the importance of the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC China  ] supporting one another in maintaining a strong relationship with [MISC ASEAN  ] . 
The [LOC United States  ] and [LOC China  ] should seek joint regional projects to demonstrate to [MISC ASEAN  ] nations that they need not choose between the two . 
[ORG DG Hu  ] suggested that our ambassadors in the region find joint opportunities to highlight our engagement with [MISC ASEAN  ] . 
[LOC Indonesia  ] --------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( S ) The [LOC United States  ] and [LOC China  ] must work together to promote democratization , economic growth and counter-terrorism in [LOC Indonesia  ] , [PER DAS John  ] stressed to [ORG DG Hu  ] . 
While President [PER Susilo Yudhoyono  ] has taken positive steps , we must encourage further transparency , accountability and military reform . 
[LOC Beijing  ] should join [LOC Washington  ] in pressing for better governance and accountability in the military , the [ORG Tentara Nasional Indonesia  ] ( [ORG TNI  ] ) . 
Transparency in the [ORG TNI  ] would reinforce and encourage transparency in [LOC Indonesia  ] 's [LOC BEIJING  ] 00001448 004.2 OF 004 government and public affairs in general , essential to attracting much-needed foreign investment . 
We must also press for reforms in labor and investment laws , as well as judicious enforcement of those laws , DAS [PER John  ] urged [ORG DG Hu.  ] <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( S ) Accepting that [LOC China  ] can influence " the general direction " of development in [LOC Indonesia  ] , [ORG DG Hu  ] cautioned that [LOC Beijing  ] must be sensitive to the political reality of a significant ethnic [MISC Chinese  ] population in [LOC Indonesia  ] . 
[LOC Beijing  ] was " not impressed " with the presidents who led [LOC Indonesia  ] the aftermath of the [ORG Asian Financial Crisis  ] in the late 1990s , but has been pleased with President [PER Yudhoyono  ] 's progress since taking power in 2004 , [ORG DG Hu  ] said . 
[LOC Jakarta  ] faces the challenge of decreasing the influence of the military and promoting democracy , while simultaneously responding to growing ethnic and religious tension . 
[LOC Beijing  ] seeks to promote secular [PER Islam  ] in [LOC Indonesia  ] by encouraging interaction with [LOC China  ] 's 20 million [MISC Muslims  ] . 
In recent years , the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC China  ] have coordinated in providing assistance to [LOC Indonesia  ] following natural disasters . 
[LOC Beijing  ] sees such cooperation as a model for further such regional cooperation , [ORG DG Hu  ] said . 
Desperately Seeking Stability in [LOC East Timor  ] ------------------------------------------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( S ) [LOC Beijing  ] looks forward to cooperating with [LOC Washington  ] to promote stability in [LOC East Timor  ] , [ORG DG Hu  ] said , noting that he would instruct [LOC China  ] 's Ambassador to call on the new [LOC United States  ] Ambassador when he arrives in [LOC Dili  ] . 
[LOC Beijing  ] 's primary concerns in [LOC East Timor  ] are alleviating poverty and avoiding a power struggle among large countries for influence there . 
DAS [PER John  ] stressed [LOC Washington  ] 's desire for [LOC East Timor  ] 's government to succeed and highlighted our cooperation with [LOC Portugal  ] and [LOC Australia  ] towards achieving this goal . 
[PER Hu  ] and [PER John  ] agreed that the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC PRC  ] embassies in [LOC Dili  ] should enhance their coordination . 
Progress in the [LOC Philippines  ] , but More Needed -------------------------------------------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( S ) Seeing poverty as the key challenge facing the [LOC Philippines  ] , [LOC China  ] has invested in its agricultural development and transportation infrastructure , [ORG DG Hu  ] underlined . 
[LOC Beijing  ] recognizes corruption as the second significant problem facing the [LOC Philippines  ] , but believes it " cannot do much about that , " [ORG DG Hu  ] said . 
[LOC Beijing  ] sees President [PER Gloria Arroyo  ] as a good leader because she has shown that " she is in control . 
" DAS [PER John  ] agreed President [PER Arroyo  ] has stabilized [MISC Philippine  ] leadership and enacted strong fiscal and economic policy , but stressed that [LOC Beijing  ] and [LOC Washington  ] must encourage [LOC Manila  ] to continue working hard to promote transparency and good governance . 
[PER John  ] also outlined the extremely successful approach to counterterrorism the [ORG GRP  ] has taken in [LOC Mindanao  ] , with the support of the [LOC United States  ] . 
[ORG DG Hu  ] assessed that , while " working from different directions , " [LOC United States  ] and [MISC Chinese  ] efforts in the [LOC Philippines  ] are complementary . 
Reinforcing Democracy in Post-Coup [LOC Thailand  ] ------------------------------------------- <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( S ) [LOC Thailand  ] has a long history of peaceful democracy , which is in [LOC China  ] 's interest to support , [ORG DG Hu  ] said . 
While not an ideal turn of events , the September 2006 coup emanated from " very specific circumstances " and did not involve violence , [ORG DG Hu  ] said . 
Noting that he had just returned from [LOC Thailand  ] , [ORG DG Hu  ] quipped that , even with the coup , [LOC Thailand  ] is still more democratic than [LOC Singapore  ] , highlighting his belief that the coup was an aberration in [MISC Thai  ] politics rather than a signal of long-term change . 
Still , given the recent resignation of former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance [PER Pridiyathorn Thewakun  ] and the reality that King [PER Phumiphon Adunyadet  ] will not live forever , [LOC Beijing  ] is closely monitoring the political situation in [LOC Bangkok  ] . 
[LOC China  ] has invited [MISC Thai  ] Prime Minister [PER Surayut Chulanon  ] to visit [LOC China  ] in late May and hopes to use the visit as an opportunity to demonstrate [LOC Beijing  ] 's support for a stable , peaceful transition of power in [LOC Thailand  ] , [ORG DG Hu  ] said. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 .
