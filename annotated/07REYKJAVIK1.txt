( [ORG U  ] ) [MISC Summary:  ] Following the closure of [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Naval Air Station  ] Keflavik in September 2006 , the [ORG Government of Iceland  ] has begun reaching out to other [ORG NATO  ] allies to solicit interest in security cooperation - and demonstrate to the public , in an election year , that it will protect them . 
December 2006 visits of an [MISC Icelandic  ] delegation to [LOC Denmark  ] and a [MISC Norwegian  ] delegation to [LOC Iceland  ] produced no agreements ( nor were they expected to ) , but set the stage for follow-on talks in late January/early February . 
The [ORG GOI  ] has also announced plans for exploratory talks with [LOC Canada  ] and [LOC Britain  ] in early 2007. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Reflecting a growing realization within the Government that [LOC Iceland  ] will find it easier to encourage allied cooperation in the [MISC North Atlantic  ] if [LOC Reykjavik  ] increases its own contributions to the [ORG Alliance  ] , [LOC Iceland  ] will start contributing to the [ORG NATO  ] Infrastructure Fund in 2007 . 
Increasingly , leading media and other opinion makers seem prepared to accept that [LOC Iceland  ] can and should contribute to its own defense and to [ORG Alliance  ] operations both in and out of area . 
End summary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) In the months since the September 2006 closure of [MISC Naval Air Station  ] Keflavik ( [ORG NASKEF  ] ) , the [ORG Government of Iceland  ] has made overtures to several [ORG NATO  ] allies regarding security cooperation in the [MISC North Atlantic  ] . 
Most substantively , the [ORG GOI  ] has begun a process of bilateral talks with [LOC Denmark  ] and [LOC Norway  ] regarding cooperation on air defense/surveillance exercises , search and rescue , and maritime patrol . 
In its public discussion of the issue , the [ORG GOI  ] has tied its long-standing desire for visible air defense to forecasts of rising maritime traffic in the next few years , and arguing that this creates an increased need for multilateral security engagement in the region. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Danish  ] and [MISC Icelandic  ] delegations met in [LOC Copenhagen  ] on December 18 for a first set of talks , and set a follow-on date for February in [LOC Reykjavik  ] . 
The [MISC Icelandic  ] delegation consisted of the " [MISC Committee of Three  ] " that has policy coordination responsibility for defense and security issues: the Prime Minister 's [ORG Foreign Affairs Advisor  ] , the Permanent Secretary of the [ORG Ministry for Foreign Affairs  ] ( [ORG MFA  ] ) , and the Head of Police and [ORG Justice Affairs  ] at the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] ( [ORG MOJ  ] ) . <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Generally positive press reports quoted both sides' assurances of further cooperation , while [PER FM Sverrisdottir  ] said the meeting had been more positive than she anticipated . 
News reports further indicated that [MISC Icelandic-Danish  ] cooperation would seek to build on existing [ORG Coast Guard  ] and [ORG Naval  ] patrols of the countries' economic zones and collaboration in search and rescue . 
A [MISC Danish  ] source confirmed that the talks had indeed gone quite well , and that the follow-up talks in February would be more extensive . 
Additionally , he noted that in a separate but related initiative , [LOC Denmark  ] 's Minister of Defense will arrive in [LOC Reykjavik  ] on January 10 for the signing of a long-planned Memorandum of Understanding on security cooperation with the [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG MOJ.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) From December 19-20 , a [MISC Norwegian  ] delegation of [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] and [ORG MFA  ] representatives came to [LOC Iceland  ] , first for talks at the [ORG MFA  ] and subsequently for a tour of facilities at the former [ORG NASKEF  ] site . 
Post facilitated the tour by providing an escort and access to [MISC NATO-owned  ] facilities at the site ( facilities for which the [LOC U.S.  ] still holds the keys and pays the bills as [ORG NATO  ] host nation ) and a briefing by [ORG Embassy  ] 's resident EUCOM MilRep . 
In a pre-visit press article as well as press statements while the delegation was in [LOC Reykjavik  ] , [MISC Norwegian  ] officials said that the [MISC Norwegian  ] government is looking towards [LOC Iceland  ] for cooperation in order to step up its security on important shipping routes in the area. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Iceland  ] has also looked to start similar discussions with the [LOC U.K.  ] and [LOC Canada  ] . 
[ORG MFA PermSec Gretar Mar Sigurdsson  ] told the press in December that an [MISC Icelandic  ] delegation will meet with officials in [LOC London  ] January 16 . 
A [MISC British  ] source confirmed that the " [MISC Committee of Three  ] " will have talks at the [ORG Foreign and Commonwealth Office  ] and the Prime Minister 's [ORG Office  ] , adding that the [ORG GOI  ] was unrealistically raising public expectations of the level of [MISC British  ] interest . 
Similarly , [MISC Canadian  ] and other sources tell us that the [ORG GOI  ] 's reports of " defense talks " with [LOC Canada  ] reflect nothing more than a planned visit by the [MISC Canadian  ] Defense Attache in [LOC Oslo  ] , though [LOC Iceland  ] hopes for more to follow. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Throughout the newest round of consultations , the [ORG GOI  ] has been at pains to say that [LOC Iceland  ] is not requesting permanent stationing of military forces in [LOC Iceland  ] , nor is it asking other [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000001 002.2 OF 002 states to initiate any new financial or resource commitments vis-a-vis [LOC Iceland  ] ( i.e. , " replacing the [MISC Americans  ] " ) . 
Officials at both the [ORG MFA  ] and Prime Minister 's office told post they hoped these moves would complement but not replace the post-NASKEF security ties [LOC Iceland  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] are building , a line that the [ORG MFA  ] 's [LOC PermSec  ] has taken publicly as well. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [ORG GOI  ] also now seems to be interested in contributing more to [ORG NATO  ] in the hopes of getting more out of the [ORG Alliance  ] . 
On December 18 conservative , generally pro-GOI [ORG Morgunbladid  ] reported ( and applauded ) that [LOC Iceland  ] recently became a party to the [ORG NATO  ] Infrastructure Fund and will start making payments to it in 2007 . 
The payments will start at a modest $31,500 per year , rising to $408,000/yr in 2016 . 
[ORG Morgunbladid  ] went so far as to urge the Government to begin paying the full amount this year . 
A few voices - including the center-right , but more populist daily Bladid - have grumbled that [LOC Iceland  ] should not be required to pay other allies for defense , but these appear to be outliers to a growing consensus that [LOC Iceland  ] should contribute to its own security. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: These first efforts at reaching out to the allies come in the wake of prominent local news reports that [PER FM Sverrisdottir  ] had arranged for bilateral talks with [LOC Denmark  ] , [LOC Norway  ] , [LOC Britain  ] , and [LOC Canada  ] when she attended November 's [ORG NATO  ] summit in [LOC Riga  ] . 
Many here expressed doubt that those countries were as interested in discussing security cooperation with [LOC Iceland  ] as the [PER FM  ] made them out to be - putting heat on the [ORG GOI  ] to deliver some bilats , potentially opening itself to further charges of exaggeration if nothing concrete emerges. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) This backdrop should not distract from the important development that the [ORG GOI  ] appears to have crossed a crucial line in thinking about defense as a multilateral cooperative endeavor in which [LOC Iceland  ] should be a partner , rather than as something that the [MISC Americans  ] ( or other allies ) should be expected to provide at no cost . 
A key test of this assertion will be the extent to which [LOC Iceland  ] agrees to provide support ( e.g. billeting , fuel , Search and Rescue services ) to [LOC U.S.  ] or other forces contemplating exercises in and around [LOC Iceland.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) It is also indicative of more mature thinking on security in [LOC Iceland  ] outside the halls of government that key opinion leaders are welcoming [LOC Iceland  ] 's participation in its own defense by contributing to the [ORG NATO  ] Infrastructure Fund , and actively looking for international partners for search and rescue operations and air surveillance during peacetime . 
[LOC Iceland  ] 's commitment ( reftel ) to maintaining its contribution to peacekeeping in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Sri Lanka  ] , and other hot spots - even as it seeks roles appropriate to a nation with no military forces or tradition - is a further reflection of [MISC Icelanders'  ] reluctant but growing acceptance that ( to paraphrase [PER Trotsky  ] ) they may not be interested in war , but war is interested in them .
