( U ) SUMMARY . 
The [ORG AIVD  ] , the [MISC Dutch  ] civilian intelligence service , issued a report March 30 on the terrorist threat in the [LOC Netherlands  ] , entitled " " Violent Jihad in the [MISC Netherlands: Current Trends  ] in the [MISC Islamist Terrorist Threat  ] . 
" " The report concludes that the terrorist threat in the [LOC Netherlands  ] now comes primarily from decentralized local networks based in the country , and that a process of " " autonomous radicalization , " " primarily through the [MISC Internet  ] , is replacing top-down recruitment by charismatic leaders as the principal source of radicalization and incitement to violent action. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) A trend toward " " virtualization of jihad , " " in which extremist groups use the [MISC Internet  ] to spread the ideology of violent Jihad , maintain contacts , and obtain training is also noted . 
The report highlights an increasingly prominent role played by radicalized young women and [MISC Dutch  ] converts among extremist groups in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
The report argues that countering the terrorist threat requires a wellbalanced , comprehensive effort that promotes integration , encourages the [MISC Islamic  ] community to resist radicalization , and represses terrorist groups . 
End Summary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) The report is part of a periodic series of [ORG AIVD  ] reports on terrorist trends . 
The full text has been emailed to [MISC EUR/UBI  ] , [PER S/CT  ] and INR . 
" " Violent Jihad " " examines four trends in [MISC Islamic  ] terrorism in [LOC Europe  ] and the specific situation in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
The trends identified are: a shift from external foreign terrorist threat to an indigenous , or home-grown , terrorism , which the [ORG AIVD  ] terms " " [MISC European  ] jihad ; " " a top-down process of decentralization and local implantation of jihadist networks ; an " " opposing but complementary " " grass-roots process of radicalization and emergence of local jihadist networks ; and the " " virtualization of jihad , " " in which the [MISC Internet  ] has become the primary mechanism for dissemination of radical [MISC Islam  ] and recruitment for [MISC Jihad.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) In the [LOC Netherlands  ] the principal terrorist threat is now from decentralized local networks based in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
These groups are comprised primarily of young [MISC Dutch  ] [MISC Moroccans  ] between 15 and 25 years old , often of [LOC Berber  ] background , who are seeking their identity and status in [MISC Dutch  ] society . 
The recruitment and radicalization of young [MISC Muslims  ] born and bred in the [LOC Netherlands  ] takes place principally through the [MISC Internet  ] . 
" " Top down " " recruitment by charismatic leaders in mosques has largely been replaced by " " bottom up " " radicalization by groups of youths who discover radical [MISC Islam  ] together , and incite each other to join the armed struggle . 
The [ORG AIVD  ] refers to this phenomenon as " " autonomous radicalization . 
" " <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) According to the report , factors that play a role in radicalization and the willingness of young [MISC Dutch  ] [MISC Muslims  ] to use violence include frustration and dissatisfaction with their social position . 
They identify with neither the traditional [MISC Islamic  ] culture of their parents nor secular [MISC Dutch  ] society . 
Even relatively well-educated [MISC Dutch  ] [MISC Moroccans  ] are often dissatisfied with their place in society , in part as a result of discrimination and high rates of unemployment . 
Young second and third generation [MISC Dutch  ] [MISC Muslims  ] from other ethnic backgrounds are also seeking their identities within [MISC Dutch  ] society , but undergo the process of radicalization to a significantly lesser extent than [MISC Dutch  ] [MISC Moroccans  ] . 
Radicalized young women are playing a more prominent and activist role in Jihad groups in the [LOC Netherlands  ] than in other [MISC European  ] countries . 
There is also a high profile group of [MISC Dutch  ] converts to [MISC Islam  ] among the radicalized networks .

End COMMENT . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) The attraction of radical [MISC Islam  ] for [MISC Dutch  ] Muslim youth has grown since the 2004 murder of [PER Theo van Gogh  ] . 
The report stresses , however , that most radicalized youth adhere to non-violent forms of political [MISC Islam  ] ; only as small minority join violent Jihad groups . 
Receptiveness to radicalization and readiness to engage in violent action , which the [ORG AIVD  ] terms " " jihadization , " " results from a combination of youths' fixation on " " pure " " [MISC Islam  ] as described in extremist websites and chat rooms , and dissatisfaction with local and international political and social circumstances , such as perceived discrimination against [MISC Islam  ] in the [LOC West  ] and the war in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
THE HAGUE 00000834 002 OF 003 <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) Jihad networks in the [LOC Netherlands  ] are driven primarily by domestic political events and have a strong focus on [MISC Dutch  ] socio-political issues . 
The report stresses that in contrast to local networks in other [MISC European  ] countries , which tend to seek " " soft " " targets frequented by large numbers of civilians , [MISC Dutch  ] groups tend to target individual politicians -- such as outspoken parliamentarians [PER Aayan Hirsi Ali  ] and [PER Gert Wilders  ] -- and opinion leaders they consider to be " " enemies of [MISC Islam  ] . 
" " <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) The [ORG AIVD  ] has identified 10 to 20 loosely organized Jihad networks in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
The [ORG Hofstad Group  ] is the best-known [MISC Dutch  ] local network . 
A network may have a permanent core of one or two persons surrounded by a limited number of active supporters , but it can also consist of dozens of people around a changing core group . 
Most Jihad networks operating in the [LOC Netherlands  ] are comprised of [MISC European  ] born individuals with [MISC Islamic  ] backgrounds . 
Although these local groups often have contacts with other local and international groups , they are normally not controlled by external groups , but act instead on their own initiative in response to local developments. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) According to the [ORG AIVD  ] , radicalization often develops into " " jihadization " " during small , informal discussions . 
Sometimes a charismatic leader plays a central role . 
For example , a [MISC Syrian  ] preacher was initially the main inspiration for the [ORG Hofstad Group  ] , though other group members , in particular van [PER Gogh  ] murderer [PER Mohamed Bouyeri  ] , also made ideological contributions to the radicalization process . 
Many local networks in the [LOC Netherlands  ] are heavily influenced by " " neo-Takfir " " ideology , which the [ORG AIVD  ] describes as a [MISC European  ] adaptation of the extremist [ORG Takfir Wal Hijra  ] ideology developed in [LOC Egypt  ] in the 1960s . 
The relatively simplistic , often incoherent " " neo-Takfir " " ideology justifies the use of violence against nonbelievers . 
In addition , the report notes the evolution of a local [MISC Dutch  ] variant on radical [MISC Islam  ] ; though it does not lead directly to violent action , it does appear to lower the threshold for advocating Jihad . 
The " " neo-Takfir " " networks are almost all interlinked to some extent , according to the report . 
Some individuals linked to local networks are planning to travel to [LOC Iraq  ] or other conflict areas to join the Jihad there , but most are focused on conducting Jihad at home. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) In addition to these " " home grown " " groups , there are a number of locally established internationally oriented networks , which are controlled from abroad , or in which foreign recruiters living in the [LOC Netherlands  ] play a key role . 
There are a limited number of transnational networks in the [LOC Netherlands  ] , according to the [ORG AIVD  ] . 
The report downplays the role of [ORG Al Qaeda  ] as a " " strategic mastermind " " steering worldwide Jihad networks and preparing attacks , suggesting it has instead become a " " brand name " " and inspiration for decentralized Jihad networks that take action based on local conditions. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) The report raises the concern that the local networks will increasingly link up with international Jihadist elements . 
It states that the highest threat comes when the experience and methods of international networks are linked with the youthful enthusiasm for martyrdom of the local networks . 
There is some evidence that local networks in the [LOC Netherlands  ] are going through a continuous learning process , and thus becoming more " " professional . 
" " For example , the arrests and trials of [ORG Hofstad Group  ] members have made them aware of police and [ORG AIVD  ] strategy and tactics , and they have since displayed more sophistication in protecting their [MISC Internet  ] communications. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( U ) Moving from the specifics of the violent threat from Jihad networks to broader societal effects , the report stresses that radicalization not only raises the threat of terrorist attacks in the short term , but also jeopardizes social cohesion and solidarity in [MISC Dutch  ] society , and ultimately poses a threat to the democratic order of the country . 
It posits that an effective counter-terrorism policy must be linked to promoting integration and mobilizing resistance within the [MISC Islamic  ] community against radicalization , as well as the implementation of measures to prevent radicalization and repress terrorist individuals and networks . 
THE HAGUE 00000834 003 OF 003 <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( U ) The report concludes that the Jihad threat might diminish if the [LOC Netherlands  ] succeeds in reversing the trend of radicalization and " " Jihadization . 
" " To accomplish this , it stresses , it is crucial to achieve a balance between protecting citizens from terrorism and preventing unjustified anxiety and social polarization , particularly since the latter could stimulate further radicalization. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( SBU ) Comment . 
The [ORG AIVD  ] report provides a thoughtful review of developments in the terrorist threat in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
In documenting the social and psychological roots of the on-going processes of radicalization and receptiveness to violent Jihad among [MISC Dutch  ] born [MISC Muslim  ] youth , it makes clear , as [ORG AIVD  ] Director van [LOC Hulst  ] states in his foreword , that the terrorist threat is " " increasingly rooted " " in [MISC Dutch  ] society . 
By highlighting the need for a strong effort to promote integration and avoid further polarization to counter the threat , the report makes a useful contribution to the on-going policy debate about how to respond effectively to the threat posed by " " home-grown " " [MISC Muslim  ] extremists without demonizing all [MISC Muslims  ] in the [LOC Netherlands  ] .
