<code><pre>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 [LOC HAVANA  ] 009102 SIPDIS SIPDIS STATE DEPT FOR WHA/CCA E.O. 12958: [LOC DECL:  ] 04/27/2016 TAGS: <a href='/tag/PHUM_0.html'>PHUM</a> <a href='/tag/KDEM_0.html'>KDEM</a> <a href='/tag/SOCI_0.html'>SOCI</a> <a href='/tag/CU_0.html'>CU</a> SUBJECT: ROCA , [PER SANCHEZ  ] RAP USINT'S [MISC INTERNET-ACCESS  ] POLICY REF: [LOC HAVANA  ] 8769 Classified By: [ORG COM  ] [PER Michael Parmly  ] for Reason 1.4 ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] on April 18 requested a meeting with [ORG COM  ] , without declaring the reason . 
At the April 24 meeting , they presented a list of 10 independent journalists banned from [ORG USINT  ] 's two [ORG Internet Centers  ] since 2004 , saying they had been unfairly blacklisted . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] called the bans excessive and said they amount to a professional death blow for independent journalists . 
They called on [ORG USINT  ] to reconsider its punishment . 
The 10 are among a relatively small number of [MISC Cubans  ] whose [MISC Internet  ] privileges were revoked for repeatedly disturbing other users , mistreating [ORG USINT  ] staffers or committing other offenses . 
[ORG COM  ] explained that access to our [MISC Internet  ] centers requires appropriate conduct . 
The two dissidents and [ORG COM  ] also discussed the [LOC Santiago/Havana  ] divide , the transfer of [PER Gustavo Machin  ] , and what keeps [PER Fidel Castro  ] up until three in the morning . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] , requested a meeting with [ORG COM  ] . 
At the April 24 meeting , they criticized [ORG USINT  ] 's practice of banning visits to our [ORG Internet Centers  ] by [MISC Cubans  ] who repeatedly create disturbances there . 
The two handed [ORG COM  ] a one-page letter containing the names of 10 independent journalists who they described as " people of proven political and civil credibility " who " work every day for democracy in [LOC Cuba  ] " but who since 2004 have been denied access to [ORG USINT  ] 's two [MISC Internet-access  ] facilities . 
In a possible swipe at fellow activist [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] , with whom he has had a falling out , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] complained that [ORG USINT  ] officials apparently blacklisted some or all of the 10 in 2004 after conferring with [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
He said many of the independent journalists were blacklisted after failing to write about [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] to [ORG Promote Civil Society  ] , or writing about it in an unfavorable light . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] asked the [ORG COM  ] to reconsider the bans , calling them draconian and saying they put independent journalists -- already tormented by the [ORG GOC  ] -- in a double bind . 
[ORG COM  ] DEFENDS NEED FOR DISCIPLINE ------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [ORG COM  ] accepted the note and promised to discuss its contents with other [ORG USINT  ] staffers , who he characterized as committed to fair play . 
However , he defended the need for discipline at [ORG USINT  ] 's [MISC Internet  ] centers and said [ORG USINT  ] does not play favorites or politics with regard to access to the [LOC Lincoln  ] or [ORG Roosevelt Centers  ] . 
The [ORG COM  ] noted that [ORG USINT  ] is encouraging other countries with a diplomatic presence in [LOC Havana  ] to offer [MISC Internet  ] access . 
( [ORG Note:  ] The [MISC Norwegian  ] Embassy provides [MISC Internet  ] access to some [MISC Cubans  ] through one computer terminal . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] are reportedly planning a center , while the [MISC British  ] and [ORG Czechs  ] are said to be considering such a move . 
The [MISC Canadians  ] are planning an [MISC Internet  ] center with some eight computers . 
End note . 
) CUBA'S EAST/WEST DIVIDE ----------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Discussion then turned to the physical and psychological divide between [LOC Havana  ] , in the [LOC West  ] , and [ORG Santiago  ] in the [LOC East  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] , just back from a trip to his native [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] , said the city is virtually garbage-free , unlike [LOC Havana  ] , and that [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] take tremendous pride in their city . 
He added that they are loath to criticize [PER Fidel Castro  ] for the [ORG GOC  ] 's shortcomings , choosing instead to vilify local leaders , including the First Secretary of [ORG Santiago  ] 's [ORG Communist Party  ] office . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] then criticized [PER Castro  ] as " mono-thematic , " saying he is unable to focus on more than one thing at a time . 
He added that from 8 pm to 3 am each day , [PER Castro  ] reviews the latest reports on [ORG State Security  ] operations , in an effort " to continue the control , the blackmailing . 
" On the [MISC Cuban  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] 's reported assignment of [PER Gustavo Machin  ] , head of the [MISC North American  ] bureau , to an ambassadorial post in [LOC Pakistan  ] , the [ORG COM  ] said the move appeared to be a demotion . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] agreed that at worst , it is a demotion , but at best , it is an opportunity for [PER Machin  ] to focus on examining [LOC U.S.  ] intelligence efforts in [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) It 's unclear what prompted [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] to [LOC HAVANA  ] 00009102 002.2 OF 002 criticize the [MISC Internet-access  ] policy of [ORG USINT  ] , historically their strongest and most important ally . 
They could be acting out of principle , trying to win favor with other dissidents , attempting to burnish their own credentials - or all three . 
Either way , we found it unpalatable that at a time when very few [MISC Cubans  ] enjoy [MISC Internet  ] access and one activist is starving himself to make that point , key dissidents would fault [ORG USINT  ] for acting to ensure that the [ORG Centers  ] function fairly for all approved users . 
It should also be noted that the credibility of both [PER Sanchez  ] and [PER Roca  ] has long been a matter of speculation . 
[PER Sanchez  ] was at one point undeniably linked to [ORG State Security  ] , and similar accusations have long surrounded [PER Roca  ] . 
[PER Roca  ] 's past as a [ORG GOC  ] insider lends credence to his astute observation that [PER Machin  ] may have been sent to [LOC Pakistan  ] to develop spy networks . 
Regarding [PER Roca  ] 's assertion that [PER Fidel  ] is " mono-thematic , " we acknowledge that the dictator can be seized by a single issue . 
However ( reftel ) , he has managed to juggle a number of issues this year , including energy revolution , moves against corruption , and the [ORG GOC  ] 's propaganda response to [LOC U.S  ] .
