[LOC LIMA  ] 1418 Classified By: PolCouns [PER Alexander Margulies  ] . 
Reason: 1.4 ( b , d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [MISC Summary: Although  ] the various cocalero groups remain fragmented with no national leadership or strategy , they are courted by disparate radical elements in [MISC Peruvian  ] society who view the cocaleros as potential allies . 
In addition , there is evidence that narcotraffickers are arming and radicalizing cocaleros creating an increasing threat to eradication teams . 
[MISC Bolivian  ] followers of [PER Evo Morales  ] are traveling widely in the [LOC Apurimac  ] and [LOC Ene  ] river valleys ( [ORG VRAE  ] ) area to garner support for a MAS-style [MISC Peruvian  ] cocalero party . 
A coca researcher 's recent visit to the [ORG VRAE  ] during the last two weeks of April found cocaleros eager to be the ones to down a helicopter . 
The [MISC Peruvian  ] [ORG National Police  ] ( [ORG PNP  ] ) are responding with interdiction operations in the [ORG Upper Huallaga Valleys  ] and [ORG VRAE  ] , and they plan a prolonged eradication operation in the area of recent helicopter attacks in [LOC Polvora-Pizana  ] area of [LOC San Martin  ] . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In the wake of the fizzled Third Cocalero [ORG Congress  ] ( Ref E ) , cocalero organizations have still failed to develop an effective national strategy or organization . 
However , cocaleros constitute an increasingly vocal single-issue bloc in their own areas , and local cocalero power is turning some districts into no-man 's lands that defy the limited capacity of law enforcement to respond ; [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] a lon time Embassy contact told [PER Poloff  ] on 5/3 of his recent investigation of [ORG VRAE  ] coca growing areas ; he found his contacts increasingly reluctant to share information as the long reach of narcotraffickers made talking to outsiders risky. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] contacts reported no knowledge of [MISC Venezuelan  ] agents in the [LOC Apurimac  ] valleys , but they said that [MISC Bolivian  ] representatives of the [ORG MAS  ] party were frequent visitors . 
From a trip to [LOC Cuzco  ] several weeks earlier , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] reported that [MISC Bolivian  ] [ORG MAS  ] representatives were making a heavy recruiting effort . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that the failure of [ORG MAS  ] leader [PER Evo Morales  ] to complete a planned trip to [LOC Cuzco  ] in early April was the main reason that [LOC Cuzco  ] cocaleros did not rally to form a MAS-style party. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] contacts reported that [ORG APRA  ] party representatives were also canvassing cocalero areas in [LOC Cuzco  ] and the [ORG Apurimac Valleys  ] , but that other political parties were not in evidence except for " [LOC Peru  ] [ORG Ahora  ] , " a traditional supporter of cocalero causes . 
His contacts saw little serious effort by labor unions to court cocaleros in these areas . 
( Note: Labor centrals and left-wing parties have supported cocalero protests in [LOC Lima  ] and other urban areas , but their courtship has not/not extended to aggressive outreach to the cocaleros in their home areas . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) What was increasing in the [ORG VRAE  ] districts , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , was the takeover of local politic by cocaleros and narcotraffickers . 
He noted that the creation of new districts in 1992 during the [LOC Fujimori  ] era , designed to increase state presence in remote areas , had backfired , with whole districts having city councils and mayoral administrations that favored cocalero interests . 
Examples were [MISC Pichali  ] , [PER Santa Rosa  ] and [ORG Sivia  ] districts in the [ORG VRAE  ] . 
The increased buying power of cocaleros was one reason for this infiltration of coca into local politics , fueled by a significant increase in the hectarage under cultivation. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Cocalero influence was gradually seeping into provincial and regional politics , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] continued . 
( Note: decentralization is bringing increasing control at the regional and provincial level over government financial resources . 
End Note . 
) The [ORG La Convencion Province  ] ( [ORG Cuzco Department  ] ) , for example , recently included in its budget a line item for the " sacred leaf . 
" [LOC Ayacucho Regional President  ] [PER Omar Quesada  ] ( who in January declared coca a cultural patrimony ) did a publicized walking tour in late April to connect with residents abutting a road project running through provincial capital [LOC Querobamba  ] ( a relatively new province , created in 1986 ) . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , s contacts reported that at night [PER Quesada  ] met with cocaleros after his publicized development meetings during the day . 
In March , [PER Quesada  ] signed a declaration with [LOC Ayacucho  ] cocaleros calling on the GOP to suspend all eradication efforts and for an end to alternative development programs . 
( Note: When PolCouns confronted [ORG APRA  ] co-Secretary General [PER Jorge del Castillo  ] with this declaration , the latter stated that this did not reflect [ORG APRA  ] 's position and that he would take this mater up with the party 's political committee . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The potential for cocalero violence appears to be growing . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] contacts uniformly reported that narcotraffickers were training and arming cocaleros . 
Local employment is increasing of non-growers ( frequently family members of growers ) for trafficking-related tasks such as transporting coca paste with backpacks , driving pack mules , operating maceration pits , manual labor for cocaine labs and joining narcotraffickers as foot soldiers . 
The cocaleros were increasingly receptive , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , to viewing their coca fields as something worth fighting for and to the offer of arms and firearm training to effect defense of their fields . 
Cocaine labs were increasing , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] continued , and the highest-paying jobs went to those entrusted with delivering cocaine to [LOC Lima.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) While [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , s visit yielded little evidence of direct [ORG Sendero Luminoso  ] ( [ORG SL  ] ) activity in the [ORG VRAE  ] , the narcotrafficker influence made the area equally dangerous . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] on this trip was unable to enter areas tha he had on previous trips . 
The contacts that would speak to him reported that any contact with outsiders was increasingly dangerous . 
Many people have disappeared in recent months , either from running afoul of narcotraffickers or victims of local score-settling that the lawless climate facilitates. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The high level of organization that cocaleros have used to menace helicopters on eradication missions further north in the [ORG Upper Huallaga River  ] region ( Refs A - D ) is an indication of an escalation in their organization , training and tactics . 
In a tactic that has become common during eradication operations over the past weeks , cocaleros hang back during eradication and the initial stages of evacuation of the eradicators and their security elements . 
When all helicopters have departed save one , and the [ORG PNP  ] security is withdrawing to mount the last helicopter , the cocaleros then close in with extensive launching of rocks ( up to 2 lbs ) from long-range slings . 
Security police and crew departing from the last helos have reported that the front line of cocaleros will launch their rocks , then crouch so that a second , and then a third line of rock-slingers can launch their projectiles against the helo cabin and rotor blades. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , s visit to the [ORG VRAE  ] came after the April 12 attacks to the north ( Refs A - D ) ; his contacts reported the wide dissemination of the perceived success by cocaleros and their allies in damaging the helicopters . 
Groups of cocaleros held parties to celebrate the helicopter attacks . 
Several contacts noted that in past years [ORG SL  ] fighters had poor success in downing Army helicopters [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , s contacts further reported that many [LOC Apurimac  ] cocaleros in the [ORG VRAE  ] expressed hopes that they could be involved in the downing of a helicopter. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) While so far cocaleros have used sling-launched rocks against eradicators , their security elements and helicopters , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] painted a disturbing picture for the future . 
His contacts in the [ORG VRAE  ] said that narcotraffickers are arming cocaleros there at an unprecedented rate , either selling modern selective-fire rifles such as FN-FALs and Galils - and even rocket launchers - or giving them the arms as an advance on coca sales . 
Cocaleros increasingly perceive their interests as an armed resistance to any eradication efforts in the future. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [ORG National Police  ] chief [PER Marco Miyashiro  ] has noted privately to [MISC Emboffs  ] and publicly that the [ORG PNP  ] , s current emphasis on interdicting cocaine base laboratories is designed , and to a degree has been successful in delinking coca growers from narcotraffickers . 
When [ORG PNP  ] units strike laboratories , coca growers are torn between protecting their own fields and protecting narcotrafficker production labs . 
By and large they choose to stay with their fields , and as a result there have been few large-scale protests or assaults on the [ORG PNP  ] troops while they are destroying the pits . 
An ominous sign for the future , however , is the growing trend that coca growers operate their own maceration pits ; some may begin a more aggressive defense of their pits. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Comment: This report , based chiefly on a well-placed and historically reliable source may not reflect the entire picture but is disturbing . 
GOP helicopters and eradication teams , as well as alternative development workers , will be put at ever higher risk without action by the government to exert state control over the increasingly lawless coca zones such as the [ORG VRAE  ] and [ORG Upper Huallaga  ] . 
The [ORG PNP  ] raid of April 24 ( Ref B ) found evidence that clearly linked the [ORG SL  ] and narco-trafficking in the [ORG San Martin/Ucayali/Huanuco Departments  ] . 
Current [ORG PNP  ] plans to mount extensive operations where helicopters have been attacked are promising . 
The [ORG PNP  ] is continuing interdiction operations in the [ORG Upper Huallaga  ] and in the immediate future , DIRANDRO will deploy 350 counter-narcotic police to the [LOC Polvora-Pizana  ] area in support of a prolonged eradication and interdiction operation . 
In addition , a multi-tiered enforcement operation will begin in the [ORG VRAE  ] in June to destroy cocaine-base labs . 
Enactment of a new coca law that continues to be advanced by some congressmen would probably reinforce the growing power of local and regional coca politicians and give cocaleros an incentive to unite on a national basis ; the Embassy will continue to discourage consideration of a coca law on all fronts .
