REF: A ) TRIPOLI 258 ; B ) TRIPOLI 157 CLASSIFIED BY: [PER Gene Cretz  ] , Ambassador , [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy [LOC Tripoli  ] , [ORG U.S. Department of State  ] . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) On April 6 , the recently-appointed Secretary of the General People 's [ORG Committee for Industry  ] , [ORG Economy and Trade  ] , [PER Mohammad Ali  ] al-Hweij ( minister-equivalent ) met with [PER Andrew Sheridan  ] , [ORG Caterpillar Distribution Manager for Africa and Middle East Region  ] to discuss the specifics of [LOC Libya  ] 's total ban on the import of [ORG Caterpillar  ] equipment ( ref B ) . 
[PER Al-Hweij  ] welcomed all [LOC U.S.  ] companies to the [MISC Libyan  ] market . 
He explained he was personally meeting with [MISC CAT  ] in order to introduce the company to the " behavior of the [MISC Libyan  ] market . 
" He raised the same two points he discussed with the Ambassador on March 24 ( ref A ) , i.e. , that [MISC CAT  ] must have more than one sole agent in [LOC Libya  ] , and that the current [MISC Libyan  ] company acting as [MISC CAT  ] 's agent was headed by the sons of government officials . 
This constituted " corruption " and was illegal . 
[PER Al-Hweij  ] agreed with [PER Sheridan  ] that if the market was too small to support three dealers , two would be fine. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Al-Hweij  ] said as soon as he received a letter from [MISC CAT  ] stating it had terminated the current dealership agreement , he would have the ban lifted . 
He understood it would take [MISC CAT  ] some time to identify the new dealers and he was adamant the [ORG GOL  ] would not make any suggestions as to potential dealers as this would be a " blatant issue of corruption . 
" As for the timing of lifting the ban , it would have to go through the council of ministers and the prime minister , a process al-Hweij said would take around one week . 
[PER Sheridan  ] said his company was anxious to move forward on having the ban lifted quickly . 
[MISC CAT  ] intended to remove its current dealer and had already begun the process ; once it was completed , he promised to notify al-Hweij. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Post is translating a copy of the relevant law ( [ORG GPC  ] decision number 315 , dated 5/18/2008 ) and will forwarded via email to NEA/MAG . 
Separately , the director for international cooperation at the [ORG GPC  ] for Industry , [ORG Economy and Trade  ] , [PER Dia Hammouda  ] , told Commercial Officer that article 5 of the law addressed the legal issue with [MISC CAT  ] , and that any official who runs a public institution or their relative , including spouses , children , and in-laws , was forbidden from selling goods to that institution . 
[PER Hammouda  ] said that an exclusive agency agreement is not against the law in [LOC Libya  ] , as al-Hweij had implied , but rather , the [ORG GOL  ] prefers that foreign companies assign multiple agents , dealers , or distributors in [LOC Libya  ] . 
[MISC CAT  ] lawyers are also studying the law in order to ensure [MISC CAT  ] is compliant. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Al-Hweij  ] was very engaging and seemed committed to working with [MISC CAT  ] to have the ban lifted . 
However , it remains to be seen whether he has the political clout to make it happen . 
His estimate that approval could be obtained in a week is overly optimistic given how the [MISC Libyan  ] bureaucracy operates . 
[PER Al-Hweij  ] 's arguments that the ban is proscribed by [MISC Libyan  ] law are weak at best after an initial review of the supposed relevant law . 
What is clear is that the [ORG GOL  ] is adamant that [MISC CAT  ] terminate its current dealership arrangement . 
Once it does that , the ban will hopefully be lifted , allowing for equipment already in the pipeline to reach end-users . 
The next step will be for [MISC CAT  ] to find new agents in [LOC Libya  ] , which [MISC CAT  ] has told us it fully intends to do . 
We will continue to work with [MISC CAT  ] and [PER Al-Hweij  ] to try to find a solution to the ban . 
End comment .
