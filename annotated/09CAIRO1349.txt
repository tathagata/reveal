Key Points: -- ( [ORG S/NF  ] ) During a June 29 meeting with [ORG CENTCOM Commander  ] General [PER Petraeus  ] , [MISC Egyptian  ] General [PER Intelligence Service  ] ( EGIS ) Chief [PER Omar Soliman  ] shared his views on [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , and ongoing efforts on [MISC Palestinian  ] reconciliation. -- ( [ORG S/NF  ] ) On [LOC Iraq  ] , [PER Soliman  ] assessed that [MISC Arab  ] leaders were taking a " new position " on supporting [MISC Iraqi  ] Prime Minister [PER Maliki  ] following the [MISC Iranian  ] elections and described [LOC Egypt  ] 's plans to increase cooperation with the [MISC Iraqi  ] government. -- ( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Soliman  ] believed that the [MISC Iranian  ] elections and [ORG Hezbollah  ] 's electoral defeat in [LOC Lebanon  ] presented a " good opportunity " to reduce [MISC Iranian  ] regional interference , including by improving [LOC Syria  ] 's relations with the [MISC Arab  ] world. -- ( [ORG S/NF  ] ) On [MISC Palestinian  ] reconciliation , [PER Soliman  ] was pessimistic that an agreement would be reached , but promised that [LOC Egypt  ] would " not give up " and would continue efforts to undermine [ORG Hamas  ] , including by preventing money and guns from entering [LOC Gaza.  ] ---------------------------- [MISC Iraq: Extending  ] an [MISC Arab  ] Hand ---------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Soliman  ] said [MISC Arab  ] countries were looking for ways to support Prime Minister [PER Maliki  ] during this " crucial time " for [LOC Iraq  ] . 
General [PER Petraeus  ] thanked [LOC Egypt  ] for supporting the [MISC Iraqi  ] government , including by nominating a new Ambassador to [LOC Iraq  ] ( ref A ) and encouraging other [MISC Arab  ] countries to " hold out a hand in friendship . 
" On President [PER Mubarak  ] 's instructions , [PER Soliman  ] explained , [LOC Egypt  ] plans to increase cooperation with [LOC Iraq  ] on a wide variety of political , security , and economic issues. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Soliman  ] assessed that [MISC Arab  ] leaders were taking a " new position " on [LOC Iraq  ] following the [MISC Iranian  ] presidential elections . 
He believed that [MISC Iranian  ] leaders would " change their attitude " towards neighboring countries and " supporting terrorism " abroad , and would focus instead on domestic issues . 
[LOC Iran  ] cannot afford to " challenge the international community now , " [PER Soliman  ] opined . 
The challenge , [PER Soliman  ] explained , was to " bring [LOC Iraq  ] back to the [MISC Arab  ] world " and foster support for [PER Maliki  ] . 
According to [PER Soliman  ] , President [PER Mubarak  ] told King [PER Abdullah  ] of [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] " not to search for another man , " but should instead accept [PER Maliki  ] as [LOC Iraq  ] 's leader and support him. --------------------------------------------- [ORG Iran: Elections Present Opportunity for Arabs  ] --------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Soliman  ] stressed that [LOC Egypt  ] suffers from [MISC Iranian  ] interference , through its [ORG Hezbollah  ] and [ORG Hamas  ] proxies , and its support for [MISC Egyptian  ] groups like [ORG Jamaatt  ] al-Islamiyya and the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] . 
[LOC Egypt  ] will confront the [MISC Iranian  ] threat , he continued , by closely monitoring [MISC Iranian  ] agents in [ORG Hamas  ] , the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] , and any [MISC Egyptian  ] cells . 
Improving relations between [LOC Syria  ] and the [MISC Arab  ] world would also undermine [LOC Iran  ] 's regional influence . 
[PER Soliman  ] noted " a little change " in [LOC Syria  ] 's attitude on engaging with the [MISC Arab  ] world , adding that King [PER Abdullah  ] of [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] shared this view and planned to visit [LOC Damascus  ] soon " to help change [LOC Syria  ] 's attitude . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Soliman  ] anticipated that [ORG Hezbollah  ] 's recent defeat in the [MISC Lebanese  ] parliamentary elections would force the group to " remain quiet for sometime " as they rebuild domestic support and counter the perception that [ORG Hezbollah  ] is a " tool of outsiders . 
" With [LOC Iran  ] itself focusing on domestic issues , he continued , it was a " good time to make changes " in [LOC Lebanon  ] and reduce [LOC Iran  ] 's influence . 
[LOC Egypt  ] will support a [PER Saad Hariri  ] government and the [MISC Lebanese  ] army , [PER Soliman  ] emphasized. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Soliman  ] said that [LOC Iran  ] heeded [LOC Egypt  ] 's warning against meddling in domestic affairs ( ref B ) and supporting groups like the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] . 
He received a " very positive message " from [LOC Iran  ] 's intelligence chief indicating that [LOC Iran  ] would not interfere in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
[LOC Egypt  ] planned to " remain quiet inside [LOC Iran  ] " for the time being , but would continue to recruit agents who " will do what we ask , " if [LOC Iran  ] insists on interfering in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
" We hope [LOC Iran  ] will stop [LOC CAIRO  ] 00001349 002 OF 003 supporting [ORG Hamas  ] , the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] and other cells " within [LOC Egypt  ] [PER Soliman  ] said , " but if not - we are ready . 
" [PER Soliman  ] said [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] wanted to attend the [ORG Non-Aligned Movement  ] ( [ORG NAM  ] ) conference in [LOC Egypt  ] July 11-16 . 
If he did attend , President [PER Mubarak  ] would meet with him and clearly explain that [MISC Iranian  ] interference in " [MISC Arab  ] issues " was unacceptable . 
" We are ready for good relations with [LOC Iran  ] , " [PER Soliman  ] noted , but only if [LOC Iran  ] ceased interfering and supporting terrorists in the region. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Because of domestic problems , [PER Soliman  ] believed that [LOC Iran  ] would seek better relations with the [MISC Arab  ] world and suspend its nuclear program for a period of time to avoid a " war . 
" He also anticipated [LOC Iran  ] would try to strike more of a " balance " between supporting its [ORG Hezbollah  ] and [ORG Hamas  ] " tools " and trying to build better relations with the [MISC Arabs  ] . 
[PER Soliman  ] expressed concern that [MISC Iranian  ] influence in [LOC Iraq  ] would spread after the re-deployment of [LOC U.S.  ] troops out of [MISC Iraqi  ] cities and the eventual drawdown . 
General [PER Petraeus  ] noted that 130,000 [LOC U.S.  ] troops remain and that the drawdown would be gradual . 
He expressed confidence that [MISC Iranian  ] influence could be contained if [MISC Arab  ] countries moved aggressively to support [LOC Iraq.  ] ---------------------------------- [MISC Palestinian  ] Reconciliation , [LOC Israel  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Soliman  ] explained that [LOC Egypt  ] 's three primary objectives with the [MISC Palestinians  ] were to maintain calm in [LOC Gaza  ] , undermine [ORG Hamas  ] , and build popular support for [MISC Palestinian  ] President [PER Mahmoud Abbas  ] . 
On [LOC Gaza  ] , [PER Soliman  ] said [LOC Egypt  ] worked closely with [LOC Israel  ] to coordinate humanitarian assistance shipments and was encouraging the [MISC Israelis  ] to allow more assistance into [LOC Gaza  ] . 
[PER Soliman  ] said he was still seeking a " tahdiya " ( calm ) agreement between [ORG Hamas  ] and [LOC Israel  ] , but noted that [LOC Israel  ] 's lack of a [LOC Gaza  ] strategy and desire to keep [ORG Hamas  ] under pressure made any agreement difficult . 
On undermining [ORG Hamas  ] , [PER Soliman  ] said [LOC Egypt  ] has " stopped " money and arms from entering [LOC Gaza  ] . 
" [ORG Hamas  ] feels they are losing their capabilities , " [PER Soliman  ] said , as they are unable to re-arm using the tunneling network under the [MISC Egypt-Gaza  ] border . 
The pressure , especially from [LOC Egypt  ] 's success at dismantling [ORG Hamas'  ] funding mechanism , may render [ORG Hamas  ] " more flexible " than before. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Palestinians  ] must believe that [PER Abbas  ] is capable of securing a [MISC Palestinian  ] state , [PER Soliman  ] stressed . 
He noted recent positive developments in the [LOC West Bank  ] , including improvements in the [MISC Palestinian  ] security forces and the lifting of some [MISC Israeli  ] roadblocks to facilitate commerce and movement . 
He expressed concern , however , that continued settlement activity , [MISC Israeli  ] Prime Minister [PER Netanyahu  ] 's recent " radical " speech , and insufficient economic development in [MISC Palestinian  ] areas were undermining the chances for resuming peace negotiations . 
[PER Soliman  ] added that President [PER Mubarak  ] may invite [MISC Nentanyahu  ] and [PER Abbas  ] to [LOC Cairo  ] if efforts to re-start negotiations became " blocked . 
" <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Soliman  ] briefed General [PER Petraeus  ] on his efforts to facilitate [MISC Palestinian  ] reconciliation . 
Reconciliation remains elusive , he noted , as neither [ORG Hamas  ] nor [PER Fatah  ] really want an agreement . 
The [MISC Palestinian  ] factions were currently in [LOC Cairo  ] , he said , for discussions on releasing detainees . 
Talks were at an impasse , however , as [ORG Hamas  ] had suspended reconciliation talks until [PER Abbas  ] released all [ORG Hamas  ] detainees in the [LOC West Bank  ] , which [PER Soliman  ] said [PER Abbas  ] would never accept . 
[PER Soliman  ] also doubted that a reconciliation agreement would be reached by July 7 as [LOC Egypt  ] previously announced , and anticipated that talks would be suspended for one-two months . 
Despite the challenge and frustrations , [PER Soliman  ] promised that [LOC Egypt  ] would " not give up " on [MISC Palestinian  ] reconciliation . 
" It is hard , " he continued , " but I am always optimistic . 
I consider myself a patient man , but I am loosing patience . 
" ------------------- [LOC Syria  ] , [LOC Yemen  ] , [LOC Afpak  ] ------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Soliman  ] hoped [LOC Syria  ] would improve its relationship with the [MISC Arab  ] world and the [LOC U.S.  ] and stop serving as " [LOC Iran  ] 's lifeline " in the region . 
He also stressed that [LOC Syria  ] must cooperate with [LOC Iraq  ] to improve border security and stem the flow of foreign fighters . 
[PER Soliman  ] also called on [LOC Syria  ] to drop its insistence that the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] conflict must be solved before [LOC Syria  ] will reach an agreement with [LOC Israel  ] on the [LOC Golan Heights.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Soliman  ] expressed concern over instability in [LOC CAIRO  ] 00001349 003 OF 003 [LOC Yemen  ] and said [LOC Egypt  ] was trying to help President [PER Saleh  ] , including by providing information on [MISC Iranian  ] and [MISC Qatari  ] support to the al-Houthi insurgents . 
General [PER Petraeus  ] noted [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to improve [LOC Yemen  ] 's capacity to combat extremists . 
On [LOC Pakistan  ] , General [PER Petraeus  ] said he was encouraged by the [MISC Pakistani  ] military 's operations in the [LOC Swat Valley  ] and [ORG Northwest Frontier Province  ] , including their focus on holding and rebuilding effected areas . 
[PER Soliman  ] credited the [MISC Pakistani  ] government for doing a better job of convincing people that extremists pose a real threat to [MISC Pakistani  ] national security . 
On [LOC Afghanistan  ] , General [PER Petraeus  ] stressed the importance of arresting the downward spiral of violence and improving governance after the September 20 national elections. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 .
