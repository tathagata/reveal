Z ! eira [PER Mkddozheva  ] was apparently an alias , and the author of the letter was never identified. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) It is possible that the letter was an attempt to " frame " the newspaper , as one day after the letter was published , police raided " [MISC De Fakto  ] , " confiscated computers and documents , and sealed the offices . 
Officials accused [ORG Editor-in-Chief  ] [PER Cholpon Orozobekova  ] of " deliberately providing false statements , " a criminal charge normally reserved for those who provide false statements to law enforcement officials and is punishable by up to 5 years imprisonment . 
[PER Orozobekova  ] 's bank accounts and assets were frozen . 
Government officials and organizations also filed defamation claims against " [PER De Fakto  ] " and won awards of 4 million soms ( over $112,000 ) . 
[PER Orozobekova  ] has since gone into hiding , unable to pay the 5 million soms she owes and fearing criminal prosecution. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) " [PER Alibi  ] " newspaper took a different tack , agreeing to pay the one million soms compensation to Saliyev and printing a retraction . 
It only asked the court for some time to come up with the money and to make payments in installations . 
Nonetheless , on August 22 , police seized the whole press run of the paper " under legal process . 
" Prosecutors went one step further , filing a criminal case for " malicious non-fulfillment of a court decision " against [ORG Editor-in-Chief Babyrbek  ] [PER Djeenbekov  ] . 
On August 29 , in an attempt to avoid paying the fine , [PER Djeenbekov  ] closed down [PER Alibi  ] and published the final issue , which announced the establishment of a new newspaper , " [MISC Achyk Sayasat  ] " ( " [MISC Open Politics  ] " ) . 
On September 10 , [PER Djeenbekov  ] was arrested for failing to comply with a court verdict but was released the following day . 
( Comment: In [LOC Kyrgyzstan  ] , newspapers can avoid paying libel damages by ceasing operations and reopening under a different legal name .

( [ORG SBU  ] ) On July 29 , a court hearing was held to rule on a claim against monthly human rights bulletin " [MISC Prava Dlja Vseh  ] " ( " Rights for Everyone " ) . 
Manager of the [MISC South Kyrgyz Cement Factory  ] and former [ORG Minister of Industry  ] , [PER Yan Fisher  ] , filed a civil suit against " [MISC Prava Dlja Vseh  ] " because the bulletin published an article that was critical of [MISC South Kyrgyz Cement  ] 's hiring practices . 
Mr. [PER Fisher  ] asked the court to press criminal charges against the publication , to fine it 1 million soms , and to close it down . 
After human rights activists intervened , the parties came to an amicable agreement. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On August 26 , [LOC Osh  ] city Vice-Mayor [PER Ainura Shayimkulova  ] filed a defamation case against " [PER Jany Zaman  ] " newspaper , requesting 1 million soms compensation for insulting her honor and dignity .
