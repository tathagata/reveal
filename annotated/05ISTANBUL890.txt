( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Summary: After  ] briefly basking in the reflected glow of last week 's exciting [ORG UEFA Champion  ] 's [ORG League Final  ] in [LOC Istanbul  ] between [LOC Milan  ] and [ORG Liverpool  ] , corporate sponsor [ORG Mastercard  ] has found itself dealing with a public relations nightmare in recent days following public criticism of inclusion in its match city guide of critical commentary about both [LOC Turkey  ] and its revered founder , [ORG Mustafa Kemal Ataturk  ] . 
The offending passages , first publicized in the liberal [MISC Islamist  ] daily " [PER Zaman  ] , " addressed the issue of [MISC Turkish-Kurdish  ] relations and the [MISC Armenian  ] tragedy of 1915 . 
[ORG Mastercard  ] briefly closed its office following death threats against its General Manager , and has since officially apologized , noting that the offending material had not been reviewed by any company officials , but instead emanated from the " [ORG Lonely Planet  ] , " which produced the bulk of the publication . 
The public reaction , which has also included calls for a boycott of the company by [MISC Turkish  ] [ORG NGO  ] 's and the threat of public prosecution from the [LOC Istanbul  ] Governor , highlights once again how close to the surface core nationalist reflexes and taboos are in the post-December 17th environment . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Shortlived Honeymoon: [ORG Mastercard  ] officials , whose biggest problem last week was the deluge of calls they were receiving seeking tickets to the May 25th Milan-Liverpool match , faced a more serious crisis on May 30 when " [PER Zaman  ] " newspaper published extracts from the city guide the company distributed to its VIP guests and journalists . 
In the " [ORG Lonely Planet  ] " produced publication , which was written by an Istanbul-based [MISC British  ] journalist , brief reference was made to the issue of minorities in [LOC Turkey  ] , with sections covering both the [MISC Kurds  ] and the [MISC Armenians  ] . 
The breezy narrative noted that " [ORG Ataturk  ] banned any expression of [MISC Kurdishness  ] in an attempt at assimilation , " adding that major battles and atrocities followed in the 1920s and 1930s , with the deaths of more than 30,000 coming since 1984 . 
On the equally sensitive [MISC Armenian  ] issue , the guide noted that while most [MISC Armenians  ] had remained loyal to the [LOC Ottoman Empire  ] , some had rebelled , engaging in terrorism that set off a powerful anti-Armenian backlash and the " widespread massacre of innocent [MISC Armenians  ] in [LOC Istanbul  ] and elsewhere . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Harsh Reaction: The publication sparked harsh reaction from most quarters , with [LOC Istanbul  ] Governor [LOC Guler  ] denouncing the " insult " to [LOC Turkey  ] and warning that " such a sponsorship firm needs to be more cautious . 
" He added that officials would investigate the publication and determine if it constituted a criminal offense . 
[ORG NGO  ] 's were also quick to leap on the bandwagon , with the [ORG Consumers' Union  ] calling for a boycott of the company if it did not officially apologize . 
[MISC Turkish  ] sports officials also expressed disappointment with the publication . 
More worryingly , anonymous callers phoned in death threats , and nationalist groups indicated that they would organize protests , resulting in closure of [ORG Mastercard  ] 's office early this week and the provision of extra security for General Manager [PER Ozlem Imece.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Damage Control: Since the story broke on May 30 , [ORG Mastercard  ] has been engaged in damage control . 
In an initial announcement on May 30 , the company admitted its mistake and noted it had contacted the " [ORG Lonely Planet  ] " to demand the removal of " erroneous information " from the guide . 
When this did not quell the furor , the company went further a day later and officially apologized . 
In a public statement , General Manager Imece observed that she had not known of some of the material that was to be included in the publication , and was " deeply shocked " by it . 
Privately she has told us that the company was blind-sided by the furor , having been focused on security for their VIP guests last week . 
This , she said , was something that " no one expected . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Comment: Given the sensitivities that exist here , inclusion of any material on topics such as [LOC Turkey  ] 's minority policy or the [MISC Armenian  ] tragedy in a sporting guide was in retrospect a serious mistake . 
The harsh , instinctive reaction , however , shows the heightened sensitivities and hair-trigger nature of public discourse here since the December 17th EU decision . 
Post [ORG RSO  ] has reached out to [ORG Mastercard  ] , which is an active member of the [ORG OSAC Advisory Council  ] , to ensure that they are satisfied with the police response they have received and to provide assistance if needed . 
End Comment .
