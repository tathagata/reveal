( C ) SUMMARY: The [MISC Dutch  ] are deeply committed to the [ORG Transatlantic Dialogue  ] , a successful [ORG EU  ] Presidency , and leadership during the [ORG UN Gene Assembly  ] that values [ORG USG  ] input if not always agreeing with it . 
In discussions with DRL PDAS [PER Kozak  ] and IO DAS Lagon on July12 - 13 , [MISC Dutch  ] interlocutors acknowledged [MISC Chinese  ] backsliding on human rights in the l six months but did not expect this to influence [ORG EU  ] thinking on lifting [LOC China  ] Arms Embargo . 
[MISC Dutch  ] [ORG MFA  ] and [ORG NGO  ] officials remain terribly troubled by [LOC Abu Ghraib  ] and welcomed [ORG USG  ] clarification regarding the status of [LOC Guantanamo  ] prisoners . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] agreed to collaborate on a [MISC US-EU  ] package of agreed language to settle references to contentious issues in [ORG Third Committee  ] resolutions . 
[PER USDel  ] signaled new flexibility [ORG UN Commission  ] on [ORG Human Rights  ] elections , prompting the [MISC Dutch  ] to agree t restart WEOG negotiations . 
[LOC Sudan  ] , [LOC Chechnya  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Burma  ] , [LOC Turkmenistan  ] , and [LOC Zimbabwe  ] seem likely subjects for [ORG Third Committee  ] resolutions , whil [LOC Belarus  ] and [LOC Uzbekistan  ] are not . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) [LOC China  ] , [LOC Guantanamo  ] , human rights and a range of [ORG United Nations  ] issues were the agenda in The [ORG Hague  ] , June 12 - 13 , for DRL PDAS [PER Michael Kozak  ] 's and IO DAS [PER Mark Lagon  ] 's meetings with [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG MFA  ] officials . 
[ORG MFA  ] interlocutors included Special Ambassador for [ORG Human Rights Piet de Kler Deputy Political  ] Director [PER Hermann Schaper  ] , [ORG Human Rights  ] Director [PER Adanna Adema  ] , and Director of the [ORG UN Department  ] [PER Karel van Kesteren  ] . 
The [ORG DCM  ] hosted an [ORG NGO  ] reception and [PER Lagon  ] briefed a large group of university students on [ORG U.S. Human Rights  ] concerns and multilateral issues generall [LOC CHINA  ] ARMS EMBARGO AND BACKSLIDING ON [ORG HUMAN RIGHTS  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Amb. [PER de Klerk  ] will travel to [LOC China  ] soon to review the human rig situation . 
[PER Schaper  ] reminded [PER USDel  ] that the [ORG EU  ] 's embargo was a specific response keyed to [LOC Tiananmen Square  ] . 
It was not intended as retaliation for human rights issues generally and was not imposed for military considerations , although both concerns now prompt the [ORG USG  ] push for maintaining the ban . 
He admitted [MISC Chinese  ] backsliding over the last six months caused concern but stressed that this in itself was not a sufficient argument for maintaining the embargo. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [MISC Dutch  ] said that the next senior [ORG EU  ] discussion of [LOC China  ] in September would focus on the last couple of years of [MISC Chinese  ] actions . 
[ORG EU  ] will examine whether their [LOC China  ] dialogue has made a difference on t ground . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] shared elements from the [ORG EU  ] decision matrix: a . 
The [ORG EU  ] does not want the embargo to stand in the way of overall bett relations. b . 
Human rights is but one issue here ; the question is more than is t glass half full or half empty . 
There are more glasses on the table . 
There has been recent backsliding , but overall the situation has improv over the last 15 years . 
The embargo was a response to [LOC Tiananmen Square  ] c . 
The [ORG EU  ] does not expect to export its best weapons to [LOC China  ] should t ban be lifted , and it does not want [MISC European  ] weapons to be used or deployed against [LOC U.S.  ] forces. d . 
What effect would lifting have on the [LOC US  ] presidential elections ; an would it lead to Euro-bashing that would embarrass the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG EU  ] Presidency , for example. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) PDAS [PER Kozak  ] disputed the [MISC Dutch  ] assertions regarding [LOC China  ] 's improved human rights record and shared recent examples of [LOC China  ] 's unfulfilled commitments . 
A dialogue without results was pointless , he stressed . 
Regarding [LOC Tiananmen  ] , [MISC Chinese  ] restraint from running people o with tanks in recent years could not justify lifting . 
He suggested the should take a closer look at the status of those who were punished for [LOC Tiananmen  ] , if resolution of that issue is the threshold for lifting. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER USDel  ] and [ORG NGO  ] reps , meeting later at the [ORG DCM  ] 's residence , brainstormed ideas for trying to use public opinion to deflect what loo like a pending [ORG EU  ] decision to lift the ban . 
One idea that resonated wa to hold a [MISC European  ] [ORG NGO  ] forum on the [MISC Chinese  ] human rights situation earl in the fall . 
GUANTANAMO AND OTHER DETAINEES IN THE WAR ON TERROR <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG MFA  ] officials and [ORG NGO  ] reps remained terribly troubled b what happened at [LOC Abu Ghraib  ] and were clearly hungry for the latest information on the status of all detainees ( ref b ) . 
Discussions of the new [LOC Cuba  ] resolution in [LOC ECOSOC  ] ( ref b ) led to thinking about how to a discussion of how improve [MISC Dutch  ] and [ORG EU  ] public opinion , including development of new public affairs products or informal visits to [LOC Guantanamo  ] by an [ORG EU  ] or [ORG EU  ] Presidency rep . 
[PER USDel  ] did not commit to thes proposals but promised to study options . 
THE [ORG UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) [ORG UN Priorities  ] for 59 [ORG UNGA  ] The [ORG USG  ] 's [ORG UNGA  ] priorities paper has inspired the [ORG EU  ] to devise a concise working paper of their own , the [MISC Dutch  ] told us . 
They promised to study [ORG UNGA  ] priorities ( septel ) and offered to review the [ORG EU  ] list with us late in the week as well ( septel ) . <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Working together at the [ORG UNGA  ] - [ORG Third Committee  ] [PER USDel  ] committed to sending the [ORG EU  ] a draft package of agreed language to settle references in resolutions to contentious issues in the [ORG Third Committee  ] , including how to refer to the [ORG International Criminal Court  ] , death penalty , and the Convention on the Rights of the Child , among others . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] agreed to vet our draft at the [ORG EU  ] 's September COHUM ( working group on human rights ) and to arrange a bilateral meeting , if needed , to work out problems . 
This might be in [LOC Brussels  ] on or about October 1 , or in [LOC Warsaw  ] around the same time. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Country specific issues included: - [PER Sudan: We  ] agreed to wait to see what the [ORG Security Council  ] would do before considering [ORG Third Committee  ] action to follow on the [ORG UNCHR  ] resolution . 
( [LOC Sudan  ] is discussed in more detail below ) . - [PER Burma: We  ] agreed there is a need to have [ORG Third Committee  ] action. - [ORG Turkmenistan:  ] The [ORG EU  ] wondered if it made sense to table another resolution this year . 
Not doing so might send the wrong signal . 
On th other hand , we are trying to streamline the [ORG UN  ] agenda . 
The [ORG EU  ] suggeste we could run one last resolution and announce that henceforth we would focus on action in the [LOC UNCHR.  ] - [PER Zimbabwe: USDel  ] offered to support any [MISC British  ] action in [LOC New York  ] if they want to have a resolution there. - [LOC Belarus  ] and [PER Uzbekistan: We  ] agreed that there is no need for [ORG Third Committee  ] action since rapporteurs have been already been assigned . 
[ORG UN REFORM  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Reformed and better [ORG UN Geopolitical  ] reality and strategic practicality inspire the [LOC Netherlands  ] devotion to the multilateral system with an active , constructive , and reformed [ORG UN  ] at the center , [PER Schaper  ] said . 
The upcoming review of the [ORG Millennium Development Goals  ] is a natural deadline for [ORG UN  ] reforms . 
DAS Lagon assured him that the [LOC US  ] is as committed to building up the [ORG UN  ] as have been to reforming it , however we cannot single-handedly reach the goal of a [ORG UN  ] living up to its original purposes. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The [MISC Dutch  ] do not want [ORG UN  ] reform to stall over [ORG Security Council  ] enlargement . 
They favor , eventually , one [ORG EU  ] seat . 
The [ORG MFA  ] working lev however , opposes [LOC Germany  ] 's [ORG SC  ] seat bid , but publicly the [ORG MFA  ] has had to along for now . 
On voting , the [MISC Dutch  ] have proposed to [LOC SYG Annan  ] a votin weight system as follows: 1/3 based on being a member of the [ORG UN  ] ; 1/3 based on population ; and 1/3 based on the total amount of assessed and voluntary contributions to the [ORG UN.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( U ) Community of [ORG Democracies/Democracy Caucus  ] In courting the wary [MISC Dutch  ] to become involved , we reassured them that t [ORG Democracy Caucus  ] ( [ORG DC  ] ) would augment , not compete , with traditional , long-standing groups . 
Admitting the idea has theoretical merit , the Du remained curious about how the [ORG Caucus  ] would admit borderline members. noted that [ORG UN  ] PermRep [ORG Danforth  ] cited the [ORG DC  ] in his confirmation hearing and thought it a useful tool not limited to use in human rights but als good for development issues , [ORG UN  ] reform , and so on . 
[ORG UN  ] COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND ACTION FOR COUNTRY SPECIFIC CONCERNS <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [ORG UNCHR  ] Elections We signaled [LOC U.S.  ] readiness to restart negotiations over an agreed WEOG slate for [ORG UNCHR  ] elections , with new flexibility on forgoing membership two years , rather than one , out of 21 . 
[PER Van Kesteren  ] , co-chair ( with th [MISC Canadians  ] ) of earlier negotiations on this issue , agreed to explore restarting negotiations based on this welcome information . 
He added th the [LOC U.S.  ] might end up having to relinquish three years to get a deal. added that , after the [ORG Security Council  ] , membership on the [ORG UNCHR  ] was a valuable prize for many states . 
DAS Lagon reported the [MISC French  ] seemed prepared to work it out so WEOG could focus on substance and discourage the current practice of vote trading with undesirable countries from ot regions . 
Finally , van [PER Kesteren  ] fingered [LOC Austria  ] as a problem country t insisted on maintaining their position based on the established pattern Commission membership. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [LOC Sudan  ] The [MISC Dutch  ] felt the time was ripe for a [ORG SC  ] resolution on [LOC Sudan  ] . 
There w serious problems with both sides and sanctions might be appropriate . 
I reviewing the earlier , troublesome [LOC Geneva  ] negotiations on the [LOC Sudan  ] resolution and what to do in the [ORG Third Committee  ] , the [MISC Dutch  ] predicted [LOC N York  ] discussions would again be a triangle between the [LOC U.S.  ] , [ORG EU  ] and [ORG African Union  ] ( [ORG AU  ] ) . 
[PER USDel  ] urged the [ORG EU  ] to avoid surprises like the dea it cut with the [ORG AU  ] behind our backs on the last day of talks in [LOC Geneva  ] . 
We agreed it would be useful to try to split the [ORG AU  ] members by peeling [LOC South Africa  ] and other [ORG AU  ] members chafing under the [ORG AU  ] 's lowest common denominator protection of [LOC Sudan  ] . 
There was consensus not to let discussion of the genocide question delay or thwart more immediate action. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG NGOs  ] suggested that finding a political solution should be m higher on the agenda . 
The rep from Doctors Without Borders complained that the [ORG NGOs  ] are under new threats because both government and rebels object to their perceived sharing of information from the field with th outside world . 
[PER PDAS Kozak  ] regretted that information sharing caused problems , and said it is important for the [ORG GOS  ] to know we are collectin facts so as to hold them accountable. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Chechnya  ] [ORG NGOs  ] believed the international community has increasingly abandoned [LOC Chechnya  ] and that the situation has become more criminalized in the las four years . 
[MISC Dutch  ] [ORG MFA  ] officials had earlier admitted that the [ORG EU  ] has a bloody nose on this intractable issue . 
[PER PDAS Kozak  ] reassured [ORG NGOs  ] tha we raise [LOC Chechnya  ] with the [MISC Russians  ] all the time and have not let terrorism get in the way of promoting human rights. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [LOC Iran  ] The [MISC Dutch  ] reported a meeting the [ORG EU  ] had in [LOC Teheran  ] three weeks ago wher academics and officials discussed police , prisons , and the legal system Discussions were much more uni sono than half a year ago since opposition parliamentarians were absent . 
There are serious questions n whether to continue the dialogue and there will be a decision by early October , they told us . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] reminded [PER USDel  ] that they see the non-proliferation issue as part of a broader relationship with [LOC Iran  ] tha includes expanding business opportunities . 
MEETING WITH UNIVERSITY STUDENTS <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( U ) DAS Lagon had a cordial dialogue with 25 student leaders from [MISC Dutch  ] universities who asked about the [LOC U.S  ] . 
's lack of participation wit the [ORG ICC  ] , its support of [LOC Israel  ] in the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] conflict , its perceived unilateral approach to the war in [LOC Iraq  ] , and its treatment of human rights in the broader war on terrorism . 
Praising the [ORG EU  ] 's cultur of dialogue as a model for other nations , [PER Lagon  ] cautioned that [MISC American  ] realpolitik is a reaction to a belief that the rest of the world has a less mature approach to international relations . 
[PER Lagon  ] warned that tha an extended process of seeking consensus often delayed urgent action . 
Rejecting allegations of [LOC U.S.  ] unilateralism , [PER Lagon  ] described [LOC America  ] 's involvement in many multilateral efforts . 
Public diplomacy could rever impressions of [MISC American  ] unilateralism and build greater consensus for U actions . 
He suggested exchange programs , greater awareness by [MISC American  ] politicians of their global audiences , and discussions such as the one was currently having were important elements in such a strategy . 
COMMENT <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) Commitment to the [ORG Transatlantic Dialogue  ] underlies much of the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG UN  ] agenda during their [ORG EU  ] Presidency . 
Their exchanges with the [PER USDel  ] were productive , showed flexibility and receptiveness to [LOC US  ] ideas and a drive to find consensus while doing their duty for national and E positions . 
Their promise to work more closely on the [LOC Sudan  ] human right resolutions in [LOC New York  ] was welcome and signaled good intentions on the wider range of issues . 
On the other hand , their narrowing of the [LOC China  ] arms embargo debate to [LOC Tiananmen Square  ] left us little room to argue th larger human rights and military points of the issue . 
Immediately on [LOC Guantanamo  ] and longer term in general , the [MISC Dutch  ] public remains recepti to fresh public diplomacy efforts providing information they can use to justify alignment with [LOC U.S.  ] positions .
