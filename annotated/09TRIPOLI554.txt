[PER Carson  ] charged the Government of [LOC Eritrea  ] ( [ORG GSE  ] ) with providing financial and logistical assistance to al-Shabaab , playing a spoiler role in [LOC Somalia  ] , and using [LOC Somalia  ] as a battlefield for its proxy war with [LOC Ethiopia  ] . 
He said the [LOC United States  ] is reaching out to [LOC Eritrea  ] , but warned [LOC Eritrea  ] 's top officials that [ORG GSE  ] 's current path will lead to further international isolation and possible sanctions . 
[PER Yemane  ] denied providing assistance to al-Shabaab and claimed their issues with [LOC Ethiopia  ] are separate from the situation in [LOC Somalia  ] . 
End Summary . 
RESPONSE TO GSE'S ONGOING DENIALS --------------------------------- 2 . 
( C ) [PER A/S Carson  ] opened the meeting by expressing [ORG USG  ] 's desire to improve the bilateral relationship with the [ORG GSE  ] and urged [LOC Eritrea  ] to stop immediately from playing a spoiler role in [LOC Somalia  ] by proving financial and logistical assistance to al-Shabaab . 
3 . 
( C ) [PER Yemane  ] welcomed [PER Carson  ] 's offer for a renewed relationship and said it is long overdue . 
He then firmly denied providing support to al-Shabaab and said the [ORG GSE  ] is playing a constructive role in [LOC Somalia  ] . 
In response , [PER A/S Carson  ] stated , " We categorically reject that you are innocent and believe you are the supplier of resources going into the hands of al-Shabaab . 
" He directly linked [LOC Eritrea  ] to al-Shabaab 's success in [LOC Somalia  ] , and called on [LOC Eritrea  ] to cease supporting violent extremists , not only in perception but in reality , if a reinvigorated and positive bilateral relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] is truly a priority for the [ORG GSE  ] . 
" The choice is yours . 
The only thing we can do is encourage you to do the right thing , " [PER Carson  ] added . 
In response , [PER Yemane  ] and FM [PER Osman Saleh  ] continued [LOC Eritrea  ] 's longstanding denial of [ORG GSE  ] support of al-Shabaab . 
The FM further retorted that linking [LOC Eritrea  ] to al-Shaabab is unacceptable . 
PROXY WAR WITH [LOC ETHIOPIA  ] ----------------------- 4 . 
( C ) [PER A/S Carson  ] detailed the [ORG USG  ] position in support of the [MISC Somali  ] [ORG Transitional Federal Government  ] ( [ORG TFG  ] ) and the [LOC Djibouti  ] peace process . 
He noted that the [ORG GSE  ] appears to be supporting al-Shabaab not because [LOC Eritrea  ] is pro-extremist but because it is fighting a proxy war with [LOC Ethiopia  ] . 
The [ORG GSE  ] officials stressed their issues with [LOC Ethiopia  ] are separate from the situation in [LOC Somalia  ] and accused [PER A/S Carson  ] of recycling the same language as [LOC Ethiopia  ] by referring to [LOC Eritrea  ] as a spoiler . 
[ORG GSE  ] 's POSITION ON [LOC SOMALIA  ] ------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>Â¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Yemane  ] defined the [ORG GSE  ] 's objective as creating a strong , unified [MISC Somali  ] state , then faulted [LOC Ethiopia  ] for dividing [LOC Somalia  ] . 
[PER Yemane  ] insisted the only way forward was to establish an all-inclusive ( including [LOC Somaliland  ] and [LOC Puntland  ] ) , Somali-driven dialogue supported by the international community . 
He asserted that all other methods have failed . 
[PER Yemane  ] criticized the [LOC Djibouti  ] talks for not allowing other [MISC Somali  ] political players to accompany [ORG TFG  ] President [PER Sheikh Sharif  ] to the meetings . 
By lending its support to [PER Sheikh Sharif  ] , he claimed the international community was sending the wrong message . 
This message , he stated , encouraged [PER Sheikh Sharif  ] to pursue a military option rather than negotiate with opposition . 
[PER Yemane  ] called [ORG AMISOM  ] a " weak peacekeeping force " that will not succeed without the support of all protagonists in [LOC Somalia  ] . 
[PER A/S Carson  ] rejected [PER Yemane  ] 's analysis , accused the [MISC Eritreans  ] of not supporting a more inclusive [MISC Somali  ] process and challenged the [ORG GSE  ] to help build an all-inclusive dialogue within the [ORG TFG  ] framework . 
[ORG US DIALOGUE ATTEMPTS REBUFFED  ] BY [ORG GSE  ] ------------------------------------ [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000554 002.2 OF 002 6 . 
( C ) When [PER Yemane  ] expressed [ORG GSE  ] 's interest in sending a delegation to the [LOC U.S.  ] to discuss bilateral relations , [PER A/S Carson  ] pointed out that recent [ORG USG  ] attempts to engage [LOC Eritrea  ] were rebuffed by the [ORG GSE  ] . 
Secretary [PER Clinton  ] 's effort to reach out to [MISC Eritrean  ] President [PER Isaias Afwerki  ] in a June telephone call was met with no response from [MISC Isaias'  ] office and the [MISC Eritrean  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Washington  ] refused to issue [PER A/S Carson  ] a visa for his proposed trip to [LOC Asmara  ] to meet with [PER Isaias  ] , [PER Carson  ] continued . 
[PER Yemane  ] denied that [PER A/S Carson  ] 's visa had been rejected , claiming instead that it was only " not yet approved . 
" [PER Yemane  ] said before such a call by the Secretary or visit by [PER Carson  ] could take place , the [ORG GSE  ] believes that working level meetings must occur to discuss [LOC Somalia  ] and lay the groundwork for an improved bilateral relationship . 
7 . 
( C ) [PER Carson  ] closed the meeting by encouraging the [ORG GSE  ] to speak out against al-Shabaab , end its support for [MISC Somali  ] extremists and move forward with constructive actions . 
[PER Yemane  ] replied , " We will be constructive . 
Regardless of our relationship with the [LOC United States  ] , [LOC Somalia  ] is very important to us and we will work toward a peaceful solution . 
" 8 . 
( U ) [PER A/S Carson  ] has approved this message .
