( [ORG S  ] ) As the review of [LOC U.S.  ] policy regarding [LOC Burma  ] continues amid signs that the military regime wants to engage with [LOC Washington  ] , we offer some thoughts about the senior generals , what motivates them , what they might want from engagement , and what the [LOC U.S.  ] might place on the table . 
[LOC Burma  ] 's military machine is top-down , xenophobic and utterly focused on preserving national unity . 
At the same time , senior generals are embarrassed by their international pariah status and crave respect . 
Some are concerned with [LOC Burma  ] 's ever-growing dependence on [LOC China  ] and its geostrategic location amidst historical foes . 
Others , having seen a glimpse of the international community 's benevolence following [PER Nargis  ] , no doubt wish for a lifting of sanctions and economic assistance . 
No matter the motivations , a dialogue with [LOC Burma  ] 's senior military leaders will be slow , frustrating , and , within the [LOC U.S.  ] , politically charged . 
While dialogue is unlikely to yield major , near-term political outcomes such as changes to the constitution , it might sow seeds for future change by illustrating to the next line of leaders what an improved relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] could look like . 
Above all , a dialogue could lead to tangible benefits for [LOC Burma  ] 's long-suffering people , a worthwhile goal in itself . 
End summary . 
How do they think ? ------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) All major decisions in [LOC Burma  ] are made at the very top . 
Senior general [PER Than Shwe  ] , Vice Senior General [PER Maung Aye  ] , and their inner circles call the shots . 
[PER Than Shwe  ] 's dominant personality is keenly felt . 
Subordinates appear to share only good news , leaving the senior generals potentially ignorant of many realities . 
In this information vacuum , the generals continue to pursue their " roadmap to democracy " and ruinous , top-down economic policies . 
While self interest clearly is a factor in their thinking , it would be a mistake to think they are motivated exclusively by self-enrichment . 
These are true believers who are convinced they are divinely entrusted in the tradition of the [MISC Burmese  ] " warrior kings " with doing what is best for the country and the people . 
They feel they are simply misunderstood by the outside world. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) These are career military men , most with combat experience in [LOC Burma  ] 's past internal conflicts , who value the unity and stability of the state as a top priority . 
The senior generals assert , and seem genuinely to believe , that the military is the only guarantor of that unity and stability . 
Thus , they see a dominant role for the armed forces in governance to be essential . 
The senior generals inculcate this military ethos , indoctrinating new cadets to be " the triumphant elite of the future . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Since only very senior career military men make real decisions , such men would need to participate in any serious engagement effort with the civilian-led [LOC U.S.  ] The [MISC Burmese  ] military would be far more comfortable at the table in a mil/mil environment , their comfort zone. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The generals see themselves as devout Buddhists . 
State media have recently inundated the public with scenes of senior generals and their families consecrating the newly-constructed [PER Uppatasanti Pagoda  ] in [LOC Nay Pyi  ] Taw , a replica of [LOC Rangoon  ] 's legendary [PER Shwedagon Pagoda  ] . 
Of course , such acts of Buddhist merit-making have a public relations aspect , but they also do reflect a philosophical base. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Families matter . 
The senior generals spoil their children and grandchildren . 
They seek to protect their families--some were sent to [LOC Dubai  ] in September 2007 to ride out the [PER Saffron Revolution  ] protests and crackdown . 
The generals also seek to ensure a firm financial footing for their families' futures through lucrative positions at home and bank accounts offshore . 
The application of our visa bans against the generals' immediate family members irritates. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [MISC Western  ] rationality is not always apparent in regime decision-making . 
[PER Than Shwe  ] reportedly relies on favored soothsayers . 
We hear one such seer advised moving the capital to the interior because [LOC Rangoon  ] would be subject to street disturbances and a horrific storm . 
Numerology also factors in . 
Witness the overnight shift to a currency divisible by nines in 1987 and the release of 9,002 prisoners last September , reportedly to ensure an auspicious 2009 . 
Such decision methods may sound strange to us , but they are everyday elements in the lives of many [MISC Burmese.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The senior generals are xenophobic . 
They don't seem to understand foreigners and certainly don't trust them , particularly those who challenge their legitimacy . 
This may be a reason why [PER Than Shwe  ] reportedly abhors [PER Aung San Suu Kyi  ] , who grew up overseas , married a [LOC UK  ] citizen and then returned to [LOC Burma  ] to challenge the military 's authority . 
Historically , the [MISC Burmese  ] have fought wars with all their neighbors , including [LOC China  ] , [LOC India  ] , and [LOC Thailand  ] . 
While the current regime relies heavily on [LOC China  ] for investment , trade and support in international institutions and accepts a degree of [MISC Chinese  ] advice as a consequence , it is very unlikely that the senior generals would defer to [MISC Chinese  ] ( or any outsider 's ) demands on core issues , particularly on the military 's central role in governance. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The generals are paranoid about the [LOC U.S.  ] , fear invasion , and have a bunker mentality . 
Past [LOC U.S.  ] rhetoric about regime change sharpened concerns . 
One rumored explanation for [PER Than Shwe  ] 's decision to move the capital to [LOC Nay Pyi  ] Taw , far from the coast , was supposedly to protect from a sea-borne invasion force . 
The regime was truly convinced the [LOC U.S.  ] was prepared to invade when a helicopter carrier sailed near [MISC Burmese  ] territorial waters for humanitarian purposes after Cyclone [PER Nargis  ] last May. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Than Shwe  ] and his colleagues view the current period as one chapter in [LOC Burma  ] 's long history . 
They profess that democracy requires a guided process of " gradual maturity . 
" They believe the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [LOC West  ] in general are trying to force democracy on a country that is not yet developed enough to handle it . 
This is more than a cynical excuse to retain power . 
They think they know best. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) At the same time , the generals are proud and crave the acceptance of the international community . 
They hate being subject to sanctions and aspire to be treated with the respect accorded other world leaders , including some authoritarian ones . 
Interactions with key foreign visitors and [MISC Burmese  ] attendance at international fora always make headlines in the government newspaper . 
Why might the regime want to talk now ? -------------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Indications are that the senior generals are hoping for a fresh [ORG USG  ] approach and are willing to explore engagement . 
Even before the [LOC U.S.  ] elections , the generals were testing the waters . 
Last August , they suggested a senior [LOC U.S.  ] military official should visit [LOC Burma  ] . 
More recently , they have made clear they want conversations in [LOC Washington  ] and have asked to upgrade from Charge d'Affaires to Ambassador for that purpose . 
They recently suggested narcotics and POW/MIA issues might be useful topics for initial discussion . 
They provided unusually high access when EAP/MLS Director [PER Blake  ] visited [LOC Burma  ] last week . 
What motivates the desire to talk ? <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) When the [LOC U.S.  ] response to Cyclone [PER Nargis  ] last May was a major humanitarian effort rather than a much-feared invasion , the generals were reportedly surprised and gratified . 
More broadly , some senior leaders have drawn a lesson from the [PER Nargis  ] response that international humanitarian assistance can be valuable . 
Some in the military are nervous about an overdependence on [LOC China  ] ; all recall the difficult history with that looming neighbor . 
President [PER Obama  ] 's engagement theme intrigues . 
The generals want the international respect that a more normal relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] would bring . 
They feel a degree of pain , or at least irritation , from sanctions , and want relief . 
It may be that some neighbors , [ORG ASEAN  ] leaders , maybe even the [MISC Chinese  ] , are urging the generals to try dialogue. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Also , it is entirely possible that the most senior generals are looking for an escape strategy . 
Retirement has never been an option for [MISC Burmese  ] leaders . 
Historically , [MISC Burmese  ] kings or generals and those close to them either have died in office , been killed , or been deposed and imprisoned . 
The current senior generals are getting old , but they have no desire to be held to account for what the outside world perceives as their crimes against the people . 
[PER Than Shwe  ] reportedly has mentioned to some interlocutors , including [MISC Indonesian  ] President [PER Yudoyono  ] , his strong desire not to appear before an international tribunal . 
All the top generals undoubtedly want assurances that , if they voluntarily step aside , they and their families will retain their assets and will not be prosecuted . 
What might the regime propose ? ------------------------------ <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Senior generals likely perceive that they have already made concessions . 
They allow foreign embassies and cultural units like the [ORG American Center  ] to operate . 
They have received high-level [ORG UN  ] visits , including four thus far in 2009 . 
They have committed to a " roadmap to democracy , " drafted a constitution , held a referendum , and announced elections . 
They have released some political prisoners , including several high-profile ones like [PER Win Tin  ] , though not yet [PER Aung San Suu Kyi.  ] <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) We should not expect significant progress on political core issues in the near term . 
The regime is very unlikely to reverse course on its " democracy " roadmap , to rehash the 1990 elections or to revisit the new constitution . 
The senior generals will not leave the scene willingly unless they are confident of their own safety and of financial security for themselves and their families. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Some possible offers: --The regime might accept some tweaks to the election process ; a degree of international observation is reportedly already on offer. --They might relax some terms of [ORG ASSK  ] 's current detention. --They could possibly be persuaded to release some political prisoners in advance of the elections . 
At a minimum , they might consider resumption of [ORG ICRC  ] access to political prisoners. --The regime would likely seek cooperation on perceived win/win issues like counter-narcotics , counter-terrorism , anti-trafficking , economic-policy advice , and disaster-risk reduction . 
They likely would relish mil/mil and law enforcement training opportunities. --There also may be willingness to make concessions on lower-profile issues that affect the operation of our Embassy , such as visas , increased in-country travel permission , and an expansion of our presence to include a re-opening of the former [LOC U.S.  ] consulate in [LOC Mandalay  ] and/or a USAID mission to oversee humanitarian assistance. --Symbolic gestures carry much weight with the [MISC Burmese  ] . 
The regime has already signaled it wants to upgrade its [ORG COM  ] in [LOC Washington  ] from Charge to Ambassador . 
It aspires for the [LOC U.S.  ] to use the country name " [LOC Myanmar  ] , " not " [LOC Burma  ] . 
" If the [LOC U.S.  ] engages , what might we raise and offer ? --------------------------------------------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Any engagement effort would likely take time , not just one meeting or two , but a series of encounters that , ideally , would gradually build confidence and a willingness on the [MISC Burmese  ] side to open up . 
That is the " [MISC Asian  ] way . 
" In the early stages , it would be useful to dispel any regime concern that the [LOC U.S.  ] intends to invade or dominate . 
We should hint that [LOC Burma  ] stands to gain from decent relationships with the outside world and that there are alternatives to reliance on [LOC China  ] . 
When leaders change their ways they can have a fruitful relationship with the [LOC United States  ] based on shared mutual interests . 
-- Still , it would be important up front to reiterate key , long-term themes: the need to release political prisoners , including [ORG ASSK  ] , and initiate genuine dialogue . 
-- Early on , we should accent shared mutual interests , such as the win/win topics mentioned above: counter-narcotics ; trafficking in persons ; disaster risk reduction ; and remains recovery from [LOC WWII  ] , with a note that [MISC U.S.-facilitated  ] training in such areas could be possible . 
-- The effects of the worldwide economic recession offer opportunities . 
[LOC Burma  ] 's economy is suffering . 
Positive political steps from the regime side could lead to an easing of broad-based economic sanctions , spurring growth and diversification in [LOC Burma  ] 's economy . 
We could dangle [ORG World Bank  ] and [ORG IMF  ] technical assistance and , with progress , loan packages . 
We could consider revisiting current restrictions on the ability of [ORG UNDP  ] to work with low-level GOB entities . 
With sufficient progress , the sanctions specifically targeted at the regime and its cronies could be on offer , too . 
-- We should make clear our desire to provide increased humanitarian assistance ( outside of regime channels ) to help meet crying needs . 
Unstated but true: such aid would subvert the regime both by building civil-society capacity and illustrating to the grassroots in [LOC Burma  ] that the outside world helps and the regime doesn't . 
We should seek regime cooperation on the [LOC Rohingya  ] issue , offering USG assistance to build livelihood opportunities in [LOC Northern Rakine State  ] . 
-- We could formally open a [ORG PD  ] outreach center in [LOC Mandalay  ] , utilizing the [LOC U.S.  ] consulate that closed in 1980 . 
Countrywide , we could offer increased educational exchanges . 
Those who studied in the [LOC U.S.  ] even many years ago retain fond memories and view the [LOC U.S.  ] in a positive light . 
Access to quality education is priority one for [LOC Burma  ] 's citizens . 
-- We could consider accepting the country name " [LOC Myanmar  ] . 
" " [LOC Burma  ] " is a vestige of colonial times that actually elevates the [MISC Bamar  ] majority over other ethnic groups . 
Practically everyone inside uses the term [LOC Myanmar  ] , as do all countries in [LOC Southeast Asia  ] , though the [ORG NLD  ] has thus far refused to bend on that topic . 
-- We could accede to the regime request to upgrade their [ORG COM  ] in [LOC Washington  ] from [LOC CDA  ] to Ambassador . 
Comment ------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Some propose that getting started at a better relationship is more important than insisting on difficult-to-achieve democracy and human-rights outcomes in the near term . 
In that view , [LOC U.S.  ] regional and global interests should drive [LOC Burma  ] policy . 
Others remain adamant that to demand less than the right democratic and human-rights outcomes would be to sacrifice the efforts of Nobel-laureate [PER Aung San Suu Kyi  ] and others in a wishful expediency . 
Any walk down the road of dialogue will require great patience and thoughtful judgments about how much to offer and how much to demand . 
The regime 's inclination toward engagement is surely driven by its own perceived interests ( reducing sanctions , achieving respect , modulating [LOC China  ] 's influence ) . 
However , the senior generals likely see rapid movement to the West 's democracy and human-rights goals as downright dangerous . 
Still , one never knows how flexible the other side will be until negotiations begin . 
Also , the looming 2010 elections may be an opportunity . 
The process will be flawed , but an aspect may be stage one of a transition toward a next set of ( mostly military ) leaders . 
[MISC U.S.-Burmese  ] dialogue now could signal to that next generation what a positive relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] might offer , planting seeds for future change. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Given the likelihood that major successes on the democracy front will be slow in coming , we believe it important for the [LOC U.S.  ] to undertake a long-term effort to build the groundwork for future democracy . 
Per our [ORG MSP  ] , we want to follow up on post-cyclone aid with a broader humanitarian-assistance endeavor . 
If properly designed , such assistance builds the basic capacity of people at the grassroots to survive and to think beyond mere subsistence to political goals . 
Such aid is subversive more directly as well: recipients understand who helps them ( international donors ) and who doesn't ( the regime ) . 
In this context , " humanitarian " aid can encompass health , non-state education , micro-finance , and other local initiatives , all with civil-society capacity-building components . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] should also focus on elements within the regime that show genuine interest in our regional priorities . 
The units involved in counter-narcotics , anti-trafficking , and infectious-disease efforts would be good places to start . 
They have shown willingness to act appropriately , but they need training . 
Aside from contributing to our regional goals , assisting such elements might encourage some broader re-thinking of regime attitudes toward the [MISC Western  ] world .
