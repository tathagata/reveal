( [ORG U  ] ) Summary: [LOC Iceland  ] 's recently-announced plan to accept 30 [MISC Palestinian  ] refugees has sparked new debate on societal tolerance of immigrants and again revealed deep divisions in the [ORG Liberal Party  ] . 
Meanwhile , the town of [LOC Akranes  ] , just outside [LOC Reykjavik  ] , is poised to accept the refugees despite a loosely-organized petition drive opposing the plan . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) On May 6 , the [ORG Icelandic Government  ] approved a proposal by the [ORG Icelandic Refugee Council  ] to offer asylum to up to 30 [MISC Palestinian  ] refugees in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
The refugees would fulfill [LOC Iceland  ] 's [ORG UNHCR  ] referral quota of 25-30 refugees a year . 
The group is made up of single mothers and their children currently staying in the [LOC Al Waleed  ] refugee camps close to [LOC Iraq  ] 's border with [LOC Syria  ] . 
As part of its proposal , the [ORG Refugee Council  ] asked the government of the western [LOC Iceland  ] town of [LOC Akranes  ] if the town would be interested in receiving the refugees . 
On May 19 , the town council decided unanimously to start talks with the [ORG Ministry of Social Affairs  ] on receiving the refugees. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [ORG Refugee Council  ] 's proposal immediately sparked debate within the [LOC Akranes  ] branch of the [ORG Liberal Party  ] ( [ORG LP  ] ) , which is part of the governing majority on the town council . 
[PER Magnus Thor Hafsteinsson  ] , the national [ORG LP  ] Deputy Chairman and the party 's first alternate town councilor in [LOC Akranes  ] , opposed the reception of the refugees on several grounds . 
He said that the inhabitants had not been previously informed of the possible arrival of the refugees , and he also stated that the town was already short of funds to tackle an increase in the town 's own social problems . 
In response , on May 14 the [ORG LP  ] 's sitting town councilor , [PER Karen Jonsdottir  ] , left the party , citing her disagreement with [PER Hafsteinsson  ] 's remarks . 
[PER Jonsdottir  ] switched ranks to the [ORG Independence Party  ] ( [ORG IP  ] ) , giving the [ORG IP  ] a single-party majority on the council. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The refugee issue has sparked a debate in [LOC Akranes  ] and divided the town into two opposing camps . 
The opponents have even started a signature petition in the town against receiving the refugees , though the town council has been dismissive of what appears to be a poorly-organized effort . 
This is the first time that refugee admissions have generated such a strong reaction in [LOC Iceland  ] , despite the fact that the majority of the 227 refugees settled in [LOC Iceland  ] since 1996 have also gone to smaller towns rather than [LOC Reykjavik  ] and suburbs. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Comment:  ] The signature petition and [PER Hafsteinsson  ] 's comments are characteristic of growing xenophobic tensions in [MISC Icelandic  ] society . 
[LOC Iceland  ] 's extremely low unemployment and need for foreign labor means this friction cannot be ascribed to frustrated [MISC Icelanders'  ] losing jobs to foreign immigrant labor . 
Rather , this appears to be a function of a homogenic society -- dating from the original [MISC Viking Age  ] settlement -- coming into more frequent contact with other cultures , people of different skin color , and new residents who speak languages not understood by native Icelanders . 
This is also the first time [LOC Iceland  ] has agreed to accept refugees from the [LOC Middle East  ] , an element which may be causing further discomfort. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment , cont 'd : Additionally , [PER Hafsteinsson  ] seems to be making another run at trying out a nationalistic plank for the [ORG Liberal Party  ] platform . 
His previous attempt just prior to the 2007 parliamentary elections gave the [ORG LP  ] a short-term boost in polls but failed to bring long-term success as all other parties publicly announced they would not join a government coalition with the [ORG LP  ] . 
In the end , the [ORG LP  ] took just five percent of the vote nationwide . 
However , if [LOC Iceland  ] 's recent economic troubles worsen and unemployment becomes a significant problem , [PER Hafsteinsson  ] may find more fertile ground for his efforts .
