<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ZAGREB 001231 SIPDIS SIPDIS STATE FOR EUR/SCE NSC FOR BRAUN EO 12958 DECL: 10/11/2016 TAGS PREL , PGOV , HR , [ORG EUN  ] , [ORG NATO  ] SUBJECT: SCENESETTER - PM SANADER’S MEETING WITH PRESIDENT BUSH Classified By: Ambassador [PER Robert A. Bradtke  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . 
A “BALKANS” SUCCESS STORY ------------------------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Fifteen years after the death of [LOC Yugoslavia  ] and eleven years after a horrible civil war , [LOC Croatia  ] is poised to become that rarity ) a [LOC Balkans  ] success story . 
With [ORG EU  ] entry negotiations underway , tourism arrivals breaking records , and new construction on every corner , [LOC Croatia  ] is rebranding itself as a leader in [LOC Southeastern Europe  ] . 
Espresso has triumphed over [MISC Turkish  ] coffee and new highways have brought [LOC Zagreb  ] within ninety minutes of the warmth of the [LOC Adriatic  ] , shrinking both the geographic and psychological distance . 
Prime Minister [PER Ivo Sanader  ] has staked his political career on continued progress and complete integration with [MISC Euro-Atlantic  ] institutions such as [ORG NATO  ] and the [ORG European Union  ] . 
Despite those few still nostalgic for some idealized version of the past ( such as PM Sanader’s aging political rival President [PER Mesic  ] , who recently attended the [ORG Non-Aligned Movement Summit  ] in homage to [MISC Tito  ] ) , most younger [MISC Croatians  ] can’t get to the future fast enough . 
[MISC Croatians  ] don’t all agree on what the future looks like , but all significant political parties share a commitment to democracy , free markets , and [MISC Euro-Atlantic  ] integration . 
PM [PER Sanader  ] , s October 17 meeting with President [PER Bush  ] will help keep the public focus on his positive vision of the future , and will help his moderate center-right coalition when they face the electorate next year . 
SANADER’S AGENDA ---------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Prime Minister [PER Sanader  ] has made the rounds of all the major [MISC European  ] capitals , but he knows that [LOC Washington  ] is the capital that really counts . 
He sees his visit to the [ORG Oval Office  ] as both a national and a personal success: the seal of approval on [MISC Croatia’s Euro-Atlantic  ] future and proof that it has consolidated and strengthened its democratic credentials , but also an endorsement of his effort to sideline nationalists within his party and head full throttle towards integration with the [LOC West  ] . 
The [LOC White House  ] visit will burnish Sanader’s own political image in advance of next year’s parliamentary elections and enable him to show both domestic and foreign audiences that we consider [LOC Croatia  ] a serious partner. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Apart from this symbolism , [PER Sanader  ] will be seeking the President’s support for strong [ORG NATO  ] enlargement language at [ORG November’s Riga Summit  ] . 
The [MISC Croatian  ] government’s most important strategic goals are membership in [ORG NATO  ] and the [ORG European Union  ] ; [PER Sanader  ] hopes to return from [LOC Washington  ] with some public acknowledgment that his country is on the right path towards [MISC Euro-Atlantic  ] integration . 
This has become even more critical after [ORG EU Commission  ] President [PER Barroso  ] , s declaration of a “pause” in [ORG EU  ] enlargement . 
[PER Sanader  ] may also seek our support for a non-permanent seat on the [ORG UN Security Council  ] , as [LOC Croatia  ] seeks to play a broader role in international affairs . 
ADVANCING [LOC U.S.  ] INTERESTS ------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) For the most part , [PER Sanader  ] has already paid up front for this meeting over the course of his nearly three years in power as head of a center-right coalition government . 
He has purged the extreme nationalists from his party , exorcising the ghost of the late president [PER Franjo Tudjman  ] . 
He assisted in extraditing [MISC Croatia’s  ] last major indicted war criminal [PER Ante Gotovina  ] to the [ORG International Criminal Tribunal  ] for the former [LOC Yugoslavia  ] in the [LOC Hague  ] . 
He reached out to the ethnic [MISC Serb  ] community , even including [MISC Serb  ] parliamentarians in his coalition . 
He has pushed to normalize relations with [LOC Belgrade  ] at considerable political risk , given that memories of the 1991-1995 war with [LOC Serbia  ] are still painfully raw. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In the military sphere , Sanader’s government has made considerable progress on a major defense reform effort that will fully professionalize the armed services . 
The [ORG GOC  ] overcame initial reluctance and now works energetically with less-developed [MISC Macedonian  ] and [MISC Albanian  ] militaries in the [LOC U.S.-Adriatic Charter  ] ( the “A-3” ) to demonstrate regional credentials . 
[LOC Croatia  ] participates in twelve [ORG UN  ] peace support operations around the world , including a leadership role in [LOC Kashmir  ] . 
Most importantly , [PER Sanader  ] this summer delivered on a promise to triple [MISC Croatia’s  ] self-financed contribution to [ORG NATO  ] forces in [LOC Afghanistan  ] to 150 , with plans to increase that number further next year . 
ZAGREB 00001231 002 OF 002 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) We can usefully push [PER Sanader  ] to do more to prepare [LOC Croatia  ] for [ORG NATO  ] accession ; [PER Sanader  ] himself should be more active in generating public support for Alliance membership and continue required political , economic , and defense reforms . 
He must also step up the battle against corruption , and help put the legacies of the [ORG Balkan Wars  ] to rest by fully implementing promised refugee return programs . 
In a still-unsettled region , [PER Sanader  ] has the credibility to play a constructive role , with our guidance , in promoting constitutional reform in [LOC Bosnia-Herzegovina  ] and in speaking out for a peaceful resolution of [LOC Kosovo  ] status issues . 
CULTIVATING A FUTURE PARTNER AND ALLY IN THE REGION --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [LOC Croatia  ] is a small country . 
Its contribution to regional and global security will always be modest , its engagement capacity limited , its markets minor . 
Nevertheless , by reaching out to a new generation of democratic political leadership and its westward leaning electorate , we serve our regional interests well . 
The challenge is to shape the structure of bilateral relations most productively in the coming months to pave the way for greater cooperation . 
In concrete terms , this means concluding agreements in such areas as civil aviation , law enforcement , and a Supplemental [ORG SOFA  ] , promoting investments like the [LOC U.S.  ] firm [ORG Barr’s  ] upcoming USD 2.5 billion acquisition of [ORG Pliva  ] pharmaceuticals , promoting more people-to-people exchanges , and supporting [MISC Croatia’s  ] [ORG NATO  ] candidacy . 
Sanader’s visit to [LOC Washington  ] will provide a stronger impetus to build both our bilateral and our regional partnership with [LOC Croatia  ] .
