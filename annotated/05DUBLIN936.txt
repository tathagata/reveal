The [MISC Bulgarian  ] Ambassador in [LOC Dublin  ] denies any [MISC Bulgarian  ] involvement and wishes that [LOC Ireland  ] would close off this line of inquiry publicly . 
[MISC Irish  ] officials , more generally , remain concerned that [ORG IRA  ] funds acquired through sophisticated investments are seeping into resources available for [PER Sinn Fein’s  ] political activities in the [LOC Republic of Ireland  ] . 
Post expects that [MISC Irish  ] officials will remain reticent on details of the money-laundering investigation until charges are filed . 
End summary . 
Linking the [ORG Bank Robbery and Money Seizures  ] ------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The roughly [ORG STG  ] 3 million seized in [LOC Dublin  ] and [ORG Cork  ] the week of February 14 ( ref B ) is “beyond doubt” a portion of the [ORG STG  ] 26.5 million stolen from [ORG Belfast’s Northern Bank  ] on December 20 , 2004 , according to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and the [ORG Department of Justice , Equality  ] , and [ORG Law Reform  ] ( [ORG DOJ  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] related to [ORG Emboff  ] the GOI’s belief that up to 16 individuals questioned by [ORG Garda  ] ( police ) in connection with the seizures were attempting to launder the stolen proceeds on behalf of the [ORG Provisional IRA  ] ( [ORG PIRA  ] ) . 
This belief was based on information provided by [ORG Garda  ] intelligence assets and by “walk-ins” who , in some instances , voluntarily turned over cash that they had been asked to hide ( [ORG STG  ] 300,000 in one case ) . 
While intelligence pointed clearly to a money-laundering operation , the challenge was to build forensic ties between the money seized and the stolen [ORG Northern Bank  ] notes in order to support a court conviction . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that [ORG Garda  ] , led by the [ORG Criminal Assets Bureau  ] , were still attempting to establish forensic links through the tracking system used by the [ORG Northern Bank  ] for bank note bundles in its possession at the time of December robbery. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) If such ties could be established before autumn , the Director of [ORG Public Prosecutions  ] ( [ORG DPP  ] ) , [PER James Hamilton  ] , would be in a position to bring money-laundering charges by late 2005 against a number of those questioned , said [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
( To date , no one has been charged , except a [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , who was charged with membership in the [ORG IRA  ] , an illegal organization . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] Once charges are brought , it would likely take a year to begin the court case . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that [PER Hamilton  ] could possibly opt for a special non-jury criminal court consisting of three judges , an option that was sometimes used for cases involving unlawful organizations like the [ORG IRA  ] . 
When [ORG Emboff  ] asked who would likely face charges , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] replied that , of those brought in for [ORG Garda  ] questioning , no one had been ruled out as beyond suspicion [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] He added that the operative legislation in the case would likely be the Proceeds of [ORG Crime Act of 1997  ] , rather than the [ORG Criminal Justice Act of 2005  ] , since the latter focused primarily on terrorism. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In separate discussions with the Ambassador , DCM , and [MISC Emboffs  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that investigations into the money-laundering case could still take several months , as police used DNA and other scientific techniques to pursue a connection to the [ORG Northern Bank  ] raid . 
He commented that the money-laundering operation had been poorly conducted , due most likely to the unexpected size of the bank haul . 
Investigators were focused primarily on [PER Ted Cunningham  ] and [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ----------------------- [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) More generally , the [ORG DOJ  ] and [ORG Garda  ] continue to be concerned that money illegally acquired by the [ORG IRA  ] was “seeping” into resources available for [PER Sinn Finn’s  ] political activities in the [LOC Republic of Ireland  ] , said the [ORG DOJXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
The difficulty lay in documenting the mixing of such funds . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that the Standards in [ORG Public Office Commission  ] ( [ORG SIPO  ] ) was similarly concerned that political donations obtained by [PER Sinn Fein  ] in the [LOC United States  ] and elsewhere overseas were being spent in the [LOC South  ] . 
( Under a 2002 [ORG SIPO  ] ruling , [PER Sinn Fein  ] can accept donations from non-Irish citizens in foreign countries , but only for activities outside the [LOC Republic of Ireland  ] , i.e. , in [LOC Northern Ireland  ] . 
) He noted that the [ORG DOJ  ] would be interested to see whether and how the [MISC IRA  ] might address criminality in its expected response to [PER Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams’  ] call for an end to republican paramilitarism . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] added that the awaited [ORG IRA  ] statement would have no bearing on the money-laundering case or other investigations into possible [ORG IRA  ] crimes committed since the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] commented that [ORG IRA  ] money was constantly moving , flowing from diversified sources into wide-ranging investments . 
While the [MISC IRA  ] had been proficient in smuggling , robbery , and racketeering since the 1970s , the [MISC Celtic Tiger  ] economic boom of the 1990s had prompted the [ORG IRA  ] to diversify into more sophisticated business enterprises . 
[ORG IRA  ] investments now included real estate ventures in [LOC Dublin  ] , [LOC London  ] , and [MISC Spanish  ] resort areas , handled by apparently respectable businessmen . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also expressed concern about the commingling of ill-gotten [ORG IRA  ] funds with [PER Sinn Fein’s  ] political coffers in the [LOC Republic of Ireland  ] . 
The irony , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] explained , was that [PER Sinn Fein  ] was already raising substantial sums for its political activities in the [LOC South  ] through legal avenues . 
He pointed out , for example , that [PER Sinn Fein  ] conducted at least 60 fund-raisers in the [LOC South  ] per week for its electoral war chest . 
Comment: GOI Reticence ---------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] made clear to [MISC Emboffs  ] that the ongoing investigation into the money-laundering case constrained their ability to provide more information , as the lack of detail in their observations bears out . 
We expect that GOI officials will remain reticent until charges are actually filed , a step that may also be delayed by continuing investigations into the [ORG Northern Bank  ] robbery itself . 
[ORG Garda  ] and [ORG DOJ  ] representatives are also likely to continue to be quiet in public and in discussions with us regarding funding of [PER Sinn Fein  ] , s activities in the [LOC Republic of Ireland  ] . 
As a political force in the [LOC South  ] , [PER Sinn Fein  ] has limited reach , but is seen as the most well-organized and best-funded party . 
Competing parties , including the governing [ORG Fianna Fail  ] party , are anxious to ensure that [PER Sinn Fein  ] members/supporters abide by [MISC Irish  ] law and are subject to public scrutiny when they do not . 
Both the [ORG Garda  ] ( traditionally tough on the republican movement writ large , due to its terrorist connections ) and political levels of the government will be careful to avoid the public perception that any legal pursuit of [PER Sinn Fein/IRA-tied  ] personalities in the [LOC South  ] is politically connected .
