( C ) Your visit to [LOC Moscow  ] provides an opportunity to strengthen bilateral economic relations at a time when both our economies are beginning to show signs of recovery following an extremely difficult year . 
Because our economic relations with [LOC Russia  ] were relatively stable even prior to the political " reset " we 've seen this year , we are well-positioned to press for progress on a few key issues , including [LOC Russia  ] 's [ORG WTO  ] accession , agricultural trade and intellectual property rights , where more work is needed . 
End Summary . 
[MISC U.S.-Russian Relations  ] ---------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Four meetings this year between Presidents [PER Obama  ] and [PER Medvedev  ] , including the President 's July visit to [LOC Moscow  ] , and Secretary [PER Clinton  ] 's numerous discussions with Foreign Minister [PER Lavrov  ] have given impetus to real change in our bilateral relations . 
Addressing the ruling [ORG United Russia  ] party congress November 21 , President [PER Medvedev  ] even used the phrase " reset " - heretofore reserved for issues involving the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia  ] - and called for an " economic reset " as well . 
We want to see this will applied not just to the modernization that [PER Medvedev  ] is advocating for [LOC Russia  ] itself , but to its interaction with foreign investors and integration into global financial institutions , all of which force reforms deeper into the system . 
The challenge , as always , is to translate rhetoric into specific decisions and joint actions. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) For the first time in years , we have structure in the relationship to do this . 
The [ORG Obama-Medvedev Commission  ] has four working groups--business development and economic relations , energy , nuclear energy , and agriculture--with a remit to broaden the economic base of interaction between us . 
The [ORG Commission  ] will give us regular , focused interaction with influential centers of [LOC Russia  ] 's business and economic decision-making . 
In early contacts , some [MISC Russian  ] participants in the working groups have shown a preference fro form over substance , though . 
We need to continue to set a higher standard . 
The [ORG Commission  ] needs to produce results , not reports , and decisions , not dialogue . 
Global Economic Crisis And [LOC Russia  ] 's Response -------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The global economic crisis hit [LOC Russia  ] particularly hard , as the economy remains heavily dependent on commodities exports ( primarily oil and gas ) for growth , and on foreign capital for investment . 
The abrupt drop in the price of oil combined with a decline in foreign investment strained the [MISC Russian  ] economy , beginning in mid-2008 . 
Throughout the following twelve-month period , [MISC Russian  ] industrial production plummeted , with double-digit declines in month-on-month production occurring on a regular basis . 
Key sectors such as steel and automobiles were hit particularly hard , with [MISC Russian  ] domestic automobile production declining by over 50% in the first half of 2009 . 
The industrial sector , particularly the single-company towns , was hard hit , with unemployment remaining at an unprecedented high . 
Predictions for 2009 GDP decline grew from 3% early in the year , to the current estimates of 7.5%. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) At the beginning of the crisis , the [MISC Russian  ] government held the third largest quantity of reserves internationally and relatively little sovereign debt . 
Thus , the [ORG GOR  ] was much better positioned to react than many other countries . 
The [ORG GOR  ] burned through a third of these reserves ( an estimated $200 billion ) to slow the decline of the ruble . 
The [ORG GOR  ] also provided large infusions of capital into the domestic financial sector in an effort to keep stressed banks afloat . 
In addition , the [MISC Russian  ] government instituted a series of " temporary crisis measures , " including tariff increases and other import restrictions , in an effort to protect domestic production in key sectors and increase demand. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) While these measures were successful in staving off a complete collapse of the financial sector a la 1998 , they have come at a price . 
Official [MISC Russian  ] reserves are significantly lower than at the start of the crisis and we expect the [ORG GOR  ] will be required to borrow , including on international markets , in order to cover its expected federal budget deficit in 2010 . 
Also , while the infusions of cash into the financial system prevented a total meltdown , banks used much of the funding to make provisions for non-performing loans and other distressed assets . 
The infusions of cash did not result in a resumption of lending , and domestic financing remains hard to come by , constraining efforts to stimulate the real economy. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The tariff and other trade barriers did slow imports during the first half of 2009 , but the reduced competition did not appear to do much to help domestic producers . 
Domestic demand , particularly in the automotive and real estate sectors , remains extremely weak . 
The [ORG GOR  ] has pushed companies to retain workers during the economic downturn , in an effort to slow unemployment growth and avoid potential social difficulties . 
As a result , many companies have used their limited reserves to continue paying workers and are not well placed to take advantage of an economic up-turn when it arrives . 
That said , [LOC Russia  ] appears to have muddled through the worst of the crisis and , aided by higher oil prices and a strengthening ruble , [ORG GOR  ] officials are now considering how to encourage a return to strong economic growth . 
Key Challenges To [MISC Russian  ] Economic Growth ----------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Dmitriy Medvedev  ] has made a central theme of his presidency [LOC Russia  ] 's need to diversify its economy , develop an innovation economy based on its strong intellectual resources , integrate itself into the global economy and deal with the problems created by corruption . 
While we support these objectives , we are concerned that progress has been limited , at best . 
The recent economic crisis dealt yet another blow to [LOC Russia  ] 's limited industrial base . 
The lack of domestic financing limits entrepreneurs' efforts to move into new sectors . 
Weak enforcement of intellectual property laws and gaps in key areas , such as protections on encryption technologies , restrict growth in IT and other innovative sectors . 
[LOC Russia  ] 's on-again , off-again approach to [ORG WTO  ] accession has not only slowed down [LOC Russia  ] 's own accession process , but has also made it difficult for others , such as the [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG EU  ] , who are interested in supporting [LOC Russia  ] 's accession . 
[LOC Russia  ] 's continued tariff and non-tariff restrictions on agricultural trade also present challenges to increasing bilateral [MISC U.S.-Russia  ] trade , as many [LOC U.S.  ] producers are simply not able to export their products to [LOC Russia  ] . 
Finally , corruption and " legal nihilism " continue to plague the [MISC Russian  ] governance system ; the death in custody of [MISC Russian  ] lawyer [PER Sergey Magnitskiy  ] is only the latest example . 
Domestic Political Context -------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) After a year and a half of tandem leadership of [LOC Russia  ] , [PER Medvedev  ] and [PER Putin  ] continue to function based on a division of labor . 
The President plays to his strengths of clear public presentation and a long-range focus on a modern economy , and underscores his constitutional responsibilities for foreign policy . 
His November 12 annual address to the nation again highlighted and expanded on the theme of economic modernization , and to a lesser extent political reform as well . 
[PER Putin  ] , meanwhile , has built on his image of a domestic problem solver , employing his trademark street-wise rhetoric in dressing down oligarchs or critics . 
His November 21 address to the annual congress of the [ORG United Russia  ] party ( which he heads ) reaffirmed public perceptions of him as the man who is making sure government pays pensions and salaries . 
A just-published poll supports this: though their ratings had been declining , they shot up to 74 and 79 percent , respectively , after their strong performances. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Although there is evidence that their closest advisors spar over specific policies and personnel matters , the two leaders themselves share state-run national media coverage ( to the near-exclusion of other political figures ) and project an aura of ease with one another in public . 
[PER Medvedev  ] has yet to make major changes to the senior staff he inherited from [PER Putin  ] . 
[PER Putin  ] 's prominence in tackling crises - whether conflict with [LOC Georgia  ] , gas supply negotiations with [LOC Ukraine  ] , or localized unrest or frustration due to the economic crisis - earns him higher public opinion ratings and elite group allegiance than [PER Medvedev  ] . 
This , combined with his suggestions that he might stand for a third presidential term , all ensure that major decisions are not made without [PER Putin  ] 's approval . 
The complete national dominance of the ruling [ORG United Russia  ] party under the leadership of [PER Putin  ] , reinforced through the party 's overwhelming , yet tainted victory in October 11 regional elections , has made it difficult for opposition parties to function , let alone capitalize on economic discontent . 
Conclusion ---------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) In sum , your visit comes at a promising moment--both our bilateral relations and our economies are beginning to move in a more positive direction , but challenges remain . 
We encourage you to use your meetings with key [MISC Russian  ] governmental and private interlocutors , as well as with the [MISC American  ] business community , to push for continued dialogue leading to concrete positive action . 
We want [LOC Russia  ] to integrate into the global economy , to join the [ORG WTO  ] , to diversify its productive base and to move forward in the fight against corruption and we stand ready to work with [LOC Russia  ] on these issues . 
Your meetings with [PER Medvedev  ] 's top economic adviser Dvorkovich and First Deputy Foreign Minister [PER Denisov  ] , in particular , are a chance to move beyond improved atmospherics and examine in greater depth how we can support the best of [PER Medvedev  ] 's modernization goals--e.g. , greater energy efficiency--in ways that pay dividends to both economies and broaden the economic base of the relationship .
