( C ) President [PER Manuel  ] &Mel8 [PER Zelaya  ] shared details in a June a 7 meeting with the Ambassador , accompanied by the [ORG DCM  ] , on his negotiations with [ORG ALBA  ] members and [LOC Cuba  ] over the negotiations on [LOC Cuba  ] at the [ORG Organization of American States General Assembly  ] in [LOC San Pedro  ] Sula June 2 and 3 . 
[PER Zelaya  ] said that his goal on the negotiations was to take everyone 's interest into account ; he said that while the negotiations were difficult , he believed that he had met his goal . 
[PER Zelaya  ] praised Secretary [PER Hillary Clinton  ] for her work during the General [ORG Assembly  ] , adding that he thought that in their second and last meeting she had made a very convincing and powerful case for the [LOC U.S.  ] position , which had impacted greatly on him . 
In fact , he said , that while he and many other OAS members quickly realized the value of the [LOC U.S.  ] offer to support a resolution dropping the [LOC Cuba  ] ban as long as it included a requirement that [LOC Cuba  ] apply for membership and that membership be contingent on [LOC Cuba  ] adhering to [ORG OAS  ] principles , convincing fellow [ORG ALBA  ] members to accept the text had been difficult . 
[PER Zelaya  ] said that the reason he was unable to provide the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation with a text the night of June 2 was due to [ORG ALBA  ] intransience . 
[PER Zelaya  ] said that he spoke with President [PER Hugo Chavez  ] , [PER Daniel Ortega  ] and other [ORG ALBA  ] members to press them to accept the compromise draft , eventually threatening to withdraw [LOC Honduras  ] from [ORG ALBA  ] if they did not agree ( please protect ) . 
He said that he had told [PER Chavez  ] and [PER Ortega  ] that as hosts of the Assembly the lack of agreement would be a major disaster for him personally and for his government . 
[PER Zelaya  ] also said that he had made one final call to [PER Fidel Castro  ] , who gave his approval of the draft . 
By the morning of June 3 , [PER Zelaya  ] said [ORG ALBA  ] members changed their positions and agreed to accept the draft. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Zelaya  ] also spoke of the difficulty of dealing with the [ORG ALBA  ] presidents who visited or wanted to visit the assembly . 
[PER Zelaya  ] said that President [PER Daniel Ortega  ] insisted on speaking at the inaugural session of the assembly , which the [MISC GOH  ] controlled . 
[PER Zelaya  ] said , however , that , true to his word to us ( reftel ) , only OAS Secretary General [PER Jose Miguel Insulza  ] and he spoke . 
He said that he offered [PER Ortega  ] instead a press conference after the inaugural session , to which [PER Ortega  ] eventually agreed . 
President [PER Rafael Correa  ] , who was in [LOC Honduras  ] for a bilateral visit before and during the visit , also demanded a speaking role and decided not to attend the assembly when [PER Zelaya  ] refused . 
[PER Chavez  ] also pressed him for a speaking role , [PER Zelaya  ] said , and in the end did not attend. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Zelaya  ] found himself trapped between his desire to please both the [LOC U.S.  ] and his [ORG ALBA  ] friends at the OAS . 
The need to produce a successful assembly won out , however , and [PER Zelaya  ] successfully pressured [ORG ALBA  ] to accept our text . 
The Secretary 's presence was important , as [PER Zelaya  ] wants good relations with the new administration and wanted her visit to be successful . 
[PER Zelaya  ] kept his word to us on not allowing any of the [ORG ALBA  ] presidents to speak at the assembly , at some effort according to his version . 
We note , however , that had he not issued them invitations , he would not have had to fend of their speaking requests .
