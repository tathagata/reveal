( C ) SUMMARY: President [PER John Evans Atta Mills  ] has made private statements backed with public actions about his intention to reduce Ghana’s growing role in the drugs trade . 
GOG agencies are following his lead and have also made a discernible effort to eliminate drugs in the country . 
END SUMMARY <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) One highly visible step taken by the President early in his administration to show that no one is above the law when it comes to smuggling drugs was to submit voluntarily to a thorough security screening when he departed from the airport on his first overseas state visit . 
He made a point of submitting his luggage to a search and required his entire entourage to do the same . 
The airport itemizers used to detect drugs were provided by the [MISC USG.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) President [PER Mills  ] took a significant step toward controlling the proliferation of drugs in his country by supporting the creation of a [ORG USG  ] funded vetted anti-narcotics unit . 
In the past , the police lost a large amount of drugs kept in their possession that was to be used as evidence in future trials . 
The [ORG USG  ] is building a secure room at police headquarters in which to store evidence in future drugs cases. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Within the past two weeks , [ORG Narcotics Control Board  ] ( [ORG NACOB  ] ) officials have arrested four couriers transiting Accra’s international airport and seized between 1kg and 1.5kg each time . 
In another case involving regional law enforcement cooperation , a courier was allowed to transit [LOC Ghana  ] successfully before being arrested in neighboring [PER Cote  ] d’Ivoire along with the intended recipient of the drugs . 
XXXXXXXXXX <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The President told the Ambassador that he knows elements of his government are already compromised and that officials at the airport tipped off drug traffickers about operations there . 
The Interior Minister has said that there is a proposal to elevate the [ORG NACOB  ] to a stand alone [ORG Commission  ] that would report directly to the President . 
Such a move would enhance the status of the [ORG NACOB  ] and give it more control over its budget , including better pay for staff. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [ORG NACOB  ] is not the only agency working to eliminate narcotics trafficking in [LOC Ghana  ] . 
The [ORG Ghana Immigration Service  ] has been extremely cooperative in assisting [ORG DEA  ] with the extradition of two suspected [MISC Colombian  ] drug lords from [LOC Togo  ] . 
Recently , [LOC Ghana  ] border officials opened the border at 4:30am to allow [ORG DEA  ] agents to move one suspect en route to board a flight to the [LOC US  ] . 
In an operation involving another GOG agency , the [ORG Bureau of National Investigation  ] ( [ORG BNI  ] ) partnered with the [ORG DEA  ] to make a controlled delivery of 4kg of cocaine that resulted in the arrest of the recipient. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( SBU ) Last month , a container in the port of [LOC Tema  ] marked as chewing gum raised the suspicion of [LOC Ghana  ] [ORG Ports Authority  ] , [ORG Customs  ] , Excise , and [ORG Preventative Service  ] ( [ORG CEPS  ] ) because it originated in [LOC Ecuador  ] rather than the [LOC Far East  ] , as usual . 
When [ORG CEPS  ] opened the container , they found 71.4kg of cocaine . 
The find led to the arrest of five people , and police are now looking at asset forfeiture of the company that imported the shipment. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) President [PER Mills  ] has stated that he is resolute in stopping people from using [LOC Ghana  ] as a narcotics transit corridor and will vigorously fight for the total eradication of hard drugs in the country . 
So far , he has shown a good faith effort .
