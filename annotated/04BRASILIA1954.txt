( [ORG U  ] ) [MISC Brazilian  ] newspapers , including a banner August 3 front page , above-the-fold headline in widely read [ORG O Estado de Sao Paulo  ] , highlighted the [ORG Pentagon  ] 's selection of [ORG Lockheed-Martin  ] -- teamed with [ORG Embraer  ] and the [ORG Harris Corporation  ] -- to develop and build the [LOC U.S.  ] military 's next generation airborne intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance system , the [ORG Ariel Common Sensor  ] ( [ORG ACS  ] ) . 
[ORG Embraer  ] will provide the airframe based on its successful ERJ145/EMB 145 model already widely used around the world and build the airframe at a new assembly line at the old [ORG USN Cecil Field Air Station  ] near [LOC Jacksonville  ] , [LOC Florida  ] . 
Newspapers here report the total package for the [ORG ACS  ] as between [ORG USD  ] 7 and 10 billion. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The contract is being trumpeted in [MISC Brazilian  ] media as a breakthrough achievement for [ORG Embraer  ] , the world 's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer . 
[ORG Embraer  ] is already [LOC Brazil  ] 's largest single importer from ( aircraft components ) and exporter to ( finished aircraft ) the [LOC United States  ] . 
Even with the involvement of [ORG Embraer  ] 's [LOC U.S.  ] partners , the contract represents [LOC Brazil  ] 's most significant procurement opportunity ever with the [LOC U.S.  ] military . 
It is also viewed as a shot in the arm for potential aircraft sales elsewhere. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Comment:  ] The [ORG ACS  ] contract is a victory for [MISC Brazilian  ] technology and [LOC Brazil  ] 's aerospace industry . 
Yet , while [ORG Embraer  ] and [ORG Lockheed-Martin  ] closely collaborated to develop the [ORG ACS  ] , the two companies remain on opposing sides in [LOC Brazil  ] 's next generation jet fighter competition , the [MISC F-X  ] ( Note: [ORG Embraer  ] is partnered exclusively with the [ORG Dassault Mirage  ] bid in the competition . 
) A GOB decision on the [MISC F-X  ] , delayed numerous times since 2002 , continues to be in limbo due , many observers believe , to the sticker shock of the total cost of new high performance fighters . 
However , with the victory of the Lockheed-Martin/Embraer consortium in the [ORG ACS  ] competition , [LOC Brazil  ] 's leadership may look with a fresh eye at used [MISC F-16  ] offers that are significantly cheaper than new fighters .
