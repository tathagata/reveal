BOYDEN  ] GRAY REF: A. A ) [ORG BAKU  ] 494 [PER B. B  ] ) ASHBABAT 817 [PER C. C  ] ) [ORG ANKARA  ] 1172 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Anne E. Derse  ] , reasons 1.4 ( b , d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Your second visit to [LOC Baku  ] comes on the heels of your early June participation in the [MISC Fifteenth Annual Caspian Oil  ] and [ORG Gas Exhibition  ] and Conference ( ref A ) , and your subsequent early July letter to President [PER Aliyev  ] providing input for next steps we can take together to pursue joint [MISC USG-GOAJ  ] energy goals of a viable gas transit regime through [LOC Turkey  ] , enhanced [MISC GOAJ-GOTX  ] energy cooperation , and effective [ORG EU  ] outreach to [LOC Azerbaijan  ] . 
The [ORG GOAJ  ] is pleased with the increased [ORG USG  ] engagement on energy . 
We have heard that President [PER Aliyev  ] was very pleased with the congratulatory letter from President [PER Bush  ] that you read during the opening [ORG COGS  ] ceremony . 
[ORG SOCAR  ] Vice-President [PER Elshad Nassirov  ] , a key energy advisor to President [PER Aliyev  ] with whom you will meet in the absence of [ORG SOCAR  ] President [PER Rovnag Abullayev  ] , relayed [ORG Azerbaijan’s  ] enthusiasm about the “next steps” letter you sent to President [PER Aliyev  ] , and is working with the President to discuss it with you . 
[LOC TURKEY  ] --------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) President [PER Aliyev  ] will be very interested in your just completed visit to [LOC Turkey  ] . 
As you are aware , [ORG Azerbaijan’s  ] desire to conclude sales and purchase agreements for [MISC Shah Deniz Phase Two  ] ( [ORG SD2  ] ) gas with [MISC European  ] customers has been held up for over a year by an inability to secure gas transit through [LOC Turkey  ] . 
Solving transit for [ORG SD2  ] gas through [LOC Turkey  ] is also linked both to selling volumes of [ORG SD2  ] gas to [LOC Turkey  ] , and to renegotiations for the price of [MISC Shah Deniz Phase One  ] gas currently being sold to [LOC Turkey  ] . 
[LOC Turkey  ] has said it seeks “all” of SD2’s approximately 13 billion cubic meters annually ( bcm/a ) for its domestic needs , but will settle for 8 bcm/a . 
However , [LOC Azerbaijan  ] wishes to sell it no more than 4 bcm/a so that 6 bcm/a of [ORG SD2  ] gas remains to sell to [LOC Europe  ] , enough to sanction one pipeline project ( [ORG SOCAR  ] assumes that 3 bcm/a of [ORG SD2  ] will go for domestic use and/or [LOC Georgia  ] ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [MISC Shah Deniz Consortium’s  ] commercial negotiations with the three pipeline projects competing for [ORG SD2  ] gas ( [ORG TAP  ] , Nabucco TGI ) are at a standstill until transit through [LOC Turkey  ] is solved , and the [ORG GOAJ  ] continues a policy of seeking to persuade intermediaries such as the [ORG EU  ] , [ORG USG  ] and various commercial companies vying for [ORG SD2  ] gas to put pressure on [LOC Turkey  ] to provide commercially viable transit . 
In this regard , [LOC Azerbaijan  ] seeks to persuade [LOC Turkey  ] that “Azerbaijan has options” for [ORG SD2  ] gas that don’t require transit through [LOC Turkey  ] , to include [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , and a “Nabucco without [MISC Turkey”  ] option that re-routes Nabucco from [LOC Georgia  ] across the [LOC Black Sea  ] to [LOC Bulgaria  ] . 
[LOC TURKMENISTAN  ] ---------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Although bilateral relations between the two countries have improved significantly due to [ORG Azerbaijan’s  ] diplomatic outreach to President [PER Berdimuhamedov  ] since the latter’s accession , currently joint cooperation over offshore energy development seems dependent upon resolving the status of the offshore [MISC Serder-Kyapaz  ] field . 
The [ORG GOTX  ] seeks [ORG GOAJ  ] acknowledgement of full [MISC Turkmen  ] ownership of this field in exchange for the [ORG GOTX  ] dropping its claims on the [LOC ACG  ] field . 
Given such acknowledgement , the [ORG GOTX  ] would be willing to ship [ORG S-K  ] production through [LOC Azerbaijan  ] . 
However , [LOC Azerbaijan  ] seeks at least minority [ORG S-K  ] ownership , while repeating its assertion that any discussion of [LOC ACG  ] status is “off the table.” <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) There is ongoing cooperation between the two countries in preparation for an early September joint Energy Exhibition and Conference focusing on joint reserves to be held in [LOC Baku  ] . 
This is a seminal event in growing [MISC Azerbaijan-Turkmen  ] relations , and we will want to be as supportive as possible . 
In this regard , [ORG SOCAR  ] has asked whom from the [ORG US Government  ] should be invited to this joint exhibition and conference , asking if it would be possible for Secretary Rice to come . 
[ORG SOCAR  ] has also asked for [ORG USG  ] input as to what [MISC US-based  ] organizations should be invited to this joint [MISC GOAJ-GOTX  ] September conference ( mentioning [ORG OPIC  ] as one possibility ) . 
[ORG EU  ] --- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG SOCAR  ] has expressed concerns about [ORG European Commission  ] ( [ORG EC  ] ) proposals it has indirectly heard about , to include [ORG EC  ] attempts to link gas transit through [LOC Turkey  ] with energy sector development in [LOC Turkmenistan  ] ( ref C - [ORG “Caspian Development Corporation.” SD Consortium  ] member [ORG StatoilHydro  ] also expressed grave misgivings about such reftel plans during a July 10 meeting with Ambassador Derse-septel . 
) On another matter , [ORG SOCAR  ] ( along with [ORG SD Consortium  ] member [ORG StatoilHydro  ] ) have expressed a “level of comfort” with [ORG EU  ] verbal assurances to allow joint marketing of [ORG SD2  ] gas into [LOC Europe  ] , so while they would also welcome a written guarantee , they don’t deem it essential . 
TRANSIT OF [MISC KAZAKH OIL  ] ---------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Much as a transparent and commercially viable gas transit regime through [LOC Turkey  ] is essential to attract both [LOC Azerbaijan  ] and eastern [MISC Caspian  ] gas westwards , so too is a transparent and commercially viable oil transit arrangement through [LOC Azerbaijan  ] essential to attract [ORG TengizChevroil  ] ( [ORG TCO  ] ) and expected Kashagan volumes . 
[LOC Azerbaijan  ] needs to be reminded that [MISC North Caspian  ] shippers seek secure , safe , predictable and transparent long-term arrangements for transit of oil through [LOC Azerbaijan  ] before they can commit to shipping volumes westwards , and that they too have “other options.” BP-GOAJ RELATIONS ----------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Finally , you should be aware of the current status of negotiations between the [ORG AIOC Consortium  ] headed by [ORG BP  ] ( responsible for the [LOC ACG  ] field , which provides the bulk of [ORG GOAJ  ] income ) and the [ORG GOAJ  ] . 
The [ORG Consortium  ] is seeking extension of the current [MISC Production Sharing Agreement  ] ( [ORG PSA  ] ) so that it can make the necessary investments to increase oil recovery from this mega-field . 
It also seeks the rights to develop “ACG [ORG Deep Gas  ] , ” which is a major source of undeveloped gas lying under the area currently being developed by the [ORG AIOC Consortium  ] . 
However , there has been no progress on these issues for a while , as the [ORG GOAJ  ] is unwilling to discuss them until it resolves the following issues with AIOC: - [ORG Zero Balance Date  ] ( [ORG ZBD  ] ) : Under the current [ORG BTC PSA  ] , after the [ORG BTC Consortium  ] loses ownership of the pipeline in 2026 , the [ORG Consortium  ] members still reserve the rights to ship their oil at a discount through the pipeline . 
Additionally , [ORG SOCAR  ] is sorely grieved by a [ORG PSA  ] clause which decreases [ORG GOAJ  ] ownership of the [ORG BTC  ] pipeline after [ORG ZBD  ] as Northern [MISC Caspian  ] ( [MISC Kazakh  ] ) crude volumes through [ORG BTC  ] increase . 
[ORG SOCAR  ] wants full ownership of [ORG BTC  ] after [ORG ZBD  ] , with the right to charge whatever tariffs it wishes. - Total Transportation Costs ( [ORG TTC  ] ) : In the current [ORG PSA  ] there is a link between the cost of transportation and the split of profit oil , which can swing the profit split at most five percent . 
[ORG TTC  ] calculations stretched out until 2016 make a significant potential difference in revenue split , and [ORG SOCAR  ] wants to revisit this issue . 
[ORG SOCAR  ] President [PER Rovnaq Abdullayev  ] has been emboldened by his success in handling of the “rate of return” dispute , which dealt with the timing of when the various shifts in splitting profit oil were to occur . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX - [MISC Baku-Supsa:  ] The [MISC Baku-Supsa  ] pipeline , with a capacity of 100 to 150 thousand barrels a day , is currently under [ORG AIOC Consortium  ] ownership and control , but [ORG SOCAR  ] and the [ORG GOAJ  ] want it for themselves so that they can set tariffs and ship volumes as they see fit .
