( C ) Summary . 
Federal Deputy [PER Antonio Carlos Magalhaes Neto  ] ( " [ORG ACM Neto  ] " ) , of the [MISC Democrats  ] party ( " [MISC DEM  ] , " formerly called the [ORG Liberal Front Party  ] , [ORG PFL  ] ) , of [LOC Bahia  ] believes President [PER Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  ] defused a ticking bomb in the military this week by reversing his decision not to punish insubordinate air traffic controllers who shut down air traffic on March 30 . 
[ORG ACM Neto  ] ( protect ) told poloff on April 4 there are other such " bombs " in the military because some in the lower ranks -- corporals , sergeants , and even lieutenants -- are unhappy about a number of things , starting with salaries . 
[ORG ACM Neto  ] , a staunch opponent of [PER Lula  ] 's administration , said opposition figures have obtained documents going back four years , to the time [PER Lula  ] took office , that proving the [PER Lula  ] administration knew of problems in the [MISC Brazilian  ] air traffic control system . 
He said he believes a congressional investigation into the air traffic crisis will reveal serious corruption and incompetence in [LOC Infraero  ] , the government body that runs the country 's airports , under the management of [PER Carlos Wilson  ] , a [PER Lula  ] appointee . 
He said rumors are circulating that government officials took bribes to favor two major airlines and channeled the funds into political campaigns . 
End summary . 
[PER Lula  ] " Contained " the Problem in the Military , For Now --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG ACM Neto  ] condemned the [PER Lula  ] administration 's " complete lack of leadership " on the air traffic crisis . 
He told poloff on April 4 that opposition politicians have obtained documents going back four years ) the time frame covering [PER Lula  ] 's first term ) showing that the [PER Lula  ] administration was aware of serious deficiencies in air traffic . 
[ORG ACM Neto  ] harshly criticized [PER Lula  ] 's handling of the March 30 strike by air traffic controllers . 
He said [PER Lula  ] 's decision to reverse himself and support punishment and even prosecution of rebellious sergeants " contained " the problem ) for now - and defused a " bomb . 
" But , he stressed , the " lack of hierarchy is dangerous , " and there are pockets of unhappiness ; " other bombs , " ARE out there among the lower enlisted ranks , and even among lieutenants , and they could go off . 
[ORG ACM Neto  ] said he was not suggesting a revolt by the armed forces , but rather that some in the lower military ranks are unhappy with salaries , long hours ( in the case of air traffic controllers ) , and other conditions . 
This , coupled with uncorrected disobedience , is a dangerous formula , he said . 
[ORG ACM Neto  ] said the air traffic strike on March 30 was the most serious revolt by the military since 1963 . 
He said the [MISC DEM  ] does not and should not support the controllers' action , but they have grievances and the government has done absolutely nothing . 
He accused the [PER Lula  ] administration of a complete lack of leadership to address a problem they have known about for four years . 
Rumors That [MISC Airlines Paid Bribes  ] That Went to Government Campaigns --------------------------------------------- ----------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG ACM Neto  ] told poloff that the [ORG Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry  ] ( " [MISC CPI  ] " ) , if it is created , is likely to become a wide-ranging investigation and no one can predict what its eventual scope will be . 
He revealed that there are unsubstantiated rumors in the [ORG Congress  ] ) which any [MISC CPI  ] on air traffic would undoubtedly investigate ) that after the collapse of [LOC Varig  ] , administration officials took bribes to ensure that the two remaining large national airlines , [ORG TAM  ] and [ORG Gol  ] , were ensured a dominant position in the market . 
He said the government is impeding market access and expansion by smaller companies to fill the void left by [LOC Varig  ] , leaving [ORG TAM  ] and [ORG Gol  ] the lion 's share of the commercial aviation business . 
These payments , according to the rumors , were channeled into campaign coffers . 
[ORG ACM Neto  ] did not say which parties in the government coalition might have benefited from [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000598 002 OF 002 these illegal payments . 
[ORG Parliamentary Inquiry Will Reveal Corruption  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG ACM Neto  ] said that he expected a [MISC CPI  ] would also reveal irregularities in contracting carried out by [LOC Infraero  ] , the state company that runs the airports , especially while it was managed by [PER Carlos Wilson  ] , a [PER Lula  ] appointee . 
( Note: [PER Carlos Wilson  ] is now a Federal Deputy from the [ORG Workers Party  ] , representing [ORG Pernambuco  ] . 
He was president of [LOC Infraero  ] from 2003 to 2006 , and oversaw new construction and major upgrades at several airports , including [LOC Recife  ] , [LOC Congonhas  ] , [LOC Belo Horizonte  ] , and others . 
End note . 
) [ORG ACM Neto  ] said there had been all manner of contractual malfeasance for these projects . 
Moreover , he said , [LOC Infraero  ] was negligent in its duty to maintain runways and equipment , while it proceeded to " turn the airports into shopping malls . 
" He said the " black holes " in air traffic control , such as the location where [ORG Gol  ] flight 1907 and an [MISC Embraer Legacy  ] jet collided last September 29 , resulting in [LOC Brazil  ] 's worst air disaster and the loss of 154 lives , were an example of the government 's overall failure - both on the part of the [ORG Air Force  ] , which is wholly responsible for running the air traffic control system , as well as [LOC Infraero  ] , the civilian agency that runs and maintains the airports - to address persistent technical deficiencies . 
Comment ------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Comment . 
[ORG ACM Neto  ] is in the opposition and it is natural for him to allege wrongdoing , lack of leadership and incompetence . 
Clearly there is a political agenda behind his statements . 
But the allegations of corruption in [LOC Infraero  ] that he described would fit squarely within a pattern of corruption in [PER Lula  ] 's first term , and is entirely plausible . 
Even if true , [PER Lula  ] could probably get away with saying he did not know , as he successfully did with past scandals . 
The allegation that bribes were taken and recycled into political campaigns presents a far more serious danger to the administration , since it could strike the [ORG PT  ] and/or the government at a very senior level , and [PER Lula  ] would have to clean house ( again ) , while claiming he did not know . 
It could generate another far-reaching [MISC CPI  ] with an unpredictable outcome , even if it is never substantiated. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Comment , continued . 
[ORG ACM Neto  ] 's tour d'horizon of the air traffic crisis also echoes our conviction that [PER Lula  ] 's government continues to suffer from a profound lack of decisive executive competence , rendering it incapable of dealing simultaneously with routine policy making and looming crises . 
It can carry out a major income redistribution program , but it is utterly incapable of addressing the major structural problems that have resulted in six months of air havoc . 
In a country the size of [LOC Brazil  ] , where air travel is essential to business and livelihoods , this represents a huge failure of [PER Lula  ] 's leadership .
