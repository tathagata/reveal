[PER Poloff  ] delivered reftel 's talking points and draft dip notes , July 5 , to [PER Virginia Toniatti  ] , the [ORG MFA  ] 's General Coordinator Against [MISC Transnational Crime  ] ( [ORG COCIT  ] ) .

Text of [ORG Dip Note  ] 79 ( ref B ) [ORG COCIT  ] / DEUC / 079 / PEXT-BRAS-EUA - September 9 , 2005 a . 
The [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] presents its compliments to the [ORG Embassy  ] of the [LOC United States  ] of [LOC America  ] and has the honor to refer to [ORG Dip Note  ] #250 sent by the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Embassy  ] on 26 July 2005 , regarding the concession of additional privileges and immunities to [LOC U.S  ] military personnel participating in joint military exercises in [MISC Brazilian  ] territory . 
The [ORG Ministry  ] regrets not to be in agreement with all the terms of the referred note and reminds the [ORG Embassy  ] that the subject has been under discussion , via exchange of correspondence with the [ORG Embassy  ] , since September 2002 , and the last manifestation from the [MISC Brazilian  ] Government in this respect was stated in [ORG Dip Note  ] #050 , dated 4 July 2005. b . 
The [ORG Ministry  ] is not in the position to provide additional guarantees to the status of privileged to [LOC U.S.  ] military personnel . 
The [ORG GOB  ] understanding is that the concession of additional immunities of jurisdiction to [LOC U.S.  ] personnel involved in joint exercises in [LOC Brazil  ] is subject to the terms established by the 1961 [ORG Vienna Convention  ] on [ORG Diplomatic Relations  ] , and based on the principle of juridical equality of states , and on the constitutional principle of isonomy among nationals and foreigners. c . 
As stated in paragraph 4 of the referred note #50 , the [MISC Brazilian  ] Law accepts the rules of [ORG International Law  ] that establishes that foreign military vessels and aircrafts enjoy extraterritoriality . 
In this sense , crimes committed aboard these vessels and aircrafts are not subject to the [MISC Brazilian  ] legislation . 
In the same way , crimes committed in [MISC Brazilian  ] territory by foreign military personnel , while fulfilling their duties , are not subject to [MISC Brazilian  ] jurisdiction , but to the jurisdiction of the perpetrator 's country of nationality . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] courts , however , have jurisdiction over crimes committed by foreign military personnel , in [MISC Brazilian  ] territory , when they are not in the fulfillment of the duties related to joint military exercises with the [MISC Brazilian  ] Armed Forces . 
In this last case , [MISC Brazilian  ] courts would act independently of any consultation between the two governments , based on constitutional principles that establish the separation of powers in the [MISC Republic.  ] d . 
Under these conditions , the [ORG Ministry  ] stresses to the [ORG Embassy  ] that , while organizing joint military exercises in the [MISC Brazilian  ] territory , the officials involved must take these facts referred above into consideration. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
Text of [ORG Dip Note  ] 50 referred to in paragraph 2.a [ORG COCIT  ] / DEUC / SPD / 050 / PEXT-BRAS-EUA - July 4 , 2005 a . 
The [ORG Ministry of Foreign Relations  ] compliments the [ORG Embassy  ] of the [LOC United States  ] of [LOC America  ] and has the honor to refer to [ORG Diplomatic Note  ] number 181 from the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Embassy  ] , dated June 13 , 2005 , about the concession of privileges and additional immunities , for the designation of [LOC U.S.  ] militaries to participate in military exercises together with the [MISC Brazilian  ] Forces in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
The [ORG Ministry  ] agrees that the issue has been object of exchange of notes with the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Embassy  ] since September , 2002 , and that the position of the [MISC Brazilian  ] Government was transmitted to the [LOC U.S.  ] Government on notes number 91 ( 10-04-2002 ) , 08 ( 02-04-2005 ) and 15 ( 03-08-2005 ) . b . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] Government has no means to assure the [LOC U.S.  ] militaries any additional guarantees as a status of privilege , as an example of the personnel condition as temporary diplomatic mission , based in the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Liaison Office in Brazil  ] . 
The concession of equivalent diplomatic status granted to administrative and technical [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001365 002.2 OF 002 personnel to the [ORG Embassy  ] to [LOC U.S.  ] militaries involved in joint exercises with [LOC Brazil  ] , shall necessarily fall into what the 1961 [ORG Vienna Convention  ] states about [MISC Diplomatic Relations  ] ( noted in articles 29 , 31 and 37 ) c . 
The [ORG Ministry  ] considers that the terms the request was made would hinder that such concession be in accordance with the jurisdiction of National courts to judge as crimes of [LOC U.S.  ] militaries in [LOC Brazil  ] , according to the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Penal Law  ] . 
This would also go against the [ORG Principle  ] of [ORG Equal Jurisdiction of States  ] , the [ORG Constitutional Principle of Isonomy  ] between [ORG Nationals  ] and Foreigners and the [MISC Brazilian  ] Practice in similar cases. d . 
The [ORG Ministry  ] has reiterated to the [ORG Embassy  ] that , up to this moment , there has not been any agreements between Governments of both countries regarding this matter and that the [MISC Brazilian  ] Law agrees with the [ORG International Law  ] , which foreign military ships and aircrafts avail of extraterritoliality . 
Having mentioned this , crimes committed on such ships and aircrafts are not object to the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Law  ] . 
In addition , crimes committed on the [MISC Brazilian  ] grounds by foreign military agents while in their duties are not submitted to the [MISC Brazilian  ] jurisdiction , but the State of the incumbent 's nationality . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] jurisdiction acts , however , in cases of crimes committed by foreign militaries if they are not in duties related to military exercises with the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Authorities.  ] e . 
The [ORG Ministry  ] reminds the [ORG Embassy  ] that the [MISC Brazilian  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] Army have been working on joint military exercises on [MISC Brazilian  ] grounds in a smooth and uninterrupted way for almost half century . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] Government has made sure that basic conditions to the full development of their activities be guaranteed to the participants of such exercises . 
The [ORG Ministry  ] notes the existence of the joint exercise " [LOC PKO South  ] " on [MISC Brazilian  ] soil and the cancellation of the " [MISC Patriot  ] [PER Angel  ] " exercise in common agreement between [ORG Air Force  ] authorities of both countries. f . 
The [ORG Ministry  ] transmits to the [ORG Embassy  ] that the [MISC Brazilian  ] Government expects that The [MISC Brazilian  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] Forces continue with their joint military exercises , such as the upcoming edition of [LOC UNITAS  ] . 
To stress so , the [ORG Ministry  ] reiterates the position of the [MISC Brazilian  ] Government that such exercises be developed in the same terms as previous exercises regarding the immunity of jurisdiction to foreign militaries ( terms previously mentioned in paragraph 4 ) . 
[LOC Brazil  ] does not consider that any fact or initiative have occurred in order to justify changes in the relations between [MISC Brazilian  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] militaries or any cancellation of exercises that have been developed for years in an excellent prosperous atmosphere. g . 
Finally , The [ORG Ministry  ] expresses to the [ORG Embassy  ] that communications regarding this matter , in order to be considered official , shall be directed to [ORG Itamaraty  ] , the authority with proper responsibilities , and the body that handles grants of privileges and immunities to foreign officers who visit the country .
