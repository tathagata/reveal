Having forwarded a copy of the [MISC Polish  ] invitation May 31 , post spoke with [ORG MFA Acting Political  ] Director [PER Thordur Bjarni Gudjonsson  ] June 9 to reiterate the significance of the [ORG Proliferation Security Initiative High Level Political Meeting  ] as well as the planned high level of [LOC U.S.  ] representation . 
[PER Gudjonsson  ] reported that [LOC Reykjavik  ] had regretfully concluded June 8 that it had inadequate staff resources to send someone to the June 23 meeting in [LOC Warsaw.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
Comment: The [MISC Icelandic  ] MFA is indeed stretched especially thin at present: Political Director [PER Bergdis Ellertsdottir  ] is on maternity leave until September ; [LOC Reykjavik  ] hosted a Council of [LOC Baltic Sea States  ] summit June 8 ( even though it is not on the [LOC Baltic Sea  ] ) ; and the [ORG GOI  ] announced this week that Prime Minister [PER Halldor Asgrimsson  ] would step down this month and that Foreign Minister [PER Geir Haarde  ] would replace him . 
No new FM has yet been named , and career [MISC Icelandic  ] diplomats say they do not yet have a clear read on whom the Government is likely to name as [PER Haarde  ] 's successor .
